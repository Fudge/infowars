[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:31.640]  we are live on this Monday February 8 2016 this is the Alex Jones show Alex is on the road so
[00:31.640 --> 00:35.960]  I'll be your host for the next three hours I'm Paul Joseph Watson and then David Knight's coming
[00:35.960 --> 00:41.600]  in for the fourth hour overdrive but we've got an action-packed show because Alex will be on
[00:41.600 --> 00:48.640]  air just after the start the second hour with his take on the debate on Saturday night Donald Trump
[00:48.640 --> 00:54.840]  the latest in the US election race we've also got Richard Reeves on the ground in New Hampshire
[00:54.840 --> 01:00.880]  he'll be on in the third hour to give us the latest and then Joe Biggs a lot of you will have
[01:00.880 --> 01:07.720]  seen this alarming video that Joe posted on his Twitter last night from Periscope where he appeared
[01:07.720 --> 01:13.680]  to be tackled by a security guard and was later placed in handcuffs we're gonna get the full
[01:13.680 --> 01:20.160]  story on what transpired and what's gonna happen in the aftermath of that from Joe Biggs in studio
[01:20.160 --> 01:26.400]  himself but for the next hour it's basically going to be a news blitz with me if we get time to take
[01:26.400 --> 01:32.160]  your calls later in the show we will do so but one of the top stories up on infowalls.com this
[01:32.160 --> 01:38.240]  morning is if anyone's going to hell it's Madeline Albright now you may have heard of this controversy
[01:38.240 --> 01:44.600]  over the weekend on Saturday Albright made a comment during a Clinton campaign rally basically
[01:44.600 --> 01:52.360]  saying that there's a special place in hell for young women who don't vote for Hillary Clinton so
[01:52.360 --> 01:58.400]  she basically said if you don't vote for Hillary because ostensibly she has a vagina and so do
[01:58.400 --> 02:03.440]  you that's basically her only platform at the moment then you're going to hell she actually
[02:03.440 --> 02:10.840]  said that and we're gonna delve into why Madeline Albright is quite the authority on whether or
[02:10.840 --> 02:17.160]  not people are going to hell because given her own comments in the past justifying the slaughter
[02:17.160 --> 02:24.640]  of 500,000 Iraqi children she may indeed if you believe in hell be a prime candidate for a one-way
[02:24.640 --> 02:32.280]  ticket so we're gonna play that video and flashback to Albright's comments from 1996 then again on
[02:32.280 --> 02:37.960]  the subject of Hillary Gloria Steinem the feminist the icon of the feminism movement has come out
[02:37.960 --> 02:44.760]  and basically said that people young women who are voting for Bernie Sanders are only doing so to
[02:44.760 --> 02:50.880]  meet boys not because they actually believe in his socialist rhetoric or have thought about his
[02:50.880 --> 02:57.640]  campaign platform hall but they're simply doing it to meet young boys this is a feminist engaging
[02:57.640 --> 03:03.680]  in brazen misogyny saying that young women are so ditzy they're only getting involved to meet
[03:03.680 --> 03:09.280]  other Bernie Sanders campaign supporters who are boys but that's getting news attention what
[03:09.280 --> 03:14.840]  isn't getting news attention is something even more flagrantly ridiculous that Steinem said during
[03:14.840 --> 03:21.880]  this Bill Maher interview which was about claiming basically that the Prophet Muhammad was a reformer
[03:21.880 --> 03:28.520]  for women the Prophet Muhammad who had sex slaves who consummated his marriage to a six year old
[03:28.520 --> 03:35.360]  girl by having sex with her when she was nine he's being now propelled but on a pedestal as a great
[03:35.360 --> 03:43.000]  reformer for women even as we have this massive massive migrant rape crisis sweeping Europe so
[03:43.000 --> 03:47.160]  again completely insane comments we're going to play the clip we're going to delve into the
[03:47.160 --> 03:53.920]  hypocrisy and again every single day we get these kind of stories and there's another deluge it's
[03:53.920 --> 03:59.280]  just impossible to keep track now Iraqi migrant rapes a 10 year old boy at a swimming pool in
[03:59.280 --> 04:04.120]  Vienna and he thought it was just completely normal that there was nothing wrong with it he was
[04:04.120 --> 04:09.760]  sexually frustrated so he just went ahead and did it he didn't even try to escape so we're
[04:09.760 --> 04:16.160]  going to get into the latest again on the migrant crisis now we have Swedish police admitting that
[04:16.160 --> 04:22.680]  they have a special code to cover up crimes involving migrants because of course we can't
[04:22.680 --> 04:28.720]  let the public hear about it we can't let this be reported in the media throughout Europe because
[04:28.720 --> 04:35.840]  as the German police said they don't want to legitimize critics of mass migration so now not
[04:35.840 --> 04:42.080]  only do we have a media cover-up of this scandal we've got a police cover-up as well in Sweden
[04:42.080 --> 04:47.920]  and of course this comes on the heels of the massive Pegida marches in European cities nationwide
[04:47.920 --> 04:52.960]  this weekend we're going to cover that as well and more news ahead in the next segment of the
[04:52.960 --> 05:00.920]  Alex Jones show live info wars.com join us after the break a pro abortion group is attacking a
[05:00.920 --> 05:05.600]  Doritos Super Bowl ad for humanizing baby fetuses in the ad a pregnant woman is getting an
[05:05.600 --> 05:10.440]  ultrasound why man besides her realizes the unborn baby will move in the direction of the Doritos
[05:10.440 --> 05:14.040]  he's snacking on the man toys with the baby attempting in vain to reach the chips from the
[05:14.040 --> 05:18.000]  womb until the mother throws the Doritos across the room which prompts a child to launch itself
[05:18.000 --> 05:22.520]  outside mom and towards the chips in response a national abortion reproductive rights action
[05:22.520 --> 05:27.720]  league said the ad used an anti-choice tactic of humanizing fetuses the statement or source
[05:27.720 --> 05:32.200]  how neural and similar groups to humanize the unborn in a vain attempt to justify abortions
[05:32.200 --> 05:36.160]  especially in the aftermath of the Planned Parenthood sting videos exposing its officials
[05:36.160 --> 05:40.880]  admitting they sell a board of baby organs for profit now however didn't stop there the group
[05:40.880 --> 05:45.560]  also called out a Snickers ad for being transphobic and a Hyundai ad for shown a dad take away his
[05:45.560 --> 05:49.680]  daughter's autonomy this is all part of the political correctness campaign spearheaded by
[05:49.680 --> 05:54.560]  the authoritarian left to not only control free speech but also how people think this is the

[08:29.840 --> 08:34.920]  we got a ton of news to cover starting with this out of infowalls.com. If anyone's going
[08:34.920 --> 08:40.360]  to hell, it's Madeline Albright. Now she's caused controversy over comments she made
[08:40.360 --> 08:46.680]  during a Clinton campaign rally on Saturday when she said there's a special place reserved
[08:46.680 --> 08:52.040]  in hell for women who don't vote for Hillary Clinton. Here's the clip.
[08:52.040 --> 08:56.280]  We can tell our story about how we climbed the ladder and a lot of you younger women
[08:56.280 --> 09:03.120]  don't think you have to, it's been done. It's not done and you have to help. Hillary Clinton
[09:03.120 --> 09:09.400]  will always be there for you. And just remember there's a special place in hell for women
[09:09.400 --> 09:16.400]  who don't help each other. That was former Secretary of State and UN Ambassador Madeline
[09:16.400 --> 09:20.840]  Albright saying there's a special place reserved in hell for young women who don't vote for
[09:20.840 --> 09:25.840]  Hillary Clinton. Again, suggesting that they will go to hell, literally they will go to
[09:25.840 --> 09:29.680]  hell if they don't vote for Hillary. Now, of course, there are two facets to this, one
[09:29.680 --> 09:37.040]  of which is Hillary Clinton has got basically no platform whatsoever. She's running on name
[09:37.040 --> 09:42.280]  recognition alone. She's completely collapsed in the polls. At one point she had a two-to-one
[09:42.280 --> 09:49.040]  lead over Bernie Sanders. Again, not venerating that anything Sanders stands for, but she
[09:49.040 --> 09:53.400]  was the establishment pick. We pointed that out during Bilderberg last year in Austria
[09:53.400 --> 09:58.120]  that all the big money was behind her. The decision had been made. She stepped down for
[09:58.120 --> 10:05.080]  Obama back in 2008. But this time around, the elite were behind Hillary. But she has
[10:05.080 --> 10:10.440]  no platform. The only platform she's got is, I'm a feminist. I stand for women. I have
[10:10.440 --> 10:17.200]  a vagina. You have a vagina. Vote for me. Of course, that's insidiously ironic because
[10:17.200 --> 10:22.720]  of the revelations we've had on this show from Roger Stone, where basically Hillary
[10:22.720 --> 10:29.520]  has hired people to terrorize Bill Clinton's alleged rape victims. Those are her, quote,
[10:29.520 --> 10:34.720]  feminist credentials. So again, Madeleine Albright basically gets up and says, you have
[10:34.720 --> 10:39.320]  to vote for Hillary because she has a vagina. You have a vagina. And that's it. That's
[10:39.320 --> 10:45.880]  the sum of her campaign. And you're going to hell if you don't. Now, those are quite
[10:45.880 --> 10:50.080]  rich words coming from Madeleine Albright. But I think we should take them seriously
[10:50.080 --> 10:56.800]  because she should be treated as quite the authority on who is going to hell given that
[10:56.800 --> 11:02.600]  she likely has a one-way ticket. And the reason I say that is because of these, again, absolutely
[11:02.600 --> 11:07.320]  astounding remarks that we've covered time and time again, but they're evergreen.
[11:07.320 --> 11:13.880]  During an interview with 60 Minutes in 1996, Albright, who was then ambassador to the United
[11:13.880 --> 11:22.400]  Nations, infamously suggested that half a million dead Iraqi children due to UN sanctions
[11:22.400 --> 11:27.640]  was a price worth paying. Here's the clip from 60 Minutes.
[11:27.640 --> 11:32.920]  We have heard that a half a million children have died. I mean, that's more children than
[11:32.920 --> 11:42.360]  died in Hiroshima. And, you know, is the price worth it? I think this is a very hard choice,
[11:42.360 --> 11:47.000]  but the price we think the price is worth it.
[11:47.000 --> 11:52.720]  That's Madeleine Albright. Back in 96 saying the price of half a million dead Iraqi children
[11:52.720 --> 11:57.920]  is, quote, worth it. So again, she was saying basically the sanctions that killed that amount
[11:57.920 --> 12:04.120]  of children in Iraq at the time being carried out by the UN with U.S. support, that geopolitical
[12:04.120 --> 12:11.200]  motive justified the mass slaughter of children. Somebody who lines up behind that kind of
[12:11.200 --> 12:17.160]  bloodthirsty belief, I would venture, has a pretty good grasp on whether she's going
[12:17.160 --> 12:22.360]  to hell or not. So now she's lecturing other people about having a special place reserved
[12:22.360 --> 12:28.840]  in Hades. I'm sure Madeleine Albright, given her history, will be joining them. And of
[12:28.840 --> 12:32.720]  course, after that interview, she kind of backtracked and said, oh, I didn't really
[12:32.720 --> 12:38.720]  mean it, but still barbed Leslie Stahl, the interviewer there, and said she was an Iraqi
[12:38.720 --> 12:44.280]  propagandist. So again, she never really backed away from those comments. They were absolutely
[12:44.280 --> 12:50.040]  disgusting at the time, and they still are. So for her to lecture other people on where
[12:50.040 --> 12:53.240]  their souls going to end up is pretty rich indeed.
[12:53.240 --> 12:59.560]  Now we got another story up here from Liberty Blitzkrieg. Again on Hillary, desperate for
[12:59.560 --> 13:07.040]  Hillary feminist icon Gloria Steinem claims young women support Sanders to attract boys.
[13:07.040 --> 13:13.040]  This is Gloria Steinem, the top feminist who founded Miss Magazine with the financial support
[13:13.040 --> 13:21.200]  of the CIA. This is Gloria Steinem, the woman who supports abortion, celebrates abortion
[13:21.200 --> 13:27.520]  with special t-shirts and special campaigns. Again, what side you fall on abortion is a
[13:27.520 --> 13:34.480]  different issue. It should be treated as a somber, sober affair. It should never be celebrated,
[13:34.480 --> 13:39.240]  which is what people like Gloria Steinem do. So she's attracted a lot of news headlines
[13:39.240 --> 13:45.200]  over the weekend for these comments, and this is a clip from CNN.
[13:45.200 --> 13:51.400]  A feminist icon is now apologizing about her comments on young women who support Bernie
[13:51.400 --> 13:57.760]  Sanders on Friday nights. Real time with Bill Maher, Gloria Steinem raised a lot of eyebrows
[13:57.760 --> 14:05.840]  when she suggested young women were backing Sanders just so they could meet young men.
[14:05.840 --> 14:09.080]  When you're young, you're thinking, you know, where are the boys? The boys are with Bernie
[14:09.080 --> 14:19.000]  or, you know. But today on Facebook, she issued an about face. She wrote, in a case of talk
[14:19.000 --> 14:24.080]  show interrupts, interruptus, I should say, I misspoke on the Bill Maher show recently
[14:24.080 --> 14:29.240]  and apologize for what's being interpreted as implying young women aren't serious in
[14:29.240 --> 14:35.440]  their politics. What I had just said on the same show was the opposite. Young women are
[14:35.440 --> 14:41.480]  active, mad as hell about what's happening to them, graduating in debt, but averaging
[14:41.480 --> 14:46.760]  a million dollars less over their lifetimes to pay it back, whether they gravitate to
[14:46.760 --> 14:53.760]  Bernie or Hillary, young women are activists and feminists in greater numbers than ever
[14:53.760 --> 14:57.960]  before. So that is Gloria Steinem, the feminist icon
[14:57.960 --> 15:03.160]  who is now 80 years old. Again, she went on Bill Maher and said, young women are only
[15:03.160 --> 15:10.760]  voting for Bernie Sanders to meet boys. Again, Gloria Steinem is in the tank for Hillary.
[15:10.760 --> 15:16.640]  So she's prepared to go to outright misogyny and say that young women had basically just
[15:16.640 --> 15:21.200]  ditsy idiots who don't have any political understanding, can't make political choices
[15:21.200 --> 15:26.940]  of their own, and are only taking that decision to support Sanders to meet members of the
[15:26.940 --> 15:33.120]  opposite sex. So again, she tried to backtrack. It's still blown up in her face. But what's
[15:33.120 --> 15:39.000]  interesting I find about this Bill Maher appearance that happened back on Friday was that she
[15:39.000 --> 15:45.400]  made even more bizarre comments that haven't really got as much press attention. And we're
[15:45.400 --> 15:49.320]  going to play this after the break because it's about a three minute clip. But basically
[15:49.320 --> 15:55.800]  she went on there and said that the Prophet Muhammad was a reformer for women. He was
[15:55.800 --> 16:01.880]  a great representative for women back in the seventh century because he married an estate
[16:01.880 --> 16:07.520]  agent, whatever that means, and because he passed laws that were pro women. Okay, this
[16:07.520 --> 16:14.680]  is an individual who had harems of sex slaves. This is an individual who married a six year
[16:14.680 --> 16:20.080]  old girl consummated the marriage basically raped her when she was nine years old. This
[16:20.080 --> 16:27.440]  is a prophet who is worshiped by people who institute Sharia law, an absolutely patriarchal
[16:27.440 --> 16:33.920]  system, a real patriarchal system of oppression, that for example, a woman can go to court
[16:33.920 --> 16:39.000]  and give eyewitness testimony that she was raped. It doesn't count. It doesn't count
[16:39.000 --> 16:44.440]  unless she's got two other male eyewitnesses who will back up her testimony. This is a
[16:44.440 --> 16:50.840]  system Sharia law, which men can divorce women by simply saying, I divorce you, women can't
[16:50.840 --> 16:58.200]  do the same. This is a system that has created what they call the rape game Tahrirosh, which
[16:58.200 --> 17:04.920]  again is now sweeping Europe via this migrant crisis. So to claim that the Prophet Muhammad
[17:04.920 --> 17:09.920]  and the Islam is somehow pro feminist, this is the argument she makes in this video, which
[17:09.920 --> 17:14.760]  we're going to play after the break. Again, it's completely ridiculous, especially given
[17:14.760 --> 17:19.800]  stories like this, which came out over the weekend. This is out of the Daily Mail. Iraqi
[17:19.800 --> 17:25.580]  migrant rapes a 10 year old boy at a swimming pool in Vienna and tells police it was a sexual
[17:25.580 --> 17:31.280]  emergency because he hadn't had sex in months. This is not out of the onion. This is the
[17:31.280 --> 17:37.160]  real story. And again, it's absolutely tragic. The 10 year old boy was so brutally raped
[17:37.160 --> 17:42.280]  by an Iraqi migrant in a swimming pool cubicle. And again, this is in Austria that he had
[17:42.280 --> 17:47.360]  to be hospitalized for his injuries. A lifeguard immediately called an ambulance after the boy
[17:47.360 --> 17:53.480]  went to him in floods of tears while the Iraqi was entertaining himself by repeatedly jumping
[17:53.480 --> 18:01.360]  off the three meter diving board. So this migrant rapes a child in the locker room. And
[18:01.360 --> 18:07.800]  it's so normal to him. It's so routine. And it's so justifiable because he hadn't had
[18:07.800 --> 18:14.640]  sex in months. That just means you can go rape children and destroy their lives forever.
[18:14.640 --> 18:21.760]  He was so non plus by it. He didn't even try to escape after raping the child. He went
[18:21.760 --> 18:28.800]  back to the swimming pool. Police arrested him on the spot at the pool in Vienna. And
[18:28.800 --> 18:33.040]  during an interrogation, he told them that it was a sexual emergency as he had not had
[18:33.040 --> 18:39.040]  sex in four months. Again, this is what we're hearing out of these migrant camps. I get
[18:39.040 --> 18:45.200]  sent stories by people every single week. There was another one in Sweden recently where
[18:45.200 --> 18:53.040]  these rapes aren't being reported because in some cases, the victims sympathize with
[18:53.040 --> 18:59.080]  the rapist. This is why they call it Stockholm syndrome, which has now become Cologne syndrome
[18:59.080 --> 19:04.240]  after the mass molestation of women on New Year's Eve. So these volunteers in the migrant
[19:04.240 --> 19:10.440]  camps, the victims of rapes are actually refusing to report them to police, refusing
[19:10.440 --> 19:15.800]  to give their testimony to the media because they say the migrants are traumatized and
[19:15.800 --> 19:21.760]  they're just raping people because of the trauma that they were escaping. Even though
[19:21.760 --> 19:27.120]  the vast majority of them aren't even fleeing ISIS, they're not fleeing a war zone. Many
[19:27.120 --> 19:33.760]  of them are economic migrants who are flooding into Europe to claim benefits. But now even
[19:33.760 --> 19:39.360]  some of the victims of these rapes are refusing to report them because it's not politically
[19:39.360 --> 19:43.800]  correct and because they sympathize with the attacker. Obviously that didn't happen in
[19:43.800 --> 19:49.320]  the case of this four-ten-year-old boy who is now traumatized for life. While his attacker
[19:49.320 --> 19:54.600]  thought it was completely routine to be raping young boys, we'll be back with more news.
[19:54.600 --> 19:59.600]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live in 4Wallis.com for now.
[19:59.600 --> 20:03.520]  The following statements have not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to
[20:03.520 --> 20:08.800]  diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. Something shocking just happened in a Coast
[20:08.800 --> 20:13.520]  Guard unit in San Diego. The old guys in the unit have turned the tables and are now destroying
[20:13.520 --> 20:18.040]  the young bucks and head-to-head fitness tests. How is this even possible? Turns out,
[20:18.040 --> 20:22.080]  the old guys in this unit had been part of a special test group for a doctor-formulated
[20:22.080 --> 20:26.840]  fountain of youth drink called Patriot Power Greens. Patriot Power Greens has been so effective
[20:26.840 --> 20:30.640]  for many of the older soldiers that it's made their achy joints, stiff muscles, and lack
[20:30.640 --> 20:35.640]  of energy a thing of the past. Previously, this drink was only available to elite military
[20:35.640 --> 20:40.280]  units. But for a limited time, the creator of Patriot Power Greens has set aside a small
[20:40.280 --> 20:44.800]  number of free samples specifically for our conservative friends. All they ask is that
[20:44.800 --> 20:49.400]  you chip in a few bucks to cover shipping. To claim your free samples of Patriot Power
[20:49.400 --> 20:58.400]  Greens, go to Green75.com. That's Green75.com. Green75.com.

[24:10.760 --> 24:15.360]  We are back with Monday, February 8th edition of the Alex Jones Show. I'm your host, Paul
[24:15.360 --> 24:20.320]  Joseph Watson. We've got Alex popping in in the next hour along with Joe Biggs to talk
[24:20.320 --> 24:25.800]  about that incident which he recorded on Periscope last night when he was basically
[24:25.800 --> 24:30.760]  taken down by a security guard, later ended up in handcuffs. We're going to get Joe Biggs's
[24:30.760 --> 24:35.560]  take on what happened. A lot of people are asking about it. As far as I know, he's fine,
[24:35.560 --> 24:40.800]  he's okay, but he's going to tell us precisely what went down last night. But it's really
[24:40.800 --> 24:47.120]  important that you support us by buying the health products at infowarslife.com. And we've

[25:59.640 --> 26:04.000]  we're going to talk about some of the other products later in the show, but one which
[26:04.000 --> 26:11.120]  I managed to get my hands on when I was over in Austin just a few months ago was Brainforce.
[26:11.120 --> 26:15.920]  Now I've been taking Alpha Brain for quite a few years now, which has some of the similar
[26:15.920 --> 26:21.120]  ingredients and that was working quite well. So I decided to take some of the Brainforce.
[26:21.120 --> 26:27.000]  Now bearing in mind, this was basically the day after I landed, I had jet lag about three
[26:27.000 --> 26:34.320]  hours sleep and I had to do the whole three hour radio show the next morning. So obviously
[26:34.320 --> 26:39.960]  my brain was foggy, I was tired, it was difficult to concentrate, to prepare for a three hour
[26:39.960 --> 26:46.440]  show and talk for a three hour show, which is very difficult. So I think I took two Brainforce
[26:46.440 --> 26:51.640]  and my brain was completely supercharged. It felt like I'd had eight hours sleep, I
[26:51.640 --> 26:57.400]  was able to focus more on the news, was able to talk better. Again, being completely jet
[26:57.400 --> 27:03.080]  lagged on a few hours sleep, hosting a live radio show for three hours. So I really felt
[27:03.080 --> 27:08.160]  the difference with Brainforce. Again, Alpha Brain is quite similar, but with Brainforce,
[27:08.160 --> 27:13.960]  it seems to give you a quicker punch, a quicker pick me up to really sharpen your mind to
[27:13.960 --> 27:19.900]  focus your mind on whatever task it is that you're performing. So that was really beneficial
[27:19.900 --> 27:26.160]  to me. Brainforce in the end, it's available at infowarslife.com. Don't take too many of
[27:26.160 --> 27:32.040]  them because it's very powerful. I made that mistake once, but two or three again really
[27:32.040 --> 27:37.640]  sharpens the mind. I noticed personally I had a massive impact. So I would personally
[27:37.640 --> 27:45.120]  recommend that people get their hands on Brainforce again at infowarslife.com. Now we were talking
[27:45.120 --> 27:50.600]  before the break about an Iraqi migrant who thought it was so routine to run around raping
[27:50.600 --> 27:57.360]  children in Vienna, Austria, that he didn't even try to escape after he had raped a 10-year-old
[27:57.360 --> 28:03.440]  boy in a swimming pool or in the locker at a swimming pool. He went back to the diving
[28:03.440 --> 28:09.920]  board. The police actually arrested him in the swimming pool. So you've got more examples
[28:09.920 --> 28:16.200]  of this. Then you have Gloria Steinem going on Bill Maher and basically saying that there's
[28:16.200 --> 28:22.680]  no real problem when it comes to feminism and Islam because there are a lot of feminist
[28:22.680 --> 28:27.200]  Muslims in the Middle East who are standing up for women's rights. Well, there doesn't
[28:27.200 --> 28:32.440]  tend to be too many of them because they get acid thrown in their faces. They get attacked
[28:32.440 --> 28:38.880]  with stones and all manner of other things. The ones in the West also get attacked by
[28:38.880 --> 28:44.960]  the regressive left. We saw that in a story we had a few weeks ago where a left-wing group
[28:44.960 --> 28:53.640]  called Hope Not Hate created an internet list of anti-Muslim bigots which included a devout
[28:53.640 --> 29:00.880]  Muslim woman who campaigns against honor violence. She was listed by this left-wing group as
[29:00.880 --> 29:09.360]  an anti-Muslim bigger. So these are real feminists standing up for real women's rights underneath
[29:09.360 --> 29:16.280]  the crushing tyranny of a real patriarchy, unlike feminists in the West who are tearing
[29:16.280 --> 29:23.680]  their hair out over Roush V, this pickup artist who wrote a satirical blog about rape, planning
[29:23.680 --> 29:28.480]  to have some conferences in different European cities. Basically they tried to get in ban
[29:28.480 --> 29:33.640]  from every single country. Hundreds of thousands of people signed petitions. These are the same
[29:33.640 --> 29:40.760]  feminists that completely mute and absolve the migrant crisis rape scandal now sweeping
[29:40.760 --> 29:44.520]  Europe and say it's just a few assaults. We're going to get back into it after the break.
[29:44.520 --> 29:48.240]  This is the Alex Jones Show Live, Infowars.com. Don't go away.
[29:48.240 --> 29:58.920]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[29:58.920 --> 30:02.320]  Here's what Donald Trump must do to finish strong in New Hampshire according to veteran
[30:02.320 --> 30:07.640]  GOP strategist Roger Stone. He said, quote, Trump must return to the core issues that
[30:07.640 --> 30:12.760]  put him way, way out front. Sealing our borders, building the wall, recharging our economy,
[30:12.760 --> 30:16.920]  addressing trade imbalances, taking care of our veterans, and destroying ISIS. The veteran
[30:16.920 --> 30:20.800]  GOP strategist also said that Trump should talk about the Trump tax plan, praised by
[30:20.800 --> 30:25.640]  supply side guru Larry Kudrow. We know Trump is very, very rich. We want to hear how he
[30:25.640 --> 30:30.640]  would make us rich. Stone continues stating the rise of Rubio is very real. But Trump
[30:30.640 --> 30:34.880]  must dispatch Cruz as a viable candidate before he can face off with Rubio, who will continue
[30:34.880 --> 30:39.120]  to be a factor in the Palomado State. But Rubio may have already taken himself down considering
[30:39.120 --> 30:43.120]  his robotic performance during Saturday's debate in which he used the same memorized
[30:43.120 --> 30:47.240]  line at least eight times, showing he's a free program establishment candidate who
[30:47.240 --> 30:51.320]  can't speak off the cuff. The GOP strategist also revealed that credible polls have Trump
[30:51.320 --> 30:55.160]  running a substantially head where Romney McCain finished along African Americans. You can
[30:55.160 --> 30:59.120]  find out more at infowars.com. This is Kit Daniels reporting.

[31:58.760 --> 32:02.560]  Hey everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side and as many of you know
[32:02.560 --> 32:06.760]  I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy. You've all heard the shocking
[32:06.760 --> 32:11.560]  statistics. Despite spending trillions of dollars in health care nearly $10,000 per
[32:11.560 --> 32:16.280]  man, woman and child in this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and autoimmune
[32:16.280 --> 32:20.360]  illnesses are rampant. One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health
[32:20.360 --> 32:24.680]  challenge and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease. If you
[32:24.680 --> 32:27.600]  are dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor
[32:27.600 --> 32:32.520]  and longevity and you're looking for a convenient easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials
[32:32.520 --> 32:37.000]  into your day to day lives to guarantee that your body is getting the fundamental nutrients,
[32:37.000 --> 32:41.360]  the 90 essential vitamins, minerals, fats and amino acids it needs to do its healing
[32:41.360 --> 32:47.280]  work, you need to check out infowarslifes.com. Give your body the gift of good nutrition,
[32:47.280 --> 32:51.440]  head over to infowarslifes.com. Your body will be very grateful.
[32:51.440 --> 33:09.880]  On the web at infowarsteam.com. That's infowarsteam.com.
[33:09.880 --> 33:17.480]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[33:17.480 --> 33:26.080]  So, Gloria Steinem who is in the tank for Hillary because like Hillary apparently she's
[33:26.080 --> 33:31.680]  a feminist again completely let's just gloss over the fact that Hillary hired people to
[33:31.680 --> 33:38.200]  terrorize Bill Clinton's alleged rape victims. Those are Hillary's feminist credentials.
[33:38.200 --> 33:43.080]  So Gloria is in the tank for Hillary. She gets up on Bill Maher says that people who
[33:43.080 --> 33:49.440]  support Bernie Sanders, young women who support Sanders are just doing so to meet boys. Again
[33:49.440 --> 33:54.760]  if Bill Maher had said that or if any other male TV host had said that they would be accused
[33:54.760 --> 34:01.480]  of rampant misogyny. So she makes that gaffe, she tries to back track on that and then she
[34:01.480 --> 34:08.360]  makes comments that are even more bizarre about Islam, the Prophet Muhammad and feminism.
[34:08.360 --> 34:14.200]  This is the clip. Okay, so Hillary famously when she was first
[34:14.200 --> 34:21.760]  lady went to China and said I think women's rights are human rights. One of her greatest
[34:21.760 --> 34:28.360]  moments is first lady. She points to it often. Is feminism something that goes beyond our
[34:28.360 --> 34:32.400]  borders? Oh yes, absolutely. It is totally beyond
[34:32.400 --> 34:38.080]  borders. And that Hillary went was a great triumph because no one wanted her to go if
[34:38.080 --> 34:44.040]  you'll remember. I mean she went against the will of practically everybody. And the fact
[34:44.040 --> 34:50.200]  that she stood there and said women's rights are human rights coalesced what was already
[34:50.200 --> 34:55.520]  a global movement. But it was that kind of moment in time.
[34:55.520 --> 35:00.840]  Why aren't the way women are treated in the Muslim world considered more of a feminist
[35:00.840 --> 35:07.240]  cause? But it is. Are you kidding me? Of course it is. And the women in those countries considered
[35:07.240 --> 35:14.240]  a feminist cause. There are women there risking their lives every day. I mean all monotheism
[35:14.240 --> 35:23.080]  is a problem. Yes, but not quite as much. It depends. Islam being attached to the government
[35:23.080 --> 35:29.360]  is the problem. I mean if you have a theocracy it's a problem. Where we have Christian theocracies
[35:29.360 --> 35:33.080]  it's a problem. But 40 countries have Sharia law and under
[35:33.080 --> 35:38.720]  Sharia law I mean women's testimony in court is worth half as much. Man can get divorced
[35:38.720 --> 35:44.600]  by just saying I divorce the in front of a judge. A woman can't. A woman's property
[35:44.600 --> 35:48.880]  is not really her property. It goes to the man. I mean not to mention female genital
[35:48.880 --> 35:53.720]  mutilation and honor killings. And people are trying then I mean I can't handle any
[35:53.720 --> 35:59.120]  monotheism okay so I'm not here to. I can't either. No okay. But people are trying to
[35:59.120 --> 36:06.120]  take are trying to are trying to take I mean a lot of feminists in the Islamic world are
[36:06.120 --> 36:12.640]  are taking a dangerous thing to be are taking Mohammed's words and pointing out that you
[36:12.640 --> 36:16.200]  know his first wife was a real estate agent who was smarter than him and richer than him
[36:16.200 --> 36:23.120]  and he reformed law for real estate inheritance yes and I mean really for for what century
[36:23.120 --> 36:35.400]  seven. But he in his in his day in his day he was a reformer on a lot of issues for women
[36:35.400 --> 36:41.240]  and now it's a whole other story but I'll look it up really okay right. Listen only
[36:41.240 --> 36:45.880]  you could get me to defend any monotheism I can't believe I'm not asking you to defend
[36:45.880 --> 36:50.200]  this thing for the people who were like so for the civil rights movement in the sixties
[36:50.200 --> 36:54.880]  and against apartheid in the eighties it would seem sharia law and forty countries should
[36:54.880 --> 37:00.600]  be the cause of it is great it is and including for the women in those countries it's all
[37:00.600 --> 37:04.280]  for those women that's who we're sticking up for. All right thank you Gloria Steinem
[37:04.280 --> 37:10.760]  great good luck with the book. Okay that's Gloria Steinem on Bill Ma basically defending
[37:10.760 --> 37:17.720]  Islam in the context of feminism okay first she says oh there are a bunch of Muslim feminists
[37:17.720 --> 37:22.680]  who are standing up for women's rights and they're being supported by people in the West.
[37:22.680 --> 37:28.360]  Complete BS again as I said earlier in the show there was a Muslim reformer a devout
[37:28.360 --> 37:34.720]  Muslim who campaigns against honor violence she was listed as an anti-Muslim bigot by
[37:34.720 --> 37:41.800]  a left wing group in one of their major publications and why is it why is it that feminists don't
[37:41.800 --> 37:47.640]  call out the Muslim migrant rape culture that's now sweeping Europe. Well it's because in
[37:47.640 --> 37:55.200]  the oppression Olympics Muslims rank above women and because their whole dogma is based
[37:55.200 --> 38:02.640]  on politics and not principles they repeatedly turn a blind eye to this very real crisis
[38:02.640 --> 38:08.320]  that has now been imported into Europe again based on the treatment within the religion
[38:08.320 --> 38:15.200]  of Islam of women as second class citizens as enshrined under sharia law she says oh
[38:15.200 --> 38:20.320]  but it's only a problem when Islam is linked with government well it's linked with government
[38:20.320 --> 38:25.880]  in almost every country in the Middle East even when it isn't linked with government
[38:25.880 --> 38:31.960]  you have people in the tribal regions like the Taliban and other areas Afghanistan carrying
[38:31.960 --> 38:39.760]  out stonings of women because they were rape victims again stoning rape victims to death
[38:39.760 --> 38:46.320]  those cases in many examples are not linked with government so it's a problem either way
[38:46.320 --> 38:52.760]  and again it comes back to this feminist den identify Islam and sharia as an oppressive
[38:52.760 --> 39:02.880]  patriarchal system which it clearly is because it would completely eclipse the phony college
[39:02.880 --> 39:08.160]  rape culture hoax that they've been pushing for years and years and years it's been completely
[39:08.160 --> 39:14.480]  discredited the claim that one in five women on u.s. college campuses are victims of rape
[39:14.480 --> 39:19.880]  if you actually drill into the federal statistics there's no safer place for women than college
[39:19.880 --> 39:26.600]  campuses the original claim on which that statistic is based is some unreliable adult
[39:26.600 --> 39:33.280]  college study where they classified rape as touching it wasn't actually fall on sexual
[39:33.280 --> 39:40.000]  assault they've extrapolated that dodgy study out into now claiming that one in five women
[39:40.000 --> 39:46.720]  are raped on college campuses it's been debunked over and over again so when we try to introduce
[39:46.720 --> 39:52.320]  the idea that we've got a problem with a real rape culture which police in many of these
[39:52.320 --> 39:56.600]  European countries are now covering up because they might they think it might lead to civil
[39:56.600 --> 40:03.760]  unrest domestic disorder when we bring that up to feminists they're not interested because
[40:03.760 --> 40:10.440]  again it's about politics over principles they don't want to be seen as politically
[40:10.440 --> 40:17.960]  incorrect they don't really care about defending women they care about defending their regressive
[40:17.960 --> 40:25.160]  leftist dogma and it's not to review or to call out Islam for the rape culture which
[40:25.160 --> 40:30.840]  it is which we're now seeing across Europe again I read the story of the Daily Mail in
[40:30.840 --> 40:35.280]  the last segment Iraqi migrant rapes a 10 year old boy at swimming pool in Vienna tells
[40:35.280 --> 40:39.800]  police it was a sexual emergency because he hadn't had sex in months we've had Muslim
[40:39.800 --> 40:45.600]  girls Muslim women being raped all these different migrant centers and again in many cases it's
[40:45.600 --> 40:51.560]  not even being reported I've had messages sent to me privately over and over again of
[40:51.560 --> 40:55.800]  people saying well they're traumatized we don't want to report it because they've come
[40:55.800 --> 41:00.720]  from a war zone or whatever even though many of them haven't this kind of stuff isn't getting
[41:00.720 --> 41:06.960]  into the media in many cases the police in Sweden have come out with a special code where
[41:06.960 --> 41:12.360]  they if it's an incident involving a migrant a criminal incident they classify it under
[41:12.360 --> 41:19.160]  this code and it never sees the light of day again so as not to legitimize critics of
[41:19.160 --> 41:26.040]  this mass migration so you have the disconnect between feminists and Islam they will get
[41:26.040 --> 41:31.600]  riled up they will get angry they will screech and scream they will sign petitions in their
[41:31.600 --> 41:40.960]  hundreds of thousands to ban Roush V a pickup artist from organizing men's rights conferences
[41:40.960 --> 41:47.320]  in these different European cities a hundred thousand people in Canada alone signed a petition
[41:47.320 --> 41:54.320]  to ban Roush V from entering Canada similar numbers in Australia where do we where is
[41:54.320 --> 42:00.560]  that frustration where is that outrage when it comes to an incident like Cologne to incidents
[42:00.560 --> 42:05.240]  that happen in other European cities on the same night where hundreds and hundreds of
[42:05.240 --> 42:12.840]  women are molested where this game this rape game that's what they call it Taharoosh Gamiah
[42:12.840 --> 42:18.880]  the rape game is now being imported into the West where's the outrage from feminists well
[42:18.880 --> 42:25.600]  it's nonexistent and in Cologne the top feminist group there even blamed white German men even
[42:25.600 --> 42:32.240]  after the culprits of this Cologne molestation had been confirmed by the police to be Muslim
[42:32.240 --> 42:39.180]  migrants so again it's this bizarre kind of Stockholm syndrome mixed with rampant hypocrisy
[42:39.180 --> 42:45.840]  feminists are more offended by rape jokes they're more offended by Roush V who basically
[42:45.840 --> 42:51.760]  wrote a satirical blog saying a rape should be legalized which yes that's offensive yes
[42:51.760 --> 42:56.680]  that's disgusting even though he said it was satirical and people shouldn't be happy with
[42:56.680 --> 43:02.160]  him for saying that but the outrage devoted to that from feminist groups from feminist
[43:02.160 --> 43:09.440]  online has been a hundred times a thousand times the outrage devoted again to the Muslim
[43:09.440 --> 43:16.640]  migrant rape crisis which I've talked about on many occasions and it comes back to this
[43:16.640 --> 43:22.600]  people have termed it Stockholm syndrome of course the victim identifying with their
[43:22.600 --> 43:28.080]  captor and it goes deeper than that I mean I see it as a kind of intellectual fetal
[43:28.080 --> 43:36.160]  position where you've got what they call traumatic bonding so when a victim in this case you
[43:36.160 --> 43:41.120]  know feminists who should consider themselves potential victims if they support women's
[43:41.120 --> 43:48.000]  rights of this rape crisis that's being imported into the West you've got the victim adopting
[43:48.000 --> 43:55.040]  the same values as the aggressor because then mentally psychologically they cease to be
[43:55.040 --> 44:00.160]  a perceived threat so it's the equivalent of you know the ostrich sticking its head in
[44:00.160 --> 44:05.560]  the ground if they can pretend it's not a problem by identifying with the grievance
[44:05.560 --> 44:11.280]  of the migrant and saying oh they're just traumatized that's why they're sexually attacking people
[44:11.280 --> 44:18.400]  it's completely admissible it's understandable they're fleeing war if they believe that then
[44:18.400 --> 44:23.240]  that migrant rape threat no longer becomes a threat so they can stick their heads in
[44:23.240 --> 44:28.200]  the ground and ignore it and hope it goes away again instead of accepting the reality
[44:28.200 --> 44:34.940]  of the problem it's easier to deny it by identifying with the perpetrator and you could take it
[44:34.940 --> 44:41.120]  back even further again if you look into Stockholm syndrome this is what the psychologists
[44:41.120 --> 44:46.520]  have speculated about this and you can you can tie this to the cologne thing you can
[44:46.520 --> 44:51.760]  tie it to the mass Muslim rape scandal it could be it could have a basis in evolutionary
[44:51.760 --> 44:59.160]  psychology so of course back when humans lived in tribes women were commonly abducted by
[44:59.160 --> 45:06.200]  other tribes they were taken as trophies and then absorbed into that other tribe and of
[45:06.200 --> 45:13.640]  course the women at the time knew that resisting this meant almost certain death and we see
[45:13.640 --> 45:19.440]  that in the modern era with things like battered wife syndrome you know the the wife that's
[45:19.440 --> 45:25.360]  that's beaten up by her husband on a regular basis stays with him doesn't leave him because
[45:25.360 --> 45:30.400]  she's petrified so could we be seeing some kind of evolutionary psychology effect going
[45:30.400 --> 45:35.760]  on where they're downplaying this rape scandal this rape threat they're sticking their heads
[45:35.760 --> 45:41.200]  in the sand because it's kind of programmed into them tribally that they shouldn't resist
[45:41.200 --> 45:47.400]  that I think that's an interest in psychological avenue to consider but it's definitely Stockholm
[45:47.400 --> 45:52.800]  syndrome I mean politically speaking where you have you know people waving refugees
[45:52.800 --> 45:59.040]  welcome signs men in skirt showing up at these events you have feminists in cologne after
[45:59.040 --> 46:04.200]  the migrant work in the mass molestation on New Year's Eve going to the biggest migrant
[46:04.200 --> 46:10.640]  center in cologne not protesting against many of the same migrants who were probably involved
[46:10.640 --> 46:17.680]  in the attack but handing out roses it was called Stockholm syndrome maybe we should
[46:17.680 --> 46:24.840]  rename it cologne syndrome and again the the outrage the sheer outrage devoted to this
[46:24.840 --> 46:32.520]  Roush V story completely eclipsed any kind of outrage leveled against importing this
[46:32.520 --> 46:38.840]  real rape culture which has now resulted again in yet another incident an Iraqi migrant raping
[46:38.840 --> 46:44.800]  a 10-year-old boy at a swimming pool in Vienna he thought it was completely routine it was
[46:44.800 --> 46:50.960]  part of his culture you know he was probably almost shocked to be arrested for it and then
[46:50.960 --> 46:55.520]  we have the headlines like this out of the independent left-wing newspaper why are those
[46:55.520 --> 47:02.240]  rushing to condemn Muslim men so silent on Roush V and the global oppression of women
[47:02.240 --> 47:09.600]  so they're equating a guy who wrote a satirical blog about rape who has never raped anyone
[47:09.600 --> 47:14.680]  his followers have never raped anyone he gets a few dozen people to show up at these events
[47:14.680 --> 47:20.680]  they talk about men's rights issues they don't get together to rape women they're equating
[47:20.680 --> 47:27.120]  that and calling it the global oppression of women to this very real Muslim migrant
[47:27.120 --> 47:33.000]  rape scandal that for example in Rotherham England abducted dozens and dozens of young
[47:33.000 --> 47:39.240]  girls of children raped them over the course of 13 years the local government covered
[47:39.240 --> 47:45.000]  it up because they didn't want to be seen as politically incorrect that's real oppression
[47:45.000 --> 47:51.600]  when you've got 900 women being molested on one night in cologne in Hamburg in Zurich
[47:51.600 --> 47:56.880]  in all these other cities when you've got women being stoned to death rape victims when
[47:56.880 --> 48:02.480]  you've got honor killings in places like Somalia and Pakistan where people who look at a man
[48:02.480 --> 48:09.120]  twice are stoned to death killed by their own fathers that's global oppression of women
[48:09.120 --> 48:15.120]  a guy who writes a satirical blog no matter how offended you are by it that's not global
[48:15.120 --> 48:20.680]  oppression of women you can't equate that on the same level yet again this Stockholm
[48:20.680 --> 48:27.280]  syndrome continues meanwhile we have even more examples of migrant sex attacks just
[48:27.280 --> 48:34.720]  in cologne this was reported yesterday out of Breitbart the daughter of a prominent cologne
[48:34.720 --> 48:39.280]  musician was jumped by a gang who beat her in the face and tore off her clothes although
[48:39.280 --> 48:44.760]  there was a number of people other other people in close proximity to the attack non-responded
[48:44.760 --> 48:49.160]  to the 26 year old woman's cries for help worse when she managed to escape to a nearby
[48:49.160 --> 48:54.920]  bar for aid she was thrown out by the landlord who said he didn't want any trouble at the
[48:54.920 --> 49:01.040]  establishment police managed to apprehend one suspect who has been named only as usef
[49:01.040 --> 49:06.320]  b police will also be visiting the bar to investigate their failure to render assistance
[49:06.320 --> 49:12.320]  to the woman and that is out of German media so again another migrant raping a woman in
[49:12.320 --> 49:21.160]  cologne the people did not come to her aid this is out of Copenhagen Denmark Danish police
[49:21.160 --> 49:26.000]  withheld fact that Islamist government was carrying gold plated Karen you remember there
[49:26.000 --> 49:33.440]  was an incident back in February last year where a Danish freedom of speech convention
[49:33.440 --> 49:39.960]  took place and it was attacked by this Islamist gunman again shortly after Charlie head though
[49:39.960 --> 49:46.160]  Breitbart reports Pakistani origin Omar el-Hussain pumped 30 rounds in a Danish freedom of speech
[49:46.160 --> 49:51.360]  convention and the synagogue in February last year was carrying a gold illuminated
[49:51.360 --> 49:56.360]  Quran at the time of his death police examination of his corpse after he was shot and killed
[49:56.360 --> 50:01.080]  by police officers found the bookmark to be placed a passage dealing with the treatment
[50:01.080 --> 50:09.120]  of disbelievers and worshippers of idols so again this proponent of the religion of
[50:09.120 --> 50:16.200]  peace went to shoot up this freedom of speech convention targeted people for death based
[50:16.200 --> 50:21.520]  on a Quranic passage that talks about the treatment of disbelievers which of course
[50:21.520 --> 50:28.960]  orders direct Muslims to kill disbelievers just as the prophet Mohammed did the police
[50:28.960 --> 50:35.280]  covered this up for over a year the fact that he had a Quran on his person at the time of
[50:35.280 --> 50:41.080]  the shooting which directed him to carry out the shooting in the name of killing the disbelievers
[50:41.080 --> 50:46.120]  why have they covered that up for a year unless it's for the same reason that German the Swedish
[50:46.120 --> 50:50.920]  police are covering up these mass migrant rape attacks we'll get more into it after

[57:01.560 --> 57:08.080]  crucial for you to support us by getting the products at info wars life dot com now we've
[57:08.080 --> 57:13.960]  seen the treatment of women who are raped in cologne I just read the story about how
[57:13.960 --> 57:19.920]  she was pleading for help from Germans they ignored her well different situation in Russia
[57:19.920 --> 57:26.440]  this is at the daily caller refugees go clubbing in Russia harass girls wake up in hospital
[57:26.440 --> 57:31.560]  the next morning a group of 51 refugees were brutally assaulted outside a nightclub in
[57:31.560 --> 57:38.400]  mermansk Russia after they grow up to molester women at a nightclub on Saturday the refugees
[57:38.400 --> 57:44.080]  have previously been ordered to leave Norway for quote bad behavior wonder what that was
[57:44.080 --> 57:48.920]  and tried their luck in Russia what they didn't realize when they went out clubbing in mermansk
[57:48.920 --> 57:54.760]  is that Russians have less tolerance when it comes to sexual assault on local women than
[57:54.760 --> 58:01.920]  other European countries now the Russians didn't hand out roses to the migrant rapists
[58:01.920 --> 58:08.120]  they handed out beat downs and then the police showed up and dished out some of their own
[58:08.120 --> 58:13.360]  instant justice if you know what I mean not that I'm condoning that but you compare it
[58:13.360 --> 58:19.520]  to how police totally stood down in cologne left these women completely defenseless during
[58:19.520 --> 58:24.880]  a civil war style scenario they had to run to bouncers in nearby hotels to try and get
[58:24.880 --> 58:32.080]  protection hundreds of them molested beat and robbed didn't happen in Russia a different
[58:32.080 --> 58:37.200]  outcome in that case we'll be back with the second hour of the Alex Jones show after breaking

[01:00:34.920 --> 01:00:42.160]  Tommy Robinson who is one of the leading spokesman for Pegida UK of course he has a panic button
[01:00:42.160 --> 01:00:47.800]  because the threat of him being attacked by Islamists is so severe that he basically has
[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:53.000]  to have this 24 hour panic button again the religion of peace you know it's all about
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:58.040]  peace and love he did an interview now this is interesting we'll go to the clip in a second
[01:00:58.040 --> 01:01:04.160]  with Al Jazeera they were asking him about Islam about the Quran about the Prophet Muhammad
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:12.160]  he laid down some home truths about Muhammad they cut out 50 seconds of his interview during
[01:01:12.160 --> 01:01:18.640]  the broadcast of this program it hasn't reared it won't reared and for very good reason this
[01:01:18.640 --> 01:01:24.760]  is a shocking example of media censorship when it comes to Islam let's go to the clip
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:34.760]  now
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:41.200]  where you are in Doha to criticize the Prophet Muhammad yes I have had intelligent conversations
[01:01:41.200 --> 01:01:45.800]  with my Islamic colleagues on the very same subject so you know of the life of Muhammad
[01:01:45.800 --> 01:01:56.080]  yes you know that he murdered 600 people you know that he raped you know yes no no people
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:02:00.040]  in the Bible is very different to people in the Bible and the messenger of God who is
[01:02:00.040 --> 01:02:03.720]  the most moral compass for every Muslim in the world and when he is the moral compass
[01:02:03.720 --> 01:02:07.000]  for every Muslim in the world and he married a six year old child called Aisha and he raped
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.480]  her when she was nine I have a problem with that and when people wish to live as Muhammad
[01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:20.000]  did in my country well you are you are no no the country you are sitting in now people
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.760]  from Israel are not even allowed to enter so if we want to talk about fascism the country
[01:02:23.760 --> 01:02:33.840]  you are in now people with Israeli passports but okay is that untrue can someone in Qatar
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:39.680]  leave Islam yes it is supposed to be punishable you don't have to be Islamic to be in Qatar
[01:02:39.680 --> 01:02:45.600]  you can leave the country you can come into the country if you are a Muslim a Muslim cannot
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:49.880]  leave Islam is punishable in Qatar the country that you are talking to me from the country
[01:02:49.880 --> 01:02:53.800]  whose tower I am sitting in the country that funds radicalization worldwide the country
[01:02:53.800 --> 01:02:57.640]  that supports Hamas and you are sitting there trying to take some moral high ground about
[01:02:57.640 --> 01:03:01.880]  issues in the world relate to Islamic extremism when the country and the people who are paying
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:06.600]  your wage are propagating that extremism worldwide I have come into this building and just had
[01:03:06.600 --> 01:03:10.520]  to go through an airport-style scanner and when I asked why they said because of the
[01:03:10.520 --> 01:03:15.320]  Paris attacks Tommy I do have to move the debate on because I do have to move the debate
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:20.000]  on yes of course I do because otherwise you and I will end up having no no that's not
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:23.520]  true sir otherwise you and I will have to tell you the truth you and I will have to have
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:28.200]  a conversation down the pub the next time I'm back in London now what you heard there
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:33.960]  was Tommy Robinson appearing on Al Jazeera for a debate about Islam you'll notice there
[01:03:33.960 --> 01:03:40.680]  shortly into the clip which we just played the audio changed that was just Tommy speaking
[01:03:40.680 --> 01:03:46.360]  because he was recording the interview at the same time via a camera situated right next
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:51.000]  to him where he was sitting and it turned out for very good purpose because when they
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:57.960]  actually aired the broadcast of this debate they excised those 50 seconds out of the interview
[01:03:57.960 --> 01:04:04.200]  where he's talking about the Prophet Muhammad marrying a six-year-old girl raping a nine-year-old
[01:04:04.200 --> 01:04:09.880]  girl they don't want their Islamic audience in Qatar to hear that that's banned that's
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:16.040]  censored they cut it out of the interview and later an Al Jazeera spokesman told Breitbart
[01:04:16.040 --> 01:04:20.360]  inside stories a pre-recorded program and on many occasions our editorial staff make
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:27.240]  decisions on what to include or omit based on what is editorially relevant and acceptable
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:33.560]  to broadcasting standards so they couldn't let that snippet go out on air again another example
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:39.720]  of media censorship when it comes to Islam we have the top former CEO of ZDF in Germany saying
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:45.560]  the government tells us what to report they say we can't say anything negative about the quote
[01:04:45.560 --> 01:04:52.440]  refugees this is a huge media cover-up and it continues to intensify Alex Jones coming up
[01:04:52.440 --> 01:04:58.040]  after the break stay tuned this is the Alex Jones show live infowalls.com don't go away
[01:04:59.080 --> 01:05:03.880]  a pro abortion group is attacking a Doritos Super Bowl ad for humanizing baby fetuses
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:08.040]  in the ad a pregnant woman is getting an ultrasound while a man besides her realizes the
[01:05:08.040 --> 01:05:12.120]  unborn baby will move in the direction of the Doritos he's snacking on the man poised with
[01:05:12.120 --> 01:05:15.720]  the baby attempting in vain to reach the chips from the womb until the mother throws the Doritos
[01:05:15.720 --> 01:05:20.200]  across the room which prompts the child to launch itself outside mom and towards the chips in response
[01:05:20.200 --> 01:05:25.400]  to national abortion reproductive rights action league said the ad used an anti-choice tactic of
[01:05:25.400 --> 01:05:29.720]  humanizing fetuses the statement underscores how neural and similar groups to humanize the
[01:05:29.720 --> 01:05:34.040]  unborn in a vain attempt to justify abortions especially in the aftermath of the Planned
[01:05:34.040 --> 01:05:37.960]  Parenthood sting videos exposing its officials admitting they sell aborted baby organs for
[01:05:37.960 --> 01:05:43.400]  profit. Narl however didn't stop there the group also called out a Snickers ad for being transphobic
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:48.120]  and a Hyundai ad for showing a dad take away his daughter's autonomy this is all part of the political
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:52.920]  correctness campaign spearheaded by the authoritarian left to not only control free speech but also
[01:05:52.920 --> 01:05:59.320]  how people think. This is Kit Daniels with infoworse.com reporting. Over the years there

[01:07:57.640 --> 01:08:08.120]  from his central texas command center deep behind enemy lines the information war continues
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:11.240]  it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:28.840]  we are back the alex jones show we're gonna have alex jones popping in when he's ready
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:34.520]  but again going back to this migrant crisis news which continues to explode this is out of
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:42.440]  gateway pundit sweden isis flag and praetor alla threat painted on school wall swedish officials
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:46.760]  found isis graffiti on the wall of a school this week and you can go through the article and look
[01:08:46.760 --> 01:08:55.000]  at the picture it's a direct representation of the isis flag and it reads praetor alla or die
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:01.640]  this is painted on the side of a school in sweden which of course is the center of tolerance and
[01:09:01.640 --> 01:09:06.760]  multiculturalism bright bought reported what appears to be an islamic state battle flag has
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:11.400]  been painted on the wall of the school along with the words praetor alla or die reports sweden
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:16.760]  state radio police were called when the graffiti was discovered but at present they have no suspects
[01:09:16.760 --> 01:09:22.120]  for the crime admits a spokesman the headmistress of the school told media the sign made her feel
[01:09:22.120 --> 01:09:28.200]  quote uncomfortable imagine if you you were taking your kids to school and you saw this
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:33.160]  paint on the side of the wall and we've seen banners in germany which say similar things you
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:39.000]  know hung on overpasses praetor alla or die in fact i believe it said virtually the same thing
[01:09:39.720 --> 01:09:47.160]  we've seen signs being carried by migrants at the macedonian border saying open the border or die
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:53.320]  these are very peaceful people that were allowing into europe and again as i mentioned before the
[01:09:53.320 --> 01:10:00.200]  break we've not only seen a government censorship of crimes involving these migrants and who knows
[01:10:00.200 --> 01:10:05.800]  how many are occurring that don't get reported the ones that are getting reported are overwhelming
[01:10:05.800 --> 01:10:13.240]  as it is but now we've got al jazeera tommy robinson goes on there to do an interview a debate
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:19.560]  they cut out 50 seconds of the debate because they don't want their listeners their viewers
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:26.200]  is hearing that the prophet muhammad married a six-year-old girl and then raped her when she was
[01:10:26.200 --> 01:10:33.160]  nine years old which is in the quran the same one that they read the same one that directs them
[01:10:33.160 --> 01:10:40.120]  but they can't have their viewers see that and hear that they cut out 50 seconds but luckily
[01:10:40.840 --> 01:10:46.840]  robinson was recording the interview live he was periscoping it at the same time so he has
[01:10:46.840 --> 01:10:53.160]  the segment that they cut out somebody put it into a video show where it was cut out and yet
[01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:59.080]  again another media censorship scandal when it comes to this migrant crisis as i mentioned before
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:05.960]  the break the former head of zdf which is the top broadcaster in germany came out last week and
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:12.920]  basically said we're told what to report and what not to report by the german government this is a
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:20.520]  supposedly independent media outlet and they report on things that will quote please mrs merkel
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:28.840]  they also don't report on anything negative about the migrant crisis we've seen similar things
[01:11:29.480 --> 01:11:35.000]  you know with other news agencies throughout europe we've also seen a police cover up this is out
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:42.280]  of info wars dot com just last week code 291 swedish police cover up thousands of crimes involving
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:47.960]  refugees swedish police have covered up thousands of crimes involving migrants over the past four
[01:11:47.960 --> 01:11:54.520]  months all of which have been classified under a secret 291 refugee coke designation it has been
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:12:01.800]  revealed according to a report in swedish newspaper spenska spenska dagblatt around five thousand
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:08.680]  incidents have been kept secret including 559 cases of violence 194 assaults two terror threats
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:14.840]  and four rapes the article explains that the incidents have been covered up because of a
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:20.520]  directive from the national operational department that any information pertaining to the behavior
[01:12:20.520 --> 01:12:29.640]  of refugees be censored and again it comes back to this justifying this kind of criminal behavior
[01:12:29.640 --> 01:12:34.360]  based on the fact that they're traumatized even though many of them are just fleeing to europe
[01:12:34.360 --> 01:12:40.120]  to get benefits they're not fleeing from war zones official sources blame the violence on quote
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:45.960]  traumatized people being kept in overcrowded places with no way commander thomas wallberg
[01:12:45.960 --> 01:12:50.760]  adding that it was sad the information wasn't made available to the public he also told the
[01:12:50.760 --> 01:12:55.560]  newspaper that there were even more incidents than the swedish newspaper has not been given
[01:12:55.560 --> 01:13:03.880]  access to so we also have a similar situation in finland the police were ordered by the country's
[01:13:03.880 --> 01:13:09.320]  national police board not to publicly identify migrants as criminal suspects of the concerns
[01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:15.400]  that doing so would encourage a racist backlash against the wave of asylum seekers entering
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:22.200]  scandinavia so in germany where there was a rape in the town of debt mold back a few months ago
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:27.480]  they covered up that incident because they didn't want to legitimize critics of mass migration
[01:13:27.480 --> 01:13:34.520]  we see in finland we see in sweden they've orchestrated a giant cover-up because they
[01:13:34.520 --> 01:13:41.080]  don't want to build that resentment which will cause civil unrest they don't want to change the
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:47.400]  policy so they're hiding these migrant crimes these sex attacks even in the very first few hours
[01:13:47.400 --> 01:13:53.320]  after the new year's day mass mobilization in cologne the cologne police decided and the
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:58.440]  police chief was actually fired partly as a result of this to cover up information about
[01:13:58.440 --> 01:14:05.320]  that incident you had police describing it as a civil war-like situation hundreds of women being
[01:14:05.320 --> 01:14:12.920]  surrounded, groped, smacked they had their items stole from them you had people running to nearby
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:20.280]  hotels to flee to try and get protection from bouncers because the police were extremely
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:25.960]  light on the ground reinforcements sufficient reinforcements never arrived so you had panic
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:31.400]  everywhere you had hysteria everywhere what did the cologne police come out and say the next day
[01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:37.800]  in a press release they said it was a completely peaceful night passed off without incident at
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:44.120]  the very same time as people in germany were on social media describing this mass attack
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:51.240]  it was a police cover-up it was a media cover-up the german media didn't report on it for three
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:57.720]  days afterwards despite being bombarded with these personal stories from all the victims who were
[01:14:57.720 --> 01:15:04.120]  there we saw a similar situation in sweden there was a pop concert in stock home last summer similar
[01:15:04.120 --> 01:15:10.600]  thing happened muslim migrants mass molesting young women the police decided to cover it up
[01:15:10.600 --> 01:15:15.880]  because they didn't want to make the migrants look bad and that's exactly what i'm hearing from
[01:15:15.880 --> 01:15:22.520]  private sources where you have volunteers in these migrant camps in sweden young women you know
[01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:29.720]  open borders enthusiasts who are being raped by the muslim migrants they don't report on the
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:35.720]  rape because in this case this one individual said oh my dad was an immigrant from the balkans
[01:15:35.720 --> 01:15:43.640]  i don't want to make the migrants look bad so she didn't even report to the police that's why
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:48.600]  only some of this information is coming to light imagine if all of it was coming to light
[01:15:48.600 --> 01:15:53.800]  imagine if there wasn't a huge media cover-up and deception surrounding this it would be 10 times
[01:15:53.800 --> 01:16:00.280]  worse we got alex jones on the line alex welcome to the show oh thank you my friend i'm unable to
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:06.520]  connect you via audio skype for some reason what am i coming to you via cell yeah loud and clear
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:14.280]  okay because i'm down here investigating the us mexican border and breaking news on that when
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:23.560]  i return the next few days it is amazing that you can literally fly in to dallas to jfa in new york
[01:16:23.560 --> 01:16:31.080]  to los angeles california if you're coming in on flights and they are not even looking at the
[01:16:31.640 --> 01:16:36.760]  passports or ids we see the stories out of kfk and other airports where they quote claim it's a
[01:16:36.760 --> 01:16:41.880]  glitch and they just let everybody through no those are direct stand-down orders and again
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:48.440]  i am not demonizing the poor people the third world that want to come here if i live in guamala
[01:16:48.440 --> 01:16:58.040]  or nicaragua uh or el salvador or niteria uh or uh romania or thailand for that matter i would want
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:03.800]  to come here but at the same time it shows how the entire claim that they're taking our liberties
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:09.880]  and developing our temples and driving everything we buy to keep us safe is an abject and complete
[01:17:10.440 --> 01:17:17.080]  110 fraud and the whole national security apparatus is not to keep us safe but to enslave
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:22.600]  us now that's the globalist on top it does nothing just to blame the local government themselves
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:27.240]  that are being taken over as if they're the ones that are doing it we have to take those local
[01:17:27.240 --> 01:17:34.360]  governments back to restore our republic in this larger fight pole but i've got so much to go over
[01:17:34.360 --> 01:17:42.680]  here in the next hour with you joe biggs one of our reporters will be joining us for about 40
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:47.960]  after as well he came to come into the office at least when i talked to him two hours ago
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:54.520]  because he's dizzy uh his his his neck has hurt and he has shrapnel in his neck and his chest
[01:17:54.520 --> 01:18:00.680]  and basically all of his body from two different shrapnel incidents directly on the stand uh but
[01:18:00.680 --> 01:18:07.400]  last night just to be in to show it's indicative of this culture what's indicative of this society
[01:18:07.400 --> 01:18:12.760]  uh he was getting home and her dinner with a girlfriend and they were going to his apartment
[01:18:13.480 --> 01:18:20.200]  and this woman copped in a fake police car pulls up i see him everywhere now that last thing on
[01:18:20.200 --> 01:18:24.680]  security guards are bad but this guy was he jumps out in his video of this we can't play it's all
[01:18:24.680 --> 01:18:30.840]  the cuss words and he starts following him up to the apartment he says you know what are you doing
[01:18:30.840 --> 01:18:35.240]  who are you and it feels as if i live right here they got swollen picture there for safety and then
[01:18:35.240 --> 01:18:39.720]  he just says okay we're here i'm fine and the guy reportedly according to joe ramson's head
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:45.640]  in the wall from behind tackles him against choking and joe doesn't want to resist you but
[01:18:45.640 --> 01:18:50.280]  president whatever the set of this he could even tell the guy was a cop or went to cop with fake
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:57.080]  coffee he thought it was fake and then they got her pepper spray and the apd gets there and says okay
[01:18:57.080 --> 01:19:01.640]  we'll not take anybody to jail obviously chill biggs is the only thing but but this just shows
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:09.080]  how our borders are wide open but in austin texas some weird product security guy just pops out of
[01:19:09.080 --> 01:19:14.600]  the middle of nowhere and and and uh according to joe biggs and his girlfriend who has video of it
[01:19:14.600 --> 01:19:23.640]  assault him and and this just shows this this ongoing time bomb situation that we're facing
[01:19:23.640 --> 01:19:29.400]  but when we come back from break we're going to get into what happened in the big debates this

[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:38.600]  would crash they did those who listened had a chance to save themselves but this has nothing to do

[01:25:33.400 --> 01:25:38.680]  in a bunch of patrolling operations really breaking all that down today this is a short
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:47.160]  segment long segment coming up uh watching the debates saturday night and looking at what happened
[01:25:47.160 --> 01:25:54.600]  they build this as the end of trump they build this as you know his star had fallen his luster
[01:25:54.600 --> 01:26:00.520]  was gone the sparkle it's twinkle hood at them regardless again if we folks think trump is
[01:26:00.520 --> 01:26:06.040]  essentially don't like as well he is the populist ball carrier right now and that's why the
[01:26:06.040 --> 01:26:10.840]  establishment both parties the globalist billerberg group are against him and he comes out with
[01:26:10.840 --> 01:26:14.760]  these waterboarding statements to sound tough on it pretty with him but the point is the
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:18.920]  waterboard is going on regardless the point is he wants to sound tough for the public let's get
[01:26:18.920 --> 01:26:25.240]  passed on from why isn't the system so scared of him why is the system trying to shut him down
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:29.960]  and despite everything they threw against him and obviously manipulated things within
[01:26:29.960 --> 01:26:39.240]  Carson theft and polls in in in Iowa trump turbo searches from between 17 and 18 points to 21 22
[01:26:39.240 --> 01:26:45.720]  points 25 points in some scientific polls paul watson what was trump really signified you you
[01:26:45.720 --> 01:26:52.200]  got the same take away as i do or what would you augment that of the disagree well obviously he's
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:56.920]  got a lot of views which i disagree with torture being one of them it's completely useless doesn't
[01:26:56.920 --> 01:27:03.240]  work there are some other issues on surveillance i don't agree with him on but the establishment
[01:27:03.240 --> 01:27:07.880]  has created donald trump they left the vacuum in which he entered and that's why they're so
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:13.400]  terrified of him his self-funded he's a loose cannon they don't have control of him so whether
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:19.240]  you agree with his politics or not like bernie sanders probably to a lesser degree than trump
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:25.320]  but they don't control him either which is now we've even got a discussion of the elite being
[01:27:25.320 --> 01:27:31.000]  panicked and terrified about bernie sanders because now he's narrowed that gap to hillary clinton
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:36.200]  we got a new national poll out today saying basically their neck and neck from hillary being
[01:27:36.200 --> 01:27:42.360]  two to one ahead of him just a few months ago he's already caught up and they're terrified of that
[01:27:42.360 --> 01:27:48.360]  because we knew back from bill deberg when we got our sources that hillary was definitely the pick
[01:27:48.360 --> 01:27:55.480]  she took the fall for obama back in 2008 now it's her turn but again no one's buying into this and
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:00.920]  then you've got madeline albright saying that young women should vote for hillary or they're
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:07.400]  going to go to hell basically so her sole platform is that she's female that's all she's got she
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:13.560]  doesn't have the platform and that's beginning to fail the worry i've got with trump is they've
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:19.640]  tried so hard to demonize him demonize his character over and over again that's failed could they go
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:24.360]  to hell you just you just touched it again perfectly he is touching the zygote this can
[01:28:24.360 --> 01:28:30.200]  fill the vacuum when they ran those political corpses when they ran those political graveyards
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:39.800]  when they arrogantly gibberish includes the filled uh flotilla a fraud push a jeb bush
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:47.640]  and hillary clinton is supposedly the presumptive nominees they jump the collective titan and
[01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:52.520]  that's what trump now is we're titans in greek mythology and we're not saying titans are real
[01:28:52.520 --> 01:28:57.400]  it's an allegory for the dark times if they think i'm being serious it's an allegory it's a
[01:28:57.400 --> 01:29:04.200]  it's a parable it's it's an analogy titans came before the gods and the titans didn't care they
[01:29:04.200 --> 01:29:10.200]  were forces of nature and so the fact that the gods were so arrogant that god created such
[01:29:10.200 --> 01:29:16.840]  destructive uh anti-prosperity has opened the door now for the titan and that is donald trump
[01:29:16.840 --> 01:29:24.360]  the prophet to be released out of his undersea lair uh by the god of the sea now hillary is the
[01:29:24.360 --> 01:29:31.320]  gorgon or is the snake headed woman madusa can she defeat the titan is the greatest question
[01:29:31.320 --> 01:29:39.720]  or will donald trump not look in her eyes well that is the question and the geop establishment
[01:29:39.720 --> 01:29:44.760]  have got a new talking point even though trumps obviously set to win new hampshire they're now
[01:29:44.760 --> 01:29:53.160]  saying if trump only wins by 12 points he was on the march the empires on the run alex jones and the

[01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:08.040]  veteran glp strategist roger stone he said quote trump must return to the core issues that put him

[01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:23.560]  trump should talk about the trump tax plan praised by supply side guru larry kudrow we know trump is
[01:30:23.560 --> 01:30:29.240]  very very rich we want to hear how he would make us rich stone continues stating the rise of rubio
[01:30:29.240 --> 01:30:34.200]  is very real but trump must dispatch cruises a viable candidate before he can face off with rubio
[01:30:34.200 --> 01:30:38.360]  who will continue to be a factor in the palomado state but rubio may have already taken himself
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:43.080]  down considering his robotic performance during saturday's debate in which he used the same memorized
[01:30:43.080 --> 01:30:47.960]  line at least eight times showing he's a pre-programmed establishment candidate who can't speak off

[01:33:49.480 --> 01:33:53.160]  uh two weeks ago on the album came down there my cousin buckling so the crusade you have is
[01:33:53.160 --> 01:33:59.080]  the megadeth i'll be expanded they must hang obviously metallic as well to heal great sound
[01:33:59.080 --> 01:34:04.840]  for it but this megadeth i'm so busy i'm like yeah it really is an album about business doing stuff
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:11.320]  and i finally downloaded saturday and i tell you absolutely amazing day about a year and a half
[01:34:11.320 --> 01:34:15.640]  ago it asked me to work with them writing some of the new songs for this next album i told the
[01:34:15.640 --> 01:34:19.960]  brother you're smarter than i am about this kind of stuff you write your own songs you're the guy that
[01:34:19.960 --> 01:34:26.680]  wrote uh you know the the first song to kill them all the four horsemen walk of your wife and
[01:34:26.680 --> 01:34:31.320]  children now it's time to wield the blade so i said i think you can write your new album but i tell
[01:34:31.320 --> 01:34:35.560]  you uh here's the album he is probably one of the best megadeth albums ever i think it's about like
[01:34:35.560 --> 01:34:42.040]  14 or 15 albums he's not a sponsor the folks should support uh great musicians like they must
[01:34:42.040 --> 01:34:46.360]  gain that they're exposed if they will order and retract listen the whole thing on the new album
[01:34:47.080 --> 01:34:51.800]  it's excellent it exposes the whole globalist agenda in fact that piece you just heard the
[01:34:51.800 --> 01:34:57.800]  intro two years the threat is real and sort of saying two years ago isis threat is real the
[01:34:57.800 --> 01:35:02.600]  al-qaeda threat was manufactured the real threat that it was it was given power manufacturer isis
[01:35:02.600 --> 01:35:09.080]  is much much bigger than isis told us last february a year ago actually a year ago this weekend uh
[01:35:09.080 --> 01:35:12.920]  saturday was the year anniversary they thought oppressor was staying we're going to flood europe
[01:35:12.920 --> 01:35:18.120]  with millions of uh migrants we're going to get you a terror attack and then our own government
[01:35:18.120 --> 01:35:23.560]  open the borders up to bring them in you ask why because once they attack they'll then announce
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:31.160]  oh we're banning germans and french and and and u k citizens right to criticize these people
[01:35:31.160 --> 01:35:36.520]  we're taking your free speech away to protect you for uh so the terrorists don't attack you
[01:35:36.520 --> 01:35:43.560]  this is the alliance of the left of globalist and peter southerland at the u.m and the spottings
[01:35:43.560 --> 01:35:49.000]  and the radical johannes and so let's get all this aside we know the u.m's that we know
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:52.520]  Hillary Clinton's that we know madeline all right that's probably that clip all mentioned
[01:35:52.520 --> 01:35:57.560]  to this article which says yeah 500,000 kids is a good price to pay for peace well just kill
[01:35:57.560 --> 01:36:03.240]  500,000 innocent iranian children who did this on 9-11 with the bobby's head madeline did that
[01:36:03.240 --> 01:36:12.360]  keep it safe no in fact 15 years of 9-11 25 years after her wars in iraq all these decades later
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:19.160]  now there's a 300,000 army running around murdering christians and non-radical muslims and oh who
[01:36:19.160 --> 01:36:26.040]  does it take talking points from madeline olbright hillary clinton's the man's the powers and
[01:36:26.040 --> 01:36:30.360]  remember the serbs and i'm not lionizing serbs but i was with the numbers but he was next to
[01:36:30.360 --> 01:36:36.360]  serbs killed half the people the croats and muslims did the serbs under pito stabilized the whole area
[01:36:36.360 --> 01:36:42.040]  that didn't persecute people compared to the muslims and then the the the croats and the muslims
[01:36:42.040 --> 01:36:48.840]  attacked them they fought back and not once but twice d.u. bottom for drops all over the area
[01:36:48.840 --> 01:36:53.640]  they brought iranical jihadists all iranian funded them and they took one third of serbian
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:59.960]  i feel like they can catch the police diana mrs jim florida georgia alabama all the way
[01:36:59.960 --> 01:37:07.480]  through tinnessee to opaloma and giving it to a foreign government and then claiming war crimes
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:11.960]  and all this if you want to know what they want to do to america and europe it's what the global
[01:37:11.960 --> 01:37:19.080] ists did giving the muslims the muslims have on average seven kids the muslims know how to put a
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:24.920]  woman in a cage they know how to public execute they know how to censor and the big man of angst
[01:37:24.920 --> 01:37:29.560]  are in love with it they're in love with it i love that schiky nick biddy gosh all the police
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:36.120]  don't want to work dot com all you want play it through that cia offshore globalist anti-american
[01:37:36.120 --> 01:37:43.000]  rich gloria steinem of the central intelligence agency and she's sitting there and and and and
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:47.480]  bill margo's why don't you criticize radical muslims she feels christians are the problems
[01:37:47.480 --> 01:37:53.080]  christians all you know no no muslims it's diverted and changing the subject in a classic
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:59.240]  talking point these people are in them so again i was against the stabilizing iraq syria libya
[01:37:59.240 --> 01:38:04.280]  those were the non radical countries compared to the others i was against them people said
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:09.400]  well why are you now all against those in borders because now that we failed to stop the class of
[01:38:09.400 --> 01:38:15.880]  civilization now that we fail to stop that phase the globalist plan now those bulkheads those firewalls
[01:38:15.880 --> 01:38:20.920]  were blown wide open now we've got to stop the class that they want to have at the next level
[01:38:20.920 --> 01:38:25.400]  and they're bringing in the sleeper team zalcata admits the safety has been in on friday they got
[01:38:25.400 --> 01:38:31.400]  sleeper teams in every major state every major eam country every major uk town and when they start
[01:38:31.400 --> 01:38:36.600]  blowing stuff up the media is going to say it's paul joseph watching the criticize of the cost
[01:38:36.600 --> 01:38:42.840]  that it's alex jones that caused it the home from span from the uk michael savages band
[01:38:42.840 --> 01:38:48.600]  oh my gosh it's your fault and then and then and then the left trained to submit trained to grovel
[01:38:48.600 --> 01:38:53.800]  and the libertarians in the service trained to submit as well we will all kneel and bow
[01:38:53.800 --> 01:39:00.520]  to the socialist globalist arbiters the referees who will tell us how the calendar cabbage and how
[01:39:00.520 --> 01:39:06.280]  we submit to be safe and they will use the jihad threat in every town and city under their controls
[01:39:06.280 --> 01:39:11.560]  it's like it is disguising to min us after the total submission this is their master plan
[01:39:11.560 --> 01:39:17.320]  wrote launch leering and demonic in our face and paul waspen i asked you what do we do about it
[01:39:19.240 --> 01:39:24.280]  well one of the things we can do is encourage governments and give money to allow you know
[01:39:24.280 --> 01:39:29.400]  syrian migrants to return to syria which many of the legitimate ones actually want to do
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:34.360]  so you pour money into the migrant camps that are already over there rather than allowing
[01:39:34.360 --> 01:39:39.880]  this mass wave of economic migrants who are not refugees again the vast majority of them according
[01:39:39.880 --> 01:39:46.360]  to un figures to come into the west because their culture is completely incompatible with us
[01:39:46.360 --> 01:39:51.960]  but you mentioned the left wing of course we had isis put out their manifesto a few months ago
[01:39:51.960 --> 01:39:57.880]  where they basically came out and said these left wingers these you know george soros types
[01:39:57.880 --> 01:40:03.320]  they align with our beliefs we basically believe the same thing at this point we need to co-opt
[01:40:03.320 --> 01:40:10.040]  them radicalize them arm them and now what do you see in places like cali you see these communists
[01:40:10.040 --> 01:40:17.320]  wave in hammer and sickles aiding the economic migrants attacking residents in cali enabling
[01:40:17.320 --> 01:40:22.680]  them helping them to storm ships you had a piggy march on saturday even when there's
[01:40:22.680 --> 01:40:27.880]  that even when the aid workers are scammed all the way they kneel and bow and worship their
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:34.840]  vapors because they hate their parents and prosperity so much there was a no borders activist
[01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:41.240]  in a migrant camp in france who was helping the migrants in that camp she was gang raped by sudenese
[01:40:41.240 --> 01:40:47.960]  migrants told to shut up about it by other left wingers because it would discredit their cause
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:53.160]  and these these are the people who would call themselves feminists ordering people to be silent
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:59.240]  censoring the rape of women because again it's not about protecting women it's not about principles
[01:40:59.240 --> 01:41:12.040]  it's about politics it's about this open world these are mental patients brainwashed by the schools
[01:41:12.040 --> 01:41:18.600]  these are jam jones cultists and there was a there was a journalist who went into the cali
[01:41:18.600 --> 01:41:26.440]  migrant camp to quote tell their story this extreme left winger he was knife attacked by these migrants
[01:41:26.440 --> 01:41:32.280]  his response was to blame the uk government for not allowing them into the country so again it's
[01:41:32.280 --> 01:41:36.760]  it's why i'm hearing over and over again from people who know we've got friends who are working
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:43.720]  in these migrant camps they say they're traumatized using that as a justification not to report these
[01:41:43.720 --> 01:41:50.360]  rapes to police there was another story told to me privately a few days ago a migrant stabbed his
[01:41:50.360 --> 01:41:56.600]  wife in the leg they called the doctor the doctor comes to the migrant camp this is in germany and
[01:41:56.600 --> 01:42:01.640]  all the migrants then start attacking the doctor and these kind of stories aren't even reaching the
[01:42:01.640 --> 01:42:06.920]  media we know the ones that are reaching the media are shocking enough we talked about the
[01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:12.680]  10-year-old boy being raped by an iraqi migrant in austria who thought it was so routine that he
[01:42:12.680 --> 01:42:18.200]  he didn't even try to flee this is the culture we're importing and the left is aiding it that's
[01:42:18.200 --> 01:42:23.640]  why we have the statistics we have the judge police the swedish police the jaren police caught
[01:42:23.640 --> 01:42:30.040]  and made sure news ordered to cover up the massive rape statistics because the left teaches in
[01:42:30.040 --> 01:42:37.240]  schools self loving self hating or your identity is hating yourself so when someone rakes your
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:43.800]  stabs a woman he does a beautiful thing because it's a german or it's a french woman in stabs
[01:42:43.800 --> 01:42:50.360]  she deserves it a 16-year-old a father with his young baby being given into icy water in stab
[01:42:50.360 --> 01:42:58.120]  he's a loving sacrament of the precious baby jihadi and the left smiles of the beauty of it
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:03.560]  because they've been taught their mental illness in their sheltered wealthy west to hate their mommy
[01:43:03.560 --> 01:43:11.000]  to hate his daddy to hate jesus to hate private property to hate prosperity and love the jihadi
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:16.280]  he's the oh had invaded syria and were busy murdering each other and this is the mental ill
[01:43:17.400 --> 01:43:22.680]  sick filth that we're dealing with this is this is who they are and a lot of liberal women as you
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:28.520]  know the new thing is having a jihadi and this is even in texas i've seen her about it it slaps
[01:43:28.520 --> 01:43:33.400]  you and knocks your teeth out there's nothing sexier but a jihadi because it's so fun to have
[01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:37.960]  to actually step on your head and and kick you in the gut now the man treats you good and what
[01:43:37.960 --> 01:43:43.320]  jesus is that but if it kicks you in the teeth and stomps on you it's liberal it's trendy you
[01:43:43.320 --> 01:43:47.480]  go smoke a hookah living and it's fun folks we're not joking we're putting mainstream
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:53.240]  news articles up while we're covering this to show you the suicide of the west the mass mental
[01:43:53.240 --> 01:44:01.000]  illness the brainwashing programming is taking place now here in a normal ring go to joe bagg uh

[01:46:06.280 --> 01:46:11.880]  to us what we went through and the rest of it but i'm going to do it right now and and there's audio
[01:46:11.880 --> 01:46:16.120]  this is going to be airing tomorrow because i was flying out of the country as part of an
[01:46:16.120 --> 01:46:21.160]  investigative report on the reporters being open and flying down to mexico to then travel up and
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:27.960]  basically assess what i see definitely here i'm flying out often i'm not against the ps a themselves
[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:32.760]  but the borders are wide open the government completes the struggling process plane loads
[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:38.360]  people flying at no i don't use the check it's total fraud they pull myself out they pull the
[01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:45.640]  camera person out they pull everybody out they sit there they go through everything and i start
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:49.400]  pointing out to the ps a hey you know the borders are open hanging you know we don't check people
[01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:54.360]  hang you know it's all security fear okay you know and they obviously agree with but here's the point
[01:46:55.240 --> 01:47:01.240]  as i said when i first got off this is all a giant fraud and then joe begs he was very close to the
[01:47:01.240 --> 01:47:05.240]  office last night was coming home with a girlfriend and he's going to come home with us right now
[01:47:06.920 --> 01:47:11.640]  and he i mean he called me earlier this morning said you hear what happened to me i said no about
[01:47:11.640 --> 01:47:17.880]  the country and he said yeah i i'm gonna let him tell the story but he's been very careful you know
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:22.120]  going over this because we're in front of action on this we've done this a lot they've been falsely
[01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:27.320]  arrested and imprisoned as well and uh Pittsburgh and want to uh let's say they settled but then on
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:32.920]  that's fine and we're not here to just be litigants we're just here to make sure tests are in his
[01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:38.440]  girlfriend to get down and go upstairs to the apartment and all of a sudden this uh one of
[01:47:38.440 --> 01:47:42.680]  the police cars these police cars driving on our police cars and i can barely tell the difference
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:48.280]  i'm going this police car pulls up the guy gets out and says where are you going? he says i live
[01:47:48.280 --> 01:47:53.000]  right here and i get to the space and he'll say i live here joe is press conservative
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  i'll talk to him he's wearing an army hat t-shirt jeans i'm not doing anything he says i'm going
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:04.040]  up to your apartment when they get up on that level by his apartment he goes okay man you can
[01:48:04.040 --> 01:48:09.800]  stop this now and he turns around and says his girlfriend let's start filming this and the guy
[01:48:09.800 --> 01:48:14.600]  rams his head in the wall go can correct the story of long though i'm getting out of here now
[01:48:14.600 --> 01:48:20.040]  rams his head in the wall cackles and starts choking and joe smart enough not to fight back
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:24.920]  is the one that you know the news saying is terrorist or something and then suddenly the
[01:48:24.920 --> 01:48:29.080]  guys are pepper spreading and the Austin cops get there the guy wants joe arrested the guy wants
[01:48:29.080 --> 01:48:34.680]  they don't arrest joe because they live here's girlfriend's video and it just shows how we've
[01:48:34.680 --> 01:48:39.480]  got checkpoints all over america everybody all paranoid but the borders open and the
[01:48:39.480 --> 01:48:44.440]  government shifts in whoever they want he's all of thought it's all training us to the stage
[01:48:44.440 --> 01:48:50.280]  i had a major collapse coming let's go to joe big i don't know if he's in studio he said his eyes
[01:48:50.280 --> 01:48:55.720]  were full shut and he's busy the guy's almost choked him out i mean just amazing self-control
[01:48:55.720 --> 01:49:01.000]  like that famous footage of the e n t and uncle homo and the cops are choking and letting them do
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:05.480]  it just putting up with it incredible self-control i don't even know at least but this thing when
[01:49:05.480 --> 01:49:11.480]  you choke somebody and say they're resisting is if that makes it okay it's insane so joe big correct
[01:49:11.480 --> 01:49:15.640]  my story if i'm wrong we can't really play the video because of the cuss words and things but
[01:49:15.640 --> 01:49:21.160]  explain exactly what happened to you on microcosm this whole situation yeah so i was out yesterday
[01:49:21.160 --> 01:49:26.360]  for the super bowl with my girlfriend and uh actually bumped into a buddy and he's telling me
[01:49:26.360 --> 01:49:31.400]  about how his daughter was murdered by his abusive or her abusive boyfriend he she was shot in the
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:36.920]  chest with a shotgun you know and we're drinking we're taking shots and you know i was tipsy last
[01:49:36.920 --> 01:49:43.400]  night you know uh we get back to the apartment and we're walking up the sidewalk and this guy's
[01:49:43.400 --> 01:49:47.640]  like hey man you know you guys need to you know be quiet you don't need to talk so loud and then
[01:49:47.640 --> 01:49:51.000]  he starts falling he's like do live here and i said yes i've lived there for two years like why
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:54.360]  doesn't matter he goes well you need to go up to your room and i was like well i'll go up there
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:50:01.320]  when i'm ready to go up there you know thank you he shines his light at me when i uh get ready
[01:50:01.320 --> 01:50:06.760]  start filming him to go live and then he grabs me from behind slams my head into a railing uh
[01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:11.480]  then jumps on my back and starts choking me you know and i'm sitting there like yelling you know
[01:50:11.480 --> 01:50:17.720]  trying to to yell as much as i can that i can't breathe and this guy's just got his arms around
[01:50:17.720 --> 01:50:21.720]  me the whole time is like stop you know stop resisting you know stop fighting me he's like
[01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:26.600]  i'm gonna pepper spray you and i'm sitting here being choked so i'm fighting to breathe i'm not
[01:50:26.600 --> 01:50:31.560]  fighting him you can see in the video i mean i'm clearly not a threatened any kind of way you know
[01:50:32.520 --> 01:50:37.400]  so they're sitting here he's strangling me and i'm yelling for help i'm telling Marissa to grab
[01:50:37.400 --> 01:50:42.680]  the phone to continue filming this entire event as it's unfolding and then the guy eventually
[01:50:42.680 --> 01:50:48.360]  ends up pepper spraying me like dumping the entire can into my face and my eye right here like my left
[01:50:48.360 --> 01:50:53.880]  eyes can barely even open up all the way it hurts so bad my head hurts because i got slamed into a
[01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:59.880]  metal guardrail you know and uh you know the the cops come neighbors are coming out everyone's
[01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:04.200]  trying to figure out what's going on and uh the cops just automatically come over put handcuffs on
[01:51:04.200 --> 01:51:09.400]  me and bring me away and separate us all and uh Marissa's filming and speaking to one of the
[01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:15.480]  officers uh from APD and uh you know this whole thing's going down and the cops are kind of like
[01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:20.600]  yeah you know what this this security guy is you know basically out of control he was not in the
[01:51:20.600 --> 01:51:27.720]  right he abuses power that he thinks he has his authority so such to say you know of a security
[01:51:27.720 --> 01:51:32.680]  guard whatever that is and uh you know the cops were on our side i didn't get arrested nothing you
[01:51:32.680 --> 01:51:37.880]  know on a record anything like that it was just an unfortunate event that really shows you what's
[01:51:37.880 --> 01:51:43.320]  going on out there the fact that this guy thought he could just throw me we're in the background
[01:51:43.320 --> 01:51:48.680]  without audio obviously with the cussing that's going on but why do you think this guy was so
[01:51:48.680 --> 01:51:55.160]  hands off and so upset i have no idea i mean you know we just had a letter posted on our door the
[01:51:55.160 --> 01:52:01.400]  other day saying to beware of uh you know there there'd been quite a few muggings and then uh
[01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:07.640]  Marissa's friend said that there's been a rapist out in this area you know where where i live so
[01:52:07.640 --> 01:52:12.120]  you know at this point in time there's people being mugged in our parking lot there's a rapist
[01:52:12.120 --> 01:52:16.520]  down the road you know that's you know it's been doing stuff so somebody pulled up in a security
[01:52:16.520 --> 01:52:21.240]  guard you know car and has on this fake badge you know i'm going to be a little skeptical of
[01:52:21.240 --> 01:52:26.120]  what's going on anybody could to grab something like that you know and put that on and and try to
[01:52:26.120 --> 01:52:30.440]  you know follow us and the fact that guy was trying to follow me upstairs in my room that's
[01:52:30.440 --> 01:52:35.560]  a little shady that's concerning like that's not his job to make sure i go into my place
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:41.640]  you know so that was out of control in that fact well we're going to investigate this
[01:52:41.640 --> 01:52:46.520]  Joe and i believe you and this guy this better be ready for us to take action because right now he
[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:51.080]  pushed around but it just shows this whole mentality of craziness where our borders wide open
[01:52:51.640 --> 01:52:57.240]  and they've got some guy running around you know doing this to you i'm just glad that you
[01:52:57.240 --> 01:53:02.280]  weren't hurt worse i'm glad you were cool the whole thing but uh you know watching the footage pretty
[01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:06.840]  extreme uh what happened i can see you're not resisting the guy uh you know just because he's
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:10.120]  wearing a rent a cop outfit there's some good security guards out there i get that there's
[01:53:10.120 --> 01:53:15.560]  also some crazy ones it's like there's some crazy cops and it just shows how security people police
[01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:22.200]  period after one uh these overzealous people out of there who really got something to prove uh and
[01:53:22.200 --> 01:53:26.200]  you know the fact that you said hey man could follow me it's cool doesn't mean he has to double down
[01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:32.920]  and show you who the boss is yeah and it's just totally disgusting so i just hope he's ready for
[01:53:32.920 --> 01:53:38.280]  the repercussions that uh you know we'll just see how he likes to begin politically but but shifting
[01:53:38.280 --> 01:53:44.280]  gears are the larger issue good the radicals are hottest open borders more plane loads coming in
[01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:49.160]  nothing being checked meanwhile the media demonizes trump it to me it's so exciting that they put
[01:53:49.160 --> 01:53:53.720]  everything against trump yet again it's full isle from the evidence silverwalden with the car
[01:53:53.720 --> 01:54:00.360]  similar feeling as though it's giving them to cruise uh cruise isn't freefall uh i'm not against
[01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:05.000]  cruise overall but man he's got these creepy computer systems he uses to track everybody
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:10.040]  and all the rest of it i mean i really think it's going to be between rubio and trump right now and
[01:54:10.040 --> 01:54:15.480]  rubio's and probel what is the system going to do joe begs what is the system going to do paul joseph
[01:54:15.480 --> 01:54:20.040]  wants it as everything they throw at trump only makes people get more behind him because let's just
[01:54:20.040 --> 01:54:23.960]  for the sake of argument say trump might not be a good guy i'm not saying that for the sake of
[01:54:23.960 --> 01:54:29.080]  argument okay fine the power structure we know is evil is against him what are they going to do
[01:54:29.080 --> 01:54:35.800]  to try to stop paul watson to pick yeah if i could jump in what they're trying to do right now elix
[01:54:35.800 --> 01:54:42.760]  is move the goalpost we've got this uh former governor john sununu a jeb bush supporter who
[01:54:42.760 --> 01:54:49.720]  basically went on fox news and said donald trump if donald trump only wins new hamcher by 12 points
[01:54:49.720 --> 01:54:55.480]  he actually loses this is what he said and we can play the clip later i think trump will win i don't
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:55:01.320]  think he'll win by as much as he thinks and as much as the polls say if he doesn't win by 12 points
[01:55:01.320 --> 01:55:07.480]  i think the perception will be that he lost so again you had it last week in uh iowa with him
[01:55:07.480 --> 01:55:12.680]  coming just behind crews with rubio surging rubio's dropped back again after his terrible debate
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:17.720]  performance but now they're reframing it to say even if trump wins if he doesn't win by whatever
[01:55:17.720 --> 01:55:22.760]  they say he should win by then he's a loser so that's how panicked they are now they're actually
[01:55:22.760 --> 01:55:28.200]  shifting the goalposts entirely this is like gladiator which is based on the composite of
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:33.000]  three real events that happens like the patriot is this is like gladiator one of the better films
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  uh but i'm not really scott where he can't be the general so he stabs him in the heart
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:44.120]  right before the left or a little bit but still the general beating and everybody sees that they
[01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:48.600]  are rigging the whole thing stabbing trump while he tied up and still promise picking their butt
[01:55:48.600 --> 01:55:52.920]  that's gotta scare him till they i mean you could see in the debate the other day uh i believe
[01:55:52.920 --> 01:55:58.040]  was saturday night i mean they had all these donors these establishment people inside there
[01:55:58.040 --> 01:56:03.720]  that were there to boo every time donald trump spoke they were there to attack him i mean normally
[01:56:03.720 --> 01:56:08.280]  when he's getting hand claps cheers and all that he was being booed by everyone in there and every
[01:56:08.280 --> 01:56:12.760]  time rubio said something they were clapping and screaming and yelling and happy every time rubio
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:19.400]  spoke so it's clearly it gives you a a picture as to what the establishment wants they are looking
[01:56:19.400 --> 01:56:23.160]  more and more at rubio and that looks like that's going to be the main god that they're going to
[01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:27.880]  try to push up and again i totally agree and that shows the downfall of the elite they don't get
[01:56:27.880 --> 01:56:33.480]  we're aware of the scam we see the staging that's what i'm saying we don't know who trump really is
[01:56:33.480 --> 01:56:39.640]  okay overall my guy tells me he's going to be good but let's get past that we know they're bad
[01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:44.440]  no they're rigging it don't they get all but the more they rig it the more they make him the people
[01:56:44.440 --> 01:56:51.560]  champion i think they're basically in panic mode right now they've they've used up their arsenal
[01:56:51.560 --> 01:56:56.440]  and they've got very little left this is why they're saying even if he wins he loses and you've
[01:56:56.440 --> 01:57:02.360]  got the same thing on the flip side with uh bernie sanders we've got a source out of dc whispers
[01:57:02.360 --> 01:57:08.280]  who says quote they have no idea what to do with sanders who of course i find his views completely
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:12.680]  horrendous but again he's a loose cannon that's the most terrifying thing to any
[01:57:12.680 --> 01:57:19.800]  establishment and how the elite is totally abordinated yeah and he goes on to say quote
[01:57:19.800 --> 01:57:24.040]  they don't want to offend and politically displace his supporters while at the same time knowing that
[01:57:24.040 --> 01:57:30.120]  if this thing continues to grow it will destroy the democrat party just like trump has destroyed
[01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:35.240]  this uh facade of the establishment republicans sanders is doing the same that's what they're
[01:57:35.240 --> 01:57:39.080]  terrified of they're terrified of this blazing the trade through independence
[01:57:39.880 --> 01:57:43.480]  now let's be clear most important thing i've said a long time listen up listen you know that's
[01:57:43.480 --> 01:57:48.840]  already this is all into the beginning of our victory patriots before us we before ron paul
[01:57:49.400 --> 01:57:54.680]  expose the globalist expose the program god demon i spot art we are in a position
[01:57:55.800 --> 01:58:00.120]  going into the globalist takeover they plan to have a globalist takeover with no one informed
[01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:05.160]  no one involved instead they're going to have a globalist takeover with most of the planet aware
[01:58:05.160 --> 01:58:12.600]  of their plans they're going to blow up in their face spectacularly like a endless crescendo of
[01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:20.040]  of a grand finale so folks get ready for an epic battle of incredible proportions and know that

[02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:55.800]  but but extending on this this is the epic battle for humanity right now so closing comments from
[02:01:55.800 --> 02:02:00.440]  begs and poll ops and we'll turn it back over to poll us i mean this is something that's happening
[02:02:00.440 --> 02:02:05.000]  all over the place i mean the the fact that i was able to actually get this on film which is
[02:02:05.000 --> 02:02:09.560]  going to you know save my butt if this guy to try to go ahead and sue first or something like that
[02:02:09.560 --> 02:02:13.640]  you know that's the kind of future that's happening you know there are people out there who are power
[02:02:13.640 --> 02:02:19.240]  hungry who are in positions or that they feel like they're in positions to to push people around and
[02:02:19.240 --> 02:02:23.800]  they abuse those authorities and people are there's police killings there's brutality there's all
[02:02:23.800 --> 02:02:28.360]  kinds of stuff going on and it turns out i happened to be fortunate this event nothing bad
[02:02:28.360 --> 02:02:32.600]  spiraled out of control uh too bad anyways i mean it's definitely bad what happened but
[02:02:32.600 --> 02:02:37.640]  it could have been worse and uh hopefully you know this footage will help you know kind of stop
[02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:41.640]  some of this stuff uh bring it to the forefront and uh get it back into a conversation
[02:02:45.400 --> 02:02:49.720]  yeah i mean i've seen the footage and i mean police are trained to de-escalate
[02:02:50.280 --> 02:02:55.640]  situations to prevent them from going violent and this guy engaged in the exact opposite he
[02:02:55.640 --> 02:03:01.400]  immediately escalated the situation and it's only going to end up turning out bad for him so again
[02:03:01.400 --> 02:03:06.760]  it's just when people get infused with this petty power they always abuse it and these kind of people
[02:03:06.760 --> 02:03:12.600]  exist in every sphere of society this is why we're seeing now a war on free speech from the
[02:03:12.600 --> 02:03:19.000]  perpetually offended because these are authoritarians who want to mess up other people's lives they're
[02:03:19.000 --> 02:03:25.160]  unhappy people they're not content with their own worthless existence so they have to interview with
[02:03:25.160 --> 02:03:29.400]  other people's lives to get their kids they have no power they want to make us give up our speech
[02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:33.000]  i agree if i think closing full i'd like to hear you have to break when you come back from about
[02:03:33.000 --> 02:03:40.280]  the classical liberals like john cleave and uh folks like jerry seinfeld saying the left is a
[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:46.120]  tyranny even though mark saying the left is a tyranny now they need to get it by design
[02:03:46.120 --> 02:03:51.080]  they need to understand it's an act of total domination it's not by accident but how do you
[02:03:51.080 --> 02:03:57.240]  think the new left the fortitarian left is going to dispatch the old left that doesn't want to live

[02:04:58.920 --> 02:05:03.800]  a pro abortion group is attacking a doritos super bowl ad for humanizing baby fetuses
[02:05:03.800 --> 02:05:07.960]  in the ad a pregnant woman is getting an ultrasound why man besides her realizes the
[02:05:07.960 --> 02:05:12.040]  unborn baby will move in the direction of the doritos he's snacking on the man toys with the
[02:05:12.040 --> 02:05:15.960]  baby attempting in vain to reach the chips from the womb until the mother throws the doritos across
[02:05:15.960 --> 02:05:20.120]  the room which prompts a child to launch itself outside mom and towards the chips in response
[02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:25.320]  to national abortion reproductive rights action league said the ad used an anti-choice tactic of
[02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:29.560]  humanizing fetuses the statement underscores how narall and similar groups to humanize the
[02:05:29.560 --> 02:05:33.960]  unborn in a vain attempt to justify abortions especially in the aftermath of the planned
[02:05:33.960 --> 02:05:37.880]  parenthood sting videos exposing its officials admitting they sell aborted baby organs for
[02:05:37.880 --> 02:05:43.320]  profit narall however didn't stop there the group also called out a snickers ad for being transphobic
[02:05:43.320 --> 02:05:47.560]  in a condi ad for showing a dad take away his daughter's autonomy this is all part of the
[02:05:47.560 --> 02:05:52.040]  political correctness campaign spearheaded by the authoritarian left to not only control free

[02:08:21.400 --> 02:08:24.360]  dot com studios it's alex jones
[02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:30.840]  you're watching alex jones show headline out of the american mirror which is up on the
[02:08:30.840 --> 02:08:38.760]  drug report video bill clinton accuses sanders supporters of sexism and increasingly gerry
[02:08:38.760 --> 02:08:43.880]  actor bill clinton is upping his attacks on the 74 year old socialist bernie sanders
[02:08:43.880 --> 02:08:50.920]  and is attempting to link anonymous internet trolls to hillary's rival basically bill clinton has
[02:08:50.920 --> 02:08:58.680]  got a print out of mean internet comments sexist misogynistic internet comments made against hillary
[02:08:58.680 --> 02:09:04.440]  clinton and is blaming them on bernie sanders supporters so we played the video earlier of
[02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:09.320]  madeline albright basically saying that all young women should vote for hillary all they're going
[02:09:09.320 --> 02:09:17.160]  to hell now bill clinton's got a list of mean internet comments calling out a sexism and again
[02:09:17.160 --> 02:09:22.840]  blaming it on bernie sanders so it goes back to this which we predicted from the very beginning
[02:09:22.840 --> 02:09:30.200]  hillary clinton's sole platform the only thing she's campaigning on is her gender and now bill
[02:09:30.200 --> 02:09:37.320]  clinton has jumped into the fray whining about mean internet comments david night your thoughts on
[02:09:37.320 --> 02:09:43.560]  hillary and this whole feminist stick that seems to be falling apart now yeah it's pretty amazing
[02:09:44.200 --> 02:09:49.880]  paul and of course we had hillary last week saying that cyber security was going to be one of the
[02:09:49.880 --> 02:09:54.200]  biggest challenges that we face in the future of course it's the biggest challenge that hillary
[02:09:54.200 --> 02:10:00.840]  faces right now because she put all of her emails on this private server and yet she has the audacity
[02:10:00.840 --> 02:10:06.840]  the hypocrisy to talk about cyber security being an issue and of course she thinks that she can
[02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:11.800]  solve it just by threatening foreign governments we're going to have to see if the system will
[02:10:11.800 --> 02:10:17.560]  the establishment will actually follow through on this national security religion that we've
[02:10:17.560 --> 02:10:22.200]  been fed the thing that's been used to take away every single one of our freedoms and if they're
[02:10:22.200 --> 02:10:27.560]  going to let hillary clinton pass we need to really push back on that course there's a talk
[02:10:27.560 --> 02:10:32.920]  now we see an article on it on a drudge report talking about how people are calling for loretta
[02:10:32.920 --> 02:10:36.680]  lynch to step aside because they don't believe that she's going to do anything to punish hillary
[02:10:36.680 --> 02:10:43.960]  clinton now we had rubio of course came third in a or many people were surprised with that many
[02:10:43.960 --> 02:10:49.640]  people pointed to microsoft being involved in counting the votes and their close ties with rubio
[02:10:49.640 --> 02:10:57.240]  so basically a lot hinged on his performance during saturday night's debate and things didn't go too
[02:10:57.240 --> 02:11:01.720]  well for him did they david no actually it's kind of interesting it's what you were talking about
[02:11:01.720 --> 02:11:07.160]  with alex earlier the fact that they play this expectation game they come up with a polls and
[02:11:07.160 --> 02:11:11.320]  if you remember they were saying just before iowa they said oh look you know donald trump has been
[02:11:11.320 --> 02:11:16.120]  about four or five points below crews and now he's all of a sudden he's surging he's four or five
[02:11:16.120 --> 02:11:21.400]  points ahead four or five points is about the margin of error so they can play that little game
[02:11:21.400 --> 02:11:26.760]  they can come up with their poll numbers and then if you don't meet their expectations they proclaim
[02:11:26.760 --> 02:11:33.720]  you the loser but as ted cruise said it was uh i guess uh bronze is the new gold that was the way
[02:11:33.720 --> 02:11:37.800]  they were portraying everything clearly marco rubio was the candidate that the establishment
[02:11:37.800 --> 02:11:42.920]  wanted to get behind that's the one that the big money was coalescing behind let's play this clip
[02:11:42.920 --> 02:11:48.280]  from the debate on saturday i think it's one of the most interesting clips because it reveals
[02:11:48.280 --> 02:11:52.760]  the method of how they manipulate people and that's what's important that's why we cover
[02:11:52.760 --> 02:11:59.320]  these debates that's why we uh look at the issues it's the way they use this game and of course he
[02:11:59.320 --> 02:12:05.560]  was called out in the middle of using this uh technique by chris christie let's play that clip
[02:12:06.680 --> 02:12:10.520]  and let's dispel once and for all with this fiction that barack obama doesn't know what he's doing
[02:12:10.520 --> 02:12:15.800]  he knows exactly what he's doing barack obama is undertaking a systematic effort to change this
[02:12:15.800 --> 02:12:20.520]  country to make america more like the rest of the world that's why he passed obama care and the
[02:12:20.520 --> 02:12:26.120]  stimulus and dod frank and a deal with iran it is a systematic effort to change america when i'm
[02:12:26.120 --> 02:12:31.240]  president of the united to re-embrace all the things that made america the greatest nation in the world
[02:12:31.240 --> 02:12:35.160]  and we are going to leave our children what they deserve the single greatest nation in the history
[02:12:35.160 --> 02:12:39.480]  of the world under chris christie's governorship of new jersey they've been downgraded nine times in
[02:12:39.480 --> 02:12:43.880]  their credit rating we don't need to add to it by electing someone who has experience at running up
[02:12:43.880 --> 02:12:47.720]  and and destroying the credit rating of the state but i would add this let's just say here's number
[02:12:47.720 --> 02:12:52.200]  two here's the second time he repeats the exact same phrase change this country he wants america to
[02:12:52.200 --> 02:12:54.760]  become more like the rest of the world we don't want to be like the rest of the world we want to be
[02:12:54.760 --> 02:12:57.960]  the united states of america and when i'm elected president this will become once again the single
[02:12:57.960 --> 02:13:02.120]  greatest nation in the history of marco robato as opposed to everybody i want the people at home
[02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:07.560]  to think about this that's what washington dc does the drive-by shot at the beginning exposes
[02:13:07.560 --> 02:13:13.080]  the method complete information right here and then the memorized 25 second speech that is exactly
[02:13:13.080 --> 02:13:18.360]  what he's already done that same little 25 second speech twice i hear he comes again two weeks ago
[02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:22.280]  you didn't even want to go back they had to shame you into going back and then you stayed there for
[02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:27.960]  36 hours and then he left and came back to campaign those are the facts who's the bottom line this
[02:13:27.960 --> 02:13:32.120]  notion that brock obama doesn't know what he's doing is just not there it is he knows exactly what
[02:13:32.120 --> 02:13:37.800]  he memorized 25 second speech that's the reason why this campaign is so important because i think
[02:13:37.800 --> 02:13:42.120]  this notion i think he doesn't stop he keeps going even when he's called out he doesn't have
[02:13:42.120 --> 02:13:47.000]  anything to say okay so let's fade it down he just keeps on going he does it one more time after that
[02:13:47.000 --> 02:13:52.280]  because he doesn't have anything else to say except for his little memorized talking points
[02:13:52.280 --> 02:13:57.800]  and that was a very powerful moment you know paul we've had moments like this in presidential debates
[02:13:57.800 --> 02:14:03.640]  before we had the one of the famous moments where dan quail had frequently been comparing himself to
[02:14:03.640 --> 02:14:09.640]  jfk because he was very young of course he wasn't as inexperienced as marco rubio who immediately
[02:14:09.640 --> 02:14:14.840]  began running for president as soon as he got elected just like ted cruz but he was comparing
[02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:21.160]  himself to jfk and loy benson who was from texas who there was a vice presidential debate he knew
[02:14:21.160 --> 02:14:26.120]  this was coming up and so he had a sound bite prepared to come back and say i knew jfk you're
[02:14:26.120 --> 02:14:31.880]  no jfk and george bush is no ronald reagan that was a sound bite and that really was a zinger
[02:14:31.880 --> 02:14:37.880]  that's typically the way that it's done but in this debate marco rubio did it to himself and
[02:14:37.880 --> 02:14:43.560]  continued to do him to himself he couldn't stop himself from continuing to repeat that line and
[02:14:43.560 --> 02:14:48.360]  that's why everybody is talking about how it looks like he's basically jumped the shark a lot of
[02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:55.000]  people are talking about how uh he looks like he's uh it's it's killed his momentum we have people
[02:14:55.000 --> 02:14:59.960]  who are uh pointing out that the next day he not only doubled down but he tripled down repeating
[02:14:59.960 --> 02:15:04.520]  that same phrase over and over again and i think it's interesting paul that when we look at
[02:15:05.400 --> 02:15:12.040]  the exchange that what he had with uh richard reeves about the tpp richard reeves began that
[02:15:12.040 --> 02:15:18.120]  report with a clip from marco rubio going before the cfr talking about how he wanted to give
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:24.360]  trade promotion authority to uh president obama so that he could basically here's a quote he says
[02:15:24.360 --> 02:15:29.160]  it's more important than ever that congress give the president trade promotion authority and finalize
[02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:35.480]  the trans pacific and transatlantic partnerships okay but why would he do that if he says that uh
[02:15:35.480 --> 02:15:41.720]  obama knows exactly what he's doing he's undertaking a systematic effort to change this country that is
[02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:48.520]  part of the systematic effort to change this country the tpp and the ttip this transatlantic
[02:15:48.520 --> 02:15:54.920]  partnership yeah and i mean it you watch someone like rand paul in the debates he's not going to
[02:15:54.920 --> 02:16:00.200]  keep going back to that repeated rhetoric over and over again because so he's not a hypocrite and he
[02:16:00.200 --> 02:16:06.360]  has principles if you have those two things you don't have to rely on these stock responses the
[02:16:06.360 --> 02:16:11.160]  kind that we saw from rubio and what's interesting about it is you were talking about earlier
[02:16:11.160 --> 02:16:16.520]  you know rubio getting the bronze and that being heralded by the establishment as a great achievement
[02:16:16.520 --> 02:16:21.480]  now they've set it up now they're saying in new hampshire if he beats the other two establishment
[02:16:21.480 --> 02:16:28.120]  candidates nearest to him case itch and bosh that that's going to propel him forward as the main
[02:16:28.120 --> 02:16:34.200]  challenger to trump and cruise so it will be interesting if he doesn't beat both bosh and case
[02:16:34.200 --> 02:16:40.040]  itch if again they try to shift the goalposts and say well he performed well anyway he's still the
[02:16:40.040 --> 02:16:45.240]  main challenger to trump and cruise so they're really fair on on rubio when it comes to his
[02:16:45.240 --> 02:16:49.240]  relatively minor achievement says it looks like in new hampshire he's not going to do as well as
[02:16:49.240 --> 02:16:54.680]  he did before purely because of this poor debate performance whereas with trump they're saying
[02:16:54.680 --> 02:16:59.240]  even if he wins by 12 points he's still lost that was what that's what the establishment
[02:16:59.240 --> 02:17:04.760]  republicans are now saying so it's it's the differing forms of treatment for each candidate
[02:17:04.760 --> 02:17:08.840]  based on their performance depending on whether they're part of the establishment or not so it'll
[02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:13.320]  be interesting to see exactly how they treat rubio after new hampshire well it's all part of the
[02:17:13.320 --> 02:17:19.240]  method and that's why it was very important with this debate exchange because christie laid this
[02:17:19.240 --> 02:17:24.120]  right out he said look at what he did he comes up with a bunch of baseless attacks and then he
[02:17:24.120 --> 02:17:28.760]  criticizes obama and then finishes up with a raw raw speech at the end when i'm president
[02:17:29.320 --> 02:17:34.360]  and even after he said that rubio comes back in with that that's what we need to understand
[02:17:34.360 --> 02:17:38.120]  another part of the method we need to pull the curtain back and show people what they're doing
[02:17:38.120 --> 02:17:43.080]  what the mechanism is because they do this every single election the other part of this is
[02:17:43.080 --> 02:17:47.880]  building expectations for a particular candidate and then saying well he didn't fulfill our
[02:17:47.880 --> 02:17:53.480]  artificial expectations which were done by our own internal polling therefore he's a loser projecting
[02:17:53.480 --> 02:17:59.400]  that onto him you don't have to support a candidate to be angry about that kind of manipulation the
[02:17:59.400 --> 02:18:05.080]  same way that we saw ted Cruz manipulate the results by as the the caucuses were beginning
[02:18:05.080 --> 02:18:11.160]  in iowa sending out text messages to people having everyone say in the caucus just as it was beginning
[02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:16.680]  that ben karson was going to drop out those kind of dirty tricks those kinds of tactics and the
[02:18:16.680 --> 02:18:22.680]  people who use them ought to be rejected out of hand whether or not you agree with this particular
[02:18:22.680 --> 02:18:28.760]  can i'm not a ben karson supporter but what happened to ben karson was truly dirty tricks
[02:18:28.760 --> 02:18:34.040]  that was one of the dirtiest tricks they always like to drop something a lie at the last minute
[02:18:34.040 --> 02:18:39.480]  when nobody can respond to it and that was the ultimate example of that dropping that lie just
[02:18:39.480 --> 02:18:45.000]  as the caucus was beginning and doing it using social media to do this throughout all these
[02:18:45.000 --> 02:18:50.280]  various caucuses so now that's what we're going to see in the next phase of this when they look
[02:18:50.280 --> 02:18:55.320]  at the results in new hampshire if trump doesn't win by their pronounced expectations they're going
[02:18:55.320 --> 02:19:00.840]  to pronounce him a loser we should reject those kinds of games we should understand how they play
[02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:06.040]  this game how they use these techniques and we saw one of them exposed yesterday and it was
[02:19:06.040 --> 02:19:12.520]  absolute or saturday is absolutely amazing to watch that happen and we all we also saw a similar
[02:19:12.520 --> 02:19:18.200]  thing with um hillary and sanders of course before iowa microsoft who are helping to count the votes
[02:19:18.200 --> 02:19:23.640]  came out with a prediction based on their bing technology that clinton would win now it was it
[02:19:23.640 --> 02:19:29.240]  was basically neck and neck at that time obviously she won on uh on a win that included these mysterious
[02:19:29.240 --> 02:19:33.960]  coin tosses but again it's perception over reality if you create the perception that somebody's
[02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:40.520]  going to be a loser then that's going to influence people's behavior in a future poll that's why they
[02:19:40.520 --> 02:19:44.280]  do it it's a proven technique and we're seeing it again and again and it's not going to be the last
[02:19:44.280 --> 02:19:49.960]  time we see it um in this election campaign but we'll be back after the break with david knight

[02:24:10.680 --> 02:24:16.120]  well back from the alex jump show i'm paul joseph possum with david knight in studio now the hillary
[02:24:16.120 --> 02:24:22.840]  clinton campaign is flailing so wildly now that you've got bill clinton up there reading mean
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:28.200]  comments about hillary and blaming them on bernie sanders supporters they're actually trying to
[02:24:28.200 --> 02:24:35.640]  characterize the extreme left wing bernie sanders as sexist that's how desperate they're getting
[02:24:35.640 --> 02:24:42.200]  now again with the fact that hillary has no platform no platform whatsoever apart from her
[02:24:42.200 --> 02:24:48.520]  gender we've got sanders who has narrowed the gap nationally the national polls now show that he's
[02:24:48.520 --> 02:24:55.560]  almost neck and neck with hillary of course after hillary being two to one ahead david what does it
[02:24:55.560 --> 02:25:03.080]  say to you about this sheer ineptness of hillary clinton's campaign that she's caved so massively
[02:25:03.080 --> 02:25:08.520]  to bernie sanders someone who essentially in a national election is unelectable
[02:25:09.320 --> 02:25:15.160]  yeah she's losing the momentum but remember paul she still has this criminal urge that is there
[02:25:15.160 --> 02:25:19.720]  and her criminal capability if you look at what happened in iowa i would call it the common core
[02:25:19.720 --> 02:25:25.880]  vote counting there was an article from usa today talking about specific instances where iowans
[02:25:25.880 --> 02:25:30.360]  claimed that the votes were miscounted there was one case in particular where there was only one
[02:25:30.360 --> 02:25:37.560]  caucus goer in this particular district woodbury county number 43 his name is keen schwarz he says
[02:25:38.360 --> 02:25:42.680]  i voted for bernie he told the Des Moines register it was really suspicious i'm actually
[02:25:42.680 --> 02:25:47.480]  pretty i rate about it because he was the only one there at the caucus he voted for bernie and yet
[02:25:47.480 --> 02:25:53.240]  they called it for hillary clinton and gave her a delegate out of that county then they had another
[02:25:53.240 --> 02:25:59.240]  place where they had a five four split in favor of sanders and then that got reversed when it was
[02:25:59.240 --> 02:26:06.040]  reported we saw the same types of things happening with ron paul four years ago that's what the system
[02:26:06.040 --> 02:26:11.320]  does it's a criminal system when it's a close election like it is like like we see now with
[02:26:11.320 --> 02:26:16.920]  sanders and with clinton that's when they will start pulling the criminal games of changing the vote
[02:26:16.920 --> 02:26:22.680]  counts and again because this has the potential even though you know none of us would agree with
[02:26:22.680 --> 02:26:28.680]  sanders policies to completely eviscerate the democratic party just as trump has done with
[02:26:28.680 --> 02:26:34.600]  the establishment republicans so it's it's more important to keep that two party monopoly together
[02:26:34.600 --> 02:26:39.960]  than allow this to happen which is now why we've got a report out dc whispers where this inside
[02:26:39.960 --> 02:26:46.360]  source is basically saying you know just like trump they never expected the the fanfare to last
[02:26:46.360 --> 02:26:51.720]  this long and with sanders quote they have no idea what to do with sanders they don't want to offend
[02:26:51.720 --> 02:26:56.440]  and politically displace his supporters while at the same time knowing that if this thing continues
[02:26:56.440 --> 02:27:02.600]  to grow it will destroy the democrat party well i think it's coming down to that now i think paul
[02:27:02.600 --> 02:27:07.480]  that uh what their ace in the hole is with the establishment ace in the hole is is michael bloomberg
[02:27:07.480 --> 02:27:11.400]  we've seen many people talking about this we've seen the presidential debate commission saying oh
[02:27:11.400 --> 02:27:17.160]  yeah we'll open it up for a third party independent meaning bloomberg they keep it very close very
[02:27:17.160 --> 02:27:20.920]  controlled they don't want to have real third parties in there but they'll open it up for
[02:27:20.920 --> 02:27:26.920]  michael bloomberg he would be the establishment ringer if hillary clinton loses to sanders or
[02:27:26.920 --> 02:27:30.680]  if she's indicted if something like that happens and he has plenty of time to do this a lot of
[02:27:30.680 --> 02:27:34.760]  people talk about how they think joe biden might get in the race i don't think that's going to happen
[02:27:34.760 --> 02:27:39.480]  back in november uh they were talking about the fact that biden needed to make up his mind at
[02:27:39.480 --> 02:27:44.120]  that point if he didn't put himself on the ballot in four or five states in november he was going
[02:27:44.120 --> 02:27:50.280]  to lose the possibility of getting nearly 500 delegates there are time limits in which the
[02:27:50.280 --> 02:27:55.960]  democrat and republican candidates need to sign up in order to uh have a chance to to uh be on the
[02:27:55.960 --> 02:28:02.600]  ballot for those parties but it is a later time limit for those who come in as independents if
[02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:06.360]  bloomberg as he says he's going to wait until sometime in march he's going to wait until after
[02:28:06.360 --> 02:28:11.160]  super tuesday he'll see how the election returns are going he'll see also try to get a feel as to
[02:28:11.160 --> 02:28:15.640]  whether or not hillary is going to be indicted but he doesn't really have to start getting onto
[02:28:15.640 --> 02:28:21.400]  the ballots in all these states until august or september he could easily do that and he could come
[02:28:21.400 --> 02:28:27.400]  in as the establishment candidate and that's what he said he would do if the two choices are sanders
[02:28:27.400 --> 02:28:33.240]  and trump okay david just rounding up here in the final minute other issues that you'll be covering
[02:28:33.240 --> 02:28:36.680]  on the fourth hour of the show today well we're going to talk a little bit about i don't know if
[02:28:36.680 --> 02:28:42.360]  you talked about this paul i don't think so the french general uh former general of the foreign
[02:28:42.360 --> 02:28:46.360]  legion was arrested because he went to calais the place you've talked about many times how
[02:28:46.360 --> 02:28:52.280]  bad the violence is there at that french port uh the massive out of control immigrants they said
[02:28:52.280 --> 02:28:59.080]  nobody is going to talk in protest of our open border policy he along with others spoke out about
[02:28:59.080 --> 02:29:03.480]  that they arrested him we're also going to talk about some ohio homeschoolers that are facing
[02:29:03.480 --> 02:29:09.240]  criminal charges because they didn't fill out the paperwork to the satisfaction of the bureaucracy
[02:29:09.240 --> 02:29:13.720]  what is governor casick going to do about that the guy who's running for president is he going to
[02:29:13.720 --> 02:29:18.680]  allow these homeschoolers to go to jail we'll see but we're also going to take a look in detail
[02:29:18.680 --> 02:29:24.360]  at marco rubio's hypocrisy saying that we know what obama is doing he's trying to take this country
[02:29:24.360 --> 02:29:31.640]  down and yet saying we want to turn over the power to him look rubio and tray gowdy are outsourcing
[02:29:31.640 --> 02:29:36.200]  congress they're not just content with exporting jobs and importing workers they're outsourcing
[02:29:36.200 --> 02:29:42.200]  their job to a multinational commission okay david not be sure to tune in for the fourth
[02:29:42.200 --> 02:29:47.240]  hour of the broadcast we'll be right like with more news it's the island show live don't go away
[02:29:47.240 --> 02:29:54.760]  we're on the march the empire's on the run alex jones and the gcn radio network
[02:29:58.600 --> 02:30:02.600]  here's what donald trump must do to finish strong in new hampshire according to veteran glp
[02:30:02.600 --> 02:30:08.680]  strategist roger stone he said quote trump must return to the core issues that put him way way
[02:30:08.680 --> 02:30:13.960]  out front stealing our borders building the wall recharging our economy addressing trade imbalances
[02:30:13.960 --> 02:30:18.600]  taking care of our veterans in destroying isis the veteran glp strategist also said that trump
[02:30:18.600 --> 02:30:23.480]  should talk about the trump tax plan praised by supply side guru larry kudrow we know trump is
[02:30:23.480 --> 02:30:29.160]  very very rich we want to hear how he would make us rich stone continues stating the rise of rubio
[02:30:29.160 --> 02:30:34.120]  is very real but trump must dispatch cruises a viable candidate before he can face off with rubio
[02:30:34.120 --> 02:30:38.280]  who will continue to be a factor in the palomado state but rubio may have already taken himself
[02:30:38.280 --> 02:30:42.440]  down considering his robotic performance during saturday's debate in which he used the same
[02:30:42.440 --> 02:30:47.160]  memorized line at least eight times showing he's a pretty programmed establishment candidate who
[02:30:47.160 --> 02:30:51.160]  can't speak off the cuff the glp strategist also revealed that credible polls have trump
[02:30:51.160 --> 02:30:55.240]  running a substantially head where romney mccain finished along african americans you can find

[02:33:40.040 --> 02:33:45.160]  formation performance members of the national sheriffs association meeting in washington
[02:33:45.160 --> 02:33:51.000]  turn their backs on beyond say during a super bowl halftime party angered that the nfl allowed
[02:33:51.000 --> 02:33:56.600]  her to sing a song that they consider anti police so beyond so basically got up at the halftime
[02:33:56.600 --> 02:34:02.600]  super bowl show which of course routinely year after year is used for political propaganda
[02:34:02.600 --> 02:34:10.360]  purposes she donned a black leather suit with ammunition affixed to the arms bullets surrounded
[02:34:10.360 --> 02:34:18.680]  by these black panther chic dancers to ram home again the divisive racist message of black lives
[02:34:18.680 --> 02:34:25.560]  matter his mark dice to break it down beyond say's entire super bowl halftime performance
[02:34:25.560 --> 02:34:33.080]  was a black power propaganda piece to invigorate the black lives matter movement and was dedicated
[02:34:33.080 --> 02:34:40.280]  to malcolm x who advocated the use of violence i'll break it down for you in this video people
[02:34:40.280 --> 02:34:46.120]  doubted my prediction before the super bowl and here we go boff met bimbo the booty shaker
[02:34:46.120 --> 02:34:55.320]  dressed wearing what looks to be like ammunition as a black power militant accompanied by an all
[02:34:55.320 --> 02:35:04.200]  black dance crew very diverse of beyond say who were dressed as the black panthers wearing their
[02:35:04.200 --> 02:35:12.680]  trademark black beret this photo posted by tina nulls beyond say's own mother on instagram showing
[02:35:12.680 --> 02:35:23.160]  her with the dancers giving the black power salute of course she dropped her song formation the music
[02:35:23.160 --> 02:35:31.720]  video the day before the super bowl again a call to arms to the black lives matter movement their
[02:35:31.720 --> 02:35:39.720]  rallying cry hands up don't shoot an entire fraud the biggest fraud of 2015 michael brown
[02:35:39.720 --> 02:35:46.120]  in fergus in missouri the six foot four three hundred pound thug all evidence confirms that he
[02:35:46.120 --> 02:35:52.840]  assaulted the police officer after committing a felony strong armed robbery the mentally enslaved
[02:35:52.840 --> 02:36:02.040]  masses following the fraud and the lies from booty shaking boff met bimbo believe that he was
[02:36:02.040 --> 02:36:08.280]  viciously gunned down with his hands up and then a year later at the one year anniversary
[02:36:08.280 --> 02:36:16.120]  one of his close friends pulled a gun and started shooting at police and then was put down like an
[02:36:16.120 --> 02:36:23.960]  animal tyrone harris before anybody could even think everyone started all the police have killed
[02:36:23.960 --> 02:36:29.480]  another black man i think he lived actually they shot another black man and then all evidence came
[02:36:29.480 --> 02:36:39.480]  out that he owned and was actually arrested earlier for stolen weapons charges he had opened fire here
[02:36:39.480 --> 02:36:43.960]  he is pictured on his facebook page with some guns uh yeah he wasn't even 21 season i'm supposed to
[02:36:43.960 --> 02:36:49.800]  have those but that's michael brown's good friend ty glock who opened fire on police at the one year
[02:36:49.800 --> 02:36:57.480]  anniversary of the ferguson festival this is the fraud being perpetuated by the black lives matter
[02:36:57.480 --> 02:37:06.600]  movement and their celebrity goddess Beyonce who was draped in what looked like bullets in
[02:37:06.600 --> 02:37:14.280]  what looks to be a call to a violent socialist revolution look at these people absolutely
[02:37:14.280 --> 02:37:22.840]  despicable yes the man shot by ferguson good friend with michael brown ty glocks yeah yep
[02:37:22.840 --> 02:37:30.680]  of course bop met bimbo flashed this illuminati hand sign back at the stupor bowl in 2013 the
[02:37:30.680 --> 02:37:35.400]  mentally enslaved masses just love it they got all drunk to a big day for domestic violence
[02:37:35.400 --> 02:37:42.680]  to laugh Beyonce's super bowl halftime performance again a political prostitute pitch for the black
[02:37:42.680 --> 02:37:48.760]  lives matter movement which has been flagging after it merged that shawn king one of the de facto
[02:37:48.760 --> 02:37:54.600]  leaders of black lives matter was not in all probability black again that movement continues
[02:37:54.600 --> 02:38:01.320]  to crumble because it's based on extremism the ideological founder the inspiration behind black
[02:38:01.320 --> 02:38:07.320]  lives matter is a domestic terrorist who killed a carp in new jersey and is actually on the fbi's
[02:38:07.320 --> 02:38:12.600]  top 10 most wanted domestic terrorist lists but again you're never going to see
[02:38:12.600 --> 02:38:19.720]  the origan militia people represented at super bowl halftime shows but you're going to see that
[02:38:19.720 --> 02:38:25.160]  kind of extremism represented by Beyonce again a few years ago she was up there dancing with riot
[02:38:25.160 --> 02:38:32.760]  cops now she's dancing around with black panthers in this anti police pro black lives matter
[02:38:32.760 --> 02:38:38.200]  divisive way and now they're actually protesting against it looks like there's going to be a boycott
[02:38:38.200 --> 02:38:42.600]  so that controversy continues to build but we got richard reeves on the line we're first going
[02:38:42.600 --> 02:38:47.240]  to go to a couple of videos because obviously richard has been down there on the ground in
[02:38:47.240 --> 02:38:53.320]  iowa in new hampshire four info wars over the past two or three weeks first up if you didn't see this
[02:38:53.320 --> 02:39:01.320]  this is where richard confronts marco rubio on the tpp let's take a look it is more important than
[02:39:01.320 --> 02:39:06.200]  ever that congress give the president trade promotion authority so that he can finalize the
[02:39:06.200 --> 02:39:11.560]  trans-specific partnership and the transatlantic trade and investment partnership thank you senator
[02:39:11.560 --> 02:39:16.200]  rubio last year you spoke at a council on foreign relations meeting and you were a big proponent of
[02:39:16.200 --> 02:39:23.400]  the tpp and i was just wondering the tpp diminishes our us sovereignty and also potentially destroys
[02:39:23.400 --> 02:39:27.560]  our one supporter now i'm a supporter of free trade i'm i have to see if this deal is a good
[02:39:27.560 --> 02:39:31.160]  deal it's being reviewed now by the international trade commission so if it's a good deal i'll
[02:39:31.160 --> 02:39:34.920]  support it if it's not it has to be renegotiated well at what point does it get seen because it's
[02:39:34.920 --> 02:39:38.520]  been kept secret no it's out there the international trade commission was reviewing it they'll
[02:39:38.520 --> 02:39:42.600]  issue the report in may so until then i'm not even going to take a position on it so i got to see what
[02:39:42.600 --> 02:39:47.160]  the deal i got to see all it's five thousand pages so it's very dense five thousand pages yeah so have
[02:39:47.160 --> 02:39:50.840]  you been able to read off five thousand and i'm not going to even try until the it because the
[02:39:50.840 --> 02:39:55.480]  international trade commission comes back and finds that it's not good for america or the i won't
[02:39:55.480 --> 02:39:59.960]  get out to go back and renegotiate so basically you would probably make a bunch of people wait okay
[02:39:59.960 --> 02:40:06.040]  thank you thank you so what about his past support of the tpp which could endanger us irony and open
[02:40:06.040 --> 02:40:11.320]  up the floodgates of immigration what about that well i don't think he's voted on tpp voted on tpa
[02:40:11.320 --> 02:40:17.000]  which allows us to consider tpp but but we haven't voted on tpp yet they also spoke at the council on
[02:40:17.000 --> 02:40:23.160]  foreign relations it was a big proponent of it there well i i can't speak to that because i wasn't
[02:40:23.160 --> 02:40:28.360]  there okay so if you if you can find a candidate that's perfect let me know because there's only
[02:40:28.360 --> 02:40:37.240]  good one and he ain't run it so thank you yes sir there's richard reeves talking to marco rubio about
[02:40:37.240 --> 02:40:43.880]  the tpp exposing his hypocrisy on that reeves also got the chance to ask hillary clinton a question
[02:40:43.880 --> 02:40:51.320]  about the email hack here's that clip last week it was reported on info wars dot com that your
[02:40:51.320 --> 02:40:55.720]  email server was hacked and you know and leave continued to use your email server can you comment
[02:40:55.720 --> 02:41:03.720]  on that yeah it's totally untrue okay thanks guys thank you okay here we go again there's richard
[02:41:03.720 --> 02:41:08.840]  reeves asking hillary clinton about the email hack and we're joined by richard reeves from new
[02:41:08.840 --> 02:41:14.040]  hampshire richard you've been on the ground there for info wars we've got the polls telling us that
[02:41:14.040 --> 02:41:21.080]  it's going to be a a one to win for bernie sanders and donald trump um a quite comfortable margin
[02:41:21.080 --> 02:41:28.520]  looking at the current figures the gop establishment is now framing it if trump only wins by 12 points
[02:41:28.520 --> 02:41:33.640]  he's lost so what are you seeing down there on the ground in new hampshire what can you tell us
[02:41:34.920 --> 02:41:39.560]  well paul thank you and we can only hope that the polls are actually correct because they're
[02:41:39.560 --> 02:41:43.880]  really in danger of losing a lot of credibility on these polls if they don't match what they're
[02:41:43.880 --> 02:41:50.280]  coming up with on as far as these numbers now here on the ground the sense is that the polls
[02:41:50.280 --> 02:41:56.120]  are correct um we've had you know marco rubio you played that clip just a little while ago so
[02:41:56.120 --> 02:42:01.560]  he hasn't really been attacked on the tpp yet although donald trump did foreshadow talking about
[02:42:01.560 --> 02:42:07.560]  tpp more in this past debate where as i'm sure most of our audience already knows that the
[02:42:07.560 --> 02:42:14.120]  audience was stacked totally in favor of the gop establishment so um here boots on the ground the
[02:42:14.120 --> 02:42:19.640]  other candidates to watch i actually see marco rubio here is probably in in danger of falling
[02:42:19.640 --> 02:42:26.760]  fourth or fifth place because of the fact that you've got kasek and chris christy have done a lot
[02:42:26.760 --> 02:42:33.800]  of groundwork we did go to a kasek event yesterday and he had an event that almost paralleled marco
[02:42:33.800 --> 02:42:39.560]  rubio's friday night event and considering he's done a hundred town halls kasek has done a hundred
[02:42:39.560 --> 02:42:47.240]  town halls uh i think that potentially you could see uh trump followed by uh a combination of crews
[02:42:47.240 --> 02:42:55.320]  kasek christy rubio somehow in that order with uh i think it'll obviously it should be donald trump
[02:42:55.320 --> 02:43:00.840]  on top and i think he really won the debate the other day when he exposed the fact that crowd
[02:43:00.840 --> 02:43:07.480]  was a bunch of insiders well yeah obviously he said they were put there to cheer his opponents
[02:43:07.480 --> 02:43:12.360]  in the debate and that's exactly what seemed to unfold but with rubio they've been saying for
[02:43:12.360 --> 02:43:17.640]  quite a few days now you know after this bronze finish in iowa which would which was heralded by
[02:43:17.640 --> 02:43:23.640]  the establishment as a huge success they were saying he was on course to beat bosh and kasek
[02:43:23.640 --> 02:43:30.280]  in new hampshire and that he needed to do so to propel himself as the number one quote establishment
[02:43:30.280 --> 02:43:37.960]  candidate which would then see him emerge as a direct competitor with crews and trump so if
[02:43:37.960 --> 02:43:43.160]  you know if if rubio doesn't beat bosh and kasek do you think that that is his campaign basically
[02:43:43.160 --> 02:43:50.120]  over actually not necessarily because i think what we figured out over this past weekend and
[02:43:50.120 --> 02:43:55.480]  we've talked about on past shows about g.o.p splitter strategy they have a delegate strategy
[02:43:55.480 --> 02:44:01.240]  that they want to take to cleveland ohio in july at the rnc where they can still install one of
[02:44:01.240 --> 02:44:07.560]  the favored candidates which are kasek christy bush rubio and it what it really looks like is
[02:44:07.560 --> 02:44:13.000]  they want to keep having results that maybe are a little bit mixed maybe don trump is winning
[02:44:13.000 --> 02:44:18.200]  consistently but the other three or four down the ballot keeps splitting up the delegate counts in
[02:44:18.200 --> 02:44:23.960]  proportional states where don trump can't achieve the delegate counts he needs so they they don't
[02:44:23.960 --> 02:44:29.400]  want it to go to a two-man race whereas don trump versus whoever very quickly they want to stretch
[02:44:29.400 --> 02:44:34.760]  that out and i think they want to stretch that out at least at least until the middle of march
[02:44:34.760 --> 02:44:40.440]  when we see some winter take all states like ohio in florida uh like say the g.o.p. does have a
[02:44:40.440 --> 02:44:45.640]  delegate strategy and they can pull off that delegate strategy i'm convinced because of the
[02:44:45.640 --> 02:44:51.880]  way they took that crowd in this debate list this last saturday that demonstrates that they can get
[02:44:51.880 --> 02:44:57.960]  their g.o.p. establishment minions to show up at events they know who they are they call them up they
[02:44:57.960 --> 02:45:04.680]  email them etc and their plan is to take that level of crowd that type of crowd to cleveland
[02:45:04.680 --> 02:45:10.520]  and if in fact don trump does not have probably 60 of the delegates going into the cleveland
[02:45:10.520 --> 02:45:18.040]  convention then my prediction is is that they will install a nominee that is has not defeated
[02:45:18.040 --> 02:45:23.640]  don trump in primaries or caucuses in the states he'll do it they'll do it at the convention
[02:45:23.640 --> 02:45:29.160]  they'll just install whoever they want now looking at bernie sanders we've got this article
[02:45:29.160 --> 02:45:35.560]  out of reuters today presidential hopeful sanders clinton in dead heat the montaneter bernie sanders
[02:45:35.560 --> 02:45:40.520]  has erased secretary of state hillary clinton's widely for the democratic presidential nomination
[02:45:40.520 --> 02:45:46.280]  since the start of the year putting the two in a dead heat nationally according to this new reuters
[02:45:46.280 --> 02:45:52.120]  ipsos poll clinton leads sanders 48 percent 45 percent among democratic voters according to the
[02:45:52.120 --> 02:45:58.760]  poll of 512 americans so clinton had this two to one margin at the beginning of the year that's
[02:45:58.760 --> 02:46:05.480]  been completely eviscerated over the past few weeks we've now got inside sources basically saying
[02:46:05.480 --> 02:46:11.960]  just as with trump they never expected this wave of bernie sanders populism to continue
[02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:16.680]  obviously we don't agree with the vast majority of his policies but it seems now inside us within
[02:46:16.680 --> 02:46:22.360]  the democratic party are terrified of bernie sanders that he could rip apart the fabric of the
[02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:29.560]  democrat party itself how do you see it going forward obviously his tip to basically obliterate
[02:46:29.560 --> 02:46:35.160]  hillary in new hampshire how do you see it going forward in the rounds after that well
[02:46:36.040 --> 02:46:41.000]  we've talked about it before a little bit on the sunday show and i'll try to show that
[02:46:41.000 --> 02:46:46.280]  donald trump is the reason that bernie sanders became competitive right there at the end of the
[02:46:46.280 --> 02:46:51.240]  year the first of the new year you remember hillary clinton made a shot across the bow that
[02:46:51.240 --> 02:46:56.760]  that donald trump was a sexist misogynist etc and donald trump fired right back right away
[02:46:57.480 --> 02:47:02.920]  the next day hillary just zipped her lips didn't talk about it anymore but i think that was like
[02:47:02.920 --> 02:47:09.720]  that explosive in the bottom of a of a big damn holding up a lady that slowly but surely is cracking
[02:47:09.720 --> 02:47:15.640]  and crumbling and it's breaking loose now you saw what happened in iowa that bernie you know
[02:47:15.640 --> 02:47:20.440]  pretty much there was a tie with a few different coin flips bernie actually wins iowa which you
[02:47:20.440 --> 02:47:26.200]  wasn't expected to at all and then new hampshire i think he is going to win new hampshire uh so
[02:47:26.200 --> 02:47:32.040]  that momentum from winning new hampshire plus the fact that he is getting paul listen to this he
[02:47:32.040 --> 02:47:39.080]  at last account which was about a week ago he said that he'd had 3.5 million people donate
[02:47:39.080 --> 02:47:45.000]  an average of 27 dollars a piece so you're talking about that he's got you know 80 to 100 million
[02:47:45.000 --> 02:47:50.840]  dollar war chest going into these other states so the bernie sanders situation that he might be
[02:47:50.840 --> 02:47:56.680]  able to beat hillary is a real deal now the question is with both hillary and trump the
[02:47:56.680 --> 02:48:01.800]  delegate strategies both exist because in the case we talked to a super delegate just the other day
[02:48:01.800 --> 02:48:06.440]  i don't upload the video yet but we talked to one of the democrat super delegates the other day
[02:48:06.440 --> 02:48:11.240]  and bernie sanders really needs to be winning it when he's winning he needs to win big in these
[02:48:11.240 --> 02:48:18.200]  states so he gets big majorities of delegates he needs to have about 60 of the delegates it
[02:48:18.200 --> 02:48:25.320]  can't be 50.1 or he'll still get defeated defeated at the dnc it has to be about 60 same thing for
[02:48:25.320 --> 02:48:32.200]  trump they've got to win 60 majorities of the delegates going into these conventions and uh
[02:48:32.200 --> 02:48:40.440]  otherwise the candidates will figure out a way to play the rules break the rules the rules check the
[02:48:40.440 --> 02:48:47.400]  rules to get their preferred establishment candidates in paul and again we see the desperation
[02:48:47.400 --> 02:48:52.840]  in the clinton campaign you've got bill clinton up whining about mean internet comments sexist
[02:48:52.840 --> 02:48:58.200]  misogynistic comments about hillary blaming them on sanders supporters the very same tactic they
[02:48:58.200 --> 02:49:03.880]  tried against trump last year now they're trying to transpose that on to bernie it's having very
[02:49:03.880 --> 02:49:10.200]  little success judging by the media backlash we've got the woman who accused bill clinton of assault
[02:49:10.200 --> 02:49:15.000]  to campaign against hillary's presidential run so things appear to be getting more desperate
[02:49:15.000 --> 02:49:20.760]  for hillary but in the final 90 seconds here just your final observations on what's unfolding in new
[02:49:20.760 --> 02:49:27.000]  hampshire well tomorrow's going to be an interesting day and we're going to find out these polls are
[02:49:27.000 --> 02:49:31.160]  finally going to be correct so uh we're hoping for a donald trump win and we're hoping to see
[02:49:31.160 --> 02:49:35.160]  him run the table and we're hoping for folks out there to get to their precinct conventions and
[02:49:35.160 --> 02:49:39.960]  caucuses both on the dem side and the republican side otherwise the establishment will have their
[02:49:39.960 --> 02:49:47.080]  way and put in their nominations okay richard reeves reporting live from new hampshire for

[02:50:19.320 --> 02:50:27.320]  they're saying that aleppo quote could soon fall of course that implies that it's about to fall to
[02:50:27.320 --> 02:50:35.000]  enemy forces when in reality the people in control of aleppo in syria right now are the same fsa g
[02:50:35.000 --> 02:50:41.480]  hadis who defected to isis who gave weapons to isis which again the obama white house has been

[02:56:43.000 --> 02:56:48.760]  the british army is deploying at 1600 troops in jordan to take part in war games which could be a
[02:56:48.760 --> 02:56:54.920]  preparation for a potential confrontation between russia and nato member countries on the flip side
[02:56:54.920 --> 02:57:02.520]  we've also got russia engaged in massive new war games so that tension continues to build
[02:57:02.520 --> 02:57:09.000]  meanwhile over in germany after we had the uh cologne festival double the police presence and
[02:57:09.000 --> 02:57:15.320]  still there were molestations and rapes now in mines the carnival in germany mines the town
[02:57:15.320 --> 02:57:22.360]  of mines has been cancelled the official reason was expected stormy weather conditions but this
[02:57:22.360 --> 02:57:29.560]  was just days after police raided uh an address in mines and arrested potential isis terrorists so
[02:57:29.560 --> 02:57:36.120]  again let's not let the terrorists win by allowing them to change our way of life well that's exactly
[02:57:36.120 --> 02:57:43.080]  what we're doing by canceling these kind of events also got this article which um i wrote professor
[02:57:43.080 --> 02:57:47.960]  demands mandatory arabic lessons for german children the prominent professors demanded that
[02:57:47.960 --> 02:57:53.080]  children in germany be made to take mandatory arabic lessons in order to help the millions of
[02:57:53.080 --> 02:57:57.960]  muslim migrants pouring into the country this is a computer science professor top professor
[02:57:58.760 --> 02:58:04.920]  basically wants arabic to be compulsory for german school children even though it won't benefit them
[02:58:04.920 --> 02:58:11.320]  again this is another example of germans having to assimilate into the culture of migrants when it
[02:58:11.320 --> 02:58:17.000]  should be the other way around we got a lot more breaking news at info wars dot com but that's

[03:00:21.880 --> 03:00:28.360]  we're going to be talking about marco rubato and we're going to look at rubio versus rubio
[03:00:29.000 --> 03:00:34.280]  remember that phyllis schlafly was one of the first people to support him in his campaign for senate
[03:00:34.280 --> 03:00:38.600]  many people thought that he was going to be a tea party candidate in other words somebody who was
[03:00:38.600 --> 03:00:45.320]  going to support limited government we saw just the opposite happen rubio ran as a conservative
[03:00:45.320 --> 03:00:51.400]  then governed as an establishment player betraying the very people who had supported him as a matter
[03:00:51.400 --> 03:00:55.800]  of fact as part of the gang of eight he was chosen to be the one who was going to placate and
[03:00:55.800 --> 03:01:01.960]  mollify the conservatives who would oppose open borders and we've seen this kind of betrayal
[03:01:01.960 --> 03:01:08.840]  over and over again we're going to look in detail at what his robotic response this little 25 second
[03:01:08.840 --> 03:01:13.800]  soundbite that he had of course it was a very important because it revealed the method of
[03:01:13.800 --> 03:01:21.000]  manipulating people but also what he said about obama and then what he said about the tpp as we
[03:01:21.000 --> 03:01:25.800]  had richard reese on last hour talking about that i want to break that down a little bit more detail
[03:01:25.800 --> 03:01:31.400]  about what both he and tre gowdy said we're also going to look at the back and forth exchange and
[03:01:31.400 --> 03:01:37.160]  the debate between jeb bush and donald trump on imminent domain that is a very important issue
[03:01:37.160 --> 03:01:41.720]  it's one i think that donald trump is very wrong on but of course it was also interesting to see
[03:01:41.720 --> 03:01:48.600]  how jeb bush didn't really understand the issue at all he was told to attack donald trump on this
[03:01:48.600 --> 03:01:53.800]  issue but he was absolutely clueless about what he was talking about we're going to talk about that
[03:01:53.800 --> 03:01:59.880]  as well we're going to take a look at the moves to come after hillary clinton is she going to be
[03:01:59.880 --> 03:02:05.080]  indicted many people are now calling for the attorney general a red a lynch to step aside and
[03:02:05.080 --> 03:02:11.000]  let somebody who isn't so politically connected take a look at this what will happen if she
[03:02:11.000 --> 03:02:16.440]  moves aside but most importantly we're going to be covering the new hampshire primary tomorrow
[03:02:16.440 --> 03:02:20.760]  it's going to be the very first primary in the nation of course we had the iowa caucus it's a
[03:02:20.760 --> 03:02:25.720]  little bit different this is going to be a straight up and down vote but it isn't going to be exactly
[03:02:25.720 --> 03:02:31.800]  as straight up and down as you may think and those variances in that may work out to donald trump's
[03:02:31.800 --> 03:02:39.560]  advantage anybody that doesn't get 10 or more those votes will go to the winner so the takeaway
[03:02:39.560 --> 03:02:44.600]  of this is not really a vote total it really is the number of delegates that you get in each one
[03:02:44.600 --> 03:02:48.520]  of these contests and of course the contests that are going to be happening up until about
[03:02:48.520 --> 03:02:53.800]  the middle of march delegates are awarded proportionally after that it's a winner take all
[03:02:53.800 --> 03:02:59.640]  situation but by that time we're going to have well over 40 of the states will have voted there's
[03:02:59.640 --> 03:03:06.040]  going to be a massive primary on super tuesday march the first but tomorrow is the very first
[03:03:06.040 --> 03:03:10.600]  new hampshire primary we're going to be covering it live with the info wars nightly news crew
[03:03:10.600 --> 03:03:15.960]  we're going to give you the breakdown and analysis as that happens but we're also going to take a
[03:03:15.960 --> 03:03:21.480]  look at the policies of some of these other candidates in terms of the open borders we're
[03:03:21.480 --> 03:03:28.040]  going to take a look at what donald trump is saying about economic issues i think that there is a
[03:03:28.040 --> 03:03:34.440]  very strong case to be made for trump on that one issue alone i think he's the only candidate who is
[03:03:34.440 --> 03:03:39.480]  going to come out against the tpp and again i've not been a supporter of donald trump and i don't
[03:03:39.480 --> 03:03:45.800]  support him on virtually most of the issues i was a supporter of ran paul i support individual
[03:03:45.800 --> 03:03:52.520]  liberty ran paul was the only candidate who was really talking about the security state the massive
[03:03:52.520 --> 03:03:57.960]  police state that's been created in the wake of 9 11 and of course uh he has now dropped out of the
[03:03:57.960 --> 03:04:02.840]  race nobody is taking up that issue do you think that any of these establishment candidates any of
[03:04:02.840 --> 03:04:08.280]  these governors or senators who are remaining care about the surveillance state care about the
[03:04:08.280 --> 03:04:13.160]  massive buildup of the police no none of them do as a matter of fact it's a contest for the
[03:04:13.160 --> 03:04:18.760]  republicans to brag about who's going to step it up the quickest and of course it's not any different
[03:04:18.760 --> 03:04:24.760]  on the democrat side either hillary clinton the person who cannot keep her own emails secret
[03:04:24.760 --> 03:04:32.280]  as the secretary of state is also going to clamp down on you she's going to perpetuate
[03:04:32.280 --> 03:04:37.320]  this surveillance state in a way that you can't imagine bernie sanders do you think he's really
[03:04:37.320 --> 03:04:42.360]  any different about this he says that he is but i don't think he is either so really the one issue
[03:04:42.360 --> 03:04:47.560]  that i see coming up is the trans-specific partnership interestingly enough both sanders
[03:04:47.560 --> 03:04:53.240]  and trump have opposed it can you believe them we're going to take a look at some 30 year old
[03:04:53.240 --> 03:05:00.680]  interviews from donald trump and what he said about trade policy a pro abortion group is attacking
[03:05:00.680 --> 03:05:06.120]  a doritos superbowl ad for humanizing baby fetuses in the ad a pregnant woman is getting an ultrasound
[03:05:06.120 --> 03:05:10.520]  while man besides her realizes the unborn baby will move in the direction of the doritos he's
[03:05:10.520 --> 03:05:14.360]  snacking on the man toys with the baby attempting in vain to reach the chips from the womb until
[03:05:14.360 --> 03:05:18.360]  the mother throws the doritos across the room which prompts the child to launch itself outside
[03:05:18.360 --> 03:05:23.000]  mom and towards the chips in response the national abortion reproductive rights action league said the
[03:05:23.000 --> 03:05:28.840]  ad used an anti-choice tactic of humanizing fetuses the statement source how norrel and similar groups
[03:05:28.840 --> 03:05:33.720]  to humanize the unborn in a vain attempt to justify abortions especially in the aftermath of the
[03:05:33.720 --> 03:05:37.720]  planned parenthood sting videos exposing its officials admitting they sell aborted baby organs
[03:05:37.720 --> 03:05:42.520]  for profit norrel however didn't stop there the group also called out a snickers ad for being
[03:05:42.520 --> 03:05:47.560]  transphobic in a hondi ad for shona dad take away his daughter's autonomy this is all part of the
[03:05:47.560 --> 03:05:52.440]  political correctness campaign spearheaded by the authoritarian left to not only control free speech
[03:05:52.440 --> 03:05:59.160]  but also how people think this is kit daniels with info worse dot com reporting tell folks how you

[03:08:15.160 --> 03:08:20.200]  welcome back to the alex jones show i'm david night your host in this final hour the alex jones
[03:08:20.200 --> 03:08:25.080]  radio broadcast we're going to take a look at the exchange back and forth between jeb bush and
[03:08:25.080 --> 03:08:29.400]  donald trump i think it's very telling so it's a very important issue imminent domain it's not
[03:08:29.400 --> 03:08:35.320]  just something that the establishment has trotted out to go after donald trump it is an important
[03:08:35.320 --> 03:08:43.640]  issue of course it is in the constitution we have the the allowance of taking of private land for
[03:08:43.640 --> 03:08:48.440]  public use in the constitution i don't agree with that i think that's one place where the
[03:08:48.440 --> 03:08:53.400]  constitution needs to be changed but we need to go through the process of amending the constitution
[03:08:53.400 --> 03:08:59.320]  it's just like if you don't agree with the second amendment liberals you don't get to ignore that you
[03:08:59.320 --> 03:09:03.080]  need to change the constitution so i don't think i don't agree with the constitution on imminent
[03:09:03.080 --> 03:09:08.360]  domain i don't think it's necessary as a matter of fact donald trump says that it's necessary he
[03:09:08.360 --> 03:09:11.880]  says it's an absolute necessity for a country you wouldn't have roads you wouldn't have hospitals
[03:09:11.880 --> 03:09:16.360]  you wouldn't have anything he says you wouldn't have schools or bridges and you wouldn't have
[03:09:16.360 --> 03:09:25.000]  the keystone pipeline oh but see the keystone pipeline is taking property for private use
[03:09:25.000 --> 03:09:29.000]  not only is it taking it for private use it's taking it for the private use
[03:09:29.000 --> 03:09:34.440]  of a canadian corporation trans canada's the one that is building the keystone pipeline
[03:09:35.000 --> 03:09:38.840]  and they're the ones who are coming in and telling people who have had farms
[03:09:38.840 --> 03:09:42.680]  and their families for many generations some of them over a hundred years
[03:09:42.680 --> 03:09:46.840]  sorry we're taking your property and we're going to pay you whatever we feel like paying you
[03:09:46.840 --> 03:09:51.240]  we've seen this happen with the national park service coming in and putting pressure
[03:09:51.240 --> 03:09:56.600]  on people taking their property bragging about the fact that one individual remember when we
[03:09:56.600 --> 03:10:00.920]  played that clip one individual who is retiring from one location moving to another they said look
[03:10:00.920 --> 03:10:09.320]  she's taken 110,000 acres in this location she is the acquisition queen then they talked about how
[03:10:09.320 --> 03:10:13.560]  they didn't have the money to get a particular piece of property that belonged to a couple of
[03:10:13.560 --> 03:10:18.360]  miners two little men they said who had fought in world war two they said the property had
[03:10:18.360 --> 03:10:22.360]  appraised at 40 million dollars but they were going to take it and they found a way to take
[03:10:22.360 --> 03:10:28.200]  it for two and a half million dollars not 40 million dollars but two and a half then they bragged
[03:10:28.200 --> 03:10:33.000]  about the fact yeah we're the land people we're the bad guys we take people's property and we
[03:10:33.000 --> 03:10:39.880]  always pay less than it's worth and we look at this I have to say can't we do better than this even
[03:10:39.880 --> 03:10:45.320]  for the taking of public lands look at what happens in China of course we had these articles
[03:10:45.320 --> 03:10:50.840]  in the last year several cases in China one here from the Guardian they're talking about a Chinese
[03:10:50.840 --> 03:10:55.080]  house that became an internet sensation after being left in the middle of a highway because
[03:10:55.080 --> 03:11:00.840]  it's elderly owners refused to move out finally they reached an agreement and it was demolished
[03:11:00.840 --> 03:11:06.360]  this was a case of a 67 year old duck farmer and his wife they refused to sign an agreement allowing
[03:11:06.360 --> 03:11:12.360]  it to be demolished this resulted in authorities building a planned road around the building and
[03:11:12.360 --> 03:11:17.320]  so we look at this picture here if you're watching the broadcast you can see the picture of the
[03:11:17.320 --> 03:11:21.640]  building left in the middle of the road that's not the only time this has happened in China
[03:11:22.280 --> 03:11:29.400]  why is it that communist china respects private property more than the american government
[03:11:29.400 --> 03:11:34.120]  that's the bottom line they continued to negotiate with him and finally he said all right i'm willing
[03:11:34.120 --> 03:11:40.120]  to move but this has become so common the chinese have come up with a term for this they call them
[03:11:40.120 --> 03:11:45.560]  nail houses is what that their word for this means so reference to how they stick out like nails out
[03:11:45.560 --> 03:11:50.920]  of the out of the roads they say nail houses are becoming an increasingly common site during the
[03:11:50.920 --> 03:11:56.360]  country's rapid urbanization and you can look at other articles this link that i gave you guys that
[03:11:56.360 --> 03:12:01.720]  china's nail houses the homeowners who refuse to budge this is from cnn there's a picture of 11
[03:12:01.720 --> 03:12:07.560]  different houses left smack dab in the middle of the road now it's an inconvenience but it doesn't
[03:12:07.560 --> 03:12:13.880]  kill the government project but why should we allow the government to take permanence over
[03:12:13.880 --> 03:12:18.520]  our individual property but this goes even beyond whether or not we should allow imminent
[03:12:18.520 --> 03:12:25.080]  domain for public use we talk about it for private use and of course this was a supreme court case
[03:12:25.080 --> 03:12:31.000]  that happened up in connecticut color versus new london this is a case where some smaller
[03:12:31.000 --> 03:12:36.840]  businessmen were being driven out of business by a larger businessman who wanted their property
[03:12:36.840 --> 03:12:42.040]  for his use he said look it's going to generate more property taxes so he went to the local
[03:12:43.000 --> 03:12:48.520]  government there and said let's take this property i promise that i will build a larger building there
[03:12:48.520 --> 03:12:56.760]  should a bigger business have superior property rights to somebody who has a smaller business
[03:12:56.760 --> 03:13:02.440]  should a bigger business have superior property rights to an individual who has a home that is
[03:13:02.440 --> 03:13:08.120]  the principle that is involved here and once the supreme court made i believe an invalid decision
[03:13:08.120 --> 03:13:13.800]  an unconstitutional decision saying that because imminent domain for public use is allowed in the
[03:13:13.800 --> 03:13:19.400]  constitution then you could say that well if the public is going to get greater tax revenue
[03:13:19.400 --> 03:13:23.560]  then we'll call that public use and we'll let somebody have this for their own private property
[03:13:24.360 --> 03:13:30.760]  say we should be opposing that we should be opposing the idea that big corporations are
[03:13:30.760 --> 03:13:35.000]  going to get subsidies from the small guys that they're going to have special property rights
[03:13:35.000 --> 03:13:41.000]  that the rest of us don't possess and when you don't do that you allow a multinational corporation
[03:13:41.000 --> 03:13:48.520]  like trans canada to come in and take property a canadian corporation taking property from american
[03:13:48.520 --> 03:13:55.000]  citizens to build their pipeline i don't care about the economic about the environmental or
[03:13:55.000 --> 03:14:01.720]  economic issues the keystone pipeline until you get past this imminent domain issue i am not going
[03:14:01.720 --> 03:14:07.800]  to ever support taking private property for a canadian corporation let's play this back and
[03:14:07.800 --> 03:14:13.000]  forth here because it says something about jeb bush as well when he comes after donald trump
[03:14:13.000 --> 03:14:19.400]  let's play a clip of this from the debate what donald trump did was use the domain to try to take
[03:14:19.400 --> 03:14:25.800]  the property of an elderly woman on the strip in atlantic city that is not public purpose that is
[03:14:25.800 --> 03:14:31.240]  down like wrong here's the problem with that all right okay the problem was it was to tear down it
[03:14:31.240 --> 03:14:35.400]  was jeb wants to be he wants to be a tough guy he wants to be a tough guy tonight i didn't take
[03:14:35.400 --> 03:14:40.520]  the property and the net result was you tried i didn't take the property the woman ultimately
[03:14:40.520 --> 03:14:45.880]  didn't want to do that i that is not true and the simple fact isn't to turn this into a limousine
[03:14:45.880 --> 03:14:52.280]  parking lot for his casinos is not about public use and in florida based on that we did we made
[03:14:52.280 --> 03:14:57.240]  that impossible it is part of our constitution that's the better approach that is the conservative
[03:14:57.240 --> 03:15:00.520]  approach just to trump take 30 seconds let me just you know he wants to be a tough guy a lot of
[03:15:00.520 --> 03:15:05.640]  times you'll have you'll have and it doesn't work very well with how tough is it a lot of times
[03:15:05.640 --> 03:15:11.320]  property from an elderly woman let me talk quiet a lot of times a lot of times
[03:15:15.320 --> 03:15:22.200]  that's all of his donors and special interests out there so yeah he's right there was a rigged
[03:15:22.200 --> 03:15:26.760]  audience at that event we need a ticket you can't get him you know who has the tickets for the i'm
[03:15:26.760 --> 03:15:33.160]  talking about to the television audience donors special interests the people that are putting up
[03:15:33.160 --> 03:15:39.640]  the money who it is the rnc told us we have all donors in the audience and the reason they're not
[03:15:39.640 --> 03:15:45.960]  loving me the reason they're not excuse me the reason they're not loving me is i don't want their
[03:15:45.960 --> 03:15:50.120]  money i'm going to do the right thing for the american public i don't want their money i don't
[03:15:50.120 --> 03:15:55.000]  need their money and i'm the only one up here they can say that eminent domain now here's the key
[03:15:55.000 --> 03:15:59.640]  don't pipeline do you consider that a private job i consider the public you know let me ask you
[03:15:59.640 --> 03:16:05.080]  jeb you consider the keystone pipeline private it's a public it's a public use a real public
[03:16:05.080 --> 03:16:09.880]  use no it's a private job it's a public it's a private by the courts federal state you wouldn't
[03:16:09.880 --> 03:16:15.080]  have no it's not okay let's stop it at that point now what happened with us if you if you
[03:16:15.080 --> 03:16:20.440]  were looking at the the news as drudge had it people were calling for jeb to deliver a knockout
[03:16:20.440 --> 03:16:25.560]  punch to trump so what they did was they handed jeb this hammer they said hit him with eminent domain
[03:16:26.440 --> 03:16:31.960]  jeb being jeb had no idea what he was talking about when he comes in and he defends the keystone
[03:16:31.960 --> 03:16:39.560]  pipeline as being for public use it's not it's private use and the keystone pipeline is i think
[03:16:39.560 --> 03:16:44.920]  the ultimate example because here we're looking at eminent domain that is happening on a national
[03:16:44.920 --> 03:16:50.680]  level jeb bush had talked about how they had set up something in the florida state constitution
[03:16:50.680 --> 03:16:56.840]  to control eminent domain being used being abused by for private use that is the right way to do it
[03:16:56.840 --> 03:17:03.640]  we need to nullify this bad clause in the constitution at the state level fine nevertheless
[03:17:03.640 --> 03:17:09.640]  jeb bush doesn't understand or at least he won't say it that the keystone pipeline is for private
[03:17:09.640 --> 03:17:14.280]  use i guess he doesn't want to offend the coke brothers that he's so desperately trying to get
[03:17:14.280 --> 03:17:20.280]  their their support as a donor they're the ones who are supporting this along with trans canada
[03:17:20.840 --> 03:17:28.680]  and it is absolutely criminal that conservatives would support the taking of private property by
[03:17:28.680 --> 03:17:34.360]  a canadian corporation but of course jeb bush didn't just stop there he continued to go after
[03:17:34.360 --> 03:17:39.480]  donald trump the next day and we've got an article on infowars.com jeb bush says i will not blame
[03:17:39.480 --> 03:17:44.760]  obama for anything as a matter of fact he got a bit of a clause for that they were talking about
[03:17:45.640 --> 03:17:52.280]  how jeb bush is no longer mr nice guy this was an article where they said he's not going to take
[03:17:52.280 --> 03:17:58.360]  it anymore they said his performance is so animated it almost justified the exclamation point in his
[03:17:58.360 --> 03:18:04.120]  logo and they said in front of about 200 people he was yelling and screaming at everybody they
[03:18:04.120 --> 03:18:09.080]  said it was a big difference remember the just a few days ago where he was laying down his talking
[03:18:09.080 --> 03:18:13.800]  points or he was talking about how strong he was going to be his president and then he stopped and
[03:18:13.800 --> 03:18:19.640]  very sheepishly said please clap please clap everybody clap for him well he wasn't doing that
[03:18:19.640 --> 03:18:23.960]  he was exasperated because he is getting at the end of his rope there was one headline that said
[03:18:24.520 --> 03:18:30.520]  the last days of jeb bush's last stand and it could very well be what happens to him in the
[03:18:30.520 --> 03:18:35.400]  aftermath of new hampshire we're going to be covering the new hampshire primary tomorrow night
[03:18:35.400 --> 03:18:39.480]  we're going to be doing it live with the info wars nightly news crew we're going to break it down for
[03:18:39.480 --> 03:18:43.320]  you and one of the key things that's going to come out of that tomorrow night of course we're
[03:18:43.320 --> 03:18:48.040]  seeing the establishment playing expectation games with donald trump saying well if he doesn't
[03:18:48.040 --> 03:18:55.160]  win by an amount that we have predetermined then we're going to pronounce him a loser that's the
[03:18:55.160 --> 03:19:01.800]  kind of expectation games they like to play but of course the reality is is that if the candidates
[03:19:01.800 --> 03:19:07.560]  get less than 10% tomorrow night and that could be somebody like jeb bush all the candidates
[03:19:07.560 --> 03:19:14.360]  who get less than 10% their percentage will be totaled up and that will be given to the winter
[03:19:14.360 --> 03:19:19.000]  here's how this works the npr breaks it down they say look there's 20 delegates at stake in the
[03:19:19.000 --> 03:19:23.640]  new hampshire primary tomorrow night and this is how it could break down if trump gets 31 percent
[03:19:23.640 --> 03:19:30.200]  rubio 16 kcic 12 crews 12 they would get six three two and two delegates each of them would get
[03:19:30.200 --> 03:19:35.960]  delegates based on their uh proportionate but then if you have bush getting nine christy getting
[03:19:35.960 --> 03:19:43.000]  five fiorina getting five karsten getting three you add those up that's 22 percent those 22 percent
[03:19:43.000 --> 03:19:47.480]  of delegates because all of those people were below 10 percent each all of their delegates would
[03:19:47.480 --> 03:19:52.920]  go to the winner who would be donald trump so instead of getting six delegates donald trump
[03:19:52.920 --> 03:19:57.640]  would get 10 now when we come back we're going to take a look at something that i agree with donald
[03:19:57.640 --> 03:20:02.760]  trump on and that is his 19th century foreign policy if you woke up each morning with new vitality

[03:25:39.320 --> 03:25:45.320]  imminent domain the back and forth between jeb bush and donald trump and again jeb bush you
[03:25:45.320 --> 03:25:51.000]  almost feel sorry for him because he's he's so clueless about things he's still using his line
[03:25:51.000 --> 03:25:56.600]  of course about the fact that he did so many line vetoes that they called him veto corleone but he
[03:25:56.600 --> 03:26:02.440]  is really more like frado if you know what i mean okay so when he's talking back and forth with
[03:26:02.440 --> 03:26:08.440]  donald trump when he's attacking him for imminent domain he is absolutely clueless or at least he
[03:26:08.440 --> 03:26:14.840]  won't admit that the keystone pipeline is imminent domain for private use donald trump is aware of
[03:26:14.840 --> 03:26:21.080]  that he supports and i'm sad to say but at least he knows what's going on but there was an article
[03:26:21.080 --> 03:26:24.920]  and i i quoted a little bit of it in the last segment from the daily beast that i thought was
[03:26:24.920 --> 03:26:30.760]  really pretty funny fear the wrath of jeb and they were talking about how frustrated jeb bush got
[03:26:30.760 --> 03:26:35.640]  over the weekend after the debate he was so upset he just wasn't going to take it anymore so he was
[03:26:35.640 --> 03:26:41.560]  yelling and screaming about how he's going to change things and say look i'm not going to blame it
[03:26:41.560 --> 03:26:47.800]  on obama anymore of course we have a an article on info wars dot com from kit daniels talking about
[03:26:47.800 --> 03:26:52.600]  that but then he goes on to donald trump he yells at him he yells at a questioner he yells at a
[03:26:52.600 --> 03:26:56.760]  reporter who's in the room he's going after everybody when he goes after donald trump
[03:26:57.560 --> 03:27:02.680]  he yells and this is a great line from the daily beast they say donald trump you're the loser
[03:27:02.680 --> 03:27:09.240]  concluded jeb with all the energy of a nerdy hormonal student yelling at an absent bully
[03:27:09.240 --> 03:27:18.680]  it seemed cathartic that's basically sums it up that is what jeb bush is a nerdy hormonal student
[03:27:18.680 --> 03:27:23.720]  and he's okay to yell at donald trump and donald trump's not there but as i pointed out in the
[03:27:23.720 --> 03:27:28.360]  last segment and we're going to be covering the new hampshire primaries tomorrow night live
[03:27:28.360 --> 03:27:35.480]  live with info wars nightly news it may be the ultimate irony that if jeb bush doesn't get more
[03:27:35.480 --> 03:27:42.200]  than 10 in the new hampshire primary all of his votes will go to donald trump and the associated
[03:27:42.200 --> 03:27:46.760]  delegates who wouldn't that be wouldn't that be painful he's going to be yelling if that happens
[03:27:46.760 --> 03:27:52.120]  let me tell you one of the things that we need to be concerned about i think is of course jeb
[03:27:52.120 --> 03:28:00.040]  bush likes to portray his open border policy as a policy of love but let me read to you what he
[03:28:00.040 --> 03:28:05.800]  really wants to do he says i have a plan to secure the border through a forward-leaning border patrol
[03:28:05.800 --> 03:28:13.960]  through surveillance technology through mandatory e-verify and other measures so instead of having
[03:28:13.960 --> 03:28:18.600]  an old-fashioned wall at the border which i don't think is really possible to do
[03:28:18.600 --> 03:28:24.040]  and i think it's a mistake to do that you need to address the underlying causes that are causing
[03:28:24.040 --> 03:28:29.480]  people to come over in a way that we don't want them to if people want to come and work and support
[03:28:29.480 --> 03:28:35.960]  themselves we've always had an open border for that kind of immigration in the past and i'm enough
[03:28:35.960 --> 03:28:40.920]  of a libertarian that i would like to see that continue however that is not what is happening
[03:28:40.920 --> 03:28:48.120]  here this is a deliberate open border to export jobs to import workers to take down our countries
[03:28:48.120 --> 03:28:53.080]  not only in america but in europe that's what we see happening what jeb bush would do rather than
[03:28:53.080 --> 03:28:58.600]  build a wall is he would set up an electronic surveillance state he would essentially put us
[03:28:58.600 --> 03:29:05.320]  under house arrest with a an electronic blank uh a bracelet that we wear around the country that's
[03:29:05.320 --> 03:29:11.000]  what e-verify a national id card and these other measures that the republicans have suggested would
[03:29:11.000 --> 03:29:17.560]  do it's essentially going to have you under house arrest or maybe what we could say is white house
[03:29:17.560 --> 03:29:22.280]  arrest because that's what we're going to turn this country into it's going to be a full on
[03:29:22.280 --> 03:29:27.000]  prison if we allow them to do that and yet when people speak out against this like the french
[03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:31.480]  general who used to be the head of the french foreign legion when he speaks out against it in
[03:29:31.480 --> 03:29:37.400]  calais where the immigrants are so out of control what do the french uh what does the french government
[03:29:37.400 --> 03:29:43.960]  do it arrests him it arrests this 75 year old man who can't even stand trial because of his health
[03:29:43.960 --> 03:29:52.840]  issues stay with us we're gonna be right back we're on the march the empires on the run alex jones
[03:29:52.840 --> 03:30:01.880]  and the gcn radio network here's what donald trump must do to finish strong in new hampshire according
[03:30:01.880 --> 03:30:07.800]  to veteran glp strategist roger stone he said quote trump must return to the core issues that put
[03:30:07.800 --> 03:30:13.400]  him way way out front sealing our borders building the wall recharging our economy addressing trade

[03:30:18.360 --> 03:30:23.480]  trump should talk about the trump tax plan praised by supply side guru larry kudrow we know trump is

[03:30:29.160 --> 03:30:34.200]  is very real but trump must dispatch cruises a viable candidate before he can face off with rubio
[03:30:34.200 --> 03:30:38.360]  who will continue to be a factor in the palomado state but rubio may have already taken himself
[03:30:38.360 --> 03:30:42.520]  down considering his robotic performance during saturday's debate in which he used the same
[03:30:42.520 --> 03:30:47.480]  memorized line at least eight times showing he's a free program establishment candidate who can't
[03:30:47.480 --> 03:30:52.120]  speak off the cuff the glp strategist also revealed that credible polls have trump running a substantially

[03:33:30.600 --> 03:33:36.280]  phone calls in just a moment now as we're looking at the debate this last saturday we've talked
[03:33:36.280 --> 03:33:41.560]  about this exchange back and forth between chris christie and marco rubio and we all owe chris christie
[03:33:41.560 --> 03:33:50.040]  a debt of gratitude for exposing the robotic marco rubio also the tactic that he uses typically
[03:33:50.040 --> 03:33:56.360]  you see somebody prepared because they know that a an opponent is going to come up with
[03:33:56.360 --> 03:34:02.120]  a particular talking point so they have pre-prepared a response to it a canned response and those are
[03:34:02.120 --> 03:34:06.120]  okay sometimes but the key thing about this exchange it was different from all others
[03:34:06.120 --> 03:34:12.360]  was that marco rubio did it to himself and he couldn't stop doing it to himself he could not
[03:34:12.360 --> 03:34:18.920]  stop himself from repeating that little 25 second sound bite but when we look at chris christie one
[03:34:18.920 --> 03:34:24.040]  of the things that he was saying was look i'm a governor i'm here to solve people's problems is
[03:34:24.040 --> 03:34:28.440]  is that really is that really the purpose of government i seem to remember ronald reagan
[03:34:28.440 --> 03:34:34.680]  saying government isn't a solution government is the problem and in new jersey one of the biggest
[03:34:34.680 --> 03:34:39.800]  problems with the government is their gun laws what has chris christie done about that well of
[03:34:39.800 --> 03:34:44.520]  course he supported assault weapon bands when he was running for office he supported a lot of gun
[03:34:44.520 --> 03:34:49.720]  control measures i don't know that he's done anything to try to pull that back or to offer any
[03:34:49.720 --> 03:34:54.520]  clemency to people i think we also need to look at what's happening in uh ohio under another
[03:34:54.520 --> 03:34:59.560]  candidate governor casick setting governor in ohio just as chris christie is governor in new
[03:34:59.560 --> 03:35:06.440]  jersey here's a situation where ohio homeschoolers are facing criminal charges because of missing
[03:35:06.440 --> 03:35:12.040]  paperwork this is a wnd story pointing out that authorities in ohio have filed criminal charges
[03:35:12.040 --> 03:35:17.240]  against homeschool parents of two different families they'll have trials later this month
[03:35:17.240 --> 03:35:23.480]  this could result in massive fines and jail time if convicted and why because they missed
[03:35:23.480 --> 03:35:29.160]  paperwork deadlines the parents are facing accusations of quote contributing to the delinquency
[03:35:29.160 --> 03:35:33.800]  of a minor and quote they didn't have their paperwork filed appropriately or on time they're
[03:35:33.800 --> 03:35:37.880]  being defended by the homeschool legal defense association and if you're a homeschooler you
[03:35:37.880 --> 03:35:43.560]  need to get involved with these people they will protect you from this kind of bureaucratic abuse
[03:35:44.280 --> 03:35:48.600]  the governor of ohio evidently won't and this is what they point out in their explanation they say
[03:35:48.600 --> 03:35:53.480]  both families were somewhat new to homeschooling in ohio one family filed a notice of intent when
[03:35:53.480 --> 03:35:57.880]  they began homeschooling last year but they didn't know they had to file another notice for this
[03:35:57.880 --> 03:36:03.000]  school year the other family filed their annual notice of intent but they did not submit an
[03:36:03.000 --> 03:36:07.400]  educational assessment with their notice because they had not yet completed it and have been told
[03:36:07.400 --> 03:36:13.480]  by their school district there wasn't any deadline for submitting the assessment then the hs lda goes
[03:36:13.480 --> 03:36:18.520]  on and says even though both families continued to educate their children their school districts
[03:36:18.520 --> 03:36:25.000]  decided then to treat the children as truants they say unfortunately cases like this are happening in
[03:36:25.000 --> 03:36:29.720]  ohio every few years and they point out that contributing to the delinquency of a minor
[03:36:29.720 --> 03:36:34.920]  is usually used for parents who are abusing the system by aiding or betting their child
[03:36:34.920 --> 03:36:39.640]  in the commission of a crime or a serious offense like obtaining a firearm for example
[03:36:40.440 --> 03:36:46.600]  and here's the key if these parents who simply did not understand some of the paperwork requirements
[03:36:46.600 --> 03:36:53.880]  didn't fill it out on time get it in on time if they are found guilty of this they will face a
[03:36:53.880 --> 03:37:01.000]  a situation of a thousand dollars in fines and up to six months in jail for each day that a child
[03:37:01.000 --> 03:37:08.040]  is truant that is a separate offense so for each day and for each child they could get up to a
[03:37:08.040 --> 03:37:15.160]  thousand dollars in fines and six months in jail does that sound ridiculous how about the epa
[03:37:15.160 --> 03:37:22.280]  coming after that welder in montana who had eight acres and built a stock pond and swimming pool
[03:37:22.280 --> 03:37:27.240]  within his eight acres not going outside of the property cleared it with state and local officials
[03:37:27.240 --> 03:37:32.200]  but the epa came in and said we own all the water in the world and because you didn't get our
[03:37:32.200 --> 03:37:35.960]  permission and we won't give it we're going to find you thirty seven thousand five hundred dollars a
[03:37:35.960 --> 03:37:43.000]  day that's what they did so excessive fines that are prohibited under the constitution are happening
[03:37:43.000 --> 03:37:47.880]  all the time by our government so when you look at this when you look at this atrocity in ohio
[03:37:47.880 --> 03:37:53.560]  when you look at the atrocities of the gun laws in new jersey have to ask yourself where are these
[03:37:53.560 --> 03:37:59.480]  governors who think that they are solving our problems these governors are the problems in
[03:37:59.480 --> 03:38:04.840]  these various states let's go to our callers right now let's go to uh forest and colorado go ahead
[03:38:04.840 --> 03:38:12.760]  forest uh yes sir i've i've been a long time listener first time caller and um i actually
[03:38:12.760 --> 03:38:16.840]  wanted to make a comment i work in the pipeline industry are you are you there yes yes which
[03:38:16.840 --> 03:38:22.200]  industry do you work in i work in the pipeline industry pipeline industry okay go ahead yeah
[03:38:22.200 --> 03:38:26.760]  yes sir and as far as like the imminent domain goes i've worked on construction projects and you
[03:38:26.760 --> 03:38:32.760]  know majority of times i haven't seen people get um in fact at all get pushed off their property and
[03:38:32.760 --> 03:38:38.360]  they don't actually push them off their property they just buy the rights to uh go out onto the
[03:38:38.360 --> 03:38:44.680]  land uh to access the pipeline um i mean it's it's been a good industry that's supported my
[03:38:44.680 --> 03:38:49.560]  family and i haven't seen anything uh you know corrupt as far as that goes well what's happening
[03:38:49.560 --> 03:38:54.280]  with the keystone pipeline and it was reported by multiple outlets that people who had had farms in
[03:38:54.280 --> 03:38:59.720]  many cases over a hundred years and their family uh were being told that they had to that their
[03:38:59.720 --> 03:39:06.120]  property was going to be taken now uh what happened is the keystone pipeline was not signed through
[03:39:06.120 --> 03:39:10.920]  by obama it was interesting that hillary clinton's state department was the main organization that
[03:39:10.920 --> 03:39:16.360]  was pushing the keystone pipeline uh but it has not gone through now all the republicans
[03:39:16.360 --> 03:39:21.560]  have been on top of the keystone pipeline and i think it's interesting that they have voted
[03:39:21.560 --> 03:39:27.320]  this up over 10 times the republicans have voted for the keystone pipeline and it's been vetoed
[03:39:27.320 --> 03:39:34.040]  that many times by obama but they would ignore things like obama care they would ignore things
[03:39:34.040 --> 03:39:38.360]  that they had been elected to do and they would continue to vote over and over again for the
[03:39:38.360 --> 03:39:44.920]  keystone pipeline but but let me ask you if somebody uh did not want to uh turn their property over
[03:39:45.480 --> 03:39:49.240]  in general do you think that a private corporation especially a foreign corporation
[03:39:49.240 --> 03:39:55.720]  should be able to force them off that property i mean at my experience you know i've worked all over
[03:39:55.720 --> 03:40:00.280]  this nation and you know as we're laying lines we go through and do preliminaries and stuff um if
[03:40:00.280 --> 03:40:05.480]  there's a possibility of going through someone's property who doesn't want the pipeline there a
[03:40:05.480 --> 03:40:11.720]  lot of times they reroute around um we do a lot of other stuff to not necessarily um you know
[03:40:12.520 --> 03:40:16.680]  get into their rights their own property rights yeah i would i would agree with that
[03:40:16.680 --> 03:40:20.920]  and i would agree with that even for public use that's why i would like to see it uh tackled
[03:40:20.920 --> 03:40:25.960]  at the state level basically nullifying that typically these things are happening with state
[03:40:25.960 --> 03:40:30.120]  and local government and i think that's really where it should be addressed this became a national
[03:40:30.120 --> 03:40:35.480]  issue because of the keystone pipeline and because of the situations that had happened with donald
[03:40:35.480 --> 03:40:42.280]  trump trying to take a property at a local level uh and you know for use in atlantic city for his
[03:40:42.280 --> 03:40:47.560]  parking lot that he wanted to build uh decided later not to build the parking lot but that
[03:40:47.560 --> 03:40:52.840]  brought it up as a campaign issue for donald trump and of course the supreme court weighed in on
[03:40:52.840 --> 03:40:59.080]  that issue with somebody else in connecticut so that is uh what we're talking about is the private
[03:40:59.080 --> 03:41:04.520]  use of property for another corporation and whether or not there ought to be different uh
[03:41:04.520 --> 03:41:09.000]  different levels for uh people who are well connected and powerful if they ought to have
[03:41:09.000 --> 03:41:13.720]  special property rights that the rest of us don't have i would agree with you i think that if somebody
[03:41:13.720 --> 03:41:19.720]  has a pipeline uh that they want to run through and people are agree that they want to do that i
[03:41:19.720 --> 03:41:23.720]  would certainly sell them the rights to come through my property i would think but if they want to
[03:41:23.720 --> 03:41:28.600]  take the entire property not give me a choice in doing that i would oppose that and i agree with
[03:41:28.600 --> 03:41:33.640]  you i think they should be able to route this around somebody's property just as in china
[03:41:34.200 --> 03:41:39.080]  they build the roads around somebody's house if the house of the people who own the property do
[03:41:39.080 --> 03:41:43.080]  not want to sell that property i think that's the real key if we don't here's the bottom line
[03:41:43.720 --> 03:41:50.280]  if we don't have private property we are the property you understand that's a fundamental
[03:41:50.280 --> 03:41:55.800]  right that separates you from being a slave the ability to own property and it goes even beyond
[03:41:55.800 --> 03:42:01.400]  imminent domain it goes to the fact that i think we ought to start looking at repealing uh property
[03:42:01.400 --> 03:42:07.880]  taxes because that is a long-term rental situation you're having to pay rent to the government for
[03:42:07.880 --> 03:42:11.880]  as long as you're there and they try to give abatement to people as they retire as they get
[03:42:11.880 --> 03:42:18.440]  on to a fixed income but still it typically forces people out of their homes as they are older because
[03:42:18.440 --> 03:42:22.840]  they cannot afford the property taxes the property taxes are going to continue to go up as we see
[03:42:22.840 --> 03:42:29.080]  inflation and property taxes are going to skyrocket if we don't do something about controlling the
[03:42:29.080 --> 03:42:33.880]  borders if we have open borders and everyone in the world is allowed to come here and get a free
[03:42:33.880 --> 03:42:39.960]  education all the way up through college as hillary and bernie sanders uh want to do then
[03:42:39.960 --> 03:42:44.760]  basically you're not going to be able to afford to live in any home you're going to be pushed out
[03:42:44.760 --> 03:42:49.640]  of that just for the property taxes alone uh thank you for us let's go to ronnie and texas ronnie go
[03:42:49.640 --> 03:42:59.240]  ahead thank well thank you sir yes i'm calling uh about jeb open open borders jeb and i'm just
[03:42:59.240 --> 03:43:07.320]  saying no and i'm saying yes to donald trump and of course our great governor abat and it turns out
[03:43:07.320 --> 03:43:13.240]  my absentee ballot has been denied to me i'm disabled i i had an absentee ballot and then they just
[03:43:14.040 --> 03:43:17.480]  quit sending them to me and i'm having a real hard time finding out who to call
[03:43:17.480 --> 03:43:23.560]  call how to get back on the list because i'm a lifelong political activist and it really deserves
[03:43:23.560 --> 03:43:28.360]  me then i'll be able to vote yeah i understand crucial well you know what what's interesting
[03:43:28.360 --> 03:43:32.600]  you mentioned governor abat i think it was interesting that he was joined by henry quaylar
[03:43:32.600 --> 03:43:38.360]  who was a democrat congressman talking about their concerns about the border i heard this
[03:43:38.360 --> 03:43:42.760]  reported on npr and they were talking to the democrat and said well you know it's actually
[03:43:42.760 --> 03:43:48.040]  declined from last month to this month and he goes no if you look at it for a four month period
[03:43:48.040 --> 03:43:54.440]  this year versus last year it's up 170 percent and he says so why is it that our border patrol
[03:43:54.440 --> 03:43:59.560]  is being reduced by 50 percent we don't understand what's going on i gotta tell you i was gone the
[03:43:59.560 --> 03:44:05.800]  last two days uh last week i went down to uh big bend i've never been there before uh down at the
[03:44:05.800 --> 03:44:11.560]  southern texas it's a large national park right at the border as we were walking through the park
[03:44:11.560 --> 03:44:16.920]  we saw people that were from mexico bringing their goods to sell just over the border just
[03:44:16.920 --> 03:44:21.400]  walking over that very narrow very shallow river that's there the rio grand that's running through
[03:44:21.400 --> 03:44:25.720]  that particular park they would bring over little trinkets and they put them there on an honor system
[03:44:25.720 --> 03:44:30.120]  saying if you want to buy this jewelry you can leave some cash here as we continue to walk along
[03:44:30.120 --> 03:44:36.840]  the rio grand uh there was a mexican on the other side singing music to us and he had his tip jar
[03:44:36.840 --> 03:44:40.520]  on the american side they're going back and forth and i'm looking at this as like there's no way
[03:44:40.520 --> 03:44:46.040]  you're going to uh build a wall here but of course there weren't any border patrol agents
[03:44:46.040 --> 03:44:50.600]  that were there where we saw border patrol interestingly enough was after we got out of
[03:44:50.600 --> 03:44:59.000]  this vast park we went 40 miles north of the park and there is a permanent border patrol station
[03:44:59.000 --> 03:45:05.000]  there and we had to stop and they asked us if we're american citizens and we said yeah and i said
[03:45:05.000 --> 03:45:09.880]  are we at the border and she said no and i said well you're doing a great job of patrolling
[03:45:09.880 --> 03:45:15.880]  the border aren't you it's absolutely absurd this is nothing but theater and this is what they're
[03:45:15.880 --> 03:45:21.160]  going to do they're going to use all of these border control methods against us whether it's
[03:45:21.160 --> 03:45:26.920]  going to be e-verify national id cards that jeb bush and the rest of republicans are supporting
[03:45:26.920 --> 03:45:31.640]  that's going to be used against american citizens just like we see the security theater at the
[03:45:31.640 --> 03:45:36.840]  airports just like we see the security theater by the border patrol setting up these permanent
[03:45:36.840 --> 03:45:44.280]  stations 100 miles into the country asking people if you're a citizen or not but that's all they do
[03:45:44.280 --> 03:45:49.480]  and then they let you go it's absolute nonsense they're totally absent from the border they're
[03:45:49.480 --> 03:45:54.680]  not doing anything at all to control the border and we look at this and we and we look at this
[03:45:54.680 --> 03:46:00.440]  thank you ronnie i want to talk a little bit about what uh richard reeves report when he
[03:46:00.440 --> 03:46:05.880]  talked to marco rubio because when he talked to marco rubio about tpp and i think this is a key issue
[03:46:05.880 --> 03:46:13.800]  because i think this is one of the few issues that uh only donald trump is on the right side
[03:46:13.800 --> 03:46:19.160]  of this is i think it's one of the major issues that is uh before us at this point in time because
[03:46:19.160 --> 03:46:25.800]  this is about our national sovereignty as richard reed uh pointed out about this now when he talked
[03:46:25.800 --> 03:46:32.200]  to uh marco rubio rubio said i'm a supporter of free trade and he said that in the context of the
[03:46:32.200 --> 03:46:38.840]  tpp let me explain to you just as ron paul said years ago when they did nafta and it was a thousand
[03:46:38.840 --> 03:46:45.240]  pages then he said you don't need a thousand pages to have free trade you just say we're
[03:46:45.240 --> 03:46:50.520]  going to have free trade if you have a thousand pages and now we've got five thousand pages rubio
[03:46:50.520 --> 03:46:55.800]  admitted that he said he wasn't going to read it he was going to wait and listen to what the
[03:46:55.800 --> 03:47:00.120]  itc the international trade commission told him very much like what you hear ben carson say all
[03:47:00.120 --> 03:47:04.760]  the time when anybody asked ben carson a question about policy he dodges it and says well i'm going
[03:47:04.760 --> 03:47:08.680]  to ask the experts what they say and then i'm going to go with their recommendation so that's
[03:47:08.680 --> 03:47:14.440]  essentially what uh marco the robot said he said i'm going to wait for the bureaucracy the itc to
[03:47:14.440 --> 03:47:18.360]  tell me if this is a good deal or not i'm not going to read it it's five thousand pages i can't read
[03:47:18.360 --> 03:47:22.680]  it so i'm going to rely on their judgment and then i'll decide on whether or not i'm going to vote for
[03:47:22.680 --> 03:47:29.800]  him he's not talking about free trade when you've got five thousand pages that's managed trade
[03:47:30.520 --> 03:47:36.920]  understand the difference it's not free trade it's managed trade and the trade is being managed
[03:47:36.920 --> 03:47:43.480]  by a multinational commission once this commission is set up and established as senator sessions
[03:47:43.480 --> 03:47:48.520]  pointed out he's one of the only senators who actually took the time to look at the agreement
[03:47:48.520 --> 03:47:54.200]  unlike marco rubio and the rest of them when he looked at it he said this is setting up essentially
[03:47:54.200 --> 03:47:58.840]  a living agreement in other words it's not going to be a concrete agreement when you vote for these
[03:47:58.840 --> 03:48:04.360]  five thousand pages of managed trade managed by these multinational corporations who created it
[03:48:04.360 --> 03:48:08.520]  in secret with their lobbyists once you vote on that that's not what you're going to get
[03:48:09.320 --> 03:48:15.000]  it creates a multinational commission that commission will be able to change that agreement
[03:48:15.000 --> 03:48:20.680]  at will and what they will be doing is they'll be managing your economy they'll be managing
[03:48:20.680 --> 03:48:26.600]  your economy by adjusting the tariffs going in and out on this property or on that type of
[03:48:26.600 --> 03:48:34.280]  a product that is what we're signing up for so when trey gowdy who had endorsed marco rubio and
[03:48:34.280 --> 03:48:38.680]  and richard reeves goes to him and asks him about that he says oh look you know he didn't vote for
[03:48:38.680 --> 03:48:45.960]  the tpp he voted for the trade promotion authorization well that's a problem right there because under
[03:48:45.960 --> 03:48:50.520]  our constitution a treaty and this is a treaty would you call it a partnership agreement would
[03:48:50.520 --> 03:48:57.560]  you call it a trade agreement it is a treaty an understanding about economic issues between
[03:48:57.560 --> 03:49:02.200]  several nations is a treaty and they're even talking about how they're not going even though
[03:49:02.200 --> 03:49:07.160]  they're having the signing they had the signing last week they're not going to ratify it for
[03:49:07.160 --> 03:49:14.040]  some time it is a treaty but the senate and the congress people like marco rubio and trey gowdy
[03:49:14.680 --> 03:49:19.800]  voted to ignore the constitutional requirements they voted to allow this
[03:49:20.840 --> 03:49:26.280]  treaty that was created by corporate lobbyists in secret they allowed this to have a straight
[03:49:26.280 --> 03:49:31.160]  up and down vote over a short period of time without any amendments without any kind of
[03:49:31.160 --> 03:49:38.920]  uh debate on the floor about this that is the issue they are exporting jobs and they're importing
[03:49:38.920 --> 03:49:43.240]  workers with the open borders we've got this article from the drudge report ford is going to
[03:49:43.240 --> 03:49:50.360]  more than double its mexican production capacity by 2018 this is what we see we see jobs being
[03:49:50.360 --> 03:49:57.160]  exported as they are importing workers and now i find it interesting that even congress is trying
[03:49:57.160 --> 03:50:04.920]  to outsource their jobs congress people like trey gowdy and marco rubio are outsourcing their job
[03:50:04.920 --> 03:50:10.680]  to a foreign multinational commission that will be unanswerable to us that will be setting there
[03:50:10.680 --> 03:50:16.600]  managing our trade going back and forth and this i think is a very strong point for donald trump
[03:50:16.600 --> 03:50:22.600]  there was an article from politico back on january the 20th trump's 19th century foreign policy now
[03:50:22.600 --> 03:50:26.520]  this is written by a guy from the brickings institute he disagrees with donald trump but
[03:50:26.520 --> 03:50:31.800]  he makes the point that trump has held the viewpoints that he's had here for a very long time even
[03:50:31.800 --> 03:50:39.800]  going back to 1987 he took out a hundred thousand dollar full page ad in the new york times to talk
[03:50:39.800 --> 03:50:46.280]  about how our trade policy was destroying our country and not only that but our agreements
[03:50:46.280 --> 03:50:50.680]  our mutual defense agreements how they were also destroying our country stay with us we'll be right

[03:54:13.160 --> 03:54:17.720]  central apm eastern we're going to continue to talk about donald trump's form policy i think it's
[03:54:17.720 --> 03:54:23.960]  very interesting that he's held these views that he's putting out for over 30 years he took out a
[03:54:23.960 --> 03:54:29.960]  hundred thousand dollar full page ad in the new york times to talk about how deeply unhappy he was
[03:54:29.960 --> 03:54:34.280]  with america's military alliances he feels the u.s is over committed around the world he feels
[03:54:34.280 --> 03:54:40.280]  america is disadvantaged by the global economy that's very true he's saying the exactly the same
[03:54:40.280 --> 03:54:44.840]  thing i find it very interesting that this person from the brookings institute who disagrees with
[03:54:44.840 --> 03:54:51.320]  trump on foreign policy on trade policy points out that he's been consistent for 30 years he's
[03:54:51.320 --> 03:54:54.760]  been talking about this issue and i think it's a very important issue i don't think there's
[03:54:54.760 --> 03:55:01.080]  anybody who is effectively going to stop the tpp other than donald trump and so uh we're
[03:55:01.080 --> 03:55:04.920]  going to talk about that in detail tonight i want to get back to our phone calls but before i do

[03:55:56.040 --> 03:56:03.080]  about imminent domain uh let's go to barry and arizona go ahead barry i did it's a pleasure to speak
[03:56:03.080 --> 03:56:06.840]  with you just want to let you know that i look through you a lot and i know you have a very
[03:56:06.840 --> 03:56:12.200]  analytical mind that tends to organize information very efficiently so i want to give you some
[03:56:12.200 --> 03:56:16.680]  information about imminent domain and i'll also touch on it quickly if i can to still
[03:56:16.680 --> 03:56:22.040]  still ask that forfeiture but i don't know what the term constitutional construction
[03:56:22.840 --> 03:56:27.800]  no i'm not familiar with that term go ahead okay uh it's the legal term that means how you
[03:56:27.800 --> 03:56:33.800]  interpret a law okay because the word construction comes from the word construe right okay so
[03:56:33.800 --> 03:56:38.760]  the number one rule of constitutional construction is that you cannot interpret a
[03:56:38.760 --> 03:56:43.720]  provision of constitution to mean anything different than what the guy who wrote it meant
[03:56:43.720 --> 03:56:47.640]  when he wrote it yeah you're talking about an originalist view of the constitution
[03:56:48.760 --> 03:56:52.520]  which is to look at the original meaning of the words to go back to the original definitions
[03:56:52.520 --> 03:56:55.880]  whether we're talking about militia whether talking about natural born citizen that type
[03:56:55.880 --> 03:57:02.040]  of thing go ahead this right the the founders intended to be interpreted according to their
[03:57:02.040 --> 03:57:07.640]  original um provision the way they wrote them so the term imminent domain if you go read the
[03:57:07.640 --> 03:57:12.600]  constitution does not appear anywhere in the constitution people point to the fifth amendment
[03:57:12.600 --> 03:57:18.600]  so-called and the public takings clause and they call that the imminent domain provision it's not
[03:57:19.880 --> 03:57:26.280]  if you look at every provision before the public takings clause it has to do specifically with
[03:57:26.280 --> 03:57:32.120]  people that have been charged and or convicted of crime and that public taking clause is no
[03:57:32.120 --> 03:57:38.760]  different and this is a guarantee i promise you this okay what it was meant to do was to keep
[03:57:38.760 --> 03:57:45.960]  government from you know enacting and enforcing criminal legislation so that they could enrich
[03:57:45.960 --> 03:57:50.520]  themselves but by charging someone punishing them and then taking their property install that for
[03:57:50.520 --> 03:57:54.040]  their own benefit or oh kind like we say the federal government doing all the time with
[03:57:54.040 --> 03:58:00.840]  a civil asset forfeiture yeah and that's and that's the key thing is that we need to understand
[03:58:00.840 --> 03:58:05.720]  and we need to drill this in thank you but i'll take a look at that i'll that's a novel interpretation
[03:58:05.720 --> 03:58:10.040]  of that that i've not considered before but we need to understand that when it comes to things
[03:58:10.040 --> 03:58:15.480]  like the war on drugs when it comes to gun prohibition we see both liberals and conservatives
[03:58:15.480 --> 03:58:21.960]  will allow the government to do anything to stop what they hate that's that fear that we need to
[03:58:21.960 --> 03:58:26.120]  step back from we need to understand that the most important thing the thing that government was
[03:58:26.120 --> 03:58:30.920]  created for was to protect our individual liberties and the rule of law join us tonight
[03:58:30.920 --> 03:58:54.840]  for the info wars nightly news seven central eight p.m. eastern
