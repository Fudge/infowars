[00:00:04.983 --> 00:00:09.806]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.806 --> 00:00:11.407]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.407 --> 00:00:12.948]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.948 --> 00:00:17.131]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.131 --> 00:00:21.213]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:26.383 --> 00:00:28.385]  All right, welcome to the broadcast.
[00:00:28.385 --> 00:00:30.067]  Welcome to the Alex Jones Show.
[00:00:30.067 --> 00:00:35.614]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger, filling in for Alex today on this Friday, March 1st.
[00:00:35.614 --> 00:00:38.257]  Yes, we've entered March of 2013.
[00:00:38.257 --> 00:00:43.583]  That reminds me, let's see, Max Keiser's got his prediction coming up in April.
[00:00:44.524 --> 00:00:48.688]  Of a major economic event.
[00:00:48.688 --> 00:00:50.390]  So I'm kind of curious to see if that's happening.
[00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.234]  We tick one month closer to that today being March 1st.
[00:00:55.234 --> 00:00:57.676]  So we've got a lot of news today.
[00:00:57.676 --> 00:01:01.219]  We've got mine melds of rats.
[00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:03.201]  Something straight out of science fiction.
[00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:07.124]  They're actually merging the mines of two rats in the laboratory and creating a
[00:01:08.243 --> 00:01:11.145]  I don't know, a dual mind machine.
[00:01:11.145 --> 00:01:15.228]  And obviously, you know, everything they do to rats, they're going to eventually do to you.
[00:01:15.228 --> 00:01:23.273]  So, they're going to have human experiments before long once they figure out how this can serve the globalist agenda.
[00:01:23.273 --> 00:01:26.876]  We're going to be covering that, but let me tell you what's really coming up today.
[00:01:26.876 --> 00:01:29.237]  We've got a lot of big news.
[00:01:29.237 --> 00:01:33.380]  At the bottom of this hour, we have Joe Dixon joining us from Morningland Dairy.
[00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.041]  They were rated
[00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:36.462]  I believe at gunpoint.
[00:01:36.462 --> 00:01:38.985]  We're going to get to the bottom of those details.
[00:01:38.985 --> 00:01:41.268]  In Missouri, that raid happened.
[00:01:41.268 --> 00:01:44.893]  The raid actually happened a while back, but there have been a lot of developments in that.
[00:01:44.893 --> 00:01:46.796]  Raw Milk is back on the scene again because
[00:01:47.774 --> 00:01:58.157]  See, when you get into the whole Second Amendment and the gun rights debate, you have to look at, well, what does government do when it has a monopoly on guns?
[00:01:58.157 --> 00:02:14.022]  And if you look at the actual history, recent history, you know, just the last couple of years, it turns out that when government has guns, it uses them to intimidate and raid raw milk farmers, you know, people selling milk.
[00:02:14.022 --> 00:02:16.003]  You know, James Stewart was raided at gunpoint.
[00:02:17.582 --> 00:02:24.848]  And Joe Dixon here, his farm was raided and temporarily shut down and they've gone after him and many others.
[00:02:24.848 --> 00:02:31.954]  So this is a food freedom issue as well as a gun rights issue all together.
[00:02:31.954 --> 00:02:33.435]  And so we're going to be covering that in more detail.
[00:02:33.435 --> 00:02:36.058]  We've also got coming up a little bit later today
[00:02:36.778 --> 00:03:02.902]  Ashel Eldridge, also known as Seasons, he is the rap artist who has created an amazing new music video and song, kind of like a mini-movie actually, a mini-drama, called Food Fight, that is all about inner-city citizens being killed by processed food, being killed by the GMO, by the aspartame, by the processed sugars, and how they can actually take back
[00:03:03.462 --> 00:03:09.203]  Their justice, their rights, their humanity by turning to nutrition and real foods.
[00:03:09.203 --> 00:03:12.104]  And it's a very powerful, inspiring message.
[00:03:12.104 --> 00:03:17.125]  And it's coming out of the inner city rap culture.
[00:03:17.125 --> 00:03:20.866]  And it's a powerful video that's already gone viral across the internet.
[00:03:20.866 --> 00:03:22.006]  So we're going to cover that here.
[00:03:22.006 --> 00:03:28.648]  We've got the creator of that, Seasons, right here on the show with us today to give us more details on that.
[00:03:29.548 --> 00:03:39.752]  This is also part of the resistance, the rising resistance of people who are waking up all across America, across all cultures, across all racial lines.
[00:03:39.752 --> 00:03:48.495]  And this individual sees as he is African American, and I think that's very important for us to acknowledge how
[00:03:49.435 --> 00:03:52.776]  It's every culture that is waking up against the machine.
[00:03:52.776 --> 00:03:57.737]  You see, the system wants us to fight among black and white, Latino.
[00:03:57.737 --> 00:03:59.358]  They want us to fight with each other.
[00:03:59.358 --> 00:04:01.658]  That's why they engage in so much race baiting.
[00:04:01.658 --> 00:04:03.799]  They're trying to create a racial war.
[00:04:03.799 --> 00:04:10.361]  What we need to have, folks, is racial unity against the system of fascist corporate control.
[00:04:10.361 --> 00:04:15.082]  And this song creator, this artist, Seasons, is doing exactly that.
[00:04:15.882 --> 00:04:18.365]  And so that's why we're going to have him on today to talk about that.
[00:04:18.365 --> 00:04:21.628]  It's about the people versus the system.
[00:04:21.628 --> 00:04:22.769]  The system of corruption.
[00:04:22.769 --> 00:04:27.894]  The system of communist, fascist control.
[00:04:27.894 --> 00:04:29.055]  That's what it's really about.
[00:04:29.055 --> 00:04:30.937]  People versus oppression.
[00:04:32.398 --> 00:04:33.779]  Not about black versus white.
[00:04:33.779 --> 00:04:35.721]  So anyway, that's coming up.
[00:04:35.721 --> 00:04:44.510]  Then we've got more news on how criminals do not have to comply with gun control laws according to the Supreme Court.
[00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:48.314]  That's coming up and much more straight ahead, so stay with us here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:04:48.314 --> 00:04:49.956]  We'll be right back with all that and much more.
[00:05:00.211 --> 00:05:03.233]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[00:05:03.233 --> 00:05:08.236]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[00:05:08.236 --> 00:05:15.420]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:21.206]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[00:05:21.206 --> 00:05:25.231]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[00:05:25.231 --> 00:05:29.956]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[00:05:29.956 --> 00:05:35.182]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[00:05:35.422 --> 00:05:38.645]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.

[00:08:05.553 --> 00:08:06.914]  Hitler took the guns.
[00:08:06.914 --> 00:08:12.756]  Stalin took the guns.
[00:08:12.756 --> 00:08:17.938]  Mao took the guns.
[00:08:17.938 --> 00:08:20.118]  Fidel Castro took the guns.
[00:08:20.118 --> 00:08:21.279]  Hugo Chavez took the guns.
[00:08:36.301 --> 00:08:41.747]  1776 will commence again if you try to take our firearms!

[00:08:46.853 --> 00:08:51.799]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against
[00:08:58.376 --> 00:08:59.297]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[00:08:59.297 --> 00:09:01.679]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:13.701]  Alright, it is Friday here on the Alex Jones Show, March 1st, 2013.
[00:09:13.701 --> 00:09:24.723]  Thank you for joining us, and for the next three hours, we're going to be pounding your head with news that will blow your mind, including this one, mind melds of rats.
[00:09:24.723 --> 00:09:37.726]  Oh, by the way, well before I get to that, so we've got a couple of guests coming up, and in the third hour, we're going to be airing an interview between Alex Jones and, what's the rap artist's name, guys?
[00:09:37.726 --> 00:09:38.986]  Immortal Technique, yeah.
[00:09:40.253 --> 00:09:42.275]  Yeah, moral technique.
[00:09:42.275 --> 00:09:55.167]  I saw a bit of that in a previous interview that Alex did with him, but he's got, I don't know, a more condensed version, a more powerful version coming in the third hour today, so don't miss that.
[00:09:55.167 --> 00:09:59.210]  But anyway, we've got a lot of breaking news today, including this.
[00:09:59.210 --> 00:10:02.073]  Mind melds of rats.
[00:10:02.073 --> 00:10:04.575]  This is published in the journal Scientific Reports.
[00:10:05.456 --> 00:10:15.481]  They've established direct brain-to-brain communication between rats to have the rats solve problems together that they couldn't do alone.
[00:10:15.481 --> 00:10:17.162]  Yeah, right.
[00:10:17.162 --> 00:10:18.943]  It takes a village.
[00:10:18.943 --> 00:10:25.366]  And now they're going to have brain-to-brain communication between monkeys that's already being studied and before long, they're going to have it in humans.
[00:10:25.366 --> 00:10:30.428]  It's going to be like the Vulcan mind meld for the globalist agenda.
[00:10:30.428 --> 00:10:31.709]  They're probably going to merge.
[00:10:31.709 --> 00:10:33.550]  Can you imagine if they merge the brain of like
[00:10:34.170 --> 00:10:36.531]  Henry Kissinger and Hillary Clinton?
[00:10:36.531 --> 00:10:38.151]  What would that be like?
[00:10:38.151 --> 00:10:41.953]  What kind of a horror would that create?
[00:10:41.953 --> 00:10:46.554]  Or how about the brain of Dianne Feinstein?
[00:10:46.554 --> 00:10:51.456]  Who would be a good one to merge Dianne Feinstein with?
[00:10:56.499 --> 00:10:57.800]  No.
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.681]  How about Obama?
[00:10:59.681 --> 00:11:00.321]  There you go.
[00:11:00.321 --> 00:11:02.743]  But aren't they pretty much the same brain already?
[00:11:02.743 --> 00:11:04.964]  It's all one big brain.
[00:11:04.964 --> 00:11:06.585]  They all have the same ideas.
[00:11:06.585 --> 00:11:08.526]  They don't have unique thoughts at all.
[00:11:08.526 --> 00:11:13.409]  It's just one hive mind, anyway, running the entire Democratic Party, it seems anyway.
[00:11:13.409 --> 00:11:16.471]  So I don't know what they're going to accomplish by connecting their brains.
[00:11:16.471 --> 00:11:20.034]  But anyway, this is just another example of the crazy science that's going on.
[00:11:21.104 --> 00:11:34.513]  And they talk about it how, oh, they're going to help severely paralyzed people, but really that's just a cover story because what they're really going to do is use this technology like they've used every other technology to build an army of robots.
[00:11:34.513 --> 00:11:40.478]  An army of armed robots and drones that have weapons that can then attack you.
[00:11:40.478 --> 00:11:43.039]  And right now, oh, by the way, that that story is
[00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:52.425]  I'm sorry, the drone story is up on InfoWars.com right now by Steve Watson, so check that out at InfoWars.com.
[00:11:52.425 --> 00:11:56.467]  Oh, I'm sorry, this is a story from last year, but it's relevant.
[00:11:56.467 --> 00:12:04.252]  We are witnessing the beginning of the industrial revolution of war with artificial intelligence type of brains inside the drones.
[00:12:04.952 --> 00:12:11.154]  That are now, of course, legally able to assassinate American citizens on U.S.
[00:12:11.154 --> 00:12:16.877]  soil, thanks to that 16-page Department of Justice memo that was recently issued.
[00:12:16.877 --> 00:12:23.339]  And Obama has so far refused to say, we will rule out any strikes on U.S.
[00:12:23.339 --> 00:12:23.919]  soil.
[00:12:23.919 --> 00:12:25.200]  So that's on the map.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:26.300]  You got that?
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:28.380]  America is the battleground.
[00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:30.801]  The drones are already out there.
[00:12:30.801 --> 00:12:33.301]  The drones have weapons, obviously.
[00:12:33.301 --> 00:12:35.602]  They are striking Americans.
[00:12:35.602 --> 00:12:38.622]  Obama has his secret kill list where he can kill Americans.
[00:12:38.622 --> 00:12:43.563]  And now they're working on the brains of mice and monkeys.
[00:12:43.563 --> 00:12:49.524]  I bet you what we're going to actually see is we're going to have a flying monkey brain in the drone.
[00:12:49.524 --> 00:12:52.545]  It's going to be like something right out of Wizard of Oz.
[00:12:52.545 --> 00:12:54.565]  Like flying gargoyle monkey creatures.
[00:12:55.425 --> 00:13:01.828]  In the Pentagon drone program, and they get a cookie if they hit the target.
[00:13:01.828 --> 00:13:04.349]  Like little kamikaze monkey brains.
[00:13:04.349 --> 00:13:05.350]  That's where this is all heading.
[00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.951]  I know it sounds crazy, but that's where it's heading.
[00:13:07.951 --> 00:13:13.854]  Because here's another story from 2012 that was also written by Paul Joseph Watson.
[00:13:15.049 --> 00:13:19.551]  The new DARPA robot can autonomously track people.
[00:13:19.551 --> 00:13:22.292]  And do we have a video clip of that robot?
[00:13:22.292 --> 00:13:26.294]  That is the DARPA-legged squad support system.
[00:13:26.294 --> 00:13:28.254]  That's a scary-looking thing.
[00:13:28.254 --> 00:13:31.376]  That thing, it chases people through the forest.
[00:13:31.376 --> 00:13:34.937]  Yeah, for those of you watching on PrisonPlanet.tv, we're running that video.
[00:13:34.937 --> 00:13:44.541]  It's got this Boston Dynamics hydraulic four-legged creature marching through the woods, carrying a payload, and tracking humans.
[00:13:47.398 --> 00:13:48.279]  Yeah.
[00:13:48.279 --> 00:14:03.629]  And, you know, of course, when Alex was here saying, let's say, five years ago that they're going to build an army of robots to come after you, they're going to have an army of drones in the skies firing missiles at American citizens, he was called crazy.
[00:14:03.629 --> 00:14:05.010]  No, that can't be.
[00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.911]  There can't be drones coming after American citizens.
[00:14:06.911 --> 00:14:08.472]  There can't be robots.
[00:14:08.472 --> 00:14:09.533]  There are no Terminators.
[00:14:10.359 --> 00:14:20.223]  Well, once again, Alex is owed a massive apology by the establishment because, again, he was ahead of his time in predicting that.
[00:14:20.223 --> 00:14:27.827]  You know, I noticed that if you're, let's say, a month ahead in your predictions, you're considered a genius.
[00:14:27.827 --> 00:14:32.569]  If you're five years ahead, you're considered a kook.
[00:14:32.569 --> 00:14:36.870]  So it's just because the population hasn't caught up yet.
[00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:37.351]  So there you go.
[00:14:38.707 --> 00:14:44.289]  DARPA enlists makers of Big Dog Robot, which we just showed there, to construct machines that can think for themselves.
[00:14:44.289 --> 00:14:47.310]  This is a story by Steve Watson, also from last year.
[00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:50.470]  Machines that can think for themselves.
[00:14:50.470 --> 00:14:57.092]  And of course it's being pushed as a way to perform evacuation operations.
[00:14:57.092 --> 00:15:05.375]  Yeah, they never want to talk about how they're going to mount .50 caliber guns on these robots and go after American citizens.
[00:15:06.275 --> 00:15:08.377]  And civilians living in U.S.
[00:15:08.377 --> 00:15:13.741]  cities after they declare martial law following the economic collapse.
[00:15:13.741 --> 00:15:14.802]  Wow.
[00:15:14.802 --> 00:15:21.067]  They were just showing a video there where you even, you try to kick over the robot, and it recovers and stands up.
[00:15:21.067 --> 00:15:21.947]  It stays standing.
[00:15:21.947 --> 00:15:22.908]  You can't even kick it over.
[00:15:22.908 --> 00:15:27.812]  That thing looks like a giant spider creature.
[00:15:27.812 --> 00:15:31.535]  They've got it walking on water, slippery water, and it's recovering.
[00:15:31.535 --> 00:15:32.415]  That is scary, man.
[00:15:32.415 --> 00:15:32.996]  That is freaky.
[00:15:34.212 --> 00:15:35.212]  That is freaky.
[00:15:35.212 --> 00:15:44.474]  But speaking of .50 calibers, by the way, oh man, my head is still ringing today.
[00:15:44.474 --> 00:15:59.797]  Yesterday, Alex invited me to go out shooting with him and Shane Steiner, and we had three Barrett .50 caliber BMGs and two .338 Lapua rifles all lined up
[00:16:01.258 --> 00:16:04.401]  And we decided to shoot this piece of I-beam that I have here in the studio.
[00:16:04.401 --> 00:16:07.803]  I don't know if you can give a shot of this I-beam over here.
[00:16:07.803 --> 00:16:17.871]  This thing got mangled because somebody brought some armor-piercing ammo with some white... I guess it was some kind of phosphorous coating or something.
[00:16:17.871 --> 00:16:19.713]  Can you show this I-beam?
[00:16:19.713 --> 00:16:21.114]  Yeah, look at this.
[00:16:21.114 --> 00:16:21.754]  So this is a...
[00:16:23.339 --> 00:16:28.423]  Man, that's at least a three-eighths inch thick piece of metal.
[00:16:28.423 --> 00:16:29.523]  Probably a lot more.
[00:16:29.523 --> 00:16:34.427]  Yeah, it looks like about three-eighths.
[00:16:34.427 --> 00:16:36.929]  And it's a big I-beam.
[00:16:36.929 --> 00:16:37.309]  Well, here.
[00:16:37.309 --> 00:16:39.931]  Hang on here.
[00:16:39.931 --> 00:16:41.212]  Hear that?
[00:16:41.212 --> 00:16:42.613]  That's the metal we're talking about.
[00:16:42.613 --> 00:16:44.054]  That's what we were shooting at yesterday.
[00:16:45.738 --> 00:16:50.242]  And it's still ringing, either that or my head is still ringing, I can't tell.
[00:16:50.242 --> 00:16:52.524]  My head was ringing when I woke up this morning, that's for sure.
[00:16:52.524 --> 00:16:58.429]  It's got holes, just massive holes, blown through it, pieces of metal torn out of it.
[00:16:58.429 --> 00:17:01.512]  We must have hit this thing at least 50 times.
[00:17:01.512 --> 00:17:08.478]  I'm telling you, I think we shot a couple thousand dollars worth of 50 cal ammo yesterday.
[00:17:08.478 --> 00:17:12.721]  And the reason my head is ringing is because we lined up, all three of us,
[00:17:13.772 --> 00:17:17.936]  They're on the ground about, I don't know, 400, 450 yards away from the target.
[00:17:17.936 --> 00:17:22.700]  And I was stupid enough to be the guy in the middle.
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:26.543]  That's not a... Of all the positions to be in when you're firing 350 cals,
[00:17:28.650 --> 00:17:31.931]  Being in the middle is the worst position of all.
[00:17:31.931 --> 00:17:36.133]  It's sort of like being attacked by concussion grenades on all sides.
[00:17:36.133 --> 00:17:40.654]  And so I would get blasted by Shane's rifle.
[00:17:40.654 --> 00:17:42.635]  And then I get blasted by Alex's rifle.
[00:17:42.635 --> 00:17:44.916]  And Alex, of course, was engaged in rapid fire.
[00:17:44.916 --> 00:17:46.116]  Boom, boom, boom.
[00:17:46.116 --> 00:17:48.417]  And then I would fire off a shot of my own.
[00:17:48.417 --> 00:17:52.558]  And then all the grass and dust would blow up in my face before I could recover.
[00:17:52.558 --> 00:17:55.599]  Alex was blasting off another couple of rounds.
[00:17:55.599 --> 00:17:57.240]  And I was sucking in all this grass.
[00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:59.321]  Off the ground.
[00:17:59.321 --> 00:18:00.581]  They were elevated.
[00:18:00.581 --> 00:18:12.488]  Alex and Shane were in elevated trucks firing and I was on the ground because I brought a shooting mat so I was on the ground and I must have inhaled so much grass.
[00:18:12.488 --> 00:18:14.770]  Just ranch grass and dust.
[00:18:14.770 --> 00:18:16.671]  This is why you might even hear it in my voice today.
[00:18:16.671 --> 00:18:17.531]  It's a little rough.
[00:18:18.712 --> 00:18:25.033]  And then Jacobson was spotting and we just, we blasted the crap out of this I-beam.
[00:18:25.033 --> 00:18:33.335]  And I guess, I guess it looked like a military helicopter took some interest in this and was sort of flying, flying, checking us out.
[00:18:33.335 --> 00:18:34.036]  What's going on?
[00:18:34.036 --> 00:18:36.836]  And they may have seen some of the tracer rounds too.
[00:18:36.836 --> 00:18:38.117]  It was quite a show.
[00:18:38.117 --> 00:18:39.437]  And anyway, we got it all on video.
[00:18:40.317 --> 00:18:45.121]  And Jacobson is going to be editing that over the next few weeks, so you'll get to see that.
[00:18:45.121 --> 00:18:52.706]  That is 350 cals and a couple of 338 Lapuas blasting away here in Central Texas.
[00:18:52.706 --> 00:19:03.254]  And you know, I gotta say, the more the system talks about gun control, the bigger guns we want, the more guns we buy, the more ammo we buy, and the more we shoot.
[00:19:05.157 --> 00:19:13.062]  If people like Obama and Feinstein and Biden really wanted us to stop buying guns, they should stop talking about gun control.
[00:19:13.062 --> 00:19:14.442]  It's real simple.
[00:19:14.442 --> 00:19:22.387]  Every time you talk about gun control, I get a little itchy trigger finger and I want to go out and shoot somebody's .50 Cal Barrett.
[00:19:23.425 --> 00:19:25.126]  And it's the same with everybody.
[00:19:25.126 --> 00:19:31.851]  All the Patriots, everybody who loves firearms and loves sport shooting, they feel the same way.
[00:19:31.851 --> 00:19:40.557]  They want to go out, get on the trigger, get some trigger time, throw some lead downrange and blast away some I-beam like we did here.
[00:19:40.557 --> 00:19:41.797]  It was pretty wild.
[00:19:41.797 --> 00:19:50.043]  So, hey, as long as they keep talking about gun control, we're going to keep upsizing our weapons and our ammo and putting it on film for you.
[00:19:50.043 --> 00:19:51.044]  So stay with us.
[00:19:51.044 --> 00:19:52.965]  We'll be right back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:20:00.652 --> 00:20:02.054]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones.
[00:20:02.054 --> 00:20:12.724]  Myself, my family, the InfoWars.com team want to relay to you and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalists on every front.
[00:20:12.724 --> 00:20:16.828]  InfoWars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats.
[00:20:17.168 --> 00:20:19.909]  But we can't do that without your help.
[00:20:19.909 --> 00:20:31.194]  By getting the films, bumper stickers, and t-shirts at InfoWars.com, you will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[00:20:31.194 --> 00:20:34.356]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[00:20:34.676 --> 00:20:40.821]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[00:20:40.821 --> 00:20:50.729]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization and ultimate extermination.
[00:20:50.729 --> 00:20:52.210]  The war is here.
[00:20:52.210 --> 00:20:54.111]  It's an info war.
[00:20:54.111 --> 00:20:56.073]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[00:21:00.476 --> 00:21:01.596]  My name is Stephen Heuer.
[00:21:01.596 --> 00:21:08.898]  After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've observed that most brain malfunctions have at their roots some form of toxicity and brain damage.
[00:21:08.898 --> 00:21:20.940]  So whether it is poor memory, poor focus, lack of creative thinking, or more serious matters like inability to focus, speak normally, or remember things, the emphasis to getting one's brain working optimally needs to be on detoxification.
[00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:25.741]  One World Way supports your body's number one means of detoxification, which is glutathione production.
[00:21:26.101 --> 00:21:30.866]  My name is Angie, and my son has suffered from borderline autism and constipation.
[00:21:30.866 --> 00:21:35.110]  I got him on One World Way, and in two months his constipation is gone.
[00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:40.756]  He's become friendlier, he can carry on a normal conversation with me, and he's made his first friend.
[00:21:40.756 --> 00:21:44.499]  He's doing great, and he looks forward to taking One World Way every day.
[00:21:44.499 --> 00:21:48.984]  You could offer him a present, or a cake, and he would prefer the One World Way.
[00:21:49.304 --> 00:22:00.273]  Go to oneworldway.com, that's oneworld, W-H-E-Y.com, or call 888-988-3325, that's 888-988-3325.
[00:22:00.273 --> 00:22:04.317]  Now there's an amazing new natural antibiotic every person must have!

[00:22:29.758 --> 00:22:39.084]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[00:22:39.084 --> 00:22:39.885]  This capitalism?
[00:22:39.885 --> 00:22:46.169]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[00:22:46.169 --> 00:22:46.970]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[00:22:46.970 --> 00:22:50.112]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[00:24:21.373 --> 00:24:26.135]  Alright, we're back.
[00:24:26.135 --> 00:24:26.995]  Thanks for joining us.
[00:24:26.995 --> 00:24:29.736]  This is Mike Adams filling in today for Alex Jones.
[00:24:29.736 --> 00:24:30.816]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:24:30.816 --> 00:24:33.057]  Yes, you're in the right place.
[00:24:33.057 --> 00:24:43.760]  And, yes, as I was explaining before the break, my head is still ringing from going shooting with Alex yesterday with a .350 cal BMG rifle, all Barrett's.
[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:49.782]  Two of them were the M107A1 rifles, the brand new.
[00:24:49.782 --> 00:24:55.104]  I think there must be more .50 cals in Texas than anywhere in the country.
[00:24:55.104 --> 00:24:57.185]  And Texans sure know how to use them.
[00:24:57.185 --> 00:25:05.549]  But anyway, speaking of knowing how to use firearms, oh and by the way, we have a really exciting guest coming up in the next few minutes.
[00:25:05.549 --> 00:25:08.050]  Joe Dixon from Morningland Dairy about the
[00:25:09.190 --> 00:25:14.642]  continued scourge of oppression of food freedom in america so that's coming up shortly
[00:25:16.564 --> 00:25:28.086]  Remember when Joe Biden was asked by that reporter, that journalist, about should women use guns to defend themselves?
[00:25:28.086 --> 00:25:30.546]  And Joe Biden said, get a shotgun!
[00:25:30.546 --> 00:25:31.767]  Get a shotgun!
[00:25:31.767 --> 00:25:34.967]  You don't need an AR-15, get a shotgun!
[00:25:34.967 --> 00:25:40.788]  Well, it turns out that shotguns kick a whole lot worse than an AR-15.
[00:25:40.788 --> 00:25:44.989]  And there's a lot of, let's say, smaller frame women who have trouble.
[00:25:45.609 --> 00:25:50.051]  With shooting 12-gauge slugs or steel shot or what have you.
[00:25:50.051 --> 00:26:03.258]  And just to prove this point, not to make fun of women, but just to prove this point that Joe Biden has no idea what he's talking about, someone out there put together a really interesting video, a YouTube video, that we're going to play right now.
[00:26:03.258 --> 00:26:06.040]  So I'm going to narrate it for radio listeners, but take a look.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:06.620]  Go ahead and roll that.
[00:26:07.182 --> 00:26:13.730]  She's asking if a ban goes into effect on certain kinds of weapons and high-capacity magazines.
[00:26:13.730 --> 00:26:14.831]  And what's your name?
[00:26:14.831 --> 00:26:15.492]  Kate.
[00:26:15.492 --> 00:26:19.677]  Kate, if you want to protect yourself, get a double-barrel shotgun.
[00:26:21.032 --> 00:26:30.398]  I have the shells of a 12-gauge shotgun, and I promise you, as I told my wife, we live in an area that's wooded and somewhat secluded.
[00:26:30.398 --> 00:26:40.384]  I said, Jill, if there's ever a problem, just walk out on the balcony here, or walk out, put that double-barrel shotgun, and fire two blasts.
[00:26:40.384 --> 00:26:49.910]  So here's women shooting the shotgun, and blowing themselves over, and smacking themselves in the faces with the shotguns.
[00:26:51.397 --> 00:26:53.419]  Ouch.
[00:26:53.419 --> 00:26:55.000]  That looked like it hurt.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:56.481]  Oh.
[00:26:56.481 --> 00:26:57.381]  Oh, man.
[00:26:57.381 --> 00:26:58.322]  That's gonna bruise.
[00:26:58.322 --> 00:27:00.944]  Gonna feel that one.
[00:27:00.944 --> 00:27:05.087]  You'll be completely fine.
[00:27:05.087 --> 00:27:05.767]  There's another.
[00:27:05.767 --> 00:27:10.551]  Oh, it's like a 75-pound girl shooting a shotgun.
[00:27:10.551 --> 00:27:15.474]  Looked like a Sega 12.
[00:27:15.474 --> 00:27:16.715]  They're not having much success.
[00:27:16.715 --> 00:27:18.196]  Oh.
[00:27:18.196 --> 00:27:20.118]  Oh, a multi-fire fail right there.
[00:27:23.937 --> 00:27:31.723]  So, these women are having a lot of trouble with these 12-gauge shotguns.
[00:27:31.723 --> 00:27:36.426]  I promise you, whoever's coming in is not going to... You don't need an AR-15.
[00:27:36.426 --> 00:27:37.947]  It's harder to aim.
[00:27:37.947 --> 00:27:39.128]  It's harder to use.
[00:27:39.128 --> 00:27:44.932]  So now, here's a woman firing an AR-15 with good accuracy.
[00:27:44.932 --> 00:27:46.873]  Boom, boom, boom.
[00:27:46.873 --> 00:27:48.434]  Multi-shots.
[00:27:48.434 --> 00:27:48.935]  Full control.
[00:27:50.524 --> 00:27:54.666]  And in fact, you don't need 30 rounds to protect yourself.
[00:27:54.666 --> 00:27:56.827]  Buy a shotgun.
[00:27:56.827 --> 00:28:00.909]  Buy a shotgun.
[00:28:00.909 --> 00:28:04.450]  And there's a guy with a blasted shotgun and his pants fall down.
[00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:08.272]  Oh, that's more than we wanted to see right there.
[00:28:08.272 --> 00:28:12.474]  The crew was joking that he needs a flash suppressor.
[00:28:12.474 --> 00:28:13.535]  His pants fell down.
[00:28:14.475 --> 00:28:20.299]  Anyway, the point is, the point is, Joe Biden, you need to learn the laws of physics.
[00:28:20.299 --> 00:28:23.781]  In fact, Newtonian laws of motion.
[00:28:23.781 --> 00:28:27.324]  For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[00:28:27.324 --> 00:28:34.889]  If you're going to push a lot of lead out the front of a shotgun, it's going to kick, and it turns out that a shotgun kicks way more than an AR-15.
[00:28:34.889 --> 00:28:43.755]  Even a 95-pound light-framed woman can handle an AR-15 much easier than shooting a 12-gauge shotgun with most loads.
[00:28:44.415 --> 00:28:47.498]  So, hey, I'm sorry to break it to you, but that's reality, you know?
[00:28:47.498 --> 00:28:49.621]  That's physics.
[00:28:49.621 --> 00:28:55.406]  I love how these people in Washington like to just make up their own laws of physics or laws of economics.
[00:28:55.406 --> 00:28:59.391]  You know, like, if we raise taxes, we're going to get more tax revenue.
[00:28:59.391 --> 00:29:01.893]  No, you're not, because everybody's going to go out of business.
[00:29:01.893 --> 00:29:03.134]  Businesses are going to stop hiring.
[00:29:03.795 --> 00:29:04.595]  Or how about this one?
[00:29:04.595 --> 00:29:09.478]  If we take more money from people's paychecks, that's good for the economy.
[00:29:09.478 --> 00:29:10.378]  No it isn't!
[00:29:10.378 --> 00:29:11.239]  Guess what?
[00:29:11.239 --> 00:29:18.402]  On the top of DrudgeReport.com right now, the income, the take-home income in America has dropped the most since 1959.
[00:29:20.163 --> 00:29:26.990]  That means the discretionary income that people have to buy things at places like Walmart continues to plummet.
[00:29:26.990 --> 00:29:30.894]  Which is why Walmart is having a disastrous month here.
[00:29:30.894 --> 00:29:33.477]  Well, February was a disastrous month and March will probably be again in 2013.
[00:29:35.359 --> 00:29:41.284]  And it's going to get even worse for Walmart and the economy as the government takes more taxes.
[00:29:41.284 --> 00:29:42.685]  Anyway, stay with us straight ahead.
[00:29:42.685 --> 00:29:47.890]  We've got an interview with Morningland Dairy founder Joe Dixon coming right up.
[00:29:47.890 --> 00:29:49.791]  We'll be right back with that.
[00:29:49.791 --> 00:29:51.192]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.192 --> 00:29:53.714]  The empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.714 --> 00:29:56.397]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.919 --> 00:30:02.480]  Your freedoms are on the line.
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.281]  The Second Amendment is in danger.
[00:30:04.281 --> 00:30:06.622]  How soon before your freedoms are taken away?
[00:30:06.622 --> 00:30:08.344]  What can you not live without?
[00:30:08.344 --> 00:30:10.045]  What is your greatest dependency?
[00:30:10.045 --> 00:30:11.045]  Is it your guns?
[00:30:11.045 --> 00:30:11.986]  Is it your home?
[00:30:11.986 --> 00:30:13.427]  No, it's food.
[00:30:13.427 --> 00:30:15.528]  It all boils down to the food supply.
[00:30:15.528 --> 00:30:19.030]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:20.271]  Don't be dependent.
[00:30:20.271 --> 00:30:21.351]  Be self-sufficient.
[00:30:21.351 --> 00:30:23.012]  Don't wait for the government to feed you.
[00:30:23.012 --> 00:30:23.673]  Feed yourself.
[00:30:24.113 --> 00:30:26.353]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[00:30:26.353 --> 00:30:29.894]  Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from eFoodsDirect.
[00:30:29.894 --> 00:30:32.655]  It's the best long-term storable food on the planet.

[00:31:00.797 --> 00:31:01.877]  I had tried everything.
[00:31:01.877 --> 00:31:04.218]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[00:31:04.218 --> 00:31:07.359]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[00:31:07.359 --> 00:31:12.180]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:19.042]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[00:31:19.042 --> 00:31:29.505]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:31:30.265 --> 00:31:34.727]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst, and Rebound.
[00:31:34.727 --> 00:31:40.989]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[00:31:40.989 --> 00:31:42.570]  Now that's results.
[00:31:42.570 --> 00:31:49.353]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfoWarsTeam.com and to order just three of their products.
[00:31:49.353 --> 00:31:55.075]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.
[00:31:55.075 --> 00:31:57.616]  Start your journey to health and wellness today.
[00:31:57.616 --> 00:31:58.897]  InfoWarsTeam.com
[00:32:00.177 --> 00:32:02.078]  Introducing Pro-1.
[00:32:02.078 --> 00:32:05.720]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:10.262]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[00:32:10.262 --> 00:32:16.365]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[00:32:16.365 --> 00:32:27.150]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals all in one filter element.
[00:32:27.350 --> 00:32:30.211]  It is the only one that does it and out of the gates!
[00:32:30.211 --> 00:32:33.852]  We have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[00:32:33.852 --> 00:32:48.575]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[00:32:48.795 --> 00:32:51.716]  I'd like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here.
[00:32:51.716 --> 00:32:54.037]  It came to me when I tried to classify your species.
[00:32:54.037 --> 00:32:55.657]  I realized that you're not actually mammals.
[00:33:19.437 --> 00:33:29.724]  Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding environment, but you humans do not.
[00:33:29.724 --> 00:33:38.489]  You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed.
[00:33:38.489 --> 00:33:39.650]  The only way you can
[00:33:49.090 --> 00:33:53.852]  There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern.
[00:33:53.852 --> 00:33:57.093]  Do you know what it is?
[00:33:57.093 --> 00:34:00.054]  A virus.
[00:34:00.054 --> 00:34:02.375]  Human beings are a disease.
[00:34:02.375 --> 00:34:05.336]  A cancer of this planet.
[00:34:05.336 --> 00:34:08.057]  You are a plague.
[00:34:08.057 --> 00:34:10.538]  We are the cure.
[00:34:15.669 --> 00:34:19.774]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[00:34:19.774 --> 00:34:21.495]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:34:25.795 --> 00:34:26.976]  Alright, welcome back, friends.
[00:34:26.976 --> 00:34:29.879]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger, filling in for Alex today.
[00:34:29.879 --> 00:34:31.421]  Yeah, my voice is a little rough.
[00:34:31.421 --> 00:34:37.887]  I was sucking in all this dust and grass when we went shooting yesterday, and it has literally affected me.
[00:34:37.887 --> 00:34:46.676]  You know, the other thing is, we had a truck out there that had a big steel dump bed that we use as a shooting platform.
[00:34:47.677 --> 00:34:53.580]  And every time you shoot out of that bed, it's like being in a giant bell and it just would ring that bell.
[00:34:53.580 --> 00:35:01.383]  The whole bed would reverberate and it would vibrate through your whole body and I swear when I woke up this morning my head was still ringing from that.
[00:35:01.383 --> 00:35:03.064]  It is a massive concussion.
[00:35:03.064 --> 00:35:03.524]  Enough on that.
[00:35:08.053 --> 00:35:10.254]  Okay, so we've got Joe Dixon joining us here in just a minute.
[00:35:10.254 --> 00:35:13.275]  I want to get a couple notes in there before then.
[00:35:13.275 --> 00:35:18.556]  Tonight on the Nightly News, we're going to be covering the fact that according to the U.S.
[00:35:18.556 --> 00:35:25.538]  Supreme Court, criminals do not have to comply with any gun registration legislation.
[00:35:25.538 --> 00:35:35.902]  So it's not just that they won't comply, we already know that, it's that legally they are in effect restricted from complying due to the Fifth Amendment.
[00:35:37.924 --> 00:35:41.567]  The fact that you are protected from self-incrimination under the U.S.
[00:35:41.567 --> 00:35:42.127]  Constitution.
[00:35:42.127 --> 00:35:42.887]  So the U.S.
[00:35:42.887 --> 00:35:47.871]  Supreme Court has ruled in the past, and we're going to discuss this tonight with Jim Mars.
[00:35:47.871 --> 00:35:50.032]  It's just one of the many topics we'll be discussing.
[00:35:50.032 --> 00:35:54.896]  Our focus is raw milk and food freedom, but we're going to cover this as well.
[00:35:56.013 --> 00:36:00.919]  That criminals do not have to comply, in fact, are restricted from complying.
[00:36:00.919 --> 00:36:13.395]  So if they pass a gun registration law or a gun confiscation law, by law, only law-abiding citizens must comply with those restrictions, which of course is the complete opposite of what you want.
[00:36:14.176 --> 00:36:17.860]  You don't need to register honest, ethical citizens who have firearms.
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:24.726]  What you want to do, in essence, is find the criminals who might be robbing a bank or committing some crime with it.
[00:36:24.726 --> 00:36:27.208]  But those are exactly the people that are exempt, according to the U.S.
[00:36:27.208 --> 00:36:28.249]  Supreme Court.
[00:36:28.249 --> 00:36:32.533]  So we'll be covering that tonight in Infowars Nightly News, and some other news as well.
[00:36:32.533 --> 00:36:38.819]  We're going to have a commercial, a parody commercial for Obama Bites, the multivitamin made in China.
[00:36:39.560 --> 00:36:46.947]  That contains miraculous, amazing minerals like Obomnesium, which causes you to forget American history.
[00:36:46.947 --> 00:36:50.330]  All the way back to 1776, it's a very powerful nutrient.
[00:36:50.330 --> 00:36:56.455]  And it's also got Fukushima for extracellular energy, and Squeezium to help the TSA do their jobs better.
[00:36:56.455 --> 00:37:02.501]  Because, you know, you can never have enough Squeezium when you're going through security at the airport, right?
[00:37:02.501 --> 00:37:03.742]  Yeah.
[00:37:03.742 --> 00:37:04.222]  Nice.
[00:37:04.222 --> 00:37:04.422]  Okay.
[00:37:05.416 --> 00:37:11.182]  Let's turn to Food Freedom and Joe Dixon with Morningland Dairy out of Missouri.
[00:37:11.182 --> 00:37:12.744]  And he joins us now by phone.
[00:37:12.744 --> 00:37:15.567]  And let me set this up here.
[00:37:15.567 --> 00:37:18.710]  Joe is going to give us the breakdown of what happened there in Morningland Dairy.
[00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:19.871]  And I got to apologize to Joe.
[00:37:19.871 --> 00:37:24.676]  I tried to connect with him before and we had some storms and I couldn't get that interview done.
[00:37:24.676 --> 00:37:27.339]  So I want to invite him here today to tell his story.
[00:37:28.180 --> 00:37:33.463]  To you, the InfoWars listeners, so that you know this is still going on in America.
[00:37:33.463 --> 00:37:38.986]  The government is still oppressing food freedoms and food rights and going after farmers.
[00:37:38.986 --> 00:37:41.148]  And here to tell us that story is Joe Dixon.
[00:37:41.148 --> 00:37:44.390]  Joe, thank you for joining us live today on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:37:44.390 --> 00:37:47.211]  I very much appreciate you having me on, Mike.
[00:37:47.211 --> 00:37:49.833]  First off, I'd like to say I do appreciate your humor.
[00:37:50.495 --> 00:37:54.977]  Yes, we can face reality when the people who are trying to oppress us have a very hard time facing reality.
[00:38:12.242 --> 00:38:18.884]  So, I just say, you know, let's feed them some extra squeeze-ium and let them feel each other up there at the airport.
[00:38:18.884 --> 00:38:21.004]  What do they do when there's no passengers in line?
[00:38:21.004 --> 00:38:22.605]  Do they check each other?
[00:38:22.605 --> 00:38:24.165]  Huh?
[00:38:24.165 --> 00:38:25.285]  That's a good question.
[00:38:25.285 --> 00:38:28.886]  Yeah, I bet that's what those curtains are for.
[00:38:28.886 --> 00:38:29.566]  Yeah.
[00:38:29.566 --> 00:38:31.607]  Yeah, they're calibrating the machines.
[00:38:31.607 --> 00:38:34.628]  They're calibrating the x-ray machines is what they're going to say.
[00:38:34.628 --> 00:38:36.848]  Yeah, actually, right, that's it.
[00:38:36.848 --> 00:38:38.208]  Anyway, sorry Joe, I don't mean to get off track.
[00:38:38.208 --> 00:38:40.109]  Go ahead, tell us about yourself.
[00:38:41.112 --> 00:38:43.253]  Well, my name is Joseph Dixon of Morningland Deer.
[00:38:43.253 --> 00:38:45.454]  I go by Joe most of the time.
[00:38:45.454 --> 00:39:06.361]  And my wife and I have been fighting a battle with the state of Missouri, the FDA, the Attorney General's Office, now apparently appearing to be an apparent part of the state of California, over our abilities to have raw milk cheese, to have a product that we consider to be very healthy,
[00:39:07.495 --> 00:39:07.915]  I don't know.
[00:39:31.716 --> 00:39:34.457]  In my opinion, the government doesn't want anything that's healthy for us.
[00:39:34.457 --> 00:39:38.879]  I think that's why I appreciated your humor when you first came on.
[00:39:38.879 --> 00:39:41.300]  Because of what you were saying there.
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:44.722]  But anyway, we were, had an embargo letter put on our door.
[00:39:44.722 --> 00:39:48.723]  First off, our case started with Rawsome Foods in California.
[00:39:48.723 --> 00:39:53.005]  Some of our cheese was confiscated in the rating in Rawsome Foods of California.
[00:39:53.005 --> 00:39:54.946]  I think you've had their case on there before.
[00:39:55.185 --> 00:40:05.827]  Yeah, but just to give people a brief, that was armed agents, both state, county, and federally funded, armed raid on James Stewart and Rawsome Foods in California.
[00:40:05.827 --> 00:40:18.490]  They confiscated over $50,000 worth of food and destroyed it, and took all of James Stewart's money and threw him in jail, and two different counties then prosecuted him for multiple felony crimes.
[00:40:18.490 --> 00:40:19.130]  So that's that.
[00:40:19.130 --> 00:40:20.930]  I'm just giving the background for people who may not know.
[00:40:20.930 --> 00:40:23.851]  That's very much appreciated, but they need to know where it all started from.
[00:40:23.851 --> 00:40:24.351]  Okay, go ahead.
[00:40:24.974 --> 00:40:39.464]  Then, 55 days later, the state of Missouri and the FDA, in some form or another, got information from the state of California that we may have had a possible contamination of listeria, staphylococcus, in our cheese.
[00:40:39.464 --> 00:40:42.465]  Notice it said 55 days later.
[00:40:42.465 --> 00:40:45.047]  We wonder where that cheese was for 55 days.
[00:40:45.047 --> 00:40:47.609]  Who's hands and how it was handled for 55 days?
[00:40:47.609 --> 00:40:53.613]  Well, yeah, they probably stored it in a hot warehouse somewhere just to make sure it had listeria.
[00:40:54.588 --> 00:40:55.889]  Well, we don't know.
[00:40:55.889 --> 00:41:08.194]  Also, what's very interesting, as we go through the invoices of where we sold cheese to James Stewart for Rawsome Food, the FDA listed that they picked up one pound packages of cheese.
[00:41:08.194 --> 00:41:11.315]  The only cheese we ever sold to Rawsome was half pounds or less.
[00:41:11.315 --> 00:41:12.816]  Interesting.
[00:41:12.816 --> 00:41:19.279]  So, was there actually a raid conducted on your farm, or how did they oppress you exactly?
[00:41:19.279 --> 00:41:23.841]  No, since we were licensed and inspected and everything as, quote, they want you to be.
[00:41:24.597 --> 00:41:30.081]  They came in, they came in forceful but polite, if you want to use that term.
[00:41:30.081 --> 00:41:32.002]  Yeah, yeah, polite with the guns.
[00:41:32.002 --> 00:41:32.463]  Yeah.
[00:41:32.463 --> 00:41:33.744]  Well, there were no guns.
[00:41:33.744 --> 00:41:34.744]  Oh, okay.
[00:41:34.744 --> 00:41:38.187]  They did, they came in forceful but polite.
[00:41:38.187 --> 00:41:41.789]  They came in letting us know exactly what they were going to do, okay?
[00:41:41.789 --> 00:41:42.570]  Uh-huh.
[00:41:42.570 --> 00:41:51.336]  Now, they put an embargo letter on our door, our chief house door, where our cheese is stored, and to the day of which they destroyed it, we were not allowed to take anything out of that cooler.
[00:41:52.529 --> 00:41:56.892]  The day in which they destroyed it, which was almost two and a half years later.
[00:41:56.892 --> 00:42:02.094]  Now, had you ever had anybody get violently sick from eating any of your products, ever?
[00:42:02.094 --> 00:42:02.655]  No.
[00:42:02.655 --> 00:42:08.698]  No, not one complaint in 30 years of being in business as Morningland Dairy, no.
[00:42:08.698 --> 00:42:14.462]  And did the FDA care about that history, or did they take that into account?
[00:42:14.462 --> 00:42:20.605]  No, because we have a timeline on our site that the state billboard sent to some of the representatives in Jefferson.
[00:42:20.605 --> 00:42:22.126]  Give us your website so we can bring that up.
[00:42:22.915 --> 00:42:25.097]  Morninglanddairy.com.
[00:42:25.097 --> 00:42:26.758]  Morninglanddairy.com.
[00:42:26.758 --> 00:42:27.299]  Yeah.
[00:42:27.299 --> 00:42:27.539]  Okay.
[00:42:27.539 --> 00:42:30.882]  My wife's been very busy, uh, cause this has hit her very hard.
[00:42:30.882 --> 00:42:41.832]  Uh, so it's not up to speed as good as it could be, but we appreciate that people would look and see because we're still, we're still fighting because now it's to the point we can ask the question.
[00:42:41.832 --> 00:42:48.898]  When you go to court, when you guys start asking the question of the milk board in the state, we were told that these people have the right of kings.
[00:42:50.327 --> 00:43:00.334]  When you say that they functioned as if they had the right of kings, are you saying that they just felt like they ruled over you, they owned you and they could control everything that you did on your farm?
[00:43:21.312 --> 00:43:26.215]  No, but they have regulations they are supposed to go by, okay?
[00:43:26.215 --> 00:43:31.157]  And what we ran into was, it finally got to the point, how much time do we have left, Mike?
[00:43:31.157 --> 00:43:33.038]  No, we have plenty of time, keep going.
[00:43:33.038 --> 00:43:34.999]  Okay.
[00:43:34.999 --> 00:43:47.005]  It came about, finally it got to the point, we finally asked Don Falls of the State Milk Board, Don, if we tested this block of cheese up to 100 times, our plant manager, Joe Dyadid,
[00:43:47.915 --> 00:43:50.277]  We test this block of cheese up to 100 times now.
[00:43:50.277 --> 00:43:54.380]  This block of cheese is 40 plus or minus pounds, okay?
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:56.963]  Up to 100 times and it came back clean every time.
[00:43:56.963 --> 00:43:58.744]  Would we be permitted to sell this block of cheese?
[00:43:58.744 --> 00:44:00.065]  We would, wouldn't we?
[00:44:00.065 --> 00:44:01.787]  He said, absolutely not.
[00:44:01.787 --> 00:44:03.468]  It would all be suspect.
[00:44:03.468 --> 00:44:06.470]  So at that point, I looked at him, I said, okay.
[00:44:06.470 --> 00:44:11.975]  In other words, you're telling me then, you don't trust your own regulations.
[00:44:11.975 --> 00:44:14.237]  You don't trust your own methods of testing.
[00:44:15.265 --> 00:44:23.509]  Because if you think about it, a 40-pound block, if you test it up to 100 times, first off, there'd be very little of the cheese left, potentially.
[00:44:23.509 --> 00:44:27.111]  And how can you justify that?
[00:44:27.111 --> 00:44:31.573]  But Joe, you gotta realize, and I know you know this, that it's not about the science.
[00:44:31.573 --> 00:44:33.114]  It's not about food science.
[00:44:33.114 --> 00:44:34.895]  It's not about the testing results.
[00:44:34.895 --> 00:44:40.838]  This is a political war to go after raw milk, dairy, raw cheese producers.
[00:44:40.838 --> 00:44:43.019]  The numbers don't matter.
[00:44:44.246 --> 00:44:44.806]  Yes.
[00:44:44.806 --> 00:44:48.389]  If the audience will... I don't know, Mike, if you can get a hold of it or not.
[00:44:48.389 --> 00:45:00.557]  Russell Foods, the people that bought from them, actually signed a paper saying they wanted trace elements of... or trace bacteria in there so that they could build their immune system.
[00:45:00.557 --> 00:45:03.419]  That's how our immune systems are built on this Earth.
[00:45:03.419 --> 00:45:03.799]  I agree.
[00:45:03.799 --> 00:45:05.540]  We don't want sterilized food, really.
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:09.123]  We actually want a little bit of probiotic in there, yeah.
[00:45:09.123 --> 00:45:09.303]  Yes.
[00:45:11.921 --> 00:45:16.985]  Good farming practices we have today, and I put that in quotation marks.
[00:45:16.985 --> 00:45:19.387]  Our land has become what, Mike?
[00:45:19.387 --> 00:45:20.488]  It's become sterile.
[00:45:20.488 --> 00:45:21.469]  Yes.
[00:45:21.469 --> 00:45:25.212]  Well, and the FDA says the only safe food is sterilized food.
[00:45:25.212 --> 00:45:35.641]  The almond producers in California a couple of years ago had to start fumigating or irradiating their almonds because raw almonds were outlawed by the state board in California.
[00:45:35.641 --> 00:45:38.223]  And that's where most of the almonds come from in the U.S.
[00:45:38.223 --> 00:45:39.344]  And the same is true with milk.
[00:45:41.610 --> 00:45:42.931]  We are not.
[00:45:42.931 --> 00:45:47.753]  Our bodies, as far as what we contain in our bodies, are not sterile.
[00:45:47.753 --> 00:45:50.394]  If our bodies were sterile, we would be dead.
[00:45:50.394 --> 00:45:54.757]  Well, in fact, there are more non-human cells in your body than there are human cells.
[00:45:54.757 --> 00:45:57.518]  That's how much bacteria is living in your body.
[00:45:57.518 --> 00:46:00.800]  And we need that bacteria to stay alive and to be healthy.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.060]  That's right.
[00:46:02.060 --> 00:46:06.002]  Now, if it gets out of balance, yes, then you have diseases, you have other problems.
[00:46:06.002 --> 00:46:07.203]  But with our food supply,
[00:46:07.927 --> 00:46:12.751]  Being changed so much, we're running into that very problem now.
[00:46:12.751 --> 00:46:18.576]  Our food supply doesn't supply the nutrients we need in order for our bodies to maintain the health.
[00:46:18.576 --> 00:46:22.999]  So if you don't mind me saying, we're coming upon the plagues of Egypt now, upon the United States of America.
[00:46:22.999 --> 00:46:29.825]  Yes, through disease epidemics, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's, osteoporosis, mental disorders, you name it.
[00:46:29.825 --> 00:46:30.325]  Yep.
[00:46:30.325 --> 00:46:31.126]  Correct.
[00:46:31.126 --> 00:46:34.148]  Now, anyway, so we have been fighting this battle.
[00:46:34.148 --> 00:46:37.531]  We're now asking your audience there to help
[00:46:38.214 --> 00:46:38.414]  Yes.
[00:46:38.414 --> 00:46:38.534]  Yes.
[00:47:01.112 --> 00:47:13.354]  But they said here in the cheese plant, and you can read the timeline on our site of the state milk board, where as of September the 9th, now remember this started on August the 26th of 2010.
[00:47:13.354 --> 00:47:29.497]  By September the 9th of 2010, they had already decided without one sickness, one illness, nothing, and without any proper testing of our cheese, any state or federal proper testing of our cheese at all, they had already decided that our cheese was not fit for animal consumption.
[00:47:30.728 --> 00:47:32.449]  So you couldn't even sell it as animal feed.
[00:47:32.449 --> 00:47:44.292]  But look, don't you find it shocking that the federal government will openly allow aspartame in the food supply, MSG in the food supply, sodium nitrite in the processed meat, which we know causes cancer.
[00:47:44.292 --> 00:47:47.853]  They will allow GMOs to be hidden in the food supply.
[00:47:47.853 --> 00:47:49.534]  The FDA is being petitioned right now to allow
[00:47:50.254 --> 00:47:54.876]  Aspartame to be part of the definition of milk so they don't even have to put it on the label.
[00:47:54.876 --> 00:48:03.778]  Cows are being injected with a drug from Merck to fatten them up in the last few days of their lives so they weigh more and the cattle factories get more.
[00:48:03.778 --> 00:48:05.819]  All of this is openly tolerated, Joe.
[00:48:05.819 --> 00:48:16.983]  The government says you can poison yourself to death with all these food additives and artificial colors and GMOs, but then they attack you for selling cheese that isn't sterilized.
[00:48:17.563 --> 00:48:18.083]  Yes.
[00:48:18.083 --> 00:48:19.203]  This is incredible!
[00:48:19.203 --> 00:48:20.144]  Yeah.
[00:48:20.144 --> 00:48:29.366]  We, the state bill, or well, or else the vet of the state of Missouri, whichever one it was, that our cheese, we couldn't even sell it for dog food.
[00:48:29.366 --> 00:48:36.727]  They said that because, they told us here on the site, they were concerned that we could contaminate the dog food plant it went to.
[00:48:36.727 --> 00:48:37.887]  Now think about this.
[00:48:37.887 --> 00:48:40.748]  We don't want to take this one illness without any proper testing.
[00:48:40.748 --> 00:48:44.789]  Now, let's go throughout the rest of the time, the rest of the time we were fighting in court,
[00:48:45.803 --> 00:48:49.867]  And under regulation, you have to prove you're innocent.
[00:48:49.867 --> 00:48:51.408]  They don't have to prove you're guilty.
[00:48:51.408 --> 00:48:51.969]  That's right.
[00:48:51.969 --> 00:48:53.670]  The due process is thrown out the window.
[00:48:53.670 --> 00:48:55.211]  This is true.
[00:48:55.211 --> 00:49:00.156]  Also, you are not permitted what we were told, trial by jury, which we said we won't have trial by jury.
[00:49:00.156 --> 00:49:02.698]  We knew a jury of our peers would at least look at the evidence.
[00:49:03.305 --> 00:49:04.146]  No, this is the other thing.
[00:49:04.146 --> 00:49:17.036]  Under, not just FDA, but also FTC, they have their own kangaroo court system where you have no rights, you have no trial by jury, you don't even have the normal rules of presenting your own evidence in the way that you would in a regular judicial system trial.
[00:49:17.036 --> 00:49:19.819]  So, you saw it first hand then, right?
[00:49:19.819 --> 00:49:21.580]  Yes, we saw it first hand.
[00:49:21.580 --> 00:49:22.521]  Incredible.
[00:49:22.521 --> 00:49:26.244]  The FDA came in and did 99 swabs over cheese plant and dairy.
[00:49:26.244 --> 00:49:28.426]  They all came back negative.
[00:49:28.426 --> 00:49:29.607]  That evidence was
[00:49:30.501 --> 00:49:31.401]  They came back clean.
[00:49:31.401 --> 00:49:32.982]  In other words, nothing there.
[00:49:32.982 --> 00:49:37.604]  That evidence was not permitted in the state court because those were federal tests.
[00:49:37.604 --> 00:49:39.925]  Now, think about this.
[00:49:39.925 --> 00:49:43.967]  If those tests would have come back positive, do you think they would have been permitted in court?
[00:49:43.967 --> 00:49:45.508]  Of course they would have.
[00:49:45.508 --> 00:49:48.929]  You know, we brought up a point to the people of Missouri.
[00:49:48.929 --> 00:49:53.572]  We're trying to bring this point out to the people of Missouri and the United States.
[00:49:53.572 --> 00:49:58.634]  That we have the judges paid through
[00:49:59.528 --> 00:50:01.969]  Yeah, he's on the government payroll.
[00:50:01.969 --> 00:50:05.409]  So are the regulators.
[00:50:05.409 --> 00:50:07.930]  So are the scientists.
[00:50:07.930 --> 00:50:08.570]  All confiscated money.
[00:50:26.806 --> 00:50:32.096]  So we asked, I'm asking the question, how do you work to get a fair trial under that system?
[00:50:32.298 --> 00:50:33.539]  Well, that's the trick.
[00:50:33.539 --> 00:50:35.441]  That's the catch-22, Joe Dixon.
[00:50:35.441 --> 00:50:36.542]  You don't get a fair trial.
[00:50:36.542 --> 00:50:37.763]  Welcome to America.
[00:50:37.763 --> 00:50:49.693]  I think it's also fascinating that you could have legally done what you did in North Korea, or China, or Cuba, or South America, but not in the land of the free, the United States of America.
[00:50:49.693 --> 00:50:52.655]  Suddenly, you're a criminal for making real food.
[00:50:52.655 --> 00:50:53.576]  But stay with us, Joe.
[00:50:53.576 --> 00:50:59.381]  We'll be right back after this break with more here on the Alex Jones Show with Joe Dixon from Morningland Dairy.
[00:51:01.280 --> 00:51:02.841]  Your freedoms are on the line.
[00:51:02.841 --> 00:51:04.641]  The Second Amendment is in danger.
[00:51:04.641 --> 00:51:06.982]  How soon before your freedoms are taken away?
[00:51:06.982 --> 00:51:08.703]  What can you not live without?
[00:51:08.703 --> 00:51:10.424]  What is your greatest dependency?
[00:51:10.424 --> 00:51:11.404]  Is it your guns?
[00:51:11.404 --> 00:51:12.364]  Is it your home?
[00:51:12.364 --> 00:51:13.785]  No, it's food.
[00:51:13.785 --> 00:51:15.886]  It all boils down to the food supply.
[00:51:15.886 --> 00:51:19.387]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[00:51:19.387 --> 00:51:20.628]  Don't be dependent.
[00:51:20.628 --> 00:51:21.728]  Be self-sufficient.
[00:51:21.728 --> 00:51:23.369]  Don't wait for the government to feed you.
[00:51:23.369 --> 00:51:24.029]  Feed yourself.
[00:51:24.489 --> 00:51:26.710]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[00:51:26.710 --> 00:51:30.272]  Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from eFoodsDirect.

[00:51:52.441 --> 00:51:52.721]  Call 800-409-5633.
[00:51:54.022 --> 00:51:54.483]  I think so.
[00:52:00.643 --> 00:52:03.825]  Is this the year you finally get serious about your family's drinking water?
[00:52:03.825 --> 00:52:07.187]  If so, keep listening for a special offer from Big Berkey Water Filters.
[00:52:07.187 --> 00:52:10.189]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water is fluoridated?
[00:52:10.189 --> 00:52:21.115]  Berkey Water Filters distinguish themselves from many other filtration systems with the capability to significantly reduce dangerous chlorine, fluoride, arsenic, and disinfection byproducts from municipal water via the Black Berkey and PF line of filters.
[00:52:21.115 --> 00:52:22.256]  Then there's affordability.
[00:52:22.256 --> 00:52:27.159]  At only 1.7 cents per gallon, Berkey Water Filters purify treated and untreated water, even
[00:52:27.159 --> 00:52:27.599]  I think so.
[00:52:54.998 --> 00:53:02.523]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates.
[00:53:02.523 --> 00:53:05.825]  Do you know the number one most valuable item in a crisis?
[00:53:05.825 --> 00:53:11.988]  Some people think the answer is gold, others think it's a gun, but the correct answer will shock you.
[00:53:11.988 --> 00:53:19.793]  I just created a free video at Crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis.
[00:53:21.574 --> 00:53:24.197]  97% of Americans don't have this one critical item.
[00:53:24.197 --> 00:53:26.359]  In fact, they haven't even given it a thought.
[00:53:26.359 --> 00:53:33.847]  And the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door.
[00:53:33.847 --> 00:53:38.332]  But I have to tell you, it could literally make the difference between life and death for you and your family.
[00:53:38.812 --> 00:53:45.059]  Watch my video at Crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis.
[00:53:45.059 --> 00:53:46.400]  You'll be shocked.
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:51.606]  See the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last three months.
[00:53:51.606 --> 00:53:56.692]  Go watch my video now at Crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down.
[00:53:56.692 --> 00:53:58.454]  Again, that's Crisis123.com.
[00:54:09.710 --> 00:54:14.372]  What you're hearing is an interview with Joe Dixon from Morningland Dairy in Missouri.
[00:54:14.372 --> 00:54:18.493]  And this is Mike Adams filling in for Alex Jones today.
[00:54:18.493 --> 00:54:20.254]  And this is the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:20.254 --> 00:54:23.295]  This is just so you know you're in the right spot.
[00:54:23.295 --> 00:54:27.137]  And what we're hearing is a classic example of government coercion.
[00:54:27.757 --> 00:54:41.644]  And if you wonder why things are so bad in America today, I mean, America is still a wonderful country, and if we can restore it to what it used to be, it can be the world leader again in so many areas, including morals and ethics, by the way.
[00:54:41.644 --> 00:54:48.688]  But the reason it has devolved so much is because of exactly the kind of thing we're hearing about here, where they're destroying real food.
[00:54:48.688 --> 00:54:51.629]  They're destroying farmers, putting them out of business.
[00:54:51.629 --> 00:54:54.671]  And now, Joe Dixon, we've only got a couple minutes left with you here, but
[00:54:55.311 --> 00:55:02.135]  Iowa has now a proposed bill to legalize raw milk in the state of Iowa.
[00:55:02.135 --> 00:55:12.100]  Are you familiar with other legislative efforts to legalize this so that consumers can have their food freedom even in the face of federal tyranny?
[00:55:12.100 --> 00:55:16.642]  Yes, many states are headed that direction as far as trying to get it legalized.
[00:55:16.642 --> 00:55:22.585]  But unless the audience and families of the audience and people that the audience knows
[00:55:24.033 --> 00:55:29.394]  Get involved and call them their representative and say, look, we have these rights.
[00:55:29.394 --> 00:55:33.555]  We do not permit you to take these rights from us.
[00:55:33.555 --> 00:55:35.015]  And that's what's happened, Mike.
[00:55:35.015 --> 00:55:40.476]  We have permitted the system to take these rights from us without questioning.
[00:55:40.476 --> 00:55:41.376]  That's right.
[00:55:41.376 --> 00:55:42.096]  That's right.
[00:55:42.096 --> 00:55:43.537]  We've tolerated it.
[00:55:43.537 --> 00:55:44.537]  Yes, we have.
[00:55:44.537 --> 00:55:45.577]  We have tolerated it.
[00:55:45.577 --> 00:55:48.278]  And we now look where we are now because we have tolerated it.
[00:55:48.278 --> 00:55:49.358]  Now they've become the head.
[00:55:49.358 --> 00:55:50.178]  We've become the tail.
[00:55:51.266 --> 00:55:52.367]  And that's the way they want it to be.
[00:55:52.367 --> 00:56:01.336]  And the only way it gets turned around is by people standing up and becoming a self-regulating, self-controlling people again.
[00:56:01.336 --> 00:56:13.148]  I think our forefathers stated that, that we had to be a self-regulating people in order to keep the type of constitutional government we have that will actually function to the benefit of the people, not to the benefit of the government.
[00:56:13.439 --> 00:56:14.019]  That's right.
[00:56:14.019 --> 00:56:25.003]  It should be the people telling the government what the government is allowed to do and enforcing the limits of government, not the other way around where the government tells you what rights you will be granted by the kings in Washington.
[00:56:25.003 --> 00:56:27.743]  Yeah, and what happened to us?
[00:56:27.743 --> 00:56:35.746]  There's another case in Northwest Missouri where another dairy farm has a small cheese plant.
[00:56:35.746 --> 00:56:41.888]  They treated them a lot more fairly because we think because of the way we question them here.
[00:56:42.722 --> 00:56:49.686]  Because with everything that went on here, and as I said earlier about putting himself up for dog food, think about this.
[00:56:49.686 --> 00:56:55.009]  They came in two and a half years later under Judge's orders to destroy the cheese.
[00:56:55.009 --> 00:56:56.850]  36,400 pounds of cheese.
[00:56:56.850 --> 00:57:01.972]  Well, that's because you dared to question their sovereignty, as they say.
[00:57:01.972 --> 00:57:10.357]  But look, I want to give out your web address here, Joe, so that people go to morninglanddairy.com if you want to support Joe's efforts.
[00:57:10.777 --> 00:57:20.770]  Read up there, there's a donation link, there's an uncheese party that's mentioned there, and I really want you to support Joe and spread the word about Joe Dixon and his farm.
[00:57:20.770 --> 00:57:27.038]  And Joe, we're out of time for today, but I want to thank you for coming on, and I really appreciate what you're doing.
[00:57:27.648 --> 00:57:27.828]  Yeah.
[00:57:27.828 --> 00:57:28.229]  Sure, go ahead.
[00:57:42.566 --> 00:57:48.730]  They picked up 36,000 pounds of cheese by hand, which was 60 to 80 percent of it looked really good yet.
[00:57:48.730 --> 00:57:53.393]  But some of it, imagine your refrigerator is being closed for two and a half years and then going back to it.
[00:57:53.393 --> 00:57:53.573]  Yeah!
[00:57:53.573 --> 00:57:55.374]  You know, it wasn't refrigerated.
[00:57:55.374 --> 00:57:58.596]  But some of the cheese was, the whey was still coming out of it.
[00:57:58.596 --> 00:58:05.480]  So they got this whey that was supposed to be so contaminated, we couldn't even sell it for dog food, to be pasteurized.
[00:58:06.553 --> 00:58:12.254]  Then they get it on their clothes, they get it on themselves, they get back in their state vehicles and take it in their state vehicles.
[00:58:12.254 --> 00:58:12.754]  Right!
[00:58:12.754 --> 00:58:15.255]  They contaminate it and then they blame it on you.
[00:58:15.255 --> 00:58:24.557]  It's classic government tactic of quack science, bad politics, destruction of food, destruction of farmers.
[00:58:24.557 --> 00:58:28.058]  I'm sorry you've been victimized by them, Joe, but I thank you for joining us today.
[00:58:28.058 --> 00:58:30.099]  We will talk with you again in the future.
[00:58:30.099 --> 00:58:31.639]  Mike, the only way we've been victimized is the
[00:58:33.649 --> 00:58:34.489]  All right, Joe.
[00:58:34.489 --> 00:58:35.850]  Yeah, sorry, we're almost out of time.
[00:58:35.850 --> 00:58:36.590]  But stay with us, folks.
[00:58:36.590 --> 00:58:38.591]  We have a lot more straight ahead here on the Alex Jones Show.
[00:58:38.591 --> 00:58:43.133]  We'll be right back.
[00:58:43.133 --> 00:58:47.115]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.039 --> 00:58:58.062]  It's no secret that pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, moles and fungus can inflict severe damage in the human body.
[00:58:58.062 --> 00:59:02.684]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.

[00:59:55.840 --> 00:59:58.623]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.270 --> 01:00:10.115]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.115 --> 01:00:11.696]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.696 --> 01:00:13.237]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.237 --> 01:00:17.441]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.441 --> 01:00:21.505]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:25.546 --> 01:00:33.577]  All right, welcome to our number two here on the Alex Jones broadcast live from Austin, Texas.
[01:00:33.577 --> 01:00:41.467]  And we've got coming up in the third hour today, an interview between Alex Jones and Immortal Technique, the rap artist, musical artist.
[01:00:42.813 --> 01:00:45.313]  He's a poet of our modern age.
[01:00:45.313 --> 01:00:50.994]  In fact, we're going to be talking to Ashel Eldridge Seasons here in just the next few minutes.
[01:00:50.994 --> 01:01:03.337]  He's the creator of the Food Fight video that's going viral, teaching inner city audiences about the importance of saying no to processed foods and telling the truth about how those junk foods are actually killing us.
[01:01:03.337 --> 01:01:10.738]  It's funny, you know, that the government will go crazy, even the public will go crazy, over children dying at Sandy Hook.
[01:01:11.949 --> 01:01:24.812]  Which, you know, is understandable, but they will ignore how many children get brain cancer from eating, you know, processed, contaminated, genetically modified, chemically adulterated food.
[01:01:24.812 --> 01:01:36.996]  You know, there's gotta be orders of magnitude more children every year dying from that than dying from being shot by a madman in, you know, in a school setting.
[01:01:36.996 --> 01:01:38.656]  But, you know, you don't hear anything about that.
[01:01:40.819 --> 01:01:45.682]  And that they think the gun-free zone sign is going to solve the problem, as if it's a magical sign.
[01:01:45.682 --> 01:01:52.226]  But speaking of signs, you know, here's something really funny about Texas, that if you live here, you've seen these things.
[01:01:52.226 --> 01:01:59.911]  They have signs on the sides of the highways that say, obey all signs, state law.
[01:01:59.911 --> 01:02:03.313]  So they actually have a sign that says obey all the signs.
[01:02:03.313 --> 01:02:04.594]  Now, I'm thinking, what?
[01:02:05.393 --> 01:02:10.556]  What genius in the Texas Transportation Department came up with this?
[01:02:10.556 --> 01:02:14.958]  Because if you think about it, who is this sign really for?
[01:02:14.958 --> 01:02:22.542]  Because if you're the kind of person that already follows signs, then this sign is not going to make any more difference.
[01:02:22.542 --> 01:02:27.945]  You're already following the signs, so you don't need another sign to say, obey the other signs.
[01:02:27.945 --> 01:02:34.208]  But if you're the kind of person who doesn't follow signs, then you're not going to follow the sign that says to follow the signs.
[01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:41.447]  But somehow the Texas Highway Department thinks that this one sign is magical.
[01:02:41.447 --> 01:02:53.240]  That this sign, just like the gun-free zone sign, is a sign that has magical powers that you follow just this one sign which says obey all the other signs and then you magically obey all the other signs.
[01:02:53.866 --> 01:03:03.834]  So you see, we've got to end this, this, I don't know what this is, it's like a sign superstition, sign mythology, sign voodoo.
[01:03:03.834 --> 01:03:05.015]  That's what it is.
[01:03:05.015 --> 01:03:11.600]  There's voodoo going on in the Texas Transportation Department with these signs that say obey all the other signs.
[01:03:12.970 --> 01:03:20.331]  Now, in truth, what the sign really does is it probably causes more accidents because people are trying to read the dang sign when they should be driving.
[01:03:20.331 --> 01:03:26.412]  So instead of actually preventing accidents and improving safety, it's like you're driving along, holy cow, there's a sign.
[01:03:26.412 --> 01:03:27.053]  What does it say?
[01:03:27.053 --> 01:03:27.973]  Obey the other signs.
[01:03:27.973 --> 01:03:28.993]  What signs?
[01:03:28.993 --> 01:03:33.994]  And then you run right into a tractor trailer and then, you know, you got a big accident.
[01:03:33.994 --> 01:03:40.815]  You know, 30-something thousand people die every year in America on the roads, probably from reading those dang signs.
[01:03:42.082 --> 01:03:44.063]  That's probably what it is.
[01:03:44.063 --> 01:03:44.523]  Yep.
[01:03:44.523 --> 01:03:47.405]  And you notice, by the way, the government doesn't ban cars.
[01:03:47.405 --> 01:03:57.130]  No, no, they don't say, well, gosh, even if we can save one child in a car crash, we have to do everything possible, including banning all automobiles.
[01:03:57.130 --> 01:03:59.671]  That would be the logic that the gun control people have.
[01:03:59.671 --> 01:04:00.791]  That's their logic.
[01:04:00.791 --> 01:04:06.554]  If we can save one life, it's worth killing tens of thousands of people according to them.
[01:04:06.554 --> 01:04:09.176]  That's how crazy they are.
[01:04:09.176 --> 01:04:10.937]  No, you take a risk every time you get on the highway.
[01:04:10.937 --> 01:04:11.497]  You take a risk.
[01:04:12.901 --> 01:04:14.723]  That's what seatbelts are for, you know?
[01:04:14.723 --> 01:04:15.603]  Same thing about raw milk.
[01:04:15.603 --> 01:04:23.490]  You know, you can't live a life completely free of risk, and any government that tries to eliminate all risk in your life just becomes a tyranny.
[01:04:23.490 --> 01:04:27.453]  It just becomes a police state with oppression.
[01:04:27.453 --> 01:04:31.116]  You can't have government eliminate all risk in your life.
[01:04:31.116 --> 01:04:33.037]  Getting in a car is a risk.
[01:04:33.037 --> 01:04:34.538]  And by the way, real quick, a correction.
[01:04:34.538 --> 01:04:41.724]  Last time I was on, I was talking about aquaponics, and I used the term aquaculture accidentally.
[01:04:41.724 --> 01:04:41.964]  Yeah.
[01:04:43.274 --> 01:04:48.461]  Because sometimes, you know, the CPU skips a couple of cycles when you're in here in studio.
[01:04:48.461 --> 01:04:49.602]  But it's aquaponics!
[01:04:49.602 --> 01:04:54.589]  That's why, that's the name, that's the term to grow fish and plants together indoors, food production.
[01:04:54.589 --> 01:04:55.590]  It's amazing.
[01:04:55.590 --> 01:04:57.272]  Aquaponics!
[01:04:57.272 --> 01:04:58.534]  Not aquaculture.
[01:04:58.534 --> 01:04:59.275]  Totally different thing.
[01:04:59.275 --> 01:05:00.276]  Stay with us, we'll be right back.

[01:05:49.610 --> 01:05:52.752]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com or call

[01:06:01.707 --> 01:06:05.108]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[01:06:05.108 --> 01:06:11.151]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:06:11.151 --> 01:06:15.033]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[01:06:15.033 --> 01:06:16.633]  Check out SimpliSafe.
[01:06:16.633 --> 01:06:21.075]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.
[01:06:21.075 --> 01:06:23.796]  Go to GetSimpliSafe.com.
[01:06:23.796 --> 01:06:26.537]  SimpliSafe is independent and off the grid.
[01:06:26.537 --> 01:06:30.299]  It runs on battery power, so even if the grid goes down, you're protected.
[01:06:30.879 --> 01:06:37.544]  It's completely customizable, so you can use it in your home, business, boat, trailer, storage unit, or shed.
[01:06:37.544 --> 01:06:39.885]  GetSimplySafe.com.

[01:06:58.357 --> 01:07:00.519]  Again, that's GetSimplySafe.com.
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.221]  Your freedoms are on the line.
[01:07:03.221 --> 01:07:05.042]  The Second Amendment is in danger.
[01:07:05.042 --> 01:07:07.364]  How soon before your freedoms are taken away?
[01:07:07.364 --> 01:07:09.085]  What can you not live without?
[01:07:09.085 --> 01:07:10.806]  What is your greatest dependency?
[01:07:10.806 --> 01:07:11.787]  Is it your guns?
[01:07:11.787 --> 01:07:12.748]  Is it your home?
[01:07:12.748 --> 01:07:14.169]  No, it's food.
[01:07:14.169 --> 01:07:16.290]  It all boils down to the food supply.
[01:07:16.290 --> 01:07:19.793]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[01:07:19.793 --> 01:07:21.033]  Don't be dependent.
[01:07:21.033 --> 01:07:22.114]  Be self-sufficient.
[01:07:22.114 --> 01:07:23.775]  Don't wait for the government to feed you.
[01:07:23.775 --> 01:07:24.416]  Feed yourself.
[01:07:24.876 --> 01:07:27.098]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[01:07:27.098 --> 01:07:30.660]  Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from eFoodsDirect.
[01:07:30.660 --> 01:07:33.402]  It's the best long-term storable food on the planet.
[01:07:33.402 --> 01:07:35.764]  Get the popular Mega Patriot Pack free.
[01:07:35.764 --> 01:07:39.386]  A 24-day supply of food plus stove, cook pot, and fuel.
[01:07:39.386 --> 01:07:48.372]  Call 800-409-5633 or go to eFoodsDirect.com slash Alex and get up to 20 Mega Patriot Packs free with purchase.
[01:07:48.372 --> 01:07:52.595]  Build your food supply, be in control, be self-sufficient, and be a patriot.
[01:07:53.916 --> 01:07:54.396]  We're good to go.
[01:08:26.384 --> 01:08:28.565]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:28.565 --> 01:08:29.605]  Thank you for joining us today.
[01:08:29.605 --> 01:08:35.729]  This is Mike Adams, the health ranger, filling in for Alex today on this Friday, March 1st.
[01:08:35.729 --> 01:08:36.609]  It is March 1st.
[01:08:36.609 --> 01:08:38.430]  It's amazing how time flies.
[01:08:38.430 --> 01:08:39.051]  2013!
[01:08:39.051 --> 01:08:42.152]  Yeah, we all survived 2012.
[01:08:42.152 --> 01:08:43.213]  Yes, we did.
[01:08:43.213 --> 01:08:47.035]  Just like we said here on the show, you know, the Mayan calendar thing was a non-issue.
[01:08:47.515 --> 01:08:48.876]  We said that!
[01:08:48.876 --> 01:08:49.877]  Over and over again!
[01:08:49.877 --> 01:08:55.521]  And people still said that Alex Jones was saying the world would end on December 21st.
[01:08:55.521 --> 01:08:57.522]  No, he didn't!
[01:08:57.522 --> 01:09:00.965]  I'm always amazed by how the media says Alex said something that he never said.
[01:09:02.664 --> 01:09:04.205]  He's become like the scapegoat.
[01:09:04.205 --> 01:09:16.515]  Whenever they want to say that somebody said something crazy, they make something up like, oh yeah, somebody out there said lizard people were invading the Library of Congress.
[01:09:16.515 --> 01:09:18.497]  Must have been Alex Jones, they say.
[01:09:18.497 --> 01:09:24.421]  They just come up with whatever crazy stuff they come up with, they blame Alex.
[01:09:24.421 --> 01:09:28.144]  And I listen to every broadcast, not in real time, I listen to it later.
[01:09:29.555 --> 01:09:41.485]  So I hear what Alex says, and I know the mainstream media is full of bunk on that, so you're getting it here from another independent, verified source that Alex did not say the world was going to end on December 21st!
[01:09:41.485 --> 01:09:44.708]  He said it's a non-issue, and he was right, once again.
[01:09:44.708 --> 01:09:46.229]  He also warned you about the drones.
[01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:51.754]  He warned you about the robot warriors that the military is putting together.
[01:09:51.754 --> 01:09:53.055]  He warned you about all that stuff.
[01:09:53.055 --> 01:09:55.197]  Anyway, today is a milestone day.
[01:09:56.568 --> 01:09:57.789]  And here's why.
[01:09:57.789 --> 01:10:05.457]  The entire Health Ranger Select product line is now going to be in the InfoWars store.
[01:10:06.621 --> 01:10:09.521]  So if you want to check it out, go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:10:09.521 --> 01:10:16.403]  But just, you may not even know my history, but briefly, I used to be borderline diabetic.
[01:10:16.403 --> 01:10:19.043]  Borderline obese.
[01:10:19.043 --> 01:10:20.383]  I suffered from chronic pain.
[01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:21.564]  I had high cholesterol.
[01:10:21.564 --> 01:10:23.584]  This was when I was about 30 years old.
[01:10:23.584 --> 01:10:29.985]  And I'd grown up eating, well not grown up, but throughout my 20s, you know, I got on a real bad diet.
[01:10:29.985 --> 01:10:33.646]  You know, junk food, processed food, wasn't exercising, all that.
[01:10:33.646 --> 01:10:35.366]  I was in real bad shape by the time I was age 30.
[01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:41.052]  And I got healthy by turning to foods and nutrition, and that's how I became the Health Ranger.
[01:10:41.052 --> 01:10:43.773]  That's where my nickname comes from, in case you're wondering.
[01:10:43.773 --> 01:10:54.578]  And then I started Natural News and began educating others and built that to, you know, now a massive information network, five million unique visitors a month over there.
[01:10:54.578 --> 01:11:01.541]  And recently we started sourcing products that are totally non-GMO, not from China,
[01:11:02.521 --> 01:11:16.152]  Pristine, well-researched superfoods and supplements, and just the best of the best that we could find all over the place, all over the world, except China, because I don't like buying things from China.
[01:11:16.152 --> 01:11:17.453]  And we got certified organic.
[01:11:17.453 --> 01:11:19.835]  We have a certified organic facility here in Texas.
[01:11:19.835 --> 01:11:21.276]  Alex asked me, he said, Mike,
[01:11:22.057 --> 01:11:29.926]  You got to make this stuff available to InfoWars listeners and then they can also help support the broadcast through the InfoWars store.
[01:11:29.926 --> 01:11:35.412]  So would you be willing to bring that in and offer us that at wholesale prices?
[01:11:35.412 --> 01:11:37.475]  And I said, yeah, sure, let's do it.
[01:11:37.475 --> 01:11:38.076]  Let's make it happen.
[01:11:38.576 --> 01:11:49.160]  As of today, that's happening, and we have turmeric extract, a very potent turmeric that is the most potent turmeric extract made with organic turmeric.
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:50.020]  That's available now.
[01:11:50.020 --> 01:11:51.981]  We've got clean chlorella.
[01:11:51.981 --> 01:11:55.442]  We researched all the chlorella superfood everywhere around the world.
[01:11:55.442 --> 01:11:56.643]  We did the lab test.
[01:11:56.643 --> 01:11:59.204]  We found the two cleanest sources in the world.
[01:11:59.204 --> 01:12:01.445]  This is the number one cleanest source right here.
[01:12:01.445 --> 01:12:04.566]  Clean chlorella comes out of South Korea, actually.
[01:12:05.106 --> 01:12:08.548]  The chlorella is not grown in the USA, by the way, so you gotta go outside the country.
[01:12:08.548 --> 01:12:15.831]  And then right now we have fine ground Himalayan salt, a full-spectrum, full-bodied salt loaded with trace minerals.
[01:12:15.831 --> 01:12:16.771]  So that's available.
[01:12:16.771 --> 01:12:18.752]  Just go to InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:12:18.752 --> 01:12:25.675]  Your purchase helps support the InfoWars broadcast, and I'm just happy to be part of it, to be able to bring these great products.
[01:12:25.675 --> 01:12:26.536]  We've got more coming.
[01:12:27.580 --> 01:12:29.262]  All non-GMO.
[01:12:29.262 --> 01:12:36.691]  I'm the kind of guy who goes to sources and says, you can't have hidden maltodextrin in the fruit powders.
[01:12:36.691 --> 01:12:40.315]  You can't have heavy metals in the product.
[01:12:40.315 --> 01:12:42.238]  Otherwise, I won't even put my name on it.
[01:12:42.238 --> 01:12:43.880]  So, cleanest of the clean.
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:45.261]  And by the way, speaking of clean food,
[01:12:45.902 --> 01:12:49.806]  Enterfood, the full product line of Enterfood is available in the InfoWars store.
[01:12:49.806 --> 01:12:54.911]  Enterfood, just to confirm, they don't source any ingredients from China either.
[01:12:54.911 --> 01:12:56.132]  Nothing from China.
[01:12:56.132 --> 01:13:03.919]  Enterfood, just one of the very top, most amazing superfoods out there, the full product line at the InfoWars store.
[01:13:03.919 --> 01:13:06.081]  So again, thank you for supporting the broadcast.
[01:13:07.202 --> 01:13:10.184]  You might wonder why all of us are really all about nutrition these days.
[01:13:10.184 --> 01:13:12.545]  It's because we're trying to survive.
[01:13:12.545 --> 01:13:18.389]  We're trying to survive the toxic poisons, the GMOs, the fluoride in the water.
[01:13:18.389 --> 01:13:22.171]  We're trying to make it through all this with our brains intact.
[01:13:22.771 --> 01:13:25.673]  And our fertility intact and our bodies intact.
[01:13:25.673 --> 01:13:27.354]  And speaking of food news, check this out.
[01:13:27.354 --> 01:13:32.518]  Taco Bell now finds traces of horse meat in its UK products.
[01:13:32.518 --> 01:13:40.804]  Now, you heard about horse meat last week and the week before, I think, but this is Taco Bell now saying traces of horse meat in some of its products on sale in the UK.
[01:13:40.804 --> 01:13:43.586]  Now, look, I have a different take on this.
[01:13:43.586 --> 01:13:45.848]  A lot of people are freaked out by horse meat in their food.
[01:13:46.778 --> 01:13:47.718]  What?
[01:13:47.718 --> 01:13:48.559]  Are you kidding me?
[01:13:48.559 --> 01:13:51.440]  Horse meat is perfectly healthy for you.
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:14:02.544]  The stuff you really need to be worried about is the MSG, the GMO, the aspartame, the sodium nitrate, the chemical additives, the heavy metals that are in a lot of these foods.
[01:14:02.544 --> 01:14:07.966]  I don't care about a little horse meat in a Taco Bell taco.
[01:14:07.966 --> 01:14:10.567]  Not that I even eat at Taco Bell anyway.
[01:14:10.567 --> 01:14:13.268]  But if I did, I wouldn't care about a little horse meat in there.
[01:14:13.268 --> 01:14:15.829]  What I would be worried about are the other chemicals.
[01:14:16.169 --> 01:14:26.137]  I mean, let's face it, you know, horse meat, even though, you know, morally and ethically, you might say, well, I don't want to eat horses, but there's nothing nutritionally dangerous in horse meat.
[01:14:26.137 --> 01:14:30.220]  If you eat meat from a cow, you can eat meat from a horse, folks.
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:34.944]  There's virtually no nutritional difference, really, when it comes down to it.
[01:14:34.944 --> 01:14:38.527]  Horse meat's a little more lean, but there's nothing wrong with horse meat in it.
[01:14:39.304 --> 01:14:42.225]  I'd be more worried about the other stuff.
[01:14:42.225 --> 01:14:43.785]  The chemicals that are in the food.
[01:14:43.785 --> 01:14:46.486]  That's what would be worrying me.
[01:14:46.486 --> 01:14:49.506]  Because the stuff that's in your food is what's killing you.
[01:14:49.506 --> 01:14:50.386]  Right?
[01:14:50.386 --> 01:14:57.668]  And here joining us to help us understand this message even more is Ashell Eldridge.
[01:14:57.668 --> 01:14:59.848]  Seasons is his nickname.
[01:14:59.848 --> 01:15:01.729]  And this guy is amazing.
[01:15:02.469 --> 01:15:03.990]  I saw his music video.
[01:15:03.990 --> 01:15:05.070]  It's called Food Fight.
[01:15:05.070 --> 01:15:06.771]  Look for it on YouTube.
[01:15:06.771 --> 01:15:08.972]  He's from a group called Earth Amplified.
[01:15:08.972 --> 01:15:11.093]  He's a spiritual warrior.
[01:15:11.093 --> 01:15:14.795]  He's a warrior of truth and food justice.
[01:15:14.795 --> 01:15:25.000]  This video speaks to the inner city kids who are growing up on junk food and processed food and energy drinks and what they need to be turning to is real nutrition.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:29.102]  Ashelle Eldridge joins us right now on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:29.102 --> 01:15:30.402]  Ashelle, thank you for joining us.
[01:15:30.402 --> 01:15:31.503]  It's a pleasure to have you on.
[01:15:34.635 --> 01:15:35.336]  Well thank you.
[01:15:35.336 --> 01:15:36.918]  Thank you for what you do too.
[01:15:36.918 --> 01:15:43.206]  How has the reaction been so far to your to your food fight video?
[01:15:43.206 --> 01:15:44.888]  You able to hear me?
[01:15:47.199 --> 01:15:48.580]  All right.
[01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:50.041]  I think he's not hearing me.
[01:15:50.041 --> 01:15:52.203]  Well, let me know when we got that connection going up.
[01:15:52.203 --> 01:15:54.864]  But if you want to check it out, folks, it's Food Fight.
[01:15:54.864 --> 01:15:58.887]  The video is up on YouTube right now.
[01:15:58.887 --> 01:16:01.029]  We did a review of it on Natural News.
[01:16:01.029 --> 01:16:04.311]  If you want to check that out, this is a powerful message.
[01:16:04.311 --> 01:16:05.532]  It talks about the Matrix.
[01:16:05.532 --> 01:16:07.133]  It talks about the GMOs.
[01:16:07.133 --> 01:16:08.774]  It talks about aspartame.
[01:16:08.774 --> 01:16:13.477]  And it's just a very uplifting, empowering message from a very talented artist.
[01:16:13.477 --> 01:16:13.938]  Are we good now?
[01:16:15.359 --> 01:16:17.200]  All right, we're going to come back to Ashel.
[01:16:17.200 --> 01:16:19.020]  All right, we're getting back on.
[01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:22.362]  But anyway, the point is that these foods are what's really killing us.
[01:16:22.362 --> 01:16:29.725]  So you've got a government that tries to say, well, we want to keep you safe from a shooting, so we want to take away those rights.
[01:16:29.725 --> 01:16:37.588]  Or we want to keep you safe, like Mayor Bloomberg does in New York, from soda, so we're going to ban large soda drinks.
[01:16:38.428 --> 01:16:44.833]  Or, you know, we want to keep you safe from this or that, X, Y, and Z. The list never ends.
[01:16:44.833 --> 01:16:46.414]  And the rules never end.
[01:16:46.414 --> 01:16:51.298]  And what you end up with is a society where it's a police state of total safety.
[01:16:51.298 --> 01:16:54.260]  Oh yeah, you're safe now because you're not allowed to leave your house.
[01:16:54.260 --> 01:16:56.221]  You're not allowed to turn on the internet.
[01:16:56.221 --> 01:16:59.583]  You're not allowed to go to non-approved websites.
[01:16:59.583 --> 01:17:00.985]  Might be something risky there.
[01:17:00.985 --> 01:17:02.205]  Risky information.
[01:17:02.205 --> 01:17:05.168]  Or you're not allowed to buy raw cheese, raw dairy.
[01:17:05.948 --> 01:17:07.349]  You're not allowed to do anything.
[01:17:07.349 --> 01:17:10.812]  Hey, in Oregon, you're not even allowed to collect rainwater in your field.
[01:17:10.812 --> 01:17:16.536]  They sent a guy to jail for 30 days there just for collecting rainwater.
[01:17:16.536 --> 01:17:22.280]  So, they want to sell you on the idea of safety while they're really enslaving you.
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:29.005]  And, hey, you know, Hitler created a society that was really, really safe if you weren't targeted by Hitler.
[01:17:29.867 --> 01:17:30.487]  Right?
[01:17:30.487 --> 01:17:41.692]  I mean, that was the goal for him, to create an amazing society, a golden age of amazing citizens who are, you know, the most upstanding human beings of all.
[01:17:41.692 --> 01:17:46.114]  And he wanted to create a super safe society, but of course it was a nightmare.
[01:17:46.114 --> 01:17:49.915]  So don't fall for that idea that safety creates abundance.
[01:17:49.915 --> 01:17:50.575]  It doesn't.
[01:17:50.575 --> 01:17:52.676]  And we've got Achelle back on the line.
[01:17:52.676 --> 01:17:53.917]  He couldn't hear me the last time.
[01:17:53.917 --> 01:17:56.518]  Achelle Eldridge, known as Seasons,
[01:17:57.458 --> 01:17:58.759]  Yeah, thanks for inviting me.
[01:17:58.759 --> 01:18:00.660]  Yeah, the reaction is amazing.
[01:18:20.509 --> 01:18:25.212]  We're getting response from people all around the world, actually, who've seen this video.
[01:18:25.212 --> 01:18:30.636]  People in South Africa who are doing an agriculture project with youth.
[01:18:30.636 --> 01:18:39.743]  Moms in Philadelphia who are, you know, just upset with the food system and what their children are being fed in schools.
[01:18:39.743 --> 01:18:42.265]  People who are, you know, crying, essentially.
[01:18:42.265 --> 01:18:45.027]  It was like, you know, I'm a family farmer in Ireland.
[01:18:45.934 --> 01:18:55.597]  And I sort of gave up on what I was working on, and this video inspired me again to get back out there and make sure that people have a healthy food.
[01:18:55.597 --> 01:18:56.277]  Yeah.
[01:18:56.277 --> 01:18:57.597]  It's really inspiring.
[01:18:57.597 --> 01:19:01.779]  Your video is very, very inspiring.
[01:19:01.779 --> 01:19:04.559]  What motivated you to do this?
[01:19:04.559 --> 01:19:07.920]  I mean, were you seeing so many people harmed by processed foods or what?
[01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:08.961]  How did you decide to take this on?
[01:19:08.961 --> 01:19:09.601]  It's a big project.
[01:19:10.680 --> 01:19:14.362]  Yeah, well I worked with the organization Green For All.
[01:19:14.362 --> 01:19:18.465]  We worked on some sort of green jobs and I was their spotlight organizer.
[01:19:18.465 --> 01:19:34.655]  So I went around the country and I saw a lot of communities dealing with nutrition issues, dealing with diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and at the same time a lot of people really
[01:19:35.589 --> 01:19:37.551]  Doing it on our own, growing our own food.
[01:19:37.551 --> 01:19:42.636]  And there were small-pocketed people where they wanted to make it in the same amount of press and have the same amount of push.
[01:19:42.636 --> 01:19:44.658]  So, I educated myself.
[01:19:44.658 --> 01:19:45.719]  Stay with us, Ashell.
[01:19:45.719 --> 01:19:46.340]  Sorry to interrupt.
[01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:48.142]  We've got to go to a quick break, but stay with us.
[01:19:48.142 --> 01:19:51.365]  I've got a lot more questions for you on the other side of this break.
[01:19:51.365 --> 01:19:56.870]  It's Ashell Eldridge, Seasons, from the Food Fight video.
[01:19:56.870 --> 01:19:58.151]  He's with us on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:19:58.151 --> 01:19:59.573]  We'll be right back with a lot more.
[01:20:01.107 --> 01:20:04.488]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[01:20:04.488 --> 01:20:10.510]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:20:10.510 --> 01:20:14.371]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[01:20:14.371 --> 01:20:15.952]  Check out SimpliSafe.
[01:20:15.952 --> 01:20:20.393]  It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.
[01:20:20.393 --> 01:20:22.414]  Go to GetSimpliSafe.com.

[01:20:25.794 --> 01:20:30.157]  It runs on battery power, so even if the grid goes down, you're protected.

[01:20:36.781 --> 01:20:39.102]  Get SimpliSafe.com.

[01:20:57.507 --> 01:20:59.670]  Again, that's GetSimpliSafe.com
[01:21:00.768 --> 01:21:03.150]  We've lived in this neighborhood for years.
[01:21:03.150 --> 01:21:06.692]  We have an alarm system and all of our doors have deadbolts.
[01:21:06.692 --> 01:21:10.655]  They kicked in our door and were in and out of our house in about 5 minutes.
[01:21:10.655 --> 01:21:16.559]  The police arrived in about 20 minutes, but they were long gone with our TV, jewelry, and my guns.
[01:21:16.559 --> 01:21:19.461]  I kept thinking, what if my family had been home?
[01:21:19.461 --> 01:21:26.426]  The police officer said that more than 85% of break-ins are through a door, and that deadbolts alone don't stop intruders.
[01:21:26.986 --> 01:21:32.870]  The officer told me to go to EasyArmor.net if we wanted something that would actually stop an intruder.
[01:21:32.870 --> 01:21:38.973]  EasyArmor reinforces all of the weak points on your doors and is guaranteed to prevent kick-ins.
[01:21:38.973 --> 01:21:44.437]  I was surprised at how little EasyArmor costs, and I installed EasyArmor in about 30 minutes.
[01:21:45.017 --> 01:21:46.618]  Visit EasyArmor.net.
[01:21:46.618 --> 01:21:49.780]  That's the letters E-Z-A-R-M-O-R.net.
[01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:50.681]  Or call 888-58-ARMOR.
[01:21:50.681 --> 01:21:51.181]  That's 888-582-7667.
[01:21:51.181 --> 01:21:51.902]  EasyArmor.net.
[01:21:51.902 --> 01:21:53.303]  Ultimate door security made easy.
[01:21:59.835 --> 01:22:03.236]  Nagging constipation, hemorrhoids, or painful bowel movements?
[01:22:03.236 --> 01:22:05.336]  Have you considered your toilet posture?
[01:22:05.336 --> 01:22:09.097]  The colon needs proper alignment for faster, more effective elimination.
[01:22:09.097 --> 01:22:11.877]  And that's exactly what you'll get with a Squatty Potty.
[01:22:11.877 --> 01:22:18.538]  Not a cleanse or a pill, the Squatty Potty is a healthy step in the right direction, is doctor recommended, and starts at just $34.95.

[01:22:29.893 --> 01:22:31.113]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:31.113 --> 01:22:35.595]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[01:22:35.595 --> 01:22:41.317]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:41.317 --> 01:22:44.898]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:44.898 --> 01:22:47.579]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:47.579 --> 01:22:52.561]  Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns.
[01:22:52.561 --> 01:22:52.801]  Call 800-686-2237.
[01:22:52.801 --> 01:22:54.161]  Secure your future and call 1-800-686-2237.
[01:22:59.523 --> 01:23:00.584]  Social unrest.
[01:23:00.584 --> 01:23:01.604]  Food shortages.
[01:23:01.604 --> 01:23:02.784]  Political turmoil.
[01:23:02.784 --> 01:23:03.765]  EMPs.
[01:23:03.765 --> 01:23:04.465]  Earthquakes.
[01:23:04.465 --> 01:23:05.246]  Tornadoes.
[01:23:05.246 --> 01:23:06.066]  Hurricanes.
[01:23:06.066 --> 01:23:06.706]  Fires.
[01:23:06.706 --> 01:23:07.286]  Riots.
[01:23:07.286 --> 01:23:07.907]  Flooding.
[01:23:07.907 --> 01:23:09.847]  It's not a matter of if, but when.
[01:23:09.847 --> 01:23:11.228]  What if it happened right now?
[01:23:11.228 --> 01:23:14.129]  Would you have the supplies to survive Off The Grid?

[01:24:05.939 --> 01:24:19.364]  I hear the train a-comin' It's rollin' around the bend And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when I'm stuck in Folsom Prison And time keeps draggin' on
[01:24:23.460 --> 01:24:29.023]  Alright, we're back on the Alex Jones Show, an interview with Achelle Seasons.
[01:24:29.023 --> 01:24:31.765]  Eldridge, I think I got the order right there, sorry.
[01:24:31.765 --> 01:24:33.285]  I was mispronouncing his name earlier.
[01:24:33.285 --> 01:24:35.827]  I didn't have a chance to talk to him before the show.
[01:24:35.827 --> 01:24:44.832]  But real quick, before we go back to Achelle, the new issue of Infowars Magazine is out, and the cover is an American flag.
[01:24:45.692 --> 01:24:49.394]  With the topic of Civil War II.
[01:24:49.394 --> 01:24:51.334]  Is that what's coming?
[01:24:51.334 --> 01:24:52.675]  Hopefully not.
[01:24:52.675 --> 01:24:54.696]  But the issue's out.
[01:24:54.696 --> 01:24:56.557]  You can get the issue at the InfoWars store.
[01:24:56.557 --> 01:24:57.437]  You can subscribe.
[01:24:57.437 --> 01:25:01.639]  This is a beautiful, glossy print magazine.
[01:25:01.639 --> 01:25:03.279]  It's got all kinds of content in it.
[01:25:03.279 --> 01:25:05.700]  Check it out at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:25:05.700 --> 01:25:07.361]  This is awesome.
[01:25:07.361 --> 01:25:13.624]  Other magazines are going out of print, but we here at the Freedom side of things are getting into print.
[01:25:14.696 --> 01:25:25.949]  And speaking of the main topic here, civil war, you know, like I said earlier, the systems of control that exist in our world, they want to get the people fighting with each other, especially fighting among racial lines.
[01:25:25.949 --> 01:25:30.754]  They want to pit black against white and Latino against white and everybody else.
[01:25:30.754 --> 01:25:33.917]  They just want people fighting with each other so that they're not fighting the system.
[01:25:36.886 --> 01:25:40.309]  And this artist, Achelle, he understands that.
[01:25:40.309 --> 01:25:52.139]  He understands that it's about the people fighting for, with their brothers and sisters and fellow human beings, fighting for freedom against the system.
[01:25:52.139 --> 01:25:52.880]  So remember that.
[01:25:52.880 --> 01:25:56.463]  It's always about the people versus the corporate fascist government system.
[01:25:57.406 --> 01:26:01.468]  Now, what we really want as a free people is we want to be left alone, largely.
[01:26:01.468 --> 01:26:07.190]  We want to have basic freedoms and basic rights that can never be touched by any system of government.
[01:26:07.190 --> 01:26:09.011]  And that's what the Bill of Rights is.
[01:26:09.011 --> 01:26:12.872]  The Bill of Rights is supposed to be non-negotiable.
[01:26:12.872 --> 01:26:17.674]  In fact, let me see if I can find this quote on it here.
[01:26:17.674 --> 01:26:18.034]  Here it is.
[01:26:18.034 --> 01:26:23.757]  It's a great article out of Investors.com by Thomas Sowell.
[01:26:24.949 --> 01:26:30.772]  Where he talks about the fact that, yeah, people make mistakes, but government makes deadly errors.
[01:26:30.772 --> 01:26:32.872]  This is his article.
[01:26:32.872 --> 01:26:46.639]  And, you know, the whole theory of government is that there is a group of elite people at the top who are wiser and smarter than everybody else and they should tell us what to do and what to eat and how to live our lives.
[01:26:47.859 --> 01:26:58.147]  And it turns out that individuals are smarter than those systems, especially when those systems are corporate control systems, which is what we see in the food system, the medical system, and so on.
[01:26:58.147 --> 01:27:08.715]  And so again, getting back to Achelle, a guy who really gets that, he understands that this is about people fighting alongside people for people freedom, individual freedom against the system.
[01:27:08.715 --> 01:27:11.337]  He gets that, and his music video, Food Fight, is of course
[01:27:12.017 --> 01:27:13.198]  Yeah, you know, I'm from Chicago originally.
[01:27:13.198 --> 01:27:16.099]  My grandmother, you know, she passed away from diabetes when I was eight years old.
[01:27:16.099 --> 01:27:18.701]  So, just witnessing that and then going deeper in the investigation of
[01:27:33.778 --> 01:27:34.359]  I don't know.
[01:27:52.205 --> 01:28:03.051]  I wanted to reclaim that art form and really communicate to young people so that they have this awareness around what's against them in a lot of ways.
[01:28:03.051 --> 01:28:03.451]  Yeah.
[01:28:03.451 --> 01:28:10.054]  And also how they can empower themselves, liberate themselves through their food, through growing their food, and it's just being healthy.
[01:28:10.054 --> 01:28:11.695]  Getting the earth inside of them.
[01:28:11.695 --> 01:28:15.697]  So that's why we created SOSQ, System Out of Your System.
[01:28:15.697 --> 01:28:17.658]  It's a non-profit, for-profit hybrid.
[01:28:18.331 --> 01:28:18.791]  We're good to go.
[01:28:42.358 --> 01:28:44.980]  Being efficient is falling apart all over the place.
[01:28:44.980 --> 01:28:49.263]  We gotta create some food sovereignty and start taking responsibility for ourselves.
[01:28:51.745 --> 01:28:54.187]  I watched your video several times.
[01:28:54.187 --> 01:29:03.953]  I don't know how deeply you touch on this issue, but I'm sure you get this, that, you know, you come from Chicago, and that's a city that's wracked by violence.
[01:29:03.953 --> 01:29:09.837]  But there's a link between violence and what you might call violent food or processed food, dead food.
[01:29:09.837 --> 01:29:20.104]  If you grow up, if you are fed these kinds of chemicals and these refined, adulterated foods, you become less of a person who can get along in society.
[01:29:21.465 --> 01:29:21.926]  Exactly.
[01:29:21.926 --> 01:29:25.990]  No, that's exactly right.
[01:29:25.990 --> 01:29:31.696]  I mean, so in taking responsibility for our health, we take responsibility for our wealth and our future.
[01:29:31.696 --> 01:29:36.200]  I mean, if your immune system is weak, you know, you really can't...
[01:29:38.260 --> 01:29:38.981]  Yeah.
[01:29:38.981 --> 01:29:44.024]  Seasons, will you stay with us again through one more break and then we'll have a long segment on the other side.
[01:29:44.024 --> 01:29:44.925]  Stay with us.
[01:29:44.925 --> 01:29:49.648]  We'll be right back on the Alex Jones Show with more about the fight for food justice in America.
[01:29:49.648 --> 01:29:50.048]  Stay with us.
[01:29:50.048 --> 01:29:51.389]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.389 --> 01:29:53.010]  The empire's on the run.

[01:33:13.334 --> 01:33:14.674]  All right, more cowbell, folks.
[01:33:14.674 --> 01:33:16.855]  There we go.
[01:33:16.855 --> 01:33:19.016]  More cowbell!
[01:33:19.016 --> 01:33:22.077]  Yeah, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:33:22.077 --> 01:33:26.698]  And we're joined by Achelle Seasons Eldridge, the creator of Food Fight.
[01:33:26.698 --> 01:33:30.779]  We've got a long segment here now, so no more commercial interruptions for a while.
[01:33:30.779 --> 01:33:32.339]  Achelle, I wanted to ask you about this.
[01:33:32.339 --> 01:33:37.421]  You know, what really intrigued me about your music video, Food Fight, is that it's a message
[01:33:38.001 --> 01:33:43.426]  To the inner city communities, it's a message that we don't often hear, you know.
[01:33:43.426 --> 01:33:56.116]  In terms of how this plays out in terms of race, we often see, you know, the super sort of stringent food purists, you know, tend to be
[01:33:56.917 --> 01:33:58.198]  A lot of white folks.
[01:33:58.198 --> 01:34:05.525]  And then the Latino communities, they're having diabetes problems because no one's telling them that drinking all this soda is giving you diabetes.
[01:34:05.525 --> 01:34:16.576]  And then the African American communities are dying from breast cancer and prostate cancer because nobody's telling them that dark skin pigmentation blocks vitamin D and if you're deficient in vitamin D you're going to get cancer.
[01:34:16.576 --> 01:34:16.976]  And it's like...
[01:34:18.038 --> 01:34:22.779]  Your message is speaking to this, and it's desperately needed.
[01:34:22.779 --> 01:34:26.740]  Are you getting comments about the importance of what you're doing?
[01:34:26.740 --> 01:34:29.361]  Yeah, definitely getting a lot of comments.
[01:34:29.361 --> 01:34:40.523]  I mean, I'm not sure about the details around me, the skin pigmentation, but I think that, you know, and also, you know, big ups to Ben Zolno, New Message Media.
[01:34:40.523 --> 01:34:46.845]  I worked on a couple of projects with him around, like, standing plastic bags, for example, plastic data mine.
[01:34:47.310 --> 01:34:51.113]  There's a huge community of people around the country who are working on this issue of food justice.
[01:34:51.113 --> 01:34:56.058]  I think that where we're at is just a crucial moment.
[01:34:56.058 --> 01:35:00.782]  A lot of people are just waking up to the fact that they're sick and tired, and they're tired of being sick and tired.
[01:35:00.782 --> 01:35:01.643]  Right, right.
[01:35:01.643 --> 01:35:07.007]  You know, the hospital bills are off the chain, and we're losing people left and right.
[01:35:07.007 --> 01:35:08.949]  Sure, we're losing people to a war abroad.
[01:35:08.949 --> 01:35:13.373]  We're losing people in a lot of different ways, but one thing I think that
[01:35:14.361 --> 01:35:23.445]  We have that I think is a unifying factor for a lot of people across different cultures even, is the food.
[01:35:23.445 --> 01:35:35.871]  So obviously we see, I mean if you look at the statistics, advertisements around, you know, name your stock, name your fast food chain, they're definitely placed in these low-income communities.
[01:35:35.871 --> 01:35:37.212]  So I mean I see that as a
[01:35:38.180 --> 01:35:42.682]  As an individual who's done a lot of organizing and stuff like that, I see that as intentional in a lot of ways.
[01:35:42.682 --> 01:35:48.745]  But also at the same time, I see it as something that can be brought down once you bring awareness to it.
[01:35:48.745 --> 01:35:53.688]  So as an artist, I think it's our responsibility to be on the front lines a little bit, energetically at least.
[01:35:54.335 --> 01:35:54.795]  We're good to go!
[01:36:23.268 --> 01:36:23.868]  That's right.
[01:36:23.868 --> 01:36:24.229]  That's right.
[01:36:47.881 --> 01:36:51.782]  Well, that's where the power really comes from, is the individual power.
[01:36:51.782 --> 01:37:01.706]  And what I like about your videos, it shows individuals making choices instead of eating the processed food, which really enslaves all of us, no matter what our racial background.
[01:37:01.706 --> 01:37:08.929]  We are all enslaved in a system of disease and health care, or sick care, actually, if we live our lives consuming those processed foods.
[01:37:08.929 --> 01:37:17.092]  So if we want to be free people, empowered people, capable people, we have to make that individual choice every single day about what we put into our mouths.
[01:37:18.942 --> 01:37:20.463]  I mean, you get that.
[01:37:20.463 --> 01:37:26.248]  And also, your video depicts inner-city folks making that choice.
[01:37:26.248 --> 01:37:32.953]  But a lot of people living in the suburbs, they think that anybody can just go down and buy organic food anywhere.
[01:37:32.953 --> 01:37:38.457]  But in the inner-city areas, you can't just get organic food very easily.
[01:37:38.457 --> 01:37:42.180]  What's available there is mostly just processed garbage.
[01:37:43.271 --> 01:37:43.671]  Exactly.
[01:37:43.671 --> 01:37:50.374]  So yeah, we did the studies and actually people, if there's better food available, people would take the better food.
[01:37:50.374 --> 01:37:51.314]  Yes.
[01:37:51.314 --> 01:37:54.136]  We've done the studies, the research is out there.
[01:37:54.136 --> 01:37:57.257]  It's not just that people are somehow inclined to wanting
[01:37:57.952 --> 01:37:58.232]  Right.
[01:37:58.232 --> 01:37:58.632]  Right.
[01:38:27.507 --> 01:38:29.728]  Yeah, well food is a chemical warfare delivery system.
[01:38:55.049 --> 01:38:56.471]  Right, right, exactly.
[01:38:56.471 --> 01:39:01.878]  So, you know, we totally wanted to point that out and do it in a way that has humor in it so people can actually swallow it down.
[01:39:06.434 --> 01:39:13.980]  You know, and just encourage people, because I know a lot of people wake up to this stuff and want to make sure that folks knew that we had their back.
[01:39:13.980 --> 01:39:19.824]  And, obviously, at this point, we're creating more organization around it as we're building more teammates.
[01:39:19.824 --> 01:39:27.590]  Yeah, and what's a website where people can... I'm sorry, but what website can people go to to learn more about the curriculum and everything else that follows the video?
[01:39:27.590 --> 01:39:28.311]  What's the site?
[01:39:28.311 --> 01:39:29.171]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:39:29.171 --> 01:39:30.873]  SOSJuice.com.
[01:39:30.873 --> 01:39:32.214]  SOSJuice.com.
[01:39:32.214 --> 01:39:34.135]  SOSJuice.com, yeah.
[01:39:34.135 --> 01:39:34.876]  Power to people.
[01:39:35.547 --> 01:39:37.529]  And it's been amazing to see the curriculum, too.
[01:39:37.529 --> 01:39:41.071]  I mean, Vanessa Carter, our teammate, came on and said, you know what?
[01:39:41.071 --> 01:39:48.196]  She works at the Arsenal Arts and Ecology Center, and they do have some of the oldest, right here in California, the oldest organic farms.
[01:39:49.167 --> 01:39:50.047]  We're good to go.
[01:40:18.300 --> 01:40:25.306]  Well, I love the message.
[01:40:25.306 --> 01:40:26.307]  I love what you're doing there.
[01:40:26.307 --> 01:40:36.996]  I love how you've chosen this path of spiritual truth instead of just the typical commercially driven, you know, gangster rap, whatever that we see coming out of so many artists who take that path.
[01:40:36.996 --> 01:40:41.961]  You've chosen a path of enlightenment, you know, a path of spiritual truth.
[01:40:41.961 --> 01:40:43.722]  I also want to share this with you, you know.
[01:40:44.483 --> 01:40:52.487]  We've covered and documented how the medical system specifically targets African-Americans for more disease, especially more cancer.
[01:40:52.487 --> 01:40:58.790]  Did you know that, for example, breast cancer is more aggressive in African-American women than in white women?
[01:40:58.790 --> 01:40:59.390]  Did you know that?
[01:40:59.390 --> 01:41:00.971]  Right.
[01:41:00.971 --> 01:41:03.712]  And they won't tell those women why.
[01:41:03.712 --> 01:41:06.914]  And the reason is because of the vitamin D deficiency.
[01:41:06.914 --> 01:41:08.455]  They did a big study in Chicago.
[01:41:08.455 --> 01:41:11.236]  They had, I think, 300 nurses and medical professionals
[01:41:11.476 --> 01:41:11.916]  We're good to go.
[01:41:41.495 --> 01:41:42.196]  It's a crime!
[01:41:42.196 --> 01:41:44.237]  Well, this is great.
[01:41:44.237 --> 01:41:50.100]  I mean, that's why I love, you know, I'm being Alex Jones every now and then.
[01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:51.861]  I pick up on national news.
[01:41:51.861 --> 01:41:53.642]  And, yeah, I mean, information.
[01:41:53.642 --> 01:41:54.762]  It's the information age.
[01:41:54.762 --> 01:41:57.404]  I mean, definitely just keep sharing it.
[01:41:57.404 --> 01:41:58.584]  I mean, it's a lot for me to learn.
[01:41:58.584 --> 01:41:59.805]  It's a lot for the public to learn.
[01:41:59.805 --> 01:42:01.386]  And I just hope everyone has an open mind.
[01:42:02.105 --> 01:42:02.265]  Yeah.
[01:42:02.265 --> 01:42:02.405]  Yeah.
[01:42:26.104 --> 01:42:26.745]  That's amazing.
[01:42:26.745 --> 01:42:29.787]  So, what's next for you then?
[01:42:29.787 --> 01:42:31.788]  I mean, this project is already a success.
[01:42:31.788 --> 01:42:36.892]  I think your first YouTube video goal was only a few thousand views.
[01:42:36.892 --> 01:42:38.634]  You hit that in no time.
[01:42:38.634 --> 01:42:40.555]  Now, how many, is it up to 100,000 yet now?
[01:42:40.555 --> 01:42:44.418]  Yeah, I think it's at 100,000 right now, maybe like four days.
[01:42:44.418 --> 01:42:45.119]  Awesome.
[01:42:45.119 --> 01:42:52.985]  Again, that's, you know, that's a combination of, you know, the artistry and showing your attention, which all the artists out there, like, really doing the research.
[01:42:53.852 --> 01:43:05.575]  Really connecting with the earth and connecting with the heart of the people and the heart of the universe and really actually saying like, yo, we want to deliver something to actually speak to people on a soul level.
[01:43:05.575 --> 01:43:06.895]  And the intention actually played out.
[01:43:06.895 --> 01:43:09.676]  So to me, this is sort of validation.
[01:43:09.676 --> 01:43:17.578]  And I think where we're going with it, essentially, we have no choice at this point because we have the energy to do it and the
[01:43:18.424 --> 01:43:19.004]  We're good to go.
[01:43:36.273 --> 01:43:37.475]  We're good to go.
[01:43:56.756 --> 01:43:56.976]  I'm good.
[01:44:08.055 --> 01:44:11.057]  I love how you're teaching people to grow food, too.
[01:44:11.057 --> 01:44:12.337]  I think that's so crucial.
[01:44:12.337 --> 01:44:15.799]  And that's an issue of freedom for everybody across America.
[01:44:15.799 --> 01:44:20.261]  This is why, you know, we cover farm freedom, the farms are being suppressed, the food is being suppressed.
[01:44:20.261 --> 01:44:29.386]  We interviewed in the last hour a dairy farmer in Missouri who had his cheese outlawed because the government contaminated it and then blamed him for it.
[01:44:30.026 --> 01:44:43.534]  But food, you know, if we get down to the issue of justice here, justice means people having the freedom to live their lives in the way they see fit as long as they don't harm others in the process.
[01:44:43.534 --> 01:44:48.598]  And justice means you gotta have freedom to have justice.
[01:44:48.598 --> 01:44:51.259]  If you don't have freedom, you can't have justice.
[01:44:51.259 --> 01:44:57.243]  So growing your own food is actually an act of resistance against the corporate controllers.
[01:45:00.293 --> 01:45:04.116]  I mean, that's absolutely right.
[01:45:04.116 --> 01:45:07.319]  You know, that's what some of the education we're doing.
[01:45:07.319 --> 01:45:08.880]  It's something empowering.
[01:45:08.880 --> 01:45:14.725]  One thing we also realize is that young people, and people in general, when you actually grow your food, you're more likely to eat it.
[01:45:14.725 --> 01:45:16.246]  That's right, yeah.
[01:45:16.246 --> 01:45:24.933]  So, growing food is very strategic, and it actually marks the check off of so many different areas that it's a must.
[01:45:24.933 --> 01:45:29.277]  And seed savings along with the heirloom seeds, I mean, these things
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:32.701]  A revolutionary, of course, you know, right now.
[01:45:32.701 --> 01:45:39.544]  You know, I mean, these things have come in place in the past, but one thing I borrowed inspiration from is the Black Panther Party.
[01:45:39.544 --> 01:45:42.005]  You know, I have Black Panthers in my family and stuff like that.
[01:45:42.005 --> 01:45:49.889]  I also borrowed a lot of inspiration from the Indigenous community, Indigenous ceremony, people who have been living close to Earth and doing this for a long time.
[01:45:49.889 --> 01:45:53.090]  But one thing the Black Panther Party did was, they had a free breakfast program.
[01:45:53.743 --> 01:45:59.044]  You know, and that's really when the government started looking at it like, wow, this is actually embarrassing.
[01:45:59.044 --> 01:46:06.066]  We had this whole going cell pro thing going and actually providing resources for the community and sickle cell clinics, etc.
[01:46:06.066 --> 01:46:09.047]  And this is the 2013 version of that.
[01:46:09.047 --> 01:46:15.889]  Really, you know, when you grow your food, you got that seed and it's not the same amount of power and that seed is the same amount of power.
[01:46:16.429 --> 01:46:16.750]  Yeah.
[01:46:16.750 --> 01:46:16.910]  Yeah.
[01:46:34.153 --> 01:46:37.516]  Well, that sounds like a really healthy daily habit there to do that.
[01:46:48.581 --> 01:47:05.909]  You know, I don't know a lot of history about the Black Panther Party itself, but what I do know is that American history is full of groups being suppressed and oppressed, including, you know, the American Indians, including right now veterans being oppressed and suppressed by the government.
[01:47:05.909 --> 01:47:12.792]  What I know is that government never wants any people to be free, and what government does is it switches from one group to another.
[01:47:13.232 --> 01:47:20.739]  So, it might have been black people in one era, and then it's southerners, and then it's veterans, and then in the future it could be Latinos, it could be anybody.
[01:47:20.739 --> 01:47:23.101]  They just change the targets, basically.
[01:47:23.101 --> 01:47:26.023]  But the system is always a system of oppression.
[01:47:26.023 --> 01:47:32.669]  So that's why I support freedom and justice in whatever form it is, from wherever it comes out of the culture.
[01:47:32.669 --> 01:47:37.694]  That's what I support, is individual freedom, and that's what I see you singing about.
[01:47:37.694 --> 01:47:39.495]  So I commend you for this song.
[01:47:39.495 --> 01:47:39.996]  It's amazing.
[01:47:41.104 --> 01:47:44.306]  Yeah, thank you for promoting it and posting it.
[01:47:44.306 --> 01:47:46.848]  Yeah, it's my pleasure to do so, and I hope we see more from you, too.
[01:47:46.848 --> 01:47:58.415]  I hope you stay on this track and put out some more music and videos that speaks to this spiritual truth and this war of resistance against the food poisoners.
[01:47:58.415 --> 01:47:59.055]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:47:59.055 --> 01:48:02.498]  I mean, go to earthamplified.com and we have songs about water.
[01:48:02.498 --> 01:48:06.020]  I mean, people talk about oil, but we might move on to water next.
[01:48:06.918 --> 01:48:08.479]  Um, and talk more about that, too.
[01:48:08.479 --> 01:48:09.159]  That's huge.
[01:48:09.159 --> 01:48:10.260]  I mean, fluoride in the water.
[01:48:10.260 --> 01:48:12.921]  Um, I mean, so much for water.
[01:48:12.921 --> 01:48:13.702]  That's right.
[01:48:13.702 --> 01:48:15.623]  It's like, wow, we have to move.
[01:48:15.623 --> 01:48:18.584]  So, you know, what are we doing with the basic, you know?
[01:48:18.584 --> 01:48:29.230]  Well, you know, one thing that's really interesting, if you take, I found that African Americans are really well informed on the dangers of vaccines and they will, they will say no to vaccines more than a typical group of white folks.
[01:48:29.230 --> 01:48:34.773]  If you, if you have a hundred white folks in a room and you have a hundred African Americans in a room and you say, who wants a vaccine?
[01:48:35.253 --> 01:48:42.437]  It's the white folks that raise their hands, me, me, me, I'll take the vaccine, and all the black folks are like, um, I might want to think twice about that.
[01:48:42.437 --> 01:48:47.720]  I find that very interesting, because they've learned to not trust the lies coming out of medicine.
[01:48:47.720 --> 01:48:50.121]  Do you see that as well?
[01:48:50.121 --> 01:49:00.967]  Yeah, I mean, we've had African American history, look at the history, I mean, it's like, you know, it's a CG experiment, you know, like, you know, illegal
[01:49:03.391 --> 01:49:08.156]  Yeah, the medical experiments man, the Tuskegee experiments, all that.
[01:49:22.478 --> 01:49:27.742]  You know, me personally, I mean, speaking on behalf of myself, you know, I haven't vaccinated my son.
[01:49:27.742 --> 01:49:28.422]  Yeah.
[01:49:28.422 --> 01:49:33.126]  You know, I'm not a study on that tip, and I've done a lot of research on it.
[01:49:33.126 --> 01:49:34.747]  Good for you.
[01:49:34.747 --> 01:49:43.033]  But, um, yeah, you know, I mean, I think, you know, when people get the information, um, they make healthier choices.
[01:49:43.033 --> 01:49:50.258]  So, education, you know, help people change people's consciousness, shift people's consciousness, and people really get into a space where they actually
[01:49:51.264 --> 01:49:56.985]  And then we deal with the spiritual aspect too, so that people can find that sovereignty within, and that doesn't emanate outward.
[01:49:56.985 --> 01:50:03.087]  So, we do an inside movement, inside outward, and outside in, as well, being aware of what's going on.
[01:50:03.087 --> 01:50:03.787]  Well, you're right.
[01:50:03.787 --> 01:50:07.828]  The transformation starts from the inside, and then it moves outside.
[01:50:07.828 --> 01:50:08.788]  You've nailed it.
[01:50:08.788 --> 01:50:09.349]  You're exactly right.
[01:50:09.349 --> 01:50:11.269]  We've only got about a minute left with you, Asha.
[01:50:11.269 --> 01:50:15.130]  Any final thoughts before we wrap this up?
[01:50:15.130 --> 01:50:17.791]  And also, I want to thank you in advance for being on the show today.
[01:50:17.791 --> 01:50:18.691]  But, final thoughts?
[01:50:20.017 --> 01:50:38.492]  Yeah, just, you know, just thinking, uh, Earth Amplified, J-Blast, um, the whole crew, the Brooklyn crew, the Oakland community, and big Osala Foo Fighters worldwide, Rondana Shiva, um, all amazing, beautiful, noble souls that we around within this time who will actually stand up for truth and light, um, may it be so, and then we go onward.
[01:50:40.293 --> 01:50:41.053]  Amen to that.
[01:50:41.053 --> 01:50:45.055]  Thank you for your contribution to this fight for food justice.
[01:50:45.055 --> 01:50:45.875]  Thank you for what you do.
[01:50:45.875 --> 01:50:48.256]  Thank you for being who you are.
[01:50:48.256 --> 01:50:53.998]  I really, really was inspired by your video and I want to encourage everybody out there to go check it out.
[01:50:53.998 --> 01:50:56.399]  Food Fight by Seasons.
[01:50:56.399 --> 01:50:57.039]  Check it out.
[01:50:57.039 --> 01:50:57.659]  Spread the word.
[01:50:57.659 --> 01:50:58.380]  It's good stuff.
[01:50:58.380 --> 01:50:59.160]  Thanks for being with us.
[01:51:01.198 --> 01:51:03.059]  Alright, your freedoms are on the line.
[01:51:03.059 --> 01:51:04.861]  The Second Amendment is in danger.
[01:51:04.861 --> 01:51:07.203]  How soon before your freedoms are taken away?
[01:51:07.203 --> 01:51:08.924]  What can you not live without?
[01:51:08.924 --> 01:51:10.645]  What is your greatest dependency?
[01:51:10.645 --> 01:51:11.626]  Is it your guns?
[01:51:11.626 --> 01:51:12.587]  Is it your home?
[01:51:12.587 --> 01:51:14.008]  No, it's food.
[01:51:14.008 --> 01:51:16.110]  It all boils down to the food supply.
[01:51:16.110 --> 01:51:19.612]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[01:51:19.612 --> 01:51:20.853]  Don't be dependent.
[01:51:20.853 --> 01:51:21.774]  Be self-sufficient.
[01:51:21.934 --> 01:51:23.595]  Don't wait for the government to feed you.
[01:51:23.595 --> 01:51:24.695]  Feed yourself.
[01:51:24.695 --> 01:51:26.936]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[01:51:26.936 --> 01:51:30.477]  Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from eFoodsDirect.
[01:51:30.477 --> 01:51:33.238]  It's the best long-term storable food on the planet.
[01:51:33.238 --> 01:51:35.578]  Get the popular Mega Patriot Pack free.
[01:51:35.578 --> 01:51:39.220]  A 24-day supply of food plus stove, cook pot, and fuel.
[01:51:39.220 --> 01:51:39.500]  Call 800-409-FOOD.
[01:51:40.640 --> 01:51:41.080]  I think so.
[01:52:00.615 --> 01:52:05.819]  We all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[01:52:05.819 --> 01:52:15.206]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over six years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey guy offers amazing specials for Berkey water filtration systems.
[01:52:15.206 --> 01:52:29.237]  The Berkey light systems include a set of self-sterilizing and recleanable black purification elements that purify water by removing chlorine, pathogenic bacteria, cysts and parasites to non-detectable levels and remove harmful chemicals such as herbicides and pesticides.

[01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:48.140]  That's 1-877-886-3653.

[01:53:00.305 --> 01:53:02.587]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[01:53:02.587 --> 01:53:03.528]  Answer this.
[01:53:03.528 --> 01:53:15.819]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $35?
[01:53:17.060 --> 01:53:19.201]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[01:53:19.201 --> 01:53:21.341]  This year, about one in every 50 U.S.
[01:53:21.341 --> 01:53:25.423]  homes will have a break-in, with burglars usually picking the easy target.
[01:53:25.423 --> 01:53:28.004]  A dark house that looks like no one is home.
[01:53:28.004 --> 01:53:36.066]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[01:53:36.066 --> 01:53:39.007]  It's like a lamp on a timer, but far more convincing.
[01:53:39.007 --> 01:53:39.488]  And for only $34.95,
[01:53:40.788 --> 01:53:46.089]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[01:53:46.089 --> 01:53:48.770]  Go to Faketv.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.
[01:53:48.770 --> 01:53:50.291]  That's 877-532-5388 or go to Faketv.com.
[01:53:50.291 --> 01:53:51.871]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:54:13.394 --> 01:54:19.139]  Yeah, we're back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:19.139 --> 01:54:20.100]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:54:20.100 --> 01:54:25.845]  This is Mike Adams, Health Ranger, filling in today.
[01:54:25.845 --> 01:54:32.712]  Yeah, and this is my final segment today because the next hour we feature an interview with Immortal Technique.
[01:54:32.712 --> 01:54:38.257]  That's Alex Jones and Immortal Technique coming up in just a few minutes, so you don't want to miss that.
[01:54:38.817 --> 01:54:47.566]  It's interesting, we're talking to a lot of musical artists because they have such passion for justice and for truth, you know, across the board.
[01:54:47.566 --> 01:54:49.468]  I think it's great.
[01:54:49.468 --> 01:54:50.088]  And by the way, you know...
[01:54:51.052 --> 01:54:55.773]  You might ask, well, how come I'm not covering all of the police state news?
[01:54:55.773 --> 01:55:01.815]  I am going to cover more news here, but the bottom line is Alex gets that topic nailed.
[01:55:01.815 --> 01:55:18.219]  My job is to come in here and cover a little bit of different things of what's going on out there from the world of health, from the world of food and GMOs, and just to bring in some different angles of what I'm seeing out there, because I don't come in here and try to be
[01:55:19.079 --> 01:55:27.404]  Alex, you know, I come in here with my own take on what's happening and, you know, from my experience as the Health Ranger and so on.
[01:55:27.404 --> 01:55:30.785]  And by the way, along those lines, check out InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:55:30.785 --> 01:55:34.487]  We've got the Health Ranger lineup right there in the store today for the first time.
[01:55:34.487 --> 01:55:40.711]  This is the Milestone Day and we're going to be supplying InfoWars Store with all the Health Ranger Select products from here forward.
[01:55:40.711 --> 01:55:44.213]  So you can support InfoWars and stay healthy with the cleanest food.
[01:55:44.833 --> 01:55:52.196]  So clean, superfoods, turmeric supplements, the only stuff that I'm willing to put my name on, that's what we produce.
[01:55:52.196 --> 01:55:53.917]  This is actually produced right here in Texas.
[01:55:53.917 --> 01:55:58.619]  I don't mean it's grown in Texas, I mean it's packaged in a certified organic facility that we put together out here.
[01:55:59.648 --> 01:56:08.274]  Also, the InfoWars Magazine, the next issue is now out, the newest issue, Civil War II, on the cover, and it's got an American flag on the cover.
[01:56:08.274 --> 01:56:11.476]  Check out the magazine, get yourself a subscription.
[01:56:11.476 --> 01:56:17.361]  This thing is loaded with great information, the layout is amazing, the artists who are involved with this.
[01:56:18.181 --> 01:56:19.761]  The Layout Artist.
[01:56:19.761 --> 01:56:21.362]  This is a blast to read.
[01:56:21.362 --> 01:56:22.602]  And it's super educational.
[01:56:22.602 --> 01:56:24.203]  It's got some great sponsors.
[01:56:24.203 --> 01:56:25.643]  So check out that magazine.
[01:56:25.643 --> 01:56:29.444]  Subscribe at InfoWarsStore.com.
[01:56:29.444 --> 01:56:31.644]  I'm going to take one home with me, actually.
[01:56:31.644 --> 01:56:33.165]  Got it hot off the presses here, man.
[01:56:33.165 --> 01:56:41.247]  That's one of the little fringe benefits of filling in for Alex, is I get my hands on these magazines faster than most other people.
[01:56:41.807 --> 01:56:42.607]  So that's fun.
[01:56:42.607 --> 01:56:44.448]  Here's some other news that's breaking right now.
[01:56:44.448 --> 01:56:47.309]  Paul Joseph Watson's story up at InfoWars.com.
[01:56:47.309 --> 01:56:50.750]  DHS censors information about firearms purchases.
[01:56:50.750 --> 01:56:59.193]  You know how we reported that DHS was purchasing 7,000 full-auto assault rifles for their Immigration and Customs Enforcement project?
[01:57:00.243 --> 01:57:01.564]  Right, give me a break.
[01:57:01.564 --> 01:57:05.148]  They need 7,000 assault rifles to deal with immigrants?
[01:57:05.148 --> 01:57:06.209]  Really?
[01:57:06.209 --> 01:57:20.922]  Anyway, they've started blacking out the numbers of rifles that they're purchasing now because I guess they got tired of Paul Joseph Watson monitoring their bids and finding out that they're purchasing 2 billion rounds of ammo and 7,000 assault rifles and so on.
[01:57:20.922 --> 01:57:22.704]  So they're blacking out the numbers.
[01:57:22.704 --> 01:57:23.264]  Next item.
[01:57:24.245 --> 01:57:25.506]  Gun registration.
[01:57:25.506 --> 01:57:27.247]  Criminals are exempt.
[01:57:27.247 --> 01:57:33.411]  This is an article from James Wesley Rawls.
[01:57:33.411 --> 01:57:42.696]  Man, that's what happens when I shoot 50 cows next to Alex and Shane.
[01:57:42.696 --> 01:57:46.299]  I get a little head concussion and then I screw things up.
[01:57:46.299 --> 01:57:48.400]  It's from survivalblog.com.
[01:57:48.400 --> 01:57:49.781]  James Wesley Rawls.
[01:57:50.621 --> 01:57:52.382]  One absurdity of gun registration.
[01:57:52.382 --> 01:57:54.462]  Criminals are exempt.
[01:57:54.462 --> 01:57:55.462]  And it's true.
[01:57:55.462 --> 01:57:59.384]  Supreme Court decision says that criminals do not have to comply.
[01:57:59.384 --> 01:58:08.426]  In fact, are forbidden from complying with gun registration laws because of the Fifth Amendment and the protection against self-incrimination.
[01:58:08.426 --> 01:58:12.908]  So the best way to not have to register your firearms is to become a criminal.
[01:58:12.908 --> 01:58:15.568]  According to the Supreme Court.
[01:58:15.568 --> 01:58:16.669]  How crazy does it get?
[01:58:17.589 --> 01:58:33.682]  Alright, well folks, that's about it for me today, but Alex Jones coming up next with Immortal Technique, an hour-long special interview broadcasting next, and I'll be hosting InfoWars Nightly News tonight with some breaking news, and Jim Mars is our guest, so don't miss that.
[01:58:33.682 --> 01:58:38.866]  Thank you for joining us today, it's been a pleasure being here, and I'll be on next week with more news.
[01:58:38.866 --> 01:58:39.247]  Take care.
[01:58:39.247 --> 01:58:42.970]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:45.046 --> 01:58:51.191]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.191 --> 01:58:52.752]  Your freedoms are on the line.
[01:58:52.752 --> 01:58:54.554]  The Second Amendment is in danger.
[01:58:54.554 --> 01:58:56.895]  How soon before your freedoms are taken away?
[01:58:56.895 --> 01:58:58.617]  What can you not live without?
[01:58:58.617 --> 01:59:00.318]  What is your greatest dependency?
[01:59:00.318 --> 01:59:01.319]  Is it your guns?
[01:59:01.319 --> 01:59:02.260]  Is it your home?
[01:59:02.260 --> 01:59:03.701]  No, it's food.
[01:59:03.701 --> 01:59:05.802]  It all boils down to the food supply.
[01:59:05.802 --> 01:59:09.305]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[01:59:09.305 --> 01:59:10.546]  Don't be dependent.
[01:59:10.546 --> 01:59:11.647]  Be self-sufficient.
[01:59:11.647 --> 01:59:13.288]  Don't wait for the government to feed you.
[01:59:13.288 --> 01:59:13.949]  Feed yourself.
[01:59:14.389 --> 01:59:16.609]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

[02:00:00.669 --> 02:00:05.575]  The purpose of life is a life with a purpose, so I'd rather die for a cause than live a life that is worthless.
[02:00:05.575 --> 02:00:07.878]  Big brother, mainstream media.
[02:00:07.878 --> 02:00:11.423]  People can't hear me because I say it through hip hop.
[02:00:11.423 --> 02:00:15.188]  And no matter what the venue is, they'll still think hip hop...
[02:00:16.369 --> 02:00:18.790]  Irresponsible, arrogant young people.
[02:00:18.790 --> 02:00:29.036]  Or they'll hear you say something, and they'll say, oh man, I love this guy, but he went crazy on Piers, and I don't think that he should represent the movement that way.
[02:00:29.036 --> 02:00:42.983]  At some point, you and I will only touch a fraction of the people that we need to speak to, and yet I think that what's important about it is to have so many diverse groups of individuals who have the same core message.
[02:00:43.763 --> 02:00:45.204]  What's behind the mask?
[02:01:03.497 --> 02:01:10.923]  His new CD, very powerful music, and a new film he's got coming out with some pretty big, heavy headers.
[02:01:10.923 --> 02:01:12.764]  And so, but he goes by Tech.
[02:01:12.764 --> 02:01:18.689]  Immortal Technique is here in studio with us with the beautiful Barrett 50 Cal.
[02:01:18.689 --> 02:01:20.770]  Let's start with, I said, what do you want to cover first?
[02:01:20.770 --> 02:01:21.731]  You said guns.
[02:01:21.731 --> 02:01:24.353]  So I said, hey, grab the 50 Cal out of the safe.
[02:01:24.353 --> 02:01:26.354]  So that's why the 50 Cal is here on the table.
[02:01:26.354 --> 02:01:28.616]  Specifically, Second Amendment.
[02:01:28.616 --> 02:01:29.557]  Tell me where you stand on that.
[02:01:30.157 --> 02:01:32.200]  You're never going to ban guns in this country.
[02:01:32.200 --> 02:01:32.721]  You know what I mean?
[02:01:32.721 --> 02:01:36.125]  I mean, you can read the Dick Act of 1902.
[02:01:36.125 --> 02:01:40.371]  We're talking about it being against the Constitution for them to do that.
[02:01:40.371 --> 02:01:44.797]  Did people misuse this as a tool?
[02:01:44.797 --> 02:01:45.017]  Yes.
[02:01:45.618 --> 02:01:48.700]  You know, did someone try to blow themselves up on a plane?
[02:01:48.700 --> 02:01:49.921]  Yes.
[02:01:49.921 --> 02:01:59.548]  Whether it was a shoe bomber or a guy with a grenade strapped to his underwear, we all have to go through screening now because of that.
[02:01:59.548 --> 02:02:08.355]  And do I agree with people being screened and having to take like mental, have some sort of mental capacity to own a weapon like this?
[02:02:08.355 --> 02:02:09.656]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:02:09.656 --> 02:02:12.278]  However, I always tell people that
[02:02:13.018 --> 02:02:22.426]  Before we get into an alarmist position, if the government wants to attack you, for example, people in New York, I tell them, they don't have to take away your guns.
[02:02:22.426 --> 02:02:24.468]  They can just turn the water off.
[02:02:24.468 --> 02:02:27.530]  Can the average person in New York drink out of the Hudson?
[02:02:27.530 --> 02:02:29.892]  Can they drink out of the East River?
[02:02:29.892 --> 02:02:30.593]  No!
[02:02:30.593 --> 02:02:32.915]  They control every other resource about your life.
[02:02:32.995 --> 02:02:34.356]  That's why they want you so dependent.
[02:02:34.356 --> 02:02:39.460]  Guns are kind of the vestigial sign of one of the last freedoms we've got, and I could go to the issues of... No, no, no.
[02:02:39.460 --> 02:02:46.145]  Also, my, uh, not to interrupt you, my big shout-out to my friend Dave Gomez, Chief Warrant Officer.
[02:02:46.145 --> 02:02:58.474]  We had this conversation, and I said, you know, what good would, you know, light arms like an AR-15 be against a division of heavily armored troops that came in?
[02:02:58.474 --> 02:03:01.596]  Like, in other words, what good would your peashooters be?
[02:03:01.596 --> 02:03:02.217]  And he said to me,
[02:03:03.283 --> 02:03:06.165]  It's working really well for those people in Afghanistan.
[02:03:06.165 --> 02:03:08.166]  They don't have advanced weaponry.
[02:03:08.166 --> 02:03:09.867]  It's the willingness to die.
[02:03:09.867 --> 02:03:11.048]  It's the willingness to resist.
[02:03:11.048 --> 02:03:15.111]  Look how frightened they were of a guy like Chris Storner.
[02:03:15.111 --> 02:03:21.555]  One man, regardless of whether you or I think that story is true or the public does, one man.
[02:03:21.555 --> 02:03:24.797]  He wasn't armed with bazookas and tanks.
[02:03:24.797 --> 02:03:31.782]  The police were so scared, they shot up multiple innocent people, were hyperventilating in fear, and then said, we're gonna burn it down.
[02:03:31.782 --> 02:03:32.483]  Burned it down.
[02:03:33.403 --> 02:03:33.684]  Right.
[02:03:33.684 --> 02:03:35.466]  And then told us you didn't hear that.
[02:03:35.466 --> 02:03:45.279]  And anyone that would dare to question whether the government was corrupt or not, or whether his position was right, is automatically painted as if they support murder.
[02:03:45.279 --> 02:03:45.760]  Right?
[02:03:45.760 --> 02:03:47.242]  The reality is this.
[02:03:47.242 --> 02:03:50.146]  When you kill someone without due process,
[02:03:50.766 --> 02:03:51.527]  That's murder.
[02:03:51.527 --> 02:03:54.671]  The cops basically went in there and murdered him.
[02:03:54.671 --> 02:03:56.212]  Did he murder people?
[02:03:56.212 --> 02:03:57.113]  Absolutely.
[02:03:57.113 --> 02:03:58.455]  Was he wrong for that?
[02:03:58.455 --> 02:03:59.196]  Yes.
[02:03:59.196 --> 02:04:00.938]  Did they want him alive?
[02:04:00.938 --> 02:04:01.639]  No.
[02:04:01.639 --> 02:04:06.424]  Because if they got him alive and he stood trial, I think it would have been the end of it.
[02:04:06.724 --> 02:04:09.685]  I think that people would have been like, are you kidding me?
[02:04:09.685 --> 02:04:14.447]  Is this guy about to blow the lid on how fascist this system has become?
[02:04:14.447 --> 02:04:16.807]  On how people have been trained to think this way?
[02:04:16.807 --> 02:04:22.049]  And I know we always talk about Nazi Germany, but the Germans were not animals, Alex.
[02:04:22.049 --> 02:04:23.610]  They were human beings.
[02:04:23.610 --> 02:04:25.010]  They were conditioned.
[02:04:25.010 --> 02:04:29.792]  You know, when you read the stories of the SS officers that were given a puppy, you know what I mean?
[02:04:29.792 --> 02:04:32.353]  To have during their time in the academy.
[02:04:32.353 --> 02:04:33.213]  And they had to kill it.
[02:04:33.213 --> 02:04:35.914]  And the last order is, shoot the puppy in the head.
[02:04:36.634 --> 02:04:45.081]  Unflinching, absolute loyalty, unquestioning to what they think is the republic, to what they think is what is supposed to be the nation.
[02:04:45.081 --> 02:04:48.644]  And it was done by increments, just like we've become so evil by increment.
[02:04:48.644 --> 02:04:50.326]  A little bit more, a little bit more.
[02:04:50.326 --> 02:04:52.608]  Rationalize, get into it, and pretty soon...
[02:05:01.024 --> 02:05:04.426]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[02:05:04.426 --> 02:05:10.468]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[02:05:10.468 --> 02:05:14.350]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[02:08:28.520 --> 02:08:42.271]  You know, it's interesting to be on this program because a lot of people will approach me and they'll be like, I can't believe you're gonna do this show and I think that there are a lot of perceptions about yourself that, um, that people have the wrong idea about.
[02:08:42.271 --> 02:08:48.817]  When people say to me, oh, Alex Jones, you mean the guy who talks like the micromachine man and puts all these dates and stuff into it?
[02:08:48.817 --> 02:08:52.620]  I say, listen, if you slow down what he's saying and you look
[02:08:53.320 --> 02:09:00.863]  Literally one sentence by one sentence, you have 200 things to research within the span of that.
[02:09:00.863 --> 02:09:05.905]  And I think that sometimes what would benefit you is to slow it down and say, hey man, you know what?
[02:09:05.905 --> 02:09:07.486]  Today we're just going to deal with this.
[02:09:07.486 --> 02:09:07.966]  No, I agree.
[02:09:07.966 --> 02:09:08.787]  But here's the problem.
[02:09:08.787 --> 02:09:11.788]  The way my brain works, I think most people's actually work this way.
[02:09:12.568 --> 02:09:16.691]  I love when people start like that, the problem is the way my brain works.
[02:09:16.691 --> 02:09:22.774]  There's like a hundred different, in fact what people think I'm talking fast, that's like one one-hundredth.
[02:09:22.774 --> 02:09:32.980]  Because when I see something I know all the connections and how it integrates because I've read all the establishment publications and then I know the three, they're thinking like a three level chess, the general public's playing checkers.
[02:09:33.980 --> 02:09:38.666]  And they want to keep us in a checkers level, and that's what's so frustrating, is that I can see their endgame.
[02:09:38.666 --> 02:09:46.175]  You know, you're not one of these guys who came out and said the whole fascism started with the black guy crowd.
[02:09:46.175 --> 02:09:46.696]  You know what I mean?
[02:09:46.696 --> 02:09:53.063]  I remember you from the Bush administration days being out there saying, do you realize what's happening here in America?
[02:09:53.063 --> 02:09:53.304]  You know?
[02:09:53.664 --> 02:09:57.766]  You are looking at it through a right-left paradigm, is what you were saying to people.
[02:09:57.766 --> 02:10:00.707]  When in reality, it doesn't matter who's going to be there.
[02:10:00.707 --> 02:10:05.128]  Whoever comes after Bush is going to have to cross the T's and dot the I's.
[02:10:05.128 --> 02:10:06.749]  Well, no, that's it.
[02:10:06.749 --> 02:10:08.489]  Cynthia McKinney was on my show about a month ago.
[02:10:08.489 --> 02:10:13.131]  She's back on next week, the former Congresswoman, for those that I'm sure most viewers know who she is.
[02:10:13.131 --> 02:10:16.632]  And she said, look, it's not that Barack Obama's the lesser of two evils.
[02:10:16.632 --> 02:10:17.813]  He's the more effective.
[02:10:18.833 --> 02:10:23.974]  Mitt Romney would have done the exact same thing, but couldn't have gotten away with as much.
[02:10:23.974 --> 02:10:47.320]  And I think that, look, if someone else had been able to be in that position, smiling, and then sending all of these troops and mercenaries back into Iraq, back into Afghanistan, exploiting the natural resources, deporting as many people as he did, which we'll get into later, I think that that would have garnered a lot more hatred if it had happened from a right-wing Republican white guy, as opposed to
[02:10:47.780 --> 02:10:56.906]  Someone who has the impression of being an incredibly liberal individual, and yet follows, you know, a secretive agenda that really doesn't answer to anybody.
[02:10:56.906 --> 02:10:58.847]  All I can say is I'm a true independent.
[02:10:58.847 --> 02:11:01.669]  I tweeted earlier today and said, you know, two real independents.
[02:11:01.669 --> 02:11:02.530]  You're a real independent.
[02:11:02.530 --> 02:11:03.810]  You're not controlled.
[02:11:03.810 --> 02:11:10.635]  I mean, I think I first met you seven, eight years ago in New York, and I've had a chance to be at a few of your events, and you've been there at a showing of Endgame.
[02:11:11.135 --> 02:11:15.016]  And I just respect the fact that I agree with about 85% of what you stand for.
[02:11:15.016 --> 02:11:18.957]  And I probably agree with the other 15 if I fully understood it or had time to follow it all.
[02:11:18.957 --> 02:11:21.178]  But most of what I've heard you talk about I agree with.
[02:11:21.178 --> 02:11:26.039]  But you're through a different prism, a different perspective, a different scanner darkly.
[02:11:26.039 --> 02:11:27.640]  Myself as well.
[02:11:27.640 --> 02:11:29.040]  My only issue is this.
[02:11:29.040 --> 02:11:39.223]  Whatever the globalists are really pushing, it may have a bunch of good reasons and a cover story associated with it of why it sounds good.
[02:11:39.223 --> 02:11:40.343]  But I look at what
[02:11:40.603 --> 02:11:44.446]  Their internal documents, leaked documents, what the larger endgame is.
[02:11:44.446 --> 02:11:44.926]  Absolutely.
[02:11:44.926 --> 02:11:49.149]  And so I'm like, we can't have open borders because the Globals want a North American Union.
[02:11:49.149 --> 02:11:58.056]  They want to implode Mexico under 1021, force everybody off their land into Maquiladoras, then up here to drive down wages, then to create a culture clash.
[02:11:58.056 --> 02:12:01.679]  See, if the system was trying to unify things for everybody to be friends, it'd be different.
[02:12:01.679 --> 02:12:06.442]  In the name of, quote, liberalism, they then sell it as a, but I mean, it would take an hour to break
[02:12:06.442 --> 02:12:08.003]  Well, we'll get into that.
[02:12:08.003 --> 02:12:16.245]  I think the reality is that people often misunderstand and misrepresent the mythology of America.
[02:12:16.245 --> 02:12:25.689]  For example, the creation of the United States and the fact that when Britain surrendered, it ceded a series of territories that didn't belong to them.
[02:12:25.689 --> 02:12:29.530]  When Mexico surrendered to the United States after the Mexican-American War,
[02:12:29.930 --> 02:12:33.092]  It's ceded a series of territories that did not belong to them.
[02:12:33.092 --> 02:12:37.595]  You know, all of these Native American tribes, they weren't ruled solely by Spain.
[02:12:37.595 --> 02:12:40.336]  As a matter of fact, Spain couldn't exercise control over them.
[02:12:40.336 --> 02:12:42.457]  The Mexican government couldn't exercise control.
[02:12:42.457 --> 02:12:43.238]  No, I agree!
[02:12:43.238 --> 02:12:49.502]  And then the other part of it becomes from when I hear people talk about who deserves to be here and who doesn't.
[02:12:49.502 --> 02:12:53.904]  Because I've met people who don't have papers legally, right?
[02:12:53.904 --> 02:12:56.886]  And yet they serve their country in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:12:56.966 --> 02:13:02.189]  Now, mind you, that's not a war that I necessarily believe in, but when I hear a bunch of... But it's hypocrisy!
[02:13:02.189 --> 02:13:14.055]  When I hear a bunch of chicken hawks saying, oh, you're not down with America, and I look at them and I say, hey, what did you ever do to be considered American besides fall out of some wretched hole in Kansas or New York or Texas?
[02:13:14.055 --> 02:13:21.259]  You know, here's a guy who barely speaks the language, and yet he's putting his life on the line for the perceived safety of the United States.
[02:13:21.259 --> 02:13:24.541]  Now, regardless of whether you or I agree with the premise of the war...
[02:13:24.701 --> 02:13:25.902]  He's paid dues.
[02:13:25.902 --> 02:13:26.502]  Behind it, right.
[02:13:26.502 --> 02:13:27.422]  He's paid his dues.
[02:13:27.422 --> 02:13:28.143]  No, I get that.
[02:13:28.143 --> 02:13:44.271]  The people, if you're drinking orange juice out there, if you're wearing clothes that are made of cotton as opposed to hemp because they had to outlaw that, if you're eating strawberries in the winter, blueberries in the winter, that doesn't grow in the winter.
[02:13:44.271 --> 02:13:47.513]  It had to come from plantation-like atmospheres.
[02:13:47.513 --> 02:13:50.495]  You know, we've overthrown governments overseas just to
[02:13:51.015 --> 02:13:51.655]  I agree.
[02:13:51.655 --> 02:13:52.256]  Globalism.
[02:13:52.256 --> 02:13:53.657]  Neocolonialism.
[02:13:53.657 --> 02:13:56.139]  And it's tied into neoliberalism as well.
[02:13:56.139 --> 02:13:58.240]  The idea that everything's for sale.
[02:13:58.240 --> 02:13:59.701]  That the air's for sale.
[02:13:59.701 --> 02:14:01.142]  That the water's for sale.
[02:14:01.142 --> 02:14:05.285]  You know, these people want to privatize every aspect of human life.
[02:14:05.285 --> 02:14:11.069]  Whatever the establishment wants, you can bet it's not good for the general public.
[02:14:11.069 --> 02:14:12.510]  I don't care what color you are.
[02:14:12.510 --> 02:14:13.351]  I mean, here's an example.
[02:14:13.991 --> 02:14:21.237]  I like the immigrants that I know from Mexico, and they tend to be better family people, not decadent, spoiled brat Americans.
[02:14:21.237 --> 02:14:23.318]  I don't care what color the spoiled brat American is.
[02:14:23.318 --> 02:14:25.219]  We've had it good so long, they're spoiled brats.
[02:14:25.219 --> 02:14:29.483]  And that's an over-stereotype, but there's some reality to it, where there's smoke, there's fire.
[02:14:29.483 --> 02:14:35.307]  But, then the Mexican government, if I go down there, will shake me down, beat me up, steal my car.
[02:14:35.307 --> 02:14:37.829]  I can't move down there and go have a baby paid for at the hospital.
[02:14:38.209 --> 02:14:39.649]  I can't get all this stuff free.
[02:14:39.649 --> 02:14:49.292]  And then I'm criticized up here by Mexico for how bad I am when Mexico has the most draconian anti-immigrant laws in all of Latin America.
[02:14:49.292 --> 02:14:52.613]  I'm just sick of always hearing inherently that America's bad.
[02:14:52.613 --> 02:15:01.236]  What's bad is this imperial global corporate British model that corporations have adopted that is now open source for these elites.
[02:15:01.636 --> 02:15:01.936]  Right.
[02:15:01.936 --> 02:15:15.467]  I think, though, that what needs to happen in that conversation, because, you know, I love to read the criticisms of myself, not only because I find them funny and they're not true, but also because it gives me a chance to debunk these things.
[02:15:15.467 --> 02:15:15.627]  Me, too.
[02:15:15.627 --> 02:15:16.247]  It's entertaining.
[02:15:16.247 --> 02:15:22.793]  When people say to me, oh, Alex Jones, you mean the guy who talks like the micromachine man and puts all these dates and stuff into it?
[02:15:22.793 --> 02:15:26.596]  I say, listen, if you slow down what he's saying and you look
[02:15:27.316 --> 02:15:34.860]  Literally one sentence by one sentence, you have 200 things to research within the span of that.
[02:15:34.860 --> 02:15:39.903]  And I think that sometimes what would benefit you is to slow it down and say, hey man, you know what?
[02:15:39.903 --> 02:15:41.484]  Today we're just going to deal with this.
[02:15:41.484 --> 02:15:41.985]  No, I agree.
[02:15:41.985 --> 02:15:42.785]  But here's the problem.
[02:15:42.785 --> 02:15:45.767]  The way my brain works, I think most people's actually work this way.
[02:15:46.567 --> 02:15:50.669]  I love when people start like that, the problem is the way my brain works.
[02:15:50.669 --> 02:15:56.751]  There's like a hundred different, in fact what people think I'm talking fast, that's like one one-hundredth.
[02:15:56.751 --> 02:16:06.955]  Because when I see something I know all the connections and how it integrates because I've read all the establishment publications and then I know the three, they're thinking like a three level chess, the general public's playing checkers.
[02:16:07.455 --> 02:16:08.115]  Sure.
[02:16:08.115 --> 02:16:08.215]  Sure.
[02:16:29.545 --> 02:16:36.736]  So that's why the 50 Cal is here on the table, because on your shirt is the AK-47, a mortal technique, since 1492.
[02:16:36.736 --> 02:16:37.677]  I get it.
[02:16:37.677 --> 02:16:43.567]  We the indigenous peoples are seizing, you know, our right to self-determination and to be armed.
[02:16:43.567 --> 02:16:44.428]  Let's just touch on that.
[02:16:45.369 --> 02:16:53.031]  I always tell people when they come to me, they say, oh, you know, revolution, you have a lot of revolutionary figures from Latin America that are from the left wing.
[02:16:53.031 --> 02:16:57.532]  I explain to people, our revolution doesn't come with socialism or communism.
[02:16:57.532 --> 02:17:00.552]  That's an adverse effect of America's pressure.
[02:17:00.552 --> 02:17:14.535]  Originally, we heard the great prognosticator of democracy come down to Latin America at a time when we had a series of horrible imperialist military dictatorships that governments now are trying to resemble, you know, where
[02:17:15.035 --> 02:17:20.618]  You know, if you were convicted of raping a woman as a military officer, you could get out of it by agreeing to marry her.
[02:17:20.618 --> 02:17:25.460]  The most insane type of laws you could possibly imagine that governed a government.
[02:17:25.460 --> 02:17:32.884]  But when we look at that, when people were saying, you can have a democracy and you can vote for your own leaders, we thought, that's wonderful!
[02:17:32.884 --> 02:17:34.184]  What a great idea!
[02:17:34.184 --> 02:17:43.248]  And then, the great proselytizer of democracy, we realized, was the same one backing up Stroessner, Batista, you know,
[02:17:44.529 --> 02:17:45.090]  That's right.
[02:18:02.322 --> 02:18:14.153]  What we have to explain to individuals is we didn't need a European man to come from the 19th century and explain to us dark people in Latin America the complex concept.
[02:18:14.153 --> 02:18:16.255]  Plus anybody from Europe or the U.S.
[02:18:17.236 --> 02:18:25.698]  Well, no matter what color they are, if they've got globalist backing, they're coming with the corporate jackals, they're coming with the economic hitmen, and so that's the issue.
[02:18:25.698 --> 02:18:39.002]  But then you find out that the megabanks, and this isn't a conspiracy, this is on record, funded the communist movement, knowing Europe was revolting against the robber barons and the royalty, so they created a new, fake grassroots movement that they could control.
[02:18:39.002 --> 02:18:42.223]  So it's the same thing with the Soviets going in there, absolutely.
[02:18:42.603 --> 02:18:48.407]  It's like running from Bush to Obama, and then running from Obama to Mitt Romney.
[02:18:48.407 --> 02:18:49.728]  They're all part of the same thing.
[02:18:49.728 --> 02:18:54.571]  So what do you say for America, and Latin America, and the world?
[02:18:54.571 --> 02:19:05.858]  What is at your core, a moral technique, tech, what is at the core of your belief, studying this so long, being an articulate, smart guy who's been around the world, from your historical research then, what system do you like?
[02:19:05.858 --> 02:19:10.921]  Because, look, you've got Peter Thiel, the big Bilderberg guy, trying to take over the libertarian movement right now.
[02:19:11.161 --> 02:19:11.881]  I am the one who's sick!
[02:19:41.636 --> 02:19:45.357]  Politicians in my pocket for a few hundred G's.
[02:19:45.357 --> 02:19:49.738]  So if I'm never in court, my assets are never free.
[02:19:49.738 --> 02:19:51.579]  I got a job and a house and a bank account.
[02:19:51.579 --> 02:19:53.519]  When I'm out, I doubt that's something you can say.
[02:19:53.519 --> 02:19:55.480]  And if not, then a fake death like Kenneth Leigh.
[02:19:55.480 --> 02:19:57.601]  Make money every day, the world burns on its axis.
[02:19:57.601 --> 02:19:59.061]  Why y'all struggling to pay taxes?
[02:20:03.234 --> 02:20:11.341]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal Ben Soap Company.

[02:22:39.173 --> 02:22:39.954]  This capitalism?
[02:22:39.954 --> 02:22:46.238]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[02:22:46.238 --> 02:22:47.039]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[02:22:47.039 --> 02:22:50.181]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[02:23:52.330 --> 02:23:53.432]  Emergency relief.
[02:23:53.432 --> 02:23:56.218]  Longlifefood.com since 1983.
[02:23:56.218 --> 02:23:58.141]  Sending real food to your real future.
[02:24:04.972 --> 02:24:10.901]  The people who run this society, they present themselves as moral leaders.
[02:24:10.901 --> 02:24:15.307]  When you see somebody selling their body for money in the street, it's obvious.
[02:24:15.307 --> 02:24:17.510]  They're showcasing themselves.
[02:24:17.510 --> 02:24:20.895]  The prostitution is a visible... It's flaunted!
[02:24:21.576 --> 02:24:26.038]  When someone sells their soul for money, how obvious is that?
[02:24:26.038 --> 02:24:30.121]  Because it happens every single day, as much as people who sell their bodies.
[02:24:30.121 --> 02:24:33.422]  And that's why... And they do more harm to American citizens.
[02:24:33.422 --> 02:24:35.844]  And they do more harm to human beings than anybody else.
[02:24:35.844 --> 02:24:39.606]  And that's why they want to make everybody poor, is so we'll sell out to them.
[02:24:39.606 --> 02:24:39.806]  Right.
[02:24:39.946 --> 02:24:41.227]  They don't want us being independent.
[02:24:41.227 --> 02:24:42.788]  Amazing information.
[02:24:42.788 --> 02:24:46.290]  I wanted to get... I mean, behind the scenes, though, you said they'll never get rid of the guns.
[02:24:46.290 --> 02:24:47.630]  You said that on air.
[02:24:47.630 --> 02:24:50.432]  But, I mean, bottom line, you also talked about drones.
[02:24:50.432 --> 02:24:54.714]  My point is, this gun's been used in one crime to rob an armored car.
[02:24:54.714 --> 02:24:57.456]  Not this gun, but one back in the 80s.
[02:24:57.456 --> 02:24:59.117]  The Barrett .50 Cal.
[02:24:59.117 --> 02:24:59.697]  Okay?
[02:24:59.697 --> 02:25:02.178]  Why would you need a Barrett in case you send drones to my house?
[02:25:02.178 --> 02:25:03.039]  Yeah, that was the point you made.
[02:25:03.039 --> 02:25:03.979]  I wanted you to repeat.
[02:25:03.979 --> 02:25:05.360]  But it's larger than that.
[02:25:05.360 --> 02:25:06.001]  You could also...
[02:25:07.182 --> 02:25:09.864]  You know, do all sorts of things just with a can of gasoline.
[02:25:09.864 --> 02:25:13.866]  The issue is it isn't about the can of gasoline, or the truck, or the gun.
[02:25:13.866 --> 02:25:18.309]  It is about the mindset, and more of these guns out there makes it a freer society.
[02:25:37.562 --> 02:25:37.742]  Yes.
[02:25:57.917 --> 02:25:59.179]  No, we have a history of piracy.
[02:26:16.778 --> 02:26:21.700]  And I think, thank you for pointing that out, because this is the point that I'm trying to make.
[02:26:21.700 --> 02:26:28.803]  We won't have that critical discussion about how violent our government is and how violent our society is.
[02:26:28.803 --> 02:26:32.384]  Blaming it on this is the easiest way out.
[02:26:32.384 --> 02:26:38.146]  It prevents you from looking inward and saying, what have I become complicit to in America?
[02:26:38.146 --> 02:26:41.828]  Well let me say this, because what you say is absolutely on target, but here's the paradox.
[02:26:42.668 --> 02:27:09.066]  The United States was the giant, one of the last true freebooting, pirating, piratical, absolute all bets are off craziness, where you had all the different native tribes trying to get this tribe to fight with that tribe, and the French, and the Spanish, and the British, and the militias, and really it was a free-for-all, and if you really look at a lot of the groups using the same tactics,
[02:27:10.285 --> 02:27:20.634]  But the issue is, is that it was in that age, it was in that time, and if you look at that, there was a lot of murder and death, but it produced incredible wealth.
[02:27:20.634 --> 02:27:22.015]  Look at Europe, though.
[02:27:22.015 --> 02:27:28.540]  Even more people actually killed by governments and killed by the church and killed by other things, but it was the stagnation.
[02:27:28.540 --> 02:27:32.283]  So I'm not saying any of the evil in our history is a good thing or writing it off.
[02:27:32.283 --> 02:27:32.883]  I'm saying
[02:27:33.644 --> 02:27:42.486]  The quieter evil has gone on in China and in Japan, where if a samurai wanted to test out a sword, he would just chop up a few of his servants.
[02:27:42.486 --> 02:27:43.847]  And that was seen as okay.
[02:27:43.847 --> 02:27:45.487]  And I'm not attacking the Japanese either.
[02:27:45.487 --> 02:27:56.550]  My point is, is that the history has been skewed and twisted, not to demonize America, not to defend America, but to really not show people what really went on.
[02:27:56.550 --> 02:27:59.271]  And I don't even know what the point is, other than
[02:28:00.411 --> 02:28:03.153]  That why did because there's other empires?
[02:28:03.153 --> 02:28:06.375]  Why did 5% of the world population end up getting half the wealth now?
[02:28:06.375 --> 02:28:22.025]  That's all ending And I think it was because there was that absolute out-of-control Behavior going on where the central powers weren't in control it allowed more creativity and people to do what they wanted Separating that from all the killing and violence right I think
[02:28:23.085 --> 02:28:28.409]  One thing that people need to realize is empires don't fall apart because they lose wars.
[02:28:28.409 --> 02:28:30.690]  We haven't won a war since World War II.
[02:28:30.690 --> 02:28:32.532]  You know, we didn't win in Vietnam.
[02:28:32.532 --> 02:28:48.162]  I know Korean War veterans that schooled me to the game, and even though I'm not a huge fan of war, I always thank people for their service, because at least they had the courage to go, excuse my language, rather than the people who got 1,200 deferments and have no problem sending young...
[02:28:48.302 --> 02:28:50.242]  You can respect the individual for what they went through.
[02:28:50.242 --> 02:28:56.023]  But I think the point is that, you know, empires begin to die when people no longer believe in them.
[02:28:56.023 --> 02:29:07.265]  I mean, the partial collapse of the Soviet Union was due to the massive amount of cynicism that existed because the government was no longer believable outside of Moscow.
[02:29:07.265 --> 02:29:14.906]  In other words, the people that were living in this Sidhartha-like enclosement were like, oh yeah, this is, you know, the free Soviet Union.
[02:29:14.906 --> 02:29:15.367]  Like Tchaikovsky.
[02:29:15.367 --> 02:29:15.547]  Right.
[02:29:18.382 --> 02:29:20.482]  Was like, are you kidding me?
[02:29:20.482 --> 02:29:23.583]  You don't even have on paper what is going on here.
[02:29:23.583 --> 02:29:25.624]  Do you realize what's happening in Poland?
[02:29:25.624 --> 02:29:29.404]  Do you realize what's happening in Eastern Europe and Romania and all these other places?
[02:29:29.404 --> 02:29:30.324]  Do you have any clue?
[02:29:30.324 --> 02:29:35.365]  I mean, would you even be able to last for a day there without losing your mind?
[02:29:35.365 --> 02:29:38.066]  And I think that that's where we're at right now.
[02:29:38.066 --> 02:29:44.747]  The level of cynicism in this country has gotten to the point where people are saying, is there hope left for the Republic?
[02:29:44.747 --> 02:29:46.088]  Can we save it?
[02:29:46.088 --> 02:29:47.168]  Is it worth saving?
[02:29:50.356 --> 02:29:54.280]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.280 --> 02:29:56.942]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.791 --> 02:30:08.014]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:30:08.014 --> 02:30:25.883]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:30:25.883 --> 02:30:30.005]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[02:30:30.285 --> 02:30:32.046]  And discovered Young-Jevity.

[02:32:04.602 --> 02:32:05.862]  Tyranny is here.
[02:32:05.862 --> 02:32:09.383]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:32:09.383 --> 02:32:12.184]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:32:12.184 --> 02:32:17.886]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:32:17.886 --> 02:32:24.548]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:32:24.548 --> 02:32:30.510]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:32:30.510 --> 02:32:34.191]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[02:32:34.711 --> 02:32:38.992]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.

[02:32:44.954 --> 02:32:48.496]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:32:48.496 --> 02:32:50.476]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:32:50.476 --> 02:32:51.597]  It's here.

[02:33:14.166 --> 02:33:21.829]  I always tell people when they come to me, they say, oh, you know, revolution, you have a lot of revolutionary figures from Latin America that are from the left wing.
[02:33:21.829 --> 02:33:26.331]  I explain to people, our revolution doesn't come with socialism or communism.
[02:33:26.331 --> 02:33:29.352]  That's an adverse effect of America's pressure.
[02:33:29.352 --> 02:33:37.495]  Originally, we heard the great prognosticator of democracy come down to Latin America at a time when we had a series of horrible imperialist
[02:33:37.875 --> 02:33:38.155]  That's
[02:33:56.059 --> 02:34:01.684]  When people were saying, you can have a democracy and you can vote for your own leaders, we thought, that's wonderful!
[02:34:01.684 --> 02:34:02.985]  What a great idea!
[02:34:02.985 --> 02:34:16.978]  And then, the great proselytizer of democracy, we realized, was the same one backing up Stroessner, Batista, you know, the imperialist governments that existed in Latin America.
[02:34:16.978 --> 02:34:21.802]  And the country and the people of Latin America said, what else do you have on the table?
[02:34:22.102 --> 02:34:23.603]  Who else has something besides this?
[02:34:23.603 --> 02:34:24.544]  And the Soviets came.
[02:34:24.544 --> 02:34:26.385]  And the Soviets and the Chinese came.
[02:34:26.385 --> 02:34:42.956]  And I explain to people, yes, that's a natural part of our society, but what we have to explain to individuals is we didn't need a European man to come from the 19th century and explain to us dark people in Latin America the complex concept.
[02:34:42.956 --> 02:34:44.457]  Plus, anybody from Europe
[02:34:44.617 --> 02:34:44.757]  Yes.
[02:35:05.249 --> 02:35:07.790]  Fake grassroots movement that they can control.
[02:35:07.790 --> 02:35:10.471]  So it's the same thing with the Soviets going in there.
[02:35:10.471 --> 02:35:11.411]  Absolutely.
[02:35:11.411 --> 02:35:17.213]  It's like running from Bush to Obama and then running from Obama to Mitt Romney.
[02:35:17.213 --> 02:35:18.514]  They're all part of the same thing.
[02:35:18.514 --> 02:35:21.935]  So what do you say for America and Latin America and the world?
[02:35:23.355 --> 02:35:34.663]  What is at your core, moral technique, tech, what is at the core of your belief, studying this so long, being an articulate, smart guy who's been around the world, from your historical research, then what system do you like?
[02:35:34.663 --> 02:35:39.706]  Because, look, you've got Peter Thiel, the big Bilderberg guy, trying to take over the libertarian movement right now.
[02:35:39.946 --> 02:35:40.066]  I'm
[02:35:54.943 --> 02:35:59.746]  And then, you know, you turn around and it looks like what you thought it was, but it isn't.
[02:35:59.746 --> 02:36:08.412]  Now, when you discuss all of these issues that are going on in the world, I think what people don't do is they don't connect the actual history to it.
[02:36:08.412 --> 02:36:14.196]  And I think that's where I try to implement that to them, or implement those ideas.
[02:36:14.196 --> 02:36:19.640]  When I say, hey, listen, if you look at the history of Russia and the quote-unquote USSR bringing freedom,
[02:36:20.240 --> 02:36:22.482]  Did they bring freedom to Eastern Europe?
[02:36:22.482 --> 02:36:24.084]  No, they brought mass murder and death.
[02:36:24.084 --> 02:36:29.989]  You have to understand, they did the same thing to Eastern Europe that America did to Central America and to the Caribbean.
[02:36:29.989 --> 02:36:30.630]  They colonized it.
[02:36:30.630 --> 02:36:30.890]  Right.
[02:36:30.890 --> 02:36:35.434]  Colonized it, took it over, and said, you know what, we're going to make you dependent on us.
[02:36:35.434 --> 02:36:39.558]  To the point that they can still shut off the gas in the Ukraine five years ago.
[02:36:39.758 --> 02:36:40.999]  This is not a conspiracy.
[02:36:40.999 --> 02:36:46.361]  People talk to me about 9-11 and they say, hey, you know, how can you not believe the government story?
[02:36:46.361 --> 02:36:51.304]  And I always say, listen, I am not sitting here saying that I know exactly what happened.
[02:36:51.304 --> 02:36:52.084]  But you know what?
[02:36:52.084 --> 02:36:53.425]  I will say this much.
[02:36:53.425 --> 02:36:58.247]  I cannot believe the government because they couldn't tell the truth about the air to breathe to people.
[02:36:58.247 --> 02:37:00.008]  That's the simplest thing in the world.
[02:37:00.008 --> 02:37:04.951]  That said, if they've been caught lying over and over and over again and caught doing false flags, you've got to question it.
[02:37:05.831 --> 02:37:12.419]  Breaking that down, sure, you've had colonial powers, and the British are the most successful model, so it's been adopted by the corporations.
[02:37:12.419 --> 02:37:15.002]  Reinforced with religion.
[02:37:15.002 --> 02:37:17.004]  Reinforced with neoliberalism now.
[02:37:17.004 --> 02:37:18.686]  Sure, well that's their cover.
[02:37:18.686 --> 02:37:20.148]  I mean, it's like giving Obama a peace prize.
[02:37:20.148 --> 02:37:21.890]  But what I'm saying is, now...
[02:37:22.651 --> 02:37:28.356]  They put out that Dinesh D'Souza film, and I interviewed him, and he's saying Obama is anti-colonialist.
[02:37:28.356 --> 02:37:30.398]  That's why he's doing all this stuff.
[02:37:30.398 --> 02:37:31.939]  And it's the opposite.
[02:37:31.939 --> 02:37:36.163]  Obama has a CIA cover as an anti-colonialist.
[02:37:36.163 --> 02:37:44.771]  But clearly, his job is to bring in global corporate colonialism that's so powerful now, the banks are above the law.
[02:37:45.091 --> 02:37:52.074]  They issue the money, and they're going to dissolve the countries and even the old empires into one global empire.
[02:37:52.074 --> 02:37:54.135]  And then what's its ideology?
[02:37:54.135 --> 02:38:05.020]  Other empires were domination, total control, but most empires, unless it was Hitler, and what he tried to establish as the Neo-Germanic Empire, did not want to exterminate everybody.
[02:38:05.020 --> 02:38:09.923]  That had been done some with the natives in some of the areas, but this is a eugenics-based exterminism.
[02:38:10.723 --> 02:38:23.763]  Which isn't fair to say ultra-Hitlerian, because Hitler got his ideas from these people, so how do you talk to the left, the right, the people that are into native rights, people that are UN stuff, when all of it's a projection of a global corporate takeover?
[02:38:23.763 --> 02:38:25.966]  Because they have these ideas...
[02:38:26.787 --> 02:38:30.271]  Based on mainstream media about who we're fighting against.
[02:38:30.271 --> 02:38:36.078]  You know, for example, if you tell the average American, we're not at war with radical Islam, they think you're crazy.
[02:38:36.078 --> 02:38:38.420]  They say, oh no, we're not at war with communism.
[02:38:38.420 --> 02:38:41.664]  They think you're insane until you say, hey, wait a minute, we're not
[02:38:41.664 --> 02:38:43.105]  We're at war with radical Islam.
[02:38:43.105 --> 02:38:45.265]  Because who's our biggest ally in the region?
[02:38:45.265 --> 02:38:46.426]  Saudi Arabia.
[02:38:46.426 --> 02:38:50.147]  Their brand of Wahhabism is like the Taliban with money.
[02:38:50.147 --> 02:38:52.808]  And they have the influence to interfere in Syria.
[02:38:52.808 --> 02:38:54.369]  Then, what about communism?
[02:38:54.369 --> 02:38:56.149]  And they say, oh, we're not against communism.
[02:38:56.149 --> 02:38:57.570]  Oh, how could you say that?
[02:38:57.570 --> 02:38:59.691]  Who's our biggest economic partner?
[02:38:59.691 --> 02:38:59.971]  China.
[02:38:59.971 --> 02:39:00.791]  China.
[02:39:00.791 --> 02:39:04.252]  So, you know who we're really at war with and I tell people all the time?
[02:39:04.252 --> 02:39:07.214]  We're at war with people that say no to us.
[02:39:07.214 --> 02:39:10.315]  No to the agenda of the people who run behind guns.
[02:39:10.315 --> 02:39:10.715]  The mafia.
[02:39:11.415 --> 02:39:13.277]  That's technically how it is.
[02:39:13.277 --> 02:39:20.626]  I mean, if we don't give access to natural resources as a third world entity, we find ourselves on a hit list.
[02:39:20.626 --> 02:39:21.026]  You know?
[02:39:21.026 --> 02:39:24.230]  You find yourself being persecuted, being brought down.
[02:39:24.230 --> 02:39:25.691]  If you try to be sovereign.
[02:39:25.691 --> 02:39:26.152]  It doesn't matter.
[02:39:26.152 --> 02:39:33.977]  It doesn't matter if you're a communist government, or it doesn't matter if you are a capitalist entity that just wants a little more of the slice.
[02:39:33.977 --> 02:39:42.743]  They'll portray you, one, as a Stalinist, or two, they'll portray you as a kleptocracy, when in reality, who are you stealing money for?
[02:39:43.283 --> 02:39:43.983]  You!
[02:39:43.983 --> 02:39:49.165]  We just didn't want to cut you in anymore because you felt like, as America, you weren't doing enough to get your slice.
[02:39:49.165 --> 02:39:52.906]  You know a lot of the Republicans are racist or tribal, or are using it at least.
[02:39:52.906 --> 02:39:57.027]  But with Democrats, from my real research, they were the party of the Klan.
[02:39:57.027 --> 02:39:58.468]  They were the party of the South.
[02:39:58.468 --> 02:40:00.708]  They couldn't win.
[02:40:00.708 --> 02:40:09.251]  And so Margaret Sanger and the Rockefellers, and I've got their memos, those are public, those are in the Library of Congress, they said, we're going to oppose as liberals, we're going to hire the black leaders, we're going to kill these weeds.
[02:40:09.831 --> 02:40:11.713]  I don't think black people are weeds.
[02:40:11.713 --> 02:40:14.255]  Not because I'm some bleeding heart person.
[02:40:14.255 --> 02:40:16.317]  I don't want any people being treated like slaves.
[02:40:16.317 --> 02:40:19.200]  Because I know we're all humans and it all comes back on us.
[02:40:19.200 --> 02:40:20.301]  So I've said that.
[02:40:20.301 --> 02:40:24.465]  Your take on the Nancy Pelosi's, the Harry Reid's, the neo-liberals.
[02:40:24.465 --> 02:40:27.848]  Because from my research, they know they're not liberals.
[02:40:27.848 --> 02:40:29.389]  These people are hard.
[02:40:29.389 --> 02:40:30.570]  You want the real racists?
[02:40:31.391 --> 02:40:33.853]  Because Republicans will just use it for control.
[02:40:33.853 --> 02:40:39.158]  You want the real racist, look at how they use both sides.
[02:40:39.158 --> 02:40:46.165]  I think that what people don't realize is that when you use code language to talk about people,
[02:40:46.665 --> 02:40:46.845]  I think?
[02:41:06.238 --> 02:41:11.341]  The actual end result of some of the policies of Democrats at that specific time.
[02:41:11.341 --> 02:41:11.921]  You know what I mean?
[02:41:11.921 --> 02:41:14.963]  I think, for example, Obama gets a huge pass.
[02:41:14.963 --> 02:41:16.924]  I wanted to ask him this.
[02:41:16.924 --> 02:41:20.867]  I really hope when he gets out of office, I say to him, you know what?
[02:41:21.687 --> 02:41:26.048]  I saw you on TV shed tears for children from Sandy Hook.
[02:41:26.048 --> 02:41:28.009]  Totally fake.
[02:41:28.009 --> 02:41:43.792]  Without even that, without injecting that material into the conversation, I want to ask him, how many tears have you ever shed for the children of Pakistan, for the children of Yemen, for the children of Gaza, whose drones and planes sponsored by America fly over and kill them?
[02:41:43.792 --> 02:41:45.553]  Have you shed one tear for them?
[02:41:46.113 --> 02:41:46.834]  You know what I mean?
[02:41:46.834 --> 02:41:50.618]  Have you said one prayer in your private quiet time?
[02:41:50.618 --> 02:41:53.220]  Because if you have, I've never heard it.
[02:41:53.220 --> 02:41:57.304]  And maybe you don't think it's popular enough to do, but it's necessary.
[02:41:57.304 --> 02:42:04.412]  Two, I think that when you talk about a liberal bias, or when you talk about any of these aspects of society,
[02:42:06.112 --> 02:42:09.656]  You can frame it in whatever way you want to, right?
[02:42:09.656 --> 02:42:16.142]  But if you are still controlled by the people economically, it doesn't matter what you claim to be.
[02:42:16.142 --> 02:42:24.330]  In other words, if I say, I'm a martial artist, Alex, and yet some guy comes in and lays me out with one punch, I don't know a simple block, I'm not a martial artist.
[02:42:24.330 --> 02:42:29.756]  If I claim, oh yeah, you know, I'm a doctor, you are eating something, you start choking, I can't even perform the Heimlich.
[02:42:30.316 --> 02:42:32.637]  I'm not a doctor, I'm a fraud!
[02:42:32.637 --> 02:42:42.383]  Most of these people that are out there that permeate this sort of idea that they're some bleeding heart, I don't see them on the front lines of this stuff.
[02:42:42.383 --> 02:42:45.665]  I don't see them willing to get their hands dirty.
[02:42:45.665 --> 02:42:47.686]  They're like Pontius Pilate.
[02:42:47.686 --> 02:42:49.166]  This isn't my problem.
[02:42:49.166 --> 02:42:56.090]  You know, in the same way that we look at it and we say, oh, America came to the rescue of Jewish people in World War II.
[02:42:56.090 --> 02:42:56.911]  No, you didn't.
[02:42:56.911 --> 02:42:57.891]  You sent the St.
[02:42:57.891 --> 02:42:58.472]  Louis back.
[02:42:59.625 --> 02:43:00.326]  That's what you did.
[02:43:00.326 --> 02:43:01.327]  You know what I mean?
[02:43:01.327 --> 02:43:03.789]  Don't sit here and recreate a lie.
[02:43:03.789 --> 02:43:06.132]  Our elite funded Hitler.
[02:43:06.132 --> 02:43:11.417]  We have a guy that we have commemorated called Christopher Columbus, right?
[02:43:11.417 --> 02:43:21.547]  And I always tell Catholics and Italians, you can find somebody better from the Catholic Church, even though in my mind the institution itself is corrupt.
[02:43:21.547 --> 02:43:22.729]  You can find somebody
[02:43:23.169 --> 02:43:24.270]  Like a bishop?
[02:43:24.270 --> 02:43:25.550]  Mother Teresa?
[02:43:25.550 --> 02:43:27.372]  Anybody who's a better example.
[02:43:27.372 --> 02:43:39.419]  Italians, you can find a mother****** who sells pizza in Brooklyn right now, who's a better example of an Italian-American than Christopher Columbus, who never even touched America, and who was prostituting eight and nine year old girls.
[02:43:40.339 --> 02:43:46.488]  Eight and nine year old indigenous women, that should break the heart of every parent who's watching this program right now.
[02:43:46.488 --> 02:43:48.511]  You know, if we don't confront that.
[02:43:48.511 --> 02:43:50.995]  But see, it's the dehumanization.
[02:43:50.995 --> 02:43:56.242]  It's just like Obama decided to flip the switch and cry for the Sandy Hook because it was an agenda.
[02:43:57.303 --> 02:43:57.844]  I don't know.
[02:44:13.018 --> 02:44:18.362]  I know that you are a supporter of Israel, to a certain degree.
[02:44:18.362 --> 02:44:21.045]  At least someone's told me that.
[02:44:21.045 --> 02:44:22.226]  I don't know if that's true.
[02:44:22.226 --> 02:44:28.671]  What do you think about the way that Palestinians are disenfranchised of their human rights?
[02:44:28.671 --> 02:44:32.994]  We're not with the Newt Gingrich crowd here, that they're an invented people.
[02:44:32.994 --> 02:44:35.917]  Because when he said that, I was like, what are Americans?
[02:44:36.297 --> 02:44:36.877]  You know what I mean?
[02:44:36.877 --> 02:44:40.020]  A collective of European people that didn't want to be ruled.
[02:44:40.020 --> 02:44:45.204]  No, I mean clearly the people that got kicked out of that area of Israel or Palestine are Palestinians.
[02:44:45.204 --> 02:44:46.785]  The people that lived in Palestine.
[02:44:46.785 --> 02:44:51.788]  Yeah, so it's like... I think there's sometimes... Listen, that's all a misrepresentation.
[02:44:51.788 --> 02:44:52.369]  Right.
[02:44:52.369 --> 02:44:56.172]  Just like at the start of the interview, they take like a 15 year old clip
[02:44:56.912 --> 02:44:57.653]  Right.
[02:44:57.653 --> 02:45:16.205]  Out of context, where I'm saying, I said, now from the perspective though, the UN is against Israel, they're playing both sides, so then from that perspective, I, and you watch, people will cut this out, I said, I support the state of Israel's right to exist, and then I went on to say, but I don't support what they're doing.
[02:45:16.205 --> 02:45:20.468]  Now that was like 14, 15 years ago, I guess I'm like 1998, so 14, 15 years ago.
[02:45:20.468 --> 02:45:21.669]  Because I always thought to myself,
[02:45:22.509 --> 02:45:24.050]  But had you seen that clip?
[02:45:24.050 --> 02:45:24.390]  No, no.
[02:45:24.390 --> 02:45:27.671]  Someone had played an excerpt of it, which is why I wanted to ask.
[02:45:27.671 --> 02:45:29.532]  Yeah, some people like to play audio.
[02:45:29.532 --> 02:45:30.092]  That's the point.
[02:45:30.092 --> 02:45:33.373]  I wanted to say... Actually, I like the video because I'm about 60 pounds lighter.
[02:45:33.373 --> 02:45:35.354]  No, but let's go back here for just a minute.
[02:45:35.354 --> 02:45:44.118]  Where I stand is talking about Israel helping create fake Al-Qaeda, Israel manipulating our internal politics, Israel attacking the USS Liberty.
[02:45:44.118 --> 02:45:45.578]  I've made films about it.
[02:45:45.578 --> 02:45:46.399]  I've criticized it.
[02:45:47.179 --> 02:45:52.205]  But there's a cult of people that then make everything about Israel and only about Israel.
[02:45:52.205 --> 02:45:55.428]  And so they edit things and change things.
[02:45:55.428 --> 02:45:59.433]  And, you know, they've got me saying kill black people online, but I didn't say that.
[02:45:59.433 --> 02:46:01.696]  So so a lot of that is not as you were shown.
[02:46:02.376 --> 02:46:05.859]  No, no, no, but that's why I'm here to talk to you about it.
[02:46:25.757 --> 02:46:26.618]  Right.
[02:46:26.618 --> 02:46:32.284]  I mean, I think that communism and socialism are a natural part of human development, whether you choose to accept that or not.
[02:46:32.284 --> 02:46:43.495]  No, I know, but what I'm saying is there's a massive amount of disinformation out there, and no matter how many times I say I don't support a lot of what Israel's doing, they spin that and say that means unconditional support for Israel.
[02:46:43.495 --> 02:46:44.436]  That's not what's happening.
[02:46:44.436 --> 02:46:44.556]  Right.
[02:46:45.937 --> 02:46:47.678]  No, I know it's a colonial operation.
[02:46:47.678 --> 02:46:51.459]  The point is, and I've said that in the news, no one ever quotes that.
[02:46:51.459 --> 02:46:55.920]  They take a 14-year-old thing out of context and twist it, so I say let them have it.
[02:46:55.920 --> 02:46:57.180]  You know, they say I'm a Jewish agent.
[02:46:57.180 --> 02:46:57.721]  I'm Jewish.
[02:46:57.721 --> 02:46:58.861]  Not true, but hey, okay.
[02:46:58.861 --> 02:47:00.702]  They say I'm a reptoid.
[02:47:00.702 --> 02:47:02.822]  You know, they say... Mazel Tov.
[02:47:02.822 --> 02:47:03.742]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:47:03.742 --> 02:47:05.563]  So my whole deal is you bet I am.
[02:47:05.563 --> 02:47:06.623]  They also say I'm KGB.
[02:47:06.623 --> 02:47:07.664]  You bet I am.
[02:47:07.664 --> 02:47:11.745]  No, actually, I'm a guy who loves liberty and justice, who's really trying to figure it all out.
[02:47:12.105 --> 02:47:25.168]  Well, when people have always tried to pull the Marxist card with me, I've said, you know what, the difference between you and me is I've actually read that book because I had to study it to understand how much control people wanted over a society.
[02:47:25.168 --> 02:47:33.669]  And when I was done with that, I said to myself, wow, it reminds me, and you mentioned it before, the great KRS-One who said, there's no such thing as a government.
[02:47:33.669 --> 02:47:36.410]  It's just people who rule over other people.
[02:47:36.410 --> 02:47:40.891]  And they design these little fancy systems so it looks like they're bringing freedom
[02:47:41.531 --> 02:47:43.032]  Or they're bringing order.
[02:47:43.032 --> 02:47:56.022]  And America, the sad part is we are so cynical right now that I know people who are lovers of democracy that say, I'd rather see a king that could get something done and balance the budget than a president that can't do anything.
[02:47:56.022 --> 02:47:57.943]  The system makes it worse and worse!
[02:47:57.943 --> 02:47:59.785]  And that's where they want us to be.
[02:47:59.785 --> 02:48:02.427]  Here's the key, and we'll look right in the camera and say this, right here.
[02:48:02.427 --> 02:48:04.248]  Here's the key to all of this.
[02:48:04.248 --> 02:48:04.989]  Just what he just said.
[02:48:05.589 --> 02:48:07.250]  The system is running this.
[02:48:07.250 --> 02:48:10.392]  We don't blame it all on them, but 90% of it is the way things are ordered.
[02:48:10.392 --> 02:48:13.214]  Humans are unlimitedly productive and incredible.
[02:48:13.214 --> 02:48:14.735]  History's shown that.
[02:48:14.735 --> 02:48:17.817]  And the system is doing almost all of this.
[02:48:17.817 --> 02:48:19.798]  And then it says, oh, look at what happened.
[02:48:19.798 --> 02:48:20.999]  Give me more power.
[02:48:20.999 --> 02:48:22.360]  And then it gets worse and worse.
[02:48:22.360 --> 02:48:22.860]  That's the key.
[02:48:23.180 --> 02:48:23.741]  Right.
[02:48:23.741 --> 02:48:36.632]  And I think that that gets lost in the right-versus-left paradigm because there are still very, very rich people from the left wing, supposedly, that don't want to have anything to do with urban society.
[02:48:36.632 --> 02:48:37.232]  They say to themselves,
[02:48:39.201 --> 02:48:39.461]  That's
[02:48:59.833 --> 02:49:03.477]  Please pardon me if someone wants to debate it, I totally can out there.
[02:49:03.477 --> 02:49:06.700]  He didn't have a gigantic amount of accolades to run on.
[02:49:06.700 --> 02:49:18.133]  I specifically remember them using in the media the fact that he was the editor of the Harvard Law Review as a selling point for his ability to run the government.
[02:49:18.133 --> 02:49:19.194]  And I always said to myself,
[02:49:19.714 --> 02:49:24.436]  Where do you meet the future movers and shakers of society in private school?
[02:49:24.436 --> 02:49:47.866]  However, if you as a rich, liberal individual step back and say, well, I don't need to fund public school because that's not my problem, then don't complain when some poor, uneducated individual who didn't have a chance, who had every single aspect of his freedom infringed upon by police, who couldn't get a regular job, had a felony at 18, and is now robbing and stealing, blows your kid's head off just to steal his
[02:49:48.226 --> 02:49:48.746]  I don't
[02:50:12.062 --> 02:50:17.506]  They want their business exported from here, and yet they want to sell to people from here.
[02:50:17.506 --> 02:50:29.074]  They don't want to pay their fair share of what it costs to run this country, what it costs for the military to back up those areas where they're taking natural resources out of, but they want all the benefits of it.
[02:50:29.074 --> 02:50:33.237]  In other words, they want to have sex with America, but they don't want to marry her.
[02:50:33.237 --> 02:50:34.578]  They're whoring her out.
[02:50:34.578 --> 02:50:38.000]  And I have no respect for those type of people, whether they come from the left,
[02:50:38.360 --> 02:50:46.526]  Whether they come from the right, and unfortunately I tell people, what you're going to have to deal with now, Alex, is a whole lot of frauds coming into the libertarian movement.
[02:51:01.877 --> 02:51:03.438]  Your freedoms are on the line.
[02:51:03.438 --> 02:51:05.239]  The Second Amendment is in danger.
[02:51:05.239 --> 02:51:07.581]  How soon before your freedoms are taken away?
[02:51:07.581 --> 02:51:09.302]  What can you not live without?
[02:51:09.302 --> 02:51:11.023]  What is your greatest dependency?
[02:51:11.023 --> 02:51:12.003]  Is it your guns?
[02:51:12.003 --> 02:51:12.964]  Is it your home?
[02:51:12.964 --> 02:51:14.385]  No, it's food.
[02:51:14.385 --> 02:51:16.486]  It all boils down to the food supply.
[02:51:16.486 --> 02:51:19.989]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[02:51:19.989 --> 02:51:21.229]  Don't be dependent.
[02:51:21.229 --> 02:51:22.150]  Be self-sufficient.
[02:51:22.310 --> 02:51:23.971]  Don't wait for the government to feed you.
[02:51:23.971 --> 02:51:25.071]  Feed yourself.
[02:51:25.071 --> 02:51:27.312]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[02:51:27.312 --> 02:51:30.873]  Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from eFoods Direct.
[02:51:30.873 --> 02:51:33.614]  It's the best long-term storable food on the planet.
[02:51:33.614 --> 02:51:35.955]  Get the popular Mega Patriot Pack free.
[02:51:35.955 --> 02:51:38.456]  A 24-day supply of food plus stove, cooker,
[02:51:38.676 --> 02:51:39.196]  I think so.
[02:52:01.511 --> 02:52:04.113]  Hey everybody, Ty Bollinger here once again.
[02:52:04.113 --> 02:52:06.135]  Real life, real stories.
[02:52:06.135 --> 02:52:07.756]  And he discovered Carnivora.
[02:52:07.756 --> 02:52:12.881]  He was so thrilled with the product that he shared it with his family and his friends and his patients.
[02:52:12.881 --> 02:52:15.283]  My dad was a family physician, he was a medical doctor.
[02:52:15.283 --> 02:52:18.185]  Almost all the symptoms were either diminished or gone.
[02:52:18.185 --> 02:52:20.367]  Amazing product, amazing results.
[02:52:20.367 --> 02:52:27.633]  It's like an amazing thing having such a profound change in how I feel and knowing that it was Carnivora that did it.
[02:52:27.993 --> 02:52:30.016]  And a lot of patients got better.
[02:52:30.016 --> 02:52:34.300]  Ranging from immune dysfunction to allergies and infection.

[02:53:24.557 --> 02:53:27.959]  You could buy three Survival Seed Vaults for less than one of theirs.

[02:53:54.517 --> 02:53:55.499]  A man who walks with God.
[02:54:08.945 --> 02:54:12.847]  All the race stuff and all the fighting and all the crap doesn't matter.
[02:54:12.847 --> 02:54:23.012]  In the final equation, I don't care if you're some rich white yuppie or some poor inner city white person or whatever it is, you are having chemical and bio weapons putting the air and the food in the water.
[02:54:23.012 --> 02:54:29.155]  They're testing on you just getting ready for their big move because they already have the life extension technologies.
[02:54:29.155 --> 02:54:30.156]  And the motive is
[02:54:31.016 --> 02:54:35.000]  The moral technique is they don't want you to have that.
[02:54:35.000 --> 02:54:38.743]  Like the guy says, I will destroy your seed forever and last the Mohicans.
[02:54:38.743 --> 02:54:40.885]  The globalists, all ancient groups run to that.
[02:54:40.885 --> 02:54:42.907]  They want all of our seed destroyed.
[02:54:42.907 --> 02:54:44.428]  We're not going to be part of the future.
[02:54:44.428 --> 02:54:48.432]  The ultimate Roman takeover was to kill the whole population and salt the earth.
[02:54:48.432 --> 02:54:52.575]  The globalists are salting the earth with GMO while building their underground seed vaults.
[02:54:52.575 --> 02:54:53.216]  It's Moonraker.
[02:54:53.436 --> 02:54:55.257]  Ian Fleming, MI6, wrote that.
[02:54:55.257 --> 02:54:56.398]  Moonraker's real!
[02:54:56.398 --> 02:55:03.002]  And when people say to me, they say, oh, you know, are you drinking that left-wing Kool-Aid?
[02:55:03.002 --> 02:55:07.085]  I always say to them, it tastes just as good as the right-wing Monsanto's milk.
[02:55:07.898 --> 02:55:15.824]  Because no matter which one you want and which one you're willing to absorb, I think you have to get past this paradigm.
[02:55:15.824 --> 02:55:21.629]  And I think that's where programs like this and what I do, you know, we don't have to agree about every single thing.
[02:55:21.629 --> 02:55:27.093]  But what we do agree about is that we don't want people to believe everything that we say.
[02:55:27.093 --> 02:55:29.035]  We want people to question everything.
[02:55:29.035 --> 02:55:30.296]  Full spectrum analysis.
[02:55:30.296 --> 02:55:30.496]  Yes.
[02:55:30.856 --> 02:55:35.597]  But then that can also go to the extreme where without proof people just make up, well this guy's this or this guy's that.
[02:55:35.597 --> 02:55:39.218]  In closing, The Martyr, tell us about the music.
[02:55:39.218 --> 02:55:42.099]  The Martyr is a 100% free album.
[02:55:42.099 --> 02:55:46.240]  And when I say free, you can go to Viper Records right now and you can get it.
[02:55:46.240 --> 02:55:50.842]  It features all the people that I have worked with over these years have been a part of this.
[02:55:50.842 --> 02:55:51.582]  We gave it for free.
[02:55:52.082 --> 02:55:54.825]  And when I say free, you don't have to fill out a survey.
[02:55:54.825 --> 02:55:56.787]  No 22nd Vivo commercial.
[02:55:56.787 --> 02:55:58.029]  You press one button.
[02:55:58.029 --> 02:55:59.750]  It's an absolutely free album.
[02:55:59.750 --> 02:56:05.076]  And the beauty of it was that I wanted to show people you don't have to die for revolution, Alex.
[02:56:05.076 --> 02:56:05.877]  That's not the point.
[02:56:05.877 --> 02:56:07.078]  Gotta stop believing in the system.
[02:56:07.719 --> 02:56:09.900]  You have to live for revolution.
[02:56:09.900 --> 02:56:10.840]  That's what they're afraid of.
[02:56:10.840 --> 02:56:11.540]  I like that.
[02:56:11.540 --> 02:56:12.620]  They're afraid of that.
[02:56:12.620 --> 02:56:14.581]  You don't have to die for revolution, you gotta live for it.
[02:56:14.581 --> 02:56:15.421]  You have to live for it.
[02:56:15.421 --> 02:56:16.401]  Change your way of life.
[02:56:16.401 --> 02:56:26.524]  It's easier for someone to sit there and say, you know, I'm gonna go out in a blaze of glory tomorrow, and I'm really gonna make them pay, as opposed to say, you know what?
[02:56:26.524 --> 02:56:32.246]  I'm gonna go through the painstaking suffering of raising a boy and two little girls in this
[02:56:33.306 --> 02:56:42.091]  Damn near fascist society in order to raise them to look at the world differently and to see... It's a long haul, beautifully said.
[02:56:42.091 --> 02:56:47.615]  Let me ask you this, the immortal technique, that sounds like evergreen or an idea that transcends time.
[02:56:47.615 --> 02:56:50.977]  Tell me what immortal technique means and how you came up with that name.
[02:56:50.977 --> 02:56:54.979]  Well, originally, you know, when I was incarcerated,
[02:56:56.767 --> 02:56:57.828]  My name was just Technique.
[02:56:57.828 --> 02:56:59.129]  That's just what I went by.
[02:56:59.129 --> 02:57:03.131]  And I always remember there was a Native American trustee named Judge.
[02:57:03.131 --> 02:57:06.614]  He brought me a pen and a paper while I was in the hole.
[02:57:06.614 --> 02:57:10.616]  And I wrote a song on the first record I had called The Prophecy.
[02:57:10.616 --> 02:57:18.521]  And I thought to myself, you know, in order for me to get my message across, it's going to have to span years of time.
[02:57:18.521 --> 02:57:19.582]  You know what I mean?
[02:57:19.582 --> 02:57:25.086]  What's going on right now, as you pointed out, as I pointed out through history, has happened before.
[02:57:25.686 --> 02:57:27.347]  People have taken this away.
[02:57:27.347 --> 02:57:28.968]  People have taken that away.
[02:57:28.968 --> 02:57:30.909]  People have manipulated the system.
[02:57:30.909 --> 02:57:33.871]  People have used a proxy to get what they want done.
[02:57:33.871 --> 02:57:40.335]  People have put a smiling face off on things that really have the fangs of a vampire at some point.
[02:57:41.155 --> 02:57:43.516]  We have to analyze this throughout history.
[02:57:43.516 --> 02:57:49.779]  And also, I'm a man who believes in God and I believe that, you know, a man that walks with God can walk anywhere.
[02:57:49.779 --> 02:57:51.200]  So I don't fear death.
[02:57:51.200 --> 02:58:00.405]  I don't fear people trying to marginalize my point and my perspective because I challenge them to meet me on the field of intellectual battle anytime, anywhere.
[02:58:00.405 --> 02:58:06.088]  Just give me, you know, a few days notice so, you know, I can buy your mother a suit.
[02:58:06.088 --> 02:58:06.408]  That's all.
[02:58:07.953 --> 02:58:15.977]  Oh man, well listen, you gotta promise me that whenever you come through Texas, you'll come into the studio, and you gotta promise every couple months you'll come on via video Skype.
[02:58:15.977 --> 02:58:17.037]  I'll try my best, man.
[02:58:17.037 --> 02:58:18.378]  Thank you very much for having me on the show.
[02:58:18.378 --> 02:58:18.638]  You bet.
[02:58:18.638 --> 02:58:19.418]  It's been amazing.
[02:58:19.418 --> 02:58:19.938]  Thank you very much.
[02:58:19.938 --> 02:58:20.318]  Thank you.
[02:58:20.318 --> 02:58:21.279]  Very powerful.
[02:58:21.279 --> 02:58:26.201]  InfoWars, Free Palestine, all the immigrants, can't demonize us all.
[02:58:26.201 --> 02:58:28.222]  This is a nation of immigrants.
[02:58:28.222 --> 02:58:31.843]  Read Between the Lines, InfoWars, Immortal Technique, Alex Jones.
[02:58:39.490 --> 02:58:46.155]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
