[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:21.000]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:21.000 --> 00:31.000]  All right, welcome to the broadcast. Welcome to the Alex Jones Show. This is Mike Adams,
[00:31.000 --> 00:36.440]  the Health Ranger, filling in for Alex today on this Friday, March 1st. Yes, we've entered
[00:36.440 --> 00:43.600]  March of 2013. That reminds me, let's see, Max Keiser's got his prediction coming up in April
[00:43.600 --> 00:51.960]  of a major economic event. So I'm kind of curious to see if that's happening. We tick one month
[00:51.960 --> 00:59.600]  closer to that today, being March 1st. So we've got a lot of news today. We've got mind melds of
[00:59.600 --> 01:05.120]  rats, something straight out of science fiction. They're actually merging the minds of two rats
[01:05.120 --> 01:13.120]  in the laboratory and creating a, I don't know, a dual mind machine. And obviously, everything
[01:13.120 --> 01:18.480]  they do to rats, they're gonna eventually do to you. So they're gonna have human experiments
[01:18.480 --> 01:24.360]  before long once they figure out how this can serve the globalist agenda. We're gonna be covering
[01:24.360 --> 01:29.960]  that. But let me tell you what's really coming up today. We got a lot of big news. At the bottom of
[01:29.960 --> 01:35.480]  this hour, we have Joe Dixon joining us from Morningland Dairy. They were raided, I believe,
[01:35.480 --> 01:41.200]  at gunpoint. We're gonna get to the bottom of those details in Missouri. That raid happened,
[01:41.200 --> 01:44.760]  the raid actually happened a while back, but there have been a lot of developments in that.
[01:44.760 --> 01:50.480]  Raw milk is back on the scene again because, see, when you get into the whole Second Amendment and
[01:50.480 --> 01:56.800]  the gun rights debate, you have to look at, well, what does government do when it has a monopoly on
[01:56.800 --> 02:02.600]  guns? And if you look at the actual history, recent history, you know, just the last couple
[02:02.600 --> 02:10.560]  of years, it turns out that when government has guns, it uses them to intimidate and raid raw milk
[02:10.560 --> 02:18.680]  farmers, people selling milk. James Stewart was raided at gunpoint. And Joe Dixon here,
[02:18.680 --> 02:24.280]  his farm was raided and temporarily shut down, and they've gone after him and many others.
[02:24.280 --> 02:32.480]  So this is a food freedom issue as well as a gun rights issue altogether. And so we're gonna be
[02:32.480 --> 02:37.760]  covering that in more detail. We've also got coming up a little bit later today, Ashal Eldridge,
[02:37.760 --> 02:46.240]  also known as Seasons. He is the rap artist who has created an amazing new music video and song,
[02:46.240 --> 02:51.960]  kind of like a mini movie actually, mini drama called Food Fight, that is all about inner city
[02:51.960 --> 03:00.000]  citizens being killed by processed food, being killed by the GMO, by the aspartame, by the
[03:00.000 --> 03:06.400]  processed sugars, and how they can actually take back their justice, their rights, their humanity
[03:06.400 --> 03:12.640]  by turning to nutrition and real foods. And it's a very powerful, inspiring message. And it's coming
[03:12.640 --> 03:20.160]  out of the inner city rap culture. And it's a powerful video that's already gone viral across
[03:20.160 --> 03:25.600]  the internet. So we're gonna cover that here. We've got the creator of that Seasons right here
[03:25.600 --> 03:31.160]  on the show with us today to give us more details on that. This is also part of the resistance,
[03:31.160 --> 03:37.240]  the rising resistance of people who are waking up all across America, across all cultures,
[03:37.240 --> 03:44.080]  across all racial lines. And this individual, Seasons, he is African American. And I think
[03:44.080 --> 03:52.000]  that's very important for us to acknowledge how it's every culture that is waking up against the
[03:52.000 --> 03:58.200]  machine. You see, the system wants us to fight among black and white, Latino. They want us to
[03:58.200 --> 04:02.440]  fight with each other. That's why they engage in so much race baiting. They're trying to create a
[04:02.440 --> 04:09.160]  racial war. What we need to have, folks, is racial unity against the system of fascist corporate
[04:09.160 --> 04:16.120]  control. And this song creator, this artist, Seasons, is doing exactly that. And so that's
[04:16.120 --> 04:21.400]  why we're gonna have him on today to talk about that. It's about the people versus the system,
[04:21.400 --> 04:28.920]  the system of corruption, the system of communist, fascist control. That's what it's really about,
[04:28.920 --> 04:35.560]  people versus oppression, not about black versus white. So anyway, that's coming up.
[04:35.560 --> 04:42.760]  Then we've got more news on how criminals do not have to comply with gun control laws,
[04:42.760 --> 04:45.960]  according to the Supreme Court. That's coming up and much more straight ahead.
[04:45.960 --> 04:55.800]  So stay with us here on The Alex Jones Show. We'll be right back with all that and much more.
[05:46.600 --> 05:59.800]  we're getting prepared. Are you in for Wars shop.com?

[08:49.840 --> 09:14.520]  Alright, it is Friday here on the Alex Jones Show, March 1st, 2013.
[09:14.520 --> 09:18.640]  Thank you for joining us and for the next 3 hours, we're going to be pounding your head
[09:18.640 --> 09:24.240]  with news that will blow your mind, including this one, mind melds of rats.
[09:24.240 --> 09:28.040]  Oh, by the way, well before I get to that, so we've got a couple of guests coming up
[09:28.040 --> 09:34.720]  and in the third hour, we're going to be airing an interview between Alex Jones and what's
[09:34.720 --> 09:38.080]  the rap artist name, guys?
[09:38.080 --> 09:40.080]  Immortal Technique, yeah.
[09:40.080 --> 09:42.200]  Yeah, Immortal Technique.
[09:42.200 --> 09:48.160]  I saw a bit of that of a previous interview that Alex did with him, but he's got, I don't
[09:48.160 --> 09:53.280]  know, a more condensed version, more powerful version coming in the third hour today, so
[09:53.280 --> 09:55.240]  don't miss that.
[09:55.240 --> 10:02.160]  But anyway, we got a lot of breaking news today, including this, mind melds of rats.
[10:02.160 --> 10:05.720]  This is published in the journal Scientific Reports.
[10:05.720 --> 10:11.240]  They've established direct brain to brain communication between rats to have the rats
[10:11.240 --> 10:15.720]  solve problems together that they couldn't do alone.
[10:15.720 --> 10:17.200]  Yeah, right.
[10:17.200 --> 10:21.160]  It takes a village, and now they're going to have brain to brain communication between
[10:21.160 --> 10:25.240]  monkeys that's already being studied, and before long, they're going to have it in humans.
[10:25.240 --> 10:29.720]  It's going to be like the Vulcan mind meld for the globalist agenda.
[10:29.720 --> 10:34.880]  They're probably going to merge, can you imagine if they merged the brain of like Henry Kissinger
[10:34.880 --> 10:36.680]  and Hillary Clinton?
[10:36.680 --> 10:38.280]  What would that be like?
[10:38.280 --> 10:41.840]  What kind of a horror would that create?
[10:41.840 --> 10:49.840]  It would be, or how about the brain of Dianne Feinstein and, who would be a good one to
[10:49.840 --> 10:52.280]  merge Dianne Feinstein with?
[10:52.280 --> 10:59.760]  Dianne Feinstein and, no, how about Obama?
[10:59.760 --> 11:00.760]  There you go.
[11:00.760 --> 11:02.800]  But aren't they pretty much the same brain already?
[11:02.800 --> 11:08.160]  It's all one big brain, they all have the same ideas, they don't have unique thoughts
[11:08.160 --> 11:09.160]  at all.
[11:09.160 --> 11:13.480]  They have a hive mind anyway, running the entire Democratic Party it seems anyway, so
[11:13.480 --> 11:16.560]  I don't know what they're going to accomplish by connecting their brains.
[11:16.560 --> 11:21.480]  But anyway, this is just another example of the crazy science that's going on, and they
[11:21.480 --> 11:25.940]  talk about it how, oh, they're going to help severely paralyzed people, but really that's
[11:25.940 --> 11:30.260]  just a cover story because what they're really going to do is use this technology like they've
[11:30.260 --> 11:34.540]  used every other technology to build an army of robots.
[11:34.540 --> 11:40.760]  An army of armed robots and drones that have weapons that can then attack you, and right
[11:40.760 --> 11:47.200]  now, oh, by the way, that story is, I'm sorry, the drone story is up on Infowars.com right
[11:47.200 --> 11:50.720]  now by Steve Watson, so check that out at Infowars.com.
[11:50.720 --> 11:56.560]  Oh, this is, I'm sorry, this is a story from last year, but it's relevant.
[11:56.560 --> 12:01.420]  We're witnessing the beginning of the industrial revolution of war with artificial intelligence
[12:01.420 --> 12:08.400]  type of brains inside the drones that are now, of course, legally able to assassinate
[12:08.400 --> 12:12.200]  American citizens on US soil.
[12:12.200 --> 12:18.440]  Thanks to that 16-page Department of Justice memo that was recently issued, and Obama has
[12:18.440 --> 12:24.000]  so far refused to say, we will rule out any strikes on US soil.
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.740]  So that's on the map, you got that?
[12:26.740 --> 12:28.440]  America is the battleground.
[12:28.440 --> 12:30.860]  The drones are already out there.
[12:30.860 --> 12:33.360]  The drones have weapons, obviously.
[12:33.360 --> 12:35.920]  They are striking Americans.
[12:35.920 --> 12:40.280]  Obama has his secret kill list where he can kill Americans, and now they're working on
[12:40.280 --> 12:43.800]  the brains of mice and monkeys.
[12:43.800 --> 12:49.080]  I bet you what we're gonna actually see is we're gonna have a flying monkey brain in
[12:49.080 --> 12:50.080]  the drone.
[12:50.080 --> 12:54.080]  It's gonna be like something right out of Wizard of Oz, like flying gargoyle monkey
[12:54.080 --> 13:01.960]  creatures in the Pentagon drone program, and they get a cookie if they hit the target,
[13:01.960 --> 13:04.540]  like little kamikaze monkey brains.
[13:04.540 --> 13:05.540]  That's where this was all heading.
[13:05.540 --> 13:09.240]  I know it sounds crazy, but that's where it's heading, because here's another story from
[13:09.240 --> 13:15.120]  2012 that was also written by Paul Joseph Watson.
[13:15.120 --> 13:19.740]  The new DARPA robot can autonomously track people.
[13:19.740 --> 13:22.880]  And do we have a video clip of that robot?
[13:22.880 --> 13:26.440]  That is the DARPA legged squad support system.
[13:26.440 --> 13:28.360]  That's a scary looking thing.
[13:28.360 --> 13:30.840]  That thing, it chases people through the forest.
[13:30.840 --> 13:35.000]  Yeah, for those of you watching on prisonplant.tv, we're running that video.
[13:35.000 --> 13:42.160]  It's got this Boston Dynamics hydraulic four-legged creature marching through the woods, carrying
[13:42.160 --> 13:46.080]  a payload, and tracking humans.
[13:46.080 --> 13:48.440]  Yeah.
[13:48.440 --> 13:54.000]  And of course, when Alex was here saying, let's say five years ago, that they're gonna
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.120]  build an army of robots to come after you, and they're gonna have an army of drones in
[13:58.120 --> 14:03.680]  the skies firing missiles at American citizens, he was called crazy.
[14:03.680 --> 14:08.560]  No, that can't be, there can't be drones coming after American citizens, there can't be robots.
[14:08.560 --> 14:10.080]  There are no terminators.
[14:10.080 --> 14:16.460]  Well, once again, Alex is owed a massive apology by the establishment, because again, he was
[14:16.460 --> 14:20.280]  ahead of his time in predicting that.
[14:20.280 --> 14:25.480]  You know, I noticed that if you're, let's say, a month ahead in your predictions, you're
[14:25.480 --> 14:27.860]  considered a genius.
[14:27.860 --> 14:32.640]  If you're five years ahead, you're considered a kook.
[14:32.640 --> 14:36.920]  So it's just because the population hasn't caught up yet.
[14:36.920 --> 14:38.980]  So there you go.
[14:38.980 --> 14:42.880]  DARPA enlists makers of big dog robot, which we just showed there, to construct machines
[14:42.880 --> 14:44.400]  that can think for themselves.
[14:44.400 --> 14:50.560]  This is a story by Steve Watson, also from last year, machines that can think for themselves.
[14:50.560 --> 14:57.160]  And of course, it's being pushed as a way to perform evacuation operations.
[14:57.160 --> 15:02.960]  Yeah, they never wanna talk about how they're gonna mount 50 caliber guns on these robots
[15:02.960 --> 15:10.880]  and go after American citizens and civilians living in US cities after they declare martial
[15:10.880 --> 15:13.560]  law following the economic collapse.
[15:13.560 --> 15:19.360]  Wow, they were just showing a video there where you try to kick over the robot, and
[15:19.360 --> 15:21.080]  it recovers and stands up.
[15:21.080 --> 15:22.080]  It stays standing.
[15:22.080 --> 15:23.080]  You can't even kick it over.
[15:23.080 --> 15:27.840]  That thing looks like a giant spider creature.
[15:27.840 --> 15:31.600]  They got walking on water, slippery water, and it's recovering.
[15:31.600 --> 15:32.600]  That is scary, man.
[15:32.600 --> 15:34.280]  That is freaky.
[15:34.280 --> 15:35.280]  That is freaky.
[15:35.280 --> 15:43.280]  But speaking of 50 calibers, by the way, man, my head is still ringing today.
[15:43.280 --> 15:51.460]  Yesterday, Alex invited me to go out shooting with him and Shane Steiner.
[15:51.460 --> 16:01.400]  And we had three Barrett 50 caliber BMGs and two 338 Lapua rifles all lined up.
[16:01.400 --> 16:04.280]  And we decided to shoot this piece of I-beam that I have here in the studio.
[16:04.280 --> 16:07.920]  I don't know if you can give a shot of this I-beam over here.
[16:07.920 --> 16:14.720]  This thing got mangled because somebody brought some armor-piercing ammo with some white,
[16:14.720 --> 16:18.760]  I guess it was some kind of phosphorus coating or something.
[16:18.760 --> 16:19.760]  Can you show this I-beam?
[16:19.760 --> 16:21.160]  Yeah, look at this.
[16:21.160 --> 16:29.480]  So this is a, man, that's at least a three-eighths inch thick piece of metal, probably a lot
[16:29.480 --> 16:30.480]  more.
[16:30.480 --> 16:34.240]  Yeah, it looks like about three-eighths.
[16:34.240 --> 16:35.840]  And it's a big I-beam.
[16:35.840 --> 16:42.760]  And well, here, hang on here, hear that, that's the metal we're talking about.
[16:42.760 --> 16:45.880]  That's what we were shooting at yesterday.
[16:45.880 --> 16:50.260]  And it's still ringing, either that or my head is still ringing, I can't tell.
[16:50.260 --> 16:52.600]  My head was ringing when I woke up this morning, that's for sure.
[16:52.600 --> 16:58.480]  It's got holes, just massive holes blown through it, pieces of metal torn out of it.
[16:58.480 --> 17:01.280]  We must have hit this thing at least 50 times.
[17:01.280 --> 17:08.680]  I'm telling you, I think we shot a couple thousand dollars worth of 50-cal ammo yesterday.
[17:08.680 --> 17:14.080]  And the reason my head is ringing is because we lined up, all three of us, there on the
[17:14.080 --> 17:18.160]  ground about, I don't know, 400, 450 yards away from the target.
[17:18.160 --> 17:23.040]  And I was stupid enough to be the guy in the middle.
[17:23.040 --> 17:24.560]  That's not a...
[17:24.560 --> 17:29.320]  Of all the positions to be in when you're firing three 50-cals, being in the middle
[17:29.320 --> 17:32.020]  is the worst position of all.
[17:32.020 --> 17:36.280]  It's sort of like being attacked by concussion grenades on all sides.
[17:36.280 --> 17:42.760]  And so I would get blasted by Shane's rifle, and then I get blasted by Alex's rifle, and
[17:42.760 --> 17:47.480]  Alex, of course, was engaged in rapid fire, boom, boom, boom, and then I would fire off
[17:47.480 --> 17:51.760]  a shot of my own, and then all the grass and dust would blow up in my face.
[17:51.760 --> 17:56.240]  Before I could recover, Alex was blasting off another couple of rounds, and I was sucking
[17:56.240 --> 17:59.400]  in all this grass off the ground.
[17:59.400 --> 18:00.400]  They were elevated.
[18:00.400 --> 18:05.940]  Alex and Shane were in elevated trucks, firing, and I was on the ground, because I'd brought
[18:05.940 --> 18:13.200]  a shooting mat, so I was on the ground, and I must have inhaled so much grass, just ranch
[18:13.200 --> 18:14.920]  grass and dust.
[18:14.920 --> 18:19.460]  This is why you might even hear it in my voice today, it's a little rough, and then Jacobson
[18:19.460 --> 18:25.240]  was spotting, and we blasted the crap out of this I-beam.
[18:25.240 --> 18:32.560]  And I guess it looked like a military helicopter took some interest in this and was sort of
[18:32.560 --> 18:33.560]  checking us out.
[18:33.560 --> 18:34.560]  What's going on?
[18:34.560 --> 18:36.840]  And they may have seen some of the tracer rounds, too.
[18:36.840 --> 18:42.120]  It was quite a show, and anyway, we got it all on video, and Jacobson is gonna be editing
[18:42.120 --> 18:45.280]  that over the next few weeks, so you'll get to see that.
[18:45.280 --> 18:52.800]  That is three.50 cals and a couple of.338 Lapuas blasting away here in Central Texas.
[18:52.800 --> 18:59.800]  And I gotta say, the more the system talks about gun control, the bigger guns we want,
[18:59.800 --> 19:04.280]  the more guns we buy, the more ammo we buy, and the more we shoot.
[19:04.280 --> 19:10.440]  If people like Obama and Feinstein and Biden really wanted us to stop buying guns, they
[19:10.440 --> 19:13.140]  should stop talking about gun control.
[19:13.140 --> 19:14.580]  It's real simple.
[19:14.580 --> 19:19.540]  Every time you talk about gun control, I get a little itchy trigger finger, and I wanna
[19:19.540 --> 19:23.560]  go out and shoot somebody's.50 cal Barrett.
[19:23.560 --> 19:28.920]  And it's the same with everybody, all the patriots, everybody who loves firearms and
[19:28.920 --> 19:31.880]  loves sport shooting, they feel the same way.
[19:31.880 --> 19:36.920]  They wanna go out, get on the trigger, get some trigger time, throw some lead downrange
[19:36.920 --> 19:40.560]  and blast away some I-beam like we did here.
[19:40.560 --> 19:41.880]  It was pretty wild.
[19:41.880 --> 19:46.800]  So hey, as long as they keep talking about gun control, we're gonna keep upsizing our
[19:46.800 --> 19:50.080]  weapons and our ammo, and putting it on film for you.
[19:50.080 --> 19:51.080]  So stay with us.
[19:51.080 --> 19:54.160]  We'll be right back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[19:54.160 --> 20:06.980]  Hello, I'm Alex Jones, myself, my family, the Infowars.com team want to relay to you
[20:06.980 --> 20:12.240]  and your families that we are intensifying our efforts against the globalist on every
[20:12.240 --> 20:13.240]  front.
[20:13.240 --> 20:18.980]  Infowars.com is leading the fight against the technocrats, but we can't do that without
[20:18.980 --> 20:19.980]  your help.
[20:19.980 --> 20:25.220]  By getting the films, bumper stickers and t-shirts at Infowars.com, you will wake up
[20:25.220 --> 20:31.240]  people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[20:31.240 --> 20:34.700]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[20:34.700 --> 20:40.920]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[20:40.920 --> 20:48.400]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[20:48.400 --> 20:49.960]  and ultimate extermination.
[20:49.960 --> 20:52.280]  The war is here.
[20:52.280 --> 20:54.160]  It's an Infowar.
[20:54.160 --> 21:00.520]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[21:00.520 --> 21:01.740]  My name is Stephen Heuer.
[21:01.740 --> 21:05.640]  After 22 years of nutritional counseling, I've observed that most brain malfunctions
[21:05.640 --> 21:08.960]  have at their roots some form of toxicity and brain damage.
[21:08.960 --> 21:12.840]  So whether it is poor memory, poor focus, lack of creative thinking, or more serious
[21:12.840 --> 21:17.360]  matters like inability to focus, speak normally, or remember things, the emphasis to getting
[21:17.360 --> 21:21.020]  one's brain working optimally needs to be on detoxification.
[21:21.020 --> 21:25.400]  One World Way supports your body's number one means of detoxification, which is glutathione
[21:25.400 --> 21:26.400]  production.
[21:26.400 --> 21:30.520]  My name is Angie, and my son has suffered from borderline autism and constipation.
[21:30.520 --> 21:35.160]  I got him on One World Way, and in two months, his constipation is gone.
[21:35.160 --> 21:36.160]  He's become friendlier.
[21:36.160 --> 21:40.840]  He can carry on a normal conversation with me, and he has made his first friend.
[21:40.840 --> 21:44.400]  He's doing great, and he looks forward to taking One World Way every day.
[21:44.400 --> 21:49.360]  You could offer him a present or a cake, and he would prefer the One World Way.
[21:49.360 --> 21:51.640]  Go to oneworldway.com.
[21:51.640 --> 21:57.320]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y, dot com, or call 888-988-3325.
[21:57.320 --> 22:00.320]  That's 888-988-3325.
[22:00.320 --> 22:04.720]  Now there's an amazing new natural antibiotic every person must have.
[22:04.720 --> 22:10.640]  It's cells-alive silver solution, and it destroys over 650 hard-to-kill viruses, fungus, bacteria,
[22:10.640 --> 22:11.640]  and much more.

[22:16.320 --> 22:19.280]  shelters, and comes in 8- or 16-ounce bottles.

[22:29.840 --> 22:34.040]  We the people grow cotton, we fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from
[22:34.040 --> 22:38.280]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes
[22:38.280 --> 22:39.280]  to service debt.
[22:39.280 --> 22:42.800]  This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[22:42.800 --> 22:46.120]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[22:46.120 --> 22:47.120]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[22:47.120 --> 22:50.360]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[23:59.800 --> 24:16.280]  All right, we're back.
[24:16.280 --> 24:27.120]  Thanks for joining us.
[24:27.120 --> 24:29.840]  This is Mike Adams filling in today for Alex Jones.
[24:29.840 --> 24:30.840]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[24:30.840 --> 24:33.240]  Yes, you're in the right place.
[24:33.240 --> 24:38.320]  And yes, as I was explaining before the break, my head is still ringing from going shooting
[24:38.320 --> 24:45.320]  with Alex yesterday with 350 cal BMG rifles, all Barrett's.
[24:45.320 --> 24:49.680]  Two of them were the M107A1 rifles, the brand new.
[24:49.680 --> 24:56.280]  I think there must be more 50 cals in Texas than anywhere in the country, and Texans sure
[24:56.280 --> 24:57.280]  know how to use them.
[24:57.280 --> 25:02.360]  But anyway, speaking of knowing how to use firearms, oh, and by the way, we have a really
[25:02.360 --> 25:09.160]  exciting guest coming up in the next few minutes, Joe Dixon from Morningland Dairy, about the
[25:09.160 --> 25:13.580]  continued scourge of oppression of food freedom in America.
[25:13.580 --> 25:15.340]  So that's coming up shortly.
[25:15.340 --> 25:26.640]  But remember when Joe Biden was asked by that reporter, that journalist, about should women
[25:26.640 --> 25:28.600]  use guns to defend themselves?
[25:28.600 --> 25:31.840]  And Joe Biden said, get a shotgun, get a shotgun.
[25:31.840 --> 25:34.720]  You don't need an AR-15, get a shotgun.
[25:34.720 --> 25:40.960]  Well, it turns out that shotguns kick a whole lot worse than an AR-15.
[25:40.960 --> 25:46.960]  And there's a lot of, let's say, smaller frame women who have trouble with shooting 12 gauge
[25:46.960 --> 25:50.240]  slugs or steel shot or what have you.
[25:50.240 --> 25:54.760]  And just to prove this point, not to make fun of women, but just to prove this point
[25:54.760 --> 25:59.240]  that Joe Biden has no idea what he's talking about, someone out there put together a really
[25:59.240 --> 26:03.320]  interesting video, a YouTube video, that we're gonna play right now.
[26:03.320 --> 26:07.320]  So I'm gonna narrate it for radio listeners, but take a look, go ahead and roll that.
[26:07.320 --> 26:13.120]  She's asking if a ban goes into effect on certain kinds of weapons and high capacity
[26:13.120 --> 26:14.120]  magazines.
[26:14.120 --> 26:15.120]  And what's your name?
[26:15.120 --> 26:16.120]  Kate.
[26:16.120 --> 26:22.240]  Kate, if you want to protect yourself, get a double barrel shotgun, have the shells of
[26:22.240 --> 26:24.080]  12 gauge shotgun.
[26:24.080 --> 26:30.400]  And I promise you, as I told my wife, we live in an area that's wooded and somewhat secluded.
[26:30.400 --> 26:35.880]  I said, Jill, if there's ever a problem, just walk out on the balcony here or walk out,
[26:35.880 --> 26:39.920]  put that double barrel shotgun and fire two blasts.
[26:39.920 --> 26:46.860]  Here's women shooting the shotgun and blowing themselves over and smacking themselves in
[26:46.860 --> 26:50.320]  the faces with the shotguns.
[26:50.320 --> 26:51.560]  Ouch.
[26:51.560 --> 26:55.360]  That looked like it hurt.
[26:55.360 --> 27:00.160]  Oh, man, that's gonna burn.
[27:00.160 --> 27:02.200]  And I feel that one.
[27:02.200 --> 27:05.360]  You'll be completely fine.
[27:05.360 --> 27:06.360]  Here's another.
[27:06.360 --> 27:15.560]  Oh, it's like a 75 pound girl shooting a shotgun, looked like a Sega 12.
[27:15.560 --> 27:16.880]  They're not having much success.
[27:16.880 --> 27:24.000]  Oh, wow, a multi-fire fail right there.
[27:24.000 --> 27:31.680]  So these women are having a lot of trouble with these 12 gauge shotguns.
[27:31.680 --> 27:36.520]  I promise you, who's ever coming in is not gonna, you don't need an AR-15.
[27:36.520 --> 27:38.040]  It's harder to aim.
[27:38.040 --> 27:39.720]  It's harder to use.
[27:39.720 --> 27:44.480]  So now here's a woman firing an AR-15 with good accuracy.
[27:44.480 --> 27:47.080]  Boom, boom, boom.
[27:47.080 --> 27:50.680]  Multi shots, full control.
[27:50.680 --> 27:54.720]  And in fact, you don't need 30 rounds to protect yourself.
[27:54.720 --> 27:56.880]  Buy a shotgun.
[27:56.880 --> 28:01.040]  Buy a shotgun.
[28:01.040 --> 28:04.320]  And there's a guy with a blasted shotgun and his pants fall down.
[28:04.320 --> 28:08.320]  Oh, that's more than we wanted to see right there.
[28:08.320 --> 28:12.640]  The crew was joking that he needs a flash suppressor.
[28:12.640 --> 28:14.120]  His pants fell down.
[28:14.120 --> 28:20.320]  Anyway, the point is, the point is, Joe Biden, you need to learn the laws of physics.
[28:20.320 --> 28:27.400]  In fact, Newtonian laws of motion, for every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction.
[28:27.400 --> 28:31.640]  If you're gonna push a lot of lead out the front of a shotgun, it's gonna kick.
[28:31.640 --> 28:35.040]  And it turns out that a shotgun kicks way more than an AR-15.
[28:35.040 --> 28:41.960]  Even a 95-pound light-framed woman can handle an AR-15 much easier than shooting a 12 gauge
[28:41.960 --> 28:44.480]  shotgun with most loads.
[28:44.480 --> 28:47.700]  So hey, I'm sorry to break it to you, but that's reality.
[28:47.700 --> 28:49.400]  That's physics.
[28:49.400 --> 28:53.480]  I love how these people in Washington like to just make up their own laws of physics
[28:53.480 --> 28:56.440]  or laws of economics.
[28:56.440 --> 28:59.200]  If we raise taxes, we're gonna get more tax revenue.
[28:59.200 --> 29:02.120]  No, you're not, cuz everybody's gonna go out of business.
[29:02.120 --> 29:03.840]  Businesses are gonna stop hiring.
[29:03.840 --> 29:04.840]  Or how about this one?
[29:04.840 --> 29:09.160]  If we take more money from people's paychecks, that's good for the economy.
[29:09.160 --> 29:10.440]  No, it isn't.
[29:10.440 --> 29:11.440]  Guess what?
[29:11.440 --> 29:17.320]  On the top of DrudgeReport.com right now, the take-home income in America has dropped
[29:17.320 --> 29:20.280]  the most since 1959.
[29:20.280 --> 29:25.200]  That means the discretionary income that people have to buy things at places like Walmart
[29:25.200 --> 29:30.440]  continues to plummet, which is why Walmart is having a disastrous month here.
[29:30.440 --> 29:35.440]  Well, February was a disastrous month, and March will probably be again in 2013.
[29:35.440 --> 29:40.480]  And it's gonna get even worse for Walmart and the economy as the government takes more
[29:40.480 --> 29:41.480]  taxes.
[29:41.480 --> 29:42.760]  Anyway, stay with us straight ahead.
[29:42.760 --> 29:47.880]  We've got an interview with Morningland Dairy founder Joe Dixon coming right up.
[29:47.880 --> 29:49.940]  We'll be right back with that.
[29:49.940 --> 29:51.220]  We're on the march.
[29:51.220 --> 29:53.600]  The empire's on the run.
[29:53.600 --> 30:01.040]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:01.040 --> 30:02.520]  Your freedoms are on the line.
[30:02.520 --> 30:04.360]  The Second Amendment is in danger.
[30:04.360 --> 30:06.740]  How soon before your freedoms are taken away?
[30:06.740 --> 30:08.440]  What can you not live without?
[30:08.440 --> 30:10.080]  What is your greatest dependency?
[30:10.080 --> 30:11.080]  Is it your guns?
[30:11.080 --> 30:12.080]  Is it your home?
[30:12.080 --> 30:13.440]  No, it's food.
[30:13.440 --> 30:15.560]  It all boils down to the food supply.
[30:15.560 --> 30:19.280]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[30:19.280 --> 30:20.280]  Don't be dependent.
[30:20.280 --> 30:21.560]  Be self-sufficient.
[30:21.560 --> 30:23.160]  Don't wait for the government to feed you.
[30:23.160 --> 30:24.160]  Feed yourself.
[30:24.160 --> 30:26.400]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[30:26.400 --> 30:29.960]  Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from eFoods Direct.
[30:29.960 --> 30:32.760]  It's the best long-term, storable food on the planet.

[31:00.680 --> 31:01.840]  I had tried everything.
[31:01.840 --> 31:04.160]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[31:04.160 --> 31:07.380]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[31:07.380 --> 31:11.760]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[31:11.760 --> 31:17.740]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and
[31:17.740 --> 31:18.740]  be satisfied.
[31:18.740 --> 31:23.080]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at InfowarsTeam.com, but I want to point out
[31:23.080 --> 31:30.680]  the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[31:30.680 --> 31:34.280]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst and Rebound.
[31:34.280 --> 31:38.600]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more
[31:38.600 --> 31:41.040]  than 37 pounds in just two months.
[31:41.040 --> 31:42.480]  Now that's results.

[33:03.960 --> 33:09.640]  I like to share a revelation that I've had during my time here.
[33:09.640 --> 33:16.640]  When it came to me when I tried to classify your species, I realized that you're not
[33:16.640 --> 33:19.640]  actually mammals.
[33:19.640 --> 33:26.400]  Every mammal on this planet instinctively develops a natural equilibrium with the surrounding
[33:26.400 --> 33:29.840]  environment, but you humans do not.
[33:29.840 --> 33:38.560]  You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed.
[33:38.560 --> 33:49.240]  The only way you can survive is to spread to another area.
[33:49.240 --> 33:53.800]  There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern.
[33:53.800 --> 33:57.040]  Do you know what it is?
[33:57.040 --> 34:00.320]  A virus.
[34:00.320 --> 34:05.360]  Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet.
[34:05.360 --> 34:08.360]  You are a plague.
[34:08.360 --> 34:15.720]  You are the cure.
[34:15.720 --> 34:19.880]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God.
[34:19.880 --> 34:22.080]  It's Alex Jones.
[34:22.080 --> 34:27.080]  All right, welcome back, friends.
[34:27.080 --> 34:30.000]  This is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, filling in for Alex today.
[34:30.000 --> 34:31.400]  Yeah, my voice is a little rough.
[34:31.400 --> 34:36.860]  I was sucking in all this dust and grass when we went shooting yesterday, and it has literally
[34:36.860 --> 34:37.860]  affected me.
[34:37.860 --> 34:44.520]  You know, the other thing is that we had a truck out there that had a big steel dump
[34:44.520 --> 34:47.760]  bed that we use as a shooting platform.
[34:47.760 --> 34:52.400]  And every time you shoot out of that bed, it's like being in a giant bell, and it just
[34:52.400 --> 34:53.640]  would ring that bell.
[34:53.640 --> 34:57.180]  The whole bed would reverberate, and it would vibrate through your whole body.
[34:57.180 --> 35:01.780]  And I swear, when I woke up this morning, my head was still ringing from that.
[35:01.780 --> 35:06.240]  It is a massive concussion, enough on that.
[35:06.240 --> 35:10.520]  But okay, so we've got Joe Dixon joining us here in just a minute.
[35:10.520 --> 35:13.560]  Wanna get a couple notes in there before then.
[35:13.560 --> 35:18.320]  Tonight on the Nightly News, we're gonna be covering the fact that the, according to the
[35:18.320 --> 35:25.600]  US Supreme Court, criminals do not have to comply with any gun registration legislation.
[35:25.600 --> 35:28.400]  So it's not just that they won't comply.
[35:28.400 --> 35:29.400]  We already know that.
[35:29.400 --> 35:36.560]  But legally, they are in effect restricted from complying due to the Fifth Amendment
[35:36.560 --> 35:42.200]  and the fact that you are protected from self-incrimination under the US Constitution.
[35:42.200 --> 35:47.120]  So the US Supreme Court has ruled in the past, and we're gonna discuss this tonight with
[35:47.120 --> 35:48.120]  Jim Mars.
[35:48.120 --> 35:51.460]  It's just one of the many topics we'll be discussing.
[35:51.460 --> 35:57.020]  Our focus is raw milk and food freedom, but we're gonna cover this as well, that criminals
[35:57.020 --> 36:00.960]  do not have to comply, in fact, are restricted from complying.
[36:00.960 --> 36:07.100]  So if they pass a gun registration law or a gun confiscation law, by law, only law-abiding
[36:07.100 --> 36:12.700]  citizens must comply with those restrictions, which, of course, is the complete opposite
[36:12.700 --> 36:14.240]  of what you want.
[36:14.240 --> 36:17.940]  You don't need to register honest, ethical citizens who have firearms.
[36:17.940 --> 36:23.680]  What you wanna do, in essence, is find the criminals who might be robbing a bank or committing
[36:23.680 --> 36:24.780]  some crime with it.
[36:24.780 --> 36:28.320]  So those are exactly the people that are exempt, according to the US Supreme Court.
[36:28.320 --> 36:32.600]  So we'll be covering that tonight in the Infowars Nightly News and some other news as well.
[36:32.600 --> 36:38.440]  We're gonna have a commercial, a parody commercial for Obama Bites, the multivitamin made in
[36:38.440 --> 36:45.180]  China that contains miraculous, amazing minerals like obamnesium, which causes you to forget
[36:45.180 --> 36:47.000]  American history.
[36:47.000 --> 36:50.520]  All the way back to 1776, it's a very powerful nutrient.
[36:50.520 --> 36:55.800]  It's also got fucusimium for extracellular energy, and squeezium to help the TSA do their
[36:55.800 --> 36:56.800]  jobs better.
[36:56.800 --> 37:01.200]  Cuz, you know, you can never have enough squeezium when you're going through security at the
[37:01.200 --> 37:02.960]  airport, right?
[37:02.960 --> 37:04.600]  Yeah, nice.
[37:04.600 --> 37:11.220]  Okay, let's turn to Food Freedom and Joe Dixon with Morningland Dairy out of Missouri.
[37:11.220 --> 37:12.800]  And he joins us now by phone.
[37:12.800 --> 37:15.640]  And let me set this up here.
[37:15.640 --> 37:18.760]  Joe is gonna give us the breakdown of what happened there in Morningland Dairy.
[37:18.760 --> 37:23.200]  And I gotta apologize to Joe, I tried to connect with him before and we had some storms.
[37:23.200 --> 37:24.700]  And I couldn't get that interview done.
[37:24.700 --> 37:30.600]  So I wanted to invite him here today to tell his story to you, the Infowars listeners,
[37:30.600 --> 37:33.580]  so that you know this is still going on in America.
[37:33.580 --> 37:39.040]  The government is still oppressing food freedoms and food rights and going after farmers.
[37:39.040 --> 37:41.200]  And here to tell us that story is Joe Dixon.
[37:41.200 --> 37:45.560]  Joe, thank you for joining us live today on the Alex Jones Show.
[37:45.560 --> 37:47.040]  Very much appreciate you having me on, Mike.
[37:47.040 --> 37:50.680]  First off, I'd like to say I do appreciate your humor.
[37:50.680 --> 37:53.760]  Well, you might be the only one.
[37:53.760 --> 37:54.960]  But thank you for that note.
[37:54.960 --> 37:57.600]  Now, people like a little bit of, we gotta lighten it up.
[37:57.600 --> 37:59.240]  It's so crazy out there.
[37:59.240 --> 38:04.480]  Yes, we can face reality when the people who are trying to oppress us have a very hard
[38:04.480 --> 38:06.680]  time facing reality.
[38:06.680 --> 38:07.680]  That's true.
[38:07.680 --> 38:10.000]  And also those oppressors, they hate to be made fun of.
[38:10.000 --> 38:11.000]  They just hate it.
[38:11.000 --> 38:12.320]  Yes, they do.
[38:12.320 --> 38:18.240]  So I just say, let's feed them some extra squeezium and let them feel each other up
[38:18.240 --> 38:19.240]  there at the airport.
[38:19.240 --> 38:21.040]  What do they do when there's no passengers in line?
[38:21.040 --> 38:22.920]  Do they check each other?
[38:22.920 --> 38:25.080]  That's a good question.
[38:25.080 --> 38:28.480]  Yeah, I bet that's what those curtains are for.
[38:28.480 --> 38:29.480]  Yeah.
[38:29.480 --> 38:32.200]  Yeah, they're calibrating the machines.
[38:32.200 --> 38:34.920]  They're calibrating the x-ray machines is what they're gonna say.
[38:34.920 --> 38:36.280]  Yeah, actually, right.
[38:36.280 --> 38:37.280]  That's it.
[38:37.280 --> 38:38.280]  Anyway, sorry, Joe.
[38:38.280 --> 38:39.280]  I don't mean to get off track.
[38:39.280 --> 38:40.280]  Go ahead.
[38:40.280 --> 38:41.280]  Tell us about yourself.
[38:41.280 --> 38:43.240]  Well, my name is Joseph Dixon of Morningland Dairy.
[38:43.240 --> 38:45.680]  I go by Joe most of the time.
[38:45.680 --> 38:51.120]  And my wife and I have been fighting a battle with the state of Missouri, the FDA, the Attorney
[38:51.120 --> 38:57.160]  General's Office, now apparently appearing to be in appearance as part of the state of
[38:57.160 --> 39:05.000]  California over our abilities to have raw milk cheese, to have a product that we consider
[39:05.000 --> 39:12.080]  to be very healthy, that has actual enzymes, bacterias, nutrients in it that your body
[39:12.080 --> 39:16.040]  can digest since we are a part of the living organisms of this planet.
[39:16.040 --> 39:17.040]  Yeah.
[39:17.040 --> 39:18.040]  Yeah.
[39:18.040 --> 39:20.040]  Raw dairy is more digestible than processed pasteurized dairy.
[39:20.040 --> 39:21.040]  Yes.
[39:21.040 --> 39:25.900]  But there's a battle going on to stop anything that is raw milk from the federal government
[39:25.900 --> 39:26.900]  on down.
[39:26.900 --> 39:33.560]  The reason for that is, is because, in my opinion, the government doesn't want anything
[39:33.560 --> 39:34.560]  that's healthy for us.
[39:34.560 --> 39:39.640]  I think that's why I appreciated your humor when you first came on, because of what you
[39:39.640 --> 39:40.960]  were saying there.
[39:40.960 --> 39:44.600]  But anyway, we had an embargo letter put on our door.
[39:44.600 --> 39:47.960]  First off, our case started with Rawson Foods in California.
[39:47.960 --> 39:52.960]  Some of our cheese was confiscated in the raid in Rawson Foods of California.
[39:52.960 --> 39:55.160]  I think you've had their case on there before.
[39:55.160 --> 39:56.160]  Yeah.
[39:56.160 --> 40:01.600]  But just to give people a brief, that was armed agents, both state, county, and federally
[40:01.600 --> 40:05.840]  funded armed raid on James Stewart and Rawson Foods in California.
[40:05.840 --> 40:10.560]  They confiscated over $50,000 worth of food and destroyed it, and took all of James Stewart's
[40:10.560 --> 40:15.560]  money and threw him in jail, and two different counties then prosecuted him for multiple
[40:15.560 --> 40:18.560]  felony crimes.
[40:18.560 --> 40:21.120]  So I'm just giving the background for people who may not know.
[40:21.120 --> 40:23.640]  That's very much appreciated, but they need to know where it all started from.
[40:23.640 --> 40:24.640]  Yeah.
[40:24.640 --> 40:25.640]  Okay, go ahead.
[40:25.640 --> 40:31.760]  Fifty-five days later, the state of Missouri and the FDA, in some form or another, got
[40:31.760 --> 40:36.680]  information from the state of California that we may have had a possible contamination of
[40:36.680 --> 40:38.680]  Listeria Baphoeus in our cheese.
[40:38.680 --> 40:42.520]  Notice they said 55 days later.
[40:42.520 --> 40:47.200]  We wonder where that cheese was for 55 days, whose hands and how it was handled for 55
[40:47.200 --> 40:48.200]  days.
[40:48.200 --> 40:53.560]  Well, yeah, they probably stored it in a hot warehouse somewhere just to make sure it had
[40:53.560 --> 40:54.560]  Listeria.
[40:54.560 --> 40:55.840]  Well, we don't know.
[40:55.840 --> 41:01.920]  Also, what's very interesting, as we go through the invoices of where we sold cheese to James
[41:01.920 --> 41:07.880]  Stewart for Rawson Foods, the FDA listed that they picked up one-pound packages of cheese.
[41:07.880 --> 41:11.880]  The only cheese we ever sold to Rawson was half-pounds or less.
[41:11.880 --> 41:12.880]  Interesting.
[41:12.880 --> 41:18.480]  So was there actually a raid conducted on your farm, or how did they oppress you exactly?
[41:18.480 --> 41:25.640]  No, since we were licensed and inspected and everything as they want you to be.
[41:25.640 --> 41:30.040]  They came in forceful but polite, if you want to use that term.
[41:30.040 --> 41:31.880]  Yeah, polite with the guns.
[41:31.880 --> 41:32.880]  Yeah.
[41:32.880 --> 41:33.880]  Well, there were no guns.
[41:33.880 --> 41:34.880]  Oh, okay.
[41:34.880 --> 41:35.880]  They did that.
[41:35.880 --> 41:36.880]  As I was saying, they came in forceful but polite.
[41:36.880 --> 41:41.880]  They came in letting us know exactly what they were going to do.
[41:41.880 --> 41:42.880]  Okay?
[41:42.880 --> 41:46.320]  Now, they put an embargo letter on our door, our cheese house door, where our cheese is
[41:46.320 --> 41:50.800]  stored, and to the day of which they destroyed it, we were not allowed to take anything out
[41:50.800 --> 41:55.720]  of that cooler to the day of which they destroyed it, which was almost two and a half years
[41:55.720 --> 41:56.720]  later.
[41:56.720 --> 42:02.040]  Now, had you ever had anybody get violently sick from eating any of your products ever?
[42:02.040 --> 42:03.040]  No.
[42:03.040 --> 42:08.800]  No, not one complaint in 30 years of being in business as Morningland Dairy, no.
[42:08.800 --> 42:13.640]  And did the FDA care about that history, or did they take that into account?
[42:13.640 --> 42:19.160]  No, because we have a timeline on our site that the State Billboards sent to some of
[42:19.160 --> 42:20.160]  the representatives in Jefferson.
[42:20.160 --> 42:23.120]  Give us your website so we can bring that up.
[42:23.120 --> 42:24.120]  Morninglanddairy.com.
[42:24.120 --> 42:25.120]  Morninglanddairy.com.
[42:25.120 --> 42:26.120]  Yeah.
[42:26.120 --> 42:27.120]  Okay.
[42:27.120 --> 42:33.120]  My wife's been very busy because this has hit her very hard, so it's not up to speed
[42:33.120 --> 42:38.120]  as good as it could be, but we appreciate that people would look and see because we're
[42:38.120 --> 42:41.920]  still fighting because now it's to the point we can ask the question.
[42:41.920 --> 42:46.720]  When you go to court, when you start asking the question of the milk board in the state,
[42:46.720 --> 42:51.560]  we were told that these people have the right of kings in the United States of America.
[42:51.560 --> 42:56.840]  And I thought that's what the revolutionary war with England was fought over, as you pointed
[42:56.840 --> 43:01.440]  out in some of the commercials there, we've lost our history.
[43:01.440 --> 43:05.240]  When you say that they functioned as if they had the right of kings, are you saying that
[43:05.240 --> 43:09.140]  they just felt like they ruled over you, they owned you, and they could control everything
[43:09.140 --> 43:10.320]  that you did on your farm?
[43:10.320 --> 43:11.320]  Is that-
[43:11.320 --> 43:14.960]  No, we were told by our lawyers they have sovereignty of unity.
[43:14.960 --> 43:15.960]  Wow.
[43:15.960 --> 43:16.960]  Right.
[43:16.960 --> 43:17.960]  Right.
[43:17.960 --> 43:18.960]  Now, think about that.
[43:18.960 --> 43:21.160]  So anything they say, it's going to go.
[43:21.160 --> 43:26.320]  Now, but they have regulations they are supposed to go by, okay?
[43:26.320 --> 43:31.080]  And what we ran into was, it finally got to the point, how much time do we have, Mike?
[43:31.080 --> 43:33.080]  No, we have plenty of time.
[43:33.080 --> 43:34.080]  Keep going.
[43:34.080 --> 43:35.080]  Okay.
[43:35.080 --> 43:40.320]  It came about that finally it got to the point, we finally asked Don Falls of the state milk
[43:40.320 --> 43:46.520]  export, Don, if we tested this block of cheese up to a hundred times, our plant manager,
[43:46.520 --> 43:51.000]  Jill Dyer did, if we test this block of cheese up to a hundred times now, this block of cheese
[43:51.000 --> 43:56.280]  is 40 plus or minus pounds, okay, up to a hundred times, and it came back clean every
[43:56.280 --> 43:58.760]  time, would we be permitted to sell this block of cheese?
[43:58.760 --> 43:59.760]  We would, wouldn't we?
[43:59.760 --> 44:00.760]  He said, absolutely not.
[44:00.760 --> 44:01.760]  It would all be suspect.
[44:01.760 --> 44:08.920]  So at that point, I looked at him, I said, okay, in other words, you're telling me then,
[44:08.920 --> 44:12.040]  you don't trust your own regulation.
[44:12.040 --> 44:17.080]  You don't trust your own methods of testing because if you think about it, a 40 pound
[44:17.080 --> 44:20.640]  block, if you test it up to a hundred times, first off, there'd be a little, very little
[44:20.640 --> 44:27.200]  of the cheese left potentially, and how can you justify that?
[44:27.200 --> 44:30.920]  But Joe, you got to, you got to realize, and I know you know this, that it's not about
[44:30.920 --> 44:31.920]  the science.
[44:31.920 --> 44:33.160]  It's not about food science.
[44:33.160 --> 44:34.980]  It's not about the testing results.
[44:34.980 --> 44:40.880]  This is a political war to go after raw milk, dairy, raw cheese producers.
[44:40.880 --> 44:43.320]  It's not, the numbers don't matter.
[44:43.320 --> 44:44.320]  Yes.
[44:44.320 --> 44:48.440]  If the audience will, I don't know, Mike, if you could get a hold of it or not, but
[44:48.440 --> 44:52.400]  also proves the people that bought from them actually signed a paper saying they wanted
[44:52.400 --> 45:00.080]  trace, trace elements of, or trace bacteria in there so that they could build their immune
[45:00.080 --> 45:01.080]  system.
[45:01.080 --> 45:03.360]  That's how our immune systems are built on this earth.
[45:03.360 --> 45:04.360]  I agree.
[45:04.360 --> 45:05.600]  It's sterilized food, really.
[45:05.600 --> 45:09.080]  We actually want a little bit of probiotic in there.
[45:09.080 --> 45:10.080]  Yeah.
[45:10.080 --> 45:11.080]  Yes.
[45:11.080 --> 45:17.400]  With the good farming practices we have today, and I put that in quotation marks, our land
[45:17.400 --> 45:19.120]  has become what, Mike?
[45:19.120 --> 45:20.680]  It's become sterile.
[45:20.680 --> 45:21.680]  Yes.
[45:21.680 --> 45:25.260]  Well, and the FDA says the only safe food is sterilized food.
[45:25.260 --> 45:30.840]  The almond producers in California a couple of years ago had to start fumigating or irradiating
[45:30.840 --> 45:34.960]  their almonds because raw almonds were outlawed by the state board in California.
[45:34.960 --> 45:35.960]  Yes.
[45:35.960 --> 45:39.160]  And that's where most of the almonds come from in the U.S., and the same is true with
[45:39.160 --> 45:40.160]  milk.
[45:40.160 --> 45:41.160]  Yes.
[45:41.160 --> 45:45.880]  And folks, we are not, our bodies, as far as what we contain in our bodies, are not
[45:45.880 --> 45:46.880]  sterile.
[45:46.880 --> 45:49.920]  If our bodies were sterile, we would be dead.
[45:49.920 --> 45:54.960]  Well, in fact, there are more non-human cells in your body than there are human cells.
[45:54.960 --> 45:56.880]  That's how much bacteria is living in your body.
[45:56.880 --> 46:00.600]  And we need that bacteria to stay alive and to be healthy.
[46:00.600 --> 46:01.600]  That's right.
[46:01.600 --> 46:05.560]  Now, if it gets out of balance, yes, then you have diseases, you have other problems.
[46:05.560 --> 46:11.560]  But with our food supply being changed so much, we're running into that very problem
[46:11.560 --> 46:12.560]  now.
[46:12.560 --> 46:17.440]  Our food supply doesn't supply the nutrients we need in order for our bodies to maintain
[46:17.440 --> 46:18.440]  the health.
[46:18.440 --> 46:22.000]  So if you don't mind me saying, we're coming upon the plagues of Egypt now, all upon the
[46:22.000 --> 46:23.000]  United States of America.
[46:23.000 --> 46:24.000]  Yes.
[46:24.000 --> 46:28.600]  Through disease, epidemics, cancer, diabetes, heart disease, Alzheimer's, osteoporosis,
[46:28.600 --> 46:30.120]  mental disorders, you name it.
[46:30.120 --> 46:31.120]  Correct.
[46:31.120 --> 46:35.120]  Now, anyway, so we have been fighting this battle.
[46:35.120 --> 46:39.880]  We're now asking your audience there to help more and more to turn it into a political
[46:39.880 --> 46:41.800]  battle toward our food rights.
[46:41.800 --> 46:42.800]  Yes.
[46:42.800 --> 46:43.800]  To get them back.
[46:43.800 --> 46:49.960]  And what's very interesting, under oath in court, the State Milk Board and a USDA agent
[46:49.960 --> 46:53.080]  and others said that our cheese was so bad.
[46:53.080 --> 46:55.760]  Father King said they said it under oath in court.
[46:55.760 --> 46:57.320]  I know they said it here at the cheese plant.
[46:57.320 --> 47:00.240]  I was a potential witness, but I couldn't listen to all the testimony.
[47:00.240 --> 47:04.400]  But they said here at the cheese plant, and you can read the timeline on our side of the
[47:04.400 --> 47:10.000]  State Milk Board, where as of September the 9th, now remember, this started on August
[47:10.000 --> 47:13.400]  the 26th of 2010.
[47:13.400 --> 47:19.120]  By September the 9th of 2010, they had already decided without one sickness, one illness,
[47:19.120 --> 47:24.000]  nothing, and without any proper testing of our cheese, any state or federal proper testing
[47:24.000 --> 47:30.800]  of our cheese at all, they had already decided that our cheese was not fit for animal consumption.
[47:30.800 --> 47:32.560]  So you couldn't even sell it as animal feed.
[47:32.560 --> 47:37.840]  But look, don't you find it shocking that the federal government will openly allow aspartame
[47:37.840 --> 47:42.440]  in the food supply, MSG in the food supply, sodium nitrite in the processed meat, which
[47:42.440 --> 47:44.340]  we know causes cancer.
[47:44.340 --> 47:47.920]  They will allow GMOs to be hidden in the food supply.
[47:47.920 --> 47:52.680]  The FDA is being petitioned right now to allow aspartame to be part of the definition of
[47:52.680 --> 47:55.240]  milk so they don't even have to put it on the label.
[47:55.240 --> 47:59.720]  Cows are being injected with a drug from Merck to fatten them up in the last few days of
[47:59.720 --> 48:03.880]  their lives so they weigh more and the cattle factories get more.
[48:03.880 --> 48:05.880]  All of this is openly tolerated, Joe.
[48:05.880 --> 48:10.320]  The government says you can poison yourself to death with all these food additives and
[48:10.320 --> 48:17.080]  artificial colors and GMOs, but then they attack you for selling cheese that isn't sterilized.
[48:17.080 --> 48:19.080]  This is incredible.
[48:19.080 --> 48:26.680]  Yeah, we, the state bill for a while, or else the state of Missouri, whichever one it was
[48:26.680 --> 48:29.440]  that our cheese, we couldn't even sell it for dog food.
[48:29.440 --> 48:33.880]  They said that because they told us here on the side, they were concerned that we could
[48:33.880 --> 48:36.920]  contaminate the dog food plant it went to.
[48:36.920 --> 48:37.920]  Now think about this.
[48:37.920 --> 48:40.800]  Well, let's take this one illness without any proper testing.
[48:40.800 --> 48:45.920]  Now let's go throughout the rest of the time, the rest of the time we were fighting in court
[48:45.920 --> 48:49.320]  and under regulation, you have to prove you're innocent.
[48:49.320 --> 48:51.560]  They don't have to prove you're guilty.
[48:51.560 --> 48:52.560]  That's right.
[48:52.560 --> 48:53.760]  The due process is thrown out the window.
[48:53.760 --> 48:54.760]  This is true.
[48:54.760 --> 48:55.760]  Yeah.
[48:55.760 --> 48:59.600]  Also, you are not permitted what we were told, trial by jury, which we said we wanted trial
[48:59.600 --> 49:03.360]  by jury because we knew a jury of our peers would at least look at the evidence.
[49:03.360 --> 49:06.560]  Now this is the other thing under not just FDA, but also FTC.
[49:06.560 --> 49:10.200]  They have their own kangaroo court system where you have no rights, you have no trial
[49:10.200 --> 49:11.200]  by jury.
[49:11.200 --> 49:14.260]  You don't even have the normal rules of presenting your own evidence in the way that you would
[49:14.260 --> 49:17.080]  in a regular judicial system trial.
[49:17.080 --> 49:19.600]  So you, you saw it firsthand then, right?
[49:19.600 --> 49:21.600]  Yes, we saw firsthand.
[49:21.600 --> 49:22.600]  Incredible.
[49:22.600 --> 49:26.320]  The FDA came in and did 99 swabs over cheese plant and dairy.
[49:26.320 --> 49:28.600]  They all came back negative.
[49:28.600 --> 49:31.240]  That evidence was, they came back clean.
[49:31.240 --> 49:33.120]  In other words, nothing there.
[49:33.120 --> 49:37.680]  That evidence was not permitted in the state court because those were federal tests.
[49:37.680 --> 49:42.520]  Now think about this, if those tests would have come back positive, do you think they
[49:42.520 --> 49:44.000]  would have been permitted in court?
[49:44.000 --> 49:45.000]  Of course they would have.
[49:45.000 --> 49:46.000]  Of course.
[49:46.000 --> 49:50.560]  Yeah, we want to point to the, to the people of Missouri, we're trying to bring this point
[49:50.560 --> 49:57.680]  out to the people of Missouri and the United States that, that we have, that the judge
[49:57.680 --> 50:07.520]  is paid through tax funds, which some people might consider, um, a, uh, well taxes.
[50:07.520 --> 50:08.520]  Yeah.
[50:08.520 --> 50:09.520]  Right.
[50:09.520 --> 50:10.520]  Okay.
[50:10.520 --> 50:12.160]  The judge is paid through tributes.
[50:12.160 --> 50:14.680]  Yeah, he's on the government payroll.
[50:14.680 --> 50:16.060]  So are the regulators.
[50:16.060 --> 50:17.060]  So are the scientists.
[50:17.060 --> 50:18.060]  Yes.
[50:18.060 --> 50:20.060]  The judge is paid by a tribute.
[50:20.060 --> 50:21.060]  Yeah.
[50:21.060 --> 50:23.060]  The attorney general's office is paid by tribute.
[50:23.060 --> 50:24.060]  Yep.
[50:24.060 --> 50:25.240]  The network's paid by tribute.
[50:25.240 --> 50:26.880]  All confiscated money.
[50:26.880 --> 50:31.760]  So we asked, I'm asking the question, how do you work to get a fair trial under that
[50:31.760 --> 50:32.760]  system?
[50:32.760 --> 50:33.760]  Well, that's, that's the trick.
[50:33.760 --> 50:35.500]  That's the catch 22, Joe Dixon.
[50:35.500 --> 50:36.640]  You don't get a fair trial.
[50:36.640 --> 50:37.720]  Welcome to America.
[50:37.720 --> 50:42.680]  I think it's also fascinating that you could have legally done what you did in North Korea
[50:42.680 --> 50:48.960]  or China or Cuba or South America, but not in the land of the free, the United States
[50:48.960 --> 50:49.960]  of America.
[50:49.960 --> 50:52.740]  Suddenly you're a criminal for making real food.
[50:52.740 --> 50:53.740]  But stay with us, Joe.
[50:53.740 --> 50:57.880]  We'll be right back after this break with more here on the Alice Jones show with Joe
[50:57.880 --> 51:01.400]  Dixon from morning land dairy.
[51:01.400 --> 51:02.880]  Your freedoms are on the line.
[51:02.880 --> 51:04.720]  The second amendment is in danger.
[51:04.720 --> 51:07.120]  How soon before your freedoms are taken away.
[51:07.120 --> 51:08.840]  What can you not live without?
[51:08.840 --> 51:10.480]  What is your greatest dependency?
[51:10.480 --> 51:11.480]  Is it your guns?
[51:11.480 --> 51:12.480]  Is it your home?
[51:12.480 --> 51:13.840]  No, it's food.
[51:13.840 --> 51:15.960]  It all boils down to the food supply.
[51:15.960 --> 51:19.680]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[51:19.680 --> 51:20.680]  Don't be dependent.
[51:20.680 --> 51:21.960]  Be self-sufficient.
[51:21.960 --> 51:23.560]  Don't wait for the government to feed you.
[51:23.560 --> 51:24.560]  Feed yourself.
[51:24.560 --> 51:26.800]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[51:26.800 --> 51:30.400]  Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from E foods direct.
[51:30.400 --> 51:33.160]  It's the best longterm storable food on the planet.

[52:00.680 --> 52:03.720]  Is this the year you finally get serious about your family's drinking water?
[52:03.720 --> 52:07.280]  If so, keep listening for a special offer from big Berkey water filters.
[52:07.280 --> 52:10.360]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water is fluoridated?
[52:10.360 --> 52:13.440]  Berkey water filters distinguish themselves from many other filtration systems with the
[52:13.440 --> 52:17.520]  capability to significantly reduce dangerous chlorine, fluoride, arsenic and disinfection
[52:17.520 --> 52:21.240]  byproducts from municipal water via the black Berkey and PF line of filters.
[52:21.240 --> 52:22.240]  Then there's affordability.
[52:22.240 --> 52:24.400]  It only 1.7 cents per gallon.
[52:24.400 --> 52:28.480]  Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, even stagnant pond water.
[52:28.480 --> 52:32.000]  Stop and think how much money you could save by simply reducing buying bottled water and
[52:32.000 --> 52:34.480]  using water filtered by your Berkey water filter.
[52:34.480 --> 52:37.260]  No need to be constantly replacing expensive filters with a Berkey.
[52:37.260 --> 52:39.760]  A single set of filters can last for five to 10 years.
[52:39.760 --> 52:43.580]  Choose the best size Berkey for your needs at big Berkey water filters.com and right

[52:57.000 --> 52:59.760]  Big Berkey water filters for the love of clean water.
[52:59.760 --> 53:02.600]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates.
[53:02.600 --> 53:05.940]  Do you know the number one most valuable item in a crisis?
[53:05.940 --> 53:10.880]  Some people think the answer is gold, others think it's a gun, but the correct answer will
[53:10.880 --> 53:11.880]  shock you.
[53:11.880 --> 53:18.080]  I just created a free video at crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item that is more
[53:18.080 --> 53:20.560]  valuable than gold in a crisis.
[53:20.560 --> 53:24.240]  Ninety-seven percent of Americans don't have this one critical item.
[53:24.240 --> 53:28.920]  In fact, they haven't even given it a thought and the sad truth is that you may not survive
[53:28.920 --> 53:34.260]  without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door, but I have
[53:34.260 --> 53:38.960]  to tell you it could literally make the difference between life and death for you and your family.
[53:38.960 --> 53:45.120]  Watch my video at crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis.
[53:45.120 --> 53:46.480]  You'll be shocked.
[53:46.480 --> 53:50.100]  See the controversial video that thousands of other smart patriots have already seen
[53:50.100 --> 53:51.680]  in the last three months.
[53:51.680 --> 53:57.320]  Go watch my video now at crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down.
[53:57.320 --> 54:09.840]  Again, that's crisis123.com.
[54:09.840 --> 54:14.440]  What you're hearing is an interview with Joe Dixon from Morningland Dairy in Missouri and
[54:14.440 --> 54:20.800]  this is Mike Adams filling in for Alex Jones today and this is the Alex Jones Show and
[54:20.800 --> 54:23.280]  this is just so you know you're in the right spot.
[54:23.280 --> 54:28.640]  And what we're hearing is a classic example of government coercion and if you wonder why
[54:28.640 --> 54:34.040]  things are so bad in America today, I mean America is still a wonderful country and if
[54:34.040 --> 54:38.920]  we can restore it to what it used to be, it can be the world leader again in so many areas
[54:38.920 --> 54:43.960]  including morals and ethics by the way, but the reason it has devolved so much is because
[54:43.960 --> 54:48.800]  of exactly the kind of thing we're hearing about here where they're destroying real food.
[54:48.800 --> 54:52.880]  They're destroying farmers, putting them out of business and now Joe Dixon, we've only
[54:52.880 --> 54:59.160]  got a couple minutes left with you here, but Iowa has now a proposed bill to legalize raw
[54:59.160 --> 55:02.160]  milk in the state of Iowa.
[55:02.160 --> 55:07.720]  Are you familiar with other legislative efforts to legalize this so that consumers can have
[55:07.720 --> 55:10.640]  their food freedom even in the face of federal tyranny?
[55:10.640 --> 55:17.000]  Yes, there are many states that are headed that direction as far as to try to get it
[55:17.000 --> 55:25.160]  unless the audience and families of the audience and people that the audience knows gets involved
[55:25.160 --> 55:29.480]  in calling their representatives and saying, look, we have these rights.
[55:29.480 --> 55:35.080]  We do not permit you to take these rights from us and that's what's happened.
[55:35.080 --> 55:40.640]  We have permitted the system to take these rights from us without questioning what's
[55:40.640 --> 55:41.640]  going on.
[55:41.640 --> 55:42.640]  That's right.
[55:42.640 --> 55:43.640]  We've tolerated it.
[55:43.640 --> 55:48.120]  Yes, we have tolerated it and we now look where we are now because we have tolerated
[55:48.120 --> 55:49.120]  it.
[55:49.120 --> 55:52.120]  Now they've become the head, we've become the tail and that's where they want it to
[55:52.120 --> 55:53.120]  be.
[55:53.120 --> 55:59.080]  And the only way it gets turned around is by people standing up and becoming a self-regulating,
[55:59.080 --> 56:01.280]  self-controlling people again.
[56:01.280 --> 56:05.600]  I think our forefathers stated that, that we had to be a self-regulating people in order
[56:05.600 --> 56:10.680]  to keep the type of constitutional government we have that will actually function to the
[56:10.680 --> 56:13.520]  benefit of the people, not to the benefit of the government.
[56:13.520 --> 56:14.520]  That's right.
[56:14.520 --> 56:18.120]  It's to be the people telling the government what the government is allowed to do and enforcing
[56:18.120 --> 56:21.720]  the limits of government, not the other way around where the government tells you what
[56:21.720 --> 56:25.360]  rights you will be granted by the kings in Washington.
[56:25.360 --> 56:32.480]  Yeah, and what happened to us, there's another case in Northwest Missouri where another dairy
[56:32.480 --> 56:38.880]  farm that has a small cheese plant, they treated them a lot more fairly because we think because
[56:38.880 --> 56:41.960]  of the way we questioned them here.
[56:41.960 --> 56:47.200]  Because with everything that went on here, as I said earlier about couldn't even sell
[56:47.200 --> 56:52.200]  up for dog food, think about this, they came in two and a half years later under judge's
[56:52.200 --> 56:56.960]  orders to destroy the cheese, 36,000 pounds, 36,400 pounds of cheese.
[56:56.960 --> 57:02.080]  Well that's because you dared to question their sovereignty as they say.
[57:02.080 --> 57:08.880]  But look, I want to give out your web address here, Joe, so that people go to morninglanddairy.com.
[57:08.880 --> 57:12.840]  If you want to support Joe's efforts, read up there, there's a donation link, there's
[57:12.840 --> 57:18.580]  an un-cheese party that's mentioned there, and I really want you to support Joe and spread
[57:18.580 --> 57:20.860]  the word about Joe Dixon and his farm.
[57:20.860 --> 57:26.040]  And Joe, we're out of time for today, but I want to thank you for coming on and I really
[57:26.040 --> 57:27.040]  appreciate what you're doing.
[57:27.040 --> 57:31.040]  And if possible, I wouldn't mind coming on again to go a little further.
[57:31.040 --> 57:32.040]  Yeah.
[57:32.040 --> 57:33.040]  I would like to say one more thing real quick.
[57:33.040 --> 57:34.040]  Sure, go ahead.
[57:34.040 --> 57:38.420]  When the state came in to destroy the cheese, they came in in regular clothes, they came
[57:38.420 --> 57:42.880]  in with their street clothes that they normally go to work in, regular gloves, they picked
[57:42.880 --> 57:48.840]  up 36,000 pounds of cheese by hand, which 60 to 80% would look really good yet.
[57:48.840 --> 57:52.280]  But some of it, imagine your refrigerator is being closed for two and a half years and
[57:52.280 --> 57:53.280]  then going back to it.
[57:53.280 --> 57:54.280]  Yeah.
[57:54.280 --> 57:55.280]  You know, it was refrigerated.
[57:55.280 --> 57:58.360]  But some of the cheese, the whey was still coming out of it.
[57:58.360 --> 58:02.920]  So they got this whey that was supposed to be so contaminated, we couldn't even sell
[58:02.920 --> 58:08.360]  it for dog food, to be pasteurized, then they get it on their clothes, they get it on them
[58:08.360 --> 58:09.360]  themselves.
[58:09.360 --> 58:12.360]  They get back in their state vehicles and take it in their state vehicles.
[58:12.360 --> 58:13.360]  Right.
[58:13.360 --> 58:15.560]  They contaminate it and then they blame it on you.
[58:15.560 --> 58:23.680]  It's classic government tactic of quack science, bad politics, destruction of food, destruction
[58:23.680 --> 58:24.680]  of farmers.
[58:24.680 --> 58:28.080]  I'm sorry you've been victimized by them, Joe, but I thank you for joining us today.
[58:28.080 --> 58:30.080]  We will talk with you again in the future.
[58:30.080 --> 58:32.840]  Mike, the only way we've been victimized is to...
[58:32.840 --> 58:33.840]  All right, Joe.
[58:33.840 --> 58:34.840]  Yeah.
[58:34.840 --> 58:35.840]  Sorry, we're almost out of time.
[58:35.840 --> 58:36.840]  But stay with us, folks.
[58:36.840 --> 58:37.840]  We'll be right back with a lot more straight ahead here on the Alex Jones Show.
[58:37.840 --> 58:38.840]  We'll be right back.
[58:38.840 --> 58:51.160]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.

[58:56.560 --> 58:58.160]  damage in the human body.

[59:56.100 --> 01:00:05.400]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:10.200]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.200 --> 01:00:11.200]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:13.320]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:17.520]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:22.840]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.840 --> 01:00:30.960]  All right, welcome to our number two here on the Alex Jones broadcast.
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:36.160]  Live from Austin, Texas, and we've got coming up in the third hour today, an interview between
[01:00:36.160 --> 01:00:44.160]  Alex Jones and Immortal Technique, the rap artist, musical artist, poet of our modern
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:45.160]  age.
[01:00:45.160 --> 01:00:50.080]  In fact, we're going to be talking to Ashle Eldridge Seasons here in just the next few
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:51.080]  minutes.
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:56.480]  He's the creator of the Food Fight video that's going viral, teaching inner city audiences
[01:00:56.480 --> 01:01:01.020]  about the importance of saying no to processed foods and telling the truth about how those
[01:01:01.020 --> 01:01:03.480]  junk foods are actually killing us.
[01:01:03.480 --> 01:01:08.880]  It's funny, the government will go crazy, even the public will go crazy, over children
[01:01:08.880 --> 01:01:16.400]  dying at Sandy Hook, which is understandable, but they will ignore how many children get
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:24.120]  brain cancer from eating processed, contaminated, genetically modified, chemically adulterated
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:25.120]  food.
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:30.040]  There's got to be orders of magnitude more children every year dying from that than dying
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:37.160]  from being shot by a madman in a school setting.
[01:01:37.160 --> 01:01:40.900]  But you don't hear anything about that.
[01:01:40.900 --> 01:01:45.120]  And they think the gun-free zone sign is going to solve the problem, as if it's a magical
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:46.120]  sign.
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:51.080]  The sign of signs, you know, there's something really funny about Texas that if you live
[01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:52.300]  here you've seen these things.
[01:01:52.300 --> 01:02:00.000]  They have signs on the sides of the highways that say, obey all signs, state law.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:03.360]  So they actually have a sign that says, obey all the signs.
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:10.800]  Now I'm thinking, what genius in the Texas Transportation Department came up with this?
[01:02:10.800 --> 01:02:15.200]  Because if you think about it, who is this sign really for?
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:20.520]  Because if you're the kind of person that already follows signs, then this sign is not
[01:02:20.520 --> 01:02:22.640]  going to make any more difference.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:26.880]  You're already following the signs, so you don't need another sign to say, obey the other
[01:02:26.880 --> 01:02:28.060]  signs.
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:32.580]  But if you're the kind of person who doesn't follow signs, then you're not going to follow
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:35.280]  the sign that says to follow the signs.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:42.720]  But somehow the Texas Highway Department thinks that this one sign is magical, that this sign,
[01:02:42.720 --> 01:02:49.000]  just like the gun-free zone sign, is a sign that has magical powers that you follow just
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.720]  this one sign which says, obey all the other signs, and then you magically obey all the
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:53.720]  other signs.
[01:02:53.720 --> 01:03:00.720]  So you see, we've got to end this, I don't know what this is, it's like a sign superstition,
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:03.960]  sign mythology, sign voodoo.
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:04.960]  That's what it is.
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:10.640]  There's voodoo going on in the Texas Transportation Department with these signs that say, obey
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:13.040]  all the other signs.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:16.880]  Now in truth, what the sign really does is it probably causes more accidents because
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:20.400]  people are trying to read the dang sign when they should be driving.
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:24.840]  So instead of actually preventing accidents and improving safety, it's like you're driving
[01:03:24.840 --> 01:03:27.180]  along, holy cow, there's a sign, what does it say?
[01:03:27.180 --> 01:03:28.180]  Obey the other signs.
[01:03:28.180 --> 01:03:29.180]  What signs?
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:33.520]  And then you run right into a tractor trailer, and then you got a big accident.
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:39.820]  30 something thousand people die every year in America on the roads probably from reading
[01:03:39.820 --> 01:03:42.220]  those dang signs.
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:44.600]  That's probably what it is, yep.
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.960]  And you notice, by the way, the government doesn't ban cars.
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:53.840]  No, no, they don't say, well, gosh, even if we can save one child in a car crash, we have
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:57.240]  to do everything possible, including banning all automobiles.
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:03:59.820]  That would be the logic that the gun control people have.
[01:03:59.820 --> 01:04:00.820]  That's their logic.
[01:04:00.820 --> 01:04:06.700]  If we can save one life, it's worth killing tens of thousands of people according to them.
[01:04:06.700 --> 01:04:08.320]  That's how crazy they are.
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:13.040]  No, you take a risk every time you get on the highway, you take a risk.
[01:04:13.040 --> 01:04:14.840]  That's what seat belts are for, you know?
[01:04:14.840 --> 01:04:16.120]  Same thing about raw milk.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:20.260]  You can't live a life completely free of risk, and any government that tries to eliminate
[01:04:20.260 --> 01:04:23.540]  all risk in your life just becomes a tyranny.
[01:04:23.540 --> 01:04:27.520]  It just becomes a police state with oppression.
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:31.320]  You can't have government eliminate all risk in your life.
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:32.640]  Getting in a car is a risk.
[01:04:32.640 --> 01:04:34.760]  And by the way, real quick, a correction.
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:41.760]  Last time I was on, I was talking about aquaponics, and I use the term aquaculture accidentally.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:47.920]  Yeah, because sometimes, you know, the CPU skips a couple of cycles when you're in here
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.760]  in studio, but it's aquaponics.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:54.640]  That's the name, that's the term to grow fish and plants together indoors, food production.
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:55.640]  It's amazing.
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:04:56.640]  Aquaponics, not aquaculture.
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:57.640]  Totally different thing.
[01:04:57.640 --> 01:04:58.640]  Stay with us.
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.640]  We'll be right back.

[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:11.840]  Is it your guns?
[01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:12.840]  Is it your home?
[01:07:12.840 --> 01:07:14.200]  No, it's food.
[01:07:14.200 --> 01:07:16.280]  It all boils down to the food supply.
[01:07:16.280 --> 01:07:20.000]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.040]  Don't be dependent.
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:22.280]  Be self-sufficient.
[01:07:22.280 --> 01:07:23.900]  Don't wait for the government to feed you.
[01:07:23.900 --> 01:07:24.900]  Feed yourself.
[01:07:24.900 --> 01:07:27.120]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:30.720]  Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from eFoods Direct.

[01:08:10.240 --> 01:08:11.240]  You want answers?
[01:08:11.240 --> 01:08:13.380]  Well, so does he.
[01:08:13.380 --> 01:08:17.580]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:22.760]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:08:22.760 --> 01:08:28.360]  Welcome, welcome back to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:08:28.360 --> 01:08:29.640]  Thank you for joining us today.
[01:08:29.640 --> 01:08:35.720]  This is Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, filling in for Alex today on this Friday, March 1st.
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:36.720]  It is March 1st.
[01:08:36.720 --> 01:08:39.080]  It's amazing how time flies.
[01:08:39.080 --> 01:08:40.080]  2013.
[01:08:40.080 --> 01:08:41.920]  Yeah, we all survived 2012.
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:43.320]  Yes, we did.
[01:08:43.320 --> 01:08:47.560]  Just like we said here on the show, you know, the mind calendar thing was a non-issue.
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:51.020]  We said that over and over again.
[01:08:51.020 --> 01:08:55.520]  And people still said that Alex Jones was saying the world would end on December 21st.
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:08:57.400]  No, he didn't.
[01:08:57.400 --> 01:09:02.760]  I'm always amazed by how the media says Alex said something that he never said.
[01:09:02.760 --> 01:09:04.280]  He's become like the scapegoat.
[01:09:04.280 --> 01:09:09.160]  Whenever they want to say that somebody said something crazy, they make something up like,
[01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:15.560]  oh, yeah, yeah, somebody out there said lizard people were invading the Library of Congress.
[01:09:15.560 --> 01:09:21.400]  It must have been Alex Jones, they say, you know, they just come up with whatever crazy
[01:09:21.400 --> 01:09:24.520]  stuff they come up with, they blame Alex.
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:29.320]  And I listen to every broadcast, not in real time, I listen to it later.
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:33.320]  And so I hear what Alex says, and I know the mainstream media is full of bunk on that,
[01:09:33.320 --> 01:09:38.520]  so you're getting it here from another independent verified source that Alex did not say the
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:41.480]  world was going to end on December 21st.
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:44.720]  He said it's a non-issue, and he was right, once again.
[01:09:44.720 --> 01:09:46.240]  He also warned you about the drones.
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:51.760]  He warned you about the robot warriors that the military is putting together.
[01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:53.480]  He warned you about all that stuff.
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:59.440]  Today is a milestone day, and here's why.
[01:09:59.440 --> 01:10:06.640]  The entire Health Ranger Select product line is now going to be in the InfoWars store.
[01:10:06.640 --> 01:10:09.640]  So if you want to check it out, go to infowarsstore.com.
[01:10:09.640 --> 01:10:16.560]  But just, you may not even know my history, but briefly, I used to be borderline diabetic,
[01:10:16.560 --> 01:10:18.920]  borderline obese.
[01:10:18.920 --> 01:10:21.600]  I suffered from chronic pain, I had high cholesterol.
[01:10:21.600 --> 01:10:26.400]  This was when I was about 30 years old, and I had grown up eating, well, not grown up,
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:33.400]  but throughout my 20s, I got on a real bad diet, junk food, processed food, wasn't exercising,
[01:10:33.400 --> 01:10:34.400]  all that.
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.720]  I was in real bad shape by the time I was age 30.
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:40.680]  And I got healthy by turning to foods and nutrition, and that's how I became the Health
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:41.680]  Ranger.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:43.840]  That's where my nickname comes from, in case you're wondering.
[01:10:43.840 --> 01:10:50.200]  And then I started Natural News and began educating others and built that to now a massive
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:54.520]  information network, five million unique visitors a month over there.
[01:10:54.520 --> 01:11:02.320]  And recently, we started sourcing products that are totally non-GMO, not from China,
[01:11:02.320 --> 01:11:10.120]  pristine, well-researched, superfoods and supplements, and just the best of the best
[01:11:10.120 --> 01:11:13.880]  that we could find all over the place, all over the world, except China, because I don't
[01:11:13.880 --> 01:11:16.200]  like buying things from China.
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:19.840]  And we got certified organic, we have a certified organic facility here in Texas.
[01:11:19.840 --> 01:11:26.040]  Alex asked me, he said, Mike, you gotta make this stuff available to InfoWars listeners,
[01:11:26.040 --> 01:11:30.000]  and then they can also help support the broadcast through the InfoWars store.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:35.480]  So would you be willing to bring that in and offer us that at wholesale prices?
[01:11:35.480 --> 01:11:38.200]  And I said, yeah, sure, let's do it, let's make it happen.
[01:11:38.200 --> 01:11:44.400]  So as of today, that's happening, and we have turmeric extract, a very potent turmeric that
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:49.340]  is the most potent turmeric extract made with organic turmeric.
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:50.340]  That's available now.
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:52.040]  We've got clean chlorella.
[01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:55.480]  We researched all the chlorella superfood everywhere around the world.
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:56.720]  We did the lab test.
[01:11:56.720 --> 01:11:59.320]  We found the two cleanest sources in the world.
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:03.520]  This is the number one cleanest source right here, clean chlorella, comes out of South
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.160]  Korea, actually.
[01:12:05.160 --> 01:12:08.640]  The chlorella's not grown in the USA, by the way, so you gotta go outside the country.
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:14.040]  And then right now, we have fine ground Himalayan salt, a full spectrum, full-bodied salt loaded
[01:12:14.040 --> 01:12:15.880]  with trace minerals.
[01:12:15.880 --> 01:12:16.880]  So that's available.
[01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:22.740]  Just go to infowarsstore.com, your purchase helps support the Infowars broadcast.
[01:12:22.740 --> 01:12:25.520]  And I'm just happy to be part of it, to be able to bring these great products.
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:29.200]  We've got more coming, all non-GMO.
[01:12:29.200 --> 01:12:35.680]  I'm the kind of guy who goes to sources and says, you can't have hidden maltodextrin in
[01:12:35.680 --> 01:12:37.300]  the fruit powders.
[01:12:37.300 --> 01:12:42.300]  You can't have heavy metals in the product, otherwise, I won't even put my name on it.
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:43.940]  So cleanest of the clean.
[01:12:43.940 --> 01:12:48.520]  And by the way, speaking of clean food, Enterfood, the full product line of Enterfood is available
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:50.360]  in the Infowars store.
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:55.160]  Enterfood, just to confirm, they don't source any ingredients from China either, nothing
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:56.640]  from China.
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:13:01.880]  Enterfood, just one of the very top, most amazing superfoods out there, the full product
[01:13:01.880 --> 01:13:03.960]  line at the Infowars store.
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:06.520]  So again, thank you for supporting the broadcast.
[01:13:06.520 --> 01:13:11.480]  And you might wonder why all of us are really all about nutrition these days, it's because
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:12.620]  we're trying to survive.
[01:13:12.620 --> 01:13:18.440]  We're trying to survive the toxic poisons, the GMOs, the fluoride in the water.
[01:13:18.440 --> 01:13:24.120]  We're trying to make it through all this with our brains intact and our fertility intact
[01:13:24.120 --> 01:13:26.040]  and our bodies intact.
[01:13:26.040 --> 01:13:31.520]  Speaking of food news, check this out, Taco Bell now finds traces of horse meat in its
[01:13:31.520 --> 01:13:32.520]  UK products.
[01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:35.680]  Now, you heard about horse meat last week and the week before, I think, but this is
[01:13:35.680 --> 01:13:40.880]  Taco Bell now saying, traces of horse meat and some of its products on sale in the UK.
[01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:43.520]  Now, look, I have a different take on this.
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:47.760]  A lot of people are freaked out by horse meat in their food.
[01:13:47.760 --> 01:13:48.760]  Are you kidding me?
[01:13:48.760 --> 01:13:53.120]  Horse meat is perfectly healthy for you, the stuff you really need to be worried about
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:14:00.020]  is the MSG, the GMO, the aspartame, the sodium nitrite, the chemical additives, the heavy
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:02.320]  metals that are in a lot of these foods.
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:09.520]  I don't care about a little horse meat in a Taco Bell taco, not that I even eat at Taco
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:13.360]  Bell anyway, but if I did, I wouldn't care about a little horse meat in there.
[01:14:13.360 --> 01:14:16.080]  What I would be worried about are the other chemicals.
[01:14:16.080 --> 01:14:21.560]  I mean, let's face it, horse meat, even though morally and ethically you might say, well,
[01:14:21.560 --> 01:14:26.160]  I don't want to eat horses, but there's nothing nutritionally dangerous in horse meat.
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:30.380]  If you eat meat from a cow, you can eat meat from a horse, folks.
[01:14:30.380 --> 01:14:35.040]  There's virtually no nutritional difference really when it comes down to it.
[01:14:35.040 --> 01:14:39.400]  Horse meat's a little more lean, but there's nothing wrong with horse meat in it.
[01:14:39.400 --> 01:14:44.040]  I'd be more worried about the other stuff, the chemicals that are in the food.
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:48.880]  That's what would be worrying me, because the stuff that's in your food is what's killing
[01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:50.560]  you, right?
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:57.740]  And here joining us to help us understand this message even more is Ashel Eldridge,
[01:14:57.740 --> 01:15:02.400]  Seasons is his nickname, and this guy is amazing.
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:06.880]  I saw his music video, it's called Food Fight, look for it on YouTube.
[01:15:06.880 --> 01:15:09.120]  He's from a group called Earth Amplified.
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:11.200]  He's a spiritual warrior.
[01:15:11.200 --> 01:15:15.120]  He's a warrior of truth and food justice.
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:20.280]  This video speaks to the inner city kids who are growing up on junk food and processed
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:24.840]  food and energy drinks, and what they need to be turning to is real nutrition.
[01:15:24.840 --> 01:15:29.200]  Ashel Eldridge joins us right now on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:15:29.200 --> 01:15:30.440]  Ashel, thank you for joining us.
[01:15:30.440 --> 01:15:31.680]  It's a pleasure to have you on.
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:33.480]  Ashel Eldridge How's it going, Mike?
[01:15:33.480 --> 01:15:34.480]  Pleased to be here.
[01:15:34.480 --> 01:15:40.040]  Well, thank you, thank you for what you do too, how has the reaction been so far to your
[01:15:40.040 --> 01:15:42.040]  Food Fight video?
[01:15:42.040 --> 01:15:46.320]  You able to hear me?
[01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:49.840]  All right, I think he's not hearing me.
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:53.760]  Well, let me know when we got that connection going up, but if you wanna check it out, folks,
[01:15:53.760 --> 01:15:58.960]  it's Food Fight, the video is up on YouTube right now.
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:03.800]  We did a review of it on Natural News, if you wanna check that out, this is a powerful
[01:16:03.800 --> 01:16:08.880]  message, it talks about the Matrix, it talks about the GMOs, it talks about aspartame,
[01:16:08.880 --> 01:16:13.600]  and it's just a very uplifting, empowering message from a very talented artist, are we
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:14.600]  good now?
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:19.160]  All right, we're gonna come back to Ashel, all right, we're getting him back on.
[01:16:19.160 --> 01:16:23.040]  But anyway, the point is that these foods are what's really killing us, so you got a
[01:16:23.040 --> 01:16:28.080]  government that tries to say, well, we wanna keep you safe from a shooting, so we wanna
[01:16:28.080 --> 01:16:29.800]  take away those rights.
[01:16:29.800 --> 01:16:35.540]  Or we wanna keep you safe, like Mayor Bloomberg does in New York, from soda, so we're gonna
[01:16:35.540 --> 01:16:38.480]  ban large soda drinks.
[01:16:38.480 --> 01:16:45.060]  Or we wanna keep you safe from this or that, X, Y, and Z, the list never ends, and the
[01:16:45.060 --> 01:16:50.080]  rules never end, and what you end up with is a society where it's a police state of
[01:16:50.080 --> 01:16:51.080]  total safety.
[01:16:51.080 --> 01:16:55.120]  Yeah, you're safe now because you're not allowed to leave your house, you're not allowed to
[01:16:55.120 --> 01:17:00.120]  turn on the Internet, you're not allowed to go to non-approved websites, might be something
[01:17:00.120 --> 01:17:01.840]  risky there, risky information.
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:07.200]  Or you're not allowed to buy raw cheese, raw dairy, you're not allowed to do anything.
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:11.080]  Hey, in Oregon, you're not even allowed to collect rainwater in your field, they sent
[01:17:11.080 --> 01:17:16.600]  a guy to jail for 30 days there just for collecting rainwater.
[01:17:16.600 --> 01:17:22.440]  So they wanna sell you on the idea of safety while they're really enslaving you.
[01:17:22.440 --> 01:17:28.400]  And hey, Hitler created a society that was really, really safe if you weren't targeted
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:29.800]  by Hitler, right?
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:37.320]  I mean, that was the goal for him, to create an amazing society, a golden age of amazing
[01:17:37.320 --> 01:17:42.840]  citizens who are the most upstanding human beings of all, and he wanted to create a super
[01:17:42.840 --> 01:17:46.200]  safe society, but of course, it was a nightmare.
[01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:50.320]  So don't fall for that idea that safety creates abundance, it doesn't.
[01:17:50.320 --> 01:17:55.640]  And we've got Ashel back on the line, he couldn't hear me the last time, Ashel Eldredge, known
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:18:00.800]  as Seasons, has the food fight video that's just amazing.
[01:18:00.800 --> 01:18:03.800]  So Ashel, can you hear me now and welcome to the show?
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:05.920]  Ashel Eldredge Yeah, thanks for inviting me.
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:09.440]  Okay, great, great, sorry about that little technical issue there.
[01:18:09.440 --> 01:18:13.280]  So tell me, what has the reaction been so far?
[01:18:13.280 --> 01:18:16.680]  Your video's only been out a few days, what are you hearing so far?
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:20.800]  Ashel Eldredge Yeah, the reaction is amazing.
[01:18:20.800 --> 01:18:25.200]  Beginning response from people all around the world, actually, who've seen this video,
[01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:33.000]  people in South Africa who are doing agriculture projects with youth, moms in Philadelphia
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.920]  who are, you know, just upset with the food system and what their children are being fed
[01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:43.320]  in schools, people who are, you know, crying, essentially, it was like, you know, I'm
[01:18:43.320 --> 01:18:50.960]  a family farmer in Ireland and I sort of gave up on what I was working on and this video
[01:18:50.960 --> 01:18:55.720]  inspired me again to get back out there and make sure that people had the healthy food.
[01:18:55.720 --> 01:18:57.920]  So it's really inspiring.
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:19:01.960]  Your video is very, very inspiring.
[01:19:01.960 --> 01:19:04.520]  What motivated you to do this?
[01:19:04.520 --> 01:19:07.960]  I mean, were you seeing so many people harmed by processed foods or what?
[01:19:07.960 --> 01:19:09.960]  How did you decide to take this on, this big project?
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:13.800]  Yeah, well, I worked with, um, I worked with the organization Green for All.
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:18.520]  We worked on, you know, sort of green jobs and I was the organizer, spotlight organizer,
[01:19:18.520 --> 01:19:26.040]  so I went around the country and I saw a lot of communities dealing with, you know, nutrition
[01:19:26.040 --> 01:19:34.280]  issues, dealing with diabetes, heart disease, cancer, and at the same time, a lot of people
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:38.600]  really doing it on their own, growing their own food, and there was a small pocket of
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:41.240]  people who didn't want to stay getting the same amount of press and having the same amount
[01:19:41.240 --> 01:19:42.240]  of push.
[01:19:42.240 --> 01:19:44.760]  Um, so I educated myself.
[01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:45.760]  Stay with us, Ashel.
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:46.760]  Sorry to interrupt.
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:48.120]  We've got to go to a quick break, but stay with us.
[01:19:48.120 --> 01:19:51.440]  I've got a lot more questions for you on the other side of this break.
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:56.920]  It's Ashel Eldridge, Seasons, from the Food Fight video.
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:58.080]  He's with us on the Alex Jones show.
[01:19:58.080 --> 01:20:01.200]  We'll be right back with a lot more.
[01:20:01.200 --> 01:20:06.080]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms, but if you don't have a home security
[01:20:06.080 --> 01:20:10.640]  system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:20:10.640 --> 01:20:14.520]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:15.520]  Check out SimpliSafe.
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:20.440]  It's a new do it yourself home security system that is completely wireless.
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:25.840]  Go to getsimplisafe.com SimpliSafe is independent and off the grid.

[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:36.960]  storage unit, or shed.

[01:20:57.440 --> 01:21:00.840]  Again, that's getsimplisafe.com.
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:03.240]  We've lived in this neighborhood for years.
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:06.760]  We have an alarm system, and all of our doors have deadbolts.
[01:21:06.760 --> 01:21:10.400]  They kicked in our door and were in and out of our house in about five minutes.
[01:21:10.400 --> 01:21:15.480]  The police arrived in about 20 minutes, but they were long gone with our TV, jewelry,
[01:21:15.480 --> 01:21:16.480]  and my guns.
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:19.480]  I kept thinking, what if my family had been home?
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:24.880]  The police officer said that more than 85% of break-ins are through a door and that deadbolts
[01:21:24.880 --> 01:21:27.040]  alone don't stop intruders.
[01:21:27.040 --> 01:21:31.400]  The officer told me to go to easyarmor.net if we wanted something that would actually
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:33.060]  stop an intruder.
[01:21:33.060 --> 01:21:38.060]  Easy Armor reinforces all of the weak points on your doors and is guaranteed to prevent
[01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:39.060]  kick-ins.
[01:21:39.060 --> 01:21:45.280]  I was surprised at how little Easy Armor costs, and I installed Easy Armor in about 30 minutes.
[01:21:45.280 --> 01:21:46.760]  Visit easyarmor.net.
[01:21:46.760 --> 01:21:52.120]  That's the letters E-Z-A-R-M-O-R.net, or call 888-58-ARMOR.

[01:22:29.840 --> 01:22:31.200]  Hi this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:31.200 --> 01:22:34.960]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:35.960]  IRAs?
[01:22:35.960 --> 01:22:39.840]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[01:22:39.840 --> 01:22:41.520]  of gold for your retirement.
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:44.960]  Gold is outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:49.840]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[01:23:01.880 --> 01:23:02.880]  Political turmoil.
[01:23:02.880 --> 01:23:03.880]  EMPs.
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:04.880]  Earthquakes.
[01:23:04.880 --> 01:23:05.880]  Tornadoes.
[01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:06.880]  Hurricanes.
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:07.880]  Fires.
[01:23:07.880 --> 01:23:08.880]  Riots.
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:09.880]  Flooding.
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:10.880]  It's not a matter of if, but when.
[01:23:10.880 --> 01:23:11.880]  What if it happened right now?
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:14.200]  Would you have the supplies to survive off the grid?

[01:24:23.640 --> 01:24:29.320]  Alright we're back on the Alex Jones show, an interview with Ashel Seasons, Eldridge,
[01:24:29.320 --> 01:24:34.000]  I think I got the order right there, sorry, I was mispronouncing his name earlier, I didn't
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:38.240]  have a chance to talk to him before the show, but real quick before we go back to Ashel,
[01:24:38.240 --> 01:24:46.800]  the new issue of Infowars magazine is out, and the cover is an American flag with the
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:51.600]  topic of Civil War II, is that what's coming?
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:56.840]  Probably not, but the issue's out, you can get the issue at the Infowars store, you can
[01:24:56.840 --> 01:25:03.160]  subscribe, this is a beautiful glossy print magazine, it's got all kinds of content in
[01:25:03.160 --> 01:25:07.920]  it, check it out at Infowars store dot com, this is awesome, you know, other magazines
[01:25:07.920 --> 01:25:14.760]  are going out of print, but we here at the freedom side of things are getting into print,
[01:25:14.760 --> 01:25:20.300]  and speaking of the main topic here, Civil War, you know, like I said earlier, the systems
[01:25:20.300 --> 01:25:23.760]  of control that exist in our world, they want to get the people fighting with each other,
[01:25:23.760 --> 01:25:28.640]  especially fighting among racial lines, they want to pit black against white, and latino
[01:25:28.640 --> 01:25:32.560]  against white, and everybody else, they just want people fighting with each other so that
[01:25:32.560 --> 01:25:41.240]  they're not fighting the system, and this artist, Ashel, he understands that, he understands
[01:25:41.240 --> 01:25:48.520]  that it's about the people fighting for, with their brothers and sisters and fellow human
[01:25:48.520 --> 01:25:53.960]  beings fighting for freedom against the system, so remember that, it's always about the people
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:59.600]  versus the corporate fascist government system, now, what we really want as a free people
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:03.880]  is we want to be left alone largely, we want to have basic freedoms and basic rights that
[01:26:03.880 --> 01:26:09.200]  can never be touched by any system of government, and that's what the Bill of Rights is, the
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:14.720]  Bill of Rights is supposed to be non-negotiable, in fact, let's see if I can find this quote
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:25.680]  on here, here it is, a great article out of investors.com by Thomas Sowell, where he talks
[01:26:25.680 --> 01:26:31.040]  about the fact that, yeah, people make mistakes, but government makes deadly errors, this is
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:38.160]  his article, and you know, the whole theory of government is that there is a group of
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:43.000]  elite people at the top who are wiser and smarter than everybody else and they should
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:49.480]  tell us what to do and what to eat and how to live our lives, and it turns out that individuals
[01:26:49.480 --> 01:26:55.360]  are smarter than those systems, especially when those systems are corporate control systems,
[01:26:55.360 --> 01:26:58.760]  which is what we see in the food system, the medical system and so on, and so again, getting
[01:26:58.760 --> 01:27:03.960]  back to Ashel, a guy who really gets that, he understands that this is about people fighting
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:09.480]  alongside people for people freedom, individual freedom against the system, he gets that,
[01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:14.280]  and his music video, Food Fight, is of course going viral all across the internet, so Ashel,
[01:27:14.280 --> 01:27:19.520]  welcome back, sorry about the connection problems we had there, so continuing with your thoughts
[01:27:19.520 --> 01:27:21.520]  before the break, go ahead.
[01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:27.080]  Yeah, you know, I'm from Chicago originally and my grandmother, you know, she passed away
[01:27:27.080 --> 01:27:32.060]  from diabetes when I was eight years old, so it's witnessing that and then going deeper
[01:27:32.060 --> 01:27:37.280]  in the investigation of sort of the food legacy, my family and a lot of families around the
[01:27:37.280 --> 01:27:42.840]  United States particularly, so the low-income communities, people of color, try to see the
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:49.200]  same trend around this disease, and what I wanted to do because I work with a lot of
[01:27:49.200 --> 01:27:54.680]  young folks and I work on my hip-hop artists, I wanted to reclaim that art form and really
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:28:01.760]  communicate to young people so that they have, you know, this awareness around what's against
[01:28:01.760 --> 01:28:06.320]  them in a lot of ways, and also how they can empower themselves to liberate themselves
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:11.000]  through their food, through growing their food and just being healthy, getting the earth
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:16.720]  inside of them, so that's why we created SOS, Q System out of your system, the non-profit
[01:28:16.720 --> 01:28:23.000]  for-profit hybrid, health education, nutrition education, growing your food, and also some
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.560]  business incubation there too, so for folks coming out of prison and low-income communities
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:31.280]  that can actually be a part of that, but obviously this is an issue that everyone around the
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:38.480]  world is dealing with, the soil not having the same amount of power that it used to have,
[01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:45.560]  and you see the systems we created being efficient and falling apart all over the place, we gotta
[01:28:45.560 --> 01:28:49.880]  create some food sovereignty and start taking responsibility for ourselves.
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:55.480]  You know, also, I watched your video several times, I don't know how deeply you touched
[01:28:55.480 --> 01:29:01.400]  on this issue, but I'm sure you get this, that, you know, you come from Chicago and
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:07.000]  that's a city that's wracked by violence, but there's a link between violence and what
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:11.560]  you might call violent food or processed food, dead food, if you grow up, if you are fed
[01:29:11.560 --> 01:29:18.920]  these kinds of chemicals and these refined adulterated foods, you become less of a person
[01:29:18.920 --> 01:29:23.720]  who can get along in society, I mean, this is true across the board.
[01:29:23.720 --> 01:29:30.600]  No, that's exactly right, I mean, so in taking responsibility for our health, we take responsibility
[01:29:30.600 --> 01:29:35.640]  for our wealth and our future, I mean, if your immune system is weak, you know, you
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:38.760]  really can't, you can't take care of yourself, you have to come home.
[01:29:38.760 --> 01:29:41.800]  Yeah, Seasons, will you stay with us again through the one more break and then we'll
[01:29:41.800 --> 01:29:46.200]  have a long segment on the other side, stay with us, we'll be right back on the Alex Jones
[01:29:46.200 --> 01:29:50.120]  show with more about the fight for food justice in America, stay with us.
[01:29:50.120 --> 01:30:01.720]  Here on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:32:08.120 --> 01:32:12.760]  Fortunately, a new and vastly improved silver solution has been developed.
[01:32:12.760 --> 01:32:19.560]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary broad spectrum antibacterial, antiviral, antifungal
[01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:23.560]  solution that can be used inside the body as well as on the skin.
[01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:30.040]  Supernatural Silver is unique and superior to colloidal and ionic silvers using a patented
[01:32:30.040 --> 01:32:35.080]  technology that is highly effective against colds, flus, infections, food poisoning and
[01:32:35.080 --> 01:32:37.480]  yeast in addition to many other pathogens.
[01:32:37.480 --> 01:32:43.480]  Supernatural Silver is scientifically supported, extremely safe and is the number one choice
[01:32:43.480 --> 01:32:46.360]  of thousands of people for immune system support.

[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:15.960]  There we go.
[01:33:16.760 --> 01:33:17.960]  More cowbell.
[01:33:17.960 --> 01:33:25.640]  Yeah, welcome back to the Alex Jones show and we're joined by Ashel Seasons, Eldridge,
[01:33:25.640 --> 01:33:26.600]  the creator of Food Fight.
[01:33:26.600 --> 01:33:29.960]  We got a long segment here now, so no more commercial interruptions for a while.
[01:33:30.600 --> 01:33:32.120]  Ashel, I wanted to ask you about this.
[01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:38.360]  What really intrigued me about your music video Food Fight is that it's a message to
[01:33:38.360 --> 01:33:39.880]  the inner city communities.
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:42.760]  It's a message that we don't often hear.
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:52.120]  You know, in terms of how this plays out in terms of race, we often see the super sort
[01:33:52.120 --> 01:33:58.040]  of stringent food purists tend to be a lot of white folks.
[01:33:58.040 --> 01:34:02.600]  And then the Latino communities, they're having diabetes problems because no one's telling
[01:34:02.600 --> 01:34:05.320]  them that drinking all the soda is giving you diabetes.
[01:34:05.320 --> 01:34:08.520]  And then the African American communities are dying from breast cancer and prostate
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:13.720]  cancer because nobody's telling them that dark skin pigmentation blocks vitamin D.
[01:34:13.720 --> 01:34:16.360]  And if you're deficient in vitamin D, you're going to get cancer.
[01:34:16.360 --> 01:34:22.600]  And it's like your message is speaking to this and it's desperately needed.
[01:34:22.600 --> 01:34:26.680]  Are you getting comments about the importance of what you're doing?
[01:34:28.120 --> 01:34:29.160]  Yeah, definitely getting a lot of comments.
[01:34:29.160 --> 01:34:36.760]  I mean, I'm not sure about the details around the skin pigmentation, but I think that, you
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:41.080]  know, and also like, you know, big ups to Ben Zono, New Message Media worked on a couple
[01:34:41.080 --> 01:34:46.760]  of projects with him around like banning plastic bags, for example, plastic state of mind.
[01:34:46.760 --> 01:34:50.280]  There's a huge community of people around the country who are working on this issue
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:34:51.560]  of food justice for the community.
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:55.880]  And I think that where we at is just a crucial moment.
[01:34:55.880 --> 01:34:58.920]  A lot of people are just waking up to the fact that they're sick and tired and they're
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:35:00.360]  tired of being sick and tired.
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:06.280]  And you know, the hospital bills are off the chain and we're losing people left and right.
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:08.760]  Sure, we're losing people to a war abroad.
[01:35:08.760 --> 01:35:11.800]  We're losing people in a lot of different ways.
[01:35:11.800 --> 01:35:17.640]  But one thing I think that we haven't that I think is a unifying factor for a lot of
[01:35:17.640 --> 01:35:22.440]  people across different cultures even is the food.
[01:35:22.440 --> 01:35:29.640]  So obviously we see, I mean, you look at the statistics, advertisements around, you know,
[01:35:29.640 --> 01:35:35.240]  name your soft drink, name your fast food chain, they're definitely placed in these
[01:35:35.240 --> 01:35:36.040]  low-income communities.
[01:35:36.040 --> 01:35:40.680]  So I mean, I see that as an individual who's doing a lot of organizing and stuff like that.
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:42.840]  I see that as intentional in a lot of ways.
[01:35:42.840 --> 01:35:48.520]  But also at the same time, I see that as something that can be brought down once you bring awareness
[01:35:48.520 --> 01:35:48.920]  to it.
[01:35:48.920 --> 01:35:53.480]  As an artist, I think it's our responsibility in the front lines a little bit energetically
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:56.440]  to put out images to hit people in the conscious.
[01:35:58.440 --> 01:36:02.520]  So it's amazing to hear people like, yeah, after watching the video, I felt bad about
[01:36:02.520 --> 01:36:06.040]  the skills that I ate beforehand or I'm actually going to change my diet after that.
[01:36:07.080 --> 01:36:12.360]  And that's something that we can go, sure, we can go bang on the wall in DC.
[01:36:12.360 --> 01:36:14.600]  We can do a lot of things.
[01:36:14.600 --> 01:36:21.080]  But I think that, and all of it's important, but I think that the way we're operating right
[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:24.280]  now is to work with this medium.
[01:36:24.280 --> 01:36:29.640]  And it's also an example for other artists, too, to step up and say, hey, we need to produce
[01:36:29.640 --> 01:36:34.200]  the media, that the media is being owned and controlled and corporatized as well.
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:37.320]  We need to actually create our own media.
[01:36:37.320 --> 01:36:41.080]  So this really is about like sovereignty, you know, food sovereignty, sovereignty of
[01:36:41.080 --> 01:36:47.320]  the individual responsibility for themselves and any grown old food and depending upon
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:47.720]  the system.
[01:36:47.720 --> 01:36:51.640]  Well, that's where the power really comes from is the individual power.
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:55.640]  And what I like about your videos, it shows individuals making choices instead of eating
[01:36:55.640 --> 01:37:01.560]  the processed food, which really enslaves all of us, no matter what our racial background.
[01:37:01.560 --> 01:37:06.360]  We are all enslaved in a system of disease and health care or sick care, actually, if
[01:37:06.360 --> 01:37:08.760]  we live our lives consuming those processed foods.
[01:37:08.760 --> 01:37:14.120]  So if we want to be free people, empowered people, capable people, we have to make that
[01:37:14.120 --> 01:37:17.080]  individual choice every single day about what we put into our mouths.
[01:37:17.640 --> 01:37:18.200]  Absolutely.
[01:37:18.760 --> 01:37:20.120]  And I mean, you get that.
[01:37:20.120 --> 01:37:25.480]  And also, your video depicts inner city folks making that choice.
[01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:31.160]  But a lot of people sort of living in the suburbs, they think that anybody can just
[01:37:31.160 --> 01:37:32.840]  go down and buy organic food anywhere.
[01:37:32.840 --> 01:37:38.280]  But in the inner city areas, you can't just get organic food very easily.
[01:37:38.280 --> 01:37:42.120]  What's available there is mostly just processed garbage.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:43.480]  Exactly.
[01:37:43.480 --> 01:37:48.120]  So yeah, so we, you know, we did the studies and actually people, if there's better food
[01:37:48.120 --> 01:37:49.640]  available, people would take the better food.
[01:37:50.280 --> 01:37:50.520]  Yes.
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:53.880]  We've done the studies, the research is out there.
[01:37:53.880 --> 01:37:59.320]  It's not just like the people are somehow inclined to wanting bad food or something.
[01:37:59.320 --> 01:38:02.360]  It's sort of set up like that, of course.
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:08.520]  So one thing we're working on is actually creating an enterprise in some way so that
[01:38:08.520 --> 01:38:10.520]  we can create an alternative.
[01:38:10.520 --> 01:38:14.440]  People can get their education, they can get the juice cleanses, because one thing you
[01:38:14.440 --> 01:38:19.880]  got to do, and I like some of the advertising I heard on the radio, on the breaks, is that
[01:38:19.880 --> 01:38:22.280]  we got to get the system out of our system.
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:27.480]  So we have to detox the system, detox all these things that are sort of attracting all
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:28.280]  these situations.
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:29.480]  It's actually also the violence.
[01:38:29.480 --> 01:38:33.080]  You spoke up on that, and I think that's a really valid point.
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:38.120]  One thing around, obviously, you know, there's obviously connections between food and behavior
[01:38:39.240 --> 01:38:44.520]  that's been thoroughly documented, and we can't put it, and obviously we've seen, you
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:45.800]  know, chemical warfare.
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:49.000]  The same people pumping in energy modified food have been part of the chemical warfare
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.240]  campaign all around the world, so.
[01:38:51.240 --> 01:38:53.960]  Yeah, well food is a chemical warfare delivery system.
[01:38:54.920 --> 01:38:56.280]  Right, right, exactly.
[01:38:56.280 --> 01:39:00.120]  So, you know, we totally wanted to point that out and do it in a way that has some humor
[01:39:00.120 --> 01:39:01.800]  in it so people can actually swallow it down.
[01:39:02.360 --> 01:39:02.860]  Yeah.
[01:39:03.480 --> 01:39:08.680]  And energy create, you know, and just encourage people, because I know a lot of people wake
[01:39:08.680 --> 01:39:14.760]  up to this stuff and want to make sure that folks knew that we had their back, and obviously
[01:39:14.760 --> 01:39:19.640]  at this point we're creating more organization around it, as we're building more teammates.
[01:39:19.640 --> 01:39:24.040]  Yeah, and what's a website where people can, I'm sorry, but what website can people go
[01:39:24.040 --> 01:39:27.400]  to to learn more about the curriculum and everything else that follows the video?
[01:39:27.400 --> 01:39:28.200]  What's the site?
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:28.920]  Yeah, exactly.
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:30.680]  SOSjuice.com.
[01:39:30.680 --> 01:39:31.960]  SOSjuice.com.
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:33.960]  SOSjuice.com, yeah.
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:35.320]  Power to people.
[01:39:35.320 --> 01:39:37.320]  And it's been amazing to see the curriculum, too.
[01:39:37.320 --> 01:39:41.960]  I mean, because Vanessa Carter, a teammate, came on and said, you know what, she works
[01:39:41.960 --> 01:39:46.120]  at an arsenal arts and ecology center, and they do, they have someone of the oldest,
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:52.200]  in Reagan, California, the oldest organic farm in California, and she works as a school
[01:39:52.200 --> 01:39:57.080]  teacher, and she works with, you know, creating community school gardens.
[01:39:57.080 --> 01:39:57.320]  Yeah.
[01:39:57.320 --> 01:40:00.760]  Okay, the curriculum, and we've got more people studying curriculum, so we, you know,
[01:40:00.760 --> 01:40:04.440]  the first line of this movement is obviously going to be education, you know, so we've
[01:40:04.440 --> 01:40:08.280]  got to pay awareness to education, and then we can start mobilizing people in certain
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:09.640]  ways after that.
[01:40:10.200 --> 01:40:14.680]  But if people want to be a part of the team, you know, or that idea, we actually pay more
[01:40:14.680 --> 01:40:19.160]  people around us to actually build all that communication, so we can do it in an organized
[01:40:19.160 --> 01:40:23.160]  fashion, we here at the Rainbow Warriors are like here, and let's get it done.
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:27.400]  Well, I love the message, I love what you're doing there, I love how you've chosen this
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:32.760]  path of spiritual truth instead of just the typical commercially driven, you know, gangster
[01:40:32.760 --> 01:40:37.400]  rap, whatever that we see coming out of so many artists who take that path, you've chosen
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:41.000]  a path of enlightenment, you know, a path of spiritual truth.
[01:40:41.720 --> 01:40:46.600]  I also want to share this with you, you know, we've covered and documented how the medical
[01:40:46.600 --> 01:40:52.360]  system specifically targets African Americans for more disease, especially more cancer,
[01:40:52.360 --> 01:40:57.480]  did you know that, for example, breast cancer is more aggressive in African American women
[01:40:57.480 --> 01:40:58.600]  than in white women?
[01:40:58.600 --> 01:40:59.640]  Did you know that?
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:00.520]  Right, right.
[01:41:00.520 --> 01:41:06.680]  And they won't tell those women why, and the reason is because of the vitamin D deficiency.
[01:41:06.680 --> 01:41:11.320]  They did a big study in Chicago, they had, I think, 300 nurses and medical professionals
[01:41:11.320 --> 01:41:15.400]  study this a couple years ago, and at the end of the study, they concluded they don't
[01:41:15.400 --> 01:41:20.600]  know why, they don't know why it's worse in black women than white women, and the answer
[01:41:20.600 --> 01:41:22.600]  is right in front of us, it's nutrition.
[01:41:22.600 --> 01:41:27.240]  And the African American community is not being told that they need to take vitamin
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:32.920]  D because they're getting the deficiency compared to white people who can absorb more sunlight
[01:41:32.920 --> 01:41:38.760]  because of the skin pigmentation, and so black men have more aggressive prostate cancer,
[01:41:38.760 --> 01:41:42.120]  and they're not being told, it's a crime.
[01:41:42.120 --> 01:41:47.800]  Right, well, this is great, I mean, that's why I love, you know, I think Alex Jones,
[01:41:47.800 --> 01:41:53.000]  you know, every now and then, a health ranger, I pick up on national news, and yeah, I mean,
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:57.320]  information, I mean, it's information aid, I mean, definitely just keep sharing that,
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:42:00.120]  I mean, it's a lot for me to learn, it's a lot for the public to learn, and just hope
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:05.960]  everyone just has an open mind and do their own research as well so we can get, especially
[01:42:05.960 --> 01:42:09.320]  all the educators, the one thing that was really empowering about this project is that
[01:42:09.320 --> 01:42:12.920]  we put up the curriculum, and a lot of educators are on it, and they're actually teaching it
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:17.320]  in their schools, and actually in correctional facilities, so if the environment's on media
[01:42:17.320 --> 01:42:21.000]  here, it's seeing a lot of people watching the video, they send pictures back of them
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:25.960]  actually discussing this stuff, so yeah, get the information out there, definitely.
[01:42:25.960 --> 01:42:29.640]  That's amazing, so what's next for you then?
[01:42:29.640 --> 01:42:32.120]  I mean, this project is already a success.
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:36.760]  I think your first YouTube video goal was only a few thousand views.
[01:42:36.760 --> 01:42:39.400]  You hit that in no time now.
[01:42:39.400 --> 01:42:41.560]  Is it up to 100,000 yet now?
[01:42:41.560 --> 01:42:44.280]  Yeah, I think it's at 100,000 right now, maybe like four days.
[01:42:44.280 --> 01:42:45.560]  Awesome.
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:50.840]  Again, that's a combination of the artistry and the attention, but for all the artists
[01:42:50.840 --> 01:42:56.040]  out there, really doing the research, really connecting with the earth and connecting with
[01:42:56.040 --> 01:42:59.320]  the heart of the people and the heart of the universe, really actually saying like, yo,
[01:42:59.320 --> 01:43:06.040]  we want to deliver something to actually speak to people on a cellular level, and the intention
[01:43:06.040 --> 01:43:11.000]  actually played out, so to me, it's a sort of validation, and I think where we're going
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:16.840]  with it, essentially, we have no choice at this point, because we have the energy to
[01:43:16.840 --> 01:43:23.960]  do it and the feel around us to do it based on the impact of the video is actually to
[01:43:23.960 --> 01:43:31.080]  create more curriculum, do more of the education, but also, we got the Indiegogo going for SOS
[01:43:31.080 --> 01:43:36.120]  and we're raising the money right now to actually practice non-profit, for-profit, hybrid, such
[01:43:36.120 --> 01:43:41.720]  that when people who are coming, probably most likely coming home from minor drug offenses,
[01:43:41.720 --> 01:43:47.480]  who are getting long sentences based on race and class, when they come back to the system,
[01:43:47.480 --> 01:43:50.920]  we don't want them to be better criminals and useless to society.
[01:43:50.920 --> 01:43:57.400]  We want to pick them up, educate them, hire them, and have them be in work with this SOS
[01:43:57.400 --> 01:43:59.160]  juice thing that we're pumping out.
[01:43:59.160 --> 01:44:00.160]  Excellent.
[01:44:00.160 --> 01:44:03.800]  We want to get people to earth and to the body, because the smoothies, the herbal licks
[01:44:03.800 --> 01:44:08.000]  and that's actually the medicine that people need so they can be strong to actually-
[01:44:08.000 --> 01:44:11.040]  I love how you're teaching people to grow food, too.
[01:44:11.040 --> 01:44:15.900]  I think that's so crucial, and that's an issue of freedom for everybody across America.
[01:44:15.900 --> 01:44:20.320]  This is why we cover farm freedom, the farms are being suppressed, the food is being suppressed.
[01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:26.920]  We interviewed in the last hour a dairy farmer in Missouri who had his cheese outlawed because
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:33.240]  the government contaminated it and then blamed him for it, but if we get down to the issue
[01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:39.920]  of justice here, justice means people having the freedom to live their lives in the way
[01:44:39.920 --> 01:44:45.280]  they see fit as long as they don't harm others in the process, and justice means you got
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:48.600]  to have freedom to have justice.
[01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:51.280]  If you don't have freedom, you can't have justice.
[01:44:51.280 --> 01:44:57.680]  So growing your own food is actually an act of resistance against the corporate controllers.
[01:44:57.680 --> 01:44:58.680]  Definitely.
[01:44:58.680 --> 01:45:00.680]  Well, any other-
[01:45:00.680 --> 01:45:08.000]  I mean, that's absolutely right, and that's what some of the education we're doing, it's
[01:45:08.000 --> 01:45:09.000]  something empowering.
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:13.200]  One thing we also realize is that young people and people in general, when you actually grow
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:15.400]  your food, you're more likely to eat it.
[01:45:15.400 --> 01:45:16.400]  That's right.
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:17.400]  Yeah.
[01:45:17.400 --> 01:45:22.920]  The food is very strategic and actually marks the check off of so many different areas that
[01:45:22.920 --> 01:45:24.920]  it's a must.
[01:45:24.920 --> 01:45:28.040]  And seed-taving is along the heirloom seed.
[01:45:28.040 --> 01:45:32.360]  I mean, these things are revolutionary right now.
[01:45:32.360 --> 01:45:37.000]  I mean, these things have come in place in the past, but the one thing I borrow inspiration
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:41.720]  from is the Black Panther Party, you know, Black Panthers and their family and stuff
[01:45:41.720 --> 01:45:42.720]  like that.
[01:45:42.720 --> 01:45:46.600]  I also borrowed inspiration from the indigenous community, the indigenous ceremony, people
[01:45:46.600 --> 01:45:50.240]  who have been living close to the earth and doing this for a long time, but one thing
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:54.560]  the Black Panther Party did was they had a free breakfast program, you know, and that's
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:58.520]  really when the government started looking at it and like, wow, this is actually embarrassing.
[01:45:58.520 --> 01:46:04.360]  We had this whole going cell protein going and actually providing resources for the community,
[01:46:04.360 --> 01:46:09.200]  sticker cell clinics, et cetera, and this was the 2013 version of that.
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:13.040]  Really, you know, when you grow your food, you got that seed and it's the same amount
[01:46:13.040 --> 01:46:18.320]  of power and that seed is the same amount of power, the energy is multiple nuclear bombs.
[01:46:18.320 --> 01:46:23.080]  So it's trying to reframe the conversation around what power is, you know, what freedom
[01:46:23.080 --> 01:46:27.600]  actually is when you liberate it in your body and you actually can, you know, so that's
[01:46:27.600 --> 01:46:28.600]  what we do.
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:29.600]  So it's not just the food.
[01:46:29.600 --> 01:46:35.800]  We do the meditation, the yoga, anything that keeps people clear and keep people on purpose
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:40.720]  with the highest that they need to operate in this lifetime, we want to provide facility
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:41.720]  for that.
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:47.280]  That sounds like a really healthy daily habit there to do that.
[01:46:47.280 --> 01:46:53.280]  Now, I don't, you know, I don't know a lot of history about the Black Panther Party itself,
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:47:00.320]  but what I do know is that American history is full of groups being suppressed and oppressed,
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:04.200]  including, you know, the American Indians, including right now veterans being oppressed
[01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:06.000]  and suppressed by the government.
[01:47:06.000 --> 01:47:10.360]  What I know is that government never wants any people to be free and what government
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:13.300]  does is it switches from one group to another.
[01:47:13.300 --> 01:47:17.520]  So it might have been black people in one era and then it's southerners and then it's
[01:47:17.520 --> 01:47:21.280]  veterans and then in the future it could be Latinos, it could be anybody, they just change
[01:47:21.280 --> 01:47:23.200]  the targets basically.
[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:26.080]  But the system is always a system of oppression.
[01:47:26.080 --> 01:47:30.240]  So that's why I support freedom and justice in whatever form it is from where, you know,
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:32.900]  from wherever it comes out of the culture.
[01:47:32.900 --> 01:47:37.760]  That's what I support is individual freedom and that's what I see you singing about.
[01:47:37.760 --> 01:47:39.560]  So I commend you for this song.
[01:47:39.560 --> 01:47:40.560]  It's amazing.
[01:47:40.560 --> 01:47:41.560]  Yeah.
[01:47:41.560 --> 01:47:44.080]  Thank you for promoting it and posting it.
[01:47:44.080 --> 01:47:45.080]  Yeah.
[01:47:45.080 --> 01:47:46.840]  It's my pleasure to do so and I hope we see more from you too.
[01:47:46.840 --> 01:47:52.700]  I hope you stay on this track and put out some more music and videos that speaks to
[01:47:52.700 --> 01:47:57.240]  this spiritual truth and this war of resistance against the food poisoners.
[01:47:57.240 --> 01:47:58.240]  Yeah, definitely.
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:48:03.720]  I mean, go to earthamplified.com and we have songs about water, I mean, people talking
[01:48:03.720 --> 01:48:08.720]  about oil, but you know, we might move on to water next and talk more about that too.
[01:48:08.720 --> 01:48:09.720]  It's huge.
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:10.720]  I mean, Florida and the water.
[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:13.240]  I mean, it's so much for water.
[01:48:13.240 --> 01:48:14.240]  That's right.
[01:48:14.240 --> 01:48:15.240]  It's like, wow.
[01:48:15.240 --> 01:48:16.240]  We may have to move.
[01:48:16.240 --> 01:48:17.240]  So we know full water.
[01:48:17.240 --> 01:48:18.240]  We're dealing with the basic, you know.
[01:48:18.240 --> 01:48:22.960]  Well, you know, one thing that's really interesting, if you take, I found that African Americans
[01:48:22.960 --> 01:48:26.400]  are really well informed on the dangers of vaccines and they will, they will say no to
[01:48:26.400 --> 01:48:29.240]  vaccines more than a typical group of white folks.
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:32.840]  If you, if you have a hundred white folks in a room and you have a hundred African Americans
[01:48:32.840 --> 01:48:35.340]  in a room and you say, who wants a vaccine?
[01:48:35.340 --> 01:48:38.600]  It's the white folks that raise their hands, me, me, me, I'll take the vaccine and all
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:42.000]  the black folks are like, um, I might want to think twice about that.
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:47.400]  I find that very interesting because they've learned to not trust the lies coming out of
[01:48:47.400 --> 01:48:48.400]  medicine.
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:49.400]  Do you, do you see that as well?
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:50.400]  Yeah.
[01:48:50.400 --> 01:48:55.400]  I mean, we've had African American history, you look at the history, I mean, it's like,
[01:48:55.400 --> 01:49:04.080]  you know, the Tuskegee experiment, you know, illegal, uh, sort of like, you know, poisoning
[01:49:04.080 --> 01:49:05.080]  of people.
[01:49:05.080 --> 01:49:06.080]  Yeah.
[01:49:06.080 --> 01:49:08.080]  The medical experiments, man, the Tuskegee experiments, all that.
[01:49:08.080 --> 01:49:09.080]  Yeah.
[01:49:09.080 --> 01:49:13.080]  There's been, yeah, there's been a lot of, uh, a lot of like sort of distrust, you know,
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:15.080]  and rightfully so on some levels.
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:18.080]  And I think that like, you know, that's probably what that's coming out of.
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:23.080]  I mean, I mean, that's obviously is a heated debate and around that, but you know, me personally,
[01:49:23.080 --> 01:49:28.080]  I mean, I think I'm a half of myself, you know, I, I haven't, I say my, my son, you
[01:49:28.080 --> 01:49:32.080]  know, I'm not necessarily on that tip and I've done a lot of research on it.
[01:49:32.080 --> 01:49:33.080]  Good for you.
[01:49:33.080 --> 01:49:38.760]  I could do that research, but, um, yeah, you know, I mean, I think, you know, when people
[01:49:38.760 --> 01:49:43.080]  get the information, um, they make healthier choices.
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:48.760]  So education, you know, have people change people's consciousness, shift people's consciousness.
[01:49:48.760 --> 01:49:52.280]  People really get into a space where they actually, and then we deal with the spiritual
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:57.040]  aspect too, so that people can find that sovereignty within and at the end of the day outward.
[01:49:57.040 --> 01:50:01.920]  So we do it in an inside movement, inside outward and outside in as well, being aware
[01:50:01.920 --> 01:50:03.200]  of what's going on.
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:04.200]  Well, you're right.
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:07.960]  The transformation starts from the inside and then it moves outside.
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:08.960]  You're you're, you've nailed it.
[01:50:08.960 --> 01:50:09.960]  You're exactly right.
[01:50:09.960 --> 01:50:11.680]  We've only got about a minute left with Yasha.
[01:50:11.680 --> 01:50:16.320]  Um, any final thoughts before we wrap this up and, and, uh, also I want to thank you
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:18.880]  in advance for being on the show today, but final thoughts.
[01:50:18.880 --> 01:50:24.840]  Yeah, just, you know, just thinking, uh, Earth Amplified, JBLAST, the whole crew, the Brooklyn
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:29.920]  crew, the Oakland community, and Biggle solid Foo Fighters worldwide, Vandana Shiva, um,
[01:50:29.920 --> 01:50:34.480]  all amazing, beautiful, noble souls that we around within this time who are actually standing
[01:50:34.480 --> 01:50:35.480]  up for truth and light.
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:40.240]  Um, may it be so, and may we go onward.
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:41.240]  Amen to that.
[01:50:41.240 --> 01:50:45.200]  Thank you for your contribution to this, to this fight for food justice.
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:46.200]  Thank you for what you do.
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:47.200]  Thank you for being who you are.
[01:50:47.200 --> 01:50:52.560]  I, I, uh, I really, really was inspired by your video and I want to encourage everybody
[01:50:52.560 --> 01:50:54.200]  out there to go, go check it out.
[01:50:54.200 --> 01:50:56.560]  Food Fight by Seasons.
[01:50:56.560 --> 01:50:57.560]  Check it out.
[01:50:57.560 --> 01:50:58.560]  Spread the word.
[01:50:58.560 --> 01:50:59.560]  It's good stuff.
[01:50:59.560 --> 01:51:03.080]  All right, your freedoms are on the line.
[01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:04.920]  The second amendment is in danger.
[01:51:04.920 --> 01:51:09.000]  How soon before your freedoms are taken away, what can you not live without?
[01:51:09.000 --> 01:51:10.640]  What is your greatest dependency?
[01:51:10.640 --> 01:51:11.640]  Is it your guns?
[01:51:11.640 --> 01:51:12.640]  Is it your home?
[01:51:12.640 --> 01:51:14.000]  No, it's food.
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:16.120]  It all boils down to the food supply.
[01:51:16.120 --> 01:51:19.840]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[01:51:19.840 --> 01:51:20.840]  Don't be dependent.
[01:51:20.840 --> 01:51:22.120]  Be self-sufficient.
[01:51:22.120 --> 01:51:23.720]  Don't wait for the government to feed you.
[01:51:23.720 --> 01:51:24.720]  Feed yourself.
[01:51:24.720 --> 01:51:26.960]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.

[01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:03.600]  Answer this.
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:08.140]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup fakes up burglars into thinking
[01:53:08.140 --> 01:53:13.080]  someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended
[01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:17.200]  by many police departments and sells for less than $35?
[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:19.280]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[01:53:19.280 --> 01:53:23.660]  This year about one in every 50 U.S. homes will have a break in with burglars usually
[01:53:23.660 --> 01:53:28.120]  picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[01:53:28.120 --> 01:53:33.020]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching
[01:53:33.020 --> 01:53:36.100]  TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[01:53:36.100 --> 01:53:41.920]  It's like a lamp on a timer but far more convincing and for only $34.95, fake TV could be the
[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:46.120]  difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.

[01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:57.280]  That's 877-532-5388 or go to Faketv.com.
[01:53:57.280 --> 01:54:16.720]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.
[01:54:16.720 --> 01:54:18.600]  Yeah we're back here on the Alex Jones Show.
[01:54:18.600 --> 01:54:20.160]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:54:20.160 --> 01:54:25.840]  This is Mike Adams, Health Ranger filling in today.
[01:54:25.840 --> 01:54:31.360]  Yeah and this is my final segment today because the next hour we feature an interview with
[01:54:31.360 --> 01:54:32.880]  Immortal Technique.
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:37.760]  That's Alex Jones and Immortal Technique coming up in just a few minutes so you don't want
[01:54:37.760 --> 01:54:38.760]  to miss that.
[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:43.280]  It's interesting, we're talking to a lot of musical artists because they have such passion
[01:54:43.280 --> 01:54:48.560]  for justice and for truth across the board.
[01:54:48.560 --> 01:54:49.560]  I think it's great.
[01:54:49.560 --> 01:54:55.640]  And by the way, you might ask, well how come I'm not covering all of the police state news?
[01:54:55.640 --> 01:55:01.840]  I am going to cover more news here but the bottom line is Alex gets that topic nailed.
[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:06.800]  My job is to come in here and cover a little bit of different things of what's going on
[01:55:06.800 --> 01:55:13.760]  out there from the world of health, from the world of food and GMOs and just to bring in
[01:55:13.760 --> 01:55:17.920]  some different angles of what I'm seeing out there because I don't come in here and try
[01:55:17.920 --> 01:55:20.000]  to be Alex.
[01:55:20.000 --> 01:55:26.000]  I come in here with my own take on what's happening and from my experience as the Health
[01:55:26.000 --> 01:55:27.400]  Ranger and so on.
[01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:31.680]  And by the way, along those lines, check out infowarsstore.com, we've got the Health Ranger
[01:55:31.680 --> 01:55:34.560]  lineup right there in the store today for the first time.
[01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:38.440]  This is the milestone day and we're going to be supplying Infowars store with all the
[01:55:38.440 --> 01:55:43.200]  Health Ranger select products from here forward so you can support Infowars and stay healthy
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:48.720]  with the cleanest food, so clean, super foods, turmeric supplements, the only stuff that
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:52.280]  I'm willing to put my name on, that's what we produce.
[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:55.360]  This is actually produced right here in Texas, I don't mean it's grown in Texas, I mean it's
[01:55:55.360 --> 01:55:59.840]  packaged in a certified organic facility that we put together out here.
[01:55:59.840 --> 01:56:05.320]  Also the Infowars magazine, the next issue is now out, the newest issue, Civil War II
[01:56:05.320 --> 01:56:09.520]  on the cover and it's got an American flag on the cover, check out the magazine, get
[01:56:09.520 --> 01:56:11.600]  yourself a subscription.
[01:56:11.600 --> 01:56:16.240]  This thing is loaded with great information, the layout is amazing, the artists who are
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:22.680]  involved with this, the layout artists, this is a blast to read and it's super educational,
[01:56:22.680 --> 01:56:29.600]  it's got some great sponsors, so check out that magazine, subscribe at infowarsstore.com.
[01:56:29.600 --> 01:56:34.320]  I'm going to take one home with me actually, hot off the presses here man, that's one of
[01:56:34.320 --> 01:56:39.200]  the little fringe benefits of filling in for Alex is I get my hands on these magazines
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:42.720]  faster than most other people, so that's fun.
[01:56:42.720 --> 01:56:47.240]  Here's some other news that's breaking right now, Paul Joseph Watson's story up at infowars.com,
[01:56:47.240 --> 01:56:50.820]  DHS censors information about firearms purchases.
[01:56:50.820 --> 01:56:57.480]  You know how we reported that DHS was purchasing 7,000 full auto assault rifles for their immigration
[01:56:57.480 --> 01:57:03.600]  and customs enforcement project, right, give me a break, I need 7,000 assault rifles to
[01:57:03.600 --> 01:57:06.280]  deal with immigrants, really?
[01:57:06.280 --> 01:57:11.120]  Anyway they started blacking out the numbers of rifles that they're purchasing now because
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:15.800]  I guess they got tired of Paul Joseph Watson monitoring their bids and finding out that
[01:57:15.800 --> 01:57:21.340]  they're purchasing 2 billion rounds of ammo and 7,000 assault rifles and so on, so they're
[01:57:21.340 --> 01:57:22.940]  blacking out the numbers.
[01:57:22.940 --> 01:57:27.360]  Next item, gun registration, criminals are exempt.
[01:57:27.360 --> 01:57:40.040]  This is an article from James Wesley Rawls, man, that's what happens when I shoot 50 cows
[01:57:40.040 --> 01:57:46.360]  next to Alex and Shane, I get a little head concussion and then I screw things up.
[01:57:46.360 --> 01:57:48.360]  It's from survivalblog.com.
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:55.760]  James Wesley Rawls, one absurdity of gun registration, criminals are exempt, and it's true, Supreme
[01:57:55.760 --> 01:58:00.760]  Court decision says that criminals do not have to comply, in fact are forbidden from
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:06.360]  complying with gun registration laws because of the Fifth Amendment and the protection
[01:58:06.360 --> 01:58:08.520]  against self-incrimination.
[01:58:08.520 --> 01:58:13.280]  So the best way to not have to register your firearms is to become a criminal, according
[01:58:13.280 --> 01:58:15.640]  to the Supreme Court.
[01:58:15.640 --> 01:58:17.080]  How crazy does it get?
[01:58:17.080 --> 01:58:22.160]  All right, well folks, that's about it for me today, but Alex Jones coming up next with
[01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:27.400]  Immortal Technique, an hour-long special interview broadcasting next, and I'll be hosting Infowars
[01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:33.880]  Nightly News tonight with some breaking news, and Jim Mars is our guest, so don't miss that.
[01:58:33.880 --> 01:58:37.280]  Thank you for joining us today, it's been a pleasure being here, and I'll be on next
[01:58:37.280 --> 01:58:39.000]  week with more news.
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.000]  Take care.
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:51.320]  You are listening to GCN, visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:52.800]  Your freedoms are on the line.
[01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:54.640]  The Second Amendment is in danger.
[01:58:54.640 --> 01:58:57.000]  How soon before your freedoms are taken away?
[01:58:57.000 --> 01:58:58.720]  What can you not live without?
[01:58:58.720 --> 01:59:00.360]  What is your greatest dependency?
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:01.360]  Is it your guns?
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:02.360]  Is it your home?
[01:59:02.360 --> 01:59:03.720]  No, it's food.
[01:59:03.720 --> 01:59:05.840]  It all boils down to the food supply.
[01:59:05.840 --> 01:59:09.560]  The radical governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[01:59:09.560 --> 01:59:10.560]  Don't be dependent.
[01:59:10.560 --> 01:59:11.840]  Be self-sufficient.
[01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:13.440]  Don't wait for the government to feed you.
[01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:14.440]  Feed yourself.
[01:59:14.440 --> 01:59:16.680]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[01:59:16.680 --> 01:59:20.280]  Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from eFoods Direct.
[01:59:20.280 --> 01:59:23.040]  It's the best long-term, storable food on the planet.

[01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:56.080]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.080 --> 02:00:00.960]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:00.960 --> 02:00:04.800]  Purpose of life is a life with a purpose, so I'd rather die for cause than live a life
[02:00:04.800 --> 02:00:05.800]  that is worthless.
[02:00:05.800 --> 02:00:06.800]  Big brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[02:00:06.800 --> 02:00:13.960]  People can't hear me because I say it through hip-hop, and no matter what the venue is,
[02:00:13.960 --> 02:00:19.480]  they'll still think hip-hop, irresponsible, arrogant young people, or they'll hear you
[02:00:19.480 --> 02:00:24.800]  say something and they'll say, oh, man, I love this guy, but he went crazy on Piers
[02:00:24.800 --> 02:00:29.040]  and I don't think that he should represent the movement that way.
[02:00:29.040 --> 02:00:34.760]  At some point, you and I will only touch a fraction of the people that we need to speak
[02:00:34.760 --> 02:00:39.720]  to, and yet I think that what's important about it is to have so many diverse groups
[02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:43.960]  of individuals who have the same core message.
[02:00:43.960 --> 02:00:45.600]  What's behind the mask?
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:51.920]  The mortal technique, one of, or if not the most successful independent rappers or hip-hop
[02:00:51.920 --> 02:00:56.960]  stars in the world, millions and millions of downloads, hundreds of thousands of CDs
[02:00:56.960 --> 02:00:58.780]  back when they still had that.
[02:00:58.780 --> 02:01:06.520]  Here today in Austin, Texas, to talk about The Martyr, his new CD, very powerful music,
[02:01:06.520 --> 02:01:12.040]  and a new film he's got coming out with some pretty big heavy hitters, and so, but he goes
[02:01:12.040 --> 02:01:13.040]  by tech.
[02:01:13.040 --> 02:01:18.840]  A mortal technique is here in studio with us with the beautiful Barrett 50 Cal.
[02:01:18.840 --> 02:01:20.800]  Let's start with, I said, what do you wanna cover first?
[02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:21.800]  You said guns.
[02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:24.400]  I said, hey, grab the 50 Cal out of the safe.
[02:01:24.400 --> 02:01:28.720]  So that's why the 50 Cal is here on the table, specifically, Second Amendment.
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:30.240]  Tell me where you stand on that.
[02:01:30.240 --> 02:01:32.280]  You're never gonna ban guns in this country.
[02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:33.280]  You know what I mean?
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:36.200]  I mean, you can read the Dick Act of 1902.
[02:01:36.200 --> 02:01:41.320]  We're talking about it being against the Constitution for them to do that.
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:44.880]  Did people misuse this as a tool?
[02:01:44.880 --> 02:01:46.080]  Yes.
[02:01:46.080 --> 02:01:48.840]  Did someone try to blow themselves up on a plane?
[02:01:48.840 --> 02:01:50.000]  Yes.
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:55.360]  Whether it was a shoe bomber or a guy with a grenade strapped to his underwear, we all
[02:01:55.360 --> 02:01:59.680]  have to go through a screening now because of that.
[02:01:59.680 --> 02:02:06.720]  And do I agree with people being screened and having to have some sort of mental capacity
[02:02:06.720 --> 02:02:08.360]  to own a weapon like this?
[02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:09.920]  Yes, absolutely.
[02:02:09.920 --> 02:02:17.040]  However, I always tell people that before we get into an alarmist position, if the government
[02:02:17.040 --> 02:02:20.880]  wants to attack you, for example, people in New York, I tell them, they don't have to
[02:02:20.880 --> 02:02:22.480]  take away your guns.
[02:02:22.480 --> 02:02:24.580]  They can just turn the water off.
[02:02:24.580 --> 02:02:27.640]  Can the average person in New York drink out of the Hudson?
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:29.840]  Can they drink out of the East River?
[02:02:29.840 --> 02:02:32.800]  No, they control every other resource about you.
[02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:34.600]  And that's why they want you so dependent.
[02:02:34.600 --> 02:02:37.640]  Guns are kind of the vestigial sign of one of the last freedoms we've got and I could
[02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:41.400]  go to the issues of- No, no, no, also my, not to interrupt you,
[02:02:41.400 --> 02:02:46.180]  my big shout out to my friend Dave Gomez, Chief Warrant Officer.
[02:02:46.180 --> 02:02:55.340]  We had this conversation and I said, what good would light arms like an AR-15 be against
[02:02:55.340 --> 02:02:58.880]  a division of heavily armored troops that came in?
[02:02:58.880 --> 02:03:01.660]  In other words, what good would your pea shooters be?
[02:03:01.660 --> 02:03:06.240]  And he said to me, it's working really well for those people in Afghanistan.
[02:03:06.240 --> 02:03:08.240]  They don't have advanced weaponry.
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:09.960]  It's the willingness to die.
[02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:11.160]  It's the willingness to resist.
[02:03:11.160 --> 02:03:15.180]  Look how frightened they were of a guy like Chris Dorner.
[02:03:15.180 --> 02:03:20.260]  One man, regardless of whether you or I think that story is true or the public does, one
[02:03:20.260 --> 02:03:24.820]  man, he wasn't armed with bazookas and tanks.
[02:03:24.820 --> 02:03:29.460]  The police were so scared, they shot up multiple innocent people, were hyperventilating in
[02:03:29.460 --> 02:03:34.920]  fear and then said, we're gonna burn it down, burned it down, and then told us you didn't
[02:03:34.920 --> 02:03:35.920]  hear that.
[02:03:35.920 --> 02:03:40.640]  And anyone that would dare to question whether the government was corrupt or not, or whether
[02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:45.800]  his position was right, is automatically painted as if they support murder, right?
[02:03:45.800 --> 02:03:51.560]  The reality is this, when you kill someone without due process, that's murder.
[02:03:51.560 --> 02:03:54.480]  The cops basically went in there and murdered him.
[02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:56.320]  Did he murder people?
[02:03:56.320 --> 02:03:57.320]  Absolutely.
[02:03:57.320 --> 02:03:58.600]  Was he wrong for that?
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:03:59.600]  Yes.
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:00.960]  Did they want him alive?
[02:04:00.960 --> 02:04:06.160]  No, because if they got him alive and he stood trial, I think it would have been the end
[02:04:06.160 --> 02:04:07.160]  of it.
[02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:09.720]  I think that people would have been like, are you kidding me?
[02:04:09.720 --> 02:04:15.120]  Is this guy about to blow the lid on how fascist this system has become, on how people have
[02:04:15.120 --> 02:04:16.900]  been trained to think this way?
[02:04:16.900 --> 02:04:22.120]  And I know we always talk about Nazi Germany, but the Germans were not animals, Alex.
[02:04:22.120 --> 02:04:23.680]  They were human beings.
[02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:25.380]  They were conditioned.
[02:04:25.380 --> 02:04:29.800]  When you read the stories of the SS officers that were given a puppy, you know what I mean,
[02:04:29.800 --> 02:04:32.160]  to have during their time in the academy.
[02:04:32.160 --> 02:04:33.280]  Then they had to kill it.
[02:04:33.280 --> 02:04:36.640]  And the last order is, shoot the puppy in the head.
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:42.480]  Unflinching absolute loyalty, unquestioning to what they think is the republic, to what
[02:04:42.480 --> 02:04:46.920]  they think is what is supposed to be the- And it was done by increments, just like we've
[02:04:46.920 --> 02:04:48.560]  become so evil by increment.
[02:04:48.560 --> 02:04:51.980]  A little bit more, a little bit more, rationalize, give in to it.
[02:04:51.980 --> 02:05:01.120]  And pretty soon.
[02:05:01.120 --> 02:05:04.520]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms.
[02:05:04.520 --> 02:05:08.480]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your
[02:05:08.480 --> 02:05:09.960]  arsenal for home protection.
[02:05:09.960 --> 02:05:14.320]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[02:08:18.200 --> 02:08:32.720]  You know, it's interesting to be on this program because a lot of people will approach me and
[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:35.560]  they'll be like, I can't believe you're going to do this show.
[02:08:35.560 --> 02:08:41.200]  And I think that there are a lot of perceptions about yourself that that people have the wrong
[02:08:41.200 --> 02:08:42.360]  idea about.
[02:08:42.360 --> 02:08:46.520]  When people say to me, oh, Alex Jones, you mean the guy who talks like the micro machine
[02:08:46.520 --> 02:08:48.600]  man and puts all these dates and stuff into it?
[02:08:48.600 --> 02:08:54.880]  I say, listen, if you slow down what he's saying and you look literally one sentence
[02:08:54.880 --> 02:09:00.920]  by one sentence, you have 200 things to research within the span of that.
[02:09:00.920 --> 02:09:05.440]  And I think that sometimes what would benefit you is to slow it down and say, hey, man,
[02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:06.440]  you know what?
[02:09:06.440 --> 02:09:07.440]  Today we're just going to deal with this.
[02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:08.440]  No, I agree.
[02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:09.440]  But here's the problem.
[02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:10.440]  The way my brain works.
[02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:12.600]  I think most people actually work this way.
[02:09:12.600 --> 02:09:16.800]  Is that is that when people start like that, the problem is the way my brain moves, there's
[02:09:16.800 --> 02:09:19.300]  like a hundred different fact.
[02:09:19.300 --> 02:09:21.120]  What people think I'm talking fast.
[02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:25.640]  That's like one one hundredth because when I see something, I know all the connections
[02:09:25.640 --> 02:09:28.640]  and how it integrates because I've read all the establishment publications.
[02:09:28.640 --> 02:09:31.700]  And then I know the three or they're thinking like a three level chess.
[02:09:31.700 --> 02:09:35.800]  The general public's playing checkers and they want to keep us in a checkers level.
[02:09:35.800 --> 02:09:38.680]  And that's what's so frustrating is I can see their end game.
[02:09:38.680 --> 02:09:44.520]  You know, you're not one of these guys who came out and said the whole fascism started
[02:09:44.520 --> 02:09:46.200]  with the black guy crowd.
[02:09:46.200 --> 02:09:47.200]  You know what I mean?
[02:09:47.200 --> 02:09:51.080]  I remember you from the Bush administration days being out there saying, do you realize
[02:09:51.080 --> 02:09:53.080]  what's happening here in America?
[02:09:53.080 --> 02:09:56.980]  You know, you are looking at it through a right left paradigm is what you were saying
[02:09:56.980 --> 02:09:57.980]  to people.
[02:09:57.980 --> 02:10:00.740]  When in reality, it doesn't matter who's going to be there.
[02:10:00.740 --> 02:10:05.000]  Whoever comes after Bush is going to have to cross the T's and dot the I's.
[02:10:05.000 --> 02:10:06.000]  Well, no, that's it.
[02:10:06.000 --> 02:10:08.600]  Cynthia McKinney was on my show about a month ago.
[02:10:08.600 --> 02:10:09.600]  She's back on next week.
[02:10:09.600 --> 02:10:13.180]  The former congresswoman, for those that I'm sure most viewers know, she is.
[02:10:13.180 --> 02:10:16.720]  And she said, look, it's not that Barack Obama's the lesser of two evils.
[02:10:16.720 --> 02:10:21.720]  He's the more effective Mitt Romney would have done the exact same thing, but couldn't
[02:10:21.720 --> 02:10:24.040]  have gotten away with as much.
[02:10:24.040 --> 02:10:29.880]  And I think that, look, if someone else had been able to be in that position, smiling
[02:10:29.880 --> 02:10:35.760]  and then sending all of these troops and mercenaries back into Iraq, back into Afghanistan, exploiting
[02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:40.880]  the natural resources, deporting as many people as he did, which we'll get into later.
[02:10:40.880 --> 02:10:44.720]  I think that that would have garnered a lot more hatred if it had happened from a right
[02:10:44.720 --> 02:10:50.340]  wing Republican white guy, as opposed to someone who has the impression of being an incredibly
[02:10:50.340 --> 02:10:57.000]  liberal individual and yet follows a secretive agenda that really doesn't answer to anybody.
[02:10:57.000 --> 02:10:58.760]  All I can say is I'm a true independent.
[02:10:58.760 --> 02:11:02.640]  I tweeted earlier today and said, you know, two real independents, you're a real independent.
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:03.640]  You're not controlled.
[02:11:03.640 --> 02:11:07.880]  I mean, I think I first met you seven, eight years ago in New York and I've had a chance
[02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:11.200]  to be at a few of your events and you've been there at a showing of Endgame.
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:14.960]  And I just respect the fact that I agree with about 85% of what you stand for.
[02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:18.320]  And I probably agree with the other 15 if I fully understood it or had time to follow
[02:11:18.320 --> 02:11:19.320]  it all.
[02:11:19.320 --> 02:11:21.240]  But most of what I've heard you talk about, I agree with.
[02:11:21.240 --> 02:11:26.040]  But you're through a different prism, a different perspective, a different scanner darkly.
[02:11:26.040 --> 02:11:31.620]  Myself as well, my only issue is this, whatever the globalists are really pushing, it may
[02:11:31.620 --> 02:11:39.320]  have a bunch of good reasons and a cover story associated with it of why it sounds good.
[02:11:39.320 --> 02:11:43.880]  But I look at what their internal documents, leaked documents, what the larger end game
[02:11:43.880 --> 02:11:44.880]  is.
[02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:45.880]  Absolutely.
[02:11:45.880 --> 02:11:49.160]  And so I'm like, we can't open borders because the globalists want a North American union.
[02:11:49.160 --> 02:11:54.320]  They want to implode Mexico under 2021, force everybody off their land into maquiladoras,
[02:11:54.320 --> 02:11:58.080]  then up here to drive down wages, then to create a culture clash.
[02:11:58.080 --> 02:12:01.680]  See if the system was trying to unify things for everybody to be friends, it'd be different.
[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:06.160]  In the name of, quote, liberalism, they then sell it as, but I mean, it would take an hour
[02:12:06.160 --> 02:12:07.160]  to break the whole thing down.
[02:12:07.160 --> 02:12:08.160]  But we'll get into that.
[02:12:08.160 --> 02:12:16.320]  I think the reality is that people often misunderstand and misrepresent the mythology of America.
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:22.200]  For example, the creation of the United States in the fact that when Britain surrendered,
[02:12:22.200 --> 02:12:25.760]  it seeded a series of territories that didn't belong to them.
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:30.320]  When Mexico surrendered to the United States after the Mexican-American War, it seeded
[02:12:30.320 --> 02:12:33.480]  a series of territories that did not belong to them.
[02:12:33.480 --> 02:12:37.600]  All of these Native American tribes, they weren't ruled solely by Spain.
[02:12:37.600 --> 02:12:40.320]  As a matter of fact, Spain couldn't exercise control over them.
[02:12:40.320 --> 02:12:42.360]  The Mexican government couldn't exercise control.
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:43.360]  No, I agree.
[02:12:43.360 --> 02:12:47.820]  And then the other part of it becomes from when I hear people talk about who deserves
[02:12:47.820 --> 02:12:49.760]  to be here and who doesn't.
[02:12:49.760 --> 02:12:53.940]  Because I've met people who don't have papers legally, right?
[02:12:53.940 --> 02:12:56.600]  And yet they serve their country in Iraq and Afghanistan.
[02:12:56.600 --> 02:12:59.640]  Now, mind you, that's not a war that I necessarily believe in.
[02:12:59.640 --> 02:13:00.640]  But when I hear a bunch of-
[02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:01.640]  But it's hypocrisy.
[02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:05.680]  When I hear a bunch of chicken hawks saying, you're not down with America.
[02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:09.480]  I look at them and I say, hey, what did you ever do to be considered American besides
[02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:14.560]  fall out of some wretched hole in Kansas or New York or Texas?
[02:13:14.560 --> 02:13:19.020]  Here's a guy who barely speaks the language and yet he's putting his life on the line
[02:13:19.020 --> 02:13:21.240]  for the perceived safety of the United States.
[02:13:21.240 --> 02:13:24.640]  Now, regardless of whether you or I agree with the premise of the war-
[02:13:24.640 --> 02:13:25.920]  He's paid dues.
[02:13:25.920 --> 02:13:27.360]  Behind it, right, he's paid his dues.
[02:13:27.360 --> 02:13:28.360]  No, I get that.
[02:13:28.360 --> 02:13:35.020]  The people, if you're drinking orange juice out there, if you're wearing clothes that
[02:13:35.020 --> 02:13:39.000]  are made of cotton as opposed to hemp because they have to outlaw that.
[02:13:39.000 --> 02:13:43.280]  If you're eating strawberries in the winter, blueberries in the winter, that doesn't grow
[02:13:43.280 --> 02:13:44.280]  in the winter.
[02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:47.840]  It had to come from plantation-like atmospheres.
[02:13:47.840 --> 02:13:51.280]  We've overthrown governments overseas just to keep-
[02:13:51.280 --> 02:13:53.720]  I agree, globalism, neocolonialism.
[02:13:53.720 --> 02:13:56.160]  And it's tied into neoliberalism as well.
[02:13:56.160 --> 02:14:01.640]  The idea that everything's for sale, that the air's for sale, that the water's for sale.
[02:14:01.640 --> 02:14:05.360]  These people wanna privatize every aspect of human life.
[02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:11.000]  Whatever the establishment wants, you can bet it's not good for the general public.
[02:14:11.000 --> 02:14:12.400]  I don't care what color you are.
[02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:13.880]  I mean, here's an example.
[02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:19.240]  I like the immigrants that I know from Mexico, and they tend to be better family people,
[02:14:19.240 --> 02:14:21.240]  not decadent, spoiled brat Americans.
[02:14:21.240 --> 02:14:23.440]  I don't care what color the spoiled brat American is.
[02:14:23.440 --> 02:14:25.280]  We've had it good so long, they're spoiled brats.
[02:14:25.280 --> 02:14:28.760]  And that's an over stereotype, but there's some reality to it where there's smoker's
[02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:29.760]  fire.
[02:14:29.760 --> 02:14:34.320]  But then the Mexican government, if I go down there, will shake me down, beat me up, steal
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:35.320]  my car.
[02:14:35.320 --> 02:14:38.000]  I can't move down there and go have a baby paid for at the hospital.
[02:14:38.000 --> 02:14:39.720]  I can't get all this stuff free.
[02:14:39.720 --> 02:14:44.860]  And then I'm criticized up here by Mexico for how bad I am when Mexico has their most
[02:14:44.860 --> 02:14:48.440]  draconian anti-immigrant laws in all of Latin America.
[02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:52.720]  See, I'm just sick of always hearing inherently that America's bad.
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:59.280]  What's bad is this imperial global corporate British model that corporations have adopted
[02:14:59.280 --> 02:15:01.840]  that is now open source for these elites.
[02:15:01.840 --> 02:15:07.600]  I think though that what needs to happen in that conversation, cuz I love to read the
[02:15:07.600 --> 02:15:13.400]  criticisms of myself, not only because I find them funny and they're not true, but also
[02:15:13.400 --> 02:15:15.360]  because it gives me a chance to debunk these things.
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:16.360]  Me too, it's entertaining.
[02:15:16.360 --> 02:15:20.760]  When people say to me, Alex Jones, you mean the guy who talks like the micro machine man
[02:15:20.760 --> 02:15:22.600]  and puts all these dates and stuff into it?
[02:15:22.600 --> 02:15:28.840]  I say, listen, if you slow down what he's saying, and you look literally one sentence
[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:34.900]  by one sentence, you have 200 things to research within the span of that.
[02:15:34.900 --> 02:15:39.420]  And I think that sometimes what would benefit you is to slow it down and say, hey, man,
[02:15:39.420 --> 02:15:40.420]  you know what?
[02:15:40.420 --> 02:15:41.420]  Today we're just gonna deal with this.
[02:15:41.420 --> 02:15:45.080]  No, I agree, but here's the problem, the way my brain works, I think most people's actually
[02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:46.080]  work this way.
[02:15:46.080 --> 02:15:47.080]  Is that-
[02:15:47.080 --> 02:15:50.800]  I love when people start like that, the problem is the way my brain works.
[02:15:50.800 --> 02:15:55.100]  There's like a hundred different, in fact, what people think I'm talking fast, that's
[02:15:55.100 --> 02:15:56.100]  like 1,100th.
[02:15:56.100 --> 02:15:57.100]  Right.
[02:15:57.100 --> 02:16:00.520]  Because when I see something, I know all the connections and how it integrates, cuz I've
[02:16:00.520 --> 02:16:02.640]  read all the establishment publications.
[02:16:02.640 --> 02:16:06.280]  And then I know the three, they're thinking like a three level chess, the general public's
[02:16:06.280 --> 02:16:07.280]  playing checkers.
[02:16:07.280 --> 02:16:08.280]  Right.
[02:16:08.280 --> 02:16:11.760]  And they wanna keep us in a checkers level, and that's what's so frustrating is that I
[02:16:11.760 --> 02:16:12.760]  can see their end game.
[02:16:12.760 --> 02:16:16.680]  But listen, we talked for about five minutes, right when you got here, about some of the
[02:16:16.680 --> 02:16:19.200]  things we wanna talk about, and we're kinda hitting the end of it.
[02:16:19.200 --> 02:16:20.200]  Sure.
[02:16:20.200 --> 02:16:21.200]  At the start, but it's going awesome.
[02:16:21.200 --> 02:16:24.840]  In the limited time we've got with you, because I know you got a show to do, let's start with,
[02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:26.020]  I said, what do you wanna cover first?
[02:16:26.020 --> 02:16:27.020]  You said guns.
[02:16:27.020 --> 02:16:29.600]  So I said, hey, grab the.50 cal out of the safe.
[02:16:29.600 --> 02:16:34.520]  So that's why the.50 cal is here on the table, because on your shirt is the AK-47, a mortal
[02:16:34.520 --> 02:16:37.740]  technique since 1492, I get it.
[02:16:37.740 --> 02:16:43.660]  We the indigenous peoples are seizing our right to self determination and to be armed.
[02:16:43.660 --> 02:16:45.280]  Let's just touch on that.
[02:16:45.280 --> 02:16:50.660]  I always tell people when they come to me, they say, revolution, you have a lot of revolutionary
[02:16:50.660 --> 02:16:52.960]  figures from Latin America that are from the left wing.
[02:16:52.960 --> 02:16:57.780]  I explain to people, our revolution doesn't come with socialism or communism.
[02:16:57.780 --> 02:17:00.600]  That's an adverse effect of America's pressure.
[02:17:00.600 --> 02:17:06.080]  Originally, we heard the great prognosticator of democracy come down to Latin America at
[02:17:06.080 --> 02:17:12.240]  a time when we had a series of horrible imperialist military dictatorships that governments now
[02:17:12.240 --> 02:17:14.440]  are trying to resemble.
[02:17:14.440 --> 02:17:18.560]  Where if you were convicted of raping a woman as a military officer, you could get out of
[02:17:18.560 --> 02:17:20.640]  it by agreeing to marry her.
[02:17:20.640 --> 02:17:25.560]  The most insane type of laws you could possibly imagine that govern the government.
[02:17:25.560 --> 02:17:29.620]  But when we look at that, when people were saying you can have a democracy and you can
[02:17:29.620 --> 02:17:32.960]  vote for your own leaders, we thought that's wonderful.
[02:17:32.960 --> 02:17:34.280]  What a great idea.
[02:17:34.280 --> 02:17:42.280]  And then the great proselytizer of democracy we realized was the same one backing up Stroessner,
[02:17:42.280 --> 02:17:48.320]  Batista, the imperialist governments that existed in Latin America.
[02:17:48.320 --> 02:17:53.340]  And the country and the people of Latin America said, what else do you have on the table?
[02:17:53.340 --> 02:17:55.800]  Who else has something besides- And the Soviets came.
[02:17:55.800 --> 02:17:57.640]  And the Soviets and the Chinese came.
[02:17:57.640 --> 02:18:01.780]  And I explained to people, yes, that's a natural part of our society.
[02:18:01.780 --> 02:18:08.060]  But what we have to explain to individuals is, we didn't need a European man to come
[02:18:08.060 --> 02:18:14.040]  from the 19th century and explain to us dark people in Latin America the complex concept
[02:18:14.040 --> 02:18:19.200]  of- Plus anybody from Europe or the US, no matter what color they are, if they've got
[02:18:19.200 --> 02:18:22.360]  globalist backing, they're coming with the corporate jackals.
[02:18:22.360 --> 02:18:25.740]  They're coming with the economic hitmen, and so that's the issue.
[02:18:25.740 --> 02:18:29.280]  But then you find out that the mega banks, and this isn't a conspiracy, this is on record,
[02:18:29.280 --> 02:18:33.960]  funded the communist movement knowing Europe was revolting against the robber barons and
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:34.960]  the royalty.
[02:18:34.960 --> 02:18:39.040]  So they created a new fake grassroots movement that they could control.
[02:18:39.040 --> 02:18:42.660]  So it's the same thing with the Soviets going in there, absolutely.
[02:18:42.660 --> 02:18:48.480]  It's like running from Bush to Obama, and then running from Obama to Mitt Romney.
[02:18:48.480 --> 02:18:49.740]  They're all part of the same thing.
[02:18:49.740 --> 02:18:54.660]  So what do you say for America and Latin America and the world?
[02:18:54.660 --> 02:18:59.240]  What is at your core, moral tech, what is at the core of your belief, studying this
[02:18:59.240 --> 02:19:03.180]  so long, being an articulate, smart guy who's been around the world?
[02:19:03.180 --> 02:19:06.020]  From your historical research then, what system do you like?
[02:19:06.020 --> 02:19:10.260]  Because look, you got Peter Thiel, the big Bilderberg guy, trying to take over the libertarian
[02:19:10.260 --> 02:19:13.880]  movement right now, and turning it into a fake privatization tyranny.
[02:19:13.880 --> 02:19:19.560]  How do you beat something that metastasizes and, like the thing, turns into whatever you
[02:19:19.560 --> 02:19:20.560]  run to?
[02:19:20.560 --> 02:19:24.320]  Like you run to one system and it's real at first, but when you turn around, the thing
[02:19:24.320 --> 02:19:26.180]  grabs it, absorbs it.
[02:19:26.180 --> 02:19:31.120]  And then you turn around, and it looks like what you thought it was, but it isn't.
[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:34.120]  I am the one who said it.
[02:19:34.120 --> 02:19:41.640]  Yeah, you know my CEO corporate steez, please overthrow governments overseas in a breeze.
[02:19:41.640 --> 02:19:48.000]  Politicians in my pockets for a few hundred Gs, so if I'm never in court, my assets are
[02:19:48.000 --> 02:19:49.680]  never freed.
[02:19:49.680 --> 02:19:52.840]  I got a job and a house and a bank account, when I'm out, I doubt that's something you
[02:19:52.840 --> 02:19:53.840]  can say.
[02:19:53.840 --> 02:19:56.840]  And if not, then I think definitely, can the play make money every day the world burns
[02:19:56.840 --> 02:19:57.840]  on the taxes?
[02:19:57.840 --> 02:20:03.240]  Why y'all struggling to pay taxes?
[02:20:03.240 --> 02:20:09.540]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans, here is the Cal
[02:20:09.540 --> 02:20:11.200]  Ben Soap Company.

[02:22:34.080 --> 02:22:38.360]  counterfeit and carting to a private bank, having it lead back at interest, forcing taxes
[02:22:38.360 --> 02:22:39.360]  to service debt.
[02:22:39.360 --> 02:22:42.880]  This capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public
[02:22:42.880 --> 02:22:46.160]  currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army.
[02:22:46.160 --> 02:22:47.160]  Hi, Ted Anderson.

[02:23:03.800 --> 02:23:08.700]  In 1983, Long Life Food Depot was one of the first to sell MRE pouches to the public and
[02:23:08.700 --> 02:23:11.640]  we're still selling them almost 30 years later.

[02:23:51.520 --> 02:23:56.740]  Emergency preparedness, emergency relief, longlifefood.com since 1983, sending real
[02:23:56.740 --> 02:24:05.600]  food to your real future.
[02:24:05.600 --> 02:24:11.040]  The people who run this society, they present themselves as moral leaders.
[02:24:11.040 --> 02:24:15.400]  When you see somebody selling their body for money in the street, it's obvious that they're
[02:24:15.400 --> 02:24:17.540]  showcasing themselves.
[02:24:17.540 --> 02:24:21.700]  The prostitution is a visible object.
[02:24:21.700 --> 02:24:27.760]  When someone sells their soul for money, how obvious is that because it happens every single
[02:24:27.760 --> 02:24:33.320]  day as much as people who sell their body and they do more harm to American citizens
[02:24:33.320 --> 02:24:35.960]  and they do more harm to human beings than anybody else.
[02:24:35.960 --> 02:24:40.000]  And that's why they wanna make everybody poor is so we'll sell out to them.
[02:24:40.000 --> 02:24:42.520]  They don't want us being independent, amazing information.
[02:24:42.520 --> 02:24:45.880]  I wanted to get, I mean behind the scenes though, you said they'll never get rid of
[02:24:45.880 --> 02:24:46.880]  the guns.
[02:24:46.880 --> 02:24:50.460]  You said that on air, but I mean bottom line, you also talked about drones.
[02:24:50.460 --> 02:24:55.560]  My point is this gun's been using one crime to rob an armored car, not this gun, but one
[02:24:55.560 --> 02:24:59.760]  back in the 80s, the Barrett 50 cal, okay?
[02:24:59.760 --> 02:25:02.160]  Why would you need a Barrett in case you send drones to my house?
[02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:05.400]  Yeah, that was the point you made, I wanted you to repeat, but it's larger than that.
[02:25:05.400 --> 02:25:09.920]  You could also do all sorts of things just with a can of gasoline.
[02:25:09.920 --> 02:25:15.280]  The issue is it isn't about the can of gasoline or the truck or the gun, it is about the mindset
[02:25:15.280 --> 02:25:18.540]  and more of these guns out there makes it a freer society.
[02:25:18.540 --> 02:25:23.460]  Can I offer something, I mean, I understand your point and we can, that's a perfectly
[02:25:23.460 --> 02:25:24.460]  debatable issue.
[02:25:24.460 --> 02:25:27.300]  I know people that would disagree or agree with that as well.
[02:25:27.300 --> 02:25:31.860]  But I can offer another rationale instead of blaming guns, right, for all the violence
[02:25:31.860 --> 02:25:34.240]  in America like people are trying to do now.
[02:25:34.240 --> 02:25:39.960]  Instead of blaming video games like they're trying to do in Congress or violent movies,
[02:25:39.960 --> 02:25:41.100]  right?
[02:25:41.100 --> 02:25:44.300]  How about the fact that this country, this republic-
[02:25:44.300 --> 02:25:45.300]  Was born of blood.
[02:25:45.300 --> 02:25:49.180]  Only had 20 years of peace since its inception.
[02:25:49.180 --> 02:25:54.100]  Now, I would like to be able to blame this or blame something else, but I think that
[02:25:54.100 --> 02:25:56.660]  that's a very near-sighted solution.
[02:25:56.660 --> 02:25:59.320]  Just to look at it, yes, this- Now, we have a history of piracy.
[02:25:59.320 --> 02:26:02.140]  This does kill people, yes, absolutely.
[02:26:02.140 --> 02:26:06.880]  But so did Greek fire, so did a whole lot of other things that people invented and used.
[02:26:06.880 --> 02:26:09.500]  So did diseases that were given- Smallpox.
[02:26:09.500 --> 02:26:13.920]  Indigenous people purposefully, one of the first examples of genetic warfare against
[02:26:13.920 --> 02:26:15.540]  indigenous people by Europeans.
[02:26:15.540 --> 02:26:16.840]  That's in the British manual.
[02:26:16.840 --> 02:26:20.640]  And I think, thank you for pointing that out, because this is the point that I'm trying
[02:26:20.640 --> 02:26:21.740]  to make.
[02:26:21.740 --> 02:26:27.180]  We won't have that critical discussion about how violent our government is and how violent
[02:26:27.180 --> 02:26:29.060]  our society is.
[02:26:29.060 --> 02:26:32.380]  Blaming it on this is the easiest way out.
[02:26:32.380 --> 02:26:38.020]  It prevents you from looking inward and saying, what have I become complicit to in America?
[02:26:38.020 --> 02:26:40.980]  Well, let me say this, because what you say is absolutely on target.
[02:26:40.980 --> 02:26:42.680]  But here's the paradox.
[02:26:42.680 --> 02:26:51.060]  The United States was the giant, one of the last true freebooting, pirating, piratical,
[02:26:51.060 --> 02:26:56.880]  absolute, bets-are-off craziness, where you had all the different native tribes trying
[02:26:56.880 --> 02:27:02.620]  to get this tribe to fight with that tribe, and the French, and the Spanish, and the British,
[02:27:02.620 --> 02:27:03.660]  and the militias.
[02:27:03.660 --> 02:27:06.100]  And really, it was a free-for-all.
[02:27:06.100 --> 02:27:10.420]  And we really look at a lot of the groups using the same tactics.
[02:27:10.420 --> 02:27:15.200]  But the issue is that it was in that age, it was in that time.
[02:27:15.200 --> 02:27:19.460]  And if you look at that, there was a lot of murder and death, but it produced incredible
[02:27:19.460 --> 02:27:20.700]  wealth.
[02:27:20.700 --> 02:27:25.100]  Look at Europe, though, even more people actually killed by governments, and killed by the church,
[02:27:25.100 --> 02:27:28.560]  and killed by other things, but it was the stagnation.
[02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:32.060]  So I'm not saying any of the evil in our history is a good thing or riding it off.
[02:27:32.060 --> 02:27:38.900]  I'm saying the quieter evil has gone on in China and in Japan, where a samurai wanted
[02:27:38.900 --> 02:27:43.100]  to test out a sword, he would just chop up a few of his servants, and that was seen as
[02:27:43.100 --> 02:27:44.100]  okay.
[02:27:44.100 --> 02:27:45.480]  And I'm not attacking the Japanese either.
[02:27:45.480 --> 02:27:52.120]  My point is that the history has been skewed and twisted, not to demonize America, not
[02:27:52.120 --> 02:27:56.220]  to defend America, but to really not show people what really went on.
[02:27:56.220 --> 02:28:03.200]  And I don't even know what the point is, other than that why did, because there's other empires,
[02:28:03.200 --> 02:28:06.240]  why did 5% of the world population end up getting half the wealth?
[02:28:06.240 --> 02:28:07.900]  Now that's all ending.
[02:28:07.900 --> 02:28:12.800]  And I think it was because there was that absolute out of control behavior going on
[02:28:12.800 --> 02:28:15.260]  where the central powers weren't in control.
[02:28:15.260 --> 02:28:20.140]  It allowed more creativity and people to do what they wanted, separating that from all
[02:28:20.140 --> 02:28:21.140]  the killing and violence.
[02:28:21.140 --> 02:28:27.020]  Right, I think one thing that people need to realize is empires don't fall apart because
[02:28:27.020 --> 02:28:28.440]  they lose wars.
[02:28:28.440 --> 02:28:30.980]  We haven't won a war since World War II.
[02:28:30.980 --> 02:28:32.300]  We didn't win in Vietnam.
[02:28:32.300 --> 02:28:37.820]  I know Korean War veterans that schooled me to the game, and even though I'm not a huge
[02:28:37.820 --> 02:28:41.480]  fan of war, I always thank people for their service, cuz at least they had the courage
[02:28:41.480 --> 02:28:46.280]  to go, excuse my language, rather than the people who got 1,200 deferments and have no
[02:28:46.280 --> 02:28:48.100]  problem sending young-
[02:28:48.100 --> 02:28:50.380]  Sure, you can respect the individual for what they went through.
[02:28:50.380 --> 02:28:55.940]  But I think the point is that empires begin to die when people no longer believe in them.
[02:28:55.940 --> 02:29:01.860]  I mean, the partial collapse of the Soviet Union was due to the massive amount of cynicism
[02:29:01.860 --> 02:29:07.300]  that existed because the government was no longer believable outside of Moscow.
[02:29:07.300 --> 02:29:12.220]  In other words, the people that were living in this Siddhartha-like enclosement were like,
[02:29:12.220 --> 02:29:14.620]  yeah, this is the free Soviet-
[02:29:14.620 --> 02:29:15.780]  Lockshell chess cube.
[02:29:15.780 --> 02:29:20.640]  And then everybody outside was like, are you kidding me?
[02:29:20.640 --> 02:29:23.620]  You don't even have on paper what is going on here.
[02:29:23.620 --> 02:29:25.660]  Do you realize what's happening in Poland?
[02:29:25.660 --> 02:29:29.460]  Do you realize what's happening in Eastern Europe and Romania and all these other places?
[02:29:29.460 --> 02:29:30.460]  Do you have any clue?
[02:29:30.460 --> 02:29:35.420]  I mean, would you even be able to last for a day there without losing your mind?
[02:29:35.420 --> 02:29:37.980]  And I think that that's where we're at right now.
[02:29:37.980 --> 02:29:42.620]  The level of cynicism in this country has gotten to the point where people are saying,
[02:29:42.620 --> 02:29:44.940]  is there hope left for the republic?
[02:29:44.940 --> 02:29:46.120]  Can we save it?
[02:29:46.120 --> 02:29:50.460]  Is it worth saving?
[02:29:50.460 --> 02:29:51.780]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.780 --> 02:29:54.180]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.180 --> 02:30:00.740]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.740 --> 02:30:05.700]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even if I had a
[02:30:05.700 --> 02:30:07.860]  pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[02:30:07.860 --> 02:30:12.900]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops
[02:30:12.900 --> 02:30:17.060]  on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely
[02:30:17.060 --> 02:30:22.740]  depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to
[02:30:22.740 --> 02:30:25.820]  rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[02:30:25.820 --> 02:30:32.120]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[02:30:32.120 --> 02:30:36.280]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need.

[02:32:09.500 --> 02:32:12.220]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:32:12.220 --> 02:32:16.740]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states
[02:32:16.740 --> 02:32:17.980]  on earth.
[02:32:17.980 --> 02:32:22.800]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being
[02:32:22.800 --> 02:32:24.640]  expanded nationwide.
[02:32:24.640 --> 02:32:29.320]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful
[02:32:29.320 --> 02:32:30.740]  shadow state.
[02:32:30.740 --> 02:32:34.780]  Police state four chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.

[02:32:48.500 --> 02:32:50.540]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:32:50.540 --> 02:32:51.540]  It's here.

[02:33:14.100 --> 02:33:17.580]  I always tell people when they come to me, they say, oh, you know, revolution, you have
[02:33:17.580 --> 02:33:21.700]  a lot of revolutionary figures from Latin America that are from the left wing.
[02:33:21.700 --> 02:33:26.540]  I explained to people our revolution doesn't come with socialism or communism.
[02:33:26.540 --> 02:33:29.380]  That's an adverse effect of America's pressure.
[02:33:29.380 --> 02:33:34.860]  Originally, we heard the great prognosticator of democracy come down to Latin America at
[02:33:34.860 --> 02:33:41.020]  a time when we had a series of horrible imperialist military dictatorships that governments now
[02:33:41.020 --> 02:33:42.660]  are trying to resemble.
[02:33:42.660 --> 02:33:46.900]  You know, where, you know, if you were convicted of raping a woman as a military officer, you
[02:33:46.900 --> 02:33:49.420]  could get out of it by agreeing to marry her.
[02:33:49.420 --> 02:33:54.360]  The most insane type of laws you could possibly imagine that govern the government.
[02:33:54.360 --> 02:33:58.420]  But when we look at that, when people were saying you can have a democracy and you can
[02:33:58.420 --> 02:34:01.740]  vote for your own leaders, we thought that's wonderful.
[02:34:01.740 --> 02:34:03.060]  What a great idea.
[02:34:03.060 --> 02:34:11.060]  And then the great proselytizer of democracy, we realized, was the same one backing up Stroessner,
[02:34:11.060 --> 02:34:18.100]  at least, you know, the imperialist governments that existed in Latin America and the country
[02:34:18.100 --> 02:34:22.100]  and the people of Latin America said, what else do you have on the table?
[02:34:22.100 --> 02:34:26.420]  Who else has something besides the Soviets and the Chinese came?
[02:34:26.420 --> 02:34:30.540]  And I explained to people, yes, that's a natural part of our society.
[02:34:30.540 --> 02:34:37.300]  But what we have to explain to individuals is we didn't need a European man to come from
[02:34:37.300 --> 02:34:42.980]  the 19th century and explain to us dark people in Latin America the complex concept.
[02:34:42.980 --> 02:34:48.740]  Plus anybody from Europe or the US, no matter what color they are, if they've got globalist
[02:34:48.740 --> 02:34:51.180]  backing, they're coming with the corporate jackals.
[02:34:51.180 --> 02:34:53.480]  They're coming with the economic hitmen.
[02:34:53.480 --> 02:34:54.580]  And so that's the issue.
[02:34:54.580 --> 02:34:58.100]  But then you find out that the mega banks, this isn't a conspiracy, this is on record,
[02:34:58.100 --> 02:35:02.780]  funded the communist movement knowing Europe was revolting against the robber barons and
[02:35:02.780 --> 02:35:03.780]  the royalty.
[02:35:03.780 --> 02:35:07.840]  So they created a new fake grassroots movement that they could control.
[02:35:07.840 --> 02:35:11.460]  So it's the same thing with the Soviets going in there, absolutely.
[02:35:11.460 --> 02:35:17.300]  It's like running from Bush to Obama and then running from Obama to Mitt Romney.
[02:35:17.300 --> 02:35:18.540]  They're all part of the same thing.
[02:35:18.540 --> 02:35:23.460]  So what do you say for America and Latin America and the world?
[02:35:23.460 --> 02:35:27.880]  What is at your core, moral technique, tech, what is at the core of your belief studying
[02:35:27.880 --> 02:35:31.980]  this so long, being articulate, smart guy who's been around the world?
[02:35:31.980 --> 02:35:34.820]  From your historical research, then what system do you like?
[02:35:34.820 --> 02:35:39.060]  Because look, you got Peter Thiel, the big Bilderberg guy, trying to take over the libertarian
[02:35:39.060 --> 02:35:42.700]  movement right now and turning it into a fake privatization tyranny.
[02:35:42.700 --> 02:35:48.360]  How do you beat something that metastasizes and like the thing turns into whatever you
[02:35:48.360 --> 02:35:49.360]  run to?
[02:35:49.360 --> 02:35:53.140]  Like you run to one system and it's real at first, but when you turn around, the thing
[02:35:53.140 --> 02:35:54.980]  grabs it, absorbs it.
[02:35:54.980 --> 02:35:59.780]  And then you turn around and it looks like what you thought it was, but it isn't.
[02:35:59.780 --> 02:36:04.980]  Now when you discuss all of these issues that are going on in the world, I think what people
[02:36:04.980 --> 02:36:08.420]  don't do is they don't connect the actual history to it.
[02:36:08.420 --> 02:36:14.240]  And I think that's where I try to implement that to them or implement those ideas.
[02:36:14.240 --> 02:36:18.900]  When I say, hey, listen, if you look at the history of Russia and the quote unquote USSR
[02:36:18.900 --> 02:36:22.380]  bringing freedom, do they bring freedom to Eastern Europe?
[02:36:22.380 --> 02:36:24.100]  No, they brought mass murder and death.
[02:36:24.100 --> 02:36:28.220]  You have to understand, they did the same thing to Eastern Europe that America did to
[02:36:28.220 --> 02:36:29.980]  Central America and to the Caribbean.
[02:36:29.980 --> 02:36:30.980]  They colonized it.
[02:36:30.980 --> 02:36:34.900]  Right, colonized it, took it over and said, you know what, we're gonna make you dependent
[02:36:34.900 --> 02:36:39.820]  on us to the point that they can still shut off the gas in the Ukraine five years ago.
[02:36:39.820 --> 02:36:44.920]  This is not a conspiracy and people talk to me about 9-11 and they say, hey, how can you
[02:36:44.920 --> 02:36:46.380]  not believe the government story?
[02:36:46.380 --> 02:36:51.360]  And I always say, listen, I am not sitting here saying that I know exactly what happened,
[02:36:51.360 --> 02:36:52.360]  but you know what?
[02:36:52.360 --> 02:36:55.700]  I will say this much, I cannot believe the government because they couldn't tell the
[02:36:55.700 --> 02:36:58.460]  truth about the air to breathe to people.
[02:36:58.460 --> 02:36:59.980]  That's the simplest thing in the world.
[02:36:59.980 --> 02:37:03.380]  That's it, if they've been caught lying over and over and over again and caught doing false
[02:37:03.380 --> 02:37:05.240]  flags, you've got to question it.
[02:37:05.240 --> 02:37:10.400]  But breaking that down, sure, you've had colonial powers and the British are the most successful
[02:37:10.400 --> 02:37:12.460]  model so it's been adopted by the corporations and-
[02:37:12.460 --> 02:37:17.580]  Reinforced with religion, reinforced with neoliberalism now, reinforced with the-
[02:37:17.580 --> 02:37:18.580]  Sure, well, that's their cover.
[02:37:18.580 --> 02:37:20.220]  I mean, it's like giving Obama a peace prize.
[02:37:20.220 --> 02:37:25.340]  But what I'm saying is now they put out that Dinesh D'Souza film and I interviewed him
[02:37:25.340 --> 02:37:28.580]  and he's saying Obama is anti-colonialist.
[02:37:28.580 --> 02:37:32.300]  That's why he's doing all this stuff and it's the opposite.
[02:37:32.300 --> 02:37:36.300]  Obama has a CIA cover as an anti-colonialist.
[02:37:36.300 --> 02:37:43.540]  But clearly, his job is to bring in global corporate colonialism that's so powerful now,
[02:37:43.540 --> 02:37:48.740]  the banks are above the law, they issue the money, and they're gonna dissolve the countries
[02:37:48.740 --> 02:37:52.140]  and even the old empires into one global empire.
[02:37:52.140 --> 02:37:54.220]  And then what's its ideology?
[02:37:54.220 --> 02:37:59.220]  Other empires were domination, total control, but most empires, unless it was Hitler, and
[02:37:59.220 --> 02:38:05.100]  what he tried to establish as the neo-Germanic empire, did not want to exterminate everybody.
[02:38:05.100 --> 02:38:08.740]  That had been done some with the natives in some of the areas, but this is a eugenics
[02:38:08.740 --> 02:38:14.180]  based exterminism, which isn't fair to say ultra-Hitlerian because Hitler got his ideas
[02:38:14.180 --> 02:38:15.180]  from these people.
[02:38:15.180 --> 02:38:19.280]  So how do you talk to the left, the right, the people that are into native rights, people
[02:38:19.280 --> 02:38:23.980]  that are UN stuff, when all of it's a projection of a global corporate takeover?
[02:38:23.980 --> 02:38:30.300]  Because they have these ideas based on mainstream media about who we're fighting against.
[02:38:30.300 --> 02:38:34.780]  You know, for example, if you tell the average American, we're not at war with radical Islam,
[02:38:34.780 --> 02:38:35.780]  they think you're crazy.
[02:38:35.780 --> 02:38:38.420]  They say, no, we're not at war with communism.
[02:38:38.420 --> 02:38:42.380]  They think you're insane until you say, hey, wait a minute, we're not at war with radical
[02:38:42.380 --> 02:38:45.100]  Islam because who's our biggest ally in the region?
[02:38:45.100 --> 02:38:50.540]  Saudi Arabia, their brand of Wahhabism is like the Taliban with money, and they have
[02:38:50.540 --> 02:38:52.940]  the influence to interfere in Syria.
[02:38:52.940 --> 02:38:57.740]  And what about communism, when they say, we're not against communism, how could you say that?
[02:38:57.740 --> 02:38:59.460]  Who's our biggest economic partner?
[02:38:59.460 --> 02:39:00.460]  China.
[02:39:00.460 --> 02:39:04.340]  China, so you know who we're really at war with, and I tell people all the time, we're
[02:39:04.340 --> 02:39:10.020]  at war with people that say no to us, no to the agenda of the people who run behind-
[02:39:10.020 --> 02:39:11.620]  Wow, it's a mafia.
[02:39:11.620 --> 02:39:13.100]  That's technically how it is.
[02:39:13.100 --> 02:39:18.380]  I mean, if we don't give access to natural resources as a third world entity, we find
[02:39:18.380 --> 02:39:20.660]  ourselves on a hit list.
[02:39:20.660 --> 02:39:24.100]  You find yourself being persecuted, being brought down-
[02:39:24.100 --> 02:39:25.700]  If you try to be sovereign.
[02:39:25.700 --> 02:39:31.340]  It doesn't matter if you're a communist government, or it doesn't matter if you are a capitalist
[02:39:31.340 --> 02:39:34.100]  entity that just wants a little more of the slice.
[02:39:34.100 --> 02:39:40.500]  They'll portray you, one, as a Stalinist, or two, they'll portray you as a kleptocracy,
[02:39:40.500 --> 02:39:43.340]  when in reality, who were you stealing money for?
[02:39:43.340 --> 02:39:47.420]  You, we just didn't wanna cut you in anymore because you felt like it's America, you weren't
[02:39:47.420 --> 02:39:49.220]  doing enough to get your slice.
[02:39:49.220 --> 02:39:52.980]  You know a lot of the Republicans are racist, or tribal, or are using it, at least.
[02:39:52.980 --> 02:39:57.220]  But with Democrats, from my real research, they were the party of the Klan, they were
[02:39:57.220 --> 02:40:00.760]  the party of the South, they couldn't win.
[02:40:00.760 --> 02:40:04.180]  And so Margaret Sanger and the Rockefellers, and I've got their memos, those aren't public,
[02:40:04.180 --> 02:40:05.660]  those are in the Library of Congress.
[02:40:05.660 --> 02:40:08.500]  They said, we're gonna pose as liberals, we're gonna hire the black leaders, we're gonna
[02:40:08.500 --> 02:40:09.620]  kill these weeds.
[02:40:09.620 --> 02:40:14.300]  I don't think black people are weeds, not because I'm some bleeding heart person, I
[02:40:14.300 --> 02:40:18.240]  don't want any people being treated like slaves, cuz I know we're all humans, and it all comes
[02:40:18.240 --> 02:40:19.240]  back on us.
[02:40:19.240 --> 02:40:24.580]  So I've said that, your take on the Nancy Pelosi's, the Harry Reid's, the neo-liberals.
[02:40:24.580 --> 02:40:27.920]  Because from my research, they know they're not liberals.
[02:40:27.920 --> 02:40:31.860]  These people are hard, you want the real racist?
[02:40:31.860 --> 02:40:33.880]  Cuz Republicans will just use it for control.
[02:40:33.880 --> 02:40:39.040]  You want the real racist, look at how they use both sides.
[02:40:39.040 --> 02:40:46.120]  I think that what people don't realize is that when you use code language to talk about
[02:40:46.120 --> 02:40:47.380]  people, you know what I mean?
[02:40:47.380 --> 02:40:53.620]  When you play the holier than thou card, and I'm a good Christian soul, the pathos, the
[02:40:53.620 --> 02:40:59.020]  ethos of the argument doesn't equal up, which is why Republicans look like hypocrites.
[02:40:59.020 --> 02:41:09.100]  The problem is that people don't examine the actual end result of some of the policies
[02:41:09.100 --> 02:41:11.820]  of Democrats at that specific time, you know what I mean?
[02:41:11.820 --> 02:41:16.860]  I think, for example, Obama gets a huge pass, I wanted to ask him this.
[02:41:16.860 --> 02:41:21.580]  I really hope when he gets out of office, I say to him, you know what?
[02:41:21.580 --> 02:41:26.340]  I saw you on TV shed tears for children from Sandy Hook.
[02:41:26.340 --> 02:41:28.540]  Totally fake.
[02:41:28.540 --> 02:41:32.660]  Without even that, without injecting that control into the conversation, I wanna ask
[02:41:32.660 --> 02:41:37.780]  him, how many tears have you ever shed for the children of Pakistan, for the children
[02:41:37.780 --> 02:41:42.600]  of Yemen, for the children of Gaza, whose drones and planes sponsored by America fly
[02:41:42.600 --> 02:41:43.900]  over and kill them?
[02:41:43.900 --> 02:41:46.180]  Have you shed one tear for them?
[02:41:46.180 --> 02:41:47.180]  You know what I mean?
[02:41:47.180 --> 02:41:50.820]  Have you said one prayer in your private quiet time?
[02:41:50.820 --> 02:41:54.900]  Because if you have, I've never heard it, and maybe you don't think it's popular enough
[02:41:54.900 --> 02:41:57.060]  to do, but it's necessary.
[02:41:57.060 --> 02:42:03.580]  Two, I think that when you talk about a liberal bias or when you talk about any of these aspects
[02:42:03.580 --> 02:42:09.780]  of society, you can frame it in whatever way you want to, right?
[02:42:09.780 --> 02:42:15.300]  But if you are still controlled by the people economically, it doesn't matter what you claim
[02:42:15.300 --> 02:42:16.300]  to be.
[02:42:16.300 --> 02:42:20.600]  In other words, if I say I'm a martial artist, Alex, and yet some guy comes in and lays me
[02:42:20.600 --> 02:42:24.340]  out with one punch, I don't know a simple block, I'm not a martial artist.
[02:42:24.340 --> 02:42:28.780]  If I claim, yeah, I'm a doctor, you are eating something, you start choking, I can't even
[02:42:28.780 --> 02:42:29.780]  perform the Heimlich.
[02:42:29.780 --> 02:42:32.800]  I'm not a doctor, I'm a fraud.
[02:42:32.800 --> 02:42:37.780]  Most of these people that are out there that permeate this sort of idea that they're some
[02:42:37.780 --> 02:42:42.240]  bleeding heart, I don't see them on the front lines of this stuff.
[02:42:42.240 --> 02:42:45.780]  I don't see them willing to get their hands dirty.
[02:42:45.780 --> 02:42:47.780]  They're like Pontius Pilate.
[02:42:47.780 --> 02:42:49.520]  This isn't my problem.
[02:42:49.520 --> 02:42:54.420]  In the same way that we look at it and we say, America came to the rescue of Jewish
[02:42:54.420 --> 02:42:55.980]  people in World War II.
[02:42:55.980 --> 02:42:59.780]  No, you didn't, you sent the St. Louis back.
[02:42:59.780 --> 02:43:01.540]  That's what you did, you know what I mean?
[02:43:01.540 --> 02:43:04.260]  Don't sit here and recreate a lie.
[02:43:04.260 --> 02:43:06.400]  Our elite funded Hitler.
[02:43:06.400 --> 02:43:11.480]  We have a guy that we have commemorated called Christopher Columbus, right?
[02:43:11.480 --> 02:43:16.040]  But I always tell Catholics and Italians, you can find somebody better from the Catholic
[02:43:16.040 --> 02:43:21.600]  Church even though in my mind, the institution itself is corrupt.
[02:43:21.600 --> 02:43:24.120]  You can find somebody like a bishop-
[02:43:24.120 --> 02:43:25.620]  Mother Teresa.
[02:43:25.620 --> 02:43:27.420]  Anybody who's a better example.
[02:43:27.420 --> 02:43:32.060]  Italians, you can find a mother who sells pizza in Brooklyn right now who's a better
[02:43:32.060 --> 02:43:36.500]  example of an Italian American than Christopher Columbus who never even touched America and
[02:43:36.500 --> 02:43:40.460]  who was prostituting eight and nine year old girls.
[02:43:40.460 --> 02:43:42.260]  Eight and nine year old indigenous women.
[02:43:42.260 --> 02:43:47.020]  That should break the heart of every parent who's watching this program right now.
[02:43:47.020 --> 02:43:48.460]  If we don't confront that-
[02:43:48.460 --> 02:43:51.380]  But see, it's the dehumanization.
[02:43:51.380 --> 02:43:55.580]  It's just like Obama decided to flip the switch and cry for the Sandy Hook because it was
[02:43:55.580 --> 02:43:56.580]  an agenda.
[02:43:56.580 --> 02:44:02.260]  But they will never personalize the kids killed by drones or the million plus Iraqis because
[02:44:02.260 --> 02:44:04.920]  it all is a big cold blooded show.
[02:44:04.920 --> 02:44:09.580]  And it's all about how they're punching our buttons and then they're basically dehumanizing
[02:44:09.580 --> 02:44:10.580]  the whole of humanity.
[02:44:10.580 --> 02:44:11.580]  You're absolutely right.
[02:44:11.580 --> 02:44:12.860]  Let me ask you something.
[02:44:12.860 --> 02:44:18.060]  I know that you are a supporter of Israel to a certain degree.
[02:44:18.060 --> 02:44:22.340]  At least someone's told me that, I don't know if that's true.
[02:44:22.340 --> 02:44:28.740]  What do you think about the way that Palestinians are disenfranchised to their human rights?
[02:44:28.740 --> 02:44:33.140]  We're not with the Newt Gingrich crowd here, that they're an invented people.
[02:44:33.140 --> 02:44:36.340]  Cuz when he said that, I was like, what are Americans?
[02:44:36.340 --> 02:44:37.340]  You know what I mean?
[02:44:37.340 --> 02:44:39.780]  It's a collective of European people that didn't wanna be ruled.
[02:44:39.780 --> 02:44:44.660]  No, I mean clearly the people that got kicked out of that area of Israel or Palestine are
[02:44:44.660 --> 02:44:45.660]  Palestinians.
[02:44:45.660 --> 02:44:46.660]  The people that lived in Palestine.
[02:44:46.660 --> 02:44:47.660]  Yeah.
[02:44:47.660 --> 02:44:48.660]  So it's like-
[02:44:48.660 --> 02:44:49.660]  I think there's sometimes-
[02:44:49.660 --> 02:44:51.620]  Well listen, that's all a misrepresentation.
[02:44:51.620 --> 02:44:52.620]  Right.
[02:44:52.620 --> 02:44:56.740]  Just like at the start of the interview, they take like a 15 year old clip-
[02:44:56.740 --> 02:44:57.740]  Right.
[02:44:57.740 --> 02:45:03.660]  Out of context where I'm saying, I said, now from the perspective though, the UN is against
[02:45:03.660 --> 02:45:04.660]  Israel.
[02:45:04.660 --> 02:45:05.660]  They're playing both sides.
[02:45:05.660 --> 02:45:09.340]  Now then, from that perspective, and you watch, people will cut this out.
[02:45:09.340 --> 02:45:10.340]  Right.
[02:45:10.340 --> 02:45:15.140]  I said, I support the state of Israel's right to exist, and then I went on to say, but I
[02:45:15.140 --> 02:45:16.140]  don't support what they're doing.
[02:45:16.140 --> 02:45:17.140]  Right.
[02:45:17.140 --> 02:45:20.580]  Now that was like 14, 15 years ago, but I guess in like 1998, so 14, 15 years ago.
[02:45:20.580 --> 02:45:23.700]  Cuz I always thought to myself- But had you seen that clip?
[02:45:23.700 --> 02:45:27.380]  No, no, someone had played it for, played an excerpt of it, which is why I wanted to
[02:45:27.380 --> 02:45:28.380]  ask you.
[02:45:28.380 --> 02:45:29.380]  Yeah, so people like to play audio.
[02:45:29.380 --> 02:45:32.620]  But that's the point, I wanted to say- I actually liked the video because I'm about 60 pounds
[02:45:32.620 --> 02:45:33.620]  lighter.
[02:45:33.620 --> 02:45:35.500]  No, but let's go back here for just a minute.
[02:45:35.500 --> 02:45:40.500]  Where I stand is talking about Israel helping create fake Al-Qaeda, Israel manipulating
[02:45:40.500 --> 02:45:44.060]  our internal politics, Israel attacking the USS Liberty.
[02:45:44.060 --> 02:45:47.260]  I've made films about it, I've criticized it.
[02:45:47.260 --> 02:45:52.300]  But there's a cult of people that then make everything about Israel and only about Israel.
[02:45:52.300 --> 02:45:55.580]  And so they edit things and change things.
[02:45:55.580 --> 02:46:00.060]  And they've got me saying kill black people online, but I didn't say that.
[02:46:00.060 --> 02:46:03.500]  So a lot of that is, notice you were shown audio, right?
[02:46:03.500 --> 02:46:04.500]  Not now, he was edited.
[02:46:04.500 --> 02:46:06.220]  That's why I'm here to talk to you about it.
[02:46:06.220 --> 02:46:12.260]  So what they do is, listen, I've gone, hey, not everybody that does the El Diablo is worshiping
[02:46:12.260 --> 02:46:13.260]  the devil.
[02:46:13.260 --> 02:46:15.020]  In Italy, this is the war on off evil.
[02:46:15.020 --> 02:46:16.020]  Right.
[02:46:16.020 --> 02:46:21.220]  Well, they take that still and say, Alex said he worshiped Satan with a mortal technique.
[02:46:21.220 --> 02:46:23.820]  But see, I'm telling you, it's major deception.
[02:46:23.820 --> 02:46:25.700]  Just like people say about you, you're a communist.
[02:46:25.700 --> 02:46:26.700]  Right.
[02:46:26.700 --> 02:46:31.300]  Well, I mean, I think that communism and socialism are a natural part of human development, whether
[02:46:31.300 --> 02:46:33.340]  you choose- No, I know, but what I'm saying is there's
[02:46:33.340 --> 02:46:36.540]  a massive amount of disinformation out there.
[02:46:36.540 --> 02:46:41.020]  And no matter how many times I say, I don't support a lot of what Israel's doing.
[02:46:41.020 --> 02:46:43.560]  They spin that and say that means unconditional support for Israel.
[02:46:43.560 --> 02:46:44.560]  That's not what's happening.
[02:46:44.560 --> 02:46:45.560]  Right.
[02:46:45.560 --> 02:46:47.660]  I'm not, no, I know it's a colonial operation.
[02:46:47.660 --> 02:46:51.480]  The point is, and I've said that in the news, no one ever quotes that.
[02:46:51.480 --> 02:46:54.540]  They take a 14 year old thing out of context and twist it.
[02:46:54.540 --> 02:46:55.660]  So I say, let them have it.
[02:46:55.660 --> 02:46:56.660]  Right.
[02:46:56.660 --> 02:46:57.660]  They say I'm a Jewish agent.
[02:46:57.660 --> 02:46:58.660]  I'm Jewish.
[02:46:58.660 --> 02:46:59.660]  Not true, but hey, okay.
[02:46:59.660 --> 02:47:00.660]  They say I'm a reptoid.
[02:47:00.660 --> 02:47:03.500]  But you know, they say- Mazel tov.
[02:47:03.500 --> 02:47:04.500]  Yeah, exactly.
[02:47:04.500 --> 02:47:05.500]  So my whole deal is you bet, I am.
[02:47:05.500 --> 02:47:06.700]  They also say I'm KGB.
[02:47:06.700 --> 02:47:07.700]  You bet I am.
[02:47:07.700 --> 02:47:08.700]  Okay.
[02:47:08.700 --> 02:47:11.260]  No, actually, I'm a guy who loves liberty and justice, who's really trying to figure
[02:47:11.260 --> 02:47:12.260]  it all out.
[02:47:12.260 --> 02:47:16.020]  Well, but when people have always tried to pull the Marxist card with me, I've said,
[02:47:16.020 --> 02:47:17.020]  you know what?
[02:47:17.020 --> 02:47:20.420]  The difference is between you and me is I've actually read that book because I had to study
[02:47:20.420 --> 02:47:22.460]  it to understand how- It's pretty sophisticated.
[02:47:22.460 --> 02:47:23.860]  How much control- I've read it too.
[02:47:23.860 --> 02:47:25.240]  Wanted over a society.
[02:47:25.240 --> 02:47:30.140]  And when I was done with that, I said to myself, wow, it reminds me, and you mentioned it before,
[02:47:30.140 --> 02:47:33.780]  the great KRS one who said, there's no such thing as a government.
[02:47:33.780 --> 02:47:36.500]  It's just people who rule over other people.
[02:47:36.500 --> 02:47:41.580]  And they design these little fancy systems so it looks like they're bringing freedom
[02:47:41.580 --> 02:47:43.120]  or they're bringing order.
[02:47:43.120 --> 02:47:49.020]  And America, the sad part is we are so cynical right now that I know people who are lovers
[02:47:49.020 --> 02:47:53.920]  of democracy that say, I'd rather see a king that could get something done and balance
[02:47:53.920 --> 02:47:58.260]  a budget than a president that can't do- The system makes it worse and worse.
[02:47:58.260 --> 02:47:59.900]  That's where they want us to be.
[02:47:59.900 --> 02:48:02.580]  Here's the key, I'll look around the camera and say this right here.
[02:48:02.580 --> 02:48:05.620]  Here's the key to all of this, just what he just said.
[02:48:05.620 --> 02:48:09.660]  The system is running this, we don't blame it all on them, but 90% of it is the way things
[02:48:09.660 --> 02:48:10.660]  are ordered.
[02:48:10.660 --> 02:48:14.860]  Humans are unlimitedly productive and incredible, history's shown that.
[02:48:14.860 --> 02:48:19.900]  And the system is doing almost all of this, and then it says, look at what happened, give
[02:48:19.900 --> 02:48:22.540]  me more power, and then it gets worse and worse.
[02:48:22.540 --> 02:48:23.540]  That's the key.
[02:48:23.540 --> 02:48:27.900]  Right, and I think that that gets lost in the right versus left paradigm because there
[02:48:27.900 --> 02:48:34.420]  are still very, very rich people from the left wing, supposedly, that don't wanna have
[02:48:34.420 --> 02:48:36.680]  anything to do with urban society.
[02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:42.340]  They say to themselves, the upper crust of America, the 1% have abandoned the public
[02:48:42.340 --> 02:48:43.340]  education system.
[02:48:43.340 --> 02:48:46.680]  There's nobody more- Abandoned the public education system.
[02:48:46.680 --> 02:48:50.260]  They don't send their kids to public school, I'm sorry.
[02:48:50.260 --> 02:48:55.720]  And also, we can expand on that and say, hey, do you think Obama would be president if he
[02:48:55.720 --> 02:48:57.140]  hadn't gone to Harvard?
[02:48:57.140 --> 02:49:02.700]  No, he had no real, and please pardon me if someone wants to debate it, I totally can
[02:49:02.700 --> 02:49:03.700]  out there.
[02:49:03.700 --> 02:49:06.420]  He didn't have a gigantic amount of accolades to run on.
[02:49:06.420 --> 02:49:12.660]  I specifically remember them using in the media the fact that he was the editor of the
[02:49:12.660 --> 02:49:18.160]  Harvard Law Review as a selling point for his ability to run the government.
[02:49:18.160 --> 02:49:23.400]  And I always said to myself, where do you meet the future movers and shakers of society?
[02:49:23.400 --> 02:49:24.540]  In private school.
[02:49:24.540 --> 02:49:30.460]  However, if you as a rich liberal individual step back and say, well, I don't need to fund
[02:49:30.460 --> 02:49:34.660]  public school cuz that's not my problem, then don't complain when some poor, uneducated
[02:49:34.660 --> 02:49:39.940]  individual who didn't have a chance, who had every single aspect of his freedom infringed
[02:49:39.940 --> 02:49:41.380]  upon by police.
[02:49:41.380 --> 02:49:46.020]  Who couldn't get a regular job, had a felony at 18, and is now robbing and stealing, blows
[02:49:46.020 --> 02:49:50.740]  your kid's head off just to steal his car that he doesn't know has a low jack in it,
[02:49:50.740 --> 02:49:53.560]  or is worth half of what it was when it rolled off the lot.
[02:49:53.560 --> 02:50:01.100]  If you're not part of this society, then how are you even gonna sit there and pass judgment
[02:50:01.100 --> 02:50:05.700]  or claim that you wanna help it or claim that you're even part of America?
[02:50:05.700 --> 02:50:07.940]  You're either part of this or you're not.
[02:50:07.940 --> 02:50:13.260]  The massive amount of corporations that make money off this country want their business
[02:50:13.260 --> 02:50:17.540]  exported from here and yet they wanna sell to people from here.
[02:50:17.540 --> 02:50:21.980]  They don't wanna pay their fair share of what it costs to run this country, what it costs
[02:50:21.980 --> 02:50:27.220]  for the military to back up those areas where they're taking natural resources out of, but
[02:50:27.220 --> 02:50:29.060]  they want all the benefits of it.
[02:50:29.060 --> 02:50:33.300]  In other words, they wanna have sex with America, but they don't wanna marry her.
[02:50:33.300 --> 02:50:37.340]  They're whoring her out, and I have no respect for those type of people, whether they come
[02:50:37.340 --> 02:50:39.820]  from the left, whether they come from the right.
[02:50:39.820 --> 02:50:43.900]  And unfortunately, I tell people, what you're gonna have to deal with now, Alex, is a whole
[02:50:43.900 --> 02:51:01.980]  lot of frauds coming into the libertarian movement.
[02:51:01.980 --> 02:51:03.460]  Your freedoms are on the line.
[02:51:03.460 --> 02:51:05.300]  The Second Amendment is in danger.
[02:51:05.300 --> 02:51:07.680]  How soon before your freedoms are taken away?
[02:51:07.680 --> 02:51:09.380]  What can you not live without?
[02:51:09.380 --> 02:51:11.020]  What is your greatest dependency?
[02:51:11.020 --> 02:51:12.020]  Is it your guns?
[02:51:12.020 --> 02:51:13.020]  Is it your home?
[02:51:13.020 --> 02:51:14.020]  No.
[02:51:14.020 --> 02:51:15.020]  It's food.
[02:51:15.020 --> 02:51:16.500]  It all boils down to the food supply.
[02:51:16.500 --> 02:51:20.220]  Tyrannical governments control people by controlling their food supply.
[02:51:20.220 --> 02:51:21.220]  Don't be dependent.
[02:51:21.220 --> 02:51:22.500]  Be self-sufficient.
[02:51:22.500 --> 02:51:24.100]  Don't wait for the government to feed you.
[02:51:24.100 --> 02:51:25.100]  Feed yourself.
[02:51:25.100 --> 02:51:27.340]  I can warn you, but I can't feed you.
[02:51:27.340 --> 02:51:30.940]  Do like Alex has done and get a supply of food from e Foods Direct.
[02:51:30.940 --> 02:51:33.700]  It's the best long-term, storable food on the planet.

[02:52:00.740 --> 02:52:02.260]  Hey, everybody.
[02:52:02.260 --> 02:52:03.260]  Ty Bollinger here.
[02:52:03.260 --> 02:52:05.700]  Once again, real life, real stories.
[02:52:05.700 --> 02:52:10.620]  And he discovered Carnivora, was so thrilled with the product that he shared it with his
[02:52:10.620 --> 02:52:12.920]  family and his friends and his patients.
[02:52:12.920 --> 02:52:14.140]  My dad was a family physician.
[02:52:14.140 --> 02:52:15.380]  He was a medical doctor.
[02:52:15.380 --> 02:52:18.580]  Almost all the symptoms were either diminished or gone.
[02:52:18.580 --> 02:52:20.260]  Amazing product, amazing results.
[02:52:20.260 --> 02:52:26.420]  It's like an amazing thing having such a profound change in how I feel and knowing that it was
[02:52:26.420 --> 02:52:27.780]  the Carnivora that did it.
[02:52:27.780 --> 02:52:34.420]  And a lot of patients got better, ranging from immune dysfunction to allergies and infection.

[02:53:59.740 --> 02:54:11.220]  A man who walks with God can walk anywhere, hence all the race stuff and all the fighting
[02:54:11.220 --> 02:54:12.900]  and all the crap doesn't matter.
[02:54:12.900 --> 02:54:16.780]  In the final equation, I don't care if you're some rich white yuppie or some poor inner
[02:54:16.780 --> 02:54:21.900]  city white person or whatever it is, you are having chemical and bio weapons put in the
[02:54:21.900 --> 02:54:23.140]  air and the food and the water.
[02:54:23.140 --> 02:54:27.260]  They're testing on you, just getting ready for their big move because they already have
[02:54:27.260 --> 02:54:29.220]  the life extension technologies.
[02:54:29.220 --> 02:54:35.080]  And the motive is, the moral technique is they don't want you to have that.
[02:54:35.080 --> 02:54:38.760]  Like the guy says, I will destroy your seed forever and last the Mohicans.
[02:54:38.760 --> 02:54:40.920]  The globalist, all ancient groups run to that.
[02:54:40.920 --> 02:54:43.020]  They want all of our seed destroyed.
[02:54:43.020 --> 02:54:44.460]  We're not going to be part of the future.
[02:54:44.460 --> 02:54:48.440]  The ultimate Roman takeover was to kill the whole population and salt the earth.
[02:54:48.440 --> 02:54:52.420]  The globalists are salting the earth with GMO while building their underground seed
[02:54:52.420 --> 02:54:53.420]  worlds.
[02:54:53.420 --> 02:54:54.420]  It's Moonraker.
[02:54:54.420 --> 02:54:55.420]  Ian Fleming, MI6 wrote that.
[02:54:55.420 --> 02:54:56.460]  Moonraker's real.
[02:54:56.460 --> 02:55:02.860]  And when people say to me, they say, are you drinking that left wing Kool-Aid?
[02:55:02.860 --> 02:55:08.100]  I always say to them, it tastes just as good as the right wing Monsanto's milk.
[02:55:08.100 --> 02:55:13.580]  Because no matter which one you want and which one you're willing to absorb, I think you
[02:55:13.580 --> 02:55:15.940]  have to get past this paradigm.
[02:55:15.940 --> 02:55:20.700]  And I think that's where programs like this and what I do, we don't have to agree about
[02:55:20.700 --> 02:55:25.980]  every single thing, but what we do agree about is that we don't want people to believe everything
[02:55:25.980 --> 02:55:27.100]  that we say.
[02:55:27.100 --> 02:55:29.100]  We want people to question everything.
[02:55:29.100 --> 02:55:30.100]  Full spectrum analysis.
[02:55:30.100 --> 02:55:31.100]  Yes.
[02:55:31.100 --> 02:55:34.020]  But then that can also go into the extreme where without proof people just make up, well,
[02:55:34.020 --> 02:55:35.620]  this guy's this or this guy's that.
[02:55:35.620 --> 02:55:39.220]  In closing, The Martyr, tell us about the music.
[02:55:39.220 --> 02:55:42.140]  The Martyr is a 100% free album.
[02:55:42.140 --> 02:55:46.220]  And when I say free, you can go to Viper Records right now and you can get it.
[02:55:46.220 --> 02:55:50.580]  It features all the people that I have worked with over these years have been a part of
[02:55:50.580 --> 02:55:51.580]  this.
[02:55:51.580 --> 02:55:52.580]  We gave it for free.
[02:55:52.580 --> 02:55:54.860]  And when I say free, you don't have to fill out a survey.
[02:55:54.860 --> 02:55:56.820]  No 22nd Vivo commercial.
[02:55:56.820 --> 02:55:58.060]  You press one button.
[02:55:58.060 --> 02:55:59.800]  It's an absolutely free album.
[02:55:59.800 --> 02:56:04.300]  And the beauty of it was that I wanted to show people you don't have to die for revolution,
[02:56:04.300 --> 02:56:05.300]  Alex.
[02:56:05.300 --> 02:56:06.300]  That's not the point.
[02:56:06.300 --> 02:56:07.760]  Gotta stop believing in the system.
[02:56:07.760 --> 02:56:10.080]  You have to live for revolution.
[02:56:10.080 --> 02:56:11.080]  That's what they are.
[02:56:11.080 --> 02:56:12.080]  I like that.
[02:56:12.080 --> 02:56:13.080]  They're afraid of that.
[02:56:13.080 --> 02:56:14.080]  You don't have to die for revolution.
[02:56:14.080 --> 02:56:15.080]  You gotta live for it.
[02:56:15.080 --> 02:56:16.080]  You have to live for it.
[02:56:16.080 --> 02:56:17.080]  Change your mind.
[02:56:17.080 --> 02:56:21.020]  It's a matter for someone to sit there and say, you know, I'm going to go out in a blaze
[02:56:21.020 --> 02:56:26.100]  of glory tomorrow and I'm really going to make them pay as opposed to say, you know
[02:56:26.100 --> 02:56:31.280]  what, I'm going to go through the painstaking suffering of raising a boy and two little
[02:56:31.280 --> 02:56:38.820]  girls in this damn near fascist society in order to raise them to look at the world differently
[02:56:38.820 --> 02:56:39.820]  and to see.
[02:56:39.820 --> 02:56:40.820]  It's a long haul.
[02:56:40.820 --> 02:56:41.820]  Beautifully said.
[02:56:41.820 --> 02:56:46.220]  Let me ask you this, the immortal technique that sounds like evergreen or an idea that
[02:56:46.220 --> 02:56:47.700]  transcends time.
[02:56:47.700 --> 02:56:51.340]  Tell me what a mortal technique means and I came up with that name.
[02:56:51.340 --> 02:56:57.940]  Well, originally, you know, when I was incarcerated, my name was just technique.
[02:56:57.940 --> 02:56:59.220]  That's just what I went by.
[02:56:59.220 --> 02:57:03.140]  And I always remember there was a Native American trustee named Judge.
[02:57:03.140 --> 02:57:07.980]  He brought me a pen and a paper while I was in the hole and I wrote a song on the first
[02:57:07.980 --> 02:57:14.580]  record I had called The Prophecy and I thought to myself, you know, in order for me to get
[02:57:14.580 --> 02:57:18.580]  my message across, it's going to have to span years of time.
[02:57:18.580 --> 02:57:19.740]  You know what I mean?
[02:57:19.740 --> 02:57:24.240]  What's going on right now, as you pointed out, as I pointed out through history has
[02:57:24.240 --> 02:57:25.920]  happened before.
[02:57:25.920 --> 02:57:27.560]  People have taken this away.
[02:57:27.560 --> 02:57:29.180]  People have taken that away.
[02:57:29.180 --> 02:57:31.120]  People have manipulated the system.
[02:57:31.120 --> 02:57:34.080]  People have used a proxy to get what they want done.
[02:57:34.080 --> 02:57:39.640]  People have put a smiling face off on things that really have the fangs of a vampire.
[02:57:39.640 --> 02:57:43.600]  At some point, we have to analyze this throughout history.
[02:57:43.600 --> 02:57:48.080]  And also, I'm a man who believes in God and I believe that, you know, a man that walks
[02:57:48.080 --> 02:57:49.860]  with God can walk anywhere.
[02:57:49.860 --> 02:57:51.020]  So I don't fear death.
[02:57:51.020 --> 02:57:55.860]  I don't fear people trying to marginalize my point in my perspective because I challenge
[02:57:55.860 --> 02:58:00.580]  them to meet me on the field of intellectual battle anytime, anywhere.
[02:58:00.580 --> 02:58:06.220]  Just give me, you know, a few days notice so, you know, I can buy your mother a suit.
[02:58:06.220 --> 02:58:07.220]  That's all.
[02:58:07.220 --> 02:58:08.220]  Oh, man.
[02:58:08.220 --> 02:58:11.600]  Well, listen, you got to promise me that whenever you come through Texas, you'll come into the
[02:58:11.600 --> 02:58:15.920]  studio and you got to promise every couple of months you'll come on via video Skype.
[02:58:15.920 --> 02:58:17.180]  I'll try my best, man.
[02:58:17.180 --> 02:58:18.340]  Thank you very much for having me on.
[02:58:18.340 --> 02:58:19.340]  You bet.
[02:58:19.340 --> 02:58:20.340]  It's been amazing.
[02:58:20.340 --> 02:58:21.340]  Thank you very much.
[02:58:21.340 --> 02:58:22.340]  Thank you.
[02:58:22.340 --> 02:58:23.340]  Very powerful info wars.
[02:58:23.340 --> 02:58:24.340]  Free Palestine.
[02:58:24.340 --> 02:58:26.280]  All the immigrants can't demonize us all.
[02:58:26.280 --> 02:58:28.280]  This is a nation of immigrants.
[02:58:28.280 --> 02:58:31.220]  Read between the lines info wars, the mortal technique.
[02:58:31.220 --> 02:58:32.220]  Alex Jones.
[02:58:32.220 --> 02:58:37.440]  Put your hands up because you can only get them back when you stand up deep in the trenches
[02:58:37.440 --> 02:58:41.940]  in the heart of the war, that's the place the martyr is born.
[02:58:41.940 --> 02:58:46.200]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
