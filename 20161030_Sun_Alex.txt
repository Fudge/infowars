[00:00.000 --> 00:11.560]  We're going to be here live for the next two hours with some of the biggest breaking news
[00:11.560 --> 00:15.880]  ever concerning this republic, not just what's happened to Hillary Clinton.
[00:15.880 --> 00:19.080]  We've got the inside scoop from every angle.
[00:19.080 --> 00:21.960]  It's all coming up right after this special report.
[00:21.960 --> 00:28.560]  FBI Director James Comey in a surprising letter to Congress laid out the vague details
[00:28.560 --> 00:34.280]  of the possibility of a reopening of an FBI investigation into newly discovered Clinton
[00:34.280 --> 00:40.160]  emails from Hillary Clinton's national security-threatening personal email server, Demacul.
[00:40.160 --> 00:45.240]  The letter addressed to a swath of congressional chairman read, in previous congressional
[00:45.240 --> 00:50.440]  testimony, I refer to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation had completed its
[00:50.440 --> 00:54.520]  investigation of former Secretary Clinton's personal email server.
[00:54.520 --> 00:59.680]  Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony.
[00:59.680 --> 01:05.280]  In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails
[01:05.280 --> 01:08.040]  that appear to be pertinent to the investigation.
[01:08.040 --> 01:13.720]  I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed
[01:13.720 --> 01:20.080]  that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review
[01:20.080 --> 01:26.360]  these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess
[01:26.360 --> 01:29.240]  their importance to our investigation.
[01:29.240 --> 01:34.000]  Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and
[01:34.000 --> 01:38.120]  I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe
[01:38.120 --> 01:43.760]  it is important to update your committee about our efforts in light of my previous testimony.
[01:43.760 --> 01:49.800]  FBI Director James Comey stated, Republican Congressman Jason Chaffetz, who led an oversight
[01:49.800 --> 01:54.640]  committee effort to pursue perjury charges against Hillary, immediately tweeted about
[01:54.640 --> 01:56.400]  the FBI's announcement.
[01:56.400 --> 02:02.480]  It read, FBI Director Justin Formy, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that
[02:02.480 --> 02:05.280]  appear to be pertinent to the investigation.
[02:05.280 --> 02:06.680]  Case reopened.
[02:06.680 --> 02:10.040]  The campaign trail was thrown into chaos by the news.
[02:10.040 --> 02:17.120]  When this news of the FBI's investigation, when it just happened a little while ago,
[02:17.120 --> 02:23.360]  they said, Mr. Trump, I think they'd understand, we could skip your speech in New Hampshire.
[02:23.360 --> 02:24.360]  This is so big.
[02:24.360 --> 02:32.520]  I said, I don't have the courage to skip the speech in New Hampshire, believe me.
[02:32.520 --> 02:34.440]  I don't have the courage.
[02:34.440 --> 02:40.640]  I think whatever is going on here sets up a first term that is going to be a really
[02:40.640 --> 02:47.200]  raucous one filled with more investigations, maybe impeachment proceedings.
[02:47.200 --> 02:50.560]  You've got to believe somebody's going to want to do that, right, Robert?
[02:50.560 --> 02:54.840]  Well, it's actually already been articulated and signaled by House Oversight Committee
[02:54.840 --> 02:57.360]  Chairman Jason Chaffetz, a Republican of Utah.
[02:57.360 --> 03:03.000]  He's talking about ramping up GOP investigations in the new year, should Secretary Clinton win.
[03:03.000 --> 03:08.320]  And we don't know if these emails pertain to her time while she was State Department.
[03:08.320 --> 03:10.120]  We just don't have any more information at this time.
[03:10.120 --> 03:15.000]  Okay, really, so you're just mystified by this whole thing?
[03:15.000 --> 03:19.520]  We're mystified, but we're unaware.
[03:19.520 --> 03:23.640]  And Hillary, as expected, went on business as usual.
[03:23.640 --> 03:31.200]  When you question the very institutions of our democracy going back to the founding of
[03:31.200 --> 03:36.760]  our country, you are attacking democracy.
[03:36.760 --> 03:43.480]  Now we have seen Donald Trump attack so many different kinds of Americans.
[03:43.480 --> 03:49.400]  We cannot just blow off what he's saying, because he still is saying it.
[03:49.400 --> 03:56.640]  He's standing up in front of large crowds, and you can see how he's egging them on, talking
[03:56.640 --> 04:02.160]  about rigged elections, talking about how we should just cancel the election and make
[04:02.160 --> 04:04.160]  him president.
[04:04.160 --> 04:12.160]  Right, yeah, well, we've got to be vigilant about this.
[04:12.160 --> 04:18.560]  This is not something to be made light of, because there have been too many times in
[04:18.560 --> 04:24.640]  world history where somebody gets elected, and then that's the last election that is
[04:24.640 --> 04:25.640]  held.
[04:25.640 --> 04:31.800]  So we have to not only stand up for whoever our candidates are, we have to stand up for
[04:31.800 --> 04:36.640]  the process of electing them, because that's how we lead ourselves.
[04:36.640 --> 04:40.400]  That's how we make decisions together.
[04:40.400 --> 04:45.360]  Hillary's campaign has been nothing short of a parade of corruption and bottomless scandals
[04:45.360 --> 04:50.280]  morphing into her platform as she runs for the highest office in the land.
[04:50.280 --> 04:55.920]  At what point do the American people become an accessory to Hillary's crimes by simply
[04:55.920 --> 04:57.320]  voting for her?
[04:57.320 --> 05:26.880]  John Bound for Infowars.com.
[05:26.880 --> 05:54.260]  See you.
[05:54.260 --> 06:00.500]  Visit infowarslife.com at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[06:12.500 --> 06:20.180]  It's Sunday, October 30th, 2016. We are now only eight days out from the most important election
[06:20.180 --> 06:24.820]  in modern world history. You're listening to our show, show, show.
[06:28.580 --> 06:34.340]  That's right. If you count election day, it's nine days. We are less than 10 days out bottom line
[06:34.340 --> 06:40.340]  from knowing for the new president of the United States is maybe. Because with this race so close
[06:40.340 --> 06:44.340]  according to mainstream media and all these different cooked polls, looks like it's going to be
[06:44.340 --> 06:51.780]  contested. And Antonin Scalia, who was the tiebreaker, so the George W. Bush got into office in 2000,
[06:51.780 --> 06:57.940]  he is dead. And we've got lots of talk the day before he died in the Podesta emails about wet
[06:57.940 --> 07:03.860]  work. That means assassination. Isn't it a very interesting time to be alive, obviously? We have
[07:03.860 --> 07:11.140]  the head of the Justice Department, the AG, Loretta Lynch declaring the Fifth Amendment.
[07:11.140 --> 07:15.780]  That's hardly gotten any attention declaring that she won't talk about certain things because
[07:15.780 --> 07:21.460]  it would self incriminate her. You shouldn't have an attorney general who's taken the Fifth
[07:21.460 --> 07:28.020]  to Congress. That's always a big sign that your country is in deep, deep trouble. We've got that.
[07:28.020 --> 07:34.420]  Obviously, we've got the huge investigation into Hillary. I have talked to a lot of people.
[07:34.420 --> 07:39.140]  I made a lot of phone calls, a lot of smart folks in the federal government, outside of the federal
[07:39.140 --> 07:44.900]  government, people that have sources even higher level than I do. And we have it from sources as
[07:44.900 --> 07:50.820]  high as it gets, exactly what's happening. And what's happening is panic. Comey is hedging his
[07:50.820 --> 07:56.420]  bet because all the evidence shows a landslide for Donald Trump, which is very hard to steal
[07:56.420 --> 08:02.740]  in eight, nine days. That's the bottom line. We know that last Monday, one of the new data
[08:02.740 --> 08:07.220]  dumps came out from WikiLeaks from Podesta's emails, her chief of staff, where he said,
[08:07.220 --> 08:11.700]  I can't believe how illegal this is. We should draw in quarter the folks that are involved in
[08:11.700 --> 08:16.820]  this. Who the hell told Hillary she can do this? It's totally illegal. It's got her staff saying,
[08:16.820 --> 08:20.420]  we got to cover this up in the White House saying, yes, cover it up. The president's using an
[08:20.420 --> 08:24.420]  illegal email too. He's called everybody. He doesn't have one. They're going to catch us.
[08:24.980 --> 08:30.660]  I mean, this all came out Monday on top of everything else, them calling black people dumb
[08:30.660 --> 08:37.460]  and their constituents dumb. I mean, every day, mega information comes out that if Trump had
[08:37.460 --> 08:42.500]  one of these, it'd be over. They have hundreds and hundreds and hundreds, like I've asked Paul
[08:42.500 --> 08:47.140]  Watson tomorrow to come out with the 20 most important WikiLeaks concerning this election.
[08:47.140 --> 08:52.260]  And that sounds like a lot. That is out of hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and
[08:52.260 --> 08:56.180]  hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of thousands of these things with them rigging
[08:56.180 --> 09:02.740]  the polls and rigging the media and wanting to make us poor and wanting to keep us dumb. I mean,
[09:02.740 --> 09:08.260]  they say, we got to keep them poor. We got to keep them dumb. We've got to keep them absolutely
[09:08.260 --> 09:12.500]  hopeless. We've got to keep them in the dark. We got to keep them distracted. These are words
[09:12.500 --> 09:17.860]  they use for us. And then you see their supporters, mentally ill.
[09:17.860 --> 09:28.820]  You see the supporters like absolute Stockholm victims. And they're not like
[09:29.460 --> 09:34.980]  Stockholm victims. They are. Stockholm syndrome happens, especially with women,
[09:35.540 --> 09:40.180]  where if you have a kidnapper or you have somebody that has basically taken control
[09:40.180 --> 09:45.780]  of your life and is abusing you, you then decide that you are going to support them.
[09:45.780 --> 09:50.100]  You then decide that you are going to submit to them and go along with what they're doing
[09:50.100 --> 09:55.060]  and what they want to carry out. But before I get to any of this, an emergency report I filed
[09:55.060 --> 10:00.500]  yesterday is up on infowars.com. And quite frankly, it's more important than all of this.
[10:01.060 --> 10:04.260]  It's more important than all the other distractions. I'm going to the vaccine piece.
[10:04.900 --> 10:11.700]  It is more important than even the selection because it deals with the eugenics, medical
[10:11.700 --> 10:18.020]  tyranny behind the scenes that is pulling the strings. Here is part of this bombshell report
[10:18.020 --> 10:47.460]  that needs to be spread. It's at infowars.com.
[10:48.340 --> 11:00.500]  Ladies and gentlemen, I am going to give you information that is absolutely 100% life and
[11:00.500 --> 11:07.620]  death. And I'm begging all of you, especially parents, grandparents, siblings, you name it,
[11:08.260 --> 11:12.420]  of unborn and small children to listen to me very, very carefully.
[11:12.420 --> 11:21.300]  I have researched with in-depth analysis what's really happening in this country,
[11:21.300 --> 11:27.380]  but also around the world. And it is the most horrific criminal murderous cover-up
[11:28.020 --> 11:34.900]  that this planet's ever seen. There is a covert holocaust going on of secret testing on humanity.
[11:35.460 --> 11:40.260]  Everybody knows about Tuskegee and secretly shooting black people up with Cephalus over 45
[11:40.260 --> 11:45.060]  years. Everybody knows about secret radiation testing on kids in the U.S. And what Joseph
[11:45.060 --> 11:50.020]  Mingla did with the Nazis and what the Soviets did. Ladies and gentlemen, it's going on today
[11:50.020 --> 11:58.180]  bigger than ever and no one is even covering it. Now, I saw an article in the L.A. Times today
[11:59.060 --> 12:02.980]  saying hundreds and hundreds of children suddenly when they're about a year old,
[12:04.340 --> 12:09.940]  stop moving or two years old, stop walking and then they stop breathing and then some die
[12:09.940 --> 12:16.020]  and we don't know what's happening. Ladies and gentlemen, I saw this done 10 years ago
[12:16.020 --> 12:21.380]  in Pakistan and in other areas of Central Asia where they would go and give polio vaccine.
[12:21.380 --> 12:25.140]  It would actually cause polio and then they would announce that they didn't know why everybody was
[12:25.140 --> 12:29.940]  getting paralyzed. Then other aid groups would go and test and find out they were getting polio
[12:29.940 --> 12:34.020]  from the shots. Just Google it. We can put it on screen. Children got by the tens of thousands
[12:34.020 --> 12:40.500]  polio from the shot. Now, you look at here in the United States, it's a combo of things. But if you
[12:40.500 --> 12:45.140]  read the flu shot insert or the tetanus shot insert or any of the major inserts, it says
[12:46.020 --> 12:51.060]  causes Guillain-Barre's and other neurological disorders, which are your hands, your feet
[12:51.060 --> 12:55.780]  becoming numb, then you can't walk, then you become paralyzed. In some cases you die, but not
[12:55.780 --> 13:00.500]  generally. They're not telling people there's treatments for Guillain-Barre. These doctors
[13:00.500 --> 13:04.820]  know. Now listen, Rob do about two years ago interviewed some of the nurses that contacted us
[13:05.940 --> 13:11.140]  and they told us how in the preemie wards, they're ordered to give the preemies vaccines,
[13:11.140 --> 13:13.940]  which never short happened until five years ago and they all get them ready to put them on
[13:13.940 --> 13:18.580]  respirators because they follow the orders and give them the shot and then they stop breathing
[13:19.220 --> 13:25.460]  and prepare to die. We'll link to that interview here. That's what's so crazy is that they know
[13:25.460 --> 13:29.380]  until five years ago you never gave a pregnant woman a vaccine. I was talking to a pregnant lady
[13:29.380 --> 13:33.060]  today and I said, if they actually got vaccines yet, she goes, yeah, they keep telling me pregnant
[13:33.060 --> 13:37.060]  women need more. And I go, did you know until five years ago, they said never give it to pregnant
[13:37.060 --> 13:40.500]  women. She goes, I know, I know. And her husband's like, absolutely, we'll never do that.
[13:41.460 --> 13:46.980]  Ladies and gentlemen, they are practicing getting doctors and nurses and everyone to go along
[13:46.980 --> 13:52.260]  with this entire program when the insert says vaccines cause Guillain-Barre's, especially in
[13:52.260 --> 13:57.700]  children. They're testing to see how many children they can give neurological disorders
[13:57.700 --> 14:04.260]  and see if the nurses and doctors in public don't notice. They're testing soft kill on the public
[14:04.260 --> 14:09.300]  to see if they can manage massive numbers of dead and dying and main children.
[14:10.260 --> 14:14.420]  Again, the doctors and nurses aren't even involved. They're command and controlled,
[14:14.420 --> 14:17.860]  told from the top down. And this is a huge test to see what they can get away with.
[14:18.660 --> 14:22.260]  We've gone from one in 30,000 with autism 36 years ago.
[14:22.260 --> 14:28.740]  Now, in the year 2016, one in 58 American children has autism. In South Korea, it's like something,
[14:28.740 --> 14:31.700]  like one in 30. Look it up. In fact, the numbers are getting worse.
[14:32.740 --> 14:38.180]  This is assaulting us. It's causing autoimmune releases in the brain, swelling on the brain.
[14:38.740 --> 14:43.540]  And in the young, it's causing them to be paralyzed. Guillain-Barre is only one of the
[14:43.540 --> 14:47.140]  problems on the insert, but they go to the doctors and they're not allowed to say it now.
[14:47.140 --> 14:50.580]  They're told by the hospitals. So they go, we don't know why. We don't know why.
[14:50.580 --> 14:53.940]  But inside the hospitals, the doctors who reached out to us, the nurses have as well,
[14:54.580 --> 14:57.620]  they know it's the vaccines. They know it's an autoimmune response because they've gone from
[14:57.620 --> 15:02.740]  like 15 vaccines. They wanted to give them 20 years ago to 40, 50, 60. Now they want to do 100
[15:02.740 --> 15:07.140]  by 2020. They're talking about people getting thousands of vaccines by 2025.
[15:08.500 --> 15:12.260]  And then as people die and become brain damaged, they play dumb and go, we don't know why.
[15:12.820 --> 15:18.740]  Ladies and gentlemen, Japan has banned giving vaccines until 18 months. Other countries have
[15:18.740 --> 15:23.380]  banned Gardasil that's been killing little girls around the world. Don't believe me. This is life
[15:23.380 --> 15:28.660]  and death. If you care about your kids, look into it and find out for yourself. They know the mystery.
[15:28.660 --> 15:32.900]  They know why. And the doctors and nurses are telling us their order not to tell the people.
[15:34.260 --> 15:38.500]  I'm here on Saturday night. That's right. I shot that last night. There's a couple more minutes
[15:38.500 --> 15:43.300]  of the report. If you're a radio listener, it has news articles, documentation that the government
[15:43.300 --> 15:50.260]  knows that millions of people are brain damaged a year in the U.S. alone from vaccines. The polio
[15:50.260 --> 15:56.260]  vaccine alone, they admit of the 70s killed 100 plus million Americans with cancer. It killed you.
[15:57.220 --> 16:02.900]  So you are being murdered. That's a fact. I'm Alex Jones with a simple question. Will you and
[16:02.900 --> 16:07.460]  your family be financially protected if there's another economic meltdown like many experts?
[16:07.460 --> 16:12.580]  I believe another devastating crash is coming. I think it's a matter of when not if don't wait
[16:12.580 --> 16:16.820]  for another crisis that could wipe out your hard earned money. Do what I did and call United States

[19:59.300 --> 20:11.620]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:16.500 --> 20:25.140]  Fear is the passion of slaves and this man knows no fear. He is Alex Jones.
[20:25.140 --> 20:29.940]  Yeah, that's one of the few liners I didn't write. I know a lot of fear.
[20:32.660 --> 20:37.620]  I know the fear of turning my soul over to evil and submitting to this tyranny.
[20:38.420 --> 20:43.460]  And I know the fear of seeing my fellow citizens and my fellow humans acting like zombies.
[20:43.460 --> 20:48.500]  Here's an example before I spend the entire rest of the hour and a half after this next break
[20:48.500 --> 20:55.220]  of the broadcast on the Hillary situation, the election, the inside baseball, the inside scoop.
[20:55.220 --> 21:00.500]  We've got it. We've got the inside scoop, the best thinking on it and what's currently happening
[21:00.500 --> 21:05.380]  coming up with Larry Nichols and Roger Stone and more today. Larry Nichols at the start of the next
[21:05.380 --> 21:12.340]  segment. But we put out a campaign ad dealing with the fact that Hillary's called for major war
[21:12.340 --> 21:18.900]  with Russia and others. That is undoubtedly the most powerful campaign ad of 2016.
[21:22.740 --> 21:27.540]  And the name of the video is this might be the wildest campaign ad I've ever seen.
[21:29.300 --> 21:34.500]  And it deals with World War Three. Now on Facebook, on one version of it, it has two million
[21:34.500 --> 21:41.860]  plus views, 2.3 million. Now to most people, that is a super ultra viral video.
[21:42.420 --> 21:45.300]  I mean, Donald Trump thinks the video with a million views is viral.
[21:45.860 --> 21:50.820]  We have videos with 50 million, 30 million, 20 million, 18 million, 16 million, 10 million.
[21:53.860 --> 21:56.900]  Every week we have videos with five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10 million.
[21:56.900 --> 22:01.060]  Every month we have videos with 15, 20 million. We have had videos with 30 million,
[22:01.060 --> 22:07.060]  40 million, 50 million, 60 million, 80 million, 100 million before, many times.
[22:07.060 --> 22:14.180]  I've only had one with over 100 million once. But the point is that whenever I want something to go
[22:14.180 --> 22:20.100]  super viral, it doesn't go viral. And then when it's something's important, but not as important as
[22:20.100 --> 22:25.060]  other issues, it gets a 500,000 views, 2 million views, 3 million views. And the reason this is
[22:25.060 --> 22:29.620]  important is we have 3, 4, 5 million, depending on which day of the week it is, people tuning into
[22:29.620 --> 22:34.100]  the radio show. You're the hardcore, awake Americans and people globally that understand
[22:34.100 --> 22:38.820]  what's happening. You're the brain trust in global resistance against these tyrants. You're a godsend.
[22:40.820 --> 22:45.540]  But on YouTube and Facebook, we reach people that have never been reached in many cases with the
[22:45.540 --> 22:58.900]  truth. And we reach them with incontrovertible evidence. We show people the WikiLeaks emails
[22:58.900 --> 23:04.260]  that the media isn't covering, or they call you stupid, or they say they want you poor,
[23:04.260 --> 23:08.740]  or they say they want to hurt you, or they say that they want to bankrupt the nation to control
[23:08.740 --> 23:14.820]  us, or they say black people are dumb, or they admit they're engaged in criminal activity.
[23:16.180 --> 23:23.060]  One of these will bring them down. We have thousands. We put videos out that get millions
[23:23.060 --> 23:29.540]  of views. I mean, I put out eight videos yesterday that all total have about 2 million views if you
[23:29.540 --> 23:34.020]  go and tally it up. So I feel good. I could sleep last night knowing what's going on,
[23:34.020 --> 23:38.660]  only because I had 2 million extra views. I must have 50 million. I must have 100 million.
[23:38.660 --> 23:45.700]  If you think I'm joking, I'm not. I'm not up here to lose this thing, okay? I know how evil they
[23:45.700 --> 23:50.260]  are. Now I'm going to speak very slowly and very clearly because I'm so pissed right now. I'm about
[23:50.260 --> 23:55.620]  to walk off time to the show. There's nothing to do with you, or even the audience, or the crew.
[23:57.540 --> 24:03.380]  It's that I am a bad person because I care, and that scene is sick today.
[24:04.260 --> 24:09.060]  And I'm not up here saying I'm a bad person because I want to make a joke out of or be satirical.
[24:10.020 --> 24:14.260]  I am a bad person compared to the average person. I am the immoral person that cares.
[24:14.260 --> 24:18.500]  I'm the immoral person that's informed. I'm the immoral person that's involved. I'm the immoral
[24:18.500 --> 24:25.540]  person that's right 99% of the time. I'm the person that just can't roll over and be unconscious
[24:25.540 --> 24:30.660]  and watch pure evil carried out. But if you're in a world of evil, it sees you as bad. And I'm
[24:30.660 --> 24:35.620]  getting to realize this is your planet. It's what you want, and you want to be part of it.
[24:36.660 --> 24:42.900]  And so you're going to get hurt real bad. What am I talking about? The other worldliness
[24:42.900 --> 24:51.620]  that every major vaccine insert, for every major vaccine says it can cause neurological
[24:51.620 --> 24:58.980]  disorders, epilepsy, Guillain-Barre, narcalism, on and on and on. It can eat your pancreas and
[24:58.980 --> 25:02.900]  give you a permanent pancreatitis and give you type 1 diabetes. They'll tell you that's
[25:02.900 --> 25:04.820]  quote genetic. Well, hell yeah, they eat your pancreas.
[25:04.820 --> 25:11.780]  Smoke five packs of cigarettes a day, probably get lung cancer too. The point is,
[25:13.140 --> 25:19.780]  I know it's no mystery that we've gone from one in 30 something thousand kids with autism,
[25:19.780 --> 25:24.900]  now one in 50 something. I know our IQs are dropping. I know brain tumors are up. I was driving
[25:24.900 --> 25:29.140]  back from Houston this weekend down there doing work, and I saw billboards everywhere about this
[25:29.140 --> 25:35.460]  doctor specializes in children's brain tumors. This doctor specializes in children's lung tumors,
[25:35.460 --> 25:39.380]  because see years 50, 60, 70, you get that stuff. You're not going to spend your whole
[25:39.380 --> 25:42.740]  family's money. They know with your kids, you'll give everything you got for them.
[25:43.300 --> 25:47.540]  And so there's all the big billboards. Nothing about why it's happening. Nothing about why
[25:47.540 --> 25:55.700]  pediatric cancer 55 years ago was maybe one in 10 million. Doctors would get on airplanes and fly
[25:55.700 --> 26:02.580]  across the country to see a child with cancer. Period. It did not exist. It was like finding a
[26:02.580 --> 26:10.980]  10 leafed clover. Now you walk down your street for about an hour, you'll walk by kids outside
[26:10.980 --> 26:16.180]  playing with the chemotherapy injectors on their chest, their hair out, all preparing to die.
[26:16.980 --> 26:22.340]  I have the government documents. I have the soft kill data. I've published it. I've made films that
[26:22.340 --> 26:27.060]  have been seen 20 million times like in game where they sit there and admit they're putting
[26:27.060 --> 26:33.140]  cancer viruses in your vaccines. They sit there and they admit all this. They know full well
[26:33.140 --> 26:37.700]  that all major vaccines are linked to Guillain-Barre and cause it. And then they sit there in the LA
[26:37.700 --> 26:43.300]  Times and the New York Times and go, gee, we don't know why hundreds of kids in LA alone,
[26:43.300 --> 26:51.700]  just since school started, suddenly can't walk or brain dead. Gee, first their hands,
[26:51.700 --> 26:55.620]  kid says in the article, first their hands got numb, then their feet, then their legs,
[26:55.620 --> 26:59.940]  and they couldn't walk, then they couldn't move. Then some of them died. Gee, what's that? The
[26:59.940 --> 27:06.340]  doctors go, gee, pears, creepers, we don't know. It's a neurological disorder in the Guillain-Barre
[27:06.340 --> 27:12.500]  spectrum. They know the vaccine insert says it. They're trying to pass along Congress, this Congress,
[27:13.140 --> 27:19.620]  to remove any advice in the vaccines period on the insert. So you won't even be told that.
[27:19.620 --> 27:23.860]  We got copies. We saved them, though. Don't worry. They'll come to time. We'll be arrested for
[27:23.860 --> 27:27.780]  telling you, though, when you're wondering why everyone around you's dying, everyone around
[27:27.780 --> 27:34.340]  you's falling apart. So here's why I'm pissed off. I put out that video that's got four or five million
[27:34.340 --> 27:41.300]  views, maybe more about nuclear war. It's very important, very powerful. It's the most powerful
[27:41.300 --> 27:47.460]  ad of this season, undoubtedly. It's so truth-based. And it's got, again, 2.3 million on one platform,
[27:47.460 --> 27:53.380]  5 million or so, maybe more on all the other platforms. Now, you go to YouTube and you also
[27:53.380 --> 27:59.940]  go to Facebook and look. Mystery of paralyzed and dying children discovered. Because the LA Times
[27:59.940 --> 28:04.660]  had the headline, Mystery. Hundreds of children becoming paralyzed. They changed the headline.
[28:04.660 --> 28:08.820]  I guess it was too interesting, too. Her toddler suddenly paralyzed. Mother tries to solve a
[28:08.820 --> 28:17.060]  vexing medical mystery with hundreds of other parents in LA. LA Times. 35,000 views, since I
[28:17.060 --> 28:21.940]  put that up here. It says to be 10 million. We would save every kid in this country. But see,
[28:21.940 --> 28:28.020]  no one cares. They're not tied into it like you are the election. You bring this down. You'll bring
[28:28.020 --> 28:32.580]  the whole shadow government down behind it that's doing this on purpose. And I have all the documents.
[28:32.580 --> 28:36.980]  You might want to watch my film end game. So of course I'm angry. Of course I'm upset. I'm normal.
[28:36.980 --> 28:42.980]  I'm not a psychotic killer. So 35,000 right there. And then we have articles in there from previous
[28:42.980 --> 28:47.860]  interviews with nurses. Hospital vaccine is causing babies to stop breathing. They've already
[28:47.860 --> 28:52.100]  gone public. They know all the nurses and doctors know they're told they'll be fired if they tell
[28:52.100 --> 28:56.660]  you keep giving the shot. The few kids that die is better for everybody else for the greater good.
[28:56.660 --> 28:59.540]  But the vaccine doesn't even help you. It's a mass secret program.
[28:59.540 --> 29:15.460]  A CBS Chicago investigation finds dead people voting in Chicago. Susie Sallie died in 1998,
[29:15.460 --> 29:22.020]  but voted in Chicago 12 years later. Victor Croswalk died in 1994. He's voted six times since.
[29:22.020 --> 29:27.700]  Floyd Stevens passed in 1993, but records have him showing up to the polls 11 times since then.
[29:27.700 --> 29:33.860]  Earl Smith, today's CSLA are also amongst the 119 deceased voters that have cast ballots,
[29:33.860 --> 29:41.300]  a total of 229 times in Chicago over the last decade. May they rest in peace. Jim Allen,
[29:41.300 --> 29:46.740]  a city election board spokesperson said, this isn't the bad old days. No, I guess it's the
[29:46.740 --> 29:52.580]  good new days where you can get away with election fraud. So CBS has now reported finding dead voters
[29:52.580 --> 29:58.340]  in Chicago, Denver, and Los Angeles. Where next? This is Owen Schreuer for infowars.com.

[31:15.700 --> 31:20.820]  Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant. One out of three
[31:20.820 --> 31:24.900]  or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone knows at least one person

[32:03.460 --> 32:08.900]  in, one of the biggest issues nobody's talking about in the debates or anywhere is the vulnerability
[32:08.900 --> 32:16.500]  of the power grid. The potential for power grid chaos. EMP, cyber warfare, not to mention dangerous
[32:16.500 --> 32:22.580]  weather, hurricanes, ice storms, all a very real threat to our grid. My friend's chaos is already
[32:22.580 --> 32:27.380]  here and it's going to get a lot worse. That's why I believe that all my listeners need to have a

[33:04.900 --> 33:11.620]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:11.620 --> 33:40.740]  This is our land. These are our people. The workers. The strivers. The builders. These are our people.
[33:40.740 --> 33:51.060]  They are the dark armies. The dark murdering armies. The only honor is atrocities.
[33:52.580 --> 33:59.140]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[34:02.100 --> 34:04.740]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[34:04.740 --> 34:09.540]  All right. I'm going to spin the rest of the broadcast next hour and a half,
[34:09.540 --> 34:14.660]  exclusively on the huge Hillary Clinton revelations. Every angle of it and the inside
[34:14.660 --> 34:20.580]  intel we've got. We're going to do that in just a moment. But the reason I get angry is
[34:22.340 --> 34:26.980]  I have empathy for everybody. I know about medical tyranny. I know about the Soviet Union
[34:26.980 --> 34:31.860]  and Nazi Germany. They were giving people inoculations that add compounds to it.
[34:31.860 --> 34:36.020]  The same thing was done with the Tuskegee Black folks in Alabama,
[34:36.020 --> 34:41.700]  over 45 years being given vaccines full of live syphilis. My grandmother got polio from the polio
[34:41.700 --> 34:47.140]  vaccine. They told her that, almost killed her. She's 91 years old today and is in a wheelchair,
[34:47.140 --> 34:52.900]  but been in a wheelchair since the 50s. Now that said, everybody knows vaccines hurt people. Everybody
[34:52.900 --> 34:58.260]  knows about the quote side effects. Now they've ratcheted up how many they give to where there's
[34:58.260 --> 35:01.940]  all these neurological problems. Kids getting paralyzed everywhere and they won't even give
[35:01.940 --> 35:05.220]  the people treatment because they don't want to admit it's the medical system doing it.
[35:06.100 --> 35:09.860]  And in the video I filed yesterday, I can't even take off a day. I'm not complaining.
[35:09.860 --> 35:15.140]  This is what I want to do. I'm crazed. I saw pregnant women walking around with their husbands
[35:15.140 --> 35:19.780]  and I come and say, have they told you to take shots? And they'd say, yeah, but I've heard it's
[35:19.780 --> 35:24.580]  bad. I'm like, don't husbands like, yeah, I see another pregnant lady. I do it in grocery stores.
[35:24.580 --> 35:28.820]  My kids see a pregnant lady in grocery store. They go, oh, dad, but they don't need more.
[35:28.820 --> 35:33.380]  Now they start telling them, I'm a normal person until five years ago. They said,
[35:33.380 --> 35:37.300]  don't give a pregnant woman a vaccine. It can cause brain damage, deformities,
[35:37.300 --> 35:42.020]  or it can cause a miscarriage of the first trimester. Every medical doctor would tell you that.
[35:42.020 --> 35:45.700]  Now everything's directed by insurance companies. They say, no, you know what? It's a good thing.
[35:45.700 --> 35:50.260]  Do it. And infant mortality is going way up. We got the worst infant mortality in the industrialized
[35:50.260 --> 35:58.740]  world. We have the best after Sweden until 20 years ago. We are being hit. And when I see the news,
[35:58.740 --> 36:05.300]  why? Oh, CBS news. Oh, why LA times? Oh, these kids are dying and can't walk. And all of a sudden,
[36:05.300 --> 36:10.260]  they're three or four years old. Suddenly they can't walk. And then they stop breathing and they die.
[36:12.100 --> 36:16.180]  I've had the nurses on. My other reporters have, we've had the doctors, the whistleblowers on. In
[36:16.180 --> 36:20.420]  fact, more of you contact us. They tell them, get rid of all the premies, their vaccines. They go,
[36:20.420 --> 36:24.260]  but they stop breathing. They go, just, we're going to have to kill them. It's an order.
[36:24.980 --> 36:30.260]  It's an order by the bioethics board, by the company that owns us. It's a directive.
[36:31.380 --> 36:35.860]  And then what's, how about a cult? They then give them the shots, get the respirators reader and
[36:35.860 --> 36:41.780]  put them on respirators. I mean, I have the interviews with the eyewitnesses. This is the
[36:41.780 --> 36:47.380]  insanity we're already going through in this country. Just like I told you the NSA was keyword
[36:47.380 --> 36:52.100]  data, mining everything you do, all declassified, all public. Just like I told you about all the
[36:52.100 --> 36:56.020]  whistleblowers and I told you about how the secret of the border was wide open and they were already
[36:56.020 --> 37:00.100]  legalizing people two years before it was in the news. I know what I'm talking about.
[37:00.980 --> 37:07.220]  I don't say that to beat my chest and go, I'm smart. The inserts of the vaccine say it'll give you
[37:07.220 --> 37:15.540]  a paralyzed limbs, a good portion of the time. And as they increase the vaccines, as they increase
[37:15.540 --> 37:19.460]  the number, it's going to happen. Now he's with us till 20 minutes in the next hour. Then Roger
[37:19.460 --> 37:27.300]  Stone joins us, former head of the Trump campaign to break down huge developments with what's
[37:27.300 --> 37:32.500]  happening with Hillary. This story is giant. WikiLeaks proves what we already knew. They're
[37:32.500 --> 37:39.140]  running the mainstream media. They're running secret emails with Obama and he's been caught.
[37:39.140 --> 37:43.860]  That's the big bomb show last Monday. That's why the FBI is in full mutiny with the people that
[37:43.860 --> 37:47.860]  are good in there because it's open and shut. They should go to jail. Now this new investigation
[37:47.860 --> 37:53.300]  comes out so combing. There's a lot of reasons. There's a lot of calculus here, but so combing
[37:54.660 --> 37:58.420]  can now look okay. If Trump still gets in and prosecution begins,
[37:58.420 --> 38:05.300]  he won't be the guy that got reversed. So Hillary is legitimately blowing up and freaking out demonizing
[38:05.300 --> 38:11.860]  Comey, even though she knows his law firm does her taxes and their big buddies with the Clintons
[38:11.860 --> 38:17.540]  and Loretta Lynch, that this is basically a red herring investigation. Though it is tied to
[38:17.540 --> 38:22.580]  some other secret emails and does show they lied, it diverts us off of the president,
[38:22.580 --> 38:30.740]  POTUS, who's been caught in the WikiLeaks and his staff members and her staff members coming out
[38:31.860 --> 38:33.540]  and saying, ladies and gentlemen,
[38:36.100 --> 38:40.740]  that they had to quote cover this up. Now let's go to drudgereport.com right now. We have one of
[38:40.740 --> 38:47.860]  the vaunted, incredibly rare, red and blue sirens. Wall Street Journal, FBI found 6,500 emails on
[38:47.860 --> 38:52.900]  laptop and that was my next point. I saw the report earlier today detailing this. When I say
[38:53.700 --> 38:59.540]  the emails and the devices and the phone and the leader investigation is on a complete red herring,
[38:59.540 --> 39:05.300]  that's because they say it connects to a bunch of other data, 650,000. Now, is that how they're
[39:05.300 --> 39:10.740]  going to claim they got this instead of the NSA? Because look, WikiLeaks has the emails of 33,000.
[39:11.780 --> 39:17.300]  They're out there. They're getting ready to come out this week. Now the FBI says they just found
[39:17.300 --> 39:26.260]  6,000. Let's put that back on screen. 650,000 emails. That number is so big, it's hard to even imagine.
[39:30.340 --> 39:34.100]  So my friends, we're going to be deciphering all of this today as we go.
[39:36.660 --> 39:40.660]  We're going to be looking at every angle of this throughout the week. We're going to be
[39:40.660 --> 39:45.140]  breaking it all down and we're going to be broadcasting not just the normal four hours a
[39:45.140 --> 39:50.500]  day from 12 noon to 4 p.m. Eastern. We're going to be broadcasting with expanded live transmissions
[39:50.500 --> 39:55.700]  at 7 o'clock each night. It's not just our hour news, but expanded and we're going to broadcast
[39:55.700 --> 40:01.380]  for 50 plus hours starting not this Monday, but next Monday, right through Tuesday,
[40:01.380 --> 40:07.140]  right through Wednesday, because there's so many angles to this. What happens if Hillary tries to
[40:07.140 --> 40:12.980]  steal it? Now Larry Nichols was a former consummate insider with the Clintons. He's one of the main
[40:12.980 --> 40:18.740]  inquire sources. He got us the head of the inquire on last week. He has broken so much on this. He
[40:18.740 --> 40:24.020]  just heard my analysis. I want to see if that concurs with the intel he's getting, which I know
[40:24.020 --> 40:30.660]  goes to the highest level in the land. So thank you for joining us, Larry Nichols. Hey Alex, how are
[40:30.660 --> 40:34.260]  you? Good. I know you're battling cancer yourself or in the hospital right now. You don't want to
[40:34.260 --> 40:37.460]  get into that, but we're all praying for you, Larry. We've got three minutes to break. You'll
[40:37.460 --> 40:42.580]  have the floor when we come back. Break down your latest information. Well, let me just say
[40:42.580 --> 40:48.580]  to everybody, be careful. You were exactly right. Watch out about this new batch. And I will tell you
[40:48.580 --> 40:54.020]  what I couldn't tell you yesterday, Alex. The part of the FBI that were the informants that
[40:54.020 --> 41:00.420]  leaked the story to the Wall Street Journal are some of the same people that I talked with last
[41:00.420 --> 41:07.700]  night and this morning. And what they're telling Alex could change the dynamic of this entire race.
[41:07.700 --> 41:13.300]  Well, let's start getting into that because you said to me last night and this morning
[41:13.940 --> 41:18.180]  that, hey, they're diverting us with this wiener stuff because they're about to release something
[41:18.180 --> 41:25.140]  even bigger. So flush this out for me. Well, what's happening? Number one is Hillary was faced with
[41:25.140 --> 41:31.300]  the fact that the WikiLeaks, everyone knows was getting more and more. And what's his name is
[41:31.300 --> 41:37.540]  Saad's promise that as we got closer to the election, that they were going to get, you know,
[41:37.540 --> 41:42.740]  bigger stories, essentially, they're going to drop bigger bombshells. The Clintons have seen
[41:42.740 --> 41:48.660]  in the past week the wear that that's had on that plus the, you know, when you add that to the
[41:49.700 --> 41:57.060]  healthcare fiasco. So the one thing that they've done to help diffuse that,
[41:57.060 --> 42:02.820]  that they can't stop WikiLeaks. But Alex, what they're attempting to do is to divert attention
[42:02.820 --> 42:10.500]  from it. They're trying to suck all the oxygen, get all of the media, everyone, including Trump,
[42:10.500 --> 42:16.660]  including all of us, the people that are for Trump, get us looking for the magic bullet
[42:16.660 --> 42:27.460]  for the magic bullet in this new batch of emails. When in fact, let me give you an example,
[42:27.460 --> 42:34.180]  Hillary spent two or three years sledgehammering computers so that the emails could not be found,
[42:34.180 --> 42:38.980]  right? And all of a sudden, this time, what does Hillary do? If you want some release,
[42:38.980 --> 42:42.500]  let me stop you. We're coming right back. Drudge has the headline FBI found
[42:42.500 --> 42:48.420]  650,000 emails. Now that's from today. That broke five minutes ago info wars.com. Look at my
[42:48.420 --> 42:55.540]  headline last night, exclusive FBI mutiny reopened Clinton investigation. That was from Larry Nichols,
[42:55.540 --> 43:00.260]  one part of my source. I then called my federal sources. They said exactly what Larry told me,
[43:00.260 --> 43:03.620]  not a group you develop living defense for us. It took you over a year to do it.
[43:03.620 --> 43:08.980]  Why is this so good? Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares
[43:08.980 --> 43:14.740]  me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages
[43:14.740 --> 43:21.060]  in my system. But right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful
[43:21.060 --> 43:26.900]  to your body that lives off a host mechanism right now with all the refugees, spreading disease
[43:26.900 --> 43:31.620]  around. We have biological warfare going on everywhere. These are all parasites. Tell us
[43:31.620 --> 43:34.980]  about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it. You have the name in there.
[43:34.980 --> 43:40.420]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood. I recommend doing the parasite plans
[43:40.420 --> 43:43.940]  at least twice a year. All right, well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back
[43:43.940 --> 43:47.940]  on it today. It just came back in yesterday living defense info wars live.com and folks,
[43:47.940 --> 43:53.220]  you can't lose full of stuff that's great for your body period. And you support the broadcast
[43:53.220 --> 43:57.540]  info wars lives.com. Thank you, Dr. Group from the global healing center. Thank you so much for

[44:18.180 --> 44:21.780]  really wanted to do a good job on the interview. I got my bottle of brain force right there. I

[45:10.900 --> 45:15.220]  read a little thing here from agenda 21 that American system of justice must be changed to
[45:15.220 --> 45:20.820]  conform to the rest of the world. Individual rights will have to take a back seat to the collective.
[45:20.820 --> 45:23.780]  Well, you know what the next move is going to be, don't you? It's going to be coming after you're
[45:23.780 --> 45:29.380]  done. Oh, yeah. I take it ain't gonna sit well down my way at all. It ain't gonna sit well.
[45:29.380 --> 45:33.780]  Do you ever wonder what happened to America? It's time to ride, boys. We need a thousand
[45:33.780 --> 45:40.100]  Paul Revere's. When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage, mom and apple pie.
[45:40.100 --> 45:47.780]  And beef was for supper. Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical screenings on demand,

[46:07.300 --> 46:11.940]  Got a grip. You took years for you to develop DNA Force for us. It's been something that I've been
[46:11.940 --> 46:17.540]  working on for a long time, Alex, because I think it's very, very important. What the aging process
[46:17.540 --> 46:23.700]  is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres. Telomeres are the little
[46:23.700 --> 46:28.660]  cups on the end of our chromosomes. But when it runs out, you start dying. We chose the PQQ because
[46:28.660 --> 46:34.500]  it has over 175 different clinical trials. It's one of the most effective substances in the world.
[46:34.500 --> 46:40.660]  It works like an antioxidant. It works to repair nerve growth factor. So this is a formula to

[47:07.060 --> 47:29.620]  He aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side. You're listening to Alex
[47:29.620 --> 47:43.140]  Jones. The global is just scared to drop because they know he's a national. He's a patriot. He's
[47:43.140 --> 47:48.100]  not off to get people like they are. He's not a predator. When he gets in, it's just the beginning
[47:48.100 --> 47:53.220]  of us digging into big pharma, digging into all the big corrupt companies that have been
[47:53.220 --> 47:58.740]  screwing us over. That's going to make Nuremberg trials look like a walk in the park for these
[47:58.740 --> 48:05.620]  scumbags. I don't say that through any type of hatred of the globalist. I do it out of
[48:05.620 --> 48:12.260]  defense of the children and the innocent. The enemy we face is pure evil. Now Larry Nichols,
[48:12.980 --> 48:19.860]  I call Larry Nichols Friday and Saturday and today just to check on the latest he had. I called
[48:19.860 --> 48:26.740]  several federal sources I have. I'll just tell you FBI Secret Service and of course they didn't
[48:26.740 --> 48:30.020]  know exactly what was going on, but they said, look, we already have enough to indict them all.
[48:30.020 --> 48:34.420]  Look what came out last week. The president's involved. It's open and shut. This is Comey
[48:34.420 --> 48:38.020]  just trying to cover his butt and look good because he thinks Trump's getting in. And I call
[48:38.020 --> 48:41.300]  Nichols and I say, what do you think? He says the exact thing. I say, who did you get that from?
[48:41.300 --> 48:47.220]  Well, a high level fed. I'll just say that in the judiciary and then from the FBI and you name it.
[48:47.860 --> 48:49.620]  I said, well, what are the headlines? And he said, well,
[48:50.740 --> 48:54.100]  he said there's a huge mutiny inside the FBI over this and they got more stuff they're about to
[48:54.100 --> 48:58.900]  release and other stuff. So this is a smokescreen from that. So get ready. Here's the headline
[48:58.900 --> 49:05.700]  from last night or yesterday afternoon. I filed this FBI mutiny reopened Clinton investigation
[49:05.700 --> 49:09.860]  and we basically lay it out. It's not about tooting our horn. When we tell you, we're the news
[49:09.860 --> 49:14.180]  leaders, we get the most views, the most listeners, you have to know as an audience, we're the majority.
[49:14.180 --> 49:20.260]  You're the majority too. We're winning. That's why they're pulling this. But here's the latest
[49:20.260 --> 49:27.860]  story up on drugsreport.com. Resignation letters piling up at the FBI as more and more people
[49:27.860 --> 49:33.860]  resigned over the fact that he covered up FBI and internal feud over Hillary Clinton probe.
[49:36.820 --> 49:41.540]  So what we told you, we knew this months ago, but here it is confirmed.
[49:43.540 --> 49:48.260]  Registration letters piling up as this satisfied FBI agents, his wife urging him to admit he was
[49:48.260 --> 49:52.660]  wrong while Director Comey jumped at the chance to reopen Hillary investigation. But again,
[49:53.220 --> 49:57.220]  Hillary now says release it, release it. It gets released right before there's nothing in it,
[49:57.220 --> 50:01.220]  except for Wiener doing pervert stuff that makes her get away with it. That's exactly what
[50:01.220 --> 50:04.980]  Nichols said yesterday. So you got the floor the next 10 minutes, lay out what your sources are
[50:04.980 --> 50:09.540]  saying. And then let's get into what your big source told you, which I concur with about the
[50:09.540 --> 50:15.300]  triggering event, the Bay in Chilada, what the people behind Hillary are planning right now. Now,
[50:15.300 --> 50:21.620]  we're in such a dominant position right now. And everything they've done has turned to crap,
[50:21.620 --> 50:25.060]  because Providence is coming in folks. A lot of folks been praying a lot of good people in the
[50:25.060 --> 50:27.620]  government are doing the right thing as well. Just like Nichols said last week, he said,
[50:27.620 --> 50:32.180]  you're ready for the FBI's for coming out. They're sick of it. And so it's happening.
[50:33.060 --> 50:37.140]  But the enemy is going to strike back Larry, lay it out. Well, what they're doing Alex,
[50:37.140 --> 50:43.940]  and now this is what I got from directly from members of the FBI that are participating in the
[50:43.940 --> 50:50.980]  mutiny. There apparently is meetings, we're meeting still are between the White House,
[50:50.980 --> 50:57.940]  do not know who at the White House, read a Lynch directly, James Comey directly,
[50:58.740 --> 51:05.380]  and what they plan to do. Oh, and Podesta and several others in the Clinton campaign,
[51:05.380 --> 51:10.580]  and what they plan to do was to identify number one, the problems, problem number one, emails,
[51:11.620 --> 51:19.220]  problem number two, voter fraud. Thanks to you and others, Alex. Thanks to Donald Trump.
[51:20.420 --> 51:25.220]  Thanks to everybody that just wants free and open elections. Every major state's reporting
[51:25.220 --> 51:31.460]  flipping to Hillary, dead people voting, illegals voting. So they're seeing those two major problems
[51:31.460 --> 51:37.060]  and they kind of figure a way to come up with it. I don't know who exactly came up with the plan.
[51:37.060 --> 51:43.060]  I don't have that. But what they've determined to do was to come up, get Comey to announce that
[51:43.060 --> 51:48.900]  there was another batch of emails, the ones that they supposedly found on what's your name's computer,
[51:49.940 --> 51:56.420]  and then use that to focus everybody's attention to draw Trump and his people in to draw all of
[51:56.420 --> 52:01.780]  us in. That's the big, that's the big magic bullet. So it's like Reddit air blowing up an
[52:01.780 --> 52:05.940]  oil well that's on fire with a bunch of dynamite. You think blowing it up is the wrong thing? No,
[52:05.940 --> 52:10.660]  it's the perfect thing. Have a big explosion to divert everybody onto that and not all the
[52:10.660 --> 52:16.020]  true smoking guns that we have right in front of us. Absolutely. Now, they're trying to back us
[52:16.020 --> 52:20.740]  off of trailing voter fraud or at least staying after it. They're trying to stop the media from,
[52:20.740 --> 52:27.460]  they're trying to give the media an excuse to stay away from WikiLeaks. Now, Comey was given an option,
[52:27.460 --> 52:33.300]  apparently. He had explained to him, and the reason I know I believe this is because I needed
[52:33.300 --> 52:38.820]  to people, Alex, when I was with him. Somebody went to him and said, you know, Jim, here's the deal,
[52:38.820 --> 52:45.300]  buddy. If Hillary loses your toast, your name is toast, your career is toast, you're done,
[52:45.300 --> 52:51.220]  and there's a good chance if an investigation ensues, you will be the one going to jail. Now,
[52:51.220 --> 52:58.660]  the best thing for you to do is to help us. He had no choice. So he participates in bringing out
[52:58.660 --> 53:03.460]  this, this, uh, this diversion emails, this diversion. No, no, no, no, let me stop you. Six
[53:03.460 --> 53:07.380]  months ago, when the little Red Elix thing happened, you've been saying for a year, there will be no
[53:07.380 --> 53:11.700]  indictment, there will be no indictment. They'll put and gave her a letter, a list of FBI people
[53:11.700 --> 53:16.180]  and prosecutors they got dirt on, and boy, you were proven right. So you're saying again,
[53:17.060 --> 53:22.820]  you know, what transpired? Yeah. Now, the plan is, and you'll notice that even
[53:23.540 --> 53:29.700]  when they did this, the miraculous change took place. Number one, Mr. Good Guy, James Comey,
[53:29.700 --> 53:35.140]  who's everybody said is Mr. Impeccable. The first thing he does, he breaks the 60 day rule.
[53:35.140 --> 53:42.820]  60 day rule means back going back to Iran contra, you know, arms for hostages. After that election
[53:42.820 --> 53:47.460]  with Carter, the media and everybody in the ethics committee said, no longer can you bring
[53:47.460 --> 53:51.700]  something out 60 days before an election. And he also leaked it. He didn't just tell Congress
[53:51.700 --> 53:59.380]  a week, two weeks before. No, he got out. So he breaks that rule. And then here comes Hillary
[53:59.380 --> 54:05.700]  saying, get it all out. Get it all out. Now, here's what they've got going for them. They've
[54:05.700 --> 54:10.420]  got the Republicans saying, get it all out. They've got Trump saying, get it all out. And of course,
[54:10.420 --> 54:16.980]  you've got Hillary saying, get it all out with the intended purpose being the emails that Comey
[54:16.980 --> 54:24.580]  is going to release. Those emails have already been purged, Alex. And there's nothing in it
[54:24.580 --> 54:31.220]  to incriminate Hillary or Obama. Meanwhile, no one looks at the new WikiLeaks coming out daily,
[54:31.220 --> 54:35.460]  or the total coup de gras that came out last week with Obama and Hillary saying,
[54:35.460 --> 54:41.540]  we've got to clean this up and cover it up. And the campaign already has the press releases
[54:41.540 --> 54:48.020]  ready to go in as far as I know. The mainstream media already have the papers already ready.
[54:48.020 --> 54:54.740]  The front page is ready to print saying that Hillary was innocent all along. This whole email
[54:54.740 --> 55:04.420]  thing was a Republican fraud set out to confuse the American people. It was never real. She walks
[55:04.420 --> 55:10.260]  away with the election. That's the plan. Now, the problem they're having, Alex, internally,
[55:10.260 --> 55:19.060]  the FBI guys have gained forces and they've got a few surprises for Comey and Hillary.
[55:19.060 --> 55:22.340]  But the best thing I can say to Donald Trump, if he would listen to me,
[55:23.220 --> 55:28.100]  I don't want you to come out on behalf of me or you, Alex, anybody else and just disavow
[55:28.100 --> 55:34.180]  what Comey's trying to do. But it would be wise for him to say, Donald Trump should say,
[55:34.180 --> 55:38.980]  you know, colleague guys, you know, Alex is kind of weird, Hillary calling for these after
[55:38.980 --> 55:43.940]  she spent two years sledgehammering computers and washing them with this acid thing.
[55:44.500 --> 55:50.820]  Why now does Hillary want this stuff to come out pretending as if she doesn't know what's
[55:50.820 --> 55:56.260]  on these computers? Hillary has known everything that everybody's known since day one. You know
[55:56.260 --> 56:00.580]  that, Alex. I agree, Larry. Let me throw this in then. We needed to let people know that we
[56:00.580 --> 56:05.140]  haven't gotten to the big enchilada. I had been told this. Clearly, George Soros and the Ford
[56:05.140 --> 56:11.300]  Foundation have spent a billion bucks stirring up black Americans to riot and burst them down.
[56:11.300 --> 56:16.980]  The false flag coming up is a contested election. You've got that from high level sources.
[56:16.980 --> 56:20.660]  I've gotten that as well. They've gotten the National Guard ready. They're canceling school
[56:20.660 --> 56:24.900]  on November 8th. That was Friday. They are really gearing up for something big and you talk to
[56:25.620 --> 56:32.100]  a super high level as it gets and they concurred. So, so that everybody knows, Alex, I have told
[56:32.100 --> 56:36.820]  you who I've talked to and you're perfectly capable of calling him if you'd like if he'll
[56:36.820 --> 56:41.220]  talk to you. But I don't hide who I've talked to. I just cannot put his name out for obvious
[56:41.220 --> 56:44.740]  judiciary. Well, I mean, I've had this very person as a very high level source through a
[56:44.740 --> 56:48.420]  super high level source as well. So, I know it's a very good patriot that's aware of what's
[56:48.420 --> 56:53.780]  happening. I've already confirmed your source. The thing that he said to me was he was worried
[56:53.780 --> 57:01.700]  and he said, Nick, the ground's starting to rumble and it's a rumble that will be heard
[57:01.700 --> 57:08.260]  all the way to the other side of the earth. And I said, what are you talking about? And he said,
[57:08.260 --> 57:13.300]  it's triggering. He said, you know, you've been talking and I didn't believe you in the beginning
[57:13.300 --> 57:18.980]  when you talked about a velvet coup and all that silent coup stuff. He said, Nick, I believe you
[57:18.980 --> 57:25.540]  now. It's here. You see, they tried, Alex, to set it up. They tried to trigger this coup
[57:25.540 --> 57:32.260]  with Black Lives Matter, with riots. They tried to trigger this coup with Islamic
[57:32.820 --> 57:40.980]  blowing stuff up. They kept on and kept on. Stay there. Stay there. We're back in 70 seconds.
[57:40.980 --> 57:42.900]  Second hour folks. We're going to cover this exclusively.
[57:42.900 --> 57:48.020]  It only eight days to the critical election. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:48.020 --> 57:56.100]  You ever wonder what happened to America? Because of what we did on this day,
[57:56.100 --> 58:00.180]  change has come to America. Something's wrong and we all know it.
[58:00.180 --> 58:05.780]  I'm Charlie Daniels and I'm here to tell you about it. The nation has been hijacked by international
[58:05.780 --> 58:13.460]  forces, bent on global governance. When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage,
[58:13.460 --> 58:20.500]  mom and apple pie. God was in school, morality had a future, and beef was for supper.
[58:21.300 --> 58:27.620]  Revelation, dawn of global government. We're the solution. Americans ain't nothing more to it than
[58:27.620 --> 58:33.860]  that. Starring Alex Jones, Charlie Daniels, and Special Ops General Jerry Boykin, theatrical

[59:49.060 --> 01:00:18.740]  We are on the March. The Empire is on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN
[01:00:19.140 --> 01:00:26.260]  Radio Network. So it's a desperate move. Tommy knows he covered up crime. He's
[01:00:26.820 --> 01:00:29.700]  going to be destroyed, discredited, his agency turning against him.
[01:00:30.580 --> 01:00:34.820]  The crimes have gone so far. What do they do? They bring up a side issue, a bunch of emails.
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:38.900]  There's probably some meat and potatoes there. But it becomes a whole distraction from WikiLeaks
[01:00:38.900 --> 01:00:42.660]  that already connects the president and Hillary to lying to Congress, the public, you name it.
[01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:49.620]  Calling black people dumb. I mean, the stuff this week has come out is head spinning crazy.
[01:00:49.620 --> 01:00:55.300]  I can't believe how bad these folks are. Even if you're bad, why do you write emails like you're
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:01:00.740]  a villain? I mean, it's crazy. Larry Nichols is with us in this short segment and one other
[01:01:00.740 --> 01:01:07.460]  former Clinton insider helped basically run the governor's mansion there in Arkansas until
[01:01:07.460 --> 01:01:10.900]  they became so criminal he wouldn't go along with it. So you were talking to this high-level
[01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:16.100]  person. They were saying the triggering's here. Black lives didn't matter. That whole thing didn't
[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:21.140]  get the war going. It didn't cause a whole collapse. It didn't cause a civil war. What's coming next?
[01:01:27.060 --> 01:01:33.620]  We lose him? All right. I'm here. I'm here. I'm sorry. Okay. It's okay. Larry, please continue.
[01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:37.620]  Well, the plan is that when they steal this election,
[01:01:37.620 --> 01:01:44.020]  why is I steal it out in the open? They want to make sure, Alex, that all of us know they just
[01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:51.940]  outright stole it. And when they win by stealing it, they expect an uprising from all of us that
[01:01:51.940 --> 01:01:59.460]  claim foul. And that's going to be the triggering mechanism to totally shut down our former government.
[01:02:00.340 --> 01:02:07.060]  They're going to claim that it's impossible to lead America in the present condition it's in
[01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:11.940]  with the division that's here. So therefore they're going to have to enact forceful rules,
[01:02:11.940 --> 01:02:17.060]  you know, the rest. Alex, they're planning. Now, this is not just, this ain't coming from me.
[01:02:17.060 --> 01:02:22.340]  This is coming from people in high positions that are scared. They've been looking for the
[01:02:22.340 --> 01:02:29.460]  triggering mechanism. Now it's here. But the first thing we have to do is we have to stay focused.
[01:02:29.460 --> 01:02:35.060]  I'm sorry. I can't read very well. You have to stay focused. Watch for Wiki links. That's where
[01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:43.380]  the real egg is that you want to find. And watch, do not drop the ball on voter fraud. You can stop
[01:02:43.380 --> 01:02:50.500]  voter fraud by exposing it. You can. You can stop voter fraud. There was a lady, Alex, that called me.
[01:02:50.500 --> 01:02:54.420]  She and her husband were going to the doctor. The doctor's office was under remodeling. So she
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:02:58.340]  went to a strip center where their temporary office was. They went in the wrong office. There
[01:02:58.340 --> 01:03:02.500]  were all these desks, you know, a big room full of desks and all these young people.
[01:03:02.500 --> 01:03:06.740]  They said, what's going on anyway? They found out that's the wrong place. They went next door.
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:11.300]  Her husband went outside and there were a couple of young men smoking cigarettes that were in that
[01:03:11.300 --> 01:03:17.140]  office. He didn't ask them. He said, good Lord, what have they got going on in there? The two guys
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:25.060]  told them we're going through the obituaries and casting votes. You know how? Didn't even care
[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:30.500]  that they knew. Well, that's just like, that's just like the project Veritas was the national
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:34.180]  director and his adjunct just go, we're going to steal everything and we don't care if the
[01:03:34.180 --> 01:03:39.940]  journalists know. That's right. In Pennsylvania, you've already got reports there in Philadelphia
[01:03:40.500 --> 01:03:48.580]  of precincts that have already had 120%, 140% of the registered voters in those precincts have
[01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:57.620]  already voted absentee. Impossible. Already. So this is what's happening. And folks, I'm,
[01:03:57.620 --> 01:04:02.660]  you know, Alex, please tell folks, man, I'm sitting here hard to breathe, can't breathe.
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:08.420]  I'm not here sensationalizing anything. I'm not, I'm not here to do anything. I'm passing on what I
[01:04:08.420 --> 01:04:14.820]  know. That's all I can do. Well, my problem got one more segment with you and I'm going to talk
[01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:20.820]  about this when we come back. It's just a 60 second break. I want to recap the martial law scenario,
[01:04:20.820 --> 01:04:28.180]  but it's incredible. Your source basically through another one of my high level sources said the
[01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:32.180]  exact same thing a while back. And I have these other sources that are saying the same thing that
[01:04:32.180 --> 01:04:36.900]  are mid level and have some other high level but not as high level as yours. And that the thing is
[01:04:36.900 --> 01:04:40.980]  they're getting the military ready. Everybody the good news is, like you said, the FBI is rebelling.
[01:04:41.540 --> 01:04:45.860]  The special forces are rebelling. The generals are rebelling because what they're being told is so
[01:04:45.860 --> 01:04:51.220]  nakedly criminal. And you and so many others, the listeners have exposed the criminality of the
[01:04:51.220 --> 01:04:56.820]  Clinton machine. They even mainstream news calls them a crime family, even the Chicago Tribune
[01:04:56.820 --> 01:05:26.660]  says she should step down. So he's about to try to execute a coup naked.
[01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:32.020]  Donald Trump all day like rabbit hounds, rigged polls being broadcast daily to provide the fake
[01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:36.260]  optics that Hillary Clinton is actually winning and to discourage people from voting Trump.
[01:05:36.260 --> 01:05:40.740]  Fake celebrities endorsing Clinton across all platforms. So with all this, what are we doing
[01:05:40.740 --> 01:05:45.220]  to keep this election from being stolen? What can we do to prevent election fraud? I propose that
[01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:49.460]  all Donald Trump supporters wear red on election day. On November 8th, when you head to the polls
[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:54.020]  to vote Donald Trump, be decked out in red. This way, just as we dominated in rally turnout,
[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:57.780]  we can prove and provide the optics that we also dominated in voter turnout.
[01:05:57.780 --> 01:06:09.940]  Wear red on election day and make America great again.
[01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:19.460]  It's Sunday, October 30th, 2016. We are now only eight days out from the most important
[01:06:19.460 --> 01:06:24.740]  election in modern world history. Your listening to our show, show, show.
[01:06:26.180 --> 01:06:30.020]  That's right, eight days till the election, nine days until we begin to discover what's
[01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:34.100]  going to happen. Larry Nichols is behind the Clinton Chronicles. I've been interviewing him
[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:39.540]  for over 20 years. He's the guy that said they will not indict her. Come, he works for her.
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:43.780]  You will watch the whole media said, Oh, no, he's great. He will or he'll call for the indictment.
[01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:48.900]  He was right. And I have called all my different high level sources. I've called seven or eight
[01:06:48.900 --> 01:06:53.540]  people and they didn't. Some of them didn't know I'm not a lot on Friday. They just knew the word
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:58.900]  was Hillary was already going to get indicted over the new stuff that came out on WikiLeaks
[01:06:58.900 --> 01:07:04.420]  that proved she'd lied. So they said, what wiener? And then they basically started saying exactly
[01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:09.540]  what Nichols is saying that that's a diversion from what's already come out. And then Hillary
[01:07:09.540 --> 01:07:13.700]  can sit there in grandstand and say, I want that released. I want that released because she knows
[01:07:13.700 --> 01:07:16.660]  that's not the smoking gun. But man, when you look at the Wall Street Journal, it's up on
[01:07:16.660 --> 01:07:22.100]  info wars.com drudgerport.com. You name it. They're talking about 650,000 different emails
[01:07:22.980 --> 01:07:29.700]  that are in this data dump. So even they released that, how do you go through all of that? Meanwhile,
[01:07:31.220 --> 01:07:35.620]  Democrats should ask Clinton to step aside from the editorial board of the Chicago Tribune.
[01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:38.100]  We've already seen all these big papers attack Trump for no reason.
[01:07:39.220 --> 01:07:42.580]  But when you start seeing the Chicago Tribune come out against her,
[01:07:42.580 --> 01:07:47.540]  Loretta Lynch, pleading the fifth to Congress in all these different investigations, that's the
[01:07:47.540 --> 01:07:53.220]  attorney general. Roger Stone's coming up in the next segment. He says the Globals are
[01:07:53.220 --> 01:07:59.060]  deserting Hillary from his intel, even in fake polls where they're sampling nine,
[01:07:59.060 --> 01:08:06.900]  12, 15% more Democrats. Hillary is now two to five points on these Gallup polls, ABC polls,
[01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:11.700]  you name it behind. But you just heard Larry Nichols and it's all over mainstream news,
[01:08:11.700 --> 01:08:15.460]  ABC, CBS, NBC. To local news is credit. They're actually reporting on it.
[01:08:16.020 --> 01:08:22.100]  Dead people voting, illegals voting. Bloomberg came out and said, oh, cities are letting illegals
[01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:27.140]  vote. It's a good thing on Friday. But Trump's crazy, illegals aren't voting. I'm like, what is
[01:08:27.140 --> 01:08:32.420]  the story like that? Larry, why would Bloomberg have a story on Friday saying illegals are voting,
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:36.980]  but Trump's still wrong about it? I mean, and, you know, it's not a big deal to have illegals vote.
[01:08:36.980 --> 01:08:41.700]  I actually said that. Let's let them vote. What is that where they admit something, but then say
[01:08:41.700 --> 01:08:46.900]  we're wrong? It's weird psychological warfare. I mean, I know you were a green beret and, you
[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:50.260]  know, a bunch of secretive operations. That's why you got a sign of the Clintons and their
[01:08:50.260 --> 01:08:56.900]  old CIA operation as fake governors. But what is this next level stuff? You know, Alex, it's all
[01:08:56.900 --> 01:09:02.660]  just the part of confusing and trying to get those people that are out there that might be
[01:09:02.660 --> 01:09:07.620]  sitting somewhere on the fence that are daily bounced from one side to the other. That's right.
[01:09:07.620 --> 01:09:11.620]  It's nonsense on purpose. That's what all the big names told me. It's not meant to make sense.
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:16.500]  It's meant to go. What the hell? Exactly. It's supposed to make it a balking effect. It's just
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:21.380]  like when the picture balks in the game. That's what it's for. And let me say this to everybody
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:26.980]  that might doubt what you and I are saying. And Alex didn't do this. I did. But folks, I named names.
[01:09:26.980 --> 01:09:33.620]  You know, I named Comey. I named Lynch. They consume me criminally for the things I've just
[01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:38.420]  said about them. If I can't prove it, the court of law. So let's get serious about this. You
[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:41.860]  know, Alex, I've told you for what we've talked about for almost a year now,
[01:09:42.420 --> 01:09:46.420]  but I have said this is the last election we're going to have.
[01:09:47.540 --> 01:09:52.580]  I've never acted so criminal. They've never pulled out stops. They've never geared up for
[01:09:52.580 --> 01:09:58.340]  Marshall all the way they are. No. I mean, everyone in this audience and everybody should
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:03.380]  be able to see everywhere, but they don't. You should see, they're going to extremes
[01:10:03.380 --> 01:10:09.380]  never before even dreamt of, but they're going to them now. In part, it's because of what you
[01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:13.300]  just said. This is war. Hillary doesn't care if it comes out. She's a criminal. She wants to become
[01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:19.220]  a dictator in a climate so dangerous, the elite have to make her dictator to keep them in place.
[01:10:19.220 --> 01:10:23.380]  And remember, she can do anything she wants in her mind. Her and Bill, she can do anything she
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:28.980]  wants. Because why? Number one, she knows she'll not be prosecuted by by Lynch or Covey. She knows
[01:10:28.980 --> 01:10:33.460]  she'll not be exposed by the media. She knows that they know that they've got three ways.
[01:10:33.460 --> 01:10:37.780]  So is there any point you talk about curveballs, the decent people in the government are ready to
[01:10:37.780 --> 01:10:42.580]  throw? You said this last week it's now happening. I mean, how do we fight back against this?
[01:10:42.580 --> 01:10:48.820]  Just exactly what I said last week. You go and you protect your vote. When you go into a voting
[01:10:48.820 --> 01:10:55.060]  machine, if it's touchscreen, do not leave that voting booth until somebody in that precinct
[01:10:55.060 --> 01:11:00.900]  have proved to you that your vote was logged exactly like you cast it. And if they cannot,
[01:11:00.900 --> 01:11:06.340]  you demand a paper ballot. You demand a paper ballot. And then all of your veterans groups get
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:13.380]  together, go to the inner city precincts of these major cities, certainly the ones in the major
[01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:19.380]  states, the states that are the whatever you call them for the electoral stuff, get to those states,
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:25.700]  have people in those precincts, and you'll catch them coming up in vans. You'll catch them going
[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:33.060]  in and out voting over and over and over. Take a picture of it. Notify, do this very seriously.
[01:11:33.060 --> 01:11:37.620]  Don't get in their way. Don't cause a confrontation. But when you get pictures of it,
[01:11:37.620 --> 01:11:43.140]  go in and notify the head of the precinct. Tell them that you've seen that. Then you leave there,
[01:11:43.140 --> 01:11:49.140]  you call the police immediately, and you have a police report. Then police report. Then you go
[01:11:49.140 --> 01:11:54.980]  to Alex Jones to your side, Alex, or anywhere else they can go, and you log it on any of these sites
[01:11:54.980 --> 01:12:01.140]  that provide you a place to log where you've witnessed voter fraud. It's going to come down to
[01:12:01.140 --> 01:12:07.700]  that. And I know you say, Alex, well, if we do that, that really won't stop. Listen, these people
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:13.940]  going and casting these votes are committing a crime, and they know it. And if they think they're
[01:12:13.940 --> 01:12:20.100]  being watched, Alex, they'll move on. They won't vote. How do I know? Because I did it. I know.
[01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:29.300]  I know what they'll do. I know. You can win this thing. Trump is winning, but you cannot let them
[01:12:29.300 --> 01:12:34.660]  convince you. You cannot let them get you sidetracked. They're masters at misdirection.
[01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:38.980]  Oh, that's why they're saying it's intimidation to even do exit polls is legal and lawful.
[01:12:38.980 --> 01:12:43.140]  They're really scared of what you and Roger Stone have talked about. They are really scared of
[01:12:43.140 --> 01:12:47.060]  knowing our numbers are out there because we document enough of it. And we have 100 cases
[01:12:47.060 --> 01:12:51.060]  on video. We already have five or six. It'll absolutely discredit them no matter what they do.
[01:12:51.060 --> 01:12:55.860]  So the full war is happening now. They are full court press with everything they've got.
[01:12:55.860 --> 01:13:04.660]  They are hammering 110 percent and Comey bottom line is is hedging his bet in case Trump gets in
[01:13:04.660 --> 01:13:09.620]  that at least he reopened investigation. Hillary green lighted that because it diverts off of the
[01:13:09.620 --> 01:13:14.180]  WikiLeaks and all the rest of stuff that's happening. They think the FBI is dumb. The people
[01:13:14.180 --> 01:13:17.860]  that are good guys in there and good people in there. And so they'll think, oh, we've reopened
[01:13:17.860 --> 01:13:21.780]  it. But the good news is from you, they're all seeing right through it. They're seeing through
[01:13:21.780 --> 01:13:26.420]  it. And they're growing. I was told they were growing in numbers every day. Comey's not going
[01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:32.580]  to have enough people crooked in the FBI by the time this eight days is over to suit up a basketball
[01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:39.540]  team to suit up a basketball team. I'm telling you, it's there. We can do it. You know, Alex,
[01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:47.620]  I'm sorry I'm sick, but I'm doing the best I can. But please, folks have got to help. They've
[01:13:47.620 --> 01:13:54.500]  got to help us. We've got to stop them stealing this election or there will not be another one.
[01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:59.060]  That's right. They're totally going for broke. And I would just add here that the mainstream media
[01:13:59.060 --> 01:14:03.780]  is the most shameful group in all this, how they have willfully engaged in a criminal,
[01:14:03.780 --> 01:14:08.580]  organized, racketeering conspiracy against our republic. I'm not an addictive person. But here's
[01:14:08.580 --> 01:14:12.900]  the thing. We get Trump in the battle begins. He must immediately through the Constitution
[01:14:12.900 --> 01:14:18.100]  Bill of Rights, route out these mafias, or they're always going to be trying to bring him down.
[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:23.620]  Trump cannot make a deal with them and then have them back off. We have to deal with them and remove
[01:14:23.620 --> 01:14:28.260]  them. Now, there's one other thing we got to talk about very. But you agree with me. We do have to
[01:14:28.260 --> 01:14:34.420]  remove them, don't we? You bet. And he can and we'll talk about that after we win. But I hear a lot
[01:14:34.420 --> 01:14:39.300]  of people talking about the electoral college. Look, don't worry about that. I know the electoral
[01:14:39.300 --> 01:14:44.100]  college agree, but don't worry about that. Let's get through the general vote. When we get through
[01:14:44.100 --> 01:14:49.220]  that and Trump wins, Alex, I promise you will come on this program. If I'm still here, welcome on
[01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:54.980]  this program. And we'll tell people exactly how to stop them stealing the electoral college. Do
[01:14:54.980 --> 01:15:02.420]  not worry about that at this time. Worry about this election. That's what you focus on. And Alex,
[01:15:02.420 --> 01:15:06.020]  if people can help, please give me that paper. I need that. That's right. Let me talk about this.
[01:15:06.020 --> 01:15:10.100]  Larry is in the hospital today. I was there making hospital calls in the background. So even the
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:13.540]  hospital, he said, yeah, I'm there. He said everything you can to get the word out. We
[01:15:13.540 --> 01:15:18.020]  need to keep this guy alive as long as possible. Get the word out. We need to put up his PayPal
[01:15:18.020 --> 01:15:24.100]  address on screen. Give that for radio listeners. It's Nichols live. One word. Nichols live at
[01:15:24.100 --> 01:15:28.900]  AOL.com. Thanks for reminding me because I told you I wanted to plug that for your medical bills
[01:15:28.900 --> 01:15:31.940]  and try to help you out. Larry, you're such a jewel. Better hang on about 10 more years,
[01:15:31.940 --> 01:15:38.980]  everybody. Nichols live at AOL.com or send him a check or whatever to Larry Nichols 58 Kingsings
[01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:44.900]  Drive Conway, Arkansas, 72034. Larry will talk to you again a lot this week. Get out of the
[01:15:44.900 --> 01:15:50.100]  hospital and we appreciate you. You bet, buddy. Thank you. That guy has been so dead on. He kept
[01:15:50.100 --> 01:15:54.340]  saying she will not be indicted. She will not be indicted. I talked to some of my other sources
[01:15:54.340 --> 01:15:58.340]  and they're talking to Nichols as well. We'll be back with Roger Stone with Big Breaking News. Stay with us.

[01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:36.500]  completely built from the ground up. We've seen example after example of cable news networks
[01:18:36.500 --> 01:18:40.740]  attempting to deceive you. In short, the mainstream media is being covertly manipulated by well-financed
[01:18:40.740 --> 01:18:45.140]  political forces who are trying to sway public opinion in a natural direction that only serves
[01:18:45.140 --> 01:18:50.500]  establishment agendas. But Info Wars Live is the solution to the controlled press that is rapidly
[01:18:50.500 --> 01:18:56.660]  losing influence. So download Info Wars Live today at infowars.com and learn what's really going on
[01:18:56.660 --> 01:19:02.820]  instead of being spoon fed lies by the mainstream media. I'm Alex Jones with a simple question.
[01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:07.620]  Will you and your family be financially protected if there's another economic meltdown? Like many
[01:19:07.620 --> 01:19:12.660]  experts, I believe another devastating crash is coming. I think it's a matter of when, not if.
[01:19:12.660 --> 01:19:16.660]  Don't wait for another crisis that could wipe out your hard-earned money. Do what I did and call
[01:19:16.660 --> 01:19:23.540]  United States Gold Vault at 844-541-ALAX. It's a company I trust. They're offering Gold and
[01:19:23.540 --> 01:19:28.500]  Silver coin survival packs that could help safeguard your money in an economic meltdown.
[01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:33.380]  I'm talking real money, not paper or worthless stocks. China recently bought more than a billion
[01:19:33.380 --> 01:19:38.980]  dollars worth of gold, proving that gold is on the move. Gold and silver are recognized worldwide
[01:19:38.980 --> 01:19:45.140]  as one of the most stable means of protecting finances. Don't delay. Call 844-541-ALAX now
[01:19:45.140 --> 01:19:49.780]  and get a rugged, double-locked bank bag to securely store your coins, absolutely free.
[01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:55.220]  These are dangerous times and you need to make financial protection a priority. I personally
[01:19:55.220 --> 01:20:15.620]  owe me survival packs and you should too. Pick up the phone and call 844-541-ALAX now.
[01:20:25.220 --> 01:20:40.180]  All right, for the balance of this hour, Roger Stone joins us, former head of the Trump campaign.
[01:20:40.180 --> 01:20:45.540]  Now, I knew this, he's known this, just to prove how accurate we are so folks understand how dead
[01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:50.180]  on target we are, not for ego, but so people understand that we're key generals in the fight
[01:20:50.180 --> 01:20:55.060]  against the tyrants so we can actually defeat these people. I've always pointed out
[01:20:55.060 --> 01:21:01.540]  media matters for at least the last eight years under Obama literally directs MSNBC and CNN.
[01:21:01.540 --> 01:21:06.660]  It's the fence between the Winehouse and the Clinton camp as well and the mainstream media.
[01:21:06.660 --> 01:21:11.380]  Now, in WikiLeaks we learned the last few years, they've gone directly to commanding the media.
[01:21:12.180 --> 01:21:17.380]  But David Brock, I mean, I'll see it there and then a day later, it's word for word in the
[01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:22.900]  teleprompters everywhere. You know, Alex Jones wants to kill police. Alex Jones is a racist.
[01:21:22.900 --> 01:21:29.460]  Alex Jones is an anti-Semi, all made up garbage. It comes from them. We now have the WikiLeaks
[01:21:30.020 --> 01:21:35.220]  where they're specifically bragging about stopping Roger Stone saying, you know what,
[01:21:36.660 --> 01:21:41.860]  you know, for Nixon or whether it was Reagan or whether it was James Baker in the Bushes,
[01:21:41.860 --> 01:21:46.420]  you know, he's the guy trying to stop us. We've got to stop him. That's in the new
[01:21:46.420 --> 01:21:50.340]  WikiLeaks. I'm going to show on TV here in a minute images of it. So it's not
[01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:55.380]  Gonzo journalism where we make ourselves the news. We're in the news and I'm attacked by
[01:21:55.380 --> 01:22:02.020]  these people every day. Sometimes more than Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity combined. I mean,
[01:22:02.020 --> 01:22:05.860]  it's crazy, you know, the White House and Hillary and all these people are pissed at us.
[01:22:06.420 --> 01:22:12.180]  But knowing why they're mad at us is how we win the war. So first, Project Veritas now got the
[01:22:12.180 --> 01:22:18.020]  video of what's in the emails with the head of media matters admitting that, oh, we got,
[01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:21.460]  that's Kramer, the guy that admits they're rigging the election nationwide, you know,
[01:22:21.460 --> 01:22:27.940]  getting people to vote of his adjunct over and over again, bragging about how they shut down
[01:22:27.940 --> 01:22:32.660]  Roger Stone on CNN, all these other channels. This is incredible. Now, it just came out today.
[01:22:32.660 --> 01:22:36.900]  It's got 140,000 views. It'll get 10 million views. Stop on infowords.com. But we're not here
[01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:42.340]  talking about Roger for Roger's sake. He probably wants to get another stuff. But it just illustrates,
[01:22:42.340 --> 01:22:47.140]  we don't script these interviews, it illustrates where we're going. So I want to get into his
[01:22:47.140 --> 01:22:52.660]  sources on what's happening with these latest emails, where Comey's going, is he hedging his
[01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:56.820]  bets? Is it a distraction from WikiLeaks? Like Limbaugh saying, and my sources say Limbaugh's
[01:22:56.820 --> 01:23:00.900]  right. Friday, I was like, well, my sources are saying she's going to jail. They called back and
[01:23:00.900 --> 01:23:05.140]  they go, no, no, no, you're not listening. They were already planning to have to indict her because
[01:23:05.140 --> 01:23:10.180]  of the new WikiLeaks with Obama. It's total proof of covering up. We don't know what's in this. So
[01:23:10.180 --> 01:23:15.220]  it's quite a swamp that Donald Trump is trying to drain. This is an epic time to be alive.
[01:23:15.220 --> 01:23:21.780]  Where do you want to start, Roger? It's almost impossible to know where to start.
[01:23:21.780 --> 01:23:28.500]  This is an extraordinary election in which you have developments that I think are really seismic
[01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:35.780]  virtually every day. And it's hard to understand how the FBI director,
[01:23:36.420 --> 01:23:41.860]  who I believe technically reports to the attorney general, could not reopen this
[01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:46.820]  investigation without the approval of the president of the United States.
[01:23:46.820 --> 01:23:51.940]  Yet today, there are reports that the White House was blindsided and the attorney general
[01:23:51.940 --> 01:23:58.420]  was blindsided. I find that hard to believe. Well, that's your website, baseball. I mean,
[01:23:58.420 --> 01:24:05.620]  I was just in your briefing that I saw you put on your site, thestokeculture.com. You're saying
[01:24:06.180 --> 01:24:10.820]  that the elite are deserting Hillary and this is Obama getting ready to flusher.
[01:24:10.820 --> 01:24:17.540]  Well, and perhaps offer her a pardon on the way out. It means too late to remove her name
[01:24:17.540 --> 01:24:23.300]  from the ballots. Too many state ballots are printed. Too many states have already begun
[01:24:23.300 --> 01:24:32.340]  their early voting. One estimate is that perhaps as high as 30% of the people overall have already
[01:24:32.340 --> 01:24:38.980]  voted. She could conceivably limp through this election, although I think the late momentum
[01:24:38.980 --> 01:24:47.220]  is very definitely with Donald Trump. This event, Comey and making this announcement,
[01:24:47.860 --> 01:24:54.580]  has very clearly knocked the air out of the Clinton campaign. They are now attacking Comey,
[01:24:54.580 --> 01:25:01.140]  a guy they were praising only weeks ago for his judgment and his independence. I think there's
[01:25:01.140 --> 01:25:09.540]  more afoot here and I think there is an internal, internecine, democratic, party struggle. I'm
[01:25:09.540 --> 01:25:13.300]  seeing fratricide and I agree with the body language, claiming the plane didn't have Wi-Fi.
[01:25:13.300 --> 01:25:17.220]  When it says on the door, a Crip with Wi-Fi, they're real proud of that. She looked like she'd
[01:25:17.220 --> 01:25:22.740]  been punched in the stomach, showed her little water bearer, her, you know, Minion Abedin.
[01:25:22.740 --> 01:25:26.900]  The whole media wouldn't even cover her first press conference or her first speech saying,
[01:25:26.900 --> 01:25:31.220]  we don't know what she's saying, so we don't know she's been brief, so we're not going to show you.
[01:25:31.220 --> 01:25:36.420]  They seem to be in true panic mode. Yeah, it appears that way. Here's the irony, of course,
[01:25:36.420 --> 01:25:43.380]  that Donald Trump from the beginning has said that the Huma Abedin-Wiener connection was problematic
[01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:50.500]  and he was concerned about anything that Huma may have told her husband that was either classified
[01:25:50.500 --> 01:25:59.300]  or top secret. How pathetic to believe that something in the Abedin-Wiener emails that could
[01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:07.220]  now potentially bring her down. Well, so, so Roger, talking to your sources and also just in your,
[01:26:07.220 --> 01:26:13.060]  you know, great gravitas in politics, to me, at just a seismic level, it feels like victory. A
[01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:18.020]  great piece came over me. He doesn't want to have to reverse himself. This is him hedging his beds,
[01:26:18.020 --> 01:26:23.140]  knowing Trump is surging. No matter how they try to spin it, even if these emails are a distraction
[01:26:23.140 --> 01:26:28.980]  from WikiLeaks, it seems like the great fork of doom is being stuck into Hillary and she's done.
[01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:35.940]  Well, the problem with the idea that this is a distraction from WikiLeaks, that assumes that
[01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:42.100]  the WikiLeaks' disclosures have been getting the kind of coverage that they merit. They haven't.
[01:26:42.100 --> 01:26:48.820]  They've gotten good coverage, but many in the mainstream media have continued to block the
[01:26:48.820 --> 01:26:53.460]  WikiLeaks' disclosures. Oh, yeah, they've cherry-picked. They've gone to the weak sections of it.
[01:26:54.340 --> 01:27:00.660]  I think that's accurate. On the other hand, I feel what you feel. I was at a Trump rally in
[01:27:00.660 --> 01:27:06.260]  Washington, D.C. yesterday. I ran into the great Joe Big, so I barely recognized that he trimmed
[01:27:06.260 --> 01:27:14.020]  his beard. But you could feel the electricity in the air. You could feel the momentum shifting
[01:27:14.020 --> 01:27:22.420]  to Trump. And then this morning, John Podesta was on CNN with Jake Tapper, again,
[01:27:22.420 --> 01:27:28.500]  attacking me by name three times. Again. Why are they so obsessed with you? Because he's had a lot
[01:27:28.500 --> 01:27:32.260]  of campaign managers. I mean, you guys have been friends for 40 years. The email show,
[01:27:32.260 --> 01:27:36.740]  they are obsessed with you. And we're not talking about you for ego. That's important. Why are the
[01:27:36.740 --> 01:27:42.740]  head people for Hillary obsessed with you? Perhaps it is because I am effective. I mean,
[01:27:42.740 --> 01:27:48.900]  this isn't about this election. It's not about Roger Stone. It is not about, you know, me in any
[01:27:48.900 --> 01:27:56.740]  regard. The attacks on the messenger are meant to distract from the message itself. It isn't
[01:27:56.740 --> 01:28:04.180]  who leaked the WikiLeaks material. That's as important as the substance of the emails,
[01:28:04.180 --> 01:28:11.220]  which no one credibly has yet refuted, refuted as not genuine or authentic.
[01:28:11.220 --> 01:28:15.940]  Sure. We're going to come back and play some of this, you know, top Clinton operative,
[01:28:15.940 --> 01:28:20.820]  talking about how they got you banned. But first we come back here in just about a three-minute break.
[01:28:22.500 --> 01:28:26.260]  Why is Hillary haranguing him? As you pointed out, she was praising him two weeks ago.
[01:28:26.260 --> 01:28:31.620]  Why is Podesta haranguing Comey when he is totally covered their butt? That seems like a really bad
[01:28:31.620 --> 01:28:37.460]  move. Well, it's because the fix was in. The problem is the guy they thought they had bought
[01:28:37.460 --> 01:28:42.420]  didn't stay bought, as they say. And we now know his wife has come out and said, what are you doing
[01:28:42.420 --> 01:28:47.140]  to Comey? Everybody hates us. And the agents are now, I was told by high level source. I'm going
[01:28:47.140 --> 01:28:50.260]  to ask you this if you've heard of this. We haven't talked in three or four days off air.
[01:28:50.260 --> 01:28:57.780]  The FBI is getting ready for a press conference with as much as 30 or 40 senior agents. And when
[01:28:57.780 --> 01:29:01.060]  they heard 30 or 40, we're going to do it hundreds more ready to go.
[01:29:01.060 --> 01:29:04.260]  Farms has been fuchs here, host of the Bright Side. And as many of you know,
[01:29:04.260 --> 01:29:09.220]  I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy. You've all heard the shocking statistics
[01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:13.460]  despite spending trillions of dollars in health care, nearly $10,000 per man,
[01:29:13.460 --> 01:29:17.540]  woman and child in this country. Obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and auto
[01:29:17.540 --> 01:29:21.940]  immune illnesses are rampant. One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health
[01:29:21.940 --> 01:29:26.580]  challenge and everyone knows at least one person with a degenerative disease. If you're dealing
[01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:30.020]  with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain your vigor and longevity,
[01:29:30.020 --> 01:29:34.260]  and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate nutritional raw materials into

[01:32:02.020 --> 01:32:06.740]  defense for us. It took you over a year to do it. Why is this so good? Because people are actually
[01:32:06.740 --> 01:32:12.500]  waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most. I mean, I try to make sure that I
[01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:17.940]  don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in my system, but right now we're dealing with
[01:32:17.940 --> 01:32:23.940]  massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[01:32:23.940 --> 01:32:29.300]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[01:32:29.300 --> 01:32:33.060]  going on everywhere. These are all parasites. Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so
[01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:37.700]  many things that are in it. You have the neem in there. You have the organic clove bud, the organic
[01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:42.580]  wormwood. I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year. All right, well, I'm glad
[01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:45.940]  we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today. It just came back in yesterday.

[01:33:25.940 --> 01:33:50.660]  We've got two segments left, and I'll be back tomorrow, Lord willing. 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.,
[01:33:50.660 --> 01:33:56.020]  central 12 noon to 4 p.m. Eastern. Roger Stone, StoneColdTruth.com is our guest, former head of
[01:33:56.020 --> 01:34:01.860]  the Trump campaign, one of the main fighters out there is a WikiLeaks show that they're most afraid
[01:34:01.860 --> 01:34:06.820]  of. That's why we love having him on because his info is still on target. We have a Chicago Tribune,
[01:34:06.820 --> 01:34:13.700]  big supporters of Hillary, St. Democrat should ask Hillary to step aside because the contestant
[01:34:13.700 --> 01:34:17.780]  election, the corruption, all the baggage they've been caught lying in WikiLeaks,
[01:34:17.780 --> 01:34:23.220]  she's going to get removed from office. Well, Hillary doesn't care she's going forward.
[01:34:24.420 --> 01:34:30.340]  Roger Stone, globalist, deserting Hillary. Hillary has too much baggage for globalists,
[01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:36.580]  says Stone. I've really psychoanalyzed this. Tell me if I'm wrong, Roger. Comey was in
[01:34:36.580 --> 01:34:42.020]  trouble with his wife. The FBI is in mutiny. They're moving towards press conferences.
[01:34:42.020 --> 01:34:48.980]  That's the intel I got coming up this week. More WikiLeaks. He wants to save his legacy. He goes
[01:34:48.980 --> 01:34:55.300]  with this. Whether it's meat potatoes or not, the other FBI folks are saying, oh, it's a diversion
[01:34:55.300 --> 01:34:59.220]  because they're sick of Comey. They're ready to put his head politically on a stick.
[01:35:00.420 --> 01:35:08.660]  And so there's almost like a fervor of the villagers trying to storm Frankenstein's castle.
[01:35:08.660 --> 01:35:13.780]  Is that accurate? Well, it may be. I mean, this is kind of like criminology. We've got to try to
[01:35:13.780 --> 01:35:21.380]  figure out what's happening on, but an alternative narrative would be that Comey put this to bed
[01:35:21.380 --> 01:35:27.140]  for the Clintons just as he put the Sandy Berger affair away for them when he was at the Justice
[01:35:27.140 --> 01:35:32.980]  Department, just as he put the Mark Rich Parton scandal away from them. No one indicted and either
[01:35:32.980 --> 01:35:39.860]  one of those scandals, no one charged, despite the egregious violation of law. And the uprising at
[01:35:39.860 --> 01:35:47.300]  the FBI has no doubt caught his attention. And then into his lab drops new information that
[01:35:47.300 --> 01:35:56.340]  make his previous position unsustainable. So he makes this announcement. I suspect I would have
[01:35:56.340 --> 01:36:03.060]  thought that the veteran agents that the FBI would have been pleased with the fact that he's
[01:36:03.060 --> 01:36:10.500]  finally taken a position that seems to conform with the facts. So I'm not sure any of us can tell
[01:36:10.500 --> 01:36:16.420]  exactly what has happened. It's still having spent almost 40 years in Washington. It's spent some
[01:36:16.420 --> 01:36:22.340]  time in government and the entire time in politics. It's hard for me to believe that the FBI director
[01:36:22.340 --> 01:36:29.140]  makes a an announcement of this import without the approval of his boss, the president of the
[01:36:29.140 --> 01:36:35.540]  United States. I just find that very hard to believe. Now, the Clintons feigned outrage
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:42.100]  that he's taken this position, but they didn't have much outrage when Bill met with the U.S.
[01:36:42.100 --> 01:36:47.860]  Attorney General completely inappropriately days before this decision was announced.
[01:36:47.860 --> 01:36:51.940]  They're saying it's inappropriate for him to tell Congress, but then their meeting secretly
[01:36:51.940 --> 01:36:56.260]  on an airplane getting caught. Looking at this and Roger Stone. Yes.
[01:36:57.940 --> 01:37:03.220]  Isn't it really just that come he does want to cover his butt and that the Clintons are upset
[01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:12.260]  about this? Well, that's probably what it is, but it does in a race this close with an electorate
[01:37:12.260 --> 01:37:18.660]  this volatile. It does have the potential to change the race. Now, I argued on here yesterday
[01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:23.700]  that the momentum had already shifted to Trump. There was evidence that he was coming on.
[01:37:24.580 --> 01:37:31.460]  This, I think, continues to be true. If anything, this announcement accelerates that trend.
[01:37:32.180 --> 01:37:39.380]  New poll in Florida today, Trump up four. As I said yesterday in Pennsylvania, where I
[01:37:40.420 --> 01:37:48.100]  mentioned David Urban, the hard driving, very well organized and shrewd organizer heading
[01:37:48.100 --> 01:37:55.700]  the Trump campaign in the Keystone State. In Florida, Susan Wiles, one of the most accomplished
[01:37:55.700 --> 01:38:02.900]  and experienced political operators not only in the state, but nationally, heads the Trump campaign,
[01:38:02.900 --> 01:38:08.820]  knows what she's doing, is supremely well organized, probably needs more resources,
[01:38:08.820 --> 01:38:16.180]  but I have enormous confidence in Susan Wiles. Again, a standout in the Trump campaign in terms
[01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:24.020]  of knowing what she's doing. Although they are in a catch up mode, the Trump campaign will never be
[01:38:24.020 --> 01:38:30.420]  the well oiled machine that the Clintons have, but they'll more than make up for it in enthusiasm
[01:38:30.420 --> 01:38:36.580]  and intensity. Unlike several days ago, I'm feeling better and better about Florida.
[01:38:37.140 --> 01:38:44.260]  I wish that the campaign would spend some money on Spanish language media highlighting Trump's
[01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:50.580]  economic program and what it would mean to the Hispanic community. But all of that said,
[01:38:50.580 --> 01:38:56.580]  I think Trump is on track to carry a state that Alex he must carry to win this race.
[01:38:57.860 --> 01:39:04.340]  So where would you put the race right now? It's still a toss up, but momentum is what's important
[01:39:04.340 --> 01:39:08.980]  because the race is going to be in a different place tomorrow than it was today and then it was
[01:39:08.980 --> 01:39:15.460]  yesterday. That's how volatile and close this is. Sure. We're now eight days and a few hours out from
[01:39:15.460 --> 01:39:21.140]  this. Other wildcards are the Clintons out of ammo. What else could happen? Well, one thing I do want
[01:39:21.140 --> 01:39:26.500]  to clarify because there's been a lot of comment on it. And I am interested in being accurate. And
[01:39:26.500 --> 01:39:33.060]  I think you would admit that everything I have predicted or said since we met and I began doing
[01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:40.100]  these broadcasts has turned out to be true. Yesterday, I said that I had intelligence that
[01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:46.740]  Hillary Clinton had met with the Broward County supervisor of elections and that that wasn't
[01:39:46.740 --> 01:39:53.620]  on her schedule. There was no media presence. And I believe that there was video and photos
[01:39:53.620 --> 01:40:03.140]  existing. I was incorrect about that. In fact, I was off by a county. The Clinton entourage pulled up
[01:40:03.140 --> 01:40:11.300]  behind the West Palm Beach office of the Palm Beach County supervisor of elections. Hillary
[01:40:11.300 --> 01:40:17.460]  Clinton was physically seen by at least three witnesses meeting with officials from the building.
[01:40:17.460 --> 01:40:24.500]  These observers were shooed away. I am trying to determine whether there is
[01:40:24.500 --> 01:40:31.060]  existing video. I'm told that there is. So I want to clarify our information came from a
[01:40:31.060 --> 01:40:38.020]  very well-intentioned woman to women really who are active in Citizens for Trump. There was some
[01:40:38.020 --> 01:40:43.860]  language barrier because they are Spanish speakers. I do not speak Spanish. The information came
[01:40:43.860 --> 01:40:50.740]  through a Citizens for Trump official and I was incorrect. I have now clarified it
[01:40:51.460 --> 01:40:58.740]  other than to say Palm Beach is of course ground zero of the Democrats book stealing operation.
[01:40:59.300 --> 01:41:04.180]  More on this tomorrow. We're going to bring in a few minutes of the final segment. I want to
[01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:10.020]  come back and actually play the latest project Veritas video where they have this, you know,
[01:41:10.020 --> 01:41:15.060]  top Clinton operative admitting that they're trying to ban you from television and were successful.
[01:41:15.060 --> 01:41:20.100]  But the minute or two we have left before you go to break other wildcards, other angles.
[01:41:20.660 --> 01:41:24.420]  I mean, it's talking to my sources, some of which are very high level. They say, well,
[01:41:24.420 --> 01:41:29.140]  they're already canceling school on November 8th. There's this big gear up for civil unrest.
[01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:36.500]  What do you expect to happen if Hillary does lose? Well, first of all, as you know, voting has
[01:41:36.500 --> 01:41:43.860]  started across the country early voting in a number of states and the volume of irregularities
[01:41:43.860 --> 01:41:49.140]  already is deeply concerned today. What do you call the level historic? I've never seen
[01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:55.220]  anything like this. I call it hysterical. I mean, the Huffington Post today attacking the
[01:41:55.220 --> 01:42:01.540]  stop the steel project insisting again, we seek to intimidate people that this is about
[01:42:01.540 --> 01:42:08.580]  dogs roving bands of dogs and tating voters. This is irresponsible. Sure. I'm saying the level of
[01:42:08.580 --> 01:42:13.140]  admitted vote flipping and fraud and dead people voting mainstream news admits it. I've never seen
[01:42:13.140 --> 01:42:18.740]  any admission this big. Then they go, Oh, it's insane. Trump's insane. Roger Stone's insane.
[01:42:18.740 --> 01:42:23.940]  Alex Jones is insane. There's zero fraud when Drudge has like 30 links today to mainstream news
[01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:28.340]  admitting it. Yeah, it's extraordinary. People voting twice, people voting in other people's
[01:42:28.340 --> 01:42:34.260]  names. No, I think it is. It is the precursor to what is going to happen. You're going to see
[01:42:35.140 --> 01:42:40.580]  massive voter fraud, but you're also going to see, in my opinion, machine manipulation.
[01:42:40.580 --> 01:42:43.620]  That's the big one. Let's talk about that straight ahead and also the try to control
[01:42:43.620 --> 01:42:46.980]  the media, which WikiLeaks totally shows. And my final point I want to ask them,
[01:42:47.780 --> 01:42:51.140]  look, even if she steals it or gets in, I mean, all the corruption that's come out,
[01:42:51.140 --> 01:42:56.340]  there's got to be no way she could stay in, even if they have the control of the courts,
[01:42:56.340 --> 01:43:00.340]  the control of the Justice Department. Just in public opinion, she is convicted.
[01:43:00.340 --> 01:43:04.420]  There was a mighty nation blessed above all of creation.
[01:43:04.420 --> 01:43:09.140]  Charlie Daniels. He's always loved America. He's always defended the Second Amendment.
[01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:13.780]  Let me, let me just read a little thing here from agenda 21. The American system of justice must
[01:43:13.780 --> 01:43:18.980]  be changed to conform to the rest of the world. Individual rights will have to take a back seat
[01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:22.340]  to the collective. Well, you know what the next move is going to be, don't you? It's going to
[01:43:22.340 --> 01:43:28.100]  become a few good. Oh yeah. I tell you, it ain't gonna sit well down my way at all. It ain't gonna
[01:43:28.100 --> 01:43:32.500]  sit well. Do you ever wonder what happened to America? It's time to ride, boys. We need a
[01:43:32.500 --> 01:43:38.180]  thousand Paul Revere's. When I was a boy, it was okay to be proud of the flag, heritage,
[01:43:38.180 --> 01:43:45.780]  mom and apple pie, and beef was for supper. Revelation, dawn of global government, theatrical

[01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:09.540]  Dew joins us. You worked, I guess, like 20 plus hours. Tell us what Brain Force did. I've been
[01:44:09.540 --> 01:44:15.140]  working all day. I took a couple hours off coaching basketball. I get in here at 8 30. I was kind of
[01:44:15.140 --> 01:44:18.820]  run down. You know, I just didn't feel like I was going to make it. And I really wanted to do a good
[01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:23.220]  job on the interview. I got my bottle of Brain Force right there. I popped two of them. And about
[01:44:23.220 --> 01:44:28.420]  20 minutes later, it's like, everything just kind of clears up. It's got four and a half stars.
[01:44:28.420 --> 01:44:33.460]  People really love it. Read about it. Find out why third-party nutraceutical sites give it such
[01:44:33.460 --> 01:44:39.300]  high praise because it really does have the best organic based systems that will blow your socks
[01:44:39.300 --> 01:44:42.660]  off. I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done it
[01:44:42.660 --> 01:44:47.940]  without Brain Force. I went home about 6 45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took
[01:44:47.940 --> 01:44:53.380]  two more Brain Force and came in. You will find Brain Force and other game changing products

[01:47:18.820 --> 01:47:23.140]  You want to stop charity? So does every other red blood of you.
[01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:30.580]  Oh, yeah. It's not on the tip of the spear.
[01:47:30.580 --> 01:47:38.900]  You want to stop charity? Well, so does he. Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:47:38.900 --> 01:47:42.100]  Hey, I'm not bashing other talk show hosts. They got to do what they got to do, talk radio,
[01:47:42.100 --> 01:47:45.700]  the rest of the media is collapsing. We're in a depression. Thanks to the globalists,
[01:47:45.700 --> 01:47:49.380]  they admit that's their plan. But other talk shows plug every segment because that's where
[01:47:49.380 --> 01:47:54.180]  the real ads are happening now is during the actual segment. But hey, you got to plug Alex,
[01:47:54.180 --> 01:47:59.620]  we got to pay the bills. And I'm, you know what, tune into the show tomorrow 11 to 3 p.m. Central
[01:48:01.380 --> 01:48:06.260]  12 noon to 4 p.m. Eastern. Tell folks about the articles of videos. We've got articles up where
[01:48:06.260 --> 01:48:11.140]  the LA Times says we don't know all these kids are getting paralyzed. They admit it's the vaccines.
[01:48:12.340 --> 01:48:17.780]  The insert says it can cause it. Really, for me, it's the public service announcement against
[01:48:17.780 --> 01:48:23.460]  collectivism and against tyranny. That's my payday. That's why I skip breaks and don't plug
[01:48:23.460 --> 01:48:27.620]  because I really don't care. I'm a free market guy, but there'll be no free market if we don't
[01:48:27.620 --> 01:48:36.500]  beat these people. So I've got a successful family. I've got a lot of opportunities. I never used my
[01:48:36.500 --> 01:48:40.820]  family for those opportunities. I'm on man. That's why I see these collectivists that want to live
[01:48:40.820 --> 01:48:46.740]  through some big giant state. I've never even used my family and their success to be successful.
[01:48:46.740 --> 01:48:50.180]  I've got my own stuff going on that's going to be bigger than anything they ever did. That's how
[01:48:50.180 --> 01:48:55.380]  this works. And I am sick and tired of watching all the dumbass collectivists that don't know how
[01:48:55.380 --> 01:48:59.780]  to build a country shit here and piss on what made this country great. This country isn't perfect,
[01:48:59.780 --> 01:49:05.540]  but compared to other nations, it's amazing. This is a referendum against cronies and insiders
[01:49:05.540 --> 01:49:12.740]  and cabals and mafias and every American that bleeds red blood and people all over the world know
[01:49:12.740 --> 01:49:16.900]  Donald Trump stands for that. It's an exciting time to be alive. Now, I want to get to this clip
[01:49:16.900 --> 01:49:22.900]  from latest project Veritas video that's on stone cold truth.com info wars.com. Of course,
[01:49:22.900 --> 01:49:28.820]  project Veritas is set site because it goes to the way they're trying to shut down our information,
[01:49:28.820 --> 01:49:33.140]  not because we're discrediting. If we were discrediting, they want us on there because it's
[01:49:33.140 --> 01:49:40.260]  scary to them. They know we know the truth. But what else do we do in the next eight days, Roger,
[01:49:40.260 --> 01:49:45.700]  to make sure the crime syndicate because even mainstream news is calling Hillary a crime family.
[01:49:45.700 --> 01:49:50.820]  What do we do to make sure this crime family is fully discredited because once we get them out,
[01:49:50.820 --> 01:49:55.860]  the door is so open to change the world. That's why they're so scared. Well, Alex,
[01:49:55.860 --> 01:50:02.420]  I've got to keep going back to election day and implore those who believe in a fair and honest
[01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:09.380]  election, please go to stop the steel.org and sign up as a volunteer to work on election day.
[01:50:09.380 --> 01:50:16.900]  We're trying to cover 7000 specific precincts in the swing states. These are precincts that are not
[01:50:17.460 --> 01:50:23.860]  selected on the basis of racial makeup. They are based on reports of fraud in the past
[01:50:23.860 --> 01:50:31.540]  or one party government, one party controlling the entire electoral process. If this election is
[01:50:31.540 --> 01:50:39.700]  hijacked, it will not be appealable unless there is admissible proof. That is the purpose of running
[01:50:39.700 --> 01:50:46.900]  a completely neutral, scientifically based exit poll. We're only interested in this project and
[01:50:46.900 --> 01:50:55.940]  talking to people after they vote. So we need your elbow grease. We need your boots on the ground.
[01:50:55.940 --> 01:51:01.620]  We need your shoe leather to help us. We will train you. We will help you. We will assign you.
[01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:05.540]  And you've got over 2,200 right now, thousands more getting trained in the next eight days.
[01:51:05.540 --> 01:51:09.620]  And we're not in competition with each other, folks. Vote at infowars.com is where you send
[01:51:09.620 --> 01:51:15.060]  evidence of fraud, videos, articles, photos. We'll post it. We'll send it to other journalists.
[01:51:15.060 --> 01:51:18.180]  We're giving leads to other journalists. If we've got one person on at midnight,
[01:51:18.180 --> 01:51:22.260]  though overwhelmed, we just send it on to WorldNet Daily or Breitbart or Drudge. We just,
[01:51:22.260 --> 01:51:26.420]  we were all on the same team for the integrity of this republic. And by the way, we catch any
[01:51:26.420 --> 01:51:31.620]  fraud for Trump. We're going to report it. It's a default, folks. We just tell the truth. We're
[01:51:31.620 --> 01:51:35.780]  seed of our pants. We're not cold and calculating and all organized like Hillary.
[01:51:36.580 --> 01:51:42.340]  Alex, I think you raised a very good point. The stop the seal project has targeted a number
[01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:47.860]  of precincts in the state of Ohio where there is total and complete republican control.
[01:51:47.860 --> 01:51:52.820]  Because I want to make sure that the republican machine under the control of Governor John
[01:51:52.820 --> 01:51:56.020]  Casey. Oh, they're the ones that are going to say that exactly. They're the ones going after Trump.
[01:51:57.060 --> 01:52:01.220]  So this is not even partisan in the sense that we are going to be looking at
[01:52:01.220 --> 01:52:08.820]  selected republican precincts. This is the insiders versus the ultimate outsider, Donald J.
[01:52:08.820 --> 01:52:16.180]  Trump, a man I've known for 40 years, a man you cannot buy, you cannot bully, a man who believes
[01:52:16.180 --> 01:52:26.180]  in American exceptionalism, American autonomy, American supremacy, and American sovereignty.
[01:52:26.180 --> 01:52:29.700]  And the muleheadedness is his greatest attribute. That's why he can't be controlled.
[01:52:30.340 --> 01:52:36.900]  Well, you can't plug him into anything. He knows what he thinks. Perhaps. Just perhaps. If we could
[01:52:36.900 --> 01:52:43.540]  run government the way he's run his businesses, we wouldn't have the enormous economic problems
[01:52:43.540 --> 01:52:47.140]  that we have today. So he knows we're getting screwed over. And that's why they're so scared.
[01:52:47.140 --> 01:52:50.820]  I want to go to a few minutes, set up this clip. I know you've seen it. You didn't want to get
[01:52:50.820 --> 01:52:55.140]  into this. We're going to show it. I mean, let's sit here and show this clip because it gets into
[01:52:55.140 --> 01:52:59.460]  the inside control of the White House and the Clinton through media matters. Tell us what we're
[01:52:59.460 --> 01:53:06.420]  about to see. This is really extraordinary. James O'Keefe, a friend of mine of many years,
[01:53:06.420 --> 01:53:11.940]  who has really come into his own as one of the most significant players in this election, Alex,
[01:53:11.940 --> 01:53:19.060]  has taken, as you know, a series of videos that really pull the curtain back from the extraordinary
[01:53:19.060 --> 01:53:24.260]  corruption and fraud that surrounds Hillary's election effort. We have him bragging they're
[01:53:24.260 --> 01:53:33.540]  going to seal the election. So set up this clip. So this is the Veritas cameras interviewing
[01:53:33.540 --> 01:53:40.660]  this fellow who is titularly the president of media matters, the number one flunky for David Brock.
[01:53:40.660 --> 01:53:49.620]  And he can't help but boast how they have taken the MVPs, I'm flattered, for Trump off the boards
[01:53:49.620 --> 01:53:53.380]  as political spokesman. Because they run around either say we're horrible, some media doesn't
[01:53:53.380 --> 01:53:57.700]  have a son or they get his band acting like we're the failures, but really it's the info you're
[01:53:57.700 --> 01:54:01.380]  covering and I'm covering others are covering that's the most devastating and on target. Here it is.
[01:54:02.580 --> 01:54:07.380]  During our democracy partners investigation that Robert Kramer led us to media matters in
[01:54:07.380 --> 01:54:15.780]  Washington DC. This is media matters over there. Oh, cool. And wow, that's cool. Media matters calls
[01:54:15.780 --> 01:54:21.220]  itself a web based non for profit progressive research and information center. Media matters
[01:54:21.220 --> 01:54:26.340]  have been going after me for years. They've called me a hack, a liar, a convict. They're actually
[01:54:26.340 --> 01:54:31.620]  bankrolled by George Soros. They say they're pursuing truth, but then they brag about ruining
[01:54:31.620 --> 01:54:38.580]  people's careers. At the time, we did different sort of pressure point campaigns to get notable
[01:54:38.580 --> 01:54:44.180]  conservative voices off. So like Lou Dobbs and CNN left, now he's on Fox Business, Glenn Beck, Alpha
[01:54:44.180 --> 01:54:49.620]  Fox. Media matters president Bradley Baychock gave our journalist a tour of their offices.
[01:54:56.740 --> 01:55:01.140]  Baychock proudly boasted about the media matters assault on conservative writer
[01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:08.100]  and political consultant Roger Stone. So I think for Trump, our, our big role as a media watch dog
[01:55:08.100 --> 01:55:13.300]  has been to take his MVPs and put them on the sidelines. So the first one was Roger Stone.
[01:55:15.140 --> 01:55:21.780]  I didn't know that is in that case. So we led the campaign to, we tracked every book appearance
[01:55:21.780 --> 01:55:26.100]  that he did. We, we took everything that was crazy in his book and made sure that people
[01:55:26.100 --> 01:55:33.140]  knew that it was sourced even in crazy material. We, it parsed out his tweets by each ethnicity
[01:55:33.140 --> 01:55:38.980]  group or like attack that it was, whether it was on minorities or LGBT folks or immigrants.
[01:55:38.980 --> 01:55:42.740]  And we published that with each network. We reached out privately to the networks and said,
[01:55:42.740 --> 01:55:48.340]  Hey, are you aware, you have had this guy on four times in the last four months. And he said,
[01:55:48.340 --> 01:55:51.620]  these three things about all of these. And I know the White House is behind this.
[01:55:51.620 --> 01:55:59.540]  And ultimately we got him banned from Fox, from MSNBC, CNN, and he hadn't been on Fox
[01:55:59.540 --> 01:56:02.980]  in four months. So it's like, we try to take the MVPs off the sidelines.
[01:56:02.980 --> 01:56:06.740]  We thought it might be interesting to show the tape to Mr. Stone and get his reaction.
[01:56:06.740 --> 01:56:11.860]  Take MVPs off the sidelines. So Roger, what's your reaction to those comments from the media
[01:56:11.860 --> 01:56:17.620]  matters president? Censorship. See, when they can't refute what you have to say on any issue
[01:56:17.620 --> 01:56:25.700]  based basis, they resort to name calling, racist, bigot, fanatic, so on, deplorable.
[01:56:26.580 --> 01:56:32.980]  And then they, they try to high pressure the old media to destroy your, your media access.
[01:56:32.980 --> 01:56:38.660]  But we're out of time. The full video is on Project Veritas. It's on our site in fours.com
[01:56:38.660 --> 01:56:42.820]  and course stones. I'll play more tomorrow. But, but, but notice they were on, I guess that was
[01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:49.220]  Friday or Thursday together in DC. I didn't know why they were together. And I was saying,
[01:56:49.220 --> 01:56:53.140]  you guys are really most valuable players. I didn't know they were actually calling you that.
[01:56:53.140 --> 01:56:57.620]  I just saw this today for the first time, Hidden Cam, media matters, brags about sabotaging
[01:56:57.620 --> 01:57:03.460]  Roger Stone. It just shows how that they go after the most effective material, twist it,
[01:57:03.460 --> 01:57:07.860]  call it racist. You have nothing to do with race stuff. And it just shows what a joke these
[01:57:07.860 --> 01:57:12.100]  people are and how they're in control of the mainstream media, which, oh, you took Lou Dobbs
[01:57:12.100 --> 01:57:17.940]  off the only show with ratings. What geniuses, Roger? Yeah, it's really extraordinary yet
[01:57:17.940 --> 01:57:25.540]  the pattern continues. Alex, I am outraged that CNN would allow John protested to savage me this
[01:57:25.540 --> 01:57:31.860]  morning and not give me an opportunity to respond. Now, I've always had. We're out of time, Roger.
[01:57:31.860 --> 01:57:36.340]  You're coming back tomorrow at 1130, 30 minutes in. God bless you. You're awesome. Infowars.com.
[01:57:36.340 --> 01:57:39.940]  So much video up there breaking all this down. Bottom line, Hillary Clinton is burning down
[01:57:39.940 --> 01:57:44.420]  in front of everybody and they're trying to prop her up. It's not working. Eight days to the
[01:57:44.420 --> 01:58:10.420]  critical election. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
