[00:53.520 --> 00:56.680]  didn't know if she was gonna step down on the ticket four years ago and I was
[00:56.680 --> 00:59.840]  right there they drove by the Secret Service Hamer machine guns at us they
[00:59.840 --> 01:03.720]  were inside and I called the media and they said we don't report but we're not
[01:03.720 --> 01:09.040]  told to report because we're a bunch of scum so there you go that's their job
[01:09.040 --> 01:14.160]  folks you got to really get it's not a bias it's a military enemy propaganda
[01:14.160 --> 01:19.400]  arm there to keep you in the dark there to there to spin there to twist now the
[01:19.400 --> 01:23.160]  Obama administration is secretly preparing options for aiding Syrian
[01:23.160 --> 01:29.160]  opposition that's already going on again we've got reports with the Union
[01:29.160 --> 01:35.280]  leader publisher says Ron Paul is truly dangerous we've got Kraut hammer who's
[01:35.280 --> 01:39.920]  an embarrassing person coming out and talking about embarrassing candidates
[01:39.920 --> 01:44.920]  Ron Paul is embarrassing them he he's against all the corporate welfare he
[01:44.920 --> 01:48.600]  actually doesn't want to be he wants to keep the Constitution not have military
[01:48.600 --> 01:52.440]  on the streets although but like the New York Times and others say it's kooky that
[01:52.440 --> 01:55.360]  Ron Paul's worried about troops on the streets even as they set up checkpoints
[01:55.360 --> 01:59.320]  all over the country local dues papers are reporting others military
[01:59.320 --> 02:04.960]  checkpoints oh oh drones are tracking citizens now in North Dakota oh but it's
[02:04.960 --> 02:12.720]  still kooky it is and I don't think I can be explained by anything that the
[02:12.720 --> 02:21.480]  president has done in a positive way syndicated columns Kraut hammer I'm
[02:21.480 --> 02:28.080]  sorry I couldn't hear you oh wonderful hey governor Ventura I appreciate you
[02:28.080 --> 02:30.640]  calling in I know we talked yesterday and you said you'd popped in for 10
[02:30.640 --> 02:37.320]  minutes good to talk to you it's going great we're about to go to break and
[02:37.320 --> 02:40.200]  come back and I appreciate you giving us 10 minutes when I twisted your arm
[02:40.200 --> 02:43.840]  yesterday I know you weren't sure when you could call in but I wanted to get
[02:43.840 --> 02:46.680]  into Ron Paul with you since we were talking about him yesterday on the phone
[02:46.680 --> 02:51.040]  well why don't you go to break like you're supposed to and come back and we'll talk
[02:51.040 --> 02:56.040]  around Paul that's awesome we got a few minutes right now I mean let's go ahead
[02:56.040 --> 03:00.480]  and kick the ball off right now while the system is in panic mode over him
[03:00.480 --> 03:06.800]  absolutely and I'll tell you why he's the only candidate out there including
[03:06.800 --> 03:11.000]  president Obama who naturally is going to represent the Democrats of course and
[03:11.000 --> 03:17.000]  all of these Republican candidates he's the only candidate that is anti-war and
[03:17.000 --> 03:22.280]  this country better wake up to the fact that we've you know Alex I'm 60 years old
[03:22.280 --> 03:29.480]  now and we have been at war for over half of my life and they act like it's
[03:29.480 --> 03:36.360]  bizarre and behavior newt English says he's out of mainstream this guy's out of
[03:36.360 --> 03:43.480]  touch well if he is then we are a country of war but I don't believe so I believe
[03:43.480 --> 03:47.640]  there's an underlying unrest in this country right now that we're tired of
[03:47.640 --> 03:52.880]  war we're sick of it and I guarantee you pretty much if any of these other guys
[03:52.880 --> 03:59.160]  get elected you're gonna see a war with Iran oh you're right and and I want you
[03:59.160 --> 04:02.920]  to repeat all this recap and expand on it this is about the heart and soul of
[04:02.920 --> 04:07.920]  America another print of war lying and saying another country has nukes it's a
[04:07.920 --> 04:13.160]  total replay of what we saw with Iraq and Ron Paul is just talking total
[04:13.160 --> 04:17.320]  common sense and they're acting like that's bizarre kind of like somebody I
[04:17.320 --> 04:22.720]  guess in 1939 if you criticize Hitler I can't believe I watched the debate so
[04:22.720 --> 04:26.160]  it was interesting a couple weeks ago where he got into a battle with Mr.
[04:26.160 --> 04:33.240]  Bachman and Ron Pan made a great statement he said imagine where would we be
[04:33.240 --> 04:38.760]  today had John F. Kennedy not talked to Nikita Proust yes during the Cuban
[04:38.760 --> 04:43.360]  missile crisis by the way that was when Ron Pan was serving in the Navy and
[04:43.360 --> 04:50.720]  Ted does too not spoken during that crisis and work things out talking we
[04:50.720 --> 04:54.920]  probably would not exist today let's start over right there governor we've
[04:54.920 --> 04:58.160]  only got it for 10 minutes on the other side we really appreciate him joining us

[06:04.200 --> 06:11.760]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[06:11.760 --> 06:20.240]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas alex
[06:20.240 --> 06:25.880]  jones all right joining us for one segment he is governor Jesse Ventura
[06:25.880 --> 06:30.000]  he's getting ready to go down to Mexico so he's in a hurry but I was talking to
[06:30.000 --> 06:33.000]  him privately yesterday about what's happening in the world trying to find
[06:33.000 --> 06:38.080]  out if he's gonna be running for libertarian and he just wanted to talk
[06:38.080 --> 06:42.360]  about Ron Paul so he's here to talk about Ron Paul in this one segment than
[06:42.360 --> 06:46.960]  dr. Doug Rocky joins us former Minnesota governor host of the hit TV show on
[06:46.960 --> 06:52.360]  true TV conspiracy theory bestselling author Jesse Ventura joins us for one
[06:52.360 --> 06:59.680]  segment governor we have both parties hundreds of publications New York Times
[06:59.680 --> 07:05.120]  CBS Nightly News all attacking Ron Paul and saying he's nuts because he doesn't
[07:05.120 --> 07:10.000]  want to attack more countries with made-up WMD stories they're openly have
[07:10.000 --> 07:12.920]  gotten rid of posicom and taught us that are announcing secret arrest of
[07:12.920 --> 07:17.400]  citizens with the NDAA they're in the news saying it's insane that he doesn't
[07:17.400 --> 07:22.600]  want troops on the streets all of this is happening and it's like the twilight
[07:22.600 --> 07:28.160]  zone and Ron Paul is just a mainline old-fashioned American and then we've
[07:28.160 --> 07:33.520]  got the crazies telling us that we're crazy because we don't support total
[07:33.520 --> 07:35.520]  tyranny governor give us your breakdown on this
[08:04.160 --> 08:08.920]  so I think this will truly be an agenda for the United States of America
[08:08.920 --> 08:15.240]  an agenda determined to determine what we stand for do we stand for being the
[08:15.240 --> 08:20.400]  most aggressive war-mongering country in the world who's all set to now to go to
[08:20.400 --> 08:25.320]  where if I ran to where are we going to be a country that stands for peace you
[08:25.320 --> 08:30.320]  know let's remember the last president they wanted peace and was attempting to
[08:30.320 --> 08:34.040]  get it there would have been no Vietnam the code where would have been ended by
[08:34.040 --> 08:40.160]  65 was president John F Kennedy and there has not been a president in this
[08:40.160 --> 08:45.640]  country since Kennedy who has truly strived for peace but Ron Paul is that
[08:45.640 --> 08:51.480]  candidate and I think about it for a minute I'm 60 years old now I was born in 1951
[08:51.480 --> 09:00.080]  and this country has been at war over 30 years of those 60 years we've been at
[09:00.080 --> 09:04.840]  war and if you look at the other candidates Ron Paul served in the Navy
[09:04.840 --> 09:09.960]  during the Cuban Missile but you look at the other candidates did any of them
[09:09.960 --> 09:15.600]  ever serve did any of them ever put their butts on the line did they ever go in the
[09:15.600 --> 09:20.640]  military I don't think so you know I don't know for sure but I don't I you know
[09:20.640 --> 09:27.920]  I'd love to see the military backgrounds of Gingrich and the guy from Massachusetts
[09:27.920 --> 09:34.600]  Romney and you know right on down the line with one of them and the point of
[09:34.600 --> 09:40.560]  the matter is they call Ron Paul's foreign policy scary I call either foreign policy
[09:40.560 --> 09:46.240]  scary what it's on right now because all we do is go to where one after another
[09:46.240 --> 09:52.320]  after another and I'm one of the people being a veteran who says stop it well
[09:52.320 --> 09:55.720]  polls show that upwards of 70% of Americans are against all of this the
[09:55.720 --> 10:00.000]  troops give more money to Ron Paul that all of the Republican candidates
[10:00.000 --> 10:05.360]  combined and Obama combined and the media spends it and says Ron Paul just
[10:05.360 --> 10:11.320]  graces the troops the troops don't like Ron Paul it's all a hoax and more and
[10:11.320 --> 10:16.640]  more the so-called mainstream media is being exposed as a bunch of political
[10:16.640 --> 10:20.400]  prostitutes who are losing all their readers and viewers
[10:20.400 --> 10:25.560]  well it is the truth I mean if you look at how they avoid talking about Dr. Paul
[10:25.560 --> 10:31.280]  he can be leading in the polls and they don't do in-depth stories on him nothing
[10:31.280 --> 10:36.000]  like that the media is in the back pocket of the status quo and I can't
[10:36.000 --> 10:42.120]  emphasize more if people in this country want a revolution and a revolution
[10:42.120 --> 10:46.440]  doesn't have to be violent but if they want a revolution if they want a change
[10:46.440 --> 10:51.840]  in direction truly of where this country's headed then Ron Paul is the
[10:51.840 --> 10:56.120]  only choice out there right now out of the current candidates in the Republican
[10:56.120 --> 11:01.840]  and Democratic field he is the only only one he's the only one that says we
[11:01.840 --> 11:08.680]  ought to talk before we talk first or second we seem to be living if you
[11:08.680 --> 11:13.360]  don't do it our way well then our way would be we will rage where on you I
[11:13.360 --> 11:17.720]  mean look what they're doing in this little strip of ocean over there Iran
[11:17.720 --> 11:22.360]  threatening to block it off and the U.S. is already threatened if Iran does that
[11:22.360 --> 11:26.520]  we're going to go to war with them basically and look what's happening Iran
[11:26.520 --> 11:30.760]  who imports 50 plus percent of its gasoline they don't have the refine
[11:30.760 --> 11:34.120]  rays is it's been announced they're going to shut that off to them
[11:34.120 --> 11:38.440]  devastating them and they say okay have you shut us off we'll shut off our
[11:38.440 --> 11:43.720]  territorial waters so yesterday they sent a U.S. aircraft carrier through the
[11:43.720 --> 11:51.120]  giant Iranian drill as a provocation and the the Pentagon has said if you block
[11:51.120 --> 11:56.000]  it we will attack you but but the West as Ron Paul has said is already putting
[11:56.000 --> 12:00.200]  these sanctions on and blockades you're a Navy guy and Ron Paul pointed it out
[12:00.200 --> 12:03.680]  that is a act of war right there a blockade
[12:03.680 --> 12:09.000]  absolutely and what it does if people go back in history we did the same thing to
[12:09.000 --> 12:15.560]  Japan they blockaded Japan they stopped all you know a total blockade of the
[12:15.560 --> 12:20.480]  country Japan which first Japan truly to then attack us they were left with two
[12:20.480 --> 12:26.560]  choices surrender or attack Japan chose the latter they chose to attack us at
[12:26.560 --> 12:31.280]  Pearl Harbor but a lot of people forget we first their hand at Pearl Harbor by
[12:31.280 --> 12:36.400]  the blockade we had against them and the same old story with Iran now we're
[12:36.400 --> 12:40.600]  blockading them we're forcing their hand and they're to you know all of these
[12:40.600 --> 12:46.480]  candidates just wait and hope that Iran will do something that Iran will respond
[12:46.480 --> 12:51.960]  so that then we can all stand up there and see see we told you all the problems
[12:51.960 --> 12:58.080]  with Iran and now we're getting them meanwhile our government as you
[12:58.080 --> 13:01.920]  know is overthrown them at least two times evidence of a third as well
[13:01.920 --> 13:05.960]  shifting gears here because it's the top of drudge report right now Kelly
[13:05.960 --> 13:10.080]  Clarkson the American Idol winner which is about as big as it gets nowadays in
[13:10.080 --> 13:15.360]  America says she loves Ron Paul it's a big deal when prominent celebrities not
[13:15.360 --> 13:19.680]  just governors that's even more important endorse Ron Paul I haven't seen any
[13:19.680 --> 13:24.800]  news where they've been you know given your support to Ron Paul do you want to
[13:24.800 --> 13:51.680]  publicly state governor Ventura that you are endorsing Ron Paul
[13:54.800 --> 14:00.080]  it's not even close because I want a new president that's going to change the
[14:00.080 --> 14:03.800]  direction of this country I want a new president that's going to follow the
[14:03.800 --> 14:08.320]  Constitution I want a new president that's going to believe in states rights I
[14:08.320 --> 14:13.520]  want a new president I want somebody that will talk to status class yes and
[14:13.520 --> 14:18.480]  Ron Paul will do that then the only thing we have to worry about is keeping him
[14:18.480 --> 14:24.040]  alive what a dangerous precedent where both political party leadership say
[14:24.040 --> 14:28.560]  anybody who could ever potentially be a threat we've got to preemptively attack
[14:28.560 --> 14:33.400]  them that's what Hitler said he said I've got to attack France and and I've
[14:33.400 --> 14:37.680]  got to attack Poland and I've got to attack England and the Russians because
[14:37.680 --> 14:42.440]  they might attack us I mean that's what tyrants always say let me give this one
[14:42.440 --> 14:46.640]  out to you hypothetical hypothetical situation Alex for all you and your
[14:46.640 --> 14:52.720]  listeners let's say Hugo Chavez down in Venezuela who's got a lot of money and he
[14:52.720 --> 14:58.240]  fears the United States because of our military build up to all this and he fears that we could
[14:58.240 --> 15:03.640]  attack them at any moment because he took directs on well what if Hugo Chavez went
[15:03.640 --> 15:09.360]  and got one of these unmanned drones and what if Hugo Chavez flew that unmanned
[15:09.360 --> 15:14.240]  drone over United States airspace seeking to get intelligence about our
[15:14.240 --> 15:20.280]  war machine and what if that drone crashed in our country I would like to pose the
[15:20.280 --> 15:25.320]  question to every one of these Republican candidates and state this if you were the
[15:25.320 --> 15:30.200]  president what would you do if that happened and I'll bet you their response
[15:30.200 --> 15:35.360]  would sound very Iranian wouldn't it oh well they would probably actually say
[15:35.360 --> 15:39.920]  attack the country the Iranians agree I think that the United States of unmanned
[15:39.920 --> 15:52.600]  drones were using it for surveillance on us in fact here in our country just as we did in Iran we would declare war on whatever country that was
[16:01.240 --> 16:05.920]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is our
[16:05.920 --> 16:11.240]  last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that we're
[16:11.240 --> 16:16.000]  pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home I've turned members influence on
[16:16.000 --> 16:20.360]  our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think it's
[16:20.360 --> 16:25.600]  incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[16:25.600 --> 16:30.160]  Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel
[16:30.160 --> 16:34.560]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[16:34.560 --> 16:38.280]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[16:38.280 --> 16:42.240]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[16:42.240 --> 16:47.880]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the
[16:47.880 --> 16:53.480]  Republic yet your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at info wars dot com

[19:07.280 --> 19:10.880]  in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or

[19:14.240 --> 19:18.040]  country and it's possible that could even happen again so our friends at

[20:06.440 --> 20:14.520]  broadcasting network network we now take you live to the central Texas
[20:14.520 --> 20:18.880]  command center in the heart of the resistance you're listening to the
[20:18.880 --> 20:22.280]  Alex Jones show
[20:27.280 --> 20:32.400]  the entire architecture of the COG system is pointed at legitimate
[20:32.400 --> 20:37.800]  constitutional government the states the governors the general public you see
[20:37.800 --> 20:42.760]  drones being activated against rural communities in North Dakota for cows on
[20:42.760 --> 20:48.040]  their property you see state reps and governors calling for military to be on
[20:48.040 --> 20:55.840]  the streets of Illinois and Louisiana it's all happening right now because the
[20:55.840 --> 21:00.160]  world economy is preparing to implode it's all part of an organized program
[21:00.160 --> 21:03.840]  that we warned you about 12 13 years ago when they got rid of Glass-Steagall to
[21:03.840 --> 21:07.600]  sell derivatives to the planet get the planet to tie into that fraudulent debt
[21:07.600 --> 21:12.480]  and then implode the legitimate governments of this world and fold them
[21:12.480 --> 21:17.800]  into a private corporate banking cartel system that the technocrats and the
[21:17.800 --> 21:24.640]  kleptocrats call the New World Order now you'll know that two weeks ago we were
[21:24.640 --> 21:29.040]  sent by state employees documents that were public but but but no one had
[21:29.040 --> 21:33.360]  pointed them out with Kellogg Brown and Root who'd been given the contract
[21:33.360 --> 21:38.320]  according to Wall Street Journal in 2006 the contracts to build giant FEMA
[21:38.320 --> 21:44.880]  camps for emergencies across America then we got new documents a few weeks
[21:44.880 --> 21:50.000]  ago that they were now getting on 72-hour notice local teams ready of
[21:50.000 --> 21:55.840]  subcontractors to man them on a 72-hour notice or three-day notice then
[21:55.840 --> 22:00.760]  expanding from that point we received more documents that the Department of
[22:00.760 --> 22:07.240]  Defense was involved and that FEMA was basically orchestrating the entire
[22:07.240 --> 22:14.040]  operation then today a frequent caller who gets through on the radio Angie in
[22:14.040 --> 22:18.160]  the Carolinas called and I talked to her off-air and she said no you know my
[22:18.160 --> 22:22.320]  husband you know works for the Department of Defense you know that's why we
[22:22.320 --> 22:26.160]  keep pulling this stuff out to you this is on the official federal government
[22:26.160 --> 22:31.880]  websites for contractors and you need to understand it's it's got blue group
[22:31.880 --> 22:35.760]  designations I want wait I've been to urban warfare operations it's blue and
[22:35.760 --> 22:39.680]  red in Afghanistan it's blue and red now they were transponders he's like
[22:39.680 --> 22:44.320]  that's right here's the document I'm emailing it to you it's public and we
[22:44.320 --> 22:48.240]  went and pulled it up and sure enough I recognized everything in there from the
[22:48.240 --> 22:53.800]  drills I've been to first one was in 1999 and the Marines even let us in there
[22:53.800 --> 22:58.720]  in Oakland to their situation area in a big tent and had the red group fighting
[22:58.720 --> 23:02.760]  the blue group who were the militias and then I went in well they were doing
[23:02.760 --> 23:08.000]  interrogations of of actors who were playing the part of US citizens they
[23:08.000 --> 23:14.120]  would ask where'd you get the weapons and later the Marines freaked out that I
[23:14.120 --> 23:17.400]  was able to get this footage and we were threatened we were told well this was
[23:17.400 --> 23:21.440]  classified you shouldn't have seen it and it's in my film police state 2000 the
[23:21.440 --> 23:25.000]  sunshine project here in Texas got documents through four year where the
[23:25.000 --> 23:30.280]  Marines are training with drones and helicopters with pilots with with opiate
[23:30.280 --> 23:34.800]  knockout gases and plans to knock out whole cities during insurrection and
[23:34.800 --> 23:39.160]  you can pull this up the sunshine project was threatened and the government
[23:39.160 --> 23:43.080]  said you know remove that or we'll come after you it was accidentally
[23:43.080 --> 23:46.720]  declassified I mean this is the type of stuff I learned and I'm like we got to
[23:46.720 --> 23:52.320]  warn people now that said we went ahead and talk to Angie off here and then I
[23:52.320 --> 23:55.760]  talked to her husband and I was telling him sir you know we probably don't want
[23:55.760 --> 24:00.080]  to use your name because you work as a civil servant you know former Navy
[24:00.080 --> 24:05.720]  veteran in the Department of Defense in some pretty highly classified areas and
[24:05.720 --> 24:09.480]  he didn't get any of that with us and he said no I want to have my name public
[24:09.480 --> 24:14.280]  this country isn't so much trouble that this stuff's all public it's just you
[24:14.280 --> 24:18.440]  don't people don't know where to look that I'm gonna go ahead and use my full
[24:18.440 --> 24:23.320]  name and I'm gonna go ahead and speak out here because America is all on the
[24:23.320 --> 24:27.600]  line right now I mean this is really creepy stuff when they're openly passing
[24:27.600 --> 24:32.160]  the NDAA signal arrest US citizens was on the news today they're saying they'll
[24:32.160 --> 24:36.640]  kill US citizens if they want Obama says they'll kill US citizens in America in
[24:36.640 --> 24:40.680]  fact that was on C-span a few nights ago we've got that video it's overwhelming
[24:40.680 --> 24:44.400]  what's happening and now all over the news they're saying use the military on
[24:44.400 --> 24:49.360]  the streets to protect the American people they're selling us on this the
[24:49.360 --> 24:54.200]  TSA is now running checkpoints on highways this is classical martial law
[24:54.200 --> 24:58.800]  as Ron Paul said last Tuesday on my radio show the NDAA the National
[24:58.800 --> 25:04.400]  Defense Authorization Act is martial law so Joe Joseph works for the Department
[25:04.400 --> 25:09.240]  of Defense and some very highly classified areas and what space enable
[25:09.240 --> 25:12.920]  warfare but we'll leave it at that because that's all they can say and he
[25:12.920 --> 25:17.120]  basically wants to warn the public about what's open intelligence of what's
[25:17.120 --> 25:20.600]  happening and he also told me off air and he's gonna repeat it a lot of people
[25:20.600 --> 25:24.360]  the military and Defense Department are awake these are good people by and large
[25:24.360 --> 25:29.320]  that's why 70 plus percent of all donations to Republicans and to Obama
[25:29.320 --> 25:33.880]  in this race in the last order on Paul because they know Ron Paul's telling the
[25:33.880 --> 25:39.040]  truth they know they had a Bloomberg article two weeks ago headline pay this
[25:39.040 --> 25:43.480]  man money so he can fire you was the was the joke headline because he says
[25:43.480 --> 25:47.680]  he'll cut government the people in government realize you've got to get
[25:47.680 --> 25:51.160]  rid of this cancer they'd rather be homeless than let this tyranny go
[25:51.160 --> 25:56.560]  through so joining us is Joe Joseph Department of Defense civil servant to
[25:56.560 --> 26:01.040]  break down the national continuity program NCP program mission support
[26:01.040 --> 26:06.120]  activities which is unprecedented we have our article that is at info wars
[26:06.120 --> 26:11.840]  comm we just went up minutes ago going through all of this that I'll give you
[26:11.840 --> 26:17.840]  the title of right now it's military to designate US citizens as enemies
[26:17.840 --> 26:22.720]  daring collapse FEMA continuity of government plan prep total takeover of
[26:22.720 --> 26:27.780]  society dispatching military domestically under economic collapse
[26:27.780 --> 26:32.680]  emergency and that's what's so important we are designated the exact same way
[26:32.680 --> 26:38.120]  combatants in Afghanistan or Iraq are or Libya Joe Joseph again thank you for
[26:38.120 --> 26:42.680]  joining us over the phone I'm glad to be here Alex well I've talked enough at
[26:42.680 --> 26:46.520]  the start of the show and in your intro this is complex subject matter why are
[26:46.520 --> 26:51.880]  you going public what can you tell the people that's open source well as a
[26:51.880 --> 26:57.880]  civil servant you know you everybody takes a nose no matter what level of
[26:57.880 --> 27:02.840]  service that you provide to the country and it's the same oath that the president
[27:02.840 --> 27:09.000]  takes all the way down to active duty military and when you take that oath to
[27:09.000 --> 27:14.440]  support and defend the Constitution you're supposed to take it seriously I
[27:14.440 --> 27:19.800]  guess you could say so with that said it's my duty to provide the people who
[27:19.800 --> 27:26.120]  are my boss with information to make them aware because you know an informed
[27:26.120 --> 27:30.680]  public can really make a difference but they have to they have to do something
[27:30.680 --> 27:35.560]  can't sit on their hands and and just sit there and let this stuff happen and
[27:35.560 --> 27:40.040]  that's going on for far too long so hopefully by giving this information out
[27:40.040 --> 27:45.640]  we can raise some awareness and get people angry and that's really what
[27:45.640 --> 27:50.520]  needs to happen I mean people need to get angry we need to see civil disobedience
[27:50.520 --> 27:54.240]  you know you don't have to consent silence is consent in the eyes of the
[27:54.240 --> 27:58.240]  law and that's the biggest thing that people need to understand don't be
[27:58.240 --> 28:03.520]  silent anymore it's time to speak out you know you you brought up Ron Paul
[28:03.520 --> 28:11.000]  Ron Paul is probably the last best hope we have right now to turn things around
[28:11.000 --> 28:17.160]  he's it and that's why like you said active duty military is the largest
[28:17.160 --> 28:21.240]  contributor to his campaign out of all the other candidates combined he gets
[28:21.240 --> 28:26.880]  more than they do so it's very it's very important that we that we take the
[28:26.880 --> 28:33.640]  time now so that our children don't end up having I can't even imagine the
[28:33.640 --> 28:38.040]  world that they're gonna live in considering what we deal with now well
[28:38.040 --> 28:45.800]  it's a world Joe where Corzine can take a billion plus dollars and be caught in
[28:45.800 --> 28:52.240]  perjury and he isn't even gonna get in trouble absolutely
[29:00.280 --> 29:04.520]  you've heard Alex explain how the silver lungs generator infuses the

[34:43.800 --> 34:48.640]  documents yes Department of Defense gave out the contracts to prepare
[34:48.640 --> 34:54.120]  occupying the FEMA camps but this is the one that gets into the total takeover
[34:54.120 --> 35:00.320]  of government and it says COG the break-ins on media surveillance the
[35:00.320 --> 35:04.920]  you know the blue force go through this document with us it's a it's a
[35:04.920 --> 35:10.480]  fascinating document and first of all just so everybody understands this is
[35:10.480 --> 35:15.600]  all public information this is what's called a solicitation for contract and
[35:15.600 --> 35:22.680]  basically the government has a website fedbizops.gov where they put out draft
[35:22.680 --> 35:28.520]  statements of work and contractors will go and bid for the work it's a very
[35:28.520 --> 35:33.680]  convoluted hard to search through system which is why things are very easy to
[35:33.680 --> 35:38.280]  overlook you know case in point if you wanted to look up contracts you know you
[35:38.280 --> 35:41.280]  type in Department of Homeland Security you're going to see thousands of
[35:41.280 --> 35:45.920]  contracts that come up and you'd have to comb through each and every one of them
[35:45.920 --> 35:50.120]  to find it unless you know the key words and the key acronyms it's got 35
[35:50.120 --> 35:53.600]  agencies on there is probably hundreds of thousands of contracts absolutely I
[35:53.600 --> 35:58.520]  mean and like I said and that's just you know that's just that's what makes it
[35:58.520 --> 36:03.080]  so difficult so I can totally understand how you know it may have been missed or
[36:03.080 --> 36:08.520]  misinterpreted and it's very easy to do you know I just recently I saw a
[36:08.520 --> 36:15.840]  solicitation Department of Education wanting 500 military militarized shotguns
[36:15.840 --> 36:21.520]  really you know but this is all public information so expanding on that I've
[36:21.520 --> 36:28.760]  probably been to 20 urban warfare drills researched this for 14 years 13 years or
[36:28.760 --> 36:32.000]  so because I wasn't onto this the first few years on there and when I read these
[36:32.000 --> 36:36.840]  documents I understand some of it but it's all meant to be Greek it's all put
[36:36.840 --> 36:41.000]  in a military contractor parlance where the general public doesn't know what
[36:41.000 --> 36:46.840]  blue groups against red groups mean exactly right well let me let me go
[36:46.840 --> 36:52.560]  this I'm on page 3 of the document and this is there's only certain paragraphs
[36:52.560 --> 36:56.000]  that you really have to key in on to understand what it's all about and it
[36:56.000 --> 37:00.320]  says other efforts of the operations division and operations division is
[37:00.320 --> 37:06.040]  exactly that they oversee the operations of continuity of government they are the
[37:06.040 --> 37:11.280]  contractor support with government oversight so other efforts of the
[37:11.280 --> 37:15.640]  operations division includes initiatives such as operation rendezvous or
[37:15.640 --> 37:21.040]  operon task force rendezvous the development and integration of the
[37:21.040 --> 37:27.360]  federal emergency response official repository system national security
[37:27.360 --> 37:32.600]  special event contingency support disaster relief and human humanitarian
[37:32.600 --> 37:36.440]  assistance contingency support and then it says additional efforts of the
[37:36.440 --> 37:42.680]  operations division include geospatial information system which is like a
[37:42.680 --> 37:49.440]  tactical a battlefield information it gives a battlefield that's what I saw
[37:49.440 --> 37:53.600]  with the Marines with big projectors on the wall where they have the satellites
[37:53.600 --> 37:58.280]  real-time yes where they have the transponders as blue group the militias
[37:58.280 --> 38:02.680]  they were practicing fighting in California were red group right and I had they
[38:02.680 --> 38:06.960]  had Humvees with with robot guns that anybody not in blue group was going to
[38:06.960 --> 38:13.720]  be killed and this was 12 years ago well I mean it's it's it's advanced same
[38:13.720 --> 38:19.600]  concept but the technology has advanced somewhat you for situational awareness
[38:19.600 --> 38:26.360]  is what you're talking about and in that sense it's much like for years for
[38:26.360 --> 38:31.120]  example commercial aircraft have a transponder on it and that system is
[38:31.120 --> 38:35.960]  called interrogation friend or foe IFF that's what that stands for and
[38:35.960 --> 38:40.080]  basically blue force situational situational awareness is the exact
[38:40.080 --> 38:45.440]  same thing that you have with commercial aircraft military aircraft and
[38:45.440 --> 38:51.000]  everything else they have a transponder where a signal goes out the plane
[38:51.000 --> 38:55.040]  responds and then on the operator's screen you're gonna either have like a
[38:55.040 --> 39:00.240]  circle a square or a triangle and it's going to be either a circle for friendly
[39:00.240 --> 39:08.240]  it's going to be a square for unknown and a triangle for bad guy and and so
[39:08.240 --> 39:12.240]  that's that's what you have blue force situational awareness is exactly that
[39:12.240 --> 39:18.760]  so you because of today's technology I mean a transponder can be look at RFID
[39:18.760 --> 39:22.240]  well our cell phones have little triangulators so we know they've actually
[39:22.240 --> 39:26.120]  used those and so they've got a full battlefield scope they can tie into
[39:26.120 --> 39:31.560]  cameras on the street surveillance systems satellites drones any of it and
[39:31.560 --> 39:35.920]  so they know friend or foe and this is talking about in continuity of government
[39:35.920 --> 39:41.560]  with camps having people with their transponder badges in the blue group
[39:41.560 --> 39:46.120]  against the red group and the red group is the American people I guess right
[39:46.120 --> 39:50.280]  well this is the scary thing about when you talk when you talk blue force
[39:50.280 --> 39:53.400]  situational awareness the first thing that I think about when I think of that
[39:53.400 --> 39:59.960]  is overseas in Afghanistan and Iraq and Libya and wherever we're waging illegal
[39:59.960 --> 40:05.400]  wars that's where I envision blue force situational awareness what I don't
[40:05.400 --> 40:11.080]  envision is having blue force situational awareness on our own soil
[40:11.080 --> 40:18.600]  because it's almost too crazy to wrap your arms around it's just too much to
[40:18.600 --> 40:23.080]  to understand what Ron Paul said NDAA is a declaration of war against the
[40:23.080 --> 40:28.280]  American people it is it truly is and you know even if and here's the thing
[40:28.280 --> 40:32.880]  that people need to understand a lot of these representatives and senators of
[40:32.880 --> 40:36.720]  course they don't read the bills they don't do that same thing in government
[40:36.720 --> 40:42.000]  these draft statements of work nine times out of ten are written by the
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.280]  contractor submitted back to the government and the guy there you know
[40:46.280 --> 40:50.000]  he's just like yeah well yeah okay I'll just pass this on through okay fine put
[40:50.000 --> 40:54.480]  my signature on it now it goes so oftentimes they don't even know what's
[40:54.480 --> 40:58.600]  in there they just know that they get an overview okay this is there this is
[40:58.600 --> 41:01.600]  there this is there make sure that you guys hit this point this point in this
[41:01.600 --> 41:08.440]  point and then they ship it on through so if a company like Halliburton who we
[41:08.440 --> 41:14.240]  know has ties to this elitist cabal goes and writes a statement of work
[41:14.240 --> 41:18.000]  there's no telling what's in there and that's why it's important well I get it
[41:18.000 --> 41:22.560]  they're actually influencing policy by the way the contracts are written and
[41:22.560 --> 41:26.640]  the higher-ups don't even understand that right exactly right that's that's
[41:26.640 --> 41:30.280]  the thing that people don't understand is that part of the dumbing down of
[41:30.280 --> 41:35.640]  society it hasn't only affected the masses it's affected government as well
[41:35.640 --> 41:39.720]  a lot of these government employees now don't even know how to write a statement
[41:39.720 --> 41:43.960]  of work you know and and so well look I've been studying this particular type
[41:43.960 --> 41:49.160]  of thing for 13 14 years and I barely have a elementary understanding and I
[41:49.160 --> 41:53.480]  guess it's part of the complexity of the world allows corruption to hide in it
[41:53.480 --> 41:59.480]  absolutely and you know there's another on this is this is extremely
[41:59.480 --> 42:04.400]  interesting is on page five they they come out with Mount Weather Emergency
[42:04.400 --> 42:10.960]  Operations Center now I've been doing this for probably three or four years
[42:10.960 --> 42:15.640]  now and like I said before off air it's because of you that I woke up and
[42:15.640 --> 42:22.040]  listening to you one of the alternate government heads along with Colorado
[42:22.040 --> 42:27.240]  Springs and Cheyenne Mountain I mean they've made movies about martial law or
[42:27.240 --> 42:31.520]  Mount Weather runs it all well exactly right but for years and years they
[42:31.520 --> 42:36.760]  denied the existence of Mount Weather and now and when I say that I mean yes we
[42:36.760 --> 42:41.200]  know Mount Weather's there and they say yes it's a 564 acre Department of
[42:41.200 --> 42:44.880]  Homeland Security Facility but what people don't understand is yay look
[42:44.880 --> 42:49.560]  it's a deep underground military base it's one of those just like Cheyenne
[42:49.560 --> 42:52.680]  Mountain and everything else
[43:00.600 --> 43:05.040]  hi folks this is Alex Jones I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to

[45:01.960 --> 45:05.840]  should consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate
[45:05.840 --> 45:09.600]  legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two our
[45:09.600 --> 45:13.520]  new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows
[45:13.520 --> 45:17.920]  you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the name of
[45:17.920 --> 45:22.400]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[45:22.400 --> 45:27.120]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[45:27.120 --> 45:30.920]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[45:30.920 --> 45:34.560]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[45:34.560 --> 45:38.920]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[45:38.920 --> 45:42.080]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[45:42.080 --> 45:45.720]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[46:00.800 --> 46:04.560]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs
[46:04.560 --> 46:09.320]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[46:09.320 --> 46:13.240]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[46:13.240 --> 46:17.120]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[46:17.120 --> 46:22.040]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[46:22.040 --> 46:27.320]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[46:27.320 --> 46:31.920]  nano particles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[46:31.920 --> 46:36.160]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[46:36.160 --> 46:41.000]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow
[46:41.000 --> 46:45.520]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go
[46:45.520 --> 46:50.720]  to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough
[46:50.720 --> 46:57.520]  technology of the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[46:57.520 --> 47:06.520]  coast-to-coast direct from Austin you're listening to the Alex Jones
[47:06.520 --> 47:32.520]  Broadcasting Network
[47:36.520 --> 47:45.000]  so who are you you globalist crux who are you
[47:49.200 --> 47:57.760]  what if I say I'm not gonna surrender what if I say you're the pretender what
[47:57.760 --> 48:24.760]  if I say I am fired up you know that last caller was asking when do we get
[48:24.760 --> 48:31.200]  violent the first person to shoot loses we're not looking for a fight but I'll
[48:31.200 --> 48:36.680]  tell you my my ideology my worldview is not like Gandhi's it's a mix of George
[48:36.680 --> 48:42.160]  Washington and Mahatma Gandhi I understand the globalist want violence
[48:42.160 --> 48:46.240]  upfront and they want to characterize people who are against their tyranny as
[48:46.240 --> 48:50.040]  the criminals and as the disorder the globalist are criminals they are the
[48:50.040 --> 48:54.280]  disorder hiding behind their three-piece suits and behind their stolen
[48:54.280 --> 48:57.760]  billions and the military and police that they've tried to brainwash but the
[48:57.760 --> 49:01.800]  good news is the police and military are waking up and you know 10 years ago I
[49:01.800 --> 49:05.200]  wouldn't say in that I can go over all the evidence but I want to go to Gerald
[49:05.200 --> 49:12.280]  Salante the point is 70 plus percent of all donations for the military are to
[49:12.280 --> 49:16.680]  Ron Paul for both parties all presidential candidates police are
[49:16.680 --> 49:21.400]  supporting Ron Paul Bloomberg bemoaned it last month saying give this man your
[49:21.400 --> 49:24.800]  money so he can fire you and pointed out guess who gets the majority of federal
[49:24.800 --> 49:29.700]  employee donations Ron Paul that tells you the folks inside the federal
[49:29.700 --> 49:32.240]  government know what's going on they're sitting there watching what's
[49:32.240 --> 49:36.480]  happening they're just paymasters who pay the stolen money out to the mega
[49:36.480 --> 49:43.120]  corporations they know they know that gets easier to wake up military and
[49:43.120 --> 49:46.520]  police anybody else because they actually live in the real world they're
[49:46.520 --> 49:50.640]  seeing what we're talking about I can't tell you how many letters I get how many
[49:50.640 --> 49:54.480]  emails how many calls you've heard them or police officers say nothing made
[49:54.480 --> 49:58.120]  sense I've been on the force 20 years 10 years whatever the case is until I
[49:58.120 --> 50:01.240]  started listening and everything I'd always questioned didn't understand now
[50:01.240 --> 50:05.120]  it makes perfect sense you took me outside the compartmentalization you
[50:05.120 --> 50:12.760]  didn't show me how to see you pointed out what was already there you woke me up
[50:12.760 --> 50:16.640]  when you wake somebody up all you say get up you're not doing the work you're
[50:16.640 --> 50:21.840]  just get up you're up you're awake now you see you see the same thing I see you're
[50:21.840 --> 50:25.400]  not believing what Alex Jones is saying you're not buying into what I'm saying
[50:25.400 --> 50:32.720]  you're seeing you're seeing it all right Gerald Salente is just a great friend
[50:32.720 --> 50:36.240]  of the show and we really appreciate him coming on right here near the end of
[50:36.240 --> 50:43.960]  the year to give us his 12 trends first here for our audience you get the full
[50:43.960 --> 50:47.960]  details at trendsresearch.com whereas trend alerts everything else are posted
[50:47.960 --> 50:50.800]  but he's giving it to us here first I tried to get him on the last two weeks
[50:50.800 --> 50:54.400]  and he said well I'm traveling plus Alex I'm writing the 12 trends deep
[50:54.400 --> 50:59.120]  analysis I'd love to come on but I've got to come on once this is ready so
[50:59.120 --> 51:02.520]  you're hearing in here first and he'll be with us I guess five minutes to the
[51:02.520 --> 51:05.840]  next hour that he's got to go but we're very honored to have Gerald Salente of
[51:05.840 --> 51:10.160]  trendsresearch.com and I have here my little hands the top 12 trends of
[51:10.160 --> 51:15.720]  2012 but Gerald let me ask you the question this way today because I've
[51:15.720 --> 51:20.880]  read over these trends some of it is new some of it is you know basically
[51:20.880 --> 51:24.000]  tweaked analysis that you've already gone over but a lot of this is key
[51:24.000 --> 51:29.200]  groundbreaking material let me respect your analytical mind when it comes to
[51:29.200 --> 51:33.280]  this but do you want to give us an MF global update first or get into the top
[51:33.280 --> 51:38.240]  trends first and then I want to air this clip of the head of the CME group
[51:38.240 --> 51:42.720]  confirming so he's gone from criticizing you to now agreeing with you and saying
[51:42.720 --> 51:48.840]  Corzine did take the money and is lying well the update is this so far I've
[51:48.840 --> 51:58.160]  gotten they've reinstituted about 70% of the lost funds in my type of account
[51:58.160 --> 52:04.280]  having said that it's only part of the story because what happened is when they
[52:04.280 --> 52:11.720]  closed out my positions I remember I bought gold 1443 dollars an ounce I was
[52:11.720 --> 52:17.360]  going to pick up in December when they took all the money out they closed the
[52:17.360 --> 52:23.320]  positions down the day they went bankrupt and they remember I showed you the
[52:23.320 --> 52:32.800]  corrected statement it was now 1765 dollars an ounce not 1443 so when they
[52:32.800 --> 52:39.800]  went bankrupt and they closed and my positions closed out in December I had
[52:39.800 --> 52:46.160]  to sell them and I didn't buy him according to them at 1443 I bought him
[52:46.160 --> 52:53.800]  at 1765 so I had to eat those losses so now I have that problem on my hand now
[52:53.800 --> 52:59.080]  here's the best part of the deal you know I want whatever money I have I want
[52:59.080 --> 53:05.280]  to get it back right so I call up the broker remember the way they got the
[53:05.280 --> 53:11.200]  name broker is that you're broker than when you start that's how they made the
[53:11.200 --> 53:16.280]  name up so now I call them up I solicit a wire transfer whatever money I have in
[53:16.280 --> 53:22.800]  there get it into my bank check it out we can't do that we're gonna send you a
[53:22.800 --> 53:28.520]  check I try to mean you can't wire transfer me I said you guys never quit
[53:28.520 --> 53:34.440]  you're really quick to take the money when I wire transfer it in but you won't
[53:34.440 --> 53:42.680]  get it out so they won't wire transfer the money I haven't received it yet and
[53:42.680 --> 53:48.360]  now you know that story now it takes time for the check to clear and on and on
[53:48.360 --> 53:55.960]  now in saying this it's very important because as you will know I went public
[53:55.960 --> 54:02.480]  with this to warn people that what you think you have in your account really
[54:02.480 --> 54:09.360]  isn't yours because they have all of these loopholes in place where your money
[54:09.360 --> 54:15.360]  is only as safe as the last loophole that they put in and I don't care who
[54:15.360 --> 54:20.320]  it's with it makes no difference by the way I tried to go to a local bank and
[54:20.320 --> 54:25.320]  follow my advice and get out some cash and it wasn't even quote above the
[54:25.320 --> 54:30.280]  amount where they follow fence and deal you know it and and they acted like my
[54:30.280 --> 54:35.400]  wife was a crook freaked out and then started calling me saying we need to
[54:35.400 --> 54:38.800]  know your wife's occupation it's got to go in the federal financial crimes
[54:38.800 --> 54:44.480]  enforcement file and I'm like for less than $10,000 but even if it was
[54:44.480 --> 54:50.360]  $10,000 I mean what on earth I mean this country is a giant prison Gerald
[54:50.360 --> 54:55.280]  everywhere you're treated like trash and then all these little people they give
[54:55.280 --> 55:01.680]  it off on enforcing it on others it's sick it's like a nation of maggots you
[55:01.680 --> 55:04.760]  know you really hit on it you know as I've been saying you know your money
[55:04.760 --> 55:13.600]  isn't yours unless you have it and the story last Wednesday I called up HSBC
[55:13.600 --> 55:20.720]  and I told them that I was coming in Thursday morning at 9 30 in the morning
[55:20.720 --> 55:26.400]  to make a withdrawal I gave them the amount they said they only could give
[55:26.400 --> 55:30.120]  it to me in hundreds and fifties if I wanted to wait until Monday I could get
[55:30.120 --> 55:34.880]  it in hundreds I said that's fine I'll take it in 150s I couldn't make it at
[55:34.880 --> 55:41.120]  9 30 had my assistant call them up Mrs. Slenty will be in a 230 I go there with
[55:41.120 --> 55:46.640]  the check hand it to the person I was talking to on the phone it was like I
[55:46.640 --> 55:53.480]  never called now they tell me I have to go over I have this video on our site I
[55:53.480 --> 56:01.680]  have to go over and talk to the bank manager I go over there I sit down she
[56:01.680 --> 56:06.120]  looks at me and you talked about it these power-hungry little people she
[56:06.120 --> 56:14.240]  said to me what this is a sizable amount of money what are you going to use it
[56:14.240 --> 56:23.120]  for so I said how about none of your business so that's not very friendly I
[56:23.120 --> 56:30.640]  said how about none of your effing business how dare you ask me what I'm
[56:30.640 --> 56:38.520]  going to do with my money she said well you have to comply I said you didn't
[56:38.520 --> 56:43.600]  ask me how I got the money in there and now you're asking me what I'm gonna do
[56:43.600 --> 56:50.520]  with it there's a criminal imply you're a criminal exactly this went on for 40
[56:50.520 --> 56:57.920]  minutes I'm talking to people all over the HSBC chain first she tells me to
[56:57.920 --> 57:02.520]  leave the office she has to talk to compliance officer that's like these
[57:02.520 --> 57:07.800]  people that get arrested now for trying to get their own money out wait are you
[57:07.800 --> 57:10.880]  saying you have a video where you break this down or there's video of this no
[57:10.880 --> 57:14.920]  and I have pretty already break it down I wish I did have a video go back in
[57:14.920 --> 57:18.840]  there oh my god what else happened Cheryl break this oh my gosh and I'll

[57:30.760 --> 57:36.160]  are and how dare you ask me what I do with my money and now you're telling me
[57:36.160 --> 57:42.800]  you have to make a call to somebody and I can't be in the room as you talk
[57:42.800 --> 57:46.760]  about my money
[57:51.000 --> 57:55.800]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[57:55.800 --> 58:00.400]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda
[58:00.400 --> 58:04.600]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home after
[58:04.600 --> 58:09.400]  his influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[58:09.400 --> 58:14.640]  the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[58:14.640 --> 58:19.200]  attention for the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal

[59:56.560 --> 01:00:00.640]  Broadcasting Network
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:12.240]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:19.800]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.800 --> 01:00:26.720]  Alex Jones top trends forecaster Gerald Salente is our guest for this segment part
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:30.200]  of the next in the next segment I'm gonna play the clip of the head of the
[01:00:30.200 --> 01:00:36.320]  Chicago Mercantile exchange a month after denying course on run off the money
[01:00:36.320 --> 01:00:41.360]  changing his testimony and saying he did know where it went and ordered it and
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:44.240]  then we're gonna play the clip that Gerald was just mentioning but we're
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:47.760]  queuing it up right now to right where when Biden says it that they were
[01:00:47.760 --> 01:00:52.560]  talking about a bank holiday with their advisor core sign but we're gonna come
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:56.320]  back to that in a moment let's hurry through some of the other top 12 trends
[01:00:56.320 --> 01:01:00.400]  then we'll revisit those clips at the end of the interview battlefield America
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:07.520]  Gerald economic martial law they've taken our rights away from us with the
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:12.440]  National Defense Authorization Act everyone that's read it knows it or read
[01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:18.080]  the information coming out about it so my belief is that this system is breaking
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:23.440]  down and they're ready now to make sure that we don't get out of line so
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:30.040]  battlefield of battlefield America here we are that's what Lindsay that cracker
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:35.120]  from North Carolina South Carolina calls America and that's what they're
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:41.000]  making it so the battlefield is lining up so that they can instill martial law
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:46.920]  and also very important Alex is that these people are not as stupid as we
[01:01:46.920 --> 01:01:52.520]  think they are they know what's going on and they're just playing a con game to
[01:01:52.520 --> 01:01:58.000]  keep us con as they keep moving forward to rip us off more and more and
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:05.840]  subject us deeper and deeper into their psychopathic sickness by the way it got
[01:02:05.840 --> 01:02:12.000]  no attention Obama signed it Friday and I did Google searches and couldn't find
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:17.960]  it the guys just found it Politico it was a minor footnote in an article on
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:22.440]  Politico with no headline associated with it that Obama signed it so they
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:28.280]  even signed it and didn't want the public to know yeah I didn't know I
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:32.480]  didn't know he signed it either yeah I've got the signing statement right here
[01:02:32.480 --> 01:02:38.360]  and it did and this never made it never this never made the major news it was
[01:02:38.360 --> 01:02:47.200]  buried on page 831 in the bottom corner of the toilet paper of record the New
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:52.920]  York Times with it with a bland headline that mentioned nothing about what
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:59.200]  this law did well but they know they're gonna end up devaluing the money and
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:02.640]  stealing it and I guess I think the military is gonna protect them what's
[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:07.200]  gonna happen the military's checks don't don't don't cash well you know the
[01:03:07.200 --> 01:03:11.360]  military though whatever happens to this country it's happening like they
[01:03:11.360 --> 01:03:16.480]  happen in other third-world countries the military and the police become the
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:22.760]  enforcers for the criminal crime bosses they'll steal enough to pay them because
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:30.840]  they'll get every nickel out of us let's continue into your third trend let's
[01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:37.680]  get into invasion of the Occupy yes this is really huge what's happened with the
[01:03:37.680 --> 01:03:44.720]  octopi as we call it an octopi a a tentacle creature that's reaching out
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:50.640]  all over the world its strength is that it doesn't have a head to cut off like a
[01:03:50.640 --> 01:03:56.040]  Julian Assange wiki leaks was putting out valuable information but when they
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:04:02.760]  cut the head off the information died this octopi is a symptom of the war
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:09.160]  that's going on worldwide as I said before when the money stops flowing down
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:13.480]  to the man on the street the blood starts flowing in the streets these
[01:04:13.480 --> 01:04:21.200]  octopi's are in 80 countries in 1200 different cities they're going to
[01:04:21.200 --> 01:04:26.640]  continue and when you cut off one tentacle another one grows and the old
[01:04:26.640 --> 01:04:32.800]  one regenerates this is the beginning of that movement Alex that may change
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:38.120]  things in another direction okay let's let's race through the other seven or

[01:05:58.680 --> 01:06:11.000]  direct I am extremely honored to be joined by Bruce Fine his latest book
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:16.560]  is American Empire in fact we'll put it back up on screen for folks American
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:23.440]  Empire before the fall and we certainly are seeing the beginnings of the fall of
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:27.600]  this empire he of course worked at the US Department of Justice where he serves
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:31.280]  Assistant Director of the Office of Legal Policy he also worked in anti-trust
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:36.640]  he is a top advisor to many committees in Congress I'm constitutional law is
[01:06:36.640 --> 01:06:40.560]  constitutional lawyer and he is frequently quoted in the Financial Times of
[01:06:40.560 --> 01:06:45.120]  London New York Times you name it and I think his greatest claim to fame is he
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:50.360]  is the senior policy advisor to congressman and Dr. Ron Paul who is now
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:55.080]  in the lead in Iowa and in Nevada and other key states and is under an
[01:06:55.080 --> 01:06:59.360]  incredible bombardment of disinformation and propaganda from the corrupt
[01:06:59.360 --> 01:07:02.840]  establishment on both sides the left and right really certifying and
[01:07:02.840 --> 01:07:06.840]  signifying he's the real McCoy not just his sterling constitutional voting
[01:07:06.840 --> 01:07:10.320]  record and the Bruce Fine has been an advisor of his for many many years has
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:14.600]  been working hard on the campaign trail with him so I want to get into what's
[01:07:14.600 --> 01:07:19.200]  happening in the incredible police state expansion and also what's happening with
[01:07:19.200 --> 01:07:22.920]  Ron Paul for every action there's an equal and opposite reaction and Ron Paul
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:26.040]  and all the support I would say is a manifestation of that Bruce thanks for
[01:07:26.040 --> 01:07:30.280]  joining us from DC what should we get into first the giant police state power
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:35.400]  grab or Ron Paul's counter to it well I think we should get into the power grab
[01:07:35.400 --> 01:07:39.200]  first because that really transcends any individual candidate it's something
[01:07:39.200 --> 01:07:43.080]  that's going to come to haunt the United States not only today but in the
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:47.040]  future if we survive as a genuine sovereignty that celebrates the
[01:07:47.040 --> 01:07:51.520]  Republic and not only do we have this National Defense Authorization Act that
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:56.240]  Ron Paul condemned that crowns the military with authority to detain any
[01:07:56.240 --> 01:08:01.040]  of us for life in the United States if the president says we're substantially
[01:08:01.040 --> 01:08:06.640]  aiding an associated force of the Taliban to attack coalition forces a
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:12.240]  totally open-ended standard that now makes all of our liberties at the whim of
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:17.200]  the president and then we have this continuity in government revelation
[01:08:17.200 --> 01:08:22.680]  that we discussed earlier and that suspends democracy suspends the Republic
[01:08:22.680 --> 01:08:27.280]  in the event of some so-called emergency that the president declares or whatever
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:31.880]  standard of emergency is and basically pits the government against the people
[01:08:31.880 --> 01:08:37.440]  instead of that's an inversion of what the Constitution is about which says we
[01:08:37.440 --> 01:08:41.000]  the people are sovereign not the government the government is the steward
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:45.960]  of our liberties not the grantor of our liberties that are unalienable and we
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:51.440]  also know from stories recently that we have surveillance drones on the southwest
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:56.320]  border the government claiming they can surveil us from and the day we step out
[01:08:56.320 --> 01:09:00.800]  then the moment we step out of our house until we we go back into our bedroom
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:05.880]  without any probable cause without any warrants that's what's being made as a
[01:09:05.880 --> 01:09:10.440]  claim in the United States Supreme Court we're using predator drones to kill
[01:09:10.440 --> 01:09:14.360]  people based upon secret evidence and secret law that the president says he
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:18.600]  can't disclose there's no post-mortem there's no way to hold anyone accountable
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:23.840]  for these assassinations that remind me of of the gulag archipelago
[01:09:23.840 --> 01:09:28.680]  archipelago of sultan it's in you know during the soviet days and it never ends
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:32.600]  always more encroachment on liberty always more encroachment on privacy in
[01:09:32.600 --> 01:09:38.240]  that this this feudal quest for so-called absolute risk-free existence which is a
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:42.520]  guarantee of simply detaining and arresting everyone on the theory that
[01:09:42.520 --> 01:09:47.920]  we're not all saints truly horrifying I think development in the the incredible
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:51.960]  thing is there's so little resistance Ron Paul ran Paul voted against these
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:57.320]  kinds of bills in the Senate but it's really a handful overall only 13 senators
[01:09:57.320 --> 01:10:04.480]  out of 100 opposed this tyrannical rule Ron Paul himself I think as is the one
[01:10:04.480 --> 01:10:08.360]  person standing as a beacon there recognizing and willing unlike all the
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:13.360]  other candidates to argue against this police state that makes a safety as
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:17.240]  opposed to liberty and freedom they are the touchstone of the country even though
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:22.240]  that the safety really is an illusion because when you create a belief that
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:26.840]  all citizens are disloyal little create cynicism and a sense that the government
[01:10:26.840 --> 01:10:30.680]  then becomes illegitimate and the greatest strength any country has is the
[01:10:30.680 --> 01:10:34.320]  allegiance and loyalty of its people that's the greatest strength and not
[01:10:34.320 --> 01:10:38.240]  not the weapons now that was my things that sort certainly I mean I mean in the
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:41.760]  last few decades the military industrial complex the big crony capitalist
[01:10:41.760 --> 01:10:45.880]  non-free market mega banks they've tried to keep the velvet glove on the iron
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:49.280]  fist but now because Congress for now what two years is at a 9% approval
[01:10:49.280 --> 01:10:53.720]  rating even liberals big government people say they fear big government more
[01:10:53.720 --> 01:10:57.240]  than you know the free market and corporations now so there is an awakening
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:11:02.400]  so I think the system is just dispensing with even the ceremony now I mean we
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:05.760]  were talking about this before we went live here this is from the White House
[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:10.480]  website two weeks ago strategic implementation for plan for empowering
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:14.160]  local partners to prevent violent extremism in the United States and it's
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:18.160]  a federal announcement saying domestic terrorist number one threat and speech
[01:11:18.160 --> 01:11:23.080]  criticizing the government there's bizarre quotes in here is aiding
[01:11:23.080 --> 01:11:28.440]  terror and there's a president Obama quote in here where he says I'll read it
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:32.400]  as a government we are working to prevent all types of extremism so now
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:36.720]  terrorism is extremism that leads to violence oh see the extremism the talk
[01:11:36.720 --> 01:11:40.480]  leads to violence regardless of who inspires it and they go on to say we're
[01:11:40.480 --> 01:11:45.120]  now worried about domestic groups mainly right wing quote as the at the time the
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:49.440]  same time countering al-qaeda's violent ideology is one part of the comprehensive
[01:11:49.440 --> 01:11:53.600]  strategy to defeat al-qaeda over the past two and a half years more key al-qaeda
[01:11:53.600 --> 01:11:56.800]  leaders including a son of a lot and have been eliminated or in rapid
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:12:00.280]  succession than any times in September 11th we have strengthened Homeland
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:04.240]  Security and improved information sharing thanks to coordinated intelligence and
[01:12:04.240 --> 01:12:08.440]  law enforcement numerous terrorist plots have been thwarted of saving many
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:14.640]  American lives and then they go on to say extremism extreme talk is now aiding
[01:12:14.640 --> 01:12:19.080]  al-qaeda and so it makes this bridge and if you read deeper into this that
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:23.400]  they're going to be you use the NDA the military basically against the American
[01:12:23.400 --> 01:12:26.200]  people as we know with the Mayak and Homeland Security reports that law
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:29.920]  enforcement sent me three years ago none of this has to do with foreign
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:33.840]  threats or al-qaeda and all this talk it's always about tea partiers Ron Paul
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:38.520]  Bob Barr constitutionalist I mean what does this signify as a constitutional
[01:12:38.520 --> 01:12:43.200]  lawyer and an expert well it shows that the Constitution has been vandalized by
[01:12:43.200 --> 01:12:47.640]  the government and they the government needs to be held accountable and it
[01:12:47.640 --> 01:12:51.880]  turns they say the idea of the Republic on its head the glory of a republic is
[01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:55.840]  liberty the individual is the center of our constitutional solar system
[01:12:55.840 --> 01:13:00.760]  in an empire what we've got today big government encroaching on all of our
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:05.040]  liberties is the earmark and dominion and domination is the so-called glory of
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:10.120]  an empire so then we were so far away from the Constitution as it was drafted
[01:13:10.120 --> 01:13:15.160]  and understood and celebrated 220 years ago and that we might as well be King
[01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:19.800]  George III the president of the United States at present enjoys more authority
[01:13:19.800 --> 01:13:25.560]  than King George who we overthrew because of his tyrannical powers in 1776
[01:13:25.560 --> 01:13:31.360]  that is where we are the Constitution has been so defaced it's it's been so
[01:13:31.360 --> 01:13:36.760]  warped to just empower the government to encroach and stamp and destroy our
[01:13:36.760 --> 01:13:40.640]  liberties and now when they're suggesting freedom of speech the freedom to
[01:13:40.640 --> 01:13:44.440]  criticize the government which should be welcomed since the government airs so
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:49.160]  often they need instruction rather than echo chambers is now being made suspect
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:53.560]  and indeed we had the situation when the Patriot Act was passed shortly after 9
[01:13:53.560 --> 01:13:57.080]  11 where the then Attorney General said anybody who criticized the Patriot Act
[01:13:57.080 --> 01:14:02.680]  was aiding and embedding the enemy you know it's it's it's this delusion that
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:06.840]  causes the president Obama to say he doesn't understand why people in
[01:14:06.840 --> 01:14:10.640]  Afghanistan or Pakistan are trying to kill our soldiers just because we're
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:14.440]  trying to shoot them you know maybe it's because if we stop shooting them then
[01:14:14.440 --> 01:14:17.640]  they wouldn't be protesting with violence and maybe if the government
[01:14:17.640 --> 01:14:21.520]  obeying the Constitution they wouldn't get the extreme speech and I don't want
[01:14:21.520 --> 01:14:26.000]  to suggest that we're at the that the precipice of justifying you know violent
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:30.240]  revolution but we never should forget that in that declaration of independence
[01:14:30.240 --> 01:14:34.280]  that Thomas Jefferson wrote in all of our founding fathers subscribe to which
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:39.120]  says when a government evinces a consistent train of action that
[01:14:39.120 --> 01:14:44.880]  displays an intent to reduce us to vassals there's not only a right a duty to
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:49.280]  change and overthrow the government and to supply a new dispensation that will
[01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:53.760]  protect our liberties and the government's got to recognize you cannot
[01:14:53.760 --> 01:14:59.160]  continue to try to oppress all of our opportunities to speak and argue and to
[01:14:59.160 --> 01:15:03.680]  display total and complete opposition to what we think are vandalizations of
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:08.520]  our constitutional rights and expect to retain power one of the things that I
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:13.200]  think is most unfortunate because of the historical ways in which it was some
[01:15:13.200 --> 01:15:16.600]  respects was discredited we need to go to the impeachment power you know
[01:15:16.600 --> 01:15:19.840]  Congress needs to stand up to the plate the members should be impeached
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:23.280]  themselves if they're not honoring Constitution and any president of the
[01:15:23.280 --> 01:15:27.360]  United States who says that he can use the military to arrest us because he
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:31.800]  says that he suspects we're substantially aiding now Al Qaeda or to
[01:15:31.800 --> 01:15:35.120]  Alabama we don't have a right to do rebut it there's no trial there's no
[01:15:35.120 --> 01:15:39.720]  accusation we just get to rock now why would Congress should not stay well I
[01:15:39.720 --> 01:15:43.880]  mean there's several questions here but it's all intriguing and is the big
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:48.800]  issue of the day why would the Congress try to give the president the power of
[01:15:48.800 --> 01:15:50.840]  the dictation
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:58.840]  it's to a error
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:10.280]  tyranny is here the grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality it really

[01:20:06.680 --> 01:20:10.640]  Broadcasting Network
[01:20:12.160 --> 01:20:16.000]  Ron Paul the Congress when the presidential candidate was on my radio
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:20.960]  show last Tuesday and the video of its gone around the web has been seen
[01:20:20.960 --> 01:20:27.760]  millions of times it's radio slash TV and he said but basically what you've
[01:20:27.760 --> 01:20:31.800]  said but but but he said the NDAA the National Defense Authorization Act
[01:20:31.800 --> 01:20:36.560]  establishes martial law in this country and that's what Jonathan Turley said
[01:20:36.560 --> 01:20:41.080]  that's what basically what you've said and literally more than 200 if you go to
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:45.760]  Google News and type in Ron Paul Alex Jones from that interview more than 200
[01:20:45.760 --> 01:20:52.640]  newspapers CBS ABC TV basically said Ron Paul's an extremist and dangerous and
[01:20:52.640 --> 01:20:57.240]  groups said that's why he's being kicked out of the upcoming debate this shows
[01:20:57.240 --> 01:21:01.440]  why he's so off track meanwhile it's all over the news that they're putting
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:05.640]  military on the streets in Illinois and Louisiana it's on CNN two days ago
[01:21:05.640 --> 01:21:10.520]  they're calling for troops to stop crime the TSA setting up checkpoints now on
[01:21:10.520 --> 01:21:15.280]  highways in Tennessee in other areas that's this is all happening they're
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:19.800]  saying they're going to do this and then Ron Paul says you know look the
[01:21:19.800 --> 01:21:23.520]  emperor wears no clothes and they howl that he's nuts I mean this is a weird
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:27.280]  paradox where everything you've warned about he's warned about others have
[01:21:27.280 --> 01:21:32.280]  warned about for decades is now manifesting and there's separately
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:36.360]  pushing military on the streets but then saying Ron Paul's crazy because he
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:42.240]  doesn't want it because it doesn't exist I mean what is this well it's what
[01:21:42.240 --> 01:21:47.520]  Sam Taylor College called a temporary suspension of disbelief it's it's
[01:21:47.520 --> 01:21:52.520]  really Orwellian is the only word I can think of it you know call Ron Paul an
[01:21:52.520 --> 01:21:56.280]  extremist for defending and honoring the Constitution of the United States and
[01:21:56.280 --> 01:22:00.480]  the non extremists are the ones who are in favor of destroying the rule of law
[01:22:00.480 --> 01:22:06.640]  and and imposing a government that we overthrew 220 some years ago called
[01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:12.880]  Great Britain with a monarch I mean it's hardly even have words to describe you
[01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:16.600]  know the absurdity of the characterization Ron is the one who
[01:22:16.600 --> 01:22:19.600]  would have been there at the Battle of Bunker Hill you know these guys would
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:24.680]  all been with the Tories and with the King and it is an example however that
[01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:29.800]  those who are in power don't want to yield it and power corrupts absolute
[01:22:29.800 --> 01:22:33.640]  union indicated well why has Congress crowned the president with such
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:37.600]  overwhelming authority I say it's because Congress has become the
[01:22:37.600 --> 01:22:42.400]  invertebrate branch of government and it wants to surrender all authority to
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:45.360]  the president because it doesn't want to be held accountable for anything they
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:49.840]  feel they have cushion jobs they get the money to come you know to pay them their
[01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:53.600]  campaign expenses and they'll sit there and act like they're in a movie and
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:58.200]  they enjoy the momentary thrill of getting on the television or radio from
[01:22:58.200 --> 01:23:02.640]  time to time but they do not want accountability they want to run away
[01:23:02.640 --> 01:23:06.200]  from accountability that's why every time you come to a crunch where you're
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:09.200]  gonna have to decide whether really gonna cut government back what does
[01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:13.200]  Congress do kick the ball down the road two months six months seven months but
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:17.200]  never actually doing anything other than postponing today it's like a little
[01:23:17.200 --> 01:23:21.200]  kid procrastinating and that's the one element I believe the founding fathers
[01:23:21.200 --> 01:23:25.200]  were just stunned I didn't think it's a branch would surrender power but I
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:30.200]  think the reason why they misconceived how this has evolved here in 2011 is
[01:23:30.200 --> 01:23:35.200]  that the political parties have replaced the Constitution as the source of the
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:39.200]  allegiance of these members of Congress they believe their Democrats and
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:43.200]  Republicans Dallas Cowboys Washington Redskins or New Orleans Saints but
[01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:47.200]  they're not American now it's just their side and they play like this is
[01:23:47.200 --> 01:23:51.200]  really just a game it's not for the people of the United States and that's
[01:23:51.200 --> 01:23:55.200]  why hey as long as their guys in power hey give them all the power that you
[01:23:55.200 --> 01:24:00.200]  want because that'll help you in the next election cycle and it happens on
[01:24:00.200 --> 01:24:05.200]  both sides and we've got to get rid of that idea there's only one oath that
[01:24:05.200 --> 01:24:09.200]  members of Congress take that's to the Constitution of the United States they
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:12.200]  do not take an oath to the Republicans or Democrats to the present the
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:15.200]  Constitution alone let me go back to this question I want to get into Ron
[01:24:15.200 --> 01:24:18.200]  Paul briefly before you got it goes I know you're very busy sir you're heading
[01:24:18.200 --> 01:24:23.200]  up a lot of the campaign you know policies and things and supporting
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:29.200]  Congressman Paul but Bruce looking at this and I mean really working in
[01:24:29.200 --> 01:24:33.200]  government being around these people for decades studying it why are they
[01:24:33.200 --> 01:24:37.200]  moving so quickly I mean even I am shocked by the speed of it and I've been
[01:24:37.200 --> 01:24:40.200]  seeing this develop for a while people said oh you're being extreme but now
[01:24:40.200 --> 01:24:43.200]  it's moving faster than I even thought and I'm instead of getting chills once a
[01:24:43.200 --> 01:24:47.200]  week of concern I'm getting them every 30 seconds I mean I can feel the
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:51.200]  tyranny rising not just see it I can you know intellectually it's right there but
[01:24:51.200 --> 01:24:57.200]  also in my gut why is the system moving at light speed towards total
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:25:05.200]  despotism classical naked on fire North Korean style you know Kim Jong-il is
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:10.200]  God Obama is God anybody who doesn't like it's an enemy what is driving this
[01:25:10.200 --> 01:25:16.200]  well it's a unique and curious feature of Empire that as actual danger
[01:25:16.200 --> 01:25:23.200]  diminishes the sense of crisis climbs and there becomes this idea that oh we're
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:27.200]  super powerful we're big government there should be no risk at all we need to
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:33.200]  control everything that move even though the genuine danger is close to zero and
[01:25:33.200 --> 01:25:38.200]  that's just in the human species when you give someone uncontrolled unlimited
[01:25:38.200 --> 01:25:44.200]  power they want to destroy any element of risk or contingency whatsoever and
[01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:50.200]  they do that by exerting authority police military courts money or otherwise
[01:25:50.200 --> 01:25:55.200]  taxation regulation or something like that and that's what that is what you
[01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:59.200]  would call the pathology of Empire says this is crazy take a look Alex at this
[01:25:59.200 --> 01:26:05.200]  NDA when does it pass 10 years after 9 11 9 11 we had some fog we didn't know
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:09.200]  whether Al Qaeda penetrated the country now we know how insignificant they are
[01:26:09.200 --> 01:26:13.200]  there are international criminal thugs but they're 50 of them in Afghanistan
[01:26:13.200 --> 01:26:17.200]  and there are no cells in the United States so why are we creating this
[01:26:17.200 --> 01:26:21.200]  draconian authority 10 years after we know it's irrelevant and also think of
[01:26:21.200 --> 01:26:27.200]  this Alex there were no congressional hearings on the NDA not one it emerged
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:31.200]  out of the Senate Armed Services Committee Lindsey Graham John McCain it
[01:26:31.200 --> 01:26:35.200]  didn't go to judiciary didn't go to intelligence there was not a single
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:39.200]  congressional finding that any of these authorities were necessary to make us
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:43.200]  safe it just appeared so you have to ask you know this is really well that's like
[01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:47.200]  the Super Congress where where this committee of 12 with the president is
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:52.200]  the 13th you know my guess Merovingian leader or whatever they just to come up
[01:26:52.200 --> 01:26:56.200]  with a policy that you could up or down voted and then it kicks back if you don't
[01:26:56.200 --> 01:27:02.200]  but what do you make then of all these moves towards Iran I mean is that just
[01:27:02.200 --> 01:27:08.200]  a another desperate way to try to make themselves be the heroes of the people
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:12.200]  claiming they're knocking out some new threat well absolutely you can see the
[01:27:12.200 --> 01:27:16.200]  drum beats are already there the Secretary of Defense Panetta and said
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:21.200]  just a couple days ago on CBS News oh less than a year Iran will certainly
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:25.200]  have a nuclear weapon and that is simply not acceptable so he's trying to
[01:27:25.200 --> 01:27:30.200]  already create the justification for going to war and I asked well you know
[01:27:30.200 --> 01:27:34.200]  Mr. Panetta I was alive at the Cuban Missile Crisis we have a retaliatory
[01:27:34.200 --> 01:27:39.200]  capacity that could incinerate Iran and then the Soviet Union doesn't deterrence
[01:27:39.200 --> 01:27:43.200]  work it worked against the Soviets had huge number of missiles and when you
[01:27:43.200 --> 01:27:47.200]  talk about well Iran is the only people in the history of the world deterrence
[01:27:47.200 --> 01:27:51.200]  doesn't work they all crave self-destruction I said well that true
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:56.200]  this this Islamic regime is zany and and and and Iraq as it is they didn't
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:28:00.200]  release our hostages after a long prolonged negotiations they didn't go to war
[01:28:00.200 --> 01:28:04.200]  they ended the war with Saddam Hussein over Iraq they negotiated reparations
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:09.200]  when we shot down a plane by USS Vincent and they now accepted Israel the
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:13.200]  US and England launching covert strikes including now it's coming out aircraft
[01:28:13.200 --> 01:28:18.200]  covert bombings missile bases you name it they've even put up with that it's
[01:28:18.200 --> 01:28:23.200]  clear the West strategy is to poke them until they do something yeah I mean
[01:28:23.200 --> 01:28:27.200]  including assassinating their scientists so they had they they're like
[01:28:27.200 --> 01:28:32.200]  listen North Korea and engages in rational you know behavior as well even
[01:28:32.200 --> 01:28:36.200]  though it's got crazy leaders there so deterrence works so why are we going in
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:40.200]  there and it's not to encourage proliferation you know I'm not happy
[01:28:40.200 --> 01:28:44.200]  Pakistan as a nuclear weapon I'm not happy North Korea as nuclear weapon I'm
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:49.200]  not happy their nuclear weapons at all but we have to deal with reality out
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:52.200]  there and deterrence is the way you prevent this from being used in a
[01:28:52.200 --> 01:28:56.200]  reckless way there's only one country in the world that's ever actually used
[01:28:56.200 --> 01:29:00.200]  a weapon it's called the United States of America
[01:29:01.200 --> 01:29:06.200]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this is
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:11.200]  our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:14.200]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[01:29:14.200 --> 01:29:19.200]  I've turned the members influence on our president in Congress and they really
[01:29:19.200 --> 01:29:24.200]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[01:29:24.200 --> 01:29:28.200]  citizens to pay attention fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of
[01:29:28.200 --> 01:29:33.200]  our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:37.200]  and on its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke
[01:29:37.200 --> 01:29:41.200]  their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:45.200]  do we make the checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in

[01:33:07.200 --> 01:33:10.200]  network network
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:30.200]  and we are joined by Republican front runner presidential candidate Ron Paul
[01:33:30.200 --> 01:33:34.200]  even mainstream media admits he's in second third in some cases first place
[01:33:34.200 --> 01:33:38.200]  and of course the national polls he's the only person who can beat president
[01:33:38.200 --> 01:33:43.200]  Obama and he joins us today congressman thank you for coming on thank you
[01:33:43.200 --> 01:33:46.200]  Alex good to be with you again it's good to have you with us there is so much
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:51.200]  happening I've got a lot of questions but what is most important congressman
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:56.200]  right now on your radar well it's continuing to do what I've been doing
[01:33:56.200 --> 01:34:00.200]  you know a lot of people say well what's your strategy we're gonna do differently
[01:34:00.200 --> 01:34:04.200]  and you know me well enough that probably the last 30 years especially the last 10 years
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:08.200]  since we've known each other I do the same thing over and over again but I try to improve
[01:34:08.200 --> 01:34:13.200]  not only the delivery but the message always stays the same but we we get better organized
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:17.200]  so we'll continue to do that and the next I mean the big thing now is these next three weeks
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:22.200]  I mean you know how much energy we put into Iowa and New Hampshire because you know
[01:34:22.200 --> 01:34:26.200]  it offers an opportunity it's a smaller state and you can meet a lot of people
[01:34:26.200 --> 01:34:31.200]  you can do direct mail so we've done our very very best we think we're in a good position
[01:34:31.200 --> 01:34:35.200]  but we're going to work right up until you know the caucuses occur on the third
[01:34:35.200 --> 01:34:40.200]  and of course the primary in New Hampshire on the 10th but it's unbelievable how much
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:45.200]  volunteer work we're getting and there's so much work going on outside of the campaign
[01:34:45.200 --> 01:34:51.200]  that's so fantastic so I believe that could be our secret weapon that nobody measures
[01:34:51.200 --> 01:34:55.200]  the amount of activity going on outside the campaign but we're going to continue to do
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:58.200]  exactly what we're doing with a lot more energy.
[01:34:58.200 --> 01:35:03.200]  They continue to try to sell this mind game with a self-fulfilling prophecy that
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:07.200]  even though he wins all these straw polls and even though he's always a top tier candidate
[01:35:07.200 --> 01:35:12.200]  you still can't have him but I think that hoax is really beginning to backfire on them.
[01:35:12.200 --> 01:35:17.200]  Yeah I don't know how long they can get away with you know if Newt wins at Iowa
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:22.200]  you know he's the shoe in for the whole nomination if I win it's a total fluke
[01:35:22.200 --> 01:35:28.200]  and I'm just a troublemaker and a spoiler but we still have to prove ourselves
[01:35:28.200 --> 01:35:32.200]  under the circumstances of the disadvantages with the Main Street media
[01:35:32.200 --> 01:35:36.200]  but we know we know where we stand we know what we have to overcome
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:43.200]  and I think we're doing a very good job on this and no matter how they spin it
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:49.200]  there's a limit to how much they can spin it you know even when they give me 90 seconds
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:52.200]  actually we've been able to turn that around and turn it into a positive
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:56.200]  when you see guys like John Stewart and others you know just mocking
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:36:01.200]  you know the unfairness of the system so we have to keep plugging along that's all.
[01:36:01.200 --> 01:36:05.200]  They've tried to ignore you now that's failing the attacks are beginning
[01:36:05.200 --> 01:36:08.200]  do you think that it's going to do the same thing again and boomerang back on them
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:12.200]  because the Main Street media and political system is so discredited?
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:19.200]  Yeah I think so in a way even though you know the king makers and the Main Street media
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:24.200]  and the establishment people are gunning you know the other candidates
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:28.200]  have you noticed they're a little less aggressive they're more aggressive against each other
[01:36:28.200 --> 01:36:32.200]  than they are against me because I think they know the significance of the number of people
[01:36:32.200 --> 01:36:35.200]  and they're not going out of their way to offend
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:39.200]  they say oh there's just a couple percent there's seven or eight percent
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:43.200]  they're being a lot more cautious because they know our percentages are much higher
[01:36:43.200 --> 01:36:47.200]  and we can play a significant role and they're being a little more cautious at least.
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:52.200]  If you were to go after Obama more pretty much run against Obama
[01:36:52.200 --> 01:36:56.200]  transcend the other Republican minions and point out as you have that
[01:36:56.200 --> 01:37:01.200]  they're basically just rhino Republican versions of that
[01:37:01.200 --> 01:37:05.200]  and point out that you've pointed out the real problems
[01:37:05.200 --> 01:37:10.200]  and you're the only candidate that has any shot at trying to turn the ship around.
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:14.200]  Well actually I think that is good strategy because I wish we had more polling
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:20.200]  honest polling with my name against Obama because you know we appealed to a lot of independence
[01:37:20.200 --> 01:37:24.200]  and even some of the more sensible and honest liberals you know that progressed
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:28.200]  that are anti-war so I think what you're suggesting is very good
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:31.200]  and I would have to admit that I don't do enough of that
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:35.200]  and I think it's a mixed bag politically I think is very very good
[01:37:35.200 --> 01:37:38.200]  and he deserves it and that's who ultimately you have to run against
[01:37:38.200 --> 01:37:42.200]  but in the primary I'm not running against him and I also like to be as upfront as possible
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:47.200]  you know when it comes to analyzing our tragedies and the foreign policy and monetary policy
[01:37:47.200 --> 01:37:52.200]  and the economic full partiness of it and you know they've been going on for a long time
[01:37:52.200 --> 01:37:57.200]  and it's both parties but I should at least be more bipartisan and condemn Obama
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:02.200]  just as much as I criticize some of the things Republicans have done over the years as well
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:07.200]  Look at Mitt Romney, his voting record, Obamacare, he is a Republican Obama
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:13.200]  Vote in another Obama or look at Newt Gennrich, he's for carbon taxes, Obamacare-style stuff
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:18.200]  he is another Obama and so basically A, it's a vote for Obama
[01:38:18.200 --> 01:38:20.200]  because either one of those guys is going to beat Obama
[01:38:20.200 --> 01:38:23.200]  but B, it's a vote for Obama because they're just clones of him
[01:38:23.200 --> 01:38:28.200]  just with a little bit different rhetoric, I think that that is the secret weapon congressman
[01:38:28.200 --> 01:38:34.200]  and I got a little bit of that in but probably not as sharp as I could have or what you might have done
[01:38:34.200 --> 01:38:38.200]  but you know in the debate the other night I said the two of them are totally on the defense
[01:38:38.200 --> 01:38:43.200]  they're defending their record, I mean how can they lead our party
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:49.200]  if they're defending themselves for not being, you know, for having been like Obama all along
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:57.200]  so that is the big issue and I think probably, you know, Gennrich has been pretty aggressive in that light
[01:38:57.200 --> 01:39:00.200]  so maybe that's one of the reasons he got bumped up a bit
[01:39:00.200 --> 01:39:02.200]  so that's not a bad advice at all
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:09.200]  RonPaul2012.com, it is absolutely essential, obviously everybody go out and get ready to try to be delegates
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:14.200]  everybody hit the ground in Iowa, I know I have family who's actually gone to Iowa
[01:39:14.200 --> 01:39:20.200]  so there is a massive grassroots operation, all the different ways people can get involved are at RonPaul2012.com
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:23.200]  I want to go back to the campaign here in a moment sir
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:28.200]  but they've obviously tried to keep you with 89 seconds in the CBS debate and other places
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:32.200]  from actually talking about the real issues and instead they'll ask you what do you think are new
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:38.200]  what do you think commit so they can basically still give you time and not get caught censoring you
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:42.200]  but they still censor you in another way, what do you have to say about that?
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:46.200]  Well, I mean that's been ongoing and I've lived with that for a long time
[01:39:46.200 --> 01:39:50.200]  I have to be on guard for it and try to distract from them
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:58.200]  but that's ultimately their goal is to make a subtle if not want assumption that well, you can't win
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:02.200]  and therefore we shouldn't pay a whole lot of attention to you
[01:40:02.200 --> 01:40:06.200]  but the only way we can ultimately overcome that is success in Iowa
[01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:14.200]  as a beginning point, if we do really well there, they're going to have a lot harder time doing that to us
[01:40:14.200 --> 01:40:19.200]  I saw the Republicans here in Austin are going to protest Eric Holder, the Attorney General today
[01:40:19.200 --> 01:40:24.200]  because he wants the UN to oversee our elections and I agree that's certainly out of control and treasonous
[01:40:24.200 --> 01:40:29.200]  but this is the guy caught perjuring himself in the memo CBS released last week
[01:40:29.200 --> 01:40:34.200]  show that they said they were going to blame the guns in Mexico on the Second Amendment
[01:40:34.200 --> 01:40:39.200]  is that not a form of false flag against our most basic of rights here
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:44.200]  and what would you do in president to people like Eric Holder?
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:49.200]  Well, he should be immediately fired and there should be an investigation and find out if charges should be made
[01:40:49.200 --> 01:40:56.200]  and that's obviously over the top and all these kind of sting operations and false flag
[01:40:56.200 --> 01:41:01.200]  this is criminal and I think they do it constantly, I think they were doing that
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:08.200]  when there was this so-called attempt to kill the Saudi or the Iranian ambassador
[01:41:08.200 --> 01:41:13.200]  that kind of stuff is just way too much, but no, they should be investigating
[01:41:13.200 --> 01:41:21.200]  and that's one thing I think the government and the House committee is doing a pretty good job of investigating that
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:27.200]  but I don't know whether charges will be made but the he deserves to have charges up against him
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:33.200]  Well said, you got it right the first time, the claim of the youth car salesman wanting to kill the Saudi ambassador
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:38.200]  and even mainstream media had to admit that was totally phony and a pretext to attack Iran
[01:41:38.200 --> 01:41:46.200]  Yeah, that was the real excuse to blame it on them and we know that is...
[01:41:46.200 --> 01:41:51.200]  You know, I just wonder about that whether that kind of whatever gets tried because maybe the truth will come out
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:55.200]  and sometimes they won't try these people because they don't want the truth to come out
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:59.200]  so it's just another propaganda stunt as far as I'm concerned
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:06.200]  Now they want to go after Syria, it's now admitted the US, Israel and others are staging giant military attacks inside Iran
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:09.200]  What do you make of Congress not being consulted on that?
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:15.200]  Well, unfortunately that's been happening for a long time and Congress is just totally negligent
[01:42:15.200 --> 01:42:19.200]  on this, you know, the other night when they were talking about this in the debates
[01:42:19.200 --> 01:42:26.200]  on what the president's responsibility is when they, you know, shoot down or are able to get one of our drones
[01:42:26.200 --> 01:42:32.200]  and the argument was should we go in and get it or should we just go in and destroy it
[01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:37.200]  and I tried to hit a ditch on that, my suggestion would be why don't we avoid it
[01:42:37.200 --> 01:42:43.200]  by not sending drones over a sovereign nation just looking for a problem to start another war
[01:42:43.200 --> 01:42:49.200]  I mean they never talked about, you know, the lack of wisdom of having been over there
[01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:53.200]  and losing a drone over a foreign nation which we consider an enemy
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:43:16.200]  I just think that it's a reflection of a policy that has to be changed
[01:43:24.200 --> 01:43:41.200]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system

[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:11.200]  It really says that the state is God
[01:46:11.200 --> 01:46:17.200]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most impressive police states on Earth
[01:46:17.200 --> 01:46:24.200]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:30.200]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an old powerful shadow state

[01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:09.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:16.200]  We are under chemical and biological attack
[01:47:16.200 --> 01:47:21.200]  The scientific dictatorship sought to not only overthrow nation states
[01:47:21.200 --> 01:47:25.200]  But to destroy the family and the human species itself
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:27.200]  All of us are under attack
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:32.200]  The global technocrats launch their assaults through covert means
[01:47:32.200 --> 01:47:35.200]  Through our water and food supplies
[01:47:35.200 --> 01:47:37.200]  As well as household items
[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:41.200]  Food, packaging, prescription and over the counter drugs
[01:47:41.200 --> 01:47:48.200]  All of these systems used to deliver their covert Trojan horse payloads of control
[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:52.200]  If we are unsuccessful in stopping these technocratic madmen
[01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:56.200]  Humanity as we know it is a thing of the past
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:48:01.200]  The report that you are about to see documents this horrific fact in detail
[01:48:01.200 --> 01:48:04.200]  What you do with the information is up to you
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:06.200]  You have been warned
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:11.200]  The information that you are about to see in here
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:18.200]  Is some of the most important info that you will ever witness in your life
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:21.200]  I can say that unequivocally
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:28.200]  And I am begging you for the sake of you and your family and for our human family
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:33.200]  To please take notes to check the different documents and news articles
[01:48:33.200 --> 01:48:36.200]  That we are going to show you here today
[01:48:36.200 --> 01:48:40.200]  And prove to yourself that we are telling you the truth
[01:48:40.200 --> 01:48:44.200]  In fact we are only scratching the surface
[01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:50.200]  There is a private global corporate government now operating in the open
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:56.200]  That is based on the quack science of eugenics
[01:48:56.200 --> 01:49:00.200]  And to put that in a pop culture context
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:05.200]  In the general public will understand that Hitler was a eugenicist
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:09.200]  And he got his ideas from scientists in England and the United States
[01:49:09.200 --> 01:49:15.200]  Now the robber barons like the Rockefellers that funded Hitler early on
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:21.200]  In the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute still control this nation and much of the world today
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:25.200]  And the entire development of modern sciences
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:32.200]  Through large tax-free foundations and government funding and DARPA that President Eisenhower warned us about
[01:49:32.200 --> 01:49:38.200]  Has been in the direction of basically creating an artificial habitat
[01:49:38.200 --> 01:49:44.200]  An artificial system where the scientific dictators or the technocrats as they call themselves
[01:49:44.200 --> 01:49:48.200]  Play god over us and manipulate us
[01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:51.200]  They see us as lab rats, as guinea pigs
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:49:56.200]  Now in the last decade I've talked a lot about eugenics
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:50:00.200]  Really for more than 16 years on air but intensely for 10 years or more
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:04.200]  And in the different documents that we are going to show you here
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:08.200]  We found the UN documents, the Planned Parenthood documents
[01:50:08.200 --> 01:50:12.200]  The world population organization documents
[01:50:12.200 --> 01:50:15.200]  Where they openly discussed breaking up the family
[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:21.200]  Getting rid of the quote arcane institution so they could have their international collectivist system
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:25.200]  Shutting down all competition against the ultra-rich
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:29.200]  That is the system that we face as a society
[01:50:29.200 --> 01:50:31.200]  I'm going to go over some of those documents
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:33.200]  But up front I want to just say this
[01:50:33.200 --> 01:50:36.200]  The system is scared to death of this information
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:43.200]  Three years ago they had a bunch of different George Soros affiliated, Democratic Party affiliated groups
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:50.200]  Come out against me and really simplify the straw man that they built
[01:50:50.200 --> 01:50:57.200]  And go after me by saying Alex Jones says the government is putting chemicals in your food and water to make UK
[01:50:57.200 --> 01:51:01.200]  What I had actually said was
[01:51:01.200 --> 01:51:07.200]  This phenol A alone that's in thousands of plastic products, printer ink
[01:51:07.200 --> 01:51:09.200]  You name it
[01:51:09.200 --> 01:51:14.200]  Is lowering male fertility, is a estrogen mimicker
[01:51:14.200 --> 01:51:19.200]  And is feminizing boys and men and hyperfeminizing women
[01:51:19.200 --> 01:51:24.200]  And has been linked in major studies to breast cancer and other cancers
[01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:27.200]  It is devastating our society
[01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:36.200]  And these hormonal disruptors are actually running off into the lakes, streams and rivers
[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:47.200]  And confusing the sexual reproduction of nutrient rats, rodents, fish, turtles, you name it
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:52.200]  This is a toxic waste and it is added to our water
[01:51:52.200 --> 01:51:54.200]  It is added to our food
[01:51:54.200 --> 01:51:59.200]  It is added through the plastics that are in almost everything
[01:51:59.200 --> 01:52:04.200]  To our daily lives to reduce our fertility
[01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:08.200]  Now I want to show you first this document
[01:52:08.200 --> 01:52:13.200]  This is from Planned Parenthood to the president of the Population Council
[01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:16.200]  That was tied in with the United Nations
[01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:22.200]  And in it they break down in 1969 plans to lower population and destroy the family
[01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:25.200]  A, postpone or avoid marriage
[01:52:25.200 --> 01:52:31.200]  B, alter image of ideal family size, demonize having more than one child
[01:52:31.200 --> 01:52:34.200]  Compulsory education of children, they mean brainwashing
[01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:39.200]  Now listen to this one, encourage increased homosexuality
[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:42.200]  Here's another one, educate for family limitation
[01:52:42.200 --> 01:52:45.200]  Fertility control agents in water supply
[01:52:45.200 --> 01:52:50.200]  And the current White House science star John B. Holdren is on record in multiple books
[01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:53.200]  Calling for this as well, and I got news for you
[01:52:53.200 --> 01:52:55.200]  It's going on now
[01:52:55.200 --> 01:53:00.200]  You are being forcibly drugged with toxic chemicals
[01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:02.200]  Hundreds of them are added to the water supply
[01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:05.200]  Including radioactive isotopes, not just sodium fluoride
[01:53:05.200 --> 01:53:08.200]  That gives you a seven-fold increase in cancer
[01:53:08.200 --> 01:53:13.200]  They have gone absolutely ape over the fact that I'm talking about this
[01:53:13.200 --> 01:53:17.200]  Because it hits at the core of how these scientists are playing God
[01:53:17.200 --> 01:53:19.200]  Okay?
[01:53:19.200 --> 01:53:24.200]  This is not saying that people in the Roman times, some of them weren't gay or whatever
[01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:26.200]  This is not about a moral issue
[01:53:26.200 --> 01:53:32.200]  This is about to reduce population giving men estrogen mimicers
[01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:36.200]  So that they're not attracted to women and so they're less fertile or infertile
[01:53:36.200 --> 01:53:42.200]  But on the other side, it's making girls go into puberty at nine, ten years old
[01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:44.200]  Many of them now at five
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:46.200]  I've seen some articles as young as three
[01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:48.200]  This is all over the Western world
[01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:51.200]  The United States has the highest cancer rates
[01:53:51.200 --> 01:53:55.200]  Especially in women and breast cancer
[01:53:55.200 --> 01:53:59.200]  It basically accelerates the aging process to simplify it
[01:53:59.200 --> 01:54:01.200]  It does a bunch of other horrible things as well
[01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:03.200]  It causes deformities and utero
[01:54:03.200 --> 01:54:05.200]  Causes more abortions
[01:54:05.200 --> 01:54:07.200]  Women to have miscarriages
[01:54:07.200 --> 01:54:10.200]  And that's what this document gets into
[01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:12.200]  It says compulsory abortion
[01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:14.200]  Ground of wedlock pregnancies
[01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:18.200]  Compulsory sterilization of all who have had two children
[01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:19.200]  What do you see in China?
[01:54:19.200 --> 01:54:21.200]  Our government went over there in the seventies
[01:54:21.200 --> 01:54:25.200]  And made a deal with the US government and the UN
[01:54:25.200 --> 01:54:28.200]  To industrialize China and finance them if they do this
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:31.200]  And now I see articles where they have forced abortions
[01:54:31.200 --> 01:54:33.200]  Where they're arresting people or taking their property
[01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:37.200]  If they have more children than the states says they can have
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:39.200]  China is the model of the world
[01:54:39.200 --> 01:54:41.200]  Break out of this matrix
[01:54:41.200 --> 01:54:44.200]  Realized that you live in a controlled society
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:47.200]  And an artificially constructed civilization
[01:54:47.200 --> 01:54:51.200]  Is designed to dehumanize you and strip you of what it is
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:52.200]  To be a human
[01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:55.200]  Taking over our very reproductive process
[01:54:55.200 --> 01:54:58.200]  Chemically altering men and women at an early age
[01:54:58.200 --> 01:54:59.200]  And even in utero
[01:54:59.200 --> 01:55:01.200]  And what happens when I point this out?
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:04.200]  How does the establishment, the mainstream media
[01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:09.200]  These corporate dinosaur mercenaries of propaganda
[01:55:09.200 --> 01:55:12.200]  These prostitutes, how do they respond?
[01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:14.200]  Same what they've done for years
[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:19.200]  I think there were articles in CBS News, ABC News
[01:55:19.200 --> 01:55:22.200]  You name it, attacking myself and Ron Paul
[01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:26.200]  Saying Ron Paul goes on Alex Jones' show
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:29.200]  And Alex Jones says the government's putting chemicals
[01:55:29.200 --> 01:55:32.200]  In your food and water to make you gay
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:35.200]  You see, they know people are reading that
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:37.200]  And so they take all this research and they just turn it into
[01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:39.200]  Alex says they want to make you gay
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:42.200]  And look, Ron Paul goes on their show
[01:55:42.200 --> 01:55:44.200]  And what I've really shown here is this is being done
[01:55:44.200 --> 01:55:47.200]  To reduce fertility, to increase cancer
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:50.200]  And to destroy our normal gender roles
[01:55:50.200 --> 01:55:54.200]  You're taking people's choices to have children away
[01:55:54.200 --> 01:55:59.200]  You're taking people's choices to choose their sexual preference away
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:01.200]  You know, they spend it and say you're born this way
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:03.200]  And certainly there's a different variance of it
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:04.200]  Some of it is natural
[01:56:04.200 --> 01:56:09.200]  But there are artificially adding chemicals that are making rats
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:12.200]  Be confused about their gender, male and female
[01:56:12.200 --> 01:56:13.200]  You're being chemically altered
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:14.200]  Here are the documents
[01:56:14.200 --> 01:56:17.200]  Here's the White House science are calling for adding stuff to the water
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:20.200]  And their answer is, oh Alex doesn't like gay people
[01:56:20.200 --> 01:56:23.200]  That has nothing to do with this
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:27.200]  This is about science and being manipulated by a technocracy
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:28.200]  That's playing God
[01:56:28.200 --> 01:56:31.200]  The Centers for Disease Control has come out
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:34.200]  After public pressure and after scientific pressure
[01:56:34.200 --> 01:56:36.200]  And admitted that what's in the printer ink
[01:56:36.200 --> 01:56:39.200]  And the receipt ink and on the money
[01:56:39.200 --> 01:56:43.200]  And in thousands of products, TV dinners, you name it
[01:56:43.200 --> 01:56:48.200]  Toilet paper that people are touching is an estrogen mimicker
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:51.200]  And was chosen out of thousands of different varieties
[01:56:51.200 --> 01:56:54.200]  To be a chemical in the environment
[01:56:54.200 --> 01:57:00.200]  To reduce fertility and to basically turn men into servile creatures
[01:57:00.200 --> 01:57:02.200]  The globalists just want to subdue the population
[01:57:02.200 --> 01:57:06.200]  So they can engage in chemical and biological warfare against us
[01:57:06.200 --> 01:57:09.200]  Our water, our food, it's all being manipulated
[01:57:09.200 --> 01:57:11.200]  And it's admitted now
[01:57:11.200 --> 01:57:14.200]  That the majority of water supplies in the U.S.
[01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:16.200]  Have high levels of Prozac
[01:57:16.200 --> 01:57:18.200]  High levels of female hormones
[01:57:18.200 --> 01:57:21.200]  High levels of hundreds and hundreds of other chemicals
[01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:22.200]  That are, quote, runoff
[01:57:22.200 --> 01:57:25.200]  The problem is I've seen the major studies
[01:57:25.200 --> 01:57:28.200]  In some cases this stuff is 200, 300, 400 times higher
[01:57:28.200 --> 01:57:30.200]  Than it could be from sewage runoff
[01:57:30.200 --> 01:57:33.200]  It's being added to the water
[01:57:33.200 --> 01:57:36.200]  There's a reason the American people
[01:57:36.200 --> 01:57:38.200]  And the people of Western Europe
[01:57:38.200 --> 01:57:40.200]  Will put up with such incredible tyranny
[01:57:40.200 --> 01:57:44.200]  It's because we've been chemically and biologically manipulated
[01:57:44.200 --> 01:57:46.200]  And you find out what it's doing to people
[01:57:46.200 --> 01:57:48.200]  It is mind-boggling
[01:57:48.200 --> 01:58:01.200]  This is a holocaust that's going on
