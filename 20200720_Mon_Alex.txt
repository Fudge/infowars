[00:00.000 --> 00:20.960]  Ladies and gentlemen, every second, every minute, every hour, every day, every month,
[00:20.960 --> 00:29.680]  every year, every decade, that we do not deal with the Satanic, globalist, New
[00:29.680 --> 00:41.200]  World Order, deep state mounting against us, we get more and more and deeper into
[00:41.200 --> 00:49.280]  trouble. And every day that President Trump allows this same faction to operate
[00:49.280 --> 00:55.520]  in the West, in the United States of America, we are a day closer to the end
[00:56.960 --> 01:06.080]  of America. This is the Alex Jones show on this July 20th, 2020, on Monday.
[01:06.960 --> 01:11.200]  Oh, and Troy are sitting in for Alex today. We'll be hearing from Alex throughout the day,
[01:11.200 --> 01:15.600]  including in the next segment. David Knight is going to be joining me in studio as well in
[01:15.600 --> 01:22.880]  the first hour. And we will be roundtable discussing. Guys, if you want to do a dot cam here,
[01:24.480 --> 01:31.600]  I have so much news. And it's not just one of those things where I just have these stacks
[01:31.600 --> 01:36.240]  of news on the desk. No, I want to cover every single story you see in front of me,
[01:36.240 --> 01:48.320]  because it's all significant. But if you're like me, you wake up every day with the same thing in
[01:48.320 --> 01:56.880]  your head. Is today finally the day that we save America? Is today finally the day we start to see
[01:56.880 --> 02:04.240]  some arrests? Is today finally the day we get some justice? Sadly, every day passes and the answer is
[02:04.240 --> 02:13.200]  no. There's signs we're winning, but we're so far behind. And there's so many signs we're losing.
[02:15.440 --> 02:22.160]  It really makes it tough to measure what we need to do as Americans.
[02:23.200 --> 02:27.680]  So hopefully I'll have time in the third hour to open up the phone lines and ask you just that.
[02:27.680 --> 02:35.760]  But the COVID hoax is just, it's really just unreal at this point.
[02:38.880 --> 02:45.600]  And it tells so many different stories. Who's willing to be a slave? Who is totally brainwashed?
[02:46.240 --> 02:51.280]  Who will gladly put shackles on their own wrists if it means shackling you?
[02:51.280 --> 03:00.240]  Who? The left in America is so deranged and dangerous and out of control
[03:01.280 --> 03:04.880]  and dumbed down and brainwashed. I don't even know how to deal with them anymore.
[03:05.520 --> 03:14.000]  I feel sorry for them. They have been hit with a psychological weapon system that they can't even
[03:14.000 --> 03:25.200]  see or understand. And it just gets worse and worse and worse. Then you've got Kamala Harris,
[03:25.200 --> 03:33.040]  if that's even Kamala Harris. I mean, you tell me folks, Kamala Harris shows up on MSNBC and
[03:33.040 --> 03:38.880]  doesn't even look like Kamala Harris and has little demon eyes. It's like in the movies when they
[03:38.880 --> 03:48.960]  black out the demon's eyes, that was Kamala Harris on MSNBC. Stunning. So what does that mean?
[03:52.320 --> 04:00.320]  People also pointing out her teeth are different. I mean, folks, this is, we are not in Kansas anymore
[04:00.320 --> 04:09.040]  territory. The death of John Lewis, which then brings about the left, the Democrats in Hollywood,
[04:09.040 --> 04:16.800]  to rename the Pettus Bridge in Alabama after John Lewis, the ultimate irony. Edmund Pettus,
[04:17.600 --> 04:27.200]  say it with me, class, was a Democrat. And I predict, because you can still look this up
[04:27.200 --> 04:32.880]  and it's still available on Google and Wikipedia and watch all the headlines last night today.
[04:33.440 --> 04:39.040]  Edmund Pettus, leader of the KKK. Edmund Pettus, racist grand dragon. Edmund Pettus,
[04:39.040 --> 04:49.280]  hate black people. We must rename the bridge. Hey guys, Edmund Pettus was a Democrat, just like all
[04:49.280 --> 04:54.960]  the other KKK wizards and grand dragons and all the marches that Martin Luther King led were against
[04:54.960 --> 05:00.080]  Democrats. The irony is you can cut it with a knife. Another part of the great awakening that's
[05:00.080 --> 05:05.920]  taking place is people that haven't even been religious or Christian now see how evil is out
[05:05.920 --> 05:12.000]  in the open, how hundreds of churches have been burned in Europe and the U.S. Hundreds of Christian
[05:12.000 --> 05:16.880]  icons have been burned, destroyed. Jesuses have had their heads cut off all over the country,
[05:16.880 --> 05:20.880]  all over the Philippines, all over Europe. Virgin Mary's are getting torn down. I mean,
[05:20.880 --> 05:25.840]  crosses are being torn down. It's absolutely out of control, but people now understand
[05:25.840 --> 05:32.000]  that evil was always real. It is spiritual and it was just waiting to make its move,
[05:32.000 --> 05:35.760]  building beneath the surface and now it's emerged. That's why when I ask listeners and
[05:35.760 --> 05:40.160]  viewers for your prayer, I mean it. I'm praying for America. I'm praying for you and I know the
[05:40.160 --> 05:44.560]  power of prayer is real and God hears it. We need to come together and pray for an even greater
[05:44.560 --> 05:50.640]  awakening. Pray for Donald Trump to be protected. Pray for him to win a landslide and pray for
[05:50.640 --> 05:55.360]  the people under deception of the globalist to awaken and join us in liberty and freedom.
[05:55.360 --> 05:57.360]  God bless you all. Please pray for him for us as well.
[06:02.880 --> 06:08.480]  You founded the tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones show.
[06:12.800 --> 06:19.680]  Look at these CNN headlines. Trump insists he's right on viruses. More Americans get sick.
[06:19.680 --> 06:26.640]  U.S. cities hit hard by COVID-19. Way another stay at home order. He's unteachable.
[06:27.280 --> 06:34.240]  Dr. baffled by Trump's Fox News interview. And it just goes through the virus hotspites.
[06:34.240 --> 06:41.120]  The virus is exploding. Trump's virus. I mean, it's all about how Trump did this.
[06:41.760 --> 06:45.600]  And we told you at least five months ago, we figured out exactly what their end game was.
[06:45.600 --> 06:50.400]  They have massive testing here. Have false testing. Even though it's
[06:50.400 --> 06:54.080]  admitted in the fine print that you can have regular coronavirus and the flu in the last decade,
[06:54.080 --> 06:58.080]  it counts as that. They don't care. Put all the people that died skydiving accidents and
[06:58.080 --> 07:03.600]  motorcycle accidents and car wrecks and cancer and pneumonia on the list. But none of that matters
[07:03.600 --> 07:10.720]  because the entire fraudulent media keeps beating this background drum that it's record cases and
[07:10.720 --> 07:17.040]  record deaths, even though the record cases are based on massive, massive testing and massive
[07:17.040 --> 07:23.200]  false positives. And they can only show a few quote spots where the deaths have actually gone back
[07:23.200 --> 07:27.760]  up any and nothing compared to the level that they were three, four months ago. And again,
[07:27.760 --> 07:33.920]  those were almost all in not almost all they were all in blue cities and blue states were again,
[07:33.920 --> 07:39.920]  they could run their frauds and call all deaths, not just some extra deaths COVID-19.
[07:39.920 --> 07:43.840]  So this is the sophisticated brainwashing going on. I mean, at one level, it's very,
[07:43.840 --> 07:48.880]  very simple, but it's sophisticated because it hits from so many different points. And so this
[07:48.880 --> 07:53.360]  is branding against the president, against America. They're now saying, oh, yeah, America's first
[07:53.360 --> 07:58.480]  under Trump, first in coronavirus cases, first in death. And again, none of that's true. So Trump
[07:58.480 --> 08:05.200]  has to directly, not just through surrogates, attack Fauci and the NIH, and the fact that the
[08:05.200 --> 08:09.680]  UN is still commanding it through the WHO. He's pulled out of the WHO. That's good. He said,
[08:09.680 --> 08:14.720]  surrogates exposing Fauci, but he's got to go further. What we're dealing with isn't just organized
[08:14.720 --> 08:21.920]  propaganda. It's organized fraud. It's organized crime. And if Trump simply has some fireside chats
[08:21.920 --> 08:27.920]  with the graphs from the Oval Office and shows people how they said 2.2 million, 2.5 million dead,
[08:28.480 --> 08:34.480]  show how Bill Gates taking him head on funded the British studies and the US studies to claim that,
[08:34.480 --> 08:39.680]  how that was a fraud, how Gates funded a hydroxychloroquine study that had to withdraw total
[08:39.680 --> 08:44.960]  fraud saying it doesn't help people that the media then used. He can then go through all the deaths
[08:44.960 --> 08:49.760]  from gunshot wounds and cancer and heart attacks that are being countered as COVID-19 and explain
[08:50.880 --> 08:55.680]  why he's taken it away from the CDC. That is such a good move to get out of the WHO,
[08:55.680 --> 09:00.800]  that criminal organization run by the globalist and the Chinese communist. It's so good that
[09:00.800 --> 09:05.120]  he's taken power away from the CDC with only a hundred days off from the election. Think about
[09:05.120 --> 09:09.840]  that right now. A hundred and a few change. He's got to go on total offense now with that data.
[09:09.840 --> 09:13.760]  And he's obviously mulling that data. He's going over that data. But how do you even get accurate
[09:13.760 --> 09:18.080]  numbers out of a tissue of lice? That's the problem is you'll never even be able to get
[09:18.080 --> 09:23.760]  a real number out of those fraudulent numbers because in many cases you've had 333 labs in
[09:23.760 --> 09:31.200]  Florida alone all come up 100% positive. Some of the labs tested up to 450 people a day.
[09:31.200 --> 09:36.800]  That of course is premeditated fraud. You do one fraudulent test like that as a felony.
[09:36.800 --> 09:40.240]  Why are all these places doing this on purpose? Because they've been green
[09:40.800 --> 09:45.920]  lit. And you know these talking points that we see manifested every newspaper on every TV show
[09:45.920 --> 09:53.360]  that's establishment are unified. The propaganda, the reports. Here's an example. There's 7.6
[09:53.360 --> 09:57.760]  billion people on the planet. 350 million roughly in the United States. You know they say
[09:57.760 --> 10:02.560]  330. That's probably 350, 360 with the illegal aliens. But they can sit there and cherry pick.
[10:02.560 --> 10:09.280]  Oh, a lesbian member of the church died in Houston making a huge deal. She had trouble
[10:09.280 --> 10:13.680]  breathing when in. They intubated her. She died. Yeah, they intubated her. She was 55 years old
[10:13.680 --> 10:18.160]  or whatever. 56 years old. And so one man dies. It's a tragedy. 10,000 deaths in statistics.
[10:18.160 --> 10:24.080]  Stalin said her deaths important. We're sad for it. But again, they blow that up and then show
[10:24.080 --> 10:28.560]  you every day in every major city. Somebody they say died of COVID. And a lot of times they go
[10:28.560 --> 10:32.720]  check the records and they died of cancer or they died in a car wreck or they died in an automobile
[10:32.720 --> 10:37.040]  accident or they died in a motorcycle accident. I mean, you know the drill. But these newspapers
[10:37.040 --> 10:41.520]  have to get called out. These doctors have to get called out. Why is it certain hospitals and
[10:41.520 --> 10:45.680]  certain cities that have basically all the death? Because that's where they're on board with this
[10:45.680 --> 10:50.640]  fraud. There's also report Rob news working on called the July effect. You notice they've been
[10:50.640 --> 10:55.760]  predicting massive increases of death in July for a few months. Rob do had a weird feeling about that
[10:55.760 --> 11:02.400]  last week. So he search engine, more hospital deaths, July and bingo. Guess where new doctors
[11:02.400 --> 11:08.480]  and new nurses go on every year, the way they cycle out from the medical schools and then the
[11:08.480 --> 11:15.920]  residencies. They come into work in July. It's full bone doctors. And so that's why they're having
[11:15.920 --> 11:20.080]  all these huge medical events right now around the country hotels. That's why they're having all
[11:20.080 --> 11:24.960]  these big conferences. Because before they get pushed in to the hospitals into the clinics,
[11:24.960 --> 11:28.880]  they're giving them one more round of brainwashing. I've got inside sources I was just talking to
[11:28.880 --> 11:32.000]  about this this morning. I'm just gonna leave it at that. I'm trying to get them to come on the show.
[11:33.280 --> 11:36.880]  And so they're going to get patients to come in and say, I'm coughing. I feel like I have
[11:36.880 --> 11:41.360]  weight on my chest. And they're not going to give them hydroxychloric or a zinc or vitamin D or
[11:41.360 --> 11:45.760]  they're not going to give them an inhalable steroids that doctors are saying is 100 success
[11:45.760 --> 11:50.320]  rate. They're going to say, Hey, the manual says put a tube down their throat, the hospital
[11:50.320 --> 11:54.960]  administrators will promote doctors that do that. And pretty soon you'll have some first year doctor
[11:54.960 --> 11:59.920]  who's now one of the managing doctors making twice as much money because they follow the orders of
[11:59.920 --> 12:05.520]  the technocrats. And that's what technocracy is. bureaucrats controlled by powerful financial
[12:05.520 --> 12:12.000]  interest use computer systems to model everything out to manage it to preset it and then that goes
[12:12.000 --> 12:18.880]  out and then doctors and nurses and school teachers and lawyers and police, all of us become robots
[12:18.880 --> 12:25.360]  basically. We have no discretion. We can't make our own decisions. We just repeat and regurgitate
[12:25.360 --> 12:29.760]  what those on top said. And that's what the Chinese Communist social score is all about
[12:29.760 --> 12:35.120]  is monitoring all of us in live time and rewarding us when we're good little slaves and punishing
[12:35.120 --> 12:40.240]  us when we're not. But again, with successful approximation, they begin to squeeze you and
[12:40.240 --> 12:45.440]  get you to the point where it's not just turning your kids over the LGBT movement. It's not just
[12:45.440 --> 12:49.120]  having an abortion. It's not just taking all the vaccines they want to give you forcibly.
[12:49.120 --> 12:54.000]  And so you submit to it pretty soon. It's even more they want more. Now they want you to go out
[12:54.000 --> 12:57.200]  and burn somebody's house down. Now they want you to go out and commit crimes. Now they want
[12:57.200 --> 13:01.920]  you to go attack a federal courthouse. This is multinational corporations directing people
[13:01.920 --> 13:06.640]  that have been programmed on Facebook, selected psychologically, then put into cult programming
[13:06.640 --> 13:12.800]  operations like anti-fund BOM to build this army of mindless idiots that will actually run up on
[13:12.800 --> 13:16.800]  the side of the road and shoot white people in the head only because they're white and it's white
[13:16.800 --> 13:21.280]  people mainly doing it. So this is high tech mind control, ladies and gentlemen, that we're
[13:21.280 --> 13:25.760]  witnessing. And Owen Schreuer and David Knight and others are about to take over. I just wanted
[13:25.760 --> 13:31.440]  to point out here that this COVID hopes must go down because it's designed to never turn the
[13:31.440 --> 13:36.400]  United States loose. Notice we're told the countries that are bad are the UK, the US, and Brazil.
[13:36.960 --> 13:41.680]  Those are the countries that have been 100% submitted to the New World Order. And the technocrats
[13:41.680 --> 13:47.440]  is what they call themselves at Davos. And Gigi Ping has hatched this plan. And they're all open
[13:47.440 --> 13:52.000]  for business. They're telling us we're not open for business and we're the bad guys. And so Trump
[13:52.000 --> 13:57.360]  understands this and is fighting hard. But America's behind the curve because people are just so
[13:57.360 --> 14:02.080]  gullible and continue to buy into mainstream media propaganda. That's why it's beyond critical
[14:02.080 --> 14:05.760]  that all listeners and all viewers spread the word about this live feed, share the article,
[14:05.760 --> 14:09.680]  share the information, and tell everybody word of mouth that this whole thing's a fraud and that
[14:09.680 --> 14:14.480]  wearing the mask is the sign of slavery and the sign of submission to the future lies,
[14:15.440 --> 14:20.800]  the contact tracing, the surveillance, the control, the forced inoculations, all of it,
[14:20.800 --> 14:24.640]  Rumba Bill and Melinda Gates and the Clinton Foundation. Think about that. That's the real
[14:24.640 --> 14:28.800]  world nightmare we're in right now. There's so much more I want to cover. A federal judge
[14:28.800 --> 14:34.320]  that took over the Epstein banking bankruptcy case with billions of hidden money tied into
[14:34.320 --> 14:40.960]  multinational groups, the Mossad MI6 and the Clinton crime syndicate had her son killed and
[14:40.960 --> 14:45.120]  her husband critically injured in New Jersey. Clearly it's connected to the whole Epstein
[14:45.120 --> 14:49.840]  thing. She said she's been getting threats. She just got the case five days ago. We're in a war.
[14:49.840 --> 14:53.680]  We're in a war with globalist forces and American forces and people better decide which
[14:53.680 --> 14:58.240]  side they're on because we are again in critical times. We need to all be thanking God for the
[14:58.240 --> 15:02.960]  awakening but also pregnant others wake up and we turn our civilization society around while
[15:02.960 --> 15:06.720]  there's still time. All right. Back to live feed. Please spread the word. You are the Paul
[15:06.720 --> 15:12.560]  Revere. God bless you all. All right. I'm about to take over with David Knight coming back in five

[15:52.240 --> 16:00.400]  thank you enough back in five minutes with David Knight. Imagine telling someone just a year ago
[16:00.400 --> 16:05.840]  that in the middle of 2020 the Democrats as well as many Republican leaders will be calling for the
[16:05.840 --> 16:15.840]  United Nations WHO edict that all Americans wear masks be a quote federal order and mandate. Totally
[16:15.840 --> 16:22.800]  unconstitutional annihilating states rights. Think about that a woman can kill her baby.
[16:22.800 --> 16:29.760]  We pay for illegal aliens health care but you've got to wear a mask for a virus that killed 20 plus
[16:29.760 --> 16:35.680]  times less than what they said even if you believe the official story. This is about the WHO the
[16:35.680 --> 16:42.160]  globe was testing their power through the media over the federal government to set policy in the
[16:42.160 --> 16:47.440]  United States. This is our punishment for not going with the carbon taxes and the Paris Accord and
[16:47.440 --> 16:54.400]  all of it and by the way they admit that they say now your carbons down one way or another you stupid
[16:54.400 --> 17:02.000]  Americans. The reasons that the globalist launch this planetary lockdown the number one reason is
[17:02.000 --> 17:08.880]  it serves every one of their purposes. We've gone over those purposes many times here on air.
[17:08.880 --> 17:14.160]  The casual society the surveillance system global government medical tyranny forced inoculation
[17:15.040 --> 17:21.360]  but the most important facet is it teaches us that we are obsolete that we are non-essential
[17:22.080 --> 17:29.360]  as we begin to witness automation computers and robots take over the jobs that people once had
[17:29.360 --> 17:36.560]  by design. This isn't like it's some advancement that we just fell into it's been pre-planned
[17:36.560 --> 17:43.920]  organized globally and it's extremely predatory and through governmental actuaries and tax programs
[17:43.920 --> 17:50.640]  and regulations the central banks that control it all are able to pick the winners and the losers
[17:50.640 --> 18:06.720]  and consolidate power. This is the truest form of technocracy fascism. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[18:06.720 --> 18:23.920]  You found it the tip of the spear it is the Alex Jones show with Owen Troyer
[18:25.280 --> 18:32.240]  and David Knight in studio with me of course David Knight hosts the morning show here
[18:32.240 --> 18:39.680]  from 8 to 11 weekdays you can find him live on band.video he's gonna be in studio with me for
[18:39.680 --> 18:48.560]  about the next hour this is the Alex Jones show live from 11 to 3 central and then of course the
[18:48.560 --> 18:53.680]  war room that I'm normally hosting 3 to 6 p.m. weekdays we'll have a fill-in host today and the
[18:53.680 --> 18:59.840]  rest of the week as I'll be sitting in for Alex so I got a ton of news I want to go over with David
[18:59.840 --> 19:08.080]  today and I'm gonna start on this stack of COVID news and there's so many different angles and
[19:08.080 --> 19:13.280]  aspects and and talking points here so we're just gonna dive right into this stack but let's start
[19:13.280 --> 19:18.480]  with this the Washington examiner virus what virus GOP delegates raring to go to Trump's convention
[19:18.480 --> 19:25.680]  you know this is the example of a group of people who want to be free and a group of people who want
[19:25.680 --> 19:32.320]  to be slaves and the average Democrat liberal would gladly put shackles on their own wrists if it
[19:32.320 --> 19:38.080]  meant they got to shackle you too so David clearly there is a divide here as far as who wants to live
[19:38.080 --> 19:42.640]  in fear of the coronavirus or who believes the lies of the coronavirus and it's the same political
[19:42.640 --> 19:48.320]  lines that are being drawn on almost every major issue you have Trump supporters conservatives
[19:48.320 --> 19:53.520]  patriots who don't want to wear a mask don't want to see the economy shut down and at this point
[19:53.520 --> 19:59.760]  just don't buy any of the COVID lies versus the average liberal progressive Democrat who buys and
[19:59.760 --> 20:04.240]  sells all of the lies wants to wear a mask make you wear a mask shut down the economy keep the
[20:04.240 --> 20:09.440]  kids home from school I mean that dichotomy it plays out on every issue but it's the same thing
[20:09.440 --> 20:15.200]  who wants to be free and who would gladly enslave themselves to make you a slave and it's also who
[20:15.200 --> 20:21.120]  is going to just slavishly follow experts as authorities that you don't question and when
[20:21.120 --> 20:26.560]  we look at this it breaks down pretty clearly by demographics and by political party first by
[20:26.560 --> 20:33.520]  demographics in terms of face mask usage those people who said that they will always use it we'll
[20:33.520 --> 20:40.560]  just talk about that figure here 34% of males but 54% of females when you look at political parties
[20:40.560 --> 20:47.120]  Republicans only 24% but Democrats 61% and the independents are somewhere in the middle about
[20:47.120 --> 20:52.160]  I didn't even know those numbers I just saw this in real time oh yeah absolutely but see part of
[20:52.160 --> 20:57.920]  this is that we understand because we do value freedom we understand and have understood from
[20:57.920 --> 21:04.000]  the very beginning that if no matter how bad this disease was you don't fight it by shutting down
[21:04.000 --> 21:07.680]  food production by shutting down medicine by shutting down everything else in your society
[21:07.680 --> 21:14.000]  all you do is add another layer of problems to what was already there and so that's not the right
[21:14.000 --> 21:19.520]  way to do this you don't suspend the Constitution you don't treat everybody as if they had the
[21:19.520 --> 21:22.960]  disease you don't even know if they've got the disease and that's really where the face mask
[21:22.960 --> 21:29.600]  issue is Owen I was talking about that today I said this really is the issue the hill to die on
[21:29.600 --> 21:36.080]  because if we don't stop this they are laying out the psychological framework to tell us what
[21:36.080 --> 21:40.080]  they're telling us with a face mask is you don't wear face mask to protect yourself you wear it
[21:40.080 --> 21:44.960]  to protect other people we've heard that before right with vaccines and the vaccines are what
[21:44.960 --> 21:51.280]  are on the way and so if you're going to embrace this double think about face masks oh well they
[21:51.280 --> 21:56.240]  don't work but you know somehow it protects other people even though I can't be protected by it
[21:56.240 --> 22:00.960]  then you're going to embrace this vaccine nonsense it's going to be pushed that's what this is really
[22:00.960 --> 22:05.120]  about it's about psychological preparation if you look at these experts two or three months ago
[22:05.120 --> 22:08.880]  they were telling us exactly the opposite and then they come back and they try to carve back
[22:08.880 --> 22:14.160]  those lies by saying well we didn't have enough in 95 masks well we had bandanas and we had cloth
[22:14.160 --> 22:20.080]  masks right which are absolutely ineffective as a matter of fact Jonathan Turley talked about
[22:20.080 --> 22:25.680]  today he said if you want to fight these face mask regulations wear an anti-mask you know just
[22:25.680 --> 22:32.000]  wear the picture of the guy going through a Walmart in Tampa and he's got like open holes
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.880]  in it I mean you can see his face through it yeah wear a pair of Victoria's Secret women's lingerie
[22:36.880 --> 22:41.680]  exactly or anything I mean it doesn't as because it's about compliance he said he did that and
[22:41.680 --> 22:47.440]  nobody said anything to him about it I played a clip this morning from a lady who went to a grocery
[22:47.440 --> 22:53.200]  store in Colorado and I mean people were about to they did get physically violent with a one person
[22:53.200 --> 22:58.000]  rammed their cart into her they're yelling and screaming at her they called the police on her
[22:58.000 --> 23:03.120]  because she didn't have a mask I mean is that the one with the big ugly who came up and was yelling
[23:03.120 --> 23:07.840]  right in front of the baby too I think this is another one I don't think there was a baby involved
[23:07.840 --> 23:11.760]  I mean this girl comes up she she does the same thing shoves him with the car is screaming
[23:11.760 --> 23:15.840]  at this lady for not a mask on her mask keeps falling off by the way and there's a baby that
[23:15.840 --> 23:19.600]  she's screaming at basically but you know I don't know if you've seen this let me guys do we have
[23:19.600 --> 23:25.360]  the clip of the the one man in a wheelchair who was getting harassed let's let's play this David I
[23:25.360 --> 23:30.480]  don't know if you've seen this or not a man was going through the grocery store he had a health
[23:30.480 --> 23:35.760]  condition he's actually even in a wheelchair yeah just shows you how sick these people are
[23:35.760 --> 23:38.960]  and he was getting harassed here was the here was the interchange
[23:40.960 --> 23:47.360]  pardon me are you serious yeah I have a medical condition see me in a wheelchair
[23:49.200 --> 23:54.240]  so get away from me this doesn't do you Karen what are you putting shut up I have a medical
[23:54.240 --> 24:03.440]  I have a medical reason you can't tell so again the reason why this video is low is because the
[24:03.440 --> 24:07.600]  guy's in a wheelchair so he comes up he says wear a mask wear a mask the guy in the wheelchair says
[24:07.600 --> 24:11.600]  I have a health condition can't you see the wheelchair he's like I don't care where the mask
[24:11.600 --> 24:17.440]  again these people would gladly put shackles on their own ankles and wrists as long as it
[24:17.440 --> 24:23.040]  meant you got shackled too well you know they did that a similar thing like that uh to a mother
[24:23.040 --> 24:27.280]  who had a child with autism and they said you can't come in the park she said well he can't
[24:27.280 --> 24:32.400]  wear a mask he can't put anything on his face right because he's got autism and and they kicked
[24:32.400 --> 24:37.680]  them out and so she got some people that were on the side of Americans with disabilities act and
[24:37.680 --> 24:43.120]  so forth to come after these park officials who kicked her son with autism out of the park she
[24:43.120 --> 24:48.080]  said first of all he can't breathe with it on secondly nothing a face shield nothing is going
[24:48.080 --> 24:51.040]  to work because you're not going to put anything on his head he doesn't understand he's going to
[24:51.040 --> 24:57.600]  fight it and and and this is the intolerance that is being engendered with people it is obsessive
[24:57.600 --> 25:05.200]  compulsive disorder it is a psychological operation of fear and propaganda and that's what has to
[25:05.200 --> 25:09.120]  be fought these republicans who will kind of halfway say well you know I think it's a good thing to
[25:09.120 --> 25:13.040]  wear a mask and I always wear a mask I'm sorry you saw me on an airplane without a mask and so
[25:13.040 --> 25:20.400]  forth they play easy with that instead of tackling the non-science instead of tackling this authoritarian
[25:20.400 --> 25:26.080]  stasi society that's being created instead of pushing back against Fauci's lies they kind of
[25:26.080 --> 25:31.440]  go along with it and that's going to be fatal to us and by the way berks you remember the old
[25:31.440 --> 25:36.960]  scarf lady she's come out and said she believes the cdc is inflating death numbers by as much as
[25:36.960 --> 25:42.560]  25 percent well that's a low ball it's a lot higher than that but you and notice how she got
[25:42.560 --> 25:46.640]  sidelined you never see her anymore because she realized oh crap they're faking this whole pandemic
[25:46.640 --> 25:53.360]  but but it's so ridiculous in its basic nature literally you'd have two people going around
[25:53.360 --> 25:58.240]  and they can wear a mask and let's say it's a man and a woman on a date and the guy's like hey baby
[25:58.240 --> 26:03.120]  you know let's let's go to bed let's get intimate and she's like oh but what about the covid he says
[26:03.120 --> 26:08.320]  don't worry we'll wear masks okay that's literally what this is like oh i'm gonna wear a mask while
[26:08.320 --> 26:11.840]  i'm having sex with you and that'll stop covid it's like these these officers same thing happened
[26:11.840 --> 26:16.480]  to me david these officers come up if you're not wearing a mask and they arrest you and what are
[26:16.480 --> 26:20.480]  they doing they're putting their hands all over you they're touching your hands they're touching
[26:20.480 --> 26:25.840]  your face they're groping you rubbing up on you oh but the mask though the mask is going to stop
[26:25.840 --> 26:29.920]  the covid even though it gets through the mask and they're touching you and spitting on you
[26:29.920 --> 26:34.720]  and everything it's just oh yeah and fouchy also says you know continue to use grinder and tinder
[26:34.720 --> 26:38.800]  that's because he's active on there he's looking for a little action on the side uh so fouchy is
[26:38.800 --> 26:42.880]  still live on tinder if you want to hit him up he can give you some good covid all right well
[26:42.880 --> 26:47.680]  we'll get into more of this when we come back they don't want the kids back in the classroom folks
[26:47.680 --> 26:52.320]  parents are going to be pissed about this and liberal teachers are saying i still want to be paid
[26:52.320 --> 26:58.000]  but i'm not going to teach your kid i know what we'll do to make them conform to our cult we'll
[26:58.000 --> 27:02.160]  all tell them to wear masks so they're going to die and then we'll release the pressure for a while
[27:02.160 --> 27:05.760]  and bring it back and squeeze it harder and release it again and we'll be the virtuous
[27:05.760 --> 27:12.800]  second ones will be the angels even though our lord and master bill gates helped find the whole covid-19 oh
[27:12.800 --> 27:21.040]  no don't seduce me that's right that's the code word for bill gates this operation he carries out
[27:21.040 --> 27:28.560]  with his good little buddy dr fouchy in the surgeon cult as you know for girls there's five
[27:28.560 --> 27:34.000]  different types of villains they secretly desire in the romance novels one of them is the vampire
[27:34.000 --> 27:40.640]  the werewolf the billionaire and and who else oh that's right there's the surgeon and then there's
[27:40.640 --> 27:46.400]  one other one and it's so much fun to be ruled over by these psychotic psychopaths it's so good
[27:46.400 --> 27:52.880]  to know that there are masters and are coming to rape us with their inoculations psychopaths are so
[27:52.880 --> 28:04.240]  high oh yeah
[28:04.240 --> 28:06.240]  where the hell did this water come from
[28:07.360 --> 28:12.640]  where did it come from where did it come from where did it come from where did it come from

[29:05.360 --> 29:11.120]  and then died and as soon as i saw her face as soon as i saw the report i said watch it'll be
[29:11.120 --> 29:17.200]  innovation we know what's going to happen it's a blue city the same story yet again and they say
[29:17.200 --> 29:23.280]  her heart gave out if you put somebody on a breathing tube a covet 19 is a death sentence
[29:23.280 --> 29:27.600]  it's on record when everyone you know before they go to the hospital and get killed why are almost
[29:27.600 --> 29:32.880]  all the deaths happening in blue cities in blue states it's because they intubate them putting
[29:32.880 --> 29:38.880]  a tube in their lungs and covet 19 is causing an autoimmune response and if you do that with oxygen
[29:38.880 --> 29:44.400]  the doctors are on records saying it will kill you but all these doctors in blue cities and
[29:44.400 --> 29:50.800]  blue states follow their orders and the minute i saw this report today i knew what i would be reading
[29:50.800 --> 29:53.680]  don't end up like vicki gibbs or everyone
[29:53.680 --> 30:05.760]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[30:05.760 --> 30:21.920]  you found it the tip of the spear it is the alex jones show with olyn shroyer
[30:24.160 --> 30:27.520]  you know we're talking during the break myself and david night
[30:29.120 --> 30:33.680]  about this nonsense you know i got all this news and i'm gonna get to it just again a couple
[30:33.680 --> 30:38.400]  quick headlines here new york times has a piece from a teacher i won't return to the classroom
[30:38.400 --> 30:43.760]  and you shouldn't ask me to well they don't ask me to pay taxes how about that how about how about
[30:43.760 --> 30:49.760]  you take all the taxes that fund your your wage and you can shove them up your derriere because if
[30:49.760 --> 30:53.280]  you're not in the classroom we're not paying them of course homeschool parents don't care about that
[30:53.280 --> 30:58.480]  anyway but it's just a joke i'm not gonna do my job but still pay me you know it's a fake pandemic
[30:58.480 --> 31:04.240]  you lazy bums fired up and ready to go dnc milwaukee convention continues to shrink
[31:04.240 --> 31:08.240]  latest prediction of only 350 attendees i'm i'm only covering this because i'm telling you they're
[31:08.240 --> 31:12.480]  gonna cancel it they're gonna cancel every presidential debate they can't have biden on a stage with
[31:12.480 --> 31:16.880]  trump they'll blame covid for all of it plus they know the bernie sanders supporters are gonna riot
[31:16.880 --> 31:20.960]  and burn milwaukee to the ground so they don't want that to happen in their name but you know
[31:20.960 --> 31:25.360]  david i got all this other news how the democrats killed all the old people in nursing homes now
[31:25.360 --> 31:30.640]  they're claiming dogs have coronavirus need to be put down i mean what a lie that is well found
[31:30.640 --> 31:35.200]  you think that new york did it right you know i saw that oh yeah with all the dead in new york
[31:35.200 --> 31:38.720]  like 10 times worse than any other state but you know what david okay here's what i want to do
[31:38.720 --> 31:42.320]  they're the model you know away from all the numbers and news this is really what it's about
[31:42.320 --> 31:48.400]  what we were talking about in the break that the average american the average human is so i don't
[31:48.400 --> 31:53.520]  even know what it is brainwashed or enslaved or whatever where it's like you walk into a restaurant
[31:53.520 --> 31:59.120]  okay you can't eat i can't shove a burrito into my mouth with a mask on okay it's ridiculous i can't
[31:59.120 --> 32:03.200]  drink a soda pop if i have a mask on so okay you're sitting in the restaurant you're drinking you're
[32:03.200 --> 32:09.040]  eating you don't have a mask on oh but if you walk in five feet to sit at your table and get to the
[32:09.040 --> 32:13.440]  water oh no no you gotta have a mask on for that i can't have you walking in here without a mask
[32:13.440 --> 32:20.160]  it's like sir sir everyone in here is not wearing a mask people are touching my food okay like i'm
[32:20.160 --> 32:25.280]  not worried about getting sick no no no you have to wear a mask five feet from that door to that table
[32:25.280 --> 32:30.560]  before you sit down and drink your water you have to wear the mask but aside from the lunatic fringe
[32:31.280 --> 32:37.040]  theory that that would stop anything again the mask doesn't stop anything i mean it just levels
[32:37.040 --> 32:41.600]  and layers of total nonsense and they just go with it but it's just like david what happened
[32:41.600 --> 32:46.720]  to basic common sense what happened to just humanity where someone just thinks and says
[32:46.720 --> 32:51.760]  huh you're right wearing a mask for five feet to sit down at the table doesn't make any sense
[32:51.760 --> 32:56.320]  they just go along with it well that's what we're talking about uh my wife and i going to a small
[32:56.880 --> 33:03.120]  restaurant locally i thought i would help them out and uh again they want to enforce that rule
[33:03.760 --> 33:08.080]  and they were adamant about it and it's like okay fine you know we won't be here and you won't
[33:08.080 --> 33:12.400]  be here either yeah you're not gonna be here because well they don't realize and i talked
[33:12.400 --> 33:17.200]  about this on on the morning show i said you know that the quote from lennon that the capitalist will
[33:17.200 --> 33:23.280]  sell the rope that is used to hang them and what we're seeing now is that even small business
[33:23.280 --> 33:28.720]  is selling the regulations that are going to be used to hang them she doesn't realize that she's
[33:28.720 --> 33:34.800]  propagating the fear and the insanity behind all of this stuff and it's the fear that is going to
[33:34.800 --> 33:38.800]  kill her business because people are going to be afraid to go there you know at this point like
[33:38.800 --> 33:42.960]  i said we walked in why would you want to go we had to have a mask to walk the five feet to the
[33:42.960 --> 33:47.520]  table then i could take it off i could order i could wait for my food eat my food wait for the
[33:47.520 --> 33:52.000]  bill and so forth none of that would have been a problem but it's a principle that i have to have
[33:52.000 --> 33:56.880]  the mask before i get service why would anybody want to go deal with that yeah that's my thing we
[33:56.880 --> 34:00.560]  were like i don't even go out to have dinner anymore i don't even it's like sucks it's like you
[34:00.560 --> 34:05.440]  can't even leave your house just a reminder that you're a slave well it's being pushed by the national
[34:05.440 --> 34:10.320]  retail federation a lot of people got a lot of attention when walmart did it because you know
[34:10.320 --> 34:15.840]  walmart is saying we're 65 percent of their stores are there there aren't any government
[34:15.840 --> 34:20.320]  regulations about wearing masks but walmart is going to go further they're going to force you
[34:20.320 --> 34:25.760]  to wear a mask to go inside their chinese store and then they're going to have black shirts because
[34:25.760 --> 34:31.120]  the brown shirts a little bit too obvious right to harass you yeah but i mean at disney world they've
[34:31.120 --> 34:35.440]  got the stormtroopers that are harassing people so yeah at least i've got a sense of humor about it
[34:35.440 --> 34:42.320]  right by the way i would imagine i would imagine i have never i've never masked up i've continued
[34:42.320 --> 34:46.960]  to go out i was going to the gym before they made me mask up sharing equipment i was playing basketball
[34:46.960 --> 34:51.840]  three nights a week with sweaty guys rubbing up you know i mean it's like i mean this is a joke
[34:51.840 --> 34:56.320]  i've never gotten sick all my friends at the gym never gotten sick all the people here at info
[34:56.320 --> 35:00.560]  wars have never gotten sick have you ever gotten sick no i mean it's a total joke again but it's
[35:00.560 --> 35:06.480]  basic common sense david it's like we've crossed this weird threshold where the actual physical
[35:06.480 --> 35:11.200]  step we take the physical air we breathe the physical things that we see in the third dimension
[35:11.200 --> 35:16.080]  like the actual life we're experiencing doesn't even matter oh it's twilight zone it doesn't even
[35:16.080 --> 35:20.240]  weigh into people's thoughts anymore the only thing they weigh is what they see on tv what they
[35:20.240 --> 35:25.520]  hear from the voices of authority what they're actually living and experiencing has zero value
[35:25.520 --> 35:30.240]  anymore how did we get here i i feel like i'm in the twilight zone i mean the only it's like i'm in
[35:30.240 --> 35:34.720]  some kind of virtual reality twilight zone except it's in color instead of black and white
[35:34.720 --> 35:40.080]  and i can't get out yeah i can't change the channel it's like it's crazy it's infuriating
[35:40.080 --> 35:45.680]  but you know i i was sick at the end of the year uh this last year and i think it picked it up
[35:45.680 --> 35:49.680]  when my wife and i went on a cruise and we traveled by plane and we sat in the airport and we talked
[35:49.680 --> 35:53.440]  for about an hour the flight was delayed we talked about an hour the guy who'd just come back from
[35:53.440 --> 35:59.120]  china it could have been covid 19 it could have been the flu but here's the thing to put on all
[35:59.120 --> 36:04.880]  of these mask regulations and all the rest of this stuff uh as one person pointed out it's kind of
[36:04.880 --> 36:11.280]  like sounding off the air raid alarm at pearl harbor three months after the japanese attack
[36:11.280 --> 36:17.520]  it's at it's that ridiculous this is a day late and a dollar short if it was ever effective but
[36:17.520 --> 36:22.640]  it's not effective these same people who told us not to wear this and they were telling us the truth
[36:22.640 --> 36:26.640]  it's not going to do you any good it's actually going to make it harder for you to breathe uh
[36:26.640 --> 36:30.960]  they were telling us the truth then now they're lying to us and it's for political purposes this
[36:30.960 --> 36:36.400]  is political and it is psychological and it's not medical it is not scientific they're yelling fire
[36:36.400 --> 36:41.280]  in a theater which is illegal by the way that's exactly what the media is doing and it's really
[36:41.280 --> 36:47.840]  what it comes down to it's just the media lies the media hoaxes let me give you some fact continue
[36:47.840 --> 36:52.880]  this i saw tweeted out by dr david samadi he said this is a wonderful graphic from the state of
[36:52.880 --> 36:59.040]  ohio while covet 19 is incredibly serious virus look at it in perspective and what they did was
[36:59.040 --> 37:04.480]  they showed the number of people number of tests given a million tests and he does this graphically
[37:04.480 --> 37:10.640]  and there you go good uh he's got it graphically a million tests and they had 69 000 people positive
[37:10.640 --> 37:17.200]  that's seven percent so 93 did not test positive seven percent tested positive of that they had
[37:17.200 --> 37:24.400]  3000 deaths according to the cdc that would give you a case fatality rate of 0.3 percent now if you
[37:24.400 --> 37:30.000]  look at the texas department of public health last week or two weeks ago when they came out and said
[37:30.000 --> 37:35.600]  well you're gonna have we've got the statewide mask regulation from abit and then he had the
[37:35.600 --> 37:39.840]  state uh flunky who was head of the health department coming out saying you better start
[37:39.840 --> 37:43.840]  wearing masks inside your own home we're not going to enforce that just yet but you better
[37:43.840 --> 37:48.880]  start wearing it inside your home at the same time that was coming out the texas department
[37:48.880 --> 37:54.160]  of health released numbers for the this year and the previous two-year flu seasons previous two years
[37:54.160 --> 38:00.560]  one year it was 0.3 percent the other year it was 0.4 percent this year with covet 19 is 0.1
[38:00.560 --> 38:05.200]  percent so we're one third to one quarter of what we've seen in the past and yet we've got the entire
[38:05.200 --> 38:11.280]  economy locked down we've got these guys demanding that we wear masks inside our own homes at the
[38:11.280 --> 38:17.200]  very republicans at the very minimum and this is at the very minimum you have a criminal conspiracy
[38:17.840 --> 38:22.720]  brought on by the medical industry to sell vaccines this is at the minimum now this is the
[38:22.720 --> 38:26.400]  minimum level i mean really this is maximum world enslavement stuff we're talking about here but at
[38:26.400 --> 38:31.840]  the minimum level that the average person should be able to understand this is a racketeering uh
[38:31.840 --> 38:39.280]  criminal manipulation by the cdc by the who and the people that are ready to profit like Fauci and
[38:39.280 --> 38:43.840]  gates and all their little underlings they've rebranded the flu david that's what they've done
[38:43.840 --> 38:49.120]  they released a weapon out of china to get people sick specifically in that region when it came out
[38:49.120 --> 38:53.120]  it's probably really deadly and then it mutated pretty fast and became basically like an average
[38:53.120 --> 38:57.760]  flu bug i mean which is a crime against humanity in and of itself that should be addressed but we
[38:57.760 --> 39:05.440]  can't even get the basic science so it's like okay you rebranded the flu as covet 19 coronavirus so
[39:05.440 --> 39:12.560]  that you could sell vaccines to six billion people that's what they've done david and now they're
[39:12.560 --> 39:17.520]  gearing up to do it and let's not forget it's not just the chinese it goes back to Fauci and the
[39:17.520 --> 39:23.360]  nih these people are you genesis not just because they partner with gates and they push vaccines
[39:23.360 --> 39:29.840]  but when francis collins who's head of the nih he's uh collin he's uh Fauci's boss collins had
[39:29.840 --> 39:34.240]  been part of the human genome project and when he went to the nih the beginning the first thing he
[39:34.240 --> 39:39.840]  did was a human connectome project because he is a transhumanist he thinks that he's going to be able
[39:39.840 --> 39:44.880]  to transfer his mind into a robot machine you know into a mechanical machine and live forever
[39:44.880 --> 39:50.240]  that's what these people are focused on and what Fauci was doing with all this uh chinese stuff he was
[39:50.880 --> 39:56.240]  they were uh called on the carpet we were about fellows the bad news is western governments have
[39:56.240 --> 40:02.320]  totally let multinational big tech bring in communist chinese style total net surveillance
[40:02.320 --> 40:07.680]  censorship with ai the good news is they had to do that to carry out this world government
[40:07.680 --> 40:15.440]  covet takeover this planetary corporate reset the covet covers for because the truth is powerful
[40:15.440 --> 40:20.880]  and will defeat them and will smash them and the good news is there's still sites like band
[40:20.880 --> 40:28.240]  dot video news wars dot com info wars dot com paul watson sites summit dot news and a lot of other
[40:28.240 --> 40:34.480]  great sites that are getting massive traffic thanks to you and your word of mouth that is king
[40:34.480 --> 40:41.040]  that is queen that is the master of our own destinies ladies and gentlemen there is a war
[40:41.040 --> 40:47.680]  on reality a war on civilization a war on our health a war on our economy but being aware of it
[40:47.680 --> 40:53.200]  and standing up to it and speaking out against it will defeat it so take action or be slaves
[40:53.200 --> 41:01.440]  we are selling more privacy pockets a day that we were previously selling in a month
[41:01.440 --> 41:05.360]  because of the clinton foundation running the contact tracing and admittedly with google

[43:10.640 --> 43:18.400]  reality it's building a post human world so that you can be made obsolete domesticated dumbed down
[43:18.400 --> 43:28.080]  drugged distracted atomized and then slowly killed this is the brave new world it's the post human
[43:28.080 --> 43:34.080]  world it's the dreaming of the post human world the wired magazine in the wall street journal
[43:34.080 --> 43:38.720]  all tell us about it oh now they tell us our smartphones don't just track or remove
[43:38.720 --> 43:44.720]  they're monitoring our psychology and sending it back to a corporate database globally you see
[43:45.280 --> 43:50.960]  the bear trap closed on our leg now and the vampire walked out of the bushes and is explaining
[43:50.960 --> 44:10.480]  us how we're slowly gonna bleed us and destroy us you're listening to the alex jones show
[44:14.080 --> 44:15.840]  you know david here's how my mind works
[44:15.840 --> 44:23.920]  works on works on coffee well yeah it does work on the coffee from info wars
[44:23.920 --> 44:26.560]  store dot com i was taking a drink of coffee thank you for filling that dead air
[44:27.840 --> 44:32.480]  no my mind works like this david um when i look at an issue
[44:34.160 --> 44:40.320]  i try to bring it down to the lowest common denominator logic and reasoning and so when i
[44:40.320 --> 44:45.680]  see mayors and governors and politicians and all these people telling me i have to wear a mask
[44:45.680 --> 44:50.000]  it's a mandate i need to be afraid of coveted well i just bring it down to lowest common
[44:50.000 --> 44:55.120]  denominator logic either you're mentally retarded and you actually believe that i'm not trying to
[44:55.120 --> 45:00.000]  be insensitive i mean you you literally have a mental illness and you can't read you can't write
[45:00.000 --> 45:04.960]  you can't think and so you really think the mask is stopping anything when it's scientifically
[45:04.960 --> 45:11.360]  proven not to so you're you're you're literally like a mongoloid or you're a foreign operative
[45:11.360 --> 45:16.240]  you're some sort of operative that's out to get me you're you're a paid spokesperson you're bought
[45:16.240 --> 45:22.080]  and paid for you're out to get me you're trying to attack me by coming after logic and reasoning so
[45:22.080 --> 45:27.120]  that's just like low and lowest common denominator when i see adler and nurenberg these are local
[45:27.120 --> 45:33.280]  mayors san antonio and austin and politicians saying you have to wear a mask and it doesn't stop
[45:33.280 --> 45:38.480]  covet doesn't stop anything you can't make me wear a mask it's just lowest common denominator
[45:38.480 --> 45:44.960]  you're either mentally ill to actually believe that or you're paid to get me you're out to get me
[45:44.960 --> 45:51.760]  you are my enemy and you chose that ground not me um i mean is that not just the lowest common
[45:51.760 --> 45:57.120]  denominator of logic when dealing with these things i think these people realize that this is a
[45:57.120 --> 46:04.000]  a a path to power and a path to dependency they realize that as i've been talking about from
[46:04.000 --> 46:10.000]  the very beginning immunity passports and they've been talking about this way before the pandemic
[46:10.000 --> 46:15.200]  began i mean this is going back a long way i mean you got bill gates back and announcing the
[46:15.200 --> 46:20.640]  completion of his tattoo id thing and and again you know he had his program id 2020 it's coming
[46:20.640 --> 46:28.080]  in right on time now they've been looking at this as a way to track people to control people and uh
[46:28.080 --> 46:34.640]  this has become the perfect path for all of this but you know this is part of really the un 2030
[46:34.640 --> 46:40.160]  agenda and there's a globalism that's in play here they're forcing cuddling us if you will
[46:40.880 --> 46:47.360]  into uh cyberspace and if you look at the future of work the future of work is working online well
[46:47.360 --> 46:52.800]  i'm gonna need to have 5g so get me my 5g i need to have that to work online and it also on keeps
[46:52.800 --> 47:00.320]  them from having to lobby and pay off republicans and democrats in congress for their h1b visas
[47:00.320 --> 47:06.160]  anybody can work anywhere uh so you can have your cheap labor in uh india or wherever you want it
[47:06.160 --> 47:10.640]  working online and they don't even have to worry about physically moving the people in for that
[47:10.640 --> 47:16.480]  type of thing and they can control everybody on cyberspace if they move you into cyberspace they
[47:16.480 --> 47:21.920]  already control that area and uh i've talked about the smart cities that were part of the
[47:21.920 --> 47:27.680]  un 2030 agenda how google was setting that up in toronto and other places yet this allows them to
[47:27.680 --> 47:32.960]  essentially even transcend that because once they kettle everybody into cyberspace and you can't
[47:32.960 --> 47:36.720]  get an education unless you're in cyberspace you can't work unless you're in cyberspace they can
[47:36.720 --> 47:41.520]  watch and control everything that you do and it allows them to basically open up and create a
[47:41.520 --> 47:46.960]  borderless global community right there from the very beginning and i think that's a big part of
[47:46.960 --> 47:53.280]  this but the immunity passport your mask right now is like your immunity badge but the real immunity
[47:53.280 --> 47:59.040]  badge is in the mail and it's being prepared right now by the us military who are preparing the
[47:59.040 --> 48:03.040]  vaccines are manufacturing these things they haven't even tested them but they're going to rush them
[48:03.040 --> 48:09.360]  out and the news reports i played one today from mbc news oh and and it was all about well
[48:09.360 --> 48:13.520]  we're not sure we can get one for everybody quickly enough and so uh you really want to make sure
[48:13.520 --> 48:16.800]  you've got this and we're doing the best we can to get everything out there at everybody and we're
[48:16.800 --> 48:21.200]  rushing rushing rushing right though the mask is the whole danger that's it the mask is the hold
[48:21.200 --> 48:25.040]  over it's the placeholder yeah right before the vaccine and then you'll have to have your little
[48:25.040 --> 48:29.600]  medical card but but here's here's here's the truth folks see sometimes these democrats whether
[48:29.600 --> 48:33.600]  winningly or unwittingly tell you the truth about what they're actually thinking and what they're
[48:33.600 --> 48:39.920]  actually doing here was one of those moments stockton california mayor michael tubs first of all
[48:40.800 --> 48:48.240]  mr tubs we're sick of giving you money in california okay they get 27 million dollars
[48:48.240 --> 48:52.800]  she says it's not enough because people are going broke well you're the one shutting down the economy
[48:52.800 --> 48:59.600]  but that's not even what i'm getting to i'm getting off topic see if you pick up on the incredible
[48:59.600 --> 49:08.560]  admission he makes in this 42nd clip see if you pick up on what he says here stockton is set to
[49:08.560 --> 49:15.440]  receive something like 27 million dollars from the cares act to help in covid 19 relief support
[49:15.440 --> 49:20.800]  but can you tell me a little bit about if that's enough money and what that means for how you can
[49:20.800 --> 49:29.040]  help small businesses recover mayor tubs it's a lot more than zero dollars but it's definitely not
[49:29.040 --> 49:34.240]  enough money just giving the need the staggering numbers of unemployment and they understand that
[49:34.240 --> 49:39.200]  this pandemic won't be over in a month or three months or in five months when the money has to be
[49:39.200 --> 49:45.120]  spent like the impacts and and some of the um modifications well i did hear that david here
[49:45.120 --> 49:50.080]  guys pause it just rewind at 15 seconds did did you i want the audience to pick up on this before i
[49:50.080 --> 49:55.040]  tell you what he just said there i want you to hear it and think about what he just said for yourself
[49:55.040 --> 49:59.920]  listen closely listen to what he just said listen to what he really just admitted play it again
[50:01.520 --> 50:06.400]  it's a lot more than zero dollars but it's definitely not enough money is giving the need
[50:06.400 --> 50:11.200]  the staggering numbers of unemployment and they understand that this pandemic won't be over in
[50:11.200 --> 50:16.480]  a month or three months or in five months when the money has to be spent at the impact wow okay hold
[50:16.480 --> 50:23.600]  on wow so he's now a fortune teller he's now a psychic he can now tell us the future david this
[50:23.600 --> 50:28.800]  this tubs who i doubt has any background in any sort of science or medicine at all i'd be shocked
[50:28.800 --> 50:34.000]  if he has any impressive background and he says the pandemic oh he knows obama that's how he get
[50:34.000 --> 50:38.400]  into okay now it all makes sense he probably hangs out at obama's gay parties too uh i'm
[50:38.400 --> 50:43.920]  sorry to get graphic folks obama's obama's gay okay it's a big joke uh but anyway that guy's
[50:43.920 --> 50:47.280]  probably gay with him not even kidding same with john legend and the rest but i'll digress david
[50:47.280 --> 50:52.400]  i'm sorry but it's just true he says oh the pandemic won't be over in a month or three months
[50:52.400 --> 50:58.720]  or five well how do you know that because they're running it it's a hoax it's a hoax they're running
[50:58.720 --> 51:05.520]  the hoax he's telling you this pandemic is never going to end we're running it we're making you
[51:05.520 --> 51:10.320]  slaves with it but it's even worse than that too nuisance said you know when he put this lock down
[51:10.320 --> 51:15.360]  and said nobody shut down all the businesses shut down the churches again and he doesn't have any
[51:15.360 --> 51:19.280]  time date on this they've been telling us well another month another two months or whatever
[51:19.280 --> 51:23.280]  now it's just no date at all and fouchy has said this as well he says it's not gonna end till we
[51:23.280 --> 51:27.680]  got the vaccine 15 years to slow the spread yeah it's not gonna end till we get the vaccine
[51:27.680 --> 51:35.680]  fouchy knew in 2005 fouchy's organization ran tests on hydroxychloroquine said it was effective
[51:35.680 --> 51:41.440]  for the sars obama took hydroxychloroquine exactly they said it was effective as both
[51:41.440 --> 51:44.880]  treatment and preventative and so he was lying about that from the very beginning but he's been
[51:44.880 --> 51:48.320]  telling us the truth that it's not going to end until quote we get the vaccine but now they say
[51:48.320 --> 51:52.160]  well the vaccine's not going to be completely effective we're gonna have to keep taking it
[51:52.160 --> 51:57.040]  all the time i'll tell you something else about this guy in stockton stockton has declared bankruptcy
[51:57.040 --> 52:01.600]  one of the few municipalities in the u.s that has declared bankruptcy and stockton in spite of the
[52:01.600 --> 52:07.040]  fact that they'd already declared bankruptcy and worry bankrupt financially as well as morally
[52:07.040 --> 52:11.680]  they decided that they would go with universal basic income and that's exactly what we've got
[52:11.680 --> 52:20.160]  we've got the craziest policies of aoc and the stockton mayor and this is full on their dad
[52:20.160 --> 52:25.760]  commies and this is what our our you know our our federal government has given us as they have
[52:25.760 --> 52:31.440]  forced people out of work shut down businesses they've now put us on universal basic income see and
[52:31.440 --> 52:36.320]  that's the key right there and you know i'm look i'm not that i'm 31 okay but it's like i even i'm
[52:36.320 --> 52:40.400]  getting this old back in the good old days it's like you know what what happened pretty fast what
[52:40.400 --> 52:45.360]  happened to the good old days where you smashed a commies face it in this country you saw a commie
[52:45.360 --> 52:50.800]  on the street corner you kicked his commie ass i'm sick of this crap man but that's what it is david
[52:50.800 --> 52:58.640]  they say oh it's more than zero but 27 million isn't enough for my people okay so let me get
[52:58.640 --> 53:05.120]  the straight you shut down the economy you killed the jobs market you made all the people go broke
[53:05.120 --> 53:10.800]  you made the financial ruin you did all of that as the mayor you did all of that as a politician
[53:10.800 --> 53:18.240]  and then you want us to pay the bill they i mean david it's so infuriating it's that's why it's so
[53:18.240 --> 53:21.600]  difficult to come on here and talk about because i'm just gonna be yelling around these people are
[53:21.600 --> 53:27.760]  damn commies fouchy belongs in jail i just why is america putting up with this i don't get it
[53:27.760 --> 53:32.080]  why is trump putting up with it i don't understand because it's not even in his best interest even
[53:32.080 --> 53:37.600]  from an electoral standpoint they know that it's about the economy and right now you know they want
[53:37.600 --> 53:41.840]  power they want more power so they want to make sure that they shut down the economy they will
[53:41.840 --> 53:47.120]  destroy america in order to get power over america they've done it to the black community they've done
[53:47.120 --> 53:51.440]  it to the american indians they're doing it to the white middle class now they're doing it to
[53:51.440 --> 53:56.400]  everybody because they don't care what they do to you as long as they wind up the ones on top with
[53:56.400 --> 54:01.280]  power and so that's what they're doing they've got their knee on the throat of america and they're
[54:01.280 --> 54:04.880]  not going to take it off and i can't breathe and that's what we need to call ourselves instead of
[54:04.880 --> 54:09.200]  anti-maskers we need to call ourselves the i can't breathe movement because uh that's what
[54:09.200 --> 54:13.360]  they're trying to do they're trying to kill us and they will do it for power yeah the democrats
[54:13.360 --> 54:18.240]  are politically george floiding us right now yeah the democrats are george floiding us right now
[54:18.240 --> 54:23.840]  they got they are the officer with the knee on our neck except here's the thing we're not fighting
[54:23.840 --> 54:28.160]  that's right that's the pathetic thing we're not even fighting back we're just letting them do it
[54:28.160 --> 54:32.320]  and they're just claiming it's for our best interest as they strangle us it's just it's just
[54:32.320 --> 54:37.600]  unbelievable you know meanwhile governor Cuomo gets away with mass murder of 10 000 people but you
[54:37.600 --> 54:42.640]  know he doesn't belong behind bars he's a hero says the new york times and fouchy they both belong
[54:42.640 --> 54:49.440]  behind bars it's christmas in july we ran the sale last year it was very very popular and so i am
[54:49.440 --> 54:55.040]  now announcing that we are running it again in the year 2020 a very important election year and we
[54:55.040 --> 55:01.600]  have some fabulous new shirts that i think should be the campaign shirt of 2020 it's the american eagle
[55:01.600 --> 55:07.440]  boldly spreading its wings sitting at top of betsy ross flag and the shirts are on sale right now
[55:07.440 --> 55:13.520]  and in full or store dot com i got the idea of the trump campaign having a similar shirt media
[55:13.520 --> 55:18.160]  called nazi which of course it isn't and since it's so triggering to the leftist and globalist well
[55:18.160 --> 55:22.960]  we're gonna make sure there's even more of these on the streets to spread the word and exercise
[55:22.960 --> 55:27.760]  our first amendment in the face of these times we also have store live free shipping double
[55:27.760 --> 55:32.960]  patriot points so whatever great item it is that you want store live free shipping double patriot
[55:32.960 --> 55:38.080]  points on your next order and at least 50 percent off across the board now i'm gonna have to get
[55:38.080 --> 55:41.520]  this sale very very soon because all these products are about to sell out just take advantage of it
[55:41.520 --> 55:49.760]  right now at four store dot com americans have had freedom for so long and most americans were born
[55:49.760 --> 55:54.960]  into such docile times compared to the rest of history that we really have a blind spot for
[55:54.960 --> 56:01.040]  tyranny we don't appreciate the american way truth justice due process the right to self defense
[56:01.040 --> 56:05.360]  private property because we've had it so long and we just think that's how the rest of the world is
[56:05.360 --> 56:10.800]  ladies and gentlemen the renaissance the social contract that's 500 years old to try to build
[56:10.800 --> 56:15.840]  up humanity and try to believe in humanity and try to empower the weak as well as the strong
[56:15.840 --> 56:20.880]  is something the west invented and that's what made our modern world that's now been hijacked by
[56:20.880 --> 56:25.680]  the technocrats by the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth and we need to be
[56:25.680 --> 56:32.640]  cold and dumb down and put into subgroups that the elites dominate manipulate and command even
[56:32.640 --> 56:39.280]  lucky enough to stay alive and that's what covet nineteen is a global un revolution against free
[56:39.280 --> 56:43.600]  humanity against your family against prosperity and against your future if you don't stand up and fight
[56:43.600 --> 56:50.480]  you deserve what you get you're listening to the alex jones show
[56:59.360 --> 57:02.480]  i'm just so frustrated and sick of it i want to talk over my own liner here
[57:02.480 --> 57:11.120]  here i'll enjoy our david night in studio i i just you know here here's the only because i
[57:12.320 --> 57:17.920]  you asked the question what is trump doing i don't know letting the globalist dig his grave
[57:17.920 --> 57:23.760]  for him while he watches watching them dig the grave of america but we can go back and forth on
[57:23.760 --> 57:29.520]  that issue all day but it's it's it really just comes down to to us as americans though i mean
[57:29.520 --> 57:34.080]  the fact that americans are putting up with this and i get that we're kind of like the tip of the
[57:34.080 --> 57:38.480]  spears so we get fed up with this first and then the rest of the people kind of catch up uh you're
[57:38.480 --> 57:47.200]  starting to see that but it's just not enough man waiting and giving the every day that obama and
[57:47.200 --> 57:52.240]  combi and brennan and clapper and rice are not behind bars and clinton and the rest of them aren't
[57:52.240 --> 57:58.560]  behind bars and bill gates and fouchy aren't behind bars they just get another 24 hours to plan their
[57:58.560 --> 58:03.760]  destruction of humanity they just get another 24 hours to make you a slave i mean they should not
[58:03.760 --> 58:11.920]  be afforded another minute to continue their diabolical death cult satanic luciferian cult
[58:11.920 --> 58:17.760]  operation that they have going on not another minute david every every minute that those people
[58:17.760 --> 58:25.760]  continue to walk free we lose a minute of freedom on the on the clock for for america's life so you
[58:25.760 --> 58:30.000]  know trump can tweet all day about it and he does but it's time for some serious action maybe he's
[58:30.000 --> 58:34.240]  waiting for american people to wake up and and understand what's going on but boy i've had enough
[58:34.240 --> 58:39.360]  in another issue david as info wars has been covering for years this is another one of their
[58:39.360 --> 58:46.640]  little uh power grabs here the cashless society yeah to stop coven anybody notice that uh about
[58:46.640 --> 58:51.360]  the middle of june the federal reserve talked about it on the show in the morning but about the
[58:51.360 --> 58:55.040]  middle of june the federal reserve said uh we got a shortage of coins we're going to start rationing
[58:55.040 --> 59:00.160]  coins maybe you've seen it i've seen it uh shortly after that when i was still going to the stores
[59:00.160 --> 59:04.000]  before they started the mask mandate at texas they're already putting up signs saying we've got a
[59:04.000 --> 59:09.040]  coin shortage and it's getting worse it's not getting any better another one of these things
[59:09.040 --> 59:17.280]  that we have a shortage of this i believe however is deliberate i think this is a push to take cash
[59:17.280 --> 59:22.320]  out of circulation because again they want to kettle everybody into cyberspace they want to
[59:22.320 --> 59:28.720]  kettle us into a digital currency and i think a big underlying reason why this thing is continuing
[59:28.720 --> 59:35.440]  the way that it is is because you have the financial bubble that was going to burst and they want to
[59:35.440 --> 59:42.160]  make sure that they burst it with the covid virus so that we don't grab the uh the guillotines as
[59:42.160 --> 59:46.400]  uh bloomberg put it he said hey you know we got a reorganized society here when he was talking
[59:46.400 --> 59:49.920]  you know we talked about the farmers and he denigrated the farmers what he was really talking
[59:49.920 --> 59:57.040]  about was the agrarian society being replaced by the industrial society and yes he was very condescending
[59:57.040 --> 1:00:02.480]  and uh denigrating towards people who were like that and then he finishes up talking about this
[1:00:02.480 --> 1:00:08.160]  revolution which is the technocratic revolution goes to smart people like me we're working on ai
[1:00:08.160 --> 1:00:15.120]  and automation to take their jobs and the bottom line which nobody picked up on was they talked about
[1:00:15.120 --> 1:00:20.880]  we've got to make sure that we give them money and keep them from coming after us with the guillotines
[1:00:20.880 --> 1:00:25.920]  that's the way he put it with the guillotines and that's what these people understand they have a
[1:00:25.920 --> 1:00:31.760]  reason to take away our society to take away our economy our jobs make us dependent on them
[1:00:31.760 --> 1:00:36.640]  they needed to have an excuse so we wouldn't grab the guillotines you know they've been talking about
[1:00:36.640 --> 1:00:41.360]  how they're going to take 50 percent of the transportation jobs in terms and it's not just
[1:00:41.360 --> 1:00:47.520]  people at the bottom end of industry they've done studies in south korea they talked about how
[1:00:47.520 --> 1:00:52.320]  it was going to be up to 70 percent of doctors and lawyers they were going to lose their jobs
[1:00:52.320 --> 1:00:57.840]  because of automation they need to have something there so we don't come after the corporations
[1:00:57.840 --> 1:01:01.200]  the billionaires and the governments who do this to us so now they can blame it on the
[1:01:01.200 --> 1:01:05.040]  covid situation and they're doing the same thing with the money they want to move us to a cashless
[1:01:05.040 --> 1:01:10.240]  society for control they started by talking about how dirty paper money was oh it's all
[1:01:10.240 --> 1:01:14.320]  contaminated with the covid virus now they tell us they've got a coin shortage interesting story
[1:01:14.320 --> 1:01:18.800]  coming out of milwaukee they had a local bank there the community state bank evidently somebody
[1:01:18.800 --> 1:01:22.640]  didn't clue them in as to what this agenda is because they're saying hey we've got a shortage
[1:01:22.640 --> 1:01:26.720]  on cash we're having to buy this from the federal reserve so we're putting out a bounty we're telling
[1:01:26.720 --> 1:01:30.960]  people you bring in a hundred dollars worth of coins we'll give you a hundred and five dollars
[1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:38.720]  worth of credit and but i don't realize that the whole point is to make sure they dry up the sources
[1:01:38.720 --> 1:01:44.080]  of cash because they're getting rid of cash because it gives you privacy it's just another lie it's
[1:01:44.080 --> 1:01:48.960]  just another bar in the prison of lies that we live in it's not about a coin shortage it's about
[1:01:48.960 --> 1:01:58.000]  taking cash from society ultra 12 is already our overall number one bestseller ultra 12 is twice
[1:01:58.000 --> 1:02:05.200]  as strong as secret 12 for an even lower price because i signed a huge multi-year contract
[1:02:05.200 --> 1:02:12.080]  to guarantee to buy a ton of it and my bet ended up to be successful so far folks are ordering it in
[1:02:12.080 --> 1:02:16.800]  mass they're getting great responses they're giving us incredible reviews because we know
[1:02:16.800 --> 1:02:21.840]  what vitamin b12 of this type does taken under the tongue where it's more absorbable it supports
[1:02:21.840 --> 1:02:28.000]  healthy nerve and brain cells helps make dna help the body produce more energy help produce
[1:02:28.000 --> 1:02:33.120]  healthy blood cells essential for proper nervous system function and so much more you can take all
[1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:37.680]  the energy drinks and they won't do anything if you don't have the basics already in your body
[1:02:37.680 --> 1:02:42.880]  like vitamin b12 whether you're old whether you're young whether you're black whether you're white
[1:02:42.880 --> 1:02:47.120]  whether you live in japan or the united states ultra 12 is the best vitamin b12 you're gonna
[1:02:47.120 --> 1:03:03.120]  find out there it's uber absorbable and it's 50 off right now at info wars life dot com
[1:03:08.720 --> 1:03:14.320]  all right ladies and gentlemen we're just rolling down the line at tyranny here
[1:03:14.320 --> 1:03:20.240]  and uh boy oh boy info wars has been trying to pump the brakes on this for years
[1:03:22.320 --> 1:03:25.040]  oh man and the brakes are engaged
[1:03:27.680 --> 1:03:31.920]  that they deep platformed us and then independent me because after they did us
[1:03:31.920 --> 1:03:37.680]  800 independent media sites went out and what have we seen on we've seen the corporate media
[1:03:37.680 --> 1:03:43.600]  controlled by less than a half dozen individuals we've seen them be able to turn public opinion
[1:03:43.600 --> 1:03:48.400]  on a dime and to completely reverse the narrative you know what we've seen in terms of masks and
[1:03:48.400 --> 1:03:54.080]  everything else i mean they can panic the public and then they can change the terms of that and
[1:03:54.080 --> 1:03:58.960]  they can do it instantaneously and they can do it globally because they've got hegemony
[1:03:58.960 --> 1:04:03.360]  on information that's why these people are scared to death and attacking people in the grocery stores
[1:04:03.360 --> 1:04:07.280]  right these people aren't doing it for power you got politicians who are doing it for power
[1:04:07.280 --> 1:04:14.000]  but the big problem is the mob out there that has been completely gaslighted into the scyop
[1:04:14.000 --> 1:04:17.120]  and they can do it because they've got a monopoly on information well that's the incredible thing
[1:04:17.120 --> 1:04:22.480]  about it too is the reason why they can pivot back and forth all day long and change their narratives
[1:04:22.480 --> 1:04:29.040]  whenever they want is they realize that they have tens of millions of americans literally under their
[1:04:29.040 --> 1:04:35.040]  mind control i mean literally under their mind control wear a mask today don't wear a mask tomorrow
[1:04:35.040 --> 1:04:39.040]  they could flip it back and forth and these people would go along with it whatever the latest call
[1:04:39.040 --> 1:04:42.880]  it is and some of them they might get confused they said oh foushee said not to wear a mask they said
[1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:47.520]  no no foushee said wear a mask now oh okay wear a mask now like that that's how incredible the
[1:04:47.520 --> 1:04:52.480]  brainwashing is folks uh and so we're talking about that we're gonna get back into it but again
[1:04:52.480 --> 1:04:57.520]  you know info wars has been trying to pump the brakes on this global tyranny for a long time
[1:04:57.520 --> 1:05:03.120]  now the break the brakes are finally engaged but the tyranny is going down a steep hill folks and
[1:05:03.120 --> 1:05:08.320]  so it's we're in desperate situation but uh info wars will still be here as long as your support
[1:05:08.320 --> 1:05:14.960]  continues at infostore.com now i have to tell you one of the ways i can measure how popular a product
[1:05:14.960 --> 1:05:22.720]  is without going and looking at statistics or numbers uh on our sales is when we bring a product in
[1:05:23.280 --> 1:05:29.200]  and i have it on my desk how long does it last before someone from the crew comes up here and
[1:05:29.200 --> 1:05:35.520]  grabblers it and so yesterday i was hosting the joneshow i had my red privacy pocket from info
[1:05:35.520 --> 1:05:42.880]  wars store.com i had my green privacy pocket from info wars store.com i had my blue privacy
[1:05:42.880 --> 1:05:49.280]  pocket from info wars store.com and i had my black privacy pocket from info wars store.com
[1:05:49.280 --> 1:05:56.560]  but the black one is gone so some little grabbler from the crew came here and took the black
[1:05:56.560 --> 1:06:03.360]  privacy pocket i will find who you are and i will confiscate that pocket back so that i can do a
[1:06:03.360 --> 1:06:08.000]  proper live read here on air and that the audience can see all of the different colors that we have
[1:06:08.000 --> 1:06:14.000]  in the privacy pocket uh but all jokes aside that's how i can tell when a product is really popular
[1:06:14.000 --> 1:06:18.880]  is uh when the crew really likes it and so hey look we don't like getting spied on either
[1:06:18.880 --> 1:06:23.360]  all right and uh the one thing uh you know i pretty much have to have my phone on all the time
[1:06:23.360 --> 1:06:29.200]  but the one thing i will do is when i decide i'm going to go to bed put it in here i do sleep
[1:06:29.200 --> 1:06:33.120]  better so there's definitely something i used to just put it in the other room but then if you're
[1:06:33.120 --> 1:06:36.480]  laying in bed or whatever you want to check your phone you got to go to the other room so
[1:06:36.480 --> 1:06:41.600]  now i just put it in the privacy pocket next to my bed and i'm not getting those harmful waves
[1:06:41.600 --> 1:06:45.440]  that keep me up at night and studies have even shown that that's true same thing goes for your
[1:06:45.440 --> 1:06:50.000]  internet box and other such things but this specifically for your cell phone here's the
[1:06:50.000 --> 1:06:56.080]  nice thing about it uh this case is so thin it's like paper thin you can put it in your pocket
[1:06:56.080 --> 1:07:00.560]  you barely even notice it's there unlike some of the other privacy uh ferrity enclosures that are
[1:07:00.560 --> 1:07:07.840]  very thick bulky not convenient this is paper thin can go right in a pocket and here's the other
[1:07:07.840 --> 1:07:14.880]  thing if you're like me um i i use my alarm on my cell phone some of the old cases were so big
[1:07:14.880 --> 1:07:19.600]  and bulky the alarm goes off you couldn't even hear it through there you can still hear your cell
[1:07:19.600 --> 1:07:26.320]  phone on alarm through this privacy pocket and so if you want to sleep with your phone next your
[1:07:26.320 --> 1:07:32.880]  bed not get the waves uh the cell phone waves but also want to use it for an alarm the privacy
[1:07:32.880 --> 1:07:39.200]  pocket at infowarstore.com is a go for you so we have the blue the green the red and the black
[1:07:39.200 --> 1:07:45.920]  privacy pockets all available at infowarstore.com paper thin stop the government from tracing and
[1:07:45.920 --> 1:07:51.520]  tracking you the chinese the communists the the left that actually does it now too quite frankly
[1:07:51.520 --> 1:07:56.080]  and you know that's really important because get the privacy pocket whether you know it or not even
[1:07:56.080 --> 1:08:01.280]  if you're not using your phone uh if you don't have it sealed up like that it's keeping track of
[1:08:01.280 --> 1:08:08.000]  everywhere that you're going and it's available to them uh to basically identify you as a suspected
[1:08:08.000 --> 1:08:12.960]  infected and so yeah you want to make sure that you don't leave those little breadcrumbs about
[1:08:12.960 --> 1:08:16.080]  everywhere you've been because that's one of the things that they've been talking about from the
[1:08:16.080 --> 1:08:21.120]  very even before they started the lockdown here oh and they were talking about how well you know
[1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:28.160]  the atlantic and other status uh you know pushing the globalism uh organizations were saying we can't
[1:08:28.160 --> 1:08:32.960]  handle this like the chinese can't they're in a better shape because they've got biometric
[1:08:32.960 --> 1:08:36.560]  surveillance and tracking of all their citizens and we're going to need that in order to shut this
[1:08:36.560 --> 1:08:41.120]  down yeah don't you know it's so much easier to track and trace slaves just be a slave good american
[1:08:41.120 --> 1:08:44.720]  so that's been in the works for a long time and again like all the rest of this stuff
[1:08:44.720 --> 1:08:48.960]  now COVID-19 just like universal basic income just like taking people's jobs
[1:08:48.960 --> 1:08:53.600]  this surveillance thing the excuse for that is COVID-19 just like the excuse for well
[1:08:53.600 --> 1:08:57.360]  you know we're going to have a financial collapse collapse of the dollar that was baked in that's
[1:08:57.360 --> 1:09:03.680]  been baked in since the 2007 crash they just inflated it they can only do that for so long
[1:09:03.680 --> 1:09:09.200]  you can only uh suspend disbelief for a certain amount of time and eventually Wiley coyote sees
[1:09:09.200 --> 1:09:12.480]  that there's nothing underneath them we're about at that moment now but now they're going to say
[1:09:12.480 --> 1:09:18.240]  that the ankle tied to our feet is the COVID-19 it's not their financial policy so that's the key
[1:09:18.240 --> 1:09:23.440]  thing is make sure you don't have that thing constantly tracking you and uh saving that
[1:09:23.440 --> 1:09:29.040]  information about you and i would also suggest never take a COVID test oh yeah avoid that thing
[1:09:29.040 --> 1:09:33.360]  at all costs i understand people have to do it to get back to work whatever but if you can never
[1:09:33.360 --> 1:09:38.240]  take that COVID test because now they're they're in folks soon as they get that test they're in
[1:09:38.240 --> 1:09:43.360]  whether you taste positive or not um real quick let's go over some of these headlines uh nursing
[1:09:43.360 --> 1:09:50.800]  home death warrants again it just highlights the numbers and how half almost half of the COVID deaths
[1:09:50.800 --> 1:09:56.000]  came from nursing homes in new york new jersey california pennsylvania and michigan
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:01.680]  where the governors intentionally sent COVID infected patients into the nursing homes to kill
[1:10:01.680 --> 1:10:06.880]  them and get the numbers up yes that's murder this helps with their unfunded liabilities for
[1:10:06.880 --> 1:10:12.480]  pension so i'm not i guess that's the uh the the bright side for fouchy why he's saying that
[1:10:12.480 --> 1:10:17.040]  quomo did a great job well yeah he murdered the most yeah don't you know you get the that's right
[1:10:17.040 --> 1:10:22.320]  the more people you murder the better you fout he's a eugenicist he wants you to die yeah so fouchy
[1:10:22.320 --> 1:10:26.880]  naturally wants you to die sees that governor quomo killed about 10 000 people in nursing homes
[1:10:26.880 --> 1:10:32.320]  and he says wow look at how new york is handling it very well very good job governor quomo you
[1:10:32.320 --> 1:10:37.200]  murdered 10 000 people in a nursing home we're very proud of you thank you for that south carolina
[1:10:37.200 --> 1:10:42.400]  dog euthanized after testing positive for coronavirus this makes me sick david so first of all we
[1:10:42.400 --> 1:10:47.680]  know the tests aren't even 100 accurate uh but they're now claiming dogs are getting COVID and then
[1:10:47.680 --> 1:10:53.440]  their their people are killing their dog when they get a positive that could be a false positive for
[1:10:53.440 --> 1:10:58.880]  COVID well they're not only inaccurate but the person who developed the pcr test said you aren't
[1:10:58.880 --> 1:11:04.320]  supposed to use it for it won't give you any ever give you valid results for that this will be zero
[1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:09.600]  percent accurate so don't listen to the guy who invented it don't listen to the Nobel prize winning
[1:11:09.600 --> 1:11:15.440]  scientist who who developed it no just just do what fouchy said because fouchy has authority
[1:11:15.440 --> 1:11:21.040]  and he's got science uh and so just whether men are more accurate than these people and by the way
[1:11:21.040 --> 1:11:25.600]  that that don't that's science well that's what they've done they've taken climate change they
[1:11:25.600 --> 1:11:29.760]  pulled out the the climate nonsense and they stuck COVID in it's literally the same model say
[1:11:29.760 --> 1:11:34.800]  people it's the same people same policies yeah same policies all of the green new deal they brought
[1:11:34.800 --> 1:11:40.160]  in and i guess we should call it the uh the mucus new deal or something look at this i'm telling you
[1:11:40.160 --> 1:11:46.160]  the world is gone bat crap crazy no evidence dogs and cats can get COVID so these people literally
[1:11:46.160 --> 1:11:51.840]  got a false positive on a COVID test from their dog and killed their dog yeah i mean i i i i i i
[1:11:51.840 --> 1:12:00.000]  breaks my heart man people are killing their own dogs by the way the science was already
[1:12:00.000 --> 1:12:03.840]  in on masks i had a doctor on the war room last week folks there's there's literally
[1:12:04.480 --> 1:12:11.200]  dozens of mask studies from the 80s from the 90s early 2000s all found the same thing the mask
[1:12:11.200 --> 1:12:18.560]  doesn't stop anything it doesn't stop anything and the cdc has the mask too the stores at info
[1:12:18.560 --> 1:12:24.800]  wars dot com dear humans face masks don't work the study reviewed the study review was published by
[1:12:24.800 --> 1:12:30.400]  your very own cdc but there's multiple that means david you can go back for decades and find all
[1:12:30.400 --> 1:12:35.040]  these different scientific studies on masks and they all found the same thing the mask one doesn't
[1:12:35.040 --> 1:12:40.480]  stop the spread of this flu which is what they were working with specifically two is more dangerous
[1:12:40.480 --> 1:12:44.720]  for you to wear the mask because you're breathing in your own carbon dioxide and when you wear the
[1:12:44.720 --> 1:12:49.600]  same mask over and over it builds up all the things you're getting out of your body bacteria and such
[1:12:49.600 --> 1:12:53.760]  and you actually end up getting sick there are a lot of reasons to get an alex jones plastic
[1:12:53.760 --> 1:12:59.520]  mask at infowarstore.com you can wear them out to political events you can trigger live darts
[1:12:59.520 --> 1:13:05.120]  but one of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter at any costume party or
[1:13:05.760 --> 1:13:10.960]  at halloween but on top of that they admit that wearing these masks does absolutely nothing to
[1:13:10.960 --> 1:13:15.680]  protect you from COVID-19 or anything else it's total virtues signaling to show that you're prepared
[1:13:15.680 --> 1:13:20.800]  for the force inoculations and contact tracing that they're openly announcing it's an active
[1:13:20.800 --> 1:13:25.920]  submission it's an act of like putting a burqa on your head and bowing down but a big reason to wear
[1:13:25.920 --> 1:13:30.960]  these is then into stores when people ask you why you're wearing a halloween mask say it's just as
[1:13:30.960 --> 1:13:37.120]  useless as the stupid cloth masks that you're wearing and the m95 mask only control what's
[1:13:37.120 --> 1:13:42.160]  coming in not what's going out so they quote spread COVID-19 they don't protect from it so
[1:13:42.160 --> 1:13:46.800]  again it's a great way to throw it back at these control freak spaces you buy one for 995 you get
[1:13:46.800 --> 1:13:54.000]  four more free they're at cost infowarstore.com any reasons that the globalist launch this planetary
[1:13:54.000 --> 1:14:00.320]  lockdown the number one reason is it serves every one of their purposes we've gone over
[1:14:00.320 --> 1:14:06.720]  those purposes many times here on air the casual society the surveillance system global
[1:14:06.720 --> 1:14:12.800]  government medical tyranny force inoculation but the most important facet is it teaches us that we
[1:14:12.800 --> 1:14:21.440]  are obsolete that we are non-essential as we begin to witness automation computers and robots
[1:14:21.440 --> 1:14:29.040]  take over the jobs that people once had by design this isn't like it's some advancement that we just
[1:14:29.040 --> 1:14:35.840]  fell into it's been pre-planned organized globally and it's extremely predatory and through
[1:14:35.840 --> 1:14:42.400]  governmental actuaries and tax programs and regulations the central banks that control it all
[1:14:42.400 --> 1:14:49.120]  are able to pick the winners and the losers and consolidate power this is the truest form of
[1:14:49.120 --> 1:15:07.600]  technocracy fascism you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:15:19.120 --> 1:15:32.960]  all right very important topics here with david night on the alex jones show and and this is
[1:15:32.960 --> 1:15:37.200]  something we're all facing ladies and gentlemen just a couple quick headlines before david gets
[1:15:37.200 --> 1:15:43.760]  into the weeds here but it's just a joke guys and i know that it's like oh you say this every day
[1:15:43.760 --> 1:15:48.000]  hey you know what new people tune in every day too and so they need to get this news too
[1:15:48.000 --> 1:15:54.480]  folks they're faking the covid numbers all right hundred percent faking the numbers okay faking it
[1:15:54.480 --> 1:15:59.440]  up to ten thousand percent higher than what it really is that are they're rebranded rebranded the
[1:15:59.440 --> 1:16:05.920]  flu essentially after they released this bio weapon out of china um question raise questions
[1:16:05.920 --> 1:16:10.720]  raised after fatal motorcycle crash listed as covid-19 death just one example of many
[1:16:11.680 --> 1:16:17.920]  contact tracing might become cop's new surveillance tool oh it's trendy so it's like oh so i mean
[1:16:17.920 --> 1:16:26.320]  uh can you actually can you find a more uh can you find a better example of how insane and mentally
[1:16:26.320 --> 1:16:32.960]  ill the left is than the whole defund the police but yet let's have police arresting people if they
[1:16:32.960 --> 1:16:39.200]  don't wear a mask or if they don't self quarantine i mean if you list it off if you actually took
[1:16:39.200 --> 1:16:44.400]  the time and you listed off all the different liberal talking points ideologies protests and
[1:16:44.400 --> 1:16:52.560]  you put it down on one paper you would see how double standard ideal clashing insane it really is
[1:16:52.560 --> 1:16:56.720]  it's just flavor of the week lick your finger and see which way the wind blows with these people
[1:16:56.720 --> 1:17:00.960]  defund the police oh but harass people at their house if they're not quarantining or wearing a mask
[1:17:01.520 --> 1:17:07.360]  um but the big thing david that we were getting into uh and you want to focus on here is how
[1:17:07.360 --> 1:17:14.000]  coronavirus is being used to remake the world economy and that's really what it is and i've
[1:17:14.000 --> 1:17:19.760]  got all these stories right here u.s companies lose hope for quick rebound from covet intentional
[1:17:19.760 --> 1:17:26.160]  government and intentional economic shutdown not not because of an actual issue a manufactured
[1:17:26.160 --> 1:17:33.200]  economic shutdown recovery narratives fall short third of small firms cut workers to survive america's
[1:17:33.200 --> 1:17:39.600]  hidden economic crisis wades widespread wage cuts firms with troubled past though get millions of
[1:17:39.600 --> 1:17:46.000]  dollars in ppp small business loans san francisco gate congress created virus aid then reaped the
[1:17:46.000 --> 1:17:52.000]  benefits folks they stole billions of dollars from us billions billions billions coin shortage
[1:17:52.000 --> 1:17:56.800]  prompts bank it's not a real corn shortage made up another another fake pandemic fake uh coin
[1:17:56.800 --> 1:18:02.960]  shortage prompts bank to pay you for spare change never had before so it's all about control it's
[1:18:02.960 --> 1:18:08.080]  all about manipulation uh it's all being branded about with lies and i have a whole stack of the
[1:18:08.080 --> 1:18:13.040]  lies here but david talk about how they're going to use this to try to reset the global economy
[1:18:13.040 --> 1:18:18.880]  and and make the free market a thing of the past and notice how they spun that uh that coin
[1:18:18.880 --> 1:18:24.320]  headline oh and it's like oh look uh we got a corn shortage but that's okay because these people
[1:18:24.320 --> 1:18:29.920]  made more money by selling their coins to the bank yeah now we have all your coins yeah they're
[1:18:29.920 --> 1:18:36.160]  gonna give you five dollars in credit of a fiat currency so they're gonna take away cash because
[1:18:36.160 --> 1:18:42.960]  they want to take away your ability to operate outside of their control structures and whenever
[1:18:42.960 --> 1:18:48.320]  we look at something we always need to ask um follow the money who is behind this and typically
[1:18:48.320 --> 1:18:52.960]  it traces back to a bank the hook to the central banks right not a bank but the central banks
[1:18:53.600 --> 1:18:57.760]  and they're the ones who basically push wars they're the ones who push depressions
[1:18:57.760 --> 1:19:03.440]  and they're the ones who are pushing this global reset in a big way and a big part of this is going
[1:19:03.440 --> 1:19:10.320]  to be uh the currency and if you think that what we've seen so far is disruptive you haven't seen
[1:19:10.320 --> 1:19:15.040]  even the tip of the iceberg of what these people have planned this is why we have to resist this
[1:19:15.040 --> 1:19:20.800]  as forcefully as we can at this point in time because where they're going with this besides
[1:19:20.800 --> 1:19:26.560]  the mask besides the vaccine mandates and the health issues with that this is a major restructuring
[1:19:26.560 --> 1:19:34.080]  of society it is covering over their tracks it is moving people away from what they've done the same
[1:19:34.080 --> 1:19:38.880]  way that hillary clinton did it with the emails right she had violated all the national security
[1:19:38.880 --> 1:19:44.320]  laws she had rigged the election internally with dnc and when people started looking at that she said
[1:19:44.320 --> 1:19:49.760]  russians russians right it's a red herring and uh this is what the coronavirus has been it's been
[1:19:49.760 --> 1:19:55.200]  a mechanism for them to impose what they had planned all along and part of that is to restructure
[1:19:55.200 --> 1:20:01.040]  everything into a global cryptocurrency and when you look at how this is shaking down just
[1:20:01.040 --> 1:20:07.040]  understand that at this point in time we've got over 40 million people who have been uh unemployed
[1:20:07.040 --> 1:20:14.160]  by fiat by command of the american government the central government the federal government the
[1:20:14.160 --> 1:20:19.200]  white house because folks you can talk about it being guidelines and recommendations but that's
[1:20:19.200 --> 1:20:23.680]  the way they're rolling all of this stuff out when they talk about the mandatory vaccinations
[1:20:23.680 --> 1:20:28.560]  they're also saying well we don't want to make this a law we don't want to make it a crime
[1:20:28.560 --> 1:20:33.520]  because that's going to invite challenges and due process and we want to shut that down the way
[1:20:33.520 --> 1:20:39.120]  these people have always operated is by guidelines and recommendations by regulations that come from
[1:20:39.120 --> 1:20:44.960]  unelected regulatory agencies rather than laws coming from your elected representatives and they
[1:20:44.960 --> 1:20:50.400]  claim that those regulations do not require the presumption of innocence due process or things
[1:20:50.400 --> 1:20:55.840]  like protection from excessive fines and so that's the way they're talking about and openly talking
[1:20:55.840 --> 1:21:00.320]  about in the media how they're going to force the vaccinations on us and by the way this is so
[1:21:00.320 --> 1:21:06.640]  illegal this is like if you own a business okay and for whatever reason it's not doing well or you
[1:21:06.640 --> 1:21:11.840]  just want to take time off or whatever it's like you go in to your business and you throw a brick
[1:21:11.840 --> 1:21:16.080]  through the window and then you call up your insurance agent or your clients or whatever you
[1:21:16.080 --> 1:21:21.680]  say oh sorry i got a broken window here i can't do business for the next month by the way i need
[1:21:21.680 --> 1:21:26.880]  an insurance payment too you through the big brick through the window you shut your business
[1:21:26.880 --> 1:21:31.840]  town that's what they're doing they shut it all down they spread the virus they caused the coin
[1:21:31.840 --> 1:21:36.720]  shortage they caused the economic disaster and then they want us to pay for it and then they want
[1:21:36.720 --> 1:21:41.520]  more regulations because of the uh of the things that they've done and of course this is always
[1:21:41.520 --> 1:21:45.360]  uh what the government is that whenever they fail they say well you know the the answer to this is
[1:21:45.360 --> 1:21:50.400]  that we need to spend more money going further debt and we need to have more power over your life
[1:21:50.400 --> 1:21:54.880]  that's always the answer to everything that they do and so when we look at this the fact that we've
[1:21:54.880 --> 1:22:00.800]  got 50 million people unemployed but people really haven't felt the effect of this yet why because
[1:22:00.800 --> 1:22:04.480]  they're just printing paper money like you know there's there's nothing behind it because there
[1:22:04.480 --> 1:22:10.720]  is nothing behind it we had in in january of 2019 the congressional budget office
[1:22:10.720 --> 1:22:17.040]  this sounded the alarm they said we're at nearly a trillion dollar deficit for the year we cannot
[1:22:17.040 --> 1:22:22.880]  continue doing this folks we added a trillion dollars in june to the deficit in one month
[1:22:22.880 --> 1:22:27.680]  and they were saying we cannot continue to go down this path it will be disastrous so what is
[1:22:27.680 --> 1:22:33.760]  going to happen is that uh there's not going to be we're going to go down the path of hyperinflation
[1:22:33.760 --> 1:22:37.760]  or something like that not sure if it's going to go into depression there's a big debate as to
[1:22:37.760 --> 1:22:43.120]  how this is going to collapse but it is going to collapse if we continue to go down this path if
[1:22:43.120 --> 1:22:48.000]  we continue down with this lockdown and that's what i'm saying the democrats and the status
[1:22:48.000 --> 1:22:54.400]  so that they can win an election they're more than willing to destroy this country because at the end
[1:22:54.400 --> 1:22:59.440]  they're going to be able to remake society into the socialist state that they want so as we look at
[1:22:59.440 --> 1:23:06.000]  this this is something that has been talked about gamed by these people just like the pandemics have
[1:23:06.000 --> 1:23:12.400]  been gamed by them for decades and we've got a lot of some of the titles here uh headlines probably by
[1:23:12.400 --> 1:23:17.920]  the end of the year alistair mccleod warns the dollar is on the way to zero what happens when
[1:23:17.920 --> 1:23:23.760]  that happens at that point we're no longer able to just hand out pieces of paper to people and
[1:23:23.760 --> 1:23:28.240]  tell them you can stay home and play video games and you can make more than you did when you had a
[1:23:28.240 --> 1:23:34.000]  job all of that comes to a screeching halt and when that comes to a screeching halt watch out for
[1:23:34.000 --> 1:23:39.280]  the violence on the streets you haven't seen anything yet all right when we come back we'll
[1:23:39.280 --> 1:23:46.720]  get more into this news and uh i got a little analogy what is happening right now they think
[1:23:46.720 --> 1:23:52.800]  that by throwing us to drown in the lake they won't drown themselves it's the end of the world as we
[1:23:52.800 --> 1:24:04.320]  know it it's the end of the world as we know it it's the end of the world as we know it i feel
[1:24:04.320 --> 1:24:12.720]  fine it's the end of the world as we know it and i don't feel fun this entire takeover has been
[1:24:12.720 --> 1:24:19.440]  battle planned blueprinted war game field marshaled by the psychological war chiefs at the united
[1:24:19.440 --> 1:24:25.920]  nations and the fortune 100 this is the post-human takeover the new skits tighter when you comply
[1:24:26.480 --> 1:24:32.880]  not looser the entire covet 19 operation as a hoax now they admit that quote death numbers
[1:24:32.880 --> 1:24:36.720]  are dropping because those are fake where they count people that died of something else but
[1:24:36.720 --> 1:24:41.520]  it's all about how many cases there are and now they're saying most of the population will get it
[1:24:41.520 --> 1:24:50.240]  and then no one can go outside ever again it's totally insane it's a fraud it's all alive the
[1:24:50.240 --> 1:24:56.160]  bad news is western governments have totally let multinational big tech bring in communist
[1:24:56.160 --> 1:25:02.560]  shiny style total net surveillance censorship with ai the good news is they had to do that
[1:25:02.560 --> 1:25:09.200]  to carry out this world government covet takeover this planetary corporate reset the covet covers
[1:25:09.200 --> 1:25:15.040]  for because the truth is powerful and will defeat them and will smash them and the good news is
[1:25:15.040 --> 1:25:22.400]  there are still sites like band dot video news wars dot com info wars dot com paul watson sites
[1:25:22.400 --> 1:25:27.840]  summit dot news and a lot of other great sites that are getting massive traffic thanks to you
[1:25:27.840 --> 1:25:36.160]  and your word of mouth that is king that is queen that is the master of our own destinies ladies and
[1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:41.920]  gentlemen there is a war on reality a war on civilization a war on our health a war on our
[1:25:41.920 --> 1:25:47.440]  economy but being aware of it and standing up to it and speaking out against it will defeat it so
[1:25:47.440 --> 1:25:53.600]  take action or be slaves as the years go by it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's

[1:27:07.760 --> 1:27:18.720]  we're back inside the info wars world headquarters in austin texas oren shroyer david night with me
[1:27:18.720 --> 1:27:25.360]  for one more segment here's the analogy that i really want the left to understand i know a lot
[1:27:25.360 --> 1:27:31.040]  of you guys tune into this and you really think you're heroic for fighting fake oppression and
[1:27:31.040 --> 1:27:36.160]  fake racism really good job for you guys you get the participation award congratulations what you
[1:27:36.160 --> 1:27:45.920]  need to understand is we all americans no matter what your skin color or political ideology is we
[1:27:45.920 --> 1:27:53.840]  are all attached at the hip we're all shackled in this together so we'll all have a destiny bond
[1:27:54.560 --> 1:28:03.280]  with one another that's how this goes so when you take that 500 pound millstone
[1:28:03.280 --> 1:28:10.480]  and you tie it around our ankle and you toss it into the ocean so that we drown and die you're
[1:28:10.480 --> 1:28:17.200]  coming with us but you know david my fear is that they already know that and they don't care yeah
[1:28:17.200 --> 1:28:22.480]  they're in a death cult and they would they would gladly die as long as they they get to see that
[1:28:22.480 --> 1:28:27.760]  they get to have that victory over us and and have us die too this is the death cult that the left
[1:28:27.760 --> 1:28:34.640]  has become you know there was a quote i saw today on twitter i retweeted it it was from iran and she
[1:28:34.640 --> 1:28:39.360]  said the difference between communism and socialism is that communism proposes to enslave people by
[1:28:39.360 --> 1:28:48.160]  force socialism does it by vote and so really the difference between the two systems is death by
[1:28:48.160 --> 1:28:53.360]  murder or death by suicide and that's really what we're looking at here oan because we've got
[1:28:53.360 --> 1:29:02.720]  essentially a suicide cult on the covid 19 side and on the antifa street riots this is a a murder
[1:29:02.720 --> 1:29:08.240]  cult and and so we're kind of caught between those two forces and that that is really what
[1:29:08.240 --> 1:29:14.800]  we're looking at right now it really is a race between those two and it's born out of the idea
[1:29:14.800 --> 1:29:21.600]  i had a article this morning there was a guy who was russian and he'd looked at some russian novels
[1:29:21.600 --> 1:29:28.960]  and he said i see a lot of similarities here between pre russian revolution uh and the between
[1:29:28.960 --> 1:29:33.360]  before the xarist revolution and the marxist revolution in russia and what is happening
[1:29:33.360 --> 1:29:36.560]  in america today and you could see it in the novels you could see it in the characters
[1:29:36.560 --> 1:29:41.920]  who were embracing this kind of nihilism just destroy everything the system can't be fixed
[1:29:41.920 --> 1:29:46.560]  it's too far gone we've got to destroy everything and just begin from the ground up and that's
[1:29:46.560 --> 1:29:51.280]  exactly what we're hearing from the people today and it's not because there's a connection between
[1:29:51.280 --> 1:29:56.560]  us and russia but it's because this is a cycle in history i've talked about this many times
[1:29:56.560 --> 1:30:00.720]  the fourth turning we're at a point now where it's obvious to everybody the institutions have
[1:30:00.720 --> 1:30:07.440]  failed leadership has failed and there is a a move a significant move within society
[1:30:07.440 --> 1:30:13.520]  out of fear and uh everything else it just to shut down society and let it fall we've seen this
[1:30:13.520 --> 1:30:20.080]  in the past it is a recurring uh uh feature of history we saw this in the fall of the roman empire
[1:30:20.080 --> 1:30:24.880]  the fact that people were just fed up with the corruption of roam and they let the barbarians
[1:30:24.880 --> 1:30:31.760]  tear everything down and that is precisely what is happening now this is a major uh turn coming
[1:30:31.760 --> 1:30:36.800]  up in society and it's something that they've planned for for quite a long time if you look
[1:30:36.800 --> 1:30:41.040]  at everything that's being established right now not only is it the un 2030 agenda but going back
[1:30:41.040 --> 1:30:46.080]  to the 1970s you had the big new brzezinski mika's father talking about the technocratic
[1:30:46.080 --> 1:30:51.760]  revolution how we were caught between two ages how they were going to basically be able to
[1:30:51.760 --> 1:30:56.080]  track and observe everything that we had how they were going to make themselves technological
[1:30:56.080 --> 1:31:01.520]  overlords uh using technology as a leverage that is what is being ushered in right now this is a
[1:31:01.520 --> 1:31:07.840]  major change like the industrial revolution replacing the agrarian revolution and these
[1:31:07.840 --> 1:31:14.640]  types of major changes are typically accompanied with massive economic disruption uh depression
[1:31:14.640 --> 1:31:20.000]  like the last one was a great depression world war two and they usually are accompanied by war
[1:31:20.000 --> 1:31:25.280]  yeah but here's the problem with this david is it's it's a lie because if they really wanted to
[1:31:25.280 --> 1:31:30.800]  start thing from things from the ground up which we would do it would be in the free market it would
[1:31:30.800 --> 1:31:34.640]  be that would be starting things from the ground up is getting the government hands off of all of
[1:31:34.640 --> 1:31:40.240]  our stuff and saying okay yes this has gotten a big out of control it has to go by the wayside
[1:31:40.240 --> 1:31:44.160]  and that just brings back the free market it just brings back the organic free market
[1:31:44.160 --> 1:31:50.400]  but the reason why they manufacture the reset is so that the guilty parties the ones responsible
[1:31:50.400 --> 1:31:56.000]  for the economic collapse who are manufacturing it never pay the price so the big banks who who
[1:31:56.000 --> 1:32:01.920]  hedged all their bets and are really trillions in debt not you it's the big banks they won't suffer
[1:32:01.920 --> 1:32:08.240]  all the politicians that stole billions of dollars and rely on their no bid contracts with
[1:32:08.240 --> 1:32:14.080]  their friends and their rat holes and wall street they won't have that mean of income anymore because
[1:32:14.080 --> 1:32:18.560]  it's because we have a real reset no they're manufacturing the collapse and reset so that
[1:32:18.560 --> 1:32:24.320]  they have total power over the next system well that's right but they understand that there is
[1:32:24.320 --> 1:32:29.600]  a cycle in human history where people after a system has been in place for about 70 or 80 years
[1:32:29.600 --> 1:32:34.720]  people want to change it they have they have their model of how they would like to see society
[1:32:34.720 --> 1:32:39.840]  changed if we don't understand that we're in the middle of this cycle right now the cycle of change
[1:32:39.840 --> 1:32:44.880]  then we are going to be patsies for what they are imposing on us if we understand that this is a
[1:32:44.880 --> 1:32:52.800]  point of change then we can try to to move against this and not just be passive in this if we don't
[1:32:52.800 --> 1:32:56.480]  understand what these people are doing and of course they knew when this was going to happen
[1:32:57.040 --> 1:33:02.720]  they talk about 2030 that's been in the works for these people for decades and even going back
[1:33:02.720 --> 1:33:06.960]  to us trouson how wrote about the fourth turning in the mid in the early 90s they talked about how
[1:33:06.960 --> 1:33:11.920]  in the mid 2000s it'd be a global financial crisis that would kick off something that would finish
[1:33:11.920 --> 1:33:17.760]  about 2029 2030 and that's what we're in the middle of right now these people are exploiting
[1:33:18.400 --> 1:33:22.720]  this cycle in human history and they're exploiting it to our detriment and that's why we have to
[1:33:22.720 --> 1:33:26.960]  understand this and you know oh and when we look at this and we say well what can we do because
[1:33:26.960 --> 1:33:31.920]  these systems are global they're highly technocratic we don't have a lot of control over this well we
[1:33:31.920 --> 1:33:38.720]  do at the local level and unless and until we start to take control of this at the local level
[1:33:38.720 --> 1:33:44.320]  i'm looking at one example here el salvador village adopts bitcoin as money i don't think that's a
[1:33:44.320 --> 1:33:49.680]  solution however we've seen a lot of local communities come in and establish their own
[1:33:50.400 --> 1:33:54.880]  local community dollars i think it's going to have to be something like that when this financial
[1:33:54.880 --> 1:34:00.720]  collapse comes and so we need to start making relationships in our communities we need to
[1:34:00.720 --> 1:34:06.240]  as we're being kicked out of grocery stores we need to start making relationships with local farmers
[1:34:07.040 --> 1:34:11.360]  and you know go to a farmer's market meet some people who are actually growing stuff
[1:34:11.360 --> 1:34:15.280]  establish a relationship with them maybe you can find something that you can barter with them
[1:34:15.840 --> 1:34:20.080]  when the thing hits the fan but you need to start thinking about this now the reason i talk about
[1:34:20.080 --> 1:34:25.120]  this gloom and doom stuff is because we don't want to go into this just sleepwalking into this
[1:34:25.120 --> 1:34:29.520]  with a polyana idea that if the republicans get elected everything is going to be fine it's not
[1:34:29.520 --> 1:34:36.080]  going to be fine the republican leadership is in on this plan and they have been in on this plan
[1:34:36.080 --> 1:34:40.880]  many in the republican party most of them in fact if not all of them are globalists and
[1:34:40.880 --> 1:34:45.520]  they're in on this so you got to start looking out for yourself you got to realize that the federal
[1:34:45.520 --> 1:34:49.920]  government and the national and the state governments have been co-opted for the most part
[1:34:49.920 --> 1:34:55.120]  and understand that you've got to start rebuilding society from your family from the local community
[1:34:55.120 --> 1:34:59.840]  up that's why when we talk about schools i hope they don't start the schools back up trump was
[1:34:59.840 --> 1:35:04.400]  right when he read the speech that somebody wrote for him at mount rushmore saying the root of our
[1:35:04.400 --> 1:35:08.880]  problem of our society is in the schools the only reason they want to get the schools started is
[1:35:08.880 --> 1:35:14.880]  because that's a way that they can get the economy going but that's as toxic a solution as taking a
[1:35:14.880 --> 1:35:20.880]  vaccine we've got to start thinking about the root causes of these problems and start doing something
[1:35:20.880 --> 1:35:26.240]  about it ourselves because there aren't any heroes on the horizon coming to save us and by the way
[1:35:27.200 --> 1:35:32.000]  they want to roll out the digital school and this is all chinese backed and chinese propaganda
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:39.600]  by the way because here's what they're going to do the chinese agents of propaganda will be watching
[1:35:39.600 --> 1:35:45.680]  all classroom activity and they will find teachers that don't go along with the communist agenda
[1:35:45.680 --> 1:35:50.800]  and they will be relieved of duty oh yeah and so that's what's coming next to the party line that's
[1:35:50.800 --> 1:35:54.640]  what's coming next for the school system it's all going to be monitored by the chinese communists
[1:35:54.640 --> 1:36:00.160]  that's why they want it on the chinese communist platforms like zoom and you know whatever apple
[1:36:00.160 --> 1:36:06.240]  comes out with next so uh that's where this is going now the good news is attorney general bar
[1:36:06.800 --> 1:36:12.640]  and josh howley have both made significant statements against china including howley
[1:36:12.640 --> 1:36:16.880]  saying that it's time for american corporations to stop exploiting chinese slave labor but you
[1:36:16.880 --> 1:36:21.360]  know we'll see if the uh self-righteous virtue signaling social justice warriors want to take
[1:36:21.360 --> 1:36:26.240]  up that mantle david yeah well it's going to require more than just virtue signaling we know
[1:36:26.240 --> 1:36:31.040]  that it's it's slave labor and we know that it's continuing to go on and a lot of this rhetoric
[1:36:31.040 --> 1:36:35.440]  is just to score political points you got to understand that there are concrete things that
[1:36:35.440 --> 1:36:40.320]  could have been done that should be done now they're not being done now you better start preparing
[1:36:40.320 --> 1:36:46.880]  at the local level you and your family but i went to a blm uh protest with an apple watch and nike
[1:36:46.880 --> 1:36:53.040]  hoodie i'm woke a lot of you have been listening for more than 20 years and if you go back to those
[1:36:53.040 --> 1:36:59.920]  shows we laid out the ai takeover plan the tracking of cell phones how programmed master
[1:36:59.920 --> 1:37:06.320]  computers would manipulate control society how they'd be able to not just predict large groups of
[1:37:06.320 --> 1:37:10.960]  human movements and activities but even predict what individuals would do and then once you could
[1:37:10.960 --> 1:37:16.960]  predict what individuals were going to be doing you can add stimuli through the ai systems through
[1:37:16.960 --> 1:37:22.320]  the computers through digital billboards through face scanning through the social credit score
[1:37:22.320 --> 1:37:27.600]  to control people and make them act like you wanted to but when we cover that the media would attack
[1:37:27.600 --> 1:37:32.880]  us and say we were making it up it was a conspiracy theory even though it was in the actual corporate
[1:37:32.880 --> 1:37:38.400]  level blueprint documents well the next level of the blueprint documents explained to us that they are
[1:37:38.400 --> 1:37:43.360]  setting up this control system to make humans obsolete and phase us out and it's something
[1:37:43.360 --> 1:37:48.160]  about a thousand times crazier than what hitler planned so we might want to dismantle the system
[1:37:48.160 --> 1:37:56.160]  now cnn usa today and other main street media fake news outlets came out and said that a new
[1:37:56.160 --> 1:38:03.440]  trump campaign t-shirt that has an american eagle spreading its wings standing on top of an american
[1:38:03.440 --> 1:38:09.680]  flag is not seeing and they had the soros funded snopes groups and others fact check it to say yes
[1:38:09.680 --> 1:38:14.960]  now the american flag and yes the american eagle are not suits no george soros that funds the

[1:41:15.120 --> 1:41:21.200]  it's just telling it like it is folks you know it's like getting a cancer diagnosis or whatever
[1:41:21.200 --> 1:41:25.600]  else it's like hey i'm not trying to make you depressed i'm not trying to put your
[1:41:25.600 --> 1:41:32.800]  mood down or ruin your day but you know you're gonna have to deal with this you're gonna have
[1:41:32.800 --> 1:41:40.480]  to accept this the democrat party the left-wing media and the street liberal thugs are cancer
[1:41:40.480 --> 1:41:48.160]  to this country they're cancer now unlike cancer they actually have the or maybe they don't the
[1:41:48.160 --> 1:41:54.400]  sole consciousness to decide not to be a cancer cell but you know i get the feeling if the chinese
[1:41:54.400 --> 1:42:01.360]  communists rolled up onto the beaches of california and started taking this country over i have a
[1:42:01.360 --> 1:42:06.000]  feeling that the progressive liberal democrats would join the the chinese communists because
[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:12.640]  they hate america that much and it's all because of the mainstream news lies uh you know abraham
[1:42:12.640 --> 1:42:19.360]  lincoln threw journalists and and people in the media in prison and i don't want to go that far
[1:42:19.360 --> 1:42:28.880]  and say that because well for obvious reasons but it's not about people in media it's about the people
[1:42:28.880 --> 1:42:33.360]  that are committing treason against this country the people that are committing insurrection against
[1:42:33.360 --> 1:42:39.200]  this country the people that are yelling fire in a movie theater that's what's going on with
[1:42:39.200 --> 1:42:45.920]  covid that's what's going on with president trump it's just so fragile and honestly the
[1:42:45.920 --> 1:42:50.400]  the that's why really the only thing to fix this is just the american people i mean that's it
[1:42:52.800 --> 1:42:58.000]  but they've been so brainwashed and dumbed down by design they've been hit with a psychological
[1:42:58.000 --> 1:43:08.400]  weapon they can't even see or comprehend and folks most of that is right here in your pocket
[1:43:08.400 --> 1:43:15.360]  every day on the cell phone with the propaganda that comes through with the tracing and tracking
[1:43:16.720 --> 1:43:24.080]  with the cell phone radio waves well you can mitigate it mitigate that now with the privacy
[1:43:24.080 --> 1:43:30.320]  pocket from info wars store dot com we've got four different colors black blue red green

[1:43:38.480 --> 1:43:48.640]  here um if i'm guessing just by sheer proximity i have to go with jib jib over here jib john
[1:43:50.080 --> 1:43:55.360]  just sheer proximity he's the closest so uh he just becomes the number one suspect
[1:43:55.360 --> 1:43:59.600]  he's laughing by the way kind of a cheshire grin there i checked his pocket i wouldn't
[1:43:59.600 --> 1:44:04.880]  be surprised maybe i should try to send him a text if it doesn't go through we'll know why
[1:44:06.000 --> 1:44:12.000]  but folks don't let google and apple and the chai comms and the government trace and track you

[1:45:44.720 --> 1:45:51.760]  but you know what i need to digress and just focus on this news so so let me try to get as much news
[1:45:51.760 --> 1:45:59.440]  out here as possible google bans ads on coronavirus conspiracy theory content ah
[1:46:01.760 --> 1:46:05.680]  of course ladies and gentlemen alphabets inks google said on friday would prohibit websites

[1:46:10.480 --> 1:46:16.880]  against scientific consensus during the coronavirus pandemic i mean just lies and lies and disinformation
[1:46:16.880 --> 1:46:22.880]  and misinformation on top of lies it's the cdc and the world health organization that's been
[1:46:22.880 --> 1:46:28.320]  spreading conspiracy theories and lies but see they get carte blanche to operate but if you call
[1:46:28.320 --> 1:46:34.560]  that out if you show the cdc scientific studies from years ago that saying mask doesn't stop the
[1:46:34.560 --> 1:46:41.360]  flu mask doesn't stop covid you're considered mis and disinformation but really all this story
[1:46:41.360 --> 1:46:50.000]  proves is that this was the entire intent this is the entire purpose for banning info wars
[1:46:52.800 --> 1:46:59.840]  over two years ago so that when they roll out their fake pandemic info wars can't be
[1:46:59.840 --> 1:47:06.720]  on the internet dominating the news spectrum so that we could get out ahead of these things
[1:47:08.320 --> 1:47:13.600]  twitter blocks tweets on china human rights abuses story as attorney general bar decries
[1:47:13.600 --> 1:47:23.200]  silicon valley collaboration with ccp yeah it's called treason it's called lock them up i mean
[1:47:23.200 --> 1:47:28.400]  you know in the old days you'd find a rope and see how long they last but ah we're a little more
[1:47:28.400 --> 1:47:32.080]  civilized now 50 years in jail for mark zuckerberg
[1:47:34.320 --> 1:47:37.360]  hey look i don't want these people yeah there is in pale face by the way
[1:47:37.920 --> 1:47:42.960]  surfboarding on his 12 000 surfboard it serves for you
[1:47:48.720 --> 1:47:54.880]  i'm sorry it's just the epitome of these people you pay for a surfboard that serves for you
[1:47:54.880 --> 1:47:59.280]  you because you're you can't do it yourself and you don't want to try to get up and get on the
[1:47:59.280 --> 1:48:06.720]  board uh with your own volition so he pays for an electronic surfboard it's like it's like
[1:48:06.720 --> 1:48:12.560]  programming a skateboard that doesn't like all the tricks for you and you just stand on it anyway
[1:48:12.560 --> 1:48:21.440]  you also have josh howley signing a memorandum against us companies that are operating in china
[1:48:21.440 --> 1:48:27.200]  using slave labor i mean this is a joke man you know and this is honestly for for all
[1:48:27.200 --> 1:48:33.200]  intensive purposes purposes the easiest way to get things moving in the right direction is to just
[1:48:33.200 --> 1:48:39.280]  outright deal with china and the american companies that collude with china now because
[1:48:40.160 --> 1:48:46.480]  you have all the ammo on your side make the liberals defend chinese slave labor make the
[1:48:46.480 --> 1:48:53.120]  liberals defend all the blacks and muslims that get murdered in china make the liberals defend the
[1:48:53.120 --> 1:49:00.480]  political dissident concentration camps make them own that stance and then you go in there
[1:49:01.520 --> 1:49:09.760]  i mean it's just so ridiculous it's just so ridiculous i uh i'm just at a loss at this point
[1:49:09.760 --> 1:49:19.200]  nfl players tweet that season might not happen you've got the nhl about to start up with no fans
[1:49:19.200 --> 1:49:24.240]  you've got the mlb about to start up with no fans and you have athletes part of those leagues saying
[1:49:24.240 --> 1:49:29.520]  you know what i'm not gonna play i'm not wearing a mask i'm not playing this stupid fake season
[1:49:29.520 --> 1:49:37.760]  in in front of no fans uh part of what's coming up will be michelle malcon she gets attacked by
[1:49:37.760 --> 1:49:44.240]  antifa and black lives matter thugs at denver back the blue rally sends law and order s os to
[1:49:44.240 --> 1:49:51.040]  president trump yeah folks it's bad now look the only excuse i'll give president trump is if he's
[1:49:51.040 --> 1:49:56.640]  actually going after the pedophiles like in a really serious way and uh if he's actually going
[1:49:56.640 --> 1:50:05.360]  after the deep state in a real serious way and uh if we see some arrests of these parties before
[1:50:05.360 --> 1:50:12.400]  his reelection otherwise this is such a dereliction of duty but in a way can you really even blame
[1:50:12.400 --> 1:50:16.960]  him i mean it really just comes down to the democrat mayors and governors that are responsible for this
[1:50:17.920 --> 1:50:23.200]  but michelle malcon pretty much sums it up in one treat right here how do we stand up when police
[1:50:23.200 --> 1:50:29.200]  obey black lives matter demands to stand down how do we back the blue when the blue won't back us
[1:50:29.200 --> 1:50:35.360]  how do we fight back like all of conneak is now preaching when conneak smears prod boys as street
[1:50:35.360 --> 1:50:40.720]  brawlers and tries to cancel people like me who defend them well look that's why i was saying this
[1:50:40.720 --> 1:50:46.960]  before i went on today the crew i can't even watch fox news anymore it's watching fox is actually
[1:50:46.960 --> 1:50:53.120]  worse than watching msnbc or cnn at this point because they pretend like they're your friends
[1:50:53.120 --> 1:50:59.440]  and they're really just the biggest grifters out there and now that tucker carlson isn't on fox news
[1:50:59.440 --> 1:51:03.440]  i don't know if he's supposed to come back from his quote on quote vacation tonight but uh boy
[1:51:03.440 --> 1:51:12.160]  without tucker carlson that news network is gone gone telling you biden's gonna win telling you
[1:51:12.160 --> 1:51:19.840]  trump is bad telling you to wear a mask having ben Shapiro on there done and i can't even watch
[1:51:19.840 --> 1:51:26.160]  fox news anymore but uh it's almost like you know it's your friend that you thought was your friend
[1:51:26.160 --> 1:51:31.600]  that was never your friend that stabs you in the back that's fox news at least i know cnn and msnbc
[1:51:31.600 --> 1:51:37.520]  aren't my friends but hey we told you we warned the president don't get in that bed they'll smother
[1:51:37.520 --> 1:51:45.600]  you americans have had freedom for so long and most americans were born into such docile times
[1:51:45.600 --> 1:51:50.560]  compared to the rest of history that we really have a blind spot for tyranny we don't appreciate
[1:51:50.560 --> 1:51:55.760]  the american way truth justice to process the right to self-defense private property because
[1:51:55.760 --> 1:52:00.000]  we've had it so long and we just think that's how the rest of the world is ladies and gentlemen
[1:52:00.000 --> 1:52:05.680]  the renaissance the social contract that's 500 years old to try to build up humanity and try
[1:52:05.680 --> 1:52:11.040]  to believe in humanity and to try to empower the weak as well as the strong is something the west
[1:52:11.040 --> 1:52:15.680]  invented and that's what made our modern world that's now been hijacked by the technocrats by
[1:52:15.680 --> 1:52:21.280]  the globalists who say humans are ugly and bad for the earth and we need to be cold and dumbed down
[1:52:21.280 --> 1:52:27.120]  and put into subgroups that the elites dominate manipulate and command you're even lucky enough
[1:52:27.120 --> 1:52:34.320]  to stay alive and that's what covet 19 is a global un revolution against free humanity against your
[1:52:34.320 --> 1:52:38.080]  family against prosperity and against your future if you don't stand up and fight you deserve what

[1:53:14.160 --> 1:53:18.320]  well we're going to make sure there's even more of these on the streets to spread the word and

[1:54:01.840 --> 1:54:09.360]  who has been putting out great content that just shows the total lunacy hypocrisy insanity
[1:54:09.360 --> 1:54:17.280]  of the progressive liberal in the year 2020 the most recent one exposes how the leftist
[1:54:18.000 --> 1:54:23.680]  the liberals the progressives are the real racists and he uses their own ideology and statements to
[1:54:23.680 --> 1:54:32.000]  prove it this is woke liberals meet racists for the first time and find out they have everything
[1:54:32.000 --> 1:54:37.520]  in common when me and brad first mad i didn't think we'd get along but turns out we kind of agree
[1:54:37.520 --> 1:54:40.960]  on everything your racial identity is the most important thing everything should be looked at
[1:54:40.960 --> 1:54:44.960]  through the lens of race jinx you owe me a coke we both have a lot of opinions about people of
[1:54:44.960 --> 1:54:49.120]  color even though we barely know any i say colored people but as long as we're classifying them we
[1:54:49.120 --> 1:54:53.280]  both think minorities are a united group we think the same and act the same and vote the same you
[1:54:53.280 --> 1:54:56.640]  don't want to lose your black card sorry i don't know i just think we should roll back discrimination
[1:54:56.640 --> 1:55:00.320]  loss so we can hire based on race against jinx now you owe me a coke hey tell them what you told
[1:55:00.320 --> 1:55:04.480]  me yesterday white actors should only do voices for white cartoon characters and say that for
[1:55:04.480 --> 1:55:09.520]  years stick to your own us white people we have so much privilege i agree it is a privilege to be white
[1:55:09.520 --> 1:55:13.760]  asking about interracial dating all i say is that black men who date white women have internalized
[1:55:13.760 --> 1:55:17.920]  racism and white men that date ethnic women are fetishizing them guys against interracial dating
[1:55:17.920 --> 1:55:21.200]  out like it might be by the way pause it right there put you up folks just so you understand this
[1:55:21.200 --> 1:55:25.440]  is a guy that they pay portray it it's a guy who's wearing a racist shirt and a guy who's wearing a
[1:55:25.440 --> 1:55:29.280]  woke shirt you find out they all have the same ideology now i just wanted to pause right there
[1:55:29.280 --> 1:55:37.040]  because i have another clip coming up that is that exact thing how how liberals are now against
[1:55:37.920 --> 1:55:42.240]  i guess interracial relationships or whatever we'll play that clip coming up but again this is a
[1:55:42.240 --> 1:55:46.880]  racist meets a woke liberal for the first time and finds out they have everything in common
[1:55:47.680 --> 1:55:51.120]  it's interracial dating now like am i being pranked did boomer put you up to this
[1:55:51.920 --> 1:55:55.600]  oh you know that taco place is white owned white people should be making white foods like
[1:55:55.600 --> 1:55:59.360]  crap macaroni and cheese no seasoning not even salt it's like he's a mind reader i mean i've
[1:55:59.360 --> 1:56:03.680]  been pushing for segregation forever and my man does what i created an impromptu comedy show
[1:56:03.680 --> 1:56:08.320]  exclusively for ethnic people i segregate comedy on my birthday white people need to stop wearing
[1:56:08.320 --> 1:56:12.640]  dreadlocks and they need to stop appropriating black people's music she has it right there by the
[1:56:12.640 --> 1:56:19.280]  way i see this is hilarious i've got another clip of that coming up as well where i will play it
[1:56:19.280 --> 1:56:24.640]  coming up in the next hour but this is unbelievable again a woke liberal meets a racist for the first
[1:56:24.640 --> 1:56:30.320]  time and finds out they have everything in common this perfectly summarizes exactly where the left
[1:56:30.320 --> 1:56:36.800]  is at on my birthday white people need to stop wearing dreadlocks and they need to stop appropriating
[1:56:36.800 --> 1:56:40.960]  black people's music shamed heads and country music the way god intended you know all white
[1:56:40.960 --> 1:56:45.520]  people are racist i'm listening even if you have a black wife or a black friend group you're still
[1:56:45.520 --> 1:56:48.800]  really racist you know he has kicked the guy out of the organization for having a black girlfriend
[1:56:48.800 --> 1:56:52.720]  but if you can promise me he's still really racist we'll consider letting him back in black people
[1:56:52.720 --> 1:56:56.960]  should only shop at black businesses i guess the only thing we really disagree about is i think white
[1:56:56.960 --> 1:57:00.320]  people are the root of all evil but what did i tell you though if we can narrow that down to a
[1:57:00.320 --> 1:57:04.880]  certain group of tiny-hearted white people i think we can come to an understanding technically i don't
[1:57:04.880 --> 1:57:13.440]  consider jewish people white either do i so there you go ryan long comedy i mean just nails it
[1:57:14.160 --> 1:57:19.360]  it just nails it by the way we've got some more comedy coming up as well that we're going to get to
[1:57:19.360 --> 1:57:24.000]  do in fact you know what let's go ahead and just let's go we can do both of them right now
[1:57:24.000 --> 1:57:29.600]  these are the two latest joe biden campaign ads first let's go to number six
[1:57:29.600 --> 1:57:41.520]  hello hello who's there hello who is this who is this i love kids jumping on my life
[1:57:42.720 --> 1:57:48.080]  what whoa whoa you will be caught you will go to prison i can get it done i can get it done quickly
[1:57:48.080 --> 1:58:01.520]  all right um and then uh let's go to another brand new joe biden campaign ad we got two more coming
[1:58:01.520 --> 1:58:19.760]  up uh joe biden's grab ass are you ready kids i can't hear you
[1:58:31.840 --> 1:58:45.680]  biden grab us we may have to sing that together as a class okay biden grab us classic
[1:58:47.840 --> 1:58:52.560]  another part of the great awakening was taking place is people that haven't even been religious
[1:58:52.560 --> 1:58:58.720]  or christian now see how evil is out in the open how hundreds of churches have been burned in europe
[1:58:58.720 --> 1:59:05.440]  and the us hundreds of christian icons have been burn destroyed jesus has had their heads cut off all
[1:59:05.440 --> 1:59:10.320]  over the country all over the philippines all over europe virgin marys are getting torn down i mean
[1:59:10.320 --> 1:59:16.000]  crosses are being torn down it's absolutely out of control but people now understand that evil was
[1:59:16.000 --> 1:59:22.560]  always real it is spiritual and it was just waiting to make its move building beneath the surface
[1:59:22.560 --> 1:59:27.120]  and now it's emerged that's why when i ask listeners and viewers for your prayer i mean it i'm praying
[1:59:27.120 --> 1:59:32.080]  for america i'm praying for you and i know the power of prayer is real and god hears it we need
[1:59:32.080 --> 1:59:37.280]  to come together and pray for an even greater awakening pray for donald trump to be protected
[1:59:37.280 --> 1:59:42.640]  pray for him to win a landslide and pray for the people under deception of the globalist to
[1:59:42.640 --> 1:59:57.440]  awaken and join us in liberty and freedom god bless you all please pray for him for us as well
[1:59:57.440 --> 2:00:07.920]  ladies and gentlemen nancy polosi just announced this morning a plan to forcibly remove president
[2:00:07.920 --> 2:00:16.000]  trump under cog that's fema martial law plans for nuclear war and other disasters like an astroid
[2:00:16.000 --> 2:00:25.120]  hitting the plan she just announced a cog briefing plan to forcibly remove president trump one way
[2:00:25.120 --> 2:00:31.280]  or another she says he's leaving and that she is second in command and will be president when you
[2:00:31.280 --> 2:00:37.280]  know the technicals that's what she actually said this is the most dangerous information ever because
[2:00:37.280 --> 2:00:43.120]  as we've told you they've been quietly preparing for this and quietly speaking to top brass getting
[2:00:43.120 --> 2:00:47.680]  them in line and telling them you'll be put in prison if you don't submit to this illegal action
[2:00:48.480 --> 2:00:56.560]  americas are under absolute attack america is under total attack and americans are under
[2:00:56.560 --> 2:01:02.560]  martial law right now with the covet 19 put in place by the bureaucracies the united nations
[2:01:02.560 --> 2:01:09.680]  and the democrats outlawed major corporations it's up to we the people to realize we're going into
[2:01:09.680 --> 2:01:15.600]  total bombing to slavery we don't wake up and say no now here is the incredible evil of anti
[2:01:15.600 --> 2:01:22.400]  polosi normalizing the deep state physically removing the president and fumigating him like
[2:01:22.400 --> 2:01:28.320]  a rodent or a cockroach hear it for yourself this isn't treason because this woman's never
[2:01:28.320 --> 2:01:33.280]  been an american she's a globalist and enemy of this country it's us or them ladies and gentlemen
[2:01:33.840 --> 2:01:39.200]  here he is the monster nancy polosi whether he knows it yet or not he will be leaving
[2:01:39.920 --> 2:01:43.920]  just because he might not want to move out of the white house doesn't mean we won't have an
[2:01:43.920 --> 2:01:51.840]  inauguration ceremony to inaugurate a duly elected president of the united states and the uh i just
[2:01:51.840 --> 2:01:59.040]  you know i'm second in line uh to the presidency and just last week i had my regular continuation
[2:01:59.040 --> 2:02:04.720]  of government briefing this might interest you because it's i say to them this is never going
[2:02:04.720 --> 2:02:10.400]  to happen god willing it never will but there is a process it has nothing to do with it the
[2:02:10.400 --> 2:02:15.600]  certain occupant of the white house doesn't feel like moving and has to be fumigated out of there
[2:02:15.600 --> 2:02:23.040]  because the presidency is the presidency it's not a geography or location i've been telling you this
[2:02:23.040 --> 2:02:29.440]  since president trump got elected in full wars has been the first and the most accurate to lay
[2:02:29.440 --> 2:02:37.120]  out the deep states plan to use continuity of government systems to forcibly remove the president
[2:02:37.120 --> 2:02:42.640]  outside of impeachment and outside of the 25th amendment now since i analyzed the propaganda
[2:02:42.640 --> 2:02:48.400]  we're putting out three and a half years ago preparing the public for this i began to again
[2:02:48.400 --> 2:02:54.800]  warn specifically for signs that they're getting ready to go operational if their impeachment
[2:02:54.800 --> 2:02:59.600]  and their russia gate and other things failed which have all failed so now they put the country into a
[2:03:00.160 --> 2:03:07.200]  type of civil war unrest they have locked it down the type of martial law with the covet 19
[2:03:07.200 --> 2:03:15.360]  so in case the american people resist they have covet 19 as the cover story to keep
[2:03:19.840 --> 2:03:24.240]  i've been telling you this since president trump got elected we're all over during this
[2:03:24.240 --> 2:03:28.320]  so we have to call the white house we have to go bullhorn the white house we have to go out
[2:03:28.320 --> 2:03:32.240]  to all the events we can and hit the streets and point out that we're aware of what's happening
[2:03:32.240 --> 2:03:36.320]  and we're aware of the election fraud and the attempt to overturn the election the attempt
[2:03:36.320 --> 2:03:40.800]  almost four years ago to not let the delegates be seated when president trump won the election i mean
[2:03:40.800 --> 2:03:45.600]  we've already witnessed ansy polosi's daughter quarterback the operation to try to get trump
[2:03:45.600 --> 2:03:49.440]  not inaugurated three and a half almost four years ago so they're doing it again but this
[2:03:49.440 --> 2:03:54.720]  time they're building teeth into it so everyone including roger stone you name it needs to contact
[2:03:54.720 --> 2:04:00.080]  trump needs to make this the front and center issue because if we sit here caught flat footed
[2:04:00.080 --> 2:04:03.760]  and don't realize they're preparing the talking points for this to then activate nationwide
[2:04:03.760 --> 2:04:08.560]  riots and say it's all trumps fault and try to drive him from office and try to have some
[2:04:08.560 --> 2:04:13.760]  group within the military physically take out the president and polosi's calling him a pest that
[2:04:13.760 --> 2:04:19.920]  has to be fumigated out like cockroaches or bed bugs this is absolutely happening this is going
[2:04:19.920 --> 2:04:24.800]  down it's unfolding and i'll just say this if we don't stand up and speak out against this
[2:04:24.800 --> 2:04:28.880]  we'll never fight when the time comes if we're forced to now is the time to be politically
[2:04:28.880 --> 2:04:33.920]  extremely vocal in however you can and to make sure the governors raise the alarm to make sure
[2:04:33.920 --> 2:04:38.320]  the legislators raise the alarm because these criminals are working with the communist chinese
[2:04:38.320 --> 2:04:42.960]  they're working with multinational corporations trying to break our borders and break the sovereignty
[2:04:42.960 --> 2:04:47.920]  and democrats are running the dollar down constantly saying it's the end of american dominance
[2:04:47.920 --> 2:04:53.920]  to be replaced with communist china this is beyond treason this is psychotic control freak behavior
[2:04:53.920 --> 2:04:59.680]  by these lunatics and we must all say no so america is now facing the greatest threat in
[2:04:59.680 --> 2:05:06.960]  its history now you just heard what polosi said we're going to play it again one more time so you
[2:05:06.960 --> 2:05:12.000]  can hear it and i'm asking all other talk show host to cover this and to research this and to raise
[2:05:12.000 --> 2:05:15.760]  the alarm it isn't about who gets the credit it's about the fact that we've been right over and over
[2:05:15.760 --> 2:05:20.320]  again and i know it sounds radical to say they're preparing this but now they're publicly saying it
[2:05:20.320 --> 2:05:24.560]  this is the coup against america they already tried to overthrow an elected president they've
[2:05:24.560 --> 2:05:28.960]  already tried to suppress the american people and censor us we've slidden already into a great
[2:05:28.960 --> 2:05:34.080]  tyranny the only thing left is trump and the american people fighting it so we have to recognize
[2:05:34.080 --> 2:05:38.400]  how much trouble we're in and say no to this now this is a maximum alert i'm asking all the info
[2:05:38.400 --> 2:05:43.680]  ourselves to make this their main focus this is the issue with 100 days out ladies and gentlemen
[2:05:43.680 --> 2:05:48.880]  the rest is up to you god bless and good luck whether he knows it yet or not he will be leaving
[2:05:48.880 --> 2:05:53.600]  uh just because he might not want to move out of the white house doesn't mean we won't have an
[2:05:53.600 --> 2:06:01.520]  inauguration ceremony to inaugurate a duly elected president of the united states and the uh i just
[2:06:01.520 --> 2:06:08.640]  you know i'm second in line uh to the presidency and just last week i had my regular continuation
[2:06:08.640 --> 2:06:14.400]  of government briefing this might interest you because it's i say to them this is never going
[2:06:14.400 --> 2:06:20.080]  to happen god willing it never will but there is a process it has nothing to do with it the
[2:06:20.080 --> 2:06:25.280]  certain occupant of the white house doesn't feel like moving and has to be fumigated out of there
[2:06:25.280 --> 2:06:32.800]  because the presidency is the presidency it's not geography or location boy i think pelosi
[2:06:32.800 --> 2:06:39.040]  must have been uh 10 shots deep when she drew her eyebrows on her forehead before that interview i
[2:06:39.040 --> 2:06:46.640]  mean my god and then you have kamala harris who's i mean is it even kamala harris i mean folks you
[2:06:46.640 --> 2:06:52.640]  want to get real conspiratorial kamala harris goes on msnbc and it's a completely different person i
[2:06:52.640 --> 2:06:57.120]  mean the voice is different the teeth are different the face is different did she have some sort of
[2:06:57.120 --> 2:07:02.240]  demonic possession did she have like some serious facial reconstructive surgery and then was back
[2:07:02.240 --> 2:07:10.160]  on tv in a week folks we are in we're in the twilight zone i mean look they already got clones
[2:07:10.160 --> 2:07:14.160]  folks they already got clones okay i'm just gonna tell you they got clones they've they've had clones
[2:07:14.880 --> 2:07:22.320]  so i'm not saying that's a clone but uh that's a damn demon so you can make up your own mind but
[2:07:22.320 --> 2:07:31.360]  you know what here's here's here's been this has honestly been trumps biggest achilles heel and i
[2:07:31.360 --> 2:07:36.080]  don't know if it's because he's been getting bad intel from people like brad parscale so maybe you
[2:07:36.080 --> 2:07:40.720]  know we could blame parscale but you know trump was the one that relied on parscale who let us all
[2:07:40.720 --> 2:07:50.080]  down the social media censorship and the internet censorship he's blown it folks he's blown it because
[2:07:50.080 --> 2:07:58.400]  here's the deal you know this audience understands what's going on but the general public doesn't
[2:07:58.400 --> 2:08:06.320]  and so when they took info wars off of youtube let's just use youtube for an example now all
[2:08:06.320 --> 2:08:12.000]  the people that are looking for information and news out there that are just clicking on whatever
[2:08:12.000 --> 2:08:20.720]  is trending or clicking on the headline that they like or whatever which we used to dominate we were
[2:08:20.720 --> 2:08:32.240]  numero uno on youtube number one when it came to live streaming news casts well we get tens of
[2:08:32.240 --> 2:08:41.840]  thousands of new people every day they've kneecapped that and so all the information that we got out
[2:08:41.840 --> 2:08:51.840]  there in the 2016 election we no longer have that capability and it's all by design and trump
[2:08:52.880 --> 2:08:59.040]  failed to act and he probably got bad advice from his campaign advisor brad parscale on it saying oh
[2:08:59.040 --> 2:09:05.360]  it's okay mr president i know the way to get that information out no it's not about you parscale
[2:09:05.360 --> 2:09:09.840]  it's about we the people that have been censored and deep platform that have been standing up for
[2:09:09.840 --> 2:09:20.640]  president trump before you major millions doing so and so yeah folks
[2:09:24.720 --> 2:09:33.680]  i just don't know man desperate times right now i just wish the average street liberal out there
[2:09:33.680 --> 2:09:40.080]  would understand how they have been completely duped but you know what in a sick way i think they
[2:09:40.080 --> 2:09:45.520]  like it because like i said this is a suicide death cult and they would gladly kill themselves if
[2:09:45.520 --> 2:09:50.240]  that bullet was going to go through our head too the people are awakening they're taking control
[2:09:50.240 --> 2:09:56.000]  of their own environment cell phones are an amazing tool really they're a super computer that's handheld
[2:09:56.000 --> 2:10:01.680]  but big tech large corporations hackers governments foreign governments the chai comms especially
[2:10:01.680 --> 2:10:07.760]  are using this to steal your data to share your data to be able to rig markets when they're able
[2:10:07.760 --> 2:10:12.880]  to scoop up billions of people's data they can actually predict on record what's going to happen
[2:10:12.880 --> 2:10:20.880]  in mass movements cutting them out of that data stream absolutely devastates their ai takeover
[2:10:20.880 --> 2:10:25.040]  in their own words they admit it show i've been selling privacy pouches and block it
[2:10:25.040 --> 2:10:28.720]  pockets and things like that for more than a decade and now the units have gotten really
[2:10:28.720 --> 2:10:33.920]  lightweight they're faraday cages they just look like a cloth envelope they work absolutely great
[2:10:33.920 --> 2:10:39.120]  and it just gives you that security to have power over your data and power over your identity

[2:14:09.520 --> 2:14:14.960]  because here's the thing you can't have a debate with them they run from any debate you ask them
[2:14:14.960 --> 2:14:21.760]  the science behind the mask they couldn't tell you and they run away they just want to be slaves
[2:14:21.760 --> 2:14:25.920]  because they want to make you a slave that's what it is folks i'm telling you this is the analogy
[2:14:27.200 --> 2:14:30.480]  they will put a millstone on your ankle and throw you into the ocean
[2:14:31.120 --> 2:14:34.480]  knowing damn well they're going to go down and drown with you because they're in a
[2:14:34.480 --> 2:14:40.480]  death suicide cult they would shoot themselves in the head if they thought that bullet would
[2:14:40.480 --> 2:14:46.240]  go through their head and kill you that's what they're doing right now they're putting the gun
[2:14:46.240 --> 2:14:52.000]  to their head and they're saying i'm gonna shoot i'm gonna shoot knowing that the bullet will go
[2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:58.400]  through their head and right through yours these are sick people we're dealing with these are sick
[2:14:58.400 --> 2:15:05.520]  demented evil spirits we're dealing with here's another example in clip two just quickly a black
[2:15:05.520 --> 2:15:12.960]  conservative shows up at the uh portland riots to try to talk some sense into the leftist hate mobs
[2:15:12.960 --> 2:15:15.200]  and uh they spit right in his face
[2:15:25.280 --> 2:15:27.840]  you know there's always this other thing too they always do the same thing to me
[2:15:27.840 --> 2:15:34.080]  and i'm not trying to be uh you know sexual here or anything but there's this weird thing
[2:15:34.080 --> 2:15:38.560]  they always come up to you if you're a guy and they say you have a they they comment on your male
[2:15:38.560 --> 2:15:47.920]  member you can hear it in this video you have a see you hear that and then they spit in his face
[2:15:47.920 --> 2:15:58.560]  folks these people are so sick they are so sick oh oh my gosh i'm sorry they're just i just it
[2:15:58.560 --> 2:16:02.880]  pains me it cripples me to see what has happened to my fellow man
[2:16:05.680 --> 2:16:09.040]  i i i'm honestly it's just it's i'm speechless man
[2:16:10.960 --> 2:16:13.280]  and they love it they get off on it
[2:16:13.280 --> 2:16:19.840]  yeah you want to know who's going to rape and murder you it's these leftists out in the streets
[2:16:22.960 --> 2:16:27.840]  sorry it's just sick but let's go to more sickness this is monica canon grant
[2:16:28.640 --> 2:16:33.360]  who by the way works for democrats and folks if you have a child listening maybe have them tune
[2:16:33.360 --> 2:16:39.760]  out right now uh just a fair warning if you have a child listening you may not want to expose them
[2:16:39.760 --> 2:16:44.800]  to this because it's just so sick and disgusting i even feel bad exposing you to this but but i'm
[2:16:44.800 --> 2:16:52.240]  going to today because i want you to see how sick and twisted and demented liberals have become
[2:16:52.240 --> 2:17:00.800]  they are an evil evil evil spirit right now it's bad it's really really bad and you heard
[2:17:00.800 --> 2:17:06.800]  in that joke video we played earlier how now liberals are against uh interracial relationships
[2:17:06.800 --> 2:17:13.440]  or marriage well let's go right to a democrat activist liberal activist who pretty much says
[2:17:13.440 --> 2:17:16.880]  that again if you have children listening you may want them to tune out this is going to get a
[2:17:16.880 --> 2:17:24.160]  little disgusting but let's go now again into the mind of one of these sick twisted evil demonic
[2:17:24.160 --> 2:17:31.200]  liberals hands off and then this heifer running against iana presley this one here with the white
[2:17:31.200 --> 2:17:38.000]  shames by the way pause it right there i mean look they're the ones that talk about body positivity
[2:17:38.000 --> 2:17:43.280]  this woman is sitting in her car by 300 pounds okay and then she makes one of some other woman
[2:17:43.280 --> 2:17:47.920]  running against iana presley calling her fat so they're about body positivity meanwhile she is
[2:17:47.920 --> 2:17:53.840]  literally sitting in her car 300 pounds with slobber and dribble all over her shirt so uh
[2:17:53.840 --> 2:17:58.960]  you know you're not one to talk there uh go ahead at some point we're gonna have to have a
[2:17:58.960 --> 2:18:02.480]  conversation with black folks who get in a relationship with white folks and then forget
[2:18:02.480 --> 2:18:07.920]  that they black we don't have to have that conversation and i know it's all nerves it's
[2:18:07.920 --> 2:18:11.920]  going to be uncomfortable but we don't have to have that conversation because if white vagina
[2:18:11.920 --> 2:18:17.440]  and white penises jeopardize your melanin then we need you to sit in the back of the classroom
[2:18:17.440 --> 2:18:21.120]  and this ain't your part of the show is don't get to talk right now now see how they're using
[2:18:21.120 --> 2:18:28.000]  melanin i'm telling you that nick canon segment i i i believe was by design i really believe it was
[2:18:28.000 --> 2:18:34.720]  by design so that they could have some sort of new empowering talking point and it's now
[2:18:34.720 --> 2:18:40.800]  their melanin and this is the same thing while you see black people call themselves king and queen
[2:18:40.800 --> 2:18:46.400]  it's a way of dominating you making you call them a king or queen uh it's all these semantical
[2:18:46.400 --> 2:18:51.600]  psychological games that they try to play on you and so now you hear this woman doing the same thing
[2:18:51.600 --> 2:18:59.440]  i mean it's just sick so so let's go back until you practice some self love know your history
[2:18:59.440 --> 2:19:03.680]  and realize where the came from this ain't your part of the show we need you to sit in the back
[2:19:04.240 --> 2:19:09.200]  so yeah telling black people to shut up understand what it is to wake up black regardless of how
[2:19:09.200 --> 2:19:14.560]  many educated game symbols you have at the end of your name regardless of how close and proximity
[2:19:14.560 --> 2:19:21.040]  you are to white supremacy regardless of how many white penises you ride and i am mad at you says
[2:19:21.040 --> 2:19:25.440]  because if you ride in that before credit score get you that house boo get your 40 acres in your
[2:19:25.440 --> 2:19:32.480]  mood listen to this don't forget the juice of nigga Haitian black man but i get it he living in
[2:19:32.480 --> 2:19:39.440]  utah he getting pink pink uncooked vagina i get it this is sick this woman belongs in a mental
[2:19:39.440 --> 2:19:45.120]  institution what i need to do though is keep your mouth shut on black shit if you ain't ready to
[2:19:45.120 --> 2:19:51.920]  pause it real quick imagine imagine this though this woman can keep her kids but if you dare refuse
[2:19:51.920 --> 2:19:56.960]  to wear a mask or go to some rally and not wear a mask or don't let your kid wear a mask cps comes
[2:19:56.960 --> 2:20:03.360]  for your kids even though the science is on your side but this sick twisted demonic liberal this
[2:20:03.360 --> 2:20:09.600]  racist woman gets to tell you that you're a racist and you can't be in an interracial relationship
[2:20:09.600 --> 2:20:14.160]  and you're not black because she decides this woman is sick but let's go back into the mind of a

[2:23:21.200 --> 2:23:27.040]  hollywood directors producers actors they wanted to meet with me and they said what is your formal
[2:23:27.040 --> 2:23:32.320]  education i said well really nothing but a few years of college they said well how are you one of the
[2:23:32.320 --> 2:23:39.200]  best science fiction or cultural writers we've ever heard the stuff you come up with is just
[2:23:39.200 --> 2:23:43.680]  unbelievable we'd like you to be in movies we'd like you to write with us we'd like you to do
[2:23:43.680 --> 2:23:48.240]  voiceovers you're just a renaissance man that folks know i was in some movies and harry sure
[2:23:48.240 --> 2:23:52.320]  makes statements like that a lot of others i'm not bragging i kept explaining to him i said
[2:23:52.880 --> 2:23:58.800]  do you understand i didn't come up with any of this i'm reading globalist mit white papers
[2:23:58.800 --> 2:24:04.240]  and futurist documents and they would just laugh me and say oh no way then i would give them the
[2:24:04.240 --> 2:24:08.880]  documents they would get very very scared you know the next time i saw them in a few months and say
[2:24:08.880 --> 2:24:14.560]  man you're right this is just topic folks i didn't make any of this up okay it's real it's real
[2:24:14.560 --> 2:24:24.560]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:24:24.560 --> 2:24:28.560]  you
[2:24:41.600 --> 2:24:42.560]  understand this
[2:24:42.560 --> 2:24:59.600]  the leftists are a product of their leaders who engage in satanic rituals human and child
[2:24:59.600 --> 2:25:06.960]  rape and sacrifice bloodlust blood rituals spirit cookings
[2:25:06.960 --> 2:25:12.880]  this is what they do for power this is what they do for fun
[2:25:15.360 --> 2:25:21.840]  they own the media they own the politicians they own the judges they own the lawyers
[2:25:23.920 --> 2:25:31.360]  and they're coming for you and your kids they're coming you ready
[2:25:31.360 --> 2:25:41.440]  you ready you ready for this evil it's coming to your doorstep folks it's coming in the name of
[2:25:41.440 --> 2:25:45.520]  liberalism it's coming in the name of tolerance it's coming in the name of black lives matter it's
[2:25:45.520 --> 2:25:54.080]  coming in the name of all the different buzzwords and phrases it's all the same thing a satanic
[2:25:54.080 --> 2:26:01.920]  death cult and they've become products of exactly what their leaders are
[2:26:04.960 --> 2:26:11.520]  so that's why you see videos like that one we just aired folks these are sick twisted demonic
[2:26:11.520 --> 2:26:12.560]  possessed people
[2:26:12.560 --> 2:26:22.320]  you know kanya west gets all this credit
[2:26:24.320 --> 2:26:29.040]  because he just tells it like it is he just says what's really on his mind
[2:26:31.360 --> 2:26:35.760]  and that's considered revolutionary so i mean i may not agree with everything kanya west says
[2:26:35.760 --> 2:26:44.720]  in fact i don't but you know what i'll give kanya west credit where it's due he's just speaking his
[2:26:44.720 --> 2:26:51.360]  mind and it's such a revolutionary act now that people see that and they're just like oh my gosh
[2:26:53.280 --> 2:26:58.160]  this is incredible i've never seen or heard anything like this because everyone's a coward
[2:26:58.160 --> 2:27:05.760]  but you know what the truth is folks
[2:27:06.400 --> 2:27:10.480]  there's a reason why kanya west said i'm not going to go all alex jones on your ass
[2:27:10.480 --> 2:27:18.480]  because he knows that's all we do here at info wars we take what's in our spirit what's in our
[2:27:18.480 --> 2:27:24.080]  soul what's in our gut what's in our mind and we just spill it out everywhere most of time in a
[2:27:24.080 --> 2:27:31.680]  complete meh in a complete mess but at least it's real at least it's genuine no filter no agenda
[2:27:33.920 --> 2:27:41.120]  no control so kanya west is just doing that now and it's just considered so revolutionary
[2:27:41.120 --> 2:27:47.040]  all the guy's doing is speaking freely that's all it is it's all it is folks speaking without fear
[2:27:47.040 --> 2:27:51.440]  speaking your mind without fear telling it your story without fear that's all it is
[2:27:51.440 --> 2:27:58.240]  so sometimes he may be a hundred percent spot on sometimes he may be a hundred percent off it
[2:27:58.240 --> 2:28:03.680]  doesn't matter he's speaking from his soul he's not worried about what people are going to say
[2:28:03.680 --> 2:28:09.760]  about him he's not worried about what people are going to write about him it goes from here
[2:28:10.320 --> 2:28:18.320]  it goes from here your heart to hear your mind to hear your tongue and everyone else
[2:28:18.320 --> 2:28:23.840]  censors themselves at every level they censor themselves from their heart to their mind and
[2:28:23.840 --> 2:28:28.640]  then they sent their censor themselves from their mind to their lips because they're cowards
[2:28:30.880 --> 2:28:35.600]  i'm not endorsing kanya west what i think is just a promotional stunt run for president
[2:28:36.400 --> 2:28:40.800]  if he's really trying to get politically involved then we'll find that out in a couple months
[2:28:40.800 --> 2:28:49.280]  but i am gonna salute kanya west for just speaking his mind now it's kind of ridiculous
[2:28:49.280 --> 2:28:53.680]  everybody wants to praise him for doing it when that's all info wars has been doing for decades but
[2:28:53.680 --> 2:29:00.880]  i'll digress now you just saw that sick demented leftist in the last video now here let's just
[2:29:00.880 --> 2:29:06.000]  roll a quick part for clip four because again folks the left i mean it's just unbelievable
[2:29:06.000 --> 2:29:12.560]  i'm telling you i'm at a loss for words how diabolical and sick and twisted and demented
[2:29:12.560 --> 2:29:20.000]  these people people have become where now everything is considered cultural appropriation it all goes
[2:29:20.000 --> 2:29:26.560]  back to that joke video woke liberals and racists are actually best friends every part of their
[2:29:26.560 --> 2:29:34.000]  ideology is the same so here's another example where a a young black girl wants to do irish
[2:29:34.000 --> 2:29:38.480]  dancing and she gets attacked by the leftist mob for cultural appropriation here she is
[2:29:41.840 --> 2:29:48.320]  people saying that i shouldn't be irish dancing because i'm black and i don't look like most irish
[2:29:48.320 --> 2:29:54.400]  dancers but i saw it for the first time at a recital and it was just the coolest thing ever to me
[2:29:55.520 --> 2:30:00.560]  you're not allowed to have fun you can't do irish dancing you're black how dare you
[2:30:00.560 --> 2:30:04.880]  the virus dancing this far all right so that's fine you can pull down the bbc report the point
[2:30:04.880 --> 2:30:11.440]  is folks it's just it's it's like a shark that gets blood and you know it's like a shark that
[2:30:11.440 --> 2:30:16.640]  smells blood or a piranha that smells blood it's just bite nash and gnarl and kill everything
[2:30:16.640 --> 2:30:24.400]  that's the left these days uh okay let's let's let's let's lighten the mood a little bit
[2:30:24.400 --> 2:30:31.680]  here's another uh joe biden campaign ad maybe the funniest one yet uh this is from
[2:30:32.400 --> 2:30:38.000]  demani mani on twitter who's who does a couple of these ones that we've aired here uh and it's
[2:30:38.000 --> 2:30:42.880]  just it's so funny because it's true so here is uh joe biden's latest campaign ad

[2:31:16.800 --> 2:31:36.080]  you do that you ain't black what is your deal huh stop stop don't you dare hang up that phone
[2:31:36.080 --> 2:31:49.600]  okay what if i wanted to you ain't black oh my god you son of a bitch i want a larger share the
[2:31:49.600 --> 2:32:01.040]  black vote than anybody you man you well i hope you ain't black now there's so much irony to that
[2:32:01.040 --> 2:32:10.000]  video one uh michael uh key i forget his full name is michael key though um who's actually a
[2:32:10.000 --> 2:32:18.480]  hardcore leftist and supports joe biden but that's his video that he shot it's just kind of a remake
[2:32:18.480 --> 2:32:24.800]  of a show he did but the funny thing is that's how every black person should be responding to joe
[2:32:24.800 --> 2:32:31.680]  biden now i'll give michael key credit he he has funny comedy he's a good actor and and that's one
[2:32:31.680 --> 2:32:38.000]  of one of those funny skits that he has there but you just put joe biden's actual statements into it
[2:32:38.000 --> 2:32:45.680]  and it fits perfectly in fact better than the original clip keegan michael key who's a joe
[2:32:45.680 --> 2:32:52.000]  biden supporter but seriously like how can that even be when joe biden tells you you ain't black
[2:32:52.000 --> 2:32:59.200]  every you you would think every black person's response would be the exact way that he responded
[2:32:59.200 --> 2:33:06.240]  in that in that um comedy video skit which is f you m effort telling me i ain't black
[2:33:08.480 --> 2:33:16.240]  but i'm telling you man the brainwashing the mind control is real it is real ladies and gentlemen
[2:33:16.240 --> 2:33:23.600]  and one of the best examples has to be death of john lewis movement
[2:33:24.960 --> 2:33:31.120]  or excuse me death of john lewis fuels movement to rename edmund pettus bridge
[2:33:31.920 --> 2:33:35.760]  paul mccartney calls for pettus bridge to be renamed after john lewis and so there's all
[2:33:35.760 --> 2:33:39.600]  kinds of claims for this out of hollywood and celebrities and the media and the democrats but
[2:33:39.600 --> 2:33:48.080]  folks before they uh change this and i would almost bet that they will on uh google plug in
[2:33:48.080 --> 2:33:52.720]  edmund pettus and let's see if they didn't change it overnight folks do you realize that
[2:33:52.720 --> 2:33:59.520]  pettus was a democrat they say oh we can't have pettus his name on a bridge he was in the kkk
[2:33:59.520 --> 2:34:07.120]  he was a grand dragon he was a wizard he was a racist bigot he was a democrat john lewis literally
[2:34:07.120 --> 2:34:20.640]  marched against the racist democrats literally and now they say change the name
[2:34:20.640 --> 2:34:25.360]  where the hell did this water come from

[2:35:21.920 --> 2:35:29.680]  with a cough got intubated and then died and as soon as i saw her face as soon as i saw the report
[2:35:29.680 --> 2:35:35.440]  i said watch it'll be innovation we know what's gonna happen it's a blue city the same story yet
[2:35:35.440 --> 2:35:41.520]  again and they say her heart gave out if you put somebody on a breathing tube with covet 19
[2:35:41.520 --> 2:35:45.600]  is a death sentence it's on record when everyone you know before they go to the hospital and get
[2:35:45.600 --> 2:35:50.640]  killed why are almost all the deaths happening in blue cities in blue states it's because they
[2:35:50.640 --> 2:35:57.040]  intubate them putting a tube in their lungs and covet 19 is causing an autoimmune response and if
[2:35:57.040 --> 2:36:03.360]  you do that with oxygen the doctors are on records saying it will kill you but all these doctors in
[2:36:03.360 --> 2:36:09.200]  blue cities and blue states follow their orders and the minute i saw this report today i knew what
[2:36:09.200 --> 2:36:16.640]  i would be reading don't end up like vicki gibbs or everyone there are a lot of reasons to get an
[2:36:16.640 --> 2:36:22.320]  alex jones plastic mask at info war store dot com you can wear them out to political events you
[2:36:22.320 --> 2:36:27.840]  can trigger it live darts but one of the biggest reasons is it's a great conversation starter
[2:36:27.840 --> 2:36:34.240]  at any costume party or at halloween but on top of that they admit that wearing these masks
[2:36:34.240 --> 2:36:39.120]  goes absolutely nothing to protect you from covet 19 or anything else it's total virtues signaling to
[2:36:39.120 --> 2:36:43.440]  show that you're prepared for the force inoculations and contact tracing of their openly
[2:36:43.440 --> 2:36:48.080]  announcing it's an active submission it's an active like putting a burqa on your head and
[2:36:48.080 --> 2:36:52.960]  bowing down but a big reason to wear these is then into stores when people ask you why you're
[2:36:52.960 --> 2:36:58.960]  wearing a halloween mask say it's just as useless as the stupid cloth mask that you're wearing and
[2:36:58.960 --> 2:37:04.800]  the m95 mask only control what's coming in not what's going out so they quote spread covet 19
[2:37:04.800 --> 2:37:09.200]  they don't protect from it so again it's a great way to throw it back at these control freaks faces

[2:42:18.640 --> 2:42:27.760]  for john louis you sick freaks me folks the irony here is unbelievable edmund pettus they want to
[2:42:27.760 --> 2:42:36.160]  change the name of the bridge because he was a kkk member and a racist edmund pettus was a democrat
[2:42:36.160 --> 2:42:43.200]  a democrat a democrat all these confederate statues they're tearing down are all democrats
[2:42:43.200 --> 2:42:50.880]  they're all democrats you're all tearing down democrat history john louis literally marched
[2:42:50.880 --> 2:43:01.600]  against the kkk members who were all democrats now you say well if john louis was marching
[2:43:01.600 --> 2:43:05.760]  against democrats why did he become a democrat folks i'll just go ahead and tell you probably
[2:43:05.760 --> 2:43:12.080]  john louis was a gay man probably blackmailed probably even maybe hung around with mlk uh
[2:43:12.080 --> 2:43:18.640]  after hours okay so probably a sacrifice but go ahead and write a story about that media matters
[2:43:18.640 --> 2:43:26.800]  i don't care uh done playing games with you we know what's going on heroic blm paint vigilani
[2:43:26.800 --> 2:43:31.040]  released by nypd he goes right back to the black lives matter and paints over it again
[2:43:31.840 --> 2:43:42.080]  and that is bevelin bd a hero la pd top shot officer sued for shooting killing man who advanced
[2:43:42.080 --> 2:43:48.000]  with a box cutter now this is going to be a big story folks because here's why so this young lady
[2:43:48.000 --> 2:43:54.720]  tony mcbride uh is kind of a instagram model type thing and she does pictures you know with
[2:43:54.720 --> 2:44:02.960]  with basically her her bra on with guns and stuff and uh is very popular and she dealt with a suspect
[2:44:02.960 --> 2:44:11.040]  and killed him shot him dead and they're now she's now being sued and this happened before
[2:44:11.040 --> 2:44:14.400]  george floyd by the way but they're just now going back and finding it so they're gonna make a big
[2:44:14.400 --> 2:44:21.360]  thing of this but here's why it's dangerous they're claiming that because she was doing modeling stuff
[2:44:21.360 --> 2:44:27.600]  with guns and doing gun videos and gun posts on instagram that that proves prior malice
[2:44:28.240 --> 2:44:33.360]  and basically they want to charge her with murder now and they're going to say oh the box cutter
[2:44:33.360 --> 2:44:40.800]  the box cutter well they claim that a box cutter is what allowed terrorists to take down the twin
[2:44:40.800 --> 2:44:49.200]  towers so is she not supposed to be afraid of a box cutter now again you know if you want to
[2:44:49.200 --> 2:44:52.640]  argue about tactics for taking someone out with a box cutter without shooting them then make
[2:44:53.440 --> 2:44:59.840]  that argument all day long but i'm telling you right now the big case here is they're gonna now
[2:44:59.840 --> 2:45:06.720]  say that if you put anything on the internet with you and a gun that's considered prior malice and
[2:45:06.720 --> 2:45:10.800]  will be used against you in court that's the precedent they're trying to set here so just be
[2:45:10.800 --> 2:45:17.280]  aware dc mayor bowser partners with chinese communist party group grants access to top
[2:45:17.280 --> 2:45:22.560]  federal building so she is a chinese communist agent she needs to be tried for treason same
[2:45:22.560 --> 2:45:26.560]  thing with gavin newson it's time to quit playing games with these people folks

[2:46:31.440 --> 2:46:41.520]  over 277 percent aclu files lawsuit against federal agents in portland oh but the aclu is
[2:46:41.520 --> 2:46:46.400]  silent on conservatives being censored the aclu is silent on all the hate crimes happening at the
[2:46:46.400 --> 2:46:51.760]  name of the left and the aclu is silent on the fact that portland is being tortured and burned
[2:46:51.760 --> 2:46:56.160]  to the ground by these terrorists oh but they don't want federal agents involved you know look
[2:46:56.160 --> 2:47:03.520]  i've said it since day one and and and i understand why people don't want to go with this uh narrative
[2:47:03.520 --> 2:47:07.600]  to just say hey just let these democrat cities burn to the ground but seriously just let them
[2:47:08.480 --> 2:47:14.320]  just let the democrat cities burn to the ground and if you're a god fearing american patriot or
[2:47:14.320 --> 2:47:18.480]  or a white person or a black person that's willing to stand up to these people you gotta just get the
[2:47:18.480 --> 2:47:23.680]  hell out i'm telling you folks just find a find a place to live outside of these democrat run cities
[2:47:23.680 --> 2:47:28.560]  and just let them burn into the ground because they already are letting them being burned to the
[2:47:28.560 --> 2:47:32.880]  ground they're just not letting you know that so they're not going to come out and tell you hey
[2:47:33.600 --> 2:47:38.000]  we've let the democrat riot terrorist mobs loose on the streets to destroy your city
[2:47:38.800 --> 2:47:44.160]  so you may want to get out of there they just say oh these are peaceful protests as people bring
[2:47:44.160 --> 2:47:49.440]  raped and murdered and shot and buildings burned down and looted and businesses you know yeah that's
[2:47:49.440 --> 2:47:58.240]  all good african migrant detained after starts fire at nante's cathedral fairfax police chief
[2:47:58.240 --> 2:48:04.640]  injured while detaining church-stabbing suspect just gets more out of control but we should cancel

[2:48:31.920 --> 2:48:38.240]  is that what do you think over under five thousand ten thousand so i mean believe me the
[2:48:38.240 --> 2:48:43.680]  founding fathers would have cleaned up these uh liberal commies within 48 hours that's probably
[2:48:43.680 --> 2:48:48.400]  why these people hate the founding fathers so much so it's just unbelievable all right when

[2:57:38.080 --> 2:57:43.440]  latest hiring from chris ray is the rope that he needed to politically hang himself uh because he
[2:57:43.440 --> 2:57:47.920]  hasn't done anything but you know what i'm just gonna say it and we'll let jayle salenti say it
[2:57:47.920 --> 2:57:54.400]  probably a little more eloquently and controlled than me president trump and all people that have
[2:57:54.400 --> 2:58:01.440]  his back and all god-fearing red-blooded proud americans this is a message to president trump
[2:58:01.440 --> 2:58:08.080]  a message to attorney general bar a message to durham if you don't start rounding these people up
[2:58:08.080 --> 2:58:15.040]  and arresting them as soon as possible more will die more will die at the hands of the leftist
[2:58:15.040 --> 2:58:20.400]  riot mobs in the streets more will die at the hands of the hit men that are hired by british
[2:58:20.400 --> 2:58:26.400]  royalty and elites in this country to hide their child rape and sacrifice just like that attempted
[2:58:26.400 --> 2:58:31.200]  hit on the judge just like jeff reyepstein in his prison cell and just like the fate that maxwell is
[2:58:31.200 --> 2:58:36.240]  sure to face if you don't start arresting these criminals immediately if you don't bring them
[2:58:36.240 --> 2:58:44.800]  in for questioning immediately more people will die so i call right now we need indictments now
[2:58:45.360 --> 2:58:51.680]  now against all gisling maxwell associates they all need to be rounded up and put in a jail
[2:58:51.680 --> 2:58:57.840]  and brought in for questioning same with all the obama associates during the spy gate russia gate
[2:58:57.840 --> 2:59:04.400]  hoax bring them all in question all of them and guess what all the violence and all the fake news
[2:59:04.400 --> 2:59:10.960]  and all the stuff that you're seeing will slowly slowly subside as the evil doers behind it all
[2:59:10.960 --> 2:59:16.800]  tell the names tell where the bodies are buried and we can finally root out this disgusting
[2:59:16.800 --> 2:59:22.160]  corruption that has been plaguing our country for decades and with that i handed over to jayle salenti
[2:59:25.120 --> 2:59:30.320]  what biden um said something about hope uh what's this campaign slogan
[2:59:32.640 --> 2:59:36.800]  i uh want to stick you with a needle and make you deader than a hammer and kill your babies i
[2:59:36.800 --> 2:59:42.880]  think it was biden 2020 about hope and and we have can't have fear we need hope in something oh yeah
[2:59:42.880 --> 2:59:48.480]  i know that's right it was biden 2020 i'm afraid that i'll forget my message i hope i don't
[2:59:51.360 --> 2:59:56.240]  now i think it was something like we don't need fear we need hope anyways another another line of
[2:59:56.240 --> 3:00:03.520]  of uh hope and change we could believe in and um so it's just more of a loser coming in there
[3:00:04.480 --> 3:00:11.920]  and what i've been saying to alex and trump isn't doing it is that he should be blaming this lockdown
[3:00:11.920 --> 3:00:18.320]  around that's destroying lives and destroying businesses all over america on the people that
[3:00:18.320 --> 3:00:26.880]  have locked down the economy as the prostitutes keep selling the covet war they're always absent
[3:00:26.880 --> 3:00:35.440]  the facts and the facts are as you well know that 50 percent of the people that have died so far
[3:00:35.440 --> 3:00:45.520]  are from eldercare homes that were suffering chronic illnesses before this and even a mainstream
[3:00:45.520 --> 3:00:54.640]  site like web md uh last week came out with the data and the facts that people that are obese
[3:00:55.520 --> 3:01:03.600]  are a much higher risk of dying from the virus than everybody else that's not chronically ill
[3:01:03.600 --> 3:01:12.800]  and that's who this is killing and they bring up like they did in california that this young 13
[3:01:12.800 --> 3:01:25.120]  year old guy might have died from the coronavirus one guy out of how many 40 million people and he's
[3:01:25.120 --> 3:01:32.080]  13 years old and he might have died and he was tested negative for covid but yet that becomes the
[3:01:32.080 --> 3:01:40.880]  big news so it's the prostitutes that are selling this fear and hysteria and if trump wants to win
[3:01:41.840 --> 3:01:48.800]  he should be calling out the people that have locked down the economy and that have destroyed the
[3:01:48.800 --> 3:02:00.000]  lives of tens of millions put millions and millions of people out of work and what we're going to see
[3:02:00.000 --> 3:02:08.960]  a rising crime like we haven't seen in a lifetime as i say when people lose everything and have nothing
[3:02:08.960 --> 3:02:16.320]  left to lose they lose it and you're seeing violent crime spiking all over the country in fact
[3:02:16.320 --> 3:02:23.360]  around the world hey you know it's not going to be a big campaign issue this year gun control
[3:02:23.360 --> 3:02:32.400]  now it's added control i mean everybody's stocking up what are they the feds are saying the fbi
[3:02:33.040 --> 3:02:41.760]  that there's like 130 something percent increase in people trying to get approval to buy weapons
[3:02:43.280 --> 3:02:49.120]  because this thing is out of control so what trump should be doing is blaming the people
[3:02:49.120 --> 3:02:57.920]  that have destroyed our economy look at the headline news that they keep ranting on about
[3:02:57.920 --> 3:03:07.600]  what's going on in florida cases of spiking cases of spiking first of all why would anybody go out
[3:03:07.600 --> 3:03:15.600]  and get tested why would you do this if you're feeling good why go get tested and the facts prove
[3:03:15.600 --> 3:03:27.600]  that what is it about i the numbers fluctuate between 99.8 percent and 99.32 percent of the
[3:03:27.600 --> 3:03:37.040]  people that get the virus recover from it and that the people that are dying from it again
[3:03:37.040 --> 3:03:46.320]  again are chronically ill and they're also suffering from pre-existing chronic conditions so going
[3:03:46.320 --> 3:03:57.040]  back to florida what do you got about 5500 people died there to date how big is the state 21 million
[3:03:57.040 --> 3:04:02.640]  people hey that's bigger than new york state isn't it new york has about 19 and a half million people
[3:04:02.640 --> 3:04:08.240]  they all bow down to clown quomo the little dictator
[3:04:10.960 --> 3:04:16.480]  how many people died in new york state about 32 500
[3:04:18.320 --> 3:04:25.120]  oh quomo the murderers sent people from hospitals that were chronically ill with the virus
[3:04:25.120 --> 3:04:36.720]  into nursing homes and that's spiked the nursing home numbers but yet it's still king quomo the
[3:04:36.720 --> 3:04:42.880]  little arrogant boy born on third base and thought he had a home run because daddy was mario and him
[3:04:42.880 --> 3:04:49.680]  and his little brother christy over there would be nobody if daddy wasn't mario you arrogant little
[3:04:49.680 --> 3:04:58.800]  boys shove it real quick up you know what and i think uh i was said to wear to shove it before with
[3:04:58.800 --> 3:05:07.200]  the uh element that he wants to give trump to the biden to shove up but they're not going after
[3:05:07.200 --> 3:05:17.760]  quomo that shows you their hypocrisy again all you keep reading is cases spiking cases spiking
[3:05:17.760 --> 3:05:25.120]  and the numbers are low again compared to when i was a youth 1957 58
[3:05:28.560 --> 3:05:37.040]  asian flu a million people died in a world population of three billion now we got what about
[3:05:37.040 --> 3:05:47.760]  600 000 dead out of a population of 7.8 billion so if you had the same equation we now have 2.6
[3:05:47.760 --> 3:05:59.520]  million people dead but those are only facts and the facts are out of the news and that's why you
[3:05:59.520 --> 3:06:07.600]  need to support info wars buy what they have to keep them going you saw what google is doing now
[3:06:08.800 --> 3:06:14.880]  if you're putting an average you're putting out information questioning the covid scam you don't
[3:06:14.880 --> 3:06:22.800]  get advertising revenue and of course you know info wars they don't like them at all so do what
[3:06:22.800 --> 3:06:28.880]  you can to support the truth this is serious this thing's going down big and it's going down hard
[3:06:30.720 --> 3:06:40.560]  we have to unite as americans to restore the constitution and the bill of rights that have
[3:06:40.560 --> 3:06:52.000]  been stolen from us by lowlife scum politicians because if we don't we're going to be living hell
[3:06:52.000 --> 3:07:01.680]  on earth the facts are in the numbers and the numbers are showing the greatest depression has
[3:07:01.680 --> 3:07:10.960]  begun you better prepare prepare prepare prevail and prosper in the times ahead we'll be back

[3:10:27.920 --> 3:10:34.880]  the cdc recently refined the risk categories of covid 19 stating that obesity was as big a risk
[3:10:35.520 --> 3:10:41.520]  for covid as having a suppressed immune system or chronic lung lung and kidney disease
[3:10:41.520 --> 3:10:48.960]  the cdc changed its bmi risk blah blah blah blah and
[3:10:51.840 --> 3:11:03.360]  it goes on to say during the 2009 h1 h n1 influenza pandemic there was a strong link
[3:11:03.360 --> 3:11:10.720]  between obesity and bad outcomes from pay for patients people with obesity were at the highest
[3:11:10.720 --> 3:11:22.480]  risks of dying during flu pandemics in the 1950s and 1960s too so there you have it just the facts

[3:38:11.440 --> 3:38:24.000]  included in the trends journal survival fight for your life in many different ways and we have
[3:38:24.000 --> 3:38:32.080]  the number one person in america that can teach you how and that's brad steiner and that's a
[3:38:32.080 --> 3:38:41.360]  special every week in the trends journal so moving on now you heard alex jones talking about
[3:38:42.480 --> 3:38:52.160]  the masks before i get to the masks i want to just talk about the stupidity and hypocrisy
[3:38:52.160 --> 3:39:01.280]  of the american media again they all bow down to king quomo the little boy born on third base
[3:39:01.280 --> 3:39:13.760]  and thought he had a home run the governor the hero they call him so yeah 32 500 deaths in new
[3:39:13.760 --> 3:39:25.760]  york and a population of 19.5 million again compared to california excuse me florida
[3:39:25.760 --> 3:39:29.120]  who they're bashing the santa's the governor for opening up the place
[3:39:31.840 --> 3:39:35.280]  and they have about like 5500 deaths
[3:39:35.280 --> 3:39:44.720]  so the united states again uh new york 32 500 compared to 5500 in florida
[3:39:46.000 --> 3:39:52.000]  but they don't mention that and now spain again where i show you freaks everywhere
[3:39:52.000 --> 3:40:06.000]  are locking their joints down spain they have 46 700 000 people in their country
[3:40:07.200 --> 3:40:17.280]  remember new york has 32 500 deaths spain 28 000 people
[3:40:17.280 --> 3:40:22.240]  what are you doing locking the joint up
[3:40:26.800 --> 3:40:36.160]  so the simple math is that spain has a 0.06 percent compared to a 1.15 percent in new york
[3:40:36.160 --> 3:40:51.920]  they where i am in ulster county over here 174 000 people 88 dead 88 out of 174 000 people
[3:40:52.640 --> 3:41:01.040]  and from one nursing home one nursing home without counting the others 22 people out of
[3:41:01.040 --> 3:41:07.040]  86 from a nursing home eldercare oh and maybe they're the dead because quomo took them out of
[3:41:07.040 --> 3:41:16.400]  the hospital and put them in there and they killed other people so going back to the masks
[3:41:16.400 --> 3:41:30.400]  it's as alex said the cdc that fraud fouchy the world health organization
[3:41:31.680 --> 3:41:40.480]  new england journal of medicine one after another one after another were writing in detail
[3:41:40.480 --> 3:41:48.080]  about the masks being basically ineffective and now in slave landia
[3:41:50.240 --> 3:41:55.120]  everybody in so many states are required to wear them i won't i don't go out
[3:41:57.920 --> 3:41:59.920]  so what's next
[3:41:59.920 --> 3:42:12.960]  you read the news as i've been reading to you about where the economy is going
[3:42:14.400 --> 3:42:25.520]  and they keep sliding in there that things will return to normal when there's a vaccination
[3:42:25.520 --> 3:42:35.680]  there's going to be a vaccine revolt they're already pushing this out that everyone should get
[3:42:35.680 --> 3:42:45.120]  vaccinated when this comes out and there's protests around the world by the way against this
[3:42:46.160 --> 3:42:48.880]  and many countries are going to force it on people
[3:42:48.880 --> 3:42:55.120]  and i believe they're going to force it on americans just like they have in new york state
[3:42:56.320 --> 3:43:00.720]  you can't send your kid to public school if they haven't been vaccinated
[3:43:03.920 --> 3:43:07.200]  you're not going to be able to get on an airplane if you haven't been vaccinated
[3:43:09.440 --> 3:43:13.760]  you won't get your driver's license if they haven't gotten vaccinated
[3:43:13.760 --> 3:43:21.040]  they're going to push this see here's what i'm saying
[3:43:26.480 --> 3:43:34.640]  this whole covid war is divided between those who want peace and those who will love war
[3:43:34.640 --> 3:43:44.240]  there's going to be a movement a political movement that's going to bring around
[3:43:45.120 --> 3:43:53.040]  the anti-vaccination people the people that believe in nature how dare you believe in nature
[3:43:53.040 --> 3:43:58.160]  oh maybe if i call it mother nature you'll believe it i call it father nature and i'd be sexist
[3:43:58.160 --> 3:44:09.760]  there's going to be a war against the people that want to keep cash and not go digital
[3:44:11.200 --> 3:44:15.440]  because they're going to ruin the economy with it and bring us into servitude
[3:44:16.320 --> 3:44:20.400]  there's going to be a war of people that don't want to wear masks and the ones that do
[3:44:20.400 --> 3:44:29.600]  it's going to be a new popularism movement and this could be a foundation for it
[3:44:32.000 --> 3:44:38.480]  because one person after another politics politics sucking the blood out of you
[3:44:39.520 --> 3:44:44.960]  sucking the life out of you with they want vaccinations and now i'm reading that the
[3:44:44.960 --> 3:44:50.640]  government the united states government they're talking about 24 billion dollar project for
[3:44:50.640 --> 3:44:56.240]  vaccinations and for people to get vaccinated that's in the united states
[3:44:58.960 --> 3:45:09.200]  again is going to be new political parties formed around something that's been destroyed
[3:45:09.200 --> 3:45:23.440]  the constitution and the bill of rights not this year but by 2024 that's my forecast
[3:45:24.480 --> 3:45:31.680]  and the covid war is going to unite the people that want to restore freedom
[3:45:31.680 --> 3:45:42.640]  unite for peace and live in liberty joy love and beauty thank you for having me on info wars
[3:45:42.640 --> 3:45:48.960]  do you care to support info wars and of course subscribe to the trends journal no other magazine
