[00:00.000 --> 00:21.000]  Another world. Another time. In the age of wonder. Another world. Another time.
[00:21.000 --> 00:32.000]  People should not be afraid of their governments. Government should be afraid of their people.
[00:32.000 --> 00:51.000]  If our government is responsible for the deaths of almost 100,000 people, is it really one of them?
[00:51.000 --> 01:13.000]  We're interrupting your regularly scheduled program to bring you this terrifying report.
[01:13.000 --> 01:29.000]  Jane, what more can you tell us about the Salomon Brothers building and its collapse?
[01:29.000 --> 01:41.000]  The sky now black with smoke in front of us just across the Tigris River here. This is shock and awe time for the population of Baghdad.
[01:41.000 --> 01:48.000]  The people you liberate will witness the honorable and decent spirit of the American military.
[01:48.000 --> 01:54.000]  Either you are with us or you are with the terrorists.
[01:54.000 --> 01:58.000]  It is a big idea. A new world order.
[01:58.000 --> 02:03.000]  I love my dad. I'd kill for him. I'd go to prison for him because I love him so much.
[02:03.000 --> 02:07.000]  I love Bill Clinton. What does that make Hillary Clinton to the Bush family?
[02:07.000 --> 02:08.000]  My sister-in-law.
[02:08.000 --> 02:14.000]  When you are subverting the power of government, that's a fundamentally dangerous thing to democracy.
[02:14.000 --> 02:16.000]  What do you think of Edward Snowden?
[02:16.000 --> 02:17.000]  I think he's a traitor.
[02:17.000 --> 02:25.000]  Obama is the one that kills the US troops if the Russians bomb any of them. Obama is the one that put them in arms way. Obama is the one using them as human shields.
[02:25.000 --> 02:29.000]  It is the most corrupt, degenerate, criminal government in American history.
[02:29.000 --> 02:33.000]  I'm here to warn people. You keep telling me to shut up. This isn't a game.
[02:38.000 --> 02:41.000]  Welcome to America. This is what we do.
[02:41.000 --> 02:48.000]  We got people that have taken your asses out in this building right now. We're armed to the teeth and we're not scared. You got that, you sons of bitches?
[02:48.000 --> 02:51.000]  In 2012, your agency was saying, quote,
[02:51.000 --> 02:57.000]  the Salafists, the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Qaeda in Iraq are the major forces driving the insurgents in Syria.
[02:57.000 --> 03:03.000]  In 2012, the US was helping coordinate arms transfers to those same groups. And why did you not stop that?
[03:03.000 --> 03:06.000]  Why didn't you come forward before? What were you waiting for?
[03:06.000 --> 03:11.000]  Well, for you, Inspector, I needed you.
[03:16.000 --> 03:22.000]  I suddenly had this feeling that everything was connected. We're all part of it.
[03:26.000 --> 03:28.000]  Are we ready for it?
[03:28.000 --> 03:35.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[03:39.000 --> 03:40.000]  Another world.
[03:40.000 --> 03:41.000]  Another time.
[03:41.000 --> 03:42.000]  Another time.
[03:42.000 --> 03:44.000]  In the age of wonder.
[03:44.000 --> 03:46.000]  In the age of wonder.
[03:49.000 --> 03:51.000]  Another world.
[03:51.000 --> 03:53.000]  Another time.
[03:54.000 --> 03:57.000]  His life was green and good.
[03:57.000 --> 04:00.000]  We endure the personal fact.
[04:00.000 --> 04:04.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the Resistance.
[04:04.000 --> 04:07.000]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[04:07.000 --> 04:09.000]  Broadcasting worldwide.
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[04:13.000 --> 04:17.000]  I've got the goods on the enemy and I am ready to go loaded for bear.
[04:17.000 --> 04:22.000]  Like a champion race horse with the gates about to open.
[04:22.000 --> 04:25.000]  We got a lot of big gas and key intel today.
[04:25.000 --> 04:27.000]  Laura Lummer joins us.
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  She can put on a red flag list with no criminal record.
[04:29.000 --> 04:32.000]  Democrats announced basically all Trump supporters will have their guns taken.
[04:32.000 --> 04:34.000]  Anthony Cumi is going to be joining us.
[04:34.000 --> 04:38.000]  And a lot of other expert guests here on the broadcast.
[04:38.000 --> 04:43.000]  Gregory Manorino, John Rappaport and so much more.
[04:43.000 --> 04:48.000]  But when we return, I'm going to lay out the most critical evidence yet of COVID-19
[04:48.000 --> 04:53.000]  being a globalist fraud based takeover plan and how we can stop it.
[04:53.000 --> 04:55.000]  So much more straight ahead.
[04:59.000 --> 05:06.000]  Info Wars is a archetypal, classic example of free, independent, organic resistance against tyranny.
[05:06.000 --> 05:08.000]  You built Info Wars.
[05:08.000 --> 05:10.000]  You spread the word.
[05:10.000 --> 05:11.000]  You prayed for us.
[05:11.000 --> 05:12.000]  You bought the products.
[05:12.000 --> 05:13.000]  You called in.
[05:13.000 --> 05:15.000]  You made recommendations.
[05:15.000 --> 05:17.000]  Info Wars is as much yours as it is mine.
[05:17.000 --> 05:23.000]  And that's why the enemy is so upset that under the de-platforming, under all the DNC lawsuits,
[05:23.000 --> 05:28.000]  under all the attack, in many ways, we become stronger with band.video, redesigned Info Wars
[05:28.000 --> 05:35.000]  with all of our great crew, with documentary films and 10 hours of live radio and TV a day.
[05:35.000 --> 05:37.000]  We are the resistance.
[05:37.000 --> 05:38.000]  You are the resistance.
[05:38.000 --> 05:43.000]  So remember this arsenal of freedom is waiting for you to continue to spread the word about it
[05:43.000 --> 05:47.000]  and to continue for you to support because this is something we built together.
[05:47.000 --> 05:49.000]  It's not just a national treasure.
[05:49.000 --> 05:53.000]  It's a treasure worldwide against the tyrants and they know it and they can't stand it.
[05:53.000 --> 05:57.000]  And as everything we talked about comes true, our credibility only goes up together.
[05:57.000 --> 06:14.000]  So I salute you all.
[06:14.000 --> 06:32.000]  We are seeing the rise of the globalist AI takeover system designed to replace humanity
[06:32.000 --> 06:39.000]  because we are obsolescent, obsolete, non-essential.
[06:39.000 --> 06:41.000]  What a time to be alive.
[06:41.000 --> 06:44.000]  All right, we have four guests joining us today.
[06:44.000 --> 06:46.000]  I'll be getting to that in a moment.
[06:46.000 --> 06:49.000]  But let me just dig right into the news headline stacks.
[06:49.000 --> 06:54.000]  Major scientific reports on top of major scientific reports from major scientific institutions
[06:54.000 --> 06:59.000]  confirming what was even in the New York Times last year of all places
[06:59.000 --> 07:07.000]  that only 6% of people that died supposedly of COVID-19 died from COVID-19.
[07:07.000 --> 07:12.000]  Remember they told you a 2, 3, 4% death rate? It isn't even one tenth of 1%.
[07:12.000 --> 07:15.000]  Remember they told you all those lies?
[07:15.000 --> 07:20.000]  Well, now it's all coming out CDC busted inflating COVID numbers
[07:20.000 --> 07:22.000]  accused of violating federal law.
[07:22.000 --> 07:27.000]  I've got all the data, all the CDC's own numbers right here for you.
[07:27.000 --> 07:31.000]  And we've got all the latest as the scam unfolds.
[07:31.000 --> 07:36.000]  But remember top pathologists last year came out and said coronavirus is the greatest folks ever perpetrated
[07:36.000 --> 07:38.000]  on the unsuspecting public.
[07:38.000 --> 07:44.000]  That is all coming up as well and it all ties together.
[07:44.000 --> 07:48.000]  Meanwhile, we have Town Hall asking the same question I've been asking
[07:48.000 --> 07:52.000]  and Tucker Carlson's been asking and so many others have been asking.
[07:52.000 --> 07:58.000]  Why is the National Guard still in Washington and why are the numbers increasing?
[07:58.000 --> 08:03.000]  Oh, they say it's in case Trump tries to escape during the impeachment trial
[08:03.000 --> 08:08.000]  when even they admit they don't have the votes to actually convicting.
[08:08.000 --> 08:11.000]  And they're saying this is really part of a symbol of their power.
[08:11.000 --> 08:13.000]  That's what MSNBC says.
[08:13.000 --> 08:17.000]  So going to direct authoritarianism, we have some really good news
[08:17.000 --> 08:21.000]  and a special report that's up on Bandot video that we shot last night
[08:21.000 --> 08:26.000]  showing the best highlights of his press conference that will play next segment.
[08:26.000 --> 08:30.000]  Florida Governor Ron DeSantis does what Trump didn't do
[08:30.000 --> 08:34.000]  and counters what the Democrats are trying to do.
[08:34.000 --> 08:38.000]  Ron DeSantis launches ambitious crackdown on big tech
[08:38.000 --> 08:44.000]  and we've got a bullet point layout of that coming up for you next segment.
[08:44.000 --> 08:47.000]  Also, FBI confirms two agents killed,
[08:47.000 --> 08:50.000]  three wounded and suspected child porn raid in Florida
[08:50.000 --> 08:53.000]  but you won't see that in the national news.
[08:53.000 --> 08:58.000]  You'll only hear the fifth person in U.S. history laid in state at the Capitol,
[08:58.000 --> 09:01.000]  killed by rioters, not true,
[09:01.000 --> 09:05.000]  so that they can try to act like this was the greatest attack since Pearl Harbor
[09:05.000 --> 09:09.000]  and using the sad heart attack slash stroke death of a police officer
[09:09.000 --> 09:12.000]  days after the event as the pretext of claim,
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.000]  it was the bloodiest attack in U.S. history, which it was not.
[09:15.000 --> 09:18.000]  It paled in significance even compared to football riots
[09:18.000 --> 09:20.000]  but people saw the hundreds of thousands outside
[09:20.000 --> 09:23.000]  and equated that with that number attacking
[09:23.000 --> 09:26.000]  a very primitive level, a big crowd of people scary.
[09:26.000 --> 09:30.000]  And then the idea of all of them attacking is very scary,
[09:30.000 --> 09:33.000]  should be scary to tyrants, but they weren't.
[09:33.000 --> 09:36.000]  So they're projecting that, but careful what they project,
[09:36.000 --> 09:41.000]  careful what they wish for, they might someday actually get the real thing
[09:41.000 --> 09:44.000]  and not the thing that they provocative and made up.
[09:44.000 --> 09:49.000]  Also, SpaceX Starship explodes during high altitude test,
[09:49.000 --> 09:55.000]  we're going to get to that actually first here in just a moment during this segment
[09:55.000 --> 10:01.000]  and more on the sham impeachment trial, the entire proceeding is legally no.
[10:01.000 --> 10:02.000]  It's not real.
[10:02.000 --> 10:04.000]  It's why the Chief Justice Roberts won't be part of it
[10:04.000 --> 10:09.000]  because it's in the Constitution, you can't try a person after they're out of office
[10:09.000 --> 10:10.000]  for impeachment.
[10:10.000 --> 10:11.000]  Who was the British King?
[10:11.000 --> 10:16.000]  Something like 20 years after he died, they dug up his body and chopped his head off.
[10:16.000 --> 10:20.000]  I mean, it's kind of the same, same type deal.
[10:20.000 --> 10:25.000]  But the first thing I want to hit is the inbred hatred of America
[10:25.000 --> 10:28.000]  and the hatred of our military and the hatred of our superiority
[10:28.000 --> 10:35.000]  and the hatred of our technology by the envious leftist Hollywood trash class
[10:35.000 --> 10:37.000]  that everyone's trying to run away from.
[10:37.000 --> 10:43.000]  So the operative that runs the White House, basically for Barack Obama,
[10:43.000 --> 10:50.000]  Ms. Saki, was making fun of Space Force yesterday as if it's a joke and non-existent.
[10:50.000 --> 10:56.000]  All that is is a name for a 60 year secret space program that's highly advanced.
[10:56.000 --> 11:01.000]  In the 1970s, there were weapons platforms in space,
[11:01.000 --> 11:07.000]  robotically controlled with Sabo DU rounds in them that could decapitate
[11:07.000 --> 11:13.000]  the entire world leadership of over 100 countries in a matter of hours.
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.000]  By 1979, the United States had a complete decapitation weapons platform,
[11:17.000 --> 11:24.000]  more than 20 platforms in space with meteor guns is the classic parlance for it,
[11:24.000 --> 11:31.000]  but it's really a accelerated Sabo high energy, tenetic weapon.
[11:31.000 --> 11:34.000]  And it's roughly, depending on the system, it was classified,
[11:34.000 --> 11:37.000]  they leaked some of it so the guy that ran the program, before he died,
[11:37.000 --> 11:39.000]  Colonel Bob Bum was able to tell me about it.
[11:39.000 --> 11:42.000]  They've had some hearings in Congress admitting it's about a 100 pound Sabo.
[11:42.000 --> 11:44.000]  It's got a rocket engine on it.
[11:44.000 --> 11:47.000]  It aims from space at whatever target it's going to hit.
[11:47.000 --> 11:53.000]  It fires in the Plenty Uranium round and it hits with so much force at 30,000 miles an hour
[11:53.000 --> 11:57.000]  on the ground that it'll kill people in a bunker two miles under a mountain.
[11:57.000 --> 12:00.000]  They're always under mountains because you dig two miles under the dirt,
[12:00.000 --> 12:02.000]  it's 150 degrees.
[12:02.000 --> 12:04.000]  Under a mountain, so you've got a two or three mile tall mountain,
[12:04.000 --> 12:09.000]  you put the base of the mountain, a little bit of inside baseball.
[12:09.000 --> 12:14.000]  So in 1979, there were all these platforms of global domination already in space.
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.000]  Trump is just bringing out what was secret and Saki makes a joke about it
[12:19.000 --> 12:24.000]  because CNN ABC News says America's done, America's a wimp, America's a joke,
[12:24.000 --> 12:26.000]  China's the dominant power.
[12:26.000 --> 12:29.000]  They're running us down so all the investment moves to China.
[12:29.000 --> 12:31.000]  They're telling us that America's not open for business.
[12:31.000 --> 12:37.000]  And then they want the world to not know that America gained military superiority by 1980.
[12:37.000 --> 12:42.000]  And that's why the Russians figured it out later and gave up officially in 1991
[12:42.000 --> 12:44.000]  but gave up way before that in the mid-1980s.
[12:44.000 --> 12:46.000]  By the way, they put a bunch of weapons in space.
[12:46.000 --> 12:50.000]  But we sent a hundred killer satellites up there and destroyed them.
[12:50.000 --> 12:52.000]  And the Chinese are using particle beams on the ground.
[12:52.000 --> 12:53.000]  They blow up a lot of our stuff.
[12:53.000 --> 12:55.000]  There's a space war going on for a long time.
[12:55.000 --> 12:56.000]  It's ongoing.
[12:56.000 --> 12:57.000]  And it comes out here, it comes out there.
[12:57.000 --> 13:03.000]  But this woman is so ignorant and so stupid and such a Harvard bug-eyed moron
[13:03.000 --> 13:05.000]  that she doesn't know any of it.
[13:05.000 --> 13:08.000]  And of course we're attacking Elon Musk because another rocket blew up.
[13:08.000 --> 13:11.000]  Yeah, well it took NASA a hundred rockets before they got stuff with the Saturn
[13:11.000 --> 13:14.000]  that got into the Saturn rocket that got into space.
[13:14.000 --> 13:17.000]  Musk only has a couple explosions before he got his heavy Falcon into space.
[13:17.000 --> 13:19.000]  Better than the Russians, better than what the U.S. had.
[13:19.000 --> 13:21.000]  So again, they don't like trial and error.
[13:21.000 --> 13:23.000]  They don't like America learning.
[13:23.000 --> 13:24.000]  They don't like any of it.
[13:24.000 --> 13:26.000]  They want us done.
[13:26.000 --> 13:27.000]  They want us to be a joke.
[13:27.000 --> 13:30.000]  Biden's trying to shut down SpaceX right now because, quote,
[13:30.000 --> 13:34.000]  Elon Musk is discriminating against foreign workers, which is even pure bull.
[13:34.000 --> 13:35.000]  Anything he hires too many.
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  But he gets the job done.
[13:37.000 --> 13:42.000]  So let's go ahead and go to this lady attacking Space Force, of which she knows nothing.
[13:42.000 --> 13:45.000]  Them to also engage with on some of those questions,
[13:45.000 --> 13:49.000]  but there is more the president will have to share on refugees and other issues soon.
[13:49.000 --> 13:55.000]  May I ask whether the president has made a decision on keeping or keeping the scope of Space Force?
[13:55.000 --> 13:57.000]  Wow, Space Force.
[13:57.000 --> 13:59.000]  It's the plane of today.
[13:59.000 --> 14:02.000]  It is an interesting question.
[14:02.000 --> 14:07.000]  I am happy to check with our Space Force point of contact.
[14:07.000 --> 14:08.000]  I'm not sure that is.
[14:08.000 --> 14:11.000]  I will find out and see if we have any update on that.
[14:11.000 --> 14:12.000]  Go ahead.
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  Yeah, there's no Space Force folks.
[14:21.000 --> 14:22.000]  There's no rockets.
[14:22.000 --> 14:24.000]  There's no spaceships.
[14:24.000 --> 14:31.000]  Werner von Braun in the 30s designed the space shuttle when he was in Nazi Germany that we then developed in the 70s and launched to the 80s.
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  But according to them, none of this exists.
[14:33.000 --> 14:34.000]  No, no.
[14:34.000 --> 14:39.000]  The Nazis were just firing missiles a thousand miles in 1945, but there's no technology.
[14:39.000 --> 14:44.000]  There's no nothing for kind of like there's mothers and fathers.
[14:44.000 --> 14:46.000]  No, they don't exist either, according to her.
[14:46.000 --> 14:48.000]  These people are a joke.
[14:48.000 --> 14:57.000]  And now Biden's FAA wants to shut down SpaceX, our best space program, because they are enemies of everything pro-human.
[14:57.000 --> 14:59.000]  The globalists don't want us to get off world.
[14:59.000 --> 15:05.000]  They want to expunge humanity and merge with machines and become this new AI God we're constantly being told about.
[15:05.000 --> 15:07.000]  These are crazy people.
[15:07.000 --> 15:11.000]  Or they're actually in contact with interdimensional extraterrestrials and they've made a deal.
[15:11.000 --> 15:17.000]  I don't know whether they're crazy or they've made a deal, but they believe they've made a deal with entities.
[15:17.000 --> 15:20.000]  And that, my friends, is the rest of the story.
[15:20.000 --> 15:23.000]  I can assure you, you've seen Eon Musk talk about that in the establishment.
[15:23.000 --> 15:25.000]  That's because he knows what's going on.
[15:25.000 --> 15:32.000]  He said, beware of those that worship AI gods.
[15:32.000 --> 15:35.000]  There's the headline, will Biden's administration slow down SpaceX?
[15:35.000 --> 15:41.000]  Well, they're sure trying, because the Chinese are still trying to get running water and electricity.
[15:41.000 --> 15:44.000]  And the Islamists are still learning how to use toilet paper.
[15:44.000 --> 15:47.000]  But America sucks, doesn't it? That's why everybody wants to get in here.
[15:47.000 --> 15:50.000]  We'll be right back. I'm Alex Jones. This is the Info War.
[15:50.000 --> 15:57.000]  InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, Band.Video, Tomorrow's News, Today, Today, Today.
[15:57.000 --> 16:01.000]  I love the Patriot Blend Wake Up America coffee.
[16:01.000 --> 16:04.000]  I just love it. I can't get enough of it.
[16:04.000 --> 16:07.000]  We've got a fresh brew right now.
[16:07.000 --> 16:11.000]  That's what fills my mug. That's what fills my belly. That's what fills my soul.
[16:11.000 --> 16:17.000]  Wake Up America Patriot Blend coffee. Folks, we have had this coffee for years at InfoWars.com.
[16:17.000 --> 16:20.000]  Years. Never raised the price. Never.
[16:20.000 --> 16:25.000]  The Wake Up America Blend, the best coffee. The crew here loves it. We drink it every day.
[16:25.000 --> 16:29.000]  And of course, that's just one of the great ways you can support InfoWars here.
[16:29.000 --> 16:32.000]  Everybody drinks coffee, or just about everybody.
[16:32.000 --> 16:37.000]  Why not support InfoWars and keep the coffee supply at your house with the Wake Up America Patriot Blend?
[16:37.000 --> 16:41.000]  Of course, read all the great reviews. Pretty much perfect review there. 4.9 star.
[16:41.000 --> 16:47.000]  When you have thousands of reviews, it's impossible to have a perfect review unless literally everybody gives it 5 stars.
[16:47.000 --> 16:51.000]  So, I mean, if you have 4.9, that's pretty much everybody who gives it 5 stars, except maybe one or two people.
[16:51.000 --> 16:57.000]  Patriot Blend 100% Organic Coffee, only available at InfoWars.com.
[16:59.000 --> 17:04.000]  We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply. Secure your own safe source of food supply sale.
[17:04.000 --> 17:10.000]  It's the new prices in 2021, but it's the lowest price for high-quality food you're going to find at InfoWarsStore.com.
[17:10.000 --> 17:16.000]  The subsection is prepared with Alex.com. And as all these globalists do this, and as they hoard the food and as they prepare,
[17:16.000 --> 17:20.000]  you need to understand that you need 25-year food supply in the last 25 years.
[17:20.000 --> 17:24.000]  One month, three months, six months, one-year supplies, and it's the highest quality you're going to find.
[17:24.000 --> 17:30.000]  And it's just good to have that checkbox taken care of, and you know you're getting good food at a very good price.
[17:30.000 --> 17:35.000]  And you know that a small percentage of it, because there's not much profit in this, goes to us to fund our operation.
[17:35.000 --> 17:42.000]  So, prepare at Alex.com or InfoWarsStore.com. You can find the preparedness section there, water filtration, air filtration.
[17:42.000 --> 17:46.000]  It's all there. The technocrats are getting ready to bring in all the forced GMO and more.
[17:46.000 --> 17:50.000]  It's time to start getting prepared. It starts with self-defense. It starts with being prepared.
[17:50.000 --> 18:00.000]  It starts with horrible food. It starts with digging in with a long, globalist fight. You'll win in the end.
[18:00.000 --> 18:08.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[18:08.000 --> 18:24.000]  And we are back in the fight! Woo! Not giving up, not rolling over to the New World Order.
[18:24.000 --> 18:30.000]  The New World Order is as popular as a flamethrower in hell. It's useless.
[18:30.000 --> 18:38.000]  Freedom is as popular as iced tea in the Sahara Desert, baby, and a nice jeep to get you the hell out of there with air conditioning.
[18:38.000 --> 18:41.000]  So, we're going to win in the end.
[18:41.000 --> 18:48.000]  Remember, everything the globalists bring you is pain, is being alone, is being dumbed down.
[18:48.000 --> 18:55.000]  Everything their social media, everything they do is designed to carry that information out.
[18:55.000 --> 19:13.000]  And I've got the holy grail of information to destroy and expose the COVID fraud in triplicate here that I'm going to be covering in the last segment of this hour, right here.
[19:13.000 --> 19:20.000]  All ties together. But let's shift gears to something that ties to that as well.
[19:20.000 --> 19:25.000]  I like Governor Ron DeSantis. He says that COVID's an overblown hoax.
[19:25.000 --> 19:35.000]  He exposed it in a state where they had hundreds of clinics with thousands of tests a day, 100% positive, and it was all a fraud.
[19:35.000 --> 19:42.000]  He's been fighting back against the leftist, against their fear-mongering, and he's also come out and did something Trump didn't do.
[19:42.000 --> 19:51.000]  When I begged him, and Laura Loomer begged him, please, before it's too late, before they silence you, before they steal the midterms and the general election, please move against big tech.
[19:51.000 --> 20:00.000]  And he's done it now. Mandatory opt-outs for big tech content filters and solutions to tech censorship.
[20:00.000 --> 20:05.000]  Private right of action for Florida citizens against tech companies that violate the condition.
[20:05.000 --> 20:14.000]  Finds of 100,000 per day, he's copying Poland, levied on tech companies that suspend candidates for elected office in Florida from their platforms.
[20:14.000 --> 20:16.000]  That is total election meddling.
[20:16.000 --> 20:27.000]  Daily finds for any tech company that uses the content and user-related algorithms to suppress or prioritize the access of any content related to a political candidate or cause on the ballot.
[20:27.000 --> 20:31.000]  He's fighting back against the racketeering and election meddling.
[20:31.000 --> 20:39.000]  Greater transparency requirements, disclosed requirements enforced by Florida's election authorities for tech companies that favor one candidate over the other.
[20:39.000 --> 20:47.000]  Power for the Florida Attorney General to bring cases against tech companies that violate these conditions under the state's unfair and deceptive trade practices.
[20:47.000 --> 20:50.000]  Which it is. Absolutely.
[20:50.000 --> 20:52.000]  It's the surveillance. It's the racketeering.
[20:52.000 --> 21:01.000]  It's the letting Southern Prairie Law Center and ADL by the hundreds of thousands of trainees into your private accounts to read your private text messages.
[21:01.000 --> 21:05.000]  They admit it all. And now they're turning the apps on and listening to you.
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.000]  Mainstream news. I told you years ago.
[21:07.000 --> 21:10.000]  Because it was in the patents. Now they admit it.
[21:10.000 --> 21:18.000]  They are just raping us. And we've got to wake up out of the trance and say, did we ask for big tech to have us bent over running a train on us?
[21:18.000 --> 21:22.000]  I'm sorry to use an allegory like that, but that's what's happening. And that's what's going on.
[21:22.000 --> 21:27.000]  So DeSantis is fighting the COVID fraud. He is fighting the big tech censorship.
[21:27.000 --> 21:34.000]  And this is the model. I wish our governor was like this in Texas, but he's on the big tech payroll now.
[21:34.000 --> 21:36.000]  So sad to watch that happen.
[21:36.000 --> 21:40.000]  So DeSantis is a real champion.
[21:40.000 --> 21:43.000]  Trump should have taken action like this previously.
[21:43.000 --> 21:48.000]  But wow, this is an incredible time to be alive. That puts him in the front runner seat for 2024.
[21:48.000 --> 21:51.000]  But we don't have time to waste because the lockdown is killing the economy.
[21:51.000 --> 21:58.000]  Here is part of what Governor DeSantis said in a 45 minute press conference yesterday that's at infowars.com.
[21:58.000 --> 22:03.000]  What began as a group of upstart technology companies from the West Coast,
[22:03.000 --> 22:13.000]  since transformed into an industry of monopoly communications platforms that monitor, influence, and control the flow of information in our country and among our citizens.
[22:13.000 --> 22:17.000]  And they do that to an extent hitherto unimaginable.
[22:17.000 --> 22:27.000]  At the turn of the 21st century, online technology represented tools to liberate Americans from reliance on distrusted legacy media outlets.
[22:27.000 --> 22:37.000]  As social media proliferated over the past decade, citizens could directly connect with large numbers of people and could cut out corporate media outlets entirely.
[22:37.000 --> 22:47.000]  Over the years, however, these platforms have changed from neutral platforms that provided Americans with the freedom to speak to enforcers of preferred narratives.
[22:47.000 --> 22:58.000]  Consequently, these platforms have played an increasingly decisive role in elections and have negatively impacted Americans who dissent from orthodoxies favored by the big tech cartel.
[22:58.000 --> 23:06.000]  We have seen the power of their censorship over individuals and organizations, including what I believe is clear viewpoint discrimination.
[23:06.000 --> 23:14.000]  And as these companies have grown and their influence expanded, big tech has come to look more like big brother with each passing day.
[23:14.000 --> 23:21.000]  But this is 2021, not 1984. And this is real life, not George Orwell's fiction.
[23:21.000 --> 23:27.000]  No group of people should exercise such power, especially not tech billionaires in Northern California.
[23:27.000 --> 23:35.000]  Now, if I had to choose, I'd rather be governed by the first 50 names in the Tallahassee phone book than the CEOs of big tech companies.
[23:35.000 --> 23:50.000]  If you don't like parlor, then don't read it. Let's not have those choices made for us. Or before long, we will have nothing more than someone else's choices imposed upon us by a bunch of monopolies whose core business is to sell advertising.
[23:50.000 --> 24:01.000]  And I'm committed to addressing what may be one of the most pervasive threats to American self government in the 21st century, because I believe in individual rights, privacy rights and property rights.
[24:01.000 --> 24:14.000]  Because I trust Floridians to choose which content to consume and which to ignore, because I want to preserve Florida's rich diverse public discourse and not allow corporate own narrative approved outlets to dominate our voices.
[24:14.000 --> 24:27.000]  Florida consumers deserve protection for their privacy. With the help of our legislative partners, we're going to stand together in support of Floridians and put a stop to big tech's practice of preying on consumers.
[24:27.000 --> 24:42.000]  Your privacy is important. Hunter Biden's story was true. Okay, we now know was true. And the typical corporate media outlets, they just chose to ignore it. Obviously they wanted to beat Trump.
[24:42.000 --> 24:55.000]  They had a view on the election. They didn't want to give it any air. So we rely on social media to go around that, not let corporate legacy media outlets control the discourse and let us speak.
[24:55.000 --> 25:02.000]  So you had the New York Post to run it and you couldn't get any traction. You couldn't get any reach on it because big tech put their thumb on the scale.
[25:02.000 --> 25:12.000]  So that was true. What they said at the time, oh, it was it was it's a conspiracy or it's based on on hacked information. Are you kidding me?
[25:12.000 --> 25:21.000]  You're trying to tell me if there was hacked information that could damage me. You guys wouldn't print it. Give me a break. You can whiz on my leg, but don't tell me it's raining.
[25:21.000 --> 25:34.000]  Wow. I watched the whole press conference last night. Again, it's on info wars.com. In fact, in case they take it off YouTube posts, because they do that to like presidents now, senators, anything powerful, they take down.
[25:34.000 --> 25:43.000]  Let's post that demand on video in the band video section because I bet dollars to donuts. They end up banning that speech because he lays it all out. They're doing it mass.
[25:43.000 --> 25:54.000]  Remember just a year ago, they went, oh, we're not censoring anyone. Now they go, well, yes, we're censoring everybody for your own good. And CNN goes, well, it's a good to take Tucker Carlson off the air and Alex Jones.
[25:54.000 --> 25:59.000]  So these people are just making a major move. Oh, I guess it's already up on band video.
[25:59.000 --> 26:08.000]  Governor DeSantis lays out plan to crack down a big tech cartel. Oh, no, that's my how long is the video? Let me see. Put the cursor over it for me please.
[26:08.000 --> 26:13.000]  Yeah, no, that's no, that is the full speech. Well, great job team.
[26:13.000 --> 26:20.000]  That's special reports. They're all ready. That's why I love Rob do. I mean, he just always like does something before I even ask him to do it.
[26:20.000 --> 26:29.000]  He always goes that extra mile because he knows these people are screwing over him and his family and Rob Ruppert to like, I was up to like six last night and shooting that report.
[26:29.000 --> 26:34.000]  I guess he stayed up here even longer and put that up. So great job doing that. But let's share it now, folks. Let's share it.
[26:34.000 --> 26:39.000]  We have to build our own networks to get around the sensors. Facebook, Twitter, Google, they're all blogging everything.
[26:39.000 --> 26:48.000]  But we have our own base. Band.video.com.video. And they banned that URL on Twitter and Facebook.
[26:48.000 --> 26:55.000]  So we have one they've had banned yet. It's can't censor the truth. One word can't censor the truth.com. We'll be right back.
[26:55.000 --> 27:07.000]  Anybody listening to my voice and simply search engine the term Davos group technocracy or technocrats, you will get Clash mob and Sean Cod,
[27:07.000 --> 27:15.000]  younger and all the new world order globalist like Gigi Pink saying that they no longer want elected leaders over governments,
[27:15.000 --> 27:25.000]  but they want businessmen technocrats over it. And that's who Clash mob is. You might want to look into the guy that says they've launched the COVID-19 lockdowns to bankrupt you and make you poor.
[27:25.000 --> 27:34.000]  You might want to find out who this supervillain is. You see, he believes because he's hidden playing you and you're not speaking out against it that he has the right to do it.
[27:34.000 --> 27:42.000]  You might want to find out who he works for. He works directly for Prince Charles. He developed since the 80s the plan for global sustainability.
[27:42.000 --> 27:51.000]  That means worldwide neo feudalism in his own words. So you might want to find out how he talks about using vaccines to sterilize you before you take those shots.
[27:51.000 --> 28:13.000]  You might just want to find out who this villain is. All right.
[28:21.000 --> 28:30.000]  So this month we launched a new URL before they banned it, but Soros and Bill Gates and the globalists are on our tail.
[28:30.000 --> 28:41.000]  But the new website is the resistance.video. The resistance.video. They're trying to block us because the truth is powerful and can defeat them.
[28:41.000 --> 28:56.000]  So the new URL that links right to banned.video and all of our videos and all of our documentaries and all the special reports and all the suppressed information is that the resistance.video. Share the link. The resistance.video. The resistance.video.
[29:12.000 --> 29:24.000]  According to ancient Samoan legend, Kava was given as a gift by the sun god Tagaloa, who they considered to be the supreme ruler and creator of the universe.
[29:24.000 --> 29:35.000]  The Samoan people would drink Kava tea during social gatherings and sacred ceremonies to loosen up a little. Nowadays Kava is used around the world by many who enjoy its serious benefits.
[29:35.000 --> 29:48.000]  The new Kava Chill by Dr. Jones Naturals contains a full blend of not only Kava Kava, but other herbs, including, but not limited to, German Comma Mill, Organic Skull Cap, and Balarian Root.
[29:48.000 --> 30:06.000]  We do expect to sell this new product quickly, so be sure to secure yours by visiting infowarstore.com.
[30:18.000 --> 30:44.000]  It was two and a half years ago that I was sitting there in the House Committee overseeing telecommunications and all the different censorship that was taking place.
[30:44.000 --> 30:55.000]  And there they were in the committees talking about Alex Jones, talking about Laura Loomer, talking about Donald Trump, and saying, oh, we silenced somebody. That's not censorship.
[30:55.000 --> 31:04.000]  There was Laura Loomer saying, please, Mr. President, act now before they steal the midterm. Act now before they silence you.
[31:04.000 --> 31:12.000]  And it was very prophetic. And then the Democrat, sounding like Porky Pig, tried to even silence her and talk over her. Here it is.
[31:12.000 --> 31:20.000]  Mr. President, Donald Trump, when one of your employees makes me the calender of your censorship service, and I'm asking you, President Donald Trump, help us.
[31:20.000 --> 31:30.000]  Please help us, Mr. President, before it is too late, because Jack Dorsey is trying to influence the election to sway the election so that the Democrats can steal the election.
[31:30.000 --> 31:46.000]  That is why it is censoring and shocking. You are a liar, Jack. You are a liar. You are a liar. You are a liar.
[31:46.000 --> 32:07.000]  And again, there are dozens of versions of these. Some of these are kind of HD, the one we found is not that good. But you can hear, please, before it is too late, Mr. President, take action, do something about this.
[32:07.000 --> 32:17.000]  And now we finally see your governor, DeSantis, I wish the Texas governor was like this, cracking down and saying, this is racketeering, it's election meddling, it's organized crime.
[32:17.000 --> 32:26.000]  They're working in concert or surveilling people. They're taking candidates' websites away. They're taking members of Congresses away or their pages. They're blocking the former president.
[32:26.000 --> 32:33.000]  This is incredible. So wow, Laura Lumer, total vindication, but I don't think it's not very sweet to be vindicated, is it?
[32:33.000 --> 32:42.000]  Well, it's a bit bittersweet, right, Alex? But, you know, you said that that was a Democrat who auctioned me off. It was actually a Republican.
[32:42.000 --> 32:53.000]  It was from Missouri, which makes it even worse. And you would think that it was a Democrat because, you know, this hearing, and you were sitting right next to me when this happened, this was taking place at the same time as the Kavanaugh hearings.
[32:53.000 --> 33:05.000]  And it was funny because during the Kavanaugh hearings, you had Republicans and you had Chuck Grassley saying, oh, it's okay, these women who are coming in and protesting, doused in pure blood and screaming and destroying property, that's their free speech, right?
[33:05.000 --> 33:18.000]  But as soon as I do it, right, it was a Republican who shut me down. And that's what we're seeing right now in the Republican Party, is, you know, you take somebody like Marjorie Taylor Greene or myself, you know, candidates who ran for office and had very successful campaigns,
[33:18.000 --> 33:24.000]  raised a lot of money, and it's the Republicans that are trying to silence us more than the Democrats.
[33:24.000 --> 33:29.000]  You know, I forgot that that guy was a Republican, or I guess I always thought he was a Democrat because, you know, I mean, he looks like a child molester.
[33:29.000 --> 33:38.000]  I'm not saying he's a child molester, he just has that Brian Stelter-esque look, but I mean, and I'm not joking, folks, though. I mean, I am joking, but he's probably not a pedophile.
[33:38.000 --> 33:46.000]  I'm just saying these people look creepy and it's not right to make physical comments. It's just that they're raping our freedom and I'm so tired of it.
[33:46.000 --> 33:55.000]  There's a big article out, The Rise of the GOP posters caucus, and they attack you, they attack me, and they say, oh my gosh.
[33:55.000 --> 34:04.000]  And we also have Mitch McConnell coming out saying, if we allow these new women that got elected as Republicans that you just talked about to be the new face, our party's dead.
[34:04.000 --> 34:12.000]  But she won in Georgia, as you just said, by 75%. So it looks like they're scared of our populist movement actually taking over and winning.
[34:12.000 --> 34:26.000]  Yeah, they definitely are. And although this article is published in The Verge, which is, you know, a leftist publication, they give me and you credit for changing the energy in the Republican Party.
[34:26.000 --> 34:35.000]  And so if you read this article, they say that that day in Congress, when I confronted Jack Dorsey when you were there and you got into it with Mark Arubio, which they mentioned as well.
[34:35.000 --> 34:43.000]  They said that that activist energy was so viral that it caused other Republicans to get the same type of energy.
[34:43.000 --> 34:58.000]  And they said the way Marjorie Taylor Greene was using her cell phone to film herself getting into arguments with members of Congress, you know, mimic the way that, you know, we had our selfie sticks and our camera crews confronting members of the Senate and members of the Congress on Capitol Hill as well.
[34:58.000 --> 35:07.000]  And so, you know, not only are people like you and I and others, you know, pioneers for this free speech movements and paving the way for others who have been de-platformed.
[35:07.000 --> 35:27.000]  But, you know, one of the one of the best benefits of this is that we've inspired other people as well to be more aggressive in their tactics so that we can, you know, force the nationalist and populist narrative into Congress and drive out the rhinos.
[35:27.000 --> 35:32.000]  Looking at this, because it's not about, oh, look, there's an article about Laura Loomer and Alex Jones. There's hundreds of these a week.
[35:32.000 --> 35:46.000]  This one actually tells the truth, though, and they admit that it was that viral activism that has now been a chain reaction that myself and you and others have really pioneered in the modern sense of not just screaming out one-line slogans like Code Pink,
[35:46.000 --> 35:59.000]  but actually confronting people with real issues and going to hearings where we're being discussed and saying, we have a right to face our accusers like I did with Sundar Pichai and Jack Dorsey and so many others, that they're scared of that happening.
[35:59.000 --> 36:09.000]  And that's one reason they did the whole COVID lockdown, was Congress was horrified because so many other regular citizens were going to the Senate buildings, the House buildings, as most of the hearings folks aren't in the Capitol,
[36:09.000 --> 36:16.000]  and actually going and peacefully confronting their supposed elected servants.
[36:16.000 --> 36:33.000]  Right. And that's, you know, that's what Loomer is all about. You know, it was kind of frowned upon before, but now we have emboldened everyday people, everyday Americans to use their social media to use their cell phones to confront politicians and hold them accountable.
[36:33.000 --> 36:43.000]  And gone are the days of the people just, you know, being complicit and treating these politicians like royalty who ought to never be questioned or confronted.
[36:43.000 --> 36:58.000]  You know, you see it every single day, whether it's the woman in New York who, you know, ripped Chuck Schumer a new one or it's you confronting Marco Rubio or me, you know, confronting Congress and Jack Dorsey during the hearing.
[36:58.000 --> 37:05.000]  Everyday people are being emboldened and the reason why the GOP is freaking out is because they want to control everybody.
[37:05.000 --> 37:20.000]  And when you have inspiring people, especially an inspiring woman like Marjorie Taylor Greene or, you know, a candidate like myself here in Florida, it emboldens other people and it gives them that same type of energy and confidence to run for office themselves.
[37:20.000 --> 37:30.000]  And the GOP is scared that they're not going to be able to control all of the candidates and keep them on a tight leash, which is, you know, what they've traditionally always done.
[37:30.000 --> 37:38.000]  When you run for office, you know, you're expected to kiss Kevin McCarthy's ass. You're expected to do everything right so that you get put on the NRCC list.
[37:38.000 --> 37:44.000]  Well, you know what? I did everything right and I outperformed most of the people, if not all of them, who were put on their little list.
[37:44.000 --> 37:52.000]  Some people who were put on their list and even win their primaries. I won my primary while being totally banned and raised $2.5 million on my own with the help of the American people.
[37:52.000 --> 37:57.000]  And got your name recognition up even more in Florida, so you're going to end up winning a seat in the near future.
[37:57.000 --> 38:00.000]  You are the woman in the arena. You're the example of what we need to do.
[38:00.000 --> 38:04.000]  Now, they're so scared of you, though, Laura, because they admit you're one of the first dominoes to falls.
[38:04.000 --> 38:14.000]  This isn't about, oh, bragging about Laura, bragging about Alex Jones. You get attacked when you're the first to be the shock troops going over the barbed wire and the information war.
[38:14.000 --> 38:27.000]  She has been even more banned than I have. Bank accounts, Uber, Airbnb, when she came back into the U.S. from a visit to Central America during all this, they pulled her aside and interrogated her about her political views, brought up her Wikipedia.
[38:27.000 --> 38:37.000]  Now she's been put on the no-gun by list, the red flag, that is totally unconstitutional and ties into this new bill, HR 127.
[38:37.000 --> 38:44.000]  When we come back, we'll talk about that with Laura Loomer. Please don't forget, listeners, without you, we're not going to stay on here.
[38:44.000 --> 38:55.000]  I want to thank you all for your support. We have great new t-shirts in, the new Trader Joe shirt, showing how Joe Biden is a trader to America with communist China, Russia, and others.
[38:55.000 --> 39:08.000]  It's available at infowarstore.com. And we have turbocharger defenses with these incredible new sales, DNA Force Plus, selling out, so good for your cells, so good for your body, your immune system, 25% off, you know, it's selling out, ultra 12%, 50% off,

[39:26.000 --> 39:32.000]  So ultra 12, back in stock, DNA Force, about to sell out, infowarstore.com.
[39:32.000 --> 39:41.000]  And without you, we will not be on air, so please keep us in your prayers because we are under attack, because everything we've talked about is now coming true.
[39:41.000 --> 39:54.000]  Come back and talk about gun confiscation, it's officially in the bill, the new order in coming, it's here, but if we stay on air and if we raise the alarm, you're going to see other action by folks like the Santas.
[39:54.000 --> 40:06.000]  So what's the most important part, let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist, the treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front, it's all very important, but the fuel is paramount, and that's my allegory.
[40:06.000 --> 40:17.000]  Turbo Force is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system, metabolism of a human.
[40:17.000 --> 40:25.000]  Some people get 15 hours out of this, some people get about 8 hours, but people take this, people take it in sports, people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not high.
[40:25.000 --> 40:34.000]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts, their post-workouts, you can call us whatever you want, it's a total solution, all around the best you're going to find.
[40:34.000 --> 40:39.000]  Turbo Force, without you, we don't roll. With you, we search forward together.
[40:39.000 --> 40:44.000]  It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel. If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[40:44.000 --> 40:49.000]  You support us to get products you already need that literally fuel your body and your mind? It's a win-win, 360 together.
[40:49.000 --> 41:05.000]  infowarstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[41:19.000 --> 41:26.000]  We are the people who have moved on to their main target, to madden with the mRNA vaccines, which are not vaccines.
[41:26.000 --> 41:37.000]  They are recombinant DNA from aborted cloned fetuses, were then inserted into your genome to take over your body's systems.
[41:37.000 --> 41:44.000]  Go read the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines and then remember you've been warned.
[41:44.000 --> 41:53.000]  This is the equivalent of an alien takeover. Whether it's interdimensional, whether it's little green men, the globalists are acting like another species that's overtaking us and overriding us.
[41:53.000 --> 42:22.000]  This is the same in the end.
[42:23.000 --> 42:30.000]  I'm trying to shut it down so desperately because we have the light in the dark of the night that sends chills at my spine.
[42:30.000 --> 42:38.000]  So whatever you do, continue to support yourself and InfoWars by buying the great products at infowarstore.com, by spreading the articles, by spreading the videos,
[42:38.000 --> 42:44.000]  and by praying for this operation and for praying for this nation and the world for peace and discernment.
[42:44.000 --> 42:51.000]  For myself and the whole InfoWars family, I want to thank all of you for what you've done because without you, InfoWars is nothing.
[42:51.000 --> 42:56.000]  You are the InfoWars and I salute you.
[42:56.000 --> 43:05.000]  I've got some bad news. Our best-selling vitamin mineral fusion has sold out because people understand in these stressful times it's now more important than ever to boost your body's natural defenses.
[43:05.000 --> 43:13.000]  But here's the good news. Turmeric acts in very similar ways and is so good for inflammation, so good for your immune system.
[43:13.000 --> 43:21.000]  And we've got two great turmeric formulas. One is body's ultimate turmeric formula that is a dried turmeric extract, 95% humanoid.
[43:21.000 --> 43:27.000]  People love it. That's selling out. Despite that, it's still discounted at infowarstore.com.
[43:27.000 --> 43:33.000]  And then also selling out this week is our liquid turmeric extract. It's called liquid turmeric extract.
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.000]  People really love it. It's extremely strong as well. It's selling out.
[43:37.000 --> 43:44.000]  If your purchase doesn't just help yourself and your body, it also funds the InfoWars and keeps us on air while they're trying to shut everybody down.
[43:44.000 --> 43:54.000]  So thank you all for your support. Please visit infowarstore.com and find so many other great items that will enrich yourself and your family's life and fund the InfoWars.
[43:54.000 --> 44:08.000]  God bless and good luck.
[44:25.000 --> 44:31.000]  Of our elaborate plans.
[44:31.000 --> 44:38.000]  And Anthony Cooney is coming up at 15 minutes the next hour. I'm going to break the most devastating evidence of COVID being a total fraud.
[44:38.000 --> 44:45.000]  Now to absolutely turn the tide and defeat the new world order in the first and second segments of the next hour.
[44:45.000 --> 44:50.000]  But earlier, I told the crew just real fast and said, hey, get a clip of Laura Loomer.
[44:50.000 --> 44:54.000]  Two and a half years ago, warning President Trump laying everything out in Congress and being talked over.
[44:54.000 --> 45:01.000]  And they just real fast grabbed a clip. It was so many dozens of versions. It was a bad one. Not their fault. My fault for not telling them 10 minutes before.
[45:01.000 --> 45:06.000]  So we actually found a better res copy of this. It's very historical. It's very important.
[45:06.000 --> 45:19.000]  And the globalists have really talked about this as the chain reaction. This scared the corrupt lawmakers so much that invite the communist and Code Pink and, you know, all the other black lives matter to block the...
[45:19.000 --> 45:23.000]  the hallways and attack people and do all that. They're wonderful.
[45:23.000 --> 45:32.000]  But when you just speak up, you're a terrorist. And then, of course, you had the so-called capital attack. They killed four of our people who stupidly went in, but they weren't terrorists.
[45:32.000 --> 45:39.000]  And then one cop died later of a heart attack. They're now saying it was the ultimate attack. Worse than Pearl Harbor. It was bad as 9-11.
[45:39.000 --> 45:45.000]  Just insane garbage. And now they have permanent troops. They're saying in D.C. and they're going to use the CIA against Americans.
[45:45.000 --> 45:54.000]  And they're going to take our guns. And it's now happened to Laura Loomer. So they are so afraid of women who are smart and well-spoken standing up. And here's what she actually had to say.
[45:54.000 --> 46:15.000]  Dorsi, you are lying about censoring conservatives. You are caught on tape by Project Veritas, shadow banning people. You are censoring people. You censored me. You censored Milo. You censored Johnston. You even censored President Trump when one of your employees deleted his account for a few minutes. You are censoring conservatives.
[46:15.000 --> 46:28.000]  Please help us, Mr. President, before it is too late, because Jack Dorsey is trying to influence the election to sway the election so that the Democrats can steal the election. That is why he is censoring and shadow banning conservatives.
[46:28.000 --> 46:40.000]  You are a liar, Jack Dorsey. You are a liar, Jack Dorsey. You unverified me on November 15, 2017.
[46:40.000 --> 46:52.000]  Because who will you escort this young lady out? Stop the bias. We are conservative Americans, not Russian bots, Jack Dorsey. Stop the bias.
[46:52.000 --> 47:04.000]  By the way, I'm just springing this on you guys. Can you guys pull up Owen Shroyer gets arrested at the Capitol? He's out in the front area. He has tape over his mouth. They say no protest and take him to jail because Democrats ordered it.
[47:04.000 --> 47:10.000]  And Democrats again can be as violent as they want. This is an incredible double standard, Laura.
[47:10.000 --> 47:21.000]  No, it definitely is. And people listening to the video, they may wonder, well, why didn't Laura mention Alex Jones in the list of names when she was talking about who he'd censored?
[47:21.000 --> 47:33.000]  Well, during this hearing, they were asking Jack Dorsey and Mark Zuckerberg whether they censored conservatives. And the very next day, Alex Jones, you of course, were banned from Twitter if you recall.
[47:33.000 --> 47:44.000]  But it was the day after this hearing, exactly to the day that you were banned. And so they had spent the entire day lying to Congress, okay, committing perjury, saying that they don't censor people.
[47:44.000 --> 47:53.000]  And then just to basically give everybody a big middle finger, they banned Info Wars and Alex Jones the day after this hearing.
[47:53.000 --> 48:03.000]  Now, let's talk about something that is so scary. And by scary, it makes me so mad I get scared because I read the bill. I read the whole thing.
[48:03.000 --> 48:15.000]  Overhead shot, please. HR 127, a new bill in Congress would literally end the Second Amendment, writes permanently, Michael Snyder of endoftheamericandream.com is not exaggerating the stories on InfoWars.com.
[48:15.000 --> 48:27.000]  He says it. I've read the whole bill. House bill would require psych test liability insurance for gun ownership, implement mass retroactive registry, of course, for the confiscation.
[48:27.000 --> 48:38.000]  So no judge, no jury. The leftist psychiatry system is now in psychology systems and control. I've read the bill. Let me show you some of the subsections here so you understand that we're not kidding.
[48:38.000 --> 48:54.000]  Firearm registration system. Number one, require information under the farm registry system. The owner of a farm shall transmit the bureau and it goes on to say retroactively all farms be registered and handed in those documents to them.
[48:54.000 --> 49:08.000]  It goes on to say general license, except an otherwise provision of the subsection. The attorney general shall issue an individual a license to possess a firearm and ammunition of the individual. It's a federal license to own guns.
[49:08.000 --> 49:21.000]  I mean, wow, this is crazy. And then it goes into everything you've got to do. You have to go through the psychiatry check. Anybody can complain you lose your guns. Psychological evaluation.
[49:21.000 --> 49:32.000]  The evaluation is conducted in compliance with such standards as shall be established by the attorney general puts us an open into the attorney general's God and it's all regulatory. I mean, this is so bad. I can't even explain it to you.
[49:32.000 --> 49:40.000]  Here it is. It has a chronic mental illness or disturbance or brain disease referred to in the subparagraph. So now you got Parkinson's you can't own a gun.
[49:40.000 --> 49:53.000]  Is addicted or controlled substance. So, oh, you've been getting medical marijuana. Attorney general can just say you can't have it has attempted to commit suicide or prior psychological treatment or evaluation of individual indicated that the individual engage in
[49:53.000 --> 50:02.000]  conduct that poses a danger to self or others. She got in a fist fight a few years ago and it goes on. It just gives them open ended total power. Let's talk about Laura Loomer. No criminal record.
[50:02.000 --> 50:12.000]  Upstanding lady. You have now been put on the red flag. You cannot buy a gun. And it's just there's no judge. No jury just talk to the hand. Tell folks what just happened to you.
[50:12.000 --> 50:26.000]  Yeah, so this happened during my congressional campaign and I didn't release it because you know I've been getting a lot of death threats and I know the security risks during my campaign were already big enough that I you know I was also waiting to release this information.
[50:26.000 --> 50:38.000]  So during my campaign I applied for a concealed carry at the time I already had a gun because in the state of Florida you don't need to have a license to have a gun and you know you only need a concealed carry if you plan on carrying your gun.
[50:38.000 --> 50:50.000]  So I had a gun at my place right I'm allowed to do that I'm allowed to have a gun when I applied for my concealed carry permit I received a letter in the mail that said it was denied but then they said if you want to appeal this or you think a mistake was made.
[50:50.000 --> 51:01.000]  You can appeal it so then I appealed and had them review my application and then I got another letter back saying that it was denied and then they have another form that you fill out where you ask why.
[51:01.000 --> 51:15.000]  Then a couple weeks later I got that letter that you just showed that said that I people people who are on the next database federally prohibited from owning firearms cannot have concealed carry permits.
[51:15.000 --> 51:29.000]  So this isn't just a concealed carry permit denial this is a letter saying that because my name is in the next database which is controlled by the FBI the FBI is the only organization that can put your name in this database.
[51:29.000 --> 51:41.000]  I am not allowed to possess a firearm I am not allowed to own a firearm and like I said I had a gun so nobody told me that I was on this list and the only reason I found out is because I applied for concealed carry.
[51:41.000 --> 51:53.000]  If I were to have just said whatever I guess I don't really need a concealed carry and not have asked for a further review and then followed up again to ask why I would still have the gun.
[51:53.000 --> 52:13.000]  I'll be in the federal prohibition list or next and then then what would happen if I got doorstopped by the FBI the same way they've been harassing Trump supporters ahead of events on the Capitol on the six.
[52:13.000 --> 52:20.000]  They did this while you're running for Congress super popular while they're trying to ban you President Trump tweeting about you President Trump voted for you.
[52:20.000 --> 52:29.000]  They're scared of you and they know you're getting death threats we're going to get all the stuff that's happening behind the scenes people coming to your house and things or how they beat up Roger Stone's wife few weeks ago and this is bad okay.
[52:29.000 --> 52:34.000]  And so all this is unfolding you're in the devil's den going up against them.
[52:34.000 --> 52:49.000]  And so what they're put in HR 127 that they say they've got the votes to pass in the house at least is putting in law this open power the Attorney General or the FBI to just ban anybody but they're already doing it by fiat to you and countless others.
[52:49.000 --> 52:52.000]  This is criminal they need congressional hearings on this.
[52:52.000 --> 52:55.000]  This is way worse than them banning you off the Internet.
[52:55.000 --> 52:56.000]  That's bad enough.
[52:56.000 --> 52:57.000]  This is insane.
[52:57.000 --> 53:04.000]  This is what are your lawyers saying you've got lawyers of the recourse of some magic group just puts you in some list.
[53:04.000 --> 53:18.000]  Well I've been told and some of the information because I've been doing some research into this and some of the statistics that you know I found is that you know the federally denied persons file is compiled of individuals that are predetermined to have firearm prohibitions without listing a specific category.
[53:18.000 --> 53:24.000]  So this is their way of putting you in a database without it showing what the reason is.
[53:24.000 --> 53:31.000]  So if you have a vindictive or politically charged FBI agent who doesn't like you and we see that the FBI has become weaponized to attack.
[53:31.000 --> 53:35.000]  And again they don't have to tell you in the SWAT team you saying you've got guns.
[53:35.000 --> 53:36.000]  Right.
[53:36.000 --> 53:42.000]  So imagine if somebody were to maliciously have my place swatted right when I didn't know that I was on this list.
[53:42.000 --> 53:52.000]  The feds would have shown up SWAT team would have probably raided my home found a gun and then I could have found myself in prison for four to 10 years for a firearm felony when no one let me know.
[53:52.000 --> 53:58.000]  How how many Americans are getting set up to have firearms felony charges because they're on this list.
[53:58.000 --> 53:59.000]  Stay there.
[53:59.000 --> 54:00.000]  Stay there.
[54:00.000 --> 54:02.000]  This is one of the few areas Trump did bad at least giving lip service to it.
[54:02.000 --> 54:04.000]  He thought would do process.
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.000]  This one was found to be you know certified schizophrenic or something.
[54:06.000 --> 54:07.000]  No.
[54:07.000 --> 54:08.000]  This is not new process.
[54:08.000 --> 54:13.000]  Let's do five more minutes and then I'll hit the really huge cover news and then Anthony Cooney and join us.
[54:13.000 --> 54:21.000]  I want to go to break for two minutes come back and talk more about this with you and also play a clip from the past when I confronted Sundar Pachai at the Capitol.
[54:21.000 --> 54:26.000]  Remember back we didn't wear masks back when you can actually go places do things before you were locked down under globalist martial law.
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  But folks you can fight back.
[54:28.000 --> 54:38.000]  So everybody you know about the local radio station you're listening to local TV station local cable station and spread the word about info wars dot com forward slash show and ban dot video.
[54:38.000 --> 54:39.000]  That's how you circumvent the sensors.
[54:39.000 --> 54:40.000]  That's how you raise the alarm.
[54:40.000 --> 54:41.000]  It's beyond critical.
[54:41.000 --> 54:46.000]  Stay with us.
[54:46.000 --> 54:52.000]  We have the technocrats are controlling the food supply secure your own safe source of food supply sale.
[54:52.000 --> 54:59.000]  This is in twenty twenty one but it's the lowest price for high quality food you're going to find at info or store dot com subsection is prepared with Alex dot com.
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  And it's all these globalists do this.
[55:01.000 --> 55:10.000]  And as they hoard the food and as they prepare you need to understand that you need twenty five year food supply at the last twenty five years one month three months six months one year supplies.
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  And it's the highest quality you're going to find.
[55:12.000 --> 55:15.000]  And it's just good to have that check box taken care of.
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  And you know you're getting good food at a very good price.
[55:17.000 --> 55:22.000]  And you know that a small percentage of it because there's not much profit in this goes to us to fund our operation.
[55:22.000 --> 55:26.000]  So prepare Alex dot com or info wars store dot com.
[55:26.000 --> 55:29.000]  You can find preparing this section there water filtration air filtration.
[55:29.000 --> 55:30.000]  It's all there.
[55:30.000 --> 55:33.000]  The technocrats are getting ready to bring in all the force GMO and more.
[55:33.000 --> 55:34.000]  It's time to start getting prepared.
[55:34.000 --> 55:35.000]  It starts with self defense.
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  It starts with being prepared.
[55:37.000 --> 55:38.000]  It starts with horrible food.
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  It starts with digging in with a long globalist fight.
[55:40.000 --> 55:45.000]  You'll win in the end.
[55:45.000 --> 55:49.000]  Webster's dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism.
[55:49.000 --> 55:52.000]  Other dictionaries have similar ones.
[55:52.000 --> 55:59.000]  Terrorism is the threat of force or actually carrying out force for a political or financial reason.
[55:59.000 --> 56:03.000]  It's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them.
[56:03.000 --> 56:07.000]  That's exactly what all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is.
[56:07.000 --> 56:12.000]  You see the headlines from CNN and you see those doctors say it's worse than they ever thought.
[56:12.000 --> 56:15.000]  A little bit more devastating than you'd ever imagine.
[56:15.000 --> 56:21.000]  They told us that two and a half million people would be dead just eight months ago within three months.
[56:21.000 --> 56:22.000]  Okay.
[56:22.000 --> 56:23.000]  It's a quarter million.
[56:23.000 --> 56:29.000]  If you count all of the people that died of other things, we're talking 96% had comorbidity.
[56:29.000 --> 56:30.000]  These are real numbers.
[56:30.000 --> 56:31.000]  These are real facts.
[56:31.000 --> 56:36.000]  This is the chicken little event where we all run our houses, never come out and are taught we're not essential.
[56:36.000 --> 56:39.000]  All the big box stores in Amazon take over the planet.
[56:39.000 --> 56:41.000]  You could stand up against it.
[56:41.000 --> 56:42.000]  It is slavery.
[56:42.000 --> 56:45.000]  It is not something you could put up with and survive.
[56:47.000 --> 56:51.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[57:01.000 --> 57:06.000]  They're now erecting a permanent wall around the Capitol and saying troops will probably never leave.
[57:06.000 --> 57:11.000]  They're announcing on every channel a new war against gun owners, conservatives and Trump supporters.
[57:11.000 --> 57:14.000]  They're a far and back takeover operation.
[57:14.000 --> 57:15.000]  It happened in Russia.
[57:15.000 --> 57:16.000]  It happened in Germany.
[57:16.000 --> 57:20.000]  It happened in Venezuela, Cuba, North Korea.
[57:20.000 --> 57:21.000]  It happened in China.
[57:21.000 --> 57:23.000]  It happened almost everywhere before.
[57:23.000 --> 57:25.000]  Now it's happening here.
[57:25.000 --> 57:27.000]  Bonafide criminal takeover.
[57:29.000 --> 57:35.000]  Right around the same time, two and a half years ago, here I am confronting Sundar Pachai in a hearing where they talked about me
[57:35.000 --> 57:36.000]  before he even got there.
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  They were attacking me and after.
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  But I wasn't allowed to face my accuser.
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  Here's some of the video.
[57:50.000 --> 57:53.000]  Sundar, you know Google is helping China with dragon flies.
[57:53.000 --> 57:55.000]  You know they're helping sensor.
[57:55.000 --> 57:57.000]  You know you've sold this country out.
[57:57.000 --> 57:59.000]  And you won't even help the Pentagon.
[57:59.000 --> 58:00.000]  You'll help the Chag Nobs.
[58:00.000 --> 58:02.000]  You bet on the wrong country, Sundar.
[58:02.000 --> 58:04.000]  Here he goes, ladies and gentlemen.
[58:06.000 --> 58:08.000]  That guy has got his people, the whole Congress, you know, it's history.
[58:08.000 --> 58:10.000]  He's a liar to Congress.
[58:10.000 --> 58:14.000]  And you'd be arrested just like that Chinese spy got arrested in Canada two weeks ago.
[58:22.000 --> 58:25.000]  Sundar, you know you're not an American.
[58:25.000 --> 58:27.000]  You can't work with Congress Chinese.
[58:27.000 --> 58:29.000]  You can't work with Congress Chinese.
[58:29.000 --> 58:32.000]  Sundar, you can't work with Congress Chinese on dragon flies,
[58:32.000 --> 58:34.000]  censoring and rounding up the dissidents.
[58:34.000 --> 58:37.000]  Sundar is arresting dissidents of China.
[58:37.000 --> 58:40.000]  Apple is working with China to suppress their people.
[58:40.000 --> 58:43.000]  Sundar, you're engaged in treason.
[58:43.000 --> 58:46.000]  You've had Google executives lie to Congress and you're not censoring conservatives.
[58:46.000 --> 58:49.000]  Sundar, you will not silence the people.
[58:49.000 --> 58:53.000]  Your censorship will not work anymore, Sundar.
[58:53.000 --> 58:56.000]  We're aware of your activities, trying to muzzle the American people
[58:56.000 --> 58:59.000]  and gaining your search results.
[58:59.000 --> 59:01.000]  Google is evil.
[59:01.000 --> 59:03.000]  Google is evil.
[59:03.000 --> 59:05.000]  Google is evil.
[59:05.000 --> 59:07.000]  But loomer.com is her website.
[59:07.000 --> 59:08.000]  That's where you find Laura Loomer.
[59:08.000 --> 59:09.000]  Loomer.com.
[59:09.000 --> 59:10.000]  You find us at infowords.com.
[59:10.000 --> 59:11.000]  I know you know that.
[59:11.000 --> 59:12.000]  Tell others.
[59:12.000 --> 59:13.000]  Go back to the URLs.
[59:13.000 --> 59:14.000]  Circumvent big tech.
[59:14.000 --> 59:15.000]  We warned everybody.
[59:15.000 --> 59:16.000]  Now we're here.
[59:16.000 --> 59:20.000]  Laura Loomer is here with us in closing in the three minutes we have.
[59:20.000 --> 59:22.000]  So this is a big deal.
[59:22.000 --> 59:25.000]  We need Governor DeSantis.
[59:25.000 --> 59:29.000]  We need a Congressperson to champion you and this red flag law.
[59:29.000 --> 59:30.000]  It's the right thing to do.
[59:30.000 --> 59:31.000]  It'll be incredibly popular.
[59:31.000 --> 59:35.000]  The fact that the Justice Department is quietly trying to do this is so incredibly criminal.
[59:35.000 --> 59:41.000]  And now trying to codify it in law, at least we're trying to do that now, HR 127.
[59:41.000 --> 59:42.000]  Right.
[59:42.000 --> 59:46.000]  Well, you know, I've been in communication with Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green,
[59:46.000 --> 59:48.000]  who is a friend of mine.
[59:48.000 --> 59:52.000]  And she, of course, has been an advocate for me and she thinks this is egregious.
[59:52.000 --> 59:55.000]  And, you know, this is something that she's committed to fighting.
[59:55.000 --> 1:00:00.000]  And during a town hall in Georgia the other day, she was on video using, you know,
[1:00:00.000 --> 1:00:05.000]  mighty platforming and now this illegal red flagging total, you know,
[1:00:05.000 --> 1:00:09.000]  unconstitutional violation of my second amendment rights as an example for what's to come.
[1:00:09.000 --> 1:00:11.000]  You see the bill that you have there, right?
[1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:16.000]  Did you know that that one third one in three Americans at some time in their life,
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:20.000]  they will take antidepressants or anti anxiety medication for whatever.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:24.000]  So when they're telling like, oh, psychiatric evaluations, that's one third of the country
[1:00:24.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  right there that is going to be banned from having guns.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:31.000]  Now they're going to deem 75 to 80 million Americans as domestic terrorists.
[1:00:31.000 --> 1:00:34.000]  Well, when you're deemed a domestic terrorist, you're not allowed to have guns.
[1:00:34.000 --> 1:00:38.000]  So how many hundreds of millions of people is that in the American public who are now,
[1:00:38.000 --> 1:00:42.000]  if this bill goes forward, federally prohibited from ever owning a gun?
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:43.000]  Okay.
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:44.000]  And take Congresswoman Green.
[1:00:44.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  She's a great lady, wonderful, strong.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:50.000]  They want to expel her and reverse her 75% landslide.
[1:00:50.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  She won with the biggest margin of any Republican because people are sick and tired and they're upset
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:01:00.000]  and the globalists are scared and they think outlaw in our speech is going to make us go away.
[1:01:00.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  It's not, is it, Laura?
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:04.000]  No, it's definitely not.
[1:01:04.000 --> 1:01:07.000]  And, you know, we need more people to start just speaking out about this.
[1:01:07.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  And if the rhinos and the GOP are not willing to get behind efforts to cancel, cancel culture,
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  then they themselves need to be canceled.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:21.000]  If they are not going to support Marjorie Taylor-Green and realize that our own party is having a revolution,
[1:01:21.000 --> 1:01:23.000]  then it's time to cancel the establishment.
[1:01:23.000 --> 1:01:24.000]  Well, that's the good news.
[1:01:24.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  Polls out of, real polls out of a Chinese district, Wyoming, Montana, it all makes us together.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  Same beautiful God's country.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:35.000]  She has a 9% approval rating now.
[1:01:35.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  So absolutely.
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:37.000]  We have the power.
[1:01:37.000 --> 1:01:38.000]  Trump's more popular now than ever.
[1:01:38.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  It blew up in their face.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:40.000]  They stole the election.
[1:01:40.000 --> 1:01:43.000]  Loomer.com, Laura, we really appreciate you.
[1:01:43.000 --> 1:01:44.000]  Yeah.
[1:01:44.000 --> 1:01:45.000]  Thank you, Alex.
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  Thanks for having me on.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:47.000]  A lot of great stuff at Loomer.com.
[1:01:47.000 --> 1:01:48.000]  All right.
[1:01:48.000 --> 1:01:49.000]  We'll be right back with the big enchilada.
[1:01:49.000 --> 1:01:54.000]  Stay with us.
[1:01:54.000 --> 1:01:59.000]  There are almost no free independent media infrastructures in the United States, much
[1:01:59.000 --> 1:02:00.000]  less in the entire world.
[1:02:00.000 --> 1:02:05.640]  Info Wars is standalone with our own radio and TV satellite uplinks at hundreds of stations
[1:02:05.640 --> 1:02:06.640]  picking us up.
[1:02:06.640 --> 1:02:12.800]  Almost no one else has that, especially anybody covering real issues of global populism, the
[1:02:12.800 --> 1:02:17.960]  right to self-defense, and exposing the anti-human globalist death agenda.
[1:02:17.960 --> 1:02:22.120]  That's why when we go out and shoot videos, they're at band.video.
[1:02:22.120 --> 1:02:26.600]  They're not allowed to be on Twitter, on YouTube, on Facebook.
[1:02:26.600 --> 1:02:31.680]  That's why it's so precious, because censorship expands to everyone, which it is now, with
[1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:34.920]  AI monitoring controlling what you can say and do.
[1:02:34.920 --> 1:02:40.120]  It's going to be the OACs, like band.video, and the now redesigned infowars.com to become
[1:02:40.120 --> 1:02:42.280]  more and more important, which they are.
[1:02:42.280 --> 1:02:47.960]  And the enemy is suing us, attacking us, hacking us, lying about us, sabotaging us, infiltrating
[1:02:47.960 --> 1:02:51.680]  us, trying to shut us down right now, because they're coming after everyone.
[1:02:51.680 --> 1:02:55.560]  So spread the word now.
[1:02:55.560 --> 1:02:58.120]  We shall go on to the end.
[1:02:58.120 --> 1:03:00.480]  We shall fight in France.
[1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:03.680]  We shall fight on the seas and oceans.
[1:03:03.680 --> 1:03:09.600]  We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air.
[1:03:09.600 --> 1:03:13.640]  We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be.
[1:03:13.640 --> 1:03:15.840]  We shall fight on the beaches.
[1:03:15.840 --> 1:03:18.600]  We shall fight on the landing grounds.
[1:03:18.600 --> 1:03:22.240]  We shall fight in the fields and in the streets.
[1:03:22.240 --> 1:03:24.640]  We shall fight in the hills.
[1:03:24.640 --> 1:03:25.840]  We shall never surrender.
[1:03:25.840 --> 1:03:29.960]  And we shall fight for the settlement.
[1:03:29.960 --> 1:03:36.640]  From Freedom Command Central, it's the Alex Jones Show.
[1:03:36.640 --> 1:03:43.240]  Ace is high, my friends, and we are battling the globalists at point blank range.
[1:03:43.240 --> 1:03:45.880]  Let me hit the big news as we start the second hour.
[1:03:45.880 --> 1:03:53.160]  I'm going to put it all in this little nine-minute, 10-minute segment, so get ready right now.
[1:03:53.160 --> 1:04:01.440]  I take you first to this exhibit, busted CDC inflated COVID numbers accused of violating
[1:04:01.440 --> 1:04:03.640]  federal law.
[1:04:03.640 --> 1:04:09.200]  And here we've got the article from the great folks at NationalFile.com.
[1:04:09.200 --> 1:04:11.080]  It's linked on Infowars.com.
[1:04:11.080 --> 1:04:16.520]  Here's the major science, public health policy, and law, volume, medical study, respected
[1:04:16.520 --> 1:04:22.800]  COVID-19 death collection, co-morbidity, federal law, and historical retrospective.
[1:04:22.800 --> 1:04:28.640]  Just even what the New York Times had a report last year, 6% of the people they say died
[1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:34.440]  of COVID actually died of an incredible, big, thick report, go read it for yourself.
[1:04:34.440 --> 1:04:38.520]  We're going to be laying all of this out and the latest developments in a moment.
[1:04:38.520 --> 1:04:45.800]  But first, let's give you a historical context of why big corporations would do this and
[1:04:45.800 --> 1:04:50.200]  what they have to stand to gain when it comes to total power.
[1:04:50.200 --> 1:05:01.320]  First exhibit, Theranos founder, Elizabeth Holmes, fraud trial, has a new start date.
[1:05:01.320 --> 1:05:06.680]  They just keep kicking it down the road year after year because, you know, this came out
[1:05:06.680 --> 1:05:10.960]  five years ago, six years ago, because it ties into the very same big investors like
[1:05:10.960 --> 1:05:16.160]  who, who was her big sugar daddy, Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.
[1:05:16.160 --> 1:05:21.960]  They even had documentaries out two years ago with her and Bill Gates and I mean, they're
[1:05:21.960 --> 1:05:22.960]  still big buddies.
[1:05:22.960 --> 1:05:28.080]  So this was a beta test, but here's the problem, Bernie Madoff stole tens of millions of dollars
[1:05:28.080 --> 1:05:32.440]  from investors and his, his crime was they were rich and his crime was he didn't involve
[1:05:32.440 --> 1:05:35.920]  a bunch of other big companies because then they would just lobby Congress to do nothing
[1:05:35.920 --> 1:05:37.640]  on the Justice Department.
[1:05:37.640 --> 1:05:45.960]  Madoff operated as a lone wolf, well, Theranos operated as a front woman, connections to
[1:05:45.960 --> 1:05:50.920]  Epstein, connections to Bill Gates, connections to all of them and what did she do?
[1:05:50.920 --> 1:05:54.280]  She supposedly had a blood testing machine that could tell you if you're going to get
[1:05:54.280 --> 1:05:58.040]  cancer, you're going to get Alzheimer's, it's like going to the old fast and video game
[1:05:58.040 --> 1:06:02.720]  arcades and have that, you know, guy with a turban on, it would like ask the great
[1:06:02.720 --> 1:06:06.720]  Karnak and you'd put in a dollar and you'd ask him a question and the wheel would spin,
[1:06:06.720 --> 1:06:07.720]  he'd tell you.
[1:06:07.720 --> 1:06:12.600]  Basically, that's what it was, but her company raised tens of billions upon billions of dollars,
[1:06:12.600 --> 1:06:13.600]  total fraud.
[1:06:13.600 --> 1:06:17.360]  And it was the inventor of the PCR test back then that said it was a similar system and
[1:06:17.360 --> 1:06:20.280]  said, you just set this however you want it, it just makes up wherever you want.
[1:06:20.280 --> 1:06:25.240]  You just put a sample in, sample of a papaya, sample of a goat, sample of blood, it just
[1:06:25.240 --> 1:06:31.680]  always says you have COVID and then it just sticks out and you're like, oh, don't question
[1:06:31.680 --> 1:06:35.840]  this, this is a, this is a robot.
[1:06:35.840 --> 1:06:39.040]  Bloomberg was pushing it because all he's ever done is sell fraud as well.
[1:06:39.040 --> 1:06:40.920]  Oh, my computer say this is going up.
[1:06:40.920 --> 1:06:46.840]  Everyone goes and buys the stock that he makes, you know, a hundred billion dollars.
[1:06:46.840 --> 1:06:50.720]  So when you wonder what COVID-19 is, it brings in global government.
[1:06:50.720 --> 1:06:53.720]  It pays hospitals for $3,000 of somebody gets intubated.
[1:06:53.720 --> 1:06:57.600]  So it pays them to say you have COVID, pays them to escalate it.
[1:06:57.600 --> 1:07:00.040]  It pays them to say other things they died of or really COVID.
[1:07:00.040 --> 1:07:01.040]  That's all admitted.
[1:07:01.040 --> 1:07:02.160]  It brings in global government.
[1:07:02.160 --> 1:07:03.160]  It brings in surveillance.
[1:07:03.160 --> 1:07:04.480]  It brings in tracking apps.
[1:07:04.480 --> 1:07:06.160]  It makes you stay in your house when they want.
[1:07:06.160 --> 1:07:08.120]  It makes small businesses go bankrupt.
[1:07:08.120 --> 1:07:12.920]  It doubles the profits of all the big tech companies and Amazon and Google and Facebook
[1:07:12.920 --> 1:07:14.080]  and Twitter and Apple.
[1:07:14.080 --> 1:07:16.360]  So it's a consolidation of power.
[1:07:16.360 --> 1:07:17.360]  It's a siege.
[1:07:17.360 --> 1:07:23.040]  You know, the old day, a tell of the hum would come into an area at Genghis Khan or the Visigoths,
[1:07:23.040 --> 1:07:26.440]  whatever group it was, and they would, they would take over the local community and steal
[1:07:26.440 --> 1:07:30.920]  all the cattle and rape and kill, but there'd be a castle and they couldn't get them that.
[1:07:30.920 --> 1:07:35.120]  So they just camp out for a year while everybody starved to death inside the castle and then
[1:07:35.120 --> 1:07:37.120]  finally gave up.
[1:07:37.120 --> 1:07:38.360]  And so you're just under siege.
[1:07:38.360 --> 1:07:46.120]  So COVID is Theranos scam and Elizabeth Holmes 2.0 and she came right out of the same group
[1:07:46.120 --> 1:07:50.640]  of people, but they went, you know, you can't just do this with one company.
[1:07:50.640 --> 1:07:55.520]  You got to do it big with a partner like Communist China to show us how to operate.
[1:07:55.520 --> 1:07:57.640]  So China says lock people up.
[1:07:57.640 --> 1:07:58.960]  China says do these swabs.
[1:07:58.960 --> 1:08:00.160]  China says do that.
[1:08:00.160 --> 1:08:02.080]  China says never reopen, even though they're reopened.
[1:08:02.080 --> 1:08:04.840]  Now they say stick a swab up your ear in, but we better do it.
[1:08:04.840 --> 1:08:05.840]  I mean, China said so.
[1:08:05.840 --> 1:08:07.560]  I mean, they're the gold standard.
[1:08:07.560 --> 1:08:08.760]  I mean, they're open for business.
[1:08:08.760 --> 1:08:14.640]  We're not Theranos founder, Elizabeth Holmes, fraud trial has a new start day.
[1:08:14.640 --> 1:08:22.160]  Theranos is reportedly closing after failing to sell itself off.
[1:08:22.160 --> 1:08:25.040]  Elizabeth Holmes, you can go read all about it.
[1:08:25.040 --> 1:08:27.880]  Now they found that it was all fraud and none of it was true.
[1:08:27.880 --> 1:08:32.880]  Why they tell people you've got cancer and then they go do all these tests and surgeries
[1:08:32.880 --> 1:08:35.120]  and chop out along brain surgery.
[1:08:35.120 --> 1:08:37.360]  They go, Well, Theranos says you've got cancer?
[1:08:37.360 --> 1:08:40.460]  Well, there's a little something there on your front lobe.
[1:08:40.460 --> 1:08:41.460]  Let's cut that off.
[1:08:41.460 --> 1:08:42.740]  You're like, Oh, thank you, doctor.
[1:08:42.740 --> 1:08:44.740]  Two days later you wake up.
[1:08:44.740 --> 1:08:48.580]  I'm not my big meter.
[1:08:48.580 --> 1:08:51.060]  I mean, liberal.
[1:08:51.060 --> 1:08:55.360]  So, oh, you take this little pill and it goes through you and you crap it out.
[1:08:55.360 --> 1:08:56.600]  It tells her everything.
[1:08:56.600 --> 1:08:59.680]  She's a cute blonde and she works for George Soros.
[1:08:59.680 --> 1:09:00.920]  So it's okay.
[1:09:00.920 --> 1:09:01.920]  So.
[1:09:01.920 --> 1:09:02.920]  okay.
[1:09:02.920 --> 1:09:03.920]  She's a woman.
[1:09:03.920 --> 1:09:09.760]  Cook runs death camps, he is gay, gay, gay. It just continues. They use these front people
[1:09:10.720 --> 1:09:16.080]  inside Elizabeth Holmes and the downfall of Theranos. The downfall, the rise and fall of
[1:09:16.080 --> 1:09:21.120]  Elizabeth Holmes, the Theranos founder whose federal fraud trial was delayed until 2021.
[1:09:23.600 --> 1:09:30.160]  Meanwhile, every facet of COVID-19 is a lie. I mean, you know, if you die on a motorcycle accident
[1:09:30.160 --> 1:09:34.080]  and you're in a blue city or state, you die out of COVID. You know, if you're 89 years old and
[1:09:34.080 --> 1:09:39.680]  die of a heart attack, you die out of COVID because they can set the little computer however they
[1:09:39.680 --> 1:09:44.720]  want. The nurse knows she gets a bonus, she comes in, she turns it up 45 times a normal cycle for 100
[1:09:44.720 --> 1:09:52.800]  percent, sticks it in. We just got 50 plus grand. Yeah. Woo. I mean, you can pay people all day.
[1:09:53.600 --> 1:09:58.400]  I can hire former Green Berets all day to kill people for $20,000. I'm not about to do it,
[1:09:58.400 --> 1:10:04.480]  but I mean, you get 50 plus thousand dollars to kill old people or homeless people. That's why so
[1:10:04.480 --> 1:10:09.680]  many are homeless. Come on in to the nest and it's all certain hospitals where they kill everybody.
[1:10:11.360 --> 1:10:18.080]  But it's okay because it's liberal continuing. So go read those reports. Overhead shot please.
[1:10:19.040 --> 1:10:26.000]  Who, chief? Theranos ran his own war crimes in Northern Africa and mass exterminated people
[1:10:26.000 --> 1:10:29.600]  who did medical crimes and covered up a million dead in cholera and wouldn't get medical aid.
[1:10:29.600 --> 1:10:32.800]  That's why he's a Marxist, Leninist, China vaccine. Well, he's now
[1:10:33.600 --> 1:10:39.360]  anointed Mike Bloomberg as global ambassador overseeing COVID-19 with Bill Gates. And wait,
[1:10:39.360 --> 1:10:43.440]  it gets better. The British Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he's the head of the G8 this year,
[1:10:43.440 --> 1:10:48.880]  2021, and that Bill Gates will be the shadow leader of the G8. All these billionaires always
[1:10:48.880 --> 1:10:54.400]  wanted to be a global leader and now they are. But he comes on TV and tells you when the lockdown
[1:10:54.400 --> 1:11:02.240]  ends because he's Bill Gates. CDC tells Americans to avoid cheering at the Super Bowl. And remember,
[1:11:02.240 --> 1:11:08.560]  wear a mask when you masturbate. Makes no sense. Is it about making sense? It's about you groveling
[1:11:08.560 --> 1:11:15.040]  to them. United Airlines CEO mandatory vaccine will become what most companies do. And the
[1:11:15.040 --> 1:11:20.640]  Texas company says no vaccine, no job, even though it doesn't protect you. Even though it
[1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:24.000]  can make you sick, even though Merck has pulled back and said the vaccine's dangerous, they're
[1:11:24.000 --> 1:11:27.760]  pulling theirs back. It doesn't matter. It's too evil to fail. Because, you see, Theranos failed as
[1:11:27.760 --> 1:11:32.880]  it was one company. But you get all the big companies involved, all of them in a big scam,
[1:11:33.440 --> 1:11:37.600]  and they will commit the mass crime too able to fail. But they have a problem. France is stopping
[1:11:37.600 --> 1:11:42.320]  the vaccine. Australia is pulling out of it because of false HIV positives. Now Merck has
[1:11:42.320 --> 1:11:48.640]  pulled out of the vaccine. So all is not happy in this house of straw because the truth is like
[1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:54.160]  the big, bad wolf. And the little piggies are inside screwing us over. Little piggies are inside
[1:11:54.160 --> 1:12:00.720]  raping us. Here comes along the big, bad wolf of truth. And he says, let me in. They say,
[1:12:00.720 --> 1:12:05.760]  not by the hair of my chin, chin, chin. So he says, well, I'll huff, and I'll puff with the truth
[1:12:05.760 --> 1:12:12.240]  and I'll blow your house down. And so big tech works around the clock to suppress and stop all
[1:12:12.240 --> 1:12:15.280]  the medical doctors and scientists coming out saying it's hoax. And they try to suppress
[1:12:15.280 --> 1:12:19.760]  Congress and they block congressional hearings and major universities and major EU advisory
[1:12:19.760 --> 1:12:24.080]  boards say the vaccine's deadly. What are they going to do? They don't know what to do. Meanwhile,
[1:12:24.080 --> 1:12:29.280]  Isle of Man scraps lockdown, mass rules, social distancing, return to near normal, says it doesn't
[1:12:29.280 --> 1:12:35.680]  work. Anthony Cooney, a big syndicated talk show host, kind of as a friend of mine, he is coming
[1:12:35.680 --> 1:12:40.000]  up on the other side to talk about the waterfront or anything else. Plus I love where he's at. Looks
[1:12:40.000 --> 1:12:45.760]  like some like super fancy wasp facility. Like I'm in a space station up here on the moon with Elon
[1:12:45.760 --> 1:12:51.600]  Musk. He's like hanging out with Judge Smales. So we'll be right back. Stay with us. I've got some
[1:12:51.600 --> 1:12:56.080]  bad news. Our best selling vitamin mineral fusion has sold out because people understand

[1:13:00.560 --> 1:13:07.040]  But here's the good news. Tumeric acts in very similar ways and is so good for inflammation,
[1:13:07.040 --> 1:13:12.400]  so good for your immune system. And we've got two great turmeric formulas. One is body's ultimate

[1:13:55.440 --> 1:13:58.720]  Man, I'm just working as hard as I can. We're in such a critical time. Brother. How are you?
[1:13:58.720 --> 1:14:04.880]  I love you, man. I want to make a quick plug that DNA force. I love it. I've been using it quite a
[1:14:04.880 --> 1:14:09.840]  while and I just went looked at the ingredients again the other day and I see that it contains
[1:14:09.840 --> 1:14:18.160]  quercetin, which according to some published studies that Dr. Merkala has cited is an ionophore
[1:14:18.160 --> 1:14:24.240]  similar to hydroxychloroquine. And it helps channel the zinc into the cells. So people might
[1:14:24.240 --> 1:14:30.800]  want to take a look at that. All I know is with DNA force, we went out and looked at these high end
[1:14:30.800 --> 1:14:35.200]  products that they sell through doctor clinics that aren't prescription, but the doctor sells
[1:14:35.200 --> 1:14:38.800]  like 300 bucks a bottle because there's a lot of expensive product and it's really only cost them
[1:14:38.800 --> 1:14:44.000]  like 50 bucks. And so we basically cloned two different top brands together and that's what
[1:14:44.000 --> 1:14:56.800]  produced this. So thanks. Thanks for the plug. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:14:56.800 --> 1:15:16.480]  And now Anthony Cumia of compoundmedia.com at the Cumia show on Twitter joining us from rallying
[1:15:16.480 --> 1:15:24.480]  Patriots worldwide in defense of human liberty. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. I'm coming
[1:15:24.480 --> 1:15:29.840]  to you from Elon Musk moon base. He's coming to you from Judd Smell's house. They're at the main
[1:15:29.840 --> 1:15:35.440]  caddy shack. Of course. Actually, I love that house. He's that's his house. You know, like the
[1:15:35.440 --> 1:15:39.520]  Queen of England's about to walk in any moment. I like it actually. I told my wife you want to
[1:15:39.520 --> 1:15:44.320]  remodel the house. I said, I don't like green walls and brown wood. She goes, you don't get that.
[1:15:44.320 --> 1:15:49.120]  So I'm marrying Anthony Cumia. Seriously, that's what my house will look like. It says like pink
[1:15:49.120 --> 1:15:55.360]  walls and stuff like pink pillows and like white person cats. But anyway, seriously, Anthony
[1:15:55.360 --> 1:15:59.680]  Cumia is a great guy. He had the number one talk show host of terrestrial radio that kicked him
[1:15:59.680 --> 1:16:04.400]  off the number one on XM that kicked him off the show. Now he kicks ass at compoundmedia.com
[1:16:04.400 --> 1:16:09.600]  and he's in New York, which is crazy, great people, but horrible government. Cuomo's under
[1:16:09.600 --> 1:16:14.480]  investigation covering up more thousands of dead. So my friend, good to see you again. I'm glad
[1:16:14.480 --> 1:16:19.840]  you're on with us. Oh my God, Alex. Great to see you. I've been keeping tabs on everything you've
[1:16:19.840 --> 1:16:26.160]  been doing, tearing it up as usual. I love it. Yeah, I'm here in the United Soviet Socialist
[1:16:26.160 --> 1:16:34.080]  Republic of New York. It's just an abomination. Now you thought it was bad. Everyone thought it
[1:16:34.080 --> 1:16:40.720]  was bad for a while. It is so bad. I'm leaving this beautiful house and this wonderful office
[1:16:40.720 --> 1:16:45.680]  that I have. I will be leaving behind. I can't take it anymore. I'm putting my money where my
[1:16:45.680 --> 1:16:52.640]  mouth is. My house is up for sale. I am getting the hell out of this state. I'm finally doing it.
[1:16:52.640 --> 1:16:56.240]  Well, I don't normally get into how houses look, but that's actually what I like. And I've never
[1:16:56.240 --> 1:16:59.600]  been able to actually convince my ex-wife or my current wife to have the house look like that.
[1:16:59.600 --> 1:17:04.480]  What do you call that like English gentleman? That looks badass. Yeah, yeah, it really, I just
[1:17:04.480 --> 1:17:10.560]  wanted it to look like offices I had seen on the shows I grew up with, you know, Perry Mason
[1:17:10.560 --> 1:17:17.920]  and all that stuff. So I wanted it to be the dark wood and the green walls and whatnot.
[1:17:17.920 --> 1:17:24.400]  And yeah, I like it. It's much, it's out of my pay grade. Like it looks a lot better than, you
[1:17:24.400 --> 1:17:33.440]  know, I'm sitting here with my assault rifle shirts on and, you know, maybe a little whiskey.
[1:17:33.440 --> 1:17:37.040]  But for the most part. Let me tell you a room like that makes me want to drink whiskey. But
[1:17:37.040 --> 1:17:40.560]  getting serious, a lot of topics you want to get into the lockdown first. What's your take on it?
[1:17:41.680 --> 1:17:48.960]  The lockdown, especially here in New York has destroyed the one of the most,
[1:17:50.480 --> 1:17:54.800]  I guess, the biggest city in the world, the most lucrative city.
[1:17:54.800 --> 1:18:01.200]  Giuliani had made New York as much of a paradise as it could be. Tourists were coming here,
[1:18:01.200 --> 1:18:08.960]  everything. And then now we have Mayor de Blasio and Governor Cuomo. They have shut down
[1:18:09.520 --> 1:18:15.760]  New York City to the point where there is not one productive person walking the street. This is
[1:18:15.760 --> 1:18:23.600]  like something out of a zombie movie. It's it's addicts and homeless and criminals
[1:18:23.600 --> 1:18:31.520]  roaming the streets every day. There's an increase in violent crime. And the restaurants are all
[1:18:31.520 --> 1:18:37.840]  shut down. So these businesses, we just had a blizzard here a couple of days ago. And they're
[1:18:37.840 --> 1:18:44.560]  saying, well, you got to eat outside, eat outside. No one is dining outside in New York City. I don't
[1:18:44.560 --> 1:18:50.960]  know how these restaurants after just about a year are still open. A lot of them have closed down.
[1:18:50.960 --> 1:18:56.240]  I've tried to frequent some of them as much as I can. Some of the local ones around my studio.
[1:18:56.240 --> 1:19:02.880]  And the truth of the matter is, you just can't do it. They've made it impossible to support these
[1:19:02.880 --> 1:19:06.240]  local businesses. And I saw you talk about this a few weeks ago in a clip. That's why I actually
[1:19:06.240 --> 1:19:10.320]  thought I'd get you on. You were talking about that that local restaurant on staff dared to open
[1:19:10.320 --> 1:19:16.720]  so they like broke in arrested the guy, beat him up. I mean, this is crazy. It's unbelievable
[1:19:16.720 --> 1:19:24.480]  what they're doing. This went from 15 days to flatten the curve. And we recommend you wear
[1:19:24.480 --> 1:19:32.640]  a mask to these laws that are being enforced that aren't laws by people that have no business
[1:19:32.640 --> 1:19:41.040]  enforcing any laws. Agencies appointed people. No one voted on these laws. They don't represent
[1:19:41.040 --> 1:19:50.320]  the people yet. They just put put us under these these draconian regulations where you're not allowed
[1:19:50.320 --> 1:19:58.640]  to leave your house and go to work. This is such a basic thing for Americans. This is so basic as
[1:19:58.640 --> 1:20:05.760]  far as the American dream goes. You get yourself a job. You start a small business. You cultivate
[1:20:05.760 --> 1:20:11.440]  it and make something of it. They have put a stop to it and not a stop where they recommend
[1:20:11.440 --> 1:20:16.320]  like I said, the recommend you do this or that they are enforcing these things. You can't open
[1:20:16.320 --> 1:20:21.760]  your business. You can't earn a living. You can't send your kid to school. You can't leave your house
[1:20:21.760 --> 1:20:28.240]  and congregate or go to dinner. These are all such basic things that most Americans have seemed to
[1:20:28.240 --> 1:20:33.600]  just throw away. Let me ask you this. Okay. Well, what do you think the motive is because I mean,
[1:20:33.600 --> 1:20:37.600]  I know so many people that are New Yorkers. Great people. Like when I was a kid, I went to New York.
[1:20:37.600 --> 1:20:41.840]  It was a great city. It was kind of scary when Giuliani ran it was like the best city ever. I love
[1:20:41.840 --> 1:20:45.680]  the energy, the food. Just everything was fun. Everything was great. And then you've watched
[1:20:45.680 --> 1:20:49.440]  it rot the last few years and garbage and rats. The last time I was there, I was like, God,
[1:20:49.440 --> 1:20:52.720]  this place has gone down even like five years ago. Then I was there a year ago. I was like,
[1:20:52.720 --> 1:20:59.200]  man, this place is in trouble. And now I'm told it's even more hellish. It is crazy now. Here's
[1:20:59.200 --> 1:21:06.400]  what I think the issue is and what they're trying to do. Democrats, liberals, what have you,
[1:21:06.400 --> 1:21:13.440]  they love you to need them. You have to need them. They can't stand when you're standing on
[1:21:13.440 --> 1:21:18.640]  your own two feet. You run your own business. You're self-sufficient. You have your family and
[1:21:18.640 --> 1:21:26.560]  they're doing fine. They hate that because they need to be in your crap every day. They need
[1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:34.960]  to to dangle $600 in front of your face so that you're begging for it. And people that work for
[1:21:34.960 --> 1:21:42.080]  a living and have made them made something of themselves, they don't do that. Now they've shut
[1:21:42.080 --> 1:21:47.760]  it down. They're getting more people. Do you see how the American public are reacting to them
[1:21:47.760 --> 1:21:53.200]  dangling money in front of their face? Oh, where's the $1,400? Oh, they're begging like
[1:21:53.200 --> 1:22:02.160]  train seals. $1,400. They're begging like train seals. Yes, like train seals. That's
[1:22:02.160 --> 1:22:10.000]  what they've made us do. They've made people beg for $1,400. It's been a year in this crap.
[1:22:10.000 --> 1:22:16.880]  And they after a while gave us six and now $1,400, which they still haven't given. They're
[1:22:16.880 --> 1:22:22.480]  arguing about that with this blithering idiot in the White House now and all his appointees that
[1:22:22.480 --> 1:22:30.800]  look like a freak show from the circus. It's bedlam. And they need you to say, please help us. My
[1:22:30.800 --> 1:22:36.080]  children are hungry. We can't pay the rent. We can't. And they figured out how to do it. It's
[1:22:36.080 --> 1:22:41.360]  astounding. They figured out how to do. I had a lot more faith in the American people. I thought
[1:22:41.360 --> 1:22:47.200]  they would rebel a lot sooner. I thought they would never put up with what they put on us
[1:22:47.200 --> 1:22:54.160]  for a year now. But we just seem to go with it. It's very disappointing. Well, we're going to come
[1:22:54.160 --> 1:22:58.400]  back in a longer segment and talk about that. But they hit us like you said, though. I mean,
[1:22:58.400 --> 1:23:02.480]  if the Japanese or the Russians or whoever attacked us, we kicked their ass. The thing is,
[1:23:02.480 --> 1:23:06.640]  it's like, oh, just be nice to be a hero for 15 days. And it's all two months and then six months.
[1:23:06.640 --> 1:23:12.000]  And oh, well, and see, they just kind of, it's that it's cult programming. They have used cult
[1:23:12.000 --> 1:23:16.480]  programming to manipulate our good side to get us under peer pressure to think, okay,
[1:23:16.480 --> 1:23:20.240]  I'll give something up. So because we believe we're giving it up for a greater good,
[1:23:20.240 --> 1:23:24.080]  now we're willing to do more and more. But all these Democrats caught out partying and
[1:23:24.080 --> 1:23:28.480]  not wearing masks. That's their Achilles heel. Let's talk about how we get out of this with
[1:23:28.480 --> 1:23:32.960]  Anthony Comey of compound media on the other side and get into a bunch of other issues as well. And
[1:23:32.960 --> 1:23:38.000]  the military and DC and Joe Biden, the inoculation is not working. And so much more on Alex Jones
[1:23:38.000 --> 1:23:48.480]  within foe wars.com. They hope you don't share that URL will be right back in compound media.com. Stay with us.
[1:23:48.480 --> 1:23:54.000]  The pope came out yesterday and announced a global government corporate alliance to redistribute wealth
[1:23:54.000 --> 1:23:58.880]  and create a planetary universal income, which of course the United Nations and global corporations
[1:23:58.880 --> 1:24:03.440]  will control through the apps on your phone and finally a chip under your skin. It's all now
[1:24:03.440 --> 1:24:10.400]  completely official part of the UN great reset of the Davos group and cloud Schwab, all officially
[1:24:10.400 --> 1:24:14.880]  written about in hundreds of books by Schwab and Rockefeller Foundation, all the rest of them at
[1:24:14.880 --> 1:24:21.280]  10 to 21, 20 to 2030. It's here and only gets worse like being fed into a wood chipper or a meat grinder
[1:24:21.280 --> 1:24:27.520]  until you reject it all. And the rejection starts with realizing it's spiritual battle,
[1:24:27.520 --> 1:24:33.520]  good versus evil and stopping abortion. We must start valuing human life again. We must start
[1:24:33.520 --> 1:24:40.480]  saying that we are not expendable, that we are not disposable, that we are essential. Until we do
[1:24:40.480 --> 1:24:46.080]  that, we are all slaves. We must stand up and declare our basic God given human rights now.
[1:24:49.440 --> 1:24:54.640]  President Trump won in a landslide on November 3rd. But the globalists weren't gonna let that
[1:24:54.640 --> 1:25:00.800]  happen. They had to have some way to repudiate the populist movement emanating from the United
[1:25:00.800 --> 1:25:07.120]  States and it spread across the world from the UK to Brazil. They were desperate, they admitted
[1:25:07.120 --> 1:25:12.400]  their own publications, they didn't know what to do. And so they put out 80 million fake ballots,
[1:25:12.400 --> 1:25:18.480]  violated state law and stole it better than dollars. And now they're coming after the president,
[1:25:18.480 --> 1:25:22.720]  they're coming after you, they're coming after me, they're shutting everybody off the internet,
[1:25:22.720 --> 1:25:27.360]  they're trying to totally censor us. And that's why M4Wars is still in the fight because we knew

[1:27:12.720 --> 1:27:25.040]  This is what this comes down to is all the crazy stuff I talked about you talked about it's all
[1:27:25.040 --> 1:27:29.440]  been proven now it's out in the open so as bad as all this is and I get your piss at your fellow
[1:27:29.440 --> 1:27:35.200]  Americans so am I they were inducted into it incrementally successive approximation but wow
[1:27:36.480 --> 1:27:40.400]  is it this an adventure it sucks to leave your office it sucks to leave New York it sucks to
[1:27:40.400 --> 1:27:44.640]  see it happening but it's still an incredible adventure and what's going to happen to all the
[1:27:44.640 --> 1:27:50.000]  people that went along with this crazy directives of Bill Gates I mean who died and make this guy
[1:27:50.000 --> 1:27:57.600]  king of the world it's amazing the the way these heads of these corporations have become
[1:27:58.320 --> 1:28:06.160]  the government they are they are much more important to our day-to-day lives than the
[1:28:06.160 --> 1:28:14.640]  government is they're the ones running our lives they're in it every day we order things online
[1:28:14.640 --> 1:28:20.320]  are they made it so our food has to be dropped off at our front door by these companies and
[1:28:21.920 --> 1:28:28.320]  we're a lot less self-sufficient and it's like I said earlier they they need us to need them so
[1:28:28.320 --> 1:28:37.200]  when you got people like Bill Gates and companies like Amazon these are your new overlords they're
[1:28:37.200 --> 1:28:43.840]  the ones that tell you what you can and can't say and who you can and can't say it to you know Alex
[1:28:43.840 --> 1:28:50.400]  you've been thrown off a more social media probably than I have and a lot of the people that are
[1:28:50.400 --> 1:28:56.800]  saying speaking the truth have their eyes wide open are the ones getting thrown off of places
[1:28:56.800 --> 1:29:02.720]  like Twitter and then they go oh make your own social media platform well someone tried with
[1:29:02.720 --> 1:29:10.560]  parlor and you saw what happened there they shut that down it's so blatantly obvious I don't know
[1:29:10.560 --> 1:29:16.480]  who isn't seeing this for what it is and why they just capitulate to it and what I think is going
[1:29:16.480 --> 1:29:23.120]  to happen to them eventually their eyes will open they're going to look around and go what the hell
[1:29:23.120 --> 1:29:29.520]  have we let happen to this great former great country of ours I'm very pessimistic Alex because
[1:29:29.520 --> 1:29:36.480]  I've I've seen the way as long as we have the bare minimum of creature comforts we're willing to give
[1:29:36.480 --> 1:29:44.720]  up rights that people have fought and died for that we've had for a couple of centuries and
[1:29:45.360 --> 1:29:50.480]  they're just willing to give them all away just as long as maybe I have a tattered blanket
[1:29:50.480 --> 1:29:54.720]  and a cracker well Anthony let's talk about that because I'm not trying to say you're wonderful
[1:29:54.720 --> 1:29:58.240]  or I'm wonderful but my dad cared about freedom still does I'm sure you must have been instilled
[1:29:58.240 --> 1:30:02.960]  by you that's an American value people came here because they were fleeing oppression
[1:30:02.960 --> 1:30:06.800]  people used to say hey you better value this country you better fight for this and now overnight
[1:30:06.800 --> 1:30:11.760]  it's just all gone and then the prosperity goes what are these people gonna do when they realize
[1:30:11.760 --> 1:30:15.200]  that all the prosperity is gone because they didn't stand up for freedom I mean you gotta
[1:30:15.200 --> 1:30:22.960]  territorially defend your basic rights I that is a great question Alex with no answer I don't
[1:30:22.960 --> 1:30:31.840]  know if there seems to be a lot of genuine patriots in this country obviously at least 70 80 million
[1:30:31.840 --> 1:30:40.000]  of them voted for Donald Trump that whole movement of being proud of your nation and but they're cut
[1:30:40.000 --> 1:30:45.040]  off by the corporations it's big media big tech big corporations they own everything so they can
[1:30:45.040 --> 1:30:52.320]  gaslight us so how do we break through that boy you know I've said it on my show quite a few times
[1:30:52.320 --> 1:30:58.640]  and people have gotten pretty nervous we're we're getting very close to the point we're talking
[1:30:59.280 --> 1:31:08.240]  and being civil just won't work anymore you could speculate what that means they are trying to
[1:31:08.240 --> 1:31:15.040]  infringe on a lot of our our rights and one of those being the second amendment and and I think we
[1:31:15.040 --> 1:31:19.760]  know what their reasoning is they don't want to be in the crosshairs if you look back at history
[1:31:20.480 --> 1:31:26.160]  you'll see a lot of these crooked politicians and traders and treasonous people were treated
[1:31:27.040 --> 1:31:35.920]  with the the the utmost the utmost violence as a husband on that you have hr 127 that gets
[1:31:35.920 --> 1:31:40.880]  for the due process this is just a department without law decide who can own a gun decide what
[1:31:40.880 --> 1:31:46.160]  psychological parameters or test you must take to get a gun arbitrarily this is making the head
[1:31:46.160 --> 1:31:50.640]  of the justice department a dictator over our guns over our mental health and they call the
[1:31:50.640 --> 1:31:54.800]  capital riot which was a few hundred idiots out of hundreds of thousands of peaceful people
[1:31:55.600 --> 1:31:59.760]  getting shot and killed for breaking and stealing a few things the majority walked through the
[1:31:59.760 --> 1:32:04.000]  velvet robes now they've got permanent troops there they're saying because they're calling it
[1:32:04.000 --> 1:32:12.880]  the new pearl harbor of this is ridiculous the the media is the most despicable thing about
[1:32:12.880 --> 1:32:18.720]  this country right now we at least knew the politicians were pieces of garbage we we knew
[1:32:18.720 --> 1:32:26.320]  the media was biased in the past but what they have done the past four years or so while president
[1:32:26.320 --> 1:32:35.440]  trump was in office and what they're doing now is pure soviet era task news agency communism
[1:32:35.440 --> 1:32:43.200]  censorship just plain outright lying for the state that's what they're doing and again this
[1:32:43.200 --> 1:32:48.800]  should be obvious to everybody but there are people so brainwashed the i love the we're not
[1:32:48.800 --> 1:32:53.520]  taking your guns away don't worry we're not taking your guns and then i read about these
[1:32:53.520 --> 1:33:00.480]  rules that you know what's her name jackson lee there is is trying to enact a bill that has
[1:33:00.480 --> 1:33:07.600]  yeah red flags you have to take a mental evaluation well that sounds vague that sounds pretty arbitrary
[1:33:07.600 --> 1:33:15.040]  that they could take anyone's guns at any time for an accusation these are things i'll show you
[1:33:15.040 --> 1:33:22.640]  right here every every room in my smells house has a weapon in it i i keep them nearby because
[1:33:22.640 --> 1:33:27.280]  i don't know hey i like how the shotgun shells are green and match that badass to court that is

[1:34:00.480 --> 1:34:05.920]  amendment to say that no one is allowed to have guns we'll repeal it it doesn't happen that way
[1:34:05.920 --> 1:34:11.840]  look how everything is presented to you when they're taking away a right it's a protection act

[1:41:48.400 --> 1:41:53.600]  makes me want to beat people's asses so getting on air is therapeutic for me speaking of that
[1:41:53.600 --> 1:41:56.640]  ass you're in the break you don't mind telling folks where you're moving you're leaving new
[1:41:56.640 --> 1:42:00.960]  york talk about it where are you going because as much as i like texas all the californians are
[1:42:00.960 --> 1:42:04.800]  coming here driving up prices where if i can't pay for it the average guy must be in trouble
[1:42:04.800 --> 1:42:13.120]  yeah absolutely i'm going to uh south carolina uh my sister already moved down there uh a few
[1:42:13.120 --> 1:42:19.120]  other members of my family are seriously thinking about it i can't stand paying the amount of
[1:42:19.120 --> 1:42:26.480]  taxes i pay in the state of new york to just get screwed to just get screwed at every turn they
[1:42:26.480 --> 1:42:35.520]  they are in your pockets they're up your keister every single day there's something that quomo
[1:42:35.520 --> 1:42:41.600]  and deblazio and all these other politicians in new york uh they and they're going to be
[1:42:41.600 --> 1:42:46.640]  hurting alex they i don't know where they're going to get their revenue from all the people that are
[1:42:46.640 --> 1:42:52.080]  contributing to new york state and especially new york city are leaving and i understand some of
[1:42:52.080 --> 1:42:56.480]  the people you know they think biden's gonna unjustly give them like double the bailout the other
[1:42:56.480 --> 1:43:01.600]  states i think that's the plan well that was what they were worried about with trump because
[1:43:01.600 --> 1:43:06.720]  trump was telling him screw you i'm not giving you money to make up and pay for the mistakes you've
[1:43:06.720 --> 1:43:13.360]  made over the course of the years uh but now of course uh biden oh he's just gonna deal it out
[1:43:13.360 --> 1:43:18.880]  and quomo will be uh fine in new york he'll be able to have all this little pet projects and sign
[1:43:18.880 --> 1:43:23.840]  his midnight legislation or rip your rights away like he's done uh since he's been in office
[1:43:23.840 --> 1:43:29.680]  the whole family him the the one on cnn his father all pieces of garbage that have just
[1:43:29.680 --> 1:43:35.520]  destroyed uh new york and i won't play the video but and i interrupt you the other point
[1:43:35.520 --> 1:43:40.160]  you don't make it make it i want to hear it but remember when he made the comments so what if
[1:43:40.160 --> 1:43:44.400]  you know four thousand people died now it's 12 000 plus he covered it up why does he's so
[1:43:44.400 --> 1:43:49.600]  freaking arrogant like i'm a tough guy man i'm on a wimp and if i killed 12 000 innocent people i'd
[1:43:49.600 --> 1:43:54.000]  be apologizing saying it was a mistake i sure as hell wouldn't be saying so what because i'd be afraid
[1:43:54.000 --> 1:44:01.200]  somebody's gonna come kill my ass he wrote a book about how great he handled the covid thing oh yeah
[1:44:01.200 --> 1:44:06.160]  in the middle of it like before it was over it's not over now it's it's still in full effect and
[1:44:06.160 --> 1:44:11.840]  he wrote a book how great a job he did one of my favorite things we talked about on the show
[1:44:11.840 --> 1:44:17.600]  early on in this covid nonsense he uh he was talking about masks people needed masks the first
[1:44:17.600 --> 1:44:23.440]  responders everybody and then i guess people civilians sent him homemade masks to give out
[1:44:23.440 --> 1:44:29.200]  to these people he made a mural of them and and show them it's like no dummy this was supposed
[1:44:29.200 --> 1:44:33.600]  to be so people could wear masks if they want to you know when when we still thought that was a
[1:44:33.600 --> 1:44:42.880]  thing remember the weird mural he made where he's the hero yes yeah it's just this guy is terrible
[1:44:42.880 --> 1:44:50.080]  and de Blasio in new york is even worse this guy's a full-fledged communist and he wants nothing to
[1:44:50.080 --> 1:44:55.920]  do with americans being able to take care of themselves and be self-sufficient uh he wants to
[1:44:55.920 --> 1:45:01.840]  be king his wife lost billions of dollars no one questions it no one's able to go she she was in
[1:45:01.840 --> 1:45:08.640]  charge of one of these programs uh and the money just disappeared no one is able to account for it
[1:45:08.640 --> 1:45:14.000]  and that's the the city we live in sounds like bernie sanders sounds like a bernie sanders does
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:18.800]  yeah yeah exactly and and that's why i'm getting out of here and there's some of these states they're
[1:45:18.800 --> 1:45:23.440]  getting uh a little angry they're like hey don't bring your garbage down here by the way nothing
[1:45:23.440 --> 1:45:29.440]  against dudes that want to have nipple rings but that's really creepy on him i really is he he's
[1:45:29.440 --> 1:45:35.440]  probably a total degenerate he's probably a complete degenerate and because every time
[1:45:35.440 --> 1:45:42.000]  people talk to him he is arrogant nasty and uh and it seems like he's hiding something that's
[1:45:42.000 --> 1:45:46.080]  what i think anyway well we got about five minutes left and i'm blown away here everything you're
[1:45:46.080 --> 1:45:50.720]  saying is totally on target gut level as a smart guy what do you see happening because obviously
[1:45:50.720 --> 1:45:55.920]  trump won to create a huge nostalgia democrats even admit his movement stronger than ever the
[1:45:55.920 --> 1:46:00.880]  populism i mean no and and now this trials all gonna fall apart the senate i mean this is a
[1:46:00.880 --> 1:46:08.000]  circus oh yeah it is a circus and and enough people have to open their eyes uh i've seen it happen
[1:46:08.000 --> 1:46:14.400]  where people um i don't think you're gonna get those hardcore lefties that watch cnn and actually
[1:46:14.400 --> 1:46:20.720]  believe it but there are a lot of people that you know we're in it alex every day we're fighting
[1:46:20.720 --> 1:46:27.600]  and we're we're on uh our shows uh telling people we have to keep informed the majority of americans
[1:46:27.600 --> 1:46:33.440]  really are pretty apathetic uh but when they start seeing their their freedoms taken away
[1:46:33.440 --> 1:46:39.760]  and their livelihoods taken away they will wake up we will we have a greatly divided nation i think
[1:46:39.760 --> 1:46:45.760]  it will further divide and one side of the other has to come out on top of this thing i don't know
[1:46:45.760 --> 1:46:51.760]  how i don't know how it transpires is it a literally a bloody revolution that takes place
[1:46:51.760 --> 1:46:58.880]  or or do enough people wake up where they start voting these people out although i don't think the
[1:46:58.880 --> 1:47:05.280]  the elections mean anything anymore after the last one and that uh crock that happened i absolutely
[1:47:05.280 --> 1:47:10.000]  well that's the problem they're trying to codify with hr one all the fraud because the states are
[1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:14.560]  moving to say you can't just outside law say have these fake bill and ballots so the states are
[1:47:14.560 --> 1:47:18.880]  asserting the constitution so the democrats want to now say we're federalizing the elections
[1:47:18.880 --> 1:47:24.800]  we're federalizing medicine we've got a whole stack here we're federalizing dc uh we are federalizing
[1:47:25.680 --> 1:47:32.080]  kory booker wants to federalize college sports did you see that oh my god of course he's a he
[1:47:32.080 --> 1:47:40.480]  is a blithering idiot that man is a dope and and and how how is it that people there's anybody
[1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:46.560]  that doesn't believe that shenanigans were happening when no way trump was losing before
[1:47:46.560 --> 1:47:52.560]  covid the economy booming everyone's doing well i mean you mean you mean like if i black the windows
[1:47:52.560 --> 1:47:56.640]  out kick everybody out say a water main broke that i pulled suitcases out start running the
[1:47:56.640 --> 1:48:01.920]  same ballots over and over again nothing's going on oh it's been proven uh that that didn't happen
[1:48:01.920 --> 1:48:07.360]  it's been debunked who told you that oh the news that lies and is in bed with the the left and
[1:48:07.360 --> 1:48:13.680]  and the democrats they they you're right by censoring trump and by doing the mail in ballots
[1:48:13.680 --> 1:48:18.480]  and by what what uh you know famously bill mar said we need to kill the economy to hurt trump
[1:48:18.480 --> 1:48:22.880]  that was all the election meddling right there he still probably won the fraud you know stopped it
[1:48:22.880 --> 1:48:26.320]  but you're right if they wouldn't have done that his landslide would have been so big they couldn't
[1:48:26.320 --> 1:48:33.920]  stopped it exactly even without fraud the way the media ran a smear campaign on trump for four years
[1:48:33.920 --> 1:48:41.840]  and and treated biden like like a king the way the media lied about and didn't mention trump's
[1:48:41.840 --> 1:48:47.200]  many accomplishments all this thing the economy minorities working at levels that had never
[1:48:47.200 --> 1:48:53.760]  been seen before in this country the only way you were getting him out was to destroy the economy
[1:48:53.760 --> 1:48:59.440]  in such a quick period of time because they didn't have much time to do it that's covid and then
[1:48:59.440 --> 1:49:05.280]  have an election like we've never had it before with all these mail in ballots that had been
[1:49:05.280 --> 1:49:11.680]  proven even in local elections to be susceptible to fraud and then we're supposed to just say
[1:49:11.680 --> 1:49:16.560]  believe because the news tells us that there wasn't any fraud without any investigation
[1:49:16.560 --> 1:49:20.640]  they don't want to investigate they don't want to look into it but they're gonna tell you that
[1:49:20.640 --> 1:49:28.240]  there wasn't any fraud and again even without the fraud the way the media acted and and the way uh uh
[1:49:28.240 --> 1:49:34.320]  the liberals and and the democrats uh impeached trump and all this garbage over four years and all
[1:49:34.320 --> 1:49:39.120]  the attempted coups all the attempted coups and and like going back prep said it they said in
[1:49:39.120 --> 1:49:43.600]  wisconsin in michigan he's behind 20 points he's behind 17 points those were all to make people

[1:54:28.560 --> 1:54:39.440]  is important
[1:54:42.160 --> 1:54:48.880]  governor ronda santis of florida is doing what trump should have done he has laid out
[1:54:48.880 --> 1:54:56.880]  in a powerful 45-minute speech posted below in the links that the big tech companies have set up a
[1:54:56.880 --> 1:55:03.840]  monopoly a political corporate and financial control over america and are acting as an organized
[1:55:03.840 --> 1:55:09.920]  crime syndicate imagine if big telecoms would have spied on their users and then censored them
[1:55:09.920 --> 1:55:14.800]  people would put up with it imagine if any other sector of government would have done this there
[1:55:14.800 --> 1:55:21.360]  would be a revolution but because big tech is acting as if it's a corporate government outside
[1:55:21.360 --> 1:55:27.440]  of law they've gotten away with it big tech on record admits that they spy on you from spotify
[1:55:28.400 --> 1:55:34.160]  to facebook to google to twitter over the microphones on your phones and computers
[1:55:34.160 --> 1:55:38.880]  samson years ago said in their terms of service you buy our smart tv watch what you say and do
[1:55:38.880 --> 1:55:46.080]  third parties are listening and watching you big tech because it's new has gotten away with everything
[1:55:46.080 --> 1:55:53.360]  under the sun and now governor santis has come out in a major bullet point plan and declared
[1:55:54.080 --> 1:56:00.560]  not war because big tech already attacked us but declared defense against this this is everything
[1:56:00.560 --> 1:56:05.440]  we need to see leadership wise so trump did an okay job but not as good as the santis actually
[1:56:05.440 --> 1:56:09.360]  taking action pretty obvious now though even the president's been censored the former president
[1:56:10.960 --> 1:56:14.880]  but who really did a bad job trump's not the villain here he just should have done it
[1:56:14.880 --> 1:56:21.600]  but it's the governor of texas greg abin i mean he is in the pocket of apple and google and facebook
[1:56:21.600 --> 1:56:27.760]  and twitter that have all moved here he is going on with mask forever he is going along with the
[1:56:27.760 --> 1:56:33.040]  inoculations all of it the santis is the one leading the way out of this saying basically
[1:56:33.040 --> 1:56:38.160]  covid's and overblown hoax that they're counting the flu deaths the deaths from pneumonia gunshots
[1:56:38.160 --> 1:56:43.680]  car wrecks motorcycle accidents cancer is that and that's the type of leader we need we need the
[1:56:43.680 --> 1:56:50.240]  santis to be the president 2024 this is the type of person i will support for president this is the
[1:56:50.240 --> 1:56:53.840]  type of leadership we need and i want to see other leaders like the south dakota governor
[1:56:54.800 --> 1:57:00.240]  run for senate or run for vice president but they can't wait they've got a rally americans now
[1:57:00.240 --> 1:57:06.240]  i wish greg abin was a good guy he's not he knows all these facts i know people that know him
[1:57:06.240 --> 1:57:10.320]  but he's decided to go along with claus schwaab and bill gates the great recent so there's an
[1:57:10.320 --> 1:57:15.040]  article in fours dot com that has the full video governor de santis unveils crackdown against big
[1:57:15.040 --> 1:57:21.360]  tech cartel over rampant censorship and that's it this is beyond just censorship this is a cartel
[1:57:21.360 --> 1:57:26.720]  that spies on you that controls you that gets political money and foreign money to suppress
[1:57:26.720 --> 1:57:32.480]  american patriots and nationalists they promote communist chinese propaganda and iranian propaganda
[1:57:32.480 --> 1:57:37.200]  and saudi arabian propaganda and hollywood propaganda and e u propaganda but everybody
[1:57:37.200 --> 1:57:41.120]  that's nationalistic everybody's patriotic everybody that's american in common sense
[1:57:42.320 --> 1:57:47.280]  we're muzzled we're silence we are shut down so here's some of the things that he laid out in
[1:57:47.280 --> 1:57:53.360]  his speech mandatory op-outs for big tech content filters a solution to tech censorship a private
[1:57:53.360 --> 1:57:57.520]  right of action for ferridian residents against tech companies that violate and the condition
[1:57:58.080 --> 1:58:02.960]  fines of a hundred thousand per day levy on tech companies that suspend candidates
[1:58:02.960 --> 1:58:07.600]  for elected office in florida from their platforms that's the big election meddling like laura
[1:58:07.600 --> 1:58:13.760]  lumar and others but they're doing it to even make mainline senators elect senators that are
[1:58:13.760 --> 1:58:18.080]  already in office who are incumbents they're even blocking senators and house members i mean this is
[1:58:18.080 --> 1:58:24.800]  bold daily fines for any tech company that uses their content and user related algorithms to
[1:58:24.800 --> 1:58:29.760]  suppress or promote access to any of content related to a political candidate or cause on
[1:58:29.760 --> 1:58:35.280]  the ballot greater transparency requirements disclosure of requirements enforced by florida's

[2:01:15.280 --> 2:01:20.880]  incels unhappy people uh i mean wow this is little guys doing what big guys have done with
[2:01:20.880 --> 2:01:25.600]  his short squeeze and so i want to get his take on that on i'm a rocket scientist but i said early
[2:01:25.600 --> 2:01:29.680]  last week i said i bet silver just explodes once people figure out that real short squeeze and now
[2:01:29.680 --> 2:01:33.840]  it's happening they can't keep up with physical demand people are demanding physical we'll we'll
[2:01:33.840 --> 2:01:37.920]  cover the waterfront because even if you're not invested in the stock market this affects everything
[2:01:37.920 --> 2:01:43.680]  with gregory manorino so thanks for coming on with us my friend alex is great to be here it's
[2:01:43.680 --> 2:01:48.560]  about time i'm glad we're finally getting together with the truth well it's great to have you here
[2:01:48.560 --> 2:01:54.000]  where do you want to start you're a smart guy what's really going on right now well i'll tell you uh i
[2:01:54.000 --> 2:01:58.480]  almost don't know where to begin let me just set the scene for everyone so so they can understand
[2:01:58.480 --> 2:02:05.520]  my take on it we are now in the biggest freak show in the history of the world there's nothing
[2:02:05.520 --> 2:02:10.800]  that even comes close to this with regard to the financial markets i mean it's it's gotten to a point
[2:02:10.800 --> 2:02:20.160]  of pure rigging pure manipulation it's in our face uh people are trying to rise up and do something
[2:02:20.160 --> 2:02:27.120]  but the powers that be here are determined to squash everything in their pathway uh i mean
[2:02:27.120 --> 2:02:34.160]  what do we have going on here we have at its core what is the core of the the the rigging
[2:02:34.160 --> 2:02:39.280]  and the manipulation of the financial markets it's very simple it's world central banks none
[2:02:39.280 --> 2:02:45.760]  was so than the federal reserve who are finishing what they started in 1913 the inception of the
[2:02:45.760 --> 2:02:51.920]  federal reserve which is to be the lender and buyer of last resort they want to own it all they want
[2:02:51.920 --> 2:02:57.520]  to own the world and uh these institutions are criminal cartels no one knows this better than
[2:02:57.520 --> 2:03:02.640]  you do uh and they are involved in a market rigging scheme the likes of which we've never
[2:03:02.640 --> 2:03:07.760]  seen in the history of the world artificially suppressing rates now for over an entire decade
[2:03:07.760 --> 2:03:14.640]  robbing the middle class blind of trillions in realized wealth uh fostering a massive wealth
[2:03:14.640 --> 2:03:21.600]  transfer uh to the upper echelon of society we have now brokerages participating in this the
[2:03:21.600 --> 2:03:26.160]  markets are complete it's a rig game it's an unbelievably rig game no one should know this
[2:03:26.160 --> 2:03:32.640]  better than me because this is all i do uh and my job is to try to let people understand what's
[2:03:32.640 --> 2:03:39.360]  happening and why it's happening this is a global takeover by the central banks while working in
[2:03:39.360 --> 2:03:46.000]  concert okay to uh literally own it all and you know they're propping up the stock market
[2:03:46.000 --> 2:03:52.480]  artificially wall street right now highest bonus is on record uh this this past christmas well
[2:03:52.480 --> 2:03:58.960]  you've got the uh the the public here suffering homelessness exploding you got the full reserves
[2:03:58.960 --> 2:04:03.520]  balance sheet last year that almost doubled no one's paying attention to what's going on here it's
[2:04:03.520 --> 2:04:09.280]  it's insane completely insane but it's a big it's a big scam on the people and what we're seeing
[2:04:09.280 --> 2:04:16.400]  lately with the brokerages is in all part of it and uh let me ask this question are the heads funds
[2:04:16.400 --> 2:04:20.480]  legitimately scared because their body language is they're really scared that if the public ever
[2:04:20.480 --> 2:04:24.560]  figures out their tricks their power is gone but if they try to bring in regulators against the
[2:04:24.560 --> 2:04:28.800]  little guy nobody's gonna buy that so this really seems like a the beginning of the end somehow
[2:04:28.800 --> 2:04:35.600]  or or seems like something big is happening well you're absolutely right on this point the truth
[2:04:36.160 --> 2:04:41.760]  is the only answer here and the fact of the matter is we have and as you talk about all the time we
[2:04:41.760 --> 2:04:45.200]  have politicians here that are on the take they're all bought and paid for the most part they're
[2:04:45.200 --> 2:04:50.000]  bought and paid for they do not have our best interest in mind their best interest is with the
[2:04:50.000 --> 2:04:56.000]  big money uh what are they trying to do what's the grand plan here i've been outlining for an entire
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:05:03.040]  decade that we are going back to a feudal system uh extreme haves extreme have nots middle class is
[2:05:03.040 --> 2:05:08.320]  being erased i've said that people have a target tattooed on their face if you remember of the
[2:05:08.320 --> 2:05:14.720]  middle class they're trying to destroy you uh and they're doing a damn good job now with the
[2:05:14.720 --> 2:05:19.520]  hedge funds here look if you let's just go over that real quick because it's an unbelievable scam
[2:05:19.520 --> 2:05:24.080]  so we understand i mean it's common knowledge would happen with game stop you had hedge funds
[2:05:24.080 --> 2:05:31.280]  uh shorting the stock to the highest possible order um and then what happened well it looked like
[2:05:31.280 --> 2:05:38.320]  there was a short squeeze that went on here initiated initially by by retail traders and
[2:05:38.320 --> 2:05:43.840]  it was working and then all of a sudden you got the brokerages here who got in here and said oh no
[2:05:43.840 --> 2:05:50.000]  no no no we can't allow that to happen and it wasn't just robin hood i mean my own personal broker
[2:05:50.000 --> 2:05:54.800]  i used to go through TD Ameritrade was was involved as well i dumped them i fired my own broker
[2:05:54.800 --> 2:06:01.840]  i said fine i'll find somebody else here but you know the game is now rigged so severely
[2:06:02.480 --> 2:06:09.040]  against the uh the average guy and the average girl it's it's it's a very difficult battle for us
[2:06:09.040 --> 2:06:15.760]  to win but again i think we can win if we have enough of us you see look guys like you guys like me
[2:06:15.760 --> 2:06:21.920]  joe salante a lot of other people out here are trying to raise the the awareness of the people
[2:06:21.920 --> 2:06:27.840]  as to what's actually happening and what they're trying to do via the mainstream media and every
[2:06:27.840 --> 2:06:34.640]  other avenue they possibly can is try to convince people that what they're seeing is not well exactly
[2:06:34.640 --> 2:06:40.320]  look at how big tech came in to try to defend and censor tens of millions of positive comments
[2:06:40.320 --> 2:06:46.560]  for the the the redditors i mean this is massive coordinated oppression racketeering on a scale
[2:06:46.560 --> 2:06:51.600]  never before seen whole classes of people's silence and targeted for corrupt greedy hedge funds i mean
[2:06:51.600 --> 2:06:57.600]  this is sickening it's beyond sickening it's it's the hedge funds it's the investment banks at the
[2:06:57.600 --> 2:07:03.440]  core of the whole damn shit show i'm sorry i use that language is is the central banks the central
[2:07:03.440 --> 2:07:12.160]  banks today are the government they are running the world via the financial system and the financial
[2:07:12.160 --> 2:07:18.320]  system is toxic beyond the point of you know belief at this particular point i mean we're in
[2:07:18.320 --> 2:07:24.160]  the midst of a massive wealth transfer like i said earlier the middle class is being wiped out by
[2:07:24.160 --> 2:07:30.160]  design everything is by design alex let me put another perspective on this we understand understand
[2:07:30.160 --> 2:07:36.640]  what's going on with what i call the scandemic here okay the central banks who's benefiting from
[2:07:37.120 --> 2:07:41.440]  what we're seeing here with regard to the coronavirus scandemic or whatever you want to
[2:07:41.440 --> 2:07:47.280]  put it it's the central banks and big pharma okay what they did is successfully shut down the global
[2:07:47.280 --> 2:07:52.560]  economy the central banks successfully shut down the global economy why would they want to do
[2:07:52.560 --> 2:07:58.560]  something like that so they can kill what's known as the money velocity or the rate at which cash
[2:07:58.560 --> 2:08:06.000]  at which cash moves through our economy by doing this they can go wild and vastly inflate their
[2:08:06.000 --> 2:08:11.120]  balance sheets again last year the federal reserve's balance sheet nearly doubled uh went from 4.4
[2:08:11.120 --> 2:08:16.000]  trillion to quantify that they have an inflation problem creating all these derivatives and all
[2:08:16.000 --> 2:08:20.160]  this extra money for them that they get first use of that would show the hyperinflation but
[2:08:20.160 --> 2:08:25.440]  if they stagnate and create a depression for us it then hides that wealth secures it only to them
[2:08:25.440 --> 2:08:30.640]  which they can then use to buy up our real assets that's exactly what they're doing by killing the
[2:08:30.640 --> 2:08:36.240]  economy by shutting off the rate at which cash moves to the economy it allows them to inflate
[2:08:36.240 --> 2:08:44.080]  vastly without the risk of massive and hyperinflation to get hyperinflation you need cash moving
[2:08:44.080 --> 2:08:49.920]  through the economy of the world economy so they kill the global economy so the central banks
[2:08:49.920 --> 2:08:56.560]  can inflate the central bank the federal reserve is funneling dollars around the world to central
[2:08:56.560 --> 2:09:02.160]  banks around the world effectively dollarizing the world and these central banks are buying assets
[2:09:02.160 --> 2:09:08.160]  just like you said with dollars not even their own currency so they're dollarizing the world
[2:09:08.160 --> 2:09:13.680]  because they can they killed the money velocity there's no chance right now of a massive hyper
[2:09:13.680 --> 2:09:18.480]  inflationary event occurring brazilian arena you're on fire stay there come back and talk

[2:12:07.920 --> 2:12:13.120]  in the fourth hour as well i'll tell you about and listen i'm not complaining up there i'm not
[2:12:13.120 --> 2:12:20.080]  bitching our audience was let's not exaggerate at the peak it ever was in 2016 for the election
[2:12:20.080 --> 2:12:26.000]  and we had clicking different ip addresses on our audio and video feeds on our own platforms
[2:12:26.880 --> 2:12:30.800]  80 something million people in one week and the system knew that was the biggest show in
[2:12:30.800 --> 2:12:34.720]  the world at that point and before that you know we probably had a three or four million
[2:12:34.720 --> 2:12:38.800]  listeners today that's great i love it i mean i just want a bullhorn to fight tearing i don't
[2:12:38.800 --> 2:12:43.360]  want to retire next week if we just defeat this thing or back it off but now under the
[2:12:43.360 --> 2:12:47.840]  deplatforming we were as low as a million viewers or listeners a day a couple years ago but it built
[2:12:47.840 --> 2:12:52.560]  back up out of the censorship it built back up is what we said came true where we've been having
[2:12:52.560 --> 2:12:56.960]  five million views a day or more on on band off video three or four million people dialing into
[2:12:56.960 --> 2:13:02.800]  our own streams not to mention hundreds of radio stations all of it but the frustration is there's
[2:13:02.800 --> 2:13:07.600]  not more money coming in i don't have george soros there folks cutting me giant checks you read
[2:13:07.600 --> 2:13:13.840]  about soros given some of these democrat websites 500 million dollars a year i mean just my bandwidth
[2:13:13.840 --> 2:13:18.880]  and tech costs are 20 million a year sounds like a huge number no money's inflated and so i got to
[2:13:18.880 --> 2:13:24.640]  sell a lot of trader joe's t-shirts to keep this place on the air and so we kind of got a little
[2:13:24.640 --> 2:13:28.880]  bit in the black in the last few months we were almost in the red six months ago but if i don't
[2:13:28.880 --> 2:13:33.600]  hustle i'll be back in the red again they want to take us off the air so everybody get a traders

[2:13:59.280 --> 2:14:05.280]  popular trader and talk show host and the robin hood of wall street obviously a very well spoken
[2:14:05.280 --> 2:14:10.640]  guy everything he said in the last segment is dead on true so you were talking about a global war
[2:14:10.640 --> 2:14:15.520]  to consolidate power by big banks the the hedge funds are just their hyenas that bring us down
[2:14:15.520 --> 2:14:20.640]  an attack is like the economic hitman john perkins exposed a decade ago you're absolutely right
[2:14:20.640 --> 2:14:25.760]  so so what's the next shoe to drop how's their takeover going how do we fight back so many points
[2:14:26.800 --> 2:14:32.080]  well i'll tell you real quick i mean we have to look look i practiced medicine for 20 years before
[2:14:32.080 --> 2:14:37.920]  i went off to do this and when you look at any kind of a complicated problem you have to go to
[2:14:37.920 --> 2:14:45.200]  its root cause what is the driving force again well obviously it's it's the banks it's the banks
[2:14:45.200 --> 2:14:52.000]  that are running the entire show the entire world and the hub the hub of this entire thing the hub
[2:14:52.000 --> 2:14:59.440]  of the new world order is the federal reserve the federal reserve is no more federal than federal
[2:14:59.440 --> 2:15:04.640]  express they control our motives transaction they're funneling dollars to everyone they want to buy
[2:15:04.640 --> 2:15:14.160]  off the banks look you got goldman sacks gp morgan morgan stanley city group these run the fed it's
[2:15:14.160 --> 2:15:21.200]  no secret it's private banks private institutions we need to direct our attention at the root
[2:15:21.200 --> 2:15:26.480]  cause of the problem the root cause of everything we're seeing here the puppet government that's
[2:15:26.480 --> 2:15:30.080]  been a puppet government for quite a long time they're all bought and paid for i don't care what
[2:15:30.080 --> 2:15:34.640]  they're the ones that went to claus swabb they admit the i am at the world bank of their fronts
[2:15:34.640 --> 2:15:38.320]  for the bank of europe the bank of england the bank of the us here which is really private as you
[2:15:38.320 --> 2:15:42.240]  said it's on record just federal's federal ammunition or federal express or federal
[2:15:42.240 --> 2:15:47.200]  trash compactors they come in and they set the precedent to say what's essential what is an
[2:15:47.200 --> 2:15:51.920]  essential and they call it the great reset they said making us poor is good for the earth
[2:15:51.920 --> 2:15:56.800]  it's an incredible situation that's exactly what they're doing people are buying into it i cannot
[2:15:56.800 --> 2:16:01.360]  believe what i'm seeing i mean that's why you know i get i don't know how much you watch my show
[2:16:01.360 --> 2:16:05.760]  but i get kind of riled up like you do once in a while when you have a lot of man go crazy
[2:16:06.640 --> 2:16:10.960]  yeah you go crazy you know you just sometimes this stuff gets to you but the truth is
[2:16:11.920 --> 2:16:16.800]  we i am so happy that there are people like you and myself and other guys you're so like they're
[2:16:16.800 --> 2:16:21.760]  trying to get out the truth here trying to let people understand what they're actually seeing
[2:16:21.760 --> 2:16:26.400]  is real you got the mainstream media all of it every single bit of it they're bought and paid for
[2:16:26.400 --> 2:16:31.200]  their puppets they're told what to say when to say it people like you and me we say what we want to
[2:16:31.200 --> 2:16:35.440]  say because you know we understand and the people that at least follow our work know the truth when
[2:16:35.440 --> 2:16:40.160]  they hear what would happen to the public ever got this isn't game stop at amc the start of people
[2:16:40.160 --> 2:16:44.800]  getting the power they have period you know something i am really happy you brought that up
[2:16:44.800 --> 2:16:50.800]  because i am hoping that yes that people are going to start to see how absolutely rigged this is
[2:16:50.800 --> 2:16:56.080]  look i'm out here every day twice a day during the week trying to talk about you know how this
[2:16:56.080 --> 2:17:01.600]  market is rigged but i'm also telling people this opportunity okay where there is some rigging like
[2:17:01.600 --> 2:17:07.760]  this and fakery and propaganda and look here don't look here this is an environment of opportunity
[2:17:07.760 --> 2:17:12.640]  so what i say to people is okay we know what they're doing the central banks are going to inflate on a
[2:17:12.640 --> 2:17:18.080]  vast scale they have what they have the brokerages you know bought and paid for as well you know
[2:17:18.080 --> 2:17:25.280]  limiting the uh the retail trader uh their their profit used to be here in the united states if you
[2:17:25.280 --> 2:17:30.160]  made a good investment you know it paid off for you but not anymore not anymore no you're only
[2:17:30.160 --> 2:17:34.240]  allowed to sell your assets you're not allowed to buy them or maybe you can be very restricted i mean
[2:17:34.240 --> 2:17:38.400]  let me give you an example we've got a ranch in east texas we know a lot of the ranchers and farms
[2:17:38.400 --> 2:17:41.840]  and the way they have the cattle business and the meatpackers no matter how much you
[2:17:42.400 --> 2:17:46.640]  sell the cow for the way the taxes work you never make money but because there's only three meatpackers
[2:17:46.640 --> 2:17:51.040]  instead of a hundred in the u.s. they all make the money so a steak that costs 50 bucks at a
[2:17:51.040 --> 2:17:55.840]  steakhouse you might get a dollar you know for that so so so there's nothing there so then
[2:17:56.400 --> 2:18:00.480]  my dad's got a few oil wells and gas wells well in the old days we had neighbors that had them
[2:18:00.480 --> 2:18:04.720]  they made a lot of money the way it all works now the way they run the taxes and the regulations
[2:18:04.720 --> 2:18:09.200]  you basically end up making no money so like even if you quote have gas wells on your own property
[2:18:09.200 --> 2:18:12.880]  you get almost no money because you're not a multinational corporation they have gained
[2:18:12.880 --> 2:18:19.760]  every angle of it absolutely not only have they gained every angle of it they know every angle
[2:18:19.760 --> 2:18:23.440]  of it and that's the whole they anticipate things and when they see something going on here like
[2:18:23.440 --> 2:18:29.360]  let's say the public wants to make us stand against gme or a particular asset slv silver
[2:18:29.360 --> 2:18:34.400]  whatever it might be they're already they're ready for it and it's a shame here because
[2:18:34.400 --> 2:18:40.720]  what people need to understand never ever ever in the history of the world have we witnessed what
[2:18:40.720 --> 2:18:46.080]  we're seeing now we have a stock market near all-time record highs in an economy in freefall
[2:18:46.080 --> 2:18:55.120]  by design nothing nothing that we are seeing here is by accident every single thing is all
[2:18:55.120 --> 2:19:01.120]  been thought out in advance and then released that's what they do there are think tanks that
[2:19:01.120 --> 2:19:05.040]  say okay what are we gonna do how are we gonna manipulate the public how are we gonna rig the
[2:19:05.040 --> 2:19:08.640]  financial you're not just saying that we'll come back and talk about they have literally
[2:19:08.640 --> 2:19:14.160]  thousands of think tanks dozens of top ones that get billions like ran corporation you
[2:19:14.160 --> 2:19:18.640]  name it and they look at every conceivable scenario and mix scenario for what they're
[2:19:18.640 --> 2:19:21.520]  going to do and then they pull a file off the shelf when it happens and implement
[2:19:22.800 --> 2:19:27.440]  exactly then they implemented they get and what do they do they get the mainstream media outlets
[2:19:27.440 --> 2:19:33.200]  to push an agenda then what their main tactic okay and you know this i think better than anybody
[2:19:33.200 --> 2:19:40.960]  on the planet is to control people by fear make people afraid of one thing just one like a virus
[2:19:40.960 --> 2:19:47.280]  for example and you control their minds it's an epic thing they want people paralyzed and the more
[2:19:47.280 --> 2:19:54.800]  fear that the mainstream channels whatever can can put out the more fearful fear they create
[2:19:54.800 --> 2:20:01.520]  the more paralyzed people become they do not want people to number one know the truth number two
[2:20:01.520 --> 2:20:08.320]  god forbid act on that truth because then they win they must divide and so you're a smart guy
[2:20:08.320 --> 2:20:12.080]  and i'm serious obviously you know what you're talking about let's talk about the solutions
[2:20:12.080 --> 2:20:15.920]  where you think this is going what's going to happen with silver game stop other big things

[2:24:46.640 --> 2:24:51.200]  the losers and now they're telling you you're non-essential so our guest gregory menorino
[2:24:51.200 --> 2:24:57.360]  who is a successful trader and author and of course known as the robin hood of wall street
[2:24:57.360 --> 2:25:02.480]  you were getting into all this how do we fight back what do you expect them to do next because
[2:25:02.480 --> 2:25:08.640]  this is a brutal war more people produced uh from from middle class to poverty in the last year
[2:25:08.640 --> 2:25:12.560]  than any time in human history millions and millions extra starving to death that you and
[2:25:12.560 --> 2:25:17.200]  admits while the un runs the program for the lockdown covid's not killing them the lockdown is
[2:25:17.200 --> 2:25:23.920]  i mean this is just a new kind of war isn't it absolutely it is again and they're implementing
[2:25:23.920 --> 2:25:29.120]  their fun i call it their final solution and i've been using that exact term i mean it's a pretty
[2:25:29.120 --> 2:25:35.760]  grim phrase i think you know what this is from here but you know look this is their end game
[2:25:35.760 --> 2:25:41.840]  their end game and i'm talking about those who are running the world the core of this
[2:25:41.840 --> 2:25:50.400]  entire thing is the central banks governments government leaders kings queens monopsul presidents
[2:25:50.400 --> 2:25:56.960]  they do not run a damn thing they all have their strings pulled by the central banks we have witnessed
[2:25:56.960 --> 2:26:04.080]  a hideous merger between corporations and a new american system a new american american government
[2:26:04.080 --> 2:26:10.000]  i've been warning about this for the longest time and it's now in our face um and again just like
[2:26:10.000 --> 2:26:16.000]  you alluded to you've got corporations stronger and bigger and more powerful than they have ever
[2:26:16.000 --> 2:26:23.200]  been meanwhile they they not the virus they shut down not just the us economy but the global
[2:26:23.200 --> 2:26:30.480]  economy so they could finish what they started to inflict we need to raise the awareness of people
[2:26:30.480 --> 2:26:38.240]  that it's the banks it's the central banks are running the entire show everything else is theater
[2:26:38.240 --> 2:26:44.720]  from our congressional leaders and their president all of it is a show to get people to look to
[2:26:44.720 --> 2:26:51.600]  something it's the banks that are running it all all of it they pull the strings period the end
[2:26:51.600 --> 2:26:57.920]  i've discussed this to the point of nauseam on my show and again the proof is in our face look
[2:26:57.920 --> 2:27:02.320]  what they've done they've killed the economy so they can inflate they've killed the economy so
[2:27:02.320 --> 2:27:09.040]  they can buy it all the fed is buying it all right now everything uh and there again there are
[2:27:09.040 --> 2:27:13.920]  there are hundreds of central banks around the world it's like a disgusting hands that are crushing
[2:27:13.920 --> 2:27:20.560]  us squashing out our liberties and our freedoms but what can we do about it awareness is number one
[2:27:20.560 --> 2:27:28.240]  number two number two use this to your advantage for every action there is a reaction there's a
[2:27:28.240 --> 2:27:35.040]  cause and there is an effect you do not want to be an effect you want to be a cause meaning you
[2:27:35.040 --> 2:27:39.280]  want to take action what action should you be taking i'll tell you from a financial standpoint
[2:27:39.280 --> 2:27:46.000]  what you need to do it's it's could not be more simple if we understand that the central banks
[2:27:46.000 --> 2:27:52.480]  are running the show and their goal is to vastly inflate and we're going to quickly at one point
[2:27:52.480 --> 2:27:57.280]  move into a currency crisis a debt crisis unlike anything we've ever seen we'll talk about that
[2:27:57.280 --> 2:28:01.520]  because there's a lot of a lot of ideas a lot of well-known things but but give us your perspective
[2:28:01.520 --> 2:28:07.760]  on that i mean first off is it internet mobs uh countering what they do like game stop amc and
[2:28:07.760 --> 2:28:11.520]  now what's happening with silver because obviously they can push silver down for a while but once
[2:28:11.520 --> 2:28:16.720]  people figure out that it's 50 to 100 to one digital versus physical and demanding physical
[2:28:16.720 --> 2:28:20.960]  the men's admit they can't keep it up with that expose them or do people get into real estate
[2:28:20.960 --> 2:28:24.640]  knowing it's going to be hyperinflated or they get into debt or they get out of debt i mean
[2:28:24.640 --> 2:28:30.240]  what's your view well i think people again need to understand what's going on we have the largest
[2:28:30.240 --> 2:28:35.360]  bank on the planet by assets uh i'm going to call them out right here and i've been calling them out
[2:28:35.360 --> 2:28:42.720]  for the longest time this is jp morgan jp morgan the wall street super bank they are essentially
[2:28:42.720 --> 2:28:51.840]  the core rigors of the metals markets they dump at at points you will see uh paper silver paper
[2:28:51.840 --> 2:28:58.240]  gold dumped onto the market more than his mind and an entire year look the commodities exchange
[2:28:58.240 --> 2:29:03.200]  is well aware of this i know people that work there everyone knows who's doing it but no one
[2:29:03.200 --> 2:29:07.360]  wants to do anything about it they say okay well what can we do about it you know what i think you
[2:29:07.360 --> 2:29:12.320]  should do be doing about it good you let them play their game let them suppress the price of precious
[2:29:12.320 --> 2:29:16.560]  metals we know that it should be exponentially higher than it is going back to what i was saying
[2:29:16.560 --> 2:29:22.800]  earlier this is how we beat the system okay you don't go with the crowd you bet against the system
[2:29:22.800 --> 2:29:27.680]  you become your own central bank uh and how do you do that you you let them play their game
[2:29:27.680 --> 2:29:31.440]  with regard to metal they want to suppress the price of gold they want to suppress the price
[2:29:31.440 --> 2:29:36.480]  of silver cryptocurrencies whatever it might be good let them play their game what we're going to do
[2:29:36.480 --> 2:29:40.480]  is we're going to take the opposite side of that trade and we're going to acquire it just like they
[2:29:40.480 --> 2:29:46.080]  are the richest people in the world today what are they doing are they in are they in dollars
[2:29:46.080 --> 2:29:51.200]  people will have a few dollars laying around no they're in hard assets the market runs in cycles
[2:29:51.200 --> 2:29:57.440]  alex you get risk on you get risk off when you have a risk on environment like we have today
[2:29:57.440 --> 2:30:01.920]  you see stock market stocks going up up up up up up up up up and other assets for example
[2:30:01.920 --> 2:30:07.920]  gold silver platinum pletium and yes cryptocurrencies in my view are suppressed i don't care that
[2:30:07.920 --> 2:30:11.920]  bitcoin is not thirty six thousand dollars i told people to stop buying this stuff at nearly three
[2:30:11.920 --> 2:30:16.400]  thousand dollars it's it went to forty two thousand dollars and i told people hey you know
[2:30:16.400 --> 2:30:21.840]  think about pulling profit went down to twenty seven thousand now it's at thirty seven thousand
[2:30:21.840 --> 2:30:29.280]  is going much higher we need to understand what actions that we can take to protect ourselves
[2:30:29.280 --> 2:30:34.320]  to protect the people we love our communities and understand it's a freak show understand
[2:30:34.320 --> 2:30:38.720]  what's really going on that's right if you're aware of the freak show you can cut them off beat
[2:30:38.720 --> 2:30:42.960]  them at their own game if you have a big group of people or if you're watching closely i'm not
[2:30:42.960 --> 2:30:46.400]  gotten into it because it would be consuming to try to study every aspect of the fraud we know
[2:30:46.400 --> 2:30:50.400]  it's a fraud well it's one of some of the things you would just not giving financial advice but
[2:30:50.400 --> 2:30:57.600]  personally you're doing well i i attack this from every possible angle every possible angle and
[2:30:57.600 --> 2:31:01.600]  all everyone that follows my work i call them my lions who trade with me they know exactly what
[2:31:01.600 --> 2:31:07.040]  i'm doing i'll just tell you i've been buying physical gold physical silver i also own platinum
[2:31:07.040 --> 2:31:10.560]  pletium i've been doing this for years and years and years i've been buying silver since you're
[2:31:10.560 --> 2:31:16.160]  like i don't know maybe it's maybe eight bucks maybe lower than that uh gold was maybe i don't
[2:31:16.160 --> 2:31:20.400]  know seven or eight hundred bucks at that particular time and i don't care what they want to do to it
[2:31:20.400 --> 2:31:25.040]  it should be exponentially higher based on exploding debt i mean that's the key here what are
[2:31:25.040 --> 2:31:29.360]  they talking about what is biden talking about what is everyone talking about here borrowing
[2:31:29.360 --> 2:31:34.640]  more money into existence the system is toxic we have to explain what what they do is they have
[2:31:34.640 --> 2:31:40.880]  100 200 300 500 times digital gold and digital silver that they can then sell on the market
[2:31:40.880 --> 2:31:47.600]  to drive it down but they never get called because no one's demanding physical delivery right exactly
[2:31:47.600 --> 2:31:53.200]  well you know it's very difficult for people to let's say if you're buying a paper derivative of
[2:31:53.200 --> 2:32:00.400]  gold and or silver to actually get the hard assets how do you do it well how do me personally i go
[2:32:00.400 --> 2:32:04.800]  through uh i happen to like atmex american precious metals exchange i've been buying from these people
[2:32:04.800 --> 2:32:12.960]  for years never one time have i had a problem with these people not once uh in uh yin over a decade
[2:32:12.960 --> 2:32:18.560]  longer than that maybe 15 years since i started buying all this stuff here so you get the physical
[2:32:18.560 --> 2:32:23.520]  thing and that way it sends a chain reaction oh yeah buy the physical bleed them dry if they
[2:32:23.520 --> 2:32:28.000]  want to play their games look what happened we had as a matter of fact i got it right here they say
[2:32:28.000 --> 2:32:34.640]  that the us mint cannot keep up with it and it's exponential now absolutely i've been telling people
[2:32:34.640 --> 2:32:40.080]  that free there's going to be a moment when there's nothing left here and that's when this whole thing
[2:32:40.080 --> 2:32:45.600]  is going to is going to break but again what we need to focus on here again a lot of people talking
[2:32:45.600 --> 2:32:49.680]  about a big market crash a meltdown yes sure that is going to happen because that's part of the end
[2:32:49.680 --> 2:32:54.880]  game but when people sit there and they're staring at the dow Jones industrial average they must
[2:32:54.880 --> 2:32:59.600]  realize they're looking in the wrong spot you've got to follow the debt market the debt market or
[2:32:59.600 --> 2:33:05.200]  specifically the 10 year yield the 10 year yield or the debt market you know as in aggregate is the
[2:33:05.200 --> 2:33:10.080]  largest part of this market people like oh get the dow Jones industrial average it's the debt
[2:33:10.080 --> 2:33:14.240]  that's got the quadrillions that's where the pie and just the insanity is let's come back and talk
[2:33:14.240 --> 2:33:18.400]  about that with our guest again on alex jones we just tuned in this local radio station this is a

[2:35:22.560 --> 2:35:27.920]  who he works for he works directly for prince charles he developed since the 80s the plan for
[2:35:27.920 --> 2:35:33.840]  global sustainability that means worldwide neo feudalism in his own works so you might want

[2:36:05.040 --> 2:36:11.360]  and exposing the anti-human globalist death agenda that's why when we go out and shoot videos
[2:36:11.360 --> 2:36:17.840]  they're at band on video they're not allowed to be on twitter on youtube on facebook that's why
[2:36:17.840 --> 2:36:23.680]  it's so precious because the censorship expands to everyone which it is now with ai monitoring

[2:37:53.600 --> 2:38:03.600]  so
[2:38:14.640 --> 2:38:19.360]  Gregory Manorino is our guest for one more segment and John Rappaport investigative journalist
[2:38:19.360 --> 2:38:25.600]  always very informative text over and everything he's saying is totally true i mean i cut my teeth
[2:38:25.600 --> 2:38:31.920]  on Barry Goldwater and Ronald Reagan and Ron Paul and all this stuff is on record true i've checked
[2:38:31.920 --> 2:38:39.440]  the federal reserve charter all of it never been audited we're now 108 years into this monster
[2:38:40.720 --> 2:38:47.200]  and it is a total dictatorship they get to play god and so we're talking about
[2:38:47.200 --> 2:38:51.200]  where this is going well of course they're abusing their power not they have a technocracy to track
[2:38:51.200 --> 2:38:55.520]  everything we do the big central banks are saying you're obsolete they're saying you are
[2:38:55.520 --> 2:39:01.600]  non-essential that's not just a twilight zone episode where he says you are obsolete mr wordsworth
[2:39:01.600 --> 2:39:06.560]  you are non-essential they're actually doing it and all these leftists think in a communist system
[2:39:06.560 --> 2:39:11.280]  you get all this free time you lay around no you're a slave and then some banker lives offshore
[2:39:11.280 --> 2:39:18.000]  and runs your communist country as a farm that they held a cfr brags that they set up china
[2:39:18.000 --> 2:39:22.080]  as a farm i'm not against the great chinese people i'm against the chinese communist
[2:39:22.080 --> 2:39:27.520]  run by the globalist and so they're getting rid of our free market they're getting rid
[2:39:28.080 --> 2:39:33.200]  of of the little sliver of the piece that we could live off of because it makes us too uppity
[2:39:33.200 --> 2:39:37.440]  and Gregory in the five six minutes we have left i really want to invite you back
[2:39:37.440 --> 2:39:42.560]  yes the end game has collapsed everything once they've made it's not essential once they've
[2:39:42.560 --> 2:39:48.160]  gotten us on a universal income then they collapse things even more to dictate so so give people
[2:39:48.160 --> 2:39:54.480]  where compliance where submission goes and then hey i love game stop i i love amc i love propping
[2:39:54.480 --> 2:39:59.120]  up things the enemy wants to destroy for me it's not an investment for me it's war but but but there
[2:39:59.120 --> 2:40:05.840]  are other ways to skin this cat isn't there absolutely and again just having an awareness
[2:40:05.840 --> 2:40:10.400]  of what's going on what are they doing alex they're trying desperately and they're succeeding in
[2:40:10.400 --> 2:40:17.840]  creating a slave society a dependent slave society again why are they doing what they're doing here
[2:40:17.840 --> 2:40:22.320]  why are they creating this tutu society why are they getting rid of the middle class it's about
[2:40:22.320 --> 2:40:28.480]  control they want to make the government get much larger and much more powerful they want people
[2:40:28.480 --> 2:40:38.080]  dependent on the system literally creating zombies slaves that will bow down to a government big
[2:40:38.080 --> 2:40:45.600]  government a one world government this is where we are going here a new system a new paradigm a new
[2:40:45.600 --> 2:40:54.000]  dollar a new mode of transaction we are in the middle in my view of a massive shift from from
[2:40:54.000 --> 2:41:00.720]  one set of from one system to a completely new system and what did they do in order to finish
[2:41:00.720 --> 2:41:08.240]  the job they had to do one thing alex and that one thing was to shut down the global economy
[2:41:08.240 --> 2:41:13.680]  that's the key doing this whole virus scandemic however you want to look at it i know you cover
[2:41:13.680 --> 2:41:21.120]  it a lot that's the key they they got this out here they got the mainstream media pushing their
[2:41:21.120 --> 2:41:26.800]  agenda they got people afraid they got people who can't act they're making them paralyzed they're
[2:41:26.800 --> 2:41:32.560]  making dependent on the system they're creating slaves alex this is what they're doing guys like
[2:41:32.560 --> 2:41:37.200]  you and me i would hope this doesn't happen but they don't want us to talk you know that better
[2:41:37.200 --> 2:41:41.360]  than anybody else they want to shut us down they they don't want the truth out there because the
[2:41:41.360 --> 2:41:47.040]  truth gives us power and if we know it's only that there are a few hundred people left on air like
[2:41:47.040 --> 2:41:51.280]  tucker carlson you myself others limbaugh's dying of cancer he's not perfect he's a good guy
[2:41:52.640 --> 2:41:56.800]  when they feel like they've got everybody covered they're going to go even crazier they admit that
[2:41:56.800 --> 2:42:02.800]  they want to depopulate the planet i mean this is serious well this is how it's going to get
[2:42:02.800 --> 2:42:07.040]  set up alex i can tell you what are they doing they're using the financial markets right now to
[2:42:07.040 --> 2:42:11.440]  create a massive wealth transfer effect and it's always the same thing we know what they're going
[2:42:11.440 --> 2:42:17.280]  to do because we've seen this game before but never to this degree central banks the flow reserve
[2:42:17.280 --> 2:42:23.680]  has hyperinflated a bubble in debt on a scale in magnitude that even me and i studied this stuff
[2:42:23.680 --> 2:42:29.680]  around the clock 24 7 i can't even get my head around it's so big that debt bubble has inflated
[2:42:29.680 --> 2:42:34.080]  a massive bubble in the stock market and a massive bubble in housing what they're going to do at a
[2:42:34.080 --> 2:42:40.720]  time of their choosing is allowed the debt bubble to burst when the debt bubble bursts alex there's
[2:42:40.720 --> 2:42:46.080]  going to be pandemonium in the streets what are they trying to do why is the federal reserve right
[2:42:46.080 --> 2:42:53.360]  now involved in a money printing digital assets uh extra while funding black lives matter when
[2:42:53.360 --> 2:42:56.720]  there's an economic collapse which is in the imf world bank document they do this on purpose
[2:42:56.720 --> 2:43:01.680]  with herbal countries they'll cause a race war as the cover for what they're doing well of course
[2:43:01.680 --> 2:43:06.800]  they'll do it of course to keep the distraction off of what they are doing here so what's going
[2:43:06.800 --> 2:43:12.560]  to end up happening again by design is they're trying to prevent the financial system right now
[2:43:12.560 --> 2:43:17.760]  from locking up something called a credit freeze when the system just stops there's no cash in the
[2:43:17.760 --> 2:43:22.160]  bank nothing can be had this is why the fed is doing what they're doing they're buying it all by
[2:43:22.160 --> 2:43:30.800]  design in order to allow a monumental event to occur wait for the public reaction and then they're
[2:43:30.800 --> 2:43:36.640]  going to offer their solution it's always a three step three step process so again talking about
[2:43:36.640 --> 2:43:42.080]  depopulation absolutely they're going to let the people kill each other this is why i've been telling
[2:43:42.080 --> 2:43:49.040]  people get together with like minded people pay attention to shows like yours shows like mine
[2:43:49.040 --> 2:43:54.480]  get on the understand what's going on raise your awareness i want to invite you back next week for

[2:44:13.120 --> 2:44:17.920]  like an old barn in a in a tornado i mean my gut is just buddy you better get close to the ground
[2:44:17.920 --> 2:44:27.040]  right now 100 look this is this is all by design nothing we're seeing is by accident people and
[2:44:27.040 --> 2:44:33.280]  understand they they want you gone they don't they they want control it's all about control it's about
[2:44:33.280 --> 2:44:38.400]  creating a new society a completely new set of rules and it's getting written right before our
[2:44:38.400 --> 2:44:43.280]  face they got us locked up in our houses why they don't want us together don't want us conversing
[2:44:43.280 --> 2:44:47.680]  they don't want the truth getting out there they want people afraid paralyzed not to act this
[2:44:48.320 --> 2:44:54.640]  what they're doing all of this is a scyop on a scale that is again unbelievable because a foreign
[2:44:54.640 --> 2:44:59.600]  army we would rally and fight but if it's economic and it's cultural what do we do all right i'm

[2:47:42.960 --> 2:47:48.400]  networks and we did it because we do this was coming thank god god inspired us to make the right
[2:47:48.400 --> 2:47:52.720]  decisions but they're gonna shut everything down when they make their move i mean you think
[2:47:52.720 --> 2:47:57.440]  trump was bad he was just the beta test they're shutting everything down but they're operatives
[2:47:57.440 --> 2:48:02.320]  only the left will be allowed to operate only communist only fascist only authoritarians only
[2:48:02.320 --> 2:48:08.320]  pedophiles only devil worshipers but we're so great thanks to god and our great stations we have
[2:48:08.320 --> 2:48:12.800]  hundreds of radio stations hundreds of cable and tv stations that all have their own streams and stuff

[2:48:23.680 --> 2:48:30.720]  us to be and we're building more stuff so you can burn in hell new world order john rapaport straight
[2:48:30.720 --> 2:48:38.080]  ahead we have the technocrats are controlling the food supply secure your own safe source of
[2:48:38.080 --> 2:48:42.560]  food supply sale it's the new prices in 2021 but it's the lowest price for high quality food
[2:48:42.560 --> 2:48:47.600]  you're gonna find at infowarstore.com the subsection is prepared with alex.com and as all
[2:48:47.600 --> 2:48:52.160]  these globalists do this and as they hoard the food and as they prepare you need to understand
[2:48:52.160 --> 2:48:57.360]  that you need 25 year food supply in the last 25 years one month three months six months one year
[2:48:57.360 --> 2:49:01.920]  supplies and it's the highest quality you're gonna find and it's just good to have that checkbox
[2:49:01.920 --> 2:49:06.160]  taken care of and you know you're getting good food at a very good price and you know that a small
[2:49:06.160 --> 2:49:10.480]  percentage of it because there's not much profit in this goes to us to fund our operation so
[2:49:10.480 --> 2:49:15.840]  prepare with alex.com or infowarstore.com you can find prepare in the subsection there water
[2:49:15.840 --> 2:49:19.680]  filtration air filtration it's all there the technocrats are getting ready to bring in all
[2:49:19.680 --> 2:49:24.240]  the force gmo and more it's time to start getting prepared it starts with self defense it starts with
[2:49:24.240 --> 2:49:28.480]  being prepared it starts with horrible food it starts with digging in with a long globalist fight
[2:49:28.480 --> 2:49:29.280]  you'll win in the end
[2:49:33.840 --> 2:49:40.240]  you must guard your humanity you must guard your children's humanity you must guard the very genetic
[2:49:40.240 --> 2:49:44.800]  code of the planet the globalists have set themselves up as the guardians of this world
[2:49:45.840 --> 2:49:49.120]  but they are the ones that are overriding every genetic system and poisoning the planet
[2:49:49.120 --> 2:49:54.720]  they are the ones that are now engaged in genetic takeover of every human
[2:49:54.720 --> 2:49:59.360]  on earth to the GMO crops and now they've moved on to their main target
[2:50:00.080 --> 2:50:05.920]  to mad at me with the mRNA vaccines which are not vaccines they are recombinant DNA
[2:50:06.960 --> 2:50:14.480]  from aborted cloned fetuses who are then inserted into your genome to take over your body's
[2:50:14.480 --> 2:50:21.920]  systems go read the actual inserts for the mRNA vaccines and then remember you've been warned
[2:50:22.720 --> 2:50:26.800]  this is the equivalent of an alien takeover whether it's interdimensional whether it's
[2:50:26.800 --> 2:50:31.280]  little green men the globalists are acting like another species that's overtaking us and overriding
[2:50:31.280 --> 2:50:32.880]  us it's all the same in the end
[2:50:32.880 --> 2:50:42.400]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:50:51.200 --> 2:50:55.200]  if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[2:50:55.200 --> 2:51:02.560]  you're listening to the alex jones show and now your host john rapaport
[2:51:05.280 --> 2:51:13.760]  john rapaport here this hour in four wars a bunch of stories that we need to cover here
[2:51:13.760 --> 2:51:20.640]  and i want to start with one that i talked about last week gotta keep punching this up
[2:51:20.640 --> 2:51:28.560]  because it's very important and it's one of these stories where everybody can chip in
[2:51:29.600 --> 2:51:36.160]  because it's the amount of coverage and perception that matters and it has to do with
[2:51:36.160 --> 2:51:44.720]  bite it has to do with the condition of bite the physical condition the mental condition
[2:51:44.720 --> 2:51:52.240]  as i mentioned last week at length during the campaign presidential campaign
[2:51:53.680 --> 2:52:01.120]  the media were completely silent about the obvious fact that this candidate was in severe
[2:52:01.840 --> 2:52:08.880]  mental decline it wasn't a matter of opinion or well you're looking at it from the skewed angle
[2:52:08.880 --> 2:52:16.240]  or no it was clear and there are many examples and you can find them on video to prove this
[2:52:18.160 --> 2:52:26.400]  it's not just stuttering it's not just stammering it's loss of memory where are we it's the tremors
[2:52:26.400 --> 2:52:34.640]  it's the hyper vigilance toward teleprompter it's what he's saying when he goes off script
[2:52:34.640 --> 2:52:43.840]  it's his mannerisms and so on and so forth and the medical history which has been documented
[2:52:45.040 --> 2:52:53.200]  that in 1988 he had a brain aneurysm which required surgery very serious
[2:52:55.040 --> 2:53:01.200]  two surgeries in fact and then pulmonary thrombosis which was even more serious
[2:53:01.200 --> 2:53:08.800]  life-threatening and since then there has been the mental decline
[2:53:11.680 --> 2:53:18.880]  so we have a disabled person sitting in the oval office as president of the united states
[2:53:19.600 --> 2:53:27.040]  not just a little bit off but severely disabled and obviously the press was under
[2:53:27.040 --> 2:53:34.160]  their tight control tight restriction during the campaign and still not to mention this not to bring
[2:53:34.160 --> 2:53:44.080]  it up not to report on it not to point it out you can find videos from his early career
[2:53:45.280 --> 2:53:50.880]  because he's been in the senate forever when he used to be on the talk shows Sunday morning talk
[2:53:50.880 --> 2:53:57.520]  shows and he was slick Joe very quick very fast whether you agreed with any of his opinions or
[2:53:57.520 --> 2:54:04.400]  not decide the point question answer at length and detail bang bang bang boom boom and now
[2:54:04.960 --> 2:54:09.680]  if you're watching you see the picture on the screen it's a completely different person
[2:54:11.920 --> 2:54:18.160]  you can put these side-by-side videos out there you can also mention the fact that
[2:54:18.160 --> 2:54:28.160]  after trump became president perhaps a year into his term all of a sudden you saw psychiatrists
[2:54:28.160 --> 2:54:36.880]  remember doing remote diagnoses on trump at a distance saying that he was mentally ill suffering
[2:54:36.880 --> 2:54:44.800]  from mental disorders i mean violating all of the ethics and whatever rules actually exist in that
[2:54:44.800 --> 2:54:53.120]  uh completely fake profession of psychiatry and just making diagnoses over and over again
[2:54:53.760 --> 2:55:01.040]  but did you see any astute doctor coming forward during the presidential campaign
[2:55:01.040 --> 2:55:09.200]  saying anything about biden who had access to major media talk shows or news reports absolutely not
[2:55:09.200 --> 2:55:18.400]  this is very serious business do i have to repeat the fact that this is the guy who looks at the
[2:55:18.400 --> 2:55:24.640]  nuclear football and decides whether to launch missiles or not that this guy is being controlled
[2:55:24.640 --> 2:55:32.320]  by a committee and he's a puppet as we come up to the break here keep in mind you can do something
[2:55:32.320 --> 2:55:38.960]  you can do something about this you can make this point and drive it home stay with us
[2:55:42.240 --> 2:55:47.440]  president trump won in a landslide on November 3rd but the globalists weren't going to let that
[2:55:47.440 --> 2:55:53.600]  happen they had to have some way to repudiate the populist movement emanating from the united
[2:55:53.600 --> 2:55:59.920]  states that spread across the world from the uk to brazil they were desperate they admitted
[2:55:59.920 --> 2:56:05.200]  their own publications they didn't know what to do and so they put out 80 million fake ballots
[2:56:05.200 --> 2:56:11.280]  violated state law and stole it better than dollars and now they're coming after the president
[2:56:11.280 --> 2:56:15.520]  they're coming after you they're coming after me they're shutting everybody off the internet
[2:56:15.520 --> 2:56:20.160]  they're trying to totally censor us and that's why info wars is still in the fight because we knew
[2:56:20.160 --> 2:56:25.120]  this was coming we told you this was coming we were the first main target that we're still on air
[2:56:25.120 --> 2:56:30.480]  at info wars.com and do is wars.com and band up with you without your word of mouth without your
[2:56:30.480 --> 2:56:34.880]  prayer without your financial support we can't stay on air so while you still can go to info
[2:56:34.880 --> 2:56:39.520]  war store.com and get storeable foods and high quality products supplements you name it at info
[2:56:39.520 --> 2:56:56.000]  war store.com try to map the board back here the next segment so i'll just wind up what i was
[2:56:56.000 --> 2:57:03.840]  saying before the break you can do something about this if we were to suddenly see on various
[2:57:03.840 --> 2:57:14.640]  platforms 100 000 postings of side by side before and after the brain aneurysm of biden
[2:57:15.520 --> 2:57:25.600]  and the various videos of his obviously disabled state now uncompromisingly pointing to the fact
[2:57:25.600 --> 2:57:34.640]  that this is a man who has such severe mental and motor deficits that there is no way medically
[2:57:34.640 --> 2:57:41.040]  speaking that he should be in the white house it doesn't matter which side you're on it's just a fact
[2:57:42.800 --> 2:57:51.360]  okay so now i want to get to another story here on the covid death numbers i reported on this before
[2:57:51.360 --> 2:58:04.480]  but i found a new source for statistics it's actually statistic.com and this would be recent
[2:58:06.480 --> 2:58:14.560]  this is going official stats here which are certainly not reliable by any means for a variety
[2:58:14.560 --> 2:58:22.080]  of reasons i've explained before on the show but we're going to take that as the uh you know starting
[2:58:22.080 --> 2:58:35.360]  point here so at the point of the statistic report there were 359 352 deaths in the u.s. from covid.
[2:58:35.360 --> 2:58:49.760]  if you were to take the percentage of deaths in people 65 years and older get this it would be 81
[2:58:49.760 --> 2:59:01.520]  percent 81 percent of all covid deaths in the u.s. in 65 years and older and if you don't see
[2:59:01.520 --> 2:59:08.000]  immediately the significance of that i'll explain it a minute if you were to go back and say well
[2:59:08.000 --> 2:59:22.160]  let's look at 55 and older what percentage of deaths covid deaths in the u.s. 93 percent of all
[2:59:22.160 --> 2:59:34.160]  covid deaths in the u.s. 55 years and older that is unbelievable and here's why exactly as i've
[2:59:34.160 --> 2:59:46.320]  explained before first of all overwhelmingly most of these people have prior medical histories of
[2:59:46.320 --> 2:59:55.360]  multiple long-term serious health conditions on top of that they've been treated for years perhaps
[2:59:55.360 --> 3:00:05.360]  decades with toxic medical drugs not just one or two but a variety of toxic medical drugs
[3:00:06.880 --> 3:00:14.400]  number three the people in this older population tend to be terrified by the possibility
[3:00:14.400 --> 3:00:23.520]  that they're going to get a diagnosis of covid 19 and then they do get a diagnosis of covid 19
[3:00:24.560 --> 3:00:33.760]  which rats ratchet up ratchets up their terror and then on top of all of this they are quarantined
[3:00:33.760 --> 3:00:44.000]  isolated and cut off from friends and family whether that's in a nursing home a hospital or at home
[3:00:45.920 --> 3:00:57.280]  wherever they live and one final stroke some of them are then heavily sedated and put on
[3:00:57.280 --> 3:01:05.280]  breathing ventilators and in a large new york study of a hospital chain in new york state
[3:01:06.320 --> 3:01:12.800]  it was determined that for people 65 years and older who were put on ventilators as treatment
[3:01:13.440 --> 3:01:23.040]  97.2 percent of those people died under ventilator treatment that's why i posted my articles in the
[3:01:23.040 --> 3:01:31.600]  past that say soylent green is people covid 19 is old people that's where the deaths are occurring
[3:01:31.600 --> 3:01:39.040]  and notice that in my analysis over the last two three minutes here i've mentioned nothing about a
[3:01:39.040 --> 3:01:47.200]  virus nothing about SARS-CoV-2 no need for a virus no requirement of a virus to explain
[3:01:47.200 --> 3:01:57.920]  any of these deaths in this older population of which 81 percent occur in the group 65 and older
[3:01:57.920 --> 3:02:10.720]  and 93 percent in the population 55 and older talk about killing the forced early premature deaths
[3:02:10.720 --> 3:02:19.440]  of the frail and elderly that's what is going on that is the key operation called covid 19
[3:02:20.480 --> 3:02:22.480]  not anything else
[3:02:22.480 --> 3:02:39.760]  anything else so no virus required to explain these deaths 81 93 percent of all report in the u.s
[3:02:42.720 --> 3:02:46.560]  that's a crime of unimaginable proportions
[3:02:46.560 --> 3:02:55.040]  this mass murder is what it is and it's being completely overlooked of course by the government by
[3:02:55.040 --> 3:03:04.000]  the press by the political left by all those people who want the covid restrictions and the
[3:03:04.000 --> 3:03:11.360]  destruction of the economy because those covid death numbers are part of what's being used to
[3:03:11.360 --> 3:03:19.760]  explain and justify and provoke all of these restricted restrictive covid measures including
[3:03:19.760 --> 3:03:27.120]  masks distancing and most important the lockdowns the closures of businesses the destruction of
[3:03:27.680 --> 3:03:35.440]  workers lives families the economy not just of the u.s but of nations all over the world
[3:03:35.440 --> 3:03:43.600]  but of nations all over the world as the prelude to the great reset which i've also discussed and
[3:03:43.600 --> 3:03:48.080]  described on the show as certainly has alex and other people
[3:03:53.200 --> 3:04:01.520]  so this is the operation the killing of the elderly to leverage into the operation of
[3:04:01.520 --> 3:04:09.520]  the destruction of the economy through covid restrictive measures killing of the elderly
[3:04:11.040 --> 3:04:17.200]  that's what's going on but the nation and the world for the most part
[3:04:18.080 --> 3:04:26.160]  has been hypnotized over the last hundred years by the primarily the rockefeller empire
[3:04:26.160 --> 3:04:34.880]  to say well you're the doctor you know what's best whatever you say doc
[3:04:37.280 --> 3:04:45.680]  and you will find that even people who might disobey doctors orders or not seek out a doctor
[3:04:45.680 --> 3:04:55.200]  retrieval will finally give in because of pressure peer pressure from friends from family from
[3:04:55.200 --> 3:04:59.280]  loved ones you got to see the doctor you got to go to the doctor you got to listen to what the
[3:04:59.280 --> 3:05:05.120]  doctor says so if the doctor says there's a pandemic an epidemic those of you watching
[3:05:05.120 --> 3:05:14.800]  are looking at Fauci who flip-flops every other week that's hypnotic it's what the doctor says
[3:05:14.800 --> 3:05:23.200]  if the doctor says virus virus virus that's what it is i've been warning since 1987 that the
[3:05:23.200 --> 3:05:27.520]  medical cartel is the most powerful cartel in the world long term
[3:05:30.240 --> 3:05:38.240]  because of this century at least of wall-to-wall brainwashing on their part
[3:05:40.000 --> 3:05:46.960]  and now it's all coming to fruition for them because they can now say pandemic pandemic pandemic
[3:05:46.960 --> 3:05:55.360]  and so people overlook the fact that the elderly whom they know who might be in their own families
[3:05:55.920 --> 3:06:02.400]  are actually being forced in exactly the manner that i just described into early death and their
[3:06:02.400 --> 3:06:09.200]  deaths will be counted as COVID deaths and i'm not even talking about those deaths in which
[3:06:09.200 --> 3:06:16.000]  flippantly doctors write COVID-19 as the cause on the patient files i'm not even talking about that
[3:06:16.000 --> 3:06:23.200]  which is rampant as well i'm talking about something that is much more sinister and real
[3:06:23.200 --> 3:06:32.480]  and happening all the time that is what is going on and that is why looking into these death numbers
[3:06:32.480 --> 3:06:38.880]  which i just just did the 81 percent and the 93 percent is so important to understand we'll be
[3:06:38.880 --> 3:06:45.280]  back after this very cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left it can be very stressful
[3:06:45.280 --> 3:06:51.280]  dealing with facts you refuse to accept if you have a family member suffering from this degenerative
[3:06:51.280 --> 3:06:57.520]  mental condition buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store dot com studies have
[3:06:57.520 --> 3:07:03.600]  suggested that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure decrease
[3:07:03.600 --> 3:07:09.360]  triglyceride levels decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in
[3:07:09.360 --> 3:07:15.520]  inflammatory responses and joints and the digestive system recent studies have suggested
[3:07:15.520 --> 3:07:22.560]  that high epa and dha fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration
[3:07:22.560 --> 3:07:29.200]  and activity of immune cells it worked for my family and now i can have a logical and calm
[3:07:29.200 --> 3:07:35.680]  discussion about actual facts that pertain to reality get your ultimate fish oil for a friend
[3:07:35.680 --> 3:07:42.000]  family member or yourself at info wars store dot com so what's the most important part let's say in
[3:07:42.000 --> 3:07:47.280]  a bulldozer running over the globalist the treads the wheels the engine the scoop on the front it's
[3:07:47.280 --> 3:07:53.520]  all very important but the fuel is paramount and that's my allegoral turbo force is vitamins
[3:07:53.520 --> 3:07:58.320]  minerals amino acids that synergistically work with six different natural forms of healthy
[3:07:58.320 --> 3:08:02.880]  clean energy that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system metabolism of a human
[3:08:02.880 --> 3:08:06.800]  some people get 15 hours some people get about eight hours but people take this people taking
[3:08:06.800 --> 3:08:12.000]  sports people cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not high nobody puts as much
[3:08:12.000 --> 3:08:17.600]  product into their pre workouts their post-workout you can call us whatever you want it's it's a
[3:08:17.600 --> 3:08:23.120]  it's a total solution all around the best you're gonna find turbo force without you we don't roll
[3:08:23.120 --> 3:08:27.360]  with you we search forward together it's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel if we don't
[3:08:27.360 --> 3:08:31.120]  have your financial support we will be defeated you support us to get products you already need
[3:08:31.120 --> 3:08:36.640]  that literally fuel your body your mind it's a win-win 360 together info or store.com or triple
[3:08:36.640 --> 3:09:02.160]  eight two five three three one three nine you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:09:02.160 --> 3:09:10.800]  John Rappaport here for the next segment on info wars okay i want to remind you of something
[3:09:12.080 --> 3:09:17.680]  in case you've forgotten or you missed it and that has to do with the diagnosis of COVID-19
[3:09:19.840 --> 3:09:27.040]  a cough or chills and fever and a person could be diagnosed with COVID-19
[3:09:27.040 --> 3:09:38.640]  that's it now if you read the cdc definition they'll say and a positive pcr test but as i've
[3:09:38.640 --> 3:09:45.120]  described in agonizing detail on the show before and written about many articles that test spits
[3:09:45.120 --> 3:09:53.200]  out false positives like firehose for various reasons and so it's very easy to come up with a
[3:09:53.200 --> 3:10:02.000]  positive reading on a pcr test and then with a cough or chills and fever
[3:10:03.360 --> 3:10:12.080]  COVID-19 so people wonder well is it possible that they're repackaging flu as COVID-19
[3:10:12.080 --> 3:10:22.720]  possible are you kidding me it's obviously going on now we're talking about case numbers
[3:10:24.240 --> 3:10:30.480]  where they say oh there's you know 17 million of these and those and whatever cases
[3:10:34.240 --> 3:10:41.360]  that's the firehose that's like well the guy has symptoms that are really no different than a light
[3:10:41.360 --> 3:10:51.280]  cold or an easy case of what used to call the flu but a positive pcr test and looking yeah okay let's
[3:10:51.280 --> 3:11:01.120]  call it COVID-19 and then the hysterical coverage on the news when they start showing you the clock
[3:11:01.120 --> 3:11:07.280]  and the oh we got this there's 100,000 more cases and 200,000 more cases and whatever whatever
[3:11:07.280 --> 3:11:17.600]  whatever whatever whatever that's what's going on then of course with the quote heavier cases
[3:11:18.400 --> 3:11:24.640]  of COVID-19 you would get something like pneumonia she was but the trouble again you see is
[3:11:25.200 --> 3:11:36.480]  what's called pneumonia has many many different causes historic and there are millions of cases
[3:11:36.480 --> 3:11:44.480]  of pneumonia traditionally across the world every year and always have been before anybody thought
[3:11:44.480 --> 3:11:53.360]  of COVID-19 so to say well we've got pneumonia over here but we've got COVID pneumonia over there
[3:11:54.400 --> 3:12:03.520]  it doesn't fly it's ridiculous that distinction is a distinction without a difference it's
[3:12:03.520 --> 3:12:11.520]  ridiculous but it's a good con if you want to believe the numbers that the news is spouting
[3:12:13.360 --> 3:12:21.120]  and that's what's going on with that in fact in China roughly 300,000 people a year die from
[3:12:21.120 --> 3:12:30.160]  pneumonia traditionally which means millions of cases so in whatever it was December of 2019
[3:12:30.160 --> 3:12:38.240]  January 2020 when they suddenly began reporting an outbreak of the serious pneumonia in Wuhan
[3:12:39.680 --> 3:12:44.960]  they were basically talking about something that happened all the time in China pneumonia
[3:12:45.680 --> 3:12:52.720]  only now they decided to compartmentalize it off and make a big deal out of it and say well this
[3:12:52.720 --> 3:12:57.520]  is different this is strange this is where this oh we have to get the experts in here oh we have
[3:12:57.520 --> 3:13:03.360]  to find a virus oh there it is oh we're going to call it SARS-CoV-2 oh here we go oh spreading
[3:13:03.360 --> 3:13:10.480]  across the world blah blah blah blah blah blah when in fact over the city of Wuhan and other major
[3:13:10.480 --> 3:13:19.440]  cities as I've reported before there is constantly deadly deadly air pollution composed of ingredients
[3:13:20.160 --> 3:13:26.080]  in a mixture that has never been observed before has never existed before in human history
[3:13:26.080 --> 3:13:31.680]  from both early and modern industrial air eras
[3:13:34.720 --> 3:13:44.000]  hello you know there's the obvious explanation for the cases of pneumonia but that doesn't create
[3:13:44.000 --> 3:13:51.840]  the fear of the pandemic of the publicity the government stepping in the Chinese government
[3:13:51.840 --> 3:13:56.960]  locking down that all the other governments following suit with the Chinese model doesn't
[3:13:56.960 --> 3:14:03.920]  create any of that at all so the planners had to go a different way they had to say this is unique
[3:14:03.920 --> 3:14:09.280]  this is new this is different now we have a killer virus as spreading all over the world and we have
[3:14:09.280 --> 3:14:16.960]  to lock everybody down and we have to destroy the economy of the plan in the process and we
[3:14:16.960 --> 3:14:23.280]  can never return to the old days we're going to have to enter normal with a great reset and universal
[3:14:23.280 --> 3:14:30.400]  guaranteed income and wall-to-wall surveillance in real time and your behavior is linked to universal
[3:14:30.400 --> 3:14:36.640]  guaranteed income you'll receive a check every month if you behave but if you vary from described
[3:14:36.640 --> 3:14:42.000]  behavior your money will be cut or eliminated altogether and you'll be out on the street
[3:14:42.000 --> 3:14:47.680]  you'll start to death and if you want to go to work for a major corporation or travel
[3:14:47.680 --> 3:14:51.840]  you're going to have to get vaccinated with an experimental vaccine that's never tried on the
[3:14:51.840 --> 3:15:03.360]  public before because it's been too dangerous with a technology called RNA get it that's the
[3:15:03.360 --> 3:15:08.800]  progression folks that's how it was built that's where it leads that's where it goes
[3:15:08.800 --> 3:15:17.760]  it's no accident that you've now got the CEO of United Airlines following on the heels of the
[3:15:17.760 --> 3:15:26.640]  Qantas CEO a couple of months ago saying oh yes you're going to need proof of vaccination if you
[3:15:26.640 --> 3:15:37.920]  want to travel and this CEO is now openly enlisting the cooperation of other CEOs of major
[3:15:37.920 --> 3:15:46.800]  corporations to climb on board with this mandate for a vaccine he is openly saying I can't do this
[3:15:46.800 --> 3:15:52.800]  alone hey United Airlines is not going to stand alone in all of this because then we won't win
[3:15:53.760 --> 3:16:03.120]  the battle to mandate the vaccine so what's not being said here what's not being said is
[3:16:03.120 --> 3:16:08.960]  that the federal government is putting pressure on these corporations to handle the mandates because
[3:16:09.600 --> 3:16:18.720]  it's not easy to get a federal mandate to vaccinate everybody against COVID in the US
[3:16:20.000 --> 3:16:30.000]  it's not easy it will run into many many obstacles even if a law were passed at the federal level
[3:16:30.000 --> 3:16:35.840]  there would be many constitutional and legal challenges you can bet your bottom dollar on that
[3:16:36.560 --> 3:16:45.440]  so for at least for the moment it's up to the states and major corporations that's why this guy
[3:16:45.440 --> 3:16:51.600]  is appearing now the CEO of United Airlines because what's the first thing people think of
[3:16:51.600 --> 3:16:57.920]  when they think of the lifting of restrictions well they certainly think of going outside and
[3:16:57.920 --> 3:17:03.760]  going back to work yes but the next thing is travel i want to travel i want to go places i
[3:17:03.760 --> 3:17:10.960]  want to see things i want to visit family and so forth yes we understand we who are controlling
[3:17:10.960 --> 3:17:20.560]  you so therefore we say hey if you want to travel you got to get the vaccine if you want to travel
[3:17:20.560 --> 3:17:27.200]  you got to get the vaccine uh-huh you get it you get it you get it if you want to live a normal
[3:17:27.200 --> 3:17:36.000]  life you got to get the vaccine that's what's happening stay with us we'll be back after the
[3:17:36.000 --> 3:17:37.200]  recording.
[3:17:37.200 --> 3:17:43.440]  Webster's dictionary has a very simple definition of terrorism other dictionaries have similar ones
[3:17:44.080 --> 3:17:51.040]  terrorism is the threat of force or action carrying out force for a political or financial reason
[3:17:51.600 --> 3:17:56.480]  it's basically scaring the hell out of people until you submit to them that's exactly what
[3:17:56.480 --> 3:18:02.240]  all this overblown COVID-19 garbage is you see the headlines from CNN ABC News doctors say it's
[3:18:02.240 --> 3:18:08.400]  worse than they ever thought COVID more devastating than you'd ever imagine they told us that two and
[3:18:08.400 --> 3:18:14.480]  a half million people would be dead just eight months ago within three months okay it's a quarter
[3:18:14.480 --> 3:18:20.480]  million if you count all of the people that died of other things we're talking 96 had comorbidity
[3:18:20.480 --> 3:18:25.600]  these are real numbers these are real facts this is the chicken little event we all run our houses
[3:18:25.600 --> 3:18:29.760]  never come out and are taught we're not essential although big box stores in amazon take over the
[3:18:29.760 --> 3:18:36.080]  planet you could stand up against it this is slavery it is not something you could put up with and
[3:18:36.080 --> 3:18:44.800]  survive info wars is a archetypal classic example of free independent organic resistance against
[3:18:44.800 --> 3:18:51.760]  tyranny you built info wars you spread the word you prayed for us you bought the products you called
[3:18:51.760 --> 3:18:58.000]  in you made recommendations info wars is as much yours as it is mine and that's why the enemy is so
[3:18:58.000 --> 3:19:03.600]  upset that under the deplatforming under all the dnc lawsuits under all the attack in many ways
[3:19:03.600 --> 3:19:09.760]  we become stronger with bandot video redesigned info wars with all of our great crew with documentary
[3:19:09.760 --> 3:19:16.960]  films and ten hours of live radio and tv a day we are the resistance you are the resistance so

[3:20:42.800 --> 3:20:50.800]  so
[3:21:00.480 --> 3:21:02.800]  kind of have to port back here on info wars
[3:21:04.800 --> 3:21:11.120]  so i was talking about travel and the airlines of course leading the way by saying well if you
[3:21:11.120 --> 3:21:16.720]  want to travel and everybody does got to get the vaccine got to get the vaccine got to get the
[3:21:16.720 --> 3:21:23.920]  vaccine what about all those nurses that you've been hearing and reading about around the country
[3:21:24.720 --> 3:21:29.760]  that are resusing the vaccine i guess they're not going to fly right
[3:21:32.320 --> 3:21:35.680]  think about that i guess they're willing not to fly
[3:21:35.680 --> 3:21:48.400]  which amounts to a boycott at least that's the way it looks isn't and well if you say
[3:21:49.680 --> 3:21:56.160]  we have to get the vaccine in order to fly then i guess we won't fly
[3:21:56.160 --> 3:22:05.680]  now it's the numbers of people who are turning down the vaccine get large enough
[3:22:08.400 --> 3:22:14.480]  what happens i don't know how the airlines are going to survive
[3:22:16.560 --> 3:22:21.760]  they think they're in the position of control well we control you because you see if you
[3:22:21.760 --> 3:22:26.880]  don't get the vaccine you can't travel okay well guess who won't travel by air
[3:22:29.200 --> 3:22:29.760]  guess not
[3:22:32.640 --> 3:22:38.960]  is that enough to a boycott well it sounds like a boycott it may not be direct
[3:22:40.320 --> 3:22:46.800]  but if they start dictating conditions and you don't want to go along with the conditions
[3:22:46.800 --> 3:22:52.800]  it's like somebody saying well we're selling you a product you see we're a company all right
[3:22:52.800 --> 3:22:59.920]  we're selling you a product but you can only buy the product under certain conditions
[3:23:00.800 --> 3:23:06.960]  right really i just want to buy the product no it's not that easy it doesn't work that way
[3:23:08.000 --> 3:23:16.000]  we have a list of conditions here that you have to you know satisfy in order to buy the
[3:23:16.000 --> 3:23:22.880]  product from us who are selling it sounds a little strange doesn't know well that's the way we do
[3:23:22.880 --> 3:23:29.120]  business okay well what are the conditions well here they are one two three oh i see i see
[3:23:29.120 --> 3:23:37.360]  oh this one here that's right gotta get vaccinated so in other words if i don't then i can't buy
[3:23:37.360 --> 3:23:44.640]  your product yeah that's right we're standing up for that we won't sell you the product and neither
[3:23:44.640 --> 3:23:53.040]  will our colleagues who are in our competitors will own other airlines if you don't meet this
[3:23:53.040 --> 3:24:00.640]  condition you can't buy their product either all right well it sounds like you're kind of shoving
[3:24:00.640 --> 3:24:08.160]  us out of the the market out of your market of potential customers it sounds like you're pushing
[3:24:08.160 --> 3:24:18.720]  us away so i guess we'll take the hint you don't want us to participate you don't want us to fork
[3:24:18.720 --> 3:24:27.920]  over our money to buy your product okay all right that's the way you want it that's the way it'll be
[3:24:30.880 --> 3:24:36.880]  and if the number of people who are turning down the vaccine as reports continue to surface
[3:24:36.880 --> 3:24:44.720]  about people having serious adverse reactions keeling over dying if that number of people
[3:24:44.720 --> 3:24:53.680]  who turn down the vaccine keeps expanding these companies they decide that they're gonna alter
[3:24:53.680 --> 3:25:05.360]  their conditions wouldn't you if you were the head of a company okay what else here let's move on to
[3:25:05.360 --> 3:25:13.680]  yet another story i don't know what i covered this lately in the next five minutes or so but
[3:25:15.440 --> 3:25:20.640]  let's start anyway this has to do with antifa and the lm black lives in heaven
[3:25:20.640 --> 3:25:32.800]  the publicity the pr the spear of the movement appears to be
[3:25:35.200 --> 3:25:40.640]  standing from police shootings of innocent black people
[3:25:43.200 --> 3:25:48.720]  that's what that's what the news is saying that's what the groups are saying police brutality
[3:25:48.720 --> 3:26:00.160]  okay all right now if you took an objective look i don't care whether you're white black
[3:26:00.720 --> 3:26:12.320]  green blue orange purple if you took a look at neighborhoods inner city poverty stricken
[3:26:12.320 --> 3:26:24.400]  neighborhoods okay and you interviewed people mainly don't listen to the men listen to the women
[3:26:24.400 --> 3:26:30.320]  the mothers in particular of children who raise their children many many of them
[3:26:31.200 --> 3:26:38.400]  in single parent households what the biggest problems really are in those neighborhoods
[3:26:38.400 --> 3:26:45.920]  and i would be willing to bet once you've got these mothers to speak with you honestly they
[3:26:45.920 --> 3:27:00.880]  would say drugs gangs crime drugs gangs crime shootings violence dangerous streets gangs
[3:27:00.880 --> 3:27:10.240]  crime drugs recruitment of young children into gangs
[3:27:14.480 --> 3:27:22.480]  but of course we're not hearing about that from antifa or blm or from politicians
[3:27:22.480 --> 3:27:30.480]  not just talking now about antifa feeling not hearing that politicians not hearing it's from
[3:27:30.480 --> 3:27:40.880]  major media news we're not hearing about it from educators or social scientists or psychologists
[3:27:40.880 --> 3:27:55.200]  academicians universities think tanks nothing in the mainstream about the major problem
[3:27:56.640 --> 3:28:04.000]  going on in these neighborhoods which by the way and not just casually makes it extremely
[3:28:04.000 --> 3:28:09.520]  difficult for outside investment money to come in to finance any kind of economic
[3:28:09.520 --> 3:28:14.880]  traction and growth of businesses in these inner city communities
[3:28:18.000 --> 3:28:29.280]  so what about the gang problem in these areas and i'll put this to you
[3:28:31.360 --> 3:28:36.000]  do you remember when certain mafia families in new york were wiped out
[3:28:36.000 --> 3:28:46.640]  out by court cases and what preceded those court cases it was a new federal law called rico
[3:28:47.520 --> 3:28:56.480]  r i c o that was the acronym and it was basically a law which permitted prosecutions
[3:28:56.480 --> 3:29:10.320]  of continuing criminal enterprises okay which mobs are gangs significant gangs are that
[3:29:12.880 --> 3:29:19.760]  and certain mafia families in the new york new jersey area were dismantled at the top
[3:29:19.760 --> 3:29:31.280]  in the middle with these rico prosecutions think it through folks
[3:29:33.840 --> 3:29:41.280]  could these rico prosecutions be leveled at inner city black neighborhood gangs big gangs
[3:29:42.640 --> 3:29:48.400]  as continuing criminal enterprises you bet you you could bet the farm on that
[3:29:48.400 --> 3:29:56.320]  that you could bet the absolute bottom dollar you've got on that the evidence is everywhere
[3:29:57.200 --> 3:30:05.120]  that these are violent criminal predatory continuing criminal enterprises
[3:30:06.960 --> 3:30:16.640]  they could be in other words legally dismantled in not just one city say chicago
[3:30:16.640 --> 3:30:26.720]  but a number of key cities and i'm not just talking about now i'm talking about ever since the rico
[3:30:26.720 --> 3:30:35.520]  laws were passed that could have been the case so why wasn't it and why isn't the answer after
[3:30:35.520 --> 3:30:42.400]  break the ultimate fluoride free charcoal mouthwash is now available at info wars store

[3:35:10.640 --> 3:35:18.800]  okay last second here john rapaport last second this hour talking about gangs in inner city black
[3:35:18.800 --> 3:35:26.480]  neighborhood serious gangs which if you interview the mothers they will tell you when they're
[3:35:26.480 --> 3:35:36.720]  speaking honestly this is the major the most serious problems neighborhoods drugs gangs crime
[3:35:37.280 --> 3:35:46.960]  shooting recruitment danger it all goes back to these gangs which as i detailed in last segment
[3:35:46.960 --> 3:35:56.480]  could be prosecuted under riko as continuing criminal enterprises no doubt about it and can
[3:35:56.480 --> 3:36:03.760]  you imagine and please try what these neighborhoods would look like if the influence of gangs was
[3:36:03.760 --> 3:36:13.040]  severely severely severely hampered and reduced it would be a whole new world okay so how come
[3:36:13.040 --> 3:36:22.880]  how come we're not seeing these riko prosecutions several reasons but i want to list one very important
[3:36:22.880 --> 3:36:32.320]  reason how do these gangs make their money to sell drugs where do the drugs come from
[3:36:32.320 --> 3:36:45.040]  from drug cartels mexico other countries and reports on duris venezuela etc serious now
[3:36:45.040 --> 3:36:55.440]  we're talking drug cartels so the gangs in america some of them are operating as subcontractors
[3:36:55.440 --> 3:37:09.680]  to major drug cartels as distributors not just on the street that too but also as what they would
[3:37:09.680 --> 3:37:17.760]  call trans ship points say from chicago to other cities and so on so forth vital part of the network
[3:37:17.760 --> 3:37:29.680]  of distributors these gangs are another question what is one of the main problems of the drug cartels
[3:37:31.360 --> 3:37:40.640]  what to do with all their cash and all their cash we're talking about a whole pile of cash folks
[3:37:40.640 --> 3:37:48.640]  trillions of dollars over time they got to wash it they got to launder it how do they
[3:37:48.640 --> 3:37:55.040]  launder it well one of the major ways is through banks banks
[3:37:58.320 --> 3:38:04.720]  and how about big corporations that need loans etc let's focus on banks
[3:38:04.720 --> 3:38:15.520]  so we've got now excuse me not only gangs but we've got drug cartels and banks in the mix
[3:38:18.000 --> 3:38:26.560]  does that begin to tell you why there are no rico prosecutions of gangs in inner cities serious
[3:38:26.560 --> 3:38:38.640]  gangs in america or to put it another way what would happen if tomorrow antifa and blm began to
[3:38:39.280 --> 3:38:51.760]  stage peaceful peaceful street protests against drug cartels and banks as the targets
[3:38:51.760 --> 3:39:00.400]  and informing and educating people that this is the primary factor that is destroying inner city
[3:39:00.400 --> 3:39:08.720]  black neighborhoods yeah we're here on the street and we're protesting drug cartels and banks
[3:39:09.600 --> 3:39:16.880]  really what is this all about you know says some naive reporter well let me tell you here's what
[3:39:16.880 --> 3:39:23.520]  it's about you see the gangs are distributing drugs for the drug cartels so the gangs are essential
[3:39:24.400 --> 3:39:29.840]  drug cartels wash their money through major banks you see the whole network how it looks
[3:39:30.640 --> 3:39:37.440]  now the gangs could be prosecuted under rico and destroyed but they aren't why not because
[3:39:37.440 --> 3:39:43.840]  they're a vital link in the chain of drug trafficking around the us and the major media
[3:39:43.840 --> 3:39:52.400]  reporter goes wow i didn't know that and the blm member says well now you do now you do now you
[3:39:52.400 --> 3:39:57.920]  know something you didn't before you're going to put it on the news well sure the naive reporter
[3:39:57.920 --> 3:40:03.680]  says he gets back and he kills his editor wow we got a whole new story blm is going in a whole new
[3:40:03.680 --> 3:40:10.320]  direction wow this is going to be fantastic we got to talk to lebron james hey he's a big
[3:40:10.320 --> 3:40:16.560]  isn't he a supporter of blm does he know about this about the other network and the drug cartels
[3:40:16.560 --> 3:40:22.400]  and the banks and so maybe he knows us we got an interview on his editor says hold on baby
[3:40:24.240 --> 3:40:32.400]  are you kidding there's no way we're going to air that story that you just picked up on the
[3:40:32.400 --> 3:40:37.200]  street what do you mean we're not going to air that this is big this is breaking news in fact
[3:40:37.200 --> 3:40:45.200]  uh this is nothing this is this is just opinion in here so no i mean these are organized groups
[3:40:45.200 --> 3:40:52.160]  uh out on the street uh protesting and they've got educational material on uh the drug cartels
[3:40:52.160 --> 3:40:57.920]  and the banks and the gangs and riko and no no no no no no no we're not touching that story with
[3:40:57.920 --> 3:41:05.760]  the 10 people we're not going after that well why not then yeah naive reporter says we just aren't
[3:41:05.760 --> 3:41:11.840]  it's just not in the cards we've talked about that before it's old news nobody's interested in that
[3:41:12.480 --> 3:41:18.880]  they're only interested in police brutality and that's what i put it says whoa whoa whoa whoa
[3:41:18.880 --> 3:41:29.920]  i got a story here mr editor i want to run with it and the editor says really you want to risk
[3:41:29.920 --> 3:41:37.920]  your budding career on a story that i who've been around the block of 2000 times telling you
[3:41:38.480 --> 3:41:44.560]  not to touch with a 10-foot pole really is that what's going on here you're telling me
[3:41:45.520 --> 3:41:52.560]  that you insist on running this story well maybe what you want to do is to quit your job here at
[3:41:52.560 --> 3:42:00.720]  the times and start a little blog somewhere on your own out of wherever it was that you were raised
[3:42:01.520 --> 3:42:08.080]  some little two-bit town somewhere i can't remember even the name of it now and see you
[3:42:08.080 --> 3:42:15.840]  can expose that story on that little blog is that what you want because if you keep throwing this
[3:42:15.840 --> 3:42:20.640]  story in my face that's where you're going to end up that's what's going to happen to you
[3:42:20.640 --> 3:42:27.200]  that's going to happen to your little career because you're on track to make a significant
[3:42:27.200 --> 3:42:35.360]  amount of money and to have some kind of reputation in this business we call the news but you've
[3:42:35.360 --> 3:42:43.120]  got to keep your nose clean and i don't know who that blm person you spoke with was or what he said
[3:42:43.120 --> 3:42:50.800]  but he's leading you down the garden path through a place you do not want to go believe me son
[3:42:51.440 --> 3:42:58.720]  you do not want to go there now you go back to your little desk and you think about this
[3:42:59.520 --> 3:43:04.560]  and it's up to you as to what you want to do up to you
[3:43:04.560 --> 3:43:11.360]  you yeah that's the way it works so that's why
[3:43:14.080 --> 3:43:24.720]  instead these groups like blm and antifa are functioning and i'm not saying this is
[3:43:25.840 --> 3:43:33.920]  intentional among its members but they are functioning as diversions from what they say
[3:43:33.920 --> 3:43:41.120]  they're trying to accomplish which is to improve life in inner cities they are diverting attention
[3:43:41.120 --> 3:43:47.120]  from what the real problem is in those areas or the biggest problem let's say which is gangs
[3:43:49.600 --> 3:43:57.120]  that's what's happening and that's what the uh celebrities and the virtue signaling
[3:43:57.120 --> 3:44:06.080]  uh lefties uh and the celebrity athletes are not paying any attention to whatsoever
[3:44:07.360 --> 3:44:12.800]  because if they were if they were actually looking into what's going on instead of just
[3:44:12.800 --> 3:44:22.080]  buying the publicity and the pr and they think they're really solving the problem that they
[3:44:22.080 --> 3:44:30.560]  want to solve they would be saying something completely different one of these star athletes
[3:44:30.560 --> 3:44:35.680]  would be sitting on a talk show on the sports network saying you know really what we need
[3:44:35.680 --> 3:44:46.480]  to be protesting against is the drug cartels and the banks what really yeah we're live aren't we
[3:44:46.480 --> 3:44:53.280]  yeah we are so far i mean where do you where do you get this from what do you mean you mean that
[3:44:53.280 --> 3:44:59.200]  blm should be protesting against what did you say drug cartels and banks
[3:45:00.960 --> 3:45:07.360]  whoa whoa whoa whoa we got to go to commercial here thanks for being on the show uh we'll be
[3:45:07.360 --> 3:45:13.840]  talking to you soon there's a lot of things folks in this country and the world that could be turned
[3:45:13.840 --> 3:45:21.040]  around with a certain degree of truth that are very important and that's one of them and that's
[3:45:21.040 --> 3:45:45.120]  to me for this week talk to you next time
