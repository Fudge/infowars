[00:00.000 --> 00:20.320]  Ladies and gentlemen, it's Thursday, March 12th,
[00:20.320 --> 00:25.920]  2020. I am your host, Alex Jones. There is now no longer any doubt that the coronavirus is a man
[00:25.920 --> 00:31.120]  made by a weapon launched to bring down the United States of America by the chai comms and the
[00:31.120 --> 00:35.120]  deep state globalists. And I can tell you that I have talked to individuals that are inside the
[00:35.120 --> 00:40.480]  White House and inside the governor's office here in Texas and that is what they believe is going
[00:40.480 --> 00:46.160]  on. That's why President Trump has classified all the White House discussions about the coronavirus
[00:46.160 --> 00:51.200]  and I think the president's response so far has been dead on. He just finished speaking a few
[00:51.200 --> 00:55.920]  minutes ago, started 15 minutes ago, from the Oval Office taking questions on coronavirus.
[00:55.920 --> 01:25.760]  Here's some of what the president had to say.
[01:25.920 --> 01:41.760]  It has an obvious effect. The only thing worse can be that you lose thousands and thousands of
[01:41.760 --> 01:46.480]  people more than you would have lost if you did it the way we're doing it. So it certainly has an
[01:46.480 --> 01:51.600]  impact and again we're very much working with the states because you know the states are a smaller
[01:51.600 --> 01:56.640]  form of government they can control. I want to speak with you about our nation's unprecedented
[01:56.640 --> 02:03.120]  response to the coronavirus outbreak that started in China and is now spreading throughout the world.
[02:04.160 --> 02:10.160]  Today the World Health Organization officially announced that this is a global pandemic.
[02:11.200 --> 02:16.160]  We have been in frequent contact with our allies and we are marshaling the full power
[02:16.160 --> 02:22.320]  of the federal government and the private sector to protect the American people. This is the most
[02:22.320 --> 02:28.640]  aggressive and comprehensive effort to confront a foreign virus in modern history. I am confident
[02:28.640 --> 02:35.760]  that by counting and continuing to take these tough measures we will significantly reduce
[02:35.760 --> 02:42.160]  the threat to our citizens and we will ultimately and expeditiously defeat this virus. From the
[02:42.160 --> 02:48.880]  beginning of time nations and people have faced unforeseen challenges including large scale and
[02:48.880 --> 02:57.360]  very dangerous health threats. This is the way it always was and always will be. It only matters
[02:57.360 --> 03:03.440]  how you respond and we are responding with great speed and professionalism. Our team is the best
[03:03.440 --> 03:09.920]  anywhere in the world. At the very start of the outbreak we instituted sweeping travel restrictions
[03:09.920 --> 03:17.760]  on China and put in place the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years. We declared
[03:17.760 --> 03:24.960]  a public health emergency and issued the highest level of travel warning on other countries as
[03:24.960 --> 03:33.600]  the virus spread its horrible infection. And taking early intense action we have seen dramatically
[03:33.600 --> 03:41.120]  fewer cases of the virus in the United States than are now present in Europe. The European Union
[03:41.120 --> 03:47.840]  failed to take the same precautions and restrict travel from China and other hotspots. As a result
[03:47.840 --> 03:54.000]  a large number of new clusters in the United States were seated by travelers from Europe.
[03:54.640 --> 03:59.840]  After consulting with our top government health professionals I have decided to take several
[03:59.840 --> 04:05.200]  strong but necessary actions to protect the health and well-being of all Americans.
[04:06.000 --> 04:12.320]  To keep new cases from entering our shores we will be suspending all travel from Europe
[04:12.320 --> 04:18.960]  to the United States for the next 30 days. The new rules will go into effect Friday at midnight.
[04:19.520 --> 04:25.440]  These restrictions will be adjusted subject to conditions on the ground. There will be exemptions
[04:25.440 --> 04:31.200]  for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings and these prohibitions will not only
[04:31.200 --> 04:38.080]  apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo but various other things as we get approval.
[04:38.880 --> 04:44.640]  Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing. These restrictions
[04:44.640 --> 04:51.360]  will also not apply to the United Kingdom. At the same time we are monitoring the situation
[04:51.360 --> 04:57.840]  in China and the South Korea and as their situation improves we will re-evaluate the
[04:57.840 --> 05:00.800]  restrictions and warnings. It's really smart to get high-quality
[05:00.800 --> 05:05.680]  storedable food at mfoldwarestore.com. It's also smart to drink filtered water with an

[05:56.160 --> 06:11.440]  today at infowarstore.com. Crashing through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones coming to
[06:11.440 --> 06:31.280]  you live from the front lines of the info war. We are live ladies and gentlemen on this Thursday
[06:31.280 --> 06:39.200]  March 12th 2020 transmission with 235 days out from the historic election. Well we knew the
[06:39.200 --> 06:47.040]  globalist would be striking back and indeed they have done just that. There can be no doubt that
[06:47.040 --> 06:52.880]  the coronavirus is a man-made bio weapon. The entire global media, the big banks, all of our
[06:52.880 --> 06:57.840]  enemies have been hyping it to bring down the United States and are now doing everything they can to
[06:57.840 --> 07:06.080]  exacerbate just all out total lemming like hysteria taking place. Now there's a paradox in all of that.
[07:06.080 --> 07:12.400]  We predicted it was going to cause all-out world panic. We predicted it was going to
[07:12.400 --> 07:18.800]  cause the shutdown of civilization for several months as a giant globalist martial law drill
[07:19.440 --> 07:24.640]  over the nation state that would then finally target the United States economy and President
[07:24.640 --> 07:29.920]  Trump's reelection. So we were right to say it's incredibly dangerous this is a big deal
[07:29.920 --> 07:35.680]  and yes the virus clearly does kill people but if you see the deep state preparation all over
[07:35.680 --> 07:45.360]  the world and the U.S. ahead of this you can see the coordination the choreography the scripting
[07:45.360 --> 07:52.560]  that's taking place telling us that this is a 21st century attack and a lot of people are seeing
[07:52.560 --> 07:57.280]  that they're saying that and I've talked to a high-level White House sources and I've talked to
[07:57.280 --> 08:04.080]  sources in the Texas government at the highest levels that believe this is a deep state operation
[08:04.080 --> 08:12.880]  allied with communist China or elements of communist China that was meant to basically be a giant
[08:12.880 --> 08:20.560]  lockdown drill over the public and again that the left could then exacerbate and target and point
[08:20.560 --> 08:27.680]  at President Trump and at America. Let me tell you who's coming up today Mike Adams
[08:28.480 --> 08:32.240]  who's certainly been vindicated on saying this was going to cause a shutdown on society
[08:32.240 --> 08:36.320]  he's going to be on the bottom of the hour we're going to have Dr. Steve Pachennick on to give us
[08:36.320 --> 08:43.520]  his perspective and his take Milo Yiannopoulos is going to be in studio with us as well
[08:47.600 --> 08:52.480]  Angel Scalzen is going to be popping on a world of first briefs so a lot of different expert
[08:52.480 --> 08:58.960]  takes and angles but there's no longer any doubt this is a big deal that this is not a drill
[08:58.960 --> 09:06.400]  and President Trump has really changed the trajectory of the viral spread by stopping
[09:06.400 --> 09:14.080]  flights from Europe where it's really broken out very badly and where he knows there's
[09:14.080 --> 09:22.240]  more deadly strains of it now I was locked and loaded and I'm not complaining hours of focus
[09:22.240 --> 09:27.440]  with just totally ready to come on air and lay out their entire master plan it's crystallized
[09:27.440 --> 09:32.240]  for me last night this morning I'm sure of it I've done massive research and then the president
[09:32.800 --> 09:36.480]  starts getting ready to speak again and I say well let me just start the show with that and
[09:36.480 --> 09:40.320]  of course the computer freezes up and that's just the way it works then I get angry and
[09:40.320 --> 09:46.000]  my train of thought gets lost but I'm rebuilding it back up I've got all the lines converging and
[09:46.000 --> 09:49.760]  the data and the way I want to lay it out but I'm going to go to rebroadcast for a while to
[09:49.760 --> 09:55.040]  cool down it's not the cruise fault it's not anybody's fault stuff's happening live so I can
[09:55.040 --> 10:01.760]  can get laser focused again and come back in here and get on the racing blocks before I lay all this
[10:01.760 --> 10:08.000]  out so I'm gonna do the best job I can to just just just calm down and then I'm gonna come back
[10:08.000 --> 10:13.600]  and lay this out because I'm not just up here babbling I'm not just up here saying things that
[10:13.600 --> 10:19.040]  I think sound interesting I really have studied the entire system and I know how it works and I've
[10:19.040 --> 10:23.520]  gone and studied the virus and I've had top bio weapons experts on and top medical doctors on
[10:23.520 --> 10:28.160]  and the lawyer that wrote the U.S. bio weapons the convention that became world law and we
[10:29.120 --> 10:33.600]  we know what we're talking about here and so you could tune into David Knight and hear what he's
[10:33.600 --> 10:37.520]  saying and think we're disagreeing or you could tune in to Gerald Salente this morning and think
[10:37.520 --> 10:41.600]  well Alex disagrees with him or you could tune in to Owen Schreuer and think well well Owen
[10:41.600 --> 10:45.760]  Schreuer is saying something different than Alex Jones or Mike Adams or Steve Akinick and that's
[10:45.760 --> 10:51.920]  not really what's happening that's not what's happening we're covering different aspects
[10:51.920 --> 10:59.840]  of a very sophisticated shy-op mind control operation that its heart has a real virus
[11:00.400 --> 11:06.960]  that is mutating and is killing people but people then say well it must be hype the hype's so obvious
[11:06.960 --> 11:14.480]  yes they're fanning the flames they're pushing it to create the most amount of hysteria so do you
[11:14.480 --> 11:19.600]  have a wooden response as the British have and as Trump was trying to have and not create panic
[11:19.600 --> 11:25.680]  while trying to fix things behind the scenes or do you get ahead of it and say oh it's really bad
[11:26.400 --> 11:31.360]  and then kind of jump on the bandwagon of the police state clamp down so that the left can't
[11:31.360 --> 11:39.680]  then turn around and blame the nationalist and Trump it's a very very serious problem that needs
[11:39.680 --> 11:47.280]  very very serious thought and and let me put it to you this way the providence of the virus
[11:47.280 --> 11:58.080]  the genealogy of the virus where it came from who made it and why is the way to stop the deep
[11:58.080 --> 12:05.360]  state weaponizing the fear that this weapon has created and it's going back to the beginning
[12:06.640 --> 12:12.960]  back to who launched the attack back to who fan the flames who's been rubbing their hands together
[12:12.960 --> 12:17.680]  who's been saying they openly want to crash the US economy the democrats have been running around
[12:17.680 --> 12:27.040]  like weasels on a large dose of pcp just assaulting the nation assaulting the confidence
[12:27.040 --> 12:33.840]  assaulting the president while squeaking and squawking that oh he's not doing anything and
[12:33.840 --> 12:37.840]  then when he says okay no chinese flights four weeks ago oh that xenophobicest race is evil
[12:37.840 --> 12:42.880]  when everybody else already done it or he says okay no flights from europe unless you're vetted and
[12:42.880 --> 12:47.200]  they go oh my god it's horrible no we want to open the democrats to introduce a bill to stop that
[12:48.400 --> 12:54.880]  because they think logic doesn't exist in fact they've said everywhere cnn ms mbc how dare the president
[12:56.800 --> 13:03.920]  come out and say that this is a foreign virus well he knows they're blaming him he knows the public
[13:03.920 --> 13:09.200]  doesn't have an intention span anymore and so president trump rightfully like this is a chinese
[13:09.200 --> 13:15.200]  communist virus came from over there but we're dealing with it this is something humans have
[13:15.200 --> 13:20.480]  always had to deal with so let's not panic but we're gonna have a strong response i think the
[13:20.480 --> 13:26.720]  president's doing an excellent job i wasn't mad that he tried to play it down i knew it was a
[13:26.720 --> 13:31.600]  desperate gamble four weeks ago he knew they were targeting the economy the main generators
[13:31.600 --> 13:38.480]  that was her top of their target is the is the is the economy and i knew he was gonna lose because
[13:38.480 --> 13:46.480]  the whole media and the whole system was about to engage in this very good chance that tom hanks
[13:46.480 --> 13:52.000]  is a total globalist hates the president so he would never be president is just saying he's sick
[13:52.000 --> 13:57.120]  with it as part of a false positive your pr deal to overshadow the president's speech last night
[13:57.120 --> 14:02.160]  and because you look at who's pushing and big tech the globalist the chikoms the eu now the
[14:02.160 --> 14:09.200]  communist run italy uh the virtue signaling nba they want the crisis to implode the economy
[14:09.200 --> 14:12.720]  they said they want to get rid of the president by about economy now they're saying they hope it
[14:12.720 --> 14:17.360]  does drive him out by killing the economy they're open villains that think we're all idiots
[14:17.360 --> 14:27.280]  all right i'm gonna go to break and i'm gonna come back i don't need to go to rebroadcast i just
[14:28.320 --> 14:32.080]  how do you see to get laser focused and and just go into the main point i'm gonna make when we come
[14:32.080 --> 14:37.760]  back and that's where it came from who's behind it what the plan is and the really bad news and
[14:37.760 --> 14:43.520]  i'm gonna give you the bad news when we come back i figured it out and and we could walk through all
[14:43.520 --> 14:49.520]  the background and the viruses and the screens and who's behind it but this is going to make aids
[14:49.520 --> 14:56.560]  and hiv down the road look like a very mild problem and they have just introduced to you
[14:57.280 --> 15:02.560]  other depopulation program and so most of you won't even get sick or die from this but the next
[15:02.560 --> 15:08.800]  decade if we don't stop them most of you will die from this so there's there's a little news flash

[19:18.480 --> 19:23.520]  is alex jones and she just got her eyes got wide open and she says i'm really i thought he was off
[19:23.520 --> 19:29.120]  the air and i said no and i told her i explained you know the whole situation and told her where to
[19:29.120 --> 19:34.320]  go she wrote down you know band dot video and also info wars dot com and just said she's still on i
[19:34.320 --> 19:39.280]  run into people at the grocery store at the mall on the hiking bike trail and they go oh alex i used
[19:39.280 --> 19:42.640]  to love you i wish you were still on air are you ever gonna go back on air and i'm like we're on
[19:42.640 --> 19:46.080]  hundreds of radio stations over a hundred tv stations and cable stations we have our own streams
[19:46.080 --> 19:50.160]  at info wars dot com and band on video and they go really they said you were off the air because
[19:50.160 --> 20:00.320]  they took the platforming as off the air no we have our own platform info wars info wars info wars
[20:02.000 --> 20:12.320]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[20:12.320 --> 20:27.280]  he aligns himself with the truth and it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to alex jones
[20:31.040 --> 20:37.840]  on july 25th 2001 i went on my television show and on my radio show
[20:37.840 --> 20:42.560]  and i specifically said they're going to blow up the world trade center
[20:43.360 --> 20:47.040]  in the next few months and blame it on a son of inlaut and their cia asset
[20:47.920 --> 20:53.280]  they will use that then to take american freedoms and launch giant wars it will actually be used
[20:53.280 --> 20:59.040]  to destabilize the middle east towards a larger global conflict between islam and christianity
[20:59.600 --> 21:03.680]  in the future and out of that global conflict will come a world government
[21:03.680 --> 21:12.000]  now people ask how i was able to do that and their only answer is he must be a government
[21:12.000 --> 21:16.240]  agent somebody told him this the government is just a large conglomerate of individuals
[21:16.240 --> 21:22.080]  agencies and groups some good some bad i did not get that information from
[21:22.080 --> 21:32.160]  any person i was younger my brain was better i did not have as much knowledge at that point but
[21:33.680 --> 21:39.680]  i saw thousands of integrated points and pre-programming before the fact
[21:43.200 --> 21:50.400]  and with that much data it's called a police hunch people ask well how's that detector so good
[21:50.400 --> 21:53.760]  how does he know how to even though the surer killer only kills every few months
[21:54.320 --> 22:00.240]  track them and and and come up with mathematical equations and and and maps and then finally be
[22:00.240 --> 22:05.280]  there in the right zone and catch them trying to kidnap a woman on the very night there's been
[22:05.280 --> 22:09.120]  lots of cases of that and you'll talk to those famous detectives and they'll just finally just say
[22:10.560 --> 22:16.640]  i don't know how i do it and that's why detectives will go out the FBI does it too and they'll
[22:16.640 --> 22:22.000]  get psychics uh that aren't the con artists ones that have 1 800 numbers and you know
[22:22.000 --> 22:26.320]  or on tv they'll tell you're fortunate but people that have been known and they'll tell the police
[22:26.320 --> 22:33.840]  i don't know how i know all this i just know and it's the same thing you've got all this real data
[22:33.840 --> 22:42.560]  and then your conscious brain is a hundred times maybe more less powerful so the big brain the whole
[22:42.560 --> 22:48.720]  brain knows because it's got all the data points but your conscious mind is a narrow focal point of
[22:48.720 --> 22:54.640]  that and it's unable to understand why it knows it it just knows it there's just all this data
[22:54.640 --> 23:01.200]  coming in and and and you know it i'm getting chills right now now i attempted last night
[23:01.200 --> 23:07.360]  this morning to get together a bunch of documents and articles to lay out how i know all this because
[23:07.360 --> 23:13.440]  this isn't like what i did with 9 11 where it was next level
[23:15.920 --> 23:19.600]  where it was providence where it was you know the evidence was there but you know how could you
[23:19.600 --> 23:26.720]  extrapolate that to make a call that was so dead on it was just the spirit it was absolutely not
[23:26.720 --> 23:38.480]  just my brain it was god this is one percent or less as powerful as what i did in 2001 two months
[23:38.480 --> 23:42.720]  before on record anybody could type in alex jones predicts 9 11 too much before that's just a short
[23:42.720 --> 23:48.400]  clip it's online we fought to ever find that same show from the radio i did like two three hours
[23:48.400 --> 23:52.240]  laying it all out that day with precision a few clips of that have been found not the whole thing
[23:52.240 --> 23:57.680]  that was in july 25 26 that was when i was doing that i said call the white house tell them we know
[23:57.680 --> 24:01.760]  the deep state's gonna blow up the world trade centers they're gonna blame i mean i called the
[24:01.760 --> 24:05.520]  white house live on there and said i've seen the evidence they're gonna blow it up i mean this is
[24:05.520 --> 24:12.720]  this is not a joke i had the fbi call me uh the morning after uh morning after uh
[24:13.520 --> 24:19.920]  vegas and they said hey uh hostage rescue team individual through another individual that's
[24:19.920 --> 24:25.760]  worked with the cia and again i don't work with the cia i'm my own independent person but obviously
[24:25.760 --> 24:29.120]  there's a lot of people that have been in the cia and you know other things that that know me and
[24:29.120 --> 24:35.760]  then contact me and it's like well well how how does how did you say they're probably gonna attack a
[24:36.800 --> 24:45.120]  music venue or a rock concert at say 10 o'clock at night i said that at like 5 50 on the sunday show
[24:45.120 --> 24:49.520]  and the fbi paid attention and i said same way i called 9 11 they went okay yeah we don't think
[24:49.520 --> 24:53.840]  you're involved but man we want to know do you want to come work for us i mean how the hell do
[24:53.840 --> 25:00.400]  you do this i i don't know i just get in this place where i just start going off the data and i
[25:00.400 --> 25:05.840]  just start talking about things then i'll just say this is it this is it well that's that ether
[25:05.840 --> 25:13.600]  level that i don't know how i do it okay this thing with the virus is not that i'm getting
[25:13.600 --> 25:22.640]  that i'm getting chills right now this is all the evidence so this isn't a hunch this is
[25:24.560 --> 25:33.680]  absolutely documented and proven and enraged us me that it's so obvious and that we can't stop these
[25:33.680 --> 25:43.760]  people so i'll tell you what i'm gonna do i'm gonna shut up and i'm gonna let mike adams come on
[25:43.760 --> 25:51.840]  and have his say as i respect him and then we've got jose calisthen is it 12 30 correct
[25:54.240 --> 25:59.120]  so i'll have a couple segments before that and then dr steve pacinic and then my logon
[25:59.120 --> 26:07.440]  opolis and studio i'm doing all four hours a day and i'm gonna i think i just might let mike host
[26:07.440 --> 26:09.280]  those two segments because
[26:14.160 --> 26:20.000]  here here's the problem i can sit there and give you the data points of how i know this stuff
[26:20.000 --> 26:25.760]  and then that takes a long time and it also is very frustrating and then i never get to just the
[26:25.760 --> 26:30.960]  big enchilada what i'm telling you is going on but i think all of you already instinctively know
[26:30.960 --> 26:38.880]  this is the big one and if we fail this test we're going to be ruled by the threat of unending
[26:38.880 --> 26:45.360]  invisible bio weapons that the globalists are going to be releasing to take full control of
[26:45.360 --> 26:49.280]  society and we've known that's their mode of control for a long time and the globalists have
[26:49.280 --> 26:54.160]  bragged and all these different publications they're going to use the threat of mass mass
[26:54.160 --> 26:58.720]  pathogens and death to control we know all that it's obvious
[27:02.160 --> 27:09.200]  but if we don't get that narrative out you know on a mass scale we're screwed and i'll tell you
[27:09.200 --> 27:15.520]  the only person i see is a world leader that is not going along with this and that has fought it
[27:15.520 --> 27:21.680]  and who has saw through it is trump and believe me trump knows exactly what's going on and he's
[27:21.680 --> 27:25.840]  fighting the deep state on one side and the chai comms that are linked up with another side
[27:25.840 --> 27:30.480]  and they released us on purpose to clamp down their own people to end the taiwan embarrassment
[27:31.280 --> 27:35.120]  and then to try to topple our economy that's all admitted the democrats brag about that
[27:36.240 --> 27:40.080]  that in of itself is so huge but then you look at the virus
[27:40.080 --> 27:52.000]  it's pretty simple statement huh why aren't we talking about where this thing came from when
[27:52.000 --> 28:00.640]  it's known to be manmade and what it's mutated into as i said six weeks ago and that there's
[28:00.640 --> 28:08.880]  different strains why is it killing five percent in italy and only maybe half a percent here in the
[28:08.880 --> 28:14.240]  us and now they admit there's a bunch of different strains and then you look at where it keeps popping
[28:14.240 --> 28:26.720]  up it's where they had big military drills so this virus is a chimera because it mutates into
[28:26.720 --> 28:32.240]  different chimeras and there's been a bunch of different versions of it released and
[28:32.240 --> 28:38.640]  the globalists are testing right now our response to see if they can lock us down
[28:39.360 --> 28:44.640]  and then if we lock down properly then they're going to release the real bio version that'll
[28:44.640 --> 28:48.880]  then start wiping out even more so this is a test for the global depopulation operation
[28:49.680 --> 28:56.480]  it's 2020 and they're gearing up to exterminate you and your family it came out of wuhan

[33:39.840 --> 33:45.760]  a photo that was sent to me by one of my friends his dad on a cruise ship off the coast of south
[33:45.760 --> 33:52.320]  africa and in the little daily newspapers they hand out to every member of the you're visiting
[33:53.280 --> 34:02.320]  folks the tourists the cruisers their shipmates they have an article about alex jones
[34:03.680 --> 34:11.760]  arrested for twi there it is why would that be on a cruise ship out of south africa well
[34:11.760 --> 34:16.240]  well dr pacinics talked about this it is a state department operation since the end of world war
[34:16.240 --> 34:22.480]  two where certain communicates we put out through a system that is then published via operation
[34:22.480 --> 34:27.680]  mockingbirds what it's called in every newspaper in the world that's affiliated with it and every
[34:27.680 --> 34:33.440]  broadcast system that's why every tv station every radio station every network every newspaper
[34:33.440 --> 34:38.400]  that is part of these affiliate systems since the 40s just takes what is given to them and put out
[34:38.400 --> 34:47.120]  off course i blew under the legal limit but now they have a thing where they test you at the jail
[34:47.120 --> 34:52.720]  so i had to be taken to jail it's ridiculous two beers would do that to you i'm not ashamed of that
[34:52.720 --> 35:00.000]  whatever i've told people i drink sometimes it's about how i'm being targeted and why they're
[35:00.000 --> 35:06.560]  being targeted here's another example i've talked about on air the fact that hospitals have nano
[35:06.560 --> 35:12.080]  silver and colloidal silver and you go to the you go to cvs now they've got a whole section of silver
[35:12.640 --> 35:19.200]  everybody knows silver goes after viruses and goes after bacteria and then we sell different
[35:20.000 --> 35:26.400]  high-quality silver products by american nanotech that has gone out and has their stuff
[35:26.400 --> 35:30.800]  sold over the counter that we then private label and then the media thinks everybody's ignorant
[35:30.800 --> 35:35.680]  goes oh jones claims he can cure the corona virus no i never said that i never said if you had the
[35:35.680 --> 35:41.440]  virus replicating in you that this would this would fix it i said i personally gargle with it
[35:41.440 --> 35:45.920]  it knocks it out on contact and that's a good front line of defense and everyone knows that
[35:45.920 --> 35:51.280]  but so does elderberry i don't sell elderberry but i've told folks it's a good antiviral everybody
[35:51.280 --> 35:58.080]  knows that why wouldn't you tell people hey vitamin c is good for you hey vitamin d what's in fish oil
[35:59.600 --> 36:04.320]  but big pharma does not want people to because they're telling you oh there's no vaccine
[36:04.320 --> 36:09.520]  and so you're like well i better do something else to bolster my immune system just for general
[36:09.520 --> 36:13.120]  health in life so guess what it just so happened to come back in yesterday has been sold out for a

[36:27.280 --> 36:32.400]  having to post everyone's syndicating that i'm up here putting out a fraud this is the same stuff
[36:32.400 --> 36:37.600]  we put it out before them that walmart private labels and that walmart sells on their store shelves
[36:37.600 --> 36:45.200]  except ours has iodine in it and theirs doesn't and by the way we sell ours for less so it's like i'm
[36:46.640 --> 36:51.680]  selling toothpaste and saying it's good for your teeth that's supposedly bad that we have
[36:52.960 --> 36:58.720]  the toothpaste with the same nano silver in it with a tooth whitening toothpaste i mean i've been
[36:58.720 --> 37:03.040]  selling this toothpaste for six months i've been selling the other toothpaste that has
[37:03.760 --> 37:11.840]  colloidal silver iodine and tea tree for what four years but they're like oh no he just came fly by

[37:22.640 --> 37:27.920]  before this ever popped up we got our lawyers on it right now sending out season assist letters to
[37:27.920 --> 37:31.680]  the new york post and all the rest of them because they're because they're misrepresenting what i've
[37:31.680 --> 37:43.040]  said and oh dr kimshaw please this this is dr keith molar american biotech labs and then we've got

[38:21.280 --> 38:28.080]  not say you need water to live and then they and they always like oh they're saying that that
[38:28.080 --> 38:33.040]  jones has stuff not fda approved the fda doesn't make rulings and what they call supplements
[38:36.640 --> 38:40.640]  they only have a jurisdiction when they can claim you're saying you're a drug and i'm not
[38:40.640 --> 38:44.640]  saying when i eat an orange it's good for me and and it keeps me from getting scurvy that's a
[38:44.640 --> 38:50.560]  sign of a fact as a citizen i have a right to say that so we say eat your oranges eat your orange
[38:50.560 --> 38:56.000]  pills get your elderberry i personally take colloidal silver i take the types that are authorized to
[38:56.000 --> 39:02.480]  me take ingested and it's done a great job for me and everybody out there knows that as well
[39:02.480 --> 39:07.840]  and so this is just more of the attack alex jones more shut him down because they don't want you
[39:07.840 --> 39:13.440]  to hear people like mike adams on this broadcast mike adams who's been dead on with the fact that
[39:13.440 --> 39:17.520]  this was going to be a huge catastrophe they were going to shut down civilization whether the virus
[39:17.520 --> 39:28.160]  is super deadly or not this is huge this is absolutely huge this is seismic and they don't
[39:28.160 --> 39:35.120]  want us on air they want us arrested for using our free speech well america isn't gonna buy it
[39:35.120 --> 39:38.400]  and people aren't gonna put with it mike holds you a little bit in the next hour and then i'm
[39:38.400 --> 39:42.560]  gonna give my big take on this i mean we pretty much figured out what it is and what's going on but
[39:42.560 --> 39:47.600]  i think trump's change the trajectory now this announcement last night a pretty big deal so
[39:47.600 --> 39:51.680]  thanks for joining us mike out of general news dot com well absolutely trump has made a huge
[39:51.680 --> 39:56.000]  decision in the right direction he's taking a leadership role on this right now i think trump
[39:56.000 --> 40:00.480]  just saved his presidency frankly i was very concerned that he wasn't going to take this
[40:00.480 --> 40:05.040]  with the aggressiveness that he needed to but he but he did and he did that last night he changed
[40:05.040 --> 40:10.160]  the trajectory we fed the new numbers into our pandemic projection model and based on trump's
[40:10.160 --> 40:15.040]  decision to block flights from europe as well as governors and mayors across america blocking public
[40:15.040 --> 40:20.720]  events we now believe there is a 30 social distancing suppression factor which takes our
[40:20.720 --> 40:27.120]  number of projected deaths by july 4th in america down substantially from what was 1.1 million now
[40:27.120 --> 40:34.240]  to 283 thousand so in other words trump and other government officials who are are canceling public
[40:34.240 --> 40:39.200]  events they just saved 800 thousand american lives okay that's the kind of future that we're dealing
[40:39.200 --> 40:43.840]  with here and if they get more aggressive in the coming weeks which they will mark my words
[40:43.840 --> 40:49.760]  then the number of deaths can be even more reduced we might be able to to limit this to just a few
[40:49.760 --> 40:54.560]  thousand deaths by this summer if they get more and more aggressive but you know we'll have to see
[40:54.560 --> 40:59.840]  i think dr fouchi is correct it depends on how we respond to this virus we could end up with millions
[40:59.840 --> 41:04.640]  of americans dead if we did nothing or we could end up with only a few thousand dead if we get very
[41:04.640 --> 41:10.640]  aggressive with social distancing but on your comments on on silver and copper i just want to
[41:10.640 --> 41:16.160]  mention new research out there that talks about how long the corona virus survives on surfaces
[41:16.160 --> 41:21.920]  shows that on copper surfaces it's killed in hours whereas the the virus survives for many days
[41:21.920 --> 41:27.760]  up to nine days on other surfaces such as cardboard or plastic or others and silver is known to to
[41:27.760 --> 41:35.440]  kill the viability of viruses and kill bacteria even more aggressively than copper so my estimation
[41:35.440 --> 41:40.560]  as an elemental scientist i run a science lab we deal with elements all the time we run microbiology
[41:40.560 --> 41:47.760]  as well that silver would probably kill this virus on surfaces more quickly than copper so
[41:47.760 --> 41:52.800]  anyone saying that silver doesn't work against the corona virus is out of their minds or just
[41:52.800 --> 41:58.720]  illiterate when it comes to my uncle and my cousin and my dad's uncle were all from the same ranch
[41:58.720 --> 42:03.920]  all got the same respiratory thing six years ago and all died from christmas into new years
[42:03.920 --> 42:07.440]  they all died within about three weeks of each other i was in policy at the big hospital and
[42:07.440 --> 42:12.880]  they had silver spray bottles and stuff everywhere it's it's all that works down there just and the
[42:12.880 --> 42:16.880]  nurses are just lathering themselves and spraying silver everywhere they go the iodine isn't working
[42:16.880 --> 42:21.760]  anymore and this isn't working we just use this it's working i mean everybody knows that it's like
[42:21.760 --> 42:25.840]  a scientific yeah well studies have shown that hospitals could drastically reduce the number of
[42:25.840 --> 42:31.440]  superbug infections in hospitals if they just had copper doorknobs and copper surfaces throughout
[42:31.440 --> 42:37.680]  the hospital so yeah copper and silver kill bacteria and they denature viruses as well
[42:37.680 --> 42:42.000]  very very quickly that's that's widely known and documented across the medical community
[42:42.000 --> 42:48.320]  well regardless of how deadly it is the panics here tom hanks supposedly has it they canceled the
[42:48.320 --> 42:54.240]  mba trumps canceled planes from europe what what's trump gonna shut down next we know that's common
[42:54.240 --> 43:02.320]  stay with us rich in alabama rich thanks for calling hey mr johns appreciate it first thing

[44:05.680 --> 44:12.080]  globalist operation now whether it's super deadly or not the issue is it's being used by the globalist
[44:12.080 --> 44:17.360]  is a weapon against the world economy and against nation states and against the populist movement
[44:17.360 --> 44:22.720]  here in america and against info wars and that means against you so however you're going to do it

[45:36.320 --> 45:40.560]  at the mall on the hike and bike trail and they go oh alex i used to love you i wish you were still
[45:40.560 --> 45:44.080]  on air are you ever gonna go back on air and i'm like we're on hundreds of radio stations over a
[45:44.080 --> 45:47.520]  hundred tv stations and cable stations we have our own streams at info wars dot com and band
[45:47.520 --> 45:52.320]  on video and they go really they said you were off the air because they took the platforming as
[45:52.320 --> 46:00.000]  off the air no we have our own platform info wars info wars info wars we always promote being
[46:00.000 --> 46:05.440]  prepared having firearms knowing how to use them and be self-sufficient and learn how to hunt and
[46:05.440 --> 46:09.520]  learn how to garden i mean it's just it's what we're meant to do it feels good when we do it but we
[46:09.520 --> 46:14.480]  do sell high quality swarovl food i told my patriot a month ago i said what can you handle i said i
[46:14.480 --> 46:17.360]  think it's gonna be really big and they said we can handle probably this we're not sure we're
[46:17.360 --> 46:20.720]  investing everything we've got to even pay it forward to be able to fund it i said no i think
[46:20.720 --> 46:23.600]  this is gonna be huge i think you should spend everything you have coming in to secure more
[46:23.600 --> 46:26.800]  food even though the prices are going up for you so those are the top discussions we have i'm just
[46:26.800 --> 46:32.160]  giving the inside the baseball of all of us this is a hundred times regular volume plus was a hundred
[46:32.160 --> 46:37.360]  times a few days ago now it's about 200 times okay at info wars store dot com you go right in the queue
[46:37.360 --> 46:42.320]  where it's come first sir but the fact that the orders are so ultra massive it's dizzying i mean
[46:42.320 --> 46:47.360]  this is just insane we're expecting to have to put six to eight weeks to be safe and then if it
[46:47.360 --> 46:52.000]  continues like this we're looking at having tubes to spin food sauce but everybody gets their order
[46:52.000 --> 46:56.080]  in we'll get your food but that's how big this is so what you're getting is 100 the straight
[46:56.080 --> 47:12.000]  deal of what's going on info wars store dot com you're listening to the alex jones show
[47:14.800 --> 47:21.360]  over 20 years ago alex jones created the media platform called info wars and in the decade since
[47:21.360 --> 47:27.680]  it's grown into a truly remarkable institution with over 200 radio affiliates tens of millions of
[47:27.680 --> 47:33.360]  unique website visitors monthly and a 24 seven live news tv channel broadcasting from state of
[47:33.360 --> 47:38.880]  the art studios in austin texas info wars has become the most trusted independent news source
[47:38.880 --> 47:44.560]  in the country dedicated to delivering breaking news live coverage of special events and exclusive
[47:44.560 --> 47:50.640]  reports you won't find anywhere else while the old guard media struggles to maintain supremacy
[47:50.640 --> 47:56.320]  in a landscape brought by innovation and technology info wars has been at the forefront of the
[47:56.320 --> 48:02.800]  information revolution from eight million radio listeners over two million youtube subscribers
[48:02.800 --> 48:08.960]  or the billions of views of our online content info wars proves dominant in every facet of media
[48:08.960 --> 48:15.600]  we entered for the hardest-hitting reports uncompromising analysis for high-profile interviews
[48:15.600 --> 48:26.640]  and bombshell revelations except no substitutes demand truth demand info wars info wars tomorrow's
[48:26.640 --> 48:33.840]  news today and that's why they want us shut down ladies and gentlemen and that's a promo from like
[48:33.840 --> 48:39.280]  two years ago they're all over the news saying people that sell storeable food are bad people
[48:39.280 --> 48:43.840]  that have it are bad if you're a prep or you're bad but i have a whole stack of articles i'm
[48:43.840 --> 48:48.080]  going to get to the next hour where the billionaires most of them have run to underground bunkers
[48:50.080 --> 48:54.880]  with private airfields and their own private security forces that's all okay
[48:57.920 --> 49:04.320]  but if we say hey look at all these studies about nano silver colloidal silver and how the
[49:04.320 --> 49:09.920]  military uses it and how hospitals use it and how it's sold at the store when we say that we're bad
[49:09.920 --> 49:17.040]  because there's one thing that's going to save you that's vaccines but they don't even have a vaccine
[49:17.040 --> 49:22.400]  for and this thing's mutating just like the flu so when you take a vaccine for this one it doesn't
[49:22.400 --> 49:28.000]  cover it for that one and it's all a giant hoax and they don't want us here they don't want you
[49:28.000 --> 49:33.600]  here they don't want you to hear dr. Joel or dr. c patrinic coming on they don't want you to hear
[49:33.600 --> 49:39.600]  world the first brief editor and chief told scowls and they don't want you to hear any of these guys
[49:39.600 --> 49:45.040]  they don't want you here mike adams here they tell you there's no hope there's nothing but staying
[49:45.040 --> 49:50.160]  where you are and then if you try to boost your immune system you're a bad guy absolutely insane
[49:50.880 --> 49:56.240]  and just totally crazy mike adams continue with your projections of what's going to happen
[49:56.240 --> 50:01.280]  of what's going to unfold as you said you think trump saved his presidency by not letting them
[50:01.280 --> 50:05.200]  demonize him and say he had none enough but notice the democrats have come out incredibly
[50:05.200 --> 50:13.360]  and said that it's his fault now and that he should keep the borders open and let the flights
[50:13.360 --> 50:20.240]  continue to come in so the democrats can't have it both ways can they no they they want the president
[50:20.240 --> 50:25.840]  to be weak now now look there's something very important is happening right now today not only
[50:25.840 --> 50:30.960]  is the capital building now closed and evacuated because the senate staffer tested positive for
[50:30.960 --> 50:35.520]  the coronavirus so now we're starting to look at can our government function in the middle of this
[50:35.520 --> 50:42.480]  epidemic but also drudge has this headline the cdc only tested 77 patients during the entire week
[50:42.480 --> 50:48.560]  77 patients that's that's criminally negligent south korea tested tens of thousands of people
[50:48.560 --> 50:53.680]  this week italy tested thousands of people the u.s government tested 77 people that's that's
[50:53.680 --> 50:59.040]  absolutely unacceptable trump needs to clean house there but even bigger sacramento county
[50:59.040 --> 51:03.040]  has announced they're dropping all quarantines they're no longer going to try to contain this
[51:03.040 --> 51:07.360]  they're just releasing all high-risk patients right out to the public i've got a story on this
[51:07.360 --> 51:12.880]  right now up on my website just a few minutes ago i've called for trump to declare a national
[51:12.880 --> 51:20.720]  emergency and literally dispatched the military to take over sacramento county in order to re-establish
[51:20.720 --> 51:27.280]  basic medical principles of the modern era sacramento county is trying to spread this
[51:27.280 --> 51:33.440]  they're deliberately wanting to bring down trump by spreading the disease and spreading the infections
[51:33.440 --> 51:39.600]  it is a criminal sabotage act on the part of sacramento county they can't be that stupid they
[51:39.600 --> 51:45.360]  can't be that ignorant it's not complacency it is sabotage so you have the cdc trying to sabotage
[51:45.360 --> 51:51.040]  trump sacramento county again an anti-trump bunch of left-wing let me just interrupt you and then
[51:51.040 --> 51:55.120]  i want you to host another segment or two if you can just yourself so you can have the floor but
[51:55.120 --> 52:00.240]  let me ask this question when you sit there you say they're sabotaging you're not joking they're
[52:00.240 --> 52:04.160]  openly rooting for it to hurt people they're hoping it brings down the economy and the president
[52:04.160 --> 52:08.240]  they're hoping it kills the recovery when china was shooting people at checkpoints and closing
[52:08.240 --> 52:12.560]  borders and countries were banning flights from there it was wonderful we ban flights it's the
[52:12.560 --> 52:16.880]  worst thing ever then trump's not doing enough he bans flights from europe where it's running rampant
[52:16.880 --> 52:20.880]  and now he's the bad guy they have a bill and federal courts and they're gonna block it but then
[52:20.880 --> 52:26.640]  it's his fault not doing enough well trump needs to declare a national emergency and then just take
[52:26.640 --> 52:32.720]  the actions that are necessary and ignore the courts that are trying to block these necessary
[52:32.720 --> 52:38.640]  actions uh these these obama appointed federal judges need to be just well i totally agree with
[52:38.640 --> 52:44.720]  you but there's a hollywood big tech they're all concerted effort doing this i mean clearly this
[52:44.720 --> 52:49.440]  is the move against america this is it absolutely and and they've set a trap for trump as we've talked
[52:49.440 --> 52:53.840]  about for over a month well like it's uncanny how you and i and others laid out exactly what would
[52:53.840 --> 52:58.800]  happen what they would do next just knowing their mentality and that it's man-made well and if you
[52:58.800 --> 53:04.160]  want to know what's coming next trump will have to ban certain domestic uh flight paths so flights
[53:04.160 --> 53:09.600]  out of seattle will probably be banned i i expect the seattle airport will be quarantined and shut
[53:09.600 --> 53:14.480]  down uh very very soon perhaps within a week and then that will happen in northern california
[53:14.480 --> 53:19.680]  boston massachusetts and new york city as well in subsequent weeks that's that's a very likely type
[53:19.680 --> 53:25.680]  of behavior i do expect trump to increase the the military deployment on the southern border
[53:25.680 --> 53:30.160]  in order to block illegals who are carrying infections into sanctuary cities especially
[53:30.160 --> 53:36.080]  but there's another big factor in all this alex and this is a question do mosquitoes carry this
[53:36.080 --> 53:40.800]  blood-borne disease in other words in the summer in america will mosquitoes spread this like
[53:40.800 --> 53:46.800]  mosquitoes spread malaria mosquitoes currently spread 200 plus diseases that are blood-borne
[53:46.800 --> 53:51.360]  when mosquitoes bite you they actually suck some of your blood and then they inject a little bit of
[53:51.360 --> 53:58.240]  that blood into the other person that's that's how malaria spreads now malaria is not a virus of
[53:58.240 --> 54:05.760]  course but viruses are present in blood and much smaller than bacteria so can mosquitoes spread this
[54:05.760 --> 54:11.440]  we don't know the answer to that yet but if they do spread it then our world is in trouble and by
[54:11.440 --> 54:16.400]  the way it's not going away just when the summer comes because australia is in hot weather right
[54:16.400 --> 54:21.520]  now and in australia this is spreading like mad so hot weather doesn't shut this thing down that's
[54:21.520 --> 54:26.000]  that's crucial for us to understand we're gonna have to deal with this all summer uh probably for
[54:26.000 --> 54:30.240]  years to come and by the way we've been told by the media going back six weeks don't try to block
[54:30.240 --> 54:37.040]  chinese don't be racist well i mean it doesn't matter whether they're chinese or russian or from
[54:37.040 --> 54:42.160]  africa or wherever if the disease is a place and it's that group what did idli have a bunch of
[54:42.160 --> 54:48.080]  chinese workers in malan and other areas that were doing all the fancy shoes and all the clothing
[54:48.640 --> 54:55.200]  and others that's admitted a huge imported chinese worker population same thing that we see in the
[54:55.200 --> 55:00.320]  mines and in a bunch of other things where china owns most of the mines in australia and has all
[55:00.320 --> 55:04.560]  sorts of facilities there and is built like its own enclaves well that's where you see the hot spot
[55:04.560 --> 55:10.400]  so clearly china incubated this and then deployed it worldwide well absolutely and they're not done
[55:10.400 --> 55:16.480]  this is just the first wave so you you hinted at this earlier this is a softening up phase for america
[55:16.480 --> 55:22.320]  there is a much more virulent strain that will be released and i believe that idli has just
[55:22.320 --> 55:28.080]  experienced a natural mutation that's made it more deadly there america doesn't probably have
[55:28.080 --> 55:33.120]  that mutation yet but it may happen on its own or we're going to get hit with a second wave of this
[55:33.120 --> 55:39.360]  so this is nowhere near over china's hoping that america collapses in terms of its infrastructure
[55:39.360 --> 55:44.800]  its hospitals and its stock market and also executive power i.e. the president and once
[55:44.800 --> 55:51.120]  that happens china will unleash even more attacks possibly in a worst-case scenario an actual
[55:51.120 --> 55:57.920]  invasion of america via california that's that's a scenario that we have to take as realistic although
[55:57.920 --> 56:02.080]  it's it's pretty far down the road things have to get very bad before they would even attempt that
[56:02.880 --> 56:06.640]  so so it's good news that trump has started to take a leadership position on this
[56:06.640 --> 56:10.320]  and he's getting a handle on this and he's he's starting to move in the right direction
[56:10.320 --> 56:14.560]  and that's that's exactly what we need to see happen by by cracking down
[56:14.560 --> 56:19.120]  on the social sharing of the virus trump is defeating the deep state and defeating the
[56:19.120 --> 56:24.640]  leftist and saving his presidency and allowing i agree my the only way i'm going to let you talk is
[56:24.640 --> 56:28.720]  if i let you host the next two segments if you got to go understand but how about you just come in
[56:28.720 --> 56:33.520]  and host the first segment and then part of the next introduction just get other parts you want
[56:33.520 --> 56:37.280]  and i'm going to be here listening and then i'm going to get into what i've projected is really
[56:37.280 --> 56:42.880]  going on and now i i i agree with you this is as bad as it's going to get and that it's an opening
[56:42.880 --> 56:47.120]  salvo over larger role at it really all crystallized for me doing deep research last night this morning
[56:47.120 --> 56:51.280]  and talking to you and i think you just picked up where i was going without me even telling you
[56:51.280 --> 56:55.680]  i think you're starting to concur with me as we as we brainstorm here that this is a opening
[56:55.680 --> 57:00.880]  salvo and something much larger absolutely it is there's no question and and it depends on how
[57:00.880 --> 57:05.840]  trump responds to this of the readiness of america for dealing with the the senate this is a probe
[57:05.840 --> 57:10.160]  this is a test talk about that when you come back everybody they're trying to shut us down you see
[57:10.160 --> 57:15.120]  it everywhere the demonization the attacks the lies the propaganda you can't believe any of it
[57:15.120 --> 57:18.800]  almost all of it's pure bull that's why they're attacking me because they want they don't want

[59:44.960 --> 1:00:00.880]  about band on video and info wars dot com today you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:00:00.880 --> 1:00:19.040]  info wars tomorrow's news today all right we are continuing here let me let me give you a quick
[1:00:19.040 --> 1:00:25.520]  breakdown of really what's happening in sacramento county especially to try to spread this virus
[1:00:25.520 --> 1:00:31.680]  across america as a way to politically hurt trump so if you can bring up that story it's a press
[1:00:31.680 --> 1:00:37.680]  release from sacramento county from march ninth and in that press release the county says that
[1:00:37.680 --> 1:00:45.120]  in in their shift from containment to mitigation they're no longer going to have any quarantines
[1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:50.880]  and they're no longer even testing people who are in high-risk groups so what we have here now
[1:00:50.880 --> 1:00:55.920]  even though the county admits that there are only 10 confirmed infections in the entire county
[1:00:55.920 --> 1:01:03.280]  what we actually have is a a deliberate surrender to the virus on purpose in order to allow it to
[1:01:03.280 --> 1:01:09.200]  spread in california now if you are listening to this and you live in sacramento county you
[1:01:09.200 --> 1:01:16.960]  should call your officials in that county you should demand their arrest or or demand they
[1:01:16.960 --> 1:01:23.600]  reverse this i'm calling for trump to deploy the military to take control of sacramento county
[1:01:23.600 --> 1:01:28.880]  and as we heard with stewart roads yesterday the military's role in this should be to protect
[1:01:28.880 --> 1:01:34.720]  public health set up hospital triage units for the surge of cases that's coming especially
[1:01:34.720 --> 1:01:40.400]  in places like central and northern california so we're not talking about military enforcing
[1:01:40.400 --> 1:01:44.960]  quarantines at gunpoint and locking people in their homes we're talking about the military
[1:01:44.960 --> 1:01:53.120]  supporting testing which is necessary and then helping maintain quarantines of
[1:01:53.120 --> 1:01:58.160]  high-risk individuals for a reasonable amount of time to make sure that this does not spread
[1:01:58.160 --> 1:02:03.760]  that is how south korea successfully has shut this thing down it's how taiwan shut it down it's
[1:02:03.760 --> 1:02:09.680]  how singapore shut it down and the reason you have over what 12 000 infections in italy and the
[1:02:09.680 --> 1:02:15.040]  hospitals overrun almost to the point of total collapse the collapse of italy is now threatened
[1:02:15.040 --> 1:02:21.120]  why because they acted too late they did not do the early things that singapore did and south
[1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:28.560]  korea did and taiwan did and even hong kong by the way and when you have a county in california
[1:02:28.560 --> 1:02:35.120]  sacramento county deliberately engaging in criminal sabotage to spread this virus across america
[1:02:35.120 --> 1:02:41.440]  then it is absolutely time for president trump to declare a national emergency send the military
[1:02:41.440 --> 1:02:47.200]  into sacramento county seize control of the public health department there arrest the officials
[1:02:47.200 --> 1:02:54.640]  march them out prosecute them put them in jail and reestablish basic modern medical common sense
[1:02:54.640 --> 1:03:00.480]  that's exactly what i'm calling for you can quote me on that it has to be done you cannot allow these
[1:03:00.480 --> 1:03:06.480]  radical left-wing anti trump lunatics in california to sacrifice the health of their own citizens
[1:03:06.480 --> 1:03:11.600]  in their effort to spread the panic and spread the disease and try to create an economic collapse
[1:03:11.600 --> 1:03:16.320]  and it's long past time anybody's still saying this is just the flu you don't know what you're
[1:03:16.320 --> 1:03:20.880]  talking about trump has got to get serious he's already started to do that he now needs to declare
[1:03:20.880 --> 1:03:26.320]  a national emergency and he needs to make it very clear any counties that are going to try to sabotage
[1:03:26.320 --> 1:03:34.240]  the nation are going to be seized by the military that is what must be done in america right now
[1:03:34.240 --> 1:03:40.080]  now fortunately here in texas we have a governor who understands all this our governor in texas
[1:03:40.080 --> 1:03:44.640]  will work to protect the people and there are governors even democrat governors such as governor
[1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:50.080]  inslee in washington state who also can do the math he seems to understand exactly what's happening
[1:03:50.080 --> 1:03:55.600]  he's prepared to issue a statewide lockdown in washington state it sounds like very soon i'm
[1:03:55.600 --> 1:04:01.120]  predicting a closure of the seattle airport in the not too distant future and possibly some
[1:04:01.120 --> 1:04:07.840]  quarantine lockdown measures involving seattle and surrounding areas in washington state the more
[1:04:07.840 --> 1:04:12.560]  we achieve what's called social distancing suppression factors the fewer deaths we will
[1:04:12.560 --> 1:04:17.680]  have this summer and the more successful our national health care system will be in responding
[1:04:17.680 --> 1:04:22.560]  to this you have to control the number of infections and deaths reduce that number to a
[1:04:22.560 --> 1:04:27.520]  manageable level because if the hospitals get overrun then the mortality rate skyrockets to 10
[1:04:27.520 --> 1:04:33.600]  to 15 especially among the elderly so that's a wrap up of where we are right now in america
[1:04:33.600 --> 1:04:38.880]  i know a lot of great guests are coming up next on the show i'm going to be i believe hosting for

[1:04:45.360 --> 1:04:50.720]  vicious disease that trump is now trying to beat while saving his presidency and saving our nation

[1:06:09.440 --> 1:06:13.680]  so by now of course you know that tom hanks and his wife were reportedly
[1:06:13.680 --> 1:06:19.200]  diagnosed with coronavirus and are currently in isolation in a hospital in australia now of course
[1:06:19.200 --> 1:06:28.240]  with some conjecture that maybe tom hanks some say might be faking it in order to spread panic or
[1:06:28.240 --> 1:06:35.440]  fear about the virus personally i don't think that tom hanks would lie about this thing this this
[1:06:35.440 --> 1:06:41.040]  epidemic my belief is that because tom hanks you know he shakes a lot of hands he's a very visible
[1:06:41.040 --> 1:06:46.320]  figure he was working on a movie set reportedly in australia and australia has an uncontained
[1:06:46.320 --> 1:06:52.480]  outbreak situation happening there so tom hanks is actually the kind of person with a kind of social
[1:06:52.480 --> 1:06:58.080]  interaction that would be exposed to this just like frankly president trump is as well in members
[1:06:58.080 --> 1:07:05.520]  of congress who are running for office and we've seen members of the government in iran die because
[1:07:05.520 --> 1:07:11.280]  of this virus and and large numbers of people all of the world health officials in europe
[1:07:11.280 --> 1:07:17.520]  have been diagnosed with a virus so i don't think i mean my guess is tom hanks isn't making it up but
[1:07:17.520 --> 1:07:23.040]  it's possible i admit it's possible my guess is that he's really got it but he will beat it because
[1:07:23.040 --> 1:07:29.680]  he'll get of course very good health care tom hanks maybe he's aware of antiviral nutraceuticals
[1:07:29.680 --> 1:07:34.800]  he's probably demanding intravenous vitamin c therapy right now that's what i would be doing
[1:07:34.800 --> 1:07:40.000]  if i were diagnosed i would immediately call up some of my friends in alternative medicine and say
[1:07:40.000 --> 1:07:47.440]  look hit me with 50 000 milligrams of vitamin c and that would be a great treatment you know and it
[1:07:47.440 --> 1:07:52.640]  would it would probably have a very good effect in fact china is now running multiple clinical
[1:07:52.640 --> 1:07:58.640]  trials looking at the effects of vitamin c intravenously in order to stop this virus and actually
[1:07:58.640 --> 1:08:03.040]  treat it so it's going to be interesting to watch how that goes now understand that intravenous
[1:08:03.040 --> 1:08:09.840]  vitamin c treatment is very different from oral consumption orally it's very hard to get even 20
[1:08:09.840 --> 1:08:14.640]  000 milligrams without experiencing you know typically loose stools or something like that
[1:08:14.640 --> 1:08:20.240]  your digestive tract can't handle that much but intravenously some some doctors or alternative
[1:08:20.240 --> 1:08:27.200]  naturopaths will give you 50 000 milligrams which is 50 grams or even 75 grams or in some cases even
[1:08:27.200 --> 1:08:32.320]  100 grams so my guess is if you combine that and this is a very important message that i think
[1:08:32.320 --> 1:08:37.200]  trump needs to get out there you know there are things that people can do right now that involve
[1:08:37.200 --> 1:08:42.800]  vitamin c and vitamin d3 i mean gary haven yesterday mentioned magnesium and zinc as well
[1:08:42.800 --> 1:08:47.360]  you know alex mentioned elderberry there are many things that can be done right now you could
[1:08:47.360 --> 1:08:51.280]  change your diet you could save your life you could start eating healthier and maybe stop the
[1:08:51.280 --> 1:08:56.240]  spread from someone else you know a lot of the strategies here it's about breaking the cycle
[1:08:56.240 --> 1:09:01.280]  of the exponential spread so there are really only two ways to do that right now number one
[1:09:01.280 --> 1:09:07.280]  is social distancing you stay home you stop going to social events secondly is antiviral
[1:09:07.280 --> 1:09:12.720]  nutraceuticals vitamins minerals supplements things that work herbs that work and there are
[1:09:12.720 --> 1:09:16.800]  lots of those out there in the marketplace and i've just mentioned some of them there are many
[1:09:16.800 --> 1:09:26.560]  more being studied as well and you know this nobody really has to be in even a 2% risk for this
[1:09:26.560 --> 1:09:32.000]  i believe you could get your personal risk down to 0.1% which is about the same as the seasonal
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:37.440]  flu just by relying on nutraceuticals now we can't prove it yet we don't have the the scientific
[1:09:37.440 --> 1:09:43.200]  data yet because it's so early in this but then again there's no vaccine there's no pharmaceutical
[1:09:43.200 --> 1:09:48.320]  so what's the harm in boosting your immune function right what's the harm in taking vitamin
[1:09:48.320 --> 1:09:53.920]  c there's no harm at all there's no downside to it it's safe it's affordable it's effective
[1:09:53.920 --> 1:09:58.880]  it boosts immune function in many ways that can help protect you against many many things
[1:09:58.880 --> 1:10:04.000]  and typically many of these supplements reduce inflammation so when we look at the mechanisms
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:09.920]  of coronavirus at how it increases inflammation dramatically especially in lung tissue actually
[1:10:09.920 --> 1:10:14.720]  scarring lung tissue then you need to look at what you're eating and what you're taking are you
[1:10:14.720 --> 1:10:21.680]  eating a highly pro inflammatory diet of fried foods and junk foods and soda and smoking cigarettes
[1:10:21.680 --> 1:10:27.600]  or things like that all of those things can become very serious even deadly risk factors
[1:10:28.320 --> 1:10:33.360]  if you are subjected to this infection so if you ever needed an excuse you know to clean up your
[1:10:33.360 --> 1:10:40.320]  diet and eat healthier and turn to nutraceuticals as a a good frontline defense mechanism boost your
[1:10:40.320 --> 1:10:45.600]  immune function this is a good time to do it and i find it fascinating that people on the left
[1:10:45.600 --> 1:10:49.920]  they normally want to promote natural health and natural medicine but now suddenly when the
[1:10:49.920 --> 1:10:54.480]  corona virus is out there they say oh it's bad to talk about boosting immune function it's bad to
[1:10:54.480 --> 1:10:59.920]  be healthy it's bad to be buying a hand sanitizer they're they're insane and by the way wasn't the
[1:10:59.920 --> 1:11:05.520]  mainstream media telling us this whole time before all this oh everybody should buy more stuff buy
[1:11:05.520 --> 1:11:09.920]  more stuff it's good for the economy remember president bush is like buy more stuff to help the
[1:11:09.920 --> 1:11:14.640]  economy so we're always told to buy more stuff but then suddenly when there's a virus it's like
[1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:20.720]  stop buying stuff what what where does that come from i thought you told us to buy more stuff now
[1:11:20.720 --> 1:11:26.320]  it's not don't don't buy stuff don't buy masks don't buy food don't buy hand sanitizer are you
[1:11:26.320 --> 1:11:32.480]  kidding me so i guess the advice is you're supposed to buy more stuff but only when you're not
[1:11:33.120 --> 1:11:39.680]  panicked if you have fear it's not okay to buy stuff but if you don't have fear what's it's
[1:11:39.680 --> 1:11:43.280]  perfectly great to buy stuff well then what about all the pharmaceutical advertising because that's
[1:11:43.280 --> 1:11:47.200]  all fear-based you know they say oh you're going to die from cancer in six months unless you take
[1:11:47.200 --> 1:11:52.240]  this chemotherapy you know the oncologist tells you that's fear-based decision-making at the cancer
[1:11:52.240 --> 1:11:57.680]  clinic media never attacks that do they even though chemotherapy the number one side effect is more
[1:11:57.680 --> 1:12:03.600]  cancer by the way chemotherapy kills more people than cancer so if you didn't know that you know
[1:12:03.600 --> 1:12:08.320]  do your research because chemotherapy is more deadly than cancer but they don't say that they
[1:12:08.320 --> 1:12:12.640]  don't admit that they say people died from the cancer when they really died from the chemotherapy
[1:12:12.640 --> 1:12:17.680]  all right my condoms you have done a great job i'm glad you hosted a few segments so i wouldn't be
[1:12:18.320 --> 1:12:25.520]  interrupting here i expect the president to start restricting more foreign flights and i expect
[1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:28.560]  some announcements on the northern and southern border particularly the southern it's the most
[1:12:28.560 --> 1:12:33.200]  porous uh when do you think he's going to make some of those announcements well i would think
[1:12:33.200 --> 1:12:37.360]  that within the next 10 days for sure he'll start getting real serious about domestic flight
[1:12:37.360 --> 1:12:41.440]  restrictions about the border because it's a very politically charged issue i don't know
[1:12:41.440 --> 1:12:45.920]  when that will happen but it needs to happen now and trump needs to deploy the military and just
[1:12:45.920 --> 1:12:52.000]  ignore the the the critics on that just do it deploy the military protect the border stop the
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:58.080]  infections from walking in my great job natural is dot com thank you sir thank you and i already
[1:12:58.080 --> 1:13:03.120]  mentioned this but i'm going to go over this again trump bans travel from europe for 30 days
[1:13:04.400 --> 1:13:08.480]  really he just called for more intensive screening democrats want to reverse trump's travel bans
[1:13:08.480 --> 1:13:14.640]  despite corona virus spread and then they call that racist you cannot make it up corona virus
[1:13:14.640 --> 1:13:23.600]  travel ban eurocrat complains europe is trump scapegoat slams nationalism unbelievable those
[1:13:23.600 --> 1:13:29.440]  articles are up on info wars dot com jim acosta complaints trump xenophobia for calling corona
[1:13:29.440 --> 1:13:39.680]  19 a foreign virus aoc says people aren't going to chinese restaurants due to racism around the
[1:13:39.680 --> 1:13:47.120]  corona virus really i was in a japanese restaurant through the night so this is the type of garbage
[1:13:48.080 --> 1:13:52.000]  that's going on meanwhile corona virus is 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu
[1:13:52.000 --> 1:13:59.840]  trump task force immunologist says but the notice the lethality keeps going down i'm still
[1:13:59.840 --> 1:14:04.320]  saying it's a serious virus you don't want it it's man-made and it's mutating and i haven't gotten
[1:14:04.320 --> 1:14:08.960]  to my big prime projection all that on all this and i'm going to do that when we come back in the
[1:14:08.960 --> 1:14:16.960]  next segment ahead of joel scousen separately i'm very very proud of the super silver immune

[1:20:26.960 --> 1:20:31.280]  the entire western world is starting to shut down as authorities brace for millions of
[1:20:31.280 --> 1:20:40.800]  coronavirus cases in the u.s. alone it's an amazing time to be alive yes the globalists
[1:20:40.800 --> 1:20:47.760]  are making their move against america against trump yes hollywood and big tech and the nba are all
[1:20:47.760 --> 1:20:54.480]  canceling events to create the biggest amount of hysteria they can to then try to hurt the economy
[1:20:55.200 --> 1:21:02.560]  the question is still open how deadly is this virus well here's what we know and we've chronicled
[1:21:02.560 --> 1:21:08.800]  this with the author of the u.s. biological weapons law that became world law and an unscientist
[1:21:08.800 --> 1:21:15.840]  and researchers at nauseam with the actual research papers out of india and other major
[1:21:16.400 --> 1:21:24.160]  prestigious universities around the world that the corona virus is a ridiculously man-made virus
[1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:31.840]  a chimera with a bunch of different families of viruses spliced together with an hiv delivery system
[1:21:31.840 --> 1:21:43.520]  welled it on to it as well not hiv but the hiv virus delivery system and it's a tiny virus
[1:21:44.080 --> 1:21:49.520]  it's very very sophisticated and it is killing people but from day one the communist china
[1:21:49.520 --> 1:21:54.640]  lockdown people being bored up in their houses the checkpoint people being shot in the head
[1:21:54.640 --> 1:22:02.320]  the media praised it and day one six weeks ago corporate media praised china but when trump
[1:22:02.320 --> 1:22:05.760]  talked about stopping flights and we said yeah that's a great idea they went oh my god it's so
[1:22:05.760 --> 1:22:14.240]  xenophobic then a week later south korea japan russia all these other stopped flights when trump
[1:22:14.240 --> 1:22:19.760]  did it a week later they freaked out in the media and said it was pure evil so did china so did the
[1:22:19.760 --> 1:22:26.000]  un the un's response shooting people at checkpoints was good trump saying we're gonna stop flights from
[1:22:26.000 --> 1:22:31.760]  china when everybody else had bad and that's when you see the agenda man-made virus so they can
[1:22:31.760 --> 1:22:36.720]  release it they've already tested it in the lab they know hell in china they've even got human
[1:22:36.720 --> 1:22:42.800]  prisoners they know how it's gonna be replicated on human test subjects not just rats and pigs and
[1:22:42.800 --> 1:22:51.920]  bats that also can get it and so you pull back from it and you watch all the different ways it's
[1:22:51.920 --> 1:23:00.400]  connected it's clear there are already first two then four now ten different strains some
[1:23:00.400 --> 1:23:07.120]  strains are more deadly than others it's mutating very quickly and it's a chimera so that it's got
[1:23:07.120 --> 1:23:14.640]  a whole family of families connected together so that it's very hard to track where it came from
[1:23:15.680 --> 1:23:21.040]  you have the original virus bought in 2015 from north carolina university that obama allowed
[1:23:21.040 --> 1:23:25.920]  the transfer of that was a big national controversy and then once they had that chimera they were able
[1:23:25.920 --> 1:23:30.720]  to get a functioning chimera very hard to build a virus like that they could then be modified further
[1:23:30.720 --> 1:23:39.520]  and so now we know what's happening it's spreading quickly they're using it to paralyze the economy
[1:23:39.520 --> 1:23:46.160]  they're creating hysteria like fear this is the globalist plan to teach us to live under lockdown
[1:23:46.160 --> 1:23:49.760]  to teach us that there's this invisible enemy even worse than terrorists that we've got to
[1:23:49.760 --> 1:23:55.600]  give our rights up and take the force inoculations and do what they say shut down the taiwanese
[1:23:55.600 --> 1:24:01.040]  protest shut down the chinese that were were revolting change the subject from the chinese trade
[1:24:01.040 --> 1:24:08.400]  war they lost it's clear they're now telling us it's going to mutate for years and oh don't worry
[1:24:08.400 --> 1:24:13.360]  a few years from now when it's really bad we'll have a vaccine but it'll always be a new mutation
[1:24:13.360 --> 1:24:21.760]  so when you pull back from this it's clear
[1:24:24.640 --> 1:24:29.520]  this is the year 2020 and the un and the bill deberg group and the debauchess group always said
[1:24:29.520 --> 1:24:37.920]  we will use bio weapon events and plagues to bring in world government and have control
[1:24:37.920 --> 1:24:41.440]  and that's how you make countries coordinate with each other let's say create international
[1:24:41.440 --> 1:24:47.440]  bodies that control it who will then be your saviors and will also be your jailers while they
[1:24:47.440 --> 1:24:53.760]  take control of your life and then this virus is a chimera so there's so many variants of it
[1:24:53.760 --> 1:24:58.640]  others can be slipped out whenever they want that are designed to target certain groups
[1:25:00.000 --> 1:25:04.240]  and so one gets released here that targets a group and other gets released there but they've
[1:25:04.240 --> 1:25:10.000]  tested them in the laboratory knowing they'll only kill for so long and then mutate into a harmless
[1:25:10.000 --> 1:25:17.360]  or less lethal version so that it just muddies the waters of the providence or the fingerprints
[1:25:17.360 --> 1:25:22.720]  the signature of the virus so that now there's a whole new family of chimeras out there that the
[1:25:22.720 --> 1:25:29.280]  globalists can experiment on us with the lethality the spreadability but also
[1:25:33.280 --> 1:25:38.240]  they can then even create race specific weapons down now to an individual person
[1:25:38.240 --> 1:25:44.080]  and use this as the ultimate assassination weapon where you can release this in a general area
[1:25:44.080 --> 1:25:50.000]  knowing it's going to take out a particular person or group of people it'll then mutate into a harmless
[1:25:50.000 --> 1:25:55.840]  form and you've got the ultimate nanotech weapon because that's what a designer virus is at the
[1:25:55.840 --> 1:26:01.440]  microscopic level spliced together with others programmed and then pre-tested how it's going
[1:26:01.440 --> 1:26:08.720]  to mutate you have the ultimate 21st century weapon that'll create the fear the hysteria
[1:26:08.720 --> 1:26:13.440]  and have people begging and pleading do whatever it takes just protect me from a virus that probably
[1:26:13.440 --> 1:26:19.680]  kills one half of 1% still worse than the flu notice it was 15% they thought and then it was
[1:26:19.680 --> 1:26:26.080]  5% and then that was 2% and now the White House is saying it's 10 times stronger than the flu so
[1:26:26.080 --> 1:26:37.120]  maybe 1% but regardless it's still big because it's the main globalist thrust and that's what I
[1:26:37.120 --> 1:26:42.480]  wanted to just get out here today that the system doesn't want you to be prepared they don't want
[1:26:42.480 --> 1:26:46.560]  you to be healthy they don't want you to be ready they don't want you to be informed and they don't
[1:26:46.560 --> 1:26:52.080]  want you to question the way to take this down it's a man-made virus that came out you can just
[1:26:52.080 --> 1:26:58.560]  say it's a man-made virus then they show the evidence in big papers how it was done and how
[1:26:58.560 --> 1:27:04.320]  it was spliced in and then the UN criticized them so they withdrew it but but not for reasons they
[1:27:04.320 --> 1:27:13.520]  said under pressure and then another university came out and said the same thing mainline journals
[1:27:13.520 --> 1:27:19.520]  are saying looks like it's man-made and now there's headlines in Politico the New York Times oh the
[1:27:19.520 --> 1:27:26.640]  conspiracy theorist in Russia and China and Brazil and Mexico they're all saying it's man-made and
[1:27:26.640 --> 1:27:31.200]  then their scientists come out and go yeah we looked at it under an electron microscope and you
[1:27:31.200 --> 1:27:35.760]  can see because it's so small they haven't learned how to slice stuff together that small it isn't
[1:27:35.760 --> 1:27:41.440]  obvious I mean a pizza's been cut up you see the pieces you see the pieces it's all it's it's it's
[1:27:41.440 --> 1:27:47.440]  it's a blob and it's all been slapped together it's the microscopic level it doesn't just come
[1:27:47.440 --> 1:27:52.880]  together sweetly it's a big slap together you know thing that was then miniaturized so it could
[1:27:52.880 --> 1:27:58.480]  be airborne so it could get into your lungs every part of it made so that it would spread
[1:27:59.360 --> 1:28:04.480]  so that everybody would end up learning they'd been infected with it so the hysteria will reach
[1:28:04.480 --> 1:28:10.240]  fever pitch once the test kits get out and that's why Trump says oh it's no problem no big deal
[1:28:11.200 --> 1:28:14.800]  and then oh we'll put the test kits out and then they don't put the test kits out because the
[1:28:14.800 --> 1:28:22.080]  White House knows an earlier non-lethal version was put out a later more lethal version was put out
[1:28:22.080 --> 1:28:26.640]  and then some super versions that they know retrograde and break down and mutate into harmless
[1:28:26.640 --> 1:28:32.000]  were put out to create high death rates in small pockets as the test you can put it all together
[1:28:32.000 --> 1:28:35.760]  and integrate the information with tens of thousands of other data points but that's it
[1:28:35.760 --> 1:28:40.320]  it's artificial it's the deep state working with the chai comms to launch this to bring in global

[1:33:16.960 --> 1:33:22.080]  him on the broadcast a lot he's a former marine court officer enable aviator vietnam era
[1:33:22.080 --> 1:33:31.760]  and one of the top experts on the global listener larger plan and i'm your host alex jones we just
[1:33:31.760 --> 1:33:36.000]  tuned in people always that's why i say my name is heartless segment radio stations go off ratings
[1:33:36.000 --> 1:33:39.680]  and sort of tv stations you've got to say who you are the name of the show coming in i'm i don't
[1:33:39.680 --> 1:33:43.440]  want to just alex jones alex jones that's how people though know what show they're tuned into
[1:33:43.440 --> 1:33:48.960]  he is the editor in chief of world affairs brief.com i'm with info wars.com and news wars.com
[1:33:48.960 --> 1:33:55.040]  and you notice i'm being super demonized right now everywhere they claim that i'm selling toothpaste
[1:33:55.040 --> 1:34:01.360]  that i say will cure you of the coronavirus never said that we have a company that makes it out of
[1:34:01.360 --> 1:34:06.880]  colorada that has certified that it takes out viruses in general and in that same family of
[1:34:06.880 --> 1:34:12.080]  corona not this corona but it's the same deal i sell the toothpaste as a tooth whitening toothpaste
[1:34:12.080 --> 1:34:18.400]  with nano silver so it's all over the news uh you're hoping i get arrested or something it's
[1:34:18.400 --> 1:34:25.760]  it's just it's just absolutely crazy that that goes on the immune gargle the same nano silver
[1:34:25.760 --> 1:34:30.240]  that's so good for your body so good for your mouth it's back in stock we also have the
[1:34:31.040 --> 1:34:34.320]  living defense that's so popular after almost five months sold out that's back in stock and
[1:34:34.320 --> 1:34:37.440]  that's how you fund the operation these are great products they're demonizing people that have
[1:34:37.440 --> 1:34:42.960]  storable foods uh and even saying that's bad so i'm gonna stop right there but i want to just
[1:34:42.960 --> 1:34:48.320]  just have those cows him take over this segment and the next i mean i'll be here i'll take him
[1:34:48.320 --> 1:34:53.040]  in on the brakes because i want him to be able to really flow with what he thinks is most important
[1:34:53.040 --> 1:34:58.000]  and what he thinks is coming next he's thought this is quite serious as well just like my Adams
[1:34:58.000 --> 1:35:03.600]  obviously they're using it to implode the economy but they've shown themselves now saying china did
[1:35:03.600 --> 1:35:08.240]  good shooting people at checkpoints and welding them into homes and russia did good in south korea
[1:35:08.240 --> 1:35:13.120]  blocking flies but when trump did he was bad later and now saying oh they have a bill introduced
[1:35:13.120 --> 1:35:18.240]  the democrats doing federal judges say they're preparing to block trump stopping unchecked
[1:35:18.240 --> 1:35:21.920]  flights and all this means you have to have a medical checkup first from europe so i think
[1:35:21.920 --> 1:35:26.000]  they really reveal themselves but instead of me taking joel scowl's end of world affairs brief
[1:35:26.000 --> 1:35:31.040]  dot com editor in chief there down my roads let's let him host the next two segments joel thanks
[1:35:31.040 --> 1:35:36.480]  for being here and please give us your expertise on this well thank you alex it's good to be with
[1:35:36.480 --> 1:35:43.760]  you again um let me compare in my my assessment of the coronavirus is actually that it's less
[1:35:43.760 --> 1:35:49.520]  serious than what is being hyped in terms of its actual health effects on people uh let me give you
[1:35:49.520 --> 1:35:54.720]  some understanding of course the bigger effects are going to be the economic effects from shutting
[1:35:54.720 --> 1:36:00.720]  down the economy and shutting down public venues during this period but compared to the common
[1:36:00.720 --> 1:36:07.200]  flu eight percent of americans get the flu each year with perhaps on average about 60 percent of
[1:36:07.200 --> 1:36:14.480]  those americans are exposed to it 11 000 people have already died this year from the common flu
[1:36:14.480 --> 1:36:20.000]  the death rate of course is difficult to tell because most a lot of flu cases go unreported
[1:36:20.000 --> 1:36:26.080]  but the cbc estimates around two percent the chinese death rate from the coronavirus if you
[1:36:26.080 --> 1:36:33.040]  can believe their statistics around 2.3 percent so not a lot of difference in death rates um
[1:36:33.760 --> 1:36:38.480]  but there is a great deal of difference in the infection rate of the coronavirus versus the
[1:36:38.480 --> 1:36:45.360]  common flu probably 80 of people exposed to coronavirus were going to get symptoms 80 instead
[1:36:45.360 --> 1:36:51.280]  of just eight percent of americans with a common flu and that's because this is a weaponized virus
[1:36:51.280 --> 1:36:58.800]  and so it's meant to be able to transfer more rapidly people but despite that few people um
[1:36:59.440 --> 1:37:05.760]  die from it fatality rate will climb to 15 percent for the elderly and those in bad health but
[1:37:05.760 --> 1:37:11.440]  less than one percent the rest of us and that's really important to understand in terms of ability
[1:37:11.440 --> 1:37:17.520]  to resist this virus is to make sure that you get on a healthy regimen and i mean you shouldn't
[1:37:17.520 --> 1:37:22.720]  be overweight you shouldn't be eating any junk food you've got to be eating a lot of natural and
[1:37:22.720 --> 1:37:30.240]  organic food and then you've got to be using some of the really good herbal and products the kinds
[1:37:30.240 --> 1:37:37.840]  that alex sells for example nano silver products are very very good at getting uh killing all of
[1:37:37.840 --> 1:37:44.880]  these types of coronaviruses now you can't point to any medical you know studies to approve these
[1:37:44.880 --> 1:37:50.800]  types of things but there's a lot of real serious anecdotal evidence that does support that additional
[1:37:50.800 --> 1:37:55.360]  evidence proves that mega doses of vitamin c kills the viruses i have personally experienced
[1:37:55.360 --> 1:38:02.400]  with this when i start to get a cold i can down a thousand milligrams of vitamin c every two hours
[1:38:02.400 --> 1:38:07.840]  and that cold will be gone within the day gone and you can see even if you've got a full blown
[1:38:07.840 --> 1:38:15.600]  school cold i can suppress the symptoms with a thousand milligrams every every two hours and so
[1:38:15.600 --> 1:38:21.840]  you know vitamin c is very powerful antiviral suppressant and then of course there's this
[1:38:21.840 --> 1:38:26.960]  famous fireside recipe which is available you can always find that on the internet
[1:38:28.000 --> 1:38:34.560]  but it's a basically a combination of ground up garlic horseradish ginger root cayenne pepper
[1:38:34.560 --> 1:38:41.600]  and extracted through with an apple cider vinegar mix and you strain out the solids after a couple
[1:38:41.600 --> 1:38:46.800]  of weeks of sitting in this solution and take a few tablespoons of that and it's very very
[1:38:46.800 --> 1:38:53.360]  powerful against these viruses of all types and remember the common cold is a coronavirus like
[1:38:53.360 --> 1:39:04.880]  the covid-19 but probably 80 of people exposed to the coronavirus will get symptoms but it's
[1:39:04.880 --> 1:39:10.400]  interesting that most people have especially healthy people have mild symptoms and especially
[1:39:10.400 --> 1:39:16.720]  children it's really only the elderly people 16 above and especially those who have compromised
[1:39:16.720 --> 1:39:22.400]  health things are going to get sick so a lot of this depends on how much exposure you get
[1:39:22.400 --> 1:39:29.600]  that for example the doctor in china who who died from who tried to warn the chinese government
[1:39:29.600 --> 1:39:37.600]  got arrested for it with a solitary confinement he got a massive dose of exposure to it and that's
[1:39:37.600 --> 1:39:43.520]  why he is a fairly young person and and healthy died for them because of the massive exposure
[1:39:43.520 --> 1:39:49.440]  you're not going to get that kind of massive exposure unless you get into a force quarantine
[1:39:49.440 --> 1:39:55.360]  situation with the coronavirus and people who are infected that's why it was bad policy
[1:39:56.000 --> 1:40:00.800]  for the japanese and united states government to quarantine the diamond princess in japan
[1:40:00.800 --> 1:40:08.640]  and not let people off the ship unlike early assurances covid-19 is capable of airborne
[1:40:08.640 --> 1:40:14.560]  transmission they have told us for weeks now that you have to actually contact or it's sneezing or
[1:40:14.560 --> 1:40:19.520]  water droplets with the virus and get on the surface to make this contagious absolutely false
[1:40:20.080 --> 1:40:25.440]  princeton university has come out now with a study which i'll be linking to in friday's world
[1:40:25.440 --> 1:40:33.680]  affairs brief about the fact that it is airborne like the common cold and it could last in the air
[1:40:33.680 --> 1:40:39.920]  up to three hours and so if you get stuck in a foreign force quarantine stuck on an airplane
[1:40:39.920 --> 1:40:48.560]  with people you can contact and get infected with coronavirus because of it is an airborne virus
[1:40:50.880 --> 1:40:56.800]  so it's more contagious in the flu but not particularly lethal for healthy people it is
[1:40:56.800 --> 1:41:08.080]  airborne and you can actually you know survive very well and i think most people will get better
[1:41:08.080 --> 1:41:12.960]  from the coronavirus unless they have compromised health a lot of the deaths for example in washington
[1:41:12.960 --> 1:41:19.440]  state which exceeded i guess 14 or 15 came from people in old folks home who were visited by people
[1:41:19.440 --> 1:41:29.360]  who were infected by coronavirus and died from it so avoid force quarantine with a large public
[1:41:29.360 --> 1:41:33.360]  it's okay and those are they should have done with the diamond princess allowed people to go home
[1:41:33.360 --> 1:41:39.440]  home with wearing gloves with wearing a mask so that they don't infect other people get into a
[1:41:39.440 --> 1:41:45.600]  self-quarantine even hospitals in washington state now are sending people home rather than putting
[1:41:45.600 --> 1:41:51.360]  them in the hospital where they circulate the air with other patients and you run the risk as it
[1:41:51.360 --> 1:41:58.160]  happens at most exactly so they use these cruise ships and things to incubate the virus that's
[1:41:58.160 --> 1:42:04.160]  right and that's what happens you know a hotel in the virgin islands it ends up getting a quarantine
[1:42:04.160 --> 1:42:09.920]  and lockdown people are going to get sick by being stuck in the same air circulation system of other
[1:42:09.920 --> 1:42:16.000]  sick people all right stay right there stay right there they're not idiots china all these groups
[1:42:16.000 --> 1:42:20.160]  know that was going to only spread this faster clearly they're using as a political weapon they
[1:42:20.160 --> 1:42:24.080]  admit they're using it the democrats have been very badly disciplined they've admitted they hope
[1:42:24.080 --> 1:42:28.240]  this brings down trump in america uh i think trump's been forced to say he's taking stronger actions
[1:42:28.240 --> 1:42:31.440]  who doesn't get blamed with what's happening but what does that do to the stock market and who
[1:42:31.440 --> 1:42:35.360]  does joel scalzen thinks behind this because i mean there's a bunch of universes and groups
[1:42:35.360 --> 1:42:39.680]  now that look at this virus and said look this is man-made did it escape out of a lab more and more
[1:42:39.680 --> 1:42:46.000]  i think deep state released it you know even above china to cause this global chain reaction
[1:42:46.000 --> 1:42:50.800]  to then be a global financial reset or more joel scalzen gives us his expert take straight ahead
[1:42:50.800 --> 1:42:58.480]  i don't know let's go everybody needs food i'm proud we're selling high quality food elections
[1:42:58.480 --> 1:43:04.000]  globalism the economy the bubble this is something you need on your checklist to have done but for me
[1:43:04.000 --> 1:43:09.760]  it just is a bummer to know that everybody needs food and i had long discussions this morning over
[1:43:09.760 --> 1:43:13.360]  an hour long discussion with different individuals at different levels of this right down to the
[1:43:13.360 --> 1:43:17.920]  folks who run the plants to get the best idea we have but they want me to say six to eight weeks
[1:43:17.920 --> 1:43:23.200]  just so people aren't getting pissed but understand the last food company the biggest food company is
[1:43:23.200 --> 1:43:28.400]  now at hundreds of times their regular order and they were having discussions with me about stopping
[1:43:28.400 --> 1:43:32.640]  the promotion of food sales next week and at a certain point just saying we're done because
[1:43:32.640 --> 1:43:37.200]  people are going to take food orders out 10 weeks we don't want to sit on your money 10 weeks and then
[1:43:37.200 --> 1:43:41.440]  just all the weirdness that comes with that because we're honest under promise over delivered but
[1:43:41.440 --> 1:43:45.040]  technically it's going to be six to eight weeks and we want you to get a great deal and feel like
[1:43:45.040 --> 1:43:49.280]  we took care of you so you come back again we want relationships with you we're not satanists
[1:43:49.280 --> 1:43:53.760]  we're the opposite we don't screw people over we believe in jesus christ and we've been blessed by

[1:46:59.520 --> 1:47:04.800]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[1:47:04.800 --> 1:47:06.800]  you
[1:47:23.600 --> 1:47:27.520]  live from austin texas it's alex jones
[1:47:27.520 --> 1:47:37.280]  and this is joel scousen editor of world affairs brief sitting in for alex for this segment the
[1:47:37.280 --> 1:47:42.640]  next 10 minutes or so we're talking about the corona virus and its impact on the united states
[1:47:43.520 --> 1:47:51.280]  i've discussed in the previous segment how i feel that coronavirus is not that deadly of a virus
[1:47:51.280 --> 1:47:57.680]  the death rate in the united states is probably going to hover around one to two percent which
[1:47:57.680 --> 1:48:04.800]  is actually pretty low and in line with the common flu those and those that are most at risk of
[1:48:04.800 --> 1:48:09.520]  course are those with the compromised immune system elderly people and especially if it gets
[1:48:09.520 --> 1:48:14.720]  into a pneumonia like symptoms where the coronavirus starts to damage the cells of the lungs that
[1:48:14.720 --> 1:48:20.160]  starts to fill up with water those are the people that die so it's important that if you start to
[1:48:20.160 --> 1:48:25.920]  get symptoms from the flu that you get on the recommended herbal or natural remedies such as
[1:48:25.920 --> 1:48:33.280]  many that alex jones sells on his program as well as fire titer megadosus of vitamin c vitamin d3
[1:48:34.000 --> 1:48:41.360]  and it's also a good idea to use as ozoneator air purifier in the home ozone kills pathogens in
[1:48:41.360 --> 1:48:48.640]  the air it's very very effective at precipitating them out of the air now the biggest impact
[1:48:48.640 --> 1:48:53.440]  actually from this coronavirus is going to be the economic impact the current move to limit
[1:48:53.440 --> 1:48:59.280]  public meetings schools public transport airlines sporting events is wise to keep the
[1:49:00.160 --> 1:49:05.440]  spread of it down but it's going to be very very costly to the economy and many businesses will
[1:49:05.440 --> 1:49:12.240]  not survive this i'm surprised if the cruise ship industry survives it will be difficult for
[1:49:13.280 --> 1:49:17.840]  many people who with pensions in in the stock market to survive because the markets are going
[1:49:17.840 --> 1:49:24.000]  to continue to go down they've dropped now into bear market territory that is 20 below their peak
[1:49:24.560 --> 1:49:29.680]  but given that remember that that peak was only reached a couple of months ago and it's a major
[1:49:29.680 --> 1:49:36.080]  bubble and so everybody's pension even at 20 drop in the markets is not really being hurt at this
[1:49:36.080 --> 1:49:41.680]  point there to the beginning of the year but this could get a lot worse for businesses especially
[1:49:41.680 --> 1:49:50.160]  with MBA canceling things the NCAA tournament canceling fan participation and if any of the
[1:49:50.160 --> 1:49:54.800]  players get sick then they're going to have to cancel like the MBA did because of player to
[1:49:54.800 --> 1:50:02.960]  player contact will cause people to to get sick so do get in the habit of not touching your nose
[1:50:02.960 --> 1:50:08.640]  your mouth and your eyes you can be less concerned about how long and detailed in hand washing if
[1:50:08.640 --> 1:50:15.920]  you get over the aspect of touching your nose or your eyes especially because that's where the virus
[1:50:15.920 --> 1:50:22.880]  will get into the system and through the mouth but just being on your hands you know is not that
[1:50:22.880 --> 1:50:30.320]  difficult to to keep safe from as long as you don't touch your nose or mouth now trump has
[1:50:30.320 --> 1:50:36.080]  suspended travel from europe for 30 days as part of a response to foreign corona virus however that
[1:50:36.080 --> 1:50:40.320]  excludes american citizens who want to get back in the country though they will have to undergo
[1:50:40.320 --> 1:50:46.560]  court a quarantine for about 14 days it also excludes their relatives and travelers from the
[1:50:46.560 --> 1:50:52.560]  uk and ireland that's brought a lot of controversy because uk and ireland and not particularly
[1:50:54.640 --> 1:51:02.080]  the speed in terms of you know halting the the spread as is france and other countries italy
[1:51:02.080 --> 1:51:07.040]  has been particularly hit hard because it did not have a ban on travel for china and it got into
[1:51:07.040 --> 1:51:14.320]  the country it needed it aran aran has a 14 percent death rate which is pretty high and a lot of that
[1:51:15.040 --> 1:51:21.120]  is in the elderly in italy that's the same case almost a third of people in italy are elderly
[1:51:21.120 --> 1:51:28.080]  and not particularly healthy so that's why the death rate is up to six percent italy has closed
[1:51:28.080 --> 1:51:35.920]  their bars restaurants and most shops as a severe measure to stop the spread of the virus but it's
[1:51:35.920 --> 1:51:41.680]  interesting in telephone conversations with people i've had in italy even in a near there
[1:51:42.960 --> 1:51:49.760]  the malan area which is the the hot spot that's the big commercial center in in italy where a
[1:51:49.760 --> 1:51:54.640]  lot of foreign travel takes place where the virus has really spread a lot of big corporation
[1:51:54.640 --> 1:52:00.080]  state they don't know anyone who has the coronavirus so it really is spotty it depends if you get in a
[1:52:00.080 --> 1:52:06.400]  cluster of infection where people spread it one to another once again i want to emphasize i do
[1:52:06.400 --> 1:52:12.240]  not think this is that deadly if you take proper health precautions and i'm not talking medical
[1:52:12.240 --> 1:52:19.920]  protocols antibiotics you should not be taking those are really to stop any additional or secondary
[1:52:19.920 --> 1:52:24.640]  bacterial infections when you get a mone pneumonia that's why they give antibiotics for pneumonia even
[1:52:24.640 --> 1:52:29.840]  though pneumonia isn't there's 90 percent of viral disease which antibiotics don't help with
[1:52:30.880 --> 1:52:37.840]  but this has caused a lot of of of these superbugs and bacterias to be created that are resistant to
[1:52:37.840 --> 1:52:42.480]  antibiotics so you must be very very careful about taking antibiotics they do kill the good
[1:52:42.480 --> 1:52:48.800]  bacteria in the gut and it's very very difficult to reestablish that flora within the gut even if
[1:52:48.800 --> 1:52:57.280]  you take certain bacterial supplements to do that it's just important to learn to rely on
[1:52:57.280 --> 1:53:05.280]  natural remedies now let me discuss as alex said at the end of the last segment what's the cause
[1:53:05.280 --> 1:53:12.400]  of this it is my opinion even though there's been a lot of hype on the internet from the left
[1:53:12.400 --> 1:53:16.960]  mostly the global research and other organizations like that that come from the left wing that are
[1:53:16.960 --> 1:53:24.400]  trying to defend russia and china especially china that are saying this was a u.s developed virus and
[1:53:24.400 --> 1:53:31.120]  was and i don't think that that's really true it's very very clear that the bio4 lab in Wuhan by
[1:53:31.120 --> 1:53:36.320]  china was working on this and many other biological weapons i published in the world affairs briefs
[1:53:36.320 --> 1:53:43.440]  the speech by a general some decade ago it's talked about china since i didn't want to destroy
[1:53:43.440 --> 1:53:48.960]  the u.s as an infrastructure they want labans around or living room for chinese they want
[1:53:48.960 --> 1:53:54.080]  to depopulate the united states and you suggest what they're going to do is use a bio weapon
[1:53:54.880 --> 1:54:01.120]  i think that bio weapon did leak out of the lab as land set medical journal pointed out they have
[1:54:01.120 --> 1:54:07.760]  very very poor limitations on garbage disposal especially of gloves it's very easy and that
[1:54:07.760 --> 1:54:12.160]  scavenger economy in china for people to have rounded up a lot of those gloves distributed to
[1:54:12.160 --> 1:54:18.320]  the fish market and got it distributed that way but i think this was blowback to china
[1:54:19.280 --> 1:54:25.760]  for working as seriously to try to destroy the west with a biological weapon i think it's
[1:54:25.760 --> 1:54:30.480]  blowback to them and they're suffering for it their economy has suffered and it in the largest
[1:54:30.480 --> 1:54:35.360]  benefit is that it will force the united states and other economies to start to look for other
[1:54:35.360 --> 1:54:42.240]  manufacture cheap manufacturing sources rather than china which in the long term could help slow
[1:54:42.240 --> 1:54:49.360]  down china's move to to build weapons of mass destruction as readers of the world affairs
[1:54:49.360 --> 1:54:54.720]  brief know it's my considered opinion that russian china are both building for a nuclear
[1:54:54.720 --> 1:54:59.920]  first strike against the west sometime probably when they're ready militarily not toward the end
[1:54:59.920 --> 1:55:06.640]  of this decade and china of course is pouring in billions and billions of dollars to their
[1:55:06.640 --> 1:55:12.480]  weaponization systems not only hypersonic missiles cruise missiles and ballistic missiles
[1:55:13.040 --> 1:55:17.840]  not they're not doing this for defensive purposes the trump administration is working
[1:55:17.840 --> 1:55:23.920]  towards you know trying to get china to join with them in russia in a new extension of the
[1:55:23.920 --> 1:55:31.440]  new start treaty a new treaty involving russia and china and while that's good thinking strategically
[1:55:31.440 --> 1:55:36.000]  because it doesn't do any good you know to have a weapons or disarmament treaty with russia which
[1:55:36.000 --> 1:55:41.760]  cheats on them anyway if you have a third party that's just as powerful russia that you haven't
[1:55:41.760 --> 1:55:46.960]  got a treaty with now i don't have any confidence in arms control treaties actually stopping
[1:55:46.960 --> 1:55:54.640]  uh nuclear proliferation both russia and china will cheat and the united states has secret
[1:55:54.640 --> 1:56:00.800]  weapon systems not necessarily nuclear that uh they're devising as well i mean nobody is naive
[1:56:00.800 --> 1:56:06.480]  enough to to believe that those two countries are actually going to disarm when they're stated
[1:56:06.480 --> 1:56:12.560]  intent as communist countries is to take over the west well that's right all right uh joel
[1:56:12.560 --> 1:56:18.080]  skelzen world affairs brief editor-in-chief thank you for the really informative uh background
[1:56:18.080 --> 1:56:24.160]  info i agree with you they've gone from lands at 15 death rate to five percent to two percent
[1:56:24.160 --> 1:56:29.040]  it is a new novel virus it's manmade it's mutating i believe it's a cover for other weapon systems
[1:56:29.040 --> 1:56:33.760]  out of the same name in the future this is a giant global drill for a lockdown and to try to damage
[1:56:34.960 --> 1:56:40.080]  the economic system to drive trump from power i think trump now has figured that out and hopefully
[1:56:40.080 --> 1:56:46.320]  takes the right actions to deal with that thank you so much for your time it's a pleasure to be
[1:56:46.320 --> 1:56:53.520]  with you alex thank you in 30 seconds what else do you think trump should do well you know he's
[1:56:53.520 --> 1:56:58.480]  trying to bail out the economy with a lot of economic measures and the fed is just pouring
[1:56:58.480 --> 1:57:04.800]  billions into the economy uh they've got a 500 billion dollar payout to the banks this week to
[1:57:04.800 --> 1:57:13.200]  uh support repo agreements or repurchase agreements 175 billions a day for the past four days this is
[1:57:13.200 --> 1:57:17.680]  tremendously a bad for the economy long-term inflation but it's bailing out the banks and
[1:57:17.680 --> 1:57:22.240]  trump shouldn't be doing it all right joel skelzen thank you find out more at worldaversebrief.com

[1:57:48.880 --> 1:57:52.960]  love trump all day long but man i tell you he sits here and lets these big tech people keep
[1:57:52.960 --> 1:57:57.760]  running rough shot over him everybody i mean i've got a problem and we'll just take the trump
[1:57:57.760 --> 1:58:02.240]  rally's over that said about two months ago i came with a plan that i haven't launched yet
[1:58:02.240 --> 1:58:07.920]  we have a warehouse full of hundreds of thousands of stickers 20 different stickers impeach the
[1:58:07.920 --> 1:58:13.360]  democrats save the second amendment defend the first amendment info wars.com and it looks like
[1:58:13.360 --> 1:58:16.960]  duct tape but it's just a regular sticker you put it over your mouth you'd go to a trump rally
[1:58:16.960 --> 1:58:21.200]  and you instantly take over without even disrupting things people say why are you doing this what's
[1:58:21.200 --> 1:58:25.360]  happening when you go well we're being censored you know trump won't do anything about it and
[1:58:25.360 --> 1:58:29.520]  dr pacinic i'm let me just ask you what you think because i've not launched this yet it's brilliant
[1:58:29.520 --> 1:58:35.440]  you've taken the very element that they try to repress you with that silence and made it

[2:03:09.040 --> 2:03:16.720]  to settle damn it why because while the traction may be used lieu of conversation words will always
[2:03:16.720 --> 2:03:22.240]  retain their power words are for the means to meaning and for those who will listen the
[2:03:22.240 --> 2:03:28.960]  annunciation of truth the truth is there is something terribly wrong with this country isn't

[2:03:50.720 --> 2:03:55.680]  well certainly there are those who are more responsible than others they will be held accountable
[2:03:55.680 --> 2:04:01.280]  but again truth be told if you're looking for the guilty you need only look into a mirror
[2:04:01.280 --> 2:04:10.240]  I know why you did it I know you were afraid who wouldn't be war terror disease there were a

[2:05:54.800 --> 2:06:11.520]  the human mind has built the world we've seen and has built the supercomputers
[2:06:12.080 --> 2:06:18.640]  we're now told are gods well we're told we're obsolete we're a joke but we built the things that
[2:06:18.640 --> 2:06:28.240]  are our gods i don't think that's the way it works no god built us so that we can play in
[2:06:28.240 --> 2:06:35.760]  the sandbox and build things that think it's god and try to challenge us and only in that fight for
[2:06:35.760 --> 2:06:43.920]  our life against our own creation will we finally reach up through the ether for god's hand and
[2:06:43.920 --> 2:06:50.240]  make that electrochemical spiritual connection and like lightning bolts and promethean fire
[2:06:51.280 --> 2:06:56.800]  god will then open the door because god is all about free will and you've got to ask
[2:06:57.920 --> 2:07:03.840]  that fire you got to prove you're not going to use that fire against the innocence you've got to
[2:07:03.840 --> 2:07:11.360]  prove that you're not a tyrant before god will smile on you and give you the fire you see the
[2:07:11.360 --> 2:07:15.840]  globalists try to act like they've got god's power and try to imitate what they've seen but
[2:07:15.840 --> 2:07:25.440]  an imitation is not the real thing and it's orders of magnitude weaker this is what you want this is
[2:07:25.440 --> 2:07:33.120]  what you get the question is can you handle that promethean fire so i've been saying for three four
[2:07:33.120 --> 2:07:39.360]  weeks that when you see the big celebrity get it that that will be when the global hysteria
[2:07:39.360 --> 2:07:44.560]  goes into overdrive and i said i believe if i had the crew we'd go back and find that you all heard
[2:07:44.560 --> 2:07:50.320]  it that as soon as trump acknowledges is that it's deadly and announces his plan to fight it
[2:07:50.320 --> 2:07:57.120]  that you'll see them make their other announcements well they did it in doubles they had horrible
[2:07:57.120 --> 2:08:03.440]  globalist i mean you talk about anti-american and his actual political activities anti-gun anti-family
[2:08:03.440 --> 2:08:10.800]  anti-trump anti-america uh so-called you know good boy tom hanks announced he's an australian oh and
[2:08:10.800 --> 2:08:15.680]  he and a co-star for some movie they're making habits so he's he's out there all over the news
[2:08:15.680 --> 2:08:20.640]  during his production all they gotta do is have a doctor claim that happened i believe at a gut level
[2:08:21.360 --> 2:08:26.720]  that fits all the scripting especially because it came out right as trump gave his speech to
[2:08:26.720 --> 2:08:35.760]  overshadow that because in the weird narcissistic needle johnson world the chicken crap dimension
[2:08:35.760 --> 2:08:41.200]  world of people like hanks that's all they care about is being the number one story
[2:08:43.760 --> 2:08:49.120]  and so here's tom hanks three and a half years ago saying trump will never be president
[2:08:49.120 --> 2:08:54.960]  that flying saucers would land with dinosaurs wearing red capes and now he's all part of the
[2:08:54.960 --> 2:08:59.200]  consortium saying trump's done a terrible job you better listen to him as he's a coronavirus victim
[2:08:59.200 --> 2:09:05.360]  here he is but there's a american presidential potential candidate not even nomineer he wants
[2:09:05.360 --> 2:09:10.080]  to make america great is that what donald trump's well here's the problem america's already great so
[2:09:10.080 --> 2:09:15.040]  i don't know what he is talking about he don't think if he becomes a president he'll make make it
[2:09:15.040 --> 2:09:19.520]  great because the states is already i think that man will be president of the united states right
[2:09:19.520 --> 2:09:25.280]  about the time that spaceships come down filled with dinosaurs and red caps i'm at like tom
[2:09:29.760 --> 2:09:37.440]  take it from me how about that and everything is about him and that weird hollywood stinking perch
[2:09:37.440 --> 2:09:44.720]  he sits on like a carrion crow feeding on us so it's gonna john bound's latest very powerful
[2:09:44.720 --> 2:09:49.840]  report that just came out coronavirus enters the second phase this video is important to share it
[2:09:49.840 --> 2:09:55.440]  from band dog video as the coronavirus grows president trump has suspended travel between
[2:09:55.440 --> 2:10:00.400]  the united states and most of europe as the world health organization finally declared the
[2:10:00.400 --> 2:10:06.640]  coronavirus a pandemic today the world health organization officially announced that this is
[2:10:06.640 --> 2:10:13.840]  a global pandemic at the very start of the outbreak we instituted sweeping travel restrictions on
[2:10:13.840 --> 2:10:22.000]  china and put in place the first federally mandated quarantine in over 50 years we declared a public
[2:10:22.000 --> 2:10:29.600]  health emergency and issued the highest level of travel warning on other countries as the virus
[2:10:29.600 --> 2:10:36.320]  spread its horrible infection we will be suspending all travel from europe to the united states for
[2:10:36.320 --> 2:10:43.680]  the next 30 days the new rules will go into effect friday at midnight these restrictions will be
[2:10:43.680 --> 2:10:49.520]  adjusted subject to conditions on the ground there will be exemptions for americans who have
[2:10:49.520 --> 2:10:55.520]  undergone appropriate screenings and these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous
[2:10:55.520 --> 2:11:03.120]  amount of trade and cargo but various other things as we get approval anything coming from europe
[2:11:03.120 --> 2:11:10.000]  to the united states is what we are discussing these restrictions will also not apply to the united
[2:11:10.000 --> 2:11:19.920]  kingdom we are all in this together we must put politics aside stop the partisanship and
[2:11:19.920 --> 2:11:26.960]  unify together as one nation and one family of course democrat haters will hate as they claim
[2:11:26.960 --> 2:11:31.680]  president trump has done nothing you have donald trump saying nothing to worry about here move
[2:11:31.680 --> 2:11:38.400]  along just like the chinese yeah the 2019 to 2020 season of the nba has also been suspended
[2:11:38.400 --> 2:11:44.560]  indefinitely after a player on the utah jazz tested positive while the nc double a march madness
[2:11:44.560 --> 2:11:50.400]  will go on with empty seats meanwhile the first positive case involving a major celebrity has
[2:11:50.400 --> 2:11:56.480]  occurred in australia as tom hanks and his wife rita wilson offered this statement to deadline
[2:11:56.480 --> 2:12:02.160]  hello folks rita and i are down here in australia we felt a bit tired like we had colds and some
[2:12:02.160 --> 2:12:08.880]  body aches rita had some chills that came and went slight fevers too to play things right as is
[2:12:08.880 --> 2:12:14.320]  needed in the world right now we were tested for the corona virus and were found to be positive
[2:12:14.320 --> 2:12:19.440]  hanks and his wife are in their early 60s the beginning of the age group that is strongly
[2:12:19.440 --> 2:12:25.520]  being warned to restrict themselves from public places as much as possible and we are gradually
[2:12:25.520 --> 2:12:30.880]  learning of the effects of the virus on the lungs of those infected as the daily mirror reported
[2:12:30.880 --> 2:12:35.760]  these x-ray images show the damage that corona virus is doing to the lungs of people who catch
[2:12:35.760 --> 2:12:41.440]  the potentially deadly bug doctors have been able to identify specific abnormalities caused by
[2:12:41.440 --> 2:12:46.960]  covid 19 and the patterns are similar to those found in patients from sars and murr's outbreaks
[2:12:46.960 --> 2:12:52.240]  the scans show patches in the lungs and the experts findings could lead to a quicker diagnosis and
[2:12:52.240 --> 2:12:57.760]  help to prevent infections the first person to catch the flu like illness had previously told
[2:12:57.760 --> 2:13:04.160]  how it hit him like a train and left him suffocating and in blinding pain for weeks meanwhile as the
[2:13:04.160 --> 2:13:10.000]  hill reports federally funded tests conducted by scientists from several major institutions
[2:13:10.000 --> 2:13:15.840]  indicated that the novel form of corona virus behind a worldwide outbreak can survive in the air
[2:13:15.840 --> 2:13:23.840]  for several hours well sars was also a corona virus in 2002 it infected a thousand people
[2:13:23.840 --> 2:13:31.440]  and it killed about 775 it had a mortality of about 9 to 10 percent so that's only 8 000 people
[2:13:31.440 --> 2:13:38.240]  in about a year in the two and a half months that we've had this corona virus as you know we now
[2:13:38.240 --> 2:13:47.600]  have multiple multiples of that the seasonal flu that we deal with every year has a mortality of 0.1
[2:13:47.600 --> 2:13:55.440]  percent the stated mortality overall of this when you look at all the data including china
[2:13:55.440 --> 2:14:02.320]  is about three percent it first started off as two and now three i think if you count all the cases
[2:14:02.320 --> 2:14:09.200]  of minimally symptomatic or asymptomatic infection that probably brings the mortality rate down to
[2:14:09.200 --> 2:14:17.280]  somewhere around one percent which means it is 10 times more lethal than the seasonal flu last week
[2:14:17.280 --> 2:14:22.240]  republican members of congress were told that there's a good chance most people in the united
[2:14:22.240 --> 2:14:27.520]  states will eventually be exposed to the corona virus they weren't suggesting that most people
[2:14:27.520 --> 2:14:33.600]  will become infected or ill but that most will encounter the virus meanwhile the super rich
[2:14:33.600 --> 2:14:39.120]  as expected jet off to their bunkers heading off to countries largely unaffected and taking
[2:14:39.120 --> 2:14:48.240]  their own personal doctors and nurses with them just as we've been documenting for years john bound
[2:14:48.240 --> 2:14:53.920]  i'm very proud of the operation for at least 20 years we've exposed that the global elite are
[2:14:53.920 --> 2:15:00.320]  building private air scripts underground bunkers putting in robot anti-tank emplacements and all
[2:15:00.320 --> 2:15:06.080]  that means is they remote control turrets with the decal machine guns and and bigger i mean what is
[2:15:06.080 --> 2:15:11.040]  that for what the hell have they done well they know they've got some evil stuff planned and they
[2:15:11.040 --> 2:15:15.200]  want to protect themselves from what they've done um and and so we'll talk about when we come back
[2:15:15.200 --> 2:15:20.560]  self-isolation is last resort for super rich preparing for coronavirus super rich get off
[2:15:20.560 --> 2:15:26.000]  disaster bunkers jet off disaster bunkers i'm in coronavirus outbreak and dr c pacenic
[2:15:26.000 --> 2:15:31.680]  is going to be coming on as well but this thing is gigantic no matter what perspective or angle
[2:15:31.680 --> 2:15:38.960]  you look at it and a lot of folks survive this but it does jack your lungs up and then come back
[2:15:38.960 --> 2:15:46.320]  and get your heart so i think the hype about it's a little overblown but not by much and it's manmade
[2:15:47.040 --> 2:15:50.320]  they don't want a discussion about that do they we'll be right back stay with us

[2:20:15.280 --> 2:20:19.360]  and dr steve pacenic of steve pacenic dot com is an amazing guest we'll talk to him there just a
[2:20:19.360 --> 2:20:26.560]  moment but i wanted to hit this theme of the left making this racial making this about how
[2:20:26.560 --> 2:20:30.240]  we're racist you know they said trump five weeks ago when he blocked chinese flights
[2:20:30.240 --> 2:20:34.880]  was bad even though russia and japan and south korea had already blocked the flights
[2:20:34.880 --> 2:20:40.400]  he did it later then they criticized him for doing it later now he said no flights from europe
[2:20:40.400 --> 2:20:43.920]  unless they're vetted by medical doctors that sounds reasonable this is as bad as they say
[2:20:43.920 --> 2:20:47.760]  now the democrats say federal judges are going to try to block that and they've got a bill
[2:20:47.760 --> 2:20:52.320]  to stop it so you talk about the murder of common sense how do you say you haven't done enough
[2:20:52.320 --> 2:20:58.960]  then you do something you know and now you're bad mayor of florans encouraged italians to hug a
[2:20:58.960 --> 2:21:02.960]  chinese because they have a lot of imported high school workers you know for the leather shoes and
[2:21:02.960 --> 2:21:08.880]  all that and the clotheries before coronavirus pandemic hit you've heard that whole thing uh
[2:21:08.880 --> 2:21:14.000]  and then we've got these other articles we've got aoc says people aren't going to chinese restaurants
[2:21:14.000 --> 2:21:17.600]  due to racism you know i gotta tell you there's a lot of restaurants i like and honestly you can't get
[2:21:17.600 --> 2:21:22.720]  into i was in one last night it was like no one in there wasn't chinese by the way i everybody knows
[2:21:22.720 --> 2:21:27.040]  was in a japanese restaurant two nights before that and had some socks he got arrested blew under
[2:21:27.040 --> 2:21:30.880]  the limit but still they took me to jail due to the test so i was in a japanese restaurant
[2:21:30.880 --> 2:21:34.560]  it's documented by the police department they actually went and checked the cameras i'm told to
[2:21:34.560 --> 2:21:41.440]  make sure this is getting crazy so so so i was in a japanese restaurant but but this is all happening
[2:21:41.440 --> 2:21:50.320]  but let's let's play this clip first this is a clip here of a costa complains of trump xenophobia
[2:21:50.320 --> 2:21:54.320]  for admitting the virus came from a foreign country because the media is trying to blame him here it
[2:21:54.320 --> 2:22:00.960]  is at one point during this address the president referred to the coronavirus as a quote foreign
[2:22:00.960 --> 2:22:05.920]  virus that that i think was interesting because as i was talking to sources earlier this evening
[2:22:05.920 --> 2:22:09.760]  one of the points that the president wanted to make tonight wanted to get across to americans
[2:22:09.760 --> 2:22:15.120]  is that this virus did not start here uh but that they're dealing with it now why the president would
[2:22:15.120 --> 2:22:19.440]  uh go as far as you've been waiting for a virus that is something we'll also be asking questions
[2:22:19.440 --> 2:22:24.720]  about but it it should be pointed out that steven miller uh who is an immigration hardliner who
[2:22:24.720 --> 2:22:29.920]  advises the president is wanted to point out that your advisors and speech writers right i had was a
[2:22:29.920 --> 2:22:34.640]  driving force in writing the speech and i think it's going to smack uh it's going to come across to
[2:22:34.640 --> 2:22:39.920]  a lot of americans as spacking of a xenophobia yeah that's right you're blaming trump and going
[2:22:39.920 --> 2:22:45.280]  proud thank god the economy is going down yeah that should discredit democrats for a trillion years
[2:22:45.280 --> 2:22:53.200]  man here's aoc people aren't going to chinese food restaurants what the hell trying to project
[2:22:53.200 --> 2:22:57.520]  race onto this they just play every angle but they never think about third dimension what it's
[2:22:57.520 --> 2:23:01.840]  like one dimension like they're rooting for the country to go down they don't know how bad that
[2:23:01.840 --> 2:23:10.240]  looks like this will hurt trouble we're all go bankrupt here she is honestly it sounds almost
[2:23:10.240 --> 2:23:17.280]  so silly to say but there's a lot of restaurants that are feeling the pain of racism where people
[2:23:17.280 --> 2:23:24.080]  are literally not patroning chinese restaurants um they're not patroning asian restaurants because
[2:23:24.080 --> 2:23:28.800]  of just straight up racism around the corona virus so as everyone's seeing i got arrested for
[2:23:28.800 --> 2:23:34.000]  a half bottle of soggy but they're dropping the charges so dr pacenic's laughing about this
[2:23:34.000 --> 2:23:39.520]  the democrats like seize on every political option but they never think that it contradicts
[2:23:39.520 --> 2:23:44.000]  their last statement like you're not doing enough shut down the flights okay i'm shutting the
[2:23:44.000 --> 2:23:48.560]  flights down oh my god you're a racist dr pacenic you're a psychological warfare expert he's
[2:23:48.560 --> 2:23:52.800]  head up state department operations in that what do you call this where they're like tone death like
[2:23:52.800 --> 2:24:04.400]  this just just low IQ it's called stupidity that's a serious case of stupidity ignorance
[2:24:04.400 --> 2:24:11.280]  and narcissism it is so stupid that if she even fought for a moment the let me tell you what kind
[2:24:11.280 --> 2:24:19.520]  of racism is that follows i'll give you the example disney world both in hollywood and in florida
[2:24:19.520 --> 2:24:28.160]  is so full to capacity would she say we're pro mickey mouse or we're anti a chinese restaurant
[2:24:28.160 --> 2:24:34.000]  so we go to pro mickey mouse i mean the the converse of the argument it's so absurd that
[2:24:34.000 --> 2:24:39.680]  she's an idiot i mean basically what you have is stupidity and the notion that out of that you're
[2:24:39.680 --> 2:24:47.680]  gonna make all kinds of collateral and of course you got komo there komo's brother as as the governor
[2:24:47.680 --> 2:24:54.720]  of new york is a disaster the blastio is a disaster as the as the mayor exactly but all they do is go
[2:24:54.720 --> 2:25:00.160]  back to race i'm asking that question clearly they're trying to use this political aims how do you
[2:25:00.160 --> 2:25:06.240]  think that's gonna work out it's not gonna work out it's gonna it's gonna rebound back to the
[2:25:06.240 --> 2:25:12.000]  democrats and when you have a guy like biden which i couldn't believe he would lead the party
[2:25:12.000 --> 2:25:19.520]  senile demented a year ago i said it on your show he was it had senile dementia classical
[2:25:19.520 --> 2:25:25.360]  i'm a board examiner and psychiatry neurology i don't hear one psychiatrist from yell who
[2:25:25.360 --> 2:25:29.840]  although i spend a few minutes as a guy that's like you know board certified you're the guy that
[2:25:29.840 --> 2:25:35.120]  inspects hospitals i'm your psychiatrist all of it when you watch him you say classic explain it to
[2:25:35.120 --> 2:25:42.000]  the people what i am is you go through med school then you go to residency once you go through
[2:25:42.000 --> 2:25:49.440]  residency you pass your boards of two years afterwards on top of that those people who examine
[2:25:49.440 --> 2:25:57.760]  you in the board are called board examiners so in the hierarchy of a tradition in medicine the
[2:25:57.760 --> 2:26:03.680]  board examiners are the highest level because we either determine whether you become a neurologist
[2:26:03.680 --> 2:26:09.760]  or psychiatrist and that's i've been doing that for 10 years unfortunately for 10 years i've been
[2:26:09.760 --> 2:26:16.240]  flunking 60 percent from harvard and yell of all these psychiatrists who couldn't give me a diagnosis
[2:26:16.240 --> 2:26:22.400]  of the patient sitting right in front of them and instead we're talking about absolute nonsense
[2:26:22.400 --> 2:26:27.360]  and that's what you're seeing right here now you're talking to it's a man it's a mass mental
[2:26:27.360 --> 2:26:31.280]  breakdown how does that work in mob psychology because i mean that it seems like they're all
[2:26:31.280 --> 2:26:38.080]  going insane well it's not only they're going insane what's happening is the minute you have
[2:26:38.080 --> 2:26:47.120]  this sense of corona virus and a and a rationale for people to be fearful they'll project that fear
[2:26:47.120 --> 2:26:52.480]  onto something they really don't like well who's the person they don't like the most among the
[2:26:52.480 --> 2:26:58.720]  democrats oh i'm shocked it's trump nevertheless trump gave a brilliant speech last night he
[2:26:58.720 --> 2:27:03.760]  explained exactly what he was going to do he explained the rationale for it he said i'm going
[2:27:03.760 --> 2:27:10.880]  to give you money we're going to do all the necessary things that cdc requires hhs requires
[2:27:10.880 --> 2:27:16.720]  and by the way i'm going to make sure that you don't get sick and we get we go ahead and make
[2:27:16.720 --> 2:27:23.840]  america great so then he said look the virus came from who will harm it's a clear it came from
[2:27:23.840 --> 2:27:30.000]  who harm president g of china can't say he didn't have the virus there and many of the viruses
[2:27:30.000 --> 2:27:38.560]  started in china because the chinese sense of hygiene is very low even 30 years later when
[2:27:38.560 --> 2:27:44.640]  i've been in china you would see people spitting on the ground in front of you they have an unusual
[2:27:44.640 --> 2:27:52.400]  market where the animal is a giant pig pin that's correct and from the pig pin and the bats in china
[2:27:52.400 --> 2:27:59.360]  the coronavirus went right into humans and some of the great virologist who weren't all that great
[2:27:59.360 --> 2:28:04.960]  thought it would never pass on to the humans from the animals but it did and it's spread
[2:28:04.960 --> 2:28:11.440]  it's not lethal i said it a month ago on your show it will be a pandemic exactly what i said
[2:28:11.440 --> 2:28:18.160]  but the very few people will die so less than three percent of the people die all over the world
[2:28:18.160 --> 2:28:24.320]  and we have less than three percent of people dying here because normally the people who will die
[2:28:24.320 --> 2:28:31.360]  are usually in my age from 60 to 80 or 90 but they are compromised in terms of their health stay
[2:28:31.360 --> 2:28:35.840]  there don't pretend it because i'm fascinated with all this in your expertise but i want to go back to
[2:28:35.840 --> 2:28:41.280]  you as a board certified psychiatrist examiner the guy that's over the doctors look i'm no doctor
[2:28:41.280 --> 2:28:45.440]  i just know he went from like a year ago being able to talk to not being able to talk i said
[2:28:45.440 --> 2:28:50.080]  i said looks like a stroke looks like dementia we've all had family that gets like that but as
[2:28:50.080 --> 2:28:56.800]  a medical doctor what are you seeing with biden we can all agree these are troubled times right

[2:29:57.200 --> 2:30:02.480]  i hadn't tried it except for maybe the last week and a half and i told alex i said man this is the
[2:30:02.480 --> 2:30:06.000]  best toothpaste i've ever tried he's like well what are you doing just sitting in here telling me
[2:30:06.000 --> 2:30:11.600]  you got to get up there and tell me and oh so here i am telling people super silver whitening
[2:30:11.600 --> 2:30:17.280]  toothpaste is by far the best toothpaste i've ever tried and i'm 45 years old and i've tried a lot
[2:30:17.280 --> 2:30:22.640]  of different toothpaste and it's fluoride free i think the big difference the game changer in this
[2:30:22.640 --> 2:30:27.680]  is the coral calcium because after i brush my teeth with this they feel so clean and the
[2:30:27.680 --> 2:30:32.480]  toothpaste that i don't even like rinse out my mouth after i brush my teeth with this it feels so
[2:30:32.480 --> 2:30:38.880]  good it feels like it feels like good things are happening in my mouth in fact i find myself
[2:30:38.880 --> 2:30:44.640]  brushing my teeth three to four times a day rather than just twice a day now because i like the way
[2:30:44.640 --> 2:30:59.120]  it feels six weeks ago we warned you that the choreographed nature of the global media and

[2:31:05.200 --> 2:31:10.560]  super deadly or not the issue is it's being used by the globalist as a weapon against the world

[2:33:59.040 --> 2:34:05.120]  six weeks ago and i saw the pre-programming the hysteria in china the scripted looks of
[2:34:05.120 --> 2:34:09.520]  the police and the emergency workers and i said whether this virus is super deadly or not
[2:34:09.520 --> 2:34:14.480]  they're using this to clamp down and take control of their country to face save over what happened
[2:34:14.480 --> 2:34:22.240]  in taiwan and that rebellion pretty much succeeding and this is going to end up being projected they've
[2:34:22.240 --> 2:34:26.640]  set the precedent at the west and then they're going to say that trump didn't respond right i
[2:34:26.640 --> 2:34:30.000]  could just see it they're all opportunists we know what's going to happen it happened like i said i
[2:34:30.000 --> 2:34:33.360]  don't know how i know this stuff i just i just i was like i said before 9-11 i said they're going
[2:34:33.360 --> 2:34:36.800]  to blow up the world trade center and blame it on bin laden within two months i could just see the
[2:34:36.800 --> 2:34:43.040]  pre-programming well this was even more obvious okay and then i get daughter pochetic and limbaugh
[2:34:43.040 --> 2:34:48.080]  and the president wanting to play it down four or five weeks ago trying to defeat the propaganda
[2:34:48.080 --> 2:34:51.760]  and the hype because yeah it probably does kill half percent or even less that's even sick people
[2:34:51.760 --> 2:34:58.480]  old people that's still sad it's still a problem but now they've gotten all the big institutions
[2:34:58.480 --> 2:35:03.440]  of the mba and big tech to panic and cancel everything and i just think underestimating the
[2:35:03.440 --> 2:35:09.360]  hysteria not the virus but the hysteria is is a is a big problem and i just think the president
[2:35:09.360 --> 2:35:14.640]  is doing good now getting out ahead and saying okay it's a problem and then and then use their own
[2:35:14.640 --> 2:35:18.480]  propaganda against them sure the borders are all shut down sure we're going to deport people now
[2:35:18.480 --> 2:35:23.840]  we're instead of just being in a defense mode i get wanting to defeat the propaganda but daughter
[2:35:23.840 --> 2:35:28.960]  pochetic just looking at this i know you want to just say oh look like it came out of the pig
[2:35:28.960 --> 2:35:34.000]  pins and the slop things but big universities are out saying it's man-made and then i look at the
[2:35:34.000 --> 2:35:40.320]  different mutations and the different death rates and i see the left all saying thank god for this
[2:35:40.320 --> 2:35:44.800]  is to bring trump down i think if the president i've been saying this for months over a month
[2:35:44.800 --> 2:35:50.800]  and talks about the providence of it and and then looks at the chai comms as releasing it
[2:35:50.800 --> 2:35:55.760]  they're shut down instead of being victims and now look at this just broke and you know go
[2:35:55.760 --> 2:36:00.880]  who's now reporting this it's links to it major chinese news the chinese foreign minister just
[2:36:00.880 --> 2:36:05.680]  spread conspiracies u.s military started the coronavirus in china has been added by left
[2:36:05.680 --> 2:36:09.440]  wing u.s media it's not being picked up by these people everywhere we have called those who linked
[2:36:09.440 --> 2:36:15.600]  the virus luhan where it first manifested races and so here it is and there's all these articles
[2:36:15.600 --> 2:36:19.920]  saying don't look at the providence don't say it came from china seeing and saying don't even say
[2:36:19.920 --> 2:36:26.240]  it came from china because now they're gonna say it came from the united states uh dr pochetic what
[2:36:26.240 --> 2:36:33.280]  do you make of this what i make of this is exactly what we said and i said about a year ago president
[2:36:33.280 --> 2:36:40.800]  ji has taken over a country using the most antiquated ideology in the world even for the
[2:36:40.800 --> 2:36:47.920]  chinese mao zitong and he really doesn't understand mao very well mao had killed so many million
[2:36:47.920 --> 2:36:54.960]  people and also beat up his father beat him up instead of rebelling against it ji who i don't
[2:36:54.960 --> 2:37:03.440]  think is all that bright literally held on to this ideology in order to coerce all of china into one
[2:37:03.440 --> 2:37:09.520]  massive response well that's not going to work what you saw in hong kong and in a way what you saw
[2:37:09.520 --> 2:37:16.240]  his clampdown on high bay and hunan is really a reaffirmation of what he thinks to be the
[2:37:16.240 --> 2:37:23.520]  seizure of communism it's a contradictory term but he is the Stalin of communism or no he's the
[2:37:23.520 --> 2:37:30.800]  dear leader he's a dictator now well he is a dictator but in fact what it really shows and many of the
[2:37:30.800 --> 2:37:38.400]  chinese are seeing exactly what i saw is the weakness within his own character and his understanding
[2:37:38.400 --> 2:37:46.480]  of how to control the chinese and the fact that he panicked and wasn't around wuhan for 10 12 days
[2:37:46.480 --> 2:37:51.360]  you know why didn't he hide out for i think it was more than two weeks correct he was gone for two
[2:37:51.360 --> 2:37:59.120]  weeks he was scared he was fearful and instead he took his minions sent them over to hunan and said
[2:37:59.120 --> 2:38:06.160]  you take be in charge and then fired them this is the classical lazy cowardly very Stalinistic
[2:38:07.200 --> 2:38:14.080]  extremely so in this case it's Mao Zedong but you don't have a donk chow pin because behind him
[2:38:14.080 --> 2:38:19.840]  should be a technocrat or a military leader within the pla if i were there in the people's
[2:38:19.840 --> 2:38:27.120]  liberation army i would have attempted a coup against ji because number one it was obvious to me
[2:38:27.120 --> 2:38:34.880]  as a leader of the people's liberation army that ji as a civilian is not qualified to be able to
[2:38:35.520 --> 2:38:43.600]  hold on to the power or the illusion of power that he has created in china secondly he has
[2:38:43.600 --> 2:38:49.280]  really gotten a major problem now and that was the economic problem you and i talked about
[2:38:49.280 --> 2:38:55.360]  six seven months ago where he didn't know how to build up his economy then the growth rate was six
[2:38:55.360 --> 2:39:03.840]  percent normally it fell down to way below four or three and so much zero down it's it's negative
[2:39:03.840 --> 2:39:10.000]  now he can't really turn it around that's why i think there's an opportunity now within the
[2:39:10.000 --> 2:39:17.360]  people's communist party for someone else who is a technocrat not exactly hujintow but someone
[2:39:17.360 --> 2:39:24.560]  like donk chow ping who can take over from ji and go along with the people's liberation why is
[2:39:24.560 --> 2:39:30.480]  ji in power because he can make deals with western corporations and he bent over is that why well he's
[2:39:30.480 --> 2:39:37.760]  totally corrupt i mean the the key to chinese power is what we call guan chi pu an xi means
[2:39:37.760 --> 2:39:44.880]  relationships he has totally co-opted his pilot bureau and the infrastructure on the regional
[2:39:44.880 --> 2:39:52.640]  basis with guan chi dollars money corruption he's staying there with the aid of corruption however
[2:39:53.280 --> 2:39:58.960]  if there was anybody challenging him which i'm really saying right now from the people's liberation
[2:39:58.960 --> 2:40:05.680]  army where there's less corruption or the technocrats who understand that they can no longer run china
[2:40:05.680 --> 2:40:11.600]  on a credit system which is what they've been doing and making up numbers because they can't
[2:40:11.600 --> 2:40:17.440]  mark to the market which means if they have a hundred million dollar loan on a property and the
[2:40:17.440 --> 2:40:23.120]  property is worth a hundred million they won't discount that loan to zero and instead say oh yeah
[2:40:23.120 --> 2:40:27.440]  well we have a hundred million dollars net worth sure they have the most rigged economy in the world
[2:40:27.440 --> 2:40:32.880]  so so let me ask you this then okay how to obviously opportunities in the west are trying to use
[2:40:32.880 --> 2:40:38.720]  this to overthrow trump gut level just salting it out better pretending how do you see this whole
[2:40:38.720 --> 2:40:43.680]  attempt to blame america for the wool on virus and to bring down trump how do you see that going
[2:40:43.680 --> 2:40:48.800]  and how does trump need to counter that the way trump needs to counter it is exactly what he's
[2:40:48.800 --> 2:40:55.120]  been doing now he went out he's providing finances he's providing a leadership he's articulating that
[2:40:55.120 --> 2:41:01.840]  leadership he's allowing tony fouchy to express exactly the scientific point of view where tony
[2:41:01.840 --> 2:41:07.920]  who's trained me at Cornell medical school said look it's going to be pervasive i said before on
[2:41:07.920 --> 2:41:13.280]  this show a couple of months ago it would be a pandemic that's just a fancy word to say it will
[2:41:13.280 --> 2:41:19.120]  spread but the number of people who will die will be far less than anybody you could imagine and
[2:41:19.120 --> 2:41:23.680]  that's what trump said last night he said listen it's part of life bad stuff happens we're tough
[2:41:23.680 --> 2:41:28.560]  let's deal with it just like rosenfeld said the only thing to fear is for itself get ready that's
[2:41:28.560 --> 2:41:32.640]  great get ready but don't like getting a fetal position and start pissing all over yourself
[2:41:32.640 --> 2:41:39.360]  correct and and in the fact alex what we need is exactly what we have which is a business man in
[2:41:39.360 --> 2:41:45.920]  contrast you have nancy Pelosi who held back all of the money in order to get democratic you know
[2:41:47.040 --> 2:41:54.000]  goodies in there and she's made it a politicized issue well nancy's not going to be around much
[2:41:54.000 --> 2:42:00.400]  longer neither is bernie sanders neither is schumer it's a whole clean sweep within a year i predict
[2:42:00.400 --> 2:42:06.960]  next year that you and i will see trump back again and republicans coming into california as a
[2:42:06.960 --> 2:42:11.200]  matter of fact one of the candidates called me up no you said that a few months ago that they
[2:42:11.200 --> 2:42:15.680]  looked ready for california to swing back red and now they're admitting there's a total turn
[2:42:15.680 --> 2:42:21.760]  against democrats because they can't run sanitation they can run nothing it's not only they can't run
[2:42:21.760 --> 2:42:28.560]  alex it's that they cause more problems nancy Pelosi's nephew or family member Newsom created
[2:42:28.560 --> 2:42:35.920]  85 000 new homeless on lebray in los angeles and increased the number of homeless in san francisco
[2:42:35.920 --> 2:42:40.000]  from 85 000 stay there let's come back without a pathetic i don't think people that don't live
[2:42:40.000 --> 2:42:46.080]  in austin or la or san francisco or portland or seattle you get it you're talking about zombie
[2:42:46.080 --> 2:42:50.560]  homeless running around no matter where you are poor neighborhood rich it's like day of the dead
[2:42:50.560 --> 2:42:56.720]  they're crapping everywhere how did this happen i also want to say that i'm happy to be helping out
[2:42:56.720 --> 2:43:02.800]  with an enterprise that is supported by all the work to help people be prepared and instead of just
[2:43:02.800 --> 2:43:06.960]  giving in to sickness care take care of their health they care of their nutrition in a way that
[2:43:06.960 --> 2:43:11.920]  contributes to greater vitality and i say that from personal experience because i know that the
[2:43:11.920 --> 2:43:17.360]  products that are being offered here i've tried them and i i use them every day and that power pack
[2:43:17.360 --> 2:43:23.200]  that they have the ampm power pack well i wouldn't be so energetic this morning except that i have
[2:43:23.200 --> 2:43:28.080]  been on a regular customer in that regard i just wanted to start out by saying that because i think
[2:43:28.080 --> 2:43:32.480]  it's important to remember that beyond the theoretical ways in which we're trying to help
[2:43:32.480 --> 2:43:37.600]  equip people to think about these great events in the world one of the priorities has to be to take
[2:43:37.600 --> 2:43:45.200]  care of yourself remembering that our lives are a gift from god that he intends us to use for good
[2:43:45.200 --> 2:43:50.560]  purpose for our families and for our communities and right now folks who are willing to think like
[2:43:50.560 --> 2:43:56.240]  we do are critical to the future of america rich in alabama rich thanks for calling hey mr
[2:43:56.240 --> 2:44:03.600]  johns appreciate it first thing i love the turbo force i drive truck for a living and it's amazing
[2:44:03.600 --> 2:44:08.400]  coffee kind of gives you a little crash there at the end but that turbo force is amazing
[2:44:08.400 --> 2:44:14.400]  how is turbo force different than coffee i i'll tell you what it's sustainable anywhere from
[2:44:14.400 --> 2:44:20.800]  uh 18 hours i don't feel the jitters like i do drinking coffee and it's just you know at the end
[2:44:20.800 --> 2:44:27.120]  of the day i don't need anything to go to bed i'll you know i'll pop a knockout and i'm out cold
[2:44:27.120 --> 2:44:30.880]  well that's what we went out to a top developer who didn't want his name on it and i said what would
[2:44:30.880 --> 2:44:37.600]  the ultimate long say 10 hour energy be is that possible that's good and clean and strong and has
[2:44:37.600 --> 2:44:41.520]  a bunch of different forms of energy that are healthy and natural that are time released and
[2:44:41.520 --> 2:44:46.960]  there's more money in it than anybody else puts in their product so that's why turbo force has
[2:44:46.960 --> 2:44:50.720]  such a great effect and so i really appreciate you and i'm glad that you like turbo force
[2:44:54.320 --> 2:44:59.760]  we always promote being prepared having firearms knowing how to use them and be self-sufficient
[2:44:59.760 --> 2:45:04.080]  and learn how to hunt and learn how to garden i mean it's just what we're meant to do it feels
[2:45:04.080 --> 2:45:09.120]  good when we do it but we do so high quality swarble food i told my patriot a month ago i said
[2:45:09.120 --> 2:45:11.840]  what can you handle i said i think it's gonna be really big and they said well we can handle
[2:45:11.840 --> 2:45:14.960]  probably this we're not sure we're investing everything we've got to even pay it forward to
[2:45:14.960 --> 2:45:17.920]  be able to fund i said no i think this is going to be huge i think you should spend everything
[2:45:17.920 --> 2:45:21.440]  you have coming in to secure more food even though the prices are going up for you so those are the
[2:45:21.440 --> 2:45:25.760]  top discussions we have i'm just giving the inside base of all of all of us this is a hundred times
[2:45:25.760 --> 2:45:30.720]  regular volume plus it was a hundred times a few days ago now it's about 200 times okay an
[2:45:30.720 --> 2:45:35.040]  info war store dot com you go right in the queue first come first serve but the fact that the
[2:45:35.040 --> 2:45:40.240]  orders are so ultra massive it's dizzy i mean this is just insane we're expecting to have to put
[2:45:40.240 --> 2:45:45.600]  six to eight weeks to be safe and then if it continues like this we're looking at having to
[2:45:45.600 --> 2:45:50.240]  suspend food sales but everybody gets their order in we'll get your food but that's how big this is
[2:45:50.240 --> 2:45:53.760]  so what you're getting is a hundred percent the straight deal of what's going on info war store
[2:45:53.760 --> 2:46:00.480]  dot com we know that the globalists are in trouble humanity's waking up to their tyranny how they run
[2:46:00.480 --> 2:46:05.680]  their scams their Ponzi schemes how they're building a post-human world but we know they're
[2:46:05.680 --> 2:46:11.200]  going to strike back and the UN has said that they're going to absolutely implode third world
[2:46:11.200 --> 2:46:17.360]  countries and then use those giant populations as weaponized hordes to come in and overwhelm the
[2:46:17.360 --> 2:46:23.840]  west and collapse our social services in a giant clowered and pivot program the UN also has said
[2:46:23.840 --> 2:46:30.960]  they'll use mass plagues to make us capitulate to world government inner coronavirus this is a
[2:46:30.960 --> 2:46:37.120]  critical year and it's a critical time to stay informed and to be spreading the word because
[2:46:37.120 --> 2:46:42.480]  people are waking up like never before but this fight against tyranny is neck and neck so spread
[2:46:42.480 --> 2:46:50.400]  the word about band dot video and info wars dot com ford slash show that is so important you are at
[2:46:50.400 --> 2:47:06.320]  the center of the resistance you are our only hope you're listening to the alex jones show
[2:47:06.320 --> 2:47:16.320]  you
[2:47:18.080 --> 2:47:27.120]  cyrus jones from 1810 to 1913 made his great-grandchildren believe you could live to 103
[2:47:28.960 --> 2:47:34.560]  103 is forever when you're just a little kid so cyrus jones so
[2:47:34.560 --> 2:47:40.960]  so cyrus jones live forever great digger well we've already dug the grave for communism
[2:47:42.080 --> 2:47:46.320]  when you dig my we're digging the grave for globalism would you make a we're building that
[2:47:46.320 --> 2:47:54.160]  stairway to heaven towards americanism so our steve schnick's a really smart guy best selling
[2:47:54.160 --> 2:48:00.640]  author researcher steve schnick dot com i wanted to ask him then we went to break how do you mismanage
[2:48:00.640 --> 2:48:05.600]  and and like austin tripled homeless in like one year they admit that how do you create
[2:48:06.240 --> 2:48:14.480]  what you got a la now and it looks like a war the world's or or i guess the road warrior i mean
[2:48:14.480 --> 2:48:20.800]  everywhere you go it's hellish and everything's breaking down what have they done what's unfolding
[2:48:20.800 --> 2:48:27.600]  not just one area or one sector or one no it's everywhere so so that's key to talk about where
[2:48:27.600 --> 2:48:33.760]  this is all going to understand the psychology of the democrats dot are pretending basically
[2:48:33.760 --> 2:48:42.800]  what you have is a party that was highly corrupt in uh california and dominated by very strong left
[2:48:42.800 --> 2:48:49.520]  wing politicians they were often often it was called the waxman burman machinery which literally
[2:48:49.520 --> 2:48:56.240]  implemented a lot of the laws now you have a taiwanese china man named lee or lu who's taken
[2:48:56.240 --> 2:49:03.840]  over but but for the most part you have ascendancy of family members after family members polosi came
[2:49:03.840 --> 2:49:10.080]  out of a corrupt family was aristocracy again well it's not even an aristocracy it's the reverse
[2:49:10.080 --> 2:49:19.280]  it's a deficient defunct highly corrupt system which started with the italian mobs in bolton
[2:49:19.280 --> 2:49:27.200]  tomorrow with nepotistic mental illness corruption yeah this is basically nepotism this is an
[2:49:27.200 --> 2:49:33.760]  incredible amount of corruption and the inability to really manage anything none of them built the
[2:49:33.760 --> 2:49:41.440]  business despite the fact that newson was brought in by getty all of them i mean how does this woman
[2:49:41.440 --> 2:49:51.440]  this moron worth 130 million dollars on a salary of 240 000 how do you get another idiot like feinstein
[2:49:51.440 --> 2:49:59.120]  87 years old worth 80 million dollars on her salary so what you're seeing is the corruption of the
[2:49:59.120 --> 2:50:06.880]  senate of congress and often the presidency the irony with trump is he doesn't need to be corrupted
[2:50:06.880 --> 2:50:12.160]  he knows exactly what it takes to build a casino new jersey no sure he wants to overthrow the whole
[2:50:12.160 --> 2:50:17.760]  corrupt system be the turnaround guy for america which makes him the new joerce washington now you
[2:50:17.760 --> 2:50:25.360]  got it he's the 21st century president who came in without the same portfolio everybody else did
[2:50:25.360 --> 2:50:29.680]  well washington came in pissed that he was never even allowed in because he didn't have the insider
[2:50:29.680 --> 2:50:36.080]  portfolio it's the same story again correct but washington remember had killed a british officer
[2:50:36.080 --> 2:50:42.480]  and he was technically considered a terrorist by the british now trump is not a terrorist but he
[2:50:42.480 --> 2:50:48.480]  came in as somebody quote who the assistant did not like so in that way they're very similar the
[2:50:48.480 --> 2:50:55.280]  truth of the matter is trump knows every mafia guy from here to california all over the world he
[2:50:55.280 --> 2:51:02.480]  knows exactly how to make a deal with president g or pooton we've never had presidents like that
[2:51:02.480 --> 2:51:09.200]  he understands the personality because on a gut level he says i like that guy when he says i like
[2:51:09.200 --> 2:51:13.440]  him there's a lot of meaning to it now whatever what i'm going to explain what that means that
[2:51:13.440 --> 2:51:19.360]  this means he understands how to deal with him correct and that means on a one-to-one relationship
[2:51:19.360 --> 2:51:25.360]  which is really what this republic is about that the key person representing us is the one who
[2:51:25.360 --> 2:51:31.520]  understands the best that we're not going to go to wars anymore as he's shown in afghanistan
[2:51:31.520 --> 2:51:36.160]  and thank you xiaomi hollows out for finally culminating the war isn't that a positive thing
[2:51:36.160 --> 2:51:41.120]  that trumps the the peace president getting no credit well he's getting no credit because
[2:51:41.120 --> 2:51:46.800]  you've got idiots like cheney who was the daughter of a chicken hawk who never went to prison for
[2:51:46.800 --> 2:51:52.080]  the lies and crimes he committed we don't have accountability if we had accountability you would
[2:51:52.080 --> 2:51:56.960]  have after your president's the clinton's you would have it all be in prison we'd be carrying
[2:51:56.960 --> 2:52:01.600]  trump on our shoulders correct but you'd have the rest of them in prison so we don't have that
[2:52:01.600 --> 2:52:07.360]  accountability without that accountability trump has to work harder to say look i'm different from
[2:52:07.360 --> 2:52:13.040]  these guys i may use some of the same people but you're gonna watch what i'm gonna do the economy
[2:52:13.040 --> 2:52:19.600]  tanked it wasn't because of trump the corona virus came in and hit our supply chain no exactly but i
[2:52:19.600 --> 2:52:23.920]  think the left's wrong i think if they take the economy it's like hitler bombing london i don't
[2:52:23.920 --> 2:52:29.040]  think people turn against trump now i think they get mad at democrats oh you're absolutely right
[2:52:29.040 --> 2:52:34.560]  they're gonna say very simply this is the democratic issue because the democrats are the one you know
[2:52:34.560 --> 2:52:39.920]  they're still wealthy they didn't get hurt trump is the one who said we're gonna put in money trillions
[2:52:39.920 --> 2:52:45.440]  of dollars into the economy i'm gonna cut the interest rates and the democrats have been cheerleading
[2:52:45.440 --> 2:52:52.720]  on every channel hoping the virus hurts america i watch panels on msnbc cnm with like six seven people
[2:52:52.720 --> 2:52:59.360]  hoping it hurts us it's like the most discrediting thing i've ever seen well alex you have more
[2:53:00.080 --> 2:53:06.640]  you have more enthusiasm and and staying power than i do i have no interest whatsoever to watch them
[2:53:06.640 --> 2:53:11.600]  they're the same it's a perception i agree they're a facade they have almost no viewers but it shows
[2:53:11.600 --> 2:53:17.440]  the mind of these people that they would go on tv and root against their own country it's just like
[2:53:17.440 --> 2:53:24.080]  well but you gotta understand something they don't they've never served our country they have no idea
[2:53:24.080 --> 2:53:30.640]  what service to the country is they have no idea what it means to get outside of washington or la
[2:53:30.640 --> 2:53:37.440]  or hollywood so what do you have you have a diss diss the disintegration of hollywood that came in
[2:53:37.440 --> 2:53:44.160]  and that's gone you've got the rise of new streaming services you have the end of many of the left wing
[2:53:44.160 --> 2:53:49.120]  you know units that brought them into power the political system so they're the dinosaurs
[2:53:49.120 --> 2:53:56.160]  haven't figured out they're dead yet so what do you expect to happen next then what i expect to
[2:53:56.160 --> 2:54:01.120]  happen next is they're going to be a landslide victory for trump he's going to come back in
[2:54:01.120 --> 2:54:06.800]  and then he's going to fire a lot of the people in the government what you're seeing now with the
[2:54:06.800 --> 2:54:12.160]  corona virus and the fact that they're being you know isolated means we don't need these people
[2:54:12.160 --> 2:54:16.960]  in the government most of them are part time and most of them don't even work when they're there
[2:54:16.960 --> 2:54:22.080]  so that's the beginning of the end of the large federal government the second part is we're going
[2:54:22.080 --> 2:54:27.680]  to pull all our troops back from where they belong and thirdly we're probably going to increase
[2:54:28.240 --> 2:54:34.800]  the the funding to space warfare not just to nasa but the space warfare exactly like this marine
[2:54:34.800 --> 2:54:39.760]  corps head wants more amphibious assault units from like 50 70 years ago don't we just want more
[2:54:39.760 --> 2:54:45.680]  space weapons that's correct and we don't want any more kinetic action in other words we don't
[2:54:45.680 --> 2:54:51.760]  need tanks we don't need any bazookas we don't need star destroyers we don't need destroyers i don't
[2:54:51.760 --> 2:54:56.800]  even need a star destroyers i'm saying we need weapons platforms of space and then that's right
[2:54:57.440 --> 2:55:01.680]  that's correct but we need a capability we still don't have and that is
[2:55:02.320 --> 2:55:07.520]  cyber communication cyber command i need young people men and women who don't have to go to
[2:55:07.520 --> 2:55:14.240]  college who are able to handle the hacks that are coming in there's one corporation a private one
[2:55:14.240 --> 2:55:19.200]  that gets a hundred million hacks a day that's what we're talking about in the new world it's
[2:55:19.200 --> 2:55:24.880]  binary what's more important physically dominating space or cyber i think cyber is even more important
[2:55:24.880 --> 2:55:31.280]  to space but i guess it's both but cyber right now is the key element then we go into space because
[2:55:31.280 --> 2:55:36.720]  satellites have been shooting at each other for quite a while but we must get into space very
[2:55:36.720 --> 2:55:43.360]  quickly and we must take the spaceship units out of the department of defense and make it solely on
[2:55:43.360 --> 2:55:49.440]  its own as an entity of its own because the air force is too far behind they're not really well
[2:55:49.440 --> 2:55:52.720]  i know a lot of that's classified but i've talked to people that were involved in this we already
[2:55:52.720 --> 2:55:59.120]  had a bunch of robot ships in the 70s up there with the disable du rounds decapitation weapons as
[2:55:59.120 --> 2:56:03.760]  you know i mean now it's like super advanced and obama tried to cut it back and so did others but
[2:56:03.760 --> 2:56:10.080]  i mean clearly we're way ahead in space all right we're we're we're way ahead in space but now what's
[2:56:10.080 --> 2:56:15.760]  going to happen with the coronavirus we're going to look at our supply manufacturing chain and we're
[2:56:15.760 --> 2:56:21.840]  going to look at where the weaknesses were and they're massive where are the airlines coming in what
[2:56:21.840 --> 2:56:26.400]  is the airport where's the post office stop right there we gotta do five more minutes let's come back
[2:56:26.400 --> 2:56:30.720]  and talk about learning how to be self-sufficient and how like pat Buchanan said don't make this
[2:56:30.720 --> 2:56:34.800]  about globalism being the answer making about how globalism was the problem and i think president
[2:56:34.800 --> 2:56:38.720]  trump should do that and then we've got milo yinopoulos coming in dr steve schenick steve schenick
[2:56:38.720 --> 2:56:44.320]  com is our guest a thought-provoking and i said i want him to talk about the senile dementia of
[2:56:45.280 --> 2:56:50.240]  the main presidential front runner for the democrats we'll do that briefly as well please

[2:58:57.600 --> 2:59:02.720]  it's being used by the globalist as a weapon against the world economy and against nation states
[2:59:02.720 --> 2:59:08.560]  and against the populist movement here in america and against info wars and that means against you

[3:00:29.360 --> 3:00:34.720]  make a lot of great points in closing how does this show us that we need to become more self-sufficient
[3:00:34.720 --> 3:00:38.640]  and then i interrupted you with a break 30 minutes ago can you get into
[3:00:38.640 --> 3:00:44.240]  biden and his senile dementia and he seems to be degenerating very very fast let me go
[3:00:44.880 --> 3:00:50.080]  you and i had this conversation a year ago and i said that the minute the democrats invited
[3:00:50.880 --> 3:00:56.320]  psychiatrists from Yale particularly jerry post from the cia and dr brend lee the chairman at
[3:00:56.320 --> 3:01:02.560]  Yale department and 700 like other psychiatrists the designate that trump was a malignant narcissist
[3:01:02.560 --> 3:01:07.760]  which is not correct they opened the door to their own self-destruction and that's really what
[3:01:07.760 --> 3:01:12.960]  we're talking about alex you and i have been talking about the self-destruction of a party
[3:01:12.960 --> 3:01:18.960]  and a people who are so arrogant and so ignorant that they didn't realize they were talking about
[3:01:18.960 --> 3:01:25.520]  their own deficiencies biden has a serious problem i don't wish an economy had two aneurysms
[3:01:25.520 --> 3:01:31.760]  he's totally disoriented time plays in person the democrats right next to him know very well
[3:01:31.760 --> 3:01:36.800]  that he's demented he said a year ago he keeps not knowing where he is everywhere he goes he says
[3:01:36.800 --> 3:01:42.240]  he's in the wrong place now that's correct and he actually confused his daughter and his wife so
[3:01:42.240 --> 3:01:48.560]  it's totally disoriented i can say honestly because i was not asked to come in trump would never
[3:01:48.560 --> 3:01:54.080]  ask me for psychiatric diagnosis and i wouldn't provide it for him i'm saying this to you as a
[3:01:54.080 --> 3:02:02.320]  board examiner a year ago not maliciously and it's not a weapon he is seen now by any car definition
[3:02:02.320 --> 3:02:08.320]  i said the same thing with bernie sand who said he only had a coronary insufficiency and i said that
[3:02:08.320 --> 3:02:13.920]  was a lie he had a heart attack three days later they had to admit he had a heart attack so the
[3:02:13.920 --> 3:02:20.320]  two front-running candidates are the big are literally the forefront of the self-destruction
[3:02:20.320 --> 3:02:24.880]  of the democratic that's my next question how would you keep pushing someone who can't string
[3:02:24.880 --> 3:02:29.040]  a sentence together instead of just worrying about biden which oh you're not what does it say about
[3:02:29.040 --> 3:02:35.200]  the democrats they keep trying to push this guy always remember napoleon said never correct the
[3:02:35.200 --> 3:02:40.080]  mistakes of your enemy i'm not going to correct it i'm saying it to you right the code is don't
[3:02:40.080 --> 3:02:44.480]  interrupt your enemy while they're destroying themselves that's correct thank you you must
[3:02:44.480 --> 3:02:50.640]  know napoleon went apart so no i just know that's a famous quote you're right no no no but i'm
[3:02:50.640 --> 3:02:56.160]  saying alex this is what we don't do we do not interrupt we can talk about it they won't listen
[3:02:56.160 --> 3:03:01.360]  they say we're we're out of tune we're alternative media we're right wing i don't know i agree their
[3:03:01.360 --> 3:03:08.320]  delusion is their real power well i mean is our power to bring them down that's correct remember
[3:03:08.320 --> 3:03:13.600]  everything we talked about is the power for self-destruction and that's exactly what's been
[3:03:13.600 --> 3:03:20.880]  happening nancy polosi tearing up the speech was the final act of a woman who senile even her own
[3:03:20.880 --> 3:03:26.960]  daughter said this is like grandma idly did it and she's totally out of control out of control
[3:03:27.520 --> 3:03:33.200]  diane feinstein doesn't even know what she's doing at 87 years old she has to leave so you're
[3:03:33.200 --> 3:03:38.560]  going to have a shift to the right and to the republican party where for the first time we're
[3:03:38.560 --> 3:03:45.760]  going to say it's enough we have to concentrate on our economy no more wars we want peace and we
[3:03:45.760 --> 3:03:52.240]  want economic self-sufficiency now the beauty of this country if we had one religion it's not
[3:03:52.240 --> 3:04:02.640]  christianity it's entrepreneurism we are by nature and by uh by growth a entrepreneur country i can
[3:04:02.640 --> 3:04:08.880]  go bankrupt here twice or three times without having to pay the penalty of disgrace as i would in
[3:04:08.880 --> 3:04:17.840]  europe or china or in asia so a wildcat the wild west system you got it you got it self-sufficiency
[3:04:17.840 --> 3:04:24.240]  entrepreneur and the ability to make mistakes and to ability to assess in europe the stuff they've
[3:04:24.240 --> 3:04:29.040]  done to me everybody would buy into it i'd be over the more rebel i get the more they do the more
[3:04:29.040 --> 3:04:36.240]  mistakes i make the more wins i have people just love me more because you honestly you're you're a
[3:04:36.240 --> 3:04:42.240]  very bright man and underneath that humor you know very well you're getting your point across and
[3:04:42.240 --> 3:04:48.880]  quite frankly like most other comedians and you've had a lot of them they tend to be the best actors
[3:04:48.880 --> 3:04:52.800]  and the the smartest that's it we're out of time we love you come back soon steve chinnick it's
[3:04:52.800 --> 3:04:57.760]  wonderful that so many people are now thinking about preparedness and that we're seeing record

[3:05:04.320 --> 3:05:09.600]  average person is living hand to mouth paycheck to paycheck and doesn't even know how to change
[3:05:09.600 --> 3:05:15.520]  their tire we need to reverse this trend and start getting prepared and that means even with just
[3:05:15.520 --> 3:05:20.800]  the basics even a three week food supply that you know is always there that you only go to an
[3:05:20.800 --> 3:05:27.680]  emergency that said boosting your immune system is just as critical or even more so and things like

[3:06:43.360 --> 3:06:50.240]  i don't need to fight prove i'm right to prove i'm right
[3:06:52.720 --> 3:06:59.440]  i don't need to be forgiven and that's what's crazy because god already forgave me too stupid
[3:07:00.320 --> 3:07:05.280]  the love was trying to play god made me look guilty and made me look like a bad person all day

[3:07:24.560 --> 3:07:28.400]  hit some news and we're gonna go to break and bring mylo in studio's got a lot to cover you
[3:07:28.400 --> 3:07:32.720]  the great job your stay uh with owens chore i didn't watch when i was live but i saw it at night
[3:07:32.720 --> 3:07:36.880]  and every broadcast was really powerful so the in studio i'm talking about a deep platform
[3:07:36.880 --> 3:07:41.680]  persecuted person but to badge on any stronger now and more hardcore than he was that's a good thing
[3:07:42.400 --> 3:07:48.240]  because the scars aren't blemishes everybody knows there are marks of where we've been and what we've
[3:07:48.240 --> 3:07:54.400]  done like bumper stickers on the back of an rv the states and national parks you've traveled to
[3:07:55.520 --> 3:08:02.480]  i like all my scars they're pretty my physical scars my spiritual scars my emotional
[3:08:02.480 --> 3:08:07.360]  scars they're not fun when they're happening but later isn't it the worst things ever happened to
[3:08:07.360 --> 3:08:12.560]  us and aware of the best things because it's how we judge the rest of the world and how we begin
[3:08:12.560 --> 3:08:19.920]  to appreciate really what life's all about because without conflict righteous conflict there is no
[3:08:19.920 --> 3:08:28.160]  consciousness well there could be nothing more emblematic in a science fiction nightmare horror
[3:08:28.160 --> 3:08:39.360]  novel than joe bite in what futuristic novel written say by robert a hindland in 1962 would you
[3:08:39.360 --> 3:08:43.680]  have a man clearly brain damage involved in incredible corruption you can't string a sentence
[3:08:43.680 --> 3:08:51.120]  together and he's the democratic nominee and if you criticize him you're evil and you're a racist
[3:08:51.120 --> 3:08:59.920]  and you're bad well here's the article it's up on info wars dot com from adan salazar
[3:09:00.640 --> 3:09:06.240]  watch biden called trump's response to wuhan coronavirus xenophobic and that's the new
[3:09:06.240 --> 3:09:12.080]  talking point china shoots people at checkpoints and welds them into their houses and all the other
[3:09:12.080 --> 3:09:19.520]  countries block them but we do it's xenophobic well on the face that's illogical let's see
[3:09:19.520 --> 3:09:27.760]  me he doesn't have logic all he's got is divide and conquer so here's what he had to say while
[3:09:27.760 --> 3:09:34.400]  putting health and safety of the american people first above everything else yesterday we announced
[3:09:34.400 --> 3:09:40.640]  the public health advisory committee of experts who will continue to counsel my campaign and me help
[3:09:40.640 --> 3:09:47.840]  guide our decisions on the steps to minimize further risks but we also we will lead by science
[3:09:47.840 --> 3:09:52.880]  the world health organization now has officially officially declared
[3:09:53.840 --> 3:10:01.760]  covid-19 a pandemic downplaying it being overly dismissive or spreading misinformation is only
[3:10:01.760 --> 3:10:08.720]  going to hurt us and further advantage the spread of the disease but neither should we panic or fall
[3:10:08.720 --> 3:10:16.960]  back on xenophobia labeling covid-19 a foreign virus does not displace the accountability for
[3:10:16.960 --> 3:10:24.400]  the misjudgments that have been taken thus far by the trump administration let me be crystal clear
[3:10:25.680 --> 3:10:31.360]  the corona virus does not have a political affiliation it will infect republicans independence
[3:10:31.360 --> 3:10:38.480]  and democrats alike and will not discriminate based on national origin race gender or zip code
[3:10:39.440 --> 3:10:44.400]  it will touch people in positions of power as well as most vulnerable in our society
[3:10:44.400 --> 3:10:51.280]  and it will not stop bringing all travel from europe or any other part of the world may slow it
[3:10:52.000 --> 3:10:59.120]  but as we've seen it will not stop it and travel restrictions based on favoritism and politics
[3:10:59.120 --> 3:11:05.760]  rather than risk will be counterproductive this disease could impact every nation
[3:11:06.640 --> 3:11:10.640]  well i haven't seen him in like eight months give a straight talk but he you know he progress
[3:11:10.640 --> 3:11:15.760]  that like 15 times and they've got all the american flags behind him because he's not an american he's
[3:11:15.760 --> 3:11:23.360]  a globalist but did you hear all those lies it was it was absolutely stunning one lie after another
[3:11:25.840 --> 3:11:34.720]  simply mind-blowing to see that much deception he said labeling in a foreign virus won't let you
[3:11:34.720 --> 3:11:41.120]  off trump for your bad job because they want to blame trump for it like we told trump six weeks ago
[3:11:41.120 --> 3:11:46.800]  and trump now gets that and thank god he's saving his presidency in the country by exposing him what
[3:11:46.800 --> 3:11:54.480]  a dirty group of filth oh china with its filth and its open sewers still have high tech stuff but
[3:11:54.480 --> 3:12:00.880]  then no sears and the whole factory's workers live in shanty towns oh they don't have any blame oh no
[3:12:00.880 --> 3:12:09.840]  it's all trump it's all america f off joe biden you reanimated corpse go ahead and climb in that
[3:12:09.840 --> 3:12:15.120]  grave but don't do it till you lose the donald trump i wish no harm upon you you piece of garbage
[3:12:18.800 --> 3:12:23.600]  let's shift gears now look at some of these headlines i've got here the feds are going
[3:12:23.600 --> 3:12:30.320]  after bogus coronavirus products should alex jones be worried that's mother jones towards sorrow's
[3:12:30.320 --> 3:12:36.640]  finance so i've done nothing wrong but they say oh the feds are going after bogus products so should
[3:12:36.640 --> 3:12:42.640]  they go after alex that was two days ago here's today here's today alex jones peddling toothpaste
[3:12:42.640 --> 3:12:50.720]  he falsely claims can kill coronavirus that's not actually what i said your post but why are they
[3:12:50.720 --> 3:12:54.960]  attacking me alex jones claims his loyal silver toothpaste kills coronavirus despite jim beggar
[3:12:54.960 --> 3:12:58.880]  being sued for some product old jim beggar sells his for a hundred and twenty something dollars we
[3:12:58.880 --> 3:13:04.720]  sell ours for nineteen ninety five alex jones is telling his viewers that the toothpaste will kill
[3:13:04.720 --> 3:13:13.680]  coronavirus well let's go over the facts approved by lawyers and the pentagon silver soul technology
[3:13:13.680 --> 3:13:19.120]  use info or store dot com products facts silver soul technology is used as the first line of defense
[3:13:19.120 --> 3:13:24.880]  in hospitals and health clinics against viral and bacterial infection the pentagon also uses it
[3:13:24.880 --> 3:13:30.400]  i'll show you documents in a moment dr paul k carlton previously from the texan and university
[3:13:30.400 --> 3:13:33.520]  health and science center wrote to the u.s department of homeland security that silver
[3:13:33.520 --> 3:13:41.120]  soul technology has undergone ridges testing and has been found to kill anthrax bubonic plague
[3:13:42.000 --> 3:13:47.600]  hospital staff and sars from 13 years ago we have a copy the letter on file and have relied
[3:13:47.600 --> 3:13:53.760]  upon it for making representations on air silver soul's own website details how it's been researched
[3:13:53.760 --> 3:14:00.960]  for the fda and cleared and double-blind human and gestion studies were over the counter sale
[3:14:01.600 --> 3:14:07.680]  we consistently work to maintain above fda best practice standards on all of our health
[3:14:07.680 --> 3:14:13.600]  supplements and website compliance and then i've got all the letters right here okay
[3:14:13.600 --> 3:14:20.080]  so they just don't know what to do that we have a company with an approved
[3:14:20.800 --> 3:14:26.080]  nano silver that the pentagon said there's department of army 13 years ago took out sars
[3:14:26.080 --> 3:14:31.280]  when sars is the family of coronavirus now does it take out this very coronavirus
[3:14:33.280 --> 3:14:38.640]  it's like saying if i shoot a wild hog in the head with a 357 magnum and it dies if another
[3:14:38.640 --> 3:14:44.720]  breed of wild hog goes by does a bullet kill it i don't know i mean if i run over a dog versus a
[3:14:44.720 --> 3:14:50.720]  walrus in the highway does it kill it it's ridiculous folks silver's on record and is show
[3:14:50.720 --> 3:14:56.000]  documented and these nano silvers are super powerful and it's what they have in hospitals
[3:14:56.000 --> 3:15:01.520]  and everywhere that debate's over and the democrats get pissed that we go out and find

[3:15:29.200 --> 3:15:33.360]  no if you already have this stuff and you already are infected obviously taking silver

[3:20:35.600 --> 3:20:40.560]  to visit got a new big book about to come out but just first and foremost what's front and center for
[3:20:40.560 --> 3:20:47.040]  you uh well good to see you thanks for having me back uh i've been spending the last couple of weeks
[3:20:47.040 --> 3:20:52.800]  trying to avoid this hysteria about coronavirus and all of the you know it's it's it's it's not
[3:20:52.800 --> 3:20:56.480]  entirely clear to me that it even exists you walk out in the street in new york and austin everything
[3:20:56.480 --> 3:21:00.720]  seems completely fine but what i have noticed that all these command and control precedents
[3:21:00.720 --> 3:21:05.200]  being set up you know if you can they just closed down hockey uh just now a few minutes ago uh the
[3:21:05.200 --> 3:21:08.800]  nba yesterday you know can shut these games down for something else i was just talking to one of the
[3:21:08.800 --> 3:21:13.360]  crew here who has family in mexico in monorail they're just closing school no one knows that yet
[3:21:13.360 --> 3:21:18.000]  we're about to write an article on it i mean the the distressing thing about it for lovers of individual
[3:21:18.000 --> 3:21:22.560]  liberty is that this is clearly a precedent setting right if you can close down the nba for this then
[3:21:22.560 --> 3:21:26.560]  you can do it more easily in the future and any group wants to shut down the world economy they
[3:21:26.560 --> 3:21:31.200]  just release a novel virus is all over every two to four years in time of the elections just peculiar
[3:21:31.200 --> 3:21:36.560]  that is you know um the democrats so who do you think the prime suspect is for this uh well
[3:21:36.560 --> 3:21:41.600]  democrats got the recession they wanted the recession that's the only possible thing that
[3:21:41.600 --> 3:21:45.360]  could get donald trump out of office and they're openly celebrating it yeah i mean that should
[3:21:45.360 --> 3:21:49.280]  end their party forever they can't get the guy out of office with a candidate they can't get
[3:21:49.280 --> 3:21:52.480]  him out of office on the fact they can't get him out of office on the merits it seems to be the
[3:21:52.480 --> 3:21:56.160]  only thing they can get him out of office with uh is a recession so that's what they're trying
[3:21:56.160 --> 3:22:01.360]  now so headline milo unopolis democrats bet everything on coronavirus of course i mean
[3:22:01.360 --> 3:22:05.520]  it's the best thing that's ever happened or democrats love love corona said i love new
[3:22:05.520 --> 3:22:10.560]  york i love i don't listen i've no doubt there is some kind of flu i mean coronavirus has been on
[3:22:10.560 --> 3:22:16.480]  the back of of bottles of antiseptic or whatever for three years already is it has been existed
[3:22:16.480 --> 3:22:23.440]  for a while you know but but but but the the um clearly the hysteria is manufactured and clearly
[3:22:23.440 --> 3:22:29.360]  it is serving one particular side of the political aisle who are going in ham on it for electoral
[3:22:29.360 --> 3:22:33.120]  reasons clearly that's the democrats clearly the media and the democrats have invested interest
[3:22:33.120 --> 3:22:38.320]  in the country shutting down ahead of the next presidential election it's obvious isn't it you
[3:22:38.320 --> 3:22:43.680]  know they pulled that up it's been on bottles of stuff for years yeah yeah because it's because
[3:22:43.680 --> 3:22:48.000]  it's uh it's uh as far as i can tell it's a man-made thing everyone's known about for a while it's
[3:22:48.000 --> 3:22:51.840]  just you know who reads the back of these bottles right uh but someone noticed somewhere somehow
[3:22:51.840 --> 3:22:56.640]  that this thing is this thing is on the back of uh well china used it as a way when they were losing
[3:22:56.640 --> 3:23:01.920]  in taiwan and domestically to well i just wonder when the coronavirus thing peters out will hong kong
[3:23:01.920 --> 3:23:06.640]  still be there uh you know just suddenly we're not hearing about these protesters anymore that's
[3:23:06.640 --> 3:23:12.320]  quite convenient i'm just wondering whether by the way i had a report that the stars virus same
[3:23:12.320 --> 3:23:17.520]  family as a coronavirus is killed by nano silver we were saying that was 13 years ago they were
[3:23:17.520 --> 3:23:22.720]  saying that they don't want to sing it now you just pointed out that disinfectant says it on it
[3:23:22.720 --> 3:23:26.480]  right and also the other thing is even if it's all true even if everything they're saying is true
[3:23:26.480 --> 3:23:31.760]  about it it's just not it doesn't really seem to me to be that incredibly serious the death rate's
[3:23:31.760 --> 3:23:37.120]  really low i mean the death rate is but the hysteria is very the hysteria is the story
[3:23:37.120 --> 3:23:43.040]  and that's what will damage p i mean no i just i got a um i got a text just the other day from
[3:23:43.040 --> 3:23:48.960]  my dental hygienist uh who says that she is uh about to be put off work for two months because
[3:23:48.960 --> 3:23:54.480]  the dentist she works for uh is closing the surgery she doesn't have um uh she's you know
[3:23:54.480 --> 3:23:58.000]  she's not like an employee with health benefits whatever she's a self-employed so it's a lockdown
[3:23:58.000 --> 3:24:02.880]  of this is going to hurt people really hurt what bible verses it were the wicked flea when
[3:24:02.880 --> 3:24:07.760]  none pursues because yeah first it was a 15 death rate in the land's a study then they go oh it's
[3:24:07.760 --> 3:24:12.800]  actually five now it's two now it's one now it's now it's like nought point and you have to be you
[3:24:12.800 --> 3:24:18.800]  have to be 96 years old and have like 50 years of pre-existing lung conditions and oh and you
[3:24:18.800 --> 3:24:23.760]  need hiv and then maybe you'll die like give me a break but what happened with hiv because remember
[3:24:23.760 --> 3:24:27.760]  a lot of folks said early on it was all a hoax and the drugs were killing you they said that and
[3:24:27.760 --> 3:24:34.800]  then now it's like oh oh magic's fine everybody's fine they said that they found a a slice of hiv
[3:24:34.800 --> 3:24:39.760]  in it which suggested that it was indeed made in a lab and the delivery system right and exactly
[3:24:39.760 --> 3:24:45.600]  and that there was this there was a um a a slice of hiv in it which is how it infected people and
[3:24:45.600 --> 3:24:51.040]  how it was you know it was it was so infectious and and and that indeed it was patented by an
[3:24:51.040 --> 3:24:56.480]  organization that was funded by us and uk foundations some of these foundations that seem to be dedicated
[3:24:56.480 --> 3:25:00.960]  to the reduction of global population well it's kind of like that's flying around now i mean it's
[3:25:00.960 --> 3:25:07.200]  like you try you try so hard not to indulge in what they always call you know the the right far
[3:25:07.200 --> 3:25:11.760]  right conspiracy theory whatever but you do try you try to be like no come on come on come on
[3:25:11.760 --> 3:25:17.360]  and then you look at it and you're just like well that's my thing is that tabletop exercise 15 65
[3:25:17.360 --> 3:25:21.120]  million dad two months four and now they've got it they've got it they've got the vaccine the
[3:25:21.120 --> 3:25:26.000]  patented virus and now bill of motivation sitting out the kits to create hysteria it's like this
[3:25:26.000 --> 3:25:31.440]  is the real dr evil here yeah it's just it's just another flu and a lot but as i say that the real
[3:25:31.440 --> 3:25:36.640]  story here is of course who is leveraging it and for what right well i want to say this if i went
[3:25:36.640 --> 3:25:41.760]  in a whole hog and said into the world obviously i got so more product people need turmeric and and
[3:25:41.760 --> 3:25:46.480]  coital silver and you know high quality products anyway for their lives and sure it's probably
[3:25:46.480 --> 3:25:50.800]  bad for some sure get geared up and ready but a lot of folks i know are actually mad that i'm not like
[3:25:50.800 --> 3:25:55.200]  just it's the end of the world run for the hell tell yourselves it's all over that must be a new
[3:25:55.200 --> 3:25:59.440]  experience for you people telling you that they're upset that you're being too but don't worry
[3:25:59.440 --> 3:26:06.400]  i'm hyping it that's the end of the world i i don't know has that happened often no it's never
[3:26:06.400 --> 3:26:10.400]  happened before let me ask you this Milo Milo novels here in studio is new book coming out
[3:26:10.400 --> 3:26:15.440]  why do you think they are hyping it so much right now then i've never seen hype like this well it
[3:26:15.440 --> 3:26:19.680]  seems obvious to me that if people are hurting if people are losing their jobs if people are having
[3:26:19.680 --> 3:26:24.160]  to dig into their kids college funds to make rent or the rest of it it's more likely to create a
[3:26:24.160 --> 3:26:30.800]  a volatile electoral environment for the president and i was saying that six weeks ago democrats now
[3:26:30.800 --> 3:26:35.520]  go hallelujah this is going to get trumped i'm going to play the clips you've seen it Milo yeah
[3:26:35.520 --> 3:26:40.240]  how bad is it going to get well so they say that because they've just changed the testing
[3:26:41.520 --> 3:26:46.560]  conditions you know so before you had to say oh i had some travel to china or i need confirmed
[3:26:46.560 --> 3:26:51.360]  contact with someone who had the virus now that they're trying now that more test kits available
[3:26:51.360 --> 3:26:56.240]  to give one to pretty much anybody who wants one so you're probably going to see an enormous
[3:26:56.240 --> 3:27:01.840]  explosion over the next week or two of new confirmed cases of coronavirus because more
[3:27:01.840 --> 3:27:06.400]  people are now eligible to have the tests uh after that that's going to create the real estate
[3:27:06.400 --> 3:27:09.680]  i think so and then i mean we haven't seen anything yet i mean this is nothing sports games
[3:27:09.680 --> 3:27:13.440]  cancelled who cares but i've been able to get on a plane here and home and no problem that means
[3:27:13.440 --> 3:27:18.160]  society is basically functioning okay when do you think lockdown hits three weeks four weeks
[3:27:18.160 --> 3:27:21.760]  a week or two i guess i mean i went downtown austin last night was fine everybody was out
[3:27:21.760 --> 3:27:25.280]  drinking partying had a good time there's still less traffic and i can go in restaurants i couldn't
[3:27:25.280 --> 3:27:29.600]  get in before but yeah yeah no i got a reservation in new york i wouldn't have been able to get a
[3:27:29.600 --> 3:27:34.640]  few weeks ago actually a couple days ago but but i mean that that's it so far but you know once
[3:27:34.640 --> 3:27:40.480]  once the planes are grounded then you have uh you know as a country that is no longer functioning
[3:27:40.480 --> 3:27:44.800]  as a and you know they're gonna have a few cities shut down as a test case right i mean that's you
[3:27:44.800 --> 3:27:49.760]  know there's not like seattle the thing that worries me yeah so the west coast places the
[3:27:49.760 --> 3:27:55.840]  thing that worries me is um you know new jersey instituting this state law where it's spreading
[3:27:55.840 --> 3:28:00.560]  misinformation about the coronavirus is now an offense that can land you in in in jail that's
[3:28:00.560 --> 3:28:05.920]  totally arbitrary that's exactly exactly i mean what do the police know is is you know are you
[3:28:05.920 --> 3:28:09.920]  telling me the police what is the police's standard of evidence what's their reference
[3:28:09.920 --> 3:28:15.360]  point is it cnn is it cbs like where is it the new york times well you just told me i didn't know
[3:28:15.360 --> 3:28:20.240]  new jersey it is now going to be an offense in new jersey punishable with jail terms for
[3:28:20.240 --> 3:28:25.440]  spreading misinformation about the coronavirus and it's and i'm sitting here thinking okay so i'm
[3:28:25.440 --> 3:28:31.680]  spec you know snopes is going to be the source because i'm sitting i'm sitting here like speculating
[3:28:31.680 --> 3:28:35.120]  on your show about what i think is really going on am i going to go home and get arrested am i going
[3:28:35.120 --> 3:28:40.240]  to get thrown in jail talk about that with mylo because folks let's say the virus isn't a big deal
[3:28:41.440 --> 3:28:47.360]  the hysteria and the response is in georgia has an old prison camp they're using a state park they're

[3:34:29.040 --> 3:34:32.640]  let's talk about roger stone because it's not just about roger stone who's his important guy a great
[3:34:32.640 --> 3:34:38.320]  guy a gagged and shut down you were at the trial we covered it yes now the judge is trying to suppress
[3:34:38.320 --> 3:34:42.480]  that she rigged the jury she's got a lawyer for the jurors to suppress what they did you really
[3:34:42.480 --> 3:34:46.560]  knocked out of the park i watched it last night when you were on the war with oan shoyard you've
[3:34:46.560 --> 3:34:51.360]  written about it uh at your great website i tell folks how they can find that censor dot tv we also
[3:34:51.360 --> 3:34:56.480]  have your own website the trial of roger stone it's amazing well thanks yeah so you can find the
[3:34:56.480 --> 3:35:02.960]  book it's on amazon or you can go to stone trial dot com and uh what i what i've done is i've tried
[3:35:02.960 --> 3:35:08.880]  to explain how the story of roger stone's trial has larger ramifications for american jurisprudence
[3:35:08.880 --> 3:35:16.080]  for freedom and whatnot this is a very disturbing case of left-wing uh tactics attack tactics left
[3:35:16.080 --> 3:35:22.400]  wing attack vectors you know cancel culture and the um deliberate misrepresentation of jokes
[3:35:22.400 --> 3:35:27.120]  of serious statements and all the kinds of various forms of cultural warfare that the left has been
[3:35:27.680 --> 3:35:34.320]  engaged in have now shifted they've metastasized into legal strategies too so now you're not just
[3:35:34.320 --> 3:35:40.720]  lawfare they went up it's prison fair indeed but but the the what they've done to us to roger to
[3:35:40.720 --> 3:35:46.960]  gavin and people like that uh trying to edge us out of the national conversation is now appearing
[3:35:46.960 --> 3:35:54.240]  in courtrooms as well uh i've had uh i've been able to look at some sealed documents in this case
[3:35:54.240 --> 3:35:59.760]  which are not available to the public um and the makeup of the jury which i talk about extensive
[3:35:59.760 --> 3:36:04.720]  length in the book uh and and this is the only example of anywhere you can find it you can't
[3:36:04.720 --> 3:36:10.240]  see it on television none of the other reporters will tell you anything about it but the um i tell
[3:36:10.240 --> 3:36:15.920]  you in great detail in this book about precisely who and exactly uh you know what the political
[3:36:15.920 --> 3:36:19.280]  political and by the way they i know you were there the whole time i told you were given that
[3:36:19.280 --> 3:36:23.520]  they only leaked one of the jurors we exposed the first one the first foreman that worked for
[3:36:23.520 --> 3:36:28.240]  obama and or hasn't worked for moeller you got another one and now it came out so i'm proud that
[3:36:28.240 --> 3:36:32.480]  you got this i've been able to see that but not authorized to put it out the whole damn jury was
[3:36:32.480 --> 3:36:36.640]  democrat operatives and then and then why are they letting you put it in the book but roger and all
[3:36:36.640 --> 3:36:39.840]  them are scared to put it out well roger can't speak about the case which is why it's important
[3:36:39.840 --> 3:36:43.920]  that we make clear that he hasn't he's not involved hasn't spoken to us he hasn't his lawyers won't
[3:36:43.920 --> 3:36:51.760]  speak to us um but why doesn't he this woman's a joke well she is um in the book you'll you'll
[3:36:51.760 --> 3:36:55.760]  learn a bit about her history and about where she comes from she worked for a law firm that you
[3:36:55.760 --> 3:36:59.760]  know one of the partners was a guy who would who was previously a politician who got shellacked by
[3:36:59.760 --> 3:37:04.000]  roger stone uh in a political operation there's all kinds of stuff in the past that you'll learn
[3:37:04.000 --> 3:37:09.760]  about uh in the book uh the trial of roger stone so she judge amy berman jackson has a giant hard

[3:37:49.920 --> 3:37:53.600]  on what you think of someone here's the difference you're supposed to grovel to her i'm not gonna
[3:37:53.600 --> 3:37:58.720]  kiss her ass uh i have to tread carefully because i don't want to get hauled in for contempt of
[3:37:58.720 --> 3:38:04.080]  court because you better know here's who she's really she's not a bitch she's a purple-butted
[3:38:04.080 --> 3:38:08.720]  baboon i like that i like that let's stick with that let's stick with that she's a purple-butted
[3:38:08.720 --> 3:38:15.200]  baboon uh so you can you can find out what some of the uh the some of the worst offenses of this
[3:38:15.200 --> 3:38:22.320]  purple-butted buffoon a baboon uh you are in the true baboonery she's engaged in baboonery
[3:38:22.320 --> 3:38:28.640]  um anyway um on a on a serious note obviously um we've had to piece this story together from
[3:38:28.640 --> 3:38:32.320]  documents and interviews and all the rest of it because roger and his lawyers can't contact the
[3:38:32.320 --> 3:38:37.520]  outside world they've been gagged violation of their first amendment and not just that um he's
[3:38:37.520 --> 3:38:45.200]  also had other uh uh bill of rights uh amendment rights curtailed as well you could argue very
[3:38:45.200 --> 3:38:50.960]  persuasively that he's had his right to uh not you know to to to to you know the illegal search
[3:38:50.960 --> 3:38:55.600]  and seizure has been violated you could argue that his right to a fair trial has been violated and
[3:38:55.600 --> 3:39:00.080]  indeed i do argue that in this book and the worry for the for the for all of us at the roger stone
[3:39:00.080 --> 3:39:04.400]  trial is that the president for the super railroading well it because they admit this is a beta test
[3:39:04.400 --> 3:39:09.280]  for everybody exactly like they'd be platforming you taking your PayPal mine too exactly when i
[3:39:09.280 --> 3:39:13.520]  see democrats the street they go we're gonna put you in prison ever yeah i'm like for what you're
[3:39:13.520 --> 3:39:20.480]  going to present well now we know now we know uh the answer is selective prosecution the uh deliberate
[3:39:20.480 --> 3:39:27.760]  and uh mendacious misrep misrepresentation of jokes and and and tom foolery as witness intimidation
[3:39:27.760 --> 3:39:34.640]  and violent threats oh she says when i call her a purple butted baboon that she's that's intimidation
[3:39:35.360 --> 3:39:39.600]  well she's a public figure doing horrible things of course she's a purple that's not even a nice
[3:39:39.600 --> 3:39:44.400]  enough name well see federal judges exist in this um in this peculiar realm of untouched well they
[3:39:44.400 --> 3:39:51.040]  wear the black cloak where they're the giant purple butt must be covered like sorry one of the things
[3:39:51.040 --> 3:39:55.440]  i talk about in the book is how um and you and i think and maybe gavin mcginnis are the three
[3:39:55.440 --> 3:40:01.360]  best examples of this you can't speak satirically uh or in a comedic and light-hearted no because
[3:40:01.360 --> 3:40:07.040]  you're right it's not her ass it looks like a baboon but it's her face well i i read the book
[3:40:07.040 --> 3:40:13.440]  uh i i i you can't speak in this sort of satirical or just plain disrespectful fashion about anybody
[3:40:13.440 --> 3:40:18.160]  on the left and have your remarks just treated as what they are which is just satirical tom foolery
[3:40:18.160 --> 3:40:25.040]  uh and a bit of fun you can't do that um uh and and and expect to get away with it in the way that
[3:40:25.040 --> 3:40:29.760]  you know someone like bill ma or john stewart can be both a satirist and a serious political
[3:40:29.760 --> 3:40:33.360]  commentator yeah he can say whatever he wants through every once but we can't it's because it
[3:40:33.360 --> 3:40:39.840]  was obviously she doesn't look a baboon but that's too pretty i have no comment to make on your uh
[3:40:39.840 --> 3:40:45.120]  your repulsive and disgusting and now you're now you're angry at baboons are you saying baboon
[3:40:45.120 --> 3:40:50.080]  one of god creatures esteemed federal judge when i looked at a baboon's ass when i was a kid i said
[3:40:50.080 --> 3:40:55.920]  why did god make that this respect what is that this respected member of federal tradition who does
[3:40:55.920 --> 3:41:02.000]  not deserve for all of her years of diligent work on the bench why did god give a woman a face
[3:41:02.000 --> 3:41:09.600]  to the baboon this kind of of ugly rhetoric from alex james well i pissed i i don't know i pissed on
[3:41:09.600 --> 3:41:15.360]  the king of england the queen of england and and and this judge i mean who is she she's dishonorable
[3:41:15.360 --> 3:41:19.840]  well that she is somebody i do believe that she's dishonorable and i think that i'm entitled to say
[3:41:19.840 --> 3:41:25.440]  so and she is somebody who obama tried very hard to have appointed and now we know why because the
[3:41:25.440 --> 3:41:31.760]  answer uh well because the left at least does uh and and and this is somebody who you know she
[3:41:31.760 --> 3:41:38.560]  she's the one who threw out the case uh uh when two parents tried to bring a case uh against hillary
[3:41:38.560 --> 3:41:44.480]  over bengasi she's the one who um threw out a case the catholic church brought because they said that
[3:41:44.480 --> 3:41:50.720]  obama care mandates it requiring employers to include a contraception uh he's a special judge
[3:41:50.720 --> 3:41:56.240]  that covers up corruption and that gets that they assign all the cases to she's certainly somebody
[3:41:56.240 --> 3:42:00.080]  for whom federal prosecutors go judge shopping and try to lock in because they know they'll
[3:42:00.080 --> 3:42:04.640]  get the result and you're right calling her a baboon but lets her off easy it kind of does
[3:42:04.640 --> 3:42:10.560]  because if you if you mean i apologize if you merely he's not good enough if you merely uh go for
[3:42:10.560 --> 3:42:14.320]  her physical appearance and i'm not going to say that i don't do that at all in the book there are
[3:42:14.320 --> 3:42:18.320]  moments where i am disablaging about how she looks and you can look forward to those in chapter three
[3:42:18.320 --> 3:42:24.480]  four and seven but um it kind of does let her off the hook because there are serious questions about
[3:42:24.480 --> 3:42:31.120]  what i don't want to say it have the power she does i actually i'm not into bestiality but i do
[3:42:31.120 --> 3:42:37.600]  like mr ed and she looks like mr ed she looks like she's been left out in the sun like the face
[3:42:37.600 --> 3:42:42.640]  has just melted a little bit and then and then hardened again when she's been brought back in out
[3:42:42.640 --> 3:42:48.160]  out of the out of the race actually look at her oh you see what i mean slightly she's you know what
[3:42:48.160 --> 3:42:53.120]  she looks a little bit like she looks a little bit like um a parent i'm not supposed to be biased
[3:42:53.120 --> 3:42:56.800]  but i'm gonna tell you all now if you haven't tried turbo force you need to try it i've tried

[3:48:01.440 --> 3:48:06.400]  now gonna have a serious segment a serious segment don't talk about your book because i've already
[3:48:06.400 --> 3:48:13.040]  read part of it okay i just want to say that my leonopoulos's new book the trial of roger stone
[3:48:13.040 --> 3:48:17.760]  is more than just the trial of roger stone is the trial of america's basic liberties
[3:48:17.760 --> 3:48:24.640]  and is a incredible tour de force exposing the modern 21st century witch hunt that is an enemy
[3:48:24.640 --> 3:48:29.440]  of every free man and woman across the world and it's a must read well i very much appreciate
[3:48:29.440 --> 3:48:32.480]  you saying that and that will probably appear on the back cover in the next couple of weeks
[3:48:32.480 --> 3:48:36.080]  it's not as good as tucker carlson you just said it very succinctly tell people what carlson says
[3:48:36.080 --> 3:48:41.920]  yeah so uh well tucker carlson if you have seen him on fox news uh said uh read this book it's
[3:48:41.920 --> 3:48:46.080]  a warning um and what the book is basically warning that's what he's saying people go when
[3:48:46.080 --> 3:48:50.240]  they're attacking me i'm like i can handle it i actually kind of like it i'm a sick person but
[3:48:50.240 --> 3:48:55.360]  when they're doing this to roger or me or you they're gonna set the precedent for you people
[3:48:55.360 --> 3:49:00.160]  asked me two years ago with totally platforming they go how are you taking i said uh you know i'm
[3:49:00.160 --> 3:49:03.920]  the test case they're coming for you next it's already gotten you that's right and they go oh
[3:49:03.920 --> 3:49:08.480]  really i'm like do you understand they're coming for you that's right so uh in the book i do talk
[3:49:08.480 --> 3:49:14.880]  about uh some of this i talk about um what this case is setting up for the future uh the mechanics
[3:49:14.880 --> 3:49:19.520]  and precedents that it's establishing and also about the various characters that are involved
[3:49:19.520 --> 3:49:23.360]  in this if you've heard about the moolah report um there are guys that were really sort of the power
[3:49:23.360 --> 3:49:28.480]  behind it's guy andrew weissman and various others and i talk about a bunch of just rat like rubbing
[3:49:28.480 --> 3:49:32.720]  their hands they are they are you're right i'm gonna get him i mean and then um i also talk in
[3:49:32.720 --> 3:49:36.480]  the book but didn't they overestimate they thought they would win what do they do now they've lost
[3:49:36.480 --> 3:49:42.880]  change the subject to corona virus well maybe uh so then i talk about um uh the thing that
[3:49:42.880 --> 3:49:47.040]  perhaps you haven't heard anywhere else which is the roger stone that i know which is the real guy
[3:49:47.040 --> 3:49:51.840]  that some of us have the pleasure of knowing privately uh you know the the um the actual
[3:49:51.840 --> 3:49:55.440]  real man behind the the headlines which brings home to you i think the kind of appalling
[3:49:56.000 --> 3:50:01.280]  abuse of of prosecutorial power that this is describe the real roger stone briefly because
[3:50:01.280 --> 3:50:06.240]  people don't they don't i mean that was you just i would say really smart kind of classical liberal
[3:50:06.240 --> 3:50:13.360]  feeling guy uh who also what is the political thing about roger he he is one of the last genuine
[3:50:14.320 --> 3:50:19.120]  iconoclasts who's also able to operate in mainstream politics and by that what i mean
[3:50:19.120 --> 3:50:23.680]  is you can never predict his position on any particular issue but when it's very he's very
[3:50:23.680 --> 3:50:28.240]  nuanced when yeah when you find them all out that he starts to make sense as a person so people
[3:50:28.240 --> 3:50:31.840]  are surprised for instance to find out that roger stone has throughout his career been one of the
[3:50:32.640 --> 3:50:38.480]  most strident defenders of animal rights of anybody on the political right or sexual rights
[3:50:38.480 --> 3:50:43.840]  he's also a sexual libertine he's also very libertarian in matters of but but he's actually
[3:50:43.840 --> 3:50:47.840]  that in action that's why they fear him well he lives his principles and one of the things
[3:50:47.840 --> 3:50:52.960]  i talk about in the book is the fact that although he may come across as uh as a man who lives in
[3:50:52.960 --> 3:50:57.920]  artifice with the suits and the cocktails and all the rest of it actually he is living the real roger
[3:50:57.920 --> 3:51:04.960]  stone it's the people in the bland um navy blue suits who are they're not flamboyant who are dressing
[3:51:04.960 --> 3:51:11.440]  in a particular kind of uniform to cover up something um ugly and mendacious about themselves
[3:51:11.440 --> 3:51:15.680]  exactly he's admitting to you that they are the ones who are pretending he's admitting to you he's
[3:51:15.680 --> 3:51:19.600]  flamboyant exactly he's showing you who he is and the thing about roger is you know you can't
[3:51:19.600 --> 3:51:23.760]  predict his positions and you can't generalize about him either and i think it's so important in
[3:51:23.760 --> 3:51:29.040]  a in a in an era of stultifying political conformity where everyone sounds the same and
[3:51:29.040 --> 3:51:34.560]  everyone's up to the same terrible terrible stuff behind the scenes that there's a guy who is what
[3:51:34.560 --> 3:51:38.640]  he says he is and let me tell you roger stone story since you get to this um
[3:51:40.800 --> 3:51:44.400]  he wore this giant cowboy hat to go shooting like the biggest one i've ever saw in his
[3:51:44.400 --> 3:51:47.680]  he goes i'm just having fun i like to like whatever the archetype is go with it but i
[3:51:47.680 --> 3:51:51.520]  got feeling better he's like i'll talk about god and stuff at dinner and yes now god then he's
[3:51:51.520 --> 3:51:54.960]  trying to say no i i agree it's god it's the fight against the evil one right something more about
[3:51:54.960 --> 3:51:59.440]  god so what he says is except that jesus christ is his savior that's not fake with roger no it
[3:51:59.440 --> 3:52:04.240]  isn't and you know it's not a surprise either um that almost all of the people who have been attacked
[3:52:04.240 --> 3:52:11.680]  the most vigorously by the left are god fearing people who are either are christians and it doesn't
[3:52:11.680 --> 3:52:16.480]  mean they're perfect but no no no but they're either christians or they are at least hugely
[3:52:16.480 --> 3:52:21.600]  respectful of christianity it is not so why is there such an example of christianity well because
[3:52:21.600 --> 3:52:25.600]  christianity is the fundamental underpinning of western civilization it isn't freedom it isn't
[3:52:25.600 --> 3:52:30.800]  democracy it isn't capitalism it's christianity that's it it is ultimately for all of its faults
[3:52:30.800 --> 3:52:34.480]  and it has gone terribly i got told by the new york times like three years ago we're going to
[3:52:34.480 --> 3:52:38.800]  destroy you in a private meeting i had to you know non-disclosure stuff they're they're representative
[3:52:38.800 --> 3:52:42.240]  we want you to stop defending christianity yeah we want you to accept islam
[3:52:42.240 --> 3:52:48.640]  oh yeah no no way to come out of goods guns i want you to accept drag queen story time which
[3:52:48.640 --> 3:52:54.240]  means pedophilia and i just said no no no no it just brings out it brings out the queer basher in
[3:52:54.240 --> 3:53:00.000]  me when i see drag queen story time i just i just want to end them all well since when do gay dudes
[3:53:00.000 --> 3:53:03.120]  want to run out and like have kids that their lives i never heard of that well i thought you
[3:53:03.120 --> 3:53:07.920]  know i just so ashamed of my fellow homosexuals when we told all they wanted is just to get married
[3:53:07.920 --> 3:53:13.440]  and be like everybody else and then within a year they're putting sex offenders into into kids libraries
[3:53:13.440 --> 3:53:17.520]  anyway let's get back to this no no no but i gotta leave town but you should you should come back
[3:53:17.520 --> 3:53:21.280]  and talk about that because i would love to i will come back i will come back i'm i'm heading out
[3:53:21.280 --> 3:53:24.960]  today but i'll definitely come back and talk at length about drag queen story time particularly
[3:53:24.960 --> 3:53:29.760]  who's funding it um because it's a very interesting story about how all this emerged so i will do that
[3:53:29.760 --> 3:53:34.080]  on another occasion um the last thing i want to say about roger and about the book is when i when i
[3:53:34.080 --> 3:53:40.240]  explore who he is and you find these unusual and unexpected things in his biography for instance
[3:53:40.240 --> 3:53:45.760]  that he has worked tirelessly and not just by giving money but with his time he'd criminalized
[3:53:45.760 --> 3:53:51.200]  drugs exactly to free blacks from prison he's the one that got clump it wasn't i'm sorry it wasn't
[3:53:51.200 --> 3:53:56.960]  kanye west wife he helped that was roger 40 years ago right and also um head injuries for nfl players
[3:53:56.960 --> 3:54:00.240]  which is something that almost exclusively affects african-americans so there are all
[3:54:00.240 --> 3:54:04.800]  kinds of things about roger that you probably don't know um that you may be surprised and
[3:54:04.800 --> 3:54:10.240]  pleased to find out about and you will be appalled and angered by the injustice of this but i think
[3:54:10.240 --> 3:54:14.400]  i think they've really jumped that jumped the shark screwed the pitch whatever i think they've
[3:54:14.400 --> 3:54:20.000]  overreached by allowing a four person who is a former let me tell you just very briefly about
[3:54:20.000 --> 3:54:23.760]  the jury there's a there's that you've got this four person everybody knows the name is now is
[3:54:23.760 --> 3:54:28.800]  now public uh tamika hark uh she's in my book set cousins uh outed himself in the page of the
[3:54:28.800 --> 3:54:34.000]  washington post so we can give both of those names um allowing a four person who had run oh yeah
[3:54:34.000 --> 3:54:38.560]  they out themselves the washington post and then i'm not supposed to say their name right right
[3:54:38.560 --> 3:54:42.960]  and then uh they they themselves have come out in public but then there's something like anyway
[3:54:42.960 --> 3:54:47.840]  um but but even when you step beyond this four person who was a congressional dem a democratic
[3:54:47.840 --> 3:54:51.600]  congressional candidate let me tell you just very briefly some things about the rest of the jury
[3:54:51.600 --> 3:54:56.800]  in the abstract in a way that won't get you in any legal trouble five out of 12 were either lawyers
[3:54:56.800 --> 3:55:02.000]  or married to lawyers two of the jury members had worked for democratic senators one of the jury
[3:55:02.000 --> 3:55:08.240]  members had worked for a democratic congressman uh all of them when they listed the news sources
[3:55:08.240 --> 3:55:13.600]  that they regularly consumed listed left-wing news sources so i'm glad they could get in the book
[3:55:13.600 --> 3:55:18.560]  i couldn't get them i couldn't get people out with him come on about this you're you're i'm glad
[3:55:18.560 --> 3:55:22.160]  you've got the scoop you've got to stay in town or come back on the show tomorrow next week because
[3:55:22.160 --> 3:55:26.720]  now i've read only part of the book i had to read the rest of it the the judge thought trump will be
[3:55:26.720 --> 3:55:31.600]  removed by obis from now they went with a totally rigged jury this is unprecedented in the rigging
[3:55:31.600 --> 3:55:36.560]  of juries let me be really honest with you i have always been on the fence about some of the more
[3:55:36.560 --> 3:55:40.720]  ultray you know what they call conspiracy theories or theories or whatever the wild it's all controlled
[3:55:40.720 --> 3:55:45.680]  so yeah yes to be i took sometimes you know the world government stuff makes me go uh no they said
[3:55:45.680 --> 3:55:50.320]  i was bill hex i started questioning right i was like but i gotta tell you i was sitting in that
[3:55:50.320 --> 3:55:56.080]  courtroom i was sitting there in that courtroom in washington dc watching and unfold before me the
[3:55:56.080 --> 3:56:02.800]  lynching yes uh but but it absolutely undeniable not just a miscarriage of justice this is not
[3:56:02.800 --> 3:56:08.000]  just a well-wrote we're used to uh we're used to bias judges we're used to bias juries we're used
[3:56:08.000 --> 3:56:13.120]  to all this stuff but here's here's really the important thing you have to grasp um there's no
[3:56:13.120 --> 3:56:18.320]  way that this jury could have could have been assembled by random computer selection i cannot
[3:56:18.320 --> 3:56:23.840]  oh no it was that was a heavy democrat operating i do not believe it and when you look at the jury's
[3:56:23.840 --> 3:56:29.440]  answers and i gotta tell you as well i've seen the original questionnaires um one of those
[3:56:29.440 --> 3:56:34.080]  questionnaires the handwriting changes halfway through and it's not just like oh well maybe you
[3:56:34.080 --> 3:56:39.040]  know uh maybe you got that wrong the the direction of the check marks in the box is flipped sure what
[3:56:39.040 --> 3:56:43.840]  this does is right hand if they got away with this rigging they were gonna i duplicate it like
[3:56:43.840 --> 3:56:50.080]  henry ford's assembly line and do it nationwide the undeniable implication of this is that the
[3:56:50.080 --> 3:56:54.480]  jurors were being coached through their questionnaire answers because somebody else at some point even
[3:56:54.480 --> 3:56:58.960]  handed the piece of paper over and in thinking that this would never uh you know leave the orbit of
[3:56:58.960 --> 3:57:02.960]  the court and and in addition to that and now the judge is fighting in addition to suppress that
[3:57:02.960 --> 3:57:06.080]  big release one of the things that's most remarkable about this case is how much of it's
[3:57:06.080 --> 3:57:09.840]  under sealed despite the fact that it is an extraordinary it is a case of extraordinary
[3:57:09.840 --> 3:57:14.480]  time tell folks the name of the book again it's the trial of roger stone you can find it at amazon
