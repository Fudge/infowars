[00:00.000 --> 00:14.160]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.160 --> 00:32.080]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones welcome ladies and gentlemen
[00:32.080 --> 00:37.800]  welcome thank you for joining us on this very important Friday broadcast we're gonna be live
[00:37.800 --> 00:47.160]  here for the next four hours it is the 14th of November 2008 seems as if 2008 just began a
[00:47.160 --> 00:54.040]  couple days ago and when we blink our eyes or even in the twinkling of an eye it will be
[00:54.040 --> 01:06.280]  2009 2009 and we will have the president-elect Barack H. Obama become the new Caesar the new
[01:06.280 --> 01:16.640]  figurehead of the collapsing Anglo-American Empire but it's been collapsed by design into the
[01:16.640 --> 01:24.960]  greater world empire openly run by the banks of the planet the few select families that own them
[01:24.960 --> 01:31.000]  even people in our own alternative media movement most of them keep saying the bailout is failing
[01:31.000 --> 01:39.200]  it's not working it's it's working beautifully it's a takeover the war on drugs triple the heroin
[01:39.200 --> 01:43.600]  double the cocaine more people in prison more cops getting killed more citizens getting killed
[01:43.600 --> 01:52.280]  more robberies more crime it's working beautifully public schools aren't broken they're not broken
[01:52.280 --> 02:00.560]  they're working exactly as they were designed to the border isn't broken it's meant to be wide open
[02:00.560 --> 02:09.440]  it's all meant to keep slaves in they want more slaves to come so we'll break all of this down
[02:09.440 --> 02:16.080]  for you today Phil Berg is joining us we had him on a few times during the campaign but now I want
[02:16.080 --> 02:21.320]  to I want to learn directly from him and I'm sure the listeners do exactly what happened at the
[02:21.320 --> 02:25.920]  Supreme Court what happened at other courts what happened to other lawsuits pointing out that they
[02:25.920 --> 02:30.840]  would not release the original birth certificate they said well it has a social security number on
[02:30.840 --> 02:43.240]  it well black that out let's see that too is a red herring because birth certificates today don't
[02:43.240 --> 02:48.240]  have social security numbers on them in the past you got a social security number when you went
[02:48.240 --> 02:53.640]  into the workforce at 14 15 16 years old I know when I've got one when I was 13 because I started
[02:53.640 --> 03:01.440]  working at a regular animal vet later I worked for small not just small but large animal vet but
[03:01.440 --> 03:09.360]  that part doesn't matter the point is I was 13 I got a job at a regular vet in Dallas part time
[03:09.360 --> 03:15.600]  someone got my social security card and it has that to prove I wasn't an illegal alien but of
[03:15.600 --> 03:21.720]  course that's all selectively enforced government gives the illegal aliens fake ID numbers fake
[03:21.720 --> 03:25.880]  social security numbers or citizens numbers that's in the Dallas morning news today yes the
[03:25.880 --> 03:37.480]  government I suddenly have ebonics speaking today the government hired illegals almost exclusively
[03:37.480 --> 03:44.480]  to build the border fence which they never built it was designed to fail as giant four foot
[03:44.480 --> 03:55.120]  walkways quote for wildlife and water to drain through it's a complete joke they're laughing at
[03:55.120 --> 04:00.600]  us can you hear them but I'll get into all of that today my mind is spinning there's so much I
[04:00.600 --> 04:06.280]  want to talk about I watched an hour while I was getting ready for the radio show today on hour
[04:06.280 --> 04:14.840]  they're ongoing right now it's absolutely riveting I watched an hour of the four hour hearings
[04:14.840 --> 04:28.840]  started at 9 a.m. this morning central I guess 10 a.m. Eastern with the subcommittee that Dennis
[04:28.840 --> 04:41.040]  Cassinich chairs with Neil cash and carry up there before him and congressman yes and others
[04:41.040 --> 04:47.320]  just tore him apart and it was some of the most amazing congressional testimony I've ever seen
[04:47.320 --> 04:54.560]  I mean it put Watergate the shame in the intensity and the importance and the reality so we're
[04:54.560 --> 04:57.520]  gonna play some clips that coming up later and I'm gonna talk about it when you get back stay
[04:57.520 --> 05:04.600]  with me hello friends this is Alex Jones I've told you for a long time it's important to be
[05:04.600 --> 05:08.760]  self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent and food
[05:08.760 --> 05:13.360]  and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll
[05:13.360 --> 05:18.200]  never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency if
[05:18.200 --> 05:22.880]  you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for a special interest
[05:22.880 --> 05:27.520]  so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email they voted to
[05:27.520 --> 05:32.160]  print eight hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the
[05:32.160 --> 05:36.880]  American and European banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your
[05:36.880 --> 05:42.280]  life savings to nothing and blast the cost of assassins particularly food beyond many Americans
[05:42.280 --> 05:47.320]  reach in pre-Nazi Germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days
[05:47.320 --> 05:52.760]  until it reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems to
[05:52.760 --> 05:57.440]  exist there may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to
[05:57.440 --> 06:01.520]  loan grocery stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but
[06:01.520 --> 06:06.120]  jack of prices to stay in business whatever happens in America we need to be prepared and
[06:06.120 --> 06:10.520]  be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of Americans have to choose between buying
[06:10.520 --> 06:15.920]  food and paying for other necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient
[06:15.920 --> 06:19.880]  get food for everybody out there listening it's very important for you to understand that by
[06:19.880 --> 06:24.200]  having a supply of storable food the government the new old order has a lot less control over you
[06:24.200 --> 06:29.160]  and so it's a mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take care
[06:29.160 --> 06:33.720]  of your family in the final equation but you you know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship

[07:09.880 --> 07:15.960]  network proudly presents the alex jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[07:26.760 --> 07:35.800]  to recount the entire saga of the quest that philbert was on trying to ferret out the real name of
[07:35.800 --> 07:43.000]  Barack Obama Barack Obama's not his name ferret out where he was really born who his father really
[07:43.000 --> 07:50.680]  is he'll be joining us coming up in the next hour live the last 30 minutes of the show of
[07:50.680 --> 07:55.680]  really interesting gentleman coming on well with ideas about how to get the word out about the
[07:55.680 --> 08:01.520]  new world order 9-11 the whole global police state pretty successful a salesman and marketer in
[08:01.520 --> 08:07.840]  his own right Daryl Rundus will be joining us for 30 minutes today by the way we have some
[08:07.840 --> 08:12.120]  really big guests next week I'll just leave it at that and you will see who's popping in on the
[08:12.120 --> 08:17.680]  show but next week is certainly going to be a very informative and of course I don't forget I
[08:17.680 --> 08:24.880]  will be live this Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. for the abbreviated Sunday edition we are here live
[08:24.880 --> 08:36.880]  6 days a week Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 3 p.m. and then back on Sundays from 4 to
[08:36.880 --> 08:48.760]  6 p.m. I have a lot of very important news in front of me today but coming up in a few minutes I
[08:48.760 --> 09:00.440]  do want to talk about the oversight committee on the economy that Dennis Kucinich now the
[09:00.440 --> 09:09.560]  Democrats have swept the House and Senate he's one of the few good Democrats and by good I
[09:09.560 --> 09:15.400]  described some of his policies but he's the real deal and he does fight tyranny and he voted against
[09:15.400 --> 09:21.760]  the bailout one of the few Democrats that did with a lot of Republicans kind of like Ron Paul's
[09:21.760 --> 09:30.880]  one of the few Republicans to vote against the war or the wars but um he had Neil Kashkari
[09:30.880 --> 09:40.520]  before him and so I watched an hour of this this morning in between reading the financial
[09:40.520 --> 09:48.960]  publications and I was almost late getting to the studio because I was still at my house where
[09:48.960 --> 09:55.280]  I get ready watching this and so I don't have the clips for you because this was just now live
[09:55.280 --> 10:01.360]  it's still ongoing and by the time I got to some of the lesser members on the committee it became
[10:01.360 --> 10:14.600]  a bit milk toast but the first three speakers Kucinich Issa and then I forget his name we'll
[10:14.600 --> 10:23.480]  pull it up the black congressman from his Cummings from Maryland he was really powerful and it
[10:23.480 --> 10:27.640]  wasn't an act the guy started getting tears in his eyes and he said look everybody's losing
[10:27.640 --> 10:32.800]  their houses in my constituency they're begging me they're begging me and Kashkari just laughed
[10:32.800 --> 10:36.840]  it off and just said look they don't get any of the money and just threw it in their face and
[10:36.840 --> 10:43.960]  said I direct you to the bill you gave us the power and Kucinich goes that's right Congress
[10:43.960 --> 10:52.840]  gave you omnipotent power but Kucinich said the contract the bill is a fraud because even though
[10:52.840 --> 10:59.400]  there's a provision in there for unlimited power and no oversight you stated in the bill that you
[10:59.400 --> 11:05.760]  were going to go in and buy up mortgages and then reduce their price and Kashkari said well
[11:05.760 --> 11:13.200]  we're not doing that now it's just unbelievable I couldn't believe that I was it was like Alex
[11:13.200 --> 11:19.880]  Jones was Dennis Kucinich Issa and Cummings I mean it's the exact questions I would have been
[11:19.880 --> 11:27.280]  asking in fact it was better questions than I would have asked probably but I mean and the way
[11:27.280 --> 11:31.040]  they just said you're not answering the question you're dancing around this you're lying how dare
[11:31.040 --> 11:37.720]  you come in here and Kashkari had this arrogant look on his face and this he was fighting back
[11:37.720 --> 11:50.120]  a smile he hits fun to them to rob people it's fun so I'm gonna cover this at the bottom of the
[11:50.120 --> 11:54.480]  hour because this is so big I don't want to just run into it with a rant I've been writing some
[11:54.480 --> 11:59.000]  notes here during the breaks of all the points I want to cover the bottom line is this the the
[11:59.000 --> 12:05.800]  bailout is not failing you got that it is doing exactly what it was meant to do it is not a bailout
[12:05.800 --> 12:17.240]  the 700 billion as I told you five weeks ago was only the beginning the real issue was the
[12:17.240 --> 12:24.960]  unlimited power it gave the Treasury and the Federal Reserve now obviously Congress could get
[12:24.960 --> 12:32.440]  tricked into passing a bill that said that black people were slaves again it wouldn't be followed
[12:32.440 --> 12:38.760]  it would be overturned it would be an unconstitutional law it would be an abhorrent law it would be
[12:38.760 --> 12:48.280]  under the organic common law the God-given rights a fraud and it's the same thing with this and
[12:48.280 --> 12:55.800]  remember the bill got up to about 600 pages 500 something with some addendums and that's why
[12:55.800 --> 12:59.960]  they had all these different versions bouncing back and forth and then they would always take
[12:59.960 --> 13:05.160]  a day to finally put it out on the internet or on the house site it was only the committees and
[13:05.160 --> 13:11.240]  they would throw Democrats they would throw Republicans out we had Bonner on we had several
[13:11.240 --> 13:15.160]  other congressmen we had the congressman on from Fort Worth Republican who was thrown out of the
[13:15.160 --> 13:20.760]  committee meetings they weren't allowed to see what was happening and they were given three hours
[13:20.760 --> 13:27.960]  after it was published on that Friday to pass it and I said folks they haven't published it
[13:27.960 --> 13:32.680]  Congress just got a copy we can't see it but I guarantee you the provisions that were in every
[13:32.680 --> 13:40.280]  previous copy for the last two weeks the provision of this can't be reviewed if the Treasury wants
[13:40.280 --> 13:45.880]  it can appoint its own group to write a report and that's exactly what they've done they hire an
[13:45.880 --> 13:50.200]  underling to write a report but if they don't want to they don't have to give anybody anything
[13:50.200 --> 13:58.600]  and guess what that was in there but see being lawyers at the Treasury Department
[13:58.600 --> 14:08.600]  and the Federal Reserve not just economists and crooks they knew they knew that it didn't matter
[14:08.600 --> 14:12.760]  if there were all these other clauses in there that Cassinage was reading to him about you've
[14:12.760 --> 14:21.000]  got to use the money to literally give the money to banks to forgive part of the mortgages
[14:23.240 --> 14:28.840]  you've got to loan this money out you must loan it out at low interest rate
[14:30.760 --> 14:40.360]  at no more than two points above prime and cost car you just said hey but did you read this section
[14:40.360 --> 14:49.160]  where it then has the sharecropper clause the fine print says if we want to all of what you've
[14:49.160 --> 14:52.920]  heard earlier is just the sense of what we're currently planning this could change at any
[14:52.920 --> 14:59.480]  time we can do whatever we want and it's unlimited we can issue tens of trillions
[15:00.520 --> 15:04.360]  you know when Bloomberg came out with their financial analyst and said well looks like
[15:04.360 --> 15:10.760]  five trillion and ron paul said yeah it it it lists about five trillion in things they want to do
[15:10.760 --> 15:15.720]  here and they've already spent five trillion now over true trillion of that as of two weeks ago
[15:15.720 --> 15:20.920]  the stuff we got monday was already a couple weeks old as of a few weeks into this you were five
[15:20.920 --> 15:27.480]  plus now but the numbers were getting here a few weeks old so it's much more now over two trillion
[15:27.480 --> 15:35.400]  is just gone and they and they say to congress you will not be told where it went
[15:36.040 --> 15:37.160]  then they go on tv
[15:39.800 --> 15:44.920]  and they have press conferences kashkari and paul said and the rest of them and just say hey
[15:47.480 --> 15:52.600]  we have total transparency total taxpayer protection every dime of this is accounted for
[15:52.600 --> 15:57.640]  and that's what you see on fox and cnn and msnbc and cnbc this morning
[16:00.360 --> 16:03.720]  i'm getting off the treadmill i'm going to go in and just research news
[16:05.160 --> 16:07.640]  but the hearings start a little after nine
[16:10.520 --> 16:16.440]  and i'm watching cnn and i noticed that kashkari spews 10 minutes of bull
[16:16.440 --> 16:21.960]  and then as soon as they cut to the chairman after the opening statement
[16:23.000 --> 16:29.400]  they never showed consensus opening statement it cuts and i go let me go to cnnbc it cuts
[16:29.400 --> 16:33.880]  let me go to fox they cut let me go to all the other channels they cut so i flip over
[16:33.880 --> 16:40.280]  to c span and there is the most incredible exposure of that criminal while he sits there
[16:40.280 --> 16:45.960]  suppressing a smile with a smart-ass look on his face needs to be arrested immediately as ron paul
[16:45.960 --> 16:51.560]  said as the congressman said a little criminal it's a good thing i wasn't there i couldn't
[16:51.560 --> 16:56.120]  control myself but the but the congressman were seething and rightfully so they were looking at
[16:56.120 --> 17:07.400]  a crook a sack of garbage so look at cnn and fox all of them they all tune away they only show
[17:09.960 --> 17:13.960]  90 plus percent of the time i rarely see them showing what a chairman has to say
[17:13.960 --> 17:20.360]  say anywhere or what the other committee people have to say riveting stuff important stuff they
[17:20.360 --> 17:25.960]  only show what the criminals in the administration and now the administration of rock obama had to
[17:25.960 --> 17:32.040]  say or the bush administration and their little corporate captains that are out running the
[17:32.040 --> 17:37.400]  different criminal operations all right i'm already getting into the story i'm going to recap
[17:37.400 --> 17:43.640]  it and go over all of it it was just unbelievable look we're playing these clips it'll probably
[17:43.640 --> 17:48.360]  be later in the show today if not i'm going to post them all on info wars dot com prison planet dot com
[17:49.720 --> 17:54.760]  paul watson's doing a story on it right now you can watch the tail end of it on c span he's recording
[17:54.760 --> 18:00.280]  it i need listeners now to go grab clips put it on the alex jones channel uh the independent youtube
[18:00.280 --> 18:05.800]  channel that puts my stuff up we need as quickly as possible it's up to you guys because erin and

[18:43.480 --> 18:47.160]  well my point is i was climbing off the stair stepper climbing off the treadmill

[23:26.120 --> 23:28.040]  when i think about the fact that
[23:28.040 --> 23:38.840]  that neil kashkari goes before a government oversight committee in the house of representatives
[23:41.160 --> 23:45.160]  and just arrogantly says we're keeping the money
[23:47.400 --> 23:54.040]  and i've never seen congressman and this wasn't an act so physically so visibly
[23:54.040 --> 24:04.440]  and physically haven't been a new word visibly and physical physically uh so visibly upset
[24:06.760 --> 24:12.120]  they were shaken well that's right you were threatened with martial law if you didn't
[24:12.120 --> 24:17.880]  pass that sucker five weeks ago and by the way for people that don't understand the branches
[24:17.880 --> 24:24.840]  of government and how oversight works uh the bush administration would not be doing any of this
[24:24.840 --> 24:33.720]  would not be um acting as minions uh as a henchman uh as um operatives for the overall
[24:33.720 --> 24:40.920]  global banking structure if they hadn't been given the op the the authorization to be doing this
[24:40.920 --> 24:50.600]  if they hadn't been given the full go ahead because they know that barack obama is coming
[24:50.600 --> 25:01.080]  into office and so if you think that barack obama is going to punish this if you think
[25:01.080 --> 25:06.200]  barack obama is going to reverse any of this you got nothing coming they wouldn't have done this
[25:06.200 --> 25:11.960]  unless they knew they had the executive secured for another four years that's what this robbery's
[25:11.960 --> 25:17.640]  all about that's why tyrants want to be tyrants it's so they can steal whatever they want your
[25:17.640 --> 25:24.440]  pension funds your land your farms your futures so they can raise taxes on you so they can control
[25:24.440 --> 25:30.040]  you so they can steal tens of billions of your own money and then give a little bit back to you
[25:30.040 --> 25:39.320]  and control your life it's feudalism it's serfdom it's domestication i mean all these poor souls
[25:39.320 --> 25:45.720]  saying barack obama is going to change things and he's already saying and i mean i wish i could hope
[25:45.720 --> 25:51.880]  i i wish he was a good guy i wish this nightmare would end i wish i wasn't so concerned about
[25:51.880 --> 25:59.080]  my financial future and my family and this country in the world i mean i know these are crooks i know
[25:59.080 --> 26:04.280]  these are ruthless very dangerous people in control the presidents are just their frontmen
[26:05.560 --> 26:09.080]  around the world they're openly setting up world government in front of us
[26:11.000 --> 26:12.680]  and i went off this ride folks
[26:15.560 --> 26:21.880]  you don't think i don't want to be in denial you don't think that i'm not wishing this wasn't happening
[26:21.880 --> 26:31.160]  oh i wish it was not happening but it is and so i can't engage in mental gymnastics and
[26:31.160 --> 26:36.040]  double think and lie to myself and tell me tell me what are we supposed to do just
[26:36.600 --> 26:40.360]  just lie to ourselves and then just let this continue on down the road
[26:40.360 --> 26:53.480]  just let them do whatever they want well the answer is do we let them do what they want
[26:54.040 --> 26:58.200]  they're saying it doesn't matter they say we control the executive we control the legislative
[26:58.200 --> 27:04.600]  we control the judicial we control the states we control and created the international bodies
[27:04.600 --> 27:09.320]  that regulate world trade and commerce and finance and we're going to expand our control and have it
[27:09.320 --> 27:14.200]  come out of the shadows into the open right now that's all that's happening they're unveiling it
[27:14.200 --> 27:18.600]  but during a crisis they stage the crisis then they unveil their system

[27:26.040 --> 27:30.600]  bill of rights we're going to launch all these wars they stage an economic collapse and then

[33:08.120 --> 33:11.320]  make sure you decide which side you're on
[33:14.920 --> 33:20.600]  all right let me get into that meeting that i was watching today that congressional hearing
[33:20.600 --> 33:25.000]  that Dennis Kucinich was chairing in his oversight subcommittee that he's over none of the major
[33:25.000 --> 33:29.720]  committees would actually ever have any real issues unless Ron Paul who is on the main banking
[33:29.720 --> 33:35.160]  committee and moving up in seniority he's right next to the chairman the democratic chairman now
[33:35.880 --> 33:41.080]  he's the lead republican uh with a lot of power on that committee so you do see you know four or
[33:41.080 --> 33:46.120]  five minute uh injections of reality from him but that's about it but with this committee
[33:46.120 --> 33:53.000]  um again the first three congressmen that spoke it was amazing issa from california
[33:53.560 --> 34:00.760]  of course kucinich and uh comings from maryland all three really brought up key issues
[34:03.720 --> 34:07.240]  and so that's coming up later on the show and paul watson is doing a story on it but the big
[34:07.240 --> 34:14.200]  issues here let me just run through them are a on every news channel they let neil koshkari the
[34:14.200 --> 34:19.480]  little criminal running the five trillion dollar theft so far they let them have a statement and
[34:19.480 --> 34:24.040]  then cut away so you had to go to seaspeak which a lot of cable systems don't even carry now
[34:25.880 --> 34:31.560]  so you had that going on and uh then you had koshkari just arrogantly saying the same thing over
[34:31.560 --> 34:37.960]  and over again well we had to change it to you know prop up the financial system from collapse
[34:37.960 --> 34:42.440]  and they said but wait a minute the banks are bragging themselves they're using this as cash
[34:42.440 --> 34:53.400]  bonuses and to buy other healthy banks and koshkari wouldn't respond and they got madder
[34:53.400 --> 34:59.240]  and more and more angry and more and more frustrated and then kucinich would read to him
[34:59.240 --> 35:03.640]  the subsections that said they had to do this and that and koshkari would say well you know about
[35:03.640 --> 35:08.440]  this subsection though that says that if we want we don't have to so i got to read a whole contract
[35:08.440 --> 35:17.240]  well they couldn't it was a 500 almost 600 page bill and uh we did get to read the earlier versions
[35:17.240 --> 35:21.560]  and sure enough the bad stuff was in the later version that's what they do these committees the
[35:21.560 --> 35:26.680]  committee chairman wrote it in secret with the lobbyist the banking lobbyist with the goldman
[35:26.680 --> 35:33.960]  sax execs conferring literally with koshkari he was the guy on the hill he helped write the thing
[35:33.960 --> 35:38.680]  and he said yeah it says in the subsections we're gonna help the american people but that
[35:38.680 --> 35:47.880]  ain't happening now jack and the reason he's arrogant the reason bush is arrogant the reason
[35:47.880 --> 35:53.240]  barack obama's arrogant is because they know the executive has been told he will be protected by
[35:53.240 --> 36:02.440]  the banks and by the media and so go ahead with the swindle the big boys are stealing five trillion
[36:02.440 --> 36:08.680]  dollars it's hard that much has already been stolen in five weeks and that's numbers almost
[36:08.680 --> 36:12.360]  two weeks old we get them every two weeks we're about to get new numbers next week that's what
[36:12.360 --> 36:18.200]  they're telling us five trillion three weeks in we're now five weeks in but again we have two
[36:18.200 --> 36:29.400]  week old numbers five trillion i mean the government's budget now is three trillion defense
[36:29.400 --> 36:38.680]  budget alone is a trillion the whole gdp of the country isn't much more than that every year
[36:42.440 --> 36:46.680]  you understand what's happening the banks wall street is eating everything they are
[36:46.680 --> 36:53.800]  gobbling everything remember the derivatives black hole the currency uh all of the uh swaps
[36:53.800 --> 37:01.720]  all these little scam instruments when those had value it was always fiat they bought up real assets
[37:02.680 --> 37:08.360]  and then they leveraged those fiat assets and loaned them as triple a rated gold
[37:09.480 --> 37:16.360]  as the best investment in the world and ism who's really sharp i think he's frankly more articulate
[37:16.360 --> 37:21.720]  than with with the minutiae than even ron paul i think ron paul smart and doesn't bring out all
[37:21.720 --> 37:25.240]  the fine minutiae but i've been studying this quite a bit and that is so was like i want to
[37:25.240 --> 37:31.000]  get him on uh just absolutely hammering him about how this was all garbage and how the government was
[37:31.000 --> 37:43.480]  buying triple a rated crud that is just made up garbage and cost garbage say no it's triple a
[37:43.480 --> 37:49.240]  rated it's gold and and and literally just just had an arrogant laughing at the congress because
[37:49.240 --> 37:55.240]  he knows they're ceremonial ladies and gentlemen he knows that three army brigades it isn't one
[37:55.240 --> 38:00.120]  it isn't two it's three main brigades and a whole bunch of other units
[38:03.080 --> 38:07.000]  you read the original army times report it said a new brigade it was all about that new brigade
[38:07.000 --> 38:16.360]  coming for homeland the third infantry brigade the big mighty three supposedly the army's best
[38:16.360 --> 38:22.200]  killer unit for us that's right for congress that's the praetorian telling congress
[38:24.440 --> 38:28.360]  in rome that sees her saying you do what i say i'm looting at all
[38:33.640 --> 38:38.360]  and then they announced the air force last week two more brigades
[38:40.440 --> 38:44.520]  and the air force was just reporting on support units from the air force
[38:44.520 --> 38:51.160]  bringing in army brigades and then they listed a bunch of other units i mean they are they are
[38:51.160 --> 38:55.720]  bringing the troops some ladies and gentlemen and they're bringing them home for active duty
[38:55.720 --> 39:02.120]  in the united states and in afghanistan and pakistan most of the um 170 000 or so they've
[39:02.120 --> 39:09.000]  gotten iraq in the 200 000 contractors they're going to pakistan they're going to afghanistan
[39:09.000 --> 39:14.200]  they're going to eastern europe and they're coming home here people keep living in denial
[39:14.200 --> 39:19.640]  saying our troops there won't shoot at us our troop oh yeah if there's total riots in a breakdown
[39:19.640 --> 39:24.040]  orchestrated and then the globalists send out some hit teams to kill some troops and
[39:24.680 --> 39:29.560]  people be caught on surveillance camera the bad guys will escape they'll find one
[39:30.840 --> 39:33.240]  mental patient white supremacist to blame it on later
[39:35.640 --> 39:40.200]  literally he'll be out of state school won't even be the guy uh they'll kill a bunch of troops put
[39:40.200 --> 39:44.840]  it on tv and the troops will go completely crazy and mow the people down in the pleasure i mean how
[39:44.840 --> 39:53.800]  do the cops get the other police to attack american citizens in dallas texas or austin texas
[39:53.800 --> 40:01.560]  or seattle washington or denver colorado or minneapolis st paul minnesota they take an
[40:01.560 --> 40:10.360]  intelligence unit under federal orders and they dress them up like an artist and they have them go
[40:10.360 --> 40:15.240]  out to align the cops or just like the general public dumber than dirt on average i'm not being
[40:15.240 --> 40:20.440]  mean i mean just you know you're dumb i'll tell you why you're dumb here in just a minute
[40:22.200 --> 40:25.560]  and they throw bottles at them and they hit cops in the head and they knocked their teeth out and
[40:25.560 --> 40:32.440]  they bleed it's in my film police state to the takeover you know when that film came out december
[40:32.440 --> 40:38.520]  99 got the cops interviewed the ones that weren't stupid the detectives going and then we found out
[40:38.520 --> 40:44.600]  it was our own cops and they ordered them to stand down while they're being hit with bottles and
[40:44.600 --> 40:51.400]  attacked and then every time the cops try to rush and stop them the commanders jump in front and say
[40:51.400 --> 40:55.400]  no no no they're in on it see the whole thing about being a commander and the police is about
[40:55.400 --> 41:01.880]  lying to your force dumbing them down leading them manipulating them i'll never forget i'll tell
[41:01.880 --> 41:13.080]  a story in a minute the point is they then attack the police the police do and then the news cameras
[41:13.080 --> 41:22.120]  shoot that for a few hours put it out on national news and then the police are told okay guys you
[41:22.120 --> 41:26.120]  want to get them get them and the cops run up and rubber bullet families and pepper straight
[41:26.920 --> 41:34.280]  baby carriages it's all on video portland organ google it and break women's collar bones with
[41:34.280 --> 41:38.120]  the clubs and stomp on women on the ground it's all on all in my police state films
[41:42.120 --> 41:48.200]  i mean that's pretty mindless i mean do you like being like a bull and the uh your commanders put
[41:48.200 --> 41:52.360]  a red flag out in front of your red cape and you you run through it right into the sword
[41:54.120 --> 41:57.800]  but instead of running into a sword there's the american people behind the red cape
[41:57.800 --> 42:01.800]  they just hang a red cape out and then you go running after it and then they pull the cape
[42:01.800 --> 42:06.520]  up and you run right over a bunch of innocent americans trying to save the country i mean you're
[42:06.520 --> 42:15.080]  stupid you're dumb i mean i hope you're just dumb i hope you don't all know and you think it's fun
[42:15.080 --> 42:21.960]  to violate the first amendment and to go out and set up families protesting the war the police state
[42:21.960 --> 42:28.760]  the open borders all the stuff you do i mean i've got police in in game blueprint for global
[42:28.760 --> 42:34.120]  enslavement in the mini film the 16 minute film the extra called battle for the republic
[42:37.240 --> 42:43.480]  where if you protest illegal aliens in seattle or in other cities the cops walk up
[42:43.480 --> 42:49.000]  up and say you're not allowed to protest well 50 000 illegal aliens take over the city
[42:49.000 --> 42:54.520]  yeah i mean if you per protested anyway they walk over and the police take your head and they slam
[42:54.520 --> 42:57.640]  it in the ground and they knock your teeth out and the bloodscore it's all over the place
[42:58.440 --> 43:03.720]  they bust your lips open and then they laugh and let the illegal aliens come over and celebrate
[43:03.720 --> 43:09.880]  and then they give high fives and claps with the illegal aliens black cops white cops spanish cops
[43:09.880 --> 43:16.120]  you see they know the job is kill america kill free speech attack it hardcore get it i mean
[43:16.120 --> 43:21.080]  who are you i'm supposed to go along and say you're the good guys whenever i go this is what i
[43:21.080 --> 43:27.160]  catch you doing shame on you but you know what you're gonna pay your bosses are gonna steal your
[43:27.160 --> 43:31.160]  whole future and your children's future so go ahead and think you're on top of the world go
[43:31.160 --> 43:35.800]  ahead and think you're kicking the american people's butt for our own good you're gonna find out this
[43:35.800 --> 43:45.240]  isn't a joke i was gonna tell a story and then i wanted to finish that one so i didn't get to the
[43:45.240 --> 43:56.920]  other one no it doesn't even matter over and over and over again and now it comes out in denver
[43:56.920 --> 44:02.280]  this is just the time they were caught because people videotaped it brought it to the department
[44:02.280 --> 44:06.840]  internal police will be fired or killed or set up now said yeah it's true
[44:09.320 --> 44:13.400]  they had cops denver posted this is the police department admits this don't you try saying
[44:13.400 --> 44:21.160]  it didn't true denver post they had cops attack cops and then pull back and the cops attacked
[44:21.160 --> 44:31.240]  the crowd and arrested over 150 people and that happened while i was at a rent a car place is all
[44:31.240 --> 44:34.440]  we have is an rv we're gonna rent a car to run around town but i talked to the eyewitnesses the
[44:34.440 --> 44:39.800]  911 truthers they videotaped a lot of it then i saw similar things happen but you're in a crowd
[44:39.800 --> 44:43.480]  the cops hold you back it looks like they're cops but you can't prove it so i said well
[44:44.200 --> 44:48.600]  maybe denver cops did an okay job because at least they didn't come up to any crowd with a sign
[44:48.600 --> 44:53.240]  and so you've got to be in a free speech zone at least the general cops on the surface didn't
[44:53.240 --> 44:56.760]  violate the first amendment so i came on air and said denver cops for the first time ever
[44:56.760 --> 45:01.880]  that i can prove didn't provocateur we have eyewitnesses that say they saw marine corps vans
[45:01.880 --> 45:09.560]  pull up the the the marines openly put black uniforms on over uh their shorts and shirts
[45:10.280 --> 45:14.280]  and then later it comes out that it that indeed did happen and then they went and we heard there
[45:14.280 --> 45:17.880]  was a riot and we you know you're this is cat and mouse and we got there right after it happened
[45:17.880 --> 45:22.280]  and cops ran up and said turn your cameras off the one time they were out of line and said don't
[45:22.280 --> 45:28.200]  be videotaping here now we know why they had just staged an event so i tried to give you the benefit
[45:28.200 --> 45:33.560]  of the doubt but of course i just i've never seen a force of a large city that doesn't hire
[45:33.560 --> 45:39.560]  provocateurs and i don't mean provocateurs to mix in and then you know see what's going on i mean
[45:39.560 --> 45:50.040]  they go out and they will take take many ampels st paul on video you see guys in black uniforms
[45:50.040 --> 45:57.080]  who have the build of cops the body language they're not drug addict uh anarchist okay they're not
[45:57.080 --> 46:04.760]  five foot six uh you know 125 pounds big cops i mean so ridiculous these big cops dressed up
[46:04.760 --> 46:09.160]  like anarchists run through the line and dump some stuff over and break it and then the cops beat
[46:09.160 --> 46:12.920]  the hell out of all the innocent people and rubber bullet them and take them to jail and go crazy on
[46:12.920 --> 46:19.880]  the news i mean these big gorilla cops you know on average about six foot four 240 pounds
[46:19.880 --> 46:23.960]  muscle-bound come bashing through the cop line and then run back into the cop line
[46:25.720 --> 46:33.000]  it's cops a five-year-old would know that just like in austin when they had the fortune 599
[46:37.720 --> 46:42.280]  and i know i keep talking about this because it just goes to the fundamental basics of everything
[46:43.640 --> 46:47.480]  and there's about 400 of us out there peacefully protesting the fortune 500
[46:47.480 --> 46:51.480]  that was meeting at the four seasons in austin and we were going to march from the capital
[46:51.480 --> 46:56.920]  even got the stinking permit by doing that then they get to have the riot police on that like
[46:56.920 --> 47:01.240]  your criminals because they just stays the feds just stayed seattle a few months before
[47:04.600 --> 47:08.680]  and so we're out there and i had the anarchist walk over and say we're going to kill you
[47:09.240 --> 47:13.080]  not all the anarchists the fed group and i said you work for the feds he said yeah i do
[47:13.080 --> 47:17.400]  see those guys in those buildings we're taking this country over when we do we're going to kill
[47:17.400 --> 47:22.280]  you i mean they know you know this was the older guy with the foundation handlers of the young
[47:22.280 --> 47:28.440]  people i went whoa and i know and i saw these big guys i mean one guy was like six foot six
[47:28.440 --> 47:36.280]  probably 280 pounds nfl type in a black mask with a bandana shoving people going let's do
[47:36.280 --> 47:41.560]  something let's break something and the other one was about six feet tall probably 240 giant cops
[47:41.560 --> 47:46.920]  and i go come on cops i said we got cops over here get out of here and all of a sudden the
[47:46.920 --> 47:49.960]  anarchists were tugging them on one leave them alone jones leave them alone jones and like
[47:49.960 --> 47:54.760]  poking me with two fingers hard in the back elbow on me come on jones working with them
[47:57.320 --> 48:02.360]  and i was just like no do not start trouble and the news ran over and all of a sudden
[48:02.360 --> 48:07.240]  50 something cops or more from across prego knock it off jones they had commanders out there
[48:07.240 --> 48:13.160]  and they come running across knock it off jones uh huh and they pull those two out and five minutes
[48:13.160 --> 48:20.840]  later put two more and it was so ridiculous two giant meatheads because you know they're scared
[48:20.840 --> 48:25.720]  of the crowds so they only put in the toughest volunteers to be with the hardened foundation
[48:25.720 --> 48:32.680]  criminals the little intelligence operatives who are all marxist linonist but their their cover
[48:32.680 --> 48:39.800]  is that they're a anarchist and they always are shipped in this is in my film it's admitted
[48:39.800 --> 48:46.600]  they have these forward foundation funds flying these squads around of anarchists to then start
[48:46.600 --> 48:52.760]  fights but but if they don't do it they should have the cops do it and the cops always stand
[48:52.760 --> 48:56.920]  down let the anarchists carry off and they'll be housed in a government building and police cars
[48:56.920 --> 49:03.400]  protect them it's all on video that's your government ladies and gentlemen because it's
[49:03.400 --> 49:08.680]  not your government it's a criminal group there to violate the first amendment and suppress and

[54:47.000 --> 54:57.480]  morning on cnn we pull up the exact thing mentally it was a global banking governance what was the
[54:57.480 --> 55:03.480]  term they called it a banking world governance that was it banking world governance and governance
[55:03.480 --> 55:07.960]  is government i mean they're just openly saying world government by the banks

[55:16.680 --> 55:20.600]  just want to bring ted up briefly for this segment the next but uh ladies and gentlemen
[55:21.560 --> 55:27.240]  regardless uh you know gold's back up right now but and it may go down again before it goes back
[55:27.240 --> 55:34.280]  up but this is the time to be buying gold and silver before it races back up they're talking
[55:34.280 --> 55:40.920]  about global currency devaluations the minute that happens unified currency devaluation
[55:40.920 --> 55:47.320]  that translates to unified world inflation where the bankers manage everything and design
[55:47.320 --> 55:53.080]  everything to implode economies the bankers want to implode your economies they kept begging cash
[55:53.080 --> 55:55.960]  carry the committee chairman others don't you want to help the people we're going to have
[55:55.960 --> 56:01.160]  socialism shouldn't it go to the people not to foreign banks the bankers want historically
[56:01.160 --> 56:06.520]  to set you up to blow you out that's where they get real assets all right i can talk forever i want
[56:06.520 --> 56:13.640]  to bring ted up uh ted you've got gold from the price it was what three days ago uh when it was
[56:13.640 --> 56:20.120]  what 25 30 less than it is now so you pass on that savings gold is being sold at a premium
[56:20.120 --> 56:25.640]  everywhere because they're manipulating the market down trying to hold it down but then physical
[56:25.640 --> 56:32.840]  supplies are most brokers are sold out you can pull it up yourself ted has it with no premium in
[56:32.840 --> 56:38.120]  fact he has it at lower than the price it's currently selling at ted give us the offer
[56:38.120 --> 56:43.880]  yeah i can tell you right now right now at this particular time i've got british sovereign coins
[56:43.880 --> 56:49.560]  and i did i picked these up when gold was at between trading between 710 and 720 and right now
[56:49.560 --> 56:56.200]  gold is at 751 so give me an idea where this is at oh i'm sorry yeah since i hit refresh it's going
[56:56.200 --> 57:01.640]  up i'm sorry yeah so here we are looking at gold right now the british sovereigns are 228 last time
[57:01.640 --> 57:08.280]  i made an offer on those british sovereigns are at 241 so they're down by almost 20 bucks the
[57:08.280 --> 57:15.480]  frank coin right now i picked those up at 187 187 as a comparison to the price of 198 so you're
[57:15.480 --> 57:20.600]  saving 11 bucks a coin on those multiply that by five that's how much there is an you know price
[57:20.600 --> 57:27.720]  browns so uh we also have uh we also have the uh the ten dollar liberties and ten dollar indians
[57:27.720 --> 57:32.760]  like we talked about both at really really low prices and comparatively in the marketplace you
[57:32.760 --> 57:39.320]  can't find them anywhere else 1-800-686-2237 gold is scarce silver is scarce it's selling for

[59:45.240 --> 59:50.840]  alex jones there's a lot of denial about this on this very network i heard a host yesterday
[59:51.400 --> 59:57.400]  tell a caller that there's no truth to a million man spy army and youth brigades when it was on
[59:57.400 --> 1:00:02.680]  brock obama's own website they took it down that made mainstream news when his chief of staff wrote
[1:00:02.680 --> 1:00:07.880]  a book about it we played audio clips of him saying mandatory domestic force doesn't matter

[1:00:28.680 --> 1:00:30.840]  uh... but it usually takes longer
[1:00:30.840 --> 1:00:31.880]  um...
[1:00:31.880 --> 1:00:34.040]  for people that don't understand economics this is just
[1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:35.640]  this is
[1:00:35.640 --> 1:00:38.120]  this is the end my friend my only friend
[1:00:38.760 --> 1:00:40.920]  beautiful friend i mean i don't know what to say here
[1:00:41.560 --> 1:00:43.160]  um...
[1:00:43.160 --> 1:00:47.720]  the end of an order on the end of a system but again the globalists are doing this by design
[1:00:47.720 --> 1:00:50.520]  they say it in their own documents that we've published posted
[1:00:51.800 --> 1:00:53.480]  that they are killing the dollar
[1:00:54.040 --> 1:00:55.000]  that is reducing it
[1:00:55.560 --> 1:01:00.600]  brings into a basket of currencies to prepare us for a world monetary unification
[1:01:00.600 --> 1:01:03.240]  where you still have your currencies but they're standardized
[1:01:04.040 --> 1:01:05.000]  and operate
[1:01:05.000 --> 1:01:05.400]  how many
[1:01:06.280 --> 1:01:07.720]  for over a decade i've told you that
[1:01:09.240 --> 1:01:12.520]  that that you will have a world currency that people will still hold their money and go but it's a
[1:01:12.520 --> 1:01:13.240]  dollar
[1:01:13.240 --> 1:01:15.880]  but it's a euro but it's a pound but it's a yen
[1:01:15.880 --> 1:01:17.080]  it's a yawn
[1:01:17.080 --> 1:01:18.280]  but it's a shekel
[1:01:18.280 --> 1:01:18.920]  it's a dinar
[1:01:20.040 --> 1:01:21.960]  but it will be globally set
[1:01:22.920 --> 1:01:27.160]  through the three major regions in the seven subregions it's all stated
[1:01:27.160 --> 1:01:28.920]  and exactly what we said is now happening
[1:01:28.920 --> 1:01:31.240]  that enters has got a great golden silver offer for you
[1:01:32.200 --> 1:01:36.520]  you're going to see hyperinflation they're trying to suppress it right now so they can buy up assets
[1:01:37.080 --> 1:01:40.360]  uh... it's like a pogo stick it's going to go back up and sky high
[1:01:40.360 --> 1:01:41.960]  gold is raced up
[1:01:43.160 --> 1:01:44.360]  close to thirty bucks
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:48.760]  i guess more than thirty bucks went from seven ten to seven forty five
[1:01:49.640 --> 1:01:51.720]  that's thirty five dollars in the last three days
[1:01:52.280 --> 1:01:56.440]  ted has it when he bought it three days ago so he's passing that savings on to you ted tell him the
[1:01:56.440 --> 1:02:01.960]  coins again the numbers eight hundred six eight six two two three seven eight hundred six eight six
[1:02:01.960 --> 1:02:07.640]  two two three seven give him the number again ted yeah one eight hundred six eight six two two three seven
[1:02:07.640 --> 1:02:12.280]  uh... the thing about it is alex have always suggested that people get into small gold and
[1:02:12.280 --> 1:02:16.440]  have it physically in their possession i mean a lot of people are thinking that they can buy this
[1:02:16.440 --> 1:02:20.280]  stuff and have certificates and store it and you know you don't want that you want to get it in
[1:02:20.280 --> 1:02:25.560]  your hands and that's why i've been recommending the frank coin the coin is trading at one eighty
[1:02:25.560 --> 1:02:30.440]  seven it's a fifth of an ounce of gold the british sovereign right now two twenty eight
[1:02:30.440 --> 1:02:35.720]  that coin is a quarter of an ounce of gold get it in your hands have it for one that one that
[1:02:35.720 --> 1:02:40.280]  one one times of trouble coming we're already seeing that walking liberty haves have been able
[1:02:40.280 --> 1:02:45.480]  to get those again that they've they've been gone they haven't been on just i i couldn't get anything
[1:02:45.480 --> 1:02:50.280]  in that particular arena and right now i've got the few bags of them at eight eight dollars and
[1:02:50.280 --> 1:02:56.360]  forty cents a piece or at sixteen hundred eighty dollars per roll of twenty that is a great buy
[1:02:56.360 --> 1:03:02.040]  at this time uh... you write about that the reid martin wise right now look at bloomberg look at
[1:03:02.040 --> 1:03:08.520]  any of these big stock firm very big bloomberg is sounding like the alex jones show i'm not
[1:03:08.520 --> 1:03:14.040]  kidding you alex the the the mainstream the people out in uh... in wall street right now
[1:03:14.040 --> 1:03:20.040]  are thinking that you should buy gold and silver martin wise has always been a uh... a stock guy
[1:03:20.040 --> 1:03:24.920]  and he's saying that you should have twenty five percent of your assets in physical gold that you're
[1:03:24.920 --> 1:03:29.960]  actually holding on to and then after that you want to speculate in the mining stock area or you
[1:03:29.960 --> 1:03:35.000]  want to put yourself into some sort of a share builders account i'll say right now medical because
[1:03:35.000 --> 1:03:39.000]  the there's a few things that will always be there uh... ted you know we got philberg coming up i'm
[1:03:39.000 --> 1:03:42.840]  gonna come back and finish up with what mr wise is talking about and bring up the big issue people
[1:03:42.840 --> 1:03:47.640]  get freaked out when you tell them that uh... you know six months ago a year ago that uh... in
[1:03:47.640 --> 1:03:52.680]  annuities aren't guaranteed well now mainstream media is in that as announcing that annuities may
[1:03:52.680 --> 1:04:00.200]  default uh... no folks they're not fdic uh... protected uh... and and now they're talking about looting
[1:04:00.200 --> 1:04:07.400]  pension funds private 401k's mainstream news folks need to physically hold it right back
[1:04:07.400 --> 1:04:11.320]  hello friends this is alex jones i've told you for a long time it's important to be
[1:04:11.320 --> 1:04:15.560]  self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever we need to be independent and food
[1:04:15.560 --> 1:04:20.040]  and water is the key you'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread you'll
[1:04:20.040 --> 1:04:24.840]  never have to go to the super dough and beg for female to take care of your family in any emergency
[1:04:24.840 --> 1:04:29.720]  if you simply prepare our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for special interest
[1:04:29.720 --> 1:04:34.120]  so they ignored your screams not to do it they turned off the telephones and email they voted
[1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:38.840]  to print eight hundred and fifty billion dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the
[1:04:38.840 --> 1:04:44.200]  america and european banks the exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings
[1:04:44.200 --> 1:04:49.560]  to nothing and blast the cost of necessities particularly food beyond many americans reach
[1:04:49.560 --> 1:04:54.680]  in pre-nazi germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it
[1:04:54.680 --> 1:04:59.800]  reached over four billion marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there
[1:04:59.800 --> 1:05:04.760]  may be no end in sight the private banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery
[1:05:04.760 --> 1:05:09.320]  stores enough money to restock their shelves the stores have less food but jack of prices to stay
[1:05:09.320 --> 1:05:14.440]  in business whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing
[1:05:14.440 --> 1:05:19.240]  it on food one third of americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities
[1:05:19.240 --> 1:05:24.360]  my friends whatever it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there
[1:05:24.360 --> 1:05:28.200]  listening it's very important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food the
[1:05:28.200 --> 1:05:32.840]  government the new old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a mindset a mindset of
[1:05:32.840 --> 1:05:37.400]  self-sufficiency and preparedness no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation

[1:07:14.920 --> 1:07:19.320]  papers wall street journal that the bankers are just keeping the money i mean why would
[1:07:20.200 --> 1:07:24.440]  two weeks ago why would the head of goldman sacks in a conference call with the new york
[1:07:24.440 --> 1:07:28.520]  times and other papers laugh and say we're fine we're just keeping the money for bonuses and
[1:07:28.520 --> 1:07:35.160]  buying good banks i mean it is just such arrogance because they know they have the executive they
[1:07:35.160 --> 1:07:39.800]  have the military they have the intelligence operations they can just do it out in the open
[1:07:39.800 --> 1:07:47.800]  i mean ted i'm even flabbergasted and and and and and dumbstruck thunderbolted uh dizzyed dazed i
[1:07:47.800 --> 1:07:54.120]  marvel uh you know like they say uh john on the olive patmos marveled at the beast i just marvel
[1:07:54.120 --> 1:07:59.720]  i mean it's like a trick they play the way kashkari sits there real smart ass with a little smiley
[1:07:59.720 --> 1:08:05.320]  face on and i'm sorry for that term folks but the only way to describe it before congress going
[1:08:05.320 --> 1:08:08.280]  look i know we said we were going to do this but we're not we're keeping the money and there's
[1:08:08.280 --> 1:08:13.160]  nothing you can do about it ted anderson that's what they're doing right now they're they're
[1:08:13.160 --> 1:08:17.480]  using the money to pay out bonuses they're using the money to buy up the fledgling companies that
[1:08:17.480 --> 1:08:23.000]  are struggling right now they're building bigger organizations and showing up uh bigger monopolies
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:27.320]  in the marketplace and that's that's what they're doing with our tax dollars that's what our 700
[1:08:27.320 --> 1:08:31.800]  billion dollars is buying and and and lacing their own pockets while they're doing this
[1:08:31.800 --> 1:08:37.240]  and then using the same thing as a tool to gain even further control of the world and that's
[1:08:37.240 --> 1:08:43.160]  you know this this this g20 thing that we have going on you you may think that it's our politicians
[1:08:43.160 --> 1:08:47.720]  that are going over there that are trying to steer our economy but wake up and this is
[1:08:47.720 --> 1:08:53.720]  the this is the uh the corporate uh institutions that control our politicians this is the real
[1:08:53.720 --> 1:08:58.120]  government yeah it's the government behind the government and now they're just coming right
[1:08:58.120 --> 1:09:02.200]  out and saying it look the banks are going to run the world and but you know at least they're
[1:09:02.200 --> 1:09:07.640]  admitting to it now this is what's been going on here in the united states for you know how long
[1:09:07.640 --> 1:09:11.480]  since the federal reserve system has been brought about that's right they're just bringing out in
[1:09:11.480 --> 1:09:18.200]  the open what they've always said and i want to explain to people again everything globalism did
[1:09:18.200 --> 1:09:24.920]  was to make every country uh to where it was no longer independent where you didn't have family
[1:09:24.920 --> 1:09:30.680]  farms and ranches where the average person had greater debt than they had savings or negative
[1:09:30.680 --> 1:09:39.000]  savings and as soon as the us became a negative uh debtor and had zero savings on average the
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:44.360]  country has the lowest savings rate it had uh in its history greater than the great depression
[1:09:44.360 --> 1:09:51.800]  so we have a minus savings on average we are overall public private government in debt as
[1:09:51.800 --> 1:09:58.360]  soon as we cross that in in 2007 they announced we're popping the bubble this is this is what
[1:09:58.360 --> 1:10:05.720]  they meant to do this was designed to operate this way they stated it they brag about it people
[1:10:05.720 --> 1:10:12.120]  keep begging please kashkari please pulse and please help us why don't you we're going bankrupt
[1:10:12.120 --> 1:10:17.880]  we're losing everything the economy's imploding and they go absolutely dumbass excuse me again
[1:10:17.880 --> 1:10:22.920]  that's what they're saying to us that's the whole point and then now they're going to implode everything
[1:10:22.920 --> 1:10:28.200]  have youth brigades tattletale squads you'll have to have government jobs total control
[1:10:28.200 --> 1:10:33.160]  they don't want you being able to stand upon your own two feet they want to bankrupt you economically
[1:10:33.160 --> 1:10:41.080]  so they can totally take over this is by design stated by them and that's why they hopefully revolt
[1:10:41.080 --> 1:10:45.720]  and go out and shoot cops in military they hope there's a civil war that'll just drive the economy
[1:10:45.720 --> 1:10:52.920]  down more they call it the imf riot in the not declassified the the stolen documents that were
[1:10:52.920 --> 1:10:57.800]  released right after sticklets left wink wink who released them and then the world bank admitted
[1:10:57.800 --> 1:11:03.560]  those are our documents bbc reported and they said after we cut off liquidity an economy implodes
[1:11:03.560 --> 1:11:10.440]  over the six months to a year then we cut off the water the food we kick people out of their houses
[1:11:10.440 --> 1:11:17.320]  then they riot then the stocks go down to zero then we buy it all up you see folks we're just
[1:11:17.320 --> 1:11:21.960]  getting started in the pain we've got to go through ted anderson well yeah that's what's
[1:11:21.960 --> 1:11:28.840]  going on i mean we fought a revolution in 1776 we won king george and uh and and uh the king
[1:11:28.840 --> 1:11:34.120]  roth child i should say back then uh we need to get away from this banking and now we're being
[1:11:34.120 --> 1:11:39.640]  bankrupted we're being economically attacked by the exact same bunch literally they're great great
[1:11:39.640 --> 1:11:44.280]  great great great grandsons they're the ones that are going in there and they're messing with our
[1:11:44.280 --> 1:11:50.280]  economies and we should have another revolution hopefully a peaceful one we need to get back
[1:11:50.280 --> 1:11:58.360]  to constitutional money it is the only only and i say the only solution to end new world order the
[1:11:58.360 --> 1:12:04.760]  united states of america cannot turn over its purse purse strings to a central banking system
[1:12:04.760 --> 1:12:08.280]  i mean right now i mean if you think about it alex you know it really makes me just
[1:12:08.280 --> 1:12:14.680]  just lividly mad about is the fact that you can go down to washington dc right now and we're we the
[1:12:14.680 --> 1:12:19.000]  people are printing the currency but we don't even get to use it we have to turn it over the
[1:12:19.000 --> 1:12:24.440]  federal reserve bank they put a stamp on it and then they lend it back to us and charge us interest
[1:12:24.440 --> 1:12:29.320]  on that loan and to throw insult the injury in there it's made out of a cotton that our farmers
[1:12:29.320 --> 1:12:34.200]  grew that we turned it into the put it over to the textile plants turned it into the fabric for
[1:12:34.200 --> 1:12:40.520]  which is printed on the whole thing is done by our labor yet we take this currency as a loan and
[1:12:40.520 --> 1:12:45.960]  now we are on the hook to pay them not only the principal back but also the interest no darn wonder
[1:12:45.960 --> 1:12:52.680]  why we have to turn over over half of our labor just to service the taxes so the so the us treasury
[1:12:52.680 --> 1:12:58.520]  can service the interest on the debt the biggest the most largest portion of the united states budget
[1:12:58.520 --> 1:13:05.240]  goes to debt ted five trillion in three weeks now again this has been going on for almost six but
[1:13:05.240 --> 1:13:09.320]  we have numbers from two weeks ago now that's the latest numbers they come out every few weeks
[1:13:09.320 --> 1:13:15.560]  we haven't gotten the new ones so it's even more five trillion and two plus trillion the
[1:13:15.560 --> 1:13:21.000]  federal reserve and the treasury say we will not tell you they tell congress we're not going to tell
[1:13:21.000 --> 1:13:28.840]  you where your money went and then they are just setting the precedent to do whatever they want
[1:13:28.840 --> 1:13:32.920]  ted here's the deal what do you think the next thing will be they're openly setting up world
[1:13:32.920 --> 1:13:37.480]  government they're openly announcing new world order folks google new world order and click google
[1:13:37.480 --> 1:13:45.800]  news hundreds of hits hundreds of newspapers are telling you it's a new world order they love it ted
[1:13:45.800 --> 1:13:51.000]  go ahead well that's the thing i mean right now we what we're doing is we're turning over our power
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:55.400]  i mean we have elections here in the united states but it doesn't matter who we put in office
[1:13:55.400 --> 1:14:00.280]  because if they can't make a budget if the economy is imploding if they're having trouble
[1:14:00.280 --> 1:14:06.120]  they're going to answer to these people they want to have lower interest rates and a going economy
[1:14:06.120 --> 1:14:12.440]  so we can afford to eat feed each other uh you know have a system that works ted on google i just
[1:14:12.440 --> 1:14:18.440]  typed new world order you know typed out the full word the full set of three words a new world order
[1:14:19.560 --> 1:14:29.720]  59713 and g20 shaping a new world order mapping out a new world order obama world crisis in the
[1:14:29.720 --> 1:14:36.280]  new world order i mean this is thousands of newspapers saying it's a new world order now
[1:14:36.280 --> 1:14:42.040]  if i back up and click on new world order and click web the top link is the cia run
[1:14:42.040 --> 1:14:47.160]  wikipedia saying it's a headline new world order conspiracy theory and they go on to
[1:14:47.160 --> 1:14:53.720]  say it doesn't exist in the encyclopedia so i can click on news and there's 59 000 news articles
[1:14:53.720 --> 1:14:58.040]  saying we're in the new world order global banks running everything exactly what we always said
[1:14:58.040 --> 1:15:02.680]  because we have their own documents but then you click on the web and it doesn't exist ted
[1:15:02.680 --> 1:15:08.360]  well that's right and and and the thing about it is is our forefathers set down a constitution
[1:15:08.360 --> 1:15:14.840]  so this exact thing would not happen you can go and take a look at the diaries of thomas jefferson
[1:15:14.840 --> 1:15:20.360]  and some of the other you know people that form the united states constitution and you can see
[1:15:20.360 --> 1:15:25.240]  exactly why they didn't want to do this they didn't want to turn the power over to a financial
[1:15:25.240 --> 1:15:31.240]  institution the united states should be governed by the people for the people not by some foreign
[1:15:31.240 --> 1:15:36.360]  bank my gosh we can't even have a president and by the way again these are totally ruthless people
[1:15:36.360 --> 1:15:40.360]  the time we've got left here ted i'm sorry to interrupt you it's just so much is happening
[1:15:40.360 --> 1:15:44.120]  in my mind right now i know your mind is racing i interrupted and forget what i was going to say
[1:15:44.120 --> 1:15:50.280]  the point is uh... i mean this is really happening these are really ruthless people
[1:15:50.280 --> 1:15:54.760]  they don't want you to live a good life well alex you're about to cover a subject to say hey is
[1:15:54.760 --> 1:15:59.880]  barack obama eligible to be the president of the united states well that is all about whether or
[1:15:59.880 --> 1:16:05.960]  not he's a naturally born citizen or not and why do you think we have a rule that says a
[1:16:05.960 --> 1:16:09.880]  foreigner cannot be the president of the united states and that is because
[1:16:09.880 --> 1:16:16.440]  the interest of the president should be to protect and to and to represent the people
[1:16:16.440 --> 1:16:23.080]  of the united states not some foreign nation and this is a foreign nation that has taken control
[1:16:23.080 --> 1:16:27.640]  of the united states of america and what do you think they want us to do you know that's it
[1:16:27.640 --> 1:16:34.680]  that's what globalism is is is is this multinational corporate crime syndicate that sits above nations
[1:16:34.680 --> 1:16:40.200]  that destroys nations destroys middle classes place countries off against themselves so there's
[1:16:40.200 --> 1:16:45.240]  no one can resist them this is the tyranny open we told you world government run by the banks
[1:16:45.240 --> 1:16:50.600]  here it is they orchestrated it just like we told you and here's what's scary we're only reading you
[1:16:50.600 --> 1:16:55.160]  what they said they would do we knew all this because we were reading their own documents next
[1:16:55.160 --> 1:17:00.920]  they say they're gonna have one child policies and inject us with cancer viruses look i know that

[1:22:36.200 --> 1:22:45.720]  apparatus and they have trained them to follow orders and do whatever they're told and congress
[1:22:45.720 --> 1:22:52.280]  has been cowed they use a backfire in the in the capital parking lot to send in paramilitary

[1:23:07.640 --> 1:23:15.480]  executive see that's a martial law meanwhile it was the executive mail the anthrax to the
[1:23:15.480 --> 1:23:20.840]  capital we know that and they were on separate to fight it the white house but that's a whole
[1:23:20.840 --> 1:23:25.720]  other story to cover and failed enemies ted and closing uh this issue of them just claiming
[1:23:25.720 --> 1:23:30.680]  oh there's no oversight we have the right of kings and then kashkari just sits there and
[1:23:31.240 --> 1:23:35.960]  gives them a smart mouth you know a little smiley face look uh as congress says they're
[1:23:35.960 --> 1:23:40.120]  saying but everybody's going bankrupt everything's falling apart you know you said the bailout was
[1:23:40.120 --> 1:23:48.760]  for them and kashkari says i'm sorry but it's not now i'm sorry ted anderson yeah yeah i'm
[1:23:48.760 --> 1:23:53.400]  just i'm just thinking about this whole thing alex i mean it's really there you what we're
[1:23:53.400 --> 1:23:58.840]  going to get what we deserve because if we don't stand up and fight this thing they're they're
[1:23:58.840 --> 1:24:03.800]  going to get away with you know they'll do whatever they they want to we the people it's us we're the
[1:24:03.800 --> 1:24:08.760]  ones that have to get up and we have to do something about this it's not going to be congress
[1:24:08.760 --> 1:24:14.200]  and it's certainly not going to be the executive branch we us we're the ones that have to actually
[1:24:14.200 --> 1:24:19.720]  take some action and you know stage protests do you know whatever it's going to take but those
[1:24:19.720 --> 1:24:24.200]  aren't allowed those are unamerican that's not allowed in the bill of rights the founding fathers
[1:24:24.200 --> 1:24:28.760]  fought so cops and blacks mask and tell you you couldn't protest now now now tim we're almost
[1:24:28.760 --> 1:24:32.600]  out of time here and i you know had you want to talk about golden silver and we've gone off into
[1:24:32.600 --> 1:24:36.840]  all the things that are happening uh and when we come back i want to briefly give the audience
[1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:41.160]  an overall view of the exact structure of world government that they've already set up that they're
[1:24:41.160 --> 1:24:47.320]  now unveiling to us the slaves and preparing to enforce carbon taxes and youth brigades and
[1:24:47.320 --> 1:24:52.440]  tattletale squads and environmental inspectors in your home go ahead and laugh you're it's gonna
[1:24:52.440 --> 1:24:58.120]  it's already happening um but but give people that golden silver offer again because those are
[1:24:58.120 --> 1:25:03.320]  some great deals well okay you've been you've been touching me where my heart is so i'll get back to
[1:25:03.320 --> 1:25:07.560]  that right now i have british sovereigns are at two hundred and twenty eight dollars that's a quarter
[1:25:07.560 --> 1:25:13.560]  of an ounce gold piece get them in your hands and own them uh franks are at 187 right now they're
[1:25:13.560 --> 1:25:18.840]  eleven dollars cheaper than they were only just a few days ago i picked them up when gold was real
[1:25:18.840 --> 1:25:24.040]  cheap when gold went down and now i have them at a better price for you buy them uh the other thing
[1:25:24.040 --> 1:25:29.240]  is the walking liberty half it's a silver coin they're at eight dollars and forty cents silver
[1:25:29.240 --> 1:25:34.840]  dollars right now alex are just under 25 bucks a piece you can get into 50 cent pieces right now
[1:25:34.840 --> 1:25:39.800]  at eight dollars and 40 cents obviously that's the place to go get the point is there's a huge
[1:25:39.800 --> 1:25:44.840]  premium on silver dollars because they're so hard to get but these gorgeous half dollars and by the
[1:25:44.840 --> 1:25:52.280]  way i've got a bag of them uh are from what 43 44 45 just gorgeous little coins and you get them a
[1:25:52.280 --> 1:25:56.920]  lot closer to melt you sure do you get a lot closer to melt in addition to this you have
[1:25:56.920 --> 1:26:02.280]  something that's recognizable that you can use as money because when it comes time to buying gas
[1:26:02.280 --> 1:26:07.400]  and food when the the dollar is completely collapsed and you know and you have something
[1:26:07.400 --> 1:26:11.880]  that's valuable that's going to buy it for you look i got a picture hanging on my wall
[1:26:11.880 --> 1:26:17.080]  of a kid playing on the step and all around him is wymer republic notes and he's playing
[1:26:17.080 --> 1:26:22.040]  with wymer republic notes and the reason why that happened is because the debts of the wymer
[1:26:22.040 --> 1:26:27.640]  republic got to be so excessive that they had to debase the currency down to zero in order just
[1:26:27.640 --> 1:26:31.560]  to service the interest on the debt what do you think is happening here in the united states
[1:26:31.560 --> 1:26:35.960]  what do you think the rest of those banks outside of the united states how much do they
[1:26:35.960 --> 1:26:41.000]  care about the value of these banks are globalists they're not american banks they're raping you
[1:26:41.000 --> 1:26:46.600]  they hate this country this is a military attack they set us up they pay tax incentives to get the
[1:26:46.600 --> 1:26:52.120]  factories overseas now they're going to come in as the country dies and put carbon taxes
[1:26:52.120 --> 1:26:57.960]  on all human activity and quote bankrupt the coal companies folks they're going to rape you and rape
[1:26:57.960 --> 1:27:02.680]  you and rape you and rape you and rape you and rape you and rape you these are the people that
[1:27:02.680 --> 1:27:08.440]  funded the soviets and funded the nazis and funded mal our criminal government put malin hey it's
[1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:14.360]  simple as this alex in 1913 we got the federal reserve system but you couldn't have a central bank
[1:27:14.360 --> 1:27:21.160]  without a federal tax now they want to have a world tax for a world bank and that's exactly
[1:27:21.160 --> 1:27:25.880]  what that carbon tax thing is it'll bang they said it they're saying it you understand this is not
[1:27:25.880 --> 1:27:30.360]  our opinion there's no more time for you to live in denial out there i'm not talking to our main
[1:27:30.360 --> 1:27:34.680]  listeners i mean all the idiots out there that are still in denial to tune in i'm telling you
[1:27:34.680 --> 1:27:39.880]  this isn't a game this isn't a joke these people are very serious the least you can do is protect
[1:27:39.880 --> 1:27:47.480]  yourself 800-686-2237 give them a call they got british sovereigns franks indians they got them all

[1:33:07.880 --> 1:33:12.360]  it's time to choose which side you're on for those who work for the government and power structure
[1:33:12.920 --> 1:33:17.080]  it's time for you to decide whose side you're on but more importantly the yuppies the know-it-alls
[1:33:17.080 --> 1:33:23.480]  the fake liberals the fake conservatives the abominoids the bushites the establishment lackeys
[1:33:23.480 --> 1:33:28.280]  that are tuned into the false left right political system that are fooled by all that it's time to
[1:33:28.280 --> 1:33:38.520]  grow up and to stop being delusional idiots that look there's i can't deal with it you go to wikipedia
[1:33:38.520 --> 1:33:43.400]  you go to the encyclopedia britannica they tell you a new order doesn't exist dangerous racist talk
[1:33:43.400 --> 1:33:51.880]  about it it doesn't exist you know they claim i mean go to the wikipedia site it says oh there
[1:33:51.880 --> 1:33:56.680]  there are people that claim there's a powerful world conspiracy by the banks to take over and
[1:33:56.680 --> 1:34:02.200]  have carbon taxes we're just reading their official statements new world order
[1:34:02.920 --> 1:34:08.280]  refers to a supposed conspiracy in which a powerful and secretive group is plotting
[1:34:08.280 --> 1:34:13.000]  they're powerful they're not secretive i mean it's out in the open it's plotting to eventually
[1:34:13.000 --> 1:34:17.320]  rule the world via a autonomous world government yeah private corporate government which would
[1:34:17.320 --> 1:34:23.320]  replace sovereign states and other checks and balances in world power struggles in this theory
[1:34:23.320 --> 1:34:27.400]  many significant occurrences are said to be caused by a powerful secret group or groups
[1:34:27.960 --> 1:34:32.760]  well yeah you they openly write white paper saying they're doing it historical and current
[1:34:32.760 --> 1:34:39.400]  events are seen as steps oh see as everything we say happens oh we see it we interpret it
[1:34:39.400 --> 1:34:44.680]  no they say they're doing it to us but see they won't let you change this and have actual quotes
[1:34:44.680 --> 1:34:55.080]  in here by by by the world government and suddenly what wikipedia just got edited while i was
[1:34:55.080 --> 1:34:59.720]  watching and it'll be changed in a second it says this is not a conspiracy info awards dot com
[1:34:59.720 --> 1:35:07.720]  history of the term somebody just went into wikipedia and edited it uh right in front of me
[1:35:07.720 --> 1:35:12.040]  and and and and put us in there the modern use of the phrase new world order originated in the
[1:35:12.040 --> 1:35:16.280]  early 20th century by Cecil Rhodes who advocated the british empire the United States of america
[1:35:16.280 --> 1:35:23.480]  should jointly impose a federal world government to bring about lasting world peace a sinister
[1:35:23.480 --> 1:35:27.640]  motive is seen in the fact that Rhodes founded the Rhodes scholarship when it goes on so somebody
[1:35:27.640 --> 1:35:31.480]  went in and just added the part this is not a conspiracy yeah you should add the part
[1:35:31.480 --> 1:35:35.640]  that it's in thousands of news articles a day saying the banks will openly run everything
[1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:41.320]  run world commerce world banking and have to open taxes on money transfers and carbon taxes
[1:35:41.320 --> 1:35:48.360]  i mean it's in the financial times of london every day but you got to say it doesn't exist
[1:35:51.000 --> 1:35:57.400]  look they're putting cancer viruses in your kids injections it's admitted okay they're putting
[1:35:57.400 --> 1:36:01.880]  deadly chemicals in the water that eat your brain and attack every organ in your body

[1:36:14.520 --> 1:36:23.480]  to us many scientists believe we would easily be living to 120 comfortably now folks people
[1:36:23.480 --> 1:36:30.680]  live to 100 routinely 50 60 80 100 years ago people live longer before you're like no they
[1:36:30.680 --> 1:36:38.520]  didn't look at the numbers take out infant mortality because a lot of babies died at birth
[1:36:38.520 --> 1:36:44.120]  and many people died by the age of five but once you got past that if you take out infant and child
[1:36:44.120 --> 1:36:52.520]  mortality people lived until their late 80s on average men it's like 74 now women 76
[1:36:52.520 --> 1:37:03.240]  they're killing us comprende you got that they're eugenicists they run the banking system
[1:37:05.960 --> 1:37:11.000]  you know i said i go to your calls i wonder how long this will be up on wikipedia
[1:37:12.120 --> 1:37:15.240]  this is not a conspiracy in full wars dot com history of the term
[1:37:15.240 --> 1:37:24.360]  and i've tried to change wikipedia misspelling my middle name emrick i've tried to change a lot

[1:37:28.680 --> 1:37:35.320]  won't let us do it the people they let run into these little neocon troglodytes who openly just
[1:37:35.320 --> 1:37:40.280]  make stuff up that's why it's not a very good source of info but the main line encyclopedia
[1:37:40.280 --> 1:37:46.040]  says it doesn't exist either i mean we'll have a world emperor walking around in gold outfits and
[1:37:46.040 --> 1:37:49.720]  they'll say it doesn't exist or or what they do is they're now saying since they're announcing

[1:40:44.760 --> 1:40:50.520]  out of a set up their own empire the west told them that we wanted them to japan was with the

[1:41:13.000 --> 1:41:20.360]  this overly the point is at the end of world war two which the british masterminds and the roth
[1:41:20.360 --> 1:41:33.320]  child masterminds orchestrated they went into japan they went into europe with the marshal plan
[1:41:33.320 --> 1:41:38.520]  again with reconstruction and that meant putting in public governments that mean creating fiat
[1:41:38.520 --> 1:41:44.120]  currencies setting up a power structure and keeping us troops there to make sure they follow
[1:41:44.120 --> 1:41:50.840]  the orders germany's totally run by the british japan's run by them it's all staged and that's

[1:42:19.160 --> 1:42:24.440]  for this brother and they went in there and they shut it up as their own personal cash machine
[1:42:24.440 --> 1:42:31.640]  they've always hated americans they've hated our bill of rights our constitution major editorials
[1:42:31.640 --> 1:42:35.800]  and major magazines and newspapers said we have to destroy the american system we have to destroy
[1:42:35.800 --> 1:42:39.880]  their own currency destroy their free market and they said how are we gonna do it socialize them
[1:42:39.880 --> 1:42:45.000]  create a depression get them used to going under government we'll do it so now here we are 80
[1:42:45.000 --> 1:42:53.880]  something years later after 1913 90 something years later here we are and they are now gonna
[1:42:53.880 --> 1:43:00.120]  fully bankrupt us just like they bankrupted germany and france and europe so we can be quote
[1:43:00.120 --> 1:43:07.480]  rebuilt in their image absolute slaves and folks it is gonna be bad unless we address the real issue
[1:43:07.480 --> 1:43:16.920]  and say no to it now and the oe cd says the xm banks say they want world taxes at at least 86
[1:43:16.920 --> 1:43:23.480]  percent they say the us is a tax haven and that under this new agreement they're gonna get our
[1:43:23.480 --> 1:43:29.480]  taxes harmonized at 80 plus percent just like they're doing in england just like they have in
[1:43:29.480 --> 1:43:35.880]  france this isn't a game and they've convinced the howling mob of idiots who want some more welfare
[1:43:35.880 --> 1:43:41.080]  and food stamps uh that if they rob the middle class they'll get more goodies
[1:43:44.440 --> 1:43:49.560]  and just like they did in japan or germany and in the marshal plan they're gonna use the howling mob
[1:43:49.560 --> 1:43:55.080]  and they're gonna give them little pieces of the pie little little crumbs to go along with all this
[1:43:55.080 --> 1:44:04.920]  is their soldiers their domestic thug force all these slack jobs spoiled brat idiots on power

[1:44:25.640 --> 1:44:30.520]  i told you before the bailout they were going to have a fake bailout and do that because they
[1:44:30.520 --> 1:44:37.080]  said they were going to do it that's the times of london they're investing in and leveraging it
[1:44:38.040 --> 1:44:41.720]  somebody needs to go back to the day they passed the bailout the day before rob was saying they're
[1:44:41.720 --> 1:44:46.680]  going to take the money and they're going to put it into commodities and they're going to leverage
[1:44:46.680 --> 1:44:51.160]  it and they are going to go in there and short and they're going to go in there and and they are
[1:44:51.160 --> 1:44:57.000]  going to put it into derivatives and and then they are now had hedge fund managers on yesterday
[1:44:57.000 --> 1:45:07.800]  saying that's the thing to do gamble with it so they can aggressively leverage the five trillion

[1:53:17.240 --> 1:53:23.400]  you're fired up good alec you're as usual on one level or the other you have the passion that's why
[1:53:23.400 --> 1:53:28.680]  you are in the position you're in i truly believe that you have a god-given passion for the truth and
[1:53:28.680 --> 1:53:34.360]  for just fighting everything that fights truth because everything that fights the truth is
[1:53:34.360 --> 1:53:42.200]  out to destroy everything that's good scumbag yuppies and smartmouth parasites like kashkari
[1:53:42.200 --> 1:53:46.280]  it's people like him that are causing all the death and starvation worldwide i have their own
[1:53:46.280 --> 1:53:51.720]  documents where they engineered it all and i know he's a mortal enemy of my family i hear you right
[1:53:51.720 --> 1:53:58.280]  there they're out to kill us all alec's alec's when it comes to mr kashkari and his arrogance
[1:53:58.280 --> 1:54:03.320]  that you've described in front of the oversight committee this morning his arrogance doesn't
[1:54:03.320 --> 1:54:10.600]  surprise me at all because of course he's privy to the actual weaponry which they have to enforce
[1:54:10.600 --> 1:54:16.920]  their will whatever their will would be within the illuminati and their political minions but
[1:54:16.920 --> 1:54:21.560]  still they don't have the people's minds they fall now once they have the robotic systems in
[1:54:21.560 --> 1:54:26.680]  place it's going to be a little bit tougher but still they fall and the arrogance is easily
[1:54:26.680 --> 1:54:31.400]  explainable at this point with what we know of the arsenal of actual weapons which they have to
[1:54:31.400 --> 1:54:37.400]  repress the will of the people and now they're repressing the will of the people's representatives
[1:54:37.400 --> 1:54:44.920]  and and the congress and it just shows how they feel and where they're at as to how they estimate
[1:54:44.920 --> 1:54:49.000]  their own power and i think they're giving themselves an accurate estimate i don't believe
[1:54:49.000 --> 1:54:53.720]  they've ever overestimated their power and any kind of they normally move carefully and now
[1:54:53.720 --> 1:55:00.040]  they're just they're like a giant boa that has us a little piggy all tied up strangling us crushing
[1:55:00.040 --> 1:55:05.880]  the life out of us right now and every time we cry out to help to the snake they just squeeze that
[1:55:05.880 --> 1:55:12.840]  much kiter and go i am helping you little piggy feel they have the upper hand in the rock obama
[1:55:12.840 --> 1:55:20.760]  will vote by obama obama it's like a little blind sheep that have had their legs cut off
[1:55:20.760 --> 1:55:25.960]  been dropped into a pit of giant snakes begging obama the snake to save them when he's just one
[1:55:25.960 --> 1:55:31.560]  little snake skittering along on the bottom with these big giant wroth child pythons well when you
[1:55:31.560 --> 1:55:38.200]  consider that it's estimated there's somewhere approaching 50 percent of the um um the people
[1:55:38.200 --> 1:55:44.280]  who are who can vote by law in this country and who voted i guess one way or another the the figure
[1:55:44.280 --> 1:55:49.880]  being floated is about half the country is uh actually for him and falling for this grand
[1:55:49.880 --> 1:55:54.920]  illusion that he's putting out because it's it's very essential but here's the deal when they get
[1:55:54.920 --> 1:56:00.440]  ripe though again even more of them will become disillusioned in the next time not be a zap to
[1:56:00.440 --> 1:56:06.280]  be fooled they are losing their credibility very very quickly alex i have a really uh i think a
[1:56:06.280 --> 1:56:12.760]  good idea that i'd like you to think about i tell me just to tell you real quick um i think you
[1:56:12.760 --> 1:56:19.000]  could probably organize a group of like-minded congressmen who we saw their their true colors
[1:56:19.000 --> 1:56:25.480]  as you've described it in this oversight hearing and that that have a deep passion for truth justice
[1:56:25.480 --> 1:56:29.000]  in the america when they're already on to look at these congressmen i can get the time of day from
[1:56:29.000 --> 1:56:33.640]  these people we're lucky to be able to bug them and get them on the radio even denis kucinich
[1:56:33.640 --> 1:56:38.280]  uh i mean i know him i mean i can get him on the air takes about a week well i just thought that
[1:56:38.280 --> 1:56:44.520]  perhaps uh even after the election but preferably before that a group of congressmen would want to
[1:56:44.520 --> 1:56:50.120]  come together that have a passion to see just don't let them get on the same airplane no no i hear
[1:56:50.120 --> 1:56:57.720]  you i i can barely live my life now so i can't do any more thank you for listening to gcm

[1:58:47.720 --> 1:58:50.680]  and generally your phone calls i'm not putting down
[1:58:50.680 --> 1:58:57.240]  on what the great caller mark and organ said about myself organizing the congressman
[1:58:57.240 --> 1:59:02.360]  the congressman don't want to be organized by me they are people fighting the mail out
[1:59:02.360 --> 1:59:06.920]  our diverse group of congressman most of them don't even know who i am i think a lot of listeners
[1:59:06.920 --> 1:59:12.200]  overestimate my stature the real power is you the listeners spreading the word and the information
[1:59:12.200 --> 1:59:20.920]  and the articles in the videos now that's what's at power but um i can't organize myself out of a
[1:59:20.920 --> 1:59:26.760]  wet paper bag these days i'm trying to do a bunch of projects make films get my studio done so um
[1:59:27.880 --> 1:59:31.240]  they did i mean they were on the capital hill today exposing how kashkari
[1:59:31.240 --> 1:59:36.920]  and the bankers are stealing all the money and national tv cut away from it and didn't give it
[1:59:36.920 --> 1:59:43.320]  any intention i mean i could probably get 200 congressmen organized that's all i did for a year
[1:59:43.320 --> 1:59:48.360]  and then have some meeting that no media would cover and now they're shutting down the free
[1:59:48.360 --> 1:59:53.480]  internet with a hundred different tactics we could get the public to admit it was happening we could
[1:59:53.480 --> 1:59:58.760]  stop it but that would take you know five minutes away from their football games so
[1:59:58.760 --> 2:00:04.920]  they will have everything they've got taken and they will go to work camps let's go ahead and talk
[2:00:04.920 --> 2:00:10.280]  to george in indiana go ahead george yeah alex uh i think i told you this once before but i've
[2:00:10.280 --> 2:00:16.840]  got source material for it uh obama had gotten on uh and and made a statement that if he were
[2:00:16.840 --> 2:00:21.480]  president that one of the things he wanted to do is gather all the muslim leaders together for a
[2:00:21.480 --> 2:00:28.680]  meeting and if you the source steven edmondson american jihad in the free press 2002 list the
[2:00:28.680 --> 2:00:35.400]  terrorist network in america and it's amazing well i mean the big tax-free foundations is very
[2:00:35.400 --> 2:00:41.400]  hommish reports fund the real muslim terror groups and absolutely through the big foundations
[2:00:42.360 --> 2:00:48.760]  they control the leftist terror groups and the low-grade morons actually carrying out the bombings
[2:00:48.760 --> 2:00:52.920]  don't even know what they're part of yeah well they could carry out a jihad here in the united
[2:00:52.920 --> 2:00:57.240]  states if that's what they wanted to do to order to bring in martial law yeah but that's you know
[2:00:57.240 --> 2:01:01.960]  what they're gonna release bird flu or something else or stage a nuke or maybe just use this economic
[2:01:01.960 --> 2:01:07.000]  collapse i mean the whole muslim thing in my opinion is way overrated i mean barack obama
[2:01:07.000 --> 2:01:12.440]  isn't a muslim i mean sure his daddy was he went to muslim schools what he is is a chameleon a new

[2:01:25.960 --> 2:01:32.520]  because he's you know appointing all these massages so i agree the muslims sure thought
[2:01:32.520 --> 2:01:38.600]  that he was their guy i mean how naive are all these groups how naive are white people
[2:01:38.600 --> 2:01:43.880]  black people anybody the guys that knew he's he was more for the bailout than bush and and and
[2:01:43.880 --> 2:01:50.280]  mccain he he's a total whore to these people i've got friends that still can't see it alex and

[2:03:44.040 --> 2:03:48.760]  dollars at least out of thin air this money now owns the american and european banks the
[2:03:48.760 --> 2:03:53.560]  exploding inflation that is now guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast

[2:03:59.240 --> 2:04:04.120]  inflation the cost of a loaf of bread doubled every two days until it reached over four billion
[2:04:04.120 --> 2:04:09.880]  marks food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end in sight the private
[2:04:09.880 --> 2:04:14.200]  banks merging with our government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock
[2:04:14.200 --> 2:04:19.160]  their shelves the stores have less food but jack of prices to stay in business whatever happens in
[2:04:19.160 --> 2:04:23.800]  america we need to be prepared and be ready everything is zeroing in on food one third of
[2:04:23.800 --> 2:04:28.440]  americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other necessities my friends whatever
[2:04:28.440 --> 2:04:33.320]  it takes get prepared get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening it's very

[2:06:12.520 --> 2:06:19.160]  of a major state as well what pennsylvania and he is the guy with obama crimes dot com
[2:06:19.160 --> 2:06:25.400]  who tried to figure it out who his daddy really was was he a u.s citizen eligible to run for
[2:06:25.400 --> 2:06:31.800]  president you know where was he really born and they acted very suspicious and covered all of this
[2:06:31.800 --> 2:06:37.880]  up and they also lie and say his dad wasn't a muslim now it's not an issue that his dad's a muslim
[2:06:37.880 --> 2:06:42.680]  it's that they lie about it when it's admitted they lie and say he wasn't muslim schools they lie
[2:06:42.680 --> 2:06:49.960]  about everything now this guy's a puppet but he certainly couldn't pass with what we know a security
[2:06:49.960 --> 2:06:55.480]  clearance so i wanted to get but he's now the president wanted to get phil burg is a democrat
[2:06:57.400 --> 2:07:02.120]  on and he's also member of the n double a cp in fact one of the heads in his community
[2:07:02.120 --> 2:07:07.400]  i wanted to get him on to talk about the supreme court where it went what happened
[2:07:07.400 --> 2:07:13.640]  in those hectic days in around the election phil burg thanks for coming on with us my pleasure
[2:07:13.640 --> 2:07:19.480]  i'm speaking to you from washington dc today had to come down here for some business to fulfill my
[2:07:19.480 --> 2:07:25.000]  desire for all americans so that the u.s constitution is followed i'm meeting with the people here
[2:07:25.000 --> 2:07:30.840]  who helped to hope to uh... help me my endeavors to see that our constitution is followed okay i'll
[2:07:30.840 --> 2:07:36.440]  give us chronologically if you can what happened right before the election what happened at the
[2:07:36.440 --> 2:07:40.440]  supreme court what happened with some of the other suits that others brought why they're
[2:07:40.440 --> 2:07:45.400]  being so secretive with the birth certificate claiming social security numbers can't be seen
[2:07:45.400 --> 2:07:51.080]  when social security numbers are not on birth certificates right i think the reason that
[2:07:51.080 --> 2:07:56.760]  nothing has been produced is because i think i'm right on target uh... one hundred or one
[2:07:56.760 --> 2:08:02.760]  thousand percent that uh... this is the biggest hoax ever attempted upon the american public in
[2:08:02.760 --> 2:08:07.960]  in the history of our government uh... brock obama
[2:08:07.960 --> 2:08:11.320]  toward constitutional law he's an attorney
[2:08:11.320 --> 2:08:16.040]  uh... when he was sworn into the u.s senate he swore to uphold the constitution
[2:08:16.040 --> 2:08:20.360]  and what's he done you know uh... he can't produce documentation that he meets the
[2:08:20.360 --> 2:08:24.040]  qualifications for president the qualifications are only three
[2:08:24.040 --> 2:08:29.000]  one you'd be thirty five years of age he is the other you've lived here in this country
[2:08:29.000 --> 2:08:33.800]  for fourteen straight years uh... and three that you'd be a natural born citizen
[2:08:33.800 --> 2:08:38.600]  he's not natural born i i can tell you right now that he was born in kenya
[2:08:38.600 --> 2:08:43.160]  but i can tell you even if you buy the argument that he was born in hawaii
[2:08:43.160 --> 2:08:47.720]  he would have lost his citizenship and people probably saying how can you lose your citizenship
[2:08:47.720 --> 2:08:53.720]  but let's just back up for a minute he was born in kenya and if your listeners have a
[2:08:53.720 --> 2:08:59.640]  if the father and mother are both from the citizens of the united states wherever the
[2:08:59.640 --> 2:09:03.000]  child is born like you know if your listeners go to uh...
[2:09:03.000 --> 2:09:07.320]  uh... mexico or jamaica or japan or how about even kenya
[2:09:07.320 --> 2:09:11.480]  and while on vacation they have a child as long as both parents are your citizens
[2:09:11.480 --> 2:09:14.120]  when they come back that child is considered natural born
[2:09:14.120 --> 2:09:18.120]  but that's not the situation with brock obama and he always and he says even
[2:09:18.120 --> 2:09:22.200]  to the village that he called himself a mutt when he's talking about the dog and he said
[2:09:22.200 --> 2:09:26.200]  he's a mutt he has a different background
[2:09:26.200 --> 2:09:30.040]  his mother was a u.s. citizen but his father was not well in that situation
[2:09:30.040 --> 2:09:32.760]  you have to look at the laws in effect at that time
[2:09:32.760 --> 2:09:38.040]  the law back and out august 4th 1961 was the fact that
[2:09:38.040 --> 2:09:42.200]  if only one parent is a u.s. citizen and the other parent is not
[2:09:42.200 --> 2:09:46.600]  um the u.s. citizen had to live in our country for 10 straight years
[2:09:46.600 --> 2:09:51.480]  which he did but five of those years had to be after the age of 14
[2:09:51.480 --> 2:09:56.200]  14 and 5 is 19 she delivered him when she's 18
[2:09:56.200 --> 2:09:59.080]  so according to law he's not natural born
[2:09:59.080 --> 2:10:02.280]  now some people are saying well that's only a technicality
[2:10:02.280 --> 2:10:05.400]  well it's the law the law is what the law is
[2:10:05.400 --> 2:10:09.320]  you can't just say it's a technicality so on that basis
[2:10:09.320 --> 2:10:13.400]  he's not natural born um because if he's born in kenya and
[2:10:13.400 --> 2:10:15.560]  let's look at what's going on in kenya right now
[2:10:15.560 --> 2:10:19.720]  um they're jumping up and down they had a national holiday this past monday
[2:10:19.720 --> 2:10:22.680]  and i've heard that they're going to mark his birthplace as a national
[2:10:22.680 --> 2:10:26.840]  extra line so i mean that's just more evidence that that's more evidence that
[2:10:26.840 --> 2:10:30.280]  he was and his grandmother is on video saying
[2:10:30.280 --> 2:10:33.640]  i was there when he was born in the village well
[2:10:33.640 --> 2:10:37.560]  one thing let me say the video is we've checked the translation on the video
[2:10:37.560 --> 2:10:40.600]  that is not accurate but we do have on our website
[2:10:40.600 --> 2:10:43.800]  an audio taken about three weeks ago by a minister
[2:10:43.800 --> 2:10:49.320]  um which it's in swahili but we have the translation also on our website which
[2:10:49.320 --> 2:10:53.320]  is obamacrimes.com where she says i was in the hospital
[2:10:53.320 --> 2:10:59.000]  when uh brock obama was born here in kenya but the video if you um
[2:10:59.000 --> 2:11:02.920]  get someone to translate what they're saying swahili it doesn't match what's
[2:11:02.920 --> 2:11:05.000]  on the english front i don't know who put that up
[2:11:05.000 --> 2:11:08.680]  see people are trying to uh turn it around and and try to take
[2:11:08.680 --> 2:11:13.320]  make people like me um be not considered well i mean
[2:11:13.320 --> 2:11:18.920]  i mean yeah they're they're planting uh you know tar babies or honeypots
[2:11:18.920 --> 2:11:22.920]  uh now the question i have for you is
[2:11:22.920 --> 2:11:27.800]  where does it go from here okay where we are right now is
[2:11:27.800 --> 2:11:32.200]  the i've uh the judge dismissed my case at the district court level
[2:11:32.200 --> 2:11:35.320]  and what i did is i appealed it to the third circuit but immediately to the
[2:11:35.320 --> 2:11:39.640]  u.s supreme court because times are wasting and the supreme court i i did
[2:11:39.640 --> 2:11:43.160]  file for an injunction to say the presidential election they didn't
[2:11:43.160 --> 2:11:47.160]  grant that but i could understand that because there's a whole election process
[2:11:47.160 --> 2:11:51.240]  involving people from school board to commissioner all the way up to president
[2:11:51.240 --> 2:11:54.360]  but the case is pending my written certiori is there
[2:11:54.360 --> 2:11:57.880]  of brock obama and the dnc and the other defendants have till
[2:11:57.880 --> 2:12:02.680]  uh december 1st to file a response they don't have to but that's a
[2:12:02.680 --> 2:12:06.360]  after that date and by that day we're having a number of individuals around
[2:12:06.360 --> 2:12:09.480]  the country file what's called a friend of the court brief
[2:12:09.480 --> 2:12:13.080]  and december 1st the court will decide whether to take the case or not
[2:12:13.080 --> 2:12:17.640]  i'm hopeful and i just spoke today to uh law school deans
[2:12:17.640 --> 2:12:21.880]  that they uh will take the case because in effect they're saying but that
[2:12:21.880 --> 2:12:25.720]  decision that no one has standing that no one has standing to bring us to the
[2:12:25.720 --> 2:12:29.320]  against the constitution which is really ridiculous especially on a
[2:12:29.320 --> 2:12:34.520]  constitutional requirement for president so if they take the case then
[2:12:34.520 --> 2:12:38.600]  depending what their decision is however i have also filed
[2:12:38.600 --> 2:12:42.840]  another action which is now under court seal so i can't discuss it but
[2:12:42.840 --> 2:12:47.560]  at the proper time i will discuss it um it's a it's a backdoor attempt to make
[2:12:47.560 --> 2:12:53.000]  him produce what he really is now in addition to that
[2:12:53.000 --> 2:12:55.960]  some people here at almond a meeting in washington dc
[2:12:55.960 --> 2:12:59.000]  some attorneys here just filed a suit in california
[2:12:59.000 --> 2:13:03.560]  um i think mississippi others are found lawsuits against the electors
[2:13:03.560 --> 2:13:07.400]  or it's as high as electors um obama is not president
[2:13:07.400 --> 2:13:11.080]  gunning president elected this one he got more votes but the votes where he
[2:13:11.080 --> 2:13:15.880]  don't mean anything under our system until december 15th when the electors
[2:13:15.880 --> 2:13:19.240]  meet in every state throughout of a nation and then
[2:13:19.240 --> 2:13:22.600]  it really isn't final at that point because then they send it to congress
[2:13:22.600 --> 2:13:26.520]  and it's the first or second week in congress congress meet if one
[2:13:26.520 --> 2:13:29.640]  um member of the house and one member of the senate
[2:13:29.640 --> 2:13:33.640]  raises questions then congress has to hold hearings so we're moving ahead on
[2:13:33.640 --> 2:13:37.160]  all these bases and we actually listeners to uh write to people and
[2:13:37.160 --> 2:13:39.400]  pressure even to write to all the u.s supreme court
[2:13:39.400 --> 2:13:43.480]  justices to express how they feel and we have their address on our website if
[2:13:43.480 --> 2:13:46.840]  you need that because this is like unconscionable
[2:13:46.840 --> 2:13:50.360]  you know it is like he either is a natural one citizen
[2:13:50.360 --> 2:13:54.040]  or he's not and if he is why haven't he produced the records
[2:13:54.040 --> 2:13:58.040]  it's very interesting that he hasn't produced any we know nothing about him
[2:13:58.040 --> 2:14:01.960]  well philberg speaking to that specifically
[2:14:01.960 --> 2:14:05.240]  i mean you're a democrat you're an in double acp guy you didn't have an
[2:14:05.240 --> 2:14:09.160]  axe to grind here you found out about this as you told me a few weeks ago in
[2:14:09.160 --> 2:14:12.920]  a month ago because uh you were researching it because
[2:14:12.920 --> 2:14:15.480]  you'd seen the challenges on the internet and didn't believe them
[2:14:15.480 --> 2:14:19.400]  and then found that where there was smoke that there was fire but regardless
[2:14:19.400 --> 2:14:22.440]  what the democratic party do they mean they could have found lots of
[2:14:22.440 --> 2:14:27.480]  qualified black americans uh who have been here for generation after generation
[2:14:27.480 --> 2:14:30.600]  can prove their pedigree i mean when you're talking about a president it
[2:14:30.600 --> 2:14:33.000]  didn't need to be all clouded and questionable
[2:14:33.000 --> 2:14:37.240]  i mean much less than a president whose father what never even really lived
[2:14:37.240 --> 2:14:40.600]  here and wasn't a u.s citizen and was a communist and
[2:14:40.600 --> 2:14:43.720]  i mean that alone and then all the weird marxist and
[2:14:43.720 --> 2:14:47.880]  i mean the establishment clearly can blackmail him with this now
[2:14:47.880 --> 2:14:52.120]  and whether it's true or not it's the covering up that's so suspicious and
[2:14:52.120 --> 2:14:56.520]  they have been doing that and the denial now by his followers
[2:14:56.520 --> 2:15:00.120]  i see them even denying that he proposed a one million man
[2:15:00.120 --> 2:15:03.800]  civilian intelligence force and compulsory draft
[2:15:03.800 --> 2:15:10.280]  when it was on uh change dot gov i mean i mean his followers are delusional
[2:15:10.280 --> 2:15:13.800]  right i mean what you're just referring to they put on their website
[2:15:13.800 --> 2:15:16.600]  and then there were so many complaints about they changed it now that they're
[2:15:16.600 --> 2:15:20.840]  not had it i mean you know we need some this is a candidate for change
[2:15:20.840 --> 2:15:24.840]  we need some honesty in government and and i i guess he fulfills that though
[2:15:24.840 --> 2:15:28.440]  he's a candidate for change because uh Arnold Schwarzenegger the governor
[2:15:28.440 --> 2:15:31.560]  of california had been talked to about running for government what did he say
[2:15:31.560 --> 2:15:35.080]  he said amend the constitution so i guess bronco bomb is a candidate for
[2:15:35.080 --> 2:15:38.040]  change because he says i can walk on the constitution i don't need
[2:15:38.040 --> 2:15:41.880]  constitution but you know what we need the constitution and we just not they
[2:15:41.880 --> 2:15:45.640]  may start claiming that schwarzenegger was born in the u.s
[2:15:45.640 --> 2:15:48.760]  and then if you say he wasn't they'll just say you're a conspiracy theorist
[2:15:48.760 --> 2:15:52.200]  you know right right uh what the schwarzenegger what he should have done
[2:15:52.200 --> 2:15:57.320]  is just filed according to the law proposed right now by obama
[2:15:57.320 --> 2:16:01.400]  schwarzenegger should just file that right you know i'm i'm natural born you know
[2:16:01.400 --> 2:16:04.840]  just i'm not going to listen to you that's what's absurd about this whole thing
[2:16:04.840 --> 2:16:07.000]  so we're going to proceed against the electors
[2:16:07.000 --> 2:16:11.400]  um we're going to do everything in our power we think we have to why didn't he
[2:16:11.400 --> 2:16:16.840]  just release it instead of a a a receipt for one that looks like it's fake many
[2:16:16.840 --> 2:16:20.120]  experts have looked at it why why not nip it in the bud
[2:16:20.120 --> 2:16:24.920]  it's become an internationally yeah go ahead because he wasn't born here
[2:16:24.920 --> 2:16:29.880]  i mean i mean look come on if a lawyer you know if let's take a criminal case
[2:16:29.880 --> 2:16:33.000]  hypothetical case they say my client committed this
[2:16:33.000 --> 2:16:36.760]  robbery and he committed and i'm from philadelphia but
[2:16:36.760 --> 2:16:40.680]  but that on that particular day he was in washington dc he was a guest of
[2:16:40.680 --> 2:16:44.680]  waiters okay specialist but wouldn't you produce evidence that he was in
[2:16:44.680 --> 2:16:47.720]  washington the wait house rather than have your client
[2:16:47.720 --> 2:16:51.400]  dragged through the mud so i mean the thing here is it's obviously they don't
[2:16:51.400 --> 2:16:54.760]  have a birth certificate because they wouldn't keep hanging their head
[2:16:54.760 --> 2:16:58.360]  on this certification of live birth which is the phony document
[2:16:58.360 --> 2:17:02.280]  which they put up on their website in june of 2008 that's what's significant
[2:17:02.280 --> 2:17:05.160]  that's before before i ever got involved in this case

[2:21:32.120 --> 2:21:36.280]  democrat and double acp head in his town
[2:21:37.560 --> 2:21:42.280]  really got worried about this constitutional crisis
[2:21:42.280 --> 2:21:46.280]  i mean the guy's dad is a foreigner he is a communist he is
[2:21:46.280 --> 2:21:49.560]  a muslim he did go to muslim schools his real name
[2:21:49.560 --> 2:21:55.960]  isn't even barack obama it's barry
[2:21:55.960 --> 2:21:59.800]  i mean it goes on and on and people are getting more and more upset about this
[2:21:59.800 --> 2:22:04.680]  phil you're talking about the media slandering you please continue
[2:22:04.680 --> 2:22:08.200]  well it's not that the mainstream media is just not covering it um it's not
[2:22:08.200 --> 2:22:11.160]  being they're not really doing now there's some people on the internet
[2:22:11.160 --> 2:22:14.440]  who are i think jealous of me they're putting all kinds of remarks up about
[2:22:14.440 --> 2:22:16.600]  me i don't want to give their names to give them any
[2:22:16.600 --> 2:22:18.760]  credence but we'll deal with those people but
[2:22:18.760 --> 2:22:22.040]  there's people out there saying they're reporting me and i did this wrong or
[2:22:22.040 --> 2:22:24.200]  did that wrong i have the case before the u.s.
[2:22:24.200 --> 2:22:28.280]  supreme court i've raised the knowledge of course this country of the question
[2:22:28.280 --> 2:22:31.400]  i think if nothing else that's a major accomplishment other people just trying
[2:22:31.400 --> 2:22:34.680]  to jump on the bandwagon and whoever wants to jump on i don't care because
[2:22:34.680 --> 2:22:37.720]  the bottom line is we gotta find out the truth here
[2:22:37.720 --> 2:22:41.960]  and the truth is in my opinion is that he's not natural born he has no business
[2:22:41.960 --> 2:22:44.760]  being president and i think really hopefully the criminal
[2:22:44.760 --> 2:22:47.400]  authorities will take a look at this after the fact because i think people
[2:22:47.400 --> 2:22:51.400]  like Howard Dean and other people to the mc
[2:22:51.400 --> 2:22:54.600]  rock obama michelle obama and his pop campaign people
[2:22:54.600 --> 2:22:57.880]  really are open themselves up to her great criminal charges because this is
[2:22:57.880 --> 2:23:02.840]  outrageous where do you go from here philberg
[2:23:02.840 --> 2:23:05.560]  well like i said we're waiting on the u.s. supreme court we're getting some
[2:23:05.560 --> 2:23:09.320]  friendly court briefs we'll be taking some action against the
[2:23:09.320 --> 2:23:13.400]  electors because electors can only go for a qualified candidate
[2:23:13.400 --> 2:23:17.080]  and i filed some other case which is now under seal so i can't discuss it right
[2:23:17.080 --> 2:23:20.760]  now but um in in short time that will come out
[2:23:20.760 --> 2:23:25.000]  but we're just doing everything we're gonna put together a uh we have a flyer
[2:23:25.000 --> 2:23:28.440]  i'm sorry a full page ad is out tomorrow
[2:23:28.440 --> 2:23:32.360]  in the um washington times the weekend edition
[2:23:32.360 --> 2:23:36.120]  and we're hoping to raise money to place ads in other papers across this
[2:23:36.120 --> 2:23:39.560]  country so that more and more people become aware of it because as people
[2:23:39.560 --> 2:23:43.560]  come aware of it even rock obama people they're saying are you for real
[2:23:43.560 --> 2:23:46.920]  and i'm saying yes because they're starting the question because
[2:23:46.920 --> 2:23:52.200]  if he ends up getting inaugurated we have a constitutional crisis here
[2:23:52.200 --> 2:23:56.040]  because anything any law he'd be like usurping the power
[2:23:56.040 --> 2:23:59.480]  and any law he signed into effect would not have a fact well any judge
[2:23:59.480 --> 2:24:02.760]  the ships are about to any of anything he did would be illegal
[2:24:02.760 --> 2:24:06.520]  well phil just on the face of this i mean again i'd love to have a black
[2:24:06.520 --> 2:24:09.240]  president i mean i mean i love how happy it's made
[2:24:09.240 --> 2:24:12.040]  folks people thinking there's not all this racism people not
[2:24:12.040 --> 2:24:15.400]  you know having all this weird guilt and the rest of it but the fact is it's a
[2:24:15.400 --> 2:24:19.320]  guy named a rock who's saying obama and i'm not somebody up here ever bashing
[2:24:19.320 --> 2:24:22.440]  foreigners or muslims but with all the fear mongering about it
[2:24:22.440 --> 2:24:27.000]  now suddenly this guy goes to communist schools foreign schools all these
[2:24:27.000 --> 2:24:32.040]  marxist linanists i mean you couldn't write a book a fiction novel
[2:24:32.040 --> 2:24:36.040]  this weird and then they're hiding and the governor
[2:24:36.040 --> 2:24:41.560]  is hiding his uh his uh birth certificate i mean it again i keep
[2:24:41.560 --> 2:24:45.240]  repeating that and then they lie and they call me a liar
[2:24:45.240 --> 2:24:48.600]  in the mainstream media and other places saying obama never called
[2:24:48.600 --> 2:24:52.600]  for um compulsory public service i mean
[2:24:52.600 --> 2:24:56.600]  his his chief of staff wrote a book about it uh he's talked about it they
[2:24:56.600 --> 2:24:59.160]  posted on his website i mean that's another example
[2:24:59.160 --> 2:25:02.840]  of the denial they're saying that i now am a
[2:25:02.840 --> 2:25:06.280]  fabricator and a liar and that that's not true i mean
[2:25:06.280 --> 2:25:11.720]  i've never this is cult like phil no it really is i saw that on the website
[2:25:11.720 --> 2:25:14.280]  myself so you know i don't get these people and
[2:25:14.280 --> 2:25:17.880]  what you have to do is to just protect yourself when this is when you see things
[2:25:17.880 --> 2:25:21.480]  on the website just download it you know put it someplace so we can have it
[2:25:21.480 --> 2:25:24.760]  here because if they're doing this this early
[2:25:24.760 --> 2:25:28.040]  then i hate to see what they're going to do when they become
[2:25:28.040 --> 2:25:32.360]  you know if he becomes a president and i hope that he doesn't
[2:25:32.360 --> 2:25:35.080]  well i want to do everything in our power well that's what i wanted to say are
[2:25:35.080 --> 2:25:37.960]  you watching your back
[2:25:37.960 --> 2:25:43.400]  i'm trying to have you had to have you had threats
[2:25:43.400 --> 2:25:49.640]  on now i have not any direct threats um you know i hope i talk about i don't get
[2:25:49.640 --> 2:25:53.400]  any um you know i've been just people coming be aware
[2:25:53.400 --> 2:25:56.920]  i think if something happened to me which i hope doesn't for my children
[2:25:56.920 --> 2:26:01.000]  grandchildren this would be a major front-page story so i think that's
[2:26:01.000 --> 2:26:04.520]  i think i have safety in in the following because i'm
[2:26:04.520 --> 2:26:08.440]  i'm so well known yeah that's like jim garrison said he's public so he's safe
[2:26:08.440 --> 2:26:12.280]  and i absolutely agree with you well obama crimes dot com i know you're really
[2:26:12.280 --> 2:26:15.880]  busy we're going to send a team up there to interview you for a barack obama
[2:26:15.880 --> 2:26:20.520]  piece i'm doing uh because uh you know i got blindsided by this guy the way he
[2:26:20.520 --> 2:26:22.760]  lies the way he said he didn't the war and
[2:26:22.760 --> 2:26:25.640]  not have illegal wiretapping and then he backtracked now he's going to have
[2:26:25.640 --> 2:26:29.320]  lobbyist uh in the white house i mean this guy
[2:26:29.320 --> 2:26:33.880]  this guy is making bill clinton look truthful
[2:26:33.880 --> 2:26:37.960]  that's interesting you know he you know he says whatever he's supposed to look
[2:26:37.960 --> 2:26:41.240]  the biggest example is and i'm basically doing the constitutional
[2:26:41.240 --> 2:26:44.200]  but reverend right is the prime example of how he switched
[2:26:44.200 --> 2:26:48.840]  we found out in april 2008 that reverend right made all these outlandish
[2:26:48.840 --> 2:26:53.320]  remarks so so what happens at that point we found out that he prayed with him
[2:26:53.320 --> 2:26:56.040]  not 20 months ago when he first announced his candidacy
[2:26:56.040 --> 2:26:58.840]  but he wouldn't allow a reverend right up on the platform
[2:26:58.840 --> 2:27:02.760]  well platform of the why not then that friday night in april when he went on
[2:27:02.760 --> 2:27:05.560]  all the he went on every cable tv show he could get on

[2:27:45.000 --> 2:27:49.160]  tell me where i was we left off with uh with a reverend right
[2:27:49.160 --> 2:27:53.000]  okay reverend right on that friday night he went on every tv show he could
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:57.000]  to say what to say i was never in a queue when reverend right made any of those
[2:27:57.000 --> 2:28:00.120]  remarks okay but by monday when he went to
[2:28:00.120 --> 2:28:04.600]  Philadelphia and he gave that famous rate the famous race speech which wasn't
[2:28:04.600 --> 2:28:07.400]  that famous i mean if you really read the speech it wasn't that good
[2:28:07.400 --> 2:28:11.880]  he's a delivery style which is fabulous uh when he's talking off a teleprompter
[2:28:11.880 --> 2:28:14.680]  but he split into a speech there something what he's sliding the speech
[2:28:14.680 --> 2:28:18.040]  he said i was in a queue when reverend right made the remarks people
[2:28:18.040 --> 2:28:21.400]  questioning so between friday night and sunday and monday
[2:28:21.400 --> 2:28:24.760]  he switched it split it in there most people probably didn't pick up that
[2:28:24.760 --> 2:28:27.640]  line in his speech but it just shows he switches
[2:28:27.640 --> 2:28:31.000]  he switches his thought process uh to
[2:28:31.000 --> 2:28:35.000]  go with whatever it appears that the people want to hear at that particular
[2:28:35.000 --> 2:28:40.280]  point and uh that's not a true honest person that we want
[2:28:40.280 --> 2:28:45.480]  well he's certainly a scary individual i mean i have never seen in us history
[2:28:45.480 --> 2:28:49.400]  a case where they were calling people the one the leader the president of the
[2:28:49.400 --> 2:28:53.160]  world uh here's a headline right here
[2:28:53.160 --> 2:28:57.480]  uh here's one uh it says barack obama vows to change the world
[2:28:57.480 --> 2:29:02.120]  that's for the prison planet dot tv here i'll give folks a document cam shot
[2:29:02.120 --> 2:29:05.960]  pull that up for me uh for folks watching
[2:29:05.960 --> 2:29:12.040]  again at uh prison planet dot tv i mean this is the type of headline
[2:29:12.040 --> 2:29:17.160]  that we've got literally by the hundreds barack obama vows to change the
[2:29:17.160 --> 2:29:20.520]  world uh you know he and well that's it
[2:29:20.520 --> 2:29:23.160]  yeah he wants to be the president of the world
[2:29:23.160 --> 2:29:25.960]  but you know what we need a president in the united states we need someone to
[2:29:25.960 --> 2:29:29.640]  restore the dignity of this country the honor of this country
[2:29:29.640 --> 2:29:32.760]  you know also you know remember there's still that photo of him standing there
[2:29:32.760 --> 2:29:36.520]  not to leave the american flag because he and michelle trouble the american flag
[2:29:36.520 --> 2:29:40.440]  he wants to change our national anthem because he wants it more more congenial
[2:29:40.440 --> 2:29:44.440]  for the middle east he doesn't like the word bombs bursting in air in there
[2:29:44.440 --> 2:29:48.200]  i mean if ever there's been a radical person who
[2:29:48.200 --> 2:29:53.160]  is trying to be president it's barack obama but the at the point is really
[2:29:53.160 --> 2:29:57.960]  um he's not qualified point blank he's not qualified not natural born
[2:29:57.960 --> 2:30:02.200]  and and really he should be arrested i mean i'm hoping that everyone out here
[2:30:02.200 --> 2:30:05.400]  i'm i'm hoping that the court system moves ahead
[2:30:05.400 --> 2:30:09.480]  as fast as we they can so this is a decision before inauguration
[2:30:09.480 --> 2:30:12.920]  all right phil bar we're gonna let you get back to the important work you're
[2:30:12.920 --> 2:30:15.640]  doing here in just a moment we're gonna come back to the full audience i want
[2:30:15.640 --> 2:30:19.480]  to talk about where you're going specifically you know the battle plan
[2:30:19.480 --> 2:30:22.920]  uh... and why you think barack obama needs to be quote
[2:30:22.920 --> 2:30:29.920]  uh... arrested here we go
[2:30:37.720 --> 2:30:41.920]  and his songs for jimmy fawn
[2:30:41.920 --> 2:30:48.920]  now we love chuck barry
[2:30:57.800 --> 2:31:00.600]  all right phil bird
[2:31:00.600 --> 2:31:02.240]  just got off a train
[2:31:02.240 --> 2:31:06.000]  twenty-something minutes ago we wanted to get back to his important work in dc
[2:31:06.000 --> 2:31:07.440]  uh... but uh...
[2:31:07.440 --> 2:31:11.880]  we're having back up the next few weeks and we're going to interview him up in uh...
[2:31:11.880 --> 2:31:15.320]  probably in philadelphia in the next few weeks and sent a crew up there
[2:31:15.320 --> 2:31:16.360]  uh...
[2:31:16.360 --> 2:31:20.600]  during the break when we were talking just on prison planet dot tv phil
[2:31:20.600 --> 2:31:23.960]  uh... you you talked about a barack obama needs to be arrested
[2:31:23.960 --> 2:31:26.240]  why does he need to be arrested
[2:31:26.240 --> 2:31:30.120]  well i think it would be i think that what he has done here
[2:31:30.120 --> 2:31:33.320]  in cohorts with his wife in cohorts with uh...
[2:31:33.320 --> 2:31:37.160]  uh... howard dean officials democrat national committee and his campaign
[2:31:37.160 --> 2:31:37.880]  staff
[2:31:37.880 --> 2:31:40.680]  is attempted to pull off the biggest hoax
[2:31:40.680 --> 2:31:42.280]  in the history of our country
[2:31:42.280 --> 2:31:45.200]  and it's an outright fraud i mean think about it
[2:31:45.200 --> 2:31:47.720]  he he's not qualified to be president
[2:31:47.720 --> 2:31:51.080]  and and he's coming up with the the media should be i wish we could do the
[2:31:51.080 --> 2:31:55.320]  media but i really think when it comes out to it if he's not a natural born
[2:31:55.320 --> 2:31:57.160]  uh... and i'm sure he's not
[2:31:57.160 --> 2:31:59.040]  because if he was first off
[2:31:59.040 --> 2:32:01.680]  if you want to start saying well there's technical issues
[2:32:01.680 --> 2:32:04.880]  other more than technical issues and if you thought they're only technical issues
[2:32:04.880 --> 2:32:06.000]  he should have
[2:32:06.000 --> 2:32:07.800]  then found a lawsuit
[2:32:07.800 --> 2:32:11.680]  two years ago before you know for president to clarify those issues
[2:32:11.680 --> 2:32:16.600]  he dot he hasn't he refuses to divulge information i think he hasn't we've
[2:32:16.600 --> 2:32:19.240]  releases college information because i believe
[2:32:19.240 --> 2:32:22.600]  uh... and i just got a couple things the law school today here
[2:32:22.600 --> 2:32:26.880]  we confirm it's probably on his application for law school or financial aid
[2:32:26.880 --> 2:32:30.440]  where he's a citizen of any probably put that he's a citizen of kentanya or
[2:32:30.440 --> 2:32:31.640]  indonesia
[2:32:31.640 --> 2:32:34.520]  and applied probably applied for receive foreign aid
[2:32:34.520 --> 2:32:37.600]  but you know we're asking for something called a birth certificate
[2:32:37.600 --> 2:32:40.720]  every one of your listeners out there has to produce it
[2:32:40.720 --> 2:32:43.960]  that many times of these things probably six times in a lifetime
[2:32:43.960 --> 2:32:46.840]  you know when they sign up for little league when they get baptized when they
[2:32:46.840 --> 2:32:48.040]  get married
[2:32:48.040 --> 2:32:51.120]  some states for driver's license for selective service
[2:32:51.120 --> 2:32:53.000]  for passport you know
[2:32:53.000 --> 2:32:55.720]  as many times you have to produce that document
[2:32:55.720 --> 2:32:58.200]  and why won't he produce his you know
[2:32:58.200 --> 2:33:00.560]  it's not even a defensive issue at this point
[2:33:00.560 --> 2:33:03.640]  because it's all over the internet there's mostly spending all around this
[2:33:03.640 --> 2:33:04.360]  country
[2:33:04.360 --> 2:33:06.960]  there's going to be more lost in spending because people are wondering
[2:33:06.960 --> 2:33:10.520]  is he natural born and if he's not natural born
[2:33:10.520 --> 2:33:14.560]  cannot be president states because it's one of the three basic requirements
[2:33:14.560 --> 2:33:15.640]  uh... of
[2:33:15.640 --> 2:33:18.440]  set forth in our constitution
[2:33:18.440 --> 2:33:22.120]  all right philburg uh... i want to speak as you're the expert on this really
[2:33:22.120 --> 2:33:24.920]  you know you know you're out there vetting what's true and what's not
[2:33:24.920 --> 2:33:27.880]  and you told me that it's not exactly that in swahili
[2:33:27.880 --> 2:33:31.440]  uh... with his grandmother saying that uh... he was born there but now that
[2:33:31.440 --> 2:33:35.680]  there's another audio tape that is in swahili where she does say it
[2:33:35.680 --> 2:33:37.080]  what about
[2:33:37.080 --> 2:33:38.560]  what we're seeing on
[2:33:38.560 --> 2:33:40.400]  mainstream news sites
[2:33:40.400 --> 2:33:43.520]  uh... these supposed documents of him in indonesia
[2:33:43.520 --> 2:33:47.240]  where he lists himself as a muslim and as a citizen
[2:33:47.240 --> 2:33:49.400]  of indonesia
[2:33:49.400 --> 2:33:52.440]  yeah i mean his name is named on the document which we have to other people
[2:33:52.440 --> 2:33:54.160]  about what's on our website
[2:33:54.160 --> 2:33:57.360]  uh... it says his name is barry sartoro
[2:33:57.360 --> 2:34:01.800]  uh... nationality indonesia if he hasn't changed
[2:34:01.800 --> 2:34:04.420]  his name since then
[2:34:04.420 --> 2:34:07.760]  legally changed his name his name is barry sartoro set another fraud in the
[2:34:07.760 --> 2:34:08.840]  american public
[2:34:08.840 --> 2:34:12.520]  when he found for the application to make the mint the chicago bar we put on
[2:34:12.520 --> 2:34:13.200]  there
[2:34:13.200 --> 2:34:15.080]  they have for his name and they put on their
[2:34:15.080 --> 2:34:19.400]  uh... but uh... brock who's saying obama extra other names and they said
[2:34:19.400 --> 2:34:20.200]  none
[2:34:20.200 --> 2:34:23.560]  so i mean he really has a lot of explaining to do it with you or i did
[2:34:23.560 --> 2:34:24.720]  something
[2:34:24.720 --> 2:34:27.600]  but i mean even time magazine
[2:34:27.600 --> 2:34:30.600]  uh... back when they were lovey-dovey you know six months ago said
[2:34:30.600 --> 2:34:31.880]  you know meet barry
[2:34:31.880 --> 2:34:33.400]  you know when he was buried
[2:34:33.400 --> 2:34:36.240]  and so it was known that he went by that name
[2:34:36.240 --> 2:34:39.880]  well all right so i mean it's it's it's a guy is a
[2:34:39.880 --> 2:34:43.520]  who is he and we don't even know he's not the president
[2:34:43.520 --> 2:34:47.200]  that we have that we have no idea who he is because he won't leave any
[2:34:47.200 --> 2:34:48.400]  documentation
[2:34:48.400 --> 2:34:50.880]  and i mean she media has refused
[2:34:50.880 --> 2:34:53.080]  has refused to ask many questions
[2:34:53.080 --> 2:34:55.120]  and look at governor palin recently
[2:34:55.120 --> 2:34:57.160]  she was totally better you know and
[2:34:57.160 --> 2:35:00.600]  they asked her everything under the sun and if you could do that that's fine
[2:35:00.600 --> 2:35:03.960]  they'll have to but how come they didn't do it brock obama how come the media
[2:35:03.960 --> 2:35:07.480]  that travels with him even today how come the media travel and they can't
[2:35:07.480 --> 2:35:08.520]  walk up to him say
[2:35:08.520 --> 2:35:11.120]  show us your birth certificate where we were born
[2:35:11.120 --> 2:35:12.780]  you know that they don't have
[2:35:12.780 --> 2:35:14.760]  they're a godless media right now
[2:35:14.760 --> 2:35:18.840]  it's controlled by a few corporations and it's really a good disgrace
[2:35:18.840 --> 2:35:22.760]  and uh... thankful for people like you who want to air this topic to the
[2:35:22.760 --> 2:35:24.080]  listeners out there
[2:35:24.080 --> 2:35:27.360]  the more and more people who know that are raising questions even even people
[2:35:27.360 --> 2:35:31.200]  democrats in people that have voted for him say is this for real
[2:35:31.200 --> 2:35:35.200]  well then they can't be president i don't want to know
[2:35:35.200 --> 2:35:37.600]  people want to know who he really is i uh...
[2:35:37.600 --> 2:35:40.800]  right you know i try to stay out of this you know i'm nonpartisan
[2:35:40.800 --> 2:35:44.200]  i'm a nine-eleven true they're just like yourself me you've got a lot of courage
[2:35:44.200 --> 2:35:45.920]  and i just
[2:35:45.920 --> 2:35:48.720]  tried to give him the benefit of the doubt and then the guy has been a
[2:35:48.720 --> 2:35:49.880]  complete liar
[2:35:49.880 --> 2:35:51.240]  on every policy
[2:35:51.240 --> 2:35:54.040]  i mean he's literally one eighty on everything before he even gets into
[2:35:54.040 --> 2:35:56.440]  office just throwing it in our face
[2:35:56.440 --> 2:36:01.600]  uh... the guy you did go by uh... the other name
[2:36:01.600 --> 2:36:04.640]  even the mainstream news before it was an issue said that
[2:36:04.640 --> 2:36:06.960]  uh... and uh...
[2:36:06.960 --> 2:36:09.120]  my god uh... i mean
[2:36:09.120 --> 2:36:11.960]  i guess he's really going to be the president and uh... he's going to be an
[2:36:11.960 --> 2:36:13.160]  imposter
[2:36:13.160 --> 2:36:16.560]  and then this is destroyed the market
[2:36:16.560 --> 2:36:17.800]  not if i can help it
[2:36:17.800 --> 2:36:18.720]  of that
[2:36:18.720 --> 2:36:22.480]  not if i can help it and the citizens all across this great nation
[2:36:22.480 --> 2:36:26.080]  who want to stand up and stand up for a constitution and make sure that's what
[2:36:26.080 --> 2:36:27.400]  we need people doing
[2:36:27.400 --> 2:36:30.680]  we need people right now to write every number the united supreme court say
[2:36:30.680 --> 2:36:31.960]  here this case
[2:36:31.960 --> 2:36:35.360]  and it's ridiculous that i don't have standing and also as a supreme court
[2:36:35.360 --> 2:36:37.840]  you know to make him produce his documentation
[2:36:37.840 --> 2:36:40.040]  that he is a natural born citizen
[2:36:40.040 --> 2:36:43.680]  and that's not you know that the uh... that the supreme court give instructions
[2:36:43.680 --> 2:36:44.840]  back to lower court
[2:36:44.840 --> 2:36:48.320]  to demand that he produces documents within a short time and i'm talking he
[2:36:48.320 --> 2:36:50.200]  should be able to produce these documents in
[2:36:50.200 --> 2:36:51.520]  within a week
[2:36:51.520 --> 2:36:56.400]  uh... and he can't produce and he should not be sworn as president
[2:36:56.400 --> 2:36:59.920]  well again if i was born in this country and somebody was running around for
[2:36:59.920 --> 2:37:02.260]  month after month getting international attention
[2:37:02.260 --> 2:37:04.440]  and tens of millions of internet views
[2:37:04.440 --> 2:37:06.600]  uh... of their website in their videos
[2:37:06.600 --> 2:37:09.240]  i mean i would release the birth certificate and again the governor came
[2:37:09.240 --> 2:37:11.600]  out and said it has his private information
[2:37:11.600 --> 2:37:13.920]  for identity theft is social security number
[2:37:13.920 --> 2:37:15.640]  that is a lie on its face
[2:37:15.640 --> 2:37:18.360]  social security numbers are not on birth certificates
[2:37:18.360 --> 2:37:21.760]  and back when he was born you didn't get one to your sixteen or fifteen started
[2:37:21.760 --> 2:37:22.740]  working
[2:37:22.740 --> 2:37:26.880]  and i mean that's what i got my mind i was like thirteen it is a lie
[2:37:26.880 --> 2:37:29.360]  and again everything we do is a lie
[2:37:29.360 --> 2:37:31.360]  and then now they won't release it
[2:37:31.360 --> 2:37:37.480]  and then his followers say yes they have no that is a receipt that is a receipt
[2:37:37.480 --> 2:37:39.560]  is it not
[2:37:39.560 --> 2:37:43.000]  well it's actually called a certification of live birth
[2:37:43.000 --> 2:37:45.920]  it's a post of the same information although last but
[2:37:45.920 --> 2:37:50.040]  our experts have showed that it is a phony it's a fraud it's been altered
[2:37:50.040 --> 2:37:53.280]  and the thing is even in the document the upper right hand corner the numbers
[2:37:53.280 --> 2:37:55.720]  blocked off why would you block that number off
[2:37:55.720 --> 2:37:59.240]  uh... that would never would be a succession number of the document and
[2:37:59.240 --> 2:38:01.880]  when you look at it up close their experts determined
[2:38:01.880 --> 2:38:04.720]  but the name my is underneath m a y a
[2:38:04.720 --> 2:38:05.920]  you know
[2:38:05.920 --> 2:38:07.760]  so that's why uh...
[2:38:07.760 --> 2:38:10.080]  that's why it's a phony document
[2:38:10.080 --> 2:38:12.900]  if you had a birth certificate put up the birth certificate and look at the
[2:38:12.900 --> 2:38:15.880]  website they posted it on is it true that answers
[2:38:15.880 --> 2:38:19.520]  is tied into the annenberg foundation that bankrolls him
[2:38:19.520 --> 2:38:23.240]  uh... fact check dot org uh... verified that it's true but fact that
[2:38:23.240 --> 2:38:25.880]  that org is owned by annenberg or chicago
[2:38:25.880 --> 2:38:27.960]  and that's where he sat on the board
[2:38:27.960 --> 2:38:30.440]  obama sat on the board there with bill ares
[2:38:30.440 --> 2:38:31.200]  so it is
[2:38:31.200 --> 2:38:35.600]  a little collusion perhaps for them to stand up for the board the certification
[2:38:35.600 --> 2:38:38.040]  of live birth is what it is
[2:38:38.040 --> 2:38:40.280]  it really is
[2:38:40.280 --> 2:38:43.440]  well they're trying to demoralize the country and all this comes out at will
[2:38:43.440 --> 2:38:46.600]  and i just feel sorry for black folks because when it comes out just with his
[2:38:46.600 --> 2:38:47.920]  policies alone
[2:38:47.920 --> 2:38:50.440]  this guy's total globalist trash
[2:38:50.440 --> 2:38:54.000]  uh... it's uh... i mean i would have if it's really gonna make our first black
[2:38:54.000 --> 2:38:55.440]  president look really bad
[2:38:55.440 --> 2:38:58.720]  philberg will talk to you soon i got my office calling you tomorrow when you get
[2:38:58.720 --> 2:39:02.000]  back to philadelphia and i appreciate all your time sir
[2:39:02.000 --> 2:39:07.080]  thank you pleasure folks should support you to obama crimes dot com thank you
[2:39:07.080 --> 2:39:10.240]  i think there goes philberg ladies and gentlemen
[2:39:10.240 --> 2:39:13.320]  by the way poll Watson wrote a big article
[2:39:13.320 --> 2:39:15.640]  it's up on prison planet dot com
[2:39:15.640 --> 2:39:21.040]  uh... with what i ran it about uh... back in the
[2:39:21.040 --> 2:39:25.480]  first hour of the show today kashkari accused of bailout bait and switch
[2:39:25.480 --> 2:39:27.520]  during angry hearing
[2:39:27.520 --> 2:39:29.360]  well i mean there's no accused
[2:39:29.360 --> 2:39:30.640]  of it they say
[2:39:30.640 --> 2:39:33.120]  we said we were gonna do this with the money now we're just keeping it for
[2:39:33.120 --> 2:39:35.040]  bonuses
[2:39:35.040 --> 2:39:39.180]  stuff on screen for prison planet dot tv folks
[2:39:39.180 --> 2:39:42.880]  paul joseph watson neil kashkari the
[2:39:42.880 --> 2:39:47.200]  fox appointed to guard the henhouse and front the multi trillion dollar bailout
[2:39:47.200 --> 2:39:51.200]  faced angry questions from dennis consent to represent the daryl isa
[2:39:51.200 --> 2:39:53.160]  during a hearing today
[2:39:53.160 --> 2:39:54.320]  as
[2:39:54.320 --> 2:39:58.080]  he's accused him of playing a bait and switch game with taxpayers money
[2:39:58.080 --> 2:40:00.060]  for some reason paul hasn't
[2:40:00.060 --> 2:40:04.600]  this is not up there yet the can dennis kassenich introducing him's what we need
[2:40:04.600 --> 2:40:06.960]  i mean dennis kassenich is first grilling
[2:40:06.960 --> 2:40:09.520]  and just telling him to stop lying to him is pretty powerful
[2:40:09.520 --> 2:40:11.740]  all the major networks a uh...
[2:40:11.740 --> 2:40:14.280]  before i forget is that i guess come up about forty five minutes
[2:40:14.280 --> 2:40:17.080]  will you go grab the two clips that watson does have
[2:40:17.080 --> 2:40:21.000]  up on prison planet dot dot dot com uh... john so i play these before uh...
[2:40:21.000 --> 2:40:24.200]  del rendis joins us and we will take your calls to come up a minute
[2:40:24.200 --> 2:40:26.840]  for those that are holding but we will grab those paul
[2:40:26.840 --> 2:40:27.920]  i mean uh...
[2:40:27.920 --> 2:40:31.240]  you grab paul story that the video clips in a john
[2:40:31.240 --> 2:40:33.240]  sure i'll grab it
[2:40:33.240 --> 2:40:35.840]  uh...
[2:40:35.840 --> 2:40:38.320]  it goes on uh...
[2:40:38.320 --> 2:40:42.400]  all the major networks carried footage of the u.s. house subcommittee hearing
[2:40:42.400 --> 2:40:45.520]  this morning and erin kashkari's opening statement in full
[2:40:45.520 --> 2:40:48.840]  but as soon as kassenich and he said we're about to weigh in the networks
[2:40:48.840 --> 2:40:50.360]  almost simultaneously cut
[2:40:50.360 --> 2:40:52.160]  defeated moved on to a different story
[2:40:52.160 --> 2:40:55.200]  another example of how the corporate media is on by the same elites
[2:40:55.200 --> 2:40:56.600]  and run the federal reserve
[2:40:56.600 --> 2:40:58.640]  kassenich accused paul sinan bush of
[2:40:58.640 --> 2:41:01.320]  circumventing congress by completely changing
[2:41:01.320 --> 2:41:05.480]  the destination of where the bailout money would go and refusing to disclose
[2:41:05.480 --> 2:41:07.400]  why
[2:41:07.400 --> 2:41:09.240]  they had taken without
[2:41:09.240 --> 2:41:11.280]  disclosing where it went
[2:41:11.280 --> 2:41:14.560]  and what happened to two trillion dollars of taxpayer money adding
[2:41:14.560 --> 2:41:16.880]  i think it's fairly obvious that congress
[2:41:16.880 --> 2:41:18.040]  would have never
[2:41:18.040 --> 2:41:21.400]  past the rescue plan had it known how treasury
[2:41:21.400 --> 2:41:22.960]  would
[2:41:22.960 --> 2:41:25.540]  marshal the resources it was given
[2:41:25.540 --> 2:41:29.640]  again it was on a rescue plan the bankers orchestrated this
[2:41:29.640 --> 2:41:31.040]  so of course they're not gonna
[2:41:31.040 --> 2:41:32.320]  give it to the people
[2:41:32.320 --> 2:41:34.320]  again i'm against giving to the people
[2:41:34.320 --> 2:41:36.560]  but if you're gonna have socialism
[2:41:36.560 --> 2:41:38.720]  and we're gonna pay it back in tax money
[2:41:38.720 --> 2:41:40.640]  and it's going to be value our currency
[2:41:40.640 --> 2:41:43.840]  it would help things compared to just giving it offshore banks
[2:41:43.840 --> 2:41:47.600]  to give it to the public
[2:41:47.600 --> 2:41:50.960]  may make some dependent and make some make bad decisions i mean of course the
[2:41:50.960 --> 2:41:51.760]  bankers
[2:41:51.760 --> 2:41:54.920]  suckered you of course they got you in debt and pulled the economy out from
[2:41:54.920 --> 2:41:55.480]  under you
[2:41:55.480 --> 2:41:59.080]  that's how they consolidate and set up the world government they're setting up
[2:41:59.080 --> 2:42:00.040]  this weekend
[2:42:00.040 --> 2:42:02.560]  called a new world order
[2:42:02.560 --> 2:42:06.720]  kusinich uh... battle with kashkari when it follows according to washington blog
[2:42:06.720 --> 2:42:08.160]  spot report
[2:42:08.160 --> 2:42:11.240]  i assure you the secretary is passionate about this cash car he said
[2:42:11.240 --> 2:42:13.680]  passion about what kusinich said
[2:42:13.680 --> 2:42:18.160]  helping homeowners kashkari replied where kusinich asked sarcastically what
[2:42:18.160 --> 2:42:19.120]  country
[2:42:19.120 --> 2:42:22.960]  we are using all the tools available to ease the credit crisis kashkari said
[2:42:22.960 --> 2:42:27.440]  let me give it give you an example kusinich interrupted kashkari continued
[2:42:27.440 --> 2:42:31.920]  his harangue well because kashkari already five or six times kusinich
[2:42:31.920 --> 2:42:35.720]  refused to answer the question and smiled at him like he'd just eaten a canary
[2:42:35.720 --> 2:42:38.560]  the big cheshire cat look at the guy looks like them the bad guy from the
[2:42:38.560 --> 2:42:39.560]  money
[2:42:39.560 --> 2:42:43.040]  uh... maybe this is a uh... game to some people in the administration
[2:42:43.040 --> 2:42:44.960]  they're on their way out of office and they
[2:42:44.960 --> 2:42:46.560]  do whatever they want said kusinich
[2:42:46.560 --> 2:42:49.240]  who tried to launch impeachment hearings against bush meanwhile people are
[2:42:49.240 --> 2:42:50.280]  hoping it's hope
[2:42:50.280 --> 2:42:53.560]  for help with their mortgages kashkari tried to explain
[2:42:53.560 --> 2:42:57.040]  why the seven hundred billion now five trillion two trillion they won't tell
[2:42:57.040 --> 2:42:57.920]  you where it went
[2:42:57.920 --> 2:43:01.280]  then we're gonna hear that seven hundred billion number forever folks
[2:43:01.280 --> 2:43:03.960]  kashkari tried to explain why the seven hundred billion was not used to buy
[2:43:03.960 --> 2:43:04.960]  trouble mortgages
[2:43:04.960 --> 2:43:07.960]  but kusinich would hear none of it
[2:43:07.960 --> 2:43:11.480]  shortly after president of daryl isa told kashkari you're here today because
[2:43:11.480 --> 2:43:13.120]  congress is convinced
[2:43:13.120 --> 2:43:14.720]  you played a bait and switch
[2:43:14.720 --> 2:43:17.320]  and you're not doing anything to convince us otherwise
[2:43:17.320 --> 2:43:20.160]  we don't need him to tell us they did a bait and switch they did
[2:43:20.160 --> 2:43:22.120]  they did it on the record
[2:43:22.120 --> 2:43:23.400]  but see that's like
[2:43:23.400 --> 2:43:26.000]  few months ago when oil
[2:43:26.000 --> 2:43:29.560]  you know was uh... six months ago when oil was one hundred fifty dollars a
[2:43:29.560 --> 2:43:32.600]  barrel and it was four dollars at the pump
[2:43:32.600 --> 2:43:36.280]  and the dollar was plunging
[2:43:36.280 --> 2:43:39.840]  perino the white house press secretary had all the press conference
[2:43:39.840 --> 2:43:40.720]  people going
[2:43:40.720 --> 2:43:44.280]  is it true the dollars bendy value can the president tell us
[2:43:44.280 --> 2:43:46.640]  as if they couldn't look at the currency indexes
[2:43:46.640 --> 2:43:51.400]  she said i'm not allowed to answer that i'd be fired if i told you
[2:43:51.400 --> 2:43:54.480]  i mean just showing a total breakdown of the white house
[2:43:54.480 --> 2:43:56.720]  because they were nothing their puppets
[2:43:56.720 --> 2:43:58.200]  they're just a front
[2:43:58.200 --> 2:44:01.480]  she's out there kind of throwing a fit on tv saying i'll be fired about tell you
[2:44:01.480 --> 2:44:04.200]  like we need you to tell us it's a bait and switch
[2:44:04.200 --> 2:44:06.040]  like we need you to tell us
[2:44:06.040 --> 2:44:08.000]  uh... that uh...
[2:44:08.000 --> 2:44:14.280]  that the dollars bindi valued i mean it's it's it's it's

[2:53:38.080 --> 2:53:39.800]  the pattern of events
[2:53:39.800 --> 2:53:42.520]  and and the rate at which they're
[2:53:42.520 --> 2:53:44.440]  aggressively increasing
[2:53:44.440 --> 2:53:48.320]  that this is exactly what's being set up right now
[2:53:48.320 --> 2:53:51.560]  oh yeah they stage nine eleven and then let it come out but but make it look
[2:53:51.560 --> 2:53:54.880]  like just the u.s. government did it uh... i mean they're i mean they're doing
[2:53:54.880 --> 2:53:57.360]  the same thing all over the world right now
[2:53:57.360 --> 2:54:00.800]  and then uh... they have all the world leaders in the treasury secretary come
[2:54:00.800 --> 2:54:02.920]  out and say america says two days ago
[2:54:02.920 --> 2:54:04.320]  america

[2:54:13.920 --> 2:54:15.680]  we're gonna pay higher taxes
[2:54:15.680 --> 2:54:17.280]  because it's our fault
[2:54:17.280 --> 2:54:18.480]  and then the world
[2:54:18.480 --> 2:54:22.000]  out of their anti-americanism that bush was designed to create
[2:54:22.000 --> 2:54:23.360]  and to bring to a head
[2:54:23.360 --> 2:54:24.560]  they then
[2:54:24.560 --> 2:54:29.040]  whoever says they're anti-american they'll pile on with
[2:54:29.040 --> 2:54:32.840]  and uh... europe will now go along with that like we'll show that george bush

[2:57:54.720 --> 2:57:56.360]  two days ago
[2:57:56.360 --> 2:57:57.960]  played right now
[2:57:57.960 --> 2:58:00.080]  and just total bold
[2:58:00.080 --> 2:58:01.920]  uh...
[2:58:01.920 --> 2:58:05.880]  the fed chief saying former fed chief saying the feds above the law
[2:58:05.880 --> 2:58:10.060]  i mean this is just criminals flaunting it
[2:58:10.060 --> 2:58:12.080]  in our faces
[2:58:12.080 --> 2:58:19.080]  uh... let's uh... go ahead and uh...
[2:58:19.400 --> 2:58:25.140]  let's go ahead and uh... go back to
[2:58:25.140 --> 2:58:27.640]  tony in canada go ahead tony
[2:58:27.640 --> 2:58:29.480]  by alex
[2:58:29.480 --> 2:58:33.680]  yeah it's like these elites uh... i i i i have a distinct impression of kind of
[2:58:33.680 --> 2:58:34.680]  like
[2:58:34.680 --> 2:58:38.280]  you know the guys are looting looting the path of the bank because they know it's
[2:58:38.280 --> 2:58:39.320]  going to collapse
[2:58:39.320 --> 2:58:43.440]  the whole thing is coming down in orchestrated at the planned
[2:58:43.440 --> 2:58:46.200]  and i remember listening to three or four years ago
[2:58:46.200 --> 2:58:49.160]  thinking you know this guy's a little bit over the top
[2:58:49.160 --> 2:58:50.960]  uh... you know i mean you do
[2:58:50.960 --> 2:58:55.080]  do tend to you know i am i don't know no i mean i'm intellectually accurate
[2:58:55.080 --> 2:58:56.520]  but then
[2:58:56.520 --> 2:59:01.800]  and information is accurate but no i i i have gone crazy knowing information
[2:59:01.800 --> 2:59:03.600]  well you know i don't blame you know because
[2:59:03.600 --> 2:59:06.800]  you know everybody i talk to encourage them i think i'll listen to this guy
[2:59:06.800 --> 2:59:08.760]  because he's got it right
[2:59:08.760 --> 2:59:11.480]  you know as nasty as it is to hear the bad news
[2:59:11.480 --> 2:59:13.080]  and it might ruin your day
[2:59:13.080 --> 2:59:16.080]  you gotta know about this stuff right and i'm i'm telling all your listeners
[2:59:16.080 --> 2:59:16.920]  out there
[2:59:16.920 --> 2:59:21.520]  but i think we're going to be lucky to make it through to christmas
[2:59:21.520 --> 2:59:23.880]  well what's scary is
[2:59:23.880 --> 2:59:28.600]  i've never seen them act like this tony i mean i've never seen a government this
[2:59:28.600 --> 2:59:30.360]  while this criminal
[2:59:30.360 --> 2:59:32.160]  this out in the open i mean
[2:59:32.160 --> 2:59:36.440]  not the nazis not the soviets i mean this is
[2:59:36.440 --> 2:59:40.640]  when you talk about financial criminal act i mean this is openly stealing money
[2:59:40.640 --> 2:59:44.920]  right in front of everybody and laughing at us and then will
[2:59:44.920 --> 2:59:48.080]  i mean i mean there's never been anything like it and they're openly setting up
[2:59:48.080 --> 2:59:54.600]  world government run by the bankers that did it
[2:59:54.600 --> 2:59:59.040]  well i i don't know about you were alec but i rely a lot of my intuition and i
[2:59:59.040 --> 2:59:59.560]  think
[2:59:59.560 --> 3:00:03.120]  when i was listening to you on the election night when obama got elected
[3:00:03.120 --> 3:00:07.520]  you know all day i was walking around with that real thinking feeling
[3:00:07.520 --> 3:00:09.760]  i haven't felt that bad
[3:00:09.760 --> 3:00:12.200]  in a long time it was kind of like
[3:00:12.200 --> 3:00:13.840]  you know okay this is it
[3:00:13.840 --> 3:00:14.840]  it's here
[3:00:14.840 --> 3:00:19.440]  and again it was it was a black guy it was watching the zombies the slickness
[3:00:19.440 --> 3:00:21.040]  the slickness of the speech
[3:00:21.040 --> 3:00:23.800]  like a hollywood movie with epic music playing when he
[3:00:23.800 --> 3:00:25.120]  had his victory speech
[3:00:25.120 --> 3:00:29.160]  it was it all was staged and i'm exactly i've never
[3:00:29.160 --> 3:00:32.320]  i've had this feeling a dread now for about six months but it intensified that
[3:00:32.320 --> 3:00:35.860]  night and now it's just resolved to fight it but yeah dread
[3:00:35.860 --> 3:00:39.260]  dread i am dreading what's happening i appreciate your call good points
[3:00:39.260 --> 3:00:43.360]  uh... let's talk to rick and indiana rick you're on the air
[3:00:43.360 --> 3:00:44.160]  uh...
[3:00:44.160 --> 3:00:47.760]  i don't know i'll listen and i got a lot of you i went to a brocco barma
[3:00:47.760 --> 3:00:51.440]  speech uh... in south indiana when he came to washington high school and the
[3:00:51.440 --> 3:00:53.280]  very first thing he did
[3:00:53.280 --> 3:00:55.600]  the very first thing he did
[3:00:55.600 --> 3:00:57.520]  was he can graduated
[3:00:57.520 --> 3:00:58.720]  tim roemer
[3:00:58.720 --> 3:01:02.200]  for all the hard work that he did
[3:01:02.200 --> 3:01:04.560]  nine eleven commission
[3:01:04.560 --> 3:01:07.080]  that was a very first thing that he did
[3:01:07.080 --> 3:01:09.880]  right then and i went there not to support what they're just to hear what
[3:01:09.880 --> 3:01:12.440]  he had to say i want to hear what this guy to say when you hear and speak on
[3:01:12.440 --> 3:01:13.880]  to see what the
[3:01:13.880 --> 3:01:15.880]  i was like one of two of the big
[3:01:15.880 --> 3:01:18.920]  rush was about there say we're gonna be tested they're gonna blow a bunch of
[3:01:18.920 --> 3:01:22.120]  stuff up and he's gonna grandstand all the conservatives are loving and they're
[3:01:22.120 --> 3:01:22.620]  gonna
[3:01:22.620 --> 3:01:24.200]  start arresting people go ahead
[3:01:24.200 --> 3:01:27.320]  well and and one of the other things i would get the car on yesterday
[3:01:27.320 --> 3:01:29.160]  yeah
[3:01:29.160 --> 3:01:32.520]  you know he made some really good points and i think that
[3:01:32.520 --> 3:01:36.120]  a lot of us are missing out on that the the secondary war
[3:01:36.120 --> 3:01:38.600]  is actually the one that's here in our skin
[3:01:38.600 --> 3:01:40.720]  the other war started a long time ago
[3:01:40.720 --> 3:01:44.320]  and that's what people need to realize and and i i i talked to before i told
[3:01:44.320 --> 3:01:47.280]  you before man just keep your heart soft as much as you can and you have got
[3:01:47.280 --> 3:01:49.000]  not before and that's great
[3:01:49.000 --> 3:01:51.640]  i understand the emotional side and and actually
[3:01:51.640 --> 3:01:54.720]  it was when you dressed up like a carpenter on time ago they got me hooked
[3:01:54.720 --> 3:01:58.840]  on you because i thought that guy
[3:01:58.840 --> 3:02:01.880]  and i just i have to i have to command you man because you know what you
[3:02:01.880 --> 3:02:06.040]  you've uh you've inspired me to be a man of truth
[3:02:06.040 --> 3:02:09.880]  a man to seek out truth and all things
[3:02:09.880 --> 3:02:13.720]  and um you know you're a wise man Alex you're a wise man and
[3:02:13.720 --> 3:02:16.840]  and to be honest i don't know how in the world your wife puts up with you because
[3:02:16.840 --> 3:02:18.760]  i guarantee you're not leaving this stuff
[3:02:18.760 --> 3:02:22.040]  hold on hold on just a minute hold on just a minute there
[3:02:22.040 --> 3:02:25.720]  hello friends this is Alex Jones i've told you for a long time it's important
[3:02:25.720 --> 3:02:28.520]  to be self-sufficient and today that's more important than ever
[3:02:28.520 --> 3:02:32.120]  we need to be independent and food and water is the key you'll never have to
[3:02:32.120 --> 3:02:34.520]  stand in a bread line if you have your own bread
[3:02:34.520 --> 3:02:37.720]  you'll never have to go to the super dome and beg for female to take care of
[3:02:37.720 --> 3:02:40.600]  your family in any emergency if you simply prepare
[3:02:40.600 --> 3:02:43.880]  our elected representatives wanted a good old boy bailout for the special
[3:02:43.880 --> 3:02:46.440]  interest so they ignored your screams not to do it
[3:02:46.440 --> 3:02:50.040]  they turned off the telephones and email they voted to print $850
[3:02:50.040 --> 3:02:53.080]  billion at least out of thin air this money now
[3:02:53.080 --> 3:02:56.760]  owns the america and european banks the exploding inflation that is now
[3:02:56.760 --> 3:03:00.520]  guaranteed will slash your life savings to nothing and blast the cost of
[3:03:00.520 --> 3:03:03.640]  necessities particularly food beyond many americans
[3:03:03.640 --> 3:03:07.560]  reach in pre-nancy germany super inflation the cost of a loaf of bread
[3:03:07.560 --> 3:03:11.240]  doubled every two days until it reached over four billion marks
[3:03:11.240 --> 3:03:15.160]  food prices are skyrocketing so fast there seems as if there may be no end
[3:03:15.160 --> 3:03:17.640]  in sight the private banks merging with our
[3:03:17.640 --> 3:03:20.760]  government are refusing to loan grocery stores enough money to restock their
[3:03:20.760 --> 3:03:23.800]  shelves the stores have less food but jack up prices to
[3:03:23.800 --> 3:03:27.560]  stay in business whatever happens in america we need to be prepared and be
[3:03:27.560 --> 3:03:30.120]  ready everything is zeroing out on food one-third
[3:03:30.120 --> 3:03:33.080]  of americans have to choose between buying food and paying for other
[3:03:33.080 --> 3:03:36.280]  necessities my friends whatever it takes get prepared
[3:03:36.280 --> 3:03:39.720]  get self-sufficient get food for everybody out there listening it's very
[3:03:39.720 --> 3:03:42.840]  important for you to understand that by having a supply of storable food the
[3:03:42.840 --> 3:03:46.120]  government the new old order has a lot less control over you and so it's a
[3:03:46.120 --> 3:03:49.480]  mindset a mindset of self-sufficiency and preparedness
[3:03:49.480 --> 3:03:52.680]  no one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you

[3:10:08.200 --> 3:10:15.320]  let me now go to some of the other clips
[3:10:15.400 --> 3:10:18.840]  john it's a good thing that you have it all up there in your computer because my
[3:10:18.840 --> 3:10:23.400]  uh computer is acting weird and i want to play this out of the network
[3:10:23.400 --> 3:10:27.000]  computer uh do you have that first clip that i sent you

[3:10:36.200 --> 3:10:39.560]  and down specific parts i mean i've only been able to watch an hour of it live
[3:10:39.560 --> 3:10:43.640]  this morning it just ended about an hour ago
[3:10:43.640 --> 3:10:48.360]  but here is uh one of the clips right now for you um
[3:10:48.360 --> 3:10:53.160]  this is where congressman issa is trying to nail him down and and the way he
[3:10:53.160 --> 3:10:58.280]  lies and weevils and and and and and never answers the question
[3:10:58.280 --> 3:11:02.680]  um you got to watch the body language radio takes a lot away from this but
[3:11:02.680 --> 3:11:07.480]  you can watch the videos up at prism planet dot com here it is
[3:11:08.360 --> 3:11:12.120]  okay my computer scrolls secondly
[3:11:13.000 --> 3:11:20.760]  it has been said that your purchases of 250 billion plus a preferred stock
[3:11:20.760 --> 3:11:25.160]  is at a price that would not be market competitive
[3:11:25.160 --> 3:11:29.720]  meaning you paid too much tell me why i'm to believe for a minute
[3:11:29.720 --> 3:11:34.680]  that those preferred stocks that you bought
[3:11:34.680 --> 3:11:38.360]  you could resell today for anything close remember the market has improved
[3:11:38.360 --> 3:11:41.560]  you've said that tell me what the profit would be on those
[3:11:41.560 --> 3:11:44.840]  those preferred stocks if you put them began putting even one dollar amount to
[3:11:44.840 --> 3:11:48.760]  the market today our congressman i don't know what the what the price
[3:11:48.760 --> 3:11:51.080]  would be okay well you're from goldman sacks
[3:11:51.080 --> 3:11:55.000]  you know used to work there okay well from and i'm from directed electronics
[3:11:55.000 --> 3:12:00.440]  you're from your last job if if you tell me that you've improved the
[3:12:00.440 --> 3:12:05.080]  market then by definition those assets if bought at par
[3:12:05.080 --> 3:12:09.320]  have appreciated isn't that true well there are many
[3:12:09.320 --> 3:12:11.720]  again with deep respect congressman there are many different markets there's
[3:12:11.720 --> 3:12:13.800]  the equity market there's the credit markets
[3:12:13.800 --> 3:12:17.000]  i think there are strong signs i can walk you through data showing the credit
[3:12:17.000 --> 3:12:20.120]  markets improving the equity markets we purchase equity
[3:12:20.120 --> 3:12:23.240]  the equity market you don't purchase the debt instrument
[3:12:23.240 --> 3:12:27.640]  well it's it's tier one capital congressman you know we can go ring around
[3:12:27.640 --> 3:12:31.480]  the rosy here but you're here today because congress is
[3:12:31.480 --> 3:12:34.760]  feeling that you played a bait and switch game
[3:12:34.760 --> 3:12:37.880]  and you're not convincing anyone that you haven't but let's
[3:12:37.880 --> 3:12:41.720]  let's just try to go to the fundamentals you bought preferred stock
[3:12:41.720 --> 3:12:45.400]  yes sir preferred stock is a debt instrument you're capitalizing the
[3:12:45.400 --> 3:12:48.360]  company but you're capitalizing with a debt instrument
[3:12:48.360 --> 3:12:52.440]  those instruments trade i have bb and t i have
[3:12:52.440 --> 3:12:57.720]  uh... well i have a number of of of debt instruments of that sort
[3:12:57.720 --> 3:13:01.800]  they have in fact appreciated from the time you bought
[3:13:01.800 --> 3:13:06.920]  till today in in various portfolios so i'm looking at those and i'm following a
[3:13:06.920 --> 3:13:10.920]  lot more of those kinds of instruments they have appreciated
[3:13:10.920 --> 3:13:16.520]  so my question today under oath as someone who should know about this is
[3:13:16.520 --> 3:13:22.760]  are your purchases above par today in your opinion
[3:13:22.760 --> 3:13:26.040]  candidly congressman i don't know we have an independent valuation firms
[3:13:26.040 --> 3:13:29.320]  that are going to provide a regular reporting on the current not a regular
[3:13:29.320 --> 3:13:32.840]  reporting starting when you're here today do you have any regular reporting
[3:13:32.840 --> 3:13:36.520]  from the day you bought until today we've we've published the reports to the
[3:13:36.520 --> 3:13:39.640]  treasury website within 48 hours of completing the
[3:13:39.640 --> 3:13:43.640]  transactions on the terms and then we're right now we're in the process just
[3:13:43.640 --> 3:13:46.680]  yesterday the equity asset manager solicitations
[3:13:46.680 --> 3:13:49.880]  concluded and we've received i think hundreds of proposals
[3:13:49.880 --> 3:13:53.240]  will be engaging the equity asset managers who will be providing us the
[3:13:53.240 --> 3:13:55.800]  valuation services and the reporting to the congress
[3:13:55.800 --> 3:13:59.080]  on a go-forward basis wouldn't it be reasonable
[3:13:59.080 --> 3:14:02.760]  for us to believe here today that if in fact
[3:14:02.760 --> 3:14:06.280]  you have improved the market that those assets that you
[3:14:06.280 --> 3:14:10.840]  purchase will call them equities since they're a hybrid
[3:14:10.840 --> 3:14:14.920]  have appreciated i think they'd be reasonable
[3:14:14.920 --> 3:14:18.920]  if relative to the day that we bought okay so if if we find out
[3:14:18.920 --> 3:14:22.280]  on the next report which i hope is forthcoming and we will be looking for
[3:14:22.280 --> 3:14:26.680]  it that they are the low par that in fact you paid too
[3:14:26.680 --> 3:14:30.200]  much right well it depends congressman
[3:14:30.200 --> 3:14:34.040]  what our objective was our objective was to create a program
[3:14:34.040 --> 3:14:37.400]  that would encourage thousands of banks across our country
[3:14:37.400 --> 3:14:41.240]  to voluntarily apply and to use the capital and so we intentionally made it
[3:14:41.240 --> 3:14:45.080]  attractive for them to want to apply so you believe here today that you had
[3:14:45.080 --> 3:14:48.600]  authority to subsidize banks including providing
[3:14:48.600 --> 3:14:53.400]  them this capital at a below par a below fair market
[3:14:53.400 --> 3:14:56.600]  of a market that should have existed but didn't exist
[3:14:56.600 --> 3:14:59.800]  well congressman as you know that the market when we did this
[3:14:59.800 --> 3:15:03.480]  was there wasn't a market company most banks couldn't raise private
[3:15:03.480 --> 3:15:07.080]  capital but we're no no but we're in a better market today
[3:15:07.080 --> 3:15:10.440]  you understand the one of the reasons for the question is you've you've thrown
[3:15:10.440 --> 3:15:14.440]  350 billion including aig and so on out there you're coming back for another
[3:15:14.440 --> 3:15:18.520]  350 billion if in fact what we've we discover
[3:15:18.520 --> 3:15:24.200]  and i believe here today is that you're 350 billion and let's just look at 250
[3:15:24.200 --> 3:15:26.600]  billion we leave aig which is a whole nother
[3:15:26.600 --> 3:15:31.080]  can of arms aside if that money in fact is a subsidy
[3:15:31.080 --> 3:15:34.520]  arriving at a price below the fair market price
[3:15:34.520 --> 3:15:39.320]  thus causing banks to choose you including banks in my district
[3:15:39.320 --> 3:15:43.720]  choose you instead of other capital all you've really done is give them a
[3:15:43.720 --> 3:15:48.760]  discount capital now the reason i ask that is how large is the capital base
[3:15:48.760 --> 3:15:53.960]  necessary for the banking industry and they go on to say 55 trillion so this
[3:15:53.960 --> 3:15:56.280]  does nothing they're just stealing the money
[3:15:56.280 --> 3:16:00.040]  in the final equation and they won't tell us where two trillion went
[3:16:00.040 --> 3:16:02.680]  we'll be right back after this quick break right here on the tc and radio
[3:16:02.680 --> 3:16:06.760]  network with a lot more stay with us
[3:16:09.000 --> 3:16:13.320]  alex jones here with a alex jones here to go back to the calls john
[3:16:13.320 --> 3:16:16.440]  let's go ahead and take some calls and and let me explain callers you're not on
[3:16:16.440 --> 3:16:19.640]  the am and fm now you're not on the shortwave or satellite but you're on
[3:16:19.640 --> 3:16:23.240]  the internet with tens of thousands listening on the audio thousands
[3:16:23.240 --> 3:16:26.840]  watching on the video and so it will then be posted at prison planet on tv it
[3:16:26.840 --> 3:16:30.360]  will be ripped to youtube so you will live on forever with your comments
[3:16:30.360 --> 3:16:34.120]  it's better to go to you behind the scenes than never get to your calls
[3:16:34.120 --> 3:16:37.880]  so uh... that is what i'm doing right now
[3:16:37.880 --> 3:16:42.680]  uh... let us go ahead and talk to kyle in pa lindsey josh blake i'm going to

[3:16:58.600 --> 3:16:59.800]  uh...
[3:16:59.800 --> 3:17:03.560]  got off the subject on the bailout but i had
[3:17:03.560 --> 3:17:07.160]  gotten some information in red about it i'm sure you've heard of that red list
[3:17:07.160 --> 3:17:09.640]  blue list fema thing
[3:17:09.640 --> 3:17:13.080]  okay well of course got on google found out
[3:17:13.080 --> 3:17:17.000]  you know different things on that and this is just for some people it's uh...
[3:17:17.000 --> 3:17:18.920]  uh... interesting to me
[3:17:18.920 --> 3:17:23.160]  about the location of fema camps and make you know they have a listed state by
[3:17:23.160 --> 3:17:24.360]  state
[3:17:24.360 --> 3:17:27.560]  of all these things well yeah the fema admits they have it and then people
[3:17:27.560 --> 3:17:30.600]  never will go look at it when you finally show them a camp they go
[3:17:30.600 --> 3:17:35.560]  well that's not a concentration camp it's only a whole dissenter alex this is
[3:17:35.560 --> 3:17:38.760]  perfect you're familiar with google earth i'm sure
[3:17:38.760 --> 3:17:42.440]  yes okay when you try to look them up their blackout
[3:17:42.440 --> 3:17:45.880]  pardon when you try to look them up their their grayed out
[3:17:45.880 --> 3:17:50.360]  oh no no i'm looking at one right now that will blow your mind
[3:17:50.360 --> 3:17:53.880]  i live in idaho so curious enough i'd
[3:17:53.880 --> 3:17:57.560]  look down the list and there's idaho and there's one that's listed it's called
[3:17:57.560 --> 3:18:01.400]  and uh... if anybody cares to look it up because i'm looking at it now
[3:18:01.400 --> 3:18:05.640]  uh... so i can uh... to tell about this it's called moose creek it's right by
[3:18:05.640 --> 3:18:07.560]  the montana state line
[3:18:07.560 --> 3:18:12.760]  it says this unmaned facility is reported to have a nearby airfield so i went
[3:18:12.760 --> 3:18:14.360]  to google earth
[3:18:14.360 --> 3:18:17.080]  typed in moose creek idaho
[3:18:17.080 --> 3:18:20.680]  and right now i'm looking at an elevation of sixty six hundred and seventy
[3:18:20.680 --> 3:18:23.160]  four feet and there is
[3:18:23.160 --> 3:18:26.600]  most incredible airstrip on the top
[3:18:26.600 --> 3:18:28.600]  of these mountains
[3:18:28.600 --> 3:18:34.360]  and there is a facility just north of the airstrip a bridge to the south of it
[3:18:34.360 --> 3:18:39.160]  and if people don't believe that some of these things are in remote locations
[3:18:39.160 --> 3:18:43.640]  i highly advise them to go look at this one it will blow your mind
[3:18:43.640 --> 3:18:48.440]  this thing is so remote it's incredible and you can see the bar bar fences and
[3:18:48.440 --> 3:18:52.360]  guard towers well no now that's the next part this is what really has made me
[3:18:52.360 --> 3:18:56.520]  curious i've been uh... watching in this aerial view and going from different
[3:18:56.520 --> 3:19:00.760]  directions for all probably three or four hours over the last few days
[3:19:00.760 --> 3:19:04.360]  and at the north end of the airstrip are too
[3:19:04.360 --> 3:19:07.800]  obvious uh... compound facilities
[3:19:07.800 --> 3:19:11.800]  but there's no bar bar fencer fencing or anything
[3:19:11.800 --> 3:19:16.120]  uh... of any nature of that but there's two distinct facilities you can see them
[3:19:16.120 --> 3:19:19.640]  from about twenty three hundred feet after that the resolution starts to get
[3:19:19.640 --> 3:19:21.080]  a little crummy
[3:19:21.080 --> 3:19:22.520]  uh... anyway
[3:19:22.520 --> 3:19:26.120]  my point being is this particular facility is
[3:19:26.120 --> 3:19:29.000]  easily seen
[3:19:29.000 --> 3:19:34.920]  and also it then if you google out if you if you scope out and go to an altitude
[3:19:34.920 --> 3:19:35.800]  of like
[3:19:35.800 --> 3:19:40.120]  all about airplane flying height about thirty five thousand feet or so
[3:19:40.120 --> 3:19:45.880]  this place is so remote the only way to get into it is this airstrip or by
[3:19:45.880 --> 3:19:46.920]  horseback
[3:19:46.920 --> 3:19:51.560]  or well i mean it's been in the associated press they built forest
[3:19:51.560 --> 3:19:55.000]  forced labor camps in the forest uh... of idaho
[3:19:55.000 --> 3:19:57.400]  and origan and it's been on the news there
[3:19:57.400 --> 3:20:00.520]  and it's been all over the news that they have the civilian inmate labor camp
[3:20:00.520 --> 3:20:02.520]  programs twenty four of the list
[3:20:02.520 --> 3:20:05.400]  secretly with american citizens in them since eighty six
[3:20:05.400 --> 3:20:08.360]  now declassified that they kept americans in camp secretly
[3:20:08.360 --> 3:20:11.720]  what people should do is go photograph these go videotape these
[3:20:11.720 --> 3:20:15.080]  and then do articles about them so a lot of folks are going to show in the camps
[3:20:15.080 --> 3:20:18.520]  with the guard towers but then they don't show that they went there off of
[3:20:18.520 --> 3:20:22.040]  government document then people then sell that's not a real camp
[3:20:22.040 --> 3:20:30.040]  so we need you guys to go out and research i appreciate your call here we go
[3:20:30.040 --> 3:20:40.040]  welcome to your life
[3:20:48.040 --> 3:20:50.440]  all right here's representative elijah coming
[3:20:51.160 --> 3:20:51.880]  he really
[3:20:51.880 --> 3:21:06.440]  he really reached out the representative of the treasury department kashkari
[3:21:07.880 --> 3:21:10.360]  and kashkari wouldn't answer his questions
[3:21:10.360 --> 3:21:14.360]  so i'm going to play some of that for you right now from the hearings this morning
[3:21:14.360 --> 3:21:17.560]  five trillion stolen they wanted to tell you where two trillion went the public
[3:21:17.560 --> 3:21:20.680]  sold it seven hundred billion and they're giving none of it to where they swore to
[3:21:20.680 --> 3:21:23.960]  give it to get the economy going they're keeping all of it while locking down the
[3:21:23.960 --> 3:21:28.120]  currency and the credit to destroy the economy so here it is
[3:21:33.160 --> 3:21:39.960]  the chair recognizes mr comings may proceed mr kakus carry him still listening carefully
[3:21:40.760 --> 3:21:45.800]  and i'll just let me ask you a few questions um one of the reasons why i've voted for the bailout
[3:21:45.800 --> 3:21:53.720]  about very reluctantly held my nose closed my eyes and prayed um is because president
[3:21:53.720 --> 3:22:02.120]  elect obama at that time has assured me that if he were elected president that he would
[3:22:02.120 --> 3:22:07.960]  work on making sure that the uh people that might be losing their houses due for closure
[3:22:07.960 --> 3:22:13.480]  would be helped uh if president obama came to you so i don't know how long you're gonna be around
[3:22:13.480 --> 3:22:18.680]  um so i i mean i assume somebody's gonna ask paulson or somebody this question
[3:22:19.560 --> 3:22:27.720]  but at present elect obama came to you and said give me your best advice as to how i can help
[3:22:28.920 --> 3:22:36.680]  how i can help um people who are facing foreclosure um what would you tell him
[3:22:36.680 --> 3:22:43.000]  um congressman that's a very important question that's been a lot of time thinking about
[3:22:43.560 --> 3:22:48.440]  the best thing i think we can do as a country to help the housing market and avoid foreclosures
[3:22:48.440 --> 3:22:53.960]  is to bring mortgage rates down for borrowers so they can refinance into long-term sustainable
[3:22:53.960 --> 3:22:58.920]  mortgages that they can afford and the way to do that partly what we did was stabilizing fanny
[3:22:58.920 --> 3:23:03.560]  and freddy was to stabilize mortgage finance and some of the actions we're looking at trying to get
[3:23:03.560 --> 3:23:08.840]  credit flowing again is to bring rates down for our consumers if we can bring mortgage rates down
[3:23:08.840 --> 3:23:13.000]  as you know now again just to be clear this went on for four hours in fact it's still going on
[3:23:13.000 --> 3:23:19.960]  uh they're just on to a new part of the hearing um i thought this was what from the start of the
[3:23:19.960 --> 3:23:24.120]  hearing the stuff at the start is 10 times more powerful than all of this and wait till i find
[3:23:24.120 --> 3:23:30.120]  that on the web i know listeners heard the show went and grabbed what was on later um and this
[3:23:30.120 --> 3:23:34.520]  has been important as well but tomorrow i am definitely going to have for you the start of
[3:23:34.520 --> 3:23:40.360]  the hearing c span dot org has the earlier start of the hearing but the video is not playing it's
[3:23:40.360 --> 3:23:46.920]  getting so many hits and we can't get it so but i haven't recorded here tomorrow we're going to have
[3:23:46.920 --> 3:23:51.240]  the first 30 minutes of that hearing for you and and and just the whole interchange will air it
[3:23:51.240 --> 3:23:55.160]  unedited in between the brakes you know the brakes will break it up but i'm going to play
[3:23:55.160 --> 3:23:59.960]  continuously uh so you can hear what went on and what happened i mean just to get the idea because
[3:23:59.960 --> 3:24:03.720]  i watched it for an hour this morning of how kashkari is just a complete snake this is a
[3:24:03.720 --> 3:24:09.240]  bunch of babble so let's skip ahead and see what the uh congress because the congressman really
[3:24:09.240 --> 3:24:13.240]  was powerful when he first talked to him i don't even know what this is right here no congressman
[3:24:13.240 --> 3:24:23.320]  our housing system are very volatile do skipping ahead of the congressman the you know we we have
[3:24:23.320 --> 3:24:30.120]  a very volatile um let me go back to fanny man freddy please i'd asked you before a little bit
[3:24:30.120 --> 3:24:42.040]  earlier about um how this loss this announcement on monday the 29 billion dollar loss affects if at
[3:24:42.040 --> 3:24:48.840]  all what you were trying to do to help the homeowner through fanny made i mean does it affect it
[3:24:48.840 --> 3:24:55.320]  well excuse me sir not directly we had when we took our actions in july and august to stabilize
[3:24:55.320 --> 3:25:00.760]  fanny and freddy we expected big losses to come and so we sized these hundred billion dollar
[3:25:00.760 --> 3:25:06.200]  contracts to be big enough to deal with those losses so we're not surprised by it we knew
[3:25:06.200 --> 3:25:10.440]  they were coming and we don't think that that directly affects what we can do with fanny and freddy
[3:25:12.040 --> 3:25:18.280]  now you know i was intrigued by mr isis questions and and i want to give you a broader question
[3:25:18.280 --> 3:25:26.360]  sort of hooked up with his you know you all have to make some tough decisions as to where this 700
[3:25:26.360 --> 3:25:31.800]  billion dollars is going and the american people and this is what i hear at the supermarket
[3:25:33.000 --> 3:25:38.360]  at the gas station when i run into my neighbors they think that there's a whole line of people
[3:25:38.360 --> 3:25:44.440]  who are lined up with their hands out they're looking at gm they're looking at all these other
[3:25:44.440 --> 3:25:52.040]  folks who are saying government bail us out and i want to know two things one what goes into the
[3:25:52.040 --> 3:25:59.800]  decision making with regard to you know the better i know i mean i know you guys all right i'm
[3:25:59.800 --> 3:26:02.920]  going to keep playing it during the break go ahead and get daryl run this on you got his number right
[3:26:03.720 --> 3:26:09.720]  he's all set and ready okay great here we go certain strictures you got to go go by
[3:26:09.720 --> 3:26:18.760]  and how do you all try to make sure that whatever ever the objective is it is it happens in other
[3:26:18.760 --> 3:26:23.320]  words do you need more authority from us because i gotta tell you one of the most disappointing
[3:26:23.320 --> 3:26:28.680]  things for me is when we when you all get the get gave the banks money and then i read the next day
[3:26:29.240 --> 3:26:32.680]  that a lot of the banks were not going to be loaning money and i understand what you're
[3:26:32.680 --> 3:26:37.560]  trying to do loaning money and that they were going to use the money to acquire other banks
[3:26:37.560 --> 3:26:42.520]  they were going to use the money to you know not make the cut cuts that they needed to make
[3:26:42.520 --> 3:26:48.520]  and all that kind of stuff so now we face the situation with gm and a lot of us are saying you
[3:26:48.520 --> 3:26:55.800]  know what uh one out of every every ten jobs is connected with the automobile industry we don't
[3:26:55.800 --> 3:27:02.200]  we we we want to make sure that we don't lose a gm or lose any of our automobile companies because
[3:27:02.200 --> 3:27:06.760]  they're so important to our economy but at the same time the american people are saying
[3:27:06.760 --> 3:27:11.240]  and and and we want to make sure that if they got some money that they they move towards making
[3:27:11.240 --> 3:27:17.160]  sure they're energy efficient cars and they're competitive and all that so how do you all
[3:27:18.040 --> 3:27:22.520]  you know say okay we're gonna give like mr isaac was saying you're gonna give to this company
[3:27:22.520 --> 3:27:28.360]  gonna give this bank how you're gonna do that and and so what is the objective and how do you make
[3:27:28.360 --> 3:27:35.480]  sure the the objective is is achieved in other words you can't guarantee but create the best
[3:27:35.480 --> 3:27:42.120]  possible circumstance to have it achieved and do you need more authority from us to achieve that
[3:27:42.120 --> 3:27:46.920]  because i'm gonna tell you the american people are running out of patience and you know my friends
[3:27:46.920 --> 3:27:52.440]  mr isaac and mystic percentage voted against the legislation i'm gonna tell you i've ventured
[3:27:52.440 --> 3:27:57.560]  against most of us wanted to vote against even the ones that voted for it so i'm trying to figure
[3:27:57.560 --> 3:28:04.840]  out how do you tell me how do you do that you follow me because at some point the congress
[3:28:04.840 --> 3:28:11.720]  is going to say sorry no more because you know what the american people are saying it already
[3:28:13.560 --> 3:28:16.840]  so congressman these are very good questions and let's talk through them i i appreciate
[3:28:16.840 --> 3:28:21.480]  you're asking them first of all if you look at the capital program no let's not hear from you
[3:28:22.040 --> 3:28:26.920]  um now you see that congressman not getting it that bill said they could rob and steal all the
[3:28:26.920 --> 3:28:34.200]  money the bill already said that in it okay and and the bankers are the ones that engineered
[3:28:34.200 --> 3:28:37.480]  all of this they don't care about anybody congressman cutting him
[3:28:41.560 --> 3:28:47.320]  they don't care what the american people want it's about control they want an imploding economy so
[3:28:47.320 --> 3:28:53.240]  they can control the population and he says do you need more authority they already have unlimited
[3:28:53.240 --> 3:28:59.160]  criminal fiat authority they they set all this up they're going to tell the public we need more
[3:28:59.160 --> 3:29:03.720]  authority world government authority run by the bankers to fix all of this
[3:29:05.880 --> 3:29:12.360]  nine four nine three five seven zero john you got both ISD in lines connected i'm not getting audio
[3:29:12.360 --> 3:29:17.720]  on on the main comrades okay i can uh go ahead and switch over to you you're not you're not
[3:29:17.720 --> 3:29:33.640]  sending me audio on it that's why so go ahead and send me audio on it okay here here we go
[3:29:33.640 --> 3:29:49.000]  all right folks we are back live only go right to daryl run this
[3:29:50.520 --> 3:29:54.280]  daryl's had a long interesting life i've done a lot of things i don't know how much he wants to
[3:29:54.280 --> 3:29:59.640]  get into himself on air but i'll let him introduce himself and he has some ideas a lot of love ideas
[3:29:59.640 --> 3:30:04.200]  and things we need to do but he's also contributed to what we do here financially we appreciate him
[3:30:05.480 --> 3:30:09.080]  but you know he's he's thought of ideas to try to create an info wars boot camp
[3:30:10.280 --> 3:30:14.840]  that we do every three or four months uh have folks come in from all over the country go through
[3:30:14.840 --> 3:30:19.880]  basic training i thought i'd go out and and and fight the new world order basic ideas
[3:30:21.000 --> 3:30:26.520]  maybe press passes or something uh because he set up an organization that is trained
[3:30:26.520 --> 3:30:32.520]  i don't know hundreds of thousands of christians to go out and win souls effectively and he's
[3:30:32.520 --> 3:30:37.240]  really convinced me you know he's a salesman in his own right and has uh one of the largest uh
[3:30:37.240 --> 3:30:41.320]  you know companies out there with direct marketing he's the guy that started the stuff in the grocery
[3:30:41.320 --> 3:30:47.240]  store where you see the uh you walk in the people are there with the shirt and tie and they're
[3:30:47.240 --> 3:30:52.600]  uh you know saying hey uh you know get a t-shirt when you sign up for uh the austin america statesman
[3:30:52.600 --> 3:30:58.920]  of the dallas morning news the la times whatever and you know so he's got some good ideas uh i'm
[3:30:58.920 --> 3:31:03.880]  just busy trying to you know grow my organization up so i can do things like that uh right now
[3:31:03.880 --> 3:31:09.000]  we're so busy with the task at hand that i end up uh you know never getting around to that but he
[3:31:09.000 --> 3:31:13.080]  but he wanted to uh he wanted me to talk about it on air or brainstorm about it so i thought i'd get
[3:31:13.080 --> 3:31:17.960]  him up about it but but but also just about the nature of the new world order and his awakening
[3:31:17.960 --> 3:31:23.080]  and and and daryl saying that christians need to stop being phony christians and not fighting tyranny
[3:31:23.080 --> 3:31:27.720]  uh and and then just saying god's gonna handle it all when god tells us to go out and take action
[3:31:27.720 --> 3:31:34.120]  against evil and i always butcher his story uh his parable of the eyes being the wind of the soul
[3:31:34.120 --> 3:31:39.480]  so maybe he'll also uh you know tell that um in its proper form of the way he told it to me
[3:31:39.480 --> 3:31:44.440]  daryl it's good to have you uh hear with us on the air oh hey alex it's my privilege and honor
[3:31:44.440 --> 3:31:49.800]  man i uh thank god for you and i know i speak for millions of people out there who never get the
[3:31:49.800 --> 3:31:54.760]  opportunity to tell you you know face to face or call the call that uh man we truly do thank god
[3:31:54.760 --> 3:32:00.040]  for you and what you're doing we know it's not easy and uh man you you'd like your previous caller had
[3:32:00.040 --> 3:32:05.800]  you had online there um said i'm sure you don't leave it at the office i'm sure uh your life
[3:32:05.800 --> 3:32:11.240]  has to uh be a big part of it too so we thank god for her and the sacrifices she makes to uh
[3:32:11.240 --> 3:32:16.200]  make what you do possible man i you woke me up a few years ago so i'm i'm honored to be on your
[3:32:16.200 --> 3:32:20.680]  show now but i gotta tell you you've also inspired me to start a whole new business you're supposed
[3:32:20.680 --> 3:32:28.680]  to say what business is that uh what business is that daryl i'm glad you asked alex hey i'm gonna go
[3:32:28.680 --> 3:32:33.960]  into the demolition business man since it was so easy for those buildings on 9 11 to come down
[3:32:33.960 --> 3:32:39.080]  in freefall speed just due to fires i decided i'm gonna start my own demolition company instead
[3:32:39.080 --> 3:32:43.400]  of using explosives i'll save millions i'll just knock a couple holes in the side of building
[3:32:43.400 --> 3:32:47.800]  lighting on fire and man within an hour the building will come down and i'll make millions
[3:32:48.840 --> 3:32:53.720]  no that's a great system i think we ought to do that um well we're so good on 9 11 right that's
[3:32:53.720 --> 3:32:57.480]  what the government would have us believe so we know we might as well just go in the demolition
[3:32:57.480 --> 3:33:01.000]  business together we'll just go get a couple wrecking balls and knock a couple holes in the
[3:33:01.000 --> 3:33:04.920]  side of the building poor bunch here seen inside set it on fire kickback roast marshmallows and
[3:33:04.920 --> 3:33:10.680]  make our money i know it's it's uh revolutionizing the demolition business all you need is a big
[3:33:10.680 --> 3:33:17.080]  lighter and uh knock out a few windows and it magically happens now now daryl before we run out of
[3:33:17.080 --> 3:33:23.960]  time we were having dinner one time down here in austin you you're up in dallas um there in um
[3:33:23.960 --> 3:33:29.160]  back and forth from dallas to aliyah with your businesses but you were uh you know giving me
[3:33:29.160 --> 3:33:37.000]  the parable of we were talking about people that sell out to the new world order and uh you
[3:33:37.000 --> 3:33:43.000]  gave the analogy of somebody selling their eyes well let me yeah let me explain that in fact
[3:33:43.000 --> 3:33:46.360]  let me kind of take it a step back just one second because i know we are there's so much to
[3:33:46.360 --> 3:33:51.720]  talk about a little time you know i believe like the colonel believed and spoke of yesterday this
[3:33:51.720 --> 3:33:56.040]  isn't just a battle of flesh and blood against the new world order it's also a battle for soul
[3:33:56.040 --> 3:34:00.600]  so i became a christian about six years ago not by choice but because of the evidence you know
[3:34:00.600 --> 3:34:05.720]  that supported the bible and you know prophecy history archaeology and now when you wake up to
[3:34:05.720 --> 3:34:10.120]  that and you realize there is a god he has a son he is our savior he died on the cross for our sins
[3:34:10.120 --> 3:34:15.320]  and so on you come to realize what uh jesus said in the most popular speech of all time in the
[3:34:15.320 --> 3:34:19.960]  sermon on the mountain that if you're not the one who can kill the body and after that do no more
[3:34:19.960 --> 3:34:24.120]  you're the one who can not only kill the body but after that have your whole folk cast into hell
[3:34:24.120 --> 3:34:29.240]  so we know that all the puppets all the elite all those people in power that are really uh
[3:34:29.240 --> 3:34:34.840]  perpetuating this on the people their headmaster is satan there was a guy named lester crowley
[3:34:34.840 --> 3:34:39.400]  years and years and years ago who wrote the book of the law and it's a book still used by
[3:34:39.400 --> 3:34:44.360]  satanic worshipers today for their rituals and their rights and it's it's only one law
[3:34:44.360 --> 3:34:48.040]  let us do what thou will do whatever you want to do do it your way have it your way
[3:34:48.600 --> 3:34:52.120]  and american people have really fed into that i mean we're the biggest consumers on this planet
[3:34:52.120 --> 3:34:57.560]  and we we buy into that covetous nature and and so really what satan wants is your soul
[3:34:57.560 --> 3:35:00.920]  this isn't a battle to see who's going to win or lose in the end we know there is a god you're
[3:35:00.920 --> 3:35:04.200]  going to have to give an account on that day without the right to sniff the Christ you'll
[3:35:04.200 --> 3:35:08.920]  perish so in order to help people understand the value of what we're dealing with here
[3:35:08.920 --> 3:35:13.240]  and if you truly even if you're not a christian even if you're an atheist i i've never met an
[3:35:13.240 --> 3:35:17.640]  unreasonable person who doesn't at least believe in the golden rule that you ought to treat others
[3:35:17.640 --> 3:35:23.000]  the way you'd want to be treated and the government is lying people up to be ready i'm an i'm no
[3:35:23.000 --> 3:35:28.440]  profit but i'm gonna tell you exactly how it's going to go down when they collapse this financial
[3:35:28.440 --> 3:35:32.360]  you know whole market what they're going to do is they're saying hey alex we know you know you had
[3:35:32.360 --> 3:35:36.120]  a hundred thousand dollars in the bank and we're sorry that uh we can't give you your money but i
[3:35:36.120 --> 3:35:40.360]  tell you what we're going to this global system it's a new global world it's a new world order
[3:35:40.360 --> 3:35:46.360]  it's a global economy in order to get your hundred thousand global credit you need to take
[3:35:46.360 --> 3:35:51.080]  this chip so that you can get plugged into the system and at that point time it's going to be
[3:35:51.080 --> 3:35:55.320]  hey you can take the chip and get your money and get your goods and be part of the system or
[3:35:55.320 --> 3:36:00.040]  you can and and and basically take the market of the east and end up going to hell so i mean
[3:36:00.040 --> 3:36:04.200]  really that's what we're faced with and the fact of the matter is i'd have to meet a same person
[3:36:04.200 --> 3:36:08.360]  who would trade their eyes for a million bucks ten million a hundred million dollars to ask people
[3:36:08.360 --> 3:36:13.480]  all the time in fact i'll challenge anybody that's in their right mind to call in and say hey
[3:36:13.480 --> 3:36:17.960]  i'll take the arrow up on the offer a million bucks i'll trade my both my eyes they'll go down
[3:36:17.960 --> 3:36:21.320]  we'll have surgery they'll take their eyes out they'll be having a million dollars but they'll
[3:36:21.320 --> 3:36:26.920]  be bought nobody would do that why your eyes are valuable they're precious right they're irreplaceable
[3:36:27.560 --> 3:36:32.520]  but if they're near me the windows for your soul to look out of how much more is the full work
[3:36:33.080 --> 3:36:37.240]  so you can't put a price tag on somebody's phone that's really what woke me up and i guess you
[3:36:37.240 --> 3:36:43.000]  could call today my friend out party alex because like you and many others when you first wake up
[3:36:43.000 --> 3:36:47.800]  you go well i get it i need to do something what can i do about it and we all know there's a new
[3:36:47.800 --> 3:36:52.440]  world or we know about the illuminati we know about our corrupt politicians other puppets you know
[3:36:52.440 --> 3:36:56.680]  the question is what are we going to do about it i'm not about problems i didn't succeed in business
[3:36:56.680 --> 3:37:01.000]  because i focused on the problem i focused on solutions and that's why i approached you because
[3:37:01.000 --> 3:37:06.840]  i thought well we need to do something to help equip these people if you push a soldier into
[3:37:06.840 --> 3:37:11.080]  battle armed with a feather duster they're not going to be very courageous but if you arm them
[3:37:11.080 --> 3:37:14.920]  with state-of-the-art weapons and you give them great training on how to use those weapons
[3:37:14.920 --> 3:37:20.680]  not figure you know i'm talking figuratively not literally then they can battle and and do it
[3:37:20.680 --> 3:37:25.800]  courageously but uh man this isn't just a battle for souls you know i wouldn't in fact when i
[3:37:25.800 --> 3:37:30.680]  witnessed alex i don't just walk up there and say hey you know jesus loves you jesus didn't do that
[3:37:30.680 --> 3:37:35.000]  you start in the natural and then you work to the spiritual and one great springboard
[3:37:35.000 --> 3:37:38.760]  is what's going on in the world economy today what's going on with our government today i mean
[3:37:38.760 --> 3:37:42.760]  one great segue question you can always ask them somebody is hey are you happy
[3:37:42.760 --> 3:37:48.200]  with the way the government you know serving you today and of course what nine out of ten
[3:37:48.200 --> 3:37:51.880]  are going to say no man they suck they're horrible they're terrible and say yeah well do you know why
[3:37:51.880 --> 3:37:56.120]  and you can open up that door conversation then absolutely because you know talking i mean even
[3:37:56.120 --> 3:37:59.720]  the way i approach people on the street you know the way nine eleven truthers do we are changed
[3:37:59.720 --> 3:38:06.280]  not all of them but some you know uh we approach it a lot of times yelling screaming aggressively
[3:38:06.280 --> 3:38:11.240]  you know all the i don't want to call them tricks just systems to really get people to
[3:38:11.240 --> 3:38:15.320]  stop and think and i've seen you i mean you really are a you know top-light salesman that's why
[3:38:15.320 --> 3:38:19.480]  you know you're you're so successful and have a you know a hundred million dollar company uh or
[3:38:19.480 --> 3:38:24.760]  more i mean explain to people some of the little tactics you use versus what people that aren't
[3:38:24.760 --> 3:38:30.440]  thinking about how to wake people up uh i mean compare those to it all starts with alex as we
[3:38:30.440 --> 3:38:35.960]  talked about our motive when we witness okay or when you go to just wake people up about the truth
[3:38:35.960 --> 3:38:41.560]  of the new world order to never be anymore or any less than love it always has to be found in love
[3:38:41.560 --> 3:38:46.280]  why because if you do it just to win an argument or because you think they ought to know or whatever
[3:38:46.280 --> 3:38:51.720]  your job isn't to wake them up your job is to give them good strong factual information and to do it
[3:38:51.720 --> 3:38:56.280]  with love and gentleness and respect and patience and if you do that then it's up to them you give
[3:38:56.280 --> 3:39:01.560]  them the information it's up to them if they receive it that's why you know i speak out today
[3:39:01.560 --> 3:39:06.840]  to all the christians who call themselves christians because every true blue bible even christian
[3:39:06.840 --> 3:39:11.240]  that i know that i've talked to and i've traveled the world and i work with major ministry uh many
[3:39:11.240 --> 3:39:15.720]  of which you know and see on tv and i tell you the truth they all sense in their spirit that
[3:39:15.720 --> 3:39:19.880]  we're living in the last day which means that there's an imminent return of christ that's going
[3:39:19.880 --> 3:39:25.320]  to happen okay and yet when you talk to them about how the stage is being set how biblical
[3:39:25.320 --> 3:39:29.640]  processes are being unfulfilled right well let me say this yeah yeah i think they think
[3:39:29.640 --> 3:39:34.440]  they think oh that alex jones he's that guy that that creaking from you know planet pop part you
[3:39:34.440 --> 3:39:38.920]  know yeah they don't they don't connect and it's a shame because if they truly believe what the
[3:39:38.920 --> 3:39:45.240]  bible says then and that this is a battle for souls there is a satan he he is the ruler of this world
[3:39:45.240 --> 3:39:51.160]  then they ought to at least if they loved anybody family friends strangers even if they love people
[3:39:51.160 --> 3:39:55.960]  the way jesus loved people he'd be warned they'd be one of them they'd be talking to him so love
[3:39:55.960 --> 3:40:00.600]  is our motive why because perfect love cast out all fear i know from my own personal experience
[3:40:00.600 --> 3:40:04.680]  i'm always afraid and why i was reluctant to come on your show initially and so on
[3:40:05.240 --> 3:40:10.360]  is what will people think what will people say what will people do what will i say you know i don't
[3:40:10.360 --> 3:40:14.280]  know what to say or it's just too difficult they'll think i flipped out well let me just back up for
[3:40:14.280 --> 3:40:17.560]  a minute and i mean interrupt you in the time we have barrel we'll have you back up because i asked
[3:40:17.560 --> 3:40:21.000]  you to come on months ago i said you ought to do a radio show as everybody else has told you
[3:40:21.000 --> 3:40:25.000]  but you haven't done it but you should do one i know you're a very busy guy because you're extremely
[3:40:25.000 --> 3:40:28.920]  articulate and really make your points well speaking of bible prophecy i don't mean the phony
[3:40:28.920 --> 3:40:33.960]  churches folks and you know all the stuff we see in the you know ridiculous tell a marketer saying
[3:40:33.960 --> 3:40:38.040]  give me a thousand gotta give you ten sure sure sure sure what we're talking about is
[3:40:38.920 --> 3:40:44.600]  why did the why did the world government why is the un setting up ten kingdoms they call it
[3:40:44.600 --> 3:40:50.120]  ten kingdoms why do they use terminology that's all about lucifer and world government why are
[3:40:50.120 --> 3:40:56.600]  they pushing that we take chips why are they setting up that exact system go ahead well exactly
[3:40:56.600 --> 3:41:00.600]  because just like a lecture Crowley taught keep in mind this wasn't a guy who didn't believe in god
[3:41:00.600 --> 3:41:05.240]  he wasn't an atheist he was called the evilest man of his day he was a pedophile he's wicked
[3:41:05.240 --> 3:41:09.640]  he's responsible for the biggest rebellion and devil worship kind of music and stuff that we've
[3:41:09.640 --> 3:41:15.080]  seen in our in our modern day generation okay he said hey i don't have a problem with the
[3:41:15.080 --> 3:41:19.560]  plummet brethren referring to christians he said i can't imagine the society who didn't believe in
[3:41:19.560 --> 3:41:25.480]  god or jesus i just chose to serve the other side he wasn't content just to serve satan
[3:41:25.480 --> 3:41:29.960]  he said he wanted to be his chief but staff and that's where these guys are what satan holds the
[3:41:29.960 --> 3:41:35.080]  keys to earth and the power and the wealth and you know because god's not into material stuff
[3:41:35.080 --> 3:41:41.000]  okay he's into these any like religion he likes relationship so the bottom line is these guys do
[3:41:41.000 --> 3:41:45.400]  this i mean that's just one in many processes i mean go to daniel 12 where daniel said in the
[3:41:45.400 --> 3:41:49.960]  last days knowledge will be increased greatly i mean think about it how fast could we travel
[3:41:49.960 --> 3:41:55.960]  back in jesus's day by horse in george washington's day a couple thousand years later by horse no
[3:41:55.960 --> 3:42:01.160]  improvement technology but in our lifetime we've seen the internet we've seen radio we've seen
[3:42:01.160 --> 3:42:06.200]  car assembly spacious satellite you name it now there's there's thousands of biblical prophecy
[3:42:06.200 --> 3:42:11.320]  to be better being unfolded right before i said people will run to and fro continually
[3:42:11.320 --> 3:42:16.520]  look at the highways and roads just and and in particular as far as you know i wanted to
[3:42:16.520 --> 3:42:21.320]  bring this up today through important false flag terrorism well there's a biblical precedent for
[3:42:21.320 --> 3:42:27.160]  that and christians ought to wake up to that reality that 911 is and could be an inside job
[3:42:27.160 --> 3:42:33.000]  very likely isn't an inside job why nero did the same thing to the christian he said his own
[3:42:33.000 --> 3:42:36.840]  you know city on fire and then he fiddled all night and what did he do he blamed the christian
[3:42:36.840 --> 3:42:42.040]  so christians ought to be in particularly aware of what's going on how likely it is
[3:42:42.040 --> 3:42:47.400]  for a uh a government to do a self-inflicted wound in order to avoid another party in fact and i
[3:42:47.400 --> 3:42:50.520]  wanted to bring this up because nobody brought this up on your show and i thought it was very
[3:42:50.520 --> 3:42:55.960]  intriguing went over all most that i've met american pet in the very first debate between
[3:42:55.960 --> 3:43:01.000]  obama and mccain they asked mccain i think it was the second question the moderator asked
[3:43:01.000 --> 3:43:06.760]  are we safer today than we were a day after 911 he gave a very precarious answer go look it up on
[3:43:06.760 --> 3:43:12.840]  youtube it's there he says and i quote joe Lieberman and i started the 911 commission
[3:43:12.840 --> 3:43:18.360]  and we were stymied and stifled by the administration and it wasn't until the families came forward
[3:43:18.360 --> 3:43:25.320]  that an investigation took place now i quote now that begs the question why why would i mean this
[3:43:25.320 --> 3:43:29.560]  isn't some conspiracy theory not this isn't alex jones this isn't somebody who doesn't know what
[3:43:29.560 --> 3:43:32.760]  they're talking about this is potentially at that time the next president of the united states
[3:43:32.760 --> 3:43:39.320]  acknowledging that the bush administration did not want to investigate 911 why why wouldn't you
[3:43:39.320 --> 3:43:43.480]  investigate the biggest most horrific terrorist attack in the history of the war there's got to
[3:43:43.480 --> 3:43:47.800]  be a reason that they would uncover something of course they would why would they fight why would
[3:43:47.800 --> 3:43:53.800]  they fight to cover everything up why would they be so secreted with the steel why would they take
[3:43:53.800 --> 3:43:58.760]  the three black boxes they did find of the four that were in the planes and at the towers
[3:43:58.760 --> 3:44:03.480]  and and and firefighters found them and they took them you guys have been talking about that for
[3:44:03.480 --> 3:44:07.640]  years now you predicted it you said it was going to happen and a lot of people don't believe it
[3:44:07.640 --> 3:44:12.040]  they don't buy they think it's a lie they rather believe the official story that the government
[3:44:12.040 --> 3:44:17.160]  feeds them and then buy that propaganda but frankly what they you know what i wanted to
[3:44:17.160 --> 3:44:20.520]  read something to you today and i don't know if we have time go ahead we're just incurred
[3:44:20.520 --> 3:44:25.480]  the listeners to go there's a little bit of profiting from prophecy and some words of encouragement
[3:44:25.480 --> 3:44:30.680]  for you in particular alexa because we know you're the point of spear of this whole movement so
[3:44:30.680 --> 3:44:35.160]  but listen to this this is second Timothy chapter three and four it says mark this there'll be
[3:44:35.160 --> 3:44:40.440]  terrible times in the last days people now see if this sounds like our generation okay people will
[3:44:40.440 --> 3:44:46.440]  be lovers of themselves lovers of money boastful proud abusive disobedient to their parents
[3:44:46.440 --> 3:44:52.280]  ungrateful unholy without love unforgiving slanderous man you deal with that every day on
[3:44:52.280 --> 3:44:57.560]  your show without self-control brutal look at think about the brutality of the crimes we see
[3:44:57.560 --> 3:45:02.120]  against children today not lovers of the good see people today don't even care about good all they
[3:45:02.120 --> 3:45:05.960]  care about is moving up right i don't care who's back they got a stab to move up the corporate
[3:45:05.960 --> 3:45:11.080]  ladder they do it all the time they're treacherous rash conceited lovers of pleasure rather than
[3:45:11.080 --> 3:45:15.720]  lovers of god they have a form of godliness but they deny his power it says have nothing to do
[3:45:15.720 --> 3:45:19.720]  with them there's a kind who warmed their way into homes and gained control over weak little
[3:45:19.720 --> 3:45:24.120]  women who are loaded down with all kinds of sins swayed by all kinds of evil to the desires
[3:45:25.080 --> 3:45:28.520]  also learning but now this is an interesting it fits our generation as well
[3:45:29.240 --> 3:45:34.280]  also forever learning but unable to acknowledge the truth we live in the information age before
[3:45:34.280 --> 3:45:39.240]  learning faster than they have all the info to prove it to them but they don't they still deny it
[3:45:39.240 --> 3:45:44.600]  as every newspaper announces world government's born oven by the banks and they say nope doesn't
[3:45:44.600 --> 3:45:50.920]  exist well and that's what's interesting listen to this this is starting chapter four this is
[3:45:50.920 --> 3:45:55.560]  keep in mind this is apopo paul's last book of the bible that he wrote that he's in prison he's
[3:45:55.560 --> 3:46:00.440]  waiting to be executed he's writing this to his disciple timothy last he's kind of like his last
[3:46:00.440 --> 3:46:05.320]  will and testament he says in the presence of god in the view of jesus christ who will judge the
[3:46:05.320 --> 3:46:10.120]  living and the dead and and in the view of his appearing in his kingdom i give you this charge
[3:46:10.120 --> 3:46:16.840]  preach the word be prepared in season and out of season correct review and encourage with great
[3:46:16.840 --> 3:46:22.040]  patience and careful instruction for the time will come when men will not put up with down doctrine
[3:46:22.040 --> 3:46:27.160]  or truth instead to suit their own desires they'll gather around them a great number of teachers
[3:46:27.160 --> 3:46:32.600]  to say what their itching ears want to hear they'll turn they'll turn aside to miss and fairy tale
[3:46:32.600 --> 3:46:38.040]  but you keep your head in all situations endure hardship and do the work of an evangelist
[3:46:38.040 --> 3:46:41.720]  discharge of the full duties of your ministry in other words but there's nothing more important
[3:46:41.720 --> 3:46:46.760]  any of us can do who are believers then to use this information to wake people up so it leads
[3:46:46.760 --> 3:46:50.840]  into the knowledge of the truth that their soul may be saying i mean that's the bottom line if you
[3:46:50.840 --> 3:46:54.920]  love somebody you care about somebody i'm walking down the street and i see a stranger's house on
[3:46:54.920 --> 3:46:59.320]  fire i don't even know the guy and i have the opportunity to go in there and get him out i'm
[3:46:59.320 --> 3:47:05.720]  under a moral obligation to do that there you are final segment straight ahead but for the info
[3:47:05.720 --> 3:47:10.040]  awards and present planet on tv listeners and viewers we're going to talk right now it is a big
[3:47:10.760 --> 3:47:17.080]  daryl yeah so so the bottom line is simply this look if we love people we're going to we're going
[3:47:17.080 --> 3:47:23.320]  to pursue with all passion uh you know waking these people up talking to them sharing with them
[3:47:23.320 --> 3:47:29.000]  caring enough to to share this information you don't get rejected don't get sad when they reject
[3:47:29.000 --> 3:47:33.880]  you okay because the power's not in the in the messenger it's in the message what you got to
[3:47:33.880 --> 3:47:39.320]  do is be a faithful farmer just sow those seeds of information to people and then people respond
[3:47:39.320 --> 3:47:43.000]  or they don't and when we come back from the break i definitely want to share what to answer your
[3:47:43.000 --> 3:47:49.160]  question alex for simple steps to help anybody effectively communicate their message all right
[3:47:49.160 --> 3:47:55.320]  we'll do that but you know speaking to uh folks that um you know that love the lie they do it
[3:47:55.320 --> 3:48:00.200]  because they're scared at the end of the day and and well i think the key i mean i think the key is
[3:48:00.200 --> 3:48:05.240]  to explain to them they should be more concerned about not while they're alive this one time doing
[3:48:05.240 --> 3:48:11.320]  the right thing and and and and helping others and that they're unhappy because they love worldliness
[3:48:11.320 --> 3:48:16.760]  not that i'm perfect here folks but and that they love the system and so of course they're not
[3:48:16.760 --> 3:48:22.280]  fulfilled but as soon as they start loving good uh that then they'll start growing in the opposite
[3:48:22.280 --> 3:48:29.720]  direction away from evil towards good and it'll get stronger and stronger um but go ahead well i
[3:48:29.720 --> 3:48:34.840]  think really before anybody can have power over the sin that we've all been infected with i mean
[3:48:34.840 --> 3:48:38.920]  think about it the old devil on one shoulder the angel on the other right we want to do what's good
[3:48:38.920 --> 3:48:43.080]  god gave us conscience we know what's right from wrong yet sometimes we get tempted and we do what
[3:48:43.080 --> 3:48:48.600]  we know we ought not to do so no one sins without knowledge in fact the word conscience con means
[3:48:48.600 --> 3:48:52.760]  with science means knowledge so with knowledge every time you do something you shouldn't you
[3:48:52.760 --> 3:48:56.760]  do it with knowledge so i don't think anybody really has the power to turn from that nature
[3:48:56.760 --> 3:49:01.800]  that sin nature and tell christ comes in changes their heart because when god changes the person's
[3:49:01.800 --> 3:49:06.520]  heart and that to me is the greatest testimony of all that that god is real and jesus is the
[3:49:06.520 --> 3:49:11.240]  son of god because only he has the power to face the one soul and change a person's heart
[3:49:11.240 --> 3:49:16.120]  absolutely you know i wanted to do a heart daryl i wanted to talk some about you know on air
[3:49:17.080 --> 3:49:22.440]  you've got a great idea i need to do it people have asked me to do it um i just about almost
[3:49:22.440 --> 3:49:29.160]  afraid of leading organizations because i i i don't like particularly being a leader a
[3:49:30.040 --> 3:49:33.800]  uh... i mean a teacher well well well well well i mean also i liked well let me just to finish up

[3:51:09.080 --> 3:51:15.080]  we need to form more like a school or whatever and then but so we don't have a liability then
[3:51:15.080 --> 3:51:19.880]  after they leave they're not our creatures it's like okay you've got this idea now go do what you
[3:51:19.880 --> 3:51:24.120]  want uh you know to try to teach people how to really fight the new world order we got about
[3:51:24.120 --> 3:51:29.400]  three minutes left tell folks uh you know kind of those steps you've learned okay basically
[3:51:30.360 --> 3:51:33.800]  what i'd like to do alex and what we're talking about just to fill in the gaps for the listeners
[3:51:33.800 --> 3:51:39.160]  is to do an onsite training i have roll up your sleeves get in the trenches big con battle
[3:51:39.160 --> 3:51:42.600]  you know to put against the new world order you know get fifty sixty hundred people take
[3:51:42.600 --> 3:51:46.840]  them on our wing show them what's up and those who qualify send them home let them become what
[3:51:46.840 --> 3:51:52.280]  we call a local leader we can form an organization fact already incorporated the truth news network
[3:51:52.280 --> 3:51:56.600]  so that they can all then continue to duplicate themselves i mean there that's what we have
[3:51:56.600 --> 3:52:00.520]  to do you can't do everything i can't do everything individually we're nothing but the
[3:52:00.520 --> 3:52:06.040]  but the sum of the total parts are always greater than the individual part so we know the sum
[3:52:06.040 --> 3:52:10.040]  total is always greater and we need to facilitate that that's what i'm saying we just need to give
[3:52:10.040 --> 3:52:13.880]  people the tools they need to succeed and keep them and train them so that they'll be empowered to
[3:52:13.880 --> 3:52:20.520]  face their fears and fight back against the new world order well it's a great idea and other
[3:52:20.520 --> 3:52:25.640]  folks have thought of simpler uh i mean other simple things that work that are along similar
[3:52:25.640 --> 3:52:32.040]  lines and uh darryl you've got a lot of great ideas and a lot of effective tactics to really
[3:52:32.040 --> 3:52:37.560]  reach out and really affect change uh with people out there so uh you know soon enough i guess we
[3:52:37.560 --> 3:52:41.640]  need to start planning and you know moving forward with trying to do this i'm just trying to do a
[3:52:41.640 --> 3:52:48.040]  rock obama video a jfk film a eugenics film i'm trying to finish my little tv studio my radio
[3:52:48.040 --> 3:52:52.200]  studio is going to be a lot better with a bunch of cameras and robotic cameras and well hey alex i
[3:52:52.200 --> 3:52:56.840]  know you got your hands full and your job is to disseminate the information okay what i'm proposing
[3:52:56.840 --> 3:53:01.000]  is i'll be your turn key solution to training these people look i trained thousands of people to be
[3:53:01.000 --> 3:53:05.320]  successful in business and ministry i want to provide those services free of charge to you
[3:53:05.320 --> 3:53:10.120]  okay so we'll work that out but i'd love to bring people down to austin or dallas like you're going
