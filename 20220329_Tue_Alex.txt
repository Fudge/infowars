[00:00.000 --> 00:24.440]  I know you're going to ask a really nice question.
[00:24.440 --> 00:29.440]  Well, it's an important question I think. Are you worried that other leaders in the
[00:29.440 --> 00:35.720]  world are going to start to doubt that America is back if some of these big things that you
[00:35.720 --> 00:38.560]  say on the world stage keep getting walked back?
[00:38.560 --> 00:40.720]  What's getting walked back?
[00:40.720 --> 00:45.400]  It made it sound like, just in the last couple of days, it sounded like you told US troops
[00:45.400 --> 00:49.720]  they were going to Ukraine. It sounded like you said it was possible the US would use
[00:49.720 --> 00:55.720]  a chemical weapon and it sounded like you were calling for regime change in Russia and
[00:55.720 --> 00:58.840]  we know none of the three occurred.
[00:58.840 --> 00:59.840]  None of the three occurred?
[00:59.840 --> 01:00.840]  None of the three.
[01:00.840 --> 01:01.840]  Mr. President?
[01:01.840 --> 01:05.560]  You interpret the language that way. I was talking to the troops. We were talking about
[01:05.560 --> 01:12.200]  helping train the troops in that are the Ukrainian troops that are in Poland. That's
[01:12.200 --> 01:16.240]  with the context. I sat there with those guys for a couple hours. That's what we talked
[01:16.240 --> 01:17.240]  about.
[01:17.240 --> 01:21.320]  So when you said you're going to see when you're there, you were not intending to see
[01:21.320 --> 01:22.320]  it?
[01:22.320 --> 01:27.440]  I was referring to beating with and talking with the Ukrainian troops that were in Poland.
[01:27.440 --> 01:32.400]  And when you said a chemical weapon used by Russia would trigger a response in kind?
[01:32.400 --> 01:34.840]  It will trigger a significant response.
[01:34.840 --> 01:35.840]  What does that mean?
[01:35.840 --> 01:40.880]  I'm not going to tell you. Why would I tell you that you've got to be silly?
[01:40.880 --> 01:41.880]  The world wants to know?
[01:41.880 --> 01:44.880]  The world wants to know a lot of things. I'm not telling them what the response would
[01:44.880 --> 01:47.840]  be. Then Russia knows the response.
[01:47.840 --> 01:54.120]  The bottom line on nuclear weapons is that when the president gives the order, it must
[01:54.120 --> 02:01.160]  be followed. There's about four minutes between the order being given and the people responsible
[02:01.160 --> 02:03.640]  for launching nuclear weapons to do so.
[02:03.640 --> 02:10.000]  As president, I will make it clear that the United States will treat cyber attacks just
[02:10.000 --> 02:17.440]  like any other attack. We will be ready with serious political, economic and military responses.
[02:17.440 --> 02:22.080]  They're voting for peace on planet Earth if they vote for Trump, but if they vote for
[02:22.080 --> 02:23.760]  Hillary, it's war.
[02:23.760 --> 02:28.840]  We came, we saw, we died.
[02:28.840 --> 02:31.000]  With her, you'll end up in World War 3.
[02:31.000 --> 02:34.880]  I want the Iranians to know that if I'm the president, we will attack Iran.
[02:34.880 --> 02:40.040]  Right now, Senator, for us to control all of the airspace in Syria would require us to
[02:40.040 --> 02:44.600]  go to war against Syria and Russia.
[02:44.600 --> 02:50.280]  The U.S. military has just raised the threat level to DEF CON 2. Meanwhile, Hillary Clinton
[02:50.280 --> 02:55.960]  is still threatening Russia with military action following unconfirmed reports of further
[02:55.960 --> 02:59.440]  hacking. It's like she's not even concerned about the repercussions.
[02:59.440 --> 03:01.440]  Of course not, because she's...
[03:01.440 --> 03:08.440]  All right, it looks like we're having a little bit of technical difficulties. We'll try to
[03:08.440 --> 03:14.440]  get Leanne back on in a few minutes.
[03:14.440 --> 03:39.440]  When the president gives the order, it must be followed.
[03:39.440 --> 03:44.600]  Bill of Rights is a stumbling block on the way to shutting down speech that the left
[03:44.600 --> 03:49.120]  doesn't like, at least in government. But there's a new avenue for those who would like
[03:49.120 --> 03:55.240]  to censor what you say and think, and that's corporations. The left have wised up to this.
[03:55.240 --> 04:00.920]  If you want to stop someone from telling the truth, use companies to do it. The social
[04:00.920 --> 04:02.800]  media giants, and they are.
[04:02.800 --> 04:07.600]  For many on the left, the view seems to have become that if you can't beat them, prevents
[04:07.600 --> 04:08.600]  them from speaking.
[04:08.600 --> 04:12.040]  The far most prominent casualty of the crusade against free expression has been the radio
[04:12.040 --> 04:13.360]  show host Alex Jones.
[04:13.360 --> 04:17.360]  There is a concerted effort by the Democratic Party and multinational corporations in Big
[04:17.360 --> 04:21.160]  Tech to silence conservative and nationalist and populist voices.
[04:21.160 --> 04:25.760]  There's also guys on CNN that spend their whole day calling Facebook and saying, can
[04:25.760 --> 04:27.160]  you ban this person?
[04:27.160 --> 04:32.440]  He may be America's best known conspiracy theorist, but this week, Alex Jones' content
[04:32.440 --> 04:34.160]  will be a little harder to find.
[04:34.160 --> 04:38.440]  Shame on the mainstream corporate media for not defending the First Amendment, but instead
[04:38.440 --> 04:43.320]  attack dogging, calling for federal regulators to shut down independent, free press, working
[04:43.320 --> 04:44.760]  with Big Tech.
[04:44.760 --> 04:47.680]  People know what's true. They can smell it.
[04:47.680 --> 04:52.280]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[04:52.280 --> 04:57.640]  In a free country, everyone can be heard. In totalitarian societies, only the powerful
[04:57.640 --> 05:00.280]  can be heard.
[05:00.280 --> 05:06.280]  We are only offering three coins in the series. The first coin was released in December of
[05:06.280 --> 05:08.680]  2021 and sold out in 10 days.
[05:08.680 --> 05:16.440]  Now the second coin as we enter the last days of March into April 2022 is now being offered.
[05:16.440 --> 05:21.080]  I believe it will sell out in just a few days again because these are historic coins and
[05:21.080 --> 05:26.040]  because our amazing listeners want to support freedom and keep Infowars at the front lines
[05:26.040 --> 05:27.480]  of the fight against these tyrants.
[05:27.480 --> 05:37.200]  So go for yourself to 1776coin.com and see the new Liberty Tree Coin. It is powerful.
[05:37.200 --> 05:42.800]  Witness this powerful iconography for yourself and have this piece of history and be part
[05:42.800 --> 05:48.600]  of the founding member system that we're set to launch in the very near future, thanks
[05:48.600 --> 05:50.800]  to your support of this project.
[05:50.800 --> 05:57.160]  Get a historic memento that helps keep Infowars on the air and also gives you a real piece
[05:57.160 --> 06:11.440]  of history at 1776coin.com.
[06:11.440 --> 06:20.160]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[06:20.160 --> 06:28.960]  So I'm going to make an announcement here on air just to lay down a marker point for
[06:28.960 --> 06:36.480]  Tuesday, March 29, 2022 of where we are. We have all the evidence. We have the global
[06:36.480 --> 06:42.200]  statements. We have their white papers and now we have them putting it into action. 100%
[06:42.200 --> 06:48.160]  the multinational megabanks headed up with BlackRock and Vanguard and the private Federal
[06:48.160 --> 06:54.480]  Reserve have set China up to replace the United States and to be an authoritarian model of
[06:54.480 --> 07:03.560]  technocracy and global cashless society and we are 100% now being maneuvered into and
[07:03.560 --> 07:10.360]  we're now entering the official phase of the end of the dollar.
[07:10.360 --> 07:14.320]  Now for folks that aren't into the economy and into economics and into currencies and
[07:14.320 --> 07:21.400]  into what that means, this country will look like Venezuela in just a couple years if this
[07:21.400 --> 07:27.120]  actually happens. We will look like Zimbabwe or Weimar Republic Germany. That's all we
[07:27.120 --> 07:33.880]  had left was a giant military and the fact that we had the World Reserve currency. All
[07:33.880 --> 07:40.920]  of the major banks and the CIA and the entire federal government at the top is doing exactly
[07:40.920 --> 07:46.520]  what you do to burn down the US economy and shut us down and use economic warfare on us.
[07:46.520 --> 07:50.560]  Like if you wanted to burn down, let's say an old farmhouse that you didn't even want
[07:50.560 --> 07:55.720]  to pay to have a demolition. You can wait till it's a rainy time and there's no burn
[07:55.720 --> 08:00.240]  ban, call the fire department out and burn that sucker down. If that family burned down
[08:00.240 --> 08:05.400]  their old farmhouse, that's cheaper than hauling it off. What you do is you go in and you pour
[08:05.400 --> 08:09.000]  gasoline in all the rooms, you get it all set up and ready and then you throw a match
[08:09.000 --> 08:12.920]  in to it. So they've been pouring gasoline all over the country for a long time and now
[08:12.920 --> 08:18.200]  they throw the match in. The match goes spit into the air and in the last month it actually
[08:18.200 --> 08:23.320]  hit and now the house is engulfed in flame and it's going to burn to the ground. And
[08:23.320 --> 08:28.560]  it's all been done by the sun. It's being heralded from BBC to Al Jazeera to the Communist
[08:28.560 --> 08:36.360]  Chinese official daily. And of course the boogeyman in all of this is Russia as I said
[08:36.360 --> 08:40.680]  as General Flynn said and as all the smart geopolitical analysts said, Dr. Paul Craig
[08:40.680 --> 08:43.720]  Roberts and others, we should get him back on this week by the way, former head of the
[08:43.720 --> 08:49.160]  Treasury Department of Reagan. If we'd have made an alliance with Russia and turned them
[08:49.160 --> 08:54.600]  into a capitalist society and expanded, then we would be dominant for sure and could promote
[08:54.600 --> 08:59.880]  American values. But no, instead we became Communist China basically because the globalists
[08:59.880 --> 09:07.960]  that run our nation want us to be like Communist China. So it's all official and we have been
[09:07.960 --> 09:13.640]  directly maneuvered into this. So, you know, let's say a hundred years ago it might have
[09:13.640 --> 09:17.520]  taken a few months to build an old farmhouse and then it took a hundred years for it to
[09:17.520 --> 09:21.160]  get rotting and old and it takes about five minutes for one full of gasoline to burn to
[09:21.160 --> 09:34.920]  the ground. An old wooden farmhouse goes up like a Roman candle. So ladies and gentlemen,
[09:34.920 --> 09:42.440]  the house is on fire and they actually did it. They destroyed America. They took us down.
[09:42.440 --> 09:48.800]  Now the only reason I'm being as blunt as I am is there's some hope to lessen how bad
[09:48.800 --> 09:54.280]  this is going to be if we admit that they shipped in tons of fentanyl. They deliberately
[09:54.280 --> 09:59.280]  bankrupted the cities. They deliberately annihilated the family. They deliberately destroyed the
[09:59.280 --> 10:07.800]  border. They are absolutely publicly killing the dollar right now. And let's just get it
[10:07.800 --> 10:16.520]  out there. The good old days are over. And during the collapse of resources, do you think
[10:16.520 --> 10:19.880]  the average leftist is going to say, oh, I was wrong and try to change their policies?
[10:19.880 --> 10:25.480]  No. They're going to get more desperate, more insane, more feverish demanding wealth redistribution
[10:25.480 --> 10:31.200]  by the government administered by BlackRock and others who are going to have the World
[10:31.200 --> 10:36.400]  Social Credit Score System and the guaranteed universal basic income and make everyone quote
[10:36.400 --> 10:43.320]  shine on their wealth into a new digital global pool with China. So for this new global system
[10:43.320 --> 10:50.160]  to rise with China at the heart of it, America had to fall. And that's why Biden is shut
[10:50.160 --> 11:00.360]  down in 14 months, 15 months. Over 2,000 pipelines, thousands of other sub-pipelines,
[11:00.360 --> 11:06.840]  and we are under industrial military attack. Now that's just the start. Would you like
[11:06.840 --> 11:11.000]  me to give you the evidence today that we talked about in the last month or so but
[11:11.000 --> 11:26.200]  it was hard to believe. China and India, which collectively are 2.79 billion or almost 2.8
[11:26.200 --> 11:37.200]  billion people, almost half the world population, the largest part of the world economy combined,
[11:37.200 --> 11:46.280]  have officially left the dollar and the dollar is dropping and the ruble is exploding and
[11:46.280 --> 11:54.040]  we have been completely betrayed. And instead the globalists have got it all set up to censor
[11:54.040 --> 11:58.200]  everybody and shut everybody down and cause a civil war while they finish the country
[11:58.200 --> 12:05.880]  off. Great job, trendees and mainline conservatives and all of you that sat there and allowed
[12:05.880 --> 12:15.960]  this to happen. So all you folks that had a chip on your shoulder about America, all
[12:15.960 --> 12:20.120]  you weird leftists that were pissed as your grandpa or whatever, wasn't allowed in the
[12:20.120 --> 12:26.520]  Wasp Country Club and now you're Larry Fink so you're going to show America and destroy
[12:26.520 --> 12:32.560]  it all because somebody was mean to your grandpa. That's where we are now, ladies and gentlemen.
[12:32.560 --> 12:38.280]  Okay, Larry Fink you destroyed America. Down our head on the wall, congratulations buddy.
[12:38.280 --> 12:42.240]  But here's the thing, they think they're going to get away with what they've done to this
[12:42.240 --> 12:46.920]  nation and they're not going to get away with it in the end. And this isn't going to go
[12:46.920 --> 12:53.120]  the way they planned. It's going to lead to massive famine, global collapse, they wanted
[12:53.120 --> 12:56.600]  that but it's going to lead to war and it's going to lead to them being exposed and it's
[12:56.600 --> 13:03.160]  going to lead to them being in prison. So let me give you the news here. Rubel at the highest
[13:03.160 --> 13:07.000]  rate against US dollars since February 28th, they tried to take the rubble and it had the
[13:07.000 --> 13:11.840]  opposite effect. Russia has gotten more oil than anybody else on earth, more than US and
[13:11.840 --> 13:18.440]  Saudi Arabia and Venezuela combined and now it's going to sell unlimited oil to China
[13:18.440 --> 13:25.840]  and India because China and India don't take dollars anymore for oil and that's the World
[13:25.840 --> 13:30.440]  Reserve currency, that's the Bretton Woods Agreement after World War II, that's the whole
[13:30.440 --> 13:35.440]  system of the new world order after World War II, the new order, America as the British
[13:35.440 --> 13:40.680]  Empire and deliberately the people that run the British Empire, the American Empire are
[13:40.680 --> 13:51.120]  deliberately shutting us down to bring us to our knees and let China and other authoritarian
[13:51.120 --> 13:59.280]  regimes take over. While they put in a rotting, disintegrating puppet who can't even basically
[13:59.280 --> 14:04.760]  talk even with cue cards in his hands as the emblem of American weakness and death and
[14:04.760 --> 14:10.680]  I said then putting Biden in last year I said is the emblem of America's death you would
[14:10.680 --> 14:21.320]  only put him in as the symbol of hey the old years going out it's New Year's Eve 1159 and
[14:21.320 --> 14:25.280]  the year turns into a skeleton right in front of you and that year is gone and the new year
[14:25.280 --> 14:33.760]  begins the little baby and they are telling you it's over, they are telling you that they've
[14:33.760 --> 14:41.360]  done this. India refiners make fresh purchase of Russian oil despite US warning India will
[14:41.360 --> 14:50.760]  drop the dollar to trade with Russia replacing Swift. You take a look at the map of the world
[14:50.760 --> 14:55.920]  Russia and India and China and you get those guys working together it's game over global
[14:55.920 --> 15:01.880]  domination and that was done by design and we were maneuvering to that oh who was a four
[15:01.880 --> 15:06.680]  year respite they weren't just mad that Trump was taking charge they weren't just mad that
[15:06.680 --> 15:09.800]  a few of their operatives were being kicked out of government they were mad because he
[15:09.800 --> 15:13.840]  was going with an America first policy and made us the number one energy producer in
[15:13.840 --> 15:18.120]  the world overnight and that wasn't going along with their plan the world said wow America's
[15:18.120 --> 15:22.680]  not closed for business that's why the day he got elected the stock market exploded and
[15:22.680 --> 15:26.600]  everybody started investing here because they've been told don't come to America you can't set
[15:26.600 --> 15:31.760]  businesses up here you're not allowed to have factories you're not allowed to do all that
[15:31.760 --> 15:37.120]  and then Trump said that's over okay everybody flooded back and now soon as Biden came in
[15:37.120 --> 15:42.760]  they flipped the switch and it's all off and here we are ladies and gentlemen makes me
[15:42.760 --> 15:49.720]  physically sick I'm physically nauseous right now because I know what this means to my family
[15:49.720 --> 15:54.960]  I know what this means I mean you understand your country is literally dying on the operating

[19:09.360 --> 19:15.360]  to promote one thing from one of your co-host Owen shroyer super male volatility and brain

[19:20.320 --> 19:26.400]  really works it's cold pressed herbs and natural compounds that have never been heated up and so
[19:26.400 --> 19:31.840]  it has a dramatic effect compared to powdered versions they also work quite well they just
[19:31.840 --> 19:36.480]  aren't as strong this is like a very fine wine it's it's it's in fact each batch is different
[19:36.480 --> 19:39.920]  sometimes it's super strong sometimes it's just okay people like why are you selling
[19:39.920 --> 19:43.840]  something and admitting sometimes the batch isn't strong that's just how it is it's how it works
[19:44.720 --> 19:50.160]  so it's always good it's just sometimes it's like super strong but yeah if you want the rolls
[19:50.160 --> 20:04.960]  Royce at a decent price then this is it leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world
[20:04.960 --> 20:21.760]  order it's alex jones
[20:23.440 --> 20:32.160]  so we're now living in the future in the year 2022 powerful world central banks
[20:32.160 --> 20:40.320]  led by black rock and others publicly maneuvered the western governments they controlled
[20:41.040 --> 20:44.640]  into policies that triggered the russian invasion of ukraine
[20:46.880 --> 20:50.560]  and as larry fink said just a few months ago on bloomberg tv we prefer to work with
[20:50.560 --> 21:04.000]  dictators and criminals now he said that we'll play the clip in a moment and they're following
[21:04.000 --> 21:09.760]  everything you do like i was going to make hamburgers i'd go to the store try to get some
[21:09.760 --> 21:14.560]  fresh good hamburger meat get some buns get some lettuce tomatoes get to make sure i'd catch up
[21:14.560 --> 21:24.160]  a man is in hungry here uh any other type of relish people like and then i'd come home and
[21:24.160 --> 21:29.120]  i'd fire up the grill and i'd cook it and i'd bring it into the family and i'd put it on the
[21:30.000 --> 21:36.320]  buns and you know we'd eat dinner with salad or something and and that's what they're doing
[21:36.320 --> 21:40.000]  everything they do is just how you go and set something up and prepare it and lay it out
[21:40.000 --> 21:45.840]  it's like a surgery for amputating somebody's leg but
[21:47.360 --> 21:52.960]  said they're amputating our head they've got all the lights and the tools and the nurses
[21:52.960 --> 21:58.560]  and the doctors in there the surgeon and they've got a strap down and they're just draining our
[21:58.560 --> 22:04.880]  blood out slowly while we're awake laughing at us and you see i don't come in here and tell you
[22:04.880 --> 22:10.960]  how horrible this is and just to get you depressed i want you to know what's going to come next if
[22:10.960 --> 22:19.760]  we don't take action so it lights a fire under all of our asses to stop this because we told you
[22:19.760 --> 22:23.280]  they were maneuvering the country towards collapse while they claimed they were doing it all for
[22:23.280 --> 22:30.000]  america we told you they would end american energy dominance and actually shut us off and
[22:30.000 --> 22:35.280]  that you would have rolling power outages and massive inflation i told you that years ago
[22:35.280 --> 22:39.120]  that's the plan they've done it in the third world over and over again
[22:41.200 --> 22:45.760]  it's what the economic hitman and others came out and exposed many years ago
[22:47.680 --> 22:52.480]  it's how they operate and so you all ask yourselves i asked two years ago well we know
[22:52.480 --> 22:55.920]  these shots according to scientists that have researched what they're coming out with are going
[22:55.920 --> 23:00.720]  to cause blood clots and mass death what are they going to do to cover up all that death
[23:00.720 --> 23:05.680]  that delayed death that's going to happen and i said big wars and economic collapse
[23:11.200 --> 23:16.960]  because they want a post-industrial world and they want to depopulate us 80 to 90 percent
[23:16.960 --> 23:23.120]  in the official documents so how do you get from a to z what's the big cataclysm the end of the
[23:23.120 --> 23:29.920]  world event william shatner was talking about or aoc or beto or all of them were soon almost
[23:29.920 --> 23:36.320]  everybody's going to be dead that's because they are turning the planet's industrial life support
[23:36.320 --> 23:44.000]  off just on time delivery modern civilization fertilizers all of it medicine work real great
[23:44.000 --> 23:51.680]  when you've got it but it is a long chain and any sustained disruption will fry the entire system
[23:51.680 --> 23:58.400]  which then consolidates power and control for the likes of blackrock who openly brag and
[23:58.400 --> 24:03.760]  shareholder documents and others that have come out how great obola was when it came out and
[24:03.760 --> 24:07.600]  hunter biden's company saying oh we're going to double our money on this and and the same thing
[24:07.600 --> 24:14.480]  for covet and then the un points at the world famine exploding and mass death just accelerating
[24:15.120 --> 24:20.960]  and they say oh it was coveted and it was russia and it was but it was all the globalist it was
[24:20.960 --> 24:30.800]  all the new world order it was all their operation that did it and so my great frustration is we're
[24:30.800 --> 24:42.400]  not getting there we're here we're not getting there we've arrived and i wish we could have stopped
[24:42.400 --> 24:46.960]  this i knew they were going to launch a bio attack to bring out forced inoculations as it was in
[24:46.960 --> 24:51.680]  their documents made prediction after prediction their own record made films about it films seen
[24:51.680 --> 24:59.760]  by 60 70 80 million people didn't stop them and now we know the next phase world economic collapse
[24:59.760 --> 25:04.400]  civil war turning the police departments off letting criminals run around and murder whoever they want
[25:06.080 --> 25:10.080]  while the globalists sit in their giant armored fortresses in their huge palatial
[25:10.080 --> 25:16.480]  estates hundreds of thousands of acres with their private security firms and private landing fields
[25:16.480 --> 25:27.120]  just enjoying themselves while we all kill each other so let me tell you what's going to come next
[25:27.120 --> 25:39.360]  here if the sanctions aren't taken off russia immediately and if we don't start buying russian oil
[25:39.360 --> 25:47.600]  and gas it will continue to have china and india and hundreds of other countries switch to the
[25:47.600 --> 25:58.800]  ruble which will then kill the dollar as the world reserve currency and the bricks
[25:59.600 --> 26:05.520]  belton road initiative consortium trading system that they're now setting up will be the dominant
[26:05.520 --> 26:12.080]  system it already is overnight that's how america after world war two at the breton woods agreement
[26:12.080 --> 26:20.240]  they agreed that the world would buy and sell oil and coal and natural gas and the distillates
[26:20.240 --> 26:31.360]  of fossil fuels in the dollar and now the people running things oh they've gotten competent biden
[26:31.360 --> 26:35.840]  and sake and them up front but that's not it's running the people that did this knew damn well
[26:35.840 --> 26:41.920]  what they were doing and they guaranteed let old putin know hey you go ahead and do that
[26:43.520 --> 26:45.120]  you're going to be sitting a lot better position
[26:48.960 --> 26:56.080]  and so understand the people that run our country are deliberately doing things that are
[26:56.080 --> 27:02.160]  destroying the value of your money and your investments in your life while they collapse
[27:02.160 --> 27:07.200]  every other facet of the nation after they deindustrialized us and now they're shutting off
[27:07.200 --> 27:11.680]  our energy and our pipelines can anybody think about what that spells for us
[27:14.160 --> 27:19.760]  the long venezuela nightmare venezuela has more oil than anybody in latin america probably more
[27:19.760 --> 27:23.760]  than the united states they're one of the biggest oil producers in the world they're in the top five
[27:23.760 --> 27:28.800]  oil rich nations on earth and they can't even afford gasoline there because the communists
[27:28.800 --> 27:33.360]  stole it all and they want people poor and they want control and they have imf and world bank
[27:33.360 --> 27:40.160]  agreements to do that and the leaders in their congress all have giant chateaus in places like
[27:40.160 --> 27:49.280]  switzerland it's done on purpose just like keeping africa and latin america locked down for two years
[27:49.280 --> 27:54.320]  and causing mass starvation was under imf world bank agreements that came out and then people
[27:54.320 --> 27:58.400]  starve and they flood up here and then they're organized into political groups to then help
[27:58.400 --> 28:06.960]  bring down the united states this is a battle plan and so if we don't turn this around we come back
[28:06.960 --> 28:09.920]  i'm going to lay out what it's going to look like and what's going to happen and again i'm only
[28:09.920 --> 28:14.080]  telling you this like if you tell somebody hey you load that 12 gauge shotgun and you stick it in
[28:14.080 --> 28:18.000]  your mouth and you aim it at the top of your uh roof of your mouth you pull the trigger you're
[28:18.000 --> 28:21.120]  probably going to die or you're going to wish you were it's going to blow your brains out the back
[28:21.120 --> 28:29.920]  of your head well they've shoved the shotgun up in our mouth and they're in the process of pulling
[28:29.920 --> 28:37.440]  the trigger right now you think about that and this is such a spoiled demonic lazy nation on average
[28:37.440 --> 28:42.640]  can you even imagine what it's going to look like when people can't get food or water they can't
[28:42.640 --> 28:47.840]  get transportation well they're going to scream and yell and beg and say we'll do anything just
[28:47.840 --> 28:52.720]  give us money again and in comes black rock with the world social credit score and the
[28:52.720 --> 28:57.200]  universal basic income and everything else and oh we got to hold the middle class hostage now

[33:20.080 --> 33:30.000]  dot com studios you're listening to the alex jones show now i'm gonna lay out the rest of the really
[33:30.000 --> 33:36.640]  bad news and i'm gonna lay out the good news how we can stop it but only if the people really
[33:36.640 --> 33:45.040]  awaken to the scam and realize what they've been hit by there's a very narrow window where the dollar
[33:45.040 --> 33:50.480]  is not completely destroyed and we are not put into a crisis that will make the great depression
[33:50.480 --> 33:54.880]  look like a cakewalk because the globalists are doing it on purpose to bring us to our knees
[33:54.880 --> 34:00.800]  and have a communist revolution in america saying capitalism has failed the communist you know all
[34:00.800 --> 34:05.280]  the lazy punks and everybody are dancing around the street saying the end of america's nigh it's
[34:05.280 --> 34:09.920]  all about to go down they know now they believe they're about to be given a bunch of free stuff
[34:09.920 --> 34:14.800]  uh no they're not going to get any free stuff once this authoritarian revolution takes place
[34:16.080 --> 34:23.520]  because the poison of the takeover was the lgbtp and all the drugs and all of the you know bizarreness
[34:24.640 --> 34:30.320]  once the true authoritarianism hits that's all going to be thrown out the window and the new
[34:30.320 --> 34:36.000]  regime will blame all those people for what happened and persecute them and flush them out
[34:36.000 --> 34:41.920]  and then put competent people in with the new fascist order that's going to be set up so we're
[34:41.920 --> 34:48.560]  going to give you full spectrum analysis of where this is going here in just a moment now let me
[34:48.560 --> 34:56.240]  just uh spend a few minutes on this we cannot spend all our time and energy looking at how
[34:56.240 --> 35:01.600]  the globalists have shut down the country and deindustrialized us and uh just uh crawling
[35:01.600 --> 35:05.840]  a hole we've got to politically be engaged we've got to spiritually be engaged we've got to be
[35:05.840 --> 35:11.440]  reaching out and forming alliances and friendships with others and and and forming communities for
[35:11.440 --> 35:17.280]  this collapse this organized collapse and a lot of people are doing that and there's been a major
[35:17.280 --> 35:24.720]  instinctive and spiritual discernment to move out of the major cities and get prepared so
[35:24.720 --> 35:32.160]  so that's been happening for a long time and it's really again exploded uh in the last few years so
[35:32.880 --> 35:37.920]  all those preppers and people that told everybody to get ready 25 30 years ago have they not been
[35:38.720 --> 35:42.720]  proven right because they saw the preparation to bring down america they saw the preparation
[35:42.720 --> 35:46.880]  for gun confiscation and martial law they saw the government training manuals that were confirmed
[35:46.880 --> 35:51.120]  to be real about they're going to outlaw constitutionalists and uh you know set up
[35:51.120 --> 35:55.520]  FEMA camps and everything so military people particularly that were trained in this went
[35:55.520 --> 36:01.040]  public and good FBI agents and good members of congress that were read into this went public
[36:02.080 --> 36:06.880]  and some were killed and many were imprisoned and many were bankrupted and sued into oblivion
[36:06.880 --> 36:13.920]  so that we would know this was coming so now we've gotten a really good chance to turn this back
[36:13.920 --> 36:20.480]  and stop it because of all of those great people that spread the word for so long and of course
[36:20.480 --> 36:25.440]  much of this audience are people older than i am who've been in the trenches and have been fighting
[36:25.440 --> 36:32.160]  to get the word about the word out about this coming new world order so i salute you and i
[36:32.160 --> 36:36.560]  thank you for what you've done and what you persevered through and the criticism and the
[36:36.560 --> 36:42.560]  ridicule and the attacks and the persecution and the demonization you are trailblazers
[36:42.560 --> 36:49.840]  and the only reason we've got hope is because through god inspiring you through god inspiring
[36:49.840 --> 36:57.200]  you my children have a chance because we've known this is coming for a long time ladies and gentlemen
[36:57.200 --> 37:03.840]  and it's now here toe to toe with the globalist with every dirty trick they've got bio weapons
[37:03.840 --> 37:10.560]  with them posing as the saviors collapsing civilization degenerate pedophile society i mean
[37:10.560 --> 37:16.560]  this is modern warfare ladies and gentlemen and it is psychic and it is chemical and it is biological
[37:16.560 --> 37:30.000]  and it is economic and it is spiritual i want to get back into what's currently happening and how
[37:30.000 --> 37:34.880]  i think we could stop it and what's going to happen if we don't stop it and the indescribable hell
[37:34.880 --> 37:41.360]  that i'm going to try to lay out for you when i talk about this is is really hard for me to say
[37:41.360 --> 37:45.760]  because you folks know that i've told you a lot of things that came true exactly like i told you
[37:45.760 --> 37:52.480]  and i could see very very clearly what this is going to look like and uh it it's it's hard for a
[37:52.480 --> 37:57.680]  full grown pretty tough man to deal with okay so i want but i want you to understand it's better
[37:57.680 --> 38:02.720]  you know about all this and better you be ready for this they're going to hit the us with bio weapons
[38:02.720 --> 38:06.800]  they're going to basically try to kill everybody and the people that have taken the shot have been
[38:06.800 --> 38:13.120]  given the binary weapon where they'll be basically knocked completely over and almost all of them
[38:13.120 --> 38:17.920]  will die when they get hit with the next phase and man it's it's really sad to know that and i don't
[38:17.920 --> 38:24.160]  like to even say stuff like that on air because it's so horrible but it's it's true so there might
[38:24.160 --> 38:28.080]  be some mitigating factors there's some science on that about way people can detox from the from
[38:28.080 --> 38:33.440]  the spike proteins but the spike protein prions the crystals growing in your body the mad cow
[38:33.440 --> 38:41.600]  growing your body it's what it is it's an aids splice with mad cow hiv with mad cow who could
[38:41.600 --> 38:53.440]  come up with that just these people but hell we abort babies to say they're not humans and then
[38:53.440 --> 38:58.640]  keep them alive now and harvest their organs so i guess this is just judgment but you know my
[38:58.640 --> 39:02.960]  four-year-old daughter she doesn't deserve this i'm gonna do everything i can to try to stop this
[39:02.960 --> 39:09.920]  or try to try to do whatever i can but let me talk about staying on air we can stop this dollar
[39:09.920 --> 39:12.560]  collapse if there's a global awakening we understand how we've been maneuvered towards
[39:12.560 --> 39:16.400]  collapse and and we can stop the race war they're trying to start by exposing it which we've been
[39:16.400 --> 39:20.720]  doing and we can stop and get the majority of folks not to take the deadly shot if we keep
[39:20.720 --> 39:25.200]  exposing that whole program which we've done a great job you've done a great job of fighting
[39:25.200 --> 39:30.000]  and their whole cuban rollout did not go half as well as they wanted still devastating but
[39:31.280 --> 39:36.880]  we gave them a good run for their money and uh we're in the fight and i can't forget as
[39:36.880 --> 39:42.240]  serious and as bad as things are to remind you that you've got to spread the word to people
[39:42.240 --> 39:46.720]  and that's more important than ever so spreading the word so people know what's about to hit them
[39:46.720 --> 39:51.280]  and and what's happening so they don't get manipulated to serve the globalist against us
[39:51.280 --> 39:56.720]  is key plus god wants you to tell the truth and help people uh towards the knowledge and the like
[39:57.680 --> 40:00.880]  you've got to get ready with your family and friends and others for what's going down you
[40:00.880 --> 40:07.440]  got to get prepared that's number two and then again you've got to keep outlets on air that
[40:07.440 --> 40:12.880]  have built an independent system better than anybody else is out there more redundant than
[40:12.880 --> 40:17.840]  anybody else is out there because we've been on the front lines we had to by necessity as info wars
[40:17.840 --> 40:23.040]  and that doesn't mean they can't shut us down just like that but we're in the best position
[40:23.040 --> 40:27.840]  and there's not just evil in the world god's there god's real as well and god's more powerful than
[40:27.840 --> 40:32.000]  this evil infinitely but we have to take the step in the right direction and god's going to lead us
[40:32.000 --> 40:39.440]  the rest of the way so here's where we are um if you hadn't bought the last 1776 coin i would have
[40:39.440 --> 40:45.840]  had to lay off like 20 people that last coin funded us and uh and and our undrages of the last four or
[40:45.840 --> 40:51.280]  five months with three or four months and we've done a lot of other stuff with sponsors and things
[40:51.280 --> 40:57.280]  to to be almost breaking even we're a couple hundred thousand a month behind right now and so
[40:57.280 --> 41:01.600]  i was here by to go to infowarstore.com and get t-shirts get books get films buy some of the
[41:01.600 --> 41:06.240]  supplements particularly those that have never supported the broadcast but tune in routinely
[41:06.240 --> 41:10.560]  you need to get skin in the game and and really god wants to see that whether you go to a demonstration
[41:10.560 --> 41:14.960]  or whether you start praying more or whether you support us financially you need to not just be a
[41:14.960 --> 41:19.760]  spectator you need skin in the game that's how this metaphysically works i'm challenging those
[41:19.760 --> 41:23.040]  that have been on the fence about going infowarstore.com and buying products to do it
[41:24.400 --> 41:28.960]  also we have the second coin in a three-part series and if we're still on the air in a year
[41:28.960 --> 41:32.560]  or even a few months we're going to do a lot of special things for folks that are members
[41:32.560 --> 41:35.920]  that sign up and if you want to give us the email not you want to just support us to keep
[41:35.920 --> 41:41.680]  us on air that's fine but founding members are helping fund obviously other infrastructure and
[41:41.680 --> 41:47.040]  things we're doing that i'm not going to give out so the enemy's aware of it so we need all three
[41:47.040 --> 41:52.480]  coins to be sold at the cost they're at to complete this mission so this is your mission if you choose
[41:52.480 --> 41:56.960]  to accept it this is a real piece of history no matter what happens to us these are beautiful
[41:56.960 --> 42:01.840]  coins that i designed with a great designer and again there are only a few hundred as we held
[42:01.840 --> 42:07.360]  back of the george washington coin and we've now offered those at 1776coin.com those are selling
[42:07.360 --> 42:15.680]  out and we have this new coin that we've already sold 2,500 of in one day and we'll sell out by
[42:15.680 --> 42:21.840]  next week of this coin praise god so if you want the tree of liberty thomas jefferson quote coin

[45:09.280 --> 45:18.000]  that die no that invariably follows but first there is the crackdown on populations basic liberty
[45:18.000 --> 45:25.120]  and speech and massive censorship and now across the world from the united states to europe legislations
[45:25.120 --> 45:35.280]  being introduced that if you amplify any quote pro russian information you can be censored you
[45:35.280 --> 45:41.360]  can be arrested you can be imprisoned and of course now canada's under this legislation that if you
[45:41.360 --> 45:48.560]  have a thought crime and they think you may have the intent to engage in hate speech online that
[45:48.560 --> 45:53.440]  you will be censored and arrested ladies and gentlemen the authoritarianism is being carried
[45:53.440 --> 45:58.400]  out by the globalists around the world against humanity that makes info wars.com more important
[45:58.400 --> 46:04.480]  than ever ladies and gentlemen i need your help i need your help keeping info wars on the air and
[46:04.480 --> 46:10.560]  strong i need your help making sure that our mission continues on i was born for this you
[46:10.560 --> 46:16.480]  were born for this and people are really waking up right now but we had to build our own infrastructure
[46:16.480 --> 46:21.440]  because of the censorship and de-platforming that cost tens of millions of dollars and now
[46:21.440 --> 46:26.640]  with bandot video getting close to 10 million views a day we're a platform for thousands
[46:26.640 --> 46:33.120]  of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge and because
[46:33.120 --> 46:40.160]  it's become so successful it's a catch 22 info wars and bandot video have become a mothership
[46:40.160 --> 46:46.160]  promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions
[46:46.160 --> 46:51.040]  of dollars a quarter hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month so the biggest sale
[46:51.040 --> 46:56.240]  in info wars history is going right now the mega emergency blowout sale up to 75 off getting
[46:56.240 --> 47:04.080]  credible products and keep info wars as strong as ever leading a frontal assault on the lies of the
[47:04.080 --> 47:20.720]  new world order it's alex jones america betrayed the process of the destruction of the u.s dollar
[47:20.720 --> 47:28.880]  the last real power this country had the most important economic pillar for this country
[47:30.960 --> 47:36.800]  the only card we had left the ace of spades the most powerful card you can have in the world
[47:37.440 --> 47:43.920]  is not nuclear weapons not biological weapons not chemical weapons it's your currency being the
[47:43.920 --> 47:51.600]  currency of the world because then you can print basically almost unlimited amounts of money
[47:52.800 --> 47:57.920]  and it will cause slow inflation over time but it will give the people that can issue that fee
[47:57.920 --> 48:05.200]  out currency power to use that money to buy up infrastructure and to buy up academia and to buy
[48:05.200 --> 48:14.640]  up media and to totally control society but the federal reserve takeover by private families in
[48:14.640 --> 48:23.840]  europe the u.s and england was a hundred years old in 2013 now it's well over a hundred years old
[48:26.240 --> 48:31.120]  it's a hundred and nine years old and so it's time for that system to go away
[48:31.120 --> 48:38.400]  okay as the very same banking families accelerate the devaluation buying up real infrastructure
[48:39.520 --> 48:48.160]  passing on to us the inflation passing on to us the devaluation passing on to us the crime and
[48:48.160 --> 48:54.640]  poverty that they think they're insulated from as they prepare to move to the new global
[48:54.640 --> 49:02.560]  digital currency based on the communist chinese social credit score that was actually built by
[49:02.560 --> 49:09.840]  google and the globalist and so to make people go to that they've got to get china and russia and
[49:09.840 --> 49:17.040]  india and others which has now happened in just the last month officially today signing on to buy
[49:17.040 --> 49:31.600]  oil not in dollars but in an exchange of rupees yon rubles
[49:37.520 --> 49:45.200]  and that is the globalist takeover that is america completely crippled down to its knees
[49:45.200 --> 49:49.920]  have you tried to describe what the end of dollar hegemony means i mean it's just
[49:51.360 --> 49:54.480]  it's unspeakable bare minimum hyperinflation
[49:57.840 --> 49:59.920]  loss of confidence in us companies
[50:03.440 --> 50:09.040]  no longer will the u.s have any say over international transactions it'll kill
[50:09.760 --> 50:12.640]  the power of the u.s to actually have sanctions on groups that deserve it
[50:12.640 --> 50:22.080]  it's a complete and total transfer of power away from our republic the victors of world war two
[50:25.440 --> 50:28.000]  to black rock that basically manages communist china
[50:30.480 --> 50:34.320]  and you know putin did the calculus and he wants russia to be strong
[50:35.840 --> 50:40.080]  and so the globalists are going to try to empower china with this blame russia
[50:40.080 --> 50:44.160]  hurt russia and putin knows that but he believes that alliance is so strong
[50:44.160 --> 50:49.920]  that in the end in america so satanic and weak that russia will come out on top and even defeat
[50:50.800 --> 50:53.120]  some of the low-level globalists that want to take russia out
[50:55.200 --> 51:00.320]  and by the way that's what all the mainline analysts at the hoover and the kennedy center
[51:00.320 --> 51:04.880]  they all know this they all write books they all know it they're the ones type in the chinese
[51:04.880 --> 51:12.560]  century cfr.org for 30 years they said the new century the chinese century and the end of america
[51:14.800 --> 51:21.360]  and the new autocratic technocracy of china and now we're here endless money endless one-sided
[51:21.360 --> 51:29.440]  trade deals allowed to steal our intellectual property allowed to do anything they want ladies
[51:29.440 --> 51:35.600]  and gentlemen so that they would be hegemonic and in charge and then we hear oh china has stabbed
[51:37.840 --> 51:41.360]  the globalist new order in the back china is going to do its own thing it was always
[51:41.360 --> 51:50.240]  designed to do its own thing with larry fink and bloomberg and all these organizations that
[51:51.120 --> 51:52.480]  are completely predatory
[51:52.480 --> 52:00.800]  and then you look at what it'll look like in a disintegrating country
[52:04.240 --> 52:07.120]  with people think it's cool not to work or know any skills
[52:08.560 --> 52:11.840]  who've just been living off the largesse the dollar
[52:14.320 --> 52:20.240]  and all the people with their ebt cards that they'll still get the money put on the card but
[52:20.240 --> 52:25.760]  it's not going to buy what they need to even feed themselves what's that going to cause massive
[52:25.760 --> 52:35.120]  explosion in crime and breakdown of civilization you add to that 30 percent of women on psychotropic
[52:35.120 --> 52:41.040]  20 percent of men and all that the the the weaponized marijuana and and all the drugs
[52:41.680 --> 52:47.760]  just flowing into the united states we're like a christmas turkey all stuffed and loaded up going
[52:47.760 --> 52:51.920]  in the oven right now and i say that with great paying because there's still a lot of good people
[52:51.920 --> 52:57.200]  in america and we still had so many great ideals and so many great inventions and our best days
[52:57.200 --> 53:04.800]  were yet to come but we got bit by the new world order snake folks and we are poisoned now
[53:09.200 --> 53:14.160]  we are a poisoned nation ladies and gentlemen
[53:14.160 --> 53:20.480]  and we have to reject everything the globalists are saying everything they're doing because they're
[53:20.480 --> 53:25.520]  going to pose as the saviors against covid they made no lab and released they're going to pose as
[53:25.520 --> 53:31.760]  the saviors with a vaccine that gives you the same thing as covid they're going to pose as the
[53:31.760 --> 53:35.600]  saviors while they implode the border they're going to pose as the saviors while they start wars
[53:35.600 --> 53:42.880]  with russia and then put policies in place that they know will drive people out of the dollar
[53:42.880 --> 53:49.840]  into this new global digital system the china setup it's not like i'm just telling you that
[53:49.840 --> 53:54.800]  as it happens this week i was telling you that years ago decades ago but intensely the last two
[53:54.800 --> 54:01.680]  years saying we're being maneuvered to the end of the dollar and now the us threatens india not
[54:01.680 --> 54:11.520]  to start buying oil in rubles and india doesn't follow the threat because behind the scenes higher
[54:11.520 --> 54:20.080]  up wink wink the deals already been made and you know it has that's why biden said five weeks ago
[54:20.080 --> 54:27.120]  go ahead and invade just don't take the whole country and then putin now is pulling back from
[54:27.120 --> 54:32.480]  kiev he just pulled in to kill the forces that were in the east of ukraine he's about to take a
[54:32.480 --> 54:40.800]  third of the country that's what's going on and we've all been maneuvered and prepared
[54:43.360 --> 54:47.840]  for the whole thing but there's this weird delusion by academics and leftists and others
[54:48.480 --> 54:53.840]  of their yes culture and agreeing with each other and doing what they're told that they actually
[54:53.840 --> 55:00.720]  believe presiding over all of the destruction and the illogic somehow they're part of the team
[55:00.720 --> 55:10.160]  they're at the table you're not at the table and you're the exact people they plan on getting rid of
[55:10.160 --> 55:15.600]  and you've destroyed the real liberal social safety net and the real social contract and you've
[55:15.600 --> 55:21.040]  censored and you've spied and you've lied and you've persecuted you know i've got articles right
[55:21.040 --> 55:28.560]  here out of uh canada where they're holding more than a hundred people from the peaceful trucker
[55:28.560 --> 55:43.040]  event without bail and without charges just like january 6 and not letting lawyers see them that is
[55:43.040 --> 55:51.200]  in the ottawa newspaper like it's a good thing well they've been there now over a month and
[55:51.200 --> 55:59.920]  well they're not letting their lawyers get in to see them but that's okay and now they're arresting
[55:59.920 --> 56:06.240]  journalists on camera i mean it's north korea people like oh it's getting bad no folks it's not
[56:06.240 --> 56:15.680]  getting bad it's bad but we still have some vestigial ceremonial remembrance like a legend
[56:15.680 --> 56:19.520]  that we had to be processed and a right to self-defense and a right to free speech so
[56:19.520 --> 56:27.440]  here it's not as bad as europe or australia or canada because there's still some human memory
[56:27.440 --> 56:32.560]  of a time when we cared about freedom and i didn't throw the checks and balances
[56:32.560 --> 56:36.480]  and our life preservers out the window while we're in this sea of tyranny
[56:40.880 --> 56:45.040]  so we're to come back and i'm gonna actually go through four stacks that deal with this
[56:45.040 --> 56:52.480]  haven't hit these yet of what they're about to pull off here's a headline out of the financial post
[56:53.120 --> 57:01.120]  worth 20 trillion between them black rock and vanguard could own almost everything by 2028

[1:00:11.040 --> 1:00:15.040]  population but i wouldn't be happy until i have seized the ripest apple on the tree
[1:00:16.320 --> 1:00:22.160]  thee so i've said about however necessary to take over the united states president kennedy has
[1:00:22.160 --> 1:00:27.600]  been seriously wounded by the students i'd support the churches first i'd begin with a campaign of
[1:00:27.600 --> 1:00:32.560]  whispers with the wisdom of the serpent i would whisper to you as i whispered to you do as you
[1:00:32.560 --> 1:00:37.520]  please to the young i would whisper that the bible is a myth i would convince them that man created
[1:00:37.520 --> 1:00:43.120]  god the other way around i would confide that what's bad is good and what's good is sport and the
[1:00:43.120 --> 1:00:50.400]  old i would teach to pray after me our father which aren't in washington and then i'd get organized
[1:00:50.400 --> 1:00:54.880]  i'd educate authors in how to make the lord literature exciting so that anything else
[1:00:54.880 --> 1:01:00.320]  would appear dull and uninteresting i'd threaten tv with dirtier movies and vice versa i'd peddle
[1:01:00.320 --> 1:01:05.840]  narcotics to whom i could i'd sell alcohol to ladies and gentlemen of distinction i'd tranquilize
[1:01:05.840 --> 1:01:11.760]  the rest with pills if i were the devil i'd soon have families at war with themselves
[1:01:11.760 --> 1:01:17.520]  churches at war with themselves and nations at war with themselves until each in its turn
[1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:24.240]  consumed and with promises of higher ratings i'd have mesmerizing media fanning the plane
[1:01:24.240 --> 1:01:29.840]  the president of united states is racist if i were the devil i would encourage schools to
[1:01:29.840 --> 1:01:35.280]  decline young intellects but neglect the discipline of emotions just let those run wild within a decade
[1:01:35.280 --> 1:01:40.880]  i'd have prisons overflowing i'd have judges promoting pornography soon i could evict god from
[1:01:40.880 --> 1:01:46.320]  the courthouse then from the schoolhouse and then from the houses of congress and in his own churches
[1:01:46.320 --> 1:01:53.520]  i would substitute psychology for religion i would lure priests and pastors into misusing boys and
[1:01:53.520 --> 1:01:59.440]  girls and church money if i were the devil i'd take from those who have and give to those who
[1:01:59.440 --> 1:02:06.480]  wanted until i had killed the incentive of the ambitious i would caution against extremes i'm
[1:02:06.480 --> 1:02:11.920]  here to warn people you keep telling me to shut up this isn't a game in hard work in patriotism
[1:02:12.480 --> 1:02:17.840]  in moral conduct i would convince the young that marriage is old-fashioned that swinging is more
[1:02:17.840 --> 1:02:25.040]  fun that what you see on tv is the way to be and thus i could undress you in public and i could lure
[1:02:25.040 --> 1:02:31.680]  you into bed with diseases or which there is no cure in other words if i were the devil i'd just
[1:02:31.680 --> 1:02:56.160]  keep right on doing what he's doing now you know the rest of the story

[1:03:40.720 --> 1:03:45.040]  and they own all the big media companies so they control just about all the news and information

[1:03:53.200 --> 1:03:57.520]  people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork and just dumb enough
[1:03:57.520 --> 1:04:03.200]  to passively accept jobs with the lower pay the longer hours to reduce benefits the end of overtime
[1:04:03.200 --> 1:04:07.520]  and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it and now they're coming

[1:04:36.640 --> 1:04:43.200]  know the truth it's called the american dream because you have to be asleep to believe it but
[1:04:43.200 --> 1:04:48.160]  i'll tell you what they don't want they don't want a population of citizens capable of critical
[1:04:48.160 --> 1:04:52.400]  thinking they don't want well informed well educated people capable of critical thinking
[1:04:52.400 --> 1:04:56.400]  they're not interested in that that doesn't help them that's against their interest

[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:55.600]  10 or so times open the phones up i say hey i've got a topic i want to discuss i would like you
[1:06:55.600 --> 1:07:02.800]  to call in on this topic this topic only and it's what do you think of china and india and a bunch
[1:07:02.800 --> 1:07:10.240]  of other countries moving to the ruble to buy fuel and building their own digital banking system
[1:07:10.240 --> 1:07:16.720]  that they'd already basically set up in china and our leaders knew that would take america's greatest
[1:07:16.720 --> 1:07:22.800]  ace in the hole the dollar nothing's even a close second or close hundredth our military
[1:07:24.160 --> 1:07:31.520]  is trumped by this if the world reserve currency is no longer the dollar and this new global digital
[1:07:31.520 --> 1:07:37.760]  basket of currencies at the imf and world bank and black rock and larry think of wanting i mean
[1:07:37.760 --> 1:07:45.920]  this is their wish list i watch c-span and davos meetings for decades about their plan and i've
[1:07:45.920 --> 1:07:50.880]  i've seen them talk about it thousands of times i've got articles with videos of them saying it
[1:07:50.880 --> 1:07:56.800]  this week they are positioning us for total collapse they're shutting off our infrastructure
[1:07:56.800 --> 1:08:02.400]  imploding our borders pumping up the welfare system devaluing the dollar doing everything
[1:08:02.400 --> 1:08:07.040]  they can to get the world to dump the dollar and and getting biden there in kamala who they
[1:08:07.040 --> 1:08:18.320]  know have zero appeal with people to be emblematic of the end of the country so i don't say this
[1:08:18.960 --> 1:08:22.720]  to be negative it's like telling your three-year-old don't go out the street you can get run over and
[1:08:22.720 --> 1:08:27.760]  killed and i remember when i was about three i kept doing it one time my dad was driving down
[1:08:27.760 --> 1:08:32.720]  the street he was like let's pull over out here he pulled over there was this dead orange and white
[1:08:32.720 --> 1:08:37.040]  cat looked like garfield blood coming out of its nose all been run over not before down the street
[1:08:37.680 --> 1:08:43.600]  kids were drag racing my dad said and that cat was all rigor mortis with blood coming out of
[1:08:43.600 --> 1:08:48.800]  its nose and my dad said that's what she'll be like if you keep going out the street because
[1:08:48.800 --> 1:08:53.200]  i'd climb out a window my mom would like be cleaning or doing something and i just she'd lock the
[1:08:53.200 --> 1:08:58.320]  doors because i'd you know run out the backyard and just be gone and we lived in an area dallas
[1:08:58.320 --> 1:09:02.000]  that you know wasn't super nice but wasn't super bad but it was still i mean i was just out of
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:08.960]  control like a raccoon or something myself and i'd open a window up and go outside had to be
[1:09:08.960 --> 1:09:13.840]  watched i'd climb on neighbors roofs i'd climb up their vans i i mean i was a little animal
[1:09:15.040 --> 1:09:19.360]  and my dad spanked me and stuff didn't work so he wouldn't show me that raccoon or that uh
[1:09:20.640 --> 1:09:27.280]  that dead cat he also showed me dead raccoon ones and said you've got to stop you'll be run over
[1:09:27.280 --> 1:09:36.960]  you will be smashed flattered in the pancake and i remember that like it was yesterday and i was
[1:09:36.960 --> 1:09:40.560]  like two and a half three years old and then i still stuck out again there was this old guy
[1:09:40.560 --> 1:09:43.520]  that actually owned the house my parents were renting that lived on the street he owned like half
[1:09:43.520 --> 1:09:50.000]  the houses named mr bruner and i remember him just his yesterday and his overalls he's always
[1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:55.120]  giving me candy and stuff he goes get over here alex he goes let me show you this it was a great
[1:09:55.120 --> 1:09:59.360]  spot on the ground he goes you see that that's a little boy went out the street to smash his
[1:09:59.360 --> 1:10:04.400]  like a dead little booger so promise me you're not going to go back in that street and listen i
[1:10:04.400 --> 1:10:10.960]  don't know why i'm telling you these stories the point is i'm telling you this because i i'm not
[1:10:10.960 --> 1:10:16.320]  trying to be negative or scare you for no reason this is real ladies and gentlemen
[1:10:16.320 --> 1:10:25.840]  this is horrible this is wrong and all the dumb bureaucrats on tv and the politicians and the
[1:10:25.840 --> 1:10:31.360]  judges and the idiot lawyers and all of them don't understand the music stopping the musical
[1:10:31.360 --> 1:10:37.520]  chairs are over and we're the one left without a seat we have been royally screwed
[1:10:40.400 --> 1:10:45.920]  and then you learn about what's going to happen with the social engineering during this long
[1:10:45.920 --> 1:10:52.560]  protracted depression where we're taught the new way and we build back better by collapsing what we
[1:10:52.560 --> 1:10:58.160]  were so let's put the show headline up on screen for people but i'm a certain one of these headlines
[1:10:59.040 --> 1:11:02.080]  but i really want to give the number out i want to take your calls on this topic
[1:11:02.640 --> 1:11:09.840]  specifically because if there's a big enough uproar and if there's a big enough awakening and if
[1:11:09.840 --> 1:11:18.640]  there was enough courage in congress and about governors and by legislators and if trump could
[1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:23.600]  figure this out or if the santa's could figure it out then there might be some hope but these
[1:11:23.600 --> 1:11:29.040]  politicians even if they're good people they all look at it one dimensionally about okay is it a
[1:11:29.040 --> 1:11:34.560]  policy that's good for america and do and will it make me look good even the good ones are like that
[1:11:34.560 --> 1:11:37.520]  the bad ones are like who's paying me and what makes me look good the media
[1:11:37.520 --> 1:11:44.960]  but for the trump or the santa's or anybody yeah sanctions on russia yeah war makes them sound good
[1:11:45.840 --> 1:11:49.600]  but the globalists did something and made a deal with putin invade you know that
[1:11:50.880 --> 1:11:57.680]  to get america to go it's against its own interest and do these sanctions which would put russia
[1:11:57.680 --> 1:12:05.040]  already in a dominant position energy wise into the main position of power how do you get a trump
[1:12:05.040 --> 1:12:11.760]  or a desantis or a senator paul or cruz to come out and say that they they're not going to do it
[1:12:12.880 --> 1:12:16.640]  they don't believe the people are sophisticated enough to know this and i'll guarantee you that
[1:12:16.640 --> 1:12:23.760]  desantis and i'll guarantee you that senator cruz and senator paul are all as smart as i am
[1:12:23.760 --> 1:12:30.240]  they all know this trump probably not uh he's not dumb he just is just in his own world so so
[1:12:30.240 --> 1:12:43.440]  this is really bad and all i'm saying is we should instantly slam on the brakes and say
[1:12:44.000 --> 1:12:48.960]  instead of all this this posturing oh we'll show you putin will stop buying your fuel and your gas
[1:12:48.960 --> 1:12:53.680]  yeah and then he just gets the whole world other than you know a few european countries and us
[1:12:53.680 --> 1:12:59.360]  to switch away and a lot of folks will say well screw the dollar and screw this and we're sick of
[1:12:59.360 --> 1:13:03.120]  the american empire do you understand that the globalists that have been running the american
[1:13:03.120 --> 1:13:09.600]  empire and sucking us dry to do this and deindustrializing us they are the ones that are doing this
[1:13:09.600 --> 1:13:15.600]  this is what they want it isn't about are the russians right or the ukrainians right it isn't
[1:13:15.600 --> 1:13:20.400]  about how many ukrainian flags you put on your twitter how many russian flags it's about pulling
[1:13:20.400 --> 1:13:26.720]  back to the 35 000 foot view and going oh my gosh they're using this to move people off the dollar
[1:13:26.720 --> 1:13:32.720]  onto this new digital global index of basket of currencies that the globalists can manipulate and
[1:13:32.720 --> 1:13:37.920]  control and screw everybody around the world because now the world reserve currency will be
[1:13:37.920 --> 1:13:44.400]  controlled by the central banks completely and there won't be any input from america or congress
[1:13:44.400 --> 1:13:50.880]  or anybody else so the morons in congress just get paid off they're not even smart enough to figure
[1:13:50.880 --> 1:13:57.120]  this out or want real power because they could parlay this right now a ted cruise or a senator paul
[1:13:57.120 --> 1:14:03.760]  or josh holly uh or any of these people but are they doing it because it's in the economist and
[1:14:03.760 --> 1:14:08.400]  it's in the financial times and it's all known it's not even debatable what i'm telling you is
[1:14:08.400 --> 1:14:16.320]  like known policy globally so yeah when when biden says it's the end of the new world order
[1:14:16.320 --> 1:14:21.040]  and that russia and china have set up a new world order but america needs to lead the new world order
[1:14:21.040 --> 1:14:26.320]  he's actually being honest in his all simers he's saying we the former people that ran america
[1:14:26.320 --> 1:14:31.680]  have screwed over we're handing the baton to china and russia for the new world order he's actually
[1:14:31.680 --> 1:14:37.360]  up there wheeling around all crazy cfr member with richard and haus who admitted this was the
[1:14:37.360 --> 1:14:43.360]  plan all along and they're doing it and instead we're debating about who's committing more war

[1:19:56.560 --> 1:20:05.120]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:20:13.920 --> 1:20:21.120]  so while lessoners argued about what a man a woman was the big banks cut off the energy
[1:20:21.120 --> 1:20:28.480]  the value of the currencies and accelerated the collapse of civilization it was winston
[1:20:28.480 --> 1:20:33.760]  church hill as world war two was really kicking off and as british forces have been forced out of
[1:20:35.440 --> 1:20:44.800]  france at the battle of duncork that he said i have nothing to offer but blood toil and tears
[1:20:44.800 --> 1:20:52.640]  and sweat we have before us an ordeal the most grievous kind we have before us many many long
[1:20:52.640 --> 1:21:01.520]  months of struggle and suffering then he went on to basically say all of that is terrible
[1:21:02.240 --> 1:21:07.200]  but i'm being honest with you because it's better to know what you're facing and deal with defeated
[1:21:07.200 --> 1:21:15.280]  than the alternative that is far worse and then he laid that out as well so i'm not like to cue
[1:21:15.280 --> 1:21:20.800]  people that tell you a bunch of lies and i really like michael indell who i don't think was lying
[1:21:20.800 --> 1:21:25.040]  but he was overly hopeful about trouble being reinstated and everything's pie in the sky and i
[1:21:25.040 --> 1:21:29.600]  told him you know a year ago i said you need to stop that you're a good guy the election was a fraud
[1:21:29.600 --> 1:21:33.760]  we need to let folks know it's a long hard fight they're gonna steal the next election you need to
[1:21:33.760 --> 1:21:39.760]  make it about stopping the next theft and he just is a great guy but the energy and the
[1:21:39.760 --> 1:21:44.080]  attention he was getting to tell people what they wanted to hear was too much for him you don't tune
[1:21:44.080 --> 1:21:51.520]  in here to get sugarcoated crap you're gonna get some of the best thinking on what's going down
[1:21:52.720 --> 1:21:55.920]  and that's because i believe in you and i believe when you know what you're facing
[1:21:57.120 --> 1:22:00.400]  you're gonna take action in different ways and all of us collectively together
[1:22:00.400 --> 1:22:05.120]  many hands make light work we're going to not lay down to this we're going to be aware of what's
[1:22:05.120 --> 1:22:10.560]  happening to us so we have the real narrative to counter their engineered collapse and their
[1:22:10.560 --> 1:22:15.680]  engineered virus that's supposed to bring in their new casual society and their universal basic
[1:22:15.680 --> 1:22:21.440]  income that can only happen once they've collapsed things they're writing books about it they give
[1:22:21.440 --> 1:22:26.960]  speeches about it i can play you hours of clips of debos group with claus Schwab and others saying
[1:22:26.960 --> 1:22:32.480]  why do we need so many people we need to get rid of people this is an attack on you this is modern
[1:22:32.480 --> 1:22:40.560]  warfare war never looks like the last war and this doesn't look like any war you see in movies
[1:22:40.560 --> 1:22:46.000]  with aliens landing with laser beams this is economic this is cultural this is biological
[1:22:46.000 --> 1:22:50.000]  this is total unrestricted warfare against you and your family
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:54.720]  your family so we just run through these headlines right now
[1:22:55.840 --> 1:22:58.800]  ruble at highest rate against the u.s dollar ever
[1:23:00.800 --> 1:23:07.520]  and in refineries despite western threats have now moved to buying oil in the rubble from the russians
[1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:14.080]  india now dropping the digital global swift system they're using to sanction russia and so has china
[1:23:14.080 --> 1:23:19.840]  launching their own new system a month ago and now it's up and running and the dollar is dropping
[1:23:20.720 --> 1:23:24.480]  we're losing and our own leaders did it by design
[1:23:25.920 --> 1:23:32.800]  look at this shutting canadian pipelines will cost us consumers 23.7 billion a year in a big
[1:23:32.800 --> 1:23:44.240]  report but of course it's not enough biden's moving to break a treaty and shut down another
[1:23:44.240 --> 1:23:51.360]  popping is putin doing that everything's being done to shut us down government minister tells
[1:23:51.360 --> 1:23:55.760]  germans to cope with soaring energy costs by wearing warmer sweaters
[1:23:55.760 --> 1:24:04.320]  oil's entering a new world order here are the big winners and the losers china black rock the big
[1:24:04.320 --> 1:24:12.560]  hedge funds the banks russia india who pays europe america england australia but we're the target
[1:24:12.560 --> 1:24:21.680]  and we keep not getting that oh then the world food program is out oh not just 40 million are
[1:24:21.680 --> 1:24:25.040]  going to starve to death like extra did in the last few years hundreds of millions are gonna die which
[1:24:25.040 --> 1:24:29.120]  is all true they engineered the lockdown they engineered at all and now they need you to
[1:24:29.120 --> 1:24:35.680]  give them billions to feed people which they're not going to feed people so now we've got double
[1:24:35.680 --> 1:24:45.200]  the number from 135 million the verge of dying to 276 million and it goes on and on and on
[1:24:45.200 --> 1:24:52.400]  let's look at some more what they're up to right here
[1:24:55.200 --> 1:25:01.600]  with 20 trillion between them black rock and vanguard same people could own almost everything
[1:25:01.600 --> 1:25:08.560]  by 2028 financial post and it goes on to describe how they basically run the world
[1:25:09.200 --> 1:25:14.160]  run china run america run everything and then they run all the leftist engineering
[1:25:14.160 --> 1:25:21.280]  and they run it black rock the program demanding decarbonization in europe the uk and the us and
[1:25:21.280 --> 1:25:29.520]  canada australia new zealand but nowhere else so you can't use dollars anymore and you gotta move
[1:25:29.520 --> 1:25:34.000]  to china india but they're allowed to have all the coal power plants they want it's real simple
[1:25:34.000 --> 1:25:39.360]  they're turning our lights off and turning their lights on while the news tells you they're at war
[1:25:39.360 --> 1:25:46.800]  with putin and even mainline conservatives are like yeah sock it to them putin show biden what
[1:25:46.800 --> 1:25:53.680]  an idiot is and it's all at the higher level states and putin knows that and so does ggp
[1:25:54.880 --> 1:26:01.280]  so it's just levels of idiocy and you go to twitter instagram it's just thousands of tweets
[1:26:01.280 --> 1:26:06.800]  an hour arrest alex jones he's a russian agent kill him shoot him murder him
[1:26:06.800 --> 1:26:13.600]  and meanwhile i'm actually trying to stop the destruction of the us dollar and us power
[1:26:17.920 --> 1:26:24.000]  but see that's being informed living in the real world not these people prepared for destruction
[1:26:24.000 --> 1:26:32.480]  so yeah i guess that's what satan does is he gets you to humanize and dumb down and and moronic
[1:26:32.480 --> 1:26:39.760]  an evil before you get destroyed that's how the universe works so i guess we just deserve
[1:26:40.480 --> 1:26:46.400]  what's about to happen to us oh look at this article though out of the hill black rock sponsored
[1:26:46.400 --> 1:26:52.000]  of course people over 60 account for a third of greenhouse gas emissions we need to go ahead
[1:26:52.000 --> 1:26:56.560]  and euthanize them like a zealom annual that rhodo obamacare said they've got it all lined up and
[1:26:56.560 --> 1:27:04.400]  prepared decades in the making that just came out a few days ago isn't that sweet oh my god to save
[1:27:04.400 --> 1:27:10.800]  the earth humans put off carbon that plants breathe that's dangerous mammals are bad
[1:27:12.800 --> 1:27:18.640]  is this the borg saying this no it's the globalist oh but larry fink he's not going to be getting
[1:27:18.640 --> 1:27:26.400]  euthanized though nested susan tweeted this out the oceans are rising rapidly they said we'd be
[1:27:26.400 --> 1:27:31.920]  feet underwater by 2017 and we'll soon swallow up our coastal areas but rock obama is at one
[1:27:31.920 --> 1:27:39.760]  foot level above sea level so is nancy polosi and so is bill gates no they're doing just fine
[1:27:39.760 --> 1:27:45.840]  but we're not doing just fine you think when grain prices triple all-time highs that hurts bill gates
[1:27:45.840 --> 1:27:51.280]  no but that starves the third world to death then they collapse and they flood us and the
[1:27:51.280 --> 1:27:59.600]  un and bill gates then control that operation the good news is biden's approval rating falls
[1:27:59.600 --> 1:28:05.360]  to record low amid soaring inflation high gas prices but the bad news is people are rejecting
[1:28:05.360 --> 1:28:12.560]  the evil but they believe it's biden doing it when he's just a placeholder and a puppet
[1:28:12.560 --> 1:28:24.560]  but the rich are leech to say let them eat cake but of course you're not a biologist you can't
[1:28:24.560 --> 1:28:29.840]  say what a woman is so you can't have any more tweets because you're not a tweeterologist right
[1:28:29.840 --> 1:28:35.280]  or you can't even tell folks it's raining because you're not a meteorologist but here's black rock
[1:28:35.280 --> 1:28:40.080]  ceo larry thinks this rush of ukraine war is upending world order but when we say it it
[1:28:40.080 --> 1:28:46.160]  doesn't exist we're not allowed to because well the riders over the new york times say so and bill
[1:28:46.160 --> 1:28:51.040]  gates is announcing you'll never get beef again it should be outlawed for the earth but only here
[1:28:51.040 --> 1:28:59.360]  everywhere else will have it boy these are some sick people we are only offering three coins in
[1:28:59.360 --> 1:29:06.560]  the series the first coin was released in december of 2021 and sold out in 10 days now the second
[1:29:06.560 --> 1:29:13.920]  coin as we enter the last days of march into april 2022 is now being offered and i believe
[1:29:13.920 --> 1:29:18.720]  it will sell out in just a few days again because these are historic coins and because our amazing
[1:29:18.720 --> 1:29:23.680]  listeners want to support freedom and keep info wars at the front lines of the fight against these
[1:29:23.680 --> 1:29:33.600]  tyrants so go for yourself to 1776 coin dot com and see the new liberty tree coin it is powerful

[1:30:00.800 --> 1:30:09.200]  in a three-part series the 1776 anti tyrant coin and it sold out in 10 days and if it wasn't for
[1:30:09.200 --> 1:30:16.480]  listeners getting this original powerful coin a founding member coin we would not be on air today
[1:30:16.480 --> 1:30:23.200]  now the second coin the liberty tree coin is being offered and it will probably sell out in 10 days
[1:30:23.200 --> 1:30:29.600]  again it certainly needs to the front of operation it is so historic and it has a quote from thomas
[1:30:29.600 --> 1:30:35.360]  jefferson about the tree of liberty being refreshed the blood of patriots and tyrants and more see

[1:30:47.520 --> 1:30:53.200]  something very very special for everyone that helps us go to the next level so get your new tree of
[1:30:53.200 --> 1:30:59.040]  liberty coin while you still can at 1776 coin dot com the first ten amendments to our country's
[1:30:59.040 --> 1:31:05.840]  constitution were adopted in 1791 the first of these broadly protects the rights of free speech
[1:31:05.840 --> 1:31:12.720]  and free press free speech means the free and public expression of opinions without censorship
[1:31:12.720 --> 1:31:20.080]  interference and restraint by the government 231 years later free speech across america is under
[1:31:20.080 --> 1:31:27.360]  chronic and insidious attack gcn is under attack your freedom is currently under siege from those
[1:31:27.360 --> 1:31:33.840]  who do not want you to know the truth i'm asking our fellow broadcasters and you to rise up and
[1:31:33.840 --> 1:31:40.320]  help us defend our right to continue telling you the truth would you like to join us if so please

[1:31:52.480 --> 1:31:57.920]  select all of those choices i'm vidsant finnelli mike in california thanks for calling i think
[1:31:57.920 --> 1:32:03.280]  we're barking up the wrong tree calling this gain of function research now if you read the actual
[1:32:03.280 --> 1:32:09.040]  you know 2014 legislation the u.s government gain of function deliberative process and research
[1:32:09.040 --> 1:32:14.640]  funding pause on selected gain of function research involving influenza mers and zars virus
[1:32:14.640 --> 1:32:20.400]  there's nothing about zars like viruses and if the research funding paused it's not a stop it's not a
[1:32:20.400 --> 1:32:24.720]  prohibition it's when you come to a four-way intersection there's the stops on you stop you
[1:32:24.720 --> 1:32:29.680]  look both ways and then you proceed and so it's also it doesn't pause all gain of function just
[1:32:29.680 --> 1:32:34.160]  selected gain of function but they'll argue that this is actually characterization and
[1:32:34.160 --> 1:32:39.040]  qualification research so you know rand and others you know maybe fouchy was right they don't quite
[1:32:39.040 --> 1:32:42.480]  know what they're talking about calling it gain of function you know that's why he didn't purge
[1:32:42.480 --> 1:32:46.640]  her himself that's why he hasn't been arrested because they're literally creating new synthetic
[1:32:46.640 --> 1:32:51.840]  live forms that mimic what the viruses do but in the main definition it's still a gain of function
[1:32:51.840 --> 1:32:55.760]  you're making something deadly that spreads more easily to hurt people thank you mike we love you
[1:32:58.960 --> 1:33:04.960]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[1:33:04.960 --> 1:33:18.240]  from the front lines of the information war it's alex jones
[1:33:21.440 --> 1:33:27.440]  talking about the purposeful collapse of the u.s. dollar by design by the criminals that set up
[1:33:27.440 --> 1:33:33.520]  communist china that run our government today it is just an unprecedented moment can we get enough
[1:33:33.520 --> 1:33:37.280]  people talking about this because it took us a year to get people awake to the deadly vaccines
[1:33:37.920 --> 1:33:43.040]  it takes us a long time once we get going this audience this show we're really the tip of the
[1:33:43.040 --> 1:33:49.200]  spear when it comes to foiling their plans but we don't have much time now because we told you
[1:33:49.200 --> 1:33:53.120]  they're going to move into war and economic disaster in the end of the dollar to bring in
[1:33:53.120 --> 1:33:59.360]  the new global currency i told you that years ago i said the next phase after covet will be war
[1:33:59.360 --> 1:34:06.320]  and economic disaster and de-dollarization because that's next up on the agenda not going to waste
[1:34:06.320 --> 1:34:09.840]  your time playing clubs to me saying it most of you heard me say it 50 times
[1:34:12.560 --> 1:34:17.680]  but what comes next after this and i want to go to your calls first it's just such a big topic i
[1:34:17.680 --> 1:34:21.920]  should do like a three-hour commercial free show or something just on what the end of the dollar is
[1:34:21.920 --> 1:34:28.720]  going to look like and what it's going to cause it makes my head spin there's so much just it's

[1:38:01.120 --> 1:38:05.760]  court hearings it was confirmed just a few years ago but i i talked to nurses inside people at these
[1:38:05.760 --> 1:38:11.360]  universities they just even what they were liberals and pro-abortion they were like a living nine-month
[1:38:11.360 --> 1:38:15.840]  old baby just got delivered we're gonna like do experiments on this is a human this ain't a lab
[1:38:15.840 --> 1:38:21.120]  rat i mean i i knew that 10 years ago and told you okay and then now it's come out in court
[1:38:21.120 --> 1:38:26.480]  hearings i mean this is real okay the same again people and it's the same thing here with the dollar
[1:38:26.480 --> 1:38:34.880]  maybe you don't care about babies okay maybe you don't care about them but but but you better care
[1:38:34.880 --> 1:38:39.920]  that evil people are in charge that would do that because they'll hurt you too you idiots i'm talking
[1:38:39.920 --> 1:38:49.280]  about leftist like what is your problem and and then do you know what the end of the dollar means

[1:39:48.080 --> 1:39:51.520]  you see i've been trying to stop this for 28 years so this isn't an act up here when i started
[1:39:51.520 --> 1:39:57.280]  hyper hyperventilating and stuff this is 100 real folks because i i tried with everything in my body
[1:39:57.280 --> 1:40:02.720]  to stop this and my total will has been turned against this and we we slowed it down together
[1:40:02.720 --> 1:40:07.840]  but it's it's now coming in and it's just it's just it's pedophiles all over tv bragging how
[1:40:07.840 --> 1:40:11.440]  they have our children i've got stacks of that i mean it's just and this is just the start
[1:40:13.760 --> 1:40:17.520]  and i don't worry about me but i do worry about my children other people's children
[1:40:17.520 --> 1:40:21.840]  that's all i think about that's instinctive for me like any other mammal to protect our children
[1:40:21.840 --> 1:40:28.000]  and it's just my mind and my soul is literally kicking me in the head right now saying you
[1:40:28.000 --> 1:40:36.560]  are a punk jones you are a freaking loser you knew what they were gonna do and you couldn't stop them
[1:40:38.560 --> 1:40:44.400]  and i'll be honest it makes me hate the public too as much as i'm mad at myself that we knew
[1:40:44.400 --> 1:40:49.120]  this was going on we couldn't stop it whatever i'm just gonna do the best i can here's a video
[1:40:50.080 --> 1:40:54.560]  out of san francisco of a man who hopped out of his brain to store robbing things
[1:40:54.560 --> 1:40:59.280]  he's got a fire extinguisher it looks like a bag of chips in his hands and another dude just gets
[1:40:59.280 --> 1:41:02.480]  sick of it and cracks him over the heck because nobody will stop what's going on and everybody
[1:41:02.480 --> 1:41:08.640]  chases him to arrest him and and and again this is the zombie possession of america this is the
[1:41:08.640 --> 1:41:24.800]  chemical attack with the drugs on us roll it with audio here it is standing there for radio
[1:41:24.800 --> 1:41:29.600]  listeners on their way with a fire extinguisher it looks like a bag of chips uh and then the
[1:41:29.600 --> 1:41:38.960]  guy comes and hits him with a display tower the back of the head oh my god
[1:41:41.120 --> 1:41:47.200]  and now the naked usher daddy's naked the naked zombie guy now chases the other black man out
[1:41:47.200 --> 1:41:52.000]  of the thing because he's been a white guy to be all the hate crime news he got what looks like
[1:41:52.000 --> 1:42:00.400]  one somali or maybe the ethiopian tasting another ethiopian everybody's just like nine one one
[1:42:00.400 --> 1:42:09.520]  nine one one nine one one lock the door lock the door and they're all wearing their mask and the
[1:42:09.520 --> 1:42:15.680]  women all think they're chic and they're all just people submitting to the system when they think
[1:42:15.680 --> 1:42:20.480]  the systems are to save them when the systems are to destroy you we're gonna i mean i've got just
[1:42:20.480 --> 1:42:25.520]  hours of stuff like this it is zombie world out there but i don't need to look at it on youtube

[1:42:32.480 --> 1:42:37.280]  like just third world people living down there everywhere and again it's just a collapse of the
[1:42:37.280 --> 1:42:43.280]  country all about design and the average person doesn't even know why their gas prices are up
[1:42:43.280 --> 1:42:47.760]  and has no idea that if you think gas prices are bad now they'll be ten dollars a gallon
[1:42:47.760 --> 1:42:52.720]  twenty dollars a gallon of the dollar devalues which is happening now the end of the dollar we'll

[1:43:17.920 --> 1:43:23.920]  and now with bandot video getting close to ten million views a day we're a platform for thousands
[1:43:23.920 --> 1:43:30.400]  of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge and because

[1:43:36.560 --> 1:43:42.960]  mothership promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide but the expenses in bandwidth alone are
[1:43:42.960 --> 1:43:48.080]  millions of dollars a quarter hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month so the biggest

[1:48:34.560 --> 1:48:39.760]  well what do you think that's going to do to the precious metals prices now if you will only accept
[1:48:39.760 --> 1:48:46.320]  payment and precious metals jp morgan all these massive banks that have been artificially holding
[1:48:46.320 --> 1:48:50.240]  the negative shorting and it's going to destroy them yeah i know but i'm saying the globalists
[1:48:50.240 --> 1:48:55.600]  aren't dumb they started an economic war with russia that they were running in china that they knew
[1:48:55.600 --> 1:49:00.160]  would kill america what i'm saying they're doing it on purpose brother well well here's the second
[1:49:00.160 --> 1:49:06.400]  thing i if you're an investor on the street right at all this global uncertainty i thought you know
[1:49:06.400 --> 1:49:11.200]  what i'm gonna buy some russian stock i'm gonna buy a little energy you know gas pumps and these
[1:49:11.200 --> 1:49:16.320]  other big well you can't buy the stock these stocks have been trading on a 12 month for you know
[1:49:16.320 --> 1:49:21.200]  80 to 100 dollars they're one and two dollars now so the average joe investor like me that says hey
[1:49:21.200 --> 1:49:26.160]  you know what i'm gonna take five grand and i'm gonna buy a russian stock and when it goes back
[1:49:26.160 --> 1:49:30.880]  to where it was you know if your money can go up a hundred times and you all of a sudden you're
[1:49:30.880 --> 1:49:36.080]  gonna making well shit i can pardon me i could make a million dollars no no no i hear you i hear
[1:49:36.080 --> 1:49:40.960]  you i'm not even thinking about how to but yeah but yeah the globalists are making a lot of money
[1:49:42.560 --> 1:49:48.880]  off of these engineer crises because they know how they're gonna make decisions that affect those
[1:49:48.880 --> 1:49:55.040]  prices so yes it's all about insider trading at the end of the day it's just very volatile very
[1:49:55.040 --> 1:50:02.720]  dangerous economically it's like the equivalent of nuclear war this is like crazy town susan
[1:50:02.720 --> 1:50:11.120]  in california you're on here welcome alex you are loved and thank you so much for everything
[1:50:11.120 --> 1:50:17.760]  well thank you i'm going to try to make this as simple as possible so that your listeners
[1:50:17.760 --> 1:50:26.800]  understand that when it comes to the u.s. dollar imagine a triangle at the tip of the triangle
[1:50:26.800 --> 1:50:33.920]  is the u.s. dollar at every corner there is a different currency it's rupled rupees high bought
[1:50:34.560 --> 1:50:42.960]  this is called arbitrage profit and the indirect and direct method of foreign exchange that is how
[1:50:42.960 --> 1:50:50.720]  sora the value currencies this and so i just wanted to help your listeners explain that now
[1:50:50.720 --> 1:50:58.320]  at the tip that triangle is going to be so ruble or the rupee or something else we have held that
[1:50:58.320 --> 1:51:03.600]  standard forever and that's because they got rid of the gold standard they got rid of the silver
[1:51:03.600 --> 1:51:09.120]  standard with nixon and please buy the coin i own the first edition and i plan on buying the second
[1:51:09.120 --> 1:51:14.240]  one and thank you well thank you but for those that don't know what you're explaining is if
[1:51:14.240 --> 1:51:20.160]  we're not the reserve currency we're positioned for total collapse we're deindustrialized we're
[1:51:20.160 --> 1:51:25.760]  in debt why are our own elites pushing everybody out of the dollar because they're really siding
[1:51:25.760 --> 1:51:33.760]  with china correct and china will be the new america with all the free energy thank you for the
[1:51:33.760 --> 1:51:38.000]  call thank you for the support susan really appreciate you let's go to a caller in texas
[1:51:38.000 --> 1:51:43.120]  with my grandmother's name from texas patty in texas patty you're on the air thanks for calling
[1:51:44.160 --> 1:51:48.800]  all right thanks all right thanks for picking my call welcome go ahead i'm calling i'm calling
[1:51:48.800 --> 1:51:56.960]  about um the petro dollar uh doesn't exist anymore you might as well consider it that's
[1:51:56.960 --> 1:52:03.360]  completely gone we are no longer going to be um the world reserve currency that's that's
[1:52:03.360 --> 1:52:10.240]  is gone and it's going to affect everything um in a in a horrible way just the way you had said
[1:52:10.240 --> 1:52:17.600]  it is but the other thing about this oil and the petro dollar that people have not been talking
[1:52:17.600 --> 1:52:25.680]  about is if you're going to curl for your oil which biden has been doing um it's not going to affect
[1:52:25.680 --> 1:52:33.440]  this your transportation or your heating of the car and while they're cutting off our pipelines
[1:52:33.440 --> 1:52:40.080]  and the oil drilling permits here so so again this is all by design they're literally cutting us
[1:52:40.080 --> 1:52:47.200]  off why do you think you're doing that patty um it's kind of it's going to very easily kill a
[1:52:47.200 --> 1:52:54.240]  lot more people a lot faster your your standard of living right now once you do away with oil
[1:52:54.240 --> 1:53:01.520]  people do not realize how many products you touch every single day that has oil or oil
[1:53:01.520 --> 1:53:08.800]  products or all derivatives in it um all your plastics the paint oh absolutely but remember
[1:53:08.800 --> 1:53:15.440]  india and china and russia and everybody else they still get petro chemicals they we just don't
[1:53:15.440 --> 1:53:20.080]  get it which then puts us in an even bigger disadvantage this is economic war and our
[1:53:20.080 --> 1:53:25.360]  own leaders act like they're at war with china and russia when literally they are in bed with them

[1:53:55.040 --> 1:54:00.240]  started the fight with russia to bring them in but china is the real winner for the post american
[1:54:00.240 --> 1:54:07.600]  world uh go ahead joshua alex it's a pleasure to talk to you and honestly you are honestly
[1:54:07.600 --> 1:54:14.880]  you're you're you're a blinding light for people if they don't see what's going on uh we can't
[1:54:14.880 --> 1:54:23.840]  save everyone save who we can gather them up and move forward um i'm 42 years old i'm watching my
[1:54:23.840 --> 1:54:30.640]  future go to nothing um everybody around me is so cowardice they won't stand up and say anything
[1:54:30.640 --> 1:54:36.240]  they won't scream it and then when you bring up the information to them uh like five years ago
[1:54:36.240 --> 1:54:40.640]  you brought up they're coming after the kids i told my friends this none of them believed it
[1:54:40.640 --> 1:54:45.920]  and now it's in their face every day and when you call them to tell them hey you know i tried to
[1:54:45.920 --> 1:54:50.640]  warn you guys and they're like well we won't listen to alex jones because of what he said it said
[1:54:50.640 --> 1:54:55.040]  he hooked i said you didn't listen to the full show you didn't hear what he said you've heard a
[1:54:55.040 --> 1:55:00.560]  cut up of what the media wanted you to hear and you claim you're so smart and you're not well let's
[1:55:00.560 --> 1:55:06.880]  talk about that i didn't listen i didn't lie about wmd's and iraq that that whole thing is very suspicious
[1:55:06.880 --> 1:55:12.720]  all these big events jesse smollett gulfa tonkin this newest false flag at the academy awards where
[1:55:12.720 --> 1:55:18.160]  he all braces for the slap we're supposed to question things and most stuff's fake at that level
[1:55:18.160 --> 1:55:23.520]  so it's exactly they just take that and make it about that like well ignore him you know predicting
[1:55:23.520 --> 1:55:27.680]  everything because he questioned the shooting that other people did and you don't have free speech
[1:55:27.680 --> 1:55:34.160]  in america exactly and then they go oh jones got famous off that when the people involved the lawyers
[1:55:34.160 --> 1:55:39.520]  and all of them literally live off those children and raise money off those children and then accuse
[1:55:39.520 --> 1:55:45.120]  me of living off those children when everything they say about me is them go ahead alex when you
[1:55:45.120 --> 1:55:52.800]  called 9 11 in june of 2001 when you put that number on screen and said call the white house
[1:55:52.800 --> 1:55:59.280]  call your congressman call your senators and tell them to stop this nobody wanted to listen
[1:55:59.840 --> 1:56:04.880]  and it is disgusting that we are even going to try to waste our time to save these people who are
[1:56:04.880 --> 1:56:11.040]  obviously so far gone that they will let their children be molested mentally and emotionally
[1:56:11.040 --> 1:56:16.720]  in school and not stand to stop it well you're right and i specifically on it was july 25th
[1:56:16.720 --> 1:56:20.320]  i said they're going to blow up the world trade center and blame it on bin laden that doesn't
[1:56:20.320 --> 1:56:24.640]  mean radical islam didn't exist but i could see all the telltale signs and i could just see they
[1:56:24.640 --> 1:56:28.720]  were getting ready for it absolutely well brother i mean what do you think people are going to do
[1:56:29.360 --> 1:56:35.360]  as gas is ten dollars a gallon uh and as there's no police i mean what are they going to do are
[1:56:35.360 --> 1:56:40.640]  they going to still still blame trump or me or what do you think's gonna happen i work for a small
[1:56:40.640 --> 1:56:46.560]  company that does small engine repairs and i've been filtering two-year-old gas to put in my van
[1:56:46.560 --> 1:56:51.520]  so that i could afford to put food in my table and still get back and forth to work what i don't
[1:56:51.520 --> 1:56:55.840]  know what these people are going to do when they max out their credit cards because that's what it
[1:56:55.840 --> 1:57:00.880]  seems to be all these people in jersey and new york living on their credit cards when they max out
[1:57:00.880 --> 1:57:05.280]  their credit cards and there's no more and they can't afford the gas and diesel anymore they're
[1:57:05.280 --> 1:57:09.760]  screwed they don't know you said it i i remember during the lockdown a year and a half ago i went

[1:59:49.520 --> 2:00:17.360]  assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones let's go right back to your phone
[2:00:17.360 --> 2:00:21.280]  calls here on the alex jones show ahead of dr sherry tim penny joining us and i'll go back
[2:00:21.280 --> 2:00:28.960]  to your phone calls josh in florida welcome hey how are we doing alex so i have a slight
[2:00:28.960 --> 2:00:35.280]  disagreement with um some of the people on the the right the analysis about food and they either
[2:00:35.280 --> 2:00:42.320]  think he's fighting a holy war before he walks into a trap now here's how i see it going with step one
[2:00:42.320 --> 2:00:49.760]  one war is step two now we're going to have a cyber blackout where the only information we
[2:00:49.760 --> 2:00:56.880]  could get is the news and i see them telling people that it's going to be nuclear armageddon
[2:00:57.680 --> 2:01:04.080]  say goodbye to your families and not the 11th hour magically everybody's going to come together
[2:01:04.720 --> 2:01:10.400]  and rewrite the world just like they did after world war two and we're going to have that digital
[2:01:10.400 --> 2:01:20.560]  currency ubi off floating maybe through the imf but this is all part of the game part of the plan
[2:01:20.560 --> 2:01:28.880]  where we're going to see russia china india and the ua e split up the world just like 1984 after
[2:01:28.880 --> 2:01:37.040]  world war two it was the us and europe and now it's going to be us and europe they're going to take
[2:01:37.040 --> 2:01:43.760]  the backseat you're going to have russia china ua e india and the only news we're going to be able
[2:01:43.760 --> 2:01:51.840]  to get when the internet goes out is from the tv so how do you get the whole world to sign on if
[2:01:51.840 --> 2:01:55.680]  everybody's saying goodbye to their families thinking they're going to die from your war
[2:01:56.560 --> 2:02:02.400]  and then magically at the 11th hour they're going to come together we're going to have a new internet
[2:02:02.400 --> 2:02:09.440]  new currency and new borders well that's definitely what they've announced the process they want
[2:02:09.440 --> 2:02:15.840]  that's right it's all being maneuvered towards that yeah so the people out there thinking russia
[2:02:16.560 --> 2:02:23.280]  and Putin walking to a trap or he's fighting some holy war is a joke this is all to bring
[2:02:23.840 --> 2:02:29.440]  china and russia to the table we're going to see this go on you're going to see your gas prices at
[2:02:29.440 --> 2:02:40.320]  7 at 10 no food then the internet's going to go no communication only your tv news and i could see
[2:02:40.320 --> 2:02:47.760]  them being like say goodbye to your families it's all over and then magically at the final hour
[2:02:48.640 --> 2:02:57.360]  we have a new world order and that's my analysis for 20 years of looking at these people i agree
[2:02:57.360 --> 2:03:00.880]  no they admit they're creating the build back better they have to collapse society to do it
[2:03:00.880 --> 2:03:05.760]  and they're orchestrating every facet of it josh amazing points thank you so much for calling wow

[2:04:05.040 --> 2:04:13.920]  and so they um basically took control of macraw hill carry macraw wound up um sitting in a corner
[2:04:13.920 --> 2:04:21.360]  office um with no power whatsoever and he wound up having to leave with 3.2 billion dollars of

[2:06:43.760 --> 2:06:51.120]  b us y dr t and she's with us because i wanted to ask her about the next phase of the globalist
[2:06:51.120 --> 2:06:57.120]  agenda she was able to accurately predict what was coming lay out what's happened and then now
[2:06:57.120 --> 2:07:03.120]  they want to move to war and devaluation and end of the dollar but what's the next phase of covid and
[2:07:03.120 --> 2:07:07.360]  what are the numbers we see because i've got a bunch of articles here but it's on the sides of

[2:08:04.320 --> 2:08:09.920]  own research so dr great to have you here i mean wherever you want to start uh you haven't been on
[2:08:09.920 --> 2:08:16.160]  probably six eight months what's happened where we're going where should we begin well alex thank
[2:08:16.160 --> 2:08:20.000]  you so much again for having me on it has been a little while but you know time is so compressed
[2:08:20.000 --> 2:08:26.800]  these days it just all blows together it seems like um every day is a week it just goes by
[2:08:26.800 --> 2:08:33.440]  things just like blur by so um to your original conversation or your your opening remark when
[2:08:33.440 --> 2:08:39.760]  you said where are we going next well i feel like this is just like the the calm before the storm
[2:08:39.760 --> 2:08:44.560]  they really have just allowed people to take the get the boot off their neck and off the back of
[2:08:44.560 --> 2:08:49.920]  their heads here for a little while and you know when everything was falling apart with covet i mean
[2:08:49.920 --> 2:08:54.800]  we had the truckers in canada the truckers in the us and all the people around the world revolting
[2:08:54.800 --> 2:08:59.920]  against these kobe passes and these mandate and these mandates everything was falling apart more
[2:08:59.920 --> 2:09:04.640]  and more people were saying no people were just ignoring the authorities and just like going on
[2:09:04.640 --> 2:09:10.240]  about their business and then we get a war it's what's like well look at that you know look over
[2:09:10.240 --> 2:09:14.960]  there look over there because um you know this isn't working anymore now we need another distraction
[2:09:15.840 --> 2:09:20.560]  and all the people who learned to distrust the media and didn't trust anything fouchy or anybody
[2:09:20.560 --> 2:09:25.680]  else said now they're all sucked back into believing everything that they say about this war it just
[2:09:25.680 --> 2:09:31.360]  is a mindset of american people and the people across the world just never ceases to amaze me
[2:09:31.360 --> 2:09:37.280]  how they are so easily misled and my big concern now is that they're going to be releasing something
[2:09:37.280 --> 2:09:43.600]  new and i believe that they're threatening hemorrhagic fever viruses so we've already heard
[2:09:43.600 --> 2:09:49.600]  whispers of this in the uk um and that the you know they'll have hemorrhagic fever fever viruses
[2:09:49.600 --> 2:09:55.440]  which go into ebola and that whole family of viruses you know alex i'm not sure if i mentioned
[2:09:55.440 --> 2:10:02.640]  this to you the last time we spoke but in february of 2020 i was um i went to the cdc because there
[2:10:02.640 --> 2:10:08.080]  was an asap meeting the advisory committee of immunization practices meets three times a year
[2:10:08.080 --> 2:10:13.840]  and there was an asap meeting that was happening right before um right or right as this covid stuff
[2:10:13.840 --> 2:10:19.280]  was starting to break out i thought was surely they're going to be talking about kova coronaviruses
[2:10:19.280 --> 2:10:26.320]  what they think is going to be happening so i went down to the to atlanta i went to the cdc this was
[2:10:26.320 --> 2:10:33.600]  around february 27th or 28th of 2020 but what were they talking about they were talking about passing
[2:10:34.720 --> 2:10:41.360]  and approving a new vaccine for ebola the entire day and a half that i was there was talking about
[2:10:41.360 --> 2:10:46.480]  the ebola vaccine and i was like why are they talking about this with all the stuff coming out
[2:10:46.480 --> 2:10:51.840]  with the coronaviruses and during the course of that meeting not only did they approve it for use
[2:10:51.840 --> 2:10:57.280]  in people in high-risk situations like working in labs or going to the congo and dealing working
[2:10:57.280 --> 2:11:04.400]  with people that have been infected with this virus over lunch over lunch they just decided
[2:11:04.400 --> 2:11:11.200]  that they would give this live virus vaccine to pregnant women and then they quietly passed it a
[2:11:11.200 --> 2:11:16.880]  few months later making an approval for everyone so as they bring out these hemorrhagic fevers and
[2:11:16.880 --> 2:11:21.440]  if they were able to bring the entire world to their knees over watching a few people pass out
[2:11:21.440 --> 2:11:27.040]  and we don't even know what they passed out from from and make everybody so afraid of the coronaviruses
[2:11:27.040 --> 2:11:32.400]  all they're going to have to do is show a few stock images of people bleeding from their eyes or
[2:11:32.400 --> 2:11:36.720]  having other sort of hemorrhagic type of problems where they'll be able to bring the people to their
[2:11:36.720 --> 2:11:42.000]  knees again and say well guess what we've already got this Ebola vaccine and it's already been approved
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:46.960]  now here's my conjecture Alex and this i don't have any proof of this this is just Dr. Tenpenny's
[2:11:46.960 --> 2:11:54.000]  just supposition of how they're going to roll this out is that they'll say we've got this really
[2:11:54.000 --> 2:11:59.040]  deadly horrible hemorrhagic virus that's going to come out that'll make people bleed to death
[2:11:59.040 --> 2:12:03.920]  and they're going to it's going to be horrifying but we have a vaccine already ready for you
[2:12:03.920 --> 2:12:08.640]  but it's in very short supply and we're only going to give it to those who've been vaccinated with
[2:12:08.640 --> 2:12:14.720]  the covid shot because what they really want is the whole world injected with this covid shot
[2:12:14.720 --> 2:12:19.920]  with the nanobot technology and the bluetooth association with it and everything to do with
[2:12:19.920 --> 2:12:24.800]  the transhumanism movement that's what they really want and so it's just in my opinion
[2:12:24.800 --> 2:12:29.440]  i could be totally wrong about this but i think that's how they're going to push more people
[2:12:29.440 --> 2:12:34.720]  into getting the covid shot is by threatening hemorrhagic fever and saying we've got a shot
[2:12:34.720 --> 2:12:41.200]  but um you can't have it unless you've had your covid shot i'm at a film in 2007 called in-game
[2:12:41.760 --> 2:12:45.680]  blueprint for global enslavement and i quote all these globalist biologists saying we're
[2:12:45.680 --> 2:12:50.160]  going to use airborne Ebola to depopulate earth and the head of the ut biology department dr
[2:12:50.160 --> 2:12:55.840]  eric pionka said i know i'll be dead soon but it's best for earth the airborne Ebola they they
[2:12:55.840 --> 2:13:03.040]  tend to be obsessed with that well they're obsessed with anything that's going to lead to the depopulation
[2:13:03.040 --> 2:13:07.120]  of the planet you know alex i go back the 20 years that we've been talking to each other
[2:13:07.120 --> 2:13:13.280]  at various times about this and how you were labeled such a crazy conspiracy theory tinfoil
[2:13:13.280 --> 2:13:19.440]  hat guy and you've been wrong you've been right all along about prison planet and an info war is
[2:13:19.440 --> 2:13:24.800]  the war for your mind because now we're past the war for our minds they've got our minds
[2:13:24.800 --> 2:13:31.200]  now what we're struggling with is the war for our souls because what we are doing have allowed them
[2:13:31.200 --> 2:13:37.600]  to do is intentionally inject messenger RNA and double-stranded DNA into our body that it appears
[2:13:37.600 --> 2:13:43.120]  as though that's going to replicate forever it's going to destroy our genetics destroy our immune
[2:13:43.120 --> 2:13:48.080]  system it's going to kill millions of people maybe billions which is what they would like
[2:13:48.080 --> 2:13:52.320]  according to the georgia guide stones and according to all the depopulation things that
[2:13:52.320 --> 2:13:57.040]  they talk about and they want to depopulate the planet and those that are left will be chronically
[2:13:57.040 --> 2:14:02.720]  sick which will feed the pharmaceutical industry or they will be transhumanoid and will be part of
[2:14:02.720 --> 2:14:09.360]  the of the transhumanism movement the electronics of the internet of things and the the the social
[2:14:09.360 --> 2:14:15.920]  credit score system that will just control every area of our lives wow absolutely and and they're
[2:14:15.920 --> 2:14:21.280]  here and as you warned years ago and dr yedan did this spike protein that the vaccine creates
[2:14:21.280 --> 2:14:27.600]  never goes away it's eating our bodies cutting the dna double helix this is just this is it this
[2:14:27.600 --> 2:14:35.520]  is it this has been what uh you know the satanists have the satanists and luciferians have wanted
[2:14:35.520 --> 2:14:42.560]  since the garden of eden you know when when god cursed the the serpent and said that you will
[2:14:42.560 --> 2:14:48.400]  bite at her heels but she will strike at your head and then as we went past the when we went
[2:14:48.400 --> 2:14:53.520]  through the noa flood and we ended we descended down through noa through his son ham and then
[2:14:53.520 --> 2:14:59.840]  kush and then nimrod and the rise of the babelonian mystery schools and the child sacrifice and all
[2:14:59.840 --> 2:15:05.840]  of the evil things that were happening through human trafficking and child sacrifice and burning
[2:15:05.840 --> 2:15:11.440]  children alive after massive orgies that were happening in those days and the bible says you
[2:15:11.440 --> 2:15:17.760]  know as in the days of noa which really meant why they destroyed the world but his son his grandson
[2:15:17.760 --> 2:15:22.320]  nimrod was the resurrection of the babelonia mysteries mystery schools and he was responsible
[2:15:22.320 --> 2:15:28.080]  for the tower of babel and the quantum the quantum computers and what we're having now with the
[2:15:28.080 --> 2:15:34.880]  artificial intelligence is like the modern day tower of babel it will bring about the destruction
[2:15:34.880 --> 2:15:41.360]  of humanity just like the tower of babel did um at the period of time when it was built by by nimrod
[2:15:41.360 --> 2:15:47.360]  in the babelonian mystery schools well dr timpani you've always been informative but you are

[2:20:24.800 --> 2:20:40.720]  so
[2:20:41.840 --> 2:20:48.640]  as pro-humans we don't like to uh be victims but we're not victims are gonna live as victims
[2:20:48.640 --> 2:20:56.720]  were overcomers but we have been victimized and everyone in the world in the last 25 26 months
[2:20:56.720 --> 2:21:02.560]  has been the victim of a bio weapon attack and has been a now a victim of a poisoned gmo
[2:21:03.200 --> 2:21:08.160]  gene therapy injection that destroys the double helix of your dna cuts right through both of them
[2:21:08.160 --> 2:21:14.560]  that's on record now and so analyzing this i asked the question of dr. jen penny a year ago and others
[2:21:14.560 --> 2:21:19.040]  in the last two years how do they get away with launching a bio attack like this well the answer
[2:21:19.040 --> 2:21:25.520]  is war economic collapse we harped on that and here we are so you already know tomorrow's news today
[2:21:26.320 --> 2:21:33.360]  let's now talk about what's coming next dr. ten penny well i think that what we've already talked
[2:21:33.360 --> 2:21:38.560]  about a little bit alex is the release of these hemorrhagic viruses but i think that what's really
[2:21:38.560 --> 2:21:45.600]  important is for people to to understand the horizon i mean where are you in your personal
[2:21:45.600 --> 2:21:51.200]  life in terms of preparing for what might come you know they're talking about setting up this
[2:21:51.200 --> 2:21:56.560]  treaty the united nations is live has already passed the first part of the general assembly of nine
[2:21:56.560 --> 2:22:03.120]  of 194 countries signing on to this international treaty to protect against future biological
[2:22:03.120 --> 2:22:08.800]  warfare which if this goes through they will have well they will have kobe passes for everybody
[2:22:08.800 --> 2:22:13.520]  they will have mandatory vaccines for everybody which will be a hook to your qr code and you
[2:22:13.520 --> 2:22:18.800]  won't be able to do much without it it will you'll barely be able to get food gasoline and all these
[2:22:18.800 --> 2:22:24.160]  things and so stopping this treaty that they're trying to get past at the united nations to hand
[2:22:24.160 --> 2:22:29.520]  over all the sovereignty governments of the world over to the world health organization is really
[2:22:29.520 --> 2:22:33.280]  a travesty and you that's right tell folks about that treaty i've mentioned that we should spend
[2:22:33.280 --> 2:22:37.360]  more time on it there is a treaty right now for all governments to give their authority
[2:22:37.360 --> 2:22:44.640]  an emergency to the un yes and and the un and the world health organization because they're
[2:22:44.640 --> 2:22:50.480]  doing this to keep everyone safe from the next pandemic because we know there's going to be more
[2:22:50.480 --> 2:22:55.680]  of them of course there's going to be more they got the playbook written now and now that they
[2:22:55.680 --> 2:23:02.640]  have written the playbook and everybody fell in line and all masked up and social distanced and
[2:23:02.640 --> 2:23:07.760]  got their q-tips up their nose and got tested repeatedly over and over and over again and many
[2:23:07.760 --> 2:23:13.760]  of people have gotten this injection gotten this gene therapy gene altering life altering
[2:23:13.760 --> 2:23:18.640]  i'm shot that has thousands and thousands of people that have died and millions of people
[2:23:18.640 --> 2:23:23.520]  that have become chronically sick um you know they just all kind of rolled over and did it
[2:23:23.520 --> 2:23:28.080]  so now that they've got everybody in the position of where they are they're going to do it again
[2:23:28.080 --> 2:23:34.240]  and again and again and if this treaty passes them for those that don't really understand treaties
[2:23:34.240 --> 2:23:41.440]  i mean treaties supersede um individual government law so if the u.s has a treaty with um any other
[2:23:41.440 --> 2:23:46.720]  country in the world the the things that they sign on to and pass by two-thirds of our congress
[2:23:46.720 --> 2:23:50.880]  they are supposedly have to pass using our congress and again doc you had that in front of
[2:23:50.880 --> 2:23:54.640]  me because i saw the un treaty a month ago i covered it once or twice but i don't have the name
[2:23:54.640 --> 2:23:59.840]  of it what what's the particular we need to put that on screen so folks know how real this is um
[2:23:59.840 --> 2:24:06.400]  gosh let me i'll have to look for it there it is who quietly pushes for global pandemic treaty
[2:24:06.400 --> 2:24:11.520]  the big of organization uh precedence over participating nations during pandemics print
[2:24:11.520 --> 2:24:14.560]  it we'll have it next segment i just want to give people the actual treaty because it's so
[2:24:14.560 --> 2:24:20.480]  incredible please continue okay so what's really important for for this is that it's understanding
[2:24:20.480 --> 2:24:27.280]  that treaty law supersedes our constitution it supersedes our government law supersedes
[2:24:27.280 --> 2:24:34.560]  our trade law that treaties are are the highest law of the global world so if this gets passed
[2:24:34.560 --> 2:24:40.240]  and all 194 countries sign on i mean it'll be one of these situations alex where you can run but
[2:24:40.240 --> 2:24:45.120]  you cannot hide because through the world economic forum and through what they have done through the
[2:24:45.120 --> 2:24:49.840]  young globalist committees and the young globalist forum that they've brought in all of the people
[2:24:49.840 --> 2:24:56.160]  from the world governments high levels of of major multinational companies even down to state and
[2:24:56.160 --> 2:25:02.160]  local governments you know you can cut off the head of the hydra but the the tentacles have run
[2:25:02.160 --> 2:25:07.760]  everywhere and so it's really important for people to be aware of this treaty and not only be
[2:25:08.480 --> 2:25:13.840]  looking for what's ways that we can stop this at our state and local government get our sheriffs
[2:25:13.840 --> 2:25:18.800]  involved to protect your particular county to protect where you live but also to do some
[2:25:18.800 --> 2:25:23.200]  preparation and some planning which is kind of what we're doing we have put together for us we
[2:25:23.200 --> 2:25:27.920]  did a big survey of all of our former students and all of our email database and our social
[2:25:27.920 --> 2:25:33.520]  media people and and said what do you want us to do what would you like for us to present for you
[2:25:33.520 --> 2:25:38.800]  in our next boot camp because our boot camps have previously been about vaccine things and by the way
[2:25:38.800 --> 2:25:43.120]  i didn't even know your next boot camp was this but i'm like look she's got to come on about what's
[2:25:43.120 --> 2:25:47.440]  coming next and what she predicts next and how we get ready then it turns out that's exactly what
[2:25:47.440 --> 2:25:53.280]  your boot camp is because i'm getting that same question from everybody yeah it's a preparation
[2:25:53.280 --> 2:25:57.120]  and what's interesting is our past boot camps we always do two boot camps a year one in the spring
[2:25:57.120 --> 2:26:03.840]  one in the fall you know 17 18 19 we're in we're all about vaccine things 20 and 21 was all about
[2:26:03.840 --> 2:26:10.240]  covid related stuff so we did a big survey of our database and we said what are you most interested
[2:26:10.240 --> 2:26:15.280]  in if we could do anything for you what would that be and the number one thing that they that they
[2:26:15.280 --> 2:26:21.200]  asked for was a a course on prepping that would all be in one place so this is a four week online
[2:26:21.200 --> 2:26:26.880]  course it is not us centric it's for anybody in the world that can actually do can take this course

[2:33:13.840 --> 2:33:20.480]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones coming to you live from the
[2:33:20.480 --> 2:33:27.600]  front lines of the info war all right we pulled up some articles we have links to the un and
[2:33:27.600 --> 2:33:31.920]  the treaty it's the world pandemic treaty your government signed over their authority ahead
[2:33:31.920 --> 2:33:36.880]  of time here's an info wars article that links right to it the second link world council for
[2:33:36.880 --> 2:33:42.800]  health slams who's pandemic treaty threat to sovereignty and inalable rights got a bunch
[2:33:42.800 --> 2:33:48.400]  of other news articles uh different publications who quietly pushes for global pandemic treaty
[2:33:48.400 --> 2:33:53.760]  that would give organization precedence over participating nations during pandemics and it
[2:33:53.760 --> 2:33:58.800]  just goes on from there with links to the un website so you can see that for yourself incredible
[2:33:58.800 --> 2:34:07.040]  so dr sherry tin penny you know i see their global power grab as having some success for the world
[2:34:07.040 --> 2:34:12.160]  id world social credit score their apps we can see it all rolled out oh you don't get menus you get
[2:34:12.160 --> 2:34:17.680]  qr codes and oh now that's the maxi passport but then i see major pushback as a victory so they
[2:34:17.680 --> 2:34:21.920]  pull it off the table and say okay you're winning so we go back to sleep and i agree they're about
[2:34:21.920 --> 2:34:26.240]  to come right back with it we've seen leaked documents out of canada the uk and new york
[2:34:26.240 --> 2:34:31.360]  city saying after the election they're bringing it back but you were earlier kind of saying we got
[2:34:31.360 --> 2:34:38.800]  defeated by this or the test passed we submitted so they're going to do it again i'm on the fence i
[2:34:38.800 --> 2:34:46.160]  mean if this was given a credit card or a report card for the globalist on how they did with this
[2:34:46.160 --> 2:34:51.520]  power grab would you give them an a and f of b what do you think really happened i think you
[2:34:51.520 --> 2:34:57.280]  would have to subcategorize that alex you know in terms of if you were going to give them a grade
[2:34:57.280 --> 2:35:06.400]  i mean if you if you gave them a grade on how successful their messaging was with the fear
[2:35:06.400 --> 2:35:13.680]  based messaging to get everyone coward in the corner i would give them an a triple plus if
[2:35:13.680 --> 2:35:19.760]  but with their follow through i believe that they thought that they had it all wrapped up bar none
[2:35:19.760 --> 2:35:23.840]  and in fact if you went to the world economic forum and you went through that really fancy
[2:35:23.840 --> 2:35:29.200]  complex website that they have with all the different data points that are connected together
[2:35:29.200 --> 2:35:34.400]  they absolutely don't have any plan backup plan for failure so they were so sure that they had won
[2:35:34.400 --> 2:35:40.880]  this and and i also believe that that they are so far removed from the liberty seeking people and
[2:35:40.880 --> 2:35:46.000]  the freedom loving people and the god people on this planet they're so far removed from that
[2:35:46.000 --> 2:35:51.840]  that they really had no anticipation of the level of blowback that they were going to receive i mean
[2:35:51.840 --> 2:35:56.160]  i think that the things that happened all the marches all the different things that were happening
[2:35:56.160 --> 2:36:02.080]  in europe the the truckers and the various different people that revolted to this i think
[2:36:02.080 --> 2:36:07.600]  that they were really surprised by that and it was and and the and they didn't have a backup plan
[2:36:07.600 --> 2:36:13.200]  and so i totally agree so their front end assault and their coordination of lies was was very well
[2:36:13.200 --> 2:36:18.960]  done but just like hitler starting world war two later they got bogged down in the mud humanities
[2:36:18.960 --> 2:36:23.840]  rising against them really scared that it made them pull back but they're clearly about to strike
[2:36:23.840 --> 2:36:30.960]  again oh absolutely i mean think about it alex when they they've done they did sars and they did
[2:36:30.960 --> 2:36:38.480]  mers and then they did h1n1 and they did bird flu in 2005 and i wrote a book during that time in real
[2:36:38.480 --> 2:36:43.360]  time about bird flu and at that time i was also going to washington dc about every six week to
[2:36:43.360 --> 2:36:48.160]  go to their pandemic planning committee meetings and seeing what they were setting up and at that
[2:36:48.160 --> 2:36:53.040]  point in time the world health organization released this elaborate plan on all the different
[2:36:53.040 --> 2:36:59.040]  levels the color coded levels of to announce when pandemics were happening and then that that was
[2:36:59.040 --> 2:37:05.120]  like setting the like the the skeleton the infrastructure and then they did in 2009 then
[2:37:05.120 --> 2:37:10.640]  they did h1n1 and then they put the vaccines out fast and furious and they saw how many
[2:37:10.640 --> 2:37:15.840]  people were willing to accept it so when they did this the coronavirus is the first time ever
[2:37:15.840 --> 2:37:21.440]  that they were able to pull the entire world every country in the world to their knees at
[2:37:21.440 --> 2:37:28.080]  essentially the same time and at the beginning of it they didn't get much blowback and i think
[2:37:28.080 --> 2:37:33.360]  that they sat back and went wow look at this we are a lot further down the pathway to total tyranny
[2:37:33.360 --> 2:37:39.840]  than when we thought hammer down and they did and so now when we've had some level of what we the
[2:37:39.840 --> 2:37:46.480]  patriots would call um success in terms of blowback against like fauci that you have up here in the
[2:37:46.480 --> 2:37:51.920]  screen and blowback that we've had against like uh like trudeau and with some of the things that
[2:37:51.920 --> 2:37:57.040]  have happened in the europe i think that they give us it's it's how tyranny works alex you know i mean
[2:37:57.040 --> 2:38:02.560]  they crush you then they come off on the gas a little bit then they crush you again because it's
[2:38:02.560 --> 2:38:07.120]  like the you know the stock home syndrome oh it looks like we're winning we must be doing the
[2:38:07.120 --> 2:38:12.000]  right things for our masters to stop crushing our head and it's just giving us a little breath
[2:38:12.000 --> 2:38:16.560]  before they go forward with the next thing this treaty i want to go back to this treaty a little
[2:38:16.560 --> 2:38:21.360]  bit and what this actually says because i think it's really important for people to know it's the
[2:38:21.360 --> 2:38:26.960]  it's like you said it's called the international pandemic treaty and it says in the first
[2:38:26.960 --> 2:38:33.520]  sentence of this it says on march 3rd 2020 the council adopted a decision to authorize
[2:38:33.520 --> 2:38:39.120]  the opening for negotiations of an international agreement on pandemic prevention preparedness
[2:38:39.120 --> 2:38:43.680]  and response response is the key word there and for radio listeners we have it on screen
[2:38:43.680 --> 2:38:49.360]  from the un there it is right and for the international negotiating body that they
[2:38:49.360 --> 2:38:53.760]  will hold it's they they gave the green light to go ahead and start planning this that they
[2:38:53.760 --> 2:39:02.240]  will be discussing it in august of 2022 with the aim to adopt the full treaty by by 2024
[2:39:02.240 --> 2:39:06.960]  and let me stop you let me stop you because what you said is so critical earlier you're a medical
[2:39:06.960 --> 2:39:11.840]  doctor you're a researcher you're you publish things you're smart you go to meetings you see
[2:39:11.840 --> 2:39:18.720]  them preparing this big disease acts salivating for their power grab all the propaganda it's clear
[2:39:18.720 --> 2:39:22.960]  operation lockstep rockefeller foundation they're going to do this they say they're going to use
[2:39:22.960 --> 2:39:28.480]  this for global government it's not it's not our opinion and and so everything is bent towards this
[2:39:28.480 --> 2:39:33.200]  you're saying we just saw a beta test they won some they lost some but now they're going to come
[2:39:33.200 --> 2:39:38.800]  back with their new knowledge from their live action war game to hit us with something way way
[2:39:38.800 --> 2:39:44.880]  worse yes and it's exactly you said the word exactly right alex it's a beta test it's just
[2:39:44.880 --> 2:39:50.400]  like any other marketing thing you do with a new product you put it out there see the response and
[2:39:50.400 --> 2:39:55.600]  then you fall back and analyze so they put it out there they've watched the response now they're
[2:39:55.600 --> 2:40:00.160]  going to take a little break and fall back and analyze and they're going to look for what holes
[2:40:00.160 --> 2:40:07.200]  do we need to plug so we don't have these little plebe uh sheep revolting again you know we left
[2:40:07.200 --> 2:40:12.400]  some doors open that we didn't know that we're there they've pointed us out pointed out to us
[2:40:12.400 --> 2:40:16.080]  that we're how they're going to revolt how they're going to communicate how they're going to get
[2:40:16.080 --> 2:40:20.640]  together how they're going to organize we need to pull back and make sure we close all those doors
[2:40:20.640 --> 2:40:28.080]  so they can't do that again i mean it's that's just what they what a market test is and you know
[2:40:28.080 --> 2:40:32.240]  there was a quote from claus schwaab just the other day who was saying you know we've got to get rid
[2:40:32.240 --> 2:40:36.480]  of the internet because the internet there's just too much yeah i'm saying point blank we got our
[2:40:36.480 --> 2:40:41.440]  ass kicked by this information no you got your ass kicked despite censorship by humanity just
[2:40:41.440 --> 2:40:47.440]  overriding you so the message is find other holes attack peacefully on other fronts and and keep
[2:40:47.440 --> 2:40:52.320]  exposing them now during this period of them wanting us to go back to sleep that's the most
[2:40:52.320 --> 2:40:57.520]  important thing is attack now more than ever we have them on their heels in retreat don't stop
[2:40:57.520 --> 2:41:04.160]  now that they're in retreat expose them as war criminals violating the nirnberg code absolutely
[2:41:04.160 --> 2:41:09.280]  and you said it absolutely right i mean every time they let off on the gas a little bit it's time
[2:41:09.280 --> 2:41:15.120]  for us to power down and go even for even expose it even that's right the fight with somebody that
[2:41:15.120 --> 2:41:18.960]  starts the fight when you get a hit in and get them dizzy they're going to come back at you
[2:41:18.960 --> 2:41:23.040]  they started the fight now that's when you go in and drive them down that's when you make the main
[2:41:23.040 --> 2:41:28.800]  move and that's what we need to be doing now we need to plan and prepare individually and that's
[2:41:28.800 --> 2:41:34.720]  what our our course is about you know at learning4u.org forward slash survive plan individually
[2:41:34.720 --> 2:41:40.000]  and then collectively get with your community and like we both alluded to your family members
[2:41:40.000 --> 2:41:44.480]  may not be the ones that you can trust i mean think about back in nazi germany it was your
[2:41:44.480 --> 2:41:48.480]  family family members that turned in family members for not doing what they were supposed
[2:41:48.480 --> 2:41:53.840]  to do in terms of the nazi movement you know can you really trust your family and just because
[2:41:53.840 --> 2:41:59.600]  someone is is biologically related to you through blood it doesn't necessarily mean that they are
[2:41:59.600 --> 2:42:05.520]  your tribe when things start to fall apart you need like-minded people that are spiritually on
[2:42:05.520 --> 2:42:10.960]  the same battle with you physically on the same battle with you and and can rally the troops
[2:42:10.960 --> 2:42:16.160]  and get together when the going gets tough because it most likely will be happening sooner rather
[2:42:16.160 --> 2:42:19.920]  than later i'll see five more minutes to the other side i'm gonna let you go but what you say is so
[2:42:19.920 --> 2:42:26.880]  critical spiritual connection is the real tribe blood is important but don't override people that
[2:42:26.880 --> 2:42:33.600]  you're spiritually connected to more than uh blood because they they they literally use that
[2:42:33.600 --> 2:42:39.440]  against us what matters is spiritual kinship even about blood that's a very important point i'm glad
[2:42:39.440 --> 2:42:43.840]  you hone in on that a lot of our families are great but at the same time we can't go down
[2:42:43.840 --> 2:42:56.880]  with the ship just because some of our families aren't awake we're right back stay with us in
[2:42:56.880 --> 2:43:05.840]  december of 2021 info wars offered the first in a three-part series the 1776 anti-tyrant coin
[2:43:05.840 --> 2:43:12.480]  and it sold out in 10 days and if it wasn't for listeners getting this original powerful coin a
[2:43:12.480 --> 2:43:19.680]  founding member coin we would not be on air today now the second coin the liberty tree coin
[2:43:19.680 --> 2:43:25.360]  is being offered and it will probably sell out in 10 days again it certainly needs to the front of
[2:43:25.360 --> 2:43:31.360]  operation it is so historic and it has a quote from thomas jefferson about the tree of liberty
[2:43:31.360 --> 2:43:36.640]  being refreshed with the blood of patriots and tyrants and more see the coin for yourself at
[2:43:36.640 --> 2:43:44.000]  1776 coin dot com it's also an info or store dot com it's amazing there's only 10 000 of them
[2:43:44.000 --> 2:43:49.520]  and as a founding member if we're able to stay on the air we're planning something very very special
[2:43:49.520 --> 2:43:53.920]  for everyone that helps us go to the next level so get your new tree of liberty coin while you

[2:44:59.840 --> 2:45:09.840]  just one word the brainwashing the mind control the asleep prince that the general public is in
[2:45:09.840 --> 2:45:16.960]  the best word would actually be the people are lost just like you're lost to sleep or lost in a
[2:45:17.760 --> 2:45:23.040]  bad nightmare or you're in a horror you get knocked out and you've lost your bearings because
[2:45:24.240 --> 2:45:30.240]  you are totally dizzy and confused you have a concussion and that's what the globalists have
[2:45:30.240 --> 2:45:36.000]  done they have stunned us they have put us into a position of not knowing our bearings and then
[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:40.720]  claus wab recently came out and gave speech called the great new narrative where he brags how the
[2:45:40.720 --> 2:45:46.560]  public is lost how the culture in the media has been driven to make sure the people are all alone
[2:45:46.560 --> 2:45:51.600]  so they can now guide humanity over the edge of a cliff that's what the great reset is they need
[2:45:51.600 --> 2:46:00.560]  darkness to thrive the light lives at info wars dot com ladies and gentlemen infowarstore.com is
[2:46:00.560 --> 2:46:08.720]  offering the biggest sales in its over 20 year history and that is because the economy is breaking
[2:46:08.720 --> 2:46:15.200]  down inflation is exploding the supply chains have broken down and info wars is having serious
[2:46:15.200 --> 2:46:20.640]  trouble making its payroll and paying for operations and i do not want to implode or downsize
[2:46:20.640 --> 2:46:25.760]  in the face of the globalists making their main move info wars its paradoxical is more popular
[2:46:25.760 --> 2:46:31.200]  than ever it is reaching more people than ever despite the censorship but because of cost increasing
[2:46:31.200 --> 2:46:35.680]  and having to run our own infrastructure to pay for our own ban with everything else we are running
[2:46:35.680 --> 2:46:42.800]  out of money so listen up to 75 percent off info works for dot com on things like amazing patriot
[2:46:42.800 --> 2:46:48.640]  t-shirts that helps spread the word and fund the operation on supplements on books on films
[2:46:48.640 --> 2:46:54.000]  everything is 25 to 75 percent off right now the biggest sell in our history at info wars
[2:46:54.000 --> 2:47:01.760]  store dot com thank you for your support leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world
[2:47:01.760 --> 2:47:20.320]  order it's alex jones well i was talking to dr sherry timpani during the break it's like i love
[2:47:20.320 --> 2:47:25.920]  bandot video we watch it all i'm like well then you need a channel on there it's free we're gonna
[2:47:25.920 --> 2:47:30.960]  get her hooked up on bandot video for her podcast and great shows and what she does i'm alex jones
[2:47:30.960 --> 2:47:35.120]  your host we get calls coming up i'm gonna host some of the next hour i'm gonna host the whole
[2:47:35.120 --> 2:47:39.600]  next hour take your calls other guests are gonna be in studio with us but dr sherry timpani i was
[2:47:39.600 --> 2:47:44.720]  asking you what's most important you said man that's the big question and i'm the same way i mean
[2:47:44.720 --> 2:47:49.840]  we need to know that the next assaults coming they're killing the dollar we're in the new world
[2:47:49.840 --> 2:47:55.920]  order now but that's okay we're gonna be leaders in this and god is stronger than the devil i think
[2:47:55.920 --> 2:48:02.800]  it's what you're saying and so just just get ready well you know alex the last two years has been
[2:48:02.800 --> 2:48:08.640]  you know covet saturated right i mean i did over 600 interviews in 18 months and to put that in
[2:48:08.640 --> 2:48:13.680]  context for your listeners i usually do about 30 a year usually do you know a couple of month and i
[2:48:13.680 --> 2:48:18.240]  did some days i was doing six and seven interviews in the same day just to like carpet bomb the
[2:48:18.240 --> 2:48:23.520]  neighborhood to get people to try try to get as many people as possible to not take this shot
[2:48:23.520 --> 2:48:28.080]  and by the way i want to thank you because i know you you gave them hell you got targeted by the
[2:48:28.080 --> 2:48:32.160]  new or you got singled out i want to thank you because i know it's hard to do that on top of
[2:48:32.160 --> 2:48:36.960]  all you do thank you for being such a warrior i want everybody to know i saw what you did you
[2:48:36.960 --> 2:48:43.920]  have really beyond pulled your way just as much as dr yedon uh or or any of the top people fighting
[2:48:43.920 --> 2:48:49.120]  you have been the top of the spear well thank you so much for that alex i appreciate it it was
[2:48:49.120 --> 2:48:53.440]  just what god told me to do it's like carpet bomb the neighborhood with the truth and so
[2:48:53.440 --> 2:48:58.080]  this year the talk that i've been giving has been called the intentional destruction of the
[2:48:58.080 --> 2:49:03.520]  temple that we have people have volunteered to take this shot and have destroyed the temple of the
[2:49:03.520 --> 2:49:09.920]  holy spirit which is where god lives and so to me the most important thing is understanding
[2:49:09.920 --> 2:49:16.080]  that what these shots have done to destroy humanity and what the satanist luciferians the
[2:49:16.080 --> 2:49:22.320]  globalist the the the depopulation agenda what they've done with pet the pedophilia everything
[2:49:22.320 --> 2:49:27.680]  that they do the child sacrifice i mean you know in four weeks the fda is now voting and i think
[2:49:27.680 --> 2:49:33.040]  it's four weeks from this from now they're voting to put the covet shots into the
[2:49:33.040 --> 2:49:38.880]  pediatric schedule at two four six months in a year as though it were like a flu shot and it's
[2:49:38.880 --> 2:49:45.680]  absolutely not we are going we are watching child sacrifice and child murder right before our eyes
[2:49:45.680 --> 2:49:51.120]  alex and parents have got to wake up to this and not give their and not take this shot while
[2:49:51.120 --> 2:49:56.480]  they're pregnant and not take this shot and not we and not give this shot shot to their
[2:49:56.480 --> 2:50:00.720]  children their infants their two four and six month old children not give it to the five-year-old
[2:50:00.720 --> 2:50:06.240]  children we know from cardiac pediatric cardiologists that are now saying that children even that
[2:50:06.240 --> 2:50:12.720]  are asymptomatic if they have received this covet shot 50 percent of them 50 50 percent
[2:50:12.720 --> 2:50:18.240]  have myocarditis which increases their risk of sudden cardiac death and shades decades off
[2:50:18.240 --> 2:50:24.720]  their life we're watching child sacrifice in real time and the doctors are complicit the nurses
[2:50:24.720 --> 2:50:29.760]  giving the shots are complicit and parents who dragged their kids in to get them these shots
[2:50:29.760 --> 2:50:37.200]  they are complicit also yes it's barbaric it must stop we must stop the fda from doing this
[2:50:37.200 --> 2:50:42.560]  there's a whole committee of people that we're working really hard to call as many people as
[2:50:42.560 --> 2:50:49.040]  you can to bombard the fda and not allow them to approve these covet shots to be given to suit
[2:50:49.040 --> 2:50:54.080]  two four and six month old babies we know from dr. kerry midday's work who carries a very dear
[2:50:54.080 --> 2:51:01.040]  friend of mine that she's been in contact with two different centers that do in-feetral fertilization
[2:51:01.040 --> 2:51:06.880]  and they had embryos of of parents both parents that were injected and these embryos were not
[2:51:06.880 --> 2:51:13.120]  going to be used because they got pregnant and so they decided to do autopsies on these embryos
[2:51:13.120 --> 2:51:19.600]  and found unbelievable horrific things in terms of their their organs that were deformed and not
[2:51:19.600 --> 2:51:24.880]  developed the genetic abnormalities the clotting in different things you know the globalists are
[2:51:24.880 --> 2:51:30.000]  doing everything that they possibly can to kill off and murder people from the top down to get
[2:51:30.000 --> 2:51:37.200]  rid of many athletes and health care professionals and military people from the top down and so if
[2:51:37.200 --> 2:51:44.720]  they're doing taking on doing all this effort to depopulate the plan of adults they are certainly
[2:51:44.720 --> 2:51:50.720]  going to do a lot to kill off children and to make them infertile so that down the road people
[2:51:50.720 --> 2:51:56.800]  cannot reproduce and fill up humanity with everything that they have destroyed and obliterated
[2:51:57.440 --> 2:52:02.080]  that's right there's a global depopulation of it happening not just to kill people or starve them but
[2:52:02.080 --> 2:52:06.960]  to destroy our human genetics and the studies i've seen say that the spike proteins are going to be
[2:52:06.960 --> 2:52:13.680]  passed on in the genetics this is it does it definitely does please continue sorry well it
[2:52:13.680 --> 2:52:18.240]  really does and here's the thing alex we know you know i wrote two ebooks they're available on
[2:52:18.240 --> 2:52:24.160]  my website dr tempedi.com one is called the 20 mechanisms of injury how the shots make you sick
[2:52:24.160 --> 2:52:30.720]  or kill you two months later i reduced a second ebook called the 20 more mechanisms of injury how
[2:52:30.720 --> 2:52:37.040]  these covid shots can make you sick or kill you so i've identified at least 40 40 40 different ways
[2:52:37.040 --> 2:52:42.240]  that these shots can make you sick acutely or make you chronically ill with heart disease
[2:52:42.240 --> 2:52:48.080]  neurological problems long-term autoimmune diseases a long list of cancers that we're seeing
[2:52:48.080 --> 2:52:54.480]  exploding everywhere once you have been injected with these shots this is a protein that goes on
[2:52:54.480 --> 2:52:59.360]  and on and on we're now seeing that perhaps the messenger RNA never degrades and perhaps
[2:52:59.360 --> 2:53:03.680]  replicates over and over in perpetuity that's right because we were only two years in the
[2:53:03.680 --> 2:53:08.720]  studies are there and for me i'm not a scientist like you but i can read all the literature it's
[2:53:08.720 --> 2:53:14.640]  like the hiv spike protein with mad cow it's it's what it is and they're like growing a poison
[2:53:14.640 --> 2:53:20.400]  crystallinus yes and what they want to do with this through the quantum computing through the
[2:53:20.400 --> 2:53:25.280]  quantum computing and people people really have to understand what they're doing that these that
[2:53:25.280 --> 2:53:30.400]  these computers the quantum computers assess every possible answer that can possibly be answered at
[2:53:30.400 --> 2:53:36.240]  the same time and then the computer tells you how to think and what to say so they're now creating
[2:53:36.240 --> 2:53:42.960]  something called the hive mind hiv the hive mind where every person on the planet who will be labeled
[2:53:42.960 --> 2:53:50.480]  and numbered and will be a node they will be given a similar avatar in real time and that the brain
[2:53:50.480 --> 2:53:57.120]  computer interface with this quantum entanglement hat that occurs will create at an avatar of you
[2:53:57.120 --> 2:54:03.360]  out there in the metaverse so that they can eliminate you the human just like the movie just
[2:54:03.360 --> 2:54:08.720]  like the movies have showed like the movie avatar has showed us that they will do people your audience
[2:54:08.720 --> 2:54:15.200]  need to understand the word and start investigating the the concept of quantum entanglement that two
[2:54:15.200 --> 2:54:20.160]  pings are so closely bound together and that they are resonating together through quantum
[2:54:20.160 --> 2:54:25.360]  entanglement that you can even separate them by a light year away and if you affect one you're
[2:54:25.360 --> 2:54:30.160]  still you're affecting the other one that's what's happening with these nanobot technologies
[2:54:30.160 --> 2:54:34.800]  right this is the observer effect taken the next level and they're putting the circuits in for us
[2:54:35.440 --> 2:54:42.400]  knowing that like if you poison a million cockroaches 20 will mutate to defeat it they're poisoning us
[2:54:43.040 --> 2:54:48.720]  with all this nanotech to see who mutates and survives to then use them as the model for them
[2:54:48.720 --> 2:54:55.200]  to become the new synthetic ubervention and that's the plan Dr. Sherry Timbitty thank you so much
[2:54:55.200 --> 2:55:01.680]  please join us again very soon absolutely Alex thank you so much thank you all right we're going
[2:55:01.680 --> 2:55:05.760]  to go to break i'm going to come back and take two segments of calls and then we'll have a special
[2:55:05.760 --> 2:55:12.560]  guest in studio with some big solutions but i just want to thank listeners because we're in the

[3:01:26.240 --> 3:01:30.960]  this is devastating for us absolutely i feel the same way i just feel like
[3:01:31.920 --> 3:01:36.720]  i just it's something that is irreversible i mean it's like it's done it's over with you
[3:01:36.720 --> 3:01:42.480]  know it's it's now been committed you know and watch our so-called leaders doing it while
[3:01:42.480 --> 3:01:47.120]  they claim there for us it just shows their puppets so what do you think's gonna happen
[3:01:48.400 --> 3:01:52.960]  i i just feel like they're gonna continue on and feel like the path that we're on currently is just
[3:01:52.960 --> 3:01:59.120]  gonna get uh heavier deeper and it's gonna be uh i don't know it just it's it's gonna be worse
[3:01:59.120 --> 3:02:04.240]  you know it's gonna get worse and i just um you know i just feel like i don't know how
[3:02:04.240 --> 3:02:09.520]  it's to pull people together like you have been and you've you know that you've uh ideas that
[3:02:09.520 --> 3:02:15.440]  you've offered others to do and uh i just man i every time i try to tell someone it's just uh
[3:02:15.440 --> 3:02:20.000]  you know they don't believe it and i'm like your leader is on tv telling you these demons are telling
[3:02:20.000 --> 3:02:24.560]  you you know point blank what they're gonna do and they just blow a buy and drive by car lots
[3:02:24.560 --> 3:02:28.160]  that people still buy in fifteen sixty thousand dollar new cars and like i don't know how you
[3:02:28.160 --> 3:02:34.160]  expect before this stuff i just don't know how the average person average you know wage earner can uh
[3:02:34.160 --> 3:02:39.520]  move on you know well exactly we we can see a little bit ahead the future so we know the music
[3:02:39.520 --> 3:02:45.040]  stopping and we're like what do you but they think they think we're just buzz killing but you're
[3:02:45.040 --> 3:02:49.840]  absolutely right what is the general public gonna do when they figure out the party's over that this
[3:02:49.840 --> 3:02:55.280]  is gonna not be pretty no it's not and that's what scares me the most i mean just seeing the
[3:02:55.280 --> 3:02:59.280]  trouble that we have currently uh just in the state that we're in and i can't imagine once
[3:02:59.280 --> 3:03:05.120]  can be like when it gets even worse um and i just you know i pray for everyone and i you know i think
[3:03:05.120 --> 3:03:10.400]  about what the the bible says about being in the world not out of the world but along with that that
[3:03:10.400 --> 3:03:14.560]  also means that we're supposed to help others help them see help them understand help them get in a
[3:03:14.560 --> 3:03:21.280]  better position and uh you know and i think about the about what's happening to us um then attacking
[3:03:21.280 --> 3:03:25.360]  us physically and spiritually you know and as in the days of nowhere socials was coming and sent
[3:03:25.360 --> 3:03:29.760]  envy son of man be and what is happening what happened in those days is currently happening
[3:03:29.760 --> 3:03:35.280]  right now for our eyes with the dna and the sexualization of children and i mean i just i cannot
[3:03:35.280 --> 3:03:39.920]  believe how fast this is happening it's like they just they blew the damn wide open and everything

[3:03:49.600 --> 3:03:55.440]  wounding in this we just got to pray to god and ask god to just just help us make it through this
[3:03:55.440 --> 3:04:02.240]  because this is history happening right now and i appreciate your call very powerful words eric

[3:04:13.520 --> 3:04:18.800]  guest in studio i saw this i researched and i talked to folks that were involved in it and i'm like
[3:04:18.800 --> 3:04:26.320]  wow this out of all the stuff going on is really important so that's in about 15 minutes with a
[3:04:26.320 --> 3:04:32.160]  special guest in studio i'll tell you about that but yeah it's also kind of liberating how bad
[3:04:32.160 --> 3:04:37.280]  things are because all the little stupid stuff doesn't matter now does it i mean really like
[3:04:37.280 --> 3:04:42.720]  i got all these other globalist things attacking me and it's like you guys figured out what's about
[3:04:42.720 --> 3:04:48.640]  to go down you think like it's just it's it's it's actually sad though well they're right back info
[3:04:48.640 --> 3:05:02.160]  wars dot com tomorrow's news today our world is so full of hype we are force-fed dehumanizing
[3:05:02.160 --> 3:05:08.080]  propaganda by the corporate media by the controlled churches and the universities why is this the case
[3:05:08.080 --> 3:05:14.560]  because we innately by god have been given the keys for our own minds our own psyches our own souls
[3:05:15.280 --> 3:05:21.920]  and by connecting to god we can empower ourselves and trend send the quote fallen or sinful state
[3:05:22.720 --> 3:05:27.760]  so the chemicals that we ingest and and all the things we try to bring into our bodies to to
[3:05:27.760 --> 3:05:32.880]  change who we are are only lowering us they're only making us more depressed in the end they're
[3:05:32.880 --> 3:05:38.160]  only making us less filled it is only by going within and really making that connection to god
[3:05:38.160 --> 3:05:43.680]  that we can truly empower ourselves that's why the globe was bombardous and toxins and chemicals
[3:05:43.680 --> 3:05:48.320]  to block us getting the normal vitamins and minerals and trace elements our bodies need to
[3:05:48.320 --> 3:05:53.520]  healthy and to be able to basically reach out beyond the third dimension and that's where the
[3:05:53.520 --> 3:06:02.560]  incredible products come in and for store dot com leading up frontal assault on the lies of the new
[3:06:02.560 --> 3:06:08.240]  world order it's alex jones baby

[3:06:42.560 --> 3:06:46.640]  bill and i'm going to start the show with it and he said i don't give anything about hollywood
[3:06:46.640 --> 3:06:51.200]  or the elite i care about our children our people when he banned them doing pedophile training in
[3:06:51.200 --> 3:06:56.880]  schools in florida and right then c and m i know he's real i know he's not a fraud i know he's not
[3:06:56.880 --> 3:07:02.080]  serving satan that matter he went to yale or was a navy seal i could tell you he's the real deal and
[3:07:02.080 --> 3:07:07.920]  he wants humanity have a future because he loves his children it's the last minute guys tell me
[3:07:07.920 --> 3:07:13.120]  how long it is so i hit it perfectly but we're gonna play to sannis when he said that bill signing
[3:07:13.120 --> 3:07:17.680]  yesterday because that's the stuff of it we're gonna go out with that then i got a special
[3:07:17.680 --> 3:07:22.400]  guest on and then i got some mark die stuff and i want to hit four or five of your calls right now
[3:07:22.400 --> 3:07:29.200]  daniel in missouri you're on the air go ahead hey elix first of all god bless you and your team
[3:07:29.200 --> 3:07:33.440]  uh you know you guys listen and should all check out that elderberry
[3:07:35.200 --> 3:07:39.920]  you guys got with the anthro sionin's in it that'll be really good a lot of good stuff
[3:07:39.920 --> 3:07:47.360]  well what's your view on the gold the dollar and the crash well um you know if this all goes down
[3:07:47.360 --> 3:07:52.480]  which it really seems like it's going to be i i thought a lot about bartering and stuff i just
[3:07:52.480 --> 3:07:57.920]  feel like uh maybe gold won't be as valuable as getting to know your neighbors trade things with
[3:07:57.920 --> 3:08:02.400]  your neighbors once this goes down people are going to be thinking day to day so it's really
[3:08:02.400 --> 3:08:08.480]  important to keep telling people what's going on and build a community wherever you are if
[3:08:08.480 --> 3:08:14.080]  if you're able to community is real value the amish aren't going to even know this is happening
[3:08:14.800 --> 3:08:20.160]  but watch the lettles say make them join with us the first thing they'll do is attack the amish
[3:08:20.160 --> 3:08:25.040]  and the men and knights when this happens because 400 years ago in austria in austria in germany
[3:08:25.040 --> 3:08:29.360]  and switzerland they figured it out they were being killed for being protestants they said we're
[3:08:29.360 --> 3:08:32.640]  going to go to the new world we're going to do our own deal and they've known this is coming forever
[3:08:32.640 --> 3:08:39.520]  honestly i'm thinking about going and living with the amish the way things are going well who
[3:08:39.520 --> 3:08:45.040]  knows unless you join them brother but i hear you it's it's it's it's huge all right thank you for
[3:08:45.040 --> 3:08:51.200]  the call god bless you all right let's go to another caller here let's talk to a floridian
[3:08:51.840 --> 3:08:57.520]  nick nick from florida go ahead who are alex who brought all you info warriors out there
[3:08:57.520 --> 3:09:02.720]  i want to tell you that you know we don't need to have fear because there's a lot of people in
[3:09:02.720 --> 3:09:08.720]  this country who want change and who have a plan and no i hear you i have fear for the
[3:09:08.720 --> 3:09:13.680]  children i i'm i mean i'm this is going to be really bad okay but i hear you i'm not worried
[3:09:13.680 --> 3:09:18.320]  about me or you but man what about the children well when it comes time to think we defend those
[3:09:18.320 --> 3:09:22.160]  children if that if that presents its time then i mean i guess we're all gonna have to make those
[3:09:22.160 --> 3:09:26.880]  choice i know they're gonna get you turning the power off brother well then we need to turn the
[3:09:26.880 --> 3:09:31.680]  power back on sir and my recommendation is this that we don't wait till they collapse the dollar
[3:09:31.680 --> 3:09:36.960]  that we do away with that ourselves and that we use we circumnavigate the federal reserve
[3:09:36.960 --> 3:09:41.360]  by allowing you know i agree we need state governments having emergency hearings right now
[3:09:41.920 --> 3:09:46.640]  about issuing state currencies for collapse i agree damn right you're damn right that's what we
[3:09:46.640 --> 3:09:52.480]  need we need the states to lead the way now with the people absolutely and if people think already
[3:09:52.480 --> 3:09:58.560]  that we don't live in some form of of communist control they're they're dead wrong we have universal
[3:09:58.560 --> 3:10:03.840]  basic income already and it exists in social security it exists in and people who receive
[3:10:03.840 --> 3:10:10.560]  va compensation it resists it exists in welfare it exists in all types of different forms of
[3:10:10.560 --> 3:10:17.600]  these dirty bankers like larry think are making their move on us right now and it's time for us
[3:10:17.600 --> 3:10:21.360]  to stand together and stop them and if we need to come together as a force through neighborhood
[3:10:21.360 --> 3:10:26.400]  watch units then that's what we'll do because every every neighborhood in this country has a way to
[3:10:26.400 --> 3:10:30.880]  come together but i mean if we could get back to the to the dollar point of it i have a i have a
[3:10:30.880 --> 3:10:35.680]  full blown plan strategy here that kind of lays out in more detail but it would take too long
[3:10:36.480 --> 3:10:44.080]  but just by it by allowing the u.s trek everybody they're they're stimulus when that went out and
[3:10:44.720 --> 3:10:48.720]  hold on did i lose you guys sorry no you're fine just go between blue chairs good sorry go ahead
[3:10:48.720 --> 3:10:55.040]  it all right so anyway during the pandemic when they sent everything out they that check came from
[3:10:55.040 --> 3:10:58.960]  the u.s treasury when you get your income tax check back at the end of the year that comes from the
[3:10:58.960 --> 3:11:04.000]  u.s treasury the federal reserve doesn't send that and the american people don't need permission
[3:11:04.000 --> 3:11:08.960]  from the federal reserve to print money so if we have to subsidize our power supply by hiring more
[3:11:08.960 --> 3:11:13.840]  u.s workers and paying them directly through the u.s no i agree and we know the globalists are doing
[3:11:13.840 --> 3:11:18.880]  this on purpose and aren't our saviors we can use this to become independent against them that's
[3:11:18.880 --> 3:11:22.480]  why it's critical to know they're the ones engineering and so they're not the leaders
[3:11:22.480 --> 3:11:27.520]  during the crisis thank you so much nick mike in alaska thank you for holding i really appreciate
[3:11:27.520 --> 3:11:33.520]  you calling okay hey uh alex uh fellow texan up here living on the edge of the wilderness in
[3:11:33.520 --> 3:11:40.800]  alaska i envy you i just wanted to point out the source of all the world's problems can actually
[3:11:40.800 --> 3:11:47.520]  be traced to the dishonest monetary system that was foisted on american 1913 until we removed that
[3:11:47.520 --> 3:11:54.240]  the power of privately owned central banks to to basically counterfeit u.s currency nothing's
[3:11:54.240 --> 3:11:58.800]  ever going to change i mean we have got no i agree but now they're going to take that to the next
[3:11:58.800 --> 3:12:03.040]  level with a smart app that tracks and controls everything we do so they got to kill the dollar
[3:12:03.040 --> 3:12:08.800]  to parlay this basket of currencies run by the un i mean we're now there it ain't coming now brother
[3:12:08.800 --> 3:12:14.640]  we're here can you believe this but like jeff i mean like uh frank once said you go instead of
[3:12:14.640 --> 3:12:20.080]  cursing the darkness we have to lie to cancel and the way we do it you get an obstacle in front
[3:12:20.080 --> 3:12:25.760]  of you you've got to learn to go around it and just like that last caller said we have got to learn
[3:12:25.760 --> 3:12:32.880]  to uh transact with one another in gold and silver we got to get back i agree and barter and every
[3:12:32.880 --> 3:12:37.440]  and exactly i think this is going to be our greatest moment here i mean i think i agree
[3:12:37.440 --> 3:12:41.040]  it's going to be rough it's going to be hard but we're about to find out who we are again
[3:12:41.040 --> 3:12:46.800]  if you have two brain cells left to rub together uh i would go out and buy as much gold and
[3:12:46.800 --> 3:12:52.400]  silvers i could get my hands on and while it's still affordable and because once once all this
[3:12:52.400 --> 3:12:57.600]  comes and they they uh i totally agree with you i had to sell all my silver and gold and my divorce
[3:12:57.600 --> 3:13:01.680]  eight years ago i mean gosh i had a half million of it i bought it was like worth two millions of
[3:13:01.680 --> 3:13:05.680]  divorce that's what paid for the divorce and everything and i basically have none of it now
[3:13:05.680 --> 3:13:09.520]  little bit of silver a little bit of gold almost nothing and you and you're right i wish i that
[3:13:09.520 --> 3:13:15.120]  is damn right brother what you're saying would be happening if we allowed it if traders in in uh
[3:13:15.680 --> 3:13:21.680]  dc had not uh you know i mean it was christmas eve night you know it was just a handful of
[3:13:21.680 --> 3:13:26.960]  congressmen you know past that because uh you know you know the story but anyway we have
[3:13:26.960 --> 3:13:32.640]  got to go around this we've got to uh come together and start trading with one another
[3:13:32.640 --> 3:13:39.920]  in gold and silver and bar that's right we had a banker coup on christmas eve 1913 and it's now
[3:13:39.920 --> 3:13:45.680]  109 years into it and now they're getting rid of us moving to the next level with china we've got
[3:13:45.680 --> 3:13:51.440]  to say no we recognize you we know who you are and we say no thank you so much mike all right
[3:13:51.440 --> 3:13:56.560]  david sinclair i'm gonna tell you who he is on the other side i had to check out by engineers
[3:13:56.560 --> 3:14:04.640]  by scientists by telecommunications experts and they say this is basically what the cia is uh and
[3:14:04.640 --> 3:14:11.280]  we're going to talk about this in real secure communications next level beyond dumb phones
[3:14:11.280 --> 3:14:17.360]  beyond satellite phones on the other side when we come back but i wanted to play a clip here of

[3:19:55.120 --> 3:20:04.000]  leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:20:06.080 --> 3:20:11.200]  thank you i'm professor mark dice i teach gender studies at california state university and my
[3:20:11.200 --> 3:20:15.200]  colleagues and i across the country have been making tremendous progress in shattering the
[3:20:15.200 --> 3:20:21.680]  gender binary we've introduced as you know a growing list of over 57 different gender identities
[3:20:21.680 --> 3:20:27.360]  many people don't know which gender they want to be it's a extremely creative process the reason
[3:20:27.360 --> 3:20:34.320]  i'm here is obviously the college students young adults their minds still fairly malleable but we've
[3:20:34.320 --> 3:20:40.800]  seen the don't say gay bill being passed in florida and if we're going to truly succeed in the new
[3:20:40.800 --> 3:20:45.920]  world order we're going to have to reach the younger children and maybe on a local level we
[3:20:45.920 --> 3:20:53.600]  could start with introducing ordinances to ban even identifying anyone as a gender at all and if we
[3:20:53.600 --> 3:20:59.920]  can stop referring to the children as just boys girls ease or she's until they're old enough to
[3:20:59.920 --> 3:21:07.280]  decide uh perhaps then we can complete the i mean let's just be honest here the marxist revolution
[3:21:07.280 --> 3:21:12.160]  we can get to the point where a lot of us can shed the label of the democrat and just openly admit
[3:21:12.160 --> 3:21:16.800]  that that we are marxists repealing the first amendment on a national level may be a little
[3:21:16.800 --> 3:21:20.880]  bit difficult but we've seen surveys conducted on the ocean side peer that there are a lot of people
[3:21:20.880 --> 3:21:26.320]  that are willing to accept that so we're just recommending the bill de berg group think tank
[3:21:26.320 --> 3:21:32.800]  some of our associates the world economic forum are recommending that on local levels we prevent
[3:21:32.800 --> 3:21:37.680]  the gendering of children at all as you know children will believe virtually anything at a
[3:21:37.680 --> 3:21:42.320]  young age they believe that a man in a red suit flies around and brings presents to them every
[3:21:42.320 --> 3:21:47.920]  christmas and if we can convince them that uh there is no such thing as gender that boys can
[3:21:47.920 --> 3:21:57.600]  be girls girls can be boys that men can get pregnant uh that women can have um external um
[3:21:57.600 --> 3:22:05.280]  genitals penises then i think that we'll be able to really succeed in what it is that we're trying
[3:22:05.280 --> 3:22:10.480]  to do here we're gonna have to start reaching the children on a younger level and again by the time
[3:22:10.480 --> 3:22:14.720]  a lot of these students reach college many of them are setting their ways some of them are watching
[3:22:14.720 --> 3:22:19.440]  tucker carlson other youtubers thank you very much sir thank you more subscribe to the mark
[3:22:19.440 --> 3:22:25.200]  dice youtube channel that's it thank you boy you gotta love mark dice with green hair and everybody
[3:22:25.200 --> 3:22:30.240]  doing this comedy thing where you just repeat what left is actually say that city councils is the new
[3:22:30.240 --> 3:22:34.800]  art form i mean i don't even track youtube and i see every day like five million views million
[3:22:34.800 --> 3:22:40.080]  views five hundred thousand views ten million views i mean people are nailing it so i'm gonna go to
[3:22:40.080 --> 3:22:44.240]  the city council soon and do my own leftist character we gotta decide what leftist character
[3:22:44.240 --> 3:22:50.080]  i'm gonna have and not much hair left we gotta make it green or purple now david sinclair i learned
[3:22:50.080 --> 3:22:55.360]  about this guy from roger stone months ago when they sponsored cpaq and then i did research and i
[3:22:55.360 --> 3:22:59.600]  talked to it people and i talked to folks involved with security communications they said yeah this
[3:22:59.600 --> 3:23:04.560]  is what everybody's been saying should be done this isn't like some proxy thing and it's not
[3:23:04.560 --> 3:23:11.600]  like you know you know some system that that's super complex it's simply what's put into your phone
[3:23:12.160 --> 3:23:17.760]  and we're gonna explain all of this so we hear all this talk about dumb phones dumb phones are great
[3:23:17.760 --> 3:23:22.400]  everybody's going to those so they don't have apps they're not as easy to track that's great but but
[3:23:22.400 --> 3:23:28.160]  what about your smartphone under your control not tracking you not tracing you and giving you
[3:23:28.160 --> 3:23:33.760]  triple layer encryption that actually works so david sinclair is here and he's becoming a big
[3:23:33.760 --> 3:23:37.840]  sponsor with us i'm fully endorsing this and i'm getting set up with it right now as well
[3:23:38.640 --> 3:23:48.560]  and it's volta wireless dot com v o l t a volta v o l t a volta wireless dot com promo code alex to
[3:23:48.560 --> 3:23:54.080]  get a big discount on signing up and and they're coming out with a secure phones at a very low
[3:23:54.080 --> 3:23:59.840]  price but right now they're ready with the sim cards but also with other systems very easily
[3:23:59.840 --> 3:24:03.520]  because i'm not a very technical guy can research technicals but i'm not good at the actual nuts and
[3:24:03.520 --> 3:24:09.200]  bolts i was able to do this in like five minutes myself so that's why i am very excited you're
[3:24:09.200 --> 3:24:15.360]  not trusting some outside system you've got hardware on your phone that's designed to
[3:24:15.360 --> 3:24:20.800]  communicate point to point seamlessly with wireless systems worldwide and protect your identity
[3:24:20.800 --> 3:24:25.760]  and more so i appreciate david sinclair he is a former telecommunications and tech industry
[3:24:25.760 --> 3:24:31.600]  executive and is now the founder and ceo of volta wireless and i just fascinated talking to you for
[3:24:31.600 --> 3:24:35.520]  hours on the phone the limited time we have here you i'm gonna try to give you the floor to talk
[3:24:35.520 --> 3:24:40.800]  about all the stuff you've done with industrial machines and pipelines and everything and what
[3:24:40.800 --> 3:24:44.560]  you're bringing people and you know i guessed that you wouldn't tell me it's all secret but
[3:24:44.560 --> 3:24:49.200]  obviously this is going to be stuff the cia wants because this is real secure communication
[3:24:49.200 --> 3:24:56.000]  absolutely this is definitely secure communications and you know as we've seen everybody last year
[3:24:56.000 --> 3:25:02.240]  was talking about how signal was the biggest thing for secure communications you need to
[3:25:02.240 --> 3:25:08.080]  get an encrypted message or you go get signal and what do we see this year lots of criminal suits
[3:25:08.080 --> 3:25:14.720]  filed by the fbi where they have messaging from signal included as some of the core pieces of
[3:25:14.720 --> 3:25:20.320]  evidence in in those cases you know it's it's not true security it's not truly secure like it's
[3:25:20.320 --> 3:25:26.400]  supposed to be you know what we see happening every single day is mobile companies and tech
[3:25:26.400 --> 3:25:31.120]  companies are using our mobile phones to track everything we do you know they know what time
[3:25:31.120 --> 3:25:33.840]  we wake up in the morning because what do most people do when they get up the morning one of
[3:25:33.840 --> 3:25:39.280]  the first things they do is pick up their mobile phone you know they know every phone call we make
[3:25:39.280 --> 3:25:44.560]  every text message you send or receive you know we're required they're required by law the mobile
[3:25:44.560 --> 3:25:51.360]  operators are to keep a record of every text message and every call for five years they know who
[3:25:51.360 --> 3:25:55.360]  you talk to when you talk to them how often you talk to them they have literally i just learned
[3:25:55.360 --> 3:25:59.520]  about that with january 6th they and it's nothing to hide but they literally got everything oh yeah
[3:25:59.520 --> 3:26:04.080]  absolutely they know every internet search that you do they know everything right that's just the
[3:26:04.080 --> 3:26:07.280]  mobile companies then you've got all the tech companies with all their apps on your phone
[3:26:07.280 --> 3:26:12.480]  that are you know calling to mama every two minutes telling facebook and amazon and everybody else
[3:26:13.360 --> 3:26:16.800]  this is where you are this is what you're doing this is what you're looking at on the internet
[3:26:16.800 --> 3:26:22.400]  you know i wonder why even your new apple phone or droid suddenly won't work for a minute but does
[3:26:22.400 --> 3:26:28.000]  later it's downloading then yeah it's it's pretty bad i'm not an engineer like you but i've been
[3:26:28.000 --> 3:26:35.280]  told that by really smart engineers like no no absolutely so the uh fdc ran tests on apple
[3:26:35.280 --> 3:26:40.240]  phones and android phones and they discovered that on average an apple phone sends information
[3:26:40.240 --> 3:26:47.440]  about you back to apple 52 times a day the average android phone sends information back to google
[3:26:48.160 --> 3:26:54.400]  14 times an hour wow that's more than 350 times a day that google is getting information from an
[3:26:54.400 --> 3:26:59.760]  android phone about you you know it's insane and you're gonna in fact if you can stay tomorrow
[3:26:59.760 --> 3:27:03.360]  i'll have you over like two hours because i'd love talking on the phone i talked to all these
[3:27:03.360 --> 3:27:07.920]  engineers they say what you're doing is dead on the answer we want people to understand this is a
[3:27:07.920 --> 3:27:13.200]  simple way to take power back in your life from hackers governments corporations you name it
[3:27:13.200 --> 3:27:19.280]  with this volt a phone this is exciting yeah this is uh this is a great opportunity to finally
[3:27:19.280 --> 3:27:24.720]  take back your privacy right to finally stop everybody tracking everything that you do so
[3:27:24.720 --> 3:27:30.000]  you know volt a wireless at its heart is a software company you know we began with the idea that
[3:27:30.000 --> 3:27:35.760]  that we want everyone to have freedom free speech be able to say what you want to do freedom of
[3:27:35.760 --> 3:27:40.000]  association be able to talk with the people you want to talk to you know these are rights that
[3:27:40.000 --> 3:27:43.440]  are guaranteed by the bill of rights you know all the political scientists i know agree
[3:27:44.160 --> 3:27:48.560]  privacy is the first right if you don't have that you have nothing but exactly you know back
[3:27:48.560 --> 3:27:52.240]  back in the revolutionary times when they wrote the constitution constitution originally and
[3:27:52.240 --> 3:27:57.120]  they did the bill of rights the fourth amendment is about the privacy of your personal effects
[3:27:57.120 --> 3:28:01.440]  effects back then we didn't have digital effects everything was on paper so it was the privacy
[3:28:01.440 --> 3:28:05.360]  of your papers and your personal effects in your own home you couldn't be searched without a warrant
[3:28:06.080 --> 3:28:11.920]  today unfortunately you know the supreme court has never ruled that digital things are considered
[3:28:11.920 --> 3:28:17.200]  to be personal effects if you send an email that goes through multiple servers on the way to its
[3:28:17.200 --> 3:28:21.120]  destination and because you're using other people's servers it's no longer considered to be your
[3:28:21.120 --> 3:28:25.120]  personal communications even though there's really no difference between a personal letter that you
[3:28:25.120 --> 3:28:29.040]  send that the post office carries for you and an email that you send that some email provider
[3:28:29.040 --> 3:28:32.320]  carries for you let's talk about when you come back because i talk to you all the time it's amazing
[3:28:32.320 --> 3:28:38.960]  what you know this is a way to just ignore that legally protect yourself and how important it is
[3:28:38.960 --> 3:28:44.240]  and it's just the sim card and you're done you don't have to mess with it like all these other
[3:28:44.240 --> 3:28:49.120]  systems that don't work because i've been i've had folks 30 plus companies come to us and say do this
[3:28:49.120 --> 3:28:55.120]  do that sell this phone do that i looked at it didn't really work this is the first one that works

[3:29:07.040 --> 3:29:12.480]  for this and people are really waking up right now but we had to build our own infrastructure
[3:29:12.480 --> 3:29:17.440]  because of the censorship and de-platforming that cost tens of millions of dollars and now
[3:29:17.440 --> 3:29:22.640]  with bandot video getting close to 10 million views a day we're a platform for thousands
[3:29:22.640 --> 3:29:29.120]  of independent journalists and groups to be able to post their content free of charge and because
[3:29:29.120 --> 3:29:36.160]  it's become so successful it's a catch 22 info wars and bandot video have become a mothership
[3:29:36.160 --> 3:29:42.160]  promoting the pro-human liberty movement worldwide but the expenses in bandwidth alone are millions
[3:29:42.160 --> 3:29:47.040]  of dollars a quarter hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars a month so the biggest sale

[3:31:07.760 --> 3:31:14.640]  newspapers that the family as we know it is a bad thing that must be ended and the first step in that
[3:31:14.640 --> 3:31:20.160]  is getting women out of the household and teaching women that cooking dinner and taking care of their
[3:31:20.160 --> 3:31:24.800]  sons and daughters and husbands is a bad thing and i was just sitting here tonight making dinner

[3:33:31.440 --> 3:33:37.760]  with us volto wireless dot com and they are locked they've launched months ago with cpac as a big
[3:33:37.760 --> 3:33:45.280]  sponsor more gotten rave reviews systems where you have these simulated sim cards we want to be clear
[3:33:45.280 --> 3:33:49.520]  that so many people talked about versus real ones you want a physical one they've got it they've
[3:33:49.520 --> 3:33:56.000]  got virtual ones it's so easy as one click and this is a real solution i'm so excited about it so
[3:33:56.000 --> 3:34:01.520]  please give viewers and listeners mr. cinclair the same presentation you've given me i don't know
[3:34:01.520 --> 3:34:05.280]  if i can give you the exact same one but you know here's here's the background volto wireless began
[3:34:05.280 --> 3:34:09.920]  with the idea of we want people to be able to be free and so we want them to be able to have their
[3:34:09.920 --> 3:34:13.600]  privacy back and so the first thing we looked at is what's the most important thing in free speech
[3:34:13.600 --> 3:34:17.680]  well it's free communication the ability to share information with one another and so the first
[3:34:17.680 --> 3:34:20.800]  thing we did was we worked on an encrypted messenger and everybody's you know we talked about
[3:34:20.800 --> 3:34:25.520]  signal a moment ago signal uses basic end-to-end encryption they're using an open source piece
[3:34:25.520 --> 3:34:30.720]  of code and lo and behold you know we discovered of course that the fbi and frankly other government
[3:34:30.720 --> 3:34:35.120]  agencies have figured out how to hack that code right there's a company in israel called nso
[3:34:35.120 --> 3:34:39.040]  they have a software called peg assist they sell it to governments around the world they specialize
[3:34:39.040 --> 3:34:44.800]  in in hacking encrypted communications so when you look at the fbi cases that were filed in january
[3:34:44.800 --> 3:34:49.920]  about a lot of the january 6 events that happened what you find is a lot of signal communications
[3:34:49.920 --> 3:34:54.080]  are used as evidence in those cases because the fbi's figured out how to get to them you know the
[3:34:54.080 --> 3:34:58.320]  next step then is okay well how do you improve upon that well we developed our own encrypted
[3:34:58.320 --> 3:35:07.840]  messenger which allows you to do calls messaging file transfer with and also voice and video calls
[3:35:07.840 --> 3:35:14.480]  both with up to a thousand people at the same time and it uses three layers of 256 bit encryption
[3:35:14.480 --> 3:35:20.080]  that's huge i'm told oh yeah three layers so three layers you know 256 bit encryption is what the
[3:35:20.080 --> 3:35:27.600]  nsa uses to communicate top secret materials three layers of 256 bit encryption it takes uh every
[3:35:27.600 --> 3:35:33.440]  super computer in the world more than a million years to break through three layers of 256 bit
[3:35:33.440 --> 3:35:37.680]  encryption essentially the computing power does not exist in the world today to hack through that
[3:35:37.680 --> 3:35:41.280]  wow okay so so there's no way somebody's going to be able to root and that's what volto wireless
[3:35:41.280 --> 3:35:45.520]  does that's built into our our messaging software absolutely that was the story you know like i said
[3:35:45.520 --> 3:35:50.560]  over 30 groups have approached us i've shown my people they're not that good people like well this
[3:35:50.560 --> 3:35:56.880]  is it what you've done so how are you so different how'd you do this well you know um a lot of this
[3:35:56.880 --> 3:36:02.080]  comes from i spent the last 30 years working in the tech industry and telecommunications uh i was
[3:36:02.080 --> 3:36:06.400]  doing big systems integration outsourcing projects around the world most of the time in emerging
[3:36:06.400 --> 3:36:11.440]  markets where i was constantly being tracked by the local secret police because they thought oh is
[3:36:11.440 --> 3:36:15.840]  this a guy a spy he's implementing some government it system you know and so i was used to constantly
[3:36:15.840 --> 3:36:20.480]  having my communications monitored having people trying to trail me see where i'm going who i'm
[3:36:20.480 --> 3:36:23.840]  meeting with that kind of thing i came back to the states and you were telling me like you were
[3:36:23.840 --> 3:36:30.800]  like a kazikistan putting in like pipelines so i wireless i uh so i was living in i've lived in
[3:36:30.800 --> 3:36:37.200]  russia ukraine kazakhstan georgia kazakhstan sorry that's okay i i've worked in tejikistan as well
[3:36:37.200 --> 3:36:43.120]  so i i've been all over the stands uh but uh you know what i was doing there though in my last
[3:36:43.120 --> 3:36:46.320]  business over there i was doing industrial automation projects we were implementing pipeline
[3:36:46.320 --> 3:36:51.120]  management systems railway traffic management systems utility management systems those sort
[3:36:51.120 --> 3:36:57.520]  of things and what we discovered is that all of them use this certain kind of sim card to do their
[3:36:57.520 --> 3:37:01.440]  wireless communications it's what's called a machine to machine sim card is designed just for
[3:37:01.440 --> 3:37:06.640]  transmitting data from one machine to another m to m sim cards and what we figured out is you know
[3:37:06.640 --> 3:37:10.560]  you can encrypt that data you know that's why you use data instead of voice and sms because it's easy
[3:37:10.560 --> 3:37:14.160]  to encrypt and there's no server in the middle and you basically have those machines communicating
[3:37:14.160 --> 3:37:17.840]  to each other without any server in the middle about anyone being able to monitor it and so when
[3:37:17.840 --> 3:37:22.560]  you look at our messenger it's designed for peer-to-peer communications just like that then on
[3:37:22.560 --> 3:37:28.000]  top of that we're using these m to m sim cards to provide everybody with access to 800 mobile
[3:37:28.000 --> 3:37:33.360]  networks in 200 countries around the world so here in the u.s. with our sim card or our e-sim
[3:37:33.360 --> 3:37:38.400]  you get access both to the t-mobile and at&t networks you get unlimited talk text and high
[3:37:38.400 --> 3:37:43.840]  speed data on them and it's all encrypted you know you you don't have to worry about somebody
[3:37:43.840 --> 3:37:48.960]  monitoring your internet activity or monitoring your communications because they can't it's all
[3:37:48.960 --> 3:37:54.560]  encrypted it's all secure then on top of that at the same time that we launched the mobile platform
[3:37:54.560 --> 3:37:59.040]  last year we also launched the volt to private payment system and what this is and you're familiar
[3:37:59.040 --> 3:38:03.840]  with venmo cash app what the volt to private payment system really is all about is you being able
[3:38:03.840 --> 3:38:08.400]  to do financial transactions without somebody collecting and selling your data so venmo and
[3:38:08.400 --> 3:38:12.320]  cash app the big part of their business is collecting your financial transactions and selling
[3:38:12.320 --> 3:38:17.040]  them to third parties they sell them to banks they sell them insurance companies credit people
[3:38:17.040 --> 3:38:20.960]  everything so so you know it's not just your financial transactions by the way that they're
[3:38:20.960 --> 3:38:25.760]  selling they're figuring out what did you buy where did you buy it and because that app is
[3:38:25.760 --> 3:38:30.160]  always communicating your location they're also figuring out who was with you when you bought
[3:38:30.160 --> 3:38:35.440]  it when you went to the dinner at that restaurant and you guys split up the bill they know exactly
[3:38:35.440 --> 3:38:40.640]  who everybody was at that meal databases exactly and they sell and you've done nothing wrong but
[3:38:40.640 --> 3:38:44.480]  they're using it against you you've got to get that's why i'm so impressed what you guys have
[3:38:44.480 --> 3:38:49.200]  done david because i've talked to a lot of really smart people they go man this is the system this
[3:38:49.200 --> 3:38:54.000]  is what should have been done and you've finally done it and it's so easy how do people call or
[3:38:54.000 --> 3:38:59.360]  how do people go online how do they download this how do they get it on their phone yeah so it's
[3:38:59.360 --> 3:39:06.080]  actually very simple you go out to voltowireless.com you sign up for a subscription once you get your
[3:39:06.080 --> 3:39:10.320]  subscription you pay for it you get issued what's called a volt to private number this is a new
[3:39:10.320 --> 3:39:16.480]  anonymous phone number that has no association with you you use that to log in with your password
[3:39:16.480 --> 3:39:21.440]  in the end of the app and you set up the app you're going to download an e-sim to your phone or you
[3:39:21.440 --> 3:39:27.040]  can actually order a sim card if you prefer to have a sim card and once you do that you have access to
[3:39:27.040 --> 3:39:32.320]  unlimited talk text and high-speed data and i was able to do this very quickly the other day
[3:39:32.320 --> 3:39:37.200]  in like five minutes and i know how stuff works but i'm not good at actually doing it myself
[3:39:37.200 --> 3:39:42.400]  and it was very easy yeah absolutely you know what we found we did research on this subject we
[3:39:42.400 --> 3:39:47.760]  figured out that the vast majority of people are concerned about the privacy they know their data
[3:39:47.760 --> 3:39:51.680]  is getting collected they hate it they don't want it to be collected they feel like it's theirs
[3:39:51.680 --> 3:39:56.560]  and they're right and and the problem is everybody feels like you have to have a phd in cyber security
[3:39:56.560 --> 3:40:01.520]  to know what the heck to do so our big focus was okay you know what there's thousands of company
[3:40:01.520 --> 3:40:06.480]  out there out there offering thousands of niche solutions and all of them solve some small part
[3:40:06.480 --> 3:40:11.120]  of the problem maybe they encrypt your internet activity maybe they give you communications
[3:40:11.120 --> 3:40:14.800]  maybe they help you through financial transactions really not too many people doing anything around
[3:40:14.800 --> 3:40:19.600]  the mobile coverage and we said you know what we want to give it all to everyone in one simple
[3:40:19.600 --> 3:40:25.360]  to use package one subscription everything you need and so that's what we did and it's lower
[3:40:25.360 --> 3:40:29.600]  than most phone bills that's why david this is insane every listener should go and do this right
[3:40:29.600 --> 3:40:33.680]  now absolutely you know for thirty nine ninety nine a month you're going to get unlimited talk text
[3:40:33.680 --> 3:40:38.480]  and high speed data plus all of these privacy features so you that know that nobody's using
[3:40:38.480 --> 3:40:43.200]  your mobile phone to track you everywhere you go anymore you know it'll hide your location your
[3:40:43.200 --> 3:40:49.040]  identity your communications your internet activity your financial transactions and we've got more
[3:40:49.040 --> 3:40:53.440]  features coming down the road you know one of the why is nobody else doing this like you are a and
[3:40:53.440 --> 3:40:58.720]  then b how have you not gotten in trouble with the disruptive technology because i know they
[3:40:58.720 --> 3:41:03.920]  come after people that he would try to launch something close to this yeah well uh why is nobody
[3:41:03.920 --> 3:41:07.920]  doing this i don't know honestly when i did the research and discovered that this wasn't going on
[3:41:07.920 --> 3:41:12.400]  i was shocked i was like because again use machine to machine you're using totally different system
[3:41:12.400 --> 3:41:15.840]  that's on the phones already that they're using to report back you're using that
[3:41:16.480 --> 3:41:20.880]  well you know it's it's just the exact same thing that's been used for ten years in industrial
[3:41:20.880 --> 3:41:25.840]  automation you know all of these devices that you got around your home they're communicating back
[3:41:25.840 --> 3:41:30.080]  to the mothership using machine to machine data you're watching machine your computer you're just
[3:41:30.080 --> 3:41:34.960]  using a refrigerator you know it's the exact same technology you know one of the things that i'm
[3:41:34.960 --> 3:41:38.880]  really surprised about you just so you understand i've worked for 30 years in the tech industry
[3:41:38.880 --> 3:41:44.240]  primarily in sales primarily in business management i'm not an engineer by training i've learned

[3:45:52.480 --> 3:45:59.840]  real piece of history at 1776coin.com the eugenicist over 100 years ago were very public about their
[3:45:59.840 --> 3:46:05.920]  plans they financed major universities they ran full-page stories and advertisements pushing
[3:46:05.920 --> 3:46:11.040]  their propaganda of new york times other major newspapers that the family as we know it is a
[3:46:11.040 --> 3:46:16.720]  bad thing and must be ended and the first step in that is getting women out of the household
[3:46:16.720 --> 3:46:22.320]  teaching women that cooking dinner and taking care of their sons and daughters and husbands is a bad
[3:46:22.320 --> 3:46:27.520]  thing and i was just sitting here tonight making dinner for my daughter my four-national daughter
[3:46:27.520 --> 3:46:30.960]  my wife makes dinner a lot of times but i like to make it as well i love to make breakfast
[3:46:31.600 --> 3:46:35.920]  and literally it's the funnest thing on earth to make food for your family and be
[3:46:35.920 --> 3:46:42.000]  nutritive and then all sit down together and have the communal event and that's what the system
[3:46:42.000 --> 3:46:48.240]  is attacking and bombarded is our normal biological actions and coming together they really are sick
[3:46:48.800 --> 3:46:53.840]  evil scientific cult of filth that want to domesticate us and turn us into lab rats we
[3:46:53.840 --> 3:47:03.120]  cannot let this continue leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order it's alex jones
[3:47:11.280 --> 3:47:15.920]  folks i only bring you things i believe in and what david sinclair and volto wireless
[3:47:16.480 --> 3:47:18.080]  have created is game changing
[3:47:18.080 --> 3:47:25.200]  better volto wireless dot com use promo code ouch get a big discount signing up for their
[3:47:25.200 --> 3:47:31.360]  virtual sim or the olsina sim card for your cell phone that uses machine to machine communications
[3:47:31.360 --> 3:47:38.320]  and triple layered encryption to defeat all these different surveillance systems this is
[3:47:38.880 --> 3:47:44.400]  the future so in the 10 minutes we've got left david sinclair to lay out really how incredible this is
[3:47:44.400 --> 3:47:50.080]  but you know what we did was we built our system based on ignorance by design you know you asked
[3:47:50.080 --> 3:47:53.680]  before why hasn't the government come after you you know the government's welcome to come after me
[3:47:54.240 --> 3:47:58.320]  we've got nothing to hide because we've got no data you know it's crazy we have massive amounts
[3:47:58.320 --> 3:48:02.640]  of processing power and memory but the guys who do hosting force are like well don't you want
[3:48:02.640 --> 3:48:06.960]  some more storage i'm like well no because we don't collect any data when subscribers sign up
[3:48:06.960 --> 3:48:10.720]  they sign up anonymously they provide an email address and they provide a payment method but
[3:48:10.720 --> 3:48:14.560]  so you guys are a switch you're not you're not you know we don't we don't collect the payment
[3:48:14.560 --> 3:48:17.200]  the payment method you know we actually have a third party that handles all of our payment
[3:48:17.200 --> 3:48:21.920]  processing for us they get the payment method so you sign up anonymously unlike your mobile
[3:48:21.920 --> 3:48:26.320]  operator we're not collecting your location we're not keeping track of your communications frankly
[3:48:26.320 --> 3:48:30.560]  we can't keep track of your communications we designed our system so that even if we wanted
[3:48:30.560 --> 3:48:34.960]  to or somebody wanted to hack into our system and try to track you they can't there's nothing
[3:48:34.960 --> 3:48:39.200]  there to do it with you know that that's the whole focus is we want people to have complete
[3:48:39.200 --> 3:48:42.800]  freedom you know how many times you've been on the phone and you said you know maybe i shouldn't
[3:48:42.800 --> 3:48:47.120]  say this on the phone but or maybe i shouldn't have said that on the phone because somebody
[3:48:47.120 --> 3:48:51.600]  might be listening well the truth is you are getting monitored that's the truth today you know
[3:48:51.600 --> 3:48:58.240]  even if you have a dumb phone every call every text the operator's got a record of it the government
[3:48:58.240 --> 3:49:04.720]  gets access to it that's the law today and what we're doing is changing that paradigm completely
[3:49:04.720 --> 3:49:09.120]  by making everything encrypted so that even if somebody's able to get into it there is just
[3:49:09.120 --> 3:49:13.360]  no way that they're going to be able to figure out what what it actually is who you are even you
[3:49:13.360 --> 3:49:19.200]  know even if you call somebody who's not a volta subscriber using the volta app what's going to
[3:49:19.200 --> 3:49:23.920]  happen well yes it's not encrypted when it gets to your friend's phone because he's not using volta
[3:49:23.920 --> 3:49:29.440]  on his phone but and somebody over there can listen in on that end but they start trying to trace it
[3:49:29.440 --> 3:49:33.280]  back to figure out well who's it coming from they're essentially going to get it dead ended at our
[3:49:33.280 --> 3:49:37.360]  data center because that it's encrypted completely from your device to our data center where we connect
[3:49:37.360 --> 3:49:42.000]  to the regular toko network but we don't have any record that you actually made that call
[3:49:42.000 --> 3:49:47.360]  and this is the this is the real revolution explain that this is so huge i mean it's it's
[3:49:47.360 --> 3:49:52.800]  just it's a very simple philosophy called ignorance by design we don't want to know
[3:49:52.800 --> 3:49:57.680]  we don't want any records you know any records that yeah and they can't say you're a bad because
[3:49:57.680 --> 3:50:02.560]  why should you exactly why should you know what they're saying you're doing exactly you know
[3:50:02.560 --> 3:50:07.760]  the world over the last 10 years has been transformed by what they call the surveillance
[3:50:07.760 --> 3:50:12.320]  capitalism you know giving you free services and then taking all your data you know if you're not
[3:50:12.320 --> 3:50:17.920]  paying for the product you are the product right that's we're basically the counter to that paradigm
[3:50:17.920 --> 3:50:21.760]  we're saying you know what we're going to charge you a reasonable fee thirty nine ninety nine for
[3:50:21.760 --> 3:50:26.160]  unlimited talk text and high speed data plus all these privacy features that's less than most people
[3:50:26.160 --> 3:50:31.120]  are paying for their mobile subscriptions today you know so so we're charging you a reasonable fee
[3:50:31.120 --> 3:50:35.440]  we don't have any ads we don't collect any data so we can't sell it and the government can't
[3:50:35.440 --> 3:50:40.000]  demand it from us and hackers can't steal it you know so the focus here is you know you should
[3:50:40.000 --> 3:50:44.560]  be willing to pay kind of what you pay for your mobile service today to get all of these benefits
[3:50:44.560 --> 3:50:50.400]  of having security and privacy and not having to worry about you know apple or google or anybody
[3:50:50.400 --> 3:50:54.880]  else tracking you know i mean i can't say it enough david this is the revolution
[3:50:54.880 --> 3:51:00.960]  but companies not screwing you and selling your data and just charging you to give you anonymity
[3:51:00.960 --> 3:51:06.960]  not that you're bad but like i mean again i'm not bad but i was you know in bed with my wife
[3:51:06.960 --> 3:51:12.080]  last night nobody needs to be watching it it's my personal life yeah absolutely absolutely there's
[3:51:12.080 --> 3:51:16.800]  no reason anybody should know who did you talk to yesterday and how many times did you talk to them
[3:51:16.800 --> 3:51:21.040]  and what did you talk to them about you know you're at the doctor i would feel embarrassed if i was
[3:51:21.040 --> 3:51:25.440]  watching my neighbor over the fence yeah i mean like what's he saying to his wife what's he saying
[3:51:25.440 --> 3:51:30.400]  to his kids yeah it's crazy i interrupted you say no no that's okay it's crazy doctor you know i'll
[3:51:30.400 --> 3:51:33.280]  see if you're at the doctor's office and you get some news right what are you gonna do you're
[3:51:33.280 --> 3:51:37.440]  gonna call somebody you're gonna text somebody let him know what's going on right well hippo goes
[3:51:37.440 --> 3:51:41.120]  right out the window hippo is supposed to protect your medical privacy right but as soon as you send
[3:51:41.120 --> 3:51:45.920]  that as a text message to somebody or make a phone call to somebody about that guess what and that's
[3:51:45.920 --> 3:51:52.080]  on medical record that okay you just got diagnosed with whatever it was you sent it it's attached
[3:51:52.080 --> 3:51:57.760]  your id it's not a report exactly you know and it gets sold to brokers you know and these data
[3:51:57.760 --> 3:52:02.080]  brokers they'll sell that data to anybody they don't care what they're gonna do with it you know
[3:52:02.080 --> 3:52:05.920]  if you're lucky it's just an insurance company or you know somebody owns an apartment you want to
[3:52:05.920 --> 3:52:11.040]  rent trying to do a background check but the reality is you know last year these data brokers
[3:52:11.040 --> 3:52:15.360]  sold people's personal data to lots of different hacking groups there was one instance where they
[3:52:15.360 --> 3:52:19.840]  sold it to a vietnamese hacking group like 400 million records of people from around the world
[3:52:19.840 --> 3:52:24.000]  and these vietnamese people were all they were doing was identity theft you know that's crazy you
[3:52:24.000 --> 3:52:30.400]  know so uh so you just like you lock your door at nine just like you brush your teeth in the morning
[3:52:30.400 --> 3:52:36.400]  people need to become aware and they want to one shop one stop shop david to do this and then
[3:52:36.400 --> 3:52:41.440]  protect their identity protect their transactions protect their data absolutely absolutely you
[3:52:41.440 --> 3:52:44.800]  know we began with communications then we looked at internet activity then we said okay we got to
[3:52:44.800 --> 3:52:48.960]  stop the mobile providers from being able to collect all your data right so what's the next step well
[3:52:48.960 --> 3:52:54.480]  the next step for us is you know even if you're using our software and you've got an apple phone
[3:52:54.480 --> 3:53:00.240]  or an android phone what's happening well you know apple's getting information on you 52 times a day
[3:53:00.240 --> 3:53:04.640]  android's getting info you're sending information to google 350 times a day and we said you know
[3:53:04.640 --> 3:53:09.040]  what we've got to take the next step we've got to come out with our own volt to private phone
[3:53:09.040 --> 3:53:13.360]  and so that's where we developed the volt to private phone here so i'm gonna hand this over to you
[3:53:13.360 --> 3:53:18.560]  out it's been a while as soon as i guess this is just not launching it because the app i'm already
[3:53:18.560 --> 3:53:23.040]  using is great as soon as this is ready i want it when can i get the volt to phone so it's going
[3:53:23.040 --> 3:53:27.760]  to start shipping in may uh we're already taking pre-orders you can order it now you'll be one of
[3:53:27.760 --> 3:53:32.000]  the first people to get get one of them in may and so it's going to be shipping in may and the great
[3:53:32.000 --> 3:53:37.040]  thing about it is it's a secure piece of hardware manufactured in a secure facility so there's no
[3:53:37.040 --> 3:53:43.600]  zero day hacks we have a secure operating system it's android based though so you're getting secure
[3:53:43.600 --> 3:53:47.120]  operating system you know it's going to work because it's android based but unlike the android
[3:53:47.120 --> 3:53:51.120]  operating systems in most phones today we've completely de-googled it so we don't use any
[3:53:51.120 --> 3:53:56.240]  google services at all no connection to google whatsoever we provide our own software updates
[3:53:56.240 --> 3:54:00.960]  to it through our own platform we also have a secure app store so you're no longer going to the
[3:54:00.960 --> 3:54:04.960]  google play store you're going to be using what's called aurora it's essentially an app store where
[3:54:04.960 --> 3:54:10.560]  you can download any android app from the google uh play store without having to actually google
[3:54:10.560 --> 3:54:15.360]  know what that you've downloaded or what you've downloaded so so folks you want freedom they've
[3:54:15.360 --> 3:54:20.400]  made it easy with a few steps to really start taking control of your life your communication we've
[3:54:20.400 --> 3:54:25.200]  all got i'm going to do it you've got my commitment i'm getting off the uh apple i'm going back to
[3:54:25.200 --> 3:54:29.600]  droid we're doing it we've got to start taking control of our lives right now i gotta tell you
[3:54:29.600 --> 3:54:36.080]  it starts ed bolt a wireless dot com absolutely absolutely you know it's it's really uh at this
[3:54:36.080 --> 3:54:42.080]  point you know our focus our mission as a company is to help people take back their privacy help them
[3:54:42.080 --> 3:54:46.400]  have freedom be able to say what they want do what they want talk with whom they want you know freedom
[3:54:46.400 --> 3:54:50.720]  association freedom of speech it's so critical right without that you know there's there's really
[3:54:50.720 --> 3:54:54.320]  you're not going to get anything else and to get that you have to have privacy so we've talked about
[3:54:54.320 --> 3:54:58.960]  what we're doing today you know down the road our intention is to continue to add features so the
[3:54:58.960 --> 3:55:02.960]  ability to use your social media without your social media using you that's the next one on our
[3:55:02.960 --> 3:55:07.680]  roadmap you know everybody uses today zoom and microsoft teams and all of these things well
[3:55:07.680 --> 3:55:12.800]  if you read your zoom tombs assert terms of service they have access to every app on your device
[3:55:12.800 --> 3:55:17.120]  whenever you're using the zoom and again you're a great god david sinclair and this is all wonderful
[3:55:17.120 --> 3:55:22.720]  but just getting in the process of getting a safe phone learning how it works for all of us we've
[3:55:22.720 --> 3:55:28.240]  got to do it we can't just keep oh big tech you can monitor me you can surveil me whatever they are
[3:55:28.240 --> 3:55:34.160]  so scared of us taking control of our lives absolutely you know this is really going to be a
[3:55:34.160 --> 3:55:38.000]  huge disruption to the big tech business model you know their whole business model is about
[3:55:38.000 --> 3:55:43.040]  data collection you know it's about collecting everything they can on you they build a psychological
