[00:00.000 --> 00:25.000]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones.
[00:25.000 --> 00:33.000]  It was just two weeks ago that I got Paul Watson and Mike Adams on the phone, two really smart guys.
[00:33.000 --> 00:39.000]  And I said, the President needs our help.
[00:39.000 --> 00:42.000]  And America and the world needs our help.
[00:42.000 --> 00:44.000]  It falls to us.
[00:44.000 --> 00:50.000]  No one else has written a report on the full spectrum of the strangulation of free speech, not just here in the U.S.
[00:50.000 --> 00:56.000]  but in Europe that's being used to bring in this global tyranny.
[00:56.000 --> 00:59.000]  We have history on our side. We have the facts.
[00:59.000 --> 01:10.000]  And we can get this report directly into the President's hands, which within one day of it being published, the President was still in Europe
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.000]  and it was delivered to him on Air Force One.
[01:14.000 --> 01:17.000]  And the President did read the report.
[01:17.000 --> 01:24.000]  Now, the report was also given to Congressman Gates directly to him.
[01:24.000 --> 01:36.000]  And we asked him to expose the fact that I did not say anybody, I did not die at Parkland and that they were shadow banning everybody, including members of Congress.
[01:36.000 --> 01:45.000]  He responded by throwing me under the bus and saying that I did say nobody died and that companies have a right to ban and restrict whoever they want.
[01:45.000 --> 01:51.000]  Just don't promote killing congressmen.
[01:51.000 --> 01:53.000]  Remember those hearings last Tuesday.
[01:53.000 --> 01:56.000]  And then they shadow banned him.
[01:56.000 --> 02:08.000]  They took that as a green light and every other Republican in Congress other than John McCain.
[02:08.000 --> 02:18.000]  The President and Congress were all watching that hearing where the Republicans and Democrats made fools of themselves and had circles run around them by the heads of the tech companies.
[02:18.000 --> 02:27.000]  But there were other people watching and they were reading our report that was all bibliographed and they're taking action on our report.
[02:27.000 --> 02:34.000]  So, censor me, shut me down, whatever you're going to try, we just blew another death star.
[02:34.000 --> 02:38.000]  Let me tell you, the Domino's are going down on this now.
[02:38.000 --> 02:45.000]  Everybody knows I'm always on to the next battle and I don't get euphoria over winds, I don't get dopamine injections mentally.
[02:45.000 --> 02:48.000]  But I'm feeling really good right now.
[02:48.000 --> 02:56.000]  I was sitting there going over all this this morning and it just hit me that we fired torpedoes down the reactor shaft.
[02:56.000 --> 02:58.000]  You did it again.
[02:58.000 --> 02:59.000]  Paul Watson did it.
[02:59.000 --> 03:00.000]  Mike Adams did it.
[03:00.000 --> 03:01.000]  This whole crew did it.
[03:01.000 --> 03:03.000]  God did it.
[03:03.000 --> 03:11.000]  And I am just so happy because I can look at the tea leaves here.
[03:11.000 --> 03:13.000]  Yeah, yeah.
[03:13.000 --> 03:15.000]  And you're in a war.
[03:15.000 --> 03:18.000]  Use a naval Coral Sea analogy.
[03:18.000 --> 03:22.000]  And you've been looking for the Japanese for days and they've been finding you and attacking you.
[03:22.000 --> 03:30.000]  And finally, it's getting dark, but your planes find the Japanese task force and you just start blowing their ships up politically.
[03:30.000 --> 03:33.000]  We're not saying we're going to blow up Japanese ships.
[03:33.000 --> 03:34.000]  We'll put that out.
[03:34.000 --> 03:35.000]  It's an allegory.
[03:35.000 --> 03:38.000]  And I mean, right now, we had just found them.
[03:38.000 --> 03:39.000]  We just got over them.
[03:39.000 --> 03:48.000]  And the first bomb we dropped in the Info War to expose this Internet takeover, to expose the stealth, to expose how they're pushing it, how they're implementing it.
[03:48.000 --> 03:54.000]  The first bomb we dropped went right into the magazine of their main carrier and it just mushroomed.
[03:54.000 --> 03:58.000]  I mean, it is spectacular.
[03:58.000 --> 04:00.000]  Now, quite frankly, Shratton will just hit my plane.
[04:00.000 --> 04:03.000]  I got smoke coming out the back and I got a concussion.
[04:03.000 --> 04:09.000]  The explosion was so big, but I'm feeling real good with blurred political vision as I try to fly back and find my carrier.
[04:09.000 --> 04:15.000]  Because we just, I'm telling you, we just dropped a huge bomb right into the heart of their operation.
[04:15.000 --> 04:22.000]  You notice Facebook stock is plunging right now.
[04:22.000 --> 04:27.000]  I'm going to explain why that's happening when we come back.
[04:27.000 --> 04:29.000]  Massive endorsement flood.
[04:29.000 --> 04:30.000]  Whoa.
[04:30.000 --> 04:32.000]  Oh my God.
[04:32.000 --> 04:36.000]  My brain, my guts, my soul is saying, good job.
[04:36.000 --> 04:38.000]  God's saying, good job.
[04:38.000 --> 04:39.000]  I can feel it right now.
[04:39.000 --> 04:40.000]  Can't you feel it?
[04:40.000 --> 04:45.000]  I'm going to explain how devastating this is to the enemy.
[04:45.000 --> 04:52.000]  Oh, and the impeachment process has begun against Rosenstein as well.
[04:52.000 --> 04:58.000]  Oh, yeah.
[04:58.000 --> 05:26.000]  Direct hit.
[05:26.000 --> 05:39.000]  We're all
[05:39.000 --> 05:54.000]  coming back, and we might have a lot of questions.
[05:54.000 --> 05:59.000]  support recovery. Try the Info Wars Life Daily Digestive Pack today.
[06:07.000 --> 06:16.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the Info War and say, I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one!
[06:16.000 --> 06:23.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[06:23.000 --> 06:43.000]  You can pull up the article from a week and a half ago on InfoWars.com by Paul Joseph Watson. It's titled Emergency Report to the President and Congress Concerning the Discovered Blues.
[06:53.000 --> 07:03.000]  It's a blueprint for total internet censorship and the end of free speech in the United States and worldwide being carried out by stealth by major tech giants.
[07:04.000 --> 07:16.000]  There's also another posting that just has the Mike Adams Report in it titled Emergency Report, The Censorship Master Plan Decoded. And if you scroll down you can see right there the report.
[07:16.000 --> 07:25.000]  The censorship master plan decoded that was delivered to the President of the United States about eight days ago.
[07:27.000 --> 07:33.000]  There it is. And right on time, we put the report out on a Friday.
[07:33.000 --> 07:48.000]  Right on time they had the hearings the next Tuesday and admitted it at all. And Congress then went and looked and found out all the Republicans were shadow banned, except for John McCain, and that all the Democrats were being promoted.
[07:49.000 --> 07:51.000]  And the President found out that he was shadow banned.
[07:52.000 --> 07:57.000]  Finally, I got the report to the President thanks to Patriots, and I'll leave it at that.
[07:57.000 --> 08:05.000]  But let's just say General Kelly isn't too happy. He'll be gone in about four days, we're told, in five days.
[08:06.000 --> 08:21.000]  So, yes, I think the Patriots are in the henhouse, aren't they? The Foxes don't like that too much. The farmer is getting back into the winehouse. The farmer don't like foxes with little hens.
[08:21.000 --> 08:26.000]  So, you see what's going on, ladies and gentlemen.
[08:27.000 --> 08:34.000]  And you see what's happening. We've got our big petition up. It's getting a lot of attention to stop shadow banning at change.org.
[08:35.000 --> 08:42.000]  We're going to be breaking that down. But you're not going to be told about the victories we're having. They're not going to be told about the victories you're having.
[08:42.000 --> 08:54.000]  In fact, you're going to see intensified attacks on Info Wars because there is literal and figurative bounties on this operation and on yours truly.
[08:55.000 --> 09:00.000]  They have taken the level of lies to a new level that I'm going to be breaking down today as well.
[09:01.000 --> 09:07.000]  Forbes and others are reporting that my YouTube videos are taken down and they're set to ban the channel.
[09:07.000 --> 09:17.000]  It's a big national news story to set the precedent because I attacked a 11-year-old child and that I threw them to the ground.
[09:18.000 --> 09:23.000]  Now, this is just completely insane and not true, but they know because the video was taken down.
[09:24.000 --> 09:30.000]  They know because the video was taken down that, oh, people can't see it.
[09:30.000 --> 09:36.000]  So we can just say whatever we want and now the new thing is he endangers children.
[09:37.000 --> 09:43.000]  I bet Congressman Gates will have another hearing in a few months and he'll Facebook and Twitter and YouTube will say, yes, Jones beats children up on video.
[09:44.000 --> 09:50.000]  And Gates will say, well, that's terrible. We'll have to ban him immediately until he found out he was shadow ban.
[09:51.000 --> 09:58.000]  And of course, it's not true. We showed the viral video that had been all over national news of a teenager attacking an adult.
[09:58.000 --> 10:03.000]  And the adult finally pushes him down the ground. Then he gets back up and actually isn't hurt.
[10:04.000 --> 10:10.000]  So everybody else can have that video. We can't show it to you, even though it's all on ABC, NBC, CBS News.
[10:14.000 --> 10:17.000]  But then we get banned and then they tell you that I beat up a child.
[10:18.000 --> 10:23.000]  So lies on lies on lies. And I'll have somebody probably walk up on the street and go, how dare you beat up that 11-year-old?
[10:23.000 --> 10:34.000]  I'll be like, I didn't shut up, Russian. You're going to prison, Russian. Well, I'm not a Russian agent.
[10:35.000 --> 10:39.000]  I didn't push a kid to the ground. I showed a video that was on ABC News National.
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.000]  They had big headlines and Rolling Stone. You know, this video is causing an internet debate.
[10:44.000 --> 10:50.000]  Was it right that this kid had been beating people up out in the parking lot and attacking adults and punched this man in the face three times?
[10:50.000 --> 10:53.000]  And the adult pushes him down and they go, no, Disable is never right.
[10:57.000 --> 11:01.000]  So that's what they're doing, folks.
[11:02.000 --> 11:06.000]  And it's just like they say, Trump says he hates all Mexicans and they're all rapists. There's no video of that.
[11:07.000 --> 11:10.000]  He said there are a lot of criminals coming across the border. We got a vet who's coming across.
[11:11.000 --> 11:17.000]  There are a lot of criminals. Some of them rapists. That turns into all Mexicans are rapists. It's just not true.
[11:17.000 --> 11:26.000]  They misrepresent everything. I say, it's an allegory, you know, a political analogy of we're at high noon with Robert Mueller and the globalists in the deep state.
[11:27.000 --> 11:32.000]  And it's a death battle. That's what they call it. That doesn't mean a literal death battle. It means no quarter to the end.
[11:33.000 --> 11:39.000]  And so I said, I'm here at high noon, you know, they go, Jones said he's going to kill him and, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[11:39.000 --> 11:50.000]  When the last thing I want is Mueller to be turned into a martyr. I want him to be absolutely discredited along with the whole deep state and defeated and return our Republic and have prosperity and justice again.
[11:51.000 --> 11:56.000]  And the good name at the FBI, back. That's what I want. But see, they misrepresent everything.
[11:57.000 --> 12:03.000]  And you always notice it's a real blurry video on CNN or MSNBC and it'll show it on the screen behind them to cover the jump cut edits.
[12:03.000 --> 12:12.000]  Amazing. And of course, Facebook and YouTube look at it and they go, well, actually he didn't say he's literally going to do it.
[12:13.000 --> 12:20.000]  He said it was figurative. Just like when I said earlier, exposing Internet censorship and having a real national debate about it will bring it down.
[12:21.000 --> 12:27.000]  It's like blowing up the Death Star victory for the rebels. I'm not looking for a Death Star. I don't think it's real. I'm not going to blow it up.
[12:27.000 --> 12:36.000]  I'm playing spaghetti Western music in the background saying, Mueller, we're going to take you down high noon in the information war.
[12:37.000 --> 12:52.000]  Politically, we're going to, you know, I mean, that's like, again, like seeing a football game, the Red River Shootout where UT and Oklahoma meet halfway in Dallas from Oklahoma City and or Norman, Norman and Austin.
[12:52.000 --> 13:02.000]  And they meet in Dallas at the Cotton Bowl and they go, there's the big Red River Shootout. People even have little toy rubber guns and stuff. We're not actually going to shoot anybody.
[13:03.000 --> 13:12.000]  But this is how they deceive you. Headline, Jones endangered a child. Jones beat up a little boy. Kid wasn't beat up.
[13:12.000 --> 13:24.000]  Happened in what, Indiana? I had nothing to do with it. It's been on national news, but see, they know you're reading their article and they won't show you the video because it's been taken down, even though it turns out they had the video.
[13:25.000 --> 13:29.000]  But Forbes and others say, I beat up the little boy.
[13:29.000 --> 13:41.000]  You'll have an year old punk that's running around reportedly beat up other kids, was attacking adults, starts punching this guy in the face three times. The guy finally pushes him down.
[13:42.000 --> 13:52.000]  And now because of that, I am facing the end of my free speech. That is hoaxing. That is fraud. That is mainstream media.
[13:52.000 --> 14:00.000]  Now let me stop right there. Let me give you the gigantic trillion ton enchilada here. We're going to come back from breaking and get into it all.
[14:01.000 --> 14:13.000]  No one had written a comprehensive blueprint of the tech companies and their admissions with exhibits, video, audio, text, internal documents, Google documents, we've got it all.
[14:13.000 --> 14:24.000]  About how they were going to first shut down info wars and then set the president to ban everybody else. And now today they're saying we want Fox News banned.
[14:25.000 --> 14:34.000]  The Democratic Party, major public events are happening and they're officially now calling for Fox to be banned off the internet. See, there's no end to this.
[14:34.000 --> 14:47.000]  They want the president banned on Twitter. He's already shadow banned. So the fact that we got our report to the president, 50 something pages, Mike Adams, Paul Watson did a lot of legwork, put out the articles.
[14:48.000 --> 14:57.000]  You did the legwork as listeners and viewers in the game on the field in the arena. And we just had a huge victory because no one had a blueprint till then.
[14:57.000 --> 15:07.000]  So every member of that board, every member of that House judiciary had a hardcover delivered to them. We had it delivered to their offices.
[15:08.000 --> 15:16.000]  We made phone calls ourselves. We told listeners and put a list of their emails out and said hit all of them and every member of Congress. I made sure it got to the president.
[15:16.000 --> 15:27.000]  They're good patriots are listening right now. I'm not going to even say where I'm going to say what area and but I contacted three sources.
[15:28.000 --> 15:34.000]  So that could closely the president and two of them said we got it to one of them gave me the specifics.
[15:34.000 --> 15:47.000]  So the president had it delivered in to his hands on Air Force One. Just as I envisioned. It's not that hard to win if you take action and you have the research into the work.
[15:48.000 --> 15:57.000]  And now the dominoes are falling because they started massively censoring Congress the next week right on time proving it all. And now they've got the lawmakers pissed and ready to act.

[20:16.000 --> 20:38.000]  By the way, I've been having some celebratory breakdown here that Congress is finally waking up, the America is waking up to how we're being censored, the takeover plan.
[20:38.000 --> 20:47.000]  They've been doing it incrementally so we were like a frog in boiling water but now it's reached boil, we either get out or we die. We lose the First Amendment like Europe's lost their free speech.
[20:48.000 --> 21:02.000]  That said, YouTube has banned us live streaming, not just on channels that info wars runs, but even sub channels that crew members set up that we'd used as backups.
[21:02.000 --> 21:09.000]  So they're not even following their own rules at this point. They do not want us reaching millions of people every week over live streams on YouTube.
[21:10.000 --> 21:14.000]  They want us shut down ahead of 2018. The election's only three months out, folks.
[21:15.000 --> 21:27.000]  I have a stack of news of congressional candidates, of congressmen, of congresswomen who are putting out their campaign videos on Facebook, Twitter and YouTube and being banned.
[21:27.000 --> 21:42.000]  Okay? Members of Congress, whether shooting shotguns and talking about their family or where it's a grandma, a congresswoman from Tennessee talking about her grandkids and talking about how they're endorsed by the NRA.
[21:43.000 --> 21:47.000]  It's all being banned and they're setting a precedent with Alex Jones.
[21:47.000 --> 22:00.000]  And I watched congressman Gates, he was briefed on this by, I'm sure everybody can guess who, the guy that helped get him elected, Roger Stone and myself.
[22:01.000 --> 22:09.000]  And we tried to get Gates to champion this. It's super popular, it's constitutional, it's important, it's critical.
[22:10.000 --> 22:14.000]  He didn't have to sit there and defend me. He just had to go, wait a minute, you had to restore Alex Jones' channel.
[22:14.000 --> 22:19.000]  Turned out he didn't say nobody died at Parkland. That was fake. Plus he'd have the right to do that if he wanted to, but he didn't.
[22:20.000 --> 22:28.000]  No, he knew all that and he kissed their butt in the meeting and said, as long as you don't let them say kill Republicans, you're allowed to take off whoever you want, you're a private corporation.
[22:29.000 --> 22:33.000]  Well, they never advertise themselves as that. They advertise as a utility. The CIA helps set up Google.
[22:34.000 --> 22:41.000]  This is how people communicate now. So you're saying we just don't have access, like Jews didn't have access to Nazi Germany to the market at first.
[22:41.000 --> 22:50.000]  That's how the censorship starts. So I was, there he was, chairing the committee. We got a report to the president. We got the report to him. He knew.
[22:51.000 --> 22:56.000]  And then he found out he was shadow banned along with all the other Republicans that checked.
[22:59.000 --> 23:05.000]  You've been banned for a long time. I know your dad's a billionaire and, you know, you're, you're, you're, you're rich, you're rich and everything.
[23:05.000 --> 23:10.000]  That's fine, dude. But now you have to become self made. You have to defend the country.
[23:11.000 --> 23:17.000]  You can't just sit up there and swim around with the Democrats and think you're going to be left alone with the takeover of the Internet and that you won't be censored.
[23:18.000 --> 23:20.000]  By the way, that's the calculation dumb ass made.
[23:24.000 --> 23:26.000]  That's the calculation he made.
[23:26.000 --> 23:36.000]  Is that, oh, they'll let him get the Joneses and the drudges of the world will be okay. We'll go along with this. We'll be left online.
[23:37.000 --> 23:42.000]  That's what they told everybody. That's what they've told all the other Ben Shapiro's of the world. Now they're getting censored. No.
[23:44.000 --> 23:46.000]  They eat you last fools.
[23:46.000 --> 23:56.000]  Matt drudge gets this. He's the only guy that would even report the truth three months ago when they banned our YouTube channel and put a bunch of strikes on it and froze it.
[23:57.000 --> 24:06.000]  And we couldn't show you the real videos on the channel and they said a bunch of things I didn't say, but drudge linked to our videos and they got 14 million views on, on info wars.com.
[24:07.000 --> 24:12.000]  And everybody went, wow, you didn't say they were crisis actors or nobody died. You said that the police stood down, which we broke.
[24:12.000 --> 24:22.000]  It was the kids saying, and that hadn't been in the news yet. They didn't want that out. That's why they banned our YouTube channel, froze it three days after because, because you, they didn't want it out.
[24:23.000 --> 24:36.000]  The police stood down, which is now confirmed. So see, have their cake and eat it too. Say I said something I didn't say, set the precedent to ban free speech and then strangle the free speech and then strangle everybody else's free speech.
[24:36.000 --> 24:49.000]  This is free speech. The really big news is in the next segment because I'm explaining why Facebook is plunging. And I said this was coming and we have the exclusive of why it's plunging and who's going to plunge next.
[24:49.000 --> 25:05.000]  How low will it go when it was low as 20 points down now it's 18% down. He's lost 16 plus billion dollars today. By the way, Zuckerberg is not a big a villain as Apple. They are the really wicked people.
[25:05.000 --> 25:20.000]  When it comes to real evil action with China and oppressing their workers and everything, they are just Uber bad hombres. And I'm not trying to just say Zuckerberg some angel cake. They've already been censoring us.
[25:21.000 --> 25:33.000]  So his claim that, oh, I'm not taking Alex Jones down. He's the less free speech. That's bull. It's like saying, oh, we're not putting you in prison. We're just putting you on house arrest in a jail cell the size of a bathroom.
[25:33.000 --> 25:46.000]  They already censoring everybody 90 plus percent. I told everybody this coming up next segment. I'm going to break down what's really happening. But the result, I should have opened the broadcast up with this.
[25:46.000 --> 26:05.000]  The result of our report getting the president in Congress, the big tech giants arrogantly accelerating their censorship from, you know, 50, 60% of conservative posts being blocked or shadow banned. Now it's over 90% because they're scared they're going to lose the election in the battle to take back Congress.
[26:05.000 --> 26:19.000]  So they can defeat our beachhead and start impeachment process. Trump now understands he's been shadow banned in the report. It explains how he's banned and gives him websites he can go to her staff can to show how he's shadow banned where you can track it and it breaks it down.
[26:20.000 --> 26:32.000]  Now the process is happening of getting visual on this and people seeing the report and then seeing it manifest in live time because they turn the censorship up the very week after the report came out.
[26:32.000 --> 26:46.000]  Because we knew it was all about to intensify because the election. They said they were going to intensify the left is everywhere saying banned Fox ban Trump ban Alex Jones ban everything ban free speech just like the universities they're making their move.
[26:46.000 --> 27:01.000]  They're launching their offensive against the most cherished system of our freedom the First Amendment. It's here. It's authoritarian. It's nakedly corrupt. It's out of control. It's illegal. It's racketeering. It's organized crime.
[27:01.000 --> 27:19.000]  And all those members of Google Facebook and Twitter they lied to Congress. Big time. They said oh we only shadow ban violent or hateful or whatever post. No you don't. You put a governor on it of 90 plus percent.
[27:19.000 --> 27:35.000]  Paul's governor is 97%. He was number one on Twitter for actual responses above the BBC for three years running. He was number one. And how do they respond. 97% collar on me.
[27:35.000 --> 27:49.000]  He still gets like 10 15,000 retweets. A restraining collar like a shock collar. 97% demonetization of his YouTube channel. 97% shadow ban.
[27:49.000 --> 28:04.000]  Doesn't have all the fake followers only got 893,000 followers but he had the highest Twitter response of any news organization in the world until the restraining collar went on.
[28:04.000 --> 28:19.000]  Oh we didn't ban you. You just can't talk to anybody. We didn't take your free speech. We just buried you in the bottom of a pyramid somewhere. Maybe God can hear you but nobody else can. Bye bye. Enjoy the Phantom Zone.
[28:19.000 --> 28:33.000]  Point by eyes. Point by eyes. Like he's like General Zod. Here we'll just freeze you. Bye bye Watson. You're not dead. You're just frozen for a trillion years. Bye bye.
[28:33.000 --> 28:48.000]  President knows and now the tumblers are going into place and now we're energizing but we're getting hit really hard here on the front line which is fine. I just think you might want to support us to spread the word. We are verboten. We're the number one enemy and everybody should understand that to celebrate

[33:53.000 --> 34:08.000]  You are not the president. No one who leads so many could possibly kneel so quickly.
[34:08.000 --> 34:23.000]  I'm the man they're protecting. I'm the president.
[34:38.000 --> 34:51.000]  So here's where we are. They are having major international television media meetings. I'm going to go to now calling for Fox News to be de-platformed.
[34:51.000 --> 35:08.000]  They are calling for the president to be killed all over the news. No one's getting in trouble for it. They're trying to sabotage the Korean peace deal. They're trying to sabotage the economy.
[35:08.000 --> 35:21.000]  Shadow Band, not letting libertarians, conservatives, nationalists communicate with each other and then not even telling you they've done it and then lying about it to Congress.
[35:22.000 --> 35:29.000]  When we have all their own documents, Veritas video, their own admissions, their own policy reports that have been leaked to us, we put it in the report to the president.
[35:29.000 --> 35:38.000]  And then they're so pigheaded they intensify the shadow banning and so members of Congress start checking to see if they're shadow banned because there are big websites that do it for you now.
[35:39.000 --> 35:52.000]  And they find out that they're dialed back 90% on average. And then all these members of Congress are trying to run their TV ads. Democrats are allowed to run theirs and then they put it on their Facebook and Facebook goes, oh, no political ads allowed of conservatives.
[35:52.000 --> 36:08.000]  The NRA is being told they can't run ads now. And so you see, I'm answering the big secret question of everybody. Why is Facebook plunging? I'm going to explain it in a moment, but think about it.
[36:08.000 --> 36:23.000]  The NFL's got about 45% ratings reduction the last three years. World Cup's down, it's gotten political, 40% as well. Hollywood's money making, even with inflation added ends down 30%, 40%.
[36:24.000 --> 36:36.000]  All the major cable news shows have audiences that local talk radio has bigger audiences. One hit show like in a town like Chicago has more listeners in three hours than CNN has in three hours.
[36:36.000 --> 36:49.000]  CNN is like government cheese or something. No one wants to eat it. It's like this thing that just flickers. You know, they pay to have it in bars. They pay to have it in airports.
[36:50.000 --> 36:57.000]  They force feed it in every public school in the country. I know of little boil down 15 minutes of BS every first period.
[36:57.000 --> 37:08.000]  Ryan Stelter and the young people are all totally rebelling. They've got info wars on their book bags. Literally. And Stelter and them, they know this.
[37:09.000 --> 37:13.000]  That's why they want to shut down because they're driving around the middle of nowhere. They see an info or sticker.
[37:13.000 --> 37:27.000]  That was in the middle of Nebraska by the Platte River and there was info wars, homemade sticker on a light pole. 30 miles outside Omaha.
[37:28.000 --> 37:33.000]  I walked into this little gas station and there were two Indian Americans behind the counter, a man and woman. They were both listeners.
[37:33.000 --> 37:46.000]  I mean, oh, I just saw info or sticker a mile away. I walk in the two Indian Americans. They're listeners. I mean, they can't deal with this because everybody knows we're the verboten.
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  So what are they going to do? What they're trying.
[37:52.000 --> 37:57.000]  Now, here it is. This is everything we've been looking for right here.
[37:57.000 --> 38:04.000]  The president to wake up to the internet takeover and the bullying of conservatives, libertarians, everything that I asked you to promote.
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  I asked you to get the report out last week. You did it.
[38:08.000 --> 38:17.000]  And now you can send the report out to everybody, you know, and say, here's the report. They don't want you to read the censorship master plan decoded.
[38:18.000 --> 38:23.000]  And there's a little blurb article that hasn't linked in an emergency report. The censorship master plan decoded.
[38:23.000 --> 38:32.000]  That's the Mike Adams report. Guys, I want the Paul Watson report that boils it down. That came out the same day. I want to give people that article.
[38:33.000 --> 38:34.000]  That's the most critical thing I've been needing since the start of the show.
[38:35.000 --> 38:38.000]  Now, so I want people to now be able to go get this.
[38:43.000 --> 38:44.000]  Because here's the president.
[38:44.000 --> 38:52.000]  Twitter shadow banning that term. Now the president put it out there just like Trump derangement syndrome. We've been talking about it for two years.
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  Now the president talks about it. Now it's everywhere.
[38:56.000 --> 38:59.000]  So it just got amplified by the big guy by the boss.
[39:00.000 --> 39:05.000]  Twitter quote shadow banning all caps prominent Republicans. Not good.
[39:06.000 --> 39:10.000]  We will look into this discriminatory and illegal practice at once. Many complaints.
[39:10.000 --> 39:17.000]  And then we've got our 50 plus page report delivered to the president.
[39:18.000 --> 39:24.000]  The emergency report to Congress and the president on the blueprint for total internet censorship.
[39:25.000 --> 39:30.000]  The takeover and how to counter the takeover info wars.com at the next break.
[39:31.000 --> 39:36.000]  I'm going to retweet the Paul Watson article. That's the best boil down. Then it has a report in it at real Alex Jones.
[39:36.000 --> 39:42.000]  And despite their shadow banning, you can show people at work. Hey, I'm going to send this to your Twitter.
[39:43.000 --> 39:47.000]  And almost all of you won't be able to do it and show them that go out in that funny. They don't want you to about a report.
[39:48.000 --> 39:54.000]  But see, that's what makes it catch fire. That's what makes it so explosive. That's what makes it so exciting.
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  That's what's so powerful about all of this.
[39:57.000 --> 40:03.000]  That's what's so exciting about all of this because it is illegal. It is racketeering.
[40:04.000 --> 40:09.000]  It is a mass discriminatory practice and they've been caught lying about it to Congress and it's all coming unraveled.
[40:10.000 --> 40:17.000]  Now, why is Facebook plunging 20% today? Zuckerberg himself losing 16 billion.
[40:18.000 --> 40:21.000]  I'll cover it in the next segment, but I'll give you the answer now 100%.
[40:21.000 --> 40:27.000]  And no one else is even saying this. The media is spinning it and saying, oh, it's because they won't kick hate off or whatever.
[40:28.000 --> 40:37.000]  No, it's because the left one after Cambridge Analytica, which was doing public legal scraping.
[40:38.000 --> 40:46.000]  And what Facebook does is a thousand times more insane, just like the NSA, the same type, just private NSA that you opt into.
[40:46.000 --> 40:51.000]  But then facecans and nexus is everybody and creates these these panopticon control systems.
[40:52.000 --> 40:55.000]  It's a giant opt into the NSA snooper bug.
[40:56.000 --> 41:07.000]  Now, the left went after Republicans scraping it using low level technology to reach voters because they didn't want them to have a slingshot to fight Goliath.
[41:07.000 --> 41:21.000]  And so when they did that, it's so amazing when they pulled that, then that exposed all the illegal stuff that was many times worse.
[41:22.000 --> 41:31.000]  And so that wounded the whole model of privatized NSA data mining and control and social engineering, but that's not what finished it.
[41:31.000 --> 41:42.000]  Facebook knows that conservatives and libertarians in general have about 90% of middle class money.
[41:43.000 --> 41:46.000]  There's a report out today that Democrats have like, you know, 70% of the billionaire money.
[41:47.000 --> 41:50.000]  But for people that actually buy things and do things, the market is conservatives and Christians and people.
[41:50.000 --> 42:00.000]  So they made Zuckerberg kill Facebook, just like News Corp killed Myspace.
[42:01.000 --> 42:04.000]  They made him kill the company by not letting conservatives communicate.
[42:05.000 --> 42:13.000]  They all left when you shadow banned 90% of conservative and Christian and pro gun and pro America and internal documents, you know, YouTube and Facebook and Google.
[42:14.000 --> 42:17.000]  Well, what do you ban anything Alex Jones, anything American flags, anything veterans.
[42:17.000 --> 42:21.000]  Okay, that's a lot. Anything Trump.
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  So they banned all that. They killed it.
[42:25.000 --> 42:29.000]  They took a shotgun that was aimed at our head and pointed at their feet and Zuckerberg said, this is going to hurt.
[42:30.000 --> 42:34.000]  And they said, do it. And he blew his feet off and the company's feet off and they're bleeding to death right now.
[42:35.000 --> 42:36.000]  They wouldn't put a tourniquet on it.
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  And in meanwhile, that people like, weren't you worried about getting censored?
[42:40.000 --> 42:41.000]  I said, watch this.
[42:41.000 --> 42:46.000]  We got roots that are deep. We knew this was coming. We're not dependent on them.
[42:47.000 --> 42:53.000]  They're killing themselves to stand back and watch this just like the NFL.
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.000]  It's in Hollywood. It's all imploding all by their own stupid design.
[42:59.000 --> 43:02.000]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[43:03.000 --> 43:09.000]  Info Wars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower and sink in your home.

[45:53.000 --> 46:00.000]  Thanks to your support and your prayers together, we're changing the world. Now it's time to change our bodies with a z-shield at infowarslife.com.
[46:00.000 --> 46:06.000]  Patrick in the great nation of Australia, you're on the air worldwide. Thanks for holding.
[46:30.000 --> 46:37.000]  Thanks to you, the super male vitality, the caveman, the real red pill, micro z-x body, it's all amazing. Thank you brother.
[46:38.000 --> 46:50.000]  Yeah and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit and it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, the more you chase God.
[46:50.000 --> 47:00.000]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[47:03.000 --> 47:06.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:06.000 --> 47:29.000]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[47:29.000 --> 47:36.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:40.000 --> 47:54.000]  When historians look back on the Trump presidency, they'll say that this was the week that something changed, something really shifted in the conversations about the president, uncomfortable questions moved into the mainstream in a big way.
[47:54.000 --> 48:13.000]  Trump's odd behavior with Vladimir Putin is compelling so many people to ask, what does Putin have on Trump? Has Trump been compromised? All of those people, those experts, those reporters, they are looking at the fact pattern and they're seeing something strange, even something sinister.
[48:13.000 --> 48:20.000]  We'll give you everything you need.
[48:21.000 --> 48:28.000]  Man, I tell you, the attacks on Info Wars have gone supernova.
[48:28.000 --> 48:52.000]  I just learned during the break that they've done a filing at Travis County and are going to attempt to strip my children from me because Forbes says I beat up an 11-year-old kid and posted a video of it when I had leaked to an ABC news piece months ago and Darren McBrain did a promo of it of the little punk, 11-year-old punching the guy or 12-year-old punching the guy in the face.
[48:52.000 --> 49:02.000]  He finally pushes them down in another state. I'll show you the article. They don't care. They're going with it in the news that I beat a kid up and trying to take my kids today.
[49:03.000 --> 49:16.000]  I just confirmed it. I meant to go off air and go down to the Travis County courthouse right now. I mean, this is what the Democrats have turned into, man, because they say I beat a kid up or they say Trump hates Mexicans. There's no video of them ever saying that.
[49:16.000 --> 49:30.000]  We've all got to just go to hell. Man, these people are next level. You know what? I'm not even going to go to court. People want to go into court and do that stuff and put that out. You know what?
[49:30.000 --> 49:47.000]  Whatever. Imagine they take my kids because of Forbes saying that. That just shows in the left door, man. If they can't abort all your babies, they're so pissed that they'll try to take them away from me. They've been trying that for so long with the media lying and all the stuff they've done and taking stuff out of context.
[49:48.000 --> 49:51.000]  Unbelievable. Wow.
[49:51.000 --> 50:02.000]  So pray for M4s, folks. Mark Dice has done an out of this world funny piece on Brian Stelter and Stelter blocked it and tried to have it removed and all the rest of it. It just shows what authoritarian these people are.
[50:03.000 --> 50:10.000]  But getting back to Zuckerberg, I mean, Facebook is a giant pump and dump and it's a giant spy grit.
[50:10.000 --> 50:23.000]  And now that the left tried to expose Cambridge Analytica for doing public scraping, just going out and getting names of who affiliate themselves as conservatives or pro-Trump and then reach out to them and mobilize them.
[50:24.000 --> 50:37.000]  Public scraping. You put something out in public, it's going to get scraped. That is nothing compared to what Facebook actually does and how they admitted that they worked for the Democratic Party and the Globalist and Merkel and the EU.
[50:37.000 --> 50:53.000]  And he's on record. So the left wanted to stop Republicans from publicly data mining so they killed the whole Golden Goose or at least wounded it by exposing the fact that, well, if that's bad, what they did, what you do is literally a thousand times.
[50:53.000 --> 51:06.000]  When I say a thousand, I mean, what Facebook does compares to like what they did at Cambridge Analytica is like a million, a billion. I don't know. I mean, it's so much bigger. It's like a grain of sand compared to a mountain.
[51:07.000 --> 51:17.000]  There's not even really a way for me to try to even describe this. So you've got the NFL killing itself with all the kneeling and the America hating. They can't help it. The Globalists are giving them orders to do it.
[51:17.000 --> 51:33.000]  Hollywood 30, 40 percent down. They can't stop. All of these leftist universities like Missouri State and Evergreen have 15 to 30 percent in the last two years enrollment down.
[51:34.000 --> 51:44.000]  I mean, people are like, I'm not going to pay 15, $20,000 a year for my kid to be taught to hate America. And if they're white, they can't go to school on certain days to teach them what it's like. They didn't do anything.
[51:44.000 --> 51:53.000]  I mean, this is crazy. And so. But that's it. The big mega banks are global. They don't care about a university. They don't care about the NFL.
[51:54.000 --> 52:03.000]  They will order them to do this and they will do it. Even if it destroys their franchises, even if it destroys the NFL, destroys Hollywood, because who owns Hollywood?
[52:03.000 --> 52:16.000]  The big six, even the Wall Street Journal reports, the big six production houses, studios are controlling interest, Chinese government.
[52:17.000 --> 52:24.000]  And people hear that. They don't believe. They go, look up. They go, that's true. Yeah. Who's owned our majority of our debt for seven years?
[52:24.000 --> 52:35.000]  Jack Oms, man. Jack Oms. I mean, we're far down the road here. So when I get excited, it's because the patient looks like it might come back to life.
[52:36.000 --> 52:40.000]  The pulse is better. Kind of the patients woke up, but we're still in bad shape here.
[52:43.000 --> 52:52.000]  And they're trying to get Trump and in full wars and anybody else that's pro America and pro free market out of there so they can get in there and smother the patient with a big old pillow.
[52:52.000 --> 52:59.000]  And so that's where we are right now. So look, we want to take action in this world.
[53:00.000 --> 53:05.000]  There's strategic things you can do. There's strategic things you can do.
[53:06.000 --> 53:12.000]  And getting the report to the president, getting it to Congress saying, see, here's a report on shadow betting.
[53:13.000 --> 53:17.000]  We just retweeted it at real Alex Jones. We're going to retweet it at Paul's Prison Planet Twitter.
[53:17.000 --> 53:21.000]  Get it out there. Send it out your email. Say, Hey, this is what the president's looking at.
[53:22.000 --> 53:29.000]  Get Paul Watson's boil down report of it. If you don't want to read 50 pages. Emergency big text plot to kill free speech revealed.
[53:30.000 --> 53:35.000]  I mean, this is to use the Death Star analogy again of episode four Star Wars.
[53:36.000 --> 53:42.000]  This is the X-wing and this is the torpedoes. You've got to get in the X-wing and you've got to fly the trench.
[53:42.000 --> 53:46.000]  You don't have to actually risk your life. Just get the word out and take some action.
[53:47.000 --> 53:52.000]  And enough that you fire this information. This is coffin nails of censorship. This is it.
[53:53.000 --> 53:58.000]  And we also have to know they're going to spin it. Oh, Facebook's in trouble because of the haters.
[53:59.000 --> 54:06.000]  That has nothing to do with it. That's the bullying of the shareholders to get them in line for censorship when it's the censorship that's killing Facebook.
[54:06.000 --> 54:13.000]  100%. So you need to reach out to the shareholders. If Facebook would be a good company and bring some value and, you know, actually let people communicate.
[54:14.000 --> 54:17.000]  That could be their business model advertising instead of data money.
[54:18.000 --> 54:24.000]  So I don't want to just destroy things. Like we have an enemy, you know, a castle that we've captured. We're not going to blow it up.
[54:25.000 --> 54:33.000]  I mean, it's our castle now. I want the castle to do well. I like building things, but you're not going to use this stuff on us.
[54:33.000 --> 54:39.000]  Like, have you figured it out yet? We're smart. We're aggressive. Not just me, people like me. We are fighting you now.
[54:40.000 --> 54:45.000]  We used to be asleep. You thought we were intimidated. You thought we were under your control. No, we were asleep.
[54:46.000 --> 54:55.000]  Now, the more you do to bully us and attack us does not scare me. I mean, I know the worst things get for me is the mission.
[54:55.000 --> 55:05.000]  And so it's, it's, I'm actually very blessed. This persecution has been the best thing in my life and it's really made me a better person.
[55:06.000 --> 55:11.000]  And I just thank God for what God's done. I just, I just, God has always, you learn God's mysteries. You learn how God works.
[55:12.000 --> 55:16.000]  You just want to know more of it. You're like, Oh, this is really a man. Oh, wow. Oh, I see this whole thing now.
[55:16.000 --> 55:25.000]  And I see the plans and the wheels within wheels. And I just, Oh, it's so beautiful and good. And I just, I just want to be with that spirit forever.
[55:26.000 --> 55:32.000]  And so if I've got to go through some pain so that we have a future, that's a great thing. Isn't it?
[55:33.000 --> 55:39.000]  And everybody's afraid to be bullied or afraid to be called out by evil people or slaves. That's a good thing.
[55:39.000 --> 55:46.000]  You don't think in World War II when there was Japanese and Nazi propaganda against America, you don't think our soldiers believe that, do you?
[55:47.000 --> 55:53.000]  They knew it was a load of crap. And once you get into that mindset about mainstream media and the globalist, there's no going back.
[55:54.000 --> 55:59.000]  And you're not believing what they say or what I say. You're actually researching. You're involved. You're informed.
[56:00.000 --> 56:07.000]  I didn't plug this hour until now. If you want to finance what we're doing and be part of history and get great products at the same time, it's a total win, win, 360 win.
[56:07.000 --> 56:13.000]  A term I coined. And I mean, you couldn't buy war bonds better than info wars.
[56:14.000 --> 56:20.000]  And part of the enemy really persecuting the daylights out of me and my folks and everybody else is just made me get focused.
[56:21.000 --> 56:25.000]  And I, again, I understand I was weak. I had to be tortured, you know, to become strong.
[56:26.000 --> 56:29.000]  And so I just want to make sure that we go to the next level.
[56:30.000 --> 56:34.000]  And so I'm just telling everybody, you need to get the products. Everybody needs fish oil.
[56:34.000 --> 56:37.000]  We've got the cleanest, highest quality you're going to find out there.
[56:38.000 --> 56:45.000]  Big two months servings, the krill oil, the wild harvested fish oil out of the fjords in the Northern Atlantic.
[56:46.000 --> 56:50.000]  Very, very clean. Just, just, just, it's all there.
[56:51.000 --> 56:56.000]  And then honor roll is the full spectrum of fish oils and other key oils that are known to turbocharge the brain for your children.
[56:57.000 --> 57:01.000]  Just, I mean, fish oil is so unbelievable. It's just, the problem is a lot of it has mercury in it.
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.000]  These companies are so cheap, they don't de-nate that they don't pull it out.
[57:05.000 --> 57:08.000]  We get it wild harvested to get the very best.
[57:09.000 --> 57:15.000]  And then we, there's a whole expensive process to get the clean oil and it's at non detectable levels.
[57:16.000 --> 57:20.000]  Some spectrometers think they can find shadows of it. You know, California levels are impossible to follow.
[57:21.000 --> 57:25.000]  But this is where you want to get it. You don't want to get it from fish, especially big fish like tuna.
[57:26.000 --> 57:29.000]  The krill is really good because they're so tiny, they don't even bioaccumulate the mercury.
[57:29.000 --> 57:30.000]  So, they're excellent as well.
[57:31.000 --> 57:32.000]  InfoWarsLive.com, InfoWarsStore.com.
[57:33.000 --> 57:36.000]  And whether we're going to win or not is up to you because you are in this fight.

[59:15.000 --> 59:16.000]  You are the InfoWars.

[59:46.000 --> 01:00:01.000]  We are the Renaissance and we are winning.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:21.000]  And so does he. It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  Last year when that guy ran over a bunch of people in New York killing him screaming Allah Akbar and ISIS took responsibility.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:31.000]  They had congressional hearings saying it was fake news that InfoWars said that it was an Islamic attack.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:36.000]  ISIS took responsibility. They took attack for the latest Toronto trep attack, one of many.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000]  And the guy was screaming Allah Akbar and was an Islamist.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  And so here's Paul Joseph Watson's report on that.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000]  Another mass shooting by a racist, misogynistic, white male.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  When will the media and the government call this what it is? Terrorism.
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000]  The shooter's name was Faisal Hussain, a Muslim son of Pakistani immigrants.
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:01:00.000]  How dare you even suggest this has anything to do with the religion of peace? It's lamaphob.
[01:01:01.000 --> 01:01:02.000]  Then what caused it?
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  The mental illness, mental illness. He was depressed. He was sad.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:13.000]  The claim that the rampage was motivated by nothing more than mental illness was issued immediately after Hussain was named.
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:20.000]  A statement was written by Mohammed Hashim, a professional activist linked to the Muslim Brotherhood who has committed himself to quote,
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  framing a new narrative of Muslims in Canada.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  He was literally given an award for being a spin doctor and quote changing how Muslims are seen in the Canadian identity.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  The statement was clearly designed to distract from speculation that the shooting was an Islamic terror attack.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  How dare you question the family's statement? They're the victims.
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:43.000]  The media told me to embrace the shooter's parents.
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000]  No, the victims are the 10 year old girl and the 18 year old girl.
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  Their son murdered and the 14 wounded people who he traumatized for life.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  His parents aren't the victims. Go fuck yourselves.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000]  There's no evidence this was an Islamic terror attack. Racist.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.000]  Well, according to law enforcement, he visited websites affiliated with and expressed support for ISIS.
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  His other online activities suggested this could be a quote, G. Haddie inspired mission.
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]  He targeted an Orthodox Christian area of the city.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  He spared non-white people during the attack telling them,
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  Don't worry, I'm not going to shoot you.
[01:02:19.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  And ISIS claimed responsibility for the attack, something they don't normally do unless they're responsible for the attack.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  Don't talk to me about facts. We know facts are just a tool of white supremacy.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  And anyway, this isn't about Islam. This is about gun control.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:39.000]  The gun he used was already illegal in Canada. No law would have stopped this shooting.
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  Question for you. If this was a random act inspired by mental illness,
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  Why did the gunman look more proficient in his shooting skills than highly trained police veterans?
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  Conspiracy theorist.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:57.000]  Also, why hours after the ISIS claim of responsibility is CBC's top story about water on Mars?
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:03.000]  Why is Justin Trudeau being completely silent on this? Why has he taken off six days in a row?
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  Our prime minister isn't going to dignify your Islamophobia.
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:13.000]  Oh, really? That's funny because he was very quick to tweet about that Muslim girl who was attacked for wearing a hijab.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:17.000]  An incident which turns out was a complete hoax and never actually happened.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  Also, why is it terrorism when a white guy shoots up a school,
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  but just mental illness when a middle eastern guy shoots up a restaurant?
[01:03:27.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  Surely we should ignore the race of the perpetrator and look at the definition of terrorism,
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  a politically or religiously motivated attack to determine whether or not it's terrorism, right?
[01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  The real basis of this are Muslims in Canada who will be harassed and bullied by Islamophobes.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.000]  But wait, you said this had nothing to do with Islam.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  Man, Paul Watson has topped himself, so has Mark Dice.
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:02.000]  Well, let's go out to break with this little Brian Skelter piece that Brian's tried to block and ban.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  But getting serious, our main reason our YouTube channel is totally frozen for live streaming and faces complete deletion of billions of views
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  is because we show radical Islamists as saying they're going to kill people and they say that's Islamophobic.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:20.000]  See, I'm not allowed to tell you what's going on. I'm a bad person.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  I shouldn't tell you that ISIS took responsibility either. That's more fake news, even though it's admitted.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000]  We'll be right back. Here's Brian Skelter.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:33.000]  When historians look back on the Trump presidency, they'll say that this was the week that something changed,
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:39.000]  something really shifted in the conversations about the president, uncomfortable questions,
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:42.000]  moved him to the mainstream in a big way.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000]  Trump's odd behavior with Vladimir Putin is compelling so many people to ask,
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:49.000]  what does Putin have on Trump?
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000]  Has Trump been compromised?
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  All of those people, those experts, those reporters, they're looking at the fact that...
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  In Full Wars Life and infowarslife.com is extremely excited to announce our latest release,
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:07.000]  Winter Sun, a revolutionary type of vitamin D3.
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  Winter Sun is a premium quality vitamin D3 nutritional supplement.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:16.000]  It is produced by extracting oil from healthy nutrient dense plants known as lichens.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:20.000]  Every batch is analyzed for purity and D3 content.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:22.000]  It's completely free of toxins and allergens.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:26.000]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:30.000]  Winter Sun is the result of our pursuit of the best source of vitamin D3.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:33.000]  The research and development took over two years,
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:39.000]  but the result, as verified by independent laboratories, is the best vegan vitamin D3 product in the world.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000]  Read the facts at infowarslife.com about Winter Sun vitamin D3.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:50.000]  Not only does vitamin D3 promote a healthy mood, but vitamin D supports our memory and brain function.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000]  Something the globalists are targeting.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:57.000]  Visit infowars.com today or call 888-253-3139.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:02.000]  A lot of his supporters believe that we are the enemy of the American people,
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:05.000]  and that is really, really an awful situation.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000]  We are not the enemy of the American people. We love the American people.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  We are not the enemy of the American people. We love the American people. We love the American people.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:47.000]  They came in peace. We are not the enemy of the American people. We love the American people.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:05.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:14.000]  This is InfoWars. This is The Resistance. This is Victory.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:19.000]  Can't get no connection. Can't get through. Where are you?
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  I'm Alex Jones, your host. Thank you so much for joining us. Now into hour number two.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:31.000]  I want to open the phones up a little bit later in the hour to get your take on the state of the world right now
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:35.000]  and what you think the globalists are going to do to get themselves out of this route
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  or this galactic-sized pickle that they are deeply in.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:44.000]  But if you're a TV viewer and we're a radio show that's on the internet
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  and on television stations around the country,
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:52.000]  Document Cam shot please. Here's the president. And this was today.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  Twitter, quote, shadow banning prominent Republicans not good.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:03.000]  We will look into this discriminatory legal practice at once.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000]  Exclamation point, many complaints.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  I mean, I don't know how they were getting away with the last few years. 90 plus percent.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:17.000]  Well, it's like 80. Now it's 90 plus of all libertarian Christian conservatives.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  Mainline churches can't reach members on their Facebook.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  A mainline Christian groups, mainlines veteran groups.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  I got a whole stack of news where members of Congress have been shadow banned.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:33.000]  They can't post their political ads, but the Democrats are allowed to.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  And it's like, I'm a Tennessee grandma. Please reelect me.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:43.000]  I like pot. I love my grandchildren. I'm pro life. Oh, that's hateful. You can't have that.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  Meanwhile, they have, you know, Facebook pages with millions of followers saying kill the president, kidnap, baron, raping.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  We have all the internal videos. The good news is this is now coming out.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:04.000]  So we were, I retweeted it at real elevations. See the shadow banning report that woke up President Trump
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  that we put out a week and a half ago that got to the president and got to Congress.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  That's why I got so mad at Gates, who was chairing the committee,
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  because he knew all the info and said, you're a private company. Do whatever you want.
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:33.000]  And then they shadow banned him. But then there's the bravada, the, the Hootspa, the, uh, tuberous of these companies doing this.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000]  I mean, you think if you were going to ban all the conservatives and all the libertarians and all the Christians on Facebook, YouTube, Google, Twitter,
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  you think you'd leave at least the lawmakers that are elected? You know, you let them share their stuff.
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  Let's see. No, no, no. We must ban everything. And these Republicans didn't even know it.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  Then zero hedge started linking to these high tech sites. And I had my people look at it. It's accurate.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:01.000]  Kind of like they have the sites where you can trace your internet connection.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000]  They have stuff they can do. They have these sites out of Europe. They have some here now too.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  They're getting really big where you can look at your reach and how you're blocked.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  And people are going on there and they're like, I'm 97% blocked.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:17.000]  We know that because we have Google Analytics on YouTube.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  And we used to have, you know, some of the ads since from Google on, we still have a little bit of their ads running here and there, just so we have access to it.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  I won't give it in the inside baseball, but I mean, Hillary, we were like 50% shadow banned during the campaign, but they thought, oh, that's Alex Jones. No big deal.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:39.000]  Nobody listens to him. That matters that tens of millions of people a day. It's just no big deal. We're so arrogant. Hillary's so powerful. No one listens to him.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000]  He's just crediting to the Patriot message. Yes, yes, yes.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:49.000]  They want milk toast, you know, Harvard and Yale stuffed mummies that have betrayed the country up there. We're reading off teleprompters.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:56.000]  That's what the cool kids want. Not that Alex Jones. Who cares? We had 86 million viewers election week. Who cares?
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  We're the establishment. Let them eat cake. It's preposterous that they would listen to him.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:21.000]  But then two days after Rig Delexo, Google Analytics, everything, 90% cut and then Paul took the cake with 97% strangled.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  By the way, if you 97% cut the blood off of somebody's carotid arteries, you die.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  So it's like, oh, we haven't banned you. We've just 97% muffled what you're doing, your amplification.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  So they think with all these social justice warriors that they have created brigades out of these failed colleges with their enrollment down 30%, the NFL down 30, 40%, Hollywood down 30, 40%.
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  You're like, why is Zuckerberg down 20%? Why do you lose 16 billion? Because they're killing half their users being able to communicate with each other.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:09.000]  They thought under social engineering, if they wouldn't let you talk to your family or send people a meme, you'd go, well, I love sending memes so much.
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:15.000]  And I love communicating with people that came to my Facebook that I promoted, that I built, talking about you, talking about me.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:21.000]  That I'll just join the Democrats so I can still talk to people. That's not how people work.
[01:12:21.000 --> 01:12:29.000]  Little SJWs who get to college 18, scared, they bring them and they go, there's Nazis on campus. Yeah, you got to join us.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  Come to the Ford Foundation. And then that next night they go put a swastika on their door and then the little nerds get scared and they go, Nazis are going to get me.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:41.000]  And they go, yeah. Remember what happened to Candace Owens? She was a successful black lady launching IT stuff.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  So all of a sudden we're going to get you, you know, all this racist stuff. And then she found out it was the feminist Democrats doing it to get her under their control.
[01:12:51.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  So you get these scared people that have already been brainwashed in the public school. They show up at college, corporations do it now, Starbucks, it's all a big reeducation camp.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  And they just get them and they go, did you hear? Last night they burned crosses. Really? Oh God, there's probably half the white people at the school are Nazis.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:17.000]  We got to join the Communist Party right now to fight them. Okay, okay, gosh, I'll join them. And that's, we've infiltrated these college reforms done it.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:29.000]  You'll have, you know, at Berkeley, routinely, Bill Ayers shows up, you know, like, hey kids, and then he salutes Antifa and they march out and hit women in the head with bike locks.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  And it's like larping. It's like live action role-playing. And then, you know, white people aren't allowed at Missouri State, says the weird white lady.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:41.000]  Get me some muscle. Get me a big black guy over here, as if that doesn't sound racist.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:47.000]  She's like, she's calling dog. Get over here. Take this white out of here.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  They wonder why enrollment went down 25, 30% the next year. And it's still tanking. They don't care though, because they don't live in the real world, folks.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  So I knew that if we were to expose all this, that they never get away with it. And just for some reason, everybody was too lazy.
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:13.000]  Members of Congress were the other tech companies, but most of the other conservatives, they're like, well, Alex, we're not going to come on your show anymore.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  And we're not going to promote you anymore. Because when we do, we get shadow banned.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  And I said, but you know, once they cut me off, they're going to start doing it to you. You're just jealous that we're going to be bigger than you.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:29.000]  And I go, I don't want to be bigger. I wish you were better than me. I would literally quasi-retire right now if we could turn the corner.
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:36.000]  You think I like doing this? I mean, I don't like pushing my luck, walking point for 25 years.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:42.000]  No, I'm ready to get in the rear with the gear. I'm ready to go play some golf. I'm ready to go do some fishing.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  A lot of stuff I want to see. A lot of things I want to do. I don't want to risk my life every day, but you know what?
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:51.000]  I'm going to do it. I'm going to do it 100%. I'm going to like it, but it doesn't mean that I don't want to win the war.
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:57.000]  I'm not trying to be big than Shapiro. I'm not trying to be the big leader.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  I'm looking for leadership. I'm looking to win this war.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  And I told people, I told prominent people, I said, they're coming for you next.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:10.000]  And I said, watch, they're going to start banning you because they're jealous of you because you're so big.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  And I'm talking about other people, people can probably guess. And now those individuals, I've started to see they're getting censored.
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  Even though they went along and I'm not talking about Shapiro.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:24.000]  Even though Shapiro goes on and kisses the ring of Bill Maher.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:28.000]  I mean, those two almost simped each other's butts like two dogs.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:34.000]  It mattered. They're already getting him because they don't like you of your successful period.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  They want control. Ryan Stelter wants to be the only thing on TV and the weird hunchbacks that on Time Warner like putting a demon like that up.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.000]  It looks like the subway founder in front of you to rub it in your nose.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  Ugliness, hunchback, devil worship, weakness, failure.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:16:04.000]  I just want to go head up against these people and get this war wine.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:30.000]  It's a no brainer. A big Berkey water filter is the one you need, period.

[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:11.000]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is. The real drama can be found here in Lailania states. But a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[01:19:11.000 --> 01:19:30.000]  Volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels. To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity and pH. What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater.
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:46.000]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels. As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa pure raises the pH of the water.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:20:00.000]  So what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply. But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:16.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:58.000]  The Axis, a combine of communist China, the radical Islamist, the unelected Yunker Nazi dynasty of the EU, literally, can't make that up, haunched by another Nazi collaborator, George Soros, who's been worshipped by the ADL for rounding up and killing Jews, with Hollywood that hates America and the big banks, with a bunch of out of control authoritarian, weirdo professors that hate free speech.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:19.000]  Backed up by big pharma and the pharmacological complex engaging in a dumbing down eugenics operation run by people with hundreds of millions of dollars apiece who control trillions who are SJW social justice warriors to create race war and division to control us, divide and conquer.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:35.000]  That's it. I'm going to give the number out and take calls in the next segment, but I wanted to play a Mark Dice piece because, you know, Mark is a really funny guy and, you know, his average video had five million views until they shadow banned him.
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:44.000]  And now his average video has a half million views. But see, Mark Dice didn't stop being hardcore. In fact, Mark Dice got more hardcore.
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:54.000]  And then Mark Dice started doing things like I told him years ago, selling t-shirts, other products to fund himself, to launch other broadcasts, to do two more, and he started working even more.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:22:03.000]  So they forced Mark Dice from being with his media analyst degree and everything, god known for like 13 years. That's longer than that, I'm getting old.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:13.000]  To now full time doing this. See? And he's even more effective now. So that's all they make us do.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:28.000]  And I've got some big stunts plant. I mean, I'm all in, man. Metaphysically the last few days, we passed some demarcation line and we're winning.
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  And I've just accepted the fact that I am completely expendable and that I'm very comfortable with it.
[01:22:36.000 --> 01:22:43.000]  And I just want to win. I want humanity win. I want planetary victory. I love the species. I love you. And I'm just really at peace.
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:51.000]  And I know we're going to win. But some of us are going to have to take a licking for this victory.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:23:00.000]  And I can feel spiritually. And I mean this. I can feel your will and your strengths.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:11.000]  Amplifying God's will. And I can feel the fact that the intimidation and the bullying and the censorship and the attacks that you've gone through to tell the truth that you have fully
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:19.000]  like a buck and Bronco thrown the globalist off your back and you are free.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:27.000]  I just, I can feel it. I can feel the enemies on the move. I can see it. I know people in the office over the years.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000]  I've said, watch something big that's going to happen there tomorrow and it does. And the enemy's going to come back too.
[01:23:32.000 --> 01:23:38.000]  But I just, this is the strongest wave of God's energy, the Holy Spirit, whatever you want to call it.
[01:23:38.000 --> 01:23:44.000]  Because it's not even the Holy Spirit for babies where you just feel God's love. It's so intense.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:53.000]  It's will. It's determination. It's peace. It's justice. It's completion. It's victory. You're through it.
[01:23:54.000 --> 01:24:02.000]  It's not the first levels of Christ. It's deeper. It's bigger. It's the most high level. It's the synergy, the understanding, the stillness, the purity.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:10.000]  And then you just feel so sorry for the devil worshipers and people. They're doing more and more evil things, trying to get closer to the devil to get power.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:14.000]  When the devil doesn't have the power and never did.
[01:24:18.000 --> 01:24:23.000]  Let's go to the, that time of the markedized peace. We'll go over. We'll play it next segment.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:29.000]  And let me just do this right now because this is so insane. I haven't even counted all this.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:35.000]  And then the surrealness of what I saw in the news. And I'm not even going to give it attention or go to it.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:44.000]  Where YouTube use commit community guidelines saying violence, Islamophobia, which are just words they made up.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:56.000]  Now notice that's the, and child endangerment because I showed something that ABC news, CBS news, NBC news showed months ago of the 11, 12 year old.
[01:24:56.000 --> 01:25:02.000]  Well, the kid is like he's 12, partly breaking stuff in the parking lot and then hitting other people.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.000]  And he starts hitting some adult in the face three or four times and the guy pushes him down and then the kid gets back up.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:13.000]  McBreen did a joke PSA deal. I love McBreen's work. I think it was actually one of those better pieces.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:18.000]  So it only aired one time, but we got a strike for that for showing what ABC news show.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:24.000]  But, but see, that's what I'm telling you is it's just this thing where they say whatever it is.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  They take your video down. You don't even get to show people what it is. They just say child endangerment.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:40.000]  So then the Democrats who are constantly trying to take my kids jump on the bandwagon and run down to file a deal to restraining order.
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  Take my kids today at Travis County Court. I learned about this and people said, are you going to run down there? No, I'm not.
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:50.000]  Because I didn't endanger any kids. I didn't beat this kid up even though the news. Oh, I forgot that part.
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  I was going to start it there. Forbes is saying I beat up some kid in other state. It's not even me.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:04.000]  And at a metaphysical level, I'm not even going to defend that. Just whatever then put me in the lion's den.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  I mean, I don't even know anymore like the level of these people and the deception. I mean, look at this.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  Facebook admits it's blocked Republican candidates pro-second amendment ad.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:20.000]  Twitter lifts shadow ban on conservatives after congressman threatens FEC complaint.
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  Yeah, it's a federal election commission violation. It's illegal. As Trump said, they know this. They've been letting them do it. It's unbelievable.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  I mean, it's the biggest discrimination ever. YouTube issues, a new strike against Alex Jones channel over hate speech and child endangerment.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  So child endangerment for showing what ABC News showed. In fact, can we pull up? I've got the article somewhere in my stack from ABC News when they first had the guy pushing the kid down.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  I mean, I'm a news broadcast. I showed a viral video, but see when I do it, it's child endangerment and I've got, I've got Forbes here where I beat the kid up.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:27:00.000]  They say YouTube issues, new striking, Alex Jones channel over hate speech and child endangerment.
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:10.000]  Facebook asked to justify info wars and Fox News. Oh yeah, deadline.com. The Democrats are meeting at the big TCA presentation.
[01:27:10.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  One of the biggest organizations in the world for media and they're calling for Fox to be banned too. See, I told you it's everybody.
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  Facebook executives defend having Fox News and atrocious info wars on platform CEW. See, it's everybody.
[01:27:28.000 --> 01:27:34.000]  I told, it's like the Congress is like, you can ban Alex Jones. Congressman Gates says that's all right because he says nobody died at Parkland, even though it's not true.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:40.000]  Yeah, ban him, screw him. Meanwhile, they go, well, thank you, sir. We'll shadow that in you as well.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:44.000]  And you go, well, why would they do that? Because evil isn't smart.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  It's right when my report was sitting on all their desk.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  You guys just keep stepping in it, don't you?
[01:27:56.000 --> 01:28:00.000]  Facebook executives defend having Fox News on as Democrats call for it to be banned.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:06.000]  Trump accuses Twitter of silencing Republicans and calls it discriminatory and illegal. It is, and they are doing it.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  Infowars.com, CNN lies about banned info wars videos and new censorship attempt. See the videos. I should have said this at the start of the show.
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:16.000]  See the videos that they claim are all these things.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:24.000]  And then can we pull up the Forbes articles? I thought I had it here, but I'm having trouble finding the Forbes one where they say that I beat up the kid.
[01:28:24.000 --> 01:28:30.000]  Oh, here it is. Why YouTube's Infowars ban is meaningless. And they just go on and say ban everything.
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  He needs to be taken out of the air completely. Oh, here it is. This is ABC News, Yahoo News, a video of a man shoving a child that is dividing the Internet.
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  June 7th. And then if you pull it up, it's the video that Forbes says is me beating a kid up.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:56.000]  And this is in another state, and they name the man and everybody else, and it's not me. But who cares? Just say I did it. Fake news.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:02.000]  Tired of being censored by Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Patreon? Well, now you don't have to be.

[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:29.000]  She's all alone, all alone in a time of need, because he's racing and racing and putting the course. He's fighting and fighting and running on his horse. He's going the distance.
[01:33:29.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  Well, I just talked to my lawyers. Thanks to Forbes saying that I beat up an 11 or 12-year-old kid in another state. They are now at the Travis County Court. I was trying to take my kids right now as we speak.
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  Thanks a lot, Forbes. Really appreciate that. Unbelievable. They fake news media. But you know what? That's just the way it is. Fine. Make up whatever you can. Say the president hates Mexicans. Never said it.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:10.000]  Just tell your lies. Tell it and tell it and tell it. Oh, sorry. Here's Forbes and a bunch of others. Why YouTube's InfoWars ban is meaningless. Here is the retracted.
[01:34:10.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  Alex Jones played an ABC News video, they don't tell you that, of a young teen attacking adults and finally one of them pushes him to the ground.
[01:34:20.000 --> 01:34:31.000]  We said, look at this spoiled brat. Everybody else made that same point. But they said, Alex Jones attacked and punched the child. Punches a child to the ground. He actually pushed him to the ground, so they even lie on their retraction.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:48.000]  So here is where they said that I did it. And now the court case filed to take my children from it. I'm not laughing because this is fun. This is just next level.
[01:34:48.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  Why YouTube's InfoWars ban is meaningless. And it goes on to say, Jones pushes a child to the ground. This is it pushes on the other one too. So there you go. Jones pushes a child to the ground.
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:14.000]  And then they use this term. So that's how the fake news works. They said, Jones violated bullying of Muslims, bullying of transsexuals and child endangerment.
[01:35:14.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  Well, that sounds great. The videos were removed of Jones and child endangerment. You're like, what is he like? Giving his 10-year-old Jack Daniels or something or letting him play in traffic?
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  You don't know what it is. It's like, let this come up to you all the time. And they go, glad you lost your effing kids, scum.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:44.000]  And sometimes I'm sitting there with my children, like at the beach, and I'm like, this is my new wife. I got a baby with her. I got three children with my last wife. I've got my children.
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:55.000]  And then the two gay guys at the airport run up the wrecks and go, you want to go, you want to throw down. And then they look at my family because they told us, we're gay. You don't like us.
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:36:12.000]  I'm like, that's not true. And then they go, well, eff your family. And then Rex gets his bags before we do. He starts going towards where he knows we've got our car parked in the parking area across the street.
[01:36:12.000 --> 01:36:24.000]  And the dudes come over and blow up to him. 30-something-year-old snowboarder guys that were in a professional snowboarding deal. They weren't like little wimpy guys. And they were both about my size.
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  They were like, big guys like this to me. And I was like, they go to my son. It's like, because I'm this bad guy, because somebody told you so. I didn't attack this kid. This kid attacked somebody else, but it wasn't me.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:44.000]  And now my YouTube channel is frozen. And it's all over the news that I endanger children. So people take the news like it's God.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  CNN, Alex Jones, YouTube take it down for endangering children. Child endangerment. And they take it like it's God. And then they, like it's the 10 Commandments and they just run with it. He, he hurt his kids, he beat up a kid.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  There it is. YouTube comes down on Alex Jones for hate speech and child endangerment. But they don't show you a quote or a video. No, they just say it.
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  And then in every article, there's thousands. I looked at over a hundred last night this morning. It's the same thing over and over again. And then he said, none of the kids died at Parkland. And then he went and bullied him at their houses.
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:38.000]  And then he went to their graves and he, he harassed them. He, and then they never show a link, do they? Because they're liars, liars.
[01:37:38.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  And that's what's getting crazy is that they are trying to get whack jobs to attack the president, his family, me. And these people really believe I'm a Nazi. They really believe I hate gay people.
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:38:01.000]  Meanwhile, they want to bring in radical Muslims that are throwing gays off buildings. It's just none of it even matches reality. None of it ever matches what I ever said.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  Let's go to this Mark Dice piece. It's, it's really powerful. And we'll come back, I'll give the number, I'll take your calls.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  Special guest joining us. Here it is.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  Well, I guess CNN's brain filter doesn't like my impression of him. I tweeted him a little clip from Monday's video where I dubbed my voice over a clip of his actual show.
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:32.000]  And then I went back to check the replies and he blocked me. And just a few days earlier, he was complaining to Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey saying that he was contemplating quitting Twitter because people were tweeting mean things to him.
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  Dorsey had tweeted about a New York Times writer named Maggie Haberman who recently wrote a whole article about why she was walking away from Twitter. And so then Brad Stoutter responded saying, I'm really glad that you responded to her piece. But what about the sewer? I'm becoming reluctant to post because of how disgusting the replies are.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  Replies that show up right next to my content. In many cases, the attackers are not real people who your advertisers want to reach.
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  Dorsey responded, we've been getting better at both ranking and replies, slowing and stopping amplification of those intending to game our systems and removing malicious and suspicious accounts, bots included.
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  Thanks for your reply. I appreciate it. I don't envy your challenge, but I'm glad you're trying to clean up the joint. Quick plug for verified identity. I don't know how else to stop the sock puppets and troll farms.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:42.000]  I do think that there's a pretty high probability that in the near future that Twitter will probably go to a real name policy just like Facebook. And you'll have to literally upload your driver's license in order to get your account activated.
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  Oh, I should probably play the video that triggered Brian if you haven't seen it. And even if you've seen it, stick around because I want to cover some important Twitter censorship news in just a minute.
[01:39:52.000 --> 01:40:01.000]  When historians look back on the Trump presidency, they'll say that this was the week that something changed. Something really shifted in the conversations about the president.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  Uncomfortable questions moved into the mainstream in a big way. Trump's all behavior with Vladimir Putin is compelling. So many people ask, what does Putin have on Trump? Has Trump been compromised?
[01:40:16.000 --> 01:40:24.000]  All of those people, those experts, those reporters, they're looking at the fact pattern and they're seeing something strange, even something sinister.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  That sack of soy got so hurt over that video that I'd be willing to bet that he cried himself to sleep last night over it.
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  As much as I despise this little mouse, whose show is literally called Reliable Sources, I think that Alex Jones articulates the essence of who Brian Stelter is better than anyone.
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  This guy, the spirit, this smiling, leering devil that thinks you can't see what he is. He is your enemy, period. All the narcissistic devil worshipping filth.
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  I see you, enemy. I see you, enemy. Enemy. Enemy. You are my enemy. And I swear total resistance to you with everything I've got.
[01:41:13.000 --> 01:41:28.000]  Stelter, you will fall. You will not bring humanity down. God is going to destroy you. Get him off the screen.
[01:41:28.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  This is by far the greatest Alex Jones rant of all time, and that's just a small little sample of it. And speaking of Alex Jones, YouTube just issued another strike on his channel and censored four of his videos for violating the community standards.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  You can go and see the videos. They're backed up on another site. If you go to infowords.com. Oh, by the way, on Tuesday, Congressman Matt Gaetz was tweeting about how Twitter was shadow banning him and other Republican members of Congress by preventing their names or their accounts from even showing up in the search results.
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  If you didn't follow them and you happen to look up their accounts, and I had a whole list of people that I tested this with and myself was included on that shadow ban list. So I was going to do a whole video about this.
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  But thankfully, Congressman Matt Gaetz was tweeting about this. Donald Trump Jr. has been tweeting about this. It started making headlines and now Twitter just mysteriously fixed the problem.
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  I don't know when it started, but at least up until last night, if you searched on Twitter for a variety of key Republican names and conservative Twitter personalities, myself included, nothing would show up in the search results or for the recommended account.
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  All right, great job. Mark Gaetz.com. I'm going to make this point. See, until we fought back, they didn't quit, but they're going to come right back. They're going to run another raid guerrilla warfare as soon as we turn our backs. They have to be broken up. This is a sinister criminal conspiracy.
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:43:10.000]  The scientists at InfoWarsLife have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support and joint support. Discover the power of ancient medicine with bodies. Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.

[01:48:44.000 --> 01:48:52.000]  Dr. Martin Luther King has been shot to death in Memphis, Tennessee.
[01:48:52.000 --> 01:48:55.000]  KF King was shot from the back and the front.
[01:48:55.000 --> 01:49:00.000]  It was almost a victory where a planned infusion hit just pain-pain.
[01:49:00.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  They took the babies out of incubators and left the children to die on the phone.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:14.000]  I think this is a national security imperative. We have clear things that we do not understand how they work, operating in areas that we can't control.
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:15.000]  UFOs.
[01:49:15.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  Is this global governance at last? Is it one world with central bankers in charge?
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:25.000]  Israel claims the attack was accidental, but some former U.S. naval officers say it was on purpose.
[01:49:25.000 --> 01:49:29.000]  They describe the day's action as part of a continuing cover.
[01:49:29.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  Russian intelligence compiled a dossier on Mr. Trump during visits to Moscow.
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000]  Russian scum.
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  Denied everything. He called it all fake news.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:41.000]  And he accused CNN of being fake news.
[01:49:41.000 --> 01:49:43.000]  This is a national emergency.
[01:49:43.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  If they kill Trump or remove Trump, it will cause a massive civil war in this country.
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:51.000]  This is a female high-level emergency.
[01:49:51.000 --> 01:49:54.000]  We are at war with Russia.
[01:49:54.000 --> 01:50:00.000]  Are you aware that Mr. Stone also stated publicly that he was in direct communication with Julian Assange and WikiLeaks?
[01:50:00.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  The White House and the President are citing info wars.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:05.000]  They can shut us down, you're next.
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:10.000]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:14.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:50:14.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  So this broadcast is under unmitigated, unprecedented attack because we're accurate.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:25.000]  We cover real news, real information. We have a very special guest joining us the next hour.
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:31.000]  I will open the phones then. I got behind here, but there is a full-out attempt to ban free speech on the web.
[01:50:31.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  You know that. You've experienced it as activists, as patriots, for every race, color, and creed, the human race with red blood.
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:42.000]  But now, Trump's saying it's illegal. He's aware of it.
[01:50:42.000 --> 01:50:50.000]  They're having hearings in Congress about how conservatives are shadow-banned and they intensify the shadow ban on Republican candidates and members of Congress
[01:50:50.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  ahead of the midterms. This is unbelievable election interference.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  And I can't believe that they're arrogant enough to be doing this, but it's perfect.
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:07.000]  And that's why they're pissed, because let me tell you, a lot of people are lazy.
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:14.000]  They don't study historical doctrine. They don't know how things hook together.
[01:51:14.000 --> 01:51:19.000]  And so the establishment is really freaked out about info wars.
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:26.000]  Because you'll have analysts in the government that study their whole life, you know, one area that there is supposedly the person to talk to,
[01:51:26.000 --> 01:51:29.000]  and then you'll have other, you know, people that are on the ground.
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  Everything's compartmentalized. We're not compartmentalized. Info wars, not compartmentalized.
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:39.000]  I mean, the top of our heads, like a hydrogen bomb going off.
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:49.000]  This is the top of the heads gone. And they don't like that.
[01:51:49.000 --> 01:51:51.000]  Trying to get people stuffed for the memes.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:55.000]  Like, why did the catchment bed with a goblin? Goblin, goblin.
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:52:03.000]  And the media went, Jones believes goblins live under the winehouse, and he believes goblins are about to attack, and he believes Trump is fighting goblins.
[01:52:03.000 --> 01:52:14.000]  It's called satire allegory. Can we start the next segment with the famous placeboying catchment bed with a goblin, goblin, goblin, goblin.
[01:52:14.000 --> 01:52:18.000]  I don't believe goblins are real. And I wasn't serious about shooting Robert Mueller.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:22.000]  I said, I wasn't serious. I said, politically, it's high noon.
[01:52:22.000 --> 01:52:26.000]  Okay, it's having some fun.
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:32.000]  But I digress.
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:40.000]  They are in a conniption fit all over the news because John Podesta and Hillary still basically run the media in this country.
[01:52:40.000 --> 01:52:44.000]  That was their last master. Now the globalists have been politically decapitated.
[01:52:44.000 --> 01:52:48.000]  That doesn't mean literally, politically decapitated, their command and control system.
[01:52:48.000 --> 01:53:01.000]  They are just following the last orders from Podesta to shut down the Internet, use Alex Jones as the poster child, create sex war between men and women, divide and conquer, move forward with the big corporations,
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:04.000]  loading the country.
[01:53:04.000 --> 01:53:11.000]  Oh, I'm Bezos. I'm worth $160 billion. I pay no taxes, but a family making a hundred grand a year is racist and rich.
[01:53:11.000 --> 01:53:17.000]  We need to hire taxes. It's like the logic is under attack.
[01:53:17.000 --> 01:53:22.000]  A bunch of rich white dudes trying to create a race war.
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:27.000]  It's like, what the hell does that do?
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:35.000]  So here's the big news. Facebook is still plunging in the stocks 20% because their model is illegal spying.
[01:53:35.000 --> 01:53:41.000]  And then they won't even let conservatives who are most of the market.
[01:53:41.000 --> 01:53:47.000]  I mean, the average leftist can't even wipe their butt with both hands, man. I'm not gonna be mean. These are losers.
[01:53:47.000 --> 01:53:55.000]  And so they're going to kick out the productive society off your platform. Of course, you're going to sink into the abyss.
[01:53:55.000 --> 01:54:00.000]  It's hilarious, actually.
[01:54:00.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  And I don't want this to take the whole stock market. I just the NFL, Hollywood, they're all killing themselves because you've got crazy people like Sumner Redstone, who's 90 something years old, still in command of the biggest media company in the world, Viacom.
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:26.000]  And he's like, he's got some weird, you know, cuckold fetish thing like the Clippers owner.
[01:54:26.000 --> 01:54:38.000]  And so that's why everything you tune into is like weird, you know, sex stuff because he's obsessed with interracial porn.
[01:54:38.000 --> 01:54:47.000]  Because he's an old, weird racist. It's like the Clippers are. And you're like, you wonder why it's so crazy because it's being programmed by people with Alzheimer's.
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:50.000]  The whole New World Order is an insane asylum.
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:58.000]  I mean, Sumner Redstone was a smart evil guy 50 years ago. My God, he took over his dad's big, you know, chain of theaters and everything and said it isn't about the theaters.
[01:54:58.000 --> 01:55:03.000]  It's about the content. I mean, he was a visionary 70 years ago.
[01:55:03.000 --> 01:55:11.000]  Now he's just a crazy person with a brand of Swiss cheese.
[01:55:11.000 --> 01:55:16.000]  I just know some of the inside baseball about Redstone.
[01:55:16.000 --> 01:55:22.000]  Oh, I know some of those lawyers years ago. I learned a little bit.
[01:55:22.000 --> 01:55:27.000]  This old Jake Bloom still alive. One of the big lawyers in LA. How's he doing?
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:33.000]  Wonder how old those old boys are doing.
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  Anyways, getting back to what I was saying here, this is really screwed up and it's crazy.
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:54.000]  And so we've got a bunch of disease-brained 90-year-olds running the nuclear weapons, the government, everything.
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:57.000]  I don't actually think Google and Facebook and Twitter, these people run things.
[01:55:57.000 --> 01:56:08.000]  It's the crazy communist Chinese and a bunch of elderly oxigenarians who are mad because Christians were mean to them 75 years ago.
[01:56:08.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  So they're going to bring in all the Muslims.
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:20.000]  Cuckoo land, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo, cuckoo.
[01:56:20.000 --> 01:56:24.000]  All right, let me just do this at the end of the hour here and if I don't do this one here.
[01:56:24.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  I'm not fun about big mega banks of the communist Chinese. I'm fun about you.
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:34.000]  And we set out to produce the ultimate krill fish oil supplements.
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:42.000]  We have pure fish oil, wild harvested, the mercury removed, the non-detectable levels.
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:45.000]  You didn't get great stuff from fish, but the mercury's in there.
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  Krill's really great because it's had the mercury removed as well, but there's not really much to remove because krill's so small.
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:56.000]  It doesn't bioaccumulate, you know, little things, get eaten by bigger things and then it kind of builds up.
[01:56:56.000 --> 01:57:03.000]  Ultimate krill oil, ultimate fish oil, and then roll call is a whole spectrum of them just for brain.
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:09.000]  Krill oil and the fish oil has the whole spectrum for the heart and the body and the skin, not just the brain, but the honor rolls for the brain.
[01:57:09.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  That's for your kids and it's a child size, a little, little, little dobblet and your funding of the operation.
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:24.000]  What I want to say is absolutely essential to victory against those who stop planetary expansion to type 1 civilization and then the jump to the next level.
[01:57:24.000 --> 01:57:32.000]  Not interstellar travel, but interdimensional travel. In, through, and beyond.
[01:57:32.000 --> 01:57:39.000]  You fund us, we will deliver victory. You don't, we'll be destroyed, but others will stand up because you can't stop the signal.
[01:57:39.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  Humanity's going next level. We'll be back. Stay with us. Third hour, two minutes away.
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:55.000]  InfoWarsLife is launching its newest product. We're really, really proud of it. It's a best source prebiotic fiber.

[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:54.000]  Patrick in the great nation of Australia. You're on the air worldwide. Thanks for holding.
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:59:07.000]  Hey, I've been following you since I was 14 and I'm 32 now. I remember back when InfoWars and Prison Planet, it was just blue text on a white screen and it had to load down the page on my dial-up internet.
[01:59:07.000 --> 01:59:12.000]  And I thought it was pretty cool and read all the books and seen all the DVDs and followed all your guests.
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:16.000]  And I've been using your products since the first iteration of Survival Shield.
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:24.000]  And since then, I'm on the X2, the SuperMail Vitality, the Caveman, the Real Red Pill, MycoZX body, it's all amazing.
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:25.000]  Thank you, brother.
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:33.000]  Yeah, and I wanted to say that by following you so much, it's like you're just detoxing the mind, you're detoxing the body, you're detoxing the spirit.
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:38.000]  And it's just the more you know God, the more you fear God, but the more you chase God.
[01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:46.000]  And I wanted to say that it's an honor to stand side by side with you, the crew, and the listeners out there, 1776 worldwide.
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:44.000]  I'm not expecting to not get dirty swamp.
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:22.480]  Hey, can we play that thing I had you do about a week ago I never aired or men we did of
[02:01:22.480 --> 02:01:29.800]  Hillary saying I'm tired I can't get up and falling down all that them saying that's
[02:01:29.800 --> 02:01:34.560]  fake news we said that way let's queue that up out of our next guest but here's what's
[02:01:34.560 --> 02:01:38.640]  getting crazy the reason I remembered that a couple years ago right before the campaign
[02:01:38.640 --> 02:01:45.160]  was over and Trump elected I I did a little allegory of Bordor and I said this is an allegory
[02:01:45.160 --> 02:01:48.960]  of Trump going into Mordor to fight goblins and as long as he doesn't marry a goblin he
[02:01:48.960 --> 02:01:52.280]  has to go into the swamp he's gonna get some swamp stuff on him he's not gonna make every
[02:01:52.280 --> 02:01:55.800]  move perfect people are gonna lie to him he'll make deals with people that are goblins he'll
[02:01:55.800 --> 02:02:02.680]  find out later they're goblins just he can't knowingly get caught kissing goblins or in
[02:02:02.680 --> 02:02:07.240]  bed with a goblin I mean if Kim Jong-un isn't a goblin but he's trying to you know tame
[02:02:07.240 --> 02:02:11.280]  that goblin so you could kind of argue he has kind of gotten in bed with a goblin in bed
[02:02:11.280 --> 02:02:18.120]  with a goblin in bed with a goblin so they ran hard lines everywhere that Jones believes
[02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:25.680]  that goblins exist and Trump is in having sex with goblins that was all over the dish
[02:02:25.680 --> 02:02:30.200]  that's fake news ladies and gentlemen and it's the same thing when I go this is an allegory
[02:02:30.200 --> 02:02:35.280]  I mean it politically I don't mean it literally we play spaghetti western music Muller I'm
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:40.960]  gonna meet you on the field six shooter and I knew that they would take it and lie about
[02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:44.920]  it and then it would get all the stuff about him protecting Epstein and using it was an
[02:02:44.920 --> 02:02:48.560]  informant to set people up with underage kids I mean that's the big thing Muller did so
[02:02:48.560 --> 02:02:52.880]  I did all that knowing they'd misrepresent it and then knowing that actually pick up
[02:02:52.880 --> 02:02:57.240]  my part about him and being connected to the child molestation which is mainstream news
[02:02:57.240 --> 02:03:01.200]  but that would bring that back out but then I didn't realize that the mainstream media
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:06.640]  would deceive even worse and that they would actually just not even show the video mode
[02:03:06.640 --> 02:03:10.880]  but edited like like your quotes I'm not gonna even say it because they'll edit it play it
[02:03:10.880 --> 02:03:15.840]  but you know Alex Jones says Muller the last thing I want so see I'm not that smart I think
[02:03:15.840 --> 02:03:21.840]  I'm smart but they are going so low now with levels that I we've all got to be careful
[02:03:21.840 --> 02:03:27.680]  so in hindsight I wouldn't have said the Muller thing now because they went even lower than
[02:03:27.680 --> 02:03:31.680]  I thought and they dropped it because people saw through like Democrats are saying kill
[02:03:31.680 --> 02:03:35.760]  everybody everywhere right you know Trump's children murder them they're serious about
[02:03:35.760 --> 02:03:39.880]  it you know Scalises get an attack Rand Paul we're all getting attacked I'm saying nonviolent
[02:03:39.880 --> 02:03:44.520]  then I use this allegory to point out the hypocrisy they all flip out but still I don't want to
[02:03:44.520 --> 02:03:48.680]  get on their level that's what I'm saying let's go out to break with Hillary here is
[02:03:48.680 --> 02:03:54.280]  the she just claimed she just climbed Mount Everest last week here it is we cannot stop
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:04:00.880]  and we have to be supporting each other you know it's kind of exhausting to be part of
[02:04:00.880 --> 02:04:08.200]  protesting and marching and demonstrating and resisting but we cannot stop I've been
[02:04:08.200 --> 02:04:18.080]  back there listening to Randy and I'm so exhausted I can barely stand here I'm so exhausted I
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:30.240]  can barely stand here it's kind of exhausting to be part of protesting and marching and
[02:04:30.240 --> 02:04:39.520]  demonstrating and resisting that's their God that's their God because they're their God
[02:04:39.520 --> 02:04:45.760]  is weakness this is if you want to reflect their own ugliness we're right back stay with

[02:06:02.340 --> 02:06:27.960]  lines of the information war it's alex jones
[02:06:27.960 --> 02:06:47.940]  we are back live broadcasting worldwide vox day is our guest who's an author researcher
[02:06:47.940 --> 02:06:50.740]  i've been a big fan of his work for years i'm like why did i get him on as a guest when
[02:06:50.740 --> 02:06:54.580]  we finally had him on a few times vox day is the best selling author of sjw is always
[02:06:54.580 --> 02:07:00.300]  live and the studies actually show that they're like was it six times more likely to steal
[02:07:00.300 --> 02:07:07.020]  nine times more likely to a virtue signal they will not give the charity depending on
[02:07:07.020 --> 02:07:12.220]  the country so like 80% of charity is christians and conservatives and like i'm not bashing
[02:07:12.220 --> 02:07:15.940]  muslims but that's not happening with them and or anybody else it's christians and there's
[02:07:15.940 --> 02:07:19.580]  a reason the globalists don't like christians because whether you believe in god or not
[02:07:19.580 --> 02:07:24.780]  we just don't get in line with the big plan we don't worship the state so some of our
[02:07:24.780 --> 02:07:31.780]  founders probably a third of them are actually more kind of a luminous but not the illuminati
[02:07:31.780 --> 02:07:35.160]  vein but just trying to figure stuff out but they still recognize you don't want the king
[02:07:35.160 --> 02:07:41.380]  to be god you want god to be god because then that actually makes you god and not an illusifarian
[02:07:41.380 --> 02:07:46.580]  way but where the little g in the image of god where the state isn't on top of you you
[02:07:46.580 --> 02:07:50.300]  have a chance to try to build yourself up to a level at least where you can stare at
[02:07:50.300 --> 02:07:58.620]  the night sky and hopefully see god that's a silly allegory but voxday.blotspot.com voxversity.com
[02:07:58.620 --> 02:08:02.380]  and i guess he's still on youtube they're taking everybody down i don't vox was like
[02:08:02.380 --> 02:08:05.780]  we invited him on about a week ago and he was able to come on the day he's got his alt
[02:08:05.780 --> 02:08:11.740]  hero crackdown we're selling the new comic book first patriot conservative a really awesome
[02:08:11.740 --> 02:08:16.620]  comic book if i was in a comic book store i'd buy this at m4store.com alt hero number
[02:08:16.620 --> 02:08:21.180]  one crackdown but i said hey what's he want to come on about because i said i just wanted
[02:08:21.180 --> 02:08:25.580]  to get him on for commentary and dario the producer said whatever you want to cover well
[02:08:25.580 --> 02:08:31.460]  i don't want to make this gonzo journalism about me believe me i don't but i don't want
[02:08:31.460 --> 02:08:34.620]  to toot the listener's horn or everybody else's horn but i want to tell everybody something
[02:08:34.620 --> 02:08:40.100]  here this is a lot bigger than the super bowl okay because this is for your children's future
[02:08:40.100 --> 02:08:45.140]  we wrote a report to the president because i was told by people very close to the president
[02:08:45.140 --> 02:08:49.380]  well do you have a report because he we're aware a lot of this and i said you guys don't
[02:08:49.380 --> 02:08:53.820]  have a report doesn't Pompeo got somebody over and they don't know we know about shadow
[02:08:53.820 --> 02:08:57.180]  banning everything else but you know what what are you and it would they're not pat me
[02:08:57.180 --> 02:09:00.820]  on the head believe me and they're not just calling me up and you know to play patty cakes
[02:09:00.820 --> 02:09:07.500]  make me sound like a pat on the head deal so i said really you want the president wants
[02:09:07.500 --> 02:09:11.620]  a real report and i said well i got an engineer that knows as much as i do or more we'll put
[02:09:11.620 --> 02:09:16.740]  our heads together we'll put a report together three days later mike adams didn't sleep he
[02:09:16.740 --> 02:09:24.820]  wrote the definitive report paul watson did a seven page article that breaks it down and
[02:09:24.820 --> 02:09:31.740]  it has now gotten the president eight days ago it's gotten to congress and the weirdest
[02:09:31.740 --> 02:09:37.020]  little twist of strangeness they went to complete shadow ban of all republicans except john
[02:09:37.020 --> 02:09:42.620]  mccain the day after the hearing so five days after they get the report they have a hearing
[02:09:42.620 --> 02:09:47.380]  the next day they shadow banned everybody the censorship master plan decoded is on their
[02:09:47.380 --> 02:09:52.100]  desk we didn't just send it to everybody or ask you to email it we had it delivered i
[02:09:52.100 --> 02:09:56.660]  even got on the phone people that know gates he's been on the show it's private conversations
[02:09:56.660 --> 02:10:00.460]  i'm not getting into it people very close to him filled him in we we knew he was going
[02:10:00.460 --> 02:10:04.260]  to be chairing the committee screwed us over said you have a right to censor everything
[02:10:04.260 --> 02:10:07.820]  just don't call for killing republicans the next day they shadow banned him as a sign
[02:10:07.820 --> 02:10:14.180]  of weakness so i'm just telling you right now for listeners this is a big deal this
[02:10:14.180 --> 02:10:19.580]  is why they want to shut down because i'm not that special but i'll i'll i'll i'll spend
[02:10:19.580 --> 02:10:23.820]  ten hours you know in a week getting articles together and brainstorming with other people
[02:10:23.820 --> 02:10:28.020]  and writing a report to the president i mean i i respect that fact that i could get that
[02:10:28.020 --> 02:10:32.640]  to the president and and and notice all these big mighty trillion dollar empires google facebook
[02:10:32.640 --> 02:10:38.500]  twitter all of them are already shaking to their core right now because of their actions
[02:10:38.500 --> 02:10:45.500]  and their arrogance and their hubris and then that widows might of the little donation of
[02:10:45.500 --> 02:10:50.140]  energy and then the universe was waiting to give it back a trillion times that's what
[02:10:50.140 --> 02:10:54.060]  i'm telling people you have to send the radar ping out in free will tell like the secret
[02:10:54.060 --> 02:10:58.380]  no per whimper like you imagine castles in the fricking you know clouds and you get them
[02:10:58.380 --> 02:11:02.620]  you already we have on this planet the base to do everything we're already that's why the
[02:11:02.620 --> 02:11:06.660]  globalist want to control the future because we're there we are at the next level of the
[02:11:06.660 --> 02:11:12.140]  little g not god but in god's image and their panic so it's a huge time to be alive the
[02:11:12.140 --> 02:11:18.140]  reports are on info wars dot com emergency report the censorship master plan decoded
[02:11:18.140 --> 02:11:25.300]  the adams report and god the way they walked right into not the trap and we just did it
[02:11:25.300 --> 02:11:29.980]  i knew it was critical about hearing box the way they walked into that and now trump says
[02:11:29.980 --> 02:11:34.860]  it's illegal we're starting investigations the dominoes are falling notice the tech companies
[02:11:34.860 --> 02:11:42.140]  are plunging right now because the jigs up i mean this is this is just amazing how arrogant
[02:11:42.140 --> 02:11:48.260]  they are i'm ranting go ahead good to have you here with us thanks alex good to see you
[02:11:48.260 --> 02:11:51.180]  what do you think about that whole five minute ran i mean this epic moment we're at with
[02:11:51.180 --> 02:11:56.860]  the censorship the globalist the italy waking up the europe waking up just it's my website
[02:11:56.860 --> 02:12:01.380]  of the youtube about to be taken down because we dare show radical islamists doing bad things
[02:12:01.380 --> 02:12:09.820]  i mean this is one hell of a war yeah the the lid is coming off and the reason that
[02:12:09.820 --> 02:12:15.700]  they're cracking down so hard is because they can feel their control beginning to slip you
[02:12:15.700 --> 02:12:22.820]  know you had george soros openly admitting that he's failed he knows he's failed and
[02:12:22.820 --> 02:12:26.460]  what a lot of people don't realize that last week i have to be obnoxious and just add your
[02:12:26.460 --> 02:12:36.020]  correct go ahead so what's happening now is the fact that these tech companies the big
[02:12:36.020 --> 02:12:43.340]  the big social media companies are propped up you know they cannot exist in a normal economy
[02:12:43.340 --> 02:12:49.460]  so they're being propped up by lots and lots of of finance you know twitter has never made
[02:12:49.460 --> 02:12:56.900]  a dime ever you know these are not profitable companies that can actually make a long term
[02:12:56.900 --> 02:13:02.180]  go of it they're totally dependent on being propped up by government and by the banks
[02:13:02.180 --> 02:13:12.380]  they're propped up their propped up projections right and so what's happening here is that
[02:13:12.380 --> 02:13:18.500]  their ability to keep the stuff propped up is slipping because donald trump and and the
[02:13:18.500 --> 02:13:25.100]  people around them have been striking at their financial bases and so that means that their
[02:13:25.100 --> 02:13:31.660]  ability to fund their activity is is slipping and also they've grown to the point you know
[02:13:31.660 --> 02:13:36.780]  just like a cancer grows to the point that the body can't support it anymore they have
[02:13:36.780 --> 02:13:42.780]  grown to the point that the economy cannot support it anymore something like 85% of all
[02:13:42.780 --> 02:13:50.220]  online advertising goes to just two companies google and facebook but the advertising on
[02:13:50.220 --> 02:13:55.580]  google and facebook is no longer effective because that's the only place to advertise
[02:13:55.580 --> 02:14:01.780]  and so they've reached the point that their very success is now leading to their demise
[02:14:01.780 --> 02:14:07.060]  exactly because they killed competition they killed the very market by creating the tyranny
[02:14:07.060 --> 02:14:12.220]  it always happens so now the tyrants always try next level tyranny to make the tyranny
[02:14:12.220 --> 02:14:19.620]  work which always leads to revolution exactly and so we're at a point now where all of these
[02:14:19.620 --> 02:14:26.380]  converged industries are starting to get disrupted you know you saw what happened you're familiar
[02:14:26.380 --> 02:14:32.220]  with what happened in gamer gate now a new movement has started called comics gate and
[02:14:32.220 --> 02:14:37.620]  that's completely disrupting marvel and dc in the comics industry and that's really
[02:14:37.620 --> 02:14:42.940]  significant you know comics are not a big deal they are a big deal in our type as you
[02:14:42.940 --> 02:14:48.300]  know and that's the only help of hollywood is the comics all right the thing that's
[02:14:48.300 --> 02:14:55.860]  important about the comics is that comics are basically the seeds of the movies and the
[02:14:55.860 --> 02:15:01.660]  movies are what matter in term in cultural terms and so and the tv shows are what matter
[02:15:01.660 --> 02:15:06.700]  in cultural terms right now and so the comics are the seeds for that and that's why you
[02:15:06.700 --> 02:15:13.380]  are seeing them poisoning the seeds and pushing all that nonsense all the social justice nonsense
[02:15:13.380 --> 02:15:20.900]  all the diversity all the transgenderism all the flat out evil that they've been pushing
[02:15:20.900 --> 02:15:28.500]  now you're starting to see that converge into the movies let's explain how that happens
[02:15:28.500 --> 02:15:32.580]  exactly and it's a paradox you're right they're not important but they are important they're
[02:15:32.580 --> 02:15:36.660]  the seed of the art type if you look at a young type analogy but that's what they're
[02:15:36.660 --> 02:15:41.580]  going after and so if you look at netflix any of these shows it's pure weaponization and
[02:15:41.580 --> 02:15:48.540]  they put it in a total fantasy reality to make you turn off your cognitive analysis to put
[02:15:48.540 --> 02:15:52.660]  you in suspend disbelief then bombard you with political messages they'll be back with

[02:20:29.740 --> 02:20:34.620]  alex jones all right radio talk show host best selling author researcher down kind of
[02:20:34.620 --> 02:20:38.500]  the publisher vox days our guests and i was ranting earlier getting him on but i mean
[02:20:38.500 --> 02:20:41.260]  i can't help but bring us the middle of this they're having congressional hearings where
[02:20:41.260 --> 02:20:47.100]  they obsess on shutting us down shutting trump down i knew that was coming i get the report
[02:20:47.100 --> 02:20:51.740]  to trump he says they're illegal we're going to crack down we're going to expose it you
[02:20:51.740 --> 02:20:56.300]  can just energetically feel that the wind is turned we were kind of it that i think
[02:20:56.300 --> 02:21:00.140]  that back and forth point for a while but i i i don't want to get all you know hokey
[02:21:00.140 --> 02:21:04.620]  here because i don't claim i'm psychic but just at a gut level my guts have been wrong
[02:21:04.620 --> 02:21:09.900]  i think we've at least won a big battle and i think there's a big war war and you know
[02:21:09.900 --> 02:21:14.860]  you can win the battle lose the war but but vox day just just met it just as a christian
[02:21:14.860 --> 02:21:22.220]  as a patriot as a parent just as a person what would you call this time we're in and
[02:21:22.220 --> 02:21:29.020]  and just the the evil the the people that serve lies the the control freaks those that used
[02:21:29.020 --> 02:21:33.420]  understanding of human systems to control people versus empowering people what well where would
[02:21:33.420 --> 02:21:38.460]  you say they are right now because they've gone through different arrogance and then
[02:21:38.460 --> 02:21:44.140]  hatred everything now i i can feed and i don't take enjoyment in this but i can feel their
[02:21:44.140 --> 02:21:50.460]  true horror now because as you said their god is controlling our minds their god is killing
[02:21:50.460 --> 02:21:55.100]  free will in my view and well did you agree to disagree what would you nuance and add and
[02:21:55.900 --> 02:22:00.700]  what do you think's coming next because i never want to be too positive and then miss the
[02:22:00.700 --> 02:22:08.940]  counter strike what's coming next is they're going to increase the attacks on the financial
[02:22:08.940 --> 02:22:16.780]  bases of their opponents so we're already seeing that we've already seen stripe take down free starter
[02:22:18.460 --> 02:22:24.860]  and several other sites that were being used to fund different things like my own vox diversity
[02:22:24.860 --> 02:22:33.340]  was done on free starter we originally crowd sourced um alt hero on free starter so what
[02:22:33.340 --> 02:22:37.340]  they're trying to do is they're trying to cut down our options it's the same way that the same
[02:22:37.340 --> 02:22:44.860]  reason that they kicked info wars off youtube they want to try to eliminate your ability to reach out
[02:22:44.860 --> 02:22:51.580]  so just like hitler first put jews in and others he didn't like in in in in these ghettos to make
[02:22:51.580 --> 02:22:55.580]  you poor people forget about you then they ship you to the death camp it's the same thing they're
[02:22:55.580 --> 02:23:02.300]  they're isolating us they're cutting us off i don't think it's quite the same analogy because
[02:23:02.300 --> 02:23:08.780]  in the hitler analogy the jews were the minority in the current situation we are the majority
[02:23:08.780 --> 02:23:13.180]  exactly so what they're what they're attempting to do is what you have to understand is that
[02:23:13.180 --> 02:23:21.980]  they're very frightened okay they are terrified they're so frightened that google actually
[02:23:21.980 --> 02:23:28.220]  canceled a company-wide meeting because they knew that employees at google were going to send me
[02:23:28.220 --> 02:23:34.140]  the notes from that meeting now you're given inside baseball i read quotes from google saying
[02:23:34.140 --> 02:23:38.780]  they wouldn't even talk at the cnn tell them stuff they said because of security issues with jones
[02:23:38.780 --> 02:23:45.420]  i'm not going to hurt anybody they know we've got people inside yeah exactly and you do i do
[02:23:46.140 --> 02:23:52.860]  sort of itch does you know a lot a lot of people on the right do and it drives them crazy that they
[02:23:52.860 --> 02:24:01.580]  cannot spot police their own organizations but it's a catch 22 for them because they need they
[02:24:01.580 --> 02:24:07.820]  can't employ lots and lots of people without a few conservatives without a few christians and that's
[02:24:07.820 --> 02:24:12.780]  why they're trying to go to ai but before they get to the ai how do we exploit that there are free
[02:24:12.780 --> 02:24:17.340]  thinking people that don't want classic tyranny who actually hurt us and know that we don't hate them
[02:24:17.340 --> 02:24:22.940]  how do we get them to do even more to to to stop this well the most important thing that we need
[02:24:22.940 --> 02:24:33.740]  to do is we need to stop thinking that capitalism and free market principles preclude taking action
[02:24:33.740 --> 02:24:41.260]  against these enemies of the state i mean they are literally enemies of the state you're so smart
[02:24:41.260 --> 02:24:45.020]  you're right i watch those republican congressmen go well it's free market you're allowed to ban
[02:24:45.020 --> 02:24:49.580]  whoever you want no you're free market you can't say a black person can't ride the train
[02:24:49.580 --> 02:24:54.860]  or a conservative and but they use that like it's free market we're being free market no they're not
[02:24:55.980 --> 02:25:02.300]  right exactly it's it's kind of akin to when the national football league first allowed passing
[02:25:02.940 --> 02:25:09.500]  you know it used to be that the forward pass was illegal and then they legalized it and imagine
[02:25:09.500 --> 02:25:14.860]  how bad a football team would lose if they refused to throw the ball because they said well you know
[02:25:14.860 --> 02:25:21.340]  passing is not part of the game well what the republicans need to understand and and what even
[02:25:21.340 --> 02:25:28.860]  donald trump himself i don't think fully understands is that you have to play by the new rules they
[02:25:28.860 --> 02:25:35.500]  set the rules those are the rules of the game now you have to play by them or you're going to lose
[02:25:35.500 --> 02:25:42.460]  of course they're terrified of that which is why you see uh people like ben Shapiro and david trump
[02:25:42.460 --> 02:25:49.660]  or david french and all the cucks complaining about how james gunn the marvel director got held
[02:25:49.660 --> 02:25:55.740]  accountable for all his you know wasn't that a big tell that you've got the the fake conservatives
[02:25:55.740 --> 02:26:02.140]  defending a guy that worships pedophilia exactly and and but this is but isn't that the litmus test
[02:26:02.140 --> 02:26:08.860]  that's the litmus test if you support pedophilia or abortion you are the enemy uh i certainly works
[02:26:08.860 --> 02:26:16.300]  for me keep going i'm sorry but no it's fine the the thing that's important to understand is that
[02:26:16.300 --> 02:26:22.460]  this is the same thing what you're seeing with the fake conservative commentators
[02:26:23.260 --> 02:26:29.180]  uh in the gun situation and what you're seeing with the republican congressman dealing with
[02:26:29.180 --> 02:26:33.980]  the big social media companies it's exactly the same thing they're trying to give them a pass
[02:26:33.980 --> 02:26:41.420]  they're trying to say well uh we don't play the game that way it's it's not it's not right we shouldn't
[02:26:41.420 --> 02:26:46.140]  we shouldn't play the game according to the rules we should play the game according to the rules
[02:26:46.140 --> 02:26:50.540]  50 years ago but that doesn't work and so let me ask you this question we'll come back and mourn
[02:26:50.540 --> 02:26:56.220]  to this because you're on target box days here why did we brief congressman gauge we knew was
[02:26:56.220 --> 02:27:01.980]  going to be chairing most the committee meeting the first you know hour was good light we he got
[02:27:01.980 --> 02:27:06.940]  the briefing he knew and he decided to go throw me under the bus lie agree to all their stuff
[02:27:06.940 --> 02:27:12.700]  and then the next day they shadow banned a bunch of republicans like like he thought he would kiss
[02:27:12.700 --> 02:27:16.860]  their butt and then they would like promote him he didn't know they took that as weakness
[02:27:16.860 --> 02:27:20.780]  and he's seen as an enemy i don't understand his i know his daddy gave him everything and i don't
[02:27:20.780 --> 02:27:25.580]  want to go on some hate congressman gates thing but i know he specifically got briefed on this
[02:27:25.580 --> 02:27:31.260]  box we worked hard to get this report to him and the president trump responded but i don't know
[02:27:31.260 --> 02:27:35.980]  i guess gates thought he was betting on the winning horse here well i think there's two
[02:27:35.980 --> 02:27:43.100]  reasons number one uh there's a a lot of people on the right who really derive satisfaction by
[02:27:43.900 --> 02:27:49.340]  being more than fair to the enemy you know they think that that somehow makes was going to win
[02:27:49.340 --> 02:27:56.140]  them respect or something what they don't realize ingratiation exactly and it's it's not going to
[02:27:56.140 --> 02:28:02.140]  work it never works as you said it is showing weakness and whenever you show weakness to the
[02:28:02.140 --> 02:28:07.260]  left they come after you and they come after you at exactly the point of weakness that you've
[02:28:07.260 --> 02:28:13.980]  demonstrated and that's why it's so important for you to remain pugnacious and not back down when
[02:28:13.980 --> 02:28:18.940]  whenever they try to try to throw so uh whenever they try to threaten you that's why it's so important
[02:28:19.660 --> 02:28:25.660]  not to apologize to sjw's whenever they're demanding an apology not to resign not to quit
[02:28:25.660 --> 02:28:32.540]  because everything that they're doing is an attempt to demoralize discredit and disqualify
[02:28:33.580 --> 02:28:38.860]  i'm not just saying this you are so it's true because i go on my own code and and then i operate
[02:28:38.860 --> 02:28:42.380]  by that and then i would like admit when i made mistakes or stuff and then they would attack
[02:28:42.380 --> 02:28:47.340]  that point and then build a whole system like they're like blind they only know how to attack
[02:28:47.340 --> 02:28:51.580]  with those of us to have a compass they think when we admit we did something wrong that oh that's

[02:33:30.940 --> 02:33:36.620]  and vox day is getting into the mindset of the globals controllers and their minions is there
[02:33:36.620 --> 02:33:40.780]  any way to free their minions because it's easier just to be their enemy and be mad at them but how
[02:33:40.780 --> 02:33:46.460]  do we ever get them out the problem is once they give over to that system they just progressively
[02:33:46.460 --> 02:33:53.260]  are given over to delusion like the bible says and they're totally turned over to it so how do we
[02:33:53.260 --> 02:33:58.540]  defeat that well we do with i think having fun reaching out to them showing how they've been
[02:33:58.540 --> 02:34:03.420]  conned but also being strong and not buying into their system because they're weak they're looking
[02:34:03.420 --> 02:34:09.500]  for power so when you sit there and act like you're appeasing them it only encourages them to do it
[02:34:09.500 --> 02:34:22.060]  more and more and more here's a little peace the year is 1995 and info wars launches the last of

[02:35:14.860 --> 02:35:20.780]  about things like that and but if you think about a berry goldwater or ronald reagan before he got
[02:35:20.780 --> 02:35:25.260]  elected president and all the people talking about the new world order and globalism and
[02:35:25.260 --> 02:35:32.140]  donald trump's lawyer uh cone it was the head of the unamerican activities committee those guys
[02:35:32.140 --> 02:35:37.500]  were all actually right and they weren't perfect but they liked free market they liked america they
[02:35:37.500 --> 02:35:42.140]  liked they weren't mad at some other guys smarter than them or better looking that was successful
[02:35:42.140 --> 02:35:45.900]  they saw that as a better world for their kids oh great wow i admire that guy or that woman
[02:35:46.700 --> 02:35:50.860]  but not these little chicken crap people i call the chicken you know what dimension
[02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:58.220]  little term invented and they are mad at success here's the vox i don't just say you're a smart
[02:35:58.220 --> 02:36:02.780]  guy when it comes to their their mindset and what you say is real veritas and we're gonna get your
[02:36:02.780 --> 02:36:06.540]  comics too and all the rest of it and this fun piece your guys put together that we've tweeted
[02:36:06.540 --> 02:36:14.540]  out at real life shows but how do you quantify the controllers and what guides them versus their
[02:36:14.540 --> 02:36:20.220]  minions on average and do we waste our time trying to reach out to the minions does that only
[02:36:20.220 --> 02:36:24.460]  encourage them that oh look you want me because i'm powerful when they're not do we just build a
[02:36:24.460 --> 02:36:28.540]  better world and know that they'll then see by example because i mean there's no way to perfectly
[02:36:29.180 --> 02:36:35.340]  quantify what i'm saying i'm just it's so obvious once you know history and common sense that people
[02:36:35.340 --> 02:36:40.460]  should just join the liberty movement but but then these other people are sworn to destroy us
[02:36:40.460 --> 02:36:46.300]  and it's just so stupid like i don't even want to have a war with these people you have to show them
[02:36:46.300 --> 02:36:56.460]  the face of evil you have to show them that the evil is real that it is material that it is not
[02:36:56.460 --> 02:37:06.860]  metaphorical and that it can be resisted at the end of the day people are afraid and what they
[02:37:06.860 --> 02:37:12.940]  respond to is seeing people who are not afraid people who are willing to stand up and say two
[02:37:12.940 --> 02:37:20.540]  plus two does not equal thirty seven there are only two sexes you know the more that you stand up
[02:37:21.260 --> 02:37:26.460]  and speak the truth the more that others are inspired to do the same
[02:37:30.300 --> 02:37:35.180]  that was very profound just just that 30 seconds i wish i could crystallize it now but that's true
[02:37:35.820 --> 02:37:39.340]  they want to control reality they want to make you accept things that aren't true they want to
[02:37:39.340 --> 02:37:45.260]  bully you into submission and the reason they fear and since are you and info wars and matt rudge and
[02:37:45.260 --> 02:37:52.380]  all of us is we fear god way more than we fear them and they can't stand the fact that we're not scared
[02:37:54.220 --> 02:38:00.300]  that's exactly true you know when i got involved with the uh campaign against the
[02:38:00.300 --> 02:38:09.100]  hugo awards called rabid puppies i was initially by myself and you know i'd been kicked out of the
[02:38:09.100 --> 02:38:14.540]  science fiction writers association uh and they were trying to claim that you know i was just a
[02:38:15.660 --> 02:38:24.380]  extremist freak all on my own etc etc but you know i reached out to john c right and i asked him if
[02:38:24.380 --> 02:38:31.900]  if he if these had any work that we could publish and he said uh you know i don't know who you are
[02:38:31.900 --> 02:38:37.820]  i'm not really that interested and i explained it a little bit more and he said oh oh you're the guy
[02:38:37.820 --> 02:38:42.940]  who stood up against those you know lunatics uh pushing social justice and science fiction
[02:38:44.060 --> 02:38:51.900]  absolutely i will work with you and so you know just that one act of one guy standing up with me
[02:38:51.900 --> 02:39:00.700]  me led to another and another you know to the point that you know a lot of people have a tendency
[02:39:00.700 --> 02:39:07.820]  to overestimate the size of our operation and the extent of our influence but that's a key
[02:39:07.820 --> 02:39:12.700]  example like the bible says what to you agree on on earth is done in heaven it's that will
[02:39:13.260 --> 02:39:18.540]  and and and the fact that like you said we are the majority that want freedom and prosperity
[02:39:18.540 --> 02:39:23.740]  and decency and transparency and not and and all this stuff because not that we couldn't be evil
[02:39:23.740 --> 02:39:27.260]  and do a bunch of bad stuff we don't want to be like that we don't want to have a world like that
[02:39:27.260 --> 02:39:31.580]  we're honorable we have chivalry and the fact that once you stood up and did something right
[02:39:31.580 --> 02:39:37.260]  you had no idea that how popular you already were with the real thought leaders but there were people
[02:39:37.260 --> 02:39:41.660]  that ran associations that were gatekeepers claiming that they were the thought leaders
[02:39:41.660 --> 02:39:48.220]  when all they were was people trying to steal the energy that's exactly what happens in the
[02:39:48.220 --> 02:39:55.660]  media it's what happens in publishing it's what happens in movies they're constantly inflating
[02:39:55.660 --> 02:40:02.460]  and exaggerating their own influence and their own numbers you know you've probably read a little
[02:40:02.460 --> 02:40:08.940]  bit of sjw's always lie uh the the guy who was i didn't just read it i gave it to my older daughter
[02:40:08.940 --> 02:40:15.020]  and son but yeah go ahead um you know there's a very important part there where the guy who
[02:40:15.020 --> 02:40:21.180]  was claiming to be the the biggest blog in science fiction and and he was believed to
[02:40:21.180 --> 02:40:25.580]  be the biggest blog in science fiction i believed it you know he was he was the president of the
[02:40:25.580 --> 02:40:31.260]  association uh everybody talked about his blog his his books were you know he'd been signed to
[02:40:31.260 --> 02:40:38.220]  a contract by the the number one publisher but the funny thing was uh he he forgot to lock down
[02:40:38.220 --> 02:40:47.980]  one of his uh traffic measures and so i ended up discovering through one of my guys that his
[02:40:47.980 --> 02:40:55.260]  actual traffic was actually one fiftieth of what he was broadcasting and what he was claiming and
[02:40:55.260 --> 02:41:01.820]  what the new york times was reporting and so this is very very typical you know he has no
[02:41:01.820 --> 02:41:07.020]  clothes it's like the three days after hillary lost tens of thousands of libertarian conservative
[02:41:07.020 --> 02:41:11.180]  sites i'm glad they did the work to categorize this did an eighty percent drop in traffic
[02:41:11.180 --> 02:41:15.020]  everybody said how are you doing your traffic's all gone i said actually our traffic's up
[02:41:15.020 --> 02:41:20.700]  they just in a mythical thing said i was losing and everybody it wasn't even true but corporations
[02:41:20.700 --> 02:41:28.860]  and people dropped advertising and stuff because of the fake metric yeah they lie constantly and
[02:41:28.860 --> 02:41:33.500]  but the what's important to understand is the nature of their lives the nature of their lives
[02:41:33.500 --> 02:41:43.260]  is always to exaggerate their own influence to denigrate your influence to lie and exaggerate
[02:41:43.260 --> 02:41:50.060]  about their numbers and to try to claim that yours are are much less than they are and then
[02:41:50.060 --> 02:41:56.620]  overall the most important thing that they try to do is to demoralize the right because they
[02:41:56.620 --> 02:42:01.740]  know the right outnumbers them and they're terrified by of that and so they're trying to
[02:42:01.740 --> 02:42:06.700]  demoralize us so that we will not resist come back let's talk about then how you think they're gonna
[02:42:06.700 --> 02:42:12.060]  counter strike vox days with us i didn't realize this to like five i'll be sitting with my family
[02:42:12.700 --> 02:42:16.780]  and my great-looking family and i'm saying you know it's not a bad thing i'm i'm proud of this good

[02:42:27.580 --> 02:42:35.580]  family they just it's like you can't help a vox they are so pissed that i could kick five a hundred
[02:42:35.580 --> 02:42:40.220]  of their asses let's not brag maybe a hundred and i might i don't think i'm that tough but if they're

[02:47:18.860 --> 02:47:24.620]  eradicate it's time for you to choose a side you're listening to alex jones
[02:47:25.740 --> 02:47:29.820]  you know i forget which bible verse it is you were neither hot nor cold i spit you out of my mouth
[02:47:29.820 --> 02:47:34.540]  well we'll try to pull that up if somebody can do that but that's the thing you're either evil
[02:47:34.540 --> 02:47:38.860]  or you're good you're either trying to be good or you're trying to be people that love evil are
[02:47:38.860 --> 02:47:42.940]  trying to swim towards that black hole people trying to love god trying to try to like be the
[02:47:42.940 --> 02:47:51.260]  best they can and if you pull back from this and you look at it and you study what the globalists
[02:47:51.260 --> 02:47:55.580]  are doing they're trying to hurt people they're trying to dumb people down that they're trying
[02:47:55.580 --> 02:48:01.900]  to control free will they're trying to do everything that god's trying to fight and
[02:48:01.900 --> 02:48:07.500]  they always in sitcoms and shows i don't even watch much tv but man almost anything i turn on
[02:48:08.060 --> 02:48:14.860]  it's revelation 316 so then because thou art luke warm and either cold or hot i will spit
[02:48:14.860 --> 02:48:24.780]  the out of my mouth kim james version you pull back from this and there's no sane reason to
[02:48:24.780 --> 02:48:33.100]  support communism or globalism or any of this but they do it and and i think the i think the greatest
[02:48:33.900 --> 02:48:39.020]  i'm not a calvinist but i think there's a truth to you have free will but also predestined but if
[02:48:39.020 --> 02:48:44.860]  you're predestined you have to have the free will to make the decision i think that's why so many
[02:48:44.860 --> 02:48:49.740]  calvinist i know people i've known that like invented computers made billions and gave it all
[02:48:49.740 --> 02:48:55.020]  the salvation army and stuff is that people that are predestined are so guilty they tend to get
[02:48:55.020 --> 02:49:00.380]  roped in by liberals and some guilt thing to then serve them and their larger agenda and i don't
[02:49:00.380 --> 02:49:05.500]  know how if i had to describe this like some of god's greatest people pull the horses
[02:49:08.060 --> 02:49:14.220]  and pull the carriage of the devil i don't know how to describe that but it's like a it's like
[02:49:14.220 --> 02:49:20.140]  it's like a psychic delusion where some of the best people are the ones empowering this whole thing
[02:49:20.140 --> 02:49:24.620]  and they they they they're upset they're conflicted they know they're not doing right they know they're
[02:49:24.620 --> 02:49:29.980]  not making god happy but somehow there's like a disconnect where what they're doing is being
[02:49:29.980 --> 02:49:35.180]  shunted around i think at a gut level because they're in the break i was literally praying to god
[02:49:35.180 --> 02:49:41.420]  to understand how to defeat this and it's that is getting people that love god to stop listening
[02:49:41.420 --> 02:49:46.940]  to the accuser who knows they have a conscience so tells them how bad they are so that they then
[02:49:46.940 --> 02:49:52.460]  serve that agenda and i think that's the essence of the sjw a vox day of all your great work vox
[02:49:52.460 --> 02:49:57.660]  university on youtube vox university dot com vox first city vox day dot blog spot dot com
[02:49:57.660 --> 02:50:01.420]  the really critical stuff i mean i'm kind of just all over the map here just trying to like
[02:50:01.420 --> 02:50:07.580]  get into the esoterics or the hidden agenda of who these people are because you go to a democrat
[02:50:07.580 --> 02:50:14.060]  event i mean i don't go to these events that feel powerful you'll see the weird democrats
[02:50:14.060 --> 02:50:21.500]  ruling over these people when you're there and it feels pathetic but these are like soul sucked
[02:50:22.540 --> 02:50:27.500]  people like like i know white people i know black people i know hispanics where one guy one
[02:50:27.500 --> 02:50:32.780]  brother's a christian and he's super successful and good-looking and strong and smart and the other
[02:50:32.780 --> 02:50:37.820]  brother looks just like him but he's a leftist and he can hardly get out of his car it's like
[02:50:37.820 --> 02:50:43.740]  something is sucking their soul vox we didn't prescript this interview i'm i'm i'm i'm asking
[02:50:43.740 --> 02:50:49.020]  you as your smart philosopher and a christian what do you think this is i mean how is it so
[02:50:49.020 --> 02:50:54.780]  obvious these people look like the living dead is what i'm saying it's the results of corruption
[02:50:54.780 --> 02:51:02.860]  you know when your spirit is corrupted your mind is corrupted and it will eventually affect your
[02:51:02.860 --> 02:51:09.100]  body i mean we all understand this on a very simple level you know if you feel down you don't go to
[02:51:09.100 --> 02:51:15.580]  the gym you eat like crap it makes you feel worse and it puts you all into a spiral well the same
[02:51:15.580 --> 02:51:23.740]  is true on the spiritual level you know when when you sin and you give into your sin and you can't
[02:51:23.740 --> 02:51:28.300]  pull yourself out of it you start to dislike yourself you start to despise yourself you know
[02:51:28.300 --> 02:51:33.180]  and and that's why one of the most important aspects of christianity and one that christians
[02:51:33.180 --> 02:51:42.620]  often forget is that jesus provides hope and forgiveness and forgiveness so it's so important
[02:51:42.620 --> 02:51:52.700]  to understand that um you have to allow yourself to hope you know there's times when when i get
[02:51:52.700 --> 02:51:59.500]  frustrated there's times when i get down but one thing that always helps me get back on my feet again
[02:52:00.220 --> 02:52:07.420]  is being reminded of the fact that we are not given a spirit of fear you know we don't another
[02:52:07.420 --> 02:52:14.780]  saying that the guys on my blog like to use is all we need is 12 you know jesus christ didn't need
[02:52:14.780 --> 02:52:21.180]  a legion of soldiers he didn't need an army he just needed 12 guys and that was enough to shake the
[02:52:21.180 --> 02:52:28.060]  world so the fact that we don't have billions in our bank account the fact that we don't have
[02:52:28.060 --> 02:52:33.980]  organizations with tens of thousands of people working for us doesn't matter all we need is 12
[02:52:33.980 --> 02:52:39.020]  and that's all illustrated i keep because the average leftist goes oh look you're under attack
[02:52:39.020 --> 02:52:44.140]  alex oh look all this is happening and i'll look at trump no that's because we're doing what we're
[02:52:44.140 --> 02:52:49.740]  supposed to that's a sign of the success don't people get that that it's not like i'm losing
[02:52:49.740 --> 02:52:54.300]  because they're after me people like how are you taking it right now i'm like man i'm taking this
[02:52:54.300 --> 02:52:58.540]  really well i mean it's not fun physically in the flesh but my spirit says i'm in the right
[02:52:58.540 --> 02:53:02.380]  direction they don't even like would people don't get that like this freedom is it free
[02:53:04.380 --> 02:53:09.100]  no i know exactly what you mean that there's this moment where you feel the gut punch
[02:53:09.660 --> 02:53:15.420]  you know there's this moment where you think oh no you know this is this is terrible and then all
[02:53:15.420 --> 02:53:21.500]  of a sudden the adrenaline kicks in and then you start thinking about why they did that and you
[02:53:21.500 --> 02:53:29.580]  realize they didn't do that out of strength they didn't do that out of confidence they did that
[02:53:29.580 --> 02:53:35.900]  because i scare the crap out of them let's go further there are children because this religion
[02:53:35.900 --> 02:53:40.540]  is about torturing children and sucking their life absence begging for god on their knees right
[02:53:40.540 --> 02:53:46.140]  now being tortured and raped and we're not it's we're the answer and we're supposed to die for
[02:53:46.140 --> 02:53:50.700]  them if we have to so then stop being whips folks if you saw the kid being raped wouldn't you fight
[02:53:50.700 --> 02:53:55.900]  for their freedom well it's happening this whole system is that so their prayers went up to god
[02:53:55.900 --> 02:54:00.620]  god reached down to the few people that are willing to fight and so stop worrying about what they do
[02:54:00.620 --> 02:54:06.300]  to you worry if you don't take this commission because god isn't congress giving some officer
[02:54:06.300 --> 02:54:10.940]  commission this is god giving you a commission and i think people should take that commission
[02:54:12.620 --> 02:54:18.460]  a book that i would really encourage your viewers to to read or to listen to the audiobook
[02:54:19.500 --> 02:54:25.020]  there's a video about it on voxsiversity.com it's called the it's a book called the last closet
[02:54:25.820 --> 02:54:32.540]  and it's a book that was written by a woman who is the daughter of two very famous pagans
[02:54:32.540 --> 02:54:37.580]  Walter Breen and Marion Zimmer Bradley. Marion Zimmer Bradley is probably the most influential
[02:54:37.580 --> 02:54:45.260]  feminist science fiction writer that that has ever lived and they were horrific child abusers
[02:54:45.260 --> 02:54:50.060]  and they taught her that god did not exist they taught her to sneer at christianity and all that
[02:54:50.060 --> 02:54:54.700]  sort of thing but the amazing thing about the story and despite the fact that it on the one hand
[02:54:54.700 --> 02:55:04.220]  it's a psychosexual horror show but it is also a triumph because it she talks about how she gets
[02:55:04.220 --> 02:55:11.100]  afraid even in the midst of that she sensed that god was real that god loved her and that god was
[02:55:11.100 --> 02:55:16.940]  going to get her out of it and he did and you know and now she's a wonderful christian woman
[02:55:16.940 --> 02:55:23.900]  she's married she's got children she makes beautiful music and you know look at the book
[02:55:23.900 --> 02:55:30.860]  the last closet and you will understand what is at stake here in every single one of those children
[02:55:30.860 --> 02:55:34.860]  i agree with you so explaining that because i feel for the children's horror i could feel it right
[02:55:34.860 --> 02:55:40.220]  now they're called to god what is this how could you have a religion based on torturing children
[02:55:40.220 --> 02:55:46.940]  i i just i'm just mad at myself i don't have the the prowess it takes to just beat them now
[02:55:46.940 --> 02:55:53.260]  how the hell vox did we get to this point with a cult of of of just of just savage evil because
[02:55:53.260 --> 02:56:01.820]  those babies are so close to god because we wanted to pursue what we wanted to do you know we wanted
[02:56:01.820 --> 02:56:09.740]  to be our own gods we wanted to pursue our lives of pleasure we wanted to do our drugs and and have
[02:56:09.740 --> 02:56:14.540]  our sex and all that sort of thing and i'm just as guilty of that as anybody else but
[02:56:14.540 --> 02:56:23.900]  you know you have to look beyond that you have to look beyond what your will is and start to try to
[02:56:23.900 --> 02:56:30.700]  understand what god's will is and and that's when the change happens and that is the change that they
[02:56:30.700 --> 02:56:36.140]  fear happening in everybody's life exactly the satanist you've escaped them the devil takes
[02:56:36.140 --> 02:56:42.540]  your will but but god you have to give your will over willingly and god just doesn't do it
[02:56:42.540 --> 02:56:47.900]  automatically it takes a long time before people even get into god's will but it is
[02:56:47.900 --> 02:56:55.340]  that they fear you're absolutely right vox well that's why christianity has always been the enemy
[02:56:55.340 --> 02:57:05.420]  of the the world and that's why it's so ironic that they try to mock us by saying well people
[02:57:05.420 --> 02:57:11.340]  don't approve of you people are laughing at you the world rejects you and that's what we want
[02:57:11.340 --> 02:57:18.060]  that's what we should be pursuing when when when we are getting attacked when we are getting rejected
[02:57:18.860 --> 02:57:23.100]  then we know that we are over the target then we have confidence that we're coming right back
[02:57:23.100 --> 02:57:26.380]  we'll do five more minutes and i'm not bragging because it's almost embarrassing when they offered
[02:57:26.380 --> 02:57:31.740]  me starring roles in hollywood and multi-million dollar contracts they couldn't believe when i turned
[02:57:31.740 --> 02:57:35.980]  it down because it was like they were giving me their god and then once i turned it down it went
[02:57:35.980 --> 02:57:41.660]  from kind of like halfway i wanted to do it to like a joke i mean once i turned it all down i was
[02:57:41.660 --> 02:57:52.300]  like of course i turned it down the spirit was broken the real red pill plus ladies and gentlemen

[03:00:13.900 --> 03:00:16.460]  along the line we lost our innocence so god sent us back
[03:00:19.020 --> 03:00:26.060]  planet earth is time for us if you are receiving this transmission you are the resistance
[03:00:26.700 --> 03:00:33.740]  alive from already been there broadcasting already been here it's alex jones and it'd be fixed
[03:00:36.860 --> 03:00:41.020]  it's up to you box you've really impressed me i'm not just saying that because
[03:00:41.020 --> 03:00:47.420]  i am somebody who just tries to seek out for the truth and find out
[03:00:48.300 --> 03:00:53.260]  what's happening and i look at the people that serve this system they are anti human
[03:00:53.260 --> 03:00:58.220]  they're anti god they're anti success they're losers they're like a cancer like you said
[03:00:58.940 --> 03:01:04.780]  so what do you expect him to do now do you agree with me that i think this last few days there's
[03:01:04.780 --> 03:01:11.740]  a major turning point spiritually where they've gone into pure horror mode and i want to respect
[03:01:11.740 --> 03:01:16.140]  their demonic power i don't support it or like it but i i don't want to be confident like they are
[03:01:16.140 --> 03:01:21.500]  i want to be meek and humble and focused and ready with my guns up you know politically ready
[03:01:22.700 --> 03:01:25.020]  at the same time i know i can't do it all it's god
[03:01:26.460 --> 03:01:29.900]  what is the essence of what you're trying to say to listeners and viewers about where we are
[03:01:29.900 --> 03:01:39.660]  are at this jump point in history where we are is just past the peak of the evil pendulum in my
[03:01:39.660 --> 03:01:46.300]  opinion you know for the past 200 years if you look at robert prector's socionomic theory
[03:01:47.740 --> 03:01:53.100]  things have continued to proceed towards what they call openness we just went over the top
[03:01:53.100 --> 03:02:01.100]  yes we just went over the top and we are just beginning to swing back and so that means that
[03:02:01.100 --> 03:02:09.020]  all the openness all the all the free trade all the no borders all the all the you know
[03:02:09.020 --> 03:02:16.460]  mixed race this and multiracial that all of that is going to reverse and it's going to hard reverse
[03:02:16.460 --> 03:02:22.380]  and so europe is a little bit ahead of the us right now the the national and by the way the
[03:02:22.380 --> 03:02:27.900]  generation z is on fire with that they're already they already pick it up there it's it's done oh
[03:02:27.900 --> 03:02:34.380]  there's no question you know i play um i play soccer at a club i'm obviously quite old so i
[03:02:34.380 --> 03:02:39.180]  play with the veterans but the way that works here all the all the different ages have the different
[03:02:39.180 --> 03:02:46.860]  teams that are part of the same club and i would say that of the sort of 18 to 25 year old crowd
[03:02:46.860 --> 03:02:54.860]  um that they almost uniformly would be classified as really hard right i mean to the extent that
[03:02:54.860 --> 03:03:01.820]  they kind of make me blink a little bit and so that nationalism is on the rise uh everywhere
[03:03:01.820 --> 03:03:06.300]  no exactly i'm in airports and stuff and like good-looking black kid white kid his panic
[03:03:06.300 --> 03:03:10.620]  kids come over and like checks me on something i said that i wasn't and i don't i don't put
[03:03:10.620 --> 03:03:17.660]  them down for it it's orthodoxy they're like really trying to be pure oh yeah i mean i love it when
[03:03:17.660 --> 03:03:22.140]  people are getting on my case and they're saying you know vox you're you're too much of a cock
[03:03:22.140 --> 03:03:29.900]  you're too soft and it's invariably somebody who's 20 or you know has no idea how extreme i am considered
[03:03:30.540 --> 03:03:34.700]  you know among my generation well and they don't understand that yeah they don't know what comes
[03:03:34.700 --> 03:03:42.940]  with it but it's fine and and it's encouraging i love to see it you know the you see the um
[03:03:43.740 --> 03:03:48.220]  the the way that you know the the french national team they tried to make the globalist tried to
[03:03:48.220 --> 03:03:55.020]  make a big push for oh isn't this great isn't this multicultural and you know the memes just the the
[03:03:55.020 --> 03:04:01.420]  anti globalist anti multicultural memes just absolutely swarmed them and it was a beautiful
[03:04:01.420 --> 03:04:05.980]  thing to see exactly it's not like some man marries a woman from a different culture or
[03:04:05.980 --> 03:04:11.180]  and it's beautiful that's great it's that it's forced and that they don't want people to assimilate
[03:04:11.180 --> 03:04:15.340]  i want to do five more minutes with you on the side and ask what you think of donald trump and i
[03:04:15.340 --> 03:04:21.900]  want your real assessment because i haven't figured trump out yet my gut tells me he's good my spirit
[03:04:21.900 --> 03:04:29.580]  does he's he's delivered on somebody fronts but i i really think donald trump is i actually know
[03:04:29.580 --> 03:04:37.660]  no donald trump is like an oracle he's not even there uh donald trump is like i don't know how
[03:04:37.660 --> 03:04:45.340]  to quantify it or describe it but donald trump is like a basically like a psychic precog he's like
[03:04:45.900 --> 03:04:51.740]  he's just the will of the people it's something very special about trump he he's definitely though

[03:07:31.420 --> 03:07:36.460]  i'm like oh comic books no that's that's the seed as he said the aniseed and
[03:07:38.060 --> 03:07:40.860]  to the movies the culture the archetypes we'll talk about that some
[03:07:42.140 --> 03:07:47.020]  before our next guest dose takes over nick baggis dr nick baggis that's a pioneer
[03:07:47.020 --> 03:07:52.460]  and we did tweet out a little special thing their folks did of me uh and a kind of a metamorphosized
[03:07:52.460 --> 03:07:57.100]  archetype there of the warrior now live best selling comic author editor and video game
[03:07:57.100 --> 03:08:04.060]  designer vox day joins today's broadcast to explain his pro-west work including the sjw free
[03:08:04.060 --> 03:08:11.500]  alternative to their garbage comics and their cult but but trump the paradox because i frankly
[03:08:11.500 --> 03:08:17.260]  trump can get his feelings hurt and and and trump does see a lot of the show and and none of us are
[03:08:17.260 --> 03:08:23.660]  perfect but i've always noticed that trump can get manipulated into something but then he always
[03:08:23.660 --> 03:08:28.060]  turns around later and he has this underdog thing as a billionaire he's one of the only
[03:08:28.060 --> 03:08:33.020]  self-made billionaires out there his dad was a big john bird society guy i knew that from sources
[03:08:33.020 --> 03:08:37.580]  then looked it up was the new york times like 30 years ago that you know he would like go beat up
[03:08:37.580 --> 03:08:42.060]  you know communists and stuff in like the 50s and like john wane would do but i don't want to
[03:08:42.060 --> 03:08:54.780]  lionize trump i think he is very interesting and uh obviously very intuitive very connected very
[03:08:54.780 --> 03:09:03.980]  dialed in and pro-human and i fear him so much but then um i've talked to trump a lot many times
[03:09:03.980 --> 03:09:10.460]  and he it's it's like he finishes the sentences before you make him and it's it's very actually
[03:09:10.460 --> 03:09:17.260]  frightening and and then they're telling him an idiot and let me tell you something if if trump
[03:09:17.260 --> 03:09:25.980]  is bad he can deceive my spirit and i've never had my gut be wrong my spirit so my spirit says
[03:09:25.980 --> 03:09:30.300]  get behind trump from the time he ran i just said i just have to get behind him and i've not been
[03:09:30.300 --> 03:09:35.980]  given some delusion i love god i love the babies i love the children i but at the same time even the
[03:09:35.980 --> 03:09:41.020]  elect could be deceived as they say in revelation so fox what do you say about trump and who he is
[03:09:41.020 --> 03:09:44.700]  because a lot of christians say well he's not perfect because you know he's a wrecking ball
[03:09:44.700 --> 03:09:47.900]  well he never said he didn't like women or whatever you know he's not screwing kids there's
[03:09:47.900 --> 03:09:54.700]  no nothing to that a little bit bad he's like i'm trying to like quantify who is trump who is this
[03:09:54.700 --> 03:10:04.060]  guy he's a man with a mission he's a man with a mission i see him as very similar to the apostle
[03:10:04.060 --> 03:10:11.580]  paul um i think that he had a road to demascus experience except that instead of instead of
[03:10:11.580 --> 03:10:17.660]  seeing the face of jesus i think that he saw the face of evil and i think that you just
[03:10:17.660 --> 03:10:22.140]  impressed me again i've talked to people a year before political publishing about him in scotland
[03:10:22.140 --> 03:10:27.980]  for a year he was worldly and and still loved his dad and didn't know it was true and didn't and then
[03:10:27.980 --> 03:10:33.900]  he had this huge experience it's funny were you told this did you know this fox no i just observed
[03:10:33.900 --> 03:10:40.620]  it well i will i will reveal here that trump was haunted for two years had nightmares you name and
[03:10:40.620 --> 03:10:45.660]  i was told this by people very close to the president and uh that he wasn't it wasn't that he
[03:10:45.660 --> 03:10:50.860]  was anti christian he was just his own guy and thought everything was be he had a road to the
[03:10:50.860 --> 03:10:58.620]  masses experience but it was accompanied first by massive demonic assault but but part of that
[03:10:58.620 --> 03:11:05.260]  assault was he was given the opportunity to become part of the evil elite that you talk about a lot
[03:11:06.140 --> 03:11:12.620]  you know they they were welcoming they tried to welcome him into it and he rejected it and i
[03:11:12.620 --> 03:11:17.900]  think this is fairly common knowledge he banned brian eppstein from and you know what he told me
[03:11:17.900 --> 03:11:25.420]  i'll hold you next seven after but this is so powerful trump said the energy he said he said
[03:11:25.420 --> 03:11:30.620]  christians the energy alex is so pure it's so good and it was like i was like something like
[03:11:30.620 --> 03:11:35.980]  autistic person and i was like what do you mean mr mr president elect and mr president goes well
[03:11:35.980 --> 03:11:41.500]  it's just the christians are so good i just want christians to be able to be free and i said sir
[03:11:41.500 --> 03:11:45.900]  i'm not on some big agenda on the whole first amendment deal i believe in it but i i get there
[03:11:45.900 --> 03:11:52.220]  and he was just he kept saying he he he he definitely had that conversion about three years
[03:11:52.220 --> 03:11:58.460]  before he ran and vox very intuitive what you said because i've never told that on air i'm sorry i'm
[03:11:58.460 --> 03:12:05.020]  ranting go ahead well when you look at the things that he said during the campaign when he said when
[03:12:05.020 --> 03:12:12.300]  he talked about how uh i will take the arrows for you he understood the risks that he was taking
[03:12:12.300 --> 03:12:19.660]  he understood that he was setting himself up against the evil powers of the world but what
[03:12:19.660 --> 03:12:25.260]  does that say about him because the average globalist would just take energy he recognized christ
[03:12:25.260 --> 03:12:30.380]  energy is the best thing he never had and he never really had it till he was like 65 years old
[03:12:30.380 --> 03:12:33.980]  that's what i'm saying but what was that but it's it but it's but it's even more significant than
[03:12:33.980 --> 03:12:37.900]  that because if you look at what he is doing and what he has said and what he's willing to do
[03:12:38.620 --> 03:12:45.020]  you know he is literally willing to lay down his career his life his legacy everything
[03:12:45.020 --> 03:12:51.580]  in order to try to set the american people free and you just had it two years ago that's love
[03:12:51.580 --> 03:12:56.380]  two years ago that that's what i said on air i'm not going to get into private conversations
[03:12:56.380 --> 03:13:02.380]  he said he goes i don't care i'm just going to follow this no matter i know it's the answer
[03:13:02.380 --> 03:13:08.060]  just like connie west said when they met those two are like mine he said that vox he said i'm
[03:13:08.060 --> 03:13:14.060]  going to follow this i don't care where it goes i'm not thinking about it anymore i'm just going with
[03:13:15.820 --> 03:13:22.860]  this and that's why the powers of the world fear him because what he is following
[03:13:23.580 --> 03:13:29.580]  is antithetically opposed to them and what he is following whether he understands or not
[03:13:29.580 --> 03:13:37.980]  is apparently the will of god and that's why so many christians respond so powerfully
[03:13:37.980 --> 03:13:44.700]  and so emotionally to him you know i mean you know i predicted the trump slide you can see this
[03:13:44.700 --> 03:13:52.220]  was the old trump slide 2016 shirt um you know i believe that he was going to win from the moment
[03:13:52.220 --> 03:14:00.140]  that i that i heard him um taking that frankly very christ-like position which coming from a
[03:14:00.140 --> 03:14:07.580]  worldly playboy like himself well let's take malania she is a real she is a real christian
[03:14:07.580 --> 03:14:14.460]  i mean and like a bible thomper she loves god and like she did that uh you know famous prayer she
[03:14:14.460 --> 03:14:20.380]  did the lord's prayer up there i mean i mean that's what this is and we're not just saying this
[03:14:20.380 --> 03:14:25.980]  that's why they're so scared is that we've got somebody who isn't worshiping himself he's already
[03:14:25.980 --> 03:14:32.700]  had everything and he's dialed into that and more importantly he's not a fraud he's not a fake like
[03:14:32.700 --> 03:14:38.700]  the bushes were you know the the bushes purported to be you know christians too and that sort of thing
[03:14:39.260 --> 03:14:45.740]  but nothing that they did ever really struck me as being genuine i agree let's do one more segment
[03:14:45.740 --> 03:14:48.780]  i'm going to shut up give me the floor for the next segment and then i really appreciate
[03:14:48.780 --> 03:14:53.020]  dr nick baggage former senator brother congressman father great page for the expose the whole
[03:14:53.020 --> 03:14:58.540]  paradigm he's coming up for two segments after that but that what what vox is saying is i don't
[03:14:58.540 --> 03:15:03.020]  want to reveal too much here on air but i i i mean i can just tell you right now that
[03:15:03.980 --> 03:15:09.820]  trump did have a road to the mascus event two years about yeah i say five years was
[03:15:10.380 --> 03:15:16.060]  now but it's been three years since the campaign started he had a road to the mascus event and
[03:15:16.060 --> 03:15:21.340]  exactly what you said and trump was like none of this fulfills me hollywood all these things are
[03:15:21.340 --> 03:15:27.260]  fake i've already conquered all these things and it's not real he said i mean i'll tell you a big
[03:15:27.260 --> 03:15:32.460]  secret uh trump like says hey can we go to black churches someone asked vox day that question we
[03:15:32.460 --> 03:15:37.180]  come back like people on the campaign and the new campaign go trump goes hey uh i'm gonna go black
[03:15:37.180 --> 03:15:42.860]  churches and they go why he goes he goes i've never felt so much energy as a black church and it's
[03:15:42.860 --> 03:15:49.740]  not some condescending thing trump loves black churches what does that say he literally asked to
[03:15:49.740 --> 03:15:57.820]  be directed to them what does that mean you have been lied to my name is kevin ship i'm a former

[03:17:59.900 --> 03:18:05.260]  leilanias states but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned
[03:18:05.260 --> 03:18:12.380]  about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower
[03:18:12.380 --> 03:18:19.100]  the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals
[03:18:19.100 --> 03:18:25.100]  alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and
[03:18:25.100 --> 03:18:31.740]  acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our alexa pure gravity filter and not only
[03:18:31.740 --> 03:18:38.220]  were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph was also restored to optimal levels
[03:18:38.220 --> 03:18:44.460]  as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises the ph of the water so what we've learned is
[03:18:44.460 --> 03:18:50.940]  that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply but more importantly a good
[03:18:50.940 --> 03:18:56.700]  water filtration system will purify it in full wars life is launching its newest product we're

[03:20:26.620 --> 03:20:32.220]  we've got uh dr. nick back it's taken over but i was just getting into the fact that trump doesn't
[03:20:32.220 --> 03:20:37.100]  like go oh i love jesus oh are you a good christian do you love the lord all that kind of stuff that's
[03:20:37.100 --> 03:20:42.380]  talking to me and others he's like oh i really love these churches and the energy it's so good
[03:20:42.380 --> 03:20:47.500]  it's better than a rock concert you're like hearing that but it's like god he's resonating with that
[03:20:47.500 --> 03:20:52.780]  energy so just in closing we'll get you back very soon talk about alt hero uh crackdown we're selling
[03:20:52.780 --> 03:20:57.420]  this is great for kids i'm one of the only libertarian conservative pro patriot pro western
[03:20:58.140 --> 03:21:02.940]  comic books out there it's amazing very honored to be selling that in four store dot com box day
[03:21:02.940 --> 03:21:07.740]  but just just in closing it's not a trump roble fest you know a man by his enemies
[03:21:07.740 --> 03:21:14.140]  i just gave you the intel from behind the scene stuff about trump particularly liking black churches
[03:21:14.140 --> 03:21:17.980]  and i and that's got a lot of connotations to it but just what do you make of that
[03:21:19.900 --> 03:21:26.460]  well i think that trump just loves people who are filled with the holy spirit and love the lord
[03:21:26.460 --> 03:21:33.340]  and he it calls to him and you know i've certainly seen that and i've seen that in black churches
[03:21:33.340 --> 03:21:38.620]  i've seen that in italian churches um you know the more the more expressive of people are
[03:21:39.420 --> 03:21:46.060]  often the more uplifting it is and i expect that that sort of thing really uh appeals to
[03:21:46.060 --> 03:21:51.420]  the president in his heart all right they're trying to censor your comic book but it's still
[03:21:51.420 --> 03:21:55.740]  the number one on amazon people can buy it there if they want in four store dot com but come back
[03:21:55.740 --> 03:22:01.340]  let's talk about the cultural revolution against them it's going in 60 seconds you agree they're in
[03:22:01.340 --> 03:22:05.580]  trouble they're desperate they're scared let's not be too confident what do they launch i think
[03:22:05.580 --> 03:22:10.380]  false flags to make themselves victims which is why i think it was wrong i did the whole joke about
[03:22:10.380 --> 03:22:15.820]  molar and shooting in which i said it's a joke it's not real it's metaphorical they still edited it
[03:22:15.820 --> 03:22:20.380]  out to kind of say do that they're the ones calling for violence i what are you concerned about
[03:22:20.380 --> 03:22:26.780]  uh i'm actually more focused on on the what's going to happen to folks on the financial side
[03:22:27.500 --> 03:22:32.060]  i think that that's a obvious point of vulnerability and i'm that's why i'm glad to see that
[03:22:33.340 --> 03:22:38.540]  trump and the and his administration are starting to look at big social and to look at the
[03:22:39.340 --> 03:22:43.820]  payment processors and that sort of thing because that's that is going to be one of the primary
[03:22:43.820 --> 03:22:51.660]  uh focuses of attack absolutely i mean you've had bill marr all of them say what we already knew
[03:22:51.660 --> 03:22:56.780]  crashed the economy to stop america's recovery if that isn't treason if that is an espionage
[03:22:56.780 --> 03:23:00.540]  so what does the president do we don't want to be a dictator we want him to have the will
[03:23:00.540 --> 03:23:05.020]  of the people in constitution but what do you do when you've got multi nationals chi-com openly
[03:23:05.020 --> 03:23:10.380]  funded chinese president dictator goes to davos says don't worry we're working with hollywood
[03:23:10.380 --> 03:23:16.620]  will f america over i mean you know we're like chomps if we put up with that exactly he's doing
[03:23:16.620 --> 03:23:21.420]  the right thing he's and the chinese respect that you know i was on chinese english language
[03:23:21.420 --> 03:23:26.620]  television about in march and you know they really respect the fact that trump is the first
[03:23:26.620 --> 03:23:30.940]  president to actually be representing american interests and so the the more that he speaks
[03:23:30.940 --> 03:23:35.820]  the truth and the more that he stands strong the better position that americans are going to be
[03:23:35.820 --> 03:23:41.260]  all right vox day thanks for the time we really appreciate you talk to you soon thanks alex and
[03:23:41.260 --> 03:23:46.780]  that's it our media says the chi-coms hate us and our media says all this they are like
[03:23:46.780 --> 03:23:51.820]  Putin everybody are like uh we have russian interests we have american interests uh we actually
[03:23:51.820 --> 03:23:57.340]  like this we we want human interests but the globalists they want dysfunction they want failure
[03:23:57.340 --> 03:24:02.140]  they want poverty they want control when somebody who spearheaded this with his father
[03:24:02.140 --> 03:24:06.220]  was a famous congressman and of course his brother was a u.s senator but in his own right he's the
[03:24:06.220 --> 03:24:10.140]  best-selling author and i think we're successful in his father and his brother and i mean to
[03:24:10.140 --> 03:24:15.660]  mention the accolades of his genetic compass but dr nick baggages here taking over right now
[03:24:16.220 --> 03:24:23.980]  where would you say exposing you know up front the whole spy grid the whole shadow system but
[03:24:23.980 --> 03:24:29.340]  if we got leaders in charge that wanted to use technology to empower people instead of enslaving
[03:24:29.340 --> 03:24:34.220]  people i think the stars are the limit uh and you know there's time enough for love there's time
[03:24:34.220 --> 03:24:40.860]  enough for anything once we beat that it's not some valhalla it's not some nirvana it's not some
[03:24:40.860 --> 03:24:46.780]  utopia we're offering like all the communists do it's a real human experience chance so go
[03:24:46.780 --> 03:24:51.580]  ahead and take over of course old earth pulse dot com find your books and videos we love you
[03:24:51.580 --> 03:24:56.860]  we appreciate you as a trailblazer all this but how would you quantify the the the cultural the
[03:24:56.860 --> 03:25:03.900]  economic the spiritual moment we're at right now this is um the the moment i think we've all been
[03:25:03.900 --> 03:25:09.340]  waiting for this is the turning point where we really have an opportunity uh to see this thing
[03:25:09.340 --> 03:25:13.420]  change in a different direction and i think that's where we're at and you know you and i've worked
[03:25:13.420 --> 03:25:19.020]  together uh a really long time i was thinking about this you know we started about the same time
[03:25:19.020 --> 03:25:25.980]  in the early 90s moving uh an agenda forward that really transferred power back to the governed
[03:25:25.980 --> 03:25:31.420]  which is the government you know when you really think about it and all of this uh political
[03:25:31.420 --> 03:25:39.340]  correctness is stifling speech um the idea of a controlling speech i find the most uh disheartening
[03:25:39.340 --> 03:25:45.900]  thing because what we're offered now is a chance to reclaim the territory of personal privacy which
[03:25:45.900 --> 03:25:52.300]  now extends uh into the digital doorway past our physical doorways and all of our digital
[03:25:52.300 --> 03:25:59.820]  and notice just the debate about that is killing facebook today yes indeed and as it should
[03:25:59.820 --> 03:26:07.660]  because institutions that take on the ability to have open free absolutely free dialogue
[03:26:07.660 --> 03:26:13.580]  even even when what someone is saying might be repugnant to us whether it be on the left
[03:26:13.580 --> 03:26:21.500]  or the right we need to be able to say that the right to speak the right to articulate our arguments
[03:26:21.500 --> 03:26:27.900]  can't be um infringed especially in a digital world where our life is i mean think about it
[03:26:27.900 --> 03:26:32.860]  what's in your house is very little in terms of the information about you not letting us on the
[03:26:32.860 --> 03:26:39.500]  digital system is like not providing oxygen to somebody right i mean it's so fundamental it's
[03:26:39.500 --> 03:26:46.940]  the very first uh thing spoken about in the in the first amendment is freedom of speech freedom of
[03:26:46.940 --> 03:26:53.260]  assembly the modern assembly is in fact the internet to infringe that is to step uh in the
[03:26:53.260 --> 03:26:57.740]  middle of every adversarial voice and notice how it's blowing up in their face that they would
[03:26:57.740 --> 03:27:05.660]  assault it absolutely and and this is the real market factors when you recognize them they don't
[03:27:05.660 --> 03:27:12.060]  just exist in economies where they exist they exist in ideas first exactly right fundamental
[03:27:12.060 --> 03:27:19.660]  government springs from us the people uh the human souls we decide collectively how it's
[03:27:19.660 --> 03:27:26.060]  shaped how it's formed and globalists hate this the elite hates us and they set up institutions
[03:27:26.060 --> 03:27:31.260]  that they call democratic that aren't even democratic think about the eu the european union
[03:27:31.260 --> 03:27:36.220]  the european parliament nobody elects a single person there and they call that a democratic
[03:27:36.220 --> 03:27:41.580]  institution give me a break you know this is representation by the grand side of the most
[03:27:41.580 --> 03:27:46.140]  powerful nazis i mean it's it's literally insane you're taking over right now but dr nick baggage

[03:33:23.980 --> 03:33:29.180]  and welcome back to info wars dot com and this is uh dr nick baggage and i'm standing in for
[03:33:29.180 --> 03:33:37.500]  this last few segments of today's broadcast and i you know i really appreciate alex as a disruptor
[03:33:37.500 --> 03:33:41.980]  you know that's how i would i would categorize a lot of us we're disruptors you know we kind of
[03:33:41.980 --> 03:33:49.420]  walk into the middle of the room and and present new information that sort of puts a ranch in your
[03:33:49.420 --> 03:33:54.780]  bike bicycle spokes of the new world order as it's going downhill at a pretty high velocity
[03:33:54.780 --> 03:33:59.980]  and and i totally appreciate that about alex you know and i get comments and i read all the
[03:33:59.980 --> 03:34:05.580]  comments and sometimes when he and i are on we're both so excited about what we're talking about
[03:34:06.380 --> 03:34:11.660]  that you know we kind of run over each other a little bit and and people sometimes get critical
[03:34:11.660 --> 03:34:19.180]  of that and don't really don't because this is the nature of a disruptor at our core we get excited
[03:34:19.180 --> 03:34:25.020]  and we just can't help ourselves and that's just the nature of it and and you know this is what
[03:34:25.020 --> 03:34:31.100]  needs to be preserved in uh in the in the idea of freedom of speech true freedom of speech means
[03:34:31.740 --> 03:34:36.940]  that the that the engagement happens on the platform of the 21st century and this is what's
[03:34:36.940 --> 03:34:43.020]  being attacked that's why facebook's book stock is plunging today as people with a different
[03:34:43.020 --> 03:34:47.900]  political view than the owners are saying you know what we're not spending our time effort or energy
[03:34:47.900 --> 03:34:54.060]  with you if you cannot recognize our right uh to be uh and to speak and to and to do those things
[03:34:54.060 --> 03:34:58.220]  that we that we feel are important to us and you know and and i think that's what's more important
[03:34:58.220 --> 03:35:03.660]  to preserve what i travel a lot all over the world i spend a good bit of time uh in europe and and
[03:35:03.660 --> 03:35:10.460]  what i see in europe is the result of political speech in the backlash of that suppression uh
[03:35:10.460 --> 03:35:16.460]  that they call tolerance in this liberal liberal left-wing sort of view of oh we're so tolerant you
[03:35:16.460 --> 03:35:22.620]  know we're so generous with our generosity of tolerance you know tolerance and i've said this
[03:35:22.620 --> 03:35:31.740]  before is self violence because you're suppressing your truth that's a violent act against yourself
[03:35:31.740 --> 03:35:36.300]  against divinity if you believe you're created in the image and like as god it's just as bad
[03:35:36.300 --> 03:35:43.180]  is attacking someone else only it's an internal feeding to shut down your ability to speak unless
[03:35:43.180 --> 03:35:49.420]  you're speaking for an established order that tells you what to pair whether it's the left or the
[03:35:49.420 --> 03:35:54.940]  right quite frankly this is what we need to guard against is that true freedom of speech is saying
[03:35:54.940 --> 03:36:00.220]  what we believe is right and true in a respectful way that doesn't incite violence but in incite
[03:36:00.220 --> 03:36:05.340]  dialogue you know that was old point freedom of the press and freedom of speech were not
[03:36:05.340 --> 03:36:13.180]  the fundamentals of the first amendment for no reason they were to infuse to invigorate
[03:36:14.140 --> 03:36:20.220]  public debate and public dialogue that takes us to deeper conclusions that represent the
[03:36:20.220 --> 03:36:25.820]  true american character and they don't happen by us you know having our own civil wars every 15
[03:36:25.820 --> 03:36:34.460]  minutes no they happen by recognition and respect not some artificial thing called tolerance but
[03:36:34.460 --> 03:36:41.260]  respect and acceptance of an opposing view even if it's repugnant to you and the right to say it
[03:36:41.260 --> 03:36:49.100]  because once you start deciding what the level of acceptability is the whole thing collapses
[03:36:49.100 --> 03:36:56.620]  because then it's just one more slippery slope down the slippery slope of a really different
[03:36:56.620 --> 03:37:03.020]  kind of government and they're using nationalism fighting in our own individual self-interest
[03:37:03.020 --> 03:37:08.940]  as reflected within our cultures within our countries and right now i mean globalism is
[03:37:08.940 --> 03:37:14.220]  certainly the hope of god that we all come together sometime but we're not there ladies and gentlemen
[03:37:14.220 --> 03:37:19.980]  and anyone who thinks we are at this moment is deluded the fact is our cultures are very different
[03:37:19.980 --> 03:37:25.580]  the way we perceive the world is very different and that has not changed right away and it won't
[03:37:25.580 --> 03:37:33.180]  change for probably a few more hundred years but the reality is we are a very different population
[03:37:33.180 --> 03:37:39.180]  america has gone from a country of example where we did our own thing and and only came out of our
[03:37:39.180 --> 03:37:44.140]  box when we were threatened truly threatened now we're engaged in everyone's affair and people are
[03:37:44.140 --> 03:37:52.460]  upset about russia's engagement uh perhaps in busting hillary's server and the democrat servers
[03:37:52.460 --> 03:37:59.660]  you know personally i don't find it a as big a problem as a lot of others because we do it
[03:38:00.700 --> 03:38:06.700]  to over 120 countries all the time we even tap our national leaders of our allies um
[03:38:06.700 --> 03:38:13.980]  merkel was being tapped you know all of them and and and and why is now we're so self-righteous
[03:38:13.980 --> 03:38:18.940]  about this because russia's doing it how naive are we you know if we don't think russia's doing
[03:38:18.940 --> 03:38:24.060]  this and china's doing this and even israel and every other major power the french the british
[03:38:24.060 --> 03:38:33.660]  the us germany everyone is using their technology for their own nationalistic advantage if they're
[03:38:33.660 --> 03:38:37.500]  not they're working against people that elected them and that's where we ended that last segment
[03:38:37.500 --> 03:38:42.540]  with alex was the e you european part of we hear him quoted all the time the european commission
[03:38:42.540 --> 03:38:48.860]  quoted all the time these are appointed people nobody elected them they are not the voice
[03:38:48.860 --> 03:38:55.180]  of the people by any stretch of the imagination they are the voice of the elite the same as the
[03:38:55.180 --> 03:39:01.500]  un the biggest bribery cooking operation in the world operating out of new york with mostly our
[03:39:01.500 --> 03:39:07.580]  money another group nobody elected they're all appointed telling the rest of the world what to
[03:39:07.580 --> 03:39:17.180]  do i'm i'm sorry fundamentally it does not reach the level of democracy in a republic
[03:39:17.180 --> 03:39:23.660]  that i embrace as an american adult in fact it flies in the face of what i believe government
[03:39:23.660 --> 03:39:30.780]  springs from the people and this does not this springs from the elite of the elite and you know
[03:39:30.780 --> 03:39:35.740]  and i got three generations in government right my my dad was a congressman my brother was a mayor
[03:39:35.740 --> 03:39:40.540]  in a u.s senator my other brother's a state senator and one of my brothers is running for
[03:39:40.540 --> 03:39:45.980]  governor right now here in alaska so i mean we've seen it from pre-state statehood from what it's
[03:39:45.980 --> 03:39:50.140]  like to be a territory all the way through the evolution of a state which we're in the middle
[03:39:50.140 --> 03:39:58.780]  of way behind a lot of my my brethren around the around the united states um but having said all
[03:39:58.780 --> 03:40:10.220]  that now is the time um to stand up to preserve speech and and use your economic power as citizens
[03:40:10.220 --> 03:40:15.740]  to do that we're seeing it with facebook maybe this will wake up people to the idea that speech
[03:40:16.540 --> 03:40:22.700]  needs to be protected and then on the back side of this from these big operators personal privacy
[03:40:22.700 --> 03:40:29.180]  your digital doorway belongs to us individually and here's how i think it should work is my opinion
[03:40:30.140 --> 03:40:36.700]  we shouldn't be allowed to opt in or opt out of anything that invades our privacy it ought not to
[03:40:36.700 --> 03:40:42.380]  be allowed to be asked in other words the average person who might not be as well informed on how
[03:40:42.380 --> 03:40:50.380]  all this electronics actually works shouldn't even be able to say yeah i give up my freedom no no one

[03:41:45.340 --> 03:41:51.980]  just taken six or seven hundred documents um and distilling them uh down uh and and that's the nature

[03:47:22.700 --> 03:47:27.820]  and you know when we left off i was talking about these unelected groups that somehow
[03:47:27.820 --> 03:47:32.140]  think they represent us and you know i've done a lot of work as i said in in europe and around
[03:47:32.140 --> 03:47:38.220]  the world so i see a lot firsthand and i watch i mean i watched the euro come in and what people
[03:47:38.220 --> 03:47:43.740]  were really saying about that and sort of that was in the 90s and then kind of what's happened
[03:47:43.740 --> 03:47:48.460]  since this people's economy has literally been hijacked you know and i was i was listening
[03:47:48.460 --> 03:47:53.820]  to the segment earlier today where they had a a blip on there from rand paul talking about
[03:47:53.820 --> 03:47:58.860]  bringing the troops home talking about the budgets you know and the tax issues anything about what
[03:47:58.860 --> 03:48:03.180]  trump has done already you know the tax issues consumer confidence stock market all the big
[03:48:03.180 --> 03:48:09.340]  measures unemployment across all of the uh ethnic groups you know we're seeing all those improvements
[03:48:09.340 --> 03:48:13.980]  and then i saw a recent one with tax receipts are down but i don't think we've seen the full
[03:48:13.980 --> 03:48:19.500]  measure of that let's wait and see how that all rolls up but when when i started thinking about
[03:48:19.500 --> 03:48:23.900]  things that are happening that are going to affect us on the long range like the in the EU
[03:48:23.900 --> 03:48:30.300]  getting nato to pay their bills and belly up to the bar and get some money on the table i'm talking
[03:48:30.300 --> 03:48:36.300]  to a friend of mine who's staff in the european parliament been there over 20 20 years and the
[03:48:36.300 --> 03:48:41.580]  insight that this person brought to me in a three or four hour conversation just as this was
[03:48:41.580 --> 03:48:47.020]  happening in brussels a few weeks ago and it was interesting an insider who comes originally from
[03:48:47.020 --> 03:48:54.380]  eastern europe this person has a undergraduate in economics a masters in economics and a doctorate
[03:48:54.380 --> 03:49:01.020]  in economics and very smart person and the basic view expressed there was yeah europe ought to pay
[03:49:01.020 --> 03:49:07.420]  its own bills and trump used the number 90 percent we're paying 90 percent the actual number according
[03:49:07.420 --> 03:49:14.060]  to the insiders on this for nato alone not the whole of europe which might be closer to 90 percent
[03:49:14.060 --> 03:49:21.340]  for the us it's about 67 percent for nato which is not the right number it's truly not the right
[03:49:21.340 --> 03:49:26.860]  number i mean is are we 67 percent of europe's action i don't think so now what did they just
[03:49:26.860 --> 03:49:31.820]  do in this trade agreement one of the things trump called them on was hey you're beating us up over
[03:49:31.820 --> 03:49:37.580]  our relationship with uh moscow but you're getting 70 percent of your natural gas and lights to keep
[03:49:37.580 --> 03:49:45.020]  lights on in germany from moscow so why aren't you buying us natural gas we haven't been exporting it
[03:49:45.020 --> 03:49:50.940]  and if you watch the news the last couple days they are and if you watch our earlier segments on
[03:49:50.940 --> 03:49:55.820]  alaska natural gas and lasco mineral resources i urge you to go back because they're on youtube
[03:49:55.820 --> 03:50:04.300]  they're very easy to find these are the real media issues of balance trade now we get the
[03:50:04.300 --> 03:50:12.060]  report except for automobiles we're going to get to zero uh trade barriers on both sides hey
[03:50:12.940 --> 03:50:19.340]  right on and they're up on the screen 96 percent there's the number 67 percent the real number not
[03:50:19.340 --> 03:50:25.420]  90 and this is important because maybe it should be more like maybe 20 percent or 15 percent i mean
[03:50:25.420 --> 03:50:31.420]  how much of our interest is really in europe who should pay that bill see that's the next thing
[03:50:31.420 --> 03:50:37.180]  that that i think trump can address is the defense budget from the standpoint of what is america's
[03:50:37.180 --> 03:50:42.940]  interest and what is it look at the foreign base situation 850 bases and stations around the world
[03:50:43.820 --> 03:50:52.780]  and we're upset that russia has won in syria you know come on man get real this is the point
[03:50:52.780 --> 03:50:57.500]  nobody pays attention oh look what the other guy's doing you know you got a little uh piece of dust
[03:50:57.500 --> 03:51:02.940]  in your eye well the other guy's got the poll in their eye right this is the story of the media in
[03:51:02.940 --> 03:51:09.980]  the 21st century oh wait wait look over here and uh you know the defense budget is a big
[03:51:10.540 --> 03:51:15.420]  elephant in the room and we also need to measure it against relative productivity not dollars anymore
[03:51:15.420 --> 03:51:20.860]  because when we measure dollars like against china or russia you know china you get 10 times
[03:51:20.860 --> 03:51:27.580]  more productivity so they spend one tenth as much money well that kind of makes sense doesn't it i mean
[03:51:27.580 --> 03:51:31.900]  because what you're looking for is how many battleships do you get how many aircraft carriers and
[03:51:31.900 --> 03:51:37.500]  submarines and missiles it's the output that matters not the input of dollars which is just
[03:51:37.500 --> 03:51:43.340]  a medium between productive resources which gets me into the meat of the next piece of this which
[03:51:43.340 --> 03:51:48.860]  is the money think about what china and india are doing with the money they're going electronic
[03:51:48.860 --> 03:51:55.580]  is you're going to see the first big populations a couple billion plus go electronic money and
[03:51:55.580 --> 03:52:01.500]  i'm not talking bitcoin because they're shutting that down in these countries they're taking digital
[03:52:01.500 --> 03:52:07.740]  images of face eyes and fingerprints and the reason they do all three in india is because
[03:52:07.740 --> 03:52:13.340]  some people have literally worn their fingerprints off or they have cataracts and eye diseases where
[03:52:13.340 --> 03:52:19.820]  you can't get an iris scan so either you all three and they got 1.1 billion of the population last
[03:52:19.820 --> 03:52:25.900]  read i made a few months ago done and a couple hundred million that are still ghosts in the system
[03:52:25.900 --> 03:52:31.740]  because you can't get on social systems welfare programs or any of the things that voting any of
[03:52:31.740 --> 03:52:37.740]  it in india without being in that digital system now so that's the beginning of the mark if you will
[03:52:37.740 --> 03:52:43.020]  for those that know what i'm talking about the next is china which is doing social scoring
[03:52:43.020 --> 03:52:47.820]  in addition to controlling every aspect of their economy and this something people need to also
[03:52:47.820 --> 03:52:57.580]  recognize is capitalism is not something an attribute of democracy capitalism is a system
[03:52:57.580 --> 03:53:04.140]  of economics separate from government so the communist chinese have adopted a capitalistic
[03:53:04.140 --> 03:53:13.660]  economic system to lay underneath their system of government which is a squishy collective whatever
[03:53:13.660 --> 03:53:19.340]  they want to call it you know but it's a different way of looking at governance you know because it's
[03:53:19.340 --> 03:53:23.820]  not a democracy they have the illusion of it you know like the eu has the illusion of it and the
[03:53:23.820 --> 03:53:29.820]  un has the illusion of it but they really represent a different block of elites and the corruption
[03:53:29.820 --> 03:53:36.220]  level in china and india so off the charts that part of this anti-corruption move is to shut down
[03:53:36.220 --> 03:53:42.460]  the leakage in their economies and gain control of it because once they do under the guise of we're
[03:53:42.460 --> 03:53:48.780]  stamping out corruption which people support that concept but they don't realize is in giving up
[03:53:49.660 --> 03:53:55.020]  freedom they gain perhaps a stamp out on corruption but you know this is again getting into the
[03:53:55.020 --> 03:54:00.060]  issue of okay how do you spend your money and how do you develop your economy and what is an
[03:54:00.060 --> 03:54:05.180]  economy and this is where the bankers come into the play and you know we're going to be out of
[03:54:05.180 --> 03:54:09.900]  time today before we get into the the real meat of it but i want to talk about just the foundations
[03:54:09.900 --> 03:54:17.180]  of it so income taxing human beings are labor that was what the civil war in the 1860s was
[03:54:17.180 --> 03:54:24.060]  fought about and then it was determined that taxing of persons labor was unconstitutional in 1894
[03:54:24.060 --> 03:54:29.100]  by the united states supreme court most people don't realize this it took a constitutional
[03:54:29.100 --> 03:54:35.180]  amendment to tax our labor and when they created the income tax at the same time they gave huge
[03:54:35.180 --> 03:54:40.860]  breaks to corporations to the elites of the day the railroad barons all of these guys who were
[03:54:40.860 --> 03:54:45.580]  doing minerals and oil and gas they got a thing called depletion allowance which in an earlier
[03:54:45.580 --> 03:54:52.540]  segment i described pretty pretty in detail but this gave them a 50 basic tax break when they do
[03:54:52.540 --> 03:54:58.860]  their bottom line calculations so when they lower the corporate rate for all corporations to 20%
[03:54:58.860 --> 03:55:04.780]  effectively for oil and gas and minerals it's half of that 10% like a sales tax in some parts of
[03:55:04.780 --> 03:55:08.620]  the country right now and that's what they pay which you know i'm not saying good better and
[03:55:08.620 --> 03:55:14.700]  different but let's be honest about it uh they're depleting public resources not private resources
[03:55:14.700 --> 03:55:20.700]  and depletion allowances should not apply to public resources at all and this uh aberration
[03:55:20.700 --> 03:55:26.860]  in the tax code that now is over a hundred years old uh needs to be uh extracted from the code
[03:55:26.860 --> 03:55:32.540]  and recognize for what it is the biggest loophole that you can drive a semi through but complicated
[03:55:32.540 --> 03:55:37.980]  enough so the average person doesn't get it this is the hijacking that still takes place
[03:55:37.980 --> 03:55:43.420]  and if you want to stop the leakage now you've got tax reform that created a playing field
[03:55:43.420 --> 03:55:48.060]  that's very different we're taxing our multinational corporations for their overseas revenues
[03:55:48.060 --> 03:55:53.820]  great now we can take the next level to stamp out depletion allowances on public resources so
[03:55:53.820 --> 03:56:00.380]  they don't apply anymore and we get the full tax load that's intended that's fair and reasonable
[03:56:00.380 --> 03:56:06.060]  for public resources are being exploited mostly by uh companies that aren't even domiciled here
[03:56:06.620 --> 03:56:11.100]  and we've covered that in past segments under minerals and oil and gas and look at those past
[03:56:11.100 --> 03:56:16.540]  segments and spread those around i mean that's the nature of info wars dot com it is an info war
[03:56:16.540 --> 03:56:22.540]  war the fact is good information factor of an information even drawing it from their sources
[03:56:23.100 --> 03:56:28.780]  so that we can reframe the debate to represent what we need in democratic republics like ours
[03:56:28.780 --> 03:56:34.220]  when we start pulling back as ran poll has suggested our troops from these foreign lands
[03:56:34.220 --> 03:56:40.780]  and adventures without declared wars that are in fact the constitutional purview of the congress
[03:56:40.780 --> 03:56:48.860]  and none of these policing actions or regime change actions have been declared wars now when
[03:56:48.860 --> 03:56:54.460]  you do a regime change which is kind of like a polite way of saying you know we don't like
