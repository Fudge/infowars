[00:00:04.795 --> 00:00:09.639]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.639 --> 00:00:11.220]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:12.161]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:12.161 --> 00:00:16.965]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:16.965 --> 00:00:21.028]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:34.614 --> 00:00:38.276]  Well, here we are, more than halfway into 2009.
[00:00:38.276 --> 00:00:42.879]  It is Wednesday, July 1st, 2009.
[00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:47.482]  We have four hours spanning out before us today.
[00:00:47.482 --> 00:00:58.769]  We're going to have wide open phones throughout the full four hours of transmission on any subject, any news item, any story you wish to discuss, any question you have for me, 1-800-259-9231.
[00:00:58.769 --> 00:00:58.789]  1-800.
[00:01:05.247 --> 00:01:07.372]  259-9231 and we will get you up and on the air.
[00:01:15.811 --> 00:01:17.252]  Where to begin?
[00:01:17.252 --> 00:01:23.957]  We have Alan Watt joining us for two hours today, coming up in the second and third hour, maybe even longer.
[00:01:23.957 --> 00:01:32.263]  We will open the phones up during that interview, and I'm going to try to sit back and let Alan really roll with just a few of my key questions throughout it.
[00:01:32.263 --> 00:01:37.066]  It's always informative to have Alan on with us, so that is coming up in T-minus 59 minutes.
[00:01:40.931 --> 00:02:01.278]  On other fronts, because I just don't want to mention this and then have it kind of glazed over in the background chatter of the other important news I'm covering, we have discovered clear black operations going on against this office specifically.
[00:02:01.278 --> 00:02:05.020]  And I think long-time listeners especially know we don't just come on here and say things.
[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:05.820]  If we say something,
[00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:14.511]  It is almost always accurate and true, and if not, a few times we're wrong, we believe it is accurate and true.
[00:02:14.511 --> 00:02:29.334]  But I have confirmed from multiple sources, over multiple angles, and over my almost 14 years in the media, on the air, as an activist, more than 14 years as an activist, really 15 as an activist, but close to 14 on air.
[00:02:29.334 --> 00:02:33.595]  I've discovered systems, patterns, also a lot of declassified government documents, how this stuff works.
[00:02:34.454 --> 00:02:39.496]  Past examples, news stories when it does leak, how different types of black ops work.
[00:02:39.496 --> 00:02:49.781]  And the establishment is moving against me on multi-fronts right now, and my sixth sense has been in overdrive lately.
[00:02:49.781 --> 00:02:52.262]  And I'm somebody who's actually pretty bold.
[00:02:52.262 --> 00:02:56.484]  I do have quite a bit of almost stupid courage, if I do say so myself.
[00:02:57.432 --> 00:03:03.896]  I sleep pretty well at night when it comes to worrying about my own family and myself and my safety.
[00:03:03.896 --> 00:03:11.300]  I don't sleep well sometimes worried about society itself overall and my children's futures.
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:18.924]  So when my sixth sense starts jumping, and I mean jumping like a buck and bronco that's been thrown into a squeeze chute,
[00:03:21.465 --> 00:03:26.867]  And then I physically, out there in the media and the culture, see the enemy on my six.
[00:03:26.867 --> 00:03:29.949]  You know, not just my six cents, but the enemy's on my six.
[00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:43.735]  That means right behind me, for those that I guess don't know dogfighting definitions and nomenclature, that's when you say they're at 12 o'clock, they're at 3 o'clock, they're at 1 o'clock, they're at 9 o'clock.
[00:03:43.735 --> 00:03:50.798]  You picture yourself right in the center of the watch dial, with the hands sticking out, so 12 o'clock's right out in front of you.
[00:03:52.130 --> 00:04:00.455]  He'd say, up until twelve o'clock, or coming in on your six from under you.
[00:04:00.455 --> 00:04:08.600]  Point is, I got all sorts of bogeys on my six, and they are firing, a lot of them publicly firing on me.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:15.064]  But there's a lot of other bogeys we discovered that shake me a bit.
[00:04:15.064 --> 00:04:17.726]  But that's good, that's what gets me alive, it's what wakes me up.
[00:04:18.717 --> 00:04:22.798]  And I'll tell you, it's exciting to know you're in the service of humanity and the Creator.
[00:04:22.798 --> 00:04:26.238]  It's exciting to know I'm on the side of the good guys.
[00:04:26.238 --> 00:04:41.121]  It's exciting to know that I face media demonization, dirty tricks, physical attacks, and ultimately, the way the track is going, my death.
[00:04:41.121 --> 00:04:45.542]  It is exciting to turn the afterburners on and blast into enemy territory.
[00:04:46.576 --> 00:04:48.277]  Knowing I'm committed.
[00:04:48.277 --> 00:04:52.620]  But I do want to ask for your prayers coming up in about 30 minutes.
[00:04:52.620 --> 00:04:54.881]  Alright, a lot of key news straight ahead.
[00:04:54.881 --> 00:04:56.202]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:04:56.202 --> 00:04:58.143]  This is GCN Radio Network.

[00:06:00.259 --> 00:06:02.721]  The New World Orders War Against Humanity.
[00:06:03.354 --> 00:06:05.956]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:06:05.956 --> 00:06:13.541]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong, just as well-funded.
[00:06:13.541 --> 00:06:19.726]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:06:20.126 --> 00:06:22.107]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:06:22.107 --> 00:06:24.608]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:06:24.608 --> 00:06:36.173]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[00:06:36.173 --> 00:06:37.854]  It's not about left or right.
[00:06:37.854 --> 00:06:39.715]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:06:39.715 --> 00:06:45.938]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[00:06:56.457 --> 00:07:00.258]  The people strike back.
[00:07:00.258 --> 00:07:03.259]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:07:03.259 --> 00:07:08.601]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:10.642]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:07:10.642 --> 00:07:15.384]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:07:15.624 --> 00:07:16.825]  How much do you want?
[00:07:16.825 --> 00:07:17.946]  When do you want it?
[00:07:17.946 --> 00:07:19.828]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:07:19.828 --> 00:07:20.909]  When will you need it?
[00:07:20.909 --> 00:07:23.111]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:07:23.111 --> 00:07:24.432]  Will there be any food?
[00:07:24.432 --> 00:07:25.974]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:07:25.974 --> 00:07:31.239]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:07:31.239 --> 00:07:34.382]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:07:34.802 --> 00:07:38.623]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:07:38.623 --> 00:07:39.864]  How much will you need?
[00:07:39.864 --> 00:07:40.764]  We don't know.
[00:07:40.764 --> 00:07:41.864]  How much do you want?
[00:07:41.864 --> 00:07:42.805]  All you can get.
[00:07:42.805 --> 00:07:43.885]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:07:43.885 --> 00:07:46.946]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:07:46.946 --> 00:07:48.727]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[00:07:48.727 --> 00:07:49.627]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[00:08:00.535 --> 00:08:05.939]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.939 --> 00:08:08.581]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:08.581 --> 00:08:24.033]  Well, here's the type of news headlines I have in front of me.
[00:08:24.033 --> 00:08:30.018]  Mule tax could be replaced with by-the-mile road tax.
[00:08:31.940 --> 00:08:54.344]  For more than 12 years, I have seen mainstream news articles, government documents, Texas Department of Transportation, Federal Department of Transportation, stating openly that by the year 2011, they plan to have giant pilot programs in every U.S.
[00:08:54.344 --> 00:09:00.825]  state, with satellite tracker boxes in the car taxing you by the mile on top of your gas tax.
[00:09:02.259 --> 00:09:07.226]  And I began about eight, nine years ago seeing articles where they said it would also track your carbon tax.
[00:09:07.226 --> 00:09:11.873]  So depending on the type of car you had, you would pay a higher rate.
[00:09:11.873 --> 00:09:16.840]  All about setting the precedent that they can control all behavior in engineer society.
[00:09:17.816 --> 00:09:23.661]  And I just have the McClatchy Newspaper article here as they're preparing the public more for that.
[00:09:23.661 --> 00:09:29.627]  Remember, Obama's Transportation Secretary two months ago said, yes, the feds are looking.
[00:09:29.627 --> 00:09:33.771]  We want to put satellite tracker boxes in your cars and tax you by the mile.
[00:09:33.771 --> 00:09:35.032]  And then they even proposed it.
[00:09:35.032 --> 00:09:37.354]  And then Obama came out and said, no, we're not doing that right now.
[00:09:37.354 --> 00:09:39.996]  But then they went ahead and started rolling it out.
[00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:42.098]  They even have a federal program here in Austin.
[00:09:42.915 --> 00:09:49.618]  Where they pay people to put the satellite tracker box in their car.
[00:09:49.618 --> 00:09:54.000]  To test the taxation of the slaves.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:03.864]  Toyota, GM and others have announced going back, oh I remember seeing it six, seven years ago, saying all cars will have cameras in them that watch you.
[00:10:03.864 --> 00:10:11.688]  And that are dialed in, I remember an MSNBC article, to a cell phone, just like OnStar, that digitizes the video signal
[00:10:13.716 --> 00:10:19.259]  And feeds it to local threat fusion FEMA command centers.
[00:10:19.259 --> 00:10:23.762]  And it said that it'll be in case somebody is acting up or in a police chase.
[00:10:23.762 --> 00:10:26.423]  The police can watch you inside the car.
[00:10:26.423 --> 00:10:27.604]  There will be kill switches.
[00:10:27.604 --> 00:10:30.585]  This is already happening with a lot of used cars that are being sold.
[00:10:30.585 --> 00:10:33.967]  Kill switches built in to the ignition.
[00:10:33.967 --> 00:10:37.729]  So the police will have a signal they beam to turn your car off.
[00:10:37.729 --> 00:10:39.871]  They also are selling the program.
[00:10:39.871 --> 00:10:41.191]  And again, all cars will have this.
[00:10:41.191 --> 00:10:41.932]  This has been announced.
[00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:50.243]  What they said by 2011, again on that subject as well, that's kind of the jump date for that.
[00:10:50.243 --> 00:10:56.145]  But they're selling it to people, oh, will 30 plus children die a year being left in a hot car?
[00:10:56.145 --> 00:10:59.987]  And these parents are complete morons, but everybody shouldn't be under Big Brother surveillance because of it.
[00:11:01.388 --> 00:11:05.730]  I didn't know if I left my kid in the car in 105 degree heat for an hour, they'd die.
[00:11:05.730 --> 00:11:09.512]  Some idiot woman just did that in Austin last week, but thank God her baby didn't die.
[00:11:09.512 --> 00:11:16.174]  Left it in 100 plus degree heat, meaning it was 130 in the car, for 45 minutes while she went shopping.
[00:11:16.174 --> 00:11:18.916]  Just a complete idiot.
[00:11:18.916 --> 00:11:22.177]  But that's what the cultures turn people into.
[00:11:22.177 --> 00:11:23.578]  Side issue.
[00:11:23.578 --> 00:11:24.338]  The point is,
[00:11:25.999 --> 00:11:44.745]  That they say that though the camera will have sensors, movement sensors in the car, and if it senses movement after the car goes up above 95 degrees, it will then dial the police and then they'll be able to watch you in the car.
[00:11:44.745 --> 00:11:50.567]  I'll never forget the governor of Wisconsin was in the news, it's in my film Matrix of Evil, Cicero 2004, and in that film,
[00:11:56.089 --> 00:12:11.732]  We have the mainstream news article, if you want to source it and find it, I forget the exact headline, where it was the Feds had put in a threat fusion center in Green Bay, and talked about how it was also in Milwaukee.
[00:12:11.732 --> 00:12:24.155]  And the governor was giving a tour to the news reporters saying, oh look at this federal center, if we want to know where somebody is, we just punch in their driver's license number, it goes into a federal database of cell phone numbers, that's under the Telecommunications Act of 96, that
[00:12:25.799 --> 00:12:27.920]  Became law.
[00:12:27.920 --> 00:12:32.442]  Compliance had to be set up by October 1st, 2001.
[00:12:32.442 --> 00:12:33.823]  But passed in 96.
[00:12:33.823 --> 00:12:39.146]  Perfect for after the fair mongering of 9-11, but set up actually five years before.
[00:12:39.146 --> 00:12:39.806]  Six years before.
[00:12:39.806 --> 00:12:42.807]  But it had to go into enactment.
[00:12:42.807 --> 00:12:44.969]  That all cell phones are tracked in real time.
[00:12:44.969 --> 00:12:48.730]  The police can dial in and listen to your audio, even if it's turned off.
[00:12:48.730 --> 00:12:49.491]  The feds can.
[00:12:49.491 --> 00:12:53.513]  They can also track you down to just a few feet off of GPS triangulation.
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:13:02.352]  And even if the phone's not GPS, it's that it's triangulated by GPS markers on the cell towers down to just a few feet.
[00:13:02.352 --> 00:13:09.384]  And so there was the governor punching it up and showing everybody citizens in live time driving around in the city of Green Bay.
[00:13:10.905 --> 00:13:12.827]  And bragging about the federal grant.
[00:13:12.827 --> 00:13:15.129]  Now, since then, most U.S.
[00:13:15.129 --> 00:13:24.737]  cities and threat fusion centers that local police are in being federalized, it's federally paid for, federally run, they don't tell local cops until they bring them in and say, oh, there's a new upgrade.
[00:13:24.737 --> 00:13:27.960]  We have face scanning cameras in Tampa and Dallas, Texas.
[00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:31.963]  We're reading everybody's license plates now that come through the town.
[00:13:31.963 --> 00:13:35.246]  They first introduce it to, oh, we're looking for stolen cars.
[00:13:38.393 --> 00:13:40.254]  And so that's how it's sold to the public.
[00:13:40.254 --> 00:13:50.601]  But I would tell people about this ten years ago when I was reading DARPA funding for, you know, every car that drives across the state line of Texas, or Indiana at the time, as two tested states.
[00:13:50.601 --> 00:13:51.862]  That was actually in 98.
[00:13:51.862 --> 00:13:53.182]  My goodness, time is just flying.
[00:13:53.182 --> 00:13:55.844]  So 11 years ago.
[00:13:55.844 --> 00:14:02.208]  And they would read the license plate of every car entering Texas and Indiana.
[00:14:02.208 --> 00:14:03.469]  Well, now it's nationwide.
[00:14:04.704 --> 00:14:18.250]  That's why there's federal laws and federal grants that the states have to upgrade and have high-def cameras now, and they've converted almost the entire camera system to the high-def, which then feeds into the AI computers.
[00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:28.475]  The technology I saw them reporting on five years ago said these cameras can read hundreds of license plates simultaneously per second.
[00:14:33.427 --> 00:14:35.268]  Per second!
[00:14:35.268 --> 00:14:37.870]  And people would laugh and joke and say it didn't exist.
[00:14:37.870 --> 00:14:39.692]  You know, local news would make fun of me.
[00:14:39.692 --> 00:14:43.274]  Alex says the cameras are reading our license plates.
[00:14:43.274 --> 00:14:44.976]  Ah-ha-ha!
[00:14:44.976 --> 00:14:49.039]  Alex says that they're listening to us with the OnStar and our cell phones.
[00:14:49.039 --> 00:14:50.460]  Ah-ha-ha!
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:55.784]  It's an absolute, on-record fact, Pentagon design, now announced to all the slaves.
[00:14:58.703 --> 00:15:01.604]  See, once they universally adopt it, they go ahead and tell you.
[00:15:01.604 --> 00:15:02.324]  Oh, guess what?
[00:15:02.324 --> 00:15:07.326]  Your driver's license is already federally standardized national ID.
[00:15:07.326 --> 00:15:09.687]  And it's been so since the early 90s.
[00:15:09.687 --> 00:15:10.847]  Oh, guess what?
[00:15:10.847 --> 00:15:14.768]  Since 2000, international treaties signed in Australia by the U.S.
[00:15:14.768 --> 00:15:16.389]  and 100 plus signatories.
[00:15:16.389 --> 00:15:19.130]  It's a world ID standardized system.
[00:15:19.130 --> 00:15:19.290]  Oh!
[00:15:25.134 --> 00:15:31.637]  I mean, all I'm doing is reporting fact on record.
[00:15:31.637 --> 00:15:34.338]  And this hurts each and every one of us.
[00:15:34.338 --> 00:15:36.399]  Look, I've made a lot of mistakes.
[00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:37.199]  Lord knows I have.
[00:15:37.199 --> 00:15:37.800]  I'm not perfect.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:38.900]  None of us are.
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.121]  I do the best I can.
[00:15:40.121 --> 00:15:41.241]  I swing as hard as I can.
[00:15:41.241 --> 00:15:45.003]  I step up to the plate and I go 110%.
[00:15:45.003 --> 00:15:47.624]  Sometimes I probably overheat, drive the engine too hard.
[00:15:50.461 --> 00:15:56.285]  I've done the equivalent many times on this racetrack of life of blowing engines, spinning out, smashing into the wall.
[00:15:56.285 --> 00:16:02.429]  But I get back in the car every single day, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:16:02.429 --> 00:16:05.211]  A lot of times it's quantity over quality.
[00:16:05.211 --> 00:16:11.716]  And I've made a lot of mistakes, and I think one of the biggest ones, and I do it every single week, I make the mistake I've gotten better, is going absolutely ape.
[00:16:13.041 --> 00:16:37.966]  Attacking the police, going wild, because at a primitive level, when I see him throwing people out of wheelchairs and beating them up, when I see him choking EMTs for no reason and then defending themselves, when I see him tasering old ladies and making excuses about it, when I see him shooting a guy in the back when he's in handcuffs and lying about it, at a primitive level, I become threatened by that, and I know tyranny comes to your door in a uniform.
[00:16:37.966 --> 00:16:39.107]  Historically.
[00:16:39.107 --> 00:16:40.807]  But liberty also comes in a uniform.
[00:16:41.940 --> 00:17:01.911]  And I know the average police and military are huge fans of the show, and I'm glad they're sophisticated enough and old enough and had more experience than me in many levels to forgive my stereotypes and how I get out of control.
[00:17:01.911 --> 00:17:07.474]  I'm always amazed by the tips and the information police give us that almost always pan out to be real and accurate.
[00:17:07.474 --> 00:17:09.735]  In fact, we've never been set up, actually.
[00:17:09.735 --> 00:17:10.216]  We've never been
[00:17:11.055 --> 00:17:15.556]  The info we get from police and highway patrol and military, I don't think it's ever turned out to be baloney.
[00:17:15.556 --> 00:17:18.257]  Because they're good at trying to give you good info.
[00:17:18.257 --> 00:17:22.819]  I've never really had a problem.
[00:17:22.819 --> 00:17:24.019]  And I've been let off of tickets.
[00:17:24.019 --> 00:17:25.740]  I do have a heavy foot, folks.
[00:17:25.740 --> 00:17:32.602]  And I've been let off of tickets quite a bit all over the country by police that pull me over and are fans.
[00:17:32.602 --> 00:17:35.023]  A few times they've told me, I like your show, but I'm still giving you a ticket.
[00:17:35.745 --> 00:17:42.449]  I was driving out there halfway to Crawford, I forget the town, I got a ticket, and he said, I listen to the show all the time, but you're still getting a ticket for 20 miles over.
[00:17:42.449 --> 00:17:45.511]  I was like, real nice, you know this is a speed trap.
[00:17:45.511 --> 00:17:51.215]  There's a school down the road on this country highway, and I didn't notice the 40 mile an hour and a 60.
[00:17:51.215 --> 00:17:57.539]  But the point is, that when I come in here and rant and rave against police, it doesn't help.
[00:18:00.270 --> 00:18:18.837]  Because that only compacts them more into their culture, and the system puts them in positions, gives them orders that are unconstitutional, the media plays up the bad stuff cops do, and it wants the police to feel like everybody hates them, so they'll start hating the public, and then the public will hate them more.
[00:18:18.837 --> 00:18:20.637]  It's a psy-op!
[00:18:20.637 --> 00:18:26.119]  And that's one of the biggest mistakes I've fallen into, is playing along with that.
[00:18:26.119 --> 00:18:27.180]  Lord knows I make mistakes.
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:35.142]  Kind of like I would revel bashing Bill Clinton, or revel bashing Barack Obama, instead of just pointing out, or George Bush, that they're just complete puppets.
[00:18:35.142 --> 00:18:58.130]  You know, I revel in calling him the pimp game liar, and talk about what a liar he is, but I needed to add in that point I made a few days ago that's gone viral on the web, that yeah, he's lying about signing statements and middle class tax increases, and Stephanopoulos on his national TV shows having fun pointing out Barack Obama's a liar, when Stephanopoulos is a Clinton operative.
[00:18:59.884 --> 00:19:01.265]  A Clinton strategist?
[00:19:01.265 --> 00:19:02.085]  Why?
[00:19:02.085 --> 00:19:05.446]  Because it's about tearing down Barack Obama.
[00:19:05.446 --> 00:19:11.489]  It's about making it him who's the liar so they can get you ready for the next savior.
[00:19:11.489 --> 00:19:14.610]  It's about making you think you can't ever have a real leader.
[00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:17.231]  It's about making you give up hope.
[00:19:17.231 --> 00:19:25.934]  Sure, Obama's bad and a liar and a slimeball, but I'm not going to get sucked into the hatred of Barack Obama as if he's actually the guy doing all this.
[00:19:25.934 --> 00:19:27.655]  He's just a petty, punk,
[00:19:28.959 --> 00:19:30.039]  Talker.
[00:19:30.039 --> 00:19:32.560]  Slick talker hired by these people.
[00:19:32.560 --> 00:19:34.200]  So I want to point that out later.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:40.002]  We've just got to get more sophisticated and not get played into their games, folks.
[00:19:40.002 --> 00:19:42.423]  And again, I want to thank the police.
[00:19:42.423 --> 00:19:45.123]  Again, who've warned us about operations being run against us.
[00:19:45.123 --> 00:19:49.765]  And I'll tell you about that coming up at the bottom of the hour.
[00:19:49.765 --> 00:19:54.626]  I want to thank God for moving them to warn us.
[00:19:54.626 --> 00:19:56.346]  Cover a lot more news.
[00:19:56.346 --> 00:19:58.227]  Sterilization of Africans when we get back.
[00:20:01.212 --> 00:20:06.737]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political problems facing the U.S.
[00:20:06.737 --> 00:20:07.538]  and the world.
[00:20:07.538 --> 00:20:11.401]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[00:20:11.401 --> 00:20:17.906]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated foods for almost 40 years.
[00:20:17.906 --> 00:20:19.928]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer.
[00:20:19.928 --> 00:20:27.875]  Unlike other companies that just broker canned foods, Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with double enameled cans and nitrogen packaging.
[00:20:28.135 --> 00:20:32.843]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale prices.
[00:20:32.843 --> 00:20:38.672]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve ships within five business days.
[00:20:38.672 --> 00:20:40.855]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog.
[00:20:40.855 --> 00:20:43.099]  We will be more than happy to send a catalog to you.
[00:20:43.419 --> 00:20:44.520]  Free of charge.

[00:20:46.222 --> 00:20:48.624]  Factory direct, wholesale pricing from Ready Reserve Foods.

[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:06.806]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[00:21:06.806 --> 00:21:12.692]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:21:12.692 --> 00:21:18.839]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[00:21:19.159 --> 00:21:21.140]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.601]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[00:21:23.601 --> 00:21:36.787]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[00:21:36.787 --> 00:21:38.468]  It's not about left or right.
[00:21:38.468 --> 00:21:40.329]  It's about a one-world government.
[00:21:40.329 --> 00:21:46.552]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[00:21:47.228 --> 00:21:55.499]  Get your copy of the Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:21:55.499 --> 00:21:57.061]  The Obama Deception.
[00:21:57.061 --> 00:21:58.263]  The people strike back!
[00:22:00.026 --> 00:22:06.692]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[00:22:06.692 --> 00:22:14.818]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[00:22:14.818 --> 00:22:20.403]  Is this a flaw-free enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt?
[00:22:20.723 --> 00:22:22.986]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[00:22:22.986 --> 00:22:28.072]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[00:22:28.072 --> 00:22:33.298]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[00:22:33.298 --> 00:22:37.022]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[00:22:37.623 --> 00:22:38.724]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:38.724 --> 00:22:43.229]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[00:22:43.229 --> 00:22:48.135]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[00:22:48.135 --> 00:22:51.138]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[00:22:51.138 --> 00:22:52.900]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:53.140]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[00:22:59.307 --> 00:23:02.710]  Would you give someone $100 for a $10 bill?
[00:23:02.710 --> 00:23:07.153]  If you're taking vitamins and minerals in a pill form, that's exactly what you're doing.
[00:23:07.153 --> 00:23:09.655]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[00:23:09.655 --> 00:23:14.779]  According to the physician's desk reference, many vitamins and minerals in a pill form are 10% absorbed.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:23.503]  It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out for every $100 you spend on these pills, you're flushing $90 down the toilet.
[00:23:23.503 --> 00:23:25.764]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.
[00:23:25.764 --> 00:23:32.867]  Introducing Chews for Health, a delicious tasting chewable containing 16 superfruits, seed vegetables, and antioxidants.
[00:23:33.107 --> 00:23:35.288]  You know, you work hard for your money.

[00:23:52.295 --> 00:23:53.195]  Or go to orderchoose.com.
[00:24:12.165 --> 00:24:15.366]  Are we gonna do what they say can't be done?
[00:24:15.366 --> 00:24:20.308]  We've got a long way to go, and a short time to get there.
[00:24:20.308 --> 00:24:22.389]  I'm eastbound just like no bandit run.
[00:24:22.389 --> 00:24:27.711]  Keep your foot hard on the pedal, son, never mind them brakes.
[00:24:27.711 --> 00:24:31.353]  Let it all hang out, cause we got a run to make.
[00:24:31.353 --> 00:24:35.054]  The boys up there stickin' that banter, and their spirit checks our canter.
[00:24:41.989 --> 00:24:43.951]  All right.
[00:24:43.951 --> 00:24:46.213]  Too bad he died this year.
[00:24:46.213 --> 00:24:49.835]  It was late last year.
[00:24:49.835 --> 00:24:59.183]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, bottom line, we are dealing
[00:25:06.795 --> 00:25:09.818]  With a complete and total New World Order takeover right now.
[00:25:09.818 --> 00:25:12.660]  They are moving on every front.
[00:25:12.660 --> 00:25:23.430]  This next three or four months in legislative session, when Obama's still got somewhat of a high approval rating, and he controls all three branches of government, we are in serious, serious trouble.
[00:25:23.430 --> 00:25:27.974]  And he's got the trifecta, as Bush would call it, the White House, the House, and the Senate,
[00:25:28.855 --> 00:25:31.198]  So he has complete control of the legislative.
[00:25:31.198 --> 00:25:41.271]  With the capitulation of Norm Coleman to Al Franken yesterday for the Senate, they supposedly got their filibuster-proof 60 votes in the Senate.
[00:25:41.271 --> 00:25:44.675]  You add to that, in case there's ever a tie, that the Vice President
[00:25:46.522 --> 00:25:52.568]  Mr. Gangster Biden is a Democrat, and this is what the Founding Fathers worried about.
[00:25:52.568 --> 00:25:58.513]  They said you shouldn't ever have both the House and Senate and the Presidency run by one party.
[00:25:58.513 --> 00:26:00.575]  They warned the public that that's dangerous.
[00:26:00.575 --> 00:26:06.981]  That's why we have separation of powers, so you can't get a Hitler or a Napoleon or a Lenin or a Fidel Castro.
[00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:10.371]  Or Hugo Chavez for that matter.
[00:26:10.371 --> 00:26:12.311]  Look at Chavez now.
[00:26:12.311 --> 00:26:13.932]  Unlimited state president.
[00:26:13.932 --> 00:26:14.492]  Unlimited.
[00:26:14.492 --> 00:26:17.273]  It's always the same.
[00:26:17.273 --> 00:26:20.814]  Power behaves this way.
[00:26:20.814 --> 00:26:23.155]  And we're seeing it happen right now.
[00:26:23.155 --> 00:26:24.895]  What's some of the other interesting news here?
[00:26:24.895 --> 00:26:26.336]  We'll cover this later.
[00:26:26.336 --> 00:26:29.897]  Toyota developing mind-controlled wheelchair.
[00:26:29.897 --> 00:26:32.177]  Very interesting article.
[00:26:32.177 --> 00:26:35.939]  On more serious issues, Rwanda denies sterilization plans.
[00:26:35.939 --> 00:26:36.059]  BBC.
[00:26:38.126 --> 00:26:52.049]  Funny, last week Rwanda was bragging how they were doing it, and it's hundreds of cases in Latin America, Asia, India, Vietnam, Brazil, Paraguay, I mean all over the UN goes in and sterilizes people.
[00:26:52.049 --> 00:26:53.969]  It's on record, it's official policy.
[00:26:53.969 --> 00:26:57.470]  But see, when it gets attention, oh, well we're not doing that.
[00:26:57.470 --> 00:27:04.291]  Rwanda has strongly denied reports that its parliament is considering a draft law which would forcibly sterilize people who are mentally disabled.
[00:27:05.489 --> 00:27:11.571]  The Deputy Speaker of the Parliament was responding to a call by U.S.-based activist Human Rights Watch to scrap the proposed law.
[00:27:11.571 --> 00:27:16.673]  He told the BBC that plans for HIV testing before couples get married are strictly voluntary, not compulsory.
[00:27:16.673 --> 00:27:23.175]  Of course, there where they get you in vaccines, you got 40% of the public who got HIV.
[00:27:23.175 --> 00:27:29.757]  And they've gone and done medical tests, and most of them haven't even had sex or ever used a needle, other than getting their vaccination.
[00:27:33.430 --> 00:27:38.492]  He said he'd never seen a bill of provision which proposed forcible sterilization.
[00:27:38.492 --> 00:27:41.633]  Then they go on to admit that there had been bills calling for that.
[00:27:41.633 --> 00:27:42.274]  There's another one.
[00:27:42.274 --> 00:27:45.415]  African women with HIV coerced into sterilization.
[00:27:45.415 --> 00:27:48.236]  And then they say, well, they've got HIV, so we need to sterilize them.
[00:27:49.164 --> 00:27:54.267]  Even though a baby only gets HIV about 10% of the time if the mother has it.
[00:27:54.267 --> 00:27:59.049]  And HIV is just a cover virus name for a whole bunch of soft kill operations going on.
[00:27:59.049 --> 00:28:11.596]  Well, I mean, it's on record that when George Bush headed things up for Nixon, they sterilized 40 plus percent of Native American women on reservations.
[00:28:11.596 --> 00:28:13.077]  I mean, that's in Canadian papers.
[00:28:13.077 --> 00:28:16.099]  They're doing it up there right now.
[00:28:16.099 --> 00:28:18.400]  Okay, here's the really big news.
[00:28:20.034 --> 00:28:26.618]  I have a tendency to get on air and not even get to the big news.
[00:28:26.618 --> 00:28:27.979]  This is coming up.
[00:28:27.979 --> 00:28:33.063]  Federal agents hunt for guns one house at a time.
[00:28:33.063 --> 00:28:37.425]  This is out of the Houston Chronicle.
[00:28:37.425 --> 00:28:41.228]  It's up on InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:28:41.228 --> 00:28:42.589]  We have links to that.
[00:28:42.589 --> 00:28:46.231]  They're going house to house looking for your guns.
[00:28:46.231 --> 00:28:48.233]  And the disgraced Blagojevich, remember?
[00:28:51.522 --> 00:29:11.722]  He announced, what was it, six months ago, before that whole scandal started, we played the press conference here, he said, yeah, we're going to use the National Guard, door-to-door, going into people's houses searching for guns, in Texas, in Wisconsin, in Nevada, in Arizona, in California, in New York, in Massachusetts.
[00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.190]  In fact, print me a few for folks.
[00:29:14.190 --> 00:29:16.131]  I don't want to just say there's articles.
[00:29:16.131 --> 00:29:20.492]  Print me knock-and-talk or police-ass residents about guns door-to-door.
[00:29:20.492 --> 00:29:22.132]  Knock-and-talk.
[00:29:22.132 --> 00:29:26.513]  All over the nation, federal grants, they come and say, why don't we come in and look at your guns, see if they're legal.
[00:29:26.513 --> 00:29:28.473]  They do this in Dallas.
[00:29:28.473 --> 00:29:29.654]  So they're coming for your guns.
[00:29:29.654 --> 00:29:30.734]  It's already begun.
[00:29:30.734 --> 00:29:32.414]  They put it on the news to acclimate you.
[00:29:32.414 --> 00:29:35.935]  Oh, police are coming door-to-door asking about your guns.
[00:29:35.935 --> 00:29:37.875]  Please answer the questions.
[00:29:37.875 --> 00:29:39.016]  Doesn't matter if the guns are legal.
[00:29:39.016 --> 00:29:40.036]  We need to go ahead and take those.
[00:29:43.189 --> 00:29:50.842]  And a lot more coming up, like foreign troops training in the U.S.
[00:29:50.842 --> 00:29:52.244]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.244 --> 00:29:54.768]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.768 --> 00:29:57.452]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.134 --> 00:30:05.978]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[00:30:05.978 --> 00:30:07.279]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[00:30:07.279 --> 00:30:11.562]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[00:30:11.562 --> 00:30:13.423]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[00:30:13.423 --> 00:30:19.727]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[00:30:20.868 --> 00:30:23.729]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[00:30:23.729 --> 00:30:25.470]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:28.470]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[00:30:28.470 --> 00:30:30.191]  And their formula really works.
[00:30:30.191 --> 00:30:33.012]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[00:30:33.012 --> 00:30:34.492]  Try the NutriCafe.
[00:30:34.492 --> 00:30:39.254]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[00:30:39.254 --> 00:30:41.675]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[00:30:41.675 --> 00:30:44.136]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[00:30:44.136 --> 00:30:46.236]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[00:30:46.236 --> 00:30:47.357]  Go to www.
[00:30:49.117 --> 00:30:52.018]  It is a big idea.
[00:30:52.018 --> 00:30:56.959]  A new world order.
[00:30:56.959 --> 00:31:07.241]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[00:31:07.241 --> 00:31:13.123]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[00:31:13.123 --> 00:31:15.923]  Could their objective be world domination?
[00:31:15.923 --> 00:31:18.324]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[00:31:19.099 --> 00:31:26.436]  Now as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[00:31:29.451 --> 00:31:34.895]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[00:31:34.895 --> 00:31:38.757]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[00:31:38.757 --> 00:31:41.339]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[00:31:41.339 --> 00:31:42.500]  Most people have no idea.
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:43.280]  They're not after money.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:44.561]  They have all the money they need.
[00:31:44.561 --> 00:31:45.542]  They're after power.
[00:31:45.542 --> 00:31:46.683]  That's what they're after.
[00:31:46.683 --> 00:31:51.446]  Order Endgame on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com.

[00:31:56.189 --> 00:31:58.210]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[00:31:58.210 --> 00:31:59.331]  You have been warned.
[00:31:59.411 --> 00:32:00.191]  Yeah.
[00:32:00.191 --> 00:32:03.573]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:32:03.573 --> 00:32:07.474]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:32:07.474 --> 00:32:11.195]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:32:11.195 --> 00:32:17.678]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine
[00:32:19.929 --> 00:32:20.389]  I think so.

[00:33:07.048 --> 00:33:31.782]  Well, I'm not the kind to kiss and tell But I've been seen with Farrah I've never been with anything less than a dime So fine I've been on fire with Sally Field Gone fast with a girl named Bo But somehow they just don't end up as mine It's a death-defying life I lead
[00:33:32.566 --> 00:33:34.608]  I'd take my chances.
[00:33:34.608 --> 00:33:39.971]  I'd die for a living in the movies and TV.
[00:33:39.971 --> 00:33:50.799]  But the hardest thing I ever do is watch my leading ladies kiss some other guy while I'm bandaging my knee.
[00:33:50.799 --> 00:33:53.561]  I might fall from a tall building.
[00:33:53.561 --> 00:33:55.683]  I might board a brand new car.
[00:33:58.224 --> 00:34:03.227]  All right, Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[00:34:03.227 --> 00:34:03.847]  to 3 p.m.
[00:34:03.847 --> 00:34:04.788]  Central Standard Time.
[00:34:04.788 --> 00:34:11.772]  We're here live, retransmitted and streamed at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:34:11.772 --> 00:34:19.676]  Going out worldwide, simulcast on the global shortwave, WWCR, great folks over there, and again back Sundays 4 to 6 p.m.
[00:34:19.676 --> 00:34:21.998]  Central Standard Time with abbreviated transmission.
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:36.988]  Okay, coming up, I want to go over the latest gun confiscation drills happening in D.C., in Boston, in Dallas, in Houston, in Phoenix, in Tucson, in Vermont.
[00:34:36.988 --> 00:34:39.649]  They're doing a lot of conservative pro-gun areas.
[00:34:39.649 --> 00:34:42.330]  They're coming to your door and saying, mind if we inspect your guns?
[00:34:42.330 --> 00:34:44.151]  And if you say no, they say, what do you have to hide?
[00:34:44.151 --> 00:34:50.315]  And again, police, I'm not here trying to attack you, but you're engaged in high treason when you do this, and I know you don't like doing it.
[00:34:51.667 --> 00:34:57.831]  Because I've seen the polls, when they've done national polls of police, it's 98% on average are against gun control.
[00:34:57.831 --> 00:34:59.512]  But, so what's your problem?
[00:34:59.512 --> 00:35:03.075]  Why are you doing something you know is anti-American?
[00:35:03.075 --> 00:35:08.098]  Tell the political criminals that run your department, no!
[00:35:08.098 --> 00:35:11.520]  Your little whorehouse unions are run by the New World Order as well.
[00:35:11.520 --> 00:35:12.901]  I'm sick of it!
[00:35:12.901 --> 00:35:14.842]  Stop it!
[00:35:14.842 --> 00:35:16.003]  This is the United States!
[00:35:16.003 --> 00:35:18.405]  It was all paid for in rivers of blood!
[00:35:19.554 --> 00:35:23.897]  And you disgrace that, and the cowardly public that doesn't stand up and speak out against this.
[00:35:23.897 --> 00:35:26.919]  You're the real people that are responsible for all this happening.
[00:35:26.919 --> 00:35:28.379]  Okay.
[00:35:28.379 --> 00:35:29.440]  I'm going to get to that also.
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:31.501]  Key story at Infowars.com.
[00:35:31.501 --> 00:35:37.165]  FEMA, Israeli Defense Forces, Home Front Command, partner for martial law.
[00:35:37.165 --> 00:35:41.868]  And I wanted to pull up National Exercise 2009, Ian and Ali, going on right now.
[00:35:44.588 --> 00:35:51.992]  Going on right now with troops from a whole bunch of foreign nations openly in where again?
[00:35:51.992 --> 00:35:58.035]  In Washington State, in Texas, in Michigan, in New York, and mainly in Arizona.
[00:35:58.035 --> 00:36:03.418]  They are doing foreign troop takeover drills in the U.S.
[00:36:03.418 --> 00:36:07.560]  For more than 11 years I videotaped these actions and put it out.
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:09.641]  Now it's mainstream news.
[00:36:09.641 --> 00:36:10.442]  More treason!
[00:36:13.832 --> 00:36:15.313]  So, that is coming up.
[00:36:15.313 --> 00:36:40.228]  I remember showing French, German, Dutch, British, Israeli, Australian troops at Urban Warfare 99 in Oakland practicing confiscating citizens' guns on video, and I would show you the foreign generals and the troops, and people would say, oh, that's not real video, or those aren't real hovercraft, and that's not the real Coronado Marine amphibious attack delivery system.
[00:36:40.228 --> 00:36:43.110]  It's like a pocket aircraft carrier.
[00:36:44.428 --> 00:36:46.110]  It's about half the size of a regular one.
[00:36:46.110 --> 00:36:48.032]  It's gigantic.
[00:36:48.032 --> 00:36:49.474]  It's a Marine main delivery ship.
[00:36:49.474 --> 00:36:58.604]  The point is, they said that was fake, and the hovercraft was fake, and the warrior fighting vehicles were fake, because they couldn't believe the gun confiscation drills were going on.
[00:36:58.604 --> 00:37:01.087]  The video.
[00:37:01.087 --> 00:37:03.230]  Colonel Love wasn't real, I interviewed.
[00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:04.271]  None of these people were real.
[00:37:06.121 --> 00:37:06.901]  No, it was real.
[00:37:06.901 --> 00:37:09.083]  The Marine Corps admitted they were doing it.
[00:37:09.083 --> 00:37:13.325]  But people had to be in denial watching foreign troops train to take your guns.
[00:37:13.325 --> 00:37:17.207]  Well, now here it is, open news.
[00:37:17.207 --> 00:37:18.488]  And who's one of the chief advisors?
[00:37:18.488 --> 00:37:23.091]  Israeli Defense Forces Home Front Command, partner for Marshall Law.
[00:37:23.091 --> 00:37:24.631]  Infowars.com.
[00:37:24.631 --> 00:37:30.415]  Believe it!
[00:37:30.415 --> 00:37:32.496]  Who do you think's training most of the local police departments?
[00:37:34.093 --> 00:37:36.795]  The IDF, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:36.795 --> 00:37:37.715]  You can Google that.
[00:37:37.715 --> 00:37:39.176]  Local police trained by IDF.
[00:37:39.176 --> 00:37:40.497]  In fact, print that for me.
[00:37:40.497 --> 00:37:44.660]  You guys did a great job printing all these gun confiscation articles I wanted to put with the Houston stories.
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:49.183]  People wouldn't think it was an isolated incident.
[00:37:49.183 --> 00:37:55.608]  Okay, bottom line, that's all coming up in an hour and one for two hours.
[00:37:55.608 --> 00:38:02.973]  I said that I wanted to talk about how we basically have bogeys on our six.
[00:38:05.163 --> 00:38:07.644]  On our tail.
[00:38:07.644 --> 00:38:15.846]  I have been on the receiving end of a lot of dirty tricks, a lot of COINTELPRO, and also just a lot of jealousy.
[00:38:15.846 --> 00:38:19.908]  Across the board.
[00:38:19.908 --> 00:38:26.330]  And I've kind of figured out a lot of cowards just are jealous of the fact that they don't have the courage I have.
[00:38:26.330 --> 00:38:29.911]  And aren't willing to get out there and bust their butts to really make change in the world.
[00:38:29.911 --> 00:38:33.312]  So, a lot of the attacks against me are just from the mentally ill public.
[00:38:34.454 --> 00:38:41.879]  And in a way, those actually advertise who I am, and people just come to check out what all the hubbub's about and find out the real me, not the distortions.
[00:38:41.879 --> 00:38:43.641]  So, in a way, that's a blessing.
[00:38:43.641 --> 00:38:49.185]  Every weapon formed against us ends up turning into a blessing.
[00:38:49.185 --> 00:38:52.007]  As long as that's in God's plan.
[00:38:52.007 --> 00:39:03.515]  And I don't ever pretend to pray and tell God what I want, or... I just know I'm in God's hands, and I've tried to be the best person I can, and I know which side I'm on, and I know who I belong to, and that's just the end of it.
[00:39:05.612 --> 00:39:13.374]  A lot of people fighting tyranny in the New World Order get messed with, get picked on, get fiddled with, and blow up and go into a million pieces.
[00:39:13.374 --> 00:39:13.754]  Not me.
[00:39:13.754 --> 00:39:18.095]  It always makes me work harder.
[00:39:18.095 --> 00:39:27.937]  And I don't try to get up here and advertise the things we've gone through, the incredible dirty tricks, just things that are really even hard to believe to me, and I've experienced it.
[00:39:32.378 --> 00:39:44.430]  And there is certainly, no doubt in my mind, we wouldn't be on air, I probably wouldn't even be alive or I'd be in prison set up if it wasn't for the fact that God's definitely got some angels protecting me.
[00:39:44.430 --> 00:39:47.593]  And because of your prayers out there.
[00:39:47.593 --> 00:39:54.220]  But I've always warned people when they come to work here, and I've always warned the public, that when you get involved in this, you need to know this is real.
[00:39:55.319 --> 00:39:56.720]  This isn't a game.
[00:39:56.720 --> 00:40:05.667]  We're going up against people who don't have any conscience, who are completely ruthless, and who actually enjoy hurting innocent people.
[00:40:05.667 --> 00:40:07.609]  And you need to be aware of that.
[00:40:07.609 --> 00:40:08.670]  They see life as cheap.
[00:40:08.670 --> 00:40:18.077]  In fact, they see life, human life, as actually dirt, as something bad, as something with negative value, not just cheap.
[00:40:18.077 --> 00:40:20.679]  But living, truly living, is all about
[00:40:21.596 --> 00:40:39.253]  Standing up for humanity, going through the fire, making it through on the other side, certainly with some scars, and developing as a human being and learning what life is really all about.
[00:40:39.253 --> 00:40:44.618]  Service, duty, being honorable, telling the truth, not sinking to other people's level,
[00:40:50.549 --> 00:40:57.574]  And so I'm not going to spend much more time talking about all the dirty tricks we go through and the things we face.
[00:40:57.574 --> 00:41:18.871]  Other than when we have the FBI show up, or we have the Secret Service show up, or I get army intelligence guys blocking me in a parking lot and threatening me, or my family gets death threats, or a helicopter over my house, or a helicopter over my mother's house at 50 feet flipping her off and laughing at her.
[00:41:21.741 --> 00:41:25.845]  Or, when my children get threatened, I just trust in God and move forward.
[00:41:25.845 --> 00:41:28.708]  There'll be a lot of other dirty tricks.
[00:41:28.708 --> 00:41:38.779]  But I'm not going to get specific about the new stuff that's going on, other than that it marks a new escalation in dirty tricks against me.
[00:41:43.975 --> 00:41:45.578]  And it's only going to give me energy.
[00:41:45.578 --> 00:41:55.934]  In fact, I've been really tired lately, working a lot of hours and a lot of interviews trying to finish a book and a film by September, early September.
[00:41:57.225 --> 00:42:00.267]  In fact, the deadline's actually late August.
[00:42:00.267 --> 00:42:15.837]  And actually, this persecution always makes me focus, gives me wells of strength, helps me have an attitude adjustment, helps me not be worldly, helps me not be controlled by the flesh, and just gives me incredible reserves and founts of will.
[00:42:21.195 --> 00:42:29.577]  And it also reaffirms just how important our work is and confirms just how evil this elite is and this system is.
[00:42:29.577 --> 00:42:36.038]  But I will say this, a lot of pieces of puzzles come together in research over the years.
[00:42:36.038 --> 00:42:50.681]  And you learn from congressional hearings, from the Church Committee on COINTELPRO and Black Ops Against Political Dissidence in the United States and worldwide, and army manuals on the subject, dealing with creating insurgencies or suppressing insurgencies,
[00:42:52.042 --> 00:42:55.725]  False flag, black ops, whisper campaigns, things of that nature.
[00:42:55.725 --> 00:43:00.168]  A lot of this is on record, the tricks they have.
[00:43:00.168 --> 00:43:03.751]  Infighting, things like that.
[00:43:03.751 --> 00:43:19.103]  But, I was told by federal and state sources I have to look out about seven months ago that they were going to try to tie me in with white supremacists who were going to commit violent acts.
[00:43:20.506 --> 00:43:25.888]  And these came from sources that have never been wrong in the past.
[00:43:25.888 --> 00:43:31.631]  And I've gotten other separate sources, which are then telling me the same things.
[00:43:31.631 --> 00:43:46.697]  And then you see Poplosky, within two hours of him killing those three cops, the Southern Poverty Law Center had contacted their operative, basically, a guy who writes about militias and white supremacists and anti-government groups.
[00:43:48.476 --> 00:44:02.231]  And had fed my name to him saying Poplosky was a fan and simultaneously one of his so-called friends was popping up on TV saying my name when it turned out Poplosky was actually attacking me all over my own site and other sites.
[00:44:02.231 --> 00:44:06.876]  And then he visited Fox News, CNN, it's now coming out in court and hundreds and hundreds of other sites.
[00:44:08.678 --> 00:44:16.821]  They chose me to go after within minutes it was being fed to the police, within two hours it was on the news.
[00:44:16.821 --> 00:44:19.402]  Who is the first person they think of?
[00:44:19.402 --> 00:44:20.802]  Me!
[00:44:20.802 --> 00:44:23.003]  Who is Soran thinking about?
[00:44:23.003 --> 00:44:26.244]  Me!
[00:44:26.244 --> 00:44:28.265]  Where is the eye on me?
[00:44:28.265 --> 00:44:30.926]  And believe me, I don't like it.
[00:44:30.926 --> 00:44:36.168]  At a certain level, I know, though it's my duty and it means I am hurting them.
[00:44:36.168 --> 00:44:36.928]  You are hurting them.
[00:44:39.130 --> 00:44:45.954]  And my only fear is, is if I get set up or I get destroyed, I don't want you to take that as a defeat.
[00:44:45.954 --> 00:44:50.576]  I want you to take that as a victory and realize how bad we're hurting them, and don't let that cow you.
[00:44:50.576 --> 00:44:57.480]  I want you to intensify everything you're doing, not redoubling, not 10%, not 100%, a thousand percent.
[00:44:57.480 --> 00:45:02.903]  Because they can't get all of us, they can't demonize all of us, they can't kill all of us, they can't shut us all down.
[00:45:04.324 --> 00:45:06.446]  If they shut me up, who will take my place?
[00:45:06.446 --> 00:45:07.267]  All of you.
[00:45:07.267 --> 00:45:14.675]  So don't get involved in the COINTELPRO, don't get involved in the petty flesh things they do, getting us all debating like we're all in a race car race with each other.
[00:45:14.675 --> 00:45:21.382]  We're in a race against the new world order together.
[00:45:21.382 --> 00:45:24.965]  And so all over the country with Von Brun, that's clearly a setup.
[00:45:25.782 --> 00:45:28.283]  He's been in federal custody for six years.
[00:45:28.283 --> 00:45:41.889]  It's now even come out in the National Press Club and in mainstream articles that Von Broom was tied into special forces and some weird white supremacist network in the military and police.
[00:45:41.889 --> 00:45:48.712]  The Southern Poverty Law Center, ADL, have been caught running white supremacist compounds over and over again, especially the Southern Poverty Law Center, Elohim City, Oklahoma City.
[00:45:49.633 --> 00:45:52.176]  It's come out in lawsuits.
[00:45:52.176 --> 00:45:58.522]  Here's the FBI, they've been forced and ordered in Salt Lake City to release documents proving that.
[00:45:58.522 --> 00:46:02.846]  Terry Nichols has signed affidavits that McVeigh was a government black op, high-level
[00:46:03.962 --> 00:46:06.504]  Above Top Secret, Infiltrator, and Provocateur.
[00:46:06.504 --> 00:46:08.045]  Look how they burned him.
[00:46:08.045 --> 00:46:14.490]  Just like they burned the torturers at some of the torture camps and used Patriot Act to shut them up and send them to prison.
[00:46:14.490 --> 00:46:25.838]  Even though the memos say they were ordered by Bush and Gonzalez to do it, when they started burning you as a patsy, you said, hey, I was ordered to, and released the document, and they sent your butt to prison for life using Patriot Act, didn't they?
[00:46:28.615 --> 00:46:38.384]  You better think about that, all of you, when they're trying to recruit all these CIA radio and TV ads, recruiting all these stupid college students as they triple their amount of domestic HUMET.
[00:46:38.384 --> 00:46:40.385]  I mean, they're spooking the entire country.
[00:46:40.385 --> 00:46:52.175]  They are turning us... Mainstream news has reported we have a higher ratio now of spooks than East Germany had at its height under Marcus Wolff, who they, by the way, hired as a consultant.
[00:46:53.607 --> 00:46:56.528]  In 2002, 2003, that's in the federal purchase orders.
[00:46:56.528 --> 00:46:58.068]  I didn't believe that when I saw it in the news.
[00:46:58.068 --> 00:47:01.549]  I went and looked up the congressional funding for it.
[00:47:01.549 --> 00:47:07.550]  Marcus Wolf set up what we're dealing with here.
[00:47:07.550 --> 00:47:10.391]  This isn't a game.
[00:47:10.391 --> 00:47:15.812]  And so, yes, the first name on their lips is me, Alex Jones.
[00:47:15.812 --> 00:47:17.353]  And that really made me have a gut check.
[00:47:17.353 --> 00:47:18.713]  And there's been a bunch of other stuff going on.
[00:47:21.733 --> 00:47:35.575]  Now we know what they're doing, as they're going out and contacting Patriot groups, 9-11 truth groups, student groups, with these quasi-militia truth groups, just like they did in the 90s, trying to demonize the Patriot movement.
[00:47:35.575 --> 00:47:39.396]  They infiltrated militias, tried to radicalize them, and they buried pipe bombs on their property.
[00:47:39.396 --> 00:47:43.417]  BATF was caught doing this, then taken to prison.
[00:47:43.417 --> 00:47:49.518]  What they're trying to do is have Patriot groups go out and then pose as me, use my name, do things like that,
[00:47:51.015 --> 00:47:59.913]  What they do is they bust somebody and then say, if you go out and affiliate yourself with Alex Jones and then say racist things and do this, this, and that, and do other even more horrid things...
[00:48:00.973 --> 00:48:07.498]  Then later, we're going to stage a bust, anybody you get into your group, and then we're going to try to tie that in with Alex Jones.
[00:48:07.498 --> 00:48:16.686]  And I've been told this now by two sources I know, and then other sources have been sending us documentation, and even links to government files.
[00:48:16.686 --> 00:48:27.975]  A lot of this comes out of the South, where the Southern Poverty Law Center is really in, they've got a lot of power, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina, and I've been sent
[00:48:32.512 --> 00:48:40.656]  Even back in the late 90s, I've been sent later declassified documents and documents released in court where my emails are being read.
[00:48:40.656 --> 00:48:46.518]  And so what we've done is we just put out the news, make the films, kind of isolate ourselves from everybody else.
[00:48:46.518 --> 00:48:54.802]  Because, I mean, I can be in an event, signing videos, and I'll have three undercover cops walk over and say, Alex, let's go kill cops, let's blow something up.
[00:48:54.802 --> 00:48:56.643]  And I just say, come on, man.
[00:48:56.643 --> 00:48:58.804]  And sometimes they'll even go, I'm just checking, come on, just doing my job.
[00:49:00.060 --> 00:49:02.602]  Because I'll follow a person out in the parking lot and go, what are you doing?
[00:49:02.602 --> 00:49:04.344]  You know I'm non-violent.
[00:49:04.344 --> 00:49:07.326]  I've had them come up and say, let's attack the State Department when I'm at Bilderberg.
[00:49:07.326 --> 00:49:10.529]  You know, just openly, and you go, come on, man.
[00:49:10.529 --> 00:49:11.290]  Just doing my job.
[00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:14.072]  I mean, they'll even come right out and admit they're cops.
[00:49:14.072 --> 00:49:15.934]  I'm sick of it!
[00:49:15.934 --> 00:49:20.037]  You are criminals when you try to do this to me, when you try to set me up.
[00:49:20.037 --> 00:49:20.658]  And know this.
[00:49:23.450 --> 00:49:31.865]  We have systems where no matter what happens to me, you legally are going to be brought to justice, and your name is going to be brought out, and all of you.
[00:49:31.865 --> 00:49:36.253]  You know, just run your black ops against me, but in the end, you're only going to make me stronger.
[00:49:38.737 --> 00:49:42.939]  And that's why I want to read the 23rd Psalm out there and ask everybody to pray for us in this ministry.
[00:49:42.939 --> 00:49:45.481]  The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not be in want.
[00:49:45.481 --> 00:49:47.722]  He maketh me to lie down in green pastures.
[00:49:47.722 --> 00:49:49.984]  He leads me beside quiet waters.
[00:49:49.984 --> 00:49:51.464]  He restores my soul.
[00:49:51.464 --> 00:49:54.666]  He guides me in paths of righteousness for His namesake.
[00:49:54.666 --> 00:50:00.410]  Even though I walk to the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with me.
[00:50:00.410 --> 00:50:03.031]  Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[00:50:03.031 --> 00:50:07.834]  You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[00:50:10.339 --> 00:50:14.761]  You anoint my head with oil, my cup overfloweth.
[00:50:14.761 --> 00:50:22.324]  Surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life, and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[00:50:22.324 --> 00:50:25.185]  And that's the most important part there in the end.
[00:50:25.185 --> 00:50:32.928]  They can kill my body, they can kill my name, but God knows the truth about what's written on my heart.
[00:50:32.928 --> 00:50:38.130]  And I discovered the horrible things they're planning to try to put on me, but I happily take this burden
[00:50:40.032 --> 00:50:42.975]  And I cheerfully move forward.
[00:50:42.975 --> 00:50:46.399]  And I want you all to have that spirit of liberty in your hearts.
[00:50:46.399 --> 00:50:49.803]  And know that we will go through this dark storm.
[00:50:49.803 --> 00:50:54.007]  But as long as we put on the armor of righteousness, we will defeat the enemy.
[00:50:54.007 --> 00:50:57.271]  And remember, the enemy will always tell you you're not good and you're not righteous.
[00:50:57.271 --> 00:50:58.272]  He will attack your faith.
[00:51:00.686 --> 00:51:01.947]  Economy have you down?
[00:51:01.947 --> 00:51:03.628]  Scared you might lose your job?
[00:51:03.628 --> 00:51:05.709]  Worried how you will provide for your family?
[00:51:05.709 --> 00:51:07.831]  Do you worry where your money will come from?
[00:51:07.831 --> 00:51:11.153]  You know that the economy is getting worse, but there is hope.
[00:51:11.153 --> 00:51:15.676]  Robert Beadle's new book, Here's What You Do, tells you what to do and how to do it.
[00:51:15.676 --> 00:51:19.238]  Even a 10-year-old can figure it out after reading this 72-page book.
[00:51:19.238 --> 00:51:20.139]  And the best part?
[00:51:20.139 --> 00:51:22.160]  This book is priced under $10.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:24.081]  Don't be the victim, be a victor!
[00:51:24.081 --> 00:51:26.182]  Go to hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:51:26.182 --> 00:51:28.064]  That's hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:51:28.064 --> 00:51:29.344]  Again, hereiswhatyoudo.net.
[00:51:30.285 --> 00:51:30.525]  I think so.
[00:52:00.645 --> 00:52:02.167]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[00:52:02.167 --> 00:52:07.532]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.

[00:52:19.102 --> 00:52:19.643]  I think so.

[00:54:14.178 --> 00:54:41.929]  Front porch sittin' In an old rockin' chair The sun is hot in the Texas sky Garden growin' Clothes out on a line A dusty road when a car goes by Story tellin' of days long ago
[00:54:44.654 --> 00:54:51.078]  There are no atheists in foxholes.
[00:54:51.078 --> 00:54:57.281]  And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[00:54:57.281 --> 00:54:58.101]  That's what matters.
[00:55:19.862 --> 00:55:30.210]  Alright, we're going to Ellen Watt on, right after I got a bunch of news to cover here.
[00:55:30.210 --> 00:55:31.711]  Massive gun grabbing going on.
[00:55:31.711 --> 00:55:33.813]  We'll cover some of that with Ellen Watt.
[00:55:33.813 --> 00:55:35.254]  But I wanted to get into this now.
[00:55:35.254 --> 00:55:36.855]  This story needs to go mega viral.
[00:55:36.855 --> 00:55:39.818]  I want to thank all of you that get the word out.
[00:55:41.018 --> 00:55:48.867]  You're really the reason we've had so much success at reaching the people and why the establishment is really going into high gear against me.
[00:55:48.867 --> 00:55:53.152]  Hit pieces just coming out everywhere in the mainstream news.
[00:55:53.152 --> 00:55:59.220]  FEMA, Israeli Defense Forces, home front partner for martial law.
[00:56:03.507 --> 00:56:19.411]  A press release, buried on the FEMA website, dated June 3rd, 2009, announces a meeting between FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate and Major General Yari Golan of the Israeli Defense Forces Home Front Command.
[00:56:19.411 --> 00:56:20.932]  We now have our own Home Front Command.
[00:56:20.932 --> 00:56:28.494]  I look forward to working with my Israeli counterpart as co-chair of an emergency management working group to improve emergency management practices in both countries.
[00:56:30.325 --> 00:56:42.537]  I mean, folks, regardless of what you think of Israel, either way, we shouldn't have a guy who's IDF and openly has dual loyalty, if even that, as chief of staff, who also says he wants to disarm all Americans.
[00:56:42.537 --> 00:56:51.885]  I mean, imagine if there was an American who was the deputy or the chief of staff of the Prime Minister of Israel saying, disarm the Israeli people.
[00:56:51.885 --> 00:56:53.127]  I mean, it's just outrageous!
[00:56:56.331 --> 00:57:05.440]  I look forward to working with my Israeli counterpart as co-chair of the Emergency Management Work Group to improve emergency management practices in both countries, said Fugate.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:13.327]  These partnerships are critical in ensuring we are incorporating the best practices and most workable towards greater public preparedness.
[00:57:13.327 --> 00:57:16.170]  The Israeli National Emergency Management Authority and FEMA
[00:57:17.219 --> 00:57:44.874]  Partnership will establish under an emergency management work stream work group establishment under 2007 memorandum of understanding with DHS according to press release FEMA representatives attended the national preparedness exercise turning point three in Israel on June 1st 2009 and Israel sent observers to the top off for national level exercise the United States as well as personnel to participate in FEMA's emergency management training.
[00:57:46.943 --> 00:57:53.207]  Top off, or top officials, is billed as a national premier terrorism preparedness exercise.
[00:57:53.207 --> 00:57:57.889]  Yeah, and in these top off exercises, they drill putting Americans in mass camps.
[00:57:57.889 --> 00:57:59.690]  That's been in even the Denver Post.
[00:57:59.690 --> 00:58:02.232]  So there's your FEMA camps right there.
[00:58:02.232 --> 00:58:13.038]  By Department of Homeland Security, thousands of federal, state, territorial, and local officials engaged in various activities as part of the robust, full-scale, simulated response to multifaceted threat.
[00:58:13.038 --> 00:58:16.040]  If you try to go videotape these reports, they arrest you, by the way.
[00:58:17.042 --> 00:58:18.343]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[00:59:20.489 --> 00:59:21.129]  We're good.
[00:59:53.203 --> 00:59:55.584]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:55.584 --> 01:00:05.048]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.048 --> 01:00:06.349]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.349 --> 01:00:08.110]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:09.871]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.871 --> 01:00:11.451]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.451 --> 01:00:13.032]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.032 --> 01:00:17.194]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.194 --> 01:00:19.535]  And now, live from Austin, Texas,
[01:00:20.442 --> 01:00:31.961]  Alex Jones.
[01:00:31.961 --> 01:00:34.525]  By the way, we got John Rhys-Davies.
[01:00:36.926 --> 01:00:37.987]  Coming on next Tuesday.
[01:00:37.987 --> 01:00:40.609]  I just want to tell you, my producer just confirmed that.
[01:00:40.609 --> 01:00:42.830]  He plays Gimli the Dwarf in Lord of the Rings.
[01:00:42.830 --> 01:00:45.552]  He's, uh, you know, in Raiders of the Lost Ark.
[01:00:45.552 --> 01:00:47.634]  Literally, hundreds of big films.
[01:00:47.634 --> 01:00:50.135]  He is a Patriot, we've learned.
[01:00:50.135 --> 01:00:51.436]  Anti-New World Order.
[01:00:51.436 --> 01:00:53.237]  Mm-mm.
[01:00:53.237 --> 01:00:57.701]  I really should announce big guests like that until they're actually on, but, uh, there you have it.
[01:00:57.701 --> 01:00:59.262]  That's set up.
[01:00:59.262 --> 01:01:02.184]  He'll be on next week.
[01:01:02.184 --> 01:01:04.765]  Look forward to that.
[01:01:04.765 --> 01:01:05.366]  Very interesting.
[01:01:08.869 --> 01:01:33.758]  I was just going over the fact that NATO countries, Israel, England, others, are training for the next month, it's been going on for a week and a half, with local police for massive coordinated terror attacks in the United States, which will be
[01:01:34.923 --> 01:01:36.324]  Of course, carried out by the New World Order.
[01:01:36.324 --> 01:01:37.765]  They've been caught over and over again.
[01:01:37.765 --> 01:01:39.386]  It's official government policy to stage terror.
[01:01:39.386 --> 01:01:42.249]  It's taught to Army Captains and above and Black Ops.
[01:01:42.249 --> 01:01:43.930]  Official 2004 training manual.
[01:01:43.930 --> 01:01:51.876]  I mean, how do these guys have training manuals teaching them how to stage terror attacks, but then they believe 9-11 wasn't staged?
[01:01:51.876 --> 01:01:54.458]  Hey, print me that article, You Don't Dare Scare a Police Officer.
[01:01:54.458 --> 01:01:57.060]  I forgot to print that one up on Infowars.com.
[01:01:57.060 --> 01:01:58.281]  So, National Level Exercise 2009.
[01:01:58.281 --> 01:02:01.603]  We've been talking about this for a month, but here it is.
[01:02:01.603 --> 01:02:03.645]  National Level Exercise is scheduled for
[01:02:05.902 --> 01:02:07.808]  July 27th through July 31st.
[01:02:07.808 --> 01:02:09.573]  Now that's only one of the national level exercises.
[01:02:09.573 --> 01:02:13.243]  They have another one that's kind of preparation for this that's been going on.
[01:02:14.324 --> 01:02:17.365]  In the build-up since the middle of June through July.
[01:02:17.365 --> 01:02:18.585]  There's a bunch of these.
[01:02:18.585 --> 01:02:28.167]  NLE-09 will be the first major exercise conducted by the United States government that will focus extensively on terrorism prevention, protection, as opposed to incident response and recovery.
[01:02:28.167 --> 01:02:29.348]  It's a giant intelligence op.
[01:02:29.348 --> 01:02:39.070]  The NLE-09 is designated as a Tier 1 level exercise, national level exercise, Tier 1 exclusively exercises, formerly known as the Top
[01:02:39.770 --> 01:02:57.124]  Officials Exercise Series, or TOPOF, are conducted annually in accordance with the National Exercise Program, NEP, which serves as the nation's overreaching exercise program for planning, organizing, conducting, and evaluating national-level exercises.
[01:02:57.124 --> 01:03:01.528]  A year before 9-11, they did drills of flying hijacked jets in the World Trade Center and Pentagon under one, I would add.
[01:03:02.677 --> 01:03:03.237]  They've got others.
[01:03:03.237 --> 01:03:09.020]  The Denver Post reported on what they did in Denver back in 2000, practicing rounding up the citizens, putting them in the sports stadium.
[01:03:09.020 --> 01:03:10.801]  You can go pull that up if you want.
[01:03:10.801 --> 01:03:12.901]  The NEP was established to provide the U.S.
[01:03:12.901 --> 01:03:18.604]  government at all levels exercise opportunities to prepare for catastrophic crises ranging from terrorism and natural disasters.
[01:03:18.604 --> 01:03:27.728]  What it is is a federalization test for testing control over local counties, cities, and states for martial law as put on paper in the John Warner Defense Authorization Act stating
[01:03:28.348 --> 01:03:33.179]  And now the DHS reports say it's for veterans, gun owners, and the states saying no to federalization.
[01:03:34.252 --> 01:03:41.516]  And using quote the army homeland security brigades against the American people and quote pulling triggers on American citizens.
[01:03:41.516 --> 01:03:53.963]  NLE09 is a White House directed, that's under National Security Council and General James Jones, congressionally mandated exercise that includes the participation of all appropriate federal department and senior agency officials.
[01:03:53.963 --> 01:03:56.424]  Now that's a lie from FEMA.
[01:03:56.424 --> 01:04:01.387]  Homeland Security Committee in the House is not allowed to see this under PDD 51, so another lie.
[01:04:02.307 --> 01:04:04.829]  It's not congressionally mandated at that level.
[01:04:04.829 --> 01:04:12.175]  Their deputies, staff, and key operations elements, in addition, broad regional participation of state, tribal, local, private sector is anticipated.
[01:04:12.175 --> 01:04:13.015]  Well, no, they tell them.
[01:04:13.015 --> 01:04:13.956]  We have the FEMA documents.
[01:04:13.956 --> 01:04:14.456]  It's law.
[01:04:14.456 --> 01:04:15.877]  They've got to follow their orders.
[01:04:15.877 --> 01:04:21.382]  This year, the United States welcomes the participation of Australia, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom in NLE09.
[01:04:21.382 --> 01:04:25.805]  When you actually read who's participating, it's... I always just throw out a dozen.
[01:04:25.805 --> 01:04:27.246]  It's 15 that I saw.
[01:04:27.246 --> 01:04:31.730]  And then now they're announcing others are helping run intelligence on American citizens.
[01:04:32.842 --> 01:04:34.203]  Exercise Focus.
[01:04:34.203 --> 01:04:36.583]  We'll get more to this with Alan Watt and a lot more coming up.
[01:04:36.583 --> 01:04:40.225]  And massive gun confiscation drills that are gone live.
[01:04:40.225 --> 01:04:49.268]  They're actually coming to people's doors, banging on the doors, and demanding to search them right now all over the United States.
[01:04:49.268 --> 01:04:58.392]  So these exercises are going live, and they've got foreign troops and intelligence officers helping in the Mobile Command Centers run these black ops against the U.S.
[01:04:58.392 --> 01:04:58.772]  slaves.
[01:05:00.253 --> 01:05:01.634]  This is Alex Jones.
[01:05:01.634 --> 01:05:03.616]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[01:05:03.616 --> 01:05:04.597]  Well, you should.
[01:05:04.597 --> 01:05:09.102]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[01:05:09.102 --> 01:05:09.903]  That's right.

[01:05:21.274 --> 01:05:27.258]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[01:05:27.258 --> 01:05:34.142]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[01:05:34.142 --> 01:05:39.666]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.

[01:06:06.998 --> 01:06:09.939]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[01:06:09.939 --> 01:06:12.999]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[01:06:12.999 --> 01:06:16.801]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[01:06:16.801 --> 01:06:17.701]  In any emergency,
[01:06:17.941 --> 01:06:19.062]  If you simply prepare.
[01:06:19.062 --> 01:06:22.305]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[01:06:22.305 --> 01:06:29.310]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.

[01:08:04.323 --> 01:08:09.787]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:09.787 --> 01:08:17.092]  Welcome, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:17.092 --> 01:08:17.532]  Welcome.
[01:08:17.532 --> 01:08:21.535]  We are now simulcasting the last two hours and 52 minutes.
[01:08:23.576 --> 01:08:28.701]  This syndicated radio show at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[01:08:28.701 --> 01:08:41.194]  And for the next two hours, we are joined by researcher Alan Watt, who really is an expert on the eugenics, the architecture of the global slave state, the system that we're under.
[01:08:41.194 --> 01:08:46.099]  And today, I want to get more into the architecture of the New World Order with Alan Watt.
[01:08:47.245 --> 01:08:56.308]  And how their control grid works, the different Hegelian dialectic factions they use to create the synthesis of control.
[01:08:56.308 --> 01:08:57.348]  They openly write about this.
[01:08:57.348 --> 01:08:58.149]  They're quite proud of it.
[01:08:58.149 --> 01:09:01.190]  They say there's no way the slaves will even read this and care.
[01:09:01.190 --> 01:09:02.210]  Too few of them will.
[01:09:02.210 --> 01:09:10.953]  You know, they claim they're all high and mighty and doing this for great scientific reasons to call the population to save the earth, but they're actually very sadistic and enjoy
[01:09:11.713 --> 01:09:19.619]  What they're doing from their own actions and their own statements and the very dark poetry they write about destroying the universe just for the willingness of it.
[01:09:19.619 --> 01:09:21.121]  Just for the nihilistic enjoyment.
[01:09:21.971 --> 01:09:22.231]  I don't know.
[01:09:44.181 --> 01:09:46.943]  They're launching the total global banking takeover publicly.
[01:09:46.943 --> 01:09:51.525]  They're launching the hate crimes banning free speech has passed the House about to pass the Senate.
[01:09:51.525 --> 01:09:58.909]  Total federalization of all water simultaneously in England, Australia, Canada, United States, Europe, Africa.
[01:09:58.909 --> 01:10:01.511]  Sterilizations openly being announced.
[01:10:01.511 --> 01:10:04.992]  They're moving forward with massive gun restrictions in the U.S.
[01:10:04.992 --> 01:10:08.835]  The same thing they've done in Europe and in England and in Canada.
[01:10:08.835 --> 01:10:10.015]  It's all happening.
[01:10:10.015 --> 01:10:10.676]  They are moving
[01:10:11.636 --> 01:10:14.417]  With the total blanket amnesty breaking down the borders.
[01:10:14.417 --> 01:10:19.719]  Openly saying they want to break down and blow out the economy so we're all bankrupt and can't pay their property taxes.
[01:10:19.719 --> 01:10:25.942]  So they force us into compact control grid cities, animal ID, premises ID, to shut down the farms and ranches.
[01:10:25.942 --> 01:10:30.664]  Where small farms, $20 per chicken to have an RFID tag.
[01:10:31.664 --> 01:10:39.113]  Tyson gets waivers and has one tag per thousand chickens, or one tag per building now of a half million chickens.
[01:10:39.113 --> 01:10:40.896]  I was corrected by some of the farm and ranch groups.
[01:10:40.896 --> 01:10:41.817]  They sent me the documents.
[01:10:41.817 --> 01:10:47.684]  It could be per entire complexes of 20, 30 buildings with 100,000 chickens per building.
[01:10:47.684 --> 01:10:48.285]  I actually have...
[01:10:49.346 --> 01:10:53.009]  A fellow who married one of my cousins, and so he lives out on the ranch in East Texas.
[01:10:53.009 --> 01:10:58.473]  He was telling me, because he goes and cleans out turkey and chicken coops industrially as his business, with these big trucks he owns.
[01:10:58.473 --> 01:11:01.876]  He said, no, no, no, it's a tag per complex now.
[01:11:01.876 --> 01:11:07.641]  But the citizens, $20 tag per chicken, and SWAT teams are hitting them and hitting them hard in the news.
[01:11:07.641 --> 01:11:10.263]  Don't sell those organic eggs on the highway.
[01:11:10.263 --> 01:11:11.444]  Don't sell those watermelons.
[01:11:11.444 --> 01:11:12.765]  You don't have a license.
[01:11:12.765 --> 01:11:16.828]  If you come back, they send in SWAT teams in the news.
[01:11:18.953 --> 01:11:26.642]  And they don't even come to, they send undercover police to buy the eggs or watermelons because they want to have it to be in the news to scare everybody.
[01:11:26.642 --> 01:11:32.410]  Then they raid the farmer's house on the news and put them in handcuffs and seize all their equipment.
[01:11:33.564 --> 01:11:35.665]  Folks, this is in the news every week now.
[01:11:35.665 --> 01:11:39.588]  So it's a total dehumanization, a total serfdom, a total culling.
[01:11:39.588 --> 01:11:43.830]  I want to try now to really let Alan Watt flow with this and break it down.
[01:11:43.830 --> 01:11:44.630]  Where should we start?
[01:11:44.630 --> 01:11:46.131]  At the end of what they're planning?
[01:11:46.131 --> 01:11:47.112]  Or at the beginning?
[01:11:47.112 --> 01:11:48.653]  Or their current operations?
[01:11:48.653 --> 01:11:50.534]  Or this driving us off the land?
[01:11:50.534 --> 01:11:53.816]  Or why are they moving on every front in hyperdrive?
[01:11:53.816 --> 01:12:00.440]  It looks to me like their system isn't in control, and they're kind of winning the race, but their Formula One car
[01:12:01.400 --> 01:12:24.049]  I think really they're going to plan because this is the century for change and what they're talking about of course is this totalitarian world regime and when you go as far back as the United Nations and then the League of Nations, the precursor,
[01:12:25.070 --> 01:12:28.072]  They set up a department for agriculture, for instance.
[01:12:28.072 --> 01:12:34.234]  In fact, they set up a department for everything that you need personally to live, to sustain your own life.
[01:12:34.234 --> 01:12:40.838]  Because the world is said to bring in, is one where the common people could not rule and guide your own lives.
[01:12:40.838 --> 01:12:42.598]  It would be done by experts.
[01:12:42.598 --> 01:12:49.782]  And all private property, eventually, and all foodstuffs and all water would be given over to these.
[01:12:50.666 --> 01:12:52.247]  We're good to go.
[01:13:15.123 --> 01:13:18.545]  They actually opened up the Department for Agriculture for the UN.
[01:13:18.545 --> 01:13:23.068]  They said that farming was too important to be left to farmers.
[01:13:23.068 --> 01:13:26.550]  In other words, it was to be left to the big agri-food businesses.
[01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:34.736]  And that's what we've been watching for years now, as the big agri-businesses take over and put the small guys under, with the help of government.
[01:13:34.736 --> 01:13:36.637]  Government's been taxing farmers
[01:13:37.250 --> 01:13:37.670]  I think so.
[01:14:06.189 --> 01:14:13.992]  And we're being trained and desensitized and trained and trained and trained to just accept and go along with everything that's given to us.
[01:14:13.992 --> 01:14:20.775]  And whenever a panel of experts speak on environment or whatever, we're supposed to just believe it like that, like it's the gospel truth.
[01:14:21.317 --> 01:14:22.878]  They are the new priesthood.
[01:14:22.878 --> 01:14:24.278]  This is the new religion.
[01:14:24.278 --> 01:14:39.223]  And we find that Gorbachev, in one of his own books, said, after saying that he was an atheist, he said, we are creating a new world religion, and it must be based on a form of earth worship that's called environmentalism.
[01:14:39.223 --> 01:14:48.506]  That's what they're using, along with the purse, the power of the purse and taxation and fining, reinforced by government laws.
[01:14:48.506 --> 01:14:49.746]  So it's working in all
[01:14:50.413 --> 01:14:55.385]  Tied so perfectly well together, meshed together, all at the same time, worldwide.
[01:14:55.385 --> 01:14:59.255]  Whatever happens in the US is happening in Australia at the same time, for instance.
[01:14:59.997 --> 01:15:01.217]  And this is not your opinion.
[01:15:01.217 --> 01:15:04.959]  It's all on record in thousands of public volumes.
[01:15:04.959 --> 01:15:13.722]  They've been building it for centuries off the British imperial model that took from the Roman and many others openly studied at the imperial academies, as you know.
[01:15:13.722 --> 01:15:16.003]  And they keep tweaking it and refining it.
[01:15:16.003 --> 01:15:18.464]  And people say, well, how can this go on for generations?
[01:15:18.464 --> 01:15:20.505]  Carol Quigley and many others explain that.
[01:15:20.505 --> 01:15:23.346]  How does a university go on for 500 years?
[01:15:23.346 --> 01:15:25.126]  How does a royal family go on for 500, 1,000 years?
[01:15:26.607 --> 01:15:36.430]  These are institutions that grow and expand and always fine-tune their science of propaganda, their science of feudalism, their science of serfdom.
[01:15:36.430 --> 01:15:51.595]  As you know, there are 2,000-year-old Julius Caesar manuals, 2,050-plus-year-old manuals on how to control populations that are very sophisticated, but nothing compared to the scientific sophistication now that we're facing.
[01:15:51.855 --> 01:16:00.481]  And what we're seeing, too, is the incredible cohesiveness between all of these big institutions and so-called non-governmental organizations.
[01:16:00.481 --> 01:16:02.743]  It's a flawless web.
[01:16:02.743 --> 01:16:06.025]  They're all on board together on the same topic.
[01:16:06.025 --> 01:16:12.109]  And when you join one of these groups, you have to accept all the other groups' mandates as well, regardless.
[01:16:12.109 --> 01:16:20.055]  Put your own personal thoughts to the side, and you must be politically correct on every single topic today.
[01:16:20.055 --> 01:16:21.496]  That's total political correctness.
[01:16:22.279 --> 01:16:30.605]  And so you must go along with the environment, global warming, how it must restrict all our movements, all our travel because of global warming, etc.
[01:16:30.605 --> 01:16:36.090]  regardless of the NGO that you sign on for initially.
[01:16:36.090 --> 01:16:37.030]  Continue.
[01:16:37.030 --> 01:16:40.093]  And what they call it too is consensus building.
[01:16:40.093 --> 01:16:49.760]  They even have think tanks that, if you're talking about institutions and how they can go on for centuries, quickly said that, he said, if they set up an institution with a mandate, they can hire
[01:16:50.447 --> 01:16:50.707]  I'm
[01:16:59.344 --> 01:17:06.968]  And they install profitability.
[01:17:06.968 --> 01:17:09.689]  They use environmentalism as a tax to fund themselves.
[01:17:09.689 --> 01:17:11.330]  It's really feudalism.
[01:17:11.330 --> 01:17:18.033]  And then as they expand it, they're getting rich and more powerful themselves through each phase, almost like a coral reef.
[01:17:18.033 --> 01:17:20.494]  It's incredible that there's a Google video up there.
[01:17:20.494 --> 01:17:26.057]  I have the link for it, where you'll hear Maurice Strong introduce Byron Rothschild
[01:17:26.818 --> 01:17:35.944]  And Baron Rothschild stands up at this World Climate Change Conference and so on, and says, we need another bank to deal.
[01:17:35.944 --> 01:17:39.167]  The public will have to fund by their tax money, by the way.
[01:17:39.167 --> 01:17:42.389]  But we need another bank to deal with environment.
[01:17:42.389 --> 01:17:45.731]  Well, of course, the bank's already been given a name.
[01:17:45.731 --> 01:17:47.593]  And guess who handles the money?
[01:17:47.593 --> 01:17:50.815]  It goes through Rothschild's private bank in Switzerland.
[01:17:50.815 --> 01:17:53.697]  About eight or nine of these United Nations
[01:17:58.404 --> 01:17:59.884]  Well, take Al Gore.
[01:17:59.884 --> 01:18:10.146]  First, he denied last year in Congress that he was getting money through Gore and Blood, no pun intended, one of the big climate fencing companies, and then that's got N.M.
[01:18:10.146 --> 01:18:11.867]  Rothschild funding in the news.
[01:18:11.867 --> 01:18:13.527]  First, he said it was all a lie.
[01:18:13.527 --> 01:18:14.867]  Two weeks ago, we have the video.
[01:18:14.867 --> 01:18:16.047]  He goes, so what?
[01:18:16.047 --> 01:18:17.948]  I'm allowed to make money doing good.
[01:18:17.948 --> 01:18:21.468]  So now he just admits that he's going to get the money.
[01:18:21.468 --> 01:18:24.049]  I mean, we're openly paying it to him.
[01:18:24.449 --> 01:18:25.970]  Yes, that's correct.
[01:18:25.970 --> 01:18:28.432]  This is a new feudal system.
[01:18:28.432 --> 01:18:29.572]  This is a feudal system.
[01:18:29.572 --> 01:18:37.717]  These are the new overlords who, with the collusion of governments, have given themselves the right to lord over the public.
[01:18:37.717 --> 01:18:44.842]  And as I say, they're taking over everything you need individually to survive and live on this planet.
[01:18:44.842 --> 01:18:50.045]  We'll have to go to them cap in hand for water, food, energy, everything we need
[01:18:50.638 --> 01:18:52.039]  It's a new form of slavery.
[01:19:21.098 --> 01:19:22.379]  Yes it is.
[01:19:22.379 --> 01:19:39.649]  And unfortunately, as we know, with this odd situation that people cannot figure out, where governments bow to these characters, these private NGOs and foundations, and do what they're told, that tells you there is a parallel government that exists above the ones that we think we elect.
[01:19:41.610 --> 01:19:42.831]  And they want you dead, folks.
[01:19:42.831 --> 01:19:45.492]  They don't even want to tax you and control you.
[01:19:45.492 --> 01:19:46.132]  They want you dead.
[01:19:46.132 --> 01:19:52.555]  It's the ultimate control freak, genocide, culling, wiping you out so they can inherit the New World Order promised land.
[01:19:52.555 --> 01:19:54.836]  Most of you listening, they are going to kill you.
[01:19:54.836 --> 01:19:55.456]  That's just a fact.
[01:20:00.489 --> 01:20:06.712]  How would you like to cook any meal using no electricity or gas and cook your meals off the grid?
[01:20:06.712 --> 01:20:09.334]  Well, now you can, thanks to the Survival Oven.
[01:20:09.334 --> 01:20:17.098]  The Survival Oven is the most amazing off-grid solar oven that can cook anything that a conventional oven can without the energy bills.
[01:20:17.098 --> 01:20:29.184]  By condensing sunlight, the Survival Oven can produce temps up to 350 degrees, cook delicious and nutritious meals, sterilize water, dehydrate food, and so much more, all at zero operating costs.
[01:20:29.404 --> 01:20:29.644]  I think so.
[01:20:47.649 --> 01:20:52.093]  And less than 10 pounds, you can take Survival Solar Oven with you anywhere.
[01:20:52.093 --> 01:20:57.998]  Call 877-642-1553 or go to survivaloven.com.
[01:20:57.998 --> 01:21:00.300]  That's survivaloven.com.
[01:21:00.300 --> 01:21:01.101]  Gold.
[01:21:01.101 --> 01:21:02.622]  It's like nothing else on Earth.
[01:21:02.622 --> 01:21:08.907]  From the Romans through the Renaissance, from the Industrial Age to the Space Age, gold has weathered the test of time.
[01:21:08.907 --> 01:21:13.071]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[01:21:13.071 --> 01:21:15.013]  According to the World Gold Council and the U.S.
[01:21:15.013 --> 01:21:15.193]  Mint,
[01:21:15.533 --> 01:21:17.414]  Demand is at an all-time high.
[01:21:17.414 --> 01:21:25.517]  The stage is being set for the re-emergence of gold as the common-sense alternative to a fiat paper currency that gets weaker every day.
[01:21:25.517 --> 01:21:34.580]  Midas Resources is proud to offer the hard-hitting report that arms you with the truth you need to protect you and your family from the Fed's plans for your hard-earned money.
[01:21:34.580 --> 01:21:35.880]  Don't gamble with your future.
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:40.082]  Call Midas Resources today and ask for your free copy of As Good As Gold.
[01:21:40.302 --> 01:21:46.247]  Call 1-800-686-2237 for the report the Fed hopes you'll never see.
[01:21:46.247 --> 01:21:51.071]  As good as gold can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[01:21:51.071 --> 01:21:55.335]  If you have ever thought about owning gold, you must read this report.
[01:21:55.335 --> 01:21:56.456]  Call Midas today at 800-686-2237.
[01:21:56.456 --> 01:21:56.976]  It is a big idea.
[01:21:56.976 --> 01:21:58.818]  A new world order in the near future.
[01:22:06.124 --> 01:22:09.187]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[01:22:09.187 --> 01:22:12.030]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[01:22:12.030 --> 01:22:14.813]  Could their objective be world domination?
[01:22:14.813 --> 01:22:17.996]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[01:22:17.996 --> 01:22:25.323]  Now, as they hail the birth of the New World Order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[01:22:28.345 --> 01:22:33.769]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[01:22:33.769 --> 01:22:37.651]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[01:22:37.651 --> 01:22:40.213]  Build a paradise and make great progress toward a world government.
[01:22:40.213 --> 01:22:41.394]  Most people have no idea.
[01:22:41.394 --> 01:22:42.174]  They're not after money.
[01:22:42.174 --> 01:22:43.455]  They have all the money they need.
[01:22:43.455 --> 01:22:44.436]  They're after power.
[01:22:44.436 --> 01:22:45.577]  That's their aphrodisiac.
[01:22:45.577 --> 01:22:54.302]  Order In Game on DVD at PrisonPlanet.com or InfoWars.com or watch it online right now at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:22:54.302 --> 01:22:57.104]  In Game, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:22:57.104 --> 01:22:58.185]  You have been warned.
[01:22:59.346 --> 01:23:06.471]  Finally in the news this evening, it's being reported that cyber spies from Russia and China have now penetrated our power grid.
[01:23:06.471 --> 01:23:22.703]  Even as energy experts are reporting that each summer we get closer and closer to the limits of our nation's power grid, some say that this summer's demand for electrical power may finally push the grid over its edge, creating a cascade of power outages across the country, putting us all in the dark.
[01:23:22.703 --> 01:23:27.827]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm-related outages or government-created blackouts?
[01:23:28.047 --> 01:23:34.575]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid and generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[01:23:34.575 --> 01:23:38.459]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard.
[01:23:38.459 --> 01:23:41.162]  Solar-powered generators are finally available.
[01:23:41.162 --> 01:23:46.529]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break and require absolutely no gas whatsoever.
[01:23:46.829 --> 01:23:49.511]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:23:49.511 --> 01:23:51.733]  So go to MySolarBackup.com.
[01:23:51.733 --> 01:23:54.236]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:23:54.236 --> 01:24:08.829]  Check out MySolarBackup.com before you lose your power.
[01:24:08.829 --> 01:24:09.750]  We've got that link.
[01:24:09.750 --> 01:24:10.891]  We're going to post it up on
[01:24:12.619 --> 01:24:15.480]  PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:20.143]  I'd actually played this about a year ago and I'd forgotten about it.
[01:24:20.143 --> 01:24:23.424]  I mean, there's so much evidence.
[01:24:23.424 --> 01:24:32.669]  It's daily where Maury Strong's saying, you know, all these horrible things about the New World Order and international bankers calling us cannon fodder, the population.
[01:24:32.669 --> 01:24:34.690]  Alan, tell folks some of the things that are in this video.
[01:24:34.690 --> 01:24:37.572]  You've also got it linked up on CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com.
[01:24:37.572 --> 01:24:39.973]  Tell folks what some of the things they say on this video.
[01:24:42.264 --> 01:24:49.509]  George Hunt has a business to do with environmental friendly products and so on.
[01:24:49.509 --> 01:24:54.653]  So he goes to these meetings for the environment where Maurice Strong goes and Rothschilds go.
[01:24:54.653 --> 01:25:01.878]  And you'll hear Maurice Strong on two occasions, two clips within that video, introduce Lord Rothschild.
[01:25:01.878 --> 01:25:10.565]  And Lord Rothschild comes on and basically advocates for another United Nations fund to be set up, another special bank.
[01:25:11.229 --> 01:25:15.570]  To deal with the environment, one in many that's already there.
[01:25:15.570 --> 01:25:30.375]  And Rothschild, of course, you find in the clip, this bank they want to set up, funded by our tax money as penalties against environment, will go through Rothschild's private bank, their family bank in Switzerland, so he'll be in charge of it.
[01:25:30.375 --> 01:25:33.836]  This multi, multi, multi trillionaire doesn't need money.
[01:25:34.383 --> 01:25:40.586]  But here he is handling everyone else's money in the forms of penalization against the environment.
[01:25:40.586 --> 01:25:43.868]  It's just astonishing.
[01:25:43.868 --> 01:25:47.409]  And tell folks some of the other things that Maury Strong says in here.
[01:25:47.409 --> 01:25:54.433]  Well, Maury Strong, of course, as we know, was picked up by Rockefeller himself, Ruben Trump, from a young boy.
[01:25:54.433 --> 01:25:58.415]  And he's been in, God knows, many top United Nations positions.
[01:25:59.271 --> 01:26:04.835]  Currently, he's set up by the United Nations to even further the integration of East and West in China.
[01:26:04.835 --> 01:26:08.417]  He lives in China at the moment, but still working for the UN.
[01:26:08.417 --> 01:26:14.561]  He's the one who set up the Biodiversity Treaty on behalf of Rockefeller.
[01:26:14.561 --> 01:26:17.323]  We're all under it now, this Biodiversity Treaty.
[01:26:17.323 --> 01:26:23.287]  We have no rights at all as humans, and every insect on the planet now is elevated much, much higher than we are.
[01:26:23.877 --> 01:26:31.784]  And as to do with natural resources, the sharing of natural resources cannot be left into the private hands.
[01:26:31.784 --> 01:26:35.387]  It must go into these elitist organizations.
[01:26:35.387 --> 01:26:39.892]  That was all done at the Rio, the first Rio conference they had.
[01:26:39.892 --> 01:26:47.839]  But Maurice Strong, when you go into his history, you'll find this in public broadcasting networks in the television sector.
[01:26:47.839 --> 01:26:49.180]  They did a documentary on him.
[01:26:49.833 --> 01:26:56.417]  And when he was in China, he went to a graveyard to put flowers at his aunt's grave.
[01:26:56.417 --> 01:26:59.999]  And she was the best advisor to Ma Zitong.
[01:26:59.999 --> 01:27:06.382]  These families are international, intergenerational revolutionaries for this new world order.
[01:27:06.382 --> 01:27:07.343]  It runs in their families.
[01:27:07.691 --> 01:27:15.414]  Well that's why in 76, the huge editorial written by David Rockefeller saying, Mao did a great job killing 60 plus million people.
[01:27:15.414 --> 01:27:17.734]  I mean, they're proud of their mass murder.
[01:27:17.734 --> 01:27:18.855]  Yes.
[01:27:18.855 --> 01:27:19.675]  Yes they are.
[01:27:19.675 --> 01:27:26.558]  And they also highly laud the population reduction for abortions, mandatory abortions in China.
[01:27:26.558 --> 01:27:35.080]  Remember, they have said personally, and the United Nations has also said, that China is the model state for the world to follow.
[01:27:35.080 --> 01:27:36.541]  We've all to follow their policies.
[01:27:40.478 --> 01:27:44.541]  Continue with what they plan to do to us on record.
[01:27:44.541 --> 01:27:46.163]  It's out in the open now.
[01:27:46.163 --> 01:27:50.606]  There's a whole bunch of British newspapers came out about a month ago.
[01:27:50.606 --> 01:28:06.319]  I read them on the air, mainstream media, where the Optimum Population Trust, another big non-governmental organization backed by the foundations, came out and called for the same policies as China to be mandated in Britain and the rest of Europe.
[01:28:07.103 --> 01:28:08.645]  Very shortly.
[01:28:08.645 --> 01:28:13.050]  They've got front page coverage, whole pages on this.
[01:28:13.050 --> 01:28:17.615]  And the government has some of these characters on their board.
[01:28:17.615 --> 01:28:20.118]  You know, governments appoint people.
[01:28:20.118 --> 01:28:23.002]  The real players are appointed, they're not elected.
[01:28:23.002 --> 01:28:26.726]  And they appoint the tops of these groups on their panels for discussion.
[01:28:27.472 --> 01:28:27.732]  I think?
[01:28:46.758 --> 01:28:54.764]  And let's be clear, these videos of George Hunt that we've been posting for years, a lot of times he's the one even leading the meetings with Maurice Strong there.
[01:28:54.764 --> 01:28:59.348]  And he was there, and they started talking about getting rid of all of us, and this freaked him out, so he brought him out.
[01:29:01.638 --> 01:29:13.543]  Just bone-chilling to then see the New York Times and Washington Post every week with articles about, oh look, the fifth grader comes home and writes up dossiers on mom, and the school has the kids in England and the U.S.
[01:29:13.543 --> 01:29:20.706]  writing mock tickets to their parents for taking a hot bath, or having the wrong kind of light bulb, or using too much A.C.
[01:29:20.706 --> 01:29:23.007]  to the children, the little persecutors now.
[01:29:24.207 --> 01:29:28.349]  And the parents are in the news going, oh, I'm so proud of them tattling on me.
[01:29:28.349 --> 01:29:35.433]  Just like in 1984, where Winston's upstairs neighbor is so proud of his kid that's tattling on him.
[01:29:35.433 --> 01:29:40.276]  And then even when he gets picked up and put in the prison, he goes, I'm so proud that my son turned me in.
[01:29:40.276 --> 01:29:42.878]  I don't know what it is that I did, but I'm sure I'm guilty.
[01:29:42.878 --> 01:29:45.599]  I'm glad Big Brother's going to torture me to death.
[01:29:45.599 --> 01:29:48.901]  And that's basically what the American people and Brits are like now.
[01:29:48.901 --> 01:29:51.162]  It's like, thank God the kids are turning us in.
[01:29:51.162 --> 01:29:51.983]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.504 --> 01:29:55.054]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.054 --> 01:29:57.745]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:31:06.245 --> 01:31:07.546]  Inner Health Botanicals.

[01:31:11.827 --> 01:31:13.687]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[01:31:13.687 --> 01:31:18.628]  And now, the health ranger, Mike Adams, has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award.
[01:31:18.908 --> 01:31:20.750]  Or best superfood of 2009.

[01:31:25.734 --> 01:31:28.736]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[01:31:28.736 --> 01:31:30.458]  And their formula really works.
[01:31:30.458 --> 01:31:33.280]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[01:31:33.280 --> 01:31:34.761]  Try the NutriCafe.
[01:31:34.761 --> 01:31:39.545]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boost the immune system.
[01:31:39.545 --> 01:31:41.947]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[01:31:41.947 --> 01:31:44.429]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[01:31:44.429 --> 01:31:46.171]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[01:31:46.491 --> 01:31:52.173]  Go to www.enerfood.com.
[01:31:52.173 --> 01:31:56.835]  That's www.enerfood.com.

[01:32:00.543 --> 01:32:06.709]  We are surrounded by harmful indoor air that can easily deliver many harmful toxins straight into our bodies.
[01:32:06.709 --> 01:32:08.490]  Take a deep breath.
[01:32:08.490 --> 01:32:15.016]  Can you actually feel the airborne influenza, viruses, mold, bacteria, and dangerous ozone entering your lungs?
[01:32:15.016 --> 01:32:16.578]  Have a glass of water.
[01:32:16.578 --> 01:32:21.442]  Can you taste the harmful chlorine, fluoride, lead, pharmaceutical drugs, and numerous other chemicals?
[01:32:24.667 --> 01:32:24.807]  I think?
[01:32:42.796 --> 01:32:43.136]  I think so.
[01:33:11.403 --> 01:33:12.503]  Yeah, I meant yesterday.
[01:33:12.503 --> 01:33:17.185]  It's funny that Maury Strong got brought up by... Well, it's not funny, it's tragic.
[01:33:17.185 --> 01:33:18.406]  We're on the same page.
[01:33:18.406 --> 01:33:26.749]  By Alan Watt, because I have a clip... I ran into a bunch of clips of him talking about licenses to have even one kid, total control.
[01:33:26.749 --> 01:33:30.410]  Now, that's the goal of the different United Nations treaties.
[01:33:30.410 --> 01:33:32.671]  That's the goal of global warming.
[01:33:32.671 --> 01:33:37.993]  Him in the 70s saying global warming is going to kill us by 2000.
[01:33:37.993 --> 01:33:39.674]  We've got to have one-child policies.
[01:33:41.021 --> 01:33:41.741]  Just incredible.
[01:33:41.741 --> 01:33:45.403]  So we're going to go back to Alan Watt here in just a moment.
[01:33:45.403 --> 01:34:00.151]  I would add, though, that the preeminent film exposing the globalist master plan, their overall agenda, what they have planned for you and your family, is my film, Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement.
[01:34:00.151 --> 01:34:07.995]  Everybody needs to get this DVD at Infowars.com and make copies of it and get it out to everybody because this is the mindset
[01:34:08.735 --> 01:34:10.076]  Of those that govern the planet.
[01:34:10.076 --> 01:34:11.596]  This is their religion.
[01:34:11.596 --> 01:34:14.077]  It is what they work for every waking moment.
[01:34:14.077 --> 01:34:16.678]  To kill the majority of the world population.
[01:34:16.678 --> 01:34:20.220]  And first they've got to build an international straitjacket control grid.
[01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:22.861]  Get you dependent in compact cities.
[01:34:22.861 --> 01:34:27.703]  All of the culling and sterilization and chemical and biological attacks and radiological attacks.
[01:34:27.703 --> 01:34:30.844]  That's all just been beta testing.
[01:34:30.844 --> 01:34:34.025]  Where they were kind of learning how to cook.
[01:34:34.025 --> 01:34:35.286]  Like going to chef school.
[01:34:35.286 --> 01:34:36.386]  Now they've graduated.
[01:34:36.386 --> 01:34:37.647]  Now they're ready to start the killing.
[01:34:38.885 --> 01:34:41.807]  But first, they've got to get you fully on your knees and domesticated.
[01:34:41.807 --> 01:34:59.736]  So please get In-Game Blueprint for Global Enslavement at Infowars.com or call toll free to get it 888-253-3139 888-253-3139 or you can see it in super high quality and burn it to disk and give it to folks at PrisonPlanet.tv.

[01:35:08.462 --> 01:35:10.764]  Then there's the Obama deception.
[01:35:10.764 --> 01:35:12.685]  This shatters the left-right paradigm.
[01:35:12.685 --> 01:35:14.527]  This is designed for the general public.
[01:35:14.527 --> 01:35:21.172]  It's also important viewing and for people that are experts on this, but it's really made for people to understand how the left and right are controlled.
[01:35:21.172 --> 01:35:23.854]  Two false choices in a controlled dialectic.
[01:35:24.694 --> 01:35:28.856]  Where the establishment manages both sides of the system.
[01:35:28.856 --> 01:35:32.517]  So the Obama Deception is available on DVD at Infowars.com as well.
[01:35:32.517 --> 01:35:34.098]  Or again, PrisonPlanet.tv.
[01:35:34.098 --> 01:35:35.178]  See it in super high quality.
[01:35:35.178 --> 01:35:36.859]  It's an arsenal of resistance.
[01:35:36.859 --> 01:35:44.662]  You can make copies of it from PrisonPlanet.tv in the highest quality online with the DivX system that play on most DVD players as well.
[01:35:44.662 --> 01:35:47.583]  I also want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that are making today's
[01:35:48.914 --> 01:35:50.956]  Show possible.
[01:35:50.956 --> 01:35:53.317]  One of them is New Silver Solution.
[01:35:53.317 --> 01:35:58.061]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from resistant strains of deadly bacteria and viruses?
[01:35:58.061 --> 01:36:01.083]  I want you to go to SupernaturalSilver.com today.
[01:36:01.083 --> 01:36:06.107]  Visit the link on InfoWars.com to find out more about this incredible new take on a silver compound.
[01:36:06.107 --> 01:36:12.611]  The New Silver Solution is a natural antibiotic that has been clinically proven to kill viruses, germs, bacteria, and yeast safely.
[01:36:12.611 --> 01:36:16.574]  Now, silver is one of the oldest antibiotics, and this is just atomized out of the smallest
[01:36:17.515 --> 01:36:18.476]  Particle, that's what you want.
[01:36:18.476 --> 01:36:23.000]  It's a new technology and has proven to be a formidable weapon against bio-threats.
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:28.724]  The new silver solution gel has been shown to disinfect topically and keep the area sanitized for up to four hours.
[01:36:28.724 --> 01:36:35.430]  The new silver solution is a highly effective, potent nanoparticle solution that is lethal to bacteria, yeast, and viruses.
[01:36:35.430 --> 01:36:40.234]  So, see, a lot of your antibiotics just do bacteria.
[01:36:40.234 --> 01:36:42.956]  Or antivirals just do viruses.
[01:36:42.956 --> 01:36:44.077]  Silver is good for everything.
[01:36:45.148 --> 01:36:55.504]  We've had medical doctors on that have recommended this, so SupernaturalSilver.com and see the amazing line of products they have available at SupernaturalSilver.com, SupernaturalSilver.com today!
[01:36:56.823 --> 01:37:00.544]  And again, one other sponsor here I want to tell you about is MySolarBackup.com.
[01:37:00.544 --> 01:37:02.484]  A lot of things can cut off your electrical power.
[01:37:02.484 --> 01:37:04.125]  Hurricanes, snow, ice storms.
[01:37:04.125 --> 01:37:08.586]  Listeners should move towards getting off the grid, and here's a good way to start doing just that.
[01:37:08.586 --> 01:37:12.727]  A solar power generator is now available from our great sponsor, Solutions from Science.
[01:37:12.727 --> 01:37:16.068]  You get an emergency power backup kit which consists of the PowerSource 1800 watt generator,
[01:37:17.748 --> 01:37:21.490]  And the high-efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity.
[01:37:21.490 --> 01:37:27.112]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas, but in a blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run on electricity.
[01:37:27.112 --> 01:37:29.633]  This is the perfect emergency backup for terrible times.
[01:37:29.633 --> 01:37:32.674]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks, so make your move today.
[01:37:32.674 --> 01:37:33.874]  MySolarBackup.com.
[01:37:33.874 --> 01:37:36.075]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[01:37:36.075 --> 01:37:37.196]  One word, MySolarBackup.com.
[01:37:37.196 --> 01:37:37.376]  Or 877-327-0365.
[01:37:37.376 --> 01:37:37.476]  877-327-0365.
[01:37:37.476 --> 01:37:38.196]  MySolarBackup.com.
[01:37:46.019 --> 01:37:51.181]  Okay, thank you, Alan, for holding while I thank our sponsors that make this whole operation possible.
[01:37:51.181 --> 01:37:56.744]  Don't forget to support Alan with his great books and videos he has available at CuttingThroughTheMatrix.com.
[01:37:56.744 --> 01:38:09.989]  Okay, Alan, again, you keep pausing for me to interrupt customarily, and I do add, I think, some important points, but I really want you to sit down and continue rolling with their operation, their plan, what's coming next, some of the other facets.
[01:38:09.989 --> 01:38:11.790]  Really, I normally guide the interviews.
[01:38:11.790 --> 01:38:14.751]  I'd like to sit back and let you follow your fancy.
[01:38:15.509 --> 01:38:19.771]  Well, what we have really is a very ingenious plan.
[01:38:19.771 --> 01:38:22.713]  It's going to use environmentalism and a war.
[01:38:22.713 --> 01:38:30.196]  Remember the Club of Rome, one of the premier think tanks that not predicts the future, they create the future.
[01:38:30.196 --> 01:38:34.358]  They create realities for the upcoming generations.
[01:38:34.358 --> 01:38:41.302]  They come up with the ideas and they give it to the lesser think tanks to find ways to implement it through media, movies, novels, through society.
[01:38:42.458 --> 01:38:47.702]  Well, he came up in the 1970s with the idea of global warming.
[01:38:47.702 --> 01:38:58.450]  And they say in their own book, the two founders say in their own book, the first global revolution, that they were looking for a way to unite the entire planet under a warfare scenario.
[01:38:58.450 --> 01:38:59.951]  It would have to be warfare because
[01:39:00.686 --> 01:39:06.729]  When there's war, like world war going on, the public will allow their rights to be taken away from them.
[01:39:06.729 --> 01:39:08.870]  They'll all work together for less.
[01:39:08.870 --> 01:39:12.012]  They'll eat less food and rationing and so on.
[01:39:12.012 --> 01:39:16.314]  And they have a common purpose, a common cause, as they think they do.
[01:39:16.314 --> 01:39:23.378]  And government can then expand and take over various areas of their lives, which didn't interfere before.
[01:39:23.956 --> 01:39:30.142]  Yes, for a war scenario had to be dreamed up, and the one that they hit upon was global warming.
[01:39:30.142 --> 01:39:32.424]  They said that would fit the bill.
[01:39:32.424 --> 01:39:33.445]  That's their own words.
[01:39:33.445 --> 01:39:34.646]  That would fit the bill.
[01:39:34.646 --> 01:39:38.329]  After looking at other ways to do it, that one would fit the bill.
[01:39:38.329 --> 01:39:44.695]  When these guys come to a decision like this, and they're unanimous, they never change their agenda.
[01:39:45.663 --> 01:39:49.286]  So if it's written 30 years ago, 40 years ago, you can take it to the bank.
[01:39:49.286 --> 01:39:50.948]  They will carry it through.
[01:39:50.948 --> 01:39:55.692]  Even if we're up to our eyes in the snow, they'll still say it's global warming.
[01:39:55.692 --> 01:40:02.217]  Now, under this guise of environment and saving the world's environment, because man's at war with environment, that's what they say.
[01:40:02.217 --> 01:40:03.838]  Man's the enemy.
[01:40:03.838 --> 01:40:09.743]  We all have to reduce our populations, which ties in exactly with the United Nations.
[01:40:09.743 --> 01:40:10.224]  They've said
[01:40:11.521 --> 01:40:23.087]  In their own charter for the Department of Agriculture, the United Nations ultimately will be responsible for doling out the food to every nation in a quota system.
[01:40:23.087 --> 01:40:26.769]  And eventually, they'll use it as a weapon.
[01:40:26.769 --> 01:40:32.032]  If you don't reduce your population, say, in the United States, they'll give you less rationing.
[01:40:32.032 --> 01:40:37.775]  And of course, even if you try and keep up, or keep to the right quota of population,
[01:40:39.100 --> 01:40:46.405]  They'll give you less next year or two years time once you're used to the idea until you keep reducing and reducing and reducing your population.
[01:40:46.405 --> 01:40:49.967]  So there's this incentive to have children.
[01:40:49.967 --> 01:40:51.008]  And we already see that.
[01:40:51.008 --> 01:40:54.350]  California's getting rid of the tax credit for children.
[01:40:54.350 --> 01:41:01.594]  Australia's gotten rid of it entirely and now says in their news they're going to start taxing having kids.
[01:41:01.594 --> 01:41:04.416]  And then they even have parents come on that are stakeholders.
[01:41:04.416 --> 01:41:05.977]  That means they're minions.
[01:41:05.977 --> 01:41:06.718]  They always have these little
[01:41:07.778 --> 01:41:29.230]  I think it's a great idea and I had the British scientist on last year who was all over the news calling for wartime rationing of food and water and carbon footprints, water footprints, to have laws to make us skinnier, not eat as much, being fat is bad for the earth.
[01:41:30.148 --> 01:41:30.408]  Absolutely.
[01:41:30.408 --> 01:41:33.549]  They've been using techniques like this for years on children at school.
[01:41:57.722 --> 01:42:00.528]  And I would speak to go into the adult world as well.
[01:42:00.528 --> 01:42:08.264]  And what they're training us is that we have no privacy, of course, that government inspectors can come into your homes at any time, regardless if you think you own it or not.
[01:42:09.705 --> 01:42:11.686]  Unisex bathrooms.
[01:42:11.686 --> 01:42:22.451]  All of this is about destroying all privacy, all identity, anything that's associated with normal biological activity in the species must be destroyed.
[01:42:22.451 --> 01:42:28.954]  Anything, in other words, that you would naturally fight for, they're creating you not to fight, but just to acquiesce and give in.
[01:42:28.954 --> 01:42:31.355]  That's the whole key to, we're getting trained.
[01:42:31.355 --> 01:42:33.756]  And under the threat of environment, the catastrophe
[01:42:34.523 --> 01:42:36.265]  Uh, then they're going to use this.
[01:42:36.265 --> 01:42:44.692]  They're already using it, of course, to come into your life and every single aspect of your life, right down to what you eat and how much you eat and are you eating meat?
[01:42:44.692 --> 01:42:48.636]  The Royal Society put out a report the other day.
[01:42:48.636 --> 01:42:52.379]  Now the Royal Society is an incredible society.
[01:42:52.379 --> 01:42:54.121]  It's got a royal charter to exist.
[01:42:55.177 --> 01:42:58.659]  And every famous scientist that's ever existed was a member of it.
[01:42:58.659 --> 01:43:09.924]  But it also has listed openly, in its own records and history, that it was the first totally freemasonic scientific institution ever set up.
[01:43:09.924 --> 01:43:13.386]  So, these guys literally, again, are part of the big think tanks.
[01:43:13.386 --> 01:43:18.789]  They help plan the future on a political, a socio-political basis.
[01:43:18.789 --> 01:43:22.911]  And they have said that we should stop eating red meats.
[01:43:23.666 --> 01:43:28.927]  Now, what's the Royal Society doing telling us to stop eating red meat, you see?
[01:43:28.927 --> 01:43:45.091]  Until you tie it in with their agenda, because we find that HG Wells, in his book, Utopia, and he was an earlier member of the same organisation, he said the world we'll bring in will be vegetarian, completely vegetarian worldwide.
[01:43:45.091 --> 01:43:49.092]  You find the same thing in Toffler's book, Alvin Toffler, the big futurist,
[01:43:49.665 --> 01:43:54.187]  The pal of Newt Gingrich, who gave out his book to every congressman in the U.S.
[01:43:54.187 --> 01:43:56.628]  It's called The Third Wave.
[01:43:56.628 --> 01:44:01.050]  And in it, he says, the world we shall bring in will be vegetarian, and it must be so.
[01:44:01.050 --> 01:44:03.130]  He doesn't say why.
[01:44:03.130 --> 01:44:12.514]  So, right down to what we eat, vegetarian diet and all the rest of it, it's all planned for us, and under saving the environment, they're going to force us off protein, believe you me.
[01:44:12.514 --> 01:44:14.255]  Because, why protein?
[01:44:14.255 --> 01:44:19.257]  When you look at India, and these guys use histories, very ancient histories,
[01:44:19.787 --> 01:44:23.229]  And recent and modern histories as well, to the full.
[01:44:23.229 --> 01:44:29.152]  And they always have historians on board, and philosophers, you'll find in the top think tanks.
[01:44:29.152 --> 01:44:37.436]  India has been ruled, basically, by Brahmins, the Brahmin caste or class, for thousands of years.
[01:44:37.436 --> 01:44:47.241]  And the most easy people, the easiest people to get to obey you, because sluggish in certain ways and so on, are people who are malnourished on a very minimal diet.
[01:44:47.241 --> 01:44:49.222]  I'm talking about a full vegetarian diet here,
[01:44:50.214 --> 01:44:59.377]  Once they're in charge of your food, you'll find that even the vegetables become restricted and restricted until you're missing out on vital amino acids and so on.
[01:44:59.377 --> 01:45:00.738]  But you're very compliant.
[01:45:00.738 --> 01:45:01.638]  You're not too bright.
[01:45:01.638 --> 01:45:02.878]  You do what you're told.
[01:45:02.878 --> 01:45:04.579]  You certainly will never rebel.
[01:45:04.579 --> 01:45:05.799]  And that's the technique.
[01:45:05.799 --> 01:45:08.840]  That's why they want to bring in the vegetarian world.
[01:45:08.840 --> 01:45:16.063]  And of course they're very advanced in genetic engineering and magically they continue to change the different
[01:45:17.256 --> 01:45:26.426]  Structures of GMO tomatoes, potatoes, corn, where it sterilizes all the guinea pigs and rats and other rodents they're feeding them to.
[01:45:26.426 --> 01:45:26.827]  And I've had
[01:45:28.103 --> 01:45:32.547]  Top genetic engineers on saying they believe this isn't by accident.
[01:45:32.547 --> 01:45:32.867]  No.
[01:45:32.867 --> 01:45:42.374]  So they're going in and making the very food we eat sterilizes and we then see the sperm counts dropping, fertility in women plunging.
[01:45:42.374 --> 01:45:45.517]  We're the globalists, have been in control of the West.
[01:45:45.517 --> 01:45:50.361]  We see the death of the West with on average a 1.3 replacement rate.
[01:45:50.361 --> 01:45:51.442]  Please continue.
[01:45:51.442 --> 01:45:55.605]  Yeah, they weaponized the food and you see again
[01:45:56.867 --> 01:46:15.718]  In this world, the world that they decided they were going to bring in an awful long time ago, they said, and this even came out in the Cold War, in different books and so on, they said that no truly big international corporation dealing in technology or science could be allowed to be free to go its own way.
[01:46:15.718 --> 01:46:21.382]  They even said that the Cold War would be won with those countries and nations with superior sciences.
[01:46:21.382 --> 01:46:25.244]  Now remember, food comes under warfare, it always has since ancient times.
[01:46:26.829 --> 01:46:40.980]  Monsanto and all these big boys that have an ear to Presidents and Prime Ministers across the world, once again, a special ear I call it, dictate to governments as to what they want and they always get what they want.
[01:46:40.980 --> 01:46:51.629]  Now, they're part of the military-industrial complex when you go into the history of Monsanto and the chemical industry and Ancient Orange and all the rest of it that they've used in past times.
[01:46:52.338 --> 01:47:01.621]  You don't bring hundreds of top genetic scientists together that formerly were working in the only places they could work, and that was in the warfare industry.
[01:47:01.621 --> 01:47:06.102]  You don't bring them together to make a better carrot or a better potato.
[01:47:06.102 --> 01:47:09.763]  You do it because you are truly what you eat.
[01:47:09.763 --> 01:47:18.465]  Well, look at the one plastic they unified out of hundreds of different formulas that didn't leach estrogen-mimicking hormones.
[01:47:18.465 --> 01:47:20.126]  They had global adoption in the 60s.
[01:47:21.824 --> 01:47:51.145]  of the class of plastic that leeches it and now they admit it's going on and say well in a way that's a good thing and maybe we should put this in the water to stop you having kids and they put this on the news now and the yuppies go yeah do that to those poor people not knowing they're under the gun as well so that's one of their master points is making kind of the low-level minions feel like they're part of this predatory power trip but expanding on that
[01:47:53.296 --> 01:48:01.560]  If you look at the GMO foods, again, it's been confirmed to be sterilizing people.
[01:48:01.560 --> 01:48:06.142]  I want the population to understand that we're not just saying this.
[01:48:06.142 --> 01:48:06.982]  This is really happening.
[01:48:06.982 --> 01:48:07.803]  Go ahead.
[01:48:07.803 --> 01:48:21.589]  Well, plus you have... Whenever you get something that you'd think would be a crisis like the males of the West being 80% down on sperm count, what's left is almost immobile.
[01:48:21.589 --> 01:48:22.209]  It's not moving.
[01:48:23.286 --> 01:48:24.008]  I don't think so.
[01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:35.920]  Then they go in about it.
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:42.004]  They'll give the stats on different kinds of cancers that have exploded since the 1950s as well.
[01:48:42.004 --> 01:48:43.665]  And this is all normal now.
[01:48:43.665 --> 01:48:45.326]  There's no crisis made about it.
[01:48:45.326 --> 01:48:47.987]  Well, how come there's no crisis made about it?
[01:48:47.987 --> 01:48:50.148]  It's because it's part of the agenda.
[01:48:50.148 --> 01:48:54.471]  That's why they can calmly give you statistics and without mentioning the obvious.
[01:48:54.471 --> 01:48:57.993]  My God, everyone's becoming sterile or dying of cancer.
[01:48:57.993 --> 01:48:59.293]  That's the agenda.
[01:48:59.293 --> 01:49:02.075]  This is part of the population reduction control.
[01:49:02.075 --> 01:49:02.195]  Now,
[01:49:03.112 --> 01:49:11.923]  Years ago, I read an article on Prince Charles, whose, I remember, all these, the nobility of Europe and America.
[01:49:11.923 --> 01:49:14.265]  America has a nobility.
[01:49:14.265 --> 01:49:17.149]  They have their private estates where they have tenant farmers.
[01:49:17.149 --> 01:49:19.351]  That's down through the centuries.
[01:49:19.351 --> 01:49:22.255]  They've done television shows on them in Britain and elsewhere.
[01:49:23.001 --> 01:49:29.344]  They have their own vast herds of Angus beef and all the rest of it that do not eat anything that's modified.
[01:49:29.344 --> 01:49:33.787]  They have their fields of their wheat and their corn and all the rest of it, but it's not modified.
[01:49:33.787 --> 01:49:36.628]  They have their sources of supply.
[01:49:36.628 --> 01:49:44.732]  But they're making sure, by law, that we are going to eat all this modified stuff, the weaponized stuff, because it's part of the plan.
[01:49:44.732 --> 01:49:45.813]  That's the reason for it.
[01:49:49.056 --> 01:49:51.038]  Jay Rockefeller.
[01:49:51.038 --> 01:49:52.118]  Sorry, go ahead.
[01:49:52.118 --> 01:49:54.080]  Yeah, never mind what I've done.
[01:49:54.080 --> 01:50:00.585]  You see, we forget too that the most potent drugs ever developed came from plants.
[01:50:00.585 --> 01:50:02.406]  You can make plants grow anything.
[01:50:02.406 --> 01:50:10.452]  We know how far advanced they are to do with brain chemistry and today with the various high potent drugs they have.
[01:50:10.973 --> 01:50:11.474]  Thank you for
[01:50:27.797 --> 01:50:28.678]  All right.
[01:50:28.678 --> 01:50:29.319]  Absolutely.
[01:50:29.319 --> 01:50:42.093]  At the United Nations Food Conference in 96 in China, the Director General of the Food Program said we will use food as a weapon and we don't apologize for it.
[01:50:42.974 --> 01:51:00.041]  When we come back, I'm going to back you up, Alan Watt, because there's an entire industry for decades called pharmacological crops, where they brag they can make the plants do whatever they want them to do, and they're medicalizing them and using them as weapons against us right now.
[01:51:00.041 --> 01:51:00.542]  Stay with us.
[01:51:00.542 --> 01:51:01.182]  Key information.
[01:51:02.236 --> 01:51:13.421]  The New World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food, mixing vegetables with animals, and now experimenting with viruses.
[01:51:13.421 --> 01:51:19.404]  Without a long-term food solution, you will have just two options.
[01:51:19.404 --> 01:51:22.885]  Starve or surrender.
[01:51:22.885 --> 01:51:28.227]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out.
[01:51:28.227 --> 01:51:28.848]  What then?
[01:51:30.609 --> 01:51:33.690]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever.
[01:51:33.690 --> 01:51:37.992]  SurvivalistSeeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company.

[01:52:01.354 --> 01:52:07.396]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[01:52:07.396 --> 01:52:13.277]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[01:52:13.277 --> 01:52:19.439]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[01:52:19.759 --> 01:52:21.740]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[01:52:21.740 --> 01:52:24.202]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[01:52:24.202 --> 01:52:37.391]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[01:52:37.391 --> 01:52:39.072]  It's not about left or right.
[01:52:39.072 --> 01:52:40.934]  It's about a one-world government.
[01:52:40.934 --> 01:52:47.158]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[01:54:29.300 --> 01:54:34.561]  We also have clips of them talking about how we're cannon fodder.
[01:54:34.561 --> 01:54:35.902]  The Scum!
[01:54:35.902 --> 01:54:37.162]  We've almost got them!
[01:54:37.162 --> 01:54:37.562]  Look at them!
[01:54:37.562 --> 01:54:38.962]  They're almost sterile!
[01:54:38.962 --> 01:54:40.603]  They're all dying of cancer!
[01:54:42.790 --> 01:54:43.870]  They'll never fight us.
[01:54:43.870 --> 01:54:45.911]  Look at those police serving us.
[01:54:45.911 --> 01:54:47.871]  Thinking they're part of the system.
[01:54:47.871 --> 01:54:49.492]  All implanted.
[01:54:49.492 --> 01:54:56.874]  When the hormonal fluctuation triggers, it will metastasize.
[01:54:56.874 --> 01:54:57.814]  All on record.
[01:54:57.814 --> 01:55:00.875]  All laughing at you.
[01:55:00.875 --> 01:55:03.375]  They're talking about Republicans and Democrats.
[01:55:03.375 --> 01:55:06.416]  Labor and Tories.
[01:55:06.416 --> 01:55:09.237]  As if there's any deal to the little slaves.
[01:55:11.374 --> 01:55:14.698]  Alan Watt is our guest.
[01:55:14.698 --> 01:55:21.987]  I remember about six years ago, I read on air an AP report about a Texas-based company, Protegene.
[01:55:23.496 --> 01:55:28.637]  And it said that they had a pharmacological crop that grew live AIDS virus in the corn.
[01:55:28.637 --> 01:55:33.878]  And then it had been open-air planted, and then they'd violated some rule, and so it had to be destroyed.
[01:55:33.878 --> 01:55:35.638]  And it also produced a bunch of other things.
[01:55:35.638 --> 01:55:40.199]  And people called me, didn't believe that they have crops that grow live viruses or bacteria.
[01:55:40.199 --> 01:55:48.881]  The BT corn, one of the most popular corns out there, has been linked by major government studies in Germany and Europe, and also in China, to killing the honeybees.
[01:55:48.881 --> 01:55:53.122]  Because it's a live pesticide that is grown in the corn itself, and you still eat it.
[01:55:54.318 --> 01:55:58.173]  Now this is all a big joke, and everything's about sterilization.
[01:55:59.184 --> 01:56:04.267]  And so now they're cracking down on organic farming and everything because, folks, they mean business.
[01:56:04.267 --> 01:56:05.628]  This is life and death.
[01:56:05.628 --> 01:56:06.709]  They are eugenicists.
[01:56:06.709 --> 01:56:08.970]  And so they have thousands.
[01:56:08.970 --> 01:56:24.920]  In fact, Google right now, everybody, just minimize that video, pharmacological crops, that term, pharmacological crops, you'll get millions of hits all announcing, oh, this crop's got 14 different animal and 10 different plant and five different insect genes.
[01:56:25.760 --> 01:56:34.009]  It produces all these chemicals or it produces a live virus and we harvest it for vaccines because they can program plants to do whatever they want.
[01:56:34.009 --> 01:56:39.595]  Then you tell the public, kind of like the famous story of me saying they have spider goats, part spider, part goat.
[01:56:39.595 --> 01:56:42.939]  Then I had the CEO of the company on in upstate New York at an army base.
[01:56:44.068 --> 01:56:46.569]  And it produces body armor out of the milk.
[01:56:46.569 --> 01:56:51.349]  And I had a guy at Conan's Pizza, I was picking a pizza up, come up and poke me in the back and almost start a fight.
[01:56:51.349 --> 01:56:52.870]  I used to like you, but you're a liar.
[01:56:52.870 --> 01:56:56.470]  I took biology at UT and they don't have part spider goats.
[01:56:56.470 --> 01:56:58.631]  And I said, sir, it's CBS News.
[01:56:58.631 --> 01:57:00.651]  And he got in my face and kind of almost bulled up.
[01:57:00.651 --> 01:57:04.572]  And I had to say, look, not lying, but believe what you want.
[01:57:04.572 --> 01:57:07.393]  They, Allen, they think we're living in 1900.
[01:57:07.393 --> 01:57:09.373]  They don't know this is Buck Rogers.
[01:57:10.342 --> 01:57:10.922]  That's right.
[01:57:10.922 --> 01:57:20.607]  The average person has been given the biggest mind job in this generation than any previous generations ever had before.
[01:57:20.607 --> 01:57:29.112]  And Brzezinski, Brzezinski is such a massive player in all this, but he is an expert on the mind of populations.
[01:57:29.112 --> 01:57:32.034]  He was the head of the NSA for a long, long time.
[01:57:32.034 --> 01:57:34.755]  He's been an advisor to I think every president behind the scenes.
[01:57:35.837 --> 01:57:45.665]  And he said himself that shortly the public, in his own book Between Two Ages, shortly the public will be unable to reason for themselves.
[01:57:45.665 --> 01:57:48.788]  They'll truly believe the news media.
[01:57:48.788 --> 01:57:52.731]  In fact, they'll look at the news media as an extension of the reasoning powers.
[01:57:52.731 --> 01:57:54.533]  The media will do the reasoning for them.
[01:57:55.367 --> 01:57:56.308]  I don't think so.
[01:58:07.039 --> 01:58:07.680]  That's right.
[01:58:07.680 --> 01:58:10.562]  And the public, too, will believe the same thing that you tell them.
[01:58:10.562 --> 01:58:14.185]  If Barbara Walters comes on and spins it, that's okay.
[01:58:14.185 --> 01:58:16.267]  It's suddenly talked about all over.
[01:58:16.267 --> 01:58:18.449]  But if you say it, no, you're nobody, you think.
[01:58:31.141 --> 01:58:31.761]  Exactly.
[01:58:31.761 --> 01:58:37.725]  It exists when they say it, because they're saying it's good, but when you say it, it simultaneously doesn't exist.
[01:58:37.725 --> 01:58:39.046]  That's double-triple things.
[01:58:39.046 --> 01:58:39.466]  Stay there.
[01:58:39.466 --> 01:58:41.727]  Back in one minute.
[01:58:41.727 --> 01:58:46.430]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.430 --> 01:58:48.271]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:50.794 --> 01:58:56.016]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[01:58:56.016 --> 01:59:00.038]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:59:00.038 --> 01:59:05.940]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.940 --> 01:59:11.003]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:11.003 --> 01:59:11.503]  Number three,
[01:59:11.923 --> 01:59:18.208]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[01:59:18.208 --> 01:59:21.110]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[01:59:21.110 --> 01:59:25.634]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:25.634 --> 01:59:29.237]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:59:29.477 --> 01:59:35.198]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[01:59:35.198 --> 01:59:39.899]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:39.899 --> 01:59:41.680]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:44.260]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.

[01:59:53.623 --> 01:59:56.003]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.003 --> 01:59:58.744]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.256 --> 02:00:10.101]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[02:00:10.101 --> 02:00:11.683]  You want answers?
[02:00:11.683 --> 02:00:12.584]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:12.584 --> 02:00:17.429]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.429 --> 02:00:21.473]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.717 --> 02:00:25.319]  The establishment through psychological warfare.
[02:00:25.319 --> 02:00:31.865]  One thing they do is they make the yuppies and the know-it-alls and the general public slaves who aren't even tuned in to news.
[02:00:31.865 --> 02:00:41.393]  There's the controlled paradigm of news, but below that there's the strata of people that just watch sports and act cool all day or, you know, basically don't even know the three branches of government.
[02:00:42.591 --> 02:00:46.473]  They get them to identify with being ignorant, that it's cool to be stupid.
[02:00:46.473 --> 02:00:53.818]  In all these teenager movies and TV show, the guy that gets all the girls is the guy that doesn't care about politics or the world or history.
[02:00:53.818 --> 02:01:00.022]  Until the public becomes Miss Teen South Carolina, who can't even talk.
[02:01:01.567 --> 02:01:14.339]  And then she's honored by the media for being what you're supposed to be like, that it's cool and beautiful to be an empty-headed idiot who's going happily up the carousel at Logan's Run, you know, to be euthanized.
[02:01:14.339 --> 02:01:17.182]  So, they value their ignorance.
[02:01:17.182 --> 02:01:18.764]  They value their bondage.
[02:01:18.764 --> 02:01:19.845]  They will say,
[02:01:20.285 --> 02:01:22.266]  There is no such thing as a new world order for decades.
[02:01:22.266 --> 02:01:27.690]  Now they announce, oh, it's a new bank of the world, world government, carbon taxes, you'll pay to private banks.
[02:01:27.690 --> 02:01:29.431]  And we go, hey, we said that forever.
[02:01:29.431 --> 02:01:33.894]  And I've basically had major newspapers tell me, well, Alex, you're still basically crazy.
[02:01:35.000 --> 02:01:44.108]  The stuff exists, but you were just kind of lucky in your schizophrenia you imagined all this, and now it's happening, but it's good, but you're still crazy.
[02:01:44.108 --> 02:01:45.249]  Or it goes further.
[02:01:45.249 --> 02:01:48.432]  This stuff exists, but it doesn't exist.
[02:01:48.432 --> 02:01:53.076]  It exists when the establishment says it, but then it doesn't exist when you say it exists but is bad.
[02:01:53.717 --> 02:01:57.180]  Well, again, very good books have been written on this particular type of psychology.
[02:02:19.881 --> 02:02:21.302]  to do with the masses.
[02:02:21.302 --> 02:02:25.444]  One very old book was simply called Propaganda, written in the 1800s.
[02:02:25.444 --> 02:02:30.826]  That was the start of it, and then Bernays picked up on it, the nephew of Freud.
[02:02:30.826 --> 02:02:39.610]  And people don't even know that Freud's nephews are still advising British governments today on mass psychology, direct descendants from Freud.
[02:02:39.610 --> 02:02:46.894]  But Bernays picked up on it, and he knew how to manipulate mass cultures to create what was called a sameness.
[02:02:46.894 --> 02:02:47.474]  A sameness.
[02:02:49.315 --> 02:02:56.040]  Because the first step towards government running, the masses, the masses must be the masses.
[02:02:56.040 --> 02:02:58.021]  You can have no individuality.
[02:02:58.021 --> 02:03:11.291]  Therefore, at the same time, and Bernays, by the way, at 23 years of age, was picked to go with President Wilson to set up the League of Nations, because they knew this was the embryo for a world government.
[02:03:11.291 --> 02:03:18.216]  And right from the beginning, they wanted to start to see how they could get diverse cultures all on the same direction.
[02:03:19.439 --> 02:03:25.083]  And he said they would use feminism to break up the family as well, and he's the reason we eat bacon with eggs.
[02:03:25.083 --> 02:03:28.906]  They had feminists walk with cigarettes, smoking them.
[02:03:28.906 --> 02:03:30.207]  And they said that's even better.
[02:03:30.207 --> 02:03:34.370]  Then we can kill the women with the cigarettes, but it'll make it cool as we murder them.
[02:03:34.370 --> 02:03:35.891]  And the women are like, oh, I'm dying.
[02:03:35.891 --> 02:03:37.092]  I love being conned.
[02:03:37.092 --> 02:03:39.794]  It's just all just hardcore savage.
[02:03:39.794 --> 02:03:41.375]  But they also knew what they did.
[02:03:41.375 --> 02:03:46.879]  They broke down man and woman through all the stages of development from childhood onwards.
[02:03:47.555 --> 02:03:55.218]  And created massive marketing departments through Madison Avenue to cater to every single age group and gender, etc.
[02:03:55.218 --> 02:04:02.661]  With the intent that 50 years down the road they start to bring the differences of the gender into the one same stream.
[02:04:02.661 --> 02:04:04.782]  And that's when unisex broke out.
[02:04:04.782 --> 02:04:05.862]  The unisex fashions.
[02:04:05.862 --> 02:04:09.064]  Everything was the same, male and female and so on.
[02:04:09.064 --> 02:04:11.905]  They planned this, as I say, at the end of World War I.
[02:04:12.347 --> 02:04:13.788]  And that's a cult society.
[02:04:13.788 --> 02:04:14.869]  Everybody looking the same.
[02:04:14.869 --> 02:04:16.290]  Everybody talking the same.
[02:04:16.290 --> 02:04:17.291]  Dressing the same.
[02:04:17.291 --> 02:04:19.712]  Vowing to global on.
[02:04:19.712 --> 02:04:32.822]  And controlling all the other little fake niches and creating fake counterculture movements to carry new New World Order changes in to make it trendy and cool to then progress people into the crucible when all it is is a
[02:04:35.083 --> 02:04:35.684]  We're good to go.
[02:04:48.376 --> 02:04:50.817]  And you can even say, look at the moths being burned up.
[02:04:50.817 --> 02:04:52.638]  You know, look at all the girls dying of Gardasil.
[02:04:52.638 --> 02:04:54.899]  And they go, shut up, I'm giving my daughter the shot.
[02:04:54.899 --> 02:04:56.320]  The daughters are having the convulsion.
[02:04:56.320 --> 02:04:58.801]  The mother claps, oh, she's dying.
[02:04:58.801 --> 02:05:00.061]  Oh, I'm liberal.
[02:05:00.061 --> 02:05:01.042]  Oh, I'm murdering my daughter.
[02:05:01.042 --> 02:05:01.862]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:05:01.862 --> 02:05:03.843]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:05:03.843 --> 02:05:04.483]  Well, you should.

[02:06:02.458 --> 02:06:07.221]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:06:07.221 --> 02:06:10.182]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:06:10.182 --> 02:06:13.224]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:06:13.224 --> 02:06:17.926]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:06:18.166 --> 02:06:19.288]  If you simply prepare.
[02:06:19.288 --> 02:06:22.532]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.

[02:07:59.855 --> 02:08:02.176]  Big Brother.
[02:08:07.120 --> 02:08:08.882]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:08.882 --> 02:08:10.643]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:10.643 --> 02:08:12.225]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.225 --> 02:08:13.786]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.786 --> 02:08:17.990]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:22.053]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:33.070 --> 02:08:36.952]  Okay, we've got Alan Watt with us for the rest of the hour.
[02:08:36.952 --> 02:08:39.413]  I've got a lot of news items I want to throw out at him.
[02:08:39.413 --> 02:08:45.655]  But I also want to open the phones up, starting in the next segment, any issue, any item you'd like to ask Alan Watt or myself.
[02:08:45.655 --> 02:08:47.316]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[02:08:47.316 --> 02:08:55.299]  The websites are PrisonPlanet.tv, JonesReport.com, InfoWars.com, and many, many others, TheObamaDeception.net.
[02:08:55.299 --> 02:09:02.482]  Alan, continue in this segment getting into their master plan, but also, from your perspective and research,
[02:09:04.108 --> 02:09:15.554]  Why they're accelerating their program so much, because according to a lot of their documents and statements, they plan on having the world tax, world government, world regulation in by stealth by 2000.
[02:09:15.554 --> 02:09:18.315]  By most yardsticks they're about four to five years behind.
[02:09:20.618 --> 02:09:24.182]  But overall, they are very optimistic that their new world order is now forming.
[02:09:37.037 --> 02:09:38.737]  Commanding the entire structure.
[02:09:38.737 --> 02:09:42.658]  They're now saying forced inoculations are coming on every news channel.
[02:09:42.658 --> 02:09:44.358]  It's for your own good.
[02:09:44.358 --> 02:09:44.858]  Training us.
[02:09:44.858 --> 02:09:46.239]  We've got to be locked down.
[02:09:46.239 --> 02:09:47.799]  Brigade Homeland.
[02:09:47.799 --> 02:09:50.279]  NORTHCOM's got to keep you safe.
[02:09:50.279 --> 02:09:55.140]  Oh, foreign troops in FEMA National Level Exercise 2009.
[02:09:55.140 --> 02:10:00.781]  They're preparing, working with our military to quote deal with American terrorists.
[02:10:00.781 --> 02:10:02.922]  This is from FEMA's own website.
[02:10:02.922 --> 02:10:04.702]  So right now it looks like
[02:10:05.848 --> 02:10:08.510]  They're accelerating the change, as Lenin said.
[02:10:08.510 --> 02:10:14.633]  There are times in history when more happens in a month than happened in the previous hundred years, to paraphrase.
[02:10:14.633 --> 02:10:17.115]  So clearly we're entering a jump point.
[02:10:17.115 --> 02:10:21.497]  Are we in the major flux point, the flash point, the jump point of change?
[02:10:21.497 --> 02:10:29.422]  Or is this acceleration of change just a prelude to a bigger cataclysm of massive change coming in the future?
[02:10:29.422 --> 02:10:32.564]  And when is that date from your deep research, Alan Watt?
[02:10:32.564 --> 02:10:34.945]  Yeah, we're going through the preparation for it now.
[02:10:37.113 --> 02:10:45.201]  Since 2001, I always look back and I say, my God, look how many crises and fake crises and false crises we've had since 2001.
[02:10:45.201 --> 02:10:53.849]  We've had the environment hit us at the same time, oh my God, the climate change, global warming, and taxes for all of that at the same time.
[02:10:53.849 --> 02:10:55.331]  And the terrorists!
[02:10:55.331 --> 02:10:57.833]  Terrorists, they're just everywhere, like the movie Brazil.
[02:10:57.833 --> 02:11:00.636]  No one ever finds them, but they're supposedly all over the place.
[02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:05.122]  And then the coming pandemics and plagues at the same time.
[02:11:05.122 --> 02:11:06.362]  And then the banking crash.
[02:11:06.362 --> 02:11:09.724]  They gave us a banking crash just to make sure that we got the message.
[02:11:09.724 --> 02:11:11.104]  And then they bail out the banks.
[02:11:11.104 --> 02:11:18.247]  And at the same time, they've just come out and said they're going to give billions of dollars to third world countries to help their environment and so on.
[02:11:18.247 --> 02:11:20.148]  I mean, this is impossible.
[02:11:20.148 --> 02:11:28.432]  If this was spread over a 20 year period, with every single event, we'd have time to think and talk and say, I don't quite grab this.
[02:11:28.432 --> 02:11:29.172]  It smells wrong.
[02:11:29.670 --> 02:11:39.457]  But once they get the people in a stampeding mode, and that's the training of it, we're being stampeded into simply being feared and obey authority, then they can speed it up.
[02:11:39.457 --> 02:11:43.479]  In fact, they must speed it up and give us one incredible scenario after another.
[02:12:00.251 --> 02:12:08.398]  And so will it be a release flu that kills the people or is it going to be those inoculations as they inject people and they get sick and die in front of everyone?
[02:12:08.398 --> 02:12:17.946]  We know the Gardasil and the Factor 8 and all the other soft kill murder operations are beta test of their killing systems but also beta testing the response.
[02:12:18.547 --> 02:12:19.367]  It's all processes.
[02:12:19.367 --> 02:12:20.368]  It's techniques, actually.
[02:12:42.469 --> 02:12:46.692]  The thing with depopulation, as you say, is we're all in it together.
[02:12:46.692 --> 02:12:50.574]  In a war scenario, that's a common slogan you see plastered everywhere.
[02:12:50.574 --> 02:12:52.015]  We're all in it together.
[02:12:52.015 --> 02:12:54.157]  It's all working along the same path.
[02:12:54.157 --> 02:12:55.458]  We all suffer together.
[02:12:55.458 --> 02:12:57.119]  We all die together.
[02:12:57.119 --> 02:13:01.842]  And what you've got, also at the same time, is the cult of celebrity.
[02:13:02.867 --> 02:13:08.672]  Because the celebrity is really part of culture creation and manipulation.
[02:13:08.672 --> 02:13:11.474]  Everything comes from the top, what the stars say.
[02:13:11.474 --> 02:13:13.796]  In fact, the stars override even the scientists.
[02:13:13.796 --> 02:13:19.621]  If you get a famous star to come out and talk about the environment, the people will just gobble it up and think it's true.
[02:13:19.621 --> 02:13:23.484]  So we're managed in a scientific manner perfectly.
[02:13:23.706 --> 02:13:39.034]  But the elite don't have total control, because 37,000 top scientists send a detailed paper and a signed petition, but it gets almost zero news coverage, and Al Gore laughs and says they're all conspiracy theorists that think we didn't land on the moon.
[02:13:39.034 --> 02:13:39.954]  That's right.
[02:13:39.954 --> 02:13:50.039]  And we must remember, too, it is an ominous thing that people don't generally think about, because we're trained to believe, and we have been deliberately trained to believe, that the medical profession is just there to help you.
[02:13:51.007 --> 02:13:56.734]  When you go into the history of the big factories, the big corporations that create vaccines.
[02:13:57.904 --> 02:14:02.466]  You will find that they are part of the military-industrial complex.
[02:14:02.466 --> 02:14:09.650]  They're on the cutting edge of dealing with killer viruses and killer bacterium, which is part of biowarfare.
[02:14:09.650 --> 02:14:15.333]  They all come out of Cold Springs Harbor and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and the big medical facilities in England.
[02:14:15.333 --> 02:14:20.936]  And you'll see the founding directors and then their sons and everybody else are all public eugenicists.
[02:14:20.936 --> 02:14:23.878]  It's like the IBM Human Genome run from Cold Springs Harbor.
[02:14:24.438 --> 02:14:28.519]  Last year, the director comes out and says blacks aren't humans, basically kill them.
[02:14:28.519 --> 02:14:35.061]  And I'd already put him in Endgame saying he was one of the top technicians coming up with the eugenics op.
[02:14:35.061 --> 02:14:38.182]  But the big secret is a lot of racists go, good, kill the blacks.
[02:14:38.182 --> 02:14:44.584]  What those stupid racists don't understand is the elites are really trying to target Northern Europeans.
[02:14:44.584 --> 02:14:50.946]  And these are Northern Europeans themselves involved in a lot of this because they see Northern Europeans as their potential competition.
[02:14:51.306 --> 02:14:59.311]  Yes, because out of the Northern Europeans, they've always had antagonism, they've always had rebellions, you see.
[02:14:59.311 --> 02:15:05.875]  And there's more individuality by nature, it's inherent in the Northern Europeans.
[02:15:05.875 --> 02:15:08.576]  We're not a collective society as such.
[02:15:08.576 --> 02:15:11.998]  We're not like China, a history of collectivism.
[02:15:11.998 --> 02:15:19.763]  Therefore, in fact, the United Nations has said, and the League of Nations before it said the same thing, their enemy to world order was individualism.
[02:15:20.347 --> 02:15:22.188]  Individualism would have to be eradicated.
[02:15:22.188 --> 02:15:26.789]  But getting back to the laboratories, you look at Baxter Laboratories.
[02:15:26.789 --> 02:15:31.151]  Now, Baxter Laboratories, we've got to remember, was paid by government.
[02:15:31.151 --> 02:15:34.732]  They're combined with the Biowarfare Departments.
[02:15:34.732 --> 02:15:43.896]  They were paid during World War II to come up with different bacterial and biowarfare ingredients, etc.
[02:15:43.896 --> 02:15:49.038]  But they were also part of IG Farben that created the Nazi war machine.
[02:15:49.765 --> 02:15:53.568]  They've always been involved in this kind of thing.
[02:15:53.568 --> 02:15:59.632]  You cannot be involved in dealing with viruses purely to kill them off.
[02:15:59.632 --> 02:16:09.238]  The military's always hand in glove with you, or hand in hand with you, because you're on the cutting edge of evolving these viruses into killers as well.
[02:16:09.238 --> 02:16:12.740]  They're so advanced, they can give you a shot for whatever they tell you it is.
[02:16:12.740 --> 02:16:14.301]  You'll never know what it is.
[02:16:14.301 --> 02:16:16.382]  The guy who gives you the shot can't analyze it.
[02:16:16.382 --> 02:16:17.363]  It's all based on faith.
[02:16:18.337 --> 02:16:24.075]  And they can give you a booster down the road that triggers off the first shot and down you go.
[02:16:24.075 --> 02:16:25.620]  That's how perfect they have it.
[02:16:26.535 --> 02:16:28.776]  That's called a binary weapon.
[02:16:28.776 --> 02:16:30.116]  They actually wrote papers on that.
[02:16:30.116 --> 02:16:47.263]  And as you properly said, and even Dr. Salk bragged about it, when they give you, say, an SV40 cancer that's been engineered, it's designed that at a certain hormone fluctuation in the body, it triggers and then starts the replication attacks in the human body.
[02:16:47.263 --> 02:16:47.863]  That's right.
[02:16:47.863 --> 02:16:52.225]  If your testosterone starts dropping in 30s, well, bang, you're done with the cancer at 35.
[02:16:52.905 --> 02:16:54.806]  Nah, it's good though.
[02:16:54.806 --> 02:16:57.287]  And now we have people at 20 getting their Alzheimer's.
[02:16:57.287 --> 02:16:58.528]  It's normal!
[02:16:58.528 --> 02:16:59.488]  Yeah, isn't that amazing?
[02:16:59.488 --> 02:17:00.869]  It's beautiful, Alan.
[02:17:00.869 --> 02:17:04.190]  Something beautiful is about to happen, like they say in 2001.
[02:17:04.190 --> 02:17:04.751]  That's right.
[02:17:04.751 --> 02:17:05.751]  Something wonderful.
[02:17:05.751 --> 02:17:06.571]  It's beautiful.
[02:17:06.571 --> 02:17:09.353]  Something wonderful.
[02:17:09.353 --> 02:17:10.273]  But that's how it is.
[02:17:10.273 --> 02:17:18.637]  And you've got to understand, as I say, these big international corporations and laboratories are all part of a military-industrial complex.
[02:17:19.398 --> 02:17:35.168]  A book was written after World War II, actually it was written about the 90s, 1990s, by a Toronto Star reporter who got hold of lots of declassified information from the Canadian, US, and British governments that all worked together.
[02:17:35.168 --> 02:17:39.011]  The book is called Deadly Allies, Canada's Secret War.
[02:17:39.011 --> 02:17:42.633]  And those guys, during World War II, and Canada led the field,
[02:17:43.505 --> 02:17:50.669]  They could get a virus, a common virus, turn it into a killer within about an hour in what they call the fast breeder.
[02:17:50.669 --> 02:17:56.051]  They were so far advanced in World War II, and guess who was all on board working with them?
[02:17:56.051 --> 02:18:01.274]  The same big pharma companies that deal with making your inoculations.
[02:18:01.274 --> 02:18:06.457]  And all run by Eugenicist on record, but Alan, shouldn't we just trust them?
[02:18:07.281 --> 02:18:08.281]  That's it.
[02:18:08.281 --> 02:18:10.602]  That's the double thing that folk get into.
[02:18:10.602 --> 02:18:17.185]  They've got all this propaganda on television, mainly through fiction television series.
[02:18:17.185 --> 02:18:22.908]  Yeah, where the backwards, kook, racist, scum, child molester doesn't want to take the shot.
[02:18:22.908 --> 02:18:30.631]  Every TV show, every drama, but then the women always figure out on the show and they make sure the kids get it and then the kids' lives are saved.
[02:18:31.158 --> 02:18:31.838]  That's right.
[02:18:31.838 --> 02:18:33.819]  They know best.
[02:18:33.819 --> 02:18:35.560]  That's why they're going to take the Gardasil.
[02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:36.961]  They're going to show you, Alan.
[02:18:36.961 --> 02:18:38.642]  They're not going to listen to you.
[02:18:38.642 --> 02:18:39.322]  No.
[02:18:39.322 --> 02:18:43.484]  They're with the government.
[02:18:43.484 --> 02:18:44.865]  So that's the key to it.
[02:18:44.865 --> 02:18:47.066]  As you say yourself, the statistics are out there.
[02:18:47.066 --> 02:18:48.447]  We are being sterilized.
[02:18:48.447 --> 02:18:51.289]  We've been getting sterilized for an awful long time.
[02:18:51.289 --> 02:18:59.593]  We know that some of the various culprits that were deliberately put in our food, the bisphenol A and all the rest of it, they even classified melamine
[02:19:00.214 --> 02:19:00.434]  Oh yes!
[02:19:00.434 --> 02:19:01.155]  Exactly!
[02:19:01.155 --> 02:19:08.380]  They admitted it attacks all organs, causes kidney failure, causes cancer, was always listed as deadly.
[02:19:08.380 --> 02:19:10.802]  Now they came out last year and said, you know what?
[02:19:23.351 --> 02:19:25.453]  Melamine's actually good for your child.
[02:19:25.453 --> 02:19:28.955]  Just like they nationwide say mercury's now nutritious, Alan.
[02:19:28.955 --> 02:19:31.978]  You're a crazy... Are you crazy?
[02:19:31.978 --> 02:19:33.159]  You don't like mercury?
[02:19:33.159 --> 02:19:37.402]  Yeah, and they actually put the melamine in baby food.
[02:19:37.402 --> 02:19:41.145]  And they know darn well it sterilizes the male child very early on.
[02:19:42.409 --> 02:19:43.891]  Man, we got a radical on there.
[02:19:43.891 --> 02:19:47.455]  Folks, he's saying melamine, plastic toxin, isn't good for babies.
[02:19:47.455 --> 02:19:48.977]  He's even saying mercury isn't good.
[02:19:48.977 --> 02:19:51.160]  Everybody knows vitamin M's good.
[02:19:51.160 --> 02:19:52.482]  Man, we're radical!
[02:19:52.482 --> 02:19:53.483]  Whoa!
[02:19:53.483 --> 02:19:56.307]  This show is just incredibly kooky.
[02:19:56.307 --> 02:19:57.108]  The government's right.
[02:19:57.108 --> 02:19:58.349]  Mercury's good.
[02:19:58.349 --> 02:19:59.130]  Hell, then what?
[02:19:59.130 --> 02:20:00.091]  Man, you're extreme.
[02:20:01.021 --> 02:20:02.683]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:20:02.683 --> 02:20:03.064]  July 1st, 2009.
[02:20:03.064 --> 02:20:03.905]  Gold open this morning at $939.
[02:20:03.905 --> 02:20:07.229]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $965.94, $482.97 for the half-ounce, or $241.49 for a quarter-ounce.
[02:20:07.229 --> 02:20:07.670]  That's $965.94 for
[02:20:15.981 --> 02:20:16.161]  $3297 and $241.49.
[02:20:36.778 --> 02:20:38.519]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity,
[02:21:04.962 --> 02:21:07.019]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[02:21:07.808 --> 02:21:13.693]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[02:21:13.693 --> 02:21:20.198]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[02:21:20.198 --> 02:21:22.160]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[02:21:22.160 --> 02:21:24.622]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[02:21:24.622 --> 02:21:35.511]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[02:21:37.791 --> 02:21:39.473]  It's not about left or right.
[02:21:39.473 --> 02:21:41.335]  It's about a one world government.
[02:21:41.335 --> 02:21:48.242]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[02:21:48.242 --> 02:21:56.510]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:21:56.510 --> 02:21:58.091]  The Obama Deception.
[02:21:58.091 --> 02:21:59.273]  The people strike back.
[02:22:01.215 --> 02:22:12.122]  What would your life be like if you woke up each morning with new vitality, feeling better than you have in years, and you noticed a difference in your sleeping patterns, blood sugar levels, and had a sense of well-being overall?
[02:22:12.122 --> 02:22:16.305]  There's something that is changing thousands of people's lives, and you could be one of them.
[02:22:16.305 --> 02:22:18.446]  It's called Heart and Body Extract.
[02:22:18.446 --> 02:22:23.910]  Sharon Harris, co-creator of Heart and Body Extract, talks about the positive effects of Heart and Body Extract.
[02:22:24.070 --> 02:22:34.092]  What happens with the formula Heart and Body Extract is it's giving the body the necessary vitamins, minerals, amino acids, enzymes and phytonutrients so the body will heal itself.
[02:22:34.092 --> 02:22:40.594]  And yes, the body does have the ability to balance blood pressure, balance cholesterol, clean and unclog the arteries.
[02:22:40.594 --> 02:22:43.935]  It can also work on balancing the circulation for diabetics.
[02:22:43.935 --> 02:22:45.995]  So the body is an amazing thing.
[02:22:45.995 --> 02:22:48.916]  It simply needs some help so it has the tools to heal itself.
[02:22:49.116 --> 02:22:51.621]  Heart and Body Extract gets results.
[02:22:51.621 --> 02:22:54.947]  To order your 2 month supply, call now, toll free at 866-295-5305.

[02:23:00.996 --> 02:23:10.338]  We have just received news that the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements on back taxes and millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands of dollars.
[02:23:10.338 --> 02:23:23.842]  If any of you out there owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS, we have created an open phone line with American Tax Settlement for all GCN listeners to see if you qualify for a settlement with the IRS to save thousands.
[02:23:23.842 --> 02:23:24.842]  The number to call is 1-800-506-5904.
[02:23:28.263 --> 02:23:32.926]  Millions of taxpayers now may be eligible for this settlement to save thousands of dollars.
[02:23:32.926 --> 02:23:37.889]  Don't risk the IRS coming after you and garnishing your wages or seizing your property.
[02:23:37.889 --> 02:23:46.994]  American Tax Settlement specializes in negotiating with the IRS on your behalf, keeping the IRS off your back and saving consumers millions of dollars.
[02:23:46.994 --> 02:23:51.697]  If you owe $10,000 or more in taxes to the IRS, the number to call is 1-800-506-5904.
[02:23:55.359 --> 02:23:55.840]  That's 1-800-506-5904.
[02:23:55.840 --> 02:23:56.120]  Call today!
[02:24:20.407 --> 02:24:38.756]  You know, I sit here joking around a little bit, hoping that people out there watching this later on YouTube and Google and BlipTV and across the web will, for God's sakes, find out Gardasil's killing a bunch of people to take it and causing autoimmune problems with other women and is clearly a sterilization weapon.
[02:24:40.199 --> 02:24:41.760]  This isn't a game.
[02:24:41.760 --> 02:24:43.120]  Mercury isn't good for you.
[02:24:43.120 --> 02:24:47.562]  They think you're so stupid now that they get on the news and say, your child needs Mercury.
[02:24:47.562 --> 02:24:49.503]  And I've played the news clips here probably a hundred times.
[02:24:49.503 --> 02:24:50.543]  I'm not going to play it today.
[02:24:50.543 --> 02:24:51.424]  You know, they won't believe it.
[02:24:51.424 --> 02:24:52.984]  Cue up Mercury, good for you.
[02:24:52.984 --> 02:24:54.705]  Get me the YouTube.
[02:24:54.705 --> 02:24:57.926]  The point is, I've also got to know when they say lead's good for children.
[02:24:57.926 --> 02:25:00.427]  Lead isn't good for children.
[02:25:00.427 --> 02:25:07.490]  We're going to go to your calls in a moment, but I have just, as a layman studying the psychology, they're trying to shock us.
[02:25:07.490 --> 02:25:09.671]  And I want you to speak to this, and we're going to calls the next segment, Alan.
[02:25:11.206 --> 02:25:15.889]  They're trying to shock us when they say, yes, we're torturing people's children in front of them, but it's to fight Al Qaeda.
[02:25:15.889 --> 02:25:20.052]  And then Jack Bauer does it on the TV show 24, and everybody sits there.
[02:25:20.052 --> 02:25:22.874]  The new hero, the new John Wayne tortures kids.
[02:25:22.874 --> 02:25:25.016]  So it's predictive programming you talk about.
[02:25:25.016 --> 02:25:27.658]  You know, they're modeling a social animals off of this.
[02:25:27.658 --> 02:25:33.161]  They try to shock you saying on CNBC, lead is good for children and it's good for the economy, quote.
[02:25:33.161 --> 02:25:35.123]  Or mercury is good for children, the feds say.
[02:25:35.643 --> 02:25:55.885]  They're trying to make it, or killing Khalid Sheikh Mohammed five or six times before they captured him, or killing Kemal Ali 12 times, and killing all these other guys, Zarqawi 14 times, and then never retracting the last time they killed him, or the CIA openly announcing they're doing a destabilization campaign to stage the election upset.
[02:25:56.585 --> 02:25:59.767]  It literally is an extension of what we heard before, shock and awe.
[02:25:59.767 --> 02:26:00.227]  Shock and awe.
[02:26:25.325 --> 02:26:30.710]  They either use it with the massive bombardment on physical realm or soft bombardment.
[02:26:30.710 --> 02:26:34.014]  We call it soft bombardment through massive propaganda.
[02:26:34.014 --> 02:26:38.678]  We are hit with conflicting messages on the same topics all the time.
[02:26:38.678 --> 02:26:46.026]  And ultimately they know that the public, because they're trained, will always go ultimately with the expert opinion.
[02:26:46.733 --> 02:26:47.054]  I don't
[02:27:01.873 --> 02:27:09.079]  Yeah, it's learned helplessness where the studies with the rats or puppies, where they shock them, where they finally just give up in the corner catatonically.
[02:27:09.079 --> 02:27:09.439]  I agree.
[02:27:09.439 --> 02:27:14.783]  They're just putting up... They're also setting the precedent that they lie and don't get in trouble for it.
[02:27:14.783 --> 02:27:17.205]  They've been doing that for so many years.
[02:27:17.205 --> 02:27:26.612]  I mean, I get a laugh at people actually chanting slogans that they're given by Madison Avenue, like, change is good, without ever asking, what change do you mean?
[02:27:26.612 --> 02:27:27.573]  Define change.
[02:27:27.573 --> 02:27:28.613]  Define the changes.
[02:27:28.613 --> 02:27:29.214]  No one ever did.
[02:27:30.598 --> 02:27:31.578]  No one ever did.
[02:27:31.578 --> 02:27:36.240]  And Lenin said, we shall win by slogans, the use of slogans.
[02:27:36.240 --> 02:27:37.400]  And it works.
[02:27:37.400 --> 02:27:38.020]  It really works.
[02:27:38.020 --> 02:27:39.540]  Because people don't ask.
[02:27:39.540 --> 02:27:41.941]  They don't ask beyond the slogan.
[02:27:41.941 --> 02:27:44.742]  It's like Orwell's, an animal farm.
[02:27:44.742 --> 02:27:49.083]  The sheep who are taught the slogan that four legs are good, two legs are bad.
[02:27:49.730 --> 02:27:50.111]  Well, exactly.
[02:27:50.111 --> 02:27:50.631]  First they go from...
[02:28:04.875 --> 02:28:18.879]  Four legs good, two legs bad, to four legs good, two legs also good, to four legs good, two legs better, to two legs good, four legs bad.
[02:28:18.879 --> 02:28:19.799]  That's right.
[02:28:19.799 --> 02:28:20.239]  That's right.
[02:28:20.239 --> 02:28:27.541]  And so they're still chanting what sounds to them to be the same thing, and they don't particularly even analyze what they're saying themselves.
[02:28:27.541 --> 02:28:33.763]  And meanwhile, with repetition, they're actually convincing themselves of the truth.
[02:28:35.663 --> 02:28:37.325]  Well, I was watching HBO this morning.
[02:28:37.325 --> 02:28:39.167]  I forgot the name of the documentary about free speech.
[02:28:39.167 --> 02:28:41.909]  They've been hyping it big time, but I'm on the treadmill watching it.
[02:28:41.909 --> 02:28:43.271]  And it was all about liberals.
[02:28:43.271 --> 02:28:48.055]  We love free speech, but the evil right-wingers are trying to take everybody's speech.
[02:28:48.055 --> 02:28:59.126]  That made it a left-right issue, when meanwhile it's the left that just passed through the House a hate crimes bill that will completely ban free speech in America, saying if something you said hurts somebody's feelings, it's a federal felony.
[02:28:59.867 --> 02:29:05.411]  And then, meanwhile, it makes it all about how the right wing wants your free speech, so we've got to take theirs.
[02:29:05.411 --> 02:29:08.034]  Again, it's just all complete crap.
[02:29:08.034 --> 02:29:08.854]  It is.
[02:29:08.854 --> 02:29:17.461]  You are seeing, really, a perfected technique that was tested and improved under the Soviet system.
[02:29:17.461 --> 02:29:21.324]  And I've mentioned so many times that the re-estimation with Senator Norman Dodd
[02:29:22.388 --> 02:29:32.853]  Did you find out in the 1950s, when they investigated the tax-free foundations that evicted Rockefeller and Ford Carnegie, their job was to unite the Soviet system with that of the West.
[02:29:32.853 --> 02:29:37.095]  We're seeing Soviet techniques now introduced in the West, and they're perfected.
[02:29:37.095 --> 02:29:39.596]  They have been perfected.
[02:29:39.596 --> 02:29:40.616]  Stay there, Alan Watt.
[02:29:40.616 --> 02:29:44.598]  We'll be right back on the other side with phone calls and a lot more.
[02:29:44.598 --> 02:29:49.020]  Cousins of the Matrix dot com, InfoWars dot com, PrisonPlanet dot TV.
[02:29:49.020 --> 02:29:50.281]  More straight ahead.
[02:29:50.281 --> 02:29:50.901]  Take your mercury.
[02:29:51.621 --> 02:29:55.544]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.544 --> 02:30:00.828]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.828 --> 02:30:06.692]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years.
[02:30:06.692 --> 02:30:07.993]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[02:30:07.993 --> 02:30:12.256]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[02:30:12.256 --> 02:30:14.117]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[02:30:14.117 --> 02:30:20.441]  And now, the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[02:30:21.562 --> 02:30:24.423]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[02:30:24.423 --> 02:30:26.164]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[02:30:26.164 --> 02:30:29.165]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[02:30:29.165 --> 02:30:30.886]  And their formula really works.
[02:30:30.886 --> 02:30:33.707]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[02:30:33.707 --> 02:30:35.188]  Try the NutriCafe.
[02:30:35.188 --> 02:30:39.950]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[02:30:39.950 --> 02:30:42.371]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[02:30:42.371 --> 02:30:44.832]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[02:30:44.832 --> 02:30:46.933]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[02:30:46.933 --> 02:30:48.514]  Go to www.
[02:30:49.955 --> 02:30:52.278]  We're good to go.
[02:31:00.953 --> 02:31:06.158]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[02:31:06.158 --> 02:31:10.182]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:10.182 --> 02:31:16.088]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:16.088 --> 02:31:21.153]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:21.153 --> 02:31:21.654]  Number three,
[02:31:22.054 --> 02:31:28.358]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[02:31:28.358 --> 02:31:31.260]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[02:31:31.260 --> 02:31:35.782]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:35.782 --> 02:31:39.625]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[02:31:39.625 --> 02:31:45.368]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a long-time sponsor of ours.
[02:31:45.368 --> 02:31:48.490]  You can get more information at www.solutionsfromscience.com.
[02:31:48.510 --> 02:31:50.052]  MySolarBackup.com.
[02:31:50.052 --> 02:31:51.835]  That's MySolarBackup.com.
[02:31:51.835 --> 02:31:54.399]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[02:31:54.399 --> 02:31:57.044]  So go to MySolarBackup.com or call toll free 877-327-0365.
[02:32:00.575 --> 02:32:01.956]  This is Alex Jones.
[02:32:01.956 --> 02:32:03.957]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[02:32:03.957 --> 02:32:04.937]  Well, you should.
[02:32:04.937 --> 02:32:09.420]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[02:32:09.420 --> 02:32:10.220]  That's right.
[02:32:10.220 --> 02:32:20.245]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[02:32:20.245 --> 02:32:25.648]  Plus, if you act fast, the Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol
[02:32:25.888 --> 02:32:34.470]  In the caliber of your choice, I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[02:32:34.470 --> 02:32:39.991]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[02:32:39.991 --> 02:32:41.451]  This is real.
[02:32:41.451 --> 02:32:42.511]  Don't miss out.
[02:32:42.511 --> 02:32:51.073]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar and get your free handgun.

[02:33:00.117 --> 02:33:08.501]  I hear the train a comin'.
[02:33:08.501 --> 02:33:10.742]  It's rollin' around the bend.
[02:33:10.742 --> 02:33:15.064]  And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when.
[02:33:15.064 --> 02:33:17.886]  I'm stuck in Folsom Prison.
[02:33:17.886 --> 02:33:19.667]  And time keeps draggin' on.
[02:33:23.746 --> 02:33:37.429]  That's called the Mopac Express and that railway runs right by my office, right down to San Antonio.
[02:33:37.429 --> 02:33:42.230]  The very railroad Johnny Cash is talking about.
[02:33:42.230 --> 02:33:44.490]  Just to watch him die.
[02:33:44.490 --> 02:33:48.691]  I hang my head.
[02:33:53.973 --> 02:33:59.456]  Going back to Alan Watt, your phone call is usually 20 minutes to the next hour, then I'll blitz through news and information.
[02:33:59.456 --> 02:34:02.657]  I want to talk about some solutions with him, too, coming up in the next hour.
[02:34:02.657 --> 02:34:06.920]  Let's talk to Frank in New York and Chuck, Mark, Matty, Dave, and others.
[02:34:06.920 --> 02:34:08.500]  Please be quick, I want to take a lot of calls.
[02:34:08.500 --> 02:34:10.081]  Frank, you're on the air.
[02:34:10.081 --> 02:34:22.147]  Good afternoon, Alex, and Alan, I wanted to just comment briefly on the show that I heard this morning, I guess rebroadcasted from yesterday.
[02:34:22.147 --> 02:34:23.008]  It was excellent.
[02:34:23.607 --> 02:34:38.277]  And I was so pleased to hear the young people now, through the videos and documentaries, becoming critical in their analysis of the political discourse and the economic discourse that's affecting everyone's lives.
[02:34:38.277 --> 02:34:49.604]  The reason why I called Alan, and Alex, I think you may find this interesting as well, I just have been spending the last two days reading the Bank of International Settlements annual report.
[02:34:50.692 --> 02:35:19.737]  uh... for uh... this year called rescue recovery and reform the narrow path ahead and it's rather interesting uh... because i had heard the uh... conversation i guess on monday regarding the person that was uh... paying his bill with the uh... special rights uh... drawing instruments and uh... i found it very interesting because in the annual report the ratio of the u s dollar
[02:35:20.546 --> 02:35:32.612]  To the SDR is 1.5 and I think the what your guest had said regarding his transaction was of 3.1.
[02:35:34.451 --> 02:35:38.813]  So apparently it can be floated at the discretion of the bank, which is rather interesting.
[02:35:38.813 --> 02:35:39.493]  No, no.
[02:35:39.493 --> 02:35:53.860]  This gives them, for those that don't know, a financial fiat currency for bank-to-bank, government-to-government, institution-to-institution, kind of Fortune 100, between themselves, and then we're all down here with these regional currencies that I also manipulate.
[02:35:54.660 --> 02:35:58.542]  As part of their insider trading, a completely rigged game.
[02:35:58.542 --> 02:36:03.484]  And you notice that code word, the narrow path ahead, meaning dictatorial.
[02:36:03.484 --> 02:36:13.508]  They're going to hold everybody by the scruff of the neck, including a lot of the rich, who've got to do exactly what they say if you want any hope of ever having a recovery, which won't lead to a recovery.
[02:36:13.508 --> 02:36:22.212]  It'll just be a stagnation and a new lower plateau of standard of living, then to another plateau as they manage our slide downward
[02:36:23.152 --> 02:36:26.135]  In their own words, because we're too greedy and live too well.
[02:36:26.135 --> 02:36:33.742]  I think that they would discuss the financial derivatives fiasco in the annual report, but they didn't.
[02:36:33.742 --> 02:36:44.632]  However, they did issue a statement on May 18th, stating that up until December of last year, there were about $584 trillion worth of derivatives worldwide, which
[02:36:48.084 --> 02:36:59.407]  It appears to be very small, considering it's about 1.4 quadrillion, at least according to the figures coming from the econometric institutions here in the United States and Europe.
[02:36:59.407 --> 02:37:02.588]  So it's a rather interesting discrepancy there.
[02:37:02.588 --> 02:37:09.470]  But I wonder... But that's kind of like a black hole the size of the Milky Way, or a black hole the size of the solar system.
[02:37:09.470 --> 02:37:11.771]  If it's right up on you, it's going to gobble you up.
[02:37:12.566 --> 02:37:17.348]  Or they may reappear six months from now, and more bailouts will be needed worldwide.
[02:37:17.348 --> 02:37:18.748]  No, no, they're already saying that.
[02:37:18.748 --> 02:37:20.669]  Do you have a question for Alan Watt?
[02:37:20.669 --> 02:37:25.371]  Yeah, I just wanted to mention, Alan, that what you said is nothing new to me.
[02:37:25.371 --> 02:37:36.434]  However, the model that Foucault talked about, using Jeremy Benton's metaphor, the prison panopticon, seems to be here with the technology.
[02:37:36.434 --> 02:37:37.375]  And the sad thing is,
[02:37:38.243 --> 02:37:43.609]  That many of these modalities were discussed 60, 70 years ago.
[02:37:43.609 --> 02:38:00.887]  I was thinking of Harold Blaswell's National Security State concept in a book that was written 1939 to 1940, where he really outlawed a complete Western, sort of Soviet-style kind of national security state with violations of
[02:38:01.637 --> 02:38:03.478]  Uh, accepted freedoms and constitutional security.
[02:38:03.478 --> 02:38:03.978]  Yeah, that's right.
[02:38:03.978 --> 02:38:09.299]  They used the threat to national security, then they built the shadow government around that.
[02:38:09.299 --> 02:38:12.100]  Now it's, it created this parallel government.
[02:38:12.100 --> 02:38:17.901]  Now the parallel shadow government is coming out in the open and absorbing what's left.
[02:38:17.901 --> 02:38:19.842]  They've, you know, kind of like putting an egg in vinegar.
[02:38:19.842 --> 02:38:28.404]  They've been dissolving our shell, turning our skeleton into rubber, so they can more easily, like a demonic pelican, force us into their maw.
[02:38:28.404 --> 02:38:29.225]  Uh, thank you for the call.
[02:38:29.225 --> 02:38:30.565]  Let's get Alan Watts' comment on that.
[02:38:31.263 --> 02:38:37.688]  Yeah, and also, too, there's another technique involved, written back about 1914.
[02:38:37.688 --> 02:38:38.508]  And H.G.
[02:38:38.508 --> 02:38:51.077]  Wells, who was an official propagandist for the Cecil Rhodes Foundation and the Fabian Society, two big players, backed by the Astor family and their billions, he called it the world brain.
[02:38:51.077 --> 02:38:55.440]  He said eventually all information will be controlled by a world brain.
[02:38:56.084 --> 02:39:03.827]  And this information would develop a brand new world culture, which would be under the control, of course, of those fittest to rule it.
[02:39:03.827 --> 02:39:07.428]  He's talking about supercomputers and so on.
[02:39:07.428 --> 02:39:18.532]  And they were talking in the 20s about putting drugs and things in the water, specifically fluoride, diet, injections, and injunctions, to turn us into gibbering slaves, and they've done an excellent job.
[02:39:18.532 --> 02:39:23.734]  Yeah, and Julian Huxley, the first CEO of UNESCO, also advised to use this technique.
[02:39:24.440 --> 02:39:27.143]  I had a Wall Street Journal writer here the other day.
[02:39:50.191 --> 02:39:52.052]  She was definitely on the prowl.
[02:39:52.052 --> 02:39:57.995]  I hope it's somewhat of a fair piece, but I doubt it, but I'm not going to, I'm not going to cower from it.
[02:39:57.995 --> 02:40:02.136]  Though I just may not have time for more stuff like that in the future.
[02:40:02.136 --> 02:40:06.378]  And I explained to her, I said, you know, sodium fluoride causes brain damage and bone cancer.
[02:40:06.378 --> 02:40:08.079]  And I was printing her mainstream articles.
[02:40:08.079 --> 02:40:09.020]  She goes, no, I know that.
[02:40:09.020 --> 02:40:11.221]  But she said the elite have to drink it too.
[02:40:11.221 --> 02:40:12.001]  Like it was okay.
[02:40:12.001 --> 02:40:14.002]  And I said, well, if it's so bad, why do they do it?
[02:40:14.918 --> 02:40:17.420]  And she's like, and like, didn't compute.
[02:40:17.420 --> 02:40:19.501]  She said, yeah, but they have to do it too.
[02:40:19.501 --> 02:40:20.522]  And I said, no, they don't.
[02:40:20.522 --> 02:40:26.045]  When Jay Rockefeller was here in town, I did a radio show at a station years ago.
[02:40:26.045 --> 02:40:27.907]  This was about 12 years ago.
[02:40:27.907 --> 02:40:33.110]  And the other guy had a, well, he owned a marina, big marina.
[02:40:33.110 --> 02:40:35.592]  And he also owned a bunch of boats you could charter.
[02:40:35.592 --> 02:40:41.236]  Big, you know, I mean, big for Lake Travis, yachts, you know, things of the whole like 50, 60 people, really nice.
[02:40:41.236 --> 02:40:44.278]  And he would take rich people out and captain it.
[02:40:45.308 --> 02:40:49.309]  And Tim Bluth wanted to scuba dive at the right time of the year in the Rock Bottom Lake.
[02:40:49.309 --> 02:40:52.410]  It's really a Colorado River canyon they filled.
[02:40:52.410 --> 02:40:53.530]  It's a 37-mile-long lake.
[02:40:53.530 --> 02:40:58.571]  But long story short here, I started dreaming about being on the lake, and then I've been on the lake in two years.
[02:40:58.571 --> 02:40:59.571]  I'm so busy.
[02:40:59.571 --> 02:41:00.271]  Literally!
[02:41:00.271 --> 02:41:01.291]  Two years!
[02:41:01.291 --> 02:41:01.672]  I love it.
[02:41:01.672 --> 02:41:02.392]  I think about it every day.
[02:41:02.392 --> 02:41:12.794]  But the issue is Jay Rockefeller was down here for two days with the SOS people surveying tens of thousands of acres they'd stolen through watershed rules.
[02:41:14.526 --> 02:41:21.111]  And he was captaining the boat with some of the servants and people feeding him and all this stuff.
[02:41:21.111 --> 02:41:25.475]  And he also did trips with people down to the Caribbean, but that's a separate issue.
[02:41:25.475 --> 02:41:38.405]  And he said he sat there watching, and they had caviar and food for everybody, but Jay Rockefeller and a few of his assistants, they had ice chests with their own food, their own servants, their own wine, their own bottled water.
[02:41:39.888 --> 02:41:44.551]  And by the way, it was a certain brand of Arkansas water that I later saw one of my friends was drinking.
[02:41:44.551 --> 02:41:46.012]  I found all the Hollywood folks drink it.
[02:41:46.012 --> 02:41:49.214]  It's the same of that green bottle of water I got around here sometimes.
[02:41:49.214 --> 02:41:53.196]  Point is, he had that, a Mountain Valley.
[02:41:53.196 --> 02:41:54.177]  A Mountain Valley, right?
[02:41:54.177 --> 02:41:55.697]  Mountain Valley Spring?
[02:41:55.697 --> 02:41:57.799]  And he had all these little packaged
[02:41:58.635 --> 02:41:59.115]  Yeah, yeah.
[02:42:15.307 --> 02:42:20.508]  Yes, and there's an article in a British newspaper, Prince Charles, too, had over, I think, 80 to 100 farms, tenant farmers worked on them.
[02:42:20.508 --> 02:42:22.428]  Again, massive herds of Angus beef.
[02:42:46.083 --> 02:42:51.786]  Lots of, thousands and thousands of acres of naturally grown corn, etc.
[02:42:51.786 --> 02:42:54.167]  Everything that you need.
[02:42:54.167 --> 02:42:56.968]  They do not need, they don't eat what we eat.
[02:42:56.968 --> 02:42:57.869]  There's no way.
[02:42:57.869 --> 02:42:59.489]  Plus, here's another thing too.
[02:42:59.489 --> 02:43:09.354]  Most people don't realize that these very important people already believe that we are so contaminated with different diseases.
[02:43:09.354 --> 02:43:13.856]  And this was in the newspaper in Canada about two or three years ago.
[02:43:14.600 --> 02:43:17.604]  It came out when the Prime Minister of Canada was going abroad.
[02:43:17.604 --> 02:43:27.115]  All prime ministers and high-level bureaucrats and important people carry at least two pints of their own blood, refrigerated blood, with them wherever they go.
[02:43:27.546 --> 02:43:33.068]  That was in USA Today that Al Gore has a whole refrigerator of blood that follows him.
[02:43:33.068 --> 02:43:39.811]  That's right, because they believe they've already been successful in infecting us all with different kinds of things.
[02:43:39.811 --> 02:43:46.293]  They will not risk getting a transfusion from us, and the standard procedure has been for the last at least 15 years.
[02:43:47.210 --> 02:44:01.544]  Well that ties into Bayer, knowingly for over a decade, over a million doses, just in one case, of Factor VIII, knowing it all had HIV and Hepatitis, and their own documents came out, even MSNBC reported it like it was no big deal, knowing they were going to kill everybody!
[02:44:01.544 --> 02:44:03.766]  And they said, oh well Bayer was just greedy, didn't care.
[02:44:03.766 --> 02:44:04.306]  No!
[02:44:04.306 --> 02:44:06.308]  This was a religious sacrament!
[02:44:06.308 --> 02:44:10.212]  This was a murder operation, lovingly carried out!
[02:44:10.212 --> 02:44:10.372]  Yes.
[02:44:11.161 --> 02:44:15.763]  That's right, and so the public have no idea how far ahead these characters are.
[02:44:15.763 --> 02:44:20.224]  I've even been asked about the spraying, and how can these guys be breathing the same air as we?
[02:44:20.224 --> 02:44:32.789]  Well, most of the time these guys are in their air-conditioned, filtered limos, or in their air-conditioned, filtered homes, but they also, and someone sent me this thing, there's actually a collation device that goes in your vein.
[02:44:33.470 --> 02:44:33.850]  I think so.
[02:44:48.533 --> 02:44:55.439]  Well, I want to add, there's certain areas they don't spray, like white fishing areas, where they stay most of the year now, where they're not chemtrailing.
[02:44:55.439 --> 02:44:56.921]  And I wanted to bring that up.
[02:44:56.921 --> 02:45:00.684]  They have admitted they've been chemtrailing since the mid-90s.
[02:45:00.684 --> 02:45:02.225]  They got a Nobel Prize in 92 for it.
[02:45:02.225 --> 02:45:03.747]  I'm making a separate film on that.
[02:45:07.051 --> 02:45:11.573]  We always said it's barium salts, it's aluminum dioxide, it's terraforming, but also toxic.
[02:45:11.573 --> 02:45:14.915]  They love multifaceted things that do, you know, that cover multiple bases.
[02:45:14.915 --> 02:45:19.197]  They love grand slams where they get to carry out multiple evils at the same time and consolidate power.
[02:45:20.840 --> 02:45:38.707]  And now they've just come out in USA Today and Associated Press and Reuters and here it is, Wall Street Journal two weeks ago, it's time to cool the planet, with Kim trailing terraforming and the ingredients they list is exactly what private scientists studied it and said it was.
[02:45:38.707 --> 02:45:41.769]  And then they go, oh yes, that was all just testing.
[02:45:41.769 --> 02:45:44.890]  Now we're going to start the real operation.
[02:45:44.890 --> 02:45:48.792]  The Earth's 20% darker and all the climatologists I interview say that
[02:45:50.689 --> 02:45:53.790]  Looking at what they're spraying is actually heating the earth.
[02:45:53.790 --> 02:45:57.972]  So are they trying to cause more... I mean, we know they have weather weapons.
[02:45:57.972 --> 02:46:03.115]  I broke the father of weather weapons, Ben Livingston, here on air, what they were doing with it 50 years ago.
[02:46:03.115 --> 02:46:05.036]  They could control hurricanes in the late 60s.
[02:46:05.036 --> 02:46:07.197]  Stanford Research Institute certified.
[02:46:07.197 --> 02:46:13.100]  But are they planning to engineer bigger calamities and droughts and then say, oh, see, we've got to save you?
[02:46:13.100 --> 02:46:15.661]  But then cover it saying they're trying to fix it?
[02:46:15.661 --> 02:46:17.802]  Because we've exposed the chemtrails, now they've got to admit it.
[02:46:17.802 --> 02:46:18.042]  Go ahead.
[02:46:18.642 --> 02:46:32.265]  Yeah, in the 1970s, I think, 78, all the major countries, United States, Britain, Canada, and so on, all signed an international agreement, a treaty at the United Nations, on weather warfare.
[02:46:32.265 --> 02:46:34.805]  And people can go into it and check it out for themselves.
[02:46:34.805 --> 02:46:37.005]  In there, it tells you what they could do then.
[02:46:37.005 --> 02:46:45.027]  They could create earthquakes, droughts, floods, famines, and so on, all just with the HAARP technology and the spraying alone, in conjunction.
[02:46:45.717 --> 02:46:54.345]  And Secretary of Defense Cohen, 1997, April 27th issue of Army Times, said the exact same thing.
[02:46:54.345 --> 02:46:56.347]  In fact, people don't believe it.
[02:46:56.347 --> 02:46:59.990]  Secretary of Defense William Cohen, Army Times,
[02:47:00.971 --> 02:47:02.292]  Weather weapons.
[02:47:02.292 --> 02:47:06.874]  Or Secretary of Defense William Cohen, Army times earthquakes.
[02:47:06.874 --> 02:47:07.634]  That'll pull it up too.
[02:47:07.634 --> 02:47:08.455]  Go ahead, Alan.
[02:47:08.455 --> 02:47:16.299]  And so what they can do so simply now, because it's all technology, it's well tried and tested, and they have given droughts over the years to farming areas.
[02:47:16.299 --> 02:47:20.861]  They put lots of farmers out in Canada and the States either with droughts or floods.
[02:47:20.861 --> 02:47:21.722]  All at the same time.
[02:47:21.722 --> 02:47:26.504]  We always had the same flood in the breadbasket of Canada as you were having in the breadbasket of the U.S.
[02:47:27.003 --> 02:47:28.924]  And we're getting drugs at the same time.
[02:47:28.924 --> 02:47:31.805]  So this is coordinated to bring down the food supply.
[02:47:31.805 --> 02:47:39.208]  But they will convince the public with odd acts of weather warfare that we are, as nature, rebelling.
[02:47:39.208 --> 02:47:40.568]  That's what they'll tell us all.
[02:47:40.568 --> 02:47:49.211]  They won't tell... They can stand there and whistle in the wind and pretend they've got nothing to do with it because they'll never admit they're actually using it to terrify the public.
[02:47:49.211 --> 02:47:53.893]  And then the public will be more compliant and give up even more rights and allow them
[02:47:55.046 --> 02:47:57.487]  Well, it's just like the New World Order.
[02:47:57.487 --> 02:48:00.988]  All these decades, we had their documents, their statements, their videos, their books.
[02:48:00.988 --> 02:48:02.488]  We'd go, look, they're saying it!
[02:48:02.488 --> 02:48:06.849]  And the public would say, that's fake video of David Rockefeller.
[02:48:06.849 --> 02:48:08.850]  The Rothschild family doesn't exist.
[02:48:08.850 --> 02:48:10.310]  I remember hearing that 15 years ago.
[02:48:10.310 --> 02:48:12.051]  That they didn't exist.
[02:48:12.051 --> 02:48:13.451]  That the CFR didn't exist.
[02:48:13.451 --> 02:48:15.231]  Now they say, oh, it exists.
[02:48:15.231 --> 02:48:20.133]  We need a world government to keep us safe.
[02:48:21.494 --> 02:48:22.937]  And it's the same thing now.
[02:48:22.937 --> 02:48:24.119]  There's no chemtrails.
[02:48:24.119 --> 02:48:25.641]  They're not manipulating the weather.
[02:48:25.641 --> 02:48:30.730]  Trails have always hung there for hours at 2,000 feet.
[02:48:30.730 --> 02:48:32.553]  And then now they go, oh, we're spraying you.
[02:48:32.553 --> 02:48:33.435]  Yeah, it's good.
[02:48:34.713 --> 02:48:34.913]  Yeah.
[02:48:34.913 --> 02:48:43.059]  And as they say it too, they tell us that it could have drastic consequences if they were to go ahead and spray, meaning on human health.
[02:48:43.059 --> 02:48:47.201]  That's why when they started at 9 to 8 they couldn't tell the public what they were doing.
[02:48:47.201 --> 02:48:51.745]  They already know the catastrophic effects it's had on people's health with asthma.
[02:48:51.745 --> 02:48:54.366]  People at 40, 50 get diagnosed with asthma.
[02:48:54.366 --> 02:48:58.089]  People dying of bronchial diseases, they can't get rid of the cough.
[02:48:58.089 --> 02:48:58.369]  They have
[02:49:00.205 --> 02:49:02.406]  They have the pulse on the people all the time.
[02:49:02.406 --> 02:49:06.548]  They have all the data coming in from hospitals all the time, daily.
[02:49:06.548 --> 02:49:11.650]  And they know the effects it's been having and what it's doing to the people.
[02:49:11.650 --> 02:49:15.472]  Yeah, here is FAS.orgnews.usa.
[02:49:15.472 --> 02:49:17.973]  You can also go to the Army website.
[02:49:17.973 --> 02:49:19.494]  And here he is.
[02:49:19.494 --> 02:49:24.256]  You guys just had it on screen with a control F. You can read it right there where he talks about
[02:49:26.348 --> 02:49:41.006]  He says he quotes Alvin and Heidi Toffler has written about this in terms of some scientists in their laboratories trying to devise certain types of pathogens that would be ethnic specific so they would just eliminate certain ethnic groups and races and others are designing
[02:49:41.767 --> 02:49:45.570]  Some sort of engineering, some sort of insects that can destroy specific crops.
[02:49:45.570 --> 02:49:55.037]  Others are engaging even in an eco-type of terrorism whereby they can alter the climate, shut off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely, through the use of electromagnetic waves.
[02:49:55.037 --> 02:49:58.559]  That's the Army Times in April of 1997.
[02:49:58.559 --> 02:50:00.921]  You can go to the top and show folks.
[02:50:00.921 --> 02:50:02.162]  But the issue here is
[02:50:03.573 --> 02:50:18.494]  That they, now in September 20th, 2000, Rebuilding America's Defense, as written by Dick Cheney, he says, we need to prepare the public with the media to accept race-specific bioweapons.
[02:50:19.275 --> 02:50:25.158]  And that it's good, and even the Austin American Statesman wrote an article saying, you know, is Dick Cheney right?
[02:50:25.158 --> 02:50:26.839]  Should we kill certain races?
[02:50:26.839 --> 02:50:38.325]  So, if you call somebody a racial term, the media cries, you get arrested, oh we love you so much black people, but then it's like, should we kill all the blacks?
[02:50:38.325 --> 02:50:42.187]  You know, it's loving Oprah's at the meeting, I mean...
[02:50:43.439 --> 02:50:45.880]  See, so it's like, oh, I'm a liberal.
[02:50:45.880 --> 02:50:47.460]  I'm Margaret Sanger.
[02:50:47.460 --> 02:50:48.761]  You're subhuman.
[02:50:48.761 --> 02:50:51.241]  I only want to kill you for the Earth.
[02:50:51.241 --> 02:50:52.062]  You know, I love you.
[02:50:52.062 --> 02:50:53.622]  I'm sorry we have to kill you.
[02:50:53.622 --> 02:50:56.623]  Don't be racist.
[02:50:56.623 --> 02:50:58.343]  Again, if you're against the world order, you're racist.
[02:50:58.343 --> 02:50:59.424]  You're against killing everyone.
[02:50:59.424 --> 02:51:01.504]  You're racist.
[02:51:01.504 --> 02:51:06.846]  You've probably heard about the incredible, powerful and natural antioxidants found in red wine.
[02:51:06.846 --> 02:51:10.867]  Unfortunately, not everyone is able to drink a glass of wine each day.
[02:51:11.317 --> 02:51:12.138]  I'm good to go.
[02:51:33.951 --> 02:51:42.493]  New Rev has been the subject of some of the most exciting anti-aging research in decades and has only recently become available in purified form.
[02:51:42.493 --> 02:51:46.753]  Now, you can discover the amazing health benefits of New Rev for free.
[02:51:46.753 --> 02:51:48.734]  Just pay to have New Rev shipped to you.
[02:51:48.734 --> 02:51:52.855]  Get your free sample now at NewRevOnline.com.
[02:51:52.855 --> 02:51:56.495]  That's N-U-R-E-V Online dot com.
[02:51:56.495 --> 02:51:58.736]  NewRevOnline.com.
[02:51:58.736 --> 02:52:00.276]  Improve your life today.
[02:52:00.996 --> 02:52:02.517]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.
[02:52:02.517 --> 02:52:07.902]  I'm sending out a special alert to all those out there listening with credit card debt and struggling to make payments.
[02:52:07.902 --> 02:52:10.324]  I'm going to give you a very important phone number.
[02:52:10.324 --> 02:52:19.511]  Due to a declining economy and credit crisis, you now have the power to settle your debt and lower your payments by up to 60% or more by calling the bailout group.
[02:52:19.791 --> 02:52:26.877]  This program has already settled over $100,000,000 of debt and are saving individual consumers thousands of dollars.
[02:52:26.877 --> 02:52:33.202]  Folks, if you are struggling with credit card debt and those excessive interest payments, the time is now to take advantage of this opportunity.
[02:52:33.202 --> 02:52:34.844]  Call the bailout group today at 1-800-324.
[02:52:36.625 --> 02:52:37.346]  We're good to go.
[02:53:01.209 --> 02:53:04.652]  Silver is mankind's oldest natural antibiotic.
[02:53:04.652 --> 02:53:08.896]  This very special mineral has been used for centuries by most cultures throughout the world.
[02:53:08.896 --> 02:53:20.567]  Utopia, Texas is home to a small but mighty supplement company called Utopia Silver, who offers colloidal products produced in distilled water without use of animal protein, nitrates, or saline solutions.
[02:53:20.567 --> 02:53:26.132]  Because our colloidal silver is made up of nano-sized particles, it can be better utilized at the cellular level.
[02:53:26.152 --> 02:53:26.712]  I think so.
[02:53:47.697 --> 02:53:55.120]  Visit us today at utopiasilver.com, that's U-T-O-P-I-A silver dot com, or call 888-213-4338, 888-213-4338, and help us win this battle!
[02:54:22.737 --> 02:54:23.817]  Alan Watts, our guest.
[02:54:23.817 --> 02:54:26.779]  I want to blitz through some news with him coming up, but let's go back to your phone calls.
[02:54:26.779 --> 02:54:28.219]  He's going to be with us into the next hour.
[02:54:28.219 --> 02:54:32.221]  His website's CuttingToTheMatrix.com.
[02:54:32.221 --> 02:54:34.362]  Our sites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:54:34.362 --> 02:54:37.423]  All right, I'm going to try to move quickly now.
[02:54:37.423 --> 02:54:39.124]  I had one caller on for like five minutes.
[02:54:39.124 --> 02:54:40.084]  Mark in Oregon.
[02:54:40.084 --> 02:54:40.565]  You're on the air.
[02:54:40.565 --> 02:54:43.626]  Go ahead.
[02:54:43.626 --> 02:54:44.386]  Hello, gentlemen.
[02:54:44.386 --> 02:54:46.427]  Go ahead, Mark.
[02:54:46.427 --> 02:54:48.528]  Yeah, how are you doing, Alex?
[02:54:48.528 --> 02:54:48.728]  Fine.
[02:54:49.892 --> 02:54:50.352]  What's on your mind?
[02:54:50.352 --> 02:55:02.703]  Alex, I notice you're both, and I'm not being destructively critical here, but I'm being constructively critical because the hour is getting extremely late here, okay?
[02:55:02.703 --> 02:55:15.175]  And if you don't realize that fully, then you'll continue on making movies and trying to write a book, and they will have us down to about two months now from as we speak to get us all sick and die.
[02:55:16.324 --> 02:55:20.905]  And, uh, you're really... No, I'm... Listen, this is an incremental... You're long on... Hold on a second.
[02:55:20.905 --> 02:55:21.545]  Hold on a minute.
[02:55:21.545 --> 02:55:24.546]  I think you called a few months ago saying evacuate over the flu.
[02:55:24.546 --> 02:55:26.467]  This is all drills.
[02:55:26.467 --> 02:55:28.687]  And they incrementally ratchet things up.
[02:55:28.687 --> 02:55:30.968]  I don't think everything's going to collapse in two months, but go ahead.
[02:55:30.968 --> 02:55:43.511]  I like to think that you're right, Alex, and I hope that you are, but I don't think we can even begin to assume that when we've got a much worse one coming along, according to Janet Napolitano, in about two months.
[02:55:43.511 --> 02:55:45.032]  Alex... Well, I hope you're wrong.
[02:55:46.098 --> 02:55:53.221]  I hope you're wrong, but yes, they are acting like they're going to drop something big in the next two or three months, and all I can do is do the best job I can.
[02:55:53.221 --> 02:56:03.684]  I don't have all the answers, and I sure would like to run off to the Caribbean with my family, but I'm not doing that, and so I don't really know what the... I mean, I understand your question, though.
[02:56:03.684 --> 02:56:05.505]  You're saying... Well, I mean, finish your statement.
[02:56:05.505 --> 02:56:07.266]  I want to get Alan Watts' take on it.
[02:56:07.266 --> 02:56:08.146]  Okay.
[02:56:08.146 --> 02:56:12.848]  Well, Alex, the point of my call is that it's been long on knowledge and solutions to
[02:56:13.777 --> 02:56:17.320]  Or rather, knowledge and information to expose the evil.
[02:56:17.320 --> 02:56:19.201]  That has not slowed it down one bit.
[02:56:19.201 --> 02:56:23.244]  I've been watching it since 1978 when I learned of the Illuminati.
[02:56:23.244 --> 02:56:24.985]  I've been studying their moves.
[02:56:24.985 --> 02:56:30.489]  I've seen the progress that they have made in the implementation of their plan to kill us all.
[02:56:30.489 --> 02:56:35.252]  And that plan is coming up very soon to its end of the endgame point.
[02:56:35.252 --> 02:56:36.894]  You can go out into the world.
[02:56:36.894 --> 02:56:38.375]  Alan Walk can go out into the world.
[02:56:38.375 --> 02:56:40.236]  Dr. Stan Monteith can go out into the world.
[02:56:40.638 --> 02:56:43.640]  So can Pastor Butch Paul and several other people.
[02:56:43.640 --> 02:56:47.082]  Get together and go out into the world and give global speaking tours.
[02:56:47.082 --> 02:56:48.143]  Get some publicity.
[02:56:48.143 --> 02:56:51.144]  Get some power of attention going in the people of the world.
[02:56:51.144 --> 02:56:55.107]  And let's get going somewhere, Alex, because the way we're going, they're killing us.
[02:56:55.107 --> 02:56:56.188]  And I love you.
[02:56:56.188 --> 02:56:57.748]  I appreciate your call.
[02:56:57.748 --> 02:57:02.011]  Everybody gets frustrated by this and thinks I've got the answer to save people.
[02:57:02.011 --> 02:57:02.932]  I don't have the money.
[02:57:04.013 --> 02:57:06.555]  It's true and I understand where he's coming from because
[02:57:31.019 --> 02:57:53.008]  You see, these people, these organizations, have been at war with the world for hundreds of years, and openly so for the last hundred years in their own publications, and of course they have used this time to try and close every possible loophole to stop people stating themselves, if you like, to understand the frustration
[02:57:53.638 --> 02:58:03.260]  But all we can truly do is to get people to individually become active, and if nothing else, plan for themselves and their families, etc.
[02:58:03.260 --> 02:58:06.581]  Pre-contingency plans to try and save themselves.
[02:58:06.581 --> 02:58:08.141]  I understand this.
[02:58:08.141 --> 02:58:10.141]  The whole world is in on this together.
[02:58:10.141 --> 02:58:14.822]  And it doesn't matter, I think, where you run off to today, personally.
[02:58:14.822 --> 02:58:18.163]  I think it's going to be implemented across the planet at the same time.
[02:58:19.187 --> 02:58:21.829]  So, whether we like it or not, we're here in the middle of it.
[02:58:21.829 --> 02:58:25.052]  We've got to fight it right from here as best we can.
[02:58:25.052 --> 02:58:25.832]  As best we can.
[02:58:25.832 --> 02:58:27.393]  All we have at the moment is speech.
[02:58:27.393 --> 02:58:29.075]  That's all we have.
[02:58:29.075 --> 02:58:31.737]  And they are passing bills to eliminate that.
[02:58:31.737 --> 02:58:35.400]  And when they say it's illegal to speak out, we've got to say, no, you're the criminal.
[02:58:35.400 --> 02:58:36.540]  We're standing up against you.
[02:58:36.540 --> 02:58:42.685]  Back in 70 seconds with Alan Watt in the final hour.
[02:58:42.685 --> 02:58:44.106]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:44.106 --> 02:58:47.048]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[02:58:51.186 --> 02:58:52.867]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[02:58:52.867 --> 02:58:57.610]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[02:58:57.610 --> 02:59:00.571]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[02:59:00.571 --> 02:59:03.633]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[02:59:03.633 --> 02:59:08.336]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[02:59:08.556 --> 02:59:09.698]  If you simply prepare.
[02:59:09.698 --> 02:59:12.942]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[02:59:12.942 --> 02:59:19.931]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. coli, salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports.
[02:59:19.931 --> 02:59:23.216]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
[02:59:23.216 --> 02:59:23.476]  Call 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:25.879 --> 02:59:28.341]  Or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:59:28.341 --> 02:59:34.606]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high-quality, prescribed, and dehydrated foods they have to offer.
[02:59:34.606 --> 02:59:38.389]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog, or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[02:59:38.389 --> 02:59:39.650]  Again, 800-409-5633, or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[02:59:39.650 --> 02:59:40.371]  Take action today.
[02:59:40.371 --> 02:59:42.192]  The first step is getting storable food.
[02:59:53.863 --> 02:59:56.264]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.264 --> 03:00:05.226]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:05.226 --> 03:00:13.448]  I'll say this, being on air for almost 14 years, everybody's always saying the New World Order is making their big hot move right now.
[03:00:13.448 --> 03:00:15.709]  And so just bunker down or get ready.
[03:00:16.997 --> 03:00:26.400]  And a lot of people then kind of get in a catatonic state and don't fight it because they imagine instant ratification, instant victory against the corruption, or they think it's futile.
[03:00:26.400 --> 03:00:30.942]  The truth is, they wouldn't be trying to shut down our free speech if they were already all powerful.
[03:00:30.942 --> 03:00:32.022]  They are not invincible.
[03:00:32.022 --> 03:00:37.784]  And there's a huge awakening taking place, and we've got to believe in ourselves enough to be able to defeat this thing.
[03:00:38.664 --> 03:00:41.205]  I know one thing, standing up is not futile.
[03:00:41.205 --> 03:00:42.805]  Alan Watt, our guest, at the bottom of the hour.
[03:00:42.805 --> 03:00:45.186]  I really appreciate all the time he's given us today.
[03:00:45.186 --> 03:00:48.427]  Dave in California, then Deborah, Steve, Gary, and others.
[03:00:48.427 --> 03:00:49.327]  Dave, you're on the air.
[03:00:49.327 --> 03:00:50.767]  Welcome.
[03:00:50.767 --> 03:00:53.648]  Another great show, as usual.
[03:00:53.648 --> 03:00:55.129]  And hello, Alan.
[03:00:55.129 --> 03:00:55.929]  Hello.
[03:00:55.929 --> 03:00:57.289]  I'll make it really fast, guys.
[03:00:57.289 --> 03:01:05.031]  Since we're talking about eugenics, I once heard a wise man say, judges society by how it treats its most vulnerable members.
[03:01:05.031 --> 03:01:07.152]  And regarding that, in California alone,
[03:01:07.779 --> 03:01:08.039]  We're good.
[03:01:28.578 --> 03:01:34.281]  That's the profit, that's the profit.
[03:01:34.281 --> 03:01:42.046]  There's plenty of money to institutionalize you, plenty of money to get you in the system and euthanize you, which they're already doing nationwide, Wall Street Journal admits.
[03:01:42.046 --> 03:01:47.169]  There's plenty of money for all of that, there's just not money for you to be self-sufficient.
[03:01:47.169 --> 03:01:48.190]  Go ahead, sorry.
[03:01:48.190 --> 03:01:54.914]  Right, and we're still, there's only 30,000 convalescent beds available in the state, so I guess they all just get to die.
[03:01:55.760 --> 03:02:01.268]  I see this as Schwarzenegger making his eugenicist bones in California so he can run for president in 2012.
[03:02:01.268 --> 03:02:03.412]  What do you guys think about that?
[03:02:10.492 --> 03:02:25.206]  There's no doubt about it, but we've got to understand when these guys talk about useless eaters, and that's what Russell and others have called people who are not completely physically or mentally healthy, that's the standard eugenicist talk, then they want to eradicate them.
[03:02:25.206 --> 03:02:34.194]  And you'll notice in that big, supposedly open to the public conference they had, that Obama set out on the comparative effectiveness.
[03:02:35.063 --> 03:02:35.723]  I don't know.
[03:02:59.798 --> 03:03:00.900]  He walked off with a video.
[03:03:12.364 --> 03:03:20.549]  In the book written by Daschle, who was going to be the head of health care, he says, yes, if you're an old person, you don't get the same access a young person does.
[03:03:20.549 --> 03:03:22.050]  You're not as valuable.
[03:03:22.050 --> 03:03:25.793]  This isn't some right-wing thing attacking socialized health care.
[03:03:25.793 --> 03:03:28.955]  This is a fact.
[03:03:28.955 --> 03:03:32.017]  Socialized health care is an aspirin for a heart attack.
[03:03:32.017 --> 03:03:35.599]  Obama is in there, and I appreciate your call, sir, pushing it right now.
[03:03:35.599 --> 03:03:38.581]  Why don't you explain to folks what universal health care means?
[03:03:38.581 --> 03:03:41.043]  It means universal eugenics death care.
[03:03:41.693 --> 03:03:42.053]  It does.
[03:03:42.053 --> 03:03:48.139]  You understand that Britain was one of the first countries in Canada to bring out socialized healthcare.
[03:03:48.139 --> 03:03:50.060]  Thompson was the guy who brought out Canada.
[03:03:50.060 --> 03:04:00.490]  He's up on Wikipedia right now because he was a top eugenicist who talked openly about culling off the unfit, the infirm, and useless eaters.
[03:04:00.490 --> 03:04:03.432]  He brought healthcare into Canada, socialized medicine.
[03:04:03.432 --> 03:04:05.694]  Where I live here, you can't get a doctor.
[03:04:05.694 --> 03:04:06.595]  You cannot get one.
[03:04:07.521 --> 03:04:12.967]  And what they prescribe in Canada for pretty well all problems is simply painkillers.
[03:04:12.967 --> 03:04:13.548]  Just go home.
[03:04:13.548 --> 03:04:17.653]  If you don't feel the pain, the disease can progress and get worse and you'll die.
[03:04:17.653 --> 03:04:18.994]  That's basically what it is.
[03:04:18.994 --> 03:04:24.180]  It's cost-effectiveness because socialized medicine comes under a government policy.
[03:04:24.180 --> 03:04:26.383]  Government policy is the key.
[03:04:26.383 --> 03:04:28.145]  And it's all to do with economics.
[03:04:29.480 --> 03:04:33.363]  But meanwhile, the elites are going to get all the life extension technologies.
[03:04:33.363 --> 03:04:35.685]  That's why they call medicine a practice.
[03:04:35.685 --> 03:04:46.374]  They cold-bloodedly practice on us and then develop what works, keep the good stuff for themselves, nothing for us but death.
[03:04:46.374 --> 03:04:47.294]  Very cold-blooded.
[03:04:47.294 --> 03:04:58.844]  They believe that's why they're the scientific risen man or the illumined man, because they can cold-bloodedly slaughter us, see our pain, just like the first psychiatrist lobotomizing people with ice picks.

[03:06:00.942 --> 03:06:06.787]  This is Alex Jones, and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us and the Truth Movement for years.
[03:06:06.787 --> 03:06:08.109]  Inner Health Botanicals.
[03:06:08.109 --> 03:06:12.373]  This company produces the highest quality superfood around, called Inner Food.
[03:06:12.373 --> 03:06:14.234]  My wife just loves the stuff.
[03:06:14.234 --> 03:06:20.540]  And now, the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded Inner Food his Editor's Choice Award for Best Superfood of 2009.
[03:06:21.681 --> 03:06:24.542]  Inner Food is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients.
[03:06:24.542 --> 03:06:26.283]  No fillers, no sweeteners.
[03:06:26.283 --> 03:06:29.285]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price.
[03:06:29.285 --> 03:06:31.005]  And their formula really works.
[03:06:31.005 --> 03:06:33.827]  This is the real thing for the great health you need.
[03:06:33.827 --> 03:06:35.307]  Try the NutriCafe.
[03:06:35.307 --> 03:06:40.070]  Their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.
[03:06:40.070 --> 03:06:42.491]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great.
[03:06:42.491 --> 03:06:44.952]  And take it from me folks, it really does taste great.
[03:06:44.952 --> 03:06:47.053]  Don't forget to try their other great products.
[03:06:47.053 --> 03:06:48.634]  Go to www.
[03:06:50.075 --> 03:06:52.398]  We're good to go.
[03:07:01.152 --> 03:07:02.133]  A guy named M.Z.
[03:07:02.133 --> 03:07:05.535]  in Santa Cruz, California, who owns one of our affiliate radio stations.
[03:07:05.535 --> 03:07:08.097]  He got laid off from a job he loved many years ago.
[03:07:08.097 --> 03:07:17.785]  He was devastated, but it taught him a lesson very early in life, that even when you do a great job for someone, and your boss tells you how much he appreciates you every day, there is no job security.
[03:07:17.785 --> 03:07:23.969]  You are always in danger of losing your job, unless you take charge of your livelihood and own your own business.
[03:07:23.969 --> 03:07:26.671]  Since you are the boss, nobody can fire you.
[03:07:26.671 --> 03:07:27.532]  So M.Z.
[03:07:27.532 --> 03:07:29.053]  has been his own boss for over 37 years.
[03:07:30.194 --> 03:07:30.514]  I think so.
[03:07:52.896 --> 03:07:54.358]  OwnMyself.com.
[03:07:54.358 --> 03:07:58.142]  It takes very little money, and if you're interested, MZ wants to talk to you.
[03:07:58.142 --> 03:08:00.625]  Remember, Chocolate.OwnMyself.com.
[03:08:02.699 --> 03:08:09.322]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.322 --> 03:08:13.184]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:13.184 --> 03:08:16.746]  All right, hurrying through your calls for Alan Wan, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[03:08:16.746 --> 03:08:19.588]  We're live here Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[03:08:19.588 --> 03:08:20.228]  to 3 p.m.
[03:08:20.228 --> 03:08:21.229]  Central Standard Time.
[03:08:21.229 --> 03:08:23.390]  That's 12 noon to 4 p.m.
[03:08:23.390 --> 03:08:25.011]  Eastern.
[03:08:25.011 --> 03:08:26.451]  And of course, that's 9 a.m.
[03:08:26.451 --> 03:08:28.733]  to 1 p.m.
[03:08:28.733 --> 03:08:29.353]  Pacific.
[03:08:32.160 --> 03:08:33.841]  10 to 2 Mountain.
[03:08:33.841 --> 03:08:38.522]  We have a free podcast downloaded by over 150 plus thousand people a day.
[03:08:38.522 --> 03:08:46.725]  If you go to InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com, you can click on the free podcast and download it to your MP3 or iPod device.
[03:08:46.725 --> 03:08:49.906]  Listen how you want, when you want, where you want.
[03:08:49.906 --> 03:08:54.468]  And we're getting a lot of new AminFM affiliates, a lot of new listeners on the internet.
[03:08:54.468 --> 03:08:56.129]  We're just exploding.
[03:08:56.129 --> 03:08:57.089]  And that is heartening.
[03:08:58.114 --> 03:09:16.684]  It's also a little bit scary because there's a lot of black ops going on against us, a lot of people posing as us, going around saying horrible racist things on the web, a lot of people pulling other dirty tricks, and a lot of media coming after us, mainstream media coming after us.
[03:09:16.684 --> 03:09:21.267]  That really is our badge of courage, the red badge of courage as they say.
[03:09:23.274 --> 03:09:27.159]  I get so many emails going, you woke me up but now I know your New World Order.
[03:09:27.159 --> 03:09:29.702]  So that's kind of how the COINTELPRO works as well.
[03:09:29.702 --> 03:09:32.465]  We're here just covering facts, information, data.
[03:09:32.465 --> 03:09:34.267]  You make what decisions you want from it.
[03:09:34.267 --> 03:09:38.472]  COINTELPRO spends all their time saying everybody else are government agents.
[03:09:38.472 --> 03:09:40.334]  There's actually not that many government agents.
[03:09:42.774 --> 03:09:46.297]  As people would think, they're just there getting us all to fight with each other.
[03:09:46.297 --> 03:09:59.187]  Alan, I want to spend a few minutes on that, the dirty tricks you've been through, so we can try to get people to be aware of this, and to stop spending their time ninnying and infighting, and to also not believe something when they hear your voice edited weird, or changed.
[03:09:59.187 --> 03:10:01.469]  They do that to me as well, we were talking about it.
[03:10:01.469 --> 03:10:09.094]  Or when they see sites that look like yours, but aren't yours, but don't list their URLs, that only helps them, which then lists linked to white supremacist stuff.
[03:10:10.089 --> 03:10:14.051]  We've proven that the ADL and Southern Poverty Law Center and other groups are tied in.
[03:10:14.051 --> 03:10:17.353]  The cases of Southern Poverty Law Center are running white supremacist groups.
[03:10:17.353 --> 03:10:19.735]  FBI doesn't just infiltrate white supremacists.
[03:10:19.735 --> 03:10:20.495]  They found them.
[03:10:20.495 --> 03:10:21.616]  They run them.
[03:10:21.616 --> 03:10:27.479]  Then they always try to act like they're the Liberty Movement, the Freedom Movement, so the media can then demonize us.
[03:10:27.479 --> 03:10:31.922]  Every time I have a big national reporter here, they ask me, do you like Hitler, Alex?
[03:10:31.922 --> 03:10:35.724]  And then I say, no, I think he's really kind of goofy.
[03:10:35.724 --> 03:10:37.765]  Oh, you do like him, don't you?
[03:10:37.765 --> 03:10:38.286]  Don't you?
[03:10:39.011 --> 03:10:49.376]  You know, so this is really something they're trying to put on us because they don't want us bringing everybody in together for liberty and freedom and awakening against the tyranny of the globalists.
[03:10:49.376 --> 03:10:55.580]  And so I'm really seeing them go after myself and you and a few other people.
[03:10:55.580 --> 03:11:02.803]  And then a lot of well-meaning people have kind of fallen in to the bashing one particular group or the other.
[03:11:02.803 --> 03:11:05.585]  And that's how they want us is factionalized.
[03:11:05.585 --> 03:11:06.785]  Alan, what?
[03:11:06.785 --> 03:11:07.966]  Yes, true.
[03:11:09.392 --> 03:11:22.619]  A good documentary was done on the white supremacist groups a long time ago by the BBC, where they showed you different police outfits raiding some of the headquarters where they were having meetings.
[03:11:22.619 --> 03:11:27.922]  And one famous one, they turned out 200 people from inside this meeting.
[03:11:27.922 --> 03:11:32.064]  And by the end of the night, they'd only kept a couple and charged them.
[03:11:32.836 --> 03:11:41.441]  Everyone else, it turned out, belonged to other departments of US police organizations that were all infiltrating.
[03:11:41.441 --> 03:11:47.905]  In other words, the entire membership was made up almost of all government agents trying to find the real ones.
[03:11:47.905 --> 03:11:52.928]  And the two that they arrested were just guys off the street that came in for a free coffee.
[03:11:52.928 --> 03:12:01.353]  So it's common knowledge that the white supremacist groups have been funded from the beginning by government agencies.
[03:12:01.912 --> 03:12:07.153]  Because they're very handy to help smear people by association, if they can do it.
[03:12:07.153 --> 03:12:12.974]  If they can't take you down by what you're saying, they have to do a character assassination upon you.
[03:12:12.974 --> 03:12:25.637]  And I've had videos up there, I've seen them, where people will take different words that you say, string them together, easy to do with a computer, and have you saying completely erroneous things altogether.
[03:12:25.637 --> 03:12:30.158]  But there is an organized effort out there, and a funded effort, I should say, too,
[03:12:31.225 --> 03:12:32.385]  To help us to fame.
[03:12:32.385 --> 03:12:36.267]  I've had fake sites go up that you'd almost swear were mine.
[03:12:36.267 --> 03:12:40.988]  And you had to go into them, take the links off them to find out who was behind it.
[03:12:40.988 --> 03:12:43.049]  And it went right to the usual thing.
[03:12:43.049 --> 03:12:46.530]  It's just the Jews and it was anti-Semitic and so on.
[03:12:46.530 --> 03:12:49.231]  But for someone looking in, they would have thought it was genuine.
[03:12:50.795 --> 03:12:54.457]  And so I notice I'm attacked by the ADL, the Southern Poverty Law Center.
[03:12:54.457 --> 03:12:58.099]  The first person they attacked when Plosky shot those cops was me.
[03:12:58.099 --> 03:13:02.021]  Within hours they fed my name off his computer, thousands of sites.
[03:13:03.444 --> 03:13:06.766]  To attack me, and then it turned out that Poplowski actually didn't like me.
[03:13:06.766 --> 03:13:09.088]  It looks like it was being federally handled.
[03:13:09.088 --> 03:13:10.809]  Just like Von Brun.
[03:13:10.809 --> 03:13:12.471]  And so that's kind of creepy, you know?
[03:13:12.471 --> 03:13:22.918]  I'm the first guy they're trying to go after now, then meanwhile they have the white supremacists after me, because I won't play the Southern Poverty Law Center's game of making it racial politics.
[03:13:22.918 --> 03:13:24.719]  I'm trying to appeal to everybody.
[03:13:24.719 --> 03:13:27.001]  Big Tent waking up the mass.
[03:13:27.001 --> 03:13:28.022]  They're desperate!
[03:13:28.562 --> 03:13:41.568]  Two, at one level have the Nazis say, I'm a Zionist agent, and at the other end have the Israeli ops and others attacking me, which shows these are jaws, top and bottom jaws on the same crocodile.
[03:13:41.568 --> 03:13:42.248]  Absolutely.
[03:13:42.248 --> 03:13:43.048]  They work together.
[03:13:43.048 --> 03:13:44.969]  They've always worked together.
[03:13:44.969 --> 03:13:46.730]  There's no secret in that.
[03:13:46.730 --> 03:13:51.092]  One of the biggest cases in Canada, you probably remember Ernest Zundel.
[03:13:51.092 --> 03:13:51.632]  Yes.
[03:13:51.632 --> 03:13:57.815]  Ernest Zundel single-handedly managed to get what they wanted through in the court system, and that was the hate laws.
[03:13:58.752 --> 03:14:03.935]  But I could not figure out why on earth the Canadian government gave this man so much publicity.
[03:14:03.935 --> 03:14:07.777]  I mean, they could have said nothing and no one would ever have heard of him.
[03:14:07.777 --> 03:14:15.621]  And yet it was in all the national papers, ongoing, right up to the Supreme Court, where I think he was allowed to stay in Canada for a while.
[03:14:15.621 --> 03:14:28.307]  But it came out in the Toronto Sun and the Star a couple of years after all of this that his right-hand man, in this white supremacist movement, surrounded by skinheads, his right-hand man,
[03:14:28.772 --> 03:14:28.972]  Listen!
[03:14:44.266 --> 03:14:44.646]  When I was
[03:15:07.150 --> 03:15:10.812]  I don't know how these cops live with themselves, because they set up a lot of people.
[03:15:10.812 --> 03:15:11.212]  Yes, they do.
[03:15:11.212 --> 03:15:14.474]  And I know they're circling me like a pack of sharks.
[03:15:14.474 --> 03:15:17.175]  And then they shoot their kids up with mercury, too.
[03:15:17.175 --> 03:15:18.215]  They give them fluoride.
[03:15:18.215 --> 03:15:20.156]  I mean, you're killing your own kids!
[03:15:20.156 --> 03:15:21.977]  We're the good guys!
[03:15:21.977 --> 03:15:24.038]  Why do you hate us so much?
[03:15:24.038 --> 03:15:33.223]  But I guess they don't like us because they like their petty power trip, and we're kind of raining on their delusion that they're the cops and they frame the bad guys and that's how they get it done.
[03:15:34.704 --> 03:15:36.685]  What about the enforcers' psychology?
[03:15:36.685 --> 03:15:37.205]  Go ahead.
[03:15:37.205 --> 03:15:38.045]  Yeah, they're on a team.
[03:15:38.045 --> 03:15:42.127]  You see, they've literally militarized all police forces.
[03:15:42.127 --> 03:15:43.868]  They have done that for years.
[03:15:43.868 --> 03:15:50.090]  They use the same bonding techniques, super bonding techniques you get in the military, where they stand up for each other.
[03:15:50.090 --> 03:15:53.972]  They're outside of city streets, as they call it, civilian streets.
[03:15:53.972 --> 03:15:55.232]  They're special.
[03:15:55.232 --> 03:15:57.973]  And the brotherhood is all, that's all there is.
[03:15:57.973 --> 03:16:00.394]  The brotherhood, you must preserve the brotherhood.
[03:16:00.394 --> 03:16:04.316]  And really, they can be kept in their own little paradigm, their little Plato's cave.
[03:16:04.816 --> 03:16:05.177]  We're good to go.
[03:16:25.495 --> 03:16:27.896]  What does the elite think of us?
[03:16:27.896 --> 03:16:33.699]  What is their view of an Alan Watt and Alex Jones, somebody that sees with horror their operation and their plan?
[03:16:33.699 --> 03:16:37.060]  I mean, I certainly know they're trying to hurt us, trying to shut us down.
[03:16:37.060 --> 03:16:38.221]  Why don't they just kill us?
[03:16:38.221 --> 03:16:42.363]  You know, we get that question a lot.
[03:16:42.363 --> 03:16:45.904]  They don't want marchers, number one.
[03:16:45.904 --> 03:16:48.545]  Marchers are bad news for any movement.
[03:16:48.545 --> 03:16:52.207]  In fact, they generally get so many recruits into a movement once someone
[03:16:52.850 --> 03:16:59.071]  That's why the CIA probably killed, they're now saying that Iranian girl, Nada, she's their cause celeb.
[03:16:59.071 --> 03:17:01.092]  Go ahead.
[03:17:01.092 --> 03:17:03.252]  Oh yeah.
[03:17:03.252 --> 03:17:20.116]  And apart from that, to be honest with you, I think they're so arrogant right now, because they do with the internet, they put a daily, they take the daily pulse off the public, they know what they're chatting about, their text messages and so on, they know what their conversations are, it's all from TV and entertainment and so on.
[03:17:21.786 --> 03:17:33.270]  Yeah, it's very, very sick.
[03:17:33.270 --> 03:17:40.952]  I mean, you talk to these reporters who you know are working on the other side, and they'll basically, in private, go, yeah, I know that's the way it is, but what are you going to do about it?
[03:17:40.952 --> 03:17:44.293]  And they're kind of getting off like they're part of the system.
[03:17:44.293 --> 03:17:49.875]  And I don't understand how they drink the fluoride, they take the shots, they die for it.
[03:17:51.580 --> 03:17:54.403]  I guess it's the mind game of like dress-up or make-believe.
[03:17:54.403 --> 03:17:56.505]  They make-believe they're with it.
[03:17:56.505 --> 03:18:01.991]  It'd be like running out in front of a Mack truck going 100 miles an hour and going, I'm with you, I'm with you, and it just splats you.
[03:18:01.991 --> 03:18:13.142]  But you feel like you were with it, so instead of just not jumping out in front of it, I... It also comes into... You see, this is the generation where they're pulling it off.
[03:18:13.843 --> 03:18:16.545]  Previous generations, the guys were basically prostitutes.
[03:18:16.545 --> 03:18:20.468]  They knew it would come down eventually on the general public, but not their generation.
[03:18:20.468 --> 03:18:21.169]  They'd live through it.
[03:18:21.169 --> 03:18:22.570]  I'd be okay.
[03:18:22.570 --> 03:18:28.034]  This particular group are just as much in denial, I think, of the general public.
[03:18:28.034 --> 03:18:37.461]  They can't believe it could be as bad as that, and they themselves may possibly succumb to infections or plagues or whatever is released.
[03:18:37.461 --> 03:18:41.645]  So they hope that just by simply being good and staying in denial, they might be
[03:18:42.560 --> 03:18:43.941]  Hey, be chosen.
[03:18:43.941 --> 03:18:53.429]  I should mention, though, that back in the 90s, this happened across the Commonwealth countries, Canada, the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, maybe in the States, too.
[03:18:53.429 --> 03:18:58.053]  It came out when Preston Manning was in the Parliament.
[03:18:58.053 --> 03:19:03.978]  The parliamentarians voted themselves the right to top medical treatment.
[03:19:03.978 --> 03:19:10.403]  In a country of socialized medicine, remember, top medical treatment was then for them and their families only.
[03:19:11.121 --> 03:19:15.482]  And the high-level bureaucrats within top military hospitals.
[03:19:15.482 --> 03:19:17.183]  And I thought, well, what's this for?
[03:19:17.183 --> 03:19:18.363]  That's like North Korea.
[03:19:18.363 --> 03:19:19.463]  That's like North Korea.
[03:19:19.463 --> 03:19:19.903]  Yeah.
[03:19:19.903 --> 03:19:25.645]  So what they're getting, and this is how they get people on board, if you go along with this, you will be saved.
[03:19:25.645 --> 03:19:27.245]  We'll give you the top treatment.
[03:19:27.245 --> 03:19:30.686]  We'll give you the real inoculations, the real antidotes, etc.
[03:19:30.686 --> 03:19:37.148]  for you and your families if you go along with this and you have all the organic, good food to eat, etc., etc.
[03:19:37.148 --> 03:19:37.788]  That's the deal.
[03:19:38.448 --> 03:19:39.009]  Exactly.
[03:19:39.009 --> 03:19:43.093]  So out of fear of their own system, they go, all right, I'll help you murder them.
[03:19:43.093 --> 03:19:44.494]  All right, I'll be evil.
[03:19:44.494 --> 03:19:46.857]  And they go, now you're with us.
[03:19:46.857 --> 03:19:50.200]  But there's always a night of the long knives for you.
[03:19:50.200 --> 03:19:54.104]  And you're going to be betrayed, just like those torturers followed orders.
[03:19:54.104 --> 03:19:56.046]  And then Bush cut them loose.
[03:19:56.046 --> 03:19:57.728]  Remember that.
[03:19:57.728 --> 03:19:58.429]  We'll be right back.
[03:20:01.525 --> 03:20:04.047]  It's a new year full of uncertainties.
[03:20:04.047 --> 03:20:06.388]  People are being laid off in record numbers.
[03:20:06.388 --> 03:20:10.611]  The price of food continues to rise, and the economy continues to falter.
[03:20:10.611 --> 03:20:12.912]  You know that you need to prepare.
[03:20:12.912 --> 03:20:16.715]  And maybe you've been putting it off, but the time to act is now.
[03:20:16.715 --> 03:20:19.777]  That's why you need to visit OrganicaSeed.com.
[03:20:20.297 --> 03:20:32.695]  At OrganicaSeed.com you'll find one of the largest online selections of heirloom seeds, survival seed packs, as well as the giant vegetable seed collections that can feed you and your family for years.

[03:20:35.419 --> 03:20:35.939]  It is a big idea.
[03:20:35.939 --> 03:20:37.020]  A new world order.
[03:21:05.709 --> 03:21:09.853]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[03:21:09.853 --> 03:21:13.016]  It's known as the Bilderberg Group.
[03:21:13.016 --> 03:21:16.219]  Couldn't their objective be world domination?
[03:21:16.219 --> 03:21:19.422]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[03:21:19.422 --> 03:21:26.728]  Now, as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity is at hand.
[03:21:29.758 --> 03:21:35.202]  For the first time in history, the elite's plan for world government is blown wide open.
[03:21:35.202 --> 03:21:39.064]  You will learn the secret that drives the entire New World Order agenda.
[03:21:39.064 --> 03:21:41.626]  Bill of Rights is making great progress toward a world government.
[03:21:41.626 --> 03:21:42.807]  Most people have no idea.
[03:21:42.807 --> 03:21:43.587]  They're not after money.
[03:21:43.587 --> 03:21:44.868]  They have all the money they need.
[03:21:44.868 --> 03:21:45.849]  They're after power.
[03:21:45.849 --> 03:21:46.990]  That's what they have to do.

[03:21:55.715 --> 03:21:56.496]  In Game.
[03:21:56.496 --> 03:21:58.517]  Blueprint for global enslavement.
[03:21:58.517 --> 03:21:59.598]  You have been warned.
[03:22:00.419 --> 03:22:07.086]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years, hoping to build up enough wealth to retire and live out their golden years.
[03:22:07.086 --> 03:22:15.215]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[03:22:15.215 --> 03:22:20.801]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise, or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve Note forcing us into perpetual debt?
[03:22:21.121 --> 03:22:23.362]  Ensuring inflation and higher taxes.
[03:22:23.362 --> 03:22:28.464]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll Island.
[03:22:28.464 --> 03:22:33.686]  Congressman Ron Paul states, it's what every American needs to know about central bank power.
[03:22:33.686 --> 03:22:38.027]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[03:22:38.027 --> 03:22:39.108]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[03:22:39.108 --> 03:22:43.629]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[03:22:43.629 --> 03:22:44.990]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[03:22:48.511 --> 03:22:51.515]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[03:22:51.515 --> 03:22:53.276]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[03:22:53.276 --> 03:22:53.517]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[03:23:00.037 --> 03:23:03.559]  More than 700 chemicals have been found in our drinking water.
[03:23:03.559 --> 03:23:08.963]  And did you know that you have greater exposure to these chemicals while taking hot showers than when drinking the water?
[03:23:08.963 --> 03:23:13.926]  That's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate, and others are absorbed into the skin.
[03:23:13.926 --> 03:23:24.894]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter works with both hot and cold water, and it's designed to reduce chlorine, lead, mercury, and iron, and it inhibits the growth of bacteria, mold, algae, and fungus.
[03:23:25.174 --> 03:23:30.916]  The KDF Dual Media Shower Filter typically lasts 10,000 gallons, or 1 year whichever comes first.
[03:23:30.916 --> 03:23:37.159]  Hospitals, restaurants, and water treatment facilities use this media to reduce chlorine, iron, heavy metals and bacteria.
[03:23:37.159 --> 03:23:38.019]  What about you?
[03:23:38.019 --> 03:23:44.241]  Order your KDF Shower Filter normally, $49 for a special price of only $39.99, with free shipping.

[03:24:13.551 --> 03:24:18.696]  You know, it's magic to be alive.
[03:24:18.696 --> 03:24:19.396]  It's so wonderful.
[03:24:19.396 --> 03:24:26.483]  We're on this planet, depths of space, all this beauty around us, the atmosphere, the birds, the trees, flowers, life.
[03:24:26.483 --> 03:24:32.228]  I can just sit there in my yard looking at the grass and little spider or bugs walking around.
[03:24:32.228 --> 03:24:35.030]  It's all majesty.
[03:24:35.030 --> 03:24:39.114]  Meanwhile, the Madison Avenue has you feeling insecure, all focused, feeling dirty, feeling weak.
[03:24:40.589 --> 03:24:44.051]  And they've always got new poisons to sell you to supposedly fulfill you.
[03:24:44.051 --> 03:24:47.633]  Allen's agreed to stay with us the full transmission, so another 35 minutes.
[03:24:47.633 --> 03:24:50.115]  Very honored to have him with us.
[03:24:50.115 --> 03:24:53.076]  Let's go ahead and go back to the calls.
[03:24:53.076 --> 03:24:58.339]  Deborah in Illinois, then Steve, Gary, Jonathan, Tatina, and others.
[03:24:58.339 --> 03:24:59.200]  Debbie, you're on the air.
[03:24:59.200 --> 03:25:00.521]  Go ahead.
[03:25:00.521 --> 03:25:01.361]  Hi, Alex.
[03:25:01.361 --> 03:25:02.782]  Hi, Allen.
[03:25:02.782 --> 03:25:07.184]  Thanks for everything you do to inform us.
[03:25:07.184 --> 03:25:08.245]  I'm calling in.
[03:25:08.245 --> 03:25:09.626]  I wanted to inform you
[03:25:11.005 --> 03:25:23.447]  I had a local TV station do a hit number on me regarding the jet contrails that I've been watching spray us since March and I've been photographing.
[03:25:23.447 --> 03:25:23.748]  I sent
[03:25:24.802 --> 03:25:37.868]  Yeah, what they're doing is they simultaneously do pieces on locals saying it doesn't exist while telling you in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal and USA Today that, oh, we're spraying you now to save the earth.
[03:25:37.868 --> 03:25:44.651]  But then, see, it's good when they say it, but when you say, hey, you know, contrails, you know, are ice.
[03:25:44.651 --> 03:25:45.811]  They stay there a minute or so.
[03:25:45.811 --> 03:25:48.753]  Those stay there all day and turn into clouds.
[03:25:48.753 --> 03:25:50.273]  They go, oh, you're insane.
[03:25:50.273 --> 03:25:51.534]  So what did the locals do to you?
[03:25:52.574 --> 03:25:55.856]  Well, it's a really crazy story.
[03:25:55.856 --> 03:25:59.117]  I called in to report all these jets.
[03:25:59.117 --> 03:26:01.879]  Some days were worse than others.
[03:26:01.879 --> 03:26:03.940]  And they seemed interested.
[03:26:03.940 --> 03:26:04.480]  They came out.
[03:26:04.480 --> 03:26:06.741]  They did an interview for an hour.
[03:26:06.741 --> 03:26:09.222]  Then they took sound bites of what I said.
[03:26:09.222 --> 03:26:20.568]  And then they put me up against a jet mechanic from the local college who said that chemicals aren't being sprayed.
[03:26:21.392 --> 03:26:32.986]  And then I was also pitted up against a weather forecaster out of Chicago who said that the weather modification experiments were
[03:26:33.904 --> 03:26:35.725]  Done in the seventies as far as he knew.
[03:26:35.725 --> 03:26:37.946]  There's not any more being done.
[03:26:37.946 --> 03:26:39.387]  There's scores of U.S.
[03:26:39.387 --> 03:26:45.730]  companies doing it full-time publicly and hundreds of universities and government agencies openly admit they're doing it.
[03:26:45.730 --> 03:26:49.392]  The president's announcing they're getting ready to do it on a mass scale.
[03:26:49.392 --> 03:26:55.756]  But see, this is the example of how the propaganda works and these locals feel like they're powerful.
[03:26:55.756 --> 03:26:58.837]  They're part of the system exposing this kook.
[03:26:58.837 --> 03:27:00.918]  But really, they're in Plato's cave.
[03:27:00.918 --> 03:27:01.779]  Alan Watt comments.
[03:27:02.461 --> 03:27:03.242]  Yes, true.
[03:27:03.242 --> 03:27:04.824]  Again, it's a form of double-think.
[03:27:04.824 --> 03:27:06.726]  They're kept in double-think.
[03:27:06.726 --> 03:27:08.648]  In fact, you're taught to deny your own senses.
[03:27:08.648 --> 03:27:11.852]  That's the key to it, when you see them yourself.
[03:27:11.852 --> 03:27:13.854]  You're taught, that can't be happening.
[03:27:13.854 --> 03:27:15.556]  The media would have told me so.
[03:27:15.556 --> 03:27:20.502]  That's how most people reason today, that the media does their reasoning for them, according to Brzezinski.
[03:27:21.352 --> 03:27:25.373]  But yeah, they will poo-poo you when you see them in your local area.
[03:27:25.373 --> 03:27:29.253]  And they'll even tell you, well, they might be spraying, but not where you are.
[03:27:29.253 --> 03:27:33.114]  As though it's some freak sort of thing if it occurred over your head.
[03:27:33.114 --> 03:27:37.675]  But yeah, they've been spraying daily almost since 1998.
[03:27:37.675 --> 03:27:41.455]  And I remember the first day it started in Ontario, they were half the height.
[03:27:41.455 --> 03:27:44.436]  The whole sky was agrid on the very first day.
[03:27:44.436 --> 03:27:47.376]  And that's when the bronchial problem started with everyone.
[03:27:47.376 --> 03:27:50.497]  It got so bad three, four years ago, most of the birds were dead.
[03:27:51.477 --> 03:27:54.298]  And they've changed their mixes even as they go along.
[03:27:54.298 --> 03:27:57.279]  They don't do the full spray generally across the entire sky.
[03:27:57.279 --> 03:28:01.401]  They do it in short bursts that turn into clouds more rapidly.
[03:28:01.401 --> 03:28:04.182]  But this is old stuff and I've covered it.
[03:28:04.182 --> 03:28:13.406]  Teller, the guy who invented the H-bomb, was the guy who brought to the Pentagon the whole idea of floating lots of particles of barium.
[03:28:14.011 --> 03:28:14.231]  Absolutely.
[03:28:14.231 --> 03:28:14.671]  So how did this end?
[03:28:14.671 --> 03:28:19.992]  Just that you're an evil thought criminal and everybody giggled and laughed and said Mercury was good for them?
[03:28:43.081 --> 03:28:51.803]  No, but the crazy part about it was then, a month prior to that, we had mysterious goo left on lawns.
[03:28:51.803 --> 03:28:53.923]  And they did a story on that.
[03:28:53.923 --> 03:29:03.465]  And you can go to mystateline.com and search for mysterious goo left on lawn.
[03:29:03.465 --> 03:29:05.906]  And that was done on May 7th.
[03:29:05.906 --> 03:29:08.587]  And then you can also go to What's That Slimy Gel?
[03:29:08.587 --> 03:29:10.187]  The next day they did another piece.
[03:29:11.906 --> 03:29:13.747]  And that's May 8th.
[03:29:13.747 --> 03:29:14.467]  Alright, thank you.
[03:29:14.467 --> 03:29:17.109]  We actually had... Ma'am?
[03:29:17.109 --> 03:29:17.729]  Go ahead.
[03:29:17.729 --> 03:29:22.352]  We actually had gel.
[03:29:22.352 --> 03:29:23.592]  That's what they had in Scotland.
[03:29:23.592 --> 03:29:29.956]  The Scottish newspapers are also... I showed you the photographs of this mysterious gel that's breaking all over the island.
[03:29:29.956 --> 03:29:31.157]  Yeah, we got a break here, ma'am.
[03:29:31.157 --> 03:29:31.437]  Thank you.
[03:29:32.526 --> 03:29:44.709]  Meanwhile, the media never looks at the Daily Oklahoman or hundreds of other papers when they admit, oh, Homeland Security will spray every town in the state of Oklahoma, this was in 2006, with Subtilis Globigi bacteria.
[03:29:44.709 --> 03:29:48.330]  Don't worry, it only causes spontaneous abortions in all mammal species.
[03:29:48.330 --> 03:29:51.690]  That's in the news, and they just go, I love it!
[03:29:51.690 --> 03:29:53.091]  We're on the march.
[03:29:53.091 --> 03:29:55.631]  The empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.631 --> 03:29:58.312]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:01.291 --> 03:30:06.493]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer.
[03:30:06.493 --> 03:30:10.515]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:30:10.515 --> 03:30:16.418]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:30:16.418 --> 03:30:21.481]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:30:21.481 --> 03:30:21.941]  Number three,
[03:30:22.401 --> 03:30:28.705]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[03:30:28.705 --> 03:30:31.607]  The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[03:30:31.607 --> 03:30:36.110]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:30:36.110 --> 03:30:39.732]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[03:30:39.972 --> 03:30:45.695]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a longtime sponsor of ours.
[03:30:45.695 --> 03:30:50.397]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:30:50.397 --> 03:30:52.158]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:30:52.158 --> 03:30:54.739]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun yet.
[03:30:54.739 --> 03:30:57.380]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call toll-free 877-327-0365.
[03:31:00.933 --> 03:31:02.315]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:31:02.315 --> 03:31:04.297]  Have you heard of the Millionaire Patriot?
[03:31:04.297 --> 03:31:04.958]  Well, you should.
[03:31:04.958 --> 03:31:09.783]  He has a free handgun and five days of firearms training waiting for you.
[03:31:09.783 --> 03:31:10.584]  That's right.
[03:31:10.584 --> 03:31:19.254]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-state concealed weapons permit.
[03:31:19.254 --> 03:31:20.615]  All for pennies on the dollar.
[03:31:20.615 --> 03:31:21.757]  Plus, if you act fast.
[03:31:21.957 --> 03:31:27.941]  The Millionaire Patriot will give you a free Springfield Armory XD pistol in the caliber of your choice.
[03:31:27.941 --> 03:31:34.825]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained to levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards.
[03:31:34.825 --> 03:31:40.349]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality or drill instructor attitudes.
[03:31:40.349 --> 03:31:41.810]  This is real.
[03:31:41.810 --> 03:31:42.870]  Don't miss out.
[03:31:42.870 --> 03:31:49.735]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit for pennies on the dollar.
[03:31:49.975 --> 03:31:50.735]  Aerial spraying.
[03:31:50.735 --> 03:31:51.415]  Chemtrails.
[03:31:51.415 --> 03:31:52.656]  The modified atmosphere.
[03:31:52.656 --> 03:31:54.276]  Heavy metals and pesticides.
[03:31:54.276 --> 03:31:58.257]  Carcinogens and chemical fibers all falling from the sky.
[03:32:19.437 --> 03:32:22.518]  You have a choice to keep your body clean.
[03:32:22.518 --> 03:32:29.719]  Detoxify with micro plant powder from hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608.
[03:32:29.719 --> 03:32:36.941]  It's odorless and tasteless and used in any liquid or food.
[03:32:36.941 --> 03:32:40.821]  Protect your family now with micro plant powder.
[03:32:40.821 --> 03:32:44.702]  Cleaning out heavy metals, parasites and toxins.
[03:32:44.702 --> 03:32:49.223]  Order it now for daily intake and stock it now for long term storage.
[03:32:49.855 --> 03:32:53.020]  Visit hempusa.org or call 908-691-2608 today!
[03:33:06.789 --> 03:33:12.251]  All right, we had that last call in about five minutes and she's making great points, but I want to go to other calls and give everybody a chance.
[03:33:12.251 --> 03:33:14.452]  We're going to run out of time here with Alan Watt.
[03:33:14.452 --> 03:33:21.114]  And I want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that have made the show possible today before we continue on with your phone calls.
[03:33:21.114 --> 03:33:23.355]  And some other news items I want to bring up here with Alan Watt today.
[03:33:26.374 --> 03:33:29.136]  One of the sponsors I want to tell you about is FrontSight.com.
[03:33:29.136 --> 03:33:32.979]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot, Dr. Ignatius Piazza?
[03:33:32.979 --> 03:33:39.264]  The founder of the FrontSight Firearms Training Institute is offering a free handgun and five days of firearms training to my listeners.
[03:33:39.264 --> 03:33:40.845]  That's free handgun.
[03:33:40.845 --> 03:33:47.450]  The offer is only available for a limited time because Dr. Piazza is literally paying his own money out of pocket to be able to offer you this deal.
[03:33:47.450 --> 03:33:48.871]  And it won't last forever, so listen up.
[03:33:49.491 --> 03:33:58.379]  You can attend five days of world-class gun training at Front Sight Firearms Training Institute and secure a 30-stake concealed weapon permit, all for pennies on the dollar.
[03:33:58.379 --> 03:34:00.841]  It's like a $4,000 course for $1,100.

[03:34:40.110 --> 03:34:41.931]  This is the name of storable foods.
[03:34:41.931 --> 03:34:46.494]  High quality, non-GMO, non-hybrid, clean, good, quality food.

[03:34:48.896 --> 03:34:50.677]  Guaranteed 10 years in climate control.
[03:34:50.677 --> 03:34:53.459]  This was recently produced in like the last few weeks.
[03:34:53.459 --> 03:34:54.339]  It's all fresh.
[03:34:54.339 --> 03:34:56.440]  They have their own factory, their own food supply.
[03:34:56.440 --> 03:34:57.921]  This is the big trusted name.
[03:34:57.921 --> 03:35:01.924]  There's a lot of other people out there selling crud from 10 years ago out there.
[03:35:01.924 --> 03:35:03.365]  eFoodsDirect.com.

[03:35:21.281 --> 03:35:24.484]  Okay, going back to your phone calls here quickly.
[03:35:24.484 --> 03:35:28.407]  Steve in Chicago, you're on the air with Alan Watt.
[03:35:28.407 --> 03:35:35.313]  Yes, Alex, you're always talking about gibbering, but you never talk about prattling and dribbling, and specifically double dribbling.
[03:35:35.313 --> 03:35:36.754]  And watch Seamus on you.
[03:35:38.053 --> 03:35:39.124]  First of all, what?
[03:35:39.502 --> 03:35:41.704]  There's no such thing in the Scottish newspapers.
[03:35:41.704 --> 03:35:43.065]  I read the Scotsman regularly.
[03:35:43.065 --> 03:35:45.606]  You're talking about Alan Watt.
[03:35:45.606 --> 03:35:46.567]  Hold on just a minute.
[03:35:46.567 --> 03:35:47.568]  Put Steve on hold.
[03:35:47.568 --> 03:35:49.289]  Steve always calls up.
[03:35:49.289 --> 03:35:53.852]  I recognize the caller and sometimes says good things, sometimes says really strange things.
[03:35:53.852 --> 03:35:58.636]  Alan Watt, everything he's talked about today is on his website, coverthematrix.com.
[03:35:58.636 --> 03:36:02.759]  Almost everything he discusses I've read out of these Globalist-owned books.
[03:36:02.759 --> 03:36:05.040]  Alan Watt is a great source of info.
[03:36:05.040 --> 03:36:08.263]  I demand, or I'm hanging up on you Steve, you specifically
[03:36:08.863 --> 03:36:15.149]  Call Alan out on what you're saying he's lying about, or what is not in the Scottish newspapers.
[03:36:15.149 --> 03:36:15.789]  Come on!
[03:36:15.789 --> 03:36:17.691]  Tell me right now, Steve!
[03:36:17.691 --> 03:36:23.496]  I'm talking specifically about the Scotsman newspaper, and I'm talking about his Chemtrail article.
[03:36:23.496 --> 03:36:25.979]  But I've got a couple of interesting facts.
[03:36:25.979 --> 03:36:27.360]  You'd ask about James Van Bruggen.
[03:36:27.768 --> 03:36:40.578]  He's distant cousin of Count von Stauffenberg, because the families intermarried in the 1400s, and secondly, he's descended from German bishops, and the German bishops... You know what I'm talking about about Germans?
[03:36:40.578 --> 03:36:42.219]  We're not talking about Germans.
[03:36:42.219 --> 03:36:43.681]  I'm part German myself.
[03:36:43.681 --> 03:36:45.662]  We're talking about von Brun being a federal plant.
[03:36:45.662 --> 03:36:46.243]  Now listen to me!
[03:36:46.863 --> 03:36:49.504]  Chemtrails are in the Wall Street Journal.
[03:36:49.504 --> 03:36:50.844]  They're all over the British News.
[03:36:50.844 --> 03:36:58.506]  They're telling you how they're going to terraform for your own safety to fix the global warming when the climatologists we talked to say it'll heat the earth up.
[03:36:58.506 --> 03:36:59.726]  Here's the Wall Street Journal.
[03:36:59.726 --> 03:37:01.747]  It's time to cool the planet.
[03:37:01.747 --> 03:37:03.447]  And they say with chemtrailing.
[03:37:03.447 --> 03:37:07.308]  So I'm saying to you, hey, you know what?
[03:37:07.308 --> 03:37:08.048]  Put him on hold.
[03:37:08.048 --> 03:37:09.529]  Alan, go ahead.
[03:37:09.529 --> 03:37:13.209]  I bet from memory you can even tell him the article or pull it up.
[03:37:13.209 --> 03:37:15.150]  Specifically, what were you saying out of the Scotsman?
[03:37:15.868 --> 03:37:25.586]  Yeah, the Scottish, not just the Scotsman, it was all over the Scottish papers, this mysterious gel, they're calling it, found over Highland areas, and they brought in all the different
[03:37:27.326 --> 03:37:28.967]  I don't understand this.
[03:37:28.967 --> 03:37:30.368]  We're here trying to do a good job.
[03:37:30.368 --> 03:37:32.629]  They're all over the news admitting, all over England, headlines.
[03:37:49.637 --> 03:37:52.019]  Plague bombs released over Scotland.
[03:37:52.019 --> 03:37:56.741]  Another headline, all of England sprayed with chemicals and biologicals in tests.
[03:37:56.741 --> 03:37:58.522]  It's all in my film, Endgame.
[03:37:58.522 --> 03:38:00.644]  I mean, he's... I mean, we're telling the truth.
[03:38:00.644 --> 03:38:09.429]  Well, you've got to understand, though, Alex, there are people out there that are in their own little Plato's cave, and all they'll do is attack and smear.
[03:38:09.429 --> 03:38:11.290]  It doesn't matter how much proof you give them.
[03:38:11.290 --> 03:38:12.491]  It doesn't make any difference.
[03:38:12.491 --> 03:38:17.934]  They have their own little agendas, and you can't get into their headspace because it's their personal little private place.
[03:38:20.259 --> 03:38:23.500]  Oh, there is the Jelly Mystery BBC.
[03:38:23.500 --> 03:38:24.920]  Let's click on that.
[03:38:24.920 --> 03:38:29.241]  Oh, we don't make anything up here.
[03:38:29.241 --> 03:38:34.701]  You know, I don't understand, Alan, how we're at a higher standard than the New World Order always engaging in their activities.
[03:38:34.701 --> 03:38:36.562]  I mean, why are we bad?
[03:38:36.562 --> 03:38:41.163]  Is it the psychology of kind of like crabs not wanting other crabs to get out of a bucket?
[03:38:41.163 --> 03:38:42.163]  I think so.
[03:38:42.163 --> 03:38:48.544]  It's also that a lot of people out there want to live in utter denial because they just don't like you or what you're saying.
[03:38:48.544 --> 03:38:49.524]  It's as simple as that.
[03:38:50.199 --> 03:38:51.920]  Hi.
[03:38:51.920 --> 03:38:55.503]  Scott, we just googled mysterious gel in Scotland.
[03:38:55.503 --> 03:38:59.807]  Our internet is so lightning slow that it's not even loading yet, but there it all is.
[03:38:59.807 --> 03:39:06.612]  All over the news about mysterious substance gel falling from the sky.
[03:39:06.612 --> 03:39:08.093]  So what do you say to that, Steve?
[03:39:08.093 --> 03:39:10.295]  We're still liars?
[03:39:10.295 --> 03:39:11.176]  Certainly.
[03:39:11.176 --> 03:39:14.158]  He's James Bondage, MI6 control officer.
[03:39:14.158 --> 03:39:17.821]  Or he's either John Bullcrap, MI6 chaos agent.
[03:39:17.821 --> 03:39:19.903]  Because the story is that everybody knows
[03:39:20.444 --> 03:39:28.991]  That the stories from the BBC and the Daily Mail never make it in the Scottish newspapers because it's all propaganda.
[03:39:28.991 --> 03:39:31.133]  What the hell?
[03:39:31.133 --> 03:39:32.114]  We're done with you.
[03:39:32.114 --> 03:39:32.774]  We're done with you.
[03:39:32.774 --> 03:39:34.976]  You make up one lie and you make up another.
[03:39:37.819 --> 03:39:39.500]  I just don't understand the mental illness, man.
[03:39:39.500 --> 03:39:39.720]  What?
[03:39:39.720 --> 03:39:41.421]  I didn't do anything to you, brother.
[03:39:41.421 --> 03:39:45.003]  You were talking about chemical and biological testing.
[03:39:45.003 --> 03:39:47.125]  Google this for everybody.
[03:39:47.125 --> 03:39:48.485]  Guys, and print me that while you're at it.
[03:39:48.485 --> 03:39:52.268]  I want to show the viewers this.
[03:39:52.268 --> 03:39:57.951]  Because one of the big ones that got a lot of attention was Subtilis Globally sprayed over Oklahoma.
[03:39:57.951 --> 03:39:59.532]  Subtilis Globogy.
[03:40:00.794 --> 03:40:02.234]  Yes, and this stuff has been tested before.
[03:40:02.234 --> 03:40:04.815]  Espanola and Ontario was the target.
[03:40:04.815 --> 03:40:05.275]  The U.S.
[03:40:05.275 --> 03:40:07.456]  planes were given permission to do it over that area.
[03:40:28.413 --> 03:40:30.314]  Well, I mean, I don't know what to do for people anymore.
[03:40:55.134 --> 03:41:03.421]  They've all got their little niche group, and if you hear them... I just want to get people fighting New World Order.
[03:41:03.421 --> 03:41:07.104]  I want them to stop all the chemical biological testing.
[03:41:07.104 --> 03:41:16.271]  I've actually had people, you've probably found this too, that have accused me of being a spy because I shouldn't know as much as I do.
[03:41:16.271 --> 03:41:20.895]  One guy actually wrote to me and he says, why were you in libraries when you were a child studying this stuff?
[03:41:21.860 --> 03:41:28.901]  So anything that's beyond themselves or outside of what they were up to, you must be a strange, weird, special kind.
[03:41:28.901 --> 03:41:29.542]  No, I know.
[03:41:29.542 --> 03:41:32.582]  I had psychology today asking me how I got into all this.
[03:41:32.582 --> 03:41:35.203]  And I said, well, I started reading a lot of history books when I was a kid.
[03:41:35.203 --> 03:41:40.244]  They're like, how strange, how weird, how... And I was like, well, no, it was actually very entertaining.
[03:41:40.244 --> 03:41:42.724]  I was doing it for entertainment at the time.
[03:41:42.724 --> 03:41:46.445]  It was a lot better than Pulp Fiction or Louis L'Amour books I was reading.
[03:41:46.445 --> 03:41:50.606]  And they were just like, hmm, how... And then if you're ever at a...
[03:41:51.306 --> 03:42:11.183]  I was at a Target buying some t-shirts a few weeks ago because I've lost some weight so I had to get some smaller clothes and I went over to the video section and got downfall about Hitler which I'd seen in the theaters very very accurate about him in the bunker and the guy kind of freaked out at the checkout counter and was looking at me and like had it and going
[03:42:12.056 --> 03:42:14.937]  Because he saw Hitler, it meant I was with Hitler.
[03:42:14.937 --> 03:42:22.941]  And I remember when I was a teenager, I bought my comp to read what Hitler had said, and the lady asked me if I was a white supremacist and was very upset.
[03:42:22.941 --> 03:42:25.302]  I said, why are you selling it, lady?
[03:42:25.302 --> 03:42:26.983]  No, I'm reading it for history.
[03:42:26.983 --> 03:42:29.724]  I've read a book by Julius Caesar.
[03:42:29.724 --> 03:42:31.085]  I've read books by Shakespeare.
[03:42:31.085 --> 03:42:32.486]  It doesn't mean I'm Shakespeare either.
[03:42:33.266 --> 03:42:37.489]  You know, they say, uh, people have seen videos of me with a Sprint telephone.
[03:42:37.489 --> 03:42:39.891]  They say I'm, oh God, we blew up the video.
[03:42:39.891 --> 03:42:40.551]  It's Sprint.
[03:42:40.551 --> 03:42:41.972]  He works for Sprint.
[03:42:41.972 --> 03:42:46.175]  Or, there's actually sites saying I have a Neumann microphone.
[03:42:46.175 --> 03:42:47.396]  That means I'm a Nazi.
[03:42:47.396 --> 03:42:51.278]  Because Hitler had, at speeches, had Neumann microphones.
[03:42:51.278 --> 03:42:53.020]  It's proof I'm with Hitler.
[03:42:53.020 --> 03:42:54.881]  I mean, you know, it's mental illness.
[03:42:54.881 --> 03:42:58.844]  There's all this real stuff happening, but they can't deal with any of that.
[03:42:58.844 --> 03:43:00.485]  They gotta make it us, Alan.
[03:43:00.485 --> 03:43:02.046]  We're, we're, we're, we're what's bad.
[03:43:02.771 --> 03:43:03.772]  That's correct.
[03:43:03.772 --> 03:43:05.633]  And those people you have to simply dismiss.
[03:43:05.633 --> 03:43:09.395]  I've actually had one woman say, people like you scare me.
[03:43:09.395 --> 03:43:10.816]  I said, well, why?
[03:43:10.816 --> 03:43:12.457]  You're too intelligent.
[03:43:12.457 --> 03:43:13.717]  She says, you remember everything.
[03:43:13.717 --> 03:43:16.339]  I don't remember anything, she said.
[03:43:16.339 --> 03:43:17.860]  Well, that's not my fault.
[03:43:17.860 --> 03:43:18.700]  That's not my fault.
[03:43:18.700 --> 03:43:20.681]  She can't remember anything.
[03:43:20.681 --> 03:43:28.286]  But you've got to simply dismiss these people because if you use your intellect, they're paranoid about you.
[03:43:28.286 --> 03:43:30.187]  These people live in TV land.
[03:43:31.078 --> 03:43:32.479]  That's where all the stuff comes from.
[03:43:32.479 --> 03:43:38.162]  They live in fiction most of the time, or in sports, or in dramas, or soaps, or cop shows.
[03:43:38.162 --> 03:43:42.204]  And really, they're suspicious of you because you're different.
[03:43:42.204 --> 03:43:43.805]  You want to know what's going on.
[03:43:43.805 --> 03:43:45.366]  They've decided not to.
[03:43:46.308 --> 03:43:47.589]  Well, I mean, take Henry Rollins.
[03:43:47.589 --> 03:43:53.732]  He was reading a neocon book that was pro-war, if memory serves, but it said something about terror.
[03:43:53.732 --> 03:43:55.033]  I think it was Simon & Schuster.
[03:43:55.033 --> 03:43:56.294]  It was a best-selling book.
[03:43:56.294 --> 03:43:58.095]  He's on an airplane from Australia.
[03:43:58.095 --> 03:44:02.417]  They went ahead and took his book and arrested him, and they said, you're not allowed to read books.
[03:44:02.417 --> 03:44:05.999]  I mean, I've seen people, when I'm reading a book, they come over and go, what are you reading?
[03:44:05.999 --> 03:44:06.620]  You're reading?
[03:44:06.620 --> 03:44:13.123]  It's almost like, you know, like the Monty Python joke of, look, this one knows how to speak, or this one knows how to read.
[03:44:13.123 --> 03:44:15.705]  It's like, my God, he, you know.
[03:44:16.325 --> 03:44:17.405]  Here it is!
[03:44:17.405 --> 03:44:22.828]  K-O-C-O, bioterrorism test, scheduled over central Oklahoma.
[03:44:22.828 --> 03:44:24.389]  Click on that one.
[03:44:24.389 --> 03:44:25.589]  And there's a bunch of other news.
[03:44:25.589 --> 03:44:29.691]  I don't know if this is the Subtelus Globogy story.
[03:44:29.691 --> 03:44:35.313]  But, uh... Goldsby selected for bioterrorism drill.
[03:44:35.313 --> 03:44:37.034]  I mean, they do it everywhere.
[03:44:37.034 --> 03:44:40.416]  But after you're done showing that, Google this.
[03:44:40.416 --> 03:44:42.997]  Plague bombs tested over Scotland.
[03:44:45.024 --> 03:44:46.825]  That's the way the logic runs, yeah.
[03:45:12.489 --> 03:45:15.530]  Bioterrorism test scheduled over Central Oklahoma.
[03:45:15.530 --> 03:45:18.731]  Materials simulating chemical threat to be dropped on areas.
[03:45:18.731 --> 03:45:20.871]  That's 2003.
[03:45:20.871 --> 03:45:22.071]  Print me that.
[03:45:22.071 --> 03:45:38.816]  Oh, it said, chemicals to simulate, but then it says, bacillus throningenesius, B-T, but then when you go on to read, it was another one, it turned out to be a whole group of bacteria which cause spontaneous abortion.
[03:45:38.816 --> 03:45:39.416]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[03:45:41.142 --> 03:45:41.942]  It's astonishing.
[03:45:41.942 --> 03:45:43.964]  There's no lack of data.
[03:45:43.964 --> 03:45:53.252]  There's even mainstream TV articles on the yellow stuff that's come down in some areas of the U.S.
[03:45:53.252 --> 03:45:59.297]  and it was tested by the TV people and it was cadmium and aluminum oxide.
[03:45:59.861 --> 03:46:00.582]  Listen, we had, we had
[03:46:21.747 --> 03:46:41.174]  In Belton, and other places, people who didn't believe, saying black helicopters would fly over with spray bottles and spray people, and then Mike Hansen was doing construction work one day on a hilltop and watched a helicopter fly over and spray a schoolyard, and then it was on the news, everybody was collapsing without even knowing about the helicopters.
[03:46:41.174 --> 03:46:43.275]  The hospitals were filled with people.
[03:46:43.275 --> 03:46:46.956]  I mean, this is going on here, and we even film it!
[03:46:46.956 --> 03:46:50.758]  But, you know what, that guy was engaged in double, triple, quadruple, think,
[03:46:52.000 --> 03:46:58.743]  He said that you were basically lying about the gel, and then when it was BBC, he said, well, that's British propaganda.
[03:46:58.743 --> 03:46:59.884]  The Scots don't lie.
[03:46:59.884 --> 03:47:03.966]  So I want you guys to search... What was the headline?
[03:47:03.966 --> 03:47:05.847]  You were saying something mysterious gel?
[03:47:05.847 --> 03:47:07.207]  Or mystery gel Scotland?
[03:47:07.207 --> 03:47:08.848]  That's right.
[03:47:08.848 --> 03:47:09.409]  Oh, there it is.
[03:47:09.409 --> 03:47:11.790]  Nazis tested crude atomic bomb before end of war.
[03:47:11.790 --> 03:47:14.171]  No, that's the Scotsman.
[03:47:14.171 --> 03:47:15.992]  It was plague bombs.
[03:47:15.992 --> 03:47:19.073]  Plague bombs tested over Scotland is what I want.
[03:47:19.073 --> 03:47:20.174]  Plague bombs.
[03:47:21.109 --> 03:47:22.570]  Now you're going to get the headline.
[03:47:22.570 --> 03:47:24.151]  We've got to show these people.
[03:47:24.151 --> 03:47:25.592]  People wonder how I get these articles.
[03:47:25.592 --> 03:47:26.932]  They go, you must be an agent.
[03:47:26.932 --> 03:47:31.135]  Well, I see I put the word in and I look at it.
[03:47:31.135 --> 03:47:35.837]  How naval intelligence tested lethal plague bombs in Scotland.
[03:47:35.837 --> 03:47:38.339]  That's find articles.
[03:47:38.339 --> 03:47:41.260]  Listen, here's the one I want for everybody out there.
[03:47:41.260 --> 03:47:45.643]  I want to show him Scotsman Mysterious Jail Scotland.
[03:47:45.643 --> 03:47:48.885]  Scotsman.com Mysterious Jail Scotland.
[03:47:49.690 --> 03:47:52.232]  And then we'll show him this and he won't be able to compute.
[03:47:52.232 --> 03:48:02.958]  He'll just go, Vatican, agent, Zionist, agent, devil agent, devil agent, Illuminati, Illuminati, he's bad, he doesn't want them testing on me, he's with them, he's with them.
[03:48:02.958 --> 03:48:08.221]  Because again, they don't want to see someone making them face the tyranny and then warn others.
[03:48:08.221 --> 03:48:16.386]  It's all about also being an elitist in the conspiracy slash patriot movement going, only I understand, everyone else is an agent, no one's good.
[03:48:16.386 --> 03:48:17.607]  What do you call that mental illness?
[03:48:21.920 --> 03:48:23.061]  Well, it's just insane.
[03:48:23.061 --> 03:48:28.124]  All I'm trying to do is save my family here.
[03:48:28.124 --> 03:48:28.725]  Here it is.
[03:48:28.725 --> 03:48:30.166]  This is another BBC.
[03:48:30.166 --> 03:48:33.428]  I'm going to find it.
[03:48:33.428 --> 03:48:34.829]  Do Scotsman.com.
[03:48:34.829 --> 03:48:40.374]  You've got to put Scotsman.com after the Scotsman right there to find it.
[03:48:40.374 --> 03:48:41.635]  That's the way you've got to do that on.
[03:48:42.598 --> 03:48:44.381]  I'm sorry, Alan, I'm out of control today.
[03:48:44.381 --> 03:48:49.327]  That's Scotsman.com, probably the secret code for MI6 agents.
[03:48:49.327 --> 03:48:51.190]  Exactly.
[03:48:51.190 --> 03:48:53.453]  The MI6 agents are actually attacking us.
[03:48:53.453 --> 03:48:55.516]  I got attacked by the BBC yesterday, by the way.
[03:49:00.967 --> 03:49:03.509]  There's a Scotsman mentioning it, but it's its main page.
[03:49:03.509 --> 03:49:05.450]  I'm gonna find that and put it up there for him.
[03:49:05.450 --> 03:49:06.731]  He won't know what to do, though, about it.
[03:49:06.731 --> 03:49:13.537]  But see, it all becomes the mental illness of showing it that's in the Scotsman, instead of the fact that there's this mysterious jelly being sprayed everywhere.
[03:49:13.537 --> 03:49:17.400]  Gary in Texas, go ahead.
[03:49:17.400 --> 03:49:18.341]  What?
[03:49:18.341 --> 03:49:20.022]  Go ahead, Gary.
[03:49:20.022 --> 03:49:21.523]  Hey, Alex, what's going on?
[03:49:21.523 --> 03:49:22.584]  We're on the air worldwide.
[03:49:24.780 --> 03:49:34.546]  I just wanted to touch real quick on this climate bill and Obama real quick if I could because some of the responses I get from people when I tell them the
[03:49:35.444 --> 03:49:43.928]  Direct quotes from what he ran in his campaign to what he says on the issues now, and... Yeah, I was gonna do that today.
[03:49:43.928 --> 03:49:47.890]  I've got five videos of him saying he will not do any signing statements.
[03:49:47.890 --> 03:49:54.993]  I got four or five videos where he says he will not raise any taxes but $250,000 or above, and now he's saying, I never said that.
[03:49:54.993 --> 03:49:56.874]  And the Obama people go, he never said that.
[03:49:56.874 --> 03:49:58.175]  Shut up!
[03:49:58.175 --> 03:50:00.896]  Go ahead.
[03:50:00.896 --> 03:50:02.937]  And the response I get
[03:50:04.110 --> 03:50:04.970]  Oh, he's great.
[03:50:04.970 --> 03:50:07.151]  He's going to be great for the country.
[03:50:07.151 --> 03:50:15.673]  And the biggest thing is he shows how far society has come for civil rights issues.
[03:50:15.673 --> 03:50:22.534]  No, he's got dark skin so he can double the eugenics on the blacks.
[03:50:22.534 --> 03:50:25.035]  He's here to bring death to Africa and Afrikan.
[03:50:25.035 --> 03:50:27.035]  Let's get a comment from Alan Watt on that.
[03:50:27.756 --> 03:50:40.021]  Well I'd say that committee they set up for comparative effectiveness in health care is a vast reduction of health care when you really look into what they're on about is taking away your health care.
[03:50:40.021 --> 03:50:40.901]  That's where they hit the poorest
[03:50:42.304 --> 03:50:43.185]  Yeah, Gary, stay there.
[03:50:43.185 --> 03:50:45.488]  I'll let you finish up your point real quick, and we'll take a few final calls.
[03:50:45.488 --> 03:50:46.950]  Jonathan and Tatina.
[03:50:46.950 --> 03:50:48.352]  I want to get to at least three calls on the other side.
[03:50:48.352 --> 03:50:53.138]  Alan Watt, an amazing interview, shaping up to be two hour, 50 minutes long.
[03:50:53.138 --> 03:50:56.062]  PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com are the sites.
[03:50:56.062 --> 03:50:57.183]  Get my film in, gang.
[03:50:57.183 --> 03:50:58.826]  Get it out to everybody.
[03:50:58.826 --> 03:51:00.207]  Deprogram the slaves.
[03:51:01.633 --> 03:51:04.734]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap, or detergent?
[03:51:04.734 --> 03:51:10.236]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfates, sodium, formaldehydes, and more?
[03:51:10.236 --> 03:51:15.958]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which are synthetic.
[03:51:15.958 --> 03:51:17.439]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[03:51:17.439 --> 03:51:26.342]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin, and mucous membranes.
[03:51:26.762 --> 03:51:28.604]  Now compare a Calben Pure Soap.

[03:52:02.023 --> 03:52:08.068]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[03:52:08.068 --> 03:52:13.933]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[03:52:13.933 --> 03:52:20.438]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people.
[03:52:20.438 --> 03:52:22.420]  Well, Obama's already fudging.
[03:52:22.420 --> 03:52:24.882]  He's fudged since day one in this election.
[03:52:24.882 --> 03:52:28.865]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists,
[03:52:29.165 --> 03:52:35.091]  Who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs.
[03:52:35.091 --> 03:52:38.054]  That's fascism.
[03:52:38.054 --> 03:52:39.736]  It's not about left or right.
[03:52:39.736 --> 03:52:41.578]  It's about a one world government.
[03:52:41.578 --> 03:52:47.804]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[03:52:48.490 --> 03:52:56.754]  Get your copy of The Obama Deception today at InfoWars.com or download it in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:52:56.754 --> 03:52:58.315]  The Obama Deception.
[03:52:58.315 --> 03:53:01.056]  The people strike back.
[03:53:01.056 --> 03:53:03.838]  The phone rings and the questions are asked.
[03:53:03.838 --> 03:53:05.098]  I've been so sick.
[03:53:05.098 --> 03:53:06.779]  Will the life change tea help me?
[03:53:06.779 --> 03:53:08.160]  Our answer is always the same.
[03:53:08.618 --> 03:53:14.740]  Yes, toxins and chemicals from food, water, and air are attacking you this very moment.
[03:53:14.740 --> 03:53:20.641]  Fight back with our all-natural detoxifying tea that works immediately.
[03:53:20.641 --> 03:53:25.142]  Many companies use gimmicks and misleading free trials for their campaign.
[03:53:25.142 --> 03:53:26.563]  We use results.
[03:53:26.563 --> 03:53:31.324]  Life Change Tea's formula created by a PhD has been around for over 20 years.
[03:53:31.324 --> 03:53:35.585]  There are things happening in the world that are unseen and not healthy.
[03:53:35.925 --> 03:53:39.786]  The public has reached its all-time record for chronic sickness.
[03:53:39.786 --> 03:53:43.687]  This atrocity won't change unless you call us right now.
[03:53:43.687 --> 03:53:48.628]  Our number is 9-2-8-3-0-8-0-4-0-8.
[03:53:48.628 --> 03:53:51.649]  Again, that's 9-2-8-3-0-8-0-4-0-8.
[03:53:51.649 --> 03:53:55.390]  Or you can order online at GetTheTee.com.
[03:53:55.390 --> 03:53:57.930]  That's GetTheTee.com.
[03:53:57.930 --> 03:54:00.531]  And remember, we have the cheapest shipping in the industry.
[03:54:18.171 --> 03:54:19.772]  You know, I meant to get to this days ago.
[03:54:19.772 --> 03:54:25.095]  Portugal, Switzerland, a bunch of other countries now won't accept U.S.
[03:54:25.095 --> 03:54:29.678]  customers, UBS and others, because our government's stealing everybody's bank accounts.
[03:54:29.678 --> 03:54:33.360]  Then the big trillion dollar and billion dollar slush funds, those are all left alone.
[03:54:33.360 --> 03:54:41.425]  This is all part of the OECD, global tax avoidance, the total grid going in, and we are known as the slave suckers of the planet.
[03:54:41.425 --> 03:54:45.268]  The Chinese and the American people are the different beta test, so are the Brits.
[03:54:46.088 --> 03:54:47.309]  Finishing up, Gary.
[03:54:47.309 --> 03:54:51.852]  Yeah, Obama has lied about everything, except his promise to set up youth corps.
[03:54:51.852 --> 03:54:53.853]  And he's keeping troops in Iraq.
[03:54:53.853 --> 03:54:57.475]  That's all a staged deal, pulling some out of a few cities.
[03:54:57.475 --> 03:54:59.536]  But very, very serious.
[03:54:59.536 --> 03:55:01.318]  Anything else?
[03:55:01.318 --> 03:55:05.660]  Just on the climate bill that just went through the House as a vote.
[03:55:05.660 --> 03:55:09.743]  After your show, I watched the C-SPAN coverage of it.
[03:55:09.743 --> 03:55:14.606]  And none of them, the Democrats didn't even have a legitimate claim for this bill.
[03:55:16.021 --> 03:55:17.803]  Well, of course they don't want to be legitimate.
[03:55:17.803 --> 03:55:19.485]  I appreciate your call.
[03:55:19.485 --> 03:55:22.108]  Yeah, the global climate situation.
[03:55:22.108 --> 03:55:24.711]  What's that all about, Alan Watt?
[03:55:24.711 --> 03:55:26.853]  Again, it just prepares for propaganda.
[03:55:26.853 --> 03:55:28.315]  They don't even need facts.
[03:55:28.315 --> 03:55:30.838]  They hope to win just by the propaganda.
[03:55:30.838 --> 03:55:36.324]  Because the average person cannot believe that so many people would go to such extreme lengths to lie to them.
[03:55:37.112 --> 03:55:39.055]  That's how we think as ordinary people.
[03:55:39.055 --> 03:55:40.317]  Remember, Hilgar said the same thing.
[03:55:40.317 --> 03:55:42.460]  If you're going to tell a lie, make sure it's a big lie.
[03:55:42.460 --> 03:55:44.142]  They're more likely to believe it.
[03:55:44.142 --> 03:55:45.564]  And this is what they're using today.
[03:55:45.564 --> 03:55:47.507]  Repetition, repetition, repetition.
[03:55:47.507 --> 03:55:49.850]  Selective scientists who are all on IPPC.
[03:55:52.745 --> 03:56:00.132]  Those scientists who come out with other facts, contradictory data, are being barred from world meetings or even from getting talks.
[03:56:00.132 --> 03:56:02.214]  Hell, they're trying to make it illegal!
[03:56:02.214 --> 03:56:03.275]  Yes, they are.
[03:56:03.275 --> 03:56:04.856]  Climate denial!
[03:56:04.856 --> 03:56:07.138]  Let's talk to Tatiana in California.
[03:56:07.138 --> 03:56:08.880]  Go ahead, Tatiana.
[03:56:08.880 --> 03:56:10.201]  Sorry, I was calling you Titania.
[03:56:10.201 --> 03:56:12.643]  I was reading way across the... It's okay.
[03:56:12.643 --> 03:56:13.284]  It's alright.
[03:56:13.284 --> 03:56:14.345]  People do make mistakes.
[03:56:15.307 --> 03:56:16.287]  Alex, hi.
[03:56:16.287 --> 03:56:19.068]  I just wanted to thank you for what you're doing.
[03:56:19.068 --> 03:56:23.609]  And I have actually a comment about one of your shows you did a few days ago.
[03:56:23.609 --> 03:56:24.870]  Yeah.
[03:56:24.870 --> 03:56:26.330]  On this federal offense.
[03:56:26.330 --> 03:56:31.551]  If somebody says something you don't like, they can actually sue you or whatever.
[03:56:31.551 --> 03:56:33.552]  No, not sue you.
[03:56:33.552 --> 03:56:34.052]  Arrest you.
[03:56:34.052 --> 03:56:36.933]  The Cyberbullying and the Hate Crimes Act.
[03:56:36.933 --> 03:56:38.433]  The Hate Crimes Act has passed.
[03:56:38.433 --> 03:56:41.134]  And it says if you hurt someone's feelings, you're going to federal prison.
[03:56:42.150 --> 03:56:47.733]  Okay, well my other question is, if it's a log, isn't it a double-edged sword?
[03:56:47.733 --> 03:56:49.554]  We can use that against them?
[03:56:49.554 --> 03:56:51.376]  No, no, it's all selectively enforced.
[03:56:51.376 --> 03:56:56.118]  It's all like when the cops beat a guy to death in England and it comes out they even killed him.
[03:56:56.118 --> 03:56:57.960]  They get awards.
[03:56:57.960 --> 03:57:04.804]  Just like when the army recruiters lie and say you'll go to prison if you don't join the military when you haven't signed.
[03:57:04.804 --> 03:57:05.924]  They get promoted.
[03:57:05.924 --> 03:57:06.905]  Alan, you want to explain that?
[03:57:07.850 --> 03:57:09.291]  Yes, that's the technique they're using.
[03:57:09.291 --> 03:57:13.253]  They make it sound as though everything is equal, we all get equal chances.
[03:57:13.253 --> 03:57:21.997]  But when you look at the United Nations, for instance, they decide which NGOs they will have on board and which ones they will not, which ones are taboo.
[03:57:21.997 --> 03:57:24.578]  So it's selective across the board.
[03:57:24.578 --> 03:57:28.200]  Yeah, that's like the United Nations, Tatiana, in Rwanda.
[03:57:28.200 --> 03:57:30.521]  It came out, they really ran that mass murder.
[03:57:30.521 --> 03:57:34.043]  But then they run the trial, punishing a few machete wielders.
[03:57:37.486 --> 03:57:39.430]  Anything else, Tatiana?
[03:57:39.430 --> 03:57:44.418]  Well, my question was, isn't the law a double-edged sword?
[03:57:44.418 --> 03:57:47.083]  Basically, can't we use the same law against them?
[03:57:47.731 --> 03:57:51.132]  No, no, because they decide how to apply it.
[03:57:51.132 --> 03:57:52.153]  Selective enforcement.
[03:57:52.153 --> 03:57:53.313]  I appreciate your call.
[03:57:53.313 --> 03:57:55.274]  We're out of time for Jordan and others.
[03:57:55.274 --> 03:57:59.416]  Always amazing having you on, Alan Watt, today for two hours and 15 minutes.
[03:57:59.416 --> 03:58:00.716]  CutIntoTheMatrix.com.
[03:58:00.716 --> 03:58:03.718]  Our sites are PrisonPlanet.com and InfoWars.com.
[03:58:03.718 --> 03:58:05.678]  Alan, super job.
[03:58:05.678 --> 03:58:10.580]  We've got some special projects coming up in the future, and I'm really honored to work with you, Alan.
[03:58:10.580 --> 03:58:11.921]  Thanks, I appreciate being on.
[03:58:12.571 --> 03:58:14.652]  Let me say bye to you when the show ends, my friend.
[03:58:14.652 --> 03:58:18.414]  Okay, we are out of time here, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:58:18.414 --> 03:58:23.797]  Retransmission starts now at InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[03:58:23.797 --> 03:58:28.700]  Don't forget all the books, all the videos, all the materials available at InfoWars.com.
[03:58:28.700 --> 03:58:30.341]  Get them, make copies, get them out to people.
[03:58:30.341 --> 03:58:38.025]  Resist, speak up, take action, get your head screwed on straight, trust in God, and take on the new old order.
[03:58:38.025 --> 03:58:39.886]  Key info on foreign troops in the U.S.
[03:58:39.886 --> 03:58:40.987]  coming up right now on the other side.
[03:58:40.987 --> 03:58:41.447]  Good job, crew.
[03:58:43.027 --> 03:58:46.669]  You are listening to GCN.
[03:58:46.669 --> 03:58:51.472]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[03:58:51.472 --> 03:58:52.113]  Hello, friends.
[03:58:52.113 --> 03:58:53.173]  This is Alex Jones.
[03:58:53.173 --> 03:58:57.916]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient, and today that's more important than ever.
[03:58:57.916 --> 03:59:00.878]  We need to be independent, and food and water is the key.
[03:59:00.878 --> 03:59:03.920]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line if you have your own bread.
[03:59:03.920 --> 03:59:08.643]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family in any emergency.
[03:59:08.863 --> 03:59:09.983]  If you simply prepare.
[03:59:09.983 --> 03:59:13.225]  No one is going to take care of your family in the final equation but you.
[03:59:13.225 --> 03:59:20.207]  You know eFoodsDirect.com is still able to ship storable food that's safe from E. Coli, Salmonella, genetic alteration or Chinese imports.
[03:59:20.207 --> 03:59:23.488]  And they do it at almost half the cost of last year's grocery prices.
