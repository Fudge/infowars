[00:00.000 --> 00:09.680]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:09.680 --> 00:11.180]  You want answers?
[00:11.180 --> 00:12.800]  Well, so does he.
[00:12.800 --> 00:34.640]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:34.640 --> 00:38.320]  Well, here we are, more than halfway into 2009.
[00:38.320 --> 00:42.920]  It is Wednesday, July 1, 2009.
[00:42.920 --> 00:47.520]  We have four hours spanning out before us today.
[00:47.520 --> 00:52.840]  We are going to have wide open phones throughout the full four hours of transmission on any
[00:52.840 --> 01:03.360]  subject, any news item, any story you wish to discuss, any question you have for me, 1-800-259-9231-1800.
[01:03.360 --> 01:21.600]  Where to begin, we have Alan Watt joining us for two hours today, coming up in the second
[01:21.600 --> 01:24.040]  and third hour, maybe even longer.
[01:24.040 --> 01:28.200]  We will open the phones up during that interview, and I'm going to try to sit back and let Alan
[01:28.200 --> 01:33.280]  really roll with just a few of my key questions throughout it that's always informative to
[01:33.280 --> 01:41.000]  have Alan on with us, so that is, coming up in T-minus 59 minutes.
[01:41.000 --> 01:47.040]  On other fronts, because I just don't want to mention this and then have it kind of glazed
[01:47.040 --> 01:53.880]  over in the background chatter of the other important news I'm covering, we have discovered
[01:53.880 --> 02:01.360]  clear black operations going on against this office specifically.
[02:01.360 --> 02:05.080]  And I think long-time listeners especially know we don't just come on here and say things.
[02:05.080 --> 02:11.440]  If we say something, it is almost always accurate and true, and if not the few times we're wrong,
[02:11.440 --> 02:14.600]  we believe it is accurate and true.
[02:14.600 --> 02:20.000]  But I have confirmed from multiple sources over multiple angles and over my almost 14
[02:20.000 --> 02:25.520]  years in the media on the air as an activist, more than 14 years as an activist, really
[02:25.520 --> 02:29.280]  15 as an activist, but close to 14 on air.
[02:29.280 --> 02:32.880]  I've discovered systems, patterns, also a lot of declassified government documents, how
[02:32.880 --> 02:38.240]  this stuff works, past examples, news stories when it does leak, how different types of
[02:38.240 --> 02:45.720]  black ops work, and the establishment is moving against me on multi fronts right now, and
[02:45.720 --> 02:52.200]  my sixth sense has been an overdrive lately, and I'm somebody who's actually pretty bold,
[02:52.200 --> 02:58.680]  I do have quite a bit of almost stupid courage, if I do so to say so myself, I sleep pretty
[02:58.680 --> 03:03.840]  well at night when it comes to worrying about my own family and myself and my safety.
[03:03.840 --> 03:11.360]  I don't sleep well sometimes, worried about society itself overall and my children's futures.
[03:11.360 --> 03:17.520]  So when my sixth sense starts jumping, and I mean jumping like a bucket and bronco that's
[03:17.520 --> 03:24.200]  been thrown into a squeeze shoot, and then I physically out there in the media and the
[03:24.200 --> 03:30.040]  culture see the enemy on my sixth, not just my sixth sense, but the enemy's on my sixth,
[03:30.040 --> 03:35.120]  that means right behind me for those that I guess don't know dog fighting definitions
[03:35.120 --> 03:41.320]  in nomenclature, that's when you say they're at 12 o'clock, they're at 3 o'clock, they're
[03:41.320 --> 03:47.920]  at 1 o'clock, they're at 9 o'clock, you picture yourself right in the center of the watch dial
[03:47.920 --> 03:52.680]  with the hands sticking out, so 12 o'clock's right out in front of you, so you'd say up
[03:52.680 --> 04:01.920]  into 12 o'clock, or coming in on your sixth from under you, or point is I got all sorts
[04:01.920 --> 04:08.840]  of bogeys on my sixth and they are firing, a lot of them publicly firing on me, but there's
[04:08.840 --> 04:16.120]  a lot of other bogeys we discovered that shake me a bit, but that's good, that's what gets
[04:16.120 --> 04:21.360]  me alive, it's what wakes me up, and I'll tell you it's exciting to know you're in the service
[04:21.360 --> 04:26.320]  of humanity and the creator, it's exciting to know I'm on the side of the good guys,
[04:26.320 --> 04:36.880]  it's exciting to know that I face media demonization, dirty tricks, physical attacks, and ultimately
[04:36.880 --> 04:44.560]  the way the track is going, my death, it is exciting to turn the afterburners on and blast
[04:44.560 --> 04:50.880]  into enemy territory, knowing I'm committed, but I do want to ask for your prayers coming
[04:50.880 --> 04:51.880]  up in about 30 minutes.
[04:51.880 --> 05:00.480]  All right, a lot of key news straight ahead, I'm Alex Jones, this is GCN Radio Network.
[05:00.480 --> 05:04.280]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from the resistant new strains of deadly

[06:00.320 --> 06:03.320]  The new world orders war against humanity.
[06:03.320 --> 06:05.520]  Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[06:05.520 --> 06:12.280]  We've got to have a civilian national security force that's just as powerful, just as strong,
[06:12.280 --> 06:13.600]  just as well funded.
[06:13.600 --> 06:18.760]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[06:18.760 --> 06:20.240]  of the American people.
[06:20.240 --> 06:24.640]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election.
[06:24.640 --> 06:29.760]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[06:29.760 --> 06:36.280]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[06:36.280 --> 06:39.840]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[06:39.840 --> 06:46.760]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.

[06:54.920 --> 06:56.480]  The Obama deception.
[06:56.480 --> 07:00.280]  The people strike back.
[07:00.280 --> 07:03.320]  Hello this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[07:03.320 --> 07:07.680]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition
[07:07.680 --> 07:08.680]  do you want?
[07:08.680 --> 07:10.680]  My answer would be all I can get.
[07:10.680 --> 07:15.720]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[07:15.720 --> 07:16.920]  How much do you want?
[07:16.920 --> 07:17.920]  When do you want it?
[07:17.920 --> 07:19.960]  Now or after the battle starts?
[07:19.960 --> 07:21.080]  When will you need it?
[07:21.080 --> 07:23.200]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[07:23.200 --> 07:24.560]  Will there be any food?
[07:24.560 --> 07:26.000]  Will it make your children sick?
[07:26.000 --> 07:30.160]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center
[07:30.160 --> 07:31.320]  and be immunized?
[07:31.320 --> 07:35.080]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[07:35.080 --> 07:38.680]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[07:38.680 --> 07:39.920]  How much will you need?
[07:39.920 --> 07:40.920]  We don't know.
[07:40.920 --> 07:41.920]  How much do you want?
[07:41.920 --> 07:42.920]  All you can get.
[07:42.920 --> 07:43.920]  I'm Alex Jones.
[07:43.920 --> 07:46.920]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[07:46.920 --> 07:54.440]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[07:54.440 --> 08:00.600]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[08:00.600 --> 08:06.520]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network probably presents the Alex Jones show because there's
[08:06.520 --> 08:14.360]  a war on for your mind.
[08:14.360 --> 08:29.760]  Well, here's the type of news headlines I have in front of me.
[08:29.760 --> 08:39.920]  For more than 12 years, I have seen mainstream news articles, government documents, Texas
[08:39.920 --> 08:47.640]  Department of Transportation, Federal Department of Transportation stating openly that by the
[08:47.640 --> 08:56.560]  year 2011, they planned to have giant pilot programs in every U.S. state with satellite
[08:56.560 --> 09:02.360]  tracker boxes in the car taxing you by the mile on top of your gas tax.
[09:02.360 --> 09:06.040]  And I began about eight, nine years ago seeing articles where they said it would also track
[09:06.040 --> 09:07.280]  your carbon tax.
[09:07.280 --> 09:12.560]  So depending on the type of car you had, you would pay a higher rate, all about setting
[09:12.560 --> 09:17.920]  the precedent that they can control all behavior in engineer society.
[09:17.920 --> 09:22.920]  And I just have the McClatchy newspaper article here as they're preparing the public more
[09:22.920 --> 09:23.920]  for that.
[09:23.920 --> 09:29.640]  And I remember Obama's transportation secretary two months ago said, yes, the feds are looking,
[09:29.640 --> 09:33.840]  we want to put satellite tracker boxes in your cars and tax you by the mile.
[09:33.840 --> 09:36.800]  And then they even proposed it and then Obama came out and said, no, we're not doing that
[09:36.800 --> 09:37.800]  right now.
[09:37.800 --> 09:40.000]  But then they went ahead and started rolling it out.
[09:40.000 --> 09:46.000]  They even have a federal program here in Austin where they pay people to put the satellite
[09:46.000 --> 09:55.960]  tracker box in their car to test the taxation of the slaves Toyota GM and others have announced
[09:55.960 --> 09:56.960]  going back.
[09:56.960 --> 10:01.360]  Oh, I remember seeing it six, seven years ago saying all cars will have cameras in them
[10:01.360 --> 10:09.160]  that watch you and that are dialed in, I remember an MSNBC article to a cell phone just like
[10:09.160 --> 10:17.840]  OnStar that digitizes the video signal and feeds it to local threat fusion FEMA command
[10:17.840 --> 10:19.340]  centers.
[10:19.340 --> 10:24.160]  And it said that it'll be in case somebody is acting up or in a police chase, the police
[10:24.160 --> 10:26.520]  can watch you inside the car.
[10:26.520 --> 10:30.320]  There will be kill switches is already happening with a lot of use cars that are being sold
[10:30.320 --> 10:34.040]  kill switches built in to the ignition.
[10:34.040 --> 10:37.760]  So the police will have a signal they being to turn your car off.
[10:37.760 --> 10:43.320]  They also are selling the program and again, all cars will have this has been announced.
[10:43.320 --> 10:46.320]  What they said by 2011 again on that subject as well.
[10:46.320 --> 10:50.320]  That's kind of the jump date for that.
[10:50.320 --> 10:54.000]  But they're selling it to people, Oh, well, 30 plus children die a year being left in
[10:54.000 --> 10:56.200]  the hot car.
[10:56.200 --> 10:59.360]  And these parents are complete morons, but everybody shouldn't be under big brother surveillance
[10:59.360 --> 11:00.360]  because of it.
[11:00.360 --> 11:05.840]  I didn't know we left my kid in the car and 105 degree heat for an hour they die.
[11:05.840 --> 11:09.720]  Some idiot woman just did that in Austin last week, but thank God her baby didn't die.
[11:09.720 --> 11:14.640]  Left it in 100 plus degree heat meaning was 130 in the car for 45 minutes while she went
[11:14.640 --> 11:16.640]  shopping.
[11:16.640 --> 11:19.040]  Just a complete idiot.
[11:19.040 --> 11:23.600]  But that's what the cultures turn people into side issue.
[11:23.600 --> 11:31.400]  The point is that they say that though the camera will have sensors, movement sensors
[11:31.400 --> 11:33.520]  in the car.
[11:33.520 --> 11:40.560]  And if the if it senses movement after the car goes up above 95 degrees, it will then
[11:40.560 --> 11:44.720]  dial the police and then they'll be able to watch you in the car.
[11:44.720 --> 11:47.800]  I'll never forget the governor of Wisconsin was in the news.
[11:47.800 --> 11:53.480]  It's in my film, Matrix of Evil, Cicera 2004.
[11:53.480 --> 11:58.920]  And in that film, we have the mainstream news article.
[11:58.920 --> 12:00.000]  You want to source it and find it.
[12:00.000 --> 12:06.520]  I forget the exact headline where it was the feds had put in a threat fusion center in
[12:06.520 --> 12:11.920]  Green Bay and talked about how it was also in Milwaukee.
[12:11.920 --> 12:15.240]  And the governor was giving a tour to the news reporters saying, oh, look at this federal
[12:15.240 --> 12:16.240]  center.
[12:16.240 --> 12:19.280]  If we want to know where somebody is, we just punch in their driver's license number.
[12:19.280 --> 12:22.240]  It goes into a federal database of cell phone numbers.
[12:22.240 --> 12:28.400]  That's under the telecommunications act of 96 that became law.
[12:28.400 --> 12:34.680]  This had to be set up by October 1, 2001, but passed in 96, perfect for after the fair
[12:34.680 --> 12:36.120]  mongering of 9 11.
[12:36.120 --> 12:42.760]  But set up actually five years before six years before they had to go into enactment
[12:42.760 --> 12:45.000]  that all cell phones are tracked in real time.
[12:45.000 --> 12:47.640]  The police can dial in and listen to your audio.
[12:47.640 --> 12:49.560]  Even if it's turned off, the feds can.
[12:49.560 --> 12:54.640]  They can also track you down to just a few feet off of GPS triangulation.
[12:54.640 --> 12:59.040]  And even if the phone's not GPS, it's that it's triangulated by GPS markers on the cell
[12:59.040 --> 13:02.400]  towers down to just a few feet.
[13:02.400 --> 13:06.360]  And so there was the governor punching it up and showing everybody citizens in live
[13:06.360 --> 13:12.920]  time driving around in the city of Green Bay and bragging about the federal grant.
[13:12.920 --> 13:17.640]  Now since then, most US cities and threat fusion centers that local police are in being
[13:17.640 --> 13:22.760]  federalized, it's federally paid for federally run, they don't tell local cops until they
[13:22.760 --> 13:24.800]  bring them in and say, oh, there's a new upgrade.
[13:24.800 --> 13:28.080]  We have face scanning cameras in Tampa in Dallas, Texas.
[13:28.080 --> 13:32.000]  We're reading everybody's license plates now that come through the town.
[13:32.000 --> 13:38.440]  They first introduced it to, oh, we're looking for stolen cars.
[13:38.440 --> 13:40.360]  And so that's how it's sold to the public.
[13:40.360 --> 13:43.840]  But I would tell people about this 10 years ago when I was reading DARPA funding for,
[13:43.840 --> 13:48.240]  you know, every car that drives across the state line of Texas or Indiana at the time
[13:48.240 --> 13:53.200]  is to test the states that was actually in 98, my goodness, time is just flying.
[13:53.200 --> 14:02.240]  So 11 years ago and they would read the license plate of every car entering Texas and Indiana.
[14:02.240 --> 14:04.800]  Well, now it's nationwide.
[14:04.800 --> 14:08.960]  That's why there's federal laws and federal grants that the states have to upgrade and
[14:08.960 --> 14:13.920]  have high def cameras now and they've converted almost the entire camera system to the high
[14:13.920 --> 14:18.280]  def, which then feeds into the AI computers.
[14:18.280 --> 14:25.040]  The technology I saw them reporting on five years ago said these cameras can read hundreds
[14:25.040 --> 14:35.320]  of license plates simultaneously per second, per second.
[14:35.320 --> 14:37.920]  And people would laugh and joke and say it didn't exist.
[14:37.920 --> 14:39.640]  You know, local news would make fun of me.
[14:39.640 --> 14:45.240]  Alex says the cameras are reading our license plates.
[14:45.240 --> 14:50.560]  Alex says that they're listening to us with the on-star and our cell phones.
[14:50.560 --> 14:58.760]  It's an absolute on record fact Pentagon design now announced to all the slaves.
[14:58.760 --> 15:03.040]  See once they universally adopted, they go ahead and tell you, oh, guess what?
[15:03.040 --> 15:07.880]  Your driver's license is already federally standardized national ID and it's been so
[15:07.880 --> 15:09.720]  since the early nineties.
[15:09.720 --> 15:11.000]  Oh, guess what?
[15:11.000 --> 15:16.480]  Since 2000, international treaties signed in Australia by the U.S. and 100 plus signatories.
[15:16.480 --> 15:21.400]  It's a world ID standardized system.
[15:21.400 --> 15:32.920]  Oh, I mean, all I'm doing is reporting fact on record and this hurts each and every one
[15:32.920 --> 15:33.920]  of us.
[15:33.920 --> 15:36.560]  Look, I've made a lot of mistakes.
[15:36.560 --> 15:37.880]  God knows I have.
[15:37.880 --> 15:38.880]  I'm not perfect.
[15:38.880 --> 15:39.880]  None of us are.
[15:39.880 --> 15:40.880]  I do the best I can.
[15:40.880 --> 15:41.880]  I swing as hard as I can.
[15:41.880 --> 15:45.240]  I step up to the plate and I go 110%.
[15:45.240 --> 15:50.400]  Sometimes I probably overheat, drive the engine too hard.
[15:50.400 --> 15:54.400]  I've done the equivalent many times on this racetrack of life of blowing engines, spinning
[15:54.400 --> 16:00.640]  out, smashing into the wall, but I get back in the car every single day, ladies and gentlemen.
[16:00.640 --> 16:06.480]  A lot of times it's quantity over quality and I made a lot of mistakes and I think one
[16:06.480 --> 16:09.200]  of the biggest ones and I do it every single week.
[16:09.200 --> 16:10.200]  I make the mistake.
[16:10.200 --> 16:15.720]  I've gotten better is going absolutely ape attacking the police going wild because at
[16:15.720 --> 16:19.280]  a primitive level when I see him throwing people out of wheelchairs and beating them
[16:19.280 --> 16:24.200]  up when I see him choking EMTs for no reason and then defending themselves when I see him
[16:24.200 --> 16:29.160]  taser and old ladies and making excuses about it when I see him shooting a guy in the back
[16:29.160 --> 16:33.240]  when he's in handcuffs and lying about it at a primitive level, I become threatened
[16:33.240 --> 16:39.920]  by that and I know tyranny comes to your door in a uniform historically, but Liberty also
[16:39.920 --> 16:45.120]  comes in a uniform and I know the average police and military are huge fans of the show
[16:45.120 --> 16:49.720]  and I and I'm glad they're sophisticated enough and old enough and had more experience
[16:49.720 --> 17:01.880]  than me in many levels to forgive my stereotypes and how I get out of control.
[17:01.880 --> 17:06.080]  I'm always amazed by the tips and the information police give us that almost always pan out
[17:06.080 --> 17:07.640]  to be real and accurate.
[17:07.640 --> 17:09.800]  In fact, we've never been set up actually.
[17:09.800 --> 17:14.040]  We've never been the info we get from police and highway patrol and military.
[17:14.040 --> 17:17.620]  I don't think it's ever turned out to be baloney because they're good at trying to
[17:17.620 --> 17:18.620]  give you good info.
[17:18.620 --> 17:24.000]  I've never really had a problem and I've been let off of tickets.
[17:24.000 --> 17:29.440]  I do have a heavy foot folks and I've been let off of tickets quite a bit all over the
[17:29.440 --> 17:32.320]  country by police that pull me over and her fans.
[17:32.320 --> 17:36.240]  A few times they've told me I like your show, but I'm still giving you a ticket was driving
[17:36.240 --> 17:37.560]  out there halfway to Crawford.
[17:37.560 --> 17:38.560]  I forget the town.
[17:38.560 --> 17:41.560]  I got a ticket and he said, I listen to show all the time, but you're still getting a ticket
[17:41.560 --> 17:42.560]  for 20 miles over.
[17:42.560 --> 17:44.200]  I was like, real nice.
[17:44.200 --> 17:45.640]  You know, this is a speed trap.
[17:45.640 --> 17:49.960]  There's a school down the road on this country highway and I didn't notice the 40 mile an
[17:49.960 --> 17:51.320]  hour and a 60.
[17:51.320 --> 17:57.040]  But the point is that when I come in here and rant and rave against police, it doesn't
[17:57.040 --> 18:05.240]  help because I only compact some more into their culture and the system puts them in
[18:05.240 --> 18:08.120]  positions, gives them orders that are unconstitutional.
[18:08.120 --> 18:15.120]  The media plays up the bad stuff cops do and it wants the police to feel like everybody
[18:15.120 --> 18:16.120]  hates them.
[18:16.120 --> 18:18.880]  So they'll start hating the public and then the public will hate them more.
[18:18.880 --> 18:25.720]  It's a Psyop and that's one of the biggest mistakes I've fallen into is playing along
[18:25.720 --> 18:26.720]  with that.
[18:26.720 --> 18:27.720]  They make mistakes.
[18:27.720 --> 18:32.640]  Kind of like I would rebel bashing Bill Clinton or rebel bashing Barack Obama instead of
[18:32.640 --> 18:35.200]  just pointing out or George Bush that they're just complete puppets.
[18:35.200 --> 18:39.760]  You know, I revel in calling him the pimp game liar and talk about what a liar he is,
[18:39.760 --> 18:45.320]  but I needed to add in that point I made a few days ago that's gone viral on the web.
[18:45.320 --> 18:51.320]  But yeah, he's lying about signing statements and middle class tax increases and Stephan
[18:51.320 --> 18:56.820]  Offalus on his national TV shows having fun pointing out Barack Obama's a liar when Stephan
[18:56.820 --> 19:01.320]  Offalus is a Clinton operative, a Clinton strategist.
[19:01.320 --> 19:02.320]  Why?
[19:02.320 --> 19:05.520]  Because it's about tearing down Barack Obama.
[19:05.520 --> 19:11.560]  It's about making it him who's the liar so they can get you ready for the next savior.
[19:11.560 --> 19:14.000]  It's about making you think you can't ever have a real leader.
[19:14.000 --> 19:17.320]  It's about making you give up hope.
[19:17.320 --> 19:21.040]  Senator Obama's bad and a liar and a slime ball, but I'm not going to get sucked into
[19:21.040 --> 19:26.040]  the hatred of Barack Obama as if he's actually the guy doing all this.
[19:26.040 --> 19:31.880]  He's just a petty punk talker, slick talker hired by these people.
[19:31.880 --> 19:34.480]  So I want to point that out later.
[19:34.480 --> 19:40.080]  We just got to get more sophisticated and not get played into their games, folks.
[19:40.080 --> 19:44.920]  And again, I want to thank the police again who warned us about operations being run against
[19:44.920 --> 19:49.760]  us and I'll tell you about that coming up the bottom of the hour.
[19:49.760 --> 19:57.160]  I want to thank God for moving them to warn us, cover a lot more news, sterilization of
[19:57.160 --> 20:01.600]  Africans when we get back.
[20:01.600 --> 20:05.320]  Millions of Americans are beginning to realize the enormity of the economic and political
[20:05.320 --> 20:07.640]  problems facing the U.S. and the world.
[20:07.640 --> 20:11.560]  And for the first time in their lives, they are feeling the need for preparedness.
[20:11.560 --> 20:16.040]  Ready Reserve Foods has been in continuous operation, manufacturing the finest and dehydrated
[20:16.040 --> 20:18.040]  foods for almost 40 years.
[20:18.040 --> 20:22.720]  Ready Reserve is the manufacturer, unlike other companies that just broker canned foods.
[20:22.720 --> 20:27.680]  Ready Reserve controls the quality from start to finish with doubly-nameled cans and nitrogen
[20:27.680 --> 20:28.680]  packaging.
[20:28.680 --> 20:32.360]  When purchasing from Ready Reserve Foods, you are buying factory direct at wholesale
[20:32.360 --> 20:33.360]  prices.
[20:33.360 --> 20:36.680]  Other companies are quoting delivery times of one to two months, while Ready Reserve
[20:36.680 --> 20:38.800]  ships within five business days.
[20:38.800 --> 20:42.720]  Many companies do not even offer a catalog, we will be more than happy to send a catalog
[20:42.720 --> 20:53.320]  to you, free of charge, dial 1-800-453-2202, 1-800-453-2202, or visit our website at ReadyReserveFoods.com.

[21:00.800 --> 21:06.920]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[21:06.920 --> 21:11.400]  You've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[21:11.400 --> 21:12.720]  us would like to see.
[21:12.720 --> 21:17.880]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interests
[21:17.880 --> 21:19.080]  of the American people.
[21:19.080 --> 21:23.640]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one of this election.
[21:23.640 --> 21:28.720]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[21:28.720 --> 21:36.800]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist.
[21:36.800 --> 21:40.400]  It's not about left to right, it's about a one-world government.
[21:40.400 --> 21:47.320]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[21:47.320 --> 21:52.920]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high
[21:52.920 --> 21:55.480]  quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[21:55.480 --> 22:00.040]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[22:00.040 --> 22:04.240]  On the average, Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth
[22:04.240 --> 22:06.840]  to retire and live out their golden years.
[22:06.840 --> 22:11.800]  Unfortunately, with taxation, the rising cost of food, energy, housing, and medical, many
[22:11.800 --> 22:14.840]  retirees are forced to live below the poverty line.
[22:14.840 --> 22:18.480]  Is this a flaw for the enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve
[22:18.480 --> 22:23.080]  Note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation, and higher taxes?
[22:23.080 --> 22:26.800]  These questions and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature
[22:26.800 --> 22:28.520]  from Jekyll Island.
[22:28.520 --> 22:32.240]  Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central bank
[22:32.240 --> 22:33.240]  power.
[22:33.240 --> 22:37.240]  A gripping adventure into the secret world of international banking cartel.
[22:37.240 --> 22:38.680]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[22:38.680 --> 22:43.400]  I will give a silver dollar from the early 1900s to anyone who purchases this book.
[22:43.400 --> 22:48.240]  Call 1-800-686-2237 and order a copy today.
[22:48.240 --> 22:51.320]  It's critical that the public be made aware of the system.
[22:51.320 --> 22:56.120]  Call and order your copy today at 1-800-686-2237.
[22:56.120 --> 22:59.440]  That's 1-800-686-2237.
[22:59.440 --> 23:04.520]  Would you give someone $100 for a $10 bill if you're taking vitamins and minerals in
[23:04.520 --> 23:05.520]  a pill form?
[23:05.520 --> 23:07.120]  That's exactly what you're doing.
[23:07.120 --> 23:10.040]  Hello, my name is Dr. David Friedman.
[23:10.040 --> 23:14.040]  According to the physician's desk reference, many vitamins and minerals in a pill form
[23:14.040 --> 23:15.960]  are 10% absorbed.
[23:15.960 --> 23:21.000]  It doesn't take a mathematician to figure out for every $100 you spend on these pills,
[23:21.000 --> 23:23.760]  you're flushing $90 down the toilet.
[23:23.760 --> 23:26.280]  Start absorbing the nutrients you swallow.
[23:26.280 --> 23:31.400]  Then choose for health, a delicious tasting chewable containing 16 super fruits, seed
[23:31.400 --> 23:33.200]  vegetables, and antioxidants.
[23:33.200 --> 23:35.160]  You know, you work hard for your money.
[23:35.160 --> 23:38.040]  Isn't it time to start getting what you pay for?
[23:38.040 --> 23:39.040]  Order today.
[23:39.040 --> 23:42.280]  1-800-210-1922.
[23:42.280 --> 23:45.800]  With Choose for Health, your body gets to keep the nutrients you swallow.
[23:45.800 --> 23:51.240]  The first 300 callers are going to receive a free copy of my best-selling CD, America's
[23:51.240 --> 23:55.720]  Unbalanced Diet, 1-800-210-1922.
[23:55.720 --> 23:57.480]  Or go to orderchoose.com.
[24:55.720 --> 25:04.480]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, bottom line.
[25:04.480 --> 25:09.880]  We are dealing with a complete and total New World Order takeover right now.
[25:09.880 --> 25:12.760]  They are moving on every front.
[25:12.760 --> 25:16.240]  This next three or four months in legislative session, when Obama still got someone of a
[25:16.240 --> 25:22.440]  high approval rating and he controls all three branches of government, we are in serious,
[25:22.440 --> 25:23.440]  serious trouble.
[25:23.440 --> 25:28.920]  And he's got the trifecta, as Bush would call it, the White House, the House, and the Senate.
[25:28.920 --> 25:31.280]  So he has complete control of the legislative.
[25:31.280 --> 25:36.760]  With the capitulation of Norm Coleman to Al Franken yesterday for the Senate, they supposedly
[25:36.760 --> 25:41.320]  got their filibuster proof 60 votes in the Senate.
[25:41.320 --> 25:48.360]  You add to that in case there's ever a tie that the vice president, Mr. Gangster Biden,
[25:48.360 --> 25:52.600]  is a Democrat, and this is what the founding fathers worried about.
[25:52.600 --> 25:57.800]  They said you shouldn't ever have both the House and Senate and the presidency run by
[25:57.800 --> 25:58.800]  one party.
[25:58.800 --> 26:00.360]  They warned the public that that's dangerous.
[26:00.360 --> 26:02.320]  That's why we have separation of powers.
[26:02.320 --> 26:09.720]  So you can't go to Hitler or Napoleon or a Lenin or a Fidel Castro or Hugo Chavez for
[26:09.720 --> 26:10.720]  that matter.
[26:10.720 --> 26:11.960]  Look at Chavez now.
[26:11.960 --> 26:14.880]  We can unlimited stay president and unlimited.
[26:14.880 --> 26:17.600]  He's turning into, it's always the same.
[26:17.600 --> 26:23.280]  War behaves this way, and we're seeing it happen right now.
[26:23.280 --> 26:27.280]  What's some of the other interesting news here, we'll cover this later, Toyota developing
[26:27.280 --> 26:34.520]  mind controlled wheelchair, very interesting article on more serious issues, Rwanda denies
[26:34.520 --> 26:37.120]  sterilization plans, BBC.
[26:37.120 --> 26:42.800]  Funny, last week Rwanda was bragging how they were doing it, and it's hundreds of cases
[26:42.800 --> 26:51.080]  in Latin America, Asia, India, Vietnam, Brazil, Paraguay, I mean all over the U.N. goes in
[26:51.080 --> 26:52.080]  and sterilizes people.
[26:52.080 --> 26:53.080]  It's on record.
[26:53.080 --> 26:54.080]  It's official policy.
[26:54.080 --> 26:57.480]  But see when it gets attention, oh well we're not doing that.
[26:57.480 --> 27:01.640]  Rwanda has strongly denied reports that its parliament is considering a draft law which
[27:01.640 --> 27:05.520]  would forcibly sterilize people who are mentally disabled.
[27:05.520 --> 27:09.680]  The deputy speaker of the parliament was responding to a call by U.S. based activist human rights
[27:09.680 --> 27:11.640]  watch to scrap the proposed law.
[27:11.640 --> 27:16.240]  He told BBC that plans for HIV testing before couples get married are strictly voluntary,
[27:16.240 --> 27:17.240]  not compulsory.
[27:17.240 --> 27:23.240]  Of course there where they get U.N. vaccines, you got 40% of the public who got HIV.
[27:23.240 --> 27:26.800]  And they've gone and done medical tests, and most of them haven't even had sex or ever
[27:26.800 --> 27:33.440]  used a needle other than getting their vaccination.
[27:33.440 --> 27:38.600]  He said he'd never seen a bill of provision which proposed forcible sterilization.
[27:38.600 --> 27:41.760]  And they go on to admit that there had been bills calling for that.
[27:41.760 --> 27:42.760]  There's another one.
[27:42.760 --> 27:44.760]  African women with HIV coerced into sterilization.
[27:44.760 --> 27:49.280]  And they say oh well they've got HIV so we need to sterilize them.
[27:49.280 --> 27:54.400]  Even though a baby only gets HIV about 10% of the time if the mother has it.
[27:54.400 --> 27:59.240]  And HIV is just a cover virus name for a whole bunch of soft kill operations going on.
[27:59.240 --> 28:01.800]  Women in Africa are being sterilized without their consent for being told.
[28:01.800 --> 28:03.680]  The procedure is a routine treatment for AIDS.
[28:03.680 --> 28:04.680]  A lawsuit will claim.
[28:04.680 --> 28:08.800]  Well I mean it's on record that when George Bush headed things up for Nixon, they sterilized
[28:08.800 --> 28:12.120]  40% of Native American women on reservations.
[28:12.120 --> 28:13.120]  That's in Canadian papers.
[28:13.120 --> 28:15.280]  They're doing it up there right now.
[28:15.280 --> 28:19.960]  Okay, here's the really big news.
[28:19.960 --> 28:26.720]  I have a tendency to get on air and not even get to the big news.
[28:26.720 --> 28:28.360]  This is coming up.
[28:28.360 --> 28:33.200]  Federal agents hunt for guns one house at a time.
[28:33.200 --> 28:37.480]  This is out of the Houston Chronicle.
[28:37.480 --> 28:41.280]  It's up on infowars.com and prismplanet.com.
[28:41.280 --> 28:42.680]  We have links to that.
[28:42.680 --> 28:46.320]  They're going house to house looking for your guns.
[28:46.320 --> 28:56.960]  And the disgraced Blagojevich, remember, he announced, well it was six months ago before
[28:56.960 --> 28:58.880]  that old scandal started.
[28:58.880 --> 29:00.600]  We played the press conference here.
[29:00.600 --> 29:03.880]  He said, yeah, we're going to use the National Guard door-to-door going to people's houses
[29:03.880 --> 29:09.920]  searching for guns in Texas and Wisconsin and Nevada and Arizona and California and
[29:09.920 --> 29:11.920]  New York and Massachusetts.
[29:11.920 --> 29:14.200]  In fact, print me a few for folks.
[29:14.200 --> 29:16.320]  I don't want to just say there's articles.
[29:16.320 --> 29:22.240]  Print me knock and talk or police ask residents about guns door-to-door, knock and talk.
[29:22.240 --> 29:25.280]  All over the nation, federal grants, they come and say, mind if we come in and look at your
[29:25.280 --> 29:26.280]  guns, see if they're legal.
[29:26.280 --> 29:28.560]  They do this in Dallas.
[29:28.560 --> 29:29.720]  So they're coming for your guns.
[29:29.720 --> 29:30.800]  It's already begun.
[29:30.800 --> 29:32.320]  They put it on the news to acclimate you.
[29:32.320 --> 29:36.120]  Oh, police are coming door-to-door, asking about your guns.
[29:36.120 --> 29:37.120]  Please answer the questions.
[29:37.120 --> 29:43.360]  It doesn't matter if the guns are legal, we need to go ahead and take those.
[29:43.360 --> 29:50.960]  And a lot more coming up like foreign troops training in the U.S.
[29:50.960 --> 29:52.240]  We're on the march.

[30:18.760 --> 30:20.920]  best superfood of 2009.

[30:34.600 --> 30:39.200]  They're great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system.

[30:41.760 --> 30:42.960]  And take it from me, folks.
[30:42.960 --> 30:44.320]  It really does taste great.

[31:05.480 --> 31:09.840]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[31:09.840 --> 31:12.360]  It's known as the Builder Bird.
[31:12.360 --> 31:16.000]  Both their objective being world domination.
[31:16.000 --> 31:19.160]  For thousands of years their dark order grew.
[31:19.160 --> 31:24.160]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating
[31:24.160 --> 31:29.560]  80% of humanity is at hand.

[31:42.520 --> 31:43.520]  They're not after money.
[31:43.520 --> 31:44.520]  They have all the money they need.

[32:13.600 --> 32:18.280]  Water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride

[34:17.980 --> 34:22.440]  again back Sundays at 4-6pm central standard time with abbreviated transmission.
[34:22.440 --> 34:29.440]  Okay, coming up, I want to go over the latest gun confiscation drills happening in D.C.,
[34:29.440 --> 34:37.080]  in Boston, in Dallas, in Houston, in Phoenix, in Tucson, in Vermont.
[34:37.080 --> 34:38.080]  They're doing it.
[34:38.080 --> 34:41.000]  A lot of conservative pro-gun areas, they're coming to your door and saying, mind if we
[34:41.000 --> 34:42.000]  inspect your guns?
[34:42.000 --> 34:44.720]  And if you say no, they say, what do you have to hide?
[34:44.720 --> 34:48.560]  And again, police, I'm not here trying to attack you, but you're engaged in high treason
[34:48.560 --> 34:52.800]  when you do this, and I know you don't like doing it, because I've seen the polls, when
[34:52.800 --> 34:58.000]  they've done national polls of police, it's 98% on average, you're against gun control.
[34:58.000 --> 34:59.600]  But so what's your problem?
[34:59.600 --> 35:03.320]  Why are you doing something you know is anti-American?
[35:03.320 --> 35:10.080]  Tell the political criminals that run your department, no, your little whorehouse unions
[35:10.080 --> 35:11.560]  are run by the New World Order as well.
[35:11.560 --> 35:13.200]  I'm sick of it!
[35:13.200 --> 35:14.200]  Stop it!
[35:14.200 --> 35:20.480]  This is the United States, it was all paid for in rivers of blood, and you disgrace
[35:20.480 --> 35:24.000]  that, and the cowardly public that doesn't stand up and speak out against this.
[35:24.000 --> 35:28.360]  You're the real people that are responsible for all this happening, okay.
[35:28.360 --> 35:29.360]  I'm going to get to that.
[35:29.360 --> 35:35.080]  Also, key story at infowars.com, FEMA, Israeli Defense Forces, Home Front Command, Partner
[35:35.080 --> 35:41.320]  for Marshall Law, and I wanted to pull up National Exercise 2009 in an L.E. going on
[35:41.320 --> 35:49.120]  right now, going on right now with troops from a whole bunch of foreign nations, openly
[35:49.120 --> 35:52.000]  in where again?
[35:52.000 --> 35:58.080]  In Washington State, in Texas, in Michigan, in New York, and mainly in Arizona.
[35:58.080 --> 36:05.480]  They are doing foreign troop takeover drills in the U.S. for more than 11 years I videotaped
[36:05.480 --> 36:07.600]  these actions and put it out.
[36:07.600 --> 36:13.920]  Now it's mainstream news, more treason.
[36:13.920 --> 36:16.760]  So that is coming up.
[36:16.760 --> 36:25.160]  Remember showing French, German, Dutch, British, Israeli, Australian troops at Urban Warfare
[36:25.160 --> 36:30.800]  99 in Oakland practicing confiscating citizens' guns on video, and I would show you the foreign
[36:30.800 --> 36:35.000]  generals and the troops and people would say, oh, that's not real video, or those aren't
[36:35.000 --> 36:39.680]  real hovercraft, and that's not the real Coronado Marine Amphibious Attack Delivery
[36:39.680 --> 36:40.680]  System.
[36:40.680 --> 36:43.520]  It's like a pocket aircraft carrier.
[36:43.520 --> 36:46.200]  It's about half the size of a regular one.
[36:46.200 --> 36:47.200]  It's gigantic.
[36:47.200 --> 36:49.480]  It's a Marine main delivery ship.
[36:49.480 --> 36:53.560]  The point is, they said that was fake, and the hovercraft was fake, and the warrior fighting
[36:53.560 --> 36:58.640]  vehicles were fake because they couldn't believe the gun confiscation drills were going on.
[36:58.640 --> 37:05.240]  In the video, Colonel Love wasn't real, I interviewed, none of these people were real.
[37:05.240 --> 37:10.040]  No, it was real, the Marine Corps admitted they were doing it, but people had to be in
[37:10.040 --> 37:13.200]  denial watching foreign troops train to take your guns.
[37:13.200 --> 37:17.280]  Well, now here it is, open news.
[37:17.280 --> 37:21.840]  And who's one of the chief advisors, Israeli Defense Forces, Home Front Command, partner
[37:21.840 --> 37:25.080]  for martial law, infowars.com.
[37:25.080 --> 37:34.120]  Who do you think is training most of the local police departments?
[37:34.120 --> 37:38.960]  The IDF, ladies and gentlemen, you can Google that, local police trained by IDF.
[37:38.960 --> 37:40.560]  In fact, print that for me.
[37:40.560 --> 37:43.760]  You guys did a great job printing me all these gun confiscation articles I wanted to put
[37:43.760 --> 37:44.760]  with the Houston stories.
[37:44.760 --> 37:47.560]  People wouldn't think it was an isolated incident.
[37:47.560 --> 37:50.560]  Okay, bottom line, that's all coming up.
[37:50.560 --> 37:58.360]  And Alan want for two hours, um, I said that I wanted to talk about how we basically have
[37:58.360 --> 38:07.480]  bogies on our six on our tail.
[38:07.480 --> 38:13.840]  I have been on the receiving end of a lot of dirty tricks, a lot of COINTELPRO and also
[38:13.840 --> 38:19.960]  just a lot of jealousy across the board.
[38:19.960 --> 38:23.520]  And I've kind of figured out a lot of cowards just are jealous of the fact that they don't
[38:23.520 --> 38:28.800]  have the courage I have and aren't willing to get out there and bust their butts to really
[38:28.800 --> 38:29.920]  make change in the world.
[38:29.920 --> 38:34.480]  So a lot of the attacks against me are just from the mentally ill public.
[38:34.480 --> 38:38.560]  And in a way, those actually advertise who I am and people just come to check out what
[38:38.560 --> 38:41.880]  all the hubbub is about and find out the real me, not the distortion.
[38:41.880 --> 38:43.760]  So in a way, that's a blessing.
[38:43.760 --> 38:49.200]  Every weapon formed against us ends up turning into a blessing.
[38:49.200 --> 38:54.560]  As long as that's in God's plan and I don't ever pretend to pray and tell God what I want
[38:54.560 --> 38:59.040]  or I just know I'm in God's hands and I've tried to be the best person I can.
[38:59.040 --> 39:04.320]  And I know which side I'm on and I know who I belong to and that's just the end of it.
[39:04.320 --> 39:09.680]  A lot of people fighting tyranny in the New World Order get messed with, get picked on,
[39:09.680 --> 39:13.480]  get fiddled with and blow up and go into a million pieces.
[39:13.480 --> 39:14.480]  Not me.
[39:14.480 --> 39:18.200]  It always makes me work harder.
[39:18.200 --> 39:22.720]  And I don't try to get up here and advertise the things we've gone through, the incredible
[39:22.720 --> 39:27.880]  dirty tricks, just things that are really even hard to believe to me and I've experienced
[39:27.880 --> 39:32.480]  it.
[39:32.480 --> 39:35.520]  And there is certainly no doubt in my mind, we wouldn't be on air.
[39:35.520 --> 39:40.320]  I probably wouldn't even be alive or I'd be in prison set up if it wasn't for the fact
[39:40.320 --> 39:46.480]  that God's definitely got some angels protecting me and because of your prayers out there.
[39:46.480 --> 39:51.680]  But I've always warned people when they come to work here, I've always warned the public
[39:51.680 --> 39:55.440]  that when you get involved in this, you need to know this is real.
[39:55.440 --> 39:56.440]  This isn't a game.
[39:56.440 --> 40:01.200]  We're going up against people who don't have any conscience, who are completely ruthless
[40:01.200 --> 40:05.760]  and who actually enjoy hurting innocent people.
[40:05.760 --> 40:07.680]  And you need to be aware of that.
[40:07.680 --> 40:08.680]  They see life as cheap.
[40:08.680 --> 40:13.200]  In fact, they see life, human life as actually dirt, as something bad, as something with
[40:13.200 --> 40:18.160]  negative value, not just cheap.
[40:18.160 --> 40:25.240]  But living, truly living is all about standing up for humanity, going through the fire, making
[40:25.240 --> 40:34.400]  it through on the other side, certainly with some scars and developing as a human being
[40:34.400 --> 40:39.600]  and learning what life is really all about.
[40:39.600 --> 40:50.600]  This duty being honorable, telling the truth, not syncing to other people's level.
[40:50.600 --> 40:54.040]  And so I'm not going to spend much more time talking about all the dirty tricks we go through
[40:54.040 --> 40:57.680]  and the things we face.
[40:57.680 --> 41:05.360]  Other than when we have the FBI show up or we have the Secret Service show up or I get
[41:05.360 --> 41:11.560]  army intelligence guys blocking me in a parking lot and threatening me, or my family gets
[41:11.560 --> 41:16.960]  death threats or a helicopter over my house or a helicopter over my mother's house at
[41:16.960 --> 41:21.840]  50 feet, flipping her off and laughing at her.
[41:21.840 --> 41:26.320]  Or when my children get threatened, I just trust in God and move forward with a lot of
[41:26.320 --> 41:28.800]  other dirty tricks.
[41:28.800 --> 41:34.160]  But I, I'm not going to get specific about the new stuff that's going on other than
[41:34.160 --> 41:44.160]  that it marks a new escalation in dirty tricks against me.
[41:44.160 --> 41:45.440]  And it's only going to give me energy.
[41:45.440 --> 41:49.040]  In fact, I've been really tired lately, working a lot of hours and a lot of interviews trying
[41:49.040 --> 41:56.320]  to finish a book and a film by September, early September.
[41:56.320 --> 41:59.120]  In fact, it's the deadlines actually late August.
[41:59.120 --> 42:06.720]  And actually this persecution always makes me focus, gives me wells of strength, helps
[42:06.720 --> 42:11.240]  me have an attitude adjustment, helps me not be worldly, helps me not be controlled by
[42:11.240 --> 42:21.280]  the flesh and just gives me incredible reserves and founts of, of, of, of will.
[42:21.280 --> 42:25.920]  And it also reaffirms just how important our work is and confirms just how evil this
[42:25.920 --> 42:29.680]  elite is and the system is.
[42:29.680 --> 42:36.120]  But I will say this, a lot of pieces of puzzles come together in research over the years.
[42:36.120 --> 42:39.880]  And you learn from congressional hearings from the church committee on a Cointel pro
[42:39.880 --> 42:44.000]  and black ops against political dissidents in the United States and worldwide and army
[42:44.000 --> 42:52.240]  manuals on the subject, dealing with creating insurgencies or suppressing insurgencies, false
[42:52.240 --> 42:56.520]  flag, black ops, whisper campaigns, things of that nature.
[42:56.520 --> 43:04.000]  A lot of this is on record, the tricks they have in fighting things like that.
[43:04.000 --> 43:13.440]  But I was told by federal and state sources, I have to look out about seven months ago
[43:13.440 --> 43:18.400]  that they were going to try to tie me in with white supremacists who were going to commit
[43:18.400 --> 43:25.960]  violent acts and these came from sources that have never been wrong in the past.
[43:25.960 --> 43:31.720]  And I've gotten other separate sources, which are then telling me the same things.
[43:31.720 --> 43:37.840]  And then you see Poplowski within two hours of him killing those three cops, the Southern
[43:37.840 --> 43:44.280]  Poverty Law Center had contacted their operative, basically a guy who writes about militias
[43:44.280 --> 43:50.760]  and white supremacist and anti-government grips and had fed my name to him saying Poplowski
[43:50.760 --> 43:57.040]  was a fan and simultaneously one of his so-called friends was popping up on TV saying my name
[43:57.040 --> 44:00.560]  when it turned out Poplowski was actually attacking me all over my own site and other
[44:00.560 --> 44:02.280]  sites.
[44:02.280 --> 44:06.280]  And then he'd visited Fox News CNN, it's now coming out in court and hundreds and hundreds
[44:06.280 --> 44:08.680]  of other sites.
[44:08.680 --> 44:15.240]  They chose me to go after within minutes it was being fed to the police, within two hours
[44:15.240 --> 44:16.840]  it was on the news.
[44:16.840 --> 44:20.800]  Who is the first person they think of me?
[44:20.800 --> 44:26.360]  Who is Sauron thinking about me?
[44:26.360 --> 44:29.320]  Where is the I on me?
[44:29.320 --> 44:31.800]  Believe me, I don't like it at a certain level.
[44:31.800 --> 44:36.240]  I know though it's my duty and it means I am hurting them.
[44:36.240 --> 44:39.200]  You are hurting them.
[44:39.200 --> 44:45.280]  And my only fear is if I get set up or I get destroyed, I don't want you to take that
[44:45.280 --> 44:46.280]  as a defeat.
[44:46.280 --> 44:49.680]  I want you to take that as a victory and realize how bad we're hurting them and don't let that
[44:49.680 --> 44:50.680]  cal you.
[44:50.680 --> 44:55.880]  I want you to intensify everything you're doing, not redoubling, not 10%, not 100%,
[44:55.880 --> 45:00.760]  a thousand percent because they can't get all of us, they can't demonize all of us,
[45:00.760 --> 45:04.360]  they can't kill all of us, they can't shut us all down.
[45:04.360 --> 45:06.520]  If they shut me up, who will take my place?
[45:06.520 --> 45:07.520]  All of you.
[45:07.520 --> 45:11.360]  So don't get involved in the COINTELPRO, don't get involved in the petty flesh things they
[45:11.360 --> 45:14.560]  do getting us all debating like we're all in a race car race with each other.
[45:14.560 --> 45:21.440]  We're in a race against the new order together.
[45:21.440 --> 45:25.280]  And so all over the country with Von Brun, that's clearly a setup.
[45:25.280 --> 45:29.400]  He's been in federal custody for six years and to now even come out in the National
[45:29.400 --> 45:33.920]  Press Club and in mainstream articles that Von Brun was tied into special forces and
[45:33.920 --> 45:42.160]  some weird white supremacist network in the military and police.
[45:42.160 --> 45:45.080]  Southern Poverty Law Center ADL have been caught running white supremacist compounds
[45:45.080 --> 45:48.400]  over and over again, especially the Southern Poverty Law Center, Elohim City, Oklahoma
[45:48.400 --> 45:49.400]  City.
[45:49.400 --> 45:54.560]  It's come out in lawsuits, here's the FBI they've been forced and ordered in Salt Lake
[45:54.560 --> 45:58.600]  City to release documents proving that.
[45:58.600 --> 46:04.400]  Mary Nichols assigned affidavits that McVeigh was a government black high-level above top
[46:04.400 --> 46:06.600]  secret infiltrator and provocateur.
[46:06.600 --> 46:11.800]  Look how they burned him, just like they burned the torturers at some of the torture camps
[46:11.800 --> 46:14.560]  and used Patriot Act to shut them up and send them to prison.
[46:14.560 --> 46:18.880]  Even though the memos say they were ordered by Bush and Gonzalez to do it, when they started
[46:18.880 --> 46:22.240]  burning you as a patsy, you said, hey, I was ordered to and released the document and they
[46:22.240 --> 46:28.680]  sent your butt to prison for life using Patriot Act, didn't they?
[46:28.680 --> 46:32.400]  You better think about that, all of you, when they're trying to recruit all these CIA radio
[46:32.400 --> 46:37.200]  and TV ads, recruiting all these stupid college students as they triple their amount of domestic
[46:37.200 --> 46:38.200]  humet.
[46:38.200 --> 46:44.200]  I mean, they're spooking the entire country, they are turning us, mainstream news is reported,
[46:44.200 --> 46:49.280]  we have a higher ratio now of spooks than East Germany had at its height under Marcus
[46:49.280 --> 46:55.680]  Wolff, who they by the way hired as a consultant in 2002-2003, that's in the federal purchase
[46:55.680 --> 46:56.680]  orders.
[46:56.680 --> 46:59.880]  I didn't believe that when I saw it in the news, I went and looked up the congressional
[46:59.880 --> 47:01.880]  funding for it.
[47:01.880 --> 47:07.640]  Marcus Wolff set up what we're dealing with here.
[47:07.640 --> 47:16.240]  This isn't a game and so, yes, the first name on their lips is me, Alex Jones and that really
[47:16.240 --> 47:21.800]  made me have a gut check and there's been a bunch of other stuff going on.
[47:21.800 --> 47:27.080]  Now we know what they're doing, as they're going out and contacting Patriot groups, 911
[47:27.080 --> 47:34.400]  truth groups, student groups with these quasi-militia truth groups, just like they did in the 90s,
[47:34.400 --> 47:37.600]  trying to demonize the Patriot movement, they infiltrated militias, tried to radicalize
[47:37.600 --> 47:40.880]  them and they buried pipe bombs on their property, BATF was caught doing this, then
[47:40.880 --> 47:43.520]  taken to prison.
[47:43.520 --> 47:48.680]  What they're trying to do is have Patriot groups go out and then poses me, use my name,
[47:48.680 --> 47:51.080]  do things like that.
[47:51.080 --> 47:55.240]  What they do is they bust somebody and then say, if you go out and affiliate yourself
[47:55.240 --> 47:58.920]  with Alex Jones and then say racist things and do this, this and that and do other even
[47:58.920 --> 48:04.600]  more horrid things, then later we're going to stage a bust to anybody you get into your
[48:04.600 --> 48:07.600]  group and then we're going to try to tie that in with Alex Jones.
[48:07.600 --> 48:12.600]  And I've been told this now by two sources I know and then other sources have been sending
[48:12.600 --> 48:16.600]  us documentation and even links to government files.
[48:16.600 --> 48:19.880]  A lot of this comes out of the South where the Southern Paralympic Law Center is really
[48:19.880 --> 48:27.320]  in, they've got a lot of power, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia, South Carolina
[48:27.320 --> 48:35.760]  and I've been sent, even back in the late 90s, I've been sent later declassified documents
[48:35.760 --> 48:42.000]  and documents released in court where my emails are being read and so what we've done is we
[48:42.000 --> 48:46.840]  just put out the news, make the films, kind of isolate ourselves from everybody else.
[48:46.840 --> 48:51.320]  Because I mean, I can be in an event, signing videos and I'll have three undercover cops
[48:51.320 --> 48:55.600]  walk over and say, Alex, let's go kill cops, let's blow something up and I just say, come
[48:55.600 --> 48:56.600]  on man.
[48:56.600 --> 49:00.600]  And he sometimes will even go, I'm just checking, come on, just do my job because I'll follow
[49:00.600 --> 49:02.680]  the person out in the parking lot and go, what are you doing?
[49:02.680 --> 49:03.680]  You know I'm nonviolent.
[49:03.680 --> 49:08.600]  I've had them come up and say, let's attack the State Department when I'm at Bilderberg.
[49:08.600 --> 49:10.680]  Just openly and you go, come on, man.
[49:10.680 --> 49:11.680]  Just do my job.
[49:11.680 --> 49:13.960]  They even come right out and admit their cops.
[49:13.960 --> 49:16.080]  I'm sick of it.
[49:16.080 --> 49:23.520]  You are criminals when you try to do this to me, when you try to set me up and know this.
[49:23.520 --> 49:27.640]  We have systems where no matter what happens to me, you legally are going to be brought
[49:27.640 --> 49:33.160]  to justice and your name is going to be brought out and all of you, you know, just run your
[49:33.160 --> 49:38.840]  black ops against me but in the end, you're only going to make me stronger.
[49:38.840 --> 49:41.800]  And that's why I want to read the 23rd Psalm out there and ask everybody to pray for us
[49:41.800 --> 49:42.800]  in this ministry.
[49:42.800 --> 49:45.520]  The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not be in want.
[49:45.520 --> 49:47.760]  He maketh me lie down in green pastures.
[49:47.760 --> 49:50.000]  He leads me beside quiet waters.
[49:50.000 --> 49:51.480]  He restores my soul.
[49:51.480 --> 49:54.760]  He guides me in pass of righteousness for his name's sake.
[49:54.760 --> 49:59.680]  Even though I walk to the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for you are
[49:59.680 --> 50:00.680]  with me.
[50:00.680 --> 50:03.040]  Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[50:03.040 --> 50:10.400]  You prepare a table before me and the presence of my enemies.
[50:10.400 --> 50:12.680]  You anoint my head with oil.
[50:12.680 --> 50:18.680]  My cup overfloweth, surely goodness and love will follow me all the days of my life and
[50:18.680 --> 50:22.400]  I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever.
[50:22.400 --> 50:25.240]  And that's the most important part there in the end.
[50:25.240 --> 50:31.040]  They can kill my body, they can kill my name but God knows the truth about what's written
[50:31.040 --> 50:33.000]  on my heart.
[50:33.000 --> 50:37.320]  And I discovered the horrible things they're planning to try to put on me but I happily
[50:37.320 --> 50:44.800]  take this burden and I cheerfully move forward and I want you all to have that spirit of
[50:44.800 --> 50:50.360]  liberty in your hearts and know that we will go through this dark storm but as long as
[50:50.360 --> 50:54.840]  we put on the armor of righteousness, we will defeat the enemy and remember the enemy will
[50:54.840 --> 50:59.480]  always tell you you're not good and you're not righteous, he will attack your faith.
[50:59.480 --> 51:11.120]  You know that the economy is getting worse, but there is hope.
[51:11.120 --> 51:15.800]  Robert Beatles' new book, Here's What You Do, tells you what to do and how to do it.
[51:15.800 --> 51:20.240]  Even a 10 year old can figure it out after reading this 72 page book and the best part,
[51:20.240 --> 51:22.360]  this book is priced under $10.
[51:22.360 --> 51:26.960]  Don't be the victim, be a victor, go to here's what you do dot net, that's here's what you
[51:26.960 --> 51:27.960]  do dot net.
[51:27.960 --> 51:57.920]  Again, here's what you do dot net.
[51:57.920 --> 52:02.120]  Hey folks, Alex Jones here.

[52:05.880 --> 52:07.480]  and struggling to make payments.

[54:20.100 --> 54:26.600]  The sun is hot in the Texas sky.
[54:26.600 --> 54:32.580]  Garden growing, clothes out on a line.
[54:32.580 --> 54:38.640]  Dusty roads when a car goes by.
[54:38.640 --> 54:42.640]  The story fell out a days long ago
[54:44.640 --> 54:47.640]  And the only place she'd ever been
[54:50.640 --> 54:52.640]  Singin' softly
[54:52.640 --> 54:55.640]  This world was not my home
[54:56.640 --> 54:59.640]  And memories take me back again
[55:01.640 --> 55:03.640]  When I was young
[55:03.640 --> 55:05.640]  And grandma wasn't old
[55:05.640 --> 55:07.640]  There are no atheists in foxholes
[55:07.640 --> 55:09.640]  And she guided me
[55:09.640 --> 55:11.640]  And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever
[55:12.640 --> 55:13.640]  That's what matters
[55:13.640 --> 55:16.640]  Anything we didn't have
[55:16.640 --> 55:19.640]  We didn't really need to hope
[55:19.640 --> 55:21.640]  When I was young
[55:21.640 --> 55:23.640]  Alright, we're gonna know what on a date after
[55:23.640 --> 55:28.640]  I got a bunch of news to cover here
[55:29.640 --> 55:31.640]  Massive gun grabbing going on
[55:31.640 --> 55:33.640]  We'll cover some of that with Ellen Watt
[55:33.640 --> 55:35.640]  But I wanted to get into this now
[55:35.640 --> 55:37.640]  I'm afraid it needs to go mega viral
[55:37.640 --> 55:40.640]  I want to thank all of you that get the word out
[55:40.640 --> 55:43.640]  You're really the reason we've had so much success
[55:43.640 --> 55:45.640]  At reaching the people
[55:45.640 --> 55:48.640]  And why the establishment is really going into high gear against me
[55:48.640 --> 55:51.640]  Hit pieces just coming out everywhere on the mainstream news
[55:52.640 --> 55:55.640]  FEMA, Israeli Defense Forces
[55:56.640 --> 55:59.640]  Homefront Partner for Martial Law
[55:59.640 --> 56:03.640]  A press release
[56:03.640 --> 56:05.640]  Buried on the FEMA website
[56:05.640 --> 56:07.640]  Dated June 3rd 2009
[56:07.640 --> 56:09.640]  Announces a meeting between
[56:09.640 --> 56:12.640]  FEMA Administrator Craig Fugate
[56:12.640 --> 56:15.640]  And Major General Yari Golan
[56:15.640 --> 56:17.640]  Of the Israeli Defense Forces Homefront Command
[56:18.640 --> 56:20.640]  And now I have our own Homefront Command
[56:20.640 --> 56:22.640]  I look forward to working with my Israeli counterpart
[56:22.640 --> 56:25.640]  As co-chair of an emergency management working group
[56:25.640 --> 56:27.640]  To improve emergency management practices
[56:27.640 --> 56:29.640]  In both countries
[56:29.640 --> 56:32.640]  I mean, folks, regardless of what you think of Israel
[56:32.640 --> 56:35.640]  Either way, we shouldn't have a guy who's IDF
[56:35.640 --> 56:37.640]  And openly has dual loyalty
[56:37.640 --> 56:39.640]  Of even that as chief of staff
[56:39.640 --> 56:42.640]  Who also says he wants to disarm all Americans
[56:42.640 --> 56:44.640]  I mean, imagine if there was an American
[56:44.640 --> 56:47.640]  Who was the deputy or the chief of staff
[56:47.640 --> 56:49.640]  Of the prime minister of Israel
[56:49.640 --> 56:51.640]  Saying disarm the Israeli people
[56:51.640 --> 56:53.640]  I mean, it's just outrageous
[56:53.640 --> 56:57.640]  I look forward to working with my Israeli counterpart
[56:57.640 --> 57:00.640]  As co-chair of the emergency management work group
[57:00.640 --> 57:02.640]  To improve emergency management practices
[57:02.640 --> 57:04.640]  In both countries, said Fugate
[57:04.640 --> 57:06.640]  These partnerships are critical in ensuring
[57:06.640 --> 57:09.640]  We are incorporating the best practices
[57:09.640 --> 57:12.640]  And most workable towards greater public preparedness
[57:12.640 --> 57:14.640]  The Israeli National Emergency Management Authority
[57:14.640 --> 57:18.640]  And FEMA partnership will establish under
[57:18.640 --> 57:22.640]  An emergency management work stream work group establishment
[57:22.640 --> 57:24.640]  Under 2007 memorandum of understanding
[57:24.640 --> 57:27.640]  With DHS, according to press release FEMA
[57:27.640 --> 57:30.640]  Representatives attended the National Preparedness Exercise
[57:30.640 --> 57:34.640]  Turning point three in Israel on June 1st, 2009
[57:34.640 --> 57:37.640]  And Israel sent observers to the top off
[57:37.640 --> 57:40.640]  For national level exercise in the United States
[57:40.640 --> 57:42.640]  As well as personnel that participate in FEMA's
[57:42.640 --> 57:44.640]  Emergency management training
[57:46.640 --> 57:50.640]  Top off or top officials is billed as a national
[57:50.640 --> 57:52.640]  Premier terrorism preparedness exercise
[57:52.640 --> 57:54.640]  Yeah, and in these top off exercises
[57:54.640 --> 57:57.640]  They drill putting Americans in mass camps
[57:57.640 --> 57:59.640]  That's Ben and even the Denver Post
[57:59.640 --> 58:01.640]  So there's your FEMA camps right there
[58:01.640 --> 58:03.640]  By Department of Homeland Security
[58:03.640 --> 58:06.640]  Thousands of federal, state, territorial
[58:06.640 --> 58:08.640]  And local officials engage in various activities
[58:08.640 --> 58:11.640]  As part of the robust, full scale simulated response
[58:11.640 --> 58:13.640]  The multi-faceted threat
[58:13.640 --> 58:15.640]  If you try to go videotape these reports
[58:15.640 --> 58:17.640]  They arrest you by the way
[58:17.640 --> 58:19.640]  They practice blowing up buses, buildings
[58:19.640 --> 58:21.640]  They'll announce terrorists have really hit
[58:21.640 --> 58:23.640]  Locally on the news and day later say it was just a drill
[58:23.640 --> 58:26.640]  So I've got that, it ties into national level
[58:26.640 --> 58:29.640]  Exercise 2009, saying it's working with
[58:29.640 --> 58:32.640]  Dozens of governments to coordinate a terror attack
[58:32.640 --> 58:35.640]  In the U.S. and how those foreign governments
[58:35.640 --> 58:37.640]  Will quote help the United States
[58:37.640 --> 58:39.640]  Stay with us

[58:49.640 --> 58:52.640]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[58:52.640 --> 58:55.640]  You should consider buying a solar power generator this summer
[58:55.640 --> 58:57.640]  Number one, new climate legislation
[58:57.640 --> 58:59.640]  Could easily double or triple your electric bill
[58:59.640 --> 59:01.640]  Number two, our new energies are
[59:01.640 --> 59:03.640]  Wants to control how much power
[59:03.640 --> 59:05.640]  Your electric company allows you to have
[59:05.640 --> 59:07.640]  It's true, total government control
[59:07.640 --> 59:09.640]  Of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[59:09.640 --> 59:10.640]  Is coming
[59:10.640 --> 59:12.640]  Number three, in some areas of the country
[59:12.640 --> 59:14.640]  The power grid is dangerously overloaded
[59:14.640 --> 59:16.640]  Especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[59:16.640 --> 59:18.640]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous
[59:18.640 --> 59:20.640]  Summer storm season is here again
[59:20.640 --> 59:22.640]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power
[59:22.640 --> 59:24.640]  From weather related outages
[59:24.640 --> 59:26.640]  Number five, a solar power generator
[59:26.640 --> 59:28.640]  Provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[59:28.640 --> 59:30.640]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power
[59:30.640 --> 59:32.640]  Generators offered by Solutions from Science
[59:32.640 --> 59:34.640]  A long time sponsor of ours
[59:34.640 --> 59:36.640]  You can get more information at
[59:36.640 --> 59:38.640]  www.mysolarbackup.com

[59:54.640 --> 59:58.640]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[1:00:04.640 --> 1:00:05.640]  Big brother
[1:00:05.640 --> 1:00:07.640]  Mainstream media
[1:00:07.640 --> 1:00:09.640]  Government cover-ups
[1:00:09.640 --> 1:00:11.640]  You want answers?
[1:00:11.640 --> 1:00:12.640]  Well, so does he
[1:00:12.640 --> 1:00:14.640]  He's Alex Jones
[1:00:14.640 --> 1:00:16.640]  On the GCN Radio Network
[1:00:16.640 --> 1:00:19.640]  And now, live from Austin, Texas
[1:00:19.640 --> 1:00:21.640]  Alex Jones
[1:00:31.640 --> 1:00:34.640]  By the way, we got John Reese Davies
[1:00:36.640 --> 1:00:37.640]  Coming on next Tuesday
[1:00:37.640 --> 1:00:40.640]  I just want to tell you, my producer just confirmed that
[1:00:40.640 --> 1:00:42.640]  He plays Gimli the Dwarf in Lord of the Rings
[1:00:42.640 --> 1:00:45.640]  He's, you know, in Raiders of the Lost Ark
[1:00:45.640 --> 1:00:47.640]  Literally hundreds of big films
[1:00:47.640 --> 1:00:49.640]  He is a patriot we've learned
[1:00:49.640 --> 1:00:51.640]  Anti-New World Order
[1:00:52.640 --> 1:00:54.640]  I really should announce big guests like that
[1:00:54.640 --> 1:00:56.640]  Till they're actually on, but
[1:00:56.640 --> 1:00:58.640]  There you have it, that's set up
[1:00:58.640 --> 1:01:00.640]  He'll be on next week
[1:01:01.640 --> 1:01:03.640]  Look forward to that
[1:01:03.640 --> 1:01:06.640]  Very interesting
[1:01:08.640 --> 1:01:11.640]  I was just going over the fact that
[1:01:12.640 --> 1:01:16.640]  NATO countries, Israel, England, others
[1:01:16.640 --> 1:01:19.640]  Are training
[1:01:19.640 --> 1:01:20.640]  For the next month
[1:01:20.640 --> 1:01:23.640]  It's been going on already for a week and a half
[1:01:26.640 --> 1:01:29.640]  With local police
[1:01:29.640 --> 1:01:32.640]  For massive coordinated terror attacks
[1:01:32.640 --> 1:01:34.640]  In the United States, which will be
[1:01:34.640 --> 1:01:36.640]  Of course, carried out by the New World Order
[1:01:36.640 --> 1:01:37.640]  They've been caught over and over again
[1:01:37.640 --> 1:01:39.640]  It's official government policy to stage terror
[1:01:39.640 --> 1:01:41.640]  It's taught to army captains and above
[1:01:41.640 --> 1:01:43.640]  In Black Ops, official 2004 training manual
[1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:45.640]  I mean, how do these guys have training manuals
[1:01:45.640 --> 1:01:47.640]  Teaching them how to stage terror attacks
[1:01:47.640 --> 1:01:50.640]  But then they believe 9-11 wasn't staged
[1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:52.640]  Hey, print me that article
[1:01:52.640 --> 1:01:54.640]  You don't dare scare a police officer
[1:01:54.640 --> 1:01:56.640]  I forgot to print that one up on info wars.com
[1:01:56.640 --> 1:01:58.640]  So, national level exercise 2009
[1:01:58.640 --> 1:02:00.640]  We've been talking about this for a month
[1:02:00.640 --> 1:02:02.640]  But here it is, national level exercise
[1:02:02.640 --> 1:02:07.640]  Is scheduled for July 27th to July 31st
[1:02:07.640 --> 1:02:09.640]  Now, that's only one of the national level exercise
[1:02:09.640 --> 1:02:11.640]  They have another one that's kind of preparation
[1:02:11.640 --> 1:02:14.640]  For this that's been going on in the build up
[1:02:14.640 --> 1:02:16.640]  Since the middle of June through July
[1:02:16.640 --> 1:02:18.640]  There's a bunch of these
[1:02:18.640 --> 1:02:20.640]  NLE09 will be the first major exercise
[1:02:20.640 --> 1:02:21.640]  Conducted by the United States government
[1:02:21.640 --> 1:02:23.640]  That will focus extensively on terrorism
[1:02:23.640 --> 1:02:25.640]  Prevention, protection, as opposed to
[1:02:25.640 --> 1:02:27.640]  Incident response and recovery
[1:02:27.640 --> 1:02:29.640]  It's a giant intelligence op
[1:02:29.640 --> 1:02:33.640]  NLE09 is designated as a tier one level exercise
[1:02:33.640 --> 1:02:35.640]  National level exercise
[1:02:35.640 --> 1:02:37.640]  Tier one exclusively exercises
[1:02:37.640 --> 1:02:40.640]  Formally known as the top officials exercise series
[1:02:40.640 --> 1:02:42.640]  Or top off are conducted annually
[1:02:42.640 --> 1:02:46.640]  In accordance with the national exercise program NEP
[1:02:46.640 --> 1:02:50.640]  Which serves as the nation's over reaching
[1:02:50.640 --> 1:02:53.640]  Exercise program for planning, organizing
[1:02:53.640 --> 1:02:56.640]  Conducting and evaluating national level exercises
[1:02:56.640 --> 1:02:58.640]  A year before 9-11 they did drills
[1:02:58.640 --> 1:03:00.640]  With flying hijacked jets in the World Trade Center
[1:03:00.640 --> 1:03:02.640]  In Pentagon under one, I would add
[1:03:02.640 --> 1:03:04.640]  They've got others that Denver Post reported on
[1:03:04.640 --> 1:03:06.640]  They did one in Denver back in 2000
[1:03:06.640 --> 1:03:08.640]  Practicing rounding up the citizens
[1:03:08.640 --> 1:03:10.640]  Putting them in the sports stadium
[1:03:10.640 --> 1:03:12.640]  You can go pull that up if you want
[1:03:12.640 --> 1:03:14.640]  The NEP was established, provided to U.S. government
[1:03:14.640 --> 1:03:16.640]  At all levels, exercise opportunities
[1:03:16.640 --> 1:03:18.640]  To prepare for catastrophic crises ranging from
[1:03:18.640 --> 1:03:20.640]  Terrorism and natural disasters
[1:03:20.640 --> 1:03:22.640]  What it is is a federalization test
[1:03:22.640 --> 1:03:24.640]  For testing control over local counties, cities
[1:03:24.640 --> 1:03:26.640]  And states for martial law as put on paper
[1:03:26.640 --> 1:03:28.640]  For authorization acts, stating
[1:03:28.640 --> 1:03:31.640]  And now the DHS reports say it's for veterans, gun owners
[1:03:31.640 --> 1:03:34.640]  And the states saying no to federalization
[1:03:34.640 --> 1:03:36.640]  And using quote the army, homeland security
[1:03:36.640 --> 1:03:38.640]  Brigades against the American people
[1:03:38.640 --> 1:03:41.640]  And quote pulling triggers on American citizens
[1:03:41.640 --> 1:03:44.640]  NLE09 is a White House directed
[1:03:44.640 --> 1:03:45.640]  That's under National Security Council
[1:03:45.640 --> 1:03:47.640]  And General James Jones
[1:03:47.640 --> 1:03:49.640]  Congressionally mandated exercise
[1:03:49.640 --> 1:03:51.640]  That includes the participation of all appropriate
[1:03:51.640 --> 1:03:54.640]  Federal Department and senior agency officials
[1:03:54.640 --> 1:03:56.640]  To decide from FEMA
[1:03:56.640 --> 1:03:58.640]  Homeland security committee in the House
[1:03:58.640 --> 1:04:00.640]  Is not allowed to see this under PDD 51
[1:04:00.640 --> 1:04:02.640]  So another lie
[1:04:02.640 --> 1:04:04.640]  It's not congressional mandated at that level
[1:04:04.640 --> 1:04:06.640]  Their deputies, staff and key operations
[1:04:06.640 --> 1:04:08.640]  Elements in addition, broad regional participation
[1:04:08.640 --> 1:04:10.640]  Of state, tribal, local, private sector
[1:04:10.640 --> 1:04:12.640]  Is anticipated
[1:04:12.640 --> 1:04:14.640]  And we'll know they tell them we have the FEMA documents
[1:04:14.640 --> 1:04:16.640]  It's law, they've got to follow their orders
[1:04:16.640 --> 1:04:18.640]  This year the United States welcomes the participation
[1:04:18.640 --> 1:04:20.640]  Of Australia, Canada, Mexico, the United Kingdom
[1:04:20.640 --> 1:04:22.640]  In NLE09
[1:04:22.640 --> 1:04:24.640]  The leaders participating
[1:04:24.640 --> 1:04:26.640]  I always just throw out a dozen
[1:04:26.640 --> 1:04:28.640]  It's 15 that I saw
[1:04:28.640 --> 1:04:30.640]  And now they're announcing others are helping
[1:04:30.640 --> 1:04:32.640]  Run intelligence on American citizens
[1:04:32.640 --> 1:04:34.640]  Exercise focus
[1:04:34.640 --> 1:04:36.640]  We'll get more to this with Alan Watt
[1:04:36.640 --> 1:04:38.640]  And a lot more coming up
[1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:40.640]  And massive gun confiscation drills
[1:04:40.640 --> 1:04:42.640]  That are gone live
[1:04:42.640 --> 1:04:44.640]  They're actually coming to people's doors
[1:04:44.640 --> 1:04:46.640]  And demanding to search them
[1:04:46.640 --> 1:04:48.640]  Right now
[1:04:48.640 --> 1:04:50.640]  All over the United States
[1:04:50.640 --> 1:04:52.640]  They're going live
[1:04:52.640 --> 1:04:54.640]  And they've got foreign troops and intelligence officers
[1:04:54.640 --> 1:04:56.640]  Helping in the mobile command centers
[1:04:56.640 --> 1:05:22.640]  Run these black ops against the US slaves
[1:05:22.640 --> 1:05:28.640]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed
[1:05:28.640 --> 1:05:30.640]  And trained to levels that exceed law enforcement
[1:05:30.640 --> 1:05:32.640]  And military standards
[1:05:32.640 --> 1:05:34.640]  Front site provides such training without any boot camp mentality
[1:05:34.640 --> 1:05:36.640]  Or drill instructor attitudes
[1:05:36.640 --> 1:05:38.640]  This is real

[1:05:58.640 --> 1:06:00.640]  Hello friends this is Alex Jones
[1:06:00.640 --> 1:06:02.640]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self sufficient
[1:06:02.640 --> 1:06:04.640]  And today that's more important than ever
[1:06:04.640 --> 1:06:06.640]  We need to be independent
[1:06:06.640 --> 1:06:08.640]  And food and water is the key
[1:06:08.640 --> 1:06:10.640]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line
[1:06:10.640 --> 1:06:12.640]  For you have your own bread
[1:06:12.640 --> 1:06:14.640]  You'll never have to go to the super dove
[1:06:14.640 --> 1:06:16.640]  And beg for FEMA to take care of your family
[1:06:16.640 --> 1:06:18.640]  In any emergency if you simply prepare
[1:06:18.640 --> 1:06:20.640]  No one is going to take care of your family
[1:06:20.640 --> 1:06:22.640]  In the final equation but you

[1:07:50.640 --> 1:07:54.640]  The number to call is 1-800-506-5904
[1:07:54.640 --> 1:07:58.640]  That's 1-800-506-5904
[1:07:58.640 --> 1:08:18.640]  Call today
[1:08:28.640 --> 1:08:30.640]  And for the next two hours
[1:08:30.640 --> 1:08:32.640]  We are joined by
[1:08:32.640 --> 1:08:34.640]  Researcher Alan Watt
[1:08:34.640 --> 1:08:36.640]  Who really is an expert on the eugenics
[1:08:36.640 --> 1:08:38.640]  The architecture of the global slave state
[1:08:38.640 --> 1:08:40.640]  The system that we're under
[1:08:40.640 --> 1:08:42.640]  And today I want to get more
[1:08:42.640 --> 1:08:44.640]  Into the architecture of the New World Order
[1:08:44.640 --> 1:08:46.640]  With Alan Watt
[1:08:46.640 --> 1:08:48.640]  And how their control grid
[1:08:48.640 --> 1:08:50.640]  Works the different
[1:08:50.640 --> 1:08:52.640]  Hegelian dialectic factions
[1:08:52.640 --> 1:08:54.640]  They use to create
[1:08:54.640 --> 1:08:56.640]  The synthesis of control
[1:08:56.640 --> 1:08:58.640]  They say there's no way the slaves
[1:08:58.640 --> 1:09:00.640]  Will even read this in care
[1:09:00.640 --> 1:09:02.640]  Too few of them will
[1:09:02.640 --> 1:09:04.640]  They claim they're all high and mighty
[1:09:04.640 --> 1:09:06.640]  And doing this for great scientific reasons
[1:09:06.640 --> 1:09:08.640]  To call the population to save the earth
[1:09:08.640 --> 1:09:10.640]  But they're actually very sadistic
[1:09:10.640 --> 1:09:12.640]  And enjoy what they're doing
[1:09:12.640 --> 1:09:14.640]  From their own actions and statements
[1:09:14.640 --> 1:09:16.640]  And the very dark poetry they write
[1:09:16.640 --> 1:09:18.640]  About destroying the universe
[1:09:18.640 --> 1:09:20.640]  Just for the willingness of it
[1:09:20.640 --> 1:09:22.640]  Just for the nihilistic enjoyment
[1:09:22.640 --> 1:09:24.640]  And the different strata
[1:09:24.640 --> 1:09:26.640]  Of the high system
[1:09:26.640 --> 1:09:28.640]  That they're striving for
[1:09:28.640 --> 1:09:30.640]  And certainly they're very specialized
[1:09:30.640 --> 1:09:32.640]  The elites
[1:09:32.640 --> 1:09:34.640]  And the inbreeding creates a lot of mental illness
[1:09:34.640 --> 1:09:36.640]  A lot of megalomania
[1:09:36.640 --> 1:09:38.640]  I want to go over that with Alan Watt
[1:09:38.640 --> 1:09:40.640]  And then later in the sour into the next
[1:09:40.640 --> 1:09:42.640]  Taking your phone calls get into the current operation
[1:09:42.640 --> 1:09:44.640]  Because they're at a major jump point
[1:09:44.640 --> 1:09:46.640]  They're launching the total global
[1:09:46.640 --> 1:09:48.640]  Banking takeover publicly
[1:09:48.640 --> 1:09:50.640]  They're launching the hate crimes
[1:09:50.640 --> 1:09:52.640]  Banning free speech as past the house
[1:09:52.640 --> 1:09:54.640]  All water, simultaneously in England
[1:09:54.640 --> 1:09:56.640]  Australia, Canada
[1:09:56.640 --> 1:09:58.640]  United States, Europe, Africa
[1:09:58.640 --> 1:10:00.640]  Sterilizations openly being announced
[1:10:00.640 --> 1:10:02.640]  They're moving forward
[1:10:02.640 --> 1:10:04.640]  With massive gun restrictions in the US
[1:10:04.640 --> 1:10:06.640]  The same thing they've done in Europe
[1:10:06.640 --> 1:10:08.640]  And in England and in Canada
[1:10:08.640 --> 1:10:10.640]  It's all happening
[1:10:10.640 --> 1:10:12.640]  They are moving with a total blanket
[1:10:12.640 --> 1:10:14.640]  Amnesty, breaking down the borders
[1:10:14.640 --> 1:10:16.640]  Openly saying they want to break down
[1:10:16.640 --> 1:10:18.640]  And blow out the economy so we're all bankrupt
[1:10:18.640 --> 1:10:20.640]  And can't pay their property taxes
[1:10:20.640 --> 1:10:22.640]  They can't have a compact control grid city
[1:10:22.640 --> 1:10:24.640]  Animal ID, premises ID
[1:10:24.640 --> 1:10:26.640]  To shut down the farms and ranches
[1:10:26.640 --> 1:10:28.640]  Where small farms, $20 per chicken
[1:10:28.640 --> 1:10:30.640]  To have a RFID tag
[1:10:30.640 --> 1:10:32.640]  Tyson gets waivers
[1:10:32.640 --> 1:10:34.640]  And has one tag per thousand chickens
[1:10:34.640 --> 1:10:36.640]  Or one tag per building
[1:10:36.640 --> 1:10:38.640]  Now of a half million chickens
[1:10:38.640 --> 1:10:40.640]  I was corrected by some of the farm and ranch groups
[1:10:40.640 --> 1:10:42.640]  And they sent me the documents
[1:10:42.640 --> 1:10:44.640]  It could be per entire complexes
[1:10:44.640 --> 1:10:46.640]  Of 20, 30 buildings with 100,000 chickens
[1:10:46.640 --> 1:10:48.640]  Per building
[1:10:48.640 --> 1:10:50.640]  A fellow who married one of my cousins
[1:10:50.640 --> 1:10:52.640]  And so he lives out on the ranch in East Texas
[1:10:52.640 --> 1:10:54.640]  He was telling me, because he goes and cleans out
[1:10:54.640 --> 1:10:56.640]  Turkey and chicken coops industrially as his business
[1:10:56.640 --> 1:10:58.640]  With these big trucks he owns
[1:10:58.640 --> 1:11:00.640]  He said, no, no, no, it's a tag per complex
[1:11:00.640 --> 1:11:02.640]  Now, but the citizens
[1:11:02.640 --> 1:11:04.640]  $20 tag per chicken
[1:11:04.640 --> 1:11:06.640]  And SWAT teams are hitting them and hitting them hard
[1:11:06.640 --> 1:11:08.640]  In the news
[1:11:08.640 --> 1:11:10.640]  Don't sell those organic eggs on the highway
[1:11:10.640 --> 1:11:12.640]  Don't sell those watermelons, you don't have a license
[1:11:12.640 --> 1:11:14.640]  If you come back, they send in SWAT
[1:11:14.640 --> 1:11:18.640]  SWAT teams in the news
[1:11:18.640 --> 1:11:20.640]  And they don't even come to
[1:11:20.640 --> 1:11:22.640]  They send undercover police to buy the eggs
[1:11:22.640 --> 1:11:24.640]  Or watermelons
[1:11:24.640 --> 1:11:26.640]  Because they want to have it to be in the news to scare everybody
[1:11:26.640 --> 1:11:28.640]  Then they raid the farmer's house
[1:11:28.640 --> 1:11:30.640]  On the news and put them in handcuffs
[1:11:30.640 --> 1:11:32.640]  And seize all their equipment
[1:11:32.640 --> 1:11:34.640]  Folks, this is in the news every week now
[1:11:34.640 --> 1:11:36.640]  So it's a total dehumanization
[1:11:36.640 --> 1:11:38.640]  A total serfdom, a total calling
[1:11:38.640 --> 1:11:40.640]  I want to try now to
[1:11:40.640 --> 1:11:42.640]  Really let Lallan Watt flow with this
[1:11:42.640 --> 1:11:44.640]  And break it down
[1:11:44.640 --> 1:11:46.640]  Where should we start at the end of what they're planning
[1:11:46.640 --> 1:11:48.640]  Or at the beginning or their current operations
[1:11:48.640 --> 1:11:50.640]  Or this driving us off the land
[1:11:50.640 --> 1:11:52.640]  Or why are they moving on every front
[1:11:52.640 --> 1:11:54.640]  In hyperdrive
[1:11:54.640 --> 1:11:56.640]  It looks to me like their system
[1:11:56.640 --> 1:11:58.640]  Isn't in control
[1:11:58.640 --> 1:12:00.640]  And they're kind of winning the race
[1:12:00.640 --> 1:12:02.640]  But their Formula 1 car
[1:12:02.640 --> 1:12:04.640]  Is starting to disintegrate
[1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:06.640]  The pistons are starting to go out
[1:12:06.640 --> 1:12:08.640]  Smokes starting to pour from the engine
[1:12:08.640 --> 1:12:10.640]  Or do you disagree? Do you think things are going according to plan?
[1:12:10.640 --> 1:12:12.640]  I think really they're going to
[1:12:12.640 --> 1:12:14.640]  Plan because this is the century
[1:12:14.640 --> 1:12:16.640]  For change and what they're talking about
[1:12:16.640 --> 1:12:18.640]  Of course is this totalitarian world regime
[1:12:18.640 --> 1:12:20.640]  And when you go as far back
[1:12:20.640 --> 1:12:22.640]  As the United Nations and then the League of Nations
[1:12:22.640 --> 1:12:24.640]  The precursor
[1:12:24.640 --> 1:12:26.640]  They set up a department for agriculture
[1:12:26.640 --> 1:12:28.640]  For instance, in fact
[1:12:28.640 --> 1:12:30.640]  They set up a department for everything
[1:12:30.640 --> 1:12:32.640]  That you need personally to live
[1:12:32.640 --> 1:12:34.640]  To sustain your own life
[1:12:34.640 --> 1:12:36.640]  Because the world is set to bring in
[1:12:36.640 --> 1:12:38.640]  As one where the common people
[1:12:38.640 --> 1:12:40.640]  Are ruled and guide their own lives
[1:12:40.640 --> 1:12:42.640]  It would be done by experts
[1:12:42.640 --> 1:12:44.640]  And all private property
[1:12:44.640 --> 1:12:46.640]  Eventually and all foodstuffs
[1:12:46.640 --> 1:12:48.640]  And all water would be
[1:12:48.640 --> 1:12:50.640]  Given over to these
[1:12:50.640 --> 1:12:52.640]  Quasi
[1:12:52.640 --> 1:12:54.640]  Private organizations
[1:12:54.640 --> 1:12:56.640]  That really is what Carol quickly was talking about
[1:12:56.640 --> 1:12:58.640]  In tragedy and hope
[1:12:58.640 --> 1:13:00.640]  A new feudal type system
[1:13:00.640 --> 1:13:02.640]  These big organizations to do with food
[1:13:02.640 --> 1:13:04.640]  And all energy and resources
[1:13:04.640 --> 1:13:06.640]  Are all part of one
[1:13:06.640 --> 1:13:08.640]  Military industrial complex
[1:13:08.640 --> 1:13:10.640]  At the United Nations
[1:13:10.640 --> 1:13:12.640]  They set up their charter
[1:13:12.640 --> 1:13:14.640]  One of their major speeches when they opened it
[1:13:14.640 --> 1:13:16.640]  They actually opened up the department
[1:13:16.640 --> 1:13:18.640]  For agriculture for the UN
[1:13:18.640 --> 1:13:20.640]  They said that farming was too important
[1:13:20.640 --> 1:13:22.640]  To be left to farmers
[1:13:22.640 --> 1:13:24.640]  In other words, it was to be left
[1:13:24.640 --> 1:13:26.640]  To the big agri-food businesses
[1:13:26.640 --> 1:13:28.640]  And that's what we've been watching for years now
[1:13:28.640 --> 1:13:30.640]  As the big agri-businesses take over
[1:13:30.640 --> 1:13:32.640]  And put the small guys under
[1:13:32.640 --> 1:13:34.640]  With the help of governments
[1:13:34.640 --> 1:13:36.640]  We've been taxing farmers
[1:13:36.640 --> 1:13:38.640]  Bring restrictions on them
[1:13:38.640 --> 1:13:40.640]  To do with pollution and all the rest of it
[1:13:40.640 --> 1:13:42.640]  And gradually getting them off the land
[1:13:42.640 --> 1:13:44.640]  In comes the big boys
[1:13:44.640 --> 1:13:46.640]  And they take them over for peanuts
[1:13:46.640 --> 1:13:48.640]  So it's going to strategy exactly
[1:13:48.640 --> 1:13:50.640]  As they plan it to be
[1:13:50.640 --> 1:13:52.640]  This is the century of change
[1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:54.640]  Where everything in their centuries
[1:13:54.640 --> 1:13:56.640]  Of planning will come to fruition
[1:13:56.640 --> 1:13:58.640]  They think that's what they truly believe
[1:13:58.640 --> 1:14:00.640]  And they're in a role right now
[1:14:00.640 --> 1:14:02.640]  There's restrictions coming on everything
[1:14:02.640 --> 1:14:04.640]  Across the board right now
[1:14:04.640 --> 1:14:06.640]  And we're being trained
[1:14:06.640 --> 1:14:08.640]  And desensitized and trained
[1:14:08.640 --> 1:14:10.640]  And trained to just accept
[1:14:10.640 --> 1:14:12.640]  And go along with everything that's given to us
[1:14:12.640 --> 1:14:14.640]  And whenever a panel of experts
[1:14:14.640 --> 1:14:16.640]  Speak on the environment or whatever
[1:14:16.640 --> 1:14:18.640]  We're supposed to just believe it like that
[1:14:18.640 --> 1:14:20.640]  Like it's the gospel truth
[1:14:20.640 --> 1:14:22.640]  They are the new priesthood
[1:14:22.640 --> 1:14:24.640]  This is the new religion
[1:14:24.640 --> 1:14:26.640]  And we find that Gorbachev
[1:14:26.640 --> 1:14:28.640]  In one of his own books said
[1:14:28.640 --> 1:14:30.640]  After saying that he was an atheist
[1:14:30.640 --> 1:14:32.640]  He said we are creating a new world religion
[1:14:32.640 --> 1:14:34.640]  And it must be based
[1:14:34.640 --> 1:14:36.640]  On a form of earth worship
[1:14:36.640 --> 1:14:38.640]  That's called environmentalism
[1:14:38.640 --> 1:14:40.640]  That's what they're using
[1:14:40.640 --> 1:14:42.640]  Along with the purse
[1:14:42.640 --> 1:14:44.640]  The power of the purse and taxation
[1:14:44.640 --> 1:14:46.640]  And finding that are reinforced
[1:14:46.640 --> 1:14:48.640]  By government laws
[1:14:48.640 --> 1:14:50.640]  So it's working all
[1:14:50.640 --> 1:14:52.640]  Tied so perfectly well together
[1:14:52.640 --> 1:14:54.640]  Mesh together all at the same time
[1:14:54.640 --> 1:14:56.640]  Worldwide whatever happens in the US
[1:14:56.640 --> 1:14:58.640]  Is happening in Australia at the same time
[1:14:58.640 --> 1:15:00.640]  For instance
[1:15:00.640 --> 1:15:02.640]  And this is not your opinion
[1:15:02.640 --> 1:15:04.640]  It's all on record in thousands of public volumes
[1:15:04.640 --> 1:15:06.640]  They've been building it
[1:15:06.640 --> 1:15:08.640]  For centuries off the British imperial model
[1:15:08.640 --> 1:15:10.640]  That took from the Roman and many others
[1:15:10.640 --> 1:15:12.640]  Openly studied at the imperial academies
[1:15:12.640 --> 1:15:14.640]  As you know
[1:15:14.640 --> 1:15:16.640]  And they keep tweaking it and refining it
[1:15:16.640 --> 1:15:18.640]  And people say well how can this go on for generations
[1:15:18.640 --> 1:15:20.640]  Carol Quigley and many others explain that
[1:15:20.640 --> 1:15:22.640]  How does a university go on for 500 years
[1:15:22.640 --> 1:15:24.640]  How does a royal family go on
[1:15:24.640 --> 1:15:26.640]  For 500 a thousand years
[1:15:26.640 --> 1:15:28.640]  These are institutions
[1:15:28.640 --> 1:15:30.640]  That grow and expand and always
[1:15:30.640 --> 1:15:32.640]  Fine tune their science of propaganda
[1:15:32.640 --> 1:15:34.640]  Their science of feudalism
[1:15:34.640 --> 1:15:36.640]  Their science of serfdom
[1:15:36.640 --> 1:15:38.640]  As you know there are 2000 year old Julius Caesar
[1:15:38.640 --> 1:15:40.640]  Manuals
[1:15:40.640 --> 1:15:42.640]  2050 plus year old manuals
[1:15:42.640 --> 1:15:44.640]  On how to control populations
[1:15:44.640 --> 1:15:46.640]  That are very sophisticated
[1:15:46.640 --> 1:15:48.640]  But nothing compared
[1:15:48.640 --> 1:15:50.640]  To the scientific sophistication now
[1:15:50.640 --> 1:15:52.640]  That we're facing
[1:15:52.640 --> 1:15:54.640]  And what we're seeing too is the incredible
[1:15:54.640 --> 1:15:56.640]  Stiffness between all of these big institutions
[1:15:56.640 --> 1:15:58.640]  And so called
[1:15:58.640 --> 1:16:00.640]  Non-governmental organizations
[1:16:00.640 --> 1:16:02.640]  It's a flawless web
[1:16:02.640 --> 1:16:04.640]  That all on board together on the same topics
[1:16:04.640 --> 1:16:06.640]  And when you join one of these groups
[1:16:06.640 --> 1:16:08.640]  You have to accept all the other groups
[1:16:08.640 --> 1:16:10.640]  Mandates as well
[1:16:10.640 --> 1:16:12.640]  Regardless put your own personal
[1:16:12.640 --> 1:16:14.640]  Thoughts to the side
[1:16:14.640 --> 1:16:16.640]  And you must be politically correct
[1:16:16.640 --> 1:16:18.640]  On every single topic
[1:16:18.640 --> 1:16:20.640]  Today
[1:16:20.640 --> 1:16:22.640]  Total political correctness
[1:16:22.640 --> 1:16:24.640]  Must go along with the environment
[1:16:24.640 --> 1:16:26.640]  Global warming
[1:16:26.640 --> 1:16:28.640]  How it must restrict all our movements
[1:16:28.640 --> 1:16:30.640]  All our travel because of global warming
[1:16:30.640 --> 1:16:32.640]  Regardless of the NGO
[1:16:32.640 --> 1:16:34.640]  That you sign on for initially
[1:16:36.640 --> 1:16:38.640]  And what they call it too
[1:16:38.640 --> 1:16:40.640]  Is consensus building
[1:16:40.640 --> 1:16:42.640]  They even have think tanks
[1:16:42.640 --> 1:16:44.640]  That if you're talking about institutions
[1:16:44.640 --> 1:16:46.640]  And having gone for centuries
[1:16:46.640 --> 1:16:48.640]  Quickly said that
[1:16:48.640 --> 1:16:50.640]  If they set up an institution with a mandate
[1:16:50.640 --> 1:16:52.640]  And retire generations
[1:16:52.640 --> 1:16:54.640]  Generations of people
[1:16:54.640 --> 1:16:56.640]  All working on the same mandate
[1:16:56.640 --> 1:16:58.640]  So something that was started 200 years ago
[1:16:58.640 --> 1:17:00.640]  Has gone on continuously
[1:17:00.640 --> 1:17:02.640]  Working on the same mandate
[1:17:02.640 --> 1:17:04.640]  Speciality for 200 odd years
[1:17:04.640 --> 1:17:06.640]  And they install profitability
[1:17:06.640 --> 1:17:08.640]  They use environmentalism as a tax
[1:17:08.640 --> 1:17:10.640]  To fund themselves, it's really feudalism
[1:17:10.640 --> 1:17:12.640]  And then as they expand it
[1:17:12.640 --> 1:17:14.640]  They're getting rich and more powerful themselves
[1:17:14.640 --> 1:17:16.640]  Through each phase
[1:17:16.640 --> 1:17:18.640]  Almost like a coral reef
[1:17:18.640 --> 1:17:20.640]  Incredible that there's a Google video up there
[1:17:20.640 --> 1:17:22.640]  I have the link for it
[1:17:22.640 --> 1:17:24.640]  Where you'll hear Maurice Strong
[1:17:24.640 --> 1:17:26.640]  Introduce Baron Rothschild
[1:17:26.640 --> 1:17:28.640]  And Baron Rothschild stands up at this
[1:17:28.640 --> 1:17:30.640]  World
[1:17:30.640 --> 1:17:32.640]  Climate change conference and so on
[1:17:32.640 --> 1:17:34.640]  And says we need another bank
[1:17:34.640 --> 1:17:36.640]  To deal
[1:17:36.640 --> 1:17:38.640]  That the public will have to be funded
[1:17:38.640 --> 1:17:40.640]  By their tax money by the way
[1:17:40.640 --> 1:17:42.640]  But we need another bank to deal with
[1:17:42.640 --> 1:17:44.640]  Environment
[1:17:44.640 --> 1:17:46.640]  Well of course the banks already be given a name
[1:17:46.640 --> 1:17:48.640]  To handle the money
[1:17:48.640 --> 1:17:50.640]  It goes through Rothschild's private bank
[1:17:50.640 --> 1:17:52.640]  In Switzerland about 8 or 9
[1:17:52.640 --> 1:17:54.640]  Of these United Nations
[1:17:54.640 --> 1:17:56.640]  So-called viral banks
[1:17:56.640 --> 1:17:58.640]  Are all run through Rothschild's private bank
[1:17:58.640 --> 1:18:00.640]  Well take Al Gore
[1:18:00.640 --> 1:18:02.640]  First he denied last year in Congress
[1:18:02.640 --> 1:18:04.640]  That he was getting money
[1:18:04.640 --> 1:18:06.640]  Through Gore and Blood
[1:18:06.640 --> 1:18:08.640]  No pun intended
[1:18:08.640 --> 1:18:10.640]  One of the big climate fencing companies
[1:18:10.640 --> 1:18:12.640]  And that's got NM Rothschild funding in the news
[1:18:12.640 --> 1:18:14.640]  First he said it was all a lie
[1:18:14.640 --> 1:18:16.640]  And the video he goes so what
[1:18:16.640 --> 1:18:18.640]  I'm allowed to make money doing good
[1:18:18.640 --> 1:18:20.640]  So now he just admits
[1:18:20.640 --> 1:18:22.640]  That he's going to get the money
[1:18:22.640 --> 1:18:24.640]  We're openly paying it to him
[1:18:24.640 --> 1:18:26.640]  Yes that's correct
[1:18:26.640 --> 1:18:28.640]  This is a new feudal system
[1:18:28.640 --> 1:18:30.640]  This is a feudal system
[1:18:30.640 --> 1:18:32.640]  These are the new overlords
[1:18:32.640 --> 1:18:34.640]  Who with the collusion of governments
[1:18:34.640 --> 1:18:36.640]  Have given themselves the right to lord
[1:18:36.640 --> 1:18:38.640]  Over the public
[1:18:38.640 --> 1:18:40.640]  And as I say they're taking over everything
[1:18:40.640 --> 1:18:42.640]  You need individually
[1:18:42.640 --> 1:18:44.640]  And live on this planet
[1:18:44.640 --> 1:18:46.640]  We'll have to go to them cap and hand
[1:18:46.640 --> 1:18:48.640]  For water, food, energy
[1:18:48.640 --> 1:18:50.640]  Everything we need
[1:18:50.640 --> 1:19:18.640]  It's a new form of slavery
[1:19:18.640 --> 1:19:20.640]  This is all they're obsessed with
[1:19:20.640 --> 1:19:22.640]  Yes it is
[1:19:22.640 --> 1:19:24.640]  And unfortunately as we know
[1:19:24.640 --> 1:19:26.640]  With this odd situation that people cannot figure out
[1:19:26.640 --> 1:19:28.640]  Where governments bow to these
[1:19:28.640 --> 1:19:30.640]  Titers, these private NGOs
[1:19:30.640 --> 1:19:32.640]  And foundations
[1:19:32.640 --> 1:19:34.640]  And do what they're told
[1:19:34.640 --> 1:19:36.640]  That tells you there is a parallel government
[1:19:36.640 --> 1:19:38.640]  That exists above the ones that we think
[1:19:38.640 --> 1:19:40.640]  We elect
[1:19:40.640 --> 1:19:42.640]  And they want you dead folks
[1:19:42.640 --> 1:19:44.640]  They don't even want to tax you
[1:19:44.640 --> 1:19:46.640]  And control you, they want you dead
[1:19:46.640 --> 1:19:48.640]  They want to control freak genocide, culling
[1:19:48.640 --> 1:19:50.640]  Wiping you out so they can inherit
[1:19:50.640 --> 1:19:52.640]  The new world order promised land
[1:19:52.640 --> 1:19:54.640]  Most of you listening, they're gonna kill you
[1:19:54.640 --> 1:20:20.640]  That's just a fact

[1:22:02.640 --> 1:22:04.640]  In the near future
[1:22:04.640 --> 1:22:08.640]  Earth is dominated by a powerful world government
[1:22:08.640 --> 1:22:10.640]  It's known as the Builderberg
[1:22:10.640 --> 1:22:14.640]  Could their objective be world domination?
[1:22:14.640 --> 1:22:16.640]  For thousands of years their dark order grew
[1:22:16.640 --> 1:22:20.640]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order
[1:22:20.640 --> 1:22:24.640]  Their great dream of exterminating 80% of humanity
[1:22:24.640 --> 1:22:26.640]  Is at hand
[1:22:28.640 --> 1:22:30.640]  For the first time in history
[1:22:30.640 --> 1:22:32.640]  The elites plan for world government

[1:22:36.640 --> 1:22:38.640]  New world order agenda
[1:22:38.640 --> 1:22:40.640]  Builderberg is making great progress toward a world government
[1:22:40.640 --> 1:22:42.640]  Most people have no idea, they're not after money
[1:22:42.640 --> 1:22:44.640]  They have all the money they need, they're after power
[1:22:44.640 --> 1:22:46.640]  That's their happenings

[1:22:56.640 --> 1:23:22.640]  You have been warned
[1:23:22.640 --> 1:23:26.640]  Are you prepared for the next round of storm related outages
[1:23:26.640 --> 1:23:28.640]  Or government created blackouts?
[1:23:28.640 --> 1:23:30.640]  Have you ever thought about taking steps to get off the grid
[1:23:30.640 --> 1:23:34.640]  And generate your own private supply of electrical power?
[1:23:34.640 --> 1:23:38.640]  If so, this will be the most important information you have ever heard
[1:23:38.640 --> 1:23:40.640]  Solar powered generators are finally available
[1:23:40.640 --> 1:23:42.640]  They have no moving parts to wear out or break
[1:23:42.640 --> 1:23:46.640]  And require absolutely no gas whatsoever
[1:23:46.640 --> 1:23:48.640]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun
[1:23:48.640 --> 1:23:50.640]  So go to mysolarbackup.com
[1:23:50.640 --> 1:23:52.640]  That's mysolarbackup.com
[1:23:52.640 --> 1:23:58.640]  Check out mysolarbackup.com before you lose your power
[1:23:58.640 --> 1:24:22.640]  We've got that link, we're going to post it up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com
[1:24:22.640 --> 1:24:28.640]  It's daily where Maury Strong's saying all these horrible things about the New World Order
[1:24:28.640 --> 1:24:32.640]  And international bankers calling his cannon fodder, the population
[1:24:32.640 --> 1:24:34.640]  Alan, tell folks some of the things that are in this video
[1:24:34.640 --> 1:24:38.640]  You've also got it linked up on prisonplanet.com
[1:24:38.640 --> 1:24:42.640]  Tell folks some of the things they say on this video
[1:24:42.640 --> 1:24:48.640]  George Hunt is a business to do with the environmental friendly products and so on
[1:24:48.640 --> 1:24:54.640]  So he goes to these meetings for the environment where Maury Strong goes and Rothschilds go
[1:24:54.640 --> 1:24:58.640]  And you'll hear Maury Strong on two occasions, two clips within that video
[1:24:58.640 --> 1:25:00.640]  Introduce Lord Rothschild
[1:25:00.640 --> 1:25:08.640]  And Lord Rothschild comes on and basically advocates for another United Nations fund to be set up
[1:25:08.640 --> 1:25:12.640]  Another special bank to deal with the environment
[1:25:12.640 --> 1:25:14.640]  One in many that's already there
[1:25:14.640 --> 1:25:18.640]  And Rothschild, of course, you find in the clip
[1:25:18.640 --> 1:25:22.640]  This bank you want to set up, funded by our tax money, is penalties against the environment
[1:25:22.640 --> 1:25:27.640]  We'll go through Rothschild's private bank, the family bank in Switzerland
[1:25:27.640 --> 1:25:29.640]  So he'll be in charge of it
[1:25:29.640 --> 1:25:33.640]  This multi-trillionaire doesn't need money
[1:25:33.640 --> 1:25:40.640]  But here he is handling everyone else's money in the forms of penalization against the environment
[1:25:40.640 --> 1:25:43.640]  It's just astonishing
[1:25:43.640 --> 1:25:46.640]  And tell folks some of the other things that Maury Strong says in here
[1:25:46.640 --> 1:25:51.640]  Well, Maury Strong, of course, as we know, was picked up by Rockefeller himself
[1:25:51.640 --> 1:25:53.640]  Grooming Trump from a young boy
[1:25:53.640 --> 1:25:58.640]  And he's been in that, God knows, on many top United Nations positions
[1:25:58.640 --> 1:26:03.640]  Currently, he's set up by the United Nations to even further the integration of East and West
[1:26:03.640 --> 1:26:07.640]  And China, he lives in China at the moment, but still working for the UN
[1:26:07.640 --> 1:26:13.640]  He's been in charge, he's the one who set up the biodiversity treaty on behalf of Rockefeller
[1:26:13.640 --> 1:26:16.640]  We're all under it now, this biodiversity treaty
[1:26:16.640 --> 1:26:20.640]  We have no rights at all as humans and every insect on the planet
[1:26:20.640 --> 1:26:23.640]  That was elevated much, much higher than we are
[1:26:23.640 --> 1:26:26.640]  And as to do with natural resources
[1:26:26.640 --> 1:26:31.640]  The sharing of natural resources cannot be left into the private hands
[1:26:31.640 --> 1:26:34.640]  It must go into these elitist organizations
[1:26:34.640 --> 1:26:39.640]  That was all done at the Rio, the first Rio conference they had
[1:26:39.640 --> 1:26:42.640]  But Maury Strong, when you go into his history
[1:26:42.640 --> 1:26:47.640]  You'll find this in public broadcasting networks in the television sector
[1:26:47.640 --> 1:26:49.640]  They did a documentary on him
[1:26:49.640 --> 1:26:55.640]  And when he was in China, he went to a graveyard to put flowers at his aunt's grave
[1:26:55.640 --> 1:26:59.640]  And she was the best advisor to Massey Tong
[1:26:59.640 --> 1:27:05.640]  These families are international intergenerational revolutionaries for this new world order
[1:27:05.640 --> 1:27:07.640]  It runs in their family
[1:27:07.640 --> 1:27:11.640]  Well, that's why in 76, the huge editorial written by David Rockefeller saying
[1:27:11.640 --> 1:27:15.640]  Mal did a great job killing 60 plus million people
[1:27:15.640 --> 1:27:17.640]  I mean, they're proud of their mass murder
[1:27:17.640 --> 1:27:19.640]  Yes, they are
[1:27:19.640 --> 1:27:26.640]  And they also highly laud the population reduction for abortions, mandatory abortions in China
[1:27:26.640 --> 1:27:30.640]  And remember, they have said personally, and the United Nations has also said
[1:27:30.640 --> 1:27:34.640]  That China is the model state for the world to follow
[1:27:34.640 --> 1:27:37.640]  We've also followed their policies
[1:27:40.640 --> 1:27:44.640]  Continue with what they plan to do to us on record
[1:27:44.640 --> 1:27:46.640]  It's certainly open now
[1:27:46.640 --> 1:27:50.640]  There's a whole bunch of British newspapers came out about a month ago
[1:27:50.640 --> 1:27:53.640]  I read them on the air mainstream media
[1:27:53.640 --> 1:27:59.640]  And the optimum population crossed another big non-governmental organization
[1:27:59.640 --> 1:28:03.640]  Backed by the foundations that came out and called the same policies as China
[1:28:03.640 --> 1:28:06.640]  To be mandated in Britain and the rest of Europe
[1:28:06.640 --> 1:28:08.640]  Very shortly
[1:28:08.640 --> 1:28:12.640]  They got front-page coverage, whole pages on this
[1:28:12.640 --> 1:28:17.640]  And the government has some of these characters on their board
[1:28:17.640 --> 1:28:19.640]  You know, the governments appoint people
[1:28:19.640 --> 1:28:22.640]  The real players are appointed, they're not elections
[1:28:22.640 --> 1:28:26.640]  And they appoint the top of these groups on their panels for discussion
[1:28:26.640 --> 1:28:30.640]  And then they implement policies and laws that affect us
[1:28:30.640 --> 1:28:33.640]  So we're not run by any kind of democracy whatsoever
[1:28:33.640 --> 1:28:35.640]  Democracy is a sham
[1:28:35.640 --> 1:28:41.640]  In fact, democracy is just the staging rockets to allow these NGO boys
[1:28:41.640 --> 1:28:46.640]  The real power of government to get on board with government and dictate to them
[1:28:46.640 --> 1:28:50.640]  And let's be clear, these videos of George Hunt that we've been posting for years
[1:28:50.640 --> 1:28:54.640]  A lot of times he's the one even leading the meetings with Maurice Strong there
[1:28:54.640 --> 1:28:57.640]  And he was there and they started talking about getting rid of all of us
[1:28:57.640 --> 1:28:59.640]  And this freaked him out so he brought him out
[1:28:59.640 --> 1:29:05.640]  But just bone-shelling to then see the New York Times and Washington Post
[1:29:05.640 --> 1:29:10.640]  Every week with articles about, oh look, the fifth grader comes home and writes up dossiers on mom
[1:29:10.640 --> 1:29:15.640]  And the school has the kids in England and the U.S. writing mock tickets to their parents
[1:29:15.640 --> 1:29:18.640]  For taking a hot bath or having the wrong kind of light bulb
[1:29:18.640 --> 1:29:23.640]  Or using too much A.C. to the children, the little persecutors now
[1:29:23.640 --> 1:29:27.640]  And the parents are in the news going, oh, I'm so proud of them tattling on me
[1:29:27.640 --> 1:29:33.640]  Just like in 1984 where Winston's upstairs neighbor is so proud of his kid
[1:29:33.640 --> 1:29:36.640]  That's tattling on him and then even when he gets picked up and put in the prison
[1:29:36.640 --> 1:29:39.640]  He goes, I'm so proud that my son turned me in
[1:29:39.640 --> 1:29:42.640]  I don't know what it is that I did but I'm sure I'm guilty
[1:29:42.640 --> 1:29:44.640]  I'm glad Big Brother's gonna torture me to death
[1:29:44.640 --> 1:29:48.640]  And that's basically what the American people in bricks are like now
[1:29:48.640 --> 1:29:50.640]  It's like, thank God the kids are turning us in
[1:29:50.640 --> 1:29:53.640]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run
[1:29:53.640 --> 1:30:22.640]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[1:30:23.640 --> 1:30:27.640]  have proven itself to be a formidable weapon against bio threats of today and tomorrow

[1:33:04.640 --> 1:33:07.640]  Well, it's not funny, it's tragic, we're on the same page
[1:33:07.640 --> 1:33:09.640]  By Alan Watt, because I have a clip
[1:33:09.640 --> 1:33:15.640]  I ran into a bunch of clips of him talking about licenses to have even one kid
[1:33:15.640 --> 1:33:19.640]  Total control, that's the goal of the different United Nations
[1:33:19.640 --> 1:33:22.640]  That's the goal of the United Nations
[1:33:22.640 --> 1:33:25.640]  That's the goal of the United Nations
[1:33:25.640 --> 1:33:29.640]  Total control, that's the goal of the different United Nations treaties
[1:33:29.640 --> 1:33:31.640]  That's the goal of global warming
[1:33:31.640 --> 1:33:34.640]  Him in the 70s saying global warming is going to kill us
[1:33:34.640 --> 1:33:39.640]  By 2000, we've got to have one child policies
[1:33:39.640 --> 1:33:44.640]  Just incredible, so we're going to go back to Alan Watt here in just a moment
[1:33:44.640 --> 1:33:49.640]  I would add, though, that the preeminent film
[1:33:49.640 --> 1:33:54.640]  Exposing the Globalist Master Plan, their overall agenda
[1:33:54.640 --> 1:33:58.640]  What they have planned for you and your family is my film, Endgame
[1:33:58.640 --> 1:33:59.640]  Blueprint for Global Enslavement
[1:33:59.640 --> 1:34:03.640]  Everybody needs to get this DVD at infowars.com
[1:34:03.640 --> 1:34:05.640]  And make copies of it and get it out to everybody
[1:34:05.640 --> 1:34:09.640]  Because this is the mindset of those that govern the planet
[1:34:09.640 --> 1:34:13.640]  This is their religion, it is what they work for every waking moment
[1:34:13.640 --> 1:34:16.640]  To kill the majority of the world population
[1:34:16.640 --> 1:34:19.640]  And first they've got to build an international straight jacket control grid
[1:34:19.640 --> 1:34:22.640]  Get you dependent in compact cities
[1:34:22.640 --> 1:34:25.640]  All of the culling and sterilization and chemical and biological attacks
[1:34:25.640 --> 1:34:30.640]  And radiological attacks, that's all just been beta testing
[1:34:30.640 --> 1:34:33.640]  Where they were kind of learning how to cook
[1:34:33.640 --> 1:34:38.640]  Like going to chef school, now they've graduated, now they're ready to start the killing
[1:34:38.640 --> 1:34:41.640]  But first they've got to get you fully on your knees and domesticated
[1:34:41.640 --> 1:34:46.640]  So please get Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement at infowars.com
[1:34:46.640 --> 1:34:51.640]  Or call toll free to get it, 888-253-3139-888

[1:34:56.640 --> 1:34:59.640]  And give it to folks at prisonplanet.tv

[1:35:03.640 --> 1:35:07.640]  Suite 100, Austin, Texas, 787-04
[1:35:07.640 --> 1:35:10.640]  Then there's the Obama deception
[1:35:10.640 --> 1:35:12.640]  This shatters the left right paradigm
[1:35:12.640 --> 1:35:14.640]  This is designed for the general public
[1:35:14.640 --> 1:35:17.640]  It's also important viewing for people that are experts on this
[1:35:17.640 --> 1:35:20.640]  But it's really made for people to understand the left and right are controlled
[1:35:20.640 --> 1:35:23.640]  Two false choices and a controlled dialectic
[1:35:23.640 --> 1:35:28.640]  Where the establishment manages both sides of the system
[1:35:28.640 --> 1:35:32.640]  So the Obama deception available on DVD at infowars.com as well
[1:35:32.640 --> 1:35:35.640]  Or again, prisonplanet.tv, see it in super high quality
[1:35:35.640 --> 1:35:38.640]  It's an arsenal of resistance, you can make copies of it
[1:35:38.640 --> 1:35:41.640]  From prisonplanet.tv and the highest quality online
[1:35:41.640 --> 1:35:44.640]  With the DivEx system that play on most DVD players as well
[1:35:44.640 --> 1:35:49.640]  I also want to tell you about a few of the sponsors that are making today's show
[1:35:49.640 --> 1:35:52.640]  One of them is New Silver Solution
[1:35:52.640 --> 1:35:55.640]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from resistance strains
[1:35:55.640 --> 1:35:57.640]  Of deadly bacteria and viruses?
[1:35:57.640 --> 1:36:00.640]  I want you to go to supernaturalsilver.com today
[1:36:00.640 --> 1:36:03.640]  Visit the link on infowars.com to find out more about this incredible new
[1:36:03.640 --> 1:36:05.640]  Take on a silver compound
[1:36:05.640 --> 1:36:08.640]  The New Silver Solution is a natural antibiotic
[1:36:08.640 --> 1:36:11.640]  It has been clinically proven to kill viruses, germs, bacteria, and yeast safely
[1:36:11.640 --> 1:36:15.640]  Silver is one of the oldest antibiotics and this is just atomized
[1:36:15.640 --> 1:36:18.640]  Out of the smallest particle, that's what you want
[1:36:18.640 --> 1:36:22.640]  So new technology has proven to be formidable weapon against bio-threats
[1:36:22.640 --> 1:36:26.640]  The New Silver Solution gel has been shown to disinfect topically
[1:36:26.640 --> 1:36:28.640]  And keep the area sanitized for 4 hours
[1:36:28.640 --> 1:36:32.640]  The New Silver Solution is a highly effective potent nanoparticle solution
[1:36:32.640 --> 1:36:35.640]  That is lethal to bacteria, yeast, and viruses
[1:36:35.640 --> 1:36:39.640]  So you're antibiotics just do bacteria
[1:36:39.640 --> 1:36:42.640]  Or antivirals just do viruses
[1:36:42.640 --> 1:36:44.640]  Silver is good for everything
[1:36:44.640 --> 1:36:46.640]  We've had medical doctors on that have recommended this
[1:36:46.640 --> 1:36:51.640]  So supernaturalsilver.com and see the amazing line of products they have available
[1:36:51.640 --> 1:36:56.640]  At supernaturalsilver.com, supernaturalsilver.com today
[1:36:56.640 --> 1:37:00.640]  And again, one other sponsor here I want to tell you about is mysolarbackup.com
[1:37:00.640 --> 1:37:03.640]  A lot of things have cut off your electrical power, hurricanes, snow, ice storms
[1:37:03.640 --> 1:37:05.640]  Listers should move towards getting off the grid
[1:37:05.640 --> 1:37:07.640]  And here's a good way to start doing just that
[1:37:07.640 --> 1:37:12.640]  A solar power generator is now available from our great sponsor, Solutions from Science
[1:37:12.640 --> 1:37:17.640]  You get an emergency power backup kit which consists of the Power Source 1800 watt generator
[1:37:17.640 --> 1:37:21.640]  And the high efficiency solar panel designed to provide endless electricity
[1:37:21.640 --> 1:37:23.640]  Remember, too, that gas generators need gas
[1:37:23.640 --> 1:37:26.640]  But in the blackout, gas pumps can't pump gas because they run electricity
[1:37:26.640 --> 1:37:29.640]  This is the perfect emergency backup for trouble times
[1:37:29.640 --> 1:37:31.640]  The government doesn't own the sun yet, folks
[1:37:31.640 --> 1:37:32.640]  So make your move today
[1:37:32.640 --> 1:37:35.640]  Mysolarbackup.com, that's mysolarbackup.com
[1:37:35.640 --> 1:37:37.640]  One word, mysolarbackup.com
[1:37:37.640 --> 1:37:40.640]  Or 877-327-0365
[1:37:40.640 --> 1:37:43.640]  Mysolarbackup.com
[1:37:43.640 --> 1:37:45.640]  Okay, thank you, Alan, for holding on
[1:37:45.640 --> 1:37:48.640]  I thank the sponsors that make this whole operation possible
[1:37:48.640 --> 1:37:51.640]  Don't forget to support Alan with his great books and videos
[1:37:51.640 --> 1:37:54.640]  He has it available at www.cutthedthematrix.com
[1:37:54.640 --> 1:37:58.640]  Okay, Alan, again, you keep pausing for me to interrupt, customarily
[1:37:58.640 --> 1:38:00.640]  And I do add, I think, some important points
[1:38:00.640 --> 1:38:04.640]  But I really want you to sit down and continue rolling with their operation, their plan
[1:38:04.640 --> 1:38:07.640]  What's coming next, some of the other facets
[1:38:07.640 --> 1:38:10.640]  Really, I normally guide the interviews
[1:38:10.640 --> 1:38:13.640]  I'd like to sit back and let you follow your fancy
[1:38:13.640 --> 1:38:17.640]  Well, what we have really is a very ingenious plan
[1:38:17.640 --> 1:38:21.640]  That's going to use environmentalism and a war
[1:38:21.640 --> 1:38:25.640]  Remember the Club of Rome, one of the premier think tanks
[1:38:25.640 --> 1:38:28.640]  That not predicts the future, they create the future
[1:38:28.640 --> 1:38:32.640]  They create realities for the upcoming generations
[1:38:32.640 --> 1:38:35.640]  They come up with the ideas and they give it to the lesser think tanks
[1:38:35.640 --> 1:38:40.640]  They find ways to implement the true media and movies and novels to society
[1:38:40.640 --> 1:38:46.640]  Well, they came up in the 1970s with the idea of global warming
[1:38:46.640 --> 1:38:50.640]  And they say in their own book, the two founders say in their own book
[1:38:50.640 --> 1:38:52.640]  The First Global Revolution
[1:38:52.640 --> 1:38:57.640]  That they were looking for a way to unite the entire planet under a warfare scenario
[1:38:57.640 --> 1:39:02.640]  It would have to be warfare because when there's war, like world war going on
[1:39:02.640 --> 1:39:06.640]  The public will allow their rights to be taken away from them
[1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:08.640]  They'll all work together for less
[1:39:08.640 --> 1:39:11.640]  They'll eat less food and rationing and so on
[1:39:11.640 --> 1:39:14.640]  And they have a common purpose, a common cause
[1:39:14.640 --> 1:39:15.640]  As we think they do
[1:39:15.640 --> 1:39:20.640]  And government can then expand and take over various areas of their lives
[1:39:20.640 --> 1:39:23.640]  It didn't interfere before
[1:39:23.640 --> 1:39:26.640]  Just for a war scenario, it had to be dreamed up
[1:39:26.640 --> 1:39:29.640]  And the one that they hit upon was global warming
[1:39:29.640 --> 1:39:32.640]  They said that would fit the bill
[1:39:32.640 --> 1:39:33.640]  That's their own words
[1:39:33.640 --> 1:39:34.640]  That would fit the bill
[1:39:34.640 --> 1:39:36.640]  After looking other ways to do it
[1:39:36.640 --> 1:39:37.640]  That one would fit the bill
[1:39:37.640 --> 1:39:40.640]  Now, when these guys come to a decision like this
[1:39:40.640 --> 1:39:42.640]  And they're unanimous
[1:39:42.640 --> 1:39:45.640]  They never change their agenda
[1:39:45.640 --> 1:39:47.640]  So if it was written 30 years ago, 40 years ago
[1:39:47.640 --> 1:39:49.640]  You can take it to the bank
[1:39:49.640 --> 1:39:50.640]  They will carry it through
[1:39:50.640 --> 1:39:52.640]  Even if a rupture of eyes and snow
[1:39:52.640 --> 1:39:55.640]  They'll still say it's global warming
[1:39:55.640 --> 1:39:59.640]  Now, under the skies of environments and saving the world environment
[1:39:59.640 --> 1:40:01.640]  Because man's a war with environment
[1:40:01.640 --> 1:40:03.640]  That's what they say, man's the enemy
[1:40:03.640 --> 1:40:06.640]  We all have to reduce our populations
[1:40:06.640 --> 1:40:09.640]  Which ties in exactly with the United Nations
[1:40:09.640 --> 1:40:12.640]  They've said that in their own charter
[1:40:12.640 --> 1:40:13.640]  For the Department of Agriculture
[1:40:13.640 --> 1:40:17.640]  The United Nations ultimately will be responsible
[1:40:17.640 --> 1:40:20.640]  For doling out the food to every nation
[1:40:20.640 --> 1:40:22.640]  In a quota system
[1:40:22.640 --> 1:40:26.640]  And eventually they'll use it as a weapon
[1:40:26.640 --> 1:40:28.640]  If you don't reduce your population
[1:40:28.640 --> 1:40:31.640]  Say in the United States, they'll give you less rationing
[1:40:31.640 --> 1:40:35.640]  And of course, even if you try and keep up
[1:40:35.640 --> 1:40:38.640]  Or keep to the right quota of population
[1:40:38.640 --> 1:40:40.640]  They'll give you less next year
[1:40:40.640 --> 1:40:42.640]  Or two years time once you're used to the idea
[1:40:42.640 --> 1:40:44.640]  Until you keep reducing and reducing
[1:40:44.640 --> 1:40:46.640]  And reducing your population
[1:40:46.640 --> 1:40:49.640]  So there's this incentive to have children
[1:40:49.640 --> 1:40:50.640]  And we already see that
[1:40:50.640 --> 1:40:53.640]  California's getting rid of the tax credit for children
[1:40:53.640 --> 1:40:55.640]  Australia's gotten rid of it entirely
[1:40:55.640 --> 1:40:57.640]  And now says in their news
[1:40:57.640 --> 1:41:00.640]  They're going to start taxing having kids
[1:41:00.640 --> 1:41:02.640]  And then they even have parents come on
[1:41:02.640 --> 1:41:05.640]  That are stakeholders, that means they're minions
[1:41:05.640 --> 1:41:07.640]  They always have these little renomab groups
[1:41:07.640 --> 1:41:10.640]  Who represent the population saying, oh, I love it
[1:41:10.640 --> 1:41:12.640]  I think it's a great idea
[1:41:12.640 --> 1:41:15.640]  And I had the British scientist on last year
[1:41:15.640 --> 1:41:18.640]  Who was all over the news calling for wartime
[1:41:18.640 --> 1:41:21.640]  Rationing of food and water and carbon footprints
[1:41:21.640 --> 1:41:26.640]  Water footprints to have laws to make us skinnier
[1:41:26.640 --> 1:41:29.640]  Not eat as much, being fat as bad for the earth
[1:41:29.640 --> 1:41:31.640]  Even being a few pounds overweight
[1:41:31.640 --> 1:41:33.640]  They say you've got to be rail skinny
[1:41:33.640 --> 1:41:36.640]  So a total tyranny, and he's hailed as a great guy
[1:41:36.640 --> 1:41:39.640]  And I had him on, and he basically said
[1:41:39.640 --> 1:41:41.640]  Yes, we're going to control everything you do
[1:41:41.640 --> 1:41:43.640]  And have carbon rationing on eating food
[1:41:43.640 --> 1:41:46.640]  And I had another scientist on
[1:41:46.640 --> 1:41:49.640]  And he said that I would have to be sent to a reeducation camp
[1:41:49.640 --> 1:41:51.640]  If I didn't conform
[1:41:51.640 --> 1:41:54.640]  Absolutely, they've been using techniques for this
[1:41:54.640 --> 1:41:56.640]  For years on children at school
[1:41:56.640 --> 1:41:59.640]  And I would be to go into the adult world as well
[1:41:59.640 --> 1:42:02.640]  And what they're treating us is that we have no privacy
[1:42:02.640 --> 1:42:05.640]  Of course, that government inspectors can come into your home
[1:42:05.640 --> 1:42:08.640]  At any time, regardless if you think you own it or not
[1:42:08.640 --> 1:42:09.640]  And restrict your time
[1:42:09.640 --> 1:42:12.640]  Unisex bathrooms, all of this is about destroying
[1:42:12.640 --> 1:42:15.640]  All privacy, all identity
[1:42:15.640 --> 1:42:18.640]  Anything that's associated with normal biological activity
[1:42:18.640 --> 1:42:21.640]  And the species must be destroyed
[1:42:21.640 --> 1:42:24.640]  Anything in other words that you would naturally fight for
[1:42:24.640 --> 1:42:28.640]  They're creating you not to fight, but just to acquiesce and give in
[1:42:28.640 --> 1:42:30.640]  That's the whole key to getting trained
[1:42:30.640 --> 1:42:33.640]  And under the threat of the environment, the catastrophe
[1:42:33.640 --> 1:42:35.640]  Then they're going to use this
[1:42:35.640 --> 1:42:38.640]  They're already using it, of course, to come into your life
[1:42:38.640 --> 1:42:40.640]  And every single aspect of your life
[1:42:40.640 --> 1:42:42.640]  Right down to what you eat and how much you eat
[1:42:42.640 --> 1:42:44.640]  And are you eating meat
[1:42:44.640 --> 1:42:48.640]  The Royal Society put out a report the other day
[1:42:48.640 --> 1:42:51.640]  Now the Royal Society is an incredible society
[1:42:51.640 --> 1:42:54.640]  It's got a royal charter to exist
[1:42:54.640 --> 1:42:58.640]  And every famous scientist that's ever existed was a member of it
[1:42:58.640 --> 1:43:02.640]  But it also has listed openly in its own records and history
[1:43:02.640 --> 1:43:09.640]  That it was the first totally pre-Masonic scientific institution ever set up
[1:43:09.640 --> 1:43:13.640]  So these guys, literally again, are part of the big think tanks
[1:43:13.640 --> 1:43:18.640]  And help plan the future on a political or social political basis
[1:43:18.640 --> 1:43:23.640]  And they have said that we should start eating red meats
[1:43:23.640 --> 1:43:28.640]  Now what's the Royal Society doing? Telling us to stop eating red meats, you see
[1:43:28.640 --> 1:43:30.640]  Until you tie it in with the agenda
[1:43:30.640 --> 1:43:35.640]  Because we find that H.G. Wells in his book, Utopia
[1:43:35.640 --> 1:43:39.640]  And he was an earlier member of the same organization
[1:43:39.640 --> 1:43:42.640]  He said the world will bring in, will be vegetarian
[1:43:42.640 --> 1:43:44.640]  Completely vegetarian worldwide
[1:43:44.640 --> 1:43:49.640]  You find the same thing in Toffler's book, Alvin Toffler, The Big Futurist
[1:43:49.640 --> 1:43:53.640]  The Pal of Newt Gingrich who gave out his book to every congressman in the U.S.
[1:43:53.640 --> 1:43:56.640]  It's called The Third Wave
[1:43:56.640 --> 1:43:59.640]  And in it he says, the world we shall bring in will be vegetarian
[1:43:59.640 --> 1:44:02.640]  And it must be so, he doesn't say why
[1:44:02.640 --> 1:44:06.640]  So right down to what we eat, vegetarian diet and all the rest of it
[1:44:06.640 --> 1:44:09.640]  Is all planned for us and under saving the environment
[1:44:09.640 --> 1:44:12.640]  With forces of protein, believe you me
[1:44:12.640 --> 1:44:14.640]  Because why protein?
[1:44:14.640 --> 1:44:19.640]  When you look at India, and these guys use histories, very ancient histories
[1:44:19.640 --> 1:44:22.640]  And recent and modern histories as well, to the full
[1:44:22.640 --> 1:44:25.640]  And they always have historians on board and philosophers
[1:44:25.640 --> 1:44:28.640]  You'll find in the top-think tanks
[1:44:28.640 --> 1:44:32.640]  India has been ruled basically by Brahmin
[1:44:32.640 --> 1:44:36.640]  The Brahmin caste or class for thousands of years
[1:44:36.640 --> 1:44:40.640]  And the easiest people to get to obey you
[1:44:40.640 --> 1:44:42.640]  Because sluggish in certain ways and so on
[1:44:42.640 --> 1:44:46.640]  Are people who are malnourished on a very minimal diet
[1:44:46.640 --> 1:44:49.640]  I'm not talking about a full vegetarian diet here
[1:44:49.640 --> 1:44:51.640]  Once they're in charge of your food
[1:44:51.640 --> 1:44:55.640]  You'll find that even the vegetables become restricted and restricted
[1:44:55.640 --> 1:44:58.640]  Until you're missing out on vital amino acids and so on
[1:44:58.640 --> 1:45:02.640]  But you're very compliant, you're not too bright, you do what you're told
[1:45:02.640 --> 1:45:04.640]  You certainly will never rebel
[1:45:04.640 --> 1:45:08.640]  And that's the technique, that's why they want to bring in the vegetarian world
[1:45:08.640 --> 1:45:12.640]  And of course they're very advanced in genetic engineering
[1:45:12.640 --> 1:45:17.640]  And magically they continue to change the different structures
[1:45:17.640 --> 1:45:20.640]  Of GMO, tomatoes, potatoes, corn
[1:45:20.640 --> 1:45:25.640]  Where it sterilizes all the guinea pigs and rats and other rodents
[1:45:25.640 --> 1:45:29.640]  They're feeding them too, and I've had top genetic engineers on
[1:45:29.640 --> 1:45:32.640]  Saying they believe this isn't by accident
[1:45:32.640 --> 1:45:36.640]  So they're going in and making the very food we sterilize us
[1:45:36.640 --> 1:45:41.640]  And we then see the sperm counts dropping, fertility and women plunging
[1:45:41.640 --> 1:45:45.640]  We're the globalist, have been in control the west
[1:45:45.640 --> 1:45:50.640]  We see the death of the west with on average a 1.3 replacement rate
[1:45:50.640 --> 1:45:51.640]  Please continue
[1:45:51.640 --> 1:45:53.640]  Yeah, the weaponized the food
[1:45:53.640 --> 1:45:57.640]  And you see, again, in this world
[1:45:57.640 --> 1:46:01.640]  The world that they decide they're going to bring in an awful long time ago
[1:46:01.640 --> 1:46:04.640]  They said, and this even came out in the Cold War
[1:46:04.640 --> 1:46:06.640]  Different books and so on
[1:46:06.640 --> 1:46:11.640]  They said that not truly big international corporation dealing in technology
[1:46:11.640 --> 1:46:15.640]  Or science could be allowed to be free to go its own way
[1:46:15.640 --> 1:46:19.640]  They even said the Cold War would be won with those countries and nations
[1:46:19.640 --> 1:46:21.640]  With superior sciences
[1:46:21.640 --> 1:46:26.640]  Now remember food comes under warfare, it always has since ancient times
[1:46:26.640 --> 1:46:32.640]  Monsanto and all these big boys that have an ear to presidents and prime ministers across the world
[1:46:32.640 --> 1:46:35.640]  Once again, a special ear, I call it
[1:46:35.640 --> 1:46:40.640]  Dictates to governments as to what they want, and they always get what they want
[1:46:40.640 --> 1:46:47.640]  Now, they're part of the military industrial complex when you go into the history of Monsanto
[1:46:47.640 --> 1:46:52.640]  And the chemical industry in ancient orange and all the rest of it that they've used in past times
[1:46:52.640 --> 1:46:57.640]  To bring hundreds of top genetic scientists together that formerly were working
[1:46:57.640 --> 1:47:01.640]  And the only places they could work, and that was in the warfare industry
[1:47:01.640 --> 1:47:05.640]  You don't bring them together to make a better carrot or a better potato
[1:47:05.640 --> 1:47:09.640]  You do it because you are truly what you eat
[1:47:09.640 --> 1:47:16.640]  Well, look at the one plastic they unified out of hundreds of different formulas that didn't leach
[1:47:16.640 --> 1:47:18.640]  Estrogen-mimicking hormones
[1:47:18.640 --> 1:47:24.640]  They had global adoption in the 60s of the class of plastic that leaches it
[1:47:24.640 --> 1:47:29.640]  And now they admit it's going on and say, well, in a way, that's a good thing
[1:47:29.640 --> 1:47:33.640]  Maybe we should put this in the water to stop you having kids
[1:47:33.640 --> 1:47:38.640]  And they put this on the news now and the yuppies go, yeah, do that to those poor people
[1:47:38.640 --> 1:47:42.640]  Not knowing they're under the gun as well
[1:47:42.640 --> 1:47:49.640]  That's one of their master points is making kind of the low level minions feel like they're part of this predatory power trip
[1:47:49.640 --> 1:47:56.640]  But expanding on that, if you look at the GMO foods
[1:47:56.640 --> 1:48:00.640]  Again, it's been confirmed to be sterilizing people
[1:48:00.640 --> 1:48:05.640]  I want the population to understand that we're not just saying this
[1:48:05.640 --> 1:48:07.640]  This is really happening, go ahead
[1:48:07.640 --> 1:48:14.640]  Well, plus you have, whenever you get something that you would think would be a crisis like
[1:48:14.640 --> 1:48:23.640]  The males of the West being 80% down on sperm count, what's left is almost a motile, it's not moving
[1:48:23.640 --> 1:48:31.640]  And every year for 50 years, departments of statistics like the United Nations and Britain and Canada
[1:48:31.640 --> 1:48:38.640]  Give these same statistics, always dropped even further, then they go in about it, they give this tax on different kinds of cancers
[1:48:38.640 --> 1:48:41.640]  That have exploded since the 1950s as well
[1:48:41.640 --> 1:48:47.640]  And this is all normal now, there's no crisis made about it, well, how come there's no crisis made about it?
[1:48:47.640 --> 1:48:52.640]  It's because it's part of the agenda, that's why they can calmly give you statistics
[1:48:52.640 --> 1:48:58.640]  And without mentioning the obvious, my God, everyone's becoming sterile or dying of cancer, that's the agenda
[1:48:58.640 --> 1:49:01.640]  This is part of the population reduction control
[1:49:01.640 --> 1:49:11.640]  Now, years ago I read an article on Prince Charles, who's like, remember all these, the nobility of Europe and America
[1:49:11.640 --> 1:49:16.640]  America has a nobility, they have their private estates where they have tenant farmers
[1:49:16.640 --> 1:49:22.640]  That's done through the centuries, they've done television shows on them in Britain and elsewhere
[1:49:22.640 --> 1:49:28.640]  They have their own vast herds of angus beef and all the rest of it that do not eat anything that's modified
[1:49:28.640 --> 1:49:33.640]  They have their fields of their meats and the corn and all the rest of it that is not modified
[1:49:33.640 --> 1:49:42.640]  They have their sources of supply, but they're making sure by law that we are going to eat all this modified stuff, the weaponized stuff
[1:49:42.640 --> 1:49:48.640]  Because it's part of the plan, that's the reason for it
[1:49:48.640 --> 1:49:52.640]  Jay Rockefeller, sorry go ahead
[1:49:52.640 --> 1:49:59.640]  Yeah, never mind what I've done, you see we forget too that the most potent drugs ever developed came from plants
[1:49:59.640 --> 1:50:06.640]  You can make plants through anything, we know how far advanced they are to do with brain chemistry
[1:50:06.640 --> 1:50:15.640]  And today with the various high potent drugs they have, they can make plants produce anything, dumb you down, make you passive, obese
[1:50:15.640 --> 1:50:19.640]  Whatever they want, they can really switch the whole chemistry of your body
[1:50:19.640 --> 1:50:24.640]  And that's why you bring bio, genetic bio experts in to make your food
[1:50:24.640 --> 1:50:27.640]  Food is a weapon, always been used as a weapon
[1:50:27.640 --> 1:50:35.640]  Absolutely at the United Nations Food Conference in 1996 in China
[1:50:35.640 --> 1:50:41.640]  The Director General of the Food Program said we will use food as a weapon and we don't apologize for it
[1:50:41.640 --> 1:50:49.640]  When we come back, I'm going to back you up Alan Watt, because there's an entire industry for decades called pharmacological crops
[1:50:49.640 --> 1:50:59.640]  Where they brag, they can make the plants do whatever they want them to do and they're medicalizing them and using them as weapons against us right now
[1:50:59.640 --> 1:51:01.640]  Stay with us, key information
[1:51:01.640 --> 1:51:12.640]  The New World Order Beast is genetically modifying your food, mixing vegetables with animals and now experimenting with viruses
[1:51:12.640 --> 1:51:22.640]  Without a long term food solution, you will have just two options, starves or surrender
[1:51:22.640 --> 1:51:29.640]  All canned food supplies will eventually run out, what then?
[1:51:29.640 --> 1:51:33.640]  Grow your own healthy food and feed your family forever
[1:51:33.640 --> 1:51:37.640]  Survivalistseeds.com is now the nation's largest bulk heirloom seed company
[1:51:37.640 --> 1:51:40.640]  And it's owned by a real patriot, Big John Lipscomb
[1:51:40.640 --> 1:51:47.640]  You can now have an infinite amount of healthy vegetables like a watermelon, a bundle of carrots or tomatoes for a little more than a penny each
[1:51:47.640 --> 1:51:49.640]  Survivalistseeds.com
[1:51:49.640 --> 1:51:55.640]  And now you can go into business with Big John at survivalistseeds.com by becoming an affiliate
[1:51:55.640 --> 1:52:00.640]  See his link at survivalistseeds.com
[1:52:00.640 --> 1:52:06.640]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear
[1:52:06.640 --> 1:52:12.640]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see
[1:52:12.640 --> 1:52:19.640]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people
[1:52:19.640 --> 1:52:23.640]  Well Obama's already fudging, fudged since D1 in this election
[1:52:23.640 --> 1:52:27.640]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[1:52:27.640 --> 1:52:33.640]  Who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs

[1:54:19.640 --> 1:54:28.640]  Coming up, we're going to play some clips of Lord Rothschild and Maury Strong
[1:54:28.640 --> 1:54:33.640]  We also have clips of them talking about how we're cannon fodder
[1:54:33.640 --> 1:54:40.640]  This scum, we've almost got them, look at them, they're almost sterile, they're all dying of cancer
[1:54:40.640 --> 1:54:47.640]  They'll never fight us, look at those police serving us, taking their part of the system
[1:54:47.640 --> 1:54:56.640]  All implanted, when the hormonal fluctuation triggers, it will metastasize
[1:54:56.640 --> 1:55:00.640]  All on record, all laughing at you
[1:55:00.640 --> 1:55:10.640]  They're talking about Republicans and Democrats, labor and Tories, as if there's any little slaves
[1:55:10.640 --> 1:55:22.640]  Alan Watt is our guest, I remember about six years ago, I read on air an AP report about a Texas based company, Protogene
[1:55:22.640 --> 1:55:28.640]  And it said that they had a pharmacological crop that grew live AIDS virus in the corn
[1:55:28.640 --> 1:55:33.640]  And then it had been open air planted and then that they'd violated some rule and so it had to be destroyed
[1:55:33.640 --> 1:55:39.640]  And it also produced a bunch of other things and people called me and didn't believe that they have crops that grow live viruses or bacteria
[1:55:39.640 --> 1:55:46.640]  The BT corn, one of the most popular corns out there, has been linked by major government studies in Germany and Europe
[1:55:46.640 --> 1:55:53.640]  And also in China to killing the honeybees, because it's a live pesticide that has grown in the corn itself and you still eat it
[1:55:53.640 --> 1:55:58.640]  Now this is all the big joke and everything's about sterilization
[1:55:58.640 --> 1:56:05.640]  And so now they're cracking down on organic farming and everything because folks, they mean business, this is life and death
[1:56:05.640 --> 1:56:12.640]  And they are eugenicists and so they have thousands, in fact Google right now for everybody, just minimize that video
[1:56:12.640 --> 1:56:23.640]  Pharmacological crops, that term, pharmacological crops, you'll get millions of hits all announcing, oh this crops got 14 different animal and 10 different plant
[1:56:23.640 --> 1:56:30.640]  And five different insect genes and it produces all these chemicals or it produces a live virus and we harvest it for vaccines
[1:56:30.640 --> 1:56:39.640]  And they can program plants to do whatever they want, then you tell the public, kind of like the famous story of me saying they have spider goats, part spider, part goat
[1:56:39.640 --> 1:56:46.640]  And I had the CEO of the company on in upstate New York at an army base and it produces body armor out of the milk
[1:56:46.640 --> 1:56:51.640]  And I had a guy at Conan's Pizza, I was picking a pizza, come up and poke me in the back and almost start a fight
[1:56:51.640 --> 1:56:56.640]  I used to like you but you're a liar, I took biology at UT and they don't have part spider goats
[1:56:56.640 --> 1:57:04.640]  And I was at Sir at CBS News and he got in my face and kind of almost bowled up and I had to say look, not lying but believe what you want
[1:57:04.640 --> 1:57:10.640]  Alan, they think we're living in 1900, they don't know, this is Buck Rogers
[1:57:10.640 --> 1:57:20.640]  That's right, the Davish person has been given the biggest mind job in this generation than any previous generation ever had before
[1:57:20.640 --> 1:57:28.640]  And Brzezinski is such a massive player in all this but he is an expert on the mind of populations
[1:57:28.640 --> 1:57:35.640]  He was the head of the NAFA for a long, long time, he's been adviser to I think every president behind the scenes
[1:57:35.640 --> 1:57:45.640]  And he said himself that shortly the public, in his own book between two ages, shortly the public will be unable to reason for themselves
[1:57:45.640 --> 1:57:52.640]  They'll truly believe the news media and in fact they'll look at the news media as an extension of the reasoning powers
[1:57:52.640 --> 1:57:58.640]  The media will do the reasoning for them and they've trained people since 1970s that that is so
[1:57:58.640 --> 1:58:04.640]  Well it's the semantic terms too Alan, people can't even understand basic English now
[1:58:04.640 --> 1:58:05.640]  They can
[1:58:05.640 --> 1:58:11.640]  And they think, warning them is showing off, like the yuppie thing is, oh you're telling me there's corruption
[1:58:11.640 --> 1:58:18.640]  Like that, like it's a mental illness, like make believe that if they make believe there's not trouble, it's not there
[1:58:18.640 --> 1:58:25.640]  That's right, and the public too will believe the same thing that you tell them if Barbara Walters comes on and spins it
[1:58:25.640 --> 1:58:30.640]  That's okay, it's suddenly talked about all over, but if you say it, no you're nobody to think
[1:58:30.640 --> 1:58:37.640]  Exactly, it exists when they say it, because they're saying it's good, but when you say it simultaneously doesn't exist
[1:58:37.640 --> 1:58:41.640]  That's double triple things, stay there back in one minute
[1:58:41.640 --> 1:58:46.640]  Thank you for listening to GCN
[1:58:46.640 --> 1:59:11.640]  Live.com today
[1:59:11.640 --> 1:59:16.640]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded, especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[1:59:16.640 --> 1:59:20.640]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again
[1:59:20.640 --> 1:59:24.640]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[1:59:24.640 --> 1:59:28.640]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[1:59:28.640 --> 1:59:34.640]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, a long time sponsor of ours

[2:00:11.640 --> 2:00:16.640]  Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[2:00:16.640 --> 2:00:22.640]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones
[2:00:22.640 --> 2:00:27.640]  The establishment for psychological warfare, one thing they do is they make the yuppies and the know-it-alls
[2:00:27.640 --> 2:00:31.640]  and the general public slaves who aren't even tuned into news
[2:00:31.640 --> 2:00:38.640]  There's the control paradigm of news, but below that there's the strata of people that just watch sports and act cool all day
[2:00:38.640 --> 2:00:42.640]  You know, basically don't even know the three branches of government
[2:00:42.640 --> 2:00:46.640]  They get them to identify with being ignorant, that it's cool to be stupid
[2:00:46.640 --> 2:00:54.640]  In all these teenager movies and TV show, the guy that gets all the girls is the guy that doesn't care about politics or the world or history
[2:00:54.640 --> 2:01:01.640]  till the public becomes Miss Teen South Carolina, who can't even talk
[2:01:01.640 --> 2:01:09.640]  And then, she's honored by the media for being what you're supposed to be like, that it's cool and beautiful to be an empty-headed idiot
[2:01:09.640 --> 2:01:14.640]  who's going happily up the carousel at Logan's Run, you know, to be euthanized
[2:01:14.640 --> 2:01:20.640]  So, they value their ignorance, they value their bondage, they will say
[2:01:20.640 --> 2:01:25.640]  There is no such thing as a new world order for decades, now they announce, oh, it's a new bank of the world, world government
[2:01:25.640 --> 2:01:31.640]  taxes, you'll pay to private banks, and we go, hey, we said that forever, and I've basically had major newspapers tell me
[2:01:31.640 --> 2:01:38.640]  Well, Alex, you're still basically crazy, the stuff exists, but you were just kind of lucky in your schizophrenia
[2:01:38.640 --> 2:01:44.640]  You imagined all this, and now it's happening, but it's good, but you're still crazy, or it goes further
[2:01:44.640 --> 2:01:53.640]  This stuff exists, but it doesn't exist, it exists when the establishment says it, but then it doesn't exist when you say it exists but it's bad
[2:01:53.640 --> 2:01:59.640]  And people value, they kind of get a look like, you know, the general slaves, like, hmm, I don't believe you
[2:01:59.640 --> 2:02:11.640]  I mean, how has that done psychologically from your study, reveling in being idiots, reveling in being conned, reveling in being sterilized, reveling in dying of implanted cancers
[2:02:11.640 --> 2:02:19.640]  Well, again, very good books have been written on this particular type of psychology
[2:02:19.640 --> 2:02:24.640]  to do with the masses. One very old book was simply called Propaganda, written in the 1800s
[2:02:24.640 --> 2:02:29.640]  That was the start of it, and then Bernays picked up on it the nephew of Freud
[2:02:29.640 --> 2:02:38.640]  And people don't even know that Freud's nephews are still advising British governments today on mass psychology, direct descendants from Freud
[2:02:38.640 --> 2:02:48.640]  But Bernays picked up on it, and he knew how to manipulate mass cultures to create what was called a sameness
[2:02:48.640 --> 2:02:57.640]  Because the first step towards government running, the masses, the masses must be the masses, you can have no individuality
[2:02:57.640 --> 2:03:06.640]  Therefore, at the same time, and Bernays, by the way, at 23 years of age, was picked to go with President Wilson to set up the League of Nations
[2:03:06.640 --> 2:03:13.640]  Because they knew this was the embryo for a world government, and right from the beginning they wanted to start
[2:03:13.640 --> 2:03:18.640]  to see how they could get diverse cultures all in the same direction
[2:03:18.640 --> 2:03:24.640]  And he said they would use feminism to break up the family as well, and he's the reason we eat bacon with eggs
[2:03:24.640 --> 2:03:31.640]  They had a feminist walk with cigarettes smoking them, and they said that's even better, then we can kill the women with the cigarettes
[2:03:31.640 --> 2:03:36.640]  But it'll make it cool as we murder them, and the women are like, oh, I'm dying, I love being conned
[2:03:36.640 --> 2:03:39.640]  It's just all just hardcore savage
[2:03:39.640 --> 2:03:46.640]  But they also knew what they did, they broke down man and woman through all the stages of development from childhood onwards
[2:03:46.640 --> 2:03:54.640]  And created massive marketing departments through Madison Avenue to cater to every single age group and gender, etc
[2:03:54.640 --> 2:04:02.640]  With the intent that 50 years down the road they start to bring the differences of the gender into the one same stream
[2:04:02.640 --> 2:04:08.640]  And that's when unisex broke out, the unisex fashion, everything was the same, male and female and so on
[2:04:08.640 --> 2:04:12.640]  They planned this to be at the end of World War I
[2:04:12.640 --> 2:04:18.640]  And that's a cult society, everybody looking the same, everybody talking the same, dressing the same, bowing the global on
[2:04:18.640 --> 2:04:26.640]  And controlling all the other little fake niches and creating fake counter-culture movements to carry new, new world order changes in
[2:04:26.640 --> 2:04:36.640]  To make it trendy and cool to then progress people into the crucible when all it is is a furnace, a blast furnace
[2:04:36.640 --> 2:04:44.640]  I'm like, little mobs, we're just happily flapping in, I love the government, I love the sameness, I'm a trendy, bzzz
[2:04:44.640 --> 2:04:48.640]  You know, right into the flame as they burn to bits
[2:04:48.640 --> 2:04:54.640]  And you can even say, look at the mobs being burned up, you know, look at all the girls dying of Gardasil and they go, shut up, I'm giving my daughter the shot
[2:04:54.640 --> 2:05:01.640]  The daughters are tapping the convulsion, the mother claps, oh, she's dying, oh, I'm liberal, oh, I'm murdering my daughter

[2:08:00.640 --> 2:08:17.640]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[2:08:17.640 --> 2:08:32.640]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones
[2:08:32.640 --> 2:08:38.640]  Okay, we've got Alan Watt with us for the rest of the hour. I've got a lot of news items I want to throw out at him
[2:08:38.640 --> 2:08:43.640]  But I also want to open the phones up starting in the next segment, any issue, any item
[2:08:43.640 --> 2:08:51.640]  If you'd like to ask Alan Watt or myself, again, I'm Alex Jones, your host. The website is ourprisonplanet.tv, jonesreport.com, infowars.com
[2:08:51.640 --> 2:08:54.640]  And many, many others, thealbamadeception.net
[2:08:54.640 --> 2:09:02.640]  Alan, continue in this segment getting into their master plan, but also from your perspective and research
[2:09:02.640 --> 2:09:08.640]  Why they're accelerating their program so much? Because according to a lot of their documents and statements
[2:09:08.640 --> 2:09:14.640]  They plan on having the world tax, world government, world regulation in by stealth by 2000
[2:09:14.640 --> 2:09:18.640]  By most yardsticks, they're about four to five years behind
[2:09:18.640 --> 2:09:24.640]  But overall, they are very optimistic that their new world order is now forming
[2:09:24.640 --> 2:09:33.640]  How does the swine flu tie in? Obviously a federalization, internationalization grid, the UN is now bragging under level six
[2:09:33.640 --> 2:09:38.640]  It's been the entire time commanding the entire structure
[2:09:38.640 --> 2:09:43.640]  They're now saying forced inoculations are coming on every news channel, it's for your own good
[2:09:43.640 --> 2:09:49.640]  Training us we've got to be locked down, we're gay to homeland, Northcom's got to keep you safe
[2:09:49.640 --> 2:09:59.640]  Oh, foreign troops in FEMA national level exercise 2009, they're preparing, working with our military to, quote, deal with American terrorists
[2:09:59.640 --> 2:10:06.640]  This is from FEMA's own website, so right now it looks like they're accelerating the change
[2:10:06.640 --> 2:10:12.640]  As Lenin said, there are times in history when more happens in a month than happened in the previous hundred years
[2:10:12.640 --> 2:10:16.640]  To paraphrase, so they're clearly we're entering a jump point
[2:10:16.640 --> 2:10:23.640]  Are we in the major flux point, the flash point, the jump point of change, or is this acceleration of change
[2:10:23.640 --> 2:10:31.640]  Just a prelude to a bigger cataclysm of massive change coming in the future, and when is that date from your deep research, Alan, what?
[2:10:31.640 --> 2:10:35.640]  Yeah, we're going through the preparation for it now
[2:10:35.640 --> 2:10:44.640]  Since 2001, I always look back and I say, my God, look how many crisis and fake crisis and false crisis we've had since 2001
[2:10:44.640 --> 2:10:53.640]  We've had the environment hit us at the same time, oh my God, the climate change, global warming, and taxes for all of that at the same time
[2:10:53.640 --> 2:10:55.640]  And the terrorists?
[2:10:55.640 --> 2:11:00.640]  Terrorists, they're just everywhere, like the movie Brazil, no one ever finds them, but they're supposedly all over the place
[2:11:00.640 --> 2:11:04.640]  And then the coming pandemics and plagues at the same time
[2:11:04.640 --> 2:11:09.640]  And in the banking crash, they gave us a banking crash just to make sure that we got the message
[2:11:09.640 --> 2:11:16.640]  And then they bailed the banks, and at the same time, they've just come up and said they're going to give billions of dollars to third-world countries
[2:11:16.640 --> 2:11:18.640]  To help their environment and so on
[2:11:18.640 --> 2:11:29.640]  I mean, this is impossible, if this was spread over a 20-year period, with every single event, we have time to think and talk and say, I don't quite grab this, it smells wrong
[2:11:29.640 --> 2:11:39.640]  But once they get the people in a stampeding mold, and that's the training of it, we're being stampeded into simply being spared and obey authority, then they can speed it up
[2:11:39.640 --> 2:11:43.640]  In fact, they must speed it up and give us one incredible scenario after another
[2:11:43.640 --> 2:11:50.640]  In fact, that whole flu drill was a preparation for a real release in the future, is what I said clearly
[2:11:50.640 --> 2:11:57.640]  And then they actually came out and said that, oh, we use this as a drill, it's coming this fall or next, and it's going to kill a whole bunch of you
[2:11:57.640 --> 2:11:59.640]  And we guarantee it
[2:11:59.640 --> 2:12:04.640]  And so will it be a release flu that kills the people, or is it going to be those inoculations?
[2:12:04.640 --> 2:12:15.640]  As they inject people and they get sick and die in front of everyone, we know the guardicelle and the factor-rate and all the other soft-kill murder operations are beta-test of their killing systems
[2:12:15.640 --> 2:12:27.640]  But also beta-testing their response and turning everybody dying of cancer and diabetes into a cause-celeb and balls and everyone wearing ribbons and, oh, your hair is falling out
[2:12:27.640 --> 2:12:33.640]  And when the movie stars, they're all dying too, it's so cool, we're part of it, we get attention
[2:12:33.640 --> 2:12:36.640]  Again, they just put everything into a process
[2:12:36.640 --> 2:12:45.640]  It's all processes, it's techniques actually, and the thing with depopulation, as you say, is we're all in it together
[2:12:45.640 --> 2:12:53.640]  In a war scenario, that's a common slogan you see plastered everywhere, we're all in it together, together, it's all working along the same path
[2:12:53.640 --> 2:12:56.640]  We all suffer together, we're all dying together
[2:12:56.640 --> 2:13:07.640]  And what you've got also in the same time is the cult of celebrity, because the celebrity is really part of culture, creation, and manipulation
[2:13:07.640 --> 2:13:10.640]  Everything comes from the top, what the stars see
[2:13:10.640 --> 2:13:18.640]  In fact, the stars overwrite even the scientists, if you get a famous story about the talk about the environment, the people will just gobble it up and think it's true
[2:13:18.640 --> 2:13:23.640]  So we're managed in a scientific manner perfectly
[2:13:23.640 --> 2:13:32.640]  But the elite don't have total control, because 37,000 top scientists send a detailed paper and a signed petition, but it gets almost zero news coverage
[2:13:32.640 --> 2:13:38.640]  And Al Gore laughs and says they're all conspiracy theorists that think we didn't land on the moon
[2:13:38.640 --> 2:13:50.640]  That's right, and what's remembered too is an ominous thing that people don't generally think about, because we're trained to believe, and we have been deliberately trained to believe that medical profession is just there to help you
[2:13:50.640 --> 2:14:02.640]  When you go into the history of the big factories, the big corporations that create vaccines, you will find that they are part of the military industrial complex
[2:14:02.640 --> 2:14:09.640]  They're on the cutting edge of dealing with the killer viruses and killer bacterium, which is part of bio warfare
[2:14:09.640 --> 2:14:15.640]  They all come out of Cold Springs Harbor and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute and the big medical facilities in England
[2:14:15.640 --> 2:14:20.640]  You'll see the founding directors and then their sons and everybody else are all public eugenicists
[2:14:20.640 --> 2:14:28.640]  It's like the IBM human genome run from Cold Springs Harbor last year, the director comes out and says blacks aren't humans, basically kill them
[2:14:28.640 --> 2:14:34.640]  And I'd already put him in endgame saying he was one of the top technicians coming up with the eugenics op
[2:14:34.640 --> 2:14:38.640]  But the big secret is a lot of racists go good, kill the blacks
[2:14:38.640 --> 2:14:46.640]  What the stupid racists don't understand is the elites are really trying to target northern Europeans, and these are northern Europeans themselves
[2:14:46.640 --> 2:14:51.640]  involved in a lot of this, because they see northern Europeans as their potential competition
[2:14:51.640 --> 2:14:58.640]  Yes, because out of northern Europeans they've always had antagonism, they've always had rebellions
[2:14:58.640 --> 2:15:08.640]  And there's more individuality by nature, it's inherently in the northern Europeans, we're not a collective society as such
[2:15:08.640 --> 2:15:11.640]  We're not like China, a history of collectivism
[2:15:11.640 --> 2:15:16.640]  Therefore, in fact the United Nations has said, and the League of Nations before has said the same thing
[2:15:16.640 --> 2:15:22.640]  Their enemy to world order was individualism, individualism has to be eradicated
[2:15:22.640 --> 2:15:29.640]  But getting back to the laboratories, you look at backster laboratories, now backster laboratories we've got to remember
[2:15:29.640 --> 2:15:34.640]  was paid by governments that are combined with the biowarfare departments
[2:15:34.640 --> 2:15:43.640]  They were paid during World War II to come up with different bacterial and biowarfare ingredients, etc
[2:15:43.640 --> 2:15:49.640]  But they were also part of IG Farben that created the Nazi war machine
[2:15:49.640 --> 2:15:53.640]  They've always been involved in this kind of thing
[2:15:53.640 --> 2:15:59.640]  You cannot be involved in dealing with viruses purely to kill them off
[2:15:59.640 --> 2:16:03.640]  The military is always in hand and glove with you, or hand in hand with you
[2:16:03.640 --> 2:16:08.640]  because you're on the cutting edge of evolving these viruses into killers as well
[2:16:08.640 --> 2:16:13.640]  They are so advanced, they can give you a shot for whatever they tell you, you'll never know what it is
[2:16:13.640 --> 2:16:17.640]  The guy who gives you the shot can analyze it, it's all based on faith
[2:16:17.640 --> 2:16:22.640]  And they can give you a booster down the road that triggers off the first shot and down you go
[2:16:22.640 --> 2:16:26.640]  That's how perfect they have biowarfare
[2:16:26.640 --> 2:16:30.640]  That's called a binary weapon, they actually wrote papers on that
[2:16:30.640 --> 2:16:34.640]  And as you've properly said, and even Dr. Sock bragged about it
[2:16:34.640 --> 2:16:38.640]  When they give you, say, an SV-40 cancer that's been engineered
[2:16:38.640 --> 2:16:43.640]  It's designed that it has certain hormone fluctuation in the body, it triggers
[2:16:43.640 --> 2:16:46.640]  and then starts the replication attacks in the human body
[2:16:46.640 --> 2:16:52.640]  That's right, if your testosterone starts dropping into 30s, well bang, you're done with a cancer at 35
[2:16:52.640 --> 2:16:57.640]  Nah, it's good though, and now we have people at 20 getting their Alzheimer's, it's normal
[2:16:57.640 --> 2:16:59.640]  Yeah, it's not amazing
[2:16:59.640 --> 2:17:03.640]  It's beautiful Alan, something beautiful is about to happen like they say in 2001
[2:17:03.640 --> 2:17:05.640]  That's right, something wonderful
[2:17:05.640 --> 2:17:07.640]  Something wonderful
[2:17:07.640 --> 2:17:12.640]  But that's how it is, and you can understand as I say
[2:17:12.640 --> 2:17:18.640]  These big international corporations and laboratories are all part of a military industrial complex
[2:17:18.640 --> 2:17:24.640]  A book was written after World War II, actually it was written about the 1990s
[2:17:24.640 --> 2:17:33.640]  By a Toronto Star reporter who got hold of lots of declassified information from the Canadian, US and British governments
[2:17:33.640 --> 2:17:38.640]  That all worked together, the book is called Deadly Allies, Canada's Secret War
[2:17:38.640 --> 2:17:45.640]  And those guys, during World War II, and Canada led the field, they could get a common virus
[2:17:45.640 --> 2:17:50.640]  Turn it into a killer within about an hour and what they call the fast breeder
[2:17:50.640 --> 2:17:55.640]  They were so far advanced in World War II, and guess who was all on board working with them?
[2:17:55.640 --> 2:18:00.640]  The same big pharma companies that deal with making your inoculations
[2:18:00.640 --> 2:18:06.640]  And all run by Eugenicist on record, but Alan, shouldn't we just trust them?
[2:18:06.640 --> 2:18:10.640]  That's it, that's the double thing that folks get into
[2:18:10.640 --> 2:18:16.640]  They've got all this propaganda on television, mainly through fiction, television series
[2:18:16.640 --> 2:18:22.640]  Yeah, where the backwards kook, racist, scum, child molester doesn't want to take the shot
[2:18:22.640 --> 2:18:27.640]  Every TV show, every drama, but then the women always figure out on the show
[2:18:27.640 --> 2:18:30.640]  And they make sure the kids get it, and then the kids' lives are saved
[2:18:30.640 --> 2:18:31.640]  That's right
[2:18:31.640 --> 2:18:35.640]  They know best, and that's why they're going to take the Gardasil
[2:18:35.640 --> 2:18:38.640]  They're going to show you Alan, they're not going to listen to you
[2:18:38.640 --> 2:18:43.640]  No, they're with the government
[2:18:43.640 --> 2:18:44.640]  So that's the key to it
[2:18:44.640 --> 2:18:48.640]  As you say yourself, the statistics are out there, we are being sterilized
[2:18:48.640 --> 2:18:50.640]  We've been getting sterilized for not a long time
[2:18:50.640 --> 2:18:55.640]  We know that some of the various culprits that were deliberately put in our food
[2:18:55.640 --> 2:18:57.640]  The bi-spinal, A, and all the rest of it
[2:18:57.640 --> 2:19:03.640]  They even classified melamine, which is a plastic product, as a protein
[2:19:03.640 --> 2:19:05.640]  Oh yes
[2:19:05.640 --> 2:19:10.640]  For baby food, because there's one little part of this molecule in a certain chain
[2:19:10.640 --> 2:19:14.640]  Could be recognized, could be, with a lot of money, helping it along
[2:19:14.640 --> 2:19:18.640]  Exactly, they admitted it attacks all organs, causes kidney failure, causes cancer
[2:19:18.640 --> 2:19:22.640]  Was always listed as deadly, now they came out last year and said, you know what?
[2:19:22.640 --> 2:19:24.640]  Melamine's actually good for your child
[2:19:24.640 --> 2:19:28.640]  Just like they nationwide say mercury's now nutritious Alan
[2:19:28.640 --> 2:19:32.640]  You're a crazy, you're, are you crazy? You don't like mercury?
[2:19:32.640 --> 2:19:36.640]  Yeah, and they actually put the melamine in baby food
[2:19:36.640 --> 2:19:41.640]  And they know darn well it sterilizes the male child very early on
[2:19:41.640 --> 2:19:43.640]  Man, we got a radical on there, folks
[2:19:43.640 --> 2:19:46.640]  He's saying melamine, plastic toxin, and good for babies
[2:19:46.640 --> 2:19:50.640]  He's even saying mercury isn't good, everybody knows vitamin M's good
[2:19:50.640 --> 2:19:52.640]  Man, we're radical, whoa
[2:19:52.640 --> 2:19:55.640]  This show is just incredibly kooky
[2:19:55.640 --> 2:19:57.640]  The government's right, mercury's good
[2:19:57.640 --> 2:20:00.640]  Alan, what? Man, you're extreme
[2:20:00.640 --> 2:20:03.640]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources, July 1st, 2009
[2:20:03.640 --> 2:20:06.640]  Goal open this morning at $939
[2:20:06.640 --> 2:20:11.640]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $965.94, $482.97 for the half ounce
[2:20:11.640 --> 2:20:13.640]  Or $241.49 for a quarter ounce
[2:20:13.640 --> 2:20:17.640]  That's $965.94, $482.97, and $241.49
[2:20:17.640 --> 2:20:21.640]  Failout equals market distortions increase money supply while productivity is going down
[2:20:21.640 --> 2:20:25.640]  Walls readers receiving injections of liquidity while smaller companies are forced to concede
[2:20:25.640 --> 2:20:30.640]  Companies too big to fail are now using the tax dollars to increase market share paying fat dividends
[2:20:30.640 --> 2:20:33.640]  Are you wondering why supplies of gold and silver coins decreasing rapidly?
[2:20:33.640 --> 2:20:36.640]  Leaving the public scrambling to accumulate what's left?
[2:20:36.640 --> 2:20:39.640]  The occurrences values based on trust, fiscal responsibility
[2:20:39.640 --> 2:20:42.640]  Is Congress and the White House acting responsibly, earning your trust?
[2:20:42.640 --> 2:20:44.640]  Or is it time to ensure your hard earned wealth?
[2:20:44.640 --> 2:20:49.640]  Midas Resources offers economic insurance, gold and silver coins, $800.686.2237
[2:20:49.640 --> 2:20:52.640]  Do you believe that more bailout will solve our economic problems?
[2:20:52.640 --> 2:20:56.640]  Or would you like to call Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237?
[2:20:56.640 --> 2:21:00.640]  That's Midas Resources at 1-800-686-2237
[2:21:00.640 --> 2:21:06.640]  In the New World Order's war against humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear
[2:21:06.640 --> 2:21:12.640]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see
[2:21:12.640 --> 2:21:19.640]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest of the American people
[2:21:19.640 --> 2:21:24.640]  While Obama's already fudging, he's fudged since day one in this election
[2:21:24.640 --> 2:21:28.640]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists
[2:21:28.640 --> 2:21:35.640]  Who is imposing the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascist
[2:21:37.640 --> 2:21:40.640]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one world government
[2:21:40.640 --> 2:21:47.640]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda

[2:23:00.640 --> 2:23:05.640]  We have just received news that the IRS is currently accepting reduced settlements on back taxes
[2:23:05.640 --> 2:23:09.640]  And millions of consumers may be eligible for this reduction to save thousands of dollars
[2:23:09.640 --> 2:23:14.640]  If any of you out there owe $10,000 or more in back taxes to the IRS
[2:23:14.640 --> 2:23:23.640]  We have created an open phone line with American tax settlement for all GCN listeners to see if you qualify for a settlement with the IRS to save thousands

[2:23:32.640 --> 2:23:37.640]  Don't risk the IRS coming after you and garnishing your wages or seizing your property
[2:23:37.640 --> 2:23:46.640]  American tax settlement specializes in negotiating with the IRS on your behalf, keeping the IRS off your back and saving consumers millions of dollars

[2:23:59.640 --> 2:24:09.640]  That's 1-800-506-5904
[2:24:09.640 --> 2:24:19.640]  That's 1-800-506-5904
[2:24:19.640 --> 2:24:28.640]  That's 1-800-506-5904
[2:24:28.640 --> 2:24:39.640]  We'll, for God's sakes, find out Gardasil's killing a bunch of people to take it and causing autoimmune problems with other women and it's clearly a sterilization weapon
[2:24:39.640 --> 2:24:47.640]  This isn't a game. Mercury isn't good for you. They think you're so stupid now that they get on the news and say, your child needs mercury
[2:24:47.640 --> 2:24:50.640]  And I've played the news clips here probably 100 times. I'm not going to play it today
[2:24:50.640 --> 2:24:54.640]  You know, they won't believe it. Cue up Mercury, good for you. Get me the YouTube
[2:24:54.640 --> 2:25:01.640]  The point is, I've also got a number where they say lead's good for children. Lead isn't good for children. We're going to go to your calls in a moment
[2:25:01.640 --> 2:25:10.640]  But I have just as a layman studying the psychology, they're trying to shock us. I don't want you to speak to this and we're going to call the next segment, Alan
[2:25:10.640 --> 2:25:15.640]  They're trying to shock us when they say, yes, we're torturing people's children in front of them, but it's to fight al-Qaeda
[2:25:15.640 --> 2:25:22.640]  And then Jack Bauer does it on the TV show 24 and everybody sits there, the new hero, the new John Wayne tortures kids
[2:25:22.640 --> 2:25:27.640]  So it's predictive programming you talk about. You know, they're modeling as social animals off of this
[2:25:27.640 --> 2:25:32.640]  They try to shock you saying on CNBC, lead is good for children and it's good for the economy, quote
[2:25:32.640 --> 2:25:35.640]  Or mercury's good for children, the feds say
[2:25:35.640 --> 2:25:42.640]  They're trying to make it or killing Khalid Sheikh Mohammed five or six times where they captured him or killing chemical Ali 12 times
[2:25:42.640 --> 2:25:49.640]  And killing all these other guys, Zarqawi 14 times and then never retracting the last time they killed him
[2:25:49.640 --> 2:25:57.640]  And CIA openly announcing they're doing a destabilization campaign to stage the election upset two years ago
[2:25:57.640 --> 2:26:03.640]  And then saying we have nothing to do with it and Obama saying I won't sign signing statements and then lying and saying I never said that
[2:26:03.640 --> 2:26:08.640]  I'm going to do it or I'm going to raise all your taxes and saying I never said I wouldn't raise your taxes
[2:26:08.640 --> 2:26:14.640]  I mean, it's their practicing lying to us to kind of bludgeon us into submission
[2:26:14.640 --> 2:26:18.640]  How would you boil down that psychological phenomenon or tactic?
[2:26:18.640 --> 2:26:24.640]  It literally is an extension of what we heard before shock and awe, shock and awe
[2:26:24.640 --> 2:26:30.640]  They use it with the massive bombardment on physical realm or soft bombardment
[2:26:30.640 --> 2:26:33.640]  It's called soft bombardment through massive propaganda
[2:26:33.640 --> 2:26:38.640]  We are hit with conflicting messages on the same topics all the time
[2:26:38.640 --> 2:26:46.640]  And ultimately they know that the public because they're trained will always go ultimately with the expert opinion
[2:26:46.640 --> 2:26:50.640]  And they won't critically think through any opposing opinion
[2:26:50.640 --> 2:26:57.640]  So it's shock and awe on the public, they train the public in fact not to even start to even try to think about something
[2:26:57.640 --> 2:27:02.640]  They're telling you it's too complex for you to understand the expert
[2:27:02.640 --> 2:27:06.640]  Yeah, it's learned helplessness with the studies with the rats or puppies where they shock them
[2:27:06.640 --> 2:27:10.640]  Where they finally just give up in the corner, catatonically, I agree, they're just putting up
[2:27:10.640 --> 2:27:14.640]  They're also saying the precedent that they lie and don't get in trouble for it
[2:27:14.640 --> 2:27:16.640]  They've been doing that for so many years
[2:27:16.640 --> 2:27:19.640]  I mean I get a laugh at people actually chanting slogans
[2:27:19.640 --> 2:27:25.640]  They're given by Madison Avenue like change is good without ever asking what change do you mean
[2:27:25.640 --> 2:27:30.640]  Define change, define the changes, no one ever did
[2:27:30.640 --> 2:27:35.640]  No one ever did and then instead we shall win by slogans, the use of slogans
[2:27:35.640 --> 2:27:41.640]  And it works, it really works because people don't ask, they don't ask beyond slogans
[2:27:41.640 --> 2:27:46.640]  It's like Orwell's an animal farm, the sheep who are taught the slogan
[2:27:46.640 --> 2:27:49.640]  That four legs are good, two legs are bad
[2:27:49.640 --> 2:27:54.640]  And then halfway through it one day the pig is given instructions
[2:27:54.640 --> 2:27:56.640]  He says two legs good, four legs bad
[2:27:56.640 --> 2:28:01.640]  And the sheep automatically parted her off without realizing they've just demeaned themselves
[2:28:01.640 --> 2:28:08.640]  Well exactly, first they go from four legs good, two legs bad to four legs good
[2:28:08.640 --> 2:28:18.640]  Two legs also good to four legs good, two legs better to two legs good, four legs bad
[2:28:18.640 --> 2:28:23.640]  That's right, that's right, until they're still chanting what sounds to them to be the same thing
[2:28:23.640 --> 2:28:27.640]  And they don't critically even analyze what they're saying themselves
[2:28:27.640 --> 2:28:35.640]  And meanwhile with repetition they're actually convincing themselves of the truth of it
[2:28:35.640 --> 2:28:38.640]  Well I was watching HBO this morning, I forgot they have the documentary about free speech
[2:28:38.640 --> 2:28:41.640]  They've been hyping it big time but I'm on the treadmill watching it
[2:28:41.640 --> 2:28:47.640]  And it was all about liberals, we love free speech but the evil right wingers are trying to take everybody's speech
[2:28:47.640 --> 2:28:52.640]  That made it a left-right issue when meanwhile it's the left that just passed through the house
[2:28:52.640 --> 2:28:55.640]  I hate crimes Bill that will completely ban free speech in America
[2:28:55.640 --> 2:28:59.640]  Saying if something you said hurts somebody's feelings it's a federal felony
[2:28:59.640 --> 2:29:04.640]  And then meanwhile it makes it all about how the right wing wants your free speech so we've got to take theirs
[2:29:04.640 --> 2:29:07.640]  Again it's just all complete crap
[2:29:07.640 --> 2:29:16.640]  It is, you are seeing really a perfected technique that was tested and improved under the Soviet system
[2:29:16.640 --> 2:29:21.640]  And I've mentioned so many times that the Reese commission on Senator Norman Dodd
[2:29:21.640 --> 2:29:26.640]  Did find out in the 1950s when they investigated the tax-free foundations
[2:29:26.640 --> 2:29:35.640]  The victim Rockefeller Ford Carnegie, their job was to unite the Soviet system with that of the West
[2:29:35.640 --> 2:29:39.640]  We're seeing Soviet techniques now introduced in the West and a perfected to having perfected
[2:29:39.640 --> 2:29:44.640]  Stay there Alan Watt, we'll be right back on the other side with phone calls and a lot more
[2:29:44.640 --> 2:29:49.640]  Cousinsofmatrix.com, Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv
[2:29:49.640 --> 2:29:51.640]  More, straight ahead, take your mercury
[2:29:51.640 --> 2:29:55.640]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run
[2:29:55.640 --> 2:30:00.640]  This is Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[2:30:00.640 --> 2:30:06.640]  This is Alex Jones and I want to tell you again about a company that has supported us in the truth movement for years
[2:30:06.640 --> 2:30:12.640]  InterHealth Botanicals, this company produces the highest quality superfood around, called InnerFood
[2:30:12.640 --> 2:30:17.640]  My wife just loves the stuff, and now the health ranger Mike Adams has awarded InnerFood
[2:30:17.640 --> 2:30:21.640]  His Editor's Choice Award, or Best Superfood of 2009
[2:30:21.640 --> 2:30:25.640]  InnerFood is loaded with 20 great organic ingredients, no fillers, no sweeteners
[2:30:25.640 --> 2:30:30.640]  It would be impossible to blend this up for a better price, and their formula really works
[2:30:30.640 --> 2:30:33.640]  This is the real thing for the great health you need
[2:30:33.640 --> 2:30:39.640]  Try the Nutra Cafe, their great organic coffee infused with polysaccharides that boosts the immune system
[2:30:39.640 --> 2:30:44.640]  A truly healthy coffee that tastes great, and take it from me folks, it really does taste great
[2:30:44.640 --> 2:30:46.640]  Don't forget to try their other great products

[2:31:00.640 --> 2:31:05.640]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator this summer
[2:31:05.640 --> 2:31:09.640]  1. New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[2:31:09.640 --> 2:31:15.640]  2. Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[2:31:15.640 --> 2:31:20.640]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[2:31:20.640 --> 2:31:24.640]  3. In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:31:24.640 --> 2:31:27.640]  Especially with the high demand summer months ahead
[2:31:27.640 --> 2:31:30.640]  4. The hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again
[2:31:30.640 --> 2:31:34.640]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages
[2:31:34.640 --> 2:31:39.640]  5. A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[2:31:39.640 --> 2:31:43.640]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science
[2:31:43.640 --> 2:31:45.640]  A long time sponsor of ours

[2:31:59.640 --> 2:32:01.640]  This is Alex Jones
[2:32:01.640 --> 2:32:03.640]  Have you heard of the millionaire patriot?
[2:32:03.640 --> 2:32:04.640]  Well, you should
[2:32:04.640 --> 2:32:09.640]  He has a free handgun and 5 days of firearms training waiting for you

[2:32:25.640 --> 2:32:27.640]  In the caliber of your choice
[2:32:27.640 --> 2:32:30.640]  I believe now is the time that you and your family need to be armed and trained
[2:32:30.640 --> 2:32:33.640]  To levels that exceed law enforcement and military standards
[2:32:33.640 --> 2:32:37.640]  Front Sight provides such training without any boot camp mentality
[2:32:37.640 --> 2:32:39.640]  Or drill instructor attitudes
[2:32:39.640 --> 2:32:40.640]  This is real
[2:32:40.640 --> 2:32:41.640]  Don't miss out
[2:32:41.640 --> 2:32:44.640]  Secure a Front Sight defensive handgun course
[2:32:44.640 --> 2:32:47.640]  Plus a 30 state concealed weapons permit

[2:33:05.640 --> 2:33:07.640]  I hear the train come
[2:33:07.640 --> 2:33:09.640]  It's rolling around the bend
[2:33:09.640 --> 2:33:12.640]  And I ain't seen the sunshine
[2:33:12.640 --> 2:33:16.640]  I don't know when I'm stuck in bulls in prison
[2:33:16.640 --> 2:33:19.640]  And time keeps dragging on
[2:33:22.640 --> 2:33:25.640]  But that train keeps rolling
[2:33:25.640 --> 2:33:28.640]  All down to San Antonio
[2:33:28.640 --> 2:33:31.640]  That's called the Mopac Express
[2:33:31.640 --> 2:33:34.640]  And that railway runs right by my office
[2:33:34.640 --> 2:33:36.640]  Right down to San Antonio
[2:33:36.640 --> 2:33:40.640]  Very railroad Johnny Cash is talking about
[2:33:40.640 --> 2:33:44.640]  Just to watch him die
[2:33:49.640 --> 2:33:52.640]  I hang my head
[2:33:52.640 --> 2:33:54.640]  Going back down and watching your phone calls
[2:33:54.640 --> 2:33:56.640]  He's gonna be with us 20 minutes to the next hour
[2:33:56.640 --> 2:33:58.640]  Then I'll blitz through news and information
[2:33:58.640 --> 2:34:00.640]  I want to talk about some solutions with him too
[2:34:00.640 --> 2:34:01.640]  Coming up the next hour
[2:34:01.640 --> 2:34:04.640]  Let's talk to Frank in New York and Chuck Mark
[2:34:04.640 --> 2:34:06.640]  Maddie, Dave and others
[2:34:06.640 --> 2:34:08.640]  Please be quick, I want to take a lot of calls
[2:34:08.640 --> 2:34:09.640]  Frank, you're on the air
[2:34:09.640 --> 2:34:10.640]  Good afternoon, Alex
[2:34:10.640 --> 2:34:17.640]  And Alan, I wanted to just comment briefly
[2:34:17.640 --> 2:34:19.640]  On the show that I heard this morning
[2:34:19.640 --> 2:34:21.640]  I guess rebroadcasted from yesterday
[2:34:21.640 --> 2:34:22.640]  It was excellent
[2:34:22.640 --> 2:34:25.640]  And I was so pleased to hear the young people now
[2:34:25.640 --> 2:34:29.640]  Through the videos and documentaries
[2:34:29.640 --> 2:34:33.640]  Becoming critical in their analysis of
[2:34:33.640 --> 2:34:35.640]  The political discourse and the economic discourse
[2:34:35.640 --> 2:34:37.640]  It's affecting everyone's lives
[2:34:37.640 --> 2:34:41.640]  The reason why I called Alan and Alex
[2:34:41.640 --> 2:34:43.640]  I think you may find this interesting as well
[2:34:43.640 --> 2:34:45.640]  I just have been spending the last two days
[2:34:45.640 --> 2:34:47.640]  Reading the Bank of International
[2:34:47.640 --> 2:34:50.640]  Settlement annual report
[2:34:50.640 --> 2:34:53.640]  For this year called Rescue, Recovery and Reform
[2:34:53.640 --> 2:34:55.640]  The Narrow Path Ahead
[2:34:55.640 --> 2:34:57.640]  And it's rather interesting
[2:34:57.640 --> 2:35:01.640]  Because I had heard the conversation
[2:35:01.640 --> 2:35:03.640]  I guess on Monday
[2:35:03.640 --> 2:35:08.640]  Regarding the person that was paying his bill
[2:35:08.640 --> 2:35:13.640]  With the special rights drawing instrument
[2:35:13.640 --> 2:35:16.640]  And I found it very interesting
[2:35:16.640 --> 2:35:17.640]  Because in the annual report
[2:35:17.640 --> 2:35:22.640]  The ratio of the U.S. dollar to the SDR
[2:35:22.640 --> 2:35:25.640]  Is 1.5
[2:35:25.640 --> 2:35:30.640]  And I think what your guest had said
[2:35:30.640 --> 2:35:34.640]  Regarding his transaction was of 3.1
[2:35:34.640 --> 2:35:36.640]  So apparently it can be floated
[2:35:36.640 --> 2:35:37.640]  At the discretion of the bank
[2:35:37.640 --> 2:35:39.640]  Which is rather interesting
[2:35:39.640 --> 2:35:41.640]  This gives them, for those that don't know
[2:35:41.640 --> 2:35:43.640]  A financial fiat currency
[2:35:43.640 --> 2:35:45.640]  For bank to bank government to government
[2:35:45.640 --> 2:35:46.640]  Institution to institution
[2:35:46.640 --> 2:35:48.640]  Kind of Fortune 100
[2:35:48.640 --> 2:35:50.640]  Between themselves
[2:35:50.640 --> 2:35:51.640]  And then we're all down here
[2:35:51.640 --> 2:35:52.640]  With these regional currencies
[2:35:52.640 --> 2:35:54.640]  And they also manipulate
[2:35:54.640 --> 2:35:56.640]  As part of their insider trading
[2:35:56.640 --> 2:35:58.640]  A completely rigged game
[2:35:58.640 --> 2:36:00.640]  You notice that code word
[2:36:00.640 --> 2:36:01.640]  The narrow path ahead
[2:36:01.640 --> 2:36:03.640]  Meaning dictatorial
[2:36:03.640 --> 2:36:04.640]  They're going to hold everybody
[2:36:04.640 --> 2:36:05.640]  By the scruff of the neck
[2:36:05.640 --> 2:36:06.640]  Including a lot of the rich
[2:36:06.640 --> 2:36:08.640]  Who've got to do exactly what they say
[2:36:08.640 --> 2:36:11.640]  If you want any hope of ever having a recovery
[2:36:11.640 --> 2:36:13.640]  Which won't lead to a recovery
[2:36:13.640 --> 2:36:14.640]  It'll just be a stagnation
[2:36:14.640 --> 2:36:16.640]  And a new lower plateau
[2:36:16.640 --> 2:36:18.640]  Of standard of living
[2:36:18.640 --> 2:36:19.640]  Then do another plateau
[2:36:19.640 --> 2:36:22.640]  As they manage our slide downward
[2:36:22.640 --> 2:36:23.640]  In their own words
[2:36:23.640 --> 2:36:24.640]  Because we're too greedy
[2:36:24.640 --> 2:36:27.640]  And live too well
[2:36:27.640 --> 2:36:28.640]  I think that they would discuss
[2:36:28.640 --> 2:36:31.640]  The financial derivatives fiasco
[2:36:31.640 --> 2:36:32.640]  In the annual report
[2:36:32.640 --> 2:36:33.640]  But they didn't
[2:36:33.640 --> 2:36:35.640]  However, they did issue a statement
[2:36:35.640 --> 2:36:38.640]  On May 18th stating that
[2:36:38.640 --> 2:36:40.640]  Up until December of last year
[2:36:40.640 --> 2:36:44.640]  There were about 584 trillion
[2:36:44.640 --> 2:36:46.640]  Dollars worth of derivatives worldwide
[2:36:46.640 --> 2:36:49.640]  Which appears to be very small
[2:36:49.640 --> 2:36:51.640]  Considering it's about 1.4 quadrillion
[2:36:51.640 --> 2:36:53.640]  At least according to the figures
[2:36:53.640 --> 2:36:56.640]  Coming from the econometric
[2:36:56.640 --> 2:36:58.640]  Institutions here in the United States
[2:36:58.640 --> 2:36:59.640]  In Europe
[2:36:59.640 --> 2:37:02.640]  So it's a rather interesting discrepancy there
[2:37:02.640 --> 2:37:04.640]  But that's kind of like a black hole
[2:37:04.640 --> 2:37:06.640]  The size of the Milky Way
[2:37:06.640 --> 2:37:07.640]  Or a black hole
[2:37:07.640 --> 2:37:09.640]  The size of the solar system
[2:37:09.640 --> 2:37:10.640]  If it's right up on you
[2:37:10.640 --> 2:37:12.640]  It's going to gobble you up
[2:37:12.640 --> 2:37:13.640]  Or they may reappear
[2:37:13.640 --> 2:37:14.640]  Six months from now
[2:37:14.640 --> 2:37:16.640]  And more bailouts will be needed worldwide
[2:37:16.640 --> 2:37:18.640]  No, they're already saying that
[2:37:18.640 --> 2:37:20.640]  Do you have a question for Alan White?
[2:37:20.640 --> 2:37:21.640]  Yeah, I just wanted to mention
[2:37:21.640 --> 2:37:23.640]  Alan that what you said
[2:37:23.640 --> 2:37:25.640]  Is nothing new to me
[2:37:25.640 --> 2:37:29.640]  However, the model that Foucault talked about
[2:37:29.640 --> 2:37:32.640]  Using Jeremy Benton's metaphor
[2:37:32.640 --> 2:37:34.640]  The prison panopticon seems to be here
[2:37:34.640 --> 2:37:36.640]  With the technology
[2:37:36.640 --> 2:37:38.640]  And the sad thing is
[2:37:38.640 --> 2:37:41.640]  That many of these modalities were
[2:37:41.640 --> 2:37:43.640]  Discussed 60, 70 years ago
[2:37:43.640 --> 2:37:45.640]  I was thinking of Harold Blasswell's
[2:37:45.640 --> 2:37:48.640]  National Security State
[2:37:48.640 --> 2:37:50.640]  Concept and book that was
[2:37:50.640 --> 2:37:53.640]  Written in 1939 to 1940
[2:37:53.640 --> 2:37:55.640]  Really outlawed a complete
[2:37:55.640 --> 2:37:57.640]  Western sort of Soviet style
[2:37:57.640 --> 2:37:59.640]  Kind of national security state
[2:37:59.640 --> 2:38:01.640]  With violations of
[2:38:01.640 --> 2:38:03.640]  Accepted freedoms and constitutions
[2:38:03.640 --> 2:38:05.640]  And that's right, they used the threat
[2:38:05.640 --> 2:38:06.640]  To national security
[2:38:06.640 --> 2:38:08.640]  Then they built the shadow government
[2:38:08.640 --> 2:38:09.640]  Around that
[2:38:09.640 --> 2:38:11.640]  Now it's created this parallel government
[2:38:11.640 --> 2:38:13.640]  Now the parallel shadow government
[2:38:13.640 --> 2:38:14.640]  Is coming out in the open
[2:38:14.640 --> 2:38:17.640]  And absorbing what's left
[2:38:17.640 --> 2:38:19.640]  Kind of like putting an egg in vinegar
[2:38:19.640 --> 2:38:21.640]  They've been dissolving our shell
[2:38:21.640 --> 2:38:23.640]  Turning our skeleton into rubber
[2:38:23.640 --> 2:38:24.640]  So they can more easily
[2:38:24.640 --> 2:38:26.640]  Like a demonic pelican
[2:38:26.640 --> 2:38:28.640]  Force us into their maw
[2:38:28.640 --> 2:38:29.640]  Thank you for the call
[2:38:29.640 --> 2:38:31.640]  Let's get Alan Watts' comment on that
[2:38:31.640 --> 2:38:33.640]  Yeah, also too, there's another technique
[2:38:33.640 --> 2:38:34.640]  Involved
[2:38:34.640 --> 2:38:37.640]  Written back about 1914
[2:38:37.640 --> 2:38:39.640]  And H.G. Wells
[2:38:39.640 --> 2:38:41.640]  Who was an official propagandist
[2:38:41.640 --> 2:38:43.640]  For the People's Roads Foundation
[2:38:43.640 --> 2:38:44.640]  And the Fabian Society
[2:38:44.640 --> 2:38:46.640]  Two big players backed by the
[2:38:46.640 --> 2:38:48.640]  Aster family and their billions
[2:38:48.640 --> 2:38:50.640]  He called it the world brain
[2:38:50.640 --> 2:38:52.640]  He said eventually all information
[2:38:52.640 --> 2:38:55.640]  Will be controlled by a world brain
[2:38:55.640 --> 2:38:57.640]  And this information would develop
[2:38:57.640 --> 2:38:59.640]  A brand new world culture
[2:38:59.640 --> 2:39:01.640]  Which would be under the control, of course
[2:39:01.640 --> 2:39:03.640]  Of those physicists to rule it
[2:39:03.640 --> 2:39:06.640]  He's talking about supercomputers and so on
[2:39:06.640 --> 2:39:08.640]  And they were talking in the 20s
[2:39:08.640 --> 2:39:10.640]  About putting drugs and things in the water
[2:39:10.640 --> 2:39:13.640]  Specifically fluoride, diet, injections
[2:39:13.640 --> 2:39:16.640]  And injunctions to turn us into gibbering slaves
[2:39:16.640 --> 2:39:18.640]  And they've done an excellent job
[2:39:18.640 --> 2:39:21.640]  And Julian Huxley, the first CEO of UNESCO
[2:39:21.640 --> 2:39:24.640]  Also advised to use this technique
[2:39:24.640 --> 2:39:26.640]  But also according to
[2:39:26.640 --> 2:39:28.640]  Lord veteran Russell, another big player
[2:39:28.640 --> 2:39:31.640]  Who was also a member of MI5 and 6
[2:39:31.640 --> 2:39:34.640]  By the way, he said that
[2:39:34.640 --> 2:39:36.640]  They would also use the needle
[2:39:36.640 --> 2:39:38.640]  To make the people more compliant
[2:39:38.640 --> 2:39:40.640]  That's what he said in his own book
[2:39:40.640 --> 2:39:42.640]  The needle
[2:39:42.640 --> 2:39:43.640]  Yeah
[2:39:43.640 --> 2:39:45.640]  I had a Wall Street Journal writer
[2:39:45.640 --> 2:39:47.640]  Here the other day
[2:39:47.640 --> 2:39:49.640]  And
[2:39:49.640 --> 2:39:51.640]  She was definitely on the prowl
[2:39:51.640 --> 2:39:53.640]  I hope it's somewhat of a fair piece
[2:39:53.640 --> 2:39:55.640]  But I doubt it, but I'm not gonna
[2:39:55.640 --> 2:39:57.640]  Cal her from it
[2:39:57.640 --> 2:39:59.640]  Though I just may not have time
[2:39:59.640 --> 2:40:01.640]  For more stuff like that in the future
[2:40:01.640 --> 2:40:03.640]  And I explained to her
[2:40:03.640 --> 2:40:05.640]  I said, you know sodium fluoride causes brain damage
[2:40:05.640 --> 2:40:07.640]  And bone cancer, and I was printing her mainstream articles
[2:40:07.640 --> 2:40:09.640]  She goes, no, I know that, but she said
[2:40:09.640 --> 2:40:11.640]  The elite have to drink it too
[2:40:11.640 --> 2:40:13.640]  Like it was okay, and I said, well, if it's so bad
[2:40:13.640 --> 2:40:15.640]  Why do they do it?
[2:40:15.640 --> 2:40:17.640]  And like didn't compute
[2:40:17.640 --> 2:40:19.640]  She said, yeah, but they have to do it too
[2:40:19.640 --> 2:40:21.640]  And I said, no, they don't
[2:40:21.640 --> 2:40:23.640]  When Jay Rockefeller was here in town
[2:40:23.640 --> 2:40:25.640]  I did a radio show at a station
[2:40:25.640 --> 2:40:27.640]  Years ago, this was about 12 years ago
[2:40:27.640 --> 2:40:29.640]  And the other guy had a
[2:40:29.640 --> 2:40:31.640]  Well, he owned a marina
[2:40:31.640 --> 2:40:33.640]  Big marina, and he also
[2:40:33.640 --> 2:40:35.640]  Owned a bunch of boats you could charter
[2:40:35.640 --> 2:40:37.640]  Big, you know, I mean big for Lake Travis
[2:40:37.640 --> 2:40:39.640]  Yacht, so things of the whole like
[2:40:39.640 --> 2:40:41.640]  50, 60 people, really nice
[2:40:41.640 --> 2:40:43.640]  And he would take rich people out
[2:40:43.640 --> 2:40:45.640]  And captain it
[2:40:45.640 --> 2:40:47.640]  And take people out that wanted to scuba dive
[2:40:47.640 --> 2:40:49.640]  At the right time of the year in the rock bottom lake
[2:40:49.640 --> 2:40:51.640]  It's really a Colorado River canyon
[2:40:51.640 --> 2:40:53.640]  They filled, it's 37 mile long lake
[2:40:53.640 --> 2:40:55.640]  But long story short here
[2:40:55.640 --> 2:40:57.640]  For dreaming about being on the lake
[2:40:57.640 --> 2:40:59.640]  And then I'd go on the lake in two years, I'm so busy
[2:40:59.640 --> 2:41:01.640]  Literally, two years
[2:41:01.640 --> 2:41:03.640]  I love it, I think about it every day
[2:41:03.640 --> 2:41:05.640]  But the issue is Jay Rockefeller was down here
[2:41:05.640 --> 2:41:07.640]  For two days with the SOS people
[2:41:07.640 --> 2:41:09.640]  Surveying tens of thousands
[2:41:09.640 --> 2:41:11.640]  Of acres they'd stolen
[2:41:11.640 --> 2:41:13.640]  To watershed rules
[2:41:13.640 --> 2:41:15.640]  And he was
[2:41:15.640 --> 2:41:17.640]  Cappening the boat with some of the servants
[2:41:17.640 --> 2:41:19.640]  And people feeding them and all this stuff
[2:41:19.640 --> 2:41:21.640]  And
[2:41:21.640 --> 2:41:23.640]  He also did trips, people down to the Caribbean
[2:41:23.640 --> 2:41:25.640]  But that's a separate issue
[2:41:25.640 --> 2:41:27.640]  And he said, he sat there watching it
[2:41:27.640 --> 2:41:29.640]  And they had caviar
[2:41:29.640 --> 2:41:31.640]  And food for everybody, but Jay Rockefeller
[2:41:31.640 --> 2:41:33.640]  And a few of his assistants, they had ice chess
[2:41:33.640 --> 2:41:35.640]  With their own food, their own servants
[2:41:35.640 --> 2:41:37.640]  Their own wine, their own
[2:41:37.640 --> 2:41:39.640]  Bottled water
[2:41:39.640 --> 2:41:41.640]  And by the way, it was a certain brand of Arkansas water
[2:41:41.640 --> 2:41:43.640]  That I later saw one of my friends
[2:41:43.640 --> 2:41:45.640]  Was drinking, I found all the Hollywood folks drinking
[2:41:45.640 --> 2:41:47.640]  It's the same as that green bottled water
[2:41:47.640 --> 2:41:49.640]  I got around here sometimes
[2:41:49.640 --> 2:41:51.640]  The point is, he had that, a mountain valley
[2:41:51.640 --> 2:41:53.640]  A mountain valley, right?
[2:41:53.640 --> 2:41:55.640]  Mountain valley spring
[2:41:55.640 --> 2:41:57.640]  And he had all these little packaged
[2:41:57.640 --> 2:41:59.640]  In paper, it couldn't be plastic
[2:41:59.640 --> 2:42:01.640]  Salads and food, it was all about how
[2:42:01.640 --> 2:42:03.640]  It was all totally organic
[2:42:03.640 --> 2:42:05.640]  And all had been grown on farms
[2:42:05.640 --> 2:42:07.640]  His family owned
[2:42:07.640 --> 2:42:09.640]  And then I did a Google search years ago
[2:42:09.640 --> 2:42:11.640]  And found what you said
[2:42:11.640 --> 2:42:13.640]  And the same thing with Prince Philip
[2:42:13.640 --> 2:42:15.640]  I later saw him in a documentary about
[2:42:15.640 --> 2:42:17.640]  Winsor Palace
[2:42:17.640 --> 2:42:19.640]  He has all his own fields, all his own beef
[2:42:19.640 --> 2:42:21.640]  It was him on TV, on PBS
[2:42:21.640 --> 2:42:23.640]  Inspecting it and inspecting the grain
[2:42:23.640 --> 2:42:25.640]  And making sure nothing GMO
[2:42:25.640 --> 2:42:27.640]  Was fed behind this walled city
[2:42:27.640 --> 2:42:29.640]  And how they have the meat and food
[2:42:29.640 --> 2:42:31.640]  Flown around with him
[2:42:31.640 --> 2:42:33.640]  Go ahead
[2:42:33.640 --> 2:42:35.640]  Yes, and it does not take on a British newspaper
[2:42:35.640 --> 2:42:37.640]  Prince Charles, too, had over
[2:42:37.640 --> 2:42:39.640]  I think 80 to 100 farms
[2:42:39.640 --> 2:42:41.640]  And farmers worked on them
[2:42:41.640 --> 2:42:43.640]  Again, massive herds of Angus
[2:42:43.640 --> 2:42:45.640]  And beef
[2:42:45.640 --> 2:42:47.640]  Lots of
[2:42:47.640 --> 2:42:49.640]  Thousands and thousands of acres
[2:42:49.640 --> 2:42:51.640]  Naturally grown corn, etc
[2:42:51.640 --> 2:42:53.640]  Everything that you need
[2:42:53.640 --> 2:42:55.640]  They do not need
[2:42:55.640 --> 2:42:57.640]  They don't eat what we eat
[2:42:57.640 --> 2:42:59.640]  Plus, he's another thing, too
[2:42:59.640 --> 2:43:01.640]  Most people don't realize that these very important people
[2:43:01.640 --> 2:43:03.640]  Already believe
[2:43:03.640 --> 2:43:05.640]  That we
[2:43:05.640 --> 2:43:07.640]  Are so contaminated with different diseases
[2:43:07.640 --> 2:43:09.640]  That they
[2:43:09.640 --> 2:43:11.640]  And this was in the newspaper
[2:43:11.640 --> 2:43:13.640]  In Canada about two or three years ago
[2:43:13.640 --> 2:43:15.640]  It came out when the prime minister
[2:43:15.640 --> 2:43:17.640]  In Canada was going abroad
[2:43:17.640 --> 2:43:19.640]  All prime ministers and high level bureaucrats
[2:43:19.640 --> 2:43:21.640]  And important people
[2:43:21.640 --> 2:43:23.640]  Carry at least two pints
[2:43:23.640 --> 2:43:25.640]  Of their own blood, refrigerated blood
[2:43:25.640 --> 2:43:27.640]  With them wherever they go
[2:43:27.640 --> 2:43:29.640]  That was in USA Today
[2:43:29.640 --> 2:43:31.640]  Al Gore has a whole refrigerator
[2:43:31.640 --> 2:43:33.640]  Of blood that follows him
[2:43:33.640 --> 2:43:35.640]  That's right, because they believe
[2:43:35.640 --> 2:43:37.640]  They've already been successful
[2:43:37.640 --> 2:43:39.640]  In infecting us all with different kinds of things
[2:43:39.640 --> 2:43:41.640]  They will not risk getting a transfusion
[2:43:41.640 --> 2:43:43.640]  From us
[2:43:43.640 --> 2:43:45.640]  And the standard procedure has been
[2:43:45.640 --> 2:43:47.640]  For the last 15 years
[2:43:47.640 --> 2:43:49.640]  Well, that ties into Bayer
[2:43:49.640 --> 2:43:51.640]  Knowingly for over a decade
[2:43:51.640 --> 2:43:53.640]  Over a million doses, just in one case
[2:43:53.640 --> 2:43:55.640]  Of factor 8, knowing it all had HIV
[2:43:55.640 --> 2:43:57.640]  And hepatitis, and their own documents came out
[2:43:57.640 --> 2:43:59.640]  Even MSNBC reported it like it was no big deal
[2:43:59.640 --> 2:44:01.640]  Knowing they were going to kill everybody
[2:44:01.640 --> 2:44:03.640]  And they said, oh, well, Bayer was just greedy
[2:44:03.640 --> 2:44:05.640]  He didn't care, no, this was a religious sacrament
[2:44:05.640 --> 2:44:07.640]  This was a murder operation
[2:44:07.640 --> 2:44:09.640]  Lovingly carried out
[2:44:09.640 --> 2:44:11.640]  Yes, that's right
[2:44:11.640 --> 2:44:13.640]  And so the public have no idea
[2:44:13.640 --> 2:44:15.640]  How far ahead these characters are
[2:44:15.640 --> 2:44:17.640]  I've even been asked about the spring
[2:44:17.640 --> 2:44:19.640]  And how can these guys be breathing the same air
[2:44:19.640 --> 2:44:21.640]  As we, well, most of the time
[2:44:21.640 --> 2:44:23.640]  These guys are in their air conditioned
[2:44:23.640 --> 2:44:25.640]  Filtered limos, or in their air conditioned
[2:44:25.640 --> 2:44:27.640]  Filtered homes
[2:44:27.640 --> 2:44:29.640]  Also, and someone sent me this thing
[2:44:29.640 --> 2:44:31.640]  That there's actually a collation device
[2:44:31.640 --> 2:44:33.640]  That goes in your vein
[2:44:33.640 --> 2:44:35.640]  And it's portable, and you can strap it to your arm
[2:44:35.640 --> 2:44:37.640]  No one knows you're even wearing it
[2:44:37.640 --> 2:44:39.640]  And apparently it's just as effective
[2:44:39.640 --> 2:44:41.640]  As the renal kidney dialysis machines
[2:44:41.640 --> 2:44:43.640]  They can be said to take it
[2:44:43.640 --> 2:44:45.640]  Any kind of toxin
[2:44:45.640 --> 2:44:47.640]  But it's so expensive, the public won't get it
[2:44:47.640 --> 2:44:49.640]  Well, I want to add, there's certain areas
[2:44:49.640 --> 2:44:51.640]  They don't spray like whitefishing
[2:44:51.640 --> 2:44:53.640]  Areas where they stay most of the year now
[2:44:53.640 --> 2:44:55.640]  Where they're not chemtrailing
[2:44:55.640 --> 2:44:57.640]  So I wanted to bring that up
[2:44:57.640 --> 2:44:59.640]  They have admitted they've been chemtrailing
[2:44:59.640 --> 2:45:01.640]  Since the mid-90s
[2:45:01.640 --> 2:45:03.640]  They got a Nobel Prize in 92 for it
[2:45:03.640 --> 2:45:05.640]  I'm making a separate film on that
[2:45:05.640 --> 2:45:07.640]  And
[2:45:07.640 --> 2:45:09.640]  We always said it's barium, salts, it's
[2:45:09.640 --> 2:45:11.640]  Luminum dioxide, it's terraforming
[2:45:11.640 --> 2:45:13.640]  But also toxic, they love multifaceted things
[2:45:13.640 --> 2:45:15.640]  That cover multiple bases
[2:45:15.640 --> 2:45:17.640]  They love grand slams
[2:45:17.640 --> 2:45:19.640]  Where they get to carry out multiple evils
[2:45:19.640 --> 2:45:21.640]  At the same time and consolidate power
[2:45:21.640 --> 2:45:23.640]  And now they've just come out
[2:45:23.640 --> 2:45:25.640]  With an associated press and Reuters
[2:45:25.640 --> 2:45:27.640]  And here it is, Wall Street
[2:45:27.640 --> 2:45:29.640]  Wall Street Journal two weeks ago
[2:45:29.640 --> 2:45:31.640]  It's time to cool the planet
[2:45:31.640 --> 2:45:33.640]  With chemtrailing terraforming
[2:45:33.640 --> 2:45:35.640]  And the ingredients they list is exactly what
[2:45:35.640 --> 2:45:37.640]  Private scientists studied it and said it was
[2:45:37.640 --> 2:45:39.640]  And then they go, oh yes, that was all just
[2:45:39.640 --> 2:45:41.640]  Testing
[2:45:41.640 --> 2:45:43.640]  Now we're going to start the real operation
[2:45:43.640 --> 2:45:45.640]  The earth's 20% darker
[2:45:45.640 --> 2:45:47.640]  And all the climatologists I interviewed
[2:45:47.640 --> 2:45:49.640]  Say
[2:45:49.640 --> 2:45:51.640]  That looking at what they're spraying
[2:45:51.640 --> 2:45:53.640]  Is actually heating the earth
[2:45:53.640 --> 2:45:55.640]  So are they trying to cause more
[2:45:55.640 --> 2:45:57.640]  I mean we know they have weather weapons
[2:45:57.640 --> 2:45:59.640]  I broke the father of weather weapons
[2:45:59.640 --> 2:46:01.640]  Ben Livingston here on air
[2:46:01.640 --> 2:46:03.640]  What they were doing with it 50 years ago
[2:46:03.640 --> 2:46:05.640]  They could control hurricanes in the late 60s
[2:46:05.640 --> 2:46:07.640]  Stanford Research Institute certified
[2:46:07.640 --> 2:46:09.640]  But are they planning to engineer bigger calamities
[2:46:09.640 --> 2:46:11.640]  And droughts and then say, oh see
[2:46:11.640 --> 2:46:13.640]  We've got to save you
[2:46:13.640 --> 2:46:15.640]  But then cover it saying they're trying to fix it
[2:46:15.640 --> 2:46:17.640]  Because we've exposed the chemtrails
[2:46:17.640 --> 2:46:19.640]  Now they've got to admit it, go ahead
[2:46:19.640 --> 2:46:21.640]  70s, I think 78
[2:46:21.640 --> 2:46:23.640]  All the major countries
[2:46:23.640 --> 2:46:25.640]  The United States, Britain
[2:46:25.640 --> 2:46:27.640]  Canada and so on, all signed an
[2:46:27.640 --> 2:46:29.640]  International agreement, a treaty
[2:46:29.640 --> 2:46:31.640]  At the United Nations on weather warfare
[2:46:31.640 --> 2:46:33.640]  And people can go into it and check it out
[2:46:33.640 --> 2:46:35.640]  For themselves
[2:46:35.640 --> 2:46:37.640]  In there it tells you what they could do then
[2:46:37.640 --> 2:46:39.640]  They could create earthquakes, droughts, floods
[2:46:39.640 --> 2:46:41.640]  Famines and so on
[2:46:41.640 --> 2:46:43.640]  All just with the heart technology
[2:46:43.640 --> 2:46:45.640]  And the spraying alone in conjunction
[2:46:45.640 --> 2:46:47.640]  And Secretary of Defense Cohen
[2:46:47.640 --> 2:46:49.640]  1997
[2:46:49.640 --> 2:46:51.640]  April 27th
[2:46:51.640 --> 2:46:53.640]  Issue of Army Times
[2:46:53.640 --> 2:46:55.640]  Said the exact same thing, in fact
[2:46:55.640 --> 2:46:57.640]  People don't believe it, type Secretary of Defense
[2:46:57.640 --> 2:46:59.640]  William Cohen
[2:46:59.640 --> 2:47:01.640]  Army Times
[2:47:01.640 --> 2:47:03.640]  Weather Weapons
[2:47:03.640 --> 2:47:05.640]  Or Secretary of Defense William Cohen
[2:47:05.640 --> 2:47:07.640]  Army Times Earthquakes
[2:47:07.640 --> 2:47:09.640]  That'll pull it up too, go ahead Alan
[2:47:09.640 --> 2:47:11.640]  And so what they can do is so simply now
[2:47:11.640 --> 2:47:13.640]  Because there's all technologies well tried
[2:47:13.640 --> 2:47:15.640]  And tested, and they have given drugs
[2:47:15.640 --> 2:47:17.640]  In different areas, they put lots of
[2:47:17.640 --> 2:47:19.640]  Farmers out in Canada and the states
[2:47:19.640 --> 2:47:21.640]  Either with droughts or floods
[2:47:21.640 --> 2:47:23.640]  All at the same time, we always had the same
[2:47:23.640 --> 2:47:25.640]  Flood in the bread basket in Canada
[2:47:25.640 --> 2:47:27.640]  As you were having in the bread basket in the U.S.
[2:47:27.640 --> 2:47:29.640]  And we were getting droughts at the same time
[2:47:29.640 --> 2:47:31.640]  So this was coordinated to bring down the food supply
[2:47:31.640 --> 2:47:33.640]  But they will convince the public
[2:47:33.640 --> 2:47:35.640]  With odd acts of
[2:47:35.640 --> 2:47:37.640]  Weather warfare that we are
[2:47:37.640 --> 2:47:39.640]  As nature rebelling
[2:47:39.640 --> 2:47:41.640]  That's what they'll tell us all
[2:47:41.640 --> 2:47:43.640]  They can stand there and whistle in the wind
[2:47:43.640 --> 2:47:45.640]  But nothing to do with it because
[2:47:45.640 --> 2:47:47.640]  Because they'll never admit they're actually using it
[2:47:47.640 --> 2:47:49.640]  To terrify the public
[2:47:49.640 --> 2:47:51.640]  And then the public will be more
[2:47:51.640 --> 2:47:53.640]  Compliant and give up even more
[2:47:53.640 --> 2:47:55.640]  Rights and allow themselves to be guided
[2:47:55.640 --> 2:47:57.640]  Well it's just like the New World Order
[2:47:57.640 --> 2:47:59.640]  All these decades we had their documents
[2:47:59.640 --> 2:48:01.640]  Their statements, their videos, their books
[2:48:01.640 --> 2:48:03.640]  We go look, they're seeing it, and the public would say
[2:48:03.640 --> 2:48:05.640]  That's fake video of David Rockefeller
[2:48:05.640 --> 2:48:07.640]  The Rothschild family doesn't exist
[2:48:07.640 --> 2:48:09.640]  I remember hearing that 15 years ago
[2:48:09.640 --> 2:48:11.640]  That they didn't exist
[2:48:11.640 --> 2:48:13.640]  That the CFR didn't exist
[2:48:13.640 --> 2:48:15.640]  Now they say, oh it exists
[2:48:15.640 --> 2:48:17.640]  We need a world government
[2:48:17.640 --> 2:48:19.640]  To keep us safe
[2:48:21.640 --> 2:48:23.640]  And it's the same thing now
[2:48:23.640 --> 2:48:25.640]  There's no chemtrails, they're not manipulating the weather
[2:48:25.640 --> 2:48:27.640]  Trails have always hung there for hours
[2:48:27.640 --> 2:48:29.640]  At 2,000 feet
[2:48:29.640 --> 2:48:31.640]  No, and then now they go
[2:48:31.640 --> 2:48:33.640]  Oh we're spraying you, yeah it's good
[2:48:33.640 --> 2:48:35.640]  Yeah
[2:48:35.640 --> 2:48:37.640]  And to say it true, they tell us
[2:48:37.640 --> 2:48:39.640]  That it could have drastic consequences
[2:48:39.640 --> 2:48:41.640]  If they were to go ahead and spray
[2:48:41.640 --> 2:48:43.640]  Meaning on human health
[2:48:43.640 --> 2:48:45.640]  That's why when they started at 9 to 8
[2:48:45.640 --> 2:48:47.640]  They couldn't tell the public what they were doing
[2:48:47.640 --> 2:48:49.640]  They already know the catastrophic effects
[2:48:49.640 --> 2:48:51.640]  It's had on people's health with asthma
[2:48:51.640 --> 2:48:53.640]  People at 40, 50 get diagnosed with asthma
[2:48:53.640 --> 2:48:55.640]  People dying of bronchial diseases
[2:48:55.640 --> 2:48:57.640]  They can't get rid of the cough
[2:48:57.640 --> 2:48:59.640]  They understand
[2:48:59.640 --> 2:49:01.640]  They have the pulse on the people all the time
[2:49:01.640 --> 2:49:03.640]  They have all the data coming in
[2:49:03.640 --> 2:49:05.640]  From hospitals all the time
[2:49:05.640 --> 2:49:07.640]  Daily and they know the effects
[2:49:07.640 --> 2:49:09.640]  That they've been having
[2:49:09.640 --> 2:49:11.640]  And what it's doing to the people
[2:49:11.640 --> 2:49:13.640]  Yeah, here is
[2:49:13.640 --> 2:49:15.640]  fas.orgnews.usa
[2:49:15.640 --> 2:49:17.640]  You can also go to the army website
[2:49:17.640 --> 2:49:19.640]  And here he is
[2:49:19.640 --> 2:49:21.640]  You guys just had it on screen with the control F
[2:49:21.640 --> 2:49:23.640]  You can read it right there
[2:49:23.640 --> 2:49:25.640]  We talked about
[2:49:25.640 --> 2:49:27.640]  He says
[2:49:27.640 --> 2:49:29.640]  He quotes Alvin and Heidi Toffler
[2:49:29.640 --> 2:49:31.640]  Has written about this in terms of some scientists
[2:49:31.640 --> 2:49:33.640]  In their laboratories
[2:49:33.640 --> 2:49:35.640]  Trying to buy certain types of pathogens
[2:49:35.640 --> 2:49:37.640]  To be ethnic specific
[2:49:37.640 --> 2:49:39.640]  So they would just eliminate certain ethnic groups and races
[2:49:39.640 --> 2:49:41.640]  And others are designing
[2:49:41.640 --> 2:49:43.640]  Some sort of engineering
[2:49:43.640 --> 2:49:45.640]  Some sort of insects that can destroy specific crops
[2:49:45.640 --> 2:49:47.640]  Others are engaging even in an eco type of terrorism
[2:49:47.640 --> 2:49:49.640]  Whereby they can alter the climate
[2:49:49.640 --> 2:49:51.640]  Shut off earthquakes, volcanoes remotely
[2:49:51.640 --> 2:49:53.640]  To the use of electromagnetic waves
[2:49:53.640 --> 2:49:55.640]  That's the army times
[2:49:55.640 --> 2:49:57.640]  In April of
[2:49:57.640 --> 2:49:59.640]  1997
[2:49:59.640 --> 2:50:01.640]  You can go to the top and show folks
[2:50:01.640 --> 2:50:03.640]  But the issue here is
[2:50:03.640 --> 2:50:05.640]  That
[2:50:05.640 --> 2:50:07.640]  Now in September
[2:50:07.640 --> 2:50:09.640]  2000, rebuilding America's defenses
[2:50:09.640 --> 2:50:11.640]  Written by Dick Cheney, he says
[2:50:11.640 --> 2:50:13.640]  We need to prepare the public with the media
[2:50:13.640 --> 2:50:15.640]  To accept race specific
[2:50:15.640 --> 2:50:17.640]  Bio
[2:50:17.640 --> 2:50:19.640]  Weapons
[2:50:19.640 --> 2:50:21.640]  And that it's good
[2:50:21.640 --> 2:50:23.640]  And even the Austin America statesman
[2:50:23.640 --> 2:50:25.640]  Wrote an article saying, you know, is Dick Cheney right?
[2:50:25.640 --> 2:50:27.640]  Should we kill certain races?
[2:50:27.640 --> 2:50:29.640]  So if you call somebody a racial term
[2:50:29.640 --> 2:50:31.640]  The media cries, you get arrested
[2:50:31.640 --> 2:50:33.640]  We love you so much black people
[2:50:33.640 --> 2:50:35.640]  But then it's like
[2:50:35.640 --> 2:50:37.640]  Should we kill all the blacks?
[2:50:37.640 --> 2:50:39.640]  You know, it's loving
[2:50:39.640 --> 2:50:41.640]  Oprah's at the meeting
[2:50:41.640 --> 2:50:43.640]  I mean
[2:50:43.640 --> 2:50:45.640]  So it's like, oh, I'm a liberal
[2:50:45.640 --> 2:50:47.640]  I'm Margaret Sanger
[2:50:47.640 --> 2:50:49.640]  You're subhuman, I only want to kill you
[2:50:49.640 --> 2:50:51.640]  For the earth
[2:50:51.640 --> 2:50:53.640]  You know I love you, I'm sorry we have to kill you
[2:50:53.640 --> 2:50:55.640]  Don't be racist
[2:50:55.640 --> 2:50:57.640]  Again, if you're against the world order
[2:50:57.640 --> 2:50:59.640]  You're racist, you're against killing everyone
[2:50:59.640 --> 2:51:01.640]  You're racist
[2:51:01.640 --> 2:51:03.640]  You've probably heard about the incredible
[2:51:03.640 --> 2:51:05.640]  Powerful and natural antioxidants
[2:51:05.640 --> 2:51:07.640]  Found in red wine
[2:51:07.640 --> 2:51:09.640]  Unfortunately, not everyone is able to
[2:51:09.640 --> 2:51:11.640]  Drink a glass of wine each day
[2:51:11.640 --> 2:51:13.640]  Now, you don't have to drink even a single drop
[2:51:13.640 --> 2:51:15.640]  Thanks to New Rev

[2:53:46.640 --> 2:53:49.640]  And save you thousands of dollars today
[2:53:49.640 --> 2:53:52.640]  That number again is free and in 10 minutes
[2:53:52.640 --> 2:53:55.640]  They will show you how much you can save
[2:53:55.640 --> 2:54:01.180]  4338-888-213-4338 and help us win this battle.
[2:54:01.180 --> 2:54:25.820]  Alan Watts our guest, I want to blitz through some news that is coming up, but let's go
[2:54:25.820 --> 2:54:26.820]  back to your phone calls.
[2:54:26.820 --> 2:54:28.900]  He's going to be with us into the next hour.
[2:54:28.900 --> 2:54:35.900]  His website is CuttingToTheMatrix.com, our sites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.tv.
[2:54:35.900 --> 2:54:39.380]  Alright I'm going to try to move quickly now, I had one caller on for like 5 minutes.
[2:54:39.380 --> 2:54:42.340]  Mark in Oregon, you're on the air, go ahead.
[2:54:42.340 --> 2:54:44.940]  Hello gentlemen.
[2:54:44.940 --> 2:54:45.940]  Go ahead Mark.
[2:54:45.940 --> 2:54:48.780]  Yeah Halle, how are you doing Halle?
[2:54:48.780 --> 2:54:49.780]  Fine.
[2:54:49.780 --> 2:54:50.780]  What's on your mind?
[2:54:50.780 --> 2:54:56.780]  Alex, I notice you're both, and I'm not being destructively critical here, but I'm being
[2:54:56.780 --> 2:55:02.860]  constructively critical because the hour is getting extremely late here, okay?
[2:55:02.860 --> 2:55:08.620]  And if you don't realize that fully then you'll continue on making movies and trying to write
[2:55:08.620 --> 2:55:14.500]  a book and they will have us down to about 2 months now from as we speak to get us all
[2:55:14.500 --> 2:55:16.500]  sick and die.
[2:55:16.500 --> 2:55:17.500]  And you're really...
[2:55:17.500 --> 2:55:22.700]  No listen, this is an increment, hold on a minute, I think you called a few months ago
[2:55:22.700 --> 2:55:24.660]  saying evacuate over the flu.
[2:55:24.660 --> 2:55:28.620]  This is all drills and they incrementally ratchet things up.
[2:55:28.620 --> 2:55:31.220]  I don't think everything's going to collapse in 2 months, but go ahead.
[2:55:31.220 --> 2:55:35.580]  I like to think that you're right Alex and I hope that you are, but I don't think we
[2:55:35.580 --> 2:55:39.740]  can even begin to assume that when we've got a much worse one coming along according to
[2:55:39.740 --> 2:55:43.180]  Jenna Napolitano in about 2 months.
[2:55:43.180 --> 2:55:44.180]  Alex...
[2:55:44.180 --> 2:55:46.020]  Well I hope you're wrong.
[2:55:46.020 --> 2:55:49.060]  I hope you're wrong, but yes they are acting like they're going to drop something big in
[2:55:49.060 --> 2:55:53.660]  the next 2-3 months and all I can do is do the best job I can.
[2:55:53.660 --> 2:55:58.460]  I don't have all the answers and I sure would like to run off to the Caribbean with my family,
[2:55:58.460 --> 2:56:01.900]  but I'm not doing that and so I don't really know what the...
[2:56:01.900 --> 2:56:05.500]  I mean, I understand your question though, you're saying, well I mean finish your statement
[2:56:05.500 --> 2:56:07.580]  and I'm going to get Alan Watts' take on it.
[2:56:07.580 --> 2:56:08.580]  Okay.
[2:56:08.580 --> 2:56:16.300]  Well Alex, the point of my call is that it's been long on knowledge and solutions to expose
[2:56:16.300 --> 2:56:17.300]  the evil.
[2:56:17.300 --> 2:56:19.220]  That has not slowed it down one bit.
[2:56:19.220 --> 2:56:23.140]  I've been watching it since 1978 when I learned of the Illuminati.
[2:56:23.140 --> 2:56:24.860]  I've been studying their moves.
[2:56:24.860 --> 2:56:29.620]  I've seen the progress that they have made in the implementation of their plan to kill
[2:56:29.620 --> 2:56:35.300]  us all and that plan is coming up very soon to its end of the end game point.
[2:56:35.300 --> 2:56:39.420]  You can go out to the world, Alan Watts can go out into the world, Dr. Stan Monteith can
[2:56:39.420 --> 2:56:44.260]  go out to the world, so can Pastor Butch Paul and several other people get together and
[2:56:44.260 --> 2:56:48.900]  go out into the world and give global speaking tours, get some publicity, get some power of
[2:56:48.900 --> 2:56:53.180]  attention going in the people of the world and let's get going somewhere, Alex, because
[2:56:53.180 --> 2:56:55.780]  the way we're going, they're killing us and I love you, Dr. Butch.
[2:56:55.780 --> 2:56:58.020]  Well, listen, I hear you and I appreciate your call.
[2:56:58.020 --> 2:57:01.860]  Everybody gets frustrated by this and thinks I've got the answer to save people.
[2:57:01.860 --> 2:57:07.580]  I don't have the money to go travel around the world and then to advertise to get crowds
[2:57:07.580 --> 2:57:09.860]  there and then the media just ignores us.
[2:57:09.860 --> 2:57:14.300]  But I can sit here while the web's still open and reach millions of people every couple
[2:57:14.300 --> 2:57:18.420]  of days now, maybe even every day, it's really getting big, it's kind of scary to have this
[2:57:18.420 --> 2:57:19.420]  responsibility.
[2:57:19.420 --> 2:57:23.020]  I'm just doing what I can do as best I can.
[2:57:23.020 --> 2:57:25.860]  The answer is all of you going out and speaking out.
[2:57:25.860 --> 2:57:26.860]  Alan?
[2:57:26.860 --> 2:57:33.940]  It's true and I understand where he's coming from because you see these people, these organizations
[2:57:33.940 --> 2:57:39.220]  have been at war with the world for hundreds of years and openly so for the last hundred
[2:57:39.220 --> 2:57:45.500]  years in their own publications and of course they have used this time to try and close
[2:57:45.500 --> 2:57:52.380]  every possible loophole to stop people stating themselves, if you like, to understand their
[2:57:52.380 --> 2:57:53.380]  frustration.
[2:57:53.380 --> 2:57:59.740]  But all we can truly do is to get people to individually become active and if nothing
[2:57:59.740 --> 2:58:05.940]  else planned for themselves and their families, etc., various contingency plans to try and
[2:58:05.940 --> 2:58:06.940]  save themselves.
[2:58:06.940 --> 2:58:08.140]  I understand this.
[2:58:08.140 --> 2:58:12.940]  The whole world is in on this together and it doesn't matter, I think, where you run
[2:58:12.940 --> 2:58:17.780]  off to today personally, I think it's going to be implemented across the planet at the
[2:58:17.780 --> 2:58:18.780]  same time.
[2:58:18.780 --> 2:58:22.540]  So, where we like it or not, we're here in the middle of it, we've got to fight it
[2:58:22.540 --> 2:58:25.820]  right from here as best we can, as best we can.
[2:58:25.820 --> 2:58:29.100]  All we have at the moment is speech, that's all we have.
[2:58:29.100 --> 2:58:33.300]  And they are passing bills to eliminate that and when they say it's illegal to speak out,
[2:58:33.300 --> 2:58:36.620]  we've got to say no, you're the criminal, we're standing up against you.
[2:58:36.620 --> 2:58:42.820]  Back in 70 Seconds with Alan Watt in the final hour.
[2:58:42.820 --> 2:58:51.260]  Thank you for listening to GCN, visit GCNLive.com today.
[2:58:51.260 --> 2:58:52.820]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[2:58:52.820 --> 2:58:56.660]  I've told you for a long time it's important to be self-sufficient and today that's more
[2:58:56.660 --> 2:58:57.660]  important than ever.
[2:58:57.660 --> 2:59:00.420]  We need to be independent and food and water is the key.
[2:59:00.420 --> 2:59:03.420]  You'll never have to stand in a bread line until you have your own bread.
[2:59:03.420 --> 2:59:07.460]  You'll never have to go to the Superdome and beg for FEMA to take care of your family.
[2:59:07.460 --> 2:59:11.380]  In any emergency, if you simply prepare, no one is going to take care of your family in
[2:59:11.380 --> 2:59:13.020]  the final equation with you.
[2:59:13.020 --> 2:59:17.340]  You know, eFoodsDirect.com is still able to shift horrible food that's safe from E. coli,
[2:59:17.340 --> 2:59:21.060]  salmonella, genetic alteration, or Chinese imports and they do it at almost half the
[2:59:21.060 --> 2:59:23.300]  cost of last year's grocery prices.
[2:59:23.300 --> 2:59:28.620]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or on the web, go to eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:59:28.620 --> 2:59:33.300]  Visit eFoodsDirect.com and look over the fine list of high quality, freeze dried, and dehydrated
[2:59:33.300 --> 2:59:34.780]  foods they have to offer.
[2:59:34.780 --> 2:59:41.180]  Watch the free videos, look at their online catalog or give them a call at 1-800-409-5633.
[2:59:41.180 --> 2:59:46.140]  Or on the web at eFoodsDirect.com.
[2:59:46.140 --> 2:59:47.140]  Take action today.
[2:59:47.140 --> 3:00:17.100]  The first step is getting storeable food.
[3:00:17.100 --> 3:00:21.940]  A lot of people then kind of get the catatonic state and don't fight it because they imagine
[3:00:21.940 --> 3:00:26.460]  instant gratification, instant victory against the corruption, or they think it's futile.
[3:00:26.460 --> 3:00:30.140]  The truth is they wouldn't be trying to shut down our free speech if they were already
[3:00:30.140 --> 3:00:31.140]  all powerful.
[3:00:31.140 --> 3:00:35.220]  They are not invincible and there's a huge awakening taking place and we've got to believe
[3:00:35.220 --> 3:00:38.660]  in ourselves enough to be able to defeat this thing.
[3:00:38.660 --> 3:00:41.140]  I know one thing, standing up is not futile.
[3:00:41.140 --> 3:00:44.100]  Alan Wadar, guest of the bottom of the hour, really appreciate all the time he's given
[3:00:44.100 --> 3:00:45.100]  us today.
[3:00:45.100 --> 3:00:50.380]  Dave in California, then Debra, Steve, Gary, and others, Dave, you're on the air, welcome.
[3:00:50.380 --> 3:00:57.540]  Another great show as usual, and hello Alan, I'll make it really fast guys, since we're
[3:00:57.540 --> 3:01:02.740]  talking about eugenics, I once heard a wise man say, judge a society by how it treats
[3:01:02.740 --> 3:01:09.260]  its most vulnerable members, and regarding that, in California alone, 400,000 independent
[3:01:09.260 --> 3:01:13.780]  productive people with limited disabilities who only need a little assistance in their
[3:01:13.780 --> 3:01:19.260]  own homes to safely prepare meals, take their medications, do heavy chores, etc., are being
[3:01:19.260 --> 3:01:22.020]  totally cut out of Schwarzenegger's budget.
[3:01:22.020 --> 3:01:26.820]  This means that most of them will have to be warehoused and convalescent, privatized
[3:01:26.820 --> 3:01:31.700]  FEMA camps, basically, that cost three times more, where they have no rights at all.
[3:01:31.700 --> 3:01:32.700]  We're still...
[3:01:32.700 --> 3:01:34.380]  But see, that's the profit, that's the profit.
[3:01:34.380 --> 3:01:38.340]  There's plenty of money to institutionalize you, plenty of money to get you in the system
[3:01:38.340 --> 3:01:42.140]  and euthanize you, which they're already doing nationwide, Wall Street Journal admits.
[3:01:42.140 --> 3:01:47.140]  There's plenty of money for all of that, there's just not money for you to be self-sufficient.
[3:01:47.140 --> 3:01:48.140]  Go ahead, sorry.
[3:01:48.140 --> 3:01:49.140]  Right.
[3:01:49.140 --> 3:01:50.140]  We're still...
[3:01:50.140 --> 3:01:54.300]  There's only 30,000 convalescent beds available in the state, so I guess they all just get
[3:01:54.300 --> 3:01:55.300]  to die.
[3:01:55.300 --> 3:02:01.060]  I see this as Schwarzenegger making his eugenicist bones in California so he can run for president
[3:02:01.060 --> 3:02:03.660]  in 2012, when you guys think about that.
[3:02:03.660 --> 3:02:06.820]  I agree, go ahead.
[3:02:06.820 --> 3:02:12.300]  I think that's probably the way it is too, there's no doubt about it, but we got to understand
[3:02:12.300 --> 3:02:16.340]  when these guys talk about useless eaters, and that's what Russell and others have called
[3:02:16.340 --> 3:02:22.020]  people who are not completely physically or mentally healthy, that's the standard eugenicist
[3:02:22.020 --> 3:02:28.700]  talk, then they want to eradicate them, and you'll notice in that big, supposedly open
[3:02:28.700 --> 3:02:36.060]  to the public conference they had that Obama set out on the comparative effectiveness council
[3:02:36.060 --> 3:02:40.820]  to do with health care, they're going to slash back on all types of health care and find
[3:02:40.820 --> 3:02:45.180]  alternative effective means, that's what they say.
[3:02:45.180 --> 3:02:51.820]  And I even put a video up of Obama's appointee walking off when he was challenged by executive
[3:02:51.820 --> 3:02:57.780]  challenge review about being a eugenicist himself and wanting to bring down the population.
[3:02:57.780 --> 3:03:01.660]  He was on the panel, he walked off in the video.
[3:03:01.660 --> 3:03:08.580]  The Anton Shaken, Tarpley's former partner in authoring books, brought up the real stuff,
[3:03:08.580 --> 3:03:13.180]  and for those that don't believe this, even Bloomberg reported it, in the book written
[3:03:13.180 --> 3:03:17.140]  by Dashel, he was going to be the head of health care, he says, yes, if you're an old
[3:03:17.140 --> 3:03:22.180]  person you don't get the same access a young person does, you're not as valuable, this
[3:03:22.180 --> 3:03:29.500]  isn't some right wing thing attacking socialized health care, this is a fact, this is socialized
[3:03:29.500 --> 3:03:33.860]  health care is an aspirin for a heart attack, Obama is in there, and I appreciate your call
[3:03:33.860 --> 3:03:38.620]  sir, pushing it right now, why don't you explain to folks what universal health care means,
[3:03:38.620 --> 3:03:41.740]  it means universal eugenics death care.
[3:03:41.740 --> 3:03:46.140]  It does, if you understand that Britain was one of the first countries in Canada to bring
[3:03:46.140 --> 3:03:51.860]  up socialized health care, Thompson was the guy who brought up, Canada is up on Wikipedia
[3:03:51.860 --> 3:03:57.580]  right now because he's a top eugenist, he's too toped openly about coming off the unfit
[3:03:57.580 --> 3:04:03.540]  and firm and useless eaters, he brought health care into Canada, socialized medicine, where
[3:04:03.540 --> 3:04:09.660]  I live here you can't get a doctor, you cannot get one, and what they describe in Canada
[3:04:09.660 --> 3:04:15.180]  for pretty well all problems are simply painkillers, just go home, you don't feel the pain, the
[3:04:15.180 --> 3:04:19.460]  disease can progress and get worse and you'll die, that's basically what it is, it's cost
[3:04:19.460 --> 3:04:24.620]  effectiveness because socialized medicine comes under a government policy, government
[3:04:24.620 --> 3:04:29.540]  policy is the key and it's also to do with economics.
[3:04:29.540 --> 3:04:33.460]  But meanwhile the elites are going to get all the life extension technologies, that's
[3:04:33.460 --> 3:04:39.700]  what they call medicine a practice, they cold bloodedly practice on us and then develop
[3:04:39.700 --> 3:04:47.300]  what works, keep the good stuff of themselves, nothing for us but death, very cold blooded,
[3:04:47.300 --> 3:04:52.460]  they believe that's why they're the scientific risen man or the illumined man because they
[3:04:52.460 --> 3:04:57.260]  can cold bloodedly slaughter us, see our pain, just like the first psychiatrist lobotomizing
[3:04:57.260 --> 3:05:01.500]  people with ice picks.
[3:05:01.500 --> 3:05:05.300]  What can you do to keep you and your family safe from the resistant new strains of deadly

[3:06:09.140 --> 3:06:14.460]  highest quality superfood around called inner food, my wife just loves the stuff and now

[3:07:15.380 --> 3:07:20.780]  you every day, there is no job security, you are always in danger of losing your job unless

[3:08:02.820 --> 3:08:09.380]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues,

[3:08:54.740 --> 3:09:00.700]  exploding and that is heartening, it's also a little bit scary because there's a lot
[3:09:00.700 --> 3:09:05.780]  of black ops going on against us, a lot of people posing as us going around saying horrible
[3:09:05.780 --> 3:09:13.660]  racist things on the web, a lot of people pulling other dirty tricks and a lot of media
[3:09:13.660 --> 3:09:19.460]  coming after us, mainstream media coming after us and that really is our badge of courage,
[3:09:19.460 --> 3:09:25.620]  the red badge of courage as they say, I get so many emails going, you woke me up and now
[3:09:25.620 --> 3:09:29.860]  I know your new world order, so that's kind of how the Co and Tel Pro works as well, we're
[3:09:29.860 --> 3:09:34.300]  here just covering facts, information, data, you make what decisions you want from it,
[3:09:34.300 --> 3:09:38.580]  Co and Tel Pro spends all their time saying hi everybody else are government agents, there's
[3:09:38.580 --> 3:09:44.620]  actually not that many government agents as people would think, they're just there getting
[3:09:44.620 --> 3:09:48.060]  us all to fight with each other, Alan I want to spend a few minutes on that, the dirty
[3:09:48.060 --> 3:09:52.260]  tricks you've been through so we can try to get people to be aware of this and to stop
[3:09:52.260 --> 3:09:56.820]  spending their time knitting and infighting and also not believe something when they hear
[3:09:56.820 --> 3:10:00.780]  your voice edited weird or changed, they do that to me as well, we were talking about
[3:10:00.780 --> 3:10:05.740]  it or when they see sites that look like yours but aren't yours but don't list their URLs
[3:10:05.740 --> 3:10:10.820]  that only helps them, which then lists linked to white supremacist stuff, we've proven
[3:10:10.820 --> 3:10:14.380]  that the ADL and Southern Parvy Law Center and other groups are tied in, the case of
[3:10:14.380 --> 3:10:19.220]  Southern Parvy Law Center running white supremacist groups, FBI doesn't just infiltrate white
[3:10:19.220 --> 3:10:23.140]  supremacists, they found them, they run them, then they always try to act like they're the
[3:10:23.140 --> 3:10:27.820]  liberty movement, the freedom movement so the media can then demonize us, every time
[3:10:27.820 --> 3:10:32.340]  I have a big national reporter here they ask me do you like Hitler, Alex, and then I say
[3:10:32.340 --> 3:10:39.540]  no, I think he's really kind of goofy, oh you do like him, don't you, don't you, so
[3:10:39.540 --> 3:10:43.660]  this is really something they're trying to put on us because they don't want us bringing
[3:10:43.660 --> 3:10:49.220]  everybody in together for liberty and freedom and awakening against the tyranny of the globalist
[3:10:49.220 --> 3:10:55.980]  and so I'm really seeing them go after myself and you and a few other people and a lot of
[3:10:55.980 --> 3:11:02.020]  well-meaning people have kind of fallen in to the bashing one particular group or the
[3:11:02.020 --> 3:11:06.500]  other and that's how they want us is fact-shown-wise, down on what?
[3:11:06.500 --> 3:11:13.900]  Yes, true, a good documentary was done on the white supremacist groups a long time ago
[3:11:13.900 --> 3:11:21.100]  by the BBC where they showed you a different police outfits reading some of the headquarters
[3:11:21.100 --> 3:11:26.500]  where they're having meetings and one famous one, they turned out 200 people from inside
[3:11:26.500 --> 3:11:33.100]  this meeting and by the end of the night they'd only kept a couple and charged them, everyone
[3:11:33.100 --> 3:11:41.380]  else had turned out belonged to other departments of US police organizations that were all infiltrating
[3:11:41.380 --> 3:11:46.260]  and in other words the entire membership was made up almost of all government agents trying
[3:11:46.260 --> 3:11:50.700]  to find the real ones and the two that they arrested were just the guys off the street
[3:11:50.700 --> 3:11:57.140]  that came in for a free coffee, so it's common knowledge that the white supremacist groups
[3:11:57.140 --> 3:12:03.820]  have been funded from the beginning by government agencies because they're very handy to help
[3:12:03.820 --> 3:12:08.740]  smear people by association if they can do it, if they can't take it down by what you're
[3:12:08.740 --> 3:12:15.540]  saying they have to do a character assassination upon you and I've had videos up there I've
[3:12:15.540 --> 3:12:19.780]  seen them where people will take different words that you say string them together easy
[3:12:19.780 --> 3:12:25.780]  to do with the computer and have you seen completely erroneous things all together,
[3:12:25.780 --> 3:12:31.660]  but there is an organized effort out there and a funded effort I should say too to help
[3:12:31.660 --> 3:12:37.020]  the fame, I've had fake sites go up that you'd almost swear were mine and you had to go
[3:12:37.020 --> 3:12:41.860]  into them, take the links off them to find out who was behind it and if they went right
[3:12:41.860 --> 3:12:47.180]  to the usual thing it's just the Jews and it was anti-Semitic and so on, but for someone
[3:12:47.180 --> 3:12:53.060]  looking in they would have thought it was genuine and so I noticed I'm attacked by the ADL
[3:12:53.060 --> 3:12:56.900]  the Southern Prairie Law Center the first person they attacked when Poplasky shot those
[3:12:56.900 --> 3:13:03.860]  cops was me, within hours they fed my name, office, computer, thousands of sites to attack
[3:13:03.860 --> 3:13:07.580]  me and then it turned out that Poplasky didn't actually didn't like me, it looks like it was
[3:13:07.580 --> 3:13:12.540]  being federally handled, just like Von Brune and so that's kind of creepy you know I'm
[3:13:12.540 --> 3:13:16.900]  the first guy they're trying to go after now then meanwhile they have the white supremacists
[3:13:16.900 --> 3:13:22.260]  after me because I won't play the Southern Prairie Law Center's game of making it racial
[3:13:22.260 --> 3:13:28.420]  politics I'm trying to appeal to everybody, big tent, waking up the mass, they're desperate
[3:13:28.420 --> 3:13:35.540]  to at one level have the Nazis say I'm a Zionist agent and at the other end have the Israeli
[3:13:35.540 --> 3:13:40.660]  ops and others attacking me which shows these are jaws, top and bottom jaws on the same
[3:13:40.660 --> 3:13:41.660]  crocodile.
[3:13:41.660 --> 3:13:46.180]  Absolutely, they worked together, they've always worked together, there's no secret
[3:13:46.180 --> 3:13:52.420]  in that, one of the biggest cases in Canada, you probably remember Ernest Zundle, Ernest
[3:13:52.420 --> 3:13:56.780]  Zundle single-handedly managed to get what they wanted through in the court system and
[3:13:56.780 --> 3:14:02.060]  that was the hate laws but I could not figure out why in earth the Canadian government gave
[3:14:02.060 --> 3:14:06.220]  this man so much publicity, I mean he could have said nothing and no one would have ever
[3:14:06.220 --> 3:14:12.300]  heard of him and yet it was in all the national papers ongoing right after the Supreme Court
[3:14:12.300 --> 3:14:17.140]  where I think he was allowed to stay in Canada for a while but it came out in the Toronto
[3:14:17.140 --> 3:14:24.020]  Sun and the star a couple of years after all of this, there is right hand man in this white
[3:14:24.020 --> 3:14:30.180]  supremacist movement surrounded by skinheads, his right hand man was a guy called Grant
[3:14:30.180 --> 3:14:38.500]  Bristol who was a member of CECIS, the Canadian Security Intelligence Service and he was also
[3:14:38.500 --> 3:14:46.660]  Jewish, they were all working together, listen, when I was at Bilderberg 2006 they had these
[3:14:46.660 --> 3:14:51.140]  hippie guys show up going let's nuke the Bilderberg, let's nuke, they had these big royal amount
[3:14:51.140 --> 3:14:56.300]  of police types, you know the FBI type 6-3, good shape, acting friendly and I said look
[3:14:56.300 --> 3:14:59.580]  your feds aren't you to some of the other guys and some of them actually went, we're
[3:14:59.580 --> 3:15:03.740]  just doing our job Alex, just checking things and I was like yeah just doing your job trying
[3:15:03.740 --> 3:15:09.660]  to provocateur and I don't know how these cops live with themselves because they set
[3:15:09.660 --> 3:15:15.120]  up a lot of people and I know they're circling me like a pack of sharks and then they shoot
[3:15:15.120 --> 3:15:19.060]  their kids up with Mercury too, they give them fluoride, I mean you're killing your
[3:15:19.060 --> 3:15:24.820]  own kids, we're the good guys, why do you hate us so much but I guess they don't like
[3:15:24.820 --> 3:15:29.460]  us because they like their petty power trip and we're kind of reigning on their delusion
[3:15:29.460 --> 3:15:34.340]  that they're the cops and they frame the bad guys and that's how they get it done, what
[3:15:34.340 --> 3:15:36.820]  about the enforcers psychology, go ahead.
[3:15:36.820 --> 3:15:42.620]  Yeah they're on a team, you see they've literally militarized all police forces, they have done
[3:15:42.620 --> 3:15:47.300]  that for years, they use the same bonding techniques, super bonding techniques you get
[3:15:47.300 --> 3:15:52.500]  in the military where they stand up for each other, they're outside of city streets, they
[3:15:52.500 --> 3:15:57.420]  call it civilian street, they're special and the brotherhood is all, that's all there
[3:15:57.420 --> 3:16:02.220]  is, the brotherhood you must preserve, the brotherhood and really they can be kept in
[3:16:02.220 --> 3:16:06.300]  their own little paradigm, the little play-dohs cave where they themselves are kept dumb
[3:16:06.300 --> 3:16:10.660]  and stupid but they still want to succeed as a brotherhood and do what they're told,
[3:16:10.660 --> 3:16:14.740]  the field they're achieving something even though they don't even comprehend what the
[3:16:14.740 --> 3:16:19.980]  real goals are, so that's true, it's not the militarization of police, it's an old old
[3:16:19.980 --> 3:16:25.660]  technique that's been brought up to cool force now.
[3:16:25.660 --> 3:16:30.620]  What does the elite think of us, what is their view of an Ellen Water and Alex Jones, somebody
[3:16:30.620 --> 3:16:35.340]  that sees with horror their operation and their plan, I mean I certainly know they're
[3:16:35.340 --> 3:16:39.500]  trying to hurt us, trying to shut us down, why don't they just kill us, we get that question
[3:16:39.500 --> 3:16:40.500]  a lot.
[3:16:40.500 --> 3:16:46.700]  That they would never want even, they don't want marchers number one, marchers are bad
[3:16:46.700 --> 3:16:52.300]  news for any movement, they generally get so many recruits into a movement when someone
[3:16:52.300 --> 3:16:53.300]  killed.
[3:16:53.300 --> 3:16:58.260]  The CIA probably killed, they're now saying that Iranian girl, Nada, she's their cause
[3:16:58.260 --> 3:16:59.420]  celeb, go ahead.
[3:16:59.420 --> 3:17:06.540]  Oh yeah, and apart from that to be honest with you, I think they're so arrogant right
[3:17:06.540 --> 3:17:12.740]  now because they do with the internet, they take a daily pulse of the public, they know
[3:17:12.740 --> 3:17:16.660]  what they're chatting about, their text messages and so on, they know what their conversations
[3:17:16.660 --> 3:17:22.060]  are, it's all from TV and entertainment and so on, or major stories put in the paper
[3:17:22.060 --> 3:17:25.740]  for them to talk about, they're not really worried to go on it with you, I think and
[3:17:25.740 --> 3:17:30.060]  they're arrogant about the masses of the public, that's what I really, really think.
[3:17:30.060 --> 3:17:35.380]  Yeah, it's very, very sick, I mean you talk to these reporters who you know are working
[3:17:35.380 --> 3:17:39.500]  on the other side and they'll basically in private go, yeah I know that's the way it
[3:17:39.500 --> 3:17:42.740]  is, but what are you going to do about it, and they're kind of getting off like they're
[3:17:42.740 --> 3:17:48.060]  part of the system that they're, and I don't understand how they drink the fluoride, they
[3:17:48.060 --> 3:17:54.460]  take the shots, they die for it, but I guess it's the mind game of like dress-up or make-believe,
[3:17:54.460 --> 3:17:58.180]  they make-believe they're with it, it'd be like running out in front of a Mack truck
[3:17:58.180 --> 3:18:02.100]  going 100 miles an hour and going, I'm with you, I'm with you and it just splats you,
[3:18:02.100 --> 3:18:07.860]  but you feel like you were with it, so instead of just not jumping out in front of it, it's
[3:18:07.860 --> 3:18:15.020]  also comes into, you see this is the generation where they're pulling it off, previous generations
[3:18:15.020 --> 3:18:18.540]  the guys were basically prostitutes, they knew it would come down eventually on the
[3:18:18.540 --> 3:18:23.340]  general public, but not their generation, they've lived through, I'd be okay, this particular
[3:18:23.340 --> 3:18:28.900]  group are just as much in denial, I think, the general public, they can't believe it
[3:18:28.900 --> 3:18:34.460]  can be as bad as that, and they themselves may possibly come to infections or plagues
[3:18:34.460 --> 3:18:40.700]  or whatever is released, so they hope that just by simply being good and staying in
[3:18:40.700 --> 3:18:47.380]  denial they might be saved, be chosen, I should mention though that back in the 90s this happened
[3:18:47.380 --> 3:18:52.700]  across the Commonwealth, countries, Canada, the U.S., Australia, New Zealand, maybe in
[3:18:52.700 --> 3:18:59.020]  the States too, it came out when President Manning was in the parliament, the parliamentarians
[3:18:59.020 --> 3:19:05.460]  voted themselves the right to top medical treatment, and the country of socialized medicine
[3:19:05.460 --> 3:19:11.420]  remember, top medical treatment within, for them and their families only, and the high
[3:19:11.420 --> 3:19:17.020]  level bureaucrats within top military hospitals, and I thought, well what's this for?
[3:19:17.020 --> 3:19:19.540]  That's like North Korea, that's like North Korea.
[3:19:19.540 --> 3:19:23.660]  Yeah, so what they're getting, and this is how they get people on board, if you go along
[3:19:23.660 --> 3:19:28.180]  with this, you will be saved, we'll give you the top treatment, we'll give you the real
[3:19:28.180 --> 3:19:32.660]  inoculations, the real antidotes, et cetera, for you and your families, if you go along
[3:19:32.660 --> 3:19:38.900]  with this and you have all the organic foods to eat, et cetera, et cetera, that's the deal.
[3:19:38.900 --> 3:19:43.180]  Exactly, so out of fear of their own system they go, alright I'll help you murder them,
[3:19:43.180 --> 3:19:48.060]  alright I'll be evil, and they go, now you're with us, but there's always a night of the
[3:19:48.060 --> 3:19:54.180]  long knives for you, and you're gonna be betrayed just like those torturers, followed orders,
[3:19:54.180 --> 3:20:01.620]  and then Bush cut them loose, remember that, we'll be right back.

[3:21:39.140 --> 3:22:04.660]  on the average Americans work between 45 to 50 years hoping to build up enough wealth
[3:22:04.660 --> 3:22:09.660]  to retire and live out their golden years, unfortunately with taxation, the rising cost
[3:22:09.660 --> 3:22:14.500]  of food, energy, housing and medical, many retirees are forced to live below the poverty
[3:22:14.500 --> 3:22:18.860]  line, is this a flaw for enterprise or is our monetary unit we call the Federal Reserve
[3:22:18.860 --> 3:22:23.980]  note forcing us into perpetual debt, ensuring inflation and higher taxes, these questions
[3:22:23.980 --> 3:22:27.780]  and more can be answered by reading G. Edward Griffin's book, The Creature from Jekyll
[3:22:27.780 --> 3:22:32.340]  Island, Congressman Ron Paul states it's what every American needs to know about central

[3:23:07.900 --> 3:23:12.360]  drinking the water, that's because many chemicals are inhaled when they evaporate and others
[3:23:12.360 --> 3:23:17.300]  are absorbed into the skin, the KDF dual media shower filter works with both hot and cold

[3:24:22.140 --> 3:24:27.460]  this beauty around us, the atmosphere, the birds, the trees, flowers, life, I just sit
[3:24:27.460 --> 3:24:32.340]  there in my yard looking at the grass and little spider or bugs walking around, it's
[3:24:32.340 --> 3:24:38.020]  all majesty, meanwhile the Madison Avenue has you feeling insecure, all focused, feeling
[3:24:38.020 --> 3:24:43.580]  dirty, feeling weak and they've always got new poisons to sell you to supposedly fulfill
[3:24:43.580 --> 3:24:48.060]  you, Alan's agreed to stay with us the full transmission so another 35 minutes, very honored
[3:24:48.060 --> 3:24:54.820]  to have him with us, let's go ahead and go back to the calls, Deborah in Illinois, that's
[3:24:54.820 --> 3:25:00.140]  Steve, Gary, Jonathan, Tatina and others, Debbie you're on the air, go ahead.
[3:25:00.140 --> 3:25:08.580]  Hi Alex, hi Alan, thanks for everything you do to inform us, I'm calling in, I wanted
[3:25:08.580 --> 3:25:17.300]  to inform you, I had a local TV station do a hit number on me regarding the jet contrails
[3:25:17.300 --> 3:25:25.420]  that I've been watching spray us since March and I've been photographing, I said, yeah
[3:25:25.420 --> 3:25:30.580]  what they're doing is they simultaneously do pieces on locals saying it doesn't exist
[3:25:30.580 --> 3:25:35.140]  while telling you in the New York Times and Wall Street Journal in USA Today that oh we're
[3:25:35.140 --> 3:25:39.900]  spraying you now to save the earth but then see it's good when they say it but when you
[3:25:39.900 --> 3:25:47.020]  say hey you know contrails are ice, they stay there a minute or so, those stay there all
[3:25:47.020 --> 3:25:52.740]  day and turn into clouds, they go oh you're insane so what did the locals do to you?
[3:25:52.740 --> 3:26:00.420]  Well it's really crazy story, I called in to report all these jets, some days were worse
[3:26:00.420 --> 3:26:06.860]  than others and they seemed interested, they came out, they did an interview for an hour,
[3:26:06.860 --> 3:26:15.540]  then they took sound bites of what I said and then they put me up against a jet mechanic
[3:26:15.540 --> 3:26:23.620]  from the local college who said that chemicals aren't being sprayed and then I was also pitted
[3:26:23.620 --> 3:26:32.780]  up against a weather forecaster out of Chicago who said that the weather modification experiments
[3:26:32.780 --> 3:26:37.340]  were done in the 70s as far as he knew, there's not anymore being done.
[3:26:37.340 --> 3:26:43.060]  What, there's scores of US companies doing it full time publicly and hundreds of universities
[3:26:43.060 --> 3:26:46.940]  and government agencies openly admit they're doing it, the president's announcing they're
[3:26:46.940 --> 3:26:52.500]  getting ready to do it on a mass scale and but see this is the example of how the propaganda
[3:26:52.500 --> 3:26:58.740]  works and these locals feel like they're powerful, they're part of the system exposing this kook
[3:26:58.740 --> 3:27:01.980]  but really they're in Plato's cave, Alan Watt comments.
[3:27:01.980 --> 3:27:07.140]  Yes true, again it's almost double think they're kept in double think, in fact you're
[3:27:07.140 --> 3:27:12.180]  taught to deny your own senses, that's the key to it when you see them yourself, you're
[3:27:12.180 --> 3:27:16.340]  taught that can't be happening, the media would have told me so, that's how most people
[3:27:16.340 --> 3:27:21.820]  reason today, the media does their reasoning for them according to Brzezinski, but yes
[3:27:21.820 --> 3:27:26.580]  they will poo poo you when you see them in your local area and they'll even tell you
[3:27:26.580 --> 3:27:31.100]  well they might be spraying but not where you are as it was some freak sort of thing
[3:27:31.100 --> 3:27:37.740]  if it occurred over your head but yeah they've been spraying daily almost since 1998 and
[3:27:37.740 --> 3:27:42.260]  I remember the first day it started in Ontario, they were half the height, the whole sky was
[3:27:42.260 --> 3:27:47.260]  a grid on the very first day and that's when the bronchial problems started with everyone,
[3:27:47.260 --> 3:27:52.380]  it got so bad three, four years ago most of the birds were dead and they've changed their
[3:27:52.380 --> 3:27:56.820]  mixes even if they go along, they don't do the poo spray generally across the entire
[3:27:56.820 --> 3:28:02.660]  sky, they do it in short bursts that turn into clouds more rapidly but this is all stuff
[3:28:02.660 --> 3:28:07.820]  and I've covered it to tell her that the guy who invented the H-bomb was the guy who brought
[3:28:07.820 --> 3:28:15.500]  to the Pentagon the whole idea of floating lots of particles of barium, aluminum oxide
[3:28:15.500 --> 3:28:21.380]  and various other metals into the atmosphere using a standing wave technology like harp
[3:28:21.380 --> 3:28:27.340]  along with it to create weather modification and that went all the way to the present
[3:28:27.340 --> 3:28:32.740]  United States and the Pentagon actually worked on it at the time, it's a very old agenda
[3:28:32.740 --> 3:28:35.700]  and it's in use now, yeah.
[3:28:35.700 --> 3:28:38.260]  Absolutely, so how did this end?
[3:28:38.260 --> 3:28:41.740]  Just that you're an evil thought criminal, everybody get old and laughed and said Merkley
[3:28:41.740 --> 3:28:42.740]  was good for them?
[3:28:42.740 --> 3:28:50.180]  No, but the crazy part about it was then a month prior to that we had mysterious goo
[3:28:50.180 --> 3:28:59.700]  left on lawns and they did a story on that and you can go to MyStateLine.com and search
[3:28:59.700 --> 3:29:07.020]  for mysterious goo left on lawn and that was done on May 7th and then you can also go to
[3:29:07.020 --> 3:29:13.300]  what's that slimy gel the next day they did another piece and that's May 8th.
[3:29:13.300 --> 3:29:17.740]  All right, thank you, ma'am, go ahead.
[3:29:17.740 --> 3:29:22.500]  We actually had gel and people gel on it.
[3:29:22.500 --> 3:29:26.620]  That's what they had in Scotland, the Scottish newspapers are also, we actually have photographs
[3:29:26.620 --> 3:29:29.500]  of this mysterious gel that's breaking all over the Highlands.
[3:29:29.500 --> 3:29:32.300]  Yeah, we got a break here, ma'am, thank you.
[3:29:32.300 --> 3:29:36.260]  Meanwhile, the media never looks at the Daily Oklahoma or hundreds of other papers when
[3:29:36.260 --> 3:29:40.660]  they admit, oh, Homeland Security will spray every town in the state of Oklahoma, this
[3:29:40.660 --> 3:29:47.340]  was in 2006, with subtilist globally bacteria, don't worry it only causes spontaneous abortions
[3:29:47.340 --> 3:29:53.140]  in all mammal species, that's in the news and they just go, I love it, we're on the March,
[3:29:53.140 --> 3:30:01.380]  the Empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[3:30:01.380 --> 3:30:05.820]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[3:30:05.820 --> 3:30:06.820]  this summer.
[3:30:06.820 --> 3:30:10.700]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[3:30:10.700 --> 3:30:15.260]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[3:30:15.260 --> 3:30:16.500]  allows you to have.
[3:30:16.500 --> 3:30:21.660]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[3:30:21.660 --> 3:30:25.700]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded,
[3:30:25.700 --> 3:30:28.180]  especially with the high demand summer months ahead.
[3:30:28.180 --> 3:30:31.740]  Number four, the hurricane and dangerous summer storm season is here again.
[3:30:31.740 --> 3:30:35.420]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related outages.
[3:30:35.420 --> 3:30:39.980]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[3:30:39.980 --> 3:30:44.100]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[3:30:44.100 --> 3:30:45.780]  a long time sponsor of ours.

[3:35:27.260 --> 3:35:32.900]  Yes, Alex, you're always talking about gibbering, but you never talk about praddling and dribbling
[3:35:32.900 --> 3:35:38.220]  and specifically double dribbling, and White's shameless on you.
[3:35:38.220 --> 3:35:41.660]  First of all, White, there's no such thing in the Scottish newspapers.

[3:35:45.660 --> 3:35:46.660]  Hold on just a minute.
[3:35:46.660 --> 3:35:47.660]  Put Steve on hold.
[3:35:47.660 --> 3:35:49.140]  Steve always calls up.
[3:35:49.140 --> 3:35:53.180]  I recognize the caller and sometimes says good things, sometimes says really strange
[3:35:53.180 --> 3:35:54.180]  things.
[3:35:54.180 --> 3:35:58.860]  Alan White, everything he's talked about today is on his website, HeatherTheMatrix.com.
[3:35:58.860 --> 3:36:02.740]  Almost everything he discusses, I've read out of these globalist own books.
[3:36:02.740 --> 3:36:04.860]  Alan White is a great source of info.
[3:36:04.860 --> 3:36:10.980]  I demand, or I'm hanging up on you, Steve, you specifically call Alan out on what you're
[3:36:10.980 --> 3:36:15.260]  saying he's lying about or what is not in the Scottish newspapers.
[3:36:15.260 --> 3:36:17.660]  Come on, tell me right now, Steve.
[3:36:17.660 --> 3:36:22.860]  I'm talking specifically about the Scotsman newspaper, and I'm talking about his ChemTrail
[3:36:22.860 --> 3:36:25.500]  article, but I've got a couple interesting facts.
[3:36:25.500 --> 3:36:27.820]  You asked about James Von Braun.
[3:36:27.820 --> 3:36:34.620]  He's distant cousin of Cobb Von Stauffenberg, because the family's intermarried in the 1400s,
[3:36:34.620 --> 3:36:38.900]  and secondly, he's descended from German bishops, and the German bishops find it funny.
[3:36:38.900 --> 3:36:41.700]  You know what I'm just talking about about Germans, we're not talking about bad about
[3:36:41.700 --> 3:36:42.700]  Germans.
[3:36:42.700 --> 3:36:43.700]  I'm part German myself.
[3:36:43.700 --> 3:36:45.700]  We're talking about Von Braun being a federal plant.
[3:36:45.700 --> 3:36:46.900]  Now listen to me.
[3:36:46.900 --> 3:36:49.580]  ChemTrails are in the Wall Street Journal.
[3:36:49.580 --> 3:36:50.900]  They're all over the British news.
[3:36:50.900 --> 3:36:55.460]  They're telling you how they're going to terraform for your own safety to fix the global warming
[3:36:55.460 --> 3:36:58.660]  when the climatologists we talked to say it'll heat the earth up.
[3:36:58.660 --> 3:36:59.780]  Here's the Wall Street Journal.
[3:36:59.780 --> 3:37:03.500]  It's time to cool the planet, and they say with ChemTrailing.
[3:37:03.500 --> 3:37:09.460]  So I'm saying to you, hey, you know what, put him on hold, Alan, go ahead.
[3:37:09.460 --> 3:37:13.180]  I bet from memory you can even tell him the article or pull it up.
[3:37:13.180 --> 3:37:15.340]  Specifically, what were you saying out of the Scotsman?
[3:37:15.340 --> 3:37:19.940]  Yeah, the Scottish, not just the Scotsman, it was all over the Scottish papers, the
[3:37:19.940 --> 3:37:25.100]  mysterious gel they're calling it, found over highland areas, and they brought in all the
[3:37:25.100 --> 3:37:31.100]  different characters and scientists and trying to explain it away as possible.
[3:37:31.100 --> 3:37:32.580]  In fact, let's do it right now.
[3:37:32.580 --> 3:37:35.700]  Let's say mysterious gel in Scotland.
[3:37:35.700 --> 3:37:36.700]  Google that.
[3:37:36.700 --> 3:37:39.460]  Let's just hit him with the info and hit him hard right now.
[3:37:39.460 --> 3:37:40.700]  You're calling us out.
[3:37:40.700 --> 3:37:43.420]  I just showed you Cohen talking about weather weapons.
[3:37:43.420 --> 3:37:44.420]  I don't understand this.
[3:37:44.420 --> 3:37:46.140]  We're here trying to do a good job.
[3:37:46.140 --> 3:37:50.900]  We're all over the news admitting, all over England, headlines, plague bombs released
[3:37:50.900 --> 3:37:56.020]  over Scotland, another headline, all of England's sprayed with chemicals and biologicals and
[3:37:56.020 --> 3:37:57.020]  tests.
[3:37:57.020 --> 3:37:58.020]  It's all in my film in-game.
[3:37:58.020 --> 3:38:00.540]  I mean, we're telling the truth.
[3:38:00.540 --> 3:38:05.140]  Well, you don't understand, though, Alex, there are people out there that are in their
[3:38:05.140 --> 3:38:09.500]  own little, say, those caves, and all they'll do is attack and smear.
[3:38:09.500 --> 3:38:12.540]  It doesn't matter how much proof you give them, it doesn't make any difference.
[3:38:12.540 --> 3:38:16.100]  They have their own little agendas, and you can't get into their headspace because it's
[3:38:16.100 --> 3:38:18.900]  their personal little private place.
[3:38:18.900 --> 3:38:23.620]  Oh, there is the jelly mystery, BBC.
[3:38:23.620 --> 3:38:25.020]  Let's click on that.
[3:38:25.020 --> 3:38:28.300]  Oh, we don't make anything up here.
[3:38:28.300 --> 3:38:33.300]  I don't understand, Alan, how we're at a higher standard than the New World Order always
[3:38:33.300 --> 3:38:35.740]  engaging in their activities.
[3:38:35.740 --> 3:38:36.740]  Why are we bad?
[3:38:36.740 --> 3:38:41.060]  Is it the psychology of crabs not wanting other crabs to get out of a bucket?
[3:38:41.060 --> 3:38:42.060]  I think so.
[3:38:42.060 --> 3:38:46.460]  It's also that a lot of people out there want to live in utter denial because they just
[3:38:46.460 --> 3:38:48.300]  don't like you or what you're saying.
[3:38:48.300 --> 3:38:50.740]  It's as simple as that.
[3:38:50.740 --> 3:38:55.500]  All right, Scott, we just Googled mysterious gel in Scotland.
[3:38:55.500 --> 3:38:59.660]  Our internet's so lightning slow that it's not even loading yet, but there it all is
[3:38:59.660 --> 3:39:06.620]  all over the news about mysterious substance gel falling from the sky.
[3:39:06.620 --> 3:39:08.100]  So what do you say to that, Steve?
[3:39:08.100 --> 3:39:09.500]  We're still liars?
[3:39:09.500 --> 3:39:16.620]  Certainly, he's James Bondage, my sixth control officer, or either John Bullcrap, my sixth
[3:39:16.620 --> 3:39:23.380]  chaos agent, because the story is that everybody knows that the stories from the BBC and the
[3:39:23.380 --> 3:39:27.500]  Daily Mail never make it or Daily Mail never make it in the Scottish newspapers because
[3:39:27.500 --> 3:39:28.500]  that's all propaganda.
[3:39:28.500 --> 3:39:29.500]  What?
[3:39:29.500 --> 3:39:30.500]  We're done with you.
[3:39:30.500 --> 3:39:31.500]  We're done with you.
[3:39:31.500 --> 3:39:32.500]  We're done with you.
[3:39:32.500 --> 3:39:37.620]  You can make up one lie and you make up another.
[3:39:37.620 --> 3:39:39.620]  I just don't understand the mental illness, man.
[3:39:39.620 --> 3:39:40.620]  What?
[3:39:40.620 --> 3:39:41.620]  I didn't do anything to you, brother.
[3:39:41.620 --> 3:39:45.260]  You were talking about chemical and biological testing.
[3:39:45.260 --> 3:39:48.620]  Google this for everybody, guys, and print me that while you're at it.
[3:39:48.620 --> 3:39:53.980]  I want to show the viewers this because one of the big ones that got a lot of attention
[3:39:53.980 --> 3:39:58.020]  was Subtilis Globally Spray It Over Oklahoma.
[3:39:58.020 --> 3:40:04.300]  Subtilis Globa G and another Subtilis, I can't remember the exact name, Daily Oklahoma.
[3:40:04.300 --> 3:40:08.740]  It said, every town was having fixed-wing aircraft spray it and they said, oh, it's
[3:40:08.740 --> 3:40:14.300]  not bad for you, though it does cause abortion, you know, it does cause a miscarriage.
[3:40:14.300 --> 3:40:16.860]  Alan, go ahead, make your comment.
[3:40:16.860 --> 3:40:25.020]  Yes, and this stuff has been tested before, Espanola and Ontario was the target, US planes
[3:40:25.020 --> 3:40:28.660]  were given permission to do it over that area.
[3:40:28.660 --> 3:40:32.860]  People in Espanola were having miscarriages, even the animals that you were having miscarriages,
[3:40:32.860 --> 3:40:37.900]  it was all the way to the Supreme Court of Canada, where it was admitted it was an experiment
[3:40:37.900 --> 3:40:41.740]  that the Canadian government couldn't do anything because they themselves were not responsible.
[3:40:41.740 --> 3:40:46.980]  That's how they panned it off on the US, and that was the mainstream papers here.
[3:40:46.980 --> 3:40:50.100]  We're just any pigs straw of this.
[3:40:50.100 --> 3:40:53.940]  Well, I mean, I don't know what to do for people anymore.
[3:40:53.940 --> 3:41:02.540]  They've all got their little niche group and if you hear them, I just want to get people
[3:41:02.540 --> 3:41:03.540]  fighting new order.
[3:41:03.540 --> 3:41:05.700]  I want them to stop all the chemical-biological testing.
[3:41:05.700 --> 3:41:11.940]  I've actually had people, you probably found this too, that have accused me of being a
[3:41:11.940 --> 3:41:16.300]  spy because I shouldn't know as much as I do.
[3:41:16.300 --> 3:41:20.020]  One guy actually wrote to me and he says, why were you in libraries when you were a child
[3:41:20.020 --> 3:41:21.900]  studying this stuff?
[3:41:21.900 --> 3:41:27.540]  So anything that's beyond themselves or outside of what they were up to, you must be a strange,
[3:41:27.540 --> 3:41:28.540]  weird, special character.
[3:41:28.540 --> 3:41:32.900]  No, I know, I had psychology today asking me how I got into all this, and I said, well,
[3:41:32.900 --> 3:41:36.540]  I was reading a lot of history books when I was a kid, and they're like, how strange,
[3:41:36.540 --> 3:41:40.300]  how weird, how, and I was like, well, no, it was actually very entertaining.
[3:41:40.300 --> 3:41:42.780]  I was doing it for entertainment at the time.
[3:41:42.780 --> 3:41:46.740]  It was a lot better than Pulp Fiction or Louis Lamour books I was reading, and they were
[3:41:46.740 --> 3:41:54.420]  just like, hmm, how, oh, and then if you're ever at a, I was at a target buying some t-shirts
[3:41:54.420 --> 3:41:58.860]  a few weeks ago because I've lost some weight, so I had to get some smaller clothes.
[3:41:58.860 --> 3:42:03.340]  And I went over to the video section and got downfall about Hitler, which I'd seen in
[3:42:03.340 --> 3:42:06.780]  the theaters, very, very accurate about him in the bunker.
[3:42:06.780 --> 3:42:10.700]  And the guy kind of freaked out at the checkout counter and was looking at me and like, had
[3:42:10.700 --> 3:42:15.020]  it and going, because he saw Hitler, it meant I was with Hitler.
[3:42:15.020 --> 3:42:19.660]  And I remember when I was a teenager, I bought my comp to read what Hitler had said.
[3:42:19.660 --> 3:42:23.900]  And the lady asked me if I was a white supremacist and was very upset, and I said, why are you
[3:42:23.900 --> 3:42:25.140]  selling it, lady?
[3:42:25.140 --> 3:42:26.980]  No, I'm reading it for history.
[3:42:26.980 --> 3:42:29.620]  I read a book by Julius Caesar.
[3:42:29.620 --> 3:42:31.140]  I've read books by Shakespeare.
[3:42:31.140 --> 3:42:33.340]  It doesn't mean I'm Shakespeare either.
[3:42:33.340 --> 3:42:37.500]  You know, they say people seem videos with me with a sprint telephone.
[3:42:37.500 --> 3:42:39.940]  They say I'm, oh, God, we blew up the video.
[3:42:39.940 --> 3:42:40.940]  It's sprint.
[3:42:40.940 --> 3:42:42.060]  He works for sprint.
[3:42:42.060 --> 3:42:46.300]  Or there's actually sites saying I have a Nyman microphone.
[3:42:46.300 --> 3:42:51.340]  That means I'm a Nazi because Hitler at speeches had Nyman microphones.
[3:42:51.340 --> 3:42:52.900]  It's proof I'm with Hitler.
[3:42:52.900 --> 3:42:54.980]  I mean, you know, it's mental illness.
[3:42:54.980 --> 3:42:58.860]  There's all this real stuff happening, but they can't deal with any of that.
[3:42:58.860 --> 3:43:02.340]  They got to make it us, Alan, we're, we're, we're, we're what's bad.
[3:43:02.340 --> 3:43:03.340]  But that's correct.
[3:43:03.340 --> 3:43:05.620]  And I, and those people, you have to simply dismiss.
[3:43:05.620 --> 3:43:09.260]  I've actually had one woman say, the people like you scare me.
[3:43:09.260 --> 3:43:10.900]  I said, well, why?
[3:43:10.900 --> 3:43:11.900]  You're too intelligent.
[3:43:11.900 --> 3:43:13.620]  She says, you remember everything.
[3:43:13.620 --> 3:43:14.620]  I don't remember.
[3:43:14.620 --> 3:43:15.620]  I don't remember anything.
[3:43:15.620 --> 3:43:17.620]  She said, well, that's not my fault.
[3:43:17.620 --> 3:43:18.620]  That's not my fault.
[3:43:18.620 --> 3:43:20.620]  She can't remember anything.
[3:43:20.620 --> 3:43:26.020]  But you got to just simply dismiss these people because if, if, if you use your intellect,
[3:43:26.020 --> 3:43:27.660]  they're paranoid about you.
[3:43:27.660 --> 3:43:28.660]  They're paranoid.
[3:43:28.660 --> 3:43:31.180]  These people live in TV land.
[3:43:31.180 --> 3:43:32.460]  That's where all the stuff comes from.
[3:43:32.460 --> 3:43:38.300]  They live in fiction most of the time, or in sports or in dramas or soaps or cop shows.
[3:43:38.300 --> 3:43:42.340]  And really they, they're suspicious of you because you're different.
[3:43:42.340 --> 3:43:44.260]  You want to know what's going on.
[3:43:44.260 --> 3:43:45.740]  They've decided not to.
[3:43:45.740 --> 3:43:52.420]  Well, let me take Henry Rollins, he was reading a neocon book that was pro war in memory serves,
[3:43:52.420 --> 3:43:53.580]  but it said something about terror.
[3:43:53.580 --> 3:43:55.060]  I think it was Simon and Schuster.
[3:43:55.060 --> 3:43:56.380]  It was a best selling book.
[3:43:56.380 --> 3:43:58.140]  He's on an airplane from Australia.
[3:43:58.140 --> 3:44:01.220]  They went ahead and took his book and arrested him and they said, you're not allowed to
[3:44:01.220 --> 3:44:02.220]  read books.
[3:44:02.220 --> 3:44:06.060]  I mean, I've seen people when I'm reading a book, they come over to, what are you reading?
[3:44:06.060 --> 3:44:07.060]  You're reading.
[3:44:07.060 --> 3:44:11.100]  It's almost like, you know, like the Monty Python joke of, look, this one knows how to
[3:44:11.100 --> 3:44:13.180]  speak or this one knows how to read.
[3:44:13.180 --> 3:44:14.580]  It's like, my God.
[3:44:14.580 --> 3:44:22.980]  He, you know, yeah, here it is, K O C O bio terrorism test scheduled over central Oklahoma.
[3:44:22.980 --> 3:44:23.980]  Click on that one.
[3:44:23.980 --> 3:44:25.580]  And there's a bunch of other news.
[3:44:25.580 --> 3:44:26.580]  I don't know.
[3:44:26.580 --> 3:44:35.300]  This is the subtelus global G story, but, uh, goals be selected for bio terrorism drill.
[3:44:35.300 --> 3:44:41.340]  I mean, they do it everywhere, but after you're done showing that Google this, plague bombs
[3:44:41.340 --> 3:44:49.700]  tested over Scotland and then they admit just constant spraying since the forties of Canada,
[3:44:49.700 --> 3:44:54.940]  the United States and England, projects, shad, nerve gassing, people on ships telling troops
[3:44:54.940 --> 3:45:00.500]  they're going in to have, have a CS gas tested on them and they hit them with nerve gas and
[3:45:00.500 --> 3:45:05.300]  kill them all declassified, Alan, and you're bad for talking about it.
[3:45:05.300 --> 3:45:08.180]  You're with the government because you don't want them to do it.
[3:45:08.180 --> 3:45:09.980]  That makes total sense, doesn't it?
[3:45:09.980 --> 3:45:15.980]  That's the way the logic runs now, bio terrorism test scheduled over central Oklahoma, materials
[3:45:15.980 --> 3:45:18.900]  simulating chemical threat to be dropped on areas.
[3:45:18.900 --> 3:45:21.060]  That's 2003.
[3:45:21.060 --> 3:45:22.060]  Print me that.
[3:45:22.060 --> 3:45:31.940]  Oh, it said chemicals to simulate, but then it says Bacillus, Thrun and Genesis, BT.
[3:45:31.940 --> 3:45:33.500]  But then when you go on to read, it was another one.
[3:45:33.500 --> 3:45:38.780]  They were turned to be a whole group of bacteria, which caused spontaneous abortion.
[3:45:38.780 --> 3:45:40.380]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[3:45:40.380 --> 3:45:49.380]  It's astonishing that there's no lack of data, there's even mainstream TV articles on the
[3:45:49.380 --> 3:45:55.820]  yellow stuff that's come down in some areas of the US and it was tested by the TV, the
[3:45:55.820 --> 3:46:01.060]  people, and it was cadmium and cadmium and aluminum oxide and that was only about a year
[3:46:01.060 --> 3:46:02.060]  ago.
[3:46:02.060 --> 3:46:06.340]  The link is on my site in the archives, there's a mainline TV station, it showed you it and
[3:46:06.340 --> 3:46:08.740]  it showed you the guys covered with the stuff.
[3:46:08.740 --> 3:46:11.940]  It was not pollen, the first thing I'll hit you with was pollen.
[3:46:11.940 --> 3:46:16.860]  Well, I had it here in February a couple of years ago and the leaves didn't even come
[3:46:16.860 --> 3:46:17.860]  out where I am.
[3:46:17.860 --> 3:46:26.460]  Listen, we had, we had in Belton and other places, people who didn't say black helicopters
[3:46:26.460 --> 3:46:30.740]  with flower with spray bottles and spray people and then Mike Hansen was doing construction
[3:46:30.740 --> 3:46:35.860]  work one day on a hilltop and watched a helicopter fly over and spray a schoolyard and then it
[3:46:35.860 --> 3:46:41.220]  was on the news, everybody was collapsing without even knowing about the helicopters,
[3:46:41.220 --> 3:46:43.220]  the hospitals were filled with people.
[3:46:43.220 --> 3:46:48.820]  I mean, this is going on here and we even film it, but you know what, that guy was engaged
[3:46:48.820 --> 3:46:52.020]  in double, triple, quadruple thing.
[3:46:52.020 --> 3:46:57.420]  He said that you were basically lying about the gel and then when it was BBC, he said
[3:46:57.420 --> 3:47:03.180]  well that's British propaganda, the Scots don't lie, so I want you guys to search.
[3:47:03.180 --> 3:47:07.620]  What was the headline you were saying, something mysterious gel or mystery gel Scotland?
[3:47:07.620 --> 3:47:08.620]  That's right.
[3:47:08.620 --> 3:47:14.180]  Oh, there it is, Nazis tested crude atomic bomb before end of war, now that's the Scotsman.
[3:47:14.180 --> 3:47:19.500]  It was plague bombs, bomb, it's plague bombs tested over Scotland's what I want, plague
[3:47:19.500 --> 3:47:21.140]  bombs.
[3:47:21.140 --> 3:47:22.300]  Now you're going to get the headline.
[3:47:22.300 --> 3:47:26.100]  We got to show these people, people wonder how I get these articles, they go you must
[3:47:26.100 --> 3:47:27.100]  be an agent.
[3:47:27.100 --> 3:47:31.180]  Well, I see, I put the word in and I look at it.
[3:47:31.180 --> 3:47:36.020]  How naval intelligence tested lethal plague bombs in Scotland.
[3:47:36.020 --> 3:47:37.660]  That's fine articles.
[3:47:37.660 --> 3:47:41.220]  Listen, here's the one I want for everybody out there.
[3:47:41.220 --> 3:47:49.780]  I want to show him Scotsman, mysterious gel Scotland, Scotsman.com, mysterious gel Scotland.
[3:47:49.780 --> 3:47:52.300]  And then we'll show him this and he won't be able to compute.
[3:47:52.300 --> 3:47:59.860]  He'll just go Vatican agent, agent, devil agent, devil agent, he's bad, he doesn't
[3:47:59.860 --> 3:48:01.180]  want them testing on me.
[3:48:01.180 --> 3:48:02.180]  He's wed them.
[3:48:02.180 --> 3:48:06.740]  He's wed them because again, they don't want to see someone making them face the tyranny
[3:48:06.740 --> 3:48:08.300]  and then warn others.
[3:48:08.300 --> 3:48:13.100]  It's all about also being an elitist in the conspiracy slash patriot movement going, only
[3:48:13.100 --> 3:48:15.460]  I understand everyone else is an agent.
[3:48:15.460 --> 3:48:16.460]  No one's good.
[3:48:16.460 --> 3:48:17.780]  What do you call that mental illness?
[3:48:17.780 --> 3:48:20.980]  That's the sort of pyrophonia you call it.
[3:48:20.980 --> 3:48:23.140]  Well, it's just insane.
[3:48:23.140 --> 3:48:28.220]  All I'm trying to do is save my family here.
[3:48:28.220 --> 3:48:29.220]  Here it is.
[3:48:29.220 --> 3:48:30.220]  I got another BBC.
[3:48:30.220 --> 3:48:33.500]  I'm going to find it.
[3:48:33.500 --> 3:48:34.500]  Do Scotsman.com.
[3:48:34.500 --> 3:48:40.500]  You got to put Scotsman.com after the Scotsman right there to find it.
[3:48:40.500 --> 3:48:41.980]  That's the way you got to do that on.
[3:48:41.980 --> 3:48:42.980]  All right.
[3:48:42.980 --> 3:48:43.980]  I'm sorry, Ellen.
[3:48:43.980 --> 3:48:44.980]  I'm out of control today.
[3:48:44.980 --> 3:48:45.980]  That's Scotsman.com.
[3:48:45.980 --> 3:48:48.780]  Probably the secret code for MI6 agents.
[3:48:48.780 --> 3:48:49.780]  Exactly.
[3:48:49.780 --> 3:48:53.380]  Now, the MI6 agents are actually attacking us.
[3:48:53.380 --> 3:49:01.140]  I got attacked by the BBC yesterday, by the way.
[3:49:01.140 --> 3:49:03.540]  There's a Scotsman mentioning it, but it's its main page.
[3:49:03.540 --> 3:49:05.500]  I'm going to find that and put it up there for him.
[3:49:05.500 --> 3:49:06.780]  He won't know what to do, though, about it.
[3:49:06.780 --> 3:49:10.580]  But see, it all becomes the mental illness of showing it that's in the Scotsman instead
[3:49:10.580 --> 3:49:13.580]  of the fact that there's this mysterious jelly being sprayed everywhere.
[3:49:13.580 --> 3:49:14.700]  Gary in Texas.
[3:49:14.700 --> 3:49:15.700]  Go ahead.
[3:49:15.700 --> 3:49:16.700]  Go ahead, Gary.
[3:49:16.700 --> 3:49:17.700]  Hey, Alex.
[3:49:17.700 --> 3:49:18.700]  What's going on?
[3:49:18.700 --> 3:49:19.700]  We're on the air worldwide.
[3:49:19.700 --> 3:49:29.940]  I just wanted to touch real quick on this private bill, and Obama real quick, if I couldn't,
[3:49:29.940 --> 3:49:36.780]  because some of the responses I get from people will not tell him the direct quotes from what
[3:49:36.780 --> 3:49:42.940]  he ran in his campaign to what he says on the issues now, and I was going to do that
[3:49:42.940 --> 3:49:43.940]  today.
[3:49:43.940 --> 3:49:47.820]  I've got, I've got five videos of him saying he will not do any signing statements.
[3:49:47.820 --> 3:49:51.940]  I've got four or five videos where he says he will not raise any taxes, but $250,000
[3:49:51.940 --> 3:49:52.940]  or above.
[3:49:52.940 --> 3:49:57.220]  And now he's saying, I never said that, and the Obama people go, he never said that.
[3:49:57.220 --> 3:49:58.220]  Shut up!
[3:49:58.220 --> 3:50:00.980]  Go ahead.
[3:50:00.980 --> 3:50:05.060]  And the response I get is, oh, he's great.
[3:50:05.060 --> 3:50:07.300]  He's going to be great for the country.
[3:50:07.300 --> 3:50:14.980]  And the biggest thing is he shows how far society has come for civil rights issues for
[3:50:14.980 --> 3:50:15.980]  the African Americans.
[3:50:15.980 --> 3:50:22.660]  No, he's got, he's got dark skin so he can double the eugenics on the blacks.
[3:50:22.660 --> 3:50:25.140]  He's here to bring death to Africa and African.
[3:50:25.140 --> 3:50:27.340]  Let's get a comment from Alan Wadd on that.
[3:50:27.340 --> 3:50:33.140]  Well, to see that, that committee that set up for a comparative effectiveness in health
[3:50:33.140 --> 3:50:38.940]  care is a vast reduction of health care when you look into what they're all about is taking
[3:50:38.940 --> 3:50:39.940]  away your health care.
[3:50:39.940 --> 3:50:41.980]  That's what he hit the poorest first at the bottom.
[3:50:41.980 --> 3:50:42.980]  Yeah.
[3:50:42.980 --> 3:50:43.980]  Yeah, Gary, stay there.
[3:50:43.980 --> 3:50:44.980]  I'll let you finish your report real quick.
[3:50:44.980 --> 3:50:45.980]  I want to get to at least three calls.
[3:50:45.980 --> 3:50:46.980]  Jonathan and Tatina.
[3:50:46.980 --> 3:50:49.100]  I want to get to at least three calls in the side Alan Wadd.
[3:50:49.100 --> 3:50:54.980]  An amazing interview, shaping up to be a two hour, 50 minutes long, prisonplanet.tv, infowars.com,
[3:50:54.980 --> 3:51:01.720]  at the sites, get my film in gang, get it out to everybody, deprogram the slaves.
[3:51:01.720 --> 3:51:04.780]  Have you ever thought about what's in your shampoo, soap or detergent?
[3:51:04.780 --> 3:51:10.420]  How about chlorides, dyes, ethanol, sulfate, sodium, formaldehyde, and more?
[3:51:10.420 --> 3:51:14.960]  Even fragrance can indicate the presence of some 4,000 separate ingredients, most of which
[3:51:14.960 --> 3:51:15.960]  are synthetic.
[3:51:15.960 --> 3:51:17.380]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[3:51:17.380 --> 3:51:21.100]  I was shocked when I discovered I could be inhaling these additives that can lead to
[3:51:21.100 --> 3:51:25.580]  coughing, wheezing, and shortness of breath, headaches, nausea, irritation of the skin,
[3:51:25.580 --> 3:51:26.580]  and mucous membranes.
[3:51:26.580 --> 3:51:32.300]  Now compare Calben Pure Soap, all natural, earth friendly, no harsh chemicals, no animal
[3:51:32.300 --> 3:51:37.340]  testing, they're safe, and you save 85% of the money you're spending on cleaning products
[3:51:37.340 --> 3:51:38.340]  now.

[3:51:41.820 --> 3:51:49.460]  If it's natural, call Calben Pure Soap for a free catalog at 1-800-340-7091 or log on
[3:51:49.460 --> 3:51:51.300]  to 5starsoap.com.

[3:51:55.820 --> 3:52:02.100]  Call 1-800-340-7091 for all your cleaning needs.
[3:52:02.100 --> 3:52:08.180]  In the New World Order's War Against Humanity, Barack Obama is the tip of the spear.
[3:52:08.180 --> 3:52:12.660]  You've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of
[3:52:12.660 --> 3:52:13.980]  us would like to see.
[3:52:13.980 --> 3:52:19.140]  The Obama deception completely destroys the myth that Obama is working for the best interest
[3:52:19.140 --> 3:52:20.540]  of the American people.
[3:52:20.540 --> 3:52:24.900]  While Obama's already fudging, fudged since day one in this election.
[3:52:24.900 --> 3:52:29.980]  If you have a demagogue with a fanatical mass movement of personality cultists who is imposing
[3:52:29.980 --> 3:52:38.100]  the program of a group of extreme bankers and finance oligarchs, that's fascism.
[3:52:38.100 --> 3:52:41.660]  It's not about left or right, it's about a one-world government.
[3:52:41.660 --> 3:52:48.580]  This film documents who Obama works for, the lies he is told, and his real agenda.
[3:52:48.580 --> 3:52:54.140]  Get your copy of the Obama deception today at infowars.com or download it in super high
[3:52:54.140 --> 3:52:56.740]  quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[3:52:56.740 --> 3:53:01.060]  The Obama deception, the people strike back.
[3:53:01.060 --> 3:53:03.740]  The phone rings and the questions are asked.
[3:53:03.740 --> 3:53:06.780]  I've been so sick, will the life change tea help me?
[3:53:06.780 --> 3:53:08.740]  Our answer is always the same.
[3:53:08.740 --> 3:53:14.900]  Yes, toxins and chemicals from food, water and air are attacking you this very moment.
[3:53:14.900 --> 3:53:20.740]  Fight back with our all-natural detoxifying tea that works immediately.
[3:53:20.740 --> 3:53:25.180]  Many companies use gimmicks and misleading free trials for their campaign.
[3:53:25.180 --> 3:53:26.660]  We use results.
[3:53:26.660 --> 3:53:31.380]  Life change tea's formula created by a PhD has been around for over 20 years.
[3:53:31.380 --> 3:53:35.940]  There are things happening in the world that are unseen and not healthy.
[3:53:35.940 --> 3:53:39.940]  The public has reached its all-time record for chronic sickness.
[3:53:39.940 --> 3:53:43.700]  This atrocity won't change unless you call us right now.
[3:53:43.700 --> 3:53:55.580]  Our number is 928-308-0408, again that's 928-308-0408 or you can order online at getthetea.com.
[3:53:55.580 --> 3:54:18.220]  Let's get the tea.com and remember we have the cheapest shipping in the industry.
[3:54:18.220 --> 3:54:23.540]  You know I meant to get to this days ago, Portugal, Switzerland, a bunch of other countries
[3:54:23.540 --> 3:54:28.380]  now won't accept U.S. customers, UBS and others because our government is stealing
[3:54:28.380 --> 3:54:29.380]  everybody's bank accounts.
[3:54:29.380 --> 3:54:33.060]  Then the big trillion dollar and billion dollar slush funds, those are all left alone.
[3:54:33.060 --> 3:54:39.620]  This is all part of the OECD, global tax avoidance, the total grid going in and we are known as
[3:54:39.620 --> 3:54:41.460]  the slave suckers of the planet.
[3:54:41.460 --> 3:54:46.420]  The Chinese and the American people are the different beta test, so are the Brits.
[3:54:46.420 --> 3:54:50.380]  Finishing up Gary, yeah Obama has lied about everything that was promised to set up youth
[3:54:50.380 --> 3:54:55.820]  course and he's keeping trips in Iraq, that's all a stage deal pulling some out of a few
[3:54:55.820 --> 3:54:59.740]  cities but very, very serious.
[3:54:59.740 --> 3:55:00.740]  Anything else?
[3:55:00.740 --> 3:55:05.820]  Just on a climate bill that just went through the house as a vote.
[3:55:05.820 --> 3:55:11.660]  After your show I watched the C-SPAN coverage of it and none of them, the Democrats didn't
[3:55:11.660 --> 3:55:14.980]  have a legitimate claim for this bill.
[3:55:14.980 --> 3:55:19.100]  Well of course they don't want to be legitimate, I appreciate your call.
[3:55:19.100 --> 3:55:23.980]  Yeah, the global climate situation, what's that all about Alan Watt?
[3:55:23.980 --> 3:55:29.340]  Again, it just prepares the propaganda, they don't even need facts, they hope to win just
[3:55:29.340 --> 3:55:34.500]  by the propaganda because average person cannot believe that so many people would go to such
[3:55:34.500 --> 3:55:38.820]  extreme lengths to lie to them, that that's how we think as ordinary people.
[3:55:38.820 --> 3:55:42.540]  Amber Hilger said the same thing, it's going to tell a lie, make sure it's a big lie, they're
[3:55:42.540 --> 3:55:46.780]  more likely to believe it and this is what they're using today, repetition, repetition,
[3:55:46.780 --> 3:55:54.260]  repetition, selective scientists who are all on IPPC and those scientists who come out with
[3:55:54.260 --> 3:55:59.100]  other facts, contradictory data are being barred from world meetings or even from getting
[3:55:59.100 --> 3:56:00.100]  talks.
[3:56:00.100 --> 3:56:07.980]  Hell, they're trying to make it illegal, climate denial, let's talk to Tatiana in California.
[3:56:07.980 --> 3:56:12.060]  Go ahead Tatiana, sorry I was calling you to Tanya, I was reading away across there.
[3:56:12.060 --> 3:56:17.700]  It's all right, people who make mistakes, Alex Hyde, I just wanted to thank you for
[3:56:17.700 --> 3:56:22.820]  what you're doing and I have actually a comment about one of your shows you did a few days
[3:56:22.820 --> 3:56:29.260]  ago on this federal offense, if somebody says something if you don't like they can actually
[3:56:29.260 --> 3:56:32.820]  sue you or whatever and my other question is...
[3:56:32.820 --> 3:56:37.580]  Don't let sue you arrest you, the cyber bullying and the hate crimes act, the hate crimes act
[3:56:37.580 --> 3:56:42.340]  has passed and it says if you hurt someone's feelings you're going to federal prison.
[3:56:42.340 --> 3:56:48.020]  Okay, well my other question is if it's a law, isn't it a double-edged sword, we can
[3:56:48.020 --> 3:56:49.340]  use that against them?
[3:56:49.340 --> 3:56:53.620]  No, no, it's all selectively enforced, it's all like when the cops beat a guy to death
[3:56:53.620 --> 3:57:01.180]  in England and it comes out they even killed him, they get awards, just like when the Army
[3:57:01.180 --> 3:57:04.140]  recruiters lie and say you'll go to prison if you don't join the military when you haven't
[3:57:04.140 --> 3:57:05.900]  signed, they get promoted.
[3:57:05.900 --> 3:57:07.740]  Alan, you want to explain that?
[3:57:07.740 --> 3:57:11.500]  Yes, that's the technique they're using, they make it sound as though everything's equal
[3:57:11.500 --> 3:57:16.260]  all get equal chances, but when you look at the United Nations, for instance, they decide
[3:57:16.260 --> 3:57:22.060]  which NGOs they will have on board and which ones they will not, which ones are taboo,
[3:57:22.060 --> 3:57:24.540]  so it's selective across the board.
[3:57:24.540 --> 3:57:29.620]  Yeah, that's like the United Nations Tatiana in Rwanda it came out, they really ran that
[3:57:29.620 --> 3:57:34.300]  mass murder, but then they run the trial punishing a few machete wielders.
[3:57:34.300 --> 3:57:38.900]  Do you have anything else Tatiana?
[3:57:38.900 --> 3:57:46.860]  Well, my question was, isn't it a double-edged sword, basically we can use the same law against
[3:57:46.860 --> 3:57:47.860]  them?
[3:57:47.860 --> 3:57:53.380]  No, no, because they decide how to apply it, selective enforcement, I appreciate your call,
[3:57:53.380 --> 3:57:57.700]  we're out of time for Jordan and others, always amazing having you on Alan Watt today for
[3:57:57.700 --> 3:58:03.580]  two hours and 15 minutes, cut into thematrix.com, our sites are PrismPlanet.com and infowars.com,

[3:58:09.780 --> 3:58:12.620]  Thanks, I appreciate being on.
[3:58:12.620 --> 3:58:17.780]  Let me say bye to you when the show ends my friend, okay, we are out of time here, ladies
