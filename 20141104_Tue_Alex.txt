[00:00.000 --> 00:13.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.080 --> 00:36.440]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:36.440 --> 00:43.040]  coming up today in election coverage this is the big day the midterms 2014
[00:43.040 --> 00:49.000]  what drudge tweeted three years ago 2014 is everything and I absolutely agree
[00:49.000 --> 00:53.240]  with him and now we're seeing how important it is as a major political
[00:53.240 --> 00:57.640]  realignment we've got Tucker Carlson joining us in the third hour and then
[00:57.640 --> 01:02.960]  we've got project Veritas director James O'Keefe an interview that Jakari
[01:02.960 --> 01:08.120]  Jackson just did that we're going to be premiering here on the radio today and
[01:08.120 --> 01:14.240]  then more of that interview tonight six o'clock central right through to midnight
[01:14.240 --> 01:19.000]  I'm going to be hosting with the rest of the reporters roundtable discussions
[01:19.000 --> 01:24.920]  interviews with people like Greg Palace James O'Keefe you name it we're going to
[01:24.920 --> 01:33.120]  have Joe Biggs down at the race between the abortion Queen Davis and the
[01:33.120 --> 01:36.880]  Republican she's running against so we're going to be covering it all but
[01:36.880 --> 01:42.760]  also looking at the news behind the news the story behind the story because it's
[01:42.760 --> 01:47.400]  going to be reality not delusion or illusion as Dr. Stan Montef always said
[01:47.400 --> 01:53.440]  it's going to save this country and save this Republic we have effectively shot
[01:53.440 --> 02:00.160]  down the political God they were trying to create a Barack Obama but they will
[02:00.160 --> 02:03.840]  simply give us new gods for old that's why it's important to hold the
[02:03.840 --> 02:09.320]  Republicans feet to the fire coming out of this election is they probably will
[02:09.320 --> 02:13.280]  get the Senate Washington Post is saying 90% chance that's what most of their
[02:13.280 --> 02:18.440]  analysts are saying right now but don't forget the secret weapon that's the
[02:18.440 --> 02:23.240]  illegal alien voters and I got to tell you I go around Austin other areas of
[02:23.240 --> 02:29.480]  Texas I actually don't mind seeing diverse crowds of people I think it's
[02:29.480 --> 02:37.240]  interesting except it's so overwhelming and it's so much faster than it was
[02:37.240 --> 02:44.440]  before and it's clearly organized and illegal I walked into a Walgreens at
[02:44.440 --> 02:51.440]  about eight o'clock last night and it was like something out of an
[02:51.440 --> 02:58.800]  international airport in Bangladesh there were people in Arab dress Indian
[02:58.800 --> 03:05.640]  dress there were folks obviously from Africa not speaking English and the
[03:05.640 --> 03:09.440]  people at the front counter barely spoke English and there were people
[03:09.440 --> 03:16.920]  clearly from Mexico in there and it just a total by design flooding of the
[03:16.920 --> 03:24.240]  country with illegals and the headline today is law enforcement defines
[03:24.240 --> 03:30.200]  elections as referendum says Obama's amnesty means tidal wave of illegal
[03:30.200 --> 03:36.840]  immigration listen here's the deal the Democrats are talking about a revolution
[03:36.840 --> 03:42.680]  the Democrats are talking about tearing the country apart if they're not given
[03:42.680 --> 03:46.800]  total amnesty and Illinois trying to pass a law that's unanimously passed out
[03:46.800 --> 03:51.120]  of the Senate and passed out of the house to let foreigners vote if you can
[03:51.120 --> 03:56.800]  get here you just can vote you understand that they can bring in an
[03:56.800 --> 04:01.720]  unlimited group and then have them vote as political clients for tax money
[04:01.720 --> 04:05.080]  they're given to do whatever the Democrats want and the Republicans are
[04:05.080 --> 04:08.160]  bought and paid for by the same globalist interest and they're going
[04:08.160 --> 04:14.760]  along with all this this is premeditated if India had the equivalent of
[04:14.760 --> 04:17.000]  hundreds of millions of people being brought in because they're more
[04:17.000 --> 04:21.520]  populist it would be the similar equation they bring in 40 50 million or
[04:21.520 --> 04:25.120]  300 million well India's a billions you bring in a couple hundred million
[04:25.120 --> 04:28.840]  imagine bringing a couple hundred million people say from China and then
[04:28.840 --> 04:32.400]  just saying you can vote in Indian elections Indians would burn their
[04:32.400 --> 04:37.640]  cities to the ground and quite frankly that's a normal instinct because you're
[04:37.640 --> 04:41.840]  being usurped you're being conquered you're being taken over no one would put
[04:41.840 --> 04:47.880]  up with stuff like this but here's the big enchilada Obama's already open the
[04:47.880 --> 04:53.000]  borders so this is political cover to say you better you know the illegals
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.920]  heckling him and stuff saying open the borders he already did it's all a

[09:07.000 --> 09:10.280]  first term in office the independent congressional budget office warning a
[09:10.280 --> 09:14.640]  new fiscal crisis is coming if Washington doesn't get it spending and
[09:14.640 --> 09:17.840]  check raising the debt ceiling which has done been done over a hundred times
[09:17.840 --> 09:23.960]  does not increase our debt if you've got a business that you didn't build that
[09:23.960 --> 09:46.000]  somebody else made that happen live from the info wars.com studios first Ebola is

[10:00.160 --> 10:06.520]  through the lies and disinformation it's Alex Jones you are either with the

[10:16.240 --> 10:23.760]  here live and we have a policy of truth here that is the name of our game that
[10:23.760 --> 10:30.200]  is our poll star our North Star there was a quote by George Washington I'll
[10:30.200 --> 10:34.840]  paraphrase it you guys could look it up but he said I have one goal in my life
[10:34.840 --> 10:40.160]  and one thing directs me and that is following the truth that is my destiny
[10:40.160 --> 10:44.480]  and that's what I'm looking for being true to myself true to those around me
[10:44.480 --> 10:48.880]  being honorable and being honorable means standing up against evil and not
[10:48.880 --> 10:54.440]  being a coward and telling the truth because that's what builds a better
[10:54.440 --> 10:58.720]  world and builds a better civilization thank you so much for joining us on
[10:58.720 --> 11:05.360]  election day 2014 and normally I don't get that excited about elections but
[11:05.360 --> 11:12.600]  2014 is everything as Matt Drudge said a few years ago in a tweet because the
[11:12.600 --> 11:16.760]  country is already in such shambles and is already on its knees to such an
[11:16.760 --> 11:22.200]  extent as being shut down by design so quickly that if we don't turn things
[11:22.200 --> 11:27.920]  around right now then we have to start going into modes of just not complying
[11:27.920 --> 11:32.000]  with the system at all and just trying to protect ourselves and digging in
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.840]  because this country is going third world 100% and you add to that the
[11:36.840 --> 11:40.800]  imperial nature of government and you add to that the largeness of government
[11:40.800 --> 11:45.720]  see wealthy free countries create so much tax money that it always grows a
[11:45.720 --> 11:51.200]  big government it's a 50-year cycle or so then that government becomes so giant
[11:51.200 --> 11:58.040]  it starts shutting down productivity but it doesn't stop eating once the wealth
[11:58.040 --> 12:03.960]  runs out it starts cannibalizing the society so we're following a very
[12:03.960 --> 12:14.960]  predictable historical geopolitical cultural path and you add to it massive
[12:14.960 --> 12:18.960]  population seven plus billion worldwide because these patterns aren't just
[12:18.960 --> 12:22.720]  happening here it's being repeated everywhere you add to it the spoiled
[12:22.720 --> 12:29.880]  rottenness of the general public on average the decadence people not
[12:29.880 --> 12:35.800]  appreciating what they've got even poor people on average in this country are
[12:35.800 --> 12:41.160]  rich compared to third world standards and they feel so entitled and so upset
[12:41.160 --> 12:46.440]  and so angry but I look at well-to-do people in nice restaurants and just how
[12:46.440 --> 12:51.920]  spoiled the women are and how bored they are and how unhappy they are and the
[12:51.920 --> 12:58.320]  statistics all bear that out this is a country clearly at every level rotting
[12:58.320 --> 13:06.440]  the essence of renaissance is enjoying productivity and science and
[13:06.440 --> 13:12.720]  technology and working with others and wanting to be honorable the essence of
[13:12.720 --> 13:18.160]  a declining empire is just decadence and a lackadaisical arrogant trendy
[13:18.160 --> 13:23.960]  attitude now there are still huge sectors of renaissance men and women
[13:23.960 --> 13:29.240]  working hard who enjoy life who work hard who play hard who have good sets of
[13:29.240 --> 13:36.480]  values and who are building good communities but sitting on top of that
[13:36.480 --> 13:44.240]  is corruption spiraling on a control and no one can deny that let me tell you
[13:44.240 --> 13:48.560]  what corruption is now we all knew this but there was that New York Times
[13:48.560 --> 13:56.960]  headline two weeks ago law allows IRS to take bank accounts without charging
[13:56.960 --> 14:02.520]  people I'm paraphrasing the headline and then you read the five-page article and
[14:02.520 --> 14:06.120]  it just lists all these innocent people there's the headline law lets IRS sees
[14:06.120 --> 14:11.600]  accounts on suspicion no crime required and you read it and they admit yes this
[14:11.600 --> 14:17.480]  woman had no criminal record yes she owned a small cafe for 40 years she
[14:17.480 --> 14:23.920]  deposited 300 to 500 to $600 a day in the bank where she thought it was safe so
[14:23.920 --> 14:30.200]  the IRS took her $33,000 life savings that was all she could prove there's a
[14:30.200 --> 14:34.440]  court case she could prove it was all after tax money she could prove that
[14:34.440 --> 14:39.400]  what was now in her account was was was that she'd paid taxes they don't care
[14:39.400 --> 14:46.000]  they said well we interpret the law that you made small deposits over a long
[14:46.000 --> 14:49.440]  period of time so it's fraud
[14:51.200 --> 14:56.080]  well what if you own a hot dog stand and never make more than $300 a day and
[14:56.080 --> 15:01.920]  half that's the cost of your food so you're making 150 bucks a day you work
[15:01.920 --> 15:07.800]  five six days a week you make me a thousand dollars a week you try to take
[15:07.800 --> 15:13.440]  care of your family and the government comes because I mean it's hot dog stands
[15:13.440 --> 15:19.080]  it's it's small bookstores it's mom and pops they don't want mom and pops
[15:19.080 --> 15:23.640]  Forbes magazine five years ago asked why is there a war on lemonade stands turns
[15:23.640 --> 15:27.440]  out the Justice Department's put out public memos they don't want commerce
[15:27.440 --> 15:31.160]  they can't totally surveil they're going to get rid of cash you're not gonna
[15:31.160 --> 15:35.080]  drive your own car everything's gonna be tracked and controlled Samsung came out
[15:35.080 --> 15:40.560]  announced what's already been going on for a decade microphones and cameras in
[15:40.560 --> 15:44.360]  the TVs watching and listening everything you do uploading it directly to
[15:44.360 --> 15:50.360]  the NSA with keyword software logging stuff that they flag to listen to it's
[15:50.360 --> 15:56.280]  being sold off yes if you tune in for the first time this show sounds crazy
[15:56.280 --> 16:01.200]  we're not crazy realities crazy before I get into election news look at this raw
[16:01.200 --> 16:09.640]  story basically White House connected you know disinfo platform Alex Jones
[16:09.640 --> 16:15.480]  Obama put out a green light close quote for close quote groups of black youths
[16:15.480 --> 16:20.680]  close quote to kidnap white women that is not what I said see when you read
[16:20.680 --> 16:26.000]  something like that with quotes after each word that's a straw man that's not
[16:26.000 --> 16:30.720]  what I said I said Obama and MSNBC created a racial climate where there's a
[16:30.720 --> 16:34.840]  green light to go out and attack white people just like there was a green light
[16:34.840 --> 16:39.800]  before it was decried and prosecuted for whites to go out groups of gangs and
[16:39.800 --> 16:44.360]  attack black people and I said black gangs all over the US attacking white
[16:44.360 --> 16:50.040]  people it's a well-known phenomenon all over local news around the country is the
[16:50.040 --> 16:56.080]  equivalent of people that well I'm not a I'm not a criminal but I do go roll you
[16:56.080 --> 17:02.720]  know gays that use another word and then because you don't like someone you go
[17:02.720 --> 17:06.960]  and two black guys two white guys whatever the case is it's done in all
[17:06.960 --> 17:12.360]  cultures go beat up some guys coming out of a gay bar that look like they're
[17:12.360 --> 17:17.840]  physically weak that's predator activity but it's okay because they're gay so
[17:17.840 --> 17:21.320]  you're allowed to physically attack them no you're not so it's wrong when the
[17:21.320 --> 17:25.880]  clan does it it's wrong when people go out and roll queers is what it's called
[17:25.880 --> 17:30.960]  and it's wrong when blacks go out and attack whites and here's the deal there
[17:30.960 --> 17:34.360]  is a green light and no one dare politically correct talk about it
[17:34.360 --> 17:41.760]  nationally but everybody knows and yes it was on the news that Max Cabrera that's
[17:41.760 --> 17:45.840]  done computer work for us for years as a contractor and his girlfriend got
[17:45.840 --> 17:50.000]  attacked by a group of four black males saying racial things to him and grabbing
[17:50.000 --> 17:54.840]  on her breast and it's on video yes it's true that Anthony Gutiarty had eight
[17:54.840 --> 17:58.440]  black guys pull a knife on him and start grabbing his girlfriend and calling
[17:58.440 --> 18:02.840]  racial names and threatening the stabbing in downtown Austin and it
[18:02.840 --> 18:08.160]  happened to me last Wednesday night on each six going to eat dinner they got
[18:08.160 --> 18:12.000]  some great restaurants over there and a big black guy comes up to me and goes
[18:12.000 --> 18:17.240]  I need money right now I gotta have it you understand I give it to me and I
[18:17.240 --> 18:25.320]  was like whoa and then we just stood there and he just stomped off this is
[18:25.320 --> 18:31.760]  going on just like in places like Vidar Texas if a black person goes to the
[18:31.760 --> 18:35.840]  town they get drugged behind a car to the till they're it's wrong it's wrong
[18:35.840 --> 18:41.360]  but what it is is it's criminals who are rationalizing doing what they're doing
[18:41.360 --> 18:47.560]  because you're black you're white you're gay and that's what I said in my speech
[18:47.560 --> 18:52.800]  not what you twisted and put in this article and that's why you people don't
[18:52.800 --> 18:57.000]  have any credibility it's why folks don't listen to you it's why the so-called
[18:57.000 --> 19:01.520]  left is falling apart because you're not the left okay you're a bunch of racial
[19:01.520 --> 19:10.440]  dividers okay 98% of black people I don't think are hardcore racist I think
[19:10.440 --> 19:15.840]  about 80% aren't racist period but I think 98% aren't hardcore racist but if
[19:15.840 --> 19:19.920]  you listen to a lot of hip-hop music the whole culture that's being pushed it is
[19:19.920 --> 19:26.120]  racial and I'm just calling it like I see it and that's a big no-no well here's
[19:26.120 --> 19:32.040]  the deal you don't control reality raw story and see it isn't some set narrative
[19:32.040 --> 19:35.680]  where I'm a Republican or I'm a Democrat or I'm pro-black or I'm anti-black I'm
[19:35.680 --> 19:40.120]  pro-human that's why I'm against creating race-specific bio weapons to use on
[19:40.120 --> 19:43.880]  black people or set up abortuaries all the black neighborhoods because I care
[19:43.880 --> 19:48.720]  about every person's soul and who they are as an individual not off what color
[19:48.720 --> 19:54.240]  they are but when groups are organizing to racially attack me because of what
[19:54.240 --> 19:58.360]  color I am I'm gonna speak out against it and I'm proud of it so keep writing

[26:40.760 --> 26:44.760]  think about all the massive news of electronic fraud going on for the
[26:44.760 --> 26:49.560]  Democrats mainly and of ballots being handed out to illegals and of James O
[26:49.560 --> 26:56.440]  Keith being able to go out and vote 20 times he got to the point of voting and
[26:56.440 --> 27:00.200]  then didn't commit the fraud but went and showed the fraud he'd say let me show
[27:00.200 --> 27:05.720]  you my ID oh no sir we don't want that you can go online get somebody's off the
[27:05.720 --> 27:09.200]  rolls who's known to have not voted in a long time it's all listed by the
[27:09.200 --> 27:14.640]  Democrats they put out list so you can go engage in fraud and then you dare
[27:14.640 --> 27:21.400]  try to show ID to show it's you that you registered this is identity theft you
[27:21.400 --> 27:26.960]  should want to have that proven and they say no only a couple states are
[27:26.960 --> 27:35.400]  demanding ID Texas is one of them and we're being sued it's outrageous to be
[27:35.400 --> 27:43.880]  usurped like this and to talk to the illegals and they openly say like in
[27:43.880 --> 27:49.720]  the video utopia they say we well we fled Central America because of socialism
[27:49.720 --> 27:54.480]  but we're up here basically to get some of the free stuff but you know socialism
[27:54.480 --> 27:58.480]  destroy your country I know but who can turn down free stuff and then they vote
[27:58.480 --> 28:02.840]  for Democrats who will take their guns and who think their kids belong to the
[28:02.840 --> 28:07.760]  state all because of short-term thinking and it's the lottery ticket mentality
[28:07.760 --> 28:11.280]  that isn't just in the third world it's here in America it's wherever there's
[28:11.280 --> 28:14.880]  ignorance wherever there's desperation wherever there's poverty wherever there's
[28:14.880 --> 28:20.840]  sewage running down the street wherever there's the end of prosperity people want
[28:20.840 --> 28:24.320]  the get-rich quick scheme

[28:39.240 --> 28:42.480]  really air the specials because it would just be exploit of the lie and say it
[28:42.480 --> 28:45.760]  helped them and then they run right back in an hour later and try to sell the
[28:45.760 --> 28:50.480]  suit to get even more money when we just given them a couple thousand dollars
[28:50.480 --> 28:54.040]  they're trying to go get them an apartment and then they won't even fill

[40:16.680 --> 40:21.360]  to bamboozle you and this is where it all really started Americans were the
[40:21.360 --> 40:26.400]  most untrusting of government the most inventions the most aggressive other
[40:26.400 --> 40:29.640]  foreign countries wrote about it the worst people to get in the fight with
[40:29.640 --> 40:33.400]  the worst people to mess with the best people to be in business with we were
[40:33.400 --> 40:38.520]  exceptional because whether you were Native American or a black person or a
[40:38.520 --> 40:46.560]  white immigrant or whoever you came from incredible wars and and conflict and
[40:46.560 --> 40:51.480]  you had to be tough and it was rough and and and people didn't play games and if
[40:51.480 --> 40:55.080]  you were rude to somebody they'd say hey apologize or I want to meet you in the
[40:55.080 --> 41:00.040]  street right now with swords you didn't you couldn't back down you want to run
[41:00.040 --> 41:07.480]  your mouth outside now or do you want you want to use pistols you just shot
[41:07.480 --> 41:11.880]  your mouth off see everybody thinks of the old
[41:11.880 --> 41:16.000]  westerns basically 1860s and 70s as where all that stuff went on that's when
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.760]  they popularized it and I'll meet you outside then nobody would get in
[41:18.760 --> 41:25.720]  trouble that was a duel but that got phased out by the 7 about 1880s where
[41:25.720 --> 41:31.280]  all the real duels went on was in New York in Boston and in Virginia and all
[41:31.280 --> 41:38.120]  over that area of the country there were duels every day in major cities can you
[41:38.120 --> 41:44.160]  imagine government treating someone rudely today when the government
[41:44.160 --> 41:49.320]  bureaucrat you'd say I challenge you slap you in the face come outside right
[41:49.320 --> 41:56.880]  now I'm gonna kill you see that's why people were so polite and it was the
[41:56.880 --> 42:00.560]  same thing in Europe and it was the same thing in ancient Japan you smarted
[42:00.560 --> 42:04.400]  off to somebody you better be ready to fight to the death not because people
[42:04.400 --> 42:08.360]  were looking for trouble people were very polite and very nice and we're all
[42:08.360 --> 42:12.280]  about their name and all about having the high road and let me tell you something
[42:12.280 --> 42:17.680]  successful quarters in business and in life that's what the people are like and
[42:17.680 --> 42:22.000]  there's still that America that has businesses and companies and industries
[42:22.000 --> 42:25.680]  and that's still there operating but getting almost none of the money it
[42:25.680 --> 42:30.240]  produces to reinvest so a lot of people are just turning off their factories
[42:30.240 --> 42:33.760]  turning off their companies they got enough family wealth to retire they're
[42:33.760 --> 42:37.280]  just disappearing or they're leaving the country they're moving to places that
[42:37.280 --> 42:44.360]  have more freedom so that's what's happening and and we are forgetting all
[42:44.360 --> 42:48.720]  those lessons and are acting like a nation of slaves I want to get into your
[42:48.720 --> 42:56.880]  phone calls at 800-25-99-231 I want to get into Justice Department dispatches
[42:56.880 --> 43:06.800]  poll monitors for election day but this happens almost every day on the street

[45:21.400 --> 45:26.160]  is life-changing Rob do in your own words repeat to me what you said this
[45:26.160 --> 45:29.440]  morning and what oxy powder did for you well I'll go into a little more detail
[45:29.440 --> 45:36.040]  back in September I started I decided I was gonna take it and I was I've been
[45:36.040 --> 45:40.480]  hovering between 220 and 215 couldn't get any lower than that you're a big guy
[45:40.480 --> 45:46.000]  what about 63 63 yeah and you know in college I was about 185 190 and I was
[45:46.000 --> 45:49.280]  playing basketball and doing all that stuff so and I was really in shape so
[45:49.280 --> 45:54.600]  I'd zero body fat you know could hike could do anything a lot of a lot of
[45:54.600 --> 45:58.640]  snowboarding but anyway over the years having kids you slow down a little bit
[45:58.640 --> 46:03.360]  so I was up to 220 I think the most I got to was 230 at one point I started to
[46:03.360 --> 46:08.600]  develop you know like a double chin and a bullfrog channel yeah one of my
[46:08.600 --> 46:12.240]  friends noticed and he's an older guy he's like 50s like and he calls me funky
[46:12.240 --> 46:15.920]  he goes funky you're getting getting a little big there and I hadn't really
[46:15.920 --> 46:18.840]  realized it and I looked in the mirror I'm like oh my god so I've been trying to
[46:18.840 --> 46:22.800]  watch what I eat by taking different things and you know but I was still like
[46:22.800 --> 46:26.840]  at 215 and when we started selling oxy powder I'm like you know what I'm gonna
[46:26.840 --> 46:31.160]  give it a try and I started off I did five pills the first night and nothing
[46:31.160 --> 46:34.920]  happened and they says on there you got to find your dose so the next night I
[46:34.920 --> 46:39.480]  did seven I woke up the next morning and it basically you're gonna be visiting
[46:39.480 --> 46:43.200]  the bathroom but it's not uncontrollable you can you're not gonna you know
[46:43.200 --> 46:47.480]  whatever you're not gonna mess yourself anywhere it's but it really does what I
[46:47.480 --> 46:50.600]  think it does is it goes in there and like liquefies the stuff that's inside
[46:50.600 --> 46:54.320]  your intestines and then it just flows out pretty much not to get too graphic
[46:54.320 --> 46:57.440]  but I did that for six days once I found that stuff's rotting in there and
[46:57.440 --> 47:01.000]  that's what gives you cancer exactly that it's diverticula and it gets rid of
[47:01.000 --> 47:04.200]  it hurts your immune system it does all kind of stuff it just it keeps your
[47:04.200 --> 47:08.960]  digestive system from working properly all that stuff in there so I did it for
[47:08.960 --> 47:12.640]  took it that first day and I took it for six more days after that and after that
[47:12.640 --> 47:19.080]  I was down to 202 and how fast did you lose 12 pounds it was in six seven
[47:19.080 --> 47:23.920]  days literally six seven you had 12 pounds of filth gone yeah and I was
[47:23.920 --> 47:26.960]  amazing I did that right before I went to the beach see I'm glad I have you'd
[47:26.960 --> 47:30.080]  say the stories I don't have to imagine the trolls getting close to me talking
[47:30.080 --> 47:36.120]  about yeah but you know it was I went to the beach in early October and I look
[47:36.120 --> 47:39.480]  my wife's like wow you look really good and I'm like I know I don't I guess it's
[47:39.480 --> 47:42.520]  this oxy powder I've been trying to get her to take it she's like well I don't
[47:42.520 --> 47:46.200]  know I said no you're gonna take it so you did all this stuff and it got some
[47:46.200 --> 47:49.120]  of the weight down but not the rest of the way well I mean for me it's all a
[47:49.120 --> 47:52.800]  synergy but I wish I'd have taken it years ago when they were in pecking me
[47:52.800 --> 47:57.000]  to take it yeah I mean I'm really 12 pounds melted off it less in about a
[47:57.000 --> 48:01.840]  week I'd say a week seven days and I've been able to keep it off to I'm I'm I've
[48:01.840 --> 48:05.720]  measured myself last night actually I'm like let's see what I'm at 202 how often
[48:05.720 --> 48:09.160]  do you take the ox powder now I haven't taken it since that one week time but I'm
[48:09.160 --> 48:13.320]  gonna take it probably after Thanksgiving I think that's so I think every three
[48:13.320 --> 48:17.920]  months I'm just gonna do how many pills made you lose 12 pounds well so you did
[48:17.920 --> 48:24.080]  seven for six days and five and then five the first day so seven times five
[48:24.080 --> 48:28.520]  35 plus five about 40 pills so it's not even not even a quarter of the bottle
[48:28.520 --> 48:33.400]  really how many pills are 120 yeah so literally like one bottle if you know I
[48:33.400 --> 48:37.160]  don't I don't take it every day I did it for that I did it intensely you and you
[48:37.160 --> 48:40.080]  really have to stick to it and by the third or fourth day you're like I don't
[48:40.080 --> 48:43.160]  know if I want to keep doing this if you just get through it it's not really
[48:43.160 --> 48:47.000]  that it's not bad at all considering the weight I lost I mean I could never lose
[48:47.000 --> 48:51.760]  the weight doing any other way you know that quickly well this is the final thing
[48:51.760 --> 48:55.360]  people Hollywood stars do to lose that final amount of weight yeah if you're

[53:54.120 --> 54:07.320]  remember before it's time to survive it's time to prepare
[54:24.120 --> 54:40.200]  if it's true the administration is hinting that after the midterms elections
[54:40.200 --> 54:45.640]  that we might delay or stop outright millions of deportations then it is
[54:45.640 --> 54:50.920]  possible that that those who have maybe on the land here running out here could
[54:50.920 --> 54:57.960]  be prevented from being deported here right correct and that is the larger
[54:57.960 --> 55:02.720]  issue that the president has already put out that there they have ordered all
[55:02.720 --> 55:08.720]  these green cards and work permits for post-election 10 plus million 20 plus
[55:08.720 --> 55:13.000]  million of these green cards to be able to issue to all these people when he's
[55:13.000 --> 55:19.520]  already announced his executive action so I've called on Congress please stop
[55:19.520 --> 55:25.720]  this president from unilaterally taking action powers that have I don't know why
[55:25.720 --> 55:29.080]  it would be in anyone interest so sure trying to give the benefit out if you
[55:29.080 --> 55:33.640]  know someone is a dangerous criminal or has anything from burglary to manslaughter
[55:33.640 --> 55:37.960]  on his or her rap sheet that why it would be in our interest to keep them
[55:37.960 --> 55:43.320]  here anyway what why would we do that well this is what Obama said these were
[55:43.320 --> 55:46.760]  the worst of the worst that even he wanted to deport let's stop right there
[55:46.760 --> 55:53.080]  that's a sheriff Babbo we've had on the broadcast before he's a really good guy
[55:53.080 --> 56:01.840]  they are releasing aggravated felons rapist arsonist armed robbers and if
[56:01.840 --> 56:06.000]  sheriff's call to have them picked up or even put at the database the Democratic
[56:06.000 --> 56:11.240]  Party shows up and protest and flips out that's like they have illegals going and
[56:11.240 --> 56:14.960]  protesting Obama but he's not doing enough he's gutted the border the border
[56:14.960 --> 56:19.320]  patrol gives them vouchers that go anywhere they want they've had high
[56:19.320 --> 56:22.840]  level border patrol go on the news and say we complete the smuggling process
[56:22.840 --> 56:29.240]  that's not enough see it's all about being over the top and so people say
[56:29.240 --> 56:33.800]  why is this happening people say why is this going on people say why would they
[56:33.800 --> 56:38.800]  do something like this because they are absolute total criminals taking the
[56:38.800 --> 56:42.920]  country down we're being conquered into a North American Union corporate

[1:01:31.160 --> 1:01:35.400]  day when I moved here from Russia only citizens could vote I couldn't vote so I
[1:01:35.400 --> 1:01:38.720]  had to wait till I became the United States citizen until I was eligible to
[1:01:38.720 --> 1:01:41.520]  receive a ballot now the Democrats just give you somebody that's off the you
[1:01:41.520 --> 1:01:44.400]  know that's still in the voter roll but hadn't voted in 10 years and you show up
[1:01:44.400 --> 1:01:48.600]  and just vote that's why it is yeah that would piss me off if someone used my
[1:01:48.600 --> 1:01:51.760]  name to go vote for some Democrat I'm not going to be voting you know Democrat

[1:08:42.840 --> 1:08:47.800]  election news as it unfolds and the Justice Department is dispatching
[1:08:47.800 --> 1:08:54.480]  monitors to 18 states to look for racism and people preventing minorities from
[1:08:54.480 --> 1:09:00.200]  voting no what's going on ladies and gentlemen is they're letting illegals
[1:09:00.200 --> 1:09:06.360]  vote without IDs with the voter rolls and it's a total takeover and that's
[1:09:06.360 --> 1:09:09.640]  what's happening and they've been caught red-handed and it's outrageous law
[1:09:09.640 --> 1:09:15.080]  enforcement defines elections as referendum Obama's amnesty means title
[1:09:15.080 --> 1:09:20.040]  wave of illegal immigration they've printed 60 million green cards for after
[1:09:20.040 --> 1:09:23.840]  the election they've already opened the borders they're just going to certify it
[1:09:23.840 --> 1:09:27.960]  all the government's got the organization facilities at thousands of
[1:09:27.960 --> 1:09:33.000]  apartment complexes organizing it preparing from all over the world used
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:35.960]  to we're always on my Latin America because that's the majority oh no Asia
[1:09:35.960 --> 1:09:45.600]  Eastern Europe Russia the Middle East Africa it just just it's just a flood
[1:09:45.600 --> 1:09:54.520]  an absolute flood and then huge government trough or memories milky's
[1:09:54.520 --> 1:10:02.080]  with taxpayer money it's just total robbery two wolves and a sheet voting on
[1:10:02.080 --> 1:10:06.920]  what's for dinner the problem with pure democracy is in in Greece they had pure
[1:10:06.920 --> 1:10:09.920]  democracy in some of the city states and they would have one bucket of black
[1:10:09.920 --> 1:10:15.760]  rocks and one bucket of white rocks and then the establishment higher class
[1:10:15.760 --> 1:10:19.560]  order was allowed to vote you'd be voted into their club that was the first
[1:10:19.560 --> 1:10:24.160]  democracy is more like an oligarchy and they would call them up and they would
[1:10:24.160 --> 1:10:28.080]  say yeah we think this philosopher has been rude to us we're gonna have a vote
[1:10:28.080 --> 1:10:32.520]  on throwing him off the cliff or sometimes we're gonna make him drink
[1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:37.320]  him lock these are real cases and then they would vote they say yep there are
[1:10:37.320 --> 1:10:44.160]  10 more black rocks then there are white rocks so we do not vote to kill you oh
[1:10:44.160 --> 1:10:48.240]  there are seven more white rocks and our black rocks those are a yes vote we're
[1:10:48.240 --> 1:10:52.120]  going to throw you off the cliff guards marching up to that thousand foot
[1:10:52.120 --> 1:10:58.800]  parapet and throw him off for corrupting the youth criticizing the
[1:10:58.800 --> 1:11:02.840]  government most of the philosophers that got killed and a large percentage of
[1:11:02.840 --> 1:11:07.360]  them did get killed the thinkers was for criticizing the state and they would
[1:11:07.360 --> 1:11:12.400]  either have you drink him lock or throw you off of a cliff and they would vote
[1:11:12.400 --> 1:11:17.000]  on that and that's pure democracy that's why it's the howl of democracy it's why
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:21.520]  in a republic you have the law the bill of rights that cannot be countermanded
[1:11:21.520 --> 1:11:28.640]  by a jury a grand jury a judge a president a mob anybody and now there
[1:11:28.640 --> 1:11:32.880]  is the trial of Socrates Socrates was ultimately sentenced to death by drinking
[1:11:32.880 --> 1:11:41.320]  hemlock based liquid then they had a vote and they gave him the hemlock and
[1:11:41.320 --> 1:11:48.160]  then he drank out out brief candle to quote Shakespeare okay let's go back to
[1:11:48.160 --> 1:11:51.760]  Vlad and then Jim Vlad finish your point about the parallels of living in Russia
[1:11:51.760 --> 1:11:56.520]  as a young person and then being here in the United States well my whole my whole
[1:11:56.520 --> 1:12:00.160]  point was the fact that people need to be citizens to vote and right now the
[1:12:00.160 --> 1:12:03.520]  democrats talk about voter ID laws or they shouldn't have voter ID laws where
[1:12:03.520 --> 1:12:06.920]  anyone should be able to just walk up and vote well what about my vote what if
[1:12:06.920 --> 1:12:10.720]  someone came and took my identity and went out and voted without an ID the
[1:12:10.720 --> 1:12:14.320]  reality is every single person that does vote they do need to provide physical
[1:12:14.320 --> 1:12:18.760]  government identification via passport or driver's license and it has to be
[1:12:18.760 --> 1:12:22.160]  some form of identification that was produced by the state ie you're
[1:12:22.160 --> 1:12:25.520]  something legitimate and if they're saying that oh we shouldn't have all
[1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:29.720]  these IDs for all these illegal immigrants they're basically implying
[1:12:29.720 --> 1:12:32.640]  that all the immigrants are stupid that they're not smart enough to go and get
[1:12:32.640 --> 1:12:35.880]  an ID to go become a citizen that's what they're saying so they're really the
[1:12:35.880 --> 1:12:39.120]  ones that are race and the reality is that if we don't turn around and remove
[1:12:39.120 --> 1:12:44.280]  all these that democrat or republican or even libertarian that break the law
[1:12:44.280 --> 1:12:48.720]  and reject the constitution well then end up like selling it so we at Russia
[1:12:48.720 --> 1:12:55.080]  well sure and it's also about a divide and conquer the old tower of Babel
[1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:59.080]  story where there were so many nationalities from so many countries that
[1:12:59.080 --> 1:13:02.760]  move there none of them could communicate anymore and and basically things fell
[1:13:02.760 --> 1:13:08.160]  apart it's one thing if you're in India and it's 95% Indians it's a culture you
[1:13:08.160 --> 1:13:12.160]  can adopt it you know what it is you're in China 90 some percent or Chinese you
[1:13:12.160 --> 1:13:16.080]  can adopt it you you can learn to navigate it or Mexico get on there
[1:13:16.080 --> 1:13:19.920]  ninety some percent of Mexican you can get it get into it I mean I like other
[1:13:19.920 --> 1:13:25.640]  cultures but when it becomes a Star Wars space bar like Walgreens was last night
[1:13:25.640 --> 1:13:28.640]  I mean I walked in this Walgreens and it was like
[1:13:28.640 --> 1:13:36.040]  Didi didi didi didi didi didi didi didi didi didi didi didi didi didi didi didi didi didi didi didi didi didi didi I mean it was
[1:13:36.040 --> 1:13:40.800]  like a gallery of every country in the world as I rounded the corner you know
[1:13:40.800 --> 1:13:45.680]  looking for children's Tylenol and getting some bottled water, some chapstick,
[1:13:46.400 --> 1:13:52.720]  and it was just that there is just bizarre and I see that everywhere now.
[1:13:54.320 --> 1:13:56.720]  I appreciate your call brother. I go down to the hiking bike trail
[1:13:58.080 --> 1:14:01.360]  and used to you'd see a few homeless people but the cops have run them off.
[1:14:01.360 --> 1:14:04.880]  I'll be two miles on a hiking bike trail where there's nobody and I'll come up on
[1:14:04.880 --> 1:14:11.920]  Guatemalans fishing with a tin can and yarn, with a grandmother sewing, with a fire going,
[1:14:11.920 --> 1:14:17.280]  and five kids. Grandma, dad, mom, five kids and you kind of, they're quaint, they're cute.
[1:14:18.480 --> 1:14:23.600]  I've been to Guatemala and I knew the hats, I knew they were Mayans. I said Guatemala,
[1:14:23.600 --> 1:14:28.640]  they're like sea, they're all scared. So in a way it's true, a lot of the immigrants don't know
[1:14:28.640 --> 1:14:33.920]  how to work the system. They're living on the hiking bike trail and fishing.
[1:14:37.840 --> 1:14:40.720]  And then I went, and I even, I've got video on my iPhone of them,
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:44.560]  but I didn't want to go up and just stick the camera on their face. I felt sorry for them,
[1:14:44.560 --> 1:14:47.600]  but see, the globalists are using the fact, hey, it's not my fault,
[1:14:47.600 --> 1:14:52.160]  Guatemala's collapsing and is a literal hellhole, is a hellhole.
[1:14:52.160 --> 1:15:01.600]  And they're being used as a weapon. But when you've got Guatemalans camping on the hiking
[1:15:01.600 --> 1:15:10.960]  bike trail in Austin, Texas, you got a problem. It's not just driving by Home Depot now that
[1:15:10.960 --> 1:15:15.520]  I'll see 50 to 100 illegals, at least they're out looking for work. There used to be 20,
[1:15:15.520 --> 1:15:20.640]  now it's 100. I just see it at gas stations and everywhere and there's huge buses everywhere now
[1:15:20.640 --> 1:15:24.960]  that you didn't see five years ago, just disgorging people from Central America. Folks,
[1:15:24.960 --> 1:15:29.040]  I'm here to tell you, I don't think it's 30 or 40 million. I think it might be like 100 million
[1:15:29.040 --> 1:15:34.240]  or something. Because I'm told all over the country, it's like this, just buses pull up and
[1:15:34.240 --> 1:15:39.440]  just offload people. And the board patrol gives them the money and it's just a staging ground.
[1:15:40.640 --> 1:15:44.480]  And we broke that three months ago, four months ago, before even the New York Times had to admit
[1:15:44.480 --> 1:15:48.320]  it a month later. The board patrol said, come down here, do you want to see something come here
[1:15:48.320 --> 1:15:53.120]  at night? And they were all the scores of buses driving in and people get off, the board patrol
[1:15:53.120 --> 1:15:57.200]  gives them the voucher, they get on, the board patrol stands there with their mouth hanging open
[1:15:57.200 --> 1:16:02.560]  and the buses just drive in to democratic party facilities, major churches, and then they deploy
[1:16:02.560 --> 1:16:06.720]  them from there, they sign them up for welfare, sign them up for free housing, and then those
[1:16:06.720 --> 1:16:11.440]  become command bases to then harbor the next group and complete the smuggling process.
[1:16:13.200 --> 1:16:17.600]  This is a communist takeover by offshore banks that want to put us under communism, they're exempt.
[1:16:17.600 --> 1:16:22.400]  This is the end of America. Just so you know, it's the equivalent of taking a straight razor
[1:16:22.400 --> 1:16:26.480]  right across somebody's neck and slicing both carotids, both jugulars, just
[1:16:29.280 --> 1:16:34.960]  pumping blood out. Because if they brought these immigrants in by 100 million and they all had to
[1:16:34.960 --> 1:16:39.600]  work and weren't put on the political system, it probably ended up making the country wealthier
[1:16:39.600 --> 1:16:44.000]  down the road. Because Americans, whether black, white, or Hispanic, don't have kids anymore once
[1:16:44.000 --> 1:16:48.880]  their citizens have like 1.5 kids. So, you know, we are a dead country, so we got to have replacement
[1:16:48.880 --> 1:16:53.760]  rates, but not 100 million. I mean, it's just, I could walk out of here and walk 100 yards,
[1:16:53.760 --> 1:16:57.440]  they'll just be illegals walking around. I mean, it's just everywhere. I don't care where you are,
[1:16:57.440 --> 1:17:03.520]  you can be in the middle of nowhere. And the illegals are just running around. And again,
[1:17:03.520 --> 1:17:08.640]  it's all being done while citizens are held with the highest nitpicking standard. You got to tell
[1:17:08.640 --> 1:17:14.480]  light out, your insurance is out. I'm bankrupt, man. I can't pay for it anymore. Get out of the car, going to jail, CPS those kids.
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:20.240]  Because you're a citizen, you're a mark, you're a chump, you're to be ridden down,
[1:17:20.240 --> 1:17:23.760]  you're the enemy, you're known as the right whale, the right one to hunt.
[1:17:24.800 --> 1:17:29.200]  Print me a Wikipedia on the right whale, please. Reverend Bolt, thanks for holding.
[1:17:29.200 --> 1:17:32.480]  Then we'll go to Robert, Kristen, Will, and others. Go ahead.
[1:17:32.480 --> 1:17:39.200]  Yes, good afternoon. I'm calling from the great Republic of Texas.
[1:17:40.160 --> 1:17:44.960]  Well, welcome, terrorists. You know full well, it's FEMA Region 6 racist,
[1:17:44.960 --> 1:17:50.320]  and the unlected FEMA governor is in command. You submit to the governor, don't you?
[1:17:51.440 --> 1:17:54.880]  Oh, yes. Do you even know who the governor of FEMA Region 6 is?
[1:17:56.720 --> 1:17:58.800]  Actually, no. Why don't you look it up?
[1:17:58.800 --> 1:18:04.000]  Do you know Obama? No, it's a Fort Hood general, but you will learn to submit soon enough.
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:11.600]  The shadow governor of FEMA Region 9 is Herr Napolitano, your ruler. Sorry, go ahead.
[1:18:12.400 --> 1:18:18.880]  Yes. The two things. One, several months back, I started taking your Mason,
[1:18:18.880 --> 1:18:27.200]  Ilionine, and your SuperMail. And prior to this, I was barely walking using him to use a walker.
[1:18:27.200 --> 1:18:34.160]  Now, I'm able to function as a human again, actually move around, enjoy life.
[1:18:35.200 --> 1:18:39.360]  Needless to say, it does wonders. Well, thank you, brother. You know,
[1:18:39.360 --> 1:18:44.400]  we don't ask the callers to call these testimonials. In fact, it's almost becoming an issue, but thank
[1:18:44.400 --> 1:18:48.240]  you. They really are. If you have an eye and eye deficiency and you don't get enough of it,
[1:18:48.240 --> 1:18:52.480]  you'll end up dying of a complication. That's just a fact. But they don't tell you that. They don't
[1:18:52.480 --> 1:18:58.960]  tell you that they put estrogen mimickers in and basically everything, print paper, everything,
[1:18:58.960 --> 1:19:03.280]  to where males are suppressed. So you go on something like SuperMail. That just makes you
[1:19:03.280 --> 1:19:08.960]  what you're supposed to feel like. Sorry, I'm ranting. Oh, that's okay. Works for me.
[1:19:09.920 --> 1:19:17.360]  Yeah. I went up, did my voting this morning. It is funny because I've talked with a lot of people,
[1:19:17.360 --> 1:19:22.880]  college-aid students in the past couple of days, and I'd say better than 80% that I've spoken with.
[1:19:23.680 --> 1:19:28.960]  They're all so complacent and dumbed down. There's the old adage, you can't pick stupid.
[1:19:29.920 --> 1:19:32.640]  And just because they're getting an education doesn't mean they're...
[1:19:33.200 --> 1:19:39.360]  You're right. I've got to be honest. Young people working in a shop are super smart.
[1:19:40.400 --> 1:19:45.760]  And then I go down to UT and we do these interviews. We can't find people that can talk.
[1:19:45.760 --> 1:19:50.720]  I mean, they aren't humans anymore. They just look at their iPads and just go,
[1:19:50.720 --> 1:19:54.880]  trendy, trendy, trendy. They aren't even people anymore. I'm sorry. Go ahead.
[1:19:55.600 --> 1:20:01.600]  Exactly. And with them, they're not voting. Oh, we're not going to vote. Why not? Why?
[1:20:02.560 --> 1:20:06.640]  I vote don't count. Well, naturally, if you don't vote, it don't count.
[1:20:07.440 --> 1:20:11.360]  Well, voting's only one part of an overall plan. You're always in a fight for freedom.
[1:20:11.360 --> 1:20:15.200]  It's not perfect. A lot of people we get on say don't vote. I can see their perspective.
[1:20:15.200 --> 1:20:19.120]  Vote with your dollars. Vote was not complying. There's a hundred ways to vote.
[1:20:19.760 --> 1:20:24.720]  There's more than a hundred ways, but voting is a big one. And yes, it usually doesn't matter when
[1:20:24.720 --> 1:20:29.200]  they own both parties, but that's wearing thin. It's coming to the end of it. God bless you,
[1:20:29.200 --> 1:20:33.440]  Reverend Bolt. Let's talk to Robert in Florida. We just skipped the network break. Robert,
[1:20:33.440 --> 1:20:39.760]  you're on the air worldwide. Hello, Alex. Long time listener and trying to be a caller.
[1:20:40.320 --> 1:20:43.520]  Well, welcome to the airways. Thank you, sir. Thank you very much.
[1:20:43.520 --> 1:20:47.920]  I've been listening to you for about four or five years now. I went in and voted today for
[1:20:47.920 --> 1:20:52.320]  what good it's worth. And I live in a little town called Port St. Lucie, Florida, just on the
[1:20:52.320 --> 1:20:58.320]  East Coast, north of West Palm. And when I went in there, just out of curiosity, and I don't get
[1:20:58.320 --> 1:21:03.680]  me wrong, I don't have a problem with the ID thing. And I even had my ID up. But when I went in there,
[1:21:03.680 --> 1:21:08.880]  I asked them, I said, they said, okay, we need to see your driver's license. I said, okay,
[1:21:08.880 --> 1:21:13.440]  can you show me the Florida law that says, you know, you have to have it. And he says, well,
[1:21:13.440 --> 1:21:17.600]  I don't know the law, but the law is, you know, you can't vote here unless you have a photo form
[1:21:17.600 --> 1:21:23.520]  of ID. And he, my guidelines are, and I interrupted him. I said, well, your guidelines do not supersede
[1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:28.800]  a law. I said, if I was right, it's important to train everybody that you're going to show me the
[1:21:28.800 --> 1:21:33.360]  law and you're going to be specific about it so that these people start learning to actually
[1:21:33.360 --> 1:21:38.240]  look at the law. You're right. Right. And when I, and then I said, well, if I was a piece of Spanish,
[1:21:38.240 --> 1:21:43.680]  you legal scum that come over here, would I have to show you ID or anything? And his jaw kind of
[1:21:43.680 --> 1:21:47.600]  dropped. And the ladies that were sitting, sitting there listening to all this, they kind of smiled
[1:21:47.600 --> 1:21:51.840]  that, you know, we, I agree with you. And, but this doesn't happen here. He says, in this precinct,
[1:21:51.840 --> 1:21:56.880]  you have to have an ID. And he, he stepped away and he brought back a paper. They had the Florida
[1:21:56.880 --> 1:22:01.920]  statute that did say you have to have ID. But one of the things were, if you don't have a photo ID,
[1:22:01.920 --> 1:22:07.920]  you have to use a piece of mail, something with your address on a credit card. So that does,
[1:22:07.920 --> 1:22:14.240]  that doesn't really, you know, justifies ID in my book. If you can use a piece of mail that, you
[1:22:14.240 --> 1:22:19.120]  know, that's right. Florida's like Texas, where you just think they want something. And that's
[1:22:19.120 --> 1:22:24.800]  meant to stop the serial vote fraud, where James O'Keeffe could vote 20 times. He didn't actually
[1:22:24.800 --> 1:22:28.960]  vote, but he got to the point of getting the ballot to illustrate it. And by the way, we have a
[1:22:28.960 --> 1:22:34.720]  piece of the interview that Jacari Jackson just did with O'Keeffe, exclusive with all the big
[1:22:34.720 --> 1:22:39.200]  election fraud he's breaking. We have the full interviews tonight. During live coverage, we've
[1:22:39.200 --> 1:22:44.960]  got some other interviews we've taped with Greg Palast and others. That's coming up tonight,
[1:22:44.960 --> 1:22:55.440]  six to midnight central, seven to one a.m. Eastern. That's three to, I guess, that'd be nine Pacific
[1:22:56.240 --> 1:23:01.920]  info wars.com forward slash show or click on the elections link to find the free video feed.
[1:23:01.920 --> 1:23:06.000]  That's already up and going right now. Shyamal casting this transmission. I appreciate your call.
[1:23:07.200 --> 1:23:10.960]  Now, I get your point saying that you're mad at people that are here illegally,
[1:23:11.920 --> 1:23:15.840]  voting to disenfranchise you illegally calling them scum. I think if you call someone scum
[1:23:15.840 --> 1:23:19.920]  who's voting illegally, if I was down in Mexico illegally voting on their elections, I think
[1:23:19.920 --> 1:23:26.240]  they could call me scum. But if you mean they're scum because they're Spanish speaking, I gotta
[1:23:26.240 --> 1:23:33.840]  be honest with you, people that are here legally that I know from Latin America are more moral and
[1:23:33.840 --> 1:23:38.640]  nicer than Americans just because they're more old fashioned. Americans are so incredibly spoiled.
[1:23:41.520 --> 1:23:46.960]  There is a cliche that sold conservatives on having open borders that the illegals will work hard and
[1:23:46.960 --> 1:23:53.760]  they will. But that culture is being phased out and they want people that wear six X underwear
[1:23:53.760 --> 1:23:58.880]  that are on welfare to get up here who can barely get in a bus ride. They're advertising,
[1:23:58.880 --> 1:24:02.720]  want to have a baby? That's who they want up here. In my view,
[1:24:06.720 --> 1:24:10.560]  well, you know, I told the story about I ran out of gas the other day and I think the guy
[1:24:10.560 --> 1:24:15.840]  said he was from El Salvador. I forget really nice. I'm walking down the ramp, ran out on 290
[1:24:15.840 --> 1:24:23.520]  and he took me to get gas. And when I came back, the cops were there saying, hey,
[1:24:24.240 --> 1:24:27.920]  you can't, this is blocking the exit ramp. I go, I know, I didn't want to run out here,
[1:24:27.920 --> 1:24:30.960]  wasn't blocking, I was able to pull it over. And then the cops basically ended up,
[1:24:31.600 --> 1:24:35.520]  because of course the gas can at the place didn't go in the hole, right? Because it's the type of
[1:24:35.520 --> 1:24:40.240]  seal and the cops just pushed the truck down over the hill and down to the gas station. So they
[1:24:40.240 --> 1:24:44.800]  were very nice and did service duty. It's not lowly to do service. It's a high calling.
[1:24:44.800 --> 1:24:48.640]  You know, it's, it's good to help people. It's good to be a good severity and do your job.
[1:24:49.200 --> 1:24:52.560]  But I mean, I had a good experience with the police and with the guy and I said,
[1:24:52.560 --> 1:24:57.680]  are you here legally? And the guy was like, no, you didn't speak much English, but he was pulling
[1:24:57.680 --> 1:25:05.280]  over to, you know, help me and give me a ride. Look, I mean, I'll take anybody over the UT
[1:25:05.280 --> 1:25:09.840]  students I've seen and I'm not trying to be mean. I don't care if they're Chinese, white, black,
[1:25:09.840 --> 1:25:16.320]  we go interview them. They are so stupid and can hardly talk, but they know all the trendy buzzwords.
[1:25:18.000 --> 1:25:22.480]  We go down there and nine out of 10 sign a petition to ban water and they brag, yeah,
[1:25:22.480 --> 1:25:27.040]  I'm a chemist. You know, I got a degree from Stanford. Yeah. The guy starts hitting on Lee
[1:25:27.040 --> 1:25:32.000]  and McAdoo on the, on the jogging trail and he's bragging that he's got a degree in chemistry.
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:35.840]  And he's saying, yes, I'll sign your petition to ban the hydrogen monoxide. The hydrogen
[1:25:35.840 --> 1:25:42.880]  monoxide is the scientific name of water, H2O. Nine out of 10 people, we've done it. Well, you
[1:25:42.880 --> 1:25:45.840]  go up and say, you know, it's very bad for the environment, want to restrict it, want to arrest
[1:25:45.840 --> 1:25:53.280]  anybody caught dumping it on the street in the wintertime just to give them a hint. Sodium chloride
[1:25:53.280 --> 1:25:58.400]  is just, it's incredible. Can burn your eyes, burn your skin. Oh, yeah, I want to ban that. It's
[1:25:58.400 --> 1:26:04.960]  table salt, ladies and gentlemen. And I'm not a chemist. It's just who, what's wrong with these
[1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:09.200]  people? Oh, they know how to run their channel remote though. They know how to laugh when I warn
[1:26:09.200 --> 1:26:13.440]  them that the TV's listening to every word they say on record, patented, certified, hooked up.
[1:26:14.480 --> 1:26:18.720]  I'm going to go back to your calls in a moment. The first really serious death threats I got
[1:26:23.760 --> 1:26:27.760]  were when, in fact, if I told the whole story, people wouldn't believe it. It's like a novel
[1:26:27.760 --> 1:26:36.240]  is that an engineer came to me in the parking lot of access television and said, here's the new digital
[1:26:36.240 --> 1:26:40.320]  cable box is coming out in a year. We're integrating them and testing them. It was a high level engineer.
[1:26:42.800 --> 1:26:47.040]  Well, it's been so long ago, I could just say it because they ended up fine. He was the lead engineer
[1:26:47.920 --> 1:26:53.840]  at a major cable company in Austin, the town that was only one. And he goes, there's a microphone in
[1:26:53.840 --> 1:26:59.600]  it that's voice print. And this next one's coming out is going to have a camera. And they go, these
[1:26:59.600 --> 1:27:03.680]  functions won't work for years, but we're hooking them up and activating them. And we can see in
[1:27:03.680 --> 1:27:08.800]  the test homes that the data is being sucked out through government conduits that have been added
[1:27:08.800 --> 1:27:13.600]  to our facility. I went on air and said, they got NSA hubs hooked into your digital cable boxes.
[1:27:13.600 --> 1:27:21.680]  I'm like 97. And they are tracking what everybody's doing in live time. And these are going to roll
[1:27:21.680 --> 1:27:26.400]  out everywhere. Part of a smart grid. And the NSA has hubs and all the telecoms. So I already talked
[1:27:26.400 --> 1:27:32.560]  to an AT&T guy about this too. You notice later was an AT&T person in San Francisco. The head guy,
[1:27:32.560 --> 1:27:37.360]  the head engineer over the whole building went public and said, no, whole floors are NSA.
[1:27:40.800 --> 1:27:45.440]  30 minutes into the transmission, they cut the feed at Time Warner Master Control because
[1:27:45.440 --> 1:27:50.400]  access TV ran through that. The phone starts ringing and they call me and they go, we're getting
[1:27:50.400 --> 1:27:54.480]  major heat. You need to, we're being threatened by Time Warner that you're giving out proprietary
[1:27:54.480 --> 1:27:59.840]  information. They may sue us. And I said, listen, they, and so I brought in a cable box. We got
[1:27:59.840 --> 1:28:04.960]  to find these videos. They're so epic and ripped it open on air and showed the microphone and the
[1:28:04.960 --> 1:28:09.520]  blueprints. This is the type of shows I used to do back then by myself. Buckley used to help
[1:28:10.320 --> 1:28:18.080]  when he, when he could. And Mike Hanson, I tore it open on air, tore it open on air
[1:28:18.080 --> 1:28:24.880]  and showed everybody. And man, the death threats started. And, and I mean, I get these calls on
[1:28:24.880 --> 1:28:29.920]  my unlisted line going, listen, Alex, you can have fun and have your show. But let me tell you,
[1:28:29.920 --> 1:28:35.840]  you gone too far, buddy. You don't talk about that cable box. You little son of a bitch or you and
[1:28:35.840 --> 1:28:40.400]  your family are going to get it. And I'm sorry to talk like that, but I mean, serious old men
[1:28:40.400 --> 1:28:44.960]  can sound really evil. Always real friendly. Imagine when they call up and go, listen, you little
[1:28:44.960 --> 1:28:50.000]  pizza, you got into stuff you're not supposed to be getting into, boy. And if you know it's good
[1:28:50.000 --> 1:28:56.640]  for you, you'll shut your mouth right now. Same day when I exposed, exposed Dinecore and the
[1:28:56.640 --> 1:29:01.840]  child kidnapping rings that were in the news that the same kind of calls and stuff you wouldn't believe.
[1:29:02.800 --> 1:29:06.480]  It was causing credible hell for my family, but somebody's got to expose this.
[1:29:08.720 --> 1:29:13.040]  People calling up saying, I just saw you let your dog out in the backyard. That's a nice little dog.
[1:29:13.040 --> 1:29:16.720]  I mean, the phone rings right as you close the door. Yeah, I heard your dad's in the hospital,
[1:29:16.720 --> 1:29:27.680]  Hopi effin dies. We're going to cut your head off. You understand that? We're going to cut your effing
[1:29:27.680 --> 1:29:32.480]  head off. See, that's who runs this country. They ship in the narcotics, they run the kids,
[1:29:32.480 --> 1:29:37.680]  they run it all, and they count on us being weak-minded while they got cable boxes,
[1:29:37.680 --> 1:29:47.920]  listen to everything we do for 15, 16, 17 years. Did it stop 9-11? No, they run Al-Qaeda.
[1:29:47.920 --> 1:29:55.360]  It's not our government. We're on the march, the empire's on the run, Alex Jones and the GCN radio
[1:29:55.360 --> 1:30:04.880]  network. Using unparalleled research in the development of a synergistic formulation based

[1:30:15.680 --> 1:30:20.320]  was invented during Dr. Group's research on the toxification of our bodies. Many herbal
[1:30:20.320 --> 1:30:25.680]  colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially dangerous ingredients,
[1:30:25.680 --> 1:30:31.200]  oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse. Gently start cleaning your
[1:30:31.200 --> 1:30:36.640]  body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep. Oxy powder does not require time off
[1:30:36.640 --> 1:30:42.000]  work, and there's no need for bad taste and concoctions. Instead, oxy powder slowly releases
[1:30:42.000 --> 1:30:47.840]  monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body. Experience the astonishing cleansing power
[1:30:47.840 --> 1:30:54.720]  of superoxide and ozonide technology. Go to infowarslife.com or infowarsstore.com to get

[1:33:53.520 --> 1:33:57.520]  And it's been a few weeks since I took any oxy powder. So I've decided,
[1:33:57.520 --> 1:34:03.680]  hearing Rob do a story earlier about losing 12 pounds of stuff in his gut in seven days.
[1:34:04.480 --> 1:34:10.640]  He lost 12 pounds a month or so ago. He told that story last hour.
[1:34:10.640 --> 1:34:18.160]  So I'm going to take some oxy powder right now as well, infowarslife.com.
[1:34:18.800 --> 1:34:23.520]  I'm going to have it with my uromante tea. Oh, and yeah, let me put a little bit of a
[1:34:23.520 --> 1:34:29.920]  super male vitality in there. I need to get some new bottles. These are getting low.
[1:34:31.120 --> 1:34:37.440]  A little bit of survival shield. Nation iodine X2. Since it's pure iodine, it doesn't taste bad
[1:34:37.440 --> 1:34:42.400]  like the other stuff that's out there that's bound with the alcohol and isn't real nation iodine.
[1:34:44.480 --> 1:34:47.040]  And then Bon Appetit. Going to take my oxy powder
[1:34:49.920 --> 1:34:50.880]  by DNA Force
[1:34:54.480 --> 1:34:55.280]  before I eat lunch.
[1:34:55.280 --> 1:35:05.040]  And I just take oxy powder for a day or two every couple of weeks. This is basic maintenance.

[1:36:40.640 --> 1:36:45.600]  there. The listeners. So God bless you. We salute you. Now I'm going to shut up like I did with Steve
[1:36:45.600 --> 1:36:49.680]  Quell last week for the last half of the hour. I did a pretty good job. Probably talked a minute
[1:36:49.680 --> 1:36:54.480]  or two in the next 25 minutes. I'm going to just go to your calls, hear your comment and briefly
[1:36:54.480 --> 1:36:58.640]  try to answer any questions you have so we get to a lot of callers. Christine in Minnesota,
[1:36:58.640 --> 1:37:05.600]  thanks for calling. You're on the air. Hi, I wanted to mention that I believe I'm kind of the of the
[1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:12.800]  mindset of Jesse Ventura when he comes to the voting situation about not going for the right
[1:37:12.800 --> 1:37:19.440]  left paradigm like you've talked about for years. I really think that it's about us having a voice
[1:37:19.440 --> 1:37:26.080]  even if we don't believe in the system in the voting. If you go there and you vote by your
[1:37:26.080 --> 1:37:33.680]  conscience like Joe Skellen mentioned, I think a lot of us do not or in society don't think with
[1:37:33.680 --> 1:37:40.000]  our conscience the way we should and vote. What we really believe in, it's all about going well,
[1:37:40.000 --> 1:37:45.920]  Republican, Democrat, whatever, but it's also about still showing them that we have a voice
[1:37:45.920 --> 1:37:52.240]  even though I myself am discouraged with the system, the voting system altogether. So
[1:37:53.280 --> 1:37:58.240]  Well, I agree with you. Look, it's a mix of things. People say either don't vote or only vote third
[1:37:58.240 --> 1:38:03.200]  party or look, if you know there's a really good Tea Party Libertarian candidate in the
[1:38:03.200 --> 1:38:07.360]  Republican Party that the systems after who has a chance at winning as you get behind them vote
[1:38:07.360 --> 1:38:12.160]  for them. Or if you've got a chance to run for school board, even if you don't win, you'll educate
[1:38:12.160 --> 1:38:21.280]  people and inject real issues. I mean, I tried to get a radio job for two years before I got one.
[1:38:21.840 --> 1:38:25.600]  And then I went, wait, why am I watching access television? I'll just go show what I can do on
[1:38:25.600 --> 1:38:31.040]  access television. Use that to learn how to film make. I just wanted to tell people what was going
[1:38:31.040 --> 1:38:35.680]  on. So I'd use any venue I could. And that's why they've had so many trade publications say that
[1:38:35.680 --> 1:38:41.280]  I have pioneered so much of how to build a true independent media operation that can challenge
[1:38:41.280 --> 1:38:49.280]  the establishment because necessity is the mother of invention. And so vote for third party when
[1:38:49.280 --> 1:38:54.160]  they're good. Vote for a Democrat if they're good. Sometimes there's some of those out there.
[1:38:54.160 --> 1:38:58.160]  Surprisingly, that's why Bill Gates and Warren Buffett, others are lining up against some of
[1:38:58.160 --> 1:39:03.200]  them. Vote for Republicans. But right now in this midterm election, it's all about Republican versus
[1:39:03.200 --> 1:39:09.600]  Democrats. It's about repudiating Obama. It's about scaring the globalist off. It's about not
[1:39:09.600 --> 1:39:15.120]  letting them officially legalize the 50 million, 100 million, whatever it is. I mean, I'm not joking,
[1:39:15.120 --> 1:39:20.240]  folks. It's wall to wall illegals everywhere from everywhere. Just I mean, you name it, just they're
[1:39:20.240 --> 1:39:24.240]  here. And it's all third world countries because people from other countries don't want to come
[1:39:24.240 --> 1:39:28.480]  here. We're like a third world country now. That's another thing. Being a third world country runs
[1:39:28.480 --> 1:39:34.560]  off all the good people from Africa and Asia and Eastern Europe and Europe and Latin America.
[1:39:35.760 --> 1:39:40.320]  One nice part about Austin and San Antonio is we got all the rich Latin Americans. So that's good
[1:39:40.320 --> 1:39:45.200]  for business. They collapse their countries. They all ran up here. They got money. They're nice.
[1:39:46.080 --> 1:39:51.680]  I care less. They got brown skin and, you know, speak Spanish. They got money and they're nice.
[1:39:51.680 --> 1:39:57.280]  I like them. But let me tell you, I don't want a bunch of poor people from a collapsed,
[1:39:57.280 --> 1:40:02.320]  you know, Eastern Europe or Asia or Latin America, Guatemala, who will go right into the system and
[1:40:02.320 --> 1:40:08.240]  go right along with communism. I appreciate your call. Great points. Tim in Oregon, you're on the
[1:40:08.240 --> 1:40:14.000]  year. Welcome. Alex Jones. Thanks, man. Hey, man, I really liked that comic release you were doing
[1:40:14.000 --> 1:40:21.040]  earlier with the Barack Obama. Let's play it one more time. Hold on. Jamie Foxx one more time.
[1:40:21.040 --> 1:40:28.720]  I mean, he when he just says the name, it's like he's, he said Shazam or, or open sesame or super
[1:40:28.720 --> 1:40:34.400]  kinds of fragilistic expialidocious. I mean, he's speaking the power word that, that, that,
[1:40:34.400 --> 1:40:41.520]  that like God used in his words to open up and create reality that this is the, the fire of
[1:40:41.520 --> 1:40:51.520]  Prometheus, the ultimate elixir of truth, the name of Zeus writ large Barack Obama.
[1:40:51.520 --> 1:40:59.760]  Barack Obama. Oh, this is to play the whole thing. Barack Obama. Oh, yeah. First of all,
[1:40:59.760 --> 1:41:11.680]  give an honor to God and our Lord and savior, Barack Obama. Yeah. Yeah. Give it to Barack Obama.
[1:41:11.680 --> 1:41:21.040]  Yeah. Yeah. Oh, Farmer, Nixon, insider, tea party, the stronger Republican party.
[1:41:21.040 --> 1:41:26.080]  That's right. We need to, we need to be nicer and tell a billion people come here and vote
[1:41:26.080 --> 1:41:30.880]  to take our guns. I love Rand Paul, but he's got advisors telling him, we need to be more
[1:41:30.880 --> 1:41:34.880]  hip and with the young people and, you know, let foreigners like us. Well, it's, it's already
[1:41:34.880 --> 1:41:39.520]  checkmate. You're bringing unlimited foreigners, Rand Paul. They're going to vote for the commies.
[1:41:39.520 --> 1:41:44.320]  They ain't voting for you. It's checkmate. Don't you get it?
[1:41:47.120 --> 1:41:52.640]  But I was talking about the, you know, the, the voting thing, you know, and up here in Oregon,
[1:41:52.640 --> 1:41:56.880]  they just send us the ballots in the mail. So we don't, there is no polling stations or any
[1:41:56.880 --> 1:41:59.520]  that kind of stuff. You know, I mean, I don't know why they don't do that everywhere.
[1:42:01.040 --> 1:42:04.640]  Well, the Oregon's already won't, you know, kind of taken over with the socialist game.
[1:42:04.640 --> 1:42:08.480]  But what's funny is that then they do some good things. There's some sensible things
[1:42:08.480 --> 1:42:14.720]  that liberals do like GMO labeling and, you know, animal welfare, common sense stuff.
[1:42:14.720 --> 1:42:18.160]  So they get all the compassionate, well-meaning people working for their team,
[1:42:18.160 --> 1:42:23.120]  not knowing they're helping bring down the drawbridge. Good to hear from you, Jim.
[1:42:23.120 --> 1:42:29.600]  Will in Virginia, what's your take on election 2014? A major realignment? Or just more business
[1:42:29.600 --> 1:42:35.920]  as usual? And what do you expect the Lord and Savior, Obama, Lord Obama, Lord Ebola,
[1:42:35.920 --> 1:42:40.080]  what are you expecting to do after he's a lame duck and he's got that pardon power?
[1:42:41.040 --> 1:42:46.160]  Well, I have two points of a good, Alex. I'm a natural pathic doctor in Virginia.
[1:42:46.160 --> 1:42:50.880]  And I don't know, also in a small supplement company, Zaletic, we make nanosilver-based
[1:42:50.880 --> 1:42:56.960]  products. But basically, I want to say that your X2 and your DNA force, we've been having amazing
[1:42:56.960 --> 1:43:04.560]  results with those. The DNA force helping with epilepsy patients, a couple of them are changing
[1:43:04.560 --> 1:43:11.840]  diet and detoxing the body. But also, the X2, just amazing what it's able to do to actually
[1:43:11.840 --> 1:43:18.160]  repair the thyroid and not only protect it, we're seeing young kids reverse the homosexuality over
[1:43:18.160 --> 1:43:23.360]  a course of six or nine months, taking higher doses than you guys recommend. So it's great stuff.
[1:43:24.560 --> 1:43:33.520]  And my recommendation, or my second point about the election is, I almost see it as
[1:43:33.520 --> 1:43:38.560]  just a big scam because at the end of the day, if you look at who owns the election
[1:43:38.560 --> 1:43:42.720]  boxes and all this electronic voting, are our votes even getting counted?
[1:43:42.720 --> 1:43:46.480]  Is it almost like a divide and conquer thing, the whole voter ID?
[1:43:48.800 --> 1:43:54.960]  Well, look, I never show ID for hardly anything except when it's your bank account or
[1:43:55.920 --> 1:44:01.200]  you're getting on an international flight. You got to prove who you are because of identity theft
[1:44:01.200 --> 1:44:06.960]  and they are purposely making you show an ID for stuff you don't need to. But then not showing
[1:44:06.960 --> 1:44:12.080]  an ID for voting, when it's your identity, you supposedly registered, you've got to have these
[1:44:12.080 --> 1:44:16.160]  controls in there or there will be fraud. And then you've got the electronic voting machine
[1:44:16.160 --> 1:44:21.360]  fraud and flipping votes to Democrats. Clearly, Democrats are in charge of the machine right now.
[1:44:22.080 --> 1:44:25.360]  And it could be like folks thought Harry Truman was going to lose and he ended up winning.
[1:44:28.160 --> 1:44:31.440]  I don't know if they're going to give the Senate to the Republicans. Now,
[1:44:31.440 --> 1:44:37.680]  it may be such a big landslide, they can't stop them, but we could see some surprises. We'll
[1:44:37.680 --> 1:44:42.560]  find out. We'll find out by tomorrow morning, won't we? Thank you so much, Will. Look at,
[1:44:44.320 --> 1:44:47.040]  you know, past stuff that's gone on this country. There's no telling what's going to happen.
[1:44:47.760 --> 1:44:53.360]  We'll have live coverage, six o'clock central to midnight tonight, prisonplanet.tv,
[1:44:53.360 --> 1:44:59.520]  infowarsnews.com, click on the election button, right hand corner of infowars.com,

[1:45:03.680 --> 1:45:08.080]  we're going to have an audio feed linked up there as well tonight for folks that don't have
[1:45:08.080 --> 1:45:12.880]  high level bandwidth. We will direct over the radio show and preempt the radio show,
[1:45:12.880 --> 1:45:18.880]  refeed if we're able to do that and put out the audio feed of that as well tonight,
[1:45:18.880 --> 1:45:26.240]  six to midnight, infowars nightly news will cover the election. Jake in Arkansas. Thanks for calling.
[1:45:26.240 --> 1:45:33.840]  Hi, Alex. My name is Jacob Holloway. I'm the Libertarian Party candidate for
[1:45:33.840 --> 1:45:39.840]  Arkansas Secretary of State. Oh, great. And what I'd like to talk about is something very serious.
[1:45:40.800 --> 1:45:47.840]  Something I was actually attacked for during my debate is the electronic voting. And I was
[1:45:47.840 --> 1:45:55.440]  actually against the electronic voting question in our debate. And I was attacked for this because
[1:45:55.440 --> 1:46:01.600]  I was asked, you know, how could we all vote on paper ballot? And today, just today in the news,
[1:46:02.320 --> 1:46:07.760]  I discovered, and now it's out in the media here in Arkansas that the electronic voting machines
[1:46:07.760 --> 1:46:13.920]  in Arkansas are switching votes. Well, election fraud in Arkansas is like election fraud in Chicago.
[1:46:13.920 --> 1:46:22.960]  It's ubiquitous like water and wet. It is just famous. And people don't know paper ballots are
[1:46:22.960 --> 1:46:27.760]  easier. And a lot of industrialized countries use them because you tabulate them at the precinct.
[1:46:28.320 --> 1:46:34.400]  That is done in front of everyone. It's posted on the wall. And then all those numbers are then
[1:46:34.400 --> 1:46:40.080]  for the larger sector put together. And then there's total transparency. The only way
[1:46:41.200 --> 1:46:47.280]  you'll get somewhat of a fair election, because elections have always been a competition of fraud
[1:46:47.280 --> 1:46:53.200]  to a certain extent is to have paper ballots counted at the precinct level tabulated then at
[1:46:53.200 --> 1:46:59.280]  the county level and publicly available info. Don't you agree? And that's exactly what I said
[1:46:59.280 --> 1:47:04.320]  during the debate. That's what exactly I said to the press. I was attacked for that. Well,
[1:47:04.320 --> 1:47:07.760]  of course, I mean, if you said that you needed water in the Sahara Desert, the average trendy
[1:47:07.760 --> 1:47:13.280]  would call you a racist. Exactly. And but I did make some good points. And I did point out we're
[1:47:13.280 --> 1:47:19.760]  not keeping data on the votes that are changing. And we're not keeping track of the machines
[1:47:19.760 --> 1:47:25.040]  that are disfunctioning. They're actually still using machines that are dysfunctioning today.
[1:47:25.040 --> 1:47:30.560]  The Arkansas Secretary of State Board of Elections actually came out and said that they knew that
[1:47:30.560 --> 1:47:33.600]  the machines were faulty before they use. Oh, yeah, that's the tactic. They come out and
[1:47:33.600 --> 1:47:38.080]  admit it's all fraud. See, here's what happens. You run for dog catcher. You run for city council.
[1:47:38.080 --> 1:47:42.080]  You run for secretary of state. You run for attorney general. Even if you don't win,
[1:47:42.080 --> 1:47:47.360]  and sometimes you will, especially in this climate, you're there getting in the middle
[1:47:47.360 --> 1:47:52.720]  of their fake event, bombing it with truth. And so that's why everybody should just start
[1:47:52.720 --> 1:47:56.720]  running for office. Even if you don't like the system and don't believe in voting,
[1:47:56.720 --> 1:48:02.400]  go do it to crash their gates to get in the fight. It's fun. Thank you so much, Jake. Tell us
[1:48:02.400 --> 1:48:07.760]  about your website. How do folks find out about you? You can look me up. I'm on the on Google.
[1:48:07.760 --> 1:48:14.480]  You just look up Jacob Holloway for Secretary of State in Arkansas and you can very exciting,
[1:48:14.480 --> 1:48:19.600]  very exciting. Maybe you can run against family Malik up there. Shelby in Tennessee, you're on
[1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:26.320]  the air. Hello, Alex. Hey, brother. Enjoy. Enjoy your show, man. Subscribe to you, but I'll
[1:48:26.320 --> 1:48:29.840]  listen to you on the podcast while I'm out and about every day. Well, thank you, brother.
[1:48:31.200 --> 1:48:36.320]  Hey, just want to say something about the election going on. I went to vote. I have to vote early
[1:48:36.320 --> 1:48:41.360]  because I'm not at home, you know, very, well, very often. But anyway,
[1:48:43.120 --> 1:48:50.000]  and I went and I voted in the early primaries back in the spring here. And the lady looked at me.
[1:48:50.000 --> 1:48:55.840]  Of course, I told her I was and then when she looked on the road, she says, well, I can't find you.
[1:48:56.480 --> 1:49:00.880]  And so what do you mean you can't find me? I just voted back in the spring. Here's my license.
[1:49:01.600 --> 1:49:06.000]  And she says, oh, oh, we won't need that. Let me just keep looking for you. And I gave
[1:49:06.000 --> 1:49:12.400]  her my name again. And she called one of the other ladies over and she says, I can't find
[1:49:12.400 --> 1:49:19.840]  him on the road. And I said, look, I just voted last spring. Here's my license. We won't need that.
[1:49:20.800 --> 1:49:26.960]  Well, then she says to me in the middle of this crowd, she says, what is your social security
[1:49:26.960 --> 1:49:32.960]  number? And I said, look, man, I'm not going to tell you that. I'll write it down for you. I'll
[1:49:32.960 --> 1:49:37.120]  show you my card, whatever. But I'm not going to tell you what my social security number is.
[1:49:38.160 --> 1:49:44.320]  She got so freaking mad at me, Alex. She says, look, mister, do you want to vote or do you not
[1:49:44.320 --> 1:49:50.720]  want to vote? We can have it either way. And I was like, what is going on? And one of the other
[1:49:50.720 --> 1:49:56.000]  older, older gentlemen that was there, he says, he told her, he says, just look at your social
[1:49:56.000 --> 1:49:59.680]  security number and call lines up and you look at it by your social security number.
[1:49:59.680 --> 1:50:07.280]  But she looked at it and she says, well, there you are. Right there. Well, there you are. Here's
[1:50:07.280 --> 1:50:13.760]  your, here's everything you need to go vote. And I was like, my gosh, what is going on here? You
[1:50:13.760 --> 1:50:19.600]  know, what happened is they didn't give it to you until you showed that. So they might have been
[1:50:19.600 --> 1:50:23.840]  in their own way trying to stop fraud. But I don't know the Tennessee law, but I don't think they
[1:50:23.840 --> 1:50:28.640]  make you show a social security number there. Do they? Well, that was my point. That's what I
[1:50:28.640 --> 1:50:33.760]  told her. I said, do you, I'm not going to blur it out my social security number just because you
[1:50:33.760 --> 1:50:40.160]  asked me for it. And the other fellow that was there, he said, show her your card or whatever.
[1:50:40.160 --> 1:50:46.240]  So we, I had my driver's license. We all want your driver's license. Just give us the, so I did.
[1:50:46.240 --> 1:50:51.440]  Got it. Got my voting. I'm out the door. So I'm like, you know, this stuff here,
[1:50:51.440 --> 1:50:56.080]  they're talking about voter fraud. My gosh, if you got to go through that because you're a legal
[1:50:56.080 --> 1:51:00.400]  sis, I've been voting since I was 18. I hear you brother, we're going to come back. This hour

[1:53:01.360 --> 1:53:06.640]  protected with glutathione to neutralize incoming irritants. In the absence of enough glutathione,
[1:53:06.640 --> 1:53:11.600]  your lungs are more prone to irritation. Listen to the real world results of one man using
[1:53:11.600 --> 1:53:16.560]  a powerful glutathione-supporting food. Hi, my name is Bill O'Brien. I've generally suffered
[1:53:16.560 --> 1:53:21.280]  through an asthmatic breathing type situation. My breathing is shallow and generally constricted
[1:53:21.280 --> 1:53:26.080]  in the nose and lungs. After consuming one while away today, I have tremendous energy
[1:53:26.080 --> 1:53:31.600]  and also notice my breathing is free. I can feel the air in my left nostril and it is free all the
[1:53:31.600 --> 1:53:36.480]  way to my abdomen, which is bitterly remarkable because I rarely get that feeling. Being a singer,
[1:53:36.480 --> 1:53:41.440]  I love feeling this unrestricted voice. The only thing that I've actually added to my routine is
[1:53:41.440 --> 1:54:07.440]  One World Way. Wow. Call 888-988-3325. That's 888-988-3325 or visit oneworldway.com. That's One World.

[1:54:16.400 --> 1:54:22.240]  I won't even turn my head. I won't even turn my head. Don't call your kin folks to give me a talking
[1:54:22.240 --> 1:54:30.800]  to. Don't send your kin folks to give me no talking. I'll be gone. I'll be gone, like I said.
[1:54:30.800 --> 1:54:37.920]  Lay there in your bed. You'd say the same old thing that you've been saying all along.
[1:54:37.920 --> 1:54:45.600]  Lay there in your bed, keep your mouth shut till I'm gone. Don't give me that old familiar
[1:54:45.600 --> 1:54:54.000]  crying person moan. Understand your man. Understand your man. Doughty bad talking. Bad mouthing.
[1:54:54.000 --> 1:55:05.040]  Understand your man. That's a little sexist out of control. Homophobic Johnny Cash being
[1:55:05.040 --> 1:55:09.840]  sarcastic there. You want to know why the system's attacking the Tea Party and the Republican leadership
[1:55:09.840 --> 1:55:16.080]  has been lined up against it for years? Story out of Yahoo Finance linked on infowars.com.
[1:55:16.080 --> 1:55:21.760]  Former Nixon insider Tea Party destroying Republican party. The ones that wrote Obamacare
[1:55:21.760 --> 1:55:26.000]  with Obama. The ones that funded Al Qaeda. The ones that passed the Patriot Act. The ones that
[1:55:26.000 --> 1:55:29.360]  helped the NSA spy on us. The ones that built all the presidents. The ones that,
[1:55:30.240 --> 1:55:35.280]  evening the traitors of those, aid to imperial president trashes constitutionalist.
[1:55:38.400 --> 1:55:45.840]  If the polls hold, 2014 should be a banner year for Republicans. But John Huntsman Sr.,
[1:55:46.800 --> 1:55:51.200]  a self-described lifelong Republican and former special assistant to President Richard Nixon,
[1:55:51.200 --> 1:55:55.200]  is looking ahead with concern about the grand old party's 2016 prospects.
[1:55:56.000 --> 1:56:01.280]  The Tea Party has completely captivated and ruined the Republican Party. Oh,
[1:56:01.280 --> 1:56:06.080]  you're scared, aren't you? Today, and they'll show this in 2016, says Huntsman,
[1:56:06.080 --> 1:56:10.400]  author of Barefoot the Billionaire. Unless a Jeff Bush comes in or a John Huntsman
[1:56:10.400 --> 1:56:15.360]  Jr., the Republicans don't have a prayer. Unless your son saves us.
[1:56:15.360 --> 1:56:24.640]  How disgusting. They have one of these Nixonian slimeballs. One of these country club Republicans.
[1:56:25.600 --> 1:56:29.760]  I mean, boy was Richard Nixon a racist, too. This whole crowd. That's when you got horrible
[1:56:29.760 --> 1:56:34.320]  Communist Socialist Democrats that are racist. And then you got all these old racist white people
[1:56:34.320 --> 1:56:39.360]  that are helping destroy the country. I mean, it's just a bunch of scum calling the Tea Party
[1:56:39.360 --> 1:56:42.880]  racist when all wants to save the country. The Republicans have tried to take it over. They
[1:56:42.880 --> 1:56:47.920]  failed. So now they want to destroy it. But it's the reason the Republicans are popular
[1:56:47.920 --> 1:56:53.680]  is people think they might do something. They might cut taxes. They might get rid of Obamacare.
[1:56:53.680 --> 1:56:59.280]  And I expect that immediately. People should be calling Banner's office right now saying,
[1:56:59.280 --> 1:57:04.400]  you don't start repealing this, buddy. 100% of it. We want you in peace right now, scum.
[1:57:05.280 --> 1:57:09.680]  We need to immediately go after the Republican leadership. And that's going to happen.
[1:57:09.680 --> 1:57:13.520]  Because killing this country is a big deal. And you guys are really doing it. That's the thing.
[1:57:13.520 --> 1:57:18.560]  You're going to get a fight, boys, because you really are gutting the golden goose morons.
[1:57:19.840 --> 1:57:23.120]  Because the globalists want to conquer the country. They're afraid of the free market.
[1:57:23.120 --> 1:57:27.440]  They're afraid of freedom because you might not run everything completely. It'd be better for
[1:57:27.440 --> 1:57:32.000]  the establishment to be rich and powerful and not run everything than run it in the ground.
[1:57:32.000 --> 1:57:38.000]  You people are morons. You have inherited the power structure that had problems,
[1:57:38.000 --> 1:57:44.160]  but wasn't totally insane. And you are running it in the ground. You are vandalizing this country.
[1:57:49.040 --> 1:57:52.080]  We got one minute before we go to break. We'll come back with more calls than Tucker Carlson.
[1:57:52.080 --> 1:57:57.600]  I forgot to play the interview with James O'Keefe, the exclusive. We'll play that at like
[1:58:00.080 --> 1:58:04.720]  45 after or something with Carlson. And the whole thing will be on the nightly news tonight
[1:58:04.720 --> 1:58:08.160]  when we do the news. I'm going to come back and go to break. We're going to go to break.
[1:58:08.160 --> 1:58:11.120]  I'm going to come back and take your calls. But I don't even get to the James O'Keefe
[1:58:11.120 --> 1:58:14.720]  exclusive. We got new breaking stuff. We should just take that five minutes. We've got
[1:58:14.720 --> 1:58:18.080]  put it on YouTube and have an article written about it. And then have the whole nightly,
[1:58:18.080 --> 1:58:21.760]  that nightly news piece, a powerful interview. We're going to have election coverage tonight,
[1:58:22.720 --> 1:58:31.600]  six to midnight central. That's five to 11 p.m. mountain. That's five to whenever it is

[2:00:19.200 --> 2:00:31.360]  from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones. Tucker Carlson's coming up with a daily caller.
[2:00:33.760 --> 2:00:37.680]  Say what you want about Tucker Carlson, but I've said good things, bad things over the
[2:00:37.680 --> 2:00:43.200]  years. He's an interesting guy. He's got a great website. A lot of good libertarian
[2:00:43.200 --> 2:00:47.120]  American ideas, a lot of breaking news. Drudge loves it. Obviously, it's on there every day.
[2:00:48.800 --> 2:00:53.360]  Damon or Damien in Indiana, you're on the air. Thanks for calling. Thanks for holding.
[2:00:54.160 --> 2:00:59.920]  Hi, my name is Damien Stanziano. I'm the Libertarian candidate here in District 41
[2:00:59.920 --> 2:01:06.240]  for Indiana State Senate. It's been a really tough battle this whole campaign trying to be
[2:01:06.240 --> 2:01:11.040]  recognized. The newspapers run several stories talking about the two candidates that are
[2:01:11.040 --> 2:01:14.800]  running the Democrat and Republican, completely admitting the fact that I'm even in the race.
[2:01:16.000 --> 2:01:21.680]  I've contacted the NRA about being endorsed by them. I was told by the NRA that we're not interested
[2:01:21.680 --> 2:01:28.000]  in third-party candidates and basically told, you know, don't let the door hit you on the way out.
[2:01:28.000 --> 2:01:35.280]  Yeah, there is any charity or lobbying group that ends up giving money to third-party candidates.
[2:01:35.840 --> 2:01:40.640]  The Federal Elections Commission comes after them. So it's a monopoly with the two parties
[2:01:41.760 --> 2:01:48.000]  over elections. It's a closed shop. And I understand the idea of breaking it up. I want to do that.
[2:01:48.000 --> 2:01:52.720]  But then we are faced with this election and some libertarians are getting elected.
[2:01:52.720 --> 2:01:58.080]  That's why they're so scared of the Libertarian Party. America's largest and oldest third party.
[2:01:58.080 --> 2:02:03.440]  Well, I support, you know, lowering your income taxes here in Indiana down to zero,
[2:02:03.440 --> 2:02:08.000]  just like Texas has, and increasing that homestead exemption up to 100 percent,
[2:02:08.000 --> 2:02:13.840]  like the governor candidate in Florida wants to do. So I don't know what more to do to let
[2:02:13.840 --> 2:02:18.560]  the people know, let the voters know that, you know, the Republican Party is not the party of
[2:02:18.560 --> 2:02:22.640]  Eisenhower anymore and the Democratic Party is not the party of Kennedy anymore. They're both
[2:02:22.640 --> 2:02:29.840]  the same corporate greedy criminal parties. That's it. Who are using government and selective
[2:02:29.840 --> 2:02:34.800]  enforcement to take over the economy and shut down their competition? They are cancer. Good to
[2:02:34.800 --> 2:02:44.880]  hear from you. Wild Man in Texas. Thank you for calling. You remember about five years ago, at
[2:02:44.880 --> 2:02:50.000]  least five years ago, when they had this national scoop of illegal aliens and they bussed them all
[2:02:50.000 --> 2:02:54.640]  up and took them out of here. Yeah, I mean, I mean, it was a front before they tried to pass
[2:02:54.640 --> 2:02:59.440]  amnesty. They'd bussed a few meatpacking plants and a few facilities. I mean, it was still just
[2:02:59.440 --> 2:03:04.320]  for show, but yes. Yeah, they did it up here. I'm in the fan house. They did it at Texas,
[2:03:04.320 --> 2:03:08.080]  where there's a big packing house. Well, they did that and they got them all out of here and then
[2:03:08.080 --> 2:03:14.800]  they turned right around and they got all the Somalians in, Guatemalan and Afghan in here.
[2:03:14.800 --> 2:03:19.840]  And now that's who's messing with our food. You know, it is really, I mean, here's the deal. I
[2:03:19.840 --> 2:03:25.600]  almost get Mexicans coming in because they border us. It's been part of Mexico before. I mean,
[2:03:25.600 --> 2:03:32.960]  I get it. I don't get why the government ships massive amounts of Somalis in to just take over
[2:03:32.960 --> 2:03:37.360]  whole industries in Minneapolis, St. Paul and other cities or whole groups. I mean, they're just,
[2:03:37.360 --> 2:03:42.400]  the government is doing this on purpose to break the country up so none of us can communicate
[2:03:42.400 --> 2:03:47.680]  with each other. It's Tower of Babel. Yeah. And I mean, they're messing with our food. So these
[2:03:47.680 --> 2:03:51.440]  people, like you said, you know, the boulders are open. They're letting all these thugs in now and
[2:03:51.440 --> 2:03:57.200]  stuff that are from God knows where. Yeah, let's be clear. They let felons go who've committed
[2:03:57.200 --> 2:04:02.720]  aggravated assaults. And then, you know, the Fox News is asking the sheriff, why do they do this?
[2:04:02.720 --> 2:04:08.000]  They're just like, we don't know. No, because they, there's a criminal takeover. Stalin opened up the
[2:04:08.000 --> 2:04:12.800]  jails and, you know, got a bunch of people to work for. And Hitler did that at first. I mean,
[2:04:12.800 --> 2:04:18.640]  this is what they do. This is a criminal takeover. Castro sent them to us, you know,
[2:04:18.640 --> 2:04:23.120]  and now everybody else is doing it again. And then they print 60 million dream cards for these
[2:04:23.120 --> 2:04:26.800]  people. That's right. I don't know how many of them will actually do it. I'll go vote because
[2:04:26.800 --> 2:04:30.800]  they're probably scared they'll get scooped up again. Well, listen, listen, newspapers all over
[2:04:30.800 --> 2:04:34.400]  Latin America, we've shown them advertised go to America. Here's how to do it. President Obama
[2:04:34.400 --> 2:04:39.120]  wants you free money waiting. In fact, in Spanish, it's free money and a better life waiting go.
[2:04:40.080 --> 2:04:43.520]  And then, I mean, they're going to take over. They're going to get our guns. I mean, this is
[2:04:43.520 --> 2:04:47.680]  it. And then they're going to go. We vote to take the guns. You won't turn them in. Homeland
[2:04:47.680 --> 2:04:52.080]  Security killed the terrorists. Vehicles roll out against us. I mean, it's all been planned.
[2:04:52.080 --> 2:04:57.120]  I don't know if it's a year from now, 10 years from now, but they admit at the gun control groups,
[2:04:57.120 --> 2:05:02.000]  they're going to get our guns. They're coming. The government's Department of Homeland Security
[2:05:02.000 --> 2:05:06.560]  is buying up loads of ammo. At the same time, they're restricting civilians rights to own
[2:05:06.560 --> 2:05:11.840]  and purchase firearms. Can you put two and two together? Infidel Body Armor can stop every

[2:09:36.720 --> 2:09:43.920]  i think the story over the next two years is going to be chaos there's some there is a lot of
[2:09:43.920 --> 2:09:48.160]  movement just beneath the surface of american politics i think in american society i think
[2:09:48.160 --> 2:09:55.040]  globally actually um and that's evidence that things are realigning and we're right in the middle
[2:09:55.040 --> 2:09:59.360]  of it so it's hard to see it it's hard to step back and get perspective on what's happening but the
[2:09:59.360 --> 2:10:04.000]  world is going to look a lot different in two years our assumptions now you know that hillary
[2:10:04.000 --> 2:10:08.480]  clinton is going to run against jeb bush i think all of them will be proven wrong in the end as
[2:10:08.480 --> 2:10:13.840]  people start to move to places politically they never thought they would be and that's one of the
[2:10:13.840 --> 2:10:17.360]  reasons that we're having so much trouble forecasting what's going to happen tonight
[2:10:17.360 --> 2:10:21.920]  i mean it should be as you know it should be a pretty clean sweep for republicans the president
[2:10:21.920 --> 2:10:26.400]  incredibly unpopular he's done a lot to earn that people are terrified of the direction the
[2:10:26.400 --> 2:10:30.880]  country's moving and so the party not in power ought to be the beneficiaries of that obviously
[2:10:30.880 --> 2:10:34.560]  that's always the way it's worked up until this year and yet republicans are having
[2:10:34.560 --> 2:10:38.560]  trouble sealing the deal why is that because things are just much more confusing than they've
[2:10:38.560 --> 2:10:44.720]  ever been daily caller dot com i've got a stack of the breaking news you've got up there today
[2:10:45.680 --> 2:10:51.680]  a lot of news about election fraud vote flipping going on pollster says obama may be the most
[2:10:51.680 --> 2:10:58.640]  destructive president to his own party we saw what ben stein on fox news saying he's the most
[2:10:58.640 --> 2:11:02.960]  racist president ever i don't know if i agree with that but he certainly has race baited
[2:11:02.960 --> 2:11:09.200]  and used race more than any president in recent history exactly what do you think about i have no
[2:11:09.200 --> 2:11:14.640]  idea what's in his heart i have no idea what his true beliefs are but it's very clear they've made
[2:11:14.640 --> 2:11:19.200]  it as clear as it's ever been in the last two weeks that they're willing to use race to divide
[2:11:19.200 --> 2:11:26.160]  the country and get out the vote and use racial fears to get their base um you know out to the
[2:11:26.160 --> 2:11:31.440]  polls and i think it's effective it works fear works it works for me by the way i'm motivated
[2:11:31.440 --> 2:11:36.720]  well i'm afraid it motivates me i think human beings are all that way but in the case of racial
[2:11:36.720 --> 2:11:42.880]  division there's a consequence that lasts far beyond election day if you stoke people up along
[2:11:42.880 --> 2:11:47.760]  racial lines you get ethnic politics and look around the world you travel you know practically
[2:11:47.760 --> 2:11:53.200]  every other country on the planet is divided by ethnic politics we haven't been historically
[2:11:53.200 --> 2:11:56.640]  um but we're moving in that direction and it's really scary because ethnic politics
[2:11:56.640 --> 2:12:00.560]  doesn't go away if you and i disagree on an issue the issue can be resolved that we can
[2:12:00.560 --> 2:12:05.760]  become friends again if we're divided by race race is immutable it doesn't change we're always
[2:12:05.760 --> 2:12:10.320]  divided and those divisions can be bitter they can turn violent i mean you don't even want to
[2:12:10.320 --> 2:12:14.160]  play with that stuff and they're doing it in a big way and it's reckless there was a rass music
[2:12:14.160 --> 2:12:21.600]  poll yesterday um reporting that 77 of americans think that race baiting is just a desperate tactic
[2:12:21.600 --> 2:12:26.080]  uh and a political diversion and they think it doesn't work anymore i agree with you that it
[2:12:26.080 --> 2:12:32.080]  still works to a certain extent that's why they're using it but that time's running out for that
[2:12:32.080 --> 2:12:37.440]  but there's a real attempt by the establishment by the large elements of it to kind of use the
[2:12:37.440 --> 2:12:42.720]  british great game of divide and conquer uh here on america and that's why they want to
[2:12:42.720 --> 2:12:47.600]  flood us with all these illegals not to bring in new blood and folks to pay social security
[2:12:47.600 --> 2:12:52.240]  because we've aborted all our you know our future of 50 something million people
[2:12:52.240 --> 2:12:57.040]  but to create that balkanization i don't i don't think there's any doubt about it
[2:12:57.040 --> 2:13:02.640]  there's no doubt that they see immigration as a source of political power and that's scary i mean
[2:13:02.640 --> 2:13:09.360]  look you know i like every american i'm i grew up on the border like you i'm kind of pro immigrant
[2:13:09.360 --> 2:13:14.400]  in a lot of ways a lot of immigrants work hard i'm totally for it but massive amounts of low
[2:13:14.400 --> 2:13:18.320]  wage low skilled immigration are exactly the opposite of what you want when you've got high
[2:13:18.320 --> 2:13:23.760]  unemployment so they clearly just don't care at all about people who are earning you know a wage in
[2:13:23.760 --> 2:13:27.520]  the united states they just don't care at all if it's a trait you know it's a trade-off between
[2:13:27.520 --> 2:13:32.560]  helping the middle class helping ordinary people and shoring up their own political power they
[2:13:32.560 --> 2:13:37.120]  don't think twice you know you know what side they're on even though it'll end up hurting their
[2:13:37.120 --> 2:13:42.160]  children and grandchildren tucker carlson daily caller dot com uh is our guest i want to shift
[2:13:42.160 --> 2:13:47.120]  out of the election for a moment before we go back into it what's the state of the media right now
[2:13:47.120 --> 2:13:52.400]  because we're seeing billions of web pages being created a year when it was just 30 something million
[2:13:52.400 --> 2:14:00.720]  back in 1996 we're seeing a dilution in the media but at the same time we're seeing kind of libertarian
[2:14:00.720 --> 2:14:06.480]  patriot type paleo conservative sites like drudge report dot com daily caller dot com and others
[2:14:06.480 --> 2:14:13.200]  rising uh in a climate of where pretty much all the democratic party type sites we see precipitous
[2:14:13.200 --> 2:14:18.160]  drops to the point they've now rigged the lexa to show our ratings dropping while our internal
[2:14:18.160 --> 2:14:23.040]  ratings show we're skyrocketing but just like nielson's been caught fixing things for msnbc
[2:14:23.680 --> 2:14:29.040]  it just doesn't work in the final equation anymore i mean as you said we are in a realignment
[2:14:29.040 --> 2:14:32.960]  and so the earthquake's happening right now we don't know what the landscape will be in a year or two
[2:14:32.960 --> 2:14:39.200]  but we can kind of get some ideas uh what do you expect uh the the establishment media to do
[2:14:39.200 --> 2:14:44.160]  because all the moves they're doing doubling down on lying doubling down on dumbing it down
[2:14:44.720 --> 2:14:51.760]  that is causing an even faster exodus away from uh those traditional media outlets and they seem to
[2:14:51.760 --> 2:14:58.400]  just be accelerating what's not working i think that's a really good analysis they are hysterical
[2:14:58.400 --> 2:15:03.280]  people who see the end coming tend to get hysterical a lot of these are people who
[2:15:03.840 --> 2:15:09.280]  can't function outside the media they never make it to the normal job the only option for them is
[2:15:09.280 --> 2:15:15.120]  to go to some depressing pr firm they know it you know they've had really easy jobs all these
[2:15:15.120 --> 2:15:20.800]  years they've had a full monopoly on information in the country and they're looking at retirement
[2:15:20.800 --> 2:15:26.320]  years that are pretty bleak and so they're lashing out i would say and they've totally
[2:15:26.320 --> 2:15:31.760]  abandoned their standards i mean they've always been obviously aligned with the democratic party
[2:15:31.760 --> 2:15:36.240]  but they've always been a liberal most journalists are liberal but after the 2008 election they just
[2:15:36.240 --> 2:15:41.840]  took the mask off and they're just kind of openly cheerleading for one political party and in so
[2:15:41.840 --> 2:15:46.880]  doing as you just said they devalue their own currency nobody believes them anymore NBC is the
[2:15:46.880 --> 2:15:51.440]  least trusted news organization in the country when did that happen i mean it didn't it didn't
[2:15:51.440 --> 2:15:55.760]  take long by the way i i don't know exactly the numbers were but i bet 15 years ago NBC was
[2:15:55.760 --> 2:16:01.360]  probably number two behind ABC and now they're at the bottom so that tells you what you get when
[2:16:01.360 --> 2:16:07.280]  you just decide you know what i'm no longer at the news company i'm a you know a political
[2:16:07.280 --> 2:16:12.640]  operation that's what they are what does it mean for them how do you see the fall of the dinosaurs
[2:16:12.640 --> 2:16:16.320]  because they're already in the desert they're already don't have any water they start some
[2:16:16.320 --> 2:16:22.640]  are starting to fall down and die uh and they're in their death rows and obviously government
[2:16:22.640 --> 2:16:26.720]  can't come in with censorship and regulation though they're trying uh to save the day no
[2:16:26.720 --> 2:16:31.760]  amount of stimulus money the msnbc or mpr is going to put Humpty Dumpty back together again
[2:16:32.320 --> 2:16:38.160]  so if we're beginning to see rigor mortis set in what do you expect the final death rows
[2:16:38.160 --> 2:16:43.840]  to look like and what is your gut as a successful media guy on your own independently and inside
[2:16:43.840 --> 2:16:50.320]  the system uh what do you in your gut think things are going to look like say in five years well i
[2:16:50.320 --> 2:16:55.760]  think look i'm 45 so i'm not that old i remember when i started in this business
[2:16:55.760 --> 2:17:00.000]  me my dad was in this business i've been around it all my life and i remember when i graduated
[2:17:00.000 --> 2:17:04.160]  college thinking i want to work in newsweek or time i mean that was a big deal those were the
[2:17:05.040 --> 2:17:10.800]  best places for a magazine writer to work and i was a magazine writer and now they don't exist
[2:17:10.800 --> 2:17:14.400]  i mean i guess maybe they do technically exist but they kind of slip beneath the waves with
[2:17:14.400 --> 2:17:20.400]  almost no notice newsweek was bought by you know the rich husband of a democratic congresswoman
[2:17:20.400 --> 2:17:24.800]  and then it kind of went bankrupt and now it just exists online i guess sort of i mean
[2:17:24.800 --> 2:17:29.360]  they just kind of faded away but they did so really really quickly and i think the same thing
[2:17:29.360 --> 2:17:34.400]  will happen maybe even faster to the broadcast networks because the truth is you and i could
[2:17:34.400 --> 2:17:38.400]  pull our money and put out a magazine we couldn't pull our money and put out a tv channel because
[2:17:38.400 --> 2:17:43.280]  it's really expensive to operate a television network as you know and so a broadcast television
[2:17:43.280 --> 2:17:48.960]  network so i just think those they're unsustainable i mean they will go away i bet 10 years from now
[2:17:48.960 --> 2:17:53.760]  they won't exist um and it's you know it's kind of a shame i'm not with the news networks there
[2:17:53.760 --> 2:17:58.960]  always be a role for entertainment obviously in sports but the big time news networks i don't
[2:17:58.960 --> 2:18:04.960]  think will be here and i think a lot of it's their fault i mean they don't get it by the way they are
[2:18:04.960 --> 2:18:09.760]  so if you go i mean i spent a lot of time in that world because i live in new york part of the week
[2:18:09.760 --> 2:18:15.200]  and everybody in that world is exactly the same there's no air they never let the door open and
[2:18:15.200 --> 2:18:19.360]  let new ideas or fresh perspectives or people with different backgrounds and they talk about
[2:18:19.360 --> 2:18:24.160]  diversity but it is the most homogeneous group you know that was my next point is just they're
[2:18:24.160 --> 2:18:29.920]  like a cult of dota birds that they don't realize the sailors just arrived they're all about to get
[2:18:29.920 --> 2:18:40.880]  eaten and and when i watch cnn or msnbc especially it is a revolving door of all these democratic
[2:18:40.880 --> 2:18:46.000]  party chiefs of staff and all these hacks and it'd be one thing if they were well spoken or good
[2:18:46.000 --> 2:18:52.400]  looking or interesting or funny but they're so selfish they go advise the network heads to put
[2:18:52.400 --> 2:18:56.400]  them in even though it only makes the ratings drop but they don't care because even though it's a
[2:18:56.400 --> 2:19:01.440]  diminishing narcissistic platform they don't care because they feel like they're successful
[2:19:01.440 --> 2:19:06.320]  when they go home for Thanksgiving with mom and dad i mean i tell you i really think they've lost
[2:19:06.320 --> 2:19:12.080]  control and i think that's why they're counting on the police state tucker is because they think
[2:19:12.080 --> 2:19:16.560]  oppression will work that's not going to work either i think this political class is basically
[2:19:16.560 --> 2:19:22.800]  done well you know i used to think what i of course i agree with you completely i think they're
[2:19:22.800 --> 2:19:27.120]  going to be replaced probably sooner than they realized because we're in this kind of moment of
[2:19:27.120 --> 2:19:32.000]  convulsion and change for sure but what i'm so struck by is how much liberals have changed when
[2:19:32.000 --> 2:19:37.040]  i was a kid but they were at least i believe them to be you know really kind of committed to free
[2:19:37.040 --> 2:19:41.760]  speech i mean they defended the right of the creeps to march at skokie they have so much
[2:19:43.280 --> 2:19:47.920]  i'll die for your right to express yourself even if i disagree something happened along the way i
[2:19:47.920 --> 2:19:52.480]  don't recognize modern liberals they're fully authoritarian they don't want you to speak your
[2:19:52.480 --> 2:19:57.200]  threatening me with your speech i feel uncomfortable you're making this an unsafe place be quiet or
[2:19:57.200 --> 2:20:01.280]  i'll arrest you really they have no regard for the first amendment it's conservatives
[2:20:01.280 --> 2:20:05.200]  who are standing up for the first one that is a total reversal of the way things were when i was a
[2:20:05.200 --> 2:20:09.120]  kid well that's right and that's why people liked liberals even if you disagree with some of their
[2:20:09.120 --> 2:20:14.800]  politics hey they're for free speech hey they're for labeling gmo hey you know they're for diversity
[2:20:14.800 --> 2:20:19.040]  now it's a cult and that was another question i was gonna bring up i could play these clips but
[2:20:19.040 --> 2:20:27.200]  but back when the boston bombing happened they had a host on their say on purpose and they had the
[2:20:27.200 --> 2:20:32.560]  former head of the r.m.c. on there with them agreeing with it yeah they bombed it because they
[2:20:32.560 --> 2:20:37.680]  listened to alex jones and he influenced the bombers and he's deeply racist and i went to my
[2:20:37.680 --> 2:20:41.520]  lawyer and he said yeah you can spend a million bucks win a lawsuit and win maybe two million
[2:20:41.520 --> 2:20:45.600]  dollars kind of like ventura did he said do you want to waste your time it's going to be hell
[2:20:45.600 --> 2:20:53.040]  it is your time worth it and i said no and but but i came to realization msnbc five years ago
[2:20:53.040 --> 2:20:57.920]  would have never come out and said that i'm involved in the boston bombing and i'm deeply racist
[2:20:57.920 --> 2:21:05.120]  without showing some proof even if it was flimsy so yes there is a major shift now where it's like
[2:21:05.120 --> 2:21:10.720]  they're trying to commit suicide politically in front of us and they don't see it because they're
[2:21:10.720 --> 2:21:16.160]  still in the big rotting facade when i went and debated pierce morgan i'd been in those same
[2:21:16.160 --> 2:21:21.120]  studios a few years before they were nice it was rotting the bathrooms were unclean everyone
[2:21:21.120 --> 2:21:27.200]  looked depressed like a demoralized army that was about to collapse and that's what i see them doing
[2:21:27.200 --> 2:21:33.440]  but it's the it's the wildness and the not caring and the no standard i could have sued them in one
[2:21:34.000 --> 2:21:39.040]  and i mean guaranteed my lawyer saying one of the top lawyers in texas and they just of course
[2:21:39.040 --> 2:21:45.040]  i'm not suing them but it shows a recklessness what do you take from that rant well i'm just
[2:21:45.040 --> 2:21:50.960]  i'm my jaw is open as they call you racist i mean it's one thing i hate to say it but that
[2:21:50.960 --> 2:21:56.000]  term has lost almost all meaning it doesn't really mean anything anymore it basically it's a way of
[2:21:56.000 --> 2:22:01.600]  telling you to be quiet we don't want to hear what you're saying what you say threatens our power
[2:22:01.600 --> 2:22:07.600]  therefore shut up i mean that's basically that's the message of your racist it's not the beginning
[2:22:07.600 --> 2:22:12.800]  of a conversation about tolerance or diversity or what racism is it's an attempt to end the
[2:22:12.800 --> 2:22:19.280]  conversation to end your speech by calling you names and it's the most tired thing and the
[2:22:19.280 --> 2:22:24.960]  dumbest thing ever i think it's your very wise not even to get bothered with a lawsuit you know
[2:22:24.960 --> 2:22:30.000]  with them that's just a that's a drain on your energy lawsuits almost always are even when you
[2:22:30.000 --> 2:22:37.040]  win you know it saps all your your mojo i think that's why i brought it up but the recklessness
[2:22:37.040 --> 2:22:41.360]  like when i was on nightline five years ago they tried to fact check they tried to research
[2:22:41.360 --> 2:22:46.560]  yeah they they they tried to discredit me but they did a journalistic job at least half baked
[2:22:46.560 --> 2:22:54.800]  they don't even put the cake in the oven now no no because uh they don't have to yeah because
[2:22:54.800 --> 2:23:00.160]  nobody cares i mean that's kind of the flip side whereas 15 years ago nbc news was a big deal it
[2:23:00.160 --> 2:23:06.640]  was respected people expected that they would do diligence um when they said things now it's like
[2:23:06.640 --> 2:23:11.360]  yeah whatever it's msnbc they're crazy it's the leon trotsky channel nobody cares you know what
[2:23:11.360 --> 2:23:14.880]  it means like there really isn't an expectation that they're accurate in the first place it was
[2:23:14.880 --> 2:23:20.560]  not as big a deal but then daily caller can have millions of visitors every day info wars.com can
[2:23:20.560 --> 2:23:25.280]  have that this talk radio show has conservatively and it's a small show compared to a lot of them
[2:23:25.280 --> 2:23:30.720]  three million people a day uh you count you know youtube and stuff every week it's it's like 15 to
[2:23:30.720 --> 2:23:37.280]  18 million people tune in or watch and then you look at cnn and others and then they're just still
[2:23:38.000 --> 2:23:44.160]  you've been inside there so much are they really arrogant or is it a front tucker oh no oh the arrogant
[2:23:44.160 --> 2:23:50.080]  is bone deep the arrogance is the one thing that's real it's the one thing they all have in common
[2:23:50.080 --> 2:23:56.400]  and again it's a product of never meeting anybody who disagrees with you i mean you know what even
[2:23:56.400 --> 2:24:01.600]  in texas there are lots of people who don't share your views yes there is political diversity in
[2:24:01.600 --> 2:24:05.840]  texas i live in Austin it's a pretty red state but they're blue parts of it you know especially
[2:24:05.840 --> 2:24:12.480]  where you live in um they live in a world where nobody disagrees with them they never meet anybody
[2:24:12.480 --> 2:24:18.640]  with a different view so their impression is that outside of the west side of manhattan they're
[2:24:18.640 --> 2:24:23.520]  everyone's like a cannibal or married to a sister or a handling of snakes or you know smoking meth
[2:24:23.520 --> 2:24:30.640]  like they have the lowest possible opinion of america they really do underestimate america
[2:24:31.600 --> 2:24:35.040]  so in the final equation before we shift back into the election go to break take some calls
[2:24:35.040 --> 2:24:39.520]  we've got a short clip we're going to play of james o keith of the veritas project i want to get your
[2:24:39.520 --> 2:24:46.320]  uh view on what he's been doing as well but so do you expect him to try to then bring in some type of
[2:24:47.520 --> 2:24:51.360]  fairness doctrine over the internet i i know the senate's been talking about that
[2:24:51.360 --> 2:24:57.760]  well i mean i i think that is absolutely the goal and it but it won't be done under the you know
[2:24:57.760 --> 2:25:01.920]  the normal justification the justification was before for the fairness doctrine as you know was
[2:25:01.920 --> 2:25:08.000]  you know we we need the the the airwaves are the public trust they belong to everybody therefore
[2:25:08.000 --> 2:25:12.080]  you ought to have both sides on them now the airwaves don't exist everything is digital
[2:25:12.080 --> 2:25:16.320]  you can't make that um you can't use that as justifications and now they will use some
[2:25:16.320 --> 2:25:21.200]  species of diversity you know that this is a pluralistic country it's a multi-ethnic country and
[2:25:21.200 --> 2:25:26.800]  too many news organizations are owned by one group and we need the government is going to force
[2:25:26.800 --> 2:25:31.520]  equal representation on the airwaves and that's i i i had to guess that will be the justification
[2:25:31.520 --> 2:25:35.520]  and then they'll break up news core set the president to go after everybody else they've
[2:25:35.520 --> 2:25:40.880]  been talking about that and then they'll break up news websites and say you've got to have an area
[2:25:40.880 --> 2:25:44.800]  to show different views in fact you're right that's what they've been proposing and if you're
[2:25:44.800 --> 2:25:50.080]  against it guess what you're uh wait for it racist well i have a lot of problems with you know some
[2:25:50.080 --> 2:25:54.400]  of the things ripper murdoch does i know you work for him but at the same time they're popular
[2:25:54.400 --> 2:26:00.080]  because they have a lot more americana type stuff being promoted the cnn msnbc and all of them combined
[2:26:00.080 --> 2:26:07.520]  but i defended uh them during the hacking scandal because it was clearly political it was clearly
[2:26:07.520 --> 2:26:12.640]  a witch hunt to try to bring them down and basically blackmail them to go along with the
[2:26:12.640 --> 2:26:17.760]  establishment and now that's happening uh with statements out of uh you know ripper murdoch
[2:26:17.760 --> 2:26:23.520]  about how great hillary clinton is i just don't understand why so many of these blue blood conservatives
[2:26:24.640 --> 2:26:30.160]  are attacking the tea party and going with this party line i think the real libertarian tea party
[2:26:30.160 --> 2:26:35.680]  is the hope of the republican party what do you think well i think that's absolutely true i mean
[2:26:35.680 --> 2:26:40.800]  there's a i heard the smartest thing the other day from someone involved in republican politics
[2:26:40.800 --> 2:26:44.960]  he said the democratic party is strong because there's perfect alignment between its donors and
[2:26:44.960 --> 2:26:49.760]  its voters the rich people who fund the democratic party agree completely with the far left of their
[2:26:49.760 --> 2:26:54.160]  base right so george soros agrees with your average primary voter the democratic party
[2:26:54.160 --> 2:27:00.080]  on the conservative side republican donors have total contempt for republican voters
[2:27:00.080 --> 2:27:04.240]  who really i mean the base of the republican party is kind of the tea party libertarian
[2:27:04.240 --> 2:27:10.080]  freedom oriented people you know lower taxes pre socially conservative that's not who funds
[2:27:10.080 --> 2:27:14.720]  the republican party republican party is funded by and large from business wall street and these
[2:27:14.720 --> 2:27:19.520]  are people who want lower taxes less regulation for themselves but they're certainly not above
[2:27:19.520 --> 2:27:24.480]  striking some sort of private deal with politicians to help their businesses they're not at all
[2:27:24.480 --> 2:27:30.640]  socially conservative there is libertinas the democrats and so it's a problem when your funders
[2:27:30.640 --> 2:27:36.800]  hate your voters if you can see what i mean wow what will happen if conservatives and libertarians
[2:27:36.800 --> 2:27:43.040]  realize for survival we've got to start really giving a lot of money to patriot type candidates
[2:27:43.040 --> 2:27:49.440]  well we know what'll happen they'll send in the irs to harass everybody so so we see the weaknesses
[2:27:49.440 --> 2:27:55.120]  of the death star by where they put their defenses we blow up this political monopoly the status
[2:27:55.120 --> 2:28:00.960]  monopoly by not being intimidated by the irs like the preachers are doing now not being intimidated
[2:28:00.960 --> 2:28:06.160]  and politically giving politically running i think we become political animals like i did 20
[2:28:06.160 --> 2:28:12.640]  years ago like you did 30 years ago for basic survival you either get involved or we will
[2:28:12.640 --> 2:28:19.120]  basically go into a pure democracy where hordes of illegals will vote away our freedoms well that
[2:28:19.120 --> 2:28:24.880]  appears to be i mean there's no i mean as someone who grew up in california and looks back at that
[2:28:24.880 --> 2:28:29.520]  state when i grew up in and i'm not that old that state was the richest out of 50 and the nicest
[2:28:29.520 --> 2:28:34.160]  had great schools excellent infrastructure it was pretty reasonable concerned you know politically
[2:28:34.160 --> 2:28:38.640]  now it's a one-party state that's literally crumbling and has more poverty than any other state
[2:28:39.200 --> 2:28:43.280]  why is that well there's only one thing that changed and that's the composition of the
[2:28:43.280 --> 2:28:47.840]  population in california because of immigration so immigration changes your politics dramatically
[2:28:47.840 --> 2:28:52.720]  and and there are a lot of people at the donor level on the republican party side i hate to say it
[2:28:52.720 --> 2:28:57.120]  who really don't care because it means cheaper help for them at home and it means more profits
[2:28:57.120 --> 2:29:01.280]  for their businesses and i think it's a very short-sighted view well that's right it'd be one
[2:29:01.280 --> 2:29:05.200]  thing they're bringing in giant groups of you know people to build them up like ross perot
[2:29:05.200 --> 2:29:09.680]  documented this level of immigration will bring us down and it won't even help the third world
[2:29:09.680 --> 2:29:14.320]  countries they're fleeing no and it won't help the immigrants themselves i mean look at a certain
[2:29:14.320 --> 2:29:19.600]  look at a certain point you know i'm for immigrant i mean i'm for bringing in hard-working smart
[2:29:19.600 --> 2:29:24.000]  people with a lot to contribute i'm totally for absolutely totally against is in a post-industrial
[2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:28.720]  economy bringing in people for whom there are no factory jobs people of fourth grade education
[2:29:28.720 --> 2:29:33.120]  who are poor nothing gets them personally god loves them as much as he loves anybody else but
[2:29:33.120 --> 2:29:36.960]  that's the issue is the democrats want people they can mold into whatever they want exactly
[2:29:36.960 --> 2:29:41.600]  that's exactly it then social engineer lives tucker carlsson dailycaller.com is our guest

[2:33:26.560 --> 2:33:33.200]  Jones look it's very simple you either have government of four by the people based on
[2:33:33.200 --> 2:33:41.840]  free market and basic values or you have law the jungle government of foreign by conquest
[2:33:43.040 --> 2:33:46.480]  and we've seen that that's why there's such beautiful places all around the world
[2:33:46.480 --> 2:33:52.480]  that are in total squalor and have smart people with high IQs that live there but they never had
[2:33:52.480 --> 2:33:58.160]  basic freedom they never had basic values so they're sitting in their own crap i'm sorry to have to
[2:33:58.160 --> 2:34:04.560]  describe it that way and listen my family's all been successful if america collapses just like
[2:34:04.560 --> 2:34:09.440]  we came here on the mayflower and other ventures i'll just go somewhere else even though globally
[2:34:09.440 --> 2:34:15.040]  there's not many other places to go i'm really sad for the general public because the american dream
[2:34:15.040 --> 2:34:20.880]  is being stolen by fraud and then those of us that produce are seen as the greedy enemies
[2:34:20.880 --> 2:34:28.160]  and so many rich elites team up with that because they're crony capitalist if you vote with your
[2:34:28.160 --> 2:34:32.160]  dollars and you vote with your actions and you vote by word of mouth you could change the world
[2:34:33.920 --> 2:34:38.400]  15 years ago you couldn't find organic food as i've said a thousand times almost anywhere in
[2:34:38.400 --> 2:34:44.560]  restaurants in grocery stores there was little boutiques whole foods were tiny wheat fill co-op
[2:34:45.760 --> 2:34:50.560]  fast forward because people started buying it and supporting it it expanded the market drove
[2:34:50.560 --> 2:34:55.920]  down prices with competition now you go to a target or a walmart they at least say it's organic or
[2:34:55.920 --> 2:35:02.400]  non-gmo and the and the ketchup isn't in a sugar it's not high fructose you know corn syrup just
[2:35:02.400 --> 2:35:10.000]  your voting over 15 years has almost overthrown their system mcdonald's as a third is down 33
[2:35:10.000 --> 2:35:15.600]  percent this year 20 percent last year and so is all the other major fast food people are done
[2:35:15.600 --> 2:35:22.560]  just by voting and demanding some quality you got it now so many other fronts we don't demand it
[2:35:22.560 --> 2:35:29.440]  so we get things degenerating when you promote info wars dot com or prison planet dot com or
[2:35:29.440 --> 2:35:34.240]  daily caller dot com or drudge report dot com or world net daily dot com none of us are perfect
[2:35:34.240 --> 2:35:38.880]  got a bunch of writers i say stuff that's wrong sometimes i'm a different person than i was 10
[2:35:38.880 --> 2:35:43.600]  years ago the point is i'm trying to be good i'm trying to tell the truth i'm trying to be honorable
[2:35:43.600 --> 2:35:49.840]  i'm trying to have a future for my kids and when you buy the books the videos the supplements spread
[2:35:49.840 --> 2:35:55.120]  the word support our local affiliates you don't see it but that's what grows the liberty movement
[2:35:55.120 --> 2:36:00.880]  just like with organic food or anything else and if libertarian conservatives would just start running
[2:36:00.880 --> 2:36:05.920]  for office even if you don't win to educate people would just start giving money not just
[2:36:05.920 --> 2:36:11.760]  to politicians or statesmen but would start buying cases of books and give them to people
[2:36:11.760 --> 2:36:17.280]  and buy in cases of the new film utopia that we're distributing the worthy exclusive distributor of
[2:36:18.960 --> 2:36:24.240]  up until december there's no place like utopia by joel gilbert excellent film about the free market
[2:36:24.240 --> 2:36:29.200]  and the nightmare of socialism and collectivism everyone should see that you know the truth
[2:36:29.200 --> 2:36:35.840]  your grandkids don't your kids don't the library donate it it's the only reason i've been successful
[2:36:35.840 --> 2:36:40.160]  and i'm going to tucker carlson and i want to get his take on what i just said is because
[2:36:40.160 --> 2:36:45.760]  there's no training in rtf no nothing and and you can see that the first 10 15 years i didn't
[2:36:45.760 --> 2:36:50.000]  want to turn my guns in i saw him taking farmers property environmental groups to turn around
[2:36:50.000 --> 2:36:55.040]  and build on it later i saw a mafia tactics i got angry i decided not to live in a ditch
[2:36:55.040 --> 2:37:02.960]  i decided to stand up i'm not living on my knees folks and i have reached hundreds of millions of
[2:37:02.960 --> 2:37:09.520]  people because of you supporting so we we're in a death battle right now with collectivists who
[2:37:09.520 --> 2:37:15.520]  want to finish the game domesticate america get 60 on welfare get everybody dependent they think
[2:37:15.520 --> 2:37:21.120]  it's game over they think we're done history shows evils always arrogant we have a very good chance
[2:37:21.120 --> 2:37:26.320]  of having a cultural revolution not of communism but of renaissance that will overthrow them now
[2:37:26.320 --> 2:37:30.800]  i'm ranting tucker carlson of dailycaller.com's on but you talk to a guy that's got one of the
[2:37:30.800 --> 2:37:35.440]  biggest news websites out there been successful in mainstream media alternative i'm really landed
[2:37:35.440 --> 2:37:40.240]  on the line here that this is the come to jesus moment for everybody out there listening to do
[2:37:40.240 --> 2:37:45.920]  more to click on our sponsors but to start their own websites to do their own youtube channels to
[2:37:45.920 --> 2:37:51.520]  do their own radio show you can't just count on tucker carlson or joseph ferrer alex jones
[2:37:52.080 --> 2:37:58.960]  or glenn beck you've got to do it tucker you've got the floor well i i mean i completely agree with
[2:37:58.960 --> 2:38:06.240]  that and one of the reasons i'm not a liberal is because i just despise whining and people playing
[2:38:06.240 --> 2:38:11.200]  the victim i really don't like it and i at my worst moments i do it myself and i'm ashamed when i do
[2:38:11.920 --> 2:38:17.680]  but i guess my point is that if you don't like the media as you find them and you shouldn't
[2:38:17.680 --> 2:38:24.960]  because they're pretty bad then you should make a change either read stuff that you think is honest
[2:38:24.960 --> 2:38:29.920]  you know get off the habit break the cycle of dependence on the big three networks on a lot
[2:38:29.920 --> 2:38:36.240]  of the corrupt newspapers that people use to get their news and go find the news sources that are
[2:38:36.240 --> 2:38:41.840]  not lying to you or as you just suggested start your own but do something about it don't be passive
[2:38:41.840 --> 2:38:47.840]  i agree with that absolutely absolutely i mean the shock to me is not that the legacy media
[2:38:47.840 --> 2:38:52.720]  are collapsing of course they are they're terrible and their business model is unsustainable what's
[2:38:52.720 --> 2:38:57.680]  shocking to me is that anybody goes there that anybody's still watching like a today's show
[2:38:57.680 --> 2:39:03.520]  yes it's no longer number one in the morning but it still exists who would watch something like that
[2:39:03.520 --> 2:39:09.520]  i mean it is it's not only propaganda it's stupid and patronizing so what is it of any audience that
[2:39:09.520 --> 2:39:13.040]  that's what i find distressing and i just hope people will move on and go to something new
[2:39:14.320 --> 2:39:17.920]  that's part of my question what i was really getting at is we don't just have the jury box
[2:39:17.920 --> 2:39:24.640]  the grand jury box and the voting box we have voting with our dollars and voting with our action
[2:39:24.640 --> 2:39:30.720]  oh and we're so close that if people out there really start doubling down to educate someone
[2:39:30.720 --> 2:39:35.760]  every week to tell somebody about our websites every day to put us on their facebook or twitter
[2:39:35.760 --> 2:39:42.240]  we're so close they've got zuckerberg and in google and everybody trying to kill the libertarian
[2:39:42.240 --> 2:39:48.160]  upsurge because they know we're coffin nails to their vampiric system we're high noon to count
[2:39:48.160 --> 2:39:56.000]  dracula and and and so folks we're i mean do you agree that it's key for folks to really support
[2:39:56.640 --> 2:40:03.600]  oh absolutely and it's it's key in general to be mindful about where you spend your money
[2:40:03.600 --> 2:40:08.000]  is it consistent with what you believe i don't think you should politicize everything i'm not
[2:40:08.000 --> 2:40:14.080]  every purchase is a political act but i do think it's worth being thoughtful about it absolutely
[2:40:14.080 --> 2:40:19.440]  if i can when i spend my money if i can spend it on something that advances ideas that i believe
[2:40:19.440 --> 2:40:23.600]  i think are true that they make people's lives better i do it i mean i live in the district
[2:40:23.600 --> 2:40:27.920]  of columbia about a hundred yards from the state of maryland there's a gas station right across the
[2:40:27.920 --> 2:40:32.560]  border i don't go there because i don't agree with how the state of maryland is run i probably by
[2:40:32.560 --> 2:40:38.320]  gas cheaper there i don't i don't patronize it because i don't want to give money to people i
[2:40:38.320 --> 2:40:44.800]  disagree with and by contrast like most people i shop at places where i know the ownership and
[2:40:44.800 --> 2:40:48.800]  like them and approve of what they're doing and i don't think your behavior online should be any
[2:40:48.800 --> 2:40:54.080]  different and that's our real power the system is trying to take that away from us if we look at
[2:40:54.080 --> 2:40:58.640]  what obama's doing with cloward and piven they want us to go to the company store they want us to go
[2:40:58.640 --> 2:41:05.200]  to the soviet gulag basically and you know get our sausages and get our nylons uh i just don't
[2:41:05.200 --> 2:41:09.680]  think that's going to work getting back into the election how big a factor do you think election
[2:41:09.680 --> 2:41:15.360]  fraud is going to be with illegals getting caught voting everywhere here is a clip i'm sure you saw
[2:41:15.360 --> 2:41:19.840]  it probably talked about it on fox news i can't say one thing before i forget i love your your
[2:41:19.840 --> 2:41:26.080]  riff on mcdonnell i hate to say that but i i agree with you completely i've never heard anybody say
[2:41:26.080 --> 2:41:30.480]  that before i don't wish i don't listen enough obviously but i totally agree with you well i
[2:41:30.480 --> 2:41:36.320]  mean well thank you but i'm not just picking on them it's just that you know garbage low quality
[2:41:36.320 --> 2:41:42.640]  food we need to just move away from it and i agree let's never thought i i didn't used to agree with
[2:41:42.640 --> 2:41:47.680]  that and i've gotten older and i completely agree with you totally well mcdonnell's didn't eat when
[2:41:47.680 --> 2:41:52.640]  i was a kid mcdonnell's hamburgers were greasy and beef and tasted good now it's like alien martian
[2:41:52.640 --> 2:41:57.040]  food or something i want to play this clip of obama last week where i think he's hinting for
[2:41:57.040 --> 2:42:01.520]  people to vote repeatedly but regardless of that's what he's doing that's what's going on let's play
[2:42:01.520 --> 2:42:08.560]  the clip and because early voting runs through this friday you don't have to wait till election day
[2:42:09.760 --> 2:42:13.600]  you can vote all week i mean you can only vote once
[2:42:13.600 --> 2:42:20.320]  it's in chicago now
[2:42:22.080 --> 2:42:27.120]  i'm teasing chicago i'm messing with you yeah he's messing with us what do you make of that
[2:42:27.120 --> 2:42:30.320]  statement and then what do you make of the real world evidence of fraud coming up
[2:42:31.280 --> 2:42:37.680]  well there's a there's an awful lot of fraud and a lot of it amazingly nobody seems to care about
[2:42:37.680 --> 2:42:42.560]  i mean let me just make the obvious point that there is no justification for opposing voter
[2:42:42.560 --> 2:42:48.800]  id laws except to a bet voter fraud sorry that doesn't make any sense the idea that it's racist to
[2:42:48.800 --> 2:42:53.920]  ask for a driver's license really then driver's licenses themselves are racist they are black
[2:42:53.920 --> 2:42:58.320]  americans can't get access to driver's licenses then why are we requiring one to drive a car i mean
[2:42:58.320 --> 2:43:01.760]  all it doesn't make any sense at all the only reason that you're opposing that is because you
[2:43:01.760 --> 2:43:06.480]  want more fraudulent voting because you know it benefits democrats which does overwhelmingly but
[2:43:06.480 --> 2:43:12.880]  we also know that in the 2000 election hundreds of thousands of non-citizens voted illegally
[2:43:12.880 --> 2:43:18.640]  hundreds of thousand maybe seven hundred thousand voted and so what that's an almost definitive
[2:43:18.640 --> 2:43:23.200]  number i mean that that's high enough you can affect election outcomes so there's no debate
[2:43:23.200 --> 2:43:27.680]  really among people who care enough to learn that it's happening the debate is only between
[2:43:27.680 --> 2:43:34.080]  those who care about it and those who don't what would the democrats do if republicans
[2:43:34.080 --> 2:43:38.720]  started going getting the voter rolls of folks that hadn't voted in a while and and started
[2:43:38.720 --> 2:43:43.600]  going in and voting fraudulently how would they like that see see see why is it and i'm not saying
[2:43:43.600 --> 2:43:48.960]  we should cheat but why isn't the libertarians and conservatives rarely cheat and with democrats
[2:43:48.960 --> 2:43:53.040]  they even have studies on fake environmentalists they're like six times more likely to steal to
[2:43:53.040 --> 2:43:58.080]  not be charitable i'm just so sick of watching them run around and act corrupt while shaking
[2:43:58.080 --> 2:44:04.720]  their finger at us well that's true i mean the moral superiority is a huge part of the liberal
[2:44:04.720 --> 2:44:10.320]  program so the idea is not only to amass power and then wield it in other words get the ability
[2:44:10.320 --> 2:44:14.560]  to tell other people what to do and make them live a certain way but also feel virtuous while
[2:44:14.560 --> 2:44:19.680]  you do it which is that has always been the part of liberalism that makes me sickest the
[2:44:19.680 --> 2:44:24.800]  sanctimony i mean isn't it enough that you're bossing me around making me wear a seatbelt
[2:44:24.800 --> 2:44:30.240]  force me to put out my cigarette taking half of my take home pay in taxes then you have to lecture
[2:44:30.240 --> 2:44:36.320]  me and call me names and say well you're not a working person really because i work it off a lot
[2:44:36.320 --> 2:44:40.800]  like you're lecturing me what is that if let me ask you this doctor carlson of dailycollar.com if
[2:44:40.800 --> 2:44:45.680]  you just joined us what do you make though of jumping the shark in my view obama and now hillary
[2:44:45.680 --> 2:44:49.760]  saying if you have a business you didn't build it and then hillary comes out and says companies
[2:44:49.760 --> 2:44:56.400]  don't create jobs we know that's been disproven she said i mean this is just two plus two equals
[2:44:56.400 --> 2:45:01.680]  three type stuff it's getting so weird you know she hasn't driven a car in 25 years that's a good
[2:45:01.680 --> 2:45:08.720]  point who is totally cut off from the reality of life in america i mean i don't think she has any
[2:45:08.720 --> 2:45:14.000]  idea where jobs come from never having created one i mean she's all about command and control and
[2:45:14.000 --> 2:45:18.400]  by the way not even in an interesting way let's you know in one sentence listen to the next
[2:45:18.400 --> 2:45:23.200]  hillary clinton speech that you can and you'll the first thing i'll notice is how totally banal
[2:45:23.760 --> 2:45:30.080]  she is she sounds like i'm a nixon administration no no i totally i mean i'm interrupting she sounds
[2:45:30.080 --> 2:45:35.440]  like a broken robot or something totally unappealing i mean i don't i think there are a lot worse
[2:45:35.440 --> 2:45:39.120]  people in american politics than hillary like i don't wake up in the middle of night wishing her
[2:45:39.120 --> 2:45:44.240]  ill i don't hate her but she's just not impressive and nobody speaks for herself out loud you know
[2:45:44.240 --> 2:45:48.640]  i think she's pretty tough okay great there are lots of people in this world you know are hard to people
[2:45:48.640 --> 2:45:53.520]  but she's not had original idea ever and i've watched her since i was at the newspaper in
[2:45:53.520 --> 2:45:59.600]  arkansas more than 20 years ago she's just not interesting period well you're a very nice man
[2:45:59.600 --> 2:46:03.920]  to not say that she's a not all i mean that you don't hate her but i mean come on you can say that
[2:46:03.920 --> 2:46:10.800]  a trash can is tough she is just why can't we get rid of clinton's and bushes i mean i totally agree
[2:46:10.800 --> 2:46:15.600]  with her 320 million people in this country let's show me talk about the need for diversity
[2:46:15.600 --> 2:46:20.320]  we're always yapping about diversity but some political diversity i mean i think by the way
[2:46:20.320 --> 2:46:24.240]  the founders were really worried as you know better than anybody they're really on guard against the
[2:46:24.240 --> 2:46:30.000]  very human impulse to worship temporal authority they didn't want a dictator because they knew that
[2:46:30.000 --> 2:46:36.000]  the people in many cases want a dictator they want a king and the founders basically set up all
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:41.360]  assistance prevent us from getting what we really want which was it is a king and we've kind of gone
[2:46:41.360 --> 2:46:46.000]  around all their safeguards and are setting up we're not setting up the king but we're you're
[2:46:46.000 --> 2:46:49.680]  seeing this human impulse at work here we want to keep rewarding people from the same families
[2:46:49.680 --> 2:46:53.920]  why are we doing that well that's like the israelites wanted a king and and god didn't want to give
[2:46:53.920 --> 2:46:58.400]  him one they finally got sold exactly yeah it's it's the same story it just doesn't end well
[2:46:59.120 --> 2:47:03.200]  it's so sad i want to go to a few phone calls here and then after you leave us in overdrive
[2:47:03.200 --> 2:47:06.800]  i'm going to premiere that james o'Keefe piece and then we've got the full interview coming up
[2:47:06.800 --> 2:47:12.160]  tonight but first off mary in pennsylvania you're on the air with tucker carlson go ahead
[2:47:13.680 --> 2:47:18.320]  hey alec i have to apologize because i wanted to part from the topic of the election for a moment
[2:47:18.320 --> 2:47:23.760]  because there's something i've always wanted to ask of tucker carlson and i just wanted to say that
[2:47:23.760 --> 2:47:30.320]  the daily call website is really an aberration and conservative media in terms of uh the disrespect
[2:47:30.320 --> 2:47:34.960]  towards women that it has on its website it's essentially an erase to the bottom with the
[2:47:34.960 --> 2:47:40.880]  left with its policy of contributing to over sexualized atmosphere that we have are you are
[2:47:40.880 --> 2:47:44.880]  ma'am ma'am hold on a minute i mean are you one of these people that thinks they should ban the
[2:47:44.880 --> 2:47:50.080]  statue of the sailor on the victory over japan kissing the woman because they're banning that
[2:47:50.080 --> 2:47:55.440]  everywhere i mean i mean are you joking i don't think anybody accuses daily caller of i think i
[2:47:55.440 --> 2:48:00.080]  think tucker gets accused of being almost too liberal sometimes that you now you're saying he's
[2:48:00.080 --> 2:48:08.160]  attacking women he is being a man period attacking women read article and uh a slice of the sexy girls
[2:48:08.160 --> 2:48:13.600]  and whatever well what's wrong with that well let me just say hold on let me let me just say that i
[2:48:13.600 --> 2:48:18.800]  as the as a man has been married 23 years and has three daughters i i like women better than men
[2:48:18.800 --> 2:48:25.200]  i could say with total sincerity i also believe that beauty is important and we're not embarrassed
[2:48:25.200 --> 2:48:31.760]  to put things that are beautiful not necessarily sexual or debased um but there's nothing wrong
[2:48:31.760 --> 2:48:37.040]  with a woman in a swimsuit and look that's what advertisers have in their ads ma'am are you upset
[2:48:37.040 --> 2:48:42.400]  when you see a woman in a bathing suit on cnn when they're trying to sell products
[2:48:43.760 --> 2:48:48.480]  and and prostituting women out in that way of course now wait a minute wait a minute see that's
[2:48:48.480 --> 2:48:53.200]  words really i would also say whether we do surveys on this if this makes you feel any better our
[2:48:53.200 --> 2:49:01.280]  female readers are some of the biggest consumers of the biggest repeat readers of our slideshows
[2:49:01.280 --> 2:49:08.320]  that oh yeah it's the women that are looking at it come on it's pick up cosmopolitan magazine it's a
[2:49:08.320 --> 2:49:12.640]  it's obviously it's geared toward women and it's filled with pictures of naked women that are much
[2:49:13.200 --> 2:49:16.560]  much saucier than anything you'll find on our site but no we're not embarrassed listen ma'am i
[2:49:16.560 --> 2:49:20.320]  appreciate your call but i'm going to be honest i think that was a seminar caller and i never say
[2:49:20.320 --> 2:49:25.760]  that but i really do think that was just a cheap shot by some writer it was pretty funny well but
[2:49:25.760 --> 2:49:32.080]  i mean give me a break you guys have occasional slides on the sides of like you know uh a woman
[2:49:32.080 --> 2:49:39.280]  on a surfboard or something i mean i'm just notice how the left is is like a cult though like we're
[2:49:39.280 --> 2:49:44.400]  in some some some weird cult we're about to be burned at the stake because you have maryland
[2:49:44.400 --> 2:49:48.800]  roe on your website well they're all very uptight i mean for example i mean you know we're happy to
[2:49:48.800 --> 2:49:55.120]  do a slideshow on the women of the idf for example because it's hilarious and it's funny and interesting
[2:49:55.120 --> 2:50:01.040]  and whatever we mean it in a very lighthearted way there's nothing serious or creepy about it at all
[2:50:01.040 --> 2:50:08.320]  and and i just don't believe that things that are meant in good faith and as but that that are funny
[2:50:08.320 --> 2:50:13.120]  are offensive by the way i have looked at the slideshow of the women of the idf and think that
[2:50:13.120 --> 2:50:17.360]  you know that they're very nice looking i mean i mean what's wrong with that it certainly are
[2:50:17.360 --> 2:50:23.680]  it's awesome and it's funny i mean it's a riot so every every young kapor we do an idf slideshow
[2:50:23.680 --> 2:50:27.440]  and it makes me laugh every every year just you know offended by it i think they're in a small
[2:50:27.440 --> 2:50:31.440]  minority and i'm yeah lady i don't think you're a regular listener i think that was we got more
[2:50:31.440 --> 2:50:37.920]  tucker girls in questions ahead uh preacher in texas wants to talk to him just don't show slideshows
[2:50:37.920 --> 2:50:44.320]  of guys in underwear don't show that now that i agree is sexist and i'm against it never do that
[2:50:44.320 --> 2:50:50.800]  ever don't tuck her or i'm gonna quit reading it i i want to see i mean it's it's that's what i like
[2:50:50.800 --> 2:50:55.840]  though i like maryland and roe women in bathing suits there's nothing wrong with celebrating

[2:53:17.840 --> 2:53:23.360]  even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation or that the dollar wouldn't lose

[2:54:53.200 --> 2:54:57.920]  com tucker carlson i want to take a few final calls from preacher uh cori and a couple others
[2:54:57.920 --> 2:55:03.360]  that are holding are not cori whoever's next up but do you think the republicans will take the senate
[2:55:03.360 --> 2:55:09.440]  a and b do you think they'll then try to reverse obama care and c will they get removed from office
[2:55:09.440 --> 2:55:14.720]  if they don't reverse obama care um those are the that is exactly the sequence of events that's
[2:55:14.720 --> 2:55:20.160]  most likely to occur uh a i'm not sure i think of course the odds are in favor of the republicans
[2:55:20.160 --> 2:55:27.040]  taking the senate's night um or in january when the recount in georgia is done um but i'm not you
[2:55:27.040 --> 2:55:32.560]  know i wouldn't bet that my house on it actually um i think it's the numbers are pretty really
[2:55:32.560 --> 2:55:36.880]  confusing but yeah if i had to bet i guess i would bet a limited amount of money that they'll win
[2:55:36.880 --> 2:55:42.640]  no they will not try will return obama care um because they don't think they can and they don't
[2:55:42.640 --> 2:55:47.920]  think that it's politically popular to do so and they won't and yes they will wind up disappointing
[2:55:47.920 --> 2:55:55.440]  a lot of their voters because they always do but people are getting fed up with them i i see a tea
[2:55:55.440 --> 2:56:01.360]  party takeover of the republicans if they don't change over to our way which is just basic survival
[2:56:01.360 --> 2:56:07.600]  yeah i mean look candidates who i mean the most popular senator in the united states there's only
[2:56:07.600 --> 2:56:12.960]  one senator right now who's running unopposed and that's jeff sessions of alabama and jeff
[2:56:12.960 --> 2:56:17.920]  sessions is not a good speaker jeff sessions is not super charismatic he doesn't pander to people
[2:56:17.920 --> 2:56:21.680]  the only reason jeff sessions is truly the most popular person in the state of alabama
[2:56:21.680 --> 2:56:25.840]  is because he's really principled he says exactly what he thinks he doesn't lie and people like that
[2:56:25.840 --> 2:56:29.520]  i think there's a market for that i actually think you can get elected and keep your job
[2:56:29.520 --> 2:56:36.640]  if you are an honest man look at ron paul another example exactly exactly talk about a guy i mean
[2:56:36.640 --> 2:56:42.800]  i've been a lot of ron paul speeches ron paul is one of the least inspiring speakers ever and yet
[2:56:42.800 --> 2:56:47.520]  he inspires all these people well i could you know when ron paul talks with you agree or not
[2:56:47.520 --> 2:56:54.160]  he's being totally sincere integrity integrity let's talk to preacher uh in texas go out here
[2:56:54.160 --> 2:56:58.560]  with tucker carlson hello alex first of all i want to thank you for all you do to get the
[2:56:58.560 --> 2:57:06.080]  information out to take down uh these people who are trying to oppress us second uh tucker i am a
[2:57:06.080 --> 2:57:12.640]  follower of yours on daily caller and i appreciate the work you do on uh fox news oh thanks a lot
[2:57:12.640 --> 2:57:17.840]  i didn't uh yeah hey i wanted to bring up a story that you put out on daily caller today i thought
[2:57:17.840 --> 2:57:23.680]  was pretty interesting that kind of shows the racism of the obama family and that's michelle
[2:57:23.680 --> 2:57:29.040]  going out and telling voters to go vote democrat and then go have a piece of fried chicken now is
[2:57:29.040 --> 2:57:35.440]  that not racist well i don't know what the hell she was talking about i mean that first of all i
[2:57:35.440 --> 2:57:41.840]  mean it's it it sounds like part of a stereotypically joke a b isn't that a direct violation of her
[2:57:42.400 --> 2:57:48.160]  eat kale for breakfast program or something every time i see her she's like eating the most
[2:57:48.160 --> 2:57:54.720]  fattening foods and then the stuff she wants our kids to eat looks like rat feet or something so i
[2:57:54.720 --> 2:58:00.320]  don't i mean i couldn't even begin to decode what she said i will say my one sentence on michelle
[2:58:00.320 --> 2:58:05.280]  obama i've been thinking about all day is here she's campaigning much more than barack obama
[2:58:05.280 --> 2:58:09.200]  but you're not allowed to criticize her she's a full-on political figure used by the democratic
[2:58:09.200 --> 2:58:13.040]  party to get votes for their candidates sure but it's somehow out of bounds for you to say well
[2:58:13.040 --> 2:58:17.760]  that's like saying you know she's a woman and she's black so it's a double and they run hillary
[2:58:17.760 --> 2:58:22.080]  oh now you're against women and i think that woman earlier is mad that two men you and your
[2:58:22.080 --> 2:58:26.080]  former college roommate own it i think that's why they're mad because all the feminist groups don't
[2:58:26.080 --> 2:58:30.880]  get mad when they have women in bikinis it's a man owns something and has a woman on a bikini
[2:58:30.880 --> 2:58:35.760]  tucker carlsondailycaller.com thank you so much for the time thanks Alex that was great thank you

[2:59:56.240 --> 3:00:01.360]  and here's our interview more we're coming up tonight with james ho keef of project veritas
[3:00:01.360 --> 3:00:06.080]  tell us where you are what was going on and what led you to uh to this particular report
[3:00:06.080 --> 3:00:11.920]  we're in the area surrounding raleigh durham north carolina and we walked into these pole
[3:00:11.920 --> 3:00:18.320]  pole precinct locations and simply said the names of inactive voters and they told us they
[3:00:18.320 --> 3:00:24.800]  offered us ballots we did this a total of about 20 times and everyone offered us a ballot except
[3:00:24.800 --> 3:00:29.680]  one and that person asked to see my driver's license which is against the rules you're not
[3:00:29.680 --> 3:00:35.600]  allowed to ask for id but when they did ask for id i was unable to get a ballot i was unable to get
[3:00:35.600 --> 3:00:41.200]  someone else's ballot so we demonstrated that in-person voter fraud is possible this comes on
[3:00:41.200 --> 3:00:45.840]  the heels of a report we did last week where a worker was fired a campaign worker was fired
[3:00:46.560 --> 3:00:52.000]  for telling us to vote for non-citizens and this comes two weeks after in colorado a worker was
[3:00:52.000 --> 3:00:58.160]  fired for telling us to go dumpster diving for ballots of african americans to vote in their
[3:00:58.160 --> 3:01:03.440]  names so we really have done a big series on voter fraud and it's having an impact on these races
[3:01:03.440 --> 3:01:07.920]  but you demonstrated perfectly you can go vote as people who are even deceased is that correct
[3:01:07.920 --> 3:01:12.720]  yeah i mean anyone whose name is on the rolls you could walk right up to the
[3:01:13.440 --> 3:01:17.840]  pole location state their name state their address and you can get offered their ballot
[3:01:17.840 --> 3:01:22.960]  you just have to sign the form we didn't actually sign any forms because that would be a felony
[3:01:22.960 --> 3:01:28.640]  but it is possible there's 700 000 inactive voters there's over a thousand people in north
[3:01:28.640 --> 3:01:34.960]  carolina who are registered to vote who are non-citizens so this stuff is entirely possible
[3:01:34.960 --> 3:01:39.840]  and the elections are so close it could make a difference and when we talk about this voter
[3:01:39.840 --> 3:01:43.600]  fraud it doesn't even have to be somebody who's necessarily not going to vote could it just be
[3:01:43.600 --> 3:01:48.960]  a circumstance where you get to the polls before they do very very well could be and many people
[3:01:48.960 --> 3:01:55.920]  don't vote you know in colorado and the mail-in ballots you know the almost half or one-third
[3:01:55.920 --> 3:02:01.120]  of those ballots are thrown away or discarded and one of the officials in the video says yeah you
[3:02:01.120 --> 3:02:05.520]  should go fill those ballots out filling those mail-in ballots all you got to do is checkmark
[3:02:05.520 --> 3:02:10.080]  someone's name and forge their signature and you can and congratulations you're voting on
[3:02:10.080 --> 3:02:15.440]  somebody else's name so it's it's possible the board of elections is now investigating
[3:02:16.080 --> 3:02:21.120]  it's really a simple ruse we've done it before we got offered eric holder's ballot two years ago
[3:02:21.120 --> 3:02:25.760]  we went into eric holders precinct and walked right up to the attorney general where he votes
[3:02:25.760 --> 3:02:30.800]  and the poll worker said here you go mr holder and of course we weren't eric holder but they
[3:02:30.800 --> 3:02:36.240]  assumed we were because there's no photo ID and then after we did this they actually had a picture
[3:02:36.240 --> 3:02:43.280]  of eric holder put on his poll okay are you serious so they they verified identity for
[3:02:43.280 --> 3:02:47.520]  eric holder but nobody else yeah i remember that one you guys like i'll be back faster than you
[3:02:47.520 --> 3:02:52.080]  could say furious but you know it just shows how easy this thing is to manipulate and people would
[3:02:52.080 --> 3:02:55.840]  say you know that they try to criticize that well you're showing people how to illegally vote these
[3:02:55.840 --> 3:03:00.240]  people already know if they want to participate in these actions how to do it because you don't in
[3:03:00.240 --> 3:03:05.280]  the jurisdictions you're going to you don't need a voter ID like you do here in the state of texas
[3:03:05.280 --> 3:03:10.560]  so let me ask you this at any point what surprised you the most was there a situation you said well
[3:03:10.560 --> 3:03:14.640]  no we're not going to get away with it this time or just something happened that you didn't expect
[3:03:14.640 --> 3:03:20.800]  to happen at all well the the shock was you know there's a couple funny anecdotes um one time i was
[3:03:20.800 --> 3:03:26.880]  i was doing this in one of the areas and i believe it was Durham uh or carrie north carolina and i
[3:03:26.880 --> 3:03:32.800]  was standing right in front of a sheriff or a police officer and he stood there right behind
[3:03:32.800 --> 3:03:37.920]  me as i was doing this ruse of course i wasn't breaking any laws but there's always the presumption
[3:03:37.920 --> 3:03:42.800]  they arrest you and ask questions later and the police officer had his hands on the side of his
[3:03:42.800 --> 3:03:47.360]  body and he was it looked like i i basically said to myself i'm pretty much screwed he's
[3:03:47.360 --> 3:03:52.800]  gonna arrest me the moment i turn around so i turn around i get offered this ballot and i say well
[3:03:52.800 --> 3:03:57.200]  let me go out to the car and i'll be back that was my excuse for getting out of the location
[3:03:57.200 --> 3:04:02.000]  and the officer looks at me and i'm expecting him to put handcuffs he literally just walked right by
[3:04:02.000 --> 3:04:07.440]  me and said you know he just said hey he was voting i thought he was there to you know stop me
[3:04:07.440 --> 3:04:11.200]  from doing this ruse but he was just there as a police officer voting there was another anecdote
[3:04:11.200 --> 3:04:15.360]  where the woman in the video actually does say i need to see your driver's license and i did not
[3:04:15.360 --> 3:04:21.680]  expect that that was the one thing i did not expect was for them to break the rules and do the right
[3:04:21.680 --> 3:04:26.000]  thing even though it was against the rules and that's what stopped me from being able to get
[3:04:26.000 --> 3:04:29.920]  offered the ballot was when she asked me for my id what's the rule that she broke that just simply
[3:04:29.920 --> 3:04:37.840]  asking for a photo id in in north carolina in 2014 you do not need to show a driver's license and
[3:04:37.840 --> 3:04:42.320]  in some of the cases when we said oh you know i would say oh do you need to see my driver's license
[3:04:42.320 --> 3:04:47.680]  they would almost like when you show garlic to a vampire they would they would jump back and say no
[3:04:47.680 --> 3:04:52.800]  no no no no i don't i don't i can't see your id i can't see your id so the notion that someone
[3:04:52.800 --> 3:05:18.800]  actually asked for id id is is wrong when in the state of north carolina you're not allowed to do that
