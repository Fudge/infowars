[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.360]  If you think what's happening to Alex Jones is bad, or if you think what's happening to
[00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:13.360]  own Troyer is bad, or what's happening to Russell Brand is bad, just wait till you see what
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.440]  they do to your neighbor.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.000]  Because they start with the influencers to set an example.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.680]  They get real frustrated when Alex says something more than when your neighbor says
[00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:23.840]  something because Alex has millions upon millions of listeners, so they're going to go after
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:24.840]  him first.
[00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.800]  But it's not going to stop there, folks.
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.240]  When Trump said, it's not me thereafter, it's you, I'm just in the way, that was perhaps
[00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.920]  the most true political statement, political slogan in the history of political slogans
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:37.800]  in the United States of America.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.680]  And they are coming after you.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:43.840]  And that's why it's more important than ever to fight back and to speak out, because
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:48.000]  cowardice is exploited, so don't be a coward.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.680]  The first step to non-compliance is speaking out.

[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:10.720]  It's Monday, September 18th, 2023.
[00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.360]  I'm your host, Alex Jones, and what you just saw and heard, Chase Geysers say last
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:20.480]  night on the Sunday broadcast is absolutely central to saving our country and the world
[00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:21.480]  right now.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.240]  It's the fact that the globalists aren't coming after Tucker Carlson and Donald Trump
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.780]  and Russell Brand and Alex Jones.
[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.640]  They're coming after you.
[00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:36.280]  They're coming after your rights, your freedoms, your wealth.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.600]  They're closing the door on upper mobility in the first world because they can't have
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.840]  an example of an open, free society to the rest of the world that they've already enslaved.
[00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.280]  They can't have the Communist Chinese aspire to get out of that system.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.080]  They can't have poor Africans aspire to own a car out of air conditioning.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.220]  Obama told them that before he left office, you can't have cars with air conditioning.
[00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.440]  You can't have children.
[00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.160]  The world will overeat your bad, but Obama can have his big oceanfront property and
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.160]  his mansions in Hawaii and Massachusetts and his private jets.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:17.120]  So it's central to understanding the situation we're into to admit we're in a war.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:26.140]  And that war, that deindustrialization program, that rewilding program, that post enlightenment
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:33.800]  system has gone from its testing phases to its operational phase, as I've said many
[00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:34.800]  times.
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.880]  And that's why it's very important to understand that a lot of really smart analysts that
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.040]  I respect concur with my own breakdown.
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.720]  And that's that they are bringing in a permanent emergency, the COVID emergency, the climate
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:58.760]  emergency, the violence crime emergency, gun emergency, that the system exacerbates
[00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:04.560]  in every way they can every day with the Soros DAs here in the US, but also
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.320]  similarly in Europe that don't prosecute rapists and murderers, not to mention people
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.240]  looting stores.
[00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:18.680]  All this is designed to create a feeling of desperation and hopelessness and demoralization
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:23.320]  to make us lay down and roll over and accept the great reset and the build back
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:31.560]  better program where they erase the old economy in a giant cloud pivot exercise of
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:32.560]  demolition.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.320]  And then they bring in the world social credit score, the central bank digital currencies,
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:43.720]  the programmable money in their own words that is here and being rolled out this year
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:45.600]  and next year around the world.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.760]  And then if you behave yourself, you get a universal basic income.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:53.800]  But again, you can only buy with that what they want.
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.580]  Can't buy a car, but you can ride a bus for now.
[00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:58.580]  Can't get steak.
[00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:59.580]  Can't get chicken.
[00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:00.580]  Can't get fish.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.380]  Can't get cricket protein.
[00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:09.480]  This is a totally managed technocracy economy in their own words where they control every
[00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:10.700]  aspect of your life.
[00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:17.760]  This is dystopia being sold as the solution to the hell they're creating.
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.260]  But the artificial dystopia they're making can be easily reversed and fixed as long
[00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:25.760]  as too much of the infrastructure isn't destroyed.
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:30.200]  But that's why through devaluation of currencies and through open borders and human smuggling
[00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.980]  and regulations to cut off the energy and all the mysterious fires in the Western world
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:40.740]  and explosions destroying infrastructure, destroying food processing plants and all the arson
[00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.020]  where they catch leftist environmentalist setting and all over the Western world.
[00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.540]  All of that is bringing in the perfect storm of control.
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:50.300]  So when we come back, I'm going to break it all down.
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.700]  This is beyond critical.
[00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:52.700]  Please spread the word.

[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.680]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:22.320]  It's Monday, September 18th, 2023, and Fox News is now reporting on a story that
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.060]  could bring down the entire new world order globalist system.
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:35.220]  It's on national Fox News, but it first broke on local Fox News in Missouri.
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:42.040]  We're going to be playing these newscasts coming up here in just a few minutes.
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.940]  Now the first thing I want to say about this is very important.
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:54.820]  We already reported on this in my earlier documentaries more than 20 years ago, but it's
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:03.900]  just now 50 plus years later that they are declassifying the full extent of what they've
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:10.540]  done and now investigative reporters are digging into the national archives in different
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:21.460]  cities around the country and discovering that in every major city in the predominantly
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:27.340]  black but also they would hit areas in the Appalachians as well.
[00:07:27.340 --> 00:07:35.260]  They didn't care as long as you were poor with radioactive dust and other deadly chemicals
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:45.260]  sprayed by airplanes, sprayed by trucks and sprayed out of exhaust systems set up
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:49.860]  on the roofs of buildings that look like it's just the exhaust from a furnace or something
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:50.860]  like that.
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:58.500]  And instead it sprays deadly radioactive isotope on you that gives you lung and bone cancer
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.780]  within just a few years.
[00:08:00.780 --> 00:08:06.460]  Now this is only one project that's been declassified.
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:13.240]  They released bioweapons in the New York subway in the 1950s, 60s, and 70s.
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.300]  That's been declassified, the CIA did.
[00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:23.140]  There are literally thousands of these programs that I personally know about from the national
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:27.460]  archives that I've seen reported on over the years and it's not just in the US.
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:33.740]  They did it in the UK, they did it in Israel, they did it in the continent of Europe, anywhere
[00:08:33.740 --> 00:08:40.460]  that the Bilderberg Group, Anglo-American globalist power block is in control.
[00:08:40.460 --> 00:08:47.980]  They've tested everything from anthrax on the public, radioactive isotopes, syphilis,
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:56.000]  weaponized syphilis, of course the souped up version of Lyme's disease developed at
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:59.280]  Plum Island off the coast of New York by the US military.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.280]  That was released against the public.
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:13.120]  But let's just drill into the one case over a decade they're declassifying in the 1950s
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:16.640]  in St. Louis, Missouri.
[00:09:16.640 --> 00:09:21.920]  Because as Stalin said, one man dies is a tragedy, 10,000 dies is a statistic.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:25.160]  But there is no doubt that every one of you listening today, whether you're black,
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:30.680]  white, Hispanic, old, young, you had family members or perhaps even you that were hit
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:31.680]  by this.
[00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:35.160]  Now, why is this so important?
[00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:36.900]  Congress didn't know about this.
[00:09:36.900 --> 00:09:38.840]  The Senate didn't know about this.
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:42.480]  This was all hidden under the National Security Act of 1947.
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:49.080]  This is a mad scientist, eugenics cult that has been in control of our main universities
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:53.960]  and in control of the leadership of the intelligence agencies and shadow government
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:57.360]  at least since 1947.
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:02.140]  And they believe there's too many people and they want to be able to play God.
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:06.720]  And they want to be able to also do these tests everywhere to have larger and larger
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:13.760]  teams of people that work for the system who will then go out and carry out these
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:18.160]  lethal murderous operations against the people.
[00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:22.280]  So they have a larger army in the future that's been compromised that they can trust.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:27.440]  And that's what the poison prion COVID shot is about.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:32.680]  Is about getting a wider group now of doctors and scientists and lawyers and nurses and
[00:10:32.680 --> 00:10:37.800]  people that went along with it, the roll out of the lies, then they discover it's
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:42.880]  a fraud and still defend the fraud they believe to cover their butts.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:51.400]  And now you've corrupted a larger concentric ring around that and expanded the base of
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:57.840]  people that will carry out any operation you want at any time.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.640]  And that's how this system operates.
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.000]  I've told you this many times, I'm explaining it again.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:07.760]  My father was top of his class when he was 14, he got recruited, he bought into
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:13.440]  NASA and he was at UT at plan two.
[00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:19.360]  This is in the mid 1960s and then discovered very quickly that they were basically training
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:22.320]  people to carry out mad scientist operations.
[00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:29.680]  He was 15 years old at the cancer research facility in Houston, MD Anderson there when
[00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:34.480]  they were doing all sorts of secret experiments on people that had cancer that was lethal.
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:37.600]  Now that's when my dad's 15.
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:40.200]  He got out of it by the time he was 20.
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:44.280]  But just to understand ladies and gentlemen, that's how big this is.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:48.440]  They've recruited millions and millions and millions of people into it.
[00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:54.520]  Peter Fauci giving mainly little black kids deadly HIV drugs in the 80s and 90s used to
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:57.040]  be a big story.
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.080]  These people mean business and they want to be able to play God.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:07.040]  So right now, let's go to the local Fox newscast talking about this.
[00:12:07.040 --> 00:12:12.360]  The full story is on info wars.com and I'm going to come back and tie it into the
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.560]  globalist going from beta because you think all this mass murder is bad.
[00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:22.760]  This is just a test into operational, the geoengineering, the 5G, the poison shots, the
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:24.640]  GMO food, the nanotech.
[00:12:24.640 --> 00:12:25.640]  It's all here.
[00:12:25.640 --> 00:12:29.200]  Here's a local report from local Fox.
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.960]  This next story is so unbelievable, we didn't think it could possibly be true, but after
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:39.160]  receiving thousands of records and declassified reports from the army, it's confirmed that
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:44.760]  during the cold war, the United States military conducted secret tests on unsuspecting
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.760]  people in the city of St. Louis.
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:51.480]  A local sociologist will make her findings public tomorrow, but she spoke first to the
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:54.880]  I team's Lisa Zignin.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:59.960]  Lisa Martino-Taylor's life work has been to uncover details of the army's ultra-secret
[00:12:59.960 --> 00:13:06.160]  military experiments carried out in St. Louis and other cities during the 1950s and 60s.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:08.800]  This study was secretive for a reason.
[00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:14.360]  They didn't have volunteers stepping up and saying, yeah, I'll breathe zinc cadmium
[00:13:14.360 --> 00:13:17.200]  sulfide with radioactive particles.
[00:13:17.200 --> 00:13:21.800]  These army archive pictures show how the tests were done in Corpus Christi, Texas in the
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.800]  1960s.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.720]  In Texas, planes were used to drop the chemical, but in St. Louis, the army placed chemical
[00:13:27.720 --> 00:13:30.920]  sprayers on buildings and station wagons.
[00:13:30.920 --> 00:13:33.920]  City officials were kept in the dark about the tests.
[00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:38.500]  The cold war cover story was that the army was testing smoke screens to protect
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:40.940]  cities from a Russian attack.
[00:13:40.940 --> 00:13:44.860]  The truth, according to Martino-Taylor, was much more sinister.
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:53.700]  It's pretty shocking, the level of duplicity and secrecy, clearly they went to great lengths
[00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:55.260]  to deceive people.
[00:13:55.260 --> 00:14:00.240]  By making hundreds of Freedom of Information Act requests, she uncovered once classified
[00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.980]  documents that confirmed the spraying of zinc cadmium sulfide.
[00:14:04.980 --> 00:14:08.980]  The greatest concentration of this compound was sprayed near the Pruitt-Igoe housing
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:11.860]  complex just south of downtown St. Louis.
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:18.080]  It was home to 10,000 low income people and an estimated 70 percent were under the
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:19.880]  age of 12.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:25.540]  Martino-Taylor claims they all unknowingly inhaled this compound morning, noon and night
[00:14:25.540 --> 00:14:28.880]  so the government could measure its effects on their lungs.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:33.520]  So this is in violation of all medical ethics, all international codes and the military's
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.760]  own policy at that time.
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:41.320]  In 1994, then-Congressman Richard Gephardt asked the army to open its records and explain
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:42.720]  the St. Louis testing.
[00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:47.360]  We want to make very sure that nothing went on that would harm anyone and that
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.000]  all the facts are out on the table.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:53.800]  Documents released in the 90s show the army placed sprayers on this former Knights of
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.480]  Columbus building on Lindell and in Forest Park.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:03.440]  The army always insisted the chemical compound was safe, Martino-Taylor believes documents
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.440]  prove otherwise.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:09.640]  There's a lot of evidence that indicates that people in St. Louis and the city, particularly
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:17.800]  in minority communities, were subjected to military tests that was connected to a larger
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:21.200]  radiological weapons development and testing project.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:26.680]  For the first time, she links the St. Louis testing to a company called U.S. Radium,
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:32.440]  a company notorious for lawsuits involving radioactive contamination of its workers.
[00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:39.200]  The United States Radium had this reputation where they had been legally liable, found
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:47.080]  legally liable decades prior for producing a radioactive powdered paint that killed many
[00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:50.760]  young women who painted fluorescent watch tiles.
[00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:55.960]  While the army admits it added a fluorescent substance to the zinc-cadmium compound, details
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:00.360]  of whether it was radioactive remain secret.
[00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:05.520]  Documents uncovered to date indicate the army never conducted follow-up studies to see whether
[00:16:05.520 --> 00:16:09.160]  the compound caused long-term health issues.
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:16.600]  In 1972, after years of crime, poverty, and decline, the government destroyed the
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.600]  Pruitt-Igoe housing complex.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:23.280]  Lisa Zigman, News Channel 5, I-Team.
[00:16:23.280 --> 00:16:28.400]  Now the company U.S. Radium no longer exists, Martino-Taylor has placed all of her research,
[00:16:28.400 --> 00:16:34.360]  including the declassified documents, online and will link you to that data at ksdk.com.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:38.400]  Now she will make all of her findings public tomorrow at St. Louis Community College
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.960]  Merrimack Campus.
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:44.560]  In the meantime, if you remember the spring, the I-Team's Lisa Zigman would like to hear
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:45.560]  from you.
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:50.560]  You can email her at lzigman at ksdk.com.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:55.160]  Now remember, this is just a local news report.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:16:59.920]  There's also a national Fox News report.
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:06.920]  And when you read the report, they are basically giving you nothing more than a whitewash.
[00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.600]  It's far worse than this.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:14.200]  Oh, they told local officials that they were just, you know, blowing a smoke.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.320]  It's no big deal.
[00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:19.160]  Local officials told them it was just trucks that were doing it.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:29.000]  But a young lady remembers out on the baseball field playing baseball and over her flew a
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:34.880]  squadron of six green jets that sprayed them with a powder.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:36.360]  She went in and washed it off.
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:43.440]  And of course, she then got cancer four times and most her siblings died of cancer.
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:46.600]  And her daddy died as well.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.980]  Right after she was born.
[00:17:47.980 --> 00:17:49.580]  This is just one family.
[00:17:49.580 --> 00:17:54.740]  This is, this is who the psychotics are that are basically in full control of our government
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.520]  at this point.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:00.220]  So when they tell you, they're giving you a quote shot, so you don't get COVID.
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:03.880]  And then now they tell you a few years later, actually, you've had the shot, you're
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:06.620]  not protected, you need more shots.
[00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:10.140]  They're just hoping you don't go read the mainline studies showing that if you've had
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:14.660]  the shot, you're more likely to get sick and die, not just to COVID, but of any
[00:18:14.660 --> 00:18:16.220]  other virus.
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.820]  So they've done it to us.
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:19.820]  They've rolled their operation out.
[00:18:19.820 --> 00:18:22.220]  And what does that really signify?
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:24.580]  These people are at war with us.
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.860]  And they're going all the way.
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:30.340]  But the most important thing to understand is, they're not just going to kill poor
[00:18:30.340 --> 00:18:34.820]  white people or black people, which is bad.
[00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:40.700]  Anyone serving the system should be smart enough to know you're not going to be exempt
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:42.900]  from something this massive.
[00:18:42.900 --> 00:18:48.660]  And of course, now they can use drones, drone helicopters, you name it, to deliver these
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.540]  compounds onto the population.
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:57.500]  And the people running the show are the Bill Gates's and Anthony Fauci's of the world.
[00:18:57.500 --> 00:18:59.620]  That's the reality.
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:04.940]  And so I'm glad this report came out because it just reminded me that what's old is
[00:19:04.940 --> 00:19:05.940]  new.
[00:19:05.940 --> 00:19:11.660]  We should really every week go back and just look at the different partially declassified
[00:19:11.660 --> 00:19:18.380]  admissions of this being done in Dallas, Texas, or Albuquerque, New Mexico, or Los Angeles,
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:26.220]  California, or Miami, Florida, or New York City, or you name it, every major town,
[00:19:26.220 --> 00:19:31.100]  every major city, many rural areas, this has been done everywhere.
[00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:35.540]  And not just with these poison chemicals and radioactive powders.
[00:19:35.540 --> 00:19:37.380]  God knows what they're doing now.
[00:19:37.380 --> 00:19:39.060]  We've got a good idea.
[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.580]  We see live expectancy dropping.
[00:19:40.580 --> 00:19:42.500]  We see all the new diseases.
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:44.700]  Now they're saying young people get Alzheimer's.
[00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:48.140]  No ladies and gentlemen, we're being soft killed.
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:49.180]  It's happening.
[00:19:49.180 --> 00:19:51.140]  We're living inside the new world order.
[00:19:51.140 --> 00:19:55.340]  Now let's look at how this very establishment that's done all this is about to bring in
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:59.900]  the permanent emergency and how we can hopefully stop it if we admit the full horror of what
[00:19:59.900 --> 00:20:00.900]  we're facing.
[00:20:00.900 --> 00:20:04.980]  But please, once this live report is archived, it banned out video, which will be just
[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:05.980]  a few hours.
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:17.260]  Remember how we began this first hour today with the statement that Trump has made a thousand
[00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.100]  times is totally true.
[00:20:19.100 --> 00:20:21.100]  They're not coming after him.
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.500]  He's just in the way they're coming after you.
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:26.120]  They're coming after everybody.
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:31.740]  They don't want there to be an upwardly mobile, empowered country that can be an example
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:37.140]  to others living under tyranny for the new world order to be able to take over our Republic
[00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:39.140]  and the Western world must be destroyed.
[00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:46.940]  And that's why there's an organized corporate military intelligence agency attack on that.
[00:20:46.940 --> 00:20:51.740]  Now talking to a lot of people, I really respect like Jack Pacific, one of the smartest
[00:20:51.740 --> 00:20:55.140]  people out there when it comes to analyzing the big picture.
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:56.940]  And I totally agree with him.
[00:20:56.940 --> 00:21:00.500]  The globalists are preparing us for a permanent emergency, not just a climate emergency, not
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:06.220]  just a gun violence emergency, not just an open border emergency, not just a defund
[00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:10.880]  the police crime explosion emergency, but a currency emergency.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:12.580]  They have to bring down the old system.
[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:17.820]  They have to pose as the savior to bring in the new world currency that tracks and
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:19.780]  controls everything we do.
[00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:24.800]  And this isn't Patriots telling us about this coming 20 years ago who were right.
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:27.580]  This is happening now.
[00:21:27.580 --> 00:21:34.780]  And they're getting us ready with this escalation with Russia next year to perhaps even cancel
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:35.940]  the election.
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:40.620]  I think that clearly that's in the cards, but regardless, assassinations of Trump are
[00:21:40.620 --> 00:21:44.460]  on the table by the deep state assassinations of Biden are on the table.
[00:21:44.460 --> 00:21:52.620]  Again to blame the populist movement, massive false flag attacks, racial false flag attacks.
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:54.940]  They're activating their fed controlled Nazi groups.
[00:21:54.940 --> 00:21:56.820]  You see them everywhere.
[00:21:56.820 --> 00:22:02.060]  This is the time to be absolutely focused because all the previous evil we've seen is
[00:22:02.060 --> 00:22:03.380]  just the prep.
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:07.060]  But here's the good news over a month ago, I got the Intel that were planning to
[00:22:07.060 --> 00:22:13.060]  roll back out the COVID hysteria and now they've begun to roll it out.
[00:22:13.060 --> 00:22:15.640]  It's formed a massive opposition to it.
[00:22:15.640 --> 00:22:20.500]  So if we can get ahead of this and really get people aware of what's happening, the
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:21.980]  globalists won't be able to pull it off.
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:26.780]  They need the general public and most of Congress, who isn't part of it, to be unaware.
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:29.900]  But we're seeing more and more senators, more and more governors, more and more attorney
[00:22:29.900 --> 00:22:35.140]  generals come out against the globalists and point out they're setting up a dictatorship,
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:41.900]  one party, not just oligarchy, but more of a plutocracy.
[00:22:41.900 --> 00:22:45.260]  And later in the broadcast and over the next few days, I'll explain the different
[00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:49.700]  definitions that the globalists under their philosophy operate under.
[00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:55.020]  You got the tyrant system, you have the aristocracy system, you have plutocracy.
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:23:02.220]  And then of course, you have mad rule of the mob, which they call pure democracy.
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:04.980]  And these are their definitions.
[00:23:04.980 --> 00:23:12.380]  We'll be laying it all out, but we see huge COVID roll out.
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:14.660]  And that's because we got ahead of it.
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.640]  And we've got to get ahead of this.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:22.240]  We also see the spokesperson for the Ukrainian military saying they're going to launch terror
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:26.120]  attacks all over the world against anybody that's anti-World War III.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:31.960]  But now US senators are calling for major investigations, including criminal investigation
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:37.040]  to see if national security information is being given to the Ukrainians and if indeed
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:41.520]  it's being used to target people that are dissidents, not just here, but around
[00:23:41.520 --> 00:23:42.520]  the world.
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:48.280]  And they're definitely preparing Ukrainian sleeper cells to stage false flags here and
[00:23:48.280 --> 00:23:52.880]  in Europe to be blamed on their political enemies.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:24:00.400]  Now continuing, this whole thing has been set in motion and the only way they can
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:05.080]  get away with this is if we don't realize that we're in a war.
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:10.740]  But if we realize that we're in a war and if we mobilize and organize against it and
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:15.500]  people understand the type of war we're facing, we have a very good chance of stopping
[00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:19.580]  this because they can, again, only get away with it if the public is politically ignorant
[00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:20.580]  to how this operates.
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:25.380]  Now, Owen Schroyer is going to be sitting in in the next few days, but I'll be here
[00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:28.540]  following audio and video reports as well.
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:32.500]  He's got a ton of critical info he's going to be laying out.
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:36.740]  But without me even hammering it, and we have been talking about it a lot, but without
[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:42.900]  me even hammering it, a lot of other major influencers who are very smart, like Jack
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:46.620]  Vacevic and Steve Bannon and many others are warning that they're planning to try
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:48.340]  to cancel the election.
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:51.300]  They're planning to outlaw their political opposition.
[00:24:51.300 --> 00:24:55.060]  They are really, really mobilizing because they know their old system is coming down
[00:24:55.060 --> 00:24:57.740]  now and they can't prop it up anymore.
[00:24:57.740 --> 00:25:02.180]  It was designed to collapse, but now the bubble's gotten so big they can't even keep
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:03.180]  it going.
[00:25:03.180 --> 00:25:05.540]  So that's why they're basically been painted into a corner.
[00:25:05.540 --> 00:25:08.980]  That's why we've got to be politically engaged so that instead of them getting more power
[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:14.300]  out of this tyranny, this can be their political, cultural, Waterloo, and we can foreglow
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.100]  massive violence that they're planning.
[00:25:17.100 --> 00:25:19.600]  Separately, please remember we're listed supported.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:23.700]  This beyond critical information is sponsored by you, the people of America and the world.
[00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:29.500]  We have incredible products at info war store.com and our three flagship products are rarely
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:31.580]  in stock together, but they are.

[00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:09.840]  three products together or 25% off individually.
[00:26:09.840 --> 00:26:15.200]  But in closing in this segment, I want to just talk directly to all of you listening
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:21.200]  out there and ask you a question after everything you've seen these criminals do, do you think
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:25.140]  you're going to be safer and healthier and wealthier and wiser if you roll over and
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:27.180]  go along with them?
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:32.420]  Or are you going to fully educate yourself on this and start educating others because
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.820]  sunlight is the disinfectant.
[00:26:34.820 --> 00:26:41.800]  We've got to spotlight these cockroaches like Ted Nugent says, and we've got to reach
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:49.660]  out to God and pray to God to lead God and direct us because without God, we don't
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:50.660]  have a hope.
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:54.240]  If we have God, no one can stand against this, but this is true evil and we have
[00:26:54.340 --> 00:26:55.340]  to admit true evil exists.
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:58.840]  We have to understand this is not the legitimate government.
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:03.640]  This is the military industrial complex controlled by a small technological corporate
[00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:07.200]  scientific elite that Eisenhower warned us about.
[00:27:07.200 --> 00:27:10.160]  Most people only talk about his military industrial complex comment.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:15.700]  He said controlled by a technological elite and that was in 1961.
[00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:20.360]  He was aware of what was going on and he was warning people about it.
[00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:22.720]  So these people think everybody else are animals.
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:26.520]  They think we're all stupid and that we deserve to die.
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:27.920]  They are eugenics based.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:29.840]  He goes back to Plato.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:34.080]  They're quote aristocrats who are not trying to empower and hold up society and build
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:36.320]  libraries and educate children.
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:41.040]  They're going against all that and trying to dumb us down so that we're more easily
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:43.040]  processed and gotten rid of.
[00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:47.640]  One of the head of the club of Rome famously says two years ago, we played the club last
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:48.640]  week.
[00:27:48.640 --> 00:27:49.640]  In fact, Owen's coming up.
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.640]  We should play it again.
[00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:53.040]  In fact, we'll come out and break and play it.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:59.360]  He said, I hope we can depopulate the planet in a civil way, but he goes, but we're going
[00:27:59.360 --> 00:28:00.920]  to depopulate you.
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:04.720]  And again, the average white liberal goes, yo, there are too many people.
[00:28:04.720 --> 00:28:06.880]  Hey, dumb ass, you're being fed the bugs.
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:08.580]  You're having your energy cut off.
[00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:10.360]  You're being sprayed with this stuff as well.
[00:28:10.360 --> 00:28:15.080]  It's the left that's targeted the most that takes all the shots that buys into it.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:16.720]  So they believe they're promoting a utopia.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.500]  They're promoting a dystopian.
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:21.440]  This is a war against humanity.
[00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:23.080]  This is the end of the world.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:26.300]  As we know it, everything previous to this has been a buildup.
[00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:28.940]  We're going into the permanent emergency.
[00:28:28.940 --> 00:28:32.260]  Someone asked us again to realize the power you've got right now.
[00:28:32.260 --> 00:28:35.460]  Take the live link to the show info awards.com forward slash show.
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:39.140]  Take the links off Bandai video when those reports are archived at Bandai video, share
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.180]  it like your life depends on it because it does take action.
[00:28:42.180 --> 00:28:44.220]  Now don't roll over and die.
[00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:56.500]  We'll be right back.
[00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:00.780]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:01.780]  Thought it was next week.
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:02.780]  I come in this morning.
[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:06.260]  It's back in the warehouse ready to roll.
[00:29:06.260 --> 00:29:10.140]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula and the first thing I did was pop one of these bad
[00:29:10.140 --> 00:29:12.140]  boys.
[00:29:12.140 --> 00:29:14.140]  Overhead shot please.
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:22.400]  Look how full this bottle is.
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:26.460]  Right to the top folks.
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:32.260]  Right to the top with these 95% curcumin oil.
[00:29:32.260 --> 00:29:36.300]  Again most turmeric formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10%.
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:39.060]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:43.140]  This is 95%.
[00:29:43.140 --> 00:29:44.140]  Super constant.
[00:29:44.140 --> 00:29:45.140]  It's like taking one pill.
[00:29:45.140 --> 00:29:47.780]  It's like taking 10 of the average pill.
[00:29:47.780 --> 00:29:48.780]  It's that powerful.
[00:29:48.780 --> 00:29:49.780]  Or more.
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:30:10.780]  We finally have our original best selling colloidal silver back in stock.
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:14.900]  With the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems in the economy we could not get the
[00:30:14.900 --> 00:30:19.980]  highest quality colloidal silver for almost 3 years back in stock.
[00:30:19.980 --> 00:30:21.500]  But now we've got it.
[00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:23.940]  30 parts per million from the top lab.
[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:24.940]  We've got a limited shipment.
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:28.900]  Hopefully we'll have a lot of it in the future but if you want to experience and
[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:34.700]  have in your medicine cabinet, have in your preparedness arsenal high quality colloidal

[00:31:04.100 --> 00:31:08.220]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing high quality
[00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:09.980]  coffee has not been available.
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:13.580]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:14.580]  gone down some.
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:17.860]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us.
[00:31:17.860 --> 00:31:24.540]  But now we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:27.400]  that's veteran owned and veteran operated.
[00:31:27.400 --> 00:31:30.620]  It's powered by the company Minute Man Coffee.
[00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:36.920]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is the best tasting, best smelling, strongest coffee
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:39.120]  that I have ever drank.
[00:31:39.120 --> 00:31:40.960]  It is game changing.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:43.160]  All you got to do is buy a bag of it and try it.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.600]  I know you're going to be hooked, which will then fund operation a 360 win.

[00:32:04.680 --> 00:32:11.840]  Omega three fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be obtained through
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:12.840]  diet.
[00:32:12.840 --> 00:32:17.860]  They can be found in grass fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban
[00:32:17.860 --> 00:32:18.860]  it.
[00:32:18.860 --> 00:32:24.120]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega threes.
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:29.640]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:35.280]  The best option is our ultimate fish oil and ultimate krill oil at info war store

[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:50.880]  They improve mood, mental clarity and immune function.

[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.960]  the new world order.
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:27.840]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:33:27.840 --> 00:33:46.480]  And we are back live on this Monday edition.
[00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:51.480]  Here is Sir Dennis Meadows, one of the top tacticians and brains of the globalists,
[00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:56.440]  one of the founders of the club of Rome, openly saying a few years ago on national
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:34:01.560]  television that he hopes we can be depopulated in a civil way when he's saying it.
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.060]  Don't fight back.
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:04.060]  Don't struggle.
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:06.840]  Just let us slowly poison you and kill you and get rid of you.
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:09.760]  Let us euthanize you and just give us the planet.
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:15.260]  It's not like the Borg showing up in a fictional Star Trek and saying you will be assimilated
[00:34:15.260 --> 00:34:16.260]  resistance is futile.
[00:34:16.260 --> 00:34:17.260]  No, no, no, no.
[00:34:17.260 --> 00:34:18.520]  You won't get assimilated.
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:19.520]  You'll be killed.
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:22.080]  And you just saw local Fox News.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:29.160]  We have national Fox News with the government spraying across the country, masses of people
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:32.200]  with deadly compounds to give them cancer.
[00:34:32.200 --> 00:34:33.960]  And this was in the 50s.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.600]  That was just the test.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:38.960]  We're now living in the full operation.
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:41.200]  And so here he is saying roll over and die.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:44.300]  As for me in info wars, I'm not rolling over and I'm not dying.
[00:34:44.300 --> 00:34:52.260]  Here is the wicked, wicked in your face statement.
[00:34:52.260 --> 00:34:57.480]  So far globally, you are so far above the population and the consumption levels, which
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:01.360]  can be supported by this planet that I know in one way or another, it's going to come
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:02.360]  back down.
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:05.980]  So I don't hope to avoid that.
[00:35:05.980 --> 00:35:21.180]  I hope that it can occur in a civil way, and I mean civil in a special way, peaceful.
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:27.860]  Peace doesn't mean that everybody's happy, but it means that conflict isn't solved
[00:35:27.860 --> 00:35:33.900]  through violence, through force, but rather in other ways.
[00:35:33.900 --> 00:35:45.900]  And so that's what I hope for, that we can, I mean, the planet can support something
[00:35:45.900 --> 00:35:54.420]  like a billion people, maybe 2 billion, depending on how much liberty and how much material
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.260]  consumption you want to have.
[00:35:56.260 --> 00:36:02.580]  If you want more liberty and more consumption, you have to have fewer people.
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:08.700]  And conversely, you can have more people, I mean, we could even have 8 or 9 billion
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:14.820]  probably if we have a very strong dictatorship, which is smart, unfortunately, you never
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:17.420]  have smart dictatorships, they're always stupid.
[00:36:17.420 --> 00:36:22.700]  But if you had a smart dictatorship and a low standard of living, but we want to
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.740]  have freedom and we want to have a high sentence, so we're going to have a billion
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:26.740]  people.
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:29.820]  And we're now at 7, so we have to get back down.
[00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:35.700]  I hope that this can be slow, relatively slow, and that it can be done in a way which
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:42.980]  is relatively equal, you know, so that people share the experience and they don't have
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:47.100]  a few rich, you know, trying to force everybody else to deal with it.
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:48.100]  So those are my hopes.
[00:36:48.100 --> 00:36:57.620]  I mean, these are pretty pessimistic hopes, you know, but that's...
[00:36:57.620 --> 00:37:01.380]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we are now live inside the Infowars world headquarters
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:04.380]  in Austin, Texas.
[00:37:04.380 --> 00:37:10.020]  Now, I've got to respond to that video.
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:15.340]  And I'll try to summarize my response in the five minutes we have remaining in this
[00:37:15.340 --> 00:37:17.860]  segment.
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.100]  There's a lot of breaking news right now.
[00:37:19.100 --> 00:37:25.860]  We are going to be covering the continued resolution vote, government shutdown vote, the infighting
[00:37:25.860 --> 00:37:29.060]  inside the Republican Party for those that want to go along and get along, and then the
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:33.300]  others like Matt Gaetz and Lauren Boebert saying, no, enough is enough.
[00:37:33.300 --> 00:37:35.500]  Let's just stop the government spending.
[00:37:35.500 --> 00:37:40.200]  It's better than continuing it just to play politics.
[00:37:40.200 --> 00:37:43.480]  The panic inside the Democrat Party because Trump is surging.
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:44.480]  We got all that.
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:47.460]  But let's respond to what we just heard on that video.
[00:37:47.460 --> 00:37:58.340]  And to put it simply is to just say that is what intellectualism without God sounds
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:00.700]  like.
[00:38:00.700 --> 00:38:11.260]  That is philosophical intellectualism without the belief in creation sounds like.
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:19.680]  Because if you don't believe or know that we are a divine creation of God and that
[00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:26.960]  this consciousness, this gift of life is something beyond our understanding, perhaps
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:35.620]  even outside of the subtle clues that the creator has given us or the not so subtle
[00:38:35.620 --> 00:38:38.540]  clues that these individuals don't seem to pick up on.
[00:38:38.540 --> 00:38:41.780]  That's what it sounds like.
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:52.420]  It's just like trying to ration out food or water, let's say, if you're stranded
[00:38:52.420 --> 00:38:58.780]  on the ocean in a lifeboat and you've got X amount of people and X amount of supplies.
[00:38:58.780 --> 00:39:05.520]  And now you have to intellectually come to terms and say, this is how we're rationing
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:06.520]  this.
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:08.180]  This is how we're going to survive.
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:11.500]  This is the best path forward.
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:17.300]  And so that's how these globalists look at the world.
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:22.740]  We're essentially on a survival raft floating through deep space.
[00:39:22.740 --> 00:39:26.860]  And so we have to ration what we have left on this planet.
[00:39:26.860 --> 00:39:30.800]  And that's what the manmade climate change hoax is all about.
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:35.940]  That's what the medical tyranny, World Health Organization, COVID, biological weapons,
[00:39:35.940 --> 00:39:36.940]  everything else.
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:37.940]  That's what it's all about.
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:42.080]  All the agenda is really all about exactly what he just said right there.
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:46.620]  And they believe they're intellectually and philosophically superior to you.
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:52.440]  But of course, if you can't see that we are living in a divine creation, then you
[00:39:52.440 --> 00:39:56.100]  really go back down to zero, don't you?
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:40:00.260]  So all that philosophy, all that intellectualism, you think you're smarter than everybody else.
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:03.120]  You figured out we're on a life raft in deep space and so you're going to be the
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:09.200]  stewards of humanity, rationing off goods and services and resources.
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:13.760]  Well, actually, you go back down to zero that you don't realize this is a divine creation.
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:20.880]  And so there's two elements, I would say, that are the most important to getting ahead
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:25.320]  of this in our own understanding.
[00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:30.260]  That is the theory of evolution is a lie.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:32.280]  The theory of evolution is a lie.
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:37.040]  Now, I'm not saying evolution is a lie.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:41.240]  But as it's presented to us, it is a complete fabrication.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:48.200]  And in fact, we do have historical, archaeological and all kinds of data, research and analysis
[00:40:48.200 --> 00:40:54.920]  that proves the theory of evolution is just that a theory and actually now has been
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:55.920]  disproven.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:05.520]  One of the greatest individuals to do the work in disproving this and Graham Hancock didn't
[00:41:05.520 --> 00:41:10.560]  invest all of his time and life to disproving the theory of evolution.
[00:41:10.560 --> 00:41:16.880]  Graham Hancock did all this research in his life just because he genuinely was curious
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:21.620]  about the history of this planet and human life on it.
[00:41:21.620 --> 00:41:25.140]  But in that process, with all the work he's done in his decades of research, he has
[00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:27.900]  completely disproven the theory of evolution.
[00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:36.280]  And in fact, we know that there have been civilizations on this planet that were either
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:43.140]  as advanced technologically as we are now, as advanced in their intellect as we are
[00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:47.180]  now, or even more so.
[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:54.100]  Now, the individuals that believe it's their job to ration resources on this planet and
[00:41:54.100 --> 00:42:00.100]  as he explained in the clip, get humanity down to a survivable population level.
[00:42:00.100 --> 00:42:01.260]  Do they even know about this stuff?
[00:42:01.260 --> 00:42:03.220]  Do they care about this stuff?
[00:42:03.220 --> 00:42:04.220]  Maybe they do.
[00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:05.740]  Maybe they don't.
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:11.380]  But this is why, this is why, and let's bring it home now.
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:19.020]  This is why the Bill of Rights, the US Constitution and the free market republic must stand
[00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:22.340]  because it's the only thing that stands in their way, folks.
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:23.340]  What did he say?
[00:42:23.340 --> 00:42:24.340]  This doesn't always mean happiness.
[00:42:24.340 --> 00:42:30.500]  Well, I don't know if I completely agree with that, but if I have a birth right to
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:35.740]  be free and you have a birth right to be free and we have an entire country of people
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:42.780]  that have a birth right to be free working to form a better republic, a better union,
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:47.140]  well then they can't ration our lives, they can't dictate our future, and they can't
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:52.940]  murder our lineage, which is what they want to do, and that's why they have to destroy
[00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:54.540]  the United States of America.
[00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:56.540]  Did I do it in five minutes?
[00:42:56.540 --> 00:43:00.100]  Not so bad.

[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:06.180]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:50.240]  Maybe that's what's always been driving these factors of human sacrifice and torment and enslavement.
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:49:00.240]  That same cold callous intellectual philosophy that there's limited resources on this planet and they're mine.
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:11.240]  I guess in a way, I guess in a way it's really just raw survivalism.
[00:49:13.240 --> 00:49:18.240]  But again, it's cold and it's out of touch with a deeper meaning.
[00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:29.240]  That I suppose these globalists like Bill Gates, the Club of Rome and so many others, I suppose they've completely lost.
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:33.240]  They've completely lost that divine spirituality.
[00:49:33.240 --> 00:49:41.240]  But I don't want to wax on that for the rest of the show because there is a lot of big breaking news today.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:47.240]  Including an ongoing battle right now in Washington, D.C.
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:56.240]  When it comes to this continued resolution bill, and you have a small handful of Republicans,
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:07.240]  and it's the same Freedom Caucus group with a little bit of a difference than say when they were trying to keep McCarthy out as the speaker.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:09.240]  But essentially it's the same group.
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:17.240]  And they're saying, you know what? We're done with this. It's time to just cut this government funding.
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:24.240]  And if we don't want to engage in serious negotiations, then what are we even doing here?
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:33.240]  If we don't want to use, this is Republicans under the House leadership of Kevin McCarthy, or lack thereof I should say,
[00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:42.240]  the lack of leadership from Kevin McCarthy saying, if we're not going to use the power of the purse, then what are we even doing here?
[00:50:43.240 --> 00:50:51.240]  If we're going to go up there and flap our gums about how corrupt the Biden administration and how out of control the Democrats are with their policies,
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:51:00.240]  the open borders, the showing the children porn and everything else, but we're not going to actually leverage the power we have right now with the control of the House,
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:02.240]  then what are we even doing here?
[00:51:03.240 --> 00:51:11.240]  But see, this is the exposure, this is the answer to that question. What are we actually doing here?
[00:51:11.240 --> 00:51:16.240]  Well, most Republicans aren't really doing a damn thing. They're showing up and that's about it.
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:24.240]  They're going along to get along, but that brand of Republican is dying.
[00:51:25.240 --> 00:51:40.240]  And I think right now you're looking at, I believe if there's going to be any hope inside the Republican party to try to save or conserve what we have here in the United States of America,
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:49.240]  the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, a border, common sense, I don't know if this is going to be the final battle,
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:52:02.240]  but this is certainly a major one happening right now. And Matt Gaetz, what he's doing, what he's saying, and how it resonates and populates the Americans is going to be essential.
[00:52:04.240 --> 00:52:08.240]  House GOP fights to win over members on stopgap to prevent shutdown.
[00:52:09.240 --> 00:52:16.240]  And so they propose these bills and Kevin McCarthy wants to have his cake and eat it too.
[00:52:17.240 --> 00:52:22.240]  He's saying, look, we can get this deal done and we can cut into the government spending.
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:31.240]  Well, if you have cancer and your doctor comes up to you and says, you have terminal cancer, you're going to be dead in two years.
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:35.240]  And you say, well, okay, doc, what are my options?
[00:52:36.240 --> 00:52:44.240]  And he says, well, we can either stop the cancer 100% or here's my proposal. I say we stop 8% of the cancer. How about that?
[00:52:44.240 --> 00:52:51.240]  I think 8% is good, right? We'll just cut 8% of the cancer. You're going to sit there and you're going to say, I need to get a new doctor.
[00:52:52.240 --> 00:52:58.240]  That's essentially Kevin McCarthy today and the majority of the Republicans in the House.
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:05.240]  Now, granted, I believe most of those Republicans, if they had real leadership, they would support whatever the leader was doing.
[00:53:06.240 --> 00:53:08.240]  So they just support McCarthy to go along to get along.
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:15.240]  But Kevin McCarthy knows this country has cancer and Kevin McCarthy's proposal is to cut out 8% of the cancer.
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:23.240]  Again, if your doctor told you you got cancer, but he only wants to get rid of 8% of it, you'd go find a new doctor.
[00:53:24.240 --> 00:53:26.240]  So I think it's time for us to find a new doctor.
[00:53:29.240 --> 00:53:32.240]  We've given Kevin McCarthy far too many chances.
[00:53:32.240 --> 00:53:40.240]  Now, you could argue it's too little too late at this point to do any changes of House leadership, and that's perfectly fine.
[00:53:41.240 --> 00:53:48.240]  But we should take this as a lesson into the next round of Congress, hoping Republicans maintain the House,
[00:53:49.240 --> 00:53:55.240]  and say, no, no more Kevin McCarthy, no more squish Republican House leadership.
[00:53:56.240 --> 00:54:01.240]  We want somebody who's the real deal, and right now it's Matt Gaetz who's leading that charge, who I think is vying for that position.
[00:54:02.240 --> 00:54:03.240]  Of leadership.
[00:54:05.240 --> 00:54:12.240]  Now, here are the 15 names saying no to cutting out 8% of the cancer.
[00:54:13.240 --> 00:54:16.240]  And this is an ongoing development here.
[00:54:17.240 --> 00:54:20.240]  This is a constantly changing and updating development.
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:25.240]  So this is just the latest list that I have from an hour or two ago.
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:27.240]  Things are constantly changing.
[00:54:28.240 --> 00:54:33.240]  Here's the list of no's on only cut out 8% of the cancer.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:38.240]  Andy Biggs, Dan Bishop, Lauren Boebert, oh, there's that name.
[00:54:39.240 --> 00:54:40.240]  We might have to talk about that name.
[00:54:41.240 --> 00:54:45.240]  Lauren Boebert voted for it, but oh, oh, oh, I'm a big conservative.
[00:54:46.240 --> 00:54:49.240]  I need to get Lauren Boebert out because she smoked a vape and she got groped at Beetlejuice.
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:54.240]  I'm so much smarter and intellectual.
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:57.240]  I'm more conservative than you because I'm coming for Lauren Boebert.
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:54:59.240]  Ooh, look at me.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:02.240]  Oh, and there she is voting for us yet again.
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.240]  So let's just get rid of that vote, right?
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:06.240]  So sick of this crap.
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:08.240]  We'll have more on that later.
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:18.240]  Ken Buck, Tim Burchett, Eli Crane, Matt Gaetz, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Corey Mills, Ralph Norman, Andy Ogles, Matt Rosendale, Victoria Spartz, Anna Paulina Luna.
[00:55:18.240 --> 00:55:29.240]  Anna Paulina Luna, who just gave birth, has more fight in her than 90% of Republicans in Congress.
[00:55:30.240 --> 00:55:31.240]  And then Paul Gosar.
[00:55:32.240 --> 00:55:40.240]  I mean, you, let me just tell you, when Anna Paulina gives birth and then, and then is, is fighting for this country right afterwards.
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:47.240]  I mean, tip of the cap, tip of the cap, more fight in her than the average Republican man in Congress.
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:49.240]  And she just had a baby.
[00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:52.240]  It's just crazy.
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:56:05.240]  But that's, I mean, I don't know if that's more a testament to how awesome Anna Paulina Luna is or more of a testament on how pathetic the average Republican representative is.
[00:56:05.240 --> 00:56:13.240]  Now, you didn't hear Byron Donald's name on that list, and he eventually did give in to the House leadership of Kevin McCarthy during the vote and now again today.
[00:56:14.240 --> 00:56:15.240]  And I still like Byron Donald, just to be clear.
[00:56:16.240 --> 00:56:17.240]  I still think he's one of the good ones.
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.240]  But he's for this continued resolution to keep the government spending.
[00:56:21.240 --> 00:56:28.240]  And look, because we're getting a little politically wonky here, and conservatives and Republicans have a major messaging problem.
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:33.240]  And that's part of the problems that we face, is that we do have a messaging problem.
[00:56:33.240 --> 00:56:42.240]  And most common sense conservatives or just common sense Americans, they don't even know what's going on because Republicans don't even know how to message them.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:48.240]  The House of Representatives controls the government purse.
[00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:56.240]  So if the Republican party controls the House of Representatives, they can cut that funding off at any minute.
[00:56:57.240 --> 00:57:01.240]  Now you explain that power to the average American, that's going to resonate.
[00:57:01.240 --> 00:57:07.240]  They're going to say, oh, you mean, like Democrats think it's this thing, oh, shutting down the government is a negative thing.
[00:57:08.240 --> 00:57:09.240]  Shutting down the government, Americans don't like that.
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:11.240]  Yeah, they do.
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:14.240]  You think Americans like government?
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:22.240]  What? It's in our blood to despise government.
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:25.240]  It's in the founding of this country.
[00:57:25.240 --> 00:57:33.240]  It's in our founding documents to have contempt for tyrannical governments.
[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:39.240]  I've gone long, but I'm going to come back and explain what's going on here.
[00:57:40.240 --> 00:57:44.240]  On the other side of this break, it's The Alex Jones Show brought to you by infowarsstore.com.
[00:57:45.240 --> 00:57:46.240]  Owen Schroyer filling in.
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:54.240]  Separately, we got some really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really good news.

[00:58:15.240 --> 00:58:17.240]  God gave it to us and it's the strongest humanoid out there.
[00:58:18.240 --> 00:58:20.240]  Other leading brands are like 70% humanoid.
[00:58:20.240 --> 00:58:25.240]  Most brands are 5% humanoid and that still does a great thing for you.
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:27.240]  This is the strongest anybody makes.
[00:58:28.240 --> 00:58:30.240]  95% for humanoid.
[00:58:31.240 --> 00:58:32.240]  I am so glad this is back.
[00:58:33.240 --> 00:58:34.240]  I have been out of this myself for months.
[00:58:35.240 --> 00:58:37.240]  We've been sold out of this for almost seven months.
[00:58:38.240 --> 00:58:39.240]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.

[00:59:47.490 --> 00:59:56.410]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:59:58.580 --> 01:00:24.580]  You know, I wonder, do you just ask the average American, hey, do you think we should shut
[01:00:24.580 --> 01:00:25.580]  down the U.S. government?
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:29.580]  Do you think the U.S. government is out of control and their spending is out of control?
[01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:33.580]  I wonder what the average American would say.
[01:00:33.580 --> 01:00:39.580]  I think that they would probably, maybe by a small margin, but I think most would support
[01:00:39.580 --> 01:00:41.580]  that, as long as the messaging was correct.
[01:00:41.580 --> 01:00:43.580]  But see, the Republicans have horrible messaging.
[01:00:43.580 --> 01:00:47.580]  By the way, where is Ronna Romney McDaniel during any of this?
[01:00:47.580 --> 01:00:48.580]  Nowhere to be found.
[01:00:48.580 --> 01:00:49.580]  What's new?
[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:50.580]  She's great at that.
[01:00:50.580 --> 01:00:53.580]  I got to tell you, she is great at disappearing.
[01:00:53.580 --> 01:00:55.580]  Man, isn't that amazing?
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:00:57.580]  Don't you love that out of a leader, too?
[01:00:57.580 --> 01:01:01.580]  You're always thinking, man, I just wish I had a leader that knew how to disappear.
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:06.580]  I just wish I had a leader that knew how to completely disappear when we needed that
[01:01:06.580 --> 01:01:09.580]  leader the most, when the most important times were ahead of us.
[01:01:09.580 --> 01:01:13.580]  I just wish we had somebody that could just vanish and be nowhere to be found.
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:19.580]  That's Ronna Romney McDaniel for you.
[01:01:20.580 --> 01:01:24.580]  So here's the continued resolution proposed by the Republicans.
[01:01:24.580 --> 01:01:26.580]  And they think this is some kind of a victory.
[01:01:26.580 --> 01:01:32.580]  I mean, yeah, I mean, I guess it's a victory if you just want to slow your death.
[01:01:32.580 --> 01:01:34.580]  The 30-day continued resolution.
[01:01:34.580 --> 01:01:36.580]  And see, here's another problem.
[01:01:36.580 --> 01:01:40.580]  Again, I just don't, there's no leadership here.
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:43.580]  The Republicans have a messaging problem.
[01:01:43.580 --> 01:01:48.580]  They don't even know how to communicate in basic communication skills.
[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:53.580]  I mean, folks, this is Communication 101.
[01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:58.580]  This is Communication 101.
[01:01:58.580 --> 01:02:05.580]  When they say the 30-day CR does two things, how many people in this audience know what CR means?
[01:02:05.580 --> 01:02:07.580]  I'm not trying to be rude.
[01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:10.580]  This is political wonk.
[01:02:10.580 --> 01:02:14.580]  How many people know what CR means?
[01:02:14.580 --> 01:02:16.580]  Less than half.
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:19.580]  Even 10%.
[01:02:19.580 --> 01:02:22.580]  Why are you tweeting out the 30-day CR does two things.
[01:02:22.580 --> 01:02:24.580]  Nobody knows what you're talking about.
[01:02:24.580 --> 01:02:28.580]  Why don't we have clear, basic communication skills?
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:31.580]  This goes beyond just Republicans in Congress.
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:33.580]  I mean, it's basically our language is being destroyed.
[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:37.580]  We don't even know how to properly communicate anymore.
[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:41.580]  The 30-day continued resolution.
[01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:44.580]  Continued resolution.
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:49.580]  Meaning, we're not going to shut down the government, and this is the bill that's going to do it.
[01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:52.580]  This is the continued resolution.
[01:02:52.580 --> 01:02:56.580]  And then here are the agreements.
[01:02:56.580 --> 01:03:00.580]  We ought to learn how to communicate better.
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:02.580]  Secure the southern border.
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:05.580]  You really believe that?
[01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:12.580]  Who here really believes that this continued resolution is going to secure the southern border?
[01:03:12.580 --> 01:03:16.580]  Yeah, right. Sure it will.
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:22.580]  The Biden administration is making it illegal to have border walls.
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:26.580]  They're making it illegal to have a barrier whatsoever.
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:28.580]  So, Arizona tried to get creative.
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:34.580]  They said, well, let's just use these old shipping crates, and we'll just turn that into a makeshift wall,
[01:03:34.580 --> 01:03:37.580]  and then, you know, technically it's not a wall, it's just trash at the border.
[01:03:37.580 --> 01:03:40.580]  The Biden administration doesn't clean up any of the other trash at the border,
[01:03:40.580 --> 01:03:44.580]  so let's just go put these crates down there as a makeshift wall, and it'll just be like trash.
[01:03:44.580 --> 01:03:48.580]  And the Biden administration banned it.
[01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:51.580]  Okay, so then Texas said, well, we'll get a little creative.
[01:03:51.580 --> 01:03:53.580]  We'll do something here at a state level.
[01:03:53.580 --> 01:03:59.580]  We'll put floating barriers out in the water, and maybe that can deter some of the illegal immigration.
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:03.580]  And the Biden administration banned it, and now they're fighting in court.
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:06.580]  They tried to put up barbed wire at the border, just a basic barrier.
[01:04:06.580 --> 01:04:09.580]  Biden administration banned it, sent border patrol down there to clean it up.
[01:04:09.580 --> 01:04:11.580]  So they don't clean up any of the trash.
[01:04:11.580 --> 01:04:12.580]  I mean, I've been down there, there's trash everywhere.
[01:04:12.580 --> 01:04:13.580]  They don't clean that up.
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:17.580]  They clean up the barriers and say, we need to clean up this trash.
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:28.580]  And I'm going to sit here like a fool and believe that this continued resolution is going to stop the invasion at the southern border.
[01:04:28.580 --> 01:04:30.580]  How dumb do you think I am?
[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:38.580]  And then it says it's going to cut government spending by 8%, and there's going to be no Ukraine money.
[01:04:38.580 --> 01:04:42.580]  This is a losing bill up one side and down the other.
[01:04:42.580 --> 01:04:48.580]  And the fact that Republicans in Congress are trying to convince you otherwise is pathetic.
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:50.580]  And I like Byron Donalds.
[01:04:50.580 --> 01:04:54.580]  I think he's a great representative, but Byron, you're not fooling me.
[01:04:54.580 --> 01:04:56.580]  You're not fooling anybody.
[01:05:08.580 --> 01:05:13.580]  Utilized for thousands of years, turmeric is one of the most studied medicinal herbs today.
[01:05:13.580 --> 01:05:21.580]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles are published every year on the chemistry and therapeutic potential of turmeric and its active components.
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:32.580]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body, help boost and support flexibility, increase mobility, assist in joint function, bolster your immune system, and so much more.
[01:05:32.580 --> 01:05:44.580]  Regular turmeric from the store contains about 1-5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids, but our super powerful extract used in bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients in turmeric.
[01:05:44.580 --> 01:05:51.580]  No other product can compare with this curcuminoid delivery system, so if you want to put the true power of turmeric to the test, then look no further.
[01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:58.580]  Grab yourself a bottle today for 25% off at m4store.com and put your body at ease.
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:10.580]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance. And now, your host, Owen Troyer.
[01:06:10.580 --> 01:06:24.580]  Alright, we're into hour number 2 here of the Alex Jones show. Owen Troyer filling in. I'm getting a little politically wonky today.
[01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:32.580]  Only because I'm not going to be sitting here. I'm not going to sit here and be made a fool of. I'm not going to sit here.
[01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:46.580]  Because here's the thing. We have made end roads. We have a beachhead in the Republican party where we can actually peacefully, politically, legally, lawfully try to save our country.
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:07:08.580]  Which is the goal. So yeah, if we can take control of the Republican party with people that actually have common sense and have basic conservative political values, then yeah, absolutely, we should support that movement.
[01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:18.580]  And what's going on today with this continued resolution and the threat of a government shutdown is the perfect example of when it's time to get politically involved.
[01:07:18.580 --> 01:07:39.580]  Now, I understand there are things called Pyrrhic victories or sometimes you have to take the loss to get the greater win. All kinds of examples of this throughout human history.
[01:07:39.580 --> 01:07:55.580]  It's kind of like, you know, it's one of my favorite movies. Have you ever seen the movie 300 where King Leonidas takes his 300 men and he says, well, if they assassinate the king, then they'll have an entire army to deal with.
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:08:00.580]  So he knew. He knew he was going to go in there and take a loss, but ultimately that was going to be a victory for his people.
[01:08:00.580 --> 01:08:10.580]  So, so I get that and I, but I don't know if this is the time to be doing that right now with the house Republicans.
[01:08:10.580 --> 01:08:16.580]  So if you want to take that strategy, you'd say, okay, fine.
[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:30.580]  Okay, fine. As, as Byron Donalds is selling us this today, that the continued resolution will secure the Southern border, cut government spending by 8% and no money will go to Ukraine.
[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:37.580]  I'd say, okay, fine, fine, Byron, fine. We'll accept your continued resolution.
[01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:44.580]  And I guarantee you, hell, it'll even happen within the 30 days and they claim, well, it's not going to happen within 30 days.
[01:08:44.580 --> 01:09:06.580]  Oh, I will. I guarantee you, I guarantee you if, if you take, if the Republicans in the house take the continued resolution, there will still be hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants pouring over the Southern border and the Biden administration will find a way to send more money to Ukraine.
[01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:17.580]  Okay. A hundred percent guarantee. I will 100% guarantee that for you right here today.
[01:09:17.580 --> 01:09:23.580]  And Byron Donalds has to know that. He has to know that that's the truth.
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:32.580]  So why he's playing politics with this, I don't know, but come on, Byron, everybody knows that.
[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:41.580]  Everybody knows that there is nothing you can do to stop the Southern border invasion right now.
[01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:46.580]  And there's nothing you can do to stop the Biden administration from sending more money to Ukraine.
[01:09:46.580 --> 01:09:59.580]  And so the only strategy you have to take is win at all costs strategy.
[01:09:59.580 --> 01:10:04.580]  Now, this is an ongoing situation. Matt Gaetz is taking the leadership role that we need.
[01:10:04.580 --> 01:10:13.580]  Matt Gaetz is taking the leadership role that Kevin McCarthy claimed he wanted to take, but then just became a swamp creature.
[01:10:13.580 --> 01:10:18.580]  Gaetz tweeting out, Kevin McCarthy opposition is growing.
[01:10:18.580 --> 01:10:25.580]  Victoria Spartz issues a statement opposing lack of leadership by Kevin McCarthy.
[01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:31.580]  Victoria Spartz issued the following statement on her opposition to the proposed continued resolution deal.
[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:39.580]  Unfortunately, real leadership takes courage and willingness to fight for the country, not for power and a picture on a wall.
[01:10:39.580 --> 01:10:46.580]  The Republican House is failing the American people again and pursuing a path of gamesmanship and circus.
[01:10:46.580 --> 01:10:48.580]  Oh, she's nailing it.
[01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:54.580]  Neither Republicans nor Democrats have the backbone to challenge the corrupt swamp that is bankrupting our children and grandchildren.
[01:10:54.580 --> 01:11:02.580]  It is a shame that our weak speaker cannot even commit to having a commission to discuss our looming fiscal catastrophe.
[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:09.580]  Our founding fathers will be rolling over in their graves to see how this institution is betraying our republic.
[01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:16.580]  Her personal political ambitions and our children will be ashamed of another worthless Congress.
[01:11:17.580 --> 01:11:21.580]  Representative Victoria Spartz, Indiana District five.
[01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:26.580]  Well, that sums it up pretty well, doesn't it?
[01:11:26.580 --> 01:11:31.580]  And she was one of the 15 no votes on this continued resolution, and that is a small margin in the House.
[01:11:31.580 --> 01:11:36.580]  I think it's like 11 or 12 that as long as they stay in opposition, they can't get anything through.
[01:11:36.580 --> 01:11:43.580]  It's just like the Freedom Caucus during McCarthy's battle and vote to become the speaker.
[01:11:43.580 --> 01:11:51.580]  And what a phony what a phony bag of fluff, empty suit Kevin McCarthy ends up being.
[01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:55.580]  He fought tooth and nail. He scratched and clawed to be the speaker of the House.
[01:11:55.580 --> 01:12:02.580]  And now he is. And he's doing what? Nothing. Nothing.
[01:12:02.580 --> 01:12:06.580]  So. To me, there's two theories of thought here.
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:14.580]  One, you say, OK, and maybe this is how Matt Gates could play it if he feels he's going to lose these votes.
[01:12:14.580 --> 01:12:18.580]  You say, OK, fine, fine, McCarthy.
[01:12:18.580 --> 01:12:21.580]  We'll give you your continued resolution.
[01:12:21.580 --> 01:12:25.580]  But I'm going to come out and I'm going to make a guaranteed right now.
[01:12:25.580 --> 01:12:28.580]  And you could even I mean.
[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:33.580]  You could really throw some weight around and say, hey, Kevin.
[01:12:33.580 --> 01:12:39.580]  You can have my vote and I'll convince all the other Republicans in the House to vote for your continued resolution bill.
[01:12:39.580 --> 01:12:44.580]  But but if in the next 30 days,
[01:12:44.580 --> 01:12:52.580]  the Biden administration sends more money to Ukraine and another illegal immigrant crosses the southern border, you have to step down as speaker.
[01:12:52.580 --> 01:12:57.580]  Well, that's one way to get rid of Kevin McCarthy, because, you know, and I know,
[01:12:57.580 --> 01:13:06.580]  and Kevin McCarthy knows and everybody inside the Republican House knows that this continued resolution will not stop a single illegal immigrant.
[01:13:06.580 --> 01:13:11.580]  And it will not stop a single dime from being sent to Ukraine by the Biden administration.
[01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:15.580]  Who do you think you're kidding?
[01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:21.580]  Who do you think you're kidding?
[01:13:22.580 --> 01:13:29.580]  You know, maybe I should use this opportunity to address this Lauren Bobert situation here.
[01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:33.580]  Because you notice how she's always voting the right way.
[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:36.580]  She's got a really good voting record, actually.
[01:13:36.580 --> 01:13:41.580]  She's probably top she's top 10 percent of Republicans in Congress as far as her voting record is concerned.
[01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:48.580]  And now I have to sit here and I have to watch 20 nothing year old conservative influencers dump on her.
[01:13:48.580 --> 01:14:01.580]  And then I have to watch the same conservatives that have been in the media for decades and watched conservative values in politics and in culture go down the drain year after year after year.
[01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:04.580]  And now those people are going to come after Lauren Bobert.
[01:14:04.580 --> 01:14:11.580]  The same people that have been in conservative politics for decades are now dumping on Bobert saying she's the problem.
[01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:13.580]  You're the problem.
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:19.580]  20 nothing year olds with barely any life experience dumping on Lauren Bobert saying she's the problem.
[01:14:19.580 --> 01:14:22.580]  You're the problem.
[01:14:22.580 --> 01:14:28.580]  Don't forget what the Democrats tried to do just to get Lauren Bobert out of office.
[01:14:28.580 --> 01:14:33.580]  They fought for months after the election was over to remove her.
[01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:40.580]  Then it turns out that this guy she's on a date with is a he owns a gay bar and it's a big Democrat.
[01:14:40.580 --> 01:14:43.580]  What if the whole thing was a setup?
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:47.580]  Now you're doing the Democrats work for them?
[01:14:47.580 --> 01:14:51.580]  Now you have been tricked and duped by liberals.
[01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:54.580]  Conservatives getting tricked and duped by liberals.
[01:14:54.580 --> 01:14:55.580]  Wow.
[01:14:55.580 --> 01:14:57.580]  You must not be very bright.
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:01.580]  What if the whole thing was a setup to take Lauren Bobert out from the very beginning?
[01:15:02.580 --> 01:15:09.580]  Look, Lauren Bobert's private life, quite frankly, is none of my business to this extent.
[01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:11.580]  With her divorce and her kids and everything.
[01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:16.580]  But maybe she's vulnerable or maybe she's behaving like other divorced single mothers.
[01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:19.580]  Very common.
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:25.580]  And so maybe she did get set up and now you're going to do the Democrats dirty work for them?
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:28.580]  By trying to get her out and have her primaried?
[01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:35.580]  And probably cost Republicans another seat and one of our best, strongest, most consistent votes?
[01:15:35.580 --> 01:15:38.580]  And not bad for the culture either?
[01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:42.580]  Oh my gosh, she was vaping, she got groped.
[01:15:42.580 --> 01:15:45.580]  You know what, maybe she made a mistake and maybe she can do better.
[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:48.580]  But really, this is the hill to die on?
[01:15:48.580 --> 01:15:54.580]  And she's up there still voting for us the right way again today when most of the other Republicans will not?
[01:15:54.580 --> 01:15:57.580]  And it's the same people saying, this is what's wrong with Republicans.
[01:15:58.580 --> 01:15:59.580]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:00.580]  I thought it was next week.
[01:16:00.580 --> 01:16:01.580]  I come in this morning.
[01:16:01.580 --> 01:16:04.580]  It's back in the warehouse ready to roll.
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:06.580]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[01:16:06.580 --> 01:16:10.580]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys.
[01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:12.580]  Overhead shot, please.
[01:16:12.580 --> 01:16:16.580]  Look how full this bottle is.
[01:16:16.580 --> 01:16:19.580]  Right to the top, folks.
[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:25.580]  Right to the top with these 95% cuminoid.
[01:16:25.580 --> 01:16:28.580]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%.
[01:16:28.580 --> 01:16:30.580]  Some are maybe 10.
[01:16:30.580 --> 01:16:32.580]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[01:16:32.580 --> 01:16:36.580]  This is 95%.
[01:16:36.580 --> 01:16:37.580]  Super constant.
[01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:41.580]  So like taking one pill is like taking 10 of the average pill.
[01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:42.580]  It's that powerful.
[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:44.580]  Or more.
[01:16:44.580 --> 01:16:47.580]  So they're available at Infowarsstore.com.
[01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:50.580]  Body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[01:16:50.580 --> 01:16:58.580]  Pulled out for almost eight months, back in stock at Infowarsstore.com or 888-253-3139.

[01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:19.580]  And it's different for everybody, but it's always positive.
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:22.580]  Essentially, it just helps in a variety of different ways.
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:24.580]  And whatever way that your body needs, it'll help in that way.
[01:17:24.580 --> 01:17:31.580]  DNA Force Plus is the perfect formula to help you support optimal energy levels while adapting your body to handle the daily bombardment of toxins.

[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:13.580]  With the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems of the economy, we could not get the highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.

[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:20.580]  It's about to sell out. We haven't had it in stock for years.

[01:19:57.670 --> 01:20:07.030]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:08.470 --> 01:20:26.070]  All right, I'm going to move on and cover some other news, including why the Democrats
[01:20:26.070 --> 01:20:30.110]  are in absolute panic right now, and all their behavior shows that.
[01:20:30.110 --> 01:20:35.470]  But first, this special message from Alex Jones.
[01:20:35.470 --> 01:20:37.310]  The trifecta pact is back.
[01:20:37.310 --> 01:20:42.950]  It's been years since we offered this, 40% off on three of our best selling products
[01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:50.530]  that synergistically work together like nothing you've ever seen.
[01:20:50.530 --> 01:20:53.230]  I've got a very exciting announcement to make.
[01:20:53.230 --> 01:20:59.030]  It's been a long time since we offered 40% off on our flagship products.
[01:20:59.030 --> 01:21:01.310]  And normally when we do, it's just one product.
[01:21:01.310 --> 01:21:05.590]  Well, the trifecta sale we haven't done over four years is back.
[01:21:05.590 --> 01:21:11.710]  DNA Force Plus, with all the incredible ingredients, the PQQ, the CoQ10, it cleans out your cells
[01:21:11.710 --> 01:21:13.770]  and makes your telomeres last longer.
[01:21:13.770 --> 01:21:15.190]  It's amazing.
[01:21:15.190 --> 01:21:16.710]  It's back in stock.
[01:21:16.710 --> 01:21:21.670]  We also have Body's Ultimate Turmeric Formula, the strongest 95% curcuminoid turmeric in
[01:21:21.670 --> 01:21:22.670]  it.
[01:21:22.670 --> 01:21:25.070]  Incredible anti-inflammation.
[01:21:25.070 --> 01:21:26.070]  Just so good.
[01:21:26.070 --> 01:21:29.830]  Look on the health benefits of turmeric and then realize this is the strongest turmeric
[01:21:29.830 --> 01:21:31.470]  on the market, 95% curcuminoid.
[01:21:31.470 --> 01:21:34.710]  It's got a bunch of other great ingredients as well that supercharge it.
[01:21:34.710 --> 01:21:37.630]  Go check it out at Infowarsstore.com and do your own research.
[01:21:37.630 --> 01:21:43.070]  And then finally, sold out for a long time, the Real Red Pill Plus is back in stock at
[01:21:43.070 --> 01:21:45.070]  Infowarsstore.com.
[01:21:45.070 --> 01:21:47.550]  You've got to go read about what it's got in it.
[01:21:47.550 --> 01:21:50.950]  Special amino acids that supercharge the folic acid.
[01:21:50.950 --> 01:21:53.630]  That's key in energy production in your cells.
[01:21:53.630 --> 01:21:55.550]  That's the root level of energy.
[01:21:55.550 --> 01:21:56.670]  That's beyond coffee and things.
[01:21:56.670 --> 01:21:58.110]  It actually doesn't just stimulate the nerves.
[01:21:58.110 --> 01:22:01.550]  It stimulates the cells to be cleaned out and operate better and have higher energy
[01:22:01.550 --> 01:22:02.550]  output.
[01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:07.030]  It's got a whole bunch of other incredible ingredients that supercharge the folic acid.
[01:22:07.030 --> 01:22:08.830]  On top of that, it's got the bright one on.
[01:22:08.830 --> 01:22:11.830]  It's got the kitchen sink, Real Red Pill Plus back in stock.
[01:22:11.830 --> 01:22:13.190]  But here's the big announcement.
[01:22:13.190 --> 01:22:19.670]  Not only are all three back in stock, 40% off when you get the trifecta all three
[01:22:19.670 --> 01:22:21.450]  together and they go together.
[01:22:21.450 --> 01:22:22.450]  They are amazing.
[01:22:22.450 --> 01:22:27.430]  I just started last week when Real Red Pill Plus came back in, taking all three together
[01:22:27.430 --> 01:22:29.110]  and it's almost too much sometimes.
[01:22:29.110 --> 01:22:34.390]  I've actually stopped drinking coffee some days because I am bouncing off the walls like
[01:22:34.390 --> 01:22:36.470]  I was 30 years old again when I do it.
[01:22:36.470 --> 01:22:40.470]  People have actually noticed on the air how the old Tasmanian devil's been back a little
[01:22:40.470 --> 01:22:45.590]  bit and it's because I'm taking the turmeric and all the other great ingredients bodies
[01:22:45.590 --> 01:22:46.590]  has.
[01:22:46.590 --> 01:22:49.390]  I'm taking Real Red Pill Plus and I'm taking DNA Force Plus and drinking a lot of clean
[01:22:49.390 --> 01:22:51.830]  water and I'm taking my X3.
[01:22:51.830 --> 01:22:54.990]  So they're all available at info.workstore.com.
[01:22:54.990 --> 01:22:59.310]  This is the trifecta sale and it keeps the broadcast on the air.

[01:23:08.310 --> 01:23:10.350]  all three together, they're incredible.

[01:23:34.790 --> 01:23:39.550]  here.
[01:23:39.550 --> 01:23:44.990]  The political persecution is out of control.
[01:23:44.990 --> 01:23:49.870]  The double standard for justice is criminal.
[01:23:49.870 --> 01:23:58.950]  A DC jury just convicted two 70 plus year old pro-life activists and a DC judge immediately
[01:23:58.950 --> 01:24:06.150]  ordered them into custody.
[01:24:06.150 --> 01:24:12.070]  Announced by DC US Attorney Matthew Graves, whose wife is a radical pro-abortion activist.
[01:24:12.070 --> 01:24:18.590]  Julie Kelly has the story here.
[01:24:18.590 --> 01:24:23.030]  Three defendants convicted of federal civil rights conspiracy and freedom of access to
[01:24:23.030 --> 01:24:24.750]  clinic entrances.
[01:24:24.750 --> 01:24:30.150]  Oh, the justice department is now concerned about civil rights and making sure you get
[01:24:30.150 --> 01:24:35.590]  access unless of course you're a Trump supporter, then you know, then your civil
[01:24:35.590 --> 01:24:41.410]  rights are criminal for obstructing access to a reproductive health services facility
[01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:43.450]  because they're outside protesting.
[01:24:43.450 --> 01:24:46.030]  So let's take a look at these violent criminals.
[01:24:46.030 --> 01:24:47.030]  Look at that.
[01:24:47.030 --> 01:24:51.910]  I'm so glad these violent raging criminals are off the streets.
[01:24:51.910 --> 01:24:55.710]  Are they like the Democrat attorneys that firebombed a police car?
[01:24:55.710 --> 01:24:59.990]  Are they like the Democrat George Floyd, Black Lives Matter, Antifa riders that burnt
[01:24:59.990 --> 01:25:05.390]  entire cities to the ground, billions in property damage, hundreds of hospitalizations,
[01:25:05.390 --> 01:25:06.950]  dozens of deaths?
[01:25:06.950 --> 01:25:12.410]  No, no, they're much worse.
[01:25:12.410 --> 01:25:21.330]  So they'll be taken into custody immediately to, I mean, these could be great grandmothers.
[01:25:21.330 --> 01:25:28.490]  If you're an audio audience member today on the screen, we have the 73 and 74 year
[01:25:28.490 --> 01:25:32.490]  old ladies.
[01:25:32.490 --> 01:25:39.410]  I mean, I just, this country is out of control and I got to tell you, cause I am
[01:25:39.410 --> 01:25:44.130]  a firm believer that America is worth fighting for, freedom is worth fighting for.
[01:25:44.130 --> 01:25:50.090]  And that, I mean, I don't know where else you go, really mean even, even if there
[01:25:50.090 --> 01:25:53.410]  are some countries that come up and might want to preserve freedom and independence
[01:25:53.410 --> 01:25:59.370]  for their people like El Salvador, we'll see what happens with the most right wing
[01:25:59.370 --> 01:26:04.050]  candidate internationally right now in Argentina.
[01:26:04.050 --> 01:26:08.990]  But it's just like at this point, if somebody, when people tell me, Oh, and I got to get
[01:26:08.990 --> 01:26:11.230]  out of this country, this is an authoritarian state.
[01:26:11.230 --> 01:26:14.350]  We have a, we have an out of control road government that's weaponized against the
[01:26:14.350 --> 01:26:15.350]  people.
[01:26:15.350 --> 01:26:16.350]  Yeah.
[01:26:16.350 --> 01:26:20.750]  When they're putting, when they're putting grannies in jail for being pro-life activists,
[01:26:20.750 --> 01:26:24.510]  you know, I, I, I, I get it.
[01:26:24.510 --> 01:26:26.150]  I'd say, I'd say, you know what?
[01:26:26.150 --> 01:26:33.230]  Not my, not my stance.
[01:26:33.230 --> 01:26:36.910]  I believe America is worth fighting for, but you know what?
[01:26:36.910 --> 01:26:37.910]  Yeah.
[01:26:37.910 --> 01:26:41.470]  This government is so criminal and out of control that they'll put grandmothers and they'll goose
[01:26:41.470 --> 01:26:44.190]  step them into the do logs right after their court date.
[01:26:44.190 --> 01:26:45.190]  Yeah.
[01:26:45.190 --> 01:26:46.190]  I get it.
[01:26:46.190 --> 01:26:47.190]  I get it.
[01:26:47.190 --> 01:26:48.550]  This is the most dangerous government on the planet now.
[01:26:48.550 --> 01:26:53.470]  I mean, huh?
[01:26:53.470 --> 01:26:54.750]  What is this Russia?
[01:26:54.750 --> 01:26:56.190]  I thought Russia was the bad guy.
[01:26:56.190 --> 01:27:00.550]  I thought Russia were the authoritarians that arrested grannies for free speech, speaking
[01:27:00.550 --> 01:27:01.550]  out against the government.
[01:27:01.550 --> 01:27:02.550]  I thought that was China.
[01:27:02.550 --> 01:27:03.550]  I thought that was Russia.
[01:27:03.550 --> 01:27:04.550]  I thought that was North Korea.
[01:27:04.550 --> 01:27:09.430]  No, that's the United States of America.
[01:27:09.430 --> 01:27:13.390]  That's the Democrats.
[01:27:13.390 --> 01:27:22.750]  So all the jokes, which weren't really jokes, but all the political references to,
[01:27:22.750 --> 01:27:25.350]  Oh, what is this Russia?
[01:27:25.350 --> 01:27:27.030]  Oh, what is this communist China?
[01:27:27.030 --> 01:27:28.550]  Oh, what is this North Korea?
[01:27:28.550 --> 01:27:30.550]  No, this is America.
[01:27:30.550 --> 01:27:37.750]  Which is Democrat party run America where grandmothers get goose stepped into the gulag
[01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:40.390]  for being pro-life protesters.
[01:27:40.390 --> 01:27:47.270]  Gee, grandma, I guess you made the wrong decision, grandma.
[01:27:47.270 --> 01:27:51.830]  You should have been a liberal pro-choice activist and you should have burned down
[01:27:51.830 --> 01:27:58.510]  a Catholic church or you should have burned down a birthing center or you should have
[01:27:58.510 --> 01:28:00.990]  burned down a pro-life facility.
[01:28:00.990 --> 01:28:03.550]  Then you'd be released on the streets.
[01:28:03.550 --> 01:28:06.670]  Then the Democrats would do a fundraiser for you.
[01:28:06.670 --> 01:28:10.810]  But because these grandmas decided to protest for life and be a pro-life protester, they
[01:28:10.810 --> 01:28:14.830]  get goose stepped into the gulag.
[01:28:14.830 --> 01:28:25.910]  And how sick, how sick do you have to be to be that individual that throws cuffs
[01:28:25.910 --> 01:28:32.270]  on a gray haired granny and marches her into a jail cell.
[01:28:32.270 --> 01:28:34.130]  How sick.
[01:28:34.130 --> 01:28:35.190]  So I get it.
[01:28:35.190 --> 01:28:38.590]  You know, I got to tell you, I get it folks.
[01:28:38.590 --> 01:28:43.270]  I mean, if you haven't thought about your own survival instinct and just having any
[01:28:43.270 --> 01:28:47.430]  semblance of freedom, which would mean for you to leave this country.
[01:28:47.430 --> 01:28:49.050]  I mean, I get it.
[01:28:49.050 --> 01:28:50.050]  I get it.
[01:28:50.050 --> 01:28:53.150]  When you see stories like that, I get it.
[01:28:53.150 --> 01:28:58.630]  Believe me, I get it.
[01:28:58.630 --> 01:28:59.630]  Bodies is back.

[01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:03.140]  answer.

[01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:13.460]  it does for your nerves, your brain, your entire physiological system, for your nervous
[01:31:13.460 --> 01:31:14.820]  system particularly.

[01:31:34.780 --> 01:31:40.260]  Rebel Zen is a private label of one of the top three or four CBD makers in the country

[01:31:58.200 --> 01:31:59.200]  You wanted to plug Rainforce.
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:00.200]  Do you like Rainforce?
[01:32:00.200 --> 01:32:01.200]  Yeah, yeah.
[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:02.940]  So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[01:32:02.940 --> 01:32:05.240]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[01:32:05.240 --> 01:32:09.180]  Four books with Dr. Judy Mikovits, four books with Project Veritas whistleblowers,
[01:32:09.180 --> 01:32:11.560]  and now two books with Alex Jones.
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:14.900]  That's because I use Brainforce every day.
[01:32:14.900 --> 01:32:18.820]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[01:32:18.820 --> 01:32:22.820]  And so I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[01:32:22.820 --> 01:32:28.220]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is Brainforce.
[01:32:28.220 --> 01:32:32.620]  I'll take Brainforce in the morning, right before I go to my computer,
[01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:36.060]  and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[01:32:36.060 --> 01:32:40.980]  So it really is true that Brainforce is something I use every day and it helps me
[01:32:40.980 --> 01:32:41.980]  with my writing.
[01:32:41.980 --> 01:32:42.980]  All right, we love you.
[01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:43.980]  We'll be right back.
[01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:48.460]  Get your Brainforce Plus, Brainforce Ultra, and Turbo Force at infoarestore.com.
[01:32:48.460 --> 01:32:49.660]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[01:32:58.160 --> 01:33:06.920]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:33:08.340 --> 01:33:27.340]  You found it. The tip of the spear. It is the Alex Jones Show with Owen Troyer.
[01:33:27.340 --> 01:33:45.220]  Alright, we got so much going on right now. It's hard to focus on anything. It's like
[01:33:45.220 --> 01:33:54.540]  a merry-go-round except the lever is broken and now it's at max speed. So you can try
[01:33:54.540 --> 01:34:00.760]  to jump off without breaking a leg, but it's hard to get focused on anything. So let's talk
[01:34:00.760 --> 01:34:08.960]  about the panicked Democrats right now and sometimes their media mouthpieces are the
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:14.660]  greatest indicator of what they're feeling on the inside. Now I'll get into the news
[01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:21.360]  stories and the developments that lead us here, but here's Nicole Wallace with MSNBC
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:28.440]  freaking out over the weekend at Trump's rise in popularity and just listen to the panic
[01:34:28.440 --> 01:34:34.960]  in her voice and her presentation here over the weekend, discovering that Trump is popular
[01:34:34.960 --> 01:34:39.920]  and that their propaganda isn't working in Clip 16.
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:43.800]  People say it privately all the time and not on TV all very often. Something really
[01:34:43.800 --> 01:34:49.800]  bad is going to happen, okay? Shit's about to hit the fan in this country. Fox News had
[01:34:49.800 --> 01:34:54.480]  a year away from a lunatic spewing hatred and death threats for Democratic officials
[01:34:54.480 --> 01:35:02.200]  in New York because of the migrant caucus. Everyone is on, I don't even know the word.
[01:35:02.200 --> 01:35:05.880]  Everyone knows that we're walking into something hideous and no one will do anything.
[01:35:05.880 --> 01:35:10.760]  I refuse to believe that nothing can be done. These are people getting their information
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:15.360]  in part because of the vacuum being created by people with, I don't even know if we
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:20.280]  call it a spine anymore. That might be an insult to spines, but there's still people out there
[01:35:20.280 --> 01:35:26.760]  with followings. Here's what I want to ask you. When something happens, what do you
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:30.880]  want to be able to tell your kids and grandkids you did? You're good with nothing?
[01:35:30.880 --> 01:35:33.960]  I didn't do anything because I didn't think anyone would listen to me. Trump tweeted
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:34.960]  something mean about me.
[01:35:34.960 --> 01:35:39.400]  Is that a call for violence? Because you did something. I tried to do something. Where
[01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:44.080]  are all of the recipients who still have little slivers of a following in the cesspool
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:49.000]  that is the MAGA base? Oh, we're the cesspool. Okay. Okay. That's good, guys. That's good.
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:54.440]  We're the cesspool. Not Washington DC. No, the American people are the cesspool.
[01:35:54.440 --> 01:36:03.040]  Not the American media, the American people, not Congress, not politics. It's you, the people.
[01:36:03.040 --> 01:36:11.340]  But let's give an analogy for what Nicole Wallace is so freaked out about. Imagine
[01:36:11.340 --> 01:36:20.620]  you're sitting at home on Friday night with your family. Popcorn's fresh. Sit down. Movie's
[01:36:20.620 --> 01:36:27.500]  about to start. You and your family just trying to enjoy a nice night in and all of
[01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:36.820]  a sudden somebody kicks in your door and wants to rob you and is threatening you. And
[01:36:36.820 --> 01:36:42.460]  then somebody stands up, the man of the house, whatever stands up, grabs their gun and says,
[01:36:42.460 --> 01:36:48.060]  Hey, you better get the hell out of here right now. And then the, and then the thief
[01:36:48.060 --> 01:36:55.460]  and the criminal that broke in your house says, Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa, things are about
[01:36:55.460 --> 01:37:02.660]  to hit the fan here. Yay. Whoa, calm down. We don't want things getting out of hand here.
[01:37:02.950 --> 01:37:11.429]  What is going on? This is madness. This is insanity. You're out of control. What is wrong
[01:37:11.429 --> 01:37:17.470]  with you? Well, of course, that's insane. But that's what this is.
[01:37:17.590 --> 01:37:29.590]  That's exactly what this is. They have opened up our southern border and millions of people have come into this country at your expense.
[01:37:29.590 --> 01:37:39.590]  They have funded a war in Ukraine. The high estimate is hundreds of thousands have died. The low estimate is about 70-80 thousand have died.
[01:37:39.590 --> 01:37:41.590]  And that's on your dime.
[01:37:41.380 --> 01:37:50.380]  Gas prices are up. Inflation is up. Taxes is up. Energy bills is up. Grocery bills is up.
[01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:58.880]  And, and you're supposed to sit there and quietly take it. And, and because you're upset,
[01:37:58.880 --> 01:38:00.920]  Nicole Wallace has the issue with you.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:28.000]  But no, that's exactly what this is. You're sitting at home on a Friday night trying to mind your own business with your family, a criminal breaks into your house and threatens to rob you, and you get up and protect your house and your family with a gun, and the criminal says, hey, whoa, we don't need stuff to get out of hand here, calm down, sit back down, sit down and calm down or things are going to get bad.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  Who's supposed to be in control of that situation?
[01:38:31.260 --> 01:38:43.040]  No, see, the Democrats are panicked because they know their propaganda isn't working.
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:47.860]  They know Americans are realizing what Bidenomics actually is.
[01:38:47.860 --> 01:38:53.220]  Higher gas prices, higher energy prices, higher grocery bills, higher taxes, total illegal
[01:38:53.220 --> 01:38:59.780]  immigration, all the money for Ukraine, no money for Hawaii, no money for East Palestine,
[01:38:59.780 --> 01:39:05.740]  a president that can't even do a press conference, and Biden's poll numbers are tanking, Trump's
[01:39:05.740 --> 01:39:09.700]  poll numbers are up and up and up.
[01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:16.740]  By the way, here's just a quick update from the Biden administration.
[01:39:16.740 --> 01:39:19.460]  Biden took a vacation this weekend.
[01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:22.540]  He went to his beachfront mansion in Delaware.
[01:39:22.540 --> 01:39:27.780]  He has now spent 384 days of his presidency on vacation.
[01:39:27.780 --> 01:39:33.540]  That's 40%, 40% of his presidency on vacation.
[01:39:33.540 --> 01:39:35.240]  Must be nice.
[01:39:35.240 --> 01:39:36.240]  Must be nice.
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:40.100]  And Nicole Wallace says, sit down and shut up.
[01:39:40.100 --> 01:39:42.360]  What in the hell is wrong with you complaining about Joe Biden?
[01:39:42.360 --> 01:39:43.900]  You're the problem.
[01:39:43.900 --> 01:39:50.940]  A panicked, Nicole Wallace says, as her propaganda fails, then he tried to go to dinner with
[01:39:50.940 --> 01:39:51.940]  his family.
[01:39:51.940 --> 01:39:52.940]  He couldn't even walk.
[01:39:52.940 --> 01:39:57.180]  Joe Biden needs help walking upstairs with his daughter, Ashley.
[01:39:57.180 --> 01:40:01.300]  I guess it's probably more appropriate than what we saw or heard about them doing in
[01:40:01.300 --> 01:40:04.180]  the shower.
[01:40:04.180 --> 01:40:07.540]  It's nice for Ashley to forgive Joe for the inappropriate behavior in the shower,
[01:40:07.540 --> 01:40:08.380]  though, you have to say.
[01:40:08.480 --> 01:40:18.879]  And then there's Kamala Harris. Kamala Harris lectures on racist criminal justice system.
[01:40:18.879 --> 01:40:23.740]  Uh huh. What she knows all about. She was part of it because remember, she kept black
[01:40:23.740 --> 01:40:27.679]  men in prison past their release dates so that she could take advantage of the cheap
[01:40:27.679 --> 01:40:33.360]  state labor. So everybody knows Biden's a total fraud. Everybody knows Kamala Harris is a
[01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:39.280]  total fraud. The MSNBC Nicole Wallace propaganda machine is not working. And maybe that's why
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:43.679]  she's so concerned because maybe she's going to lose her cushy job that she doesn't deserve
[01:40:43.679 --> 01:40:48.879]  with that massive paycheck that she never earned because nobody buys her propaganda.
[01:40:52.080 --> 01:40:55.599]  Donald Trump leads Joe Biden nationally in the head to head presidential race.
[01:40:57.200 --> 01:41:02.160]  Almost every poll now is returning with Donald Trump beating Joe Biden head to head,
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:06.400]  just like it was before. And Reuters released a map
[01:41:08.400 --> 01:41:17.360]  of their polls statewide or rather state by state showing what would happen if the election was
[01:41:17.360 --> 01:41:23.440]  held tomorrow. Now here's what's funny about this. This is probably most likely,
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:28.080]  uh oh, I'm about to engage in criminal free speech. Don't tell the feds.
[01:41:28.879 --> 01:41:35.280]  This is most likely more closely a representation of how the 2020 presidential race actually
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:39.280]  finished right there on the screen. So.
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:42:10.160]  What's going to happen when, for the next 420 or 30 odd days, all the national polling indicates that this is our electoral map heading into the 2024 election, and then what's going to happen on election night. Magically, Arizona will be blue. Nevada will be blue. Georgia will be blue. Wisconsin will be blue. Michigan will be blue. Pennsylvania will be blue.
[01:42:10.160 --> 01:42:28.160]  Even though every single poll and every single indicator has Trump winning those states, just like he was 95% of the time during the 2020 election, and then magically at 3.30 in the morning, it flipped blue. Because I'm going to tell you right now, that's what pace we're on.
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:57.160]  From where we stand right now, and keep in mind, there's going to be a lot of changes that happen between now and the election, obviously, but I'm just telling you that the path that we're on right now is that this is going to be how all the polling indicates the 2024 election will go, and it'll go just like it did in 2020, and then those same five states will flip blue at three o'clock in the morning, just like they did in 2020. This is the path we're on, and so I guess we have to relive it, and for the American people to see again.
[01:42:58.160 --> 01:43:21.160]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing high quality coffee has not been available, and that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some. I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us, but now we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran owned and veteran operated.

[01:43:58.160 --> 01:44:11.160]  The globalist aren't just targeting us through the poison shots or the electromagnetic 5g or the GMO crops. They're hitting us with hundreds of chemicals that the EPA has authorized companies and industry to use.
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:24.160]  One of the top pesticides used is atrazine. The allowable level the government admits that they allow to be in your water supply is enough to sterilize you and basically turn your son into a feminized mutant. Look it up.

[01:45:05.160 --> 01:45:17.160]  The wicked draw the sword and bend the bow to bring down the poor and needy to slay those whose ways are upright but their swords will pierce their own hearts and their bows will be broken.
[01:45:17.160 --> 01:45:26.160]  Better the little that have righteousness than the wealth of many wicked for the power of the wicked will be broken but the Lord upholds the righteous.
[01:45:26.160 --> 01:45:47.160]  The blameless spend their days under the Lord's care and their inheritance will endure forever. In times of disaster, they will not wither. In days of famine, they will not plunder. But the wicked will perish. Though the Lord's enemies are like the flowers in the field, they will be consumed and they will develop in smoke.
[01:45:57.160 --> 01:46:14.160]  For everything the globalist hit us with, God through Mother Nature has given us the answer.

[01:47:07.910 --> 01:47:09.910]  Thanks for watching!
[01:47:37.910 --> 01:47:45.970]  This is a train headed north from Mexico to the United States, a train, I mean if
[01:47:45.970 --> 01:47:51.030]  you're just, if you're an audience member today, audio audience member today, folks
[01:47:51.030 --> 01:47:56.630]  we are reaching levels of insanity with this illegal immigration the
[01:47:56.630 --> 01:48:01.349]  likes of which you can't even believe. We're talking about hundreds of train
[01:48:01.349 --> 01:48:06.030]  cars not filled with coal, not filled with anything like that, not filled with
[01:48:06.030 --> 01:48:11.750]  any resources or goods or anything, but illegal immigrants.
[01:48:10.070 --> 01:48:40.070]  So, trainloads, literal trainloads of illegal immigrants coming across the border, and you really believe this continued resolution is going to stop the illegal immigration? Please, Byron Donalds, you're better than that. You're better than that.
[01:48:40.070 --> 01:48:53.070]  We're here to get a couple individuals that are covering the open southern border on the air, and they're so busy documenting the illegal immigration, there's not a moment to rest that we can't even get them on.
[01:48:53.070 --> 01:49:05.070]  They're like, yeah, I'd love to schedule a time to come on, but the illegal immigration issue is so insane, and I've got to be available to document it at all times, so they just can't even commit to coming on the show.
[01:49:05.070 --> 01:49:27.070]  Because it's a 24-7 stream pipeline of illegal immigrants. Now it's by the trainload. You think that this is going to be, oh, you think this is the only trainload? Let me tell you how this goes, because Fox News got this footage, and I know how this goes.
[01:49:27.070 --> 01:49:55.070]  So this means that this was probably the second, third, fourth, maybe fifth trainload, and whoever has access to that security camera at that train stop contacted somebody in the media and said, hey, I've got footage for you that nobody's seen of a literal trainload of illegal immigrants coming into the country.
[01:49:55.070 --> 01:50:10.070]  They say, what, a trainload? They say, yeah, let me send you the footage, we've been watching it for months. It's kind of like, how do you think we got all that footage of the plane loads, the bus loads, the taxi cabs, and everything else that we got?
[01:50:10.070 --> 01:50:21.070]  We get contacted by whistleblowers, they tell us where to go, they tell us where the illegal immigrants are coming across, we go to the spots, we film it.
[01:50:21.070 --> 01:50:35.070]  That's how this works. So that is not the first trainload, and I will bet you right now it won't be the last. Even if they pass this continued resolution, nobody's stopping this illegal immigration.
[01:50:35.070 --> 01:50:45.070]  Footage shows migrants cheering, migrants, illegal immigrants, let's call them what they are. Illegal immigrants. Because we have an immigration process in this country.
[01:50:45.070 --> 01:50:59.070]  So no, you are an illegal immigrant. Hell, I'm not even allowed to speak freely in my own country. I'm not even allowed to be anywhere near the US Capitol in my own country.
[01:50:59.070 --> 01:51:10.070]  But you can hop on a train and come here illegally and get thousands, if not tens of thousands of dollars in value of free handouts from our government.
[01:51:10.070 --> 01:51:28.070]  Insanity. Insanity. So it's not the first trainload, it's not the last.
[01:51:28.070 --> 01:51:53.070]  And you now have judges that are blocking fundraising groups from funding border patrol, remember there was the group that tried to independently fund the wall, they got investigated, they got shut down by the IRS.
[01:51:53.070 --> 01:52:05.070]  And now you've got a judge in Brownsville who is blocking financial donations to law enforcement that are trying to stop the illegal immigrants from coming in.
[01:52:05.070 --> 01:52:16.070]  And so here he is giving a border patrol officer a hard time because he wants to accept these funds to try to do his job and stop the illegal immigrants.
[01:52:16.070 --> 01:52:22.070]  And a liberal judge makes sure that those funds get blocked. And here he is explaining it in clip 12.
[01:52:22.070 --> 01:52:32.070]  This appeared to be a political event. Not that there's anything wrong with that. But I'm very curious why you were the only one selected or given an opportunity to fund it.
[01:52:32.070 --> 01:52:50.070]  So pause it real quick for a little more context here. He says, oh, it's political, it's political to take fundraising efforts from private citizens to support border patrol.
[01:52:50.070 --> 01:53:04.070]  So, okay, if I go down to Brownsville, Texas right now and I go to one of these hot border areas and there's 30 border patrol agents around, and I decide to have a barbecue.
[01:53:04.070 --> 01:53:15.070]  And I say, hey, I want to support border patrol, I'm going to have a barbecue. You guys like brisket? You guys like pulled pork sandwiches? We're going to have a barbecue here.
[01:53:15.070 --> 01:53:29.070]  And then what? A liberal judge is going to say, that's political. Well, what is he really saying? Folks, he's telling you the whole story that only conservatives and Republicans support stopping illegal immigration.
[01:53:29.070 --> 01:53:42.070]  And any action taken or any support to try to stop the illegal immigration is considered a Republican party activity and therefore judges rule that it must be shut down.
[01:53:43.070 --> 01:53:55.070]  So think about that. Wanting to have a border is now considered Republican party politics. So in other words, what's the opposition? Democrat party politics want an open border. Continue.
[01:53:55.070 --> 01:54:06.070]  This appeared to be a political event. Not that there's anything wrong with that, but I'm very curious why you were the only one selected or given an opportunity to fund it or to support it.
[01:54:06.070 --> 01:54:09.070]  And you don't want to share any of the money with any of the other constables.
[01:54:09.070 --> 01:54:20.070]  Because he's a border town. We didn't contact anybody about this. They contacted our department. Who's they? We fund the Blue Foundation. Where are they from? They're from Florida. Florida? Yes, sir.
[01:54:20.070 --> 01:54:30.070]  They contacted, so what they do. Do they support, do they support giving money to democratically elected, to Democrats that are elected law enforcement or just Republicans? The previous two, they did.
[01:54:30.070 --> 01:54:39.070]  Yeah, they were Democrats, sheriffs, which was in Del Rio and El Paso. Sorry, liberal judge wrong. Are they donating money to the sheriff's department here?
[01:54:39.070 --> 01:54:50.070]  I said they did not choose. They chose my department. I got contacted. Because he's in a border town. Help out with this event. But yeah, as far as it being politically directed.
[01:54:50.070 --> 01:54:58.070]  In the flyer, it said that they were going to clean up the mess that the Biden administration had left. That was part of the announcement.
[01:54:58.070 --> 01:55:07.070]  I did not see that on the flyer, sir. You didn't see that? No, sir. I didn't say that on the flyer about the Biden administration. I think this is a political event, constable.
[01:55:07.070 --> 01:55:16.070]  And to put it under the guise of helping out or cleaning up without getting other parties involved, it's very concerning to me.
[01:55:17.070 --> 01:55:27.070]  This is unreal. By the way, nobody's covering this. The only news outlet that's covered this is the Post Millennial. So if you try to find any news on this, you can't.
[01:55:27.070 --> 01:55:37.070]  But guys, see if you can pull it up before the break on the Post Millennial. If you just search, like, Back the Blue or whatever it's called, Fund the Blue. I forget what he said there.
[01:55:37.070 --> 01:55:49.070]  Post Millennial is the only place covering it. So the liberal judge thinks he catches the sheriff's department by saying, well, this group only funds Republicans.
[01:55:49.070 --> 01:55:58.070]  And he says, nope, they funded the last two sheriffs. They were both Democrats. Oops. Oops. There it is. Good job, guys.
[01:55:58.070 --> 01:56:10.070]  Democrat judge blocks $15,000 donation to Texas border town law enforcement as Biden border crisis rages on. He says, well, why do they only give the money to you? Because it's a border town.
[01:56:10.070 --> 01:56:20.070]  It's for border security. So if I had a border security fund, am I going to give that to Iowa?
[01:56:20.070 --> 01:56:32.070]  They're so disingenuous. They're such liars. Why didn't you share that border patrol fund with Iowa?
[01:56:32.070 --> 01:56:43.070]  Now, I'm reaching because this is obviously Texas, but that'd be like, okay, why didn't you share that border patrol fund with Dallas? Because Dallas isn't a border area.
[01:56:44.070 --> 01:56:56.070]  Why didn't you give that money to Travis County? Because Travis County isn't at the border. So we fund the blue $15,000 folks.
[01:56:56.070 --> 01:57:07.070]  I'm not, I mean, again, like, Hey, that's a great effort. And those groups doing that good for them, but $15,000 is barely anything.
[01:57:07.070 --> 01:57:17.070]  And by the way, I know some of the groups there that help fund that. Water filter groups, gun rights groups. $15,000 is kind of just like a pat on the back.
[01:57:17.070 --> 01:57:29.070]  Again, that's great. Democrat judges won't even allow you to walk up to a border patrol agent and just give them a little pat on the back.
[01:57:29.070 --> 01:57:34.070]  Again, if I go down and I say, Hey, I'm going to have a barbecue for border patrol agents, are they going to shut that down too?
[01:57:34.070 --> 01:57:39.070]  So you need to do that for Texas. You need to do that for Dallas and Austin and everywhere else too.
[01:57:39.070 --> 01:57:46.070]  Well, it's a border fund. I don't care. I mean, Democrats at every level are doing everything they can to destroy this country.
[01:57:48.070 --> 01:57:53.070]  I didn't realize this was back this week. I thought it was next week. I come in this morning, it's back in the warehouse ready to roll.

[01:58:48.070 --> 01:58:53.070]  A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that our amazing high quality coffee has not been available.
[01:58:53.070 --> 01:58:58.070]  And that's because the prices went up too high for the raw beans and the quality had gone down some.
[01:58:58.070 --> 01:59:11.070]  I turned down so many companies that wanted to work with us. But now, we have brought back the coffee and it's even better from a national supplier that's veteran owned and veteran operated.

[01:59:47.790 --> 01:59:54.790]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:00:17.790 --> 02:00:24.390]  In case you haven't noticed, the Democrats are completely emboldened because Republicans
[02:00:24.390 --> 02:00:29.870]  have no spine, no backbone, no courage, no tenacity.
[02:00:29.870 --> 02:00:33.390]  So Democrat judges will now block funding.
[02:00:33.390 --> 02:00:43.130]  They will block funding, private funding to border patrol groups.
[02:00:43.130 --> 02:00:49.990]  And they sit up there and they just say, well, you can't do this because they only give it
[02:00:49.990 --> 02:00:51.670]  to Republicans.
[02:00:51.670 --> 02:00:59.170]  And the sheriff's department representative says, no, actually the last two sheriffs were
[02:00:59.170 --> 02:01:00.170]  Democrats.
[02:01:00.170 --> 02:01:06.210]  And then he says, well, y'all got you there liberal.
[02:01:06.210 --> 02:01:08.650]  But they said it was to stop Biden's border disaster.
[02:01:09.450 --> 02:01:12.690]  Well, what do you call six million illegal immigrants since Biden took office?
[02:01:12.690 --> 02:01:17.170]  I mean, Biden is the president.
[02:01:17.170 --> 02:01:23.690]  They did it when Trump was president, too.
[02:01:23.690 --> 02:01:36.570]  I mean, you got, they're throwing grandmothers in jail for being pro-life activists.
[02:01:36.570 --> 02:01:43.330]  They're throwing 73 and 74 year old grandmothers in jail for being a pro-life activist.
[02:01:43.330 --> 02:01:46.930]  I'll go ahead and get ahead of another story right now.
[02:01:46.930 --> 02:02:00.970]  And in fact, let me just preface it by saying this.
[02:02:00.970 --> 02:02:06.210]  The Department of Justice and the federal government is watching me and my lawyer even
[02:02:06.210 --> 02:02:09.650]  more intently now than they ever have before.
[02:02:09.650 --> 02:02:10.650]  OK.
[02:02:10.650 --> 02:02:14.370]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:02:14.370 --> 02:02:17.890]  I'm just going to leave it at that.
[02:02:17.890 --> 02:02:22.730]  Folks, it's worse than just me being sentenced to jail for my free speech.
[02:02:22.730 --> 02:02:35.850]  I'm going to leave it at that for now, but I'll go ahead and get ahead of another story.
[02:02:35.850 --> 02:02:37.570]  There's going to be another case very soon.
[02:02:37.570 --> 02:02:42.730]  It'll it'll the story's going to break in January.
[02:02:42.730 --> 02:02:49.970]  Where individuals who are filming filming on January 6th are now going to start going
[02:02:49.970 --> 02:03:00.650]  to jail.
[02:03:00.650 --> 02:03:04.410]  But.
[02:03:04.410 --> 02:03:09.910]  You're going to you're going to see things in the next year that you can't even believe.
[02:03:09.910 --> 02:03:13.210]  You're going to see levels of corruption from the Democrat Party and the Biden Justice
[02:03:13.210 --> 02:03:18.490]  Department that.
[02:03:18.490 --> 02:03:22.610]  Are even going to make my case look like.
[02:03:22.610 --> 02:03:25.050]  Look like nothing.
[02:03:25.050 --> 02:03:26.810]  My case is the test case.
[02:03:26.810 --> 02:03:37.130]  I'm going to tell you that right now, my taste, my case is the test case.
[02:03:37.130 --> 02:03:40.090]  And the Department of Justice.
[02:03:40.090 --> 02:03:45.930]  If they can arrest Owen Troyer for his speech, then they have thousands of arrests
[02:03:45.930 --> 02:03:46.930]  following.
[02:03:46.930 --> 02:03:51.530]  I was going to tell you.
[02:03:51.530 --> 02:03:54.769]  I don't want to get too out ahead of this.
[02:03:54.769 --> 02:03:56.690]  We've got a legal strategy.
[02:03:56.690 --> 02:03:58.170]  We've said our piece.
[02:03:58.170 --> 02:03:59.490]  The legal fight is ongoing.
[02:03:59.490 --> 02:04:03.010]  I can't thank the audience enough for supporting it at.
[02:04:03.010 --> 02:04:04.010]  Defend Owen dot com.
[02:04:04.010 --> 02:04:08.170]  But I'm just telling you right now.
[02:04:08.170 --> 02:04:10.450]  They were watching me heavily before.
[02:04:10.450 --> 02:04:17.130]  Now it's like 10 times and it's everything my lawyer is doing.
[02:04:17.130 --> 02:04:19.690]  And it's my case that is the test case.
[02:04:19.690 --> 02:04:20.809]  That's the first domino to fall.
[02:04:20.809 --> 02:04:23.750]  I'm gonna tell you right now.
[02:04:23.750 --> 02:04:26.430]  So if Owen Troyer.
[02:04:26.430 --> 02:04:30.390]  If Owen Troyer gets incarcerated and this this unbelievable overreach by the federal
[02:04:30.390 --> 02:04:33.870]  government and Department of Justice for my speech.
[02:04:33.870 --> 02:04:38.510]  If they're successful with that, thousands of other individuals and journalists are going
[02:04:38.510 --> 02:04:42.550]  to be arrested next.
[02:04:42.550 --> 02:04:43.870]  That's what's going on.
[02:04:43.870 --> 02:04:48.550]  I mean, you think it's just one liberal judge trying to block fifteen thousand dollars
[02:04:48.550 --> 02:04:49.990]  from getting to Border Patrol?
[02:04:49.990 --> 02:04:55.710]  Folks, these Democrats on every level of this government are just berserking to try
[02:04:55.710 --> 02:04:58.950]  to destroy our country.
[02:04:58.950 --> 02:05:01.790]  The most powerful in force life formula yet.

[02:06:48.350 --> 02:06:53.350]  Three hundred plus car motorcade spotted on Long Island in New York.
[02:06:53.350 --> 02:06:58.350]  Yeah. Show me a Biden motorcade.
[02:06:58.350 --> 02:07:03.350]  Show me a Biden boat parade. Show me a Biden hat. Show me a Biden rally.
[02:07:03.350 --> 02:07:07.350]  There are none, but he has the most votes of all time.
[02:07:07.350 --> 02:07:11.350]  Duh. Stupid.
[02:07:12.350 --> 02:07:17.350]  That's like.
[02:07:17.350 --> 02:07:20.350]  It's like if.
[02:07:20.350 --> 02:07:26.350]  Let's say Mike Trout, major league baseball player.
[02:07:26.350 --> 02:07:30.350]  Mike Trout has the most home runs in major league history. You say, really?
[02:07:30.350 --> 02:07:33.350]  Well, show me the home runs. Well, he doesn't have the most home runs in major league history.
[02:07:33.350 --> 02:07:40.350]  They just he did. They just said he did. And he just has the numbers on a sheet somehow.
[02:07:40.350 --> 02:07:45.350]  So it's insanity.
[02:07:45.350 --> 02:07:52.350]  Maybe I'll get into this. No, no, no. Let me just get into this now. Let me just get into this now, because.
[02:07:52.350 --> 02:07:57.350]  From all the election coverage that I've done here at Infowars,
[02:07:57.350 --> 02:08:02.350]  the 2016 presidential, the 2018 midterms, the 2020 presidential, the 2022 midterms.
[02:08:02.350 --> 02:08:07.350]  And now we're heading into the 2024 presidential. I've learned a lot.
[02:08:07.350 --> 02:08:13.350]  And I will tell you, research, when it comes to data and analytics and statistics,
[02:08:13.350 --> 02:08:21.350]  has always been a strong field of mine, because when you come up in sports media and as a sports writer,
[02:08:21.350 --> 02:08:26.350]  that's a major thrust of your work. So I've always been good at that.
[02:08:26.350 --> 02:08:30.350]  And that translated well to elections.
[02:08:30.350 --> 02:08:34.350]  And so there was a major trend.
[02:08:34.350 --> 02:08:39.350]  That if you follow my coverage, you knew about this, but you don't even have to follow my coverage.
[02:08:39.350 --> 02:08:43.350]  This is all publicly available data.
[02:08:43.350 --> 02:08:49.350]  When it comes to elections and now others are starting to pick up on it.
[02:08:49.350 --> 02:08:55.350]  What is the analogy that I've always made?
[02:08:55.350 --> 02:08:59.350]  The Biden 2020 election victory is like.
[02:09:00.350 --> 02:09:07.350]  Nobody in Major League Baseball hit 60 home runs for 60 years, and now all of a sudden multiple players are doing it.
[02:09:07.350 --> 02:09:12.350]  Well, something wasn't organic. It was steroids.
[02:09:12.350 --> 02:09:16.350]  So you find out those numbers were inflated by steroids.
[02:09:16.350 --> 02:09:23.350]  But now the same thing happens. With votes.
[02:09:23.350 --> 02:09:29.350]  Carrie Lakes, people are analyzing this and they're using it as part of their appeal in her lawsuit.
[02:09:29.350 --> 02:09:33.350]  Did you know this is Tyler Boyer reporting?
[02:09:33.350 --> 02:09:41.350]  Did you know the Arizona population only increased about 9 percent from 2014 to 2022?
[02:09:41.350 --> 02:09:47.350]  But its voter participation in the same time period increased over 70 percent.
[02:09:47.350 --> 02:09:53.350]  Carrie Lake received more than 50 percent increased votes than Doug Ducey's first election.
[02:09:53.350 --> 02:09:57.350]  Hobbs received twice as many as Duvall.
[02:09:57.350 --> 02:10:01.350]  The left's game. Now, again, folks, this is all publicly available data.
[02:10:01.350 --> 02:10:07.350]  Looks like they're pulling this. This looks like Wikipedia pages here, but Wikipedia does have good election data.
[02:10:07.350 --> 02:10:14.350]  But but this stuff is verifiable everywhere. And it's I mean, ninety nine point eight percent of the time it all lines up.
[02:10:14.350 --> 02:10:19.350]  You might find different numbers depending on what site you go to, but it's overall usually the same picture.
[02:10:19.350 --> 02:10:25.350]  So let me explain this phenomenon. What what happened?
[02:10:25.350 --> 02:10:31.350]  Twenty twenty is the best example of this because it's the most obvious.
[02:10:31.350 --> 02:10:35.350]  Twenty twenty is the 1998 Major League Baseball season.
[02:10:35.350 --> 02:10:44.350]  Where nobody hit 60 home runs for 60 years and now multiple players are hitting 60 plus home runs.
[02:10:44.350 --> 02:10:49.350]  Losers. Typically Republicans.
[02:10:49.350 --> 02:11:00.350]  Losers like Donald Trump in the 2020 election set records for getting the most votes of all time.
[02:11:00.350 --> 02:11:07.350]  Yeah, it wasn't just Donald Trump, it was all across the country.
[02:11:07.350 --> 02:11:23.350]  That the losers in dozens, if not hundreds of major political races, losers were setting records for the most votes of all time.
[02:11:23.350 --> 02:11:34.350]  Now, you tell me how that's possible. You tell me.
[02:11:34.350 --> 02:11:40.350]  But see, it was the same thing with steroids in baseball. Sammy Sosa hit 66 home runs in 1998.
[02:11:40.350 --> 02:11:47.350]  It was more home runs than anybody of all time. But he was still the loser in the home run chase.
[02:11:47.350 --> 02:11:51.350]  But it was the same thing. Everybody knew it wasn't natural.
[02:11:51.350 --> 02:11:57.350]  Everybody knew steroids were in baseball.
[02:11:57.350 --> 02:12:02.350]  But we just ignored it for the time being and then years later made a big fuss of it and called it corruption.
[02:12:02.350 --> 02:12:10.350]  But everybody knew it at the time. It's the same thing happening with our elections.
[02:12:10.350 --> 02:12:15.350]  Any honest evaluator of this data.
[02:12:16.350 --> 02:12:23.350]  Auditor, forensics auditor, data analysis, anybody looking at this would obviously see this and say there is a giant anomaly here.
[02:12:23.350 --> 02:12:28.350]  Something is not natural.
[02:12:28.350 --> 02:12:34.350]  It's not just Carrie Lake losing the governor's race in Arizona with a record number of votes.
[02:12:34.350 --> 02:12:39.350]  It's not just Donald Trump losing the presidency with a record number of votes.
[02:12:39.350 --> 02:12:45.350]  This happened across the entire country.
[02:12:45.350 --> 02:12:51.350]  Now, you tell me how that happens.
[02:12:55.350 --> 02:12:59.350]  Folks, in some of these areas, we're talking about.
[02:12:59.350 --> 02:13:05.350]  Forty, 50 percent increase in voter turnout.
[02:13:05.350 --> 02:13:10.350]  We're talking obscene numbers here.
[02:13:10.350 --> 02:13:13.350]  Impossible even.
[02:13:13.350 --> 02:13:25.350]  But my speech is criminalized by the Justice Department because I doubt that those results are fair.
[02:13:25.350 --> 02:13:31.350]  I doubt that those results represented what actually happened.
[02:13:35.350 --> 02:13:37.350]  Come on.
[02:13:37.350 --> 02:13:40.350]  Come on.
[02:13:40.350 --> 02:13:44.350]  Do we really have to play this game?
[02:13:44.350 --> 02:13:52.350]  Do we really have to pretend like Mark McGuire and Sammy Sosa and Barry Bonds are not using steroids?
[02:13:52.350 --> 02:14:04.350]  Do we really have to pretend that hundreds of races across the country in 2020 and 2022, the losers got record voter turnout?
[02:14:05.350 --> 02:14:13.350]  Are you really going to argue me that Joe Biden got 15 million more votes than Barack Obama?
[02:14:13.350 --> 02:14:15.350]  Really?
[02:14:15.350 --> 02:14:18.350]  You believe that?
[02:14:18.350 --> 02:14:23.350]  And so you see, that's the frustration here.
[02:14:23.350 --> 02:14:33.350]  When I have the Justice Department, which is corrupt, but then the attorneys that get put on these cases that probably are not corrupt people, they're just doing their job.
[02:14:34.350 --> 02:14:36.350]  But they're the ones that are going to criminally charge me.
[02:14:36.350 --> 02:14:41.350]  They're the ones that are going to write sentencing memos, criminalizing my free speech.
[02:14:41.350 --> 02:14:46.350]  And I just sit here and I say, really?
[02:14:46.350 --> 02:14:48.350]  Really?
[02:14:48.350 --> 02:14:51.350]  You believe Joe Biden got 15 million more votes than Barack Obama?
[02:14:51.350 --> 02:14:52.350]  Show me a Biden rally.
[02:14:52.350 --> 02:14:53.350]  Show me a Biden hat.
[02:14:53.350 --> 02:14:55.350]  Show me a Biden boat parade.
[02:14:55.350 --> 02:15:00.350]  Show me a Biden car caravan.
[02:15:00.350 --> 02:15:01.350]  Really?
[02:15:01.350 --> 02:15:04.350]  I'm not allowed to question an election.
[02:15:04.350 --> 02:15:09.350]  I'm not allowed to question whether Mark Maguire, Barry Bonds, and Sammy Sosa use steroids.
[02:15:09.350 --> 02:15:18.350]  I'm not allowed to question Barry Bonds, whose head grew five sizes, looks like a damn bobblehead.
[02:15:18.350 --> 02:15:20.350]  I'm not allowed to question that.
[02:15:20.350 --> 02:15:23.350]  I mean, are you serious?
[02:15:23.350 --> 02:15:27.350]  And so it's beyond just criminalizing my free speech.
[02:15:27.350 --> 02:15:35.350]  It's that you're criminalizing speech about an issue that you clearly have no idea about,
[02:15:35.350 --> 02:15:41.350]  that you clearly have not investigated for yourself, because this is your country, too.
[02:15:41.350 --> 02:15:42.350]  This is your country, too.
[02:15:42.350 --> 02:15:46.350]  This is where your kids are going to have to grow up to.
[02:15:46.350 --> 02:15:51.350]  But I'm not allowed to question how Joe Biden gets 15 million more votes than Barack Obama.
[02:15:51.350 --> 02:15:55.350]  I'm not allowed to question how hundreds of losers have record-setting voter turnout.
[02:15:55.350 --> 02:15:56.350]  I'm not allowed to question that.
[02:16:25.350 --> 02:16:30.350]  Preparedness Arsenal, high-quality colloidal silver from the best manufacturer.
[02:16:30.350 --> 02:16:36.350]  We have it right now, private-labeled, under the name Silver Bullet at Infowarsstore.com.

[02:16:55.350 --> 02:17:01.350]  I talk a lot about the great successes Infowars has had.
[02:17:01.350 --> 02:17:03.350]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[02:17:03.350 --> 02:17:07.350]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[02:17:07.350 --> 02:17:12.350]  When we talk about the crew at Infowars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[02:17:12.350 --> 02:17:16.350]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[02:17:16.350 --> 02:17:21.350]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroyer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[02:17:21.350 --> 02:17:25.350]  five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[02:17:25.350 --> 02:17:29.350]  So for myself and the whole Infowars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[02:17:29.350 --> 02:17:35.350]  I only encourage you now to realize that Infowars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[02:17:35.350 --> 02:17:38.350]  I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it.
[02:17:38.350 --> 02:17:42.350]  But most viewers and listeners never go to Infowarsstore.com,
[02:17:42.350 --> 02:17:45.350]  and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life,
[02:17:45.350 --> 02:17:47.350]  while at the same time keep us on air.
[02:17:47.350 --> 02:17:51.350]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:17:51.350 --> 02:17:55.350]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to Infowarsstore.com,
[02:17:55.350 --> 02:17:58.350]  our funding problems will be over. Please take action now.
[02:17:58.350 --> 02:18:01.350]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands down,
[02:18:01.350 --> 02:18:04.350]  this is the most concentrated, high-quality bone broth there is.
[02:18:04.350 --> 02:18:08.350]  Concentrated chicken broth, patented amazing.
[02:18:08.350 --> 02:18:12.350]  Then a huge dose of chaga mushroom, a massive dose of beet pollen,
[02:18:12.350 --> 02:18:15.350]  a gigantic dose of highest quality turmeric,
[02:18:15.350 --> 02:18:17.350]  and then it just gets crazier from there.
[02:18:17.350 --> 02:18:20.350]  It's about to sell out. We haven't had it in stock for years.
[02:18:20.350 --> 02:18:22.350]  This first new run is about to sell out.

[02:19:17.350 --> 02:19:22.350]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[02:19:22.350 --> 02:19:29.350]  Your best option is our ultimate fish oil and ultimate krill oil at Infowarsstore.com.

[02:19:36.350 --> 02:19:38.350]  our brain and our heart.
[02:19:38.350 --> 02:19:43.350]  They improve mood, mental clarity, and immune function.
[02:19:43.350 --> 02:19:48.350]  Get your essential omega-3 fatty acids from the best sources available.
[02:19:48.350 --> 02:19:51.350]  Ultimate fish oil and ultimate krill oil.

[02:19:56.780 --> 02:20:05.500]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:20:06.920 --> 02:20:31.400]  Barry Bonds never used steroids, his hat didn't grow 10 sizes, and Joe Biden got 15 million
[02:20:31.400 --> 02:20:35.560]  more votes than Barack Obama and Donald Trump, who got a record number of votes, lost the
[02:20:35.560 --> 02:20:36.560]  election to Joe Biden.
[02:20:36.560 --> 02:20:44.760]  It's all very real and Democrats have never stoked or tried to incite violence with their
[02:20:44.760 --> 02:20:46.720]  rhetoric ever.
[02:20:46.720 --> 02:20:51.680]  And so this video here in clip 11 is completely meaningless, doesn't prove any of that and
[02:20:51.680 --> 02:20:56.220]  certainly doesn't show the double standard applied in the justice system here in clip
[02:20:56.220 --> 02:20:57.220]  11.
[02:20:57.220 --> 02:21:02.680]  Just don't even know why there aren't uprisings all over the country, maybe there will be.
[02:21:02.680 --> 02:21:04.660]  People need to start taking to the streets.
[02:21:04.660 --> 02:21:06.420]  This is a dictator.
[02:21:06.420 --> 02:21:09.500]  You know, there needs to be unrest in the streets for as long as there's unrest in our
[02:21:09.500 --> 02:21:10.500]  lives.
[02:21:10.500 --> 02:21:12.360]  Enemies of the state.
[02:21:12.360 --> 02:21:16.580]  Show me where it says that protests are supposed to be polite and peaceful.
[02:21:16.580 --> 02:21:20.420]  Do something about your dad's immigration practices, you feckless f***er.
[02:21:20.420 --> 02:21:21.980]  They go low, he kicked him.
[02:21:21.980 --> 02:21:24.940]  How do you resist the temptation to run up and wring her neck?
[02:21:24.940 --> 02:21:31.500]  Biggest terror threat in this country is white men, most of them radicalized to the
[02:21:31.500 --> 02:21:32.500]  right.
[02:21:32.500 --> 02:21:33.500]  I thought he should have punished him in the face.
[02:21:33.500 --> 02:21:37.180]  Even if you lost, he insulted your wife, he came down the escalator and called Mexicans
[02:21:37.180 --> 02:21:38.180]  rapists and murderers.
[02:21:38.180 --> 02:21:39.180]  He said, well, what do you think I should have done?
[02:21:39.180 --> 02:21:41.020]  I said, I think you should have punched him in the face and then gotten out of the
[02:21:41.020 --> 02:21:42.020]  race.
[02:21:42.020 --> 02:21:43.020]  You would have been a hero.
[02:21:43.020 --> 02:21:44.020]  I'd like to punch him in the face.
[02:21:44.020 --> 02:21:47.140]  I said, if we were in high school, I'd take him behind the gym and beat the hell out
[02:21:47.140 --> 02:21:48.140]  of him.
[02:21:48.140 --> 02:21:50.140]  Punch some people in the face.
[02:21:50.140 --> 02:21:54.100]  When was the last time an actor assassinated a president?
[02:21:54.100 --> 02:22:00.580]  They're still going to have to go out and put a bullet in Donald Trump and that's a fact.
[02:22:00.580 --> 02:22:03.420]  Look as his character is stabbed to death.
[02:22:03.420 --> 02:22:06.500]  Where is John Wilkes Booth when you need him?
[02:22:06.500 --> 02:22:11.500]  I have thought an awful lot about blowing up the White House.
[02:22:11.500 --> 02:22:17.620]  A Missouri State Senator is under investigation by the Secret Service after saying she hopes
[02:22:17.620 --> 02:22:19.740]  President Trump is assassinated.
[02:22:19.740 --> 02:22:22.580]  I will go and take Trump out tonight.
[02:22:22.580 --> 02:22:32.620]  And if you see anybody from that cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at
[02:22:32.620 --> 02:22:40.780]  a crowd, and you push back on them, and you tell them they're not welcome anymore,
[02:22:40.780 --> 02:22:41.780]  anywhere.
[02:22:41.780 --> 02:22:47.300]  And sadly, the domestic enemies to our voting system and our honoring our Constitution
[02:22:47.300 --> 02:22:51.340]  are right at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.
[02:22:51.340 --> 02:22:54.220]  They're not going to stop before election day in November and they're not going to
[02:22:54.220 --> 02:22:55.740]  stop after election day.
[02:22:55.740 --> 02:23:00.580]  And that should be, everyone should take note of that on both levels, that this isn't,
[02:23:00.580 --> 02:23:02.580]  they're not going to let up and they should not.
[02:23:02.580 --> 02:23:09.460]  If you think we're rallying now, you ain't seen nothing yet.
[02:23:09.460 --> 02:23:10.460]  That's right.
[02:23:10.460 --> 02:23:13.660]  And then we saw, of course, the riots take place all across the United States of
[02:23:13.660 --> 02:23:18.300]  America, billions of dollars of property damage, multiple murders, hundreds of police
[02:23:18.300 --> 02:23:26.340]  officers and citizens hospitalized.
[02:23:26.340 --> 02:23:27.340]  It's just unbelievable.
[02:23:27.340 --> 02:23:28.340]  Why?
[02:23:28.340 --> 02:23:29.340]  Why do you lie to yourselves?
[02:23:29.340 --> 02:23:31.340]  Why do you lie to the people?
[02:23:31.340 --> 02:23:33.260]  Just come out and be honest.
[02:23:33.260 --> 02:23:37.740]  Democrats are allowed to do whatever the hell they want, Republicans, everything you do
[02:23:37.740 --> 02:23:38.740]  is criminalized.
[02:23:38.740 --> 02:23:43.260]  Let's just, if you were honest about it, I'd have a little more respect for you.
[02:23:43.260 --> 02:23:48.100]  So I think Merrick Garland should release a statement saying, yes, Democrats are allowed
[02:23:48.100 --> 02:23:49.980]  to riot, Republicans are not.
[02:23:49.980 --> 02:23:54.900]  And of course, that's not even fair because Republicans don't riot.
[02:23:54.900 --> 02:23:58.980]  We'll even let them lie a little bit in their statements because they can't be
[02:23:58.980 --> 02:23:59.980]  fully honest.
[02:23:59.980 --> 02:24:03.700]  It's impossible for a Democrat to be fully honest.
[02:24:03.700 --> 02:24:08.220]  So no, Merrick Garland should come out and say, liberals, Democrats, progressives, we're
[02:24:08.220 --> 02:24:12.860]  allowed to do violence and riots and deny elections and we can do whatever the hell
[02:24:12.860 --> 02:24:13.860]  they want.
[02:24:13.860 --> 02:24:16.900]  But our opposition, if they do it, they will be criminalized.
[02:24:16.900 --> 02:24:19.220]  Just come out and say it.
[02:24:19.220 --> 02:24:21.780]  Just be honest about the state of things in this country.
[02:24:21.780 --> 02:24:22.980]  Stop lying to us.
[02:24:22.980 --> 02:24:29.180]  We know the truth.
[02:24:29.220 --> 02:24:33.020]  If Democrats call for violence because Trump is president, that's legal.
[02:24:33.020 --> 02:24:36.940]  If Owen Schroyer and Alex Jones try to stop people from committing violent acts,
[02:24:36.940 --> 02:24:39.780]  that's criminal, okay?
[02:24:39.780 --> 02:24:40.940]  That's the country we're in.
[02:24:40.940 --> 02:24:42.820]  That's Democrat party rule.
[02:24:42.820 --> 02:24:43.820]  Just say it.
[02:24:43.820 --> 02:24:46.100]  Just be honest.
[02:24:46.100 --> 02:24:55.860]  And I'm sure that the Biden administration denying Secret Service protection for RFK Jr.
[02:24:55.860 --> 02:24:58.740]  wasn't strategic.
[02:24:58.780 --> 02:25:04.220]  And now it looked like maybe somebody tried to make an attempt on his life, an armed man
[02:25:04.220 --> 02:25:11.860]  with loaded guns arrested impersonating RFK security team during an event in California.
[02:25:11.860 --> 02:25:15.220]  He was impersonating a security officer.
[02:25:15.220 --> 02:25:19.140]  RFK security team was on the ball and said, hey, this guy's not with us.
[02:25:19.140 --> 02:25:20.140]  So let's investigate him.
[02:25:20.140 --> 02:25:28.460]  They detained him and then he was arrested for impersonating an officer and falsely
[02:25:28.460 --> 02:25:37.540]  claiming to be a member of Kennedy security team when he wasn't.
[02:25:37.540 --> 02:25:43.580]  By the way, there was a powerful C-SPAN segment with RFK Jr. and a caller.
[02:25:43.580 --> 02:25:48.300]  I'm going to be covering that later on the war room.
[02:25:48.300 --> 02:25:50.120]  But so there you go.
[02:25:50.120 --> 02:25:56.020]  So Democrats can call for violence and engage in violence, and that's all perfectly fine.
[02:25:56.020 --> 02:26:00.560]  But if a conservative calls for peace, that's inciting a riot and you're going to jail.
[02:26:00.560 --> 02:26:02.580]  That's how they operate.
[02:26:02.580 --> 02:26:05.300]  All right.
[02:26:05.300 --> 02:26:07.100]  And it couldn't be more obvious, really, at this point.
[02:26:07.100 --> 02:26:08.100]  All right.
[02:26:08.100 --> 02:26:11.860]  Let's go quickly here before we get into the latest news with this continued resolution
[02:26:11.860 --> 02:26:13.000]  vote.
[02:26:13.000 --> 02:26:22.140]  Let's go to a special message from Alex Jones.
[02:26:22.140 --> 02:26:25.260]  Viewers and listeners have heard me for a long time.
[02:26:25.260 --> 02:26:29.300]  Talk about how amazing our products are, but our three best selling products over

[02:31:58.260 --> 02:32:02.260]  mfoolerstore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.

[02:32:10.500 --> 02:32:12.600]  What's better down and out?
[02:32:12.600 --> 02:32:13.600]  What's better?
[02:32:13.600 --> 02:32:15.320]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep eggs?
[02:32:15.320 --> 02:32:18.140]  And the answer is different herbal formulas.
[02:32:18.140 --> 02:32:20.920]  Different compounds are better for different people.
[02:32:20.920 --> 02:32:25.020]  So one person might like this coffee or the person likes that coffee.
[02:32:25.020 --> 02:32:26.220]  That's how our bodies work.
[02:32:26.220 --> 02:32:30.660]  They're all very diverse, but we've been able to private label a national bestseller

[02:33:03.900 --> 02:33:05.340]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:33:06.840 --> 02:33:13.840]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:33:13.840 --> 02:33:24.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show, and now your host, Owen Troyer.
[02:33:37.840 --> 02:33:44.840]  All right, we've got more here from Matt Gaetz on this continued resolution.
[02:33:44.840 --> 02:33:52.840]  Let me just quickly recap.
[02:33:52.840 --> 02:33:59.840]  You have 15 Republicans. This was the last update. I haven't seen a new update.
[02:33:59.840 --> 02:34:05.840]  15 Republicans refusing to vote for this continued resolution.
[02:34:05.840 --> 02:34:08.840]  Many familiar names. They're usually on the right side of these issues.
[02:34:08.840 --> 02:34:12.840]  Andy Biggs, Dan Bishop, Lauren Boebert.
[02:34:12.840 --> 02:34:14.840]  Yeah, there's that name, Lauren Boebert.
[02:34:14.840 --> 02:34:17.840]  And now conservatives are doing the Democrats' work of trying to get her out of Congress.
[02:34:17.840 --> 02:34:18.840]  Way to go, guys.
[02:34:18.840 --> 02:34:19.840]  Nice.
[02:34:19.840 --> 02:34:20.840]  Real good idea.
[02:34:20.840 --> 02:34:30.840]  Ken Buck, Kim Burchett, Eli Crane, Matt Gaetz, MTG, Corey Mills, Ralph Norman, Andy Ogles, Matt Rosendale, Victoria Spartz,
[02:34:30.840 --> 02:34:33.840]  Anna Paulina Luna, Paul Gosar.
[02:34:33.840 --> 02:34:40.840]  We've seen some pretty good statements from Matt Gaetz, Andy Ogles, Victoria Spartz.
[02:34:40.840 --> 02:34:43.840]  We've got more on it now.
[02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:47.840]  From Matt Gaetz, the 8 percent cut is only for 30 days.
[02:34:47.840 --> 02:34:50.840]  The border policy will be ignored by Biden.
[02:34:50.840 --> 02:34:55.840]  This continued resolution funds the election interference of Jack Smith.
[02:34:55.840 --> 02:35:01.840]  This is a terrible bill, lumping the funding of disparate agencies of government into one bad vote.
[02:35:01.840 --> 02:35:07.840]  This isn't what we fought for in January. It is the opposite, and it doesn't have the votes.
[02:35:07.840 --> 02:35:14.840]  Congressman Ogles, with exactly the right answer, single-subject spending bills.
[02:35:14.840 --> 02:35:19.840]  It is unfortunate that due to poor leadership, there will be a shutdown during this process.
[02:35:19.840 --> 02:35:25.840]  It will be painful, and the leaders who blew this deadline must be dealt with.
[02:35:25.840 --> 02:35:32.840]  But what is more painful is an immediate future with 2 trillion annual deficits atop a 32 trillion dollar debt,
[02:35:32.840 --> 02:35:39.840]  no more games, no more continued resolutions, single-subject spending bills, or bust.
[02:35:39.840 --> 02:35:47.840]  Now, I really don't know what the out here is for these 15 Republicans,
[02:35:47.840 --> 02:35:54.840]  because McCarthy's not going to budge, and obviously the Democrats are going to try to ram through whatever spending bill Biden wants.
[02:35:55.840 --> 02:36:01.840]  So you've got to start thinking outside the box, and you've got to start finding a way to get a victory.
[02:36:01.840 --> 02:36:10.840]  And if I'm these 15 Republicans, I'm thinking you either have two options,
[02:36:10.840 --> 02:36:12.840]  and really this is, I think, what it comes down to.
[02:36:12.840 --> 02:36:19.840]  You either have two options, and that's that you form this voter block that will stop the House from moving anything forward
[02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:27.840]  and shut down the government. I'm perfectly fine with that. Shut it down indefinitely, for all I care.
[02:36:27.840 --> 02:36:34.840]  I mean, the government's only trying to put my ass in jail and keep me on probation for 10 years, so I mean, hell.
[02:36:34.840 --> 02:36:40.840]  Yeah, the government that wants to arrest me and incarcerate me for my speech,
[02:36:40.840 --> 02:36:46.840]  oh no, it's going to be shut down, oh my gosh, oh, I'm heartbroken, oh, I'm crying.
[02:36:46.840 --> 02:36:57.840]  But aside from that, so either you decide you're going to be a voting block that's going to stall anything and shut down the government,
[02:36:57.840 --> 02:37:08.840]  or you decide it's time to bring the political long knives out against Kevin McCarthy,
[02:37:08.840 --> 02:37:15.840]  and you say, okay, I'll tell you what, McCarthy, if you want our votes on this continued resolution,
[02:37:15.840 --> 02:37:27.840]  then you put your career on the line. You say that this continued resolution will protect the southern border.
[02:37:27.840 --> 02:37:33.840]  You say that this continued resolution will block all funding to Ukraine.
[02:37:33.840 --> 02:37:41.840]  So then, put your money where your mouth is. If a single illegal immigrant crosses the border after this continued resolution,
[02:37:41.840 --> 02:37:52.840]  if a single penny is sent to Ukraine after this continued resolution, then Kevin McCarthy must resign as Speaker of the House.
[02:37:52.840 --> 02:37:59.840]  So then you know you're at least going to get that. Now, would McCarthy ever agree to that?
[02:37:59.840 --> 02:38:09.840]  Of course not, and that's the point. Proving Kevin McCarthy is lying when he says this bill will stop the illegal immigration
[02:38:09.840 --> 02:38:16.840]  and stop the funding to Ukraine. Then put your money where your mouth is, bud, but he won't do it because he knows it's a lie.
[02:38:16.840 --> 02:38:21.840]  I mean, hell, if you wanted to even go after Byron Donalds, well, I think he's one of the good guys.
[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:26.840]  You say the same thing to Byron Donalds. Say, Byron, if you really believe this is going to secure the southern border
[02:38:26.840 --> 02:38:33.840]  and stop funding the war in Ukraine, then you put your money where your mouth is and you'll resign the minute an illegal immigrant
[02:38:33.840 --> 02:38:40.840]  comes across this border and the minute a penny is sent to Ukraine after this continued resolution is voted for.
[02:38:40.840 --> 02:38:51.840]  But they're smarter than that. They're smarter than that. It's all illegal already anyway.
[02:38:51.840 --> 02:38:59.840]  Crossing all the illegal immigration is already illegal. It's already illegal anyway, and now we have to have
[02:38:59.840 --> 02:39:04.840]  we have to have negotiations in the House to decide whether we're going to keep allowing illegal immigrants or not.
[02:39:04.840 --> 02:39:17.840]  I mean, this thing is a joke. This whole Congress is a joke. Kevin McCarthy is an empty suit.
[02:39:17.840 --> 02:39:26.840]  And McCarthy at least has enough political wherewithal to support Donald Trump, but even that's probably fake.
[02:39:26.840 --> 02:39:36.840]  I wouldn't trust him, Donald. Federal judge again declares that DACA is illegal.
[02:39:36.840 --> 02:39:44.840]  So this thing has been declared illegal multiple times. But it just keeps happening. It just keeps happening.
[02:39:44.840 --> 02:39:53.840]  Los Angeles spends $44,000 per temporary tent in homeless village. Yeah.
[02:39:53.840 --> 02:39:58.840]  You know, I always wondered who's paying for these tents. We've got these massive tent cities in Austin, Texas.
[02:39:58.840 --> 02:40:04.840]  Very nice tents. We're talking like some of these tents, multiple hundreds of dollars, even thousand dollar, very nice tents.
[02:40:04.840 --> 02:40:10.840]  Where do the homeless get the money to afford these thousand dollar tents that they live in?
[02:40:11.840 --> 02:40:18.840]  Interesting. Catering services and 24 seven staffing costs an additional three million dollars per year.
[02:40:18.840 --> 02:40:28.840]  The Los Angeles Times is reporting. They get catering? Catering.
[02:40:28.840 --> 02:40:36.840]  Oh, whoa. So we oh, oh, and people will say, well.
[02:40:37.840 --> 02:40:44.840]  We can't send all the illegal immigrants home, there's just too many, we don't know what to do with them, but we know how to feed them, all right, don't we?
[02:40:44.840 --> 02:40:49.840]  We know how to make sure that they're fed and we know how to make sure they're accommodated as far as travel and lodging is concerned.
[02:40:49.840 --> 02:40:53.840]  But we certainly have no clue how to get them out of here, though, and that's just impossible.
[02:40:53.840 --> 02:40:56.840]  We don't know. But they're well fed and they've got a house to stay in if it's a tent.
[02:40:56.840 --> 02:41:00.840]  And, you know, they are catering 24 seven and everything else. But we have no idea.
[02:41:00.840 --> 02:41:09.840]  Well, there's no way we can get them out. Stunning videos from Mexico open train cars taking hordes of migrants to Biden's open U.S. border.
[02:41:09.840 --> 02:41:14.840]  Anything on that? Kevin McCarthy, you think you're going to stop that?
[02:41:14.840 --> 02:41:19.840]  Oh, it's just laughable. What a clown.
[02:41:19.840 --> 02:41:31.840]  UK health authorities erect biohazard tents following influx of sick migrants, sparks fears of deadly virus outbreak.
[02:41:31.840 --> 02:41:35.840]  But you need to take a vaccine. You need to wear a mask.
[02:41:35.840 --> 02:41:43.840]  And then hordes of illegal immigrants with all kinds of diseases pour across the southern border and you're supposed to just ignore that.
[02:41:43.840 --> 02:41:49.840]  Oh, yeah, I'm sure Biden will stop sending money to Ukraine.
[02:41:49.840 --> 02:41:55.840]  Zelensky fires six deputy defense ministers as corruption scandals surge in Ukraine.
[02:41:55.840 --> 02:42:00.840]  Yeah. Zelensky is firing all the people that are saying, hey, maybe we should reach a peace deal.
[02:42:00.840 --> 02:42:08.840]  We're losing hundreds of thousands of our citizens now. And, oh, you said that fired.
[02:42:08.840 --> 02:42:14.840]  Senator J.D. Vance demands Biden administration reveal of transgender spokesperson for Ukraine military has U.S.
[02:42:14.840 --> 02:42:18.840]  intelligence ties after threats to hunt down Russian propagandists.
[02:42:18.840 --> 02:42:25.840]  Folks, you can't make this up. This is not satire. This is not mad TV or in living color or Saturday Night Live.
[02:42:25.840 --> 02:42:35.840]  There is literally an American transgender individual that is the Ukrainian military spokesperson.
[02:42:35.840 --> 02:42:44.840]  You cannot make this up. This is clown world. We are in fully blown clown world.
[02:42:44.840 --> 02:42:47.840]  I mean, folks, it's like they don't even try to fake it.
[02:42:47.840 --> 02:42:52.840]  It'd be like me up here in a wig and a beard telling you I'm a female athlete.
[02:42:52.840 --> 02:42:56.840]  Nobody would buy that.
[02:42:56.840 --> 02:43:02.840]  Separately, we got some really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really good news.
[02:43:02.840 --> 02:43:05.840]  Because it's a great product you love and people want it.
[02:43:05.840 --> 02:43:08.840]  And it funds our Operation 360 win bodies.

[02:43:55.390 --> 02:44:03.269]  Iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire
[02:44:03.269 --> 02:44:04.910]  food supply.
[02:44:04.910 --> 02:44:09.750]  Modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[02:44:09.750 --> 02:44:13.949]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population.
[02:44:13.949 --> 02:44:16.769]  And there are two things we need to do about it.
[02:44:16.769 --> 02:44:20.109]  We need to practice more regenerative farming.
[02:44:20.109 --> 02:44:25.330]  There are plenty of proven technologies in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally
[02:44:25.369 --> 02:44:28.609]  keep the soil rich with iodine.
[02:44:28.609 --> 02:44:34.730]  And we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day, derived from ancient
[02:44:34.730 --> 02:44:39.050]  sea salts found thousands of feet below the Earth's surface.
[02:44:39.050 --> 02:44:44.849]  Our Infowars Life Survival Shield X3 is hands down the best.
[02:44:44.849 --> 02:44:51.010]  Pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form.

[02:44:58.170 --> 02:45:05.330]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be obtained through
[02:45:05.330 --> 02:45:06.330]  diet.
[02:45:06.330 --> 02:45:11.449]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban
[02:45:11.449 --> 02:45:12.449]  it.
[02:45:12.449 --> 02:45:17.050]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of omega-3s.
[02:45:17.050 --> 02:45:23.090]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[02:45:23.090 --> 02:45:30.849]  Your best option is our ultimate fish oil and ultimate krill oil at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:45:30.849 --> 02:45:37.289]  Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for both our neurological and cardiovascular systems,

[02:46:57.200 --> 02:47:05.880]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:47:07.300 --> 02:47:23.220]  So in case you haven't noticed, our country is under attack and Joe Biden is facilitating
[02:47:23.220 --> 02:47:24.480]  all of it.
[02:47:24.480 --> 02:47:27.699]  That was the entire purpose of getting him in office, actually.
[02:47:27.699 --> 02:47:31.980]  Compromised by the Chinese, compromised by the Russians, compromised by Ukraine.
[02:47:31.980 --> 02:47:34.539]  That's the Biden crime family.
[02:47:34.539 --> 02:47:37.900]  And so this story is wild.
[02:47:37.900 --> 02:47:43.460]  And you know, really, I probably should have made a bigger deal of this today.
[02:47:43.460 --> 02:47:45.160]  But there's just so many other news stories.
[02:47:45.160 --> 02:47:46.160]  It's hard.
[02:47:46.160 --> 02:47:49.679]  Like I said, we're on a merry-go-round except the lever's broken, the brakes are broken,
[02:47:49.679 --> 02:47:50.900]  the governor's off.
[02:47:50.900 --> 02:47:51.900]  There's no getting off.
[02:47:51.900 --> 02:47:53.179]  You can't even focus on anything.
[02:47:53.179 --> 02:47:54.779]  It's spinning so fast.
[02:47:54.779 --> 02:47:57.199]  And there's all kinds of clown horns going off all around you.
[02:47:57.199 --> 02:48:01.140]  So the noise interference is a bit of an issue.
[02:48:01.140 --> 02:48:04.660]  How do you lose an F-35?
[02:48:04.660 --> 02:48:09.060]  U.S. military can't find stealth jet after mishap.
[02:48:09.060 --> 02:48:15.599]  Pilot ejected safely from F-35B Lightning II, but there were no immediate crash reports.
[02:48:15.599 --> 02:48:20.500]  Military expert says the F-35 could likely travel hundreds of miles without its pilot.
[02:48:20.500 --> 02:48:23.660]  South Carolina Republican representative made a statement saying, how in the hell do you
[02:48:23.660 --> 02:48:25.000]  use an F-35?
[02:48:25.000 --> 02:48:26.859]  How is there not a tracking device?
[02:48:26.859 --> 02:48:29.740]  And we're asking the public to find what?
[02:48:29.740 --> 02:48:32.660]  The jet and turn it in?
[02:48:32.660 --> 02:48:40.439]  Now look, I'm not somebody that has the military background to answer the obvious question,
[02:48:40.439 --> 02:48:43.820]  which is how does it not have a tracking device on it?
[02:48:43.820 --> 02:48:44.820]  Maybe it does.
[02:48:44.820 --> 02:48:45.820]  Maybe it doesn't.
[02:48:45.820 --> 02:48:48.599]  Maybe we really make these things stealth so that we can't even track our own pilots.
[02:48:48.599 --> 02:48:50.980]  I don't know that.
[02:48:50.980 --> 02:48:53.420]  Maybe we'll take calls on that later this afternoon.
[02:48:53.420 --> 02:48:55.060]  I will be hosting the war room.
[02:48:55.060 --> 02:49:00.580]  But now this story gets a lot worse and more interesting.
[02:49:00.580 --> 02:49:04.939]  And now it reeks of intentional sabotage.
[02:49:04.939 --> 02:49:13.740]  It's being reported that this jet has landed in Cuba.
[02:49:13.740 --> 02:49:19.980]  This is the latest report is that it has apparently landed in Cuba.
[02:49:19.980 --> 02:49:21.279]  Now this whole thing is wild.
[02:49:21.279 --> 02:49:25.560]  The story could change 10 times before I even sign off the air today later at six
[02:49:25.560 --> 02:49:28.560]  o'clock.
[02:49:28.560 --> 02:49:36.000]  But let's think about the ramifications of this.
[02:49:36.000 --> 02:49:43.039]  China has military installments and bases in Cuba.
[02:49:43.039 --> 02:49:57.279]  The F-35 is one of our most important aircraft technologies that we possess.
[02:49:57.279 --> 02:50:08.240]  Now you tell me how an F-35 goes rogue and then potentially lands where there is
[02:50:08.240 --> 02:50:13.340]  a Chinese military installment?
[02:50:13.340 --> 02:50:17.480]  And I'm supposed to believe that this is all organic and the US government doesn't
[02:50:17.480 --> 02:50:23.039]  even know what the hell is going on?
[02:50:23.039 --> 02:50:26.480]  This is nuts.
[02:50:26.480 --> 02:50:30.080]  This is nuts.
[02:50:30.080 --> 02:50:36.160]  So again, I can't leap to any conclusions because I don't have the military intelligence
[02:50:36.160 --> 02:50:40.660]  to say, oh, we can absolutely track that plane and knew it all along or no, we can't
[02:50:40.660 --> 02:50:45.840]  track that plane and really it probably is off our radar.
[02:50:45.840 --> 02:50:50.279]  I don't know.
[02:50:50.279 --> 02:50:55.119]  And maybe we will just open up the phone lines on the war room for people that have
[02:50:55.119 --> 02:50:58.199]  that military intelligence or maybe even try to get a military guest on.
[02:50:58.199 --> 02:51:00.560]  I know I do have some other guests coming up and there's a bunch of other news to
[02:51:00.560 --> 02:51:04.199]  cover, but I mean, folks, I mean, this is just ridiculous.
[02:51:04.240 --> 02:51:07.720]  Our country is being attacked.
[02:51:07.720 --> 02:51:14.640]  It's I mean, the first amendment under attack, the second amendment under attack, Joe Biden
[02:51:14.640 --> 02:51:19.519]  attacking the American people with inflation and high energy prices and high taxes.
[02:51:19.519 --> 02:51:21.660]  The wide open southern border.
[02:51:21.660 --> 02:51:29.720]  Our military is run by sexually confused, deranged liberal progressives.
[02:51:29.720 --> 02:51:33.240]  I mean, I'd love to chalk this up to incompetence.
[02:51:33.279 --> 02:51:38.420]  I'd love to talk this missing F-35 up to incompetence and just say, yeah, you know what?
[02:51:38.420 --> 02:51:43.439]  We got a military that's more concerned about dressing up as dogs for a sex kink that
[02:51:43.439 --> 02:51:48.880]  they have and making sure the government funds chopping off their balls.
[02:51:48.880 --> 02:51:52.820]  And so, yeah, and F-35 goes missing because our military is thinking about how to chop
[02:51:52.820 --> 02:51:58.560]  up balls and dress like leather daddy dog kink.
[02:51:58.560 --> 02:52:02.199]  I mean, oh, yeah, I'd love to chalk that up to incompetence.
[02:52:02.199 --> 02:52:03.480]  And certainly there's a level of it.
[02:52:03.480 --> 02:52:17.320]  But no, this, this, this, you know, the Clintons sold nuclear secrets to the Chinese, right?
[02:52:17.320 --> 02:52:28.160]  You know, Joe Biden left a bunch of technology and bio and bio data in Afghanistan, right?
[02:52:28.160 --> 02:52:32.080]  You know, Barack Obama gave Iran our drone technology, right?
[02:52:32.080 --> 02:52:39.880]  Which Russia and China now also have access to.
[02:52:39.880 --> 02:52:50.960]  And now, and now it appears that China has made off with a US F-35.
[02:52:50.960 --> 02:52:58.960]  I mean, I shouldn't be laughing, but this is gallows humor at this point.
[02:52:58.960 --> 02:53:01.160]  I mean, I want to see it.
[02:53:01.240 --> 02:53:05.880]  Seriously, maybe we should just go full SNL at this point and I should just come on the
[02:53:05.880 --> 02:53:10.400]  war room today and I should just be, I'll dress up as a, as a, as a leather daddy
[02:53:10.400 --> 02:53:15.199]  dog kink military general.
[02:53:15.199 --> 02:53:16.759]  And I've been neutered.
[02:53:16.759 --> 02:53:17.759]  Yeah.
[02:53:17.759 --> 02:53:24.720]  Hi, I'm, uh, I'm, I'm general spike.
[02:53:24.720 --> 02:53:31.000]  I'm general sparky spike from the leather dog kink branch of the US military.
[02:53:31.000 --> 02:53:37.960]  Happy here to tell you I am agender neutered and we are missing an F-35 and we have no
[02:53:37.960 --> 02:53:41.000]  idea where it is, but I have no balls.
[02:53:41.000 --> 02:53:43.080]  Look at my dog mask.
[02:53:43.080 --> 02:53:49.720]  I'm the leader of the military.
[02:53:49.720 --> 02:53:54.000]  Joe Biden also gave Iran $6 billion today.
[02:53:54.000 --> 02:53:59.840]  Five Americans freed from Iranian prison as US hands $6 billion over and controversial
[02:53:59.840 --> 02:54:00.840]  deal.
[02:54:00.880 --> 02:54:01.880]  I'll be honest here.
[02:54:01.880 --> 02:54:09.800]  This, this is, this is difficult because part of me says we got to bring prisoners
[02:54:09.800 --> 02:54:12.080]  abroad home at all costs.
[02:54:12.080 --> 02:54:18.800]  I don't know if at all costs is fair to say, but I mean, I think it's fair to
[02:54:18.800 --> 02:54:20.160]  say this.
[02:54:20.160 --> 02:54:23.279]  We should have got a better deal.
[02:54:23.279 --> 02:54:27.640]  Now I'm not going to complain that the Biden administration brought prisoners home.
[02:54:27.640 --> 02:54:29.840]  Not going to do that.
[02:54:29.840 --> 02:54:35.400]  I can't even imagine for them and their families how important this is.
[02:54:35.400 --> 02:54:44.920]  These dual citizens, but, um, you know, you just get the feeling that five prisoners
[02:54:44.920 --> 02:54:50.000]  for two and $6 billion should have been a better deal for the US somehow.
[02:54:50.000 --> 02:54:51.640]  But we just get raked over the coals.
[02:54:51.640 --> 02:54:54.679]  Every deal Biden makes is bad for us.
[02:54:54.679 --> 02:54:58.400]  But Hey, I'm not going to not celebrate bringing American prisoners home.
[02:54:58.400 --> 02:55:03.080]  But again, it seems that our president has no negotiating skills whatsoever.
[02:55:03.080 --> 02:55:05.240]  And now there's an F 35 missing.
[02:55:05.240 --> 02:55:10.599]  And then Tom cotton, who's been one of the good ones.
[02:55:10.599 --> 02:55:12.279]  People are wondering what happened to him.
[02:55:12.279 --> 02:55:15.840]  All of a sudden he's flopped on the Ukraine issue.
[02:55:15.840 --> 02:55:19.679]  I wrote to president Biden with my colleagues and urged him to provide Ukraine with the
[02:55:19.679 --> 02:55:21.920]  missiles.
[02:55:21.920 --> 02:55:24.740]  It's military needs to win.
[02:55:24.740 --> 02:55:25.960]  You can give them all the missiles in the world.
[02:55:25.960 --> 02:55:26.960]  They won't win.
[02:55:26.960 --> 02:55:29.480]  And doing so will only prolong the war and cost lives.
[02:55:29.480 --> 02:55:31.000]  I mean, that's just completely inaccurate.
[02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:32.000]  He knows that.
[02:55:32.000 --> 02:55:35.720]  So now people think Tom cotton has been blackmailed because of this flip flop.
[02:55:35.720 --> 02:55:44.199]  And now voting with Lindsey Graham on war, everybody assumes Lindsey Graham has, um,
[02:55:44.199 --> 02:55:47.800]  maybe spent some time intimately with other men or something.
[02:55:47.800 --> 02:55:50.240]  And that's why he's blackmailed into all this stuff.
[02:55:50.240 --> 02:55:55.240]  I don't, I don't know the flip flop from Tom cotton has people asking these questions
[02:55:55.560 --> 02:56:01.560]  and uh, no, Tom, you can give the Ukrainian military every missile that we have in our
[02:56:01.560 --> 02:56:04.240]  arsenal and it's still will not win them the war.
[02:56:04.240 --> 02:56:06.359]  It will not get any closer to ending a war.
[02:56:06.359 --> 02:56:08.000]  It will only prolonging the war.
[02:56:08.000 --> 02:56:13.560]  And because of your outright misrepresentation of this, now people think you're blackmailed,
[02:56:13.560 --> 02:56:20.400]  uh, and maybe in a Lindsey Graham type situation, does he spend the night there at, um,
[02:56:20.400 --> 02:56:24.720]  what's that, uh, that house, that apartment in DC that they all like to snuggle up
[02:56:24.720 --> 02:56:34.960]  under the covers and with that, uh, Democrat pollster, Frank Luntz, they all, they all
[02:56:34.960 --> 02:56:39.519]  get, they all get nice and huddled up around the fire with Frank Luntz.
[02:56:39.519 --> 02:56:43.039]  Maybe Tom cotton, maybe he's going to be joining them.
[02:56:43.039 --> 02:56:44.920]  All right.
[02:56:44.920 --> 02:56:53.320]  The Alex Jones show rolls on the other side of this break with the great Gerald Salente,
[02:56:53.320 --> 02:56:59.400]  the great trends forecaster, the great American, always fired up.
[02:56:59.400 --> 02:57:02.759]  I will be returning to host the war room.
[02:57:02.759 --> 02:57:06.519]  We've got a couple guests coming up and, and I may have to call an audible cause
[02:57:06.519 --> 02:57:12.039]  I had a ton of news already scheduled on the Paxton impeachment and, and some other
[02:57:12.039 --> 02:57:17.320]  big news and video clips, but, but this situation with the F 35 jet might need to be
[02:57:17.320 --> 02:57:20.080]  addressed head on.
[02:57:20.080 --> 02:57:24.800]  And so we may just end up taking calls from the military because I just don't have the
[02:57:24.800 --> 02:57:25.800]  experience.
[02:57:25.800 --> 02:57:28.039]  I mean, could the F 35 literally be untrackable and traceable.
[02:57:28.039 --> 02:57:32.720]  It might be, it's hard to believe, but that could be the case, but then it apparently
[02:57:32.720 --> 02:57:36.880]  lands in Cuba right next to a Chinese military installment.
[02:57:36.880 --> 02:57:38.240]  Oh, okay.
[02:57:38.240 --> 02:57:39.240]  But don't say anything.
[02:57:39.240 --> 02:57:41.039]  Joe Biden, best president ever.
[02:57:41.039 --> 02:57:42.039]  We're so safe.
[02:57:42.039 --> 02:57:43.160]  We're so secure under Joe Biden.
[02:57:43.160 --> 02:57:47.279]  He just gives our military secrets to every country that asked for him.
[02:57:47.279 --> 02:57:48.759]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[02:57:48.759 --> 02:57:49.759]  I thought it was next week.
[02:57:50.439 --> 02:57:51.439]  It's coming this morning.
[02:57:51.439 --> 02:57:56.320]  It's back in the warehouse, ready to roll body's ultimate every formula.
[02:57:56.320 --> 02:58:02.080]  And the first thing I did was pop one of these bad boys overhead shot, please.
[02:58:02.080 --> 02:58:06.320]  Look how full this bottle is.
[02:58:06.320 --> 02:58:15.820]  Right to the top folks, right to the top with these 95% could humanoid again, most
[02:58:15.820 --> 02:58:19.179]  Timmerick formulas are 5%, some are maybe 10.
[02:58:19.179 --> 02:58:21.939]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[02:58:21.939 --> 02:58:26.019]  This is 95%.
[02:58:26.019 --> 02:58:27.019]  Super constant.
[02:58:27.019 --> 02:58:31.980]  So like taking one pills, like taking 10 of the average bill, it's that powerful
[02:58:31.980 --> 02:58:32.980]  or more.
[02:58:32.980 --> 02:58:37.019]  So they're available at info war store.com.
[02:58:37.019 --> 02:58:41.939]  Body's ultimate Timmerick formula hold off for almost eight months back in stock at

[02:59:49.220 --> 02:59:55.340]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the new world order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:00:07.859 --> 03:00:15.900]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[03:00:15.900 --> 03:00:21.619]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show with Gerald Cilente.
[03:00:21.619 --> 03:00:30.980]  It's great being on the Alex Jones Show and it's terrible what they're doing to Owen
[03:00:30.980 --> 03:00:38.500]  and anybody that speaks out against the crime syndicate that people call the government
[03:00:38.500 --> 03:00:42.420]  and it's really, really terrible and as I said, you better do everything you can to
[03:00:42.420 --> 03:00:47.259]  support info wars because they're going to try to get rid of everybody they can.
[03:00:47.259 --> 03:00:54.099]  I'm wondering what they're going to come up with with me, you know?
[03:00:54.099 --> 03:00:58.699]  You get these things, you know, somebody who says sexual harassment that happened, you
[03:00:58.699 --> 03:01:07.220]  know, a decade ago and they believe what the woman says but whether there's no proof
[03:01:07.220 --> 03:01:13.420]  or anything and the guys get chastised for it, you know?
[03:01:13.420 --> 03:01:14.420]  It's terrible.
[03:01:14.420 --> 03:01:21.500]  Yeah, there's crazy guys that abuse women but, you know, there's two sides to a lot
[03:01:21.500 --> 03:01:29.420]  of stories and so they'll do anything they can to get rid of the people that are making
[03:01:29.420 --> 03:01:35.179]  the news and changing it that's out of the mainstream gauntlet.
[03:01:35.179 --> 03:01:36.179]  So who knows?
[03:01:36.179 --> 03:01:42.539]  I'm telling you, women try to get in touch with me, you know, Mr. Cilente, I am concerned.
[03:01:42.539 --> 03:01:48.599]  I'm totally concerned about meeting somebody that I don't know and you meet somebody
[03:01:48.599 --> 03:01:54.279]  that you don't know and being accused of something.
[03:01:54.800 --> 03:02:04.800]  And so it's very, very, very disturbing, like what's going on with this Russell Brand.
[03:02:04.800 --> 03:02:11.080]  They're branding him this because he's come out against the establishment so deeply.
[03:02:11.080 --> 03:02:15.779]  Like I've said, I've never raised my hand to a woman unless she wanted to be spanked.
[03:02:15.779 --> 03:02:16.779]  Take it easy.
[03:02:16.779 --> 03:02:17.779]  It's a joke.
[03:02:17.779 --> 03:02:21.519]  No woman ever wants to be spanked.
[03:02:21.519 --> 03:02:22.519]  Take it easy.
[03:02:23.240 --> 03:02:30.840]  You know, I go to Infowars all the time and the stories that they're running about, like
[03:02:30.840 --> 03:02:36.359]  RFK Jr., what he's saying, and I said this in the beginning, it was Alex Jones, I think
[03:02:36.359 --> 03:02:45.320]  I believe I said it in January, that the best candidate for president would be RFK Jr.
[03:02:45.320 --> 03:02:52.039]  and Judge Napolitano, the vice president, RFK Jr. for president, and I've been saying
[03:02:52.039 --> 03:02:57.400]  he should run on the libertarian ticket because much of what he says is in the libertarian
[03:02:57.400 --> 03:02:59.080]  consciousness.
[03:02:59.080 --> 03:03:00.080]  And I'm a political atheist.
[03:03:00.080 --> 03:03:02.080]  I don't belong to a party.
[03:03:02.080 --> 03:03:03.080]  It's not a party.
[03:03:03.080 --> 03:03:04.080]  It's a crime syndicate.
[03:03:04.080 --> 03:03:07.960]  And look at the slimeballs that are in charge.
[03:03:07.960 --> 03:03:10.080]  Look at the slimeballs that are in charge.
[03:03:10.080 --> 03:03:12.240]  How could you be so damn stupid?
[03:03:12.240 --> 03:03:13.720]  How can you be so stupid?
[03:03:13.800 --> 03:03:22.320]  How can you be so stupid to look up to a little, out of his mind, Mitch McConnell?
[03:03:22.320 --> 03:03:25.000]  Oh, no, he didn't freeze.
[03:03:25.000 --> 03:03:26.000]  He didn't have a seizure.
[03:03:26.000 --> 03:03:28.000]  Oh, what, is he like that normally?
[03:03:28.000 --> 03:03:30.039]  Yeah, he's like that normally.
[03:03:30.039 --> 03:03:32.560]  The guy's out of his mind.
[03:03:32.560 --> 03:03:36.800]  Biden can't finish his sentence, doesn't know what he's talking about.
[03:03:36.800 --> 03:03:43.720]  Oh, and he just BS'd that he was a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, and he
[03:03:43.720 --> 03:03:44.720]  didn't teach.
[03:03:44.720 --> 03:03:45.720]  Oh, he misspoke.
[03:03:45.720 --> 03:03:49.960]  He lied, or he's out of his mind.
[03:03:49.960 --> 03:03:52.720]  It's a freak show.
[03:03:52.720 --> 03:03:56.720]  So anyway, what they have on Infowars, they're giving you all this great information.
[03:03:56.720 --> 03:04:00.160]  And it's very important that you support them.
[03:04:00.160 --> 03:04:01.400]  And they got great products.
[03:04:01.400 --> 03:04:06.720]  When you support them, you're supporting yourself against that 360 win.
[03:04:06.720 --> 03:04:09.519]  You know, we're going to get into a lot of things that are going on.
[03:04:09.519 --> 03:04:13.599]  And this economy, man, it's over.
[03:04:13.599 --> 03:04:16.599]  The facts are there.
[03:04:16.599 --> 03:04:18.519]  We're reporting them weekly.
[03:04:18.519 --> 03:04:22.359]  We've been ahead of the trends beyond anybody.
[03:04:22.359 --> 03:04:30.960]  Nobody's talking about the office building bust, 47% office occupancy rate in the 10 largest
[03:04:30.960 --> 03:04:32.279]  cities in America.
[03:04:32.279 --> 03:04:37.920]  That's according to Castle Systems with a K, not making it up.
[03:04:37.920 --> 03:04:42.960]  All the businesses that depended on commuters, going out of business.
[03:04:42.960 --> 03:04:47.640]  And yeah, and all those vacant offices, it's going to be fine.
[03:04:47.640 --> 03:04:52.199]  The banking crisis that's coming is going to be the worst in American history.
[03:04:52.199 --> 03:04:53.199]  Stay tuned.
[03:04:53.199 --> 03:04:57.840]  Much more to come.
[03:04:57.840 --> 03:05:02.599]  When I tell you we have the ultimate bone broth, hands down, this is the most concentrated,
[03:05:02.599 --> 03:05:05.460]  high quality bone broth there is.
[03:05:05.460 --> 03:05:10.679]  Concentrated chicken broth, patented amazing, then a huge dose of chaga mushroom, a massive
[03:05:10.679 --> 03:05:16.599]  dose of bee pollen, a gigantic dose of highest quality turmeric, and then it just gets crazier
[03:05:16.599 --> 03:05:17.759]  from there.
[03:05:17.759 --> 03:05:18.900]  It's about to sell out.
[03:05:18.900 --> 03:05:20.439]  We haven't had it in stock for years.
[03:05:20.439 --> 03:05:22.400]  This first new run is about to sell out.

[03:06:26.259 --> 03:06:30.259]  All right, we're going to talk about what in the world is going on, and what's next.
[03:06:30.259 --> 03:06:34.259]  This is from the toilet paper record to New York Pines.
[03:06:34.259 --> 03:06:36.259]  They call themselves the paper record.
[03:06:36.259 --> 03:06:39.259]  For me, it's just a piece of crap.
[03:06:39.259 --> 03:06:43.259]  Big story in the front, right?
[03:06:43.259 --> 03:06:46.259]  Calling for climate pivot.
[03:06:46.259 --> 03:06:53.259]  Thousands of New York City start demanding that the world leaders stop fossil fuel drilling.
[03:06:53.259 --> 03:06:58.259]  Hey, how come all you clowns don't show up for our peace rallies?
[03:06:58.259 --> 03:07:00.259]  What do you got, Lockjaw?
[03:07:00.259 --> 03:07:02.259]  You worried about climate change?
[03:07:02.259 --> 03:07:10.259]  Hey, I know you love that depleted uranium that the United States is sending to Ukraine.
[03:07:10.259 --> 03:07:14.259]  Oh, you just love to swallow it.
[03:07:14.259 --> 03:07:18.259]  How about those cluster bombs, you cluster S?
[03:07:18.259 --> 03:07:21.259]  You like them, don't you?
[03:07:21.259 --> 03:07:28.259]  Oh, yeah, the war going on in Ukraine, all the bombs exploding, all the poison in the world.
[03:07:28.259 --> 03:07:31.259]  Oh, but you got Lockjaw about that.
[03:07:31.259 --> 03:07:32.259]  You know why?
[03:07:32.259 --> 03:07:35.259]  Because you're a bunch of cowards.
[03:07:35.259 --> 03:07:38.259]  You're a bunch of little cowards.
[03:07:38.259 --> 03:07:40.259]  Climate change?
[03:07:40.259 --> 03:07:46.259]  Hey, you like those other chemicals that the big companies put in our everything?
[03:07:46.259 --> 03:07:47.259]  I know.
[03:07:47.259 --> 03:07:52.259]  All the obesity in America with your ultra-processed foods.
[03:07:52.259 --> 03:07:53.259]  There you go.
[03:07:53.259 --> 03:07:55.259]  Worried about climate change?
[03:07:55.259 --> 03:07:56.259]  Don't worry.
[03:07:56.259 --> 03:07:58.259]  Nuclear war is coming.
[03:07:58.259 --> 03:08:00.259]  Nuclear war is coming.
[03:08:00.259 --> 03:08:02.259]  You got freaks in charge.
[03:08:02.259 --> 03:08:05.259]  You got freaks in charge.
[03:08:05.259 --> 03:08:06.259]  You ready?
[03:08:06.259 --> 03:08:08.259]  Not making us up.
[03:08:08.259 --> 03:08:10.259]  Nuclear war is coming.
[03:08:10.259 --> 03:08:12.259]  And the freak in charge?
[03:08:12.259 --> 03:08:13.259]  And I got to be careful.
[03:08:13.259 --> 03:08:19.259]  You know, they may try to kill me because of what I say and how I say it.
[03:08:19.259 --> 03:08:27.259]  There's this article over here, again, in the toilet paper record.
[03:08:27.259 --> 03:08:32.259]  How Biden's view of presidential military authority is broadened.
[03:08:32.259 --> 03:08:37.259]  Biden's view of presidential military authority is broadened.
[03:08:37.259 --> 03:08:41.259]  To Joe Biden, I got five draft affirmments.
[03:08:41.259 --> 03:08:44.259]  Biden's only three years older than me.
[03:08:44.259 --> 03:08:49.259]  I was that part of that thing when the Vietnam War was going on.
[03:08:49.259 --> 03:08:52.259]  And as I said, I was too stupid.
[03:08:52.259 --> 03:08:55.259]  I swallowed the crap and believed the baloney.
[03:08:55.259 --> 03:08:59.259]  Just like the people believe it now with Russia, that if we don't stop them Russians,
[03:08:59.259 --> 03:09:01.259]  they're going to be all over Europe.
[03:09:01.259 --> 03:09:03.259]  They said the same thing with Vietnam.
[03:09:03.259 --> 03:09:08.259]  If we don't stop those commies, those dominoes are going to keep falling.
[03:09:08.259 --> 03:09:10.259]  And all our aliens will become communists.
[03:09:10.259 --> 03:09:14.259]  And those dominoes will hit the shores of California, not making that up.
[03:09:14.259 --> 03:09:16.259]  So I believed it.
[03:09:16.259 --> 03:09:18.259]  But I did everything I could to avoid the drift.
[03:09:18.259 --> 03:09:20.259]  I don't want to get shot.
[03:09:20.259 --> 03:09:25.259]  You see these guys walking toward this side, gowns over their head, 50, 60 pounds of weight
[03:09:25.259 --> 03:09:27.259]  on their back and getting shot.
[03:09:27.259 --> 03:09:28.259]  I said, I don't want to do this.
[03:09:28.259 --> 03:09:30.259]  So I admit it.
[03:09:30.259 --> 03:09:33.259]  I did everything I could to stay out of the draft.
[03:09:33.259 --> 03:09:35.259]  I didn't want to go to college.
[03:09:35.259 --> 03:09:40.259]  Out of college, I want to open up a delegate test in the park, Chester, in the Bronx.
[03:09:40.259 --> 03:09:41.259]  I go to my father.
[03:09:41.259 --> 03:09:42.259]  I said, Dad, what should I do?
[03:09:42.259 --> 03:09:43.259]  They drafted everybody.
[03:09:43.259 --> 03:09:45.259]  He said to me, listen, I got my own problems.
[03:09:45.259 --> 03:09:46.259]  I taught you enough.
[03:09:46.259 --> 03:09:47.259]  You figure it out.
[03:09:48.259 --> 03:09:51.259]  I got the second stupidest school in America, the only place I could get into.
[03:09:51.259 --> 03:09:54.259]  I barely got out of high school to avoid the draft.
[03:09:54.259 --> 03:09:58.259]  But Biden, five draft deferments.
[03:09:58.259 --> 03:10:03.259]  And then when they ran out, he got another one.
[03:10:03.259 --> 03:10:05.259]  You know what?
[03:10:05.259 --> 03:10:08.259]  He had asthma as a teenager.
[03:10:08.259 --> 03:10:12.259]  Oh, this is the guy that bragged with a great athlete he was in college?
[03:10:12.259 --> 03:10:15.259]  But he can't go fight in Vietnam?
[03:10:15.259 --> 03:10:16.259]  Yeah.
[03:10:16.259 --> 03:10:17.259]  So here's the article.
[03:10:17.600 --> 03:10:25.780]  If elected to a second term, President Biden pledged he would go to Congress to start any
[03:10:25.780 --> 03:10:35.220]  major war, but said he believed he, he, the guy that's out of his mind, was empowered
[03:10:35.220 --> 03:10:48.500]  to quote, to direct limited U.S. military operations abroad, why that's sexist abroad, abroad, end
[03:10:48.500 --> 03:10:51.100]  quote, without such approval.
[03:10:51.300 --> 03:11:01.660]  When such strikes served critical American interests, you mean like stealing oil out
[03:11:01.660 --> 03:11:02.660]  of Syria?
[03:11:02.660 --> 03:11:05.660]  No, no, how about getting it out of Libya?
[03:11:05.660 --> 03:11:14.259]  I forgot a rock, Halliburton, the one that that slimeball was on, I can't say the word,
[03:11:14.259 --> 03:11:18.740]  I don't want to be censored, penis Cheney?
[03:11:18.740 --> 03:11:24.560]  They call him Dick Cheney, or Halliburton, you think we would have went into Iraq if
[03:11:24.560 --> 03:11:27.259]  their major export was broccoli?
[03:11:27.259 --> 03:11:29.179]  That's America's interests?
[03:11:29.179 --> 03:11:36.400]  No Biden, America only goes to war when we are threatened directly.
[03:11:36.400 --> 03:11:47.140]  As the founding fathers had made clear, goes on, quote, as president, I have taken
[03:11:47.140 --> 03:11:56.820]  great care to ensure that military actions carried out under my command, under my command?
[03:11:56.820 --> 03:12:03.320]  You are just a little slave of America, I am in command, I will take you to war, I will
[03:12:03.320 --> 03:12:05.179]  kill anybody that I want.
[03:12:05.300 --> 03:12:14.880]  Carried out under my command, comply with this constitutional framework and that my administration
[03:12:14.880 --> 03:12:19.900]  consults with Congress to the greatest extent possible, he wrote in response to the New
[03:12:19.900 --> 03:12:21.720]  York Times survey.
[03:12:21.720 --> 03:12:28.000]  I will continue to rigorously apply this framework to any potential actions in the
[03:12:28.000 --> 03:12:29.000]  future.
[03:12:29.000 --> 03:12:30.000]  You ready?
[03:12:30.000 --> 03:12:38.420]  The reply stood in contrast to his answer in 2007 when he was running for president, like
[03:12:38.420 --> 03:12:44.660]  they all do, they lie their way into office if they can get in, when he was also running
[03:12:44.660 --> 03:12:46.320]  for president.
[03:12:46.320 --> 03:12:56.240]  Quote, the Constitution is clear except in response to an attack or the imminent threat
[03:12:56.240 --> 03:13:08.560]  of attack, only Congress may authorize war and the use of force, end quote.
[03:13:08.560 --> 03:13:12.880]  One little clown taking us out to war after another.
[03:13:12.880 --> 03:13:19.640]  One little clown, I forgot, the Nobel piece of crap prize winner, Barack Obama.
[03:13:19.640 --> 03:13:23.599]  Hey, you see what's going on in Syria?
[03:13:23.599 --> 03:13:27.119]  Only about 11,000 people have died from the floods.
[03:13:27.119 --> 03:13:31.160]  Oh, yeah, oh, toilet paper record.
[03:13:31.160 --> 03:13:32.160]  Here it is.
[03:13:32.160 --> 03:13:33.160]  Here's the flood.
[03:13:33.160 --> 03:13:34.160]  You ready?
[03:13:34.160 --> 03:13:37.039]  Libya ignored dire warnings about its dams.
[03:13:37.039 --> 03:13:38.039]  Damn it.
[03:13:38.039 --> 03:13:39.220]  You know why?
[03:13:39.220 --> 03:13:43.759]  Because they slaughtered Gaddafi.
[03:13:43.759 --> 03:13:47.240]  Libya was the most, the richest country in Africa.
[03:13:47.240 --> 03:13:52.320]  The people had more rights and benefits than anybody in Africa and in a lot of parts of
[03:13:52.320 --> 03:13:53.679]  the world.
[03:13:53.679 --> 03:14:01.720]  But then when the Nobel piece of crap prize winner, Barack Obama, hey, Gaddafi has to
[03:14:01.720 --> 03:14:02.720]  go.
[03:14:02.720 --> 03:14:04.920]  Oh, no, only an Italian would say that.
[03:14:04.920 --> 03:14:06.880]  You have to be proper, Solenti.
[03:14:06.880 --> 03:14:12.880]  Folks, folks, he was always folks, folks, folksing us, Gaddafi has to go.
[03:14:12.880 --> 03:14:20.759]  Oh, and Hillary Clinton on CBS News, how did she feel when they found out Gaddafi
[03:14:20.759 --> 03:14:21.759]  was killed?
[03:14:22.199 --> 03:14:26.279]  We came, we saw, he died.
[03:14:26.279 --> 03:14:29.480]  Not making it up, Google it up.
[03:14:29.480 --> 03:14:31.359]  Look what they did to Libya.
[03:14:31.359 --> 03:14:34.119]  Look what they do to one country after another.
[03:14:34.119 --> 03:14:38.240]  All these little clown heads, climate change, climate change, hey, did you get rid of
[03:14:38.240 --> 03:14:40.800]  the PCBs in Hudson River over here yet?
[03:14:40.800 --> 03:14:42.960]  What are you talking about, climate change?
[03:14:42.960 --> 03:14:47.279]  They're killing us in a thousand different ways.
[03:14:47.279 --> 03:14:50.320]  Nobody coming out for peace, hardly anybody.
[03:14:50.320 --> 03:14:52.080]  I launched Occupy Peace.
[03:14:52.080 --> 03:14:55.000]  I do everything I can to push for peace.
[03:14:55.000 --> 03:15:03.800]  I had almost 1500 people here in May, not one piece of coverage, not even a local stupid
[03:15:03.800 --> 03:15:04.800]  newspaper.
[03:15:04.800 --> 03:15:11.000]  But hey, climate change, worried about climate change?
[03:15:11.000 --> 03:15:13.519]  Nuclear war is on the near horizon.
[03:15:13.519 --> 03:15:19.519]  You got the maniacs in charge, hey, I'll tell you what to do.
[03:15:19.519 --> 03:15:24.320]  Democracy, we're bringing freedom and democracy to other countries as we scale it from you.
[03:15:24.320 --> 03:15:32.720]  Yeah, that's America, A-M-E-R-I-K-A, the U-S-S-A, the United Soviet States of America,
[03:15:32.720 --> 03:15:37.720]  and throw fascism in there too, the merger of state and corporate powers.
[03:15:37.720 --> 03:15:44.759]  Again, do everything you can to support Infowars, because Infowars is doing everything
[03:15:44.759 --> 03:15:46.599]  they can to support you.
[03:15:46.679 --> 03:15:50.759]  It's our freak show out there, and the freaks are running the show.
[03:15:50.759 --> 03:15:52.279]  We have to stop it.
[03:16:16.599 --> 03:16:20.880]  And I'm preaching to the choir on that, but a lot of people got plenty of guns, but they
[03:16:20.880 --> 03:16:23.800]  don't have enough storable food or water filtration.
[03:16:23.800 --> 03:16:27.920]  This is something you need now, and we've got it in the food department and in the
[03:16:27.920 --> 03:16:30.000]  high quality water filtration department.
[03:16:30.000 --> 03:16:33.840]  The highest quality food, the best water filtration at the lowest prices you're going

[03:17:03.480 --> 03:17:07.279]  With the supply chain breakdowns and all the problems of the economy, we could not
[03:17:07.279 --> 03:17:13.039]  get the highest quality colloidal silver for almost three years back in stock.
[03:17:13.080 --> 03:17:16.640]  But now we've got it, 30 parts per million from the top lab.
[03:17:16.640 --> 03:17:18.039]  We've got a limited shipment.
[03:17:18.039 --> 03:17:19.759]  Hopefully, we'll have a lot of it in the future.

[03:18:57.199 --> 03:19:03.240]  Omega-3 fatty acids are needed for optimal strength, and they can only be
[03:19:03.240 --> 03:19:05.359]  obtained through diet.
[03:19:05.359 --> 03:19:09.560]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is
[03:19:09.560 --> 03:19:14.320]  trying to ban it, and they can be found in fish, which are arguably the
[03:19:14.320 --> 03:19:17.199]  best source of omega-3s.
[03:19:17.199 --> 03:19:22.039]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[03:19:22.039 --> 03:19:26.679]  Your best option is our ultimate fish oil and ultimate krill oil at

[03:19:29.560 --> 03:19:34.199]  Omega-3 fatty acids are essential for both our neurological and
[03:19:34.199 --> 03:19:38.400]  cardiovascular systems, our brain, and our heart.
[03:19:38.400 --> 03:19:43.199]  They improve mood, mental clarity, and immune function.

[03:19:47.320 --> 03:19:51.359]  available, ultimate fish oil and ultimate krill oil.

[03:19:55.800 --> 03:20:04.599]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:06.000 --> 03:20:34.520]  And now, your host, Gerald Cilente.
[03:20:37.000 --> 03:20:40.000]  I hate raping on the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:40.000 --> 03:20:45.000]  And, as I keep saying, do everything you can to support Infowars.
[03:20:45.000 --> 03:20:49.000]  Journalism is dead. It's finished.
[03:20:49.000 --> 03:20:51.000]  They've killed it.
[03:20:51.000 --> 03:20:55.000]  The bigs have taken over all the companies, they're firing people like crazy.
[03:20:55.000 --> 03:21:01.000]  There's hardly anyone there.
[03:21:01.000 --> 03:21:02.000]  Ready?
[03:21:02.000 --> 03:21:09.000]  After layoff, Gannett is hiring Taylor Swift and Beyonce journalists.
[03:21:09.000 --> 03:21:22.000]  Hey, there's no such thing as calling somebody to follow Taylor Swift and Beyonce a journalist.
[03:21:22.000 --> 03:21:23.000]  All right?
[03:21:23.400 --> 03:21:29.039]  That's not journalism, jerks.
[03:21:29.100 --> 03:21:36.340]  This is reported by the Washington Post.
[03:21:36.340 --> 03:21:40.780]  Months after ordering layoffs that shrank local newsrooms, the country's largest newspaper
[03:21:40.780 --> 03:21:46.260]  chain is hiring journalists to exclusively cover two people, Taylor Swift and Beyonce
[03:21:46.260 --> 03:21:48.940]  Knowles-Cotta.
[03:21:49.100 --> 03:21:54.580]  Gannett Poster II, Want Dads.
[03:21:54.600 --> 03:22:05.440]  One for a multi-hibernate writer, photographer, and social media expert.
[03:22:05.440 --> 03:22:13.200]  You're talking about journalism with, quote, an undeniable thirst for all things Taylor
[03:22:13.200 --> 03:22:22.720]  Swift and another reporter to, quote, tap into stories about Beyonce.
[03:22:22.720 --> 03:22:24.720]  That's journalism?
[03:22:24.720 --> 03:22:27.480]  It shows you how low this country has fallen.
[03:22:27.700 --> 03:22:28.520]  It's a joke. There is no journalism. What Infowars is giving you, and what we're giving you with the Trends Journal, you're not going to find anywhere else. It's gone. And again, when you get
[03:22:47.500 --> 03:22:55.070]  out there and you challenge the system too much,
[03:22:55.100 --> 03:23:05.100]  you get branded, like Russell branded. That's right. Oh, people hate me because they don't
[03:23:05.100 --> 03:23:12.400]  like my language and I'm angry. You have to speak properly when somebody's trying to kill
[03:23:12.400 --> 03:23:18.940]  you. Oh please, oh don't shoot me. I'll be a good boy. Oh please, don't break into
[03:23:18.940 --> 03:23:24.180]  my home as you're robbing me and killing me, trying to.
[03:23:24.400 --> 03:23:32.279]  They're killing us. They're destroying this country in front of our eyes. You bet I'm
[03:23:32.279 --> 03:23:37.480]  angry. As you all know, I quote St. Thomas Aquinas.
[03:23:37.500 --> 03:23:52.750]  He said that it is moral to be angry when there's injustice, and it's immoral not to be angry
[03:23:52.800 --> 03:23:56.800]  when there's injustice.
[03:23:56.500 --> 03:24:03.780]  They call this journalism?
[03:24:03.780 --> 03:24:04.780]  You ready?
[03:24:04.780 --> 03:24:06.420]  It gets even dumber than that.
[03:24:06.600 --> 03:24:15.680]  Carolyn Swift is an artist and businesswoman whose work has tremendous economic, cultural
[03:24:15.680 --> 03:24:17.800]  and societal significance.
[03:24:17.800 --> 03:24:24.480]  Kristin Roberts, Gannett's Chief Content Officer said in a statement, she is shaping a generation
[03:24:24.480 --> 03:24:29.280]  and is relevant, influential and innovative.
[03:24:29.280 --> 03:24:37.920]  She called Beyonce, a force in the world of business, music, fashion and our culture.
[03:24:37.920 --> 03:24:43.240]  Our role is to cover the newsmakers, who run the world.
[03:24:43.500 --> 03:24:53.220]  Influence our society, impact our lives, and create positive change.
[03:24:53.220 --> 03:24:56.780]  You think this is positive change?
[03:24:56.780 --> 03:24:59.060]  What are you talking about?
[03:24:59.060 --> 03:24:59.940]  What are you talking about?
[03:25:00.200 --> 03:25:05.200]  I put on a concert.
[03:25:05.400 --> 03:25:10.000]  It's 1977 to 1978, I forgot.
[03:25:10.200 --> 03:25:14.660]  With Ella Fitzgerald.
[03:25:14.700 --> 03:25:16.700]  Thank you.
[03:25:16.800 --> 03:25:26.519]  At the Atlanta Convention Center, and when we went backstage, she said that my former
[03:25:26.519 --> 03:25:30.640]  wife reminded her of her goddaughter Carmen.
[03:25:30.640 --> 03:25:38.199]  This is Ella Fitzgerald, not this show, nothings.
[03:25:38.199 --> 03:25:45.560]  I put on a concert, the Superdome, with Dionne Warwick, after we had the trade show.
[03:25:45.560 --> 03:25:47.960]  She was the number two guy running a major trade association.
[03:25:48.100 --> 03:25:54.140]  After the trade show, we put on a dinner and an event for the people that...
[03:25:54.300 --> 03:25:57.939]  participate in the trade show.
[03:25:58.000 --> 03:26:05.520]  This is what America's sunk down to.
[03:26:05.520 --> 03:26:12.900]  Going back to Biden, CBS poll that just came out, only 34% of voters think Biden would
[03:26:12.900 --> 03:26:15.200]  complete second term.
[03:26:15.200 --> 03:26:19.820]  The guy can't complete the first term, what are you talking about?
[03:26:19.820 --> 03:26:23.280]  So here's my forecast, Biden's not going to run.
[03:26:23.280 --> 03:26:31.100]  Biden will not run in the 2024 presidential reality show, and it won't be Kamala Harris,
[03:26:31.100 --> 03:26:33.460]  she won't win either.
[03:26:33.460 --> 03:26:38.500]  Maybe that got some Gavin Newsom over there, the arrogant, my daddy works for the Getty
[03:26:38.500 --> 03:26:43.880]  family who was a lawyer, and I'm a daddy's lawyer, and I went up to the French Laundry
[03:26:43.880 --> 03:26:49.900]  and had dinner while I told everybody to lock down Gavin Newsom.
[03:26:49.900 --> 03:26:57.340]  My forecast is Biden's not going to run, he's done, and they know it.
[03:26:57.340 --> 03:27:00.980]  And the polls that come out and say that Trump would beat Biden, you got to look at the
[03:27:00.980 --> 03:27:03.340]  other polls, people don't want either of them.
[03:27:03.500 --> 03:27:11.500]  And I believe if RFK Jr. runs on a libertarian ticket, he has a shot.
[03:27:11.800 --> 03:27:16.800]  The people are tired of the crime syndicate.
[03:27:16.800 --> 03:27:17.800]  You look at the data.
[03:27:17.800 --> 03:27:21.720]  You look at the data, they have no faith in Congress.
[03:27:21.720 --> 03:27:25.439]  They rank Congress near used car salesmen.
[03:27:25.439 --> 03:27:27.199]  That's being sexist.
[03:27:27.199 --> 03:27:32.039]  Used car salespeople can't say salesmen.
[03:27:32.039 --> 03:27:37.199]  The only men are lousy used car dealers, sellers.
[03:27:37.199 --> 03:27:38.840]  Let's stay stupid.
[03:27:39.840 --> 03:27:43.720]  And when we come back, we're going to talk about the economy.
[03:27:43.720 --> 03:27:46.679]  This just came out on CNBC.
[03:27:46.679 --> 03:27:54.619]  Americans plan to keep cutting back on spending throughout the holidays, new survey shows.
[03:27:54.619 --> 03:27:58.300]  How long ago did we warn about this in the Trends Journal?
[03:27:58.300 --> 03:28:02.039]  We said the economy is going to look good during the summer because it's summertime
[03:28:02.039 --> 03:28:04.880]  and the living is easy.
[03:28:04.920 --> 03:28:10.880]  You spread your wings and you make to the sky, summertime, summertime, summertime, summertime.
[03:28:10.880 --> 03:28:12.599]  Oh, there's no those happy songs anymore.
[03:28:12.599 --> 03:28:14.920]  No, we got Beyonce and I forgot.
[03:28:14.920 --> 03:28:19.000]  Anyway, the summer state of mind is over now.
[03:28:19.000 --> 03:28:20.640]  Reality is setting in.
[03:28:20.640 --> 03:28:22.920]  Oh, gas prices, Brent crude.
[03:28:22.920 --> 03:28:25.560]  Oh, it's only at $94 a barrel.
[03:28:25.560 --> 03:28:26.960]  Don't worry about it.
[03:28:26.960 --> 03:28:27.960]  Don't worry about it.
[03:28:27.960 --> 03:28:29.359]  We're worried about core inflation.
[03:28:29.400 --> 03:28:39.119]  This is real. It's going to get worse. You better prepare and prevail to prosper. We're
[03:28:39.119 --> 03:28:44.480]  going to go through a system of economic decline globally like we've never seen before. Oh,
[03:28:44.480 --> 03:28:50.380]  the ECB raised interest rates last week. What will that what does that mean? Yeah, a lot
[03:28:50.380 --> 03:28:59.900]  more is coming up. Stay tuned. A lot of listeners have complained in the last two years that

[03:33:25.000 --> 03:33:33.000]  Hey, great being on the Alex Jones Show. Can't do what you can to support them.
[03:33:33.000 --> 03:33:40.000]  Because Infowars is doing everything they can to support you. And you can see what's happening one after another.
[03:33:40.000 --> 03:33:51.000]  Once you start getting out there and giving an alternative to the lies and loss of freedom, they go after you.
[03:33:51.000 --> 03:34:01.000]  No question about it. You don't want to take that COVID jab? Well, then you believe in misinformation, which I find sexist calling it misinformation.
[03:34:01.000 --> 03:34:12.000]  Let's call it gender information. Anyway, so do what you can. You know, as I said, I got Infowars every day.
[03:34:12.000 --> 03:34:18.000]  I want to see what they're reporting on. And one of the articles they have up is about the homeless problem.
[03:34:18.000 --> 03:34:29.000]  They're spending like all this money, millions and millions of dollars to build these tent things, you know, in cities.
[03:34:29.000 --> 03:34:31.000]  You got to check out the article there.
[03:34:31.200 --> 03:34:35.200]  And...
[03:34:35.200 --> 03:34:45.200]  This year, one of our top trends for 2023 is the homeless solution.
[03:34:45.100 --> 03:34:48.960]  But it's being totally ignored.
[03:34:48.960 --> 03:34:49.960]  There you go.
[03:34:49.960 --> 03:34:57.900]  Los Angeles spends $44,000 per temporary tent for Homeless Village, $44,000.
[03:34:57.900 --> 03:34:59.640]  This is only the beginning.
[03:34:59.640 --> 03:35:05.080]  All the money that they put putting people in, quote, shelters, and these, quote, shelters
[03:35:05.080 --> 03:35:08.820]  are nothing more than deals they make with people that give a lot of money to politicians
[03:35:08.820 --> 03:35:13.320]  in cities to put them in these places and charge ridiculous prices.
[03:35:13.540 --> 03:35:18.180]  So there's our top trend, the homeless solution.
[03:35:18.180 --> 03:35:19.440]  So here's the homeless solution.
[03:35:19.500 --> 03:35:27.460]  I'm up here in Kingston, New York, the foothills of the Catskill Mountains.
[03:35:27.460 --> 03:35:32.940]  Once upon a time, this used to be called this area, a little northwest of here, the Borscht
[03:35:32.940 --> 03:35:39.260]  Belt, because the people used to come up from New York City, a lot of the Jewish people,
[03:35:39.260 --> 03:35:46.620]  and they had Grossinger's up here, they had Brown, they had all these great resorts
[03:35:46.620 --> 03:35:53.380]  where the top, top comedians and entertainers used to play.
[03:35:53.380 --> 03:36:04.660]  And then what happened was the jets set, and this is like, starts happening in the mid-1960s.
[03:36:04.660 --> 03:36:08.420]  So by the 80s, these places went out.
[03:36:08.420 --> 03:36:12.300]  Come on down, Eastern Airlines, come on down, you know, you take a trip to Florida, people
[03:36:12.300 --> 03:36:13.300]  flying jets.
[03:36:13.300 --> 03:36:17.420]  They're not coming up to the countries anymore.
[03:36:17.420 --> 03:36:26.020]  This beautiful, beautiful land, turn these into homeless, it was Boys Town, when they
[03:36:26.020 --> 03:36:31.900]  took these kids and put them in Boys Town, like that old movie used to talk about.
[03:36:31.900 --> 03:36:34.300]  Let's create homeless towns.
[03:36:34.300 --> 03:36:36.220]  Get the people out of the cities.
[03:36:36.300 --> 03:37:04.560]  By this time, as it keeps getting worse, it's going to be trillions of dollars throughout the United States taking care of the homeless. Get them out of the cities. You want to go to San Francisco? You want to have a lousy time? L.A., one place after another, New York? Get them out of the cities.
[03:37:04.600 --> 03:37:09.600]  And put them in, let's create homeless towns.
[03:37:09.700 --> 03:37:23.940]  Teach them how to do skills, whether it's woodworking, how to paint, how to cook, in
[03:37:23.940 --> 03:37:30.100]  the warm weather months, farming, growing their own food.
[03:37:30.100 --> 03:37:35.740]  Creating these beautiful homeless towns, and you can do it all over America, because once
[03:37:35.740 --> 03:37:39.380]  you get out of the cities and once you get out of the suburbs, you've got a lot of empty
[03:37:39.380 --> 03:37:42.120]  land everywhere.
[03:37:42.120 --> 03:37:46.860]  To take over these buildings all over the place, and do it in Kingston too, and put
[03:37:46.860 --> 03:37:52.100]  in homeless people, and then walk in the streets all over the place, peeing poop and
[03:37:52.100 --> 03:37:55.420]  throwing garbage, doing crazy stuff out of their mind, get them out of here.
[03:37:55.600 --> 03:38:07.380]  Build homeless towns. And the other article up on InfoWars is about Federmann.
[03:38:07.400 --> 03:38:15.000]  The guy, the stroke guy, out of his mind.
[03:38:15.200 --> 03:38:20.000]  That's the senator from Pennsylvania.
[03:38:20.100 --> 03:38:30.100]  And now, the article on Infowars about how they changed the dress code.
[03:38:31.700 --> 03:38:39.060]  Senate ends dress code so Fetterman could dress like a slob.
[03:38:39.060 --> 03:38:41.780]  Look how disgusting this looks.
[03:38:41.780 --> 03:38:44.420]  It's the slobbing down of America.
[03:38:44.420 --> 03:38:48.760]  This country is going down in front of our eyes.
[03:38:48.760 --> 03:38:52.820]  This was not the United States that I grew up in.
[03:38:52.820 --> 03:38:54.940]  This was not the United States.
[03:38:55.000 --> 03:39:01.880]  That the immigrants all over the world wanted to come to.
[03:39:01.880 --> 03:39:06.440]  Like my parents' generation, may their soul rest in peace.
[03:39:06.500 --> 03:39:15.020]  This picture of my parents' wedding, 1934.
[03:39:15.100 --> 03:39:19.260]  See it?
[03:39:19.300 --> 03:39:26.279]  You get that picture?
[03:39:26.279 --> 03:39:28.279]  Look at them.
[03:39:28.279 --> 03:39:29.720]  Look at them.
[03:39:29.720 --> 03:39:32.980]  Look at the dignity and grace.
[03:39:32.980 --> 03:39:36.220]  My father worked in a fish store.
[03:39:36.220 --> 03:39:38.939]  My mother was a secretary.
[03:39:38.939 --> 03:39:47.340]  My aunt Zizi right next to her, she used to package things in a warehouse.
[03:39:47.340 --> 03:39:50.420]  No construction workers.
[03:39:50.420 --> 03:39:57.740]  This was America, 1934, at the height of the Great Depression.
[03:39:57.900 --> 03:40:12.539]  And look how low it's gone, and you listen to the music back then, upbeat and lifting.
[03:40:12.539 --> 03:40:18.039]  Grab your coat and take a hat, leave your worries by the doorstep.
[03:40:18.039 --> 03:40:23.619]  Life could be so sweet on the sunny side of the street.
[03:40:23.619 --> 03:40:32.880]  I used to walk in the shade with the blues on parade, but not anymore, happier than Rockefeller.
[03:40:32.880 --> 03:40:40.520]  That was America, and it's gone from this to dressing like a slob.
[03:40:40.520 --> 03:40:46.600]  But Theterman or Chuck Schumer, it was the guy, you could dress like that, according
[03:40:46.600 --> 03:40:48.600]  to that article.
[03:40:48.600 --> 03:40:54.539]  He exemplifies how low America has fallen.
[03:40:54.539 --> 03:40:59.640]  That's our Senate, a Senate of slobs.
[03:40:59.640 --> 03:41:04.160]  This is the fall of the Roman Empire right in front of our eyes.
[03:41:04.160 --> 03:41:11.640]  When you watch those movies, you read the books about how deranged everybody became.
[03:41:11.640 --> 03:41:15.240]  And why did the Roman Empire go down?
[03:41:15.240 --> 03:41:17.800]  Same reason one after another goes down.
[03:41:17.800 --> 03:41:18.800]  They didn't have enough.
[03:41:18.800 --> 03:41:20.720]  They kept starting wars.
[03:41:20.720 --> 03:41:23.359]  The world got to do what we want them to do.
[03:41:23.359 --> 03:41:26.359]  We're in charge.
[03:41:26.359 --> 03:41:26.600]  Yeah.
[03:41:26.700 --> 03:41:34.020]  Again, united we stand, divided we die.
[03:41:34.020 --> 03:41:35.820]  We must unite.
[03:41:35.820 --> 03:41:41.140]  The 2024 elections may be our last chance.
[03:41:41.140 --> 03:41:47.500]  That's if they don't annihilate us with a nuclear war before then, because as I say,
[03:41:47.500 --> 03:41:51.020]  when all else fails, they take you to war.
[03:41:51.020 --> 03:41:56.320]  Could you imagine that comedian who used to play the piano with his penis, who became
[03:41:56.360 --> 03:42:03.200]  the president of Ukraine, is now coming back to the United States?
[03:42:03.200 --> 03:42:09.080]  Are you spending all that money for homeless people, 61% of the people living paycheck to
[03:42:09.080 --> 03:42:14.520]  paycheck and over $130 billion of our money going over there?
[03:42:14.520 --> 03:42:16.400]  For what?
[03:42:16.400 --> 03:42:19.040]  To keep bloodying the killing fields?
[03:42:19.040 --> 03:42:20.040]  No.
[03:42:20.040 --> 03:42:24.400]  To enrich the military industrial complex, like Dwight D. Eisenhower, five-star general,
[03:42:24.400 --> 03:42:29.360]  Supreme Commander of the Allied Forces, and two-term president warned us about.
[03:42:29.360 --> 03:42:34.040]  That the military industrial complex is robbing the nation of the genius of scientists, the
[03:42:34.040 --> 03:42:37.480]  sweat of the laborers, and the future of the children.
[03:42:37.480 --> 03:42:39.400]  So unite with info wars.
[03:42:39.400 --> 03:42:45.440]  And of course, if you want to read history before it happens, you want the Trends Journal.
[03:42:45.440 --> 03:42:51.760]  And you go to jonestrends.com, jonestrends.com, and you get a real break on it.
[03:42:51.760 --> 03:42:53.040]  Of course, you're almost nothing.
[03:42:53.040 --> 03:42:54.040]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:54.040 --> 03:42:58.480]  I didn't realize this was back this week.
[03:42:58.480 --> 03:42:59.480]  Thought it was next week.
[03:42:59.480 --> 03:43:00.480]  I come in this morning.
[03:43:00.480 --> 03:43:03.960]  It's back in the warehouse, ready to roll.
[03:43:03.960 --> 03:43:07.840]  Body's ultimate memory formula, and the first thing I did was pop one of these bad
[03:43:07.840 --> 03:43:08.840]  boys.
[03:43:08.840 --> 03:43:11.840]  Overhead shot, please.
[03:43:11.840 --> 03:43:16.080]  Look how full this bottle is.
[03:43:16.080 --> 03:43:19.080]  Right to the top, folks.
[03:43:19.080 --> 03:43:23.960]  Right to the top with these 95% of humanoids.
[03:43:23.960 --> 03:43:27.640]  Again, most turmeric formulas are 5%.
[03:43:27.640 --> 03:43:28.920]  Some are maybe 10.
[03:43:28.920 --> 03:43:31.680]  The other strongest brands are 75%.
[03:43:31.680 --> 03:43:35.760]  This is 95%.
[03:43:35.760 --> 03:43:36.760]  Super constant.
[03:43:36.760 --> 03:43:37.760]  It's like taking one pill.
[03:43:37.760 --> 03:43:40.400]  It's like taking 10 of the average pill.
[03:43:40.400 --> 03:43:41.400]  It's that powerful.
[03:43:41.400 --> 03:43:42.400]  Or more.
[03:43:42.400 --> 03:44:02.040]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[03:44:02.040 --> 03:44:06.520]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all
[03:44:06.520 --> 03:44:11.560]  the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[03:44:11.560 --> 03:44:16.240]  That's why Infowars Life created the powerful vitamin mineral fusion formula.
[03:44:16.240 --> 03:44:21.320]  The new platinum standard of advanced multivitamin formulation, vitamin mineral fusion uses
[03:44:21.320 --> 03:44:26.040]  a unique delivery system to maximize the effects and give your body the tools it needs

[03:45:10.280 --> 03:45:11.280]  a day.
[03:45:11.280 --> 03:45:15.360]  Hundreds of peer-reviewed scientific articles are published every year on the chemistry
[03:45:15.360 --> 03:45:19.440]  and therapeutic potential of turmeric and its active components.
[03:45:19.440 --> 03:45:24.200]  Bodies will reduce inflammation throughout the body, help boost and support flexibility,
[03:45:24.200 --> 03:45:29.280]  increase mobility, assist in joint function, bolster your immune system, and so much
[03:45:29.280 --> 03:45:30.280]  more.
[03:45:30.280 --> 03:45:35.360]  Regular turmeric from the store contains about 1-5% of the active ingredient curcuminoids,
[03:45:35.360 --> 03:45:41.040]  and our super powerful extract used in bodies contains over 95% of the active ingredients
[03:45:41.040 --> 03:45:42.040]  in turmeric.

[03:46:03.840 --> 03:46:04.840]  through diet.
[03:46:05.320 --> 03:46:10.360]  They can be found in grass-fed beef, which is why the ruling class is trying to ban
[03:46:10.360 --> 03:46:11.360]  it.
[03:46:11.360 --> 03:46:16.440]  And they can be found in fish, which are arguably the best source of Omega 3s.
[03:46:16.440 --> 03:46:22.000]  But the problem today is finding fish without a high mercury content.
[03:46:22.000 --> 03:46:29.440]  Your best option is our ultimate fish oil and ultimate krill oil at InfowarsStore.com.

[03:48:47.360 --> 03:48:55.240]  Life Trifecta pack. Now, right. Now we're going to go on to what in the world is going
[03:48:55.240 --> 03:49:01.540]  on in the economy. There's an article that came out this past Friday in the Wall Street
[03:49:01.540 --> 03:49:08.160]  Journal store workers face more danger. Retailers say organized theft and violent incidents
[03:49:08.160 --> 03:49:14.760]  are on the rise. Target chief executive Brian Cornell said last month that the retailer
[03:49:14.760 --> 03:49:23.320]  recorded 120% increase in theft incidents involving violence or threats of violence during
[03:49:23.320 --> 03:49:31.320]  the first five months of the year. I'm noting this because none of this happened before
[03:49:31.320 --> 03:49:37.800]  they launched the COVID war. And as I noted to you, everyone listening and everyone that
[03:49:37.800 --> 03:49:44.320]  subscribes to the Trans Journal knows it, the politicians called it a war. That's right.
[03:49:44.320 --> 03:49:49.000]  From Trump on down, they called it a war. We're fighting a war. We're fighting a war.
[03:49:49.000 --> 03:49:53.720]  Globally, they did this. So when they say they're fighting a war, they're spreading
[03:49:53.720 --> 03:49:58.640]  fear and hysteria and people march off to war, just like over 80% marched off to the
[03:49:58.640 --> 03:50:04.480]  Afghan war and believe the crap spewing out of the mouth of a little ignorant nobody
[03:50:04.480 --> 03:50:10.560]  of a clown boy with a pair of cajones, small and a mothball, and about that thick the
[03:50:10.560 --> 03:50:19.280]  rest of it. George W. Bush. My daddy was George H. W. Bush and my granddaddy was
[03:50:19.280 --> 03:50:24.320]  Prescott Bush and I'm a member of the club. They swallowed that crap. They swallowed
[03:50:24.320 --> 03:50:30.440]  the COVID war crap. The world has changed dramatically since the COVID war. This was
[03:50:30.440 --> 03:50:36.040]  not going on like this before. The homeless situation you have wasn't this bad before.
[03:50:37.080 --> 03:50:42.040]  The crime rates weren't like this. All the cars that are being stolen,
[03:50:42.040 --> 03:50:48.360]  this wasn't going on before then. The COVID war did it. Now, I mentioned that
[03:50:49.160 --> 03:50:55.640]  we're going to watch the economy go down because what you have to look at are the numbers
[03:50:55.640 --> 03:51:05.480]  in the manufacturing index. As the economy was going up, they said the economy was going up in
[03:51:05.480 --> 03:51:15.000]  the last several weeks, last quarter, because as we said, people are traveling more. It's
[03:51:15.000 --> 03:51:20.120]  summertime. They're spending more money on services. They're not sending them on products
[03:51:20.120 --> 03:51:28.040]  because your manufacturing rates in Europe, in Germany, in China, get below 50%.
[03:51:30.600 --> 03:51:36.760]  Anything below 50% is contraction. People aren't buying anything. They're not buying. They're
[03:51:36.760 --> 03:51:42.120]  buying a lot less because they can't afford it because of inflation. As I mentioned, gasoline
[03:51:42.120 --> 03:51:50.040]  prices now, breadcrude. Here in Kingston, in this area, in Dutchess County,
[03:51:51.480 --> 03:51:54.120]  regular gas is sold for $4 a gallon.
[03:51:54.300 --> 03:52:05.539]  So, what we're talking about is that people can't afford to buy things.
[03:52:05.539 --> 03:52:08.660]  When they show, like for example, they'll say that retail sales went up.
[03:52:08.660 --> 03:52:09.660]  No, they didn't.
[03:52:09.660 --> 03:52:12.939]  Not when you put inflation into it, they down.
[03:52:12.939 --> 03:52:19.340]  So now, with the holiday season coming, you're going to start seeing a big decline.
[03:52:19.340 --> 03:52:22.660]  And we're saying this because we want you to prepare for the worst.
[03:52:22.660 --> 03:52:23.660]  All prices.
[03:52:23.660 --> 03:52:25.779]  My goal's like at $19.22 is around here.
[03:52:26.300 --> 03:52:37.460]  Gold prices are only going to go up when interest rates go down, and the guess on the street
[03:52:37.460 --> 03:52:40.820]  is they're going to raise them one more time in America.
[03:52:40.820 --> 03:52:45.500]  Probably not on Wednesday when the Fed meets again, but they just raised them again over
[03:52:45.500 --> 03:52:50.740]  there in Europe, and this is going to bring the European economy down.
[03:52:50.740 --> 03:52:52.320]  Germany is already in a recession.
[03:52:52.320 --> 03:52:54.679]  It's the fourth largest economy in the world.
[03:52:54.800 --> 03:53:03.359]  And their manufacturing index is negative.
[03:53:03.359 --> 03:53:06.900]  And now with the higher interest rates, a bad situation is going to get worse and now
[03:53:06.900 --> 03:53:09.980]  the travel season is over in Europe.
[03:53:09.980 --> 03:53:24.679]  But going back to spending less, US retailers will hire the lowest number of seasonal workers
[03:53:24.679 --> 03:53:29.320]  for this holiday season since, take a guess.
[03:53:29.400 --> 03:53:36.400]  2008. The Panic of 08. I took that domain name out in 2007.
[03:53:39.900 --> 03:53:59.070]  According to a report by Challenger Gray and Christmas, provided exclusively to Reuters, retailers are expected to add just 410,000 seasonal jobs this season.
[03:53:59.100 --> 03:54:10.560]  To an analysis of non-seasonally adjusted data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics by
[03:54:10.560 --> 03:54:21.400]  the Global Outplays, that is just slightly above the 324,900 workers they added in the
[03:54:21.400 --> 03:54:23.600]  last quarter of 2008.
[03:54:23.600 --> 03:54:34.880]  Now, again, 410,000 new seasonal jobs now, about 325,000 back in 2008.
[03:54:34.880 --> 03:54:42.640]  Look how much the population has grown since then, and look how much inflation has gone
[03:54:42.640 --> 03:54:43.920]  up since then.
[03:54:44.000 --> 03:54:55.000]  US retailers added 519,400 jobs in the last quarter of 2022.
[03:54:55.300 --> 03:55:19.490]  Remember, 2022. A 26% decline from the same period 2021. And now it's going to get worse than that. The COVID war has destroyed the lives and livelihoods of billions of people across the planet.
[03:55:19.500 --> 03:55:29.180]  We have never gone in, we have never gone this far into September and not had big hiring
[03:55:29.180 --> 03:55:34.620]  predictions from retailers, said Andrew Challenger, senior vice president of Challenger Grand Christmas.
[03:55:34.700 --> 03:55:41.860]  Are you ready?
[03:55:41.860 --> 03:55:51.220]  U.S.-based companies have so far announced just 8,000 planned hires for the holiday season
[03:55:51.220 --> 03:56:03.180]  compared with 258,201 planned hires announced by employers by this point in 2022, again
[03:56:03.180 --> 03:56:07.940]  according to Challenger Grand Christmas tracking.
[03:56:07.940 --> 03:56:17.100]  It's hurting people everywhere, inflation, driving up consumer credit card debt by billions
[03:56:17.100 --> 03:56:18.100]  of dollars.
[03:56:18.200 --> 03:56:25.920]  Drivers are skipping car insurance after premiums increase.
[03:56:25.920 --> 03:56:31.320]  Very important, money funds attract one trillion dollars.
[03:56:31.400 --> 03:56:37.480]  In funds so far in 2023, you know why?
[03:56:37.480 --> 03:56:40.760]  Because interest rates are going up, it's going to go up, why the markets are going
[03:56:40.760 --> 03:56:42.720]  to go down.
[03:56:42.720 --> 03:56:48.279]  You buy money market funds, treasuries, and you're getting like 5% on your money.
[03:56:48.279 --> 03:56:49.199]  Why are you going to gamble?
[03:56:49.300 --> 03:56:57.980]  This, and a lot, lot, lot, lot more, last week's Trends Journal is over 180 pages.
[03:56:57.980 --> 03:57:02.980]  You read what you want, and you can listen to it too.
[03:57:02.980 --> 03:57:10.900]  We cover the world like nobody else, and you go to jonestrends.com, and you're getting
[03:57:10.900 --> 03:57:13.500]  it for almost nothing.
[03:57:13.500 --> 03:57:20.539]  We're giving you, like Infowars does, everything we can to help you.
[03:57:20.539 --> 03:57:21.980]  You know why?
[03:57:21.980 --> 03:57:26.779]  Because we are American patriots.
[03:57:26.779 --> 03:57:31.019]  We abide by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.
[03:57:31.019 --> 03:57:35.179]  I'm only me because I'm a Napolitano born in the Bronx, born to be free.
[03:57:35.179 --> 03:57:39.340]  If I was born in Atadilla, Pina Vica, Cuenca, it wouldn't be me.
[03:57:39.340 --> 03:57:42.939]  And that's why we're giving you everything we can, as Infowars is.
[03:57:42.939 --> 03:57:44.300]  So you give all you can.
[03:57:44.300 --> 03:57:44.660]  Thank you.
[03:57:44.800 --> 03:57:52.660]  Let me remind you folks to go to infowarsstore.com to keep us on the air and in the fight.
[03:57:52.660 --> 03:57:57.160]  We really do make it easy for you to support us by having really incredible products.
[03:57:57.160 --> 03:58:02.359]  One of the most incredible I have to say is DNA Force Plus, and it's one of these supplements
[03:58:02.359 --> 03:58:06.500]  that you really don't know what the effect it's going to have on you is until you try
[03:58:06.500 --> 03:58:07.500]  it.
[03:58:07.500 --> 03:58:09.340]  And it's different for everybody, but it's always positive.
[03:58:09.340 --> 03:58:12.720]  Essentially it just, it helps in a variety of different ways and whatever way that your
[03:58:12.720 --> 03:58:14.279]  body needs, it'll help in that way.
[03:58:14.279 --> 03:58:18.199]  DNA Force Plus is the perfect formula to help you support optimal energy levels while adapting
[03:58:18.199 --> 03:58:20.840]  your body to handle the daily bombardment of toxins.
[03:58:20.840 --> 03:58:25.400]  That's why DNA Force Plus has exactly what you need to provide yourselves with protection.
[03:58:25.400 --> 03:58:28.279]  By taking something like DNA Force Plus, you're just upping the game on all of your

[03:58:35.640 --> 03:58:41.039]  fight and fighting back against the mental, spiritual and physical poisoning that we contend
[03:58:41.039 --> 03:58:47.119]  with on a daily basis.

[03:58:52.800 --> 03:58:55.679]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists and the fact that
[03:58:55.679 --> 03:59:00.759]  we're not caught flat footed during their major takeover is because of you.
[03:59:00.759 --> 03:59:02.640]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
