[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:11.000]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the InfoWars and say, I don't know what's
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000]  going to happen at the end of this, but you want to fight?
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000]  You better believe you've got one!
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:33.000]  Atrazine, by the way, if you in a lab put Atrazine in a tank full of frogs, it will
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000]  chemically castrate and forcibly feminize every frog in there.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000]  Every time I bring up a f***ing subject, you know all about it!
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.000]  Yeah, of course.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000]  What is it?
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]  You know, I'm not going to get into it.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]  The point is, is that they took male frogs, gave them Atrazine.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000]  God f***ing damn it, I'm getting pissed now!
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000]  And 10% of the frogs, the male frogs, will turn into fully viable females.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000]  I don't like them putting chemicals in the water that turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000]  Do you understand that?
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]  Turn the friggin' frogs gay!
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]  Serious crap!
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000]  You said the chemicals in the water, which are put there by the government, are turning
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]  frogs gay in a gay bomb.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000]  There are more than a thousand university studies from England, to Australia, to South
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000]  Africa, to Mexico, to Austin, Texas, that Atrazine is literally making male frogs gay.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]  They don't want to have sex with female frogs, and their populations are plummeting and even
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.000]  becoming extinct.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000]  Boom!
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]  This is the most common contaminant in ground and surface water and drinking water, and
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]  the level of Atrazine that it took to make this male turn into a female is three times
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000]  less than what's allowed in our drinking water.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000]  I think you are full of conspiracies, and I don't think that you are helping our country.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]  Did you know the media misrepresents what I actually say?
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000]  Like, give me an example of one of my conspiracies.
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000]  Uh, that...
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000]  Come on, come on in.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000]  That water's making the frogs gay.
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]  When I talked about chemicals in the water turning the frogs gay, the media only took
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.000]  a short clip out of a 30-plus minute report where I laid out university studies and documents
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000]  from South Africa, the US, Europe, you name it, that Atrazine alone in the water was
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]  making the frogs hermaphroditic, and that this same chemical is bombarding us.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]  Boom!
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]  Boom!
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.000]  Serious crap!
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.000]  Atrazine is what helps us become sterile and die.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:31.000]  It's liberal, and don't be racist against Atrazine, as any gay frog.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.000]  They took male frogs, gave them Atrazine, 10% of them turned into female and produced
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:45.000]  fertile eggs, and we're subjecting our children to exposure to that every day.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]  What is Atrazine?
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]  It's in the water.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000]  It's a pesticide.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]  Frogs aren't gay.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000]  Atrazine's good.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]  There's not a chemical program to reduce fertility.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]  InfoWars is sorry.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]  Please let us back on Twitter.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]  I'm sick.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000]  Just let me sick.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]  I suspect even now, orders are being shelved into telephones, and men with guns will soon
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]  be on their way.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]  It's Chancellor Sutler.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]  Damn it!
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.000]  Because while the truncheon may be used in lieu of conversation, words will always retain
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]  their power.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.000]  Words are for the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]  the truth.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]  You decided, sir.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]  You wanted it foolproof.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]  You taught me every television in London.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:41.000]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression, and where once you had the freedom to object,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000]  to think and speak as you saw fit, you now have sensors and systems of surveillance coercing
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]  your conformity and selecting your submission.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]  Cameras.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]  We need cameras.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]  How did this happen?
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]  Who's to blame?
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]  They will be held accountable.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]  But again, truth be told, if you're looking for the guilty, you need only look into a
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]  mirror.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000]  I know why you did it.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.000]  I know you were afraid.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]  Who wouldn't be?
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]  War?
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]  Terror?
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]  Disease?
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:18.000]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]  common sense.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic, you turned to the now High Chancellor, Adam
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]  Sutler.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]  He promised you order, he promised you peace, and all he demanded in return was your silent,
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]  obedient consent.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:40.000]  There is a war.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]  It's happening now.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000]  The time to choose sides has come.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]  We are the resistance.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]  We are the Infowar.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]  We are the Infowar.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:23.000]  no hangover.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]  It is a game changer.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]  Nobody's got something close to this.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:29.000]  Then our Brain Force Plus is a good, basic, clean nootropic.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.000]  It gives you four to six hours of amazing energy, again, with no hangover, no jitters.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:40.000]  Both products back in stock, InfowarStore.com for 50% off, and it funds the Infowar.
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:45.000]  So get your Brain Force Ultra, your Brain Force Plus, and your Turbo Force all exclusively
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]  at InfowarStore.com, and know you're funding the second American Revolution 1770.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.000]  1776 worldwide.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:58.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776, and the answer for energy is Brain Force.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:32.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for joining us on this live June 22nd, 2023, Thursday
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]  transmission.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:40.000]  I am loaded for bear today, coming to you from the amazing International Christian Command
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.000]  Base that Pastor Rodney Howard Brown has built here in Florida over the last several decades
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]  with his incredible crew.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]  This place is a beehive of resistance.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.000]  Just missionaries going out all over the world, young people everywhere, huge prayer meetings
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:58.000]  going on live on TV right now.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]  Next to me, we're being sent out on their satellites all over the world.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]  It's incredible.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]  Just absolutely amazing what they're doing.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]  The force is definitely with them, and not the force of George Lucas, but the force of
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]  the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:18.000]  We have huge breaking news that I'm going to hit that's massive, that's massive, massive.
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.000]  And I can give you the whole backstory on this.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:26.000]  I can give you more than even the Washington Post 20-page report admits to.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.000]  A plot against the president, a plot against America, a coup plan, a plot to put me in jail,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]  a plot to put Roger Stone in jail.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]  It's all in the report.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]  It ties into Durham, and it ties into Jack Smith.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]  It ties into it all.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]  And I just learned of this this morning.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]  I just learned of this this morning with a frantic call.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]  By frantic, Roger Stone never calls me two or three times in a row, and then sends me
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]  call me three exclamation marks.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:00.000]  So I just learned of this about an hour and a half ago, and as speedily as I could read
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:03.000]  the 20-page article that's behind a paywall at the Washington Post.
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:08.000]  But it's what's buried in this that is insane.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]  And this is senior Justice Department officials admitting this.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.000]  And again, when you know what you're reading, it's even more insane.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]  Because it admits that all these other federal agencies that aren't even law enforcement
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000]  agencies were conducting criminal investigations of Trump, myself, and Roger Stone.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:25.000]  You cannot make this up.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]  You cannot make this up.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.000]  And that's just buried in there.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]  Well, the National Archives and all these other groups demanded they did the investigation,
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000]  and the airlines blocked them from flying, and everyone was working together, and the
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000]  FBI just wouldn't indict President Trump and Alex Jones and Roger Stone.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]  That's all coming up.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.000]  Meanwhile, where's Owen Schroer?
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]  I would have him on today to co-host with me.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]  Plus, he's in this story.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]  He's been indicted for January 6th for, quote, attacking and entering the Capitol.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]  It says that in the indictment.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]  He never entered the Capitol.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]  He was there with me trying to stop people going in.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]  We have the video.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]  Oh, but where is he today?
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:10.000]  Oh, he's on an airplane flying into Mordor on the Potomac, Washington, D.C., where he's
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.000]  going to be in court tomorrow.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]  And they've got rigged juries in D.C.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:21.000]  They could send a choir boy to the death chamber, you know, to the firing squad.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]  It's, oh, Owen Schroer admits he's guilty.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:31.000]  Yeah, in a plea deal to not face years in prison rigged.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:38.000]  And so they're saying he'll just get probation, that evil criminal that has no criminal record,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:42.000]  that was a successful sportscaster when he was like 18 years old, 19, and that was a
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]  youth camp Christian leader at his church helping disabled children.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]  But the guy's literally Clark Kent.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:51.000]  And this is what happens to him.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.000]  He's worked for us seven years.
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:57.000]  Oh, but don't worry, Clark Kent, they want to put him in prison.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]  So they said, oh, we'll give you a plea deal, which I'm not supposed to get into the details
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]  of, you'll see what happens in court tomorrow.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]  And they may go back on it.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]  They may go ahead and just try him and throw his ass in prison.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:10.000]  Excuse me for my French, Lord, I'm getting upset about my friends about to be.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:13.000]  So you get what's happening here, OK?
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:16.000]  And I was I've got so much other big news to get.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]  I don't normally like to talk about news that we're involved in, but I would cover this
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.000]  if I wasn't right in the middle of it as our top story.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:24.000]  But I'm going to hit all the other news.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]  There's also some really good news of amazing things happening.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]  I'm going to skip this network break coming up.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]  So we have more time here together.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:33.000]  But let me just get this out of the way.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:34.000]  This is really important.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:35.000]  And I'm so impressed.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.000]  I've hung out and, you know, had a pastor, Rodney Howard Brown, on my show in person
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]  and met him and known him for.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.000]  It's got to be pleasure to have a pastor, Rodney Howard Brown, on a decade ago or so.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]  I've been watching for 15 years.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]  And he's got ministries and churches that he's launched all over the world.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:54.000]  He's an amazing individual.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.000]  And so we talk about InfoWars being the command center of the anti-globalist resistance
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]  that creates the research and talking points that everybody else picks up.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000]  That's really true.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:09.000]  This is a major command base for, you know, truly Christ-based Holy Ghost power.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]  And that's what it all is about.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.000]  If you're not feeling the power of God, well, you're not jacked in, folks.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.000]  It's 100% all about the Holy Ghost.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:19.000]  That's the one that connects to you and connects you to the Son and to the Father.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]  That's God's hand on you.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:23.000]  That's God's literal blanket.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]  And you can definitely feel it here.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]  Very, very strong.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]  So it's Revival.com, just like it sounds, Revival.com.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:33.000]  Not hard to miss.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.000]  And you can go to the River Church.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:37.000]  It's not hard to find.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:39.000]  It's a huge complex.
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:43.000]  They've got their own gardens, their own farms, their own TV and radio studios.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]  I mean, it is amazing.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]  That is their smaller church that holds about 600 people.
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.000]  They have another that holds 10,000.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]  And another that holds, I think it's 4,000.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]  But two are indoor, one is outdoor.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]  It's amazing.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]  Huge aircraft hangar where 10,000 people can be.
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]  But we're going to be out in that Sunday in the morning for the main service.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000]  And then on Sunday night, and I'll be at both services, starting at 7 p.m.,
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]  we're going to go as long as the pastor wants to go.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:15.000]  You'll be able to...
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]  And so we're just going to get up and take hours and hours of your questions.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000]  That is Sunday night.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000]  It's free.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]  It's open.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000]  You can't miss it.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]  It's the River Church in beautiful Tampa, Florida.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]  And it's in the middle of a rainforest, in the middle of a jungle here, quite literally.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]  So you want to come here, you want to be here.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.000]  And he just decided to do this last night.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]  He just invited me here to be his guest, and he decided he wants to do that.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:45.000]  Put out over all of his satellites and more to millions and millions of viewers.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000]  So revival.com, and that is this Sunday.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]  And it'll be...
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]  The church is in the morning at 9.30 a.m.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:56.000]  It kicks off.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]  You want to get here early.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]  Plenty of parking.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]  Tons of security.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000]  Great place.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]  You feel really secure here with all the great Christian patriots.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:04.000]  I mean, I don't want to tell you how many security guys he's got,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]  but he's ready to take over our country today.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:09.000]  So you've got that going on and so much more.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.000]  So the river, revival.com.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]  We'll see you here for the main church service.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:22.000]  And if 500, 600 people show up and are here early,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:28.000]  they're going to move it into the main sanctuary that holds 4,000 or 5,000 or 3,000 or 4,000.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000]  It's big.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]  And if that overflows, which I don't think it will in just two days' notice, three days' notice,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:36.000]  they'll move it to the giant area outside with the big fans and all the rest of it.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.000]  It's really, really nice.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]  Something to see.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]  But you'll get to see it all when you come in to the church.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.000]  This is all right next to each other.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:47.000]  You've got the big tabernacle right here.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]  And then you've got the giant outdoor pavilions.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:53.000]  And then you've got this compact broadcast.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]  Well, it's not compact, but more compact compared to that.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:02.000]  This studio is attached to the place where we're scheduled Sunday at 7 p.m.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]  for an evening with yours truly, Alex Jones.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]  TheRevival.com.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]  I'll be telling you about that throughout the next few days.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:15.000]  And Pastor Rodney Howard-Brown is going to be in studio with us in the third hour today.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000]  We'll be talking about the Great Awakening, which I forgot to send to my crew.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000]  There's a clip of him in the early 1990s talking about God bringing a great awakening.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]  And it's funny what he said to me this morning.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:31.000]  He goes, I want to play that on your show and talk about the Great Awakening and biblically what it means
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:35.000]  and the fact that we've had several Christian great awakenings with the Protestant Reformation
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.000]  and what came out of that.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000]  And he's been saying he believes I think the third or someone said the fourth great awakening is here.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000]  And I've been saying that for decades as well, but not just from a spiritual or Christian perspective,
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]  which is the heart and core of it, the fount of it, the presenter of it, where it all comes from,
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]  but just a general awakening to Satan and the new world order, which you see everywhere.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:57.000]  And then people territorialize it very strangely.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000]  We've woken up a lot of people and our listeners have, and they forget who woke them up.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:03.000]  Well, I never forget who woke me up.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:06.000]  That's why this is not territorialized information.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]  But when I talk about the Great Awakening and my new books can be called that
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:14.000]  and Mickey Willis' new films called that, it's because that's what this is,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:18.000]  is the new renaissance of awakening and the next great enlightenment,
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:21.000]  but with God at the center of it.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]  And then the Q people say, well, that's our saying.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000]  You stole that from us.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]  And you also say I stole Bohemian Grove from you,
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:30.000]  and Alex Jones stole Bilderberg coverage from the Q people.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.000]  And what they are is they're children in their awakening, many of them,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.000]  and they want to believe everything's okay.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]  And then they hear me talking about stuff they heard from Q, and they go,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]  you didn't sneak into Bohemian Grove.
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000]  Q did.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]  You didn't sneak into Bilderberg.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]  Jim Tucker didn't do that.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:47.000]  Westbrook Crackler didn't do that in the 60s.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:48.000]  Q did that.
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:51.000]  And you didn't interview Trump, and you didn't get Trump elected.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:52.000]  Q did.
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:54.000]  And you never snuck into Bohemian Grove.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:55.000]  And I agree.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]  Q did all that.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.000]  The point is, is that it's not a competition with that.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:03.000]  It's about understanding that I told you Biden was not going to be removed
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.000]  by special forces and all this on January 20th, 2021.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:09.000]  That was a globalist coup.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]  I told you the sealed indictments aren't coming for them.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.000]  They're coming for us.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:19.000]  And not to scare you, but so people will get in the reality of how much
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]  trouble we're in and not be led around by these FBI agents posing as Q
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.000]  leaders and intelligence agents.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000]  Because just like they infiltrated the militias in the 90s and the 2000s
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]  to find the weak-minded people they could set up to then create the illusion
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.000]  of terror attacks coming from the right wing, they're doing it now.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]  They're saying the right wing is getting ready to blow everything up and
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]  kill everybody around America and be violent.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000]  And we know the feds from Michigan to January 6th have been running around
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]  trying to create kidnapping plots, all of it.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]  And they use the Q movement as the doorway to tell people we're
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]  intelligence agents, we're with you, go do this.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.000]  And you're like, well, I'm not going to do that.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]  Well, you're a good person.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]  But there are people that are mentally unstable.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.000]  And that is what I'm talking about.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:06.000]  Like this National Front Group, 100% feds, 100%.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:09.000]  So, again, what would the feds do in the 90s and 2000s when I exposed and
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]  stopped a bunch of FBI plots trying to weaponize militias?
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.000]  The FBI informants and leaders would tell their militia,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]  Jones says the militia is unconstitutional.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]  And Jones says the militia is all feds.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.000]  He says, you're a fed.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]  I say you ought to go get it right now.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.000]  And then he goes out and gets in his FBI car and drives off.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:30.000]  The militia is constitutional.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000]  The militia is what all able-bodied men and now women are in self-defense.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]  It's the civil defense.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.000]  It's in the Second Amendment.
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:40.000]  The right to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:41.000]  We'll regulate militia.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:42.000]  That's the people.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000]  I'm not against the militia.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.000]  I am the militia.
[00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.000]  You are the militia.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:48.000]  I'm saying the feds go and take over the militias,
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.000]  which came out to weaponize them.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:52.000]  Remember the Hattari militia?
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]  I saw them doing a recruitment video where they have a guy standing up like
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]  a dictator with people standing behind him at a desk.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]  And I said, that's FBI produced to make us look like idiots.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:04.000]  And it turned out it was FBI produced.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.000]  And they set him up and sent a bunch of them to prison wrongfully.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]  They had one mistrial.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000]  So I'm harping on this now because there are major attempts and major moves
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.000]  to get us to be violent.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.000]  And we need to get ahead of that because they said the number one terror threat
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]  is Christian right-wing conservatives with no evidence and no right-wing terror.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.000]  Okay?
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:27.000]  That's the main focus now because Biden is demonizing his opposition to send
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:31.000]  us all to jail or to start a civil war.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:37.000]  And so that's why we've got to be as wise and peaceful as doves and serpents,
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.000]  as the Bible tells us.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.000]  I think that's an exodus.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:43.000]  But the point is, is that they're setting us up.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:45.000]  The good news is almost everybody sees it.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:48.000]  And when the feds try to stir up their garbage on Twitter and Facebook
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]  and Instagram, people shoot it down metaphorically very, very quickly.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.000]  So that is the good news.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.000]  Okay.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:56.000]  So thank you for joining us.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:58.000]  Let me tell you what's coming up today.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:01.000]  And then I'll hit our top story that I'm right in the middle of.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:06.000]  20-page article at the Washington Post.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:07.000]  It is behind a paywall.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.000]  I've tried to find a version that's not behind a paywall so we can post
[00:19:10.000 --> 00:19:12.000]  on InfoWars, but we have not found one yet.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:14.000]  I have the full thing in my email.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:17.000]  And it would take three hours to actually read it on there.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]  It's 20 pages long.
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]  But I am going to go over some of the notes I wrote about the article
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.000]  because it is incredible.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.000]  So that's coming up.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.000]  And, oh, where's Owen today?
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]  Oh, he's on an airplane flying to D.C. to face prison time.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]  Okay, because he was at the Capitol and didn't go inside to try to stop
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:32.000]  people going inside.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:34.000]  The feds indicted him.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]  So, again, I'm just showing you how real this is.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]  Oh, he's going to plead guilty.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]  Oh, he admits he's guilty.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:43.000]  Yeah, the charging says he went to the Capitol.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:44.000]  He didn't.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.000]  But the feds don't care.
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:47.000]  They got judges and people that say, I don't care.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:49.000]  The FBI is allowed to lie in court, folks.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.000]  Okay?
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.000]  So, and people say, well, why did they indict me?
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:58.000]  Because I know they set it up, and I know how they ran the attack,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.000]  and they know I won't shut up.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000]  And that's actually why the Justice Department, Merrick Garland,
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:07.000]  and it's come out, told the feds, no, you're not indicting Alex Jones
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:09.000]  and Roger Stone.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:13.000]  It says in here, because you have no evidence, no probable cause.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]  But the real reason is, we're not going to shut up.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:18.000]  We know how the feds did it now.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]  We know their names.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:24.000]  We know that there were D.C. police in there running the breakthrough
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000]  to get people into the building.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:31.000]  So, I'm going to take my time on this subject.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:34.000]  I'm going to cover it next hour.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.000]  It is a big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big,
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:43.000]  big, big deal, and it leads right in to what is currently happening,
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]  ladies and gentlemen.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:50.000]  It plays right in to what they're planning next.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:53.000]  So, those that don't know history are doomed to repeat it.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:55.000]  This is not about going back over January 6th.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:59.000]  This is about a 35,000-foot view of all the things that have unfolded
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]  and why it's unfolding and why it's all going down
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]  and how we are smart enough not to get caught in their next trap.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:12.000]  Okay, without further ado, ladies and gentlemen, let's go ahead now
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:18.000]  and let's start going through the news we're going to cover.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:22.000]  We have some really good news on the pedo-cult, globalist,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]  dehumanization, depopulation attack.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]  That's one of their main attacks on humanity.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]  The U.K., as you know, last week banned transgender surgeries
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:34.000]  and puberty blockers for 17 and down.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]  I said this is the globalist, knowing that they've pushed too hard.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]  Now look for Europe to ban it next.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000]  Then the rest of the world, but not the United States,
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]  were targeted for total destruction, and voila,
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000]  Europe's moving now to ban the mutilation of children.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:52.000]  Of course they should.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:55.000]  I mean, five years ago, we tried to go to the doctor and said,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:58.000]  Doctor, I'm trans-able.
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:59.000]  That's a real cult movement.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]  Hundreds of thousands have had even their limbs cut off.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:03.000]  I want to be what's called a nugget.
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:04.000]  That's where you have your arms and legs cut off.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:06.000]  It's a homosexual fetish thing.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]  I can tell you about that, but they're teaching our kids.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]  Mexico has whole colonies of these people that have their arms and legs removed.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000]  They live in boxes.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.000]  I won't tell you the rest of it.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:14.000]  It's truly just beyond disgusting.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:16.000]  It's the only stuff Satan can come up with.
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:21.000]  But if I went into an emergency room and said,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:24.000]  Doctor, I feel like I need to cut my arm off,
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]  they'd say, well, let us put you in a truck and send you to a loony bin.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]  But they've shut down most of the loony bins now in the state hospitals.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]  They say, oh, let's cut that arm right off.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:33.000]  Actually, that's not state-sponsored yet,
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:35.000]  but they're talking about making it state-sponsored.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:37.000]  But if you want to cut somebody's genitals off,
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:39.000]  especially a child that can't make their own decision,
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]  and has whacked out parents, well, let's do it as young as seven years old.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:49.000]  It now comes out that major university and, quote,
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:53.000]  religious hospitals have done here in the United States,
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:54.000]  not just Europe.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]  That came out about a month ago.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000]  So the good news is Europe does about face on transgender therapy for children,
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000]  but then it gets even sicker.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]  And I'm going to tell you about this coming up,
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]  but first I want to tell you the other news.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]  Report is out of Boston, Massachusetts.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:14.000]  Four children found in Boston-run housing with drag queens.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:15.000]  Oh.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.000]  Drugs, sex toys, and a dead body.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:22.000]  And they were hiding the children in a closet when the fire department got there
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]  and no one knows whose children they are.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:27.000]  Now, normally you'd say a bunch of pervert men dressed like women were found
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.000]  with a dead body and a bunch of drugs and kids they grabbed.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:31.000]  But, oh, it's drag queen.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]  Oh, okay.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:36.000]  Then the media is not covering this because, oh, drag queen.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.000]  It's a man dressed up in a clown outfit.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.000]  Clown queen shows.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:40.000]  Clown shows.
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]  That's what these drag queen clown shows are.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000]  It's fat, ugly men dressed in clown outfits.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:47.000]  I mean, they're scarier than a clown.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.000]  So first they steal a woman's identity and say they're a woman.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]  The new definition is a fat man with a beard in a clown outfit.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]  And then it moves on to they're going to have sex with their kids.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.000]  Like, well, it's their culture.
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:23:59.000]  They have sex with children.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:02.000]  So that's coming up with a bunch of other news.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:06.000]  We've also got NATO wants Ukraine on fast track to officially join NATO,
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]  something they said was not going to happen.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:12.000]  Zelensky threatens Americans, questions U.S. presidential candidates
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:13.000]  calling for Ukraine peace.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]  He says, are you ready for war?
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:16.000]  We're going to look at that.
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:18.000]  We also have MSNBC race baiter.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]  It says conservative Supreme Court justice should be taken and killed.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]  Like the people of the Titanic sub.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000]  I can't make that up.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.000]  That's the loving liberals.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:31.000]  New emails through four documents show COVID vaccine mandates
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000]  were based on a line the CDC knew in 2021.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.000]  As the program rolled out, they did not work,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]  but kept it from the public.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.000]  And we have a big article here on that.
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:43.000]  Cleveland Clinic's groundbreaking study released another finding,
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:45.000]  which contradicts CDC narrative.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000]  Those not up to date on COVID-19 vaccination had a lower risk of COVID-19
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]  than those up to date.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:56.000]  And, you know, the pastor literally 20 minutes before he was in here,
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:25:01.000]  Pastor Brown, and he instructed his amazing crew here in his satellite
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000]  command center to live stream out on all the satellites this show today.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:12.000]  But then I didn't think to ask or say our feed that is going out of Austin
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:16.000]  that we're connected to sends out all the articles and the videos to back up
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:17.000]  what I'm saying.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:21.000]  And they overlay a lot of what I'm saying and shots of what I'm saying.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]  So you can see that I'm not just pulling this out of the air.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.000]  Are you sitting on a raw feed of me here, guys?
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:29.000]  Or are you taking the info or speed you're putting on satellite?
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.000]  You're taking our mixed feed.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:32.000]  What geniuses?
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000]  I didn't have to think of that.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:34.000]  Okay.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000]  I'm impressed because I didn't think of that.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.000]  Okay.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:37.000]  You guys are taking the mixed feed.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:38.000]  That's great.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:39.000]  Okay.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.000]  Good.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:42.000]  I mean, do they know I actually have these articles here?
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000]  Actually, when I tell you the Washington Post admits that there was a secret plan
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:50.000]  to frame me, we're going to put that on screen for you,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:51.000]  and you can go read it for yourself.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:53.000]  Again, unfortunately, it's behind a paywall,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:54.000]  but you can read the first two pages.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:58.000]  So obviously I need one of my writers to go pull out the quotes,
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.000]  and it's not stealing their writing, and it's not plagiarism because we're going
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:03.000]  to give them credit, and it's about us, so it's fair use,
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:07.000]  and write a big article with large excerpts about how they tried to frame us
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]  because that's really what this is.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:11.000]  But they're just cleaning up for the FBI right now.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000]  Again, I'm going to explain all this next hour, but it is a bombshell report
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:19.000]  because they're just spinning all the illegal things they did as,
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:22.000]  don't worry, the higher-ups of the Justice Department killed it.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:24.000]  And I told you this a lot.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.000]  They had grand juries open trying to indict me all the time,
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:31.000]  and they were so sure with my bankruptcy,
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:35.000]  there was a reorganization for Infowars among personal bankruptcy,
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]  that they were going to find criminal activity.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]  And so they put all over the news things that weren't true
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:44.000]  and just complete 100% lies, 100% lies about us in the last year.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.000]  Now you hear nothing about it because none of it was true.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000]  And they sent in the CIA, the FBI, an international private investigation unit.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]  They offered private individuals money.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]  They tried to infiltrate our operations.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:01.000]  They tried to pay people to say that I had at least these groups,
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:06.000]  the FBI, that I was doing all this stuff to women, totally untrue.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:12.000]  That I'm on drugs, that I'm attacking people, just all of it.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:13.000]  Of course, none of it was true.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000]  And even offering people money, they couldn't find anybody to bear false witness.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.000]  That's been going on.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000]  Also, I'd be out on the street or at an event and pose with a woman in a picture.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:26.000]  They did Facebook data mining and Instagram data mining
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]  and contacted that we know of hundreds of women because dozens called us
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.000]  and said, called the office,
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.000]  hey, I met you once with my husband at an event or at a restaurant.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:35.000]  You were nice. Talk to us.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.000]  I got a call from a private investigation group out of London,
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]  and they were offering me money to ask if I did anything to attack you.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]  And I only talked to you 30 seconds.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:45.000]  Do you know about this?
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:46.000]  Yeah.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:51.000]  And then I did have a few girls I dated in between when my ex-wife divorced me
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:53.000]  almost 10 years ago.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.000]  And I didn't meet my current wife and stuff for a year or so,
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]  and we didn't get married until seven years ago.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:27:59.000]  And so there was a couple of years where I did date.
[00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.000]  And I had a couple of those girlfriends call and say,
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.000]  they called to offer me money.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:04.000]  I told them what a nice guy you were, what a gentleman you were,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.000]  what a teddy bear you were.
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]  So I'm not feeling sorry for myself.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]  I just want you to know, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]  that can you imagine what Trump's gone through?
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:12.000]  It's a hundred times this at least.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]  And can you imagine what everybody goes through?
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.000]  Can you imagine what Pastor Brown goes through?
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:19.000]  You never even hear about the stuff that he goes through.
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:21.000]  Fighting for God, fighting for the truth,
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:25.000]  fighting for your future forever with Christ.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.000]  This is a serious war.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.000]  But, you know,
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.000]  this has all been a great blessing in a way because I've gotten to really
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.000]  experience how evil the enemy is and learn their tricks and gotten to see
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:36.000]  them up front and who they are.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]  And the devil operates in compartmentalization.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.000]  Most of the military are not bad people.
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]  Most of the FBI are not bad people.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000]  Most people in government are not bad people.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]  In fact, they're some of the most elite people out there.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.000]  I run into them.
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:47.000]  I talk to them.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:48.000]  I see them.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:49.000]  You know, I come through customs.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.000]  Like, hey, we love you, Alex.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.000]  You're right.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000]  The TSA, all of them.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.000]  But it's the people on top and it's these special units.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.000]  And it's the same unit out of DC that ran the Michigan Whitmer
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]  kidnapping plot that ran the January 6th.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000]  A lot of people have asked me,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:05.000]  why is InfoWars Store at InfoWars Live not at a probiotic for more than three years?
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:06.000]  The answer is simple.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]  We only bring you the highest quality at the lowest prices.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000]  We had a top maker, top certified of probiotics for more than seven years.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:16.000]  They got bought by a libtard company and said,
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:19.000]  we're not doing business with you, Mr. Jones, anymore.
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:25.000]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000]  We're able to private label it under InfoWars MD as our probiotic formula.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:33.000]  So you can get a super high quality probiotic for amazing gut health and more

[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]  Now, wherever you get your probiotics, it's something everybody should be doing.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:41.000]  But I'm asking you to try our probiotic.
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:44.000]  I think you're going to have an amazing effect and it funds our entire operation.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:48.000]  So get your InfoWars MD probiotic today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:51.000]  It's a high quality formula and it keeps us on the air.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:54.000]  Take action now at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:00.000]  You wanted to plug RainForce. Do you like RainForce?
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]  Yeah. So my name is Ken Heckin-Ladley.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:06.000]  How do I write all the books that I do?
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]  Four books with Dr. Judy Mykovitz, four books with Project Veritas Whistleblowers,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]  and now two books with Alex Jones?
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]  That's because I use RainForce every day.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:19.000]  What I always need is I always need some sort of boost in the morning.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.000]  And so, you know, I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:28.000]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is RainForce.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:32.000]  I'll take RainForce in the morning right before I go to my computer,
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:36.000]  and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.000]  So it really is true that RainForce is something I use every day and it helps me with my writing.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]  All right. We love you. We'll be right back.
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:49.000]  Get your RainForce Plus, RainForce Ultra, and TurboForce at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.000]  We'll be right back with our number two.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:05.000]  We have three original one-of-a-kind toothpastes designed by my father, a dentist,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:11.000]  at InfoWarsStore.com that don't have fillers, that are filled with high-quality essential oils, and more.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:13.000]  We have the turmeric toothpaste.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:16.000]  We have the ultimate tooth whitening with pearl calcium toothpaste.
[00:31:16.000 --> 00:31:19.000]  And we have the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste, again,
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]  with a whole bunch of key essential oils that are so good not just for your teeth and your gums,
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]  but your whole mouth, your throat, and more.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]  These are really game-changing toothpastes.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:28.000]  They're very, very strong.
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:30.000]  Most over-the-counter toothpastes have fluoride.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.000]  Ours don't.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]  And it doesn't have fillers in it.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:39.000]  It is just chock full of incredible things that God gave us through Mother Nature.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]  So it's now back in stock.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:42.000]  It became a bestseller.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]  The turmeric toothpaste is available again at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.000]  We're selling out of the tooth whitening toothpaste.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:48.000]  We've got some of that left.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000]  And we also have some of the amazing activated charcoal toothpaste in stock, but it's running out as well.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:57.000]  So all three toothpastes in stock for a limited time, InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.000]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]  I don't think anybody can deny it.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:09.000]  And it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:18.000]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:23.000]  And when you look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day,
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000]  five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000]  So for myself and the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:37.000]  And I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us.
[00:32:37.000 --> 00:32:38.000]  I know you spread the word.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:39.000]  I know you pray for us.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:40.000]  And that's wonderful.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:41.000]  Keep doing it.
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:46.000]  Listeners, never go to InfoWarsStore.com and you never buy great products that enrich and empower your life
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:48.000]  while at the same time keeping us on air.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000]  I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com.
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:57.000]  If just 1% more of you took action and went to InfoWarsStore.com, our funding problems will be over.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:58.000]  Please take action now.
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:08.840]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[00:33:09.150 --> 00:33:38.790]  Coming to you live from beautiful Tampa, Florida at The River after Rodney Howard Brown's
[00:33:38.790 --> 00:33:45.390]  amazing church and evangelistic media complex reaching hundreds and hundreds of millions
[00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:47.670]  of people every year.
[00:33:47.670 --> 00:33:49.030]  Thank you again so much for joining us.
[00:33:49.030 --> 00:33:55.710]  I will be at his huge Sunday services where up to 10,000 people attend on Sunday.
[00:33:55.710 --> 00:34:00.110]  And then Sunday evening, we're going to go into the inside church, depending on how big
[00:34:00.110 --> 00:34:05.070]  the crowd is, either they're small one or they're medium-sized one that holds 4,000.
[00:34:05.070 --> 00:34:06.070]  And so look for that.
[00:34:06.070 --> 00:34:07.070]  It's free.
[00:34:07.070 --> 00:34:08.070]  It's open to the public.
[00:34:08.070 --> 00:34:14.390]  If you live anywhere in Florida, you should really jump in the car with the wife and children
[00:34:14.390 --> 00:34:21.630]  or the husband of the kids and just come on down or come on up to this event.
[00:34:21.630 --> 00:34:22.630]  You're in Georgia.
[00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:23.630]  You're only a few hours away.
[00:34:23.630 --> 00:34:27.950]  So or Alabama or any of those places, we would hope to see you here.
[00:34:27.950 --> 00:34:28.950]  It's a great place.
[00:34:28.950 --> 00:34:32.590]  And if you've always wanted to come see Pastor Rodney Howard Brown's amazing church and family,
[00:34:32.590 --> 00:34:36.790]  then this is the place and this is the time.
[00:34:36.790 --> 00:34:37.790]  Revival.com, Revival.com.
[00:34:37.790 --> 00:34:43.750]  And again, I'm Alex Jones with InfoWars.com, NewsWars.com, and Band.Video, where you don't
[00:34:43.750 --> 00:34:48.830]  just find my show and Shroyer's show and Harrison Smith's show and our other reporters' broadcasts
[00:34:48.830 --> 00:34:56.630]  with reports, but where you will also find hundreds of other band contributors at Band,
[00:34:56.630 --> 00:35:02.390]  just the word band, like it's band, speech, Band.Video.
[00:35:02.390 --> 00:35:05.950]  Or sometimes you can't share that URL because the censors online will block it.
[00:35:05.950 --> 00:35:11.790]  The URL that takes you there is MadMaxWorld, one word, MadMaxWorld, that's what the globalists
[00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:17.550]  are building, MadMaxWorld.TV, MadMaxWorld.TV.
[00:35:17.550 --> 00:35:18.550]  And there it is on the screen.
[00:35:18.550 --> 00:35:23.870]  You can always just go to InfoWars.com and find all the news feeds, the live feeds, and
[00:35:23.870 --> 00:35:24.870]  more.
[00:35:24.870 --> 00:35:27.790]  And again, I invite all the InfoWars listeners to go to Revival.com and to check out the
[00:35:27.790 --> 00:35:33.430]  amazing stuff, because he's building and has built their own food processing systems,
[00:35:33.430 --> 00:35:41.310]  their own farms, and their own cows, and their own sheep, and I just ate luscious South African-style
[00:35:41.310 --> 00:35:49.150]  marinated sheep right off their farm here when we got here Tuesday evening.
[00:35:49.150 --> 00:35:53.950]  So again, ladies and gentlemen, you definitely do not want to miss what is coming up.
[00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:57.590]  Okay, I'm already, like I always do, say I'm going to get to something later and then
[00:35:57.590 --> 00:36:02.430]  I start covering it now, but I need to really put my focus cap on and really break down
[00:36:02.430 --> 00:36:06.470]  what happened on January 6th and what's currently happened out of it, just the whole enemy plan
[00:36:06.470 --> 00:36:13.390]  to demonize the American people and list us as terrorists and really set up permanent
[00:36:13.390 --> 00:36:15.270]  martial law here in America.
[00:36:15.270 --> 00:36:20.950]  So everybody's talking about all of these army vehicles and all the stuff going on and
[00:36:20.950 --> 00:36:24.630]  saying, is martial law coming?
[00:36:24.630 --> 00:36:30.230]  People are seeing all of the movement and all the training and all the missile batteries
[00:36:30.230 --> 00:36:32.870]  being moved around and they say, is martial law coming?
[00:36:32.870 --> 00:36:34.150]  Is war coming?
[00:36:34.150 --> 00:36:37.830]  Yes, you're living under martial law with Joe Biden who stole the election.
[00:36:37.830 --> 00:36:40.350]  Yes, they've put continental government emergencies in.
[00:36:40.350 --> 00:36:44.790]  Yes, he declared a national emergency when he came in in January two and a half years
[00:36:44.790 --> 00:36:45.790]  ago.
[00:36:45.790 --> 00:36:47.790]  Yes, they're trying to train the military publicly.
[00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:52.910]  They show you the training videos that constitutionalists and Christians and gun owners are white supremacists
[00:36:52.910 --> 00:36:56.430]  and under a white supremacist definition, you're a terrorist, but obviously they can't lock
[00:36:56.430 --> 00:36:57.430]  us all up.
[00:36:57.430 --> 00:36:59.230]  It's a desperate act.
[00:36:59.230 --> 00:37:03.990]  Black Lives Matter, funded by the Democratic Party, says that if you're a Republican, you're
[00:37:03.990 --> 00:37:07.870]  a white supremacist, but there's not real black members of Black Lives Matter.
[00:37:07.870 --> 00:37:12.030]  It's all run by Soros Democratic Party and a bunch of racist white people who literally
[00:37:12.030 --> 00:37:16.670]  use racism to control people, the definition of racism.
[00:37:16.670 --> 00:37:20.710]  The good news is almost no one is buying this, but people keep waiting for it to be
[00:37:20.710 --> 00:37:23.670]  called martial law or waiting for it to be called a war.
[00:37:23.670 --> 00:37:28.230]  We're at war with Russia through NATO in a proxy war, a hybrid war.
[00:37:28.230 --> 00:37:29.950]  We are under this tyranny.
[00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:34.270]  We have to admit it's illegitimate and admit it's out of control and admit that the very
[00:37:34.270 --> 00:37:38.390]  central government that is doing all this has dissolved the borders.
[00:37:38.390 --> 00:37:41.030]  That's one of the three things the feds have jurisdiction over.
[00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:46.510]  They have jurisdiction over the Navy and the military, the coining of currency and the borders.
[00:37:47.350 --> 00:37:50.230]  They have jurisdiction over interstate commerce and all of that comes out.
[00:37:50.230 --> 00:37:53.510]  So the feds aren't doing their main jobs now.
[00:37:53.510 --> 00:37:58.670]  They turn the banking over to the Federal Reserve, that's policy for the treasury, basically.
[00:37:58.670 --> 00:37:59.990]  So that's backwards.
[00:37:59.990 --> 00:38:02.350]  And then they've dissolved the border.
[00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:03.990]  I'm not mad at our individual military.
[00:38:03.990 --> 00:38:08.550]  They're not our enemy, but they are under orders from Biden to go facilitate the smuggling
[00:38:08.550 --> 00:38:09.550]  at the border.
[00:38:09.550 --> 00:38:12.390]  And the head of the Border Patrol has said that publicly and the head of the reunion.
[00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:16.230]  So the Border Patrol is not our enemy, but they're in the enemy hands and they tell you,
[00:38:16.230 --> 00:38:18.310]  we are here to complete the smuggling.
[00:38:18.310 --> 00:38:23.470]  So that's what I wanted to get into is what's happening to our children and the attacks
[00:38:23.470 --> 00:38:26.590]  on our children and the fact that our children have been turned into a commodity.
[00:38:26.590 --> 00:38:33.030]  There is a viral video clip with tens of millions of views or different clips of it of Jim Caviezel,
[00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:37.950]  the great Christian actor that played in Passion of the Christ, the highest grossing film in
[00:38:37.950 --> 00:38:43.270]  history, I would add, just because a lot of the big top films are Christian showing.
[00:38:43.270 --> 00:38:44.270]  That's popular.
[00:38:44.270 --> 00:38:45.270]  What's folks want?
[00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:46.270]  There's a hunger for that.
[00:38:46.270 --> 00:38:50.990]  So it's not about the money, but it's about showing that our God is God and is popular
[00:38:50.990 --> 00:38:52.590]  despite the enemy's attacks.
[00:38:52.590 --> 00:38:53.590]  He went on The War Room.
[00:38:53.590 --> 00:38:56.430]  We want to invite him here with the great Steve Bannon.
[00:38:56.430 --> 00:39:00.830]  I'm going to skip this network break coming up to you guys.
[00:39:00.830 --> 00:39:05.350]  He went on with the great Steve Bannon and then the full clips on Infowars.com, it's
[00:39:05.350 --> 00:39:07.110]  like 30 minutes long.
[00:39:07.270 --> 00:39:13.430]  And he got into trafficking in children's body parts, and it has a metaphor for it called
[00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:14.430]  adrenochrome.
[00:39:14.430 --> 00:39:18.110]  So I'm going to tell you, is adrenochrome real?
[00:39:18.110 --> 00:39:20.150]  And what does it mean?
[00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:25.710]  And is Jim Caviezel, who has a huge blockbuster movie coming out about human trafficking that
[00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:30.390]  is based on a composite of three stories, in fact, we should get the trailer for that.
[00:39:30.390 --> 00:39:31.950]  I went to play it last week.
[00:39:31.950 --> 00:39:35.670]  Get that trailer too, I'll play that coming up.
[00:39:36.670 --> 00:39:38.870]  Before this hour ends in 20 minutes.
[00:39:38.870 --> 00:39:42.470]  The first time I'm going to play this clip, and then I want to go over with you, is his
[00:39:42.470 --> 00:39:43.630]  movie real?
[00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:49.230]  Is him talking about adrenochrome and selling children's body parts, is that real?
[00:39:49.230 --> 00:39:52.770]  And of course it is all real, and I could talk for 20 hours about it.
[00:39:52.770 --> 00:39:55.870]  The problem is when most people talk about it, it's like a metaphor.
[00:39:55.870 --> 00:40:01.270]  Like, oh yeah, I heard rich, powerful elites worship big idols in the woods and do mock
[00:40:01.270 --> 00:40:03.670]  human sacrifices of children.
[00:40:03.670 --> 00:40:06.630]  Well then I heard about that in like 1999.
[00:40:06.630 --> 00:40:09.670]  I looked and talked to experts and said, well where is it?
[00:40:09.670 --> 00:40:13.510]  Well there's some in Germany, some in England, and one in Northern California, and one in
[00:40:13.510 --> 00:40:17.430]  Connecticut at a place called Skull and Bones.
[00:40:17.430 --> 00:40:22.510]  That was inside a big building, but I confirmed from congressional testimony that it was true
[00:40:22.510 --> 00:40:27.830]  and they did worship Satan inside there and have homosexual sex and lie in coffins for
[00:40:27.830 --> 00:40:29.470]  days and ask demons to enter them.
[00:40:29.470 --> 00:40:33.790]  This is in the congressional record, Anthony Sutton, Charlotte Isserby's dad was a member.
[00:40:33.790 --> 00:40:37.790]  I mean, I could talk for an hour about Skull and Bones.
[00:40:37.790 --> 00:40:38.790]  And so what did I do?
[00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:43.790]  I infiltrated in 2000 Bohemian Grove on when they supposedly did the ritual that year,
[00:40:43.790 --> 00:40:47.430]  July 15th, every year, and I snuck through the secret service and all up by the grace
[00:40:47.430 --> 00:40:51.230]  of God with a hidden camera and got the footage of the ritual, and still to this day, it's
[00:40:51.230 --> 00:40:53.790]  the only footage of the ritual.
[00:40:53.790 --> 00:40:56.550]  And then they later confirmed it was all real.
[00:40:56.550 --> 00:40:59.590]  And then members have annals that are given out each year.
[00:40:59.590 --> 00:41:03.270]  World leaders go there, Prince Charles, you name it.
[00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:06.990]  Richard Nixon called it some things that I can't say, but he said it's a giant homosexual
[00:41:06.990 --> 00:41:07.990]  orgy.
[00:41:07.990 --> 00:41:10.190]  Just look up Richard Nixon on Bohemian Grove.
[00:41:10.190 --> 00:41:11.190]  There's audio of it.
[00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:12.190]  It's on the Nixon tapes.
[00:41:12.190 --> 00:41:15.270]  He says it's the most GD, faggoty thing you've ever seen.
[00:41:15.270 --> 00:41:17.510]  That's a quote by the president, not trying to say GD here.
[00:41:17.510 --> 00:41:21.030]  That's what he said on the tapes, on the Nixon tapes, he said a lot more.
[00:41:21.030 --> 00:41:23.410]  And he still had to go to be elected president.
[00:41:23.410 --> 00:41:25.910]  He didn't have sex with the men, but most of them do.
[00:41:25.910 --> 00:41:27.590]  I was pretty good looking back then when I snuck in.
[00:41:27.590 --> 00:41:33.030]  I was about 40 pounds lighter in 2000, and I got whistled at and my rear end pinched repeatedly.
[00:41:33.030 --> 00:41:37.990]  I had to hide under one of the cabins until it got dark, crawled out, got footage of the
[00:41:37.990 --> 00:41:38.990]  event.
[00:41:38.990 --> 00:41:41.470]  So there's the footage on screen for you.
[00:41:41.470 --> 00:41:47.510]  So when I tell you something, it's documented 99% of the time, or I tell you I'm speculating.
[00:41:47.510 --> 00:41:50.950]  So when I tell you that they're drinking children's blood, when I tell you they're sacrificing
[00:41:50.950 --> 00:41:54.270]  children, when I tell you they kidnap over a million kids a year in the U.S. alone, most
[00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:55.270]  I've never found.
[00:41:55.270 --> 00:41:58.150]  When I tell you they've trafficked millions of children across the border under Biden
[00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:00.830]  and they've been disappeared and put into sex slavery, that's not come out in the New
[00:42:00.830 --> 00:42:02.630]  York Times a month ago.
[00:42:02.630 --> 00:42:07.550]  I told you about it years ago, started under Obama, exploded under Biden, Trump stopped
[00:42:07.550 --> 00:42:08.550]  it.
[00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:14.030]  So that's the reality, ladies and gentlemen, of what's going on.
[00:42:14.030 --> 00:42:18.110]  That's the reality of what is happening.
[00:42:18.110 --> 00:42:22.470]  So when I tell you this sex trafficking and even the murder of children and the Jeffrey
[00:42:22.470 --> 00:42:26.230]  Epstein stuff that I was the first to break 15 years ago, I'm credited with that.
[00:42:26.230 --> 00:42:29.470]  Epstein Island, Little St. John's, I'm the first to expose it.
[00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:33.230]  I was the first to expose NXIVM, I was the first to expose it all.
[00:42:33.230 --> 00:42:35.710]  Because I had the sources, everybody else had them too, they're just scared to report
[00:42:35.710 --> 00:42:36.710]  it.
[00:42:36.710 --> 00:42:37.710]  Okay?
[00:42:37.710 --> 00:42:40.590]  So, oh, I hear there's a place in Northern California where they worship the devil.
[00:42:40.590 --> 00:42:43.310]  I'm going to go see if it's real.
[00:42:43.310 --> 00:42:44.870]  I've also been to Skull and Bones.
[00:42:44.870 --> 00:42:48.950]  I also, and I'm not bragging, I'm saying that's why they hate me, the enemy, for trying to
[00:42:48.950 --> 00:42:49.950]  put me in prison.
[00:42:49.950 --> 00:42:54.030]  I got the deathbed confession through his son of E. Howard Hunt.
[00:42:54.030 --> 00:42:57.350]  That's where the Ethan Hunt, Mission Impossible comes from.
[00:42:57.350 --> 00:42:59.390]  That's the guy he's based on.
[00:42:59.390 --> 00:43:01.590]  E. Howard Hunt.
[00:43:01.590 --> 00:43:03.430]  Worked for Richard Nixon before that for LBJ.
[00:43:03.430 --> 00:43:07.310]  He ran the murder of JFK in Dallas in November of 1963.
[00:43:07.310 --> 00:43:10.310]  I got the deathbed confession.
[00:43:10.310 --> 00:43:13.150]  They received it on Discovery Channel or History Channel, but it's still online.
[00:43:13.150 --> 00:43:14.150]  It's still there.
[00:43:14.150 --> 00:43:18.070]  He died, what, 13, 14 years ago.
[00:43:18.190 --> 00:43:20.470]  You know, when I tell you something, you can look it up.
[00:43:20.470 --> 00:43:26.750]  Now, let's play Jim Caviezel, where he's on there talking about body parts in Ukraine.
[00:43:26.750 --> 00:43:28.310]  And that is one of the biggest things in Ukraine.
[00:43:28.310 --> 00:43:29.550]  It's not just money laundering.
[00:43:29.550 --> 00:43:33.910]  It's the human body parts of men, women, and children, particularly men, but also a lot
[00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:34.910]  of children.
[00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:36.830]  But that's in mainline reports, but buried.
[00:43:36.830 --> 00:43:37.830]  Here's that clip.
[00:43:37.830 --> 00:43:44.510]  I believe, okay, so the agents that I've spoken to, all right, here's the, as for a barrel
[00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:51.950]  of oil, $77 for a barrel of body parts, and what's going to be adrenochrome, all the plumes
[00:43:51.950 --> 00:43:57.630]  that are in the woman's, mother's wombs, that goes from a plastic barrel, that's $77,000.
[00:43:57.630 --> 00:44:09.190]  Now that gets sent into these bio labs, $77, $77,000 for a barrel of body parts of children,
[00:44:09.190 --> 00:44:12.630]  blood, all of that goes to these bio labs.
[00:44:12.630 --> 00:44:15.350]  And then now go to Victoria Nuland's testimony.
[00:44:15.350 --> 00:44:17.910]  The bio labs, you're talking about the bio labs in Ukraine.
[00:44:17.910 --> 00:44:18.910]  Correct.
[00:44:18.910 --> 00:44:19.910]  What happened?
[00:44:19.910 --> 00:44:24.950]  And wherever else those places are, so, yes.
[00:44:24.950 --> 00:44:31.390]  Walk through the supply chain of the supply into the bio labs, what do they take?
[00:44:31.390 --> 00:44:35.270]  As far as the, I can't give you the molecular structure, I can give you the...
[00:44:35.270 --> 00:44:38.030]  What's this, the input of the body parts?
[00:44:38.030 --> 00:44:41.190]  All the waste, all the body waste, all of that.
[00:44:41.190 --> 00:44:42.190]  That's what they told me.
[00:44:42.750 --> 00:44:43.750]  That's what they're accumulating.
[00:44:43.750 --> 00:44:44.750]  Yes, that's one way.
[00:44:44.750 --> 00:44:47.710]  Again, it's probably not the ultimate way, but it's probably a diet coke.
[00:44:47.710 --> 00:44:50.630]  Who's organizing that?
[00:44:50.630 --> 00:44:54.750]  I would have to say definitely that it has to be in the three-letter agencies.
[00:44:54.750 --> 00:44:58.590]  So you are, your contention and what you want, you're, you're...
[00:44:58.590 --> 00:45:02.390]  I'm saying this, you say there's smoke, there's fire, okay?
[00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:08.630]  So if I say to a media person, two plus what equals five, and I say three, and the media
[00:45:08.630 --> 00:45:10.350]  will immediately say, how do you know?
[00:45:10.350 --> 00:45:12.110]  Did you see a three?
[00:45:12.110 --> 00:45:13.590]  That's what it's like.
[00:45:13.590 --> 00:45:16.910]  If you go to Vegas and you win a thousand hands in a row in blackjack, do you think
[00:45:16.910 --> 00:45:19.870]  there's cheating going on?
[00:45:19.870 --> 00:45:25.190]  At the level of $152 billion a year, this has to be making money for a lot of people
[00:45:25.190 --> 00:45:27.150]  and that cash has to be flowing through.
[00:45:27.150 --> 00:45:31.030]  Your contention is, it is impossible to have demand at that site and have supply.
[00:45:31.030 --> 00:45:32.030]  That's correct.
[00:45:32.030 --> 00:45:33.030]  And not have some sort of...
[00:45:33.030 --> 00:45:34.030]  Yes, yes.
[00:45:34.030 --> 00:45:35.030]  This can't be a random...
[00:45:35.030 --> 00:45:36.030]  No, no, no, no, no.
[00:45:36.030 --> 00:45:37.030]  But...
[00:45:37.030 --> 00:45:38.030]  It ends in Mexico.
[00:45:38.030 --> 00:45:40.910]  But the whole thing, just the thing with Ms. Rodas, she comes out and makes this testimony,
[00:45:40.910 --> 00:45:41.910]  this claim.
[00:45:41.910 --> 00:45:48.910]  Well, she said that 85,000 children have disappeared, and she's a whistleblower.
[00:45:48.910 --> 00:45:50.910]  85,000 of the kids are coming across...
[00:45:50.910 --> 00:45:51.910]  That's correct.
[00:45:51.910 --> 00:45:52.910]  ...this last year.
[00:45:52.910 --> 00:45:53.910]  And I would think that they would be pretty good...
[00:45:53.910 --> 00:45:54.910]  The next thing...
[00:45:54.910 --> 00:45:55.910]  I'll hit pause.
[00:45:55.910 --> 00:45:56.910]  ...to track anybody...
[00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:59.630]  Hit pause and back it up 10 seconds.
[00:45:59.630 --> 00:46:06.350]  I can't tell you my sources on this, but I've met with FBI agents, Border Patrol high level,
[00:46:06.350 --> 00:46:14.710]  federal marshals, and the highest level in the federal government below the attorney
[00:46:14.710 --> 00:46:15.710]  general.
[00:46:15.710 --> 00:46:19.990]  Now, people can figure out what that is, and I wasn't even told not to say this.
[00:46:19.990 --> 00:46:20.990]  I mean, I've...
[00:46:20.990 --> 00:46:24.190]  But even I don't want to say it because it gets too close.
[00:46:24.190 --> 00:46:25.190]  I mean, obviously, the feds know.
[00:46:25.190 --> 00:46:27.870]  I met with top federal judges, okay?
[00:46:27.870 --> 00:46:28.910]  And it's worse than that.
[00:46:28.910 --> 00:46:31.390]  It's hundreds of thousands of children, okay?
[00:46:31.390 --> 00:46:35.870]  And just in the Texas sector, it's 30,000 children given to 20,000 pedophiles.
[00:46:36.390 --> 00:46:42.070]  So they're coming across with the children in the Texas sector, and they try to indict
[00:46:42.070 --> 00:46:44.630]  them, and Merrick Garland says, you're not allowed to indict them.
[00:46:44.630 --> 00:46:47.710]  So the judges and the magistrates are not allowed to indict them.
[00:46:47.710 --> 00:46:49.430]  Now, what did they announce last week?
[00:46:49.430 --> 00:46:51.630]  Congress has been stripped...
[00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:55.990]  Biden has stripped the money and has ordered the Border Patrol not to do DNA testing of
[00:46:55.990 --> 00:47:00.550]  kids they find because they can check in like a day to see if that person is a relative.
[00:47:00.550 --> 00:47:04.750]  They know if it's first of kin or if it's an uncle or a cousin, okay?
[00:47:04.750 --> 00:47:06.910]  Or they know there's no DNA match, okay?
[00:47:06.910 --> 00:47:12.070]  They just give people with no IDs who are with children, kidnapped, give them the children.
[00:47:12.070 --> 00:47:14.710]  No more DNA testing, Washington Post, pull it up.
[00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:18.270]  I covered it last week and went crazy on air about it, okay?
[00:47:18.270 --> 00:47:19.270]  What he's...
[00:47:19.270 --> 00:47:21.710]  What this guy's saying, he's a great researcher, made a big movie, you know, played Jesus in
[00:47:21.710 --> 00:47:22.710]  the Passion of Christ.
[00:47:22.710 --> 00:47:23.710]  I've seen his videos.
[00:47:23.710 --> 00:47:24.710]  Really smart guy.
[00:47:24.710 --> 00:47:25.710]  I want to get him on the show.
[00:47:25.710 --> 00:47:26.710]  I don't know why he hasn't been on yet.
[00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:28.750]  But the point is, is Caviezel is...
[00:47:28.750 --> 00:47:32.790]  His source, obviously a fed, is saying 85,000.
[00:47:32.790 --> 00:47:36.870]  That's 85,000 in sex trafficking, folks, okay, in the last two and a half years.
[00:47:36.870 --> 00:47:42.790]  If it's 30,000 just in one area of Texas, it's over a million children.
[00:47:42.790 --> 00:47:45.830]  If you look at what happened under Obama and now under Biden.
[00:47:45.830 --> 00:47:48.550]  I've talked to a high level of the Border Patrol, 80% they're not catching.
[00:47:48.550 --> 00:47:51.310]  They don't even make contact with 80%, I guess.
[00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:55.750]  So when you hear that millions have come across just the last two and a half years and 300
[00:47:55.750 --> 00:47:56.750]  and something...
[00:47:56.750 --> 00:48:00.470]  It was like 380,000 is what Ted Cruz was saying in Congress last week with the Border Patrol
[00:48:00.470 --> 00:48:01.470]  heads there.
[00:48:01.670 --> 00:48:03.670]  So it's 380 something thousand.
[00:48:03.670 --> 00:48:04.670]  That's what they caught.
[00:48:04.670 --> 00:48:08.990]  Well, then if they're only catching 20%, can we do the math here?
[00:48:08.990 --> 00:48:12.910]  So what I'm saying is it's worse than they're even saying.
[00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:16.990]  You remember the governor video in Virginia five years ago?
[00:48:16.990 --> 00:48:21.150]  And we got the clip and it went viral, where he's on a radio show, but it's video too on
[00:48:21.150 --> 00:48:22.150]  the show.
[00:48:22.150 --> 00:48:25.630]  And he says, well, we keep babies comfortable after they're born and decide whether we're
[00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:28.350]  going to say they're human.
[00:48:28.350 --> 00:48:31.350]  And sometimes we don't say they're human and we keep them alive and harvest their organs
[00:48:31.350 --> 00:48:34.590]  a few weeks later, because then all the orders for their organs come in, they get a much
[00:48:34.590 --> 00:48:36.790]  higher price so they can keep the baby alive.
[00:48:36.790 --> 00:48:40.390]  Now it came out to Congress last year that they've delivered thousands of babies with
[00:48:40.390 --> 00:48:44.510]  their hearts still beating to US medical research labs.
[00:48:44.510 --> 00:48:50.910]  Type in babies with still beating hearts delivered to university and research facilities.
[00:48:50.910 --> 00:48:53.750]  That's mainstream news last year.
[00:48:53.750 --> 00:48:57.670]  Type in, learn what products have baby parts in them.
[00:48:57.670 --> 00:49:01.170]  Hundreds of products have baby essence in them as the flavoring.
[00:49:01.990 --> 00:49:02.990]  So, oh, is Adrenochrome real?
[00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:03.990]  Let's go further.
[00:49:03.990 --> 00:49:10.390]  I'd not watched Avatar, the new one, until last night.
[00:49:10.390 --> 00:49:13.930]  And I'm sitting there in my hotel room and I said, I'm going to finally watch this movie
[00:49:13.930 --> 00:49:16.330]  and see this environmentalist brainwashing.
[00:49:16.330 --> 00:49:17.330]  I watch it.
[00:49:17.330 --> 00:49:19.890]  I'm going to tell the crew this, guys, I'm sure it'll be online on YouTube.
[00:49:19.890 --> 00:49:21.210]  Somebody's had to grab it.
[00:49:21.210 --> 00:49:28.090]  Type in Adrenochrome, Avatar, the power of water or whatever it's called.
[00:49:28.090 --> 00:49:34.610]  They kill the whales for the Adrenochrome in their brain and get $70 million per container
[00:49:34.610 --> 00:49:35.610]  of the Adrenochrome.
[00:49:35.610 --> 00:49:38.810]  Now that's fiction, but they're throwing it in your face.
[00:49:38.810 --> 00:49:45.050]  So they kill this giant whale so they can sell the elites, get this, the essence of
[00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:52.410]  the pituitary gland of a space whale because it makes them live forever, Adrenochrome.
[00:49:52.410 --> 00:49:56.450]  So they're even putting it, and if you can't find it now, just download the movie, grab
[00:49:56.450 --> 00:49:58.690]  it, put it in post, and we upload this full show.
[00:49:58.690 --> 00:49:59.690]  Yeah, here it is.
[00:49:59.690 --> 00:50:00.690]  I found it.
[00:50:00.690 --> 00:50:05.930]  Two, spanned out video later because, again, we're live right now.
[00:50:05.930 --> 00:50:09.050]  So again, I could go on for a thousand hours here.
[00:50:09.050 --> 00:50:10.210]  What is life news?
[00:50:10.210 --> 00:50:11.210]  What did they all get?
[00:50:11.210 --> 00:50:12.210]  What about the FOIA request?
[00:50:12.210 --> 00:50:13.370]  What came out in court just last year?
[00:50:13.370 --> 00:50:18.210]  All over the United States, they sent babies, aborted babies, but the bioethics labs at these
[00:50:18.210 --> 00:50:21.130]  hospitals, they decide it's not a human.
[00:50:21.130 --> 00:50:24.570]  When they say, we decided we were going to resuscitate a baby or not, that is a term they
[00:50:24.690 --> 00:50:27.610]  use whether it's human, not whether we're going to start its heart.
[00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:31.730]  You think of resuscitate as if your heart stops, you get defibrillated, you get mouth-to-mouth
[00:50:31.730 --> 00:50:33.290]  or stuff like that.
[00:50:33.290 --> 00:50:40.250]  They call resuscitate, meaning we decide it's a human and save it and decide it has rights,
[00:50:40.250 --> 00:50:45.050]  or we decide whether to say it's not human and we say it's not resuscitated, but then
[00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:49.890]  it goes to a special area, is kept alive until they can blood type it and prepare and see
[00:50:49.890 --> 00:50:50.890]  the larger orders.
[00:50:50.890 --> 00:50:51.890]  Folks, look this up.
[00:50:52.890 --> 00:50:58.170]  PepsiCo says it will halt use of aborted fetal cells in flavor research, but that's worse
[00:50:58.170 --> 00:50:59.170]  than that.
[00:50:59.170 --> 00:51:01.450]  Some things actually have baby essence in them.
[00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:08.810]  The headline to pull up is, learn what products have baby parts in them, including the so-called
[00:51:08.810 --> 00:51:09.810]  vaccines.
[00:51:09.810 --> 00:51:13.610]  By the way, you guys found the scene where they kill the cow, that's what they call a
[00:51:13.610 --> 00:51:18.610]  female whale, and so that's what these movies are.
[00:51:18.610 --> 00:51:22.010]  The first avatar is cowboys in space, cowboys and Indians in space.
[00:51:22.010 --> 00:51:26.050]  The second one is whalers and natives in space.
[00:51:26.050 --> 00:51:31.490]  That's just what he does, remake old movies, but put it on this fictional planet of Pandora.
[00:51:31.490 --> 00:51:32.490]  They didn't find the clip I wanted.
[00:51:32.490 --> 00:51:36.650]  It's after they kill the whale, it's right before this.
[00:51:36.650 --> 00:51:41.890]  They go in and drill into its brain and take its adrenochrome.
[00:51:41.890 --> 00:51:44.050]  It's about a minute before this.
[00:51:44.050 --> 00:51:49.890]  They're throwing everything in your face, absolutely in your face.
[00:51:49.890 --> 00:51:52.330]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[00:51:52.330 --> 00:51:53.730]  This is the scene where they go out.
[00:51:53.730 --> 00:51:56.010]  Right there is where they go out and they hunt.
[00:51:56.010 --> 00:51:57.010]  They hunt it.
[00:51:57.010 --> 00:52:02.170]  Then about two minutes later, they kill it, and then about a minute later, they go into
[00:52:02.170 --> 00:52:06.890]  its body and go into its brain, its pituitary, and get the adrenochrome so the elites can
[00:52:06.890 --> 00:52:07.890]  live forever.
[00:52:07.890 --> 00:52:10.890]  We'll add it in post later, just enough of that.
[00:52:10.890 --> 00:52:16.250]  What I'm trying to get at for everybody here is this is everywhere, and yes, they admit
[00:52:16.250 --> 00:52:19.490]  they're selling organs of people that get killed in Ukraine, including the children,
[00:52:19.490 --> 00:52:23.690]  and yes, that's going on, and yes, that's happening, and we're being turned into a commodity
[00:52:23.690 --> 00:52:26.710]  under this new world order.
[00:52:26.710 --> 00:52:29.450]  I want people to know this.
[00:52:29.450 --> 00:52:35.970]  I want people to understand this, and that's what this whole satanic system is, is turning
[00:52:35.970 --> 00:52:36.970]  people.
[00:52:36.970 --> 00:52:37.970]  Yes, here's the scene.
[00:52:37.970 --> 00:52:38.970]  I'll keep this going.
[00:52:39.050 --> 00:52:45.930]  It's turning people into commodities, and that's what this whole system is, but God made you,
[00:52:45.930 --> 00:52:48.330]  but God won't take your free will.
[00:52:48.330 --> 00:52:49.690]  God doesn't treat you like a commodity.
[00:52:49.690 --> 00:52:54.850]  You have to decide to go with God, the Holy Spirit that has a mission for you, but because
[00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:58.950]  you have free will, you are allowed to sell yourself to the devil.
[00:52:58.950 --> 00:53:00.010]  It is transactional.
[00:53:00.010 --> 00:53:04.130]  You are allowed to get this petty power here on this earth and think you're cool, but you'll
[00:53:04.130 --> 00:53:05.730]  be totally alone in the end.
[00:53:05.730 --> 00:53:07.450]  The power of Satan is a joke.
[00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:15.130]  All of it is a giant curse, ladies and gentlemen, and so that's what this comes down to.
[00:53:15.130 --> 00:53:19.370]  So if you want to understand this, look up my film, Dark Secrets Inside Bohemian Grove,
[00:53:19.370 --> 00:53:20.730]  or just type in Alex Jones, Bohemian Grove.
[00:53:20.730 --> 00:53:23.890]  If you want to know about skull and bones, type in Alex Jones, skull and bones.
[00:53:23.890 --> 00:53:27.890]  If you want to know about the order of death, Alex Jones, the order of death, and you can
[00:53:27.890 --> 00:53:29.490]  still find it in spite of the censorship.
[00:53:29.490 --> 00:53:35.390]  It's still out there, and if you want to understand, look up Virginia governor talks about keeping
[00:53:35.390 --> 00:53:36.390]  babies comfortable.
[00:53:36.390 --> 00:53:40.590]  He goes, we make the decision to not resuscitate the baby.
[00:53:40.590 --> 00:53:42.830]  You think, oh, the baby died in surgery.
[00:53:42.830 --> 00:53:44.070]  Oh, it was in the car wreck.
[00:53:44.070 --> 00:53:45.070]  No, no, no.
[00:53:45.070 --> 00:53:50.350]  It's a nine-month, it's third trimester, and they say, we talk to the mother, whatever
[00:53:50.350 --> 00:53:51.350]  the issues with the baby.
[00:53:51.350 --> 00:53:52.350]  Does she want the baby?
[00:53:52.350 --> 00:53:54.990]  And if she doesn't want it, we do not resuscitate.
[00:53:54.990 --> 00:53:58.790]  If she wants it, she keeps it, and it lives, but he goes, but if we do not resuscitate,
[00:53:58.790 --> 00:54:02.550]  we keep it comfortable, but if you do not resuscitate, it means you're dead.
[00:54:02.550 --> 00:54:03.550]  No, no.
[00:54:03.550 --> 00:54:04.550]  Quote.
[00:54:04.550 --> 00:54:05.550]  Yeah, there is on video.
[00:54:06.110 --> 00:54:13.630]  If we do not resuscitate, we keep the baby comfortable until we harvest the organ.
[00:54:13.630 --> 00:54:15.110]  Say it again.
[00:54:15.110 --> 00:54:17.310]  They all use different language, legal language.
[00:54:17.310 --> 00:54:21.350]  The bioethics board at that medical center, which he used to work at, he's a baby harvester.
[00:54:21.350 --> 00:54:22.350]  They go, this guy's great.
[00:54:22.350 --> 00:54:23.950]  We'll put him in as a governor.
[00:54:23.950 --> 00:54:28.230]  He's up there mainline, telling the women and the people on TV and radio, we decide,
[00:54:28.230 --> 00:54:32.310]  and he goes, and the woman on the show goes, well, you get the police involved?
[00:54:32.310 --> 00:54:33.310]  The kids are ready.
[00:54:33.310 --> 00:54:34.310]  He goes, no, no, no.
[00:54:34.310 --> 00:54:35.310]  It's not a decision for the police.
[00:54:35.310 --> 00:54:40.710]  It's a decision for the mother and at least two doctors who were on the bioethics board,
[00:54:40.710 --> 00:54:43.150]  and even the liberal women are going, what?
[00:54:43.150 --> 00:54:45.090]  And then, don't worry, though.
[00:54:45.090 --> 00:54:47.030]  If we don't resuscitate, we keep baby comfortable.
[00:54:47.030 --> 00:54:50.230]  The women go, but resuscitate means save.
[00:54:50.230 --> 00:54:51.870]  The baby's already dead, right?
[00:54:51.870 --> 00:54:57.030]  No, we don't resuscitate if mama doesn't want it because it's not a baby now.
[00:54:57.030 --> 00:55:02.470]  They do a little magic trick where the baby is not a human now because the ethics board
[00:55:02.470 --> 00:55:08.150]  said only two members of the hospital board, they sign off and baby die.
[00:55:08.150 --> 00:55:11.830]  Now, maybe baby comes out and they hadn't done them, and the baby's got, maybe it's
[00:55:11.830 --> 00:55:12.830]  a Siamese twin.
[00:55:12.830 --> 00:55:14.910]  Oh, this is going to be terrible pain, blah, blah, blah.
[00:55:14.910 --> 00:55:17.390]  You don't want to resuscitate, do you?
[00:55:17.390 --> 00:55:19.510]  Well, still, it's the baby's outside the womb.
[00:55:19.510 --> 00:55:22.150]  Federal law says you can't kill them once they're outside, but Democrats are trying
[00:55:22.150 --> 00:55:25.310]  to pass laws to kill them once they've gotten out of the womb because sometimes a baby, when
[00:55:25.310 --> 00:55:30.670]  they're killing it nine months in, they call it, there's different terms doctors use, but
[00:55:30.670 --> 00:55:32.030]  they call it the disaster and things like that.
[00:55:32.590 --> 00:55:35.550]  Sometimes the baby just comes out, or the woman on the way there, the baby, you know,
[00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:36.550]  she has birth.
[00:55:36.550 --> 00:55:38.110]  And then they've been caught and gone to jail.
[00:55:38.110 --> 00:55:41.270]  They put them in buckets of water because technically they don't want to stab them and
[00:55:41.270 --> 00:55:44.190]  kill them themselves because the technical thing is they've committed murder one if they
[00:55:44.190 --> 00:55:45.190]  do that.
[00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:46.190]  So they just leave them out to die.
[00:55:46.190 --> 00:55:50.190]  Sometimes they live three or four days, then they don't sell those body parts because that
[00:55:50.190 --> 00:55:51.190]  was a human.
[00:55:51.190 --> 00:55:56.390]  Or you've got a lot of people, famous women, you know, and men that survived and got saved
[00:55:56.390 --> 00:55:57.670]  out of dumpsters.
[00:55:57.670 --> 00:55:58.670]  You know those cases, right?
[00:55:58.910 --> 00:55:59.910]  I forget the lady's name.
[00:55:59.910 --> 00:56:00.910]  She travels the country.
[00:56:00.910 --> 00:56:01.910]  Pretty blonde lady.
[00:56:01.910 --> 00:56:06.190]  She has a limp because they broke her leg when she was a baby thrown in the trash can.
[00:56:06.190 --> 00:56:09.430]  But the Christians, they go and they dig the babies out of the trash can.
[00:56:09.430 --> 00:56:10.430]  But see, those are babies.
[00:56:10.430 --> 00:56:11.430]  They didn't resuscitate.
[00:56:11.430 --> 00:56:12.430]  They just throw them in the trash can.
[00:56:12.430 --> 00:56:14.590]  But that was back before there was all the money going into all this.
[00:56:14.590 --> 00:56:18.950]  So people ask why I get so excited, why I talk so fast when I'm not on air sitting around
[00:56:18.950 --> 00:56:19.950]  talking to Pastor Howard.
[00:56:19.950 --> 00:56:21.430]  I'm like an old toad sitting there quiet.
[00:56:21.430 --> 00:56:22.430]  He goes, man, you don't talk a lot.
[00:56:22.430 --> 00:56:26.310]  But when I get on air, I jump around because I'm telling you all this stuff.
[00:56:26.310 --> 00:56:30.150]  I'm talking about videos with them saying, we kill babies.
[00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:31.830]  We kill babies and take their organs.
[00:56:31.830 --> 00:56:37.670]  And everybody sits around and ask the question, is Jim Caviezel telling the truth?
[00:56:37.670 --> 00:56:40.230]  I don't need to know if Jim Caviezel is telling the truth.
[00:56:40.230 --> 00:56:43.390]  I've done the research because I care and you care too.
[00:56:43.390 --> 00:56:45.990]  So let's stop asking, is martial law coming?
[00:56:45.990 --> 00:56:46.990]  It's here.
[00:56:46.990 --> 00:56:47.990]  Let's stop asking if we're going to have war.
[00:56:47.990 --> 00:56:49.070]  We're in war with Russia.
[00:56:49.070 --> 00:56:52.310]  Let's stop asking if they're killing babies and sucking their blood and their essences
[00:56:52.310 --> 00:56:53.830]  out and the pituitary glands.
[00:56:53.830 --> 00:56:56.110]  And they do call it adrenochrome.
[00:56:56.110 --> 00:56:57.110]  And they do sell it.
[00:56:57.110 --> 00:56:58.110]  Hunter S. Thompson confirmed it.
[00:56:58.110 --> 00:56:59.470]  But guess what?
[00:56:59.470 --> 00:57:03.830]  The Clintons on the company are part of it that has the patent and it's called adrenochrome
[00:57:03.830 --> 00:57:06.350]  and it's hiding in plain view so nobody talks about it.
[00:57:06.350 --> 00:57:12.030]  Go online and pull up an EpiPen, those things that cost $200 a piece, and pull up the packaging.
[00:57:12.030 --> 00:57:17.270]  Pull up EpiPen packaging and read what the chemical is that if you're having an allergic
[00:57:17.270 --> 00:57:21.710]  response you take to get you hired in a kite, by the way, it is adrenochrome.
[00:57:21.710 --> 00:57:24.190]  It's synthetic.
[00:57:24.270 --> 00:57:26.390]  And it's called adrenochrome.
[00:57:26.390 --> 00:57:28.190]  And it's in your face.
[00:57:28.190 --> 00:57:31.350]  So they got a drug called adrenochrome.
[00:57:31.350 --> 00:57:34.350]  They make top movies where they're sucking the adrenochrome out of whales.
[00:57:34.350 --> 00:57:35.350]  All to confuse you.
[00:57:35.350 --> 00:57:36.350]  Oh, is it real?
[00:57:36.350 --> 00:57:37.350]  Is it not?
[00:57:37.350 --> 00:57:38.350]  Is it not?
[00:57:38.350 --> 00:57:41.350]  Hunter S. Thompson was paid by Satanist adrenochrome.
[00:57:41.350 --> 00:57:42.830]  We'll be right back with hour number two.
[00:57:42.830 --> 00:57:43.830]  Stay with us.

[00:58:43.190 --> 00:58:46.190]  And the answer for energy is Brain Force.
[00:58:49.190 --> 00:58:52.190]  Turbo Force is back, sold out for eight months,

[00:59:34.190 --> 00:59:37.190]  But this is the King Kong.
[00:59:37.190 --> 00:59:39.190]  This is the boss.
[00:59:39.190 --> 00:59:43.190]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, InfoWarsTore.com.
[00:59:43.190 --> 00:59:46.190]  More power, more strength, more energy.
[00:59:49.710 --> 00:59:57.710]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:00:13.710 --> 01:00:15.710]  Alright, we got cut off by the break.
[01:00:15.710 --> 01:00:19.710]  I don't want to cut off what Jim Caviezel was saying.
[01:00:19.710 --> 01:00:21.710]  Yes, he's 100% on.
[01:00:21.710 --> 01:00:25.710]  And I notice, I get addicted to reading comments because they're so informative.
[01:00:25.710 --> 01:00:26.710]  Just to see where people are at.
[01:00:26.710 --> 01:00:28.710]  On Twitter, the left was freaking out going,
[01:00:28.710 --> 01:00:31.710]  you're insane, nobody sells baby's body parts.
[01:00:31.710 --> 01:00:35.710]  Nobody, I mean, Caviezel's not even telling you that they keep them alive.
[01:00:35.710 --> 01:00:38.710]  In many cases, and that's the headline, federal documents.
[01:00:38.710 --> 01:00:44.710]  Research centers got delivery of still beating babies with hearts beating.
[01:00:44.710 --> 01:00:46.710]  Fetuses with hearts beating.
[01:00:46.710 --> 01:00:48.710]  I mean, you can just type that in.
[01:00:48.710 --> 01:00:50.710]  Babies with beating hearts.
[01:00:50.710 --> 01:00:52.710]  Fetuses with beating hearts delivered to research centers.
[01:00:52.710 --> 01:00:53.710]  All over the United States.
[01:00:53.710 --> 01:00:55.710]  All over the world.
[01:00:55.710 --> 01:01:00.710]  And we sit here, and then we're like, oh, this is insane.
[01:01:00.710 --> 01:01:01.710]  There it is.
[01:01:01.710 --> 01:01:06.710]  New FDA records show purchases of fetal organs, heads, and tissues for humanized mice project.
[01:01:06.710 --> 01:01:08.710]  And if you go into there, still beating hearts.
[01:01:08.710 --> 01:01:11.710]  So, yeah, I have the governor.
[01:01:11.710 --> 01:01:13.710]  I just showed you the video.
[01:01:13.710 --> 01:01:14.710]  Put it on screen.
[01:01:14.710 --> 01:01:15.710]  You go pull it up.
[01:01:15.710 --> 01:01:17.710]  Maybe we should play the governor's video.
[01:01:17.710 --> 01:01:19.710]  Five minutes is the main part.
[01:01:19.710 --> 01:01:21.710]  You're like, yeah, you know, we keep baby alive.
[01:01:21.710 --> 01:01:25.710]  So, that's who these people are, folks.
[01:01:25.710 --> 01:01:28.710]  And that's why I get so angry.
[01:01:28.710 --> 01:01:32.710]  So, here is Caviezel laying it all out.
[01:01:32.710 --> 01:01:36.710]  I believe, okay, so the agents that I've spoken to.
[01:01:37.710 --> 01:01:41.710]  For a barrel of oil, $77.
[01:01:41.710 --> 01:01:48.710]  For a barrel of body parts and what's going to be adrenochrome, all the plumes that are in the mother's wombs.
[01:01:48.710 --> 01:01:50.710]  That goes into a plastic barrel.
[01:01:50.710 --> 01:01:51.710]  That's $77,000.
[01:01:51.710 --> 01:01:57.710]  Now, that gets sent into these bio labs.
[01:01:57.710 --> 01:01:59.710]  $77.
[01:01:59.710 --> 01:02:03.710]  $77,000 for a barrel of body parts, of children, blood.
[01:02:03.710 --> 01:02:06.710]  All of that goes to these bio labs.
[01:02:06.710 --> 01:02:09.710]  And then now go to Victoria New Orleans testimony.
[01:02:09.710 --> 01:02:10.710]  The bio labs.
[01:02:10.710 --> 01:02:11.710]  You're talking about the bio labs in Ukraine.
[01:02:11.710 --> 01:02:12.710]  Correct.
[01:02:12.710 --> 01:02:16.710]  And wherever else those places are.
[01:02:16.710 --> 01:02:18.710]  So, yes.
[01:02:18.710 --> 01:02:23.710]  Walk through the supply chain of the supply into the bio labs.
[01:02:23.710 --> 01:02:25.710]  What do they take?
[01:02:25.710 --> 01:02:28.710]  As far as the, I can't give you the molecular structure.
[01:02:28.710 --> 01:02:31.710]  What's this, the input of the body parts?
[01:02:31.710 --> 01:02:32.710]  All the waste.
[01:02:32.710 --> 01:02:33.710]  All the body waste.
[01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:34.710]  All of that.
[01:02:34.710 --> 01:02:35.710]  That's what they told me.
[01:02:35.710 --> 01:02:36.710]  As the stimulant in.
[01:02:36.710 --> 01:02:38.710]  Yes, that's one way.
[01:02:38.710 --> 01:02:41.710]  Again, it's probably not the ultimate way, but it's probably a diet coke.
[01:02:41.710 --> 01:02:43.710]  Who's organizing that?
[01:02:43.710 --> 01:02:48.710]  I would have to say definitely that it has to be in the three-letter agencies.
[01:02:48.710 --> 01:02:53.710]  So, your contention and what you want, and I'm saying this.
[01:02:53.710 --> 01:02:55.710]  You say there's smoke, there's fire.
[01:02:55.710 --> 01:02:56.710]  Okay.
[01:02:56.710 --> 01:03:02.710]  So, if I say to a media person, two plus what equals five, and I say three,
[01:03:02.710 --> 01:03:04.710]  and the media will immediately say, how do you know?
[01:03:04.710 --> 01:03:06.710]  Did you see a three?
[01:03:06.710 --> 01:03:07.710]  That's what it's like.
[01:03:07.710 --> 01:03:10.710]  If you go to Vegas and you win 1,000 hands in a row in blackjack,
[01:03:10.710 --> 01:03:13.710]  do you think there's cheating going on?
[01:03:13.710 --> 01:03:16.710]  At the level of $152 billion a year.
[01:03:16.710 --> 01:03:17.710]  Yes.
[01:03:17.710 --> 01:03:19.710]  This has to be making money for a lot of people,
[01:03:19.710 --> 01:03:21.710]  and that cash has to be flowing through.
[01:03:21.710 --> 01:03:25.710]  Your contention is it is impossible to have demand at that site and have supply.
[01:03:25.710 --> 01:03:26.710]  That's correct.
[01:03:26.710 --> 01:03:27.710]  And not have some sort of ordinance.
[01:03:27.710 --> 01:03:28.710]  Yes.
[01:03:28.710 --> 01:03:29.710]  This can't be a random.
[01:03:29.710 --> 01:03:30.710]  No, no, no, no, no.
[01:03:30.710 --> 01:03:31.710]  Games in Mexico.
[01:03:31.710 --> 01:03:33.710]  But the whole thing, just the thing with Ms. Rodas,
[01:03:33.710 --> 01:03:35.710]  she comes out and makes this testimony, this claim.
[01:03:35.710 --> 01:03:37.710]  This could disappoint our audience.
[01:03:37.710 --> 01:03:43.710]  Well, she said that 85,000 children have disappeared, and she's a whistleblower.
[01:03:43.710 --> 01:03:45.710]  85,000 of the kids are coming across.
[01:03:45.710 --> 01:03:46.710]  That's correct.
[01:03:46.710 --> 01:03:47.710]  This last year.
[01:03:47.710 --> 01:03:50.710]  And you would think that they would be pretty good to track anybody in.
[01:03:50.710 --> 01:03:53.710]  Steve, the next day the media didn't even pick it up.
[01:03:53.710 --> 01:03:54.710]  It's worthless to them.
[01:03:54.710 --> 01:03:56.710]  That's worthless information.
[01:03:56.710 --> 01:04:00.710]  And there's no, hey, my bad, 100 Biden laptop.
[01:04:00.710 --> 01:04:03.710]  Oh, and by the way, there was a lot of suggestions
[01:04:03.710 --> 01:04:07.710]  that there was probably something more on that laptop than we want to go into.
[01:04:07.710 --> 01:04:09.710]  I mean, when you say laptop from hell.
[01:04:09.710 --> 01:04:10.710]  On the perversion.
[01:04:10.710 --> 01:04:13.710]  Well, I got it from, listen, I got it from the best of the best,
[01:04:13.710 --> 01:04:15.710]  and they said there'll be adrenochrome there.
[01:04:15.710 --> 01:04:19.710]  Oh, and by the way, on the street for all of those of you that don't know this,
[01:04:19.710 --> 01:04:21.710]  but it's called ambrosia.
[01:04:21.710 --> 01:04:23.710]  Ambrosia is a street term?
[01:04:23.710 --> 01:04:24.710]  That's a street term.
[01:04:24.710 --> 01:04:25.710]  Yeah.
[01:04:25.710 --> 01:04:28.710]  Well, the elite term, in your belief, is in the hard drive from hell.
[01:04:28.710 --> 01:04:30.710]  When you get to the bottom of that, you'll also find.
[01:04:30.710 --> 01:04:31.710]  That's all true, by the way.
[01:04:31.710 --> 01:04:34.710]  Perversion, degradation of 100 Biden.
[01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:39.710]  In the grand grimoire, satanic black magic books that I have reviewed and read,
[01:04:39.710 --> 01:04:43.710]  they're at least 800 years old.
[01:04:43.710 --> 01:04:47.710]  They discuss ambrosia, and that's in the Black Sabbath.
[01:04:47.710 --> 01:04:51.710]  When the Black Sabbath usually goes for about two days with about a two-year-old child.
[01:04:52.710 --> 01:04:56.710]  They torture them, and then they then lance them,
[01:04:56.710 --> 01:04:58.710]  and then drink the blood from Lansing.
[01:04:58.710 --> 01:05:03.710]  Infowarsstore.com is like a grocery store or like a vitamin shop.
[01:05:03.710 --> 01:05:05.710]  We want to have all the best brands for you.
[01:05:05.710 --> 01:05:07.710]  We want to have a bunch of different choices for you.
[01:05:07.710 --> 01:05:10.710]  So I get constant questions online and in person.
[01:05:10.710 --> 01:05:11.710]  Hey, what's better, knockout?
[01:05:11.710 --> 01:05:13.710]  What's better, down and out?
[01:05:13.710 --> 01:05:14.710]  What's better?
[01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:16.710]  Why do you sell two or three different sleep aids?
[01:05:16.710 --> 01:05:19.710]  And the answer is different herbal formulas,
[01:05:19.710 --> 01:05:22.710]  different compounds are better for different people.
[01:05:22.710 --> 01:05:26.710]  So one person might like this coffee, another person likes that coffee.
[01:05:26.710 --> 01:05:27.710]  That's how our bodies work.
[01:05:27.710 --> 01:05:29.710]  They're all very diverse.
[01:05:29.710 --> 01:05:32.710]  But we've been able to private label a national bestseller
[01:05:32.710 --> 01:05:34.710]  that's been sold for many years that people love

[01:06:02.710 --> 01:06:07.710]  Defending the republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:06:07.710 --> 01:06:09.710]  It's Alex Jones.
[01:06:10.710 --> 01:06:15.710]  I wanted to welcome all the different viewers and listeners today
[01:06:15.710 --> 01:06:17.710]  who are tuning in from Revival.com
[01:06:17.710 --> 01:06:20.710]  and from all the different satellite networks
[01:06:20.710 --> 01:06:24.710]  that are picking up this broadcast, Dish, DirecTV,
[01:06:24.710 --> 01:06:28.710]  international satellites into Africa, into Europe, into Asia
[01:06:28.710 --> 01:06:33.710]  with the great Revival kingpin when it comes to battling the devil
[01:06:33.710 --> 01:06:36.710]  at point-blank range, the great Pastor Rodney Howard Brown
[01:06:36.710 --> 01:06:38.710]  Revival.com.
[01:06:38.710 --> 01:06:40.710]  And I'm here in Tampa, Florida at his headquarters.
[01:06:40.710 --> 01:06:43.710]  He's got churches all over the world and missionaries all over the world
[01:06:43.710 --> 01:06:45.710]  in Tampa, Florida at the river.
[01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:50.710]  And I will be here for the Sunday morning event,
[01:06:50.710 --> 01:06:53.710]  the big event, the church service.
[01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:59.710]  And then I am going to be here at 7 o'clock at night
[01:06:59.710 --> 01:07:03.710]  in their smaller tabernacle, in their smaller church.
[01:07:04.710 --> 01:07:06.710]  Let's see, I think it's 500 or 600, they were saying,
[01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:08.710]  for an evening with Alex Jones.
[01:07:08.710 --> 01:07:10.710]  It's going to be put out on the satellites as well.
[01:07:10.710 --> 01:07:12.710]  That is free of the public.
[01:07:12.710 --> 01:07:14.710]  But don't worry.
[01:07:14.710 --> 01:07:16.710]  If more than 500 people show up to hear me speak,
[01:07:16.710 --> 01:07:20.710]  they will move it into one of the bigger buildings they have just feet away.
[01:07:20.710 --> 01:07:23.710]  And so I would imagine we're not going to be in that small space.
[01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:25.710]  I mean, he usually has, he does, you know,
[01:07:25.710 --> 01:07:27.710]  seven days a week when he's here.
[01:07:27.710 --> 01:07:29.710]  There's other pastors seven days a week.
[01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:32.710]  They have 300, 400, 500 people there just for that.
[01:07:32.710 --> 01:07:35.710]  And he does that seven days a week on top of all the other services.
[01:07:35.710 --> 01:07:40.710]  So I would imagine, I would imagine a couple thousand people show up.
[01:07:40.710 --> 01:07:43.710]  But it's all great, great security, driver on end, plenty of parking.
[01:07:43.710 --> 01:07:46.710]  It's just the River Church in Tampa, Florida.
[01:07:46.710 --> 01:07:48.710]  It's very easy to get here.
[01:07:48.710 --> 01:07:50.710]  Very nice area.
[01:07:50.710 --> 01:07:52.710]  Be sure and come, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:07:52.710 --> 01:07:55.710]  It's going to be an Ask Alex Jones Anything deal.
[01:07:56.710 --> 01:07:58.710]  I think he's going to get up and speak some.
[01:07:58.710 --> 01:08:00.710]  I'll get up and say a few words, speak some.
[01:08:00.710 --> 01:08:02.710]  But what I always enjoy, that's what he likes as well,
[01:08:02.710 --> 01:08:05.710]  is just talking to people.
[01:08:05.710 --> 01:08:07.710]  You notice right now I'm very calm,
[01:08:07.710 --> 01:08:10.710]  talking about the church and Pastor Brown and everything.
[01:08:10.710 --> 01:08:14.710]  But I just in the last 30 minutes couldn't hardly stop talking.
[01:08:14.710 --> 01:08:16.710]  I got very agitated, very excited.
[01:08:16.710 --> 01:08:18.710]  I started sweating even though it's like 68 degrees in here.
[01:08:18.710 --> 01:08:21.710]  Because when I start thinking about all the evidence of child trafficking
[01:08:22.710 --> 01:08:25.710]  and human sacrificing and mass murder and adrenochrome and death,
[01:08:25.710 --> 01:08:28.710]  and I still see the general public living in denial,
[01:08:28.710 --> 01:08:31.710]  even though the Border Patrol admits that they're helping smuggle children
[01:08:31.710 --> 01:08:33.710]  into the hands of convicted pedophiles.
[01:08:33.710 --> 01:08:35.710]  And many of these children are found dead.
[01:08:35.710 --> 01:08:38.710]  And the children are killed in the hospitals up until the ninth month
[01:08:38.710 --> 01:08:40.710]  and have their body parts sold.
[01:08:40.710 --> 01:08:42.710]  And in many cases, they're kept alive.
[01:08:42.710 --> 01:08:44.710]  That gets me upset.
[01:08:44.710 --> 01:08:46.710]  That gets me angry.
[01:08:46.710 --> 01:08:49.710]  And then we see all of the horrible child trafficking
[01:08:50.710 --> 01:08:53.710]  and child raping stories getting swept under the rug.
[01:08:53.710 --> 01:08:56.710]  And all over the country, I interviewed some of the top pedophile trackers.
[01:08:56.710 --> 01:08:59.710]  I just interviewed Alex Rosen a few days ago.
[01:08:59.710 --> 01:09:02.710]  But on Monday, he talked about how he went to Washington State
[01:09:02.710 --> 01:09:04.710]  with good cops that were there.
[01:09:04.710 --> 01:09:06.710]  They had the guys trying to get kids,
[01:09:06.710 --> 01:09:09.710]  coming to have sex with little kids,
[01:09:09.710 --> 01:09:11.710]  and saying they wanted to have sex with kids.
[01:09:11.710 --> 01:09:13.710]  And these pedophiles will be honest.
[01:09:13.710 --> 01:09:15.710]  Yes, I want to have sex with kids.
[01:09:15.710 --> 01:09:17.710]  I came to have sex with a five-year-old.
[01:09:17.710 --> 01:09:19.710]  And the D.A. says to Soros,
[01:09:19.710 --> 01:09:21.710]  you will not arrest that person.
[01:09:21.710 --> 01:09:24.710]  So the D.A.s are now protecting the pedophiles.
[01:09:24.710 --> 01:09:27.710]  But let me just give you some examples of good news that's happening.
[01:09:27.710 --> 01:09:29.710]  The U.K. a week ago said,
[01:09:29.710 --> 01:09:31.710]  okay, we're not doing transgender surgeries,
[01:09:31.710 --> 01:09:34.710]  and we're banning the use of privity blockers
[01:09:34.710 --> 01:09:36.710]  on anybody below the age of 17.
[01:09:36.710 --> 01:09:38.710]  Because you're an adult.
[01:09:38.710 --> 01:09:40.710]  I don't agree with it, but if you want to destroy yourself,
[01:09:40.710 --> 01:09:42.710]  that's your issue.
[01:09:42.710 --> 01:09:45.710]  I guess you can find a plastic surgeon that will cut your genitals off.
[01:09:45.710 --> 01:09:47.710]  I mean, I think it probably should be illegal,
[01:09:47.710 --> 01:09:49.710]  because you're mentally ill, but whatever.
[01:09:49.710 --> 01:09:51.710]  But obviously, with children or young people, it should be illegal.
[01:09:51.710 --> 01:09:53.710]  And children can't make that decision.
[01:09:53.710 --> 01:09:56.710]  So they know the backlash is so big now,
[01:09:56.710 --> 01:09:58.710]  and they know that there's enough victims,
[01:09:58.710 --> 01:10:00.710]  millions of them, that have had their genitals cut off.
[01:10:00.710 --> 01:10:02.710]  Little girls have had their breasts cut off.
[01:10:02.710 --> 01:10:05.710]  Some doctors go forward and cut out their uterus and ovaries.
[01:10:05.710 --> 01:10:07.710]  With the boys, I don't want to get into it here,
[01:10:07.710 --> 01:10:09.710]  but listeners, you need to understand.
[01:10:09.710 --> 01:10:11.710]  Hundreds of thousands of boys in the U.S. alone,
[01:10:11.710 --> 01:10:13.710]  and it's accelerating.
[01:10:13.710 --> 01:10:15.710]  First it was 100 a year, then it was 1,000 a year,
[01:10:15.710 --> 01:10:17.710]  and now it's 100,000 a year or so,
[01:10:17.710 --> 01:10:19.710]  have their genitals cut off,
[01:10:19.710 --> 01:10:21.710]  and then they create an artificial female organ
[01:10:21.710 --> 01:10:23.710]  that isn't real, that's an open wound.
[01:10:23.710 --> 01:10:25.710]  And for decades, it never heals.
[01:10:25.710 --> 01:10:27.710]  You have to wear it.
[01:10:27.670 --> 01:10:33.670]  A horrible prosthesis up in you to keep the open channel, the bleeding channel open.
[01:10:33.670 --> 01:10:35.670]  Now, with girls, it's even worse.
[01:10:35.670 --> 01:10:36.670]  And let's show some photos of this.
[01:10:36.670 --> 01:10:38.670]  I didn't tell the crew to do it, but you can pull it up.
[01:10:38.670 --> 01:10:39.670]  It has a medical term.
[01:10:39.670 --> 01:10:45.670]  I believe it's called a penoscopy, meaning from pen, I guess in Latin.
[01:10:45.670 --> 01:10:49.670]  And they take the forearms off the girls and part of their legs.
[01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:53.670]  I mean, if you're going to do the cruel joke of building an artificial male member that doesn't work,
[01:10:53.670 --> 01:10:57.670]  you might as well just make it tiny so you're not having to chop up too much.
[01:10:57.670 --> 01:11:00.670]  But they, for some reason, want to make just these huge things.
[01:11:00.670 --> 01:11:07.670]  And it is a big, giant, bleeding thing that almost always falls off in a few months.
[01:11:07.670 --> 01:11:11.670]  And they put a plastic piece of PVC pipe in it as the urethra.
[01:11:11.670 --> 01:11:13.670]  So I'm sorry to have to talk about this here on air, folks.
[01:11:13.670 --> 01:11:16.670]  I know it's horrible, but it's happening to our children.
[01:11:16.670 --> 01:11:17.670]  It's going on.
[01:11:17.670 --> 01:11:22.670]  So the good news is the U.K. banned it, and I predicted last week that the E.U. would follow
[01:11:22.670 --> 01:11:23.670]  because I've noticed how this works.
[01:11:23.670 --> 01:11:27.670]  The E.U. has already banned the shots for children a year and a half ago, saying they didn't work and hurt them,
[01:11:27.670 --> 01:11:28.670]  and heart attacks.
[01:11:28.670 --> 01:11:32.670]  J&J, AstraZeneca, Moderna, Pfizer, all banned.
[01:11:32.670 --> 01:11:37.670]  For those that get mad at Pastor Brown three years ago saying I'm not taking the shot, don't trust him.
[01:11:37.670 --> 01:11:40.670]  For those, guys, show the actual surgery photos, though.
[01:11:40.670 --> 01:11:44.670]  Don't show the actual surgery photos.
[01:11:44.670 --> 01:11:47.670]  Don't show what they build with it.
[01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:50.670]  We're not going to show even an artificial male member here.
[01:11:50.670 --> 01:11:54.670]  Just show after the surgery the cut open thighs, the cut open legs, okay?
[01:11:54.670 --> 01:11:57.670]  I'm not making any of this up, folks, okay?
[01:11:57.670 --> 01:12:02.670]  Type in how female-to-male transgender surgery happens.
[01:12:02.670 --> 01:12:04.670]  You can type in open heart surgery.
[01:12:04.670 --> 01:12:05.670]  You can type in artificial heart.
[01:12:05.670 --> 01:12:07.670]  You can type in brain surgery.
[01:12:07.670 --> 01:12:09.670]  You can type in leg surgery.
[01:12:09.670 --> 01:12:13.670]  You can type in spine replacement, hip replacement, and it's all on YouTube.
[01:12:13.670 --> 01:12:19.670]  You can type in female-to-male and male-to-female, which isn't really female-to-male.
[01:12:19.670 --> 01:12:20.670]  It's a lie.
[01:12:20.670 --> 01:12:24.670]  You can say you're a penguin and have them, you know, it's like the South Park where he says he's a dolphin,
[01:12:24.670 --> 01:12:25.670]  but he's not a dolphin.
[01:12:25.670 --> 01:12:29.670]  He has a big, horrible, stinking, fake fin on his back.
[01:12:29.670 --> 01:12:33.670]  You can say that all you want, but you're not really that, okay?
[01:12:33.670 --> 01:12:41.670]  And so the good news is they have now banned it in the U.K., and now they're moving to ban it in Europe,
[01:12:41.670 --> 01:12:45.670]  and hopefully we can get our souls back and ban this here in the United States.
[01:12:45.670 --> 01:12:52.670]  But it's only as people discover how gruesome this is and how horrible this is that people are learning this.
[01:12:52.670 --> 01:12:59.670]  This is it.
[01:12:59.670 --> 01:13:00.670]  I mean, this is surgery, folks.
[01:13:00.670 --> 01:13:01.670]  This is on YouTube.
[01:13:01.670 --> 01:13:03.670]  This is what they do.
[01:13:03.670 --> 01:13:04.670]  That's enough.
[01:13:04.670 --> 01:13:05.670]  Just turn it off.
[01:13:05.670 --> 01:13:07.670]  And, again, it never heals.
[01:13:07.670 --> 01:13:08.670]  It doesn't have real skin on it.
[01:13:08.670 --> 01:13:10.670]  This is so insane.
[01:13:10.670 --> 01:13:12.670]  Okay, just, oh, my goodness.
[01:13:13.670 --> 01:13:17.670]  I'm not going to apologize for showing that, but, you know, we can show you what an abortion looks like, too.
[01:13:17.670 --> 01:13:22.670]  And I've gone and stood outside abortion clinics, you know, and back in the day with big posters, you know, to show it,
[01:13:22.670 --> 01:13:26.670]  and then later with TV screens, and the left comes over and physically attacks us.
[01:13:26.670 --> 01:13:27.670]  And we're not disrespecting the babies.
[01:13:27.670 --> 01:13:28.670]  We're respecting them.
[01:13:28.670 --> 01:13:32.670]  Just like Jesus was crucified in public and God used that against the enemy.
[01:13:32.670 --> 01:13:36.670]  I mean, I do think everybody should go watch an abortion, and you can see them.
[01:13:36.670 --> 01:13:39.670]  I think you should go look at it for yourself.
[01:13:39.670 --> 01:13:40.670]  You should see all this.
[01:13:40.670 --> 01:13:41.670]  But I can't handle it today.
[01:13:41.670 --> 01:13:42.670]  I've seen it enough.
[01:13:42.670 --> 01:13:43.670]  I'm not going to subject.
[01:13:43.670 --> 01:13:46.670]  This is not ensemble cast on Rodney Howard Brown's thing right now.
[01:13:46.670 --> 01:13:51.670]  So I don't know if they want that.
[01:13:51.670 --> 01:13:53.670]  So in deference to his audience, I'm not going to show it.
[01:13:53.670 --> 01:13:55.670]  In fact, that's enough of all of it.
[01:13:55.670 --> 01:13:57.670]  I can't handle much more of this.
[01:13:57.670 --> 01:14:01.670]  Europe does about face on transgender therapy for children and are moving to ban it,
[01:14:01.670 --> 01:14:05.670]  saying it looks like it's causing suicides, it doesn't work, and doesn't help the children.
[01:14:05.670 --> 01:14:09.670]  Because the lie was, oh, cut their breasts off, cut their genitals off, cut their uterus out.
[01:14:09.670 --> 01:14:11.670]  It's going to make them so happy.
[01:14:11.670 --> 01:14:15.670]  And, of course, the lawsuits are all getting filed as people find out how horrible this all is.
[01:14:15.670 --> 01:14:17.670]  So, yes, this is what's happening.
[01:14:17.670 --> 01:14:19.670]  Now, that's the good news.
[01:14:19.670 --> 01:14:20.670]  Here is some of the other news.
[01:14:20.670 --> 01:14:22.670]  And we're going to go to break here in a moment.
[01:14:22.670 --> 01:14:30.670]  Report, four children found in Boston run housing with drag queens, drugs, sex toys, and a dead body.
[01:14:30.670 --> 01:14:32.670]  And we'll get into that report.
[01:14:32.670 --> 01:14:34.670]  And the thing is this is being swept under the rug.
[01:14:34.670 --> 01:14:36.670]  That's a Breitbart article.
[01:14:36.670 --> 01:14:38.670]  And it's not even in the local news.
[01:14:38.670 --> 01:14:42.670]  It's in the fire department report and the police report.
[01:14:42.670 --> 01:14:44.670]  And, of course, nobody is being investigated.
[01:14:44.670 --> 01:14:45.670]  Nobody cares.
[01:14:45.670 --> 01:14:52.670]  Drugs, dead body, children held captive in a closet as young as five years old, no big deal.
[01:14:52.670 --> 01:14:54.670]  Because it's a drag queen.
[01:14:54.670 --> 01:14:55.670]  Oh, that's the best thing on earth.
[01:14:55.670 --> 01:15:01.670]  No, a drag queen is Bob Hope joking around at the USO dressed up like a woman making a joke out of it.
[01:15:01.670 --> 01:15:03.670]  I don't think everybody that dresses up like a woman as a joke is bad.
[01:15:03.670 --> 01:15:05.670]  I did it once in a comedy skit.
[01:15:05.670 --> 01:15:07.670]  It was ridiculous with a wig on my head saying I was Wonder Woman.
[01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:09.670]  I identify as a woman as a joke.
[01:15:09.670 --> 01:15:11.670]  That's making a joke out of it.
[01:15:11.670 --> 01:15:15.670]  When Steven Crowder goes to a gym and says, you know, he's a woman, the point is it's obscene.
[01:15:15.670 --> 01:15:21.670]  But when you go and try to perform in front of children, have them put money in your G-string and shake your butt in children's face,
[01:15:21.670 --> 01:15:24.670]  it's the sexualization of children, and it should be illegal.
[01:15:24.670 --> 01:15:29.670]  And that is exactly what it is in spades.
[01:15:29.670 --> 01:15:31.670]  So we'll go to Breit, come back and talk about that.
[01:15:31.670 --> 01:15:36.670]  Deranged transgender activists suspected of mailing letters containing white-powdered GOP leaders.
[01:15:36.670 --> 01:15:39.670]  They're also the ones doing bomb threats against Target and everybody else.
[01:15:39.670 --> 01:15:41.670]  But then saying that it's us.
[01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:44.670]  AP said it's right-wingers, even though the police say it's transgenders.
[01:15:44.670 --> 01:15:47.670]  Also, we've got more on this.
[01:15:47.670 --> 01:15:49.670]  We've got more on McCarthy warns GOP.
[01:15:49.670 --> 01:15:52.670]  Now is not the time to force impeachment on Biden.
[01:15:52.670 --> 01:15:54.670]  I'll give you my take on that.
[01:15:54.670 --> 01:15:57.670]  We've also got a lot of military news.
[01:15:57.670 --> 01:16:03.670]  Two amazing nootropics, that means brain power, are back in stock at InfoWarsTour.com.

[01:18:15.670 --> 01:18:20.670]  They're allowing us to private label it at a lower price you'll find in stores.
[01:18:20.670 --> 01:18:24.670]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[01:18:24.670 --> 01:18:32.670]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and to also make your nerves healthier,
[01:18:32.670 --> 01:18:37.670]  which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive to pain.
[01:18:37.670 --> 01:18:39.670]  There's major research behind this all.
[01:18:39.670 --> 01:18:49.670]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from InfoWarsMD and Nerve Renew from InfoWarsMD exclusively at InfoWarsTour.com right now.

[01:18:58.670 --> 01:19:01.670]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and the War for the World,
[01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:06.670]  is a historic book that documents the globals in their own words planned for our future.
[01:19:06.670 --> 01:19:07.670]  That is a hellish future.
[01:19:07.670 --> 01:19:11.670]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[01:19:11.670 --> 01:19:17.670]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World at bookstores, Amazon, or InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:19:17.670 --> 01:19:23.670]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies we got run out.
[01:19:23.670 --> 01:19:25.670]  And there's about 1,000 left of them right now.
[01:19:25.670 --> 01:19:31.670]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy, at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:19:31.670 --> 01:19:35.670]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[01:19:35.670 --> 01:19:38.670]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[01:19:38.670 --> 01:19:41.670]  You'll also know that you help keep InfoWars on the air.
[01:19:41.670 --> 01:19:45.670]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[01:19:45.670 --> 01:19:50.670]  I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to InfoWarsTour.com and get a signed copy
[01:19:50.670 --> 01:19:55.670]  and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate them to the library or give them to the local school.
[01:19:55.670 --> 01:19:58.670]  This is an InfoWar. I'm counting on you, and thank you for your support.
[01:20:00.670 --> 01:20:06.670]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[01:20:08.310 --> 01:20:21.430]  Welcome back to the Alex Jones Show, coming to you from the River Church, Rodney Howard
[01:20:21.430 --> 01:20:28.110]  Brown in the outskirts of beautiful Tampa, Florida, where I'll be hosting again tomorrow
[01:20:28.110 --> 01:20:29.110]  from the studios.
[01:20:29.110 --> 01:20:34.710]  And then I'll also be here Sunday evening for an evening with Alex Jones, and it's free
[01:20:34.710 --> 01:20:35.710]  and open to the public.
[01:20:35.710 --> 01:20:40.230]  And up to 10,000 people can come, but they're putting us in the smaller auditorium and
[01:20:40.230 --> 01:20:42.190]  then expanding it as needed.
[01:20:42.190 --> 01:20:43.190]  So it's unlimited.
[01:20:43.190 --> 01:20:44.610]  You're not going to get turned away.
[01:20:44.610 --> 01:20:50.110]  I don't think 10,000 would come, the biggest event I ever had had 6,000 at it.
[01:20:50.110 --> 01:20:52.830]  And that was a paid event because we had to rent a hotel in Los Angeles.
[01:20:52.830 --> 01:20:56.430]  It was a 9-11 truth event, exposing what really happened there.
[01:20:56.430 --> 01:20:57.430]  So please come.
[01:20:57.430 --> 01:21:01.150]  I think it's going to be quite the evening, and we'll just take questions.
[01:21:01.150 --> 01:21:06.750]  And as long as you want to ask Alex Jones anything, Howard's going to give a speech,
[01:21:06.750 --> 01:21:07.750]  Rodney Howard Brown.
[01:21:07.750 --> 01:21:13.150]  I'm going to give a speech and a little talk, and then we'll take hours of your questions.
[01:21:13.150 --> 01:21:14.150]  And it's easy to find.
[01:21:14.150 --> 01:21:17.150]  Just the River in Tampa, Florida, riverchurchrevival.com.
[01:21:17.150 --> 01:21:21.630]  Okay, let me do this.
[01:21:21.630 --> 01:21:25.430]  I don't just sit there and rattle on about January 6th, because most people know it was
[01:21:25.430 --> 01:21:30.430]  a stage provocateur event, and that rehabs were just the tip of the spear.
[01:21:30.430 --> 01:21:33.350]  And our listeners know that, and they don't want to just hear the same thing they already
[01:21:33.350 --> 01:21:35.470]  know over and over again.
[01:21:35.470 --> 01:21:37.550]  But let me just say this right now.
[01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:40.510]  There have been major new developments that affect every one of you out there, including
[01:21:40.510 --> 01:21:44.150]  myself, and is a big deal.
[01:21:44.150 --> 01:21:52.310]  And so when we talk about January 6th, and we talk about issues like this, it is important
[01:21:52.310 --> 01:21:59.310]  to understand that this is their blueprint to brand the American people as terrorists,
[01:21:59.310 --> 01:22:00.910]  period.
[01:22:00.910 --> 01:22:02.070]  And that they've officially done that.
[01:22:02.070 --> 01:22:04.950]  And I told you two and a half years ago when Biden first got in, that's what he was doing
[01:22:04.950 --> 01:22:08.470]  because he directed the National Security Council and the Justice Department that the
[01:22:08.470 --> 01:22:13.250]  main threat was white supremacist, and that the definition of white supremacist was anyone
[01:22:13.250 --> 01:22:16.790]  questioning lockdowns, forced shots, open borders, anybody that wanted to keep their
[01:22:16.790 --> 01:22:20.790]  churches open, anybody that they've added on to it that was against the, or didn't like
[01:22:20.790 --> 01:22:22.590]  how the Afghan withdrawal happened.
[01:22:22.590 --> 01:22:27.550]  I mean, if you oppose transgenderism, critical race theory, you're a white supremacist.
[01:22:27.550 --> 01:22:30.950]  If you oppose telling six-year-olds that they're inherently bad because they're white, which
[01:22:30.950 --> 01:22:35.750]  is totally racist and bad, telling little black kids they're bad because of what color
[01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:38.830]  they are, it's all the same evil, then you're a white supremacist.
[01:22:38.830 --> 01:22:42.390]  And that's how they then define this, and they just put the document from June of that
[01:22:42.390 --> 01:22:43.390]  year.
[01:22:43.390 --> 01:22:47.630]  He first makes the announcement when he gets into office via fraud, and then, oh, also
[01:22:47.630 --> 01:22:51.470]  questioning elections is white supremacist, I forgot that too.
[01:22:51.470 --> 01:22:59.350]  And then by that definition, they've now expanded it to the number one threat is populist, is
[01:22:59.350 --> 01:23:01.470]  anybody that questions this takeover.
[01:23:01.470 --> 01:23:05.790]  And so I knew when the Congress subpoenaed me with the January 6th Puppet Committee
[01:23:05.790 --> 01:23:13.310]  that didn't have any real Republicans on it, and Kinzinger and Cheney was it.
[01:23:13.310 --> 01:23:16.510]  And I knew when I testified to them that they were trying to set me up, so I took the fifth.
[01:23:16.910 --> 01:23:20.670]  I had nothing to hide, but Schiff had already doctored three documents, he's being censured
[01:23:20.670 --> 01:23:23.370]  for it right now, and he was on that committee.
[01:23:23.370 --> 01:23:25.230]  And I mean, I had the guy interrogating me.
[01:23:25.230 --> 01:23:28.510]  I mean, I testified before these guys and I took the fifth 98 times.
[01:23:28.510 --> 01:23:32.470]  And I said, because you're not a real committee and you're criminals that wanna upset me up
[01:23:32.470 --> 01:23:36.630]  and I told them with their face, then I said, because you're criminals I take the fifth.
[01:23:36.630 --> 01:23:39.250]  Because you're criminals I take the fifth, because you're criminals I take the fifth,
[01:23:39.250 --> 01:23:40.250]  because you're criminals I take the fifth.
[01:23:40.250 --> 01:23:42.470]  And ask your question, because you're criminals I take the fifth, because you're criminals
[01:23:42.470 --> 01:23:46.090]  I take the fifth, because you are the criminals I take the fifth, I'm not gonna sit there
[01:23:46.090 --> 01:23:53.310]  and put up with it. And so I knew that they subpoenaed a bunch of people that
[01:23:53.310 --> 01:23:56.750]  worked with me, a bunch of people around me. I knew the questions they were asking
[01:23:56.750 --> 01:24:01.590]  him. I knew what was going on. And they wanted to say that Trump and I got with
[01:24:01.590 --> 01:24:06.990]  Roger Stone and planned to attack the Capitol. That totally made us look bad.
[01:24:06.990 --> 01:24:11.350]  That was a setup that we never did before, never did since, that storming a
[01:24:11.350 --> 01:24:16.570]  Capitol and pooping on Nancy Pelosi's chair. I mean, seriously, oh, that's
[01:24:16.570 --> 01:24:20.490]  our plan. Yeah, we're into paramilitary stuff too. We're into
[01:24:20.490 --> 01:24:25.310]  war, folks. That's what we do is we overthrow governments. When I say
[01:24:25.310 --> 01:24:30.190]  1776, I mean the spirit of 1776 and the fight for the hearts and minds and souls
[01:24:30.190 --> 01:24:36.190]  of the people. It's why it's called an info war. Information war is 90% of war.
[01:24:36.190 --> 01:24:42.030]  I'm at war with lies. I'm at war with corruption. But no, the military is not my
[01:24:42.030 --> 01:24:45.710]  department and leading paramilitary counteroffensives to the globalist coup
[01:24:45.710 --> 01:24:49.590]  is not my department. And it's not because I don't have courage, I don't have
[01:24:49.590 --> 01:24:52.990]  skin in the game. They're trying to put me in prison because I threaten them with
[01:24:52.990 --> 01:24:57.630]  the truth. And I expose their works of darkness. And I give people hope. And I
[01:24:57.630 --> 01:25:02.670]  rally against them. And I expose them. So I knew that they've had a whole bunch of
[01:25:02.670 --> 01:25:06.790]  grand juries open. And I never on air talked about because lawyers advised me
[01:25:06.790 --> 01:25:13.270]  to, to get into some of the grand juries that I've had to give testimony to. And
[01:25:13.510 --> 01:25:21.310]  some of the written testimony through affidavits. It costs incredible amounts
[01:25:21.310 --> 01:25:24.510]  of money. I hired you know, some of the best criminal lawyers in the country. I'm
[01:25:24.510 --> 01:25:29.150]  not gonna say their names. And it has been a lot of fun. Let me tell you. And
[01:25:30.150 --> 01:25:34.590]  not just on January 6, they have been. And see, they win regardless, because
[01:25:34.670 --> 01:25:37.350]  they've weaponized the Justice Department. And if they do this to me,
[01:25:37.350 --> 01:25:42.710]  and I've got to spend millions of dollars, millions of dollars, because a
[01:25:42.710 --> 01:25:45.590]  good criminal lawyer, and they actually, they don't just believe you, they go
[01:25:45.590 --> 01:25:48.830]  through all your computers, all your stuff, interview everybody. And then they
[01:25:48.830 --> 01:25:53.790]  go before the grand jury and say, this is absolute crap. My this person is
[01:25:53.790 --> 01:25:57.710]  totally innocent. While the while the prosecutors go, no, he's the devil and
[01:25:57.710 --> 01:26:02.030]  show no proof. And folks on Owen Schroer, they put federal filings and
[01:26:02.030 --> 01:26:05.230]  saying he stormed the Capitol and was telling people to attack it. And the
[01:26:05.230 --> 01:26:10.270]  judges don't care. They love it in DC select judges. And so I was like, Whoa,
[01:26:10.310 --> 01:26:13.030]  they've indicted. Oh, and when he was with me, try to get people to go in the
[01:26:13.030 --> 01:26:17.110]  building. We'll show you that video coming up next segment. He's in DC. Now
[01:26:17.110 --> 01:26:20.190]  he just landed. He's going to court tomorrow. Again, and this is the final
[01:26:20.190 --> 01:26:22.790]  hearing whether whether they're going to go full out charge him or drop it or
[01:26:22.790 --> 01:26:25.910]  whatever, we're gonna find out. But he's been saying I'm not guilty of this. But
[01:26:25.910 --> 01:26:29.230]  what do I say? I'm guilty of trespassing on the Capitol. I'm explain
[01:26:29.230 --> 01:26:34.910]  what happened there. We had a pavilion there at the Capitol on the northeast
[01:26:34.910 --> 01:26:42.750]  corner. We had all of it with the Capitol Police. But the DC police were
[01:26:42.750 --> 01:26:48.070]  in control, and they helped storm the Capitol and manipulate a few 100 people
[01:26:48.070 --> 01:26:51.390]  to follow him in. And that's why they tried to keep the cameras from coming
[01:26:51.390 --> 01:26:54.550]  out the video from coming out. And now congressman came out two weeks ago and
[01:26:54.550 --> 01:26:57.910]  said, We've seen the footage is being restricted. They say to protect
[01:26:57.910 --> 01:27:01.030]  officers names. That's because it's them in the face hands.
[01:27:02.830 --> 01:27:06.190]  The most of the D. C. Police were wearing face masks, but they got tired
[01:27:06.190 --> 01:27:11.430]  later and pulled them off. And this is all coming out. So it's Ray Epps.
[01:27:11.430 --> 01:27:14.590]  Another group ramming signs saying going the Capitol outside. They
[01:27:14.590 --> 01:27:19.630]  understaffed than the D. C. Police on also some capital police that ran on
[01:27:19.630 --> 01:27:23.950]  it, fired tear gas into their own officers to break the line. Then the
[01:27:23.950 --> 01:27:28.070]  officers helped break the windows and told others to go in, and the rest is
[01:27:28.070 --> 01:27:28.470]  history.
[01:27:29.470 --> 01:27:32.310]  Meanwhile, I'm at the ellipse freezing my butt off because I don't realize how
[01:27:32.310 --> 01:27:36.830]  cold it was that morning. I was wearing a jacket and a T shirt and, you know,
[01:27:36.830 --> 01:27:40.750]  just light socks. I love cold, but not not not, you know, sitting there for
[01:27:40.750 --> 01:27:45.550]  four hours even before Trump spoke. And we now know the timeline that before
[01:27:45.550 --> 01:27:50.750]  Trump, uh, even spoke. That's what I tried to break into the capital. And
[01:27:50.750 --> 01:27:54.550]  then I was told all the Secret Service and the feds. They want you to lead
[01:27:54.550 --> 01:27:57.710]  the march. It's only 40,000 in the ellipse. You gotta go through metal
[01:27:57.710 --> 01:28:00.390]  attackers be around Trump. There's a million people in and around the
[01:28:00.390 --> 01:28:04.630]  Washington Monument. They all start leaving when Trump starts speaking
[01:28:04.750 --> 01:28:07.870]  because Trump was gonna go to the capital and speak at the thing they'd
[01:28:07.870 --> 01:28:11.670]  set up. Trump always just knows where he's going, but just shows up. Trump
[01:28:11.670 --> 01:28:16.190]  didn't know there'd be no police, no Secret Service, no National Guard when
[01:28:16.190 --> 01:28:17.790]  he was gonna go to the Northeast into the capital.
[01:28:18.790 --> 01:28:20.910]  So once the feds know they've breached
[01:28:22.590 --> 01:28:27.750]  the Secret Service comes over with the RNC people, they open the gate
[01:28:27.910 --> 01:28:31.190]  backstage. Trump's up there speaking. I'm right in the second row. Here's
[01:28:31.190 --> 01:28:35.990]  Trump right here. Feds come over. They go, Okay, Jones, it's time. I get up.
[01:28:36.590 --> 01:28:38.910]  My cell phone's not working. There's so many people using cell phones. I
[01:28:38.910 --> 01:28:42.430]  couldn't get a signal. I couldn't check what was happening. I get out, go
[01:28:42.430 --> 01:28:46.110]  behind the ellipse, go back behind. Tell the Secret Service I gotta use the
[01:28:46.110 --> 01:28:48.870]  bathroom, the cops. We go use the bathroom, wait a few minutes. They go,
[01:28:48.870 --> 01:28:52.150]  Hurry, you gotta get to the Capitol for the president. I'm like, I'm supposed
[01:28:52.150 --> 01:28:54.990]  to lead, and I look down at Pennsylvania Avenue from the back, and
[01:28:54.990 --> 01:28:57.750]  there's just tens of thousands of people marching.

[01:30:52.950 --> 01:31:03.950]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWare has had. I don't think anybody can deny it,
[01:31:03.950 --> 01:31:09.070]  and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us. But when we talk
[01:31:09.070 --> 01:31:12.150]  about the crew at InfoWare, it's people behind the scenes, the researchers, the
[01:31:12.150 --> 01:31:18.430]  writers. They really have been the MVPs in this fight. And we look at Harrison
[01:31:18.430 --> 01:31:22.630]  Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six,
[01:31:22.630 --> 01:31:27.310]  seven days a week. It's really just incredible. So for myself, the whole
[01:31:27.310 --> 01:31:31.030]  InfoWare's crew, I thank you for your past support. I only encourage you now to
[01:31:31.030 --> 01:31:36.110]  realize that InfoWare's cannot stay on air if you do not support us. I know you
[01:31:36.110 --> 01:31:38.990]  spread the word. I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful. Keep doing it. But
[01:31:38.990 --> 01:31:43.470]  most viewers and listeners never go to infowarestore.com, and you never buy
[01:31:43.470 --> 01:31:46.950]  great products that enrich and empower your life while at the same time keeping us on
[01:31:46.950 --> 01:31:50.590]  air. I know that less than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at
[01:31:50.590 --> 01:31:54.390]  infowarestore.com. If just 1% more of you took action and went to
[01:31:54.390 --> 01:31:59.790]  infowarestore.com, our funding problems will be over. Please take action now.
[01:32:02.830 --> 01:32:07.470]  I want to say BrainForce is great. I want to say TurboForce is amazing. It is. But
[01:32:07.470 --> 01:32:13.030]  if you took it with fish oil, it's like the fish oil is it. The fish oil's better
[01:32:13.030 --> 01:32:16.110]  than it. And that's an example of what I'm talking about. Fish oil is
[01:32:16.270 --> 01:32:21.710]  liquid energy. Brain, body, heart, the cleanest, the best out there. Krill oils is
[01:32:21.710 --> 01:32:24.950]  the best, and it'll give you the damn burps. And I'm just sorry. You want
[01:32:24.950 --> 01:32:28.510]  something like this, you don't get stuff for free. The krill is hallucinogenic.
[01:32:28.510 --> 01:32:31.430]  It's so good in my view. I'm not making a medical statement here, but let me tell
[01:32:31.430 --> 01:32:35.270]  you something. And I eat five capulets of krill oil before I go to bed. I'm seeing
[01:32:35.270 --> 01:32:42.950]  Santa Claus that night. So your brain is made basically out of what fish oil is.
[01:32:43.910 --> 01:32:48.710]  So we don't make a big profit off of it. But you know, as I just obsess,
[01:32:48.710 --> 01:32:52.350]  because whatever the best is we've got, I just can't lie to you. I just can't do
[01:32:52.350 --> 01:32:52.550]  it.
[01:33:00.390 --> 01:33:06.710]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order. It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:09.200 --> 01:33:26.200]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones.
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:35.200]  Now, folks have to understand if they're new viewers watching on international satellite, direct TV, dish network, you name it,
[01:33:35.200 --> 01:33:41.200]  they normally watch Rodney Howard's 24-hour operations here, Rodney Howard Brown's operations,
[01:33:41.200 --> 01:33:46.200]  that you hear me just churning all this stuff out and all these adventures and all these stories,
[01:33:46.200 --> 01:33:50.200]  and even I'm amazed by it, how much crazy stuff I've been in the middle of fighting the New World Order.
[01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:55.200]  And that's the reason I just get up here and just start rattling because I've seen so much, done so much,
[01:33:55.200 --> 01:33:57.200]  and I'm telling you what I remember exactly as I saw it.
[01:33:57.200 --> 01:34:01.200]  I have this thing where I don't even try to premeditate the stories I'm telling.
[01:34:01.200 --> 01:34:06.200]  I mean, they're all true, but to try to think about each story and how do I want to tell it,
[01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:09.200]  I would just get caught in that and not be able to even tell the story.
[01:34:09.200 --> 01:34:13.200]  So I just have this thing where I just regurgitate what the truth is.
[01:34:13.200 --> 01:34:15.200]  That's why I got arrested for DWI three years ago.
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:17.200]  The cops pulled me over. They said, have you been drinking?
[01:34:17.200 --> 01:34:19.200]  I said, yeah, I had two glasses of sake. Boom.
[01:34:19.200 --> 01:34:21.200]  Everybody said, why didn't you just lie? Just couldn't do it.
[01:34:21.200 --> 01:34:23.200]  Now, I blew under and they dropped it.
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:28.200]  But the point is, is that when you're hearing me, folks, you're getting literal no filter.
[01:34:29.200 --> 01:34:32.200]  And this is the mode I get in of all the studying I've done.
[01:34:32.200 --> 01:34:34.200]  It's a little annoying sometimes even to me.
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:36.200]  Some people think it's great.
[01:34:36.200 --> 01:34:42.200]  The point is, is you're literally getting someone just opening the floodgates and telling you my perception.
[01:34:42.200 --> 01:34:44.200]  Now, we all see through rose-colored darklies.
[01:34:44.200 --> 01:34:49.200]  None of us are perfect, but you're getting as close to the truth as I can tell you exactly what happened.
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:52.200]  And, of course, I should have said this up front as I got into this.
[01:34:52.200 --> 01:34:55.200]  I told you first hour about a lot of it, and I said I'd get back and do it second hour.
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:57.200]  We're doing that now, and I need to hurry because there's a lot to tell.
[01:34:57.200 --> 01:34:59.200]  Why am I getting back to January 6th now?
[01:34:59.200 --> 01:35:03.200]  I just got up to the point where the Secret Service comes and gets us and brings us out
[01:35:03.200 --> 01:35:08.200]  and points me at the Pennsylvania Avenue 100 yards away.
[01:35:08.200 --> 01:35:11.200]  I'm in this big field, and it's just a mass of people already going.
[01:35:11.200 --> 01:35:16.200]  And I go, how would the bullhorn I'm about to go meet my security and get, who's waiting at the fence for me,
[01:35:16.200 --> 01:35:18.200]  how do I control and lead that?
[01:35:18.200 --> 01:35:20.200]  Well, we'll be there, and the president will be there.
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:25.200]  His motorcade, he'll meet you there to speak with Roger.
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:30.200]  This is the White House coordinator people, and I'm sitting there going, okay, all right.
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:34.200]  So I'm not the omnipresent government, which isn't omnipresent.
[01:35:34.200 --> 01:35:36.200]  I don't have helicopters and surveillance cameras.
[01:35:36.200 --> 01:35:37.200]  I'm not in command centers.
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:39.200]  My cell phone's not working.
[01:35:39.200 --> 01:35:43.200]  I'm trying to go find my security people because, again, there's a million people there.
[01:35:43.200 --> 01:35:44.200]  Everybody's on their cell phones.
[01:35:44.200 --> 01:35:46.200]  So you can't get Internet.
[01:35:46.200 --> 01:35:48.200]  It takes like 30 minutes for a page to load.
[01:35:48.200 --> 01:35:49.200]  Most of the time you can't call somebody.
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:52.200]  If it does, it just cuts out real quick.
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:56.200]  So I'm trying to find my security.
[01:35:56.200 --> 01:35:57.200]  I find him.
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:36:03.200]  And then when he gets to the motorcade, and I go, yeah, but we need to get down there and get in place
[01:36:03.200 --> 01:36:06.200]  so when he gets there, find the stage, get with our security.
[01:36:06.200 --> 01:36:08.200]  And we're like, what security do they have?
[01:36:08.200 --> 01:36:11.200]  Well, and our guys are like, well, we were just down there an hour ago to check it out,
[01:36:11.200 --> 01:36:14.200]  and there's no security, and they're fighting with the police.
[01:36:14.200 --> 01:36:16.200]  And I go, excuse me?
[01:36:16.200 --> 01:36:21.200]  Yeah, there's only a few cops, and there's people there attacking them.
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:24.200]  And our security guys go, yeah, this was going on hours ago.
[01:36:24.200 --> 01:36:25.200]  But we tried to call you.
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:26.200]  We couldn't get through to you.
[01:36:26.200 --> 01:36:29.200]  And I'm like, let's get down there.
[01:36:29.200 --> 01:36:31.200]  And our security guys are like, yeah, let's get down there and try to stop it.
[01:36:31.200 --> 01:36:33.200]  We figured it was a few guys.
[01:36:33.200 --> 01:36:35.200]  So we start walking as fast as we can.
[01:36:35.200 --> 01:36:37.200]  It takes about 20, 30 minutes to get down there.
[01:36:37.200 --> 01:36:39.200]  And I walk up to the Capitol grounds.
[01:36:39.200 --> 01:36:40.200]  There's no fences.
[01:36:40.200 --> 01:36:41.200]  There's no nothing.
[01:36:41.200 --> 01:36:44.200]  I'm supposed to go around the back of the Capitol, the northeast side or whatever it was,
[01:36:44.200 --> 01:36:45.200]  the corner back there.
[01:36:45.200 --> 01:36:46.200]  And I walk up this way.
[01:36:46.200 --> 01:36:47.200]  It's around the corner over here.
[01:36:47.200 --> 01:36:51.200]  And I see, like out of a movie, people climbing the front of the Capitol.
[01:36:51.200 --> 01:36:53.200]  I see a guy fall off.
[01:36:53.200 --> 01:36:58.200]  And then a cloud of tear gas comes and hits me, and I start coughing.
[01:36:58.200 --> 01:37:00.200]  And it was just totally surreal.
[01:37:00.200 --> 01:37:02.200]  And I'm sitting there.
[01:37:02.200 --> 01:37:04.200]  So I climb up on a box of chairs.
[01:37:04.200 --> 01:37:06.200]  They're getting ready for the inauguration in a few weeks.
[01:37:06.200 --> 01:37:10.200]  And so they had big plastic pallets, you know, bubble wrap.
[01:37:10.200 --> 01:37:13.200]  It's like sheet wrap around these big stacks of chairs, all stacked.
[01:37:13.200 --> 01:37:16.200]  So we climb up on top of those, and, you know, there's holes in the chairs.
[01:37:16.200 --> 01:37:17.200]  You can fall off.
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:19.200]  And I'm trying to bullhorn.
[01:37:19.200 --> 01:37:21.200]  But when I start saying, hey, it's feds inside.
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:22.200]  They're breaking in.
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:23.200]  It'll be a Kent State massacre.
[01:37:23.200 --> 01:37:24.200]  They're setting you up.
[01:37:24.200 --> 01:37:25.200]  Don't go in.
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:27.200]  I don't even know they've already breached and gone in because I can't see that.
[01:37:27.200 --> 01:37:31.200]  I'm down at the low level on the grounds.
[01:37:31.200 --> 01:37:33.200]  And this is all going on.
[01:37:33.200 --> 01:37:36.200]  So Owen Schreuer is up there with me.
[01:37:36.200 --> 01:37:39.200]  He's been charged with attacking the Capitol, breaching it.
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:43.200]  In the charging order, it says breaching the Capitol.
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:46.200]  And later it says they call that the Capitol grounds.
[01:37:46.200 --> 01:37:48.200]  So we have a permit to be on the Capitol.
[01:37:48.200 --> 01:37:50.200]  We have a permit to give a speech.
[01:37:50.200 --> 01:37:51.200]  He works at InfoWars.
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:37:56.200]  The feds said in his charging, Owen has lied and said he works at InfoWars.
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:37:57.200]  He does not work there.
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:00.200]  He's only worked there seven years now.
[01:38:00.200 --> 01:38:02.200]  At that time, five years.
[01:38:02.200 --> 01:38:04.200]  So he worked there five years.
[01:38:04.200 --> 01:38:06.200]  He anchors The Daily Show.
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:10.200]  He's famous with hundreds of millions of views, viral videos.
[01:38:10.200 --> 01:38:14.200]  Owen, before he got banned off everything like I did, he had more views than I did.
[01:38:14.200 --> 01:38:17.200]  Paul Watson had some videos with 50 million, 60 million, so did Owen.
[01:38:17.200 --> 01:38:19.200]  Matt films that 100 million and stuff.
[01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:22.200]  But the point was, Owen is a well-known guy.
[01:38:22.200 --> 01:38:26.200]  Feds said in the filing, nope, he doesn't work there.
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:27.200]  He's a liar too.
[01:38:27.200 --> 01:38:29.200]  So why did they indict Owen?
[01:38:29.200 --> 01:38:32.200]  And that goes into the new stuff that just broke.
[01:38:32.200 --> 01:38:35.200]  Why did they charge Owen but not me?
[01:38:35.200 --> 01:38:36.200]  It's perception.
[01:38:36.200 --> 01:38:43.200]  Why did they slap Hunter Biden on the wrist and then charge Trump with all this garbage?
[01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:47.200]  Because they got to slap him on the wrist to make it look like they're actually doing something.
[01:38:47.200 --> 01:38:51.200]  And so they knew they couldn't charge me because I got up and tried to stop it.
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:54.200]  Owen did too as well.
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:58.200]  And they knew that if they charged me, I'd make a big deal about the feds and rehabs,
[01:38:58.200 --> 01:39:02.200]  and I wouldn't go quietly into the night even with their kangaroo court and kangaroo jury in D.C.
[01:39:02.200 --> 01:39:04.200]  And I was told that by insiders.
[01:39:04.200 --> 01:39:05.200]  I told you all this before.
[01:39:05.200 --> 01:39:07.200]  Now it's in a 20-page article in The Washington Post.
[01:39:07.200 --> 01:39:09.200]  So now it's all there.
[01:39:09.200 --> 01:39:13.200]  But they wanted the perception that Infowars was still guilty.
[01:39:13.200 --> 01:39:17.200]  So they said, well, we'll just pick off his right-hand guy.
[01:39:17.200 --> 01:39:20.200]  We'll just take down Batman's Robin.
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:23.200]  And so that's what they did.
[01:39:23.200 --> 01:39:29.200]  So it's the same thing with, okay, we really can't indict Hunter with something real because he's the president's kid.
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:31.200]  And he was doing it for his dad, the big guy.
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:32.200]  We can't have that come out in court.
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:34.200]  So let's slap on the wrist for a gun charge.
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:35.200]  And it's the same thing.
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:37.200]  It's not that the feds were on my side.
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:38.200]  They just knew they didn't have any evidence.
[01:39:38.200 --> 01:39:42.200]  They knew I understood things that wouldn't go along with their narrative ignorantly.
[01:39:42.200 --> 01:39:45.200]  And so they said, we'll do the next best thing.
[01:39:45.200 --> 01:39:47.200]  We'll just fry Owen and then give it no media cover.
[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:49.200]  And so that's what they're doing.
[01:39:49.200 --> 01:39:50.200]  That's what's happening.
[01:39:50.200 --> 01:39:55.200]  And we now know out of The Washington Post article, and I know they're being accurate here because I live this,
[01:39:55.200 --> 01:39:58.200]  and I've told you almost all this already, but now it's confirmed,
[01:39:58.200 --> 01:40:05.200]  that two years ago, the head prosecutor in D.C., where they know they've got everything rigged,
[01:40:05.200 --> 01:40:08.200]  went to the Justice Department at the highest levels at a meeting and said,
[01:40:08.200 --> 01:40:13.200]  we want to indict Trump and say that he masterminded it with Roger Stone and Alex Jones.
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:15.200]  I did not discuss January 6th with Trump.
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:17.200]  I did not discuss the march with Trump.
[01:40:17.200 --> 01:40:20.200]  I had no contact with Trump for a year or more before this.
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:22.200]  I missed a few calls from him.
[01:40:22.200 --> 01:40:26.200]  It's always an unknown number, and I don't carry my phone around with you constantly.
[01:40:26.200 --> 01:40:28.200]  I use my voicemail as a secretary.
[01:40:28.200 --> 01:40:32.200]  And so that's why, and that's why when Trump's calling me the times he gets through,
[01:40:32.200 --> 01:40:35.200]  keep your phone in your hand, expect a call in the next 10 minutes.
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:39.200]  And then they call and go, it's the president, secretary here.
[01:40:39.200 --> 01:40:40.200]  Would you like to talk to the president?
[01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:41.200]  Yes.
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:42.200]  And then it transfers to Trump.
[01:40:42.200 --> 01:40:44.200]  So that's how it works when you talk to Trump.
[01:40:44.200 --> 01:40:48.200]  Unless he's at Mar-a-Lago, then Roger will call and he's like, hey, Trump wants to talk to you.
[01:40:48.200 --> 01:40:50.200]  He'll call you in the next five minutes.
[01:40:50.200 --> 01:40:52.200]  That's how it works, okay, because he gets irritated.
[01:40:52.200 --> 01:40:54.200]  I mean, I've missed like probably 20 calls from Trump.
[01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:55.200]  And I'm not name dropping.
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:56.200]  I'm just telling you how this works.
[01:40:56.200 --> 01:41:01.200]  So I've not talked to Trump in over a year before January 6th.
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:06.200]  I was talking to a RNC major fundraiser who did rallies for Trump.
[01:41:06.200 --> 01:41:10.200]  Because remember, the executive branch doesn't pay for Trump's rallies.
[01:41:10.200 --> 01:41:12.200]  That's illegal.
[01:41:12.200 --> 01:41:15.200]  It's the RNC or Trump himself or his donors.
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:16.200]  So I'm talking to this lady.
[01:41:16.200 --> 01:41:17.200]  She's the main lady.
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:18.200]  Her name is all over the news.
[01:41:18.200 --> 01:41:19.200]  She's well-known.
[01:41:20.200 --> 01:41:25.200]  with Trump Jr. and Don and Eric and all them.
[01:41:25.200 --> 01:41:27.200]  And then she comes over and waves me through to go.
[01:41:27.200 --> 01:41:28.200]  And I don't think she was setting me up.
[01:41:28.200 --> 01:41:30.200]  I don't think even the Secret Service guys were setting me up.
[01:41:30.200 --> 01:41:34.200]  But whoever told them, the moles inside that were setting Trump up, we now know,
[01:41:34.200 --> 01:41:40.200]  they were doing this to send me to the Capitol right when all this started to blame me.
[01:41:40.200 --> 01:41:44.200]  But I was smart enough, plus it was idiotic for us to be involved in that.
[01:41:44.200 --> 01:41:45.200]  It makes us look horrible.
[01:41:45.200 --> 01:41:48.200]  I mean, I don't have a motive to go make us look like fools.
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:50.200]  And attack police and stuff.
[01:41:50.200 --> 01:41:52.200]  That's a terrible move.
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:53.200]  We don't have a motive.
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:54.200]  Plus, there's no evidence of it.
[01:41:55.200 --> 01:41:58.200]  And so now it's come out in a big article that's a whitewash.
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:04.200]  It's titled FBI resisted opening probe into Trump's role in January 6 for more than a year.
[01:42:04.200 --> 01:42:09.200]  Now, that's a whitewash 20-page investigative report to just make it look like,
[01:42:09.200 --> 01:42:11.200]  oh, they're being easy on Trump.
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:14.200]  They're not criminally charging him with all this stuff, you know,
[01:42:14.200 --> 01:42:16.200]  because they're out to get him.
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:17.200]  You know, it's just they had to.
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:21.200]  And that's because Jack Smith's getting ready to indict Trump on January 6 stuff.
[01:42:21.200 --> 01:42:24.200]  But the FBI came out and told Reuters right around this time,
[01:42:24.200 --> 01:42:29.200]  there's no evidence Alex Jones or Roger Stone or Trump planned any premeditated stuff on the Capitol.
[01:42:29.200 --> 01:42:30.200]  Well, obviously we didn't.
[01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:31.200]  We walked into a trap.
[01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:36.200]  We thought there'd be Secret Service and state and police and everything like there was everywhere else
[01:42:36.200 --> 01:42:38.200]  when we got to the stage.
[01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:44.200]  But we never got there because the Capitol was attacked by Feds and DC police
[01:42:44.200 --> 01:42:46.200]  attacking the Capitol police.
[01:42:46.200 --> 01:42:48.200]  And that's all come out in Congress now.
[01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:51.200]  And in the videos, pull up the headlines.
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:55.200]  So we walk into this trap and then they have the nerve in D.C.
[01:42:55.200 --> 01:43:01.200]  to try to frame me and Roger and Trump for walking into their trap.
[01:43:02.200 --> 01:43:04.200]  Trump asked for 10,000 National Guard.
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:06.200]  Milley said he resigned, called it tyranny.
[01:43:07.200 --> 01:43:12.200]  Well, January 6, they cut the amount of Capitol police that day to half
[01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:15.200]  and sent them away on traffic duty, helping the D.C. police.
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:19.200]  Meanwhile, the D.C. police came and helped attack the Capitol.
[01:43:19.200 --> 01:43:21.200]  And it's all on record.
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:23.200]  It's all on record.
[01:43:23.200 --> 01:43:25.200]  It's all on record.
[01:43:25.200 --> 01:43:26.200]  It's all. So what do we do?
[01:43:26.200 --> 01:43:28.200]  Jones knows. How do we indict him for this?
[01:43:28.200 --> 01:43:30.200]  But the Feds are so crazy in D.C.
[01:43:30.200 --> 01:43:34.200]  That's a special unit that ran the kidnapping operation in Whitmer that ran January 6.
[01:43:34.200 --> 01:43:35.200]  They're like, we don't care.
[01:43:35.200 --> 01:43:37.200]  We got we got juries that we handpicked.
[01:43:37.200 --> 01:43:39.200]  D.C.'s 95 percent Democrat.
[01:43:39.200 --> 01:43:40.200]  All these people work for us.
[01:43:40.200 --> 01:43:42.200]  Totally rigged juries on record.
[01:43:42.200 --> 01:43:44.200]  It's come out they rigged juries.
[01:43:44.200 --> 01:43:47.200]  We've exposed them in Roger's trial, Roger Stone.
[01:43:47.200 --> 01:43:52.200]  And so they went to Garland.
[01:43:52.200 --> 01:43:55.200]  And it's all in the article and to the top people.
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:58.200]  And they literally said, are you crazy?
[01:43:59.200 --> 01:44:01.200]  That's in the article.
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:03.200]  They said, are you nuts?
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:04.200]  There's zero evidence.
[01:44:04.200 --> 01:44:06.200]  We've got all their phones, subpoenas, the NSA.
[01:44:07.200 --> 01:44:09.200]  Trump did not talk to Roger about this.
[01:44:09.200 --> 01:44:11.200]  Trump did not talk to Alex about this.
[01:44:12.200 --> 01:44:13.200]  They had all Roger's text messages.
[01:44:13.200 --> 01:44:16.200]  They already had them before we were subpoenaed for him.
[01:44:16.200 --> 01:44:18.200]  Roger's like, I don't want to go to D.C.
[01:44:18.200 --> 01:44:20.200]  It's going to be a big, big crowds.
[01:44:20.200 --> 01:44:22.200]  And, you know, Trump rallies are, you know, blah, blah, blah.
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:23.200]  I'm staying here.
[01:44:23.200 --> 01:44:25.200]  I'm like, oh, no, come, please.
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:26.200]  You know, we've got donors.
[01:44:26.200 --> 01:44:27.200]  It'll fly you there.
[01:44:27.200 --> 01:44:29.200]  Well, I don't have money for security.
[01:44:30.200 --> 01:44:32.200]  Roger's a sweetheart, but he is a grumpy.
[01:44:32.200 --> 01:44:34.200]  OK, and he is burnout.
[01:44:34.200 --> 01:44:35.200]  Well, just like I am.
[01:44:35.200 --> 01:44:37.200]  And I had to beg him to go.
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:39.200]  And then that day, he couldn't get out of the Willard Hotel.
[01:44:39.200 --> 01:44:41.200]  There was a million people there in and around that hotel.
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:43.200]  The hotel's right by the Ellipse.
[01:44:43.200 --> 01:44:44.200]  And let me tell you something.
[01:44:44.200 --> 01:44:46.200]  I don't have claustrophobia, but I do after this.
[01:44:46.200 --> 01:44:50.200]  It took us an hour and 30 minutes with 15 huge security guys.
[01:44:50.200 --> 01:44:56.200]  I mean, like some of them, almost 7-foot-tall black off-duty cops, OK, from Maryland and D.C.
[01:44:57.200 --> 01:45:02.200]  And it made our listeners mad because, I mean, we had to shove a lot of people out of the way to get there.
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:06.200]  So we formed like an icebreaker with these security guys, 15 of them.
[01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:10.200]  And had to battle our way through to get to that Ellipse.
[01:45:10.200 --> 01:45:12.200]  OK, so, I mean, that's what that...
[01:45:12.200 --> 01:45:13.200]  And we did a lot...
[01:45:13.200 --> 01:45:15.200]  The video's been put out of that, too.
[01:45:16.200 --> 01:45:18.200]  So we had to shove our way through.
[01:45:18.200 --> 01:45:20.200]  Almost got in fights because you're pushing people through.
[01:45:20.200 --> 01:45:21.200]  And there's a lady in a wheelchair.
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:22.200]  And somebody goes, that's my mom.
[01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:23.200]  What's your problem?
[01:45:23.200 --> 01:45:24.200]  I'm sorry.
[01:45:24.200 --> 01:45:25.200]  I'm sorry.
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:26.200]  Oh, well, it's OK.
[01:45:26.200 --> 01:45:27.200]  We'll let you through.
[01:45:27.200 --> 01:45:28.200]  Be a little more careful.
[01:45:28.200 --> 01:45:29.200]  So Roger's like...
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:30.200]  Roger, right before my phone quit working, he texts.
[01:45:30.200 --> 01:45:31.200]  I'm going to the crowd.
[01:45:31.200 --> 01:45:32.200]  He goes, I'm not going.
[01:45:33.200 --> 01:45:34.200]  I can't get out of the hotel.
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:36.200]  So Roger...
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:39.200]  We're these supermen orchestrating the whole thing.
[01:45:39.200 --> 01:45:40.200]  We can't get out.
[01:45:40.200 --> 01:45:41.200]  He can't get out of the hotel.
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:44.200]  I can barely make it with huge, huge black security guys.
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:46.200]  And that's just mainly who they were.
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:47.200]  Huge black...
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:48.200]  These look like NFL linemen.
[01:45:48.200 --> 01:45:49.200]  I think some of them were.
[01:45:50.200 --> 01:45:52.200]  And literally, we can...
[01:45:53.200 --> 01:45:54.200]  I mean, I'm like being pushed.
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:58.200]  And we're battling like a Roman phalanx or a Greek phalanx to get into this thing.
[01:45:59.200 --> 01:46:00.200]  And then again, they let us out.
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:01.200]  We go down to the Capitol.
[01:46:01.200 --> 01:46:02.200]  All this happens.
[01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:08.200]  And they are literally in here admitting that they went a year ago, over a year ago now,
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:09.200]  and went...
[01:46:09.200 --> 01:46:10.200]  Was it 16 months ago?
[01:46:10.200 --> 01:46:14.200]  They went to the highest level of the Justice Department because they've been told,
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:15.200]  you've presented no evidence.
[01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:18.200]  They had all these big meetings and said, you still presented no evidence.
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:23.200]  And they finally ordered them to not go to the grand jury and have me indicted.
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:25.200]  Because they got grand juries.
[01:46:25.200 --> 01:46:29.200]  Ladies and gentlemen, you could have a one-year-old baby and bring it in front of a D.C. jury
[01:46:29.200 --> 01:46:31.200]  and say, we're going to put this baby in a garbage disposal.
[01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:33.200]  This baby is bad.
[01:46:33.200 --> 01:46:34.200]  And they'd say, kill that baby right now.
[01:46:34.200 --> 01:46:35.200]  I'm serious.
[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:38.200]  I mean, D.C. is completely rigged, 100%.
[01:46:39.200 --> 01:46:40.200]  And that's what Trump's going to be facing.
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:42.200]  You know, Jack Smith first tried to have him tried there.
[01:46:43.200 --> 01:46:46.200]  But the Supreme Court's already ruled, you have to indict somebody where the crime was committed.
[01:46:47.200 --> 01:46:53.200]  Well, they say the crime of the documents it's made up was committed in the jurisdiction of Miami, Florida.
[01:46:54.200 --> 01:46:55.200]  So they've moved that down here.
[01:46:55.200 --> 01:46:58.200]  So that's how dangerous this is, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:46:59.200 --> 01:47:02.200]  And so the reason they want this is to brand us all as terrorists.
[01:47:03.200 --> 01:47:07.200]  But I got to say, the feds, the very unit of feds that all the evidence showed,
[01:47:08.200 --> 01:47:11.200]  led the well-executed operation of setting us up at the Capitol.
[01:47:12.200 --> 01:47:13.200]  I mean, I'll give it to you.
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:14.200]  You did an excellent job.
[01:47:15.200 --> 01:47:16.200]  We barely diffused most of it.
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:19.200]  Because they had a bunch of crazies, we now learn, that really thought they were with Q.
[01:47:20.200 --> 01:47:22.200]  And they were going to go handcuff Pelosi, we now learn in hindsight.
[01:47:22.200 --> 01:47:24.200]  And, you know, there have been more people killed.
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:26.200]  This was horrible for the Capitol Police.
[01:47:27.200 --> 01:47:28.200]  Horrible for the citizens.
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:30.200]  Not good for Congress.
[01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:32.200]  I wish none of it would have happened.
[01:47:33.200 --> 01:47:35.200]  But I don't apologize for it because I didn't order the stand down.
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:37.200]  And I didn't tell people to attack the Capitol.
[01:47:38.200 --> 01:47:41.200]  And people ask, are you scared knowing the feds?
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:43.200]  No, I'm not scared.
[01:47:44.200 --> 01:47:45.200]  I mean, I'm concerned about nuclear war with Russia.
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:47.200]  I'm concerned about the dollar dying.
[01:47:48.200 --> 01:47:49.200]  I'm concerned about all the crime and brainwashing.
[01:47:50.200 --> 01:47:51.200]  I mean, no, I'm a man standing up against evil.
[01:47:52.200 --> 01:47:57.200]  But what's so frustrating here is that you read this 20 page article.
[01:47:58.200 --> 01:47:59.200]  And you read the names of the prosecutors, the head prosecutor.
[01:48:00.200 --> 01:48:01.200]  The head prosecutor got mad.
[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:03.200]  And it's the head prosecutor.
[01:48:04.200 --> 01:48:05.200]  It looks like leaking this to the press.
[01:48:06.200 --> 01:48:07.200]  Of course, that's illegal too.
[01:48:08.200 --> 01:48:10.200]  But, oh, they're allowed to do that, right?
[01:48:11.200 --> 01:48:14.200]  But I'm not sure he, I mean, this is just, this is insane.
[01:48:15.200 --> 01:48:16.200]  They know 100% I'm innocent.
[01:48:17.200 --> 01:48:18.200]  They know Trump's innocent.
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:21.200]  They know Roger Stone had nothing to do with any of this.
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:23.200]  Bystander.
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:25.200]  I mean, Roger had nothing to do with the planning.
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:27.200]  Nothing.
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:31.200]  I was asked by the Republicans to pay for the ellipse.
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:34.200]  Because there's these rumors that I got $100,000.
[01:48:35.200 --> 01:48:36.200]  And I didn't.
[01:48:37.200 --> 01:48:38.200]  I had a couple million dollars then.
[01:48:39.200 --> 01:48:40.200]  But I put $500,000 in.
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:42.200]  And then that wasn't enough.
[01:48:43.200 --> 01:48:45.200]  Trump obviously wanted jumbo screens and all the rest of the stuff there.
[01:48:46.200 --> 01:48:47.200]  And offense, they go, it'll be $2 million.
[01:48:48.200 --> 01:48:49.200]  Can you pay that?
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:51.200]  I said, I can't.
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:53.200]  And, you know, will you organize it?
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:55.200]  And I said, no.
[01:48:56.200 --> 01:48:58.200]  And so they went and got a big, famous event organizer to organize it.
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:00.200]  And I handed the football off.
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:02.200]  But see, that wasn't enough.
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:05.200]  We still want you to be in charge to set me up.
[01:49:06.200 --> 01:49:07.200]  To set me up.
[01:49:08.200 --> 01:49:09.200]  To set me up.
[01:49:10.200 --> 01:49:11.200]  Folks, I don't plan parties at my house.
[01:49:12.200 --> 01:49:13.200]  I don't have birthday parties.
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:15.200]  I don't like planning parties.
[01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:17.200]  I don't like planning events.
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:19.200]  I'm not involved in it.
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:20.200]  That's my checkbook.
[01:49:21.200 --> 01:49:22.200]  So, again, I'm not here like, I'm innocent to all the leftists.
[01:49:23.200 --> 01:49:24.200]  The feds know.
[01:49:25.200 --> 01:49:26.200]  I don't organize jack squat.
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:28.200]  Okay?
[01:49:29.200 --> 01:49:30.200]  And they all know that.
[01:49:31.200 --> 01:49:32.200]  And they know they organized it.
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:34.200]  And they know I know how they organized it.
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:36.200]  And so that's why they didn't indict me.
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:39.200]  So instead they have been harassing the living snot.
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:42.200]  You know how much the charges against Owen have cost so far?
[01:49:43.200 --> 01:49:44.200]  Just last week I asked him.
[01:49:45.200 --> 01:49:46.200]  $300,000.
[01:49:47.200 --> 01:49:48.200]  $300,000.
[01:49:49.200 --> 01:49:52.200]  And he's had to spend fighting the charge of attacking the Capitol.
[01:49:53.200 --> 01:49:55.200]  And encouraging people to attack the Capitol.
[01:49:56.200 --> 01:49:57.200]  And, of course, there's no video.
[01:49:58.200 --> 01:49:59.200]  There's no witnesses.
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:01.200]  There's no nothing.
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:03.200]  I'm going to play some video for you now of what really happened.
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:05.200]  But first, Pastor Rodney Howard Brown is coming in here for an incredible Next Hour.
[01:50:06.200 --> 01:50:07.200]  Live, uncensored, unfiltered.

[01:50:15.200 --> 01:50:16.200]  Share it.

[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:20.200]  It hasn't been unplugged one time yet.
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:24.200]  And so I really, really, really need funding.
[01:50:25.200 --> 01:50:29.200]  I'm not like George Soros, you know, that hands out, gets all this money to people.
[01:50:30.200 --> 01:50:31.200]  I don't get globalist money.
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:33.200]  I don't get all this big money.
[01:50:34.200 --> 01:50:35.200]  I sell products at Infowars.com.
[01:50:36.200 --> 01:50:37.200]  That's how we fund our operation.
[01:50:38.200 --> 01:50:39.200]  And we need to build our own independent media.
[01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:41.200]  We've been doing it at the tip of the spear.
[01:50:42.200 --> 01:50:43.200]  We have a lot of great products.
[01:50:44.200 --> 01:50:45.200]  We have a big sale that ends this weekend at Infowars.com.
[01:50:46.200 --> 01:50:47.200]  We've got fluoride-free, all-natural tooth whitening toothpaste.

[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:50.200]  All-natural turmeric toothpaste with tea tree oil and more.
[01:50:51.200 --> 01:50:52.200]  My dad's a retired dentist and oral surgeon.
[01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:54.200]  He developed them all.
[01:50:55.200 --> 01:50:58.200]  We've got amazing, super high-quality Nitric Boost that has all these key healthy compounds
[01:50:59.200 --> 01:51:01.200]  that heart surgeons and other experts have recommended.
[01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:03.200]  With all the stuff happening to the blood right now,

[01:51:18.200 --> 01:51:19.200]  that I left in the hotel that I forgot to bring.
[01:51:20.200 --> 01:51:23.200]  It is The Great Reset and the War for the World,

[01:51:27.200 --> 01:51:29.200]  Mark of the Beast, how this is all going to be fulfilled,
[01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:32.200]  but how God's people, through God, and of course Christ, defeated.
[01:51:33.200 --> 01:51:34.200]  It is such an important book to understand,
[01:51:35.200 --> 01:51:36.200]  the New World Order Master Plan, the Great Reset,
[01:51:37.200 --> 01:51:38.200]  the War for the World.
[01:51:39.200 --> 01:51:40.200]  You can get signed or unsigned copies.
[01:51:41.200 --> 01:51:42.200]  The signed copy is a fundraiser book.
[01:51:42.200 --> 01:51:43.200]  There's only about 400 of those left.
[01:51:44.200 --> 01:51:46.200]  That's why it's $99.95 to fund our operation.
[01:51:47.200 --> 01:51:48.200]  The regular book's $20.
[01:51:49.200 --> 01:51:50.200]  And it's a hardcover.
[01:51:51.200 --> 01:51:52.200]  But no more signed books after these are gone.
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:54.200]  We've already put out over 20,000 signed books.
[01:51:55.200 --> 01:51:57.200]  And that all went to keep Infowars on the air
[01:51:58.200 --> 01:51:59.200]  and fight these battles.
[01:52:00.200 --> 01:52:01.200]  That raised millions of dollars.
[01:52:02.200 --> 01:52:03.200]  Thank you, listeners.
[01:52:04.200 --> 01:52:06.200]  And I donated it all to the fight to keep our network on air.
[01:52:07.200 --> 01:52:08.200]  But now, I am out of money in my bankruptcy.
[01:52:09.200 --> 01:52:10.200]  I am now taking some of the sales
[01:52:10.200 --> 01:52:12.200]  and a small part of it to fund myself and my defense.
[01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:15.200]  And that's all public in my personal bankruptcy.
[01:52:16.200 --> 01:52:17.200]  They go, oh, Jones has paid $1.5 million a year
[01:52:18.200 --> 01:52:19.200]  under his bankruptcy deal.
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:21.200]  Yeah, the other side agreed to that
[01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:23.200]  because my lawyer bills are $1.5 million a year personally.
[01:52:24.200 --> 01:52:25.200]  It's a big joke.
[01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:27.200]  Oh, but don't worry.
[01:52:28.200 --> 01:52:29.200]  That's how it works.
[01:52:30.200 --> 01:52:31.200]  My lawyers can get the money to pay themselves.
[01:52:32.200 --> 01:52:33.200]  They're good people.
[01:52:34.200 --> 01:52:35.200]  But the point is, that's how this ridiculousness works.
[01:52:36.200 --> 01:52:37.200]  It takes money to fight these wars,
[01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:39.200]  ladies and gentlemen.
[01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:42.200]  So, Infowarsstore.com, Infowarsstore.com,
[01:52:43.200 --> 01:52:47.200]  or 888-253-3139.
[01:52:48.200 --> 01:52:49.200]  Now, the first compilation I want to play
[01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:51.200]  is not the raw video.
[01:52:52.200 --> 01:52:53.200]  I'm going to show you raw video shot by somebody
[01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:55.200]  with an iPhone of me saying,
[01:52:56.200 --> 01:52:57.200]  don't go in the building, stop, as it was all happening
[01:52:58.200 --> 01:52:59.200]  and getting thousands that could hear me to not do it.
[01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:01.200]  But my bullhorn only went about 100 yards.
[01:53:02.200 --> 01:53:03.200]  It didn't get to the whole crowd, obviously.
[01:53:04.200 --> 01:53:05.200]  And then we're going to come back from break
[01:53:06.200 --> 01:53:07.200]  and I'm going to air the raw footage.
[01:53:08.200 --> 01:53:09.200]  You know what?
[01:53:10.200 --> 01:53:11.200]  Let's flip that.
[01:53:12.200 --> 01:53:13.200]  Let's do the short clip now
[01:53:14.200 --> 01:53:15.200]  because we're about to go to break.
[01:53:16.200 --> 01:53:17.200]  And then before Rodney Howard Brown comes in,
[01:53:18.200 --> 01:53:19.200]  it'll fill the next segment.
[01:53:20.200 --> 01:53:21.200]  Let's come in.
[01:53:21.200 --> 01:53:22.200]  If you want to fight, you better believe you got one.
[01:53:23.200 --> 01:53:24.200]  And then the four and a half minute clip
[01:53:25.200 --> 01:53:26.200]  from Alex's war that shows some more context.
[01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:28.200]  It's an award-winning documentary that came out last year
[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:30.200]  that deals with all this.
[01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:32.200]  So, let's play the short, unedited, on the ground,
[01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:34.200]  raw footage of me trying to stop folks
[01:53:35.200 --> 01:53:36.200]  going into the Capitol.
[01:53:37.200 --> 01:53:38.200]  And then we'll go to break
[01:53:38.200 --> 01:53:39.200]  and we will play the four and a half minute
[01:53:40.200 --> 01:53:41.200]  from Alex's war film.
[01:53:42.200 --> 01:53:43.200]  But please go to infowarestore.com.
[01:53:44.200 --> 01:53:45.200]  Please go to infowarestore.com.
[01:53:46.200 --> 01:53:47.200]  We've got books, we've got films,
[01:53:48.200 --> 01:53:49.200]  we've got so much more.
[01:53:50.200 --> 01:53:51.200]  And that is how we're funding our operation.
[01:53:52.200 --> 01:53:53.200]  And we've been having bigger success than ever,
[01:53:54.200 --> 01:53:55.200]  reaching hearts and minds and people waking up
[01:53:56.200 --> 01:53:57.200]  and people saying Alex Jones was right
[01:53:58.200 --> 01:53:59.200]  all over the internet, trending on Twitter
[01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:01.200]  on a routine basis.
[01:54:02.200 --> 01:54:03.200]  But I've been put up against the wall.
[01:54:04.200 --> 01:54:05.200]  I've been maxed out.
[01:54:06.200 --> 01:54:07.200]  I've been pushed all the way.
[01:54:08.200 --> 01:54:09.200]  It is that funding that keeps us on air.
[01:54:10.200 --> 01:54:11.200]  So, I want to thank you all for your support.
[01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:13.200]  Infowarestore.com.
[01:54:14.200 --> 01:54:15.200]  You can also go to infowarestore.com
[01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:17.200]  and make a straight donation.
[01:54:18.200 --> 01:54:19.200]  It's right at the top of infowarestore.com.
[01:54:20.200 --> 01:54:21.200]  It says donate.
[01:54:22.200 --> 01:54:23.200]  Make a $5, $10, $100.
[01:54:24.200 --> 01:54:25.200]  You can sign up for a recurring donation,
[01:54:26.200 --> 01:54:27.200]  canceling time for free.
[01:54:28.200 --> 01:54:29.200]  But without you, we cannot fund the operation.
[01:54:30.200 --> 01:54:31.200]  And they used to have donate right up at the top.
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:33.200]  Why in the world?
[01:54:34.200 --> 01:54:35.200]  It says, health and wellness, preparedness,
[01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:37.200]  media, specials, gear.
[01:54:38.200 --> 01:54:39.200]  By the way, I had that saying donate before.
[01:54:40.200 --> 01:54:41.200]  Can we put that back up?
[01:54:42.200 --> 01:54:43.200]  Stuff's always changing.
[01:54:44.200 --> 01:54:45.200]  Can you put Infowarestore back up for me?
[01:54:46.200 --> 01:54:47.200]  And right there at the top of the page,
[01:54:48.200 --> 01:54:49.200]  yes, they can.
[01:54:50.200 --> 01:54:51.200]  Right there at the top of the page,
[01:54:52.200 --> 01:54:53.200]  it says support us.
[01:54:54.200 --> 01:54:55.200]  You click on that support us button
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:57.200]  and now it says donate.
[01:54:58.200 --> 01:54:59.200]  That was really weird.
[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:01.200]  I guess on the front page,
[01:55:02.200 --> 01:55:03.200]  it says support us
[01:55:04.200 --> 01:55:05.200]  and on the sub-page, it says donate.
[01:55:06.200 --> 01:55:07.200]  Well, let's get that fixed.
[01:55:08.200 --> 01:55:09.200]  Infowarestore.com.
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:11.200]  I thank you all for your support.
[01:55:12.200 --> 01:55:13.200]  So here's the guy who had a permit
[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:15.200]  to be at the Capitol for our event
[01:55:16.200 --> 01:55:17.200]  that Trump was coming to
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:19.200]  trying to stop people going in
[01:55:20.200 --> 01:55:21.200]  who the Justice Department now admits
[01:55:22.200 --> 01:55:23.200]  they've been trying to indict
[01:55:24.200 --> 01:55:25.200]  for two and a half years.
[01:55:26.200 --> 01:55:27.200]  Here's the clip.
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:29.200]  USA! USA! USA! USA!
[01:55:30.200 --> 01:55:31.200]  USA! USA! USA!
[01:55:32.200 --> 01:55:33.200]  USA! USA! USA!
[01:55:34.200 --> 01:55:35.200]  USA! USA! USA!
[01:55:35.200 --> 01:55:36.200]  USA! USA! USA!
[01:55:37.200 --> 01:55:38.200]  USA! USA! USA!
[01:55:39.200 --> 01:55:40.200]  Listen to me.
[01:55:41.200 --> 01:55:42.200]  Listen to me.
[01:55:43.200 --> 01:55:44.200]  We've got a permit on the other side.
[01:55:45.200 --> 01:55:46.200]  It's great that this happened,
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:48.200]  but Trump's not going to come
[01:55:49.200 --> 01:55:50.200]  when we've taken this over.
[01:55:51.200 --> 01:55:52.200]  We're not in your room.
[01:55:53.200 --> 01:55:54.200]  You're amazing.
[01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:56.200]  I love you.
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:55:58.200]  Let's march around to the other side
[01:55:59.200 --> 01:56:00.200]  and let's not fight the police
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:02.200]  and give the system what they want.
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:04.200]  We are peaceful.
[01:56:05.200 --> 01:56:06.200]  And as much as I love
[01:56:07.200 --> 01:56:08.200]  seeing the Trump flags
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:10.200]  flying over this,
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:12.200]  we need to not
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:14.200]  have the confrontation
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:16.200]  with the police.
[01:56:17.200 --> 01:56:18.200]  They're going to make that the story.
[01:56:19.200 --> 01:56:20.200]  I'm going to march to the other side
[01:56:21.200 --> 01:56:22.200]  where we have a stage
[01:56:23.200 --> 01:56:24.200]  where we can speak
[01:56:25.200 --> 01:56:26.200]  and occupy peacefully.
[01:56:27.200 --> 01:56:28.200]  Tell everybody behind you,
[01:56:29.200 --> 01:56:30.200]  march to the other side.
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:32.200]  March to the other side.
[01:56:33.200 --> 01:56:34.200]  You guys are great.
[01:56:35.200 --> 01:56:36.200]  But the police
[01:56:37.200 --> 01:56:39.200]  provocateurs have caused a problem
[01:56:40.200 --> 01:56:41.200]  and the police are throwing flashbangs.
[01:56:42.200 --> 01:56:43.200]  Hit pause, guys.
[01:56:44.200 --> 01:56:45.200]  All right, hit pause.
[01:56:46.200 --> 01:56:47.200]  I want TV viewers to look.
[01:56:48.200 --> 01:56:49.200]  You see the security guy right there.
[01:56:50.200 --> 01:56:51.200]  That's Joey DeLazio, an Army veteran.
[01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:54.200]  You see a Republican strategist,
[01:56:55.200 --> 01:56:56.200]  Ali Alexander.
[01:56:57.200 --> 01:56:58.200]  And then you see Owen Schroer
[01:56:59.200 --> 01:57:00.200]  standing right there.
[01:57:01.200 --> 01:57:02.200]  That man has been indicted.
[01:57:03.200 --> 01:57:04.200]  That man is facing years in jail
[01:57:04.300 --> 01:57:11.300]  Now, you just think about that long and hard.
[01:57:11.360 --> 01:57:19.360]  And again, they credit us for getting, then I went to the Capitol Police, I said, this
[01:57:19.360 --> 01:57:20.360]  is on video.
[01:57:20.360 --> 01:57:24.719]  I said, you've got to get, use your PA system, I know is here, it's super loud, to say, leave
[01:57:24.719 --> 01:57:26.480]  the Capitol, this is unlawful assembly.
[01:57:26.480 --> 01:57:27.480]  That's what police would do anywhere.
[01:57:27.480 --> 01:57:28.480]  It's standard procedure.
[01:57:28.480 --> 01:57:30.839]  They said, they went and talked to the superiors, they said, we're not doing that.
[01:57:30.839 --> 01:57:35.280]  We now know from correctional testimony that the feds, they had the Capitol Police would
[01:57:35.280 --> 01:57:37.960]  not respond to them and give them orders.
[01:57:37.960 --> 01:57:42.040]  But by that nighttime, they had blaring speakers that were there saying, it is illegal to be
[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:43.040]  in the area.
[01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:50.440]  An unlawful assembly has been declared, get out of the area, leave the area.
[01:57:50.440 --> 01:57:56.360]  Two of our bestselling nootropics or brain boosters are now back in stock at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:57:56.360 --> 01:58:00.920]  And for a limited time, they're 50% off when you get them together or 40% off when you get
[01:58:00.920 --> 01:58:01.920]  them individually.
[01:58:01.920 --> 01:58:06.160]  Brain Force Plus and Brain Force Ultra, two separate formulas.
[01:58:06.160 --> 01:58:09.160]  They both give you good, clean energy without the crash.
[01:58:09.160 --> 01:58:14.759]  One is a four to six hour good base of clean energy, again, with no hangover or letdown.
[01:58:14.759 --> 01:58:19.280]  And the other is a very special proprietary formula, that's Brain Force Ultra, that hits
[01:58:19.280 --> 01:58:20.280]  really, really quick.
[01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:21.280]  And I love it.
[01:58:21.280 --> 01:58:22.280]  It wears off in two to three hours.
[01:58:22.280 --> 01:58:24.920]  So if I've got to work at night, but don't want to stay up all night, I can take it and
[01:58:24.920 --> 01:58:28.320]  say nine o'clock at night, got to stay up till midnight working, doing a radio interview
[01:58:28.320 --> 01:58:33.519]  or something, and boom, writing an article or writing a book, and then I get two, three
[01:58:33.519 --> 01:58:35.639]  hours of energy and then go right to bed after it.
[01:58:35.639 --> 01:58:40.920]  Brain Force Ultra, Brain Force Plus, both 50% off by themselves or 40% off individually.
[01:58:40.920 --> 01:58:42.320]  A lot of people love these products.
[01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:43.320]  They've got five star reviews.
[01:58:43.320 --> 01:58:48.599]  But if you haven't tried them, you really should, 50% off, InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:58:48.599 --> 01:58:52.960]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:58.160]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at InfoWarsTore.com.
[01:58:58.160 --> 01:59:03.320]  They are both clones of national bestselling products from a major pharmaceutical slash
[01:59:03.320 --> 01:59:08.120]  supplement maker that are Lister's and Patriot's that are allowing us to private label it at
[01:59:08.120 --> 01:59:10.519]  a lower price you'll find in stores.
[01:59:10.519 --> 01:59:14.639]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[01:59:14.639 --> 01:59:20.759]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and to also make your
[01:59:20.759 --> 01:59:25.839]  nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more
[01:59:25.839 --> 01:59:27.559]  inductive to pain.
[01:59:27.559 --> 01:59:29.839]  There's major research behind this all.

[01:59:59.839 --> 02:00:16.960]  InfoWars, tomorrow's news today.
[02:00:29.839 --> 02:00:37.839]  Ladies and gentlemen, this is such a historic moment together.
[02:00:37.839 --> 02:00:42.839]  This is such a historic moment as America awakens to the new order.
[02:00:42.839 --> 02:00:50.839]  It is an incredible honor and an incredible pleasure to get to meet and see so many amazing
[02:00:50.839 --> 02:00:54.839]  human souls, so many great Americans.
[02:00:55.839 --> 02:00:56.839]  Let's go!
[02:00:56.839 --> 02:00:57.839]  USA!
[02:00:57.839 --> 02:00:58.839]  USA!
[02:00:58.839 --> 02:00:59.839]  USA!
[02:00:59.839 --> 02:01:00.839]  USA!
[02:01:00.839 --> 02:01:01.839]  USA!
[02:01:01.839 --> 02:01:08.839]  Nobody planned this, but Trump's actually getting his inauguration on January 6, 2021
[02:01:08.839 --> 02:01:09.839]  right now, folks.
[02:01:09.839 --> 02:01:11.839]  They've really screwed the pooch on this.
[02:01:11.839 --> 02:01:13.839]  We're going all out peacefully.
[02:01:13.839 --> 02:01:14.839]  We have the facts on our side.
[02:01:14.839 --> 02:01:15.839]  We don't want any violence.
[02:01:15.839 --> 02:01:16.839]  We decry violence.
[02:01:16.839 --> 02:01:17.839]  We're not BLM.
[02:01:17.839 --> 02:01:18.839]  We're not anti-vote.
[02:01:18.839 --> 02:01:23.839]  We're here to let the system know that we know we had our votes stolen and we can put
[02:01:23.839 --> 02:01:27.840]  millions in the streets when Biden can't even fill six circles in his little coven meetings.
[02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:31.840]  All right, I need everybody out of the way because I got to try to get this crowd off
[02:01:31.840 --> 02:01:33.840]  there because they're trying to provocateur so Trump won't come.
[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:35.840]  Easy, watch the tree, watch the people sitting down.
[02:01:35.840 --> 02:01:37.840]  You're on the other side of the train.
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:38.840]  Right.
[02:01:38.840 --> 02:01:45.840]  A lot of instigators up front trying to get us to fight the cops.
[02:01:45.840 --> 02:01:47.840]  It looks real right now.
[02:01:47.840 --> 02:01:49.840]  Lady cops got hit.
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:51.840]  Lady cops got hit in the beginning.
[02:01:51.840 --> 02:01:54.840]  There's bad optics up front.
[02:02:21.840 --> 02:02:26.840]  Hey, listen to me!
[02:02:26.840 --> 02:02:29.840]  Listen to me!
[02:02:33.840 --> 02:02:35.840]  Hey, USA!
[02:02:35.840 --> 02:02:36.840]  USA!
[02:02:36.840 --> 02:02:37.840]  USA!
[02:02:37.840 --> 02:02:38.840]  USA!
[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:39.840]  USA!
[02:02:39.840 --> 02:02:40.840]  USA!
[02:02:40.840 --> 02:02:41.840]  USA!
[02:02:41.840 --> 02:02:42.840]  USA!
[02:02:42.840 --> 02:02:43.840]  USA!
[02:02:43.840 --> 02:02:44.840]  USA!
[02:02:44.840 --> 02:02:45.840]  USA!
[02:02:45.840 --> 02:02:46.840]  USA!
[02:02:46.840 --> 02:02:47.840]  USA!
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:48.840]  USA!
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:49.840]  USA!
[02:02:49.840 --> 02:02:50.840]  USA!
[02:02:50.840 --> 02:02:57.840]  Listen to me, listen to me, we've got a permit on the other side, it's great that this happened,
[02:02:57.840 --> 02:03:04.840]  but the Trump's not going to come when we've taken this over, we're not Antifa, we're not
[02:03:04.840 --> 02:03:10.840]  the O.R.M., you're amazing, I love you, let's march around to the other side and let's not
[02:03:10.840 --> 02:03:14.840]  fight the police and give the system what they want.
[02:03:14.840 --> 02:03:22.840]  We are peaceful, we won this election, and as much as I love seeing the Trump flags flying
[02:03:22.840 --> 02:03:29.840]  over this, we need to not have the confrontation with the police, they're going to make that
[02:03:29.840 --> 02:03:30.840]  the story.
[02:03:30.840 --> 02:03:36.840]  I'm going to march to the other side where we have a stage where we can speak and occupy
[02:03:36.840 --> 02:03:45.840]  peacefully, tell everybody behind you, march to the other side, march to the other side.
[02:03:45.840 --> 02:03:52.840]  You guys are better, you guys are great, but the police, the provocateurs have caused the
[02:03:52.840 --> 02:03:58.840]  problem, and the police are throwing flashbangs, we don't want to have a kid staying here.
[02:03:58.840 --> 02:04:05.840]  So, I love you, we're saving the republic, this is beautiful, but please tell everyone
[02:04:05.840 --> 02:04:08.840]  you know, march to the other side.
[02:04:08.840 --> 02:04:12.840]  Please start to make a path for us back there.
[02:04:12.840 --> 02:04:17.840]  We're going to march, Trump, Trump is going to speak over here.
[02:04:17.840 --> 02:04:21.840]  Trump is coming, Trump is coming on the other side.
[02:04:21.840 --> 02:04:26.840]  So march with us, go slow, go slow, come on then.
[02:04:26.840 --> 02:04:32.840]  And you, tell people behind you, come off the stage.
[02:04:32.840 --> 02:04:35.840]  We're not stealing tanks from the Democrats, man.
[02:04:35.840 --> 02:04:37.840]  You've got a great job.
[02:04:37.840 --> 02:04:39.840]  Come on off of there.
[02:04:39.840 --> 02:04:43.840]  Let's peacefully kill the U.S.A.
[02:04:44.840 --> 02:04:50.840]  Everybody, you've done a great job, but we need to get on the steps.
[02:04:51.840 --> 02:04:54.840]  It was a total nightmare, one of the worst days of my life.
[02:04:54.840 --> 02:04:57.840]  An absolute disaster for us trying to show our...
[02:04:57.840 --> 02:05:01.840]  A lot of people have asked me, why has InfoWars stored at InfoWars Live,
[02:05:01.840 --> 02:05:03.840]  not at a probiotic for more than three years?
[02:05:03.840 --> 02:05:07.840]  The answer is simple, we only bring you the highest quality to lowest prices.
[02:05:07.840 --> 02:05:12.840]  We had a top maker, top certified of probiotics for more than seven years.
[02:05:12.840 --> 02:05:14.840]  They got bought by a libtard company and said,
[02:05:14.840 --> 02:05:17.840]  we're not doing business with you, Mr. Jones, anymore.
[02:05:17.840 --> 02:05:23.840]  Finally, we got a probiotic just as good or better with a top lab that loves our show.
[02:05:23.840 --> 02:05:27.840]  We're able to private label it under InfoWars MD as our probiotic formula.

[02:05:53.840 --> 02:05:54.840]  Transcription by CastingWords
[02:06:23.840 --> 02:06:25.840]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:06:53.840 --> 02:06:55.840]  It's Alex Jones.
[02:07:24.840 --> 02:07:28.840]  This is a titrated dose, reverse psychological warfare operation
[02:07:28.840 --> 02:07:32.840]  using adapt and overcome subversion paradigm manipulation.
[02:07:32.840 --> 02:07:36.840]  In layman's terms, they are manipulating the fact that we adapt to being oppressed.
[02:07:36.840 --> 02:07:40.840]  We adapt to being oppressed with the low dosages of oppression.
[02:07:40.840 --> 02:07:43.840]  Now, when the megaton hits us of the total takeover,
[02:07:43.840 --> 02:07:47.840]  we try to adapt to the poison infusion instead of not knowing.
[02:07:47.840 --> 02:07:50.840]  It's a lethal dose if we accept the dose.
[02:07:50.840 --> 02:07:53.840]  Total Internet of Things, integration, global social score,
[02:07:53.840 --> 02:07:55.840]  complete command and control system.
[02:07:55.840 --> 02:08:00.840]  It is the virtual reality AI weapon system now attacking the United States
[02:08:00.840 --> 02:08:02.840]  with traitors inside the major security agencies,
[02:08:02.840 --> 02:08:04.840]  blocking Trump's resistance of the program
[02:08:04.840 --> 02:08:07.840]  and attempting to stop us from removing the tentacles
[02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:11.840]  of the Chai Com slash big tech banking combine emergency situation.
[02:08:11.840 --> 02:08:14.840]  I have been chosen for destruction because I brought you this information
[02:08:14.840 --> 02:08:17.840]  and have been battering, ramming it out as much as I can.
[02:08:18.840 --> 02:08:22.840]  They want to double use me as they always do in any complex system
[02:08:22.840 --> 02:08:27.840]  of mathematical deception where every angle of my good is turned against us.
[02:08:27.840 --> 02:08:29.840]  So they take what I've said, being sincere,
[02:08:29.840 --> 02:08:32.840]  build me into an insincere person in the straw man.
[02:08:32.840 --> 02:08:35.840]  I'm a person that cares about life and children and is against these wars.
[02:08:35.840 --> 02:08:37.840]  And so they make me a herder of children.
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:41.840]  And then they build me into this lie to then set the distraction
[02:08:41.840 --> 02:08:45.840]  while they're actually censoring all of you to make a debate about Alex Jones.
[02:08:45.840 --> 02:08:49.840]  So even if I didn't sell out to them, they now use me as an archetype
[02:08:49.840 --> 02:08:52.840]  to serve them by being the main distraction.
[02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:56.840]  I have now been captured by the enemy in the information warfare fulcrum
[02:08:56.840 --> 02:08:58.840]  as being used against you.
[02:08:58.840 --> 02:09:03.840]  Only your full understanding of this key will break you free from this paradigm.
[02:09:03.840 --> 02:09:06.840]  I have given you the transmission. Now break free.
[02:09:09.840 --> 02:09:12.840]  I have sworn upon the altar of God
[02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:18.840]  eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[02:09:18.840 --> 02:09:20.840]  Thomas Jefferson.
[02:09:21.840 --> 02:09:25.840]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:09:29.840 --> 02:09:34.840]  A couple hours ago, I was informed by my attorney
[02:09:34.840 --> 02:09:40.840]  that there is a warrant out for my arrest with allegations involving January 6th.
[02:09:40.840 --> 02:09:45.840]  I will have to turn myself in Monday morning.
[02:09:45.840 --> 02:09:50.840]  The DOJ, the Biden administration, announced it's charging a host at Infowars,
[02:09:50.840 --> 02:09:54.840]  a man called Owen Schroer, with several federal crimes,
[02:09:54.840 --> 02:09:57.840]  including, quote, entering a restricted area on January 6th.
[02:09:57.840 --> 02:09:59.840]  Well, that sounds bad. What did Owen Schroer do?
[02:09:59.840 --> 02:10:02.840]  He didn't go inside the Capitol building on January 6th.
[02:10:02.840 --> 02:10:05.840]  He stood on the Capitol steps with hundreds of other people.
[02:10:05.840 --> 02:10:09.840]  Enrique Tarrio pleaded guilty to two misdemeanor charges,
[02:10:09.840 --> 02:10:12.840]  including the burning of a Black Lives Matter banner.
[02:10:12.840 --> 02:10:14.840]  As for those text messages,
[02:10:14.840 --> 02:10:17.840]  the January 6th committee is now planning to subpoena them
[02:10:17.840 --> 02:10:20.840]  as it looks into Jones' role in the Capitol attack.
[02:10:22.840 --> 02:10:24.840]  The American people are not buying the whole fraud
[02:10:24.840 --> 02:10:26.840]  that January 6th was the new Pearl Harbor,
[02:10:26.840 --> 02:10:30.840]  worse than 9-11, all these preposterous assigned things that were set in time.
[02:10:30.840 --> 02:10:32.840]  January 6th was a false flag.
[02:10:32.840 --> 02:10:35.840]  Everybody knows it at this point, from Ray Epps to the pipe bomber.
[02:10:35.840 --> 02:10:37.840]  I mean, it's obvious. It's all coming out.
[02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:39.840]  It's all being exposed.
[02:10:41.840 --> 02:10:43.840]  We're not going to be the ones on trial anymore.
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:45.840]  No, globalists, we're coming after you.
[02:10:45.840 --> 02:10:48.840]  Nuremberg 2.0 begins now.
[02:10:48.840 --> 02:10:50.840]  Wolverines!
[02:11:02.840 --> 02:11:04.840]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[02:11:04.840 --> 02:11:08.840]  I am in the amazing studios of an incredible individual,
[02:11:08.840 --> 02:11:10.840]  Pastor Rodney Howard Brown.
[02:11:10.840 --> 02:11:12.840]  I have known this guy for over 15 years,
[02:11:12.840 --> 02:11:14.840]  known him personally for about 10 or so,
[02:11:14.840 --> 02:11:16.840]  and have been a big follower of his work.
[02:11:16.840 --> 02:11:19.840]  He's my preacher, and I just love the work he does
[02:11:19.840 --> 02:11:22.840]  and the lives he changes in the hundreds of churches
[02:11:22.840 --> 02:11:24.840]  that he's established across the world,
[02:11:24.840 --> 02:11:26.840]  some where he's the only benefactor ever
[02:11:26.840 --> 02:11:28.840]  through his great ministry and his great supporters.
[02:11:28.840 --> 02:11:30.840]  His complex is so incredible.
[02:11:30.840 --> 02:11:32.840]  What I love about it is it's not like a megachurch
[02:11:32.840 --> 02:11:34.840]  that's only open two or three days a week.
[02:11:34.840 --> 02:11:36.840]  I mean, I've been here since Tuesday,
[02:11:36.840 --> 02:11:38.840]  and it's 10 o'clock at night,
[02:11:38.840 --> 02:11:40.840]  7 o'clock in the morning.
[02:11:40.840 --> 02:11:42.840]  There's just prayer meetings and TV programs
[02:11:42.840 --> 02:11:44.840]  and people just everywhere and missionaries going off
[02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:47.840]  and preachers coming in and just ministering.
[02:11:47.840 --> 02:11:50.840]  It's so powerful here at the River Church in Tampa.
[02:11:50.840 --> 02:11:52.840]  And, folks, you need to come from all over.
[02:11:52.840 --> 02:11:54.840]  He just made the announcement.
[02:11:54.840 --> 02:11:56.840]  He just told me about it last night.
[02:11:56.840 --> 02:11:58.840]  He wants me to come Sunday.
[02:11:58.840 --> 02:12:00.840]  Obviously, the main service starts at 9.30,
[02:12:00.840 --> 02:12:02.840]  a big area for 10,000 if they need it out there.
[02:12:02.840 --> 02:12:04.840]  Sometimes they get that.
[02:12:04.840 --> 02:12:06.840]  Then they have another great area.
[02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:08.840]  It's about 3,000 inside.
[02:12:08.840 --> 02:12:10.840]  It's amazing.
[02:12:10.840 --> 02:12:12.840]  And another smaller one for about 500.
[02:12:12.840 --> 02:12:14.840]  He's got me Sunday night set up there
[02:12:14.840 --> 02:12:16.840]  for an evening with Alex at the River Church in Tampa.
[02:12:16.840 --> 02:12:18.840]  It's free, great security, plenty of parking.
[02:12:18.840 --> 02:12:20.840]  You've got to see this complex.
[02:12:20.840 --> 02:12:22.840]  If you're as far away as Louisiana,
[02:12:22.840 --> 02:12:24.840]  you should, or Mississippi or Georgia,
[02:12:24.840 --> 02:12:26.840]  you should, or Alabama or anywhere in Florida,
[02:12:26.840 --> 02:12:28.840]  there's no excuses.
[02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:30.840]  We're four hours away by car from Miami,
[02:12:30.840 --> 02:12:32.840]  an hour by flight.
[02:12:32.840 --> 02:12:34.840]  Everybody should really come see this church.
[02:12:34.840 --> 02:12:36.840]  But regardless, it'll be online at Revival.com
[02:12:36.840 --> 02:12:38.840]  and on the satellite and other systems
[02:12:38.840 --> 02:12:40.840]  coming up this Sunday night.
[02:12:40.840 --> 02:12:42.840]  But don't just tune in at 7 o'clock
[02:12:42.840 --> 02:12:44.840]  Eastern on Sunday night.
[02:12:44.840 --> 02:12:46.840]  Tune in before for the services and so much more.
[02:12:46.840 --> 02:12:48.840]  Pastor Howard, I love you, and I appreciate you.
[02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:50.840]  Alex, if you had told me all the years ago
[02:12:50.840 --> 02:12:52.840]  that you'd be sitting here in our studio,
[02:12:52.840 --> 02:12:54.840]  I'd have said impossible.
[02:12:54.840 --> 02:12:56.840]  It looked like a great gulf between us.
[02:12:56.840 --> 02:12:58.840]  But as I've always told people,
[02:12:58.840 --> 02:13:00.840]  you're the tip of the spear
[02:13:00.840 --> 02:13:02.840]  and came out years ago
[02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:04.840]  revealing to everybody
[02:13:04.840 --> 02:13:06.840]  what now is common knowledge worldwide.
[02:13:06.840 --> 02:13:08.840]  And I mean, no matter where you go in Europe,
[02:13:08.840 --> 02:13:10.840]  Africa, people want you.
[02:13:10.840 --> 02:13:12.840]  And you're the one that's really sparked
[02:13:12.840 --> 02:13:14.840]  an awakening for people to understand
[02:13:14.840 --> 02:13:16.840]  what the deep state is
[02:13:16.840 --> 02:13:18.840]  and what they're actually doing
[02:13:18.840 --> 02:13:20.840]  and what their plans are.
[02:13:20.840 --> 02:13:22.840]  And so we salute you.
[02:13:22.840 --> 02:13:24.840]  Well, you too.
[02:13:24.840 --> 02:13:26.840]  In fact, I have a clip
[02:13:26.840 --> 02:13:28.840]  because I know you've written books on this.
[02:13:28.840 --> 02:13:30.840]  You've talked about it, but I have a clip from you in the 90s.
[02:13:30.840 --> 02:13:32.840]  We're going to get in a few minutes of play.
[02:13:32.840 --> 02:13:34.840]  I forgot to send it to them until just right now.
[02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:36.840]  Where you talked about the great awakening,
[02:13:36.840 --> 02:13:38.840]  the next great awakening.
[02:13:38.840 --> 02:13:40.840]  Now, we know there's scientific terms for this.
[02:13:40.840 --> 02:13:42.840]  They're called great turnings.
[02:13:42.840 --> 02:13:44.840]  We're going into a fourth turning right now.
[02:13:44.840 --> 02:13:46.840]  It's been scientifically, historically proven,
[02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:48.840]  not just spiritually proven,
[02:13:48.840 --> 02:13:50.840]  but the Bible talks a lot about it as well.
[02:13:50.840 --> 02:13:52.840]  There's a time to reap, a time to sow,
[02:13:52.840 --> 02:13:54.840]  and there's cycles in everything.
[02:13:54.840 --> 02:13:56.840]  But you, by the Holy Spirit,
[02:13:56.840 --> 02:13:58.840]  that's so strong with you and your church,
[02:13:58.840 --> 02:14:00.840]  I can feel it. I just feel so calm
[02:14:00.840 --> 02:14:02.840]  and just energized here at the same time.
[02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:04.840]  I don't feel the darkness I feel,
[02:14:04.840 --> 02:14:06.840]  quite frankly, in my hometown Austin
[02:14:06.840 --> 02:14:08.840]  and where my family's from.
[02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:10.840]  It's really been taken over by darkness.
[02:14:10.840 --> 02:14:12.840]  You can feel it there when you enter the city,
[02:14:12.840 --> 02:14:14.840]  the spirit that's over it.
[02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:16.840]  But right here, I feel a bubble of just the Holy Spirit.
[02:14:16.840 --> 02:14:18.840]  It feels so good.
[02:14:18.840 --> 02:14:20.840]  In fact, it makes me...
[02:14:20.840 --> 02:14:22.840]  I'm going to keep the crew there.
[02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:24.840]  We're going to try to phase that over.
[02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:26.840]  I'm going to move to Sarasota or Tampa
[02:14:26.840 --> 02:14:28.840]  and I'm going to evacuate Texas
[02:14:28.840 --> 02:14:30.840]  in the near future.
[02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:32.840]  I'm going to be moving here, brother.
[02:14:32.840 --> 02:14:34.840]  I'm going to go ahead and make that announcement now.
[02:14:34.840 --> 02:14:36.840]  That's just the way it is.
[02:14:36.840 --> 02:14:38.840]  Texas is still good outside the cities,
[02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:40.840]  but all the cities have fallen
[02:14:40.840 --> 02:14:42.840]  to communists and George Soros people.
[02:14:42.840 --> 02:14:44.840]  You can't live there.
[02:14:44.840 --> 02:14:46.840]  It just came out in the Washington Post,
[02:14:46.840 --> 02:14:48.840]  a 20-page article,
[02:14:48.840 --> 02:14:50.840]  that people have been trying to indict me
[02:14:50.840 --> 02:14:52.840]  for two and a half years, January 6th,
[02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:54.840]  even though they know I'm innocent.
[02:14:54.840 --> 02:14:56.840]  The head of the Justice Department had to tell them no
[02:14:56.840 --> 02:14:58.840]  because it would just make them look too bad.
[02:14:58.840 --> 02:15:00.840]  That's how serious this is.
[02:15:00.840 --> 02:15:02.840]  When you live in a jurisdiction run by these people,
[02:15:02.840 --> 02:15:04.840]  they can throw you under the jail.
[02:15:04.840 --> 02:15:06.840]  Austin is run by George Soros.
[02:15:06.840 --> 02:15:08.840]  All the judges are George Soros now.
[02:15:08.840 --> 02:15:10.840]  Every one of them is a George Soros paid-for woman.
[02:15:10.840 --> 02:15:12.840]  I think it's women as judges,
[02:15:12.840 --> 02:15:14.840]  but they're all literal green- and purple-haired judges.
[02:15:14.840 --> 02:15:16.840]  No more men.
[02:15:16.840 --> 02:15:18.840]  I'm in Austin, but I want to say it's fallen.
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:20.840]  I'm probably going to have some operations
[02:15:20.840 --> 02:15:22.840]  somewhere near Austin, maybe Georgetown that's red,
[02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:24.840]  where I am, and then part of the time
[02:15:24.840 --> 02:15:26.840]  here in Florida because I've got to get near
[02:15:26.840 --> 02:15:28.840]  all the stuff that's happening and going on.
[02:15:28.840 --> 02:15:30.840]  Roger Stone is so excited. He's getting ready to move here.
[02:15:30.840 --> 02:15:32.840]  I've had a lot of other big conservatives that live here.
[02:15:32.840 --> 02:15:34.840]  Tucker lives about an hour and a half south of here.
[02:15:34.840 --> 02:15:36.840]  All encouraged me to move here.
[02:15:36.840 --> 02:15:38.840]  When you've got Tucker Carlson and Rodney Howard Brown
[02:15:38.840 --> 02:15:40.840]  and Roger Stone, everybody else telling you to move here,
[02:15:40.840 --> 02:15:42.840]  you've got to do it. I'm ranting. You're my guest this hour.
[02:15:42.840 --> 02:15:44.840]  My goodness with the energy in here.
[02:15:44.840 --> 02:15:46.840]  So, Pastor, I'm going to shut up now,
[02:15:46.840 --> 02:15:48.840]  but tell us about, because the Q folks, who we love to death,
[02:15:48.840 --> 02:15:50.840]  they say, we talk about the Great Awakening,
[02:15:50.840 --> 02:15:52.840]  we're stealing it from them. Or we talk about
[02:15:52.840 --> 02:15:54.840]  FEMA camps, that's Q, or Bilderberg,
[02:15:54.840 --> 02:15:56.840]  that's Q. I thought that was us
[02:15:56.840 --> 02:15:58.840]  decades ago exposing it. But, okay, Q
[02:15:58.840 --> 02:16:00.840]  discovered it, and then got the time machine and came forward
[02:16:00.840 --> 02:16:02.840]  and told us about it. But no, the Great Awakening
[02:16:02.840 --> 02:16:04.840]  belongs to God, not to Q, right? Or I guess
[02:16:04.840 --> 02:16:06.840]  Q is God? Which I was
[02:16:06.840 --> 02:16:08.840]  on this Great Awakening, which you'll see
[02:16:08.840 --> 02:16:10.840]  from the clip back in 93,
[02:16:10.840 --> 02:16:12.840]  which is the spiritual awakening.
[02:16:12.840 --> 02:16:14.840]  When I keep talking about that, then they're all
[02:16:14.840 --> 02:16:16.840]  associating me with the Q movement. I said, look,
[02:16:16.840 --> 02:16:18.840]  I've got nothing to do with that. You guys
[02:16:18.840 --> 02:16:20.840]  hijacked my terminology.
[02:16:20.840 --> 02:16:22.840]  But there's a spiritual awakening that
[02:16:22.840 --> 02:16:24.840]  is taking place. It's happening across
[02:16:24.840 --> 02:16:26.840]  Africa. It's happening across Europe.
[02:16:26.840 --> 02:16:28.840]  And you've been predicting it. Yes, sir.
[02:16:28.840 --> 02:16:30.840]  That's your main thing. I just felt that
[02:16:30.840 --> 02:16:32.840]  in my spirit back in 93.
[02:16:32.840 --> 02:16:34.840]  Every time you're on my show, you say this.
[02:16:34.840 --> 02:16:36.840]  And I didn't even understand what I was saying,
[02:16:36.840 --> 02:16:38.840]  necessarily, because I didn't even know
[02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:40.840]  that the Lord would bring me into an area of
[02:16:40.840 --> 02:16:42.840]  governmental things, you know?
[02:16:42.840 --> 02:16:44.840]  I mean, they were playing the clip in the background.
[02:16:44.840 --> 02:16:46.840]  We're going to play the video in a minute. Keep telling us about it.
[02:16:46.840 --> 02:16:48.840]  Pause for a moment. You know how I am.
[02:16:48.840 --> 02:16:50.840]  No, so I didn't understand that the
[02:16:50.840 --> 02:16:52.840]  Lord was preparing us.
[02:16:52.840 --> 02:16:54.840]  I never took enough time. I was doing two
[02:16:54.840 --> 02:16:56.840]  meetings a day, six days a week,
[02:16:56.840 --> 02:16:58.840]  46 weeks a year. So I never
[02:16:58.840 --> 02:17:00.840]  sat down to ponder.
[02:17:00.840 --> 02:17:02.840]  And I told you this last time we were on
[02:17:02.840 --> 02:17:04.840]  the show together. I went to the first Bush
[02:17:04.840 --> 02:17:06.840]  inauguration. I stood right there.
[02:17:06.840 --> 02:17:08.840]  And I was looking, and I said to my wife,
[02:17:08.840 --> 02:17:10.840]  this is not America.
[02:17:10.840 --> 02:17:12.840]  So I left there, and she said, what do you feel?
[02:17:12.840 --> 02:17:14.840]  I said, I feel like it's a CEO
[02:17:14.840 --> 02:17:16.840]  handing over to another CEO.
[02:17:16.840 --> 02:17:18.840]  I didn't feel America there.
[02:17:18.840 --> 02:17:20.840]  And so when he got elected
[02:17:20.840 --> 02:17:22.840]  again, or, you know, the whole thing with the trans
[02:17:22.840 --> 02:17:24.840]  and whatever, I went again.
[02:17:24.840 --> 02:17:26.840]  I stood there, right by
[02:17:26.840 --> 02:17:28.840]  the boxing promoter
[02:17:28.840 --> 02:17:30.840]  dunking with a hair, you know.
[02:17:30.840 --> 02:17:32.840]  So I got a picture with him.
[02:17:32.840 --> 02:17:34.840]  But again, when I left that inauguration,
[02:17:34.840 --> 02:17:36.840]  I said, this is just
[02:17:36.840 --> 02:17:38.840]  a corporate transfer.
[02:17:38.840 --> 02:17:40.840]  And then, of course, when I started looking,
[02:17:40.840 --> 02:17:42.840]  and then I realized the Bushes and the Clintons were
[02:17:42.840 --> 02:17:44.840]  friends, household friends.
[02:17:44.840 --> 02:17:46.840]  And you wrote Killing Uncle Sam. That is the
[02:17:46.840 --> 02:17:48.840]  book. It shocked me.
[02:17:48.840 --> 02:17:50.840]  I actually was devastated. I was
[02:17:50.840 --> 02:17:52.840]  totally devastated when I found out what
[02:17:52.840 --> 02:17:54.840]  was actually happening to America. Because you'd already fled
[02:17:54.840 --> 02:17:56.840]  tyranny and seen your country destroyed. Yeah.
[02:17:56.840 --> 02:17:58.840]  And I said to my wife, what have they done to my
[02:17:58.840 --> 02:18:00.840]  America? Because I became an American.
[02:18:00.840 --> 02:18:02.840]  So I said, what have they done to my
[02:18:02.840 --> 02:18:04.840]  America? So it was, like, devastating. But then I
[02:18:04.840 --> 02:18:06.840]  began to realize that the only hope
[02:18:06.840 --> 02:18:08.840]  was a great spiritual awakening.
[02:18:08.840 --> 02:18:10.840]  But, I mean, I was talking about that in
[02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:12.840]  93. So now,
[02:18:12.840 --> 02:18:14.840]  I'm trying to think about when
[02:18:14.840 --> 02:18:16.840]  I started really delving into
[02:18:16.840 --> 02:18:18.840]  everything. And I remember I'd read that book,
[02:18:18.840 --> 02:18:20.840]  Nondé Called a Conspiracy,
[02:18:20.840 --> 02:18:22.840]  as a teenager. That woke me up too.
[02:18:22.840 --> 02:18:24.840]  In Southern Africa. But you still feel
[02:18:24.840 --> 02:18:26.840]  disconnected from the Fed, the private central
[02:18:26.840 --> 02:18:28.840]  bank, and all this kind of stuff.
[02:18:28.840 --> 02:18:30.840]  But then you start seeing all this stuff happening.
[02:18:30.840 --> 02:18:32.840]  And everybody says it's a conspiracy theory.
[02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:34.840]  So, from one conspiracy theorist
[02:18:34.840 --> 02:18:36.840]  to another, I'm so glad you're here.
[02:18:36.840 --> 02:18:38.840]  Well, that's the thing. You were talking about the New World Order
[02:18:38.840 --> 02:18:40.840]  when I was still in high school.
[02:18:40.840 --> 02:18:42.840]  Or college. So you've been doing this a long time.
[02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:44.840]  That's why I say you're my pastor. I don't disagree with you
[02:18:44.840 --> 02:18:46.840]  biblically and spiritually, but also
[02:18:46.840 --> 02:18:48.840]  you're entertaining, you're fun.
[02:18:48.840 --> 02:18:50.840]  The vibe here at your church is amazing.
[02:18:50.840 --> 02:18:52.840]  It's not bad in Florida. It feels
[02:18:52.840 --> 02:18:54.840]  better than areas of Texas. But you feel
[02:18:54.840 --> 02:18:56.840]  the spirit. But driving
[02:18:56.840 --> 02:18:58.840]  into the church grounds, it just feels like a weight
[02:18:58.840 --> 02:19:00.840]  lifts off you.
[02:19:00.840 --> 02:19:02.840]  Well, we have all night prayer meetings and everything.
[02:19:02.840 --> 02:19:04.840]  I mean, we realize that we're up against
[02:19:04.840 --> 02:19:06.840]  the powers of darkness, which a lot of people don't
[02:19:06.840 --> 02:19:08.840]  understand. They don't even believe in the
[02:19:08.840 --> 02:19:10.840]  supernatural. I mean, I come from Africa
[02:19:10.840 --> 02:19:12.840]  where there's witch doctors and whatever.
[02:19:12.840 --> 02:19:14.840]  Well, there's witch doctors. There's Satanists
[02:19:14.840 --> 02:19:16.840]  here in America. I mean, there's a
[02:19:16.840 --> 02:19:18.840]  big enclave in Orlando of
[02:19:18.840 --> 02:19:20.840]  satanic witches. People don't know that.
[02:19:20.840 --> 02:19:22.840]  As a fact, they fast
[02:19:22.840 --> 02:19:24.840]  and pray for ministers to collapse.
[02:19:24.840 --> 02:19:26.840]  They spend days fasting
[02:19:26.840 --> 02:19:28.840]  and praying for... If there's any pastor in
[02:19:28.840 --> 02:19:30.840]  Orlando, they basically fast and
[02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:32.840]  pray until they either have a divorce
[02:19:32.840 --> 02:19:34.840]  or the church collapses.
[02:19:34.840 --> 02:19:36.840]  You know what's so sad? I tend to read
[02:19:36.840 --> 02:19:38.840]  what left... In fact, I wasn't going to do this today. Maybe I will
[02:19:38.840 --> 02:19:40.840]  if we have time, but I want to get to this clip.
[02:19:40.840 --> 02:19:42.840]  When I see somebody...
[02:19:42.840 --> 02:19:44.840]  Because I'll randomly read comments on our videos
[02:19:44.840 --> 02:19:46.840]  or I'll see... I saw Don, one of our writers,
[02:19:46.840 --> 02:19:48.840]  has a Twitter account that hadn't been censored. He put out a video
[02:19:48.840 --> 02:19:50.840]  out yesterday that had like 50,000 views.
[02:19:50.840 --> 02:19:52.840]  And I thought...
[02:19:52.840 --> 02:19:54.840]  And we have videos out right now that got
[02:19:54.840 --> 02:19:56.840]  5,000... I mean, 5 million just in the last few days.
[02:19:56.840 --> 02:19:58.840]  That little video, I said, I'm going to read the comments on this.
[02:19:58.840 --> 02:20:00.840]  The Spirit told me that. That's what it is. The Holy Spirit just guides
[02:20:00.840 --> 02:20:02.840]  you everywhere. It gets where you just turn over to it
[02:20:02.840 --> 02:20:04.840]  and it's there. It's free will. It doesn't
[02:20:04.840 --> 02:20:06.840]  run you. You decide to let it run you.
[02:20:06.840 --> 02:20:08.840]  So I go... I'm going to read these comments. So I go in and I see a guy going,
[02:20:08.840 --> 02:20:10.840]  I hope you go bankrupt. I hope your paychecks
[02:20:10.840 --> 02:20:12.840]  bounce, Don Salazar, for your horrible
[02:20:12.840 --> 02:20:14.840]  boss or whatever it said. So I go, I'm going to go
[02:20:14.840 --> 02:20:16.840]  read this guy's profile. So I go
[02:20:16.840 --> 02:20:18.840]  read his profile. He's got like a couple hundred followers
[02:20:18.840 --> 02:20:20.840]  and he can't get work.
[02:20:20.840 --> 02:20:22.840]  He's a leftist writer. He's all bummed out
[02:20:22.840 --> 02:20:24.840]  and he's wishing all these horrible things
[02:20:24.840 --> 02:20:26.840]  on conservatives and Christians and saying
[02:20:26.840 --> 02:20:28.840]  we're all frauds and all this. And then I read
[02:20:28.840 --> 02:20:30.840]  my 40-year-old wife
[02:20:30.840 --> 02:20:32.840]  just collapsed with a massive stroke.
[02:20:32.840 --> 02:20:34.840]  Please go fund me
[02:20:34.840 --> 02:20:36.840]  for her. And then I went and read
[02:20:36.840 --> 02:20:38.840]  deeper and I said, when I read deeper, in the last few
[02:20:38.840 --> 02:20:40.840]  months, he's going to be attacking anti-vaxxers
[02:20:40.840 --> 02:20:42.840]  and saying how much he loves the shots. What do you
[02:20:42.840 --> 02:20:44.840]  think I found? And then I found him saying...
[02:20:44.840 --> 02:20:46.840]  So his wife has had a stroke. You know
[02:20:46.840 --> 02:20:48.840]  she's taken it. But I want to actually reach
[02:20:48.840 --> 02:20:50.840]  out to him. He told me the story about the watch guy
[02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:52.840]  he woke up. I really...
[02:20:52.840 --> 02:20:54.840]  It laid on my heart. I want to reach out to that guy
[02:20:54.840 --> 02:20:56.840]  maybe try to donate some to help his wife
[02:20:56.840 --> 02:20:58.840]  and see if she took the shot. But imagine
[02:20:58.840 --> 02:21:00.840]  if she did, which I think they did. They're big proponents
[02:21:00.840 --> 02:21:02.840]  for it. How blind he is.
[02:21:02.840 --> 02:21:04.840]  He's like
[02:21:04.840 --> 02:21:06.840]  NJ Sullivan. And so he's wishing
[02:21:06.840 --> 02:21:08.840]  all these horrible things. And then you go read
[02:21:08.840 --> 02:21:10.840]  about him and his wife's fighting for her life.
[02:21:10.840 --> 02:21:12.840]  Horrible, devastating stroke. She's
[02:21:12.840 --> 02:21:14.840]  young. Go to his page.
[02:21:14.840 --> 02:21:16.840]  NJ Sullivan. And then look at his GoFundMe.
[02:21:16.840 --> 02:21:18.840]  It's right at the top for his wife.
[02:21:18.840 --> 02:21:20.840]  She's literally got pink hair. Nothing against that.
[02:21:20.840 --> 02:21:22.840]  They don't have jobs. They're leftists. I think they live
[02:21:22.840 --> 02:21:24.840]  on the West Coast. And they're being
[02:21:24.840 --> 02:21:26.840]  totally cursed by the system.
[02:21:26.840 --> 02:21:28.840]  But he's down there hoping bad things against us.
[02:21:28.840 --> 02:21:30.840]  And then the system
[02:21:30.840 --> 02:21:32.840]  I believe will probably turn on his wife. I mean look at this.
[02:21:32.840 --> 02:21:34.840]  This is so sad. But that's just a microcosm of what
[02:21:34.840 --> 02:21:36.840]  you were saying. Totally. And your heart actually
[02:21:36.840 --> 02:21:38.840]  breaks because they... Even today
[02:21:38.840 --> 02:21:40.840]  somebody was going off to me
[02:21:40.840 --> 02:21:42.840]  on Twitter because what they were saying was
[02:21:42.840 --> 02:21:44.840]  that the governor pardoned me.
[02:21:44.840 --> 02:21:46.840]  Governor DeSantis did not pardon me.
[02:21:46.840 --> 02:21:48.840]  He pardoned people in generally
[02:21:48.840 --> 02:21:50.840]  but no one in particular
[02:21:50.840 --> 02:21:52.840]  in 2021. I was
[02:21:52.840 --> 02:21:54.840]  arrested in March of 2020.
[02:21:54.840 --> 02:21:56.840]  The city dropped charges when he made
[02:21:56.840 --> 02:21:58.840]  church a central service. That's all.
[02:21:58.840 --> 02:22:00.840]  I've never received a letter from the governor.
[02:22:00.840 --> 02:22:02.840]  I've never received a phone call. And I don't need
[02:22:02.840 --> 02:22:04.840]  a phone call. I voted for him for governor.
[02:22:04.840 --> 02:22:06.840]  I'm not voting for him for president.
[02:22:06.840 --> 02:22:08.840]  Are you with me? It's a big difference.
[02:22:08.840 --> 02:22:10.840]  We're trying to attack you like it's some political quip
[02:22:10.840 --> 02:22:12.840]  for a quote. But I believe Ron DeSantis
[02:22:12.840 --> 02:22:14.840]  should be governor for another four years
[02:22:14.840 --> 02:22:16.840]  until he's 2028.
[02:22:16.840 --> 02:22:18.840]  But anyway, that's another story.
[02:22:18.840 --> 02:22:20.840]  They were trying to say here
[02:22:20.840 --> 02:22:22.840]  Rodney Brown was pardoned by
[02:22:22.840 --> 02:22:24.840]  Governor DeSantis. I was not. So now
[02:22:24.840 --> 02:22:26.840]  you get an argument with the guy. The guy
[02:22:26.840 --> 02:22:28.840]  starts arguing with me. Well, you didn't shut the church down.
[02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:30.840]  We didn't know in March of 2020
[02:22:30.840 --> 02:22:32.840]  what the virus was doing. I said, we did
[02:22:32.840 --> 02:22:34.840]  know. He said, you're making that up. You didn't
[02:22:34.840 --> 02:22:36.840]  know. I actually did know. I knew
[02:22:36.840 --> 02:22:38.840]  about the lockdowns in 2005.
[02:22:38.840 --> 02:22:40.840]  So you can't...
[02:22:40.840 --> 02:22:42.840]  That's right. You've done whole sermons on it.
[02:22:42.840 --> 02:22:44.840]  So you can't get in an argument with
[02:22:44.840 --> 02:22:46.840]  me. You warn people about lockdowns, all that
[02:22:46.840 --> 02:22:48.840]  previous stuff. So I try to tell
[02:22:48.840 --> 02:22:50.840]  him, bro, please. I've been in 88
[02:22:50.840 --> 02:22:52.840]  countries, 43 years. I don't want to talk.
[02:22:52.840 --> 02:22:54.840]  I know more than you do.
[02:22:54.840 --> 02:22:56.840]  So then, of course, he doesn't know. He's got to call me names.
[02:22:56.840 --> 02:22:58.840]  It becomes this whole big thing.
[02:22:58.840 --> 02:23:00.840]  But so you get these people who just
[02:23:00.840 --> 02:23:02.840]  think you just make stuff up. We're not
[02:23:02.840 --> 02:23:04.840]  making stuff up. This stuff is real.
[02:23:04.840 --> 02:23:06.840]  And, you know, even with the killing of Uncle
[02:23:06.840 --> 02:23:08.840]  Sam, which if you go to my Wikipedia
[02:23:08.840 --> 02:23:10.840]  page, I'm a conspiracy theorist.
[02:23:10.840 --> 02:23:12.840]  I just make this stuff up. But
[02:23:12.840 --> 02:23:14.840]  it is a thousand foot notes. So I challenge
[02:23:14.840 --> 02:23:16.840]  people, go through the footnotes,
[02:23:16.840 --> 02:23:18.840]  find one mistake,
[02:23:18.840 --> 02:23:20.840]  factually, and I'll get up and repent.
[02:23:20.840 --> 02:23:22.840]  Instead of reading them, Dare Call it Conspiracy,
[02:23:22.840 --> 02:23:24.840]  or Carol Quigley's Tragedy and Hope, written
[02:23:24.840 --> 02:23:26.840]  from their perspective, or Brzezinski's
[02:23:26.840 --> 02:23:28.840]  books, which I've read them all, you can read...
[02:23:28.840 --> 02:23:30.840]  And his book is thick, but it's a fast read.
[02:23:30.840 --> 02:23:32.840]  You read... This is the one book,
[02:23:32.840 --> 02:23:34.840]  I would say, the Bible of the real history
[02:23:34.840 --> 02:23:36.840]  of Cecil Rhodes, the New World Order, how the
[02:23:36.840 --> 02:23:38.840]  modern groups work, how they took over. And they can get
[02:23:38.840 --> 02:23:40.840]  it through Infowars. It's an incredible book.
[02:23:40.840 --> 02:23:42.840]  No, so
[02:23:42.840 --> 02:23:44.840]  the people think we're making this stuff up.
[02:23:44.840 --> 02:23:46.840]  Why would we make anything up?
[02:23:46.840 --> 02:23:48.840]  Why? What? For what?
[02:23:48.840 --> 02:23:50.840]  Well, they see the videos of me
[02:23:50.840 --> 02:23:52.840]  in 2012
[02:23:52.840 --> 02:23:54.840]  saying they're gonna
[02:23:54.840 --> 02:23:56.840]  lock you down, make you wear masks, no more sports
[02:23:56.840 --> 02:23:58.840]  games, and forcibly inject you. And
[02:23:58.840 --> 02:24:00.840]  they say, this must be fake, or this must be a deep
[02:24:00.840 --> 02:24:02.840]  fake. Jones couldn't know this much.
[02:24:02.840 --> 02:24:04.840]  Or they go, oh, he's a Fed. No!
[02:24:04.840 --> 02:24:06.840]  The Rockefeller Foundation and the UN
[02:24:06.840 --> 02:24:08.840]  planned it in 2011,
[02:24:08.840 --> 02:24:10.840]  made it policy in 2012, and Bush
[02:24:10.840 --> 02:24:12.840]  thought about doing it, you learned previously
[02:24:12.840 --> 02:24:14.840]  in 2005, you got the public documents
[02:24:14.840 --> 02:24:16.840]  where they were planning the exact same lockdown.
[02:24:16.840 --> 02:24:18.840]  Totally. So why would we
[02:24:18.840 --> 02:24:20.840]  risk our whole life
[02:24:20.840 --> 02:24:22.840]  and reputation for
[02:24:22.840 --> 02:24:24.840]  nonsense?
[02:24:24.840 --> 02:24:26.840]  We've gone through, we've vetted everything.
[02:24:26.840 --> 02:24:28.840]  We've checked everything from every angle.
[02:24:28.840 --> 02:24:30.840]  Plus, when you travel to 88 countries,
[02:24:30.840 --> 02:24:32.840]  you see the exact same thing.
[02:24:32.840 --> 02:24:34.840]  It's not Republican, Democrat.
[02:24:34.840 --> 02:24:36.840]  It's not
[02:24:36.840 --> 02:24:38.840]  Biden or Trump.
[02:24:38.840 --> 02:24:40.840]  Let's play this short 3-minute clip
[02:24:40.840 --> 02:24:42.840]  of Pastor Rodney Howard Brown
[02:24:42.840 --> 02:24:44.840]  who you'll hear this Sunday.
[02:24:44.840 --> 02:24:46.840]  If you go to Revival.com, I'll be here. I'll be part of the
[02:24:46.840 --> 02:24:48.840]  nighttime event as well.
[02:24:48.840 --> 02:24:50.840]  It's called An Evening with Alex Jones. Take your questions.
[02:24:50.840 --> 02:24:52.840]  We'll be speaking. But here's a clip
[02:24:52.840 --> 02:24:54.840]  of Rodney Howard Brown stealing
[02:24:54.840 --> 02:24:56.840]  from Q the Great Awakening.
[02:24:56.840 --> 02:24:58.840]  Here he is.
[02:25:06.840 --> 02:25:08.840]  ...
[02:25:16.840 --> 02:25:18.840]  God is not finished with America.
[02:25:18.840 --> 02:25:20.840]  I hear the sound
[02:25:20.840 --> 02:25:22.840]  of the army of the Lord.
[02:25:22.840 --> 02:25:24.840]  Tramp, tramp,
[02:25:24.840 --> 02:25:26.840]  tramp, tramp,
[02:25:26.840 --> 02:25:28.840]  tramp, tramp.
[02:25:28.840 --> 02:25:30.840]  We haven't seen anything yet.
[02:25:30.840 --> 02:25:32.840]  God is going to shake this
[02:25:32.840 --> 02:25:34.840]  country.
[02:25:34.840 --> 02:25:41.520]  You're going to take your city for God, you're going to take your county for God, you're
[02:25:41.520 --> 02:25:45.039]  going to take your state for God, you're going to take your nation for God.
[02:25:45.039 --> 02:25:51.279]  God has called us to go into the cities of this nation and to have crusades.
[02:25:51.279 --> 02:25:55.279]  God's not finished with America, I've got good news for you, God's not finished with
[02:25:55.279 --> 02:25:56.279]  this land.
[02:25:56.279 --> 02:25:57.279]  You mean what we've had already?
[02:25:57.279 --> 02:26:00.279]  No, this is just pepper talk, this is just pepper rage.
[02:26:01.279 --> 02:26:05.279]  We've got to have an awakening in this land.
[02:26:05.279 --> 02:26:06.279]  We have to have it.
[02:26:06.279 --> 02:26:10.760]  If you've been touched by the fire of revival in the past nine years, I give you a charge
[02:26:10.760 --> 02:26:15.400]  by the Holy Ghost to make this cause your cause and to look at the overall picture of
[02:26:15.400 --> 02:26:20.600]  these 50 states being shaken by the power of revival and the move of the Spirit of
[02:26:20.600 --> 02:26:21.600]  God.
[02:26:21.600 --> 02:26:27.600]  You and I have been brought into the kingdom of God for such a time as this with a divine
[02:26:27.920 --> 02:26:29.920]  purpose and a divine plan.
[02:26:29.920 --> 02:26:34.920]  A revival and move of God that will shake this nation.
[02:26:34.920 --> 02:26:38.920]  God has a plan and a purpose for the United States of America.
[02:26:38.920 --> 02:26:43.920]  God is going to visit this land with a great awakening that is going to shake America to
[02:26:43.920 --> 02:26:46.920]  the very foundation and to the very core.
[02:26:46.920 --> 02:26:49.920]  We've got to have him back in our courts.
[02:26:49.920 --> 02:26:52.920]  We've got to have him back in our nation.
[02:26:52.920 --> 02:26:55.920]  We've got to have him in America.
[02:26:56.240 --> 02:27:01.240]  The Lord promised us a great awakening in America.
[02:27:01.240 --> 02:27:07.240]  From the White House to every house, Washington, D.C. will tremble under the mighty hand of
[02:27:07.240 --> 02:27:08.240]  God.
[02:27:08.240 --> 02:27:12.240]  New York City will tremble in the mighty hand of God.
[02:27:12.240 --> 02:27:16.240]  Los Angeles will tremble in the mighty hand of God.
[02:27:16.240 --> 02:27:20.240]  We believe in God ultimately to take this whole nation.
[02:27:20.240 --> 02:27:25.240]  In 2007, my God, you think you don't know when to happen.
[02:27:25.560 --> 02:27:28.560]  In 2008, it'll seem like we're right at the gate.
[02:27:28.560 --> 02:27:32.560]  I'm telling you, this is it, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:27:32.560 --> 02:27:36.560]  This next wave of God will hit the marketplace.
[02:27:36.560 --> 02:27:38.560]  It's going to hit Wall Street.
[02:27:38.560 --> 02:27:39.560]  It's going to hit the Congress.
[02:27:39.560 --> 02:27:40.560]  It's going to hit the Senate.
[02:27:40.560 --> 02:27:42.560]  I see hospitals being emptied.
[02:27:42.560 --> 02:27:44.560]  I see deaf schools being emptied.
[02:27:44.560 --> 02:27:46.560]  I see blind schools being emptied.
[02:27:46.560 --> 02:27:50.560]  I see mental institutions being emptied with those being held captive.
[02:27:50.880 --> 02:27:55.880]  I see railroad stations jammed with people as trains coming into town,
[02:27:55.880 --> 02:27:57.880]  carrying those full of the glory of God.
[02:27:57.880 --> 02:28:02.880]  I see airports jammed, traffic jammed, whole cities shut down by the glory of God.
[02:28:02.880 --> 02:28:04.880]  What we're about to see is something bigger.
[02:28:04.880 --> 02:28:10.880]  This is a great, it's called the Great Awakening.
[02:28:10.880 --> 02:28:19.880]  And they know it's come.
[02:28:19.880 --> 02:28:21.880]  That's why they tried to lock the churches down,
[02:28:21.880 --> 02:28:24.880]  and that's why you were the first preacher to be arrested for refusing to stay locked down.
[02:28:24.880 --> 02:28:30.880]  Because the only hope is a spiritual awakening when people come back to God.
[02:28:30.880 --> 02:28:32.880]  If you look at the foundation of America,
[02:28:32.880 --> 02:28:36.880]  that first Great Awakening that took place in the 1700s,
[02:28:36.880 --> 02:28:41.880]  that actually caused the 13 colonies to really become one nation.
[02:28:41.880 --> 02:28:43.880]  We're going to go to break, sir. Stay with us.
[02:28:57.880 --> 02:29:01.880]  Two amazing nootropics, that means brain power,

[02:30:13.880 --> 02:30:19.880]  It's not just wide-spectrum natural herbs that time-release over 10 hours.
[02:30:19.880 --> 02:30:21.880]  It should be called 10-hour energy.
[02:30:21.880 --> 02:30:25.880]  It has a bunch of vitamins and minerals and a bunch of other key things,
[02:30:25.880 --> 02:30:30.880]  and amino acids that turbocharge everything and are good for your heart,
[02:30:30.880 --> 02:30:33.880]  your brain, your liver, you name it.
[02:30:33.880 --> 02:30:36.880]  It is the super fuel.
[02:30:36.880 --> 02:30:38.880]  Brain Force Plus is great.
[02:30:38.880 --> 02:30:39.880]  Brain Force Ultra is great.
[02:30:39.880 --> 02:30:40.880]  They're two different nootropics.
[02:30:40.880 --> 02:30:43.880]  They go good with this, but this is the King Kong.
[02:30:43.880 --> 02:30:45.880]  This is the boss.
[02:30:45.880 --> 02:30:50.880]  Turbo Force, back in stock, discounted, InfoWarsTore.com.

[02:31:21.880 --> 02:31:26.880]  But the one thing that I have really found that makes a difference is Brain Force.
[02:31:26.880 --> 02:31:30.880]  I'll take Brain Force in the morning right before I go to my computer,
[02:31:30.880 --> 02:31:34.880]  and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a whole lot of stuff.

[02:31:39.880 --> 02:31:40.880]  and it helps me with my writing.

[02:31:56.880 --> 02:31:59.880]  There is a war for the future happening right now.
[02:31:59.880 --> 02:32:04.880]  There is a war that will control my destiny, your destiny, our children's destinies,
[02:32:04.880 --> 02:32:08.880]  and that war is something that we can win, but it takes dedication.

[02:32:58.880 --> 02:33:04.880]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:07.230 --> 02:33:22.230]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[02:33:22.230 --> 02:33:32.029]  Live from Austin, Texas, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:32.029 --> 02:33:35.390]  And Pastor Rodney Howard Brown is hosting us here on the Alex Jones Show today.
[02:33:35.390 --> 02:33:36.390]  He got cut off by the break.
[02:33:36.390 --> 02:33:37.390]  Please continue, Pastor.
[02:33:37.390 --> 02:33:38.390]  All right.
[02:33:38.390 --> 02:33:43.310]  So, in the book of Jeremiah, and this is what people don't understand, because they want
[02:33:43.310 --> 02:33:48.630]  you, or if you're Christian or the church, you've got to be quiet and shut up.
[02:33:48.630 --> 02:33:50.590]  They want you to just shut up.
[02:33:50.590 --> 02:33:56.150]  But in Jeremiah chapter 1, then the word of the Lord came into verse 4, it came to me
[02:33:56.150 --> 02:33:58.789]  saying, before I formed in the belly, I knew you.
[02:33:58.789 --> 02:34:02.910]  And before you came forth out of the womb, I sanctified you, I set you apart and ordained
[02:34:02.910 --> 02:34:04.630]  you a prophet in the nation.
[02:34:04.630 --> 02:34:07.670]  Then I said, O Lord, behold, I cannot speak for I'm a child.
[02:34:07.670 --> 02:34:12.470]  But the Lord said to me, Say not, I'm a child, for you shall go to all that I send you.
[02:34:12.470 --> 02:34:15.550]  And whatsoever I command you, you will speak.
[02:34:15.550 --> 02:34:20.150]  Be not afraid of their faces, for I am with you to deliver you, saith the Lord.
[02:34:20.150 --> 02:34:22.390]  Then the Lord put forth his hand, touched my mouth.
[02:34:22.390 --> 02:34:25.350]  And the Lord said to me, Behold, I put my words in your mouth.
[02:34:25.350 --> 02:34:30.949]  See I've set this day you over the nations and over the kingdoms to root out, pull down,
[02:34:30.949 --> 02:34:33.350]  destroy, throw down, build and plant.
[02:34:33.350 --> 02:34:36.990]  So if you talk to a lot of spiritual leaders, everything is about building and planting,
[02:34:36.990 --> 02:34:41.230]  but you've got to root out, pull down, destroy, throw down.
[02:34:41.230 --> 02:34:45.990]  So if you plant a garden, you can't just put seed there, you have to go in, you have to
[02:34:45.990 --> 02:34:51.310]  root out, pull down, destroy, throw down, whatever's in the way, and then cultivate
[02:34:51.310 --> 02:34:52.310]  everything and get it ready.
[02:34:52.310 --> 02:34:55.189]  And that's what the Satanists are trying to do to us with their Build Back Better Great
[02:34:55.189 --> 02:34:58.029]  Reset is they want to pull us up and plant their crop.
[02:34:58.029 --> 02:34:59.029]  Basically.
[02:34:59.029 --> 02:35:00.029]  And that's what they're doing.
[02:35:00.029 --> 02:35:04.109]  And they're getting the kids in the first seven years and they indoctrinated them.
[02:35:04.109 --> 02:35:09.029]  That's what they're doing with the whole thing of the gender, messing up the whole thing
[02:35:09.029 --> 02:35:11.689]  where kids don't even know what they are.
[02:35:11.689 --> 02:35:15.109]  Because if you can get a child in the first seven years, you have them.
[02:35:15.109 --> 02:35:20.390]  And so they're corrupting our teenagers and basically from daycare to university.
[02:35:20.390 --> 02:35:26.310]  By the time a person, a kid's 23 coming out of university, the parents can't even connect
[02:35:26.310 --> 02:35:27.310]  with them.
[02:35:27.310 --> 02:35:31.070]  They can't even know who these kids are because they basically took them and indoctrinated
[02:35:31.070 --> 02:35:34.630]  them away from God's purpose and plan for their life.
[02:35:34.630 --> 02:35:35.630]  Amazing.
[02:35:35.630 --> 02:35:37.350]  So God's got a plan.
[02:35:37.350 --> 02:35:41.390]  You know, I tell everybody watching here today, God has a plan for each and every person's
[02:35:41.390 --> 02:35:42.390]  life.
[02:35:42.390 --> 02:35:45.789]  It's just they've never found it out because they never consulted him.
[02:35:45.789 --> 02:35:50.029]  Even though the hand of God's actually been on their life for many years, God's protected
[02:35:50.029 --> 02:35:55.150]  them from calamity, times that he warned them, don't go there, whatever.
[02:35:55.150 --> 02:35:59.590]  The last time you were on with me and I was testifying about, and again, I'm not a preacher.
[02:35:59.590 --> 02:36:01.550]  I mean, God's always had his hand on me.
[02:36:01.550 --> 02:36:03.789]  I experienced what you're talking about here.
[02:36:03.789 --> 02:36:06.189]  And then it was always like this mission and these things that you're not supposed to do.
[02:36:06.189 --> 02:36:07.310]  You're supposed to do that.
[02:36:07.310 --> 02:36:09.109]  And basically being pushed into it.
[02:36:09.109 --> 02:36:14.910]  And then basically after I've been on there a few years, I had this big, intense moment
[02:36:14.910 --> 02:36:18.750]  of seeing the future and what I was going to do and I could feel the presence.
[02:36:18.750 --> 02:36:20.750]  It was like, it was frightening really.
[02:36:20.750 --> 02:36:24.310]  It was like, whoa, this is like, well, I'm okay.
[02:36:24.470 --> 02:36:26.470]  The air is like crackling, sitting there.
[02:36:26.470 --> 02:36:30.150]  I'm just in a restaurant doing my show on AXS TV for a few hours, eating them like nine
[02:36:30.150 --> 02:36:32.550]  o'clock that we're kind of closing it down, mopping and stuff.
[02:36:32.550 --> 02:36:34.869]  I felt this presence and like, you're going to do this.
[02:36:34.869 --> 02:36:35.670]  You're going to have this effect.
[02:36:35.670 --> 02:36:37.109]  I'm going to tell you what to do.
[02:36:37.109 --> 02:36:38.230]  And then I was always a Christian.
[02:36:38.230 --> 02:36:40.830]  I love God, but it was still kind of, I got a little bit worldly.
[02:36:40.830 --> 02:36:42.630]  God was this little thing off the side.
[02:36:42.630 --> 02:36:45.029]  And it was like, no, this is the main thing.
[02:36:45.029 --> 02:36:49.990]  And then as I've gone on for the next 25 years or so, it's gotten more intense now.
[02:36:49.990 --> 02:36:52.710]  People say, man, this guy's like preaching about God constantly.
[02:36:52.710 --> 02:36:54.230]  Well, look at the Satanism everywhere.
[02:36:54.230 --> 02:36:56.390]  But it's not like I'm even intellectually thinking it's about God.
[02:36:56.390 --> 02:36:58.869]  I can't stop talking about God because it's everywhere.
[02:36:58.869 --> 02:36:59.510]  Here's the thing.
[02:36:59.510 --> 02:37:01.510]  So they say there's no God.
[02:37:01.510 --> 02:37:03.910]  Then why are you worshiping the other one?
[02:37:03.910 --> 02:37:05.910]  Well, we're making a mistake, God, and all of us.
[02:37:05.910 --> 02:37:09.510]  Yeah, but they say there is no God, but why they worship Lucifer.
[02:37:09.510 --> 02:37:10.310]  Well, exactly.
[02:37:10.310 --> 02:37:11.510]  So if there is no God.
[02:37:11.510 --> 02:37:15.590]  Why did the head leftist say, I dedicate this book, Saul Alinsky, to Lucifer?
[02:37:15.590 --> 02:37:18.789]  And the left will say, oh, you know, the church is Satan and all those groups, the temple
[02:37:18.789 --> 02:37:19.350]  is Satan.
[02:37:19.350 --> 02:37:21.270]  They go, oh, we're just having fun to upset Christians.
[02:37:21.270 --> 02:37:22.310]  No, it's come out.
[02:37:22.310 --> 02:37:23.430]  They are really Satanist.
[02:37:24.070 --> 02:37:25.109]  I mean, it's a fact.
[02:37:25.109 --> 02:37:28.070]  But where do they get the idea even of Satan or Lucifer?
[02:37:28.070 --> 02:37:30.390]  The Bible already speaks of all these things.
[02:37:30.390 --> 02:37:31.990]  It's the same book that they reject.
[02:37:32.630 --> 02:37:36.230]  So even Jesus said, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.
[02:37:36.230 --> 02:37:39.670]  Remember when the disciples came to him and they were rejoicing with the fact that devils
[02:37:39.670 --> 02:37:41.830]  were subject through the name of Jesus.
[02:37:41.830 --> 02:37:45.910]  So Jesus said, don't rejoice at the fact that devils are subject through my name.
[02:37:45.910 --> 02:37:49.109]  Rejoice at the fact that your name is written down in the Lamb's book of life.
[02:37:49.109 --> 02:37:51.670]  He said, I beheld Satan as lightning fall from heaven.
[02:37:51.670 --> 02:37:56.630]  So people don't realize Lucifer was actually part of what God was doing.
[02:37:56.630 --> 02:37:58.070]  He led worship in heaven.
[02:37:58.070 --> 02:37:59.510]  He had pipes and tablets.
[02:37:59.510 --> 02:38:00.710]  The wind of God would blow.
[02:38:00.710 --> 02:38:02.630]  He would lead worship, but he got arrogant.
[02:38:03.270 --> 02:38:08.070]  And in his arrogance, he lifted himself up in pride and said, I will exalt myself above
[02:38:08.070 --> 02:38:09.189]  the throne of God.
[02:38:09.189 --> 02:38:13.029]  And basically, when God threw him out of heaven, he took a third of the angels with him.
[02:38:13.029 --> 02:38:20.390]  So you think about this whole battle that took place back then, even, you know, where we
[02:38:20.390 --> 02:38:26.150]  feel that it took place actually before Genesis 1, between Genesis 1, 1 and Genesis 1, 2,
[02:38:26.150 --> 02:38:31.029]  because it even says God created heaven and earth, and the earth was not without form
[02:38:31.029 --> 02:38:31.830]  and void.
[02:38:31.830 --> 02:38:35.510]  What there is was without form and void, but in darkness upon the face of the deep.
[02:38:35.510 --> 02:38:39.670]  So if you look at verse 1, verse 2, something happened between the two, because if you read
[02:38:39.670 --> 02:38:43.109]  in Jeremiah, it says God doesn't make anything without form or void.
[02:38:43.109 --> 02:38:44.230]  So something happened.
[02:38:44.230 --> 02:38:49.670]  It was like, and so obviously, you know, the Bible even speaks about a pre-Adamic race,
[02:38:49.750 --> 02:38:54.150]  because when God spoke to him in the garden, he said, be fruitful, multiply and replenish
[02:38:54.150 --> 02:38:54.789]  the earth.
[02:38:54.789 --> 02:38:55.350]  You can't.
[02:38:55.350 --> 02:38:55.830]  Exactly.
[02:38:55.830 --> 02:38:58.150]  And Christ said, how many flocks and all that.
[02:38:58.150 --> 02:39:03.189]  And so expanding on that, is it basically like we hear at the end of Revelation, after a
[02:39:03.189 --> 02:39:07.510]  thousand years, Satan is let out and then God rolls up the universe as a scroll.
[02:39:07.510 --> 02:39:08.789]  You're saying that might have happened before.
[02:39:10.230 --> 02:39:14.470]  Yeah, in the sense where God just took everything and threw it in the corner.
[02:39:14.470 --> 02:39:19.029]  And then he created man in his own image.
[02:39:19.029 --> 02:39:24.550]  So, I mean, there's fallen angels, there's also disembodied spirits, which obviously
[02:39:24.550 --> 02:39:25.430]  are held in chains.
[02:39:25.430 --> 02:39:26.230]  And that's so powerful.
[02:39:26.230 --> 02:39:27.350]  And that's right there in the Bible.
[02:39:27.350 --> 02:39:27.830]  Yeah.
[02:39:27.830 --> 02:39:33.109]  So a disembodied spirit seeks to indwell men, and they're very familiar with men because
[02:39:33.109 --> 02:39:35.029]  they're once inhabited man.
[02:39:35.029 --> 02:39:39.430]  So that's why you, if you go around and you reach witch doctors and you actually talk
[02:39:39.430 --> 02:39:43.990]  to them under the demonic power, they say, I've been here, I'm the ancient spirit of
[02:39:43.990 --> 02:39:48.710]  whatever, and I possess this one or whatever, because when a person dies, the spirit leaves
[02:39:48.710 --> 02:39:50.949]  them and goes and finds another host.
[02:39:50.949 --> 02:39:56.390]  So in other words, let's say, and we see that happen with children and their parents,
[02:39:56.390 --> 02:40:01.510]  let's say a father who was tormented most of his life with demonic presence and anger
[02:40:01.510 --> 02:40:06.550]  and the child sitting at the deathbed, but he's not full of the Holy Spirit, but he's
[02:40:06.550 --> 02:40:07.990]  sympathetic to his father.
[02:40:07.990 --> 02:40:11.830]  It's like that the father dies, the spirit comes out of the father, goes right at the
[02:40:11.830 --> 02:40:12.150]  kid.
[02:40:12.150 --> 02:40:15.189]  Then you watch the kid taking on the traits of the father.
[02:40:15.189 --> 02:40:16.230]  How did that happen?
[02:40:16.310 --> 02:40:20.470]  It really was the same spirit that tormented the father is now tormenting the son.
[02:40:20.470 --> 02:40:22.230]  And then, and then that's what the spirit guides stuff.
[02:40:22.230 --> 02:40:25.350]  People get so convinced because it's like it knows all these things have been around.
[02:40:25.350 --> 02:40:26.310]  Well, wow.
[02:40:26.310 --> 02:40:28.630]  And so, and I know that's in the Bible, but you're the expert.
[02:40:29.430 --> 02:40:33.109]  Tell us more about that, that there are these disembodied spirits, not just demons.
[02:40:33.109 --> 02:40:33.430]  Yeah.
[02:40:33.430 --> 02:40:38.310]  So, I mean, even when Saul went to consult a medium, you know, in which, you know, what
[02:40:38.310 --> 02:40:38.869]  happened to him.
[02:40:38.869 --> 02:40:41.830]  And I mean, a lot of preachers say there's not ghost, but then it's right there.
[02:40:41.830 --> 02:40:43.830]  Yeah, they are.
[02:40:43.830 --> 02:40:44.869]  What book is that in, David?
[02:40:45.830 --> 02:40:47.350]  No, it's throughout the scripture.
[02:40:47.350 --> 02:40:49.990]  I mean, there's several, there's several places throughout.
[02:40:49.990 --> 02:40:53.430]  You can read in Kings and, and in Chronicles, I mean, right.
[02:40:53.430 --> 02:40:55.270]  Even Isaiah talks about it.
[02:40:55.270 --> 02:40:56.710]  Jeremiah speaks about it.
[02:40:56.710 --> 02:41:03.510]  So the bottom line is you up against this whole demonic realm of which the disciples
[02:41:03.510 --> 02:41:06.789]  you're saying bad people are, can still be around as a spirit, not until they're putting
[02:41:06.789 --> 02:41:07.270]  the leg apart.
[02:41:07.270 --> 02:41:09.350]  It's not, it's not their spirit.
[02:41:09.350 --> 02:41:11.910]  Their spirit is, is, is incarcerated.
[02:41:11.990 --> 02:41:14.710]  It's the demon that was controlling the person.
[02:41:14.710 --> 02:41:16.470]  Oh, that's familiar with the person.
[02:41:16.470 --> 02:41:17.510]  Oh, so it's like AI.
[02:41:17.510 --> 02:41:18.630]  It's got a copy of you.
[02:41:18.630 --> 02:41:19.270]  It can fool people.
[02:41:19.270 --> 02:41:19.990]  No, no, it's not.
[02:41:19.990 --> 02:41:20.789]  It's not a copy.
[02:41:20.789 --> 02:41:23.510]  It's the spirit that controlled Hitler.
[02:41:23.510 --> 02:41:26.789]  When Hitler died, that spirit, that demon.
[02:41:26.789 --> 02:41:27.350]  Oh, I got it.
[02:41:27.350 --> 02:41:29.670]  So that's why the Bible says there's many in Christ.
[02:41:29.670 --> 02:41:33.270]  Yeah, because they, they look for another person to, to, to enroll.
[02:41:33.270 --> 02:41:33.910]  Now I understand.
[02:41:33.910 --> 02:41:34.150]  Okay.
[02:41:34.150 --> 02:41:37.990]  So basically that's why Christians have to walk in forgiveness.
[02:41:37.990 --> 02:41:42.150]  If you walk in unforgiveness, you can actually open yourself to a demonic spirit that'll
[02:41:42.150 --> 02:41:43.270]  come in and torment you.
[02:41:43.910 --> 02:41:47.029]  So we, that's why we got to close every door.
[02:41:47.029 --> 02:41:49.189]  We, we as Christians can't play games.
[02:41:49.189 --> 02:41:52.710]  You can't play in the terrible territory and then fight him.
[02:41:52.710 --> 02:41:54.710]  You have to close all the doors.
[02:41:54.710 --> 02:41:57.830]  And the only thing we got to realize, we overcome the devil by the blood of the lamb
[02:41:57.830 --> 02:41:59.350]  and the word of our testimony.
[02:41:59.350 --> 02:42:04.150]  And I, and I told you about some prominent people I know off record who were agnostics,
[02:42:04.710 --> 02:42:06.789]  you know, raised Christian, but weren't really sure it was real.
[02:42:06.869 --> 02:42:10.070]  They got demonically attacked and now it's made them, you know, and then only the word
[02:42:10.070 --> 02:42:11.910]  of Jesus and protected them.
[02:42:11.910 --> 02:42:13.189]  That really got their attention.
[02:42:13.189 --> 02:42:17.750]  And I was asking you, why would the devil attack somebody when they were already not,
[02:42:19.430 --> 02:42:21.029]  not really aware and waking him up.
[02:42:21.029 --> 02:42:24.150]  And you said, well, that's because that person and those people were doing good.
[02:42:24.150 --> 02:42:26.710]  So I guess the devil thought he would like scare him into submission or.
[02:42:26.710 --> 02:42:32.390]  Basically, you know, because I think what the devil can see is a calling of God on a
[02:42:32.390 --> 02:42:33.029]  person's life.
[02:42:33.590 --> 02:42:37.590]  So he realizes I better stop this person before he actually finds out the truth, but he always
[02:42:37.590 --> 02:42:39.109]  overplays his hand.
[02:42:39.109 --> 02:42:43.750]  So the bottom line is, you know, that's why Jesus said, I give you power and authority
[02:42:43.750 --> 02:42:48.710]  in my name to lay hands on the sick and cast out devils, which in many cases, people don't
[02:42:48.710 --> 02:42:50.150]  even believe in that anymore.
[02:42:50.150 --> 02:42:55.029]  So the devil comes in and he grabs ahold of people and then he drives them.
[02:42:55.029 --> 02:42:55.830]  He pushes them.
[02:42:55.830 --> 02:42:59.990]  So like when we talk about lust, everybody always thinks it's to do with sex or perversion,
[02:42:59.990 --> 02:43:03.750]  but lust people have a lust for money or power or whatever.
[02:43:03.750 --> 02:43:04.949]  Because somebody said, well, what?
[02:43:04.949 --> 02:43:07.350]  Why would a guy who's worth billions of dollars do that?
[02:43:07.350 --> 02:43:08.949]  It's that it's that spirit of lust.
[02:43:08.949 --> 02:43:11.270]  They always try to use the money to control and hurt people.
[02:43:11.270 --> 02:43:11.990]  Correct.
[02:43:11.990 --> 02:43:13.590]  So they're only wanting the money for the power.
[02:43:14.390 --> 02:43:14.949]  Yeah.
[02:43:14.949 --> 02:43:19.109]  So basically, they're under the control of a demon spirit, which and the Bible is very
[02:43:19.109 --> 02:43:19.590]  plain about.
[02:43:19.590 --> 02:43:22.070]  I mean, even if you go over here to.
[02:43:23.990 --> 02:43:26.470]  And the book of Ephesians is so powerful on this.
[02:43:26.470 --> 02:43:27.670]  Let me just read this to you.
[02:43:28.470 --> 02:43:38.550]  I love this and who knew more about this than Paul, who was the persecutor of the church.
[02:43:39.350 --> 02:43:44.390]  So he says here in Ephesians one, he says, Paul, an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will
[02:43:44.390 --> 02:43:47.990]  of God to the saints, which are in Ephesus, he said, Blessed be the God and father of
[02:43:47.990 --> 02:43:51.350]  the Lord Jesus Christ, who is blessed with all spiritual blessing in heavenly places,
[02:43:51.350 --> 02:43:55.109]  according as he's chosen us in him before the foundation of the world.
[02:43:56.070 --> 02:44:00.390]  So God knew what you, Alex Jones, would be doing in your life before the foundation of
[02:44:00.390 --> 02:44:01.109]  the earth.
[02:44:01.109 --> 02:44:05.270]  I mean, you were born in you had to find out what God had called you to do.
[02:44:05.270 --> 02:44:08.470]  He said that we should be holy without blame before him.
[02:44:08.470 --> 02:44:11.590]  So that's how we close the door on the enemy.
[02:44:11.590 --> 02:44:16.869]  He having predestined us to the adoption of children by Jesus Christ and himself, according
[02:44:16.869 --> 02:44:20.949]  the good pleasure of his will to the praise and glory of his grace, wherein he has made
[02:44:20.949 --> 02:44:25.430]  us to be accepted in the beloved, in whom we have redemption through his blood, the
[02:44:25.430 --> 02:44:30.150]  forgiveness of sins, according to the riches of his grace, wherein he has abounded towards
[02:44:30.150 --> 02:44:34.789]  us in wisdom and prudent, having made known unto us the mystery of his will, according
[02:44:34.789 --> 02:44:39.430]  to his good pleasure, which he has purposed in himself, that in the dispensation of the
[02:44:39.430 --> 02:44:44.630]  fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ, both which are
[02:44:44.630 --> 02:44:50.230]  in heaven and which are in the earth and even in him, in whom we also have obtained an inheritance
[02:44:50.310 --> 02:44:56.310]  being predestined according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel
[02:44:56.310 --> 02:45:01.590]  of his own will, that we should be to the praise and glory who first trusted in Christ,
[02:45:01.590 --> 02:45:06.869]  in whom also ye trusted after you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation,
[02:45:06.869 --> 02:45:11.510]  in whom also you that believed was sealed with the Holy Spirit of promise, which is
[02:45:11.510 --> 02:45:16.550]  the earnest of our inheritance under the redemption of the possession under the praise
[02:45:16.550 --> 02:45:17.350]  of his glory.
[02:45:18.310 --> 02:45:23.350]  He says, Wherefore, I also, after I heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus Christ, ceased
[02:45:23.350 --> 02:45:27.350]  not to give thanks for you, making mention of you my praise, that the God of our Lord
[02:45:27.350 --> 02:45:31.350]  Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and revelation
[02:45:31.350 --> 02:45:35.029]  and knowledge of him, that the eyes of your understanding would be enlightened, that you
[02:45:35.029 --> 02:45:39.350]  may know what is the hope of his calling, what the riches of the glory of his inheritance
[02:45:39.350 --> 02:45:43.430]  and the saints, and what is the exceeding greatness of his power to usher to believe
[02:45:43.430 --> 02:45:46.949]  according to the work of his mighty power, which he wrought in Christ when he raised
[02:45:46.949 --> 02:45:52.390]  him from the dead, set him at his own right hand in heavenly places, far above principality,
[02:45:52.390 --> 02:45:56.869]  power, might, dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also
[02:45:56.869 --> 02:46:01.350]  in the one to come, and hath put all things on his feet, and gave him to be the head of
[02:46:01.350 --> 02:46:05.270]  all things of the church, which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all.
[02:46:05.270 --> 02:46:06.789]  Now watch this now, chapter 2.
[02:46:07.350 --> 02:46:13.109]  You have be quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins, wherein time passed you walked according
[02:46:13.109 --> 02:46:18.150]  to the course of the world, according to the prince of the power of the air, the spirit
[02:46:18.150 --> 02:46:23.590]  that now worketh in the children of disobedience, among whom also we had our conversation, a
[02:46:23.590 --> 02:46:28.390]  man of life, in time passed in the lust of the flesh, fulfilling the desires of the flesh
[02:46:28.390 --> 02:46:32.150]  and of the mind, and were by nature of the children of wrath, even as others.
[02:46:32.150 --> 02:46:37.670]  But God, who is rich in mercy, for his great love, wherewith he loved us, even when we
[02:46:37.670 --> 02:46:42.550]  were dead in sins, he has quickened us together with Christ, made us alive, he does that on
[02:46:42.550 --> 02:46:45.350]  the inside, not up here in our head, but in our heart.
[02:46:45.350 --> 02:46:49.350]  By grace you are saved, and raised us up together, made us sit together in heavenly
[02:46:49.350 --> 02:46:50.789]  places in Christ Jesus.
[02:46:50.789 --> 02:46:55.430]  That's why, even though we're sitting here, but in him, we're seated with him in heavenly
[02:46:55.430 --> 02:46:55.990]  places.
[02:46:55.990 --> 02:47:00.470]  That's why the devil comes after you, because he knows the realm of authority that you have
[02:47:00.470 --> 02:47:01.510]  with the name of Jesus.
[02:47:01.510 --> 02:47:06.949]  It goes on, that in the ages to come, he would show you the riches of his grace and his kindness
[02:47:06.949 --> 02:47:08.310]  to us through Jesus Christ.
[02:47:08.310 --> 02:47:12.070]  For by grace you are saved, through faith, and not of yourselves.
[02:47:12.070 --> 02:47:14.869]  This is a gift of God, not of works, lest any man should boast.
[02:47:14.869 --> 02:47:19.510]  For we are in his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus, under good works, which God
[02:47:19.510 --> 02:47:21.510]  hath before ordained that we should walk in him.
[02:47:21.510 --> 02:47:22.150]  And it goes on.
[02:47:22.150 --> 02:47:23.910]  I have a question about predestination.
[02:47:25.910 --> 02:47:29.109]  Is that saying certain people are, or everybody is, but you have the free will to choose whether
[02:47:29.109 --> 02:47:29.990]  you want to follow God's path?
[02:47:31.430 --> 02:47:35.670]  God has predestined that everyone should get saved, but they get a free will to choose.
[02:47:36.310 --> 02:47:41.350]  Because if we said that God has only chosen certain people, then why would we even preach
[02:47:41.350 --> 02:47:41.830]  the gospel?
[02:47:41.830 --> 02:47:42.550]  No, I mean, I agree.
[02:47:42.550 --> 02:47:43.189]  You know what I mean?
[02:47:43.189 --> 02:47:45.590]  I mean, it's just like, look, you are damned.
[02:47:45.590 --> 02:47:48.070]  Sure, because that never makes, I mean, I get the predestination, but it's like, he
[02:47:48.070 --> 02:47:49.510]  has a plan for you, you've got to accept it.
[02:47:50.630 --> 02:47:53.830]  It's like a military person gets a commission from Congress, they think they're resigning.
[02:47:53.830 --> 02:47:54.470]  Totally.
[02:47:54.470 --> 02:47:59.350]  Because he never forces, like even he gave Adam and Eve free choice, and they chose.
[02:48:00.070 --> 02:48:03.750]  See, he said, don't eat of all the trees you can eat, but don't eat of this tree.
[02:48:03.750 --> 02:48:04.869]  So what is the ultimate sin?
[02:48:04.869 --> 02:48:08.070]  Because the devil always tries to trick you like it's a contract, and then tells Faust
[02:48:08.070 --> 02:48:11.910]  and the archetype that he can't ever revoke it and repent.
[02:48:11.910 --> 02:48:17.189]  But then we have the two people beside Christ on the cross, one accepts and the other doesn't.
[02:48:17.189 --> 02:48:20.869]  I mean, so we're showed that right to the last minute you can do it, or when does it
[02:48:20.869 --> 02:48:21.510]  go too far?
[02:48:21.510 --> 02:48:24.390]  I mean, could a Bill Gates, who's obviously demon possessed.
[02:48:24.390 --> 02:48:26.230]  Yeah, yeah, anybody could get saved.
[02:48:26.230 --> 02:48:32.310]  So I remember, I remember the night they were executing Saddam Hussein, because one of my
[02:48:32.310 --> 02:48:36.630]  congregation called me on my phone, it was like 1115 on a Sunday night, I was driving
[02:48:36.630 --> 02:48:37.270]  home.
[02:48:37.270 --> 02:48:42.789]  And the lady said to me, Pastor, if Saddam cried out to Jesus, would the Lord save him?
[02:48:42.789 --> 02:48:43.830]  And I actually began to weep.
[02:48:43.830 --> 02:48:47.109]  I said, yes, whoever calls in the name of the Lord shall be saved.
[02:48:47.109 --> 02:48:48.310]  So can people now?
[02:48:48.310 --> 02:48:49.750]  Now people say, oh, that's terrible.
[02:48:49.750 --> 02:48:50.789]  He should go to hell.
[02:48:50.789 --> 02:48:52.789]  And but we would condemn everybody to hell.
[02:48:52.789 --> 02:48:57.590]  But the way God is, as long as people are alive and breathing, if they would call in
[02:48:57.590 --> 02:48:58.949]  the name of the Lord, they will be saved.
[02:48:58.949 --> 02:49:00.230]  That's the grace of God.
[02:49:00.230 --> 02:49:03.510]  And so why was David a man after God's own heart when he did a lot of bad things?
[02:49:03.510 --> 02:49:05.990]  Was it because he legitimately repented and God knew that?
[02:49:05.990 --> 02:49:09.510]  Yeah, because that's the way he was.
[02:49:09.510 --> 02:49:16.070]  He started off as a worshiper and he became king and then became distracted with his kingship
[02:49:16.070 --> 02:49:17.750]  and forgot to worship God.
[02:49:17.750 --> 02:49:20.470]  And that's where the door opened for his demise.
[02:49:20.470 --> 02:49:23.910]  You know, but but he did repent and call out to the Lord.
[02:49:23.910 --> 02:49:29.750]  So the answer is you constantly be repenting to make sure we're not swaying back over there.
[02:49:29.750 --> 02:49:31.990]  Well, and but then also put guards up around.
[02:49:31.990 --> 02:49:35.109]  I become be accountable, you know, have friends and say, hey, you're not doing that.
[02:49:35.109 --> 02:49:35.670]  Come on.
[02:49:35.670 --> 02:49:37.430]  We're not going there or whatever.
[02:49:37.430 --> 02:49:41.990]  So I tell people you've got to hang with strong people and then we've got to be accountable,
[02:49:41.990 --> 02:49:42.550]  you know, to.
[02:49:42.550 --> 02:49:45.990]  Well, let's talk about the Great Awakening, because you've been saying that's coming
[02:49:45.990 --> 02:49:49.109]  for twenty five, thirty years or thirty years.
[02:49:49.109 --> 02:49:50.230]  So let's expand on that.
[02:49:51.109 --> 02:49:55.029]  Young people in all the polls are like seventy five percent and abortion now.
[02:49:55.910 --> 02:49:58.230]  Thirty years ago, they were seventy five percent for it.
[02:49:58.230 --> 02:50:02.310]  All the numbers show that in young people, the biggest numbers are becoming conservative
[02:50:02.310 --> 02:50:03.189]  and Christian.
[02:50:03.189 --> 02:50:06.789]  There is a revival, but the media is trying to block that understanding.
[02:50:06.789 --> 02:50:09.590]  And I think that's why they shut down the churches, not just around the world,
[02:50:09.590 --> 02:50:14.310]  trying to break the back of a big awakening that they realize is here and is about to
[02:50:14.310 --> 02:50:14.949]  explode.
[02:50:14.949 --> 02:50:18.550]  I mean, obviously, the Great Awakening is here, but how would you describe it on its
[02:50:18.550 --> 02:50:19.110]  timeline?
[02:50:19.110 --> 02:50:20.710]  What's your intellectual view on that?
[02:50:20.710 --> 02:50:22.470]  And spiritually, what's the Holy Ghost telling you?
[02:50:22.470 --> 02:50:27.990]  I think my wife actually, as she talks about this, you know, we watch like if you watch
[02:50:27.990 --> 02:50:32.630]  the kids of the generation of Woodstock, it's like those kids are rebelling against
[02:50:32.630 --> 02:50:33.110]  their parents.
[02:50:33.110 --> 02:50:33.990]  They don't want that.
[02:50:33.990 --> 02:50:39.270]  So it's almost like they're coming back in some ways conservative because it's like
[02:50:39.270 --> 02:50:40.789]  a counterculture.
[02:50:40.789 --> 02:50:43.670]  And it's the same way with the people that have not been serving God.
[02:50:44.470 --> 02:50:49.510]  And I think the lockdowns of twenty, twenty, twenty, twenty one was actually the dumbest
[02:50:49.510 --> 02:50:51.029]  thing the devil could do because people.
[02:50:51.910 --> 02:50:55.189]  It's a repeat of the devil can't help but attack, but he is an omnipresent.
[02:50:55.189 --> 02:50:58.630]  So he didn't or he's too arrogant to like think that is going to backfire, which he
[02:50:58.630 --> 02:50:59.029]  did.
[02:50:59.029 --> 02:51:00.150]  It was meant to break the church.
[02:51:00.150 --> 02:51:01.029]  It said it's making it better.
[02:51:01.029 --> 02:51:02.230]  Everybody started searching.
[02:51:02.230 --> 02:51:03.830]  They were always searching.
[02:51:03.830 --> 02:51:06.550]  And because the only thing you could access was your phone.
[02:51:06.550 --> 02:51:08.789]  Remember, that's why they wanted to shut the Internet down.
[02:51:08.789 --> 02:51:12.150]  Remember, we're talking about pulling the plug on the Internet because they didn't want
[02:51:12.150 --> 02:51:12.630]  information.
[02:51:12.630 --> 02:51:15.189]  Well, now they're saying because the cyber attackers are going to use it.
[02:51:15.189 --> 02:51:18.230]  So when the power grid starts having problems, we've got to kick you, everybody off the web
[02:51:18.230 --> 02:51:21.510]  for a few months so they can just brainwash us via mainstream news.
[02:51:21.510 --> 02:51:22.710]  I don't see that working either.
[02:51:22.710 --> 02:51:24.789]  I don't see how they put the genie back in the bottle.
[02:51:24.789 --> 02:51:27.270]  And that's why the devil is going to get outright more authoritarian.
[02:51:27.270 --> 02:51:30.550]  Well, what I feel that they overshot themselves.
[02:51:30.550 --> 02:51:36.230]  So basically, because all of these guys saw us and they all getting so old now, they
[02:51:36.230 --> 02:51:37.910]  want to see it happen in their lifetime.
[02:51:37.910 --> 02:51:40.710]  Even the Clintons, they want everything to happen in their lifetime.
[02:51:40.710 --> 02:51:44.310]  But God is the one that actually says where the end is not them.
[02:51:44.310 --> 02:51:48.630]  The devil is not the one that dictates when things are going to happen.
[02:51:48.630 --> 02:51:50.949]  God is the one that dictates when things are going to happen.
[02:51:50.949 --> 02:51:56.789]  So basically, I mean, otherwise, you and I wouldn't be sitting here in this way.
[02:51:57.430 --> 02:51:58.470]  Evil is not all powerful.
[02:51:58.470 --> 02:52:04.070]  And when we stand with God and in the name of Jesus Christ, the son, we have the authority.
[02:52:04.070 --> 02:52:05.189]  And that's a dream I have.
[02:52:05.189 --> 02:52:08.390]  And I've had a lot of dreams that come true.
[02:52:08.390 --> 02:52:09.990]  And sometimes it'll be the silliest thing.
[02:52:09.990 --> 02:52:11.510]  Sometimes it'll be like getting mugged or something.
[02:52:11.510 --> 02:52:13.189]  And like a year later, oh, my gosh, this is a dream.
[02:52:13.189 --> 02:52:14.230]  I even wrote some of this down.
[02:52:15.830 --> 02:52:19.270]  But I've had dreams last three years where I would pray, God, I know you're real.
[02:52:19.270 --> 02:52:20.550]  And I've seen you in my life.
[02:52:20.550 --> 02:52:21.990]  Will you give me some peace?
[02:52:21.990 --> 02:52:24.230]  Because the Holy Spirit told me, don't put it on your shoulders.
[02:52:24.230 --> 02:52:25.270]  It's going to kill you.
[02:52:25.270 --> 02:52:28.550]  And because it's God, you got to give it to God, but work hard.
[02:52:29.510 --> 02:52:33.670]  So I've had these dreams that it's indescribably heaven.
[02:52:33.670 --> 02:52:35.830]  OK, just unbelievably gorgeous.
[02:52:35.830 --> 02:52:37.270]  Everything is so beautiful.
[02:52:37.270 --> 02:52:39.029]  It's like a thousand times Hawaii.
[02:52:39.590 --> 02:52:42.630]  But then I could stare into any time, space.
[02:52:42.630 --> 02:52:45.189]  It was just in these dreams where it's total completion.
[02:52:45.189 --> 02:52:47.029]  You know you're in the presence of God.
[02:52:47.029 --> 02:52:49.349]  You can feel the angels there, but you don't really see them.
[02:52:49.349 --> 02:52:50.150]  You don't want to look.
[02:52:50.150 --> 02:52:51.590]  You're like almost ashamed.
[02:52:51.590 --> 02:52:53.910]  And you're in total peace, total completion.
[02:52:54.550 --> 02:52:59.430]  And then God's like, well, you understand that humans see things as like dimensions.
[02:52:59.430 --> 02:53:02.949]  And then that's real, but more complex than what your mind can comprehend.
[02:53:02.949 --> 02:53:07.189]  But you have a spirit that's already in heaven, already with us.
[02:53:07.189 --> 02:53:10.789]  And that your third dimensional manifestation is like a footprint of sand.
[02:53:10.789 --> 02:53:12.070]  And that's all.
[02:53:12.070 --> 02:53:15.510]  And you need to understand that that's why you need to be in total comfort.
[02:53:15.510 --> 02:53:18.710]  And in my spirit, I felt like 30 years younger.
[02:53:18.710 --> 02:53:20.390]  I only had like three of those dreams.
[02:53:20.390 --> 02:53:21.510]  And it was like, I want to stay here.
[02:53:21.510 --> 02:53:23.189]  It's like, no, you already are here.
[02:53:23.189 --> 02:53:24.630]  But you've got to go do this mission.
[02:53:24.630 --> 02:53:26.550]  And you've got to clean yourself up.
[02:53:26.550 --> 02:53:29.029]  You've got to get yourself together because we got really important.
[02:53:29.029 --> 02:53:29.990]  That's what it is.
[02:53:29.990 --> 02:53:33.270]  And I'm telling you, I couldn't imagine eternity because there would be no time.
[02:53:33.270 --> 02:53:37.110]  You're just like it's beyond ecstasy, beyond anything.
[02:53:37.110 --> 02:53:38.230]  I've tried to explain to listeners.
[02:53:38.230 --> 02:53:43.670]  It's this total completion, total satisfaction, just like, and you say you experience that
[02:53:43.670 --> 02:53:44.390]  all the time.
[02:53:44.390 --> 02:53:47.430]  I mean, just talking about it, I feel a little bit of it, but we're talking so intense.
[02:53:47.430 --> 02:53:51.830]  We do in the meetings, I call our meetings a bit of heaven on earth.
[02:53:51.830 --> 02:53:55.110]  You know, and people get joy and stuff, which a lot of the people out there hate joy.
[02:53:55.110 --> 02:53:58.789]  But I mean, I don't know what they're going to do when you look at Pentecost and all
[02:53:58.789 --> 02:53:58.869]  that.
[02:53:58.869 --> 02:53:59.510]  We're supposed to have that.
[02:53:59.510 --> 02:54:02.470]  So what about the Christians who I'm not judging because I'm not certainly part of
[02:54:02.470 --> 02:54:04.630]  myself, but they think we're all supposed to be miserable and unhappy.
[02:54:04.630 --> 02:54:06.070]  But the Holy Spirit makes me feel good.
[02:54:06.070 --> 02:54:07.750]  Well, the gospel means good news.
[02:54:08.470 --> 02:54:10.070]  The gospel never means bad news.
[02:54:10.070 --> 02:54:12.470]  So yeah, the Bible says.
[02:54:14.550 --> 02:54:19.430]  Repent and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and you'll receive the
[02:54:19.430 --> 02:54:21.430]  gift of the Holy Spirit.
[02:54:21.990 --> 02:54:28.390]  And so we go preach the gospel and we're not to go condemn people because they already
[02:54:28.390 --> 02:54:30.789]  condemned if they reject the gospel.
[02:54:30.789 --> 02:54:34.710]  But the moment they receive the gospel, then they receive eternal life.
[02:54:34.710 --> 02:54:41.670]  And so that's why he sent him out with joy two by two to go preach the gospel, the glad
[02:54:41.670 --> 02:54:45.830]  tidings, the good news, and people went walking and leaping and praising God.
[02:54:45.830 --> 02:54:47.349]  So what does that dream sound like to you?
[02:54:47.349 --> 02:54:49.910]  Because I mean, I know these dreams are not a thing in my brain.
[02:54:49.910 --> 02:54:51.029]  I know the dreams that are real.
[02:54:51.029 --> 02:54:54.869]  Yeah, I believe the Lord's letting you get a little insight into what heaven is going
[02:54:54.869 --> 02:54:55.430]  to be like.
[02:54:56.470 --> 02:54:57.590]  You wouldn't want to come back.
[02:54:57.590 --> 02:54:59.029]  Why would you want to come back to this?
[02:54:59.990 --> 02:55:02.789]  That's why we've got a job or work to do.
[02:55:03.430 --> 02:55:07.029]  And then we'd go home to be with the Lord when we finish running our race.
[02:55:07.029 --> 02:55:08.869]  But I was going off your description from the Bible.
[02:55:08.869 --> 02:55:13.189]  I mean, does that sound accurate the way I said it or that you said our spirits are actually
[02:55:13.189 --> 02:55:13.670]  with God?
[02:55:14.390 --> 02:55:18.150]  Well, it's the Holy Spirit that has joined us together with God.
[02:55:18.869 --> 02:55:20.310]  So it's like a connection.
[02:55:21.110 --> 02:55:25.990]  Well, the Holy Spirit comes to live on the inside of us, and then we are one with him,
[02:55:25.990 --> 02:55:27.510]  even though we're living down here.
[02:55:27.830 --> 02:55:33.270]  So obviously, that's why when we get into his word and we get into his presence that
[02:55:33.270 --> 02:55:35.029]  he there's a quickening that takes place.
[02:55:35.029 --> 02:55:38.230]  That's why I get people in the meetings to get them under the anointing.
[02:55:38.230 --> 02:55:40.230]  I've got to get the people under the presence of God.
[02:55:40.230 --> 02:55:44.230]  And in many religious circles, there is no opportunity for people to do that.
[02:55:44.230 --> 02:55:45.830]  And that's just like in science.
[02:55:45.830 --> 02:55:47.590]  We know everything is being proven.
[02:55:47.590 --> 02:55:49.830]  You know what the Bible says is really the science.
[02:55:49.830 --> 02:55:50.869]  I mean, it's a fact.
[02:55:50.869 --> 02:55:52.710]  It's like with a microwave relay tower.
[02:55:52.710 --> 02:55:55.189]  It's going off nowhere till you align it with the 150 miles away.
[02:55:55.990 --> 02:55:57.910]  And now they're now they're connected.
[02:55:57.910 --> 02:55:59.189]  Basically, that's what's happening.
[02:55:59.189 --> 02:56:01.110]  And then people are aiming a satellite satellite.
[02:56:01.910 --> 02:56:03.029]  So people get saved.
[02:56:03.029 --> 02:56:03.750]  They get healed.
[02:56:03.750 --> 02:56:08.310]  They get delivered from anything that's bothering them from fear, bondage, addictions,
[02:56:08.310 --> 02:56:09.750]  any whatever it is.
[02:56:09.750 --> 02:56:11.270]  And the Lord sets them free.
[02:56:11.270 --> 02:56:13.029]  And then they get peace in their heart.
[02:56:13.590 --> 02:56:17.910]  And so then you have to renew your mind to the word of God and keep the doors closed.
[02:56:17.910 --> 02:56:22.230]  You don't allow the enemy back in because, you know, the house is clean.
[02:56:22.230 --> 02:56:23.029]  It's not filled.
[02:56:23.029 --> 02:56:25.270]  The enemy comes back seven times worse.
[02:56:25.270 --> 02:56:27.189]  And the Bible speaks about that in the gospel.
[02:56:27.189 --> 02:56:27.910]  Wow.
[02:56:27.910 --> 02:56:32.070]  So that's why we've got to get everybody saved and baptized in the Holy Spirit,
[02:56:32.070 --> 02:56:33.510]  which is very, very important.
[02:56:33.510 --> 02:56:35.750]  Jesus is the one that instituted that.
[02:56:35.750 --> 02:56:36.550]  Absolutely.
[02:56:36.550 --> 02:56:37.270]  Yeah.
[02:56:37.270 --> 02:56:37.830]  Powerful.
[02:56:37.830 --> 02:56:39.510]  We're going to end this hour.
[02:56:39.510 --> 02:56:44.230]  We have the guest host taking over in the fourth hour.
[02:56:44.230 --> 02:56:45.830]  And I forget who the great guest host is today.
[02:56:45.830 --> 02:56:46.869]  I know it's Jay Dyer tomorrow.
[02:56:48.230 --> 02:56:49.670]  Oh, I love Drew Hernandez.
[02:56:49.670 --> 02:56:50.550]  Talk about a preacher.
[02:56:50.550 --> 02:56:52.470]  You ought to you ought to carry this next hour.
[02:56:52.470 --> 02:56:54.230]  It's pretty fire and brimstone.
[02:56:54.230 --> 02:56:56.150]  But he's been a youth minister and stuff.
[02:56:56.150 --> 02:56:59.270]  He's a very popular TPUSA reporter.
[02:56:59.270 --> 02:57:01.670]  And I mean, he goes out and his reports get like 50 million views.
[02:57:01.670 --> 02:57:02.710]  Can I say one thing?
[02:57:02.710 --> 02:57:03.029]  Absolutely.
[02:57:03.029 --> 02:57:03.349]  Go ahead.
[02:57:03.349 --> 02:57:07.189]  OK, so if you're watching right now and you don't know Jesus, why don't you invite him
[02:57:07.189 --> 02:57:10.070]  into your heart right now and just pray this off to me?
[02:57:10.070 --> 02:57:12.869]  Say, dear Lord Jesus, come into my heart.
[02:57:13.670 --> 02:57:14.789]  Forgive me of my sin.
[02:57:15.670 --> 02:57:17.029]  Wash me in your blood.
[02:57:17.910 --> 02:57:21.270]  Thank you that you went to Calvary for me and you died for me.
[02:57:21.990 --> 02:57:23.750]  And you shed your blood for me.
[02:57:23.750 --> 02:57:26.789]  And today I confess you as my Lord and my savior.
[02:57:27.750 --> 02:57:30.630]  And I believe that you rose from the dead for me.
[02:57:30.630 --> 02:57:33.270]  And one day you're coming back again for me.
[02:57:34.230 --> 02:57:36.150]  Fill me with the Holy Spirit.
[02:57:36.150 --> 02:57:39.670]  Give me a hunger for the God's word and for the things of God.
[02:57:40.310 --> 02:57:43.590]  And give me a holy boldness to preach the gospel.
[02:57:44.310 --> 02:57:46.310]  And from this day, I'm saved.
[02:57:47.590 --> 02:57:49.270]  Two amazing new tropics.
[02:57:49.270 --> 02:57:53.910]  That means brain power are back in stock at InfoWarsTour.com.

[02:58:39.110 --> 02:58:42.390]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[02:58:42.390 --> 02:58:44.789]  And the answer for energy is Brain Force.
[02:58:45.510 --> 02:58:49.349]  You're going to want to pay attention to what I'm about to say in the next 60 seconds.
[02:58:49.910 --> 02:58:55.029]  Two new incredible products are now available exclusively at InfoWarsTour.com.
[02:58:55.029 --> 02:59:00.310]  They are both clones of national best-selling products from a major pharmaceutical slash
[02:59:00.310 --> 02:59:05.110]  supplement maker that are listeners and patriots that are allowing us to private label it at
[02:59:05.110 --> 02:59:07.510]  a lower price you'll find in stores.
[02:59:07.510 --> 02:59:10.949]  It's Joint Relief Max and Nerve Renew.
[02:59:10.949 --> 02:59:17.189]  Both of these have known documented natural compounds to lower pain and to also make your
[02:59:17.189 --> 02:59:22.949]  nerves healthier, which is one of the major reasons nerves get irritated and are more inductive
[02:59:22.949 --> 02:59:23.990]  to pain.
[02:59:23.990 --> 02:59:26.150]  There's major research behind this all.
[02:59:26.150 --> 02:59:33.349]  You need to get Joint Relief Max from InfoWarsMD and Nerve Renew from InfoWarsMD exclusively

[02:59:51.189 --> 02:59:55.189]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[03:00:05.110 --> 03:00:06.310]  All right, it's the final segment.
[03:00:06.310 --> 03:00:10.070]  We're doing an extra segment here and the great Drew Hernandez is taking over for the
[03:00:10.070 --> 03:00:11.029]  rest of the hour.
[03:00:11.029 --> 03:00:15.670]  If your stations don't carry, you can find us all at InfoWars.com and Band.Video and I'm
[03:00:15.670 --> 03:00:17.750]  on the air 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central every day.
[03:00:17.750 --> 03:00:19.590]  We have other shows at InfoWars.com.
[03:00:19.590 --> 03:00:24.230]  I really want all of you as listeners to go check out Revival.com and the amazing ministry
[03:00:24.230 --> 03:00:26.150]  of Pastor Rodney Howard Brown.
[03:00:26.150 --> 03:00:32.789]  I'm going to be at his Sunday services watching them this weekend and this Sunday at 9.30
[03:00:32.789 --> 03:00:36.070]  when it starts and I'll also be back at 7 o'clock at night for an evening with Alex
[03:00:36.070 --> 03:00:38.710]  Jones that he decided to set up and beam out on all the satellites.
[03:00:38.710 --> 03:00:40.869]  But Rodney, we have hard breaks with satellites.
[03:00:40.869 --> 03:00:41.590]  I didn't hear the music.
[03:00:41.590 --> 03:00:42.470]  I apologize.
[03:00:42.470 --> 03:00:47.670]  Your amen got cut off and so just you still said here's the prayer went out, but say one
[03:00:47.670 --> 03:00:48.789]  more prayer for folks.
[03:00:48.789 --> 03:00:53.110]  Basically, if you prayed that prayer with us, then that means you gave your life to the
[03:00:53.110 --> 03:00:58.150]  Lord Jesus and I want you to find a church that believes the whole Bible, not picks and
[03:00:58.150 --> 03:01:02.470]  chooses, and believes that Jesus saves, heals, sets free, delivers.
[03:01:02.470 --> 03:01:03.830]  They don't believe in lockdowns.
[03:01:03.830 --> 03:01:07.189]  They don't believe in closing the church and they believe that Jesus is coming very
[03:01:07.189 --> 03:01:10.310]  soon and then go to my website Revival.com.
[03:01:10.310 --> 03:01:11.510]  We've got soul winning tools.
[03:01:11.510 --> 03:01:15.349]  It'll tell you how to win souls, how to lead people to Jesus because that's what we have
[03:01:15.349 --> 03:01:17.430]  to do to obey the Great Commission.
[03:01:17.430 --> 03:01:18.869]  Sunday morning is going to be great.
[03:01:18.869 --> 03:01:23.189]  Before the service, Alex and I are going to be riding around the lobby of a big pavilion
[03:01:23.189 --> 03:01:27.430]  and then you can actually get to meet him and it's just going to be great.
[03:01:27.430 --> 03:01:28.789]  Sunday morning is going to be awesome.
[03:01:28.789 --> 03:01:29.990]  It's called the main event.
[03:01:29.990 --> 03:01:33.750]  Alex will get up and greet the people on Sunday morning and then Sunday night is going to
[03:01:33.750 --> 03:01:34.550]  be a night with Alex.
[03:01:34.550 --> 03:01:35.590]  It's going to be phenomenal.
[03:01:35.590 --> 03:01:39.910]  So you just need to get your Revival.com, tell you exactly where it is.
[03:01:39.910 --> 03:01:41.670]  You will have to register to come.
[03:01:41.670 --> 03:01:45.590]  It's free and you'll have to show an ID and we have very tight security.
[03:01:45.590 --> 03:01:46.949]  So I'll just let you know.
[03:01:46.949 --> 03:01:51.270]  That's how we've been running this church and we've been over 1100 nights in what's
[03:01:51.270 --> 03:01:55.750]  called the stand that takes place every night because when they shut us down, we said we're
[03:01:55.750 --> 03:01:59.349]  never closing and we'll go every night and we're broadcasting around the world.
[03:01:59.349 --> 03:02:01.510]  So you tripled down when they arrested you?
[03:02:01.510 --> 03:02:03.590]  Yeah, because that would be the thing.
[03:02:03.590 --> 03:02:09.430]  If we just went back to Sunday mornings, if they want to lock you down, you just went
[03:02:09.430 --> 03:02:11.510]  back to Sunday morning, but we're going every night.
[03:02:11.510 --> 03:02:15.270]  Haven't you been vindicated as the first preacher to get arrested, the biggest preacher
[03:02:15.270 --> 03:02:15.910]  to be arrested?
[03:02:16.630 --> 03:02:17.990]  They knew they made it in a lab.
[03:02:17.990 --> 03:02:19.510]  They knew they blocked therapeutics.
[03:02:19.510 --> 03:02:21.750]  They knew the vaccine wasn't a vaccine, didn't work.
[03:02:21.750 --> 03:02:25.510]  You have been totally vindicated for the international attacks you went under and everything.
[03:02:25.510 --> 03:02:28.550]  You have the courage and that's why I love you is because you have courage.
[03:02:28.550 --> 03:02:29.910]  All the charges were dropped.
[03:02:31.510 --> 03:02:32.630]  My record was suspended.
[03:02:32.630 --> 03:02:36.150]  Well, it's a blessing because that got international attention and then other churches started
[03:02:36.150 --> 03:02:36.789]  standing up.
[03:02:36.789 --> 03:02:37.289]  Sure.
[03:02:38.310 --> 03:02:39.110]  Totally.
[03:02:39.110 --> 03:02:43.029]  But Sunday is going to be phenomenal and I'm just honored to have you here.
[03:02:43.029 --> 03:02:44.150]  Well, I'm glad you invited me.
[03:02:44.150 --> 03:02:47.590]  You've invited me before, but this time I was able to do it.
[03:02:48.310 --> 03:02:50.070]  And when I said I'm going to move to Florida, I don't know if I'm going to move around
[03:02:50.070 --> 03:02:55.590]  Tampa or Sarasota or whatever, but I do intend to try to move at least a big part of the
[03:02:55.590 --> 03:02:58.230]  operation to Florida because it's just beautiful.
[03:02:58.230 --> 03:02:59.590]  Especially here on the West Coast.
[03:02:59.590 --> 03:03:00.630]  You know, we got to free that.
[03:03:00.630 --> 03:03:01.990]  We got to free parts of the East Coast.
[03:03:03.430 --> 03:03:05.029]  But Texas is really following the Democrats.
[03:03:05.029 --> 03:03:06.630]  I want Republicans to know we're losing the state.
[03:03:07.990 --> 03:03:08.949]  I'm not running Texas down.
[03:03:08.949 --> 03:03:10.390]  As people want to know, I mean, we're losing it.
[03:03:11.270 --> 03:03:16.070]  Well, it's hard for a Texan to ever say something like that because if you know the
[03:03:16.070 --> 03:03:18.310]  Texans like I do, there's only one country.
[03:03:18.310 --> 03:03:18.949]  It's called Texas.
[03:03:18.949 --> 03:03:21.990]  But see, that's I mean, my family on both sides founded the state.
[03:03:21.990 --> 03:03:23.830]  I'm not going to get into all that because I don't live off my ancestors.
[03:03:24.230 --> 03:03:27.029]  The founders, on record, raised Colonel Travis's son.
[03:03:27.029 --> 03:03:28.310]  My mom's side, whole nine yards.
[03:03:28.310 --> 03:03:29.910]  Dad's side, in it, whole deal.
[03:03:29.910 --> 03:03:31.750]  1820s, Mexican land grants.
[03:03:31.750 --> 03:03:36.789]  We still have property we bought from the Mexican government in East Texas, thousands
[03:03:36.789 --> 03:03:37.430]  of acres.
[03:03:37.430 --> 03:03:41.910]  And so I want Texas to know the state has been completely overrun by leftists.
[03:03:41.910 --> 03:03:43.349]  They've taken all the major cities.
[03:03:43.349 --> 03:03:44.630]  And I'm not even saying Florida's great.
[03:03:44.630 --> 03:03:46.070]  It's just beautiful, good people.
[03:03:47.590 --> 03:03:50.710]  I cannot be in jurisdictions run by the Democratic Party anymore.
[03:03:50.710 --> 03:03:56.630]  So wherever I end up moving, and I'm really serious about Florida, at least main operations
[03:03:56.630 --> 03:03:59.270]  is because you cannot be under these short sorrows.
[03:03:59.270 --> 03:04:00.230]  People, they've got the courts.
[03:04:00.230 --> 03:04:00.869]  They've got it all.
[03:04:00.869 --> 03:04:01.990]  The country's in trouble.
[03:04:01.990 --> 03:04:03.029]  But it's a process.
[03:04:03.029 --> 03:04:04.550]  Texans are always like, they'll never get us.
[03:04:04.550 --> 03:04:05.110]  They'll never.
[03:04:05.110 --> 03:04:07.189]  We're this close to the state going down.
[03:04:08.310 --> 03:04:11.029]  And if you lost DeSantis as governor, this state could be lost.
[03:04:11.590 --> 03:04:13.590]  These people engage in election fraud, folks.
[03:04:14.150 --> 03:04:17.830]  All right, Revival.com, Revival.com, the river in Tampa.
[03:04:17.830 --> 03:04:20.550]  Everybody better load up like the Beverly Hillbillies and get here.
[03:04:20.949 --> 03:04:23.349]  And you can see thousands and thousands.
[03:04:23.349 --> 03:04:25.670]  So nobody's going to be turned away as long as they're not a criminal.
[03:04:25.670 --> 03:04:29.590]  And when you come, when we do that night, we're going to have people line up to ask
[03:04:29.590 --> 03:04:30.710]  Alex questions.
[03:04:30.710 --> 03:04:32.150]  And obviously, there'll be a cutoff point.
[03:04:32.150 --> 03:04:34.150]  Otherwise, it'll be to 2 o'clock in the morning.
[03:04:34.150 --> 03:04:35.990]  But it's going to be a fun night.
[03:04:35.990 --> 03:04:37.750]  I'm going to have our worship.
[03:04:37.750 --> 03:04:39.590]  We go to our orchestra here.
[03:04:39.590 --> 03:04:42.150]  I'm going to receive the offering from the ministry that night.
[03:04:42.150 --> 03:04:45.510]  And then after that, I will say goodbye to my YouTube and my Facebook.
[03:04:45.510 --> 03:04:49.750]  But we'll be live on satellite and all the streaming platforms that we are on, which we'll
[03:04:49.750 --> 03:04:51.510]  tell you about at that time.
[03:04:51.510 --> 03:04:53.029]  And then we'll have fun.
[03:04:53.029 --> 03:04:53.349]  All right.
[03:04:53.349 --> 03:04:53.910]  God bless you.
[03:04:53.910 --> 03:04:54.310]  Thank you.
[03:04:54.310 --> 03:04:55.029]  Pastor, give me a hug.
[03:04:58.070 --> 03:05:02.310]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and War for the World, is a historic
[03:05:02.310 --> 03:05:06.310]  book that documents the globalist in their own words, plan for our future.
[03:05:06.310 --> 03:05:07.750]  That is a hellish future.
[03:05:07.750 --> 03:05:11.270]  Now, you'll always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[03:05:11.270 --> 03:05:15.349]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and War for the World at bookstores,
[03:05:15.349 --> 03:05:17.110]  Amazon or Infowarshore.com.
[03:05:17.110 --> 03:05:21.510]  But you will never be able to get another signed copy of the book after the signed copies
[03:05:21.510 --> 03:05:22.710]  we got run out.
[03:05:22.710 --> 03:05:25.270]  And there's about a thousand left of them right now.
[03:05:25.270 --> 03:05:30.710]  So get your copy of The Great Reset and the War for the World, a signed copy at Infowarshore.com.
[03:05:30.710 --> 03:05:34.630]  And there is a markup there because this is a fundraiser to keep us on the air.
[03:05:34.630 --> 03:05:37.670]  So you won't just have this historic memento and this powerful book.
[03:05:37.670 --> 03:05:40.470]  You'll also know that you help keep Infowars on the air.
[03:05:40.470 --> 03:05:44.390]  I want to thank those of you that have gotten signed copies of the book or unsigned copies.
[03:05:44.390 --> 03:05:49.510]  But I want to encourage all of you who haven't yet to go to Infowarshore.com and get a signed
[03:05:49.510 --> 03:05:53.990]  copy and buy a couple of unsigned copies and donate to the library or give them to the
[03:05:53.990 --> 03:05:54.789]  local school.
[03:05:54.789 --> 03:05:55.830]  This is an Infowar.
[03:05:55.830 --> 03:05:57.590]  I'm counting on you and thank you for your support.
[03:06:04.470 --> 03:06:10.150]  Well, ladies and gentlemen, Infowarriors worldwide, you are now engaged in the Infowar.
[03:06:10.150 --> 03:06:16.630]  Welcome to the fourth hour of the most infamous, according to the eyes of the globalist, infamous,
[03:06:16.630 --> 03:06:19.270]  most banned transmission on the face of planet Earth.
[03:06:19.270 --> 03:06:21.189]  The Alex Jones Show, fourth hour.
[03:06:21.189 --> 03:06:23.670]  I am your guest host, Drew Hernandez.
[03:06:23.670 --> 03:06:27.510]  I want to say shout out to all the base Infowarriors and thought criminals out there.
[03:06:27.510 --> 03:06:28.630]  Thank you guys for tuning in.
[03:06:28.630 --> 03:06:33.270]  Make sure wherever you're watching this and if you're watching it on Getter, Rumble, Infowars.com,
[03:06:33.270 --> 03:06:36.710]  Band.Video, wherever it may be, get these transmissions out.
[03:06:36.710 --> 03:06:37.830]  Get these links out.
[03:06:37.830 --> 03:06:41.990]  It is imperative that we get this information out, especially when we're talking gospel.
[03:06:41.990 --> 03:06:42.869]  We're talking Christ.
[03:06:42.869 --> 03:06:47.430]  We're talking things of eternity where people are looking for answers because there are a
[03:06:47.430 --> 03:06:53.910]  lot of question marks with humanity living in total darkness, not having any path forward,
[03:06:53.910 --> 03:06:58.949]  not having any understanding of why the things are taking place right before their very eyes.
[03:06:59.590 --> 03:07:05.670]  Christ is the light of the world and we are to let our lights so shine so people can see
[03:07:05.670 --> 03:07:08.310]  for themselves just exactly what's going on around them.
[03:07:08.310 --> 03:07:13.510]  Everybody knows that something evil is going on, whether you look left, whether you look right,
[03:07:13.510 --> 03:07:17.270]  whether you look up, whether you look down, it's all around you.
[03:07:17.270 --> 03:07:21.349]  And if there is an obvious, you know, this is kind of how I came to Christ.
[03:07:22.150 --> 03:07:31.590]  If there's an obvious, an obvious awareness, okay, manifestations and reality of the devil,
[03:07:31.590 --> 03:07:41.430]  demons, spiritual entities that interface with humans to push them forward in terms of success
[03:07:41.430 --> 03:07:48.310]  for humanity, whether it be wealth, fame, fortune, stature, you name it, whether it be that or
[03:07:48.310 --> 03:07:54.789]  whether it be like you see in the Bible, demonic possessions, people that are oppressed by satanic
[03:07:54.789 --> 03:08:01.670]  evil demons and entities that attempt to torment mankind and push them further and further and
[03:08:01.670 --> 03:08:09.990]  further away from God, miserable, isolated, alone, afraid, sometimes, most of the time,
[03:08:09.990 --> 03:08:10.949]  that backfires.
[03:08:10.949 --> 03:08:18.630]  Like in my case, that totally pushed me towards the gospel, the reality of Christ and the reality of
[03:08:18.630 --> 03:08:23.750]  the multidimensional spiritual war that I'm facing every single day of my life.
[03:08:24.789 --> 03:08:29.189]  From all the way to the top, Bill Gates, Klaus Schwab, the New World Order, the World Economic
[03:08:29.189 --> 03:08:35.270]  Forum, the Satanists in Hollywood, the music industry that all interface with off-world
[03:08:35.270 --> 03:08:41.830]  entities, which they call the Nicki Minaj's of the world, the Jay-Z's of the world, you name it,
[03:08:41.830 --> 03:08:43.510]  all these people that are open about it.
[03:08:43.510 --> 03:08:48.310]  And by the way, I was watching the, for all the Gen Zers out there, I was watching a documentary
[03:08:48.310 --> 03:08:56.070]  on Juice WRLD, rapper that OD'd on his private jet, kid was a total drug addict, popped like,
[03:08:56.070 --> 03:09:05.029]  I think he was on like 20, 30 pills of every single day, popping Molly, he was drinking like
[03:09:05.830 --> 03:09:12.390]  ungodly amounts of promethazine every single day where the people around him, his team around him
[03:09:12.390 --> 03:09:17.189]  had to lie to him about how much lean they were pouring into his cup and his Sprite because the
[03:09:17.189 --> 03:09:23.590]  guy was a total drug addict, and I was watching the documentary and it's nothing new, but I just
[03:09:23.590 --> 03:09:31.349]  found it interesting. It just never ends, it never stops. Kid said that he was studying to be a lawyer
[03:09:32.470 --> 03:09:41.750]  and one day he just decided to do PCP. One day decided to do PCP, had this total euphoric high,
[03:09:41.750 --> 03:09:46.230]  right, we hear this a lot, right, just jack out, kind of like your mind jacks out,
[03:09:46.230 --> 03:09:50.869]  goes into the multidimensional, decides he's just going to be a mainstream rapper one day,
[03:09:51.830 --> 03:09:57.430]  just leaves being a lawyer, does some PCP, decides he's going to be a mainstream SoundCloud rapper,
[03:09:57.430 --> 03:10:04.550]  explodes, is worldwide making millions of dollars, becomes a total drug addict, which is totally sad,
[03:10:05.189 --> 03:10:11.349]  dies on an airplane, and it's crazy because when you watch the documentary, the guy's girlfriend,
[03:10:12.310 --> 03:10:16.789]  she's recounting what happened in the private jet because they were raided by police officers,
[03:10:16.789 --> 03:10:22.310]  gun charges, drug charges, all this stuff, and the kid OD'd, but she made this comment,
[03:10:23.510 --> 03:10:26.789]  just like the pastor is talking about with Alex Jones in the last segment. I mean,
[03:10:26.789 --> 03:10:31.270]  the spiritual reality is real. The girlfriend, right before Juice WRLD died, she said he made
[03:10:31.270 --> 03:10:39.029]  this screech, this inhuman screech and scream on the private jet while they were all getting
[03:10:39.189 --> 03:10:45.510]  arrested by law enforcement for the gun charges and the drug charges. He said he made this
[03:10:45.510 --> 03:10:50.390]  ungodly screech, this scream that she'd never heard before, and she said, I swear,
[03:10:50.390 --> 03:10:59.189]  she closes her eyes, and you could tell she's visually and in her mind reliving the audio,
[03:10:59.750 --> 03:11:05.590]  and she says, I just heard this ungodly screech, I'm paraphrasing, and these were her words,
[03:11:06.550 --> 03:11:13.430]  I swear it was like just demons leaving his body. What she said, she said, I swear it
[03:11:13.430 --> 03:11:20.230]  sounded like demons leaving his body, and the kid died, he OD'd. So it's kind of like,
[03:11:20.230 --> 03:11:24.550]  it goes back to what Christ talked about, especially to this generation where,
[03:11:25.590 --> 03:11:28.550]  you know, what is it to a man if he gains the whole world but loses his own soul?
[03:11:29.510 --> 03:11:36.470]  Is the eternal price to pay to losing your own soul, gaining the entire world,
[03:11:36.470 --> 03:11:40.230]  it doesn't matter how many trillions of dollars, it doesn't matter how famous you are,
[03:11:40.230 --> 03:11:44.070]  it doesn't matter how smart or wise the accumulation of knowledge,
[03:11:44.070 --> 03:11:49.430]  it doesn't matter how much clout, notoriety you have, it does not matter at all,
[03:11:49.990 --> 03:11:53.430]  all right, because I can guarantee you there was a man by the name of King Solomon that was that,
[03:11:53.910 --> 03:12:03.029]  and more, most famous, most wise, God bless this man with ungodly, I mean, it's just like,
[03:12:03.029 --> 03:12:09.029]  the guy was super rich, this guy had kings and queens, all right, of foreign nations,
[03:12:09.029 --> 03:12:14.470]  bringing gold, bringing just, this guy was blessed beyond imagine, okay?
[03:12:15.670 --> 03:12:21.590]  He had intellectual abilities that were given by God when he was a child because he asked God,
[03:12:22.150 --> 03:12:25.029]  you know, how do I judge, how do I judge your people? I just,
[03:12:25.830 --> 03:12:28.070]  how am I supposed to judge your people? I'm just a kid, how do I do this?
[03:12:28.710 --> 03:12:33.270]  God was pleased with that answer, and he asked for wisdom, and God gave him this godly wisdom
[03:12:33.270 --> 03:12:40.470]  that was beyond anything. King Solomon was an advanced individual, rich beyond our wildest
[03:12:40.470 --> 03:12:48.230]  dreams, fame, his name was known worldwide, no social media, no TV, no television,
[03:12:49.029 --> 03:12:56.869]  everything word of mouth, maybe written letter at that, but this man's fame was worldwide,
[03:12:56.869 --> 03:13:02.550]  world-renowned, you talk about a man that had everything you could possibly think of, okay?
[03:13:03.270 --> 03:13:06.230]  I mean, all the SoundCloud rappers think they got all the women,
[03:13:06.869 --> 03:13:11.910]  King Solomon had all the women, man, all right, this guy, he lost his way, he totally lost his
[03:13:11.910 --> 03:13:17.510]  way, had everything you could possibly think of, and then he writes down the book of Ecclesiastes,
[03:13:17.510 --> 03:13:22.949]  okay? And he concludes, especially particularly to young people at the end of the book,
[03:13:24.470 --> 03:13:27.830]  know your creator, he speaks directly to the youth, know your creator, know your God,
[03:13:28.789 --> 03:13:34.150]  young people need to know who God is. This is a guy that had everything that you and I can't
[03:13:34.150 --> 03:13:40.310]  even comprehend, and the guy concludes because he departed from God so far that life was
[03:13:40.310 --> 03:13:46.789]  meaningless, totally blackpilled at the end of his life, had everything you could possibly think of,
[03:13:46.789 --> 03:13:51.830]  all the women, all the gold, all the money, all the fame, and I'm talking like stuff we can't
[03:13:51.830 --> 03:13:57.750]  comprehend, man, all right? Not just like, yeah, this guy came up beyond Bill Gates, beyond all
[03:13:57.750 --> 03:14:02.869]  these people, okay? Guy concludes at the end of his life that it's all meaningless.
[03:14:04.230 --> 03:14:09.910]  It's shocking, you know? And it's not like the typical, you know, cliche, you know,
[03:14:09.910 --> 03:14:14.390]  you could have everything but still be empty, you could have everything and still have nothing.
[03:14:15.349 --> 03:14:18.949]  But on the level of King Solomon, I guess the point is, ladies and gentlemen, is
[03:14:20.390 --> 03:14:24.949]  A, the accumulation of everything in planet Earth that we find
[03:14:26.710 --> 03:14:31.750]  valuable, there's nothing wrong with money, the love of money is the root of all evil,
[03:14:33.590 --> 03:14:38.390]  there's nothing wrong with being blessed with physical things, it's just when you start to
[03:14:39.110 --> 03:14:47.510]  worship all those things other than God, okay? God makes people famous, there's nothing inherently
[03:14:47.510 --> 03:14:53.590]  wrong with fame, it's the pursuit and the obsession with it, like Satan has, right?
[03:14:53.590 --> 03:14:59.590]  That desire, it's the desire to be above God, to be worshipped as a God, as an idol, okay?
[03:15:00.150 --> 03:15:06.310]  It's when you begin to make all those things God and you worship them, it becomes your identity,
[03:15:06.310 --> 03:15:11.590]  it becomes your everyday pursuit, it becomes the embodiment of who you are,
[03:15:12.310 --> 03:15:18.070]  and God is void of all of it, that's when it becomes a huge problem. And we know that here
[03:15:18.070 --> 03:15:22.310]  in the United States of America, that is the ultimate trend, young people, it's just the
[03:15:22.310 --> 03:15:27.349]  attraction of mankind, it's always been that way. It's the shiny forbidden fruit.
[03:15:29.029 --> 03:15:32.630]  But you take a look at a guy like King Solomon that's been beyond every single one of those
[03:15:32.630 --> 03:15:38.949]  things and still concludes at the end of his life, this all means nothing. Because I was so
[03:15:38.949 --> 03:15:44.630]  far from God, makes his way back towards God, finds repentance, and at the end of the day,
[03:15:45.349 --> 03:15:52.310]  God is not the only thing, he's not a thing, God is what will fulfill. God is, Christ is
[03:15:52.869 --> 03:15:58.630]  what will fulfill. We'll be right back. This is Adam King, host of The Adam King Show,

[03:19:02.150 --> 03:19:06.949]  anybody can deny it, and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us.
[03:19:07.670 --> 03:19:11.750]  When we talk about the crew at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers,
[03:19:13.110 --> 03:19:18.789]  they really have been the MVPs in this fight, and we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer
[03:19:18.789 --> 03:19:24.550]  and the hard work they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible,
[03:19:25.430 --> 03:19:28.390]  so for myself, the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support,
[03:19:29.029 --> 03:19:34.070]  and I want to encourage you now to realize that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support
[03:19:34.070 --> 03:19:38.150]  us. I know you spread the word, I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it, but
[03:19:38.789 --> 03:19:43.110]  most viewers and listeners never go to InfoWarsStore.com, and you never buy great
[03:19:43.110 --> 03:19:47.510]  products that enrich and empower your life, all at the same time keep us on air. I know that less
[03:19:47.510 --> 03:19:52.949]  than 1% of our listeners actually go buy products at InfoWarsStore.com. If just 1% more of you took
[03:19:52.949 --> 03:19:57.110]  action and went to InfoWarsStore.com, our funding problems will be over. Please take action now.
[03:19:57.110 --> 03:20:04.070]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order, it's Alex Jones.
[03:20:27.110 --> 03:20:32.789]  Go to the channel, subscribe there as well, follow me on Twitter, I appreciate every single
[03:20:32.789 --> 03:20:37.830]  one of you guys, and as always, it's an honor, man, it's an honor here to be here on Ban.Video,
[03:20:37.830 --> 03:20:42.470]  InfoWars.com, the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show. I want to get into some of the news, which
[03:20:43.349 --> 03:20:49.110]  I'm telling you, man, if you are not walking with Christ, you are a sitting duck, how would
[03:20:49.110 --> 03:20:54.230]  you ever know what you're really facing? How would you ever be able to discern truly?
[03:20:55.189 --> 03:21:00.550]  Because there are things going on behind the scenes, obviously with the deep state,
[03:21:00.550 --> 03:21:06.710]  the shadow government. The Bible talks about this, we wrestle not against flesh and blood,
[03:21:06.710 --> 03:21:13.270]  but against principalities, spiritual hosts of wickedness, all right? We are at war in this
[03:21:13.270 --> 03:21:20.150]  multidimensional universe that God has created. Sometimes they manifest, sometimes they don't.
[03:21:20.550 --> 03:21:25.910]  Sometimes they possess human beings in order to push an agenda or influence the masses,
[03:21:25.910 --> 03:21:32.310]  sometimes they don't. Sometimes they make a move, sometimes they wait very patiently in order for a
[03:21:32.310 --> 03:21:37.189]  generation to die off that's obedient to Christ, and then they make their move on an entire next
[03:21:37.189 --> 03:21:42.949]  generation, which by the way, that's kind of what you're seeing with this entire movement,
[03:21:42.949 --> 03:21:49.590]  the LGBTQ woke, disgusting mob that's going after children, that wants to mutilate their
[03:21:49.590 --> 03:21:56.070]  bodies, to sterilize, hijack the minds of an entire generation. It's an attack on God,
[03:21:56.070 --> 03:21:59.910]  an attack on those that are made in God's image, you're watching that.
[03:21:59.910 --> 03:22:04.390]  These are not just agendas of humans, guys. It's too strategic for that.
[03:22:05.670 --> 03:22:09.830]  These are not just agendas of humans that are being deployed in various countries.
[03:22:10.789 --> 03:22:14.710]  These have demonic origins. The Bible does talk about in the book of James,
[03:22:15.590 --> 03:22:21.029]  there's human wisdom, there's also demonic wisdom as well, and there's heavenly wisdom that comes
[03:22:21.029 --> 03:22:27.029]  from God, the word of God, the messages that come from God through the prophets, right?
[03:22:28.150 --> 03:22:33.990]  But there's also demonic wisdom. We know that Satan is running things here on planet Earth,
[03:22:33.990 --> 03:22:39.430]  he's deployed his demons, disembodied spirits, fallen angels as well, that are calling shots,
[03:22:39.590 --> 03:22:44.470]  you take a look at the book of Daniel, remember Daniel was praying fervently, praying fervently,
[03:22:44.470 --> 03:22:49.189]  the angel came and responded to him days later and told Daniel, Daniel, we heard your prayer,
[03:22:49.189 --> 03:22:55.029]  we heard you from the beginning, but this demonic spirit, he called it like a spirit over the
[03:22:55.029 --> 03:23:00.150]  nation at this time, I had to go to war with it before I could get to you. So this is some real
[03:23:00.150 --> 03:23:05.590]  stuff, ladies and gentlemen, all right? They're geographically, strategically placed,
[03:23:05.590 --> 03:23:11.189]  these demonic beings, these fallen angels, their commander-in-chief is Lucifer and Satan,
[03:23:11.189 --> 03:23:16.230]  he's not God, let's just get this straight, a lot of people get this theologically incorrect, right?
[03:23:16.869 --> 03:23:22.550]  The devil's after me, the devil's after me, the chances of that might be really slim,
[03:23:23.430 --> 03:23:27.349]  because we can't give the devil too much credit, he's not God, he wants to be God,
[03:23:28.070 --> 03:23:34.550]  God is omniscient, right? God knows everything, he sees everything, he's omnipresent, right?
[03:23:35.189 --> 03:23:40.630]  He's all-knowing, God is, okay? But the devil's not, he can't be everywhere at once,
[03:23:40.630 --> 03:23:44.869]  he doesn't know everything at once, he can only be in one geographical location at once.
[03:23:45.750 --> 03:23:49.349]  So that's why when you take a look at the spiritual war from a biblical perspective,
[03:23:49.349 --> 03:23:53.029]  all this is strategic, that's why the Bible says, hey, put on the full armor of God that you might
[03:23:53.029 --> 03:23:59.110]  withstand the wiles of the devil, that means the strategic, very strategic, well-planned and
[03:23:59.110 --> 03:24:07.590]  thought-out schemes, okay, of Satan, and these are all carried out, it's very militaristic,
[03:24:08.310 --> 03:24:11.750]  they're deployed, they're very strategized as well, and they're very organized,
[03:24:12.789 --> 03:24:16.550]  and they know when to go after human beings, they know how to tempt human beings, they
[03:24:16.550 --> 03:24:21.430]  push their agendas at certain times, you start to see it bleed through humanity,
[03:24:22.070 --> 03:24:25.430]  every now and then there'll be some kind of new thing, some kind of new cult,
[03:24:26.150 --> 03:24:31.270]  some kind of new deep state authoritarian move, some kind of Antichrist, that's why the Bible
[03:24:31.270 --> 03:24:35.670]  says, Alex mentioned it earlier, that's very, very accurate in the book of 1 John,
[03:24:35.670 --> 03:24:41.189]  many Antichrists have been deployed into the world, but the Antichrist is coming, it's a spirit
[03:24:42.470 --> 03:24:47.430]  that is looking towards the very end that wants to dismantle anything that resembles God to
[03:24:47.430 --> 03:24:52.310]  implement itself as being worshipped as God, what is Antichrist, does that simply mean to be in
[03:24:52.310 --> 03:24:58.230]  opposition towards Christianity, no, that's part of it, but Antichrist, you read it in Greek,
[03:24:58.949 --> 03:25:04.869]  pseudo-Christ means one in the place of, taking the place of Christ, counterfeit,
[03:25:04.869 --> 03:25:11.110]  a fake, a phony, it could be technological, it could be a cult, it could be a human,
[03:25:11.990 --> 03:25:18.390]  it could be an individual, a lot of historians obviously refer to even Adolf Hitler as
[03:25:19.029 --> 03:25:24.230]  an Antichrist, obviously I was, I mean it was crazy when you see like what Joseph Goebbels was
[03:25:24.230 --> 03:25:29.029]  doing with Hitler, it was wild man, it was totally propping him up as the savior of Germany and
[03:25:29.750 --> 03:25:36.390]  the propaganda from the Nazis back in the 1940s, 1930s, they would take a lot of Christian themes,
[03:25:36.390 --> 03:25:41.110]  obviously, you know, look how that ended up, you know, they would have Adolf Hitler
[03:25:41.990 --> 03:25:47.110]  when he was like flying in to go speak at his rallies campaigning for the Nazis around
[03:25:47.110 --> 03:25:52.550]  Hitler Germany, these guys were advanced man, they would have Hitler flying in a plane over
[03:25:52.550 --> 03:25:57.510]  thousands of people, you guys can go look this up, YouTube, wherever, they'd have Hitler flying over
[03:25:58.230 --> 03:26:02.550]  thousands of people in a plane, flying over Germany, it would always be in the shape of a
[03:26:02.550 --> 03:26:10.550]  cross and the message was savior, messiah, messianic figure of the German people,
[03:26:11.189 --> 03:26:15.590]  I mean when you really look at the theology of Adolf Hitler and the psychotic Nazis,
[03:26:15.590 --> 03:26:21.430]  these people believed in the Aryan race, the oncoming of the 1,000 year reign of the Third
[03:26:21.430 --> 03:26:25.750]  Reich, sounds very familiar to the Bible, doesn't it, because Christ is going to reign for a thousand
[03:26:25.750 --> 03:26:32.630]  years and we, the born-again Christians, will rule and reign with him, which technically we will be
[03:26:34.150 --> 03:26:40.390]  very superior, and I don't say this in a racist way, it's just the theological
[03:26:41.029 --> 03:26:46.630]  biblical interpretation, when we rule and reign, we're going to be advanced beings,
[03:26:46.630 --> 03:26:52.869]  we're going to be given geographical territory, we're going to be given abilities to be able to
[03:26:52.869 --> 03:27:00.470]  judge righteously over Christ's 1,000 millennial reign and kingdom on planet Earth, so we will be
[03:27:00.470 --> 03:27:07.029]  superior in terms of being with Christ, being with God, the ultimate superior one, which is God,
[03:27:07.029 --> 03:27:11.510]  it's not a racist thing to say, it's not a derogatory thing to say, it's not a discriminative,
[03:27:11.510 --> 03:27:15.270]  it's not a discrimination to say that, it's that's just the theological reality of the
[03:27:15.270 --> 03:27:20.310]  world that we live in right now, so technically the reason why I say this is when you take a
[03:27:20.310 --> 03:27:24.869]  look at an antichrist, it's not just someone in opposition, the Nazis did this, it's someone in
[03:27:24.869 --> 03:27:31.830]  the position functioning as a messianic figure, claiming to be the messiah, claiming to be the
[03:27:31.830 --> 03:27:37.590]  savior of a nation, of a civilization, of people, of a group of people, it could just even be a city,
[03:27:37.590 --> 03:27:41.830]  it could just be a cult of five people, a sex cult, a religious cult that we've seen,
[03:27:41.830 --> 03:27:46.710]  we've seen this over and over and over time, a centralized figure claims to be the messiah
[03:27:46.710 --> 03:27:52.869]  that will save that group of people and take them into an eternity of ecstasy and salvation forever,
[03:27:52.869 --> 03:27:58.869]  right, it's just the same satanic message that's antichrist, but if they did the same thing with
[03:27:58.869 --> 03:28:03.590]  Adolf Hitler, the Nazis did the same thing with him, but what I want people to kind of see is how
[03:28:03.590 --> 03:28:11.430]  it kind of mirrors the scripture, Hitler's believed, and Hitler would interface with
[03:28:11.430 --> 03:28:17.110]  mediums, wanted to constantly make sure that he was hearing from some kind of off-world entity,
[03:28:17.110 --> 03:28:21.830]  some kind of prophecy that he was the chosen one and he would be chosen to lead the Aryan race,
[03:28:21.830 --> 03:28:27.029]  the superior race for a thousand years, the third thousand year reich into the future,
[03:28:27.750 --> 03:28:32.150]  you think about it, there's only one that's going to reign in the very end on planet earth before
[03:28:32.150 --> 03:28:37.270]  we go straight into heaven and god revamps the entire universe, and that's christ for a thousand
[03:28:37.270 --> 03:28:44.230]  years, how does that happen? that's antichrist, not just someone that's in opposition towards
[03:28:44.230 --> 03:28:49.270]  christianity and jesus christ, but it's someone that's a counterfeit that's trying to take his
[03:28:49.270 --> 03:28:54.310]  place, there is no human messianic figure, it's only jesus christ, god in human flesh,
[03:28:55.270 --> 03:28:59.430]  we'll be right back, you wanted to plug rainforest, do you like rainforest? yeah, so
[03:28:59.430 --> 03:29:04.230]  my name is ken heckin ladley, how do I write all the books that I do, four books with dr judy
[03:29:04.230 --> 03:29:09.430]  majkiewicz, four books with project ferritos whistleblowers, and now two books with alex jones,
[03:29:09.430 --> 03:29:16.310]  that's because I use brain force every day, what I always need is I always need some sort of boost
[03:29:16.310 --> 03:29:21.750]  in the morning, and so you know I try to exercise, eat well, take good vitamins, but the one thing
[03:29:21.750 --> 03:29:27.830]  that I have really found that makes a difference is brain force, I'll take brain force in the
[03:29:27.830 --> 03:29:33.349]  morning right before I go to my computer, and I'm good for the next four or five hours writing a
[03:29:33.349 --> 03:29:38.949]  whole lot of stuff, so it really is true that brain force is something I use every day, and it helps
[03:29:38.949 --> 03:29:43.110]  me with my writing, all right we love you, we'll be right back, get your brain force plus brain
[03:29:43.110 --> 03:29:47.750]  force ultra and turbo force at infowarestore.com, we'll be right back with our number two,
[03:29:56.390 --> 03:30:02.310]  iodine is naturally acquired through the soil, which is at the foundation of our entire food
[03:30:02.310 --> 03:30:08.390]  supply, modern farming techniques have stripped the soil of this essential trace element, which
[03:30:08.390 --> 03:30:14.310]  has caused an iodine deficiency in about half the population, and there are two things we need to do
[03:30:14.310 --> 03:30:20.869]  about it, we need to practice more regenerative farming, there are plenty of proven technologies
[03:30:20.869 --> 03:30:27.029]  in permaculture and biodynamics that will naturally keep the soil rich with iodine,
[03:30:27.029 --> 03:30:33.430]  and we need to ensure that we get the sufficient amount of iodine every day, derived from ancient
[03:30:33.430 --> 03:30:40.310]  sea salts found thousands of feet below the earth's surface, our InfoWars Life Survival Shield
[03:30:40.310 --> 03:30:49.430]  X3 is hands down the best, pure nascent iodine, stabilized in an activated triiodine form,

[03:30:57.110 --> 03:31:01.910]  I talk a lot about the great successes InfoWars has had, I don't think anybody can deny it,
[03:31:02.550 --> 03:31:07.590]  and it is because of listeners and viewers supporting us, when we talk about the crew
[03:31:07.590 --> 03:31:13.029]  at InfoWars, people behind the scenes, the researchers, the writers, they really have
[03:31:13.029 --> 03:31:18.310]  been the MVPs in this fight, and we look at Harrison Smith and Owen Schroer and the hard work
[03:31:18.310 --> 03:31:25.029]  they engage in every day, five, six, seven days a week, it's really just incredible, so for myself,
[03:31:25.029 --> 03:31:29.590]  the whole InfoWars crew, I thank you for your past support, and I want to encourage you now to realize
[03:31:29.590 --> 03:31:34.710]  that InfoWars cannot stay on air if you do not support us, I know you spread the word,
[03:31:34.710 --> 03:31:38.789]  I know you pray for us, and that's wonderful, keep doing it, but most viewers and listeners

[03:32:55.800 --> 03:33:19.240]  And we are back, you are now watching, tuned in to the most banned transmission on the face
[03:33:19.240 --> 03:33:24.119]  of planet Earth, arguably the universe, the fourth hour of the Alex Jones Show, I am your
[03:33:24.119 --> 03:33:28.840]  guest host, Drew Hernandez. All righty guys, well let's continue. I wanted to get into
[03:33:28.840 --> 03:33:34.599]  some of the news today. Speaking of deception, speaking of wolves in sheep's clothing, there's
[03:33:34.599 --> 03:33:38.439]  a lot going on today, but I really wanted to zero in on this, especially with the theme that I've
[03:33:38.439 --> 03:33:44.519]  been hearing on the network all day today. With the deep state operations, all these deep state
[03:33:44.519 --> 03:33:52.199]  ops, the feds, setting Alex Jones up, setting Owen Schroyer up, the feds setting up patriots,
[03:33:52.199 --> 03:33:57.560]  you see the J6 operation, you see the false flags, we've been seeing these developments of
[03:33:57.560 --> 03:34:02.519]  the mega Republicans, the right-wing domestic terrorists, they're all plotting to shut down
[03:34:02.519 --> 03:34:08.199]  power grids across the United States of America, just priming the public to get ready to blame an
[03:34:08.199 --> 03:34:14.519]  adversary for when it happens, right? It's nothing new because we know that false flags and psyops
[03:34:14.519 --> 03:34:20.039]  have been being practiced for thousands of years. The ultimate psyop took place in the Garden of
[03:34:20.039 --> 03:34:27.720]  Eden, okay? The devil lied and manipulated and warped the mind of Eve, and here we are. We are
[03:34:27.720 --> 03:34:33.960]  plunged into the total fallen world and need to be redeemed by Christ Jesus through the cross,
[03:34:33.960 --> 03:34:39.800]  right? So anyone that says false flags, I mean the Nazis did it, the commies did it,
[03:34:40.359 --> 03:34:47.800]  the totalitarians, the authoritarians, they do it. And of course, the CIA and the FBI of
[03:34:48.439 --> 03:34:53.560]  the current day is going to sit there and convince you that that's all conspiracy theory.
[03:34:53.560 --> 03:35:01.240]  False flags are all conspiracy. There are no moves of the shadow government going against the people
[03:35:01.240 --> 03:35:07.960]  of the occupied nations. That doesn't take place anywhere. That would never happen in the United
[03:35:07.960 --> 03:35:13.960]  States of America. We are a first world country. We're advanced. We're advanced, not only
[03:35:13.960 --> 03:35:20.039]  technologically, but we are socially advanced. We're not Haiti. We're not commie Cuba. We're
[03:35:20.039 --> 03:35:27.160]  not socialist Venezuela. We're not North Korea. Oh, but yeah, you take a look at the CCP and all
[03:35:27.160 --> 03:35:31.000]  the tyranny going there, and you see Klaus Schwab running around on the news saying,
[03:35:31.000 --> 03:35:35.960]  well, they're the model. Bill Gates loves China. They're the model. They're the model.
[03:35:36.519 --> 03:35:43.400]  With their tyranny, it is just a technocracy. It's a technologically advanced tyrannical system.
[03:35:43.960 --> 03:35:48.039]  But it's supposed to appeal to you because everything technologically today is supposed
[03:35:48.039 --> 03:35:53.160]  to make your life more convenient, right? It's being sold to us on a platter.
[03:35:54.279 --> 03:36:00.439]  Tyranny, digitized tyranny is being sold to us on a platter of convenience for your life, right?
[03:36:01.080 --> 03:36:06.439]  Nothing wrong with technology. I love technology. I think God has blessed us with technology because
[03:36:06.439 --> 03:36:11.400]  technology can be used for good. It could be used for the gospel. It could be used to save an
[03:36:11.400 --> 03:36:17.640]  innocent person's life. It could be used medically to really help somebody. But of course, everything
[03:36:17.640 --> 03:36:23.400]  is perverted, it's inverted, and it's used as a weapon of Satan, the New World Order,
[03:36:23.400 --> 03:36:28.519]  and evil against humanity rather than used for the glory of God, just like a human being.
[03:36:28.519 --> 03:36:36.599]  A human being, in my opinion, the most advanced creation, God's creation, a human being, right?
[03:36:37.320 --> 03:36:42.359]  The mystery. But only God knows how he's engineered mankind. But why do you think that
[03:36:43.080 --> 03:36:49.240]  sick, twisted, satanic, freak doctors and scientists, they want to have their own image?
[03:36:49.240 --> 03:36:56.759]  They want to build mankind into their own AI, cyborg, hybrid human animal.
[03:36:57.480 --> 03:37:02.519]  You know, they want to hack the bodies of humans. They want to rearrange the anatomy,
[03:37:02.519 --> 03:37:07.960]  the biological anatomy of human beings outside and inside the body. Why? Why? Why? Why? Because
[03:37:07.960 --> 03:37:16.039]  they all want to be God. So they play God rather than just obey God. And like I said, there's
[03:37:16.039 --> 03:37:20.279]  nothing wrong with science. There's nothing wrong with technological advances. Those things could be
[03:37:20.279 --> 03:37:28.519]  used to actually glorify God. I think that science kind of reveals the revelation of God's creation,
[03:37:28.519 --> 03:37:33.640]  which the Bible talks about in Romans chapter one. There is no denying the existence of this
[03:37:33.640 --> 03:37:41.480]  creator because his fingerprints, his blueprints, the architectural blueprints of the universe and
[03:37:41.480 --> 03:37:48.599]  planet Earth are all around us. So there's no excuse. I guess what I'm trying to say is where
[03:37:48.599 --> 03:37:54.519]  we're at currently right now in this specific point in time is a lot of deception is introducing
[03:37:54.519 --> 03:37:58.519]  itself just like the Bible said it would, just like Christ said it would. False messiahs,
[03:37:58.519 --> 03:38:04.039]  wolves in sheep's clothing, false prophets, individuals that claim to be hearing from God,
[03:38:04.759 --> 03:38:10.519]  claiming to be speaking for God, but in reality don't have the doctrines of God. That's the
[03:38:10.519 --> 03:38:15.000]  important part, guys. The important part here is that whether you're seeing something in the
[03:38:15.000 --> 03:38:20.599]  mainstream media or whether you're seeing something in alternative media or whether you're seeing
[03:38:20.599 --> 03:38:25.560]  something arise that claims to be the truth and enlightenment or whether you're seeing it in a
[03:38:25.560 --> 03:38:32.119]  movie through music or whatever it may be because we live in this interdimensional world where Satan
[03:38:32.119 --> 03:38:38.279]  and demons are all in charge geographically deceiving the nations through political figures,
[03:38:38.279 --> 03:38:43.000]  through cultural figures, through music, through the arts, through education, through the world
[03:38:43.000 --> 03:38:49.400]  of politics, you name it. You got to be really paying attention to these individuals that claim
[03:38:49.400 --> 03:38:54.920]  to have some kind of hidden enlightened knowledge or these individuals claim to be speaking on
[03:38:54.920 --> 03:39:02.599]  behalf of God. Do they have the doctrines of God in line with their message and their lives?
[03:39:02.599 --> 03:39:07.720]  Because Christ said, you shall know a false prophet, you shall know a wolf in sheep's clothing
[03:39:07.720 --> 03:39:13.000]  by what? You shall know them by their fruit. That's how you know whether they're true or
[03:39:13.000 --> 03:39:18.039]  whether they're false. The fruits of their lives, their lifestyles, the fruits of their doctrine,
[03:39:18.039 --> 03:39:23.560]  the messages that they preach, does it line up with the words of Christ? Does it line up with the
[03:39:23.560 --> 03:39:31.800]  doctrines of Christ? Does it line up with the inherent perfect word of God? If the answer to
[03:39:31.800 --> 03:39:37.000]  that question is no, you're dealing with a false prophet, you're dealing with a false teacher,
[03:39:37.880 --> 03:39:44.920]  you're dealing with a heretic, or you are dealing with someone that is absolutely deceived. We see
[03:39:45.000 --> 03:39:49.160]  this in the book of Acts. Apollos was coming out preaching, preaching, preaching, preaching the same
[03:39:49.160 --> 03:39:55.720]  message that John the Baptist had. Didn't quite have the full message of salvation that Christ
[03:39:55.720 --> 03:40:01.320]  brought. And so the disciples at that time had to sit him down, explain to him the full gospel,
[03:40:01.320 --> 03:40:06.679]  and then they deployed him. And then he was preaching the full message, right? Someone can
[03:40:06.679 --> 03:40:13.320]  be preaching a false message, but be totally ignorant and deceived. But the test of time,
[03:40:13.320 --> 03:40:20.119]  you will discern their fruit if you confront that individual and you explain to them,
[03:40:20.119 --> 03:40:24.920]  your message is way off, man. This is what the Bible says. Let's get it right so we can make
[03:40:24.920 --> 03:40:29.880]  sure that we're not deceiving people. How they react to that will show you their true fruit.
[03:40:30.439 --> 03:40:35.880]  Do they get defensive? Do they defend their false theology? Do they defend that they're not in line
[03:40:35.880 --> 03:40:41.240]  with the Bible? Do they defend that they're actually not preaching the accurate gospel or
[03:40:41.240 --> 03:40:46.599]  word of God? Do they get hostile? Do they come up against you? Okay, well, then they're an agent
[03:40:46.599 --> 03:40:51.480]  of Satan and their fruit is not fruits of repentance saying, okay, I got it wrong, God.
[03:40:51.480 --> 03:40:58.039]  I got it wrong. Let's come back. Let's preach the full counsel of God. That's fruits of repentance,
[03:40:58.039 --> 03:41:02.359]  especially, guys, it's very clear. If you take a look at the Bible, teachers are held to a higher
[03:41:02.359 --> 03:41:09.720]  standard. They will be judged more strictly because they are coming out and identifying
[03:41:09.800 --> 03:41:15.000]  as a teacher of the eternal word of God. So not only will you be judged stricter,
[03:41:15.800 --> 03:41:19.880]  not only by your peers and those around you that are listening to what you're saying based off of
[03:41:19.880 --> 03:41:23.800]  your doctrine and your lifestyle. None of us are perfect, but there is a higher standard for
[03:41:23.800 --> 03:41:30.039]  pastors and teachers. Those that claim to be walking with Christ be above reproach. Don't
[03:41:30.039 --> 03:41:34.039]  bring a disdain to the gospel. Don't bring a reproach to the gospel. But guys, listen, we all
[03:41:34.039 --> 03:41:39.320]  fail. But what I'll say is this is someone that comes up and starts to claim to be speaking on
[03:41:39.320 --> 03:41:45.720]  behalf of God. Okay. Those that bear the word of God and that are teaching others and speaking to
[03:41:45.720 --> 03:41:51.160]  others, you will be held to a stricter judgment, not only by your peers and those in theological
[03:41:51.160 --> 03:41:56.279]  circles that are listening to you and discerning, but God himself. Why? Because it is such a heavy
[03:41:56.279 --> 03:42:02.119]  responsibility to be speaking on behalf of the eternal God. I mean, think about it. If someone
[03:42:02.119 --> 03:42:07.080]  was running around speaking on behalf of you, if they got it wrong, yeah, you'd be kind of pissed,
[03:42:07.080 --> 03:42:11.400]  right? You'd be kind of offended, like, no, I don't believe that. That's not what I say.
[03:42:11.400 --> 03:42:15.400]  It's not what I believe. That's not what I said. Please don't misrepresent me.
[03:42:17.000 --> 03:42:22.199]  And this happens to God every moment of every single day. But this is why we got to get it
[03:42:22.199 --> 03:42:28.359]  right. Show yourself approved, a good worker that rightly divides the word of truth, rightly divides
[03:42:28.359 --> 03:42:32.359]  the Bible. You got to spend some time with the Bible. You got to spend some time with God. You
[03:42:32.359 --> 03:42:36.279]  got to make sure you know what you're talking about. You got to make sure you are as accurate
[03:42:36.279 --> 03:42:41.960]  as you possibly can be, because we're talking about souls here. We're talking about shepherding
[03:42:41.960 --> 03:42:48.439]  souls. We're talking about either leading accurately or misleading, terribly inaccurately
[03:42:48.439 --> 03:42:54.599]  the souls of human beings that God sent his only son to bleed for to save. We'll be right back.

[03:43:56.679 --> 03:44:01.240]  Just weeks ago, I warned the world that the globalists were going to move against Tucker
[03:44:01.240 --> 03:44:04.599]  Carlson and take him off the air. People said, no way, he's the most popular thing that ever
[03:44:04.599 --> 03:44:08.759]  happened. They've got quadrillions of stolen money. They only had Tucker Carlson on the air
[03:44:08.759 --> 03:44:11.880]  because they believe they can control him. But as soon as they figured out they couldn't,
[03:44:11.880 --> 03:44:17.480]  he was taken off the air. It's the same thing with Infowars. But Infowars is not owned by Fox
[03:44:17.480 --> 03:44:23.960]  or controlled by George Soros or owned by Spotify like Joe Rogan. We are only beholden to our viewers

[03:45:56.599 --> 03:46:01.240]  Ladies and gentlemen, this book, The Great Reset and War for the World is a historic book that
[03:46:01.240 --> 03:46:06.199]  documents the globalists in their own words, plan for our future. That is a hellish future.
[03:46:06.199 --> 03:46:09.800]  Now you'll be always, while they still allow books, I guess they're starting to ban them,
[03:46:09.800 --> 03:46:13.880]  be able to get an unsigned copy of The Great Reset and War for the World at bookstores,

[03:48:22.300 --> 03:48:25.300]  All righty, guys. I wanted to get into some of the news,
[03:48:25.300 --> 03:48:32.300]  especially talking about false prophets, deceivers, and those that claim to be speaking on behalf of God.
[03:48:32.300 --> 03:48:38.300]  You got to really be careful and guard your heart because a lot of people might identify wolves,
[03:48:38.300 --> 03:48:46.300]  people that are obviously misidentifying, misrepresenting Christ and God in such a miserable way.
[03:48:46.300 --> 03:48:50.300]  It happens in many various different ways.
[03:48:50.300 --> 03:48:55.300]  You get guys that run around claiming to be preaching Jesus that turn out to be pedophiles,
[03:48:55.300 --> 03:49:01.300]  whether they identify with the Catholic Church, Christian evangelical circles, you name it, right?
[03:49:01.300 --> 03:49:05.300]  And it causes people to turn their back on Christ.
[03:49:05.300 --> 03:49:09.300]  But you got to always ask yourself, is that a representation of Christ?
[03:49:09.300 --> 03:49:16.300]  Is that who Christ is or is that just a fallen human being that's twisted and evil and sick in the head and sick in the heart
[03:49:17.300 --> 03:49:20.300]  that's perverted the name of Christ with their behavior?
[03:49:20.300 --> 03:49:27.300]  I'll tell you one thing, all right, and I always tell people this, never, never let a man, never let a woman,
[03:49:27.300 --> 03:49:34.300]  never let an off-world spiritual entity, a disembodied spirit, fallen angel,
[03:49:34.300 --> 03:49:39.300]  never let anything separate you from your relationship with Christ.
[03:49:39.300 --> 03:49:45.300]  All of these fallen things that human beings will fall and let you down with,
[03:49:45.300 --> 03:49:47.300]  Christ never will.
[03:49:47.300 --> 03:49:49.300]  So never take your eyes off of him.
[03:49:49.300 --> 03:49:52.300]  He is the author and finisher of our faith.
[03:49:52.300 --> 03:49:53.300]  He is the perfect one.
[03:49:53.300 --> 03:49:56.300]  He is the one without flaw.
[03:49:56.300 --> 03:49:59.300]  He is the one without mistakes.
[03:49:59.300 --> 03:50:02.300]  He is the one without blemish.
[03:50:02.300 --> 03:50:05.300]  He is the perfect one, okay?
[03:50:05.700 --> 03:50:15.140]  So if everything around you is failing, politicians, so-called churches and pastors, Christians,
[03:50:15.140 --> 03:50:18.460]  you name it, you never let him go.
[03:50:18.460 --> 03:50:19.540]  You never let him go.
[03:50:19.540 --> 03:50:21.020]  Never take your eyes.
[03:50:21.020 --> 03:50:22.820]  You never let his hand go.
[03:50:22.820 --> 03:50:24.980]  Spiritually, you never let go.
[03:50:24.980 --> 03:50:28.980]  I always encourage people that because as we go further and further down these days
[03:50:28.980 --> 03:50:34.380]  of deception, you're going to see Christ warned us, man, a lot of false messiahs, false prophets,
[03:50:34.380 --> 03:50:41.300]  people attempting to represent him that are nothing but perversions of who he is and what
[03:50:41.300 --> 03:50:43.860]  biblical Christianity is.
[03:50:43.860 --> 03:50:48.420]  So I say that before I break down this last story because I think it's appropriate and
[03:50:48.420 --> 03:50:51.580]  I think it's important to talk about because you're going to continue to see a lot of the
[03:50:51.580 --> 03:50:53.180]  stuff, guys.
[03:50:53.180 --> 03:51:02.100]  The Vatican is promoting a study calling for radical inclusion of LGBTQ+, LGBTQ+.
[03:51:02.100 --> 03:51:06.340]  The Vatican is coming out and we know the Vatican has had a whole host of problems with
[03:51:06.340 --> 03:51:13.820]  pedophilia that needs to be called out, peacefully eradicated because that is a miserable, horrific
[03:51:13.820 --> 03:51:18.180]  representation of Christ and God and the doctrines of Jesus.
[03:51:18.180 --> 03:51:24.900]  But of course, the Vatican is now promoting a study calling for radical inclusion of LGBTQ+,
[03:51:24.900 --> 03:51:31.700]  which obviously includes not only adults, but the youth, because that is the New World
[03:51:31.700 --> 03:51:39.140]  Order agenda, perverting God's biological design for marriage for mankind.
[03:51:39.140 --> 03:51:41.900]  Biological male, biological female, for what?
[03:51:41.900 --> 03:51:43.940]  For the purposes of fornication?
[03:51:43.940 --> 03:51:44.940]  No.
[03:51:44.940 --> 03:51:53.280]  For the purposes of holy matrimony in the sight of God, honoring God, and yes, for the purpose
[03:51:53.280 --> 03:51:58.200]  to be fruitful and multiply biological procreation for the human race.
[03:51:58.200 --> 03:52:00.220]  You can't have that with homosexuality.
[03:52:00.220 --> 03:52:01.840]  You can't have that with sodomy.
[03:52:01.840 --> 03:52:03.760]  You can't have that with gay sex.
[03:52:03.760 --> 03:52:06.200]  The Bible is very clear on this in Romans chapter one.
[03:52:06.200 --> 03:52:13.920]  God has incinerated, God has incinerated groups of people over homosexuality, Sodom and Gomorrah.
[03:52:13.920 --> 03:52:18.440]  God has dealt with this in very, very aggressive ways, okay?
[03:52:18.440 --> 03:52:22.560]  So yes, God takes this very serious because this goes to the genesis of who we are as
[03:52:22.600 --> 03:52:24.240]  human beings.
[03:52:24.240 --> 03:52:28.320]  And when you get to the New Testament, fast forward, Romans chapter one, God says, when
[03:52:28.320 --> 03:52:33.720]  I give a people over to a reprobate mind, okay, it's a judgment.
[03:52:33.720 --> 03:52:42.240]  When God gives a nation, gives a people, a person over to a reprobate mind, total depravity,
[03:52:42.240 --> 03:52:47.840]  one of the red flags, or actually I won't say red flag, I'll say one of the identifying
[03:52:47.840 --> 03:52:55.280]  factors that that has happened is that homosexuality becomes absolute dominant in that nation,
[03:52:55.280 --> 03:52:57.480]  in that culture, in that individual.
[03:52:57.480 --> 03:53:01.220]  God says that men burn with lust towards each other and women do the same thing.
[03:53:01.220 --> 03:53:07.400]  They forsake the biological use and order of how God designed everything for mankind
[03:53:07.400 --> 03:53:09.000]  to function in the future.
[03:53:09.000 --> 03:53:13.600]  And then God comes and says in Romans chapter one, not only do they do that, but they pay
[03:53:13.600 --> 03:53:15.600]  the penalty due to them.
[03:53:15.600 --> 03:53:16.600]  It's an error.
[03:53:16.920 --> 03:53:22.040]  AIDS, STDs, the spreads of HIV, everyone loses their mind, total reprobate.
[03:53:22.040 --> 03:53:24.680]  That's why you have the whole trans movement coming now.
[03:53:24.680 --> 03:53:30.320]  The homosexuality comes first and then the reprobate mind is right there with the perversion
[03:53:30.320 --> 03:53:33.040]  and it's just anything goes from there.
[03:53:33.040 --> 03:53:34.040]  Anything goes from there.
[03:53:34.040 --> 03:53:36.120]  Everyone just loses their minds.
[03:53:36.120 --> 03:53:37.940]  That's what the trans movement is.
[03:53:37.940 --> 03:53:41.120]  The transhuman movement, trans people aren't real, they don't exist.
[03:53:41.120 --> 03:53:42.720]  They're all just homosexuals.
[03:53:42.720 --> 03:53:44.920]  I say that all the time because it has to be repeated.
[03:53:44.920 --> 03:53:46.080]  I'm giving you guys Bible.
[03:53:46.080 --> 03:53:49.920]  I'm just giving you straight biblical doctrine, all right?
[03:53:49.920 --> 03:53:52.600]  The trans people don't exist.
[03:53:52.600 --> 03:53:55.720]  They're all just homosexuals, all right?
[03:53:55.720 --> 03:53:59.680]  And so if we're going to be honest about revival in this nation, if we're going to be honest
[03:53:59.680 --> 03:54:06.000]  about taking this country back to God, we have to address the biggest thing in our face
[03:54:06.000 --> 03:54:12.400]  right now, culturally, especially in the United States of America with this LGBTQ occupy everything,
[03:54:12.400 --> 03:54:18.520]  this homonationalism, this gay fascism, corporately, socially, you name it, that we're seeing across
[03:54:18.520 --> 03:54:19.520]  the entire board.
[03:54:19.520 --> 03:54:23.320]  They're infiltrating the churches, but I thought they hated God and that God didn't exist and
[03:54:23.320 --> 03:54:24.880]  that God wasn't a pressure.
[03:54:24.880 --> 03:54:27.680]  No, they're just going to come in and make God a homosexual because they're going to
[03:54:27.680 --> 03:54:31.160]  make God in their own image and idol that they were all worship and they'll try and
[03:54:31.160 --> 03:54:33.640]  push the real God and the real Christ out of the picture.
[03:54:33.640 --> 03:54:36.000]  That's why this has to be addressed.
[03:54:36.000 --> 03:54:38.200]  This has to be addressed accurately.
[03:54:38.200 --> 03:54:39.760]  It has to be repented of.
[03:54:39.760 --> 03:54:44.360]  No more cuckery from conservatives and limp wristed Christians that want to sit there
[03:54:44.360 --> 03:54:46.240]  and dance around this.
[03:54:46.240 --> 03:54:48.240]  Let's address the elephant in the room.
[03:54:48.240 --> 03:54:52.920]  This goes back to the genesis of who we are as human beings.
[03:54:52.920 --> 03:54:54.480]  God instituted marriage.
[03:54:54.480 --> 03:54:56.160]  There is no gay marriage.
[03:54:56.160 --> 03:55:00.200]  God instituted his traditional marriage.
[03:55:00.200 --> 03:55:08.080]  And there is a consequence not only physically with the spread of AIDS, HIV.
[03:55:08.080 --> 03:55:09.200]  They can't procreate.
[03:55:09.200 --> 03:55:10.840]  They can't repopulate a nation.
[03:55:10.840 --> 03:55:16.760]  That's why in California they're pushing bills so that the LGBTQ mob, if you don't accept
[03:55:16.760 --> 03:55:21.240]  the pronouns of your child, they will just take your take your kid and put them in some
[03:55:21.240 --> 03:55:24.480]  homosexual family unit.
[03:55:24.480 --> 03:55:25.680]  It's the only way it can go.
[03:55:25.680 --> 03:55:28.680]  The enemy comes to steal, kill and destroy.
[03:55:28.680 --> 03:55:32.720]  Satan, OK, was cast out of heaven because of pride.
[03:55:32.720 --> 03:55:35.460]  That's why they all identify as the pride movement.
[03:55:35.460 --> 03:55:39.560]  They identify with Satan and Lucifer, their father, the devil.
[03:55:39.560 --> 03:55:44.980]  So they come to steal, kill and destroy, steal the rainbow, steal the Bible.
[03:55:44.980 --> 03:55:46.720]  Let's rewrite God.
[03:55:46.720 --> 03:55:49.340]  Let's make our own homosexual version of God.
[03:55:49.340 --> 03:55:50.340]  Yes.
[03:55:50.340 --> 03:55:52.140]  Let's destroy theological circles.
[03:55:52.140 --> 03:55:53.860]  Let's destroy Christianity.
[03:55:53.860 --> 03:55:55.700]  Let's destroy the family unit.
[03:55:55.700 --> 03:55:57.980]  Let's destroy the bodies of children.
[03:55:57.980 --> 03:56:02.820]  Let's destroy everything that God has instituted and created.
[03:56:02.820 --> 03:56:05.060]  That's the agenda of Lucifer at the end of the day.
[03:56:05.900 --> 03:56:08.900]  So if we're really going to bring this country back to God,
[03:56:08.900 --> 03:56:10.900]  I'll tell you one thing.
[03:56:10.900 --> 03:56:13.900]  The mass murder and genocide of babies is right up there.
[03:56:13.900 --> 03:56:16.900]  That has to be eradicated out of this country.
[03:56:16.900 --> 03:56:22.900]  That blood cries out to God in heaven on a minute basis.
[03:56:22.900 --> 03:56:28.900]  And I will also argue because marriage goes back to the genesis of mankind,
[03:56:28.900 --> 03:56:31.900]  God instituted traditional marriage.
[03:56:31.900 --> 03:56:33.900]  Call it hate speech, call it bigotry,
[03:56:33.900 --> 03:56:36.900]  call it whatever you want, I don't care, all right?
[03:56:36.900 --> 03:56:39.900]  I'm going to be right, not because I'm right,
[03:56:39.900 --> 03:56:45.900]  but because the Bible is the authority for mankind, for the universe.
[03:56:45.900 --> 03:56:47.900]  It's a very simple thing, right?
[03:56:47.900 --> 03:56:50.900]  But that's part of the cuckery where people don't want to just really address it
[03:56:50.900 --> 03:56:53.900]  because I've got a gay friend or I've got a gay this.
[03:56:53.900 --> 03:56:57.900]  Okay, man, well, that person's got to repent just like you and I did.
[03:56:57.900 --> 03:57:01.900]  It's a mind change, it's a redirection of the ship.
[03:57:01.900 --> 03:57:03.900]  You're going one way, we were going in the wrong direction,
[03:57:03.900 --> 03:57:05.900]  it's time to go the other way.
[03:57:05.900 --> 03:57:09.900]  This has to be addressed, it has to be changed, it has to be repented of.
[03:57:09.900 --> 03:57:11.900]  And right now, I'll tell you right now,
[03:57:11.900 --> 03:57:15.900]  this is the one thing that is obviously now infiltrating churches,
[03:57:15.900 --> 03:57:17.900]  wolves in sheep's clothing.
[03:57:17.900 --> 03:57:19.900]  The Apostle Paul made it very clear.
[03:57:19.900 --> 03:57:22.900]  The Holy Spirit explicitly says that in the last days,
[03:57:22.900 --> 03:57:24.900]  many will depart from the faith,
[03:57:24.900 --> 03:57:28.900]  giving heed to deceiving spirits and doctrines of demons.
[03:57:28.900 --> 03:57:30.900]  That's exactly what we're facing.
[03:57:30.900 --> 03:57:32.900]  Every single day.
[03:57:32.900 --> 03:57:34.900]  We want to come back to God.
[03:57:34.900 --> 03:57:36.900]  We want to bring America back to God.
[03:57:36.900 --> 03:57:40.900]  And let's submit to the word of God and the doctrines of God.
[03:57:40.900 --> 03:57:41.900]  All right, guys, I'll see you on the next one.
[03:57:41.900 --> 03:57:43.900]  War Room starts in just a couple minutes.
[03:57:43.900 --> 03:57:45.900]  Stay based, America.
[03:57:47.900 --> 03:57:50.900]  We have three original, one-of-a-kind toothpaste
[03:57:50.900 --> 03:57:52.900]  designed by my father, a dentist,
[03:57:52.900 --> 03:57:54.900]  at mfullerstore.com that don't have fillers,
[03:57:54.900 --> 03:57:58.900]  that are filled with high-quality essential oils and more.
[03:57:58.900 --> 03:58:00.900]  We have the Tumor Toothpaste.
[03:58:00.900 --> 03:58:03.900]  We have the Ultimate Tooth Whitening with Coral Calcium Toothpaste.
[03:58:03.900 --> 03:58:06.900]  And we have the amazing Activated Charcoal Toothpaste,
[03:58:06.900 --> 03:58:08.900]  again, with a whole bunch of key essential oils
[03:58:08.900 --> 03:58:10.900]  that are so good, not just for your teeth and your gums,
[03:58:10.900 --> 03:58:12.900]  but your whole mouth, your throat, and more.
[03:58:12.900 --> 03:58:14.900]  These are really game-changing toothpastes.
[03:58:14.900 --> 03:58:16.900]  They're very, very strong.
[03:58:16.900 --> 03:58:18.900]  Most over-the-counter toothpastes have fluoride.
[03:58:18.900 --> 03:58:19.900]  Ours don't.
[03:58:19.900 --> 03:58:21.900]  And it doesn't have fillers in it.
[03:58:21.900 --> 03:58:24.900]  It is just chock-full of incredible things
[03:58:24.900 --> 03:58:26.900]  that God gave us through Mother Nature.
[03:58:26.900 --> 03:58:28.900]  So, it's now back in stock.
[03:58:28.900 --> 03:58:30.900]  It became a bestseller.
[03:58:30.900 --> 03:58:33.900]  The Tumor Toothpaste is available again at mfullerstore.com.
[03:58:33.900 --> 03:58:35.900]  We're selling out of the Tooth Whitening Toothpaste.
[03:58:35.900 --> 03:58:36.900]  We've got some of that left.
[03:58:36.900 --> 03:58:37.900]  And we also have some of the amazing
[03:58:37.900 --> 03:58:39.900]  Activated Charcoal Toothpaste in stock,
[03:58:39.900 --> 03:58:40.900]  but it's running out as well.
[03:58:40.900 --> 03:58:42.900]  So, all three toothpastes in stock for a limited time,
[03:58:42.900 --> 03:58:44.900]  mfullerstore.com.
[03:58:46.900 --> 03:58:47.900]  I want to thank all of you over the years

[03:58:51.900 --> 03:58:54.900]  All the success that we've had together against the globalists,
[03:58:54.900 --> 03:58:56.900]  and the fact that we're not caught flat-footed
[03:58:56.900 --> 03:58:59.900]  during their major takeover is because of you.
[03:58:59.900 --> 03:59:02.900]  Humanity has a real fighting chance.
[03:59:02.900 --> 03:59:04.900]  I just want to thank you all for buying products

[03:59:05.900 --> 03:59:07.900]  like books and films and supplements
[03:59:07.900 --> 03:59:09.900]  and water filtration, air filtration, and so much more.
[03:59:09.900 --> 03:59:11.900]  But for those of you that want to actually give us
[03:59:11.900 --> 03:59:13.900]  a straight donation so we get almost 100% of the money

[03:59:28.900 --> 03:59:29.900]  I want to thank all of you that have donated.
[03:59:29.900 --> 03:59:31.900]  I want to encourage those of you out there
[03:59:31.900 --> 03:59:33.900]  that want to support Freedom to take action now
