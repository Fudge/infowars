[00:00.000 --> 00:29.300]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:29.300 --> 00:41.760]  Ladies and gentlemen, we're now only 36 days out from this historic election and the attempts
[00:41.760 --> 00:46.760]  to shut down sovereignty, the attempts to shut down free speech have obviously gone
[00:46.760 --> 00:55.280]  beyond overdrive into just a frothing complete and total hysteria.
[00:55.280 --> 00:58.760]  But there will always be a major backlash to any of these type of actions and we'll
[00:58.760 --> 01:06.320]  be here quarterbacking the resistance against this tyranny and not ever compromising because
[01:06.320 --> 01:08.400]  that's our job.
[01:08.400 --> 01:11.880]  Now the president has been speaking at length in a press conference, we're going to come
[01:11.880 --> 01:18.080]  back and air it from the beginning about the renegotiation of NAFTA.
[01:18.080 --> 01:23.080]  Some patriot groups are spinning it as if the president has betrayed us, that's always
[01:23.080 --> 01:24.080]  a tactic used.
[01:24.080 --> 01:30.960]  A lot of the so-called opposition to globalism is really loyal opposition and then always
[01:30.960 --> 01:36.320]  says every move by those of us actually taking back the country and the world is some type
[01:36.320 --> 01:39.040]  of scam or betrayal.
[01:39.040 --> 01:44.120]  But you know Trump's for real because the globalists are trying to destroy him and because
[01:44.120 --> 01:48.760]  trillions of dollars of money is now coming back into the United States.
[01:48.760 --> 01:54.120]  And when Trump lowered corporate income taxes from 40% to 15, China went from 15 to 0 to
[01:54.120 --> 01:58.080]  counter that and has announced other tax cuts.
[01:58.080 --> 02:02.600]  China has lower taxes than we have in this country and they're communist.
[02:02.600 --> 02:03.600]  How is that?
[02:03.600 --> 02:05.100]  Because they're not communist.
[02:05.100 --> 02:12.320]  They are a corporate fascist system using communist tactics on low level populations.
[02:12.320 --> 02:23.040]  So we have Trump signing it, we have the stock market soaring because it means we're not
[02:23.040 --> 02:26.760]  going to have one-sided deals anymore.
[02:26.760 --> 02:31.680]  Look at Trump's renegotiation with China who has a $900 billion trade deficit if you had
[02:31.680 --> 02:37.920]  an election property in and everything the president's done has just clawed back some
[02:37.920 --> 02:43.760]  of the jobs and some of the money and at least start negotiations and we hold all the cards
[02:43.760 --> 02:48.280]  because it's been a one-way street and so China is having to capitulate but Trump isn't
[02:48.280 --> 02:55.800]  just getting a little bit back from him, he's getting a very large pound of flesh back.
[02:55.800 --> 03:02.760]  So Trump is hailing that historic trade deal, Canada refused for over a month to be part
[03:02.760 --> 03:04.760]  of it.
[03:04.760 --> 03:11.520]  Kudow ran his mouth but now he's been forced to the table and they've agreed on the skeleton
[03:11.520 --> 03:16.960]  of the agreement and now we're going to negotiate each piece of trade as it comes along, not
[03:16.960 --> 03:24.120]  transfer unilateral power to a bunch of lobbyists, a bunch of law firms in Mexico City, New York,
[03:24.120 --> 03:31.920]  DC, Toronto, Ottawa, London, England and that's what these guys really hate is.
[03:31.920 --> 03:35.600]  They like to shell off Western nations in one side of deals because that's where all
[03:35.600 --> 03:36.600]  the wealth's been.
[03:36.600 --> 03:40.600]  Well, most of the wealth already got sold off so we've got pretty close to rock bottom
[03:40.600 --> 03:45.080]  and so thank God Trump came along at that time to start reversing this because they
[03:45.080 --> 03:49.640]  were telling us about austerity and how fun it is and how cool it is and look at pretty
[03:49.640 --> 03:55.760]  boy Kudow, you know his daddy was the Canadian prime minister so everything's okay, just
[03:55.760 --> 03:58.600]  bend over, he'll take good care of you.
[03:58.600 --> 04:05.640]  Dow jumps for the 250 points after the U.S. and Canada secure a deal to replace NAFTA.
[04:05.640 --> 04:09.920]  So I will be again playing the president's comments that are still ongoing, I'm going
[04:09.920 --> 04:13.840]  to back up to the beginning when we come back and then you know it was coming.
[04:13.840 --> 04:25.200]  They're moving away from more made up sex assault stories from CIA officers to, oh he
[04:25.200 --> 04:32.360]  perjured himself, someone at Yale says 34 years ago someone got in Kavanaugh's face
[04:32.360 --> 04:36.720]  so he threw beer in their face so now, and you saw Saturday Night Live, at least I did,
[04:36.720 --> 04:41.440]  it's all about how Kavanaugh is a drunk so now they've moved over to the fact that he's
[04:41.440 --> 04:49.800]  supposedly a drunk and you know 30 years ago, 35 years ago drank a beer, it's incredible.
[04:49.800 --> 04:55.280]  So we'll be looking at all of that straight ahead, it's an amazing time to be alive and
[04:55.280 --> 05:00.600]  it's great to be fighting back and winning, stay with us.
[05:00.600 --> 05:05.120]  Whether you're looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula or just want an alternative,

[05:42.920 --> 05:48.160]  benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified high quality Crill Oil concentrate,

[05:55.160 --> 06:20.440]  at InfowarsStore.com.
[06:25.160 --> 06:33.680]  It's Monday, October 1st, 2018, coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas with
[06:33.680 --> 06:41.640]  only 36 days left until the most historic election in world history, a referendum on
[06:41.640 --> 06:49.560]  nationalism and self-determination and free market versus globalism, crony capitalism
[06:49.560 --> 06:54.960]  outlawed by the authoritarian states, suppressing the world population.
[06:54.960 --> 07:00.800]  Just minutes ago, the president signed a renegotiated deal with Mexico and Canada.
[07:00.800 --> 07:04.960]  Canada had promised to never sign the agreement and never cut their tariffs that were as high
[07:04.960 --> 07:09.000]  as 280% when the U.S. had no tariffs on them.
[07:09.000 --> 07:14.680]  But under pressure from the biggest economy in the world still, little Trudeau fell to
[07:14.680 --> 07:16.760]  his knees.
[07:16.760 --> 07:22.320]  Now the deal is basically to create a level playing field with Mexico and Canada, cutting
[07:22.320 --> 07:27.280]  out the law firms and the lobbyists, and that's why they want Trump dead and letting the actual
[07:27.280 --> 07:33.880]  free trade create incredible dynamos for all the populations of North America.
[07:33.880 --> 07:40.080]  You've seen him renegotiate all these deals, pull us out of the TPP, renegotiate deals
[07:40.080 --> 07:45.920]  with China, and the announcement that America is back for business has happened and it's
[07:45.920 --> 07:46.920]  very, very exciting.
[07:46.920 --> 07:51.440]  It doesn't mean this deal will be perfect, it doesn't mean it will all get executed
[07:51.440 --> 07:55.640]  absolutely perfectly, but I trust the president will now see what unfolds.
[07:55.640 --> 08:01.240]  Dow jumps more than 250 points after the U.S. and Canada secure a deal to replace Naftab.
[08:01.240 --> 08:05.800]  Stocks rose sharply Monday as investors cheered news of Canada joining a trade deal with the
[08:05.800 --> 08:07.160]  United States and Mexico.
[08:07.160 --> 08:12.360]  The Dow Jones industrial average rose 264 points as American Express in Boeing outperformed.
[08:12.360 --> 08:18.360]  The S&P 500 gained 0.8% led by 1% jumps in markets, materials, and industrials.
[08:18.360 --> 08:24.840]  The Nasdaq composite advanced 0.7 as Amazon and Apple both climbed more than 1%.
[08:24.840 --> 08:28.680]  The biggest risk in the market is a trade war and we've dialed that down a bit, said
[08:28.680 --> 08:33.880]  Mike Bailey, director of FBB Capital Partners.
[08:33.880 --> 08:40.920]  America is now open for business, for real business, not the D.C. and New York scumbag
[08:40.920 --> 08:44.040]  lobbyist that have been selling this country out.
[08:44.040 --> 08:48.720]  One-sided deals with the EU, one-sided deals with the Chai comms, one-sided deals with
[08:48.720 --> 08:52.680]  Mexico and Canada, everyone laughing at us.
[08:52.680 --> 08:58.320]  Because the globalists under the Rockefellers have a public policy of deindustrialization
[08:58.320 --> 09:06.440]  of the United States and Western Europe to bring us to heel like dogs, and they have
[09:06.440 --> 09:11.120]  sold off our wealth and made trillions of dollars, and we're going to accelerate and
[09:11.120 --> 09:15.920]  shut down all industrial activities in the United States.
[09:15.920 --> 09:22.640]  But that attempt has blown up in their face and America is back.
[09:22.640 --> 09:27.720]  I want to go to some of the ongoing speech of the president, we're going to go back
[09:27.720 --> 09:32.600]  to the beginning of it 15 minutes ago, and then the signing and then we're going to dig
[09:32.600 --> 09:37.000]  into it some and then the bad news, which we knew was coming.
[09:37.000 --> 09:41.480]  Cabinon was a heavy drinker, often belligerent at Yale, but there's never any reports of
[09:41.480 --> 09:42.880]  it.
[09:42.880 --> 09:49.520]  North Carolina professor says, well, someone who claims to knowing from Yale says someone
[09:49.520 --> 09:52.720]  got in Cabinon's face and got arrested.
[09:52.720 --> 09:56.400]  Oh, not Cabinon, there's no arrest records.
[09:56.400 --> 10:01.320]  I don't care if someone got in Cabinon's face and he broke their job, they started it,
[10:01.320 --> 10:04.640]  but none of this holds water does it, ladies and gentlemen.
[10:04.640 --> 10:12.160]  But now you see Nadler, the rest of the scumbags and the Democratic Party are saying, oh, he
[10:12.160 --> 10:17.360]  claimed he never passed out in high school or college, but what if they find someone
[10:17.360 --> 10:18.920]  that says they did?
[10:18.920 --> 10:24.560]  He says, he says, there's no statute of limitations anymore, of course there is, and there's no
[10:24.560 --> 10:28.040]  innocent until proven guilty, and there's no, look at somebody's record, look at the
[10:28.040 --> 10:33.880]  Democrats' record of being a bunch of lying scumbags, no, no, no, now it's perjury.
[10:33.880 --> 10:39.880]  Even though the former prosecutor, the current prosecutor that questioned Ms. Ford says,
[10:39.880 --> 10:44.120]  and we've got a big article on infowars.com, we're going to go over it, all the time she
[10:44.120 --> 10:52.440]  changed her story, it's flabbergasting, but let's go to the president from the Rose Garden
[10:52.440 --> 10:55.320]  just a little while ago on NAFTA.
[10:55.320 --> 10:57.640]  This is so incredibly exciting.
[10:57.640 --> 11:03.920]  It's really great to see everybody on this beautiful, beautiful day in Washington, D.C.
[11:03.920 --> 11:08.680]  Some people say the swamp, but I will not say that today.
[11:08.680 --> 11:09.680]  I refuse.
[11:09.680 --> 11:14.320]  This is too important to what we're doing, one of the most important deals and the most
[11:14.320 --> 11:16.880]  important trade deal we've ever made by far.
[11:16.880 --> 11:19.880]  I want to thank Senator Joni Ernst for being here.
[11:19.880 --> 11:23.560]  Joni, thank you very much of Iowa, and I'll be there very soon.
[11:23.560 --> 11:28.440]  We'll be doing something very important in Iowa, but this is maybe more important than
[11:28.440 --> 11:30.320]  all of it put together, right Joni?
[11:30.320 --> 11:33.880]  So I want to thank you for being here.
[11:33.880 --> 11:40.600]  Congressman Holding, Congressman Rowe, Congressman Newhouse, and Congressman Meadows, thank you
[11:40.600 --> 11:41.600]  all for being here.
[11:41.600 --> 11:42.600]  We very much appreciate it.
[11:42.600 --> 11:43.600]  You've been very instrumental.
[11:43.600 --> 11:44.600]  Thank you.
[11:44.600 --> 11:56.640]  I'm thrilled to speak to the American people to share truly historic news for our nation
[11:56.640 --> 11:58.680]  and indeed for the world.
[11:58.680 --> 12:03.360]  I want to thank Vice President Pence for joining us this morning.
[12:03.360 --> 12:09.840]  It's my great honor to announce that we have successfully completed negotiations on a brand
[12:09.840 --> 12:18.800]  new deal to terminate and replace NAFTA and the NAFTA trade agreements with an incredible
[12:18.800 --> 12:34.800]  new U.S., Mexico, Canada agreement called USMCA, sort of just works, MCA, USMCA, and that'll
[12:34.800 --> 12:41.240]  be the name I guess that 99% of the time we'll be hearing USMCA has a good ring to it.
[12:41.240 --> 12:47.440]  I have long contended that NAFTA was perhaps the worst trade deal ever made.
[12:47.440 --> 12:51.800]  Since NAFTA's adoption, the United States racked up trade deficits totaling more than
[12:51.800 --> 12:56.160]  $2 trillion, and it's a much higher number than that.
[12:56.160 --> 13:03.800]  With Canada and Mexico, it lost vast amounts of money and lost 4.1 million manufacturing
[13:03.800 --> 13:07.320]  jobs and 1 in 4 auto jobs.
[13:07.320 --> 13:12.240]  It was about 25% of our auto jobs, even more than that.
[13:12.240 --> 13:19.200]  Throughout the campaign, I promised to renegotiate NAFTA, and today we have kept that promise.
[13:19.200 --> 13:24.360]  But for 25 years as a civilian, as a businessman, I used to say, how could anybody have signed
[13:24.360 --> 13:26.200]  a deal like NAFTA?
[13:26.200 --> 13:31.520]  And I watched New England and so many other places where I was.
[13:31.520 --> 13:36.960]  The factories were leaving, the jobs were leaving, people were being fired, and we can't
[13:36.960 --> 13:37.960]  have that.
[13:37.960 --> 13:44.960]  So we have negotiated this new agreement based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity.
[13:44.960 --> 13:49.240]  To me, it's the most important word in trade, because we've been treated so unfairly by
[13:49.240 --> 13:53.320]  so many nations all over the world that we're changing that.
[13:53.320 --> 13:57.800]  We just signed a much better deal with South Korea.
[13:57.800 --> 14:03.320]  We had a horrible, horrible deal, and we just signed it at United Nations, and that's worked
[14:03.320 --> 14:04.320]  out well.
[14:04.320 --> 14:05.320]  And they're happy.
[14:05.320 --> 14:06.320]  We're happy.
[14:06.320 --> 14:08.380]  It's good for jobs, good for a lot of things.
[14:08.380 --> 14:16.520]  When that deal was signed, they said 250,000 jobs will be given by signing this transaction.
[14:16.520 --> 14:17.520]  They were right.
[14:17.520 --> 14:18.520]  I've said it before.
[14:18.520 --> 14:19.520]  They were right.
[14:19.520 --> 14:23.320]  250,000 jobs to South Korea, not to the United States.
[14:23.320 --> 14:28.000]  So that's changed, and very much for the better, and this one is a brand new deal.
[14:28.000 --> 14:33.640]  The agreement will govern nearly $1.2 trillion in trade, which makes it the biggest trade
[14:33.640 --> 14:37.400]  deal in the United States history.
[14:37.400 --> 14:42.760]  I want to congratulate U.S. Trade Representative Bob Lighthizer, who has worked.
[14:42.760 --> 14:50.320]  Nobody understands how hard he's worked.
[14:50.320 --> 15:01.120]  No matter when you called him, he was in the office, or he was in somebody else's office
[15:01.120 --> 15:02.120]  doing the same thing.
[15:02.120 --> 15:04.440]  Bob Lighthizer is great.
[15:04.440 --> 15:05.440]  I've heard it for years.
[15:05.440 --> 15:09.680]  I said, if I ever do this, I want to get Lighthizer to represent us, because he felt
[15:09.680 --> 15:11.520]  the way I did.
[15:11.520 --> 15:17.240]  And the entire team at the USTR standing behind me and some right here in the audience, I
[15:17.240 --> 15:18.240]  want to thank you all.
[15:18.240 --> 15:20.880]  We're going to go to break in a moment.
[15:20.880 --> 15:25.000]  He gets into the real meat and potatoes when we come back, and how this is different.
[15:25.000 --> 15:27.600]  And I've got a breakdown of the agreement that I'm going to be going over here, but
[15:27.600 --> 15:29.120]  just understand this.
[15:29.120 --> 15:36.160]  Before it was 100% one-sided, designed to deindustrialize the US, transfer our wealth
[15:36.160 --> 15:39.240]  into multinational corporations and the globalists.
[15:39.240 --> 15:42.600]  And now Merkel and the Chai comms and all of them are crapping their breaches, because
[15:42.600 --> 15:47.680]  we still hold all the cards, not for long, but we still held the cards, and now Trump
[15:47.680 --> 15:50.680]  is playing the cards and winning, winning, winning.
[15:50.680 --> 15:55.440]  That's what the Democrats and the state of California is waging war on America, because
[15:55.440 --> 15:59.600]  they are wholly owned subsidiaries of globalists and your enemy.
[15:59.600 --> 16:03.360]  Most of you know that heart disease is the number one silent killer in the US.
[16:03.360 --> 16:08.120]  What if I told you for just $54.95 a month, you could fight against heart disease naturally
[16:08.120 --> 16:10.040]  at Heart and Body Extract.
[16:10.040 --> 16:13.200]  We've been helping thousands of people get back to a healthier heart.

[17:28.680 --> 17:34.040]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[17:34.040 --> 17:35.040]  the world.
[17:35.040 --> 17:38.040]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars.
[17:38.040 --> 17:44.040]  The United States of Empire shows that World Wars I and II left England broken.
[17:44.040 --> 17:47.840]  Its former colony, the U.S., had to save the empire.
[17:47.840 --> 17:48.840]  Was there ever a vote?
[17:48.840 --> 17:50.400]  Who do we fight for?

[20:03.120 --> 20:22.800]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:22.800 --> 20:42.280]  Well, if you're looking on screen here on television, they've had Brett Kavanaugh release
[20:42.280 --> 20:48.560]  his personal calendars going back to 1981, well, Trump is beginning to release his personal
[20:48.560 --> 20:49.560]  calendars.
[20:49.560 --> 20:55.480]  If you're a TV viewer, you can see that it's starting with the month of July 2018 going
[20:55.480 --> 20:56.480]  back a few months.
[20:56.480 --> 21:00.960]  It says winning, winning, winning, winning, winning, winning, winning, winning, winning,
[21:00.960 --> 21:05.560]  winning, winning, I mean, winning every day of the week, but it is in different fonts,
[21:05.560 --> 21:07.360]  so there's different styles to that.
[21:07.360 --> 21:11.520]  We're not sure that's a type of racist white supremacist code or something.
[21:11.520 --> 21:16.760]  Like why is it cursive versus more of a conservative font later?
[21:16.760 --> 21:19.760]  The Democrats are looking closely into that right now.
[21:19.760 --> 21:24.680]  We're sure there's probably some type of code there, but Trump says everything's A-OK
[21:24.680 --> 21:29.920]  and we're going to really fix the economy, but he makes an OK sign like, boy, we have
[21:29.920 --> 21:32.840]  a really good chocolate cake at one of my resorts.
[21:32.840 --> 21:34.960]  I enjoyed it.
[21:34.960 --> 21:38.720]  Like the chef says, try the veal.
[21:38.720 --> 21:43.080]  Everybody knows the chef does the OK sign and then goes, it's really good, but that's
[21:43.080 --> 21:47.200]  probably white supremacist too, so let me just apologize, all communication, there's
[21:47.200 --> 21:50.760]  not Democrats or Hollywood is racist.
[21:50.760 --> 21:56.280]  Getting serious, Trump is winning, see, there you go, there's the white, the three fingers
[21:56.280 --> 21:59.280]  is the W and the O is power.
[21:59.280 --> 22:05.400]  So I told you it's the total proof everyone's making it, including Obama, which proves he's
[22:05.400 --> 22:06.920]  a white supremacist as well.
[22:06.920 --> 22:07.920]  Let's get serious.
[22:07.920 --> 22:12.360]  Dow Jones industrial average jumps more than 250 points after the U.S. account is secure,
[22:12.360 --> 22:17.280]  they deal to replace NAFTA, I have more remarks of the president made just minutes ago coming
[22:17.280 --> 22:18.960]  up, but I want to get to a few clips first.
[22:18.960 --> 22:24.040]  I have so many new clips, but I want to tie this all together right now.
[22:24.040 --> 22:28.120]  Trump slams China for election meddling, we'll get to that in a moment, but first, Trump
[22:28.120 --> 22:32.960]  at U.N., reject global governance, that means global government.
[22:32.960 --> 22:39.440]  Think about how far we've come as the Liberty Movement, as info wars, popularizing the truth
[22:39.440 --> 22:41.040]  of a corporate world government.
[22:41.040 --> 22:44.520]  That's why they hate info war so much.
[22:44.520 --> 22:48.600]  That's why they want us shut down, because we've been pointing out that it's China meddling
[22:48.600 --> 22:49.600]  on the election.
[22:49.600 --> 22:50.720]  Now they're getting caught.
[22:50.720 --> 22:55.200]  Now there's mainstream news articles, info wars, next year's news today.
[22:55.200 --> 22:59.120]  But I played this clip a lot since last week, and I'll play it again.
[22:59.120 --> 23:05.240]  This is why Merkel is absolutely panicking, Merkel fights for globalism, warns Trump against
[23:05.240 --> 23:09.040]  destroying the United Nations.
[23:09.040 --> 23:12.120]  The day after Trump won, they had the New York Times saying, what is globalism?
[23:12.120 --> 23:15.520]  And they said, Alex Jones invented the term, it does not exist.
[23:15.520 --> 23:19.920]  No, it's just what David Rockefeller called the system 50 years ago, if they were building.
[23:19.920 --> 23:23.720]  But they said, Alex Jones is evil, it doesn't exist.
[23:23.720 --> 23:26.400]  They were the laughing stock.
[23:26.400 --> 23:30.120]  So the New York Times and others said, let's just get Jones off the air.
[23:30.120 --> 23:34.640]  Hey, everything else from here is gravy, and I want to keep fighting.
[23:34.640 --> 23:40.960]  We've got some more big, you know, humps to get over here, but you guys are devastated.
[23:40.960 --> 23:45.840]  So you understand, I'm a winner, no matter what, I've done all this to expose you because
[23:45.840 --> 23:48.640]  you're authoritarian scum.
[23:48.640 --> 23:56.120]  Okay, you think you control reality, you don't.
[23:56.120 --> 24:00.040]  I'm trying to change the world, I'm not trying to coexist in your corrupt system where you
[24:00.040 --> 24:01.280]  don't let us coexist.
[24:01.280 --> 24:02.360]  But let's get back to the president.
[24:02.360 --> 24:12.560]  I'm going to surrender America's sovereignty to an unelected, unaccountable global bureaucracy.
[24:12.560 --> 24:16.440]  America is governed by Americans.
[24:16.440 --> 24:24.920]  We reject the ideology of globalism, and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism around
[24:24.920 --> 24:32.920]  the world, responsible nations must defend against threats to sovereignty, not just from
[24:32.920 --> 24:39.880]  global governments, but also from other new forms of coercion and domination.
[24:39.880 --> 24:41.280]  And that'd be big tech.
[24:41.280 --> 24:45.120]  So big tech is up next, because they're bigger than any government combined, and they are
[24:45.120 --> 24:48.720]  just acting like they're gods, so we'll see how that goes for them.
[24:48.720 --> 24:52.600]  And then of course, there's this clip, Trump slams China for election meddling, and then
[24:52.600 --> 24:55.720]  the media acted like they were dumb.
[24:55.720 --> 24:58.520]  Hollywood is now controlled by the Congress of Chinese, that's mainstream news, Wall
[24:58.520 --> 25:00.160]  Street Journal, New York Times.
[25:00.160 --> 25:04.280]  You heard it here from me first 10 years ago, so I had it directly from high-level Hollywood
[25:04.280 --> 25:05.280]  sources.
[25:05.280 --> 25:09.120]  They were buying up all the major production houses.
[25:09.120 --> 25:12.360]  Now they own the debt.
[25:12.360 --> 25:16.440]  They have 98% of the rare of minerals, they have the major shipping lanes, they're threatening
[25:16.440 --> 25:18.840]  to attack us constantly.
[25:18.840 --> 25:23.560]  They're taking control of all 50 public universities, that's even the Washington Post.
[25:23.560 --> 25:26.360]  And now we force that out in the open too.
[25:26.360 --> 25:30.920]  That's why we are Prasada non grata with the globalist, but here it is.
[25:30.920 --> 25:35.240]  U.S. Ambassador, China running propaganda ads on our own free press.
[25:35.240 --> 25:42.240]  The Hill reports that on top of having radio stations in Mexico beaming propaganda into
[25:42.240 --> 25:46.840]  the U.S.
[25:46.840 --> 25:51.720]  On top of that, they're now putting full page and four page spreads in major newspapers
[25:51.720 --> 25:59.440]  in places like Iowa saying don't have a trade war with communist China, let China have high
[25:59.440 --> 26:04.520]  tariffs on the U.S., your president's a bad person, and the Chinese government's paying
[26:04.520 --> 26:05.520]  for that.
[26:05.520 --> 26:08.240]  But they deny that that's election meddling.
[26:08.240 --> 26:16.320]  Huge spreads in newspapers saying your president is wrong and that's not election meddling.
[26:16.320 --> 26:20.200]  Imagine if the Russians were doing that.
[26:20.200 --> 26:25.080]  Lavaroff notes, that's the Russian Foreign Minister, that Trump blamed China, not Russia
[26:25.080 --> 26:29.880]  for U.S. election meddling, Reuters, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavaroff took pleasure
[26:29.880 --> 26:33.560]  pointing out on Friday that U.S. President Donald Trump this week accused China, not
[26:33.560 --> 26:38.640]  Russia, of interfering in the U.S. elections.
[26:38.640 --> 26:41.800]  He goes on to say the president's never blamed this, but here he is not blaming us again
[26:41.800 --> 26:46.680]  because the last thing we do is get involved in people's internal affairs.
[26:46.680 --> 26:52.280]  But China does, and see how sweet that is, that I've paid such a price and Imphal Wars
[26:52.280 --> 26:57.520]  has paid such a price to point out that it's China taking over the big banks, taking over
[26:57.520 --> 27:03.000]  Hollywood, taking over the universities, funding the real troops on the ground for the takedown
[27:03.000 --> 27:07.680]  of America and the sabotage of our country and the sexualization of children because
[27:07.680 --> 27:12.360]  they know it will sabotage your nation, China is funding it all, working with the big mega
[27:12.360 --> 27:18.120]  banks with the Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan's who've all bet against this country.
[27:18.120 --> 27:21.960]  But Trump is coming in and taking control of those institutions and now turning them
[27:21.960 --> 27:27.120]  against China and they are flipping out and all the people that bet against America and
[27:27.120 --> 27:33.720]  that sold this country out show their hatred of the nation and their vitriol as California
[27:33.720 --> 27:39.360]  and the Democrats and all their organs are at true war with this country, doing everything
[27:39.360 --> 27:44.400]  they can to sabotage this republic.
[27:44.400 --> 27:49.820]  California and its lawyers literally bombard the rest of the country with criminal activity
[27:49.820 --> 27:53.840]  shucking the other states dry and the most beautiful thing you could ever see is the
[27:53.840 --> 28:00.880]  mass exodus out of California, the total exodus out of California and it's soon to collapse
[28:00.880 --> 28:05.440]  and it will be reorganized and be brought back to the United States but right now California
[28:05.440 --> 28:09.760]  metaphysically is about to fall off in the ocean and politically and spiritually has
[28:09.760 --> 28:15.240]  fallen off in the ocean and wait till I get to some news on that, we're having a big California
[28:15.240 --> 28:19.840]  street show in San Francisco where people defecate into each other's mouths and bleed
[28:19.840 --> 28:24.800]  all over the place and urinate in each other's faces and don't worry I have the San Francisco
[28:24.800 --> 28:36.640]  Chronicle, children are taken to watch as their school field trips, oh it's in the newspaper,
[28:36.640 --> 28:42.000]  piles of feces everywhere just crapping on each other because this is what psychotic
[28:42.000 --> 28:47.600]  devil worship creates, it's all coming up more of the president's speech I promise and
[28:47.600 --> 28:54.600]  then oh a special banned video I did, it's all coming up, infowars.com, newswars.com,

[29:03.720 --> 29:07.680]  absorb so if the vitamins and supplements you now take are not being absorbed what good

[29:33.160 --> 29:37.960]  seize my mother's house, I sued the IRS in one, I beat the IRS then and I've been beating
[29:37.960 --> 29:42.000]  them ever since, I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people

[31:10.080 --> 31:16.400]  Several years ago I set out with top formulators in the US to create the strongest, most concentrated

[32:00.160 --> 32:05.360]  This cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[32:05.360 --> 32:09.760]  InfoWars is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt
[32:09.760 --> 32:13.160]  justice department and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[32:13.160 --> 32:17.120]  People say why would you start a fight with them because they were already dominating
[32:17.120 --> 32:21.520]  and running America into the ground and I knew we had no future if we didn't do this.
[32:21.520 --> 32:27.400]  So we've already had incredible success but if you will simply realize how epic this is
[32:27.400 --> 32:31.760]  and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target and if
[32:31.760 --> 32:37.720]  you financially support us and if you spread the word about our articles and videos infowars.com
[32:37.720 --> 32:42.640]  we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags, we'll win.
[32:42.640 --> 32:47.280]  We have huge sales at infowarsshore.com right now and we're still able to operate the shopping
[32:47.280 --> 32:50.720]  cart and get stuff shipped out to you despite the fact we're trying to block our commerce
[32:50.720 --> 32:55.080]  and you're right to the market but if you don't stand up and support us financially Soros
[32:55.080 --> 33:00.080]  and love will sting when this is infowars darkest hour we're your support I'm counting on you.
[33:25.080 --> 33:32.080]  Today, you're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:32.080 --> 33:43.080]  Regrettably we found that China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election
[33:43.080 --> 33:48.120]  coming up in November against my administration.
[33:48.120 --> 33:56.200]  They do not want me or us to win because I am the first president ever to challenge China
[33:56.200 --> 34:00.680]  on trade and we are winning on trade.
[34:00.680 --> 34:04.400]  We are winning at every level.
[34:04.400 --> 34:11.200]  If you're watching on television you can see the incredibly arrogant communist Chinese
[34:11.200 --> 34:14.800]  ambassador who knows full well they bought up Hollywood, he knows full well they bought
[34:14.800 --> 34:18.840]  up the national debt, he knows full well they made deals with the CFR to deindustrialize
[34:18.840 --> 34:19.840]  the country.
[34:19.840 --> 34:24.200]  It's the whole plan of world government, full page articles by David Rockefeller, dozens
[34:24.200 --> 34:29.320]  of times praising Mao Zedong, praising world government, praising the upcoming Chinese
[34:29.320 --> 34:35.200]  century, praising making it impossible to operate inside the US and now it's all over
[34:35.200 --> 34:41.120]  the news that China is buying off the leadership of major colleges and buying off the heads
[34:41.120 --> 34:46.680]  of major media and deeply involved in espionage against this country.
[34:46.680 --> 34:51.800]  But oh, the Chi-Kong ambassador that represents a country that's killed five times what Hitler
[34:51.800 --> 34:56.680]  did under the communist in their nation, he rolled his eyes.
[34:56.680 --> 35:07.560]  In fact, let's just play that clip of the president one more time, it's so delicious.
[35:07.560 --> 35:18.240]  Finally we found that China has been attempting to interfere in our upcoming 2018 election
[35:18.240 --> 35:23.160]  coming up in November against my administration.
[35:23.160 --> 35:30.680]  They do not want me or us to win because I am the first president ever to challenge
[35:30.680 --> 35:35.680]  China on trade and we are winning on trade.
[35:35.680 --> 35:38.720]  We are winning at every level.
[35:38.720 --> 35:42.400]  Thank God we finally got a president that was for the country and is just trying to
[35:42.400 --> 35:44.440]  make fair deals with these people.
[35:44.440 --> 35:51.320]  I mean, China is the most bloodthirsty evil country ever imagined and the biggest group
[35:51.320 --> 35:57.880]  of people coming here are Chinese women who are married and they come here and their babies
[35:57.880 --> 36:02.720]  are had here and their citizens and they get free birth and free welfare and their
[36:02.720 --> 36:07.160]  middle class and wealthy Chinese doing it like we're idiots.
[36:07.160 --> 36:08.840]  You go to China, you want anything free?
[36:08.840 --> 36:12.760]  They'll put you in a forced labor camp.
[36:12.760 --> 36:21.440]  China has been killing CIA officers and assets since Trump got in 20 months ago in mass.
[36:21.440 --> 36:27.040]  They've been vaporizing people's brain cells with microwave guns at the U.S. Embassy where
[36:27.040 --> 36:29.560]  we're having to close the U.S. Embassy in China.
[36:29.560 --> 36:32.160]  We are at war with China.
[36:32.160 --> 36:33.800]  We've been at war with China.
[36:33.800 --> 36:36.160]  We've been at war with the Council on Foreign Relations.
[36:36.160 --> 36:37.840]  We've been at war with Hollywood.
[36:37.840 --> 36:39.320]  They are the enemy.
[36:39.320 --> 36:46.240]  Hollywood, the CFR, the left, the big New York banks, the scumbag DC law firms, the
[36:46.240 --> 36:51.040]  stay-behind networks and the CIA, they are at war with you.
[36:51.040 --> 36:54.080]  They are hired and trained to hate this country.
[36:54.080 --> 36:56.680]  They are hired and trained to hate your family.
[36:56.680 --> 36:59.360]  They are hired and trained to hate your success.
[36:59.360 --> 37:02.960]  They are hired and trained to suck you dry.
[37:02.960 --> 37:10.920]  The litmus test is how enthusiastically you hate this nation, and they hate black people
[37:10.920 --> 37:11.920]  more than anybody.
[37:11.920 --> 37:16.240]  They want to keep them incredibly poor, totally controlled and inner cities, so the left can
[37:16.240 --> 37:20.640]  activate folks to burn down cities whenever they want them to, just like they bring in
[37:20.640 --> 37:25.360]  uneducated North African populations into Europe and don't let them get jobs or anything
[37:25.360 --> 37:32.480]  and make them stay in squalor so they politically control them as a political weapon.
[37:32.480 --> 37:36.320]  That's how this works.
[37:36.320 --> 37:40.400]  And you get the secret Obama recordings and the Hillary recordings and the WikiLeaks and
[37:40.400 --> 37:43.640]  it's black people can't have cars and air conditioning.
[37:43.640 --> 37:46.120]  Hell, Obama said that in public before, too.
[37:46.120 --> 37:48.160]  We got to keep them on our system.
[37:48.160 --> 37:51.600]  We got to keep them under our control.
[37:51.600 --> 37:53.280]  We got to keep them in prison longer.
[37:53.280 --> 37:58.680]  All the Democrats did that, and then Kanye West tries to do something about it, tries
[37:58.680 --> 38:04.520]  to get black people out of prison, and he's anti-black now because he's trying to take
[38:04.520 --> 38:07.320]  action and actually do something.
[38:07.320 --> 38:12.240]  He's the bad guy, so they cut most of his appearance at Saturday Night Live, thought
[38:12.240 --> 38:16.720]  it was live, not when Kanye's there, so they cut most of the performance because he wouldn't
[38:16.720 --> 38:19.560]  take the Make America Great Again hat off.
[38:19.560 --> 38:26.040]  How dare him do that because they're going to bring America down because the Chai comms
[38:26.040 --> 38:32.120]  were chosen as the perfect little murdering babies to be given everything because they
[38:32.120 --> 38:35.920]  were good little authoritarians.
[38:35.920 --> 38:40.960]  When we upload these live clips to video.infohors.com, I'll put more Trump's full speech up there,
[38:40.960 --> 38:47.200]  and I've got some of the clips coming up, but I need to get to the Kavanaugh situation,
[38:47.200 --> 38:50.040]  which is out of control, and then some good news.
[38:50.040 --> 38:52.200]  I've got some really good news.
[38:52.200 --> 38:57.320]  Father of the Web reveals planned to take back Internet from Big Tech Centralized Control
[38:57.320 --> 38:58.320]  Fast Company.
[38:58.320 --> 39:03.680]  I know it's not Al Gore, it's the real inventor of the Internet.
[39:03.680 --> 39:08.600]  One of the guys who's recognized as being the key mover in it all, 40 years ago.
[39:08.600 --> 39:13.960]  Father of the World Wide Web launches a platform which aims to radically decentralize the Web.
[39:13.960 --> 39:21.520]  He says Big Tech is authoritarian, is dangerous, and is robbing you of your freedom, and now
[39:21.520 --> 39:25.360]  working to censor the Web, and he has a plan he's been quietly working on for years that
[39:25.360 --> 39:28.920]  launches in a month.
[39:28.920 --> 39:29.920]  And it's all coming up.
[39:29.920 --> 39:33.720]  It's a similar plan that we've had other experts on, like McAfee and others, that have called
[39:33.720 --> 39:38.560]  for something similar, but this is going to have giant, big backing, and already Google
[39:38.560 --> 39:42.320]  and Facebook and others don't want to allow you to have this.
[39:42.320 --> 39:50.800]  Of course, of course they don't, because they've stolen the Internet.
[39:50.800 --> 39:56.920]  So get ready, ladies and gentlemen, it's quite a time to be alive now.
[39:56.920 --> 40:00.440]  Remember the globalist doing everything they can to shut down this broadcast, doing everything
[40:00.440 --> 40:03.640]  they can to keep you from having free speech.
[40:03.640 --> 40:06.840]  And the biggest form of speech you've got is financial.
[40:06.840 --> 40:11.520]  When you support a certain company or withdraw a certain support from a company, or support
[40:11.520 --> 40:16.360]  a certain statesman, but don't support a certain scumbag politician, that changes the
[40:16.360 --> 40:17.360]  world.
[40:17.360 --> 40:19.080]  And that's why they're trying to take our financing away.
[40:19.080 --> 40:26.280]  It's why they're trying to take our self-funding, selling you high-quality products at infoworshtore.com.
[40:26.280 --> 40:30.880]  That's why on the fourth, PayPal withdraws our merchant banking.
[40:30.880 --> 40:34.960]  We have backups, but the enemy's going after those as well.
[40:34.960 --> 40:39.200]  So I will tell you, tomorrow is the last day that we're going to allow PayPal, and then
[40:39.200 --> 40:40.200]  I'm going to remove it.
[40:40.200 --> 40:44.280]  So I'm not going to give them a chance for any funds that come in for them to take them.
[40:44.280 --> 40:50.980]  So if you want to support InfoWars, have a PayPal wallet, and want to delete that authoritarian
[40:50.980 --> 40:54.920]  market the beast system where they want to use the casual society to control political
[40:54.920 --> 40:59.200]  thought, go to infoworshtore.com today.
[40:59.200 --> 41:06.400]  Get water filtration, air filtration, supplements, books, films, t-shirts, you name it, and then
[41:06.400 --> 41:10.440]  transfer your money out of there that you don't spend at infoworshtore.com and shut
[41:10.440 --> 41:11.440]  down your PayPal.
[41:11.440 --> 41:16.400]  I had a sneak and suspicion source that was involved, and I searched his name and turned
[41:16.400 --> 41:19.640]  out he bought a large interest in it one month before this happened.
[41:19.640 --> 41:23.640]  I'm sending him to Facebook, you name it.
[41:23.640 --> 41:28.440]  So again, the last day is tomorrow.
[41:28.440 --> 41:31.720]  They say it is Thursday, but I'm not going to give it that long.
[41:31.720 --> 41:37.560]  We're removing PayPal tomorrow at midnight central at infoworshtore.com.
[41:37.560 --> 41:42.680]  We have other credit card systems and things you can use there as well, but the enemy is
[41:42.680 --> 41:45.840]  targeting those as well.
[41:45.840 --> 41:52.080]  So please visit infoworshtore.com and infowarslife.com today.

[42:41.040 --> 42:47.400]  97% reviews on power reviews and other sites, we'll be back too because I didn't have time
[42:47.400 --> 42:51.120]  to tell you about our newest product, I'll spend a little bit of time on that and then
[42:51.120 --> 42:59.520]  get into the latest on Kavanaugh, it is, as we expected, unbelievably criminal.
[42:59.520 --> 43:03.360]  Living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is.
[43:03.360 --> 43:07.880]  The real drama can be found here in Leilani Estates, but a lot of us on the Big Island
[43:07.880 --> 43:13.320]  rely on rainwater, and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain.
[43:13.320 --> 43:18.720]  Big ash may contain heavy metal particles, and acid rain could lower the pH of the water
[43:18.720 --> 43:20.240]  to unhealthy levels.
[43:20.240 --> 43:26.760]  To find out, we employed a series of tests for heavy metals, alkalinity, and pH.
[43:26.760 --> 43:30.720]  What we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity
[43:30.720 --> 43:32.200]  in the rainwater.
[43:32.200 --> 43:37.440]  Next, we tested the water from our Alexa Pure Gravity Filter, and not only were the heavy
[43:37.440 --> 43:43.520]  metal levels within safe measure, but the pH was also restored to optimal levels.
[43:43.520 --> 43:49.160]  As it turns out, the filter on the Alexa Pure raises the pH of the water, so what we've
[43:49.160 --> 43:54.480]  learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply.
[43:54.480 --> 43:59.520]  But more importantly, a good water filtration system will purify it.
[43:59.520 --> 44:04.400]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[44:04.400 --> 44:08.840]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress, you may not be able to get all
[44:08.840 --> 44:13.320]  the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[44:13.320 --> 44:19.120]  That's why Infowars Life created the powerful Vitamin Mineral Fusion Formula, the new platinum
[44:19.120 --> 44:22.520]  standard of advanced multivitamin formulation.
[44:22.520 --> 44:27.280]  Vitamin Mineral Fusion uses a unique delivery system to maximize the effects and give your
[44:27.280 --> 44:30.280]  body the tools it needs to support your body.

[44:53.000 --> 45:00.560]  Mineral Fusion today, available at InfowarsStore.com.
[45:00.560 --> 45:04.920]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or
[45:04.920 --> 45:09.160]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dog for a walk.
[45:09.160 --> 45:13.320]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright
[45:13.320 --> 45:20.440]  lights every day, but thanks to SupermailVitality at InfowarsStore.com, I still have that energy.
[45:20.440 --> 45:24.640]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against
[45:24.640 --> 45:28.800]  the chemicals in the food and water, to fight back against the modern-day lifestyle with
[45:28.800 --> 45:34.080]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy,
[45:34.080 --> 45:41.040]  and drive to get to the gym, get to the park, and get exercise that you need for your health.

[46:59.920 --> 47:11.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:11.240 --> 47:16.920]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[47:16.920 --> 47:24.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[47:24.680 --> 47:30.440]  Faith Goldie is a patriot, a Trump supporter, a constitutionalist, a libertarian who lives
[47:30.440 --> 47:32.680]  in Canada.
[47:32.680 --> 47:36.880]  And she is number three in major polls out of six people running for mayor, but they
[47:36.880 --> 47:43.000]  don't let her attend any of the televised debates because she's good-looking and well-spoken
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.800]  and popular because they know she'll win.
[47:45.800 --> 47:51.360]  So she just took over the live event and they've had a lot of trouble memory-holing that.
[47:51.360 --> 47:56.960]  So she's going to be joining us for 30 minutes or longer, start of the next hour.
[47:56.960 --> 48:09.600]  And Kevin Jackson, a former Fox News fired for saying that Dr. Ford is a lying opportunist,
[48:09.600 --> 48:10.600]  in his opinion.
[48:10.600 --> 48:21.280]  In fact, the New York Times said you can't even question, you can't even question whether
[48:21.280 --> 48:23.720]  her testimony was credible now.
[48:23.720 --> 48:29.520]  You can question Cabinol, but just no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[48:29.520 --> 48:31.960]  Women are in a man's world, but it's beyond chivalry.
[48:31.960 --> 48:36.320]  They're just anything they say is true, even if they are the recruiting officer for the
[48:36.320 --> 48:42.120]  CIA at her college and her dad and grandfather on the CIA and her brother and that Baker
[48:42.120 --> 48:48.000]  Hostetler that first cooked up the fake Russiagate dossier.
[48:48.000 --> 48:56.600]  It doesn't matter, ladies and gentlemen, because she's a stuttering, bumbling blue blood.
[48:56.600 --> 49:00.600]  And so we've got to just bow down before her and doesn't matter her whole story, has more
[49:00.600 --> 49:08.520]  holes in it than Swiss cheese, you have to bow to her.
[49:08.520 --> 49:12.280]  And there have been some shocking new developments on that front we're going to get to here in
[49:12.280 --> 49:18.560]  just a moment, hashtag, kill Cabinol as the top search term on Twitter.
[49:18.560 --> 49:22.880]  And the left's defending it and they let the main Antifa group that says they're going
[49:22.880 --> 49:26.200]  to kill the president, the vice president publicly and who said they're going to kill
[49:26.200 --> 49:29.840]  people that work at the restaurant that served Ted Cruz.
[49:29.840 --> 49:32.200]  They're allowed to operate on Twitter with hundreds of thousands of followers.
[49:32.200 --> 49:33.200]  We are not.
[49:33.200 --> 49:38.960]  Again, this is the just absolute authoritarianism and the arrogance of Big Tech helping crush
[49:38.960 --> 49:45.120]  people in China, crush people in the Middle East, crush people in authoritarian EU, and
[49:45.120 --> 49:49.520]  now crushing Americans.
[49:49.520 --> 49:53.800]  And I went to this event that was called Understand the Rhetoric of Donald Trump and Alex Jones
[49:53.800 --> 49:55.960]  this weekend.
[49:55.960 --> 50:02.560]  City sponsored, sponsored by Walmart, blocked off streets in front of the Capitol, big stage.
[50:02.560 --> 50:06.280]  Out of 100 drooling leftists showed up to it, looked like a collection of people that
[50:06.280 --> 50:13.840]  escaped a mental institution, and I looked at Charlie Weasel and others from BuzzFeed
[50:13.840 --> 50:18.560]  that he openly works for Soros and helps run the censorship and he helps go find anything
[50:18.560 --> 50:24.360]  where I'm on the web and not just on the platform from platforms, but anybody else
[50:24.360 --> 50:26.160]  even tries to talk positively.
[50:26.160 --> 50:27.160]  They're taken down.
[50:27.160 --> 50:28.360]  He has a little magic wand.
[50:28.360 --> 50:36.000]  He just sat there just like a retarded nobleman, like smiling and I knew I said, somebody's
[50:36.000 --> 50:40.480]  going to put this on YouTube and somebody did and had over 100,000 views and I just
[50:40.480 --> 50:45.560]  know it was where Zell went in a little database and had it removed because that's who they
[50:45.560 --> 50:46.560]  admit does it.
[50:46.560 --> 50:51.040]  It's the selected worst fake news out there, BuzzFeed is like knighted like the Southern
[50:51.040 --> 50:54.400]  Provincial Law Center and media matters.
[50:54.400 --> 51:00.400]  And then he brags that he runs around and polices and he has the magic wand and says,
[51:00.400 --> 51:01.400]  this is fake news.
[51:01.400 --> 51:06.160]  Jones coming to an event named after him and we're defaming him and bullharding us.
[51:06.160 --> 51:07.680]  That won't be seen on YouTube.
[51:07.680 --> 51:09.960]  We'll have it deleted.
[51:09.960 --> 51:19.040]  And they said the terms of service of the YouTube channel that had it were removed.
[51:19.040 --> 51:20.040]  Isn't that just special?
[51:20.040 --> 51:21.040]  That's a side issue.
[51:21.040 --> 51:26.800]  But at the bottom of the next hour or the last segment, at least hold Goldie over, we
[51:26.800 --> 51:32.760]  will get to, we will get to the 10 minutes of when I went in there and bullhorned them
[51:32.760 --> 51:37.080]  and then the police came and then I bullhorned them across the street and it doesn't matter
[51:37.080 --> 51:44.440]  because we have the video on MFullHorse.com and it's going viral to the four winds.
[51:44.440 --> 51:52.280]  But I forgot the name of the YouTube site that it said terms of service, which one
[51:52.280 --> 52:02.720]  was it just somewhere to mention it because they dared, you know, they dared in America
[52:02.720 --> 52:03.720]  engage in free speech.
[52:03.720 --> 52:10.480]  So the screenshot of it, yes, it's General Shepard.
[52:10.480 --> 52:16.480]  You could go and so I was reading about the guys have like 20 accounts and they keep deleting
[52:16.480 --> 52:17.480]  them.
[52:17.480 --> 52:18.480]  People know General Shepard.
[52:18.480 --> 52:21.880]  So they searched that and then he gets like 50,000 subscribers in a couple of days and
[52:21.880 --> 52:22.880]  then they delete that.
[52:22.880 --> 52:30.960]  It's just so authoritarian that I, it's true that if you put out pro Alex Jones stuff,
[52:30.960 --> 52:34.880]  in most cases, they will delete your channel.
[52:34.880 --> 52:38.160]  Even though our stuff's all free to air, everybody can use it.
[52:38.160 --> 52:41.920]  That's the authoritarianism of not just Oh, it's their private platform.
[52:41.920 --> 52:42.920]  They can do what they want.
[52:42.920 --> 52:49.480]  No, they have big dying media working with a Democratic Party calling for us to be removed.
[52:49.480 --> 52:54.680]  And then they lie and slander and defame you and then remove your channel.
[52:54.680 --> 52:59.040]  And then if someone else gets a video of a public event, how newsworthy is that an event
[52:59.040 --> 53:04.920]  about me slandering me and I show up to it and then they remove it.
[53:04.920 --> 53:09.840]  I mean, just the incredible dirt baggery of that.
[53:09.840 --> 53:16.400]  But I'll talk about it more when I play it coming up and again, it said it violated their
[53:16.400 --> 53:17.400]  community standards.
[53:17.400 --> 53:21.600]  Democrats can come shouting everybody's face and take over events and getting Ted Cruz's
[53:21.600 --> 53:24.880]  face and run him on a private restaurants, which I say is wrong to do.
[53:24.880 --> 53:29.680]  But I go to a public taxpayer funded event on the closed down streets of Austin with
[53:29.680 --> 53:35.440]  my name on it and I tell him, you're lying about me on this, you're lying about being
[53:35.440 --> 53:36.440]  on that.
[53:36.440 --> 53:42.000]  And it is memory hold because the new royalty is so arrogant.
[53:42.000 --> 53:53.800]  Now pride goeth before a fall show.
[53:53.800 --> 54:00.320]  We're going to be airing that coming up.
[54:00.320 --> 54:04.080]  And then again, the father of the web reveals plan to take back internet from big tech centralized
[54:04.080 --> 54:07.360]  control and the incredible censorship happening.
[54:07.360 --> 54:12.200]  That is Tim Berners Lee inventor of the worldwide web.
[54:12.200 --> 54:16.440]  I know liberals Al Gore said he did it, not no involvement at all.
[54:16.440 --> 54:18.680]  So that is going to be coming up.
[54:18.680 --> 54:23.760]  And you know, as I said, the latest on Kavanaugh, which is pretty spectacular.
[54:23.760 --> 54:37.440]  But I wanted to first tell you about our newest product, which I really can't do justice to
[54:37.440 --> 54:48.080]  here in just a few minutes, but obviously the FDA is in competition with mother nature.
[54:48.080 --> 54:52.120]  And so you just need to read the ingredients on here and do your own research for yourself.
[54:52.120 --> 54:55.640]  And I'm just going to tell you, they're very, very strong, they're very, very organic, they're

[55:27.440 --> 55:28.940]  your family.
[55:28.940 --> 55:34.520]  Whether it's for adults or children, try a bottle of HAPPIES today.
[55:34.520 --> 55:38.880]  Stress is a natural part of life, almost everything in our lives can put stress and
[55:38.880 --> 55:42.680]  pressure on our mind and bodies, making us sluggish, tired, and slow.
[55:42.680 --> 55:47.960]  We become less effective, moodier, and often seems overwhelming.
[55:47.960 --> 55:52.800]  That's why we work hard to make sure the incredible HAPPIES formula is filled with ingredients
[55:52.800 --> 55:55.440]  used traditionally for thousands of years.

[56:40.800 --> 56:44.400]  All these ingredients combine to create an incredible formula to help fuel the mind and
[56:44.400 --> 56:47.280]  body.

[59:47.000 --> 59:53.560]  We are the renaissance and we are winning.
[59:53.560 --> 1:00:04.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:04.080 --> 1:00:20.000]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[1:00:20.000 --> 1:00:25.840]  Well faith Goldie is fighting back against the censorship is taking place by mainstream
[1:00:25.840 --> 1:00:34.760]  media and is taking action and is taking action against the globalist attempt to shut down
[1:00:34.760 --> 1:00:35.760]  dissent.
[1:00:35.760 --> 1:00:39.680]  We're going to be talking to her coming up in the next segment, very, very exciting.
[1:00:39.680 --> 1:00:45.600]  What she's doing up in Toronto, Canada, running for mayor, but I wanted to keep celebrating
[1:00:45.600 --> 1:00:51.800]  what Trump did last week in front of the UN, calling out China for meddling in the election,
[1:00:51.800 --> 1:00:59.000]  what's it publicly doing and calling out globalism and big tech and all these big power brokers
[1:00:59.000 --> 1:01:04.080]  as the real enemy of humanity and the real authoritarianism.
[1:01:04.080 --> 1:01:06.840]  Because that's really the big threat.
[1:01:06.840 --> 1:01:11.160]  And they think America and the West, it's always been an opposition to authoritarianism
[1:01:11.160 --> 1:01:12.160]  is out of the game.
[1:01:12.160 --> 1:01:13.240]  We're not out of the game.
[1:01:13.240 --> 1:01:14.240]  We're getting back in the game.
[1:01:14.240 --> 1:01:20.840]  And the reason I've been censored and shut down and silenced over all is that I've been
[1:01:20.840 --> 1:01:26.320]  pointing out the China connection and the system doesn't want that.
[1:01:26.320 --> 1:01:31.560]  So here is a report again, pointing out we've now got a president of the United States of
[1:01:31.560 --> 1:01:35.360]  America who gets it and that's why the globalists are so scared.
[1:01:35.360 --> 1:01:38.880]  Steel is like the hottest industry there is.
[1:01:38.880 --> 1:01:43.640]  If you look at what happened with steel, we're charging a 25% tariff for the dumpers.
[1:01:43.640 --> 1:01:45.360]  They dump massive amounts of steel.
[1:01:45.360 --> 1:01:48.840]  They want to put the steel companies out of business and after they're out of business,
[1:01:48.840 --> 1:01:52.960]  they'll come in and charge five times more than you ever thought possible.
[1:01:52.960 --> 1:01:57.080]  U.S. steel is opening up a minimum of eight plants.
[1:01:57.080 --> 1:02:02.200]  New core is opening up plants and these are big plants, $750 million and a billion dollar
[1:02:02.200 --> 1:02:05.080]  plants in some cases.
[1:02:05.080 --> 1:02:08.200]  So what's happening with the steel industry is very exciting to me.
[1:02:08.200 --> 1:02:14.080]  And globalism is about slavery and our great president and his incredible courage just
[1:02:14.080 --> 1:02:19.560]  a few days ago pointed out that globalism and global governance is a world government
[1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:26.760]  system of oppression and that it is slavery and that's what world corporate government
[1:02:26.760 --> 1:02:27.760]  is.
[1:02:27.760 --> 1:02:28.760]  They're above the law.
[1:02:28.760 --> 1:02:29.760]  They pay no taxes.
[1:02:29.760 --> 1:02:30.760]  They have diplomatic immunity.
[1:02:30.760 --> 1:02:35.800]  They can do whatever they want and they think you and I have to just roll over whatever
[1:02:35.800 --> 1:02:36.800]  they're doing.
[1:02:36.800 --> 1:02:45.220]  One of us here today is the emissary of a distinct culture, a rich history and a people
[1:02:45.220 --> 1:02:52.640]  bound together by ties of memory, tradition and the values that make our homelands like
[1:02:52.640 --> 1:02:56.200]  nowhere else on earth.
[1:02:56.200 --> 1:03:04.440]  That is why America will always choose independence and cooperation over global governance, control
[1:03:04.440 --> 1:03:06.520]  and domination.
[1:03:06.520 --> 1:03:12.000]  I honor the right of every nation in this room to pursue its own customs, beliefs and
[1:03:12.000 --> 1:03:13.840]  traditions.
[1:03:13.840 --> 1:03:20.880]  The United States will not tell you how to live or work or worship.
[1:03:20.880 --> 1:03:25.520]  We only ask that you honor our sovereignty in return.
[1:03:25.520 --> 1:03:37.800]  Mirkel fights for globalism, warrants Trump against destroying the UN that the Rockefeller
[1:03:37.800 --> 1:03:38.800]  set up.
[1:03:38.800 --> 1:03:39.960]  Global governance, close quote, a form of coercion and domination that responsible nations
[1:03:39.960 --> 1:03:44.160]  must defend against, Trump said during a speech.
[1:03:44.160 --> 1:03:45.160]  That is matrix breaking.
[1:03:45.160 --> 1:03:47.240]  So let me tell you something right now.
[1:03:47.240 --> 1:03:52.640]  I'm very proud to be persecuted by these tolerance because I want to change the world.
[1:03:52.640 --> 1:03:57.960]  The German press is calling her a lame duck chancellor.
[1:03:57.960 --> 1:04:02.640]  Maybe in Germany are talking about the beginning of the end of the Merkel era.
[1:04:02.640 --> 1:04:07.200]  You've always got my back, she told MPs this week, hours before they stabbed her in it.
[1:04:07.200 --> 1:04:10.760]  Yeah, a lot of people have an instinct to roll over and be slaves and kiss ass and do
[1:04:10.760 --> 1:04:11.760]  all this.
[1:04:11.760 --> 1:04:12.760]  I don't.
[1:04:12.760 --> 1:04:17.400]  And the trailblazers have an instinct to stand up for what's right and it's been those
[1:04:17.400 --> 1:04:21.280]  people in history that have ignited everything that's allowed us to get to this point.
[1:04:21.280 --> 1:04:26.400]  So I stand on their shoulders and in a hat tip to them and in respect to them.
[1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:27.520]  Mr. Trump, what's left in your life?
[1:04:27.520 --> 1:04:28.520]  You're 33 years old.
[1:04:28.520 --> 1:04:29.520]  You're worth all this money.
[1:04:29.520 --> 1:04:32.040]  You say you didn't say that you want to be worth a billion dollars.
[1:04:32.040 --> 1:04:33.040]  No, I really not.
[1:04:33.040 --> 1:04:36.520]  I just want to keep busy and keep active and be interested in what I do.
[1:04:36.520 --> 1:04:39.080]  And that's all there is to life as far as I'm concerned.
[1:04:39.080 --> 1:04:42.280]  I really am not looking to make tremendous amounts of money.
[1:04:42.280 --> 1:04:43.600]  I'm looking to enjoy my life.
[1:04:43.600 --> 1:04:45.800]  And if that happens to go with it, that's fabulous.
[1:04:45.800 --> 1:04:50.000]  Whether they be black, white, old, young, where they came from, who they were.
[1:04:50.000 --> 1:04:53.760]  The fact that they believed in freedom, that they stood up, whether they're Martin Luther
[1:04:53.760 --> 1:04:58.520]  King or Donald John Trump or Kanye West.
[1:04:58.520 --> 1:05:00.520]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[1:05:00.520 --> 1:05:05.040]  What we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids
[1:05:05.040 --> 1:05:07.640]  get their EPA and DHA too.
[1:05:07.640 --> 1:05:13.160]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child, built from the ground up to
[1:05:13.160 --> 1:05:15.160]  support your child's development.

[1:05:21.760 --> 1:05:24.960]  with vitamins to boost your child's mind and body.
[1:05:24.960 --> 1:05:30.280]  With this fish oil formula, you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive
[1:05:30.280 --> 1:05:35.280]  and brain health while providing DHA, which has been shown to be essential for your child's
[1:05:35.280 --> 1:05:37.040]  brain growth spurts.

[1:06:01.160 --> 1:06:07.880]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of
[1:06:07.880 --> 1:06:14.880]  the Infowar.
[1:07:00.960 --> 1:07:07.200]  Faith Goldie's our guest, and she's born in Toronto, Canada, running for mayor up there,
[1:07:07.200 --> 1:07:11.320]  and a national TV and radio host, you name it, and a lot of folks know who she is.
[1:07:11.320 --> 1:07:18.240]  FaithFortoronto.ca, she's on Twitter, et Faith Goldie, and I think it's best for her to introduce
[1:07:18.240 --> 1:07:21.720]  for the audience what happened to her last week, and we appreciate her coming on the
[1:07:21.720 --> 1:07:26.120]  broadcast and why she then basically crashed the mayoral event.
[1:07:26.120 --> 1:07:31.640]  But I looked at the polls, there's six people running, she is in the middle of the pack,
[1:07:31.640 --> 1:07:36.600]  the others are against basic freedoms, I guess, that's why the systems force feeding her,
[1:07:36.600 --> 1:07:41.320]  but I'm seeing this internet censorship of libertarians and conservatives and everybody
[1:07:41.320 --> 1:07:49.320]  now really segue into newspapers, into mayoral events, into everything, where in Canada especially,
[1:07:49.320 --> 1:07:51.960]  they're trying to arrest people for their political speech now.
[1:07:51.960 --> 1:07:57.520]  So a real iron curtain descending across the world, but I love what Faith did, she ended
[1:07:57.520 --> 1:08:00.520]  up stealing the show in more ways than one.
[1:08:00.520 --> 1:08:02.640]  So Faith, thanks for joining us.
[1:08:02.640 --> 1:08:06.120]  Thanks for having me on, Alex, it's a real honor, and I appreciate you helping to spread
[1:08:06.120 --> 1:08:10.360]  our message of how much democracy is under siege.
[1:08:10.360 --> 1:08:14.120]  So I saw just last week, you played some of the clips of what's been happening here north
[1:08:14.120 --> 1:08:16.040]  of the 49th in Toronto.
[1:08:16.040 --> 1:08:20.960]  So I'm running for mayor, and Alex, I have to say, there are actually more than 30 candidates,
[1:08:20.960 --> 1:08:26.000]  and I have been polling in the top three since the day I announced my bid to become mayor.
[1:08:26.000 --> 1:08:32.480]  In fact, my polling numbers are higher than all 32 people underneath me combined.
[1:08:32.480 --> 1:08:39.320]  Looking at these folks, these opinion makers and gatekeepers, rather, of the status quo,
[1:08:39.320 --> 1:08:42.720]  are inviting everyone onto their stage, except for me.
[1:08:42.720 --> 1:08:43.720]  Why?
[1:08:43.720 --> 1:08:46.360]  Because my message tilts at windmills.
[1:08:46.360 --> 1:08:47.680]  It's no nonsense.
[1:08:47.680 --> 1:08:53.040]  It puts public safety above political correctness, and it questions the professional politicians
[1:08:53.040 --> 1:08:59.320]  and political elite that would sooner turn our city into an Agenda 21 playground for
[1:08:59.320 --> 1:09:04.040]  criminals, where we now have a higher murder rate than New York City's.
[1:09:04.040 --> 1:09:09.160]  So our very first debate was about all things, about the topic of the arts, okay?
[1:09:09.160 --> 1:09:13.240]  This is something that liberal fancy pants care about, but Joe Sixpack at home frankly
[1:09:13.240 --> 1:09:16.000]  doesn't give a damn about, because he can't afford his house.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:17.720]  He can't afford his taxes.
[1:09:17.720 --> 1:09:21.560]  He's worried that his kids are going to get shot up by stray bullets in the parking lot.
[1:09:21.560 --> 1:09:25.640]  He's worried that his dog is going to be stepping on, you know, these injection needles in the
[1:09:25.640 --> 1:09:26.880]  middle of the park.
[1:09:26.880 --> 1:09:30.760]  So they have to talk about, you know, the arts fancy pants stuff going on downtown.
[1:09:30.760 --> 1:09:33.320]  So I thought that this was a bit of an injustice.
[1:09:33.320 --> 1:09:38.640]  And so while I maybe wasn't invited, that wouldn't stop me, a tax-paying, freedom-loving citizen
[1:09:38.640 --> 1:09:42.080]  of this once great city, from getting up on top of that stage.
[1:09:42.080 --> 1:09:43.520]  And that's exactly what I did.
[1:09:43.520 --> 1:09:47.280]  As you can see there, I made a little quip about how I must have lost my invitation in
[1:09:47.280 --> 1:09:53.840]  the mail, and introduced myself as Faith Goldian automatically the liberal sheep in the audience
[1:09:53.840 --> 1:09:58.920]  began bawling at me and booing me, and really what I wanted to do was show that they weren't
[1:09:58.920 --> 1:10:04.640]  just censoring me, but indeed the 5,000 people's names who I had brought on that signatures
[1:10:04.640 --> 1:10:10.480]  on that petition that you see me handling to the little leper control who was hosting
[1:10:10.480 --> 1:10:11.480]  the debate.
[1:10:11.480 --> 1:10:14.160]  And then police quickly escorted me off.
[1:10:14.160 --> 1:10:18.520]  But as they did so, I reminded them that we are indeed the only campaign that's looking
[1:10:18.520 --> 1:10:23.680]  to work with our police and empower them to keep our streets safe again.
[1:10:23.680 --> 1:10:27.960]  Because in this era of political correctness, regrettably, we've said that everything that
[1:10:27.960 --> 1:10:29.480]  the cops do is racist.
[1:10:29.480 --> 1:10:34.440]  And so these guys have become handcuffed while our criminals are able to walk free in this
[1:10:34.440 --> 1:10:35.440]  city.
[1:10:35.440 --> 1:10:40.280]  And what this has now done, Alex, is this has created the first domino and now a tsunami
[1:10:40.280 --> 1:10:41.280]  of events.
[1:10:41.280 --> 1:10:46.360]  Shortly after I was dragged off stage by that police officer in the security guards, and
[1:10:46.360 --> 1:10:49.720]  by the way, I'm pretty sure that they're new voters now for the Faith Goldie campaign
[1:10:49.720 --> 1:10:52.600]  after hearing what we're about.
[1:10:52.600 --> 1:10:57.760]  Shortly after that, we had our paid for ads banned from TV.
[1:10:57.760 --> 1:11:01.480]  These were very milk toast, sensible ads.
[1:11:01.480 --> 1:11:05.920]  Then thereafter this morning, we were supposed to go to another debate, which we weren't
[1:11:05.920 --> 1:11:11.600]  invited to, but the whole debate has now been canceled because they're so afraid of us.
[1:11:11.600 --> 1:11:14.400]  And Alex, I'm going to break some news right here for you.
[1:11:14.400 --> 1:11:19.200]  Three of our top accounts that have been supporters of us, or even if not supporters, just free
[1:11:19.200 --> 1:11:24.560]  speech advocates who have helped shed some light on what we have now been enduring.
[1:11:24.560 --> 1:11:30.720]  This almost collusive bed fellowship between the mainstream media and the political elite.
[1:11:30.720 --> 1:11:36.840]  Three of our Twitter fans, I guess you could say, and free speech loving citizens in this
[1:11:36.840 --> 1:11:39.280]  city, they've now been suspended from Twitter.
[1:11:39.280 --> 1:11:44.800]  So there is an all out assault on our little campaign for mayor.
[1:11:44.800 --> 1:11:52.360]  Well, that's because if we get a smart, pro free market type, pro Trump, beautiful, smart
[1:11:52.360 --> 1:11:58.200]  woman in that sends shock waves across the world, everything they're doing is to try
[1:11:58.200 --> 1:12:01.840]  to stop something like you because you're everything they wish they had.
[1:12:01.840 --> 1:12:05.080]  And that's happening to all conservatives, all nationalists, all over the world.
[1:12:05.080 --> 1:12:10.280]  Twitter, Facebook, Google, as you know, are concertedly trying to stop populist nationalist
[1:12:10.280 --> 1:12:11.280]  movements everywhere.
[1:12:11.280 --> 1:12:16.520]  And I had just read the local paper, you know, saying that you were polling number three
[1:12:16.520 --> 1:12:18.000]  out of the six major candidates.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:21.360]  I had no idea that there were 30 plus total.
[1:12:21.360 --> 1:12:22.360]  That is amazing.
[1:12:22.360 --> 1:12:26.760]  Yeah, it's, it's quite insane, but look, we know what this is all about, Alex.
[1:12:26.760 --> 1:12:32.080]  You were very much the godfather of this new surge against freedom lovers.
[1:12:32.080 --> 1:12:35.640]  It happens when powerful people feel threatened.
[1:12:35.640 --> 1:12:40.880]  And now with a democratization of data with a boom of things like info wars and other
[1:12:40.880 --> 1:12:46.960]  alternative media, they have lost their strangleholds on the narrative.
[1:12:46.960 --> 1:12:52.480]  And people are starting to come to and say, hold on a second, we tried it your way, globalists.
[1:12:52.480 --> 1:12:55.080]  We tried it your way, Marxists.
[1:12:55.080 --> 1:12:58.320]  And the status quo just isn't working for us.
[1:12:58.320 --> 1:13:00.360]  We want our old freedoms back.
[1:13:00.360 --> 1:13:02.840]  We want for fair elections back.
[1:13:02.840 --> 1:13:06.960]  We want to be part of the democratic election process again.
[1:13:06.960 --> 1:13:08.960]  And well, the guys in power don't like it.
[1:13:08.960 --> 1:13:13.680]  And here's the crazy part is that it's essentially leading to a Streisand effect wherein they
[1:13:13.680 --> 1:13:18.640]  think that they're censoring me, but now I think we've got over 8,000 names on our little
[1:13:18.640 --> 1:13:19.640]  petition.
[1:13:19.640 --> 1:13:24.840]  They're not just censoring me, they're censoring thousands of people who are with this campaign
[1:13:24.840 --> 1:13:29.040]  and tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, perhaps who are watching this.
[1:13:29.040 --> 1:13:33.720]  I mean, that one little clip that we did of us just walking across stage has, I think,
[1:13:33.720 --> 1:13:37.000]  well over at least a quarter of a million views already.
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.000]  And so our movement is growing.
[1:13:39.000 --> 1:13:43.200]  The more that they try to silence us, the more people are starting to pay attention because
[1:13:43.200 --> 1:13:45.760]  they're saying, what is this forbidden fruit?
[1:13:45.760 --> 1:13:50.200]  Well, I'll tell you, it's not the forbidden fruit of evil and lies.
[1:13:50.200 --> 1:13:55.040]  The forbidden fruit in today's culture of death and lies is truth itself.
[1:13:55.040 --> 1:13:59.800]  And you were saying just before the break, Alex, that you wear as a badge of honor that
[1:13:59.800 --> 1:14:00.800]  we're being persecuted.
[1:14:00.800 --> 1:14:05.040]  Well, I'm a Christian woman and I'm devote and Jesus said, blessed are they that are
[1:14:05.040 --> 1:14:09.040]  persecuted for my name's sake, for there shall be the kingdom of heaven.
[1:14:09.040 --> 1:14:12.240]  And that's what we're all about here, baby, on the Faith Goldie campaign.
[1:14:12.240 --> 1:14:14.800]  We're about capital T truth.
[1:14:14.800 --> 1:14:16.960]  We're about justice.
[1:14:16.960 --> 1:14:22.240]  And we're about that for all people in this city who want in on this freedom train.
[1:14:22.240 --> 1:14:24.280]  And that's what makes us so dangerous.
[1:14:24.280 --> 1:14:28.760]  And you should be the winner out of nowhere, number three against 30 plus other candidates
[1:14:28.760 --> 1:14:30.720]  and they won't let you on the stage.
[1:14:30.720 --> 1:14:33.720]  How outrageously authoritarian is that?
[1:14:33.720 --> 1:14:38.480]  And it shows they were so arrogant before, but now with populism and Brexit and Trump
[1:14:38.480 --> 1:14:42.840]  and from Brazil to areas of Asia, nationals candidates are in the lead.
[1:14:42.840 --> 1:14:43.840]  So they're getting stabbed.
[1:14:43.840 --> 1:14:44.840]  They're getting shot.
[1:14:44.840 --> 1:14:45.840]  They're getting blown up.
[1:14:45.840 --> 1:14:47.560]  They're not just getting censored.
[1:14:47.560 --> 1:14:49.120]  This is all over the world.
[1:14:49.120 --> 1:14:54.600]  The left ally with the chai comms and with the EU and with big tech are taking the gloves
[1:14:54.600 --> 1:14:55.600]  off.
[1:14:55.600 --> 1:14:58.200]  Don't they know historically that blows up in their face?
[1:14:58.200 --> 1:14:59.200]  Massively.
[1:14:59.200 --> 1:15:02.680]  But look, here's the thing, Alex, is that these people have been preconditioned because
[1:15:02.680 --> 1:15:07.880]  we have removed things like free speech from the public space, free speech from our universities,
[1:15:07.880 --> 1:15:08.880]  etc.
[1:15:08.880 --> 1:15:11.400]  What happens when your mouth and your mind stop working?
[1:15:11.400 --> 1:15:15.000]  Because of course, without free speech, there's no such thing as critical reasoning.
[1:15:15.000 --> 1:15:16.200]  So you got no mouth.
[1:15:16.200 --> 1:15:17.200]  You got no voice.
[1:15:17.200 --> 1:15:18.200]  You got no brain.
[1:15:18.200 --> 1:15:19.560]  You've got no critical reasoning.
[1:15:19.560 --> 1:15:24.600]  All that's left are fists and as we saw with the presidential candidate in Brazil, knives
[1:15:24.600 --> 1:15:25.600]  are now coming out.
[1:15:25.600 --> 1:15:29.600]  I mean, people who meet me on the streets, who are part of these Marxists, you know, these
[1:15:29.600 --> 1:15:34.720]  sheepish hordes, they think that they're fighting a literal Nazi when really all I want to do
[1:15:34.720 --> 1:15:40.080]  is debate with them and they will soon realize that our arguments are better than theirs.
[1:15:40.080 --> 1:15:43.880]  But they are the dumbest of the dumb controlled by the most evil of the evil funded by Soros
[1:15:43.880 --> 1:15:48.320]  and others, so they have been whipped up into this like larping, like it's a video game
[1:15:48.320 --> 1:15:52.520]  and you're just a bot that they're there to kill when you're a real person and not what
[1:15:52.520 --> 1:15:57.560]  they said, but they dehumanize you, faith gold and stay there, we'll be right back.
[1:15:57.560 --> 1:16:01.600]  Healthcare reform is confusing, but whether it's finding an affordable insurance plan,

[1:16:58.480 --> 1:17:04.000]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.

[1:18:08.760 --> 1:18:13.280]  It's very hard for me to get into the good halogen, but instead they hammer you with
[1:18:13.280 --> 1:18:19.160]  the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromine, that literally fog you, fill all your cells,
[1:18:19.160 --> 1:18:20.880]  your thyroid, you name it.
[1:18:20.880 --> 1:18:23.800]  Myotrysilinium goes with it like a horse of carriage.
[1:18:23.800 --> 1:18:26.200]  Silinium is an electrochemical.
[1:18:26.200 --> 1:18:33.000]  It's needed as well in all activity in the body, particularly neurons, so these go incredibly
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:34.000]  well together.
[1:18:34.000 --> 1:18:35.000]  We have a combo of those.
[1:18:35.000 --> 1:18:36.600]  Just experience it for yourself.
[1:18:36.600 --> 1:18:39.400]  Why do you think they fear me so much?
[1:18:39.400 --> 1:18:40.400]  Very simple stuff.
[1:18:40.400 --> 1:18:41.400]  Filter your water.
[1:18:41.400 --> 1:18:44.200]  Yeah, I find myself still on a water filter.
[1:18:44.200 --> 1:18:45.200]  Best out there for the price.
[1:18:45.200 --> 1:18:49.360]  When I say it's the last run, I think it'll be six months a year until we get more.
[1:18:49.360 --> 1:18:50.360]  I hope we get more.
[1:18:50.360 --> 1:18:51.360]  This is the last run.

[1:20:21.680 --> 1:20:49.120]  Raging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[1:20:49.120 --> 1:20:52.880]  I'm sitting here listening and looking at Faith Goldie and just admiring everything
[1:20:52.880 --> 1:20:57.440]  she does and her eloquence makes me feel good to know there's other smart people out there
[1:20:57.440 --> 1:20:58.440]  taking action.
[1:20:58.440 --> 1:21:06.680]  But at the same time, I catch myself getting angry because this is real authoritarianism,
[1:21:06.680 --> 1:21:13.000]  this is real oppression, this is real censorship, and it's by the left in universities all over
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:17.520]  the world and right here in my own nation and now spreading out to the city councils
[1:21:17.520 --> 1:21:28.680]  and the legislatures and the capitals where if you even criticize radical Islam or anything
[1:21:28.680 --> 1:21:35.240]  else, the system censors you and then jails you and it just goes on from there.
[1:21:35.240 --> 1:21:40.920]  And then I was reading earlier, we'll get to some of it later, about the city festivals
[1:21:40.920 --> 1:21:45.640]  they're having in San Francisco that children are taken to where people defecate each other's
[1:21:45.640 --> 1:21:50.440]  mouths and cut each other and bleed all over the streets and how beautiful it is and how
[1:21:50.440 --> 1:21:54.920]  they're teaching us about consent because they're the moral good people that crap in
[1:21:54.920 --> 1:21:55.920]  each other's mouths.
[1:21:55.920 --> 1:21:59.920]  Now, I'm sorry to be talking to the audience like that and having a nice young beautiful
[1:21:59.920 --> 1:22:04.160]  woman here talking like that in front of her, but that's what's in the San Francisco Chronicle
[1:22:04.160 --> 1:22:05.160]  today.
[1:22:05.160 --> 1:22:09.640]  In fact, it's somewhere in my stack, I'll never find it, please print it for me again.
[1:22:09.640 --> 1:22:14.800]  And that's their moral leadership, this culture of we're going to kill your babies, but Brett
[1:22:14.800 --> 1:22:18.880]  Kavanaugh is a rapist because we say so with no proof.
[1:22:18.880 --> 1:22:24.200]  And then oh, and this lady's smart and successful TV and radio host and with no funding or no
[1:22:24.200 --> 1:22:26.960]  establishment behind her, she's number three in all the polls.
[1:22:26.960 --> 1:22:28.360]  My God, she'll win.
[1:22:28.360 --> 1:22:30.560]  My God, they'll take back power from us.
[1:22:30.560 --> 1:22:36.000]  My God, we don't want a good Christian, hardworking, smart woman as mayor who will actually turn
[1:22:36.000 --> 1:22:37.680]  the crime-ridden city around.
[1:22:37.680 --> 1:22:43.480]  No, we want the hellish places like Toronto and San Francisco and Detroit.
[1:22:43.480 --> 1:22:49.000]  What is it, Faith Gold, and we'll play the video in a moment with audio of you basically
[1:22:49.000 --> 1:22:50.920]  grabbing victory from the jaws of defeat?
[1:22:50.920 --> 1:22:54.080]  What is it about the left that they destroy everything they touch?
[1:22:54.080 --> 1:22:58.160]  Because every blue city in the world and every blue country, socialist country, if you call
[1:22:58.160 --> 1:23:01.280]  it blue, used to be called red, is a hellhole.
[1:23:01.280 --> 1:23:06.080]  They take beautiful good places and when in a decade create abject nightmares.
[1:23:06.080 --> 1:23:07.760]  What is it about these people?
[1:23:07.760 --> 1:23:12.480]  Well, I think right at its core is the fact that they are motivated, frankly, by the forces
[1:23:12.480 --> 1:23:13.480]  of evil.
[1:23:13.480 --> 1:23:18.960]  But quite outside of that, in order to move forward with their socialist, that's really
[1:23:18.960 --> 1:23:24.000]  what it is at the end of the day, agenda, they have to create crises so that whenever
[1:23:24.000 --> 1:23:29.240]  expansive government can offer the solutions.
[1:23:29.240 --> 1:23:35.320]  So what that has led to is a complete attack on the things that have made the West a healthy
[1:23:35.320 --> 1:23:43.000]  body that includes our moral civic consensus, our family structure, simple things that have
[1:23:43.000 --> 1:23:45.400]  helped to keep the West great.
[1:23:45.400 --> 1:23:50.080]  And what they do is they attack these things in ways that they can, which have been largely
[1:23:50.080 --> 1:23:57.080]  through the long march of the institutions, our schools, our media and our political establishment.
[1:23:57.080 --> 1:24:01.760]  So to manufacture this crisis, and then when we see that, well, mom and dad aren't together
[1:24:01.760 --> 1:24:05.960]  anymore, my house is in shambles, we don't know what's right and wrong anymore.
[1:24:05.960 --> 1:24:09.640]  We've got big billboards of rap stars with their, you know, what's it's hanging out right
[1:24:09.640 --> 1:24:14.320]  over top of schools where they're teaching these kids all sorts of perverse ideas before
[1:24:14.320 --> 1:24:16.720]  they can barely even spell library.
[1:24:16.720 --> 1:24:22.400]  Well, then come on, mom and daddy state, help create a solution for us.
[1:24:22.400 --> 1:24:26.920]  So what they do is they run completely counter to all the things that have made the West
[1:24:26.920 --> 1:24:33.360]  great, which are really a foundation on frankly, Christian tenants, things like personal responsibility,
[1:24:33.360 --> 1:24:37.920]  equality of opportunity and freedom.
[1:24:37.920 --> 1:24:40.520]  And so I think that's why we see such a pushback.
[1:24:40.520 --> 1:24:47.720]  And I will say that the reason why they have become so much more militant about just engaging
[1:24:47.720 --> 1:24:52.880]  their agenda and achieving it is because the stakes couldn't be higher.
[1:24:52.880 --> 1:24:58.360]  Right now, for instance, in my jurisdiction, Toronto has become a sanctuary city to our
[1:24:58.360 --> 1:25:05.680]  self-professed feminist prime minister's crazy open borders policy and undemocratic open borders
[1:25:05.680 --> 1:25:06.680]  policy.
[1:25:06.680 --> 1:25:11.840]  And they're shipping in these people by the thousands into Toronto shelters while our
[1:25:11.840 --> 1:25:15.800]  guys who, you know, have been taxpayers who might have an addiction, might have a mental
[1:25:15.800 --> 1:25:18.960]  health issue are left to struggle on the streets.
[1:25:18.960 --> 1:25:26.200]  So, you know, my Toronto first mentality and very bold, you know, policy of just putting
[1:25:26.200 --> 1:25:30.200]  Toronto first, all of our taxpayers, which include our little homeless guys as well,
[1:25:30.200 --> 1:25:36.600]  who need our help, it threatens their biggest industry right now, which is illegal migration
[1:25:36.600 --> 1:25:40.240]  into our country.
[1:25:40.240 --> 1:25:42.120]  Gut level.
[1:25:42.120 --> 1:25:45.600]  What would you call this point in history of reached and where do you think we're going?
[1:25:45.600 --> 1:25:48.800]  I mean, I don't care what they do or what they say or what they do to me.
[1:25:48.800 --> 1:25:50.160]  I'm not going to stop.
[1:25:50.160 --> 1:25:55.640]  And the media spun this falsely saying that Alex Jones is ready to die.
[1:25:55.640 --> 1:26:00.280]  Alex Jones says he's close to God cryptic statements in an interview I did.
[1:26:00.280 --> 1:26:02.800]  And the individual was saying, how far will you fight?
[1:26:02.800 --> 1:26:03.800]  We've ever backed down.
[1:26:03.800 --> 1:26:05.920]  And I was saying, give me liberty or give me death.
[1:26:05.920 --> 1:26:08.920]  Patrick Henry didn't mean Patrick Henry was going to commit suicide.
[1:26:08.920 --> 1:26:09.920]  I would never commit suicide.
[1:26:09.920 --> 1:26:14.600]  What I was saying is the more I get persecuted, the more I'm doing right, the closer I get
[1:26:14.600 --> 1:26:20.800]  to God, it makes me feel good at a spiritual level to be awake and to not be a zombie.
[1:26:20.800 --> 1:26:25.880]  Like so many people are, as my consciousness and my awakening intensifies, it's a good
[1:26:25.880 --> 1:26:26.880]  thing.
[1:26:26.880 --> 1:26:31.520]  And then I'm ready to go all the way, just like Christians would not renounce Christ
[1:26:31.520 --> 1:26:34.720]  in Rome and got thrown to the lions.
[1:26:34.720 --> 1:26:37.320]  I'm saying I'm not going to renounce my faith.
[1:26:37.320 --> 1:26:40.800]  That doesn't mean I'm a Bible thumper either in an everybody's face saying I'm a perfect
[1:26:40.800 --> 1:26:41.800]  person.
[1:26:41.800 --> 1:26:42.800]  It means I love God.
[1:26:42.800 --> 1:26:43.800]  I love justice.
[1:26:43.800 --> 1:26:44.800]  I love the most of Christ.
[1:26:44.800 --> 1:26:46.560]  I want to stand up for unborn children.
[1:26:46.560 --> 1:26:48.280]  I want to promote the right to self-defense.
[1:26:48.280 --> 1:26:50.400]  I know capitalism is the best system.
[1:26:50.400 --> 1:26:53.000]  I don't want our children being sexualized.
[1:26:53.000 --> 1:26:54.000]  It's simple.
[1:26:54.000 --> 1:26:57.280]  And these globalists and all these freaks want control of our lives.
[1:26:57.280 --> 1:26:58.360]  It's their world.
[1:26:58.360 --> 1:26:59.360]  It's their universe.
[1:26:59.360 --> 1:27:01.320]  And they twist and lie.
[1:27:01.320 --> 1:27:03.080]  Everything I say, everything I do.
[1:27:03.080 --> 1:27:07.280]  When I say I'm willing to die for this, it means just what I said.
[1:27:07.280 --> 1:27:09.600]  I don't want to die, but I'm willing to die.
[1:27:09.600 --> 1:27:11.000]  I'm never going to back down.
[1:27:11.000 --> 1:27:12.800]  I'm never going to give in.
[1:27:12.800 --> 1:27:19.080]  I'm never going to submit to these weird globalists and all of the satanic crap they're
[1:27:19.080 --> 1:27:20.080]  into.
[1:27:20.080 --> 1:27:23.200]  Yeah, you know, you asked me what would you call this juncture of our history.
[1:27:23.200 --> 1:27:26.520]  I recall that Spengler talked about the seasons of civilization.
[1:27:26.520 --> 1:27:29.480]  And I do think that we're really in the fall right now.
[1:27:29.480 --> 1:27:32.720]  There seems to be this chill that is coming.
[1:27:32.720 --> 1:27:37.840]  But we, of course, are going to be the last blossoms that give the onlookers some sort
[1:27:37.840 --> 1:27:41.000]  of hope of what once was and what could be.
[1:27:41.000 --> 1:27:42.760]  And I'm right there with you, Alex.
[1:27:42.760 --> 1:27:49.120]  You know, as a woman of largely Greek heritage, Molon Lave is imprinted in my heart and soul.
[1:27:49.120 --> 1:27:54.160]  I've got a fire burning in my belly and I'm going to pursue truth and follow the facts
[1:27:54.160 --> 1:27:55.400]  wherever they lead.
[1:27:55.400 --> 1:27:59.360]  I don't care if it makes people uncomfortable because by gosh, we're going to be a lot more
[1:27:59.360 --> 1:28:06.440]  uncomfortable in this snowball of lies as opposed to one that's led by the torch of truth.
[1:28:06.440 --> 1:28:11.120]  And Alex, can I give you some free advertising right now?
[1:28:11.120 --> 1:28:15.560]  So Alex, you know how you said that you think that we're spirited and bright people that
[1:28:15.560 --> 1:28:16.560]  are part of our campaign?
[1:28:16.560 --> 1:28:21.280]  I'll say that the entire phallus and upper echelon of our campaign is heavily on brain
[1:28:21.280 --> 1:28:25.800]  force and a lot of our guys are on a healthy male vitality as well.
[1:28:25.800 --> 1:28:27.880]  So there's some free advertising for you guys.
[1:28:27.880 --> 1:28:30.080]  Well, I tell you, I've seen you're working.
[1:28:30.080 --> 1:28:31.080]  It's amazing.
[1:28:31.080 --> 1:28:32.080]  And I am sold.
[1:28:32.080 --> 1:28:35.400]  I want you to be the mayor of Toronto because I've been there before and then I came back
[1:28:35.400 --> 1:28:39.200]  a few years ago and it has really gotten crappy and looks like San Francisco.
[1:28:39.200 --> 1:28:40.640]  We're going to open the phones up.
[1:28:40.640 --> 1:28:44.480]  We want to talk to Faith Goldie, who's going to win in Toronto unless there's election
[1:28:44.480 --> 1:28:45.480]  fraud.
[1:28:45.480 --> 1:28:47.960]  And I think them keeping her off the stage, even though she's number three out of a field
[1:28:47.960 --> 1:28:50.160]  of 30 plus, has already brought up their face.
[1:28:50.160 --> 1:28:54.840]  But what can we do down here in the U.S. and unless there's a candidate to make sure these
[1:28:54.840 --> 1:28:57.920]  censors aren't able to stop this amazing lady?
[1:28:57.920 --> 1:28:58.920]  Hear that?
[1:28:58.920 --> 1:29:04.360]  That's the sound of a house being trashed while a gang of thieves ransacked the place.
[1:29:04.360 --> 1:29:07.320]  And what they don't steal will be destroyed.
[1:29:07.320 --> 1:29:12.800]  This year, resolve not to be the next victim of a break-in, go to faketv.com and discover

[1:29:17.720 --> 1:29:18.720]  away.

[1:31:02.760 --> 1:31:06.320]  InfoWars is proud to sell incredible filters, but it's almost impossible to keep up with
[1:31:06.320 --> 1:31:09.320]  every faucet, shower and sink in your home.

[1:31:54.160 --> 1:31:58.040]  Pro Pure Whole House filtration system today.
[1:31:58.040 --> 1:32:02.400]  We've taken thousands of years of known research and put it together with our own four years
[1:32:02.400 --> 1:32:07.120]  of seeking and testing to find the very best systems that God gave us through Mother Nature
[1:32:07.120 --> 1:32:08.640]  to detoxify the body.
[1:32:08.640 --> 1:32:13.520]  That's why I'm introducing Z Shield, Toxic Metal and Chemical Defense Support.
[1:32:13.520 --> 1:32:15.040]  It's made in the USA.
[1:32:15.040 --> 1:32:19.960]  It's filled with known compounds from nature that are absolutely associated with detoxifying
[1:32:19.960 --> 1:32:21.800]  the body and it supports the InfoWars.
[1:32:21.800 --> 1:32:24.060]  It is a classical 360 win.
[1:32:24.060 --> 1:32:28.520]  This is the formula that I personally have been taking for over a year and now we believe
[1:32:28.520 --> 1:32:33.200]  we have come as close to perfection when it comes to a detoxifier as you can possibly
[1:32:33.200 --> 1:32:34.200]  get.
[1:32:34.200 --> 1:32:37.440]  You owe it to yourself, you owe it to your family, and you owe it to the future of this
[1:32:37.440 --> 1:32:42.440]  country and the world that patriots stay as healthy and as clean and as focused as you
[1:32:42.440 --> 1:32:47.680]  can be because we need you, the remnant of America, to reignite those brush fires the
[1:32:47.680 --> 1:32:51.520]  next level and to be healthy and as focused as you can be thanks to your support and your
[1:32:51.520 --> 1:32:52.520]  prayers together.
[1:32:52.520 --> 1:32:53.520]  We're changing the world.
[1:32:53.520 --> 1:33:00.960]  Now it's time to change our bodies with Z Shield and InfoWarsLive.com.
[1:33:00.960 --> 1:33:19.960]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:33:19.960 --> 1:33:32.720]  So Faith Goldie is really in third place out of 30 plus people.
[1:33:32.720 --> 1:33:35.160]  That's amazing and they won't let her come to the debates.
[1:33:35.160 --> 1:33:40.720]  So she's engaged in real information guerrilla warfare and we're so excited about that.
[1:33:40.720 --> 1:33:43.480]  And we've already rolled the video for TV viewers, for radio listeners, let me play
[1:33:43.480 --> 1:33:44.480]  it with audio.
[1:33:44.480 --> 1:33:49.520]  This is her last week at the city sponsored mayoral candidate event and here are all these
[1:33:49.520 --> 1:33:55.160]  other people up there who are behind her in the polls but she's not there, here it is.
[1:33:55.160 --> 1:34:00.600]  And this morning, ArtsVote held the first public debate for mayor of Toronto.
[1:34:00.600 --> 1:34:04.400]  Faith Goldie is currently in third highest polling candidate for Toronto mayor.
[1:34:04.400 --> 1:34:07.800]  So why was she not invited to the debate?
[1:34:07.800 --> 1:34:11.040]  Good morning, sorry I must have missed my invitation to mail.
[1:34:11.040 --> 1:34:38.840]  And she delivers 5,000 signatures of people that won her to the debate, here come the
[1:34:38.840 --> 1:34:50.520]  police to drag her out.
[1:34:50.520 --> 1:34:54.040]  They had an event called the rhetoric of Donald Trump and Alex Jones this weekend, taxpayer
[1:34:54.040 --> 1:34:56.800]  paid for, shut down downtown on a big stage.
[1:34:56.800 --> 1:35:02.000]  I went there and they were just shocked that I actually showed up and they were smiling
[1:35:02.000 --> 1:35:07.920]  and smirking and it was so enjoyable, they were openly discussing at the event how to
[1:35:07.920 --> 1:35:09.480]  shut conservatives off the internet.
[1:35:09.480 --> 1:35:14.200]  So that's the leftist answer, all the world is that their fact checkers including Charlie
[1:35:14.200 --> 1:35:19.600]  Weasel of Buzzfeed totally discredited, he sits there and waves a magic wand and contacts
[1:35:19.600 --> 1:35:23.400]  media, contacts tech giants to have media removed.
[1:35:23.400 --> 1:35:28.320]  So he believes he is God Faith Goldie and they smile, they're so proud to be the modern
[1:35:28.320 --> 1:35:29.320]  authoritarians.
[1:35:29.320 --> 1:35:33.840]  Well that's the thing and when you dig just beneath the surface of any of our enemies,
[1:35:33.840 --> 1:35:38.780]  the ones who are leading the charge, you realize that a lot of them are thick, twisted and
[1:35:38.780 --> 1:35:39.780]  evil people.
[1:35:39.780 --> 1:35:44.720]  Look no further than one of the co-founders of the SPLC who is quick to label everyone
[1:35:44.720 --> 1:35:45.720]  a racist and a Nazi.
[1:35:45.720 --> 1:35:51.200]  I'm pretty sure that he was doing sexually lewd things to his stepdaughter.
[1:35:51.200 --> 1:35:56.200]  You come here to Toronto and there's people who are leading the charge against me, who
[1:35:56.200 --> 1:36:01.520]  are in bed with the most radical elements of the jihadist movement here in Toronto.
[1:36:01.520 --> 1:36:08.760]  Our own mayor who will be outgoing come October 22nd, he's campaigning at mosques that have
[1:36:08.760 --> 1:36:14.440]  called for unbelievers to be slayed one by one and for the quote, filth of the Jew to
[1:36:14.440 --> 1:36:17.560]  be eliminated from their presence.
[1:36:17.560 --> 1:36:21.360]  By the way, one of these mosques is where the Danforth shooter in Toronto's Greek town
[1:36:21.360 --> 1:36:23.320]  where his family attends.
[1:36:23.320 --> 1:36:29.200]  So these people are the sorts of evils that they try to accuse us of being, but this is
[1:36:29.200 --> 1:36:35.080]  the sort of world of subversion and censorship that we now live in where what is truth is
[1:36:35.080 --> 1:36:41.680]  made to look like a lie, what is right is made to look like it's wrong and racist.
[1:36:41.680 --> 1:36:48.040]  And what we have to do is just to continue to frankly seek truth and also don't be afraid
[1:36:48.040 --> 1:36:50.640]  to sometimes let out what you think.
[1:36:50.640 --> 1:36:54.840]  Every single person I've talked to on this campaign, Alex says, I'm voting for you and
[1:36:54.840 --> 1:36:57.080]  everyone I talked to is voting for you.
[1:36:57.080 --> 1:37:01.320]  Don't be afraid to show it from the rooftops.
[1:37:01.320 --> 1:37:04.960]  One of the things that I hear from all of my volunteers is faith.
[1:37:04.960 --> 1:37:07.800]  Your fearlessness is contagious.
[1:37:07.800 --> 1:37:12.520]  Folks have to remember that we can all be leaders in our own lives, whether it be around the
[1:37:12.520 --> 1:37:19.880]  water cooler, our dinner tables and our university classrooms, having a brass pair is contagious.
[1:37:19.880 --> 1:37:20.880]  And people love that.
[1:37:20.880 --> 1:37:25.160]  And we have to remember also that our enemies, the guys at the top are evil, but the majority
[1:37:25.160 --> 1:37:28.160]  of the flock are honestly soy boys.
[1:37:28.160 --> 1:37:34.880]  When I see my guys lined up beside, say, my, the incumbents, guys along the same strip
[1:37:34.880 --> 1:37:37.760]  of sidewalk, they're just so low energy.
[1:37:37.760 --> 1:37:40.440]  Our enemies, they just look so lame.
[1:37:40.440 --> 1:37:41.440]  They're losers.
[1:37:41.440 --> 1:37:43.080]  They don't even know why they're there.
[1:37:43.080 --> 1:37:44.800]  They're human automatons.
[1:37:44.800 --> 1:37:47.600]  Just so in flip to switch and they started marching.
[1:37:47.600 --> 1:37:49.920]  Whereas our guys, they're fighting for truth.
[1:37:49.920 --> 1:37:51.400]  They're fighting for justice.
[1:37:51.400 --> 1:37:56.440]  And there's nothing that animates the human soul, especially in a time of darkness, like
[1:37:56.440 --> 1:38:00.520]  knowing that you are part of the light and you are part of the change that this world
[1:38:00.520 --> 1:38:02.040]  so desperately needs.
[1:38:02.040 --> 1:38:05.840]  So I'd encourage all of your audience, first of all, if you're in Toronto, come out to
[1:38:05.840 --> 1:38:10.280]  the ballot box, help spread our word because God knows the mainstream media is not letting
[1:38:10.280 --> 1:38:12.080]  us get a word in edge wise.
[1:38:12.080 --> 1:38:15.720]  And for everyone else, let our campaign inspire you.
[1:38:15.720 --> 1:38:20.960]  I see life as a series of doors and most of them are able to be opened.
[1:38:20.960 --> 1:38:22.400]  It's just a matter of timing.
[1:38:22.400 --> 1:38:27.080]  So find the time in your life to help, you know, so-called red pill your friends about
[1:38:27.080 --> 1:38:28.080]  what's happened.
[1:38:28.080 --> 1:38:29.080]  I'm totally sold.
[1:38:29.080 --> 1:38:33.000]  I was very familiar with your great work, but you are so eloquent, teleprompter free,
[1:38:33.000 --> 1:38:34.000]  so on target.
[1:38:34.000 --> 1:38:36.040]  Toronto needs a mayor like you.
[1:38:36.040 --> 1:38:37.680]  They need a prime minister like you.
[1:38:37.680 --> 1:38:41.960]  And that's again, smart, good looking, great background up against them.
[1:38:41.960 --> 1:38:45.560]  That's why they won't let you on the stage because you're too effective.
[1:38:45.560 --> 1:38:46.560]  You're too on target.
[1:38:46.560 --> 1:38:49.000]  And you know, you were talking during the break about you guys are going to pull fluoride
[1:38:49.000 --> 1:38:52.640]  out, if you get in, Harvard studies, a medic causes cancer.
[1:38:52.640 --> 1:38:55.880]  I mean, they are, they are so horrified of you.
[1:38:55.880 --> 1:38:59.880]  In closing, you were also, don't give us any inside baseball, but you were saying you guys
[1:38:59.880 --> 1:39:04.160]  have got a lot of third dimensional information warfare ready for them.
[1:39:04.160 --> 1:39:07.000]  Alex, we're onto 4D chess over here.
[1:39:07.000 --> 1:39:10.660]  Our opponents do not have plays for the sort of war games.
[1:39:10.660 --> 1:39:15.720]  We are going to be unleashing on them every day until October 22nd, E-Day.
[1:39:15.720 --> 1:39:17.080]  So it's energizing you.
[1:39:17.080 --> 1:39:18.920]  They're trying to suppress you.
[1:39:18.920 --> 1:39:21.800]  It's not making you submit.
[1:39:21.800 --> 1:39:22.800]  It's not demoralizing you.
[1:39:22.800 --> 1:39:24.320]  And that's what they don't get.
[1:39:24.320 --> 1:39:25.840]  It's that we came to change the world.
[1:39:25.840 --> 1:39:29.440]  We're not coming to try to be their minions or get a slot in their system.
[1:39:29.440 --> 1:39:33.120]  We're coming to try to fundamentally change the world.
[1:39:33.120 --> 1:39:34.120]  That's exactly right.
[1:39:34.120 --> 1:39:41.400]  They don't understand that we just get bigger numbers and more energized in our mission
[1:39:41.400 --> 1:39:43.280]  every single time they try to shut us down.
[1:39:43.280 --> 1:39:48.640]  Because what we know that signals is that we're more powerful and more on track than
[1:39:48.640 --> 1:39:51.040]  even perhaps we had any inclination of.
[1:39:51.040 --> 1:39:52.680]  So it's all fantastic.
[1:39:52.680 --> 1:39:56.360]  And you know, there's this, there's this, I think it's a Japanese warfare, a keto.
[1:39:56.360 --> 1:40:01.760]  You take the negative energy that your opponent gives to you and you use it back to destroy
[1:40:01.760 --> 1:40:02.760]  them.
[1:40:02.760 --> 1:40:03.760]  And that's exactly what we intend to do.
[1:40:03.760 --> 1:40:04.760]  Oh my gosh.
[1:40:04.760 --> 1:40:06.480]  I am so sold.
[1:40:06.480 --> 1:40:10.920]  Faith4toronto.ca, Faith Goldie, we're going to, you said you'll come back next week for
[1:40:10.920 --> 1:40:11.920]  45 minutes.
[1:40:11.920 --> 1:40:12.920]  Absolutely.
[1:40:12.920 --> 1:40:13.920]  We'll talk to you soon.
[1:40:13.920 --> 1:40:14.920]  Thank you so much.
[1:40:14.920 --> 1:40:15.920]  God bless you, Alex.
[1:40:15.920 --> 1:40:16.920]  Thank you, my friend.
[1:40:16.920 --> 1:40:17.920]  Oh, thank you.
[1:40:17.920 --> 1:40:20.000]  It's so exciting that she's got energy.
[1:40:20.000 --> 1:40:22.480]  She's got all of that will.
[1:40:22.480 --> 1:40:23.480]  She's smart.
[1:40:23.480 --> 1:40:24.480]  She's good-looking.
[1:40:24.480 --> 1:40:30.480]  And they are so scared of those long legs and that brain all together in one package.
[1:40:30.480 --> 1:40:32.560]  Because they claim they want powerful women.
[1:40:32.560 --> 1:40:35.080]  They do not want powerful women, okay?
[1:40:35.080 --> 1:40:39.440]  They want to control and make women victims, not victorious like Faith Goldie.
[1:40:39.440 --> 1:40:40.440]  So I'm completely sold.
[1:40:40.440 --> 1:40:42.120]  I've been following her for a couple of years.
[1:40:42.120 --> 1:40:46.040]  And the fact they're trying to suppress so many people is really making many women like
[1:40:46.040 --> 1:40:50.400]  her rise up of a race, color, and creed, and it is a beautiful, beautiful thing.
[1:40:50.400 --> 1:40:53.720]  So they can't have her on the stage because, well, they can't deal with it.
[1:40:53.720 --> 1:40:54.720]  Okay.
[1:40:54.720 --> 1:40:55.720]  Two things.
[1:40:55.720 --> 1:40:56.960]  Two things.
[1:40:56.960 --> 1:41:00.520]  We're ending Brain Force Plus 40% off on Wednesday.
[1:41:00.520 --> 1:41:03.480]  We're ending Secret 12, amazing high quality vitamin B12.
[1:41:03.480 --> 1:41:07.200]  You take under the tongue on Wednesday as well because both those are getting low.
[1:41:07.200 --> 1:41:10.000]  It's going to be December until we get more in.
[1:41:10.000 --> 1:41:13.320]  So those will go back to full price on Wednesday.
[1:41:13.320 --> 1:41:18.400]  We have ended the X2 at the discounted price, and this is the last run of Survival Shield
[1:41:18.400 --> 1:41:19.400]  X2.
[1:41:19.400 --> 1:41:24.760]  I mean, I had a hardcore hour-long meeting and told them the X2 deal was over, but of
[1:41:24.760 --> 1:41:25.760]  course it's still up there.
[1:41:25.760 --> 1:41:26.760]  Hey, whatever.
[1:41:26.760 --> 1:41:27.760]  I love it.
[1:41:27.760 --> 1:41:28.760]  Great.
[1:41:28.760 --> 1:41:29.760]  It'll be sold out even faster.
[1:41:29.760 --> 1:41:30.760]  So there you go.
[1:41:30.760 --> 1:41:38.480]  Getting back to what I was saying here, we have the new product, Happys, that is out.
[1:41:38.480 --> 1:41:44.280]  Happys is a mood and stress system, and I need to take some myself today.
[1:41:44.280 --> 1:41:51.800]  Let me tell you, but it takes known concentrated herbs that have been proven for thousands
[1:41:51.800 --> 1:41:59.600]  of years to give people clearer mind, healthier mind, more smooth, and with all of the agitation
[1:41:59.600 --> 1:42:03.040]  out there, this is something, especially when you get home in the afternoon and you want
[1:42:03.040 --> 1:42:04.600]  to kind of wind down.
[1:42:04.600 --> 1:42:13.000]  It's not a sedative, it's not a suppressant, but it's just known herbs, ashwagandha root,
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:18.760]  passion fruit, flower concentrate, green tea leaf, licorice root, and so much more to
[1:42:18.760 --> 1:42:23.480]  just smooth out the mind, and it's a very, very strong formula.
[1:42:23.480 --> 1:42:28.640]  It takes well-known formulas that are bestsellers and just makes it super organic, super concentrated,
[1:42:28.640 --> 1:42:29.640]  and super strong.
[1:42:29.640 --> 1:42:33.120]  And there's a bunch of other herbs in there as well, so check it out.
[1:42:33.120 --> 1:42:39.760]  Happys, mood and stress at infowarstore.com or infowarslife.com, you're right on the
[1:42:39.760 --> 1:42:47.120]  supplement page, or triple eight, two, five, three, three, one, three, nine.
[1:42:47.120 --> 1:42:57.400]  We'll be right back on the other side of this quick break, please stay with us.
[1:42:57.400 --> 1:43:02.400]  X2, we were selling it for about three years, and then they found out how big it was, and
[1:43:02.400 --> 1:43:05.880]  how much we were buying, and they said, oh, we want more money, more money, and oh, this
[1:43:05.880 --> 1:43:06.880]  and that.
[1:43:06.880 --> 1:43:12.240]  And so I've broken my contract, and right now we can't get more of this proprietary ingredient
[1:43:12.240 --> 1:43:13.240]  that goes in X2.
[1:43:13.240 --> 1:43:17.400]  It literally is so pure that if you put it in a picker dish on top of a 90 degree hot
[1:43:17.400 --> 1:43:21.320]  plate, it gasses, like I dream of genie, and it's purple gas.
[1:43:21.320 --> 1:43:24.880]  I mean, that is so pure, it just goes right into your body when you take it.
[1:43:24.880 --> 1:43:30.440]  We're working on trying to get other suppliers right now, but I bought a huge amount of it,
[1:43:30.440 --> 1:43:34.560]  ordered it six months ago, so I get the price down, and I said, if you don't lower it, I'm
[1:43:34.560 --> 1:43:35.560]  done, I'm breaking the contract.
[1:43:35.560 --> 1:43:40.280]  Well, I broke the contract last week, and so this is potentially the last run.
[1:43:40.280 --> 1:43:45.400]  In fact, right now it is the last run, there's a viable shield X2, and we've got a good supply
[1:43:45.400 --> 1:43:47.320]  of it, but it'll be gone in a couple of months.
[1:43:47.320 --> 1:43:52.680]  X2, if you haven't experienced it, M4store.com, if you have experienced it, I suggest you
[1:43:52.680 --> 1:43:53.680]  stop up on it.
[1:43:53.680 --> 1:43:57.320]  It's available right now for a limited time, M4store.com, right now.
[1:43:57.320 --> 1:44:02.520]  Experts could not describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[1:44:02.520 --> 1:44:06.920]  M4Lords is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt
[1:44:06.920 --> 1:44:10.320]  justice department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[1:44:10.320 --> 1:44:13.080]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[1:44:13.080 --> 1:44:17.120]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground, and I knew we had
[1:44:17.120 --> 1:44:21.400]  no future if we didn't do this, so we've already had incredible success.
[1:44:21.400 --> 1:44:26.280]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and
[1:44:26.280 --> 1:44:31.120]  why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, and if you spread
[1:44:31.120 --> 1:44:36.400]  the word about our articles and videos at M4Lords.com, we won't just continue to stand
[1:44:36.400 --> 1:44:39.800]  up against these brutal scumbags, we'll win.
[1:44:39.800 --> 1:44:44.440]  We have huge sales at M4store.com right now, and we're still able to operate the shopping
[1:44:44.440 --> 1:44:47.920]  cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce
[1:44:47.920 --> 1:44:49.880]  and you're right to the market.
[1:44:49.880 --> 1:44:53.560]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Globalist may win.
[1:44:53.560 --> 1:44:58.000]  This is M4Lords Darkest Hour, with your support, I'm counting on you.
[1:45:24.560 --> 1:45:29.240]  This incredible formula can help your body in many ways, including supporting heart health,
[1:45:29.240 --> 1:45:33.920]  joint health and cognitive health, aiding and regulating fat metabolism, helping to maintain
[1:45:33.920 --> 1:45:36.200]  cognitive function and more.
[1:45:36.200 --> 1:45:40.480]  And while other krill oil formulas may chemically modify their formulas, we're giving you the
[1:45:40.480 --> 1:45:45.720]  benefits of a simple formula that contains unmodified high quality krill oil concentrate.
[1:45:45.720 --> 1:45:49.680]  Paired with our ultimate fish oil or used separately, it's time to see what krill oil
[1:45:49.680 --> 1:45:52.160]  can do for you with ultimate krill oil.
[1:45:52.160 --> 1:45:55.160]  Now available at infowarsstore.com.
[1:46:22.160 --> 1:46:25.920]  Simply put, if you want the best at an extremely low price, this is it.
[1:46:25.920 --> 1:46:30.240]  Winner's Sun is the result of our pursuit of the best source of Vitamin D3.
[1:46:30.240 --> 1:46:34.520]  The research and development took over two years, but the result, as verified by independent

[1:47:01.960 --> 1:47:19.720]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:47:19.720 --> 1:47:25.840]  Coming to you from the former United States of America, from deep in the heart of Texas,
[1:47:25.840 --> 1:47:53.640]  Alex Jones.
[1:47:53.640 --> 1:48:01.560]  You know, I'm in a war.
[1:48:01.560 --> 1:48:05.160]  It's scumbag child molesters and devil worshipers.
[1:48:05.160 --> 1:48:08.080]  They know who I am and I know who they are.
[1:48:08.080 --> 1:48:12.040]  They've made a bet that you're a bunch of cowards, you're going to roll over.
[1:48:12.040 --> 1:48:19.800]  You know, the faith gold he was on earlier, a strong, sharp, focused woman, she's talking
[1:48:19.800 --> 1:48:27.040]  about how she's Greek, the whole true story, not mythology, the 300 holding off 100,000.
[1:48:27.040 --> 1:48:30.600]  She was talking about how she's not going to submit and how she's not going to roll
[1:48:30.600 --> 1:48:38.040]  over and how that makes her stronger than I know all these men who would come on this
[1:48:38.040 --> 1:48:43.680]  show as guests, even though on average they weren't that popular of guests.
[1:48:43.680 --> 1:48:54.120]  And you see this six weeks ago, we got black balled by the big corporate systems.
[1:48:54.120 --> 1:48:57.440]  Those men are like, hey, we're not going to come on the show anymore.
[1:48:57.440 --> 1:48:58.920]  We're afraid to get banned ourselves.
[1:48:58.920 --> 1:49:06.280]  Well, you might as well go move to North Korea or Venezuela because you are disgraceful
[1:49:06.280 --> 1:49:07.280]  cowards.
[1:49:07.280 --> 1:49:08.280]  I'm serious.
[1:49:08.280 --> 1:49:14.680]  I think I'm going to start reading out their names on air as if I even need these people
[1:49:14.680 --> 1:49:15.680]  on the show.
[1:49:15.680 --> 1:49:17.840]  The listeners don't even tune in for them.
[1:49:17.840 --> 1:49:24.000]  I've been trying to build up other people, but thank God there's women like Faith Goldie.
[1:49:24.000 --> 1:49:29.840]  Thank God that makes me feel good, but it disgusts me how cowardly men are.
[1:49:29.840 --> 1:49:34.160]  All they think about is looking cool to other men and playing it safe so they get a bigger
[1:49:34.160 --> 1:49:40.440]  house and a bigger cigarette boat so they can strut around, but if an enemy army ever
[1:49:40.440 --> 1:49:49.440]  came over to the hill, they'd roll up and show their bellies because they were raised
[1:49:49.440 --> 1:49:51.200]  by cowards and they're cowards.
[1:49:51.200 --> 1:49:56.880]  And I love how those men always got the act going how big and tough they are.
[1:49:56.880 --> 1:50:01.440]  They all strut around and stick their chest out, but when the rubber meets the road,
[1:50:01.440 --> 1:50:06.240]  they piss their britches and crap their drawers.
[1:50:06.240 --> 1:50:12.280]  And we are hitting the bottom in the cycle right now with a bunch of damn cowards everywhere.
[1:50:12.280 --> 1:50:16.200]  But I tell you, it's good to know there's people that aren't cowards like Matt Drudge
[1:50:16.200 --> 1:50:25.400]  and like Sean Hannity, like Tucker Carlson and like President Trump and you, you.
[1:50:25.400 --> 1:50:31.240]  But you watch people turn and run when the real censorship comes in and try to virtue
[1:50:31.240 --> 1:50:32.240]  signal to it.
[1:50:32.240 --> 1:50:34.920]  It makes me sick.
[1:50:34.920 --> 1:50:39.920]  I know people that have even been host of this show who've hosted years and years ago.
[1:50:39.920 --> 1:50:44.120]  I was scrolling through and saw a video and watched part of it where they were implying
[1:50:44.120 --> 1:50:48.240]  I wanted troops and military on the streets and that I wanted martial law.
[1:50:48.240 --> 1:50:52.480]  When I said the Democrats want to create a civil emergency martial law, Obama put one
[1:50:52.480 --> 1:50:53.480]  in effect.
[1:50:53.480 --> 1:50:57.560]  What are we going to do when they try to launch full scale martial law and then Trump responds
[1:50:57.560 --> 1:51:01.320]  to it, they're going to call that martial law when they've already brought us into martial
[1:51:01.320 --> 1:51:02.320]  law.
[1:51:02.320 --> 1:51:04.680]  We're the ones that expose the global government.
[1:51:04.680 --> 1:51:06.440]  We expose the false flags.
[1:51:06.440 --> 1:51:12.960]  We expose the whole program our listeners did and built the platform into the future
[1:51:12.960 --> 1:51:15.880]  for Trump to write in on.
[1:51:15.880 --> 1:51:19.040]  And thank God he's done what he said he did.
[1:51:19.040 --> 1:51:23.400]  Providence is coming back one more time for America and make no mistake.
[1:51:23.400 --> 1:51:24.400]  This is it.
[1:51:24.400 --> 1:51:31.960]  It's real and it's not that I don't like criticism by people.
[1:51:31.960 --> 1:51:37.720]  It hurts me how if you go on YouTube or you go on Facebook or Twitter and you talk trash
[1:51:37.720 --> 1:51:40.200]  about me, they will promote that.
[1:51:40.200 --> 1:51:47.480]  And so you're getting this fiat currency of promotion that you think is empowering you
[1:51:47.480 --> 1:51:52.840]  and all you've done is not even taken a piece of silver to sell out the truth and to misrepresent
[1:51:52.840 --> 1:51:57.800]  in the compendium what I said and what Mike Adams said.
[1:51:57.800 --> 1:52:04.520]  Mike Adams had to say Trump should declare martial law to get your attention because
[1:52:04.520 --> 1:52:08.640]  martial law isn't just tanks in the streets like Tiananmen Square running over people
[1:52:08.640 --> 1:52:09.800]  and shooting them.
[1:52:09.800 --> 1:52:11.440]  It's a continuum.
[1:52:11.440 --> 1:52:13.280]  It's when the normal rule of law is suspended.
[1:52:13.280 --> 1:52:17.120]  Well, they're trying to overturn the 2016 election.
[1:52:17.120 --> 1:52:19.240]  They're ignoring due process.
[1:52:19.240 --> 1:52:22.240]  They're ignoring innocent till proven guilty.
[1:52:22.240 --> 1:52:24.480]  They're ignoring the whole jurisprudence of this country.
[1:52:24.480 --> 1:52:28.840]  Twitter and Facebook and YouTube and Google are all letting the left organize violent
[1:52:28.840 --> 1:52:35.560]  attacks and crime and kill teams and death threats and everything else.
[1:52:35.560 --> 1:52:37.960]  They have brought us into a civil emergency.
[1:52:37.960 --> 1:52:41.880]  CNN, MSNBC, Shay, we're in a civil emergency.
[1:52:41.880 --> 1:52:46.560]  Weed a national emergency, which they've already gotten place to remove the president.
[1:52:46.560 --> 1:52:48.520]  What do you think the 25th Amendment is?
[1:52:48.520 --> 1:52:50.320]  It's martial law.
[1:52:50.320 --> 1:52:54.280]  It's political Armageddon.
[1:52:54.280 --> 1:53:02.640]  And they have brought us on a Richter scale of martial law, one to ten to about a seven.
[1:53:02.640 --> 1:53:05.440]  And they're trying to push it to an eight or a nine.
[1:53:05.440 --> 1:53:11.000]  Folks, a ten is all of us being put in reeducation camps, which they've actually called for under
[1:53:11.000 --> 1:53:15.000]  Obama in the U.S. Army manual and which Hillary pushed.
[1:53:15.000 --> 1:53:17.800]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[1:53:17.800 --> 1:53:22.000]  So we are two minutes to midnight, 36 days out.
[1:53:22.000 --> 1:53:23.000]  And am I pissed?
[1:53:23.000 --> 1:53:24.000]  Am I angry?
[1:53:24.000 --> 1:53:28.200]  You better believe I am because I'm focused and I'm awake.
[1:53:28.200 --> 1:53:34.640]  And I see the public, to a great extent, asleep, not realizing the magnitude of what
[1:53:34.640 --> 1:53:36.760]  we're facing.
[1:53:36.760 --> 1:53:41.640]  Everybody I know has been suspended or banned from Twitter, Facebook, Google, you name it.
[1:53:41.640 --> 1:53:46.400]  They're calling for world IDs to ban you from buying and selling if big tech doesn't like
[1:53:46.400 --> 1:53:47.400]  you.
[1:53:47.400 --> 1:53:54.120]  It's a literal mark of the beast authoritarianism that should not scare but motivate everyone
[1:53:54.120 --> 1:53:58.240]  to say not just no, but hell no.
[1:53:58.240 --> 1:54:04.000]  Now, I said I'd get to this segment, but it's not ready.
[1:54:04.000 --> 1:54:05.560]  And that's fine.
[1:54:05.560 --> 1:54:12.720]  Sometime today or tomorrow, I'll air the footage we've got that's not shaky of what we shot
[1:54:12.720 --> 1:54:18.360]  down there this weekend at the event that was titled The Rhetoric of Donald Trump and
[1:54:18.360 --> 1:54:19.360]  Alex Jones.
[1:54:19.360 --> 1:54:20.360]  And I'm not pissed.
[1:54:20.360 --> 1:54:21.360]  It was a last minute deal.
[1:54:21.360 --> 1:54:22.360]  Owen had the idea.
[1:54:22.360 --> 1:54:23.360]  He called me at 8 a.m. in the morning.
[1:54:23.360 --> 1:54:27.120]  I'm glad the guy that didn't even a regular camera guy showed up down there to do it and
[1:54:27.120 --> 1:54:29.000]  they were pushing him and he had a long lens.
[1:54:29.000 --> 1:54:30.760]  But Owen shot HD on his camera.
[1:54:30.760 --> 1:54:31.760]  We had that.
[1:54:31.760 --> 1:54:34.760]  So we're going to finally air that for you.
[1:54:34.760 --> 1:54:41.640]  And so the issue is that it's just not ready right now and that's fine.
[1:54:41.640 --> 1:54:42.800]  So maybe it'll air tomorrow or the next day.
[1:54:42.800 --> 1:54:48.640]  But the point is is that is that we have the highlights of Owen down there after I left
[1:54:48.640 --> 1:54:51.360]  wearing a MAGA hat in the midst of these crazy people.
[1:54:51.360 --> 1:54:56.000]  So we will air that because we have that ready and we have a guest joining us Fox News contributor
[1:54:56.000 --> 1:55:01.600]  fired over using pejorative to describe Kavanaugh accusers on Twitter.
[1:55:01.600 --> 1:55:06.040]  He called them skanks, which he damn well has a right to do.
[1:55:06.040 --> 1:55:10.240]  I mean, I wouldn't call that woman a skank.
[1:55:10.240 --> 1:55:14.120]  She looks like a crazy person, escaped from the state hospital.
[1:55:14.120 --> 1:55:18.560]  But I mean, so to most psychologists and psychiatrists, of course, turns out she doesn't even have
[1:55:18.560 --> 1:55:19.840]  her doctorate.
[1:55:19.840 --> 1:55:23.520]  She calls herself a doctor came out the news that she never did the residency for it.
[1:55:23.520 --> 1:55:25.480]  But it's part of the course of these people.
[1:55:25.480 --> 1:55:31.840]  I mean, all I can say is heaven helps.
[1:55:31.840 --> 1:55:37.520]  And then after he leaves us, I will get to the good news that the father of the Internet,
[1:55:37.520 --> 1:55:45.480]  Sir Tim Berners Lee has given several interviews over the weekend saying we have serious authoritarianism.
[1:55:45.480 --> 1:55:51.800]  He's a U.S. citizen now lives in Boston, MIT, invented the Internet as we know it.
[1:55:51.800 --> 1:55:54.400]  And he says, no, the big companies are authoritarian.
[1:55:54.400 --> 1:55:55.400]  They're dangerous.
[1:55:55.400 --> 1:55:59.600]  They're the number one threat to humanity and he's got a plan to bring them down.
[1:55:59.600 --> 1:56:03.840]  But it'll take you actually doing a little bit of work and it'll be great though once
[1:56:03.840 --> 1:56:05.160]  you do it.
[1:56:05.160 --> 1:56:06.680]  And don't worry, we're going to beat Facebook.
[1:56:06.680 --> 1:56:07.680]  We're going to beat Twitter.
[1:56:07.680 --> 1:56:08.680]  We're going to beat Google.
[1:56:08.680 --> 1:56:10.520]  We're going to beat every damn one of them.
[1:56:10.520 --> 1:56:12.480]  We're going to break the back of the communist chai comms.
[1:56:12.480 --> 1:56:13.480]  We're going to free China.
[1:56:13.480 --> 1:56:16.840]  And we're going to go to the stars together, whether you're from Africa, whether you're
[1:56:16.840 --> 1:56:19.960]  from China, whether you're from Russia, whether you're from Mexico, whether you're from the
[1:56:19.960 --> 1:56:25.160]  U.S. or Canada, whether you're from Brazil, whether you're from Uganda, if we can make
[1:56:25.160 --> 1:56:27.120]  it past the globalist, we're going to do it together.
[1:56:27.120 --> 1:56:29.480]  So that's all coming up the next hour.
[1:56:29.480 --> 1:56:32.280]  Kevin Jackson joins us first from KJRadio.com.
[1:56:32.280 --> 1:56:34.560]  Remember, they're doing everything they can.
[1:56:34.560 --> 1:56:35.560]  They're sitting to drill.
[1:56:35.560 --> 1:56:37.720]  They're full power of sorrows to Democrats.
[1:56:37.720 --> 1:56:38.880]  Hillary was supposed to win.
[1:56:38.880 --> 1:56:42.920]  They blamed me for her not winning because you took action.
[1:56:42.920 --> 1:56:43.920]  And I wouldn't go back.
[1:56:43.920 --> 1:56:44.920]  I'm glad.
[1:56:44.920 --> 1:56:47.600]  My whole life, I would have been willing to die.
[1:56:47.600 --> 1:56:48.600]  Doesn't mean I want to die.
[1:56:48.600 --> 1:56:49.600]  Doesn't mean I'm violent.
[1:56:49.600 --> 1:56:50.720]  Doesn't mean I'm a commit suicide.
[1:56:50.720 --> 1:56:51.720]  The opposite.
[1:56:51.720 --> 1:56:53.280]  I'm saying I would be willing to die.
[1:56:53.280 --> 1:56:54.280]  Give me liberty.
[1:56:54.280 --> 1:56:55.280]  Give me death.
[1:56:55.280 --> 1:57:01.320]  Victory or death, whether it's Colonel Travis or whether it's Patrick Henry, get it?
[1:57:01.320 --> 1:57:02.320]  Liberty or death.
[1:57:02.320 --> 1:57:04.840]  You see, they hate the fact I'm committed to death.
[1:57:04.840 --> 1:57:07.840]  I'm committed unto death for life.
[1:57:07.840 --> 1:57:08.840]  So they spend it.
[1:57:08.840 --> 1:57:09.840]  Jones is about to kill himself.
[1:57:09.840 --> 1:57:10.840]  No, it's the opposite.
[1:57:10.840 --> 1:57:11.840]  I shed.
[1:57:11.840 --> 1:57:12.840]  I love life so much.
[1:57:12.840 --> 1:57:19.640]  I'm willing to give mine up if you come after me, if the enemy strikes me down.
[1:57:19.640 --> 1:57:20.640]  That's their issue.
[1:57:20.640 --> 1:57:23.520]  I had a guy spitting on me and hit me in the head and licking my face.
[1:57:23.520 --> 1:57:27.000]  And I just said, I just looked down when it happened.
[1:57:27.000 --> 1:57:29.080]  And it wasn't because I was afraid of him.
[1:57:29.080 --> 1:57:34.280]  I was ready for him to do whatever he wanted to to show that he was the assaulter in the
[1:57:34.280 --> 1:57:36.760]  dirt bag to win.
[1:57:36.760 --> 1:57:40.240]  And of course, that's why then they went and took the videos off YouTube so you couldn't
[1:57:40.240 --> 1:57:41.240]  see them.
[1:57:41.240 --> 1:57:45.920]  But we're going to show the band video coming up next hour.
[1:57:45.920 --> 1:57:46.920]  Stay with us.
[1:57:46.920 --> 1:57:51.680]  It's really hard to have the energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or
[1:57:51.680 --> 1:57:55.960]  to go for a run or go to the park or heck, even take your dogs for a walk.
[1:57:55.960 --> 1:58:00.080]  Believe me, I know I spend hours in front of a screen and then hours in front of bright
[1:58:00.080 --> 1:58:01.920]  lights every day.
[1:58:01.920 --> 1:58:07.200]  But thanks to SuperMailVitality at InfowarsStore.com, I still have that energy.
[1:58:07.200 --> 1:58:11.400]  There's no way I could have the energy at the end of a long day to fight back against
[1:58:11.400 --> 1:58:15.600]  the chemicals and the food and water, to fight back against the modern day lifestyle with
[1:58:15.600 --> 1:58:20.560]  the screen time and the extended hours, to still have the stamina and endurance, energy
[1:58:20.560 --> 1:58:27.800]  and drive, to get to the gym, get to the park and get exercise that you need for your health.
[1:58:27.800 --> 1:58:31.840]  So go to InfowarsStore.com and get SuperMailVitality before it's gone.
[1:58:31.840 --> 1:58:35.480]  This is actually our last run of SuperMailVitality.
[1:58:35.480 --> 1:58:40.360]  So I want you to experience SuperMailVitality before it's too late.
[1:58:40.360 --> 1:58:46.200]  Unleash the SuperMail in you with SuperMailVitality.
[1:58:46.200 --> 1:58:53.040]  The scientists at InfowarsLife have created a powerful formula for inflammatory support
[1:58:53.040 --> 1:58:54.800]  and joint support.
[1:58:54.800 --> 1:58:57.960]  Remember the power of ancient medicine with bodies.
[1:58:57.960 --> 1:59:01.760]  Bodies contains one of the most potent forms of turmeric available.
[1:59:01.760 --> 1:59:06.120]  Turmeric has been used for thousands of years and is one of the most studied herbals today.
[1:59:06.120 --> 1:59:10.280]  It is well known in traditional medicine for its soothing properties.
[1:59:10.280 --> 1:59:14.520]  Our pure turmeric extract plus peppering from black pepper makes for optimal absorption
[1:59:14.520 --> 1:59:19.720]  to help boost and support your flexibility, mobility, joint function, immune system and
[1:59:19.720 --> 1:59:21.520]  so much more.
[1:59:21.520 --> 1:59:25.960]  Our turmeric root from the store only contains one to five percent of active ingredients.
[1:59:25.960 --> 1:59:31.720]  But our turmeric root extract contains over 95 percent of the active ingredients.
[1:59:31.720 --> 1:59:37.640]  Bodies combines turmeric with organic herbs such as spearmint, sage, lemon balm and thyme
[1:59:37.640 --> 1:59:40.560]  to work synergistically for full body support.
[1:59:40.560 --> 1:59:51.440]  Try bodies today at InfowarsLife.com or call us at 1-88-253-3139.
[1:59:51.440 --> 2:00:18.240]  We are listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:00:18.240 --> 2:00:42.960]  Music
[2:00:42.960 --> 2:00:58.840]  Let's look at the Kavanaugh Psyop and then we'll talk to former Fox News contributor
[2:00:58.840 --> 2:01:03.000]  that dared question Lord and Savior Dr. Ford.
[2:01:03.000 --> 2:01:10.440]  I wanted Amy Coney Barrett, a beautiful woman, great judge, a constitutionalist, a patriot.
[2:01:10.440 --> 2:01:14.920]  But don't think Trump can try her next if Kavanaugh fails.
[2:01:14.920 --> 2:01:16.800]  I think we're on Razor's Edge right now.
[2:01:16.800 --> 2:01:22.000]  There are going to be women saying that she gang raped them with fire hoses, folks.
[2:01:22.000 --> 2:01:25.440]  So the Democrats aren't going to stop.
[2:01:25.440 --> 2:01:31.000]  That's why they're death-threading everybody at the restaurant, we're crusade now.
[2:01:31.000 --> 2:01:33.200]  I mean, I deal with these people.
[2:01:33.200 --> 2:01:35.960]  They are mad dog.
[2:01:35.960 --> 2:01:41.560]  They don't do anything because their religion is dominating the American people.
[2:01:41.560 --> 2:01:47.160]  We believe survivors, we believe survivors, we believe survivors, we believe survivors.
[2:01:47.160 --> 2:01:49.360]  They know it's way hotter than you do.
[2:01:49.360 --> 2:01:54.360]  And then when the Republicans talk to her, she goes, we're sorry, we're sorry.
[2:01:54.360 --> 2:01:55.360]  You're right.
[2:01:55.360 --> 2:01:58.080]  Kavanaugh, we'll have Kavanaugh executed, okay?
[2:01:58.080 --> 2:02:01.600]  And then the headlines, I've got them right here.
[2:02:01.600 --> 2:02:06.560]  Tonight, an anonymous woman called the switchboard was put through and she says, she saw her
[2:02:06.560 --> 2:02:07.560]  daughter raped by him.
[2:02:07.560 --> 2:02:11.120]  She wouldn't say where she was or what year, but that's the fourth person.
[2:02:11.120 --> 2:02:16.320]  As an allegation of misconduct, we should underscore that it is an anonymous allegation.
[2:02:16.320 --> 2:02:21.080]  This is unlike the other three allegations that we have been discussing throughout the
[2:02:21.080 --> 2:02:22.080]  course of today.
[2:02:22.080 --> 2:02:26.880]  So I guess they might just randomly call the capital switchboard and say I raped somebody.
[2:02:26.880 --> 2:02:31.840]  In fact, I thought about calling the capital switchboard myself and going, hello, my name's
[2:02:31.840 --> 2:02:34.960]  Alice, but I'm not going to tell you who I am or where I am.
[2:02:34.960 --> 2:02:38.720]  Brett Kavanaugh gang raped me with 14 elves.
[2:02:38.720 --> 2:02:42.720]  Yes, it was 49 years ago.
[2:02:42.720 --> 2:02:49.720]  And Brett Kavanaugh, he also played my skin and pulled my fingernails out with pliers.
[2:02:49.720 --> 2:02:53.880]  And then he had an electric drill and he drilled my kneecaps.
[2:02:53.880 --> 2:02:55.880]  Yes ma'am, we're very sorry.
[2:02:55.880 --> 2:02:56.880]  Now this is anonymous.
[2:02:56.880 --> 2:03:03.720]  I'm not going to tell you where or when, just okay, Kavanaugh's evil, click.
[2:03:03.720 --> 2:03:09.040]  Anonymous accuser says Kavanaugh drilled their kneecaps with a black and decker drill.
[2:03:09.040 --> 2:03:15.360]  I think when you really look at it all, it's not going to change any of the Democrats minds.
[2:03:15.360 --> 2:03:17.760]  They're obstructionists.
[2:03:17.760 --> 2:03:21.880]  They're actually con artists because they know how quality this man is and they've destroyed
[2:03:21.880 --> 2:03:25.600]  a man's reputation and they want to destroy it even more.
[2:03:25.600 --> 2:03:27.600]  And I think people are going to see that in the midterms.
[2:03:27.600 --> 2:03:32.000]  What they've done to this family, what they've done to these children, these beautiful children
[2:03:32.000 --> 2:03:36.040]  of his and what they've done to his wife.
[2:03:36.040 --> 2:03:39.200]  And they know it's a big fat con job.
[2:03:39.200 --> 2:03:44.240]  I forgot about the fifth one they've already was drawn because it was drawn as broad.
[2:03:44.240 --> 2:03:45.240]  That's right.
[2:03:45.240 --> 2:03:49.000]  There was another anonymous that was put forward also by Sheldon Whitehouse, Democrat Senator
[2:03:49.000 --> 2:03:55.880]  from Rhode Island, and this was a guy who had heard that some girl had been assaulted
[2:03:55.880 --> 2:03:57.080]  by Brett Kavanaugh.
[2:03:57.080 --> 2:03:58.720]  He did it anonymously.
[2:03:58.720 --> 2:04:00.760]  They figured out who this guy was.
[2:04:00.760 --> 2:04:05.440]  And as soon as his name was released, he said, no, no, no, I take it back, I was mistaken.
[2:04:05.440 --> 2:04:11.440]  The primary impact was in the initial four years after the event.
[2:04:11.440 --> 2:04:14.280]  I struggled academically.
[2:04:14.280 --> 2:04:19.080]  I struggled very much in Chapel Hill and in college.
[2:04:19.080 --> 2:04:27.160]  As you're sitting there with the Deep State top lawyer for McCabe and Comey and all of
[2:04:27.160 --> 2:04:31.360]  them, I mean, I just can't and he they're just relishing and when she talks, the women
[2:04:31.360 --> 2:04:34.120]  are all looking at her and shaking their heads like, oh, you poor baby.
[2:04:34.120 --> 2:04:38.560]  Oh my God, you've been through so much and they're just relishing this and then she
[2:04:38.560 --> 2:04:44.760]  sycophantically smiles and looks up at Feinstein, like, am I pleasing you?
[2:04:44.760 --> 2:04:46.960]  And it's just all this victimology.
[2:04:46.960 --> 2:04:49.680]  That's what everyone is into.
[2:04:49.680 --> 2:04:51.440]  This is how you destroy a country right here.
[2:04:51.440 --> 2:04:56.600]  Meanwhile, China executes you if you're gay.
[2:04:56.600 --> 2:05:01.800]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[2:05:01.800 --> 2:05:06.200]  InfoWords is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, left to CIA operatives, the corrupt
[2:05:06.200 --> 2:05:09.600]  justice department and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[2:05:09.600 --> 2:05:12.360]  People say, why would you sort of fight with them?
[2:05:12.360 --> 2:05:16.360]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground and I knew we had
[2:05:16.360 --> 2:05:17.360]  no future.
[2:05:17.360 --> 2:05:18.360]  We didn't do this.
[2:05:18.360 --> 2:05:20.680]  So we've already had incredible success.
[2:05:20.680 --> 2:05:25.560]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is and understand how real this fight is and
[2:05:25.560 --> 2:05:30.400]  why we've been made the main target and if you financially support us and if you spread
[2:05:30.400 --> 2:05:36.120]  the word about our articles and videos, infowords.com, we won't just continue to stand up against
[2:05:36.120 --> 2:05:37.920]  these brutal scum bags.
[2:05:37.920 --> 2:05:38.920]  We'll win.
[2:05:38.920 --> 2:05:43.760]  We have huge sales at infowords.com right now and we're still able to operate the shopping
[2:05:43.760 --> 2:05:47.200]  cart and get stuff shipped out to you despite the fact that we're trying to block our commerce
[2:05:47.200 --> 2:05:49.200]  and you're right to the market.
[2:05:49.200 --> 2:05:52.880]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and Global Spain win.
[2:05:52.880 --> 2:06:18.880]  This is InfoWars Darkness Hour, we're your support, I'm counting on you.
[2:06:18.880 --> 2:06:36.080]  Well, as you know, last week, the New York Times had a poll out for a few hours saying
[2:06:36.080 --> 2:06:42.600]  do you think the testimony of Dr. Ford, turns out she never even did a residency, so she's
[2:06:42.600 --> 2:06:46.960]  not a doctor, that Dr. Ford.
[2:06:46.960 --> 2:06:51.600]  And I said hell no, I don't believe her, her dad and grandfather were both high level CIA,
[2:06:51.600 --> 2:06:56.640]  her brother is, she comes out of the law firm, her family does, Baker Hosteller that cooked
[2:06:56.640 --> 2:07:03.200]  up the fake Piscate dossier, that's now all come out.
[2:07:03.200 --> 2:07:06.880]  And then you've got her story, you've got the prosecutors saying none of it adds up
[2:07:06.880 --> 2:07:10.760]  and giving them a whole list of her saying it doesn't add up and then you've got Cabinon
[2:07:10.760 --> 2:07:15.400]  beating people up and raping people on boats, not true and attacking people in Colorado,
[2:07:15.400 --> 2:07:17.400]  not true.
[2:07:17.400 --> 2:07:21.520]  I don't know if I'd call her a skank, because you know, in a way there's something attractive
[2:07:21.520 --> 2:07:26.800]  about a wall woman at least, but you know, he's got a right to say that.
[2:07:26.800 --> 2:07:30.920]  Kevin Jackson, well I didn't know who Kevin Jackson was, I saw him on the sky, but I've
[2:07:30.920 --> 2:07:34.680]  seen that, Oliver Fox and listen to his, I heard him on the radio and read articles,
[2:07:34.680 --> 2:07:38.280]  he's a really smart guy, I'm like, wow, that Kevin Jackson got fired?
[2:07:38.280 --> 2:07:42.840]  Kevin Jackson's a former Fox contributor as of this weekend, fired for his tweets about
[2:07:42.840 --> 2:07:48.680]  Barrett Cabinon's accusers, he is the best-selling author and a syndicated radio host, kjradio.com,
[2:07:48.680 --> 2:07:51.600]  bleedingbloomovie.com, which I've heard all about.
[2:07:51.600 --> 2:07:56.200]  So he's joining us now and you know, it's like the eyes don't ever connect names, they're
[2:07:56.200 --> 2:07:57.960]  like, oh yeah, I love that guy.
[2:07:57.960 --> 2:08:00.920]  So he's on with us at least until 45 after them, we're going to air this, this piece
[2:08:00.920 --> 2:08:05.840]  where they had a city-sponsored event saying, I'm fake, it should be taken off the air called
[2:08:05.840 --> 2:08:09.160]  the rhetoric of Donald Trump and Alex Jones and how to stop fake news.
[2:08:09.160 --> 2:08:14.200]  So I showed up, they all had the police take me away, but whatever, the police were apologizing
[2:08:14.200 --> 2:08:16.560]  for it, but it's still just crazy.
[2:08:16.560 --> 2:08:20.320]  So that's coming up the last segment, we're going to cover the whole Cabinon situation
[2:08:20.320 --> 2:08:28.080]  because we knew it was coming, A, the free speech attacks, but B, now it's perjury investigation
[2:08:28.080 --> 2:08:34.000]  because somebody at Yale said a guy got in his face and he threw beer on him and then
[2:08:34.000 --> 2:08:35.000]  that guy got arrested.
[2:08:35.000 --> 2:08:39.640]  There's not even a record of this, but notice he never got arrested.
[2:08:39.640 --> 2:08:41.640]  Who knows if it's even true.
[2:08:41.640 --> 2:08:47.440]  I mean, I saw Brett Cabinon at Yale 34 years ago, you know, having sex with a donkey.
[2:08:47.440 --> 2:08:50.140]  I mean, it's not true, but I guess I can say it.
[2:08:50.140 --> 2:08:52.440]  So Kevin Jackson, thanks for joining us.
[2:08:52.440 --> 2:08:55.560]  This is just getting absolutely out of control.
[2:08:55.560 --> 2:08:58.320]  Hello, my name is Peggy.
[2:08:58.320 --> 2:08:59.320]  That's right.
[2:08:59.320 --> 2:09:05.480]  And I tell you, so, so, so, so Fox chopped your head off for calling these women skanks.
[2:09:05.480 --> 2:09:09.440]  Well, what I said, and I don't have the actual tweet, I don't really care because I still
[2:09:09.440 --> 2:09:15.960]  stand by the notion that there is such a thing as a skank and there are skanks in that are
[2:09:15.960 --> 2:09:19.920]  men, there are skanks that are women, there are dogs that are men, there are dogs that
[2:09:19.920 --> 2:09:20.920]  are women.
[2:09:20.920 --> 2:09:22.440]  I mean, there's, pick your terminology.
[2:09:22.440 --> 2:09:28.200]  I mean, Samantha B called Vanka Trump, a Trump, a feckless, you know what?
[2:09:28.200 --> 2:09:33.600]  And Bill Mark called Sarah Palin, a T-W-A-T, I'll just spell it because I don't know who
[2:09:33.600 --> 2:09:35.960]  your audience is going to here, Alex.
[2:09:35.960 --> 2:09:41.480]  But you know, look, Fox has a right to do whatever they want to do and they, they reacted.
[2:09:41.480 --> 2:09:45.640]  But what I will tell you are guys like you and me who are out there, you know, trying
[2:09:45.640 --> 2:09:50.200]  to spread the truth and talk about things in reality.
[2:09:50.200 --> 2:09:53.680]  There's a reason why we've got a level of popularity that other people don't have and
[2:09:53.680 --> 2:09:58.360]  the fact that I'm not afraid to say what I wanted to say about them and worry about the
[2:09:58.360 --> 2:10:02.520]  consequences, certainly doesn't make me a sell out for all of the black people that call
[2:10:02.520 --> 2:10:04.520]  me that from pretty much every day.
[2:10:04.520 --> 2:10:07.840]  No, it's the opposite of a sell out, same thing with Kanye West.
[2:10:07.840 --> 2:10:12.120]  The opposite of a sell out, them trying to bully him, not to support Trump or myself
[2:10:12.120 --> 2:10:13.520]  at Saturday Night Live.
[2:10:13.520 --> 2:10:18.040]  You know, you know what, that was a great thing and I've been doing this thing around
[2:10:18.040 --> 2:10:20.680]  college campuses called the Kanye effect.
[2:10:20.680 --> 2:10:25.000]  And what it was, Alex, if you want to talk about that for just a bit, Kanye, like Donald
[2:10:25.000 --> 2:10:29.120]  Trump before he became president, he said in an interview, he goes, look, rappers,
[2:10:29.120 --> 2:10:33.720]  hip hop guys made rhymes, looking for ways to put Trump into their rhymes, including
[2:10:33.720 --> 2:10:34.920]  Snoop Dogg.
[2:10:34.920 --> 2:10:38.360]  But the minute that Donald Trump becomes president of the United States, suddenly you
[2:10:38.360 --> 2:10:40.320]  got to abandon your friend.
[2:10:40.320 --> 2:10:44.480]  And that weighed on him so much that I think it ended up putting him in some sort of rehab
[2:10:44.480 --> 2:10:47.160]  because he was thinking about all the money that he could lose.
[2:10:47.160 --> 2:10:52.360]  Look, I just lost a pretty fat contract with, with Fox, but I'll tell you this, I still
[2:10:52.360 --> 2:10:54.200]  stand true to who I am.
[2:10:54.200 --> 2:10:55.200]  And that's the problem.
[2:10:55.200 --> 2:10:58.640]  Let me ask you this, at a gut level, aren't you even feeling better about yourself?
[2:10:58.640 --> 2:11:00.680]  Aren't you feeling more like a man?
[2:11:00.680 --> 2:11:02.920]  Because when I get persecuted, I'm not looking for trouble.
[2:11:02.920 --> 2:11:09.760]  I love being successful and monitoring support, but at the same time, not if I have to give
[2:11:09.760 --> 2:11:11.160]  up my soul.
[2:11:11.160 --> 2:11:15.200]  I wish I could answer yes to that, Alex, but I've always felt like a man from the moment
[2:11:15.200 --> 2:11:19.320]  I hit manhood and, you know, and maybe it has to do with having a lot of black belts
[2:11:19.320 --> 2:11:24.800]  in the, you know, the, the disposition of a man, I'm saying get, get getting knocked
[2:11:24.800 --> 2:11:28.720]  down a little bit for telling the truth, make you feel good in the ways what I'm saying.
[2:11:28.720 --> 2:11:32.560]  It did in a way because I knew I was standing on principle and it felt good to get, you
[2:11:32.560 --> 2:11:37.080]  know, my, my loyal fans were like Kevin Way to go and, and thanks for doing that.
[2:11:37.080 --> 2:11:41.320]  But I'll tell you, to answer your question in that regard, I got up the next day and
[2:11:41.320 --> 2:11:46.640]  I tweeted to the leftist that if you think you measure me by Fox, you pick the wrong
[2:11:46.640 --> 2:11:47.640]  Negro.
[2:11:47.640 --> 2:11:52.760]  I'm a free range Negro and I've always thought for myself and this is not going to do anything
[2:11:52.760 --> 2:11:57.560]  for me except strengthen my resolve to wake up every day, kicking your asses.
[2:11:57.560 --> 2:11:58.800]  And that's essentially what I did.
[2:11:58.800 --> 2:11:59.920]  Every single day I wake up.
[2:11:59.920 --> 2:12:03.600]  That's my first tweet of the morning is how bad I'm going to kick the butts of the left.
[2:12:03.600 --> 2:12:05.560]  And then I go on with my normal day.
[2:12:05.560 --> 2:12:06.560]  Exactly.
[2:12:06.560 --> 2:12:10.840]  So that's where I stand being the platform, going after our credit card processors.
[2:12:10.840 --> 2:12:12.400]  Dead threats, all of it.
[2:12:12.400 --> 2:12:14.640]  It's like that proves you're as bad as I thought.
[2:12:14.640 --> 2:12:18.760]  Now I got to fight even harder, you know, we, we know Alex to, to the, to your point
[2:12:18.760 --> 2:12:19.920]  of what they did to you.
[2:12:19.920 --> 2:12:24.440]  I mean, I look at what happened to me as minor, honestly, in comparison to the, to the attack
[2:12:24.440 --> 2:12:25.440]  that's on you.
[2:12:25.440 --> 2:12:27.120]  And I'm not saying that because I'm on your show.
[2:12:27.120 --> 2:12:28.280]  I've admired your work.
[2:12:28.280 --> 2:12:33.520]  Obviously they've tried to demonize you and make you sort of this alt-right, crazy guy,
[2:12:33.520 --> 2:12:36.720]  conspiracy theorist, but it, it isn't too much conspiracy when stuff starts to happen
[2:12:36.720 --> 2:12:37.720]  and it's correct.
[2:12:37.720 --> 2:12:40.160]  Now in my case, it was a targeted attack.
[2:12:40.160 --> 2:12:42.320]  They said, we're going to get rid of Jackson.
[2:12:42.320 --> 2:12:45.240]  He won't be on Fox and everybody's like, enjoy unemployment.
[2:12:45.240 --> 2:12:48.240]  These clowns don't even realize we work for ourselves.
[2:12:48.240 --> 2:12:49.240]  And you know what?
[2:12:49.240 --> 2:12:52.000]  The majority of the people that are going to support us will continue to support us.
[2:12:52.000 --> 2:12:53.880]  So kudos to you.
[2:12:53.880 --> 2:12:57.520]  And I, and I hope man, you know, look, everybody was at the first thing that happened to be
[2:12:57.520 --> 2:13:01.240]  a lot of people were like, Kevin, you got to call Alex and you guys partner up on something.
[2:13:01.240 --> 2:13:05.440]  You know, look, I'm, I'm game for anything that's going to get the truth out there that
[2:13:05.440 --> 2:13:06.960]  is going to be reality.
[2:13:06.960 --> 2:13:10.840]  And I want to make sure that there are no more black kids growing up afraid to speak
[2:13:10.840 --> 2:13:11.840]  their mind.
[2:13:11.840 --> 2:13:16.440]  I think your instinct is key here, that we need to get all the real talent being censored
[2:13:16.440 --> 2:13:21.480]  somehow together, at least on some projects, because the power of all of us, we've been
[2:13:21.480 --> 2:13:26.920]  taken off the air, not because we're not popular like Tucker Carlson said, but because
[2:13:26.920 --> 2:13:27.920]  we are popular.
[2:13:27.920 --> 2:13:28.920]  Absolutely.
[2:13:28.920 --> 2:13:33.920]  Well, look, I'm a management consultant by training and I mean, my degrees are engineering,
[2:13:33.920 --> 2:13:37.200]  computer science and math, electrical engineering.
[2:13:37.200 --> 2:13:40.840]  And when I got out of that, I went into management consulting and the first thing that I noticed
[2:13:40.840 --> 2:13:44.440]  when I got out of that and came to doing this was the risk.
[2:13:44.440 --> 2:13:48.840]  And I told people, I said, look, Google, Facebook, Twitter, all these social media platforms,
[2:13:48.840 --> 2:13:49.840]  they hate us.
[2:13:49.840 --> 2:13:54.160]  They're going to cut off our windpipe at some point and we're seeing that happen.
[2:13:54.160 --> 2:13:58.960]  So I started the thing called tea party community.org, which was to combat Facebook.
[2:13:58.960 --> 2:14:02.200]  And here's what I don't like about the conservative movement, Alex.
[2:14:02.200 --> 2:14:05.920]  And it's not so much true for your fans because they're, they're a rabid, you know, Alex Jones
[2:14:05.920 --> 2:14:10.240]  supporters, but the average conservative, unfortunately, is a wishy washy pansy.
[2:14:10.240 --> 2:14:13.520]  They're too passive and they love to get liberal approval.
[2:14:13.520 --> 2:14:14.640]  You're exactly right.
[2:14:14.640 --> 2:14:20.280]  And so here I've got 200,000 people on this site and it should be 20 million.
[2:14:20.280 --> 2:14:23.960]  And I just want people to think about how fast we would grow.
[2:14:23.960 --> 2:14:27.680]  What would happen if Donald Trump started tweeting it?
[2:14:27.680 --> 2:14:28.680]  Exactly.
[2:14:28.680 --> 2:14:33.440]  I mean, think about the power, Alex, of you having 20 million people behind you, not having
[2:14:33.440 --> 2:14:37.360]  to worry about advertisers, not having to worry about, you know, anything because you've
[2:14:37.360 --> 2:14:41.720]  got 20 million people that are ready to, to respond to whatever it is that we, the call
[2:14:41.720 --> 2:14:43.840]  of duty that is for that day.
[2:14:43.840 --> 2:14:44.840]  What could we do?
[2:14:44.840 --> 2:14:45.840]  What if it was 60 million?
[2:14:45.840 --> 2:14:50.600]  Look, we'd own politics if we had a fraction of what the left have with respect to social
[2:14:50.600 --> 2:14:52.800]  media, because we have truth on our side.
[2:14:52.800 --> 2:14:53.800]  I want to hear about this.
[2:14:53.800 --> 2:14:57.440]  How about the inventor of the internet, not Al Gore, the real guy, saying the same thing
[2:14:57.440 --> 2:14:58.440]  you're saying.
[2:14:58.440 --> 2:15:02.400]  The internet, not this segment, the next segment, the next segment, I want to get into what
[2:15:02.400 --> 2:15:05.840]  you think about the election, cabinon, gut level, where you think this is going, where
[2:15:05.840 --> 2:15:09.680]  you think the left's going to go next, because here's the thing, they are just ramping everything
[2:15:09.680 --> 2:15:14.280]  up because before they were arrogant and really thought Hillary was going to win, we lost
[2:15:14.280 --> 2:15:18.000]  some of that arrogance when Trump won and now they're totally panicked.
[2:15:18.000 --> 2:15:19.240]  So they're now a dangerous enemy.
[2:15:19.240 --> 2:15:21.040]  So I don't want to underestimate them.
[2:15:21.040 --> 2:15:27.240]  When we come back, we'll talk to Kevin Jackson, kjradio.com, Fox News contributor, really
[2:15:27.240 --> 2:15:32.400]  smart guy, banned for pointing out that he thinks these people are totally full of crap,
[2:15:32.400 --> 2:15:36.360]  which is his right to do, plus they've been proven to be full of B.S.H.
[2:15:36.360 --> 2:15:40.200]  But again, they want to have their rhetoric kill Trump, kill his family, kill everybody.
[2:15:40.200 --> 2:15:41.200]  We're not saying that.
[2:15:41.200 --> 2:15:42.200]  That's not free speech.
[2:15:42.200 --> 2:15:46.760]  We're being banned and kicked off the air for telling the truth that these people are
[2:15:46.760 --> 2:15:47.760]  a pack of liars.
[2:15:47.760 --> 2:15:48.760]  We'll be right back.
[2:15:48.760 --> 2:15:49.760]  Stay with us.
[2:15:49.760 --> 2:15:56.760]  We'll be right back.
[2:16:19.760 --> 2:16:46.440]  We'll be right back.
[2:16:46.440 --> 2:16:53.440]  We're calling 877-886-3653, 877-886-3653, goberky.com.
[2:16:53.440 --> 2:16:57.800]  Let's talk tough.
[2:16:57.800 --> 2:16:59.200]  Let's talk comfort.
[2:16:59.200 --> 2:17:06.440]  Let's talk about down home value made in the USA blue jeans like you wore as a kid.
[2:17:06.440 --> 2:17:07.440]  Remember?
[2:17:07.440 --> 2:17:15.920]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[2:17:15.920 --> 2:17:25.560]  They so pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit, and put a diamond gusset

[2:20:07.440 --> 2:20:33.440]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[2:20:33.440 --> 2:20:44.040]  Kevin Jackson is our guest.
[2:20:44.040 --> 2:20:50.120]  Fox News' former contributor got fired for...I'll read some of the quotes here, but here's
[2:20:50.120 --> 2:20:51.120]  the issue.
[2:20:51.120 --> 2:20:52.120]  It's all selective.
[2:20:52.120 --> 2:20:57.040]  Libertarians, Nationalist conservatives, we can't say anything.
[2:20:57.040 --> 2:21:01.360]  But the left, major anti-fagroups with hundreds of thousands of followers can say, don't just
[2:21:01.360 --> 2:21:08.880]  kill Ted Cruz, or Vice President Pence, led by this New York City professor, leading groups
[2:21:08.880 --> 2:21:12.360]  in D.C., we need to kill the staff.
[2:21:12.360 --> 2:21:17.640]  We need to, is what those Twitter accounts from Antifa were saying, kill the staff for
[2:21:17.640 --> 2:21:19.360]  serving Ted Cruz.
[2:21:19.360 --> 2:21:23.880]  And this is happening all over the country, where there was a case in the news there was
[2:21:23.880 --> 2:21:31.800]  a gay owner of the most popular restaurant in Houston, and the governor was down there,
[2:21:31.800 --> 2:21:36.080]  and they took a picture and put it on Twitter of famous people, and Facebook did have been
[2:21:36.080 --> 2:21:37.080]  there.
[2:21:37.080 --> 2:21:40.800]  They protested it so bad the owners got rid of all their social media, and may just close
[2:21:40.800 --> 2:21:43.920]  the restaurant now, the restaurant may close.
[2:21:43.920 --> 2:21:48.200]  This is bizarre bullying, and it's getting crazier and crazier, so I want to ask Kevin
[2:21:48.200 --> 2:21:54.820]  Jackson, before we get into Kavanaugh, what do you think peak Trump derangement syndrome
[2:21:54.820 --> 2:21:56.820]  will look like?
[2:21:56.820 --> 2:22:02.440]  Because it's getting crazier and wilder, and their wish to persecute people, and censor
[2:22:02.440 --> 2:22:08.520]  people of some authoritarian, A, how bad will it get, and B, how big will the backlash be?
[2:22:08.520 --> 2:22:13.440]  I think you're going to see somebody get killed, and eventually the left is going to finally
[2:22:13.440 --> 2:22:15.640]  wake up and start seeing just how crazy they are.
[2:22:15.640 --> 2:22:20.080]  Look it's already starting in academia, you got professors that said we have raised a
[2:22:20.080 --> 2:22:26.040]  bunch of feral animals here, and we can't handle it, so you have groups like, I can't
[2:22:26.040 --> 2:22:30.360]  recall the name now, but there's a group of professors that formed that said we've gone
[2:22:30.360 --> 2:22:31.720]  too far.
[2:22:31.720 --> 2:22:38.240]  We let this political correctness, this snowflake generation take it to a level that's untenable,
[2:22:38.240 --> 2:22:39.400]  and so they're chasing them out.
[2:22:39.400 --> 2:22:43.200]  Remember the professor that they wanted to have only blacks on campus day at Evergreen
[2:22:43.200 --> 2:22:47.320]  College, and this white professor didn't get the word, so he's on campus, they chased
[2:22:47.320 --> 2:22:50.400]  him off that college, and he never went back.
[2:22:50.400 --> 2:22:52.440]  So that's the type of thing you're seeing.
[2:22:52.440 --> 2:22:56.960]  And look, we're talking about name calling, look, there's nobody on the planet that gets
[2:22:56.960 --> 2:22:58.800]  called worse names than a black conservative.
[2:22:58.800 --> 2:23:02.960]  I could give you 50 without even breaking a sweat, and I'll clean one up for you.
[2:23:02.960 --> 2:23:07.800]  I get called Coon Butt Negro, in a different way, Steppen Fetch and Uncle Tom Cooley the
[2:23:07.800 --> 2:23:13.160]  Man, Opera Thomas, Rush Limbaugh want to be all kinds of things, and they get worse
[2:23:13.160 --> 2:23:14.160]  than that.
[2:23:14.160 --> 2:23:17.080]  Well, we've all seen the ICE footage, and they'll be like 30 officers and two or three
[2:23:17.080 --> 2:23:21.320]  have to be black, and the white people are screaming N-word at them, and then the left
[2:23:21.320 --> 2:23:24.560]  goes, well, that's okay as long as they're working for the government, as if you work
[2:23:24.560 --> 2:23:27.400]  for the government, now you deserve to be called that if you're anybody.
[2:23:27.400 --> 2:23:31.080]  Now, let me tell you, it's okay, it's funny, I was talking about this the other day, Alex,
[2:23:31.080 --> 2:23:36.680]  it's okay to call, for a white person to call a black man the N-word, as long as you're
[2:23:36.680 --> 2:23:38.080]  directing it a conservative.
[2:23:38.080 --> 2:23:41.040]  Blacks allow it, and white leftists will allow it.
[2:23:41.040 --> 2:23:45.000]  The tolerance of that side of the aisle is ridiculous, and that's why when people ask
[2:23:45.000 --> 2:23:49.360]  me what do you do, I tell you, I will get in your grill, I will fight you back in a New
[2:23:49.360 --> 2:23:50.360]  York minute.
[2:23:50.360 --> 2:23:53.760]  I'm trained to fight for that reason, and it's a sad state of affairs that I've had
[2:23:53.760 --> 2:23:59.960]  to train four boys, three of whom are men now, to fight just to stand up for what they
[2:23:59.960 --> 2:24:00.960]  believe in.
[2:24:00.960 --> 2:24:07.480]  But it's going to take more beatings and finally killings, I think, with us being the victims,
[2:24:07.480 --> 2:24:10.920]  and then finally, we start fighting back, and then it starts happening to them, and
[2:24:10.920 --> 2:24:14.680]  I think once that occurs, when we start whooping that butt, then you're going to see guys
[2:24:14.680 --> 2:24:16.360]  going, okay, you better leave them alone.
[2:24:16.360 --> 2:24:20.280]  I was about to say, they banned Proud Boys off Twitter, calling them Nazis when they're
[2:24:20.280 --> 2:24:25.120]  the opposite, because they go out and tend to one, when these anti-fab, meth-head white
[2:24:25.120 --> 2:24:29.680]  guys come over with clubs, with extendable batons and try to kill them, they fight back
[2:24:29.680 --> 2:24:33.200]  and knock them out, and the left calls that bullying, if I try to hit you in the head
[2:24:33.200 --> 2:24:38.640]  with a device that could kill you, and then I take you out, you're a bully, so they got
[2:24:38.640 --> 2:24:41.720]  their Twitter accounts banned for that video right there.
[2:24:41.720 --> 2:24:42.720]  Unbelievable.
[2:24:42.720 --> 2:24:46.080]  Well, let me tell you, I'm going to be kicked off Twitter, because if I'm ever in one of
[2:24:46.080 --> 2:24:49.360]  those situations, you're going to watch me go to jail, but I will have taken out about
[2:24:49.360 --> 2:24:53.600]  10 or 15 of those thugs, because the thing is, they don't want you to fight.
[2:24:53.600 --> 2:24:54.600]  That's what they want.
[2:24:54.600 --> 2:24:58.000]  They want to beat us down verbally, and then they want to beat us down physically.
[2:24:58.000 --> 2:25:02.680]  And Alex, let's face it, over the past few decades, man, what we exist if the Republican
[2:25:02.680 --> 2:25:05.640]  Party, if the conservative movement was doing what it's supposed to be doing.
[2:25:05.640 --> 2:25:09.880]  I mean, look, man, I don't know what you like to do, I got better things to do.
[2:25:09.880 --> 2:25:13.360]  I got a lot of, I love to go out and hike, I love to go fishing.
[2:25:13.360 --> 2:25:14.840]  I don't want to be doing this all the time.
[2:25:14.840 --> 2:25:18.520]  I don't want to go out to a restaurant with my family, and people walk over and go, F
[2:25:18.520 --> 2:25:21.200]  you Nazi and knock my drink over in my face.
[2:25:21.200 --> 2:25:22.200]  Right.
[2:25:22.200 --> 2:25:24.880]  And so I look at, why are we doing this?
[2:25:24.880 --> 2:25:30.600]  We, and it takes some guts, dude, to get up in the morning, go face these people, face
[2:25:30.600 --> 2:25:33.520]  to face, and I'm not doing it for myself.
[2:25:33.520 --> 2:25:39.080]  I could, you either, we could go into obscurity, never be bothered again for the most part,
[2:25:39.080 --> 2:25:41.000]  and they would be happy they got rid of us.
[2:25:41.000 --> 2:25:46.200]  But we do it because this country means something, and the fact that we have children, grandchildren,
[2:25:46.200 --> 2:25:47.760]  and I see what's going on in the world.
[2:25:47.760 --> 2:25:50.560]  And I know what I was about to say, it's going to get a lot worse.
[2:25:50.560 --> 2:25:55.000]  That's the thing is, they say they want to imprison conservatives.
[2:25:55.000 --> 2:25:56.600]  They say they want to break up families.
[2:25:56.600 --> 2:25:58.800]  I mean, they're really villainous.
[2:25:58.800 --> 2:25:59.800]  Think about it, Alex.
[2:25:59.800 --> 2:26:03.880]  They want to break up families because we don't want to bring illegals into our country.
[2:26:03.880 --> 2:26:04.880]  They want to break us.
[2:26:04.880 --> 2:26:08.200]  They want to put us in jail because we use the wrong pronoun in California.
[2:26:08.200 --> 2:26:13.120]  I mean, when you ask me how ridiculous can it get, I will tell you, whatever we are right
[2:26:13.120 --> 2:26:16.840]  now, way today, it'll get even more ridiculous.
[2:26:16.840 --> 2:26:20.520]  Well I was talking about that, let me raise this to you, and I'm not going to even read
[2:26:20.520 --> 2:26:22.200]  this on air, San Francisco Chronicle.
[2:26:22.200 --> 2:26:28.400]  It talks about people cutting themselves and crapping on themselves at the official parades
[2:26:28.400 --> 2:26:32.400]  they bring children to, and how fun it is to see the naked people.
[2:26:32.400 --> 2:26:35.400]  Why is San Francisco covered in human feces?
[2:26:35.400 --> 2:26:38.040]  There's the Guardian.
[2:26:38.040 --> 2:26:42.160]  Americans flee blue states in the hundreds of thousands due to high taxes, leaving fewer
[2:26:42.160 --> 2:26:44.360]  to pay the Democrats tab.
[2:26:44.360 --> 2:26:45.360]  That's red state.
[2:26:45.360 --> 2:26:51.000]  And in fulsome street fair stresses consent, I'm in leather BDSM, and it says they will
[2:26:51.000 --> 2:26:57.120]  teach us consent and stop the Republican rapist by cutting themselves and crapping on each
[2:26:57.120 --> 2:26:58.120]  other.
[2:26:58.120 --> 2:27:02.280]  I'm not even going to read all the stuff it says here, but I mean, it's like these,
[2:27:02.280 --> 2:27:05.200]  this is what happened when we got rid of the lunatic asylums.
[2:27:05.200 --> 2:27:10.680]  Well, think about it, in New York, you have people like de Blasio, who now says it's
[2:27:10.680 --> 2:27:15.160]  no, you don't even outlaw people defecating and pissing in public.
[2:27:15.160 --> 2:27:16.760]  I mean, you can just do it right there.
[2:27:16.760 --> 2:27:20.280]  It used to be, I forget what they called it, but they had, it was a nuisance thing, and
[2:27:20.280 --> 2:27:21.280]  it was right.
[2:27:21.280 --> 2:27:22.280]  Public indecency.
[2:27:22.280 --> 2:27:23.280]  Yeah.
[2:27:23.280 --> 2:27:24.280]  So now it's no big deal.
[2:27:24.280 --> 2:27:28.080]  So they have people running around with naked paint, which, you know, look, I'm a dude,
[2:27:28.080 --> 2:27:31.640]  I've seen some of these girls, they're hot, but would you want your kids to see that?
[2:27:31.640 --> 2:27:32.800]  Well, exactly.
[2:27:32.800 --> 2:27:34.600]  That's the thing is go do it in a private place.
[2:27:34.600 --> 2:27:36.160]  Let me run around middle street.
[2:27:36.160 --> 2:27:37.160]  Right.
[2:27:37.160 --> 2:27:40.240]  I mean, in town square, you know, and the busiest places in New York.
[2:27:40.240 --> 2:27:42.280]  So this is what we're dealing with.
[2:27:42.280 --> 2:27:46.400]  They want to tell us that, you know, I look at teaching little kids how to put condoms
[2:27:46.400 --> 2:27:47.640]  on and all these other things.
[2:27:47.640 --> 2:27:48.640]  And then they get mad.
[2:27:48.640 --> 2:27:49.640]  Oh yeah.
[2:27:49.640 --> 2:27:54.120]  What about the world Boy Scout conference and they handed out 100,000 condoms even six
[2:27:54.120 --> 2:27:55.120]  year old.
[2:27:55.120 --> 2:27:56.120]  What the hell is that?
[2:27:56.120 --> 2:28:00.160]  You send your son to a Boy Scout convention and they're going to give them condoms.
[2:28:00.160 --> 2:28:01.160]  Right.
[2:28:01.160 --> 2:28:02.560]  Well, it's no longer the Boy Scouts anymore.
[2:28:02.560 --> 2:28:03.760]  It can be the any scout.
[2:28:03.760 --> 2:28:06.000]  So look, there is no limit.
[2:28:06.000 --> 2:28:10.960]  And I'm telling folks, forget about the Muslims, forget about the illegals coming over.
[2:28:10.960 --> 2:28:15.320]  The worst part of what's going on in this country right now is the leftist and the leftists
[2:28:15.320 --> 2:28:17.520]  have essentially made us shut up.
[2:28:17.520 --> 2:28:18.520]  They don't, we don't agree.
[2:28:18.520 --> 2:28:21.480]  You're saying the leftist are, they're the number one threat.
[2:28:21.480 --> 2:28:22.960]  They are the threat.
[2:28:22.960 --> 2:28:23.960]  Yeah.
[2:28:23.960 --> 2:28:24.960]  They are the threat.
[2:28:24.960 --> 2:28:29.320]  These are the people that have been training us for decades how to shut our mouths, grin
[2:28:29.320 --> 2:28:33.480]  and bear it, take what they want to put, push to us, whatever that agenda is.
[2:28:33.480 --> 2:28:34.480]  And we gladly capitulate.
[2:28:34.480 --> 2:28:35.480]  Well, you know what?
[2:28:35.480 --> 2:28:36.480]  It's time we stand up.
[2:28:36.480 --> 2:28:37.480]  Yeah.
[2:28:37.480 --> 2:28:40.800]  Cause now they're got all the big companies organized to censor everybody and they used
[2:28:40.800 --> 2:28:42.880]  me as the first domino and now it's everybody else.
[2:28:42.880 --> 2:28:47.320]  We'll come back then and get into cabin on and ask our guests, how does, how does he
[2:28:47.320 --> 2:28:48.760]  think we win this?
[2:28:48.760 --> 2:28:51.880]  Because I have children, he's got children.
[2:28:51.880 --> 2:28:52.880]  How do we deal with this?
[2:28:52.880 --> 2:28:55.240]  The answer is we're on a backbone.

[2:33:43.800 --> 2:33:52.000]  doctor for who he called these women skanks they all look like a bunch of crazy bug-eyed

[2:34:10.560 --> 2:34:15.720]  Kit Daniels has written about it the former current prosecutor that grilled her lists
[2:34:15.720 --> 2:34:22.120]  a whole big raft of things where she totally has changed her story and then you've got
[2:34:22.120 --> 2:34:26.800]  all the other fake stories that have come out on what's happening on boats all the rest
[2:34:26.800 --> 2:34:36.280]  of it show we got more bad news White House authorizes FBI to expand Kavanaugh report
[2:34:36.280 --> 2:34:41.160]  so White House of money reportedly prevented the FBI to interview anyone deemed appropriate
[2:34:41.160 --> 2:34:45.280]  in its investigation the sexual misconduct allegations in Supreme Court not only Brett
[2:34:45.280 --> 2:34:50.960]  Kavanaugh amid security that the administration was limiting the scope so she wants the witch
[2:34:50.960 --> 2:34:56.160]  hunt starts everybody's a Russian except Hillary in bed with the Russians Lindsey Graham vows
[2:34:56.160 --> 2:35:01.800]  full-scale probe into Dems handling of four Kavanaugh allegations a hashtag kill Kavanaugh
[2:35:01.800 --> 2:35:07.160]  tops list of Twitter hashtags House could investigate Kavanaugh he's confirmed Nadler
[2:35:07.160 --> 2:35:12.120]  says I mean you knew you just you just fed the lions there folks they're just gonna get
[2:35:12.120 --> 2:35:20.440]  more hungry now meanwhile you've got the anti-fascine kill teams need to kill the conservative leadership
[2:35:20.440 --> 2:35:27.200]  that dovetails with the hashtag kill Kavanaugh show here's the prosecutor Rachel Mitchell
[2:35:27.200 --> 2:35:33.600]  highlights massive inconsistencies in Christine force testimony that articles up on info wars.com
[2:35:33.600 --> 2:35:40.440]  but that doesn't matter because all these politicians these Republican cowards other
[2:35:40.440 --> 2:35:49.680]  than people like Rand Paul and Lindsey Graham and Donald Trump on this issue all the others
[2:35:49.680 --> 2:35:56.560]  just want a virtue signal and they all want to play it safe so if Kavanaugh doesn't get
[2:35:56.560 --> 2:36:01.240]  confirmed well let's just get your take on Kavanaugh in general again you got banned
[2:36:01.240 --> 2:36:05.000]  off Fox News as a contributor you got fired for saying you don't believe these women how
[2:36:05.000 --> 2:36:10.000]  dare you have an opinion even though none of the witnesses say these women's stories are
[2:36:10.000 --> 2:36:16.000]  true these women are lying through their teeth and let me tell you if you watch excuse me
[2:36:16.000 --> 2:36:20.240]  if you've seen a if anybody in your family's ever been a victim of sexual abuse in any
[2:36:20.240 --> 2:36:26.840]  way a friend and you watch that testimony of lying forward I call it the Ford farce
[2:36:26.840 --> 2:36:30.960]  then you know she's lying you nobody talks about well how do you know that that was the
[2:36:30.960 --> 2:36:35.600]  guy and you start talking about epinephrine and your hippocampus and stuff like that you
[2:36:35.600 --> 2:36:40.280]  say I'll never forget those eyes I'll never forget that breath I'll never forget the pressure
[2:36:40.280 --> 2:36:44.600]  that he put on me as he was doing this or that you start talking about the things that
[2:36:44.600 --> 2:36:49.240]  physically happen you don't talk about neopreneprin and all these other crappy things he's talking
[2:36:49.240 --> 2:36:53.840]  about that was with somebody describing what somebody said to her and she's trying to explain
[2:36:53.840 --> 2:36:58.360]  to you what was going on in your brain look at that's exactly true because the things
[2:36:58.360 --> 2:37:01.840]  that were done to me though a few times I got mugged or one time some guy for no reason
[2:37:01.840 --> 2:37:06.440]  at a party grabbed me in the kitchen put a knife my throat I remember him snarling at
[2:37:06.440 --> 2:37:09.800]  me telling me he was gonna kill me and the way he smelled in his cologne I could still
[2:37:09.800 --> 2:37:16.400]  smell it I didn't talk about my hippocampus right and you know what the defense is well
[2:37:16.400 --> 2:37:20.000]  she's a psychologist I mean that's what she's gonna go to I don't care who you are there's
[2:37:20.000 --> 2:37:25.040]  a human factor in fear and you don't talk about it the way and she didn't remember how
[2:37:25.040 --> 2:37:29.560]  she got there how she left but then the couches and the mute she remembered everything but
[2:37:29.560 --> 2:37:36.280]  witnesses yeah look Alex again I'm not even gonna for me it's it's nonsense even to get
[2:37:36.280 --> 2:37:42.520]  into the details of what she said she's lying and 36 years all the witnesses say the opposite
[2:37:42.520 --> 2:37:47.960]  it's political she's a huge Hillary worshiper who is the recruitment officer at her college
[2:37:47.960 --> 2:37:53.640]  for the CIA yeah connect the dots with everybody involved in this case from the attorneys how
[2:37:53.640 --> 2:37:58.400]  Feinstein leaked it how they got to all the information leading up to say in Kavanaugh's
[2:37:58.400 --> 2:38:02.760]  this guy and then ask yourself this about Kavanaugh you we've all gone to college gone
[2:38:02.760 --> 2:38:06.520]  to high school with guys gone to college why is there no history of this dude that he just
[2:38:06.520 --> 2:38:12.800]  suddenly in the pathology of being a serial rapist or did he never was he never it so
[2:38:12.800 --> 2:38:17.240]  for me if we buy into this and allow ourselves to keep asking ourselves questions about this
[2:38:17.240 --> 2:38:22.600]  we buy into their farce and so the only thing we can do is what I did which is to fight back
[2:38:22.600 --> 2:38:27.480]  to call her what she is to call women like her what they are I have a my sister one
[2:38:27.480 --> 2:38:32.680]  time told me about a girlfriend who borrowed my sister's pregnant pregnancy test where she
[2:38:32.680 --> 2:38:37.080]  tested positive so she could go to ford dude she was having sex with to get money for an
[2:38:37.080 --> 2:38:41.720]  abortion now that's the kind of skanky stuff that women do that people don't want to talk
[2:38:41.720 --> 2:38:47.880]  about Alex everybody any guy over the age of 25 years old that any guy that's been been
[2:38:47.880 --> 2:38:52.200]  out with a lot of women knows about gold diggers and skanks you better believe they do and
[2:38:52.200 --> 2:38:56.880]  when they asked Snoop Dogg about you know and I'll just say B's and H's he said and
[2:38:56.880 --> 2:39:00.000]  they ask him would you want your daughter to be called that he says no but don't tell
[2:39:00.000 --> 2:39:05.360]  me that I don't know what a B or an H is because I'm around them so look we can pretend that
[2:39:05.360 --> 2:39:09.120]  we that the lexicon hurts our feelings and stuff like that the left weren't their feelings
[2:39:09.120 --> 2:39:14.600]  weren't hurt with what I said they women in in the left call you ever watch rich housewise
[2:39:14.600 --> 2:39:19.120]  of anywhere they call themselves stuff that's far worse than anything I've ever said and
[2:39:19.120 --> 2:39:23.880]  certainly far worse than example Rosie O'Donnell came out and called in there's no proof of
[2:39:23.880 --> 2:39:29.360]  it Lindsey Graham you know you closeted all these names and the left all praises it it's
[2:39:29.360 --> 2:39:33.480]  like another mean lesbian and I'm not against women like women the point is is that she
[2:39:33.480 --> 2:39:38.600]  just the stereotypical mean lesbian but why is the left why is the left allowed to like
[2:39:38.600 --> 2:39:42.280]  you said white people call black people the n-word and to the left it's okay it's just
[2:39:42.280 --> 2:39:48.640]  sick it is sick but again we allow it because we aren't fighting back and and I look how
[2:39:48.640 --> 2:39:53.240]  many people do you know Alex honest to God who talk to talk but don't walk the walk these
[2:39:53.240 --> 2:39:57.160]  are people that say yeah man I'm in the fight and then you say okay here's what the fight
[2:39:57.160 --> 2:40:01.320]  requires it requires you to donate it requires you to press you know I know a bunch of talk
[2:40:01.320 --> 2:40:05.880]  show hosts that beg to come on the show and as soon as I got banned everywhere they thought
[2:40:05.880 --> 2:40:10.240]  oh I can't come on your show I might get banned which if which it doesn't hurt I don't need
[2:40:10.240 --> 2:40:16.040]  them for the show that they're such cowards it is what hurts me let me say something
[2:40:16.040 --> 2:40:22.320]  about that you're the first TV broadcast that I've done and I got asked by a lot of people
[2:40:22.320 --> 2:40:26.600]  to come on I did no media after that because they were all like Kevin come on and tell
[2:40:26.600 --> 2:40:31.680]  your story to bash Fox but it was funny I said the first show I want to do and it turned
[2:40:31.680 --> 2:40:35.960]  out that your producer contacted me I said I want to do Alex Jones because I couldn't
[2:40:35.960 --> 2:40:40.680]  do that show before I want people to understand that I'm not afraid to go on and have people
[2:40:40.680 --> 2:40:46.080]  go oh there's Kevin on Alex Jones bring it you know look my story is my story it'll be
[2:40:46.080 --> 2:40:51.840]  the same wherever I go but I wanted to make it your show for this reason exact and again
[2:40:51.840 --> 2:40:55.400]  they build strawmen about me that aren't true then tell everybody not come on the show just
[2:40:55.400 --> 2:40:58.720]  like they'll build strawmen about you but even though I was Charlie Manson you're allowed
[2:40:58.720 --> 2:41:03.120]  to go on what shows you want they even threaten people don't interview Jones or will ban you
[2:41:03.120 --> 2:41:08.320]  because he's so bad well wait I mean the Ayatollah Khomeini was interviewed by 60 minutes what
[2:41:08.320 --> 2:41:12.760]  is this new thing where you better not talk to somebody because they want to build a strawman
[2:41:12.760 --> 2:41:16.560]  and lie about what I said and not have you hear the real one that's why I hate being
[2:41:16.560 --> 2:41:21.800]  censored it's not that I'm not on those platforms it's that now that I'm not on those platforms
[2:41:21.800 --> 2:41:28.240]  they can tell the most outrageous crazy lies and I can't respond but here's the good news
[2:41:28.240 --> 2:41:33.640]  and I think from my perspective and possibly for yours as well people know who I am they
[2:41:33.640 --> 2:41:39.120]  say you know Kevin's a principled guy I didn't I didn't go try to hammer Fox after they let
[2:41:39.120 --> 2:41:43.080]  me go they that's their prerogative do what they want to do but I plan on making myself
[2:41:43.080 --> 2:41:47.400]  bigger than anything they possibly thought I could be and that's going to be our revenge
[2:41:47.400 --> 2:41:51.960]  Alex in the long run is we will put these dudes we were going to put their lights out
[2:41:51.960 --> 2:41:57.560]  I don't know how but I know we have the capability I totally agree I want you to come back home

[3:02:56.640 --> 3:03:02.560]  what are you bababooey we're doing it you know how many people watch this show i didn't know
[3:03:02.560 --> 3:03:06.160]  bababooey did that but no i just uh how did you not know bababooey did that that's how they joke
[3:03:06.160 --> 3:03:14.080]  about him all the time they go i did hear that yeah but uh just ate something weird you had a hotdog
[3:03:14.080 --> 3:03:18.320]  i was with you for lunch what's weird about a hotdog it's the most normal food available i wasn't
[3:03:18.320 --> 3:03:24.000]  trying to next to an apple what are the most normal foods on earth a hamburger a hotdog an apple
[3:03:25.280 --> 3:03:30.720]  stick a gum i mean or that's basically the top five you had one of these exotic hot dogs i think
[3:03:30.720 --> 3:03:37.600]  the bun was it the sriracha did you have sriracha i did so you're a wimp you can't handle spicy sauce
[3:03:37.600 --> 3:03:43.440]  even though you're half porto rican i want all the porto rican's watching the show to recognize
[3:03:43.440 --> 3:03:47.600]  that they are dealing with a porto rican man who can't handle spice i believe that's like a
[3:03:47.600 --> 3:03:51.840]  scotsman who can't handle his whiskey you're going to be excommunicated you have to move over to 100
[3:03:51.840 --> 3:03:57.360]  percent to the japanese side i hope not you know what i would do if i were you i would find another
[3:03:57.360 --> 3:04:02.880]  japanese porto rican guy and you guys run at each other at about 100 miles an hour until you
[3:04:02.880 --> 3:04:07.200]  smash and then there's a japanese guy and a porto rican guy physically do you think that's possible
[3:04:07.200 --> 3:04:12.720]  i believe that's the way the atoms would work well as a mathematician half i'd say that that's
[3:04:12.720 --> 3:04:18.480]  impossible oh wow you are half japanese turning japanese i think he's turning japanese i really
[3:04:18.480 --> 3:04:24.400]  think so i don't know that song's banned now um so yeah that was a fascinating miscarriage of
[3:04:24.400 --> 3:04:29.200]  justice it's fascinating going down there and seeing the vitriol that the middle class the
[3:04:29.200 --> 3:04:36.080]  media class gets from uh that has towards the working class like we see it here too right we
[3:04:36.080 --> 3:04:40.880]  have steven cobert and and all the late night guests and they you can tell they have nothing
[3:04:40.880 --> 3:04:45.520]  but contempt for the plumbers and electricians and the tradesmen of america the trump people in
[3:04:45.520 --> 3:04:52.000]  america but uh there it's much more deep seated and much more vitriol back in a moment

[3:06:42.560 --> 3:06:48.320]  sneakers the shaved head hardcore is american punk and what they did was they stripped it down

[3:08:27.920 --> 3:08:33.600]  just say maybe it was me could be psychosomatic didn't do nothing for me but i have a feeling
[3:08:33.600 --> 3:08:38.000]  it will do something because i'm very sensitive to drugs that's why i can't smoke pot anymore
[3:08:38.000 --> 3:08:44.640]  it's too intense my god have you tried what the kids are smoking these days i don't know how alex
[3:08:44.640 --> 3:08:52.160]  jones survived on joe rogan man last time i tried marajuana i had i was like a narc i had to lie
[3:08:52.160 --> 3:08:57.680]  down on a cold cement floor shirtless and the only reason i didn't call 911 is because the idea of
[3:08:57.680 --> 3:09:02.960]  being in a gurney and going down the elevator and getting i was at work at the time and being like
[3:09:02.960 --> 3:09:07.920]  put on an ambulance which just sounded like too much to bear but if i was at a hospital i definitely
[3:09:07.920 --> 3:09:12.080]  would have buzzed the buzzer you know that thing they have in the restroom where you can push it
[3:09:12.080 --> 3:09:18.800]  if you faint anyway enough blethering machinists let's have some substance on the show did anyone
[3:09:18.800 --> 3:09:29.840]  else see 60 minutes last night what a mess it was a perfect example of geriatric boomer propaganda
[3:09:29.840 --> 3:09:36.080]  i turned into the boss here at info wars alex jones i got real conspiratorial towards the end
[3:09:36.080 --> 3:09:40.720]  and it was everything that's wrong with modern media it's everything that's wrong with paid media
[3:09:40.720 --> 3:09:44.880]  and you have to understand when you see an establishment news show like 60 minutes
[3:09:44.880 --> 3:09:51.920]  you are watching propaganda and what's worse i don't believe these journalists care i think
[3:09:52.640 --> 3:09:56.480]  you see this with talk show hosts too you get to a certain national on your career like howard
[3:09:56.480 --> 3:10:02.160]  stern and you're good for money and you've already made your mark in society you've already you already
[3:10:02.160 --> 3:10:07.600]  cut your teeth cut your chops you've already already made your mark and so what they really care
[3:10:07.600 --> 3:10:10.880]  about at that point in their career is dinner parties i want to go to the right dinner parties i
[3:10:10.880 --> 3:10:16.800]  want the show to continue i want to help out with fundraising get more money in and stuff i got two
[3:10:16.800 --> 3:10:21.040]  divorces i gotta pay for i want to get the money in i don't want to i don't want to anger any
[3:10:21.040 --> 3:10:25.440]  advertisers and i just really want to go to the hamptons i really want to go to this party at
[3:10:25.440 --> 3:10:31.280]  the hamptons this is the top one the less moonves one i guess and then i oh my wife also wants to
[3:10:31.280 --> 3:10:36.480]  go to this one and this one that's their priorities and you see it so clearly in the news there's no
[3:10:36.480 --> 3:10:43.840]  no ambition there's no curiosity it's it's not thorough so i'm kind of obsessed with the opioid
[3:10:43.840 --> 3:10:47.600]  crisis and i think it's amazing we don't hear about it and i know why we don't hear about it
[3:10:47.600 --> 3:10:52.720]  because inevitably when you're watching right and left news by the way fox news or cnn they cut to
[3:10:52.720 --> 3:11:00.960]  a commercial and they say ask your doctor about xyleflex side effects include diarrhea dizziness
[3:11:00.960 --> 3:11:08.240]  basically the side effects are the same as going on a four-day coke and heroin booze bender dizziness
[3:11:08.240 --> 3:11:14.880]  diarrhea headaches nausea sounds like you got a little too wasted that weekend and i think they
[3:11:14.880 --> 3:11:20.560]  don't report on big pharma because they don't want to lose big advertisers and a lot of these
[3:11:20.560 --> 3:11:26.080]  stations especially fox news it seems like their only advertiser is is pharmaceutical companies
[3:11:26.080 --> 3:11:32.400]  anyway so they go we're going to tackle the opioid crisis and you go well that's amazing 60
[3:11:32.400 --> 3:11:36.720]  minutes i thought you guys were a bunch of geriatric liberal dinosaurs you're actually
[3:11:36.720 --> 3:11:43.520]  going to do some real reporting and talk about the 40 000 people a year who die of opioid overdoses
[3:11:43.520 --> 3:11:50.000]  115 a day so it starts out they have the black guy doing it okay and it's produced by ira rosen
[3:11:50.000 --> 3:11:58.080]  ira rosen ira rosen what i mean anyway uh he says you know more people died last year from opioid
[3:11:58.080 --> 3:12:02.960]  addiction then they died in vietnam that's one of the opening lines now i don't want to trivialize
[3:12:02.960 --> 3:12:09.600]  opioid addiction but a wrong fact is a wrong fact there's no alternative facts and 60 000 guys died
[3:12:09.600 --> 3:12:17.920]  in vietnam not 40 000 so you're already off from the wrong foot but anyway i'm watching it and we
[3:12:17.920 --> 3:12:25.120]  all know the real story right with the oxy problem we've got one guy the slacker what's the name
[3:12:25.120 --> 3:12:31.200]  richard slacker the slacker family one family getting the lion's share the profits from this
[3:12:31.200 --> 3:12:37.760]  addiction and they are Purdue pharmaceuticals and they gave doctors financial incentives to
[3:12:37.760 --> 3:12:43.920]  over prescribe oxy cotton now i don't know if you've ever done heroin but let me just explain
[3:12:43.920 --> 3:12:53.360]  if you did a large booger of heroin right like uh say like take your smallest tooth and divide that
[3:12:53.360 --> 3:12:58.720]  by four that's a terrible enough why did i get so bad in analogies i used to be the analogy king
[3:12:59.680 --> 3:13:05.760]  maybe like uh did i say sackler oh sorry sackler sackler all right how about this a
[3:13:05.760 --> 3:13:11.360]  diamond earring a little tiny stud diamond earring say you did that much heroin just snorted it
[3:13:11.360 --> 3:13:16.720]  you would be projectile vomiting your guts out which wouldn't feel bad because you're in heroin
[3:13:16.720 --> 3:13:25.200]  and then you would be dead to the world for about five hours four hours you just be like
[3:13:25.440 --> 3:13:31.840]  hey man well that'd be like you were shot with a tranquilizer dart now one of these oxy pills
[3:13:31.840 --> 3:13:37.920]  is about 10 times the dosage of that and these doctors were prescribing up to 60 a day there
[3:13:37.920 --> 3:13:43.760]  is no way you could do 60 pills a day and not die i don't care how higher give them to a junkie in
[3:13:43.760 --> 3:13:52.080]  the lower east side and he would od that is a death sentence anyway um so is it richard sackler
[3:13:52.720 --> 3:13:58.240]  richard sackler Purdue pharmaceuticals not only do they make oxy and incentivize doctors to
[3:13:58.240 --> 3:14:03.680]  over prescribe but their defense is we're just one there's tons of people making this there's
[3:14:03.680 --> 3:14:09.120]  all these generics out there and then we find out oh you're making the generics too interesting
[3:14:09.120 --> 3:14:15.040]  but it gets worse they are also they also are pushing for the patent for the trademark for
[3:14:15.040 --> 3:14:23.200]  the opioid blocker now how Superman 3 can we get you are creating the addiction and you're also
[3:14:23.760 --> 3:14:31.040]  trademarking the cure not the band the way to stop being an opioid addict to stop being a junkie
[3:14:31.040 --> 3:14:35.200]  isn't that every comic book you've ever read oh they're going to make the whole world addicted
[3:14:35.200 --> 3:14:40.000]  and then they're going to get a cure and there but the ones with the cure it's his real life
[3:14:40.000 --> 3:14:49.840]  villainry and 60 minutes decides to totally ignore all of that no sackler no Purdue no generic no
[3:14:49.840 --> 3:14:55.840]  trademarking the cure none of that is in it at all so what they do is they talk about this other
[3:14:55.840 --> 3:15:00.640]  company that was making them and then make the other company look bad not that bad sorry to make
[3:15:00.640 --> 3:15:05.040]  pretty good the the company just goes we're sorry we were just doing it but we were just making it
[3:15:05.040 --> 3:15:09.280]  we didn't give it to people we're just a pharmaceutical company so not only are you not
[3:15:09.280 --> 3:15:14.240]  putting Purdue in but you're making pharmaceutical companies look innocent and the the guy in the
[3:15:14.240 --> 3:15:19.200]  forefront story was this Dr. Schmidt or something like that and he was way over the top he's looking
[3:15:19.200 --> 3:15:25.040]  at a life sentence um he was the guy given the 60 pills a day but he was making I think 6,000 a day
[3:15:25.040 --> 3:15:30.720]  describing so they put it all on him so now your brain if you're not curious if you're one of the
[3:15:30.720 --> 3:15:35.920]  many in curious 60 minutes watchers you go oh I see what the opioid epidemic is nothing to do
[3:15:35.920 --> 3:15:44.320]  with the sacklers it's uh corrupt doctors greedy doctors killing people done now when we come back
[3:15:44.880 --> 3:15:51.440]  I will explain why I think 60 minutes took this angle and it is remarkably sinister

[3:21:30.880 --> 3:21:36.720]  take these because my vocabulary will be so much better methylcobalamin methylcobalamin
[3:21:36.720 --> 3:21:43.440]  or methylated b12 is the selective coenzyme form of b12 used in secret 12 and when paired with
[3:21:43.440 --> 3:21:51.360]  adencycobalamin the other coenzyme form of b12 forms the key blend that makes secret 12 so
[3:21:51.360 --> 3:21:55.200]  special i remember an colter saying when she does the auto versions of her book she could just
[3:21:55.200 --> 3:22:00.880]  race through it because she wrote the book but she goes i get stuck on these muslim names for
[3:22:00.880 --> 3:22:08.240]  half the things so i'd be saying and of course after the arrests of muhammad mac mashabas mal
[3:22:08.240 --> 3:22:15.280]  a year malal it's like this guy the muhammad video and then of course they arrested nasula
[3:22:15.280 --> 3:22:22.080]  backley nasula who if your name's backley nasula why wouldn't your dad name you nasula

[3:23:01.120 --> 3:23:06.080]  of liberals scoff at all of these products and say it's some crazy pill doesn't even work
[3:23:07.840 --> 3:23:12.960]  crazy town i know famous people in hollywood and before trump i hung out with them before i was
[3:23:12.960 --> 3:23:19.520]  dumped they're all taking b12 they're all injecting it it's that it was the hot thing this was b16 i
[3:23:19.520 --> 3:23:24.720]  guess before trump was elected but i even tried it and i thought isn't it weird how trusting i am
[3:23:24.720 --> 3:23:30.640]  that i'm letting this celebrity inject me with a syringe this could be poison for all i know and
[3:23:30.640 --> 3:23:34.720]  then they dumped me because of trump but i'm like i trusted you with my life you could have given me
[3:23:34.720 --> 3:23:42.320]  aids and now you don't trust me anyway that's uh neither here nor there um later on i want to talk
[3:23:42.320 --> 3:23:48.080]  about this footage that uh that you guys got with owens shrier and some black guy saying america was
[3:23:48.080 --> 3:23:54.000]  never great i can't wait to see that footage it was just that argument is so tedious you know what
[3:23:54.000 --> 3:23:59.120]  they mean when they say that america was never great they mean america was never perfect great
[3:23:59.120 --> 3:24:05.120]  is a relative term and america was always the great test yes we had slavery we were late to the
[3:24:05.120 --> 3:24:10.320]  slavery game it was a terrible horrible thing and we lost 620 000 men fighting over that
[3:24:11.680 --> 3:24:16.880]  but that's the worst to guess go compare america to every other country at any time in history and
[3:24:16.880 --> 3:24:21.600]  you know what you'll see greatness and by the way when trump says he wants to make america great
[3:24:21.600 --> 3:24:29.600]  again he doesn't mean slavery he means the 80s he means mullets he means jet skis he means chicks
[3:24:29.600 --> 3:24:34.960]  and bikinis that say budweiser on them and those big sort of puffy white weightlifter socks they
[3:24:34.960 --> 3:24:38.640]  used to wear with their keds remember those days you had no idea if they had cancels or not because
[3:24:38.640 --> 3:24:45.520]  you couldn't see their ankles anyway i gotta get back to my ounce jones uh theory here so everything
[3:24:45.520 --> 3:24:51.920]  i told you what 60 minutes and their opioid segment was totally factual right from now on
[3:24:51.920 --> 3:24:58.320]  from from this part of the show going forward this is all my personal theory these are not facts
[3:24:58.320 --> 3:25:03.600]  these are things i believe to be true here's what i believe happened ira rosen is the producer of that
[3:25:03.600 --> 3:25:09.280]  opioid segment he's also the guy that did the fluff piece on 60 minutes about the nsa remember that
[3:25:09.280 --> 3:25:15.040]  i think it was a couple years ago and it was a government sponsored 60 minutes piece about guess
[3:25:15.040 --> 3:25:20.560]  what how wonderful the government is and how awesome the nsa are and how hard they're working
[3:25:20.560 --> 3:25:25.440]  for our safety and how they never invade anyone's private conversation oh no and they show us on
[3:25:25.440 --> 3:25:31.920]  their computers how they never go near anything private and 60 minutes had no other angle whatsoever
[3:25:31.920 --> 3:25:36.400]  it was just nsa is awesome and that was clearly the government saying look we'll give you unfettered
[3:25:37.280 --> 3:25:42.800]  access to our stuff also i suspect some other benefit like financial or maybe tax breaks or
[3:25:42.800 --> 3:25:48.640]  maybe we won't we won't include you in this you know media parameter who knows what the kickbacks
[3:25:48.640 --> 3:25:53.280]  were for that segment but it was nothing but Stalinist propaganda all right so if established
[3:25:53.280 --> 3:25:58.160]  it i should have said this part is factual too i haven't got to the theory yet so that's ira rosen
[3:25:58.160 --> 3:26:05.120]  doing propaganda on behalf of the government what if the sakler or some institution they're big
[3:26:05.120 --> 3:26:10.160]  philanthropists they they run the met here in new york and moma and all the it's clearly the women
[3:26:10.160 --> 3:26:14.720]  right the wives and the daughters they go i don't want to do the pharmaceutical stuff i want to like
[3:26:14.720 --> 3:26:19.840]  pay for paintings okay you run moma and sweetheart you run the met okay i love that i love her
[3:26:21.840 --> 3:26:26.800]  so they're good at philanthropy so they have these organizations like open foundation like
[3:26:26.800 --> 3:26:34.080]  soros has and there's a foundation and foundation so i'm assuming there was a sakler perdu pharmaceutical
[3:26:34.080 --> 3:26:41.280]  linked benefit charity whatever company that went to cbs and said look we got to discuss
[3:26:41.280 --> 3:26:47.040]  this opioid crisis and i want to help you i want to help you either financially or invite everyone
[3:26:47.040 --> 3:26:51.680]  to the cool dinner party something's in it for 60 minutes i don't know what let's say 10 million
[3:26:51.680 --> 3:26:58.160]  dollars right and cbs likes that because it keeps 60 minutes afloat for another year and these dinosaur
[3:26:58.160 --> 3:27:03.040]  producers and don't care right and so they say we want to give you money we want to contribute
[3:27:03.040 --> 3:27:08.160]  to 60 minutes but obviously it would be very bad if perdu pharmaceuticals looked bad in this segment
[3:27:08.160 --> 3:27:12.640]  because we're totally innocent and the sakler family is behind this donation and it would be
[3:27:13.280 --> 3:27:19.120]  counterintuitive it would be detrimental for them to be paying for someone to then
[3:27:19.120 --> 3:27:23.920]  desecrate them and criticize them and and of course they would sue we would sue you for that
[3:27:23.920 --> 3:27:27.920]  so we'd be suing you for using our money and then of course it would get out that you took our money
[3:27:27.920 --> 3:27:34.480]  so make it about the doctors don't mention sakler's ones and don't mention perdu pharmaceuticals
[3:27:34.480 --> 3:27:39.680]  ones and we want to obfuscate the whole opioid crisis and put it all on this one corrupt doctor
[3:27:39.680 --> 3:27:46.720]  and say he's killed all 40 000 people a year doesn't it smell like that i've already established
[3:27:46.720 --> 3:27:52.240]  that that 60 minutes has done propaganda in the past and it was the same producer on both pieces
[3:27:52.240 --> 3:28:01.280]  is that at the very least is that not remarkably suspicious and it is a perfect example of what
[3:28:01.280 --> 3:28:08.560]  the mainstream media has become they are not news they are publicists it's one big gigantic
[3:28:08.560 --> 3:28:16.160]  pr firm and this pr firm has decided that big pharma is always right and trump is always wrong
[3:28:16.160 --> 3:28:21.600]  so when you turn on the news please know and this includes me by the way please know that
[3:28:21.600 --> 3:28:25.200]  you're not watching organic matter that just naturally bubbled up from the top and some
[3:28:25.200 --> 3:28:30.400]  curious people with little pressed badges in their fedora went in there taking notes
[3:28:30.400 --> 3:28:34.720]  what you're watching was bought and paid for by someone with a lot of money and at the very
[3:28:34.720 --> 3:28:39.120]  least when you read it you should read it as a homework assignment i know it's a pain in the
[3:28:39.120 --> 3:28:42.880]  ass you already finished school we still have nightmares about showing up with our pants down

[3:31:51.760 --> 3:31:58.560]  alpha power today living in volcano may sound more dramatic than it really is the real drama
[3:31:58.560 --> 3:32:04.080]  can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island rely on rainwater and we
[3:32:04.080 --> 3:32:10.160]  need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain heavy metal particles
[3:32:10.720 --> 3:32:16.640]  and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out we employed a series
[3:32:16.640 --> 3:32:23.440]  of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there was in fact unhealthy
[3:32:23.440 --> 3:32:28.640]  levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water from our
[3:32:28.640 --> 3:32:35.120]  elixir pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure but the ph
[3:32:35.120 --> 3:32:42.160]  was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the elixir pure raises the ph of
[3:32:42.160 --> 3:32:48.800]  the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rainwater supply
[3:32:48.800 --> 3:32:59.840]  but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:33:19.280 --> 3:33:19.840]  is
[3:33:25.440 --> 3:33:30.400]  crashing through the lies and disinformation it's alex jones
[3:33:34.560 --> 3:33:42.960]  i believe that was cake in the mid 90s not my cup of tea the mid 90s is kind of a bad time for
[3:33:42.960 --> 3:33:50.240]  music wasn't it lion i don't like grunge i i love that kind of stuff like the um bob dillon sun
[3:33:51.360 --> 3:33:57.600]  uh the wall flowers one headlight the verb yeah even nirvana i remember they came to montreal
[3:33:57.600 --> 3:34:03.120]  and they uh smells like teen spirit had just hit like that day so we knew them as the guys who did
[3:34:03.120 --> 3:34:08.480]  bleach and they had one hit negative creep and they wanted 20 a ticket and they went 20 for the
[3:34:08.480 --> 3:34:15.200]  negative creep guys who just do like sludge rock like that's going anywhere no thanks flashing the
[3:34:15.200 --> 3:34:22.720]  band curd go bang um all right so that's enough about 60 minutes fishy stuff going on there and
[3:34:22.720 --> 3:34:27.760]  i think it's amazing that these journalists they they nitpick a bunch of irrelevant crap and they
[3:34:27.760 --> 3:34:34.640]  put stuff on the news that has no bearing on reality yet who doesn't know a bartender's son a
[3:34:34.640 --> 3:34:43.040]  fireman's kid a housewife a guy in finance some 15 year old some 68 year old some farmer
[3:34:43.040 --> 3:34:49.440]  who recently odied on opioids i everyone i talk to if they don't know someone intimately who just
[3:34:49.440 --> 3:34:54.560]  odied they know someone who who has a family member or is severely addicted to opioids people
[3:34:54.560 --> 3:35:01.360]  i work with the crew here it's disturbing and it's strange what dominates the news and think it's
[3:35:01.360 --> 3:35:06.080]  because the media are incurious they're lazy like in when we were in london right there's this
[3:35:06.080 --> 3:35:11.920]  melanie shaw please look her up curious folks she seems to be about to blow the whistle on deep
[3:35:11.920 --> 3:35:17.120]  seated pedophile problems not with muslims but with the top brass in the british government
[3:35:17.920 --> 3:35:23.440]  she's talking about politicians judges all diddling kids guess where she is right now
[3:35:23.440 --> 3:35:32.080]  she's in a mental institution so drugged up on xanax or whatever that she's just going what is
[3:35:32.080 --> 3:35:38.080]  not a strange coincidence that the woman who can expose the state has just been put in a mental
[3:35:38.080 --> 3:35:44.720]  institution by the same state and is unable to speak what are the odds so she's someone
[3:35:44.720 --> 3:35:49.200]  i've been trying to research but it's really difficult to get information on her and and
[3:35:49.200 --> 3:35:53.520]  the reason i bring her up is because we're at the court case the old bailey in london on thursday
[3:35:53.520 --> 3:35:58.720]  and what are the two biggest obsessions with the press one we think that tommy committed contempt
[3:35:58.720 --> 3:36:04.560]  of court yeah he was in the hole for 10 weeks the longest you're allowed to put any human being in
[3:36:04.560 --> 3:36:11.520]  solitary is 14 days he was there for 10 weeks for contempt of court which is jaywalking farting in
[3:36:11.520 --> 3:36:16.960]  court really loud when the judge gives a verdict is contempt of court would you do you think you
[3:36:16.960 --> 3:36:22.240]  should serve to be in an eight foot by eight foot cage for 10 weeks for farting that's basically
[3:36:22.240 --> 3:36:27.760]  what happened second takeaway from the press when we were there is relevant of rebel media i'm sure
[3:36:27.760 --> 3:36:32.640]  you know him friend of mine he took a video inside the court well it wasn't quite inside the court
[3:36:32.640 --> 3:36:36.800]  he's near the cafeteria but that's technically illegal so isn't that contempt of court he should
[3:36:36.800 --> 3:36:41.280]  be fine too they're running around like a bunch of little tattletales meanwhile we have these major
[3:36:41.280 --> 3:36:46.880]  stories going on that they ignore and the same is of course true right here with dr blazy ford
[3:36:46.880 --> 3:36:54.000]  what is going on with her cia ties now this is one of those stories where you read both sides
[3:36:54.640 --> 3:37:01.360]  and they don't sound that different so our side the right is saying her brother worked for the cia
[3:37:01.360 --> 3:37:06.160]  her brother-in-law worked for the cia or dad cia or grandfather cia they say that i can't remember
[3:37:06.160 --> 3:37:09.760]  which word it was it the brother the brother-in-law worked for the same company that started up fusion
[3:37:09.760 --> 3:37:14.960]  gps and they are the ones who sent sent that stupid russian dossier she go okay i want to stay
[3:37:14.960 --> 3:37:18.960]  open minded homework assignment right so then you go to media matters and you say what's their side and
[3:37:18.960 --> 3:37:26.720]  they go uh yeah he did work there but they started fusion gps after he left that's the best defense
[3:37:26.720 --> 3:37:32.960]  you got that he didn't happen to be there that day that's pretty bad oh and of course they don't say
[3:37:32.960 --> 3:37:38.400]  sent the russian dossier they say that was the company involved in the russian investigation
[3:37:38.400 --> 3:37:45.680]  so i haven't seen the left refute these allegations not in any substantial way it does seem awfully
[3:37:45.680 --> 3:37:50.160]  bizarre that this woman is so closely linked to the cia that's the article i'm talking about
[3:37:50.160 --> 3:37:55.440]  you read that media matters one and you go are you for the defense or the prosecution because
[3:37:55.440 --> 3:38:00.320]  you're not really making ford look very good but other fun gossip that's coming out about this woman
[3:38:00.320 --> 3:38:06.080]  is that she may have perjured herself you want to get into net pic net nitpicking okay how about
[3:38:06.080 --> 3:38:11.520]  that she swarmed her oath that she's a psychologist when she's not and chadwick more over at dangerous.com
[3:38:11.520 --> 3:38:16.240]  has been writing about this a lot he says look at the write-up on her wikipedia page and at
[3:38:16.240 --> 3:38:20.560]  stanford's website they're backtracking their description because apparently i didn't know
[3:38:20.560 --> 3:38:25.120]  this but it's you can have a phd yes you're a doctor blah blah but it's only a very specific
[3:38:25.120 --> 3:38:29.200]  group who is allowed to say psychologist or maybe it's psychiatrist i don't know what the
[3:38:29.200 --> 3:38:34.240]  hell it is but you need a license to say that and she got up there and swore probably because it
[3:38:34.240 --> 3:38:40.400]  sounds so cool to say it's just like colleges she knows what she's talking about so the even the left
[3:38:40.400 --> 3:38:46.080]  seems to concede that there's a lot of fishy stuff about this woman and it reminds me of course of
[3:38:46.080 --> 3:38:54.960]  the other woman anna maria something who attacked uh the human flake the aptly named the eponymous
[3:38:54.960 --> 3:39:01.200]  flake in the elevator that woman who came up to harass him and say i was raped and if you have
[3:39:01.200 --> 3:39:06.080]  someone in the supreme court you have a someone who's a rapist and you know doing the same old
[3:39:06.080 --> 3:39:09.920]  thing that everyone on the left is saying about cavernon how he's probably a rapist and we don't
[3:39:09.920 --> 3:39:14.480]  want a rapist in the supreme court and you look at jeff flake's face too he looks like such a wimp
[3:39:14.480 --> 3:39:20.320]  just crumpling in there it looked like he was gonna cry and what did he do immediately after
[3:39:20.320 --> 3:39:25.520]  he folded and no one looked up this woman anna maria whatever her name is what's her name
[3:39:25.520 --> 3:39:32.720]  anna maria arquila now she is a lesbian from columbia with two kids i don't know how she got
[3:39:32.720 --> 3:39:37.600]  two kids but you'd think you'd be a little more grateful that you move to a country a new country
[3:39:37.600 --> 3:39:42.800]  and got some kids out of the deal when you can't even your sexual activities don't even make kids
[3:39:42.800 --> 3:39:46.160]  so i don't know if she adopted them or what happened but i would be saying thanks america
[3:39:46.160 --> 3:39:51.120]  especially when she came from columbia you know what they do to clumb to gazing columbia
[3:39:51.120 --> 3:39:58.960]  shoot them dead in the head they hate lgbt in columbia murders have been going down recently
[3:39:58.960 --> 3:40:06.480]  in columbia but not lgbt i think that 109 homicides homophobic homicides last year
[3:40:07.280 --> 3:40:12.800]  and what's her takeaway america sucks america is evil america sexist and we find her she's
[3:40:12.800 --> 3:40:18.000]  been doing political activism all over the place open borders she's an anti-trump activist
[3:40:18.000 --> 3:40:23.840]  who is funded by george soros now i know that you're going to say that this sounds like more
[3:40:23.840 --> 3:40:28.640]  conspiracy theories this is what alex got kicked off at twitter for look it up folks it's the company
[3:40:28.640 --> 3:40:33.600]  that she works for i forget what it's called now democracy for progress or something that company
[3:40:34.240 --> 3:40:41.520]  is funded by open society foundation which is a soros company so we have a soros funded
[3:40:41.520 --> 3:40:48.400]  activist with a long spread out reputation of promoting leftist causes that have nothing
[3:40:48.400 --> 3:40:54.320]  to do with rape by the way her her area of expertise was open borders latinas latinos
[3:40:54.320 --> 3:41:01.280]  getting subsidized housing um less immigration restriction you know the whole abolish ice that's
[3:41:01.280 --> 3:41:07.120]  been her area of expertise and then all of a sudden today or the other day she's the woman
[3:41:07.120 --> 3:41:12.560]  handling the rape victims and we just fold immediately it's like that guy prudent from the
[3:41:12.560 --> 3:41:17.520]  epa some woman comes up comes up to him at a restaurant holding her toddler she suspiciously
[3:41:17.520 --> 3:41:23.360]  has pre-written cards that she reads out that was on july 1st monday july 1st she goes this is my
[3:41:23.360 --> 3:41:28.800]  son he wants to drink clean drinking water he also wants to be out in the sun and be able to breathe
[3:41:28.800 --> 3:41:35.360]  the air you are an evil epa guy center for popular democracy that was anna maria arquela's
[3:41:35.360 --> 3:41:41.040]  group and she reads that to scott prudent the epa guy and that's on monday thursday
[3:41:42.320 --> 3:41:52.320]  he quits why are we such wimps why is the right so eager to capitulate they don't question
[3:41:52.320 --> 3:41:57.440]  anyone if i was in the elevator i'd say who are you where are you from what's your group
[3:41:57.440 --> 3:42:02.000]  what is your motive here and as far as the cavanaugh case you keep screaming about
[3:42:02.000 --> 3:42:07.280]  where's the evidence do we just start throwing men in jail based on allegations well that's
[3:42:07.280 --> 3:42:11.920]  an awfully handy weapon to give to a hundred percent of the woman in the world i have to we
[3:42:11.920 --> 3:42:16.640]  can't have a justice system like that you don't want a justice system like that for your sons
[3:42:16.640 --> 3:42:21.840]  for your brothers for your father we have the magna carta for a reason we've been working on this
[3:42:21.840 --> 3:42:27.200]  for a while and as far as prudent goes i'd say why are you reading these from a card who are you
[3:42:27.200 --> 3:42:31.520]  and where do you get the idea that all these restrictions and all this government intervention
[3:42:31.520 --> 3:42:37.920]  actually makes the world less polluted there's no evidence of that like argue with them don't fold
[3:42:37.920 --> 3:42:45.920]  like a house of cards grow some balls america grow some balls right wingers republicans swamp

[3:46:59.760 --> 3:47:10.560]  go
[3:47:15.440 --> 3:47:22.560]  live from the info wars dot com studios you're listening to the alex jones show
[3:47:22.560 --> 3:47:30.560]  live welcome back i forgot to mention something
[3:47:31.280 --> 3:47:37.200]  ryan here mike my uh compatriot just uh my my my colleague my what do they say the
[3:47:37.200 --> 3:47:42.640]  communists my comrad comrad ryan brought up something i've forgotten about remember this
[3:47:42.640 --> 3:47:49.440]  dr blazey ford's parents were trying to put through a foreclosure and the judge said no
[3:47:49.440 --> 3:47:54.320]  the judge was kavanaugh's mother we don't hear about this stuff we don't hear that that one of
[3:47:54.320 --> 3:47:59.920]  the new accusers who is saying that kavanaugh molestered her has a history of fakes a sexual
[3:47:59.920 --> 3:48:05.600]  assault allegations do you think that there is anything the left won't do they happily throw
[3:48:05.600 --> 3:48:12.400]  their children into the wood chipper and they say this is my son he's trans he's two and we're going
[3:48:12.400 --> 3:48:17.280]  to be giving him hormone blockers they are happily sacrificing their children to virtue signal
[3:48:17.280 --> 3:48:20.720]  to make them look good they're using their children as fashion accessories look at all
[3:48:20.720 --> 3:48:25.600]  these celebrities going around and adopting babies from africa to make them look less racist
[3:48:25.600 --> 3:48:30.160]  they don't give a crap about ethics they are totally immoral they're happy to use children
[3:48:30.160 --> 3:48:36.240]  as tools so i would imagine it's quite conceivable that many of these women would be less than
[3:48:36.240 --> 3:48:41.680]  sincere with their allegations especially this soros activist attacking people in the elevator
[3:48:41.680 --> 3:48:44.800]  but i want to switch gears a little bit because i'm really excited to see this footage
[3:48:44.800 --> 3:48:52.000]  that owens shryer got um in uh deep was it dc uh hold on let me just read this here uh
[3:48:52.000 --> 3:48:59.200]  owens shryer bit b2 rally why is he called b2 is he a robot it's like something at a short circuit
[3:48:59.200 --> 3:49:07.440]  two beto beto it sounds so much like beta what an irritating nickname anyway beta he's the guy
[3:49:07.440 --> 3:49:12.320]  that all the democrats are excited about owens shryer at beta rally i'm going to call him beta
[3:49:12.320 --> 3:49:19.040]  at beta rally on saturday triggered many while wearing a mega hat oh my god that's so esoteric
[3:49:19.040 --> 3:49:25.840]  he's wearing a hat that supports the president who was democratically elected that's not a weird
[3:49:25.840 --> 3:49:33.280]  hat a weird hat is like women you should grab women's tits or something like that's an offensive
[3:49:33.280 --> 3:49:38.400]  thing to put on your head i support the president that should be the most mainstream thing you
[3:49:38.400 --> 3:49:43.680]  could do we're living in an era where having an american flag is seen as audacious it's like when
[3:49:43.680 --> 3:49:50.320]  i lived in kebek and speaking english was seen as a shocking thing to do anyway he's wearing a mega hat
[3:49:51.760 --> 3:49:56.720]  one democrat even said america was never great talking taking a talking point from new governor
[3:49:56.720 --> 3:50:02.000]  mario kwomo and other tolerant liberal cusses owen another tolerable cusses owen out but
[3:50:02.000 --> 3:50:07.920]  repeatedly uh next to his wife and daughter now can i say something before you show the video i

[3:50:18.000 --> 3:50:24.240]  for wearing a mega hat and when he was in the ambulance the emergency guy the er guy said uh
[3:50:24.240 --> 3:50:30.640]  america was never great america was never perfect it was always great how can you not understand
[3:50:30.640 --> 3:50:36.960]  that nowhere was ever perfect why do you hate your country so much anyway let's watch this footage i
[3:50:36.960 --> 3:50:43.040]  can't wait to see it i do like your hat and i and i'm not even necessarily the biggest trump

[3:51:06.480 --> 3:51:12.880]  country in the world all right who gave who gave women the right to vote who gave women the right
[3:51:12.880 --> 3:51:20.240]  to vote america who freed slavery who ended slavery america who who came up with the idea
[3:51:20.240 --> 3:51:26.000]  that an independent citizen was sovereign and could govern itself who came up with that america
[3:51:26.000 --> 3:51:32.560]  that's why america is great sir counterpoint so you're so when were we great i just told you
[3:51:32.560 --> 3:51:38.320]  but that no no no no no no no you just want to accept the truth a country that had slavery before
[3:51:38.320 --> 3:51:43.440]  means that every country had slavery every country did not have slavery who sold who sold the slaves
[3:51:43.440 --> 3:51:49.280]  to americans who sold the slaves well first of all we're you know the we're from again you avoid
[3:51:49.280 --> 3:51:54.480]  the truth again you avoid the truth kingdom but you know we had slaves from africa okay so african
[3:51:54.480 --> 3:52:02.320]  sold africans to slavery and america stopped it we were not really the united states back then we
[3:52:02.320 --> 3:52:07.920]  were no no no no we fought a civil war that's right republicans into slavery democrats fought to keep
[3:52:07.920 --> 3:52:13.440]  slaves well the political parties changed over time did they because it seems like the democrats
[3:52:13.440 --> 3:52:20.080]  still want every black voter on their plantation then why did they choose barack obama then
[3:52:21.680 --> 3:52:28.160]  barack obama the half black one he's not half black yeah his mother was white no he's american so

[3:52:36.640 --> 3:52:46.080]  those words no no i didn't end up in jail no why would he end up in jail he illegally he illegally
[3:52:46.080 --> 3:52:52.000]  made a plan to spy on the trump campaign he did not he did not spy on the trump campaign no i'm
[3:52:52.000 --> 3:52:57.840]  telling you brock obama have you seen the text the text yeah did you did you see the uh the declassified
[3:52:57.840 --> 3:53:02.960]  documents well i mean it's not a debate they spied on the trump campaign this isn't fake news this
[3:53:02.960 --> 3:53:08.880]  is mainstream well-known declassified information well did they get a court order to do that if
[3:53:08.880 --> 3:53:14.320]  they oh they did they got the fiesel warrants you know how they got it it's it's a process though
[3:53:14.320 --> 3:53:19.680]  no i know the process i've read all the documents they made a fake piss gate dossier claiming that
[3:53:19.680 --> 3:53:25.520]  trump had hookers pee on him in russia totally made up admitted it's made up now and that's how
[3:53:25.520 --> 3:53:31.360]  they started the investigation so they started an investigation on a fake document that's called
[3:53:31.360 --> 3:53:37.120]  a felony they won't charge obama with that because he never lied because he's above the law he does
[3:53:37.120 --> 3:53:41.440]  not allow he did he said hillary clinton he didn't know she had a private server turns out he was
[3:53:41.440 --> 3:53:46.720]  emailing her on that server hillary clinton is also i think she's a very honest woman that has
[3:53:46.720 --> 3:53:52.000]  integrity and you don't know what you're talking about so well i just schooled you all right but

[3:54:08.720 --> 3:54:14.400]  know less less government and regulation less taxes and don't touch my second amendment the truth
[3:54:14.400 --> 3:54:19.120]  is though it really isn't about taxes in any other political environment they would want to cut the
[3:54:19.120 --> 3:54:24.800]  taxes it's because low taxes are now associated with trump they have to hate low taxes that's how
[3:54:25.360 --> 3:54:29.440]  much they hate trump that's how their hatred blinds everything else politically and so now
[3:54:29.440 --> 3:54:34.400]  that trump is attached to low taxes oh now they want higher taxes yeah for sure i mean i feel like
[3:54:34.400 --> 3:54:38.320]  now it's become a divide based off of what political party you are instead of based off of the issues
