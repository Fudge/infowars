[00:59.000 --> 01:04.920]  at the start of the next hour for about 30 minutes we're going to have open
[01:04.920 --> 01:10.240]  phones today to give you a chance to chime in on the conversion of our
[01:10.240 --> 01:17.440]  Republic from a once quasi-free nation to a globalist held enclave and so that
[01:17.440 --> 01:20.960]  is going to be coming up today as well as we look at the fiscal cliff that is
[01:20.960 --> 01:25.880]  just used as a manipulative backdrop to say oh we've got to increase taxes or
[01:25.880 --> 01:30.280]  the whole country will implode it's just a repeat of being held hostage in
[01:30.280 --> 01:37.960]  2008 saying give us unlimited funding or there'll be martial law remember how
[01:37.960 --> 01:45.760]  the head of the Treasury Paulson came out and and told Congress that so that's
[01:45.760 --> 01:50.880]  exactly what's going on that's exactly what's unfolding right now that will
[01:50.880 --> 01:56.360]  give you the latest on that also a lot of reports of increasing crime not just
[01:56.360 --> 02:00.080]  here in the United States but in Europe as well this global depression is just
[02:00.080 --> 02:06.760]  starting to get rolling and again it's a consolidation program on purpose also I
[02:06.760 --> 02:10.360]  knew it was going to happen I made the joke yesterday I'm not really the joke I
[02:10.360 --> 02:16.000]  was I was putting up with a joke Bob Costas is that he blaming you know people
[02:16.000 --> 02:21.760]  for violence out there he was blaming guns not people and I made the point that
[02:21.760 --> 02:27.960]  I wonder Bob Costas will blame this Dallas cowboy flipping the vehicle with
[02:27.960 --> 02:33.960]  his friend Jerry Brown this will one of the starting linemen and killing him
[02:33.960 --> 02:40.160]  and sure enough mothers against drunk driving and others are saying they want
[02:40.160 --> 02:45.640]  breathalyzers on all cars for everybody France is already starting that and the
[02:45.640 --> 02:49.360]  Dallas Cowboys are saying that they're mulling devices to mobilize players
[02:49.360 --> 02:58.880]  cars for all of them so they'll all be guilty until proven innocent and this is
[02:58.880 --> 03:07.040]  the mode everything's going to if somebody gets shot well everyone loses
[03:07.040 --> 03:11.560]  their second amendment if somebody robs a bank well we all go on probation that's
[03:11.560 --> 03:16.240]  that's the authoritarian model and of course the actual alpha criminals on
[03:16.240 --> 03:26.200]  top the King rats are all exempt so we are going to be breaking breaking that

[09:00.080 --> 09:05.040]  nebula not true or that the galaxy's gonna flip or there's going to be a
[09:05.040 --> 09:11.640]  pole shift or the Sun's going to blow up and none of them even debate with each
[09:11.640 --> 09:15.880]  other they just all agree and I'm getting criticized mightily I've noticed
[09:15.880 --> 09:19.960]  and I will be more criticized when the earth does not blow up or we don't die
[09:19.960 --> 09:23.600]  in ten and a half days from now depending on which time zone it's 10
[09:23.600 --> 09:29.680]  days out in fact we put the big clock up the doomsday clock back on back on

[10:18.160 --> 10:20.680]  open the phones I've always say that go to calls the last segment of the hour
[10:20.680 --> 10:24.680]  if you want to talk about the fiscal cliff and give me your take on it if you
[10:24.680 --> 10:27.840]  want to get into our government publicly now the New York Times yesterday
[10:27.840 --> 10:32.480]  admitted our government's mainly using al-Qaeda as the liberators of Syria you
[10:32.480 --> 10:36.000]  heard it our government our military along with NATO and others are helping
[10:36.000 --> 10:41.560]  al-Qaeda overthrow a country that attacked no one in a 22 month invasion now
[10:41.560 --> 10:45.000]  they're talking about no flies zone peaceful bombing operations because
[10:45.000 --> 10:49.400]  Obama's a peace prize winner so when he drops bombs it's it's peaceful it's
[10:49.400 --> 10:56.200]  trendy to very very trendy all of that's heating up with calls before the UN you
[10:56.200 --> 11:00.160]  know saying that they've got chemical weapons so we've got to attack them and
[11:00.160 --> 11:05.280]  the Assad regime came out and said listen we're not going to use it the al-Qaeda
[11:05.280 --> 11:09.760]  jihadis have been shot on videotape and they have killing animals with the
[11:09.760 --> 11:13.000]  nerve gas they're saying they're going to use on us and that's how it'll work
[11:13.000 --> 11:17.720]  al-Qaeda will launch chemical attacks it'll be blamed on Syria and they'll be
[11:17.720 --> 11:22.040]  leveled why would why would they launch a chemical attack and then give the
[11:22.040 --> 11:27.760]  less an excuse to attack yeah there's the New York Times right there Syrian
[11:27.760 --> 11:32.600]  rebels tied to al-Qaeda play key role in war we've been telling you that for over
[11:32.600 --> 11:39.880]  a year now it's in the New York Times so it must be true you know we told you a
[11:39.880 --> 11:43.480]  decade ago plus that they're putting cameras and microphones in the
[11:43.480 --> 11:47.480]  computers and in the scientific Atlantic cable boxes and other things and I
[11:47.480 --> 11:52.600]  showed you the patents on air and I was the crazy man now it's associated press
[11:52.600 --> 11:58.160]  Reuters you name it that Google Verizon they're all doing I told you 16 years
[11:58.160 --> 12:01.920]  ago that they're listening to your phones even when your phones are off with
[12:01.920 --> 12:08.400]  keywords it's now admitted I told you the government runs al-Qaeda against the
[12:08.400 --> 12:12.720]  Russians against the Serbs against the American people so they can take our
[12:12.720 --> 12:17.440]  liberty against the Iranians against the Libyans against the Syrians al-Qaeda
[12:17.440 --> 12:22.200]  works for the globalists who run our country and now that's all mainstream news
[12:22.200 --> 12:27.240]  do I get an apology for that I told you four years ago in 2008 that they would
[12:27.240 --> 12:32.120]  hold us hostage over and over again with fiscal cliffs with the Secretary of the
[12:32.120 --> 12:37.120]  Treasury threatening Congress you can pull these clips up we've played to
[12:37.120 --> 12:39.840]  many times in fact that should be right there and we had different
[12:39.840 --> 12:44.320]  congressmen on who first broke they were told in closed session martial law
[12:44.320 --> 12:54.040]  just type in Congress threatened with martial law over banker bailout 2008
[12:54.040 --> 12:57.720]  October 3rd 2008 just type that I'm gonna show people the news headline where
[12:57.720 --> 13:01.640]  they can find the YouTube video of the different congressmen on this show and
[13:01.640 --> 13:05.400]  then no one believed it for a week and then it became mainstream news see
[13:05.400 --> 13:10.360]  that's why the establishment puts out a meme that we're not accurate or that you
[13:10.360 --> 13:15.200]  know we're wrong about this and that because we're so accurate I mean it's
[13:15.200 --> 13:19.640]  not like it's hard to be accurate we've watched the same group of megabanks do
[13:19.640 --> 13:27.960]  this in country after country we know how they do it I mean the TSA in 2002 I
[13:27.960 --> 13:32.800]  was watching C-span with the head of Homeland Security Governor Ridge who
[13:32.800 --> 13:35.240]  later wrote a book admitting they would put out fake terror alerts as the
[13:35.240 --> 13:39.920]  pretext to take liberties we told you that too it's just comments like saying
[13:39.920 --> 13:45.200]  I told you those sky was blue at high noon I mean it is blue people like oh my
[13:45.200 --> 13:49.560]  gosh they're either like how did you know this or oh you were never right
[13:49.560 --> 13:53.840]  about anything that's the meme that's put out we told you that the TSA would be
[13:53.840 --> 13:57.520]  on the highways and the train stations and the bus stations because they said
[13:57.520 --> 14:01.640]  that was their plan they said you'll have to get an authorization from them to
[14:01.640 --> 14:07.600]  own a gun to travel to get on a plane or leave the country that's all now being
[14:07.600 --> 14:12.520]  announced that's exactly what every authoritarian system from ancient Rome
[14:12.520 --> 14:24.520]  to Pol Potts Cambodia to Stalin's Russia to Hitler's Germany to Cuba's Fidel
[14:24.520 --> 14:30.720]  Castro I mean this is standard this is standard black uniforms surveillance
[14:30.720 --> 14:36.560]  citizen spies intimidation of people for their speech I mean we're following an
[14:36.560 --> 14:45.880]  exact script it's not it's not rocket science and we're we're going down this
[14:45.880 --> 14:49.400]  road and they've done this four times the last four years in Europe they've
[14:49.400 --> 14:54.120]  done it several times here oh if we don't give you know tens of billions of
[14:54.120 --> 14:56.840]  dollars the General Motors it'll go bankrupt and they pay to move them to
[14:56.840 --> 15:02.800]  China Eastern Europe and Brazil oh if you don't give us 874 billion we'll go
[15:02.800 --> 15:07.680]  bankrupt it was actually just an open window signing us on to the 644 trillion
[15:07.680 --> 15:13.240]  of domestic derivatives fraud created by the six megabanks
[15:14.120 --> 15:18.840]  yeah there's representative Burgess Congress under martial law the past
[15:18.840 --> 15:23.400]  banker bailout the daily newscaster and that's another congressman I want to
[15:23.400 --> 15:27.040]  find our interviews with the congressman if you just type in you guys found one
[15:27.040 --> 15:33.320]  of them if you type in Congress was threatened with martial law that'll
[15:33.320 --> 15:37.360]  just pull it up because they also have a term they call martial law when the
[15:37.360 --> 15:41.640]  committee chairs take control and but that was a separate issue that was the
[15:41.640 --> 15:46.000]  right story the point is people forget about all this they were threatened with
[15:46.000 --> 15:49.680]  blood in the street tanks on the streets total collapse 10,000 point stock
[15:49.680 --> 15:54.160]  market drop if they didn't give them a blank check Europe's gone through this
[15:54.160 --> 15:59.600]  four times now and now they're saying give us one point six trillion in tax
[15:59.600 --> 16:08.360]  increases one point two trillion in total wipeout of all deductions and the
[16:08.360 --> 16:12.720]  three point eight surcharge on basically all investments stock market
[16:12.720 --> 16:15.960]  investments everything based on that and a bunch of other taxes and the
[16:15.960 --> 16:20.760]  Republicans are like no only 990 billion increase and four hundred to
[16:20.760 --> 16:25.880]  600 billion in wiping out almost all but not all but most of the tax
[16:25.880 --> 16:30.360]  exemptions on and on and on and yeah we'll go on everything else you want and
[16:30.360 --> 16:34.120]  we'll even give the president the power to automatically increase the debt limit
[16:34.120 --> 16:40.480]  I mean that that's martial law over the power of the purse let me tell you if a
[16:40.480 --> 16:43.920]  president can just raise the debt limit whenever he wants he can destroy you
[16:43.920 --> 16:46.960]  Democratic Congress and representatives were threatened with martial law in
[16:46.960 --> 16:54.840]  America over bailout Steve Watson October 3rd October 3rd October 3rd 2008

[24:45.560 --> 24:51.140]  fiscal cliff and if we could just get the public to not know who all the sitcom
[24:51.140 --> 24:55.740]  stars are and not know who all the football players were and actually know
[24:55.740 --> 25:00.980]  how government worked people would wake up to how the scam is operating and
[25:00.980 --> 25:07.100]  realize we are being delivered into an authoritarian anti-liberty system where
[25:07.100 --> 25:10.900]  the power structure the megabanks can choose the winners and the losers and
[25:10.900 --> 25:15.380]  where things are actually worried out to phase out private wealth that is not in
[25:15.380 --> 25:19.420]  the hands of globalist as a tool of total control we are going into a
[25:19.420 --> 25:22.460]  scientific dictatorship that's why you have all the secret and then
[25:22.460 --> 25:26.220]  declassified chemical biological radiological testing on the American
[25:26.220 --> 25:29.700]  people that's why you have the medical tyranny model of forced inoculations
[25:29.700 --> 25:34.740]  they're trying to force in worldwide that's why you see health care now
[25:34.740 --> 25:40.740]  codified and controlled by federal law saying what health care you will get it's
[25:40.740 --> 25:43.820]  happening the state's all over saying we're gonna inject your kids without
[25:43.820 --> 25:47.940]  consent at the school and not tell you we're gonna take your 10-year-old for
[25:47.940 --> 25:51.820]  an abortion never mind your kids are going into puberty at age 8 when they
[25:51.820 --> 25:55.260]  should be going into it at 14 never mind why that's happening let's just move
[25:55.260 --> 26:00.540]  forward we're under attack you're under attack and you can have the mental
[26:00.540 --> 26:04.580]  strength to understand that yeah when I talk about scary but I'm not trying to
[26:04.580 --> 26:10.300]  scare you I'm trying to get you moving if your house was burning and I came in
[26:10.300 --> 26:13.140]  banging on the door your neighbor did and said get up Bob your house is
[26:13.140 --> 26:17.460]  burning you wouldn't come to the door coughing and say don't fear monger bill
[26:17.460 --> 26:22.300]  I'm not Bob your house on fire why are you in there laying in the bed while
[26:22.300 --> 26:26.580]  your house is about to collapse well I'm just thinking positively and I'm not
[26:26.580 --> 26:32.220]  gonna be negative positive is assessing the real situation and making a
[26:32.220 --> 26:36.860]  preparation for it and we are going to hell in a handbasket the reason the
[26:36.860 --> 26:40.980]  public so decadent and so dumb down on the West the reason we're living less
[26:40.980 --> 26:46.100]  the reason we're so unhealthy the reason we lead the world in the West now in
[26:46.100 --> 26:50.100]  diabetes cancer and other diseases every one of them is because we're being
[26:50.100 --> 26:56.380]  murdered they kill us with soft kill to extract the money out of this while we
[26:56.380 --> 27:01.380]  slowly die in the third world they just inject him with live polio and HIV and
[27:01.380 --> 27:08.580]  get caught and no one gets in trouble for it so this is the type of garbage
[27:08.580 --> 27:15.020]  that we're dealing with and when I get up here and I tell you in 2008 this is
[27:15.020 --> 27:18.820]  the model here's the IMF here's the World Bank bragging in their own
[27:18.820 --> 27:22.820]  documents that were released in 2002 how they were next gonna implode Europe in
[27:22.820 --> 27:29.140]  the US that's in my book descent into tyranny when Joseph Stiglitz left the
[27:29.140 --> 27:32.100]  World Bank as their chief economist Nobel Prize winner he says he didn't
[27:32.100 --> 27:39.020]  release the documents okay but the BBC got 2000 plus pages of them and we were
[27:39.020 --> 27:44.460]  able to release them first with Greg Palast here on this broadcast BBC only
[27:44.460 --> 27:50.460]  letting put out some of it he put out even more here and that and we said
[27:50.460 --> 27:54.020]  within 10 years they will implode Europe in the US the same way they do the
[27:54.020 --> 27:58.700]  third world and there is 112 point plan how they do it you might want to go
[27:58.700 --> 28:03.260]  read the 112 point IMF plan I mean just it's the future of the world I mean you
[28:03.260 --> 28:06.700]  might want to know that for business let's say you're some greedy self-serving
[28:06.700 --> 28:10.140]  new world order person who's mid-level you might actually want to know what's
[28:10.140 --> 28:13.700]  really going on and get outside the compartmentalization that's where real
[28:13.700 --> 28:18.380]  power comes from it's all there they operate like you don't have an IQ and
[28:18.380 --> 28:22.340]  and so it's all public let's let's go to break with this clip of Congressman
[28:22.340 --> 28:28.300]  Sherman who first said this on my show a day before and then people didn't believe
[28:28.300 --> 28:35.220]  it so he went out on TV and set it on c-span about martial law and that's
[28:35.220 --> 28:38.780]  what's happening right now that's why the Republicans are getting in line
[28:38.780 --> 28:43.260]  because the banks run this country they're paid for at the top by the same
[28:43.260 --> 28:48.820]  people Obama is here it is the only way they can pass this bill is by creating
[28:48.820 --> 28:55.620]  and sustaining a panic atmosphere that atmosphere is not justified many of us
[28:55.620 --> 29:01.060]  were told in private conversations that if we voted against this bill on Monday
[29:01.060 --> 29:06.420]  that the sky would fall the market would drop two or three thousand points the
[29:06.420 --> 29:10.460]  first day another couple thousand the second day and a few members were even
[29:10.460 --> 29:16.660]  told that there would be martial law in America if we voted no that's what I
[29:16.660 --> 29:23.000]  call fear mongering unjustified proven wrong we've got a week we've got two
[29:23.000 --> 29:26.660]  weeks to write a good bill that's good the only way to and by the way I had
[29:26.660 --> 29:30.740]  other congressmen on breaking this at the time and people thought I had fake
[29:30.740 --> 29:35.780]  congressmen on okay just like when I told you the NSA spot on you without
[29:35.780 --> 29:39.380]  warrants oh that can't be true when I had whistleblowers on over a decade ago
[29:39.380 --> 29:43.900]  now it's all admitted folks this is real okay we'll be right back stay with

[33:43.940 --> 33:48.540]  they're all racist and bad and this is all part of the divide and conquer

[33:53.340 --> 33:58.740]  said about machete when I got the script from concerned people on the
[33:58.740 --> 34:05.620]  production crew and part of it was cut but it was still a call for race war it's
[34:05.620 --> 34:09.300]  amazing and if you go to drudgerport.com they've got the video linked we're also
[34:09.300 --> 34:14.060]  getting it up at info wars.com Jamie Foxx jokes about killing all the white
[34:14.060 --> 34:18.940]  people in his new movie he says I kill all the white people in the movie how
[34:18.940 --> 34:24.060]  great is that to thunderous applause from the video transcript of Saturday Night
[34:24.060 --> 34:32.820]  Live we're gonna play that coming up and of course he said last week that
[34:32.820 --> 34:38.460]  Obama is our Lord and Savior and that we should pray to him and this is all done
[34:38.460 --> 34:44.340]  to generate publicity and it's allowed by the power structure to create division
[34:44.340 --> 34:48.820]  in fact the senator from West Virginia I had this in the stack yesterday well you
[34:48.820 --> 34:53.220]  guys dig that up I never got to it talked about these MTV shows where they
[34:53.220 --> 35:01.140]  go find the poorest most degenerate pathetic drug doubt appellation folks
[35:01.140 --> 35:05.860]  and then put it out there but they would never do this with people in the
[35:05.860 --> 35:10.220]  Hispanic or black community and again it's meant to sell that image that whites
[35:10.220 --> 35:15.940]  are absolute trash and garbage and it's culture war on the other end MTV and I've
[35:15.940 --> 35:19.740]  talked to multiple high-level people that were inside MTV in the mid 90s they
[35:19.740 --> 35:23.780]  said we're gonna push this gangster rap and we're gonna push stuff like Marilyn
[35:23.780 --> 35:28.540]  Manson to destroy the white kids we're gonna push this gangster rap to just
[35:28.540 --> 35:36.180]  absolutely destroy the black kids I've talked to multiple sources this is Joe
[35:36.180 --> 35:45.900]  Manson objects to MTV's buck wild reality show and it goes on to say as a
[35:45.900 --> 35:50.940]  US senator I am repulsed at the business venture where some Americans are
[35:50.940 --> 35:56.460]  making money off the poor decisions of the youth Manson wrote I cannot imagine
[35:56.460 --> 36:01.620]  that anyone who loves this country which will proud profiting off of buck wild
[36:01.620 --> 36:06.900]  instead of showcasing the beauty of our people in our state you prayed on young
[36:06.900 --> 36:10.460]  people coax them in displaying shameful behavior oh folks I've been around these
[36:10.460 --> 36:13.860]  reality shows I've talked to count people that were involved in them and they try
[36:13.860 --> 36:19.540]  to get you to do bad things they try to get you to do bad things and now you are
[36:19.540 --> 36:24.620]  profiting from it that is just wrong that's why I'm not stupid enough to have
[36:24.620 --> 36:30.180]  no exaggeration turned down ten offers five or six times with contracts on the
[36:30.180 --> 36:35.300]  table for massive amounts of money and I've said no like you really don't want
[36:35.300 --> 36:38.460]  to have your big show you'll be a but I'm like no I know what you're gonna do I
[36:38.460 --> 36:43.820]  know what you're gonna do like well we are gonna have to have access to your
[36:43.820 --> 36:45.820]  family and you are gonna have to have some drama
[36:45.820 --> 36:52.260]  isn't happening there's no drama I work work about 15 16 hours a day I read to
[36:52.260 --> 36:58.100]  my kids and play with you know toys on the wood floor I walk around on my
[36:58.100 --> 37:04.020]  property there was some excitement yesterday the Labrador ran into a raccoon
[37:04.020 --> 37:08.340]  and the fight ensued in the lab killed it I actually have video of it was pretty
[37:08.340 --> 37:12.780]  powerful video and I'm debating whether I should air it but you watch if
[37:12.780 --> 37:16.300]  national geographic aired it would be oh great or all these other shows but if I
[37:16.300 --> 37:20.860]  did it would be terrible to show it absolute come on plus I had to get out
[37:20.860 --> 37:25.260]  in the swamp there's a swamp near my house I had to wait across it up to my
[37:25.260 --> 37:29.540]  neck holding the phone up then got there the phone was a full I got everything
[37:29.540 --> 37:32.700]  off my phone guys remind me then I had to raise some stuff so I could take the
[37:32.700 --> 37:39.980]  aftermath of it but it was still a it was side issue instead of showcasing the
[37:39.980 --> 37:43.540]  beauty of our people and our state you prayed on young people coax them in a
[37:43.540 --> 37:47.180]  displaying chamber behavior and now you are profiting from it that is just
[37:47.180 --> 37:51.740]  wrong yeah it's like honey boo boo and all this stuff and and that is what
[37:51.740 --> 37:57.060]  America has been turned into but you know I could go do a reality show in
[37:57.060 --> 38:01.460]  East Austin and go in and show people things that are just ungodly and said I
[38:01.460 --> 38:06.420]  try to help those people I could go show poor black people and but oh no no that
[38:06.420 --> 38:09.900]  wouldn't be politically correct see plus they've already got them where they
[38:09.900 --> 38:14.220]  want them on average ruined wreck destroyed they don't want that that to
[38:14.220 --> 38:17.540]  be known about what government creates they want to show you instead what
[38:17.540 --> 38:24.260]  government has created with the archetypal Appalachian Hillbilly and it
[38:24.260 --> 38:28.020]  is so unbelievably sad and this is the new you know these are the top shows now
[38:28.020 --> 38:32.220]  and it's a feedback loop and the globalist Sumner Redstone and others
[38:32.220 --> 38:38.660]  are celebrating what they've done so there is that report speaking of that
[38:38.660 --> 38:46.100]  do we have the video yet we're capturing it okay we're gonna we're gonna play
[38:46.100 --> 38:48.660]  that video coming up I want to give the number out and take some of your calls
[38:48.660 --> 38:51.780]  ahead of Jesse Ventura popping in then we'll continue with calls and a ton of
[38:51.780 --> 39:00.260]  news toll-free number to join us is 800-259-9231 800-2599-231 first-time
[39:00.260 --> 39:05.780]  callers yet again by the way I I made the point yesterday I said how long
[39:05.780 --> 39:11.860]  until Bob Costas who blames guns for people's violent actions in the NFL how
[39:11.860 --> 39:20.580]  long until Bob Costas blames cars and everyone else for NFL players up in
[39:20.580 --> 39:26.300]  Dallas Dallas Cowboys Calvin Hicks driving now charged with manslaughter
[39:26.300 --> 39:31.700]  with a vehicle and one of the starting alignment I was really cool I'd say you
[39:31.700 --> 39:35.900]  know nose guard I'd know all the facts about it be really manly but I'm not
[39:35.900 --> 39:42.020]  Jerry Brown got killed when the vehicle rolled over when they were driving
[39:42.020 --> 39:46.500]  around from a private club now they're gonna go in diet and charge they're
[39:46.500 --> 39:48.620]  over there right now the private club they were at as if they didn't get
[39:48.620 --> 39:51.620]  liquored up and go over there now they want breathalyzers in the clubs is a
[39:51.620 --> 39:55.140]  total surveillance grid even though distracted driving the estimate that
[39:55.140 --> 39:59.420]  even the government does five times the deaths so most of their answer is a
[39:59.420 --> 40:03.740]  rescue if you're eating a hot dog while you're driving so see oh we got to have
[40:03.740 --> 40:06.300]  cameras in the car surveilling you open it we just so happen to come up with
[40:06.300 --> 40:09.980]  these AI computers to do it told you that over a decade ago because Toyota said
[40:09.980 --> 40:12.860]  they were gonna do that in the future and now France is passing along where all
[40:12.860 --> 40:18.540]  cars have breathalyzers hooked into a cell phone reporting back to the police so
[40:18.540 --> 40:21.540]  guess what happened they've been calling for a long time for all cars have
[40:21.540 --> 40:25.940]  breathalyzers and a little surveillance suite you pay for on Star basically
[40:25.940 --> 40:30.220]  mandatory we're being surveilled cowboys mole devised to immobilize players
[40:30.220 --> 40:35.860]  cars Calvin Hill asked himself the question repeatedly in his role as a
[40:35.860 --> 40:40.100]  consultant for the Dallas Cowboys with responsibility of administering off the
[40:40.100 --> 40:44.420]  field support programs and it wasn't Calvin Hill that's one of the other
[40:44.420 --> 40:47.140]  names I don't even know all the names excuse me I had a big step that's not
[40:47.140 --> 40:49.820]  the guy charged that was one of the guy running the programs that was a mistake
[40:49.820 --> 40:54.800]  he is searching for the answers in the wake of the single car alcohol related
[40:54.800 --> 41:00.420]  crash early Saturday that killed practice squad linebacker Jerry Brown and
[41:00.420 --> 41:04.340]  left defensive tackle Josh Brent Josh Brent's the one that's getting charged
[41:04.340 --> 41:10.140]  facing a toxification manslaughter charges obviously we do whatever we can
[41:10.140 --> 41:15.580]  he'll shed soberly before Sunday's game at Paul Brown Stadium alluding to the
[41:15.580 --> 41:22.460]  team's educational programs but now they're calling for having the NFL team
[41:22.460 --> 41:30.220]  association push to have breathalyzers in all the vehicles and of course mad is
[41:30.220 --> 41:36.620]  involved in the whole program so so that's what's going on here and it's
[41:36.620 --> 41:44.180]  just incredible that you've got Josh Brent now being charged with a
[41:44.180 --> 41:51.980]  toxication manslaughter and Jerry Brown dead and Calvin Hill yeah who's been a
[41:51.980 --> 41:56.420]  consultant trying to stop all this drunk driving and all this stuff is asking
[41:56.420 --> 42:02.540]  himself when is this gonna end you know what more can we do and then now they're
[42:02.540 --> 42:10.020]  talking about mad having you know having them basically oversee things having
[42:10.020 --> 42:14.140]  breathalyzers put in the cars and that's USA Today Cowboys mold device to
[42:14.140 --> 42:20.580]  mobilize players cars so guilty until proven innocent making you blow into
[42:20.580 --> 42:30.100]  things before you can drive everyone guilty until proven innocent this is the
[42:30.100 --> 42:34.980]  type of system they're pushing and and that's exactly you know the thing that
[42:34.980 --> 42:40.940]  Bob Costas is calling for you know you can't trust men members quote members
[42:40.940 --> 42:44.460]  quote on the Arale factory said you can't trust men 20 to 30 I stand by that
[42:44.460 --> 42:49.220]  to own guns you just can't trust them you can't trust these guys to drive cars
[42:49.220 --> 42:53.620]  without breathalyzers on them as society degenerates because of the
[42:53.620 --> 42:59.420]  dumbing down the fluoride the water the poisoning the chemicals the GMO the
[42:59.420 --> 43:02.260]  systems gonna say well all of you basically have to live in a prison now
[43:02.260 --> 43:06.260]  and be under 24 hours surveillance that the government's gonna run when it's
[43:06.260 --> 43:09.740]  run by the foreign banks that are carrying out this eugenics and next
[43:09.740 --> 43:13.740]  let me show you this and I'm going to your phone calls it's a story from last

[46:42.860 --> 46:46.900]  here's this article with links to the Harvard studies and links to Colgate's
[46:46.900 --> 46:49.860]  own announcements okay this is this is life and death okay
[46:49.860 --> 46:58.060]  toothpaste blast kids with five thousand times more IQ crushing fluoride than
[46:58.060 --> 47:03.620]  heavily fluoridated areas with water we've got the Harvard study with massive
[47:03.620 --> 47:09.220]  IQ reductions brain damage huge increases in cancer with an index of 23
[47:09.220 --> 47:16.300]  government and university studies now up here Colgate and others are coming out
[47:16.300 --> 47:21.260]  oh a thousand times isn't enough they have fluoride extra fluoride brand it's
[47:21.260 --> 47:24.980]  like a sick joke we expose vaccines are bad they say now all pregnant women
[47:24.980 --> 47:27.820]  need extra when the inserts always said don't give it to a pregnant woman they
[47:27.820 --> 47:31.820]  know it causes miscarriages and brain damage so when we expose that and it's
[47:31.820 --> 47:35.700]  on the insert they say no we're taking it off the insert more for women so when
[47:35.700 --> 47:40.460]  it comes out in the the American Medical Association and the American Dental
[47:40.460 --> 47:44.860]  Association six years ago because of lawsuits and exposure had to come out
[47:44.860 --> 47:47.380]  and say children under six should not brush their teeth with fluoridated
[47:47.380 --> 47:52.700]  toothpaste or drink it because it causes tooth breaking bone fractures bone cancer
[47:52.700 --> 47:56.380]  and dental fluorosis we don't believe me just type in American Dental
[47:56.380 --> 48:01.100]  Association says under six shouldn't have fluoride how do they respond with
[48:01.100 --> 48:04.740]  it with us fed full forcing that devastating victory for humanity they
[48:04.740 --> 48:09.340]  quadruple down well it's more than quadruple down what's five times four
[48:09.340 --> 48:14.340]  times is quadruple what's five times quintuple they quintuple down from 1,000
[48:14.340 --> 48:19.220]  times to 5,000 times and they're putting it in thousands of foods kind of like
[48:19.220 --> 48:25.140]  we exposed what's going on with aspartame and brain damage so now they put it in
[48:25.140 --> 48:28.460]  tens of thousands of products you'd only be in hundreds it's in everything now
[48:28.460 --> 48:35.020]  literally go look aspartame deadly excitotoxin deadly deadly deadly deadly
[48:35.020 --> 48:39.620]  deadly deadly deadly deadly you know they use it fluoride sodium fluoride as
[48:39.620 --> 48:42.780]  pesticide on crops because it kills the bugs and then it bio-accumulates you know
[48:42.780 --> 48:47.060]  they use it in the white flour they use it in the pizza dough they use it in the
[48:47.060 --> 48:53.340]  cornmeal folks it's go read it's unbelievable unbelievable that's why
[48:53.340 --> 48:58.460]  you can't help the public that's why that's why you talk to full grown adults
[48:58.460 --> 49:01.980]  now they're like mind-numb zombies folks they have been murdered they're not
[49:01.980 --> 49:07.180]  even alive anymore they are zombies living zombies that's why they're showing
[49:07.180 --> 49:10.740]  us all these zombies is people at an instinctive level know we're turning
[49:10.740 --> 49:15.260]  into walking dead and so it's a dehumanization and the idea of those of
[49:15.260 --> 49:18.780]  us that can still think subconsciously hate the general public because we
[49:18.780 --> 49:22.380]  would have been genius level we're just average IQ now and so we have a
[49:22.380 --> 49:27.140]  disdain for the zombies you can't have disdain for them these are victims these
[49:27.140 --> 49:31.260]  people have been savaged go read the article get it out everybody will
[49:31.260 --> 49:37.660]  tweet it out that real Alex Jones warned people I said I'd go to your calls

[54:20.860 --> 54:24.740]  to go to this clip I mentioned the full videos up at info wars.com it's also the
[54:24.740 --> 54:29.660]  top story on drugsreport.com this is Jamie Foxx so I think it's a pretty funny
[54:29.660 --> 54:35.260]  actor and you know they do it as if it's comedy but but it's not it's done to
[54:35.260 --> 54:39.260]  create racial division somebody ought to ask Jamie Foxx you know he gets off on
[54:39.260 --> 54:44.900]  Obama calls him Lord and Savior. Obama took the restrictions off basically paying
[54:44.900 --> 54:49.180]  women to have abortions and for starving to death it makes them do it in
[54:49.180 --> 54:54.740]  Africa and massively increasing aborting black babies see here's the deal I love
[54:54.740 --> 54:59.500]  humanity and I won't sit there and make evil decisions playing God that's what
[54:59.500 --> 55:04.580]  globalists do and people need to reach out to Jamie Foxx and say I hope you
[55:04.580 --> 55:08.060]  enjoy all the aborted babies that are on your hands because that's what you've
[55:08.060 --> 55:11.780]  underwritten saying Obama's our Lord and Savior and selling this racial
[55:11.780 --> 55:18.820]  politics so this so this infiltrator Obama can sell the entire country on
[55:18.820 --> 55:23.540]  collectivism and I've talked to black folks who said I don't care if Obama's
[55:23.540 --> 55:27.060]  doubling abortion of blacks or too many little black kids anyways like we have
[55:27.060 --> 55:32.740]  those clips and it's the imagining you're in charge and that your
[55:32.740 --> 55:37.700]  guys in there and you don't care if you're being poisoned and murdered you
[55:37.700 --> 55:41.700]  don't care if they're telling people well if you want to be on welfare you
[55:41.700 --> 55:44.900]  got to take all these vaccines and using these little black kids like pin

[55:48.100 --> 55:51.940]  being added to the water in minority areas you're being murdered oh you hear
[55:51.940 --> 55:57.380]  what I just said but you don't care because it's more fun to go off shut up
[55:57.380 --> 56:01.420]  crackerhead and stuff like that and be murdered and I understand it's I mean
[56:01.420 --> 56:05.020]  Republicans like worshipping you know Republican leaders they don't care if
[56:05.020 --> 56:08.260]  they're run by foreign banks they want to think they're winning and think you
[56:08.260 --> 56:11.940]  know John McCain's their guy or think that Mitt Romney's their guy I understand
[56:11.940 --> 56:15.780]  people are in fantasy land they don't want the real thing of really knowing
[56:15.780 --> 56:19.620]  the truth and really being informed and really being in charge of your life
[56:19.620 --> 56:26.060]  they want government media to tell them what they want to hear here's a clip

[01:00:56.340 --> 01:01:00.540]  living under a national security global dictatorship and the globalist admit
[01:01:00.540 --> 01:01:05.260]  they're about 30 years ahead technologically and most of us are

[01:01:40.260 --> 01:01:43.540]  interesting question about this nurse that I don't buy at all it sounds like
[01:01:43.540 --> 01:01:48.140]  somebody went princess Diana but here's an interesting story if you care to hear
[01:01:48.140 --> 01:01:53.500]  Alex about cable TV with the ability to see you 15 years ago a kid told me about
[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:58.100]  his dad worked at Harris communications here in the city that has military
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:03.580]  contracts for communications he retires so what he does he's got his cable TV
[01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:07.660]  goes on the blank so he takes it down to the shop and works on it he's shocked to
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:11.380]  find out that the same basic mechanisms of the release which for a cable ready
[01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:15.260]  TV are the same in military communications which means you either
[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:22.060]  send or you receive you never shut off cable boxes for at least let's be
[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:26.820]  conservative 20 years have been two-way watching and listening I had an
[01:02:26.820 --> 01:02:31.580]  engineer in my house 15 years ago open up the cable box and say you see the
[01:02:31.580 --> 01:02:35.180]  microphone and we're talking this is seven or eight years before they start
[01:02:35.180 --> 01:02:39.820]  claiming it's an application for things so you can play online games and things
[01:02:39.820 --> 01:02:44.580]  and communicate that of course they've always been listening that's 1980 folks
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:50.340]  we are not in Kansas anymore I mean listen in the 40s and 50s and 60s and
[01:02:50.340 --> 01:02:54.300]  still ongoing they were taking foster kids and putting them in chambers and
[01:02:54.300 --> 01:02:59.340]  frying them in some cases till they stuck to the floor so if the government's
[01:02:59.340 --> 01:03:03.300]  gonna fry little kids like fried eggs on purpose and not getting trouble and
[01:03:03.300 --> 01:03:06.820]  bring the drugs in do you think they're gonna have cable boxes watching us just
[01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:11.860]  a question absolutely well I had cable installed about two years after I found
[01:03:11.860 --> 01:03:15.220]  out about this and I asked the cable guy about it and he says how do you know
[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:20.220]  about that exactly what he asked me yeah a lot of them get off on big power
[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:23.540]  trips I got a lot of death threats over when I first exposed it because again
[01:03:23.540 --> 01:03:27.620]  people weren't supposed to hear it at that time you know the Lord put it on my
[01:03:27.620 --> 01:03:31.900]  heart you can call it six cents discernment that that this radio show

[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:36.500]  Minnesota Governor Jesse Ventura I got a call last Friday I slept and called him
[01:08:36.500 --> 01:08:41.860]  back the Atlantic magazine said we want to know what you know about the FEMA
[01:08:41.860 --> 01:08:46.500]  show being pulled and the TSA show being pulled and I was waiting to talk to
[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:50.460]  Jesse and I just told him about he said no you just talked to him so I will so
[01:08:50.460 --> 01:08:53.700]  Aaron gave me that sheet but I put it in my stack we asked him to reprint that
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:56.380]  email I was supposed to talk to the reporter this morning but I wanted to
[01:08:56.380 --> 01:09:00.700]  wait we'll get Ventura's take on the latest on that and then I said what do
[01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:03.140]  you want to get into first and he brought up something near and dear my
[01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:08.860]  heart this has been in the Dallas weekly magazine and the Dallas Morning News
[01:09:08.860 --> 01:09:14.540]  about yours truly in fact guys just type in Alex Jones to protest 50th anniversary
[01:09:14.540 --> 01:09:19.660]  of at Dealey Plaza it'll pull up the article from a few months ago I asked
[01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:23.020]  Ventura I said hey what do you want to get into first and he said just that
[01:09:23.020 --> 01:09:26.340]  he'll tell you the story I haven't covered it in months you probably forgot or
[01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:31.540]  weren't listening that they're not allowing protesters they're gonna close
[01:09:31.540 --> 01:09:37.340]  the entire giant park which is city streets by the way and just have their
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:41.740]  propaganda on the 50th well I said months ago when this was announced we had
[01:09:41.740 --> 01:09:46.540]  Jim Mars on about it JFK truthers banned from Dealey Plaza for 50th anniversary
[01:09:46.540 --> 01:09:50.100]  Jim Mars was the first to tell me about it he was in that report and then again
[01:09:50.100 --> 01:09:55.220]  the local newspapers all covered the fact that yes it's a year away this
[01:09:55.220 --> 01:09:59.020]  country's even here then I'm going and I just invited Jesse because if the
[01:09:59.020 --> 01:10:04.300]  police hold us back we'll still be 200 yards away this is crazy this is North
[01:10:04.300 --> 01:10:08.140]  Korea style censorship governor what do you make of this give us your take on it
[01:10:08.140 --> 01:10:14.180]  well Alex you know I was at the 40th anniversary one 10 years ago and I found
[01:10:14.180 --> 01:10:19.300]  it very interesting when I was there 10 years ago there wasn't one official
[01:10:19.300 --> 01:10:23.900]  government person there there were no elected officials there the governor of
[01:10:23.900 --> 01:10:28.420]  Texas wasn't there and I know there are about ten eight to ten thousand people
[01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:32.400]  that gathered there and they asked if I would speak and so I spoke and I
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:36.860]  laughingly brought up the fact that I'm the Minnesota governor where's the
[01:10:36.860 --> 01:10:41.580]  governor of Texas and no public officials have ever been involved or
[01:10:41.580 --> 01:10:47.180]  acknowledged the Dealey Plaza anniversary until this year now all of a
[01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:52.060]  sudden they're going to cordon it off I found this out because I spent two days
[01:10:52.060 --> 01:10:57.660]  last week with Judith Ferry Baker who was Lee Harvey Oswald's lover when he
[01:10:57.660 --> 01:11:02.660]  had split up with Marina and while he lived in New Orleans who unequivocally
[01:11:02.660 --> 01:11:07.980]  will tell you that Oswald was a CIA operative and an FBI informant both he
[01:11:07.980 --> 01:11:15.060]  was a he was a intelligence worker for the US government as was he but that
[01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:20.660]  being aside they then informed me that this year they're gonna take it to
[01:11:20.660 --> 01:11:25.700]  everyone that's allowed to go to Dealey Plaza for the 50th anniversary and that
[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:31.340]  no alternative will be you know you have to believe Oswald did it they're not
[01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:36.900]  going to allow anyone in the plaza who believes otherwise so you're right this
[01:11:36.900 --> 01:11:43.180]  is like a North Korea honoring because dissension isn't going to be
[01:11:43.180 --> 01:11:50.100]  allowed a whole show that over 75% of Americans are better do not believe the
[01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:55.980]  Warren Commission I understand I haven't read it but Bill Riley's book on the
[01:11:55.980 --> 01:12:01.500]  Kennedy killing someone told me that he his scenario has Oswald doing it again
[01:12:01.500 --> 01:12:06.700]  that it's an Oswald only deal so you can see all the publicity coming out to
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:12.340]  promote the magic bullet than the Oswald and the Warren Commission story but
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:16.940]  any free-thinking person who's ever done any studying in this whatsoever even
[01:12:16.940 --> 01:12:21.920]  small it's a study of it we'll clearly see that the Warren report is completely
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:25.620]  fraudulent but well I know you don't fly and so that's really restricted your
[01:12:25.620 --> 01:12:29.420]  movement because you won't be grope by giggling TSA pervs asking for your
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:33.500]  autograph as I have personally witness governor Ventura joining us right now
[01:12:33.500 --> 01:12:37.580]  here on the Alex Jones show he's just tuned in but I will pay for your train
[01:12:37.580 --> 01:12:42.500]  ticket or I'll pay for your RV gas no but listen I want to get you back down
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:50.620]  to Texas let's just say it right now if you're able you know coming up 11 and a
[01:12:50.620 --> 01:12:55.340]  half months from now let's be there and even if they hold us back it'll only
[01:12:55.340 --> 01:12:59.060]  blow up in their face I predict they're gonna cave in and it will all be there
[01:12:59.060 --> 01:13:04.940]  with a peaceful demonstration exposing it down the street well like I said you
[01:13:04.940 --> 01:13:09.220]  know powering any unforeseen circumstances I'd love to be down there you
[01:13:09.220 --> 01:13:13.980]  know what I'll rent a hotel I'll rent a hotel ballroom and then we'll have a
[01:13:13.980 --> 01:13:18.020]  whole JFK conference and have speeches and everything that's it we're all right
[01:13:18.020 --> 01:13:20.980]  we're doing it unless you were you know you got a family issue or something
[01:13:20.980 --> 01:13:24.880]  that it's on absolutely because I'm outraged over that Alex they've never
[01:13:24.880 --> 01:13:30.460]  bothered to show up at Dele Plaza any other year it's always been the people
[01:13:30.460 --> 01:13:35.220]  that don't believe the Warren Commission to show up there and now all of a
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:39.380]  sudden on the 50th anniversary they're going to keep us out of there and they're
[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:43.700]  going to open it up to only those that support the Warren Commission of Oz where
[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:48.980]  the loan did its scenario and it's just absurd because as I said anyone that does
[01:13:48.980 --> 01:13:54.020]  even a little bit of studying on this it becomes clear to you right away that
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:58.380]  Oswald certainly didn't act alone in fact I'm of the belief today after meeting
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:03.740]  with Judith Harry Baker that we Oswald who's a hero we Oswald saved Kennedy's
[01:14:03.740 --> 01:14:08.460]  life in Chicago there were three places we were going to hit Kennedy Miami
[01:14:08.460 --> 01:14:12.860]  Chicago I've talked to the black secret service agent he hadn't come on area but
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:16.900]  I talked to him through Jim Mars who was actually there and also help the oh
[01:14:16.900 --> 01:14:19.860]  that's all backed up not just by her when we're gonna air our interview
[01:14:19.860 --> 01:14:22.980]  whether tonight on the info watch not only knows that McBrain did a few weeks
[01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:27.100]  ago just been adding documents but just to back you and her up it came out in
[01:14:27.100 --> 01:14:29.740]  different documents that have been declassified his name connected to the
[01:14:29.740 --> 01:14:35.900]  CIA high-level spy base YouTube base in Japan he was allowed to defect as deep
[01:14:35.900 --> 01:14:40.700]  cover absolutely he was a guy trying to blow the whistle that's why they had to
[01:14:40.700 --> 01:14:46.540]  get rid of him well he also knew about the the fast-moving cancer because he
[01:14:46.540 --> 01:14:50.780]  was working on that with Judith in an attempt to kill Katz he said I'm a Patsy
[01:14:50.780 --> 01:14:55.020]  that's why they had to kill him he was a he was the logical target because
[01:14:55.020 --> 01:14:58.980]  number one he knew too much and they had to kill him for that reason and number
[01:14:58.980 --> 01:15:03.420]  two they set him up and he fit the scenario in the end where he could be
[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:08.820]  that long not to be portrayed as he was in our history books which is a complete
[01:15:08.820 --> 01:15:13.220]  lie governor you know why they're doing this I've seen literally in the last
[01:15:13.220 --> 01:15:17.540]  decade hundreds of scientific polls we've done reports showing you know many
[01:15:17.540 --> 01:15:23.460]  of them at the same time between 88 and 92% is in the average zone the the
[01:15:23.460 --> 01:15:29.820]  lowest level that don't buy into it's around 80% so when you've got on average
[01:15:29.820 --> 01:15:34.940]  about 10% of people that by the official story their whole facade caves in with
[01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:40.180]  that they're desperate to prop it up why would the government take over the whole
[01:15:40.180 --> 01:15:44.140]  area and say only official story allowed
[01:15:44.140 --> 01:15:51.140]  well obviously because you know they don't know the government will never admit what really happened
[01:15:51.140 --> 01:15:55.820]  it is still the crime of the century no matter what anyone says because I've
[01:15:55.820 --> 01:15:59.940]  always believed this if you can murder the president and get away with it what
[01:15:59.940 --> 01:16:05.380]  can't you do you can get away with anything then and so that's the reason
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:09.620]  it has to still be covered up and that's the reason the government will never
[01:16:09.620 --> 01:16:14.740]  no matter what happens the government will stick to its original story because
[01:16:14.740 --> 01:16:19.580]  if they ever admitted that there were people and let me add to this another
[01:16:19.580 --> 01:16:23.780]  book people need to read not only Judas book but they need to read St. John
[01:16:23.780 --> 01:16:47.300]  Hunt's book I agree we need to get St. John's book because when you put those two books together along with J.F.K. our Douglas is J.F.K. in the unspeakable and Jim Mars book and a few books like that you read those four books you'll get the real scenario of what pretty much went down and what it was really all about and where it led why it happened you know if Kennedy
[01:16:47.300 --> 01:17:00.420]  hadn't been killed they wouldn't have been a Vietnam War the Cold War would have been probably over by the mid 60s imagine the different country we would live in today if that one event had never happened
[01:17:00.420 --> 01:17:05.300]  it was a military industrial complex CIA foreign banking coup and the same people are in
[01:17:05.300 --> 01:17:09.220]  charge today you know Bruce Willis and I was even told about this before he was in
[01:17:09.220 --> 01:17:14.260]  Vanity Fair by Rick Linklater when he was here making a film with him he saw some
[01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:17.740]  of my films and woke up and then Bruce Willis made the statement the same guys
[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:21.820]  that killed Kennedy are running the country today and and that's really it
[01:17:21.820 --> 01:17:25.980]  that we're under a CIA coup
[01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:44.220]  you know it may be even be beyond them but it may be somebody who runs them to the CIA I don't know who knows at that level but certainly you know if people are it's just ridiculous Alex that the government is going to take this thing over and you're going to have to be ticketed to get
[01:17:44.220 --> 01:17:57.540]  to D. Lee Plyes with issue with the correct ticket maybe I'll apply for a ticket do you think they'd give me one I think you should do it but but separately be there and and you know we'll have our own demonstration down the street but Dallas is still you know
[01:17:57.540 --> 01:18:02.180]  somewhat of a free area my hometown maybe Glenn Beck who's moved to Texas and and it's
[01:18:02.180 --> 01:18:07.260]  following me around maybe you know oh but I forgot he he's busy bashing Ron Paul all
[01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:12.100]  day but then glomming on the vents of on a Ron Paul fan side issue it's just that
[01:18:12.100 --> 01:18:15.540]  yes we'll go up to Dallas we'll do it we're going to be there shift in years
[01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:23.580]  we're going to break what do you make of Bob Costas on the last Sunday not this
[01:18:23.580 --> 01:18:28.820]  Sunday but last Sunday's game coming out and blaming the second amendment for
[01:18:28.820 --> 01:18:34.180]  what that guy did all hopped up on drugs and now the USA Day headline Cowboys
[01:18:34.180 --> 01:18:38.780]  mole device to immobilize players cars just all of them guilty because one guy
[01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:44.860]  flipped a car and then Costas went on different TV shows and said men 20 to 30
[01:18:44.860 --> 01:18:50.260]  can't be aren't can't be trusted to own guns period well first of all that's the
[01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:56.060]  liberal side of the takeover their job is to decide the liberal point of view is
[01:18:56.060 --> 01:19:00.900]  that we shouldn't have guns they should all be taken away and my argument simple
[01:19:00.900 --> 01:19:07.780]  on that Alex Mexico is a country that doesn't allow guns do I need to say
[01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:14.340]  anything more well I think 50,000 Mexicans were killed last year in the
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:19.540]  room on drugs because they can't defend themselves they're not allowed to have
[01:19:19.540 --> 01:19:24.620]  drugs and it clear I mean guns and it clearly shows the old that the old
[01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:29.420]  cliche if you take away the guns from the people that only the bad guys are
[01:19:29.420 --> 01:19:36.100]  gonna have them and Mexico's the clear example of that thought process if the
[01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:40.980]  simple argument is to tell people Mexico doesn't allow drugs or guns and
[01:19:40.980 --> 01:19:45.540]  look at the mess down there and they've got drugs ban that's also itself in
[01:19:45.540 --> 01:19:48.900]  destroying them let's come back and elaborate on that talk about the TV
[01:19:48.900 --> 01:19:54.580]  show straight ahead and I can get that email from the Atlantic magazine to and

[01:23:14.260 --> 01:23:18.340]  we've ever known in fact just a few weeks ago former Speaker of the House
[01:23:18.340 --> 01:23:22.100]  Newt Gingrich wrote an op-ed piece to the Washington Post warning about this
[01:23:22.100 --> 01:23:26.620]  deadly threat I can't believe that more people aren't talking about this it may
[01:23:26.620 --> 01:23:29.540]  be because the liberals and the government are trying to cover it up
[01:23:29.540 --> 01:23:34.740]  that's why my friend just created a free video at weird device calm that

[01:24:23.700 --> 01:24:30.180]  okay here's Bob Costas on NBC said the same thing on Fox as well saying that
[01:24:30.180 --> 01:24:33.340]  basically football players can't be trusted to have guns and now they're
[01:24:33.340 --> 01:24:36.140]  saying the Dallas Morning News they want to make them all have breathalysers
[01:24:36.140 --> 01:24:39.900]  guilty until proven innocent when somebody else does something wrong if
[01:24:39.900 --> 01:24:43.740]  somebody in Texas kills somebody we're gonna make Jesse Ventura turn his guns
[01:24:43.740 --> 01:24:47.420]  in I mean that's just out of control let's go ahead and play this Bob Costas
[01:24:47.420 --> 01:24:51.980]  clip for the governor you can't have 65 guys in their 20s and 30s
[01:24:51.980 --> 01:24:58.180]  aggressive young men subject to impulses without something bad happening and I
[01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:01.620]  posed this question didn't have time to pose it on Sunday night but I'll pose it
[01:25:01.620 --> 01:25:07.860]  here give me one example of an athlete I know it's happened in society but give
[01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:13.740]  me one example of a professional athlete who by virtue of his having a gun took
[01:25:13.740 --> 01:25:17.620]  a dangerous situation and turned it around for the better let's stop right
[01:25:17.620 --> 01:25:21.020]  there Charles Bartlett's come out and said this is pure bull these are rich
[01:25:21.020 --> 01:25:25.300]  people their targets we found dozens of examples drudgereport.com link to our
[01:25:25.300 --> 01:25:29.780]  story last week of where NFL and other professionals have stopped home
[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:33.980]  invasions carjackings with guns governor you're you've been an athlete I mean
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:37.420]  the wrestling's hard one of the hardest sports out there many experts have said
[01:25:37.420 --> 01:25:42.980]  you've a governor all this stuff I mean this idea that that that that movie
[01:25:42.980 --> 01:25:46.660]  stars and people can't have a gun or that or that football players can't have a
[01:25:46.660 --> 01:25:50.900]  gun I mean that's why do we have 18 year olds with guns then in the military
[01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:56.140]  exactly I mean I find that a bit laughable when they when they tell you 20 to 30
[01:25:56.140 --> 01:25:59.660]  year olds shouldn't have a gun and you make the exact point Alex you can go
[01:25:59.660 --> 01:26:03.140]  into the military at 18 and you can kill for the government and there's no
[01:26:03.140 --> 01:26:10.260]  problem whatsoever in that aspect of it I guess Costas would put a little
[01:26:10.260 --> 01:26:16.820]  caveat there stating military does not count because if he feels that 20 to 30
[01:26:16.820 --> 01:26:21.460]  year olds should not have guns then therefore there can't be a 20 to 30 year
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:28.860]  old in the military but we see this more and more like with the TSA we're all
[01:26:28.860 --> 01:26:33.540]  guilty and then it turns out that the government's running Al Qaeda that was
[01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:38.940]  even in the New York Times finally yesterday we showed it earlier now the
[01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:45.100]  TSA is is fanning out on the streets what this idea of since one guy flipped
[01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:48.660]  his car drunk we're going to make all the NFL have breathalysers that's
[01:26:48.660 --> 01:26:53.660]  incredible authoritarianism I don't see where to never hold up Alex they have a
[01:26:53.660 --> 01:26:58.740]  collective bargaining agreement pretty well in the NFL is to add post-ports
[01:26:58.740 --> 01:27:04.100]  except wrestling they would have to it would have to be approved by the
[01:27:04.100 --> 01:27:09.580]  union and they're not going to approve some nonsense like that you know it
[01:27:09.580 --> 01:27:15.260]  selective they're doing it selectively if they can alienate and ban certain
[01:27:15.260 --> 01:27:19.260]  people it's all part of a bigger picture to ban and put together and that's the
[01:27:19.260 --> 01:27:23.660]  way you erode it away by taking little portions and all of a sudden you're
[01:27:23.660 --> 01:27:27.340]  going to tell NFL football players they're not covered by the Second
[01:27:27.340 --> 01:27:31.020]  Amendment but they don't have Second Amendment rights well maybe they don't
[01:27:31.020 --> 01:27:36.380]  Alex because after all remember when I tried to go to court over the TSA I
[01:27:36.380 --> 01:27:41.000]  sued under the Fourth Amendment reasonable search and seizure and the
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:45.100]  federal judge threw it out of court stating she didn't have jurisdiction so
[01:27:45.100 --> 01:27:49.580]  you know at airports you're not covered by the by the Bill of Rights or the
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:54.940]  Constitution so this is just another part of them eroding it away bit by bit
[01:27:54.940 --> 01:27:59.660]  you know it's like anything you know water takes years to erode something away
[01:27:59.660 --> 01:28:04.540]  and it does it just slowly by every little grain of sand and that's what
[01:28:04.540 --> 01:28:08.140]  you've got happening here to our Constitution Bill of Rights not just
[01:28:08.140 --> 01:28:13.740]  the Second Amendment but other amendments to it also are being slowly eroded away
[01:28:13.740 --> 01:28:17.660]  until they don't exist anymore yes sir we're going to go to break you've got to
[01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:20.620]  go at 40 after and then I'll go to all the callers that are holding but let me
[01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:25.100]  raise this for you here the Atlantic Monthly reporter wants to know and I
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:27.540]  know you said I can handle it but I want to get your take on this he says
[01:28:27.540 --> 01:28:31.740]  conspiracy theory with Jesse Ventura you know what you know what happened with
[01:28:31.740 --> 01:28:36.840]  the FEMA show police state show and the TSA show and the question is you know is
[01:28:36.840 --> 01:28:41.820]  there a suppression of conspiracy theory what's your quote for Atlantic
[01:28:41.820 --> 01:29:05.820]  Monthly magazine
[01:29:05.820 --> 01:29:33.820]  not to Eric so somebody on their end has made that decision who made that decision I do not know I can only say the true TV the network did who influenced the network not to do that show or not to Eric I do not know that you know but all I can tell you is absolutely we've been censored absolutely shows have not been shown and shows have been taken off after they've been shown only one time
[01:29:33.820 --> 01:29:49.820]  that's right we'll come back and talk about it is we'll be right back and get into the TV show itself and a little more with Jesse Ventura stay with us
[01:29:49.820 --> 01:29:59.820]  we're on the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:32.820]  I was just telling Jesse and Governor Ventura during the break man the best conversation is during the breaks and he said I'll say it when we come on air recap in the words you use during the break as you put it perfectly what's happening with Dealey Plaza and the censorship and the free speech zones and all the rest of it and then I want to finish up with the TV show
[01:33:32.820 --> 01:33:46.820]  because I know when I talk to this reporter he'll go well it did air once yeah well they air the others about 50 times over the next year and they pulled the TSA I mean it's all part of this story of more and more censorship and control go ahead and make your point on that
[01:33:46.820 --> 01:34:07.820]  Well the big thing on Dealey Plaza what irritates me is for 49 years it's been us conspirators who have rallied there on the murder of Kennedy's birthday on the anniversary I should say of Kennedy's murder it's been the conspiracy people who do not believe Osweal back to the law or do not believe Osweal back to the law
[01:34:07.820 --> 01:34:27.820]  who have done this 49 out of the 50 years now all of a sudden on the 50th year we're not allowed to be there and only the poor Osweal, poor government, poor law and commission people are allowed in Dealey Plaza after 49 years they ignored it they paid no attention to it whatsoever
[01:34:27.820 --> 01:34:48.820]  and here on the big 50th anniversary we're banned and they're going to be allowed to be there I think that's unconscionable and outrageous and Alex you're on the right deal let's protest it let's get the masses everybody that does not believe the law and commission should be there this coming year to protest government censorship
[01:34:48.820 --> 01:35:04.820]  We've got a year we can get thousands out there ladies and gentlemen governor I believe in fact I know this is going to blow up in their face I want your take on that the attempt to take that big giant plaza with three big roads I mean you haven't been there it's a big triangle folks
[01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:24.820]  that's always just overrun with researchers and scientists and photographers that work for life like Groden and just all these people there breaking down the facts I mean you go down there sometimes and Oliver Stone's been there at anniversaries and others and now and I've been there at probably six or seven of them or more than that
[01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:37.820]  imagine well I was there once when I was a kid my parents took me down there on the anniversary so the point I'm from Dallas it's amazing that they would say in America we're going to shut down downtown and you can't be there unless you agree with us
[01:35:37.820 --> 01:35:59.820]  Yeah you can't be there unless you agree with us and you're ticketed because I heard they're going to issue tickets so that you're going to have to have the required ticket to get past the barricades to be at Dealey Plaza and I'm sure this year they'll have all these speakers will be there speaking and pointing to that Texas bookstore depository window
[01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:08.820]  saying that's where the bullets were fired and they'll ignore of course the ticket fence or the grass we know where the fatal headshot was indeed fired from
[01:36:08.820 --> 01:36:22.820]  Well that's what's really going on is that the fellow who used to be a conspiracy person who knew the truth he was the one given control of the school buck building that has that ridiculous museum and I know you've been in and covered
[01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:25.820]  Are you talking about Billy Mack?
[01:36:25.820 --> 01:36:35.820]  Yes well remember now on my TV show Billy Mack admitted on the TV show that it was his personal opinion that was more than I was well involved
[01:36:35.820 --> 01:36:45.820]  Incredible but exactly now he's the one who's going to be allowed to run the entire thing and block citizens from entering the park I mean it's just
[01:36:45.820 --> 01:36:50.820]  Let's remember something let's not put it all on Billy Mack it's bigger than him
[01:36:50.820 --> 01:36:51.820]  Of course
[01:36:51.820 --> 01:37:06.820]  This happens to be the guy that runs the museum who did the purpose to lead skateboard to do this but always remember we got it out of him on my TV show that he personally personally does not necessarily believe the official story
[01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:15.820]  I know it's an amazing look he has on his face for those that haven't seen the JFK episode which I think is one of the best where he kind of smiles and has a twinkle in his eye
[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:22.820]  Because Jim Mars is on him forever he used to be one of the guys out there protesting and they came and got him and made him the head
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:34.820]  That's the classic Judas story just amazing no I'm certainly not saying he's the progenitor of all this my point is that that facility that group is taking control the whole thing
[01:37:34.820 --> 01:37:42.820]  Did you see this year on the 11th anniversary of 9-11 they barred the police and firemen from the pit because so many of them are 9-11 truthers governor
[01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:51.820]  Yeah no I saw that too you know welcome to America if you're gonna go for something today you better have the government's line or you're not gonna be allowed there
[01:37:51.820 --> 01:38:03.820]  You know we should understand that when people should not be shocked because when the last street protesters were out there they were simply protesting don't buy and sell last street
[01:38:03.820 --> 01:38:15.820]  You know don't own our politicians last street and they were run off with pepper spray and dogs and you know scattered to the wind so you need to understand that in the United States of America today
[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:22.820]  You do not have your freedom anymore you do not have the freedom to assemble you do not have the freedom to protest your government
[01:38:22.820 --> 01:38:37.820]  You're still not given habeas corpus if they arrest you you're not guaranteed a lawyer in a trial anymore this is not the country that I grew up in Alex it's far different today than what it was when I was young
[01:38:37.820 --> 01:38:49.820]  Well you're gonna be going south to Mexico be safe doing that in a couple weeks your last visit with us while you're gone for four or five months to get out of the Arctic blow there in beautiful Minnesota with your wife
[01:38:49.820 --> 01:38:55.820]  Alex it could be my last visit to the US you never know I could go to Mexico and never come back
[01:38:55.820 --> 01:39:03.820]  In fact you're given some inside baseball what was it four or five years ago you almost decided to kill Jesse Ventura
[01:39:03.820 --> 01:39:13.820]  No no no no no no no but I just always remember when I crossed the border and go down into Mexico there's always the chance that I will not return
[01:39:13.820 --> 01:39:21.820]  Well wait I mean not technically you know you yourself as you said would never commit suicide if something happens I'm saying you told me
[01:39:21.820 --> 01:39:23.820]  No no no no no
[01:39:23.820 --> 01:39:25.820]  You said you thought about riding off into the sunset
[01:39:25.820 --> 01:39:29.820]  I knew I would ride off into the sunset absolutely at some point
[01:39:29.820 --> 01:39:31.820]  No but you told me
[01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:35.820]  It could be in two months Alex I could go across the border and you'll never hear from me again
[01:39:35.820 --> 01:39:38.820]  No no no you may have forgotten you told me this you said you almost ended
[01:39:38.820 --> 01:39:43.820]  I'm telling you because I don't want you to talk about it you're not getting the hint
[01:39:43.820 --> 01:39:45.820]  Oh okay never mind
[01:39:45.820 --> 01:39:47.820]  Oh I thought I don't want to ever like I'm a
[01:39:47.820 --> 01:39:50.820]  How many times do I have to circle talk to you before it sinks in
[01:39:50.820 --> 01:39:54.820]  Alright shifting gears and closing I'm sorry
[01:39:54.820 --> 01:39:59.820]  Okay side issue anyways let's just get back to what we were saying
[01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:03.820]  What's the how many more episodes of the show are going to air
[01:40:03.820 --> 01:40:09.820]  We did eight of them they're going to air seven I don't know what are they on now four or five
[01:40:09.820 --> 01:40:11.820]  Yeah so I guess about
[01:40:11.820 --> 01:40:19.820]  There will be seven of them will air even though we did eight we did the TSA one but that's not going to see the light of day
[01:40:19.820 --> 01:40:31.820]  And that's the one you can talk about to Atlantic magazine because we completed it we finished it and it's their call but the public will not see it
[01:40:31.820 --> 01:40:37.820]  Absolutely well maybe if we put pressure on it then they will air it
[01:40:37.820 --> 01:40:39.820]  I doubt it but you can try
[01:40:39.820 --> 01:40:44.820]  Alright in closing here you're going to visit with us one more time Monday and then you're going to ride off into the sunset
[01:40:44.820 --> 01:40:49.820]  At least for the winter well I hope you don't well you're not riding off in the sunset until
[01:40:49.820 --> 01:40:53.820]  I mean you've got to go to Dealey Plaza maybe that's where if you decide to shove off into the sunset
[01:40:53.820 --> 01:40:55.820]  I mean you've got to come to Dealey Plaza this year
[01:40:55.820 --> 01:41:00.820]  I guess you're going to let the globalists have Dealey Plaza though
[01:41:00.820 --> 01:41:02.820]  I don't know
[01:41:02.820 --> 01:41:10.820]  It all depends what I decide to do like I said there will come a day where I may not even come back to the country I may stay gone
[01:41:10.820 --> 01:41:15.820]  I don't know I can't tell you what the future holds Alex I'm not a sous-sainter
[01:41:15.820 --> 01:41:21.820]  I hear you well and they're changing the days the show airs I guess it's now Monday's the new day
[01:41:21.820 --> 01:41:27.820]  Yeah Monday's I guess unless they changed it again they've changed it but they showed it once on Wednesday and then they
[01:41:27.820 --> 01:41:32.820]  They changed the time on Wednesday and then the third show they showed on Monday
[01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:37.820]  So I guess we're on Monday now unless they shift us back to Wednesday again I don't know
[01:41:37.820 --> 01:41:41.820]  I'm not sure what's going on with the show
[01:41:41.820 --> 01:41:46.820]  Alright well I'm going to play a clip here and say bye to you all fair and we'll see you at noon next Monday
[01:41:46.820 --> 01:41:48.820]  Okay Alex we'll talk to you next Monday at noon
[01:41:48.820 --> 01:41:50.820]  Thank you let's go to that clip
[01:41:51.820 --> 01:41:54.820]  And I got a movie coming out Django check it out
[01:41:54.820 --> 01:41:57.820]  You know the Caprio
[01:41:57.820 --> 01:41:59.820]  Samuel Jackson
[01:41:59.820 --> 01:42:02.820]  Django Unchained I play a slave
[01:42:02.820 --> 01:42:04.820]  How black is that?
[01:42:04.820 --> 01:42:07.820]  And in the movie I have to word change
[01:42:07.820 --> 01:42:10.820]  How wack is that?
[01:42:10.820 --> 01:42:13.820]  But don't be worried about it because I get out to change
[01:42:13.820 --> 01:42:18.820]  I get free I save my wife and I kill all the white people in the movie
[01:42:20.820 --> 01:42:22.820]  How great is that?
[01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:24.820]  And how black is that?
[01:42:24.820 --> 01:42:26.820]  But I'm going to tell you right now speaking of blackness
[01:42:26.820 --> 01:42:28.820]  My president
[01:42:28.820 --> 01:42:32.820]  President Obama's back up in the White House four more years
[01:42:35.820 --> 01:42:37.820]  How black is that?
[01:42:37.820 --> 01:42:41.820]  And not only that he's so black he was playing basketball during the election day
[01:42:41.820 --> 01:42:44.820]  How black is that?
[01:42:44.820 --> 01:42:47.820]  But he was also late for his acceptance speech
[01:42:47.820 --> 01:42:50.820]  Okay all the white people this your turn
[01:42:50.820 --> 01:42:52.820]  How black is that?
[01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:55.820]  But he's going to be extra black this next four years
[01:42:55.820 --> 01:42:57.820]  He's going to get everything black
[01:42:57.820 --> 01:43:00.820]  And white people don't get nervous about that because he is mixed
[01:43:00.820 --> 01:43:04.820]  Now the first four years was the white side of him
[01:43:04.820 --> 01:43:07.820]  Because I don't know if you saw him on Ellen when he was dancing and everything
[01:43:07.820 --> 01:43:09.820]  I don't know what this is
[01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:15.820]  That wasn't President Obama
[01:43:15.820 --> 01:43:18.820]  That was President Barry Gibb Obama
[01:43:18.820 --> 01:43:20.820]  Alright that's enough
[01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:24.820]  By the way in England they arrest you if you're white and use the n-word
[01:43:24.820 --> 01:43:26.820]  I mean there's no free speech
[01:43:26.820 --> 01:43:29.820]  But then in the culture it's pumped out constantly
[01:43:29.820 --> 01:43:32.820]  And you could say he's doing a comedy routine
[01:43:32.820 --> 01:43:35.820]  He has said our Lord and Savior Obama
[01:43:35.820 --> 01:43:38.820]  And it's just injecting racial division
[01:43:38.820 --> 01:43:41.820]  I mean if you watch Slimeball with Chris
[01:43:43.820 --> 01:43:46.820]  Matties or whatever his name in and Mr. Manow and all those guys
[01:43:46.820 --> 01:43:49.820]  If you watch that stuff
[01:43:49.820 --> 01:43:52.820]  All they do is just
[01:43:52.820 --> 01:43:55.820]  You don't like gun control you're a racist
[01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:58.820]  That's what that Fox sports writer said
[01:43:58.820 --> 01:44:01.820]  You know we got to ban the guns and anybody that owns the guns KKK
[01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:03.820]  I mean it's amazing
[01:44:03.820 --> 01:44:06.820]  Oh you don't like government run healthcare you're a racist
[01:44:06.820 --> 01:44:10.820]  And what they've done is taught white people to be totally guilty
[01:44:10.820 --> 01:44:12.820]  Mindless obsessed with everything they say
[01:44:12.820 --> 01:44:14.820]  Pay more taxes you're a racist
[01:44:14.820 --> 01:44:16.820]  Jump off that cliff you're a racist
[01:44:16.820 --> 01:44:18.820]  Oh yes sir I'll do it right now
[01:44:18.820 --> 01:44:22.820]  And then meanwhile trying to get all the other quote minority groups all hyped up and racially based
[01:44:22.820 --> 01:44:24.820]  So they can be government controlled
[01:44:24.820 --> 01:44:27.820]  Meanwhile
[01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:30.820]  The government is absolutely
[01:44:30.820 --> 01:44:33.820]  Hell bent on destroying the black community in this country in every other community
[01:44:33.820 --> 01:44:36.820]  And to watch Jamie Fox who is
[01:44:36.820 --> 01:44:39.820]  An absolute servant of the New World Order
[01:44:39.820 --> 01:44:41.820]  Getting off on it it's so much fun
[01:44:41.820 --> 01:44:44.820]  I mean people actually oh yeah the black people are winning
[01:44:44.820 --> 01:44:47.820]  Because there's a black president I mean it's like idiot Republicans
[01:44:47.820 --> 01:44:49.820]  We're winning because there's a Republican in the White House
[01:44:49.820 --> 01:44:52.820]  While the agenda moves forward
[01:44:52.820 --> 01:44:55.820]  Obama is a total puppet of the globalist
[01:44:55.820 --> 01:44:58.820]  And they have got their program accelerated
[01:44:58.820 --> 01:45:01.820]  And you can see the divide and conquer Balkanization politics
[01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:04.820]  They plan to use
[01:45:04.820 --> 01:45:10.820]  Well I'll tell you that was a cliffhanger with Ventura
[01:45:10.820 --> 01:45:14.820]  Where I think he's actually on air before
[01:45:14.820 --> 01:45:17.820]  Said the story he was saying
[01:45:17.820 --> 01:45:20.820]  About retiring from public life
[01:45:20.820 --> 01:45:23.820]  And then I couldn't understand it I'm like no you did tell me that
[01:45:23.820 --> 01:45:25.820]  No you did tell me that
[01:45:25.820 --> 01:45:28.820]  I'm not gonna shit up here like I'm making something up
[01:45:28.820 --> 01:45:30.820]  I think he was in a grumpy mood today
[01:45:30.820 --> 01:45:32.820]  You know Jesse's bummed out I'm gonna tell you right now about the whole world
[01:45:32.820 --> 01:45:34.820]  He really freaks him out
[01:45:34.820 --> 01:45:36.820]  That's why I like Jesse Ventura he's a real guy
[01:45:36.820 --> 01:45:39.820]  And he's upset about the police state
[01:45:39.820 --> 01:45:42.820]  He's upset about that
[01:45:42.820 --> 01:45:44.820]  Navy shield guy you know making that stuff up
[01:45:44.820 --> 01:45:47.820]  And he is suing him right now and boy does Jesse
[01:45:47.820 --> 01:45:49.820]  Have all the goods on the guy
[01:45:49.820 --> 01:45:52.820]  The guy doesn't have one witness and Jesse has his
[01:45:52.820 --> 01:45:55.820]  Not one person can come forward and say that happened in a packed bar
[01:45:55.820 --> 01:46:02.820]  And you know Jesse is
[01:46:02.820 --> 01:46:05.820]  He gets bummed out I met him seven years ago
[01:46:05.820 --> 01:46:06.820]  And he wasn't like that the more he
[01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:08.820]  So many times like that can't be true Alex
[01:46:08.820 --> 01:46:10.820]  It's not that bad and he's like it's true
[01:46:10.820 --> 01:46:12.820]  Like I was talking to him last week off air and he goes
[01:46:12.820 --> 01:46:15.820]  Yeah the cancer virus is what was on a break on Mancow show
[01:46:15.820 --> 01:46:18.820]  And he's like yeah no I didn't believe that
[01:46:18.820 --> 01:46:21.820]  No it's seen all the proof that they do that to people
[01:46:21.820 --> 01:46:23.820]  Oh I mean it is a bummer
[01:46:23.820 --> 01:46:25.820]  But you know what we've got to realize
[01:46:25.820 --> 01:46:28.820]  That we can get the word out to people
[01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:31.820]  And we can change all this
[01:46:31.820 --> 01:46:34.820]  We can get the word out and change it
[01:46:34.820 --> 01:46:36.820]  We've faced a lot of bad things before
[01:46:36.820 --> 01:46:38.820]  And you know that's the problem a lot of people you wake them up
[01:46:38.820 --> 01:46:40.820]  And they get really bummed out
[01:46:40.820 --> 01:46:42.820]  And they just want to go hide in the middle of nowhere
[01:46:42.820 --> 01:46:45.820]  And I don't blame people that are above 60 year old
[01:46:45.820 --> 01:46:47.820]  You know doing that but
[01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:49.820]  There's nowhere to go if we don't turn this around
[01:46:49.820 --> 01:46:52.820]  And I understand when people hear this show and they think
[01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:56.820]  Man this is over the top
[01:46:56.820 --> 01:47:00.820]  But reality is over the top
[01:47:00.820 --> 01:47:05.820]  I mean I wish this wasn't happening
[01:47:05.820 --> 01:47:07.820]  I wish it wasn't real but it is
[01:47:07.820 --> 01:47:09.820]  Let's go to your calls
[01:47:09.820 --> 01:47:11.820]  David in FEMA reason 4
[01:47:11.820 --> 01:47:13.820]  You want to talk about the Chinese president
[01:47:13.820 --> 01:47:15.820]  Not sure what that is but go ahead you're on the air
[01:47:15.820 --> 01:47:17.820]  David thanks for holding
[01:47:17.820 --> 01:47:19.820]  Hey Alex pleasure man
[01:47:19.820 --> 01:47:22.820]  You know it's funny how I found you
[01:47:22.820 --> 01:47:24.820]  I typed in the inner world and I found you
[01:47:24.820 --> 01:47:26.820]  And then I was telling all my buddies about it
[01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:28.820]  Who were in the military and stuff
[01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:30.820]  And they said oh we already knew about Alex
[01:47:30.820 --> 01:47:32.820]  So why didn't you tell me about it
[01:47:32.820 --> 01:47:36.820]  But anyway yeah I watched CNBC in the mornings
[01:47:36.820 --> 01:47:39.820]  Every morning and they always put out a lot of information
[01:47:39.820 --> 01:47:42.820]  And I saw that two weeks ago they said
[01:47:42.820 --> 01:47:45.820]  That the Chinese president is going to come up again
[01:47:45.820 --> 01:47:48.820]  And the world banks in charge
[01:47:48.820 --> 01:47:50.820]  Are who gets to go in that country
[01:47:50.820 --> 01:47:55.820]  That's right and of course you saw that on CNBC
[01:47:55.820 --> 01:47:58.820]  The world bank now decides who becomes the prime minister
[01:47:58.820 --> 01:48:01.820]  Of Greece who becomes the president of Italy
[01:48:01.820 --> 01:48:04.820]  They're in charge of who becomes the leader of
[01:48:04.820 --> 01:48:08.820]  The bank in England who the leader of Ireland is
[01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:10.820]  I mean they're running the whole world
[01:48:10.820 --> 01:48:12.820]  And bragging about it
[01:48:12.820 --> 01:48:15.820]  I know I know it's insane
[01:48:15.820 --> 01:48:18.820]  And you know what's really sad is
[01:48:18.820 --> 01:48:20.820]  What's wrong with the American people
[01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:22.820]  Everybody sees this I got a gun show
[01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:24.820]  They're all stocking up for this
[01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:26.820]  But nobody's talking about what solution
[01:48:26.820 --> 01:48:28.820]  We should be out there protesting big time
[01:48:28.820 --> 01:48:30.820]  There should be two million people
[01:48:30.820 --> 01:48:32.820]  Three million people right now if they want to send
[01:48:32.820 --> 01:48:34.820]  DC protests what's going on
[01:48:34.820 --> 01:48:36.820]  And ain't nobody knowing that we're just sitting back
[01:48:36.820 --> 01:48:38.820]  Like well we'll see who fires the first shot
[01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:43.820]  Yeah everybody well that's another cop out
[01:48:43.820 --> 01:48:45.820]  Saying we're going to be raptured
[01:48:45.820 --> 01:48:47.820]  Saying 2012 is the end of the world in ten days
[01:48:47.820 --> 01:48:48.820]  It's a cop out
[01:48:48.820 --> 01:48:50.820]  Oh well I'll just you know people are like
[01:48:50.820 --> 01:48:52.820]  Well the UN comes you know if the UN comes to my house
[01:48:52.820 --> 01:48:53.820]  It won't be UN
[01:48:53.820 --> 01:48:55.820]  It'll be US troops mixed in with foreigners
[01:48:55.820 --> 01:48:57.820]  Under a US banner
[01:48:57.820 --> 01:48:58.820]  That's what they train to do
[01:48:58.820 --> 01:49:00.820]  Literally hundreds of training ops
[01:49:00.820 --> 01:49:02.820]  We've documented dozens we've been to
[01:49:02.820 --> 01:49:03.820]  It's a cop out
[01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:05.820]  Well I'll just wait here in my farmhouse
[01:49:05.820 --> 01:49:07.820]  Anybody messes with me I'm going to
[01:49:07.820 --> 01:49:09.820]  And then you wait until you run up to a cop checkpoint
[01:49:09.820 --> 01:49:11.820]  And a lot of these old guys do go out and shoot the cops
[01:49:11.820 --> 01:49:13.820]  Why don't you go shoot the cops with information
[01:49:13.820 --> 01:49:14.820]  At the police station
[01:49:14.820 --> 01:49:16.820]  Why don't you bug them at the coffee shop
[01:49:16.820 --> 01:49:18.820]  Bug them at the bar
[01:49:18.820 --> 01:49:19.820]  Give them info
[01:49:19.820 --> 01:49:20.820]  Shake their hands
[01:49:20.820 --> 01:49:21.820]  Wake them up
[01:49:21.820 --> 01:49:22.820]  Get them on our side
[01:49:22.820 --> 01:49:24.820]  Instead of talking about how you're just going to kill them
[01:49:24.820 --> 01:49:25.820]  Because let me tell you something
[01:49:25.820 --> 01:49:26.820]  That doesn't hurt the New World Order
[01:49:26.820 --> 01:49:27.820]  It makes me so angry
[01:49:27.820 --> 01:49:29.820]  We need to be absolutely
[01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:31.820]  On the military and police
[01:49:31.820 --> 01:49:33.820]  Hammering them with the truth right now
[01:49:33.820 --> 01:49:34.820]  You know these guys talk about how
[01:49:34.820 --> 01:49:35.820]  Well I'll just
[01:49:35.820 --> 01:49:36.820]  If they come for me
[01:49:36.820 --> 01:49:37.820]  I'll just shoot them
[01:49:37.820 --> 01:49:38.820]  And by the way people are playing
[01:49:38.820 --> 01:49:39.820]  That is going to happen more and more
[01:49:39.820 --> 01:49:41.820]  Cops get more and more scared of patriots
[01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:43.820]  And then that's how the war starts
[01:49:43.820 --> 01:49:45.820]  We need to be out waking them up
[01:49:45.820 --> 01:49:46.820]  Which is starting to happen
[01:49:46.820 --> 01:49:47.820]  So we don't have this civil war
[01:49:47.820 --> 01:49:49.820]  The globalist have planned
[01:49:49.820 --> 01:49:51.820]  Just like you just alluded to
[01:49:51.820 --> 01:49:53.820]  Last week I still don't have time
[01:49:53.820 --> 01:49:54.820]  Because we got so much video
[01:49:54.820 --> 01:49:55.820]  We're going to probably air it tonight
[01:49:55.820 --> 01:49:56.820]  On the nightly news
[01:49:56.820 --> 01:49:57.820]  If not we'll air it tomorrow on the radio
[01:49:57.820 --> 01:49:58.820]  You know where I went down
[01:49:58.820 --> 01:49:59.820]  And got in the face of the feds
[01:49:59.820 --> 01:50:01.820]  Down at the federal building
[01:50:01.820 --> 01:50:02.820]  Because they told my reporter
[01:50:02.820 --> 01:50:03.820]  She couldn't take photos
[01:50:03.820 --> 01:50:05.820]  I went down there and got in their face
[01:50:05.820 --> 01:50:06.820]  And had the federal police say
[01:50:06.820 --> 01:50:08.820]  Yes sir you're allowed to film this
[01:50:08.820 --> 01:50:10.820]  And look the government's the type
[01:50:10.820 --> 01:50:12.820]  So they'll come put something on me
[01:50:12.820 --> 01:50:13.820]  Or whatever
[01:50:13.820 --> 01:50:14.820]  Whatever
[01:50:14.820 --> 01:50:15.820]  You know what I'm not saying
[01:50:15.820 --> 01:50:16.820]  Bring it on because I'm macho
[01:50:16.820 --> 01:50:18.820]  I'm saying I got to do what I got to do
[01:50:18.820 --> 01:50:20.820]  You people are out of control
[01:50:20.820 --> 01:50:22.820]  I'm going to come up against you
[01:50:22.820 --> 01:50:23.820]  And if you strike me down
[01:50:23.820 --> 01:50:24.820]  Or set me up
[01:50:24.820 --> 01:50:26.820]  You got to deal with God
[01:50:26.820 --> 01:50:27.820]  Because let me tell you
[01:50:27.820 --> 01:50:28.820]  There's nobody more cursed
[01:50:28.820 --> 01:50:30.820]  Than people that serve evil against good
[01:50:30.820 --> 01:50:31.820]  I'll tell you right now
[01:50:31.820 --> 01:50:32.820]  And I can tell you
[01:50:32.820 --> 01:50:34.820]  I've put my entire future
[01:50:34.820 --> 01:50:36.820]  And soul and will and everything
[01:50:36.820 --> 01:50:38.820]  Into this and have just committed
[01:50:38.820 --> 01:50:39.820]  I don't have fear
[01:50:39.820 --> 01:50:40.820]  Not for my wife
[01:50:40.820 --> 01:50:41.820]  Not for my children
[01:50:41.820 --> 01:50:42.820]  Nothing
[01:50:42.820 --> 01:50:43.820]  Believe me I love my children
[01:50:43.820 --> 01:50:44.820]  So much I look in their eyes
[01:50:44.820 --> 01:50:45.820]  I start crying
[01:50:45.820 --> 01:50:46.820]  And it's because I love them
[01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:48.820]  That I am totally committing myself
[01:50:48.820 --> 01:50:50.820]  Them and everything to this fight
[01:50:50.820 --> 01:50:51.820]  Anything else sir
[01:50:51.820 --> 01:50:53.820]  I'm sorry I'm ranting David
[01:50:53.820 --> 01:50:54.820]  Have you seen Michael Lubert
[01:50:54.820 --> 01:50:56.820]  The real truth of 9-11
[01:50:56.820 --> 01:50:57.820]  Have you seen his film
[01:50:57.820 --> 01:50:58.820]  Yes it's a good film
[01:50:58.820 --> 01:51:24.820]  We'll be right back
[01:51:28.820 --> 01:51:54.820]  We'll be right back
[01:51:54.820 --> 01:52:20.820]  We'll be right back
[01:52:20.820 --> 01:52:46.820]  We'll be right back

[01:53:12.820 --> 01:53:38.820]  We'll be right back
[01:53:38.820 --> 01:54:05.820]  We are on the march
[01:54:05.820 --> 01:54:08.820]  The Empire is on the run
[01:54:08.820 --> 01:54:21.820]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network

[01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:34.820]  Of 10 reasons why it's not
[01:54:34.820 --> 01:54:37.820]  The end of the world as we know it
[01:54:37.820 --> 01:54:39.820]  Media indulges in debunked hysteria
[01:54:39.820 --> 01:54:42.820]  While ignoring real crisis
[01:54:42.820 --> 01:54:43.820]  Article that Paul Watson and I
[01:54:43.820 --> 01:54:46.820]  Have worked on the last two weeks

[01:54:49.820 --> 01:54:51.820]  And prisonpana.com

[01:55:10.820 --> 01:55:11.820]  Over the ten years

[01:55:13.820 --> 01:55:14.820]  Ten years in April
[01:55:14.820 --> 01:55:16.820]  You know it's had some problems
[01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:17.820]  But the last year or two
[01:55:17.820 --> 01:55:19.820]  It's just been smoking hot
[01:55:19.820 --> 01:55:21.820]  Working really great
[01:55:21.820 --> 01:55:22.820]  World class
[01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:23.820]  It's about to get super world class
[01:55:23.820 --> 01:55:25.820]  Next week
[01:55:25.820 --> 01:55:26.820]  So prisonplanet.tv
[01:55:26.820 --> 01:55:28.820]  You can get ten memberships
[01:55:28.820 --> 01:55:29.820]  For $5.95 a month
[01:55:29.820 --> 01:55:32.820]  That's $0.59 a person per month
[01:55:32.820 --> 01:55:33.820]  Ladies and gentlemen
[01:55:33.820 --> 01:55:34.820]  You cannot beat that deal
[01:55:34.820 --> 01:55:36.820]  You go create a new username and
[01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:37.820]  Passcode
[01:55:37.820 --> 01:55:38.820]  Pay your $5.95
[01:55:38.820 --> 01:55:41.820]  Takes about a minute to sign up
[01:55:41.820 --> 01:55:42.820]  And then you get ten people
[01:55:42.820 --> 01:55:44.820]  Can log in with that username
[01:55:44.820 --> 01:55:45.820]  Passcode
[01:55:45.820 --> 01:55:46.820]  Simultaneously
[01:55:46.820 --> 01:55:48.820]  Of course nobody will usually do
[01:55:48.820 --> 01:55:49.820]  That so it's more than ten
[01:55:49.820 --> 01:55:50.820]  Memberships and you just give it
[01:55:50.820 --> 01:55:52.820]  In an e-card as a gift
[01:55:52.820 --> 01:55:53.820]  Prisonplanet.tv
[01:55:53.820 --> 01:55:54.820]  Christmas shopping done
[01:55:54.820 --> 01:55:56.820]  Let's say you got thirty gifts
[01:55:56.820 --> 01:55:57.820]  You gotta give
[01:55:57.820 --> 01:55:58.820]  And they're adults
[01:55:58.820 --> 01:55:59.820]  The office or whatever
[01:55:59.820 --> 01:56:00.820]  Just create cards
[01:56:00.820 --> 01:56:02.820]  Print out a little sticker
[01:56:02.820 --> 01:56:03.820]  With the username passcode
[01:56:03.820 --> 01:56:05.820]  And say here is your documentary
[01:56:05.820 --> 01:56:07.820]  Film subscriber HD site
[01:56:07.820 --> 01:56:09.820]  Cause now we put a lot of stuff
[01:56:09.820 --> 01:56:10.820]  Up in HD
[01:56:10.820 --> 01:56:11.820]  Books, other films
[01:56:11.820 --> 01:56:13.820]  It's ridiculous
[01:56:13.820 --> 01:56:14.820]  Because we're being censored
[01:56:14.820 --> 01:56:15.820]  More and more
[01:56:15.820 --> 01:56:17.820]  Other places like YouTube
[01:56:17.820 --> 01:56:18.820]  That's why we've got it
[01:56:18.820 --> 01:56:20.820]  So I built it ten years ago
[01:56:20.820 --> 01:56:21.820]  So it's world class now
[01:56:21.820 --> 01:56:22.820]  And it's got a lot of new functions
[01:56:22.820 --> 01:56:24.820]  Coming in next week
[01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:26.820]  Prisonplanet.tv
[01:56:26.820 --> 01:56:28.820]  And you can get a yearly membership
[01:56:28.820 --> 01:56:30.820]  And get five point three months free
[01:56:30.820 --> 01:56:31.820]  Off the yearly price
[01:56:31.820 --> 01:56:32.820]  You can also do that
[01:56:32.820 --> 01:56:33.820]  But this month to month thing
[01:56:33.820 --> 01:56:34.820]  Where you get ten memberships
[01:56:34.820 --> 01:56:36.820]  Well the yearly you get ten
[01:56:36.820 --> 01:56:38.820]  For the price of the yearly actually
[01:56:38.820 --> 01:56:40.820]  I guess it's an even better deal actually
[01:56:40.820 --> 01:56:41.820]  Okay prisonplanet.tv
[01:56:41.820 --> 01:56:42.820]  There you go
[01:56:42.820 --> 01:56:44.820]  Pro pure water filters
[01:56:44.820 --> 01:56:45.820]  We can still get them to you by Christmas
[01:56:45.820 --> 01:56:46.820]  If you order today
[01:56:46.820 --> 01:56:48.820]  Maybe tomorrow but
[01:56:48.820 --> 01:56:50.820]  It looks like we may sell out
[01:56:50.820 --> 01:56:51.820]  In the next few days
[01:56:51.820 --> 01:56:52.820]  And then it'll
[01:56:52.820 --> 01:56:53.820]  I mean that means completely
[01:56:53.820 --> 01:56:54.820]  From the factory
[01:56:54.820 --> 01:56:55.820]  Everybody sold out
[01:56:55.820 --> 01:56:56.820]  So you better get your pro pure
[01:56:56.820 --> 01:56:58.820]  Fifteen percent off
[01:56:58.820 --> 01:56:59.820]  At infowarstore.com
[01:56:59.820 --> 01:57:01.820]  Okay enough from me
[01:57:01.820 --> 01:57:03.820]  Promo code water fifteen
[01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:04.820]  By the way to get that fifty percent off
[01:57:04.820 --> 01:57:06.820]  At infowarstore.com
[01:57:06.820 --> 01:57:08.820]  Let's go to Michael in Florida
[01:57:08.820 --> 01:57:09.820]  Thanks for holding
[01:57:09.820 --> 01:57:10.820]  You're on the air
[01:57:10.820 --> 01:57:12.820]  Hey Alex how you doing
[01:57:12.820 --> 01:57:13.820]  I'm actually pretty freaked out
[01:57:13.820 --> 01:57:15.820]  How fast stuff's moving
[01:57:15.820 --> 01:57:16.820]  When they're on television
[01:57:16.820 --> 01:57:18.820]  Admitting they're watching us
[01:57:18.820 --> 01:57:20.820]  Over our televisions and cell phones
[01:57:20.820 --> 01:57:21.820]  I mean again I knew that fifteen
[01:57:21.820 --> 01:57:22.820]  Sixteen years ago but now
[01:57:22.820 --> 01:57:23.820]  People are like big deal
[01:57:23.820 --> 01:57:24.820]  They're watching us
[01:57:24.820 --> 01:57:27.820]  I mean it's just over the top
[01:57:27.820 --> 01:57:29.820]  If they want us to give up ours
[01:57:29.820 --> 01:57:31.820]  But what I wanted to ask you about
[01:57:31.820 --> 01:57:33.820]  Is how come nobody voted
[01:57:33.820 --> 01:57:36.820]  Well boycotted the whole presidency
[01:57:36.820 --> 01:57:39.820]  It's like you get smallpox
[01:57:39.820 --> 01:57:41.820]  Or you get herpes
[01:57:41.820 --> 01:57:43.820]  You know they had bad choices
[01:57:43.820 --> 01:57:45.820]  Nobody hopped it out of that
[01:57:45.820 --> 01:57:47.820]  I think I'd probably actually want
[01:57:47.820 --> 01:57:49.820]  The herpes over the smallpox though
[01:57:49.820 --> 01:57:54.820]  I mean here's the problem
[01:57:54.820 --> 01:57:56.820]  Exactly what Cynthia McKinney said
[01:57:56.820 --> 01:57:59.820]  Obama is the more effective evil
[01:57:59.820 --> 01:58:01.820]  It's like the surgeon
[01:58:01.820 --> 01:58:02.820]  Neural orders chopping us up
[01:58:02.820 --> 01:58:03.820]  They're a torture expert
[01:58:03.820 --> 01:58:05.820]  And they go do I use these pliers
[01:58:05.820 --> 01:58:06.820]  Or this blow torch
[01:58:06.820 --> 01:58:08.820]  And they're like I think I'll use the blow torch
[01:58:08.820 --> 01:58:10.820]  The same guys got both guys
[01:58:10.820 --> 01:58:12.820]  Under his control
[01:58:12.820 --> 01:58:13.820]  Anyways I'm going to hold you over
[01:58:13.820 --> 01:58:14.820]  Keep going
[01:58:14.820 --> 01:58:17.820]  Okay but I mean just looking at what
[01:58:17.820 --> 01:58:19.820]  That everybody's eyes are becoming
[01:58:19.820 --> 01:58:20.820]  More open in this country
[01:58:20.820 --> 01:58:22.820]  And we had movements like
[01:58:22.820 --> 01:58:25.820]  Boycotting the Wall Street
[01:58:25.820 --> 01:58:26.820]  The Wall Street movement
[01:58:26.820 --> 01:58:28.820]  It's like why can't we do this
[01:58:28.820 --> 01:58:30.820]  To the presidential movement
[01:58:30.820 --> 01:58:32.820]  Because we've had 44 presidents
[01:58:32.820 --> 01:58:34.820]  None of them have fixed the problems
[01:58:34.820 --> 01:58:35.820]  Of this country
[01:58:35.820 --> 01:58:36.820]  Wow that's a great question
[01:58:36.820 --> 01:58:47.820]  Stay there I'll answer it
[01:59:06.820 --> 01:59:08.820]  Health is an area where we can all
[01:59:08.820 --> 01:59:09.820]  Take control of our lives
[01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:11.820]  And it all starts with that basic
[01:59:11.820 --> 01:59:13.820]  Building block of water
[01:59:13.820 --> 01:59:16.820]  It is time to purify our family's water
[01:59:16.820 --> 01:59:17.820]  The pro-pure filtration system
[01:59:17.820 --> 01:59:19.820]  With added fluoride filters
[01:59:19.820 --> 01:59:21.820]  Is the best system for my research
[01:59:21.820 --> 01:59:23.820]  To protect you and your family
[01:59:23.820 --> 01:59:26.820]  Infowarsstore.com already has the lowest prices
[01:59:26.820 --> 01:59:28.820]  On pro-pure water filtration

[01:59:32.820 --> 01:59:34.820]  The already lowest price

[01:59:36.820 --> 01:59:38.820]  Pro-pure go to infowarsstore.com
[01:59:38.820 --> 01:59:41.820]  And get 15% off the already lowest price
[01:59:41.820 --> 01:59:44.820]  Out there with the code water15

[01:59:46.820 --> 02:00:08.820]  At infowarsstore.com
[02:00:17.820 --> 02:00:20.820]  And now live from Austin, Texas
[02:00:20.820 --> 02:00:37.820]  Alex Jones
[02:00:37.820 --> 02:00:38.820]  Okay ladies and gentlemen
[02:00:38.820 --> 02:00:39.820]  We are back live
[02:00:39.820 --> 02:00:40.820]  We're talking to Michael and Florida
[02:00:40.820 --> 02:00:41.820]  We're going back to him in a moment
[02:00:41.820 --> 02:00:42.820]  He asked you know
[02:00:42.820 --> 02:00:44.820]  Why can't we get a good president
[02:00:44.820 --> 02:00:47.820]  Look Kennedy wasn't perfect
[02:00:47.820 --> 02:00:49.820]  But he really was trying
[02:00:49.820 --> 02:00:52.820]  To get a real civil rights movement going
[02:00:52.820 --> 02:00:55.820]  He was going to end the Vietnam War
[02:00:55.820 --> 02:00:57.820]  He stopped a nuclear war
[02:00:57.820 --> 02:00:59.820]  After the Cuban Missile Crisis
[02:00:59.820 --> 02:01:01.820]  He was going to abolish the Federal Reserve
[02:01:01.820 --> 02:01:05.820]  He signed the executive order to start that
[02:01:05.820 --> 02:01:08.820]  And it killed him
[02:01:08.820 --> 02:01:09.820]  And again he wasn't perfect
[02:01:09.820 --> 02:01:11.820]  I mean I actually studied him
[02:01:11.820 --> 02:01:13.820]  His brother Bobby Kennedy
[02:01:13.820 --> 02:01:15.820]  Was going to blow up the U.S. Embassy in Honduras
[02:01:15.820 --> 02:01:17.820]  To blame it on them to be able to invade
[02:01:17.820 --> 02:01:19.820]  And his brother overruled him
[02:01:19.820 --> 02:01:20.820]  But then Bobby kind of woke up later
[02:01:20.820 --> 02:01:21.820]  And was against stuff
[02:01:21.820 --> 02:01:26.820]  And they killed him too
[02:01:26.820 --> 02:01:28.820]  Reagan was the president for a little while
[02:01:28.820 --> 02:01:32.820]  Till he got shot
[02:01:32.820 --> 02:01:34.820]  And I know people that knew Reagan
[02:01:34.820 --> 02:01:36.820]  I mean he was actually anti-New World Order
[02:01:36.820 --> 02:01:38.820]  He was kind of a communist at first
[02:01:38.820 --> 02:01:39.820]  And that's on record
[02:01:39.820 --> 02:01:41.820]  And then he got into John Burke stuff
[02:01:41.820 --> 02:01:43.820]  And really wanted to be a president
[02:01:43.820 --> 02:01:44.820]  That's when he was governor
[02:01:44.820 --> 02:01:45.820]  He was Bohemian Grove
[02:01:45.820 --> 02:01:46.820]  You know the point is
[02:01:46.820 --> 02:01:49.820]  Not all these guys are evil
[02:01:49.820 --> 02:01:51.820]  But they get into the power structure
[02:01:51.820 --> 02:01:53.820]  And you get killed if you don't play ball
[02:01:53.820 --> 02:01:57.820]  But Clinton, Bush Sr, Bush Jr, Obama
[02:01:57.820 --> 02:02:00.820]  I mean these are bad people
[02:02:00.820 --> 02:02:02.820]  But with people like Bush Jr and Obama
[02:02:02.820 --> 02:02:04.820]  Man it's teleprompter city
[02:02:04.820 --> 02:02:07.820]  Obama's watching sports center playing basketball
[02:02:07.820 --> 02:02:09.820]  Taking naps, you know going to the theater
[02:02:09.820 --> 02:02:11.820]  He's having a good time
[02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:14.820]  I'm not saying he couldn't be president
[02:02:14.820 --> 02:02:15.820]  He's obviously a real smart guy
[02:02:15.820 --> 02:02:18.820]  But I mean I get hating Obama
[02:02:18.820 --> 02:02:19.820]  And I just hate Obama
[02:02:19.820 --> 02:02:20.820]  People like it on the radio
[02:02:20.820 --> 02:02:21.820]  And it's fun to hate somebody
[02:02:21.820 --> 02:02:23.820]  But it's kind of like I did in Bush's second term
[02:02:23.820 --> 02:02:25.820]  I'm like look he's a front man
[02:02:25.820 --> 02:02:28.820]  But you have to destroy the cult of Obama
[02:02:28.820 --> 02:02:30.820]  Or they're going to get their whole agenda through
[02:02:30.820 --> 02:02:32.820]  America's never been perfect
[02:02:32.820 --> 02:02:34.820]  But because it had some property rights
[02:02:34.820 --> 02:02:36.820]  It became the wealthiest country in the world
[02:02:36.820 --> 02:02:38.820]  But then when you become wealthy
[02:02:38.820 --> 02:02:39.820]  You become the new empire
[02:02:39.820 --> 02:02:41.820]  So then we've turned into that
[02:02:41.820 --> 02:02:45.820]  So we get 50, 60% depending on the four year cycle
[02:02:45.820 --> 02:02:46.820]  Turnouts for president
[02:02:46.820 --> 02:02:48.820]  We had low turnout this cycle
[02:02:48.820 --> 02:02:49.820]  For both parties
[02:02:49.820 --> 02:02:53.820]  We get 8.2, 8.4 locally is the national average
[02:02:53.820 --> 02:02:56.820]  Turnout, we need to get local turnouts up
[02:02:56.820 --> 02:02:58.820]  We need to expose the voting fraud
[02:02:58.820 --> 02:03:01.820]  You could have people run as new world order candidates
[02:03:01.820 --> 02:03:03.820]  And then double cross the globalist
[02:03:03.820 --> 02:03:05.820]  They do that and I'm not saying do that
[02:03:05.820 --> 02:03:06.820]  But this is a war
[02:03:06.820 --> 02:03:08.820]  And I've tried to have that debate with listeners
[02:03:08.820 --> 02:03:11.820]  Do we morally have businessmen and other people
[02:03:11.820 --> 02:03:13.820]  Act like their globalist
[02:03:13.820 --> 02:03:16.820]  To get into city council and to get into state houses
[02:03:16.820 --> 02:03:18.820]  To double cross the new world order
[02:03:18.820 --> 02:03:19.820]  You know that's what you do in war
[02:03:19.820 --> 02:03:21.820]  They've done that to us
[02:03:21.820 --> 02:03:23.820]  I think the frontal assault is the way to go
[02:03:23.820 --> 02:03:26.820]  Just discredit them, attack them, speak out against them
[02:03:26.820 --> 02:03:27.820]  And ask people that serve the system
[02:03:27.820 --> 02:03:29.820]  You really like where this is going
[02:03:29.820 --> 02:03:30.820]  Care about your kids
[02:03:30.820 --> 02:03:32.820]  Because even evil people deep down
[02:03:32.820 --> 02:03:35.820]  A lot of them don't care about their kids
[02:03:35.820 --> 02:03:38.820]  A lot of evil people were squashed when they were young
[02:03:38.820 --> 02:03:41.820]  And they have this feeling of innate human strength
[02:03:41.820 --> 02:03:44.820]  But they believe that if they cheat they'll get ahead
[02:03:44.820 --> 02:03:48.820]  But that never really gives value
[02:03:48.820 --> 02:03:52.820]  Real value is in doing things on the good path
[02:03:52.820 --> 02:03:53.820]  As best you can
[02:03:53.820 --> 02:03:55.820]  Doesn't mean you're not going to slip off the path
[02:03:55.820 --> 02:03:56.820]  Doesn't mean in a moment of competitiveness
[02:03:56.820 --> 02:03:58.820]  You're not going to do something bad
[02:03:58.820 --> 02:04:02.820]  But if you're not trying to govern yourself
[02:04:02.820 --> 02:04:04.820]  Well, you're going to slide right down into hell
[02:04:04.820 --> 02:04:07.820]  Does that answer your question, Michael?
[02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:08.820]  Kind of
[02:04:08.820 --> 02:04:09.820]  And I have one last question
[02:04:09.820 --> 02:04:12.820]  When they're trying to take our guns right now
[02:04:12.820 --> 02:04:15.820]  Like what phase of tyranny are we in right now?
[02:04:15.820 --> 02:04:16.820]  That's my last question
[02:04:16.820 --> 02:04:18.820]  Well, we're in a stalemate
[02:04:18.820 --> 02:04:20.820]  Man, these are great questions
[02:04:20.820 --> 02:04:22.820]  We're in a stalemate where the gun culture
[02:04:22.820 --> 02:04:25.820]  Like where's that Austin Chronicle thing with the lady hunting
[02:04:25.820 --> 02:04:27.820]  Is that out there now?
[02:04:27.820 --> 02:04:29.820]  I mean, all these women's magazines
[02:04:29.820 --> 02:04:31.820]  Whenever I'm at the store and women's magazines
[02:04:31.820 --> 02:04:32.820]  My wife takes
[02:04:32.820 --> 02:04:34.820]  It's like women shooting
[02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:35.820]  Women hunting
[02:04:35.820 --> 02:04:38.820]  Women boxing
[02:04:38.820 --> 02:04:42.820]  And what's happened is real feminine power
[02:04:42.820 --> 02:04:44.820]  Has overtaken the feminist movement
[02:04:44.820 --> 02:04:47.820]  And even liberal publications are capitulating to guns
[02:04:47.820 --> 02:04:50.820]  I'm going to come back
[02:04:50.820 --> 02:04:51.820]  Stay there still
[02:04:51.820 --> 02:04:52.820]  I want you to have a follow-up question
[02:04:52.820 --> 02:04:54.820]  I want to comment on where are we
[02:04:54.820 --> 02:04:56.820]  We're in a death battle
[02:04:56.820 --> 02:04:57.820]  Where we're at
[02:04:57.820 --> 02:04:59.820]  If you've ever wanted to be able to produce
[02:04:59.820 --> 02:05:01.820]  Boiling hot water anytime, anywhere
[02:05:01.820 --> 02:05:03.820]  With absolutely no power whatsoever
[02:05:03.820 --> 02:05:05.820]  Then this is going to be the most important message

[02:08:36.820 --> 02:08:41.820]  Media indulges in debunked hysteria while ignoring real crisis
[02:08:41.820 --> 02:08:43.820]  By Paul Watson and Alex Jones
[02:08:43.820 --> 02:08:47.820]  We've got one of our reports up at DrudgeReport.com today
[02:08:47.820 --> 02:08:51.820]  Spain threatens to deport filmmaker over anti-Islam film
[02:08:51.820 --> 02:08:57.820]  Video documentary questions whether Prophet Muhammad was child molester
[02:08:57.820 --> 02:09:00.820]  Folks, when the media gives one of these things attention
[02:09:00.820 --> 02:09:04.820]  And pre-hypes shit, they're about to use this as an excuse
[02:09:04.820 --> 02:09:07.820]  For Muslims having uprisings in Europe
[02:09:07.820 --> 02:09:10.820]  Europe is already having riots all over the place
[02:09:10.820 --> 02:09:13.820]  Because they're in a depression and they're going to just back drop it
[02:09:13.820 --> 02:09:16.820]  Like, oh, look, the Muslim threat, we've got to take your rights
[02:09:16.820 --> 02:09:18.820]  They're trying to stir them up
[02:09:18.820 --> 02:09:21.820]  So they can take your basic liberties
[02:09:21.820 --> 02:09:25.820]  And when the media builds up, oh, they're going to play the film Friday
[02:09:25.820 --> 02:09:28.820]  That's to alert all the Muslim groups to get upset
[02:09:28.820 --> 02:09:32.820]  So that they can keep their anti-Islam stuff going as a pretext
[02:09:32.820 --> 02:09:35.820]  To take over liberties in Europe and destroy free speech
[02:09:35.820 --> 02:09:38.820]  While bringing in record numbers of Muslims at the same time
[02:09:38.820 --> 02:09:43.820]  And ignore the fact that western governments, especially NATO
[02:09:43.820 --> 02:09:49.820]  That consortium of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization group is working with Al Qaeda
[02:09:49.820 --> 02:09:51.820]  And I can't believe the New York Times yesterday came out
[02:09:51.820 --> 02:09:53.820]  Admitted the west is arming Al Qaeda
[02:09:53.820 --> 02:09:56.820]  And basically said the CFR line that, well, we need them
[02:09:56.820 --> 02:09:58.820]  And you know, they're not that bad
[02:09:58.820 --> 02:10:00.820]  Actually, we're going to be friends with Al Qaeda now
[02:10:00.820 --> 02:10:02.820]  Until they blow up airliners in the west
[02:10:02.820 --> 02:10:05.820]  Which I am predicting will happen in the next two years
[02:10:05.820 --> 02:10:07.820]  If this continues
[02:10:07.820 --> 02:10:09.820]  We could stop it by exposing it
[02:10:09.820 --> 02:10:13.820]  Remember that when they start shooting down airlines
[02:10:13.820 --> 02:10:16.820]  And that we've got to set up checkpoints now within five miles of the airport
[02:10:16.820 --> 02:10:19.820]  Because these missiles fire to 5,000 feet
[02:10:19.820 --> 02:10:22.820]  And they're shooting aircraft that are coming in for landings and taking off
[02:10:22.820 --> 02:10:23.820]  I can see the whole thing
[02:10:23.820 --> 02:10:26.820]  We've got to have checkpoints, we've got to search vehicles on the highways
[02:10:26.820 --> 02:10:28.820]  Because of the missiles, the missiles, the missiles
[02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:30.820]  And I'll be like, oh, the government gave it to them
[02:10:30.820 --> 02:10:32.820]  Shut up, you traitor, you filth
[02:10:32.820 --> 02:10:35.820]  You're an American piece of garbage
[02:10:35.820 --> 02:10:37.820]  I mean, you know, that's how they operate
[02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:39.820]  Actually, the foreign banks run Al Qaeda
[02:10:39.820 --> 02:10:41.820]  Shut up, you anti-American traitor
[02:10:41.820 --> 02:10:44.820]  Arrest him, shut him off the radio
[02:10:44.820 --> 02:10:48.820]  You know, a major city just got hit by Al Qaeda with a suitcase nuke
[02:10:48.820 --> 02:10:49.820]  They're now hyping that
[02:10:49.820 --> 02:10:52.820]  The globalists are setting up for a total takeover
[02:10:52.820 --> 02:10:53.820]  What will trigger it?
[02:10:53.820 --> 02:10:55.820]  Something like a bio weapon release or a suitcase nuke
[02:10:55.820 --> 02:10:59.820]  I don't know which one, but the elites are all moving to offshore islands and things
[02:10:59.820 --> 02:11:01.820]  And I've talked to some of them off record
[02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:04.820]  And they just go, oh my gosh, World War III
[02:11:04.820 --> 02:11:06.820]  And I've been telling you this for years
[02:11:06.820 --> 02:11:07.820]  It's not the news that's happening
[02:11:07.820 --> 02:11:09.820]  So we're going to get into all that
[02:11:09.820 --> 02:11:12.820]  Now, if I can have a document cam on this for PresidentPlanet.tv viewers
[02:11:12.820 --> 02:11:14.820]  Just wherever you're aiming it, I'll put it
[02:11:14.820 --> 02:11:16.820]  And wherever you want, there you go
[02:11:16.820 --> 02:11:18.820]  Some of my doodling there
[02:11:18.820 --> 02:11:21.820]  And you can see this article out of the Chronicle
[02:11:21.820 --> 02:11:23.820]  Now, I meant to bring these magazines this morning
[02:11:23.820 --> 02:11:25.820]  But I got busy building Legos with my children
[02:11:25.820 --> 02:11:26.820]  And forgot to do it
[02:11:26.820 --> 02:11:29.820]  This is the Austin Chronicle last week
[02:11:29.820 --> 02:11:33.820]  I didn't properly get to this
[02:11:33.820 --> 02:11:38.820]  And in my house, there's these women's magazines just festooning the entire house
[02:11:38.820 --> 02:11:43.820]  I don't think my wife even subscribes to these
[02:11:43.820 --> 02:11:45.820]  We just got on some lists
[02:11:45.820 --> 02:11:46.820]  We get all these women's magazines
[02:11:46.820 --> 02:11:48.820]  And so I'm flipping through them, and I see them laying around
[02:11:48.820 --> 02:11:50.820]  And it's women with guns, women hunting
[02:11:50.820 --> 02:11:51.820]  I mean, just everywhere
[02:11:51.820 --> 02:11:53.820]  This is the hottest thing
[02:11:53.820 --> 02:11:58.820]  And I was watching, I think it's Discovery Channel
[02:11:58.820 --> 02:12:01.820]  And it got these shows with people in Alaska
[02:12:01.820 --> 02:12:04.820]  And these women hunting and living on the land with their husbands
[02:12:04.820 --> 02:12:05.820]  And how much they love it
[02:12:05.820 --> 02:12:09.820]  And then I know, because I see all the former yuppies
[02:12:09.820 --> 02:12:11.820]  Because I've got small children
[02:12:11.820 --> 02:12:13.820]  I go to these homeschool groups
[02:12:13.820 --> 02:12:16.820]  And it's usually doctors, lawyers, scientists
[02:12:16.820 --> 02:12:19.820]  And sometimes they don't even know who I am
[02:12:19.820 --> 02:12:23.820]  And they're going, yes, we're here
[02:12:23.820 --> 02:12:25.820]  Preparing for the engineered collapse
[02:12:25.820 --> 02:12:30.820]  Yes, I work in bio
[02:12:30.820 --> 02:12:35.820]  You know, serum developments in microbiology
[02:12:35.820 --> 02:12:38.820]  And, you know, there'll be a doctor there at the little party
[02:12:38.820 --> 02:12:39.820]  This has happened like every time
[02:12:39.820 --> 02:12:41.820]  It's like, you don't know who Mr. Jones is?
[02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:42.820]  Yes, he's aware of the
[02:12:42.820 --> 02:12:44.820]  I've been aware for 20 years of their program
[02:12:44.820 --> 02:12:46.820]  They tried to invite me into it
[02:12:46.820 --> 02:12:48.820]  And there's all these
[02:12:48.820 --> 02:12:50.820]  But the point is these women are all hunting
[02:12:50.820 --> 02:12:51.820]  And butchering their own food
[02:12:51.820 --> 02:12:54.820]  And going to these co-ops and milking their own cows
[02:12:54.820 --> 02:12:57.820]  And then the husbands go in and like are doctors and scientists
[02:12:57.820 --> 02:13:01.820]  And I've been to event after event after event
[02:13:01.820 --> 02:13:03.820]  Where these homeschoolers
[02:13:03.820 --> 02:13:05.820]  Their middle class are wealthy homeschoolers
[02:13:05.820 --> 02:13:07.820]  And they all know about the New World Order
[02:13:07.820 --> 02:13:10.820]  And then I turn on TV and this is the new thing
[02:13:10.820 --> 02:13:13.820]  So let me announce to you what this means
[02:13:13.820 --> 02:13:15.820]  The globalists don't fully control the media
[02:13:15.820 --> 02:13:17.820]  They're able to steer it with government money
[02:13:17.820 --> 02:13:19.820]  With propaganda placement, you know, 10 million a year
[02:13:19.820 --> 02:13:22.820]  For pro-Obamacare messages in TV and movies
[02:13:22.820 --> 02:13:24.820]  In fact, guys, type that in
[02:13:24.820 --> 02:13:25.820]  People won't believe it
[02:13:25.820 --> 02:13:27.820]  Just type in
[02:13:27.820 --> 02:13:29.820]  I have a brainstorm here on this
[02:13:29.820 --> 02:13:31.820]  Happens all the time, then I start going 100 directions
[02:13:31.820 --> 02:13:33.820]  Type in, let me give you the exact headline
[02:13:33.820 --> 02:13:37.820]  Pro-Obamacare messages to be in movies and TV
[02:13:37.820 --> 02:13:39.820]  And then it's a footnote, by the way
[02:13:39.820 --> 02:13:41.820]  They're paying millions every few months for this
[02:13:41.820 --> 02:13:45.820]  But they don't control every newspaper, every writer, every magazine
[02:13:45.820 --> 02:13:47.820]  There's a lot of oversight
[02:13:47.820 --> 02:13:50.820]  They just say, no protesting, in-ground zero
[02:13:50.820 --> 02:13:52.820]  No police allowed, because so many cops
[02:13:52.820 --> 02:13:54.820]  Get in Giuliani's face about the bombs
[02:13:54.820 --> 02:13:56.820]  You know, they say, no one allowed
[02:13:56.820 --> 02:13:58.820]  Unless you agree with the official story
[02:13:58.820 --> 02:14:00.820]  At the JFK Memorial now
[02:14:00.820 --> 02:14:03.820]  And now cops are showing up arresting people at the park
[02:14:03.820 --> 02:14:06.820]  Who talk to others, the famous researchers
[02:14:06.820 --> 02:14:08.820]  You go talk to people there that are asking you questions
[02:14:08.820 --> 02:14:10.820]  The tourists, they arrest you now
[02:14:10.820 --> 02:14:12.820]  I mean, it's North Korea up in Dallas
[02:14:12.820 --> 02:14:13.820]  We're on the radio up in Dallas
[02:14:13.820 --> 02:14:15.820]  Very, very scary, it's been newspaper articles
[02:14:15.820 --> 02:14:17.820]  They're like, well, maybe you should, you know, there it is
[02:14:17.820 --> 02:14:19.820]  Modern family, Grey's Anatomy to feature
[02:14:19.820 --> 02:14:21.820]  Obamacare propaganda
[02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:23.820]  Yeah, that's a...
[02:14:23.820 --> 02:14:25.820]  What is that, Daily Caller?
[02:14:25.820 --> 02:14:27.820]  No, that's the inquisitor, no, no, no
[02:14:27.820 --> 02:14:31.820]  Not feature the propaganda, they're paying for it
[02:14:31.820 --> 02:14:35.820]  Anyway, side issue, their name for it is
[02:14:35.820 --> 02:14:37.820]  Behavior Placement
[02:14:37.820 --> 02:14:41.820]  Because it's not product placement
[02:14:41.820 --> 02:14:44.820]  It's behavior placement, my term, 15 years old
[02:14:44.820 --> 02:14:47.820]  Is propaganda placement, but that's a side issue
[02:14:47.820 --> 02:14:50.820]  I had a caller about to go back to Michael
[02:14:50.820 --> 02:14:52.820]  And we'll go to others
[02:14:52.820 --> 02:14:55.820]  He was asking, you know, where are we on the scale of this fight
[02:14:55.820 --> 02:14:57.820]  Yeah, there's no American magazine
[02:14:57.820 --> 02:14:59.820]  Taxpayers defund Hollywood Obamacare propaganda
[02:14:59.820 --> 02:15:02.820]  There you go, and then they've got links to the mainstream news
[02:15:02.820 --> 02:15:07.820]  That California officials are overseeing the federal money
[02:15:07.820 --> 02:15:10.820]  In Hollywood for the messages
[02:15:10.820 --> 02:15:12.820]  Okay, there you go, it's got links to it right there
[02:15:12.820 --> 02:15:15.820]  Now, the point is, see, that's a mark of North Korea
[02:15:15.820 --> 02:15:17.820]  Or Soviet Russia or Nazi Germany
[02:15:17.820 --> 02:15:19.820]  When the government's involved in things
[02:15:19.820 --> 02:15:21.820]  But they don't run at all, that's why they want fairness doctrine
[02:15:21.820 --> 02:15:24.820]  Internet taxes that can be selectively enforced
[02:15:24.820 --> 02:15:27.820]  That's because they need to prop up the state-run media
[02:15:27.820 --> 02:15:31.820]  I mean, look, this has been going on for 50 years or more
[02:15:31.820 --> 02:15:34.820]  But now it's gotten really bad, but most of these big empires of media
[02:15:34.820 --> 02:15:38.820]  They didn't build those empires, government tax money
[02:15:38.820 --> 02:15:43.820]  Built CBS, built NBC, built Fox, built CNN
[02:15:43.820 --> 02:15:46.820]  CNN, until a few years ago, now they're cheaper
[02:15:46.820 --> 02:15:50.820]  This is enough to do it, they were on military pentagon satellites
[02:15:50.820 --> 02:15:53.820]  That's why it came out in the Washington Post in 2000
[02:15:53.820 --> 02:15:55.820]  But they reported it like it was no big deal
[02:15:55.820 --> 02:15:57.820]  People say, well, I thought the mainstream media lies
[02:15:57.820 --> 02:15:59.820]  No, the audience was like, oh, there's the reason
[02:15:59.820 --> 02:16:01.820]  CIA and pentagon psychological warfare
[02:16:01.820 --> 02:16:04.820]  Is it CNN, you know, approving all the stories is
[02:16:04.820 --> 02:16:10.820]  Well, you know, CNN uses department of defense satellites worldwide
[02:16:10.820 --> 02:16:13.820]  See how that works, it is department of defense
[02:16:13.820 --> 02:16:15.820]  Google is department of defense
[02:16:15.820 --> 02:16:17.820]  And people are like, well, at least it's American
[02:16:17.820 --> 02:16:20.820]  The department of defense since 1947
[02:16:20.820 --> 02:16:22.820]  When it became the department of defense
[02:16:22.820 --> 02:16:26.820]  Is run by the Rothschilds
[02:16:26.820 --> 02:16:29.820]  They own the Federal Reserve, they own the Rockefellers
[02:16:29.820 --> 02:16:32.820]  I told you this decades ago from top researchers
[02:16:32.820 --> 02:16:35.820]  In Congress, from the congressional research
[02:16:35.820 --> 02:16:38.820]  Like Anthony Sutton, it's on record
[02:16:38.820 --> 02:16:39.820]  And what did they do this year?
[02:16:39.820 --> 02:16:42.820]  They merged the Rothschild Rockefeller private wealth
[02:16:42.820 --> 02:16:45.820]  They've not just merged their banks like 2000 publicly
[02:16:45.820 --> 02:16:47.820]  They merged their wealth
[02:16:47.820 --> 02:16:50.820]  Every time they arrest a Russian oligarch, Putin does
[02:16:50.820 --> 02:16:52.820]  The money's gone because there were a Rothschild front
[02:16:52.820 --> 02:16:54.820]  The Rothschild sued over those claims
[02:16:54.820 --> 02:16:56.820]  Major newspapers lost the suit
[02:16:56.820 --> 02:17:01.820]  The judge said, basically this suit proved those that you sued
[02:17:01.820 --> 02:17:04.820]  Again, showing they're not all powerful
[02:17:04.820 --> 02:17:06.820]  But look at this right here
[02:17:06.820 --> 02:17:08.820]  If you look at the cover of the Chronicle
[02:17:08.820 --> 02:17:10.820]  They're November 30th issue
[02:17:10.820 --> 02:17:12.820]  Going out for dinner
[02:17:12.820 --> 02:17:15.820]  Women's hunting and butchering camp
[02:17:15.820 --> 02:17:17.820]  Listen, when you butcher an animal
[02:17:17.820 --> 02:17:19.820]  It's not fun to chop them up like you're some psycho
[02:17:19.820 --> 02:17:21.820]  And it's a power trip
[02:17:21.820 --> 02:17:23.820]  You just go into a mode
[02:17:23.820 --> 02:17:24.820]  Even if you weren't trained in it
[02:17:24.820 --> 02:17:25.820]  You automatically know how to do it
[02:17:25.820 --> 02:17:27.820]  Because your ancestors did it over and over again
[02:17:27.820 --> 02:17:29.820]  You're hardwired
[02:17:29.820 --> 02:17:31.820]  Just like you smell a woman
[02:17:31.820 --> 02:17:32.820]  And you like how she looks
[02:17:32.820 --> 02:17:34.820]  And you know what to do
[02:17:34.820 --> 02:17:38.820]  It's all ingrained, ladies and gentlemen
[02:17:38.820 --> 02:17:40.820]  And they've got an article in here
[02:17:40.820 --> 02:17:42.820]  Showing women hunting
[02:17:42.820 --> 02:17:47.820]  This is the most liberal publication in the known galaxy
[02:17:47.820 --> 02:17:50.820]  The owner of this hates me with a passion
[02:17:50.820 --> 02:17:53.820]  Physically runs out of a building if I enter it
[02:17:53.820 --> 02:17:56.820]  It's some of the film events I've been in
[02:17:56.820 --> 02:18:00.820]  And it shows whole baby furlough grilled with herbs
[02:18:00.820 --> 02:18:03.820]  White-tailed deer, the women learning how to hunt
[02:18:03.820 --> 02:18:07.820]  Learning how to butcher the deer
[02:18:07.820 --> 02:18:10.820]  Now, folks, this is in almost all the women's magazines
[02:18:10.820 --> 02:18:12.820]  I run across now
[02:18:12.820 --> 02:18:14.820]  That's winning
[02:18:14.820 --> 02:18:18.820]  We're now winning
[02:18:18.820 --> 02:18:22.820]  So you ask, where are we right now?
[02:18:22.820 --> 02:18:25.820]  There's basic hard-wiring human coding
[02:18:25.820 --> 02:18:27.820]  To want to have the male and female roles
[02:18:27.820 --> 02:18:29.820]  To want to protect your local tribe
[02:18:29.820 --> 02:18:31.820]  To want to be strong, to want to thrive
[02:18:31.820 --> 02:18:33.820]  Then there's globalist scientific dictatorship
[02:18:33.820 --> 02:18:35.820]  Developed by Inbred, British Royals and others
[02:18:35.820 --> 02:18:38.820]  Who wanted to find why they were Inbred
[02:18:38.820 --> 02:18:41.820]  And why their kids were born to be formed or stillborn
[02:18:41.820 --> 02:18:43.820]  They funded Eugenics
[02:18:43.820 --> 02:18:45.820]  Eugenics told them they were the elite
[02:18:45.820 --> 02:18:49.820]  The whole world is set up and following a pre-positioned program
[02:18:49.820 --> 02:18:53.820]  That invented computers, everything out of Eugenics
[02:18:53.820 --> 02:18:55.820]  Biometrics, all of it
[02:18:55.820 --> 02:18:57.820]  All the new sciences come out of this
[02:18:57.820 --> 02:18:59.820]  You have the snake oil cells when a big pharma
[02:18:59.820 --> 02:19:03.820]  Who were literally selling stuff out of the back of a horse-drawn carriage
[02:19:03.820 --> 02:19:05.820]  Sandal curing your eels
[02:19:05.820 --> 02:19:07.820]  Make you grow hair on your head
[02:19:07.820 --> 02:19:09.820]  Illia of your rheumatoid arthritis
[02:19:09.820 --> 02:19:11.820]  Whatever it is, if you drink this laudanum
[02:19:11.820 --> 02:19:13.820]  That was really opium
[02:19:13.820 --> 02:19:15.820]  Those companies became ultra-rich
[02:19:15.820 --> 02:19:17.820]  They promised the elites unlimited power
[02:19:17.820 --> 02:19:19.820]  If they'd give them funding
[02:19:19.820 --> 02:19:21.820]  They created modern medicine that we're now under
[02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:23.820]  And it's a giant extermination operation
[02:19:23.820 --> 02:19:25.820]  So to answer the question of the caller
[02:19:25.820 --> 02:19:27.820]  Where are we in the scale of tyranny
[02:19:27.820 --> 02:19:29.820]  We're in a death battle
[02:19:29.820 --> 02:19:31.820]  With our food and water being poisoned
[02:19:31.820 --> 02:19:33.820]  Being brainwashed, being propagandized
[02:19:33.820 --> 02:19:37.820]  5,000 levels of safe fluoride in the toothpaste
[02:19:37.820 --> 02:19:39.820]  Covered that first hour
[02:19:39.820 --> 02:19:41.820]  All of this, while they're going after our guns
[02:19:41.820 --> 02:19:43.820]  And announcing we'll just take your guns
[02:19:43.820 --> 02:19:45.820]  Without a law
[02:19:45.820 --> 02:19:47.820]  You have your second amendment, but still we can take them from you
[02:19:47.820 --> 02:19:49.820]  You have a right to have a pop gun on the blue moon
[02:19:49.820 --> 02:19:53.820]  Doesn't matter, suddenly the liberals are all going out and buying
[02:19:53.820 --> 02:19:55.820]  As many guns as they can
[02:19:55.820 --> 02:19:57.820]  And deprogramming going
[02:19:57.820 --> 02:19:59.820]  So they lie and come out and say that Obama
[02:19:59.820 --> 02:20:01.820]  Is a mandate
[02:20:01.820 --> 02:20:03.820]  This man wants your guns
[02:20:03.820 --> 02:20:05.820]  That is the cover of the 60 page glossy magazine
[02:20:05.820 --> 02:20:07.820]  Jam packed with information
[02:20:07.820 --> 02:20:09.820]  The December issue
[02:20:09.820 --> 02:20:11.820]  Of Info Wars Magazine
[02:20:11.820 --> 02:20:13.820]  Info Wars Magazine gives you a powerful tool

[02:21:01.820 --> 02:21:03.820]  My name is Frank Bates
[02:21:03.820 --> 02:21:05.820]  What I'm about to tell you in the next 60 seconds
[02:21:05.820 --> 02:21:07.820]  Could get me in a lot of trouble
[02:21:07.820 --> 02:21:09.820]  I just created a free video presentation
[02:21:09.820 --> 02:21:11.820]  At 123coverup.com
[02:21:11.820 --> 02:21:13.820]  That exposes the electricity monopolies
[02:21:13.820 --> 02:21:15.820]  And government agencies for what they really are
[02:21:15.820 --> 02:21:17.820]  Incompetent line crooks
[02:21:17.820 --> 02:21:19.820]  That are counting on your ignorance and fear
[02:21:19.820 --> 02:21:21.820]  To keep your power bills criminally high
[02:21:21.820 --> 02:21:23.820]  Some have called this a conspiracy
[02:21:23.820 --> 02:21:25.820]  Others have called it a cover-up
[02:21:25.820 --> 02:21:27.820]  And you will be shocked
[02:21:27.820 --> 02:21:29.820]  To find out how deep the conspiracy goes

[02:22:21.820 --> 02:22:23.820]  But it's not Africa, it's Argentina
[02:22:23.820 --> 02:22:25.820]  One-on-one guided hunts for water buffalo
[02:22:25.820 --> 02:22:27.820]  Hooger, big horn rams
[02:22:27.820 --> 02:22:29.820]  Wild boar, and the biggest

[02:22:31.820 --> 02:22:33.820]  All gold metal quality
[02:22:33.820 --> 02:22:35.820]  All the action you can handle
[02:22:35.820 --> 02:22:37.820]  Land rovers
[02:22:37.820 --> 02:22:39.820]  Top rental guns with scopes
[02:22:39.820 --> 02:22:41.820]  All food, beverages, hunting guides
[02:22:41.820 --> 02:22:43.820]  Ground transportation included

[02:22:45.820 --> 02:22:47.820]  Than you can imagine
[02:22:47.820 --> 02:22:49.820]  The adventure of a lifetime
[02:22:49.820 --> 02:22:53.820]  Starts at GoldenStagsSafaris.com
[02:22:53.820 --> 02:22:55.820]  The big game hunting ranch
[02:22:55.820 --> 02:22:57.820]  GoldenStagsSafaris.com
[02:23:03.820 --> 02:23:05.820]  In the US, one in every 50 homes
[02:23:05.820 --> 02:23:07.820]  Will have a break in this year
[02:23:07.820 --> 02:23:09.820]  Burglars call it smash and grab
[02:23:09.820 --> 02:23:11.820]  Police call it robbery
[02:23:11.820 --> 02:23:13.820]  We call it avoidable
[02:23:13.820 --> 02:23:15.820]  We are fake TV
[02:23:15.820 --> 02:23:17.820]  A simple electronic device
[02:23:17.820 --> 02:23:19.820]  That can fool even professional burglars
[02:23:19.820 --> 02:23:21.820]  Fake TV easily plugs in
[02:23:21.820 --> 02:23:23.820]  To any outlet and simulates
[02:23:23.820 --> 02:23:25.820]  The changing colors of a television
[02:23:25.820 --> 02:23:27.820]  To a burglar, it looks like
[02:23:27.820 --> 02:23:29.820]  Someone must be home watching TV
[02:23:29.820 --> 02:23:31.820]  So they'll likely move on to an easier target
[02:23:31.820 --> 02:23:33.820]  At only $34.95
[02:23:33.820 --> 02:23:35.820]  Fake TV costs less than
[02:23:35.820 --> 02:23:37.820]  A month of most alarm monitoring plans
[02:23:37.820 --> 02:23:39.820]  And makes a great Christmas gift
[02:23:39.820 --> 02:23:41.820]  Or it's perfect if you're traveling
[02:23:41.820 --> 02:23:43.820]  Over the holidays
[02:23:43.820 --> 02:23:45.820]  Order your fake TV by calling
[02:23:45.820 --> 02:23:47.820]  5-FAKE-TV
[02:23:47.820 --> 02:23:49.820]  Or go to faketv.com
[02:23:49.820 --> 02:23:53.820]  That's 877-532-5388
[02:23:53.820 --> 02:23:55.820]  Or faketv.com
[02:23:55.820 --> 02:23:57.820]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent
[02:24:05.820 --> 02:24:09.820]  What I'm trying to get out here is this
[02:24:09.820 --> 02:24:11.820]  Then I'll go to your calls
[02:24:11.820 --> 02:24:13.820]  They have to sell the public
[02:24:13.820 --> 02:24:15.820]  Like it's a fad or the Christmas toy
[02:24:15.820 --> 02:24:17.820]  Everybody's got to get that
[02:24:17.820 --> 02:24:19.820]  Ooh Obama won
[02:24:19.820 --> 02:24:21.820]  It's a mandate for
[02:24:21.820 --> 02:24:23.820]  Taking your guns and opening the borders
[02:24:23.820 --> 02:24:25.820]  And massive tax increases
[02:24:25.820 --> 02:24:27.820]  And then lots of pundits
[02:24:27.820 --> 02:24:29.820]  Going ah-ha white raises you lost
[02:24:29.820 --> 02:24:31.820]  Even though record numbers of
[02:24:31.820 --> 02:24:33.820]  Quote whites who are conservative
[02:24:33.820 --> 02:24:35.820]  You can look it up, didn't vote
[02:24:35.820 --> 02:24:37.820]  They're like this whole thing staged
[02:24:37.820 --> 02:24:39.820]  They're not voting racially
[02:24:39.820 --> 02:24:41.820]  They'd vote for a black
[02:24:41.820 --> 02:24:43.820]  Patriot in about one and a half seconds
[02:24:43.820 --> 02:24:45.820]  After they stumbled over each other
[02:24:45.820 --> 02:24:47.820]  To get to the voting levers
[02:24:47.820 --> 02:24:49.820]  But they just sell that
[02:24:49.820 --> 02:24:51.820]  And so all these people that are fad driven
[02:24:51.820 --> 02:24:53.820]  That go out and do whatever the media
[02:24:53.820 --> 02:24:55.820]  Ooh Obama, he's got a mandate
[02:24:55.820 --> 02:24:57.820]  Ooh, he can do whatever he wants
[02:24:57.820 --> 02:24:59.820]  And the Republican leadership comes out and goes
[02:24:59.820 --> 02:25:01.820]  I guess you've got your mandate
[02:25:01.820 --> 02:25:03.820]  Alright, we'll give you two big attacks increases
[02:25:03.820 --> 02:25:05.820]  And Obama says I'll take full takeover
[02:25:05.820 --> 02:25:07.820]  I want even more
[02:25:07.820 --> 02:25:09.820]  I want the power of the purse
[02:25:09.820 --> 02:25:11.820]  Hold on, we won't give you that, okay, maybe
[02:25:11.820 --> 02:25:13.820]  And I got control of the internet too
[02:25:13.820 --> 02:25:15.820]  Alright, I guess you beat us
[02:25:15.820 --> 02:25:17.820]  They're all paid for by the same globalist
[02:25:17.820 --> 02:25:19.820]  When you get to that committee chairman level
[02:25:19.820 --> 02:25:21.820]  That's why Boehner and Obama
[02:25:21.820 --> 02:25:23.820]  Are always playing golf and smoking cigarettes
[02:25:23.820 --> 02:25:25.820]  And they've been caught sneaking around
[02:25:25.820 --> 02:25:27.820]  Drinking beer together
[02:25:27.820 --> 02:25:29.820]  It's all a big joke
[02:25:29.820 --> 02:25:31.820]  Those guys are ah-ha-ha-ha
[02:25:31.820 --> 02:25:33.820]  Let's go drink it ah-ha-ha
[02:25:33.820 --> 02:25:35.820]  I mean that's why they're propping him up
[02:25:35.820 --> 02:25:37.820]  Newt Gennrich was the same deal
[02:25:37.820 --> 02:25:39.820]  Are there some good Republicans in there?
[02:25:39.820 --> 02:25:41.820]  Yeah, there have been some good Democrats
[02:25:41.820 --> 02:25:43.820]  But we're in a lot of trouble here
[02:25:43.820 --> 02:25:45.820]  And so it's this idea
[02:25:45.820 --> 02:25:47.820]  Oh, there's a president
[02:25:47.820 --> 02:25:49.820]  Obama can do whatever he wants
[02:25:49.820 --> 02:25:51.820]  Well he won, that means give him the power of the purse
[02:25:51.820 --> 02:25:53.820]  Oh yeah, let's not have any separation of powers
[02:25:53.820 --> 02:25:55.820]  Any checks and balances
[02:25:55.820 --> 02:25:57.820]  The truth is
[02:25:57.820 --> 02:25:59.820]  They can't sell any of the tickets
[02:25:59.820 --> 02:26:01.820]  That's in the Washington Post
[02:26:01.820 --> 02:26:03.820]  It's record low that they've ever recorded
[02:26:03.820 --> 02:26:05.820]  Tickets, hotels, no one's booking
[02:26:05.820 --> 02:26:07.820]  To go to the inauguration
[02:26:07.820 --> 02:26:09.820]  It was the biggest inauguration ever
[02:26:09.820 --> 02:26:11.820]  Four years ago
[02:26:11.820 --> 02:26:13.820]  On record
[02:26:13.820 --> 02:26:15.820]  How many did they say? Like five million or something?
[02:26:15.820 --> 02:26:17.820]  I mean it was ridiculous
[02:26:17.820 --> 02:26:19.820]  The truth is Obama is completely unpopular
[02:26:19.820 --> 02:26:21.820]  But they've got to act like
[02:26:21.820 --> 02:26:23.820]  Hey everybody likes him
[02:26:23.820 --> 02:26:25.820]  Just like Bev Harris has said
[02:26:25.820 --> 02:26:27.820]  She doesn't think we're going to ever have any real elections
[02:26:27.820 --> 02:26:29.820]  Again until this turns around
[02:26:29.820 --> 02:26:31.820]  So this was the most fraudulent she's ever seen
[02:26:31.820 --> 02:26:33.820]  In partisan
[02:26:33.820 --> 02:26:35.820]  I mean they just announced
[02:26:35.820 --> 02:26:37.820]  States before any votes were counted to the day
[02:26:37.820 --> 02:26:39.820]  They announced prop 37
[02:26:39.820 --> 02:26:41.820]  Do you really believe
[02:26:41.820 --> 02:26:43.820]  That Californians didn't want stuff labeled
[02:26:43.820 --> 02:26:45.820]  When polls showed two to one they wanted it labeled
[02:26:45.820 --> 02:26:47.820]  But magically, come on folks
[02:26:47.820 --> 02:26:49.820]  Come on folks
[02:26:49.820 --> 02:26:51.820]  The fix is in
[02:26:51.820 --> 02:26:53.820]  If the government, let me ask this question
[02:26:53.820 --> 02:26:55.820]  I said this in the first hour, I'll say it again
[02:26:55.820 --> 02:26:57.820]  If the government on record did tens
[02:26:57.820 --> 02:26:59.820]  Of thousands of experiments
[02:26:59.820 --> 02:27:01.820]  Each experiment involved thousands
[02:27:01.820 --> 02:27:03.820]  Our government
[02:27:03.820 --> 02:27:05.820]  The Department of Energy paid Israel
[02:27:05.820 --> 02:27:07.820]  The equivalent of
[02:27:07.820 --> 02:27:09.820]  It was like seven, eight, nine billion dollars
[02:27:09.820 --> 02:27:11.820]  That's in my film in game
[02:27:11.820 --> 02:27:13.820]  Off Israeli TV, this is declassified
[02:27:13.820 --> 02:27:15.820]  To take poor Jewish children
[02:27:15.820 --> 02:27:17.820]  Who were dark-skinned
[02:27:17.820 --> 02:27:19.820]  The Sephardic Jews
[02:27:19.820 --> 02:27:21.820]  Who have more original
[02:27:21.820 --> 02:27:23.820]  Jewish genetics than anybody
[02:27:23.820 --> 02:27:25.820]  Middle Eastern Jews, North African Jews
[02:27:25.820 --> 02:27:27.820]  Our government paid Israel
[02:27:27.820 --> 02:27:29.820]  110,000 of them from 1959
[02:27:29.820 --> 02:27:31.820]  To 1969
[02:27:31.820 --> 02:27:33.820]  The Ringworm children say
[02:27:33.820 --> 02:27:35.820]  We're going to take you in to check you for fungus
[02:27:35.820 --> 02:27:37.820]  Some of them they hit with so much radiation
[02:27:37.820 --> 02:27:39.820]  They died within days, others are still alive
[02:27:39.820 --> 02:27:41.820]  With all their hair falling out and stuff
[02:27:41.820 --> 02:27:43.820]  And mentally retarded
[02:27:43.820 --> 02:27:45.820]  Now ladies and gentlemen
[02:27:45.820 --> 02:27:47.820]  They had Department of Energy studies
[02:27:47.820 --> 02:27:49.820]  Look them up where over 4,000 U.S. foster kids were killed
[02:27:49.820 --> 02:27:51.820]  In some cases
[02:27:51.820 --> 02:27:53.820]  They would burn the kid
[02:27:53.820 --> 02:27:55.820]  Because they were doing different tests
[02:27:55.820 --> 02:27:57.820]  They would be burned to the metal
[02:27:57.820 --> 02:27:59.820]  Doctors that went public about it
[02:27:59.820 --> 02:28:01.820]  And said that they would have to unstick them
[02:28:01.820 --> 02:28:03.820]  Like an egg
[02:28:03.820 --> 02:28:05.820]  Now if the people running things
[02:28:05.820 --> 02:28:07.820]  Will burn a kid for no reason
[02:28:07.820 --> 02:28:09.820]  Because it wasn't about testing radiation
[02:28:09.820 --> 02:28:11.820]  It was about testing government scientists to see what they do
[02:28:11.820 --> 02:28:13.820]  They get big groups of them in there
[02:28:13.820 --> 02:28:15.820]  In white lab coats and say watch this
[02:28:15.820 --> 02:28:17.820]  To see and mark down
[02:28:17.820 --> 02:28:19.820]  Just like when FEMA comes to the police departments and says
[02:28:19.820 --> 02:28:21.820]  George Washington was a bad person
[02:28:21.820 --> 02:28:23.820]  They got guys sitting there with notes watching everybody
[02:28:23.820 --> 02:28:25.820]  Yeah and freedom is bad
[02:28:25.820 --> 02:28:27.820]  And they're watching the cops and cops would agree
[02:28:27.820 --> 02:28:29.820]  They're like you're going up the chain buddy
[02:28:29.820 --> 02:28:31.820]  You want a federal job right now
[02:28:31.820 --> 02:28:33.820]  We're going to take this country down
[02:28:33.820 --> 02:28:35.820]  Oh you don't like that you're going to get kicked off the floor
[02:28:35.820 --> 02:28:37.820]  So right now
[02:28:37.820 --> 02:28:39.820]  That's our country
[02:28:39.820 --> 02:28:41.820]  That's what this is all about
[02:28:41.820 --> 02:28:43.820]  They come in there and they're just sitting there
[02:28:43.820 --> 02:28:45.820]  Alright we're going to fry this little kid right now
[02:28:45.820 --> 02:28:47.820]  Yeah
[02:28:47.820 --> 02:28:49.820]  Little kids screaming and pain
[02:28:49.820 --> 02:28:51.820]  Burning stuck to the metal
[02:28:51.820 --> 02:28:53.820]  I'm out of here this is pure evil
[02:28:53.820 --> 02:28:55.820]  Oh really you're going to get died a car wreck next week
[02:28:55.820 --> 02:28:57.820]  Bob oh but all of you that got off on this
[02:28:57.820 --> 02:28:59.820]  Get ready to go upstairs
[02:28:59.820 --> 02:29:01.820]  You're on an elevator going right to the top
[02:29:03.820 --> 02:29:05.820]  TSA
[02:29:05.820 --> 02:29:07.820]  Yeah you like taking women behind closed doors
[02:29:07.820 --> 02:29:09.820]  Sticking your hands down your pants
[02:29:09.820 --> 02:29:11.820]  You're now in charge of this airport
[02:29:11.820 --> 02:29:13.820]  I'm a convicted felon that's why we hired you
[02:29:13.820 --> 02:29:15.820]  Welcome to the team
[02:29:15.820 --> 02:29:17.820]  That's what Stalin
[02:29:17.820 --> 02:29:19.820]  Hitler all of them did
[02:29:19.820 --> 02:29:21.820]  We hired criminals or higher criminal types
[02:29:21.820 --> 02:29:23.820]  And we're now entering that vortex
[02:29:23.820 --> 02:29:25.820]  So all of you that signed on to this system
[02:29:25.820 --> 02:29:27.820]  You like injecting little kids with syphilis
[02:29:27.820 --> 02:29:29.820]  How about polio when they get paralyzed
[02:29:29.820 --> 02:29:31.820]  How about frying kids with radiation
[02:29:31.820 --> 02:29:33.820]  While they scream and cry
[02:29:33.820 --> 02:29:35.820]  And defecate all of themselves
[02:29:35.820 --> 02:29:37.820]  Oh is that what you like? Well that's who you worship
[02:29:37.820 --> 02:29:39.820]  When you sign on to this new world order
[02:29:39.820 --> 02:29:41.820]  You've just signed on to hell
[02:29:41.820 --> 02:29:43.820]  And all that comes with it
[02:29:43.820 --> 02:29:45.820]  Okay I'm going to get to 2012
[02:29:45.820 --> 02:29:47.820]  Then I'll rush through your calls
[02:29:47.820 --> 02:29:49.820]  I'm absolutely telling you why I'm angry at these people
[02:29:49.820 --> 02:29:51.820]  We're on the march
[02:29:51.820 --> 02:29:53.820]  The empire's on the run
[02:29:53.820 --> 02:29:55.820]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network
[02:30:01.820 --> 02:30:03.820]  We have witnessed two terrible storms in the east
[02:30:03.820 --> 02:30:05.820]  But we are still in the eye
[02:30:05.820 --> 02:30:07.820]  Of the perfect storm
[02:30:07.820 --> 02:30:09.820]  The most devastating economic conditions
[02:30:09.820 --> 02:30:11.820]  Since the Great Depression
[02:30:11.820 --> 02:30:13.820]  America's worst drought in agricultural history
[02:30:13.820 --> 02:30:15.820]  And now the economic results of the presidential election
[02:30:15.820 --> 02:30:17.820]  This perfect storm is a huge threat
[02:30:17.820 --> 02:30:19.820]  To everyone's food supply
[02:30:19.820 --> 02:30:21.820]  I just doubled down

[02:30:29.820 --> 02:30:31.820]  Trading my freedom for food
[02:30:31.820 --> 02:30:33.820]  I'm taking control of my future
[02:30:33.820 --> 02:30:35.820]  And you're nuts if you don't do the same

[02:31:01.820 --> 02:31:03.820]  Sodium fluoride in the body
[02:31:03.820 --> 02:31:05.820]  Reduces IQ and increases
[02:31:05.820 --> 02:31:07.820]  Cancers
[02:31:07.820 --> 02:31:09.820]  Unfortunately, fluoride and its derivatives
[02:31:09.820 --> 02:31:11.820]  Are only one of hundreds of toxins
[02:31:11.820 --> 02:31:13.820]  Being added to our drinking water
[02:31:13.820 --> 02:31:15.820]  We're battling the globalist on so many fronts
[02:31:15.820 --> 02:31:17.820]  Health is an area where we can all
[02:31:17.820 --> 02:31:19.820]  Take control of our lives
[02:31:19.820 --> 02:31:21.820]  And it all starts with that basic building block
[02:31:21.820 --> 02:31:23.820]  Of water
[02:31:23.820 --> 02:31:25.820]  It is time to purify our family's water

[02:31:27.820 --> 02:31:29.820]  With added fluoride filters

[02:32:31.820 --> 02:32:33.820]  Entire colonies of harmful bacteria

[02:32:41.820 --> 02:32:43.820]  It is virtually non-toxic

[02:33:09.820 --> 02:33:11.820]  That's been holding for an hour
[02:33:11.820 --> 02:33:13.820]  Michael first and then
[02:33:13.820 --> 02:33:15.820]  Jared and Andrew and Andy

[02:33:19.820 --> 02:33:21.820]  I've got to get into
[02:33:21.820 --> 02:33:23.820]  In the Mayan apocalypse
[02:33:23.820 --> 02:33:25.820]  And we're going to cover them this more in the next few days
[02:33:25.820 --> 02:33:27.820]  With the hard cold facts
[02:33:27.820 --> 02:33:29.820]  We're going to get into that in a moment
[02:33:29.820 --> 02:33:31.820]  First, let's just get through your calls real quick
[02:33:31.820 --> 02:33:33.820]  By the way
[02:33:33.820 --> 02:33:35.820]  When I talked about the Department of Energy
[02:33:35.820 --> 02:33:37.820]  I saw a history channel show
[02:33:37.820 --> 02:33:39.820]  It had to be like 20 years ago
[02:33:39.820 --> 02:33:41.820]  When the history channel was just firing up
[02:33:41.820 --> 02:33:43.820]  And the joke was it was the Hitler channel
[02:33:43.820 --> 02:33:45.820]  Because all they were airing was old World War II films
[02:33:45.820 --> 02:33:47.820]  About the Department of Energy
[02:33:47.820 --> 02:33:49.820]  Trying kids and how the kid
[02:33:49.820 --> 02:33:51.820]  One kid got stuck to it
[02:33:51.820 --> 02:33:53.820]  They cooked them so bad
[02:33:53.820 --> 02:33:55.820]  And that's what they do at those
[02:33:55.820 --> 02:33:57.820]  They sit there and see which scientist
[02:33:57.820 --> 02:33:59.820]  Will get freaked out
[02:33:59.820 --> 02:34:01.820]  And leave or others that go
[02:34:01.820 --> 02:34:03.820]  Well, it's for the greater good
[02:34:03.820 --> 02:34:05.820]  In case we are nuked, we must know what this does
[02:34:05.820 --> 02:34:07.820]  Whereas you could do it
[02:34:07.820 --> 02:34:09.820]  With guinea pigs or whatever
[02:34:09.820 --> 02:34:11.820]  And if you understand secret experimentation
[02:34:11.820 --> 02:34:13.820]  You understand it all
[02:34:13.820 --> 02:34:15.820]  Because we have a global shadow
[02:34:15.820 --> 02:34:17.820]  Corporate government
[02:34:17.820 --> 02:34:19.820]  That of course had to be shadow
[02:34:19.820 --> 02:34:21.820]  To get our money and operate with no oversight
[02:34:21.820 --> 02:34:23.820]  And they are a scientific
[02:34:23.820 --> 02:34:25.820]  Guild
[02:34:25.820 --> 02:34:27.820]  Attempting to attain
[02:34:27.820 --> 02:34:29.820]  Extended life
[02:34:29.820 --> 02:34:31.820]  With high tech systems
[02:34:31.820 --> 02:34:33.820]  They do not wish to be transferred to the public
[02:34:33.820 --> 02:34:35.820]  Any technology allowed to be
[02:34:35.820 --> 02:34:37.820]  Transferred to us
[02:34:37.820 --> 02:34:39.820]  Any iPhone
[02:34:39.820 --> 02:34:41.820]  Any Android
[02:34:41.820 --> 02:34:43.820]  Any computer, any TV, any cable box
[02:34:43.820 --> 02:34:45.820]  Any DVR
[02:34:45.820 --> 02:34:47.820]  Is an NSA global spy tool
[02:34:47.820 --> 02:34:49.820]  They're all Trojan horses
[02:34:49.820 --> 02:34:51.820]  You're not given anything
[02:34:51.820 --> 02:34:53.820]  Not any medicine, not anything
[02:34:53.820 --> 02:34:55.820]  Unless it's meant to hurt you
[02:34:55.820 --> 02:34:57.820]  Because you are seen as a plague
[02:34:57.820 --> 02:34:59.820]  As a virus
[02:34:59.820 --> 02:35:01.820]  That has to be exterminated
[02:35:01.820 --> 02:35:03.820]  And you see them in the news saying that
[02:35:03.820 --> 02:35:05.820]  Telling you, you're all going to die soon
[02:35:05.820 --> 02:35:07.820]  The megapleg will be released
[02:35:07.820 --> 02:35:09.820]  But it will be an accident, you're prepared to die now
[02:35:09.820 --> 02:35:11.820]  And you understand it's for the better
[02:35:11.820 --> 02:35:13.820]  You're being prepped for this
[02:35:13.820 --> 02:35:15.820]  And so I
[02:35:15.820 --> 02:35:17.820]  In a way, I hope all of you that serve this evil
[02:35:17.820 --> 02:35:19.820]  Enjoy yourselves
[02:35:19.820 --> 02:35:21.820]  Because
[02:35:21.820 --> 02:35:23.820]  If the globalists decide to pull the trigger on this
[02:35:23.820 --> 02:35:25.820]  And we're trying to stop them by getting the word out
[02:35:27.820 --> 02:35:29.820]  You're dead
[02:35:29.820 --> 02:35:31.820]  And I wish that you'd wake up
[02:35:31.820 --> 02:35:33.820]  Before they kill you
[02:35:33.820 --> 02:35:35.820]  Because here's the deal, they could launch
[02:35:35.820 --> 02:35:37.820]  What will be the end of the world
[02:35:37.820 --> 02:35:39.820]  For you individually
[02:35:39.820 --> 02:35:41.820]  At any time
[02:35:41.820 --> 02:35:43.820]  If you get run over by a carman, that's the end of the world for you
[02:35:43.820 --> 02:35:45.820]  It's old saying about depression
[02:35:45.820 --> 02:35:47.820]  You know, one man's
[02:35:47.820 --> 02:35:49.820]  Depression is another man's recession
[02:35:49.820 --> 02:35:51.820]  Because if you're been out of a job for a year
[02:35:51.820 --> 02:35:53.820]  Or you had to take a job that paid you
[02:35:53.820 --> 02:35:55.820]  A third of what you were paid, you know, that's a depression
[02:35:59.820 --> 02:36:01.820]  And they cooked these numbers out of Washington
[02:36:01.820 --> 02:36:03.820]  It's admitted their total frauds
[02:36:03.820 --> 02:36:05.820]  They've never been this fraudulent
[02:36:05.820 --> 02:36:07.820]  And yeah, people are waking up
[02:36:07.820 --> 02:36:09.820]  I see Heritage Foundation ads on TV
[02:36:09.820 --> 02:36:11.820]  I see these ads everywhere
[02:36:11.820 --> 02:36:13.820]  On television, when I monitor it
[02:36:13.820 --> 02:36:15.820]  And online, where America's gonna be all right
[02:36:15.820 --> 02:36:17.820]  Here's Ronald Reagan, you know, we're gonna make it
[02:36:17.820 --> 02:36:19.820]  You know, Thanksgiving's great
[02:36:19.820 --> 02:36:21.820]  Brought to you by JPMorgan
[02:36:21.820 --> 02:36:23.820]  They want you to be positive
[02:36:23.820 --> 02:36:25.820]  So while they're killing you
[02:36:25.820 --> 02:36:27.820]  You'll feel like everything's okay
[02:36:27.820 --> 02:36:29.820]  Well, why don't you globalists just release
[02:36:29.820 --> 02:36:31.820]  A nerve gas that makes us feel euphoric
[02:36:31.820 --> 02:36:33.820]  While we die
[02:36:33.820 --> 02:36:37.820]  You know, it's basically the same thing
[02:36:37.820 --> 02:36:39.820]  You know
[02:36:39.820 --> 02:36:41.820]  It's just so sick
[02:36:41.820 --> 02:36:43.820]  And it's a bunch of competing agendas
[02:36:43.820 --> 02:36:45.820]  Even within the power structure
[02:36:45.820 --> 02:36:47.820]  But whatever the most evil technology
[02:36:47.820 --> 02:36:49.820]  Is of control, it will be seized on
[02:36:49.820 --> 02:36:51.820]  By someone in the structure
[02:36:51.820 --> 02:36:53.820]  They will immediately be accelerated
[02:36:53.820 --> 02:36:55.820]  To the throne room of power
[02:36:55.820 --> 02:36:57.820]  And then only the next most cunning
[02:36:57.820 --> 02:36:59.820]  Combine will replace them
[02:36:59.820 --> 02:37:01.820]  Until you have pure
[02:37:01.820 --> 02:37:03.820]  Crystalline destruction in charge
[02:37:07.820 --> 02:37:09.820]  Okay, Michael, did that answer your question
[02:37:09.820 --> 02:37:11.820]  From earlier? Go ahead, you got 30 seconds
[02:37:11.820 --> 02:37:13.820]  Yeah, that does answer the question
[02:37:13.820 --> 02:37:15.820]  And hopefully you do an analysis
[02:37:15.820 --> 02:37:17.820]  On the fiscal clip
[02:37:17.820 --> 02:37:19.820]  That Obama's talking about
[02:37:19.820 --> 02:37:21.820]  From this year and the one from last year
[02:37:21.820 --> 02:37:23.820]  Where he's talking about cutting our budget
[02:37:23.820 --> 02:37:25.820]  And adding the science and stuff like that
[02:37:25.820 --> 02:37:27.820]  Yeah, thank you, sir
[02:37:27.820 --> 02:37:29.820]  It's all total lies and propaganda
[02:37:29.820 --> 02:37:31.820]  And if you're going to get a fine share of it
[02:37:31.820 --> 02:37:33.820]  Goes to foreign banks
[02:37:33.820 --> 02:37:35.820]  And the next largest share of the defense
[02:37:35.820 --> 02:37:37.820]  And the third largest share in entitlements
[02:37:37.820 --> 02:37:39.820]  To keep people dependent
[02:37:39.820 --> 02:37:41.820]  I mean, it's that simple
[02:37:41.820 --> 02:37:43.820]  Make it where you don't know how to catch fish
[02:37:43.820 --> 02:37:45.820]  You got to get fish from them
[02:37:45.820 --> 02:37:47.820]  Make it where you're totally dependent
[02:37:47.820 --> 02:37:49.820]  And even though they're going to cut, cut, cut, cut, cut
[02:37:49.820 --> 02:37:51.820]  With inflation, how much you really get
[02:37:51.820 --> 02:37:53.820]  And your standard's going to go down of living
[02:37:53.820 --> 02:37:55.820]  You'll still only see the government
[02:37:55.820 --> 02:37:57.820]  As where you can make it
[02:37:57.820 --> 02:37:59.820]  And that's every authoritarian wants to do that
[02:37:59.820 --> 02:38:01.820]  Because it makes you dependent
[02:38:01.820 --> 02:38:03.820]  Jared in Colorado, thanks for holding her on the air
[02:38:03.820 --> 02:38:05.820]  Hey Alex
[02:38:05.820 --> 02:38:07.820]  It's Jared from FEMA Region 8
[02:38:07.820 --> 02:38:09.820]  I just was called
[02:38:09.820 --> 02:38:11.820]  With a great show
[02:38:11.820 --> 02:38:13.820]  There's a few things I wanted to talk about today
[02:38:13.820 --> 02:38:15.820]  One was about guns
[02:38:15.820 --> 02:38:17.820]  Two years ago when I first started with PU
[02:38:17.820 --> 02:38:19.820]  I actually
[02:38:19.820 --> 02:38:21.820]  Didn't have a gun, I was listening to you saying
[02:38:21.820 --> 02:38:23.820]  That they're coming out for a gun, so I went and got some
[02:38:23.820 --> 02:38:25.820]  I really enjoyed the Brothers in Arms
[02:38:25.820 --> 02:38:27.820]  Sections that you're doing
[02:38:27.820 --> 02:38:29.820]  When do you think you're going to be doing in next Brothers in Arms?
[02:38:29.820 --> 02:38:31.820]  Alright, here's the problem
[02:38:31.820 --> 02:38:33.820]  Shane Steiner, Sid Steiner want to do it
[02:38:33.820 --> 02:38:35.820]  We want to do it
[02:38:35.820 --> 02:38:37.820]  There's the obvious liability issues
[02:38:37.820 --> 02:38:39.820]  Of doing shows with firearms
[02:38:39.820 --> 02:38:41.820]  But I can do the waivers
[02:38:41.820 --> 02:38:43.820]  I just had to look at everything
[02:38:43.820 --> 02:38:45.820]  And for now at least decide
[02:38:45.820 --> 02:38:47.820]  That there's so many other big things
[02:38:47.820 --> 02:38:49.820]  Like I love going out and shooting guns
[02:38:49.820 --> 02:38:51.820]  But
[02:38:51.820 --> 02:38:53.820]  I've got a 50 cal, I haven't shot yet
[02:38:53.820 --> 02:38:55.820]  And it's awesome going out on the Steiner's
[02:38:55.820 --> 02:38:57.820]  12,000 acre ranch, those guys are the coolest guys
[02:38:57.820 --> 02:38:59.820]  You can hang around with, just real people
[02:38:59.820 --> 02:39:01.820]  You know, like 8th generation rodeo
[02:39:01.820 --> 02:39:03.820]  Or something, it's just unbelievable
[02:39:03.820 --> 02:39:05.820]  Just good people, as good as it gets
[02:39:05.820 --> 02:39:07.820]  I just don't ever have to, but yes
[02:39:07.820 --> 02:39:09.820]  We plan on doing the show down the road
[02:39:09.820 --> 02:39:11.820]  And more gun reviews and things
[02:39:13.820 --> 02:39:15.820]  Listen, here's the deal
[02:39:15.820 --> 02:39:17.820]  I'm not here to just make money
[02:39:17.820 --> 02:39:19.820]  If I wanted to just make money, I could go
[02:39:19.820 --> 02:39:21.820]  Promote it and pack 5,000
[02:39:21.820 --> 02:39:23.820]  Room halls out
[02:39:23.820 --> 02:39:25.820]  And charge people $300 ahead
[02:39:25.820 --> 02:39:27.820]  Like Len Beck does and fly around a private jet
[02:39:27.820 --> 02:39:29.820]  I just, it horrifies me
[02:39:33.820 --> 02:39:35.820]  But you can't go rent that hall
[02:39:35.820 --> 02:39:37.820]  If you don't charge people at least 50 bucks
[02:39:37.820 --> 02:39:39.820]  Because then you lose money
[02:39:39.820 --> 02:39:41.820]  So it's a catch 22
[02:39:41.820 --> 02:39:43.820]  I've had all these biggest book deals
[02:39:43.820 --> 02:39:45.820]  Biggest publishers in the country
[02:39:45.820 --> 02:39:47.820]  I say all like 7 or 8 of them
[02:39:47.820 --> 02:39:49.820]  Come and say, okay, you want
[02:39:49.820 --> 02:39:51.820]  To sign up
[02:39:51.820 --> 02:39:53.820]  Retainer
[02:39:53.820 --> 02:39:55.820]  We'll get you the right ghost writer
[02:39:55.820 --> 02:39:57.820]  And before I had a smaller publisher years ago
[02:39:57.820 --> 02:39:59.820]  And just the ghost writers we had
[02:39:59.820 --> 02:40:01.820]  It was not accurate
[02:40:01.820 --> 02:40:03.820]  And I was like, no, I don't have time to write books
[02:40:03.820 --> 02:40:05.820]  I mean, let's say, I put out a book
[02:40:05.820 --> 02:40:07.820]  That a million people read
[02:40:07.820 --> 02:40:09.820]  And I make $5 million
[02:40:09.820 --> 02:40:11.820]  I don't want $5 million
[02:40:13.820 --> 02:40:15.820]  Just to have $5 million
[02:40:15.820 --> 02:40:17.820]  I'm going to put him on hold and explain this
[02:40:17.820 --> 02:40:19.820]  I got to get into this 2012 issue
[02:40:19.820 --> 02:40:21.820]  So you ask questions that are
[02:40:21.820 --> 02:40:23.820]  But then I realize
[02:40:23.820 --> 02:40:25.820]  If I go do events with 5,000 people
[02:40:25.820 --> 02:40:27.820]  And I land in a jet
[02:40:27.820 --> 02:40:29.820]  And I show it
[02:40:29.820 --> 02:40:31.820]  And I go out and I speak
[02:40:31.820 --> 02:40:33.820]  And I get Hollywood people I know to come be part of it
[02:40:33.820 --> 02:40:35.820]  Then the mainstream media will see it
[02:40:35.820 --> 02:40:37.820]  And then I'll be anointed
[02:40:37.820 --> 02:40:39.820]  And seen as this big star
[02:40:39.820 --> 02:40:41.820]  It's like you, that's why I guess
[02:40:41.820 --> 02:40:43.820]  If you want, I'll wear a suit and tie
[02:40:43.820 --> 02:40:45.820]  I guess if people want me to fly on a private jet
[02:40:45.820 --> 02:40:47.820]  I can go make the money to do it
[02:40:47.820 --> 02:40:49.820]  Snap my fingers and do it
[02:40:49.820 --> 02:40:51.820]  Snap my fingers
[02:40:51.820 --> 02:40:53.820]  And charge people $100 to come hear me speak
[02:40:53.820 --> 02:40:55.820]  All day long and speak to thousands
[02:40:55.820 --> 02:40:57.820]  Any city, any time, boom
[02:40:57.820 --> 02:40:59.820]  Done it over and over again
[02:40:59.820 --> 02:41:01.820]  But I charge $10, $20
[02:41:01.820 --> 02:41:03.820]  And then give half the money to local radio stations
[02:41:03.820 --> 02:41:05.820]  Stuff like that
[02:41:05.820 --> 02:41:07.820]  And then I abhor, it's horrifying
[02:41:07.820 --> 02:41:09.820]  To think of going up on a stage
[02:41:09.820 --> 02:41:11.820]  With 5,000 people worshiping you
[02:41:11.820 --> 02:41:13.820]  And again, I love them
[02:41:13.820 --> 02:41:15.820]  But I get more
[02:41:15.820 --> 02:41:17.820]  Reclusive by the day
[02:41:17.820 --> 02:41:19.820]  I'm just going to be honest
[02:41:19.820 --> 02:41:21.820]  I just don't like it
[02:41:21.820 --> 02:41:23.820]  I want to sit around here at my office
[02:41:23.820 --> 02:41:25.820]  Making films and doing things
[02:41:25.820 --> 02:41:27.820]  I bought real laser beams
[02:41:27.820 --> 02:41:29.820]  And I've got something coming out
[02:41:29.820 --> 02:41:31.820]  Nobody's done this week or next week
[02:41:31.820 --> 02:41:33.820]  And I'm not even
[02:41:33.820 --> 02:41:35.820]  Going to explain it to people
[02:41:35.820 --> 02:41:37.820]  It's pretty ridiculous when you see this
[02:41:37.820 --> 02:41:39.820]  Anyways
[02:41:39.820 --> 02:41:41.820]  I want to
[02:41:41.820 --> 02:41:43.820]  And again
[02:41:43.820 --> 02:41:45.820]  You raise a point
[02:41:45.820 --> 02:41:47.820]  It's just something I'm thinking about
[02:41:47.820 --> 02:41:49.820]  Like
[02:41:49.820 --> 02:41:51.820]  I don't think that Glenn Beck
[02:41:51.820 --> 02:41:53.820]  Has my phones tapped
[02:41:53.820 --> 02:41:55.820]  I know for a fact from people that worked at Fox News
[02:41:55.820 --> 02:41:57.820]  And were in and around Mercury Media
[02:41:57.820 --> 02:41:59.820]  That they had guys, like 5 guys assigned
[02:41:59.820 --> 02:42:01.820]  To tracking our show and what we do
[02:42:01.820 --> 02:42:03.820]  And I see they take what we do and change it
[02:42:03.820 --> 02:42:05.820]  And make it profitable and do all this stuff
[02:42:05.820 --> 02:42:07.820]  That's fine, I hope Glenn Beck makes $10,000,000
[02:42:07.820 --> 02:42:09.820]  I don't like the fact that Glenn Beck
[02:42:09.820 --> 02:42:11.820]  Going over again, people are like
[02:42:11.820 --> 02:42:13.820]  I can't come on your show or Glenn Beck won't have me on
[02:42:13.820 --> 02:42:15.820]  They say
[02:42:15.820 --> 02:42:17.820]  Or a sponsor, well you ought to hear what Glenn Beck was saying
[02:42:17.820 --> 02:42:19.820]  Or Fox News people
[02:42:19.820 --> 02:42:21.820]  Well, I was going to have you on, but Glenn Beck's going to throw a fifth
[02:42:21.820 --> 02:42:23.820]  He says
[02:42:23.820 --> 02:42:25.820]  Or Glenn Beck acting like
[02:42:25.820 --> 02:42:27.820]  I made something up about him
[02:42:27.820 --> 02:42:29.820]  Or Glenn Beck implying that
[02:42:29.820 --> 02:42:31.820]  Just out of the blue
[02:42:31.820 --> 02:42:33.820]  People said Charlie Sheen didn't go to the hospital
[02:42:33.820 --> 02:42:35.820]  Over a hernia
[02:42:35.820 --> 02:42:37.820]  And I had to know that he had to go in and have surgery
[02:42:37.820 --> 02:42:39.820]  And we had a shirt off out of the pool
[02:42:39.820 --> 02:42:41.820]  And I go, man, I've seen your hernia
[02:42:41.820 --> 02:42:43.820]  You did go to the hospital because of that
[02:42:43.820 --> 02:42:45.820]  Oh, I've seen your hernia, they were in the shower having sex together
[02:42:45.820 --> 02:42:47.820]  You know, just like, man, what is your problem?
[02:42:47.820 --> 02:42:49.820]  You were saying Glenn Beck
[02:42:49.820 --> 02:42:51.820]  I mean, you were saying that Ron Paul
[02:42:51.820 --> 02:42:53.820]  Was a piece of garbage
[02:42:53.820 --> 02:42:55.820]  And the army should be used against him
[02:42:55.820 --> 02:42:57.820]  And there's no FEMA camps
[02:42:57.820 --> 02:42:59.820]  And all this stuff
[02:42:59.820 --> 02:43:01.820]  Just three years ago, four years ago
[02:43:01.820 --> 02:43:03.820]  Or less
[02:43:03.820 --> 02:43:05.820]  And then now you go co-op the Liberty Convention
[02:43:05.820 --> 02:43:07.820]  And all these Hollywood stars
[02:43:07.820 --> 02:43:09.820]  That I happen to know were listeners of mine
[02:43:09.820 --> 02:43:11.820]  Is it some of the same folks
[02:43:11.820 --> 02:43:13.820]  That run in the whole Joe Rogan circle
[02:43:13.820 --> 02:43:15.820]  In that whole Hollywood troupe
[02:43:15.820 --> 02:43:17.820]  And then it's
[02:43:17.820 --> 02:43:19.820]  Doing shows with Glenn Beck
[02:43:19.820 --> 02:43:21.820]  It's like, you try to hold me down
[02:43:21.820 --> 02:43:23.820]  You try to destroy Ron Paul
[02:43:23.820 --> 02:43:25.820]  And then you go get Vince Vaughn
[02:43:25.820 --> 02:43:27.820]  Who's this big Ron Paul supporter and starting to wake up
[02:43:27.820 --> 02:43:29.820]  And go get him over for you
[02:43:29.820 --> 02:43:31.820]  That ruins me watching your success
[02:43:31.820 --> 02:43:33.820]  And then evil parts of me go, well, I'll just go charge
[02:43:33.820 --> 02:43:35.820]  $300 for people to see me
[02:43:35.820 --> 02:43:37.820]  Speak and I'll fly around in a private jet
[02:43:37.820 --> 02:43:39.820]  And show everybody and then I'll go do
[02:43:39.820 --> 02:43:41.820]  All these book deals and I'll go have
[02:43:41.820 --> 02:43:43.820]  An imprint and I'll show Glenn Beck
[02:43:43.820 --> 02:43:45.820]  Maybe I'll sell out and go on national TV
[02:43:45.820 --> 02:43:47.820]  But I already had those offers
[02:43:47.820 --> 02:43:49.820]  Before Glenn Beck even came along
[02:43:49.820 --> 02:43:51.820]  Again, Glenn Beck
[02:43:51.820 --> 02:43:53.820]  Is not even on my radar screen
[02:43:53.820 --> 02:43:55.820]  Except for the fact that I know
[02:43:55.820 --> 02:43:57.820]  He's there working behind the scenes against me
[02:43:57.820 --> 02:43:59.820]  And then becoming
[02:43:59.820 --> 02:44:01.820]  And siphoning everything
[02:44:01.820 --> 02:44:03.820]  And twisting what I've done
[02:44:03.820 --> 02:44:05.820]  That is what I can't stand about Glenn Beck
[02:44:05.820 --> 02:44:07.820]  Now, I've just gone off on a whole
[02:44:07.820 --> 02:44:09.820]  Jag because he announced that I was on
[02:44:09.820 --> 02:44:11.820]  Drudge Report last week on air
[02:44:11.820 --> 02:44:13.820]  Reading headlines and I saw this reality show
[02:44:13.820 --> 02:44:15.820]  I wouldn't do a reality show, they'll twist it
[02:44:15.820 --> 02:44:17.820]  I'd know it was him doing his own
[02:44:17.820 --> 02:44:19.820]  And then I started reading it
[02:44:19.820 --> 02:44:21.820]  And I'm like, I'll be
[02:44:21.820 --> 02:44:23.820]  A ball-headed monkey's uncle
[02:44:23.820 --> 02:44:25.820]  That's not the exact idea I talked
[02:44:25.820 --> 02:44:27.820]  About privately
[02:44:27.820 --> 02:44:29.820]  But that is something I was planning on announcing
[02:44:29.820 --> 02:44:31.820]  The first, basically something similar
[02:44:31.820 --> 02:44:33.820]  Well, you know we have
[02:44:33.820 --> 02:44:35.820]  Contest over documentaries and contests
[02:44:35.820 --> 02:44:37.820]  And I was building a studio
[02:44:37.820 --> 02:44:39.820]  So we could have studio audiences and looking
[02:44:39.820 --> 02:44:41.820]  At places to do it in Austin and things
[02:44:41.820 --> 02:44:43.820]  And I'm just like, you know, I don't think
[02:44:43.820 --> 02:44:45.820]  They've got my phones tapped even though
[02:44:45.820 --> 02:44:47.820]  Even though he's moved to Dallas
[02:44:47.820 --> 02:44:49.820]  And had people down here looking at houses
[02:44:49.820 --> 02:44:51.820]  In Austin near where I live
[02:44:51.820 --> 02:44:53.820]  And even though I know he's got five guys
[02:44:53.820 --> 02:44:55.820]  At least back in the old days watching what I do
[02:44:55.820 --> 02:44:57.820]  It is kind of creepville though
[02:44:57.820 --> 02:44:59.820]  I mean, but maybe it's just that
[02:44:59.820 --> 02:45:01.820]  He's copied me so much
[02:45:01.820 --> 02:45:03.820]  And moved into the quote model we have
[02:45:03.820 --> 02:45:05.820]  Our models just get the word out
[02:45:05.820 --> 02:45:07.820]  Any way you can that that's what's happening
[02:45:07.820 --> 02:45:09.820]  And see, I just went into that whole thought area
[02:45:09.820 --> 02:45:11.820]  Of my brain because I then read
[02:45:11.820 --> 02:45:13.820]  The whole thing and I was like, what?
[02:45:13.820 --> 02:45:15.820]  I mean, I better just announce
[02:45:15.820 --> 02:45:17.820]  Everything here on air before
[02:45:17.820 --> 02:45:19.820]  He does it
[02:45:19.820 --> 02:45:21.820]  Because you know I sort of put in clothes
[02:45:21.820 --> 02:45:23.820]  Out a few years ago, I was looking at designer
[02:45:23.820 --> 02:45:25.820]  Made in America jeans, I guess that's common sense
[02:45:25.820 --> 02:45:27.820]  Nobody's making jeans in America, why shouldn't I?
[02:45:27.820 --> 02:45:29.820]  Boom, he does it
[02:45:29.820 --> 02:45:31.820]  Just announced now I'm going to come out with Alex Jones' art
[02:45:31.820 --> 02:45:33.820]  And prints, okay, so down the road
[02:45:33.820 --> 02:45:35.820]  When he does it, you know, I said it first
[02:45:35.820 --> 02:45:37.820]  Kind of like Internet TV
[02:45:37.820 --> 02:45:39.820]  All the rest of it, and I'm not, you know
[02:45:39.820 --> 02:45:41.820]  The truth lives here, Glenn, the truth doesn't live with you
[02:45:41.820 --> 02:45:43.820]  And listen, I'm glad that he's
[02:45:43.820 --> 02:45:45.820]  Becoming more and more Alex Jones
[02:45:45.820 --> 02:45:47.820]  Like I said, I influence these people and that's a good thing
[02:45:47.820 --> 02:45:49.820]  I just don't like the working against me
[02:45:49.820 --> 02:45:51.820]  And then acting like I'm working against him
[02:45:51.820 --> 02:45:53.820]  Now I've gone off into a pointless Glenn Beck rant
[02:45:53.820 --> 02:45:55.820]  It's just
[02:45:55.820 --> 02:45:57.820]  He tried to bring down Ron Paul as hard
[02:45:57.820 --> 02:45:59.820]  As he could, Ron Paul called him a demagogue
[02:45:59.820 --> 02:46:01.820]  And then I happened to know
[02:46:01.820 --> 02:46:03.820]  That Glenn Beck, from my sources
[02:46:03.820 --> 02:46:05.820]  Has approached the Ron Paul camp about some stuff
[02:46:05.820 --> 02:46:07.820]  And again, if I trusted him
[02:46:07.820 --> 02:46:09.820]  If he came out and said, I'm sorry for attacking Ron Paul
[02:46:09.820 --> 02:46:11.820]  I was wrong
[02:46:11.820 --> 02:46:13.820]  And if he apologized about
[02:46:13.820 --> 02:46:15.820]  Stuff he's done to other people
[02:46:15.820 --> 02:46:17.820]  Like me, then I would be happy
[02:46:17.820 --> 02:46:19.820]  For his success, but let me tell you
[02:46:19.820 --> 02:46:21.820]  Success at my expense
[02:46:21.820 --> 02:46:23.820]  Makes me really angry
[02:46:23.820 --> 02:46:25.820]  I'll just leave it at that
[02:46:25.820 --> 02:46:27.820]  And I'm totally ranting now
[02:46:29.820 --> 02:46:31.820]  Okay, callers, thank you, I'll try to get to other callers
[02:46:31.820 --> 02:46:33.820]  After I cover this whole 2012 thing
[02:46:33.820 --> 02:46:35.820]  I will say we're going to announce
[02:46:35.820 --> 02:46:37.820]  Something really big
[02:46:37.820 --> 02:46:39.820]  On Friday, I've got to accelerate this now
[02:46:39.820 --> 02:46:41.820]  Because I tend to get procrastinate
[02:46:41.820 --> 02:46:43.820]  I'm going to announce something
[02:46:43.820 --> 02:46:45.820]  The biggest thing we've ever done contest-wise
[02:46:45.820 --> 02:46:47.820]  I haven't decided if it's going to be
[02:46:47.820 --> 02:46:49.820]  $100,000 prize or $200,000 prize
[02:46:49.820 --> 02:46:51.820]  On Friday
[02:46:51.820 --> 02:46:53.820]  And by the way, that's just the first prize
[02:46:55.820 --> 02:46:57.820]  I'm thinking about making it a million
[02:46:59.820 --> 02:47:01.820]  And I got to say it quick
[02:47:01.820 --> 02:47:03.820]  In case they do have my phones tapped
[02:47:03.820 --> 02:47:05.820]  I don't have proof of that, but it's crazy
[02:47:05.820 --> 02:47:07.820]  Or maybe the NSA gets the data
[02:47:07.820 --> 02:47:09.820]  And then obviously he's been a government op
[02:47:09.820 --> 02:47:11.820]  In the past, they give it to him
[02:47:11.820 --> 02:47:13.820]  I've got to say everything I'm planning
[02:47:13.820 --> 02:47:15.820]  Immediately on air now
[02:47:15.820 --> 02:47:17.820]  Because there's nothing worse than having an idea
[02:47:17.820 --> 02:47:19.820]  What anybody else does it
[02:47:19.820 --> 02:47:21.820]  But five guys invented radio the same week
[02:47:21.820 --> 02:47:23.820]  They all got their invention out at the same time
[02:47:23.820 --> 02:47:25.820]  Marconi amongst themselves
[02:47:25.820 --> 02:47:27.820]  That may be what it is, great minds think alike
[02:47:27.820 --> 02:47:29.820]  But let me tell you, it's getting weird
[02:47:29.820 --> 02:47:31.820]  I just think God, he didn't get a house in Austin
[02:47:31.820 --> 02:47:33.820]  And got one in Dallas
[02:47:33.820 --> 02:47:35.820]  This town's not big enough for the two of us
[02:47:35.820 --> 02:47:37.820]  And I could go into the whole list
[02:47:37.820 --> 02:47:39.820]  Of just the terms, the specials
[02:47:39.820 --> 02:47:41.820]  The way we promote things
[02:47:41.820 --> 02:47:43.820]  Just everything
[02:47:43.820 --> 02:47:45.820]  Here's a guy worth hundreds of millions of dollars
[02:47:45.820 --> 02:47:47.820]  Who is literally
[02:47:47.820 --> 02:47:49.820]  Sucking everything out of this operation
[02:47:49.820 --> 02:47:51.820]  And then twisting it
[02:47:51.820 --> 02:47:53.820]  When it comes out the other dirty end
[02:47:53.820 --> 02:47:55.820]  Alright, excuse me
[02:47:55.820 --> 02:47:57.820]  We're going to skip this network break right here
[02:47:57.820 --> 02:47:59.820]  I've got to do this and start over
[02:47:59.820 --> 02:48:01.820]  See, callers bring up something
[02:48:01.820 --> 02:48:03.820]  And then it's like, boop, a champagne cork pops
[02:48:03.820 --> 02:48:05.820]  And out sprays the contents
[02:48:05.820 --> 02:48:07.820]  They bring up something
[02:48:07.820 --> 02:48:09.820]  And then a whole data area that I've got
[02:48:09.820 --> 02:48:11.820]  In fact, I shouldn't even have got into that on air
[02:48:11.820 --> 02:48:13.820]  Because I get guilty
[02:48:13.820 --> 02:48:15.820]  Even though I know it's not envy or jealousy
[02:48:15.820 --> 02:48:17.820]  Because that's the worst thing for me
[02:48:17.820 --> 02:48:19.820]  That's not big in my mind
[02:48:21.820 --> 02:48:23.820]  It's kind of like the jungle song
[02:48:23.820 --> 02:48:25.820]  You can have anything you want
[02:48:25.820 --> 02:48:27.820]  But you better not take it from me
[02:48:27.820 --> 02:48:29.820]  You know what I mean?
[02:48:29.820 --> 02:48:31.820]  Alright, here we go, ladies and gentlemen
[02:48:31.820 --> 02:48:33.820]  Let me just smile on that, CJ
[02:48:37.820 --> 02:48:39.820]  Oh, you're still blasted?
[02:48:39.820 --> 02:48:43.820]  Think it ought to be a million dollar prize?
[02:48:43.820 --> 02:48:45.820]  Well, that'll exhaust some of our funds
[02:48:45.820 --> 02:48:47.820]  Yeah, well, it'll certainly get the word out
[02:48:47.820 --> 02:48:49.820]  Wait till I... No, no, we need the million
[02:48:49.820 --> 02:48:51.820]  To fund the winner
[02:48:51.820 --> 02:48:53.820]  You see
[02:48:53.820 --> 02:48:55.820]  Because see, winning the prize
[02:48:55.820 --> 02:48:57.820]  Is just the beginning
[02:48:57.820 --> 02:48:59.820]  Well, that's what Glenn Beck's doing
[02:48:59.820 --> 02:49:01.820]  But you'll hear it from my perspective
[02:49:01.820 --> 02:49:03.820]  What I was going to do, what I told people about
[02:49:03.820 --> 02:49:05.820]  You know, hey, we ought to do this
[02:49:05.820 --> 02:49:07.820]  It doesn't matter
[02:49:07.820 --> 02:49:09.820]  No surveillance of this operation
[02:49:11.820 --> 02:49:13.820]  I'm sure the system wouldn't
[02:49:13.820 --> 02:49:15.820]  Create a counterfeit
[02:49:15.820 --> 02:49:17.820]  I'm sure
[02:49:17.820 --> 02:49:19.820]  That I go out on the street and almost every
[02:49:19.820 --> 02:49:21.820]  Person I walk by is now a listener
[02:49:21.820 --> 02:49:23.820]  Or watches us online one way or another
[02:49:23.820 --> 02:49:25.820]  I mean, I'm sure that no one's
[02:49:25.820 --> 02:49:27.820]  Co-opting that
[02:49:27.820 --> 02:49:29.820]  I'm sure that's happening
[02:49:29.820 --> 02:49:31.820]  Oh, man
[02:49:33.820 --> 02:49:35.820]  And folks, you know me
[02:49:35.820 --> 02:49:37.820]  I don't get up here and bash on Limbaugh
[02:49:37.820 --> 02:49:39.820]  I don't get up here and bash on Savage
[02:49:39.820 --> 02:49:41.820]  I don't get up and bash these guys
[02:49:41.820 --> 02:49:43.820]  Sometimes, you know, when Limbaugh's saying
[02:49:43.820 --> 02:49:45.820]  I arrest people that do drugs, I'm like, come on, dude
[02:49:45.820 --> 02:49:47.820]  He doesn't do that as much now
[02:49:47.820 --> 02:49:49.820]  I'm like, come on, that's pretty hypocritical
[02:49:49.820 --> 02:49:51.820]  But I'm not in competition with him
[02:49:51.820 --> 02:49:53.820]  But Glenn Beck has taken this really creepy interest in me
[02:49:53.820 --> 02:49:55.820]  And has tried to hurt me
[02:49:55.820 --> 02:49:57.820]  And
[02:49:59.820 --> 02:50:01.820]  I don't want to hurt Glenn Beck
[02:50:01.820 --> 02:50:03.820]  But
[02:50:03.820 --> 02:50:05.820]  I don't want those to really
[02:50:05.820 --> 02:50:07.820]  Making a short film about him
[02:50:07.820 --> 02:50:09.820]  That
[02:50:09.820 --> 02:50:11.820]  We'll go directly at your audience, which is my audience
[02:50:11.820 --> 02:50:13.820]  So I know you're all about
[02:50:13.820 --> 02:50:15.820]  Dollars and cents
[02:50:15.820 --> 02:50:17.820]  Buddy who brags about, you know, hanging out with Bill Gates
[02:50:17.820 --> 02:50:19.820]  Or whatever, I'll get you to say his name on air
[02:50:19.820 --> 02:50:21.820]  The point is, just get off my back
[02:50:21.820 --> 02:50:23.820]  I'm telling you right now
[02:50:23.820 --> 02:50:25.820]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen
[02:50:25.820 --> 02:50:27.820]  Let's go ahead and get into
[02:50:29.820 --> 02:50:31.820]  Let's get into what's happening
[02:50:31.820 --> 02:50:33.820]  With the
[02:50:33.820 --> 02:50:35.820]  Mayan calendar
[02:50:35.820 --> 02:50:37.820]  First off, let me get to
[02:50:37.820 --> 02:50:39.820]  This report right here
[02:50:39.820 --> 02:50:41.820]  On the document cam for viewers
[02:50:41.820 --> 02:50:43.820]  David Stewart is
[02:50:43.820 --> 02:50:45.820]  In the top four or five
[02:50:45.820 --> 02:50:47.820]  Mayanist, as they're called
[02:50:47.820 --> 02:50:49.820]  In the United States
[02:50:49.820 --> 02:50:51.820]  He's at the University of Texas
[02:50:51.820 --> 02:50:53.820]  Disciples
[02:50:53.820 --> 02:50:55.820]  Meaning of newly discovered monument
[02:50:55.820 --> 02:50:57.820]  That refers to 2012
[02:50:57.820 --> 02:50:59.820]  And it says
[02:50:59.820 --> 02:51:01.820]  Mayan used to date
[02:51:01.820 --> 02:51:03.820]  Simply as a literary device
[02:51:03.820 --> 02:51:05.820]  He grew up with parents that were archaeologists
[02:51:05.820 --> 02:51:07.820]  In the Yucatan Peninsula
[02:51:07.820 --> 02:51:09.820]  And the base in there in Mexico City
[02:51:09.820 --> 02:51:11.820]  In other areas
[02:51:11.820 --> 02:51:13.820]  He is world-renowned
[02:51:13.820 --> 02:51:15.820]  Mayanist archaeologist
[02:51:15.820 --> 02:51:17.820]  And he says
[02:51:17.820 --> 02:51:19.820]  It is simply the date
[02:51:19.820 --> 02:51:21.820]  To mean a new calendar begins
[02:51:21.820 --> 02:51:23.820]  Or the end of an age
[02:51:23.820 --> 02:51:25.820]  Or a new hearth to be lit
[02:51:25.820 --> 02:51:27.820]  Meaning a new sunrise
[02:51:27.820 --> 02:51:29.820]  Now, it's funny, he says this
[02:51:29.820 --> 02:51:31.820]  On the University of Texas website
[02:51:31.820 --> 02:51:33.820]  Because I've been down to the archaeological sites
[02:51:33.820 --> 02:51:35.820]  I've gone to local museums
[02:51:35.820 --> 02:51:37.820]  I've sat there with Mayan archaeologists
[02:51:37.820 --> 02:51:39.820]  Who are Mayan and they've told me
[02:51:39.820 --> 02:51:41.820]  No, none of this is true
[02:51:41.820 --> 02:51:43.820]  It's made up by people in the 60s in the U.S.
[02:51:43.820 --> 02:51:45.820]  All it means is a new hearth
[02:51:45.820 --> 02:51:47.820]  So, even if you believe
[02:51:47.820 --> 02:51:49.820]  That it's going to be the end of the world
[02:51:51.820 --> 02:51:53.820]  You have to
[02:51:53.820 --> 02:51:55.820]  Understand that the Mayans
[02:51:55.820 --> 02:51:57.820]  Never said that and never meant that
[02:51:57.820 --> 02:51:59.820]  And the mainstream media hyping
[02:51:59.820 --> 02:52:01.820]  And pushing all of this
[02:52:05.820 --> 02:52:07.820]  They
[02:52:07.820 --> 02:52:09.820]  Know
[02:52:09.820 --> 02:52:11.820]  That it's all about just giving people
[02:52:11.820 --> 02:52:13.820]  Something to cop out about
[02:52:13.820 --> 02:52:15.820]  So that, oh, I'm not going to get involved
[02:52:15.820 --> 02:52:17.820]  It's the end of the world anyways
[02:52:17.820 --> 02:52:19.820]  And the people promoting all of this
[02:52:19.820 --> 02:52:21.820]  I'm just not doing this justice here
[02:52:21.820 --> 02:52:23.820]  Because I know I'm running out of time
[02:52:23.820 --> 02:52:25.820]  Then I try to hurry up and then I don't get to it all
[02:52:25.820 --> 02:52:27.820]  Paul Watson's article
[02:52:27.820 --> 02:52:29.820]  Is up at infowars.com
[02:52:29.820 --> 02:52:31.820]  And prismplanet.com
[02:52:31.820 --> 02:52:33.820]  But the point is
[02:52:33.820 --> 02:52:35.820]  The people say it's Planet X
[02:52:35.820 --> 02:52:37.820]  The people say it's Nibiru going to hit us
[02:52:37.820 --> 02:52:39.820]  They say it's a comet, a meteor shower, a galactic plane
[02:52:39.820 --> 02:52:41.820]  A pole shift
[02:52:41.820 --> 02:52:43.820]  And it's all pure bull
[02:52:43.820 --> 02:52:45.820]  But here's the big message
[02:52:45.820 --> 02:52:47.820]  There could be a pole shift
[02:52:47.820 --> 02:52:49.820]  There could be a giant asteroid hit us
[02:52:49.820 --> 02:52:51.820]  A tectonic event
[02:52:51.820 --> 02:52:53.820]  The sun could send out a super flare
[02:52:53.820 --> 02:52:55.820]  And hit the earth and
[02:52:55.820 --> 02:52:57.820]  Burn one side of it to a crisp
[02:52:57.820 --> 02:52:59.820]  And it would take hundreds of millions of years
[02:52:59.820 --> 02:53:01.820]  To come back, if ever
[02:53:01.820 --> 02:53:03.820]  All of this is real threats
[02:53:03.820 --> 02:53:05.820]  But we can never address the real threats
[02:53:05.820 --> 02:53:07.820]  Of X-ray lasers
[02:53:07.820 --> 02:53:09.820]  And particle beams and the Hadron Superconducting
[02:53:09.820 --> 02:53:11.820]  Supercollider
[02:53:11.820 --> 02:53:13.820]  We can never address
[02:53:13.820 --> 02:53:15.820]  Any of this type stuff
[02:53:15.820 --> 02:53:17.820]  Because
[02:53:17.820 --> 02:53:19.820]  It's not always so busy hearing it's the rapture
[02:53:19.820 --> 02:53:21.820]  Or
[02:53:21.820 --> 02:53:23.820]  It's the end of the world, Mayan calendar
[02:53:23.820 --> 02:53:25.820]  And it's all pure bull
[02:53:25.820 --> 02:53:27.820]  And that's what I had to say
[02:53:27.820 --> 02:53:29.820]  On that subject and I'll get more into it
[02:53:29.820 --> 02:53:31.820]  After I take some of your calls
[02:53:31.820 --> 02:53:33.820]  And then I'll read over some of the real threats
[02:53:33.820 --> 02:53:35.820]  Our article gets into real threats
[02:53:35.820 --> 02:53:37.820]  To
[02:53:37.820 --> 02:53:39.820]  Humanity
[02:53:39.820 --> 02:53:41.820]  On the subject of my thought process
[02:53:41.820 --> 02:53:43.820]  Of why the guy called up and said
[02:53:43.820 --> 02:53:45.820]  Why aren't you doing that gun show anymore
[02:53:45.820 --> 02:53:47.820]  In two episodes, very popular
[02:53:47.820 --> 02:53:49.820]  Very successful
[02:53:49.820 --> 02:53:51.820]  Already had people calling up
[02:53:51.820 --> 02:53:53.820]  Wanting to give us national gun shows
[02:53:53.820 --> 02:53:55.820]  Right out of the gates
[02:53:55.820 --> 02:53:57.820]  As I knew what happened
[02:53:57.820 --> 02:53:59.820]  That's a question if we would even do that
[02:53:59.820 --> 02:54:01.820]  And
[02:54:01.820 --> 02:54:03.820]  You have all that stuff going on
[02:54:03.820 --> 02:54:05.820]  And I'm like yeah but
[02:54:05.820 --> 02:54:07.820]  A gun show would just make money
[02:54:07.820 --> 02:54:09.820]  And I don't want to just make money
[02:54:09.820 --> 02:54:11.820]  But then the argument is well if you make a bunch of money
[02:54:11.820 --> 02:54:13.820]  Then you can spend it on other projects
[02:54:13.820 --> 02:54:15.820]  And it's just that I enjoy
[02:54:15.820 --> 02:54:17.820]  Fighting the globalist
[02:54:17.820 --> 02:54:19.820]  And covering things more than I do
[02:54:19.820 --> 02:54:21.820]  Just making money
[02:54:21.820 --> 02:54:23.820]  But then there's the issue of
[02:54:23.820 --> 02:54:25.820]  Then I got to spend all day promoting other things to make money
[02:54:25.820 --> 02:54:27.820]  So I need to make as much money as I can
[02:54:27.820 --> 02:54:29.820]  To really get in the face of the globalist
[02:54:29.820 --> 02:54:31.820]  So maybe that's the answer
[02:54:31.820 --> 02:54:33.820]  But then to do that you've got to put on airs
[02:54:33.820 --> 02:54:35.820]  You've got to act arrogant
[02:54:35.820 --> 02:54:37.820]  You've got to act powerful in front of people
[02:54:37.820 --> 02:54:39.820]  I mean so much of this
[02:54:39.820 --> 02:54:41.820]  Is like ugabuga tribal stuff
[02:54:41.820 --> 02:54:43.820]  As a police and you've got to
[02:54:43.820 --> 02:54:45.820]  Get off the private jet
[02:54:45.820 --> 02:54:47.820]  You've got to court Hollywood people
[02:54:47.820 --> 02:54:49.820]  Which I can certainly do
[02:54:49.820 --> 02:54:51.820]  And get them to come out for you
[02:54:51.820 --> 02:54:53.820]  And you've got to play ball
[02:54:53.820 --> 02:54:55.820]  Well I don't want to just play ball
[02:54:55.820 --> 02:54:57.820]  So I can be
[02:54:57.820 --> 02:54:59.820]  Get out there because that will distort my message
[02:55:01.820 --> 02:55:03.820]  But yes you know maybe I should
[02:55:03.820 --> 02:55:05.820]  Do the book deals
[02:55:05.820 --> 02:55:07.820]  Maybe I should
[02:55:07.820 --> 02:55:09.820]  See the one thing I did decide to do
[02:55:09.820 --> 02:55:11.820]  And I'll tell you about it on Friday
[02:55:11.820 --> 02:55:13.820]  The one thing I did decide to do
[02:55:13.820 --> 02:55:15.820]  Is get a bunch of filmmakers together
[02:55:15.820 --> 02:55:17.820]  Because I make great documentaries
[02:55:17.820 --> 02:55:19.820]  That have been very successful
[02:55:19.820 --> 02:55:21.820]  But I just don't have time running everything
[02:55:21.820 --> 02:55:23.820]  And doing radio and news to do it
[02:55:23.820 --> 02:55:25.820]  And getting filmmakers together
[02:55:25.820 --> 02:55:27.820]  Because I know and have the sources in Hollywood
[02:55:27.820 --> 02:55:29.820]  In spades
[02:55:29.820 --> 02:55:31.820]  To actually get films into theaters
[02:55:31.820 --> 02:55:33.820]  In a test, have them sell out
[02:55:33.820 --> 02:55:35.820]  Then they go to more screens
[02:55:35.820 --> 02:55:37.820]  See what happened is when I watched
[02:55:37.820 --> 02:55:39.820]  Mrs. Sousa do that
[02:55:39.820 --> 02:55:41.820]  And make 20 million dollars off a film
[02:55:41.820 --> 02:55:43.820]  That I could do better than
[02:55:43.820 --> 02:55:45.820]  It was still well done
[02:55:45.820 --> 02:55:47.820]  I don't agree with the premise
[02:55:47.820 --> 02:55:49.820]  That Obama is a globalist, not an anti-colonialist
[02:55:49.820 --> 02:55:51.820]  He's an anti-traditional colonialist
[02:55:51.820 --> 02:55:53.820]  And then he wants global banker
[02:55:53.820 --> 02:55:55.820]  Balkanization, like you balkanize the countries
[02:55:55.820 --> 02:55:57.820]  And play them off against each other
[02:55:57.820 --> 02:55:59.820]  They have an overall overreaching globalism above it
[02:55:59.820 --> 02:56:01.820]  I said
[02:56:01.820 --> 02:56:03.820]  Well okay we need to come out
[02:56:03.820 --> 02:56:05.820]  And actually find the filmmakers
[02:56:05.820 --> 02:56:07.820]  And put them on the circuit
[02:56:07.820 --> 02:56:09.820]  And pay them money
[02:56:09.820 --> 02:56:11.820]  Up front
[02:56:11.820 --> 02:56:13.820]  To get them in the right theaters
[02:56:13.820 --> 02:56:15.820]  And get them promoted
[02:56:15.820 --> 02:56:17.820]  I mean I could take films with $500,000
[02:56:17.820 --> 02:56:19.820]  Budgets and put another $500,000
[02:56:19.820 --> 02:56:21.820]  On promotion
[02:56:21.820 --> 02:56:23.820]  Guaranteed even if they were quote failures
[02:56:23.820 --> 02:56:25.820]  They'd make $5 million
[02:56:25.820 --> 02:56:27.820]  And so I was already planning to launch
[02:56:27.820 --> 02:56:29.820]  All this and I'm sure Beck went and
[02:56:29.820 --> 02:56:31.820]  Also you know smart guy
[02:56:31.820 --> 02:56:33.820]  Saw all that and is going with that
[02:56:33.820 --> 02:56:35.820]  My model's better
[02:56:35.820 --> 02:56:37.820]  My model's much better and much quicker
[02:56:37.820 --> 02:56:39.820]  So there'll be a race now
[02:56:39.820 --> 02:56:41.820]  To see who can get these films out the fastest
[02:56:41.820 --> 02:56:43.820]  And the best
[02:56:43.820 --> 02:56:45.820]  So that's it
[02:56:45.820 --> 02:56:47.820]  That's what's going on and you know
[02:56:47.820 --> 02:56:49.820]  With Beck you'll get a Dinesh D'Souza
[02:56:49.820 --> 02:56:51.820]  The Republicans are going to save us
[02:56:51.820 --> 02:56:53.820]  Obama's a communist from Kenya
[02:56:53.820 --> 02:56:55.820]  Or a guy originally from Kenya
[02:56:55.820 --> 02:56:57.820]  Born here but roots in Kenya
[02:56:57.820 --> 02:56:59.820]  Who just doesn't like capitalism and freedom
[02:56:59.820 --> 02:57:01.820]  No he's a mega bank front guy
[02:57:01.820 --> 02:57:03.820]  All their competition and carry out eugenics
[02:57:03.820 --> 02:57:05.820]  In the third world
[02:57:05.820 --> 02:57:07.820]  Posing as an anti-colonialist to sell
[02:57:07.820 --> 02:57:09.820]  And fool people
[02:57:09.820 --> 02:57:11.820]  And saying they're behind the Arab Spring
[02:57:11.820 --> 02:57:13.820]  To liberate people when it's to put radicals in
[02:57:13.820 --> 02:57:15.820]  So I kind of got off into that whole thought process
[02:57:15.820 --> 02:57:17.820]  But on Friday we will make the announcement
[02:57:17.820 --> 02:57:19.820]  We will make the announcement
[02:57:19.820 --> 02:57:21.820]  The one reason I procrastinated is
[02:57:21.820 --> 02:57:23.820]  You start getting into millions of dollars
[02:57:23.820 --> 02:57:25.820]  I got to go to the lawyers and I got to have
[02:57:25.820 --> 02:57:27.820]  Because we've paid out on every contest
[02:57:27.820 --> 02:57:29.820]  We've had like 20 of them or more
[02:57:29.820 --> 02:57:31.820]  Report films and promos and activism
[02:57:31.820 --> 02:57:33.820]  But when I do this
[02:57:33.820 --> 02:57:35.820]  You know this is a
[02:57:35.820 --> 02:57:37.820]  Again I've been talking about it for about 3-4 months
[02:57:37.820 --> 02:57:39.820]  And
[02:57:39.820 --> 02:57:41.820]  It's the way to go
[02:57:41.820 --> 02:57:43.820]  Because if something will make a ton of money
[02:57:43.820 --> 02:57:45.820]  Which I can put back into the fight
[02:57:45.820 --> 02:57:47.820]  And reach millions, now that's where I'm at
[02:57:47.820 --> 02:57:49.820]  See a book
[02:57:49.820 --> 02:57:51.820]  That gets read by a million people
[02:57:51.820 --> 02:57:53.820]  That's about as big as they get
[02:57:53.820 --> 02:57:55.820]  In non-fiction
[02:57:55.820 --> 02:57:57.820]  That makes you 5 million dollars
[02:57:57.820 --> 02:57:59.820]  What am I
[02:57:59.820 --> 02:58:01.820]  I don't care about the 5 million dollars
[02:58:01.820 --> 02:58:03.820]  I care about a million people
[02:58:03.820 --> 02:58:05.820]  Well if I can put out a 10 minute video
[02:58:05.820 --> 02:58:07.820]  Take the one with my son
[02:58:07.820 --> 02:58:09.820]  The secret terrorists don't want you to know
[02:58:09.820 --> 02:58:11.820]  Just google that I'm going to have it posted back on the front page
[02:58:11.820 --> 02:58:13.820]  Of m4wars.com
[02:58:13.820 --> 02:58:15.820]  That will probably end up getting seen by 500,000 people
[02:58:15.820 --> 02:58:17.820]  A year from now
[02:58:17.820 --> 02:58:19.820]  Probably it will be a million
[02:58:19.820 --> 02:58:21.820]  See it makes me no money
[02:58:21.820 --> 02:58:23.820]  But it reaches a million people
[02:58:23.820 --> 02:58:25.820]  Put me in that briar patch all day
[02:58:25.820 --> 02:58:27.820]  I don't want hearts and minds
[02:58:27.820 --> 02:58:29.820]  I want to defeat the globalist
[02:58:29.820 --> 02:58:31.820]  I'm happy in my 4 bedroom house
[02:58:31.820 --> 02:58:33.820]  I don't want a 20 bedroom house
[02:58:33.820 --> 02:58:35.820]  Or a helicopter
[02:58:35.820 --> 02:58:37.820]  You understand the difference
[02:58:37.820 --> 02:58:57.820]  If you want an American company with American products made by Americans
[02:58:57.820 --> 02:59:00.820]  Here is the Calben Soap Company
[02:59:00.820 --> 02:59:04.820]  Alex and his staff have used these pure soap products for years
[02:59:04.820 --> 02:59:09.820]  These all natural soaps are made from the highest quality vegetable and coconut oils
[02:59:09.820 --> 02:59:11.820]  That are earth friendly and safe
[02:59:11.820 --> 02:59:14.820]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com

[02:59:19.820 --> 02:59:22.820]  Buy the one to two month sample package
[02:59:22.820 --> 02:59:25.820]  And enjoy soaps that are twice as good as what you're using now
[02:59:25.820 --> 02:59:29.820]  Or save big with a one to two year supply of soaps
[02:59:29.820 --> 02:59:31.820]  For all your cleaning needs
[02:59:31.820 --> 02:59:33.820]  This is an amazing deal
[02:59:33.820 --> 02:59:35.820]  You can save thousands of dollars
[02:59:35.820 --> 02:59:38.820]  And you will love the way real soap makes you feel
[02:59:38.820 --> 02:59:41.820]  See them on the web at 5starsoap.com
[02:59:41.820 --> 03:00:03.820]  Or call 800-340-7091 for a free catalog
[03:00:12.820 --> 03:00:16.820]  What I'm going to do is I'm going to shoot a video
[03:00:16.820 --> 03:00:22.820]  On the Watson article that we put together
[03:00:22.820 --> 03:00:25.820]  Dealing with 2012 not being the end of the world
[03:00:25.820 --> 03:00:29.820]  And then I will play that on the show in the next few days
[03:00:29.820 --> 03:00:32.820]  We're also going to premiere
[03:00:32.820 --> 03:00:34.820]  Probably tonight if not on the radio tomorrow
[03:00:34.820 --> 03:00:36.820]  The video and audio of my confrontation
[03:00:36.820 --> 03:00:38.820]  Down at the federal building last week
[03:00:38.820 --> 03:00:40.820]  We just had so much on our plate
[03:00:40.820 --> 03:00:42.820]  More video editors, more researchers
[03:00:42.820 --> 03:00:43.820]  Then we got to train them
[03:00:43.820 --> 03:00:45.820]  Because I'm just trying to throw everything at the globalist right now
[03:00:45.820 --> 03:00:47.820]  Because everything we do is hitting the zeitgeist
[03:00:47.820 --> 03:00:50.820]  But we just need to absolutely maximize as much damage
[03:00:50.820 --> 03:00:52.820]  To the globalist as we can
[03:00:52.820 --> 03:00:54.820]  And that's by waking people up
[03:00:54.820 --> 03:00:56.820]  Andrew in Oregon, thanks for putting up with me
[03:00:56.820 --> 03:00:58.820]  You're on the air, go ahead
[03:00:58.820 --> 03:01:02.820]  Hey buddy, you got your music turned up in the background
[03:01:02.820 --> 03:01:04.820]  You're listing on the internet, you must be
[03:01:06.820 --> 03:01:08.820]  We'll put him on hold or get rid of him
[03:01:08.820 --> 03:01:10.820]  I'm sorry, Hollywood and propaganda
[03:01:10.820 --> 03:01:13.820]  Josh and Indiana, that's like saying a bear
[03:01:13.820 --> 03:01:15.820]  Does bad things in the woods with its wool
[03:01:15.820 --> 03:01:16.820]  Go ahead
[03:01:16.820 --> 03:01:19.820]  Hey brother, how are you doing?
[03:01:19.820 --> 03:01:22.820]  I had a quick news item from 1919
[03:01:22.820 --> 03:01:25.820]  That I wanted to run by and get your analysis if I could
[03:01:25.820 --> 03:01:27.820]  That sounds pretty evil, go ahead
[03:01:27.820 --> 03:01:30.820]  Headline, plan to fight reds with motion pictures
[03:01:30.820 --> 03:01:32.820]  December 17th, 1919
[03:01:32.820 --> 03:01:35.820]  Nationwide campaign to combat the spread of Bolshevism
[03:01:35.820 --> 03:01:38.820]  And alter radical tendencies was initiated after meetings
[03:01:38.820 --> 03:01:41.820]  Between administration officials, members of Congress
[03:01:41.820 --> 03:01:43.820]  And motion picture executives
[03:01:43.820 --> 03:01:45.820]  They passed a resolution that the American motion picture
[03:01:45.820 --> 03:01:48.820]  Industry do all that is within its power
[03:01:48.820 --> 03:01:51.820]  To up build and strengthen the spirit of Americanism
[03:01:51.820 --> 03:01:53.820]  Within our people
[03:01:53.820 --> 03:01:55.820]  The prime mover in the new campaign is Secretary of the Interior
[03:01:55.820 --> 03:01:59.820]  Franklin K. Lane, who expressed to the movie mobiles
[03:01:59.820 --> 03:02:02.820]  Two views about the seriousness of present social situation
[03:02:02.820 --> 03:02:03.820]  In this country
[03:02:03.820 --> 03:02:05.820]  No, that's right, again the megabanks
[03:02:05.820 --> 03:02:10.820]  And this is on record, funded linen in 1917-1918 takeover
[03:02:10.820 --> 03:02:13.820]  Then used that threat to take over the media
[03:02:13.820 --> 03:02:15.820]  In the name of countering the threat
[03:02:15.820 --> 03:02:16.820]  Do you understand how that works?
[03:02:16.820 --> 03:02:20.820]  Just like Emperor Palpatine as a senator attacks his own planet
[03:02:20.820 --> 03:02:22.820]  To get more power to become chancellor
[03:02:22.820 --> 03:02:25.820]  Then he attacks the capital planet to become emperor
[03:02:25.820 --> 03:02:27.820]  To meet the threat he's engineered
[03:02:27.820 --> 03:02:30.820]  Again, a children's movie explaining how this really works
[03:02:30.820 --> 03:02:31.820]  Yes
[03:02:31.820 --> 03:02:33.820]  Absolutely, sir, bread and circus
[03:02:33.820 --> 03:02:34.820]  Bread and circus
[03:02:34.820 --> 03:02:38.820]  I mean, Hollywood has been a government run since it started
[03:02:38.820 --> 03:02:41.820]  And that is when it was started, it was in 1919
[03:02:41.820 --> 03:02:43.820]  You've actually done your homework, my friend
[03:02:43.820 --> 03:02:45.820]  What is that out of? The New York Times?
[03:02:45.820 --> 03:02:47.820]  You know, I got this out of a book
[03:02:47.820 --> 03:02:49.820]  My mom used to make books at a binary
[03:02:49.820 --> 03:02:52.820]  And it's called Chronicle of the 20th Century
[03:02:52.820 --> 03:02:56.820]  And it was the best book in 1987
[03:02:56.820 --> 03:02:59.820]  And it's just a chronological order of just major news headlines
[03:02:59.820 --> 03:03:01.820]  And if you're a lyricist and you've got eyes and feet
[03:03:01.820 --> 03:03:05.820]  Man, it just reconnects the dots all the way up to 87
[03:03:05.820 --> 03:03:06.820]  And it's really something
[03:03:06.820 --> 03:03:07.820]  I mean, it's got Ralph Trout in here
[03:03:07.820 --> 03:03:09.820]  Rocklefeller, all his dirty deeds
[03:03:09.820 --> 03:03:11.820]  Like, the next page owner says
[03:03:11.820 --> 03:03:14.820]  Rocklefeller beats home record and forgiving
[03:03:14.820 --> 03:03:15.820]  This was the same day
[03:03:15.820 --> 03:03:16.820]  Oh, no, listen, listen, listen, listen, listen
[03:03:16.820 --> 03:03:17.820]  I'm going to tell you this
[03:03:17.820 --> 03:03:18.820]  I appreciate your call
[03:03:18.820 --> 03:03:20.820]  We were over at my grandmother's house Saturday
[03:03:20.820 --> 03:03:21.820]  Went to see her
[03:03:21.820 --> 03:03:24.820]  And the kids were over there and we brought her Chinese food
[03:03:24.820 --> 03:03:25.820]  And we're sitting there
[03:03:25.820 --> 03:03:27.820]  And I knock on the door
[03:03:27.820 --> 03:03:29.820]  And it's the Nature Conservancy
[03:03:29.820 --> 03:03:31.820]  Total CIA Rocklefeller created
[03:03:31.820 --> 03:03:33.820]  I tell the woman that, close the door
[03:03:33.820 --> 03:03:35.820]  My wife opens National Geographic
[03:03:35.820 --> 03:03:37.820]  It's the human genome global track
[03:03:37.820 --> 03:03:39.820]  That's really to get the racial lines
[03:03:39.820 --> 03:03:41.820]  So they can use bio weapons to take out certain races
[03:03:41.820 --> 03:03:43.820]  Because they're worried that everybody's in her bread
[03:03:43.820 --> 03:03:45.820]  That's a globalist Rocklefeller funded thing
[03:03:45.820 --> 03:03:47.820]  And then we open another magazine
[03:03:47.820 --> 03:03:48.820]  It's a Rocklefeller funded deal
[03:03:48.820 --> 03:03:52.820]  They created over 50 organizations to set up world government
[03:03:52.820 --> 03:03:53.820]  They set up the UN
[03:03:53.820 --> 03:03:55.820]  And they're just Rothschild fronts
[03:03:55.820 --> 03:03:56.820]  Great point
[03:03:56.820 --> 03:03:57.820]  It's just they're everywhere
[03:03:57.820 --> 03:03:58.820]  They're attacking us
[03:03:58.820 --> 03:04:00.820]  They've created all this
[03:04:00.820 --> 03:04:02.820]  I want to hear from Gary in New York
[03:04:02.820 --> 03:04:04.820]  CNBC report on Obama
[03:04:04.820 --> 03:04:05.820]  What'd they say?
[03:04:05.820 --> 03:04:06.820]  That he's our Lord and Savior?
[03:04:06.820 --> 03:04:07.820]  We're almost out of time
[03:04:07.820 --> 03:04:09.820]  I don't think humane way
[03:04:09.820 --> 03:04:13.820]  In a way that doesn't destroy the environment, public health
[03:04:13.820 --> 03:04:17.820]  I think Gary's playing a clip off the news
[03:04:17.820 --> 03:04:18.820]  We're out of time
[03:04:18.820 --> 03:04:19.820]  I'm obnoxious with these calls
[03:04:19.820 --> 03:04:21.820]  I get so wound up, folks
[03:04:21.820 --> 03:04:23.820]  I just get up here in its free flow of information
[03:04:23.820 --> 03:04:24.820]  I'm out of time
[03:04:24.820 --> 03:04:26.820]  If those callers call back tomorrow
[03:04:26.820 --> 03:04:27.820]  I'll try to get to them
[03:04:27.820 --> 03:04:28.820]  I've just got to break my...
[03:04:28.820 --> 03:04:29.820]  I'm totally neurotic
[03:04:29.820 --> 03:04:31.820]  I just cannot get to a bunch of calls
[03:04:31.820 --> 03:04:33.820]  Because I do get to a caller
[03:04:33.820 --> 03:04:34.820]  Then if you do get to me
[03:04:34.820 --> 03:04:38.820]  Get ready for an hour of just verbal fire hosing
[03:04:38.820 --> 03:04:40.820]  Because it's like flipping a switch
[03:04:40.820 --> 03:04:43.820]  I'm going to try to regroup, refocus
[03:04:43.820 --> 03:04:45.820]  I've got a bunch of reports to shoot
[03:04:45.820 --> 03:04:46.820]  Big stuff tonight, 7 o'clock
