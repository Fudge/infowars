[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN
[00:16.000 --> 00:30.000]  radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones well Christmas 2014 came and went like the
[00:30.000 --> 00:38.000]  year itself as we enter the final moments of 2015 as time travels faster and faster it seems
[00:38.000 --> 00:44.000]  welcome ladies and gentlemen we're live broadcasting worldwide on this Friday the 26th day of December
[00:44.000 --> 00:52.800]  2014 I'm your host Alex Jones and we have Doug Hagman of the Northeast Intelligence Report joining
[00:52.800 --> 01:01.600]  us to cover a host of developing news stories but I do want to really go over a ton of news today
[01:01.600 --> 01:08.480]  obviously there's a stack of very informative to understand what's happening in the group mind
[01:08.480 --> 01:15.920]  out there a big stack of important news dealing with Christmas and we have things like snow capped
[01:15.920 --> 01:23.600]  summits give Hawaii a white Christmas a rare snowfall giving the mountains the volcanic
[01:23.600 --> 01:32.960]  mountains white caps like the Mont Blanc of Europe Google goes off the climate change deep end
[01:32.960 --> 01:38.000]  saying there is no question and we should submit to whatever government says
[01:41.280 --> 01:44.880]  I'm going to be breaking that report down because last night I went to a movie
[01:45.440 --> 01:50.960]  went and saw Fox catcher excellent film based on the true story of John DePont going crazy
[01:53.200 --> 01:56.800]  and when I'm walking out there are Google representatives there pushing
[01:56.800 --> 02:06.400]  free Google if you just pay to put it in one time and if you live downtown near their headquarters
[02:06.400 --> 02:13.200]  it's just free period do you really think they're trying to give you something free all of the smart
[02:13.200 --> 02:19.200]  televisions now that have come out have microphones and cameras in them and on record in their terms
[02:19.200 --> 02:29.760]  of service say one of the latest of course is the folks out of South Korea Samsung
[02:32.160 --> 02:36.160]  they say in their terms of service we are listening and watching you so watch what you say
[02:36.960 --> 02:38.960]  and we do send what you say to third parties
[02:41.200 --> 02:47.040]  and we broke that news four or five months ago and no one picked it up but I think DrudgeReport.com
[02:47.040 --> 02:52.640]  doesn't mean who cares you know we're linking directly to the terms of service it's admitted
[02:52.640 --> 02:58.320]  it's bombshell it's sensational it's cuckoo for cocoa puffs level
[03:00.400 --> 03:09.760]  and it just is oh xbox and and other systems were hacked and so there's no online gaming right now
[03:09.760 --> 03:15.600]  that's down oh no that's actually got people concerned all of this ahead of them reintroducing
[03:15.600 --> 03:23.680]  the cyber security act so pa and syspa internationally and nationally two versions of each gaming
[03:23.680 --> 03:28.080]  hack attack xbox live playstation network remain down apparent denial of service attack
[03:28.720 --> 03:32.960]  or is it another false flag like they're basically now admitting with the interview
[03:32.960 --> 03:38.960]  that gets a 50% rating at rotten tomatoes and similar to that on imdb and other places
[03:38.960 --> 03:46.400]  because i might have watched it even though i'm i'm not a huge fan about those actors i've
[03:46.400 --> 03:51.440]  seen some of the movies that are okay i like comedies especially around christmas time but i

[10:53.520 --> 10:58.560]  site itself it has that article though and don't try it pigs don't try to do anything nice we know
[10:58.560 --> 11:04.480]  you're all bad that's exactly what the globalist want is that if the police try to have community
[11:04.480 --> 11:09.760]  outreach programs and try to be involved in real local community policing and constitutional
[11:10.800 --> 11:14.320]  then the public's so mad at them already they just say no you just stay over there and be

[11:28.880 --> 11:35.280]  the interview well if north korea was really trying to censor it yes you should go see it but
[11:35.280 --> 11:44.480]  it was a sony stunt and that's basically been admitted now and so if you go see it you're
[11:44.480 --> 11:51.840]  being played as a chump now when the communist chinese uh wanted
[11:54.960 --> 11:58.400]  and were successful for a year to block the release
[11:58.400 --> 12:06.400]  of red dawn the remake and had it changed north korea that was the film i promoted went and saw
[12:06.400 --> 12:12.160]  even though it was not a very good film because it is about stopping censorship but this is obama
[12:12.160 --> 12:18.080]  and others and sony manipulating people's conscience critics hate the interview though
[12:18.080 --> 12:21.520]  movie critics say the controversy surrounding the interview is much more interesting the
[12:21.520 --> 12:26.960]  movie itself movie is scoring just 50 positive reviews from critics on rotten tomatoes website
[12:26.960 --> 12:33.920]  it's fairly even more poorly with top sites who gave it a measly 32 positive rating yeah it's
[12:33.920 --> 12:43.200]  a hard to get one that low it's down to 48 percent now as we speak again i'm just moving
[12:43.200 --> 12:48.160]  right to left right now across the desk here i have not even gotten into the hardcore news yet
[12:48.160 --> 12:57.760]  russia revises military doctrine lists nato buildup as a major threat russia considers nato
[12:57.760 --> 13:03.200]  number one threat is preparing for war that dub tells me this article already mentioned us military
[13:03.200 --> 13:10.000]  equipment being detoured for possible battle versus isis japan game over savings rate turns
[13:10.000 --> 13:15.280]  negative japanese economy begins to implode and that will take the rest of the world with it
[13:15.280 --> 13:22.960]  so you take down russia and you try to block their oil and gas sales and you destabilize russia and
[13:22.960 --> 13:29.280]  you plunge the ruble that will then start a chain reaction into europe more than anywhere else because
[13:29.280 --> 13:36.800]  they got about 60 percent of their overall energy from russia at low prices and then you add to that
[13:39.680 --> 13:44.320]  all the other destabilization going on around the world this could trigger the big economic
[13:44.320 --> 13:49.200]  collapse at least a new level of it that's why they just passed two weeks ago the new banker
[13:49.200 --> 13:55.520]  bailout legislation ahead of time and the new derivative legislation where you and i guarantee
[13:55.520 --> 14:04.560]  global derivatives by hundreds of shyster organizations but i get emails and again it's
[14:04.560 --> 14:10.240]  a minority of people going you traitor you ought to want to bring down russia and you ought to want
[14:10.240 --> 14:20.640]  war and it's just ridiculous our country is occupied by the globalists the la times now
[14:20.640 --> 14:24.720]  reporting that congress's back room pension cutting deal is even worse than expected
[14:26.240 --> 14:30.000]  yeah this has all been rammed through the last spending bill that the republicans went along
[14:30.000 --> 14:36.160]  with them they're not blocking obama on executive amnesty they're not blocking obama on executive
[14:36.160 --> 14:40.320]  gun grabbing they're not blocking obama on shutting down more power plants
[14:43.360 --> 14:48.480]  and the average yuppie will say i don't own a coal plant i don't own stock in one of those companies
[14:49.200 --> 14:53.520]  no you just get well you used to get half your power from now you get 37 percent you notice
[14:53.520 --> 14:58.880]  your power bills a lot higher okay chumps but you go well it's for the earth i'm glad that
[14:58.880 --> 15:07.600]  texas was supplying four states surrounding it from colorado oklahoma louisiana new mexico
[15:10.320 --> 15:17.280]  now texas can't supply her own power after six years of obama but don't worry more than 19 last
[15:17.280 --> 15:25.440]  time i checked new giant coal power dirty plants opened right on the texas border in mexico they shoot
[15:25.440 --> 15:31.840]  pure black smoke mercury out the top no scrubbers on them they're much smaller just a smoke stack in the
[15:32.400 --> 15:35.040]  and the big uh coal burners that turn the turbines
[15:37.040 --> 15:39.840]  that get generated from the boil water
[15:41.840 --> 15:45.920]  and they just belch it right out and it blows right in and blows on the mexicans
[15:45.920 --> 15:49.840]  and our totally clean plants are getting shut down and are allowed to open just just just thought
[15:49.840 --> 15:56.240]  i'd remind you because you know here's here's google i'm doing pretty good getting into the
[15:56.240 --> 15:59.840]  stack but google goes off the climate change deep end
[16:02.320 --> 16:07.040]  eric schmidt the head of google in a npr interview
[16:10.320 --> 16:15.120]  went on to say that it is that that that no one is debating and it's the same al gore quote
[16:15.120 --> 16:20.400]  100 all scientist agree and we should just accept everything town hall has a transcript
[16:22.960 --> 16:28.960]  remember this guy owns wide body full jets he flies around last time i checked in his own
[16:28.960 --> 16:36.800]  personal seven seven seven one of the other big google dons i was reading is buying one of those
[16:36.800 --> 16:46.400]  new giant air buses you know the ones that can hold like 300 people big huge bedrooms in them party
[16:46.400 --> 16:51.120]  suites everything there's only a few folks flying on when they fly and that's great if you didn't get
[16:51.120 --> 16:55.760]  your money from inside deals and if you didn't want to tell africans they can't have a car or
[16:55.760 --> 17:01.840]  can't have air conditioning and you're telling us we can't have anything just like al gore says when
[17:01.840 --> 17:07.440]  he makes money off the carbon taxes google is heavily invested in the different carbon trading
[17:07.440 --> 17:16.560]  schemes and it's a pure cold-blooded scam to selectively tax energy for every major company
[17:16.560 --> 17:25.040]  and corporation individual but general electric google and others who pay zero taxes and if you
[17:25.040 --> 17:32.880]  go back to five years ago obama signed an executive order exempting general electric from the carbon
[17:34.320 --> 17:40.320]  orders he put out that shut down the power plants look it up that guy's just typing into the to the
[17:40.320 --> 17:48.480]  nsa the public arm of it google just type in general electric gets power plant waiver from obama
[17:48.480 --> 17:54.480]  and i have this pet peeve i mean i talk about power plants at least once a week because
[17:55.680 --> 18:03.040]  it's such a perfect example of how my grandfather never talked about it after he died we dug through
[18:03.040 --> 18:08.640]  his letters and manuals and commendations and his army air core manual they had like a class
[18:08.640 --> 18:14.960]  manual graduating and in there were some of the letters of things they did like bombing german
[18:14.960 --> 18:20.960]  power plants well see that's what an enemy does they blow up your power plants well the globalists
[18:20.960 --> 18:27.520]  just turn the power plants off but leave their power plants on and then rake you over the coals
[18:27.520 --> 18:33.760]  it's such a sick joke 180 plus countries only about 15 of them are trying to put the carbon
[18:33.760 --> 18:40.960]  taxes in australia some european countries the uk the us bachari who was the head of the un climate
[18:40.960 --> 18:47.840]  body turned out he lobbied to get a bunch of steel plants shut down and coal plants in england and
[18:47.840 --> 18:55.520]  turned out he owns them in india and actually had those very plants uh engineers and and ownership
[18:55.520 --> 19:02.400]  in the same companies move to india that's all it is is your company shut down mine's allowed
[19:02.400 --> 19:11.360]  to operate that's all it is cold-blooded gangster thugism 110 laughing at you and your family while
[19:11.360 --> 19:20.480]  schmidt flies around on a 777 loaded with the beauty queens of the world and hey i'm a libertarian

[24:17.760 --> 24:24.880]  rob dude a little piece a christmas new year's message from the private run for profit fellow
[24:24.880 --> 24:31.760]  reserve we're going to be airing and we premiered this last year it's a wonderful lie and no matter
[24:31.760 --> 24:36.160]  where we put on the internet it got pulled and censored because it's based on it's a wonderful
[24:36.160 --> 24:45.120]  life totally covered by fair use totally covered by commentary 110 but they're really scared of

[25:04.160 --> 25:10.240]  because they don't let you post it on youtube or anywhere else they pull it down within minutes
[25:10.240 --> 25:17.680]  and the federal reserve has propagandists in every major city on record trying to fight
[25:17.680 --> 25:24.400]  the public discovering that this is a foreign occupational government corporate government
[25:24.400 --> 25:30.960]  in control this used our country to take control of the planet so that is coming up and who works
[25:30.960 --> 25:40.240]  for them well back in 1913 on December 23rd now 101 years ago and three days remember last year
[25:42.240 --> 25:48.000]  last December 23rd 2013 marked the 100th anniversary of the private fellow reserve
[25:49.920 --> 25:56.000]  well we are now into the 100 and first year now being over
[25:56.000 --> 26:10.160]  we're now 101 years into this monstrosity and that same day they claimed that all whatever
[26:10.160 --> 26:14.880]  amount of states it was at the time i've there's books on it the law that never was and others
[26:14.880 --> 26:19.840]  have constitutional lawyers on it there weren't 50 states at the time they claimed a majority
[26:19.840 --> 26:24.480]  had ratified it and simple research of the state records show that almost all the states
[26:24.480 --> 26:29.760]  did not ratify it or never even voted on it but they got up and announced that it was now the law
[26:32.960 --> 26:39.200]  the income tax almost every time that ron paul when he was a congressman would be on cnn or
[26:39.200 --> 26:43.680]  fox news they would say you want to get rid of the irs how will we run the country and he would
[26:43.680 --> 26:49.360]  usually be in the capital or with the capital in the background i saw him do this at least 10 times
[26:49.360 --> 26:55.840]  over the years and he would say this capital got built before we had an income tax this country
[26:55.840 --> 27:02.960]  had a 10 growth rate on average before 1913 the income tax wasn't implemented widespread until
[27:02.960 --> 27:13.920]  the 40s as a war tax then it was like half your income if you were middle class something like
[27:13.920 --> 27:20.640]  30 for the poor so kennedy talked to economists because they kept it from the world war two on
[27:22.400 --> 27:25.360]  and he repealed the wartime tax made him very popular
[27:28.000 --> 27:33.760]  and so when you hear he cut taxes by 50 that's because some tax brackets were above 50
[27:35.200 --> 27:39.680]  and he cut it down to almost nothing that sounds so radical today that a democrat would do something
[27:39.680 --> 27:47.120]  like that it's because the democratic party today does not resemble a democratic party
[27:47.680 --> 27:55.760]  in any shape or form of 1961 government knows that when you massively cut taxes you increase
[27:55.760 --> 28:03.280]  tax revenues and you know why that is a lot of states have like a week where they won't have
[28:03.280 --> 28:07.040]  sales tax they'll cut it in half and then revenues sometimes will double or triple
[28:07.040 --> 28:13.760]  it's because people then shop more when they have more discretionary income that stirs confidence
[28:13.760 --> 28:19.200]  and more spending more productivity but the globalists want a post-industrial world where
[28:19.200 --> 28:25.840]  google executives have you know 1015 houses a piece four or five wives 10 15 20 30 mestresses
[28:25.840 --> 28:29.920]  on record and when i say on record you look up news articles where some of these google guys
[28:29.920 --> 28:35.760]  i'm on today have like 30 girlfriends that get on the airplane with them oh there's schmidt
[28:35.760 --> 28:40.960]  getting on the airplane with like 30 women and he he and others have them wear bags over their heads
[28:40.960 --> 28:48.640]  like michael jackson veils so people can't see what porn star they're loading on he wants privacy
[28:48.640 --> 28:56.080]  but you don't get it but what i'm getting at here is we are now 101 years under the private
[28:56.080 --> 29:02.320]  mainly european bank owned federal reserve it's not federal that's just a fact think of the fraud of
[29:02.320 --> 29:11.760]  that and 101 years of the irs where general electric googled basically all of them are tax exempt they
[29:11.760 --> 29:18.160]  wrote the laws warren buffett but they're coming for you they're increasing audits of blue collar
[29:18.160 --> 29:23.520]  workers to search engine that they take them off the rich people and they put them on you
[29:23.520 --> 29:29.440]  or the middle class and now the irs is still penalizing christine o donnell the second time
[29:29.440 --> 29:36.800]  place levy on bank accounts the irs says it's a mistake they are intensifying their persecution
[29:36.800 --> 29:43.280]  this is a group of totalitarian criminal thugs who'd love to have a bolshevik style revolution

[40:06.320 --> 40:12.080]  first national bank in new york and the founder of the council on foreign relations met on an island
[40:12.640 --> 40:20.400]  on the coast of georgia for a quote hunting trip we would divide the country i mean banking system
[40:20.400 --> 40:26.240]  into 15 districts with one main office in washington dc we didn't want the government
[40:26.240 --> 40:31.520]  meddling in our affairs so we had a ceremonial pitchman position created and that person would
[40:31.520 --> 40:36.720]  be the focal point for all criticism and damnation when the people discovered that printing money
[40:36.720 --> 40:43.040]  out of thin air would cause inflation this person was known as the chairman and our little banking
[40:43.040 --> 40:50.320]  organization we called the federal reserve which is about as federal as federal express i love that
[40:50.320 --> 40:58.160]  one we ran this little plan through congress and the senate and just two days in late december
[40:58.160 --> 41:04.400]  and we had our little agent woodrow wilson sign it just two days before christmas ah
[41:04.400 --> 41:11.520]  the most wonderful time of year anyway flash forward 101 years and we have fully recovered
[41:11.520 --> 41:21.840]  from the recessions of 2008 2000 early 90s early 80s mid 70s late 60s early 60s the recessions
[41:21.840 --> 41:32.560]  of 58 53 49 45 38 37 and 33 which started back in 1929 the stock market has never been higher
[41:32.560 --> 41:38.080]  billionaires are buying all the new york city and i've never had so much money for my bags
[41:38.080 --> 41:43.760]  which is why i believe i was put here on this earth nevermind economic production
[41:43.760 --> 41:49.440]  unemployment reduced labor pool outsourcing of factories are money backed by something tangible
[41:50.000 --> 41:55.680]  as long as we have ones and zeros we can kick you and your children's future down the road until
[41:55.680 --> 42:02.960]  it's too late for your peons to stop us so merry christmas from the federal reserve celebrating 101
[42:02.960 --> 42:08.480]  years of economic disparity and financial ruin except for those of us who know the inside of
[42:08.480 --> 42:17.280]  the money to bags ratio quotient thank you shadow chairman of the fellow reserves
[42:18.960 --> 42:28.720]  very very nice now we're gonna play this highly censored video you notice that the people that
[42:28.720 --> 42:34.000]  own a wonderful life it's turn of broadcasting you notice they don't come out and say hey we're
[42:34.000 --> 42:38.960]  going to sue you can't air clips of our famous movie clearly fair use they just have it censored
[42:38.960 --> 42:46.560]  all over the internet when we play this video that parallels it's a wonderful life with the real
[42:46.560 --> 42:53.600]  world that's happening back then and again today and of course the wizard of oz and it's a wonderful
[42:53.600 --> 43:01.280]  life we're both films made about the banksters and about the manipulation of currency the first
[43:01.280 --> 43:08.480]  being the wizard of oz that was a play written about the silver and gold standard and then we're
[43:08.480 --> 43:14.560]  going to play a clip of alan greenspan on pbs saying the fellow reserve is above the law but
[43:14.560 --> 43:20.400]  first let's go to david night's excellent it's a wonderful lie be sure and record the audio in
[43:20.400 --> 43:25.440]  the video of this screen capture this if you're watching our live streams then full wars dot com
[43:25.440 --> 43:31.200]  four slash show because we've put up more than eight copies of this over the years and it's taken
[43:31.200 --> 43:40.080]  down in minutes they are scared of this here it is over the last 100 years the federal reserve has
[43:40.080 --> 43:45.280]  created bubbles and burst them enslaved us with debt and destroyed our purchasing power through
[43:45.280 --> 43:52.160]  inflation yes it's been a wonderful lie for the bankers there are striking parallels and frank
[43:52.160 --> 43:56.880]  cappers it's a wonderful life to the lies and tricks that real bankers used to create the
[43:56.880 --> 44:03.760]  federal reserve human nature doesn't change and the greedy elite of 1913 and 2013 look and act a
[44:03.760 --> 44:10.640]  lot like potter the banker in the movie and many americans are left like george bailey staring into
[44:10.640 --> 44:15.200]  the abyss as their dreams collapse and they face financial ruin do we live in a country that
[44:15.200 --> 44:20.400]  looks a lot more like pottersville than bedford falls what does frank cappers film show us about
[44:20.400 --> 44:25.200]  how we got here and how we can get out when the federal reserve was created two days before
[44:25.200 --> 44:31.520]  christmas a hundred years ago it was a culmination of six years of fraud fear and manipulation i've
[44:31.520 --> 44:37.680]  never really seen one but that's got all the air marks of being a run the panic of 1907 was used
[44:37.680 --> 44:42.400]  to shape public support for the fed the panic was triggered by rumors that two major banks were
[44:42.400 --> 44:48.080]  about to become insolvent just as we see in the movie george there is a room around town that you
[44:48.080 --> 44:56.240]  close your doors is that true i am going all out to help in this crisis i have just guaranteed
[44:56.240 --> 45:02.960]  the bank sufficient funds to meet their needs they will close up for a week and then reopen
[45:04.160 --> 45:11.360]  just took over the bank i may lose a fortune but i am willing to guarantee your people too
[45:11.360 --> 45:17.040]  just tell them to bring their shares over here and i will pay 50 cents on the dollar
[45:17.040 --> 45:22.400]  oh you never miss a trick do you potter unfortunately jp morgan got away with a deception
[45:22.400 --> 45:28.160]  and was able to shut down competitors and snapped up assets at fire cell prices take during the
[45:28.160 --> 45:34.240]  depression for instance you and i were the only ones that kept our heads you saved the building
[45:34.240 --> 45:41.040]  alone i saved all the rest yes well most people say you stole all the rest the envious ones
[45:41.040 --> 45:46.080]  say they're george the suckers charles lemberg senior warned people at the time of the creation
[45:46.080 --> 45:50.640]  of the federal reserve that it would not stop boom and bust cycles but would actually create them in
[45:50.640 --> 45:56.160]  order to benefit its private owners here's what he said to cause high prices all the federal reserve
[45:56.160 --> 46:01.600]  board will do will be to lower the re-discount rate producing an expansion of credit and a rising
[46:01.600 --> 46:06.080]  stock market then when businessmen are adjusted to these conditions it can check prosperity in
[46:06.080 --> 46:10.720]  mid-career by arbitrarily raising the rate of interest it can cause a pendulum of rising and
[46:10.720 --> 46:16.160]  falling market to swing gently back and forth or cause violent fluctuations by greater rate variation
[46:16.880 --> 46:21.440]  and in either case it will possess inside information as to the financial conditions
[46:21.440 --> 46:26.640]  and advanced knowledge of the coming change either up or down this is the strangest most
[46:26.640 --> 46:31.040]  dangerous advantage ever placed in the hands of a special privilege class by any government
[46:31.040 --> 46:36.560]  that ever existed the system is private conducted for the sole purpose of obtaining the greatest
[46:36.560 --> 46:41.200]  possible profits from the use of other people's money they know in advance when to create panics
[46:41.200 --> 46:47.360]  to their advantage and they know when to stop panic inflation and deflation work equally well for them
[46:47.360 --> 46:53.200]  when they control the finance as we see in the movie not all lending institutions have the same
[46:53.200 --> 47:00.720]  motivations now you take this one here the any bishop you know that fellow that sits around
[47:00.720 --> 47:08.240]  all day on his brain in his taxi you know i happen to know the bank turned down this loan but he
[47:08.240 --> 47:16.800]  comes here and we're building him a house worth five thousand dollars why well i handled that
[47:16.800 --> 47:22.000]  mr potter you have all the papers there is salary insurance i can personally vouch for his character
[47:22.000 --> 47:29.040]  friend of yours yes sir uh-huh you see if you shoot pool with some employee here you can come and
[47:29.040 --> 47:38.000]  borrow money what does that get us a discontented lazy rabble instead of a thrifty working class
[47:38.000 --> 47:43.040]  as a former fdic chair said all too often the large banks use their models and their algorithms
[47:43.040 --> 47:47.840]  and if you don't fit in their boxes you don't get the loan and dodd frank legislation is tying the
[47:47.840 --> 47:52.640]  hands of small lenders shutting out buyers and shutting down lenders today there are fewer lenders
[47:52.640 --> 47:59.520]  than at any time the government has kept records 10 000 banks disappeared between 1984 and 2011 this
[47:59.520 --> 48:04.400]  town needs this measly one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come
[48:04.400 --> 48:10.000]  without crawling to potter come on in the movie george gets to see what happens to the small
[48:10.000 --> 48:15.040]  town if potter didn't have competition from credit unions and smaller lenders if it hadn't been for
[48:15.040 --> 48:20.400]  you yeah it hadn't been for me everybody'd be a lot better off my wife and my kids and my friends
[48:20.400 --> 48:25.280]  are made look little fella why you go up and haunt somebody else yeah so you still think
[48:25.280 --> 48:31.680]  killing yourself would make everyone feel happier right i don't know i guess you're right
[48:34.000 --> 48:38.240]  it's supposed to have been better if i've never been born at all pottersville the only businesses
[48:38.240 --> 48:44.480]  thriving are vice people are angry the town is filled with signs like keep moving keep off the grass
[48:44.480 --> 48:49.760]  burt the cop actually shoots at george when he's running away and is no threat to anyone
[48:56.400 --> 49:01.360]  everyone is a renter no one has a stake now you're any bishop and you live in bailey park
[49:01.360 --> 49:06.000]  with your wife and kid look bud what's the idea i live in a shack in pottersville my wife ran away
[49:06.000 --> 49:10.400]  three years ago and took the kid and i never seen you before in my life see private property
[49:10.400 --> 49:15.760]  and everyone having a stake is the antidote to pottersville here you're all businessman here
[49:15.760 --> 49:19.440]  daughter doesn't make them better citizens doesn't make them better customers but whether it's the
[49:19.440 --> 49:25.520]  trans-pacific partnership or a global carbon tax the global elite don't see you as a stakeholder
[49:25.520 --> 49:30.880]  they want to turn us all into serfs and treat us like cattle just remember this mr potter that
[49:30.880 --> 49:35.520]  this rabble you're talking about they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in
[49:35.520 --> 49:39.520]  this community well is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die in a couple of
[49:39.520 --> 49:45.760]  decent rooms in a bath anyway my father didn't think so people were human beings to him but to
[49:45.760 --> 49:51.520]  you a warped frustrated old man their cattle well in my book he died a much richer man than you'll
[49:51.520 --> 49:57.200]  ever be i'm not interested in your book i'm talking about the building and loan i know very well
[49:57.200 --> 50:01.040]  what you're talking about you're talking about something you can't get your fingers on speaking
[50:01.040 --> 50:06.480]  of riches do you find the salary amounts amusing when potter tries to buy george off look at your
[50:06.480 --> 50:21.840]  side young man 27 28 married make me say 40 a week 45 45 45 george i'll start you out at 20
[50:21.840 --> 50:32.880]  thousand dollars a year 25 20 thousand dollars a year but you wouldn't mind living in the nicest
[50:32.880 --> 50:37.760]  house in town buying your wife a lot of fun that was like a million dollars a couple of business
[50:37.760 --> 50:43.840]  trips to new york a year maybe once in a while europe you wouldn't mind that would you don't would i
[50:44.560 --> 50:50.240]  even if george had saved a lot of his 20 000 salary would it have bought much a couple of decades
[50:50.240 --> 50:55.840]  later by even the government's very conservative estimate of inflation the dollar has lost 90
[50:55.840 --> 51:01.920]  percent of its value since 1947 when the movie was made the fed's deliberate inflation is devastating
[51:01.920 --> 51:07.360]  to anyone trying to accumulate wealth through hard work and saving so what is the answer to all the
[51:07.360 --> 51:11.680]  george bailey's out there a hundred years after the government gave control of our money supplied
[51:11.680 --> 51:17.280]  of private bankers like potter well potter had more money than he could spend but would any of
[51:17.280 --> 51:22.080]  you want to be potter you sit around here and you spin your little webs and you think the whole
[51:22.080 --> 51:27.520]  world revolves around you and your money well it doesn't mr potter in the in the whole vast
[51:27.520 --> 51:32.640]  configuration of things i'd say you were nothing but a scurvy little spider george bailey finally
[51:32.640 --> 51:38.400]  sees how rich his own life is as he sees the fruits of relationship honesty and compassion
[51:42.880 --> 51:49.840]  happy new year to you in jail going home they're waiting for you and if the public can awaken
[51:49.840 --> 51:55.520]  to the lies of the federal reserve if it could even be audited well hello mr bank examiner
[51:55.520 --> 52:01.440]  it would be a huge step to breaking the chains and enslave all of us but ultimately it is god
[52:01.440 --> 52:07.360]  that changed his minds and changed his hearts god hates oppression and we can and should
[52:07.360 --> 52:14.720]  confidently pray that he will stop it i owe everything to george bailey help him dear father
[52:15.520 --> 52:24.160]  joseph jesus and mary help my friend mr bailey help my son george tonight
[52:24.160 --> 52:29.680]  he never thinks about himself god that's why he's in trouble george is a good guy
[52:31.040 --> 52:38.880]  give him a break god i love him dear lord watch over him tonight please god something's
[52:38.880 --> 52:52.400]  the matter with daddy please be daddy bear dear father in heaven i'm not a praying man but if
[52:52.400 --> 53:09.680]  you're up there and you didn't hear me for the end for wars nightly news i'm david night a good
[53:09.680 --> 53:17.680]  wholesome nine-minute review under all fair use we're doing commentary we're analyzing we're doing a
[53:17.680 --> 53:26.000]  review it's a film that's been around for 80 years and they don't want you to see that review
[53:26.000 --> 53:33.440]  they are scared of the idea that people want an equal playing field to credit an equal playing
[53:33.440 --> 53:38.880]  field to have a lot of small businesses and that people back then knew that big powerful
[53:38.880 --> 53:46.800]  robber barons were trying to shut them down using government regulation i remember about
[53:46.800 --> 53:50.880]  four years ago when they passed a bunch of new quote bank regulations the head of the texas
[53:50.880 --> 53:55.040]  banking association wrote an article for the texas business journal was the awesome business
[53:55.040 --> 54:00.960]  journal i saw it several places saying these new regulations are meant to shut down competition
[54:01.600 --> 54:06.480]  and to absolutely wreck people over the coals and the article went into the private federal
[54:06.480 --> 54:14.800]  reserve so even the heads of of state banking boards know what's going on well of course they
[54:14.800 --> 54:20.400]  know what's going on but now they're speaking about it it's safe now 15 years ago if you talked
[54:20.400 --> 54:25.200]  about this they would send the adl and southern primary law center and you might have the fbi
[54:25.200 --> 54:33.280]  come to your house or come to your business we're here to do a emergency audit for fraud these are
[54:33.280 --> 54:39.520]  federal marshals from the treasury department they would come after you if you were in business and
[54:39.520 --> 54:46.960]  even talked about this guess what you lose new world order the house this year and two years ago
[54:46.960 --> 54:54.000]  passed the audit the senate barely defeated it that's from no co-sponsors just 15 16 17 years ago
[54:54.000 --> 55:05.040]  for ron paul the jig is up the truth is coming out and even you even have fed chairman in dalis
[55:05.040 --> 55:09.200]  in missouri that have come out and said the feds become destructive it was always destructive
[55:09.200 --> 55:13.680]  but we need to reform it we need to stop it we need to stop giving free money to these offshore
[55:13.680 --> 55:20.080]  elites we need to stop devaluing the dollar i happen to know people and i'll just leave it at that
[55:20.640 --> 55:28.160]  that know the kansas city and dalis fed heads and they know that this is going to destroy the
[55:28.160 --> 55:31.920]  country sure they don't mind being parts of big banks and running things back when they were
[55:31.920 --> 55:39.120]  actually giving some credit to people now it's purely a screw job purely a screw job and so
[55:39.120 --> 55:44.480]  even people in their own system don't want to be part of it don't want to wreck their children
[55:44.480 --> 55:50.320]  and grandchildren's future this will make us like pottersville when there's death in the streets
[55:50.320 --> 55:56.240]  that's what it creates we don't want that this broadcast is about exposing the hat trick exposing
[55:56.240 --> 56:02.800]  the scam now this clips about seven years old it was the outgoing head of the federal reserve
[56:03.520 --> 56:07.520]  right after he'd left alan greenspan who wrote books about the new world order
[56:07.520 --> 56:10.640]  and about the private federal reserve so they bought him off he was a smart economist
[56:10.640 --> 56:15.120]  friends with ron paul here he is they say on the lair news hour
[56:18.080 --> 56:22.640]  he's asked what is the role of federal reserve and he says well just that no other group of
[56:22.640 --> 56:29.520]  government can audit us or look at us and we're independent checks and balances on the three
[56:29.520 --> 56:35.600]  branches of government legislative executive judicial legislative controls the power of
[56:35.600 --> 56:43.200]  the purse not this fourth branch foreign robber baron bankers but that's how far we've come
[56:43.200 --> 56:49.280]  where there's the occupier if he was wearing a hitler monkey suit or a Stalin monkey suit
[56:49.280 --> 56:54.640]  or a fiddle Castro monkey suit no one would go along with it but it's a little man in a suit
[56:54.640 --> 57:02.400]  with little glasses in an american accent telling you this when he is as foreign as martians to our
[57:02.400 --> 57:10.720]  system now let's go to this clip i apply it i have the ideology because i believe that it
[57:10.720 --> 57:18.800]  is the best way of coming out the world and what type of policy what is the proper relationship
[57:18.800 --> 57:23.280]  what should be the proper relationship between a chairman of the fed and a president of the united
[57:23.280 --> 57:30.480]  states well first of all the federal reserve is an independent agency and that means basically that
[57:30.480 --> 57:39.040]  uh there is no other agency of government which can overrule actions that we take
[57:40.400 --> 57:48.160]  so long as that is in place and there is no evidence that the administration or the congress
[57:48.160 --> 57:53.920]  or anybody else is requesting that we do things other than what we think is the appropriate thing
[57:53.920 --> 58:02.720]  and then what the relationships are don't frankly matter and what a very profound statement
[58:04.560 --> 58:10.400]  what a profound statement it doesn't matter what congress thinks we're above the law no one can
[58:10.400 --> 58:20.640]  tell us what to do and we're an agency what like cobra like specter like the man in the moon i mean
[58:20.640 --> 58:26.160]  this is how our ignorance empowers the system and then i'm a conspiracy terrorist because i'm
[58:26.160 --> 58:32.960]  informed no and that line doesn't work anymore second hour masses of key global news and we'll
[58:32.960 --> 58:41.440]  talk to the northeast intelligence group coming up i'm alex jones info wars dot com thank you for

[01:00:57.680 --> 01:01:04.800]  yet i am boycotting it we downloaded it and bought it off google when they launched it
[01:01:04.800 --> 01:01:10.240]  wednesday to analyze it and that even felt immoral they staged a false flag to promote it
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:15.600]  that's basically come out but we'll be looking at that and breaking that down coming up
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:20.480]  we'll have open phones with our guests for your questions your comments
[01:01:21.280 --> 01:01:23.920]  what do you think the big globalist threat is in 2015
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:29.840]  do you think they're bold enough to pull a false flag even though folks are aware
[01:01:29.840 --> 01:01:36.400]  of terrorist false flags that's just some of the news that's going to be coming up here today
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:48.400]  we're also going to look at economics and what it signifies that japan's in so much trouble
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:57.680]  with their savings rate turning negative i'll also look at congress's uh backroom pension
[01:01:57.680 --> 01:02:06.480]  cutting deal it's even worse than expected as the la times uh reports i i didn't get to this
[01:02:07.920 --> 01:02:12.800]  before christmas when i saw it in the news wednesday so we're going to get to it today
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:19.280]  today fountain green holds first christmas light parade for terminally ill girl
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:24.800]  and it mentions his portal six-year-old quote dying of a brain disease
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:31.360]  and there's never a discussion about why these neurological disorders are exploding
[01:02:31.360 --> 01:02:36.640]  in the old and the young and how they're directly linked to gmo's vaccines you name it
[01:02:37.360 --> 01:02:42.160]  30 000 christmas cards were sent into this sweet little six-year-old and they had a big
[01:02:42.160 --> 01:02:46.640]  first-ever parade in the town for it i think that's very sweet and good it shows how folks will go
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:54.400]  out of their way over sentimental issues and for children but they use our love of children to try
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:03:00.240]  to restrict the second amendment implying guns hurt children as if guns cause the problem themselves
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:07.280]  not bad people and imagine if we could get every town upset about the private federal reserve in
[01:03:07.280 --> 01:03:13.360]  the new world order enough to send in 30 000 christmas cards or have parades just not even
[01:03:13.360 --> 01:03:20.880]  demonstrations but parades to rediscover america but see people go out and demonstrate
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.200]  for something that feels good and feels safe and doesn't feel controversial
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:31.920]  and it is that innate political correctness where folks will only go out and demonstrate
[01:03:31.920 --> 01:03:37.200]  for the love of a six-year-old girl i think that's the essence of the christmas spirit
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:46.800]  so i salute the people that did it but they need to engage the bigger issues
[01:03:48.160 --> 01:03:55.040]  if we're ever going to have any hope and look it's a start just 10 15 years ago we all remember
[01:03:55.040 --> 01:04:00.160]  they were taking down crosses christmas trees everywhere they were telling kids don't hand
[01:04:00.160 --> 01:04:04.400]  out christmas cards don't give each other presents at lunch the day before you get out of school
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:08.480]  as if free association wasn't okay to begin with they could have been handing out baseball
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:12.640]  cards at lunch it's their free speech they could have been handing out harry christian
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:19.920]  of pamphlets it's their free speech so in a way it is good to you know marry christmas do all this
[01:04:19.920 --> 01:04:26.240]  just to counter the political correctness even if you weren't a christian as if the consumerism's
[01:04:26.240 --> 01:04:32.720]  even about christ it's a holiday anybody can celebrate in its modern amalgamation but just
[01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:38.720]  imagine on the hardcore issues of gmo's and fluoride in the water or all these wars they're
[01:04:38.720 --> 01:04:45.920]  starting or just the host of issues the private fellow reserve if we could cover those issues
[01:04:45.920 --> 01:04:51.280]  and get the same fervor our problems would be over in a flash but we're reaching that tipping
[01:04:51.280 --> 01:04:56.000]  point that's why the system's moving in to try to start a civil war beforehand

[01:08:42.320 --> 01:08:48.960]  online vlog that reaches millions and of course they're frequent guests here and on coast to
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:55.600]  coast a m dot com i wanted to get them back on to ask them what they see is the biggest globalist
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:02.000]  threat what they expect the new world order to engage in in 2015 they're clearly moving to
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:08.560]  implode japan's economy russia's economy the criminal groups that run our nation
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:17.360]  are on record saying that they're crash the russian ruble which will then affect the e you
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:24.240]  will then affect japan uh japan's economy is in freefall right now their savings rate is now
[01:09:26.800 --> 01:09:31.760]  well here's the headline game over savings rate turns negative japanese economy begins to
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:38.640]  implode zero hedge but about a month ago it was revealed that japan's shadow economic advisor is
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:43.680]  none other than paul krugman we said it was only a matter of time before the japanese economy
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:50.160]  implodes terminally we didn't have long to wait and last night the barrage of japanese economic
[01:09:50.160 --> 01:10:01.280]  daddy pretty much assured japan's transition into a failed kainzian status system and then they go
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:07.280]  through breaking it down in fact after last night's abysmal japanese economic data we doubt even
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:12.480]  the most lobotomized kainzian voodoo priests have anything favorable left to say about
[01:10:13.680 --> 01:10:20.720]  the system not only did core inflation miss expectations and is now clearly in slowdown mode
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:29.200]  despite japan's openly monetizing all gross treasury insurance not only that industrial
[01:10:29.200 --> 01:10:35.600]  production declines 0.6 missing expectations on an increase and its record first decline in three
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:40.720]  months with durable goods shipments crashing not only did consumer spending plunge for the
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:47.600]  eighth straight month dropping 2.5 in november with real spending on housing in 20 freefall
[01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:53.600]  but the punchline with nominal and real wages imploding with total cash wages and overtime pay
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:59.920]  declined for the first time in nine months and 20 months respectively and they go over it now why
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:07.360]  does that matter we're told they've lowered oil prices to get the global economy going
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:16.160]  but separately opec and others in the last year made deals for two reasons shut down the russian
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:23.760]  economy that's based on oil and gas plunge the ruble but also shut down burgeoning oil
[01:11:23.760 --> 01:11:29.120]  exploration and shale exploration in canada the united states and mexico but mainly canada
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:33.840]  united states that is the only growing sector if you look at the fake numbers there's other
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:39.920]  growing sectors but if you look at shadow stats and others the only growing sector is oil and gas
[01:11:39.920 --> 01:11:47.520]  it is propping up the texas boom the dakotas boom and so many other areas of the country
[01:11:47.520 --> 01:11:53.840]  it's creating real jobs and the saudi princes are on record even the last issue of the economist
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:12:01.280]  it broke down the the the sheiks versus the wallcatters and they are lobbying at state and
[01:12:01.280 --> 01:12:07.200]  federal level to shut down obama has cut the number of permits by close to 40 percent the last
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:14.000]  six months won't let people drill there is a concerted effort to shut russia off and shut the
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:21.040]  us off and they sell it like yeah we're getting those ruse keys look at their ruble plunge yay
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:27.280]  well that's going to drag europe and then japan down thanks to fracking us will pass
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:33.040]  saudi arabian oil production again that's a report from march well not now with what obama's doing
[01:12:33.040 --> 01:12:40.000]  so what i'm getting at is there's this rigged global economy we think is americans or chinese or
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:47.840]  germans or russians or mexicans venezuelans south africans but really it's just these big globalist
[01:12:47.840 --> 01:12:53.200]  operations there's bloomberg the relentless production of shale oil is breaking opex neck
[01:12:54.800 --> 01:12:59.360]  that's bloomberg see the only reason i show you these headlines is this is not my opinion this
[01:12:59.360 --> 01:13:04.800]  is admitted this is going on so there's an economic war going on not between the us and russia
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:12.640]  the us is the muscle being used to destroy russia economically right now but that also hurts us
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:18.640]  so why is it being done it's also immoral to try to stop russia selling its oil and gas
[01:13:19.600 --> 01:13:24.640]  that would drive down prices at a reasonable level and would regionally distribute the energy
[01:13:24.640 --> 01:13:34.160]  systems instead they're shutting them off to cause a global recession into depression in some areas
[01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:40.480]  which will cause more global unrest more globally stabilization which the large central banks use
[01:13:40.480 --> 01:13:46.160]  to buy up and consolidate power and control in their own words so that's why i'm hammering on
[01:13:46.160 --> 01:13:53.040]  the federal reserve today the european arm of a private banking cartel inside the us so that people
[01:13:53.040 --> 01:13:59.840]  think about the top of the pyramid they all seeing eye and not blacks and whites killing each other
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:05.520]  not people randomly shooting cops not cops thinking as the public as enemies as we all
[01:14:05.520 --> 01:14:10.640]  descend on each other like a bunch of idiots and i played this clip probably 30 times i want to play
[01:14:10.640 --> 01:14:16.480]  it again can we cue up from russia to love at the start of the film where they plan to play off
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:23.680]  and they'll keep our guests a little bit the next hour they were and this is based on in
[01:14:23.680 --> 01:14:29.360]  flaming's real things that happened that the spy chief then put into fiction to get around the
[01:14:29.360 --> 01:14:35.600]  classification rules where there were banking cartels that were offshore literally on yachts
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:41.360]  manipulating different criminal groups and playing the russians and the us and off against each other
[01:14:41.360 --> 01:14:47.040]  for economic gain this is how the real world works let's go to the film from the 1960s
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:58.640]  sami's fighting fish fascinating creatures brave but not the whole stupid yes they're stupid
[01:14:59.680 --> 01:15:04.560]  except for the occasional one such as we have here let's the other two fight
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:12.000]  and he waits
[01:15:13.600 --> 01:15:18.080]  waits until the survivor is so exhausted that he cannot defend himself
[01:15:19.360 --> 01:15:28.640]  and then like specter he strikes i find the parallel music our organization did not arrange
[01:15:28.640 --> 01:15:37.520]  for you to come over from the russians just for amusement number three come in cronstein all right
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:44.160]  that's enough 1963 the same year they killed kennedy let's go to dug in joe hagman of hagman
[01:15:44.160 --> 01:15:49.280]  and hagman father and son investigators with all their great sources a lot of great intel over the
[01:15:49.280 --> 01:15:54.720]  years we've gotten from them on what they see coming in the new year i see economic warfare maybe
[01:15:54.720 --> 01:15:58.960]  false flags to blame domestic groups they're definitely i remember you were on with us two years
[01:15:58.960 --> 01:16:04.960]  ago and i didn't roll my eyes dug because you'd given me a lot of intel that that that really
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:09.840]  turned out to be accurate over the years but you said from your fbi and homeland security sources
[01:16:09.840 --> 01:16:15.520]  they said the justice department is going to go to the next level even though uh they didn't think
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:20.400]  they could get it going with the whole zimmerman thing that they're going to go to race war and
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:24.960]  then war on the police and then that has now happened give us the latest intel on what's
[01:16:24.960 --> 01:16:31.680]  unfolding elix thanks for having us on the show again and you know a very good clip by the way
[01:16:31.680 --> 01:16:38.960]  from the 1963 movie um the the bait of fish the siamese fighting fish obviously puff up
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:45.280]  when they see another male of the species so this is what's happening here perfect correlation
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:52.080]  of what's happening here but uh to cut to the real uh part of the matter here aside from people like
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:57.360]  michael groenwald from politico saying everything's awesome or reporting everything's awesome what
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:02.640]  we're seeing happen here today i believe based on our sources um in the larger sense and then we
[01:17:02.640 --> 01:17:09.440]  can the macro sense that we can uh uh burrow it down but the macro sense what we've got is uh
[01:17:09.440 --> 01:17:16.960]  geopolitically we've got russia and america at odds and an economic warfare very similar to what
[01:17:16.960 --> 01:17:23.280]  we saw with america and in japan prior to world war two uh you had the economic sanctions against
[01:17:23.280 --> 01:17:28.800]  japan the embargo and bam it turned into pearl harbor in a hot war i think that we're we're seeing
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:36.000]  that run up right now the parallels are are just indeed incredible to that to the 1940-41
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:45.040]  uh era time period and uh if we keep in mind alexa right now well as of 2013 for example
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:53.360]  oil natural gas accounted for 68 of almost 70 percent of russia's total export revenues for
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:59.840]  2013 so what we're doing is essentially and we've got a three pronged approach against russia we're
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:05.680]  we're hitting them economically with the oil and gas uh glut prices whatever you want to call it
[01:18:05.680 --> 01:18:12.400]  via Saudi Arabia the Saudi agenda you've got the attack on the ruble asymmetrically against russia
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:20.240]  and then you've got the uh the more open and overt warfare the lines of battle which includes
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:25.760]  syria and ukraine so we're we're actually giving them a three pronged kind of battlefield which
[01:18:25.760 --> 01:18:30.640]  is going on that's the macro of everything i believe so while people are rejoicing over
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:35.600]  a two dollar and 38 cent gallon of gas under the people that understand where that's coming from
[01:18:35.600 --> 01:18:42.240]  and why we've got that having said all of that drilling down domestically you've got the very
[01:18:42.240 --> 01:18:47.680]  same globalists who are inking out and enjoyed a lot of research on this inking out the geopolitical
[01:18:47.680 --> 01:18:52.720]  affairs you've got this very same globalist and our sources are telling us in person and
[01:18:52.720 --> 01:19:01.040]  and in other means that uh not only is the domestic situation with respect to race wars
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:09.440]  going to increase there will be uh just a full court press for additional race wars we saw that
[01:19:09.440 --> 01:19:15.520]  happen nearby Ferguson over over this last holiday and i think what's going to happen is more and more
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:20.080]  you're going to have police being shot at police being killed this is going to usher in a new level
[01:19:20.080 --> 01:19:27.280]  of draconian laws against the citizens and by the way the sony hack uh if i can just reference
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:31.360]  that too and i don't want to seem like i'm going all over the place the sony hack does figure
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:36.640]  prominently into this the cyber security stay there i want to come back and get joe's take

[01:25:32.400 --> 01:25:37.200]  dot com this is short segment with a hagman and hagman there was this for about 10 15 minutes
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:44.800]  in the next hour dug and joe hagman i want to go back and i don't want to get some of the economic
[01:25:44.800 --> 01:25:51.920]  data that your son joe has because i know he does a lot of the deep research but dug specifically
[01:25:51.920 --> 01:25:58.960]  you kept harping two years ago that that their main strategy was race war we'd caught the justice
[01:25:58.960 --> 01:26:04.640]  department involved stirring up the some of the riots smaller riots that happened they were of
[01:26:04.640 --> 01:26:09.840]  course upset about the fact they were small not to sting people that'd be bad enough but to actually
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:17.360]  get it going what does obama and the people he's got running his operation think they're going to
[01:26:17.360 --> 01:26:21.840]  do by stirring up race riots in this country what's the end game of that because i know you
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:27.360]  have some sources in homeland security you said are really freaked out about this and this attempt
[01:26:27.360 --> 01:26:34.800]  to play the public off against local law enforcement what is the end game and how was that going for
[01:26:34.800 --> 01:26:43.200]  them you know alex from my perspective and from my sources it's the end game objective here is to
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:47.840]  first of all create the chaos create the problem and then of course come in
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:55.520]  with the solution and the solution is going to be a very large scale draconian style
[01:26:55.520 --> 01:27:01.680]  now even a martial law scenario type of thing to to really oppress the people and take away our
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:06.800]  rights and as you said two years ago and now it's happening well yes geographically and
[01:27:07.440 --> 01:27:14.080]  little pockets in the end around the country but the people at dhs according to my dhs source which
[01:27:14.080 --> 01:27:20.880]  is a different one than than two years ago i got handed off in that respect the same look you know
[01:27:20.880 --> 01:27:26.400]  well they are getting very impatient with respect to the fact that this is not happening fast enough
[01:27:26.400 --> 01:27:33.040]  so they very well might create or exacerbate already existing situations so they can advance
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:39.440]  this objective and i know jose talked to my sources as well and does his own research to the extent
[01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:46.880]  that our both of our sources both of our research it does match up and this is coming alex and as
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:52.160]  you pointed out many times this is coming indeed it is to divide conquer from well sure i mean we've
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:55.760]  caught the justice department stirring it up over and over again with the controlled media
[01:27:56.400 --> 01:28:01.200]  so that's proof right there but the fact that your source has said this was the plan
[01:28:01.200 --> 01:28:08.000]  two years ago we now see it being executed i think the good news is is that obama is i
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:13.040]  guess frustrated then that it's not happening on a big enough scale i guess the public too smart for
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:21.920]  that well yeah and jose talking about this earlier it's the people the alternative media right now
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:28.560]  is really making a difference in terms of people's the people are awake people like you and and us
[01:28:28.560 --> 01:28:32.480]  talking to people are it's starting to make a difference and it's and quite frankly starting
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:38.400]  to hack off the people that are trying to push forward this agenda so you know now you can throw
[01:28:38.400 --> 01:28:44.720]  in the cyber security bill on top of this or you know the sony hack which will perhaps lead to a
[01:28:44.720 --> 01:28:49.200]  cyber security bill jose i love research i want to get your take we're going to come back and throw
[01:28:49.200 --> 01:28:54.800]  it to joe on the sony hack and on the economic data that on the oil war that's going on with the
[01:28:54.800 --> 01:28:59.520]  soddies the russians in the us but but briefly in the minute we've got before we're going to break
[01:28:59.520 --> 01:29:06.640]  any other intel on the civil unrest that the globalists are trying to stir up watch this spring
[01:29:06.640 --> 01:29:12.160]  and this summer that's uh words directly from my source of dhs is going to get very hot in
[01:29:12.160 --> 01:29:18.320]  this country if they have their way more cops getting executed well that that's a given and
[01:29:18.320 --> 01:29:25.120]  it's going to lead up to a uh summer of discontent summer of 1968 style you're looking for a tipping
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:30.400]  point yeah yeah well al gore said two years ago we needed an arab spring here in america
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:35.040]  yeah well he sits in his mansion with arm guards he wants a bunch of teenagers
[01:29:35.040 --> 01:29:39.280]  go around burning stuff down and shooting cops in the head i mean that's what an arab spring
[01:29:39.280 --> 01:29:44.960]  would be here folks a bunch of stupid leftists running around shooting people we'll be back stay

[01:33:54.560 --> 01:34:00.560]  wrote the book i don't say that figuratively i say that in reality on the police state i made the
[01:34:00.560 --> 01:34:06.800]  films on the police state that's because i'm against a police state but being against a police state
[01:34:06.800 --> 01:34:14.640]  like north korea or mexico does not mean you're against the police the final agreement the
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:21.120]  the final ingredient of a police state is a civil war a destabilization campaign
[01:34:22.640 --> 01:34:28.400]  more students have now come up missing being kidnapped others have been dug up dead in mexico
[01:34:29.120 --> 01:34:32.480]  major capitals in mexico state capitals have fallen
[01:34:32.480 --> 01:34:36.080]  on universities are on fire
[01:34:39.360 --> 01:34:45.520]  that has been orchestrated from without to a great extent this is a destabilization campaign
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:52.240]  it can be done here the controllers will sit back overseas and watch this unfold
[01:34:52.240 --> 01:34:57.520]  that's why we're trying to expose it a toll-free number to join us if you've got any questions
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:06.400]  or comments for our guest on the topics we've raised today 800-259-9231 first-time callers again

[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:34.480]  chops and they want to shut up the people they disagree with never forget that we have a chance
[01:35:34.480 --> 01:35:39.120]  to beat the globalist that's why they want to shut us up so your prayers your support spreading
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:46.560]  the word about the broadcast isn't needed it's absolutely essential you are the info war you
[01:35:46.560 --> 01:35:53.440]  are the resistance so i salute all of you out there as we accelerate towards 2015 okay going back
[01:35:53.440 --> 01:35:59.280]  to doug hagman and joe hagman of the northeast intelligence network go ahead get into the data
[01:35:59.280 --> 01:36:03.600]  that you had joe break that down and then we're going to start going to some phone calls i also
[01:36:03.600 --> 01:36:08.480]  want you guys to raise any topics that that are front and center for you instead of me just asking
[01:36:08.480 --> 01:36:15.040]  the questions so you guys have the floor thanks alex well you said right at the top of the hour
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:21.520]  when you brought us on was was very accurate now they're destabilizing the economies in a way that
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:28.640]  they destabilize the governments of syria and libya they're destabilizing these countries economies
[01:36:28.640 --> 01:36:39.280]  for a fiscal reconciliation under the imf and world bank to have this global economic rebalancing
[01:36:39.280 --> 01:36:45.520]  act that we're seeing here in 2015 i think i hope i'm wrong but i think we will see it in a big way
[01:36:45.520 --> 01:36:53.520]  in 2015 a lot of their monetary policy seems to shift towards more extreme monetary policy to
[01:36:53.520 --> 01:36:58.720]  tighten certain economies to loosen other economies like we're seeing with russia in an imf document
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:04.640]  from 2014 and a world bank document both they talk about the upcoming russian inflation and how to
[01:37:04.640 --> 01:37:10.880]  manage it in a way through fiscal policy that doesn't allow for rampant inflation but they're
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:15.280]  going to control it in a way where they're strengthening they say the russian economy
[01:37:15.280 --> 01:37:22.320]  and rebalancing it with less government control and that's what they say here in their international
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:28.080]  monetary fund world economic outlook from 2014 and the the world bank has a similar publication
[01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:33.520]  from the same month it's a global economic rebalancing act and they're getting their pieces
[01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:39.440]  in place for what they want to do in the next phase of their initiative and elix this amazed me
[01:37:39.440 --> 01:37:43.840]  the most when he brought me these documents and he said look everything that's happening right now
[01:37:43.840 --> 01:37:49.680]  it has been laid out and planned by the globalists and here it is that's what's so frustrating i'm
[01:37:49.680 --> 01:37:54.160]  trying to give you guys the floor because you got a lot of key data to get out but exactly 95 of what
[01:37:54.160 --> 01:38:00.160]  we cover and you cover is just an admission they just call it good they go we're helping russia
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:05.040]  when we plunge their ruble we're helping when we start cutting their you know their exports off
[01:38:05.040 --> 01:38:09.760]  we're helping it's it's the sixth speech but they admit it's all being orchestrated go ahead
[01:38:10.720 --> 01:38:15.040]  no it's just i want to i just want to back him up when he brought this to me i looked at it i thought
[01:38:15.040 --> 01:38:19.440]  well it's exactly what's happening now written two years ago telling us exactly what they were
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:24.960]  going to do and it's and as you say it's very frustrating to us when we're looking at this
[01:38:24.960 --> 01:38:30.160]  we're handing this out this information out and saying look this was planned this is orchestrated
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:36.080]  none of this is coincidence or by accident this is all orchestrated and it's economic warfare
[01:38:36.080 --> 01:38:42.560]  and and and i don't think people understand how critical and and how deadly potentially deadly
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:48.240]  this this warfare is i mean we could we could be looking at nukes i mean at the worst bad worst
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:54.000]  case scenario here's the headline right now russia receives military doctrine changes it
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:59.360]  lists nato buildup is number one threat i mean russia is starting to go from a very passive
[01:38:59.360 --> 01:39:06.640]  role into a very aggressive role right now yeah president putin uh approve this new military
[01:39:06.640 --> 01:39:15.040]  doctrine just today listing nato and the us uh as enemies and as um security concerns so there you go
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:20.080]  the cold war is back on but now it's hot and now russia has announced it's it's getting ready to
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:29.040]  deploy uh it's new supersonic uh nuke tipped icbms exactly and elix when we look at this we look at
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:36.240]  this joe and i do through the prism of syria for example because one of the biggest and i would
[01:39:36.240 --> 01:39:42.240]  say this everyone keep their eyes so glued on syria because that is still the prize here syria
[01:39:42.240 --> 01:39:49.120]  the destabilization takeover of syria and then ripping turkey out of nato and siding with russia
[01:39:49.120 --> 01:39:55.120]  will be the somewhat of the collateral effect of that so the bottom line here is we're going to see
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:40:01.040]  a lot of what we're seeing is economic warfare right now with some hot wars by proxy however
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:06.080]  when this happens i do believe that lives will be often we're gonna see that's right the average
[01:40:06.080 --> 01:40:11.200]  person's watching espn right now where guys are wearing suits and ties all real excited about
[01:40:11.200 --> 01:40:17.280]  football games while meanwhile it's well known that us special forces have been forced to be in there
[01:40:17.280 --> 01:40:21.920]  and they're very upset about it advising the extremist that run the ukrainian government
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:26.000]  to attack the russians and i don't have a dog in this fight i'm not russian or ukrainian
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:32.080]  but the west and george soros have bragged they started it and in my book it's not right to come
[01:40:32.080 --> 01:40:37.280]  up to somebody's border and start bloodying their nose and then not expecting them to retaliate how
[01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:44.320]  do you guys expect russia to retaliate in an asymmetrical proxy war way against being encircled
[01:40:44.320 --> 01:40:50.160]  and being messed with well i think it was wired magazine who said 2015 would be the year of the
[01:40:50.160 --> 01:40:58.160]  hack and i see this um you know the sony hack is a is a run up as a testing um per se a pilot
[01:40:58.160 --> 01:41:04.240]  program to their what they call the phantom menace uh technique and warfare and this is what they're
[01:41:04.240 --> 01:41:09.760]  going to do is use proxies to hack uh that we know that the medical industry is a soft target as they
[01:41:09.760 --> 01:41:15.600]  list it and we have you know a huge push into this e-commerce we have e-banking now everybody
[01:41:15.600 --> 01:41:20.960]  does their banking online and you know through economic warfare they could hack bank accounts
[01:41:20.960 --> 01:41:27.520]  they could hack uh private public government or under the the guys and with government cooperation
[01:41:27.520 --> 01:41:32.880]  make it appear as though they did uh just like we saw with the sony hack they're running a north korea
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:38.080]  um investigation show north korea had nothing to do with it other than possibly being a proxy
[01:41:38.080 --> 01:41:46.160]  nation which was used as a intermediary between who did attack them and and uh so you know what they
[01:41:46.160 --> 01:41:50.880]  call the phantom menace is a is a kind of like terrorism you can't point a finger at him you
[01:41:50.880 --> 01:41:57.200]  can't identify an individual but uh they get a general idea to to make up this false enemy
[01:41:57.200 --> 01:42:02.160]  and this is what they're planning on doing in 2015 uh and this will push in what you talked about
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:08.800]  the cyber security bills and the internet security bills this will strengthen the public's uh backing
[01:42:08.800 --> 01:42:15.280]  of these bills once they realize that their economic uh their economies their own bank
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:20.080]  accounts aren't safe their health records aren't safe as we move towards a push on electronic health
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:24.800]  records uh the american people are going to the more hacks we see the more the american people
[01:42:24.800 --> 01:42:29.680]  are going to push to have these laws implemented further restricting the freedom of the internet
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:35.920]  and uh policing it more yeah and you know that's right if i can interject one thing
[01:42:35.920 --> 01:42:42.000]  i'll go on record today right now by saying this we saw what they did with the film innocence of
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:48.160]  muslims and using that as the pretext for the for what happened in Benghazi the fingerprints of the
[01:42:48.160 --> 01:42:54.800]  cia and in specific and in particular john o brennan all over that through proxy companies
[01:42:54.800 --> 01:43:00.880]  ngo's i'm gonna tell you right here right now if you if uh uh it based on my investigation
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:06.720]  and research supplemented by joe here i gotta tell you uh look inward look at our own intelligence
[01:43:06.720 --> 01:43:13.120]  agencies with respect to the sony hack to pass um the cyber security act and other draconian
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:19.840]  legislation against the internet and against uh internet uh uh well against the internet as a whole
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:25.760]  and as joe said uh and look for more soft target attacks or attacks against our soft targets in
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:35.920]  2015 in particular the health care system that will usher in an entirely new type of uh arrangement
[01:43:35.920 --> 01:43:41.120]  with respect to exactly they'll claim obama care is not working well because of hacks you can see
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:46.320]  how their mindset works what about physical attacks they say they're gearing up for patriots
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:51.760]  to blow stuff up with zero evidence i mean i see them in the movies the culture priming the public
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:59.600]  mind for domestic physical attacks bombs truck bombs mass shootings to be blamed on the globalist
[01:43:59.600 --> 01:44:06.960]  opposition the liberty movement any information on that yeah i mean uh we see with what they're
[01:44:06.960 --> 01:44:11.600]  trying to do by stirring up racial tensions in different parts of the country and we talked
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:15.920]  about how they're trying to reach a tipping point i think that the american people are going to
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:21.680]  come together rather than uh pull each other apart and they're going to see that their options are
[01:44:21.680 --> 01:44:27.280]  far and fewer to get this tipping point reached so i believe they will pull out as much uh you
[01:44:27.280 --> 01:44:32.960]  know we saw with isis how when syria wasn't we weren't the public would not allow the the government
[01:44:32.960 --> 01:44:38.640]  to strike syria and they repackaged the threat into the isis threat throughout a couple of be
[01:44:38.640 --> 01:44:43.600]  heading videos and now we have this huge enemy isis that we never see about or hear about unless
[01:44:43.600 --> 01:44:48.400]  you know they have some kind of propaganda video or or a piece of news that is out there
[01:44:48.400 --> 01:44:54.400]  i think they'll just repackage the threat and continue to push until they reach an emergence
[01:44:54.400 --> 01:45:00.240]  or a crisis point where they think that they can gain the upper hand and turn it into a full blown
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:05.680]  tipping point and into a crisis that they won't allow or go to waste they're looking for that one
[01:45:05.680 --> 01:45:11.680]  incident that's all i think oklahoma city style operation and did to blame the patriot groups and
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:18.800]  those second amendment bitter clingers if you will it's so obvious though now false flag has
[01:45:18.800 --> 01:45:24.880]  entered the vernacular of the military the police the public they've got to be scared every time
[01:45:24.880 --> 01:45:28.960]  they pull a false flag now our people are there with cameras we keep catching them that's why
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:33.440]  they moved on to other types of economic and propaganda false flags but they're licking their
[01:45:33.440 --> 01:45:38.800]  chops they just be better be really careful the next one they pull because we're going to be their
[01:45:38.800 --> 01:45:45.040]  day one holding their feet to the fire everybody knows who has a motive to blow stuff up and blame
[01:45:45.040 --> 01:45:49.520]  the patriots everybody knows the the whole political structure republican leadership and
[01:45:49.520 --> 01:45:52.720]  democratic leadership are against the liberty movement because we are the people that know
[01:45:52.720 --> 01:45:56.880]  the federal reserves private we're the people that know where the bodies are buried we know how
[01:45:56.880 --> 01:46:01.760]  stuff works we know how to tie our shoelaces and why per noses we're nothing special we just know
[01:46:01.760 --> 01:46:06.400]  how real politics works and it's that knowledge that scares them well that knowledge has now
[01:46:06.400 --> 01:46:13.120]  been diversified to where it's it's in tens of millions of people and we've got humat or human
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:20.080]  intelligence organically operating everywhere that is basically unstoppable i don't know what the
[01:46:20.080 --> 01:46:27.760]  system thinks they're going to pull because now every angle we've got covered every angle where
[01:46:27.760 --> 01:46:32.960]  they're countering them day one i don't mean my show or your show i mean it is frightening how
[01:46:32.960 --> 01:46:37.120]  powerful the liberty movement is and how it's exponentially growing that's really got a scare
[01:46:37.120 --> 01:46:42.800]  of the system but but you know alexa they can actually change history they can create false
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:48.480]  news reports uh joe is getting into into that how the the plans the infrastructure is laid for that
[01:46:50.000 --> 01:46:55.760]  right now we're doing investigations attempting to get uh documentation and this is something else
[01:46:55.760 --> 01:47:04.080]  by the way um with respect to obama who obama is receiving or looking at uh various uh uh
[01:47:04.080 --> 01:47:09.360]  documents that that were once that once existed no longer exist i mean they can destroy documents
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:14.080]  change documents that will it seems like it's just an amazing thing what's taking place with
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:19.120]  respect to the well they're creating a fog of war a fog of confusion but at the end of the day
[01:47:19.120 --> 01:47:24.560]  there's no confidence in them but joe get into specifically uh they announced last year to quote
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:28.560]  counter the drudge report and others they're going to launch uh intelligence operations
[01:47:28.560 --> 01:47:33.360]  domestically for dis info um but still i don't see that working you're right they can memory
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:38.880]  hold stuff they can plant stuff on facebook or twitter they can create fake videos fake audios
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:46.480]  edit things uh what specifically are you getting it there's a a new publication out titled state
[01:47:46.480 --> 01:47:53.760]  actor threats in 2025 and in this document they talk about generating false uh news reports they
[01:47:53.760 --> 01:47:58.720]  talk about computer graphics and how the um technology has increased so much over the years
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:03.600]  that through artificial intelligence inside and computer graphics they'll be able to
[01:48:03.600 --> 01:48:08.320]  show us troops committing acts of war or show us leaders or other people saying things that they
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:14.080]  never said um creating these you know fake videos having the media companies report on them is news
[01:48:14.080 --> 01:48:20.720]  only to later come out and say that they were uh lies this there he is mad dog ben richards the
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:25.440]  brutal slayer of a hundred men women and children in bakersfield and they show the footage of
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:29.520]  swartz and anger committing the atrocity when really he tried to stop the atrocity in the
[01:48:29.520 --> 01:48:34.080]  running man the running man is now here and again give folks the name of that u.s government document
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:43.280]  you just read it is called the state actors threats in 2025 state actor threats 2025 and
[01:48:43.280 --> 01:48:48.080]  remember anything they say 2025 is now they always say it's out there it's not scared of the public
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:53.840]  and then that that's a seven-year-old document basically that that's been out there for a long
[01:48:53.840 --> 01:48:58.720]  time that's been buried underneath all kinds of other documentation he was actually uh initially
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:06.880]  submitted in 2007 and that was war college him yeah but the reformulated now to uh to the current
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:12.160]  so it's interesting the abstract and the contents have been updated and i would urge everyone to
[01:49:12.160 --> 01:49:16.720]  research that you know definitely because it's it's really extremely i think the bottom line
[01:49:16.720 --> 01:49:22.000]  is we are all now in buck rogersville we're now in a science fiction movie oh yeah with the brain
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:27.200]  uploads and the and the passive brain scanners and the face scanners and the and the gmo's and
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:32.960]  the nano tech and all of it this is out of control i mean the world is out of control
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:36.960]  and the government's busy worrying about christians that own guns who aren't criminals
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:42.880]  i mean that shows you how crazy the elite are that they're so evil they're worried about moral people
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:49.040]  exactly and i'm not sure i'm not so sure that deblazio from new york and and even obama and
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:54.400]  holder obama at a lesser extent but but press holder and deblazio expected the blowback
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:50:02.080]  that they got with respect to the uh to their policy so i you know the the objectives always and
[01:50:02.080 --> 01:50:06.160]  joe and i were talking about this where the objectives are always the same the racial war
[01:50:06.160 --> 01:50:11.360]  for the racial tensions they divide and conquer with from within i mean it's always there but you
[01:50:11.360 --> 01:50:18.640]  know we're i i think through the alternative media we are actually pushing toward um educating
[01:50:18.640 --> 01:50:24.480]  people and getting people a little by the way the pentagon uh hillary clinton the white house
[01:50:24.480 --> 01:50:31.360]  the think tanks all admit that what they call liberty-based truth-based media is really hurting
[01:50:31.360 --> 01:50:35.600]  them i mean they admit we're hurting them so so that should be some positive news because the
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:40.240]  reason we're hurting them is we're decompartmentalizing these agencies where people are in the
[01:50:40.240 --> 01:50:44.720]  agencies they have part of the info we're deep we're decompartmentalizing from the outside
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:48.720]  they're able to see we're telling the truth which then causes our credibility to go up
[01:50:48.720 --> 01:50:53.440]  then we start getting fed more intel the people inside start resisting more and then that puts

[01:54:06.800 --> 01:54:14.320]  tyranny what you do about it is up to you but i know this standing up saying no will have an
[01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:19.120]  effect overall it's really just that simple none of us have to save the world by ourselves
[01:54:19.120 --> 01:54:24.560]  we've all just got to try to get informed and inform others and we will certainly dial back
[01:54:24.560 --> 01:54:28.160]  a lot of this tyranny our guest will be with us 20 minutes the next hour then we're doing
[01:54:28.160 --> 01:54:34.080]  some special reports on the interview and breaking that down i want to go to derrick elinor chris
[01:54:34.080 --> 01:54:39.440]  bill denise and others derrick from wyoming you're on the air with our guest what do you have to say
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:44.560]  hey elin thanks for having me on thanks to the hagman guys
[01:54:45.200 --> 01:54:49.600]  say it's i'll just have to say this is good to be saved i got saved about four years ago and i
[01:54:49.600 --> 01:54:54.480]  think you know what's this uh everything that's going on it's much easier to share the true gospel
[01:54:54.480 --> 01:55:03.040]  of christ and you know um i'm very excited about what's going on um and it's not in a good way i
[01:55:03.040 --> 01:55:08.560]  guess but but i you know if we know this history truly we can paint a geopolitical picture that's
[01:55:08.560 --> 01:55:15.040]  so dark there is only one light and a lot of these churches are still state run so counterfeit
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:20.320]  that i find them in smaller and smaller places uh and men of god true men of god are very frustrated
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:24.560]  and some of them don't want to look at it some of these smaller passes and such and they know a lot
[01:55:24.560 --> 01:55:28.960]  of this true well i think you're hitting the nail on the head here the one of our biggest problems
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:34.240]  is state-run media state-run churches the faith-based initiative things like that i appreciate your
[01:55:34.240 --> 01:55:39.440]  call let me get our guest take on that whole agenda to turn the churches into nothing but
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:46.320]  government mouthpieces absolutely and this is where both pastors and congregants need to understand
[01:55:46.320 --> 01:55:51.520]  that reading you know the word themselves doing the research themselves whether it's in scripture
[01:55:51.520 --> 01:55:58.480]  or in world events is essential no one can depend on another person for their information or their
[01:55:58.480 --> 01:56:05.280]  learning and in doing so we forfeit you know so much so we have to continue to strive to learn
[01:56:06.080 --> 01:56:10.880]  on our own and we can't put that burden on anybody else or expect anybody else to tell
[01:56:10.880 --> 01:56:18.960]  us the whole truth we need to seek ourselves that's very important all right let's go to
[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:24.800]  another caller here uh bill in florida you're on the air welcome hey alex thanks for taking
[01:56:24.800 --> 01:56:30.240]  my call big fan thank you brother i just want i just wanted to know if you guys have heard about the
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:36.400]  fbi menthins division issuing a warning to local police about an isis threat to blow up the menthins
[01:56:36.400 --> 01:56:43.840]  arkansas uh bridge spanning the mississippi river this month yeah well actually we've been following
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:49.520]  a couple of fbi bulletins uh we belong to uh the national counterterror terrorism officers
[01:56:49.520 --> 01:56:55.840]  association we get the the inside track on various threats and i gotta tell you the isis threat in
[01:56:55.840 --> 01:57:02.720]  america whether it's the hoover dam or los vegas or new york or los angeles i mean pick a place
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:09.760]  pick a scenario it's there it's out there and it seems like a lot of these are uh well they're
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:15.520]  issued with less than credible perhaps information and maybe as they put it with an over abundance of
[01:57:15.520 --> 01:57:22.720]  caution however uh there's really we've seen nothing credible in terms of uh of a serious
[01:57:22.720 --> 01:57:29.040]  terrorist type attack however however the southern port southern border the very poor southern border
[01:57:29.040 --> 01:57:35.840]  has let a lot of state actors in including but not limited to isis and others so i mean it's it's
[01:57:36.480 --> 01:57:42.240]  it's really a multi-dimensional or a multi-level chess game at play here this way in my view if
[01:57:42.240 --> 01:57:47.520]  isis is running around taking down countries killing hundreds of thousands of people why wouldn't they
[01:57:47.520 --> 01:57:51.840]  be attacking us when the borders open and we know they're coming in unless they're being held on a
[01:57:51.840 --> 01:57:56.240]  tight leash by the west that helped get them funded and helped them stand up helped them get
[01:57:56.240 --> 01:58:00.800]  their operations rolling doesn't mean they're totally controlled but they were fed and coddled and
[01:58:00.800 --> 01:58:05.600]  you know raised like a bucket of rattlesnakes before they were dumped on us and they had been
[01:58:05.600 --> 01:58:10.400]  deployed into the u.s along with other sleeper groups that will then be activated by criminal
[01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:15.280]  groups in the global combine and the terrorists that will attack us even when we'll never even
[01:58:15.280 --> 01:58:20.160]  know the big picture you agree with that breakdown dug no absolutely hundred percent yeah i could
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:24.800]  not have said that better and and that's uh i'm sure joe i think director i want to get joe's
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:30.000]  take on it in 60 seconds a third hour coming up we're going to continue with phone calls uh thank

[02:00:31.360 --> 02:00:38.240]  for myself or our guest hagman and hagman investigative reporters and criminal investigators
[02:00:39.440 --> 02:00:47.360]  private investigators um going back to doug uh and and joe joe you've got some comments uh on
[02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:52.480]  the the radical groups they're allowing into the country i mean obama has been openly allowing
[02:00:52.480 --> 02:00:57.760]  radical islamists and the funding out of kinnia uh into egypt and and and and they're moving to
[02:00:57.760 --> 02:01:04.000]  indict a bunch of americans over in uh egypt right now i mean this is just crazy how criminal our
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:09.520]  elites are what's your take on that no you're absolutely right they are criminal to the to
[02:01:09.520 --> 02:01:15.600]  the worst extent possible and i believe that um ice is much like al qaeda you know they're prime
[02:01:15.600 --> 02:01:22.160]  in the pump conditioning the american public to uh understand that there there is some kind of attack
[02:01:22.160 --> 02:01:29.920]  coming whether it is on the uh field of the world or it's a cyber attack um they are getting ready
[02:01:29.920 --> 02:01:36.720]  to do something and i believe that much like we saw in 9 11 that the government knows a lot of
[02:01:36.720 --> 02:01:41.120]  what's going on in in the middle east and knows a lot of the threats with the ability from the
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:47.200]  anise to to monitor everyone's conversations in in real time um i don't see how they could
[02:01:47.200 --> 02:01:53.840]  have a threat a true threat go through undetected so i believe that a lot of this is the staging
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:02:00.720]  the um getting ready for and possibly if they needed to the carrying out of a terrorist attack
[02:02:01.920 --> 02:02:06.640]  i agree well there's obvious motive by the establishment to allow attacks to happen or
[02:02:06.640 --> 02:02:10.880]  actually carry the mounted stage them to get more power it's a simple equation but it just
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:17.680]  doesn't work anymore chris in fema region 10 i guess you're up in uh the pacific northwest
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:26.400]  somewhere chris yes sir hey alex jones and uh doug hagman i really really enjoy really really
[02:02:26.400 --> 02:02:31.600]  appreciate your service to the country and i keep you guys in my prayer so god bless you god bless
[02:02:31.600 --> 02:02:38.720]  you um thank you what i wanted to ask is i want to talk about the misdirection um that i that i see
[02:02:38.720 --> 02:02:44.560]  i mean we're always looking for who's responsible uh we hear a lot about the british elite the uh
[02:02:44.560 --> 02:02:52.240]  dutch elite uh the rop childs uh soros and all these guys but where do all roads lead it seems
[02:02:52.240 --> 02:02:58.160]  like all roads lead to roam the smallest country in the world is also the richest the vatican holds
[02:02:58.160 --> 02:03:04.080]  the quarter of the world's gold they are at the top of the pyramid they're controlling all these
[02:03:04.080 --> 02:03:08.960]  people i just want to get your take on that you want my take or doug's take or just take i would
[02:03:08.960 --> 02:03:15.280]  love all three of your take on it okay uh doug you take it first well i you know i i think all
[02:03:15.280 --> 02:03:23.600]  roads do lead to roam as well as well they've got the um offshoots or interchanges in the city of
[02:03:23.600 --> 02:03:29.760]  london as well as washington dc i you know i look i i think at the bottom at the end of the day
[02:03:29.760 --> 02:03:35.360]  what they're trying to do here is create a one world system of governance elix you talk about this
[02:03:35.360 --> 02:03:39.920]  you've got the one world economy one world global governance i was about to say it's the same management
[02:03:39.920 --> 02:03:47.040]  technique at the city of london or in israel or in the vatican or in dc uh i mean you know that's
[02:03:47.040 --> 02:03:53.920]  its own district i mean everybody always wants to zero in on jews or catholics or masons or
[02:03:53.920 --> 02:03:59.040]  when really at the top you've got corrupt people that have taken over every major organization
[02:03:59.040 --> 02:04:04.000]  and i've just found it's counterproductive to sit there and say it's the cop's fault or it's
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:08.480]  the black's fault or it's the white's fault or it's the mexican's fault or it's the vatican's fault
[02:04:08.480 --> 02:04:12.960]  i mean i mean i mean taking catholicism i'm not catholic but i've looked at it at being a newsman
[02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:18.080]  there's a hundred different groups in there they're all fighting with each other uh i mean obviously
[02:04:18.080 --> 02:04:23.360]  it's true the vatican helps set up the e u because it wants to run europe so yeah it is a big part of
[02:04:23.360 --> 02:04:27.840]  it uh and i don't defend that at the same time though there are a lot of catholics out fighting
[02:04:27.840 --> 02:04:31.120]  the new world order and fighting abortion who are good people you know i mean i mean it just
[02:04:31.840 --> 02:04:34.880]  i'm gonna hold you over because i want to continue this whole vatican discussion it's
[02:04:34.880 --> 02:04:42.560]  fascinating i should do a whole show like like on jews or on vatican or on masons or on and then
[02:04:42.560 --> 02:04:46.960]  just kind of look at how there's different groups and all these groups and how it's a globalist
[02:04:46.960 --> 02:04:52.080]  philosophy a philosophy of tyranny versus a philosophy of liberty and i'm just here promoting
[02:04:52.080 --> 02:04:58.960]  the philosophy of liberty and i think we can get everybody involved in it

[02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:17.600]  hour start getting in a hurry and start stumbling over my words but how do you counter the ignorance
[02:10:17.600 --> 02:10:23.040]  of the public and and ignorance in government as well versus those of us that are awake i mean
[02:10:23.040 --> 02:10:27.920]  we're not on some high horse saying we're real smart but i can have discussions with billionaires
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:33.520]  corporate people you name it they're so amazed that i know about fractional reserve banking or i
[02:10:33.520 --> 02:10:38.400]  know about basic stuff i mean just in business that can make you so much more successful how
[02:10:38.400 --> 02:10:43.120]  did they ever convince the public that it's dumb to be informed about how the world really works
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:48.880]  and how do you reach out to people that are so stupid and so full of hate they think smashing
[02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:57.120]  up a christmas tree or shooting innocent cops in the head is a moral activity well you uh you
[02:10:57.120 --> 02:11:01.760]  said something there you know that not only are they not informed but they're full of hate and we
[02:11:01.760 --> 02:11:09.120]  see that you know through the tv and the propaganda on the airwaves whether it's through visual or
[02:11:09.120 --> 02:11:14.960]  audio stimulus that they've been able to play on emotional strings of the people and we see
[02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:19.200]  this a lot too you encounter people where you have the proof and the facts and you can show
[02:11:19.200 --> 02:11:23.680]  them to somebody and they will hate you for being the messenger or hate you for telling them the
[02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:30.640]  truth not willing to look at the truth it's it's a process that is and trying to bridge that gap of
[02:11:30.640 --> 02:11:36.000]  helping people understand the information not just showing it to them or giving it to them is
[02:11:36.000 --> 02:11:41.520]  it's a hard it's hard to do these days you know people are set in what they believe and i think
[02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:48.240]  until the public has their own personal experience that opens their their eyes or or leads them to
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:54.480]  search for an answer they're not going to be open to it because they've been so conditioned yeah
[02:11:54.480 --> 02:12:00.240]  conditioned it's conditioning it's probably it's programming it really at the basis of at the at
[02:12:00.240 --> 02:12:05.360]  the root of the level i mean it's it's all my control it really is well i mean if a cop killed
[02:12:05.360 --> 02:12:10.960]  somebody in my family and cold blood and got away with it i would do things legally and other ways of
[02:12:10.960 --> 02:12:15.920]  that you know whatever it took to get justice but it would be against the person that did it not
[02:12:15.920 --> 02:12:23.360]  against some random person in another jurisdiction it gets down to mindless tribalism coke pepsi
[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:28.560]  ford chevy that it's just us against them it's totally sick i want to go back to chris if some
[02:12:28.560 --> 02:12:34.240]  people just joined us chris called in and said hey all roads lead to roam and it doesn't the
[02:12:34.240 --> 02:12:39.840]  vatican run the whole planet from my deep research the vatican is up to its eyeballs
[02:12:40.560 --> 02:12:46.000]  in the new world order in setting up the euro the founding treaty of roam is what it's called
[02:12:46.000 --> 02:12:52.000]  and what in 1957 that really first established the eu the catholic church bishops in the southwest
[02:12:52.000 --> 02:12:58.400]  are pushing for open borders and and it's telling illegals to come in so i think it's seditious but
[02:12:58.400 --> 02:13:04.080]  then other catholic bishops in europe are trying to close the borders i think it's diversified
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:09.040]  and i'm not giving the vatican a pass but i'm not here catholic bashing my point when he said
[02:13:09.040 --> 02:13:14.800]  you know do you think the catholic church runs it all is all people do is fight over who runs
[02:13:14.800 --> 02:13:23.680]  everything is it the is it the um illuminati or is it the masons or is it the jews or is it the
[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:29.920]  rockefellers or is it uh the catholic church and then there's all this endless fighting hey
[02:13:29.920 --> 02:13:37.040]  hey the fellow reserves private it's screwing us over let's get rid of it hey uh i just don't get
[02:13:37.040 --> 02:13:43.520]  caught up it's more divide and conquer i found to get into bashing one group or another isn't
[02:13:43.520 --> 02:13:49.280]  it just corruption at the top that's my take chris what is your take i think there is a lot
[02:13:49.280 --> 02:13:55.520]  of diversity and i do to see a a division in the catholic church and i think a lot of uh higher
[02:13:55.520 --> 02:14:01.440]  uh ranking priests and bishops and cardinals are waking up to the truth and i got to thank you for
[02:14:01.440 --> 02:14:07.120]  leading me back to the truth you led me back to christ and praise god for that and you know when
[02:14:07.120 --> 02:14:12.800]  you look in revelation the great whore the great harlot who rides the top the beast is the catholic
[02:14:12.800 --> 02:14:18.560]  church is the vatican they are at the top of the pyramid right underneath lucifer well sure i think
[02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:24.080]  it's i think it's state-run christian fake i mean here's the issue when i'm everything the catholic
[02:14:24.080 --> 02:14:29.040]  church is doing the protestant churches are doing as well they're pushing for open borders they're
[02:14:29.040 --> 02:14:34.080]  saying turn your guns in they're saying do what the government says that's all i'm saying is when
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:39.440]  we sit there and just single out one church or one organization i think it plays into the larger
[02:14:39.440 --> 02:14:45.680]  divide and conquer go ahead also the new illuminati official website of people have done some
[02:14:45.680 --> 02:14:52.160]  research and tracked it back to the vatican church it was created by a jesuit uh priest i would love
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:57.040]  to hear a whole show on the vatican maybe eric john felps would be a guest i know that here's the
[02:14:57.040 --> 02:15:04.880]  problem here here's my problem okay felps has said things about me that just aren't true and see
[02:15:04.880 --> 02:15:09.840]  that's what i'm saying is that and i appreciate your call is that people make up these faux
[02:15:09.840 --> 02:15:14.320]  controversies that's what i'm saying alex jones works for israel because he doesn't hate jews
[02:15:14.880 --> 02:15:19.600]  and you know then they photoshop you know me at a jewish wedding and stuff i mean it's just
[02:15:19.600 --> 02:15:25.120]  when i have jewish friends it's it's all the infighting that casunstein talks about generating
[02:15:25.120 --> 02:15:31.520]  when he was the regulations are well still is is that it just falls into this mindlessness
[02:15:31.520 --> 02:15:35.520]  where i've been told by people you will come out against the vatican and say it's the devil the
[02:15:35.520 --> 02:15:40.480]  only problem we'll expose you for working for him well i don't work for the vatican so people that
[02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:45.440]  say you know do what we say we're gonna have an inquisition of you it's just another form of tyranny
[02:15:45.440 --> 02:15:50.480]  so that's what i and israel tries to play people off some of the israel lobby and make it all about
[02:15:50.480 --> 02:15:55.440]  the vatican and the vatican under the table does stuff blaming it all on israel well i'm not in an
[02:15:55.440 --> 02:16:02.720]  israel vatican fight i'm not in a black white fight or a black against cop fight i'm here to promote
[02:16:02.720 --> 02:16:07.440]  liberty i'm here to promote freedom i'm here to promote ideas of free market and private property
[02:16:07.440 --> 02:16:12.320]  and freedom of religion where you got freedom and i got freedom as long as you don't infringe on my
[02:16:12.320 --> 02:16:16.880]  freedom or i don't own yours it comes down to that that's what i'm trying to get at uh let's go
[02:16:16.880 --> 02:16:21.040]  ahead and talk to cupcake and maryland then we'll talk to denise ellen or george and others
[02:16:21.040 --> 02:16:27.600]  to see if we have any questions for our guest uh go ahead uh cupcake well hi there doll face how
[02:16:27.600 --> 02:16:35.520]  are you i'm all right all right i've got a question for uh doug and joe go ahead and uh you know you
[02:16:35.520 --> 02:16:44.000]  can uh uh chime in but i've read a series of articles this past week from dave hodges addressing
[02:16:44.000 --> 02:16:53.360]  the emp uh threat and i'm wondering uh how y'all feel about that uh what your sources are telling
[02:16:53.360 --> 02:17:02.960]  you uh how likely that is um and uh and also my second question is have you felt a significant
[02:17:02.960 --> 02:17:07.280]  shift almost a paradigm shift in just the last couple of weeks all right well then i'll give you
[02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:12.080]  my take and then there's i'm worried about a kerrigan event from the sun not so much a foreign
[02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:18.000]  emp attack an emp attack something the globalists might pull guys give us your take yeah i'm with
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:23.760]  you there i've talked to dave hodges a number of times this past week the last 10 days uh about
[02:17:23.760 --> 02:17:31.600]  his articles our viewpoints differ a little bit uh while we see an emp as being a possibility to
[02:17:31.600 --> 02:17:37.120]  take down the grid it's more than likely at least in our view based on what we've researched it would
[02:17:37.120 --> 02:17:43.920]  happen perhaps a later time at a later after things have been um really after after we've been really
[02:17:43.920 --> 02:17:49.760]  rape pillage and robbed uh here in this state so that could come later so that's more of a coup de
[02:17:49.760 --> 02:17:55.360]  gras after they've already sucked us dry the industrialized us had a civil war right barring
[02:17:55.360 --> 02:18:01.840]  of course uh like a kerrigan type of of an event uh because there's much more wealth here to for
[02:18:01.840 --> 02:18:06.800]  them to the globalist to take so they they don't want to destroy us before they take everything
[02:18:06.800 --> 02:18:11.520]  from us that's kind of my viewpoint that's right a spider wants to suck all the juice out before
[02:18:11.520 --> 02:18:18.960]  he cuts the bug loose yeah yeah i agree let's skip this network breaks we get lots of calls and
[02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:23.120]  hearing a right to the bottom the hour of our guests thank you cupcake uh let's talk to uh
[02:18:23.120 --> 02:18:29.840]  denise in femur region five what former state are you calling in from femur region five minnesota
[02:18:29.840 --> 02:18:35.120]  all right well welcome to the airwaves thank you listen i pray for you every day alex thank you
[02:18:35.120 --> 02:18:40.800]  sweetheart for your safety and your family well believe me i need it so thank you don't we all
[02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:48.720]  i mean we all do here's my question i am wondering what's going to happen in 2015
[02:18:48.720 --> 02:18:59.040]  because of the new lawsuit that's coming out against the gun manufacturers in the sandy
[02:18:59.040 --> 02:19:04.480]  hook case because the reason i say yeah that should open up discovery of how fake it is great point
[02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:11.760]  go ahead there's a there was a movie out with gene hackman and john q sec and it was called
[02:19:11.760 --> 02:19:19.440]  runaway jury and it was a great movie and it was about a gunman who went in and shot up an
[02:19:19.440 --> 02:19:26.640]  attorney's office and killed a bunch of the attorneys in the office and what they ended
[02:19:26.640 --> 02:19:32.640]  what the wife of one of the um injured people did was ended up going back and suing the gun
[02:19:32.640 --> 02:19:42.240]  manufacturer and the movie goes into a great amount of of how corrupt our whole judicial system is
[02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:49.280]  and how they paid off jury members and all this kind of stuff and i remember wolfgang helbig said
[02:19:49.280 --> 02:19:55.280]  one of his reasons for questioning sandy hook was nobody was suing none of the parents were soon
[02:19:55.280 --> 02:20:00.480]  a suing like they didn't that is a super question you get the gold star i think the best question
[02:20:00.480 --> 02:20:04.880]  of the day out of a lot of excellent ones uh hagman and hagman give me your take on sandy
[02:20:04.880 --> 02:20:11.360]  hook and what this new lawsuit against bush master means but i'll just try me here first i think
[02:20:11.360 --> 02:20:16.800]  alexander you hit the nail on the head of all of the criminal and civil trials we've been involved in
[02:20:17.360 --> 02:20:23.840]  that a key here is going to be the discovery phase let's see what that brings if it even gets to that
[02:20:23.840 --> 02:20:31.120]  point if it's not uh if the uh if the government doesn't step in or the powers step in to say no
[02:20:31.120 --> 02:20:36.000]  you're not going to go there or they put up they they quash the the entire process but i think it's
[02:20:36.000 --> 02:20:40.720]  i think it's an excellent point the discovery is going to be is going to be key in revealing things
[02:20:40.720 --> 02:20:47.520]  yet unrevealed yeah and sandy hook um i think i'm not sure if it was you or another news agency
[02:20:47.520 --> 02:20:54.720]  that reported the fbi statistics of murders in 2000 well the fbi's on site said none in that
[02:20:54.720 --> 02:21:01.680]  town yeah i mean and uh other examples were shown that that they counted the the massacre in aurora
[02:21:01.680 --> 02:21:07.120]  and those victims in their statistics and and other situations that took place but you know
[02:21:07.120 --> 02:21:12.720]  sandy hook has been a big mystery for me because there's so much i think not only dis info but
[02:21:12.720 --> 02:21:19.360]  planted dis info or you know leading people down certain roads of of seeking that was done intentionally
[02:21:19.360 --> 02:21:24.080]  i think sure what do you guys think of how big i mean he he was a big you know successful famous
[02:21:24.080 --> 02:21:29.600]  uh school safety guy wrote the book on a lot of it all i know is i saw cooper with blue screen out
[02:21:29.600 --> 02:21:35.360]  there green screen uh i know i saw the kids doing fake you know rotations in and out of the building
[02:21:35.360 --> 02:21:40.480]  they tore it down all the unprecedented gag orders you know the police in anti-terror
[02:21:40.480 --> 02:21:45.440]  outfits in the woods then they denied that that'd been in the news i mean something's being hidden
[02:21:45.440 --> 02:21:49.840]  there you guys are on the east coast you have a lot of sources what do you really think happened
[02:21:51.200 --> 02:21:57.040]  well uh alex the what really happened i don't know but i'll tell you what we what we do know
[02:21:57.040 --> 02:22:01.280]  and i can speak for john this and you can speak for himself obviously but what we do know is the
[02:22:01.280 --> 02:22:08.560]  original or the official narrative is not what really happened um i mean look at the heck look at
[02:22:08.560 --> 02:22:14.320]  the behavior of the coroner when he came out that really struck me as as being just the medical
[02:22:14.320 --> 02:22:21.280]  examiner there on scene and you know uh being a blood spatteron analyst myself and uh working
[02:22:21.280 --> 02:22:27.520]  with coroners working with police working with the prosecutors i've never seen anything quite like
[02:22:27.520 --> 02:22:33.280]  that in my life yeah and we talked about computer a computer generated in false news reports i think
[02:22:33.280 --> 02:22:38.320]  this was a pilot possibly and i'm not saying that the event didn't happen or it definitely
[02:22:38.320 --> 02:22:43.120]  didn't happen the way they reported it too but i think this was one of the initial ways that they're
[02:22:43.120 --> 02:22:49.360]  learning how to manipulate news coverage you know very astute but that's what i said a few weeks
[02:22:49.360 --> 02:22:54.880]  into it i said they may have killed real kids but they're practicing how to propagandize and how to
[02:22:54.880 --> 02:23:03.440]  control the press and how to put out a product that's a fraud when i just saw the heavy heavy
[02:23:03.440 --> 02:23:08.880]  scripting that was what was so clear and then the parents laughing and then one second later
[02:23:08.880 --> 02:23:17.120]  doing the actor breathing to cry i mean it just it's just over the top agreed over the top sick
[02:23:17.120 --> 02:23:23.200]  and we know they've staged other stuff before i mean they built fake villages and then didn't
[02:23:23.200 --> 02:23:29.680]  declassify it for about five years for queen elizabeth to visit in africa yeah exactly and
[02:23:29.680 --> 02:23:36.720]  and you know a lot of this elixir i gotta tell you to me and this is a subject for another day of
[02:23:36.720 --> 02:23:44.400]  course but if you look at this satanic ritual sacrifice abuse of these of these psychos in
[02:23:44.400 --> 02:23:50.880]  power and i mean obviously that that's another topic for another time but you know just look
[02:23:50.880 --> 02:23:56.240]  at that as an overlay of what happened well just this week they've had in witchcraft deals two
[02:23:56.240 --> 02:24:00.400]  different dead kids this week and then every time we talk about it they go shut up you know the
[02:24:00.400 --> 02:24:05.680]  occult doesn't kill kids well it has throughout history absolutely so there's also this institutional
[02:24:05.680 --> 02:24:11.920]  cover-up of child abuse not just in the catholic church but across the board absolutely yeah and
[02:24:11.920 --> 02:24:17.520]  and this we have to figure this in as a variable here too these are called high holidays and such
[02:24:17.520 --> 02:24:22.160]  i mean there's just so many aspects to this but that was a great great question indeed i mean
[02:24:22.160 --> 02:24:25.520]  just we had a 10 year old boy mutilated and murdered just this week in a witchcraft ceremony
[02:24:25.520 --> 02:24:30.240]  that was another one i mean this is going on and then every time we raise it we get attacked
[02:24:30.240 --> 02:24:34.240]  i'm just reporting this stuff goes on ladies and gentlemen thank you to these excellent
[02:24:34.240 --> 02:24:40.400]  questions elinor in missouri you're up next go ahead thanks for holding hi thank you elix and
[02:24:40.400 --> 02:24:49.200]  doug and joe headman for being who you are um i just had uh i just had a comment about the
[02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:55.440]  false flags and how they're staged and how they're done so badly these days uh there's a guy by the
[02:24:55.440 --> 02:25:02.240]  name of olie demingard who talks about this and how it's all you know even they even choose certain
[02:25:02.240 --> 02:25:10.240]  colors for certain false flag events to um the propagandize the public and get them uh you know
[02:25:10.240 --> 02:25:17.840]  to you know it's just like what doug and joe headman were saying it's um ritual magic that they use
[02:25:17.840 --> 02:25:25.120]  and then the second thing was that um i've been seeing shortages in the food stores too
[02:25:25.680 --> 02:25:31.040]  what steve quayle was talking about before and i'm just wondering about how these food
[02:25:31.040 --> 02:25:36.320]  riots are like where they're going to come in well there are record food shortages worldwide
[02:25:36.320 --> 02:25:40.320]  and when that happens in a third world country you get mass rioting because you know half the
[02:25:40.320 --> 02:25:45.280]  discretionary income goes to food in most third world countries and america is seeing massive food
[02:25:45.280 --> 02:25:52.720]  uh uh price increases uh headman which one of you wants to take that question yeah look at
[02:25:52.720 --> 02:25:59.120]  venezuela and how the government had to start rationing the uh citizens buying groceries from
[02:25:59.840 --> 02:26:04.640]  stores you know they only certain citizens were allowed to buy i think it was a seven day worth
[02:26:04.640 --> 02:26:09.600]  of food at a time and they're waiting in line for hours i think the you know we saw the huge
[02:26:09.600 --> 02:26:16.400]  drought in california um there is a culling or a a shortening of the herd and and they're thinning
[02:26:16.400 --> 02:26:22.240]  the population through these different you know genetically modified foods for uh from that to
[02:26:22.240 --> 02:26:25.840]  taking the nutrients and the important minerals out of the food and as you said everything we've
[02:26:25.840 --> 02:26:31.840]  seen so far is only beta testing that's right but you can see it all lining up globally towards the
[02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:38.160]  next big phase that's what we've got to basically discredit sabotage and expose peacefully as much
[02:26:38.160 --> 02:26:42.640]  as their operation as we can because what it can't survive is exposure in my experience
[02:26:43.280 --> 02:26:47.680]  yeah exactly and i think what we're seeing here with the food shortages today the ground beef at
[02:26:47.680 --> 02:26:54.320]  420 of a pound uh highest on record i think in this particular case in certain cases here i think
[02:26:54.320 --> 02:27:02.160]  what we're seeing are the birth panings of a larger uh economic and uh uh food supply disruption
[02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:07.840]  that uh you know that will happen that that's my absolutely thank you elinor uh and again here
[02:27:07.840 --> 02:27:12.080]  we're so spoiled on average it's not as big a deal but in third world it's life and death
[02:27:12.080 --> 02:27:17.040]  but but ground beef being at record prices or beef poultry at record prices across the board
[02:27:17.040 --> 02:27:22.080]  is a microcosm of everything record amounts of ranchers are going out of business because of
[02:27:22.080 --> 02:27:27.680]  regulations and fines and control the the big three meat packers shut down all the small operators
[02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:33.040]  with federal regulations the last 20 years there are no real stockyards anymore that have real
[02:27:33.040 --> 02:27:39.280]  auctions they still have them but it's only a few major bidders there so record beef prices
[02:27:39.280 --> 02:27:44.880]  but the beef producers are going out of business that shows how a rigged crony capitalist system
[02:27:44.880 --> 02:27:50.400]  is one of the worst you can live under the opposite of a free market it's economic tyranny
[02:27:50.400 --> 02:27:56.000]  it's it's slavery at its finest or at its best or worst whatever you want to call it gentlemen
[02:27:56.000 --> 02:28:01.280]  we're out of time we got george in connecticut robert dan d i'll get to them coming up after
[02:28:01.280 --> 02:28:05.920]  you're gone but you got about a minute and a half for any other key intel you want to put out there
[02:28:05.920 --> 02:28:11.520]  for folks i'll take 30 seconds of that i'll tell you what um alex what we've been looking at here
[02:28:11.520 --> 02:28:17.440]  very closely is uh watch syria watch the middle east watch the geopolitics of the middle east
[02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:22.000]  watch the small arms trade treaty here in this country obviously you've covered that uh or how
[02:28:22.000 --> 02:28:29.280]  it will affect the massive demonstration uh the key thing here over everything that we're looking at
[02:28:29.280 --> 02:28:35.280]  is the killing off of the u.s dollar that's the ultimate goal the balkanization of america
[02:28:35.280 --> 02:28:42.160]  falling behind it through the uh massive illegal immigration and the blanket amnesty yeah and i
[02:28:42.160 --> 02:28:47.760]  believe that you know this 2015 coming up as i stated earlier as as read from so many of the
[02:28:47.760 --> 02:28:53.600]  the mainstream news sites that they're 2015 will be the you know the year of the hacking the cyber
[02:28:53.600 --> 02:28:58.400]  insecurity as they call it i would definitely keep my eyes on that and how that plays into
[02:28:58.400 --> 02:29:04.960]  their objectives um as you pointed out we are slaves under an economic and uh tyrannical political
[02:29:05.840 --> 02:29:11.280]  authoritarian type system and just look for them to keep continue to push buttons and try to pull
[02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:17.680]  strings of the hearts of the american people to shape the agenda and shape the world events in
[02:29:17.680 --> 02:29:22.400]  the way they want them for the reactions that they want and we have to take a step back every
[02:29:22.400 --> 02:29:26.960]  time we see something big happen we have to take a step back and analyze it before we start trying
[02:29:26.960 --> 02:29:31.920]  to jump to conclusions or fitting pieces exactly and that's what i'm going to cover next obama
[02:29:31.920 --> 02:29:37.040]  creates the truth of it on his own agenda lou rockwell dot com asked why i'm going to break

[02:37:54.560 --> 02:38:00.080]  on news events and make them public this is the story at lou rockwell dot com upon info
[02:38:00.080 --> 02:38:05.200]  wars dot com why does obama come up with such quick judgments on news events and make them public
[02:38:05.760 --> 02:38:11.040]  whether it's the downing of mh-17 the use of chemical weapons in syria the death of michael
[02:38:11.040 --> 02:38:17.760]  brown or the hacking of sony obama hastily tells everyone what happened even though he
[02:38:17.760 --> 02:38:22.960]  cannot possibly know what has happened why does he do this in each case he clearly has an agenda
[02:38:22.960 --> 02:38:30.240]  that he wishes to promote he has his arterial motives ulterior he wants to use the events to
[02:38:30.240 --> 02:38:34.320]  advance his political agenda and then the article goes through it it's a good little short article
[02:38:35.040 --> 02:38:39.360]  and i know this is simple to most people but for folks not paying attention it just becomes
[02:38:39.360 --> 02:38:45.440]  reality the president tells you global warming's real and it's man-made it's true the president
[02:38:45.440 --> 02:38:49.440]  tells you you didn't build your business it's true the president tells the black lady he's
[02:38:49.440 --> 02:38:55.360]  going to get her house even though he doesn't it's true the obama says it's basically racist you
[02:38:55.360 --> 02:39:02.800]  know police it must be true this is the propaganda system we know the russian shot down this plane
[02:39:02.800 --> 02:39:08.880]  with no proof day one how suspicious is that i was like well it might be the russians but i'll
[02:39:08.880 --> 02:39:16.320]  sure tell you that they don't have a motive that's what this comes down to and when this
[02:39:16.320 --> 02:39:21.440]  sony thing broke two and a half weeks ago i said yeah probably a false flag to promote the movie
[02:39:21.440 --> 02:39:26.480]  they'll say they're not going to release it then they will they just bypass the theaters to a pure
[02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:32.800]  profit margin of 1499 and reportedly had hundreds of thousands of downloads the first day i don't
[02:39:32.800 --> 02:39:36.640]  know what it is now it's going to end up being hugely profitable they project even though it
[02:39:36.640 --> 02:39:43.440]  has one of the worst ratings ever recorded for a major movie on major platforms imdb you name it
[02:39:43.440 --> 02:39:49.520]  now we're going to go to john let's turn his mic on uh john bound here was up here working today
[02:39:49.520 --> 02:39:53.360]  getting some video clips together he's seen the whole movie i said instead of me playing a few
[02:39:53.360 --> 02:39:58.560]  clips you've seen it investigative journalist john bound puts a lot of the video reports you see
[02:39:58.560 --> 02:40:05.200]  i said come on in and tell us your take on it uh but now it's come out that the fbi said day one
[02:40:05.200 --> 02:40:12.080]  looks like an inside job and that it was a hack attack out of japan at least bouncing the hacks off
[02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:18.480]  that through computers there and not north korea who were not defending we just go with the truth
[02:40:18.480 --> 02:40:23.440]  so it's they get to burn people in hollywood they don't like make cloney look like an angel
[02:40:23.440 --> 02:40:28.320]  obama gets to defend the first amendment and then stand up against censorship when he's doing the
[02:40:28.320 --> 02:40:34.240]  opposite in the real world there's a lot of motives here but talking about it the film itself john
[02:40:34.240 --> 02:40:40.160]  bound has now seen it we have some clips we're going to play john bound you have the control tower
[02:40:40.800 --> 02:40:48.240]  give us your review well uh you mentioned sony uh the hack in sony was uh it revealed that
[02:40:48.800 --> 02:40:55.440]  sony was well aware that this movie was going to be a total bomb so what better way to do it than
[02:40:55.440 --> 02:41:01.440]  to have the president of the united states come out and you know before he goes on his 14 day 17
[02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:07.120]  day vacation in hawaii to make himself look good to say hey i'm standing up for the first amendment
[02:41:07.120 --> 02:41:12.800]  well the reason this movie is so painful to watch is because it doesn't feel good to you
[02:41:12.800 --> 02:41:17.680]  from the beginning there's so much wrapped around it and a lot of the stuff that's the
[02:41:17.680 --> 02:41:25.200]  onion of this movie involves the interior attack of the chinese on our hollywood media system
[02:41:25.200 --> 02:41:33.120]  uh what is this name uh wang wang glyn a billionaire uh chinese businessman owns amc
[02:41:33.840 --> 02:41:38.560]  uh which is the second largest chain here in the end they were the ones that told them don't
[02:41:38.560 --> 02:41:43.280]  release red dawn till a year later to take the chinese out yeah so this is the there's the real
[02:41:43.280 --> 02:41:49.920]  issue yeah this is the next step in their propaganda we and as you well know china and uh russia
[02:41:49.920 --> 02:41:55.840]  were very you're saying in the film they throw it in their face china runs us uh well in the beginning
[02:41:55.840 --> 02:42:01.760]  of the film uh in this first clip uh called i called it the mission uh they they take seth
[02:42:01.760 --> 02:42:07.040]  rogan who wrote and directed uh co-directed the film and they take him to a rural part of china
[02:42:07.040 --> 02:42:12.640]  to give him his mission for north korea which another part about north korea and china that
[02:42:12.640 --> 02:42:18.240]  no one's seeing is that north korea is basically china's little brother that they hand billions
[02:42:18.240 --> 02:42:23.520]  of dollars of aid to every year and they border them biggest ally they border them and they hate
[02:42:23.520 --> 02:42:30.880]  japan so uh you know north korea is as close to japan as you're going to get and uh so in this
[02:42:30.880 --> 02:42:39.040]  first clip the mission we get an idea of where uh seth rogan the writer and creator and james
[02:42:39.040 --> 02:42:45.840]  franko or flocko is uh obama called him i wonder if that was staged right there but uh you get an
[02:42:45.840 --> 02:42:52.160]  idea of uh what the mission is how clueless they are and how much of a part of the hollywood system
[02:42:52.160 --> 02:42:56.560]  they are and uh what they're getting themselves let's go to that clip from the interview
[02:43:01.920 --> 02:43:07.200]  our beloved leader is why sounds like a kid singing for about obama
[02:43:07.200 --> 02:43:15.920]  so she's saying uh the one thing we wish for us for the united states to explode in a
[02:43:17.200 --> 02:43:21.280]  ball of hell fire that's actually what they say tharvin begon be ravaged by disease
[02:43:22.400 --> 02:43:30.480]  may they be helpless poor sad and cold they're arrogant and fat they're stupid and they're evil
[02:43:30.480 --> 02:43:36.720]  well our our leader like your your leader may they drown in their own die america die
[02:43:38.640 --> 02:43:43.200]  oh please won't you die it would fill my tiny little heart with joy
[02:43:45.040 --> 02:43:51.760]  may your women all be raped by beasts of the jungle while your children are forced to watch
[02:43:51.760 --> 02:43:59.680]  you and then they sit on a missile it's pretty accurate so far
[02:44:01.360 --> 02:44:05.520]  we now turn to the hostile nation of northeastern except their missile will blow up although kim
[02:44:05.520 --> 02:44:11.360]  jung un rallies his people with the message here to the united states of america james franko
[02:44:11.360 --> 02:44:16.960]  was playing a leading american entertainment his favorite show reporter entertainer the
[02:44:16.960 --> 02:44:23.760]  interviewer and uh kim jung is a huge fan of his just like he was a dentist wrong so
[02:44:24.400 --> 02:44:29.520]  he's gonna have him come there and do the interview and now they're in rural china mr
[02:44:29.520 --> 02:44:36.320]  rapper pot i am soup yong pa the supreme leader will grant a one-hour interview to mr skylock
[02:44:36.320 --> 02:44:40.720]  from inside north korea all questions will be supplied by the supreme leader himself
[02:44:40.720 --> 02:44:47.760]  times are not negotiable you have 24 hours to decide that's it yeah why don't you guys tell me
[02:44:47.760 --> 02:44:53.680]  this over the phone or sky do you guys have skype do you have skype here you too lucky gentleman
[02:44:53.680 --> 02:44:58.160]  notice the internet doesn't even work over there but they have congratulations by the way the internet
[02:44:58.160 --> 02:45:03.440]  doesn't work part of the reason they're like 12 computers the cia would love it if you two could
[02:45:04.320 --> 02:45:09.520]  take him out now solve how the ci is cute well well now the ci is coming in through the back
[02:45:09.520 --> 02:45:15.200]  with a hot check take him out like for drinks no no no take him out take out like to dinner
[02:45:15.200 --> 02:45:21.200]  take him out to a meal take him out she can't say it exactly she's no uh it's time to say it
[02:45:22.160 --> 02:45:32.160]  take him out assassinate you want us to assassinate the leader of north korea yes as if the cia wants
[02:45:32.160 --> 02:45:36.880]  to actually get rid of him i mean they love it right right and they're all working together uh
[02:45:36.880 --> 02:45:41.600]  you know through kissinger basically is making is behind the scenes went through china a little
[02:45:41.600 --> 02:45:49.120]  puppet master back there so now we we move on to the meeting of mr skylark and kim jung and what
[02:45:49.120 --> 02:45:53.760]  leads up to that so let's go ahead and roll that well and of course this makes kim jung look like
[02:45:53.760 --> 02:45:58.000]  he's actually kind of tough and stuff when when he's a total piece of garbage and can't even hardly
[02:45:58.000 --> 02:46:08.400]  walk he's such a sack of bullying scum filled evil let's let's go ahead and go to that hello north
[02:46:08.400 --> 02:46:15.760]  korea you know i'm very very interested in the history of your young nation now he's bringing up the
[02:46:15.760 --> 02:46:22.080]  fact that absolutely everyone here is the people of north korea let's hear that it's so quite all
[02:46:22.080 --> 02:46:30.400]  right this is a common misconception oh okay see for yourself look at that fat kid hi little fatty
[02:46:30.400 --> 02:46:38.720]  boy we have many fat children in north korea the supreme leader believes it is a hallmark of a
[02:46:38.720 --> 02:46:48.880]  prosperity and a self-sufficiency i don't know if skylark ah it's crazy oh i have a gift for you
[02:46:48.880 --> 02:46:59.680]  oh really oh oh this is me for you oh that's great i always wanted one of these a a bust
[02:46:59.680 --> 02:47:07.200]  babe skylark hey thank you so you really like the show you know i might not show it but i'm freaking
[02:47:07.200 --> 02:47:15.040]  out you're like a super fan hi really yeah hey you want to see something cool yeah so now he goes
[02:47:15.040 --> 02:47:23.120]  in cars just like kim jong's father who was they had a special sauna set up so they could get over
[02:47:23.120 --> 02:47:27.840]  their hangovers from the party and all night long still you had a seven-story pleasure palace and they
[02:47:27.840 --> 02:47:33.680]  would kidnap asian film stars and bring them there too later let's go back to the film oh you know my
[02:47:33.680 --> 02:47:38.880]  wife must have put that in there because i've never heard this before in my life i love katie berry
[02:47:38.880 --> 02:47:44.160]  baby you're a fire and again we're analyzing this propaganda put out on the internet flooding
[02:47:44.160 --> 02:47:49.200]  internet right now you were as they capitalize with american people i was in this all the time really
[02:47:49.200 --> 02:47:55.760]  i love her no i really like her because because she has such a strong message for young women
[02:47:55.760 --> 02:48:03.920]  and girls across the planet she's a it's a so empowering yeah you know dave sometimes i feel
[02:48:03.920 --> 02:48:10.480]  like a plastic bag this is really sick how it's humanizing kim jong on it's softening him for
[02:48:10.480 --> 02:48:15.200]  the masses in united states it's making a dictator a guy that kills people that are very close to
[02:48:15.200 --> 02:48:20.880]  this movie really is filthy what was it like for you to watch the whole thing well it it makes me
[02:48:20.880 --> 02:48:27.440]  sick to know that the american media is pushing yet again more evil onto our citizens our children
[02:48:28.560 --> 02:48:33.360]  turning a dictator into somebody that could actually be humanized you know you have these
[02:48:33.360 --> 02:48:37.280]  scenes where they and now they're getting together they're getting to know one another
[02:48:37.280 --> 02:48:42.720]  and mr skylark is seeing his side of things dying wish you know let's hear this scum his torch
[02:48:43.920 --> 02:48:48.160]  oh that's the end of that one but yeah let's go to uh the final clip here this is kim jong
[02:48:48.160 --> 02:48:53.360]  undies as we analyze this state-run media propaganda the president is involved in this
[02:48:53.360 --> 02:49:08.560]  false flag run by sony here it is so they take him out is with a tank shoe no yeah yeah he was
[02:49:08.560 --> 02:49:18.560]  about to nuke us as if he could and skylark has discovered that he has uh not been feeding his
[02:49:18.560 --> 02:49:23.760]  people he's asked him in the interview and he made a fool of himself in the interview in front
[02:49:23.760 --> 02:49:28.400]  of his people kim jong undies so they're and they're calling a revolution they come back they're
[02:49:28.400 --> 02:49:36.160]  the heroes of democracy and yet it's a giant cia syop to the america well you've seen the whole
[02:49:36.160 --> 02:49:42.000]  film i mean does it glorify freedom and and private property or is it glorify uh government
[02:49:42.000 --> 02:49:49.040]  welfare feed your people it really uh there's a lot of subconscious layers but what it really glorifies
[02:49:49.040 --> 02:49:56.000]  and quintessentially goes after is is softening the mind and perception of the american people of
[02:49:56.000 --> 02:50:01.840]  the rest of the world for dick dictatorship you know as we have cuba and now and in north korea
[02:50:01.840 --> 02:50:06.880]  we're putting these dictators on a pedestal and we're probably the next movie to come out will be
[02:50:06.880 --> 02:50:12.240]  about you know the dictators dictatorship of cuba so well you know kim jong und who is obsessed
[02:50:12.240 --> 02:50:18.000]  with hollywood must love this big controversy in a movie about him oh yeah i'm sure he loves this movie
[02:50:18.000 --> 02:50:24.000]  yeah i'm sure he really enjoys this movie even though it shows him crying whatnot but uh you
[02:50:24.000 --> 02:50:29.120]  know it it it turns it it does humanize him but then in the background the whole thing's a scam
[02:50:29.920 --> 02:50:36.000]  for a dud of a movie to get a bunch of hype driven people to go out and watch it and to get the right
[02:50:36.000 --> 02:50:39.840]  wing to go out and watch it saying it's their patriotic duty to watch it so that they won't
[02:50:39.840 --> 02:50:44.240]  put up with censorship they're now agreeing with obama who came out to defend the first
[02:50:44.240 --> 02:50:48.320]  amendment when he normally attacks us your patriotic duty not to watch it all right folks
[02:50:48.320 --> 02:50:54.720]  there's some clips uh of this for the purpose of review and analysis of this fraud on the people

[02:55:32.240 --> 02:55:36.560]  it the guy that wants our guns and it's and they're gonna do it to us after they're done with russia
[02:55:36.560 --> 02:55:40.800]  it's sick you're right on target that's exactly what i was going to say they're basically being
[02:55:40.800 --> 02:55:44.400]  the prototype to see if we're going to do something about it and this nation better start
[02:55:44.400 --> 02:55:50.160]  repenting and i mean really repenting in a religious way otherwise it's coming upon us too
[02:55:50.160 --> 02:55:55.120]  about gloating over this won't help but i think we should all set go to go to the the stores where
[02:55:55.120 --> 02:56:02.880]  they have a discount cards for christmas and said mr soros a nice card saying we know what

[02:56:08.240 --> 02:56:21.920]  he lives at 136 tatto tatito c-a-n-t-i-t-o-e street at katona new york zip one zero five three six
[02:56:21.920 --> 02:56:25.920]  well listen here's the deal i don't want to get into the whole thing with george soros he bragged
[02:56:25.920 --> 02:56:30.480]  that he was behind the ukraine thing he's just completely out of his mind nazi collaborator
[02:56:30.480 --> 02:56:36.880]  gets away with it i just but he's only one big problem in all of this but i just pray for peace
[02:56:36.880 --> 02:56:42.400]  and and the globalists are waging war against all of our nations it's it's it's evil thank you george
[02:56:43.200 --> 02:56:48.080]  let's go ahead and take another call here dan in arizona you're on the air welcome
[02:56:48.080 --> 02:56:54.320]  hey there hey i hope you guys all had a uh a good christmas hope you did as well brother
[02:56:55.360 --> 02:57:00.240]  so i wanted to tell you right off the bat listen to you for i think eight or nine years i love you
[02:57:00.240 --> 02:57:06.720]  buddy you've definitely changed my life since i started listening to you gotta say though um
[02:57:06.720 --> 02:57:11.280]  you'd mentioned earlier with that vatican call about doing an episode on them and all the other
[02:57:11.280 --> 02:57:18.480]  groups i definitely think you should do it that would be a great idea because uh i don't like i
[02:57:18.480 --> 02:57:22.480]  don't like how the answer was or how the question was answered i think it needs to be looked at a
[02:57:22.480 --> 02:57:27.120]  little bit more we know they have some well look i know it'll get ratings to sit there and talk about
[02:57:27.120 --> 02:57:32.160]  the masons and this and that and it's just i'm trying to promote basic private property freedom
[02:57:32.160 --> 02:57:38.080]  the right to self-defense sovereignty so much the liberty movement because it gets listeners up front
[02:57:38.080 --> 02:57:44.240]  but over time everybody tunes out and it doesn't help anybody just blaming groups all day obviously
[02:57:44.240 --> 02:57:48.640]  the vatican's fascinating and i threw out everything on the vatican another caller if
[02:57:48.640 --> 02:57:54.480]  there wants to talk about it um about the vatican involved in the e you behind that the vatican
[02:57:54.480 --> 02:58:01.440]  involved with the open borders i mean what what how did you not like the way i answered it um
[02:58:02.160 --> 02:58:06.480]  i think just when it gets brought up it well here let's let's kind of look at it like
[02:58:06.480 --> 02:58:12.160]  when we talk about obama his name gets thrown into this show every single day but we all know he's
[02:58:12.160 --> 02:58:17.680]  not the guy at the top he's a player in it but we we know he's not the one making these decisions
[02:58:17.680 --> 02:58:22.480]  for the most part but we still throw his name out there every time it's just like the vatican
[02:58:22.480 --> 02:58:26.720]  they're not the be all end all but they do play a role and i think it should be looked at more
[02:58:26.720 --> 02:58:31.760]  sure i mean i think the vatican's power is declined actually and i think it's it's that's why you see
[02:58:31.760 --> 02:58:37.280]  the media attacking it all the time doesn't mean it's good you know overall good though hold on i
[02:58:37.280 --> 02:58:41.440]  gotta go to another vatican question so i gotta let you go overdrive coming up see you this sunday

[03:00:44.960 --> 03:00:50.000]  quick because i want to jam in d and a few others uh go ahead you're on the air uh hey alex i just
[03:00:50.000 --> 03:00:55.120]  wanted to say this about that every institution that you look at whether it's the u.s. government
[03:00:55.120 --> 03:01:00.720]  the throne of britain the vatican they're all occupied by the same evil forces and so you
[03:01:00.720 --> 03:01:05.040]  know you can fixate on one but then you're going to miss out on the other six that you're not looking
[03:01:05.040 --> 03:01:10.720]  at if you get too fixated on the vatican which is totally went downward as far as its doctrines and
[03:01:10.720 --> 03:01:15.520]  everything else then you're going to miss the uh the basically the jewish wing of the mafia the
[03:01:15.520 --> 03:01:22.240]  free masonic the otl the queen of britain these sickos over on that throne in britain my gosh they
[03:01:22.240 --> 03:01:27.200]  keep they go around and well exactly children exactly just because there's evil sickos over
[03:01:27.200 --> 03:01:31.840]  england doesn't mean that british themselves are bad people just because there's a jewish mafia
[03:01:31.840 --> 03:01:36.240]  that basically goes around and gets protection money from all the major successful jews doesn't
[03:01:36.240 --> 03:01:40.160]  mean jews are bad just because the catholic church is new world order you know at the top doesn't
[03:01:40.160 --> 03:01:46.160]  mean catholics are bad people we need to fight corruption and and and systems of evil like your
[03:01:46.160 --> 03:01:50.560]  kids belong to the state or we're going to get your guns instead of fighting all day about
[03:01:50.560 --> 03:01:57.840]  who the biggest hat on the hydra is yeah well the whole thing the whole thing is it's one big massive
[03:01:57.840 --> 03:02:03.440]  thing that infects every institution it can get its hands on jesus said the devil's kingdom is not
[03:02:03.440 --> 03:02:08.480]  divided against itself they have skirmishes in between each other but the thing is they're all
[03:02:08.480 --> 03:02:13.840]  divided i mean they're all united at this one agenda which is why do you think cuba is going to get
[03:02:13.840 --> 03:02:17.600]  normalized its relations with the united states guess what because they're going to get absorbed
[03:02:17.600 --> 03:02:21.840]  into this north american union that's right they're now ready to line it all up they try to take over
[03:02:21.840 --> 03:02:27.440]  using communism that didn't work so now they're using this globalism great call robert is exactly
[03:02:27.440 --> 03:02:36.080]  where i'm at i mean it's just cheap and easy to say mason's jews vatican you know uh other groups
[03:02:36.080 --> 03:02:43.440]  it's just so simple there's an illuminati formula that is being used to take over everything
[03:02:45.120 --> 03:02:50.160]  and these things have been taken over you can't debate it uh d in texas go ahead
[03:02:51.520 --> 03:02:58.720]  yeah i'm i'm a long time listener and i said a couple points to make like i have to agree with
[03:02:58.720 --> 03:03:04.880]  you people focusing on these groups it's irrelevant these power groups are irrelevant
[03:03:04.880 --> 03:03:10.320]  they have to be stopped either way their agenda has to be stopped we have to stop the globalist
[03:03:10.320 --> 03:03:15.280]  new world order uh foreign mega banks creating their own governmental systems that circumvent
[03:03:15.280 --> 03:03:21.360]  our government i mean that checkmates them right there exactly and like focusing on them is exactly
[03:03:21.360 --> 03:03:27.440]  what they want they want us to think that they're all splinter factions but they're not and you know
[03:03:27.440 --> 03:03:34.400]  i just wanted to mention the uh so-called sony hacks and how convenient it is that all of a sudden
[03:03:34.400 --> 03:03:43.200]  both you know microsoft and uh playstation network went down right after they supposedly got hacked
[03:03:43.200 --> 03:03:48.640]  and now they're introducing these internet censorship bills and whatnot it's just way too
[03:03:48.640 --> 03:03:54.240]  convenient and all the people that think that this is you know some sort of shadowy group
[03:03:54.880 --> 03:03:59.920]  i think they're the wool has been pulled over exactly a great call it's targeting people that
[03:03:59.920 --> 03:04:04.080]  aren't paying attention they're rolling out the internet censorship next month it's a few days
