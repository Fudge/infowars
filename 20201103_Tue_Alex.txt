[00:00.000 --> 00:28.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, the moment of truth is now upon us.
[00:28.000 --> 00:35.000]  We are going headlong into the future, Tuesday, November 3rd, zero hour.
[00:35.000 --> 00:40.000]  Zero days until the most historic election in world history.
[00:40.000 --> 00:45.000]  A referendum between globalism and Americanism.
[00:45.000 --> 00:50.000]  Here is Joe Biden's chief advisor on PBS admitting what we already knew.
[00:50.000 --> 00:59.000]  Their strategy was to hide this individual in the basement until he could get into office and replace it with Kamala Harris.
[00:59.000 --> 01:08.000]  We are confident in our strategy. I remember not a couple of weeks or maybe months ago when folks suggested that we should get out of the basement.
[01:08.000 --> 01:15.000]  Our strategy has worked, Judy. We are talking directly to the American people and we look forward to continuing to do that through tomorrow.
[01:15.000 --> 01:23.000]  We know at some of these, President Trump's rallies, thousands are showing up in terms of numbers and that is why I ask you that question.
[01:23.000 --> 01:31.000]  Now, Tucker Carlson is always powerful, but he laid it out so beautifully, so perfectly last night.
[01:31.000 --> 01:42.000]  We come back, I am going to play five minutes of it, where he explains that this is a referendum between nationalism and populism and our disgusting ruling class that doesn't even believe America should exist.
[01:42.000 --> 01:54.000]  See, to carry out these evil things, the destruction of America, to parlay our power and our money and our ingenuity into building world government while demoralizing us, while dumbing us down, while breaking up our families,
[01:54.000 --> 01:59.000]  to make sure that we would fall, you have to really hate people you are doing that to.
[01:59.000 --> 02:10.000]  And because we stood down because we were naive, because we slept on our laurels, the most evil corrupt elites the planet has ever seen got control of this nation.
[02:10.000 --> 02:18.000]  They're the same ones that put mouse and tongue in power in 1949, and David Rockefeller wrote two op-eds of the New York Times bragging about it.
[02:18.000 --> 02:24.000]  And we really are living in Rockefeller's world. His foundation is behind Belomel and the Gates Foundation.
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  John D. Rockefeller the first, right down to David.
[02:29.000 --> 02:34.000]  And this is a revolution we're involved in against them.
[02:34.000 --> 02:40.000]  And there are minions like Hillary Clinton.
[02:40.000 --> 02:46.000]  Remember, they had a quarter million of these already printed up, already on newsstands the day of the election.
[02:46.000 --> 02:51.000]  Madam President, already in the airports that morning when she lost.
[02:51.000 --> 02:54.000]  They are so butthurt that they're not invincible and godlike.
[02:54.000 --> 02:59.000]  So now they've engaged even bigger fraud to try to fix the system and they're able to steal it from Trump.
[02:59.000 --> 03:01.000]  It'll blow up in their face even bigger.
[03:01.000 --> 03:04.000]  They've got a plan A and they've got a plan B.
[03:04.000 --> 03:10.000]  But these menus of the globalists have been raping this country since 1993 when they accelerated to sell out to communist China.
[03:10.000 --> 03:13.000]  So that's what this election is all about.
[03:13.000 --> 03:20.000]  So if you want to fight these people, they are going to pull some major shenanigans.
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  We know exactly what they're up to.
[03:23.000 --> 03:27.000]  I pay more attention to their political operations than even high level Democrats do.
[03:27.000 --> 03:31.000]  Because they're all a bunch of lazy, meth head devil, worse for pedophile trash.
[03:31.000 --> 03:33.000]  They all work the minimum amount.
[03:33.000 --> 03:39.000]  But they have all the money, all the power because their father is the devil and he's the god of this world for a short time.
[03:39.000 --> 03:44.000]  The devil sends the beast with wrath because he knows the time is short.
[03:44.000 --> 03:48.000]  And I've studied every facet of what they're going to do and we know exactly what they're going to do.
[03:48.000 --> 03:51.000]  We know exactly what they're going to pull and exactly how they're going to do it.
[03:51.000 --> 03:58.000]  The good news is I've been watching the White House very closely. They've gotten dialed into what's happening that they don't even really need me anymore.
[03:58.000 --> 04:06.000]  They used to need this show and need you to tell them now they're so dialed in and know how things work that if Trump gets back in and can make it over these hurdles,
[04:06.000 --> 04:09.000]  he is going to destroy the globalist.
[04:09.000 --> 04:11.000]  Absolutely destroy them.
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  And that's why they're so incredibly dangerous right now.
[04:16.000 --> 04:27.000]  So I'm going to walk through the scenarios that we face. Plan A, Plan B and Plan C of these dirtbags and why they're going to pull it.
[04:27.000 --> 04:30.000]  Because they've never gotten in trouble.
[04:30.000 --> 04:35.000]  And so it's like letting somebody rob, rape and murder, which is what they're doing.
[04:35.000 --> 04:41.000]  And they get to get out of jail free card and if they're a psychotic person, they're going to keep doing it.
[04:41.000 --> 04:50.000]  But see, when they don't get in trouble, they always escalate, escalate. And if they make the move and actually try to bite this off, there's no way they can chew it.
[04:50.000 --> 04:58.000]  We're talking about a midget trying to eat an elephant in one bite. So the sick part of me hopes they actually try it.
[04:58.000 --> 05:05.000]  The miraculous properties of turmeric have been admired and even worshiped for thousands of years by ancient civilizations.
[05:05.000 --> 05:13.000]  With modern science, we know why turmeric is so popular. It's antioxidant effect. It's anti-inflammatory effect.
[05:13.000 --> 05:19.000]  Everything it does is simply amazing. And most turmerics out there are simply food products.
[05:19.000 --> 05:30.000]  They're 3 to 5% curcuminoid. But we have body's ultimate turmeric formula with a 95% curcuminoid level.
[05:30.000 --> 05:35.000]  And we have other organic products in there that accelerate it and bring it into the cells of the body.
[05:35.000 --> 05:48.000]  It's been sold out for months. It's back in stock. And despite that, body's ultimate turmeric formula at infowarstore.com is 50% off with pre-shipping and triple-patriot points at infowarstore.com.
[05:48.000 --> 05:56.000]  It's body's ultimate turmeric formula. If you haven't tried it, learn why it's got thousands of 5 star reviews at infowarstore.com.
[05:56.000 --> 06:00.000]  And you can't lose. It funds the infowar.
[06:13.000 --> 06:21.000]  We are now zero hour. Zero hour. Zero hour. Zero hour.
[06:21.000 --> 06:26.000]  That means the collision is now. Election 2020.
[06:26.000 --> 06:32.000]  More people voted by last week and voted the last general election. Massive voting across the country.
[06:32.000 --> 06:38.000]  The deep state is in absolute total panic mode and there is clear rock hard evidence.
[06:38.000 --> 06:50.000]  A systemic election fraud and voter fraud in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, in Ohio, in Iowa, in Georgia, in North Carolina, in Florida.
[06:50.000 --> 06:56.000]  It's pouring in confirmation. Massive criminal activity.
[06:56.000 --> 07:03.000]  We're covering it all at the bottom of the hour. Let me tell you who we've got today. Jim Hoft of the Gateway Pundit.
[07:03.000 --> 07:08.000]  Roger Stone, former chief campaign advisor to President Trump, political advisor.
[07:08.000 --> 07:22.000]  Hotep Jesus. David Ike. David Knight. Paul Joseph Watson. That's just in the next three hours and 55 minutes of my transmission.
[07:22.000 --> 07:34.000]  That I'm going to be back throughout the entire day with Leanne McAdoo and with Deanna Lorraine and with Owen Shroyer and with Harrison Smith and with Rob Dew and with all the rest of our amazing crew.
[07:34.000 --> 07:39.000]  We've got some big guests coming up tonight and surprise guest and a lot of surprise stuff going on.
[07:39.000 --> 07:44.000]  You know, I don't tell you big stuff's coming if it isn't coming. Obviously big stuff's coming. We're now here.
[07:44.000 --> 07:51.000]  The clash of civilizations, tyranny and the globalist system versus America.
[07:51.000 --> 08:03.000]  The world that John D. Rockefeller with the remnants of the British Empire with Cecil Rhodes built and his grandson David Rockefeller.
[08:03.000 --> 08:08.000]  David just died a few years ago and they built the UN. They put Mao in charge.
[08:08.000 --> 08:15.000]  They ran the Communist Party in Russia. They financed Hitler. This is all in Pulitzer Prize winning books.
[08:15.000 --> 08:20.000]  They don't even hide this stuff. They congressional hearings about it in the 70s and the church committee.
[08:20.000 --> 08:27.000]  Anthony Sutton got all the secret government documents out of the Carnegie and Ford and Rockefeller Foundation that Congress had access to with classification.
[08:27.000 --> 08:38.000]  That's how I know their plan. We aren't one of those other shows that talks about Republican or Democrat and all these little ideologies that are just side issues to the world government new world order system.
[08:38.000 --> 08:46.000]  And what its plan is for you and your family and it ain't good. You see that with the Rockefeller Foundation lockstep that totally predicts 10 years ago,
[08:46.000 --> 08:50.000]  but we're currently under with the global martial law.
[08:50.000 --> 09:00.000]  For TV viewers, let's put the photo up of one town in Pennsylvania alone. Trump's done more than 20 rallies in Pennsylvania and that's just a close shot.
[09:00.000 --> 09:19.000]  There is video that Tucker Carlson shows and he backs out of it and the crowd goes on and on and on over 100,000 people and reportedly 50,000 couldn't get in and the media spun it and made fun of it
[09:19.000 --> 09:26.000]  and said, oh, some people couldn't get in and they were there till one in the morning and were freezing.
[09:26.000 --> 09:36.000]  Oh, because they were celebrating coming together and valuing each other and valuing America and knowing we've been under economic war by the globalist on purpose.
[09:36.000 --> 09:42.000]  And they've shipped the drugs in and they're now teaching us to tell us our little boys or girls and chop their testicles off.
[09:42.000 --> 09:52.000]  If space aliens landed and asked for that, we'd say attack them, but they sell it as liberal and trendy. If you don't agree with it, we'll attack you. It's totally sick.
[09:52.000 --> 10:00.000]  I want to play this Tucker Carlson clip and we come back with David Knight in studio. We've got the biggest news yet. We have their scenarios, A, B and C.
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.000]  It's now been announced. It's on infowars.com. We knew it was coming out of Axios.
[10:04.000 --> 10:14.000]  Biden is going to declare himself the winner tonight. Mainstream media is going to agree. That's plan A. And then if Trump disagrees, he'll be silenced by big tech, the Internet and TV saying he's wrong.
[10:14.000 --> 10:19.000]  They're going to really try this. That's their main plan. If it's close, they're going to declare victory for Biden.
[10:19.000 --> 10:25.000]  If it's so huge for Trump, which the evidence shows it'll be, they're going to hold it up and then cause civil unrest and a breakdown.
[10:25.000 --> 10:29.000]  Then they've got to plan C as well. We're going to talk about it all.
[10:29.000 --> 10:40.000]  But first, Tucker Carlson lays it out perfectly about which side are you on. You finally got somebody that proved they're on your side, believes in America, is sick of selling us out for globalism.
[10:40.000 --> 10:43.000]  Who are you going to stand with? Here's Tucker Carlson.
[10:43.000 --> 10:51.000]  I want to begin this show with a single image. Now, the image doesn't tell you who's going to win or lose tomorrow.
[10:51.000 --> 10:57.000]  Instead, it's a metaphor for the election itself and for the moment that we're living in and will continue to live in.
[10:57.000 --> 11:04.000]  The picture is from a town called Butler, Pennsylvania. It's 35 miles north of Pittsburgh. The president held a rally there over the weekend.
[11:04.000 --> 11:10.000]  Butler's like a lot of places you'll find in this country once you head inland from the coasts. It's a former industrial town.
[11:10.000 --> 11:16.000]  They made Pullman rail cars there for many years. But it's been losing population for decades.
[11:16.000 --> 11:22.000]  There's still a lot of nice people in Butler. For 60 grand, you can buy a decent house there. It's a place you might be happy in.
[11:22.000 --> 11:30.000]  But our professional class is not impressed by Butler. They don't consider Butler, Pennsylvania, or places like it, the future.
[11:30.000 --> 11:35.000]  To them, places like Butler are embarrassing relics of a past best forgotten.
[11:35.000 --> 11:41.000]  The men of Butler may have built this country and they did, but they mean nothing to our leaders now.
[11:41.000 --> 11:46.000]  You can be certain of that because when large numbers of people in Butler started killing themselves with narcotics,
[11:46.000 --> 11:52.000]  no one in Washington or New York or Los Angeles said a word about it. And so it continued.
[11:52.000 --> 11:59.000]  There have now been so many opioid deaths in Butler that a few years ago residents built an overdose memorial in the middle of town.
[11:59.000 --> 12:07.000]  MSNBC didn't cover that. So given all of that, it was interesting how the people around Butler feel about Donald Trump.
[12:07.000 --> 12:13.000]  Here are the pictures of the president's rally there on Saturday night. Tens of thousands of people came.
[12:13.000 --> 12:19.000]  So many people that the crowd obscured the horizon. It looked like a visit from the pope.
[12:19.000 --> 12:25.000]  When was the last time a political speech drew that many people? Well, the media didn't ask.
[12:25.000 --> 12:31.000]  Instead, they attacked the rally as a super spreader event. Trump in dangers, thousands in Pennsylvania.
[12:31.000 --> 12:41.000]  OK, we'll leave the epidemiology to CNN. But the question still hung in the air. Why did all those people come? Why?
[12:41.000 --> 12:48.000]  They must have known that Donald Trump is the most evil man who's ever lived. They've heard that every day for five years.
[12:48.000 --> 12:55.000]  They know that people who support Donald Trump are also evil. They're bigots, they're morons, they're racist cult members.
[12:55.000 --> 13:00.000]  They know that Americans have been fired from their jobs for supporting Donald Trump.
[13:00.000 --> 13:06.000]  Not to mention kicked off social media, belittled by their kids' teachers, shunned by decent society.
[13:06.000 --> 13:12.000]  Only losers and freaks support Donald Trump. People in Butler knew all of that.
[13:12.000 --> 13:19.000]  But on Saturday they went to the Donald Trump rally anyway. Why exactly did they do that?
[13:19.000 --> 13:26.000]  We should be pondering that question deeply as we watch tomorrow's returns and as we live through the aftermath of them.
[13:26.000 --> 13:33.000]  Millions of Americans sincerely love Donald Trump. They love him in spite of everything they've heard.
[13:33.000 --> 13:40.000]  They love him often in spite of himself. They're not beluded. They know exactly who Trump is. They love him anyway.
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.000]  They love Donald Trump because no one else loves them.
[13:44.000 --> 13:54.000]  The country they built, the country their ancestors fought for over hundreds of years, has left them to die in their unfashionable little towns,
[13:54.000 --> 14:02.000]  mocked and despised by the sneering half wits with finance degrees, but no actual skills who seem to run everything all of a sudden.
[14:02.000 --> 14:10.000]  Whatever Donald Trump's faults, he is better than the rest of the people in charge. At least he doesn't hate them for their weakness.
[14:10.000 --> 14:18.000]  Donald Trump, in other words, is and has always been a living indictment of the people who run this country.
[14:18.000 --> 14:25.000]  That was true four years ago when Trump came out of nowhere to win the presidency, and it's every bit as true right now.
[14:25.000 --> 14:33.000]  It may be even more true than it's ever been, and it will remain true regardless of whether Donald Trump wins reelection.
[14:33.000 --> 14:43.000]  Trump rose because they failed. It's as simple as that. If the people in charge had done a halfway decent job with the country they inherited,
[14:43.000 --> 14:50.000]  if they cared about anything other than themselves, even for just a moment, Donald Trump would still be hosting celebrity apprentice,
[14:50.000 --> 14:56.000]  but they didn't. Instead, they were incompetent and narcissistic and cruel and relentlessly dishonest.
[14:56.000 --> 15:03.000]  They wrecked what they didn't build. They lied about it. They hurt anyone who told the truth about what they were doing.
[15:03.000 --> 15:11.000]  That's true. We watched. America is still a great country, the best in the world, but our ruling class is disgusting.
[15:11.000 --> 15:19.000]  A vote for Trump is a vote against them. That's what's going on in that picture. That's what's going on in this country.
[15:19.000 --> 15:29.000]  Well, what you just saw is as close to perfection with truth as it gets. That is veritas in the very archetype, and that's exactly true.
[15:29.000 --> 15:39.000]  And the system is scared because they're these big globalists. They're the masters of the universe, and they're being defeated, and they can't stand it.
[15:39.000 --> 15:45.000]  You just got to understand the chip on the shoulder that the big tech people and the chai comms and the Rothschilds have against you and your family.
[15:45.000 --> 15:53.000]  They literally hate you, research them. They want to hurt you. And the minute you realize that, their power is over.
[15:53.000 --> 15:56.000]  Don't submit to anything they say or do.
[15:56.000 --> 16:15.000]  Now it's easier than ever to have band.video on your iPhone. Simply go to band.video with your Safari browser.
[16:15.000 --> 16:21.000]  Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen. When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen.
[16:21.000 --> 16:31.000]  It will then ask you to name the app. I suggest band.video. You will now have band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[16:31.000 --> 16:39.000]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[16:39.000 --> 16:46.000]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[16:46.000 --> 16:51.000]  However you want, be sure and share band.video.
[17:17.000 --> 17:22.000]  The most ancient form of total war is called siege.
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.000]  And that's when you cut people off from their resources. That's when you lock them down.
[17:27.000 --> 17:32.000]  And this isn't siege to make us capitulate to the globalists or just get rid of Donald Trump. That's only part of it.
[17:32.000 --> 17:36.000]  This is siege to literally train us to be poor and to get us into deep debt.
[17:36.000 --> 17:45.000]  So then the globalist social engineers can dictate how we live our lives with the social credits for surveillance threat.
[17:45.000 --> 17:48.000]  You've heard the U.S. Army saying our job is to kill people and break things.
[17:48.000 --> 17:50.000]  Well, that's what the lockdown is doing.
[17:50.000 --> 18:16.000]  It's starving the third world, millions and millions of debt. It's breaking down the supply chain in society. It's their mission.
[18:20.000 --> 18:32.000]  And I was watching David Knight this morning before I went devoted and he was doing a really good job laying out what he sees unfolding.
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  He's here riding shotgun with us.
[18:34.000 --> 18:40.000]  Ho-Tep Jesus, who's a great political analyst and a very successful marketer, national marketer, a businessman.
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.000]  He's going to be also a funny guy. He's going to be popping in with us and so many other huge guests.
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  We're going to have live 24 hour coverage.
[18:46.000 --> 18:51.000]  I'm predicting that they are going to go with plan B, that it's going to be obvious that Trump is won.
[18:51.000 --> 19:00.000]  So they're going to have to say, oh, we've got to count all the ballots in Pennsylvania and Michigan and other areas and then try to drag it out the civil unrest and then hold the economy hostage.
[19:00.000 --> 19:01.000]  That's their main focus.
[19:01.000 --> 19:10.000]  But they've also been talking about, oh, just announcing that Biden wins and then basically locking down Trump supporters and locking down Trump and letting no one contest it.
[19:10.000 --> 19:20.000]  So they're saying only seven groups, ABC, CBS, NBC, Fox, CNN, and of course one other group.
[19:20.000 --> 19:21.000]  Fox is in there twice.
[19:21.000 --> 19:22.000]  Yeah, exactly.
[19:22.000 --> 19:23.000]  They get two votes.
[19:23.000 --> 19:25.000]  Yeah, so Fox and AP.
[19:25.000 --> 19:26.000]  Yeah.
[19:26.000 --> 19:27.000]  Wow.
[19:27.000 --> 19:28.000]  Yeah.
[19:28.000 --> 19:29.000]  Yeah, it's usual suspects, isn't it?
[19:29.000 --> 19:30.000]  It's usual suspects.
[19:30.000 --> 19:35.000]  So David, gut level, watching this unfold, what do you think we're about to witness here?
[19:35.000 --> 19:39.000]  Well, you know, Alex, I thought for the longest time, and I've been saying this and Richard Proctor,
[19:39.000 --> 19:41.000]  I want to talk about the Constitution frequently.
[19:41.000 --> 19:49.000]  He pointed out the 20th Amendment says that by January the 20th, you've got to have a winter or Nancy Pelosi gets to pick the people.
[19:49.000 --> 19:54.000]  So I thought they were going to try to slow walk this thing out and have chaos and lawfare and all that sort of thing.
[19:54.000 --> 19:58.000]  Except when you look at this and the pronouncements that have come out in the last 24 hours,
[19:58.000 --> 20:12.000]  as you pointed out on Info Wars, we've got the story up there about how the Axios has been informed that they're going to, if the news media declares Biden a winner, that's it.
[20:12.000 --> 20:18.000]  I mean, we're not, you know, he's going to start putting his cabinet together and he's going to start acting like the president right away.
[20:18.000 --> 20:19.000]  We're not going to wait for a recount.
[20:19.000 --> 20:21.000]  We're not going to have any contesting.
[20:21.000 --> 20:27.000]  Biden plans to assert control as President-elect if declared winner by a news organization.
[20:27.000 --> 20:29.000]  And they've got to talk about his line power.
[20:29.000 --> 20:33.000]  And notice it's been mainstream media the last three years and the internet purge.
[20:33.000 --> 20:35.000]  They're the ones that say someone's fake news.
[20:35.000 --> 20:43.000]  If CNN or ABC says you're fake news, then Big Tech bans you just like when ABC after two weeks finally said, okay, the Hunter Biden laptop's real.
[20:43.000 --> 20:46.000]  Well, then the New York Post got unbanned.
[20:46.000 --> 20:47.000]  It's a hierarchy.
[20:47.000 --> 20:49.000]  The big mainstream corporate media is God.
[20:49.000 --> 20:50.000]  It's the top folks.
[20:50.000 --> 20:53.000]  That's what the CIA and Operation Mockingbird is on record.
[20:53.000 --> 20:54.000]  That's right.
[20:54.000 --> 20:58.000]  News guard, which, you know, there was a Newsweek article today and they were talking about Microsoft.
[20:58.000 --> 20:59.000]  That's right.
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  News guard is Microsoft and it's DARPA.
[21:01.000 --> 21:03.000]  And they also have election guard.
[21:03.000 --> 21:10.000]  And honestly, Alex, when I was looking at this a year ago, I thought they were going to roll out electronic voting more and they were going to roll through the fraud.
[21:10.000 --> 21:11.000]  And that's going to come.
[21:11.000 --> 21:12.000]  That is coming.
[21:12.000 --> 21:16.000]  And they've already talked about how they're going to have, you know, crypto ballots and you know, blockchain ballots.
[21:16.000 --> 21:19.000]  But they're doing this time with just tons of fake ballots themselves.
[21:19.000 --> 21:24.000]  They're hitting at the machine level, they know there's so many checks and balances being added with the receipts and things and so many recounts.
[21:24.000 --> 21:27.000]  They're just going to directly having dead people vote.
[21:27.000 --> 21:32.000]  And the reason they're able to get away with this is because they've shut down the First Amendment and they shut it down a long time ago.
[21:32.000 --> 21:33.000]  And all over the country.
[21:33.000 --> 21:34.000]  That's right.
[21:34.000 --> 21:37.000]  And the key battlegrounds, they're blocking poll watchers and violating state law.
[21:37.000 --> 21:38.000]  That's right.
[21:38.000 --> 21:39.000]  That's right.
[21:39.000 --> 21:45.000]  And you know, when we look at this, as I've talked about many times, Alex, it's not just shutting down alternative free press like us.
[21:45.000 --> 21:49.000]  It's also shutting down the free speech of the people.
[21:49.000 --> 21:54.000]  They've got the general public isn't allowed to say anything not approved by these big seven groups.
[21:54.000 --> 21:58.000]  Big seven media can only report on it, can only say what they saw.
[21:58.000 --> 22:01.000]  If anybody else says they saw fraud, everybody else says they were unable to vote.
[22:01.000 --> 22:05.000]  If anybody else says they're a poll watch that was blocked, that will be blocked by big tech.
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  This is this is an information coup.
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  This is an attempted media coup.
[22:09.000 --> 22:13.000]  We're in the middle of they're telling us it's a media coup because they want to hide it and blame you and normalize it.
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.000]  So let's quantify this again.
[22:15.000 --> 22:16.000]  I agree with you.
[22:16.000 --> 22:18.000]  They have plan B, but they don't think that'll work.
[22:18.000 --> 22:23.000]  They're going to go directly tonight to just say Biden wins at, say, nine o'clock and then just shut everybody else down and say it.
[22:23.000 --> 22:26.000]  And then Biden just announces he's president says, here's my cabinet.
[22:26.000 --> 22:27.000]  I'm the president.
[22:27.000 --> 22:29.000]  And they just hope this big hoax goes across.
[22:29.000 --> 22:30.000]  That's right.
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.000]  And I think the plan B became a little bit more difficult for them because of Barrett.
[22:34.000 --> 22:37.000]  You know, if they'd had Ginsburg in there, they might have gone.
[22:37.000 --> 22:38.000]  Exactly.
[22:38.000 --> 22:39.000]  Yeah.
[22:39.000 --> 22:42.000]  But I think, you know, when I look at this, I think, you know, Barrett would be okay on this.
[22:42.000 --> 22:44.000]  I've got concerns about other things.
[22:44.000 --> 22:47.000]  I know Supreme Court ruled against Trump to let him keep the polling places open.
[22:47.000 --> 22:48.000]  That's right.
[22:48.000 --> 22:53.000]  And I've got concern about her understanding of the primacy of the First Amendment as well.
[22:53.000 --> 23:01.000]  Because, you know, when she was questioned as part of the hearing, say they asked her enumerate the different parts of the of the First Amendment.
[23:01.000 --> 23:02.000]  She came up short on one of them.
[23:02.000 --> 23:06.000]  But then we asked her to tie it together and say, why is this the very first one?
[23:06.000 --> 23:07.000]  And why are these things all related?
[23:07.000 --> 23:08.000]  Well, it's pretty obvious.
[23:08.000 --> 23:12.000]  I've played clips today from what's going on in Australia.
[23:12.000 --> 23:14.000]  They had 400 people who showed up.
[23:14.000 --> 23:15.000]  They've got no casualties whatsoever.
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  They're going into summer in Australia.
[23:17.000 --> 23:19.000]  They're still locked down hard.
[23:19.000 --> 23:25.000]  And they had a ring of militarized police surround them, even somebody who was just there to listen to a speaker.
[23:25.000 --> 23:26.000]  He's not part of the movement.
[23:26.000 --> 23:27.000]  He was all masked up and everything else.
[23:27.000 --> 23:30.000]  But they don't want these people to exercise their free speech.
[23:30.000 --> 23:35.000]  This is UN-directed, corporal-directed world government, world martial law.
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.000]  And Trump, to his credit, is saying no to it.
[23:37.000 --> 23:38.000]  He's having the rallies.
[23:38.000 --> 23:39.000]  He's saying, open it back up.
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  He says, just get over the virus.
[23:41.000 --> 23:43.000]  We're never going to, quote, conquer it by hiding our houses.
[23:43.000 --> 23:45.000]  And they are so pissed.
[23:45.000 --> 23:55.000]  So this is a referendum against global world government UN control, which even the New York Times today admits, OK, China did control the WHO and did control the world response.
[23:55.000 --> 24:00.000]  So the New York Times admits China's in control of the UN and controls the blue states and blue cities.
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  My God, this is insane.
[24:02.000 --> 24:11.000]  And the Stockholm syndrome women, mainly, but also some men, love going along with this and submitting to UN Chinese directed tyranny.
[24:11.000 --> 24:14.000]  You know, the thing that really made me angry, Alex, somebody sent me this.
[24:14.000 --> 24:18.000]  I didn't see it over the weekend, but they had a Halloween party and guess where?
[24:18.000 --> 24:19.000]  Wuhan.
[24:19.000 --> 24:21.000]  They had a Halloween party in Wuhan.
[24:21.000 --> 24:22.000]  They had thousands of people.
[24:22.000 --> 24:27.000]  They had people dressed up like zombie nurses in Wuhan, China.
[24:27.000 --> 24:29.000]  They are doing this in our face.
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  This is the real virus.
[24:31.000 --> 24:33.000]  This plan that was modeled for us by China.
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  The psych warfare attacks.
[24:35.000 --> 24:36.000]  Exactly.
[24:36.000 --> 24:39.000]  And, you know, first, the First Amendment and free speech.
[24:39.000 --> 24:41.000]  And it's also, you know, the free exercise of religion.
[24:41.000 --> 24:42.000]  They shut that down as well.
[24:42.000 --> 24:43.000]  All of this.
[24:43.000 --> 24:44.000]  That's right.
[24:44.000 --> 24:45.000]  I've been wearing masks anymore.
[24:45.000 --> 24:46.000]  That's right.
[24:46.000 --> 24:47.000]  It's all theater.
[24:47.000 --> 24:48.000]  Yeah, it is.
[24:48.000 --> 24:49.000]  It's total.
[24:49.000 --> 24:50.000]  You know about China.
[24:50.000 --> 24:51.000]  You're not an engineer.
[24:51.000 --> 24:52.000]  You adopted your daughter from there.
[24:52.000 --> 24:53.000]  You've been there.
[24:53.000 --> 24:54.000]  You cover.
[24:54.000 --> 24:55.000]  We cover.
[24:55.000 --> 24:56.000]  We know we're talking about China.
[24:56.000 --> 24:57.000]  Oh, yeah.
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  We're the ones that said 10 years ago, 20 years ago that, you know, you've been here almost 10 years that China is going to be the main issue.
[25:00.000 --> 25:03.000]  And it is because we're studying what the globalists are admitting.
[25:03.000 --> 25:07.000]  Well, China was set up to do everything that the globalists wanted to do.
[25:07.000 --> 25:08.000]  They wanted slave labor.
[25:08.000 --> 25:13.000]  We were told 20 or 30 years ago, you don't want to have manufacturing jobs in America.
[25:13.000 --> 25:14.000]  They're dirty.
[25:14.000 --> 25:16.000]  You want the manufacturing jobs to be in China.
[25:16.000 --> 25:17.000]  Besides that, they work cheap.
[25:17.000 --> 25:18.000]  I mean, these guys work dirt cheap.
[25:18.000 --> 25:20.000]  They work for slave wages.
[25:20.000 --> 25:21.000]  They do.
[25:21.000 --> 25:22.000]  They enslave them.
[25:22.000 --> 25:24.000]  And so what this is, is a giant sucking sound Ross.
[25:24.000 --> 25:25.000]  Exactly.
[25:25.000 --> 25:29.000]  And after they said, you just want to have the service jobs.
[25:29.000 --> 25:35.000]  And there are a lot of us who are saying, well, you know, we can't really exist by just taking in each other's laundry.
[25:35.000 --> 25:38.000]  But now we can't even do that because that's not essential.
[25:38.000 --> 25:39.000]  That's right.
[25:39.000 --> 25:49.000]  The lockdown has taken away the service economy, which was the last bastion, the last fingernail hold of the middle class on having some kind of upward mobility in the economy.
[25:49.000 --> 25:54.000]  Because they want a siege to dictate the terms of our surrender in their own admissions.
[25:54.000 --> 25:59.000]  Prince Charles, Rockefellers, they're all bragging, oh, this is cutting the carbon footprint.
[25:59.000 --> 26:02.000]  These monsters admit what they're doing to our face.
[26:02.000 --> 26:03.000]  Yeah.
[26:03.000 --> 26:04.000]  Yeah.
[26:04.000 --> 26:08.000]  They've always seen us as a virus and now they want us to see each other as a virus.
[26:08.000 --> 26:09.000]  It's a way we're dirty.
[26:09.000 --> 26:10.000]  Humans are bad.
[26:10.000 --> 26:11.000]  We're not just bad for the earth.
[26:11.000 --> 26:12.000]  We're bad for each other.
[26:12.000 --> 26:13.000]  We need to hate ourselves.
[26:13.000 --> 26:14.000]  That's right.
[26:14.000 --> 26:15.000]  So we won't stand up for ourselves.
[26:15.000 --> 26:19.000]  We're being taught like a beaten, like a pimp, tortures a woman and beats her to a controller.
[26:19.000 --> 26:20.000]  We're just being pimped.
[26:20.000 --> 26:21.000]  We're being bit slapped.
[26:21.000 --> 26:22.000]  We're being brought down.
[26:22.000 --> 26:24.000]  We're being taught to have no respect for ourselves.
[26:24.000 --> 26:25.000]  That's right.
[26:25.000 --> 26:29.000]  They want you afraid of each other even in your homes for Thanksgiving.
[26:29.000 --> 26:30.000]  I'm only looking at this Halloween.
[26:30.000 --> 26:31.000]  Wear a mask while you have sex.
[26:31.000 --> 26:32.000]  Well, stay there, David.
[26:32.000 --> 26:33.000]  Yeah.
[26:33.000 --> 26:34.000]  Because here's the big question.
[26:34.000 --> 26:36.000]  We're not just saying this.
[26:36.000 --> 26:39.000]  They are announcing and saying it's ground zero.
[26:39.000 --> 26:41.000]  It's zero hour.
[26:41.000 --> 26:46.000]  They're announcing Biden's officially saying his campaign that we're going to say I'm the winner tonight.
[26:46.000 --> 26:47.000]  The mainstream media is going to announce it.
[26:47.000 --> 26:48.000]  This is a media coup.
[26:48.000 --> 26:50.000]  How do we counter this when we come right back?
[26:50.000 --> 26:52.000]  We're supposed to not be on the air.
[26:52.000 --> 26:53.000]  We're still on the air right now, folks.
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  The people have a voice.
[26:55.000 --> 26:57.000]  It's all on record.
[26:57.000 --> 27:03.000]  Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, they were all hired a year ago.
[27:03.000 --> 27:09.000]  And then again, six months ago to war game, how to get the public to stay locked down during a pandemic
[27:09.000 --> 27:12.000]  and how to get the public to take inoculations.
[27:12.000 --> 27:14.000]  And they talk about calling people heroes that do it.
[27:14.000 --> 27:16.000]  They talk about shaming those that don't.
[27:16.000 --> 27:20.000]  This has all been psychologically tested.
[27:20.000 --> 27:22.000]  It's all been psychologically prepared.
[27:22.000 --> 27:26.000]  And once they get you to lock down for 15 days, you notice now they say it's permanent.
[27:26.000 --> 27:27.000]  That's how it works.
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  Oh, just put these handcuffs on.
[27:29.000 --> 27:33.000]  The serial killer says the woman in the parking lot and everything will be all right.
[27:33.000 --> 27:34.000]  No.
[27:34.000 --> 27:38.000]  Now we've already put the handcuffs on and we're in the serial killer's van.
[27:38.000 --> 27:43.000]  He's taking us to his shack in the woods to slowly torture us to death.
[27:43.000 --> 27:44.000]  That's the allegory.
[27:44.000 --> 27:45.000]  We got to bust out of this thing now.
[27:45.000 --> 27:47.000]  We got to say no now.
[27:47.000 --> 27:48.000]  We got to make a run for it now.
[27:48.000 --> 27:49.000]  We still can.
[27:49.000 --> 27:53.000]  Once he gets us in that base, but it's going to get a lot, lot worse, folks.
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.000]  So stop submitting.
[27:55.000 --> 28:00.000]  I get asked all the time by listeners, by the media, what am I most proud of when it comes to the show?
[28:00.000 --> 28:08.000]  And it's the fact that in full war is more than 25 years ago doing basic research with what the club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying.
[28:08.000 --> 28:18.000]  Develop the hypothesis that Communist China had been set up to take our jobs and transfer them to China and then make us economically destitute and position us into debt.
[28:18.000 --> 28:19.000]  Well, now China owns the debt.
[28:19.000 --> 28:22.000]  Now China owns Hollywood, all the one side of trading deals.
[28:22.000 --> 28:25.000]  It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on.
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  But again, it wasn't that hard.
[28:27.000 --> 28:33.000]  The CFR and others admitted what they were doing, but still others didn't want to focus on that issue.
[28:33.000 --> 28:34.000]  We did.
[28:34.000 --> 28:37.000]  And you focused on it by supporting us and in full worse.
[28:37.000 --> 28:44.000]  So when you go to infowarstore.com and get all the great supplements, books, t-shirts, films, water filtration, air filtration, all of it,
[28:44.000 --> 28:48.000]  you're funding the organization that literally helped make up the world what's really happening.
[28:48.000 --> 28:50.000]  So that's a big accomplishment for all of you.
[28:50.000 --> 29:19.000]  I want to thank you for your support.
[29:21.000 --> 29:34.000]  Also, no offensive violence, no killing or shooting, anybody that isn't trying to kill or shooting, you have no desire for this.
[29:34.000 --> 29:41.000]  We have been talking about the Democrats calling for Civil War, calling for an overrun in the White House, calling for killing Trump, calling for killing cops.
[29:41.000 --> 29:45.200]  the violent attacks and we're simply saying that if they kill Trump or have a fraudulent
[29:45.200 --> 29:49.680]  election and throw him out of office and come after us, people have to be ready to defend
[29:49.680 --> 29:57.880]  themselves. Defense, not offense. Look out for false flags.
[29:57.880 --> 30:15.880]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[30:15.880 --> 30:20.240]  Is it the countdown to the globalist being extincted or is it the countdown to the extinction
[30:20.240 --> 30:29.520]  of America? We're fighting for our lives. It is election day, November 3rd, 2020. I'm
[30:29.520 --> 30:34.640]  your host Alex Jones. Ho-Tip Jesus is with us about 35 minutes or so. David Knight's
[30:34.640 --> 30:39.600]  riding shotgun with us into the next hour. We've got everybody coming on. Roger Stone,
[30:39.600 --> 30:44.040]  you name it here today and your phone calls it so much more. But all the hysteria you
[30:44.040 --> 30:47.080]  see is about this.
[30:47.080 --> 30:49.880]  Madam President, she was supposed to be the winner. They printed up a quarter million
[30:49.880 --> 30:55.360]  of these. They even were delivering them to the airports and bookstores and grocery store
[30:55.360 --> 31:04.960]  newsstands the morning after they lost in 2016. Madam President, she says, oh, plan
[31:04.960 --> 31:08.880]  B is we're just going to keep counting ballots forever and he will not be president. Below
[31:08.880 --> 31:14.640]  she says Biden will be president and now you add to all this. They've asked the military
[31:14.640 --> 31:17.920]  to help remove Trump. They've said, again, no, next segment, we've got Chairman of the
[31:17.920 --> 31:23.920]  Joint of Staff on video saying we will not be part of a coup. Raping America since 93,
[31:23.920 --> 31:29.720]  the Epstein crime syndicate of the Clintons and of course Bill Gates, who sits on top
[31:29.720 --> 31:32.640]  of it like a big evil spider.
[31:32.640 --> 31:35.600]  Coming up next segment, we're going to talk about this with Ho-Tip Jesus and more. We've
[31:35.600 --> 31:39.600]  got the Sunshine Project at Millie. We were at a great job six months ago exposing, but
[31:39.600 --> 31:43.080]  now more of their videos have come out, how they're planning with Soros and Black Lives
[31:43.080 --> 31:50.280]  Matter to overthrow the White House. So that's the grassroots cover for all of this. But
[31:50.280 --> 31:54.520]  plan A is to just announce him the winner tonight, Joe Biden and have the media go along
[31:54.520 --> 31:58.000]  with it and then quote, they've told us they're going to silence Trump. So you say, why would
[31:58.000 --> 32:01.200]  they admit all this up front? They have to normalize it like, oh, we're going to have
[32:01.200 --> 32:05.360]  convicted pedophiles come unannounced at your public school and have your six-year-old bounce
[32:05.360 --> 32:10.320]  on their erection to their pants. You're like, that's insane. Yeah, it is. We'll call you
[32:10.320 --> 32:15.720]  evil if you don't go along with it. This is the plan, is the hide it in plain view. Ho-Tip
[32:15.720 --> 32:19.440]  Jesus joins us here. We really appreciate him coming on. We'll get him on tomorrow too
[32:19.440 --> 32:22.680]  in the aftermath. I think it's going to be extended out. They'd like to go plan B, but
[32:22.680 --> 32:29.680]  we'll see. They want to go plan A. Ho-TipNation.com. He is a startup tech founder and has been
[32:29.680 --> 32:33.520]  marketing for close to two decades with traditional digital spheres, a writer and thought leader.
[32:33.520 --> 32:37.320]  He has cultivated a loyal following on social media being honest and genuine while providing
[32:37.320 --> 32:41.120]  knowledge and experience. Ho-Tip, I got a lot of questions for you, but what's your
[32:41.120 --> 32:47.040]  first takeaway right now about where we are and what you're predicting?
[32:47.040 --> 32:52.280]  I think Trump has legitimate concerns about the legitimacy of our elections this year.
[32:52.280 --> 32:55.920]  And if he did not accept the results, I would totally and completely understand. And I'll
[32:55.920 --> 33:03.720]  tell you why. By the hour, if not by the half hour, we're seeing videos unfold of election
[33:03.720 --> 33:10.680]  meddling. I saw in PA, there's a sign up outside of an election station that was pure Democrats
[33:10.680 --> 33:15.640]  down ballot. And the authorities had to come in and take down that sign. I'm seeing people
[33:15.640 --> 33:22.160]  arguing at certain polling stations, not letting certain Republican watchers in, poll watchers
[33:22.160 --> 33:28.560]  in. And it's a disgrace and it's terrible to watch, but I think Trump has a legitimate
[33:28.560 --> 33:31.400]  concern. You're absolutely right. Do you think they're
[33:31.400 --> 33:35.040]  going to try to pull? They've got both set up. If there's a C, I'll talk about later,
[33:35.040 --> 33:38.640]  but A and B, do you agree with that scenario of try to steal it tonight? Have the media
[33:38.640 --> 33:42.800]  announce him? The leader, he declares he's the president, launches his government immediately.
[33:42.800 --> 33:45.840]  He says that's his plan. They're saying he's going to win. Of course, they know that's
[33:45.840 --> 33:51.480]  not true. All the internal metrics, web numbers, actual real traffic, internal polls, doubled
[33:51.480 --> 33:55.280]  the amount of people searching how to vote Republican, all the other hundreds of metrics
[33:55.280 --> 34:00.280]  to me show a huge landslide. But I think they're crazy enough to try scenario one. Why will
[34:00.280 --> 34:04.160]  they not go with scenario one? Why would they go with a scenario two to drag it out, which
[34:04.160 --> 34:08.560]  we know they've got set up as well, hotel? Yeah, they want to drag it out. And I think
[34:08.560 --> 34:12.800]  there's, well, first, my first concern is how the heck did Hillary Clinton become an
[34:12.800 --> 34:16.360]  elector in New York? Well, I don't think we need to answer that question. We all know
[34:16.360 --> 34:21.400]  the answer to that question. We might not know who the new president is going to be
[34:21.400 --> 34:27.920]  tonight. There's a chance that that decision or announcement may be deferred. But I think
[34:27.920 --> 34:33.520]  what's happening is they're planning some sort of violent insurrection, some sort of
[34:33.520 --> 34:39.760]  fake revolution. We know the White House was on announced to be on lockdown. And I think
[34:39.760 --> 34:45.360]  they'd much rather have four years of complaining about Trump because it's profitable to the
[34:45.360 --> 34:52.000]  media and it's profitable to other powers that be. They get to gentrify communities
[34:52.000 --> 34:59.560]  after they burn them down. So there's that sort of interest. But it comes down to the
[34:59.560 --> 35:03.720]  fact that I think they want, they want something to complain about. I think America is boring
[35:03.720 --> 35:09.440]  without Trump in office. And I think they want to create some sort of violence over
[35:09.440 --> 35:13.560]  the next week or so. I agree. In fact, that's where David Knight wanted to go this segment
[35:13.560 --> 35:18.440]  is this sunshine group, David. Yeah, you know, I think, too, that when we look at this and
[35:18.440 --> 35:23.000]  look at two different scenarios, could they come out and try to create a fake blue wave
[35:23.000 --> 35:27.000]  by the fact that they say that they've had two thirds of the people who voted in the
[35:27.000 --> 35:32.600]  last election have already early voted 97, I think million votes, they're saying. And
[35:32.600 --> 35:37.040]  so they could create a fake blue wave and then have a pronouncement with us. But I think
[35:37.040 --> 35:42.400]  Alex, the real issue, what they're looking for is chaos and civil war. And I think not
[35:42.400 --> 35:47.480]  only, you know, the ploy of dragging this out and having Nancy Pelosi pick somebody
[35:47.480 --> 35:52.760]  on January 20th, according to 20th Amendment, I think they want to have a prolonged unrest.
[35:52.760 --> 35:56.800]  I think everything that we've been seeing for the last year, not just the election,
[35:56.800 --> 36:02.080]  but also the lockdown is designed to create everything is martial law. Everything is America
[36:02.080 --> 36:06.080]  failed. Everything is get deeper in debt. Exactly. Whether Trump's president or not,
[36:06.080 --> 36:10.080]  they're trying to kill the economy and absorb us. And even if we're able to get Trump in,
[36:10.080 --> 36:13.520]  the blue states and cities are going to stay locked down. That's right. That's right. And
[36:13.520 --> 36:16.400]  they're also going to lock down the federal government. This is why I think we need to
[36:16.400 --> 36:19.680]  start thinking outside the electoral box. Oh, that's key. We'll cover it next time.
[36:19.680 --> 36:23.040]  But start getting into that. These are federal employees, including intelligence operatives
[36:23.040 --> 36:26.720]  who are currently serving announcing that they're inside government are going to shut
[36:26.720 --> 36:30.120]  things in sabotage. They should all be indicted. But of course, they won't. That's right. And
[36:30.120 --> 36:33.480]  of course, you know, there's, there's laws against employees. They try to use that from
[36:33.480 --> 36:37.640]  time to time against Republicans. There's laws against employees campaigning actively
[36:37.640 --> 36:40.800]  for other sites. And they were saying, well, you know, had to be careful about some of
[36:40.800 --> 36:44.720]  these lines that were getting pretty close to actually their way over the line. They're
[36:44.720 --> 36:50.200]  talking about how they can not only slow walk, but they can, they can delay something or
[36:50.200 --> 36:55.560]  keep it from happening by playing their, their red tape games and all because they call him
[36:55.560 --> 37:00.800]  a dictator. Obama came out, we have the clip coming up and called him a dictator for saying
[37:00.800 --> 37:04.320]  he'll contest if they can test that. That's just insane. Ho-Tep, let me ask you this.
[37:04.320 --> 37:07.160]  We'll get more of this next time. We got a few minutes here. How do we counter this?
[37:07.160 --> 37:12.000]  What can we do on zero hour to counter this? I say stay on air, spread the word. They wanted
[37:12.000 --> 37:15.680]  us all off air. We're still on air. You're on air reaching millions. I think that's really
[37:15.680 --> 37:18.160]  it as we just don't back down or what do we do?
[37:18.160 --> 37:23.720]  Yeah. I believe Rogan's going live tonight. Ho-Tep's we're going live tonight for a special
[37:23.720 --> 37:29.520]  episode. We have to consistently be in people's faces and give them an alternative view and
[37:29.520 --> 37:35.800]  it's working. As we saw with the techno crats, they are scared. They are afraid. Last night
[37:35.800 --> 37:40.520]  they suspended, I believe 40, maybe 50 accounts. They suspended the young girl Samantha. I
[37:40.520 --> 37:44.360]  believe they suspended her Instagram account, Rob Snyder, a nuclear physicist. They suspended
[37:44.360 --> 37:50.040]  his account. When I looked at the tweet, I didn't see anything wrong, but they are scared,
[37:50.040 --> 37:55.000]  which makes me optimistic that Trump pulls this out because they are censoring, as we
[37:55.000 --> 37:58.960]  saw with the New York Post last week. Then they had to admit they had no proof that there
[37:58.960 --> 38:05.200]  was some sort of hack involved in the New York posting of that article. Zuckerberg,
[38:05.200 --> 38:09.680]  Dorsey, they both had to retract their statements, but they're running scared. I think they know
[38:09.680 --> 38:13.960]  it's a potential rare wave coming. Bingo, Ho-Tep, but that's what makes them dangerous.
[38:13.960 --> 38:16.720]  What do you think they might pull? I'm worried about false flags. I'm worried about them
[38:16.720 --> 38:21.880]  going and blowing up a black church or something. Seriously, I am. Yeah. Yeah. I believe the
[38:21.880 --> 38:27.000]  gentleman sitting next to you, hitting right on the head. They're looking to try and push
[38:27.000 --> 38:34.320]  some sort of civil war to install, like you said, martial law, as well as, so we got the
[38:34.320 --> 38:38.960]  civil war. Oh, COVID, right? So then we're going to have potentially a second wave of
[38:38.960 --> 38:44.160]  lockdowns surrounding COVID out of nowhere, just going to magically appear again like
[38:44.160 --> 38:49.120]  people are dying or something like that. So it's about control, and that's what they
[38:49.120 --> 38:56.320]  want. If they can create unrest, they have the excuse to take control and to remove
[38:56.320 --> 39:03.640]  civil liberties and to install fascist communism, fascist socialism, and remove everybody's
[39:03.640 --> 39:07.640]  civil liberties. It's disgusting. That's right, because they've already won everywhere else,
[39:07.640 --> 39:10.720]  so they just think, why don't we just keep pushing? Well, this is America. That's why
[39:10.720 --> 39:14.840]  they flooded us with drugs and with racial division and poison and attack our children
[39:14.840 --> 39:18.920]  to make us weak because they know we are strong. And if we don't just play the part of victims,
[39:18.920 --> 39:23.640]  we play the part of victors and override that and come together. We have a real chance at
[39:23.640 --> 39:27.720]  beating this thing and having the American system challenge this godless globalist system.
[39:27.720 --> 39:32.640]  Hope that Jesus is our guest in studio. David Knight is here so much more coming up. I am
[39:32.640 --> 39:36.880]  your host Alex Jones. We'll be right back with the video of these Zoom meetings of these
[39:36.880 --> 39:42.000]  federal employees talking about what they're planning. This is the real teeth behind BLM
[39:42.000 --> 39:48.920]  and ANTIFA. We'll be right back, infowars.com. The site you need to promote is electionknight.news.
[39:48.920 --> 39:54.160]  That's the one that you're not censoring at this point, electionknight.news, electionknight.news.
[39:54.160 --> 39:59.280]  Election 2020 is here, and whether Trump wins or loses, we have all won by exposing the
[39:59.280 --> 40:05.240]  Communist Chinese, by exposing the globalist, by exposing the pedophile rings, by exposing
[40:05.240 --> 40:10.080]  the fact this is really a fight between good versus evil. Now I'm personally a Christian
[40:10.080 --> 40:13.800]  and I believe in God, and I know God's real and I've experienced it in my life. But even
[40:13.800 --> 40:17.800]  you don't believe in God, it's important to recognize that there is good in this world,
[40:17.800 --> 40:21.360]  there is evil. And there are people out there that want to do you harm because they enjoy
[40:21.360 --> 40:27.240]  doing bad. And what I see happening across the spectrum of different political views
[40:27.240 --> 40:33.160]  is people finally get that, they finally understand that they're not being naive anymore. Don't
[40:33.160 --> 40:38.800]  ever project your decency and your goodness onto other people until they've proven
[40:38.800 --> 40:42.840]  what they stand for and who they are, or you're going to get hurt. But those of you
[40:42.840 --> 40:46.200]  out there that have done your own research and discovered who's good and who is faithful,
[40:46.200 --> 40:51.160]  well then come together with those organizations and support them like infowars. Because without
[40:51.160 --> 40:54.040]  your support, infowars would not exist.
[40:54.040 --> 41:00.120]  The problem with social Darwinism is the so-called elites, the most cunning, smart, inventive
[41:00.120 --> 41:07.000]  people believe that chivalry doesn't exist anymore, they don't believe in being aristocrats,
[41:07.000 --> 41:11.040]  trying to hold up civilization and power the people. And once the establishment has that
[41:11.040 --> 41:15.520]  predatory idea, civilization collapses very, very quickly. You can't treat the least of
[41:15.520 --> 41:21.040]  us like garbage and not treat your own family like that. And so it is this lack of empathy
[41:21.040 --> 41:25.760]  that's going to destroy us. The globalists can try to be heartless devil worshipers that
[41:25.760 --> 41:31.320]  commit rituals of all sorts of horrible crimes, try to get away from humanity, but really
[41:31.320 --> 41:35.440]  they can't escape the laws of the universe. They may train themselves to commit heinous
[41:35.440 --> 41:40.720]  crimes and not feel it themselves, but the repercussions of what they commit always comes
[41:40.720 --> 41:44.240]  back on them and their families and the very structure itself.
[41:44.240 --> 41:48.680]  Wealth is created by loving God. Wealth is created by having a connection to God. God
[41:48.680 --> 41:55.280]  is the source of all creation, all success, all power. If we deny that, you'll be destroyed.
[41:55.280 --> 42:00.680]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed. And why is that? It's
[42:00.680 --> 42:05.960]  one of the tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree-like bush grows from it that produces
[42:05.960 --> 42:12.080]  more mustard seeds. Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing
[42:12.080 --> 42:16.000]  health effects. They didn't know why. Well, with modern science we know it's one of the
[42:16.000 --> 42:23.400]  purest, cleanest, organic forms of selenium. We have bio-trust selenium sold out for months
[42:23.400 --> 42:30.600]  back in stock at InfoWarsStore.com at 50% off, store-wide free shipping, and triple
[42:30.600 --> 42:38.800]  Patriot Points. Bio-trust selenium at InfoWarsStore.com is an amazing product, and it's even more
[42:38.800 --> 42:43.680]  amazing in that it funds our operation. But if you don't know about selenium, research
[42:43.680 --> 42:48.440]  it. It is an essential nutrient in the body that you actually have to have. It's back
[42:48.440 --> 42:54.760]  in stock 50% off, triple Patriot Points at InfoWarsStore.com, and with free shipping.
[42:54.760 --> 42:59.960]  Remember, don't worry, be happy, everything's going to be all right. Over and over, you're
[42:59.960 --> 43:05.360]  ever told. Let the technocracy spy on you. Let big tech control what you do. They will
[43:05.360 --> 43:10.200]  never abuse their power. They will never hurt you. And just as soon as they got their
[43:10.200 --> 43:16.120]  global AI grid in, they used Communist China as the beta test to sell the world on a dystopic
[43:16.120 --> 43:20.360]  martial law lockdown. When it all started eight, nine months ago, I told you, it's never
[43:20.360 --> 43:23.440]  going to end. They're never going to turn lose to this power. They're going to make
[43:23.440 --> 43:29.520]  you have internal passports on your phones to leave your house, to have a job, to travel.
[43:29.520 --> 43:34.920]  They're going to add more and more restrictions on of how you get that travel pass. Remember
[43:34.920 --> 43:39.240]  the running man, Schwarzenegger movie, the mid-80s, written by Stephen King about a
[43:39.240 --> 43:46.240]  future police state. Watch that movie and then compare it to today. We are in the absolute
[43:46.240 --> 43:52.280]  brand, the absolute mold of a classic authoritarian dystopic nightmare. We've got to reject this
[43:52.280 --> 43:57.360]  now before it's submitted.
[43:57.360 --> 44:10.960]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show. You are listening to an info wars dot com front
[44:10.960 --> 44:25.040]  line report. If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance coming to you live
[44:25.040 --> 44:34.280]  from the info wars dot com studios in the recaptured Texas. It's Alex Jones. I love
[44:34.280 --> 44:40.480]  it. I agree with hotel Jesus 110%. The enemy's running scared. Everything they do is a failure.
[44:40.480 --> 44:45.600]  They're all these inbred, crazy globalists that their grandparents stole all the power.
[44:45.600 --> 44:49.320]  And now they just sit around going, we got all the money, all these digits we made up.
[44:49.320 --> 44:54.120]  These people got stuff. They're having a good time and we need to run their lives. So we're
[44:54.120 --> 44:56.800]  going to put stuff in their body and we're going to tell them what to do and we're going
[44:56.800 --> 45:01.360]  to put a diaper over their face. And they may get the followers to go along with them,
[45:01.360 --> 45:05.320]  but all that's going to do is piss off the leaders who weren't trying to be leaders.
[45:05.320 --> 45:09.960]  We're trying to be left alone. They have a nightser with me riding shotgun as well. He'll
[45:09.960 --> 45:14.640]  be with us throughout the evening with so many gigantic guests and big surprises here.
[45:14.640 --> 45:18.640]  We're going 24 hours plus. I predict they go plan B. They're trying to do plan A. They
[45:18.640 --> 45:23.120]  want to do it. If it's close, they're going to announce it at 9 or 10 tonight. And then
[45:23.120 --> 45:27.120]  just say, I'm the president. He says he's going to do this. Thearticlesoninfowords.com
[45:27.120 --> 45:32.440]  from Axios. That is so huge. But I just, I don't see them getting away with that though.
[45:32.440 --> 45:35.280]  They're going to try it. They're going to go plan B because that's how the globalist
[45:35.280 --> 45:41.040]  win is dividing us further. But I really see it backfiring. Hotep Jesus, I said, what are
[45:41.040 --> 45:45.200]  key points you want to make? You brought up early central point. What should we be looking
[45:45.200 --> 45:51.560]  out for? Because I agree they're running scared. They're bloods in the water, but there's always
[45:51.560 --> 45:55.760]  a silver lining. Even for the bad guys, there's always a blind spot for us. What's our blind
[45:55.760 --> 46:00.160]  spot? Those of us that want pro human liberty, who are about energy, not what color we are,
[46:00.160 --> 46:03.640]  but our energy, our spirit, because I can tell you, Trump is into people's energy. You're
[46:03.640 --> 46:07.840]  into people's energy. So is David. The real truth is it's energy. We're energy beings.
[46:07.840 --> 46:12.000]  And Trump is into energy. The enemy wants to suck energy. Trump wants to empower energy.
[46:12.000 --> 46:17.520]  We want to empower energy. So, so, so in this fight, what should we be looking for? What's
[46:17.520 --> 46:24.080]  our six? What's our, well, well, one concern is that we know from the globalist we saw
[46:24.080 --> 46:30.800]  in Nigeria and SARS, right? And I told people not to get too involved in that. But I spoke
[46:30.800 --> 46:34.760]  to a couple of people connected to Africa and I asked him, I said, Hey, what are the gun
[46:34.760 --> 46:40.440]  rights in Africa? And they are pretty much non existent. It's almost impossible to get
[46:40.440 --> 46:45.400]  a firearm and you can't even own a pistol. And you look at what they're dealing with
[46:45.400 --> 46:51.280]  police brutality that is way worse than what we're dealing with here in America. I mean,
[46:51.280 --> 46:55.760]  it's just complete brutality that people can't even defend themselves. They're completely
[46:55.760 --> 47:00.040]  unarmed. And that's what the globalists want here in America. So what we're going to see
[47:00.040 --> 47:04.680]  is, well, we know that they want to do gun grabbing. We know that Joe Biden wants to
[47:04.680 --> 47:12.640]  grab our guns. He doesn't want us to own our AR 14, as he would say, right? But the bigger
[47:12.640 --> 47:19.880]  issue here is when it comes to these insurrections and these coups and these fake revolutions,
[47:19.880 --> 47:24.080]  what they're going to try and do is they're going to try and make it look like these people
[47:24.080 --> 47:28.920]  are right leaning. They're going to have agents that are going to oppose as Trump supporters,
[47:28.920 --> 47:35.800]  agents that oppose as Confederate flag wearing individuals or fake proud boys and put the
[47:35.800 --> 47:42.400]  blame on them. And if that is not possible, they're going to run cover for these protests
[47:42.400 --> 47:46.480]  as just like Joe Biden tried to call them peaceful protesters. And Michelle Obama and
[47:46.480 --> 47:53.240]  the rest of them said, you know, it's mostly peaceful. But that's what the media, the technocrats
[47:53.240 --> 47:57.960]  and everybody they're going to try and cover for. What we have to be mindful of is our
[47:57.960 --> 48:05.040]  rhetoric on social media. They're looking for anything to ban large accounts. They will
[48:05.040 --> 48:10.960]  find any excuse to do so. So we have to become as clever as it were in a 2016 election. A
[48:10.960 --> 48:15.200]  lot of people like to call them dog whistles, but I think it's just coded language that
[48:15.200 --> 48:20.360]  we have to use to outsmart them. It worked to get Trump elected in 2016. Alex Jones was
[48:20.360 --> 48:27.040]  an info wars was a pivotal part of getting Trump elected. And that's why we saw last
[48:27.040 --> 48:32.120]  week with the broken stream never happened before. But for some reason, a lot of users
[48:32.120 --> 48:39.400]  couldn't get your episode. A mysteriously, there was some sort of problem there. And
[48:39.400 --> 48:44.480]  I think it comes down to a lot of things you exposed, not even the first 10 minutes, the
[48:44.480 --> 48:50.320]  first two minutes when I turned it on, I say, Oh my God, I just turned the episode on and
[48:50.320 --> 48:55.880]  he's already dropping bombs. Whoa. And, you know, of course, some of it I've heard, but
[48:55.880 --> 49:03.280]  I think the way you put it is so devastating and so revealing that it might actually wake
[49:03.280 --> 49:07.720]  a lot of the people up. The people that we're really trying to get to are the people in
[49:07.720 --> 49:13.680]  the middle. The leftist, they're not going to budge. Some of them have moved over, right?
[49:13.680 --> 49:17.960]  Some of them. But the people in the middle, when they hear you, when they hear me, when
[49:17.960 --> 49:23.280]  they hear Uncle Hotep, when they hear a lot of the other voices online, Mr. Knight sitting
[49:23.280 --> 49:29.280]  next to you, they have to question and they have to rethink who they're following and
[49:29.280 --> 49:34.840]  who they're voting for. But I just thought it was so mysterious that your episode was
[49:34.840 --> 49:38.280]  the only one we had technical issues on. I don't want to get the middle of what happened
[49:38.280 --> 49:42.240]  with Joe, but obviously some of the people went in and rebelled and they took it down
[49:42.240 --> 49:45.120]  and then they put it back up and they took it down again and it just kept happening.
[49:45.120 --> 49:49.720]  And then they told Joe, they gaslight him. No, Joe, it's just a glitch, but they kept
[49:49.720 --> 49:53.320]  reuploading it. And that's what's going on. And the behind the scenes stuff is even worse
[49:53.320 --> 49:56.880]  than that. I'm out of liberty to get into it, but Joe's gone through a lot. He had a lot
[49:56.880 --> 50:00.440]  of courage to have me on. That's why I was invited on tonight's show. I bowed out because
[50:00.440 --> 50:04.080]  this is our own show we're doing. And it's just, it's too soon. We got some other stuff
[50:04.080 --> 50:06.920]  coming up soon. I'm going to leave it at that, but next time I'm not going to announce what's
[50:06.920 --> 50:09.760]  happening because are you going to be on with him tonight? You not?
[50:09.760 --> 50:15.600]  I was invited on there and, and then I can't get into it on air. We'll see, but, but, but
[50:15.600 --> 50:19.400]  it's, it's not Joe's doing. It's my doing just because this is strategic stuff going
[50:19.400 --> 50:23.440]  on. But David, what he said is key. I should have, I'm going to start the show today with
[50:23.440 --> 50:26.920]  this is the era of false flags. This is the time for false flags. The only card they've
[50:26.920 --> 50:31.480]  got is blaming on the boogaloo's that are obviously, you know, controlled by the global
[50:31.480 --> 50:34.560]  something. And then the pro boys who were great, who they've been demonizing and setting
[50:34.560 --> 50:38.160]  up and casting as white supremacist. And that way they conducted to Trump and everybody
[50:38.160 --> 50:42.200]  else. I mean, they're clearly, they don't have command and control completely now.
[50:42.200 --> 50:46.480]  So they're worried about false flags because I know we're watching, but I agree with hotep.
[50:46.480 --> 50:51.320]  False flag is their ace card right now. Do you remember Alex in 2013? It was shortly
[50:51.320 --> 50:56.760]  after I came here about it. I had been here a full year and they had the army war college
[50:56.760 --> 51:01.440]  and they had a scenario. They said, you got a bunch of rednecks in Darlington, South Carolina
[51:01.440 --> 51:06.080]  allied with Russia and they want us to cede from the union. And so what do we do? We're
[51:06.080 --> 51:09.960]  going to war game this out. And you were like, what is going on? I mean, we'd never heard
[51:09.960 --> 51:14.320]  anything at that point in time about Russia, Russia, Russia, right? And it was like, and
[51:14.320 --> 51:18.880]  as you pointed out, you said, there's nobody that hates Russia more than the, the red,
[51:18.880 --> 51:22.480]  white and blue country guys. So why would they put these two together? They were already
[51:22.480 --> 51:29.480]  war gaming the false flags. And of course, Hillary Clinton, after the, her data was exposed
[51:29.480 --> 51:33.680]  four years ago, she did a classic red herring. She said, well, you know, don't look at the
[51:33.680 --> 51:37.400]  data. Who released this? Oh, I think it was the Russians. They probably did it in conjunction
[51:37.400 --> 51:42.040]  with those John Deere guys in Darlington, South Carolina. But this is what they want.
[51:42.040 --> 51:46.160]  And this is what they've been war gaming. And they would like to have us react to that
[51:46.160 --> 51:51.360]  in a violent way. And I think we need to think outside the box. We need to not just be reactionary
[51:51.360 --> 51:56.120]  to them. We need to be proactive. We need to be upfront saying we don't support offensive
[51:56.120 --> 51:59.360]  violence because they keep having articles saying I'm calling for violence. No, I'm not.
[51:59.360 --> 52:02.520]  I said, if you come to my house and if it hurt me, you're going to get it. Yeah. And
[52:02.520 --> 52:06.400]  we need also that's not offensive. We need to also make sure that we don't fall into
[52:06.400 --> 52:11.480]  the trap of centralization. That is their strength. That is what they want. They want
[52:11.480 --> 52:16.600]  not only a centralized national government, but they want a centralized world government.
[52:16.600 --> 52:19.840]  So we're not going to find out what's the danger of us. Sure. What's the danger of
[52:19.840 --> 52:23.360]  us doing that? Where are we, the Liberty movement, the poppies movement centralizing what betting
[52:23.360 --> 52:26.480]  too much on Trump? I think we're betting too much on the presidency on the, on the Supreme
[52:26.480 --> 52:32.280]  Court. Look, I've seen in my life liberals who want to have everything decided by a federal
[52:32.280 --> 52:36.000]  law, make a federal case out of everything and have the Supreme Court dictate everything
[52:36.000 --> 52:37.680]  to everybody. No, I agree with you.
[52:37.680 --> 52:41.520]  The surface who are looking for that as a solution. I mean, I think Trump, the Supreme
[52:41.520 --> 52:45.280]  Court has ruled against him and against the Constitution. And so we have to reclaim that
[52:45.280 --> 52:49.480]  they can keep these damn polls going for weeks. We have to reclaim the ninth and 10th amendment,
[52:49.480 --> 52:55.520]  but even more importantly, non violently living our lives. Look, when you see a church like
[52:55.520 --> 53:01.520]  the, like John McArthur's church in LA, 7,000 people every week meeting and defiant and
[53:01.520 --> 53:04.800]  the courts just ruled that Newsom's wrong. That's right. That's right. One court, one
[53:04.800 --> 53:10.080]  judge has, but regardless of whether the judge or the court or the Supreme Court overthrows
[53:10.080 --> 53:13.160]  them, we have to stand up and the way this is going to happen. And we said this from
[53:13.160 --> 53:16.360]  the very beginning, I had John rapper poor on my show and he said, look, we're coming
[53:16.360 --> 53:20.440]  up to Easter. He said, the way we shut this thing down, we got to have the churches say,
[53:20.440 --> 53:24.560]  we're going to fear God, not a government and we're going to stand up and do this because
[53:24.560 --> 53:27.320]  the businesses aren't going to do it. And that's how we have to claim this with our
[53:27.320 --> 53:32.760]  families, with our churches, with our communities. We live our lives in defiance of their centralization.
[53:32.760 --> 53:37.040]  Absolutely. Ho-Tep Jesus, David Knight, stay with us listeners. You're king. You spread
[53:37.040 --> 53:40.240]  the articles, you spread the videos, you spread the live link and say, here's the censored
[53:40.240 --> 53:45.600]  live coverage. They don't need to see Alex. Yes, sir. Ho-Tep first amendment, Alex. That's
[53:45.600 --> 53:50.820]  what they are after. You see the first amendment protects the second amendment. If they can
[53:50.820 --> 53:57.240]  take us, if they can take our freedom of speech, we have lost the battle. And that's what the
[53:57.240 --> 54:01.120]  technocrats want to do. They want to take our speech. That's right. And again, you're
[54:01.120 --> 54:05.160]  on Twitter with a huge following. What's the best place for people to visit you on Twitter?
[54:05.160 --> 54:10.840]  Ho-Tep, where do they go? Go right to my Twitter. You'll hit the link in my bio and you can
[54:10.840 --> 54:14.800]  sign up to my email list and keep in contact. Stay there. Do 15 more minutes with us and
[54:14.800 --> 54:18.440]  then I got David Knight coming up. David, stay there as well. David Knight, because
[54:18.440 --> 54:23.440]  I want to get into the scene from the White House, the leftist terror operations that
[54:23.440 --> 54:27.720]  the media deny exist in this gaslighting and how we counter that and more with Ho-Tep,
[54:27.720 --> 54:32.080]  Jesus, and David Knight. By the way, DNA Force has been sold out for a long time. The PQQ
[54:32.080 --> 54:36.560]  of the Coquitin, best thing you do for your cells, for your immunity, it's back in stock,
[54:36.560 --> 54:43.560]  50% off, trod for shipping, for paying your points. It's our new sale. DNA Force is back.
[54:43.560 --> 54:48.120]  The controlled corporate media are mouthpieces for any big corporation or government that
[54:48.120 --> 54:53.680]  pay them. It's that simple. They've used our open free society against us. The controlled
[54:53.680 --> 54:57.160]  media will talk about a few mistakes I've made over the years and obsess over it. They
[54:57.160 --> 55:02.400]  see he's a liar on purpose, even though our success rate, our accuracy rate is way, way
[55:02.400 --> 55:07.440]  better than theirs. We try to tell the truth. They try to lie. They try to deceive. I'm
[55:07.440 --> 55:11.840]  trying to get people to realize that the globalists operate and how they manipulate, how they
[55:11.840 --> 55:17.560]  bamboozle the public. I'm trying to get the public to ask some questions and to not believe
[55:17.560 --> 55:23.760]  what they're told in the face. I'm trying to get people to research for themselves.
[55:23.760 --> 55:28.080]  The globalists and their controlled corporate press say that researching and not trusting
[55:28.080 --> 55:34.320]  media is evil and is a conspiracy theory. But again, on its face, that is a fraud. Question
[55:34.320 --> 55:38.440]  everything, question info wars, add your own research to it and then decide what you're
[55:38.440 --> 55:42.440]  going to promote to others and what new sources are accurate. I believe info wars is the best
[55:42.440 --> 55:50.360]  source out there. Info wars has been reporting on the dark, unpleasant truths of big government
[55:50.360 --> 55:56.760]  corruption for over two decades. It is why they attack us and it is why we are now the
[55:56.760 --> 56:03.400]  most banned broadcast in the world. The Hunter Biden hard drive scandal is merely the tip
[56:03.400 --> 56:09.240]  of the iceberg. Evil has infested governments everywhere, but the evil establishment is
[56:09.240 --> 56:15.720]  censoring content across all media platforms. They blocked you from sharing banned dot video
[56:15.720 --> 56:22.920]  on social media. So go to election night dot news and share it like your lives depended
[56:22.920 --> 56:31.720]  on it. Go to election night dot news to find the truth about COVID vaccines, Bill Gates
[56:31.720 --> 56:38.680]  and big pharma. Go to election night dot news to find all the information the crooked establishment
[56:38.680 --> 56:49.400]  is most afraid of. Go to election night dot news and share now. You're listening to the
[56:49.400 --> 57:11.240]  Alex Jones show. You won't get what you're after till the day you die. Well, you're just not
[57:11.240 --> 57:25.720]  going to get what you're after until the day I die or until you start spreading the link
[57:25.720 --> 57:35.560]  to info wars.com. We already figured out what works. You know what's real. Since when have
[57:35.560 --> 57:42.840]  you seen Amish campaigning politically? They're not stupid. This is a short segment long segment
[57:42.840 --> 57:46.520]  coming up. Hotep Jesus brought more truth bombs on us. Next time we're next to get to that
[57:46.520 --> 57:50.560]  video I talked about with the sunshine group. It's really obviously behind BLM and more
[57:50.560 --> 57:55.400]  of it. Federal workers, that's the actual brains of this saying they're going to launch
[57:55.400 --> 57:59.600]  this takeover, attack the White House, come up government. What else other than false
[57:59.600 --> 58:03.000]  flags are you looking at here?
[58:03.000 --> 58:08.760]  I just looked at Trump Twitter account just now and Nigerians are parading for Trump,
[58:08.760 --> 58:15.000]  which is amazing. Three things I want to touch on. Number one, buy gold. If you haven't bought
[58:15.000 --> 58:20.600]  gold buy, I just sold an option contract this morning. Maybe I sold too early. I don't know.
[58:20.600 --> 58:25.040]  Big spike. I made a bag of money this week. You are right. There is an energetic war.
[58:25.040 --> 58:31.480]  They want to steal your energy. So you are focused on their agenda and not your home
[58:31.480 --> 58:39.680]  agenda, your family agenda and your life. Here's something else. JP Morgan has created
[58:39.680 --> 58:47.600]  JP coin. So they are moving into the digital currency realm and they are coming with that
[58:47.600 --> 58:52.120]  one world currency and the banks are going to start uniting around blockchain. So it's
[58:52.120 --> 58:55.200]  also something else we got to worry about is what's going to happen with the money and
[58:55.200 --> 58:58.320]  that's exactly why I say we're going to have to start buying gold and I think buying gold
[58:58.320 --> 59:02.880]  or bullion, the actual physical gold is a very big. I said two years ago, get back into
[59:02.880 --> 59:06.560]  gold and I'm the evil Alex Jones. We can't even get a good gold sponsor. I get a bunch
[59:06.560 --> 59:10.120]  of fly by nights, but I can't get a good one. So I don't even have one. And I'm like, I
[59:10.120 --> 59:12.640]  told people you better get into gold and it's up, you know, a couple of hundred percent
[59:12.640 --> 59:19.240]  here. You know, last week we had the IMF actually two weeks ago, we had the IMF meeting with
[59:19.240 --> 59:24.240]  several central bankers, including Pau, the Federal Reserve, and they titled it the new
[59:24.240 --> 59:28.320]  Bretton Woods. And you know, the first Bretton Woods, the resets here, they admit the whole
[59:28.320 --> 59:32.120]  damn thing. The left is parading for the end of the dollar, which will destroy the average
[59:32.120 --> 59:33.120]  American.
[59:33.120 --> 59:35.800]  I know we're, we're denouncing conspiracy theorists because we say they're, they're
[59:35.800 --> 59:39.680]  holding back physical currency from us as well as physical coins, but they're talking
[59:39.680 --> 59:43.160]  about the cashless stuff. They're talking about it coming very quickly. Bank of America's
[59:43.160 --> 59:47.680]  chief investment analyst came out and said, invest in inflation assets. And so we're going
[59:47.680 --> 59:52.480]  to see massive devaluation. This is Bank of America giving investment advice. So this
[59:52.480 --> 59:58.400]  is part of it. And as a hotep was saying, this is about the cashless society. It all
[59:58.400 --> 1:00:03.520]  goes back to the ID to ID 2020. I talked yesterday about, oh, this is a collapsing the system
[1:00:03.520 --> 1:00:07.200]  to roll in and they don't want us to tell people what they're about to do because that'll
[1:00:07.200 --> 1:00:11.640]  add to our credibility and point out they're the ones screwing us over to vertically integrate.
[1:00:11.640 --> 1:00:12.640]  That's right.
[1:00:12.640 --> 1:00:16.120]  Everything, which is what the lockdown has only helped like 50 corporations and after
[1:00:16.120 --> 1:00:18.720]  everybody else hotel. How do we counter that?
[1:00:18.720 --> 1:00:23.600]  Man, uh, we got to keep doing what you're doing. We got to keep talking. We got to keep
[1:00:23.600 --> 1:00:27.560]  having these broadcasts. We can't let them shut us down. Here's one thing I want to point
[1:00:27.560 --> 1:00:32.360]  out because what they're using against us is our ignorance. For example, with this whole
[1:00:32.360 --> 1:00:39.360]  COVID thing, what they say, I just saw a report said flu was down 98% this year. It just magically
[1:00:39.360 --> 1:00:42.920]  disappeared. How? How was that possible?
[1:00:42.920 --> 1:00:45.720]  They moved the column over. You were on six months ago and said that.
[1:00:45.720 --> 1:00:51.600]  Yes. They're, they're misdiagnosing people all across the board. If you come in and you
[1:00:51.600 --> 1:00:56.600]  fall off your skateboard, you got COVID. They are depending on our ignorance. I have a new
[1:00:56.600 --> 1:01:01.080]  book coming out. That'll be out in a few weeks before I go see Tim Pool, but we have to keep
[1:01:01.080 --> 1:01:04.520]  spreading the word. We have to keep talking. We have to keep educating. We cannot.
[1:01:04.520 --> 1:01:08.080]  Tim Pool wants me on, maybe we should do it. I don't want to jump into what you're doing,
[1:01:08.080 --> 1:01:11.920]  but maybe do a couple podcasts. Maybe I'll do one with you, but I'm in Maryland. So
[1:01:11.920 --> 1:01:15.840]  maybe, so after you're done with him and I do him, we should probably hook up.
[1:01:15.840 --> 1:01:20.640]  Yeah, let's collab. Let's do it, bro. I'm totally down with that. That's what the people
[1:01:20.640 --> 1:01:21.640]  need, man.
[1:01:21.640 --> 1:01:24.120]  Absolutely. We're going to go to break one more segment. I want to just keep hitting
[1:01:24.120 --> 1:01:27.000]  this. I want to get into the violence, though, and how we responded to this and how we counter
[1:01:27.000 --> 1:01:32.320]  it with what the left's about to do. And again, it's true to Carlson says, Trump's anti-establishment
[1:01:32.320 --> 1:01:36.440]  folks. I mean, the whole establishment does not want this, but if we have, we, the people
[1:01:36.440 --> 1:01:39.640]  like a Declaration of Independence says they cannot stop us. That's why they're trying
[1:01:39.640 --> 1:01:43.880]  to divide us. Someone talked to HoTep, David Knight. How do we unify ourselves and cut
[1:01:43.880 --> 1:01:48.360]  through all this crap? And what happens if Trump wins and succeeds? How does he then go
[1:01:48.360 --> 1:01:52.960]  after these guys?
[1:01:52.960 --> 1:01:57.440]  Two in four wars best selling products are now back in stock for being sold out for months.
[1:01:57.440 --> 1:02:02.640]  Biotree Selenium from the mustard seed, essential in all electrochemical activity of the cells
[1:02:02.640 --> 1:02:07.920]  in the body. That's every human activity. And on top of it, body's ultimate turmeric
[1:02:07.920 --> 1:02:14.760]  formula with 95% or synchicuminoid. Lady competitors have three to 5%. The things that turmeric
[1:02:14.760 --> 1:02:18.440]  does, I don't have to tell you, this is the highest quality, the strongest you're gonna
[1:02:18.440 --> 1:02:23.320]  find. So both of these are amazing products, and they fund the infill war, which is a 360
[1:02:23.320 --> 1:02:27.680]  win. On top of it, despite the fact they're in demand, they've been sold out for months,
[1:02:27.680 --> 1:02:34.800]  they're both 50% off triple patriot points and free shipping at infowarstore.com. That's
[1:02:34.800 --> 1:02:41.080]  bio true selenium from the mustard seed. It's amazing. And on top of it, we also have bodies
[1:02:41.080 --> 1:02:46.960]  ultimate turmeric formula at infowarstore.com. This cell will not last long. But thank you
[1:02:46.960 --> 1:02:50.000]  all for your support. We really need to try these products. People absolutely love them
[1:02:50.000 --> 1:03:07.280]  because they really, really work infowarstore.com. The new world order knew that info wars had
[1:03:07.280 --> 1:03:11.240]  their number. They knew that you had their number. And they knew that once they launched
[1:03:11.240 --> 1:03:16.160]  their operations, we couldn't be on air because our credibility would be too high. But because
[1:03:16.160 --> 1:03:21.240]  of you doggedly staying in the fight and spreading the word supporting us, we are still on air
[1:03:21.240 --> 1:03:28.200]  and stronger in many ways than ever. Oh, scarred and punished and battle hardened. We wouldn't
[1:03:28.200 --> 1:03:36.320]  have it any other way. All right, hotep Jesus. Great analyst researcher author is here with
[1:03:36.320 --> 1:03:41.520]  us right now. David Knights riding shot done one more segment than Trump is live as campaign
[1:03:41.520 --> 1:03:46.520]  headquarters. We stopped it. We'll play that next segment ahead of David Ike. But getting
[1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:51.600]  into the violence. Let's play this clip that David introduced this. There's hours of this
[1:03:51.600 --> 1:03:55.720]  on info wars.com. Really, we were doing a great job months ago for some of the sunshine
[1:03:55.720 --> 1:03:59.960]  group. That's just another Soros funding group event. This is the academics. This is the
[1:03:59.960 --> 1:04:05.920]  federal workers. This is the intelligence ops above black lives matter and above Antifa.
[1:04:05.920 --> 1:04:09.920]  And there's just hours of them how they're going to overthrow things and shut the government
[1:04:09.920 --> 1:04:13.960]  down and how they're going to mess up the voting so it goes longer. I mean, this is
[1:04:13.960 --> 1:04:18.720]  very seditious crap. Oh, yeah. And they're they're right. And I would say obviously they're
[1:04:18.720 --> 1:04:22.360]  over the line talking about how it's a coup. And we know it's a coup. But they're saying
[1:04:22.360 --> 1:04:26.440]  that it's Trump who's doing a coup. It's the people who voted for Trump that are doing
[1:04:26.440 --> 1:04:31.120]  a coup against them because you understand they see themselves as the real government
[1:04:31.120 --> 1:04:35.080]  just like Bernie Sanders when President Trump did a tax cut. Remember, he was like, you're
[1:04:35.080 --> 1:04:39.920]  looting the treasury. They think all of your money belongs to them. They think they are
[1:04:39.920 --> 1:04:44.760]  the government. And if anybody votes somebody out that doesn't that supports them and votes
[1:04:44.760 --> 1:04:48.720]  on somebody who opposes what they're doing, that's a coup against them because they're
[1:04:48.720 --> 1:04:52.960]  the entrenched government. So they're talking about how they can slow walk things, how they
[1:04:52.960 --> 1:04:58.800]  can deliberately delay things, how they can subvert the elected officials. And that's
[1:04:58.800 --> 1:05:02.240]  really what's going on. And they all act and look like lunatics. They're running a they're
[1:05:02.240 --> 1:05:09.200]  running a election watch at the Black Lives Matter Center there in Washington, DC. And
[1:05:09.200 --> 1:05:12.120]  they're being directed by the Democrats, they say we're going to say we're holding up a
[1:05:12.120 --> 1:05:15.840]  few days, but really it's months till he's driven out that they're it's the battle
[1:05:15.840 --> 1:05:22.240]  plans. That's right. So let's play a clip of it. Here it is. Let's talk about what actions
[1:05:22.240 --> 1:05:28.160]  and decisions are in your immediate sphere of influence as somebody who works in the
[1:05:28.160 --> 1:05:34.640]  government. I'm a management and programs analyst. I work in the national security community.
[1:05:34.640 --> 1:05:43.840]  I spent three and a half years as a contractor at DHS HQ. The mainstream press like they
[1:05:43.840 --> 1:05:49.240]  all have signal accounts, text them, leak everything you can. The journalists I've dealt
[1:05:49.240 --> 1:05:55.440]  with have been super ethical in ways to shield me, the source of the leaks. Groups on the
[1:05:55.440 --> 1:06:02.480]  outside being able to show solidarity with federal workers, making sure that we're naming
[1:06:02.480 --> 1:06:08.040]  what is happening as a coup. Totally agreed in that I found BC conversations that I have
[1:06:08.040 --> 1:06:12.800]  been that's not on the federal side. We also are often saying that you call it a coup.
[1:06:12.800 --> 1:06:19.560]  It's a coup. Don't let anyone tell you it's not. So on average, these are white mental
[1:06:19.560 --> 1:06:25.040]  patients who want power and they don't want to work for it. They just want to go join
[1:06:25.040 --> 1:06:28.880]  the chai comms and the globalist and have a coup and then they project and say we're
[1:06:28.880 --> 1:06:35.840]  doing the coup. I'm just sorry. A feminine, weak, chicken-necked, shifty-eyed. I would
[1:06:35.840 --> 1:06:40.160]  not associate just on the face with any of these people. They all act and behave disingenuous.
[1:06:40.160 --> 1:06:44.320]  They're traders on video, but then they say we're the bad guys because they have a permanent
[1:06:44.320 --> 1:06:52.040]  chip on their shoulder day but night. Their power is red tape. They really have sown the
[1:06:52.040 --> 1:06:57.640]  seeds of the collapse of the empire. Every empire eventually collapses of corruption,
[1:06:57.640 --> 1:07:01.840]  classification from the bureaucracy, the Byzantine aspect of this.
[1:07:01.840 --> 1:07:02.840]  The whips take over.
[1:07:02.840 --> 1:07:09.440]  Exactly. That's what these people represent. They represent a self-serving corrupt power
[1:07:09.440 --> 1:07:13.720]  elite who have taken over control from everybody else and that's the way empires fall and you
[1:07:13.720 --> 1:07:20.080]  heard who these people work for. I mean, these are high-ranking officials. These are people
[1:07:20.080 --> 1:07:23.800]  who are in the department. DHS, intelligence agencies, and they all look like mental patients.
[1:07:23.800 --> 1:07:24.800]  That's right.
[1:07:24.800 --> 1:07:28.240]  And here's the thing. They're cutting everyone off because they don't want anyone to have
[1:07:28.240 --> 1:07:32.000]  any connection to reality because that's power. And so we don't want power. We just want
[1:07:32.000 --> 1:07:35.680]  to be free, but they literally want to black everybody out where no one can communicate
[1:07:35.680 --> 1:07:39.320]  and then that makes things collapse and they're on their little island as the water's rising
[1:07:39.320 --> 1:07:42.720]  and they go take more freedom, take more freedom. All you got to do is give people freedom.
[1:07:42.720 --> 1:07:46.600]  They love you, you dumb people, but they don't get that. It's like Trump said, you think
[1:07:46.600 --> 1:07:50.720]  COVID scares everyone to not go vote? You dumb bastards. Hotep, this is crazy. What do
[1:07:50.720 --> 1:07:51.720]  you make of it?
[1:07:51.720 --> 1:07:57.240]  Yeah. So what they want to do is they want to take power away from the president. They
[1:07:57.240 --> 1:08:02.120]  want to take power away from Trump and they can do so legally under the federal emergency
[1:08:02.120 --> 1:08:07.520]  management agency, aka FEMA. And I believe this was under Nixon and what they have are
[1:08:07.520 --> 1:08:14.160]  several executive orders here. Executive order 1099 and 10995 provides for the takeover of
[1:08:14.160 --> 1:08:21.360]  communications. 10997 provides for the takeover of all electric power, petroleum, gas, fuels
[1:08:21.360 --> 1:08:29.600]  and minerals. Another one here, takeover of food resources. That's 10988. 10999, takeover
[1:08:29.600 --> 1:08:36.920]  of all transportation, highways and seaports, 1100, mobilization of all citizens into work
[1:08:36.920 --> 1:08:41.800]  brigades under the government supervision. Work brigades, doesn't that sound like communist
[1:08:41.800 --> 1:08:49.440]  gulags? 11001 provides for takeover of health, education and welfare functions. So that sounds
[1:08:49.440 --> 1:08:55.800]  like green new deal and more, what does it call it? Healthcare, right? More socialist
[1:08:55.800 --> 1:09:01.120]  communist stuff. We're talking about 11002, takeover of the postmaster general. They're
[1:09:01.120 --> 1:09:06.080]  going to control our mail. They can control the airports and the aircraft services through
[1:09:06.080 --> 1:09:07.080]  11003.
[1:09:07.080 --> 1:09:10.520]  And they can even suspend Congress and then all those have been re-upped. One of Trump's
[1:09:10.520 --> 1:09:15.760]  big failures is he needs to revise and revert. But none of his advisors have told him each
[1:09:15.760 --> 1:09:18.960]  president overrides the old executive orders. But those that HOTEP talks about have been
[1:09:18.960 --> 1:09:24.200]  brought forward by Clinton, by Obama and even made stronger. Trump needs to rescind those
[1:09:24.200 --> 1:09:26.320]  things now, today, before the election.
[1:09:26.320 --> 1:09:30.040]  He needs to stop this Operation Warp Speed vaccine program because this is being run
[1:09:30.040 --> 1:09:34.300]  by the military. Yesterday, I showed a document just about the Moderna contract where they
[1:09:34.300 --> 1:09:40.120]  have an option versus 100 million doses, but they go up to 500 million doses. And it
[1:09:40.120 --> 1:09:46.720]  was a 53-page document, Alex, and virtually all of it was redacted. We have only one
[1:09:46.720 --> 1:09:51.200]  official out of the FDA is allowed to even look at what's going on with Operation Warp
[1:09:51.200 --> 1:09:55.760]  Speed. The rest of the people are kept out of this compartmentalized, redacted thing
[1:09:55.760 --> 1:09:58.040]  that's being run by the military in DARPA.
[1:09:58.040 --> 1:09:59.040]  And we need to understand-
[1:09:59.040 --> 1:10:02.040]  Trump didn't take control from Gates. That's what Gates is pissed. But I agree. It becomes
[1:10:02.040 --> 1:10:03.040]  a son monster.
[1:10:03.040 --> 1:10:06.600]  Well, it is a bomb. It is a bomb that is there for somebody to use.
[1:10:06.600 --> 1:10:07.600]  Absolutely.
[1:10:07.600 --> 1:10:12.880]  And we saw this COVID thing coming here. I had Dr. Shivo on my channel. We were talking
[1:10:12.880 --> 1:10:18.680]  about how they were taking away vaccine exemptions. You could not- or religious exemption of surrounding
[1:10:18.680 --> 1:10:24.520]  vaccines here in New Jersey. They are making the vaccines mandatory. And this was pre-COVID.
[1:10:24.520 --> 1:10:28.120]  This is pre-COVID. We were fighting this thing. So they were preparing to take away
[1:10:28.120 --> 1:10:36.240]  our rights to deny the vaccine before the COVID hit. And now we have this Warp Speed
[1:10:36.240 --> 1:10:41.480]  of the vaccine coming. So let's just know this thing was imposed a long time ago.
[1:10:41.480 --> 1:10:45.040]  And the UN came out December and said vaccines are killing people. They're not helping them.
[1:10:45.040 --> 1:10:48.520]  Our doctors don't believe in it. And then magically, all of this gets launched. I want
[1:10:48.520 --> 1:10:52.560]  to play this clip, though, because Attorney General Barr, who is not perfect, I got problems
[1:10:52.560 --> 1:10:56.800]  with him, he said, since slavery, we've had nothing as big as the COVID lockdown. And
[1:10:56.800 --> 1:11:01.200]  the media made jokes and said he's belittling slavery in America. No one is. When your business
[1:11:01.200 --> 1:11:05.720]  goes out, you commit suicide. You can't leave your house. You got to wear a mask over your
[1:11:05.720 --> 1:11:10.000]  face. And he hasn't done anything to stop it. But what I'm saying is this is the closest
[1:11:10.000 --> 1:11:14.840]  thing to slavery we've seen. This is slavery, to say you're non-essential. Here, let's go
[1:11:14.840 --> 1:11:19.000]  ahead and play the clip.
[1:11:19.000 --> 1:11:26.960]  Putting a national lockdown stay-at-home orders is like house arrest. It's other than slavery,
[1:11:26.960 --> 1:11:31.000]  which was a different kind of restraint. This is the greatest intrusion on civil liberties
[1:11:31.000 --> 1:11:36.360]  in American history. Okay, that's a completely, I brought that up because we're out of time,
[1:11:36.360 --> 1:11:39.920]  heroin. You can join us again tonight, tomorrow. But that's exactly what you're talking about.
[1:11:39.920 --> 1:11:44.960]  This is gulags. This is martial law. This is communist China that dictated this. Yes,
[1:11:44.960 --> 1:11:50.760]  that's exactly what it is. People buy ammo, buy guns. And as a backup, we have to get
[1:11:50.760 --> 1:11:58.240]  technologically smart and get some 3D printers and be able to print our weapons if need be.
[1:11:58.240 --> 1:12:01.920]  Because that's exactly what we're going to need after they take our freedom of speech,
[1:12:01.920 --> 1:12:05.560]  after they try and take our guns, and after these leftists try to invade our homes and
[1:12:05.560 --> 1:12:09.560]  our communities, after Trump wins tonight.
[1:12:09.560 --> 1:12:14.400]  HotepNation.com. Hotep, thank you so much. Look forward to you popping back in tonight.
[1:12:14.400 --> 1:12:17.040]  Maybe late tonight if you can do it. You're doing your own live stream after you're done.
[1:12:17.040 --> 1:12:19.400]  Join us again tomorrow. Thank you so much, sir.
[1:12:19.400 --> 1:12:21.480]  It's a pleasure, man. Great to have me. Thank you.
[1:12:21.480 --> 1:12:25.520]  You're awesome. And that's why I wanted to get him on. I wanted to cover all that stuff
[1:12:25.520 --> 1:12:30.000]  about the false flag and about everything. And he just said it all, so I'm glad. You'll
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:34.200]  be back tonight at 6 o'clock, close to an hour. That's a special guest, Matt Bracken.
[1:12:34.200 --> 1:12:38.000]  Yes, we're going to talk about how to defend yourself and your family and your community,
[1:12:38.000 --> 1:12:39.000]  your neighborhood.
[1:12:39.000 --> 1:12:45.040]  All right, the live feeds are live. Infowars.com, boards last show. And of course, electionnight.news,
[1:12:45.040 --> 1:12:51.080]  electionnight.news, electionnight.news. Donald Trump coming up next.
[1:12:51.080 --> 1:12:56.280]  Much of the time on big issues and societal developments, Infowars is many, many years
[1:12:56.280 --> 1:13:02.280]  ahead. And almost all the time we are tomorrow's news today, but there's a blind spot that
[1:13:02.280 --> 1:13:06.560]  Infowars has. I've noticed that really informed people have this as well. And I know a lot
[1:13:06.560 --> 1:13:10.840]  of you tuning in are some of the most performable out there. So I want you to be retrospective
[1:13:10.840 --> 1:13:13.880]  and kind of examine yourself because that's what I do every day.
[1:13:13.880 --> 1:13:20.160]  This Hunterbyte laptop is important, but the new audio confirmed to be him, where he admits
[1:13:20.160 --> 1:13:24.840]  he works under the Communist Chinese spy sheaf. He should be arrested right now. That
[1:13:24.840 --> 1:13:31.800]  is so huge. That is hiding in plain view. And it's getting almost no attention. We
[1:13:31.800 --> 1:13:37.040]  have to get that information out to everybody. It's all posted on Infowars.com, so many other
[1:13:37.040 --> 1:13:42.160]  major patriotic sites, but we need to get it out to everybody and remember that we know
[1:13:42.160 --> 1:13:46.480]  all of this. We knew it a long time ago. So when it breaks now, we kind of go, okay, tell
[1:13:46.480 --> 1:13:51.040]  us that we didn't know the point is now it's documented. Now it's proven. We're only here
[1:13:51.040 --> 1:13:56.200]  on air facing the globalist onslaughts, the DMC funded lawsuits and everything that's
[1:13:56.200 --> 1:14:00.880]  happening because of you. We built the only truly multimedia independent radio TV print
[1:14:00.880 --> 1:14:04.720]  film organization in the world that promotes the truth against the globalist. We've had
[1:14:04.720 --> 1:14:09.360]  a devastating effect. We're a national treasure. You're a national treasure for supporting us.
[1:14:09.360 --> 1:14:14.200]  And so go get a t shirt. Go get a historic t shirt. We've got a funny one that's the
[1:14:14.200 --> 1:14:18.080]  Biden groping a woman. It's, it's a woman's design shirt. My wife really likes it. She
[1:14:18.080 --> 1:14:21.040]  sent me this gift. It's pretty cute. Here it is. And it just, you know, it's a little
[1:14:21.040 --> 1:14:24.520]  historic thing. I think Trump's not a win, but if Biden's able to steal it, we'll be
[1:14:24.520 --> 1:14:27.920]  probably shut down pretty quick. So it'll be historic thing to have. You only be able
[1:14:27.920 --> 1:14:32.040]  to fight them in the third dimension on the street with graffiti, with handbills you
[1:14:32.040 --> 1:14:36.400]  hand out and with noncompliance, not paying taxes and pulling your kids out of the schools
[1:14:36.400 --> 1:14:41.200]  and just making it a full time job to expose and fight and obstruct the criminal foreign
[1:14:41.200 --> 1:14:45.120]  takeover of America. We've gotten to that point. Biden for nursing home. I hope to
[1:14:45.120 --> 1:14:48.560]  retire Biden. That'd be a collector's item. Get it while you still can. We're not ordering
[1:14:48.560 --> 1:14:53.720]  more info or store.com.
[1:14:53.720 --> 1:15:05.520]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:05.520 --> 1:15:11.720]  There isn't just evil in the universe. There isn't just betrayal. And we're seeing that
[1:15:11.720 --> 1:15:19.440]  right now. It's election 2020. Wild horses could not drag me away. David Ike in the middle
[1:15:19.440 --> 1:15:24.880]  of the second lockdown that starts in just a few days in England already started in France.
[1:15:24.880 --> 1:15:30.880]  He's going to be joining us. We're very excited about that. He said like 30,000, 40,000 people
[1:15:30.880 --> 1:15:34.360]  show up at huge events they've been doing. They're trying to arrest the leadership. It's
[1:15:34.360 --> 1:15:40.040]  been insane. This is the global government takeover. It's here. It's just it's insane
[1:15:40.040 --> 1:15:43.560]  that they actually implemented what they said they would implement. What's in Rockefeller
[1:15:43.560 --> 1:15:47.160]  white papers and Bill Gates white papers, man, is what they're going to do. And they
[1:15:47.160 --> 1:15:50.960]  talk later about super weapons are going to be released and kill almost everybody. I'm
[1:15:50.960 --> 1:15:54.560]  not going to just sit there and take it. And I'm going to expose who's behind it. I know
[1:15:54.560 --> 1:15:58.360]  you are as well. That's coming up next segment. Thank you so much for joining us. I'm Alex
[1:15:58.360 --> 1:16:03.440]  Jones, your host. This is the reality. People are now figuring out we weren't making this
[1:16:03.440 --> 1:16:08.720]  stuff up. It's real. Here's what President Trump just said about 15 minutes ago at his
[1:16:08.720 --> 1:16:14.760]  campaign headquarters. Here it is. We had some incredible rallies and incredible times.
[1:16:14.760 --> 1:16:19.760]  And I hear we're doing very well in Florida and we're doing very well in Arizona. We're
[1:16:19.760 --> 1:16:25.720]  doing incredibly well in Texas. We're doing, I think we're doing, I'm hearing we're doing
[1:16:25.720 --> 1:16:31.280]  well all over. I hear the lines are amazing. The lines have been amazing. And I think we're
[1:16:31.280 --> 1:16:34.600]  going to have a great night. We're going to have a great night. And we're going to have
[1:16:34.600 --> 1:16:39.080]  much more importantly, we're going to have a great four years. But I want to thank everybody
[1:16:39.080 --> 1:16:43.040]  is a tremendous group of people. Come on over here. Let's this is the media. They're
[1:16:43.040 --> 1:16:54.240]  very nice. They dream assisted. Young attractive people that no politics and someday some of
[1:16:54.240 --> 1:16:59.320]  the people in this room, I predict some of them will be president, I hope, but they've
[1:16:59.320 --> 1:17:04.000]  been working very hard. And I know you'll be here all night. And I think you're going
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:10.320]  to see some tremendous results. And you know, we had rallies that was loved at those rallies.
[1:17:10.320 --> 1:17:14.320]  And there's never been rallies like that. There has never been. And I say it in front
[1:17:14.320 --> 1:17:19.840]  of the media and they can check it. They can fact check it if they want. But there's never
[1:17:19.840 --> 1:17:27.000]  been anything like we just had. And I think a combination of the debate, maybe the debates,
[1:17:27.000 --> 1:17:33.160]  but the debate, certainly the second debate and the rallies were, it was a good combination.
[1:17:33.160 --> 1:17:38.400]  And we really, I think we took off. So it's been really good. I want to just thank everybody
[1:17:38.400 --> 1:17:44.280]  in the room. You see these people, we travel with these people. They're extremely nice.
[1:17:44.280 --> 1:17:47.920]  And they respect very much what we've done. Actually, I think they do. If you want to
[1:17:47.920 --> 1:17:55.640]  know the truth, I think they do. Yeah, please. I feel very good. After doing that many rallies,
[1:17:55.640 --> 1:18:02.680]  they've always gets a little bit choppy, I think. God did not design it for that much.
[1:18:02.680 --> 1:18:07.080]  But we, you know, look, we did a lot of them. We did actually six the last day because one
[1:18:07.080 --> 1:18:12.240]  finished at two in the morning. So I put it on. So we did five plus sort of one, but we
[1:18:12.240 --> 1:18:18.440]  did a lot. And great job, President Trump exciting times. David likes coming up. But
[1:18:18.440 --> 1:18:24.000]  here is a short little clip where just a few hours ago, I went and voted in South Austin.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:28.040]  And it was very easy. The folks were very, very nice. It was a receipt. I liked that.
[1:18:28.040 --> 1:18:31.880]  And so that's why they're so scared and trying to do it at the ballot level fraud with the
[1:18:31.880 --> 1:18:35.840]  mail-ins. That's where the real fraud is going down. But here is that special report. We'll
[1:18:35.840 --> 1:18:36.840]  be back with David.
[1:18:36.840 --> 1:18:47.640]  Well, the big day is here, November 3rd, 2020, hands down the most important election in
[1:18:47.640 --> 1:18:52.480]  modern history, probably in world history, a referendum against globalism against tyranny
[1:18:52.480 --> 1:18:56.400]  and against our really corrupt, evil ruling class that believes this country shouldn't
[1:18:56.400 --> 1:18:57.400]  even exist.
[1:18:57.400 --> 1:19:01.800]  Dr. Carlson, we said that last night, has never said words truer. So I'm driving over
[1:19:01.800 --> 1:19:06.400]  here to a local spot, one of these smaller polling places to vote. If I won't wear a
[1:19:06.400 --> 1:19:11.200]  mask, the state law says I've got to drive around the back here, all part of this COVID
[1:19:11.200 --> 1:19:15.120]  theater trying to keep folks from voting. And I'm going to vote straight Republican ticket
[1:19:15.120 --> 1:19:18.000]  except now they don't have that on the computers. They've changed it. We've got to go right
[1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:22.720]  down the line and vote on each person. I'm still going to be voting a straight Republican
[1:19:22.720 --> 1:19:26.200]  ticket. I would not vote for a Democrat if they had a gun to my head. They are now an
[1:19:26.200 --> 1:19:31.320]  un-American criminal party literally sworn to end the nation and absorb us into world
[1:19:31.320 --> 1:19:34.280]  government as common as China is the model.
[1:19:34.280 --> 1:19:37.040]  Now Joe Biden came out today and so we thought he was going to do. He's going to declare
[1:19:37.040 --> 1:19:40.360]  himself the winner and have the media declare him the winner tonight. This is going to be
[1:19:40.360 --> 1:19:45.120]  very, very serious. If Trump can test it anyway, they're calling him a dictator. So this country's
[1:19:45.120 --> 1:19:50.640]  in great peril and I normally can handle stress. I'm literally having anxiety attack
[1:19:50.640 --> 1:19:57.480]  today over this. This is the country completely and totally and absolutely on the line.
[1:19:57.480 --> 1:20:03.120]  Hi, how you doing? Good, good, good. We're not doing the COVID theater deals. We'd like
[1:20:03.120 --> 1:20:05.760]  to vote out here. Perfect. Yes, thank you.
[1:20:05.760 --> 1:20:12.520]  I never believed it would be this much in jeopardy. We launched our campaign over on
[1:20:12.520 --> 1:20:19.920]  the oval back in May 2019. But you know what I said then, we've been through a lot since
[1:20:19.920 --> 1:20:20.920]  then.
[1:20:20.920 --> 1:20:30.920]  The zombie apocalypse is real, ladies and gentlemen. Seriously, I'm joking around about
[1:20:30.920 --> 1:20:34.520]  a lot of this. This is deadly serious. Our country's been put into a form of soft martial
[1:20:34.520 --> 1:20:40.520]  law and even if Trump tries to lift it, the corporations, the universities, the blue
[1:20:40.520 --> 1:20:44.760]  states, the blue cities are saying the lockdown never ends. This is siege against the country.
[1:20:44.760 --> 1:20:49.360]  Oh, communist China. Remember them? They're wide open for business because they had a draconian
[1:20:49.360 --> 1:20:53.160]  lockdown and then fixed the virus, which of course they did. It's all made up. But as
[1:20:53.160 --> 1:20:57.560]  the testing goes up, the number of COVID cases go up, but the deaths don't go up because
[1:20:57.560 --> 1:21:01.760]  they were putting the deaths of flu and pneumonia in the list. And I know you all know that.
[1:21:01.760 --> 1:21:06.120]  And all these scientists have come out, including Fauci in a paper he wrote in 2008 and said
[1:21:06.120 --> 1:21:14.560]  the main cause of death in the Spanish flu was bacterial pneumonia from the mask. Hi,
[1:21:14.560 --> 1:21:17.880]  how are you doing? I am voting group side. Thank you.
[1:21:17.880 --> 1:21:24.680]  Can I see your driver's license event? The one the only.
[1:21:24.680 --> 1:21:51.160]  Are you still on this? I am. I need you to sign here. I can't. I accept.
[1:21:51.160 --> 1:21:58.040]  Thank you. I'm glad folks, I'm glad folks bucked the system because they were making
[1:21:58.040 --> 1:22:01.760]  it where masks can go inside. But if people bucked it, now they do this outside. And notice
[1:22:01.760 --> 1:22:05.760]  we have to sign for this. We have to do this because Texas is trying to block the fraud
[1:22:05.760 --> 1:22:09.960]  that at least 16 Democrat states, they just give drivers license to illegal aliens, lines
[1:22:09.960 --> 1:22:24.440]  up around the block as you saw in New Yorkers this year, and then they're allowed to go
[1:22:24.440 --> 1:22:30.160]  vote. We're going to be covering this live with 24 hour coverage at election night.news.
[1:22:30.160 --> 1:22:34.160]  That's the new URL because they blocked Band-Aid video and all the big platforms starting
[1:22:34.160 --> 1:22:38.080]  with Twitter. And then they blocked 2020ElectionCenter.com. We've had the last few months, but not before
[1:22:38.080 --> 1:22:42.120]  you spread it and we were getting an extra 5, 10 million views a day spreading the word
[1:22:42.120 --> 1:23:03.800]  because of you. You want to fight, you've got one. Ha ha, 2020, November 3rd. We now take
[1:23:03.800 --> 1:23:12.760]  on the front lines of the information war. It's Alex Jones. All right, David, I get straight
[1:23:12.760 --> 1:23:17.160]  ahead. He's in the front lines of the fight against the lockdown. The global government
[1:23:17.160 --> 1:23:26.360]  UN directed lockdown. We are inside of it. Wow. And so many other big guests coming up.
[1:23:26.360 --> 1:23:31.360]  We have the video coming up. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff tells TV news anchors,
[1:23:31.360 --> 1:23:35.160]  military won't intervene in election, but the big news is Biden's announced the media
[1:23:35.160 --> 1:23:38.760]  is going to announce him the winner tonight. That's what he's saying. Wow. What are we going
[1:23:38.760 --> 1:23:44.480]  to do about that? This is crazy town. The zombie media hadn't figured out. Nobody believes
[1:23:44.480 --> 1:23:52.640]  them anymore. What are they dumb bastards going to do now? It's all on record. Yale, Harvard,
[1:23:52.640 --> 1:23:58.680]  Princeton, Stanford, they were all hired a year ago and then against six months ago to
[1:23:58.680 --> 1:24:03.720]  war game, how to get the public to stay locked down during a pandemic and how to get the
[1:24:03.720 --> 1:24:08.880]  public to take inoculations. They talk about calling people heroes that do it. They talk
[1:24:08.880 --> 1:24:14.440]  about shaming those that don't. This has all been psychologically tested. It's all been
[1:24:14.440 --> 1:24:18.640]  psychologically prepared. And once they get you to lock down for 15 days, you notice now
[1:24:18.640 --> 1:24:23.480]  they say it's permanent. That's how it works. Oh, just put these handcuffs on. The serial
[1:24:23.480 --> 1:24:28.480]  killer says the woman in the parking lot and everything will be all right. No. Now we've
[1:24:28.480 --> 1:24:33.440]  already put the handcuffs on and we're in the serial killer's van. He's taking us to
[1:24:33.440 --> 1:24:38.920]  his shack in the woods to slowly torture us to death. That's the allegory. We got to bust
[1:24:38.920 --> 1:24:42.960]  out of this thing now. We got to say no now. We got to make a run for it now and we still
[1:24:42.960 --> 1:24:47.280]  can. Once he gets us in that base, but it's going to get a lot, lot worse, folks. So stop
[1:24:47.280 --> 1:24:53.760]  submitting. The miraculous properties of turmeric have been admired, even worshiped for thousands
[1:24:53.760 --> 1:24:59.440]  of years by ancient civilizations. With modern science, we know why turmeric is so popular.
[1:24:59.440 --> 1:25:06.440]  It's antioxidant effect. It's anti-inflammatory effect. Everything it does is simply amazing.
[1:25:06.440 --> 1:25:13.040]  And most turmerics out there are simply food products. They're three to five percent curcuminoid,
[1:25:13.040 --> 1:25:21.240]  but we have body's ultimate turmeric formula with a 95% curcuminoid level. We have other
[1:25:21.240 --> 1:25:25.560]  organic products in there that accelerate it and bring it into the cells of the body.
[1:25:25.560 --> 1:25:29.240]  It's been sold out for months. It's back in stock. And despite that, body's ultimate
[1:25:29.240 --> 1:25:36.120]  turmeric formula at infowarstore.com is 50% off with free shipping and triple patriot

[1:25:46.760 --> 1:25:53.080]  lose, it funds the infowar. It was in the Telecommunications Act of 1996 that all new cell phones would
[1:25:53.080 --> 1:25:59.320]  track your GPS location. I read from the federal law and listeners couldn't believe me because
[1:25:59.320 --> 1:26:04.960]  that was un-American. Now the media admits that almost every app and every company that
[1:26:04.960 --> 1:26:10.240]  are on Apple and on Droids, don't just track your location, but your surfing history, where
[1:26:10.240 --> 1:26:15.920]  you go, who you talk to, your relationships, and they all share the data with each other
[1:26:15.920 --> 1:26:20.800]  of what you're doing on the apps as well, including having apps turn on and listen to
[1:26:20.800 --> 1:26:26.760]  what you're saying, just like Siri or Alexa do, and then putting databases, transcripts
[1:26:26.760 --> 1:26:31.400]  of everything you say into those systems to be saved forever. Your phone is spying on
[1:26:31.400 --> 1:26:36.560]  you and companies are generating secret surveillance scores based on information. This is the Global

[1:27:12.480 --> 1:27:42.400]  Listen, I don't have any illusions about Donald Trump.
[1:27:42.400 --> 1:27:46.760]  I didn't trust him from day one, but I thought the globalist hated him. That was enough,
[1:27:46.760 --> 1:27:50.720]  but I've seen him come through now and I've seen him take control of the vaccine agenda
[1:27:50.720 --> 1:27:55.520]  from Gates and Gates hate him and fouchy attack him. And I've seen the real attacks against
[1:27:55.520 --> 1:28:00.360]  info wars and I've seen Trump now come out and sound like David Ike and say, this is
[1:28:00.360 --> 1:28:06.720]  a fraud. Get over it. This is all a power grab. And now it turns out in the hunt for
[1:28:06.720 --> 1:28:12.360]  virus source, WHO, let China take charge. New York times. What did David Ike say eight
[1:28:12.360 --> 1:28:18.800]  months ago? This is a UN, Bill Gates, World Government, CHICOM takeover for a police state.
[1:28:18.800 --> 1:28:23.920]  And now it's all confirmed and they're announcing endless lockdowns. They're asking people what
[1:28:23.920 --> 1:28:28.560]  they bought at the grocery store in the UK. They're digging through their groceries. They're
[1:28:28.560 --> 1:28:34.240]  blocking up not just like the US seed areas for seeds. That's totally essential, but the
[1:28:34.240 --> 1:28:40.820]  books. So don't just ban certain books, ban all books. This is a giant beta test, a power
[1:28:40.820 --> 1:28:47.080]  grab. So I really appreciate during the middle of the 2020 election, a referendum on globalism
[1:28:47.080 --> 1:28:53.320]  versus Americanism versus human liberty to give David Ike here the floor after a second
[1:28:53.320 --> 1:28:57.760]  big speech where the police attacked as he was finishing and arrested people and charged
[1:28:57.760 --> 1:29:04.080]  some with 10,000 pound fines. I guess that's like $13,000 or whatever for me. This is just
[1:29:04.080 --> 1:29:11.840]  insane. And in Australia, just viciously attacking anti lockdown protests or even wearing
[1:29:11.840 --> 1:29:17.000]  the stupid mask. I mean, this is beyond the Soviet Union or communist China, but there
[1:29:17.000 --> 1:29:22.200]  is pushback. So to give us the latest on this, after having 50, 60,000 people at Trafalgar
[1:29:22.200 --> 1:29:26.480]  Square at the second event, first event at about 30,000, exponentially growing a million
[1:29:26.480 --> 1:29:32.920]  showed up in Berlin and David Ike in the middle of this, this is an epic moment as humanity
[1:29:32.920 --> 1:29:37.480]  stands up and gets off its knees. David Ike, we salute you, David Ike.com. Thank you so
[1:29:37.480 --> 1:29:38.480]  much, my friend.
[1:29:38.480 --> 1:29:39.480]  Pleasure, Alex.
[1:29:39.480 --> 1:29:44.800]  Well, sir, you're here. I could go 1000 directions, but you've got the floor front and center.
[1:29:44.800 --> 1:29:45.800]  What are we dealing with?
[1:29:45.800 --> 1:29:53.480]  Well, first of all, given, you know, the imminent situation in the United States, I've had a
[1:29:53.480 --> 1:30:01.280]  lot of problems with Trump. And I did before he was elected. And I've had some problems
[1:30:01.280 --> 1:30:09.560]  since, not least his, his, basically, I'll do whatever you want to work to Israel. And
[1:30:09.560 --> 1:30:16.680]  I think the lawsuit against Google shouldn't come in the weeks before or even days, really,
[1:30:16.680 --> 1:30:27.200]  before the election, but years ago. But having said all that, the thought of Biden Harris
[1:30:27.200 --> 1:30:31.280]  getting into the White House, and that's all they'll do, of course, he's get into the White
[1:30:31.280 --> 1:30:32.280]  House.
[1:30:32.280 --> 1:30:39.640]  They won't have any control over what comes through them. The America, what's left of
[1:30:39.640 --> 1:30:44.720]  America as we knew it, will be over in a year to two years. And there will be some form
[1:30:44.720 --> 1:30:49.640]  of civil war, I'm sure, because people will be big time pushing back against the extremes
[1:30:49.640 --> 1:30:57.560]  that will come with them. And I think there's going to be a lot of upheaval following this
[1:30:57.560 --> 1:31:02.960]  election result. If, if Trump should win is, I mean, I think that people are starting
[1:31:02.960 --> 1:31:13.520]  to prepare for it already. And so the idea of a Biden Harris presidency is just extraordinarily
[1:31:13.520 --> 1:31:22.720]  grotesque. And when you have someone like Biden, who is so monumentally corrupt, and
[1:31:22.720 --> 1:31:28.800]  has been so his entire political career on a political salary, he's got all these homes
[1:31:28.800 --> 1:31:32.640]  and all this wealth, where did that come from? Well, we're seeing now exactly where it came
[1:31:32.640 --> 1:31:38.560]  from, which was things like manipulating American foreign policy for the benefit of his family
[1:31:38.560 --> 1:31:50.600]  income. So you're looking at a choice in which the the worst choice by far will be Biden
[1:31:50.600 --> 1:31:58.840]  Harris, because they will simply unleash or through them will be unleashed every element
[1:31:58.840 --> 1:32:04.600]  of the woke agenda. And the woke agenda is simply the agenda of the, the 1%, the global
[1:32:04.600 --> 1:32:12.600]  cultures, I call it, who have hijacked the left specifically and systematically at the
[1:32:12.600 --> 1:32:18.320]  genuine left, the whole democratic left as people remember, and they've replaced it.
[1:32:18.320 --> 1:32:23.440]  And David, isn't that just to interrupt the big joke is to call the establishment and
[1:32:23.440 --> 1:32:27.360]  Democrats and all the big banks of the chai comms, the EU and Hollywood, the academics
[1:32:27.360 --> 1:32:32.600]  and all of it saying that they're the resistance. Well, yeah, to the people, I mean, you can't
[1:32:32.600 --> 1:32:37.120]  get more establishment than almost all the other billionaires lined up against Trump.
[1:32:37.120 --> 1:32:42.680]  Well, this is the thing, Alex, you see, this is the extraordinary transformation of the
[1:32:42.680 --> 1:32:51.000]  left that's gone on, because I was brought up in the in a left political household in
[1:32:51.000 --> 1:32:58.040]  Britain in the 1950s and 60s. And in those days, the reason I was attracted to it is
[1:32:58.040 --> 1:33:05.720]  the left were going on marches and protests demanding freedom of speech. They were challenging
[1:33:05.720 --> 1:33:10.960]  the power of what were then the millionaires and multimillionaires. And they were they were
[1:33:10.960 --> 1:33:16.640]  challenging power. They were challenging authority. That's why I was attracted to it. I've always
[1:33:16.640 --> 1:33:20.960]  challenged authority all my life and been very suspicious of it. With good reason, it
[1:33:20.960 --> 1:33:27.920]  turns out. But what's happened through the funding and the manipulation of these corporations,
[1:33:27.920 --> 1:33:34.120]  people like Soros, and of course, the Silicon Valley corporations, and so many more, is
[1:33:34.120 --> 1:33:41.920]  that they've hijacked the left, and they've reversed it. So so now there's lots of people
[1:33:41.920 --> 1:33:48.240]  that are called the right in politics, who were actually just the old genuine left. And
[1:33:48.240 --> 1:33:57.720]  exactly the woke mentality is being funded. It's been orchestrated by the same cult networks
[1:33:57.720 --> 1:34:03.080]  through the universities and through the schools getting more extreme. And we now have a situation
[1:34:03.080 --> 1:34:11.560]  bizarre to someone like me that grew up in the situation I've described, whereby the
[1:34:11.560 --> 1:34:20.360]  so called left are in bed and in Hock with the corporations. And you know, if they would
[1:34:20.360 --> 1:34:28.280]  just stop and say, hold on a minute, George Soros, for instance, is funding all these
[1:34:28.280 --> 1:34:36.140]  woke groups, your Black Lives Matter, which is just an organization created and massively
[1:34:36.140 --> 1:34:44.840]  funded by the by the cult to divide and rule America on the grounds of race. And and you
[1:34:44.840 --> 1:34:53.800]  have a George Soros who's doing all this, who actually said, I don't look at the social
[1:34:53.800 --> 1:34:58.800]  consequences of what I do, I'm just there to make money. Now, why would someone with
[1:34:58.800 --> 1:35:06.640]  that attitude be funding these so called left groups? Because it's a scam, and they
[1:35:06.640 --> 1:35:13.000]  hijacked the left, they've reversed it. And that's why you now have the corporations and
[1:35:13.000 --> 1:35:20.080]  the so called liberal left, it's not in in cohorts with each other, pushing the same
[1:35:20.080 --> 1:35:27.720]  agenda. And so because of this inversion, you now have anti fascist groups like Antifa,
[1:35:27.720 --> 1:35:35.280]  who are fascistic, they're fascist. They are they are behaving like the the fascist groups
[1:35:35.280 --> 1:35:42.320]  in Nazi Germany, while calling themselves anti fascist. It's like Joseph Goebbels is
[1:35:42.320 --> 1:35:49.900]  supposed to have said in Germany, about one of the techniques of manipulation is accuse
[1:35:49.900 --> 1:35:55.000]  your enemies of what you're doing. And that's what you get from the but it also goes to
[1:35:55.000 --> 1:36:00.480]  the AI, uncreative nature of the enemy that's so alien, that it only can invert because
[1:36:00.480 --> 1:36:05.840]  it can't doesn't know us, it can only flip what we're doing. It's mathematical, it only
[1:36:05.840 --> 1:36:13.720]  it perfectly flips every time. Yeah. And so this won't mentality, which is incredibly
[1:36:13.720 --> 1:36:25.320]  a naive but also at its core, deeply deeply facistic, will be unleashed with no limits.
[1:36:25.320 --> 1:36:30.960]  If there is a Biden Harris, let's talk about that unleashing with David and talk about
[1:36:30.960 --> 1:36:34.520]  the second lockdown we know is coming here next, it's all about a test, but they're
[1:36:34.520 --> 1:36:40.600]  under we are in solidarity with the UK, with Germany, with Japan, with China, with, with
[1:36:40.600 --> 1:36:48.240]  the Africa, with everyone, we are in total solidarity. Stay with us.
[1:36:48.240 --> 1:36:53.360]  Look it up for yourself. The head of the Davos Group issued a report one six months ago calling
[1:36:53.360 --> 1:36:59.520]  for world government to be openly established to respond to COVID-19. The COVID-19 was a
[1:36:59.520 --> 1:37:05.600]  blessing to lower the planet's carbon footprint. Since then, Prince Charles and countless others
[1:37:05.600 --> 1:37:11.720]  have come out and said the exact same thing. The most ancient form of total war is called
[1:37:11.720 --> 1:37:18.040]  siege. That's when you cut people off from their resources. That's when you lock them
[1:37:18.040 --> 1:37:22.560]  down. And this isn't siege to make us capitulate to the globalist or just get rid of Donald
[1:37:22.560 --> 1:37:27.040]  Trump. That's only part of it. This is siege to literally train us to be poor and to get
[1:37:27.040 --> 1:37:33.280]  us into deep debt. So then the globalist social engineers can dictate how we live our lives
[1:37:33.280 --> 1:37:37.960]  with the social credit score surveillance threat. You've heard the US Army saying our
[1:37:37.960 --> 1:37:42.320]  job is to kill people and break things. Well, that's what the lockdown's doing. It's starving
[1:37:42.320 --> 1:37:45.560]  the third world, millions and millions of death. It's breaking down the supply chain
[1:37:45.560 --> 1:37:51.280]  in society. It's their mission. I once saw a bumper sticker that read, if you want your
[1:37:51.280 --> 1:37:57.080]  children to listen to you, whisper. And it's true. A lot of times if somebody's shouting
[1:37:57.080 --> 1:38:01.440]  and yelling, even of what they're talking about is important, people tend to tune it
[1:38:01.440 --> 1:38:07.120]  out. You know why I know that? Because I'm Alex Jones. And I've been pretty obnoxious
[1:38:07.120 --> 1:38:11.640]  over the years because I'm worried about the New World Order. And I read about all their
[1:38:11.640 --> 1:38:17.600]  plans to lockdown civilization, start the third world and then enslave the first world.
[1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:22.560]  I've been really, really loud and really, really aggressive. And we've had a big effect.
[1:38:22.560 --> 1:38:27.160]  But now it's time to think about every different angle and every different way where you get
[1:38:27.160 --> 1:38:32.840]  people to think for themselves before it's too late. The lockdown, social distancing,
[1:38:32.840 --> 1:38:40.400]  the mask is meant to end human civilization. We are under a civilization collapse weapon.
[1:38:40.400 --> 1:38:45.800]  So this is live and death. Please share info wars.com and band on video and watch our live
[1:38:45.800 --> 1:38:49.120]  election coverage.
[1:38:49.120 --> 1:38:53.480]  I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media, what am I most proud of when
[1:38:53.480 --> 1:38:57.920]  it comes to the show? And it's the fact that info wars more than 25 years ago, doing basic
[1:38:57.920 --> 1:39:02.880]  research with what the club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying, developed
[1:39:02.880 --> 1:39:07.480]  the hypothesis that the communist China had been set up to take our jobs and transfer
[1:39:07.480 --> 1:39:12.080]  them to China and then make us economically destitute and position us into debt. Well,
[1:39:12.080 --> 1:39:17.080]  now China owns the debt. Now China owns Hollywood, all the one side of trading deals. It turns
[1:39:17.080 --> 1:39:22.280]  out our analysis was absolutely dead on. But again, it wasn't that hard. The CFR and others
[1:39:22.280 --> 1:39:27.720]  admitted what they were doing, but still others didn't want to focus on that issue. We did
[1:39:27.720 --> 1:39:32.640]  and you focused on it by supporting us and info wars. So when you go to info wars store
[1:39:32.640 --> 1:39:37.360]  com and get all the great supplements, books, t shirts, films, water filtration, air filtration,
[1:39:37.360 --> 1:39:41.680]  all of it, you're funding the organization that literally helped break up the world.
[1:39:41.680 --> 1:39:44.680]  That's really happening. So that's a big accomplishment for all of you. I'm going to
[1:39:44.680 --> 1:39:52.280]  thank you for your support. Okay, my fellow patriots, we are two days away from the election
[1:39:52.280 --> 1:39:56.720]  and the big talking point by the young turds, all the communists, all the socialists and
[1:39:56.720 --> 1:40:02.440]  AOCs, people in the democratic party and media matters and George Soros is that we want violence
[1:40:02.440 --> 1:40:06.480]  and that we offensively want to go out and kill them or attack them. That's the last
[1:40:06.480 --> 1:40:13.240]  thing I ever want that would turn these dirty anti American, anti God, anti family, anti
[1:40:13.240 --> 1:40:19.240]  cop, anti constitution, anti bill of rights, anti common sense people into barbers. No
[1:40:19.240 --> 1:40:25.360]  offensive violence, no killing or shooting anybody that isn't trying to kill or shooting.
[1:40:25.360 --> 1:40:29.560]  You have no desire for this. We have been talking about the democrats calling for civil
[1:40:29.560 --> 1:40:33.120]  war, calling for an override in the White House calling for killing Trump calling for
[1:40:33.120 --> 1:40:36.880]  killing cops. It's all over the news. You see the violent attacks. And we're simply
[1:40:36.880 --> 1:40:41.400]  saying that if they kill Trump or have a fraudulent election and throw him out of office and come
[1:40:41.400 --> 1:40:46.760]  after us, people have to be ready to defend themselves. Defense, not offense. Look out
[1:40:46.760 --> 1:40:51.960]  for false flags.
[1:40:51.960 --> 1:41:05.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:05.600 --> 1:41:13.440]  Keep your eyes on the road and your hands upon the wheel. The future is uncertain and
[1:41:13.440 --> 1:41:24.320]  the end is always near. David, I'm David dot com and iconic dot com. Iconic is our guest
[1:41:24.320 --> 1:41:29.840]  here for 30 minutes to the next hour. This is all part of our 24 hour plus coverage.
[1:41:29.840 --> 1:41:33.760]  So David, I want to get back into the election back into COVID back into the global takeover.
[1:41:33.760 --> 1:41:37.800]  And I mean, we're not ragging. I wish we were wrong. Our credibility, your credibility,
[1:41:37.800 --> 1:41:42.800]  mine are just stratospheric. I mean, I know in Joe Rogan, it'd be exhausted with a broken
[1:41:42.800 --> 1:41:48.240]  tooth to a terrible job and people like give it 99% stars and it's 12 million views on
[1:41:48.240 --> 1:41:51.920]  one platform and they think it's the best thing ever. Only because they hate the system
[1:41:51.920 --> 1:41:57.840]  so much that anyone opposing it, they support. I mean, I'm not puffing myself up here. I
[1:41:57.840 --> 1:42:02.320]  suck a lot of the time. You don't. You seem to always be hitting on all cylinders, but
[1:42:02.320 --> 1:42:10.240]  we're sitting here with them saying we're going to say he wins tonight at nine and seven
[1:42:10.240 --> 1:42:14.640]  big tech companies and you know, seven media companies are allowed to say who the winner
[1:42:14.640 --> 1:42:18.480]  is, but no one else is. We're going to silence Trump if he challenges it and they go to that
[1:42:18.480 --> 1:42:22.880]  doesn't work. We're going to hold it up forever to break the country up. And they've got groups
[1:42:22.880 --> 1:42:26.960]  publicly saying they're going to storm the White House. How do you respond to something
[1:42:26.960 --> 1:42:31.040]  like this? And what do you gut level? Cause you're a guy that's tied into the zeitgeist.
[1:42:31.040 --> 1:42:33.440]  What do you think they're going to pull? Cause I know they change it minute to minute. They've
[1:42:33.440 --> 1:42:37.200]  got different plans, you know, the spiders gauging what move it's going to make. It's
[1:42:37.200 --> 1:42:40.720]  kind of ready to pounce, but gut level, what do you think's about to unfold?
[1:42:42.400 --> 1:42:48.880]  Well, I was saying a long time ago that the plan was to create civil war in America.
[1:42:50.720 --> 1:42:55.120]  I mean, whenever you're looking at a few controlling the many, what you're looking at
[1:42:55.120 --> 1:43:00.800]  is the absolute bottom line requirement to divide and rule the many. And, you know,
[1:43:00.800 --> 1:43:08.960]  we talked about the techniques of order out of chaos and chaos is a massive currency of control
[1:43:08.960 --> 1:43:14.640]  creating the chaos and then offering the order. You create enough chaos. You can start to justify
[1:43:14.640 --> 1:43:18.720]  putting troops on the streets, which is what's happening in, in Britain now because of this
[1:43:19.440 --> 1:43:29.920]  pandemic hoax. And, and so I feel that the way it's moving is that they plan either way,
[1:43:29.920 --> 1:43:40.800]  particularly if Trump wins to create a challenge to, to the result, but also massive chaos of
[1:43:40.800 --> 1:43:49.760]  people and, and, and violence in response to it, because this is all part of the divide and rule
[1:43:49.760 --> 1:43:56.880]  America and the create civil war scenario. And if the woke left, and I call it the woke left,
[1:43:56.880 --> 1:44:02.080]  because I call it the fate left, it's not the left at all. But if the woke left would actually
[1:44:02.080 --> 1:44:08.560]  wake rather than woke, they just see how they're being used in a port as a pawns in a game,
[1:44:09.280 --> 1:44:17.920]  which is supposed to set America at war with itself. Because while the population is fighting
[1:44:17.920 --> 1:44:26.720]  itself, then the, the, the cult and its agents that are holding strings of both sides can just
[1:44:26.720 --> 1:44:33.520]  go on transforming American society in the way that they want to without a real challenge,
[1:44:33.520 --> 1:44:38.400]  because the, the population of fighting each other, this is what they are. It's one of their
[1:44:38.400 --> 1:44:45.040]  great techniques. So I do think that they are, they are planning a big upheavals in the wake of
[1:44:45.040 --> 1:44:53.360]  this election, especially if Trump wins. I totally agree with you, David. What a historic moment.
[1:44:53.360 --> 1:44:58.720]  I'm worried about false flags too. Not now, but once the contention starts, that's why they
[1:44:58.720 --> 1:45:03.200]  want to go to this and then claim that the proud boys or some other group that's not offensively
[1:45:03.200 --> 1:45:07.520]  violent is going to stage something. I mean, I really just, I keep focusing and thinking and
[1:45:07.520 --> 1:45:13.120]  I just go false flag, false flag, false flag. Well, I have been picking up in the American
[1:45:13.120 --> 1:45:22.400]  media, which I watch a lot of this theme that white supremacists are going to, you know,
[1:45:22.400 --> 1:45:26.320]  cause lots of trouble in the wake of the election. We're up to our eyeballs as white supremacists
[1:45:26.320 --> 1:45:32.720]  everywhere supposedly. I know, but the funny thing is, as someone pointed out on an American
[1:45:32.720 --> 1:45:40.240]  show this morning I was watching, is that while they're putting up all the boards and the barriers
[1:45:40.240 --> 1:45:46.080]  on the windows of the shops anticipating this, what they're putting, many people are putting on
[1:45:46.080 --> 1:45:55.280]  the boards. The owners of the businesses is, we support BLM. Now, if it was going to be white
[1:45:55.280 --> 1:46:00.000]  supremacists, they would put, we support white supremacists or we support them. Exactly. They
[1:46:00.000 --> 1:46:07.200]  know who the terrorists are. They've got about to, exactly. Exactly who is planned to cause the
[1:46:07.200 --> 1:46:16.320]  trouble. And they are turkeys voting for Christmas and Thanksgiving because they are, they are, they
[1:46:16.320 --> 1:46:24.640]  are helping to create a society in which they'll be eventually the targets of it. I mean, every
[1:46:24.640 --> 1:46:32.000]  revolution swallows its own children in the end because it uses people because it winds them up
[1:46:32.000 --> 1:46:36.480]  and gives them a reason. And it knows they're not going to deliver to them. So they've got to,
[1:46:36.480 --> 1:46:41.680]  in prison or kill those that rob the power, just like Hitler did in the essay, just like
[1:46:41.680 --> 1:46:48.480]  Lenin did. Exactly. They do it every time. Yeah. And, and, you know, they use these people as, as
[1:46:48.480 --> 1:46:53.920]  vehicles and pawns of the revolution, which is what Black Lives Matter and everything are being
[1:46:53.920 --> 1:47:01.280]  used for. And then once the power shift happens and they get control, well, the people that have
[1:47:01.280 --> 1:47:06.800]  helped them get to that point are no longer useful. In fact, they're an embarrassment to them. So we'll
[1:47:06.800 --> 1:47:12.000]  sort them out as well. This is what always happens in these, these situations and they're planning
[1:47:12.000 --> 1:47:18.320]  to do the same. So, you know, the, the, the woke mentality will be unleashed, but a lot of the,
[1:47:18.320 --> 1:47:25.200]  the wokers will be, they will be looking back and thinking, what will we doing when they see
[1:47:25.200 --> 1:47:29.520]  the consequences for them eventually? But they won't have the media support then. Suddenly,
[1:47:29.520 --> 1:47:32.880]  when they complain, there'll be no news article about them that they will have no voice.
[1:47:33.920 --> 1:47:41.440]  Yeah. I mean, you've only got to look at this situation with Hunter Biden and Joe Biden and
[1:47:41.440 --> 1:47:50.800]  China and Ukraine to see now the extraordinary scale at which the mainstream media has become
[1:47:50.800 --> 1:47:56.720]  just. Oh, they just lockstep covered it up. Unbelievable. I mean, it's like, it's like,
[1:47:56.720 --> 1:48:03.360]  you know, I talked about before with you, Alex, this cult that I've been talking about all these
[1:48:03.360 --> 1:48:08.560]  years has entered the bloody room. It's entered the room. Like you said, it came in and locked the
[1:48:08.560 --> 1:48:14.640]  door and said, oh yeah, I'm real. And so because the cult has come into the room where we can see
[1:48:14.640 --> 1:48:19.920]  it because of this pandemic hoax, all these different elements controlled by the cult have
[1:48:19.920 --> 1:48:27.760]  entered the room. And so now it's unless you're completely asleep and in a coma, it's surely
[1:48:27.760 --> 1:48:33.760]  not possible to deny that the mainstream media is just a vehicle for. No, I totally agree. But you
[1:48:33.760 --> 1:48:37.920]  told us 25, 30 years ago it was going to happen. It all came through exactly as you said, literally.
[1:48:38.480 --> 1:48:46.400]  What's coming next, David? Well, you know, there was a whistleblower or claim to be a
[1:48:46.400 --> 1:48:54.400]  whistleblower in Canada just a few weeks ago. And whether he or she was who can say for sure,
[1:48:54.400 --> 1:48:59.200]  what I can say for sure is what they said they'd uncovered and they claim to be a member of the
[1:48:59.200 --> 1:49:05.520]  Liberal Party is going on. Yeah. What they said was the plan in Canada and it's the plan for the
[1:49:05.520 --> 1:49:13.760]  world is spot on. And that is, you know, in the books over the years, we, you know, we all talked
[1:49:13.760 --> 1:49:21.520]  about the fact that the part of the plan is to take away all private property and all private
[1:49:21.520 --> 1:49:30.160]  ownership. And this whistleblower was saying, and I think he or she is spot on, that the plan is,
[1:49:31.040 --> 1:49:38.160]  he was talking about or talking about Canada, but this is global, to get people in such dire
[1:49:38.160 --> 1:49:45.840]  economic straits with debt that they simply cannot repay. And what happens is they come along and
[1:49:45.840 --> 1:49:54.000]  they say, what we're going to do is we're going to offer it to forgive your debt and wipe it out.
[1:49:54.000 --> 1:50:02.480]  But in return, we want you to sign over all your property, all your basically major possessions
[1:50:02.480 --> 1:50:07.280]  to us. And you will future follow us. Your identity is now us with the universal income we
[1:50:07.280 --> 1:50:14.080]  control you. That's their goal. Davos admits that. The idea is that people own nothing and just rent
[1:50:14.080 --> 1:50:21.440]  everything. And of course, once you, because the whole point of these lockdowns, the whole
[1:50:21.440 --> 1:50:28.320]  point of them is to destroy the independent livelihoods and employment of the population.
[1:50:28.320 --> 1:50:34.960]  So that the whole population becomes dependent on the cult, what we, what people call the 1%
[1:50:34.960 --> 1:50:42.160]  because the only way you're going to create control by the few of the, of the rest in,
[1:50:42.160 --> 1:50:49.440]  in almost an entirety through dependency is to destroy the independent livelihoods of the
[1:50:49.440 --> 1:50:52.640]  population. I totally agree. Stay there. Let's talk about the way out of it and what's coming
[1:50:52.640 --> 1:50:57.920]  next with David. I hear today with us and let's be clear listeners. Well, they'll say, I don't
[1:50:57.920 --> 1:51:02.000]  care about rent. I don't care if they surveil me other than high, they're using the data against
[1:51:02.000 --> 1:51:06.720]  you. These are inhuman psychotics, whether it's aliens, the devil, whatever you want to, I don't
[1:51:06.720 --> 1:51:11.040]  know what it is. I just know that whatever the archetype is, it's happening. It's anti human.
[1:51:11.040 --> 1:51:16.160]  It's anti you. It wants you alone, sick and dead. And the whole process is getting you
[1:51:16.160 --> 1:51:20.720]  debilitated and weak and tied up in the web. So the spider can have its meal. That's what
[1:51:20.720 --> 1:51:25.520]  the allegory of the spider that David, I cast is so on target David.com. We're Alex Jones with
[1:51:25.520 --> 1:51:32.720]  Info Wars coverage and we have the ongoing 24 hour analysis of the election. It's live now.
[1:51:32.720 --> 1:51:35.120]  It is now November 3rd, 2020.
[1:51:37.520 --> 1:51:43.600]  Cognitive dissonance is a major issue amongst the left. It can be very stressful dealing with
[1:51:43.600 --> 1:51:49.360]  facts you refuse to accept. If you have a family member suffering from this degenerative mental
[1:51:49.360 --> 1:51:55.920]  condition, buy them a bottle of ultimate fish oil from info wars store.com. Studies have suggested
[1:51:55.920 --> 1:52:02.240]  that fish oils and fish oil supplementation can slightly lower blood pressure, decrease triglyceride
[1:52:02.240 --> 1:52:07.920]  levels, decrease the growth rate of plaque and provide a soothing reduction in inflammatory
[1:52:07.920 --> 1:52:15.360]  responses in joints and the digestive system. Recent studies have suggested that high EPA and DHA
[1:52:15.360 --> 1:52:22.640]  fish oil can stimulate immune function by increasing the concentration and activity of immune cells.
[1:52:22.640 --> 1:52:29.200]  It worked for my family and now I can have a logical and calm discussion about actual facts
[1:52:29.200 --> 1:52:35.200]  that pertain to reality. Get your ultimate fish oil for a friend, family member or yourself at
[1:52:35.200 --> 1:52:46.000]  infowarsstore.com. It's all on record. Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, they were all hired a year
[1:52:46.000 --> 1:52:52.000]  ago and then against six months ago to war game how to get the public to stay locked down during
[1:52:52.000 --> 1:52:57.120]  a pandemic and how to get the public to take inoculations and they talk about calling people
[1:52:57.120 --> 1:53:02.320]  heroes that do it. They talk about shaming those that don't. This has all been psychologically
[1:53:02.320 --> 1:53:08.000]  tested. It's all been psychologically prepared and once they get you to lock down for 15 days,
[1:53:08.000 --> 1:53:13.040]  you notice now they say it's permanent. That's how it works. Oh, just put these handcuffs on.
[1:53:13.040 --> 1:53:18.320]  The serial killer says the woman in the parking lot and everything will be all right. No. Now,
[1:53:18.320 --> 1:53:24.320]  we've already put the handcuffs on and we're in the serial killer's van. He's taking us to his
[1:53:24.320 --> 1:53:29.280]  shack in the woods to slowly torture us to death. That's the allegory. We got to bust out of this
[1:53:29.280 --> 1:53:33.840]  thing now. We got to say no now. We got to make a run for it now, but we still can't. Once he gets
[1:53:33.840 --> 1:53:38.000]  us in that basement, it's going to get a lot, lot worse, folks. So stop submitting.
[1:53:41.040 --> 1:53:43.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:43.760 --> 1:53:57.280]  We say grace.
[1:54:06.960 --> 1:54:11.120]  All right. David Ikes with us next segment. He's going to hit the lockdown in Europe
[1:54:11.120 --> 1:54:15.040]  part two. Where this is going. What's going to affect us here? This is all a beta test for what's
[1:54:15.040 --> 1:54:19.600]  coming here, folks. So you don't already have empathy or solidarity. You should. I know you do.
[1:54:19.600 --> 1:54:23.920]  We're all connected. David Ike David Ike.com. He's got his new book out. The answer at David
[1:54:23.920 --> 1:54:27.520]  Ike.com. You got to read. It's amazing. I read it like so big book. I written two days
[1:54:28.640 --> 1:54:32.640]  during the weekend about a month ago. David short segment here. Long segment coming up.
[1:54:32.640 --> 1:54:35.200]  What is else is front and center for you because I talked to the break. I said,
[1:54:35.200 --> 1:54:38.240]  what do you want to cover next? He said, well, whatever you want. No, what is in the front
[1:54:38.240 --> 1:54:44.480]  of David Ike's mind right now? Well, what we do about this, you know,
[1:54:45.840 --> 1:54:53.600]  we've been talking for a long time about where this is planned to go. And people laugh, people
[1:54:53.600 --> 1:55:04.000]  dismissed, people wave their hand and nonsense. And in 2020, it's come to fruition. It's starting
[1:55:04.000 --> 1:55:11.440]  to well, not starting to it is massively impacting on people's lives on people's ability to feed
[1:55:11.440 --> 1:55:20.560]  their family and people's basic freedoms. And I'm not trying to frighten people. I'm trying to
[1:55:20.560 --> 1:55:27.360]  concentrate minds. When I say that if people think it's bad now, this is nothing to where
[1:55:27.360 --> 1:55:36.640]  it's meant to go. And it is bad now. It's horrific now. But we're talking a level of undiluted evil
[1:55:36.640 --> 1:55:46.080]  that has no empathy, that has no compassion, and has no emotional consequence for anything it does.
[1:55:46.080 --> 1:55:52.960]  Thus, there are no limits. In fact, far from being limits, it gets off on the suffering it creates.
[1:55:52.960 --> 1:55:59.600]  Well, that's right. They don't just not care. It enjoys it. Exactly. And so what I'm saying is
[1:56:01.040 --> 1:56:07.680]  where we are now is where we are now. It's not where it's meant to end. It's meant to go much
[1:56:07.680 --> 1:56:16.240]  more catastrophic even than we are now. So when are we going to draw the line? And if you can't
[1:56:16.240 --> 1:56:23.520]  summon the courage to stand up for yourself, then at least look at the kids, the children and the
[1:56:23.520 --> 1:56:32.160]  young people. I mean, we're seeing now their present and their future being stolen from them
[1:56:32.160 --> 1:56:37.920]  to the point where lots of young people are got to levels of despair where they're committing
[1:56:37.920 --> 1:56:42.960]  suicide around the world. We see it. Orwell said a boot stomping on the human face forever.
[1:56:42.960 --> 1:56:48.240]  This is a smothering, a blanket over our face on record making us sick. Bacterial
[1:56:48.240 --> 1:56:52.480]  pneumonia is causing most of the deaths. It turns out Fauci wrote a paper 2008 confirming that.
[1:56:52.480 --> 1:56:58.880]  They're literally a cult murdering us in front of our faces. Exactly. I mean,
[1:56:58.880 --> 1:57:05.440]  you know, I've been saying since March, there is no virus. And all I have seen since, especially
[1:57:05.440 --> 1:57:14.880]  in the last few weeks, is that that is true. It's a scam on that level. And we are seeing
[1:57:15.520 --> 1:57:23.120]  this explosion of cases around the world, which is justifying the more lockdowns and more fascism
[1:57:23.680 --> 1:57:30.000]  that is based on a test that's not testing for the virus, the RT-PCR test. Its inventor,
[1:57:30.000 --> 1:57:35.440]  Kerry Mullis, said this cannot detect and diagnose infectious diseases. That's right. It's on record
[1:57:35.440 --> 1:57:40.000]  of fraud. They're calling regular flu, regular colds, all of this. And the white lab coat cult
[1:57:40.000 --> 1:57:43.840]  that we're supposed to trust has betrayed us. But when white lab coats come out and tell the truth,
[1:57:43.840 --> 1:57:48.960]  they're banned. That tells you everything you know right there. Exactly. And so what we're facing,
[1:57:49.840 --> 1:57:58.400]  ladies and gentlemen, is an assault on human freedom and the very existence in many ways of
[1:57:58.400 --> 1:58:07.440]  humanity, as we've known it, from this deeply, deeply evil and disturbed cult. And we have to say,
[1:58:08.240 --> 1:58:13.520]  how much of this more are we going to take? Because, you know, I was speaking in Birmingham,
[1:58:13.520 --> 1:58:18.960]  Britain's second biggest city on Saturday at a freedom rally, an anti-lockdown rally. And,
[1:58:18.960 --> 1:58:24.400]  you know, we're just going now into a second national lockdown. And I said to you know, business
[1:58:24.400 --> 1:58:30.960]  people, they are setting out to destroy you. This is what the lockdown is about. That's right.
[1:58:30.960 --> 1:58:35.520]  You're participating, like Jews in Nazi Germany, running into the pitch to be shot in the head
[1:58:35.520 --> 1:58:39.760]  by the Nazis. You've got to fight back. Let's cover the new big lockdown with David Eich in 60
[1:58:39.760 --> 1:58:45.120]  seconds. DavidEich.com. We'll be right back. I'm Alan Jones with newswars.com, election night.news.
[1:58:46.960 --> 1:58:52.800]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed. And why is that? It's one of the
[1:58:52.800 --> 1:58:59.440]  tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree like bush grows from it that produces more mustard seeds.
[1:59:00.160 --> 1:59:05.040]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects. They didn't
[1:59:05.040 --> 1:59:11.200]  know why. Well, with modern science, we know it's one of the purest, cleanest, organic forms of
[1:59:11.200 --> 1:59:18.880]  selenium. We have bio-true selenium sold out for months back in stock at infowarsstore.com,
[1:59:18.880 --> 1:59:27.040]  at 50% off, store-wide free shipping, and triple patriot points. Bio-true selenium at infowars
[1:59:27.040 --> 1:59:33.200]  store.com is an amazing product. And it's even more amazing in that it funds our operation.
[1:59:33.200 --> 1:59:38.400]  But if you don't know about selenium, research it. It is an essential nutrient in the body
[1:59:38.400 --> 1:59:43.040]  that you've actually have to have. It's back in stock 50% off, triple patriot points,
[1:59:43.040 --> 1:59:59.680]  at infowarsstore.com, and with free shipping.
[1:59:59.680 --> 2:00:06.880]  If you ain't into that, we don't give a damn. They are so scared of the American people
[2:00:06.880 --> 2:00:14.480]  and others waking up. I'm Alex Jones, your host. We've got 24-hour plus live coverage here
[2:00:14.480 --> 2:00:19.760]  with incredible guests all day, all night. We're going to be here tonight when Biden tries to
[2:00:19.760 --> 2:00:25.360]  announce early victory. We're going to be here when that fails. Hold on to it and create a giant
[2:00:25.360 --> 2:00:30.080]  disaster with all these mail-in ballots. We're going to be here together in defiance of their
[2:00:30.080 --> 2:00:34.560]  censorship. And I want to thank all the listeners for keeping us on air. All right, David Ike is here.
[2:00:34.560 --> 2:00:40.480]  He said eight months ago that the virus isn't real. He said the hospitals aren't full. They're
[2:00:40.480 --> 2:00:45.120]  empty. All of it came out. It was true. They had to admit they had actors. No one was there.
[2:00:45.120 --> 2:00:52.320]  They're counting car wrecks, gunshot wounds, cancers, everything. Just everything.
[2:00:53.520 --> 2:00:58.800]  Shark attacks, boating accidents, everything. Automable accidents. It's all being counted
[2:00:58.800 --> 2:01:06.640]  as COVID. And Trump's now finally talking about that. And they get $13,000 and they say,
[2:01:06.640 --> 2:01:13.280]  you're a COVID patient. And $39,000 that they intubate you. I mean, this is just a giant scan
[2:01:13.280 --> 2:01:21.600]  of the $2,000 they put death certificate COVID. This is organized fraud, organized fraud. And
[2:01:21.600 --> 2:01:28.800]  then I look, Wales is the new beta test, not Melbourne, Australia or not Madrid, Spain. Those
[2:01:28.800 --> 2:01:33.760]  are the other ones for the UN where people come out to walk their dog wearing a mask. They're
[2:01:33.760 --> 2:01:41.200]  arrested. In hunt for virus source, WHO let China take charge. Even the New York Times has to admit
[2:01:41.200 --> 2:01:46.480]  China is in charge of how we do this. Incredible. Snap polls, 70% of English people, back prime
[2:01:46.480 --> 2:01:50.880]  ministers plan to return to lockdown. Other polls show only 10%. These are all fake polls.
[2:01:50.880 --> 2:01:56.720]  In San Francisco, viruses contain, but schools are still closed. Tens of thousands attend late
[2:01:56.720 --> 2:02:01.040]  night rallies for Trump in Wisconsin. They're saying he's spreading the disease, but Black Lives
[2:02:01.040 --> 2:02:06.320]  Matter is good. Corona lockdown cops, quiz people on their food purchases in Wales.
[2:02:08.080 --> 2:02:13.840]  Arrest people that are caught buying wine. UK brings in army to help first China style. That's
[2:02:13.840 --> 2:02:18.080]  what they're calling it. Mass COVID 19 testing in Liverpool. It's not about death now. It's about,
[2:02:18.080 --> 2:02:22.560]  oh, you have it, you disappear to a COVID facility. It's about getting rid of the process of Magna
[2:02:22.560 --> 2:02:29.040]  Cardo. Bin collectors, trash can collectors, delayed in Canterbury and other areas as whistleblowers.
[2:02:31.840 --> 2:02:38.320]  It goes on to say because of COVID 19 shortages. So everything's breaking down. That's what's
[2:02:38.320 --> 2:02:43.680]  going on here. And they admit the whole time that it's never going to end. Bill Gates said two weeks
[2:02:43.680 --> 2:02:49.680]  ago, oh, it's 10 years. It's forever. This is a nightmare dystopia they are putting us into
[2:02:49.680 --> 2:02:54.080]  through their weakness, through their crisis. So David, please continue. You're there in the UK.
[2:02:54.080 --> 2:02:58.400]  You're witnessing it. You predicted it. Tell us what's currently happening and tell us how to get
[2:02:58.400 --> 2:03:02.320]  out of this. Because we know what they're doing to you is being beta tested in the US and Blue
[2:03:02.320 --> 2:03:09.680]  Cities as well. It's all you indirectly. Well, what's interesting, Alex, is in Liverpool,
[2:03:09.680 --> 2:03:18.560]  in the northwest of England, there's quite an independent mentality there. And a lot of them
[2:03:18.560 --> 2:03:24.000]  have been pushing back and they've not been doing what the government is telling them they should
[2:03:24.000 --> 2:03:31.280]  do. And it's no accident that they've chosen Liverpool as what they claim. Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[2:03:31.280 --> 2:03:39.200]  And is a trial of mass city testing. And they're putting thousands of troops into Liverpool
[2:03:39.200 --> 2:03:48.960]  troops to oversee this mass testing. And while they're saying that it's a trial,
[2:03:49.920 --> 2:03:57.840]  the British Medical Journal a few weeks ago, revealed some documents, some government documents
[2:03:57.840 --> 2:04:04.320]  for something called Operation Moonshot that had been leaked to them. And it was describing
[2:04:04.320 --> 2:04:11.840]  exactly what they've started to do in Liverpool. And the fact that by the the early months of or
[2:04:11.840 --> 2:04:20.800]  even weeks of 2021, they're going to be testing millions and millions of people a day. And this
[2:04:20.800 --> 2:04:27.920]  is the scam you see, because they've got a test that's not testing for the virus because it can't.
[2:04:27.920 --> 2:04:33.760]  It means that the more they can get people tested, the more of these fake positive cases they're
[2:04:33.760 --> 2:04:41.600]  going to get. And the reason that the overwhelming vast majority of people who test positive with
[2:04:41.600 --> 2:04:48.880]  the PCR test have no symptoms is because there's nothing wrong with them. And what they did and
[2:04:48.880 --> 2:04:56.000]  what they're doing now is they've come up with this scam called asymptomatic. Because it's not a
[2:04:56.000 --> 2:05:05.280]  deadly virus, it doesn't bloody exist. They have to do it by propaganda and perceptual programming.
[2:05:05.280 --> 2:05:12.960]  So they can't produce all the people who are ill with it. So the vast majority are symptomatic.
[2:05:12.960 --> 2:05:18.880]  So what they've then said is, oh, yeah, but these people with no symptoms, they can pass it on to
[2:05:18.880 --> 2:05:26.080]  other people. And so they've used that to justify for the first time, the quarantine of their
[2:05:26.080 --> 2:05:35.280]  healthy and not just the sick. So number one, if we want to bring an end to this virus overnight,
[2:05:35.280 --> 2:05:43.760]  the 5G element apart, and that's another story. They're number one, people stop getting tested.
[2:05:43.760 --> 2:05:49.680]  It's a trap. They're telling you. Oh, they admit it's designed. We're almost all over false positives.
[2:05:49.680 --> 2:05:54.880]  And as testing goes up, the numbers go up, the deaths don't. They're just, it's so obvious.
[2:05:54.880 --> 2:06:01.600]  Yeah. But the thing is that the British government is spending all unbelievable amounts of money
[2:06:01.600 --> 2:06:09.680]  with advertisements in television and radio. All you hear is that stuff all the time to tell people
[2:06:09.680 --> 2:06:15.120]  that if you want to get back to normal, like it was before, you know, the concerts and the sport.
[2:06:15.120 --> 2:06:20.320]  But the truth is, it never goes back, does it? The gates set on TV, it never goes back. He goes,
[2:06:20.320 --> 2:06:25.680]  nothing non-essential is allowed. He said, no more sports, no more nothing. Yeah. But the point is
[2:06:25.680 --> 2:06:30.800]  that what they're claiming is the opposite. Because what they're saying is the way to get back to
[2:06:30.800 --> 2:06:37.680]  normal is to get tested. But you get tested with a test, not testing for the virus, it pings positive,
[2:06:37.680 --> 2:06:44.400]  absolutely nothing wrong with you. And it becomes the case. And the more cases from the more tests,
[2:06:44.400 --> 2:06:48.480]  the more reason they have, which is why we're going into another national lockdown in Britain,
[2:06:48.480 --> 2:06:55.440]  is saying, oh, we've got all these cases. So we've got to go further from bloody normal, not towards it.
[2:06:55.440 --> 2:07:02.400]  So people stop getting tested. I totally agree. What is the globalist in-game? Where do they want
[2:07:02.400 --> 2:07:07.520]  to take us with this? Cashless society, global social credit score, disappear, arrest server
[2:07:07.520 --> 2:07:11.520]  they want, like the UN says. What is their in-game and how is it going for them, David?
[2:07:13.520 --> 2:07:18.640]  Well, I think there are some very positive things happening. I can talk about Britain
[2:07:18.640 --> 2:07:26.400]  myself. What has happened is this, Alex, you know, in the spring, when they were playing
[2:07:26.400 --> 2:07:32.240]  this for the first time, there was an unknown in people's minds. I mean, those that have
[2:07:32.240 --> 2:07:36.960]  researched this for decades could see what- A fear of the unknown, myself included. You were right
[2:07:36.960 --> 2:07:42.000]  before I was. I was not sure for about a month. You were right. I was fear of the unknown. That's
[2:07:42.000 --> 2:07:47.760]  how they got us. Yeah, fear of the unknown. But what's been happening, you see, is through
[2:07:47.760 --> 2:07:55.280]  the months to present time, A, people are seeing the economic catastrophe that's unfolding because
[2:07:55.280 --> 2:08:03.840]  of it. But crucially, their daily experience is totally at odds with what the government is
[2:08:03.840 --> 2:08:11.920]  saying the situation is. And despite all the hysteria of censorship, information is getting out
[2:08:11.920 --> 2:08:17.840]  through various ways, word of mouth, and whatever you can to get around the censorship. And people
[2:08:17.840 --> 2:08:24.640]  are starting to put this together. You know, when I talked twice in Trafalgar Square, tens of
[2:08:24.640 --> 2:08:29.760]  thousands of people turned up. I spoke in Birmingham, another big crowd turned up, and they're right
[2:08:29.760 --> 2:08:36.800]  across the spectrum of society, all races, all religions, sexuality. And that's what the enemy
[2:08:36.800 --> 2:08:45.360]  fears is unity. This unity, that's why they want the woke fake left to create disunity. That's
[2:08:45.360 --> 2:08:53.120]  what it's there for. And so there are many, many encouraging things. And I talked to people. In
[2:08:53.120 --> 2:09:00.160]  fact, there was a police officer. Birmingham police were brilliant on Saturday. They just left us
[2:09:00.160 --> 2:09:05.920]  alone. Whereas the Metropolitan Police, actually the unit that came in weren't really the police.
[2:09:05.920 --> 2:09:13.680]  They were high at hands with their battens. But one of the police officers said, I'm with you.
[2:09:13.680 --> 2:09:23.840]  I'm with you. I agree with what you're doing. It's crazy. And what we need now is the ranks of
[2:09:23.840 --> 2:09:29.200]  the hierarchy and the implementers of the... This is the solution. Final segment with David Ock.
[2:09:29.200 --> 2:09:33.680]  This is the key to victory. He's going to lay it out for us on the other side. I can't wait to hear
[2:09:33.680 --> 2:09:39.680]  it. We are so appreciative of him. The new book is The Answer at DavidOck.com. I'm Alex Jones.
[2:09:39.680 --> 2:09:47.520]  It is Election Day 2020 live coverage. Stay with us. Introducing Info Wars Life, pure
[2:09:47.520 --> 2:09:55.440]  turmeric extract. This is taken under the tongue. It is pure turmeric. It goes together very well
[2:09:55.440 --> 2:10:01.120]  with our body's ultimate turmeric formula that is taken as a powdered capsule and absorbed in the
[2:10:01.120 --> 2:10:06.480]  stomach and intestines. This is absorbed under the tongue into the bloodstream and then the
[2:10:06.480 --> 2:10:11.520]  remaining also is then absorbed by the stomach. So it's more of an intense delivery system.
[2:10:11.520 --> 2:10:16.000]  The two formulas are different, but both are concentrates. And our first product got rave
[2:10:16.000 --> 2:10:20.000]  reviews. We've now been testing this out for several months. Some of our staff like it more
[2:10:20.000 --> 2:10:25.200]  than bodies. Some like bodies better. For me, they're both amazing for their anti-inflammatory
[2:10:25.200 --> 2:10:30.960]  action and so much more. And they fund the Info War. So get our new liquid turmeric extract exclusively.

[2:10:44.480 --> 2:10:49.360]  The controlled corporate media are mouthpieces for any big corporation or government that'll pay
[2:10:49.360 --> 2:10:55.120]  them. It's that simple. They've used our open free society against us. The controlled media will
[2:10:55.120 --> 2:11:00.160]  talk about a few mistakes I've made over the years and obsess over it. They see he's a liar on purpose,
[2:11:00.160 --> 2:11:05.200]  even though our success rate, our accuracy rate is way, way better than theirs. We try to tell the
[2:11:05.200 --> 2:11:10.480]  truth. They try a lot. They try to deceive. I'm trying to get people to realize that the global
[2:11:10.480 --> 2:11:16.640]  is to operate and how they manipulate, how they bamboozle the public. I'm trying to get the public
[2:11:16.640 --> 2:11:21.200]  to ask questions and to not believe what they're told in the face. I'm trying to get people
[2:11:22.240 --> 2:11:27.120]  to research for themselves. The globalists and their controlled corporate press say that
[2:11:27.120 --> 2:11:33.280]  researching and not trusting media is evil and is a conspiracy theory. But again, on its face,
[2:11:33.280 --> 2:11:38.640]  that is a fraud. Question everything. Question InfoWars. Add your own research to it and then
[2:11:38.640 --> 2:11:43.120]  decide what you're going to promote to others and what new sources are accurate. I believe InfoWars
[2:11:43.120 --> 2:11:50.720]  is the best source out there. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:11:50.720 --> 2:12:05.600]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[2:12:14.240 --> 2:12:18.480]  All right, Jim Hoffs of the Gateway Pond is joining us next. David, the icon,
[2:12:18.480 --> 2:12:23.200]  the guy that literally predicted it all is here with us. People say,
[2:12:23.200 --> 2:12:29.120]  Jones, you predicted all this. David, I predicted it before I did. That's just the way it is. Ted
[2:12:29.120 --> 2:12:33.680]  Gunnerson did and credits where it's due. But he doesn't care about that. He cares about defeating
[2:12:33.680 --> 2:12:43.280]  these people. In closing, you were getting into, as we went to break, where they're going, what
[2:12:43.280 --> 2:12:48.640]  they're doing, what's coming next, how we defeat them and getting people to understand that are
[2:12:48.640 --> 2:12:52.800]  within the system that they're replacing humans right now because they know humans are going to
[2:12:52.800 --> 2:12:57.680]  wake up in the end that this is an anti-human takeover. This is a robot silicon takeover because
[2:12:57.680 --> 2:13:02.320]  we see to get the military and police and bureaucrats and others to get the fact that
[2:13:02.320 --> 2:13:05.920]  they're on team human, whether they want to be on team human or not, and they better get with
[2:13:05.920 --> 2:13:13.680]  the program. That's what you're saying. Yeah. I mean, they know that the awakening to the scam is
[2:13:13.680 --> 2:13:18.000]  gathering pace and they've been preparing for it. I mean, you know, they've been cutting police
[2:13:18.880 --> 2:13:23.440]  in Britain for a long time and cutting numbers and funding and now suddenly they're recruiting
[2:13:23.440 --> 2:13:33.440]  thousands of police officers and they are for this very job of meeting civil resistance.
[2:13:33.440 --> 2:13:40.320]  But the real point is, you know, cities all over the world, Alex, now that we're seeing people
[2:13:40.320 --> 2:13:48.400]  awakened, but both from seeing that it's the nature of the lie, but also through their economic
[2:13:48.400 --> 2:13:56.880]  consequences and what we need and it is starting to happen. We need people within the hierarchy
[2:13:56.880 --> 2:14:05.760]  and enforcing the hierarchy's agenda to start breaking ranks because, you know, people need
[2:14:05.760 --> 2:14:14.080]  to understand and I do appreciate the pressure that is on doctors and medical staff to put COVID-19
[2:14:14.080 --> 2:14:19.440]  on death certificates. I do understand that, but what the people doing it need to understand
[2:14:19.440 --> 2:14:27.440]  is that in doing so, you are, never mind beating around the bush, you are a facilitator of fascism.
[2:14:28.080 --> 2:14:32.880]  Every time you put COVID-19 on a death certificate, someone has died from something else while they've
[2:14:32.880 --> 2:14:41.440]  all died of something else because there is no SARS-CoV-2. But therefore, I know, you know,
[2:14:41.440 --> 2:14:47.280]  you're fearful about your careers and you're fearful about speaking out, but my goodness,
[2:14:47.280 --> 2:14:53.600]  it's like I said earlier, where we are now is where we are now. This is going somewhere much,
[2:14:53.600 --> 2:14:58.560]  much more. You better be concerned about the end game of this agenda because they admit a post
[2:14:58.560 --> 2:15:03.600]  industrial world, global collapse, third world starving to death, us starving to death, and
[2:15:03.600 --> 2:15:08.320]  only things getting worse. I love it like COVID's causing millions to starve to death. No, the lockdown
[2:15:08.320 --> 2:15:14.960]  is. Yeah, exactly. And so we need these people to start breaking ranks. And, you know, we're
[2:15:14.960 --> 2:15:21.200]  starting to see, you know, just the start of it. There's some very, very brave doctors who have come
[2:15:21.200 --> 2:15:26.080]  out, more are coming out now. By the way, every doctor I privately know says all of this, including
[2:15:26.080 --> 2:15:30.800]  a major biotech owner in Austin, a billionaire, but they're scared to say it. And they said it
[2:15:30.800 --> 2:15:34.720]  doesn't even exist. You can't get antibodies for it. There can't be a vaccine because your body
[2:15:34.720 --> 2:15:41.040]  doesn't even recognize COVID-19 as a threat. It's a cold virus that gates patented so he could own
[2:15:41.040 --> 2:15:45.440]  it. So when you're found to have it, he can say you're a criminal and lock your ass up. This guy's
[2:15:45.440 --> 2:15:49.520]  a billionaire tech owner and won't come on the show, though. David, I've met with him.
[2:15:50.720 --> 2:15:59.920]  Well, let me just put this bloody virus into perspective. Recently, the CDC published an
[2:15:59.920 --> 2:16:06.080]  article by a group of virologists, and they didn't, you know, come out and say what I'm going to say.
[2:16:06.080 --> 2:16:17.040]  But what they said was saying this in their text. They have isolated or not, they're not isolated.
[2:16:17.040 --> 2:16:27.200]  They say they've identified 37 base pairs of the genetics of SARS-CoV-2. How many base pairs do they
[2:16:27.200 --> 2:16:34.800]  say it has? 30 bloody thousand. And so what they've done is they've taken these little fragments of
[2:16:34.800 --> 2:16:40.880]  what they claim is the virus. And then they've used a computer program. This is all in these articles,
[2:16:41.600 --> 2:16:48.000]  a computer program to fill in the rest. And it was brilliantly described this process by an American
[2:16:48.000 --> 2:16:57.120]  doctor, Tom Cowan, when he said it's like this. You find a fragment of a hoof. You find a fragment
[2:16:57.120 --> 2:17:05.520]  of a horn. And you find a hair from a tail. And then you put it through a computer program and get
[2:17:05.520 --> 2:17:12.480]  it to fill in the gaps. And you say, oh, look, it's a unicorn and a unicorn that no one's ever
[2:17:12.480 --> 2:17:18.080]  bloody seen. And what they did, and this is in the article as well, is because these different
[2:17:18.080 --> 2:17:24.000]  computer programs are filled in the gaps in different ways. I mean, you couldn't make it up.
[2:17:24.000 --> 2:17:30.960]  You don't have to. They then had a vote on, as Cowan said, which of the imaginary unicorns is
[2:17:30.960 --> 2:17:37.920]  the real imaginary unicorn? Exactly. And that is the so-called genetic code of this non-existent
[2:17:37.920 --> 2:17:41.360]  virus. Well, that's an example. Depending on the test, they admit like some have got a bacterial
[2:17:41.360 --> 2:17:45.120]  infection that's false positive, or you've had a coronavirus, or you've had a flu virus. I mean,
[2:17:45.120 --> 2:17:53.520]  it's all just a scam. And so you have a situation where you've not isolated the virus. You've not
[2:17:53.520 --> 2:18:00.400]  identified as genetic code. So how can you, how can you test for it with a test that doesn't test
[2:18:00.400 --> 2:18:05.840]  a virus? And remember, early on, the UN, remember, would not ever put the code out. And they still
[2:18:05.840 --> 2:18:09.680]  won't put the code out for COVID. But they never say what it is because no one's allowed to test.
[2:18:09.680 --> 2:18:15.520]  It's all, it's incredible. Why didn't they launch a real bio attack then, David? Because, I mean,
[2:18:15.520 --> 2:18:18.960]  even Bill Gates said a few months ago on Colbert, he said, oh, this is a beta test,
[2:18:18.960 --> 2:18:22.000]  the real attacks coming, which I believe him on that. But why didn't they
[2:18:22.000 --> 2:18:25.840]  launch something real? They want to just test the psychology of this first?
[2:18:26.880 --> 2:18:33.280]  Well, if you release a real bio weapon, then you're going to lose control of it.
[2:18:34.160 --> 2:18:37.600]  You might take out lots of people, you don't want taking out because although this
[2:18:37.600 --> 2:18:42.240]  culture is core, you probably get it into a single room. There are lots of people within
[2:18:42.240 --> 2:18:47.840]  the hierarchy that don't really know what they're part of. So they don't want to disrupt their network.
[2:18:47.840 --> 2:18:57.360]  They don't want to take them out. And also, if you have that, you are limited to what it does
[2:18:58.160 --> 2:19:04.160]  and where it goes. Whereas if you have a made up virus, you have a blank sheet of paper.
[2:19:04.160 --> 2:19:06.880]  You can use statistics however you want to manipulate.
[2:19:07.600 --> 2:19:11.760]  Like, you can make it go up, you can make it go down, you can increase the number of symptoms.
[2:19:11.760 --> 2:19:14.960]  You can never defeat it. It's just whatever you want.
[2:19:14.960 --> 2:19:20.800]  Because it doesn't exist. It absolutely doesn't exist. I've done enormous amounts of research on
[2:19:20.800 --> 2:19:28.480]  this. It doesn't exist. And what you said is absolutely right. There is not a single scientific
[2:19:28.480 --> 2:19:37.360]  paper in the world to this day that has produced the genetic code without all this computer mumbo
[2:19:37.360 --> 2:19:39.760]  jumbo. But every other virus, they've got the exact code.
[2:19:39.760 --> 2:19:47.040]  Well, it's very difficult to get the codes of viruses. That's a whole other story. There's
[2:19:47.040 --> 2:19:50.080]  enormous amounts of evidence. People don't realize this, of course.
[2:19:50.080 --> 2:19:52.480]  Sure that it's a byproduct of cellular regeneration.
[2:19:53.120 --> 2:19:58.720]  That viruses don't cause disease. It's a response of the immune system.
[2:19:58.720 --> 2:20:05.760]  It's that what we call viruses are released as a response to cells being poisoned, not by
[2:20:05.760 --> 2:20:10.080]  electromagnetic fields, food, whatever. And so, what they've done...
[2:20:10.080 --> 2:20:14.960]  Well, you're right. They actually have studies on 5G, 4G, 3G that the body actually gives off
[2:20:15.840 --> 2:20:20.880]  different chemicals that look like viruses when they're under bombardment. David, you're amazing.
[2:20:21.600 --> 2:20:25.360]  Please come back again in the aftermath of the election. You've been very nice to join us.
[2:20:25.360 --> 2:20:27.520]  Maybe you'll come back in a few days. Maybe next week. We really...
[2:20:27.520 --> 2:20:29.120]  That's not a problem though, yeah.
[2:20:29.120 --> 2:20:32.800]  Oh, we'd love it. So, join us then tomorrow the next day. You tell my producer when you
[2:20:32.800 --> 2:20:36.640]  want on-serve. The show's yours. DavidIke.com. Thank you so much. Amazing information. Thank you.
[2:20:37.360 --> 2:20:37.920]  Cheers, Alex.
[2:20:37.920 --> 2:20:40.880]  Well, that was powerful. I love DavidIke. We'll get right back with Jim Hoff.
[2:20:42.240 --> 2:20:48.320]  Infowars has been reporting on the dark, unpleasant truths of big government corruption
[2:20:48.320 --> 2:20:54.880]  for over two decades. It is why they attack us. And it is why we are now the most banned
[2:20:54.880 --> 2:21:01.440]  broadcast in the world. The Hunter Biden hard drive scandal is merely the tip of the iceberg.
[2:21:01.440 --> 2:21:08.400]  Evil has infested governments everywhere. But the evil establishment is censoring content across
[2:21:08.400 --> 2:21:14.560]  all media platforms. They blocked you from sharing banned.video on social media. So,
[2:21:14.560 --> 2:21:20.480]  go to electionnight.news and share it like your lives depended on it.
[2:21:21.920 --> 2:21:30.160]  Go to electionnight.news to find the truth about COVID, vaccines, Bill Gates, and Big Pharma.
[2:21:30.160 --> 2:21:35.920]  Go to electionnight.news to find all the information the crooked establishment
[2:21:35.920 --> 2:22:01.920]  is most afraid of. Go to electionnight.news and share now.
[2:22:05.920 --> 2:22:10.480]  This is the highest quality and strongest you're going to find. So, both these are amazing products
[2:22:10.480 --> 2:22:15.840]  and they fund the Infowar, which is a 360 win. On top of it, despite the fact they're in demand,
[2:22:15.840 --> 2:22:21.520]  they've been sold out for months, they're both 50% off, triple Patriot points,
[2:22:21.520 --> 2:22:27.360]  and free shipping at infowarstore.com. That's bio, true selenium. From the mustard seed,
[2:22:27.360 --> 2:22:32.240]  it's amazing. And on top of it, we also have bodies, ultimate turmeric formula,
[2:22:32.240 --> 2:22:37.440]  at infowarstore.com. This cell will not last long, but thank you all for your support and
[2:22:37.440 --> 2:22:40.800]  really to try these products. People absolutely love them because they really, really work.
[2:22:40.800 --> 2:22:45.040]  infowarstore.com. Remember, don't worry, be happy, everything's going to be all right.
[2:22:46.080 --> 2:22:52.400]  Over and over, you're ever told. Let the technocracies spy on you. Let big tech control what you do.
[2:22:52.400 --> 2:22:58.000]  They will never abuse their power. They will never hurt you. And just as soon as they got their global
[2:22:58.000 --> 2:23:04.240]  AI grid in, they used communist China as the beta test to sell the world on a dystopic martial law
[2:23:04.240 --> 2:23:08.800]  lockdown. When it all started eight, nine months ago, I told you it's never going to end. They're
[2:23:08.800 --> 2:23:13.520]  never going to lose this power. They're going to make you have internal passports on your phones
[2:23:14.320 --> 2:23:18.320]  to leave your house, to have a job, to travel. They're going to add more and more restrictions
[2:23:18.320 --> 2:23:24.240]  on of how you hit that travel pass. Remember, The Running Man, the Schwarzenegger movie,
[2:23:24.240 --> 2:23:29.040]  the mid 80s written by Stephen King about a future police state. Watch that movie and
[2:23:29.040 --> 2:23:37.840]  then compare it to today. We are in the absolute brand, the absolute mold of a classic authoritarian
[2:23:37.840 --> 2:23:55.280]  dystopic nightmare. We've got to reject this now before it's submitted. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:23:55.280 --> 2:24:10.640]  All right, Jim Hofke. We're getting him on Skype right now on this live November 3rd. Wow,
[2:24:10.640 --> 2:24:16.480]  global edition. Can't believe we are here live. Let's look at a few fun things though for TV
[2:24:16.480 --> 2:24:22.000]  viewers. Radio listeners, I'll describe these for you. No one looks more disingenuous. I'm not going
[2:24:22.000 --> 2:24:26.720]  to say Comey looks like a pedophile. He doesn't. But I was going to hire somebody to play Eddie Haskell
[2:24:26.720 --> 2:24:33.520]  part two and then leave it to Beaver or somebody to be a fraud or use car salesman. It would be
[2:24:33.520 --> 2:24:41.520]  James Comey and he's put out on Twitter, vote for your country with a Biden Harris 2020. Remember,
[2:24:41.520 --> 2:24:47.200]  he was the nonpartisan Republican. All this BS. Look at the disingenuousness of this eight foot
[2:24:47.200 --> 2:24:57.200]  tall weirdo. Meanwhile, I like this. It's 2032. The globalist unleashed their clone army to enslave
[2:24:57.200 --> 2:25:03.200]  the earth. But a leader rises up to unite mankind for one last stand. That's some fun stuff.
[2:25:04.960 --> 2:25:10.160]  Well, we got so many other big guests that are coming up as well. Roger Stone
[2:25:10.160 --> 2:25:15.840]  is coming up. Paul Joseph Watson. Who knows? We might have Joe Rogan on today. Who knows what's
[2:25:15.840 --> 2:25:21.040]  going on? A lot of wildness is going down. Before we go to Jim Hoft here, who are finally getting
[2:25:21.040 --> 2:25:28.000]  on Skype. DNA Force Plus, if you did one thing for your immune system, it would be get all the
[2:25:28.000 --> 2:25:35.760]  essential things. And that's the clean iodine X2 or X3. That's the bio tricillinium. That is the
[2:25:35.760 --> 2:25:41.600]  vitamin D3. That is the C. That is the zinc. There's 13 vitamins and minerals that are essential
[2:25:41.600 --> 2:25:46.960]  without them. You die. And studies show you really need the other ones too. But DNA force goes
[2:25:46.960 --> 2:25:51.920]  beyond that. It helps get all that in the cells and out the cells with PQQ and CoQ10 of the highest
[2:25:51.920 --> 2:25:57.840]  quality sources with other ingredients that clean out the cells, that unclog them so all that stuff
[2:25:57.840 --> 2:26:04.640]  can get in. Viruses don't get in. The good stuff gets in. As the NIH website says, that if you have
[2:26:04.640 --> 2:26:09.440]  all the proper things, they can't replicate like they could. But I do this because it's essential,
[2:26:09.440 --> 2:26:13.760]  like oxygen, like water. DNA force sold out for months, 50% off out of the gates.
[2:26:13.760 --> 2:26:21.120]  Triple Patriot points, free shipping, infoorstore.com. DNA force, election special. That's going to
[2:26:21.120 --> 2:26:25.520]  have to end in a week. We've got a limited supply. It was very hard to get the PQQ this time. A lot
[2:26:25.520 --> 2:26:29.120]  of our stuff can't get any more. A lot of our products, because the supply chain is broken
[2:26:29.120 --> 2:26:33.680]  down. That's part of the global's plan. Also, the big Black Friday special comes in October.
[2:26:33.680 --> 2:26:38.000]  Well, it's not October anymore. That's got to end. So, the amount of mineral fusion, the ultra-12,
[2:26:38.000 --> 2:26:41.920]  also amazing. Those discounts are about to end with free shipping and all the rest of it.
[2:26:41.920 --> 2:26:45.280]  Infoorstore.com. Bodies, Ultimate Turbulent Formula, back in stock.
[2:26:46.400 --> 2:26:52.080]  It's all there. Infoorstore.com or triple 82533139. I want to thank you all for tuning in. All right.
[2:26:52.720 --> 2:26:58.080]  Jim Hoffs with us in the next 20 minutes. Nobody. And I love admiring somebody because it means,
[2:26:58.080 --> 2:27:02.160]  my God, when I'm exhausted and I want to fight hard, it's like the Energizer bunnies over there
[2:27:02.160 --> 2:27:07.920]  putting out 10 times the articles we do and just catching everything there is. And so,
[2:27:07.920 --> 2:27:15.360]  my spirit animal is Gateway Pundit. And he joins us, always ear to the ground. White House loves
[2:27:15.360 --> 2:27:19.680]  what he's doing. All the election fraud, all the craziness. I could ask a thousand questions,
[2:27:19.680 --> 2:27:23.360]  but I want to give him the floor. Whatever he's got up front, then I want to ask him
[2:27:24.240 --> 2:27:28.640]  gut level what he sees happening tonight. Because they admit plan A is just to have the
[2:27:28.640 --> 2:27:32.960]  media announced that Biden's won, even though he hasn't, that if Trump tries to talk censoring him
[2:27:32.960 --> 2:27:36.880]  and plan B is hold up everything with a ballot. So, Jim, I said, I'm not going to ask a question,
[2:27:36.880 --> 2:27:39.760]  but up front, it's great to have you. What do you want to go at first here?
[2:27:41.040 --> 2:27:47.200]  Well, I think that the Biden campaign is in a complete panic today. I'm feeling really good
[2:27:47.200 --> 2:27:54.000]  about the election right now. I know that the fraud is there. Alex, we know that the fraud is
[2:27:54.000 --> 2:27:59.840]  always baked in. But this time, what's different is we have President Trump, and he's aware of this,
[2:27:59.840 --> 2:28:06.560]  and his followers are aware of this. And I think it actually cuts down on some of that potential
[2:28:06.560 --> 2:28:13.360]  fraud. I know a lot of people might disagree. We know it's well known landslides override fraud.
[2:28:14.240 --> 2:28:20.720]  That's it. And the numbers we're seeing so far from Florida, especially,
[2:28:20.720 --> 2:28:26.560]  there's some good Twitter users down there who are posting updates about every 15, 20 minutes.
[2:28:27.120 --> 2:28:33.360]  Florida looks great. And President Trump was just speaking a bit ago, saying Florida,
[2:28:33.360 --> 2:28:40.400]  North Carolina, Texas, and Arizona, the numbers look good so far. So, they're very upbeat.
[2:28:40.400 --> 2:28:46.800]  It was a nice sign last night in Kenosha, Wisconsin, when the Trump kids got on stage,
[2:28:46.800 --> 2:28:56.080]  and they were upbeat. I think that says a lot. And the fact that Joe Biden and his campaign
[2:28:56.080 --> 2:29:01.360]  is already backpedaling, saying that maybe Pennsylvania isn't that necessary. Maybe they
[2:29:01.360 --> 2:29:06.640]  don't need Florida. That says a lot. So, once again, Alex, they've been feeding us this
[2:29:06.640 --> 2:29:12.320]  bull of crap for months, saying that Joe Biden was way ahead of our man Donald Trump,
[2:29:12.320 --> 2:29:18.080]  and it was just complete garbage. And unfortunately for Democrats and for Joe Biden,
[2:29:18.080 --> 2:29:20.960]  they believe the fake news media. So, shame on them.
[2:29:22.720 --> 2:29:26.480]  And, Jim, I know you're a realist. You wouldn't be putting a pretty picture on this if you didn't
[2:29:26.480 --> 2:29:30.720]  smell victory. I smell it too, but the media is so corrupt. They might just announce that Biden
[2:29:30.720 --> 2:29:35.120]  wins. They're saying that's the plan, even if he's losing. Right. We saw that yesterday,
[2:29:35.120 --> 2:29:42.800]  the official from Pennsylvania saying that about Joe Biden. And it was interesting, too, today,
[2:29:42.800 --> 2:29:48.880]  when Trump was visiting his campaign staff in Arlington, Virginia, the question, of course,
[2:29:48.880 --> 2:29:53.600]  the first question from the fake news media was, did you write your concession speech?
[2:29:53.600 --> 2:29:59.040]  And Trump's response was, no, hell no. He hasn't written that. He has no intention of writing
[2:29:59.040 --> 2:30:03.440]  a concession speech. And I don't think he's going to need one. Only the fake news media
[2:30:03.440 --> 2:30:09.440]  wants you to believe this. And Alex, I got to hand it to you at InfoWars. You guys have been
[2:30:09.440 --> 2:30:17.040]  attacked more than anyone in the past four years since Trump's last victory. And it's been a hard
[2:30:17.040 --> 2:30:21.760]  go for you. It's been hard for us. I can't wait upon it. But you know, your voice is still as
[2:30:21.760 --> 2:30:30.880]  strong as ever. And you guys are just kicking ass. And I know that you have a lot of support and a
[2:30:30.880 --> 2:30:35.600]  lot of readers and viewers who are with you every day. So they're the reason we're still on air,
[2:30:35.600 --> 2:30:40.560]  just like you, that they deserve all the credit. Let me ask you this. What do you expect the left
[2:30:40.560 --> 2:30:45.440]  to do? I think it's clearly the metrics are all there. Trump's going to win big. What are they
[2:30:45.440 --> 2:30:49.680]  going to do? I mean, we know they're planning all this violence, but gut level, what does Jim
[2:30:49.680 --> 2:30:55.760]  Hoff expect to happen? You know, I think I was thinking, what is it going to happen? When are
[2:30:55.760 --> 2:31:03.520]  these people going to hit the streets? I live in the St. Louis area up in Missouri. And I suspect
[2:31:03.520 --> 2:31:10.560]  maybe not tonight. I think it depends on how big the Trump win is. But I do expect in the next few
[2:31:10.560 --> 2:31:16.320]  nights that they're going to be a lot of these radical violent leftists out again, the Antifa
[2:31:16.320 --> 2:31:23.120]  folks. It is interesting that every city has their stores boarded up again, which you know,
[2:31:23.120 --> 2:31:28.800]  is costing these stores a fortune, just protecting themselves from Antifa. But it is
[2:31:28.800 --> 2:31:36.000]  interesting that every major city this is happening in, and these poor, this poor leadership by
[2:31:36.000 --> 2:31:42.640]  Democrats, that they won't put a stop to this. And they allow this to continue month after month.
[2:31:43.200 --> 2:31:48.880]  So I think that's a lot, a big boost for Donald Trump. But no, I agree. Isn't it just a giant
[2:31:48.880 --> 2:31:53.280]  temper tantrum? That's what I'm asking. If we've seen all these temper tantrum so far, how do they
[2:31:53.280 --> 2:31:59.840]  up the level when they've already turned it up to 11? Yeah, yeah, I mean, I'm afraid to see what
[2:31:59.840 --> 2:32:06.320]  they do next. We've already seen, you know, we've seen a lot of Alex on and you don't have to use
[2:32:06.320 --> 2:32:13.040]  your imagination. I just hope that there is a tough response. I hope that Trump fires that
[2:32:13.040 --> 2:32:20.880]  Secretary of Defense Esper at midnight tonight. The same, the same Trump official who said
[2:32:20.880 --> 2:32:27.440]  he felt uncomfortable sitting in the National Guard on protesters, right? And so I hope he's
[2:32:27.440 --> 2:32:30.720]  gone at midnight. Trump needs somebody in there who's going to protect our cities.
[2:32:31.280 --> 2:32:35.840]  Well, that was my next question when we come back. Let's just start now. What does Trump need to do
[2:32:35.840 --> 2:32:41.360]  when he wins? Because we better see some major action. He's talking about firing Ray, a bunch of
[2:32:41.360 --> 2:32:48.400]  people. Yeah, well, I hope that this the Secretary of Defense is first. I hope Christopher Ray is
[2:32:48.400 --> 2:32:54.640]  second. That guy's a disaster. It would be nice if we saw some of these people get charged.
[2:32:55.760 --> 2:33:01.840]  The CIA director, we're not sure what the hell she does, but we haven't seen much. It'd be nice
[2:33:01.840 --> 2:33:09.360]  maybe if Gina Haspel left. And so, you know, I think that's the first thing he has to do. And I
[2:33:09.360 --> 2:33:16.960]  think a lot of people are even talking about our Attorney General, maybe canning him because we
[2:33:16.960 --> 2:33:22.400]  haven't seen anything so far from these investigations. Yeah, he's talked a lot of good talk, but the
[2:33:22.400 --> 2:33:26.960]  action is not there. Talk is talk. Walking is the walk. All right, one more segment.
[2:33:26.960 --> 2:33:32.480]  Absolutely. We'll ask him more about what's coming up, other angles he's looking at,
[2:33:33.120 --> 2:33:36.080]  and just where this country goes. There's any way to heal this.
[2:33:36.080 --> 2:33:39.440]  Once the Democrats have been defeated, stay with us.
[2:33:41.360 --> 2:33:46.800]  Look it up for yourself. The head of the Davos group issued a report one six months ago calling
[2:33:46.800 --> 2:33:52.880]  for world government to be openly established to respond to COVID-19. The COVID-19 was a
[2:33:52.880 --> 2:33:58.880]  blessing to lower the planet's carbon footprint. Since then, Prince Charles and countless others
[2:33:58.880 --> 2:34:05.040]  have come out and said the exact same thing. The most ancient form of total war is called
[2:34:05.040 --> 2:34:11.680]  siege. That's when you cut people off from their resources. That's when you lock them down.
[2:34:12.480 --> 2:34:16.160]  And this isn't siege to make us capitulate to the globalist or just get rid of Donald Trump.
[2:34:16.160 --> 2:34:21.360]  That's only part of it. This is siege to literally train us to be poor and to get us into deep debt.
[2:34:21.360 --> 2:34:27.360]  So then the globalist social engineers can dictate how we live our lives with the social
[2:34:27.360 --> 2:34:32.560]  credit score surveillance script. You've heard the US Army saying our job is to kill people
[2:34:32.560 --> 2:34:36.640]  and break things. Well, that's what the lockdown is doing. It's starving the third world, millions
[2:34:36.640 --> 2:34:40.400]  and millions of debt. It's breaking down the supply chain in society. It's their mission.
[2:34:41.440 --> 2:34:48.640]  It's all on record. Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, they were all hired a year ago.
[2:34:49.280 --> 2:34:54.400]  And then again, six months ago to war game, how to get the public to stay locked down during a
[2:34:54.400 --> 2:34:59.440]  pandemic and how to get the public to take inoculations. And they talk about calling people
[2:34:59.440 --> 2:35:04.640]  heroes that do it. They talk about shaming those that don't. This has all been psychologically
[2:35:04.640 --> 2:35:10.240]  tested. It's all been psychologically prepared. And once they get it locked down for 15 days,
[2:35:10.240 --> 2:35:15.280]  you notice now they say it's permanent. That's how it works. Oh, just put these handcuffs on.
[2:35:15.280 --> 2:35:19.680]  The serial killer says the woman in the parking lot and everything will be all right. No.
[2:35:20.400 --> 2:35:26.640]  Now we've already put the handcuffs on and we're in the serial killer's van. He's taking us to his
[2:35:26.640 --> 2:35:31.600]  shack in the woods to slowly torture us to death. That's the allegory. We got to bust out of this
[2:35:31.600 --> 2:35:36.240]  thing now. We got to say no now. We got to make a run for it now when we still can. Once he gets us
[2:35:36.240 --> 2:35:42.720]  in that base, but it's going to get a lot, lot worse, folks. So stop submitting. The miraculous
[2:35:42.720 --> 2:35:47.920]  properties of turmeric have been admired and even worshiped for thousands of years by ancient
[2:35:47.920 --> 2:35:54.400]  civilizations. With modern science, we know why turmeric is so popular. It's antioxidant effect.
[2:35:54.400 --> 2:36:00.880]  It's anti-inflammatory effect. Everything it does is simply amazing. And most turmerics out
[2:36:00.880 --> 2:36:07.920]  there are simply food products. They're three to five percent curcuminoid, but we have body's
[2:36:07.920 --> 2:36:15.520]  ultimate turmeric formula with a 95% curcuminoid level. And we have other organic products in

[2:38:01.200 --> 2:38:06.800]  Live from the Infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[2:38:31.200 --> 2:38:46.320]  You've been right there with the first people to say it's a total fraud. It's a hoax. They're
[2:38:46.320 --> 2:38:52.480]  putting other deaths on there. Sure it's a real virus, but totally exaggerated. Now they admit
[2:38:52.480 --> 2:38:58.400]  what you and your brother spearheaded. New York Times in hunt for virus sources, WHO lets China
[2:38:58.400 --> 2:39:05.120]  take charge. So it is China running the response. Trump's right. And then all the big lockdowns and
[2:39:05.120 --> 2:39:10.480]  the left keeping their cities closed. I'm sure that when Trump wins, they're just going to keep
[2:39:10.480 --> 2:39:16.480]  Blue City shut down as a form of siege and it breaks the federal system. So your take on where
[2:39:16.480 --> 2:39:21.920]  this lockdown is going is four more years, no more masks, except the bureaucracy, the Democrats,
[2:39:21.920 --> 2:39:26.640]  the Blue States, the corporations, the universities, they're just going to keep it going. So Trump's
[2:39:26.640 --> 2:39:32.480]  not a dictator. He doesn't have the power to stop this. What do we do? Yeah, that's a great question.
[2:39:32.480 --> 2:39:39.200]  You know, I forgot to mention that Dr. Fauci should be canned tonight too after the election results
[2:39:39.200 --> 2:39:44.080]  are announced. That guy's been a complete disaster. He doesn't even, I don't think he could pass a
[2:39:44.080 --> 2:39:50.240]  psychological test. I think the guy's crazy. He's wishy-washy, makes no sense. And he's the one
[2:39:50.240 --> 2:39:55.680]  that not only the US was relying on, but much of the world, much of these developing countries,
[2:39:55.680 --> 2:40:02.400]  use the US plan to defeat this virus. And people like Trump, Trump inherited Fauci. He's been there
[2:40:02.400 --> 2:40:10.160]  45 years. Yeah, yeah. And he needs to be gone. He's a complete disaster. And he ruined this great
[2:40:10.160 --> 2:40:15.440]  economy. He ruined, you know, tens of thousands of people's lives, hundreds of thousands of people's
[2:40:15.440 --> 2:40:22.320]  lives by destroying their incomes, destroying their businesses they had. So yeah, I hope that guy's
[2:40:22.320 --> 2:40:28.560]  gone real soon. I hope charges are brought up against him. And I hope Trump puts in a few
[2:40:29.200 --> 2:40:33.760]  doctors that we can trust who actually make some sense because this has been, you know,
[2:40:33.760 --> 2:40:40.000]  that Fauci, as we listed on Gateway Pond, we have a list of at least 19 times this guy made
[2:40:40.000 --> 2:40:49.520]  absolutely no sense or was lying or was, you know, wishy-washy with his policies.
[2:40:49.520 --> 2:40:55.920]  And now he's campaigning for Biden openly. Don't you think Comey and Fauci campaigning for Biden
[2:40:55.920 --> 2:41:03.840]  hurts Biden? These people are jokes. Yeah, yeah. I think it tells us everything we already knew.
[2:41:03.840 --> 2:41:11.120]  And that is that these people were just there to take down Trump. And so, you know, that'll be
[2:41:11.120 --> 2:41:16.160]  one thing that happens. But I think right now the numbers for Trump look really good. I'm really
[2:41:16.160 --> 2:41:24.240]  happy about that so far, Alex. And we will see. But I noticed we put up a story a few minutes ago,
[2:41:24.240 --> 2:41:30.640]  North Carolina, they're keeping some polling stations open late today. So, of course, you know,
[2:41:30.640 --> 2:41:36.160]  we're going to see these shenanigans like you were saying. Some friends of mine, as far as Missouri,
[2:41:36.160 --> 2:41:40.720]  which is, you know, pretty solid read at this point, thanks to Barack Obama, it used to be a
[2:41:40.720 --> 2:41:47.440]  swing state. Now it's really red and Trump. But the lines down in southern Missouri, which is a
[2:41:47.440 --> 2:41:53.600]  stronghold for Republicans are like, he said it was a half mile long, but at least a quarter mile.
[2:41:53.600 --> 2:42:01.280]  And that's, you know, that's great news. So, God is going to save this country once again
[2:42:01.280 --> 2:42:08.640]  with President Trump. And I'm glad that you guys have been there the whole time. And you've been
[2:42:08.640 --> 2:42:14.800]  taking so much heat. So, I'm glad that you guys are still standing and going strong. So, Jim,
[2:42:14.800 --> 2:42:18.960]  off to sleep at night, feeling good knowing you and many others like Roger Stone are there. Look
[2:42:18.960 --> 2:42:23.040]  forward to talking to the next few days, hopefully with a big Trump win. And it's so decisive.
[2:42:23.040 --> 2:42:27.680]  They don't drag this out. Thank you so much. And gateway punnet.com. Thanks, Alex. All right,
[2:42:27.680 --> 2:42:31.520]  the gateway punnet.com. Thank you, Jim. All right, joining us now for the next 20 minutes is Roger
[2:42:31.520 --> 2:42:36.160]  Stone. He'll be back on several times throughout the evening. And obviously that critical time,
[2:42:36.160 --> 2:42:40.080]  we've got to get champagne together when Trump's announced the winner. That may not be happening,
[2:42:40.080 --> 2:42:43.760]  though. Roger, I want to give you the floor of whatever you think is most important up front
[2:42:43.760 --> 2:42:47.840]  now. But then I want to ask you, when you're done answering, say whatever you want to say,
[2:42:47.840 --> 2:42:53.120]  because you're the expert more than I am, way more. Plan A, they're going to announce Biden's
[2:42:53.120 --> 2:42:57.520]  winner tonight. The mainstream media they've said is the only voice that matters. They say that he's
[2:42:57.520 --> 2:43:02.000]  going to quote, take command in it. That's plan A. Plan B, they're going to drag it out. What do
[2:43:02.000 --> 2:43:07.680]  you expect them to try to execute? Or is there a plan C? Well, Alex, first of all, I'm delighted
[2:43:07.680 --> 2:43:12.800]  to be with you and good to see my good friend Jim Hoff there. He's really a courageous journalist.
[2:43:12.800 --> 2:43:19.440]  And other than info wars, the gateway pundit was one of the few outlets that actually told the
[2:43:19.440 --> 2:43:25.440]  American people about the truth when I was being subjected to a Soviet style show trial. And we're
[2:43:25.440 --> 2:43:29.600]  going to cover that next hour. It's now come out confirming that Mueller was investigating you day
[2:43:29.600 --> 2:43:36.640]  one during the campaign along with Julian Assange. Well, and more importantly, at midnight last night,
[2:43:36.640 --> 2:43:43.440]  at midnight, the Department of Justice released the unredacted sections of the Mueller report
[2:43:43.440 --> 2:43:49.600]  demonstrating undisputedly that they had no evidence whatsoever that I was involved with
[2:43:49.600 --> 2:43:55.600]  WikiLeaks in the hacking or dissemination of that information. My lawyers tell me that should have
[2:43:55.600 --> 2:44:04.720]  been disclosed to me under the law prior to my trial under the Brady requirements. And you
[2:44:04.720 --> 2:44:09.520]  don't under federal law and state law that if someone is found not guilty and set up,
[2:44:09.520 --> 2:44:15.840]  even if they don't challenge it in court, the court should reopen it and exonerate you immediately.
[2:44:16.960 --> 2:44:22.080]  You're right, Alex, but we're talking about the District of Columbia. So I would say that chance.
[2:44:22.080 --> 2:44:29.440]  No Republican, no conservative, no Trump supporter, no Christian, no libertarian
[2:44:29.440 --> 2:44:36.320]  could ever receive a fair trial in the D.C. Circuit. It is completely and thoroughly corrupt.
[2:44:36.320 --> 2:44:42.640]  Look at the process involving that great American patriot, General Mike Flynn.
[2:44:43.280 --> 2:44:49.920]  Today, the Democrats went to Judge Emmett Sullivan to get his approval for further extension of
[2:44:49.920 --> 2:44:57.680]  voting in various jurisdictions. He is the go-to judge for the deep state. Both he and Judge Jackson
[2:44:57.680 --> 2:45:04.640]  will face impeachment proceedings if the president is reelectioned and the House Republicans take
[2:45:04.640 --> 2:45:11.840]  control. It's time for deep, deep reform of our federal judiciary. Let's get to the election,
[2:45:11.840 --> 2:45:16.960]  because I think that's what people want to talk about. Alex, I am growingly optimistic based on
[2:45:16.960 --> 2:45:24.080]  what I am seeing. We have been fighting, as I've said, a number of structural obstacles to the
[2:45:24.080 --> 2:45:33.120]  president's reelection. It's not just the mainstream media and the constant torrent of lies attacking
[2:45:33.120 --> 2:45:41.600]  the president, not to mention their active censorship regarding the undisputed evidence
[2:45:41.600 --> 2:45:48.960]  of criminal activity by Joe and Hunter Biden involving foreign enemies. In 2016, this was
[2:45:48.960 --> 2:45:57.840]  really not problematic, because the robust, vibrant alternative media that had grown based
[2:45:57.840 --> 2:46:04.960]  in the Internet was an end around for Donald Trump. It was a way to launch his counterattack
[2:46:04.960 --> 2:46:11.760]  and have his counterattack be widely covered and widely understood. Now they have censored
[2:46:12.800 --> 2:46:18.480]  conservatives, Christians, Republicans, info wars, Stone Cold Truth.com,
[2:46:19.600 --> 2:46:26.080]  so many others on the Internet. That is extraordinarily problematic. The Democrats'
[2:46:26.080 --> 2:46:32.240]  game plan, I think, is absolutely clear. If they do not get the result they want tonight,
[2:46:32.240 --> 2:46:37.440]  there's a great story in the British newspapers. Black Lives Matter has said they will burn
[2:46:37.440 --> 2:46:42.240]  Washington to the ground, they will burn the White House to the ground, and they will put as
[2:46:42.240 --> 2:46:50.320]  many effing police officers in their graves as possible. I have to assume that with the election
[2:46:50.320 --> 2:46:57.680]  behind him, the president recognizes that when he took the oath of office, he specifically pledged
[2:46:57.680 --> 2:47:04.400]  to protect this country from all enemies, domestic and foreign. And therefore, it is the
[2:47:04.400 --> 2:47:12.880]  president's first obligation to protect the public safety and to preserve order. If there is widespread
[2:47:12.880 --> 2:47:17.280]  violence- No, I mean, I agree. At a certain point, it doesn't matter if they say it's an agitprop.
[2:47:17.280 --> 2:47:20.160]  If people start randomly killing and burning again, they've got to be dealt with.
[2:47:21.040 --> 2:47:25.440]  There's no question. But, you know, when we say that, they try to turn it with us and say,
[2:47:25.440 --> 2:47:31.680]  oh, Stone and Jones says if Trump loses, he should enact martial law. We never said that.
[2:47:31.680 --> 2:47:37.200]  That's not what we're saying right here and now. The president's on the way to victory, Alex. When
[2:47:37.200 --> 2:47:44.000]  we come back, we'll talk about several scenarios and how I see them playing out. In the meantime,
[2:47:44.800 --> 2:47:50.400]  I was in Georgia yesterday to endorse Doug Collins for the United States Senate. If you're an info
[2:47:50.400 --> 2:47:56.480]  warrior and you are listening and you live in Georgia, please get to the polls and vote for
[2:47:56.480 --> 2:48:03.040]  Doug Collins. He is a true patriot who will support the president and his opponent, Kelly Loeffler,
[2:48:03.040 --> 2:48:08.880]  is a globalist. Well, that's right. Let's go back. Let's go back. Let's go back. We've got to go
[2:48:08.880 --> 2:48:13.840]  to break Roger, but you're right. Last election midterm and the one before that, a lot of House
[2:48:13.840 --> 2:48:18.400]  members and people only won by a few thousand votes. People need to not just go vote in Georgia
[2:48:18.400 --> 2:48:23.280]  and every other state. They need to bring people now. Get off your asses and do it.
[2:48:23.280 --> 2:48:27.280]  I'm not bitching at people. I'm just saying this is it. God, I don't want a physical civil war.
[2:48:27.280 --> 2:48:34.240]  Let's fix this beastly now. Election 2020 is here and whether Trump wins or loses,
[2:48:35.040 --> 2:48:40.000]  we have all won by exposing the common Chinese, by exposing the globalist, by exposing the
[2:48:40.000 --> 2:48:45.600]  pedophile rings, by exposing the fact this is really a fight between good versus evil.
[2:48:45.600 --> 2:48:49.760]  Now, I'm personally a Christian and I believe in God and I know God's real and I've experienced
[2:48:49.760 --> 2:48:54.320]  it in my life. Believe me, I don't believe in God. It's important to recognize that there is
[2:48:54.320 --> 2:48:58.320]  good in this world. There is evil and there are people out there that want to do you harm because
[2:48:58.320 --> 2:49:04.640]  they enjoy doing that. And what I see happening across the spectrum of different political views
[2:49:04.640 --> 2:49:09.600]  is people finally get that. They finally understand that they're not being naive anymore.
[2:49:09.600 --> 2:49:16.560]  Don't ever project your decency and your goodness onto other people until they've proven what they
[2:49:16.560 --> 2:49:20.640]  stand for and who they are or you're going to get hurt. But those of you out there that have
[2:49:20.640 --> 2:49:24.880]  done your own research and discovered who's good and who is faithful will then come together
[2:49:24.880 --> 2:49:30.240]  with those organizations and support them like info wars. Without your support, info wars would not
[2:49:30.240 --> 2:49:37.760]  exist. The problem with social Darwinism is the so-called elites, the most cunning, smart
[2:49:37.760 --> 2:49:44.800]  inventive people believe that chivalry doesn't exist anymore. They don't believe in being aristocrats.
[2:49:45.360 --> 2:49:49.600]  Turn to hold up civilization and empower the people. And once the establishment has that
[2:49:49.600 --> 2:49:54.320]  predatory idea, civilization collapses very, very quickly. You can't treat the least of us
[2:49:55.040 --> 2:49:59.840]  like garbage and not treat your own family like that. And so it is this lack of empathy that's
[2:49:59.840 --> 2:50:05.440]  going to destroy us. The globalists can try to be heartless devil worshipers that commit rituals
[2:50:05.440 --> 2:50:10.640]  of all sorts of horrible crimes, try to get away from a humanity, but really they can't escape the
[2:50:10.640 --> 2:50:16.160]  laws of the universe. They may train themselves to commit heinous crimes and not feel it themselves,
[2:50:16.160 --> 2:50:21.040]  but the repercussions of what they commit always comes back on them and their families and the
[2:50:21.040 --> 2:50:26.960]  very structure itself. Wealth is created by loving God. Wealth is created by having a connection to God.
[2:50:26.960 --> 2:50:31.760]  God is the source of all creation, all success, all power. If we deny that, you'll be destroyed.
[2:50:31.760 --> 2:50:37.680]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:44.560 --> 2:50:50.560]  It's election day 2020. Roger Stones, our guest, will be back throughout the night with 24-hour
[2:50:50.560 --> 2:50:55.520]  coverage. Roger, you're going to play out the different scenarios for his next segment that
[2:50:55.520 --> 2:51:00.560]  Paul Watson takes over 15 after. But I got to ask you, what is it like, the trials and tribulations
[2:51:00.560 --> 2:51:05.680]  you've been through, trying to get Trump to run for office back in the 90s, being his chief
[2:51:05.680 --> 2:51:11.360]  political advisor, going through the last campaign, 11 campaigns now, being persecuted,
[2:51:11.360 --> 2:51:15.920]  going through the fire, being given clemency, and now being in the middle of 2020 election?
[2:51:15.920 --> 2:51:21.600]  I mean, is this not surreal? Well, Alex, it's great to be completely vindicated,
[2:51:21.600 --> 2:51:26.560]  which is exactly what happened last night at midnight when the Justice Department threw in
[2:51:26.560 --> 2:51:32.960]  the towel and released the entirely unredacted Mueller report showing that the charges against me
[2:51:32.960 --> 2:51:39.520]  were bogus from the beginning and they had no evidence whatsoever. Today, the turds at Media
[2:51:39.520 --> 2:51:46.000]  Matters for America are upset because I said that Brennan, Comey, Clapper, Rosenstein,
[2:51:46.800 --> 2:51:54.080]  et al. should be tried for treason and hung by the neck until dead if convicted.
[2:51:54.080 --> 2:51:59.600]  If they will check the law, they will find out that capital punishment is, by law,
[2:51:59.600 --> 2:52:03.840]  the punishment for treason. That's the punitive response. We don't want that without the courts,
[2:52:03.840 --> 2:52:08.800]  but does this trigger you to see Comey with his Biden-Harris shirt on? Does that trigger you?
[2:52:09.840 --> 2:52:14.960]  Well, what triggers me is the fact that Attorney General Bill Barr has now twice had
[2:52:14.960 --> 2:52:20.720]  Inspector General's recommendations that Mr. Comey be charged with crimes far more serious
[2:52:20.720 --> 2:52:26.160]  than those that I was falsely convicted of, but nothing has happened. On Wednesday,
[2:52:26.160 --> 2:52:31.520]  Mr. Barr needs to resign and be indicted for obstruction of justice himself if he will not
[2:52:31.520 --> 2:52:38.320]  do his duty. We cannot have a two-tier justice system in which patriots like General Michael Flynn
[2:52:38.320 --> 2:52:44.720]  are prosecuted when criminals like John Brennan and James Comey and General Clapper
[2:52:44.720 --> 2:52:52.640]  and Rod Rosenstein are allowed to walk the streets. The American people will not settle for this.
[2:52:52.640 --> 2:52:58.640]  It is time for the president to finally clean house and take action against the traitors.
[2:52:58.640 --> 2:53:05.360]  Now, I suggest that all those people be arrested, be properly charged, be given a fair trial,
[2:53:05.360 --> 2:53:10.560]  something I was not afforded, and if they are convicted that they face the appropriate legal
[2:53:10.560 --> 2:53:18.720]  penalty. It's interesting because, as you know, Alex, Abraham Lincoln actually closed down seditious
[2:53:18.720 --> 2:53:25.120]  newspapers. I haven't recommended that yet, but there will become a time when treason has to be
[2:53:25.120 --> 2:53:29.040]  dealt with by the president. Well, I mean, let's be clear too. The South was trying to create its
[2:53:29.040 --> 2:53:33.600]  own country. It wasn't working for the Chai comms or a foreign power openly. They're openly saying
[2:53:33.600 --> 2:53:39.600]  the country shouldn't exist and they hate it and working for foreign powers. It is treasonous. It's
[2:53:39.600 --> 2:53:47.200]  not just seditious. This is a group of abject criminals, and now ABC News confirms last Friday
[2:53:47.200 --> 2:53:51.360]  the Hunter Biden laptop suddenly the New York Post isn't banned, and that's the same group.
[2:53:51.360 --> 2:53:55.280]  These seven big media outlets are going to decide who the winner is tonight. We'll talk about that
[2:53:55.280 --> 2:53:59.280]  next segment, but getting to that, what do you expect them to pull, plan A or plan B?
[2:54:00.320 --> 2:54:05.440]  Well, you know, this is a very, very close election. It's important that info warriors
[2:54:05.440 --> 2:54:12.720]  understand that polling is a snapshot in time. By the time you read any poll, the results are
[2:54:12.720 --> 2:54:18.480]  actually already obsolete. They're outdated because the electorate is that volatile and people are
[2:54:18.480 --> 2:54:25.760]  moving that quickly to new positions. If the Hunter Biden scandal, and by the way, all the
[2:54:25.760 --> 2:54:32.320]  laptop evidence has now been certified to be completely and totally accurate and genuine.
[2:54:32.320 --> 2:54:39.520]  So when NBC and Ken Delanian, who is a CIA operative working for NBC, a man fired by the
[2:54:39.520 --> 2:54:46.400]  Chicago Tribune for getting caught clearing his stories with the CIA tells you that that whole
[2:54:46.400 --> 2:54:53.840]  thing is false. That's BS. I believe the president is going to win. I hope he wins a clean victory,
[2:54:53.840 --> 2:54:57.680]  but I don't think the deep state will allow that. I think we're going to have a disputed
[2:54:57.680 --> 2:55:02.560]  result. I mean, I agree with you. They're going to pull plan A or plan B. Which one do you think it'll be?
[2:55:02.560 --> 2:55:08.320]  Well, it's too early to say. The point is the president needs to be ready, both legally ready,
[2:55:08.320 --> 2:55:15.920]  to take on, you know, Norm Eisen and Mark Elias and the other criminals. They should be arrested on
[2:55:15.920 --> 2:55:20.880]  Wednesday if there are sufficient evidence that they're involved in ballot harvesting. I believe
[2:55:20.880 --> 2:55:24.160]  that evidence exists. No, I mean, I agree. They're trying to overthrow the country.
[2:55:24.160 --> 2:55:29.040]  You can find it. And they say once they take over, they're going to put all of us in prison.
[2:55:29.040 --> 2:55:31.680]  They already tried to put you in prison. They're trying to put me in prison. I say they should
[2:55:31.680 --> 2:55:34.960]  burn in hell. We'll be right back with Roger Stone. 60 seconds.
[2:55:40.560 --> 2:55:45.440]  I get asked all the time by listeners and by the media, what am I most proud of when it comes to
[2:55:45.440 --> 2:55:50.640]  show? And it's the fact that info wars more than 25 years ago, doing basic research with what the
[2:55:50.640 --> 2:55:56.160]  club of Rome and the CFR and others were actually saying, developed the hypothesis that the communist
[2:55:56.160 --> 2:56:01.120]  China had been set up to take our jobs and transfer them to China and then make us economically
[2:56:01.120 --> 2:56:06.160]  destitute and position us into debt. Well, now China owns the debt. Now China owns Hollywood,
[2:56:06.160 --> 2:56:11.440]  all the one side of trading deals. It turns out our analysis was absolutely dead on. But again,
[2:56:11.440 --> 2:56:17.200]  it wasn't that hard. The CFR and others admitted what they were doing, but still others didn't
[2:56:17.200 --> 2:56:22.880]  want to focus on that issue. We did. And you focused on it by supporting us and info wars.
[2:56:22.880 --> 2:56:27.440]  So when you go to info wars store.com and get all the great supplements, books, t shirts, films,
[2:56:27.440 --> 2:56:31.840]  water filtration, air filtration, all of it, you're funding the organization that literally
[2:56:31.840 --> 2:56:35.760]  helped make up the world. What's really happening. So that's a big accomplishment for all of you.
[2:56:35.760 --> 2:56:52.400]  I want to thank you for your support. Before you slip into unconsciousness, I'd like to have
[2:56:52.400 --> 2:57:12.800]  another kiss. Another kiss. Another kiss. Another kiss. The crystal ship is being filled. A
[2:57:12.800 --> 2:57:17.360]  thousand girls, a thousand thrills. Here's the most important part.
[2:57:17.360 --> 2:57:42.400]  I'd rather cry, I'd rather fly. Then he goes on to say the streets are fields that never die.
[2:57:42.400 --> 2:57:50.800]  How about heroin? Which the chai comms are shipping in the crystal ship is being filled.
[2:57:51.680 --> 2:57:55.040]  But you have to ask yourself, what else is being filled? They already caught them.
[2:57:57.280 --> 2:58:00.720]  Six months ago, putting bricks all over the country, they picked one company that had
[2:58:00.720 --> 2:58:04.240]  innocently delivered bricks and said, Oh, they're innocent. But look at this. It's an article by
[2:58:04.240 --> 2:58:10.720]  Don Salazar info wars.com. We'll show you the photos stacks of bricks found in cities nationwide
[2:58:10.720 --> 2:58:16.880]  ahead of election results. And they're just delivering them everywhere, not even near construction
[2:58:16.880 --> 2:58:22.240]  sites. And they're just showing up at key areas. This is so obvious. And we got these
[2:58:22.240 --> 2:58:27.360]  anti foot documents a few years ago, where they tell them which places to attack. And then they
[2:58:27.360 --> 2:58:32.240]  send in their people to do it. It's just amazing. Roger Stone is here. One more segment with him
[2:58:32.240 --> 2:58:35.760]  than Paul Joseph Watts has taken over. Roger will be back with us throughout the night.
[2:58:35.760 --> 2:58:41.120]  Roger. So different scenarios. You're the big political the guy Trump trust. You got a good
[2:58:41.120 --> 2:58:44.560]  head on your shoulders. One of the best. Tell us what you see happening tonight.
[2:58:46.320 --> 2:58:51.760]  I think that the president is going to win. I think the momentum is with him. I think there will
[2:58:51.760 --> 2:58:58.400]  be an obvious effort by the Democrats to stall. It's very troubling to me that there are nine
[2:58:58.400 --> 2:59:03.760]  days after the election, a state like Pennsylvania in which the Democrats can manufacture and
[2:59:03.760 --> 2:59:10.880]  deliver new votes. That's going to have to be challenged again in the courts. There's no doubt
[2:59:10.880 --> 2:59:16.080]  whatsoever that the left will try to back their play with violence. Then we will see whether the
[2:59:16.080 --> 2:59:23.200]  president will use his extraordinary powers based on his oath of office to maintain order
[2:59:23.200 --> 2:59:29.280]  and protect the safety of the American people. I do not recommend violence. I do not advocate
[2:59:29.280 --> 2:59:35.920]  violence. I renounce violence. But if American citizens are attacked, they have an absolute
[2:59:35.920 --> 2:59:41.440]  right to defend themselves. Let's be very clear about that. I expect this is going to be very
[2:59:41.440 --> 2:59:49.760]  much like Bush v Gore in 2000. I expect it to go to the courts. I'm in favor of vigorous public
[2:59:49.760 --> 2:59:56.240]  peaceful demonstrations. I'm in favor of mobilization of Trump supporters and info warriors across
[2:59:56.240 --> 3:00:00.800]  the country. We need Trump caravans tonight everywhere. Everybody already gets it. We need
[3:00:00.800 --> 3:00:06.960]  boats. We need cars. We need bull horns. Everyone must mobilize now. But the American people have
[3:00:06.960 --> 3:00:13.280]  been subjected to a giant sigh. Alex, the mainstream media is in bed with the Democrats.
[3:00:13.280 --> 3:00:18.800]  Here's their storyline. The election's over. Joe Biden has won. He's leading in every state. He's
[3:00:18.800 --> 3:00:24.800]  leading nationally by 10. If you're a patriot on Tuesday, go fishing. It's over. You can't possibly
[3:00:24.800 --> 3:00:30.960]  win. You can say that this is a lie because Joe Biden cannot get 200 people to a rally.
[3:00:31.680 --> 3:00:35.680]  Never mind controlling the country. He can barely control his own bowels.
[3:00:35.680 --> 3:00:40.240]  I think this guy is around the bend. I don't think he has the mental stability. I don't think
[3:00:40.240 --> 3:00:43.920]  there's any speculation about that. I don't think there's any speculation about that.
[3:00:45.920 --> 3:00:50.400]  Well, I mean, look, speculation is based on our own eyes. We're not making this up.
[3:00:50.400 --> 3:00:54.480]  That's what I'm saying. I don't think there's any speculation. You can tell a rabid dog. You can tell a
[3:00:54.480 --> 3:01:01.360]  senile man. You can tell, you can tell, you know, pile of dog crap. I mean, Joe Biden is gone. He's
[3:01:01.360 --> 3:01:07.440]  expired. He's rotten milk. It sure looks that way to me. And that's why they have their stand
[3:01:07.440 --> 3:01:14.000]  bit by equipment. Kamala Harris, a woman who is personally responsible for the mass incarceration
[3:01:14.000 --> 3:01:18.160]  of more black people in the state of California than any living person today.
[3:01:18.160 --> 3:01:25.920]  Based on Joe Biden's law, which, as you know, required the harsh mandatory penalties for the
[3:01:25.920 --> 3:01:29.280]  first time nonviolent crime of possession of small amounts of drugs.
[3:01:29.280 --> 3:01:32.320]  I agree. We're down to the moment of truth. So let me ask you to be back tonight.
[3:01:32.320 --> 3:01:36.880]  Repeatedly, we really appreciate you doing things as they break. And then tonight with the results
[3:01:36.880 --> 3:01:42.160]  or whatever is going to happen, the live coverage at infowars.com or slash show and election night
[3:01:42.160 --> 3:01:48.000]  dot news. What does Trump do if the network, say, Fox only set number allowed to do it announces the
[3:01:48.000 --> 3:01:52.880]  winner according to big tech. And then it's clearly that Biden in the winter, I think Trump should
[3:01:52.880 --> 3:01:56.880]  go out and have a press conference and say, this is BS, we're going to block this. This is a lying
[3:01:56.880 --> 3:02:01.760]  media yet again, trying to have a coup against this country. I think he must not actly as when
[3:02:01.760 --> 3:02:08.640]  they pull this. I agree with that, Alex. Here's what some people may be forgetting. The president
[3:02:08.640 --> 3:02:12.160]  will still be president tomorrow morning, regardless of what happens in the election.
[3:02:12.160 --> 3:02:17.600]  His turn runs until January 20. He has the full power and authority of the president in the United
[3:02:17.600 --> 3:02:22.800]  States, which is an extraordinary power. Now we have to hope that those advising the president
[3:02:22.800 --> 3:02:30.800]  understand the extent and reach and magnitude of that power. The president has a number of
[3:02:30.800 --> 3:02:36.240]  totally legal options at his disposal. But the first and foremost and most important one is the
[3:02:36.240 --> 3:02:43.600]  authority and the requirement to maintain order to protect the safety of the American people.
[3:02:43.600 --> 3:02:48.560]  That's right. There's a foreign multinational coup taking place. It's a dereliction of duty. I mean,
[3:02:48.560 --> 3:02:53.040]  it's not to defend the republic. There's no question about that. And I know Donald Trump.
[3:02:53.040 --> 3:03:00.160]  I've known him for 40 years. He's a patriot. He is a man who believes deeply in American exceptionalism,
[3:03:00.160 --> 3:03:06.080]  American sovereignty and power. He finishes it. As you say, he's a counterpuncher. He's a roller and
[3:03:06.080 --> 3:03:12.800]  he's a closer. If you haven't seen anything in the last two weeks, you have seen a superhuman
[3:03:12.800 --> 3:03:20.480]  effort by Donald Trump to not only close the gap, but to pass senile Joe Biden and epically corrupt
[3:03:20.480 --> 3:03:27.840]  Kamala Harris, the red Chinese candidate. The obvious involvement of red China in this election
[3:03:27.840 --> 3:03:34.400]  is beyond dispute. The information delivered by Rudy Giuliani is not disputed. When Ben Smith
[3:03:34.400 --> 3:03:39.360]  of the New York Times writes, well, we didn't cover that because the province of those emails
[3:03:39.360 --> 3:03:50.560]  are disputed. No, Ben, you're a lying piece of. How big is it? Ben Smith is the man who published
[3:03:50.560 --> 3:03:57.680]  the completely unverified fake Steele dossier. Now he is padding the New York Times and the Wall
[3:03:57.680 --> 3:04:04.400]  Street Journal on the back for not publishing the completely verified evidence of the corruption
[3:04:04.400 --> 3:04:09.120]  of Joe and Hunter Biden. But here's the good news. Ben, we're coming for you. Ben, we're coming for
[3:04:09.120 --> 3:04:13.440]  you. We're going to expose you to the American people as the fraud that you are. You're not a
[3:04:13.440 --> 3:04:19.200]  journalist. You're a cheerleader for the Biden campaign and you're a disgrace to the human race
[3:04:19.200 --> 3:04:25.120]  and to journalists everywhere. It's ironic, Alex, because I remember when the New York Times
[3:04:25.120 --> 3:04:32.400]  was a great newspaper. It had a liberal tint. It leaned left, but it could basically be depended
[3:04:32.400 --> 3:04:38.880]  on for delivery of the news. That is no longer the case. Virtually everything being reported by
[3:04:38.880 --> 3:04:46.400]  the New York Times, CBS, NBC particularly, ABC, the Wall Street Journal. It's false, folks. It's
[3:04:46.400 --> 3:04:52.160]  distortion. It's phony. It's fabricated. It's made up. It's very important that people recognize
[3:04:52.160 --> 3:04:57.760]  that going into this election. God bless the president of the United States and my friends.
[3:04:57.760 --> 3:05:02.560]  The most important thing we can do right now, the single most important thing we can do,
[3:05:02.560 --> 3:05:10.000]  is pray. Pray to Jesus Christ, the only begotten Son of God. Pray to our almighty creator for justice,
[3:05:10.000 --> 3:05:15.840]  for an honest election and to save the republic and the United States. Never mind western
[3:05:15.840 --> 3:05:23.760]  civilization. Alex, I sit here today as living proof of the power of prayer. Jesus Christ,
[3:05:23.760 --> 3:05:29.120]  the only begotten Son of Man, and God can do anything, and they are with us because they
[3:05:29.120 --> 3:05:34.960]  smile favorably on the Democratic Republic of the United States. So please, everybody,
[3:05:34.960 --> 3:05:41.440]  pray for a just result tonight. Pray for the president and his family. Pray for our government.
[3:05:41.440 --> 3:05:46.960]  Pray for our democracy, and we'll be with you tonight to break down the election. I'm going to
[3:05:46.960 --> 3:05:52.160]  the church this afternoon to spend a little time talking to God myself because I believe
[3:05:52.160 --> 3:05:58.800]  the future of this nation is in his hands. Powerful, Roger. Very powerful, and you'll be with us
[3:05:58.800 --> 3:06:04.080]  tonight throughout the live coverage. Thank you so much, Roger Stone. Many thanks. All right. We
[3:06:04.080 --> 3:06:09.440]  are out of time. Paul Joseph Watson always is a great host, and I'm so excited he's doing his own
[3:06:09.440 --> 3:06:14.560]  thing over at Summit.News now, where he's doing great interviews and things now. We love it.
[3:06:15.200 --> 3:06:18.880]  Very exciting. He's about to host the next 45 minutes. We'll be back with us tomorrow,
[3:06:18.880 --> 3:06:22.800]  popping in as well. And we've got so much throughout tonight with live coverage as these
[3:06:22.800 --> 3:06:26.640]  numbers come in. Leigh Ann McAdoo, some of the others are here in town. Please don't forget,
[3:06:26.640 --> 3:06:31.280]  DNA Force Plus, amazing for yourselves, your mitochondria, your telomeres. It's back in stock,
[3:06:31.280 --> 3:06:36.640]  the BQQ, the Goku 10, free shipping, 50% off. Triple Petri points. It's our new special along
[3:06:36.640 --> 3:06:41.840]  with turmeric, ultimate formula bodies back inside. Okay, my fellow patriots, we are two days away
[3:06:41.840 --> 3:06:46.480]  from the election and the big talking point by the young turds, all the communists, all the socialists,
[3:06:47.040 --> 3:06:52.800]  AOCs, people in the Democratic Party, and media matters in George Soros is that we want violence
[3:06:52.800 --> 3:06:57.760]  and that we offensively want to go out and kill them or attack them. That's the last thing I ever
[3:06:57.760 --> 3:07:05.280]  want that would turn these dirty anti-American, anti-goddy, anti-family, anti-cop, anti-constitution,
[3:07:05.280 --> 3:07:12.800]  anti-global rights, anti-common sense people into martyrs. No offensive violence. No killing or
[3:07:12.800 --> 3:07:17.920]  shooting anybody that isn't trying to kill or shooting you. I have no desire for this. We have
[3:07:17.920 --> 3:07:22.080]  been talking about the Democrats calling for civil war, calling for an overrun in the White House,
[3:07:22.080 --> 3:07:26.000]  calling for killing Trump, calling for killing cops. It's all over the news. You see the violent
[3:07:26.000 --> 3:07:30.560]  attacks and we're simply saying that if they kill Trump or have a fraudulent election and throw him
[3:07:30.560 --> 3:07:36.720]  out of office and come after us, people have to be ready to defend themselves. Defense, not offense.
[3:07:36.720 --> 3:07:42.480]  Look out for false flags. The controlled corporate media are mouthpieces for any big corporation
[3:07:42.480 --> 3:07:47.600]  or government that will pay them. It's that simple. They use our open free society against us.
[3:07:48.240 --> 3:07:52.240]  The controlled media will talk about a few mistakes I've made over the years and obsess over it. They
[3:07:52.240 --> 3:07:58.000]  see he's a liar on purpose even though our success rate, our accuracy rate is way, way better than
[3:07:58.000 --> 3:08:03.680]  theirs. We try to tell the truth. They try to lie. They try to deceive. I'm trying to get people
[3:08:03.680 --> 3:08:06.880]  to realize that the globalists operate and how they manipulate, how they
[3:08:08.160 --> 3:08:12.800]  bamboozle the public. I'm trying to get the public to ask questions and do not believe what
[3:08:12.800 --> 3:08:19.520]  they're told in the face. I'm trying to get people to research for themselves. The globalists
[3:08:19.520 --> 3:08:24.400]  of their controlled corporate press say that researching and not trusting media is evil and
[3:08:24.400 --> 3:08:30.480]  is a conspiracy theory. But again, on its face, that is a fraud. Question everything. Question
[3:08:30.480 --> 3:08:34.720]  info wars. Add your own research to it and then decide what you're going to promote to others
[3:08:34.720 --> 3:09:01.680]  and what new sources are accurate. I believe it was the best source out there. You're listening to the Alex Jones show. Transmitting worldwide from the summit.new studios in the United Kingdom. You're listening to Paul Joseph Watson.
[3:09:01.680 --> 3:09:30.960]  And we are live on the day of the U.S. presidential election 2020. For the past few weeks, even few months, we've had this mainstream media narrative that the people engaging in voter intimidation, the people planning to engage in voter intimidation and poll watcher intimidation will be President Trump supporters, the proud boys, the boogaloo boys, this mythical entity that Belle even exists.
[3:09:31.680 --> 3:09:58.320]  And of course, the shadowy militias that we've been warned about over the past few weeks and months that apparently roll set to turn up a polling stations and intimidate Democrats. And yet already there's a few hours or so into voting. What do we see happening? Who is doing the voter intimidation? Who is doing the poll watcher intimidation? It's not the proud boys. It's not the boogaloo boys. It's not the shadowy militias. It's Democrats.
[3:09:58.320 --> 3:10:12.840]  Well, imagine my shock headline. Daily caller. Philadelphia city commissioners say they are investigating after video reportedly shows GOP poll watcher getting kicked out of polling place. This happened just a few hours ago.
[3:10:12.840 --> 3:10:33.400]  Philadelphia city commissioners said they are investigating after a Wednesday video reportedly showed GOP poll watcher being kicked out of a Philadelphia polling place. And there's video of this, disposed of by human events editor Will Chamberlain showed Gary Feldman, the GOP poll watcher asking two poll workers. So you're not letting me in one of the workers replied. No.
[3:10:33.400 --> 3:11:01.400]  Call the police. Do it. The mail poll worker told Feldman. If you're legal, call the cops. So Feldman, this GOP poll watcher had a citywide watchers certificate that gave him legal right to have access to the polling station to monitor the voting count, but the female poll worker told him that it's not for this location, despite the fact that the certificate allowed him to poll watch at any location in Philadelphia.
[3:11:01.400 --> 3:11:19.400]  Feldman's watchers certificate, which is disposed by Chamberlain, a copy of which was was seen by the daily caller, stated that the quote certificate authorizes the individual to watch in any ward division in Philadelphia. So he had the exact permit. He had the right papers.
[3:11:19.400 --> 3:11:41.400]  He had the right to be there. They told him to leave immediately. Apparently, he did eventually get in there after an investigation by local authorities. But what I found interesting about this, and we're going to see this throughout the night, is this fact checking machine that's been launched by Twitter by mainstream media.
[3:11:41.400 --> 3:12:00.400]  And in particular by Buzzfeed, and a woman fact checker, an official Buzzfeed fact checker called Jane Litvinenko. Now what's interesting about Ms Litvinenko is that she once fact checked me back in 2019 after the Notre Dame fire.
[3:12:00.400 --> 3:12:22.400]  Now, of course, you remember the Notre Dame fire. It was awesome. That's conclusively been proven, of course. But the fact is that after the Notre Dame fire in France in 2019, Facebook pages, notably France 24, France News Arabic, showed Muslims hundreds and thousands of them celebrating the fire at the Notre Dame Cathedral.
[3:12:22.400 --> 3:12:44.400]  Now, Ms Jane Litvinenko, the big Buzzfeed fact checker, then wrote a massive hit piece on me claiming that there was no evidence Muslims were celebrating the Notre Dame fire, because these responses, these happy, smiley, emoticon faces and gleeful comments in response to the fire were not clearly in response to any actual event.
[3:12:44.400 --> 3:12:56.400]  The problem with that was the video of the Notre Dame Cathedral was literally on fire in the video that these people with Muslim names were responding to. She never withdrew that.
[3:12:56.400 --> 3:13:10.400]  She did have to withdraw this fact check, because initially Litvinenko, again this Buzzfeed fact checker claimed that the GOP poll watcher had no right to be inside that building watching the poll.
[3:13:10.400 --> 3:13:22.400]  She since had to reverse that once it was investigated by local authorities, and it turned out the poll watcher did indeed have the right to be in there at that location and indeed any location in Philly.
[3:13:22.400 --> 3:13:29.400]  So she had to basically go into full reversal mode and fact check her own fact check.
[3:13:29.400 --> 3:13:35.400]  And so I've deleted a tweet in this thread after misinterpreting PA law. I apologize for my error.
[3:13:35.400 --> 3:13:48.400]  And she goes on to admit the situation shown in this video did happen. So you're going to get these fact checkers who, by the way, are now going to pronounce the victor of the presidential election or prevent Donald Trump from doing so, from giving a victory speech.
[3:13:48.400 --> 3:13:50.400]  We're going to get on to that shortly.
[3:13:50.400 --> 3:13:55.400]  Fact checking things that turn out to be wrong and then having to fact check themselves.
[3:13:55.400 --> 3:14:06.400]  So we already have massive evidence throughout Pennsylvania specifically from what I've seen of voter intimidation and indeed breaking the law.
[3:14:06.400 --> 3:14:09.400]  Here's another headline from Information Liberation.
[3:14:09.400 --> 3:14:15.400]  Dems caught cheating in Philly handing out dem voting guides inside polling site.
[3:14:15.400 --> 3:14:32.400]  Within minutes of polls opening in the crucial swing state of Pennsylvania, Democrats were reportedly caught illegally electioneering handing out Democrat voting guides to voters who were in line to vote blocking GOP poll watches in the notoriously corrupt city of Philadelphia.
[3:14:32.400 --> 3:14:40.400]  First they were busted illegally electioneering with giant signs telling people to vote for Democrats on a polling place in Northeast Philly.
[3:14:40.400 --> 3:14:51.400]  Of course, this photo circulated a few hours ago. A giant billboard basically stuck up outside the polling place with Biden Harris on it, no mention of Trump whatsoever.
[3:14:51.400 --> 3:14:54.400]  There were multiple smaller illegal signs.
[3:14:54.400 --> 3:15:05.400]  There's another tweet here where it was revealed that GOP poll watchers were walled off from the vote counting tables at a vote counting site with no way to actually observe.
[3:15:05.400 --> 3:15:13.400]  So in Philadelphia and throughout Pennsylvania, it looks like some shady stuff is starting to go down.
[3:15:13.400 --> 3:15:21.400]  Now the positive so far for Trump is that it appears he's doing quite well in Florida.
[3:15:21.400 --> 3:15:31.400]  In fact, we have the latest update here from political polls, which shows that Republicans in terms of people who voted and are registered as Republican.
[3:15:31.400 --> 3:15:35.400]  Does it mean they voted for Trump? But it's a pretty good indication.
[3:15:35.400 --> 3:15:40.400]  Currently up by 157,000 votes in Florida.
[3:15:40.400 --> 3:15:48.400]  So we have Republicans voting at a rate of 4 million 41,000 compared to Democrats 3,884,000.
[3:15:48.400 --> 3:15:52.400]  Then you have non-party affiliated at 2.4 million.
[3:15:52.400 --> 3:16:01.400]  So currently, and these numbers continue to shoot up hour by hour, Republicans appear to be out voting Democrats in Florida.
[3:16:01.400 --> 3:16:11.400]  Now, of course, people shooting back on Twitter, the blue wave advocates say, well, 15% of those registered Republicans are going to be voting for Biden.
[3:16:11.400 --> 3:16:15.400]  Again, they're citing the same dodgy polls that have proven inconsistent time and time again.
[3:16:15.400 --> 3:16:24.400]  And of course, they claim they wish they hope that those non-party affiliated voters are going to break majority for Biden.
[3:16:24.400 --> 3:16:36.400]  So people are predicting that by the end of this registered Republican vote is going to have to be up by 300,000 to 400,000 in Florida for Trump to take Florida.
[3:16:36.400 --> 3:16:47.400]  But at the rate it's going, currently latest indication show 150,000 ahead in terms of registered Republicans voting, it's looking like Trump could pull it off in Florida.
[3:16:47.400 --> 3:16:52.400]  And then, of course, we have the other factor which has been noted time and time again.
[3:16:52.400 --> 3:17:01.400]  Some surveys show that 25% of people attending Trump rallies were registered Democrats.
[3:17:01.400 --> 3:17:13.400]  So by no means 100% of registered Democrats voting in Florida and indeed other areas by no means 100% of them are going to be voting for Joe Biden.
[3:17:13.400 --> 3:17:19.400]  So early indication show a lot of shady happenings occurring in Pennsylvania.
[3:17:19.400 --> 3:17:25.400]  But according to early figures, there's a massive turnout across the board and specifically amongst Republicans in Florida.
[3:17:25.400 --> 3:17:35.400]  And it looks like Donald Trump could be performing very well in the sunshine state as we go into the mid stage of the voting day.
[3:17:35.400 --> 3:17:38.400]  Of course, results coming up later. We'll be back now, go away.
[3:17:38.400 --> 3:17:50.400]  It's taken me two and a half years to finally even be able to convince Congress and the rest of the world that we were only the initial target to set the precedent for coordinated big tech censorship.
[3:17:50.400 --> 3:17:57.400]  Now the world finally understands it, but we don't have two and a half years for the learning curve to take place this time.
[3:17:57.400 --> 3:18:05.400]  Bill Gates and the UN are on record saying the lockdown is permanent. It is a plan to lower carbon footprint.
[3:18:05.400 --> 3:18:08.400]  It is a plan to make the world population poor.
[3:18:08.400 --> 3:18:13.400]  It is a diabolical power grab. It is a revolution against the industrial revolution.
[3:18:13.400 --> 3:18:21.400]  They call it the post industrial world. And it's the excuse for them to take control every fast of our lives and implement absolute authoritarianism.
[3:18:21.400 --> 3:18:31.400]  So again, everybody out there, if you love your children, my daughter that just woke up here, and if you care about yourselves in any future, you need to get away, you need to understand this information.
[3:18:31.400 --> 3:18:38.400]  You've worn others. Okay. It's a life and death situation.
[3:18:38.400 --> 3:18:46.400]  Infowars has been reporting on the dark, unpleasant truths of big government corruption for over two decades.
[3:18:46.400 --> 3:18:53.400]  It is why they attack us and it is why we are now the most banned broadcast in the world.
[3:18:53.400 --> 3:18:58.400]  The Hunter Biden hard drive scandal is merely the tip of the iceberg.
[3:18:58.400 --> 3:19:06.400]  Evil has infested governments everywhere, but the evil establishment is censoring content across all media platforms.
[3:19:06.400 --> 3:19:10.400]  They blocked you from sharing banned video on social media.
[3:19:10.400 --> 3:19:18.400]  So go to election night dot news and share it like your lives depended on it.
[3:19:18.400 --> 3:19:26.400]  Go to election night dot news to find the truth about COVID vaccines, Bill Gates and big pharma.
[3:19:26.400 --> 3:19:34.400]  Go to election night dot news to find all the information the crooked establishment is most afraid of.
[3:19:34.400 --> 3:19:39.400]  Go to election night dot news and share now.
[3:19:39.400 --> 3:19:44.400]  There are many references in the Holy Bible to the mustard seed and why is that?
[3:19:44.400 --> 3:19:52.400]  It's one of the tiniest seeds out there, but a giant tree like bush grows from it that produces more mustard seeds.
[3:19:52.400 --> 3:19:57.400]  Mustard was known by the ancients around the world to have amazing health effects.
[3:19:57.400 --> 3:20:04.400]  They didn't know why. Well, with modern science, we know it's one of the purest, cleanest, organic forms of selenium.
[3:20:04.400 --> 3:20:16.400]  We have bio-true selenium sold out for months back in stock at infowarsstore.com at 50% off, store ride free shipping, and triple Patriot points.
[3:20:16.400 --> 3:20:25.400]  Bio-true selenium at infowarsstore.com is an amazing product and it's even more amazing in that it funds our operation.
[3:20:25.400 --> 3:20:32.400]  But if you don't know about selenium, research it. It is an essential nutrient in the body that you actually have to have.
[3:20:32.400 --> 3:20:56.400]  It's back in stock, 50% off, triple Patriot points at infowarsstore.com and with free shipping.
[3:21:02.400 --> 3:21:05.400]  It all started eight, nine months ago, I told you, it's never going to end.
[3:21:05.400 --> 3:21:13.400]  They're never going to turn loose this power. They're going to make you have internal passports on your phones to leave your house to have a job to travel.
[3:21:13.400 --> 3:21:18.400]  They're going to add more and more restrictions on how you get that travel pass.
[3:21:18.400 --> 3:21:24.400]  Remember the Running Man, Schwarzenegger movie, the mid-80s, written by Stephen King about a future police state?
[3:21:24.400 --> 3:21:27.400]  Watch that movie and then compare it to today.
[3:21:27.400 --> 3:21:35.400]  We are in the absolute brand, the absolute mold of a classic authoritarian dystopic nightmare.
[3:21:35.400 --> 3:22:00.400]  We've got to reject this now before it's submitted.
[3:22:00.400 --> 3:22:10.400]  Now, of course, a couple of the better indications as to how presidential elections are going to go are the betting market and the stock market.
[3:22:10.400 --> 3:22:15.400]  Of course, the actual political polls were proven spectacularly wrong back in 2016.
[3:22:15.400 --> 3:22:19.400]  The gambling markets weren't, the financial markets weren't.
[3:22:19.400 --> 3:22:22.400]  Of course, you had a downturn going into the 2016 election.
[3:22:22.400 --> 3:22:26.400]  Now you had an upturn over the past few months in the S&P and the Dow Jones.
[3:22:26.400 --> 3:22:39.400]  That almost always indicates, I think, to an 86% certainty that the incumbent party is going to win if you have a good economy into the stock market in the last three months of campaigning.
[3:22:39.400 --> 3:22:43.400]  Of course, the Dow Jones last time I checked was up today.
[3:22:43.400 --> 3:22:48.400]  Then you have the betting market, and this brings me to this headline from summit.news.
[3:22:48.400 --> 3:22:52.400]  Dow Jones currently up, as you can see right there.
[3:22:52.400 --> 3:22:58.400]  British gambler stakes $5 million on Trump in largest ever political bet.
[3:22:58.400 --> 3:23:05.400]  We've seen over the past 24 hours a big rush in terms of wages placed on President Trump.
[3:23:05.400 --> 3:23:10.400]  Obviously, that's partly because people are going to get way bigger paybacks if indeed Trump gets reelected.
[3:23:10.400 --> 3:23:19.400]  But now a British gambler has staked $5 million on President Trump winning reelection and what is believed to be the largest ever political bet.
[3:23:19.400 --> 3:23:28.400]  This is a former banker who used private bookmakers registered on the Caribbean island of Caracow and was able to secure odds of 37 to 20,
[3:23:28.400 --> 3:23:33.400]  meaning he will cash into the tune of $15 million if Trump is victorious.
[3:23:33.400 --> 3:23:40.400]  Apparently, he placed the bet after having a private consultation with Trump camp insiders.
[3:23:40.400 --> 3:23:45.400]  But then again, I don't think he's going to meet with them and they're going to tell him that Trump's going to lose, are they?
[3:23:45.400 --> 3:23:52.400]  But according to one industry source, quote, word of this bet has done the rounds and we think it's the biggest ever made on politics.
[3:23:52.400 --> 3:24:02.400]  According to gambling comparison site, odds checker 71% of money wagered on the outcome of the election was in favor of Trump over the first four hours of this morning.
[3:24:02.400 --> 3:24:09.400]  And according to the head of marketing at odds checker Sam Eaton, that represents a remarkable swing.
[3:24:09.400 --> 3:24:15.400]  He said the 2020 election is following a very similar betting pattern to the one we witnessed back in 2016.
[3:24:15.400 --> 3:24:20.400]  The closer we got to election day, the more money came in for Donald J. Trump.
[3:24:20.400 --> 3:24:30.400]  However, according to Paddy Power, the numbers are even bigger with 93% of bets being placed on a Trump victory over the last 24 hours.
[3:24:30.400 --> 3:24:42.400]  Some things seems to have shifted, not just with people anticipating bigger payouts, but with some of the poll numbers over the past 24 hours, which I'm going to get into here in a second.
[3:24:42.400 --> 3:24:50.400]  Ladbrooks, Jessica O'Reilly said, even at the 11th hour, punters are continuing to back Trump at the odds on offer.
[3:24:50.400 --> 3:24:58.400]  Then we have this headline. Top gambling site shows Americans in 49 out 50 states betting on Trump victory.
[3:24:58.400 --> 3:25:01.400]  This is the world's largest fantasy sports gambling website.
[3:25:01.400 --> 3:25:08.400]  It's tweeted on Monday, a map of America showing the vast majority of those betting on the election think President Trump will be reelected.
[3:25:08.400 --> 3:25:13.400]  Draft Kings wrote D key election pool alert with over 350,000 entries.
[3:25:13.400 --> 3:25:20.400]  A majority of people in every state besides Colorado predict Donald Trump will be the winner of tomorrow's election.
[3:25:20.400 --> 3:25:30.400]  So all the betting money over the past 24 48 hours is flooding onto Trump and this partly could explain why.
[3:25:30.400 --> 3:25:37.400]  Headline out of the independent says Joe Biden's lead vanishes in four swing states according to poll aggregator.
[3:25:37.400 --> 3:25:41.400]  Joe Biden's lead has evaporated in four key swing states.
[3:25:41.400 --> 3:25:46.400]  This is according to the real clear politics average, Iowa, Georgia, North Carolina and Ohio.
[3:25:46.400 --> 3:25:57.400]  Trump has seized the lead, although several polling experts said that the results were not credible because again, they come from the one polling firm that actually got it right in 2016,
[3:25:57.400 --> 3:26:04.400]  which actually fairly tallies the vote in terms of registered Democrats and Republicans.
[3:26:04.400 --> 3:26:13.400]  Of course, we know with all the mainstream DNC controlled polling agencies, they routinely poll 10% plus Democrats over Republicans.
[3:26:13.400 --> 3:26:25.400]  But it says real clear politics still gave Mr. Biden a 72 point percent lead nationally with a 0.09% lead in Arizona and Florida and 1.2% lead in Pennsylvania.
[3:26:25.400 --> 3:26:32.400]  The biggest collapse of support for the 77 year old was in Iowa, whereas recently as Friday, he was ahead by 1.2%.
[3:26:32.400 --> 3:26:47.400]  And now Trump leads Iowa by 2% of the vote, Georgia by 1%, North Carolina by 0.2%, and Ohio by 1.4%, whereas Biden was previously leading in all four states.
[3:26:47.400 --> 3:26:50.400]  But in recent days, his lead has dwindled.
[3:26:50.400 --> 3:27:01.400]  Now, again, they're trying to discredit this because it's from the Trafalgar group, which actually does polling fairly in comparison to the DNC controlled polling firms.
[3:27:01.400 --> 3:27:10.400]  But they wait for what they call social desirability, which takes into account the idea that some Trump voters are afraid to be honest with pollsters.
[3:27:10.400 --> 3:27:23.400]  And this is a key factor that we saw in 2016, that we saw again with the Brexit vote also in 2016, where people, because they're afraid of their choice, their decision getting released publicly,
[3:27:23.400 --> 3:27:36.400]  they're afraid of getting doxed as many mainstream journalists now think it's their job to dox Trump voters, that they'll tell the pollsters one thing while secretly preparing to vote in the opposite way.
[3:27:36.400 --> 3:27:46.400]  Now, this is key because when they do polls asking how people are going to vote, that's what produces the Biden plus seven, Biden plus eight, Biden plus 10.
[3:27:46.400 --> 3:27:57.400]  But when they ask who people think their neighbors are going to vote for routinely in those surveys, Trump comes out ahead of Biden by 10 points or more.
[3:27:57.400 --> 3:28:05.400]  So again, we have this phenomenon of the shy Trump voter who is afraid to tell pollsters of how he's going to vote for Trump.
[3:28:05.400 --> 3:28:09.400]  And he tells them the opposite. And then he goes out and he votes for Trump.
[3:28:09.400 --> 3:28:19.400]  How much of a factor will that have in the final vote call it tally, especially with all these mail-in ballots yet to be counted remains to be seen.
[3:28:19.400 --> 3:28:29.400]  But that could explain some of why the betting money, the onrushed wages has predominantly gone to Donald Trump over the past 24 hours.
[3:28:29.400 --> 3:28:39.400]  Now, of course, it remains to be seen if Donald Trump will even be allowed to declare himself the winner, even if he wins in a massive landslide, which again is somewhat unlikely.
[3:28:39.400 --> 3:28:53.400]  But you know, we have to remember Hawkfish, we had the story a couple of months ago, this pro Biden polling firm came out and started preparing the groundwork for the potential of this what they're now calling the red mirage.
[3:28:53.400 --> 3:29:01.400]  Trump winning clearly on election night and then coming back and saying, oh, no, we have to count the mail-in ballots and that's going to take days.
[3:29:01.400 --> 3:29:08.400]  Maybe it's going to take weeks. Maybe it's going to take just as long as it takes to get Biden over the edge.
[3:29:08.400 --> 3:29:17.400]  Then we have the effect, of course, as I mentioned before, of the networks, the news networks, not allowing Donald Trump to proclaim victory.
[3:29:17.400 --> 3:29:26.400]  Someone said this publicly. Headline out of zero hedge. Scarborough, we will not air any Trump victory speech Tuesday night.
[3:29:26.400 --> 3:29:33.400]  As there was an interesting moment on Mondays, the hosting guests on MSNBC's Morning Joe were discussing the coverage of the election.
[3:29:33.400 --> 3:29:40.400]  Willie Geist raised the possibility that President Trump could declare victory on election night before all the votes have been counted.
[3:29:40.400 --> 3:29:48.400]  Joe Scarborough responded that NBC would simply make a Twitter-like determination and not carry the speech.
[3:29:48.400 --> 3:29:54.400]  They're just going to pretend it never happened while they fact-check everything.
[3:29:54.400 --> 3:29:59.400]  And as we've already seen, they're tripping themselves up in that regard already.
[3:29:59.400 --> 3:30:07.400]  He said it would not be treated as obvious news, but rather disinformation regardless of what has transpired on election day.
[3:30:07.400 --> 3:30:15.400]  Again, we have the Biden campaign coming out and saying, under no scenario will Trump be allowed to declare victory.
[3:30:15.400 --> 3:30:22.400]  That's a headline we had up yesterday. Then we have the networks themselves agreeing with that and saying they won't carry the speech.
[3:30:22.400 --> 3:30:33.400]  Literally dictating reality by refusing to broadcast it, even if indications are that Trump is a significant number of electoral votes ahead.
[3:30:33.400 --> 3:30:39.400]  Again, we had the headline yesterday, Biden campaign manager under no scenario will Trump be allowed to declare victory.
[3:30:39.400 --> 3:30:44.400]  They've come out and said they're not going to accept, they're not going to concede defeat.
[3:30:44.400 --> 3:30:50.400]  We also have the Biden campaign coming out and saying that he's going to quote,
[3:30:50.400 --> 3:31:06.400]  assert control as president-elect if declared winner by news organization. So the same news organizations that say we're not even going to broadcast or carry Trump's victory speech are going to declare Biden winner according to the Biden campaign.
[3:31:06.400 --> 3:31:10.400]  This is what they're planning. He's going to come out and quote, assert control.
[3:31:10.400 --> 3:31:20.400]  He's going to start making cabinet appointments within an hour or two after he's up there claiming that he's now the president-elect.
[3:31:20.400 --> 3:31:30.400]  And of course, you know that basically every news organization, apart from Fox News or maybe even Fox News, given what's happened with them recently, is going to have Biden's back.
[3:31:30.400 --> 3:31:37.400]  So Trump really needs to be ahead by a long way for this scenario not to happen. Don't go away. Summit.News will be right back.
[3:31:37.400 --> 3:31:44.400]  We're only here on air facing the globalist onslaught, the DNC funded lawsuits and everything that's happening because of you.
[3:31:44.400 --> 3:31:51.400]  We built the only truly multimedia independent radio TV, print, film organization in the world that promotes the truth against the globalist.
[3:31:51.400 --> 3:31:56.400]  We've had a devastating effect. We're a national treasure. You're a national treasure for supporting us.
[3:31:56.400 --> 3:32:04.400]  And so go get a t-shirt. Go get a historic t-shirt. We've got a funny one that's the Biden groping a woman. It's a woman's design shirt.
[3:32:04.400 --> 3:32:07.400]  My wife really likes it. She sent me this gift. It's pretty cute. Here it is.
[3:32:07.400 --> 3:32:13.400]  And it just, you know, it's a little historic thing. I think Trump's gonna win, but if Biden's able to steal it, we'll be probably shut down pretty quick.
[3:32:13.400 --> 3:32:24.400]  So it'll be historic thing to have. You'll only be able to fight them in the third dimension on the street with graffiti, with handbills you hand out and with non-compliance, not paying taxes and pulling your kids out of the schools
[3:32:24.400 --> 3:32:31.400]  and just making it a full-time job to expose and fight and obstruct the criminal foreign takeover of America. We've gotten to that point.
[3:32:31.400 --> 3:32:38.400]  Biden's for nursing home. I hope to retire Biden. That'd be a collector's item. Get it while you still can. We're not ordering more. Infowarsstore.com
[3:32:38.400 --> 3:32:52.400]  It's all on record. Yale, Harvard, Princeton, Stanford, they were all hired a year ago and then again six months ago to war game how to get the public to stay locked down during a pandemic
[3:32:52.400 --> 3:33:02.400]  and how to get the public to take inoculations. And they talk about calling people heroes that do it. They talk about shaming those that don't. This has all been psychologically tested.
[3:33:02.400 --> 3:33:10.400]  It's all been psychologically prepared. And once they get you to lock down for 15 days, you notice now they say it's permanent. That's how it works.
[3:33:10.400 --> 3:33:17.400]  Oh, just put these handcuffs on. The serial killer says the woman in the parking lot and everything will be all right. No.
[3:33:17.400 --> 3:33:27.400]  Now, we've already put the handcuffs on and we're in the serial killer's van. He's taking us to his shack in the woods to slowly torture us to death. That's the allegory.
[3:33:27.400 --> 3:33:32.400]  We got to bust out of this thing now. We got to say no now. We got to make a run for it now and we still can.
[3:33:32.400 --> 3:33:38.400]  Once he gets us in that basement, it's going to get a lot, lot worse, folks. So stop submitting.
[3:33:38.400 --> 3:33:49.400]  Two M4s best selling products are now back in stock for big sold out for months. Biotree Selenium from the mustard seed, a central in all electrochemical activity of the cells in the body.
[3:33:49.400 --> 3:33:57.400]  That's every human activity. And on top of it, body's ultimate turmeric formula with 95 percent humanoid.
[3:33:57.400 --> 3:34:05.400]  Lady competitors have 3 to 5 percent. The things that turmeric does, I don't have to tell you, this is the highest quality, the strongest you're going to find.
[3:34:05.400 --> 3:34:10.400]  So both of these are amazing products and they fund the InfoWare, which is a 360 win.
[3:34:10.400 --> 3:34:21.400]  On top of it, despite the fact that they're in demand, they've been sold out for months, they're both 50 percent off, triple Patriot points and free shipping at InfoWareStore.com.
[3:34:21.400 --> 3:34:31.400]  That's bio, true Selenium from the mustard seed. It's amazing. And on top of it, we also have body's ultimate turmeric formula at InfoWareStore.com.
[3:34:31.400 --> 3:34:57.400]  Now it's easier than ever to have Band.video on your iPhone. Simply go to Band.video with your Safari browser.
[3:34:57.400 --> 3:35:04.400]  Then you click the share button at the bottom of the screen. When the menu comes up, you simply click add to home screen.
[3:35:04.400 --> 3:35:14.400]  It will then ask you to name the app. I suggest Band.video. You will now have Band.video app on your home screen, despite the fact that Tim Cook tried to stop it.
[3:35:14.400 --> 3:35:22.400]  The globalists think you're lazy, but by taking a little bit of action, you can override them, have the app, and then tell others about it so they can get the app.
[3:35:22.400 --> 3:35:29.400]  So it's up to you whether you want to defy big tech and click the share buttons below on your email, on Facebook, on Twitter, on YouTube.
[3:35:29.400 --> 3:35:53.400]  However you want, be sure and share Band.video.
[3:35:53.400 --> 3:36:02.400]  Live from London, England, it's Paul Joseph Watson with Summit.News.
[3:36:02.400 --> 3:36:15.400]  Of course we know that one of the big elephants in the room basically in 2020 that we didn't really have in 2016 is big tech manipulation as Professor Epstein has documented on many occasions.
[3:36:15.400 --> 3:36:27.400]  Big tech can shift millions, millions of votes on election day by relegating content in their algorithm by, in the case of Google, placing certain search results above others.
[3:36:27.400 --> 3:36:35.400]  They've run massive tests on this, including the biggest election in the world in India, proven that it can shift millions of votes.
[3:36:35.400 --> 3:36:47.400]  We now see evidence of that happening again today, big surprise given that of course the Google executives were literally crying in the corridors back in 2016 and vowing to never let this happen again.
[3:36:47.400 --> 3:36:50.400]  Similar situation with Twitter and Facebook.
[3:36:50.400 --> 3:37:02.400]  Gateway Pundit reports, in 2016 Gateway Pundit was one of the top four pro-trump websites on Facebook, so today Facebook shut down our traffic to a trickle on election day.
[3:37:02.400 --> 3:37:11.400]  Another example of big tech manipulation, they say that in 2016 Facebook traffic was around one third of our traffic at the Gateway Pundit.
[3:37:11.400 --> 3:37:15.400]  I'm sure this is similar for other conservative websites.
[3:37:15.400 --> 3:37:27.400]  So today Facebook is about 1% of our traffic, so they've literally lost about 32% of their traffic, Facebook burying them in the algorithm on election day.
[3:37:27.400 --> 3:37:40.400]  Another clear example of election manipulation, and we're going to see that throughout the day with Twitter, fact checking, deleting, hiding tweets of specifically voter intimidation as we've seen already.
[3:37:40.400 --> 3:37:48.400]  Meanwhile, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff tells TV news anchors military won't intervene in election.
[3:37:48.400 --> 3:38:01.400]  As much as the left has been planning, organizing and calling for the military to become involved in presiding over the peaceful transfer of power if Trump refuses to leave the White House as they're all panicking about.
[3:38:01.400 --> 3:38:17.400]  Well now the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff held an off the record meeting, this was on Saturday, with TV anchors from CNN, ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox News, in which he asserted the US military will not intervene in the aftermath of the presidential election.
[3:38:17.400 --> 3:38:28.400]  Remember, we've got these left-wing anarchist antifa groups openly planning on social media without getting banned to storm DC, to drag Trump out of the White House.
[3:38:28.400 --> 3:38:44.400]  But now the military itself is saying that its role is apolitical, and Mark Milley also sought to dispel any notion of a role for the military in adjudicating a disputed election or making any decision around removing a president from the White House.
[3:38:44.400 --> 3:38:50.400]  They had a bunch of news network anchors who were involved in this call, so they vowed not to do that.
[3:38:50.400 --> 3:38:58.400]  But despite that, we have troops arriving in major cities in America ahead of election night, again this is up on Summit.News.
[3:38:58.400 --> 3:39:01.400]  National Guard troops have been called into action.
[3:39:01.400 --> 3:39:03.400]  Not that most of them weren't already there.
[3:39:03.400 --> 3:39:16.400]  Anyway, thanks to peaceful BLM demonstrations, they've been called into action in several US cities ahead of the election with the expectation that leftists will engage in widespread civil unrest if early indications of a Trump victory emerge.
[3:39:16.400 --> 3:39:25.400]  They're not boarding up the stores in Washington DC, in New York City, in all these other areas, because they think Trump supporters are going to riot.
[3:39:25.400 --> 3:39:35.400]  They're boarding them up purely because of the riots that have taken place over the past five months, exclusively launched by BLM and Antifa.
[3:39:35.400 --> 3:39:43.400]  Despite the fact that Michelle Obama literally got up and said that the best majority of the riot of the protests had been peaceful.
[3:39:43.400 --> 3:39:46.400]  The best majority of riots did not involve Black Lives Matter.
[3:39:46.400 --> 3:39:49.400]  Literally 95% of them did.
[3:39:49.400 --> 3:39:52.400]  Now we have troops arriving to deal with any potential fallout.
[3:39:52.400 --> 3:40:03.400]  Meanwhile, the final poll that Yahoo News conducted found that 77% of Americans think violence will break out after the election.
[3:40:03.400 --> 3:40:11.400]  51% of voters think Trump will refuse to concede, while 77% worry that violence will break out in the coming days.
[3:40:11.400 --> 3:40:18.400]  And then when you look at what people will believe, depending on who won, very similar situation.
[3:40:18.400 --> 3:40:31.400]  It found that 59% of Trump supporters believe that if Trump loses, it will be because Democrats rigged the election, while 58% of Biden supporters believe that if the former VP loses, it will be because Republicans stole the election.
[3:40:31.400 --> 3:40:42.400]  So neither of them are going to accept the result of the election, and that only leads to one thing, massive civil dislocation and violent unrest.
[3:40:42.400 --> 3:40:45.400]  Can't wait for more of that, like we haven't had enough of it.
[3:40:45.400 --> 3:40:53.400]  Meanwhile, the most common female name for a Biden voter is, wait for it, Karen.
[3:40:53.400 --> 3:41:00.400]  Now, of course, this is interesting because the left tried to hijack the whole Karen meme over the past six to eight months.
[3:41:00.400 --> 3:41:08.400]  They tried to hijack the trope and turn it into a stereotype of a typical female Trump supporter.
[3:41:08.400 --> 3:41:17.400]  They tried to make it out as if the typical Karen is somebody who bursts into a Walmart without a mask and then gets into an argument with the staff.
[3:41:17.400 --> 3:41:25.400]  They tried to make it out as if, you know, the Karen meme was this typical right-wing gun-toting Republican.
[3:41:25.400 --> 3:41:35.400]  Turns out the typical Karen is a left-wing Democrat, as I've been saying all along, and it's admitted in a New York Times study.
[3:41:35.400 --> 3:41:41.400]  The figures show that Karen's are more likely to vote for Biden over Trump by a 60 to 40 margin.
[3:41:41.400 --> 3:41:44.400]  The most common female name for a Trump voter is Nancy.
[3:41:44.400 --> 3:41:53.400]  Well, the most common male name is Richard, but the most common female name for a Biden supporter is, I'm afraid, Karen.
[3:41:53.400 --> 3:42:01.400]  So that, once again, completely eviscerates this trope that a Karen is a angry female Trump supporter.
[3:42:01.400 --> 3:42:05.400]  Turns out it's actually a Biden supporter.
[3:42:05.400 --> 3:42:07.400]  Moving on to coronavirus lockdown news.
[3:42:07.400 --> 3:42:18.400]  Of course, we had the announcement. Boris Johnson, in all his infinite wisdom, announced on Saturday that England would be placed under a second debilitating lockdown.
[3:42:18.400 --> 3:42:26.400]  They basically came out, put some graphs up, which said, if we don't lockdown, 4,000 people a day are going to die.
[3:42:26.400 --> 3:42:38.400]  They pulled the same stunt that they always pull. They vastly over exaggerate the death figures, announced the lockdown, and then when the death figures are below that 4,000 number a day,
[3:42:38.400 --> 3:42:46.400]  which they would have been anyway without a lockdown, because before the first lockdown, the fatalities were already falling before it was imposed,
[3:42:46.400 --> 3:42:55.400]  then they can come out and claim, well, look, there were going to be 4,000 deaths a day. There were less than that. So lockdowns work.
[3:42:55.400 --> 3:43:01.400]  And now we're continuing to feel the draconian grip of how this is being implemented.
[3:43:01.400 --> 3:43:09.400]  Corona lockdown cops quizzing people on their food purchases. Yes, once again, they're starting to inspect shopping bags.
[3:43:09.400 --> 3:43:13.400]  They're starting to ask people where they're going, what they're purchasing.
[3:43:13.400 --> 3:43:24.400]  This happened in Wales, which was already under a full lockdown before England, by the way, where cops quizzed a woman about what item she was about to purchase from a grocery store
[3:43:24.400 --> 3:43:33.400]  in another example of our COVID-19 rules being wrongly enforced. This is not in the law. This was in a village in Wales. It wasn't even in a major city.
[3:43:33.400 --> 3:43:41.400]  Police stopped the woman before she entered a branch of the spa convenience store and questioned her about what she was planning to buy.
[3:43:41.400 --> 3:43:47.400]  The woman said police asked her where she was going before she answered that she was going to spa to buy custard.
[3:43:47.400 --> 3:43:57.400]  Now we have the custard police. You're not allowed to buy custard because the cops asked if custard was an essential item to which the woman asked,
[3:43:57.400 --> 3:44:05.400]  well, would you have crumble without custard? They let her go. But again, the fact is they're literally interrogating people on the street saying, where are you going?
[3:44:05.400 --> 3:44:15.400]  What are you buying? Of course, we have stories back during the first lockdown where people would go to a shop to buy bottles of wine because all the pubs are closed, of course.
[3:44:15.400 --> 3:44:28.400]  And they would be told by the police completely outside of the law because it's not part of it that they're not allowed to buy wine and potato chips because they're, quote, not non-essential items.
[3:44:28.400 --> 3:44:35.400]  We literally have police patrolling the streets. Meanwhile, we have record stabbings. We have burglaries.
[3:44:35.400 --> 3:44:46.400]  Police saying they're not even having time to attend burglaries now. But if you dare to buy custard, wine or potato chips, you're going to be in big trouble.
[3:44:46.400 --> 3:44:56.400]  While in China, the origin of the coronavirus outbreak, Chinese revelers party in Wuhan nightclub while rest of Europe enters second lockdown.
[3:44:56.400 --> 3:45:09.400]  And yes, they're taking the piss once again. Bear in mind now, of course, that China's economy is completely recovered to pre-COVID levels, even as we prepare to enter into another debilitating lockdown,
[3:45:09.400 --> 3:45:14.400]  which will cause massive unemployment, massive poverty, hunger and starvation.
[3:45:14.400 --> 3:45:26.400]  While now footage out of China shows people in Wuhan dancing in close proximity in a nightclub without face masks, even as other European countries enter into a debilitating second lockdown.
[3:45:26.400 --> 3:45:33.400]  So they're not wearing masks. They're having big raves, big parties. Of course, we had a similar instance a couple of months ago.
[3:45:33.400 --> 3:45:42.400]  Again, out of Wuhan, the epicenter of the coronavirus outbreak, which showed thousands of people packed together enjoying a giant pool party disco.
[3:45:42.400 --> 3:45:54.400]  Now, at the time when this video was released, the Chinese Communist Party heralded the video as proof that the country had achieved a, quote, strategic victory in its fight against the coronavirus.
[3:45:54.400 --> 3:46:04.400]  So the country in which the virus originated, some claim was deliberately released by people within that country. Their economies completely recovered.
[3:46:04.400 --> 3:46:12.400]  Their populations out. They're not wearing masks. They're not social distancing. They're having massive pool parties. They're having massive raves.
[3:46:12.400 --> 3:46:23.400]  Meanwhile, our governments continue to pursue this disastrous lockdown policy that's proven to be completely useless, ineffective time and time again.
[3:46:23.400 --> 3:46:28.400]  I was going to wrap it up. War Room is coming up next. Breaking news at summit.news. Keep it right here.
[3:46:28.400 --> 3:46:38.400]  Look it up for yourself. The head of the Davos Group issued a report more than six months ago calling for world government to be openly established to respond to COVID-19.
[3:46:38.400 --> 3:46:48.400]  The COVID-19 was a blessing to lower the planet's carbon footprint. Since then, Prince Charles and countless others have come out and said the exact same thing.
[3:46:48.400 --> 3:46:59.400]  The most ancient form of total war is called siege. And that's when you cut people off from their resources. That's when you lock them down.
[3:46:59.400 --> 3:47:08.400]  And this isn't siege to make us capitulate to the globalists or just get rid of Donald Trump. That's only part of it. This is siege to literally train us to be poor and to get us into deep debt.
[3:47:08.400 --> 3:47:16.400]  So then the globalist social engineers can dictate how we live our lives with the social credits for surveillance threat.
[3:47:16.400 --> 3:47:21.400]  You've heard the U.S. Army saying our job is to kill people and break things. Well, that's what the lockdown's doing.
[3:47:21.400 --> 3:47:28.400]  It's starving the third world, millions and millions of debt. It's breaking down the supply chain in society. It's their mission.
[3:47:28.400 --> 3:47:36.400]  I once saw a bumper sticker that read, if you want your children to listen to you, whisper. And it's true.
[3:47:36.400 --> 3:47:47.400]  A lot of times if somebody's shouting and yelling, even if what they're talking about is important, people tend to tune it out. You know why I know that? Because I'm Alex Jones.
[3:47:47.400 --> 3:47:58.400]  And I've been pretty obnoxious over the years because I'm worried about the New World Order. And I read about all their plans to lock down civilization, starve the third world, and then enslave the first world.
[3:47:58.400 --> 3:48:11.400]  So I've been really, really loud and really, really aggressive and we've had a big effect. But now it's time to think about every different angle and every different way where you get people to think for themselves before it's too late.
[3:48:11.400 --> 3:48:21.400]  The lockdown, social distancing, the mask is meant to end human civilization. We are under a civilization collapse weapon.
[3:48:21.400 --> 3:48:28.400]  So this is Life and Death. Please share in FullWars.com and band our video and watch our live election coverage.
