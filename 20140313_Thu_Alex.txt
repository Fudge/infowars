[00:00.000 --> 00:11.480]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.480 --> 00:19.040]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.040 --> 00:49.000]  Texas Alex Jones there is a war it's happening
[00:49.000 --> 01:05.880]  now it will decide the fate of humanity the time to choose sides has come on the
[01:05.880 --> 01:11.040]  face of this globe there are more than 180 nations and less than six of them
[01:11.040 --> 01:15.600]  allow their citizens to keep their arms places like the United States and
[01:15.600 --> 01:21.920]  Switzerland there is a planetary move by the UN and powerful corporate interest
[01:21.920 --> 01:28.680]  to disarm populations the Attorney General famously told a meeting of media
[01:28.680 --> 01:32.280]  executives that they need to brainwash the public against the Second
[01:32.280 --> 01:37.520]  Amendment and create irrational fears that guns are this incredible danger in
[01:37.520 --> 01:41.720]  the hands of citizens one thing that I think is clear with young people and
[01:41.720 --> 01:45.560]  with adults as well is that we just have to be repetitive about this it's not
[01:45.560 --> 01:49.880]  enough to simply have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it every Monday
[01:49.880 --> 01:54.160]  we need to do this every day of the week and just really brainwash people into
[01:54.160 --> 01:58.960]  thinking about guns in a vastly different way the LA Times even had to
[01:58.960 --> 02:04.120]  admit that gun crime is down 51% in the last 20 years but that the public has
[02:04.120 --> 02:09.560]  the perception that there's more gun crime than ever but the people are
[02:09.560 --> 02:13.880]  starting to wake up all over the United States there are open carry rallies
[02:13.880 --> 02:18.960]  where the people are going out and retaking their liberties and openly
[02:18.960 --> 02:24.080]  carrying firearms that is still legal but that the media had made taboo a
[02:24.080 --> 02:29.800]  right that is not exercised is basically destroyed mayor Bloomberg financed by
[02:29.800 --> 02:34.440]  the World Bank sponsoring South by Southwest here in Austin has come into
[02:34.440 --> 02:38.320]  town and financed multiple anti-gun events where they're even talking about
[02:38.320 --> 02:43.600]  how to censor free speech on Facebook to shut down the argument so over a
[02:43.600 --> 02:50.160]  hundred Texans marched today in an open carry March and the good news is out of
[02:50.160 --> 02:54.360]  hundreds of people that our reporters talk to of trendies from California who
[02:54.360 --> 02:58.360]  visited Austin only two people didn't think citizens should be able to
[02:58.360 --> 03:03.840]  openly carry and keep firearms we are winning the fight Congress only has a
[03:03.840 --> 03:07.560]  six percent approval rating of course the power structure wants to disarm us
[03:07.560 --> 03:12.160]  because they're scared that the public might someday under a tyranny defend
[03:12.160 --> 03:17.040]  themselves but what's really winning the Second Amendment fight is this
[03:17.040 --> 03:21.360]  yesterday I took out a bunch of Hollywood people shooting out of a friend's
[03:21.360 --> 03:25.040]  ranch and a lot of them had never shot guns and hadn't even been pro-gun
[03:25.040 --> 03:29.920]  previously and they totally got it and said I'm a good person why did the
[03:29.920 --> 03:34.120]  police just have guns I just shot all these guns including 50 cows it was fun
[03:34.120 --> 03:38.080]  it was safe you know there was one actress there who was shooting bullseye
[03:38.080 --> 03:42.000]  at 200 yards the first time she shot she's like wow I could be a person with
[03:42.000 --> 03:48.360]  guns and protect myself true feminism empowering women the fake feminists want
[03:48.360 --> 03:53.480]  men out of the picture to make the state the husband that's what the system
[03:53.480 --> 03:57.720]  admits they're doing and so we took these women and men out they shot firearms
[03:57.720 --> 04:02.400]  and were converted in the matter of hours over to fully understanding the
[04:02.400 --> 04:08.720]  spirit of 1776 and individual freedom and in closing we have a clip of some
[04:08.720 --> 04:13.120]  young geisha girls today down in south by southwest and downtown Austin when
[04:13.120 --> 04:18.920]  they were handed an m4 m16 variant their eyes just lit up
[04:18.920 --> 04:41.720]  this is the same thing I've seen every case if you can get a progressive
[04:41.720 --> 04:48.280]  government statist slave of the system out to fire firearms they will convert
[04:48.280 --> 04:53.600]  to a real liberal Thomas Jefferson style liberals become real liberals join
[04:53.600 --> 05:01.160]  the libertarians join the human empowerment movement in the last 50

[05:15.760 --> 05:21.280]  1924 the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to
[05:21.280 --> 05:26.800]  add iodine it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on

[08:23.040 --> 08:32.520]  resistance it's Alex Jones we reported on this last night at info wars com from
[08:32.520 --> 08:39.360]  the Ukrainian news it is in the New York Times today and the US government is
[08:39.360 --> 08:43.800]  confirming that is the occupied US government by the globalist is
[08:43.800 --> 08:48.840]  confirming that Russia is massing between 80,000 to 200,000 there's
[08:48.840 --> 08:55.040]  different reports troops on their western border with eastern Ukraine and
[08:55.040 --> 09:01.440]  Crimea and our massing tank divisions armored vehicles and mobile missile
[09:01.440 --> 09:07.320]  launchers anti-personnel anti-tank anti-helicopter and attack aircraft
[09:07.320 --> 09:15.040]  missiles it's a big deal I keep telling everybody this is a big deal and the
[09:15.040 --> 09:19.240]  Russians historically will end up attacking anybody that gets on their
[09:19.240 --> 09:23.880]  border or tries to destabilize their country and I mean who knows maybe the
[09:23.880 --> 09:26.280]  new order is gonna be able to defeat them we'll have a great nuclear war and
[09:26.280 --> 09:31.760]  Russia will be destroyed I you know my issue is America has been occupied by
[09:31.760 --> 09:36.240]  the globalist that are destroying our country deindustrializing us attacking
[09:36.240 --> 09:40.680]  our families attacking our culture trying to disarm us the Russians are not
[09:40.680 --> 09:45.600]  attacking anybody the Russians are not expanding the Russians have their own
[09:45.600 --> 09:50.400]  problems but they're not offensively doing anything and under common law
[09:50.400 --> 09:55.440]  common sense you're not supposed to sit there and mess with them the Ukrainians
[09:55.440 --> 09:59.760]  didn't go under EU control three months ago the Soros State Department
[09:59.760 --> 10:03.440]  operatives staged the overthrow of the elected government and sure I'm sure it
[10:03.440 --> 10:07.280]  was corrupt most governments are corrupt it certainly was corrupt and it was
[10:07.280 --> 10:12.080]  connected to Russia because the other side is connected to the EU and NATO and
[10:12.080 --> 10:17.560]  you are seeing a proxy war boys and girls on Russia's borders and Russia is
[10:17.560 --> 10:24.440]  not a red star communist system anymore we're more communist than they are they
[10:24.440 --> 10:28.640]  certainly are authoritarian in Russia and becoming more so because when the
[10:28.640 --> 10:33.600]  West messes with them it gives them a real pretext to take liberty our
[10:33.600 --> 10:37.480]  government stages terror attacks finances al-Qaeda jihadis lets them
[10:37.480 --> 10:42.680]  attack us finances mental patients jihadis there's all sorts as a pretext
[10:42.680 --> 10:46.480]  to take our liberty but the Russians don't need to stage anything they've
[10:46.480 --> 10:52.480]  got the State Department and the Saudi intelligence openly funding al-Qaeda all
[10:52.480 --> 10:59.560]  over their borders blowing stuff up Cheshire the list goes on and on and now
[10:59.560 --> 11:04.040]  the West is trying to destabilize the internal Russian government in Moscow
[11:04.040 --> 11:08.840]  and they're doing it you know on the borders of Moscow on the borders of
[11:08.840 --> 11:16.560]  Russia and this could easily turn into a large war and if anybody attacks Russia
[11:16.560 --> 11:20.880]  with conventional weapons there's a good chance they're gonna use tactical
[11:20.880 --> 11:23.480]  nuclear weapons like they said they do in Georgia and they rolled them in and
[11:23.480 --> 11:27.480]  NATO blinked and backed off and I don't know if NATO is gonna blink this time
[11:27.480 --> 11:33.280]  NATO is run by Wall Street types in Europe in the US and London in England
[11:33.280 --> 11:38.240]  who make 40 to 1 bets on MF global and then don't get in trouble when they
[11:38.240 --> 11:45.440]  steal billions of dollars like John Corzine they are crazy crazy like a
[11:45.440 --> 11:48.840]  fox I mean they're in control because they've been bold and they've been on
[11:48.840 --> 11:53.320]  the offensive attack but at a certain point Napoleon dominates all of Europe
[11:53.320 --> 11:59.240]  he turns and invades Russia gets beaten Hitler beats all of Europe turns goes
[11:59.240 --> 12:05.360]  into Russia gets beaten and there were other cases of this before and the only
[12:05.360 --> 12:08.360]  reason you get beaten is because you're in it should be like invading the US I
[12:08.360 --> 12:14.520]  mean you're invading a big giant country of people that are willing to fight I
[12:14.520 --> 12:18.080]  mean we can't beat the people in Afghanistan folks because they're
[12:18.080 --> 12:21.120]  willing to fight you can make whatever moral judgments you want about them but
[12:21.120 --> 12:25.320]  I mean the Russians will go to nuclear war with us ladies and gentlemen they'll
[12:25.320 --> 12:28.880]  go take a bunch of shots of vodka turn the keys and launch the missiles I mean
[12:28.880 --> 12:34.120]  this is not a good situation is all I'm telling everybody and we're run by
[12:34.120 --> 12:39.880]  Obama who literally the globalists do have an anti-family anti-god anti-sovereignty
[12:39.880 --> 12:43.480]  agenda at the top there are more technocrats but in the mid-level and
[12:43.480 --> 12:52.280]  even high levels right up to the very top I mean this is kind of a trendy
[12:52.280 --> 12:58.360]  progressive jihad into Russia because Russia is paying people to have kids
[12:58.360 --> 13:04.040]  they're apologizing for eugenics in the 30s 40s 50s 60s 70s 80s their population
[13:04.040 --> 13:08.040]  has gone down by 30 plus percent they're dying and Russia's becoming more
[13:08.040 --> 13:12.840]  nationalistic and that threatens the New World Order they want their own New
[13:12.840 --> 13:17.360]  World Order Russia-based and believe me if Russia was trying to finance movements
[13:17.360 --> 13:20.520]  to take our guns if Russia was trying to finance movements to break up our
[13:20.520 --> 13:27.360]  families if Russia was trying to finance movements to do things like that I
[13:27.360 --> 13:32.160]  would become very anti-russian government and I would speak out against
[13:32.160 --> 13:36.400]  them in fact I saw some anti-gun reports on RT last year I played the
[13:36.400 --> 13:42.840]  reports and I said listen you're a foreign financed media outlet you know
[13:42.840 --> 13:45.560]  let's face it our so-called mainstream media is a state run as well let's just
[13:45.560 --> 13:49.400]  be honest about it Russia's doesn't hide it I said you run anti-gun crap on RT
[13:49.400 --> 13:53.000]  America I'm gonna start a campaign to have your license pulled get the hell out
[13:53.000 --> 13:56.840]  of my country and by the way they had the host come on and say it was their
[13:56.840 --> 14:06.080]  idea not RT to be in and they apologized to me on air so let's get this clear
[14:06.080 --> 14:11.400]  if the Russians try to take one of my freedoms I'm gonna become anti-russian
[14:11.400 --> 14:15.800]  government they're not doing that folks I got foreign New World Order bankers
[14:15.800 --> 14:20.480]  perched on top of me and my family and your family literally shutting this
[14:20.480 --> 14:25.200]  country down what do you think cloward and piven Obamacare is I mean even the
[14:25.200 --> 14:31.040]  founder of the architect of Obamacare the main architect Ezekiel Emanuel said
[14:31.040 --> 14:35.360]  no the plans to bankrupt the system of course it is of course there's death
[14:35.360 --> 14:39.800]  panels of course it doubles and triples prices of course I told you the
[14:39.800 --> 14:43.240]  website wasn't gonna work I told you it didn't work on purpose to make that the
[14:43.240 --> 14:48.320]  distraction they now admit that it's all a giant screw job I told you that
[14:48.320 --> 14:51.720]  million-plus idiots that thought they'd signed up we're gonna go into
[14:51.720 --> 14:55.240]  hospitals thinking they had Obamacare and then they didn't have it almost no
[14:55.240 --> 15:00.680]  one signed up unless you go in by hand with health and human services that's
[15:00.680 --> 15:04.760]  admitted no one has signed up digitally properly they just think they have then
[15:04.760 --> 15:09.600]  they've been data-mined so the IRS knows where to go get your bank account or
[15:09.600 --> 15:12.920]  where to garnish your wages and now that's admitted people say how did you
[15:12.920 --> 15:16.640]  know everything they do because these crooks folks are like a dog going back
[15:16.640 --> 15:21.360]  to its vomit it's like saying how do I know how dogs act at a dog bark I'm a
[15:21.360 --> 15:26.600]  dog fancier folks I've had dogs my whole life I don't have dogs act how do I know
[15:26.600 --> 15:31.160]  how to go out in the right weather and catch bass and know where to put my line
[15:31.160 --> 15:35.200]  because I've done a little bit of bass fishing I've done a lot of studying the
[15:35.200 --> 15:40.960]  New World Order folks and they act pathologically it's criminology they do
[15:40.960 --> 15:47.320]  the same stuff over and over and over again with new permutations and new
[15:47.320 --> 15:52.360]  modern advancements in tyranny and oppression and propaganda and disinformation
[15:52.360 --> 16:01.440]  and brainwashing and baiting and switching and spinning but now now it
[16:01.440 --> 16:06.320]  we cannot have this type of stuff with nuclear weapons involved World War I
[16:06.320 --> 16:09.880]  and World War II started with proxy state actions what Brazinski and the
[16:09.880 --> 16:13.480]  globalists think they cannot have a nuclear war if they use proxy states
[16:13.480 --> 16:17.280]  that's how all the big wars have started in the last 300 years you guys aren't
[16:17.280 --> 16:21.800]  doing something new with proxy wars using smaller countries as your battle
[16:21.800 --> 16:31.320]  ground like Vietnam or countless other examples Afghanistan I mean I got to be
[16:31.320 --> 16:33.600]  honest with you folks that there's a real good chance this could cause a
[16:33.600 --> 16:36.840]  regional war even World War III I mean that's what most analysts are saying too
[16:36.840 --> 16:41.000]  and we're just sitting here watching it happen watching our leaders do it again
[16:41.000 --> 16:48.120]  and with Obama there's a real ideology to Obama obviously being bi bisexual
[16:48.120 --> 16:52.520]  Hillary bisexual most of us doesn't even against those people folks it just that
[16:52.520 --> 16:55.960]  the problem is they discriminate you don't get in the liberal higher clubs
[16:55.960 --> 17:00.120]  unless you are and so most the White House is and that's on come out it's on
[17:00.120 --> 17:04.880]  record and they really have a problem with Putin that he's not gonna let him
[17:04.880 --> 17:07.960]  go over there and teach five-year-old Russian children how to have gay anal
[17:07.960 --> 17:12.440]  sex I mean you know they're a bunch of pervs and not attacking them because
[17:12.440 --> 17:16.040]  they're bisexuals but that that's grown into a bunch of wanting to recruit
[17:16.040 --> 17:19.160]  children which becomes pedophilia and I'm against that you can call me you know a
[17:19.160 --> 17:23.000]  conspiracy theorist or old-fashioned I'm not trendy but I think you know it's
[17:23.000 --> 17:26.440]  illegal I think it's horrible and oppressive and exploits children and
[17:26.440 --> 17:31.800]  they want and they hear in America teach young children absolutely horrible
[17:31.800 --> 17:34.560]  stuff you know Jocelyn elders wanted to teach five-year-olds out of masturbate
[17:34.560 --> 17:37.880]  she said reach down and show them how to do it and I hate after you know to bring
[17:37.880 --> 17:42.280]  stuff up like this but this is what they do we live in a giant mind control
[17:42.280 --> 17:48.280]  facility and you've got a bunch of you know Obama you know raised by his
[17:48.280 --> 17:53.200]  tranny nanny and the rest of it and he's upset that they can't do that in
[17:53.200 --> 17:57.800]  Russia they're very upset about that you can make whatever judgments you want
[17:57.800 --> 18:01.640]  about the Russians nobody who's quote gay is being oppressed in Russia folks the
[18:01.640 --> 18:04.340]  thing is they're not gonna have state-run media promoting it it's a
[18:04.340 --> 18:08.680]  depopulation agenda it's on Russian TV Russian TV now sounds like the Alex
[18:08.680 --> 18:12.160]  Jones show in many cases the guy that runs the big-state run media over there
[18:12.160 --> 18:16.160]  I've seen the transcripts sounds like you know he listens to my show and I by
[18:16.160 --> 18:19.560]  the way I've been invited on big national state-run Russian TV and I don't
[18:19.560 --> 18:23.240]  even do it they offered me to come on last week live and I've just declined it
[18:23.240 --> 18:26.800]  because I'm just not gonna get in the middle of it the point is there's the
[18:26.800 --> 18:29.920]  Russians know what's going on and they're going do we really want to commit
[18:29.920 --> 18:34.080]  suicide we really not want to have any future generation do we really imagine
[18:34.080 --> 18:38.160]  us at the Olympics people don't think of John Wayne or anything or they don't
[18:38.160 --> 18:42.880]  think of Americana George Washington guns cowboys private property frontier
[18:42.880 --> 18:46.560]  Native Americans all the cool stuff about America they didn't think about that
[18:46.560 --> 18:50.280]  it was all about men dressing up like women and stuff and hey man if you want
[18:50.280 --> 18:54.480]  to do that whatever I'm not obsessed with that don't think for a minute that
[18:54.480 --> 18:58.680]  you know I'm trying to rain on your parade my whole issue is we don't want
[18:58.680 --> 19:06.520]  that to be the national anthem that is not what everyone wants to live like and

[19:11.720 --> 19:18.680]  accept a bunch of women ruling over a feminine men in dresses we don't we want

[24:10.520 --> 24:15.720]  live I think Terminator judgment day music is fitting here for the
[24:15.720 --> 24:20.080]  transmission today dealing with thermal nuclear war chairman a joint chief says
[24:20.080 --> 24:29.400]  us ready for military response in Ukraine that is being reported by zero
[24:29.400 --> 24:34.560]  hedge with links to the website of the Atlantic Council that basically advises
[24:34.560 --> 24:38.560]  and runs the National Security Council of the foreign bankers that control the
[24:38.560 --> 24:43.960]  country so Wall Street and the globalist banksters are ready for military
[24:43.960 --> 24:48.440]  response of the quote US Army is ready to back up Ukraine and its allies in
[24:48.440 --> 24:52.240]  Europe with military actions close quote says chairman of the joint chiefs of
[24:52.240 --> 24:59.960]  staff Dempsey general Martin Dempsey again has claimed that in the case of the
[24:59.960 --> 25:04.120]  escalation of unrest in Crimea the US Army is ready to back up Ukraine its
[25:04.120 --> 25:08.920]  allies in Europe with military actions boy isn't that just a wonderful
[25:08.920 --> 25:17.400]  wonderfully horrible announcement now Russia because I studied what happened
[25:17.400 --> 25:24.960]  back in 1940 with Stalin and Hitler Stalin Hitler had a pact and they agreed
[25:24.960 --> 25:30.760]  to then invade Poland secretly but to have the Russians claim they were doing
[25:30.760 --> 25:37.080]  it to make sure that the Germans didn't take all of Poland and with the Germans
[25:37.080 --> 25:39.960]  claiming they took it to make sure the Russians didn't take all of Poland
[25:39.960 --> 25:44.280]  because one side of Poland was more pro-German had more German rooted
[25:44.280 --> 25:47.800]  citizens and the other side of Poland just like Ukraine was more Russian
[25:47.800 --> 25:51.440]  influenced with those two empires always influencing each other the Austrian
[25:51.440 --> 25:55.920]  Hungarian and then of course the Russian Tsarist Empire so it's almost a
[25:55.920 --> 26:02.000]  replay of what happened then the Germans a few years later in operation
[26:02.000 --> 26:07.760]  Barbarossa double crossed the Russians and went into eastern Poland driving the
[26:07.760 --> 26:13.400]  Russians out and then right up to Leningrad slash Stalingrad and just a
[26:13.400 --> 26:17.120]  few hundred miles away from Moscow and of course the fought there for a year or
[26:17.120 --> 26:21.400]  so and then finally failed and then the Russians began their big drive into
[26:21.400 --> 26:28.120]  Berlin and the downfall of Adolf Alois Hitler and his bunker if you believe the
[26:28.120 --> 26:33.680]  official reports which probably are true the point is is that all of that is
[26:33.680 --> 26:39.800]  history we know it it was a war that killed conservatively 50 million people
[26:39.800 --> 26:45.520]  worldwide 20 million of them Germans 21 million Germans on average if you look
[26:45.520 --> 26:50.600]  at the numbers there's the numbers very 18 to 25 million 21 million Germans died
[26:50.600 --> 27:00.800]  20 plus mill just remember that and understand that it could be that a
[27:00.800 --> 27:05.760]  deal has been made between Putin and the globalist to just divide Ukraine right
[27:05.760 --> 27:08.920]  down the middle that's why the Russian back government stood down when they
[27:08.920 --> 27:12.120]  were attacking police and let the protest get out of control it's why the
[27:12.120 --> 27:15.760]  West helped fund it and is now trying to escalate it the Russians then grab
[27:15.760 --> 27:19.880]  Crimea to secure their gas lines it's traditionally been part of Russia
[27:19.880 --> 27:24.320]  anyways they grabbed the gas lines and their military bases and then now
[27:24.320 --> 27:29.960]  Putin says he'll stop and won't go in the rest of Crimea if the Ukrainians
[27:29.960 --> 27:34.520]  don't attack their bases but then the Ukrainians are building up for an
[27:34.520 --> 27:38.600]  attack that arms build up has been going on for over a week and a half the
[27:38.600 --> 27:42.520]  Ukrainians have one of the biggest standing armies in the world in their
[27:42.520 --> 27:46.600]  reserve one million people in the Ukrainian reserves and they are now
[27:46.600 --> 27:52.200]  massing more than 300,000 Ukrainian troops 100,000 of them regular army
[27:52.200 --> 27:56.720]  armored vehicles tanks helicopters you name it to attack Russian positions
[27:56.720 --> 28:01.880]  and are calling for a military response from NATO this all public so
[28:01.880 --> 28:05.880]  everybody's busy worried about South by Southwest and oh my gosh as you hear
[28:05.880 --> 28:09.320]  cayenne west or whatever his name it was in town or JZ or whatever their names
[28:09.320 --> 28:14.800]  are you know Justin Bieber while we're worried about all that war three could
[28:14.800 --> 28:19.240]  be starting it might not start it might start because here's the deal the
[28:19.240 --> 28:23.160]  globalist financial meltdown is happening now we're sitting on 1.5
[28:23.160 --> 28:28.480]  quadrillion in derivatives 1,500 billion in derivatives so all of that is
[28:28.480 --> 28:33.240]  going on all of that is unfolding and they're gonna want a big war while that
[28:33.240 --> 28:39.120]  happens now again maybe maybe this is a back room deal to divide Ukraine and
[28:39.120 --> 28:42.840]  Russia gets half the spoils and gets to take liberties and save a rattle with
[28:42.840 --> 28:47.120]  the West and back their government up and the US and NATO and the EU get to
[28:47.120 --> 28:50.280]  have a big political fight and divert everybody from the financial meltdown
[28:50.280 --> 28:55.560]  and suck dry half of Ukraine as a snack like the EU has been doing all other
[28:55.560 --> 29:01.880]  countries in the EU it's like opting into brain cancer to join the EU and I
[29:01.880 --> 29:04.640]  think it's opting into something not too good to try to join with Russia as well
[29:04.640 --> 29:07.760]  the point is is Ukraine should be neutral but the Western powers and the
[29:07.760 --> 29:11.560]  Eastern powers are not gonna let them do that so there's a there's a I don't
[29:11.560 --> 29:17.240]  know there's a chance in negotiations they're gonna divide the country I've
[29:17.240 --> 29:22.880]  said day one I think that's how that's gonna end if the West keeps pushing but
[29:22.880 --> 29:28.160]  if they attack the Russians it'll just be war and then I guess you'll have about
[29:28.160 --> 29:32.320]  20 minutes once that starts to go see your family give them some kisses and
[29:32.320 --> 29:38.000]  then try to get into a shelter before the ICBMs come in and the cruise missiles
[29:38.000 --> 29:41.640]  come in from the submarines off the coast and before the sleeper teams the
[29:41.640 --> 29:45.760]  Russian sleeper teams start detonating nukes in major cities so and of course
[29:45.760 --> 29:51.000]  the Russians will all be basically killed as well we're on the March the

[35:23.560 --> 35:28.480]  Obama's bacon out of the political fire so they can get their whole agenda through
[35:28.480 --> 35:33.880]  the war with Russia is the false flag ladies and gentlemen it is the
[35:33.880 --> 35:40.120]  diversion Ukraine crisis u.s. to sell some crude oil from strategic
[35:40.120 --> 35:45.680]  petroleum reserve in latest tit for tat with Russia's strongman Putin
[35:46.880 --> 35:51.680]  Venezuela burns as anti-government protests continue in Caracas this is
[35:51.680 --> 35:55.480]  not Ukraine it's Venezuela the news of Australia reports all the world has been
[35:55.480 --> 36:00.400]  focused on a missing plane violent clashes have set the country's capital
[36:00.400 --> 36:04.360]  on fire student protesters have clashed with soldiers in the streets of Caracas
[36:04.360 --> 36:09.880]  again today as three more fatal shootings raised the death toll to 25 as a
[36:09.880 --> 36:13.600]  month of demonstrations against Venezuela's socialist government
[36:13.600 --> 36:19.520]  intensifies around 3,000 supporters and opponents of Venezuela's president took
[36:19.520 --> 36:22.840]  to the streets of the country's capital to mark the one month since the protest
[36:22.840 --> 36:27.680]  erupted and again the top story I just can't even get any of the news this is
[36:27.680 --> 36:31.760]  so huge chairman of the joint chiefs of staff tells the Atlantic Council they're
[36:31.760 --> 36:36.000]  ready for military response to back the Ukraine coup government against the
[36:36.000 --> 36:40.760]  Russians and the Russians are massing hundreds of thousands of troops the
[36:40.760 --> 36:44.480]  New York Times reports on their border
[36:44.480 --> 36:54.640]  isn't that just special and I guess you know Obama's on vacation again and he
[36:54.640 --> 36:59.840]  could shoot hoops so you know where Hitler failed and where Napoleon failed
[36:59.840 --> 37:06.120]  he said he was gonna win in Afghanistan he got absolutely routed with the surge
[37:06.120 --> 37:11.080]  and everything that's just more targets for al Qaeda and Taliban to kill because
[37:11.080 --> 37:15.240]  resistance is victory and you don't have the moral high ground being in
[37:15.240 --> 37:19.640]  Afghanistan 12 years you don't have the moral high ground attack of Russia you
[37:19.640 --> 37:23.040]  don't have the moral high ground doing all this stuff this is not our government
[37:23.040 --> 37:26.880]  doing this ladies and gentlemen only crazy people would do stuff like this
[37:26.880 --> 37:30.520]  or people that stand again off crises who make money off all the different
[37:30.520 --> 37:36.200]  sides and that's the globalist that's George Soros that dirtbag he was 14 15
[37:36.200 --> 37:41.160]  years old in a Nazi collaborator who would infiltrate and knew the Jews
[37:41.160 --> 37:45.440]  different tactics to try to evade being picked up in Eastern Europe and he would
[37:45.440 --> 37:48.880]  go around and find them and shake them down and send them to the force labor
[37:48.880 --> 37:53.200]  camps and he's the guy financing getting rid of free speech in the Second
[37:53.200 --> 37:57.240]  Amendment and who has groups he finances like media matters calling for us to
[37:57.240 --> 38:01.520]  basically be shut down and he's over there trying to start war with Russia I
[38:01.520 --> 38:08.320]  mean how crazy is a 15 year old Nazi collaborator who's now almost 90 years
[38:08.320 --> 38:15.400]  old eighty-something how old is that son of a man I tell you I mean I am just
[38:15.400 --> 38:22.080]  sick of it I am so tired of this person who's just gonna make money off the
[38:22.080 --> 38:25.680]  crisis makes money trying to bring down England make money on brand to bring
[38:25.680 --> 38:32.080]  down Australia makes money off trying to bring down the dollar he is a record you
[38:32.080 --> 38:34.440]  know the records where they've had them in every culture but England has the
[38:34.440 --> 38:37.880]  most famous records one back about 400 years ago down by Cornwall in the
[38:37.880 --> 38:43.080]  southern coast they would put up fake lighthouses during foggy weather and they
[38:43.080 --> 38:46.920]  had local County rules where if a ship wrecked on the rocks you know a mile
[38:46.920 --> 38:51.160]  out quarter mile out on the on the big rocks they would go out and be able to
[38:51.160 --> 38:54.600]  get the goods and most of sailors would dire come into shore and then they would
[38:54.600 --> 38:58.360]  come out with their ships the next day when the fog cleared and clean everything
[38:58.360 --> 39:04.120]  out of the wreck boats kind of like buzzard vulture capitalism I think so
[39:04.120 --> 39:08.880]  way to describe it crony see just it has the word capitalism in its name it's
[39:08.880 --> 39:14.600]  the opposite of real free market capitalism it's our enemy it's our
[39:14.600 --> 39:20.160]  enemy and George Horos is our enemy and Al Gore is our enemy they are the
[39:20.160 --> 39:25.280]  virulent metastasizing cancer and the Republican Party it's like the rest of
[39:25.280 --> 39:29.440]  the body going you can go ahead and have the lungs in the brain we're just the
[39:29.440 --> 39:36.000]  guts eat us last because in the time frame I guess these old 70 80 year old
[39:36.000 --> 39:39.440]  Republicans getting their payoffs in the blueblades they're being blackmailed and
[39:39.440 --> 39:43.760]  they got their daily pension of hookers and mistresses and everything else up
[39:43.760 --> 39:47.440]  there in DC and the and they're just like they they openly say hey just leave
[39:47.440 --> 39:51.720]  us alone you can have it all yeah you can teach the kids two plus two equals
[39:51.720 --> 39:55.720]  five you can teach five-year-olds how to you know dress like a woman
[39:55.720 --> 39:59.400]  five-year-old boys yeah you can arrest people for drawing a picture of a gun
[39:59.400 --> 40:03.760]  yeah you can totally do whatever you want just just leave us alone and of
[40:03.760 --> 40:06.440]  course if you idiots think you're gonna be left alone when the globalist fully
[40:06.440 --> 40:11.080]  take over you got nothing coming they're gonna arrest and jail and set you up and
[40:11.080 --> 40:16.840]  ruin you you fools you idiots John Boehner and all the rest of you are
[40:16.840 --> 40:21.480]  absolutely collaborating filth and you have no common sense and you don't
[40:21.480 --> 40:26.080]  study history and you cannot feel the impending doom you cannot have feel the
[40:26.080 --> 40:31.120]  dread of the of the gates of the Republic fully falling you think the
[40:31.120 --> 40:35.000]  country's overrun by criminal operations right now we're only dealing with the
[40:35.000 --> 40:40.200]  vanguard scouts of the new world order right now when those shields and those
[40:40.200 --> 40:46.240]  gates when the hedge which is starting to fall when the gate goes down folks the
[40:46.240 --> 40:51.800]  new world order literally has hated American barbarian guts as America was
[40:51.800 --> 40:57.160]  founded by barbarian invasions and was endless barbarian wars before that with
[40:57.160 --> 41:00.960]  the Native Americans this was the Wild Wild West this was Conan the barbarian
[41:00.960 --> 41:06.560]  for real this was all the swashbucklers and criminals and pirates and adventurers
[41:06.560 --> 41:12.400]  and runners and real men and the slaves half of which would die on the ships over
[41:12.400 --> 41:16.320]  and and and the sailors half of which would die and every three missions out
[41:16.320 --> 41:21.200]  just the absolute creme dollar creme of humanity founded this country and that's
[41:21.200 --> 41:26.840]  why we were the apple of the world's eye the real swashbucklers and the new
[41:26.840 --> 41:32.080]  world order is going to bring us down they hate us the technocratic ancient
[41:32.080 --> 41:37.120]  French British and other elites and the Rothschild elites they're all the same
[41:37.120 --> 41:45.560]  inbred together they hate human vitality they hate surging power they hate
[41:45.560 --> 41:51.520]  Renaissance they hate powerful feminine women and I saw a painting one time and
[41:51.520 --> 41:55.800]  I want to get a print of if you type in cave woman it's a painting from like the
[41:55.800 --> 42:02.640]  18th century and it's it's it's an artist rendition of a cave woman with
[42:02.640 --> 42:06.520]  her kids behind her with a saber-toothed cat coming into the cave and it's the
[42:06.520 --> 42:10.480]  sexiest looking woman I've ever seen I need to find that painting and that's
[42:10.480 --> 42:14.840]  what I want hanging up is a big giant painting of that because the men are
[42:14.840 --> 42:18.360]  going out hunting and the big cats coming in and she's got like a club in
[42:18.360 --> 42:23.400]  her hand they do not want that they want women disarmed totally mindless
[42:23.400 --> 42:29.360]  believing the television culture cut off from the men the state is their
[42:29.360 --> 42:34.240]  husband and they're doing it it is incredible they turn the men into
[42:34.240 --> 42:40.920]  arrested development cowards that think watching football is what's manly I've
[42:40.920 --> 42:44.840]  kind of digress ladies and gentlemen the point is is that the globalist want us
[42:44.840 --> 42:48.640]  domesticated so they can do whatever they want to us and use us and they're
[42:48.640 --> 42:53.360]  going after any national sovereign country that's red-blooded and aggressive
[42:53.360 --> 42:56.380]  that hasn't been dominated and the British Empire that's that's
[42:56.380 --> 43:01.840]  metastasized into the American globalist new world order Wall Street Empire has
[43:01.840 --> 43:06.160]  been wanting to bring down the Russian system forever the czars were corrupt
[43:06.160 --> 43:09.280]  and ancient whatever but they weren't anti-russian they had to be brought down
[43:09.280 --> 43:13.680]  then they put the Bolshevik standard to try to destroy Russian culture and create
[43:13.680 --> 43:17.560]  a hellish situation and then now that's been rejected by Alexander Shultz and
[43:17.560 --> 43:20.960]  Ethan and others there's a battle within the heart and soul of Russia for the
[43:20.960 --> 43:26.320]  Shultz and Ethan vision of a strong nationalistic Russia with children and
[43:26.320 --> 43:29.800]  a growing population moving forward and the old Bolshevik attitudes that are
[43:29.800 --> 43:34.480]  still there but the lust and I don't mean that in a bad way but the drive the
[43:34.480 --> 43:39.640]  hunger for true liberty is in the Russians it's in Americans it's in
[43:39.640 --> 43:45.840]  everybody and it unifies humanity around exploration interstellar but also here
[43:45.840 --> 43:49.840]  on this planet and exploration of our own psyches and excellent and an
[43:49.840 --> 43:55.400]  exploration of our own potential and it is that choice the agenda 21 anti-human
[43:55.400 --> 44:00.340]  dehumanization lowering IQ glowing the dark people shuffling around from
[44:00.340 --> 44:05.120]  trendy event to trendy event totally empty totally mindless downloading
[44:05.120 --> 44:10.280]  whatever new psychological cultural template is given to them or the
[44:10.280 --> 44:14.760]  animating contest of men and women and striving and free association and
[44:14.760 --> 44:19.920]  letting there be winners and losers in dodgeball and football and track and
[44:19.920 --> 44:26.460]  essays to to to to build and empower competition which we know is like
[44:26.460 --> 44:31.160]  gravity without gravity your bones turn to mush your heart to disintegrates and
[44:31.160 --> 44:37.840]  the globalists are removing the cultural gravity and and pressures from the
[44:37.840 --> 44:42.480]  population and putting chemicals into the water and food on record to sedate
[44:42.480 --> 44:48.240]  the public for the long slide as we split our risk culturally in a hot bath
[44:48.240 --> 45:00.400]  into exterminism that is the new order plan I reject it I say no to it I mean
[45:00.400 --> 45:05.840]  this is the ultimate evil we face now now I digress we've looked at the big
[45:05.840 --> 45:10.360]  global scale let's zoom in to a local scale now and I'm sending reporters out
[45:10.360 --> 45:16.200]  there right now in fact I've got great reporters but but but yeah they came in
[45:16.200 --> 45:20.600]  and asked me this morning you know should we go out and report on driver
[45:20.600 --> 45:24.520]  runs car into South by Southwest crowd killing to the doctors are saying
[45:24.520 --> 45:29.200]  unfortunately looks like two more may die and injuring at least 23 people
[45:29.200 --> 45:34.800]  after he ran away from a cop that was trying to pull him over at a DUI not
[45:34.800 --> 45:40.640]  checkpoint but pullover and yes default if something like I have an airplane
[45:40.640 --> 45:43.840]  crashes at the airport don't wait for me to tell you go the airport go the
[45:43.840 --> 45:50.480]  airport if you know some world leader just arrives and is you know walking
[45:50.480 --> 45:55.240]  around go interview him yes go and I want you guys to go down there and bring
[45:55.240 --> 46:02.800]  up the fact that hey this guy runs from police down the wrong way smashes
[46:02.800 --> 46:06.680]  through barriers where they had six streets shut down for the festivals
[46:06.680 --> 46:12.160]  tries to run over police runs over more than 20 plus people there's reports of
[46:12.160 --> 46:16.760]  folks flying around the air like bowling pins we're gonna play in a moment and
[46:16.760 --> 46:19.880]  the police chief has said they're gonna go for two counts of capital murder which
[46:19.880 --> 46:23.400]  means you'll get executed which it is premeditated you got somebody in front of
[46:23.400 --> 46:31.720]  God and everybody else driving around running over people and they still this
[46:31.720 --> 46:35.880]  happened like midnight last night they still at 12 30 a.m. they still not
[46:35.880 --> 46:41.800]  released who he is or who she is and we're guessing it's a man and they will
[46:41.800 --> 46:46.520]  not announce who it is so it's either an illegal alien or it's somebody who was
[46:46.520 --> 46:51.880]  on some psychotropic drug who was completely out of their mind because
[46:51.880 --> 46:57.000]  every time they don't release who it is it's because they're trying to get the
[46:57.000 --> 47:00.520]  story together and I think this is a terrible situation I'm not blaming the
[47:00.520 --> 47:03.280]  police and anything here so I'm not I'm not here we're coming up with a
[47:03.280 --> 47:07.920]  conspiracy I'm saying tell us the person's name I don't like the fact this
[47:07.920 --> 47:16.880]  person has been in their in their hands for 11 12 hours this is about 11 hours
[47:16.880 --> 47:23.280]  ten and a half hours I want to know the name of this person I want to know who
[47:23.280 --> 47:32.080]  they are I want to hear who they are I want to know their name I want to know
[47:32.080 --> 47:37.920]  their MO I want to know it release the information now and they they said an
[47:37.920 --> 47:40.480]  hour ago our day Savetta was set to give a press conference we'll come out and
[47:40.480 --> 47:45.560]  give it then now this is what I've said my reporters down there for oh yes it's
[47:45.560 --> 47:50.800]  very tragic two dead more may die 23 injured there's still shoes and blood
[47:50.800 --> 47:53.520]  all over the ground reportedly because it's a crime scene this goes on for
[47:53.520 --> 47:56.720]  blocks after blocks this person was driving around like it was grand theft
[47:56.720 --> 48:04.080]  auto are we gonna ban cars in Texas because cars are used to kill hundreds
[48:04.080 --> 48:09.040]  every year people use hundreds hundreds of people die every year when someone
[48:09.040 --> 48:13.480]  uses a car as a weapon happens every couple days you see it in the news do we
[48:13.480 --> 48:16.680]  ban cars they're trying to ban butcher knives in England right now because their
[48:16.680 --> 48:20.200]  crime rates gone up more than 10 fold with knives they have a crime rate three
[48:20.200 --> 48:24.080]  times what the US is violent crime rate they just use baseball bats trudge and
[48:24.080 --> 48:31.000]  daggers you know weapons like that and are we gonna ban knives and people are
[48:31.000 --> 48:34.460]  gonna say well of course not he's a bad guy well no no shouldn't you turn your
[48:34.460 --> 48:38.880]  car in because you might use your car to hurt somebody people are gonna say
[48:38.880 --> 48:41.840]  well of course not we'll go well should we turn our guns in then what somebody
[48:41.840 --> 48:45.240]  does something bad with a gun that's what I want my reporters to go out show
[48:45.240 --> 48:50.600]  the report what happened and then show talk to the trendies and see if they
[48:50.600 --> 48:55.360]  understand that logic because that's what we do here we hijack news stories so
[48:55.360 --> 48:58.200]  that's not just a news story where the system puts it out two dimensionally
[48:58.200 --> 49:02.240]  we've been connected to common sense and everything else that's what I want my
[49:02.240 --> 49:05.440]  reporters to go out and do in fact whoever's not doing I think it's David

[54:09.240 --> 54:15.200]  in 1814 we took a little trip along the Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi
[54:15.200 --> 54:18.960]  we took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody
[54:18.960 --> 54:22.960]  British in a town in New Orleans we fired our guns and the British kept
[54:22.960 --> 54:27.720]  becoming there wasn't as many as there was a while ago we fired once more and
[54:27.720 --> 54:33.440]  they began to run it on down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico
[54:33.440 --> 54:37.920]  we looked down a river and we see the British come and they must have been a
[54:37.920 --> 54:41.720]  hundred of them beating on the drums they stepped so high and they made the
[54:41.720 --> 54:45.720]  bugles ring we stood beside our cotton bales and didn't say a thing we fired
[54:45.720 --> 54:49.840]  our guns and the British kept becoming there wasn't as many as there was a
[54:49.840 --> 54:54.800]  while ago we fired once more and they began to run it on down the Mississippi to
[54:54.800 --> 55:00.440]  the Gulf of Mexico all right ladies and gentlemen the police chief has had his
[55:00.440 --> 55:04.080]  press conference and our reporters were down there so they did a great job we're
[55:04.080 --> 55:07.760]  gonna have that we also were able to ask some questions our reporters are
[55:07.760 --> 55:13.320]  telling us the suspect is reportedly a black male we're going to find out
[55:13.320 --> 55:16.440]  exactly what's going on I don't think there's much suspect about it the
[55:16.440 --> 55:19.920]  person's pulled out of the car that just ran over all these people but it is a
[55:19.920 --> 55:24.600]  serious tragic situation to see this happening and Jakari just came in here
[55:24.600 --> 55:27.720]  during the break and he says I don't look like a jerk he rarely bucks me on
[55:27.720 --> 55:30.720]  questions I want to go out and ask the public he goes I don't look like a jerk
[55:30.720 --> 55:34.960]  going out to a scene with dead and dying people from last night and say hey what
[55:34.960 --> 55:39.080]  do you think of this tragedy that we should ban cars because you know a car
[55:39.080 --> 55:46.320]  was used to kill people but I mean no they say ban guns and and it's just as
[55:46.320 --> 55:50.160]  asinine because a bad person uses a gun in England they want licenses for
[55:50.160 --> 55:54.520]  butcher knives that's BBC news that guy's put into BBC
[55:54.520 --> 55:58.120]  forget the press conference guys it doesn't matter it's good I don't want

[1:00:19.720 --> 1:00:38.960]  Alex Jones I'm a little bit wound up today you know because the West is
[1:00:38.960 --> 1:00:43.000]  trying to start a war with Russia and then if you point that out some people
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:46.760]  a minority of folks on the controlled right and controlled left go why do you
[1:00:46.760 --> 1:00:50.720]  love out of mere Putin what do you have a calendar of Vladimir Putin that you
[1:00:50.720 --> 1:00:54.840]  worship at night actually have those as a joke somebody made around the office
[1:00:54.840 --> 1:00:58.760]  and I'm like no I just don't like starting wars with Russia and clearly
[1:00:58.760 --> 1:01:02.320]  the West is doing that and now the Russians are massing troops on their
[1:01:02.320 --> 1:01:06.000]  border with Ukraine they're on the eastern border of Ukraine on the Western
[1:01:06.000 --> 1:01:12.320]  side of Russia this is a big situation and I guess it's patriotic to be for war
[1:01:12.320 --> 1:01:16.120]  with Russia if your country is overrun by criminals that are using your nation
[1:01:16.120 --> 1:01:19.640]  to carry out criminal operations so that's just some of what we've got
[1:01:19.640 --> 1:01:23.480]  coming up John McAfee is here again he was here with us I don't know about four
[1:01:23.480 --> 1:01:27.160]  five months ago and he was going to be coming to shop by Southwest and said hey
[1:01:27.160 --> 1:01:30.720]  you want me to pop on the show he says he's got some breaking news you know it
[1:01:30.720 --> 1:01:35.040]  came out later he was contacted by the White House to fix their website of
[1:01:35.040 --> 1:01:38.320]  course that was all of hoax by them it was designed to be broken he went and
[1:01:38.320 --> 1:01:41.680]  said that day one here first then they got picked up all over the national news
[1:01:41.680 --> 1:01:48.360]  that's now been confirmed John McAfee is quite the character he could literally
[1:01:48.360 --> 1:01:55.040]  be a body double of Captain Morgan and he shot the 50 cal handheld better than me
[1:01:55.040 --> 1:01:58.880]  or even Shane Steiner I shot at the worst handheld Shane shot at the next
[1:01:58.880 --> 1:02:05.280]  best actually hitting targets at 200 yards away handheld and then McAfee was
[1:02:05.280 --> 1:02:08.800]  even better than us and of course that threw my back out again doesn't hurt my
[1:02:08.800 --> 1:02:13.360]  shoulder but makes my spine go to the other side my back's all swollen I did
[1:02:13.360 --> 1:02:17.520]  it again not with McAfee but with Mike judge I said I shot over 50 rounds like
[1:02:17.520 --> 1:02:23.720]  a hundred rounds some of it handheld and so bear with me today folks I'm a little
[1:02:23.720 --> 1:02:28.040]  bit irritable I feel like an ice pick has been jammed into my spine I'm not on
[1:02:28.040 --> 1:02:33.760]  painkillers either I don't like painkillers but long story short ladies
[1:02:33.760 --> 1:02:38.320]  and gentlemen I think my days of hand shooting 50 cows are over one of my
[1:02:38.320 --> 1:02:40.960]  buddies will show me a video this morning I think I meant to send it to the
[1:02:40.960 --> 1:02:46.320]  studio of a guy double-firing two Barrett's at the same time and I've done
[1:02:46.320 --> 1:02:49.720]  that before on tape but it looks so ridiculous that I didn't put it out that
[1:02:49.720 --> 1:02:53.380]  I could barely stand up shooting at once this big old mean-looking guy
[1:02:53.380 --> 1:02:57.240]  so he's about six five three hundred pounds solid muzzle holds two Barrett's
[1:02:57.240 --> 1:03:02.880]  up like six times but then just has to lower them because it's just it's just
[1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:13.440]  it's just too hard to do but not not good for the spine I am you don't feel at
[1:03:13.440 --> 1:03:18.080]  the time folks it's the next morning look at McAfee we're shooting a tree about
[1:03:18.080 --> 1:03:23.520]  200 yards away handheld you're watching us on TV you can see that so so that is
[1:03:23.520 --> 1:03:29.360]  that is coming up I'm gonna news blitz through some key top stories when we
[1:03:29.360 --> 1:03:32.680]  come back and then pharmacist Ben Fuchs is gonna go on with us he sent me a
[1:03:32.680 --> 1:03:36.000]  whole folder of breaking stuff he wanted to cover and he had been on a while
[1:03:36.000 --> 1:03:40.040]  we're gonna talk about glyphosate toxicity which I'm really concerned about
[1:03:40.040 --> 1:03:44.000]  major studies are out there about what's doing the water supply cancer being the
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:48.800]  number one killer and why he's got all the documents on that we're gonna get
[1:03:48.800 --> 1:03:53.560]  into new study shows Paxil may promote breast cancer that's been well known for
[1:03:53.560 --> 1:03:57.480]  a long time but that's in the LA Times he's got like eight big points he wanted
[1:03:57.480 --> 1:04:03.720]  to cover so I said please please come on pharmacist Ben Fuchs who hosts the
[1:04:03.720 --> 1:04:09.720]  bright side here on GCN radio GCN live com the network that has lovingly carried
[1:04:09.720 --> 1:04:15.240]  my broadcast now for 16 plus 16 plus years of syndication I guess it's
[1:04:15.240 --> 1:04:20.240]  1998 when they took over my little syndication so that is 16 years I've
[1:04:20.240 --> 1:04:25.560]  been syndicated for 17 plus years hard to believe I've been on air 19 years and
[1:04:25.560 --> 1:04:33.840]  that syndicated within two years that is I guess Providence I don't know but
[1:04:33.840 --> 1:04:39.000]  we're here and we appreciate all of you out there ladies and gentlemen earlier
[1:04:39.000 --> 1:04:42.880]  look like a those old soap operas where they're all you know have ten doctors
[1:04:42.880 --> 1:04:48.160]  around somebody so chair clan scalpel they were in there trying to get the
[1:04:48.160 --> 1:04:50.160]  press conference I'm like I don't think I even want to air the police chief's
[1:04:50.160 --> 1:04:53.680]  press conference I was just wanting to see if they said the guy's name have they
[1:04:53.680 --> 1:04:57.880]  still not said the suspect's name in the car crash at South by Southwest with the
[1:04:57.880 --> 1:05:04.000]  psycho driver the facts are in the studies are legion sodium fluoride and

[1:08:35.280 --> 1:08:40.640]  story out there in mainstream news the car crash in austin texas where a parent
[1:08:40.640 --> 1:08:44.240]  madman ran from police down the wrong way streets running over crowds of
[1:08:44.240 --> 1:08:49.880]  people killing at least two injuring 23 doctors say three more two more might
[1:08:49.880 --> 1:08:53.400]  die that is an important story but not as important as world war three could
[1:08:53.400 --> 1:08:57.520]  happen and still the missing plane everybody loves a mystery the tragic
[1:08:57.520 --> 1:09:01.720]  missing plane the malaysian airlines they thought there was something seen by

[1:09:10.720 --> 1:09:18.880]  board in eight 1983 flight 007 can't make that stuff up also there's a new
[1:09:18.880 --> 1:09:23.080]  military commission saying no compelling medical reason exclude trannies from the
[1:09:23.080 --> 1:09:27.240]  military that's right world war three possibly happening is not important the
[1:09:27.240 --> 1:09:30.520]  global derivatives market being a fraud's not important the key is we've
[1:09:30.520 --> 1:09:36.520]  got to have tranny commandos cc that's the new civil right is that we have
[1:09:36.520 --> 1:09:40.040]  special bathrooms put in everywhere for the trannies and that we get rid of the
[1:09:40.040 --> 1:09:46.040]  sexes so that they can engage in depopulation it doesn't matter if
[1:09:46.040 --> 1:09:49.360]  hillary's a liar about Benghazi and a criminal she has a girlfriend so if
[1:09:49.360 --> 1:09:52.600]  you're against her and a girlfriend you're bigoted you have to support
[1:09:52.600 --> 1:09:56.000]  everything hillary wants and let her raise your taxes or you're against her
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:10:00.040]  and her girlfriend no i don't want to think about her and a girlfriend i will
[1:10:00.040 --> 1:10:06.400]  assure you i will assure you i'm sick of cnn and how she's a glamour model and
[1:10:06.400 --> 1:10:12.560]  how wonderful hillary is force-feeding you know me this garbage also red light
[1:10:12.560 --> 1:10:16.360]  cameras are ticketing people seeking emergency help at the er box news is
[1:10:16.360 --> 1:10:19.920]  reporting authorities have installed red light cameras near emergency
[1:10:19.920 --> 1:10:27.200]  remittances at university hospital in tamarka to nail traffic violators but
[1:10:27.200 --> 1:10:30.600]  those rushing to the facility for medical attention are getting in snarled
[1:10:30.600 --> 1:10:35.000]  well of course they've caught cities all over the country and states putting in
[1:10:35.000 --> 1:10:41.120]  red light cameras and then lowering the yellow lights from four seconds down to
[1:10:41.120 --> 1:10:46.320]  three down to two so that you get caught out in the intersection and there's no
[1:10:46.320 --> 1:10:50.880]  way to get across and they'll go and one thing i saw in houston from years ago
[1:10:50.880 --> 1:10:54.640]  from five million a year with one red light camera to 20 million with one
[1:10:54.640 --> 1:10:58.360]  camera because basically almost everyone ends up getting tickets it's just
[1:10:58.360 --> 1:11:03.320]  flash flash flash flash flash flash flash flash flash flash flash flash you come
[1:11:03.320 --> 1:11:10.400]  up it turns yellow you stop even back up they still get you it doesn't matter it
[1:11:10.400 --> 1:11:14.680]  massively increases racks that's on record doesn't matter gotta make money for
[1:11:14.680 --> 1:11:20.200]  the parasitic system major quake threat lurks off california's northern coast
[1:11:20.200 --> 1:11:24.600]  they're reporting that's an interesting report from the la times ball places a
[1:11:24.600 --> 1:11:27.800]  potential threat of major earthquake of california's northern coast risk of
[1:11:27.800 --> 1:11:32.280]  monster quake and tsunami of california's northern coast is greater than
[1:11:32.280 --> 1:11:36.440]  researchers once thought but i tell you in this new study what that is important
[1:11:36.440 --> 1:11:42.120]  the question is do they have tranny sections on the emergency live boats if
[1:11:42.120 --> 1:11:45.880]  there's a tsunami that is the question is that
[1:11:45.880 --> 1:11:50.440]  is there a tranny section i think of a meteorite was coming that was 20 miles
[1:11:50.440 --> 1:11:55.160]  long destroy human life the question is would the spaceship they launch with
[1:11:55.160 --> 1:11:59.960]  nuclear missiles to take out the the the the the
[1:11:59.960 --> 1:12:05.240]  the comet coming in to hit the earth would it be piloted by trannies
[1:12:05.240 --> 1:12:09.400]  because you've got to have diversity on the spaceship going to stop the comet
[1:12:09.400 --> 1:12:14.040]  and i agree with that in fact they should all be trannies
[1:12:14.040 --> 1:12:20.200]  on board in the spaceships i'm not kidding folks to prove we're not
[1:12:20.200 --> 1:12:24.360]  racist okay let's continuing if a 9.0 earthquake were to
[1:12:24.360 --> 1:12:28.120]  strike off california's sparsely populated north coast it would have a
[1:12:28.120 --> 1:12:33.080]  catastrophic ripple effect a giant tsunami created by a quake
[1:12:33.080 --> 1:12:37.080]  would wash away coastal towns destroy us 101 and cause 70
[1:12:37.080 --> 1:12:40.760]  million in damage over a large swath the pacific coast more than 100 bridges
[1:12:40.760 --> 1:12:42.920]  would be lost power lines toppled in coastal
[1:12:42.920 --> 1:12:48.760]  towns isolated residents would have a she was 15 minutes to flee man they
[1:12:48.760 --> 1:12:53.080]  would only hit los angeles to higher ground i'm just joking folks as many
[1:12:53.080 --> 1:12:57.640]  as 10 000 would perish scientists last year published the
[1:12:57.640 --> 1:13:01.880]  grim scenario for a massive rupture along the cascade fault
[1:13:01.880 --> 1:13:05.400]  system which runs 700 miles off the coast of the northern california to
[1:13:05.400 --> 1:13:09.080]  vancouver island there's a graphic on the article about
[1:13:09.080 --> 1:13:12.840]  what the devastating quake would look like if we click on that graphic right
[1:13:12.840 --> 1:13:16.200]  there and it just goes through it all but i mean
[1:13:16.200 --> 1:13:19.160]  this is what's always been happening on this planet
[1:13:19.160 --> 1:13:23.640]  always what's been going on it's part of life the mega volcanoes due to erupt
[1:13:23.640 --> 1:13:27.880]  that's the size of uh well it's close to the size of
[1:13:27.880 --> 1:13:30.760]  a third of colorada but it but it straddles four states it's right in
[1:13:30.760 --> 1:13:33.800]  the middle of four corners there i guess they call it
[1:13:33.800 --> 1:13:37.400]  and uh man if it blows i mean they say it could kill all human life on earth
[1:13:37.400 --> 1:13:41.640]  i wonder if a carbon tax would fix it if i may be paid alcohol or money
[1:13:41.640 --> 1:13:46.280]  he could build a giant temple to himself uh the meaning maybe that he would
[1:13:46.280 --> 1:13:50.760]  weigh the magic wand and protect me but the point is we can't really control
[1:13:50.760 --> 1:13:54.920]  any of those things we were just talking about what we can deal with is what's
[1:13:54.920 --> 1:13:58.520]  happening in our food system what's happening in our
[1:13:58.520 --> 1:14:02.840]  environment what's going on in our society and joining us for the next

[1:16:35.560 --> 1:16:38.600]  controls where we can control and where we can control
[1:16:38.600 --> 1:16:42.200]  is in terms of the food we're eating the water we're drinking what we're putting
[1:16:42.200 --> 1:16:45.480]  into our body via supplements and i want to commend you for really taking the
[1:16:45.480 --> 1:16:48.040]  bull by the horns in this whole issue with your supplements and
[1:16:48.040 --> 1:16:52.520]  really participating in diving in full force into the idea of using
[1:16:52.520 --> 1:16:55.720]  supplements and taking care of your body from a physical perspective so that you
[1:16:55.720 --> 1:16:58.840]  can fight the new world order on a psychological and a mental
[1:16:58.840 --> 1:17:02.280]  oh i mean i mean what you've helped me do and what others have done like
[1:17:02.280 --> 1:17:06.360]  like uh ben figs who i know you know and all those folks it is just it is

[1:17:11.320 --> 1:17:14.760]  yeah because there's so many things we can do you know it's really easy because
[1:17:14.760 --> 1:17:17.880]  it's in our face all the horrible things that are going on in terms of the new
[1:17:17.880 --> 1:17:21.160]  world order and and our corrupt political system our corrupt
[1:17:21.160 --> 1:17:25.080]  governmental system obama care etc it's really easy to forget that we do have
[1:17:25.080 --> 1:17:29.160]  a certain element of control and that is where using nutritional supplements
[1:17:29.160 --> 1:17:32.360]  comes in and that's where making better food choices comes in and that's where
[1:17:32.360 --> 1:17:35.480]  not participating as i've said so many times not participating in the
[1:17:35.480 --> 1:17:38.360]  corporate swill in eating the food they want us to
[1:17:38.360 --> 1:17:41.560]  eat drinking the drinks they want us to eat taking the drugs they want us to
[1:17:41.560 --> 1:17:44.040]  take but it's not just to say i'm not going to eat the food and drink the
[1:17:44.040 --> 1:17:47.080]  water and take the drugs you got to figure out a way to be proactive and
[1:17:47.080 --> 1:17:50.360]  that's where water filtration comes in your point is so well taken
[1:17:50.360 --> 1:17:54.760]  we are we are our bodies are 60 to 70 percent water and if you're drinking
[1:17:54.760 --> 1:17:59.640]  toxic trashed out fluoride ridden chloride chlorine filled water not to
[1:17:59.640 --> 1:18:05.160]  mention all the the pesticides that go into water and turtles die in tap water
[1:18:05.160 --> 1:18:08.520]  and not only that they're becoming feminized they're becoming
[1:18:08.520 --> 1:18:11.080]  their sexuality is disappearing that's a whole

[1:18:18.680 --> 1:18:22.280]  even about that it's that it's being unnaturally done
[1:18:22.280 --> 1:18:25.800]  it's happening to the animals and you know there are frogs that are being
[1:18:25.800 --> 1:18:29.160]  there being born with multiple as you say with multiple
[1:18:29.160 --> 1:18:33.560]  multiple genders or with no gender infertility in animals as an epidemic
[1:18:33.560 --> 1:18:36.440]  and infertility in the human race is an epidemic as well
[1:18:36.440 --> 1:18:39.320]  why partially because of all the estrogenic
[1:18:39.320 --> 1:18:42.600]  gender bending the gender bending chemicals that are put in the water
[1:18:42.600 --> 1:18:46.040]  you know glycol the roundup the glycophos that is
[1:18:46.040 --> 1:18:49.880]  that's a toxin for sure that'll kill you for sure but even worse
[1:18:49.880 --> 1:18:54.200]  it messes up your endocrine system it messes up your man's ability to be a
[1:18:54.200 --> 1:18:58.520]  man a woman's ability to be a woman and the ability of the two to meet and
[1:18:58.520 --> 1:19:02.280]  form babies to conceive this is why infertility is so it's such a big
[1:19:02.280 --> 1:19:05.400]  problem this is why sperm counts are dropping this is why
[1:19:05.400 --> 1:19:09.000]  people just can't get pregnant it's like the human race is dying
[1:19:09.000 --> 1:19:13.160]  because of this what are we thinking what is the government thinking what is it
[1:19:13.160 --> 1:19:16.920]  you know government the government officials new world order proponents
[1:19:16.920 --> 1:19:19.880]  still have to drink the water they still got to drink the air
[1:19:19.880 --> 1:19:23.400]  breathe the air what is what are these people thinking they're killing

[1:24:14.840 --> 1:24:18.440]  on the next segment this short segment i want to get right back
[1:24:18.440 --> 1:24:23.720]  into what he was starting to get into what is in the food what is in the water
[1:24:23.720 --> 1:24:31.080]  what is going on uh and the fact that no fish no frogs no
[1:24:31.080 --> 1:24:35.720]  turtles will live in tap water that you drink and they call it a cost benefit
[1:24:35.720 --> 1:24:38.600]  analysis to clean the water in our mass civilization
[1:24:38.600 --> 1:24:41.400]  that they know in the statistics they've known since the fifties
[1:24:41.400 --> 1:24:44.760]  it's going to increase bladder cancer kidney cancer and it's true we didn't
[1:24:44.760 --> 1:24:47.400]  have clean water which is always a problem for civilization
[1:24:47.400 --> 1:24:50.840]  that would cause even more deaths he lived to be probably 35 on average
[1:24:50.840 --> 1:24:54.040]  and the advent of clean water and things by the 20s and 30s and the statistics
[1:24:54.040 --> 1:24:57.560]  are clear made disease go way down vaccines came in the 40s
[1:24:57.560 --> 1:25:00.840]  you can look at these graphs worldwide and disease actually went back up a
[1:25:00.840 --> 1:25:04.440]  little bit but not to previous levels but i digress with pharmacist ben fuchs
[1:25:04.440 --> 1:25:08.840]  alex jones here back live the big issue is the glyphosate
[1:25:08.840 --> 1:25:12.840]  roundup and this for me the more i study is even
[1:25:12.840 --> 1:25:17.080]  worse than fluoride and the real reason now that i will not
[1:25:17.080 --> 1:25:19.720]  drink anything that's had tap water because i used to go to restaurants that
[1:25:19.720 --> 1:25:24.520]  still drink it and still get xt i new radically will not do it now
[1:25:24.520 --> 1:25:27.160]  i will new radically not do it i'm seeing more and more restaurants because
[1:25:27.160 --> 1:25:30.520]  folks won't do this i'm seeing more and more restaurants
[1:25:30.520 --> 1:25:34.040]  who are saying we have filtered water we have fluoride free water because folks
[1:25:34.040 --> 1:25:36.360]  want it so i think restaurants should have a sign
[1:25:36.360 --> 1:25:41.400]  and and just say hey we filter our water uh and i would go there like hop
[1:25:41.400 --> 1:25:44.120]  doddies hamburgers here in town pharmacist ben fuchs let's get into
[1:25:44.120 --> 1:25:47.640]  your points because you sent me i guess you sent me eight of them let's
[1:25:47.640 --> 1:25:51.560]  know nine of them but let's run through the nine stories you want to cover
[1:25:51.560 --> 1:25:55.320]  well first of all let's talk about the glyphosate the glycophos the
[1:25:55.320 --> 1:25:58.760]  the glyphosate the roundup hold the round whole roundup issue you know
[1:25:58.760 --> 1:26:02.040]  your point is so important fluoride is bad stuff clearly
[1:26:02.040 --> 1:26:05.240]  but it's an element on the periodic table and there's some fluoride in your
[1:26:05.240 --> 1:26:08.120]  body there's some role not necessarily for the kind of
[1:26:08.120 --> 1:26:10.760]  fluoride they use but at least you can make a case for the fact that the
[1:26:10.760 --> 1:26:13.960]  fluoride is an element in the body there ain't no pesticides in the body that
[1:26:13.960 --> 1:26:18.120]  is pure 100% deadly poison in addition
[1:26:18.120 --> 1:26:21.160]  alex to the fact that you're killing things it's a pesticide
[1:26:21.160 --> 1:26:24.280]  so when it kills things it's going to kill it kill your probiotics your good
[1:26:24.280 --> 1:26:27.640]  bacteria in your gut that's where the whole issues with gluten intolerance
[1:26:27.640 --> 1:26:31.560]  and digestive issues come in digestive health issues come in when you use
[1:26:31.560 --> 1:26:35.080]  these kinds of pesticide laden vegetables but even more importantly is
[1:26:35.080 --> 1:26:37.720]  the whole estrogen issue you know we talk about gender
[1:26:37.720 --> 1:26:40.600]  bending and birth control this is all because estrogen
[1:26:40.600 --> 1:26:43.880]  because these pesticides which are very similar in chemical structure to
[1:26:43.880 --> 1:26:47.480]  the female hormone or the hormone the biological hormone
[1:26:47.480 --> 1:26:50.600]  estrogen this is why they cause birth control or
[1:26:50.600 --> 1:26:53.720]  infertility your birth control pills are estrogen basically
[1:26:53.720 --> 1:26:57.800]  estrogen will tell the body not to make a baby there's several reasons for that
[1:26:57.800 --> 1:27:01.000]  but most importantly it's because estrogen is
[1:27:01.000 --> 1:27:04.840]  a stress hormone it's a hormone that helps the body
[1:27:04.840 --> 1:27:08.440]  handle stresses so the higher your estrogen levels go
[1:27:08.440 --> 1:27:11.560]  the more insomnia you're going to have the more anxiety you're going to have the
[1:27:11.560 --> 1:27:14.600]  more fear you're going to have the more suppressed your immune system is going
[1:27:14.600 --> 1:27:17.880]  to be the more your cells are going to malfunction the more likely you're
[1:27:17.880 --> 1:27:20.120]  going to be to have fibroid cysts blood clots
[1:27:20.120 --> 1:27:25.880]  hypertension and cancer and this is where these pesticides really wreak havoc
[1:27:25.880 --> 1:27:29.480]  on the human biological system in addition to the fact that they're
[1:27:29.480 --> 1:27:32.920]  gender benders in addition to the fact that they'll keep you from being able
[1:27:32.920 --> 1:27:37.400]  to conceive and cause infertility they will maximize accelerate and amplify
[1:27:37.400 --> 1:27:40.200]  the body's stress response and you know as well as I do
[1:27:40.200 --> 1:27:44.040]  we have an epidemic of anxiety and stress in this country
[1:27:44.040 --> 1:27:48.200]  and it's largely because of chemicals in the water and in the food supply and
[1:27:48.200 --> 1:27:51.560]  by the way we're putting mainline studies up mainstream news this is not
[1:27:51.560 --> 1:27:55.160]  even debated that the anxiety epidemic is glyphosate
[1:27:55.160 --> 1:27:59.720]  it's not even debated that they have these estrogen dependent cancers in the
[1:27:59.720 --> 1:28:02.440]  women and that's why we lead the world in breast cancer
[1:28:02.440 --> 1:28:07.560]  but they're expanding the use of the Monsanto Roundup I mean these people
[1:28:07.560 --> 1:28:11.320]  are literal demons and on top of all of that when a plant
[1:28:11.320 --> 1:28:15.320]  is using when a plant is given pesticides it doesn't have to make its own
[1:28:15.320 --> 1:28:19.320]  natural pesticides plants make their own pesticides you know
[1:28:19.320 --> 1:28:23.960]  and these plant pesticides we call phytonutrients plant nutrients
[1:28:23.960 --> 1:28:28.600]  bioflavonoids and keratines and accessory nutrients that aren't vitamins
[1:28:28.600 --> 1:28:31.000]  and minerals necessarily but are very valuable
[1:28:31.000 --> 1:28:35.080]  for human health well when a plant has pesticides or is given pesticides
[1:28:35.080 --> 1:28:38.600]  it doesn't have to make these substances which function
[1:28:38.600 --> 1:28:42.760]  as natural pesticides and also function as nutrients for us which means the
[1:28:42.760 --> 1:28:46.840]  plants that are given the Roundup will be less healthy
[1:28:46.840 --> 1:28:50.360]  and have less nutritional value than the plants that are used with that are
[1:28:50.360 --> 1:28:54.280]  grown without pesticides this is a a hidden
[1:28:54.280 --> 1:28:57.240]  problem associated with the use of pesticides yeah you can
[1:28:57.240 --> 1:29:00.280]  you can maybe grow plants without having to worry about pests by using Roundup
[1:29:00.280 --> 1:29:03.400]  but you get less valuable plants from a nutritional standpoint
[1:29:03.400 --> 1:29:06.840]  so for so from so many angles from so many perspectives
[1:29:06.840 --> 1:29:10.440]  the use of these toxic materials these these pesticides
[1:29:10.440 --> 1:29:13.720]  like Roundup are destroying the health of humanity
[1:29:13.720 --> 1:29:17.080]  and we can see this everywhere we could see it in breast cancer we could see it
[1:29:17.080 --> 1:29:19.480]  in insomnia we could see it in stress we could see it
[1:29:19.480 --> 1:29:23.560]  in in degenerative diseases and autoimmune diseases we can see it
[1:29:23.560 --> 1:29:27.240]  from every turn so Alex what the heck are we doing to ourselves
[1:29:27.240 --> 1:29:31.880]  what is this new world order this monstrous leviathan doing to humanity
[1:29:31.880 --> 1:29:35.240]  i agree uh incredible question let's break it down we come back long
[1:29:35.240 --> 1:29:38.440]  segment with pharmacist ben fuchs who is on fire today
[1:29:38.440 --> 1:29:42.280]  and i'm on fire to resist this and i'm not perfect but i'm slowly changing my
[1:29:42.280 --> 1:29:45.080]  lifestyle i've probably turned the boat around
[1:29:45.080 --> 1:29:49.080]  60 70 80 degrees and it's and now the boat's turning faster
[1:29:49.080 --> 1:29:53.640]  away from the poison to help empires on the we can all do it together
[1:29:53.640 --> 1:29:58.680]  alex jones and the gcn radio network
[1:29:58.680 --> 1:30:06.040]  in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and
[1:30:06.040 --> 1:30:11.240]  replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around
[1:30:11.240 --> 1:30:14.840]  the world guess what else is in a halogen family fluoride
[1:30:14.840 --> 1:30:19.320]  ladies and gentlemen alex jones here in 1924 the federal government did the
[1:30:19.320 --> 1:30:23.320]  right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine
[1:30:23.320 --> 1:30:27.320]  it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results

[1:33:59.320 --> 1:34:04.040]  mandated iodine in the salt in the 20s and iqs went up more than 10 points
[1:34:04.040 --> 1:34:07.560]  in the next decade that's federal studies you can go to info wars life.com
[1:34:07.560 --> 1:34:11.000]  and check out the survival shield and see videos there that where we show the
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:15.240]  news articles the documents the studies then in the 50s they said you know what
[1:34:15.240 --> 1:34:19.880]  take it out now i'm against forced medication
[1:34:19.880 --> 1:34:23.640]  but that was government doing forced medicating through the salt because
[1:34:23.640 --> 1:34:27.480]  it was all sorts of thyroid problems and iq dropping and the
[1:34:27.480 --> 1:34:31.560]  and deformities in children from not having enough iodine in utero
[1:34:31.560 --> 1:34:35.960]  this is all well known science what do they then add into the
[1:34:35.960 --> 1:34:39.640]  baking powder and all the rest of it the bromine the bromide
[1:34:39.640 --> 1:34:43.880]  which goes into the thyroid i mean it's just it is a conspiracy folks
[1:34:43.880 --> 1:34:46.760]  it is a program and speaking of beyond tangy tangerine
[1:34:46.760 --> 1:34:52.120]  scientific american dirt poor have fruits and vegetables become less
[1:34:52.120 --> 1:34:55.640]  nutritious and then they go into the article saying yes
[1:34:55.640 --> 1:34:58.920]  it's been depleted because you see yet hundreds of different trace elements
[1:34:58.920 --> 1:35:01.800]  and things in the 90 essentials in the soil
[1:35:01.800 --> 1:35:05.240]  now they would the with the different fertilizers put three
[1:35:05.240 --> 1:35:08.600]  different things in there that only the plants need and then you eat that ladies
[1:35:08.600 --> 1:35:11.640]  and gentlemen so this is what's going on and i'm
[1:35:11.640 --> 1:35:15.880]  certainly no health guru myself but anybody can look if we do this video
[1:35:15.880 --> 1:35:20.600]  folks show me two years ago and then show the videos of me on air
[1:35:20.600 --> 1:35:24.280]  now or photos of me two years ago now i mean i look
[1:35:24.280 --> 1:35:28.760]  like job of the hut and i'm still not like some sex symbol or something but
[1:35:28.760 --> 1:35:31.320]  i mean i look a lot better people see me in public may go
[1:35:31.320 --> 1:35:35.240]  alex jones man you you looked you know overweight and unhealthy
[1:35:35.240 --> 1:35:40.040]  just you know a few years ago when i saw you on the street man you look great
[1:35:40.040 --> 1:35:44.200]  compared to what i look like and i'm telling you it's the same exercise i've
[1:35:44.200 --> 1:35:46.600]  been doing exercise again for four or five years trying to get back in shape
[1:35:46.600 --> 1:35:49.320]  but still not eating right and not getting the minerals and stuff the beyond

[1:36:07.560 --> 1:36:12.440]  dr. edward group with the super true nasin iodine that's glycerin based
[1:36:12.440 --> 1:36:15.720]  organic glycerin based from germany we try to get everything from america but
[1:36:15.720 --> 1:36:19.000]  you can't get organic glycerin in america we haven't able to do it yet only
[1:36:19.000 --> 1:36:21.480]  glycerin from germany's only place you get it certified
[1:36:21.480 --> 1:36:26.280]  and it turns blue on paper not black or red like so-called nasin iodine out there
[1:36:26.280 --> 1:36:29.880]  that really isn't nasin iodine from what labs have looked at it and told us
[1:36:29.880 --> 1:36:31.960]  i'm not knocking it you still need it it just
[1:36:31.960 --> 1:36:35.000]  tastes like rocket fuel and doesn't agree with my stomach
[1:36:35.000 --> 1:36:38.760]  this survival shield that we have is proprietary double strength
[1:36:38.760 --> 1:36:42.920]  half the cost of the leading competitor because there's one other company and
[1:36:42.920 --> 1:36:46.040]  that's where we get it from that's nobody even knows who they are that that puts
[1:36:46.040 --> 1:36:49.320]  this out and that's how we bought a contract for years to be exclusive to
[1:36:49.320 --> 1:36:52.920]  put out our brand of it they sell half the size double the cost that's all i can
[1:36:52.920 --> 1:36:56.520]  say double the size half the cost i mean it's it's double the
[1:36:56.520 --> 1:36:59.800]  size the amount info wars life dot com and we

[1:38:19.000 --> 1:38:22.760]  i want you to go through all your points about the glyphosates the fluoride

[1:38:35.800 --> 1:38:38.920]  out pharmacist Ben Fuchs well let's start off with this
[1:38:38.920 --> 1:38:42.280]  a whole idea of epigenetics you know you know i've talked about this a lot
[1:38:42.280 --> 1:38:46.200]  we have this this idea in in science and in medicine that everything comes from
[1:38:46.200 --> 1:38:49.240]  the genes scientists call it the central dogma
[1:38:49.240 --> 1:38:52.840]  you know the word dogma means something that you believe without evidence
[1:38:52.840 --> 1:38:56.680]  religious religions usually have a dogma but science says dogmas too
[1:38:56.680 --> 1:38:59.560]  and one of the major dogmas in science is something called the central dogma
[1:38:59.560 --> 1:39:02.120]  which says that everything comes from genetics
[1:39:02.120 --> 1:39:04.680]  this is in the interest of the pharmaceutical companies because then
[1:39:04.680 --> 1:39:07.560]  they can come out with drugs that manipulate the genetics and indeed
[1:39:07.560 --> 1:39:11.080]  if you read the pharmaceutical trade journals you'll see that this is the
[1:39:11.080 --> 1:39:13.960]  great push in terms of medicine is finding
[1:39:13.960 --> 1:39:17.960]  finding drugs that can actually affect work with changing the genes or
[1:39:17.960 --> 1:39:20.760]  targeting the genes to to target specific
[1:39:20.760 --> 1:39:25.000]  disease states however as it turns out the central dogma is
[1:39:25.000 --> 1:39:28.360]  wrong because there are nutritional factors and lifestyle
[1:39:28.360 --> 1:39:32.200]  factors that turn genes on and off you have i talked about this
[1:39:32.200 --> 1:39:35.240]  a couple of months back when we talked about prophylactic mastectomies
[1:39:35.240 --> 1:39:38.760]  angelina angelina jolly for example had her breast removed because she had a
[1:39:38.760 --> 1:39:43.080]  gene that indicated that she may end up with breast cancer
[1:39:43.080 --> 1:39:46.280]  completely ignoring the fact that that gene that causes
[1:39:46.280 --> 1:39:49.960]  breast cancer to either come on to either occur or not occur
[1:39:49.960 --> 1:39:54.520]  is turned is itself turned on by nutritional factors and lifestyle
[1:39:54.520 --> 1:39:58.360]  factors this whole phenomena is known as epigenetics
[1:39:58.360 --> 1:40:03.320]  epi meaning transcendent to or above so the key to taking care of yourself and
[1:40:03.320 --> 1:40:06.440]  this is so important because what it means is the epi the idea of epigenetics
[1:40:06.440 --> 1:40:09.560]  what it means is we can take care of ourselves
[1:40:09.560 --> 1:40:12.840]  we don't have to worry about our heredity when it comes to
[1:40:12.840 --> 1:40:16.440]  whether you're going to get diabetes or autoimmune disease or god forbid cancer
[1:40:16.440 --> 1:40:20.280]  because epigenetics trumps genetics and that means
[1:40:20.280 --> 1:40:24.040]  that we have a locus of control we can control
[1:40:24.040 --> 1:40:28.440]  our epigenetics to an extent where we can't control our genes directly we can
[1:40:28.440 --> 1:40:31.480]  control our genes in a secondary fashion by working with
[1:40:31.480 --> 1:40:34.840]  nutrients among the most powerful nutritional factors
[1:40:34.840 --> 1:40:39.480]  or achieve their power via epigenetics via turning genes on and off for example
[1:40:39.480 --> 1:40:42.600]  one of my all-time favorite nutrients is selenium
[1:40:42.600 --> 1:40:45.480]  and uh selenium as you and i've talked about in the past
[1:40:45.480 --> 1:40:51.080]  is amazingly anti-cancer selenium is amazingly anti-mercury by the way and
[1:40:51.080 --> 1:40:55.160]  anti-radiation as well and selenium it has particular protection
[1:40:55.160 --> 1:40:58.760]  against breast cancer and estrogenic diseases as well so if you're concerned
[1:40:58.760 --> 1:41:02.440]  about glyc about roundup and glyphosates and
[1:41:02.440 --> 1:41:05.480]  pesticides and gender bending and estrogenic
[1:41:05.480 --> 1:41:09.080]  chemicals in the water and in the air it becomes imperative
[1:41:09.080 --> 1:41:12.920]  that you use these nutrients that manipulate the body epigenetically
[1:41:12.920 --> 1:41:16.520]  like selenium selenium of course is in many of the longevity products including
[1:41:16.520 --> 1:41:19.400]  the beyond tany tangerine as well as the ultimate selenium
[1:41:19.400 --> 1:41:23.080]  and i noticed by the way that your fluoride shield the fluoride shield has
[1:41:23.080 --> 1:41:25.800]  got a really neat ingredient called shilajit
[1:41:25.800 --> 1:41:30.520]  shilajit is kind of a tarry resin mineral ingredient that grows in it that
[1:41:30.520 --> 1:41:35.400]  is found in the Himalayas and shilajit also is very high in selenium as well
[1:41:35.400 --> 1:41:37.560]  so using the fluoride shield is much more than a
[1:41:37.560 --> 1:41:40.280]  de-tie if i could give you a plug for the fluoride shield it's much more than a
[1:41:40.280 --> 1:41:44.680]  detox for fluoride it's a detox for pesticides and all kinds of toxins
[1:41:44.680 --> 1:41:48.120]  the second thing i want to talk about is probiotics there's some literature out
[1:41:48.120 --> 1:41:53.160]  that's indicating there that's that's alluding to the fact that probiotics
[1:41:53.160 --> 1:41:57.320]  might be a scam and indeed the way probiotics are being marketed
[1:41:57.320 --> 1:42:00.440]  like jamie lee kurtis and by dan and yogurd and by
[1:42:00.440 --> 1:42:05.160]  uh corporate marketers and the corporateocracy
[1:42:05.160 --> 1:42:08.360]  they might be a scam but a good probiotic supplement
[1:42:08.360 --> 1:42:13.000]  is not optional it is a fundamental part of life and even though probiotics are
[1:42:13.000 --> 1:42:16.520]  not considered to be essential nutrients in terms of the 90 essential
[1:42:16.520 --> 1:42:20.280]  nutrients there are unbelievable importance for good
[1:42:20.280 --> 1:42:24.040]  health it cannot be under as cannot be overestimated for
[1:42:24.040 --> 1:42:28.360]  example probiotics are one of the key nutritional factors that are involved
[1:42:28.360 --> 1:42:31.800]  in detoxifying the body of estrogen and estrogen
[1:42:31.800 --> 1:42:35.080]  estrogen breakdown products that are associated with cancer
[1:42:35.080 --> 1:42:38.760]  in fact anybody who is even remotely concerned
[1:42:38.760 --> 1:42:42.680]  about breast cancer or reproductive cancers or prostate cancer
[1:42:42.680 --> 1:42:47.880]  or testicular cancer or if a woman is concerned about fibroids or cysts or
[1:42:47.880 --> 1:42:51.480]  if women can't conceive all of these are linked to problems with estrogen
[1:42:51.480 --> 1:42:55.640]  metabolites using a probiotic is one of the great and
[1:42:55.640 --> 1:42:59.720]  underappreciated nutritional strategies for protecting yourself from estrogen
[1:42:59.720 --> 1:43:02.520]  but when you're using a probiotic supplement you got to be careful
[1:43:02.520 --> 1:43:06.280]  you can't use jamie lee kurtis and and dan and yogurd nutritional
[1:43:06.280 --> 1:43:09.960]  uh nutritional strategies and nutritional products you've got to use a
[1:43:09.960 --> 1:43:15.080]  broad spectrum probiotic one that has multiple strains of bacteria 12
[1:43:15.080 --> 1:43:18.680]  14 15 different strains of bacteria and one that has
[1:43:18.680 --> 1:43:22.440]  lots of different billions of units of bacteria in the order of
[1:43:22.440 --> 1:43:25.560]  10 or 15 or 20 billion units of bacteria in addition to
[1:43:25.560 --> 1:43:28.600]  eating fermented food things like kefir and miso
[1:43:28.600 --> 1:43:32.360]  tempeh kimchi anything fermented is going to provide you with probiotics
[1:43:32.360 --> 1:43:37.160]  in addition to probiotics helping you process toxin S toxic estrogen
[1:43:37.160 --> 1:43:40.760]  probiotics help you process cholesterol they help you process blood fats
[1:43:40.760 --> 1:43:43.960]  probiotics make vitamins like the b vitamins for example
[1:43:43.960 --> 1:43:48.120]  are produced by good bacteria these probiotics by the way are supposed to be
[1:43:48.120 --> 1:43:52.760]  implanted in our gut as we pass through the birth canal but we know today 30
[1:43:52.760 --> 1:43:57.000]  percent of babies are born caesarean if you're born caesarean or your baby was
[1:43:57.000 --> 1:44:00.520]  born caesarean it becomes extra important that they focus on
[1:44:00.520 --> 1:44:03.800]  getting a good you focus on getting a good probiotic supplement
[1:44:03.800 --> 1:44:08.760]  as well as eating fermented foods if a baby was not breastfed long enough this
[1:44:08.760 --> 1:44:12.360]  can have a negative impact on probiotics also if you have if your baby
[1:44:12.360 --> 1:44:15.640]  wasn't breastfed long enough your baby wasn't breastfed at all you may notice
[1:44:15.640 --> 1:44:18.840]  that your baby is colicky colicky comes from the word
[1:44:18.840 --> 1:44:22.840]  colon this is why babies get colicky is because they have colon issues
[1:44:22.840 --> 1:44:26.120]  colon issues are almost always associated with problems with probiotics so
[1:44:26.120 --> 1:44:29.560]  if you have a baby that has eczema if you have a baby that has pimples or
[1:44:29.560 --> 1:44:32.920]  breakouts if you have a baby that's colicky or has constipation all of
[1:44:32.920 --> 1:44:37.960]  these are very common uh in babies get that baby my grandmother
[1:44:37.960 --> 1:44:42.120]  i know i'm interrupting but my grandmother kept my father so clean her
[1:44:42.120 --> 1:44:47.560]  firstborn that the black nanny he was getting sick a lot
[1:44:47.560 --> 1:44:51.480]  and having colic and things and by the time he was like two
[1:44:51.480 --> 1:44:54.760]  she said listen you know david's gonna die to
[1:44:54.760 --> 1:44:58.360]  quote her you know david's gonna you end up getting sick and dying if you don't
[1:44:58.360 --> 1:45:02.280]  give him hindu tea and she snuck later in a minute he got
[1:45:02.280 --> 1:45:05.640]  really healthy and it was basically a probiotic of boiled
[1:45:05.640 --> 1:45:09.640]  chicken crap and he basically didn't get sick after she started giving him boiled
[1:45:09.640 --> 1:45:12.920]  chicken crap yeah which which is what i mean imagine
[1:45:12.920 --> 1:45:16.040]  blacks coming from slavery and all that they had to have their own medicine they
[1:45:16.040 --> 1:45:19.000]  knew what to do well there's the same thing right there
[1:45:19.000 --> 1:45:22.120]  manure has been highly prized for centuries until we got the
[1:45:22.120 --> 1:45:26.040]  the npk fertilizers manure was been incredibly prized
[1:45:26.040 --> 1:45:29.880]  precious commodity was manure manure is is loaded with all kinds of
[1:45:29.880 --> 1:45:34.920]  important bacteria uh good bacteria for for uh for growing plants and yeah and
[1:45:34.920 --> 1:45:37.240]  she had to sneak and give it to him
[1:45:37.240 --> 1:45:40.920]  yeah so you know the old a lot of times the old time remedies
[1:45:40.920 --> 1:45:43.960]  they trump the new time remedies and the pharmaceutical remedies
[1:45:43.960 --> 1:45:48.280]  a lot of the times all right so anyway i want to talk also about ssri's
[1:45:48.280 --> 1:45:50.920]  a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors you know we talked
[1:45:50.920 --> 1:45:55.720]  earlier about how estrogens are anxiety promoting stress management hormones
[1:45:55.720 --> 1:46:00.120]  well guess what a lot of folks don't realize serotonin is the same way we
[1:46:00.120 --> 1:46:03.720]  have been flooded with misinformation about serotonin
[1:46:03.720 --> 1:46:07.640]  being a happy hormone and being a hormone that helps improve your mood etc
[1:46:07.640 --> 1:46:10.680]  everybody wants to make sure that their serotonin levels are high
[1:46:10.680 --> 1:46:15.880]  serotonin is like estrogen a stress management hormone it is a vigilance
[1:46:15.880 --> 1:46:18.440]  hormone it's an alertness hormone and yes it's
[1:46:18.440 --> 1:46:21.640]  important it's clearly important but what it's important for is helping the
[1:46:21.640 --> 1:46:24.600]  body handle the ups and downs the vicissitudes the
[1:46:24.600 --> 1:46:28.120]  survival threats that are part of being alive and you need to have a certain
[1:46:28.120 --> 1:46:32.360]  amount of serotonin however you do not want to poison your serotonin
[1:46:32.360 --> 1:46:36.360]  metabolizing system to the point where you have too much serotonin when you
[1:46:36.360 --> 1:46:39.560]  have elevations in serotonin that's what the serotonin reuptake
[1:46:39.560 --> 1:46:42.440]  inhibitors do they keep serotonin levels super high
[1:46:42.440 --> 1:46:46.840]  artificially high you end up with this provigilant state
[1:46:46.840 --> 1:46:51.240]  with this almost paranoia state and what happens when people take the prozacs
[1:46:51.240 --> 1:46:54.360]  and the zoloss and the serotonin reuptake inhibitors what can happen
[1:46:54.360 --> 1:46:58.280]  is that they can become paranoid and that's why you have almost everybody
[1:46:58.280 --> 1:47:01.960]  almost almost all the people who are doing these school shootings and the
[1:47:01.960 --> 1:47:05.080]  psychiatrists and the navy psychiatrist who was doing this
[1:47:05.080 --> 1:47:09.400]  who shot up the navy base and people doing these crazy
[1:47:09.400 --> 1:47:12.360]  mass murder kinds of things almost invariably
[1:47:12.360 --> 1:47:15.640]  there on a serotonin reuptake inhibitor alex
[1:47:15.640 --> 1:47:19.720]  it's like a direct link between between mass murder
[1:47:19.720 --> 1:47:25.000]  mass murders and and serotonin when we heard in austin than a guy like a
[1:47:25.000 --> 1:47:29.000]  zombie had just shot a cop for no reason in walmart i said he's going to be on
[1:47:29.000 --> 1:47:32.760]  those drugs and you know what it was yes it's almost always alex you can
[1:47:32.760 --> 1:47:36.040]  almost assume that when there's some ridiculous mass
[1:47:36.040 --> 1:47:39.400]  murder school shooting crazy out of control behavior
[1:47:39.400 --> 1:47:43.160]  that resting behind it is some kind of serotonin reuptake inhibitor what it
[1:47:43.160 --> 1:47:48.920]  underscores is the craziness the utter stupidity the illogical
[1:47:48.920 --> 1:47:52.920]  nature of using pharmacological therapy to deal with
[1:47:52.920 --> 1:47:57.000]  psychological issues to deal with physiological issues that are associated
[1:47:57.000 --> 1:47:59.560]  with poisons and toxins and lack of nutrition
[1:47:59.560 --> 1:48:03.400]  we've got this pharmacomedical model that does
[1:48:03.400 --> 1:48:06.840]  not serve us we've got this pharmacomedical model
[1:48:06.840 --> 1:48:10.840]  that enriches drug companies that enriches the proponents of the medical model
[1:48:10.840 --> 1:48:15.000]  it enriches the insurance companies and and speaking of the insurance companies
[1:48:15.000 --> 1:48:18.600]  and the drug companies being enriched what do you think obama care is about
[1:48:18.600 --> 1:48:24.520]  people do you think obama care is in any way shape or form about taking care of
[1:48:24.520 --> 1:48:28.920]  your health with the exception of perhaps major medical and traumatic
[1:48:28.920 --> 1:48:33.560]  traumatic uh... surga heroic medicine helping heal from it's openly about
[1:48:33.560 --> 1:48:36.920]  turning all the drugs rather than medicine or real diagnosis
[1:48:36.920 --> 1:48:40.360]  and it's about death panels and it's about doubling and tripling prices for
[1:48:40.360 --> 1:48:43.400]  insurance companies it is big pharma taking over
[1:48:43.400 --> 1:48:48.440]  that's right and it's a redistribution of monies it's a redistribution of wealth
[1:48:48.440 --> 1:48:53.560]  in the classics a classic example of taking money from the people and
[1:48:53.560 --> 1:48:57.000]  concentrating it into this ola into this corporate
[1:48:57.000 --> 1:49:00.280]  talk racy this oligarchy that's made up of elites
[1:49:00.280 --> 1:49:04.040]  and we as human beings and we as people and we as citizens
[1:49:04.040 --> 1:49:07.400]  have to do something to begin to participate in our own
[1:49:07.400 --> 1:49:11.400]  health care we cannot depend on the government to do it for us
[1:49:11.400 --> 1:49:15.240]  we cannot depend on government mandated or government funded or government
[1:49:15.240 --> 1:49:17.960]  authorized insurance companies and a government authorized
[1:49:17.960 --> 1:49:22.120]  medical model to do it and this is where nutritional supplementation comes in
[1:49:22.120 --> 1:49:25.960]  this is where lifestyle choices come in this is where not participating in
[1:49:25.960 --> 1:49:29.400]  eating in the corporates eating the corporate soil comes in
[1:49:29.400 --> 1:49:32.440]  especially when it comes to developing minds and developing
[1:49:32.440 --> 1:49:37.480]  developing bodies like our our children if it's important for us as adults to
[1:49:37.480 --> 1:49:41.880]  drive past not drive through it's extra important and while it's easy to
[1:49:41.880 --> 1:49:45.640]  be glib about not going to mcdonald's and not eating the fast food and not
[1:49:45.640 --> 1:49:50.920]  eating the drink in the soda pop etc it's difficult to use will power to do it
[1:49:50.920 --> 1:49:54.200]  because these people who create these kinds of foods
[1:49:54.200 --> 1:49:58.360]  they're smart they're really smart they got phd's
[1:49:58.360 --> 1:50:02.280]  in understanding how to manipulate the human brain to get it to do what it
[1:50:02.280 --> 1:50:04.840]  needs to to get it to do what they want it to do
[1:50:04.840 --> 1:50:07.960]  so what you have to do is you have to protect yourself
[1:50:07.960 --> 1:50:11.080]  against these kinds of foods and against these kinds of messages
[1:50:11.080 --> 1:50:15.400]  and the key the ultimate strategy to protecting yourself from these kinds of
[1:50:15.400 --> 1:50:19.240]  messages and these kinds of foods to to weaning yourself away from the
[1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:22.120]  corporate soil without using willpower which is difficult to do
[1:50:22.120 --> 1:50:26.200]  is to get yourself on a nutritional supplement program i know i've been

[1:56:42.600 --> 1:56:45.960]  because i don't know how people can do that to other people i don't know how
[1:56:45.960 --> 1:56:49.000]  anybody can live with themselves understanding that they're poisoning
[1:56:49.000 --> 1:56:52.040]  their fellow man i don't know how people can live with themselves
[1:56:52.040 --> 1:56:55.560]  knowing that they're using prescription drugs when people are sick and starving
[1:56:55.560 --> 1:56:59.160]  from lack of nutrition and lack of food you know i did you probably saw this
[1:56:59.160 --> 1:57:02.440]  article that was uh all over the news about the kid who couldn't get his drugs
[1:57:02.440 --> 1:57:06.280]  and now all of a sudden the government or the drug companies have decided to
[1:57:06.280 --> 1:57:09.800]  let the child the poor baby have his drugs have you heard about that oh yes
[1:57:09.800 --> 1:57:14.280]  everyone's clamoring after christmas toy right exactly there's this messaging
[1:57:14.280 --> 1:57:18.440]  that's put out that drugs are going to save us
[1:57:18.440 --> 1:57:22.040]  that the government and the pharmacomodern medical model the government
[1:57:22.040 --> 1:57:24.920]  authorized pharmacomedical medical model is our saviors
[1:57:24.920 --> 1:57:28.600]  and i'm telling you this as a healthcare professional as somebody who's been
[1:57:28.600 --> 1:57:31.000]  studying medicine now for pushing 30 years
[1:57:31.000 --> 1:57:35.960]  this is not how the body works and it's not that complicated the human body
[1:57:35.960 --> 1:57:39.560]  needs water it needs food and it needs oxygen
[1:57:39.560 --> 1:57:42.280]  and it needs to have an ability to clear its poisons out
[1:57:42.280 --> 1:57:46.520]  and that's pretty much it folks there's no doctors that are required there's no
[1:57:46.520 --> 1:57:50.520]  drugs that can do anything about it but the good news is is we can take care of
[1:57:50.520 --> 1:57:53.160]  it ourselves by getting on a good nutritional supplement
[1:57:53.160 --> 1:57:56.200]  program by making sure we're eating a lot less food
[1:57:56.200 --> 1:57:59.880]  and we're not participating in in the corporate swell as i've been saying
[1:57:59.880 --> 1:58:02.840]  making sure you're doing something as simple as deep breathing
[1:58:02.840 --> 1:58:05.880]  making sure that you're doing something as simply as simple as
[1:58:05.880 --> 1:58:10.760]  oxygenating and blowing carbon dioxide out deep breathing clean water moderate
[1:58:10.760 --> 1:58:14.360]  exercise it's not that hard it's not that complicated and you
[1:58:14.360 --> 1:58:17.560]  don't need obama care and we don't need a nanny state
[1:58:17.560 --> 1:58:20.920]  infantilizing us and telling us that they know what's best for us

[2:00:40.680 --> 2:00:44.120]  that is all coming up in the next segment but pharmacist has been fused
[2:00:44.120 --> 2:00:48.120]  the latest march issue of info wars magazine that by the way we sell at cost
[2:00:48.120 --> 2:00:51.320]  has john wane on the cover and it says the war on men
[2:00:51.320 --> 2:00:56.280]  and i mean it's just undoubted now uh they're saying just the classical male
[2:00:56.280 --> 2:01:02.600]  model is racist anti-woman uh being a man is bad we've got to eradicate
[2:01:02.600 --> 2:01:05.640]  masculinity why does the establishment want to do that
[2:01:05.640 --> 2:01:09.720]  let me tell you why testosterone male hormones are not just for men they're
[2:01:09.720 --> 2:01:14.520]  building hormones they're strength hormones they're vitality hormones they're
[2:01:14.520 --> 2:01:18.360]  anti-aging hormones they're growth and repair hormones
[2:01:18.360 --> 2:01:21.880]  we are supposed to be like lions alex and testosterone
[2:01:21.880 --> 2:01:25.800]  is the hormone of lions instead of lions we've become like
[2:01:25.800 --> 2:01:31.560]  like like puffer fish we become sloth we that's what we become we're not
[2:01:31.560 --> 2:01:35.560]  lean mean fighting machines we're like big fat gorillas in the zoo that are
[2:01:35.560 --> 2:01:39.640]  how that have big bellies and and big breasts
[2:01:39.640 --> 2:01:43.640]  males i'm talking about the reason the reason this we have this war on men is
[2:01:43.640 --> 2:01:46.280]  not so much a war on men as much as it's a war on
[2:01:46.280 --> 2:01:50.280]  anabolism anabolism is the fancy word for building
[2:01:50.280 --> 2:01:54.040]  and growth and repair war on vigor it's a war on vigor
[2:01:54.040 --> 2:01:57.240]  exactly we become domesticated instead of being
[2:01:57.240 --> 2:02:01.800]  being lions in the in the jungle we're like big fat tatties like hyenas they
[2:02:01.800 --> 2:02:04.360]  say is the only animal that has testosterone
[2:02:04.360 --> 2:02:07.880]  in the milk oh is that right i didn't know that i could see why
[2:02:07.880 --> 2:02:12.200]  testosterone is the hormone of vigor and strength so as as much as it's a
[2:02:12.200 --> 2:02:15.000]  hormone as much as there's a war on against masculinity
[2:02:15.000 --> 2:02:19.160]  it's really a war on our vigor and on our strength
[2:02:19.160 --> 2:02:24.040]  and on i believe our ability to resist this new world order to resist this
[2:02:24.040 --> 2:02:29.240]  globalist hegemonic hegemonic if that's
[2:02:29.240 --> 2:02:33.400]  hegemon it's to reduce our ability to
[2:02:33.400 --> 2:02:36.040]  resist the monster the leviathan so it's not so much
[2:02:36.040 --> 2:02:39.960]  a war on men although that is occurring it's a war on our health and on our
[2:02:39.960 --> 2:02:43.560]  vigor it's a war on independence it's a war on liberty it's a war on
[2:02:43.560 --> 2:02:49.560]  common sense consciousness it's a war on free will it's a chemical war we are
[2:02:49.560 --> 2:02:53.160]  being it's chemical warfare literally but it's even the most chemical warfare
[2:02:53.160 --> 2:02:56.680]  the most insidious kind because it's biochemical warfare
[2:02:56.680 --> 2:03:00.280]  it's the kind of chemical warfare that that affects our
[2:03:00.280 --> 2:03:04.520]  biochemistry and on this is where the whole idea of epigenetics comes from
[2:03:04.520 --> 2:03:07.480]  this is why they don't want us to know about epigenetics this is why you keep
[2:03:07.480 --> 2:03:10.680]  hearing about genetics they don't want you to know that you have control over
[2:03:10.680 --> 2:03:13.880]  how they don't know men are supposed to be incredibly energetic
[2:03:13.880 --> 2:03:17.720]  and feel crazed all the time my grandfathers were like me
[2:03:17.720 --> 2:03:20.760]  and people think i'm a weirdo nowadays because i'm crazed
[2:03:20.760 --> 2:03:24.280]  i'm just a barbarian texan i mean we're supposed to be barbarians
[2:03:24.280 --> 2:03:27.880]  that's how we built the frontier that's how we that's how we built the
[2:03:27.880 --> 2:03:31.240]  country you know we didn't build the country by sitting on our butts watching
[2:03:31.240 --> 2:03:35.320]  tv we built the country by chopping wood and going out there and exploring and
[2:03:35.320 --> 2:03:37.720]  seeing what was on the other side of the forest
[2:03:37.720 --> 2:03:41.560]  and all of this is regulated by the hormone testosterone
[2:03:41.560 --> 2:03:45.240]  this is the hormone of for men and for women not just for men you know we
[2:03:45.240 --> 2:03:48.280]  think of it as a male hormone but it's not just a male hormone it's also a
[2:03:48.280 --> 2:03:50.200]  female is that why women get so crazed when they take our
[2:03:50.200 --> 2:03:53.560]  super male vitality it could be i don't know
[2:03:53.560 --> 2:03:56.200]  well it just has a bigger effect like i want i'm it's not a plug here at the end
[2:03:56.200 --> 2:03:59.000]  but i want to get your analysis of this man i know you like it's an awesome
[2:03:59.000 --> 2:04:01.800]  product i it's a awesome it's trebilous

[2:04:07.720 --> 2:04:11.720]  called adaptogenic herbs and these are herbs that help you adapt
[2:04:11.720 --> 2:04:15.720]  to the environment there's no nuclear there's no medicines that are adaptogenic
[2:04:15.720 --> 2:04:20.120]  only nutrients and herbs are adaptive genetic and adaptive genic your herb
[2:04:20.120 --> 2:04:23.480]  or adaptive genic nutrient is a nutrient that pulls you up when you need to be
[2:04:23.480 --> 2:04:26.520]  pulled up or pulls you down when you need to be pulled down the same the

[2:04:35.880 --> 2:04:38.080]  This is what an adaptogen does.

[2:04:41.280 --> 2:04:43.520]  the epigenetic component of genetics.

[2:04:59.800 --> 2:05:05.960]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with
[2:05:05.960 --> 2:05:11.320]  the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[2:05:11.320 --> 2:05:13.400]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[2:05:13.400 --> 2:05:14.400]  Fluoride.
[2:05:14.400 --> 2:05:16.040]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[2:05:16.040 --> 2:05:21.800]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add
[2:05:21.800 --> 2:05:22.800]  iodine.
[2:05:22.800 --> 2:05:28.760]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record, reports documented.
[2:05:28.760 --> 2:05:34.040]  A 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[2:05:34.040 --> 2:05:39.760]  Bottom line, iodine is important, unbound, clean, in a glycerin base.
[2:05:39.760 --> 2:05:42.920]  Nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.

[2:06:05.480 --> 2:06:08.560]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[2:06:08.560 --> 2:06:14.120]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism, and every other major disease?
[2:06:14.120 --> 2:06:16.080]  It all comes down to one thing.
[2:06:16.080 --> 2:06:17.720]  We are what we eat.
[2:06:17.720 --> 2:06:22.360]  Our food is devoid of nutrition and processed with poisons and additives.
[2:06:22.360 --> 2:06:26.600]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[2:06:26.600 --> 2:06:29.160]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[2:06:29.160 --> 2:06:31.800]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicist.
[2:06:31.800 --> 2:06:35.360]  By giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[2:07:08.040 --> 2:07:10.560]  and cognitive ability of the American people.
[2:07:10.560 --> 2:07:14.400]  So why are the social engineers adding it to the water?
[2:07:14.400 --> 2:07:15.400]  Simple.
[2:07:15.400 --> 2:07:19.680]  Dumb down the host population that the parasitic technocracy is feeding on.
[2:07:19.680 --> 2:07:23.920]  We may not have been able to get fluoride out of the water supply yet, but we can help
[2:07:23.920 --> 2:07:25.240]  to get it out of our bodies.
[2:07:25.240 --> 2:07:31.280]  I am extremely excited to announce the exclusive InfowarsLive fluoride shield formulation using
[2:07:31.280 --> 2:07:36.960]  six of the best documented ingredients from around the world to help the body remove not
[2:07:36.960 --> 2:07:41.800]  just toxic fluoride residues from the body, but a whole host of toxic substances.
[2:07:41.800 --> 2:07:46.080]  Let's take a stand against the globalist by blocking their poisons with fluoride shield.
[2:07:46.080 --> 2:07:51.720]  I use fluoride shield every day, secure your fluoride shield and other pioneering formulations
[2:07:51.720 --> 2:07:54.120]  at InfowarsLive.com today.
[2:07:54.120 --> 2:08:09.120]  Let's start cleansing our bodies now and support the Infowar at the same time that's InfowarsLive.com.
[2:08:09.120 --> 2:08:16.120]  Crashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[2:08:39.120 --> 2:08:49.520]  Well, John Casoretto is here with us in studio with John McAfee, of course, the inventor
[2:08:49.520 --> 2:08:55.600]  of the antivirus software and known very well for the things that happen in police and a
[2:08:55.600 --> 2:08:57.440]  lot of big movies getting made about it right now.
[2:08:57.440 --> 2:09:01.640]  And he came out here about five or six months ago, did some 50 cal shooting with us and did
[2:09:01.640 --> 2:09:02.640]  a great job.
[2:09:02.640 --> 2:09:07.560]  And of course, I've interviewed him before that when he was on the run from the kleptocratic
[2:09:07.560 --> 2:09:13.640]  authorities down in police, but he's back in the good old U.S. of A and he's with the
[2:09:13.640 --> 2:09:18.720]  investigative reporter John Casoretto with us today who writes for some big publications
[2:09:18.720 --> 2:09:19.720]  out in California.
[2:09:19.720 --> 2:09:24.640]  We're going to be going over exclusive John McAfee's ultimate hack and that's one of
[2:09:24.640 --> 2:09:32.200]  his articles from siliconangle.com and another report exclusive deconstructing McAfee.
[2:09:32.200 --> 2:09:36.160]  And we're going to get into some big breaking news with police and how it ties in the United
[2:09:36.160 --> 2:09:37.160]  States.
[2:09:37.160 --> 2:09:42.640]  It was probably six months ago or even more when John McAfee was here and he was in studio
[2:09:42.640 --> 2:09:43.800]  with us.
[2:09:43.800 --> 2:09:48.880]  And I was just amazed that stuff he told us six months before that about Ryerson and
[2:09:48.880 --> 2:09:53.160]  things that no one had talked about in the press turned out to be true connected to the
[2:09:53.160 --> 2:09:55.720]  government and I ran down in police.
[2:09:55.720 --> 2:10:00.000]  I mean, I still aired that nightly news interview, but I was really concerned about it.
[2:10:00.000 --> 2:10:01.080]  Not that I was doubting him.
[2:10:01.080 --> 2:10:04.600]  It's just that no one had said this but him.
[2:10:04.600 --> 2:10:09.000]  And so now I'm really going to pay attention to what they get to at the bottom of the hour.
[2:10:09.000 --> 2:10:10.000]  But guys, give us a sneak peek.
[2:10:10.000 --> 2:10:13.440]  I want to get into Obamacare first and how they tried to hire you and how that later
[2:10:13.440 --> 2:10:17.280]  came out in the news and where you see all that's going, John, but give us a sneak peek
[2:10:17.280 --> 2:10:20.560]  here and tell us about this investigative journalist of what you're going to be talking
[2:10:20.560 --> 2:10:21.560]  about John McAfee.
[2:10:21.560 --> 2:10:31.360]  Well, basically, I came back to the States in December of 2012, I moved up to Portland.
[2:10:31.360 --> 2:10:39.000]  But no time has the Belichian government let go of their intent to silence me.
[2:10:39.000 --> 2:10:45.440]  Alex and the, finally, an event happened in Portland on the 12th of September of last
[2:10:45.440 --> 2:10:50.560]  year of, you know, major importance to me, it was an attempt on my life.
[2:10:50.560 --> 2:10:52.600]  My wife was with me at the time.
[2:10:52.600 --> 2:10:56.160]  We have sort of been underground ever since.
[2:10:56.160 --> 2:11:03.160]  I've gone to the FBI, I have finally decided to release all the data and I released it
[2:11:03.160 --> 2:11:05.360]  to John Casoretto.
[2:11:05.360 --> 2:11:11.120]  He came to visit me for a few days, spent full time pouring through all the evidence,
[2:11:11.120 --> 2:11:16.680]  conversations of Belichian officials, internal memos of the Belichian government and he
[2:11:16.680 --> 2:11:17.680]  became a believer.
[2:11:17.680 --> 2:11:18.680]  That's great.
[2:11:18.680 --> 2:11:19.680]  Your mic's not too good.
[2:11:19.680 --> 2:11:24.280]  We're going to put a couple of mics for you for a minute, keep going.
[2:11:24.280 --> 2:11:31.320]  I went back and as serialized this entire event, he wrote the first 2400 word segment
[2:11:31.320 --> 2:11:37.400]  two days ago and then the deconstructing McAfee, which is basically his first contact
[2:11:37.400 --> 2:11:41.240]  with me and how startling it all was to him.
[2:11:41.240 --> 2:11:45.920]  But I think John, when I first contacted him, it was extremely skeptical.
[2:11:45.920 --> 2:11:51.120]  After three days of pouring through evidence, telephone calls with individuals and officials
[2:11:51.120 --> 2:11:54.280]  and beliefs, he's become a firm believer.
[2:11:54.280 --> 2:11:59.960]  The evidence is there and I feel I have no other choice now but to go public with it
[2:11:59.960 --> 2:12:06.680]  and I think you're the first and I think you are the first broadcast agency that I have
[2:12:06.680 --> 2:12:07.680]  talked to.
[2:12:07.680 --> 2:12:10.800]  We're going to get into that at the bottom of the hour.
[2:12:10.800 --> 2:12:16.400]  First off, I want to get your breakdown here today on the fact that Obama did come to you
[2:12:16.400 --> 2:12:19.960]  and that letter came out in the press after you reported it here first, was confirmed,
[2:12:19.960 --> 2:12:24.800]  they reached out to you and others to quote FixHealthCare.gov and of course you said there's
[2:12:24.800 --> 2:12:25.800]  nothing to fix.
[2:12:25.800 --> 2:12:30.400]  It's a total fraud, it's a total joke, it's not even real and we concur with that analysis
[2:12:30.400 --> 2:12:35.840]  and other programmers have said they want to make the debate about the site not working,
[2:12:35.840 --> 2:12:40.720]  not what a screw job Obamacare is and it still doesn't work properly and the people who think
[2:12:40.720 --> 2:12:44.120]  they're signing up aren't signing up and now the IRS is saying they're using it to just
[2:12:44.120 --> 2:12:46.680]  register you to go grab your bank account.
[2:12:46.680 --> 2:12:48.760]  What is your take on Obamacare?
[2:12:48.760 --> 2:12:52.480]  What is your take on the Russia situation, the whole world, people want to know what
[2:12:52.480 --> 2:12:55.160]  John McAfee thinks about what's happening in the world.
[2:12:55.160 --> 2:12:58.360]  Okay, first of all it wasn't Obama himself that came.
[2:12:58.360 --> 2:12:59.360]  Sure, the White House.
[2:12:59.360 --> 2:13:03.960]  It was a lawyer from the House Ways and Means Committee that asked if I would consider coming
[2:13:03.960 --> 2:13:11.280]  and giving advice and I said no because my advice is simply scratch it and start over,
[2:13:11.280 --> 2:13:12.280]  scrap the whole thing.
[2:13:12.280 --> 2:13:17.000]  They wouldn't do that, I know that for a fact and I didn't want to waste my time nor theirs
[2:13:17.000 --> 2:13:20.080]  and turn them down.
[2:13:20.080 --> 2:13:21.720]  What do I think about the entire world?
[2:13:21.720 --> 2:13:26.720]  I think Alex that we're in a very dangerous situation in terms of privacy.
[2:13:26.720 --> 2:13:31.280]  The telephones that you have next to you and the telephones that each of us are carrying
[2:13:31.280 --> 2:13:38.480]  around with us contain applications from corporations, individuals, from the NSA, the CIA, from almost
[2:13:38.480 --> 2:13:46.080]  every agency and if you look at what these applications are doing an overwhelming majority
[2:13:46.080 --> 2:13:51.560]  of them are turning on your microphone, turning on the camera, accessing your emails, accessing
[2:13:51.560 --> 2:13:57.600]  your SMS messages and even making phone calls on your behalf without your knowledge.
[2:13:57.600 --> 2:14:01.800]  We're in a very dangerous situation because we have accepted a technology that we do not
[2:14:01.800 --> 2:14:03.360]  understand yet.
[2:14:03.360 --> 2:14:05.200]  We don't understand its weaknesses.
[2:14:05.200 --> 2:14:08.200]  We don't understand its limitations.
[2:14:08.200 --> 2:14:12.880]  The Bank of America for example, if you use the Bank of America online banking app you
[2:14:12.880 --> 2:14:17.640]  will find that you have given it permission to turn on your camera and take videos and
[2:14:17.640 --> 2:14:20.280]  still pictures anytime that it wants.
[2:14:20.280 --> 2:14:21.280]  Why?
[2:14:21.280 --> 2:14:25.720]  Well perhaps it's because if you empty your bank account online and then say I didn't
[2:14:25.720 --> 2:14:28.440]  do it they can say well you know we have photos of you.
[2:14:28.440 --> 2:14:30.000]  But think about how big brother that is.
[2:14:30.000 --> 2:14:33.840]  We've known they've been doing that for decades using the webcams but they would deny it.
[2:14:33.840 --> 2:14:35.040]  Now it's just ubiquitous.
[2:14:35.040 --> 2:14:36.040]  They're just doing it.
[2:14:36.040 --> 2:14:39.520]  Right and the webcams is one thing because you don't sleep with your computer.
[2:14:39.520 --> 2:14:40.960]  You don't carry it with you all the time.
[2:14:40.960 --> 2:14:45.800]  We carry our phones with us, our smart phones and there's an overwhelming percentage of
[2:14:45.800 --> 2:14:49.360]  these apps that are spying on you and big time.
[2:14:49.360 --> 2:14:53.280]  So we've written an application or I've written an application called Cognizant which basically
[2:14:53.280 --> 2:14:57.760]  goes through and tells you what all of your apps are doing and gives you the choice of
[2:14:57.760 --> 2:14:59.040]  getting rid of them or not.
[2:14:59.040 --> 2:15:00.040]  That is awesome.
[2:15:00.040 --> 2:15:01.040]  How do folks get that app?
[2:15:01.040 --> 2:15:02.520]  It's coming out in five days.
[2:15:02.520 --> 2:15:03.520]  It's free.
[2:15:03.520 --> 2:15:05.600]  We're not charging anything for it.
[2:15:05.600 --> 2:15:09.120]  It does not have any adware and it doesn't expire after a period of time.
[2:15:09.120 --> 2:15:11.360]  Yeah and that's awesome and it just tells you what's going on.
[2:15:11.360 --> 2:15:14.640]  It tells you what's going on and you're going to be shocked.
[2:15:14.640 --> 2:15:18.720]  Absolutely shocked and for our first version runs on Android we'll be moving into other
[2:15:18.720 --> 2:15:20.040]  platforms later.
[2:15:20.040 --> 2:15:23.640]  Android is the worst in terms of app permission.
[2:15:23.640 --> 2:15:30.360]  So people who've used it, John used it and he was kind of shocked at, whoa, my apps are
[2:15:30.360 --> 2:15:33.840]  doing this and then it gives you the option to get rid of them.
[2:15:33.840 --> 2:15:37.080]  But this is a serious problem because it's not just the US government.
[2:15:37.080 --> 2:15:43.920]  We do know that NASA is putting out apps and other covert agencies but it's corporations
[2:15:43.920 --> 2:15:51.920]  and individuals that are using our innocence basically in accepting these permissions to
[2:15:51.920 --> 2:15:53.480]  do anything that they want.
[2:15:53.480 --> 2:15:55.080]  Bank of America, what is Bank of America?
[2:15:55.080 --> 2:15:56.920]  It is a collection of its employees.
[2:15:56.920 --> 2:16:01.600]  Any employee with access to their data center can spend their lunch hour listening to what
[2:16:01.600 --> 2:16:04.400]  you're doing no matter where you are.
[2:16:04.400 --> 2:16:08.640]  And it's come out that they harass girlfriends, ex-wives, husbands, that they are indeed using
[2:16:08.640 --> 2:16:10.160]  it to play God.
[2:16:10.160 --> 2:16:11.480]  Yes, absolutely.
[2:16:11.480 --> 2:16:12.480]  And we're letting them.
[2:16:12.480 --> 2:16:14.800]  We're letting them through our ignorance and our innocence.
[2:16:14.800 --> 2:16:19.680]  When I say ignorance, we're unaware of what has happened and they don't want you to be
[2:16:19.680 --> 2:16:20.680]  aware of it.
[2:16:20.680 --> 2:16:21.680]  Isn't that the big hurdle though?
[2:16:21.680 --> 2:16:22.680]  They tried to deny it existed.
[2:16:22.680 --> 2:16:24.160]  Now it's admitted they lied.
[2:16:24.160 --> 2:16:25.520]  It's admitted it's huge.
[2:16:25.520 --> 2:16:26.600]  It's totally illegal.
[2:16:26.600 --> 2:16:32.080]  I think that's the beginning of the end of the system if they simply, if the people simply
[2:16:32.080 --> 2:16:33.080]  say no.
[2:16:33.080 --> 2:16:35.040]  Well, can we say no?
[2:16:35.040 --> 2:16:36.040]  Here's the issue.
[2:16:36.040 --> 2:16:37.040]  We depend on these funds.
[2:16:37.040 --> 2:16:38.120]  We depend on the power.
[2:16:38.120 --> 2:16:45.000]  We depend on the ability to communicate and to contact our families and to voice chat
[2:16:45.000 --> 2:16:47.360]  and video chat.
[2:16:47.360 --> 2:16:50.040]  So what we need is we need legislation.
[2:16:50.040 --> 2:16:56.520]  We need some serious, hard looking at what's actually happening and say, listen, we have
[2:16:56.520 --> 2:16:57.520]  to stop this.
[2:16:57.520 --> 2:17:01.920]  We cannot have a total loss of privacy that is occurring.
[2:17:01.920 --> 2:17:03.480]  You have no concept.
[2:17:03.480 --> 2:17:07.320]  Once you get this app and you run it on your Android system, you will be shocked.
[2:17:07.320 --> 2:17:10.240]  Everybody who has run it and testing has been shocked.
[2:17:10.240 --> 2:17:11.240]  It ranks the apps.
[2:17:11.240 --> 2:17:16.840]  Like how much of a threat each individual app has a number associated with it that tells
[2:17:16.840 --> 2:17:20.680]  you this app has got a ranking of 50 something, 60 something.
[2:17:20.680 --> 2:17:25.160]  So you can say that app has got a high score.
[2:17:25.160 --> 2:17:28.360]  I'm uncomfortable with the amount of information that's coming out of this thing out of my
[2:17:28.360 --> 2:17:31.640]  phone and it's time to remove that.
[2:17:31.640 --> 2:17:32.640]  Yeah.
[2:17:32.640 --> 2:17:33.640]  It's pretty neat.
[2:17:33.640 --> 2:17:35.040]  Well, I can't wait till that comes out.
[2:17:35.040 --> 2:17:38.520]  In fact, that's what I wanted to get you on about originally was when you come out with
[2:17:38.520 --> 2:17:39.520]  these devices.
[2:17:39.520 --> 2:17:41.720]  Are you still working on a device that...
[2:17:41.720 --> 2:17:42.720]  Absolutely.
[2:17:42.720 --> 2:17:46.760]  And the device Decentral is still coming and the Cognizant app is going to be...
[2:17:46.760 --> 2:17:47.760]  It's called Decentral.
[2:17:47.760 --> 2:17:48.760]  Decentral.
[2:17:48.760 --> 2:17:51.760]  The Cognizant app is going to be the kernel of that.
[2:17:51.760 --> 2:17:54.520]  It will morph into Decentral slowly.
[2:17:54.520 --> 2:17:56.600]  So we are still on target.
[2:17:56.600 --> 2:17:59.080]  We are still working on privacy.
[2:17:59.080 --> 2:18:02.440]  So you're the guy that launched the whole antivirus revolution.
[2:18:02.440 --> 2:18:07.000]  And so, I mean, it's pretty exciting to have you doing this.
[2:18:07.000 --> 2:18:08.000]  I did.
[2:18:08.000 --> 2:18:11.440]  They, of course, changed my name now or we'll be changing it soon.
[2:18:11.440 --> 2:18:14.240]  The Intel is changing it to just Intel security.
[2:18:14.240 --> 2:18:19.760]  Not sure that's the wise move on their part, but I think my wild and crazy personality
[2:18:19.760 --> 2:18:20.760]  makes them nervous.
[2:18:20.760 --> 2:18:21.760]  So...
[2:18:21.760 --> 2:18:25.040]  So they're going to change the name of the company you started, McAfee.
[2:18:25.040 --> 2:18:26.040]  Not Mc...
[2:18:26.040 --> 2:18:27.800]  Not the company, but they're changing the name of the product.
[2:18:27.800 --> 2:18:28.800]  Yeah.
[2:18:28.800 --> 2:18:29.800]  They're changing it to...
[2:18:29.800 --> 2:18:33.640]  I think it's called Intel security.
[2:18:33.640 --> 2:18:37.400]  What do you think now of the fact that it's come out that the FBI is, indeed, creating
[2:18:37.400 --> 2:18:40.280]  a lot of the viruses and stuff to hack into people's computers?
[2:18:40.280 --> 2:18:44.040]  Well, you know, I said this early on.
[2:18:44.040 --> 2:18:46.920]  This is what's happening and it's going to simply get worse.
[2:18:46.920 --> 2:18:50.680]  They are taking advantage of the weaknesses in our technology.
[2:18:50.680 --> 2:18:56.720]  The weaknesses, the leaks, the back doors, the ease in which someone can get into your
[2:18:56.720 --> 2:18:59.320]  computer and look at everything that's happening.
[2:18:59.320 --> 2:19:00.320]  Read your emails.
[2:19:00.320 --> 2:19:01.880]  Read your text messages.
[2:19:01.880 --> 2:19:02.880]  Listen to you.
[2:19:02.880 --> 2:19:03.880]  Watch you.
[2:19:03.880 --> 2:19:10.520]  They can even use your phone to make calls on their behalf and without your knowledge.
[2:19:10.520 --> 2:19:14.760]  And to be clear, it's not like they're targeting one guy with a warrant with some spyware.
[2:19:14.760 --> 2:19:20.720]  They'll put out 10 million computers that get infected to, quote, find one guy so that
[2:19:20.720 --> 2:19:22.720]  when he logs in, they know.
[2:19:22.720 --> 2:19:25.720]  I mean, no, that's just an excuse to spy on everybody.
[2:19:25.720 --> 2:19:26.720]  It is.
[2:19:26.720 --> 2:19:27.720]  Absolutely.
[2:19:27.720 --> 2:19:33.360]  And the only solution, I think, is public awareness and we need to lobby our legislators
[2:19:33.360 --> 2:19:35.600]  to change the laws to make this illegal.
[2:19:35.600 --> 2:19:36.760]  Well, it's just funny.
[2:19:36.760 --> 2:19:41.240]  The theory was always that the virus company, antivirus company makers were the ones putting
[2:19:41.240 --> 2:19:42.240]  the viruses out.
[2:19:42.240 --> 2:19:43.920]  But we've never really seen them caught doing that.
[2:19:43.920 --> 2:19:45.400]  It's always government that's doing it.
[2:19:45.400 --> 2:19:49.320]  Well, that would be like carrying coals to Newcastle or adding water to the ocean.
[2:19:49.320 --> 2:19:53.080]  I mean, there are enough people out there writing viruses that antivirus companies would
[2:19:53.080 --> 2:19:54.280]  not need to do that.
[2:19:54.280 --> 2:19:58.040]  The same thing now, anti-malware companies, it would be foolish to write malware.
[2:19:58.040 --> 2:19:59.040]  Stay there.
[2:19:59.040 --> 2:20:01.040]  John McAfee and his investigative reporter.

[2:22:57.160 --> 2:23:03.600]  The global of social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[2:23:03.600 --> 2:23:06.000]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[2:23:06.000 --> 2:23:11.320]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimicers that lower our testosterone and other
[2:23:11.320 --> 2:23:14.520]  hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[2:23:14.520 --> 2:23:17.920]  African Sultan top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists, and others.

[2:24:23.920 --> 2:24:30.800]  All right, John Casoretto is here, investigative journalist with John McAfee who really doesn't
[2:24:30.800 --> 2:24:38.160]  need any introduction and we are broadcasting worldwide on, it's already the 13th day of,
[2:24:38.160 --> 2:24:42.040]  hard to believe, March 2000, 2014.
[2:24:42.040 --> 2:24:46.880]  Time is just flying past us right now and I want to shift gears.
[2:24:46.880 --> 2:24:52.160]  We'll get into some other subjects later into now what really happened in Belize versus
[2:24:52.160 --> 2:24:57.400]  all these big Warner Brothers and Paramount and they're all making movies about John McAfee
[2:24:57.400 --> 2:24:59.760]  and I don't really see you being interviewed by those folks.
[2:24:59.760 --> 2:25:04.360]  I guess they've got a story they want to put out but now you can give us the rest of the
[2:25:04.360 --> 2:25:09.240]  story and again, when you were telling me some of the story first, when you first had
[2:25:09.240 --> 2:25:12.920]  come back to the U.S., I found it unbelievable and I apologize.
[2:25:12.920 --> 2:25:14.000]  I didn't say I thought you were lying.
[2:25:14.000 --> 2:25:18.920]  I just said, man folks, I don't know if this is true about, you know, Ryerson and all these
[2:25:18.920 --> 2:25:21.440]  other stuff going on at government people.
[2:25:21.440 --> 2:25:26.040]  I was just, you know, shocked by it all and then some of that news came out about Ryerson
[2:25:26.040 --> 2:25:31.120]  plots and passports and Iranians and it sounded like a James Bond movie, John McAfee.
[2:25:31.120 --> 2:25:34.680]  We've done a lot of secret black ops work for the government previously.
[2:25:34.680 --> 2:25:36.320]  None of that's involved this time.
[2:25:36.320 --> 2:25:37.320]  Okay.
[2:25:37.320 --> 2:25:41.240]  Do you want to take it from here and explain, you know, how we fell into this?
[2:25:41.240 --> 2:25:42.560]  Yeah, you know, absolutely.
[2:25:42.560 --> 2:25:48.120]  That's when I came into the story at a point in time where I started to interview John about
[2:25:48.120 --> 2:25:52.600]  his application about some of the things that were going on about cyber security and that's
[2:25:52.600 --> 2:25:58.160]  what drew me into the story because I was there at that point in time at which it was
[2:25:58.160 --> 2:25:59.160]  interesting.
[2:25:59.160 --> 2:26:05.120]  John was actually putting out ads for people to be bodyguards and what he was trying to
[2:26:05.120 --> 2:26:10.360]  do was smoke out the cartel and it just got deeper from there, right?
[2:26:10.360 --> 2:26:18.800]  So the cartel and the people that McAfee that were after him and put an attempt on his life
[2:26:18.800 --> 2:26:24.760]  as John described earlier in Portland, you know, he was trying to discover who these
[2:26:24.760 --> 2:26:29.160]  guys were, you know, they're organized, but they're not that smart.
[2:26:29.160 --> 2:26:30.160]  So he would put out ads.
[2:26:30.160 --> 2:26:31.160]  It was interesting.
[2:26:31.160 --> 2:26:35.920]  He actually had an interview with one of these gentlemen in a cafe and, you know, had lunch
[2:26:35.920 --> 2:26:36.920]  with them.
[2:26:36.920 --> 2:26:39.560]  The guy never asked for the actual job, right?
[2:26:39.560 --> 2:26:45.480]  So a bunch of interesting stories as far as his life, you know, along the way and some
[2:26:45.480 --> 2:26:49.200]  of these things that happened as the story unfolded.
[2:26:49.200 --> 2:26:56.040]  But it really all goes back to those days in Belize when he was out there and he encountered
[2:26:56.040 --> 2:27:01.760]  this situation with the government down there and the selling of passports and recorded
[2:27:01.760 --> 2:27:05.880]  all this information that they're after and that's really why they're after John in the
[2:27:05.880 --> 2:27:10.680]  first place is that he's got this information, he's collected this information and we have
[2:27:10.680 --> 2:27:18.320]  a lot of this stuff that will be coming out in this report that is very publicly discoverable
[2:27:18.320 --> 2:27:22.920]  information that we've organized and will be put into this thing and that will be forthcoming
[2:27:22.920 --> 2:27:25.640]  on SiliconANGLE.
[2:27:25.640 --> 2:27:30.520]  The problem is when they raided my property on March the 2nd, this was the result of my
[2:27:30.520 --> 2:27:37.400]  refusing to pay a bribe to the local politician and then the politician came back, you know,
[2:27:37.400 --> 2:27:41.120]  the next week saying, oh, this is more a terrible thing to happen, I am so sorry, you know,
[2:27:41.120 --> 2:27:45.600]  they shot your dog, they destroyed your property, this is so terrible, have you reconsidered
[2:27:45.600 --> 2:27:49.160]  your donation, you know, I basically threw him off my property and went to the international
[2:27:49.160 --> 2:27:50.160]  press.
[2:27:50.160 --> 2:27:54.680]  I also donated a whole bunch of computers to the Belizean government that had keystroke
[2:27:54.680 --> 2:27:58.600]  locking software and software that I had put on there.
[2:27:58.600 --> 2:28:01.760]  Classic Trojan horse, classic Trojan horse.
[2:28:01.760 --> 2:28:07.960]  I was hoping just to find out of hard evidence that they had planted this whole thing, just
[2:28:07.960 --> 2:28:10.760]  planned this whole thing just to force me to pay the money.
[2:28:10.760 --> 2:28:14.700]  What I found out was far worse, I found out that they were selling passports, I found
[2:28:14.700 --> 2:28:20.280]  out that almost all of the government ministers were involved in some kind of nefarious and
[2:28:20.280 --> 2:28:25.360]  illegal activities and it just went from bad to worse.
[2:28:25.360 --> 2:28:33.960]  They discovered what I was doing in late September of that year and began a serious process of
[2:28:33.960 --> 2:28:34.960]  intimidation.
[2:28:34.960 --> 2:28:40.480]  I have given John all of this evidence, John has talked to witnesses in Belize, the people
[2:28:40.480 --> 2:28:45.560]  who were with me and has verified everything that I have said.
[2:28:45.560 --> 2:28:49.600]  Then when Greg Fall was murdered in November, which I firmly believe now was an act of the
[2:28:49.600 --> 2:28:54.120]  government, they came after me for real, not just at night but during the day.
[2:28:54.120 --> 2:28:58.200]  For an entire month before the Greg Fall murdered, they were trying to collect me at night.
[2:28:58.200 --> 2:29:00.800]  I was finding out about it because I was listening to them.
[2:29:00.800 --> 2:29:05.960]  I was watching them through their computers and they never could catch me because when
[2:29:05.960 --> 2:29:07.560]  they would show up, I'd be somewhere else.
[2:29:07.560 --> 2:29:10.760]  And I remember in all the media stuff, didn't you record them and you've released some
[2:29:10.760 --> 2:29:11.760]  of them before?
[2:29:11.760 --> 2:29:13.520]  I released a little bit.
[2:29:13.520 --> 2:29:14.520]  Just to prove it.
[2:29:14.520 --> 2:29:19.880]  Here's what I'm trying to do, Alex, I'm trying to, number one, stay alive.
[2:29:19.880 --> 2:29:24.280]  The only thing that I have to bargain with is those recordings.
[2:29:24.280 --> 2:29:30.200]  The thing that I am attempting to do is to make the public aware that this is actually
[2:29:30.200 --> 2:29:33.840]  happening without providing enough evidence to put everybody away.
[2:29:33.840 --> 2:29:35.920]  I mean, there are a few people that need to be put away.
[2:29:35.920 --> 2:29:37.360]  All right, long segment coming up.
[2:29:37.360 --> 2:29:41.920]  Let's get into as much of this as we can with John McAfee and the investigative journalist
[2:29:41.920 --> 2:29:42.920]  who is with us.
[2:29:42.920 --> 2:29:43.920]  WhoisMcAfee.com.
[2:29:43.920 --> 2:29:44.920]  Is that the best website, John?
[2:29:44.920 --> 2:29:45.920]  That's the best website.
[2:29:45.920 --> 2:29:50.000]  Right back, I'm Alex Jones.
[2:29:50.000 --> 2:29:54.000]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[2:29:54.000 --> 2:30:01.520]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[2:30:01.520 --> 2:30:05.960]  Alex Jones here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide, also enjoying
[2:30:05.960 --> 2:30:11.080]  what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet for more than
[2:30:11.080 --> 2:30:12.080]  a decade.
[2:30:12.080 --> 2:30:16.360]  My favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico, where the Chiapas farmers
[2:30:16.360 --> 2:30:19.000]  grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[2:30:19.000 --> 2:30:24.320]  We have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend.

[2:30:35.240 --> 2:30:37.960]  heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[2:30:37.960 --> 2:30:42.240]  Once down, this is my favorite coffee, and it's taken us years to secure connections
[2:30:42.240 --> 2:30:44.800]  directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.

[2:30:59.440 --> 2:31:01.440]  Available at infowarslife.com.
[2:31:01.440 --> 2:31:06.160]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda, they are manipulating
[2:31:06.160 --> 2:31:07.160]  our genetics.
[2:31:07.160 --> 2:31:12.680]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimicers that lower our testosterone and other

[2:32:01.480 --> 2:32:06.720]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with
[2:32:06.720 --> 2:32:12.200]  the halogen bromine, a practice now banned in nations around the world.
[2:32:12.200 --> 2:32:14.200]  Guess what else is in the halogen family?
[2:32:14.200 --> 2:32:15.200]  Fluoride.
[2:32:15.200 --> 2:32:16.800]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here.
[2:32:16.800 --> 2:32:22.560]  In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add
[2:32:22.560 --> 2:32:23.560]  iodine.
[2:32:23.560 --> 2:32:29.520]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record, reports documented,
[2:32:29.520 --> 2:32:34.800]  a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[2:32:34.800 --> 2:32:37.160]  Bottom line, iodine is important.
[2:32:37.160 --> 2:32:43.680]  Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.

[2:32:59.960 --> 2:33:28.960]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones.
[2:33:28.960 --> 2:33:56.360]  Thank you all so much for being here.
[2:33:56.360 --> 2:34:03.360]  who McAvie is and they are breaking down what basically really happened in
[2:34:03.360 --> 2:34:07.440]  police and how it ties into things here but but how does that tie into the
[2:34:07.440 --> 2:34:11.560]  riots and poison and the Iranians because you did say that six months
[2:34:11.560 --> 2:34:16.600]  before it ended up coming out separate from you in the news there and it has
[2:34:16.600 --> 2:34:20.560]  come out you really did have all these however many computers it was that you'd
[2:34:20.560 --> 2:34:24.080]  handed out to all the police the federal police there how many computers was it
[2:34:24.080 --> 2:34:29.440]  total and where's the whole Ryerson situation going it was a little over
[2:34:29.440 --> 2:34:33.720]  80 computers total the Ryerson situation I don't want to discuss it at the
[2:34:33.720 --> 2:34:38.060]  current moment for security reasons and I can discuss everything else the
[2:34:38.060 --> 2:34:42.920]  passports because really it all it all folds in there's a huge operation in
[2:34:42.920 --> 2:34:48.440]  police and it's getting unraveled as we speak the minister of immigration a
[2:34:48.440 --> 2:34:53.840]  guy named Pat Panner was just removed from office for selling over 150 passports
[2:34:53.840 --> 2:34:59.320]  one of which was to a Korean who was in prison at the time and had never been
[2:34:59.320 --> 2:35:04.440]  to police now Panner when he was under oath said that yes I had you I think
[2:35:04.440 --> 2:35:08.160]  you've you read these same reports from the Blesian news said that yeah we I had
[2:35:08.160 --> 2:35:12.680]  a meeting with the gentleman on this date and you know he explained everything
[2:35:12.680 --> 2:35:18.080]  was happening well on that date he was in prison in Korea so this is how bad it
[2:35:18.080 --> 2:35:22.080]  gets and Panner has been prosecuted he hasn't been investigated they're just
[2:35:22.080 --> 2:35:25.840]  letting it all letting it all slide you know John McAfee I've gotten to hang
[2:35:25.840 --> 2:35:30.040]  around with you quite a bit now I've got to say though behind the scenes too why
[2:35:30.040 --> 2:35:33.600]  do they have that one guy on the Doseki's most interesting man we need to
[2:35:33.600 --> 2:35:37.680]  get you as the new Doseki spokesman well actually they were talking about you as
[2:35:37.680 --> 2:35:41.400]  the CEO of Microsoft they were they were that would be a what about the spokesman
[2:35:41.400 --> 2:35:44.880]  for Captain Morgan Rome I mean you're a spitting image actually I just did a
[2:35:44.880 --> 2:35:49.480]  most interesting man commercial for quick funder which is I didn't know that
[2:35:49.480 --> 2:35:53.440]  see I did it came out on Monday aren't I a good brander you're a great brander I
[2:35:53.440 --> 2:35:56.880]  should that officially I came out when I see it's almost like you started a
[2:35:56.880 --> 2:36:00.640]  company that made billions of dollars yeah so so I did it for quick fun that's
[2:36:00.640 --> 2:36:04.240]  a crowdfunding outfit of one of the new ones and one of the better ones in in
[2:36:04.240 --> 2:36:09.880]  Atlanta I like this style I think they have you know probably the best security
[2:36:09.880 --> 2:36:13.720]  and the best approach of any the crowdfunding outfit so I did the the
[2:36:13.720 --> 2:36:16.960]  quick funder commercial where I was the most interesting man in the world and so
[2:36:16.960 --> 2:36:20.080]  that as we pull up the quick funder commercial I'm gonna play that later yeah
[2:36:20.080 --> 2:36:24.080]  just go on YouTube under under all this cloak and dagger now look you did do
[2:36:24.080 --> 2:36:29.000]  black project stuff for the government previous to the McAfee I did I did I was
[2:36:29.000 --> 2:36:32.680]  I worked for Lockheed on a black program but what's the secret because this does
[2:36:32.680 --> 2:36:38.120]  sound spy-esque CIA defense intelligence or corporate stuff down in
[2:36:38.120 --> 2:36:41.480]  Belize I mean were they using you as a double agent is there a whole nother
[2:36:41.480 --> 2:36:44.800]  story to this we don't know about trust me if I were a double agent when I be on
[2:36:44.800 --> 2:36:47.800]  here on your program I mean I would walk out the door and it would be the US
[2:36:47.800 --> 2:36:51.200]  government that would whack me nothing not the car no no no I understand that
[2:36:51.200 --> 2:36:54.480]  but but I mean there's also good elements of the government and my
[2:36:54.480 --> 2:36:58.880]  experience I don't think there's no there's no ultimate bad and and
[2:36:58.880 --> 2:37:02.720]  ultimate good anywhere there's a mixture of course but no I believe me I am not
[2:37:02.720 --> 2:37:07.120]  affiliated I'm not a part of any US government covert operation I'm saying
[2:37:07.120 --> 2:37:11.240]  you're evading them all the things you did the Trojan horse computers
[2:37:11.240 --> 2:37:15.480]  everything I mean that's real James Bond stuff because the real spies I've
[2:37:15.480 --> 2:37:19.280]  run into an FBI people and stuff when we've been you know doing stories are
[2:37:19.280 --> 2:37:23.880]  trying to infiltrate or set us up they are bumbling boobies compared to the
[2:37:23.880 --> 2:37:26.760]  work you've been doing well by and large you're absolutely correct and that's
[2:37:26.760 --> 2:37:30.320]  because they have to adhere to the formula that the US government or
[2:37:30.320 --> 2:37:34.200]  whatever agency they're working for makes them adhere to you have to be
[2:37:34.200 --> 2:37:38.120]  completely free you've got to be you know a libertarian so it's the
[2:37:38.120 --> 2:37:42.320]  departmentalization ruining US intelligence absolutely absolutely I
[2:37:42.320 --> 2:37:48.320]  mean I for example I'm one man I'm on my own and by hiring you know a few out of
[2:37:48.320 --> 2:37:54.800]  work of you know young young men and women I was able to infiltrate every
[2:37:54.800 --> 2:37:58.400]  branch of the ablation government admittedly this is not a country well
[2:37:58.400 --> 2:38:02.480]  former spy masters like like Dr. Steve Pachennick they've told me the system is
[2:38:02.480 --> 2:38:08.080]  scared of lone men yes because we that we we are unpredictable I have given
[2:38:08.080 --> 2:38:14.320]  this man internal documents internal memos from police which are absolutely
[2:38:14.320 --> 2:38:17.160]  well tell us what you can tell us about your findings that are going to be
[2:38:17.160 --> 2:38:20.520]  rolling out or already on your site some of them I mean you'll give us in a
[2:38:20.520 --> 2:38:24.880]  nutshell what's going on what happened the groups tracking you okay the biggest
[2:38:24.880 --> 2:38:28.120]  thing that I discovered and the biggest thing they're trying to cover up is the
[2:38:28.120 --> 2:38:33.560]  the selling of passports and the bringing of questionable people into
[2:38:33.560 --> 2:38:39.960]  America through a very complex route you can let's say if I'm I'm Iranian or
[2:38:39.960 --> 2:38:46.280]  or a packet of from Pakistan of and I want a new identity I can come to
[2:38:46.280 --> 2:38:49.360]  believe some pain anywhere from a hundred and fifty thousand to a half a
[2:38:49.360 --> 2:38:54.080]  million dollars I get a new identity usually from someone who's died my name
[2:38:54.080 --> 2:38:58.240]  is Muhammad Allah and suddenly my new name is is George Smith and I have a
[2:38:58.240 --> 2:39:02.200]  passport proving I am George Smith with that passport I am free to move
[2:39:02.200 --> 2:39:06.600]  throughout all of Central America all of Central America I'm unimpeded so
[2:39:06.600 --> 2:39:10.400]  they're creating fake identities on an international scale out of beliefs and
[2:39:10.400 --> 2:39:15.600]  that's come out yes and it's a major rat line absolutely and so to get into
[2:39:15.600 --> 2:39:19.760]  America if I want to do it you know unbeknownst to America I wander up to
[2:39:19.760 --> 2:39:24.320]  the southern border and get a mule to bring me across and the cartels help
[2:39:24.320 --> 2:39:28.480]  with that that's public knowledge I mean you've seen many reports in police
[2:39:28.480 --> 2:39:32.520]  where this is actually happening the police and snow but nobody else in the
[2:39:32.520 --> 2:39:36.080]  world is reading the reports and no one else even cares it seems did you see
[2:39:36.080 --> 2:39:39.600]  any evidence that the US or any other major government has it some people down
[2:39:39.600 --> 2:39:43.000]  there jacking into their database and know these people are they don't even
[2:39:43.000 --> 2:39:46.400]  care well certainly they know who they are the Treasury Department keeps for
[2:39:46.400 --> 2:39:51.800]  example an organization chart of like the similar cartel all the all the
[2:39:51.800 --> 2:39:56.600]  cartels the medallions and in that order but sure I mean the op the the people
[2:39:56.600 --> 2:40:00.760]  they're bringing across as we had the head Iranian general say last month we
[2:40:00.760 --> 2:40:04.720]  have sleeper cells in America yes and we will attack you an asymmetrical war
[2:40:04.720 --> 2:40:08.280]  yes yes absolutely and where do you think these people cells are coming from
[2:40:08.280 --> 2:40:11.960]  they don't fly in but you said a year ago a year ago on my show you said
[2:40:11.960 --> 2:40:15.200]  Iranian sleeper cells are coming through with rice and now you don't want to talk
[2:40:15.200 --> 2:40:18.840]  about it well forget the rice and they are coming through and they have more
[2:40:18.840 --> 2:40:22.120]  than just rice and Alex there's all kinds of things that they are bringing
[2:40:22.120 --> 2:40:26.080]  with them I can't talk about the rice and right now I'm very sorry that I can't
[2:40:26.080 --> 2:40:32.760]  I am I am I am sort of fighting for my life I am I am I am I am I am dancing a
[2:40:32.760 --> 2:40:36.120]  very delicate dance you've already got cartels after you don't want to
[2:40:36.120 --> 2:40:41.400]  Iranians after I don't want the Iranians after me sir okay it's bad enough as it
[2:40:41.400 --> 2:40:47.240]  is so now but but forget that part we still have the the importing into
[2:40:47.240 --> 2:40:54.080]  America of foreigners of question with questionable motives on a mass scale we
[2:40:54.080 --> 2:40:58.160]  have this one man selling a hundred and a hundred and fifty passports in a very
[2:40:58.160 --> 2:41:05.000]  brief period of time we have group it's it's like you know okay if you come to
[2:41:05.000 --> 2:41:08.600]  us with 50 people will give you a group discount I mean it's astonishing and
[2:41:08.600 --> 2:41:13.560]  these 150 were we're just the 150 that were discovered you know that it's
[2:41:13.560 --> 2:41:19.000]  much more than this so this is a serious problem no one's talking about it
[2:41:19.000 --> 2:41:22.360]  it's public knowledge everywhere else in the world public knowledge but here in
[2:41:22.360 --> 2:41:26.200]  the states it's like let's not talk about this John Casoretto investigative
[2:41:26.200 --> 2:41:29.320]  journalist you've been burrowing into this for a long time I looked you up and
[2:41:29.320 --> 2:41:33.440]  a lot of great reports in the past much of what he says been already verified
[2:41:33.440 --> 2:41:36.640]  but but but what else have you verified this story what do you think about it
[2:41:36.640 --> 2:41:41.720]  well you know I think the big thing here is to me there's been you know these
[2:41:41.720 --> 2:41:46.200]  passports is the big issue here is is that you know we're hoping by doing
[2:41:46.200 --> 2:41:51.400]  this report that we can look at this this evidence and start to bring this
[2:41:51.400 --> 2:41:56.440]  into the open so perhaps people will further report this will further look
[2:41:56.440 --> 2:41:59.880]  into this and start to ask questions why isn't anybody talking about this thing
[2:41:59.880 --> 2:42:04.200]  why isn't anybody talking about you know the way these agencies are operating
[2:42:04.200 --> 2:42:08.680]  and pretty much neglecting you know the security of this country at the border
[2:42:08.680 --> 2:42:13.520]  and these guys are it's very similar to the app you know you have a passport you
[2:42:13.520 --> 2:42:17.400]  can pretty much walk over the border and come into the country you know and do
[2:42:17.400 --> 2:42:21.800]  whatever it is that you do in this country and you know it's the same thing
[2:42:21.800 --> 2:42:27.120]  with with the cognizant and the app you know if you allow it to happen then it's
[2:42:27.120 --> 2:42:30.640]  it's wide open we're being told give all our rides up his terrace for everywhere
[2:42:30.640 --> 2:42:34.440]  and they leave the doors basically wide open absolutely exactly and nobody wants
[2:42:34.440 --> 2:42:38.840]  reported because it's hurtful it's hurtful to the the image that we're
[2:42:38.840 --> 2:42:43.480]  strong and we're secure and you know I think that people should start talking
[2:42:43.480 --> 2:42:46.720]  about this thing particularly in this case where there's evidence that shows
[2:42:46.720 --> 2:42:50.760]  there's a country you know not that far away from here that's selling passports
[2:42:50.760 --> 2:42:55.360]  that you know there's been incidents of Chinese nationals of people of Middle
[2:42:55.360 --> 2:43:00.160]  Eastern descent showing up and and and showing up you know being apprehended
[2:43:00.160 --> 2:43:04.280]  and it turns out that their passports are fake and and the believes him and yet
[2:43:04.280 --> 2:43:07.800]  that it's all over Central America but here in the states we have no reports of
[2:43:07.800 --> 2:43:12.960]  that you have to you have to actually go in and dig into the old copies of
[2:43:12.960 --> 2:43:17.320]  Mexican and believes in newspapers to find instances of of Hezbollah that
[2:43:17.320 --> 2:43:22.320]  were actually arrested in Mexico with believes in passports with with European
[2:43:22.320 --> 2:43:27.480]  names Mike Smith and Terry Jones it's absurd and you're here in America do you
[2:43:27.480 --> 2:43:30.440]  read about it is it in the New York Times is it in the Wall Street Journal
[2:43:30.440 --> 2:43:34.040]  isn't in the local people here in Austin why do you think is you know you were
[2:43:34.040 --> 2:43:40.080]  nodding your head earlier John whenever I mentioned that in press TV the official
[2:43:40.080 --> 2:43:44.480]  Iranian news their chairman of their joint chiefs their head guy said we have
[2:43:44.480 --> 2:43:48.960]  sleeper cells we have asymmetrical warfare we can strike America inside
[2:43:48.960 --> 2:43:52.920]  that was an outrageous statement I didn't even get picked up in the US news
[2:43:52.920 --> 2:43:58.040]  that'd be like if our chairman of the joint chiefs Dempsey said we have sleeper
[2:43:58.040 --> 2:44:02.720]  cells in Iran we can attack you from within that would be sensational but
[2:44:02.720 --> 2:44:05.680]  they're not talking about it it's like every time there's real terror threat
[2:44:05.680 --> 2:44:09.360]  they won't discuss it if it's fake and made up it's just a constant hype that's
[2:44:09.360 --> 2:44:13.520]  what I've noticed what do you think's going on there John well I think that
[2:44:13.520 --> 2:44:17.280]  you know clearly there's a lot of issues right now with this NSA and his
[2:44:17.280 --> 2:44:21.360]  government surveillance you know they want a license to continue just to
[2:44:21.360 --> 2:44:26.320]  surveil us to to watch everything that's going on using these phones you know
[2:44:26.320 --> 2:44:31.160]  intercepting your communications your phone communications your GPS location
[2:44:31.160 --> 2:44:34.920]  and all of these things so you know we're a kind of a strange point I believe
[2:44:34.920 --> 2:44:38.680]  that where I think that you know there's not a lot of attention being paid to
[2:44:38.680 --> 2:44:43.640]  actual you know investigative you know turning you know ferreting out these
[2:44:43.640 --> 2:44:47.760]  these these operations that that could be going on right here right in
[2:44:47.760 --> 2:44:51.800]  different cities around the country you know all these different organizations
[2:44:51.800 --> 2:44:56.160]  that have infiltrated us and are here sleeper cells as you say I think that's
[2:44:56.160 --> 2:45:01.120]  a big issue we find out that the NSA is writing apps that get into our
[2:45:01.120 --> 2:45:05.640]  smartphones that listen to us and watch us and we are emails and it's sort of
[2:45:05.640 --> 2:45:10.160]  like oh gosh that's bad we don't realize what that actually means do you have any
[2:45:10.160 --> 2:45:14.520]  privacy at all if you're carrying a telephone around that that when it
[2:45:14.520 --> 2:45:18.480]  sleeps it's not really asleep the app has made it so that it's not sleeping the
[2:45:18.480 --> 2:45:23.720]  app is listening and watching and it's not just one agency it's many hundreds
[2:45:23.720 --> 2:45:27.560]  of agencies and corporations around the world even foreign even foreign
[2:45:27.560 --> 2:45:34.040]  governments are doing it Russia you know Russia will we'll go to our trade
[2:45:34.040 --> 2:45:39.280]  shows here in the states and just pass out of thumb drives and and applications
[2:45:39.280 --> 2:45:42.680]  we know for a fact that many of those are doing exactly the same thing that the
[2:45:42.680 --> 2:45:47.840]  NSA is doing we have no privacy what so well I was about to say Snowden runs over
[2:45:47.840 --> 2:45:51.840]  to Russia and I think it's fine and I think he's a hero overall but at the
[2:45:51.840 --> 2:45:57.040]  same time Russia is pioneering spying on their people real time and they're
[2:45:57.040 --> 2:46:02.360]  famous with hacking and malware and stealing the Russian mafia that's
[2:46:02.360 --> 2:46:06.320]  basically the Russian government half the time we see issues on the internet
[2:46:06.320 --> 2:46:12.960]  it's the Russians so briefly talk about your view of Snowden and the Russians
[2:46:12.960 --> 2:46:16.720]  that whole issue you know Snowden it depends on how you look at snowden he's
[2:46:16.720 --> 2:46:19.960]  certainly a hero for telling me and you and everyone else what's actually
[2:46:19.960 --> 2:46:25.000]  happening legally he is you know he's a pariah legally the US wants to
[2:46:25.000 --> 2:46:30.720]  prosecute him I'm glad that he told us quite frankly if he had not we would we
[2:46:30.720 --> 2:46:35.040]  would still be in the dark about many issues in terms of Russia Russia is
[2:46:35.040 --> 2:46:40.560]  is winning the spy war they have organized hackers that they even have
[2:46:40.560 --> 2:46:45.160]  refrigerators now that have been found that have internet connections and
[2:46:45.160 --> 2:46:50.160]  microphones in them that can listen to you this is bizarre toasters any
[2:46:50.160 --> 2:46:54.400]  electronic device that has that has a chip in it is going to be given as the
[2:46:54.400 --> 2:46:58.000]  name smart on it run from it absolutely but what are we going to do you know
[2:46:58.000 --> 2:47:03.600]  throw the refrigerators out we we need to be smarter about the situation that
[2:47:03.600 --> 2:47:07.400]  we're in it's kind of like we're you know we're being we're being swallowed by
[2:47:07.400 --> 2:47:11.360]  the snake and we're fiddling and dancing we need to be aware of what's
[2:47:11.360 --> 2:47:14.680]  happening if we're not then there is no hope is there well absolutely look at
[2:47:14.680 --> 2:47:19.000]  the Syrian electronic army which we know a lot of my Russians I mean they have
[2:47:19.000 --> 2:47:23.640]  just been hacking everything exposing everything and what's sad is Russia
[2:47:23.640 --> 2:47:26.080]  doesn't have the moral high ground they're incredibly corrupt no but then
[2:47:26.080 --> 2:47:30.280]  I look at the US government they're so bad now and so run by multinational
[2:47:30.280 --> 2:47:33.880]  corporations yes that are even more a moral in the Russians right at least the
[2:47:33.880 --> 2:47:37.880]  Russians stick up for Russians the multinational corporations don't even
[2:47:37.880 --> 2:47:42.080]  need the spy agencies anymore exactly Alex what what you're the expert talk
[2:47:42.080 --> 2:47:47.720]  about it no right they will willingly provide applications that make your life
[2:47:47.720 --> 2:47:51.960]  easier and you're glad to use and the inside those apps are the same things
[2:47:51.960 --> 2:47:55.280]  that then they say is trying to do so they don't even need the government
[2:47:55.280 --> 2:48:00.400]  anymore we are allowing them to spy on ourselves by our acquiescence it's a
[2:48:00.400 --> 2:48:04.360]  revolution against privacy and now they admit I want your take on this that
[2:48:04.360 --> 2:48:07.840]  Google can predict mass movement futures Amazon knows what you're going to order
[2:48:07.840 --> 2:48:11.600]  before yes if you know what people are doing you know the future and then you
[2:48:11.600 --> 2:48:14.680]  can manipulate people that data to control the future right now you
[2:48:14.680 --> 2:48:20.000]  mentioned Google and I'm I use Google as much as anyone however you have to
[2:48:20.000 --> 2:48:24.800]  look at the truth here Google makes money by companies knowing what you're
[2:48:24.800 --> 2:48:30.760]  doing obviously you know by by by providing companies your buying habits
[2:48:30.760 --> 2:48:35.440]  when you wake up or what you watch you wear where you work they can sell more
[2:48:35.440 --> 2:48:40.480]  stuff to you Alex and by selling more stuff to you Google gets its percentage
[2:48:40.480 --> 2:48:48.880]  Google has no interest in privacy privacy is the end of their growth so this
[2:48:48.880 --> 2:48:52.520]  is another two-edged sword we need information I need information we all
[2:48:52.520 --> 2:48:56.320]  do and we use that information it's a very powerful service but it seems to be
[2:48:56.320 --> 2:49:01.920]  a powerful service without a heart and soul while continuing with your case
[2:49:01.920 --> 2:49:07.240]  you know save you had five minutes John and you were trying to explain to say
[2:49:07.240 --> 2:49:11.560]  mainstream dinosaur media this the history of John McAvie who he is is he
[2:49:11.560 --> 2:49:16.080]  for real what's happened to him what would you say well you know I think the
[2:49:16.080 --> 2:49:20.240]  world will have to decide whether I'm for real and it's why I allowed John to
[2:49:20.240 --> 2:49:26.880]  come and spend three days pouring through a mountain of government internal
[2:49:26.880 --> 2:49:31.200]  memos for release and conversations to find you know so that so that he could
[2:49:31.200 --> 2:49:34.160]  find it for himself without me having to explain it to him yeah and the first
[2:49:34.160 --> 2:49:37.960]  time I met John you know it was in a cafe I brought a friend with me and you
[2:49:37.960 --> 2:49:42.200]  know John sort of floated into the room and there he is with a trench coat he's
[2:49:42.200 --> 2:49:47.000]  got the glasses he's looking scruffy and hat and he kind of floats into the room
[2:49:47.000 --> 2:49:50.880]  and he goes I want the chair against the wall sits against the wall turns off his
[2:49:50.880 --> 2:49:54.480]  phone we all turn off our phones and we're sitting there and he starts to
[2:49:54.480 --> 2:49:57.960]  talk and at first I wasn't even sure it was him you know because he's like looking
[2:49:57.960 --> 2:50:02.200]  around the room looking around the room you know the man was on the run I didn't
[2:50:02.200 --> 2:50:05.880]  know it then I mean what brought me into this whole thing was the value of
[2:50:05.880 --> 2:50:09.640]  decentral the value of giving people the power back to to know what's going on
[2:50:09.640 --> 2:50:13.640]  with their phones to know what's going on with their information and and the
[2:50:13.640 --> 2:50:17.440]  prospect of being decentralized so they can't track you so you can communicate
[2:50:17.440 --> 2:50:22.240]  so you can exchange things without you know you know the third big brother
[2:50:22.240 --> 2:50:26.440]  watching you know this was something that I wanted to write about and we were
[2:50:26.440 --> 2:50:30.200]  talking about we were talking about China as well we're talking about y'all
[2:50:30.200 --> 2:50:33.080]  these cyber wars going on and these different governments putting these
[2:50:33.080 --> 2:50:37.200]  things together and you know attacking corporations American corporations
[2:50:37.200 --> 2:50:40.200]  spying on American citizens and these kinds of things it was a great
[2:50:40.200 --> 2:50:43.800]  conversation and you know and then we started getting a little bit more of
[2:50:43.800 --> 2:50:48.040]  John's story about you know a little bit about what's happening stay there I
[2:50:48.040 --> 2:50:50.480]  want to hear that when we come back okay and by the way we're doing a whole hour

[2:56:15.880 --> 2:56:20.120]  finish your story about getting to know John McAfee because strange days are
[2:56:20.120 --> 2:56:24.840]  definitely here our government's trying to start war with Russia the NSA spying
[2:56:24.840 --> 2:56:30.920]  on everyone Obama wants you know to screw everybody with Obama care and we're
[2:56:30.920 --> 2:56:36.480]  hanging out with John McAfee the very interesting person yeah definitely I was
[2:56:36.480 --> 2:56:39.480]  telling the story about how I met him I was with my friend good friend Eddie
[2:56:39.480 --> 2:56:43.360]  Myers a great artist at Denver and so we went down there he's also an info set
[2:56:43.360 --> 2:56:47.520]  guy we start talking about security and we make our way outside and you know it
[2:56:47.520 --> 2:56:52.080]  was everything that we expected you know I we I talked to a John McAfee before on
[2:56:52.080 --> 2:56:58.560]  the phone and it was you know a great conversation and so we go outside and we
[2:56:58.560 --> 2:57:02.000]  start to talk and he goes hey I've got some recordings I want to play for you so
[2:57:02.000 --> 2:57:06.200]  we sit in my friend Eddie's car and he starts to play these audio recordings and
[2:57:06.200 --> 2:57:12.920]  it was an investigator who was telling John on the phone I've uncovered some
[2:57:12.920 --> 2:57:16.680]  information that says the attempt on your life that happened in Portland was a
[2:57:16.680 --> 2:57:21.800]  two million dollar contract that was put forward it was it was put into place
[2:57:21.800 --> 2:57:28.120]  through the cartel through the Suno Loa cartel and then there was a second
[2:57:28.120 --> 2:57:32.600]  contract when that attempt was not successful John's interlacing this with
[2:57:32.600 --> 2:57:36.380]  the introduction of the story at this time that all this stuff happened to him
[2:57:36.380 --> 2:57:41.400]  and Janice there was a second contract for $650,000 and John stops it and he
[2:57:41.400 --> 2:57:47.040]  goes I find that insulting that my life is only worth 650 million I mean I know
[2:57:47.040 --> 2:57:50.160]  some of the cartels that you just you know just to be grandiose have big
[2:57:50.160 --> 2:57:55.400]  contracts but that I mean 600,000 is a lot well you can get somebody killed
[2:57:55.400 --> 2:58:00.160]  for 10 grand he found he found that I'm sleeping so I understand yeah that
[2:58:00.160 --> 2:58:04.120]  leads to the deconstructing McAfee story you know everything I've ever read
[2:58:04.120 --> 2:58:08.840]  about John in the press you know it was my impression that you know John was
[2:58:08.840 --> 2:58:14.320]  this wild man he was a party man that you know preposterous if you really think
[2:58:14.320 --> 2:58:16.800]  about when you really get to know him he's not really being paranoid he's super
[2:58:16.800 --> 2:58:21.680]  smart the question is is he manipulating you yeah I thought I mean he does come

[3:00:40.560 --> 3:00:45.800]  studio with John McAvie who is very interesting person especially in person
[3:00:45.800 --> 3:00:49.560]  when you're not hanging out with him in the Hill Country shooting firearms and

[3:01:02.160 --> 3:01:05.920]  finishing your story you said it gets really interesting here you're in the
[3:01:05.920 --> 3:01:10.000]  car he's playing recordings of the investigator you know saying oh yes you
[3:01:10.000 --> 3:01:14.240]  know there was a $2 million hit the $600,000 hit on you go ahead yeah so
[3:01:14.240 --> 3:01:17.560]  yeah there were a number of calls like that that we're actually naming names
[3:01:17.560 --> 3:01:21.200]  and things like that that would come out in the report so we get out of the car
[3:01:21.200 --> 3:01:24.760]  for some fresh air right and we're standing there in the parking lot his
[3:01:24.760 --> 3:01:29.080]  phone rings John's got eight phones on him he's reaching you know all his pockets
[3:01:29.080 --> 3:01:34.080]  pulls one out finds the phone you know and he goes he decides I'm gonna put this
[3:01:34.080 --> 3:01:38.000]  on speakerphone puts it on speakerphone and it's a security guy and the
[3:01:38.000 --> 3:01:42.840]  security guy is saying yes we are gonna put bulletproof glass all in your house
[3:01:42.840 --> 3:01:47.320]  we're gonna arm the walls we've got armor going up all around your place and
[3:01:47.320 --> 3:01:51.840]  the machine guns you know will be you know should we move the carpet you know
[3:01:51.840 --> 3:01:55.280]  this whole thing and John's going yes I need this stat I need this immediately
[3:01:55.280 --> 3:01:59.240]  you know and my friend Eddie and I are looking at each other we're like is this
[3:01:59.240 --> 3:02:03.480]  even real like it just got really weird you know we're talking about something
[3:02:03.480 --> 3:02:08.040]  we're talking and then it goes into you know these contracts and now there's a
[3:02:08.040 --> 3:02:12.160]  guy that's you know arming his house who's building it up so that it can take
[3:02:12.160 --> 3:02:18.920]  on a 50 caliber weapon and then John hangs up he looks at us he goes well I'm
[3:02:18.920 --> 3:02:22.760]  ready for anyone who comes you know and you know they can shoot at me all they
[3:02:22.760 --> 3:02:28.920]  want I'm gonna be sitting there and I'll be shooting back laughing so you know we
[3:02:28.920 --> 3:02:32.080]  walk out of there thinking you know this this is really just an incredible
[3:02:32.080 --> 3:02:35.440]  situation you know what a what a personality you know how much of it is
[3:02:35.440 --> 3:02:39.000]  true I start to look into it you know there were names that were given out in
[3:02:39.000 --> 3:02:42.360]  those recordings and that's when I first started approaching John you know hey
[3:02:42.360 --> 3:02:46.840]  John I looked at this and I looked at you know these names every time somebody
[3:02:46.840 --> 3:02:51.800]  ever talks about John it's always these ridiculous stories about you know for
[3:02:51.800 --> 3:02:55.360]  some of these things to be true you would have to think that one day I'm gonna
[3:02:55.360 --> 3:03:00.320]  build a company and my ambition is to have this company sell it for a hundred
[3:03:00.320 --> 3:03:04.000]  million dollars and then I'm gonna go to the third world and set up a meth lab
[3:03:04.000 --> 3:03:07.880]  and it's pretty preposterous to think that this would be true but people are
[3:03:07.880 --> 3:03:11.920]  accepting this and articles that come out this is what they say you know no he
[3:03:11.920 --> 3:03:16.280]  was smart down there openly setting up a supplement lab which which is anybody
[3:03:16.280 --> 3:03:19.800]  that's smart that's what it's all about is that you do it yeah yeah setting up a
[3:03:19.800 --> 3:03:22.680]  meth lab in Central America by the way it's like putting a gun to your head and
[3:03:22.680 --> 3:03:26.800]  pulling the trigger you know that the car tells us that's their business you
[3:03:26.800 --> 3:03:31.000]  know a gringo doesn't go down there and start a meth lab so you know that's
[3:03:31.000 --> 3:03:35.000]  insane the bottom line is John's always gotten kind of this this rap like it's
[3:03:35.000 --> 3:03:38.640]  always this air of you know wanted for murder wanted for murder well he's never
[3:03:38.640 --> 3:03:42.760]  been officially nobody's ever said he's wanted for murder they want to ask him
[3:03:42.760 --> 3:03:45.680]  questions why because they want to bring him back down there they want him back
[3:03:45.680 --> 3:03:49.920]  down there so they can do what they're gonna do and as John reports as John
[3:03:49.920 --> 3:03:55.880]  states you know they want him gone so the attack on your life I think we should
[3:03:55.880 --> 3:04:00.200]  talk about you know Portland there was an interesting coincidence that was
[3:04:00.200 --> 3:04:04.400]  written in that article series of coincidences that happened on his body
[3:04:04.400 --> 3:04:12.840]  guard had gotten arrested and he had gotten reports from insecurity that well
[3:04:12.840 --> 3:04:15.960]  I'm going I you told me this six months ago when you were here I just you told

[3:04:34.320 --> 3:04:38.640]  that John McAfee had died of a drug overdose in the Las Vegas Hotel the
[3:04:38.640 --> 3:04:42.400]  even name the doctor not saw that stay there the 12 minute segment coming up
[3:04:42.400 --> 3:04:45.600]  you'll be able to really break it down all the pieces together you bet no no

[3:08:10.360 --> 3:08:29.200]  man we've got triple links on drugs report calm today the number one news
[3:08:29.200 --> 3:08:33.960]  aggregator in the country there's a new four-year document out homeland
[3:08:33.960 --> 3:08:39.920]  security monitors drugs report the tales of DHS media monitoring capability
[3:08:39.920 --> 3:08:43.040]  program revealed and I was really interested in this because there was a
[3:08:43.040 --> 3:08:47.480]  lawsuit with former congressman Bob Barr we're supporting for reelection
[3:08:47.480 --> 3:08:52.160]  because he was anti-nsa a long time ago and I know he's been trying to get the
[3:08:52.160 --> 3:08:56.360]  information out but this new four-year has been successful we confirm that we
[3:08:56.360 --> 3:09:01.960]  are in the other four-year from the data bar got also being spied on like
[3:09:01.960 --> 3:09:06.080]  drugs so that's a good thing folks I like DHS the fact that they want to spy
[3:09:06.080 --> 3:09:10.120]  on us it is illegal but I don't think really hide the problem is though they
[3:09:10.120 --> 3:09:14.000]  can still use that data then set me up people never think about that that
[3:09:14.000 --> 3:09:18.720]  access to my computers access to what I'm doing allows them to plant stuff so
[3:09:18.720 --> 3:09:22.120]  if you ever hear something about drudge or Alex Jones it's pure bull folks
[3:09:22.120 --> 3:09:26.080]  everybody knows me I have nothing to hide I eat too much sometimes I drink too
[3:09:26.080 --> 3:09:32.480]  much and I mean what you see on the air is what's going on basically a Tasmanian

[3:09:55.960 --> 3:10:00.720]  technology and I cover security we're John Casoretto John Casoretto and I've
[3:10:00.720 --> 3:10:06.240]  got you know our operation is some 20 25 people and growing and it's a it's a
[3:10:06.240 --> 3:10:11.800]  great operation we do live events at this thing we call the cube we got a
[3:10:11.800 --> 3:10:15.720]  number of great people that do all the work all the production it's like ESPN
[3:10:15.720 --> 3:10:18.480]  they call it we call ourselves kind of like the ESPN of tech so we'll go to like
[3:10:18.480 --> 3:10:23.400]  tech events we're number one on all these topics like crypto coins oh yeah
[3:10:23.400 --> 3:10:28.200]  no you guys are yes number one on big data and all these these great things so
[3:10:28.200 --> 3:10:32.800]  I'm following security stories all the time it's why I came to Mr. McAfee and
[3:10:32.800 --> 3:10:36.080]  you know I'm covering all the things that are coming out about you know his
[3:10:36.080 --> 3:10:39.360]  testimony and bottom line you you found him to be credible and believe his story
[3:10:39.360 --> 3:10:43.320]  absolutely verified a lot of it there comes a certain point Alex where you
[3:10:43.320 --> 3:10:46.880]  know you've got to go with your gut you know you got to go plus you've been
[3:10:46.880 --> 3:10:49.640]  privy to a lot of stuff hadn't been released absolutely there's a lot more
[3:10:49.640 --> 3:10:53.240]  that will be coming out about this in terms of it was not just your gut you
[3:10:53.240 --> 3:10:57.160]  verified a lot absolutely well that's how I got into it of course yes but I've
[3:10:57.160 --> 3:11:01.760]  I've heard so many things I mean I heard a phone call before we walked in here that
[3:11:01.760 --> 3:11:06.320]  you know he played another recording for me that was really interesting and you
[3:11:06.320 --> 3:11:11.200]  know there's there's hours of recordings spent three days with Mr. McAfee at his
[3:11:11.200 --> 3:11:16.680]  location up in the Blue Ridge Mountains remote you know secure and we went
[3:11:16.680 --> 3:11:22.560]  through tons and tons of documents shell companies 300 some companies you know
[3:11:22.560 --> 3:11:26.800]  guys switching seats like you know same three guys moving around all these
[3:11:26.800 --> 3:11:33.040]  different companies and you know all through this whole network that is you
[3:11:33.040 --> 3:11:38.200]  know requesting visas that has companies out and believes that are connected and
[3:11:38.200 --> 3:11:42.520]  are connected to this attempt on Mr. McAfee's life as he reports now what
[3:11:42.520 --> 3:11:46.240]  can you do John I mean do you release it all so they have no reason to kill you
[3:11:46.240 --> 3:11:50.720]  or then do they want to revenge killing because of it or do you say look I've
[3:11:50.720 --> 3:11:53.920]  already tried to report this the government doesn't care I'm dropping it
[3:11:53.920 --> 3:11:57.760]  I've destroyed it all you'll never hear from me again they're not gonna believe
[3:11:57.760 --> 3:12:01.520]  that last statement that I've you know you'll never hear from me again and and
[3:12:01.520 --> 3:12:05.760]  they will they will get back at me just from for revenge here's here's my
[3:12:05.760 --> 3:12:11.440]  strategy I'm I am trying to dance on a tightrope the I think the best thing I
[3:12:11.440 --> 3:12:15.240]  can do is to release just enough information to make the the public and
[3:12:15.240 --> 3:12:18.560]  the government aware of what's happening number two there are one or two two
[3:12:18.560 --> 3:12:22.720]  people who really do need to be arrested all right I intend fully to release
[3:12:22.720 --> 3:12:26.920]  everything about those individuals others perhaps the more powerful people
[3:12:26.920 --> 3:12:32.560]  than the government I have retained a lawyer who is going to to already has
[3:12:32.560 --> 3:12:38.400]  taken charge of the evidence all of the evidence all 17,000 hours of recordings
[3:12:38.400 --> 3:12:43.600]  and documents and what have you and have given the the same evidence to a
[3:12:43.600 --> 3:12:47.800]  number of other people the lawyer is in the process of writing a letter to the
[3:12:47.800 --> 3:12:52.080]  Belizean government saying if I did not hear from Mr. McAfee at by 2 p.m. every
[3:12:52.080 --> 3:12:57.240]  day with a password he has instructed me to release this full documentation to
[3:12:57.240 --> 3:13:00.840]  the press which implicates every single person within the Belizean government
[3:13:00.840 --> 3:13:07.080]  now I believe that that there they have enough common sense that they will let
[3:13:07.080 --> 3:13:11.800]  the few people that really need to be arrested the ones that you know I think
[3:13:11.800 --> 3:13:16.680]  did the most crimes against me to let that happen and I will just keep
[3:13:16.680 --> 3:13:21.360]  quiet for the rest of my life and as long as nothing happens to me nothing
[3:13:21.360 --> 3:13:25.160]  will happen to them but believe me the information that I have will bring down
[3:13:25.160 --> 3:13:29.840]  the entire Belizean government they know this and this is why they are so
[3:13:29.840 --> 3:13:34.000]  desperate to silence me it's too late to silence me the evidence is in the hands
[3:13:34.000 --> 3:13:38.120]  of other people just like I told the DC madam you have not told me any of what
[3:13:38.120 --> 3:13:41.560]  that evidence is you would just told me about one of the attempts I guess you
[3:13:41.560 --> 3:13:45.600]  were like a week after it happens yes right no now I have full evidence on
[3:13:45.600 --> 3:13:49.800]  those things which I am I've given to John what happened was the first of all
[3:13:49.800 --> 3:13:53.520]  the first clue and I should have occurred to me at that time was there was a
[3:13:53.520 --> 3:13:58.360]  report of my death okay John Macby died of a drug overdose I got a call at 8
[3:13:58.360 --> 3:14:02.760]  o'clock in the morning from a friend and they were in tears and I go what and it
[3:14:02.760 --> 3:14:07.600]  went it just went all over the net it was weird I put out a tweet saying not
[3:14:07.600 --> 3:14:10.920]  true in fact you know I woke up feeling fine or I went to bed feeling fine
[3:14:10.920 --> 3:14:14.920]  rumors of my death have been greatly exaggerated really exaggerated within
[3:14:14.920 --> 3:14:20.560]  within 12 hours my security guards get arrested mysteriously 12 hours later at
[3:14:20.560 --> 3:14:25.000]  2.15 in the morning on the 12th of September in when I was up because I
[3:14:25.000 --> 3:14:29.380]  was anticipating I again I have contacts still within the government I was
[3:14:29.380 --> 3:14:33.160]  anticipating I didn't know the exact date but I knew it was coming soon I was up
[3:14:33.160 --> 3:14:37.200]  and watching at 2.15 two police motorcycles now this is at night where
[3:14:37.200 --> 3:14:41.320]  where the police do not really use their motorcycles after dark two police
[3:14:41.320 --> 3:14:44.960]  motorcycles followed by a sedan full of plainclothes people followed by a
[3:14:44.960 --> 3:14:48.760]  garbage truck the compressor the compressing variety they're gonna put
[3:14:48.760 --> 3:14:52.600]  you in that maybe I have no clue but they pulled up right in front of my condo
[3:14:52.600 --> 3:14:56.040]  and there is no back exit there is only one exit and that is through the front
[3:14:56.040 --> 3:15:00.880]  I ran and I grabbed my wife we ran downstairs to the garage I wanted to
[3:15:00.880 --> 3:15:04.800]  hide in the trash bins the big the big things thinking maybe we'd be safe my
[3:15:04.800 --> 3:15:09.920]  wife refused so we climbed it's we have in the in the condo was a stacking a
[3:15:09.920 --> 3:15:13.240]  car stacking elevator where you drive your car in it puts it on the second
[3:15:13.240 --> 3:15:16.840]  floor and then you drive others in up and down we climbed up on the second
[3:15:16.840 --> 3:15:22.120]  floor hid under a car both of us together for five hours we were not under
[3:15:22.120 --> 3:15:25.640]  there for for a minute before we heard the running up and down the stairs and
[3:15:25.640 --> 3:15:29.760]  excited voices and then they came into the into the garage but very stealthily
[3:15:29.760 --> 3:15:35.400]  they they looked into the the of the garbage room you know I remember to be
[3:15:35.400 --> 3:15:39.920]  armed and dangerous and I think they didn't want to just open the thing they
[3:15:39.920 --> 3:15:44.280]  were talking we could hear them talking and they were there for about an hour
[3:15:44.280 --> 3:15:49.520]  before the garage truck came in the garage you I mean the garbage the
[3:15:49.520 --> 3:15:54.640]  garbage truck came into the garage they rolled the bins that lifted up dumped it
[3:15:54.640 --> 3:16:00.480]  compressed it both bins and drove off we were we waited two hours till after
[3:16:00.480 --> 3:16:03.800]  everybody had gone we ran and got our things and we left and we haven't been
[3:16:03.800 --> 3:16:12.720]  back why not lay and wait with a salt rifle and might have been cops but
[3:16:12.720 --> 3:16:16.440]  they're coming to kill you we couldn't maybe in real cops okay that's what you
[3:16:16.440 --> 3:16:19.120]  told me right after it happened you said could not have been cops with a warrant
[3:16:19.120 --> 3:16:23.400]  how did you know yeah I didn't but cops of the warrant say warrant yeah cops for
[3:16:23.400 --> 3:16:27.600]  the warrant do not try to compress you in a garbage truck and you don't show up
[3:16:27.600 --> 3:16:31.800]  at 2 15 in the morning and that garbage day either it was not garbage today they
[3:16:31.800 --> 3:16:34.440]  didn't get everybody else's garbage they didn't get it yes so it was not
[3:16:34.440 --> 3:16:37.600]  garbage day and then I gotta say that does sound like how those hits work
[3:16:37.600 --> 3:16:41.280]  and that's why you'd need two million is they wanted all official covered up
[3:16:41.280 --> 3:16:44.640]  right you hire the cops and the reason and the reason that there was you know
[3:16:44.640 --> 3:16:48.120]  you can't get the cops to take part in a hit in every city I know you can in
[3:16:48.120 --> 3:16:52.440]  Houston I think you can in every city well well they got cops that kill
[3:16:52.440 --> 3:16:55.360]  people in most big cities right they usually work for organized crime is
[3:16:55.360 --> 3:16:58.840]  saying not every city has the police chief being part of it all right well I
[3:16:58.840 --> 3:17:01.760]  don't think the police chief was part of this but but certainly the cops were part
[3:17:01.760 --> 3:17:04.800]  of these were legitimate cops on the legitimate motor sure sure all right well
[3:17:04.800 --> 3:17:08.200]  you know the most hit man or cops I mean it's been a major city that is true
[3:17:08.200 --> 3:17:12.040]  yeah what I'm saying I think it almost all cities you get you find this but
[3:17:12.040 --> 3:17:15.880]  general public doesn't I think I think the reason that they put out a report
[3:17:15.880 --> 3:17:19.560]  that I was a dead is so that everybody's going oh my god Maccabee died and it
[3:17:19.560 --> 3:17:23.600]  makes this now that's not true so if Maccabee does disappear the next day no
[3:17:23.600 --> 3:17:26.240]  big deal and I don't pay much attention no that's how they do it is creates
[3:17:26.240 --> 3:17:29.520]  confusion creates confusion and therefore people won't pay much mind to it
[3:17:29.520 --> 3:17:32.960]  because really if I were just to disappear out of the clear blue sky people
[3:17:32.960 --> 3:17:36.760]  gonna talk it's the day before there was a there was a big article saying I had
[3:17:36.760 --> 3:17:39.880]  died and of a drug over there you're really smart I mean obviously you're a
[3:17:39.880 --> 3:17:43.960]  smart guy I've been told by high-level army officers that when I that when I
[3:17:43.960 --> 3:17:47.480]  see these stories that I've been killed or disappeared that's when I've got to
[3:17:47.480 --> 3:17:50.160]  be careful because they'll do that right before they disappear me you've
[3:17:50.160 --> 3:17:53.520]  actually heard that oh yeah seriously I've had family that worked in black
[3:17:53.520 --> 3:17:57.600]  ops I just I just and in the muscle end of things and they told me that no one
[3:17:57.600 --> 3:18:02.760]  told me I just figured it out really well there's some verification oh no
[3:18:02.760 --> 3:18:05.760]  that's definitely review as much as you can believe me no no that's true that's
[3:18:05.760 --> 3:18:09.920]  true yeah I think a big thing is how did this all come together and one of the
[3:18:09.920 --> 3:18:14.920]  interesting coincidence is that that John is reported you can check this out the
[3:18:14.920 --> 3:18:19.600]  the country of Belize for the first time in that country's history traveled
[3:18:19.600 --> 3:18:25.360]  abroad to what city Portland where John McAfee is living to play soccer to play
[3:18:25.360 --> 3:18:29.320]  soccer in a soccer game and the team is like you know part-time carpenters
[3:18:29.320 --> 3:18:33.360]  yeah there's not even a real team yeah they lost to the US 6 to nothing they
[3:18:33.360 --> 3:18:37.880]  had no chance at all I think it was 6 to 1 and this is the first time now why
[3:18:37.880 --> 3:18:42.360]  would they come to Portland Oregon where I'm living get real and this was two
[3:18:42.360 --> 3:18:47.320]  months before the hit or the attempted hit classic double down as an
[3:18:47.320 --> 3:18:51.600]  investigation but call of the soccer game yeah I know where he lives now that's
[3:18:51.600 --> 3:18:56.560]  that you it's hard but people go no they didn't go to Portland check it on the
[3:18:56.560 --> 3:19:00.840]  internet again again again that is speculation undoubtedly though them
[3:19:00.840 --> 3:19:04.080]  coming to your these people that came to your place that that is amazing yes
[3:19:04.080 --> 3:19:08.680]  absolutely and now you're an armored redoubt I am I am in a location where
[3:19:08.680 --> 3:19:15.880]  I can guarantee you no one is going to get close to me so and I am I am angry
[3:19:15.880 --> 3:19:21.360]  I've stopped being afraid I'm not afraid anymore I am pissed off I am seriously
[3:19:21.360 --> 3:19:23.760]  yeah last time you were here you had a pretty serious guy when you're going
[3:19:23.760 --> 3:19:27.000]  around with you everywhere yeah well I've got a whole bunch of serious people
[3:19:27.000 --> 3:19:31.240]  around me now and and they are serious people and I'm serious myself I am I
[3:19:31.240 --> 3:19:36.480]  swear I am pissed off just come for me that's the attitude I have I know that's
[3:19:36.480 --> 3:19:40.280]  nonsense and I know that's my attitude so hell that's the only attitude you got
[3:19:40.280 --> 3:19:44.840]  ahead in life the one else can you have because I am seriously pissed and I'm

[3:33:13.760 --> 3:33:17.400]  hey guys before I forget John McAfee's here with us ladies and gentlemen any
[3:33:17.400 --> 3:33:20.880]  websites Twitter accounts Facebook's anything you want to plug anything you
[3:33:20.880 --> 3:33:24.400]  want to say that you've forgotten to say before we answer the question about the
[3:33:24.400 --> 3:33:28.040]  missing Malaysian flight it's the big mystery right now and then go back to
[3:33:28.040 --> 3:33:34.080]  phone calls all right well I what I want to say is everybody out there take
[3:33:34.080 --> 3:33:38.240]  responsibility for the for the technology that you own and realize that
[3:33:38.240 --> 3:33:42.080]  the risks that you are putting yourself under by by not being aware of all of
[3:33:42.080 --> 3:33:47.440]  these risks so download the cognizant app running on your phone you're going
[3:33:47.440 --> 3:33:52.680]  to be shocked at what you find out I can't wait because I already know what's
[3:33:52.680 --> 3:33:55.320]  running on it it's incredible but I guess it's all right there and I've seen
[3:33:55.320 --> 3:33:59.760]  reviews people have seen it it shows everything right there in real time so
[3:33:59.760 --> 3:34:02.800]  it's just like your antivirus software would show you the viruses this shows
[3:34:02.800 --> 3:34:07.320]  you all the spy links and yeah yeah what it does it's not a real time you run it
[3:34:07.320 --> 3:34:10.440]  and it will tell you which of your applications are doing what you get to
[3:34:10.440 --> 3:34:14.240]  choose at that moment don't let it you don't have to wait for them to to
[3:34:14.240 --> 3:34:18.440]  actually be spying on you oh it tells you what they do it's like a scan yeah
[3:34:18.440 --> 3:34:21.600]  tells you what to do before they do it and then you can choose at that point to
[3:34:21.600 --> 3:34:25.400]  that way don't to read 20-page contract and find the fine print written in
[3:34:25.400 --> 3:34:29.280]  Martian absolutely to explain what they're doing yeah and John's like a
[3:34:29.280 --> 3:34:34.520]  forefather of giving away software and then you know claiming it on on the
[3:34:34.520 --> 3:34:38.440]  back monetizing that on the back end so you know it's a lot of things that he
[3:34:38.440 --> 3:34:43.040]  invented antivirus but he's also you know invented basically the way
[3:34:43.040 --> 3:34:47.120]  everybody does with these yeah what do you think of Dr. Stallman and his free
[3:34:47.120 --> 3:34:52.160]  software movement but you know Dr. Solomon is a nice British gentleman and he
[3:34:52.160 --> 3:34:57.200]  we're talking about Dr. Solomon and he's not a Solomon Stahlman we had him on the
[3:34:57.200 --> 3:35:01.600]  other day you know the Genu guy yeah yeah Richard Stallman I think he's a very
[3:35:01.600 --> 3:35:04.520]  nice guy yeah yeah but I mean he's into the free software go ahead yes same
[3:35:04.520 --> 3:35:09.360]  thing so yeah so I basically invented to give the software away for free and
[3:35:09.360 --> 3:35:12.800]  and almost everybody does that now although most of it's not really free
[3:35:12.800 --> 3:35:17.680]  you get to use it per month and then they shut it down but I believe that that
[3:35:17.680 --> 3:35:21.120]  that once people see the value of something down the road maybe they'll
[3:35:21.120 --> 3:35:24.080]  just pay for maintenance or they'll buy the next product that you come out the
[3:35:24.080 --> 3:35:28.520]  door with so you know I'm not I'm not out to make a fortune right now I never
[3:35:28.520 --> 3:35:32.680]  did that on purpose I wanted my films to be seen I wanted to prove the things I
[3:35:32.680 --> 3:35:35.960]  was saying another talk show has to add a coffee cup or a newsletter they had to
[3:35:35.960 --> 3:35:39.920]  make money and pay their bills and have a crew I made documentaries which
[3:35:39.920 --> 3:35:43.560]  probably aren't the best in the world production wise but content it's good
[3:35:43.560 --> 3:35:48.280]  info and I would let people copy him when nobody else would and that and that
[3:35:48.280 --> 3:35:52.760]  built a huge listenership absolutely and I wasn't doing it on purpose then
[3:35:52.760 --> 3:35:56.520]  later like branders and marketers went look at his genius plan to get everybody
[3:35:56.520 --> 3:36:00.360]  early and I was just doing the right thing you were stumbled into it your
[3:36:00.360 --> 3:36:02.480]  hearts that you're falling in your heart if you follow your heart you're gonna
[3:36:02.480 --> 3:36:06.400]  make money this is a fact see I want to have a conversation with you about that
[3:36:06.400 --> 3:36:11.260]  because you're a really interesting guy I mean what makes you tick British
[3:36:11.260 --> 3:36:15.280]  father American mother writer was advice versa no no it's America the American
[3:36:15.280 --> 3:36:18.800]  father British mother my father was an American soldier during the war that's
[3:36:18.800 --> 3:36:21.120]  right and then came back to the Appalachians that's where you grew up that's
[3:36:21.120 --> 3:36:24.760]  where I grew up yeah I'm not sure what makes me tick I care about people I care
[3:36:24.760 --> 3:36:29.560]  about relationships you know I love a lot you know and if you love you get
[3:36:29.560 --> 3:36:33.680]  hurt and I'm willing to risk all those things that's right but I feel sorry for
[3:36:33.680 --> 3:36:37.840]  all those cold-blooded people that are sociopaths and they think they're so
[3:36:37.840 --> 3:36:41.840]  cool because they don't have any heart but they're totally unfulfilled people
[3:36:41.840 --> 3:36:47.400]  I agree fully and the world is full of sociopaths now because people spend all
[3:36:47.400 --> 3:36:51.320]  of the time connecting with their their smartphones and there I've seen people
[3:36:51.320 --> 3:36:55.600]  text each other at the same table you know it's like it's insane you're right
[3:36:55.600 --> 3:36:59.840]  it's a fact I was reading a study on that it's artificially making people more
[3:36:59.840 --> 3:37:04.240]  sociopathic and more isolated artificially because you're pretty much
[3:37:04.240 --> 3:37:08.800]  born a sociopathic thing this is artificially making people dehumanized
[3:37:08.800 --> 3:37:12.360]  you're a tech guy what do you think of that John well yeah I think that's one
[3:37:12.360 --> 3:37:15.560]  of the things I mean we've had some conversations at John was actually at
[3:37:15.560 --> 3:37:20.000]  this conversation we were talking to a guy who was pretty deep in some of these
[3:37:20.000 --> 3:37:25.840]  operations government operations and he was talking about you know at some point
[3:37:25.840 --> 3:37:31.800]  we're gonna have to to come back to a nonverbal form of communication because
[3:37:31.800 --> 3:37:34.440]  they can intercept everything they're they're intercepting you know
[3:37:34.440 --> 3:37:38.440]  conversations they can pick it up in the streets when you're walking around you
[3:37:38.440 --> 3:37:42.760]  know people are gonna have to figure out a way to get back the basics when as
[3:37:42.760 --> 3:37:48.720]  they say SHTF right you know how can can people take their their privacy back
[3:37:48.720 --> 3:37:51.640]  take their freedom back you know and and that's what that's one of the things
[3:37:51.640 --> 3:37:55.080]  that we talked about at that point and I think that you know we're becoming very
[3:37:55.080 --> 3:37:58.720]  dependent on these technology devices I use it I certainly enjoy it's kind of
[3:37:58.720 --> 3:38:02.120]  like you know this this balance it's like the Borg are assimilating us yeah
[3:38:02.120 --> 3:38:05.640]  they're just rolling it out we're accepting it and it's becoming ubiquitous
[3:38:05.640 --> 3:38:09.840]  yeah well my phone tells me hey it's time to leave for your flight you know this
[3:38:09.840 --> 3:38:13.320]  is when you have to leave to make it it's time to take protein shake yeah it's
[3:38:13.320 --> 3:38:16.280]  assigned to make a left turn here so that we're not even aware of where well
[3:38:16.280 --> 3:38:19.440]  it's all my crew that knows how to really use all this stuff and so they're
[3:38:19.440 --> 3:38:22.680]  trying to get me in shape and stuff so it's like 730 time for protein shake
[3:38:22.680 --> 3:38:26.280]  hey time for workout and they're all feeding me dad and it's like being being
[3:38:26.280 --> 3:38:29.760]  being being it's like I like it and I hate it because you come dependent on it
[3:38:29.760 --> 3:38:33.080]  right I mean I remember when I first you know would probably I mean I forgot I
[3:38:33.080 --> 3:38:36.360]  don't even know any big phone numbers it's all in my Google contacts oh used to
[3:38:36.360 --> 3:38:40.400]  I could memorize numbers yes you so I could do math in my brain now I
[3:38:40.400 --> 3:38:43.320]  literally can't do math I'd use the calculator I don't even know my own
[3:38:43.320 --> 3:38:47.200]  phone numbers this is a fact you know and that that's how tragic it's become
[3:38:47.200 --> 3:38:52.000]  yeah we are we are Borgs without without the metal implants we carry we carry the
[3:38:52.000 --> 3:38:56.000]  implant in our hat well that's coming all right exactly I gotta talk about some
[3:38:56.000 --> 3:39:00.120]  news breaking on drudgereport.com showdown Kerry gives Russia Monday
[3:39:00.120 --> 3:39:05.000]  deadline and the Ukrainians are asking NATO to basically attack the Russians
[3:39:05.000 --> 3:39:09.480]  the Russians are massing troops on the border the chairman of the joint chief
[3:39:09.480 --> 3:39:13.720]  said they're prepared to military respond this is crazy town what war is
[3:39:13.720 --> 3:39:20.040]  money Alex yeah there's money it's how it's how we it's how we jump ahead
[3:39:20.040 --> 3:39:23.800]  rapidly through war and then look at this hundred even creepier homeland
[3:39:23.800 --> 3:39:29.160]  monitors drudgereport details of DHS media monitoring capability program
[3:39:29.160 --> 3:39:32.200]  revealed newly obtained document revealed of the freedom information act
[3:39:32.200 --> 3:39:36.040]  confirms Department of Homeland Security keeps tabs on drudgereport as part of
[3:39:36.040 --> 3:39:40.800]  its media monitoring program it's worse than that folks we have documents and
[3:39:40.800 --> 3:39:43.240]  that's why they've sued to get them to get the full documents that they're
[3:39:43.240 --> 3:39:49.120]  spying directly and and in telling TSA you know to basically that this is a
[3:39:49.120 --> 3:39:53.560]  threat the drudgereports evil and then I'm evil but it shows that they're not
[3:39:53.560 --> 3:39:57.040]  as powerful as people think they are if they're scared of news websites right
[3:39:57.040 --> 3:40:01.760]  absolutely information is power it is power and the more information we have
[3:40:01.760 --> 3:40:06.560]  the more powerful would become how powerful did we become when we found out
[3:40:06.560 --> 3:40:10.400]  that the NSA was spying we became very powerful very but because we became
[3:40:10.400 --> 3:40:15.160]  pissed off we became frightened and and no one wants that people want the the
[3:40:15.160 --> 3:40:19.000]  of the populace to be at ease and sedate while they roll over that's it
[3:40:19.000 --> 3:40:23.360]  basically it and so when we when we stop being sedated they panic this is the
[3:40:23.360 --> 3:40:26.960]  fact that's the name of the game they want to sedate us they want to calm us
[3:40:26.960 --> 3:40:30.720]  so we just quietly slip off in an everland gentlemen I want to get into
[3:40:30.720 --> 3:40:33.880]  that question what do you think is going with this Malaysian flight it's like five
[3:40:33.880 --> 3:40:37.800]  days or whatever it's been missing six days what's going on here well either
[3:40:37.800 --> 3:40:40.960]  it was picked up by a flying saucer which I doubt very seriously or there
[3:40:40.960 --> 3:40:43.800]  there's something nefarious going on I believe we're gonna find out that there
[3:40:43.800 --> 3:40:48.920]  is criminal activity involved possibly a hijacking remember when the Chinese
[3:40:48.920 --> 3:40:52.760]  forced down that AWAC to steal its technology absolutely absolutely a lot
[3:40:52.760 --> 3:40:55.640]  of top tech people on the plane what do you think yeah what was on that
[3:40:55.640 --> 3:41:00.240]  yeah what was on the plane the bunch of top tech people number one so either it
[3:41:00.240 --> 3:41:05.680]  went down and someone benefited or maybe it's innocuous maybe it just had had a
[3:41:05.680 --> 3:41:11.240]  mechanical error however why would it be changing directions this is the issue my
[3:41:11.240 --> 3:41:15.000]  gut tells me it's either a hijacking or a government remote control that which
[3:41:15.000 --> 3:41:19.280]  they admit are on those planes and landed it as a tech heist could be could
[3:41:19.280 --> 3:41:23.560]  be I do believe there's criminal activity I think that will that will you
[3:41:23.560 --> 3:41:26.480]  know that's another thing we can test McAfee and his intuition or his
[3:41:26.480 --> 3:41:30.040]  information well that's the Chinese did that with the AWAC that time absolutely
[3:41:30.040 --> 3:41:33.360]  and this plane's flying by China and it just disappears absolutely there was like
[3:41:33.360 --> 3:41:37.200]  fake passports and stuff involved too yes seen a couple stories around back to
[3:41:37.200 --> 3:41:41.160]  fake passports back to fake passports and you said South Korea and that's South
[3:41:41.160 --> 3:41:45.880]  Korea absolutely that was the most South Korea and the Middle East that is
[3:41:45.880 --> 3:41:50.000]  that is where that is where a police makes most of its money off of the
[3:41:50.000 --> 3:41:54.240]  issuing of new identities and fake passports and you got those Iranians
[3:41:54.240 --> 3:41:58.160]  thrown in the mix absolutely well that's Middle Eastern again that was the
[3:41:58.160 --> 3:42:01.920]  same deal but on the plane I just meanwhile while we're worried about that
[3:42:01.920 --> 3:42:06.040]  I mean literally they're not crazy enough to actually start a war with Russia
[3:42:06.040 --> 3:42:10.920]  are they why not I mean you know why let them get more powerful that might be
[3:42:10.920 --> 3:42:17.760]  some thinking again I am I'm an adamant opponent of war however the the the
[3:42:17.760 --> 3:42:23.120]  military-industrial complex cannot survive without it think about it and I
[3:42:23.120 --> 3:42:26.560]  guess they're saying al-Qaeda is not the threat that's a new ally in Syria so they
[3:42:26.560 --> 3:42:30.680]  say domestic groups and the Russians are the new enemy and I and who are the
[3:42:30.680 --> 3:42:35.000]  domestic groups you and I yeah they say libertarians running veterans gun owners
[3:42:35.000 --> 3:42:39.280]  basically old-fashioned men and women I mean just people that don't want to be
[3:42:39.280 --> 3:42:45.400]  total slaves we're bad well I guess we had John McAfee I'm as bad as I get
[3:42:45.400 --> 3:42:49.400]  both of us tell me he's bad bad bad bad we just call me Satan earlier like
[3:42:49.400 --> 3:42:55.640]  that I was just joking no no no you do I literally it just clicked earlier the
[3:42:55.640 --> 3:43:00.520]  archetypal handsome devil pops up when you look at John McAfee I'm sure you've
[3:43:00.520 --> 3:43:04.320]  heard that before I have yes yeah I mean no no if I was a Hollywood Central
[3:43:04.320 --> 3:43:09.240]  Caster and I was gonna come up with the devil it would be John McAfee but he's
[3:43:09.240 --> 3:43:11.720]  not actually a devil because he folks the devil doesn't really look like the
[3:43:11.720 --> 3:43:19.120]  devil looks in Hollywood the devil looks more like oh Hillary Clinton no I've
[3:43:19.120 --> 3:43:22.920]  noticed it more innocuous the devil doesn't actually show up looking like
[3:43:22.920 --> 3:43:28.080]  the archetypal handsome devil the devil shows up like a nice little old lady who
[3:43:28.080 --> 3:43:32.480]  wants the moral high-grounded oh sonny can you help me can you let me run your
[3:43:32.480 --> 3:43:35.920]  life or you're a bad man the devil tells you you're racist if you don't turn your
[3:43:35.920 --> 3:43:40.360]  guns in the devil accuses you and tells you you shouldn't have freedom and then
[3:43:40.360 --> 3:43:43.160]  all these movies twisted to say the devil wants to give you freedom like
[3:43:43.160 --> 3:43:48.000]  like like Al Pacino's devil's advocate I want to empower humanity I'm a fan of
[3:43:48.000 --> 3:43:54.000]  humanity BS BS the devil wants to enslave not empower well if the devil
[3:43:54.000 --> 3:43:57.400]  looks like the devil we would not get close enough to become ensnared would
[3:43:57.400 --> 3:44:02.520]  be exactly exactly there you go ladies and gentlemen very very clear let's talk
[3:44:02.520 --> 3:44:07.120]  to Peter in New York Peter you're on here go ahead wow it's a it's a thrill
[3:44:07.120 --> 3:44:12.760]  to be a participate in your discussion here I am a little bit I have a problem
[3:44:12.760 --> 3:44:18.840]  with Mr. McAfee's sort of demonization of Hezbollah I think it's far more
[3:44:18.840 --> 3:44:23.280]  likely that the British are up to shenanigans there and believes than
[3:44:23.280 --> 3:44:29.040]  Hezbollah Hezbollah it's a it's a it's a resistance movement engaged in national
[3:44:29.040 --> 3:44:32.600]  defense they do not come over to the Western Hemisphere let me stop you let
[3:44:32.600 --> 3:44:34.800]  me stop you sir because I'm gonna say something that I want John to say
[3:44:34.800 --> 3:44:39.320]  something I'm not anti-Iran they invite me on Iranian TV every week and I'm too
[3:44:39.320 --> 3:44:43.320]  busy to do it national TV television okay let me explain something I'm against
[3:44:43.320 --> 3:44:47.080]  attacking Iran I want Iran to be able to have power and be able to have
[3:44:47.080 --> 3:44:50.440]  refineries and be able to have a good culture okay but the head of the
[3:44:50.440 --> 3:44:55.880]  Iranian military said we have asymmetrical warfare capability in the
[3:44:55.880 --> 3:45:00.880]  U.S. sleeper cells so he made that threat and I have changed my stance
[3:45:00.880 --> 3:45:04.360]  towards Iran a lot with those type of statements coming out because I don't
[3:45:04.360 --> 3:45:07.480]  want to have World War three the Iranian government stands to gain from
[3:45:07.480 --> 3:45:11.040]  conflict just like the Russians Putin's gonna get more powerful out of the West
[3:45:11.040 --> 3:45:15.440]  messing with them I don't want war I'm not saying Putin's good or the U.S. is
[3:45:15.440 --> 3:45:19.720]  good or Iran's good these governments all tend to act the same John okay in
[3:45:19.720 --> 3:45:24.000]  terms of the you don't believe the Hezbollah thing there are documented
[3:45:24.000 --> 3:45:28.440]  reports in newspapers throughout Mexico and beliefs of Hezbollah agents being
[3:45:28.440 --> 3:45:33.520]  arrested with Belizean passport what does he say about the Iranian military
[3:45:33.520 --> 3:45:37.240]  commander their joint chiefs of staff chairman saying we have sleeper cells are
[3:45:37.240 --> 3:45:44.320]  you denying that I'm saying Hezbollah is strictly a resistant no I know Hezbollah
[3:45:44.320 --> 3:45:49.720]  is their their their militia armies in Lebanon in places I understand that it's
[3:45:49.720 --> 3:45:54.440]  engaged in a national defensive it's not an offensive force it's strictly
[3:45:54.440 --> 3:45:57.640]  defense well when they arrested them they had Hezbollah literature and stuff
[3:45:57.640 --> 3:46:01.920]  but I mean obviously they were well known Hezbollah agents and and if you
[3:46:01.920 --> 3:46:06.120]  want to go and Google it simply Google Hezbollah Belizean listen if I'm gonna
[3:46:06.120 --> 3:46:12.280]  infiltrate the U.S. I'm not gonna send regular army I'm gonna send underground
[3:46:12.280 --> 3:46:15.400]  commandos that's the kind of people that know how to infiltrate people have been
[3:46:15.400 --> 3:46:19.400]  fighting and beating the Israelis in Lebanon I'm not gonna send a regular
[3:46:19.400 --> 3:46:24.160]  Iranian army officer so again I'm not gonna argue one way or the other I'm
[3:46:24.160 --> 3:46:28.800]  just saying Google it yourself find out the truth yourself I mean I can tell
[3:46:28.800 --> 3:46:32.720]  you're not an entire Iranian are you absolutely not I'm not anti any any
[3:46:32.720 --> 3:46:37.560]  generic thing I am anti what's happening to me
[3:46:37.560 --> 3:46:45.520]  station of Hezbollah it's a red flag for me this is not right okay well I mean
[3:46:45.520 --> 3:46:48.800]  I'm just telling you if I was an Iranian general that's who I would send I mean
[3:46:48.800 --> 3:46:54.320]  the Iranian general said we have sleeper cells in your country again just
[3:46:54.320 --> 3:46:58.040]  Google it sir and and if I am wrong I will eat my shoe on television right
[3:46:58.040 --> 3:47:01.800]  here well there's news 5 who helped Hezbollah terrorists get Benghazi passport
[3:47:01.800 --> 3:47:06.560]  night ease police the Belizean believes in there it is that's one of them so
[3:47:06.560 --> 3:47:10.880]  trust me it's happening I have heard it I have documentation ahead of their
[3:47:10.880 --> 3:47:16.920]  military Senate on I on Iranian State TV now it may be wrong and maybe hard to
[3:47:16.920 --> 3:47:21.080]  believe but unfortunately it's very hard even for me to believe what's actually
[3:47:21.080 --> 3:47:25.200]  happened to me in my life my life is so crazy and so weird I don't tell people
[3:47:25.200 --> 3:47:29.800]  half of it people wouldn't believe it truth is stranger than fiction I agree
[3:47:29.800 --> 3:47:34.080]  my truth is that's for sure oh man I tell you Peter listen we're not your
[3:47:34.080 --> 3:47:37.440]  enemy buddy but I mean did you see the report where the head of the Iranian
[3:47:37.440 --> 3:47:43.200]  military said we have asymmetrical grips in your country I don't believe that I'm
[3:47:43.200 --> 3:47:46.920]  sorry would you believe the pet the photograph of the passport this way we
[3:47:46.920 --> 3:47:50.880]  that we hold on sir sir sir this is on press TV guys put it on screen I want to
[3:47:50.880 --> 3:47:57.320]  give them the headline if you can find that thanks whatever whatever I appreciate
[3:47:57.320 --> 3:48:00.760]  your call I am people call me still and go I don't believe they have goats that
[3:48:00.760 --> 3:48:04.960]  are part spiders that produce armored milk I mean that's been out for 15 years
[3:48:04.960 --> 3:48:09.880]  it just they just do not believe us I just do not understand it Stephanie and
[3:48:09.880 --> 3:48:15.600]  Iowa you're on the air with John McAvian company go ahead hi thanks for doing
[3:48:15.600 --> 3:48:20.480]  everything that you do appreciate getting on first-time caller I do have a
[3:48:20.480 --> 3:48:26.560]  question about the app I don't know I got into the conversation late so the app
[3:48:26.560 --> 3:48:30.960]  is coming out when it should be out in five days in five days and you just get
[3:48:30.960 --> 3:48:35.400]  it from Google Play Google absolutely it's totally free okay perfect and then
[3:48:35.400 --> 3:48:39.480]  exactly like I don't have smartphones that I actually use they don't have
[3:48:39.480 --> 3:48:43.000]  service or anything so I'm just scared that they're still taking still pictures
[3:48:43.000 --> 3:48:48.160]  or they can listen into conversations well it'll let me know all that stuff if
[3:48:48.160 --> 3:48:51.760]  you don't have a smartphone you don't have much to worry about if you have an
[3:48:51.760 --> 3:48:56.920]  Android phone then you definitely need to run this app Android phone but no
[3:48:56.920 --> 3:49:01.280]  service on it and there's an iPhone that no service on it and tablets and well
[3:49:01.280 --> 3:49:06.400]  that may that may be a blessing in disguise okay perfect and then I have a
[3:49:06.400 --> 3:49:13.240]  question on or comment about that the plane I think that they were flying in
[3:49:13.240 --> 3:49:18.520]  the radar at like under 3,000 feet or 3,000 feet and there weren't somebody
[3:49:18.520 --> 3:49:23.040]  another country is probably wanting something on that plane oh yeah that's
[3:49:23.040 --> 3:49:27.520]  entirely that's entirely possible yeah and you can see like I watched the news
[3:49:27.520 --> 3:49:31.360]  I'm like I can see right through their lives and they'll never say anything like
[3:49:31.360 --> 3:49:34.680]  that well if they knew some government was involved they may be diplomatically
[3:49:34.680 --> 3:49:37.840]  deciding what to do like Benghazi appreciate your call great questions
[3:49:37.840 --> 3:49:41.720]  great points Paul in Connecticut we're moving quick now go ahead Paul you're on
[3:49:41.720 --> 3:49:46.240]  the air hi John how you doing I'm doing good Paul oh look I was told by an old
[3:49:46.240 --> 3:49:50.880]  OSS guy that you got your start at McAfee by actually creating the viruses
[3:49:50.880 --> 3:49:55.520]  and then having that software there to solve it so kind of like a hig alien
[3:49:55.520 --> 3:49:59.120]  create the problem have the solution ready if that's true and I'd love to
[3:49:59.120 --> 3:50:02.640]  hear I can't believe I'm actually talking to you guys your response to that but if
[3:50:02.640 --> 3:50:06.160]  that's true I mean I would be suspect to this new software that you have will
[3:50:06.160 --> 3:50:10.760]  your code be open for everyone to look at well we're not we're not we're not
[3:50:10.760 --> 3:50:14.520]  putting out source code we're putting out an app you're free to disassemble it
[3:50:14.520 --> 3:50:18.680]  and look at it yourself if you wish but but think about it there were at the
[3:50:18.680 --> 3:50:24.360]  time thousands of computer viruses why would I spend months or have my team
[3:50:24.360 --> 3:50:27.240]  spend my would you build a fish hatchery when you got plenty of fish right
[3:50:27.240 --> 3:50:30.080]  you got we got more fish than you can possibly deal with we could barely keep
[3:50:30.080 --> 3:50:32.880]  up with the viruses that were out there so we certainly had no time to build
[3:50:32.880 --> 3:50:37.680]  new ones and that would be senseless and hey skip this network break skip this
[3:50:37.680 --> 3:50:40.920]  network break go ahead okay it would just be a senseless thing to do so I can
[3:50:40.920 --> 3:50:45.200]  categorically say and and you can talk to any of the McAfee employees that were
[3:50:45.200 --> 3:50:48.880]  there at the time that thought never crossed but see that's those rumors I
[3:50:48.880 --> 3:50:53.360]  always love it like there's rumors you're really Bill Hicks no proof you son
[3:50:53.360 --> 3:50:57.600]  of a bitch I'm gonna kill you or there's a guy an old OSS guy told me you were
[3:50:57.600 --> 3:51:03.240]  really making the viruses I mean again we now know it's the FBI it's the
[3:51:03.240 --> 3:51:07.800]  governments that are making the viruses to steal data and surveil everybody it's
[3:51:07.800 --> 3:51:12.160]  never come out that virus companies are making viruses why would you ever do
[3:51:12.160 --> 3:51:15.440]  that because you would surely get caught it came out the US government with the
[3:51:15.440 --> 3:51:19.440]  Israelis made Stuxnet you cannot hide this stuff yeah you'd make a lot more
[3:51:19.440 --> 3:51:23.480]  money writing the code to correct the real viruses that are out there and when
[3:51:23.480 --> 3:51:25.760]  it first started it wasn't the government's doing when it first started
[3:51:25.760 --> 3:51:29.840]  it was really just hackers throughout the world that were you know like people
[3:51:29.840 --> 3:51:34.000]  just wanting to disrupt life because they had no life of their own now it's
[3:51:34.000 --> 3:51:37.800]  cybercrime I mean there's a guy named Kaspersky who has his software suite
[3:51:37.800 --> 3:51:43.720]  he's a Russian guy a former KGB dude and this guy he he does a lot of research
[3:51:43.720 --> 3:51:48.200]  into all these viruses and he's been at the forefront of exposing the things
[3:51:48.200 --> 3:51:52.600]  like Stuxnet breaking it down who put it together you know what does this code
[3:51:52.600 --> 3:51:56.000]  look like and and all the follow-ups that came out of that was flame that
[3:51:56.000 --> 3:52:00.400]  there's been a couple other versions out there and you know there's all kinds of
[3:52:00.400 --> 3:52:04.560]  people writing viruses all over the world and now it's all about cybercrime
[3:52:04.560 --> 3:52:08.520]  and surveillance it's government it's government sponsored you know a lot of
[3:52:08.520 --> 3:52:13.400]  these things up it's now the Chinese Russian US government NATO EU it's an
[3:52:13.400 --> 3:52:17.400]  all-out exploitation war Brzezinski's argument is they even want to run the
[3:52:17.400 --> 3:52:21.040]  crime and run the money laundering so quote others don't get that market and
[3:52:21.040 --> 3:52:24.960]  blood supply that's the argument for the system to run crime openly and we are
[3:52:24.960 --> 3:52:31.000]  woefully unprepared for what's happening where's it all going John McAfee well if
[3:52:31.000 --> 3:52:34.640]  we don't do something it's going into absolute devastation for this country
[3:52:34.640 --> 3:52:40.880]  absolute describe why because all you have to do is destabilize the economy
[3:52:40.880 --> 3:52:44.400]  for example if you if you look at what's happened just in the past few months
[3:52:44.400 --> 3:52:50.200]  three or four major retailers large retailers we've got Target we have Neiman
[3:52:50.200 --> 3:52:55.120]  Marcus where it's a whole bunch of them were hundreds of millions of credit cards
[3:52:55.120 --> 3:52:58.480]  were stolen nothing what if they only what if they only managed to get a
[3:52:58.480 --> 3:53:01.520]  hundred or two hundred dollars off of each one think what that's going to do
[3:53:01.520 --> 3:53:05.000]  to this economy think what it has done perhaps this economy and it's getting
[3:53:05.000 --> 3:53:08.720]  worse and worse so is that a state job probably Russians or something with
[3:53:08.720 --> 3:53:12.640]  target you know I don't think so I think it's it depends what we call by the
[3:53:12.640 --> 3:53:16.000]  state and Russia it's difficult to separate this well there's mafia deep
[3:53:16.000 --> 3:53:20.280]  right the mafia deep state I think is what's doing it well you know it when
[3:53:20.280 --> 3:53:22.960]  they take credit information when they take money I mean those things to the
[3:53:22.960 --> 3:53:27.640]  consumer are very recoverable you can clean up your credit and you can you
[3:53:27.640 --> 3:53:30.800]  know you've got certain protections and things like that no doubt there's a big
[3:53:30.800 --> 3:53:34.600]  impact but a lot of people don't realize is that when they when these
[3:53:34.600 --> 3:53:38.240]  breaches happen where they grab your username and your information your
[3:53:38.240 --> 3:53:42.400]  username your password your password it's a well-known fact that's something
[3:53:42.400 --> 3:53:46.320]  like 80 85% of people reuse their passwords everywhere so if I've grabbed
[3:53:46.320 --> 3:53:50.600]  grabbed your password for angry birds or whatever you know there's a good chance
[3:53:50.600 --> 3:53:54.240]  that's part of your password if not your actual past and that's the big issue and
[3:53:54.240 --> 3:53:58.080]  we got guys saying John are you the one making the viruses which I don't think
[3:53:58.080 --> 3:54:01.680]  it's a bad question I'm not attacking the caller is he still there you got any
[3:54:01.680 --> 3:54:05.740]  final comments it's a fair question yeah hi guys yeah so you look at
[3:54:05.740 --> 3:54:10.720]  companies make money they want to maybe go to an RFID and to the to the
[3:54:10.720 --> 3:54:13.920]  credit cards themselves another business opportunity there so these are all
[3:54:13.920 --> 3:54:17.160]  problem reaction solutions too in part so I'm just one of them that's like an
[3:54:17.160 --> 3:54:21.160]  arms race yeah where they keep releasing the new weapons I got to jump
[3:54:21.160 --> 3:54:25.120]  to other people I appreciate your call John McAvie you're the problem you just
[3:54:25.120 --> 3:54:29.200]  heard it let's talk to let's talk to Jonathan in Florida you're on the air
[3:54:29.200 --> 3:54:34.200]  go ahead how are you Alex how are you John we're doing pretty good go ahead
[3:54:34.200 --> 3:54:39.280]  okay well this is my area expertise I just want to say to the previous caller
[3:54:39.280 --> 3:54:44.480]  that has Bola as well as the IRA and the Mexican cartel actually do business
[3:54:44.480 --> 3:54:49.400]  together we try to gain forms of obtaining a weapon of mass destruction so
[3:54:49.400 --> 3:54:54.000]  anything you hear the contrary is quite delight you're absolutely correct that
[3:54:54.000 --> 3:55:00.240]  is absolutely correct sir and I also want to say that as far as people have you
[3:55:00.240 --> 3:55:04.320]  heard about the petition going around where people are being in here in America
[3:55:04.320 --> 3:55:09.360]  or on our land that are being struck it with real pressure frequencies you
[3:55:09.360 --> 3:55:12.720]  should make an application to help people in your own country before you do
[3:55:12.720 --> 3:55:16.120]  anything else in any other country there's all sorts of stuff they had to
[3:55:16.120 --> 3:55:18.720]  detect stuff like that very interesting thank you Jonathan we're gonna move quick
[3:55:18.720 --> 3:55:23.040]  now Rick and Nevada you're on the air with John McAvie yes sir Paul stole my
[3:55:23.040 --> 3:55:28.360]  thunder but I'd like to ask you to consider making the cognizant open
[3:55:28.360 --> 3:55:34.960]  source or free software as free as in free code and free as in the free beer we
[3:55:34.960 --> 3:55:39.160]  will certainly consider that sir thank you thank you Andrew in Illinois go
[3:55:39.160 --> 3:55:47.040]  ahead good luck copy with you John and with you Alex there's a lot of stuff
[3:55:47.040 --> 3:55:54.840]  coming down and in our country and we're gonna get a hopefully we get a pro gun
[3:55:54.840 --> 3:55:58.440]  governor for Illinois that's what we're looking forward to I've already received
[3:55:58.440 --> 3:56:02.040]  a phone call there's a libertarian way of taking the country over we're about to
[3:56:02.040 --> 3:56:04.760]  take up with the Republican Party that's why Obama might start a war with
[3:56:04.760 --> 3:56:09.000]  the Russians to make him the hero to get his whole agenda through that's why I
[3:56:09.000 --> 3:56:12.360]  just realized I got a bad feeling and I've been having that one for six months
[3:56:12.360 --> 3:56:16.440]  John I think they may actually start a big war with Russia I think we're in deep
[3:56:16.440 --> 3:56:19.840]  crap what do you say you know I have no information on that whatsoever I'm saying
[3:56:19.840 --> 3:56:23.720]  I mean it's a believable scenario no question about it I just hope cooler
[3:56:23.720 --> 3:56:27.280]  heads prevail what do you think Andrew they don't want us to take the country
[3:56:27.280 --> 3:56:33.160]  back oh I'm all for what you're doing and I'm a strong supporters like an
[3:56:33.160 --> 3:56:38.080]  amendment speaking of planes real quick on the Kennedy plane downing there was
[3:56:38.080 --> 3:56:44.680]  two 9-1-1 stories in UPI and associated press about mid-air explosion once they
[3:56:44.680 --> 3:56:49.080]  found the debris filled they killed the story oh yeah you're talking about JFK
[3:56:49.080 --> 3:56:52.680]  junior they killed him dead in a hammer because he was gonna probably run for
[3:56:52.680 --> 3:56:55.880]  the Senate and then president there was no way he ended up losing down the road
[3:56:55.880 --> 3:56:59.760]  that is true whether that actually happened I do not know what you are
[3:56:59.760 --> 3:57:02.320]  I remember going over all the evidence man they killed him better than a hammer
[3:57:02.320 --> 3:57:07.920]  thanks Andrew final caller Raymond in California real fast oh hey guys I
[3:57:07.920 --> 3:57:12.640]  remember you guys were talking about the software privacy issue but I also read
[3:57:12.640 --> 3:57:17.800]  an article that there were 3g spy chips inside many yeah what about Intel and
[3:57:17.800 --> 3:57:21.720]  all those guys that have the chips that power up themselves well this is a
[3:57:21.720 --> 3:57:26.560]  serious problem the question is is what motivated them to do this I suspect
[3:57:26.560 --> 3:57:30.720]  that there was serious pressure from one or more agencies within the US
[3:57:30.720 --> 3:57:35.960]  government to do this because this opens up everybody to every kind of spying
[3:57:35.960 --> 3:57:40.000]  and yeah even if your computer's not wired in what do they call that boxed her
[3:57:40.000 --> 3:57:44.240]  yes so even if your computer's not they can just energize it and suck
[3:57:44.240 --> 3:57:48.840]  everything out so again I have no specific information on this and I hate
[3:57:48.840 --> 3:57:52.520]  to comment on things I know nothing about but it certainly it bodes ill for
[3:57:52.520 --> 3:57:56.040]  all of us well it's admitted and it's just it's incredible thank you so much
