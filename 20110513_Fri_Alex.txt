[00:00.000 --> 00:11.760]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well
[00:11.760 --> 00:19.300]  so does he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin
[00:19.300 --> 00:29.800]  Texas Alex Jones welcome my friends welcome and thank you for joining us
[00:29.800 --> 00:37.360]  it is Friday the 13th day of May 2011 we're gonna be live here or at least the
[00:37.360 --> 00:41.480]  next three hours coming up at the bottom of the next hour a state
[00:41.480 --> 00:46.880]  representative here in Texas who authored the bill that has now passed the
[00:46.880 --> 00:55.540]  House to basically enforce the felony laws against the out-of-control out of
[00:55.540 --> 01:00.820]  their jurisdiction federal toilet attendant workers known as the TSA
[01:00.820 --> 01:06.300]  it's about the level of training swarm peace officer can't stick their hands
[01:06.300 --> 01:10.700]  down your pants to grow up your wife's breast but these guys do and now they're
[01:10.700 --> 01:16.060]  moving on to taking babies diapers off so Texas is moving along with more than
[01:16.060 --> 01:22.620]  20 other states to enforce the law I've asked lawyers on air why and district
[01:22.620 --> 01:26.380]  attorneys why do we need a law if it's already illegal and I've had district
[01:26.380 --> 01:32.060]  attorneys on record say that's right prosecute now but we're gonna be going
[01:32.060 --> 01:38.020]  over that big strike for Liberty moving forward also a House GOP moves to
[01:38.020 --> 01:43.180]  defund naked body scanners that will anger their Republican colleague who's
[01:43.180 --> 01:49.420]  making a lot of the money off of it mr. Cherdoff who mandated all of this see
[01:49.420 --> 01:52.700]  that's a big part of the police state not just that the globalist want to
[01:52.700 --> 01:57.740]  control us and track us and violate all our rights so they can carry out their
[01:57.740 --> 02:04.820]  other looting and criminal activities but also we're talking about trillions
[02:04.820 --> 02:09.940]  and trillions and trillions well it's over three trillion spent the last nine
[02:09.940 --> 02:16.560]  years post 9-11 domestically in some cases per city I saw an eight billion
[02:16.560 --> 02:21.700]  dollar contract over five years in New York for the AI smart cameras tracking
[02:21.700 --> 02:28.060]  everybody saw two billion federal grant for Boston I mean those are just the
[02:28.060 --> 02:32.380]  smart camera spy camera systems two million San Antonio one elementary
[02:32.380 --> 02:37.180]  school for the spy cams in the cafeteria AI tracking the behavior of the
[02:37.180 --> 02:41.420]  children in their eating habits that was in AP two days ago I mean you start
[02:41.420 --> 02:45.380]  adding this up it's it's over three trillion that's what they admit in
[02:45.380 --> 02:51.580]  domestic cost internationally the cost of the bin Laden attack is another three
[02:51.580 --> 02:58.100]  trillion so six trillion dollars and I remember it came out with four or five
[02:58.100 --> 03:04.860]  years ago one Halliburton tarp that would cost they estimated $500 to put
[03:04.860 --> 03:13.940]  up a multi-person tarp tent was 15 million dollars that makes $800 toilet
[03:13.940 --> 03:20.700]  seats at the Pentagon and $700 hammers look like good deals doesn't so that's
[03:20.700 --> 03:25.180]  why this isn't going away and it's the new economy and the majority of the
[03:25.180 --> 03:30.020]  new scholarships in the last nine years the biggest growth area is homeland
[03:30.020 --> 03:36.900]  security data mining spying domestic spy degrees I mean that's that's the
[03:36.900 --> 03:42.540]  future of America not television sets and computers or even farming for that
[03:42.540 --> 03:48.820]  matter the family farm is under assault the federal government openly tells
[03:48.820 --> 03:54.900]  small farms and ranches and the IRS does as well get big or get out and no you
[03:54.900 --> 03:58.460]  can't work at the gas station or work at the prison or work at the power plant or
[03:58.460 --> 04:01.740]  work at the school but then have 30 cows and your own farm and work on the
[04:01.740 --> 04:06.380]  weekend and then just use that to pay the local state property taxes that's a
[04:06.380 --> 04:10.740]  hobby farm now you can't write that off it's got to make a profit you're like
[04:10.740 --> 04:16.420]  but it does make some money and then allows us to pay the taxes my family's
[04:16.420 --> 04:23.060]  in this that position and they just say doesn't matter tax exemption gone you
[04:23.060 --> 04:28.940]  will pay income tax on the tractor on the fence post you will lose your property
[04:28.940 --> 04:32.540]  and we're gonna raise your property taxes as well at the state level that's
[04:32.540 --> 04:37.100]  the way it is the way America works and if you try to sell milk to your
[04:37.100 --> 04:42.420]  neighbor SWAT teams year-long investigation spying on the Amish to
[04:42.420 --> 04:47.820]  arrest some old Amish guy doing something legal oh and I've got their new
[04:47.820 --> 04:52.180]  copyright act the Senate's trying to pass no judge no jury no nothing they

[04:56.940 --> 05:04.540]  it haha it's all coming up hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you
[05:04.540 --> 05:08.820]  about the silver lungs generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal
[05:08.820 --> 05:13.180]  silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing
[05:13.180 --> 05:17.060]  the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the first line of
[05:17.060 --> 05:21.020]  defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator
[05:21.020 --> 05:25.780]  infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano silver solutions
[05:25.780 --> 05:30.660]  and also delivers the silver nano particles instantly into the bloodstream
[05:30.660 --> 05:35.460]  with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products you
[05:35.460 --> 05:39.740]  can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs
[05:39.740 --> 05:43.620]  generator very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided
[05:43.620 --> 05:50.540]  making production fast and simple go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn
[05:50.540 --> 05:53.860]  more about the breakthrough technology of the silver lungs generator that's
[05:53.860 --> 05:58.420]  www.silverlungs.com
[06:00.940 --> 06:05.780]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[06:05.780 --> 06:11.260]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[06:11.260 --> 06:15.540]  we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home tremendous influence
[06:15.540 --> 06:20.380]  on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots I think
[06:20.380 --> 06:25.780]  it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention for the
[06:25.780 --> 06:30.380]  republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal off-short cartel
[06:30.380 --> 06:34.780]  hell bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world
[06:34.780 --> 06:38.500]  government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists they're asking for more
[06:38.500 --> 06:42.420]  matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to today seems
[06:42.420 --> 06:47.980]  like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of
[06:47.980 --> 06:54.140]  the republic get your copy of fall of the republic on DVD at info wars.com we're
[06:54.140 --> 07:00.420]  watching online right now in super high quality at prison planet TV this is
[07:00.420 --> 07:03.820]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[07:03.820 --> 07:07.740]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[07:07.740 --> 07:12.020]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[07:12.020 --> 07:16.300]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[07:16.300 --> 07:20.620]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[07:20.620 --> 07:24.700]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[07:24.700 --> 07:29.260]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[07:29.260 --> 07:33.420]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[07:33.420 --> 07:37.380]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[07:37.380 --> 07:41.180]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[07:41.180 --> 07:43.900]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[07:43.900 --> 07:49.900]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[07:49.900 --> 07:54.580]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to
[07:54.580 --> 08:00.380]  my solar backup.com or call 1-877-327-0365
[08:00.380 --> 08:09.140]  he's the T-rex of political talk Alex Jones on the GCN radio network
[08:09.140 --> 08:16.900]  all right we got Bob Chapman joining us to break down all the big developments in
[08:16.900 --> 08:21.340]  the economy gold and silver as the establishment of the big central banks
[08:21.340 --> 08:26.060]  openly dump billions and billions of paper onto the market in an attempt to
[08:26.060 --> 08:30.580]  hold down gold and silver he'll be joining us the first 30 minutes of the
[08:30.580 --> 08:36.060]  third hour Jim Mars called me a few days ago after he heard Lugliosi live the
[08:36.060 --> 08:46.300]  famous prosecutor with his JFK Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone tome and his
[08:46.300 --> 08:49.740]  statements that no one saw people shooting from the grassy knoll no one
[08:49.740 --> 08:53.500]  saw people there and it was just all over the news at the time that police
[08:53.500 --> 08:59.100]  witnessed it the guy at the railway yard who later mysteriously died saw it so I
[08:59.100 --> 09:04.180]  thought we'd get Jim Mars who taught the first university level course decades
[09:04.180 --> 09:11.180]  ago on the JFK assassination and we have the Congress in their committee in the
[09:11.180 --> 09:16.100]  late 70s found a 95% chance that there were other people shooting due to
[09:16.100 --> 09:20.020]  acoustic recording so that were analyzed from the grassy knoll so that's
[09:20.020 --> 09:24.300]  coming up with Jim Mars last 30 minutes state rep David Simpson who authored the
[09:24.300 --> 09:32.860]  bill to ban offensive grope downs in Texas will be joining us as well coming
[09:32.860 --> 09:38.860]  up in an hour and 22 minutes from now I do want to open the phones up for first
[09:38.860 --> 09:42.500]  time callers and I noticed yesterday when I started going to some calls I
[09:42.500 --> 09:47.060]  recognize some of the voices we have millions of listeners I love hearing
[09:47.060 --> 09:50.940]  from our regular callers but people wait by the phone and speed dial when the
[09:50.940 --> 09:58.220]  phone system opens up and we don't screen calls and so I've always just done it
[09:58.220 --> 10:02.460]  that way where you're not interrogated to get on but then because we don't screen
[10:02.460 --> 10:05.700]  calls that allows people that are waiting by their phones to tend to get in
[10:05.700 --> 10:11.660]  more than others that are trying so if I talk to you and I recognize your voice
[10:11.660 --> 10:15.260]  I'm gonna have to hang up on you because I want to give people who've never been
[10:15.260 --> 10:18.940]  able to have a chance to get on air a chance to get in and I'll be taking your
[10:18.940 --> 10:21.900]  phone call starting at the bottom of this hour right through to the bottom of
[10:21.900 --> 10:28.220]  the next hour on this open line Friday I guess we could use that ubiquitous talk
[10:28.220 --> 10:33.180]  radio term the toll-free number to join us well let me just read through some of
[10:33.180 --> 10:37.060]  the news headlines and then I'm gonna go back into more detail and then I'll
[10:37.060 --> 10:40.780]  give the number up because I want you to hear the issues and points that I think
[10:40.780 --> 10:43.500]  are important then we'll have open phones you can bring up whatever issue you
[10:43.500 --> 10:46.820]  want now but it might be interesting if you a comment on some of the news that
[10:46.820 --> 10:52.580]  I raise obviously they've been trying to assassinate Muammar Gaddafi and bombing
[10:52.580 --> 10:55.900]  his different homes and government buildings and killing members of his
[10:55.900 --> 11:01.180]  family and then telling us at the same time that they're not trying to kill
[11:01.180 --> 11:06.300]  him because that violates international law this is just the standard
[11:06.300 --> 11:10.620]  government lies I mean even if you agree with trying to murder Gaddafi it sets a
[11:10.620 --> 11:16.740]  very dangerous precedent to just have Skynet and the Imperial drone aircraft
[11:16.740 --> 11:21.280]  circling the globe killing whoever they want whenever they want and then when
[11:21.280 --> 11:27.060]  they rain down the two thousand pound bombs the hellfire missiles and when the
[11:27.060 --> 11:33.220]  reapers and the other aircraft drop their weapons the predators drop their
[11:33.220 --> 11:38.060]  weapons saying this is not a military action this is not a war and this is not
[11:38.060 --> 11:46.420]  an assassination attempt we are entering a very Orwellian zone right now where
[11:46.420 --> 11:51.660]  the system knows they're being caught in total lies and deception and they want
[11:51.660 --> 11:57.580]  to be caught they want to just set the precedent that they lie in finitum as a
[11:57.580 --> 12:02.140]  kleptocratic state owned by foreign corporations they're gonna do whatever
[12:02.140 --> 12:08.380]  they want so we've got that Russia warns West against Libyan scenario in Syria as
[12:08.380 --> 12:12.580]  the West and the US Senate now begins to beat the drums to start bombardments of
[12:12.580 --> 12:18.020]  Syria to back the admittedly Western funded Al Qaeda Muslim Brotherhood
[12:18.020 --> 12:22.660]  groups in the South and there's also reports Libyan group associated with
[12:22.660 --> 12:27.460]  Al Qaeda meets with Obama officials and are given the official government
[12:27.460 --> 12:33.100]  endorsement to take over the new puppet dictatorship Reuters reports and Kurt
[12:33.100 --> 12:36.540]  Demos got a big boil down article dealing with that headline Libyan group
[12:36.540 --> 12:42.660]  associated with Al Qaeda meets Obama officials up on info wars.com also
[12:42.660 --> 12:48.420]  protest for Palestinian right of return that is just some of the news on that
[12:48.420 --> 12:54.620]  front that we're going to be going over more today we've got the regularly
[12:54.620 --> 13:00.780]  scheduled I see these every few weeks articles from California Massachusetts
[13:00.780 --> 13:07.020]  Texas you name it a student has a Bible in their bag it's confiscated but any
[13:07.020 --> 13:10.540]  other book is fine it's all part of the political correctness that is really
[13:10.540 --> 13:17.460]  a Soviet style brainwashing but here's one at a WWLP TV controversy over
[13:17.460 --> 13:23.700]  child's flag drawing and this is out of orange Massachusetts and they were I
[13:23.700 --> 13:29.020]  guess having the kids draw pictures then hang them on the wall and he drew an
[13:29.020 --> 13:32.900]  American flag and they said that could offend the illegal aliens show it had to
[13:32.900 --> 13:39.020]  be taken down reportedly we also again have the good news with the state rep
[13:39.020 --> 13:44.580]  joining us on this front Texas House bans offensive security pat downs but
[13:44.580 --> 13:49.020]  it's got to make its way now through the Senate and the bills chief sponsor
[13:49.020 --> 13:53.540]  Republican representative David Simpson said this has to do with dignity and
[13:53.540 --> 13:58.900]  travel and prohibiting indecent groping searches and it's all about a power grab
[13:58.900 --> 14:02.540]  I mean just six months ago was grabbed it was patting on the outside then a
[14:02.540 --> 14:05.980]  month later it was squeezing I mean almost lifting men and women off the
[14:05.980 --> 14:10.540]  ground let me see if those are genitals squeezing them I mean this is
[14:10.540 --> 14:15.820]  incredible then it was in the pants then it was in the underwear then it was
[14:15.820 --> 14:21.460]  grabbing not changing the gloves I mean this is amazing a doctor did this they
[14:21.460 --> 14:27.140]  would lose their license I mean even if you went to a doctor agreed for them to
[14:27.140 --> 14:32.500]  check for a hernia or whatever and then grab the male genitalia and have you
[14:32.500 --> 14:36.540]  cough if the doctor didn't change gloves and that could be documented medical
[14:36.540 --> 14:41.820]  license gone boom but power tripping you know yeah I've been seeing the
[14:41.820 --> 14:46.380]  different photos and videos of TSA bugging their eyes out the photo out of
[14:46.380 --> 14:52.740]  CBS News of DFW you know has this image of the TSA guy with his gloves we'll
[14:52.740 --> 14:57.260]  put it up on screen there it is and he just has this arrogant look and then I
[14:57.260 --> 15:02.340]  saw these photos of police in New York on alert with big dark circles around
[15:02.340 --> 15:08.420]  their eyes devil tats on their forearms just bugging their eyes out sticking
[15:08.420 --> 15:12.860]  their lower lip out just just looking at people and I've been in New York and
[15:12.860 --> 15:17.500]  and years ago this was going on but it gets crazier and crazier any type of
[15:17.500 --> 15:21.060]  media event they're there with German shepherds just posing and strutting
[15:21.060 --> 15:24.740]  around and bugging their eyes out at you and I've even tried to say hey how you
[15:24.740 --> 15:29.420]  doing there's like hey I mean they just find people that love the power trip of
[15:29.420 --> 15:34.500]  strutting around with their with their m16 acting like terrorist or everywhere
[15:34.500 --> 15:39.340]  as if a real terrorist pulled up with a truck bomber with a gun as if that guy
[15:39.340 --> 15:44.540]  is gonna stop anything I mean it's just insane but the same government then
[15:44.540 --> 15:47.940]  doesn't want people armed on college campuses so they can actually deal with
[15:47.940 --> 15:55.460]  the gunman it's just just incredible continuing along this line big report
[15:55.460 --> 15:59.820]  out at prisonplanet.com control freak society government to monitor school
[15:59.820 --> 16:07.380]  lunches with AI smart cameras and we're gonna go over some more of that report
[16:07.380 --> 16:14.140]  a little bit later because here's the deal here's why I get so frustrated and
[16:14.140 --> 16:19.300]  start yelling and screaming on air in the past four or five days it's because I
[16:19.300 --> 16:24.380]  see the prison being built I see it being expanded I witnessed the constant
[16:24.380 --> 16:30.940]  deception and corruption of governments worldwide run by the very same group of
[16:30.940 --> 16:35.700]  international corporations I see the final countries that the globalists
[16:35.700 --> 16:39.700]  didn't control being overthrown and mopped up and it doesn't mean those are
[16:39.700 --> 16:44.660]  even good countries or good leaders you know the Serbs sure corrupt that's
[16:44.660 --> 16:49.060]  government somehow they taught Americans since the 50s that government isn't
[16:49.060 --> 16:52.900]  corrupt and is good and you should trust and give all your rights up that's not
[16:52.900 --> 16:57.260]  that I think Iran's great or even Libya the point is they weren't controlled by
[16:57.260 --> 17:03.540]  the globalist and so they're being overthrown and I remember seeing the
[17:03.540 --> 17:09.020]  federal grants to the states in the mid 90s for face scanning cameras lysis
[17:09.020 --> 17:13.300]  late reading cameras the first states that had them put in in the mid 90s
[17:13.300 --> 17:18.380]  were Texas and Indiana where they were beta testing it then California in New
[17:18.380 --> 17:22.340]  York you would expect California in New York to be first but it was Texas in
[17:22.340 --> 17:30.140]  Indiana and I witnessed that and I and I had the federal grants for hundreds of
[17:30.140 --> 17:34.340]  millions of dollars just in the initial funding I had the federal grants and
[17:34.340 --> 17:41.940]  showed images of the federal grants and in my film police day 2000 for
[17:41.940 --> 17:46.740]  microphones going in shotgun mics that can listen to you at hundreds of feet
[17:46.740 --> 17:53.900]  away with AI NSA software recording all the keywords and shifting through it and
[17:53.900 --> 17:59.420]  and then I would be interviewed by local TV or radio or national TV or radio
[17:59.420 --> 18:03.260]  what happened across the board and and callers would laugh at me and hosts would
[18:03.260 --> 18:10.180]  laugh at me and I would go down and protest text dot I remember a 97 for
[18:10.180 --> 18:15.300]  putting in the spy cameras and the spokesman for text dot came out and
[18:15.300 --> 18:19.020]  interviewed me and he laughed at me and he said no Alex we're not surveilling you
[18:19.020 --> 18:26.580]  with the cameras we're not watching you and I said wait a minute let's be clear
[18:26.580 --> 18:31.580]  you as the Texas Department of Transportation aren't surveilling but in
[18:31.580 --> 18:35.660]  the dual use the Texas Department of Public Safety is under the federal
[18:35.660 --> 18:39.580]  grants and the guy laughed and said you ought to be a lawyer and it doesn't take
[18:39.580 --> 18:46.900]  a lawyer to see the games they play they always semantically deceive it's like
[18:46.900 --> 18:51.740]  two days ago they announced yeah Pentagon funded well the article said
[18:51.740 --> 18:55.300]  federally funded grant two million dollars in a lunchroom to figure out
[18:55.300 --> 18:58.700]  what kids eat and what they don't eat as if they couldn't have them fill out a
[18:58.700 --> 19:02.900]  survey or have somebody do a one-day survey and just just observe what they
[19:02.900 --> 19:07.300]  were eating no no it's a two million dollar system to decide what kids will
[19:07.300 --> 19:11.340]  eat to quote save money and then I went look the system up and and that's part
[19:11.340 --> 19:18.220]  of the use but it's also behavioral analysis of the kids and to condition the
[19:18.220 --> 19:21.500]  kids to live under surveillance but I already knew that when I saw it that it
[19:21.500 --> 19:24.700]  was a DARPA test but I went and looked it up and sure enough it was DARPA because
[19:24.700 --> 19:29.500]  DARPA heads all this up DARPA heads up globally for the entire planet except for
[19:29.500 --> 19:35.340]  the few countries they haven't taken over yet handful the takeover chips and all
[19:35.340 --> 19:38.380]  the phones which they now are telling you were in there and the president will
[19:38.380 --> 19:41.340]  break in and the government will break in and take over whenever they want and
[19:41.340 --> 19:45.180]  the new takeover chips and all the major appliances coming out that's all
[19:45.180 --> 19:51.060]  announced and CNN is telling you that this is happening but I still get
[19:51.060 --> 19:54.420]  emails saying Alex this is too much I don't believe it well here's another
[19:54.420 --> 19:59.900]  report today DARPA's automated video surveillance will end public anonymity

[22:03.380 --> 22:07.300]  nuclear disaster that killed thousands of Japanese citizens is nothing
[22:07.300 --> 22:11.060]  compared to the devastation that could be caused by hyperinflation that will
[22:11.060 --> 22:15.060]  soon hit the United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming
[22:15.060 --> 22:18.980]  homeless all caused by the devalued US dollar while the mainstream media
[22:18.980 --> 22:22.980]  continues to ignore inflation our friends the National Inflation Association

[24:07.860 --> 24:18.140]  the point I'm getting at here is that there is a infrastructure that is being
[24:18.140 --> 24:25.140]  standardized globally and all the big mega corporations go along with it and
[24:25.140 --> 24:29.780]  actually lobby for it because then they get the government contracts and your
[24:29.780 --> 24:38.460]  tax money to put these control systems in so they're using our money to
[24:38.460 --> 24:46.620]  enslave us and control us and they add all of this surveillance tech into the
[24:46.620 --> 24:54.660]  telecommunications infrastructure the devices the highway control systems the
[24:54.660 --> 25:03.500]  banking system they do all of this and then we have to pay for it and they pass
[25:03.500 --> 25:08.620]  the expenses on to us but you remember the newscast going the highway cameras
[25:08.620 --> 25:18.100]  they're not to watch you they're only to control traffic remember the media
[25:18.100 --> 25:22.140]  denying years ago the cell phones do not track where you are the government
[25:22.140 --> 25:26.780]  cannot dial in and listen to you that's conspiracy theorist now they just come
[25:26.780 --> 25:32.540]  out and admit it because they're secure in their control grid they believe that
[25:32.540 --> 25:36.060]  they've incrementally gotten us to accept anything because they've got us way
[25:36.060 --> 25:39.620]  down the road debating torture and government groping our women and
[25:39.620 --> 25:48.500]  children they've got us debating whether we should have any basic liberties so
[25:48.500 --> 25:54.580]  now that's old hat yeah they're watching us but but here's extreme tech why
[25:54.580 --> 26:00.020]  they're giving you the news and linking to the government announcements that this
[26:00.020 --> 26:06.260]  is just now happening I've read MIT reports out of MIT magazine where they
[26:06.260 --> 26:13.740]  were developing this stuff 40 years ago the stuff has been rolled out for
[26:13.740 --> 26:19.980]  decades now it's being put in everywhere DARPA's automated video
[26:19.980 --> 26:27.700]  surveillance will end public anonymity well ten years ago Tampa Florida had
[26:27.700 --> 26:34.180]  face scanning identity cameras up off of your driver's license photo with
[26:34.180 --> 26:38.260]  face prints I mean remember that I remember it more than a decade ago
[26:38.260 --> 26:44.140]  headlines Florida town runs license plate of everyone that drives through it
[26:44.140 --> 26:48.860]  Texas town runs license plate of everyone that drives through it California
[26:48.860 --> 26:59.140]  town it's all wide open to be in public is to be on camera but most video
[26:59.140 --> 27:04.820]  footage is discarded as only so much can be sorted and analyzed until now
[27:04.820 --> 27:09.260]  DARPA has created a technology that can index and analyze video in real time
[27:09.260 --> 27:13.980]  marking the end of anonymity in public places and then this article says they're
[27:13.980 --> 27:18.820]  getting ready to roll it out oh really like AP two days ago with the two million
[27:18.820 --> 27:24.060]  dollar software system and by the way you don't think you're getting overcharged
[27:24.060 --> 27:27.660]  for that little big brother thing I mean even even if you wanted the system
[27:27.660 --> 27:32.340]  which I'll guarantee you that school board you know it is getting lobbied to
[27:32.340 --> 27:37.980]  take the federal grant do you really think the software that analyzes what
[27:37.980 --> 27:42.060]  the kids are eating and doing really cost two million dollars for some cameras
[27:42.060 --> 27:47.860]  over all of the lunch tables and again it they make millions of dollars per
[27:47.860 --> 27:56.100]  lunchroom two million in this case the kids grow up being watched children are
[27:56.100 --> 27:59.820]  our future and what are they doing learning to be frisk learning to be
[27:59.820 --> 28:06.000]  interrogated learning to have cameras in the bathrooms total control in 2008
[28:06.000 --> 28:10.820]  DARPA in the US military's elite group of pocket protector warriors began
[28:10.820 --> 28:14.660]  soliciting the tech industry to develop technologies that would allow computers
[28:14.660 --> 28:19.660]  to sort through the index surveillance footage from military fleet of drones
[28:19.660 --> 28:24.460]  satellites I just like to announce what six years ago that military satellites
[28:24.460 --> 28:29.900]  were from the Cold War being used to spy on ranchers oh feeding an end to
[28:29.900 --> 28:34.940]  Denver, Colorado and the surrounding area in one case are you building a new
[28:34.940 --> 28:40.100]  barn that you weren't authorized under zoning to do ah the local zoning board
[28:40.100 --> 28:45.620]  now has the taxpayer paid for Department of Defense
[28:46.460 --> 28:51.220]  satellites and you see the same thing in England and in Europe and Australia just
[28:51.220 --> 28:56.180]  type in Australian government using satellites to enforce zoning laws to
[28:56.180 --> 29:01.100]  enforce environmental laws see this is the control you pay for this to fight
[29:01.100 --> 29:10.980]  al-Qaeda to fight the Russians it's for you so the control freaks and
[29:10.980 --> 29:14.460]  government can set up there on Mount Olympus like God or Odin up on his
[29:14.460 --> 29:20.660]  mountain dispatching the SWAT teams go forward forward beat them into submission
[29:20.660 --> 29:27.940]  go forward TSA stick your hand down their pants hammer them into submission and
[29:27.940 --> 29:33.860]  it goes on to talk about how these systems are going in and how it can run
[29:33.860 --> 29:36.380]  through millions of different camera feeds basically feed them into
[29:36.380 --> 29:40.900]  computers and track everywhere you go off of your face this is old news but new
[29:40.900 --> 29:45.620]  news to the slaves now I want to get in to the latest at Fukushima and this

[34:55.700 --> 35:01.180]  security administration purse crings are moving to cut off new funding for those
[35:01.180 --> 35:05.620]  advanced airport scanners that have sparked outrage over the revealing
[35:05.620 --> 35:10.700]  images of travelers bodies now see it's a power grab and it's a bridge too far
[35:10.700 --> 35:15.300]  but why shouldn't they try it by being so bold other things that are out of
[35:15.300 --> 35:20.220]  control don't seem as bad and they can continue to find cities and counties that
[35:20.220 --> 35:24.420]  will accept the body scanners and they've got cops at the courthouses and
[35:24.420 --> 35:27.860]  and sheriff's deputies that will follow orders and put you and your family
[35:27.860 --> 35:32.180]  through them until you sue them like what happened again in Colorado and then
[35:32.180 --> 35:36.580]  they said okay under 18 you don't have to because it violates child porn loss
[35:36.580 --> 35:41.700]  we have to enforce the law against the government the law is there for the
[35:41.700 --> 35:45.780]  government more than anybody else study history study the founding fathers
[35:45.780 --> 35:49.860]  study what they went through the same stuff we're starting to go through but
[35:49.860 --> 35:55.620]  in a low-tech version of it so very good news there draft legislation released
[35:55.620 --> 36:00.260]  yesterday by the appropriations homeland security subcommittee denies the
[36:00.260 --> 36:05.180]  Obama administration 76 million request for an additional 275 of the scanners
[36:05.180 --> 36:08.660]  they need to cut the funding for the upkeep up they need to Congress to
[36:08.660 --> 36:11.860]  just stand up and remove the stinking things stop letting the presidency be a
[36:11.860 --> 36:16.780]  dictatorship which many travelers dislike because TSA employees can view
[36:16.780 --> 36:20.180]  full-body images of travelers and people say well then just opt out when
[36:20.180 --> 36:23.740]  they grope you and then now they grope you on top of it in many cases and it
[36:23.740 --> 36:27.620]  goes on so you got to support the Republicans on that you got to call
[36:27.620 --> 36:33.940]  the Republican chairman Robert Adderholt of Alaska and I want to try to get him
[36:33.940 --> 36:38.900]  on and say good job that's the right direction and you got to support the
[36:38.900 --> 36:44.100]  Texas legislature good job on the producers getting the main sponsor of
[36:44.100 --> 36:48.100]  it the head honcho of the legislation that's out past the state house
[36:48.100 --> 36:52.340]  representative for District 7 David Simpson is scheduled to be on with us
[36:52.340 --> 36:57.860]  in about an hour and Texas House bans offensive security patdown so so there's
[36:57.860 --> 37:03.020]  the good news now see see we've got to learn that when we fight back we win all
[37:03.020 --> 37:07.860]  over the country just out in the city a log of this outside Austin big bedroom
[37:07.860 --> 37:13.820]  community of Austin they've now removed fluoride from their water why why should
[37:13.820 --> 37:18.420]  the city of Lago Vista was paying something like $50,000 a year Austin
[37:18.420 --> 37:23.340]  pays over a million a year for the fluoride that's a toxic waste derivative
[37:23.340 --> 37:32.620]  and it's just it's just mind-blowing that that we would pay for this and they
[37:32.620 --> 37:37.980]  just removed it in Lago Vista and I see reports every few days of big cities
[37:37.980 --> 37:42.860]  small towns San Diego's on the verge of not fluoridating they've had a big fight
[37:42.860 --> 37:47.420]  over that we can win when we get involved and keep pushing and pushing and
[37:47.420 --> 37:50.500]  pushing you notice the globalists are like a dog you're playing tug-of-war with
[37:50.500 --> 37:54.660]  they never want to give up because they realize once you learn that you can win
[37:54.660 --> 38:01.060]  once we learn that we can win once we realize what degenerate openly criminal
[38:01.060 --> 38:04.980]  openly arrogant there's a reason if you go to the Austin City Council even with
[38:04.980 --> 38:09.700]  top scientists and medical doctors and head toxicologist and read to them even
[38:09.700 --> 38:14.980]  the this happened a few months ago the big AP headlines of the federal
[38:14.980 --> 38:18.020]  government saying cut the amount of fluoride in the water and it does cause
[38:18.020 --> 38:24.180]  cancer the mayor laughs the laughing is a psychological warfare operation of
[38:24.180 --> 38:29.460]  degenerate scum to make you feel pathetic and to act like you don't have
[38:29.460 --> 38:33.540]  power when they're outrageously up there making you pay a million bucks a
[38:33.540 --> 38:37.180]  year plus I think there's something like a million one hundred thousand we've
[38:37.180 --> 38:42.460]  we've had fluoride action here in Austin in with the city documents they did
[38:42.460 --> 38:46.620]  four years to get and they just laughing you oh you're here with top
[38:46.620 --> 38:53.340]  scientists that flew here to to to tell me how deadly it is I'm gonna laugh no
[38:53.340 --> 38:56.740]  intellectual debate no scientific research says you're a conspiracy theorist
[38:56.740 --> 39:04.460]  ah ha ha ha but see that doesn't work anymore call the scums bluff call the
[39:04.460 --> 39:08.500]  scums bluff you know good criminals when they're robbing your house with a van
[39:08.500 --> 39:11.140]  when they know you're out of town they'll pull up like they're moving
[39:11.140 --> 39:15.300]  company they'll walk in in a uniform if you even they trip the alarm and the
[39:15.300 --> 39:18.180]  neighbor comes over they say oh I'm trying to call them they gave me the
[39:18.180 --> 39:22.820]  code but it didn't work in the neighbors like okay thanks thanks ace moving or
[39:22.820 --> 39:26.060]  whatever the fake sticker is that's what government does and the big
[39:26.060 --> 39:29.660]  corporations they're just robinous and hey we're wearing the moving company
[39:29.660 --> 39:35.780]  uniforms they're hijackers of the society so I gave you some of the good
[39:35.780 --> 39:39.620]  news and I've got some other good news as well here's the bad news and there's
[39:39.620 --> 39:47.100]  quite a bit of it court no right to resist illegal cop entry into home no
[39:47.100 --> 39:54.300]  right to resist illegal cop entry into the home and it continues here this is
[39:54.300 --> 39:59.060]  out of the Northwest Indiana Times a big publication up there and they have
[39:59.060 --> 40:04.940]  the excerpts of the court ruling and it says overturning a common law dating
[40:04.940 --> 40:10.060]  back to English Magna Carta 1215 England's already done this as well the
[40:10.060 --> 40:14.860]  Indiana Supreme Court ruled Thursday that Hoosiers have no right to resist
[40:14.860 --> 40:19.540]  unlawful police entry into their homes so that means if somebody's dressed up
[40:19.540 --> 40:24.020]  like a fake cop I can't stop them or I see this every few months at Austin
[40:24.020 --> 40:28.140]  fake cops pulling over mainly good-looking women and trying to shake
[40:28.140 --> 40:31.860]  them down I mean you know pervs like to dress up in uniforms and actually
[40:31.860 --> 40:38.020]  become cops criminology shows but also they like to say their cops if they
[40:38.020 --> 40:41.660]  can't jump through the hoops to become one not saying all cops are pervs but
[40:41.660 --> 40:46.460]  you know that's where the criminals go I mean it's admitted in criminology most
[40:46.460 --> 40:50.620]  people that are working at YMCA with kids are not pervs but the statistically
[40:50.620 --> 40:54.500]  there's a higher number because that's where the kids are at school teachers on
[40:54.500 --> 40:57.700]  average aren't pervs much higher level of them are pervs than the general
[40:57.700 --> 41:01.220]  population because they want to be around children same thing with truancy
[41:01.220 --> 41:05.980]  officers it's just off the chart CPS workers you're talking from numbers I've
[41:05.980 --> 41:10.700]  seen I mean it's close to half or some as they're the ones that can get away
[41:10.700 --> 41:15.660]  with it they like to take the kids behind closed doors overturning a common law
[41:15.660 --> 41:20.420]  dating back to English Magna Carta of 1215 the Indiana Supreme Court ruled
[41:20.420 --> 41:25.140]  Thursday that Hoosiers have no right to resist unlawful police entry into their
[41:25.140 --> 41:31.100]  homes in the decision three to two Justice Stephen David writing for the
[41:31.100 --> 41:34.820]  courts that the police officer wants to enter a home for any reason or no reason
[41:34.820 --> 41:39.120]  at all a homeowner cannot do anything to block the officer's entry now ladies and
[41:39.120 --> 41:44.500]  gentlemen that is the complete end of the Fourth Amendment that is the complete
[41:44.500 --> 41:50.420]  end just the court ruled for any reason they don't have to give a reason you are
[41:50.420 --> 41:54.540]  going to let them in without warrants there is no more probable cause the
[41:54.540 --> 42:01.580]  probable cause is if you saw somebody with a knife to someone's throat dragging
[42:01.580 --> 42:07.380]  them into a doorway probable cause kicked the door in or the cop is walking
[42:07.380 --> 42:12.020]  by and he sees someone smoking a bong and exhaling the marijuana he still
[42:12.020 --> 42:15.740]  wants to go ahead and you know call backup or whatever but he can pretty
[42:15.740 --> 42:20.220]  much force his way in that's not what they've ruled that I have the ruling I
[42:20.220 --> 42:25.220]  just read you the quote in the decision any reason or no reason and this is same
[42:25.220 --> 42:29.180]  things happening in Europe this is this is incredible Justice Robert Rucker a
[42:29.180 --> 42:34.820]  Gary native and Justice Brent Dickerson a Hobart native in a dissented on the
[42:34.820 --> 42:38.420]  ruling saying the court's decision runs afoul of the Fourth Amendment of the US
[42:38.420 --> 42:45.900]  Constitution gee you think so it goes on in my view the majority sweeps with far
[42:45.900 --> 42:49.580]  too broad a brush by essentially telling Indiana citizens that government
[42:49.580 --> 42:53.180]  agents may now enter their homes illegally this is without the necessary
[42:53.180 --> 42:58.300]  and the necessity of a warrant consistent or extended circumstances Rucker said I
[42:58.300 --> 43:03.980]  disagree and it goes on and look all over the country they have federal grants
[43:03.980 --> 43:10.180]  to have warrantless blood taking checkpoints all over the country they
[43:10.180 --> 43:13.820]  got federal grants and Pentagon grants to put cameras in schools all over the
[43:13.820 --> 43:18.500]  country they got federal grants to do all of this it's federal grants to have
[43:18.500 --> 43:21.540]  anti-terror training for your local police and then they go to the anti-terror
[43:21.540 --> 43:25.060]  training they're given manuals that Ron Paul's evil gun owners are evil
[43:25.060 --> 43:28.860]  veterans are evil that sounds crazier if you're a new listener just search
[43:28.860 --> 43:33.020]  homeland security says veterans number one threat you'll get Fox News a week
[43:33.020 --> 43:40.460]  after we broke it now there's that information they're available for
[43:40.460 --> 43:43.540]  anybody who wants to look at it to understand it and to know what's
[43:43.540 --> 43:54.060]  happening now why is this so bold because why shouldn't they try why shouldn't
[43:54.060 --> 43:57.420]  they try if they never get punished for being tyrants why shouldn't they do
[43:57.420 --> 44:02.220]  this now I'll guarantee you if there's enough of a ruckus over this and enough
[44:02.220 --> 44:06.620]  people speaking out and and and the police will abuse this now that they'll
[44:06.620 --> 44:10.500]  be horror stories from it that it's gonna get reversed if we stand up to it
[44:10.500 --> 44:15.260]  and say no but if we acquiesce why not we're just meet on the table we're a
[44:15.260 --> 44:23.500]  stake on the table as Albert Pike wrote in morals and dogma and so what they're
[44:23.500 --> 44:27.060]  saying here is we can come in your house whatever we want and under the
[44:27.060 --> 44:34.140]  federal grants from Dallas Texas to Boston mass and I've seen articles in
[44:34.140 --> 44:38.020]  every major city in the country where they have something that started a
[44:38.020 --> 44:42.220]  decade ago under federal grants called knocking talk and the cops come and knock
[44:42.220 --> 44:47.460]  knock knock on your door it's almost always a middle-class area and they do
[44:47.460 --> 44:53.340]  it during the day thinking that there's you know a woman a housewife they're
[44:53.340 --> 44:56.780]  running the house they're running the affairs and they come to the door and
[44:56.780 --> 44:59.460]  this has been the Dallas Morning News breaking it down and they asked may I
[44:59.460 --> 45:03.540]  come in and inspect your guns I want to talk to you about your firearms and it's
[45:03.540 --> 45:09.260]  just about getting through that fourth amendment barrier training cops and
[45:09.260 --> 45:13.100]  citizens and the media that it's normal to have a cop come into your house ask
[45:13.100 --> 45:18.500]  gonna come in and see your guns just like they have these highway checkpoints
[45:18.500 --> 45:24.020]  training you all of this is is his acclamation and then suddenly in Chicago
[45:24.020 --> 45:31.780]  in Boston in New York in other cities they go to houses and say we're coming
[45:31.780 --> 45:37.780]  in with this knock and talk we're coming in whether you like it or not we're
[45:37.780 --> 45:42.100]  going to look for guns no warrant so the point here is and I'm going to your phone
[45:42.100 --> 45:53.820]  calls is there is a coordinated overall strategic effort across the board by the
[45:53.820 --> 45:57.140]  federal government and the same things being duplicated standardized in every
[45:57.140 --> 46:02.100]  other industrialized country to break Magna Carta break common law and have
[46:02.100 --> 46:08.500]  police come into homes without warrants started with searching your car without
[46:08.500 --> 46:14.900]  warrants now downloading your laptop when you fly downloading your smartphone it
[46:14.900 --> 46:19.940]  starts with having your kids be asked at school about your parents and the right
[46:19.940 --> 46:23.580]  essays about what's in mommy and daddy's medicine cabinet this is a total
[46:23.580 --> 46:31.540]  conversion of our once free society to absolute classical bonafide certified
[46:31.540 --> 46:37.180]  high-tech tyranny and that's why this radio show is exploding and growing so
[46:37.180 --> 46:43.140]  fast anybody whose research basic history law common sense could do this
[46:43.140 --> 46:48.100]  radio show that's what's so frustrating about this information is that I'm
[46:48.100 --> 46:52.860]  supposedly one of the best people when it comes to knowledge understanding of
[46:52.860 --> 46:59.180]  this and it's so elementary I mean if the police the ruling says for any
[46:59.180 --> 47:02.940]  reason they don't have to give a reason to anybody want to come in your house
[47:02.940 --> 47:09.980]  they can I mean let me read this in the three-two decision just as David Steven
[47:09.980 --> 47:13.340]  David writing for the court said of an officer wants to enter a home for any
[47:13.340 --> 47:17.860]  reason or no reason at all a homeowner cannot do anything to block the
[47:17.860 --> 47:21.940]  officer's entry because under common law if you got some a lunatic without a
[47:21.940 --> 47:27.260]  warrant trying to bust down your door and they don't have probable cause you
[47:27.260 --> 47:32.220]  can resist them with deadly force see cops only have the power a citizen has
[47:32.220 --> 47:36.900]  but over time now you see the states trying to get rid of sheriffs they
[47:36.900 --> 47:41.900]  don't want an actual citizen empowered and deputized by the vote to deputize
[47:41.900 --> 47:46.340]  others they want the bureaucrats to have it see see cops are like wait citizens
[47:46.340 --> 47:49.780]  don't have the same power I do yes we do well see now you're gonna learn about
[47:49.780 --> 47:55.540]  real peace officers the original sheriff going back over a thousand years to that
[47:55.540 --> 48:01.300]  English British system even that is being removed everything is being
[48:01.300 --> 48:05.100]  removed the local authority of the school boards everything's being removed
[48:05.100 --> 48:12.580]  the police are being federalized but if I see someone with pistol whipping a
[48:12.580 --> 48:20.500]  woman some thug with a stocking over their head I as a citizen can go over
[48:20.500 --> 48:25.380]  and shoot them in the head it's not just the citizens arrest it's a citizen's
[48:25.380 --> 48:30.900]  execution under the common law under the Bill of Rights I can go over to the
[48:30.900 --> 48:36.580]  person pistol whipping and assaulting the woman or the man and I can tell them
[48:36.580 --> 48:40.940]  get on the ground if they don't resist I can't arrest them it's like ooh citizens
[48:40.940 --> 48:45.500]  arrest well what do you think it is we the people create the state the state
[48:45.500 --> 48:50.220]  allows counties to be formed as state jurisdictions under the state power of
[48:50.220 --> 48:54.660]  the people and their elected representatives we then elect a sheriff
[48:54.660 --> 48:59.980]  and we decide how to fund him and how many men and women he's going to have we
[48:59.980 --> 49:03.820]  delegate because we're busy milking cows we're busy working at factories we're
[49:03.820 --> 49:10.260]  busy fixing cars we're busy teaching school we're busy you know putting
[49:10.260 --> 49:17.580]  braces on folks we then in complex societies we delegate to our servants
[49:17.580 --> 49:24.220]  what they are to do to protect us and to enforce the laws that we put it into
[49:24.220 --> 49:34.460]  place that's why they have to have a warrant from a judge that we have
[49:34.460 --> 49:39.100]  elected so he is held accountable if he starts writing up warrants that are
[49:39.100 --> 49:42.860]  illegitimate that's one of the reasons we started the war with the British was
[49:42.860 --> 49:46.860]  they were putting out the these these these mass warrants to just search
[49:46.860 --> 49:50.740]  anybody they wanted they were just rubber stamps like the rubber stamps they
[49:50.740 --> 49:59.740]  had to take blood at checkpoints you had to go to a judge and say here's the
[49:59.740 --> 50:03.140]  person here's the things here's the people here specifically what we're
[50:03.140 --> 50:06.940]  looking for and we swear under oath that we have these witnesses and this is what
[50:06.940 --> 50:11.380]  we're going after and the judge says this is a very grave warrant you go back
[50:11.380 --> 50:15.360]  two years ago it was a big deal to issue a warrant and then the constable the
[50:15.360 --> 50:20.500]  sheriff or his deputies would swear yes I swear and they bring in witnesses and
[50:20.500 --> 50:25.940]  they would say witness they didn't have secret informers then okay witness you're
[50:25.940 --> 50:29.420]  gonna be called to the stand if this goes to trial and you're gonna be held
[50:29.420 --> 50:34.420]  in contempt and charged if you bear false witness and lie right now it's
[50:34.420 --> 50:39.300]  called perjury do you understand that yes I promise he's got a body in a trunk
[50:39.300 --> 50:44.780]  in his bedroom okay I'm swearing out this warrant to search that premises it's
[50:44.780 --> 50:48.900]  issued then they go do you realize how big a deal it is to have a Supreme Court
[50:48.900 --> 50:54.660]  of Estates say we don't have to have nothing that is the essence the spirit
[50:54.660 --> 50:58.820]  the heart the blood of tyranny well they ride back with your phone call stay
[50:58.820 --> 51:05.020]  with me going solar for cheap is as easy as 123 if you want to go solar but
[51:05.020 --> 51:08.500]  thought the setup costs were too high now you can build your own solar panels

[52:22.220 --> 52:25.940]  would have been better off getting a job at Walmart or McDonald's than having

[53:04.900 --> 53:08.180]  secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle did you know that in a real
[53:08.180 --> 53:12.180]  meltdown non-hybrid seeds can become more valuable than silver or gold it's
[53:12.180 --> 53:15.620]  true seeds and all perform even gold and silver before in this country and it's
[53:15.620 --> 53:19.580]  possible that could even happen again so our friends at Solutions from Science
[53:19.580 --> 53:24.300]  have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival

[53:57.020 --> 54:01.180]  is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com
[54:01.180 --> 54:16.740]  Indiana also just ruled that the SWAT teams no longer have to get the judge to
[54:16.740 --> 54:22.460]  check off on a no-knock entry so now when they come to serve you a warrant
[54:22.460 --> 54:25.340]  for unpaid parking tickets they're gonna kick the door down they're gonna
[54:25.340 --> 54:28.860]  search everything they're gonna turn the whole thing over what this tells you
[54:28.860 --> 54:32.860]  what this basically telegraphs this is happening all over the country is we've
[54:32.860 --> 54:38.180]  got real hardcore criminals in government who are despots and who know
[54:38.180 --> 54:42.340]  exactly what they're doing and they know they've stole us blind we're going into a
[54:42.340 --> 54:45.900]  bottomless depression they know it's gonna get rough and they're gonna try to
[54:45.900 --> 54:52.260]  ride this out with secret police the whole nine yards and they are hiring I
[54:52.260 --> 54:56.620]  mean I see a lot of cops now that look like they're on drugs you can tell they're
[54:56.620 --> 55:03.380]  on steroids huge black circles around their eyes they look crazy I mean even
[55:03.380 --> 55:06.900]  if you were put on duty walking around with an m16 in New York you would be
[55:06.900 --> 55:10.340]  nice and friendly but just professional you see these cops they look like
[55:10.340 --> 55:15.260]  lunatics I mean that's the last person if I call somebody in for a job interview
[55:15.260 --> 55:18.980]  say for private security in my office and they had big black circles around
[55:18.980 --> 55:27.500]  their eyes and look crazy I mean these are the last people that that that you
[55:27.500 --> 55:33.500]  would want to give power to everybody knows the folks that are all into being
[55:33.500 --> 55:37.500]  tough and they like to watch Chuck Norris movies and they think that they're
[55:37.500 --> 55:42.020]  the ultimate you know fighter and then they actually get in a fight and they
[55:42.020 --> 55:46.420]  got glass jaws or they run and cower I mean you know somebody who's really been
[55:46.420 --> 55:50.540]  in a lot of fights somebody who's tough is not looking for a fight okay and it's
[55:50.540 --> 55:53.940]  not looking for trouble but if you're looking for it you come to the right
[55:53.940 --> 55:58.060]  place you know that's the attitude now that these people have now I said I'd
[55:58.060 --> 56:03.620]  go to your calls I'm I just to read the quote here by Justice Stephen David
[56:03.620 --> 56:11.860]  writing for the court decision he went on to say that police officer wants to
[56:11.860 --> 56:15.620]  enter a home for any reason or no reason at all a homeowner cannot do
[56:15.620 --> 56:22.420]  anything to block the officer's entry and he went on to say the wholesale
[56:22.420 --> 56:27.740]  abrogation of the historic right of a person to reasonably resist unlawful
[56:27.740 --> 56:35.180]  police entry into a dwelling is unwarranted and unnecessarily broad that
[56:35.180 --> 56:41.220]  was in the dissenting decision this is the second major Supreme Court decision
[56:41.220 --> 56:45.980]  Indiana this week including police entry into a home and these these state
[56:45.980 --> 56:49.740]  judges wouldn't have done this unless they are getting the word that the feds
[56:49.740 --> 56:54.380]  are gonna go along with this the feds are saying that unsworn officers can
[56:54.380 --> 57:00.420]  stick their hands down your pants they're not even officers I mean they
[57:00.420 --> 57:04.860]  spy on everybody without warrants now I mean I mean I mean folks I don't mean to
[57:04.860 --> 57:09.300]  belabor this it's just they lie they told you all the cameras were not for
[57:09.300 --> 57:13.260]  surveillance and now they go oopsie they are and they always were of course
[57:13.260 --> 57:23.220]  they were power grab power grab power grab our servants have gotten out of
[57:23.220 --> 57:31.460]  control you see it a lot in examples in history you also see it in the Iliad
[57:31.460 --> 57:36.700]  where Ulysses has been gone for 20 years or whatever it was and he comes back to
[57:36.700 --> 57:40.900]  his palace to his home and everybody's in there drinking his wine they've bank
[57:40.900 --> 57:45.540]  ruptured his wife they've taken over they're pushing his wife around and they
[57:45.540 --> 57:49.420]  just tell him hey get out of here punk and he has to kill them all I mean it's
[57:49.420 --> 57:54.060]  it's it's the oldest story I mean I guarantee it let's say you had two
[57:54.060 --> 57:58.260]  million dollars in the bank and you gave it to a manager just pick from the
[57:58.260 --> 58:01.700]  general public to run your house and your business and you're coming back in
[58:01.700 --> 58:05.020]  ten years and you do whatever you want when you got back they would have had
[58:05.020 --> 58:08.820]  lawyers change corporations over no matter what your agreements were and
[58:08.820 --> 58:12.660]  spend all your money blow your business out of it was even there and tell you

[58:20.740 --> 58:25.180]  mean of course the sky's the limit I'm gonna remind you 11 years ago that
[58:25.180 --> 58:29.100]  declassified this last year a secret agreement was signed with the VA to steal

[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:19.980]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:00:19.980 --> 01:00:28.620]  Alex Jones all right wide open phones in this hour I haven't even gotten into the
[01:00:28.620 --> 01:00:33.860]  big fable and I want to predict some things about a sum of it a lot and his
[01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:39.100]  death the supposed latest killing coming up after I take some of your calls we
[01:00:39.100 --> 01:00:43.100]  got a state rep joining us who's fighting with TSA successfully a lot of
[01:00:43.100 --> 01:00:46.060]  exciting things happening are really scary things going on with Fukushima
[01:00:46.060 --> 01:00:51.060]  they've had multiple total meltdowns partial meltdowns more explosions now
[01:00:51.060 --> 01:00:55.300]  they're going to put up giant tents that's been announced so you can't see
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:59.260]  what's going on but they've admitted it may go on for years and the radiation is
[01:00:59.260 --> 01:01:05.580]  just piling up in the US just smoke coming across building up you see it
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:11.580]  builds up and they say it builds up and so the feds answer is just raise the
[01:01:11.580 --> 01:01:17.580]  safe level of what they say we can be exposed to see these con artists drink
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:24.780]  their own Kool-Aid I think they control reality by waving their magic I was
[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:28.420]  about to say something obnoxious let's go ahead and talk to Tate and Florida
[01:01:28.420 --> 01:01:34.820]  you're on the air Tate hey Alex thank you very much for taking my call and I
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:39.620]  want to thank you for all the hard work that you've been that you're doing in
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:43.260]  protecting America and her rights well let's get one thing clear I'm not I look
[01:01:43.260 --> 01:01:46.620]  I'm not doing this because I'm a nice guy I don't like being run by a bunch of
[01:01:46.620 --> 01:01:52.020]  criminal bullies I'm doing this for me and my family and I realized if I'm
[01:01:52.020 --> 01:01:55.140]  gonna be free you got to be free but the point is at the end of the day it's
[01:01:55.140 --> 01:01:59.820]  selfishness let's get that straight go ahead absolutely well I just wanted to
[01:01:59.820 --> 01:02:04.100]  have a question I'd like to get to a little bit but I've been listening your
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:08.940]  show now for about two weeks and it's completely changed I've always kind of
[01:02:08.940 --> 01:02:12.220]  had a little bit of apprehension towards obviously the government and just
[01:02:12.220 --> 01:02:17.980]  the what what we're fed in general the Osama bin Laden thing kind of awakened
[01:02:17.980 --> 01:02:24.260]  me and they got me to start listening to your show I can't even find my I find
[01:02:24.260 --> 01:02:28.060]  myself not even being able to watch TV anymore I've been starting to read yeah
[01:02:28.060 --> 01:02:33.500]  once you're awake it is a cartoonish level assault and we'll drive you crazy
[01:02:33.500 --> 01:02:37.620]  I mean you know I mean I that's why I'm so obnoxious because I'm sick of this I
[01:02:37.620 --> 01:02:42.500]  don't like this I don't like having to focus on these rats all day and look at
[01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:48.260]  Chuckie Schumer and look at Obama and look at mr. global warning mr. New
[01:02:48.260 --> 01:02:51.860]  World Order Newt Gennrich and hear Republican talk show house talk about
[01:02:51.860 --> 01:02:55.460]  how conservative he is the guys about as conservative as Mao say tongue I'm
[01:02:55.460 --> 01:03:00.380]  sorry oh it's a joke I mean I can't even imagine what must be like for you like
[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:04.700]  I said I've only been doing it for two weeks and it just it really angers me
[01:03:04.700 --> 01:03:10.940]  and I try not to get angry about it but it is very frustrating but basically the
[01:03:10.940 --> 01:03:15.380]  question that I wanted to get to and I wanted to call in yesterday with Dr.
[01:03:15.380 --> 01:03:20.260]  Pachinic but I wasn't able to he's a great American he's a great man however
[01:03:20.260 --> 01:03:28.020]  there's something that I just find odd he he claims you know he was working for
[01:03:28.020 --> 01:03:32.380]  four or five presidential administrations he was working in for you know
[01:03:32.380 --> 01:03:39.300]  several decades in intelligence around the world for America in black ops he
[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:44.540]  says that he has still very good friends in the intelligence community around the
[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:49.620]  world working for America and he also says that you know Secretary Gates and
[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:55.500]  General Petraeus are good men and that he expects them to do well in their you
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:04:00.980]  know obviously the chance of new position as CIA director what I just don't
[01:04:00.980 --> 01:04:04.740]  understand he claims that these are good men and I'm not saying that Pachinic's
[01:04:04.740 --> 01:04:09.660]  not a good man but it seems like what they're doing is selling America down
[01:04:09.660 --> 01:04:13.060]  the river that they know that they're doing it they're working for black ops
[01:04:13.060 --> 01:04:16.660]  they know that they're that they're putting up these false flag operation
[01:04:16.660 --> 01:04:20.340]  they know that they're doing these things that are going to destroy America
[01:04:20.340 --> 01:04:25.860]  and hardly any of them speak out and I don't understand how it is but it just
[01:04:25.860 --> 01:04:31.220]  seems inherently evil to me it just seems like they are they are selling us
[01:04:31.220 --> 01:04:38.020]  out and they know that they are but they they don't say anything this is a very
[01:04:38.020 --> 01:04:41.100]  complex question I'm gonna answer when we come back I appreciate your call great
[01:04:41.100 --> 01:04:47.540]  points tape and I'm gonna get to Bill Judy Marty Mitchell and others these are
[01:04:47.540 --> 01:04:54.900]  all wonderful points and I'm gonna try to simply and succinctly answer it on the
[01:04:54.900 --> 01:05:02.140]  other side well they're right back stay with us this is Alex Jones with five
[01:05:02.140 --> 01:05:06.340]  good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:10.140]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[01:05:10.140 --> 01:05:14.500]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows

[01:05:18.860 --> 01:05:23.300]  smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the
[01:05:23.300 --> 01:05:28.060]  power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:31.860]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:35.500]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:05:35.500 --> 01:05:39.820]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[01:07:00.780 --> 01:07:05.580]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[01:07:05.580 --> 01:07:11.100]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:14.500]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I've turned a
[01:07:14.500 --> 01:07:19.140]  tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling
[01:07:19.140 --> 01:07:24.420]  the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[01:07:24.420 --> 01:07:28.940]  attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[01:07:28.940 --> 01:07:33.660]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[01:07:33.660 --> 01:07:37.680]  constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and arsonists they're
[01:07:37.680 --> 01:07:41.380]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to?
[01:07:41.380 --> 01:07:46.460]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen
[01:07:46.460 --> 01:07:53.500]  a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com

[01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:12.740]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:20.300]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:33.140]  Alex Jones. All right Bill, Judy, Marty, Mitchell, Lance, others your calls coming
[01:08:33.140 --> 01:08:37.580]  up more on Ron Paul announcing this morning he is running for president.
[01:08:37.580 --> 01:08:41.060]  They're trying to demonize him because he pointed out well if they did kill
[01:08:41.060 --> 01:08:46.420]  bin Laden this was illegal. It is illegal. Let's say bin Laden is the greatest
[01:08:46.420 --> 01:08:53.060]  demon on earth there let's say he did 9-11 for the sake of debate. We need to
[01:08:53.060 --> 01:08:59.380]  have a trial so the facts come out. Trials are also investigations out of a
[01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:06.820]  lot of criminal trials other prosecutions come. See when the system doesn't want to
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:11.060]  trial they're hiding something. When the system wants to torture people it's
[01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:15.340]  because they want fake confessions that's the only reason torture pays off and
[01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:19.940]  every historian every military expert will tell you that. I know that's why
[01:09:19.940 --> 01:09:22.500]  you've heard it a million times torture is no good except for false
[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:30.580]  confessions and so Ron Paul doesn't play politics he tells you what he really
[01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:34.020]  believes he stands with the Bill of Rights and Constitution so he didn't
[01:09:34.020 --> 01:09:38.900]  say oh I think it's great we killed him he said well it broke the law we should
[01:09:38.900 --> 01:09:43.540]  have picked him up and had a trial now if he resisted that's a different now
[01:09:43.540 --> 01:09:48.260]  they say he didn't if you're going to pick somebody up for trial they try to
[01:09:48.260 --> 01:09:54.220]  kill you well then you you you kill them but this is different they do not want
[01:09:54.220 --> 01:09:57.940]  a trial and again people email me and say now you're saying the fables true
[01:09:57.940 --> 01:10:02.940]  no I'm saying for the sake of debate Ron Paul is going along you know with the
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:07.420]  official narrative because he can't prove it one way or the other I'll
[01:10:07.420 --> 01:10:16.420]  guarantee you that's his real position and so he gets questioned and he says
[01:10:16.420 --> 01:10:23.100]  look it was illegal now now again why do we have a trial because we'd learn
[01:10:23.100 --> 01:10:26.860]  from other societies how horrible it is when there isn't a trial because the
[01:10:26.860 --> 01:10:31.900]  system can just grab you they set the precedent with some unpopular guy like
[01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:36.540]  bin Laden and then it happens to you and yours just like the Indiana Supreme
[01:10:36.540 --> 01:10:41.100]  Court ruling quote a police officer could enter a home for any reason or no
[01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:46.380]  reason at all the Fourth Amendment is dead other judges in the dissenting
[01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:56.500]  opinion said Justice Robert Rucker and Justice Dixon they say this this kills
[01:10:56.500 --> 01:11:00.540]  the Fourth Amendment and then the other judge says well it is an ancient right
[01:11:00.540 --> 01:11:07.460]  to have a warrant but it's gone hey the these judges are proud of themselves but
[01:11:07.460 --> 01:11:14.500]  I'm digressing I want to answer the last caller's question it's just that don't
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:20.060]  you want a trial don't you want to have him publicly interrogated don't you not
[01:11:20.060 --> 01:11:26.340]  want to kill him so you can get intel and if I don't get to it later guys
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:30.820]  remind me I've got to get to this I want to make a prediction now of the
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:36.300]  hundreds of thumb drives in the eight hard drives and all of this garbage they
[01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:41.500]  supposedly found you're going to see the same Pentagon funded front groups site
[01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:45.780]  group and Intel Center who've been caught putting out fake videos before on
[01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:50.380]  record the media says oh they're totally independent they get all the bin Laden
[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:54.660]  videos don't want to ask how do you get them why have you been caught faking
[01:11:54.660 --> 01:11:59.020]  them that you are now going to see in fact I'm last night I meant to do a
[01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:03.020]  video on this a YouTube but I didn't get around to it I left early so I had
[01:12:03.020 --> 01:12:07.100]  some business I had to take care of predicting that we're gonna hear that
[01:12:07.100 --> 01:12:12.460]  bin Laden had a beef with Obama that way Obama can make his campaign all about
[01:12:12.460 --> 01:12:18.420]  how Osama was after me but Obama got him and they're gonna say oh look the hard
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:24.380]  drives show the plan to carry out 9-11 here's all the proof and plans to nuke
[01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:28.580]  nuclear reactors that's out today I mean I just know how these people work I
[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:31.940]  know them better than they know themselves because I study them so hard
[01:12:31.940 --> 01:12:38.780]  they're just unconsciously running around engaging in their crimes and sure
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:46.020]  enough Osama bin Laden wanted to kill President Obama kind of like Saddam
[01:12:46.020 --> 01:12:51.460]  wanted to kill George Robert Walker Bush so George W. God even just a made-up
[01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:59.500]  story so they can personalize it so now Obama who wasn't even in office nine
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:03.220]  years ago when this happened wasn't even in the federal government when this
[01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:08.340]  happened now this this writes himself into the story how he's this big hero
[01:13:08.340 --> 01:13:12.780]  and he's got al-Qaeda after him and who they mess with Obama and you saw what
[01:13:12.780 --> 01:13:20.100]  happened oh yeah so so I want to predict they're gonna have the full 9-11
[01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:25.060]  battle plan how they did it who they were and it'll prove 9-11 isn't an
[01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:30.740]  inside job of course the same government not one but two passports fell
[01:13:30.740 --> 01:13:35.940]  magically in fact I've got a shoot a special report on this magically fell
[01:13:35.940 --> 01:13:40.420]  out of the aircraft and within three hours were found in two separate
[01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:45.060]  occasions by the FBI millions and millions that's a conservative number
[01:13:45.060 --> 01:13:51.900]  you look like billions I don't know tens of thousands of file cabinets blown wide
[01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:57.780]  open paper everywhere five six feet deep of paper and dust and magically not one
[01:13:57.780 --> 01:14:03.420]  but two passports one of them undamaged are found in the rubble total
[01:14:03.420 --> 01:14:08.820]  badlam has broken loose absolute hell dead everywhere collapse three giant
[01:14:08.820 --> 01:14:15.420]  towers feet of dust on the ground papers everywhere and on the hijackers
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:19.180]  other passports and they go into the building the fireball and come out and
[01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:23.900]  one of them unscathed and then magically get picked up the first day now if you
[01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:28.620]  believe that ladies and gentlemen you believe in unicorns pixies Easter
[01:14:28.620 --> 01:14:39.020]  bunnies the Loch Ness monster the Santa Claus Mrs. Claus bigfoot garden gnomes
[01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:46.740]  Count Dracula Frankenstein I mean it zombies it's not true it's impossible
[01:14:46.740 --> 01:14:51.020]  oh and of course they got the passport at flight 93 to but the whole plane
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:56.580]  disappeared was blown up by F-16s firing sidewinders into it and that even came
[01:14:56.580 --> 01:15:00.300]  out it's just them I said I'd go to your calls and I'm not doing it I'm not
[01:15:00.300 --> 01:15:04.020]  doing it I haven't gotten to the last question of Tate who I'll have to recap
[01:15:04.020 --> 01:15:08.020]  for folks that just joined us but if the hair lips the admiral I'll get to bill
[01:15:08.020 --> 01:15:16.740]  Judy Marnie Michael Lance if the water doesn't rise over Bear Creek that's more
[01:15:16.740 --> 01:15:25.500]  politically correct way of saying that I just can't handle it anymore
[01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:30.780]  I just I mean I'm living in the real world folks so so oh and then they found
[01:15:30.780 --> 01:15:35.660]  hijackers bags out of all the bags that could get lost one of the hijackers bag
[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:40.500]  with uniforms and admissions and photos and plans and they found another car
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:47.660]  with all the plans in it I mean the evidence of the crime is the evidence
[01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:51.620]  of the frame up and then you get into all the other pieces of it but you watch
[01:15:51.620 --> 01:15:57.940]  they are going to release the plans for 9-eleven watch it in fact I have to go
[01:15:57.940 --> 01:16:00.980]  over a whole list of these I wrote these down last night and they didn't even
[01:16:00.980 --> 01:16:04.980]  bring them to work today I wrote like 20 plus points that I'm predicting they're
[01:16:04.980 --> 01:16:08.220]  gonna bring out of this intelligence and they're so arrogant they're gonna still
[01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:15.740]  bring it out even though I've called them on it mark my words the battle plan
[01:16:15.740 --> 01:16:21.020]  for 9-eleven will be released right before the election unless this shows
[01:16:21.020 --> 01:16:24.100]  gotten so big now that we ruin it for him and we did ruin Bush rolling out
[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:29.340]  bin Laden in 2004 when Madeline Albright and others picked up on it okay let me
[01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:32.420]  answer the question of Tate and don't feel bad callers I got you on hold us
[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:34.940]  look at all the time I'm spending answering Tate's question it's a very
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:37.540]  important question I almost forgot to get to it
[01:16:37.540 --> 01:16:42.900]  that's how my brain is jumping around Tate called in and he said look I'm sure
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:47.180]  Dr. Pachennik's a great guy's great patriot but he's in black ops
[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:52.420]  overthrowing governments doing all these things if you know these guys have
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:56.620]  got to know that this overall system is evil how can he say the Secretary Gates
[01:16:56.620 --> 01:17:04.700]  is good how can he say Petraeus is good I call it the buddy syndrome Albert
[01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:09.980]  Spear the German Interior Minister
[01:17:11.900 --> 01:17:16.140]  look up Albert Spear was he the in I forget his exact title he was overall
[01:17:16.140 --> 01:17:18.940]  the architecture in Germany and infrastructure but I believe it was
[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:26.260]  Interior Minister look up Albert Spear Nazi Germany Nazi official I want to
[01:17:26.260 --> 01:17:30.860]  side-issue I want to make sure I'm fact-twitted correctly on that said that
[01:17:30.860 --> 01:17:40.060]  they asked him later they said why didn't why didn't you know that that Hitler
[01:17:40.060 --> 01:17:43.660]  was a bad guy and he said when the devils got his hand around you pat me on
[01:17:43.660 --> 01:17:47.540]  the back telling you how much he loves you you don't recognize it's the devil
[01:17:47.540 --> 01:17:50.700]  and they pulled up in the encyclopedia chief architect I know he was
[01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:55.980]  architect of the Reich but at the end he was also given I believe it was
[01:17:55.980 --> 01:18:02.980]  Interior Minister but minister of armaments he was a bunch of stuff okay
[01:18:02.980 --> 01:18:13.420]  thank you but continuing what Pachennik this is such a complex issue because
[01:18:13.420 --> 01:18:18.060]  this goes to the very nature of good and evil this goes to the very nature of
[01:18:18.060 --> 01:18:23.180]  of black white and all those grays in between the point is it isn't about if
[01:18:23.180 --> 01:18:29.980]  Pachennik is some lily of the field or whether he's a dark Diablo the issue is
[01:18:29.980 --> 01:18:34.020]  he is a high-powered insider coming out and saying 9-11's an inside job and
[01:18:34.020 --> 01:18:37.780]  he's coming out and saying to bin Laden things fake and he's been on record for
[01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:42.300]  almost 10 years with that and he's been proven correct obviously he is from
[01:18:42.300 --> 01:18:50.300]  that system and so it's not a judgment about who he is that's for God to decide
[01:18:50.300 --> 01:18:55.420]  and we don't know his whole history his life's on an open book to us and so yes
[01:18:55.420 --> 01:19:01.580]  when he's saying that Bush is horrible Obama's horrible he's saying he's
[01:19:01.580 --> 01:19:06.500]  saying George Herbert Walker Bush compared to them wouldn't carry out of 9-11
[01:19:06.500 --> 01:19:10.540]  you know he worked with George Bush he says he admires him because he wasn't a
[01:19:10.540 --> 01:19:16.740]  narcissist and was secretive and liked to do things behind the scenes he's
[01:19:16.740 --> 01:19:21.060]  worked a lot with Gates he worked with him overthrowing the Soviets Pachennik
[01:19:21.060 --> 01:19:25.260]  hates communist he's proud of what he did he was sitting there talking about
[01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:29.740]  you know the great work in Indonesia fighting communism and his argument
[01:19:29.740 --> 01:19:32.660]  would be well the communists would kill even more you know if we didn't do what
[01:19:32.660 --> 01:19:38.780]  we did that's the nature of fighting fire with fire don't look into the abyss
[01:19:38.780 --> 01:19:43.060]  lest you become the abyss the point is judging Pachennik one way or the other
[01:19:43.060 --> 01:19:48.740]  he has courage he's high-powered he's an insider he's here giving us intel okay
[01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:54.540]  so take the information for what it's worth and make your own decisions you
[01:19:54.540 --> 01:19:57.620]  know I had Vincent Boogliose on I don't agree with a lot of what he stands for
[01:19:57.620 --> 01:20:00.620]  you understand that we'll be right back

[01:24:00.140 --> 01:24:12.100]  here's my final point on Pachennik the caller Tate earlier said why don't Robert
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:17.900]  Gates and Betray has come out and say 9-11's an inside job if they're good
[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:24.260]  guys like Pachennik saying you know for me the the the the the totality of what
[01:24:24.260 --> 01:24:29.340]  Pachennik was talking about is he's dealing with bin Laden and stage terror
[01:24:29.340 --> 01:24:34.380]  and future stage terror it's a side issue that he thinks those guys were
[01:24:34.380 --> 01:24:39.780]  honorable because he worked with him and he was compartmentalized and saw that
[01:24:39.780 --> 01:24:46.620]  perspective I mean overall it's a distraction from the issues but then the
[01:24:46.620 --> 01:24:49.820]  caller said well why don't they go public well here's Pachennik going
[01:24:49.820 --> 01:24:56.300]  public and he's being criticized because he came from that corrupt system and
[01:24:56.300 --> 01:25:03.380]  he's not completely attacking the entire system so that's why a lot of folks
[01:25:03.380 --> 01:25:07.780]  don't ever come out of the New World Order or come out of this corrupt system
[01:25:07.780 --> 01:25:12.820]  because they know they're not gonna get a very friendly welcome once they do it's
[01:25:12.820 --> 01:25:17.740]  kind of like you made your bed now sleep in it that's why it's very important in
[01:25:17.740 --> 01:25:21.980]  life to watch the decisions you make watch who you get in bed with because
[01:25:21.980 --> 01:25:26.420]  there's a point no return and if you've done the right things in life and made
[01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:30.300]  the right decisions doesn't mean you're perfect it's a good feeling to be past
[01:25:30.300 --> 01:25:34.860]  the point no return and it's a mental illusion that there's a point of no
[01:25:34.860 --> 01:25:39.340]  return when it comes to going from evil to good Pachennik would argue he's
[01:25:39.340 --> 01:25:42.660]  proud of what he's done fighting communist and that they were you know
[01:25:42.660 --> 01:25:47.780]  evil and wicked and he had to you know fight dirty to defeat them but you see
[01:25:47.780 --> 01:25:53.540]  how that attitude may get things done but leads to where we are today and I
[01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:56.020]  can have that academic discussion when the next time he's on I'll bring that
[01:25:56.020 --> 01:25:58.900]  up to him that will take your calls you're able to call in and talk to him
[01:25:58.900 --> 01:26:02.460]  Bill in Wisconsin then Judy Marty Michael Lance everybody else I'm gonna
[01:26:02.460 --> 01:26:04.780]  start trying to get through these a little bit quicker now of course you know
[01:26:04.780 --> 01:26:12.260]  I won't but Bill in Wisconsin you're on the air hey Alex do across the board I
[01:26:12.260 --> 01:26:17.900]  know you don't want to I just I want to beat a dead horse what the thing I have
[01:26:17.900 --> 01:26:21.620]  a problem with and I love all the information the guy's you know he's a
[01:26:21.620 --> 01:26:28.220]  top spy master in Intel and everything and 98 percent of everything he said is
[01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:33.540]  just unbelievable and then then when he comes up at the very end and says that
[01:26:33.540 --> 01:26:39.260]  George W. Bush is is a statesman that's really where I start to question like
[01:26:39.260 --> 01:26:42.740]  what is his mode what are his actual motives is he the person out there
[01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:46.500]  trying to give you information and let you know this is what's going on I mean
[01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:50.540]  well my mother my mother one and my dad went with us to the beach to go fishing
[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:54.060]  last weekend and she said to me while we were sitting there you know on the
[01:26:54.060 --> 01:27:01.220]  beach building sandcastles with the kids what I already knew basically the Brent
[01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:09.500]  Scrocoff George Herbert Walker George Schultz James Baker group was sent in
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:13.140]  the last two years the Bush administration to take over and to kind of
[01:27:13.140 --> 01:27:16.180]  kick the neocons out because the neocons at the time were writing
[01:27:16.180 --> 01:27:20.020]  editorials calling for a new 9-11 I mean they were getting ready and the
[01:27:20.020 --> 01:27:23.900]  establishment said look this this is too out of control you're discrediting our
[01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:29.820]  whole system and so Pachennik is a manifestation of that older guard
[01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:34.500]  basically going look it's false flag terror the bin Laden things fake we're
[01:27:34.500 --> 01:27:39.980]  sick of it the folks are incompetent that are in Washington and and and it's
[01:27:39.980 --> 01:27:46.380]  almost the old guards disdain for the more ham-fisted new guys and so yes that
[01:27:46.380 --> 01:27:50.860]  was a message from the establishment to and that's what he said he said this is
[01:27:50.860 --> 01:27:54.700]  going to the White House I want you to hear this I want you to know don't do
[01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:59.420]  the false flag don't start the new wars we need to end these wars we're going
[01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:04.340]  bankrupt this is just more old guard that realize soft power and don't want
[01:28:04.340 --> 01:28:08.340]  to destroy the entire system what do you think dr. Paul Craig Roberts is he's
[01:28:08.340 --> 01:28:13.660]  super high-powered in all those big elite groups they realize that that the
[01:28:13.660 --> 01:28:17.340]  people running the system are gonna run it over a cliff you know the globalists
[01:28:17.340 --> 01:28:20.500]  have this idea of wrecking everything and then they're gonna get all the
[01:28:20.500 --> 01:28:24.100]  goodies if they totally burn the whole system down there's gonna be nothing for
[01:28:24.100 --> 01:28:31.220]  anybody but you know Pachennik was a ground operator but but you know one of
[01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:35.660]  those guys that was a general who also was on the front lines you know a jack
[01:28:35.660 --> 01:28:40.180]  of all trades a Renaissance man and and and he's proud of what he's done I mean
[01:28:40.180 --> 01:28:45.660]  he's one of those old Cold Warrior types it's a different breed than just
[01:28:45.660 --> 01:28:50.740]  Chicago mafia and ballet dancers and you know they're gay escorts and all the
[01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:55.900]  everybody prancing around and it's not saying they're even good you know the
[01:28:55.900 --> 01:29:01.140]  point is is that it's powerful information he's a big insider so so
[01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:04.540]  having Pachennik on isn't an endorsement of the Cold War it isn't an
[01:29:04.540 --> 01:29:10.260]  endorsement it's it's it's a window into things unseen do you see what I'm
[01:29:10.260 --> 01:29:15.620]  saying I understand completely I just want to say for new listeners out there
[01:29:15.620 --> 01:29:18.860]  who are just having a hard time swallowing all this once you come to
[01:29:18.860 --> 01:29:24.340]  realization that your your your birth certificate is traded online publicly
[01:29:24.340 --> 01:29:29.740]  it's your your blood being taken taken at birth for for the UN once you come
[01:29:29.740 --> 01:29:33.580]  there's realization it's a very very scary but you have no choice once you're
[01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:37.140]  back in the corner if I mean you've got it you got to come out swinging and I'd
[01:29:37.140 --> 01:29:41.940]  like to always say quote Mark Twain with the fear of death follows from the
[01:29:41.940 --> 01:29:47.140]  fear of life a man who lives fully is prepared to die at any time so once you
[01:29:47.140 --> 01:29:52.660]  get past that that helpless feeling well said well said we're on the march the

[01:35:35.340 --> 01:35:40.140]  authors the bill and co-authored it plus a large number of voters and
[01:35:40.140 --> 01:35:45.660]  overwhelmingly in a voice vote to pass it on second reading so today this
[01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:51.060]  afternoon will God willing will pass it on third reading and then it'll go to
[01:35:51.060 --> 01:35:55.900]  the Senate and I'm very hopeful that the measure will be passed there well as
[01:35:55.900 --> 01:36:00.340]  well and then go to the governor I am expecting his support on the bill
[01:36:00.340 --> 01:36:06.340]  mentioned it in a couple of times and do not anticipate any opposition the fact
[01:36:06.340 --> 01:36:15.380]  it goes along with the fed up campaign now I certainly this is a very reasonable
[01:36:15.380 --> 01:36:21.820]  to be fed up with people touching this just innocent travelers in our private
[01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:27.820]  areas and so we're just saying that you know the Fourth Amendment is being
[01:36:27.820 --> 01:36:32.100]  forced and we're saying that it and here in Texas that it's unreasonable to
[01:36:32.100 --> 01:36:36.860]  touch people on their private parts without probable cause as a condition of
[01:36:36.860 --> 01:36:41.340]  travel or the condition of entering a public building such as the Capitol this
[01:36:41.340 --> 01:36:45.700]  is saying we're guilty until proven innocent have you seen the new video of
[01:36:45.700 --> 01:36:50.020]  the six-year-old with the woman's hand down her pants of the one-year-old baby
[01:36:50.020 --> 01:36:55.180]  with them checking in the diaper I mean this is this is a joke it is we've gone
[01:36:55.180 --> 01:37:00.980]  from you know prudent caution to ridiculous excess so we're saying here
[01:37:00.980 --> 01:37:06.740]  in Texas this is where we're drawing the line and I am very hopeful with that
[01:37:06.740 --> 01:37:11.180]  it'll stop some of this nonsense what about enforcement I mean if this passes
[01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:15.220]  and becomes the law are you gonna have undercover state police sitting at
[01:37:15.220 --> 01:37:19.860]  Berkstrom and if they see the groping of the genitals because it's confirmed
[01:37:19.860 --> 01:37:24.820]  they squeezed it's just to identify what it is they make women go behind closed
[01:37:24.820 --> 01:37:29.540]  doors and remove menstrual pads that's on record I mean this is like induction
[01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:36.100]  into a maximum security prison what about enforcement if this passes how are
[01:37:36.100 --> 01:37:41.660]  we gonna enforce this well first of all I hope they'll change their
[01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:47.540]  instruction there is no federal statute requiring this to my knowledge and so I
[01:37:47.540 --> 01:37:52.020]  think that's the first thing that'll change and secondly as far as enforcement
[01:37:52.020 --> 01:37:58.060]  of the attorney general will have some jurisdiction and I hope it doesn't have
[01:37:58.060 --> 01:38:02.660]  to be enforced I hope they'll just stop it it applies not only to the federal
[01:38:02.660 --> 01:38:07.620]  agents but it also applies their own DPS and so it applies to anyone seeking
[01:38:07.620 --> 01:38:15.420]  access public transportation or a public building well it's amazing
[01:38:15.420 --> 01:38:22.060]  dealing with this and talking to DA's isn't it already illegal for a sworn
[01:38:22.060 --> 01:38:25.380]  peace officer to stick their hands down somebody's pants or grab their genitals
[01:38:25.380 --> 01:38:30.300]  say at a traffic stop unless they see someone shove drugs or a gun that's an
[01:38:30.300 --> 01:38:33.340]  imminent threat in their pants according to the DA's I've interviewed
[01:38:33.340 --> 01:38:37.580]  representative it's already illegal I mean there's already statutes to charge
[01:38:37.580 --> 01:38:40.860]  police so why not just go ahead and start enforcing their the existing
[01:38:40.860 --> 01:38:46.620]  statutes or is this law just a further you know codifying common sense and you
[01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:51.740]  know trying to get the attention of the feds well it's certainly common sense
[01:38:51.740 --> 01:38:56.260]  it's really something that we should be surprised that we've allowed this to go
[01:38:56.260 --> 01:39:02.300]  on so far it is true I mean the DPS troopers can't do what these TSA people
[01:39:02.300 --> 01:39:06.900]  are doing and you know I think they get away with it because we let them get
[01:39:06.900 --> 01:39:13.300]  away with it and we just need to start saying no and this is that the travelers
[01:39:13.300 --> 01:39:18.620]  don't have an option right now and so this is how the states should stand up
[01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:24.580]  for their citizens and interpose when there's unreasonable searches and this is
[01:39:24.580 --> 01:39:30.260]  a good place to start well let me expand a naked body scanners thank God there's
[01:39:30.260 --> 01:39:36.500]  a move in the house to cut their funding people need to put pressure on the
[01:39:36.500 --> 01:39:41.180]  Senate now but but but but here in Texas obviously people need to call their
[01:39:41.180 --> 01:39:45.860]  state senators and say look we want this we want this past we want this move to
[01:39:45.860 --> 01:39:50.940]  the head of the line in the legislature but they the TSA says if you
[01:39:50.940 --> 01:39:56.260]  don't like a grope down then go in the microwave oven the scanners that I have
[01:39:56.260 --> 01:40:01.060]  sat there in multiple airports in California and other areas and witness
[01:40:01.060 --> 01:40:05.380]  them send women and children predominantly through scanners and then
[01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:10.100]  they get the additional groping and I know this has happened to Jesse Ventura
[01:40:10.100 --> 01:40:15.060]  in front of me former governor of Minnesota I know Ron Paul a congressman
[01:40:15.060 --> 01:40:19.220]  presidential candidates confirm it's happened to him after the scanners so
[01:40:19.220 --> 01:40:22.420]  that's a red herring and I'm sure they've tried to use that on you well hey you
[01:40:22.420 --> 01:40:25.740]  don't like the groping go through the scanners well that's right I mean they
[01:40:25.740 --> 01:40:30.220]  actually forced my son and my wife they were standing in line to go through the
[01:40:30.220 --> 01:40:34.220]  metal detector and they got there in plenty of time and they told them that
[01:40:34.220 --> 01:40:37.900]  but they said well you have to come they forced them out of that line to go to
[01:40:37.900 --> 01:40:45.260]  the scanner and my wife refused to she's got some medical issues and she didn't
[01:40:45.260 --> 01:40:50.420]  want any more radiation and or to be staying naked and all that and so the
[01:40:50.420 --> 01:40:55.980]  only alternative is to be broke and it's not a pat down as a euphemism it's a
[01:40:55.980 --> 01:40:59.780]  rub down they go up and down you'll inside of your legs twice touching your
[01:40:59.780 --> 01:41:05.660]  groin air and lift up your breast they go on a pat them down it's just excessive
[01:41:05.660 --> 01:41:10.940]  and here's what really just there may as we were taking testimony on this there
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:18.020]  was a young boy from Oklahoma and his mother who were separated in one of
[01:41:18.020 --> 01:41:24.100]  these churches and this autistic boy when he was being patted down so called
[01:41:24.100 --> 01:41:29.540]  her broke he started yelling stranger danger stranger danger man on boy
[01:41:29.540 --> 01:41:37.260]  man on boy and that brings out the real sense of it if an autistic boy he's been
[01:41:37.260 --> 01:41:45.140]  taught to protect these areas to figure this out why can't we see what we've
[01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:50.100]  done we're taking away people's dignity their privacy and we're limiting their
[01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:54.860]  freedom the government should keep us from harming one another it shouldn't
[01:41:54.860 --> 01:42:01.420]  harm us and it should protect our freedom protect our dignity absolutely for
[01:42:01.420 --> 01:42:05.940]  those that don't have the disabled children they have to train them
[01:42:05.940 --> 01:42:09.380]  especially about abuse because that's who abusers target because they're
[01:42:09.380 --> 01:42:13.180]  unable to articulate the abuse they've gone through as well and that reminds
[01:42:13.180 --> 01:42:19.780]  me representative David Simpson from here in Texas of the Bible verse out of
[01:42:19.780 --> 01:42:23.860]  the mouths of babes I mean if an autistic child knows this is wrong well
[01:42:23.860 --> 01:42:27.780]  I mean what about my children I've trained them nobody touches you not at
[01:42:27.780 --> 01:42:32.180]  school not anybody even if extended family touches you you tell me about it
[01:42:32.180 --> 01:42:36.020]  later and then my children watch TV they listen to the radio they hear me and
[01:42:36.020 --> 01:42:40.860]  they go daddy are the men in uniforms gonna touch me and now it scares you
[01:42:40.860 --> 01:42:45.140]  make children fear police does it not a representative it does and even
[01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:48.780]  representatives I have one representative here who travels from El Paso
[01:42:48.780 --> 01:42:53.820]  every week and they forced him to either go through the scanner or to be growth
[01:42:53.820 --> 01:42:59.900]  and he hurt his foot so now they're shoving stuff down his cast and with
[01:42:59.900 --> 01:43:05.980]  the to make sure he doesn't have a bomb the message is we're all criminals
[01:43:05.980 --> 01:43:09.060]  unless you're the federal government and then we see all this crime with the
[01:43:09.060 --> 01:43:13.900]  TSA who goes through almost no screening sir why do you in closing why do you
[01:43:13.900 --> 01:43:17.940]  think the feds and shirt off who made some of the money from this why do you
[01:43:17.940 --> 01:43:20.820]  think they're attempting to do this I mean I see it as a federal power grab
[01:43:20.820 --> 01:43:25.220]  what's the jurisdiction and now the feds want to be at train stations bus
[01:43:25.220 --> 01:43:31.340]  stations they've run federal checkpoints with TSA train people I mean and for me
[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:35.940]  this is a giant federal power grab what's your view I can't speak to their
[01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:40.540]  motives I mean I think the issue with respect to protecting us from terrorists
[01:43:40.540 --> 01:43:44.260]  it's important but if we look back at where have the terrorists been stopped
[01:43:44.260 --> 01:43:48.740]  they've been stopped by individuals exercising their self-defense that's
[01:43:48.740 --> 01:43:54.220]  the first and foremost way to deal with people who harm us as our own ability
[01:43:54.220 --> 01:43:58.060]  to defend ourselves and not the government many times there's no ten
[01:43:58.060 --> 01:44:04.260]  fifteen twenty minutes away that's what we need to focus on and we need to allow
[01:44:04.260 --> 01:44:08.700]  that well that's right more and more like with the the Colorado case where the
[01:44:08.700 --> 01:44:11.300]  guy came in to shoot everybody in the church and the woman had the gun and
[01:44:11.300 --> 01:44:16.860]  killed him right there in closing taking this testimony what can we do to make
[01:44:16.860 --> 01:44:21.140]  sure that this gets passed in Texas leads the way from tyranny back into
[01:44:21.140 --> 01:44:28.940]  liberty a and b any other poignant stories that you took in testimony well
[01:44:28.940 --> 01:44:32.780]  first thing is you can call your senator it's better to for the
[01:44:32.780 --> 01:44:36.900]  constituent to call their own senator and not just the whole host of moldo
[01:44:36.900 --> 01:44:42.140]  that certainly welcome to and then to also contact the governor we've had
[01:44:42.140 --> 01:44:46.260]  support for this bill and then the other one that didn't get passed that it did
[01:44:46.260 --> 01:44:50.620]  die badly and ran out of time it wasn't calendars that didn't make it to the
[01:44:50.620 --> 01:44:55.340]  floor to stop the naked body scanner but we should request that that come back
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:45:04.140]  next term and those are call email talk to your senator and to the governor
[01:45:04.140 --> 01:45:10.860]  and we should work with other states and I think you know we need to also try to
[01:45:10.860 --> 01:45:15.420]  get the airport early try to go through the metal detector and then refuse to be
[01:45:15.420 --> 01:45:20.900]  grope refuse to go through the naked body scanner protector dignity use other
[01:45:20.900 --> 01:45:25.220]  forms of travel and we need ultimately the security needs to be done by
[01:45:25.220 --> 01:45:30.180]  individuals and turn it back to the free market but the airline determined
[01:45:30.180 --> 01:45:34.140]  what's the best way to provide security some would do it one way some would do
[01:45:34.140 --> 01:45:39.980]  it another and eventually the best would turn up well representative in
[01:45:39.980 --> 01:45:48.300]  closing we know what common sense what course we should take and Benjamin
[01:45:48.300 --> 01:45:52.380]  Franklin said those that give up liberty for supposed security are going to get
[01:45:52.380 --> 01:45:57.580]  neither look we have hundreds of thousands of deaths and cars all these
[01:45:57.580 --> 01:46:01.900]  other you have a better chance of dying from the beasting and terrorism the idea
[01:46:01.900 --> 01:46:06.300]  that the federal government could ever protect us from terrorists is asinine to
[01:46:06.300 --> 01:46:09.980]  begin with and if they believe there's this big foreign terror threat the
[01:46:09.980 --> 01:46:14.780]  profiling you know that and it's not profiling of whole groups it's profiling
[01:46:14.780 --> 01:46:18.700]  of the type of individuals that statistically are involved in this and
[01:46:18.700 --> 01:46:24.260]  everybody knows it and I just really want to thank you for joining us and and
[01:46:24.260 --> 01:46:27.580]  Godspeed but you are confident it's probably going to pass the Senate if we
[01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:33.100]  put pressure on him I think so I have perceived very very little I mean I
[01:46:33.100 --> 01:46:38.980]  don't only think of three people that have opposed this bill as far as people
[01:46:38.980 --> 01:46:43.500]  around Texas there's been some that were hesitant to sign on to it until they
[01:46:43.500 --> 01:46:48.740]  saw how it was going but I'm expecting overwhelming place for the bill to pass
[01:46:48.740 --> 01:46:54.140]  out of the house today and I do expect support in the Senate and hopefully the
[01:46:54.140 --> 01:47:01.860]  signature of the governor so I thank you for this interview I believe in a free
[01:47:01.860 --> 01:47:06.820]  press and this is critical to solving problems in a peaceful way absolutely
[01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:10.500]  please take this message your colleagues in in final closing
[01:47:10.500 --> 01:47:15.900]  representative I want to thank you because I haven't been able to travel with
[01:47:15.900 --> 01:47:20.100]  my wife or three children for several years now because of the grope downs and
[01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:24.900]  now the scanners and and we want to be able to travel the places like Disney
[01:47:24.900 --> 01:47:29.020]  World we want to be able to travel and show my children the nation's capital
[01:47:29.020 --> 01:47:34.620]  but I will not have potbellied men and women sticking their hands down my
[01:47:34.620 --> 01:47:40.860]  children's pants and so please please please we pray that everybody support
[01:47:40.860 --> 01:47:45.140]  you and folks in other states to get our right to travel and dignity back
[01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:49.980]  representative David Simpson thank you so much for joining us today thank you
[01:47:49.980 --> 01:47:54.660]  Alex appreciate you have me thank you sir there you have it you heard him
[01:47:54.660 --> 01:48:03.020]  almost total support bipartisan no one almost no one I've seen the polls were
[01:48:03.020 --> 01:48:06.540]  over 90 plus percent are against the scanners and the grope downs you've
[01:48:06.540 --> 01:48:14.060]  seen the polls but when you watch the national news you see no one who's
[01:48:14.060 --> 01:48:18.580]  against it they will cut to an old lady an old man a young woman a black guy a
[01:48:18.580 --> 01:48:23.220]  white guy and they'll say I think it's good keeping me safe I think it's great
[01:48:23.220 --> 01:48:27.300]  and then it turned out CNN did that and it was a bunch of government bureaucrats
[01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:33.460]  they interviewed not telling people that not only were they bureaucrats they were
[01:48:33.460 --> 01:48:39.820]  prominent well-known Obama officials and Bush officials mid-level minions but
[01:48:39.820 --> 01:48:46.380]  high-level I mean it's just it's mind-blowing and I've told the story
[01:48:46.380 --> 01:48:54.420]  that I'm going back to your calls that I have a friend I don't want to say too
[01:48:54.420 --> 01:48:58.900]  much you can even trouble I have a friend who is pretty high level at the
[01:48:58.900 --> 01:49:03.460]  Austin Berksham airport I have several actually but but this particular
[01:49:03.460 --> 01:49:09.220]  individual one day his brother at least at the time was one of the managers at
[01:49:09.220 --> 01:49:12.740]  Axis TV I don't want to go too far and then and then give him up because they'll
[01:49:12.740 --> 01:49:16.980]  figure it out and I and this is this is five years ago and they started to
[01:49:16.980 --> 01:49:20.380]  taking the shoes off and the questioning then and he came in and I was
[01:49:20.380 --> 01:49:24.220]  getting my equipment checked out to go do my show and he said wait wait turn on
[01:49:24.220 --> 01:49:30.860]  News 8 Austin and we said okay so they flipped a News 8 Austin and he said yeah
[01:49:30.860 --> 01:49:34.580]  they were there for like two hours they'd interview over 40 people to find
[01:49:34.580 --> 01:49:40.620]  one person who said I love the new taking my shoes off taking my belt off I
[01:49:40.620 --> 01:49:44.600]  think it's great keeps me safe and he said as part of his job he had to sit
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:48.860]  there while this was going on and they went through more than 40 people and

[01:54:12.700 --> 01:54:34.060]  the point I was trying to get at is we got a call these people's block okay I
[01:54:34.060 --> 01:54:40.500]  mean 99.9% of people were against the banker bailout and scientific polls
[01:54:40.500 --> 01:54:47.860]  Barbara Boxer admitted she was getting 2000 to one phone calls against it but
[01:54:47.860 --> 01:54:50.740]  then the banks came in and said we'll have martial law if you don't do this
[01:54:50.740 --> 01:54:57.420]  they had O'Neill the former Treasury Secretary before snow and of course it
[01:54:57.420 --> 01:55:05.780]  was Paulson on Bloomberg say we may need to round up these members of Congress
[01:55:05.780 --> 01:55:10.900]  that are doing this they're the equivalent of Al Qaeda if you don't
[01:55:10.900 --> 01:55:17.020]  believe me just search former Treasury Secretary those against raising debt
[01:55:17.020 --> 01:55:20.460]  ceiling like Al Qaeda you can watch the Bloomberg video I've played it two or

[01:55:23.660 --> 01:55:26.020]  believe it's hard to believe they're sticking their hands down our pants
[01:55:26.020 --> 01:55:32.500]  they're out of control we've put up with so much now it's becoming ridiculous
[01:55:32.500 --> 01:55:39.660]  it's becoming a cartoon it's got to stop it's got to stop I mean the Supreme
[01:55:39.660 --> 01:55:44.700]  Court of Indiana has ruled there is no Fourth Amendment I mean I just read the
[01:55:44.700 --> 01:55:49.540]  article last hour you can't make it up the head judge in the deciding opinion
[01:55:49.540 --> 01:55:53.100]  Stephen David writing for the court said quote of a police officer wants to
[01:55:53.100 --> 01:55:58.420]  enter home for any reason or no reason at all just we'll do whatever we want a
[01:55:58.420 --> 01:56:02.620]  homeowner can I do anything to block the office's entry let me ask cops a
[01:56:02.620 --> 01:56:07.060]  question and these corrupt prosecutors do you really want to open this door this
[01:56:07.060 --> 01:56:11.380]  Pandora's box you know every culture that's done this goes directly to hell
[01:56:11.380 --> 01:56:18.300]  in a handbasket you think the foreign banks are robbing us now you get rid of
[01:56:18.300 --> 01:56:24.580]  whatever checks and balances there are who I mean none of us are safe hey cops

[02:00:13.980 --> 02:00:22.260]  Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[02:00:22.260 --> 02:00:29.980]  listen I'm on record that they're going to I even talked about earlier that
[02:00:29.980 --> 02:00:32.820]  we've got to dig up the clips but I want to put an article out later today in a
[02:00:32.820 --> 02:00:37.580]  video on it I'm on record saying that they would you know in the thousands of
[02:00:37.580 --> 02:00:41.380]  different documents under saying a million documents use that to put out new
[02:00:41.380 --> 02:00:45.460]  fake disinfo and to bolster their fake 9-11 story now they're saying there's a
[02:00:45.460 --> 02:00:51.060]  million documents a way to discredit quote bin Laden and then hence any of
[02:00:51.060 --> 02:00:54.620]  the Islamic jihadis that the globalists don't control they've now said they
[02:00:54.620 --> 02:00:59.340]  found porn in his lair this from a government caught putting out fake
[02:00:59.340 --> 02:01:05.860]  WMD documents fake Gulf of Tonkin it's just incredible I mean this is just
[02:01:05.860 --> 02:01:09.180]  going to get more and more insane because hey it doesn't matter if the
[02:01:09.180 --> 02:01:13.380]  bankers are robbing us we can have the 10 minutes of hate right out of George
[02:01:13.380 --> 02:01:17.060]  Arwell you know hating on Emmanuel Goldstein aka
[02:01:17.060 --> 02:01:23.660]  Osama bin Laden Michael in Florida then Lance medley got to get the medley Tom
[02:01:23.660 --> 02:01:28.500]  and others so go ahead Michael Michelle I can't even read that across the room
[02:01:28.500 --> 02:01:32.780]  sorry Michelle that's okay I've been watching you for about a month now and
[02:01:32.780 --> 02:01:38.260]  I've been trying to tell my husband and my family about what's going on and
[02:01:38.260 --> 02:01:41.700]  Steve Pachennick and I hate to bring it up after the other colors did but my
[02:01:41.700 --> 02:01:47.020]  husband is saying you know if he's really for real why won't he do something
[02:01:47.020 --> 02:01:50.740]  about it but I know you touched on that and also I mean why won't he do
[02:01:50.740 --> 02:01:55.260]  something about it he's on my radio show people always think that if you have
[02:01:55.260 --> 02:01:59.660]  been in a high-profile position you have magical powers I mean I mean I've got
[02:01:59.660 --> 02:02:03.460]  to brush my teeth every morning and it doesn't magically happen on its own I
[02:02:03.460 --> 02:02:07.100]  mean what is Pachennick supposed to do and yeah Pachennick isn't probably
[02:02:07.100 --> 02:02:11.700]  perfect all the things he's been involved in so now he can't come out and
[02:02:11.700 --> 02:02:16.900]  tell us info I mean I see what I'm saying too but I guess I guess the with these
[02:02:16.900 --> 02:02:20.340]  femalus and I looked it up that they added three million more people in
[02:02:20.340 --> 02:02:26.740]  September of 2010 so I mean if we if we have an uprising and everybody's out in
[02:02:26.740 --> 02:02:32.020]  the streets saying what the government's doing they can't get us all just like
[02:02:32.020 --> 02:02:34.940]  people say no to the body scanners they're gonna get removed and they'll
[02:02:34.940 --> 02:02:38.820]  tell us there's no way we're never gonna remove them because once they start to
[02:02:38.820 --> 02:02:43.420]  lose then people will know they're not invincible it's like a bully punches you
[02:02:43.420 --> 02:02:46.140]  and you go ahead and punch them and you see their nose break and blood spew out
[02:02:46.140 --> 02:02:50.580]  a lot of times the bully cries and runs off or at least they start figuring out
[02:02:50.580 --> 02:02:54.460]  hey you know this isn't a one-way street here we're not just gonna sit here and
[02:02:54.460 --> 02:02:57.820]  take it if the globalists want to get physical start trying to arrest people
[02:02:57.820 --> 02:03:01.260]  it'll be the quickest way for them to go down I don't want that to happen
[02:03:01.260 --> 02:03:06.500]  because it's gonna be very bloody very destructive and can go badly for
[02:03:06.500 --> 02:03:12.780]  everybody plus I'm on the top of the list and I don't I mean but you know what
[02:03:12.780 --> 02:03:15.980]  if it goes that road people just need to understand that the new old order is
[02:03:15.980 --> 02:03:21.700]  gonna fall and our neighbors around here they come to get our guns they're
[02:03:21.700 --> 02:03:24.940]  not taking me off to a FEMA camp remember though they won't say they're
[02:03:24.940 --> 02:03:28.140]  coming to get your guns they'll say they're arresting half the folks on the
[02:03:28.140 --> 02:03:31.980]  block for child porn or they're arresting people on the block for
[02:03:31.980 --> 02:03:37.460]  questioning or they'll say that there's an outbreak of a disease and then
[02:03:37.460 --> 02:03:41.060]  that's why they're picking you up so so remember they're gonna come claiming
[02:03:41.060 --> 02:03:45.780]  something else these are deceivers and they're not gonna call it martial law
[02:03:45.780 --> 02:03:49.420]  they're gonna call it security and freedom and they'll have a few thousand
[02:03:49.420 --> 02:03:53.260]  deaths from something and then say oh we're gonna be arresting those that have
[02:03:53.260 --> 02:03:57.380]  refused to be inoculated and then that's basically how it'll work and then
[02:03:57.380 --> 02:04:01.500]  they'll stage some shootouts and burning down houses that people are in to
[02:04:01.500 --> 02:04:05.020]  scare everybody and then you know they'll have videos somebody on fire
[02:04:05.020 --> 02:04:08.540]  running out of their house and then put it on the news and say you turn
[02:04:08.540 --> 02:04:12.220]  yourselves in or this is what's gonna happen and it's all an illusion remember
[02:04:12.220 --> 02:04:15.580]  that it's all psych warfare they can't stop us they have no power they're a
[02:04:15.580 --> 02:04:20.940]  joke the military is waking up look the biggest political contributions were
[02:04:20.940 --> 02:04:24.420]  from the military to Ron Paul last election what is that that's got a
[02:04:24.420 --> 02:04:29.180]  scare of the globalist and we get their internal documents Judy and the number
[02:04:29.180 --> 02:04:33.380]  one thing the global estate these criminals is the veterans and current
[02:04:33.380 --> 02:04:38.260]  military they're trained on average they join for the right reasons they have a
[02:04:38.260 --> 02:04:42.140]  twisted them into these demon creatures like many of the police have been so
[02:04:42.140 --> 02:04:45.980]  they are scared to death of the military because the military is ours
[02:04:45.980 --> 02:04:49.500]  military belongs to the republic the military's already made the right
[02:04:49.500 --> 02:04:53.940]  decision okay so I want to fix things peacefully the globalist wanted to get
[02:04:53.940 --> 02:04:59.100]  hot they're gonna stomp me flattered a pancake first but that's what that's what
[02:04:59.100 --> 02:05:03.860]  waters the tree this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[02:05:03.860 --> 02:05:08.100]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:05:08.100 --> 02:05:12.260]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[02:05:12.260 --> 02:05:16.180]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[02:05:16.180 --> 02:05:19.820]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:05:19.820 --> 02:05:24.220]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[02:05:24.220 --> 02:05:28.380]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:05:28.380 --> 02:05:32.180]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[02:05:32.180 --> 02:05:35.780]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[02:05:35.780 --> 02:05:40.140]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[02:08:47.940 --> 02:08:51.980]  that's my view of it as I've read some excerpts of it and he just couldn't
[02:08:51.980 --> 02:08:55.540]  believe that Boogliosi was saying there's no evidence no evidence absolutely
[02:08:55.540 --> 02:08:59.540]  none that there was anybody behind the grass you know no one said that no one
[02:08:59.540 --> 02:09:04.500]  no one just amazing so he's gonna be popping in to camera a little bit of
[02:09:04.500 --> 02:09:09.420]  that and bring some balance here but I'm glad to have Bob Chapman with us of
[02:09:09.420 --> 02:09:17.660]  the international forecaster.com silver of course was $5 an ounce or less 10
[02:09:17.660 --> 02:09:27.980]  years ago gold 11 years ago was $260 an ounce it went above 1550 and it dropped
[02:09:27.980 --> 02:09:32.380]  down quite a bit silver dropped down quite a bit and then we saw it inch up
[02:09:32.380 --> 02:09:36.220]  a little bit this week and then get driven back down and it's on record that
[02:09:36.220 --> 02:09:42.740]  they raised the margin calls to make it harder for the paper market to flourish
[02:09:42.740 --> 02:09:46.220]  it while at the same time a lot of the elitist companies and Bob can give you
[02:09:46.220 --> 02:09:50.380]  all the technicals on this dumped dumped billions and millions of dollars of
[02:09:50.380 --> 02:09:55.620]  paper silver into the market and they had to do that because the shorts were
[02:09:55.620 --> 02:09:59.780]  coming up and they were in deep trouble and couldn't cover them so you've seen
[02:09:59.780 --> 02:10:04.420]  a massive manipulation but if you look at the 11 year graph we put an 11 year
[02:10:04.420 --> 02:10:09.300]  silver graph and an 11 year gold graph up you'll notice that every year or two
[02:10:09.300 --> 02:10:12.860]  they drive it down quite a bit and then later it just races up even more but
[02:10:12.860 --> 02:10:18.940]  overall the graph is up up up unabated and clearly that's what's happening here
[02:10:18.940 --> 02:10:22.660]  because you have global concerted devaluation of all major currencies
[02:10:22.660 --> 02:10:27.860]  and gold and oil and other commodities are denominated in that and so the laws
[02:10:27.860 --> 02:10:33.580]  of finance and economics show they will go up the question is when and there is
[02:10:33.580 --> 02:10:39.580]  the 10 year gold so you see it almost up to 1600 a few weeks ago you see it
[02:10:39.580 --> 02:10:44.060]  dropping down what the media calls you know a plunge in the market now a plunge
[02:10:44.060 --> 02:10:48.540]  would be down to say 800 but no it you know plunge I don't know it looks like
[02:10:48.540 --> 02:10:54.580]  50 60 bucks there not a true plunge and silver the same type of movement on the
[02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:59.380]  graph silver moved up even faster than gold so it plunged more than gold but
[02:10:59.380 --> 02:11:02.780]  we'll put that graph back up but anybody out there who isn't watching on
[02:11:02.780 --> 02:11:08.460]  prisonplanet.tv you can simply go to a search engine put in 10 year gold graph
[02:11:08.460 --> 02:11:17.580]  10 year silver graph and look in 08 see that big plunge in 08 early 08 but then
[02:11:17.580 --> 02:11:22.940]  a few months later it starts its upward trend see that big plunge in May of 06
[02:11:22.940 --> 02:11:30.420]  it's almost always in May notice that plunge in May drop the May before that
[02:11:30.420 --> 02:11:34.100]  drop the May before that drop the May before that and then look we go to this
[02:11:34.100 --> 02:11:42.060]  May dropped again so you can see that trend the beginning of the summer is
[02:11:42.060 --> 02:11:45.900]  always a slow time but breaking that down and other economic numbers that are
[02:11:45.900 --> 02:11:51.420]  coming in the housing down the consumer confidence down unemployment up food
[02:11:51.420 --> 02:11:55.780]  stamps down going over 45 million and we've got the government-run media
[02:11:55.780 --> 02:12:01.340]  telling us the economy is wonderful and smoking hot right now and gas prices
[02:12:01.340 --> 02:12:05.420]  of course surging the international forecaster.com is Bob's great website
[02:12:05.420 --> 02:12:10.980]  Bob break down what's happening with gold and silver for us well what happened
[02:12:10.980 --> 02:12:16.380]  was that first of all there was no resistance of $50 on silver and most of
[02:12:16.380 --> 02:12:22.620]  the people who won silver in 1980 did the cease now and I'm sure those who did
[02:12:22.620 --> 02:12:27.260]  die their families had sold off during the ensuing years so there's no real
[02:12:27.260 --> 02:12:33.060]  overhang there so what they did was they raised the margin requirements on the
[02:12:33.060 --> 02:12:39.900]  comics five out of nine days they've never done that before and the amount of
[02:12:39.900 --> 02:12:43.620]  money that you have to put up this collateral on each contract was raised
[02:12:43.620 --> 02:12:52.700]  from $9,500 to $21,600 so this is open manipulation open manipulation so
[02:12:52.700 --> 02:12:59.620]  then the next step that wasn't bad enough simultaneously like some miracle
[02:12:59.620 --> 02:13:07.820]  all of the big brokerage houses that do commodities they all doubled the margin
[02:13:07.820 --> 02:13:13.620]  from there to $42,000 and all the little guys in the middle-sized guys in the
[02:13:13.620 --> 02:13:21.940]  market ladies to they get blown out and so that means two things it made the
[02:13:21.940 --> 02:13:29.140]  spike go down more radically from say 45 down to 32 and a half in today 33
[02:13:29.140 --> 02:13:35.700]  close but more importantly there's no overhang in the market because
[02:13:35.700 --> 02:13:40.340]  everybody was wiped out if they're doing anything they might be rebuying at the
[02:13:40.340 --> 02:13:45.460]  levels that silver is at today and I I point out silver because that's where
[02:13:45.460 --> 02:13:49.700]  all the action was that's what they wanted to kill by driving a stake through
[02:13:49.700 --> 02:13:55.460]  silver's heart so to speak and by the way I've sold nothing I've sold no gold no
[02:13:55.460 --> 02:14:03.020]  silver most the stuff I bought was you know 300 400 500 600 700 in golds five
[02:14:03.020 --> 02:14:06.980]  six seven eight nine ten dollars in silver and if silver went down to five
[02:14:06.980 --> 02:14:10.940]  dollars an ounce which of course it won't I wouldn't dump it because I know
[02:14:10.940 --> 02:14:16.100]  the laws of finance with dollar devaluation it's all manipulation am I
[02:14:16.100 --> 02:14:21.380]  wrong in that in my gut I know it's only going to go up over time you're
[02:14:21.380 --> 02:14:29.460]  absolutely correct in fact I was a buyer at 26 46 29 and early next week I'm
[02:14:29.460 --> 02:14:33.740]  gonna be a buyer again and I just keep on buying because I don't care what the
[02:14:33.740 --> 02:14:38.940]  price is I see silver up at three or four hundred dollars and I see gold at
[02:14:38.940 --> 02:14:42.700]  seventy nine hundred eight thousand dollars and I think it's gonna go there
[02:14:42.700 --> 02:14:47.300]  and I've been doing this for over 50 years so I think I got a pretty good
[02:14:47.300 --> 02:14:51.620]  handle and I remember you a two years ago saying it would go to 1500 and
[02:14:51.620 --> 02:14:55.340]  people couldn't believe it I remember you saying silver would go to 50 and
[02:14:55.340 --> 02:14:59.140]  people couldn't believe it and it went right up to it but but it's this
[02:14:59.140 --> 02:15:03.260]  psychological trick they play where if you look at the 11-year graph it's
[02:15:03.260 --> 02:15:08.060]  going up up up you see those dips almost always in fact always in May what is I
[02:15:08.060 --> 02:15:12.300]  mean not just this new manipulation and all the paper being dumped but but but
[02:15:12.300 --> 02:15:18.860]  why does it always dip in May I think because it's the end of the selling
[02:15:18.860 --> 02:15:24.660]  season the big selling seasons of the future of that year would be Christmas
[02:15:24.660 --> 02:15:29.580]  and the two Indian holidays Diwali and the other one I can forget what it is
[02:15:29.580 --> 02:15:35.900]  but this big big buying of gold and silver and that usually starts in late
[02:15:35.900 --> 02:15:41.940]  August and that's when the deal is put there or manufacturers put their orders
[02:15:41.940 --> 02:15:47.060]  in for gold and silver and other metals as well so that they will have it on hand
[02:15:47.060 --> 02:15:50.740]  and then I have to guess how many of this that any other thing that they're
[02:15:50.740 --> 02:15:55.860]  manufacturing they need during the month of September so you have a hiatus in
[02:15:55.860 --> 02:16:02.180]  manufacturing demand in holidays during the period from May through the end of
[02:16:02.180 --> 02:16:09.820]  August so historically there has been most of the time a slowdown during that
[02:16:09.820 --> 02:16:13.260]  year so it's like beach towns that are dead in the winter but you can't get a
[02:16:13.260 --> 02:16:19.220]  room in the summer with gold generally in fact always I've looked at 50 year
[02:16:19.220 --> 02:16:25.060]  graphs early summer it's horrible warms up in late August early September races
[02:16:25.060 --> 02:16:30.420]  up and so if you look at it year to year it builds up and crashed in the
[02:16:30.420 --> 02:16:37.900]  spring early summer or end of spring starts going down and then races back
[02:16:37.900 --> 02:16:42.260]  up in the fall but overall we're only going up in the mountain range the
[02:16:42.260 --> 02:16:47.340]  media tries to focus on the seasonal dips and the manipulation dips but in
[02:16:47.340 --> 02:16:51.380]  the aggregate it's only moving up and that's right and that's why you have to
[02:16:51.380 --> 02:16:57.580]  be a long-term investor and don't try to trade it since the last 11 years nine
[02:16:57.580 --> 02:17:04.540]  major currencies versus the dollar which is included so you've got nine
[02:17:04.540 --> 02:17:11.860]  currencies including the dollar against gold and silver for 11 years every year
[02:17:11.860 --> 02:17:24.260]  gold and silver have gone up over 20% on average versus those currencies now I'm
[02:17:24.260 --> 02:17:27.320]  a layman looking at this every morning and every evening but but reading
[02:17:27.320 --> 02:17:31.460]  Kikko the other big sides clearly correct me if I'm wrong they're still in
[02:17:31.460 --> 02:17:35.180]  there manipulating trying to drive it down further right now and every time
[02:17:35.180 --> 02:17:39.140]  it starts rallying you see them come in manipulated downward why are they so I
[02:17:39.140 --> 02:17:44.860]  mean a is that happening and B why are they so scared of metals well gold in
[02:17:44.860 --> 02:17:49.940]  particular silver because of the shirt position and gold is a monetary metal and
[02:17:49.940 --> 02:17:54.780]  there was a fight over the last two and a half years between the dollar and gold
[02:17:54.780 --> 02:18:00.180]  and very few people realize it and gold won hands down as the only real money in
[02:18:00.180 --> 02:18:04.660]  the world and that's why so many nations are buying gold right now you get
[02:18:04.660 --> 02:18:13.940]  China India Russia Brazil Iran Thailand and Mexico just almost bought almost a
[02:18:13.940 --> 02:18:18.420]  hundred tons here in the last massive they say they're gonna buy more University
[02:18:18.420 --> 02:18:23.620]  of Texas bought 500 million than another billion last month institutions the
[02:18:23.620 --> 02:18:29.340]  Chinese are gobbling it up so it tells you that that gold's in a monetary and
[02:18:29.340 --> 02:18:33.340]  by the way what does this mean though I'm sorry what does it mean that even
[02:18:33.340 --> 02:18:37.180]  during the dip you saw institutions using that as an excuse to buy it that
[02:18:37.180 --> 02:18:41.900]  means their actuary show it's going up as well I think you're right about that
[02:18:41.900 --> 02:18:47.180]  it's hard to find out exactly what each one is doing but there's no question
[02:18:47.180 --> 02:18:52.580]  there's major buyers in there I mean there's a big big guys and and they can
[02:18:52.580 --> 02:18:56.020]  take gold and silver up anytime they want they just got to pick their spots
[02:18:56.020 --> 02:19:02.580]  and so this is going to be an ongoing thing now and I think what's happened
[02:19:02.580 --> 02:19:07.660]  and you know this Forbes article here this week saying that what a bit within
[02:19:07.660 --> 02:19:13.260]  five years a C Forbes said well we'll be back on a gold standard and he's an
[02:19:13.260 --> 02:19:17.660]  insider so he probably got a good insight and so if he's right and I'm right
[02:19:17.660 --> 02:19:22.780]  then what's going to happen is that all these governments to get rid of their
[02:19:22.780 --> 02:19:27.900]  gold by leasing or selling during the last 20 years are going to start
[02:19:27.900 --> 02:19:30.900]  accumulating again because they're going to have to put it behind their
[02:19:30.900 --> 02:19:34.860]  currency if in fact that's what's going to happen and that is what's going to
[02:19:34.860 --> 02:19:38.460]  happen let's break that down on the other side look at other areas in the
[02:19:38.460 --> 02:19:43.020]  economy with Bob Chapman then with Bob Chapman riding shotgun we're going to be
[02:19:43.020 --> 02:19:48.900]  joined by Jim Mars one of the preeminent researchers on facts that prove the JFK
[02:19:48.900 --> 02:19:55.500]  operation was a inside government hit of John F. Kennedy and why are we talking
[02:19:55.500 --> 02:19:59.340]  about it almost 50 years later because the system is trying to rewrite history
[02:19:59.340 --> 02:20:03.940]  right now stay with us hi this is Alex Jones did you know that the global
[02:20:03.940 --> 02:20:07.500]  elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the
[02:20:07.500 --> 02:20:11.260]  Arctic Circle did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could
[02:20:11.260 --> 02:20:14.940]  become more valuable than silver or gold it's true seeds have all performed even
[02:20:14.940 --> 02:20:18.220]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[02:20:18.220 --> 02:20:22.300]  again so our friends and solutions from science have put together the perfect
[02:20:22.300 --> 02:20:27.700]  mix of non-hybrid seeds they call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an
[02:20:27.700 --> 02:20:31.940]  endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family and here's the best
[02:20:31.940 --> 02:20:35.700]  part these seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you

[02:21:11.820 --> 02:21:15.780]  soon hit the United States and could lead to millions of Americans becoming
[02:21:15.780 --> 02:21:19.740]  homeless all caused by the devalued US dollar while the mainstream media

[02:24:10.420 --> 02:24:14.940]  Steve so it'll just be a smorgasbord coming up the next two segments but I'm
[02:24:14.940 --> 02:24:19.900]  gonna get to you now because I want to hear what you have to say we appreciate
[02:24:19.900 --> 02:24:23.660]  your calls and then I feel guilty I don't get to them but there I've complained
[02:24:23.660 --> 02:24:30.020]  for you you don't have to complain but going back to Bob Chapman Bob the big
[02:24:30.020 --> 02:24:33.460]  central banks want to create a new Ponzi scheme a global currency a global
[02:24:33.460 --> 02:24:36.860]  government they're now admitting it they're now offering that as a solution
[02:24:36.860 --> 02:24:40.980]  to all the problems that they generated so for those that are new listeners it's
[02:24:40.980 --> 02:24:44.340]  now admitted the world government's real run by the banking cartel just like
[02:24:44.340 --> 02:24:49.220]  the old-timers told you 50 years ago was the plan so so that's a foregone
[02:24:49.220 --> 02:24:52.340]  conclusion the question is what will it be backed in well when you read the IMF
[02:24:52.340 --> 02:24:58.460]  and World Bank plans the UN statements Steve Forbes in Forbes they're all
[02:24:58.460 --> 02:25:01.980]  saying that it's gonna be gold backed or at least partially gold back and
[02:25:01.980 --> 02:25:06.300]  obviously that's because the globalists have been hoarding gold now some then
[02:25:06.300 --> 02:25:11.220]  argue against a gold back currency because they've done that regardless of
[02:25:11.220 --> 02:25:14.900]  what your view is of what the currency should be based in that's where things
[02:25:14.900 --> 02:25:23.220]  are moving so Bob Chapman break it down for us well I think that in order to
[02:25:23.220 --> 02:25:29.060]  make any currency work particularly at this time because of the opposition to
[02:25:29.060 --> 02:25:33.900]  a non-back currency by the BRIC countries and for those of you don't know
[02:25:33.900 --> 02:25:41.420]  there's Russia and China and India and Iran and Brazil and they certainly do
[02:25:41.420 --> 02:25:47.780]  not want to do a world currency this has no backing because they just saw what
[02:25:47.780 --> 02:25:55.380]  happened since August of 1971 to the US dollar so I don't see how they can have
[02:25:55.380 --> 02:26:00.580]  a currency and make people accept it without having gold and if they've got
[02:26:00.580 --> 02:26:05.300]  piles of gold who cares you worry about the currency that you're going to be
[02:26:05.300 --> 02:26:11.820]  using what you've got in hand also you know people say well suppose we get to
[02:26:11.820 --> 02:26:17.540]  the end of the trail here in golds 8,000 and silver is 500 and and then all
[02:26:17.540 --> 02:26:21.140]  we're going to do is change it for dollars well it may be different dollars
[02:26:21.140 --> 02:26:28.420]  and there's no rule that says that you have to exchange your money exchange
[02:26:28.420 --> 02:26:34.980]  of gold and silver for dollars you may barter it or at the same time you may
[02:26:34.980 --> 02:26:39.660]  keep it and do nothing with it and so you know and another thing we don't know
[02:26:39.660 --> 02:26:44.340]  what's coming down the road really we're all trying to back into what we think
[02:26:44.340 --> 02:26:53.180]  they will do oh yeah I forgot to ask you and incidentally I just was gonna say
[02:26:53.180 --> 02:26:58.980]  that the SDR by the rules of the IMF cannot be gold back so it's not gonna
[02:26:58.980 --> 02:27:02.940]  be an SDR unless they have an unbacked currency and I don't think they'll do
[02:27:02.940 --> 02:27:09.100]  that now expanding on just the craziness and we don't know what they're gonna do
[02:27:09.100 --> 02:27:14.460]  next what do you think of the whole bin Laden situation the bin Laden killing
[02:27:15.380 --> 02:27:21.780]  well I don't think he was killing his dead long you know in December of 01 come
[02:27:21.780 --> 02:27:26.900]  on Bob the government would have been a sabbou to her of course not I know that
[02:27:26.900 --> 02:27:31.940]  Alex but I you know I have an opinion even though the government might be
[02:27:31.940 --> 02:27:37.820]  mistaken but anyway the Buddha come out and said look this man's dead and they
[02:27:37.820 --> 02:27:42.740]  whacked her three months later so it must have been really really important
[02:27:42.740 --> 02:27:50.660]  because she was an agent of the CIA and MI6 that's on record but but wait I mean
[02:27:50.660 --> 02:27:56.180]  our own media told us Benazir Buddha hit her head it was all over the news and
[02:27:56.180 --> 02:28:00.660]  video was released a machine gunner but our government is are such truthful
[02:28:00.660 --> 02:28:05.620]  people they told us she hit her head and so I say she hit her head and the bin
[02:28:05.620 --> 02:28:12.300]  Laden killing last week is real Bob well then I'm gonna have to arrange from some
[02:28:12.300 --> 02:28:19.420]  incarceration to you I need a electro shot therapy yes yes yes I like they'd
[02:28:19.420 --> 02:28:22.900]  used to do in the 30s which is Bob I mean the government's lied to us over and
[02:28:22.900 --> 02:28:28.300]  over again and been caught lying I mean I think it's insane that you don't trust
[02:28:28.300 --> 02:28:31.140]  them when people lie to you over and over again and have been caught
[02:28:31.140 --> 02:28:34.780]  committing every crime you can imagine that means they're good people and you
[02:28:34.780 --> 02:28:39.620]  believe the next thing they tell you you are a weirdo well you know that's
[02:28:39.620 --> 02:28:44.020]  probably true and I haven't told that for a long long time but it's about
[02:28:44.020 --> 02:28:50.340]  probably 40 to 50% of the population that is waking up to the fact that these
[02:28:50.340 --> 02:28:55.380]  things that government does there are not real no no no they're not waking up
[02:28:55.380 --> 02:29:01.020]  they're going insane like you have mm-hmm I think it's insane and that's all
[02:29:01.020 --> 02:29:06.100]  over the world listen I've got people writing to the SEC and the CFTC about
[02:29:06.100 --> 02:29:11.460]  the market rigging and the letters are coming from Russia and Italy and and all
[02:29:11.460 --> 02:29:16.100]  over the place and I wonder what the the the two regulatory agents are thinking
[02:29:16.100 --> 02:29:20.740]  hey these letters are coming from all over the world I mean they know what
[02:29:20.740 --> 02:29:27.340]  we're doing well no no this is a mass delusion Ben Bernanke cares about us the
[02:29:27.340 --> 02:29:32.460]  Federal Reserve are good people Henry Paulson getting 200 million of his own
[02:29:32.460 --> 02:29:37.500]  bailout money that he directed from the Treasury that's normal and bin Laden was
[02:29:37.500 --> 02:29:43.600]  killed a week and a half ago it's all true and Obama cares about us and and the
[02:29:43.600 --> 02:29:47.180]  Supreme Court of Indiana getting rid of the Fourth Amendment is good and if you
[02:29:47.180 --> 02:29:50.180]  don't if you like the Fourth Amendment you're an extremist and the TSA stick
[02:29:50.180 --> 02:29:54.140]  in their hands on your pants that's good we're on the March the Empire's on the

[02:36:26.860 --> 02:36:30.220]  back up the next few weeks for a full hour interview I'm glad you reached out
[02:36:30.220 --> 02:36:35.900]  to us I'm flattered you listen to the show with Boogliozzi but Boogliozzi I
[02:36:35.900 --> 02:36:42.940]  was waiting for him to tell me that that JFK you know was killed that day flying
[02:36:42.940 --> 02:36:48.900]  a magic carpet I mean he just he was using the appeal to authority explain
[02:36:48.900 --> 02:36:53.820]  to people what the one-trick pony Boogliozzi does well that's the whole
[02:36:53.820 --> 02:36:58.860]  deal and number one he obviously doesn't even understand the full ramifications
[02:36:58.860 --> 02:37:05.580]  and all the details of the case but yet he's an appeal to authority here's the
[02:37:05.580 --> 02:37:09.980]  guy prosecuted the Manson family so you know whatever he says it's got to be
[02:37:09.980 --> 02:37:14.420]  correct so he just tell you anything and people say well that's a big loss he
[02:37:14.420 --> 02:37:19.900]  said that but I might point out that his 1700 page book which I refer to as the
[02:37:19.900 --> 02:37:25.180]  doorstop is the most remainder book in publishing history in other words they
[02:37:25.180 --> 02:37:29.420]  sent back more than they ever sold number one nobody can pour through the
[02:37:29.420 --> 02:37:34.300]  thing what's your proof of that that's what I was told by sources in the
[02:37:34.300 --> 02:37:38.740]  publishing industry I mean they have numbers for all of this stuff but Alex
[02:37:38.740 --> 02:37:48.260]  it's it this is how silly it all is on on page 1142 Boogliozzi gives us a three
[02:37:48.260 --> 02:38:01.260]  page dialogue between a fictitious mafia figure he calls Veto and Jack Ruby and
[02:38:01.260 --> 02:38:08.100]  he says something like this would have had to take place and so he says Jack I
[02:38:08.100 --> 02:38:13.420]  got another job for you the boys watching a black Oswald you know
[02:38:13.420 --> 02:38:18.860]  silencing and he says well gee I don't know you I really have to do that you
[02:38:18.860 --> 02:38:26.940]  know how did the guy come up with a clever thinking like that Veto put in
[02:38:26.940 --> 02:38:32.620]  about it Jack anything for an old pal sounds like a bad
[02:38:32.620 --> 02:38:40.020]  script okay so so what you're saying is Boogliozzi had a lobotomized chimpanzee
[02:38:40.020 --> 02:38:46.140]  writing this yeah really and then over here on page 422 he says now okay now
[02:38:46.140 --> 02:38:54.740]  here is to comprehend how that the one bullet could go through two guys he said
[02:38:54.740 --> 02:39:02.260]  I finally came up with this simple method what I did was this page 422 extend
[02:39:02.260 --> 02:39:07.100]  the palm and forefingers of your left hand representing human body straight up
[02:39:07.100 --> 02:39:10.420]  perpendicular to the ground now and climb your hand backwards that is to your
[02:39:10.420 --> 02:39:15.260]  left illustrating the president leaning forward now take your right index finger
[02:39:15.260 --> 02:39:19.940]  keeping it straight point it straightly downward putting the tip against the palm
[02:39:19.940 --> 02:39:25.100]  of your open hand the tip represents the descending bullet or has that for some
[02:39:25.100 --> 02:39:31.780]  proof take your fingers and point them and move them around I mean this is this
[02:39:31.780 --> 02:39:37.660]  guy is too much and yet he comes out and quite confidently says yes well you know
[02:39:37.660 --> 02:39:43.180]  we saw the case it was Lee Harvey Oswald and let me stop you how about
[02:39:43.180 --> 02:39:46.980]  because I mean he has written a lot of best-selling books he is a smart guy he
[02:39:46.980 --> 02:39:51.780]  was very nice to me and he's a friendly fellow he wanted to indict Bush on war
[02:39:51.780 --> 02:39:55.860]  crime so I agree with him on some issues disagree on others I think he
[02:39:55.860 --> 02:40:00.340]  genuinely believes that Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone how about I try to get
[02:40:00.340 --> 02:40:06.340]  you guys on on a radio debate oh man I'm all for it but I'll bet you a dime
[02:40:06.340 --> 02:40:11.740]  against the dollar he turns you down because you know I've followed him
[02:40:11.740 --> 02:40:18.100]  before and he came out with his five absolute facts that prove Oswald did it
[02:40:18.100 --> 02:40:22.580]  and I've shot down all five of them okay so I'll bet you didn't do it but I'm
[02:40:22.580 --> 02:40:26.980]  willing I'll go for it but keep in mind we're dealing with somebody who is not
[02:40:26.980 --> 02:40:33.820]  really into rational debate see in the debate one side presents their facts and
[02:40:33.820 --> 02:40:37.460]  evidence and then their arguments and the other side presents their facts and
[02:40:37.460 --> 02:40:44.860]  their evidence and their argument Google OC his response to criticism is to
[02:40:44.860 --> 02:40:49.860]  call his opponents and I'm going to I'm this is a partial list of names in his
[02:40:49.860 --> 02:40:56.180]  book Zany Silly's moonshine silly buffs conspiracy theories cuckoo birds crack
[02:40:56.180 --> 02:41:03.620]  pot nuts and publicity secrets you know that that's it that's his rebuttal to
[02:41:03.620 --> 02:41:10.340]  contrary evidence and facts anyway you're right and it but here's what
[02:41:10.340 --> 02:41:16.180]  gives me he's is a smart person that's why I cannot believe in the depths of my
[02:41:16.180 --> 02:41:21.540]  soul that he truly believes what he's writing which means there must be some
[02:41:21.540 --> 02:41:25.900]  ulterior agenda and I'm not about to address that because I have no idea what
[02:41:25.900 --> 02:41:32.060]  that might be well I want to bring Bob Chapman in but then I want to address the
[02:41:32.060 --> 02:41:37.860]  heart of the matter he would just with these sweeping statements like everyone
[02:41:37.860 --> 02:41:44.620]  knows the moon is made of onion or everyone knows the moon is made out of
[02:41:44.620 --> 02:41:51.060]  bowling ball chips and when we all know it's made out of green cheese so what
[02:41:51.060 --> 02:41:55.820]  I'm saying exactly it is just off the wall he would say that's ridiculous no
[02:41:55.820 --> 02:42:00.300]  proof no one saw shooters on the knoll and I start listening and he's like no
[02:42:00.300 --> 02:42:07.700]  no no no they mean he on record how many witnesses saw the poof of smoke saw the
[02:42:07.700 --> 02:42:11.460]  green pickup saw the guys with the rifles they picked the tramps up I mean
[02:42:11.460 --> 02:42:21.900]  doesn't but here's the two critical ones okay Kenny O'Donnell and his one of his
[02:42:21.900 --> 02:42:29.700]  of Kennedy's personal aids okay and Dave Powers Dave Powers and Kenny O'Donnell
[02:42:29.700 --> 02:42:37.220]  two of Kennedy's personal aids and in Tip O'Neill's book he went and talked with
[02:42:37.220 --> 02:42:41.980]  them and they said we saw smoke coming off the grassy knoll and we both figured
[02:42:41.980 --> 02:42:46.740]  that there was somebody shooting from the grassy knoll but the FBI told us that
[02:42:46.740 --> 02:42:50.620]  they didn't want to confuse the case and they didn't want to cause any trouble so
[02:42:50.620 --> 02:42:56.340]  we went along with that and we didn't say anything about that there you go folks
[02:42:56.340 --> 02:43:01.980]  two of Kennedy's top eight shots came from the knoll but there are people that
[02:43:01.980 --> 02:43:06.700]  are in FBI reports where there are cases where it got in the reports oh absolutely
[02:43:06.700 --> 02:43:14.300]  Gene Hill who was right across the street in her January 64 FBI report
[02:43:14.300 --> 02:43:17.860]  claiming states that there was a shot from the grassy knoll she looked here's
[02:43:17.860 --> 02:43:22.740]  big Leosy no no one said it I said well wait people said it the guy at the train
[02:43:22.740 --> 02:43:31.860]  station no after the fact and I'm like he just he got killed right after no no
[02:43:31.860 --> 02:43:39.380]  proof no one no one no one you're like listing names listen listen listen I
[02:43:39.380 --> 02:43:45.220]  interviewed grody everything is after the fact listen I interviewed grody who
[02:43:45.220 --> 02:43:50.260]  ended up he's 90 something years old now I think the general home director I mean
[02:43:50.260 --> 02:43:54.060]  that guy owns you know the big chain of giant funeral homes around Texas at the
[02:43:54.060 --> 02:43:58.500]  time he owned this one and he came on my show first he'd always he'd given a few
[02:43:58.500 --> 02:44:02.460]  newspaper interviews but people like boot Leosy would similarly say that's not
[02:44:02.460 --> 02:44:06.820]  real they didn't talk to him well it turns out he came to a talkfest event I
[02:44:06.820 --> 02:44:11.780]  was at with his son and he told me there with all the background talking and
[02:44:11.780 --> 02:44:16.780]  stuff no that the FBI came I had Lee Harvey Oswald's body they put ink on it
[02:44:16.780 --> 02:44:20.060]  because they wanted that print to stick and they rubbed it on it and then they
[02:44:20.060 --> 02:44:23.860]  went and robbed it robbed it out of the crypt later and and then I said well come
[02:44:23.860 --> 02:44:28.780]  on the radio and do an interview and he came and did the interview but and then
[02:44:28.780 --> 02:44:31.460]  I was coming to another interview at his house and somebody ran him off the road
[02:44:31.460 --> 02:44:34.940]  and they said and he almost died and they said we might not want to do the
[02:44:34.940 --> 02:44:46.180]  interviews now yeah but yeah well listen Paul Rudy he was he was the director there at Miller funeral home in Fort Worth and and I was with just
[02:44:46.180 --> 02:44:50.580]  years after the fascination like three four years I was police reporter there and
[02:44:50.580 --> 02:44:55.140]  I got to know Rudy and we were good friends and he was a very honest down-to-earth
[02:44:55.140 --> 02:45:01.980]  guy as I'm sure you realized after talking with him for a while oh he's he's
[02:45:01.980 --> 02:45:06.100]  an old-timer so solid as a rock yeah no great Texan that's why I did so well in
[02:45:06.100 --> 02:45:10.980]  business with funeral homes all over the state yeah and there you are by the way
[02:45:10.980 --> 02:45:15.900]  he also told me that the Secret Service came to him about a week after they
[02:45:15.900 --> 02:45:21.540]  buried Oswald and they were asking him about scars on the body and marks and
[02:45:21.540 --> 02:45:26.940]  and physical things like that and then one of them remarked and said you know we
[02:45:26.940 --> 02:45:31.980]  really don't know who we have in that great isn't that something yeah he told
[02:45:31.980 --> 02:45:36.300]  me that as well and I remember people before I ran into him and then pulled it
[02:45:36.300 --> 02:45:39.460]  up and confirmed he was who he said he was and went out to his house and stuff
[02:45:39.460 --> 02:45:45.260]  I had read people going Mars makes that up in his book that the funeral home guy
[02:45:45.260 --> 02:45:51.460]  says it no one says it it's not true what about the railway switcher station
[02:45:51.460 --> 02:45:54.700]  guy that was like 60 yards away the switch station still there in the
[02:45:54.700 --> 02:46:01.100]  parking lot who saw him bigger than Dallas with the weapon right yeah yeah
[02:46:01.100 --> 02:46:06.260]  and in fact that's interesting because when he was testifying to the Warren
[02:46:06.260 --> 02:46:10.380]  Commission he got right to the point where he said and something caught my
[02:46:10.380 --> 02:46:18.900]  eye down there at the corner of the fence and and it was it was probably the
[02:46:18.900 --> 02:46:26.660]  senator from Pennsylvania the single bullet theory senator specter he was an
[02:46:26.660 --> 02:46:31.380]  aid of the time specter yeah and he just says well we're a lot of people coming
[02:46:31.380 --> 02:46:35.660]  in later on and he just directs him directly away from that from what he
[02:46:35.660 --> 02:46:38.340]  was fixing and they said well this aid is great he come up with the magic
[02:46:38.340 --> 02:46:41.740]  Easter Bunny bullet and everything else we're gonna have to make him a senator
[02:46:41.740 --> 02:46:44.900]  let's get Bob Chapman's take on this then take a few calls all over the map
[02:46:44.900 --> 02:46:50.060]  Bob Chapman I know that you're one of those insane people that that questions
[02:46:50.060 --> 02:46:54.100]  who killed Kennedy I think it's unreasonable well I think you're right
[02:46:54.100 --> 02:47:03.980]  and I have a personal interest not a professional one like Mr. Mars but I knew
[02:47:03.980 --> 02:47:09.580]  the Kennedy family when I was young I used to caddy for Joe Kennedy during the
[02:47:09.580 --> 02:47:14.700]  summer times that I still have his country club when I was a teenager so it
[02:47:14.700 --> 02:47:21.460]  interests me very much I lived in Los Angeles for 36 years and I knew people
[02:47:21.460 --> 02:47:27.380]  in the district attorney's office very very well because they were neighbors of
[02:47:27.380 --> 02:47:36.500]  Mayan and Malibu and so I knew the reputation of Mr. Bugliosi and he
[02:47:36.500 --> 02:47:41.820]  might have been very nice to you but he's not very well liked yeah I don't
[02:47:41.820 --> 02:47:48.340]  think he liked me calling him Vincent Diablo Bugliosi the other day
[02:47:48.340 --> 02:47:55.900]  yeah well he's arrogant for one thing and that bothers me well that's the
[02:47:55.900 --> 02:48:00.780]  know-it-all syndrome but you know there's there's all kinds of things that
[02:48:00.780 --> 02:48:06.460]  go on in DA's offices that never escape and because of my relationship with
[02:48:06.460 --> 02:48:10.540]  people who work there and some people who still work there just stop you're
[02:48:10.540 --> 02:48:14.700]  gonna get us in trouble again like the Ronnie thing and the I don't even want
[02:48:14.700 --> 02:48:19.660]  to go there it's Bob Chapman by the way stuff Bob says sounds nuts and you go
[02:48:19.660 --> 02:48:23.020]  look it up everything he says historically he was there he did it he
[02:48:23.020 --> 02:48:26.020]  did all these things so he tells us he was caddying for the head of the
[02:48:26.020 --> 02:48:31.220]  Kennedy family I believe it I gotta get you on Bob just some time for all the

[02:49:49.340 --> 02:49:56.180]  self-plug here too nothing I have written in general okay now there may
[02:49:56.180 --> 02:50:01.220]  been everybody makes mistakes there may be a detail here or there but nothing
[02:50:01.220 --> 02:50:05.140]  I've ever written has been proven to be wrong in other words I've only tried to
[02:50:05.140 --> 02:50:09.740]  tell the truth my entire life and what gets me is that I'm still the
[02:50:09.740 --> 02:50:13.820]  conspiracy theorist and yet the federal government which has been caught in lie
[02:50:13.820 --> 02:50:19.300]  after lie after lie and doubled on other lies that they still put something out
[02:50:19.300 --> 02:50:24.180]  and the corporate mass media just runs with it like it's gospel no they could
[02:50:24.180 --> 02:50:30.700]  can elephant poop and tell people that it was chocolate icing and ABC CBS Fox
[02:50:30.700 --> 02:50:34.700]  reporters would open the can and eat it and feed it to their kids that's right
[02:50:34.700 --> 02:50:39.940]  and I just don't quite understand that because I treat everybody the same if
[02:50:39.940 --> 02:50:43.580]  you lied to me once I can be pretty forgiving and think well maybe you made
[02:50:43.580 --> 02:50:47.860]  a mistake if you lied to me twice raises my eyebrows you lied to me three
[02:50:47.860 --> 02:50:52.220]  four times that's it I don't want to have anything to it absolutely of course
[02:50:52.220 --> 02:50:57.100]  the government when don't they lie when they tell the truth it's like finding a

[02:51:03.620 --> 02:51:08.780]  Alex Jones here with key information the US government is a Ponzi scheme that
[02:51:08.780 --> 02:51:12.100]  relies on the Treasury continuously selling large amounts of government
[02:51:12.100 --> 02:51:17.420]  bonds to foreign central banks with Japan about to become a seller of US bonds
[02:51:17.420 --> 02:51:22.380]  in order to rebuild its own nation and the US antagonizing China by calling
[02:51:22.380 --> 02:51:25.940]  them currency manipulators the Federal Reserve which is already buying about
[02:51:25.940 --> 02:51:30.620]  70% of US Treasuries will soon be the only buyer left of US Treasuries our
[02:51:30.620 --> 02:51:34.460]  friends at the National Inflation Association believe that the US dollar
[02:51:34.460 --> 02:51:38.100]  will soon become worthless and Americans will see the purchasing power of their

[02:54:56.180 --> 02:55:00.860]  comes well I do Smedley but we're being gang gang raped by a bunch of demonic

[02:55:05.500 --> 02:55:10.380]  want people to wake up and route these rats I'm sorry I just want to say you
[02:55:10.380 --> 02:55:14.460]  know my fiance she's a detective and I want to say it's really been a it's
[02:55:14.460 --> 02:55:18.100]  been a process waking up and I've just found that the best way to do it is
[02:55:18.100 --> 02:55:21.900]  incrementally and I would just like to add a couple of last comments and I'll
[02:55:21.900 --> 02:55:25.700]  try to be as quick as I go ahead we're almost out of time go ahead is just that
[02:55:25.700 --> 02:55:29.980]  I work in a public facility and there used to be a guy that always came in
[02:55:29.980 --> 02:55:35.140]  passing out flyers and information on things like chemtrails and poisons and
[02:55:35.140 --> 02:55:39.900]  I'll just say this guy is known as crazy Dan and how ironic is it that you know he
[02:55:39.900 --> 02:55:43.900]  talked about mind control on TV and all this stuff and and everyone just thought
[02:55:43.900 --> 02:55:48.380]  this guy's a lunatic and the house this guy I'm just saying how ironic it is that
[02:55:48.380 --> 02:55:52.740]  that everyone calls him crazy Dan and he's actually speaking more truth than
[02:55:52.740 --> 02:55:57.220]  anybody else and lastly I would just like to end is that your great guess
[02:55:57.220 --> 02:56:01.300]  that you have on I've learned so much from him and I would like to just request
[02:56:01.300 --> 02:56:05.340]  if you could ever have Naomi Wolf and I love listening to Joel Scousen and also
[02:56:05.340 --> 02:56:09.060]  the doctor that used to be a former veterinarian that speaks about
[02:56:09.060 --> 02:56:15.140]  nutrition thank you thank you Smedley yeah we we've tried to get Naomi Wolf on
[02:56:15.140 --> 02:56:19.140]  and the last few times her phone keeps cutting out every time she set up for
[02:56:19.140 --> 02:56:24.900]  the show and I don't know what's going on with that but that's a good way to end
[02:56:24.900 --> 02:56:29.460]  it with a final comment from Jim Mars and then one from Bob Chapman is this
[02:56:29.460 --> 02:56:34.140]  isn't working anymore just calling people crazy if we don't buy whatever
[02:56:34.140 --> 02:56:38.300]  government tells us and I think government has counted too long on being
[02:56:38.300 --> 02:56:43.380]  able to sell us that packaged elephant droppings and donkey droppings from the
[02:56:43.380 --> 02:56:48.540]  Democratic and Republican Party as apples I mean it's just if we smell what
[02:56:48.540 --> 02:56:51.820]  they're put in front of us we're conspiracy theorist for questioning and
[02:56:51.820 --> 02:56:56.940]  more Americans are going you know what I'm not gonna eat what you're feeding me
[02:56:56.940 --> 02:57:03.500]  anymore a comment on that Jim Mars yeah they going back to 1963 the year of the
[02:57:03.500 --> 02:57:07.980]  kidney assassination the government had all the credibility they could have ever
[02:57:07.980 --> 02:57:11.460]  hoped for if the government said something if Jack or Hoover said
[02:57:11.460 --> 02:57:16.300]  something then it was just gospel that was the way it was and they've lost it
[02:57:16.300 --> 02:57:20.700]  and why they lost it it is it because the public suddenly woke up and said
[02:57:20.700 --> 02:57:24.820]  well I just don't think I believe them anymore they've lost it because they've
[02:57:24.820 --> 02:57:29.360]  squandered it they've lied to us and lied to us and lied to us until even the
[02:57:29.360 --> 02:57:33.620]  dullest of us today go yeah I don't know if I really trust what the government
[02:57:33.620 --> 02:57:38.540]  saying and I think that's a terrible and egregious situation and we've got to
[02:57:38.540 --> 02:57:42.500]  turn that around we've got to put people into office that whether we agree with
[02:57:42.500 --> 02:57:47.380]  them or not we can at least trust them very well said they have lost almost all
[02:57:47.380 --> 02:57:50.740]  credibility and they're desperately trying to keep it right now final
[02:57:50.740 --> 02:57:58.220]  comments on that same front Bob use the awakening and turbo drive absolutely
[02:57:58.220 --> 02:58:01.980]  we're breathing down their necks and they don't know what to do they're having
[02:58:01.980 --> 02:58:06.580]  to expedite their programs look at the two pieces of garbage they just put out
[02:58:06.580 --> 02:58:12.020]  well about bin Laden and the live birth certificate a certificate of live birth
[02:58:12.020 --> 02:58:19.100]  absolutely ridiculous I mean you would have to be just dumb of the dumb to put
[02:58:19.100 --> 02:58:24.180]  that into general circulation in the media in America you could see right
[02:58:24.180 --> 02:58:27.380]  through it that's why they won't release the bin Laden photo because we proved so
[02:58:27.380 --> 02:58:30.980]  fast that the birth certificate was a fake I thought it was on purpose maybe
[02:58:30.980 --> 02:58:35.540]  they are that arrogant and now the White House has no more fake photos because
[02:58:35.540 --> 02:58:39.420]  they were fake before hey guys great job great job with the crew see you back
[02:58:39.420 --> 02:58:58.940]  Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. God bless you
