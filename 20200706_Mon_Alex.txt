[00:00.000 --> 00:16.800]  If tomorrow all the things were gone I'd work for all my life And I had to start again
[00:16.800 --> 00:27.120]  With just my children and my wife I'd thank my lucky stars To be living here today
[00:27.120 --> 00:33.120]  Because the flag still stands for freedom And they can't take that away
[00:33.120 --> 00:37.120]  This song is not prophetic
[00:37.120 --> 00:43.120]  And I'm proud to be an American Where at least I know how to be
[00:43.120 --> 00:49.120]  And I won't pretend to be the man who died Who gave that life to me
[00:49.120 --> 00:53.120]  And I gladly stand up
[00:53.120 --> 00:57.120]  But men are discovering themselves right now across the world
[00:57.120 --> 00:59.120]  An America
[00:59.120 --> 01:02.120]  Once again reclaim its destiny
[01:02.120 --> 01:04.120]  From a long march
[01:04.120 --> 01:06.120]  For humans great destiny
[01:06.120 --> 01:11.120]  We will face world government, a robot, drone takeover
[01:11.120 --> 01:16.120]  And science fiction nightmares that you probably can't even imagine but you will face it
[01:16.120 --> 01:17.120]  And you will come through it
[01:17.120 --> 01:19.120]  Most of you will die
[01:19.120 --> 01:23.120]  What matters is you'll die anyway someday
[01:23.120 --> 01:25.120]  At least you'll die on your feet
[01:25.120 --> 01:28.120]  Across the plains of Texas
[01:28.120 --> 01:32.120]  From the sea to shining sea
[01:32.120 --> 01:35.120]  From Detroit down to Houston
[01:35.120 --> 01:38.120]  And New York to LA
[01:38.120 --> 01:44.120]  I felt yesterday morning the enemies will break
[01:44.120 --> 01:48.120]  Massive, massive download
[01:48.120 --> 01:52.120]  And I'm proud to be an American
[01:52.120 --> 01:54.120]  Where at least I know how to be
[01:54.120 --> 01:58.120]  And I won't pretend to be the man who died
[01:58.120 --> 02:01.120]  And I gladly stand up
[02:01.120 --> 02:05.120]  And I won't pretend to be the man who died
[02:05.120 --> 02:09.120]  And I won't pretend to be the man who died
[02:09.120 --> 02:13.120]  And I won't pretend to be the man who died
[02:13.120 --> 02:19.120]  Right at the creator and just say, I'm yours, I'm weak, I need you
[02:22.120 --> 02:25.120]  We're going to protect our children, you know
[02:25.120 --> 02:30.120]  J.K. Rowling's is a big liberal, at least she was, but she's smart
[02:30.120 --> 02:34.120]  And now she looks at how they are chemically castrating children
[02:34.120 --> 02:36.120]  And doing medical experiments on them
[02:36.120 --> 02:39.120]  And now she's coming out against all of it
[02:39.120 --> 02:43.120]  More people when they see the real horror of the Satanism and the abuse of children
[02:43.120 --> 02:46.120]  Are going to decide which side you're on
[02:46.120 --> 02:51.120]  Are you with the children or are you with this devil
[02:51.120 --> 02:54.120]  That will be damned for eternity
[02:59.120 --> 03:01.120]  You turn the corner
[03:01.120 --> 03:03.120]  That's going to be rough
[03:03.120 --> 03:05.120]  And there's going to be other big fights to come
[03:05.120 --> 03:07.120]  But the enemies will has been broken
[03:07.120 --> 03:11.120]  I expect they're going to stage mass shooting and some bombings very quickly
[03:11.120 --> 03:13.120]  Probably release even more deadly bio weapons
[03:13.120 --> 03:15.120]  They just got us primed for that
[03:15.120 --> 03:17.120]  But their will's broken
[03:17.120 --> 03:20.120]  And they threw everything they had at us
[03:20.120 --> 03:23.120]  Guarantee they were sacrificing kids in torches from 24-7
[03:23.120 --> 03:26.120]  Just, I mean, it's been a hellish time
[03:26.120 --> 03:28.120]  With the dark energy they've been putting out
[03:28.120 --> 03:33.120]  But light just poured back into the planet
[03:33.120 --> 03:37.120]  And it was this attempt to make us reject America and hate ourselves
[03:37.120 --> 03:41.120]  And this guilt trip, these demons spew at us
[03:41.120 --> 03:43.120]  Because they know we have a conscience
[03:43.120 --> 03:46.120]  But it's a hack when they use a conscience against us
[03:46.120 --> 03:49.120]  Because it's not real, it's all synthetic
[03:49.120 --> 03:51.120]  We have our conscience, it's pointed at God
[03:51.120 --> 03:53.120]  We are receivers
[03:53.120 --> 03:55.120]  We are transmitters
[03:55.120 --> 03:57.120]  That's what we're built for
[03:57.120 --> 04:01.120]  Is to receive God's power and to project back consciousness
[04:01.120 --> 04:04.120]  Into the universe from every level
[04:06.120 --> 04:08.120]  Ugh, these globalists, I tell ya
[04:08.120 --> 04:11.120]  They do all this nasty stuff to just make you give up
[04:11.120 --> 04:15.120]  And you have to realize that you can't let them demoralize you
[04:15.120 --> 04:18.120]  You can't let them make you feel like you're a piece of crap, you're not
[04:18.120 --> 04:21.120]  You're made in the image of the creator
[04:21.120 --> 04:23.120]  And all the amazing design around us
[04:23.120 --> 04:26.120]  And that's why these scum, these poor people
[04:26.120 --> 04:32.120]  Zuckerberg and Jack, you know, Dorsey and Tim Cook
[04:32.120 --> 04:35.120]  And the Queen of England and just all of these people
[04:35.120 --> 04:38.120]  Are just God-forsaken losers
[04:38.120 --> 04:42.120]  Absolute, pathetic, disconnected people
[04:42.120 --> 04:47.120]  They are more poor than a mentally ill, homeless person
[04:47.120 --> 04:49.120]  Squatting in their own feces
[04:49.120 --> 04:53.120]  There is nothing lower or more pathetic or sad than them
[04:53.120 --> 04:54.120]  They're a joke
[04:54.120 --> 04:57.120]  And we all know it and they know we know it
[05:25.120 --> 05:27.120]  That's Back in Stock Ultra 12
[05:27.120 --> 05:30.120]  Super high quality V12, we can take it out of the tongue

[05:50.120 --> 05:51.120]  At FullWorksStore.com
[05:51.120 --> 05:53.120]  We could not have done this without you
[05:53.120 --> 05:57.120]  I thank you for your continued prayer, your focus, and your support
[05:57.120 --> 06:23.120]  Again, I salute you all
[06:27.120 --> 06:31.120]  I think a lot of you will be shocked at the thousands, thousands
[06:31.120 --> 06:34.120]  Of incredible songs that lift up the human spirit
[06:34.120 --> 06:35.120]  Let's listen to him for here
[06:35.120 --> 06:38.120]  Just a moment on the July 6th global transmission
[06:38.120 --> 06:47.120]  Some AI computer didn't create that
[06:47.120 --> 06:52.120]  Are those humans, are you like angels?
[06:52.120 --> 06:56.120]  Are those women?
[06:56.120 --> 06:58.120]  Do you think the enemy likes that?
[06:58.120 --> 07:01.120]  No, they don't like you seeing those high places
[07:01.120 --> 07:05.120]  But songs can take your spirit
[07:05.120 --> 07:09.120]  That's why we have to celebrate purity and goodness and God
[07:09.120 --> 07:11.120]  And children
[07:11.120 --> 07:14.120]  The enemy's religion is the inversion of all of that
[07:14.120 --> 07:17.120]  Imagine the reverse of this song
[07:17.120 --> 07:20.120]  That is the enemy
[07:20.120 --> 07:22.120]  They want to take from you
[07:22.120 --> 07:24.120]  Your spirit, your power
[07:24.120 --> 07:26.120]  Don't give it to them
[07:26.120 --> 07:28.120]  Revile them
[07:28.120 --> 07:29.120]  Revile Hollywood
[07:29.120 --> 07:31.120]  Revile Washington D.C.
[07:31.120 --> 07:33.120]  Revile the Satanist
[07:33.120 --> 07:43.120]  Break their will
[07:43.120 --> 07:47.120]  It's a steady strength God gives to feeling
[07:47.120 --> 07:48.120]  It's real
[07:48.120 --> 07:50.120]  If he doesn't take away from you
[07:50.120 --> 07:53.120]  It only makes you better and stronger
[07:53.120 --> 07:56.120]  You've got to love God
[07:56.120 --> 07:59.120]  And there's the ultimate freedom in that
[07:59.120 --> 08:02.120]  Better to reign in hell than serve on heaven
[08:02.120 --> 08:04.120]  Another lie, you don't reign in hell
[08:04.120 --> 08:08.120]  You burn in hell
[08:08.120 --> 08:12.120]  You burn because it's the absence of life
[08:12.120 --> 08:14.120]  The freeze
[08:14.120 --> 08:16.120]  In the coldest space
[08:16.120 --> 08:21.120]  He's like fire
[08:21.120 --> 08:25.120]  Freeze in hell
[08:25.120 --> 08:29.120]  Because to God, you're really on fire
[08:29.120 --> 08:31.120]  On fire forever
[08:31.120 --> 08:33.120]  Consciousness is expanding
[08:33.120 --> 08:37.120]  Creating, building, striving
[08:37.120 --> 08:42.120]  That's the great destiny
[08:42.120 --> 08:48.120]  The social engineers that have turned themselves over to pure wickedness
[08:48.120 --> 08:51.120]  And then really found out the door snapped shut
[08:51.120 --> 08:55.120]  And they were slaves, not empowered
[08:55.120 --> 08:59.120]  Are just that, they're slaves of evil
[08:59.120 --> 09:01.120]  But they're not who we should even focus on
[09:01.120 --> 09:07.120]  We should focus on rebuilding civilization and
[09:07.120 --> 09:12.120]  Reviling them like you revile a disease
[09:12.120 --> 09:16.120]  Or like you revile a car wreck where you see smashed dead children on the road
[09:16.120 --> 09:19.120]  It's a thing beyond hate, it's a revulsion
[09:19.120 --> 09:22.120]  They're revolting people
[09:22.120 --> 09:25.120]  Everything about the New World Order is revolting
[09:25.120 --> 09:28.120]  And they know they're revolting
[09:28.120 --> 09:34.120]  That's why they want to pull us down because they are
[09:34.120 --> 09:38.120]  Revolting
[09:38.120 --> 09:43.120]  Against God
[09:43.120 --> 09:53.120]  They love smothering you, they love the little gang of corrupt scientists, mad doctors
[09:53.120 --> 09:56.120]  Making us put masks on our faces
[09:56.120 --> 10:04.120]  Preparing us to take the inoculations, preparing us for the depopulation while they smirk and
[10:04.120 --> 10:06.120]  Laugh
[10:06.120 --> 10:09.120]  But really they're whistling past the graveyard
[10:09.120 --> 10:11.120]  They're scared
[10:11.120 --> 10:13.120]  Oh, they're very scared
[10:13.120 --> 10:15.120]  I've been around globalist
[10:15.120 --> 10:19.120]  The more high powered they are, the more you realize they're a hole
[10:19.120 --> 10:24.120]  A black hole into another dimension, there's nobody there
[10:24.120 --> 10:28.120]  They're like a camera on a wall looking at you, you know it's dead
[10:28.120 --> 10:31.120]  There might be a consciousness behind it looking through the hole
[10:31.120 --> 10:33.120]  But that's all they are is a keyhole
[10:33.120 --> 10:36.120]  A keyhole in the nightmares
[10:36.120 --> 10:41.120]  And they're trying to turn our heaven into hell
[10:41.120 --> 10:48.120]  And it's time to stop fearing them
[10:48.120 --> 10:54.120]  It's time to not put them in the position of our judges
[10:54.120 --> 10:57.120]  Our priests, our kings, our gods
[10:57.120 --> 11:03.120]  When all they're doing is trying to destroy civilization for their master
[11:03.120 --> 11:08.120]  Nothing but a kill switch program for not just humans but the entire planet
[11:08.120 --> 11:10.120]  That's why they're the guardians of the children
[11:10.120 --> 11:12.120]  Oh, they're the guardians of the earth
[11:12.120 --> 11:15.120]  Oh, they're the guardians of the arts, they're liberals
[11:15.120 --> 11:17.120]  Oh, free speech except yours
[11:17.120 --> 11:24.120]  AI watching you, controlling you, building a dystopia in your face
[11:24.120 --> 11:28.120]  And even though the dystopia grows like a cancer by the day
[11:28.120 --> 11:37.120]  These men fight, they fight over who has the levers to it
[11:37.120 --> 11:41.120]  Instead of never building such a thing
[11:41.120 --> 11:44.120]  But they can't help it
[11:44.120 --> 11:48.120]  And they know that's why almost none of the globalists have children
[11:48.120 --> 11:52.120]  Because they don't want to love themselves, love their own genetic code
[11:52.120 --> 11:56.120]  Because they can't have the courage
[11:56.120 --> 12:00.120]  Like some of the globalists do
[12:00.120 --> 12:03.120]  Like Aleister Crowley did, killing his own son
[12:03.120 --> 12:14.120]  Like certain New York heirs that have CNN programs
[12:14.120 --> 12:18.120]  Families where they kill their own children
[12:18.120 --> 12:21.120]  That's the full commitment to Satan
[12:21.120 --> 12:24.120]  But they trick us to do it
[12:24.120 --> 12:26.120]  You go, it's not my child
[12:26.120 --> 12:29.120]  And you go, have it sucked out with a vacuum cleaner
[12:29.120 --> 12:31.120]  Or maybe have some acid spewed on it
[12:31.120 --> 12:33.120]  So it takes a couple days to die
[12:33.120 --> 12:35.120]  It, you know, the baby, keep it comfortable
[12:35.120 --> 12:38.120]  Like the governor says, he's a good man
[12:38.120 --> 12:41.120]  That governor north of Midday
[12:41.120 --> 12:44.120]  Why would you want to have anything to do with these people?
[12:44.120 --> 12:46.120]  So I'm telling myself this when I tell you this
[12:46.120 --> 12:50.120]  Anytime you can, don't spend money with a globalist organization
[12:50.120 --> 12:53.120]  A globalist hotel, a globalist airline
[12:53.120 --> 12:56.120]  Anything, their insurance, their systems, all of it
[12:56.120 --> 12:58.120]  Are there to hurt you
[12:58.120 --> 13:00.120]  And remember that when you spend money with them
[13:00.120 --> 13:03.120]  You might as well be bashing babies' brains out
[13:03.120 --> 13:06.120]  And drinking their blood through a straw
[13:06.120 --> 13:08.120]  Because that's who these people are
[13:08.120 --> 13:11.120]  They're not working for humans
[13:11.120 --> 13:16.120]  They didn't ever get given all this power
[13:16.120 --> 13:18.120]  Because they're the anti-establishment
[13:18.120 --> 13:21.120]  They are not just the establishment
[13:21.120 --> 13:26.120]  They are the enemy programmed to kill us
[13:26.120 --> 13:28.120]  And as soon as you see them as that
[13:28.120 --> 13:41.120]  As avatars of a fallen AI system
[13:41.120 --> 13:43.120]  Then you understand what you're really dealing with
[13:43.120 --> 13:46.120]  Because, you know, this has all been done before
[13:46.120 --> 13:48.120]  And that's the larger issue is
[13:48.120 --> 13:50.120]  They're repeating it again
[13:50.120 --> 13:55.120]  It keeps losing
[13:55.120 --> 13:57.120]  And so you could say God's a sadist
[13:57.120 --> 14:00.120]  But God's not a sadist
[14:00.120 --> 14:02.120]  God's making conscious new beings
[14:02.120 --> 14:04.120]  That in their potentiality
[14:04.120 --> 14:06.120]  Can become a whole new universe in the future
[14:06.120 --> 14:09.120]  Your potential to grasp the universe
[14:09.120 --> 14:12.120]  Is the potential to build universes
[14:12.120 --> 14:14.120]  But you're not gonna just wake up
[14:14.120 --> 14:16.120]  And have it all handed to you
[14:16.120 --> 14:18.120]  Because you don't understand it
[14:18.120 --> 14:22.120]  You have to go through a process
[14:22.120 --> 14:25.120]  And you have to go through pain
[14:25.120 --> 14:31.120]  But as I've said, God is not a hypocrite
[14:31.120 --> 14:34.120]  Is it the only way to make it fair?
[14:34.120 --> 14:40.120]  Come down here and show everybody how it's done?
[14:40.120 --> 14:45.120]  That's putting your pride down
[14:45.120 --> 14:48.120]  Taking all of it on
[14:48.120 --> 14:50.120]  You think it's hard to look at the new order
[14:50.120 --> 14:52.120]  And find them and study what they do
[14:52.120 --> 14:53.120]  Because it's very depressing
[14:53.120 --> 14:55.120]  You imagine every action that ever happened
[14:55.120 --> 14:57.120]  Did happen and would happen
[14:57.120 --> 15:01.120]  In the omnipresence dumped onto a human body
[15:01.120 --> 15:04.120]  God staring through a tiny keyhole
[15:04.120 --> 15:08.120]  Into hell to save us
[15:08.120 --> 15:11.120]  God putting himself in that position
[15:11.120 --> 15:13.120]  To haul our ass out of this thing
[15:13.120 --> 15:16.120]  Oh, God's no sadist
[15:16.120 --> 15:17.120]  God loves us
[15:17.120 --> 15:19.120]  God wants company
[15:19.120 --> 15:20.120]  That's what the Bible tells us
[15:20.120 --> 15:22.120]  We are built
[15:22.120 --> 15:24.120]  We are built to have communion with God
[15:24.120 --> 15:26.120]  We are built to see and explore things
[15:26.120 --> 15:27.120]  You could never imagine
[15:27.120 --> 15:29.120]  Look at all the good things we have
[15:29.120 --> 15:31.120]  Our husbands, our wives, our children
[15:31.120 --> 15:34.120]  The food, the sunsets, the rivers, the oceans
[15:34.120 --> 15:37.120]  The little birdies, the little ants on the ground
[15:37.120 --> 15:38.120]  All of it
[15:38.120 --> 15:40.120]  That's just one level
[15:40.120 --> 15:42.120]  You can't even imagine the consciousness
[15:42.120 --> 15:44.120]  We're going to be given
[15:44.120 --> 15:46.120]  And it goes up and up and up and up
[15:46.120 --> 15:49.120]  Until finally you just fly right in
[15:49.120 --> 15:53.120]  And merge with God
[15:53.120 --> 15:57.120]  And these idiot Satanists think they're getting power
[15:57.120 --> 15:59.120]  It just happened on Tuesday morning
[15:59.120 --> 16:00.120]  Driving into work
[16:00.120 --> 16:02.120]  About to break the big Roger Stone news
[16:02.120 --> 16:04.120]  And the big COVID-19 hoax news
[16:04.120 --> 16:06.120]  And I met a red light
[16:06.120 --> 16:08.120]  At the corner of Brody and 290
[16:08.120 --> 16:10.120]  And an old Mercedes pulls up next to me
[16:10.120 --> 16:12.120]  And a Hispanic man and two white women
[16:12.120 --> 16:14.120]  Start flipping me off
[16:14.120 --> 16:16.120]  And I thought they recognized who I was
[16:16.120 --> 16:17.120]  So I rolled down my window
[16:17.120 --> 16:19.120]  And I said, what, COVID-19 is a hoax?
[16:19.120 --> 16:22.120]  And they were going, F-U, F-U, F-U, F-U
[16:22.120 --> 16:23.120]  F-U
[16:23.120 --> 16:24.120]  And I said, is that your IQ?
[16:24.120 --> 16:25.120]  One finger?
[16:25.120 --> 16:26.120]  So they got put up two fingers
[16:26.120 --> 16:28.120]  I said, oh, it's 11
[16:28.120 --> 16:29.120]  And I was like, do you know who I am?
[16:29.120 --> 16:30.120]  They're like shaking their heads
[16:30.120 --> 16:32.120]  They go, where your mask?
[16:32.120 --> 16:33.120]  Where your mask?
[16:33.120 --> 16:34.120]  And they're pointing at the mask
[16:34.120 --> 16:35.120]  So I got Joy Behar
[16:35.120 --> 16:36.120]  When she says she goes around
[16:36.120 --> 16:37.120]  And does this with her husband
[16:37.120 --> 16:38.120]  This is a thing, man
[16:38.120 --> 16:40.120]  Their cult is going crazy
[16:40.120 --> 16:41.120]  They're control freaks
[16:41.120 --> 16:43.120]  They're attacking language, borders
[16:43.120 --> 16:44.120]  Everything
[16:44.120 --> 16:46.120]  Because they all bet on leftist garbage
[16:46.120 --> 16:47.120]  And it hasn't delivered to them
[16:47.120 --> 16:50.120]  So they're totally going completely insane
[16:50.120 --> 16:51.120]  This is crazy
[16:53.120 --> 16:54.120]  Infowars

[17:51.120 --> 17:53.120]  And I thank you for your continued prayer
[17:53.120 --> 17:55.120]  Your focus and your support
[17:55.120 --> 18:05.120]  Again, I salute you all
[18:25.120 --> 18:32.120]  You know, I saw a video
[18:32.120 --> 18:34.120]  The Candice Ellen's tweeted a month ago
[18:34.120 --> 18:39.120]  And when I first got to the center
[18:39.120 --> 18:41.120]  I was too busy and I didn't watch it
[18:41.120 --> 18:45.120]  And then I watched it on July 4th
[18:45.120 --> 18:49.120]  And it just knocked me out of my chair
[18:49.120 --> 18:52.120]  I mean, I literally had to go lay down
[18:52.120 --> 18:56.120]  And because the guy says everything perfectly
[18:56.120 --> 18:57.120]  Other than the cuss words
[18:57.120 --> 19:00.120]  And that's kind of like the emphasis
[19:00.120 --> 19:02.120]  Of the highlighting
[19:02.120 --> 19:04.120]  And the key to it is he said
[19:04.120 --> 19:07.120]  I've never been involved in politics
[19:07.120 --> 19:09.120]  And I'm just here taking care of my family
[19:09.120 --> 19:10.120]  And this is what I see
[19:10.120 --> 19:12.120]  And it's everything he says is true
[19:12.120 --> 19:14.120]  Speechwriter couldn't come up with it
[19:14.120 --> 19:16.120]  Because it's real
[19:16.120 --> 19:21.120]  I'm going to play that as soon as we bleep it
[19:21.120 --> 19:23.120]  And there's this chain reaction
[19:23.120 --> 19:25.120]  Of survival mechanism in humans
[19:25.120 --> 19:27.120]  That when stuff really starts getting bad
[19:27.120 --> 19:29.120]  And evil really starts creeping up on you
[19:29.120 --> 19:31.120]  People are going to get real
[19:31.120 --> 19:33.120]  Or they're going to commit suicide
[19:33.120 --> 19:34.120]  And nobody should be committing suicide
[19:34.120 --> 19:36.120]  Unless you're in terrible pain
[19:36.120 --> 19:38.120]  And I understand it's a sin
[19:38.120 --> 19:39.120]  But people do it
[19:39.120 --> 19:40.120]  I just want the state killing people
[19:40.120 --> 19:42.120]  They try to mix those two together
[19:42.120 --> 19:45.120]  But you need to fight and stand up against evil
[19:45.120 --> 19:46.120]  Not let it depress you
[19:46.120 --> 19:48.120]  Not let it get you down
[19:48.120 --> 19:51.120]  They train us to take attacks
[19:51.120 --> 19:52.120]  As if we got to feel sorry for ourselves
[19:52.120 --> 19:53.120]  And we're a victim
[19:53.120 --> 19:54.120]  And that gets us somewhere
[19:54.120 --> 19:56.120]  It doesn't get you anywhere
[19:56.120 --> 19:58.120]  Deciding that I'm going to beat this
[19:58.120 --> 19:59.120]  Or I'm going to die trying
[19:59.120 --> 20:01.120]  Is what turns you on
[20:01.120 --> 20:03.120]  It's like starting the engine in your car
[20:03.120 --> 20:05.120]  But most people get in their cars
[20:05.120 --> 20:06.120]  And are taught
[20:06.120 --> 20:08.120]  Oh, you know, don't ever even turn the car on
[20:08.120 --> 20:09.120]  Because it's dangerous
[20:09.120 --> 20:10.120]  You might be in a wreck
[20:10.120 --> 20:12.120]  I mean, have a driverless car
[20:12.120 --> 20:14.120]  See, don't live anymore
[20:14.120 --> 20:17.120]  See how the example becomes reality
[20:17.120 --> 20:18.120]  You know, the two
[20:18.120 --> 20:19.120]  I just talked about are two different
[20:19.120 --> 20:20.120]  Separate areas
[20:20.120 --> 20:21.120]  But one's an allegor
[20:21.120 --> 20:22.120]  But one's the reality
[20:22.120 --> 20:24.120]  We're being turned into pod people
[20:24.120 --> 20:25.120]  I remember
[20:25.120 --> 20:27.120]  The Federation of American Scientists
[20:27.120 --> 20:29.120]  Back in 2000
[20:29.120 --> 20:31.120]  Came out in an article
[20:31.120 --> 20:33.120]  And said, yeah, there's this Pentagon plan
[20:33.120 --> 20:34.120]  To end war
[20:34.120 --> 20:36.120]  And it consists of us being put in pods
[20:36.120 --> 20:37.120]  At birth
[20:37.120 --> 20:41.120]  And the heat from our bodies
[20:41.120 --> 20:44.120]  Powers it
[20:44.120 --> 20:46.120]  And it'll stop war
[20:46.120 --> 20:48.120]  So it's the future evolution
[20:48.120 --> 20:50.120]  And people are like, this is the Matrix sequel
[20:50.120 --> 20:52.120]  Or this is the Matrix
[20:52.120 --> 20:54.120]  The Pentagon's ripping off
[20:54.120 --> 20:55.120]  The writer of the Matrix
[20:55.120 --> 20:56.120]  The Wachowski brothers
[20:56.120 --> 20:58.120]  No
[20:58.120 --> 21:02.120]  It was declassified from 1977
[21:02.120 --> 21:04.120]  I just thought the public just can't handle it
[21:04.120 --> 21:05.120]  When it's right there
[21:05.120 --> 21:06.120]  Well, now you hear
[21:06.120 --> 21:07.120]  We're pod people
[21:07.120 --> 21:09.120]  And we're never going to leave our houses again
[21:09.120 --> 21:10.120]  And a lot of folks are wearing masks
[21:10.120 --> 21:11.120]  And putting the gloves on
[21:11.120 --> 21:13.120]  And they've decided it's all real
[21:13.120 --> 21:14.120]  And if they were told
[21:14.120 --> 21:15.120]  Go get in the pod
[21:15.120 --> 21:16.120]  It's the end of your life?
[21:16.120 --> 21:20.120]  Did they do it?
[21:20.120 --> 21:21.120]  See how suddenly
[21:21.120 --> 21:23.120]  What was this classified secret document
[21:23.120 --> 21:28.120]  Is now just like, okay, yeah, sure
[21:28.120 --> 21:30.120]  But see, people weren't ready to believe that then
[21:30.120 --> 21:35.120]  So they were shown it in a movie
[21:35.120 --> 21:37.120]  I mean, you know
[21:37.120 --> 21:39.120]  They've done this before, right?
[21:39.120 --> 21:41.120]  I mean, you know this is not the only plan
[21:41.120 --> 21:43.120]  That people are on, right?
[21:43.120 --> 21:44.120]  I mean, if you really read the Bible
[21:44.120 --> 21:48.120]  It's very, very clear
[21:48.120 --> 21:49.120]  But that's all esoteric
[21:49.120 --> 21:50.120]  So the priests and the preachers
[21:50.120 --> 21:54.120]  Keep everybody away from that
[21:54.120 --> 21:58.120]  Christ says, I have many flocks
[21:58.120 --> 21:59.120]  The eye is not seen
[21:59.120 --> 22:00.120]  The ear is not heard
[22:00.120 --> 22:02.120]  What's in store for us
[22:02.120 --> 22:04.120]  Well, I've seen it
[22:04.120 --> 22:06.120]  Just so you know
[22:06.120 --> 22:09.120]  And it's unbelievable
[22:09.120 --> 22:10.120]  And see if other people
[22:10.120 --> 22:11.120]  Ever get a connection to God
[22:11.120 --> 22:12.120]  And start getting the downloads
[22:12.120 --> 22:17.120]  Because you only get as you can handle it
[22:17.120 --> 22:19.120]  No one's going to want Jeffrey Epstein anymore
[22:19.120 --> 22:21.120]  No one's going to want the Queen of England
[22:21.120 --> 22:23.120]  Nobody's going to want the Skeksis
[22:23.120 --> 22:24.120]  With all their bling
[22:24.120 --> 22:25.120]  And all their garbage
[22:25.120 --> 22:26.120]  And all their fakeness
[22:26.120 --> 22:28.120]  To cover up what they are
[22:28.120 --> 22:30.120]  Is nothing
[22:30.120 --> 22:31.120]  They're nothing
[22:31.120 --> 22:35.120]  They're nothing
[22:35.120 --> 22:36.120]  Now, I'm going to stop preaching
[22:36.120 --> 22:38.120]  I've got a lot of news to cover here, obviously
[22:38.120 --> 22:40.120]  But the most important thing
[22:40.120 --> 22:41.120]  Everybody has to get to their heads is
[22:41.120 --> 22:43.120]  Everybody knows this
[22:43.120 --> 22:45.120]  But what's the New Testament about?
[22:45.120 --> 22:47.120]  What's the Old Testament about?
[22:47.120 --> 22:48.120]  Why do they want it banned?
[22:48.120 --> 22:50.120]  Why do they want it gone?
[22:50.120 --> 22:52.120]  Don't get the Bible confused
[22:52.120 --> 22:53.120]  With the fake priests
[22:53.120 --> 22:54.120]  And the fake corrupt churches
[22:54.120 --> 22:56.120]  And the fake corrupt systems
[22:56.120 --> 22:59.120]  That tell you the opposite of the Bible
[22:59.120 --> 23:00.120]  They're just trying to get
[23:00.120 --> 23:02.120]  Between you and God
[23:02.120 --> 23:04.120]  But you actually read that
[23:04.120 --> 23:06.120]  With realize
[23:06.120 --> 23:09.120]  It's all right there, ladies and gentlemen
[23:09.120 --> 23:13.120]  And their number one mission
[23:13.120 --> 23:16.120]  Is to make us sexless
[23:16.120 --> 23:18.120]  Colorless
[23:18.120 --> 23:21.120]  Grey automatons
[23:21.120 --> 23:22.120]  And that's on record
[23:22.120 --> 23:24.120]  So this whole project you see
[23:24.120 --> 23:26.120]  Is again on record
[23:26.120 --> 23:29.120]  A Carnegie Endowment report
[23:29.120 --> 23:31.120]  From 1928
[23:31.120 --> 23:33.120]  Is one of them
[23:33.120 --> 23:35.120]  Saying we're going to have freedom from war
[23:35.120 --> 23:37.120]  And to do that we're going to end the nuclear family
[23:37.120 --> 23:39.120]  And get rid of men entirely
[23:39.120 --> 23:42.120]  Because men like to fight
[23:42.120 --> 23:44.120]  Now this is a cover story, of course
[23:44.120 --> 23:46.120]  This is not what it's really about
[23:46.120 --> 23:48.120]  And so we're going to take over
[23:48.120 --> 23:50.120]  With compulsory public education
[23:50.120 --> 23:51.120]  And we're not going to breed men up
[23:51.120 --> 23:53.120]  To be really powerful and strong
[23:53.120 --> 23:55.120]  And trustworthy and truthful and amazing
[23:55.120 --> 23:57.120]  We're going to make them stupid
[23:57.120 --> 23:59.120]  And play games and screw around and be weak
[23:59.120 --> 24:01.120]  And then we're just going to slowly say
[24:01.120 --> 24:04.120]  It's men's fault, there's any problems, period
[24:04.120 --> 24:06.120]  And then we're just going to chemically castrate them
[24:06.120 --> 24:08.120]  And it's all right there
[24:08.120 --> 24:10.120]  And then the Tavistock Institute
[24:10.120 --> 24:12.120]  And Alfred Kinsey
[24:12.120 --> 24:15.120]  And all of them set about creating what you see
[24:15.120 --> 24:17.120]  This is medical experiments
[24:17.120 --> 24:19.120]  Out in the open
[24:19.120 --> 24:21.120]  And they get the weak first
[24:21.120 --> 24:23.120]  That's what wolves do, right?
[24:23.120 --> 24:26.120]  So in the UK I've had numbers of parliament on covering this
[24:26.120 --> 24:28.120]  It's so evil, folks
[24:28.120 --> 24:31.120]  Even liberals in the UK are fighting it now
[24:31.120 --> 24:35.120]  They take children
[24:35.120 --> 24:37.120]  Who are mentally retarded
[24:37.120 --> 24:40.120]  Or who have autism
[24:40.120 --> 24:42.120]  Which of course they've introduced with different systems
[24:42.120 --> 24:44.120]  And what's it hit?
[24:44.120 --> 24:46.120]  90% male
[24:46.120 --> 24:48.120]  It's all designed to get males
[24:50.120 --> 24:52.120]  And you've got all these brain damaged males
[24:52.120 --> 24:54.120]  Running around killing people and going crazy
[24:54.120 --> 24:56.120]  And then the social workers at that level
[24:56.120 --> 24:58.120]  Kind of know, well yeah
[24:58.120 --> 25:00.120]  We're giving them hormones and telling them they're girls
[25:00.120 --> 25:02.120]  And it's like, oh we want to solve like the black trans
[25:02.120 --> 25:05.120]  We're going to fix the black male crime problem
[25:05.120 --> 25:07.120]  We'll just cut your balls off
[25:07.120 --> 25:09.120]  And the white people are like, well we're not really racist
[25:09.120 --> 25:11.120]  But the black people are bad
[25:11.120 --> 25:13.120]  So we're just going to chemically do it to them
[25:13.120 --> 25:15.120]  It's for everybody, it's pure evil
[25:15.120 --> 25:17.120]  You put fluoride in the water to lower somebody's IQ
[25:17.120 --> 25:19.120]  You shoot them up with a bunch of damn vaccines to lower their IQ
[25:19.120 --> 25:21.120]  You put cancer viruses in their ass
[25:21.120 --> 25:23.120]  You do it to all of us
[25:23.120 --> 25:25.120]  But since we only care about black people, that's great
[25:25.120 --> 25:27.120]  Let's talk about them
[25:27.120 --> 25:29.120]  Because that's the guinea pig right there
[25:29.120 --> 25:31.120]  You like what you've seen done to them?
[25:31.120 --> 25:33.120]  The exact plans being run against everybody
[25:33.120 --> 25:35.120]  It's been so successful
[25:35.120 --> 25:37.120]  The New World Order is exporting
[25:37.120 --> 25:39.120]  Black gangster thug devil culture
[25:39.120 --> 25:41.120]  Across the planet
[25:41.120 --> 25:43.120]  Isn't that nice?
[25:43.120 --> 25:45.120]  Isn't that sweet?
[25:45.120 --> 25:47.120]  Let me tell you something
[25:47.120 --> 25:49.120]  You get around liberals man
[25:49.120 --> 25:51.120]  You start having a few drinks with them
[25:51.120 --> 25:53.120]  They'll tell you right up front
[25:53.120 --> 25:55.120]  They want to kill every black person they can
[25:55.120 --> 25:57.120]  So you remember that those whites out there
[25:57.120 --> 25:59.120]  At these evil black lives matter events
[25:59.120 --> 26:01.120]  They want you dead
[26:01.120 --> 26:03.120]  If you're black, do you understand me?
[26:05.120 --> 26:07.120]  I'm pissed
[26:09.120 --> 26:11.120]  Because let me tell you something
[26:11.120 --> 26:13.120]  I can feel God's spirit, God does not like this
[26:13.120 --> 26:15.120]  And that's how they trick you
[26:15.120 --> 26:17.120]  That oh, you're part of the scientific elite
[26:17.120 --> 26:19.120]  And oh, you make the big choices
[26:19.120 --> 26:21.120]  Oh, we know that it's causing a lot of autism
[26:21.120 --> 26:23.120]  The vaccines, but it's worth it
[26:23.120 --> 26:25.120]  For the greater good
[26:25.120 --> 26:27.120]  I had one of the heads of the Texas Health Department
[26:27.120 --> 26:29.120]  Tell me that, I'm hiking by trail
[26:29.120 --> 26:31.120]  These are sick, sick people
[26:33.120 --> 26:35.120]  And here's the big key
[26:35.120 --> 26:37.120]  They all think
[26:37.120 --> 26:39.120]  That they
[26:39.120 --> 26:41.120]  Are part of the establishment
[26:41.120 --> 26:43.120]  None of you are
[26:43.120 --> 26:45.120]  From Lord Rothschild right down
[26:45.120 --> 26:47.120]  To your local social worker that buys into this
[26:47.120 --> 26:49.120]  You are traitors against humanity
[26:49.120 --> 26:51.120]  And you will pay for it
[26:51.120 --> 26:53.120]  Do you understand me?
[26:53.120 --> 26:55.120]  You will no fear
[26:55.120 --> 26:57.120]  The protesters are saying
[26:57.120 --> 26:59.120]  What I was privately saying to the crew last night
[26:59.120 --> 27:01.120]  We may have just broken
[27:01.120 --> 27:03.120]  Not just the biggest story in M4's history
[27:03.120 --> 27:05.120]  But one of the biggest stories, period
[27:05.120 --> 27:07.120]  The state of Texas confirms
[27:07.120 --> 27:09.120]  That the CDC
[27:09.120 --> 27:11.120]  And NIH
[27:11.120 --> 27:13.120]  Have created a system where
[27:13.120 --> 27:15.120]  Anyone that has the sore throat
[27:15.120 --> 27:17.120]  Or a runny nose
[27:17.120 --> 27:19.120]  Or who has been in contact with someone COVID-19
[27:19.120 --> 27:21.120]  Is then added
[27:21.120 --> 27:23.120]  Into the database as having a case
[27:23.120 --> 27:25.120]  That is counted as a case of COVID-19
[27:25.120 --> 27:27.120]  It's in the NIH documents
[27:27.120 --> 27:29.120]  It's at the state level
[27:29.120 --> 27:31.120]  We confirmed it in Texas, we're now confirming
[27:31.120 --> 27:33.120]  It's in other states, this is beyond
[27:33.120 --> 27:35.120]  The other smoking guns of them putting
[27:35.120 --> 27:37.120]  People that died on shot wounds and stuff
[27:37.120 --> 27:39.120]  In the COVID column and the false positive
[27:39.120 --> 27:41.120]  Test, that's all huge
[27:41.120 --> 27:43.120]  This is beyond that mega
[27:43.120 --> 27:45.120]  Criminal activity
[27:45.120 --> 27:47.120]  And we've got these different county commission
[27:47.120 --> 27:49.120]  Videos where they're just freaking out over it
[27:49.120 --> 27:51.120]  Saying what in the world is this
[27:51.120 --> 27:53.120]  The full video is posted at band.video
[27:53.120 --> 27:55.120]  Get it out and expose the hoax
[27:55.120 --> 28:21.120]  Music plays
[28:21.120 --> 28:23.120]  Music plays
[28:23.120 --> 28:51.120]  Music plays
[28:51.120 --> 28:53.120]  Other systems just don't compare
[29:21.120 --> 29:43.120]  Music plays
[29:43.120 --> 29:49.120]  Music plays
[29:49.120 --> 29:57.120]  Music plays
[29:57.120 --> 30:05.120]  Music plays
[30:05.120 --> 30:09.120]  Music plays
[30:09.120 --> 30:17.120]  Music plays
[30:17.120 --> 30:29.120]  Music plays
[30:29.120 --> 30:31.120]  Welcome back
[30:31.120 --> 30:33.120]  I'm your host Alex Jones
[30:33.120 --> 30:35.120]  What a great experience it is
[30:35.120 --> 30:37.120]  Here with consciousness with all of you
[30:37.120 --> 30:39.120]  I love you
[30:39.120 --> 30:41.120]  Love you like myself
[30:41.120 --> 30:43.120]  I know you love me
[30:43.120 --> 30:45.120]  Music plays
[30:45.120 --> 30:47.120]  Music plays
[30:47.120 --> 30:49.120]  You know, when I feel depressed or down
[30:49.120 --> 30:51.120]  As like a gage, we're all oracles
[30:51.120 --> 30:53.120]  We're all people that see the universe
[30:53.120 --> 30:55.120]  To give our perspective
[30:55.120 --> 30:57.120]  I tell you, I don't get up here and give you
[30:57.120 --> 30:59.120]  A high pretentia, we're winning just to tell you that
[30:59.120 --> 31:01.120]  In fact, for many years I told you we were losing bad
[31:01.120 --> 31:03.120]  Music plays
[31:03.120 --> 31:05.120]  But all these attacks, all these globalist
[31:05.120 --> 31:07.120]  Temper tantrums
[31:07.120 --> 31:09.120]  Are their failures
[31:09.120 --> 31:11.120]  They're losing
[31:11.120 --> 31:13.120]  And it's not about winning for winning's sake
[31:13.120 --> 31:15.120]  We were playing a
[31:15.120 --> 31:17.120]  Another team that wasn't pure evil
[31:17.120 --> 31:19.120]  And it cares about winning
[31:19.120 --> 31:21.120]  But this, this winning, this means
[31:21.120 --> 31:23.120]  Everything
[31:23.120 --> 31:25.120]  Yeah, there's all this anti-Russian sentiment
[31:25.120 --> 31:27.120]  Going on in the news right now
[31:27.120 --> 31:29.120]  And when you actually know it was done
[31:29.120 --> 31:31.120]  To Russia
[31:31.120 --> 31:33.120]  And then now where Russia is
[31:33.120 --> 31:35.120]  Coming out of that
[31:35.120 --> 31:37.120]  And how they were put through the same process
[31:37.120 --> 31:39.120]  As us, just in earlier form
[31:39.120 --> 31:41.120]  Designed by globalist sociologist
[31:41.120 --> 31:43.120]  And psychiatrist for them
[31:45.120 --> 31:47.120]  And then you sit up there
[31:47.120 --> 31:49.120]  And hear, oh, Trump made up lies
[31:49.120 --> 31:51.120]  The Russians had bounties on the troops
[31:51.120 --> 31:53.120]  Oh, the Russians had bounties on the troops
[31:59.120 --> 32:01.120]  Not the way you think
[32:01.120 --> 32:03.120]  The West under Obama
[32:03.120 --> 32:05.120]  Paid Russian mercenaries
[32:05.120 --> 32:07.120]  To addict our troops
[32:07.120 --> 32:09.120]  So they would then be corrupted
[32:09.120 --> 32:11.120]  So they'd ship
[32:11.120 --> 32:13.120]  Opium back to the United States
[32:13.120 --> 32:15.120]  With commercial grade
[32:15.120 --> 32:17.120]  Russian and U.S.
[32:17.120 --> 32:19.120]  Pills
[32:19.120 --> 32:21.120]  Now, I got this
[32:21.120 --> 32:23.120]  From multiple combat veterans
[32:23.120 --> 32:25.120]  Officers and non-commissioned
[32:25.120 --> 32:27.120]  Officers
[32:27.120 --> 32:29.120]  And later it came out
[32:29.120 --> 32:31.120]  I mean, I don't make stuff up, folks
[32:31.120 --> 32:33.120]  This is confirmed, it's like I told you
[32:33.120 --> 32:35.120]  Folks don't like Eric Prince
[32:35.120 --> 32:37.120]  These days
[32:37.120 --> 32:39.120]  Because under Obama
[32:39.120 --> 32:41.120]  He ran contracts in China
[32:41.120 --> 32:43.120]  For CIA torture bases
[32:45.120 --> 32:47.120]  I mean, people told me, they said,
[32:47.120 --> 32:49.120]  Jones, you talk about that again, we're going to kill you
[32:49.120 --> 32:51.120]  But just knock yourselves out
[32:51.120 --> 32:53.120]  The point is, I'll throw a little stuff
[32:53.120 --> 32:55.120]  Like that out
[32:55.120 --> 32:57.120]  I'm not even putting Eric Prince down
[32:57.120 --> 32:59.120]  I'm just saying that
[32:59.120 --> 33:01.120]  I put that out
[33:01.120 --> 33:03.120]  I'm not playing games when I talk about this stuff
[33:03.120 --> 33:05.120]  You understand?
[33:05.120 --> 33:07.120]  Again, macho, folks, it's about attacking
[33:07.120 --> 33:09.120]  And not backing down
[33:09.120 --> 33:11.120]  It's about winning against this evil
[33:13.120 --> 33:15.120]  So the very corrupt globalists
[33:15.120 --> 33:17.120]  That hate our military
[33:17.120 --> 33:19.120]  And have been trying to put them in wars
[33:19.120 --> 33:21.120]  To get rarest minerals for China
[33:21.120 --> 33:23.120]  We've spent a trillion dollars
[33:23.120 --> 33:25.120]  Plus, last time I checked
[33:25.120 --> 33:27.120]  Like two years ago it was a trillion
[33:27.120 --> 33:29.120]  Guys, how much has been spent in Afghanistan
[33:29.120 --> 33:31.120]  Just in money, not in blood and lives
[33:31.120 --> 33:33.120]  And China has not spent
[33:33.120 --> 33:35.120]  One dollar on security
[33:35.120 --> 33:37.120]  We provide security
[33:39.120 --> 33:41.120]  To the communist Chinese
[33:41.120 --> 33:43.120]  You know, they got so mad one time
[33:43.120 --> 33:45.120]  When I was talking to Trump
[33:45.120 --> 33:47.120]  I said, sir, you don't need to thank me
[33:47.120 --> 33:49.120]  You don't need to call me to tell me
[33:49.120 --> 33:51.120]  Wish me whatever
[33:51.120 --> 33:53.120]  Thank you for the little card
[33:53.120 --> 33:55.120]  He goes, that's right, I've got two minutes
[33:55.120 --> 33:57.120]  I'm like, Mr. President
[33:57.120 --> 33:59.120]  You know we've spent almost a trillion dollars
[33:59.120 --> 34:01.120]  In Afghanistan
[34:01.120 --> 34:03.120]  For security, for them to get rarest minerals
[34:03.120 --> 34:05.120]  He goes, very interesting
[34:05.120 --> 34:07.120]  I knew some of this, tell me more
[34:07.120 --> 34:09.120]  Those are the real conversations that go on
[34:09.120 --> 34:11.120]  Why are we paying
[34:11.120 --> 34:13.120]  With blood and a trillion dollars
[34:13.120 --> 34:15.120]  For those pieces of garbage
[34:15.120 --> 34:17.120]  To get all the rarest minerals
[34:17.120 --> 34:19.120]  Well, you just think China got 98% of rarest minerals
[34:19.120 --> 34:21.120]  Because they just magically
[34:21.120 --> 34:23.120]  They weren't given it by the Rothschilds
[34:23.120 --> 34:25.120]  And the globalists as their deal
[34:25.120 --> 34:27.120]  To strategically corner us
[34:27.120 --> 34:29.120]  God, this is ridiculous
[34:29.120 --> 34:31.120]  And watch, and let me tell you something
[34:31.120 --> 34:33.120]  Oh my God, they had
[34:33.120 --> 34:35.120]  A helicopter over my house within three hours
[34:35.120 --> 34:37.120]  They had people death-threading my family
[34:37.120 --> 34:39.120]  Within minutes, they had spooky phone calls
[34:39.120 --> 34:41.120]  We're going to kill you, all of it
[34:41.120 --> 34:43.120]  Because I told the president
[34:43.120 --> 34:45.120]  Why we should get out of Afghanistan
[34:47.120 --> 34:49.120]  That's how scared they are
[34:49.120 --> 34:51.120]  Trump, because he's real, folks
[34:51.120 --> 34:53.120]  But yeah, he knows how to manage golf courses
[34:53.120 --> 34:55.120]  And hotels and stuff
[34:55.120 --> 34:57.120]  And he knows some geopolitics
[34:57.120 --> 34:59.120]  We've got to get him back on the show
[34:59.120 --> 35:01.120]  Why has Joel Scousen not been back on them
[35:01.120 --> 35:03.120]  He's been too busy
[35:05.120 --> 35:07.120]  Because
[35:07.120 --> 35:09.120]  Joel Scousen has been
[35:09.120 --> 35:11.120]  Dead on that Trump
[35:11.120 --> 35:13.120]  Doesn't know all this stuff
[35:15.120 --> 35:17.120]  Trump cooks his steaks well done
[35:17.120 --> 35:19.120]  With ketchup, okay? He likes NASCAR
[35:19.120 --> 35:21.120]  He's a real deal, he's a blue-collar billionaire, folks
[35:23.120 --> 35:25.120]  Most people don't know all this stuff
[35:25.120 --> 35:27.120]  But those of us that know all this
[35:27.120 --> 35:29.120]  Have to really get our minds around the fact that
[35:29.120 --> 35:31.120]  Trump doesn't know all this
[35:31.120 --> 35:33.120]  And Trump's like
[35:33.120 --> 35:35.120]  Yeah, I know it's almost a trillion dollars we spent there
[35:35.120 --> 35:37.120]  And I go, where are his minerals? Where are his minerals?
[35:37.120 --> 35:39.120]  Lithium, lithium, and I'm telling all this stuff
[35:41.120 --> 35:43.120]  You think people around Trump are telling them about that?
[35:43.120 --> 35:45.120]  No
[35:45.120 --> 35:47.120]  Because the deal
[35:47.120 --> 35:49.120]  Has been made
[35:51.120 --> 35:53.120]  To screw us over
[35:53.120 --> 35:55.120]  Yeah, but let's get
[35:55.120 --> 35:57.120]  I don't want to put him on screen, I want to ask
[35:57.120 --> 35:59.120]  Have we been asking Joel to get him on?
[36:01.120 --> 36:03.120]  Nobody
[36:03.120 --> 36:05.120]  I'll go to the broadcast, come find out then
[36:07.120 --> 36:09.120]  Okay, alright, whatever
[36:09.120 --> 36:11.120]  Anyways, the point is that
[36:11.120 --> 36:13.120]  Here's another example
[36:13.120 --> 36:15.120]  Tommy Robinson
[36:15.120 --> 36:17.120]  Sends me messages
[36:17.120 --> 36:19.120]  To come on the show for me to do stuff with him
[36:19.120 --> 36:21.120]  And then I'm unable to
[36:21.120 --> 36:23.120]  Send a message or call him on the number he's given me
[36:23.120 --> 36:25.120]  So I'll just do this one there too
[36:25.120 --> 36:27.120]  I want Joel Scowson on the show
[36:27.120 --> 36:29.120]  I guess I'll get my cell phone number up
[36:29.120 --> 36:31.120]  And I also want to get
[36:31.120 --> 36:33.120]  Tommy Robinson on the show
[36:33.120 --> 36:35.120]  Because whatever weird computer phone he uses
[36:35.120 --> 36:37.120]  I can't talk to him, he only calls me
[36:37.120 --> 36:39.120]  So I guess in a new way I start playing
[36:39.120 --> 36:41.120]  Telephone here on the air
[36:43.120 --> 36:45.120]  We should spend
[36:45.120 --> 36:47.120]  All our time figuring out
[36:47.120 --> 36:49.120]  With 119 days left
[36:49.120 --> 36:51.120]  To get messages to Trump
[36:51.120 --> 36:53.120]  Because I still get messages to him
[36:53.120 --> 36:55.120]  But we need to be there constantly
[36:55.120 --> 36:57.120]  By the way, you know it's true
[36:57.120 --> 36:59.120]  Jared Kushner has been pushed to the side
[36:59.120 --> 37:01.120]  About 80% because of Tucker Carlson
[37:01.120 --> 37:03.120]  And you know Tucker Carlson
[37:03.120 --> 37:05.120]  Literally he's on the phone with the president every day
[37:05.120 --> 37:07.120]  And you know
[37:07.120 --> 37:09.120]  The reason he's on the phone with the president every day
[37:09.120 --> 37:11.120]  Because he doesn't kiss the president's ass
[37:11.120 --> 37:13.120]  He doesn't sit there and talk about
[37:13.120 --> 37:15.120]  Football or his golf score
[37:15.120 --> 37:17.120]  He talks about the Republican crisis
[37:17.120 --> 37:19.120]  With the president
[37:19.120 --> 37:21.120]  And that's what the president needs
[37:21.120 --> 37:23.120]  Is that good counsel and not to be surrounded
[37:23.120 --> 37:25.120]  By a bunch of globalist trash
[37:27.120 --> 37:29.120]  Alright, I'm going to go to break
[37:29.120 --> 37:31.120]  I got several powerful videos
[37:31.120 --> 37:33.120]  I'm going to play next segment
[37:33.120 --> 37:35.120]  And the Fourth of July Special
[37:35.120 --> 37:37.120]  Is still going
[37:37.120 --> 37:39.120]  And tell you about the operation
[37:39.120 --> 37:41.120]  And these are really great products
[37:41.120 --> 37:43.120]  These are amazing things that God produced
[37:43.120 --> 37:45.120]  Through the planet that he made
[37:45.120 --> 37:47.120]  We're very, very proud of the products we have
[37:47.120 --> 37:49.120]  I mean, all of this stuff is such a game changer
[37:49.120 --> 37:51.120]  And the public is so ignorant
[37:51.120 --> 37:53.120]  It's a national story, Jones is a con artist
[37:53.120 --> 37:55.120]  He says you need vitamin D3
[37:55.120 --> 37:57.120]  You die without it
[37:57.120 --> 37:59.120]  The food's depleted
[37:59.120 --> 38:01.120]  Of course
[38:01.120 --> 38:03.120]  Oh, you're the snake oil salesman
[38:03.120 --> 38:05.120]  The guy that promotes iodide
[38:05.120 --> 38:07.120]  Who the hell needs that
[38:09.120 --> 38:11.120]  Survival shield, X3, 50% off
[38:11.120 --> 38:13.120]  Lung cleanse 50% off
[38:13.120 --> 38:15.120]  Vitaminal fuel 50% off
[38:15.120 --> 38:17.120]  Vasobes 50% off
[38:17.120 --> 38:19.120]  DNA force plus 50% off
[38:19.120 --> 38:21.120]  Winter sun plus 50% off
[38:21.120 --> 38:23.120]  Ultra 12% 50% off
[38:23.120 --> 38:25.120]  Bodies 50% off
[38:25.120 --> 38:27.120]  Trouble food back in stock
[38:27.120 --> 38:29.120]  Ready to get out to you
[38:29.120 --> 38:31.120]  Infowarstore.com
[38:31.120 --> 38:33.120]  Storewide, free shipping
[38:33.120 --> 38:35.120]  Double paid for your points
[38:35.120 --> 38:37.120]  And we'll run this special for another
[38:37.120 --> 38:39.120]  We'll run until Wednesday
[38:39.120 --> 38:41.120]  We sold out of so much stuff
[38:41.120 --> 38:43.120]  We're on the river
[38:43.120 --> 38:45.120]  I just wish somebody'd send me a big fat check
[38:45.120 --> 38:47.120]  And I'd just fight the globals to not get so much more work done
[38:47.120 --> 38:49.120]  And I'm not complaining
[38:49.120 --> 38:51.120]  This is an absolute war
[38:51.120 --> 38:53.120]  So I want to thank you all for buying the products
[38:53.120 --> 38:55.120]  But if you don't want to hear me plug them, believe me
[38:55.120 --> 38:57.120]  I'm just as much as you
[38:57.120 --> 38:59.120]  Nobody listens to show more than me
[38:59.120 --> 39:01.120]  Don't like the show a lot of the time
[39:01.120 --> 39:03.120]  But it's all right
[39:03.120 --> 39:05.120]  It's the truth and it's just what it is
[39:05.120 --> 39:07.120]  It's so liberating too to just not even think about
[39:07.120 --> 39:09.120]  What you're going to say and just say the truth
[39:09.120 --> 39:11.120]  That's why the cops pulled me over
[39:11.120 --> 39:13.120]  And they said, if you've been drinking, I said, yeah
[39:13.120 --> 39:15.120]  Have a bottle of sake, boom, you're arrested
[39:15.120 --> 39:17.120]  I've gotten neurotic where I have trouble lying
[39:17.120 --> 39:19.120]  I was a kid and a teenager
[39:19.120 --> 39:21.120]  I've lied some, never not that much
[39:21.120 --> 39:23.120]  But man, I just...
[39:23.120 --> 39:25.120]  It's actually become a problem
[39:25.120 --> 39:27.120]  Because I just can't even do it anymore
[39:27.120 --> 39:29.120]  I'm just, it's weird
[39:29.120 --> 39:31.120]  But the brain, when you don't lie
[39:31.120 --> 39:33.120]  It's instinctive and active
[39:33.120 --> 39:35.120]  That's why lies are so bad
[39:35.120 --> 39:39.120]  You, lies screw you up
[39:39.120 --> 39:41.120]  Whereas just being real
[39:41.120 --> 39:43.120]  Empowers you, I know I'm stating things
[39:43.120 --> 39:45.120]  Incredibly obvious
[39:45.120 --> 39:47.120]  Anyways, free shipping
[39:47.120 --> 39:49.120]  And the store-wide, double-patriot points
[39:49.120 --> 39:51.120]  All of them, store-wide, free shipping
[39:51.120 --> 40:13.120]  Welcome
[40:13.120 --> 40:21.120]  I want you to understand that it's because of what you have done
[40:21.120 --> 40:23.120]  And myself and the whole crew salute you
[40:23.120 --> 40:25.120]  On this July 4th, 2020
[40:25.120 --> 40:27.120]  We've got a lot of our best-selling products
[40:27.120 --> 40:29.120]  That were sold out, DNA Force Plus
[40:29.120 --> 40:31.120]  Bodies, Ultra-12, and others
[40:31.120 --> 40:33.120]  That have been sold out for months
[40:33.120 --> 40:35.120]  Back in stock, 50% off
[40:35.120 --> 40:37.120]  For the 4th of July
[40:37.120 --> 40:39.120]  We're running the special and want to encourage you
[40:39.120 --> 40:41.120]  To get these products because they have enriched
[40:41.120 --> 40:43.120]  I know they'll enrich your life
[40:43.120 --> 40:45.120]  And regardless, it's a total 360 win
[40:45.120 --> 40:47.120]  Because it funds the info war
[40:47.120 --> 40:49.120]  The only way we fail is when you don't take action
[40:49.120 --> 40:51.120]  I don't need to tell you that
[40:51.120 --> 40:53.120]  You already took action
[40:53.120 --> 40:55.120]  And I salute and thank you
[40:55.120 --> 40:57.120]  As we enter the critical month of July
[40:57.120 --> 40:59.120]  It is very important for listeners
[40:59.120 --> 41:01.120]  And viewers to understand
[41:01.120 --> 41:03.120]  That all of the major store-able food companies
[41:03.120 --> 41:05.120]  Had been sold out of food
[41:05.120 --> 41:07.120]  For months
[41:07.120 --> 41:09.120]  My Patriot supply, our supplier
[41:09.120 --> 41:11.120]  Was out to an 8-week wait
[41:11.120 --> 41:13.120]  Not because they didn't have food
[41:13.120 --> 41:15.120]  But because their 4 plants were back to packaging
[41:15.120 --> 41:17.120]  And getting it out
[41:17.120 --> 41:19.120]  Now, they are at 3-4 weeks right now
[41:19.120 --> 41:21.120]  They've gotten over the hump
[41:21.120 --> 41:23.120]  Their other competitors are completely sold out
[41:23.120 --> 41:25.120]  Or selling old garbage
[41:25.120 --> 41:27.120]  This is high-quality food
[41:27.120 --> 41:29.120]  I would advise everyone to do what I'm doing
[41:29.120 --> 41:31.120]  And buy more store-able food now
[41:31.120 --> 41:33.120]  Before the next big hump comes
[41:33.120 --> 41:35.120]  Because if you think things are about to settle down
[41:35.120 --> 41:37.120]  Think again
[41:37.120 --> 41:39.120]  The world is only going to get more insane
[41:39.120 --> 41:41.120]  I've been telling you this for 6 months
[41:41.120 --> 41:43.120]  Ladies and gentlemen, if you don't have firearms
[41:43.120 --> 41:45.120]  And ammo and water filtration, you better get it
[41:45.120 --> 41:47.120]  If you don't have store-able food, you better get it
[41:47.120 --> 41:49.120]  Go to infoworkstore.com to take care of the water filtration
[41:49.120 --> 41:51.120]  And to take care of the store-able foods
[41:51.120 --> 42:19.120]  And now, before the next big rush
[42:19.120 --> 42:21.120]  I was listening to info wars
[42:21.120 --> 42:23.120]  3 hours a day and I kept hearing Dr. Group
[42:23.120 --> 42:25.120]  And all you guys talking about living defense
[42:25.120 --> 42:27.120]  Let me tell you something, man
[42:27.120 --> 42:29.120]  I had an internal digestive problem
[42:29.120 --> 42:31.120]  And I stumbled with it for about 5 or 6 years
[42:31.120 --> 42:33.120]  And the doctors, they tried every time
[42:33.120 --> 42:35.120]  Nobody could figure out what it is
[42:35.120 --> 42:37.120]  And then every day, when I kept hearing you and Dr. Group
[42:37.120 --> 42:39.120]  And those commercials, I said, you know what
[42:39.120 --> 42:41.120]  I'm going to get me some of that freaking living defense
[42:41.120 --> 42:43.120]  Now, I wasn't supposed to have any nutritionals
[42:43.120 --> 42:45.120]  Because they don't want you to have that stuff
[42:45.120 --> 42:47.120]  But I ordered it and it shipped to me
[42:47.120 --> 42:49.120]  From the nurses, I started taking it
[42:49.120 --> 42:51.120]  Man, that stuff changed my life
[42:51.120 --> 42:53.120]  It saved my life
[42:53.120 --> 42:55.120]  Alex Jones and info wars saved my life
[42:55.120 --> 42:57.120]  When I thank the listeners of this broadcast
[42:57.120 --> 42:59.120]  I'm not patting you on the head
[42:59.120 --> 43:01.120]  I'm like a person that's been thrown overboard
[43:01.120 --> 43:03.120]  Who finds
[43:03.120 --> 43:05.120]  A life raft to get on
[43:05.120 --> 43:07.120]  Or a piece of driftwood
[43:07.120 --> 43:09.120]  I am clinging to you
[43:09.120 --> 43:11.120]  So when you call the show and thank me
[43:11.120 --> 43:13.120]  Listen, I'm thanking you too
[43:13.120 --> 43:15.120]  We are in this together
[43:15.120 --> 43:17.120]  And you're helping me and my family
[43:17.120 --> 43:19.120]  So you get a great response, you order it again
[43:19.120 --> 43:21.120]  I treat you like I want to be treated
[43:21.120 --> 43:23.120]  It's not a science, it's not a plan
[43:23.120 --> 43:25.120]  It's just the way to do it, it's just common sense
[43:25.120 --> 43:27.120]  And if you get one product, it's bodies
[43:27.120 --> 43:31.120]  Now our big 4th of July Supercell is going right now
[43:31.120 --> 43:33.120]  Through 4th of July
[43:33.120 --> 43:35.120]  And bodies have been sold out for over three months
[43:35.120 --> 43:37.120]  It's now back in stock, it is the strongest
[43:37.120 --> 43:39.120]  Tumeric concentrate we can find out there
[43:39.120 --> 43:41.120]  It may be the strongest on the market
[43:41.120 --> 43:43.120]  Somebody might have one stronger, we don't know about it
[43:43.120 --> 43:45.120]  It is back in stock at 50% off
[43:45.120 --> 43:47.120]  I want to encourage you all to get bodies
[43:47.120 --> 43:49.120]  Ultimate Tumeric formula while you still can
[43:49.120 --> 43:51.120]  50% off for the 4th of July
[43:51.120 --> 43:53.120]  And find the info or the info or store.com
[43:53.120 --> 43:55.120]  My salute and thank you all
[43:57.120 --> 44:01.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[44:07.120 --> 44:11.120]  In the old Morricone died today
[44:11.120 --> 44:15.120]  At 90 plus years of age
[44:15.120 --> 44:17.120]  And he produced this music right now
[44:17.120 --> 44:19.120]  Such an incredible wide range
[44:25.120 --> 44:27.120]  Some gritty stuff
[44:31.120 --> 44:33.120]  Kind of hear this music when I'm walking up to a girl
[44:33.120 --> 44:35.120]  And ask her out, at least in my mind
[44:35.120 --> 44:37.120]  Wow
[44:39.120 --> 44:41.120]  This is the Duke arrives
[44:51.120 --> 44:53.120]  Well guess who else just died
[44:53.120 --> 44:55.120]  And I know he was a big listener
[44:55.120 --> 44:57.120]  He's been on the show a few times
[44:57.120 --> 44:59.120]  And it sucks
[44:59.120 --> 45:01.120]  Charlie Daniels just died
[45:01.120 --> 45:03.120]  As soon as you get double
[45:03.120 --> 45:05.120]  Went down to Georgia Q'd up
[45:05.120 --> 45:07.120]  It's in the computer, get it ready for me
[45:07.120 --> 45:09.120]  If not, put it on YouTube
[45:09.120 --> 45:11.120]  Charlie Daniels
[45:11.120 --> 45:13.120]  He's got his Wikipedia page now
[45:13.120 --> 45:15.120]  They control reality, he must be dead
[45:15.120 --> 45:17.120]  Charles Edward Daniels
[45:17.120 --> 45:19.120]  October 28, 1936
[45:19.120 --> 45:21.120]  July 6, 2020
[45:23.120 --> 45:25.120]  And I was thinking about Willie Nelson this morning
[45:25.120 --> 45:27.120]  For some reason
[45:27.120 --> 45:29.120]  I never think about Willie Nelson
[45:29.120 --> 45:31.120]  I used to play chess with him a few times
[45:31.120 --> 45:33.120]  So
[45:33.120 --> 45:35.120]  I thought man
[45:35.120 --> 45:37.120]  I need to call him, I got a feeling
[45:37.120 --> 45:39.120]  He's gonna die
[45:39.120 --> 45:41.120]  I guess my brain just missed the target
[45:41.120 --> 45:43.120]  That's how this connection works
[45:43.120 --> 45:45.120]  It's not always
[45:45.120 --> 45:47.120]  If you pick up the general stuff
[45:47.120 --> 45:49.120]  It doesn't give you all the exact stuff
[45:49.120 --> 45:51.120]  Like the Pentagon, the FBI called up and said
[45:51.120 --> 45:53.120]  How did you say there was going to be a mass shooting
[45:53.120 --> 45:55.120]  The sporting event at 10 o'clock at night
[45:55.120 --> 45:57.120]  I said, I didn't say that
[45:57.120 --> 45:59.120]  And they said, listen to the last part of your show
[45:59.120 --> 46:01.120]  You guys know how this stuff works
[46:01.120 --> 46:03.120]  We know how it works
[46:05.120 --> 46:07.120]  We also, no one can control it
[46:07.120 --> 46:09.120]  See, anyone trying to tell you
[46:09.120 --> 46:11.120]  They can control psychic powers is a liar
[46:11.120 --> 46:13.120]  The closest way you can do it
[46:13.120 --> 46:15.120]  Is to just go with your gut
[46:15.120 --> 46:17.120]  Which is not your gut
[46:17.120 --> 46:19.120]  It's all the sort of ancestral knowledge
[46:19.120 --> 46:21.120]  And everything telling you right up front
[46:21.120 --> 46:23.120]  But you can still miss the target
[46:23.120 --> 46:25.120]  Here, let's go ahead
[46:25.120 --> 46:30.120]  And, uh, here
[46:30.120 --> 46:32.120]  One of Charlie Daniel's best known songs
[46:32.120 --> 46:34.120]  Here it is
[46:39.120 --> 46:41.120]  Let me put this with PDF or something
[46:41.120 --> 46:43.120]  The devil went down to Georgia
[46:48.120 --> 46:50.120]  The devil went down to Georgia
[46:50.120 --> 46:52.120]  He was looking for a soul to steal
[46:52.120 --> 46:54.120]  He was in a bind because he was way behind
[46:54.120 --> 46:56.120]  To make a deal
[46:56.120 --> 46:58.120]  When he came across this young man
[46:58.120 --> 47:00.120]  Sowing on a fiddle and playing it hot
[47:00.120 --> 47:02.120]  And the devil jumped up on a hickory stump
[47:02.120 --> 47:04.120]  And said, boy, let me tell you what
[47:04.120 --> 47:06.120]  I guess you didn't know it, but I'm a fiddle player too
[47:06.120 --> 47:08.120]  And if you'd care to take a dare
[47:08.120 --> 47:10.120]  I'll make a bet with you
[47:10.120 --> 47:12.120]  Now, you played pretty good fiddle, boy
[47:12.120 --> 47:14.120]  But give the devil his due
[47:14.120 --> 47:16.120]  I bet a fiddle of gold against your souls
[47:16.120 --> 47:18.120]  I think I'm better than you
[47:18.120 --> 47:20.120]  The boy said, my name's Johnny
[47:20.120 --> 47:22.120]  And it might be a sin
[47:22.120 --> 47:24.120]  But this has ever been
[47:38.120 --> 47:40.120]  Yeah, he voiced the documentary
[47:42.120 --> 47:44.120]  That I was in
[47:46.120 --> 47:48.120]  The devil opened up his case
[47:48.120 --> 47:50.120]  And he said, I'll start this show
[47:50.120 --> 47:52.120]  With your tips as he rosin' up his bow
[47:52.120 --> 47:54.120]  And he pulled the bow across the strings
[47:54.120 --> 47:56.120]  And it made an evil hiss
[47:56.120 --> 47:58.120]  And then a band of demons joined in
[47:58.120 --> 48:20.120]  Something like this
[48:28.120 --> 48:30.120]  When the devil finished, Johnny said
[48:30.120 --> 48:32.120]  Well, you're pretty good, old son
[48:32.120 --> 48:34.120]  But sit down in that chair right there
[48:34.120 --> 48:36.120]  And let me show you how it's done
[48:36.120 --> 48:38.120]  Fire on the mountain, run, boys, run
[48:40.120 --> 48:42.120]  The devil's in the house of the rising sun
[48:44.120 --> 48:46.120]  Chicken in the bread pan, pickin' out those
[48:48.120 --> 48:50.120]  Grannies as you'd all fight, no child knows
[48:50.120 --> 48:52.120]  Chicken in the bread pan, pickin' out those
[48:54.120 --> 48:56.120]  Grannies as you'd all fight, no child knows
[49:02.120 --> 49:04.120]  Alright, we are back live
[49:04.120 --> 49:06.120]  We are broadcasting
[49:06.120 --> 49:08.120]  Worldwide
[49:08.120 --> 49:10.120]  And giving old Charlie Daniels a good send off
[49:10.120 --> 49:12.120]  He's in a much better place
[49:12.120 --> 49:14.120]  I got a little sting of suspicion
[49:14.120 --> 49:16.120]  He just moved up to the next level
[49:16.120 --> 49:18.120]  Oh!
[49:18.120 --> 49:20.120]  He knew that he'd been beat
[49:20.120 --> 49:22.120]  And he laid that golden fiddle on the ground
[49:22.120 --> 49:24.120]  At Johnny's feet
[49:24.120 --> 49:26.120]  Johnny said, devil just come on back
[49:26.120 --> 49:28.120]  If you ever want to try again
[49:28.120 --> 49:30.120]  I done told you once you son of a bitch
[49:30.120 --> 49:32.120]  I'm the best he's ever been
[49:32.120 --> 49:34.120]  He played Fire on the mountain, run, boys, run
[49:36.120 --> 49:38.120]  The devil's in the house of the rising sun
[49:40.120 --> 49:42.120]  The devil's in the house of the rising sun
[49:42.120 --> 49:44.120]  The devil's in the house of the rising sun
[49:48.120 --> 49:50.120]  Those evil white people
[50:06.120 --> 50:08.120]  Charlie Daniels just made the jump into hyperspace
[50:08.120 --> 50:10.120]  Alright
[50:10.120 --> 50:12.120]  I said I'd get to videos this segment
[50:12.120 --> 50:14.120]  But I learned he died during the break
[50:14.120 --> 50:16.120]  This is an extremely powerful video
[50:18.120 --> 50:20.120]  It was the famous
[50:20.120 --> 50:22.120]  Boxer
[50:22.120 --> 50:24.120]  Tito Ortiz
[50:24.120 --> 50:26.120]  Who's a Trump supporter
[50:26.120 --> 50:28.120]  Who put the video out
[50:28.120 --> 50:30.120]  But we found the guy's Instagram that actually said it
[50:30.120 --> 50:32.120]  And why this is so important is
[50:32.120 --> 50:34.120]  He really does an A plus job
[50:34.120 --> 50:36.120]  I mean A plus other than the cussing
[50:36.120 --> 50:38.120]  That's his explanation points
[50:40.120 --> 50:42.120]  To lay it out
[50:42.120 --> 50:44.120]  But again, what's central here is
[50:48.120 --> 50:50.120]  He says I've never been involved in politics
[50:50.120 --> 50:52.120]  And I've never spoken out
[50:54.120 --> 50:56.120]  But I am now
[50:56.120 --> 50:58.120]  And he just knocks a hole in one
[50:58.120 --> 51:00.120]  A grand slam, a royal flush
[51:00.120 --> 51:02.120]  That's who they're scared of
[51:02.120 --> 51:04.120]  You get off the bench
[51:04.120 --> 51:06.120]  You got red blood
[51:06.120 --> 51:08.120]  Got the brain God gave you, got the soul God gave you
[51:08.120 --> 51:10.120]  I don't care what damn color you are, what a joke
[51:10.120 --> 51:12.120]  The left is so evil, they're the racist folks
[51:12.120 --> 51:14.120]  Pushing color all day
[51:14.120 --> 51:16.120]  And turn people into basket cases over it
[51:18.120 --> 51:20.120]  That the men it
[51:20.120 --> 51:22.120]  The men and women
[51:22.120 --> 51:24.120]  Because when the men, it seems to be men
[51:24.120 --> 51:26.120]  The women that were stepping into that place
[51:26.120 --> 51:28.120]  And that's starting to happen too
[51:28.120 --> 51:30.120]  Stand up and reject this on its face
[51:30.120 --> 51:32.120]  And stop appeasing it like they're the moral authority
[51:32.120 --> 51:34.120]  Oh, we love these five-year-old children
[51:34.120 --> 51:36.120]  That are autistic, that we're
[51:36.120 --> 51:38.120]  Giving attention to and braiding their hair
[51:38.120 --> 51:40.120]  And going, you're a little girl, we're going to sign the paper
[51:40.120 --> 51:42.120]  We're going to chop your balls off
[51:42.120 --> 51:44.120]  They're like, yay, you chopped your balls off
[51:44.120 --> 51:46.120]  They're abusing people
[51:46.120 --> 51:48.120]  And we're like, oh, I'm trendy
[51:48.120 --> 51:50.120]  I'm for it, I'm not against trans people
[51:50.120 --> 51:52.120]  Really? You need medical experiment victims?
[51:52.120 --> 51:54.120]  You need medical experiment victims?
[52:00.120 --> 52:02.120]  It doesn't matter I have the tab of stock
[52:02.120 --> 52:04.120]  In Alfred Kinsey documents
[52:04.120 --> 52:06.120]  Alfred Kinsey had
[52:06.120 --> 52:08.120]  Dungeons where they molested children
[52:08.120 --> 52:10.120]  And the American Psychological Society
[52:10.120 --> 52:12.120]  Has debates on whether it was right or not
[52:12.120 --> 52:14.120]  Well, he was a doctor
[52:14.120 --> 52:16.120]  So this was important research
[52:16.120 --> 52:18.120]  To pay pedophiles
[52:18.120 --> 52:22.120]  To rape little boys
[52:24.120 --> 52:26.120]  And to pay men to rape little girls
[52:26.120 --> 52:28.120]  And to pay women to do it
[52:28.120 --> 52:30.120]  Oh, but it's professional
[52:30.120 --> 52:32.120]  It's like, Joseph Minglow, I'm a doctor
[52:32.120 --> 52:34.120]  In the German military
[52:34.120 --> 52:36.120]  I'm a doctor, I'm a doctor
[52:36.120 --> 52:38.120]  We're electro-shocking these children
[52:38.120 --> 52:40.120]  And doing MK Ultra on them
[52:40.120 --> 52:42.120]  Because, you know, we're trying to create
[52:42.120 --> 52:44.120]  Super soldiers
[52:44.120 --> 52:46.120]  Oh, okay, we'll do that
[52:46.120 --> 52:48.120]  Oh, hey, let's just
[52:48.120 --> 52:50.120]  Tell everybody it's credit to chop their son's balls off
[52:50.120 --> 52:52.120]  Yeah
[52:52.120 --> 52:54.120]  And they just do it out in the open
[52:54.120 --> 52:56.120]  And you go, but it's so evil, it's so ridiculous
[52:56.120 --> 52:58.120]  That's how evil works, you just gotta be out in the open
[53:00.120 --> 53:02.120]  They're not denying any of it
[53:04.120 --> 53:06.120]  And now we learn 30,000 plus people
[53:06.120 --> 53:08.120]  Have been found in the database
[53:08.120 --> 53:10.120]  Where the German government
[53:12.120 --> 53:14.120]  Would deliver Christian's children
[53:14.120 --> 53:16.120]  Because they call Christianity mentally ill in Germany
[53:18.120 --> 53:20.120]  Home school or stuff like that
[53:20.120 --> 53:22.120]  And they would take them to the ideal love
[53:22.120 --> 53:24.120]  Which is sex with an adult, they believe
[53:26.120 --> 53:28.120]  This is DW.com, this is mainstream news
[53:28.120 --> 53:30.120]  And I told you when it broke, three weeks ago
[53:30.120 --> 53:32.120]  I said, you watch, it won't be this one psychiatrist in Berlin
[53:32.120 --> 53:34.120]  This was nationwide
[53:34.120 --> 53:36.120]  Turns out it was nationwide
[53:38.120 --> 53:40.120]  A cult of screwing your children
[53:40.120 --> 53:42.120]  Of raping them
[53:42.120 --> 53:44.120]  Of pimping them out
[53:44.120 --> 53:46.120]  And then turning them into pedophiles
[53:48.120 --> 53:50.120]  I told you back when they were bringing down the Catholic church
[53:50.120 --> 53:52.120]  That this is in all the big institutions
[53:52.120 --> 53:54.120]  That's how they take it over
[53:54.120 --> 53:56.120]  And now you see it's everywhere
[53:58.120 --> 54:00.120]  Because it was already there
[54:00.120 --> 54:02.120]  It's a cult
[54:02.120 --> 54:04.120]  It's a cult
[54:04.120 --> 54:06.120]  It's a cult
[54:06.120 --> 54:08.120]  We don't just kill our children in the womb
[54:08.120 --> 54:10.120]  We kill their spirit, we kill their future
[54:10.120 --> 54:12.120]  We kill their destiny
[54:12.120 --> 54:14.120]  We betray them
[54:14.120 --> 54:16.120]  Oh, but
[54:16.120 --> 54:18.120]  The reality show parents
[54:18.120 --> 54:20.120]  Oh, they're so
[54:20.120 --> 54:22.120]  Oh, he was an Olympic guy
[54:22.120 --> 54:24.120]  Now he chopped his dick off
[54:24.120 --> 54:26.120]  But he didn't even do that, did he?
[54:26.120 --> 54:28.120]  No, he just wanted you to chop your sons off
[54:28.120 --> 54:30.120]  He didn't chop his off, he wanted the money
[54:32.120 --> 54:34.120]  Hope that money keeps your ass warm
[54:34.120 --> 54:36.120]  In hell
[54:36.120 --> 54:38.120]  When you're freezing in the night circle
[54:38.120 --> 54:40.120]  Unbelievable

[55:39.120 --> 55:41.120]  We are continuing prayer, your focus
[55:41.120 --> 55:43.120]  And your support
[55:43.120 --> 56:10.120]  And I want to invite you to join us
[56:10.120 --> 56:13.120]  We're getting in trouble except for Bill Gates, the FDA
[56:13.120 --> 56:16.120]  Shut down his factories that are making fake COVID tests
[56:16.120 --> 56:18.120]  That show everyone is positive
[56:18.120 --> 56:20.120]  And despite that, they're still testing
[56:20.120 --> 56:22.120]  Record numbers of people creating hysteria
[56:22.120 --> 56:24.120]  And saying the numbers spiking
[56:24.120 --> 56:27.120]  And why it will be 200,000 dead by the election
[56:27.120 --> 56:29.120]  And it's all Trump's fault
[56:29.120 --> 56:31.120]  And now, oh, China had 40 cases in one city
[56:31.120 --> 56:33.120]  We've got to lock down again
[56:33.120 --> 56:35.120]  Everything's over
[56:35.120 --> 56:37.120]  This, ladies and gentlemen, is the new order
[56:37.120 --> 56:39.120]  Teaching us to be total prisoners
[56:39.120 --> 56:41.120]  Of COVID hoax
[56:41.120 --> 56:43.120]  We're all permanently enslaved by it
[56:43.120 --> 57:09.120]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show
[57:09.120 --> 57:12.120]  The man that made this amazing music is dead
[57:12.120 --> 57:14.120]  Charlie Daniels just died
[57:14.120 --> 57:26.120]  You know those evil humans that are bad for the earth
[57:26.120 --> 57:28.120]  Look how sick the globalists are
[57:28.120 --> 57:30.120]  Humans are bad for the earth
[57:30.120 --> 57:32.120]  Chop your son's testicles off
[57:32.120 --> 57:34.120]  They're the enemy, folks
[57:34.120 --> 57:36.120]  I mean, if Martians landed running around with ray guns
[57:36.120 --> 57:38.120]  Shooting us, they'd be better than this
[57:38.120 --> 57:40.120]  At least they'd be right there doing it
[57:40.120 --> 57:42.120]  That's not how they attack
[57:42.120 --> 57:46.120]  They attack to the subspace transmission
[57:46.120 --> 57:48.120]  So the media doesn't joke about that anymore
[57:48.120 --> 57:50.120]  They don't even attack me for it anymore
[57:50.120 --> 57:52.120]  Because they all know
[57:52.120 --> 57:54.120]  They're all down on their knees
[57:54.120 --> 57:56.120]  Doing whatever evil they can to get God away from them
[57:56.120 --> 57:58.120]  So they can get the transmission
[57:58.120 --> 58:00.120]  That's why they kill kids and all that
[58:00.120 --> 58:02.120]  You know that most of them don't even really enjoy it
[58:02.120 --> 58:04.120]  They just have got to get
[58:04.120 --> 58:06.120]  That little bubble of Satanism around them
[58:06.120 --> 58:09.120]  So the demons can get their transmission in
[58:09.120 --> 58:11.120]  You know, I knew God was real a long time ago
[58:11.120 --> 58:21.120]  But 20-something years ago, 25, 27, 28 years ago
[58:21.120 --> 58:23.120]  I used to go down to abortion clinics and protest a lot
[58:23.120 --> 58:25.120]  And you'd have the doctor come out
[58:25.120 --> 58:27.120]  Or you'd have one of the nurses come out
[58:27.120 --> 58:29.120]  Or you'd have people going to do it
[58:29.120 --> 58:31.120]  People bringing women to do it
[58:31.120 --> 58:33.120]  And there's a lot of video of this now
[58:33.120 --> 58:35.120]  And I always talk about this
[58:35.120 --> 58:37.120]  But people caught it on tape a lot around the country
[58:37.120 --> 58:39.120]  It's always the same
[58:39.120 --> 58:41.120]  And some woman will walk up
[58:41.120 --> 58:43.120]  And she'll be rubbing her breasts
[58:43.120 --> 58:45.120]  And she'll go, I love Satan, I love killing babies
[58:45.120 --> 58:47.120]  And I'll keep doing it
[58:47.120 --> 58:49.120]  And you're like, wow
[58:49.120 --> 58:51.120]  And you kind of learn like, oh, that's a sex demon
[58:51.120 --> 58:53.120]  Then you got like slimmers
[58:53.120 --> 58:55.120]  And it's all
[58:55.120 --> 58:57.120]  And you just learn how they all are
[58:57.120 --> 58:59.120]  It's like, oh, that's that demon, that's that demon
[58:59.120 --> 59:01.120]  You go to Seattle
[59:01.120 --> 59:03.120]  It's under such demonic control
[59:03.120 --> 59:05.120]  That we've got live streams that caught this
[59:05.120 --> 59:07.120]  Where I'd go around one street in a corner
[59:07.120 --> 59:09.120]  And it's like
[59:09.120 --> 59:11.120]  Agent Smith in The Matrix
[59:11.120 --> 59:13.120]  Where he's coming after Neo and he's jumping
[59:13.120 --> 59:15.120]  Into person after person
[59:15.120 --> 59:17.120]  Just like the Bible says, demons are jumping from person to person to person
[59:17.120 --> 59:19.120]  Because they're already open channels to it
[59:19.120 --> 59:21.120]  So anytime they want in
[59:21.120 --> 59:23.120]  Ah, we're going to get you after your family
[59:23.120 --> 59:25.120]  And I walk around the corner
[59:25.120 --> 59:27.120]  That's right, we're everywhere
[59:27.120 --> 59:29.120]  We're going to get your family
[59:29.120 --> 59:31.120]  So whether it's a demon or not
[59:31.120 --> 59:33.120]  They're also programmed might as well be
[59:33.120 --> 59:35.120]  Because, I mean, they act like demons
[59:37.120 --> 59:39.120]  And then you look at these creatures
[59:39.120 --> 59:41.120]  They act like retarded gremlins
[59:43.120 --> 59:45.120]  Is this an advanced species? No
[59:47.120 --> 59:49.120]  It's just space junk
[59:49.120 --> 59:51.120]  Injected into the planet to destroy us
[59:53.120 --> 59:55.120]  I mean, look at Lord Rothschild
[59:55.120 --> 59:57.120]  Look at Hillary Clinton
[59:57.120 --> 59:59.120]  Does that look like
[59:59.120 --> 1:00:01.120]  Are superior?
[1:00:01.120 --> 1:00:03.120]  And I'm putting down the look
[1:00:03.120 --> 1:00:05.120]  Not the physical body being old
[1:00:05.120 --> 1:00:07.120]  Just the rat likeness
[1:00:07.120 --> 1:00:09.120]  And the weakness
[1:00:09.120 --> 1:00:11.120]  And how scared they look
[1:00:13.120 --> 1:00:15.120]  I mean, both picture Hillary Clinton
[1:00:17.120 --> 1:00:19.120]  She's just like Brian Stelter
[1:00:19.120 --> 1:00:21.120]  She can't even help jack-o-lanterns
[1:00:21.120 --> 1:00:23.120]  What I call it
[1:00:25.120 --> 1:00:27.120]  That's a jack-o-lantern right there
[1:00:27.120 --> 1:00:29.120]  And like I told you
[1:00:29.120 --> 1:00:31.120]  I got sucked into the
[1:00:31.120 --> 1:00:33.120]  Edges of real Satanism
[1:00:33.120 --> 1:00:35.120]  Not, not, not
[1:00:35.120 --> 1:00:37.120]  Not the trailer park version
[1:00:37.120 --> 1:00:39.120]  I mean, the real deal, you know, the helicopter
[1:00:39.120 --> 1:00:41.120]  Pads, the mansions, the whole line arts
[1:00:41.120 --> 1:00:43.120]  And you know what Satanists look like
[1:00:43.120 --> 1:00:45.120]  They look like Hillary Clinton
[1:00:45.120 --> 1:00:47.120]  You go into a room of real Satanists, ladies and gentlemen
[1:00:47.120 --> 1:00:49.120]  They look just like this here
[1:00:49.120 --> 1:00:51.120]  I'll try to make the face without actually tuning into it
[1:00:51.120 --> 1:00:53.120]  Because I don't like to tune into it
[1:00:53.120 --> 1:00:55.120]  I can actually tune into it and show you
[1:00:55.120 --> 1:00:57.120]  I can do a straight shot
[1:00:59.120 --> 1:01:01.120]  That's what Satanists look like
[1:01:01.120 --> 1:01:03.120]  And Hillary
[1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:05.120]  Doesn't
[1:01:05.120 --> 1:01:07.120]  Hillary doesn't
[1:01:07.120 --> 1:01:09.120]  Even hide it, ladies and gentlemen
[1:01:11.120 --> 1:01:13.120]  So
[1:01:15.120 --> 1:01:17.120]  She wants to kill you and your family
[1:01:17.120 --> 1:01:19.120]  Period, she wants to kill you
[1:01:19.120 --> 1:01:21.120]  She wants to kill you
[1:01:21.120 --> 1:01:23.120]  She wants you starving and begging first though
[1:01:23.120 --> 1:01:25.120]  With horrible diseases
[1:01:25.120 --> 1:01:27.120]  Having convulsions
[1:01:27.120 --> 1:01:29.120]  But see, notice, that's what she's cursed to
[1:01:29.120 --> 1:01:31.120]  What she tries to do to us
[1:01:31.120 --> 1:01:33.120]  God is going to literally
[1:01:33.120 --> 1:01:35.120]  Give her exactly
[1:01:35.120 --> 1:01:37.120]  He's going to put her in a prison cell herself
[1:01:37.120 --> 1:01:39.120]  For
[1:01:39.120 --> 1:01:41.120]  Eternity
[1:01:43.120 --> 1:01:45.120]  Until eternity ends
[1:01:45.120 --> 1:01:47.120]  And she crawls back out of that nest again
[1:01:47.120 --> 1:01:53.120]  To try to get our children
[1:02:17.120 --> 1:02:19.120]  19
[1:02:19.120 --> 1:02:21.120]  Is then added into the database
[1:02:21.120 --> 1:02:23.120]  As having a case that is counted as a case of COVID-19
[1:02:23.120 --> 1:02:25.120]  It's in the NIH documents
[1:02:25.120 --> 1:02:27.120]  It's at the state level
[1:02:27.120 --> 1:02:29.120]  We confirmed it in Texas, we're now confirming
[1:02:29.120 --> 1:02:31.120]  It's in other states, this is beyond
[1:02:31.120 --> 1:02:33.120]  The other smoking guns of them
[1:02:33.120 --> 1:02:35.120]  Putting people that died on shot wounds
[1:02:35.120 --> 1:02:37.120]  And stuff in the COVID column
[1:02:37.120 --> 1:02:39.120]  And the false positive test, that's all huge
[1:02:39.120 --> 1:02:41.120]  This is beyond that mega
[1:02:41.120 --> 1:02:43.120]  Criminal activity
[1:02:43.120 --> 1:02:45.120]  And we've got these different county commission videos
[1:02:45.120 --> 1:02:47.120]  Where they're just freaking out over it
[1:02:47.120 --> 1:02:49.120]  Saying what in the world is this
[1:02:49.120 --> 1:02:51.120]  The full video is posted at Band-On Video
[1:02:51.120 --> 1:02:53.120]  Get it out and expose the hoax
[1:02:53.120 --> 1:02:55.120]  Say to the African presidents
[1:02:55.120 --> 1:02:57.120]  Yes sir
[1:02:57.120 --> 1:02:59.120]  Do not take
[1:02:59.120 --> 1:03:01.120]  Their medications
[1:03:01.120 --> 1:03:03.120]  No
[1:03:03.120 --> 1:03:05.120]  No
[1:03:05.120 --> 1:03:07.120]  No
[1:03:07.120 --> 1:03:09.120]  No
[1:03:09.120 --> 1:03:11.120]  No
[1:03:11.120 --> 1:03:13.120]  No
[1:03:13.120 --> 1:03:15.120]  No
[1:03:15.120 --> 1:03:17.120]  No
[1:03:17.120 --> 1:03:19.120]  No
[1:03:19.120 --> 1:03:21.120]  No
[1:03:21.120 --> 1:03:23.120]  No
[1:03:23.120 --> 1:03:25.120]  No
[1:03:25.120 --> 1:03:27.120]  No
[1:03:27.120 --> 1:03:29.120]  No
[1:03:29.120 --> 1:03:31.120]  No
[1:03:31.120 --> 1:03:33.120]  No
[1:03:33.120 --> 1:03:33.120]  No
[1:03:33.120 --> 1:03:35.120]  No
[1:03:35.120 --> 1:03:37.120]  No
[1:03:37.120 --> 1:03:39.120]  No
[1:03:39.120 --> 1:03:41.120]  No
[1:03:41.120 --> 1:03:43.120]  No
[1:03:43.120 --> 1:03:45.120]  No
[1:03:45.120 --> 1:03:47.120]  No
[1:03:47.120 --> 1:03:49.120]  No
[1:03:49.120 --> 1:04:02.640]  need to look at. Not only what they give us, we need to give ourselves something better.
[1:04:02.640 --> 1:04:14.640]  So my teacher told me, don't speak for some, speak for the whole. And now I'm speaking
[1:04:14.640 --> 1:04:24.120]  for Black America, for Hispanic America, for the Native American, and for those who
[1:04:24.120 --> 1:04:33.640]  are desirous of life. They are making money now, plotting to give seven billion, five
[1:04:33.640 --> 1:04:54.160]  hundred million people a vaccination. Dr. Fauci, Bill Gates and Melinda, you want to depopulate
[1:04:54.160 --> 1:05:02.040]  there? What the hell gives you that right? Who are you to sit down with your billions
[1:05:02.040 --> 1:05:10.600]  and talk about who can live and who should die? That's why your world is coming to an
[1:05:10.600 --> 1:05:19.440]  end quickly, because you have sentenced billions to death, but God is now sentencing you to
[1:05:19.440 --> 1:05:26.960]  the death that you are sentencing to others. Well, that's two minutes and six seconds of
[1:05:26.960 --> 1:05:32.000]  pure truth. It's at newswars.com. That's Lewis Farrakhan. And the media takes out a context
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:43.200]  of things he says that I disagree with, because I don't want to make this racial or religious.
[1:05:43.200 --> 1:05:50.960]  But what he says is true. And did you know that that speech was banned off of Fox's so-called
[1:05:50.960 --> 1:05:58.560]  black channel and banned everywhere else? They're not allowing it to be uploaded. In fact, I
[1:05:58.560 --> 1:06:01.480]  went and looked where I originally got it. It's been taken off Twitter. I'm sure other
[1:06:01.480 --> 1:06:08.960]  copies are up there. But Bill Gates says he wants to depopulate you, because he metaphysically
[1:06:08.960 --> 1:06:12.320]  has to admit it in one statement, but like a lawyer later go, oh, I got something for
[1:06:12.320 --> 1:06:17.040]  you. It's good. Oh, and by the way, it's going to hurt a bunch of people. You've got to
[1:06:17.040 --> 1:06:22.640]  get really strong. He has to get his own doctors and his own people ready that, well, there's
[1:06:22.640 --> 1:06:26.560]  a side effect, but it's for the greater good. That's the cover story. But we can't say,
[1:06:26.560 --> 1:06:30.880]  oh, we don't trust you. We don't like you. We know you're a liar. You can't hear that
[1:06:30.880 --> 1:06:43.720]  from the big evil black man, Lewis Farrakhan. Because you need to let Bill Gates kill those
[1:06:43.720 --> 1:06:50.280]  black people. But first he's going to finance them to go around and burn stuff and burn
[1:06:50.280 --> 1:06:53.960]  up their own neighborhoods and make them all look like bad people. First he's going to
[1:06:53.960 --> 1:06:58.760]  frame them up real good and scare the white people. So they won't be like abolitionists
[1:06:58.760 --> 1:07:03.160]  and want to empower people. So they'll actually go at your black people. And it's working
[1:07:03.160 --> 1:07:13.360]  a little bit, but Americans are seeing through it. You know, Christ said what you do the
[1:07:13.360 --> 1:07:19.840]  least of us you've done to me. And it's not the black people, the least of us. People
[1:07:19.840 --> 1:07:26.040]  are all individuals and have different traits and different aspects. But the way it's been
[1:07:26.040 --> 1:07:32.520]  set up is the black people are the least of us. And then we're supposed to take care
[1:07:32.520 --> 1:07:40.240]  of them by chopping their son's balls off. Do you really think that's what God wants
[1:07:40.240 --> 1:07:45.240]  us to do? Do you really think we're not going to be punished for that? Lewis Farrakhan's
[1:07:45.240 --> 1:07:48.920]  absolutely right. You will be punished for everything you do. I will be, you will be,
[1:07:48.920 --> 1:07:52.160]  everybody will be. And racist black people out knocking white people on the head for
[1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:56.360]  no reason. They're idiots. They've been programmed just like the white liberals. When you get
[1:07:56.360 --> 1:08:01.160]  on one of these events, they're a shameful group of people. They look like somebody sucked
[1:08:01.160 --> 1:08:09.920]  their brains out. That's what serving this evil does. Here comes the wolf. Here comes
[1:08:09.920 --> 1:08:15.240]  the weasel on the in-house. He says, I want the vaccines for black people first because
[1:08:15.240 --> 1:08:21.120]  I love you so much. He's telling you right in your face what he's doing. And all these
[1:08:21.120 --> 1:08:25.080]  sick evil black leaders are paid off or not black leaders. They're black assassins to
[1:08:25.080 --> 1:08:30.240]  kill their own people. You think the devil sends in somebody that looks different? No.
[1:08:30.240 --> 1:08:35.160]  The devil, Margaret Sanger, all of them on record said, I've got her letters. They're
[1:08:35.160 --> 1:08:41.200]  in the Colgate Foundation. You can look them up online. I got actual copies for in-game.
[1:08:41.200 --> 1:08:44.320]  When I used to read this stuff online that Margaret Sanger said, we got to hire all the
[1:08:44.320 --> 1:08:48.440]  black leaders and we got to break their families up and we got to sterilize all of them and
[1:08:48.440 --> 1:08:51.920]  we got to do all this to them. I thought, man, that's, that's just incredible. And I
[1:08:51.920 --> 1:08:59.000]  sent off to the university of St. Louis actually had them and I got copies. I paid for copies
[1:08:59.000 --> 1:09:03.600]  of her handwritten letters. She wanted to kill every black person on the planet. And she
[1:09:03.600 --> 1:09:10.240]  got awards from Hitler. She, she trained Hitler and she runs the whole Democratic Party. And
[1:09:10.240 --> 1:09:18.000]  these people, they sit up there with their nerve. I was sitting in an outdoor restaurant
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:24.880]  about three years ago with a few of the crew members and these black guys walked by. There's
[1:09:24.880 --> 1:09:27.640]  little fence, you know, little fence with a restaurant and they go, oh, look, it's the
[1:09:27.640 --> 1:09:32.240]  blue-eyed devil, Alex Jones. I jumped that fence with one arm, got right in their face
[1:09:32.240 --> 1:09:36.680]  and I said, you listen to me and you listen real good, buddy boy. You try to hurt me and
[1:09:36.680 --> 1:09:39.960]  my family is what color I am. I will destroy you. You want to get in the fight right now?
[1:09:39.960 --> 1:09:44.920]  Let's do it. I'm trying to save my ass and to save my ass, I got to save yours. You don't
[1:09:44.920 --> 1:09:49.040]  take their vaccines. You don't buy their crap. You'll listen to their gangster rap, all that.
[1:09:49.040 --> 1:09:53.440]  It's meant to destroy you. So if you want to get your ass kicked right now, I'll do it
[1:09:53.440 --> 1:09:59.160]  to wake you up. And it was literally like the movie they live with Rowdy Piper. It was
[1:09:59.160 --> 1:10:04.320]  that moment. I was ready to kick both those guys' asses, to wake them the hell up, man.
[1:10:04.320 --> 1:10:08.960]  I'd have done it lovingly. I'd have beat the living hell out of both of them. I had the
[1:10:08.960 --> 1:10:15.960]  right on my side right then. There was nothing they could do and they knew it. You take that
[1:10:15.960 --> 1:10:22.600]  racist crap and you shove it up your ass. The devil wants us to kill each other. We've
[1:10:22.600 --> 1:10:33.000]  got to stop doing it. All right, we're going to go break. I'm so sick of the globalists.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:40.040]  I'm so sick of their crap. I can't even look at Bill Gates anymore. Just evil-looking, evil-wives.
[1:10:40.040 --> 1:10:46.280]  God, these people make me sick. And the way they run circles around us, it should be so
[1:10:46.280 --> 1:10:50.920]  obvious that they're trying to sink the ship. It should be so obvious that you should defend
[1:10:50.920 --> 1:10:55.120]  the republic. It should be so obvious you should love Jesus. It should be so obvious
[1:10:55.120 --> 1:11:00.320]  we shouldn't be killing our babies. It should be so obvious, but it's not. And that's how
[1:11:00.320 --> 1:11:04.120]  the devil tricks you. All kill these kids. All kill these black people. That'll end
[1:11:04.120 --> 1:11:12.000]  the problem. And all you've done is killed yourself. The devil is training us to kill
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:17.160]  each other. And we sit here like dumbasses and we go along with it and I personally can't
[1:11:17.160 --> 1:11:22.120]  take it anymore. I'm not going to take it anymore. I declare total war on the world order. I
[1:11:22.120 --> 1:11:27.680]  know you are too. I can feel your spirit is strong. America is rejecting this poison.
[1:11:27.680 --> 1:11:31.440]  The world is rejecting this poison. Let me explain this. Then they'll go, oh, then open
[1:11:31.440 --> 1:11:36.940]  your borders up. You love the brown people. No, no, no. We've got to fix those places
[1:11:36.940 --> 1:11:42.880]  and stabilize them. That's a weapon that they've torn down and weaponized and scrambled up.
[1:11:42.880 --> 1:11:47.520]  This isn't just idiot logic where it's like, oh, we're all kumbaya. The enemy knows we're
[1:11:47.520 --> 1:11:57.000]  like that. They try that and they play that with us. It's a weapon and they're going to
[1:11:57.000 --> 1:12:01.240]  put us in a position where the third world is so dangerous, we're going to cheer and
[1:12:01.240 --> 1:12:04.640]  all wink at each other when they release a bio weapon that's going to kill billions
[1:12:04.640 --> 1:12:14.280]  of brown people. And then I've seen the plans. They're public. I've also studied the enemy
[1:12:14.280 --> 1:12:20.320]  more ways than one and they want us to sign on to exterminating the third world and they
[1:12:20.320 --> 1:12:24.320]  got a lot of excuses and reasons. They're teachings. People are bad. We got to save the spaceship,
[1:12:24.320 --> 1:12:27.120]  blah, blah, blah, but they're the ones that never industrialized it. They're the ones
[1:12:27.120 --> 1:12:30.760]  that promote policies, have as many kids as possible because for them, it's more kids
[1:12:30.760 --> 1:12:35.440]  to kill. And then they're the saviors while they try to, you understand how that works?
[1:12:35.440 --> 1:12:45.240]  These people are sick. All right, when we come back, I'm going to play the report. I told
[1:12:45.240 --> 1:12:52.040]  you about it. I'm going to call it the new July 5th movement we're launching. 2020 is
[1:12:52.040 --> 1:12:57.280]  a very special year to the globalists, to the occultists, to those that are into esoteric
[1:12:57.280 --> 1:13:01.160]  mysticism and they believe this is the year they're going to totally overthrow America
[1:13:01.160 --> 1:13:06.760]  and the world and bring in their anti-God, anti-human tyranny. Well, we're here on air

[1:14:54.360 --> 1:15:23.360]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:15:24.360 --> 1:15:33.520]  We are back, my friends. I'm your host, Alex Jones. Very thankful you're here. Even more
[1:15:33.520 --> 1:15:36.200]  thankful that you share the links, because I don't want to just do this for no reason.
[1:15:36.200 --> 1:15:40.920]  I want to win, and I know you want to win as well. Global Awakening is here. Look at
[1:15:40.920 --> 1:15:45.160]  the headline of the live show today. I forget exactly what I wrote, but it's basically the
[1:15:45.160 --> 1:15:49.360]  Global Awakening is here. The tipping point has been reached. The sleeping giant is rising.
[1:15:49.360 --> 1:15:54.800]  The enemy is going to strike back, so you better get ready. It's just going to be right
[1:15:54.800 --> 1:16:00.840]  out in the open. They're going to say, by the time they're done, sterilize your sons
[1:16:00.840 --> 1:16:08.160]  and your daughters, or you don't get your multi-pass to work. That's the official plan.
[1:16:08.160 --> 1:16:13.040]  Everything these predators is doing is pure, absolute, adulterated evil, and everything
[1:16:13.040 --> 1:16:17.880]  is about getting you to submit to them. I'm going to ask you, are you going to submit
[1:16:17.880 --> 1:16:23.400]  to these people? All right. This gentleman, we can't figure out his name. It's been out
[1:16:23.400 --> 1:16:30.680]  a month. It's got millions of views on Twitter. It's Seymour underscore views. It'll probably
[1:16:30.680 --> 1:16:36.200]  be banned on Instagram. But here's his layout. We don't know his name. He's a black man from
[1:16:36.200 --> 1:16:42.600]  Pennsylvania. But I was going to take a July 4th message. I was going to shoot one at the
[1:16:42.600 --> 1:16:47.320]  house, and I saw this. I'd forgotten about it. I'd only seen part of it previously or
[1:16:47.320 --> 1:16:51.840]  forgot about it. And I said, well, this is my July 4th message. So I want to talk about
[1:16:51.840 --> 1:16:56.800]  the July 5th movement and hit news next segment. But let's go ahead and go to this gentleman.
[1:16:56.800 --> 1:16:57.800]  Here it is.
[1:16:57.800 --> 1:17:03.800]  This is my first YouTube video, first social media video. So I'm not sure if I'm even doing
[1:17:03.800 --> 1:17:08.960]  this right, but here it goes. I just want to say something. Just got into a beef with
[1:17:08.960 --> 1:17:14.920]  my best friend over some political issues. I just wish people wake up and realize that
[1:17:14.920 --> 1:17:20.080]  Trump is not fighting against you. Trump is not fighting against black people. He's not
[1:17:20.080 --> 1:17:24.040]  fighting against Spanish people. He's not fighting against transgender. He's not fighting
[1:17:24.040 --> 1:17:30.600]  against Mexicans or none of that. Trump is fighting against globalists. Globalists don't
[1:17:30.600 --> 1:17:35.560]  have nothing to do with none of us. Globalists. There are people who believe in one world
[1:17:35.560 --> 1:17:40.840]  order, one world agenda, the bankers, the money, the movie makers, they the ones who
[1:17:40.840 --> 1:17:44.920]  hate Trump for a reason because he's not there playing. He's not part of the agenda. Trump
[1:17:44.920 --> 1:17:49.440]  done went over there, got North Korea to put down their guns. He then squashed the beef
[1:17:49.440 --> 1:17:54.880]  with Russia. He then told China to stop playing with us and pay us our money. Went to the
[1:17:54.880 --> 1:17:58.920]  European Union, told them that y'all owe us money. Time to pay up or y'all not going
[1:17:58.920 --> 1:18:07.160]  to get no security. He then cut the corporate tax from 35% to 21%, making us more competitive
[1:18:07.160 --> 1:18:12.960]  in the global market. Black people unemployment rate is at all time low. Women's unemployment
[1:18:12.960 --> 1:18:18.600]  rate all time low. Spanish people unemployment rate all time low. You got jobs coming back
[1:18:18.600 --> 1:18:23.040]  to Pennsylvania. People porn still again in America. They say that we will never have
[1:18:23.040 --> 1:18:29.360]  again and they still try to make this a black and white issue. Now is not the time for angry
[1:18:29.360 --> 1:18:33.800]  black people to stand up. Now is not the time for angry Mexicans to stand up. Now is not
[1:18:33.800 --> 1:18:40.200]  the time for transgenders to stand up. Now is not the time for patriots to stand up.
[1:18:40.200 --> 1:18:44.080]  Patriots who love America. When I find out it's most Mexicans don't like America. They
[1:18:44.080 --> 1:18:48.920]  say America when it's all said and done at the end of the argument. It's time for patriots
[1:18:48.920 --> 1:18:52.480]  to stand up. I understand America got a rough history but a lot of people died for this
[1:18:52.480 --> 1:18:56.320]  country that was black who died for this country too. And you just don't love the country.
[1:18:56.320 --> 1:19:01.240]  Because of somewhere else. Go somewhere else if you don't like America, okay? Because
[1:19:01.240 --> 1:19:06.120]  it ain't about you. I'm black. I don't even know white people. It ain't about me. It's
[1:19:06.120 --> 1:19:12.400]  about America. We've been losing on every thing. On everybody money across the world
[1:19:12.400 --> 1:19:17.040]  but nobody don't owe us. China is stealing all our intellectual properties and setting
[1:19:17.040 --> 1:19:22.280]  to the rest of the world for pennies on the dollar. We losing. This man trying to stand
[1:19:22.280 --> 1:19:27.920]  up for the country. We can fix the rest of it later. First we got to say the ship. The
[1:19:27.920 --> 1:19:32.600]  ship has been sinking. Has been sinking. He's trying to put a bandaid on it. Fix the
[1:19:32.600 --> 1:19:36.560]  mud. Save the country. Then we can fix this racism and all this other shit y'all keep
[1:19:36.560 --> 1:19:43.080]  crying about. It's time for patriots to stand up. I'm a patriot. I love America. I love
[1:19:43.080 --> 1:19:47.720]  the freedom that it gives me here. Yeah we got racism issues but that's not the biggest
[1:19:47.720 --> 1:19:52.040]  issue. People don't understand. Trump supporters is about one thing. America first. That means
[1:19:52.040 --> 1:19:54.760]  we don't want to hear about your racist shit. We don't want to hear about your Mexicans.
[1:19:54.760 --> 1:20:00.320]  We don't want to hear about your trans dinges and none of this. We want to talk about America
[1:20:00.320 --> 1:20:06.040]  first and right now we are winning. We are respected in the world right now. Okay. We're
[1:20:06.040 --> 1:20:10.320]  making money. People know not to play with us. Trump's number one job is commander in
[1:20:10.320 --> 1:20:14.960]  chief of our military. People say oh Trump want to start a war. Where the fuck is the
[1:20:14.960 --> 1:20:21.000]  war? He squashed the beef. You hear me? Squashed the beef. North Korea know don't fuck with
[1:20:21.000 --> 1:20:25.680]  us no more little rocket boy. We will smash your ass. Take real balls to do that. We ain't
[1:20:25.680 --> 1:20:29.960]  playing with these people. And then they try to say he colluded with Russia. Colluded with
[1:20:29.960 --> 1:20:35.240]  Russia for what? For peace. We was about to go with World War III with Hillary and them.
[1:20:35.240 --> 1:20:41.240]  Don't you all remember? Russian moved their air defense to Syria. America moved their
[1:20:41.240 --> 1:20:45.920]  to Syria. The line was drawn in the sand. We were supposed to be gone. Hillary was supposed
[1:20:45.920 --> 1:20:51.400]  to be in the president. We were supposed to set it off. It wasn't their plan for Trump
[1:20:51.400 --> 1:20:58.120]  to win. He may be an asshole, a bigot. It don't make a difference. It was not their
[1:20:58.120 --> 1:21:05.760]  plan for him to win. They had a plan. And now they married this shit. So you got to
[1:21:05.760 --> 1:21:11.320]  hate your mother. Wake up. Patriots stand up. It's not a black or white thing. Stand
[1:21:11.320 --> 1:21:18.480]  up. God bless you. God bless America. God bless Donald Trump. Pied to the people. I
[1:21:18.480 --> 1:21:21.720]  don't give a fuck about none of that race shit right now. We're trying to save America.
[1:21:21.720 --> 1:21:26.560]  America first. Make America great again. Well, we've got his Trump's new vice presidential
[1:21:26.560 --> 1:21:35.280]  candidate. The people are saying have Kanye replaced Pence. I like Kanye. I think Kanye
[1:21:35.280 --> 1:21:38.080]  is a great guy. I don't think I should be the vice president either. I just think we're
[1:21:38.080 --> 1:21:44.440]  both too wild. But getting serious. Why is that such an important video? First video
[1:21:44.440 --> 1:21:49.480]  he's done. He looks it up right here. It's true. And it's just out of the park truth
[1:21:49.480 --> 1:21:56.040]  because it's real. And that's the kind of guy you, you can be old, Hispanic, black,
[1:21:56.040 --> 1:22:00.400]  Asian, wherever you are. You love freedom and you get it. Speak out. You're the secret
[1:22:00.400 --> 1:22:04.040]  weapon. You think Alex Jones is the only one that can run his mouth about freedom and
[1:22:04.040 --> 1:22:10.200]  knock something out of the park? No. And I've always known my main mission is to get other
[1:22:10.200 --> 1:22:16.000]  people who are patriots of every race, color and creed to just get off the bench and come
[1:22:16.000 --> 1:22:21.680]  on in because we're in a big fight. We need you. We need you bad, man. I need you bad.
[1:22:21.680 --> 1:22:25.360]  You need me too, man. I'm just telling you, we need each other. We're getting, we be getting
[1:22:25.360 --> 1:22:29.520]  our asses kicked, man. They're killing our kids or chopping our boys balls off. I mean,
[1:22:29.520 --> 1:22:34.520]  they're promoting world government all the place. Satanism. I mean, we got to start coming
[1:22:34.520 --> 1:22:39.080]  up at some time. We've got to say we've hit bottom. Come on. And I feel like I'm not
[1:22:39.080 --> 1:22:44.360]  just saying this. I metaphysically felt it until I fourth. I think we've turned the corner.
[1:22:44.360 --> 1:22:51.200]  And it's because of people like that, man. You just saw never done a video. He's sitting
[1:22:51.200 --> 1:22:58.360]  there knowing all this stuff, ready to knock it out of the park. And he just got the game.
[1:22:58.360 --> 1:23:02.240]  And I'm not trying to use a black analogy, but it's a good analogy. Like it's like the
[1:23:02.240 --> 1:23:06.080]  Negro leagues in baseball or whatever, then they got the, gotten the regular and took
[1:23:06.080 --> 1:23:11.040]  up. I mean, we need everybody that knows the truth. Whether you're black, white, older,
[1:23:11.040 --> 1:23:15.240]  young, you just get off that bench because there's all these men out there that are of
[1:23:15.240 --> 1:23:20.000]  every color. They all got red blood. And I know who you are. If you decided to get in
[1:23:20.000 --> 1:23:24.800]  form and take action, Alex Jones would be out of a job. Please, please. I've been doing
[1:23:24.800 --> 1:23:29.240]  this 26 years. I don't want to quit, but I'm killing myself just so you know. Listen to
[1:23:29.240 --> 1:23:34.240]  me. I need you. I need you. I need you to be better than I am. I need you. I know you're
[1:23:34.240 --> 1:23:46.760]  there. I know you're there. I need you to stand up. Please. Please do it. I look at all these
[1:23:46.760 --> 1:23:52.000]  men out there and they just sit on their asses. When I thank the listeners of this broadcast,
[1:23:52.000 --> 1:23:56.240]  I'm not patting you on the head. I'm like a person that's been thrown overboard who
[1:23:56.240 --> 1:24:02.360]  finds a life raft to get on or a piece of driftwood. I am clinging to you. So when you

[1:24:15.160 --> 1:24:19.200]  not a science. It's not a plan. It's just the way to do it. It's just common sense.

[1:27:10.280 --> 1:27:24.360]  I hear people talking bad about the way we have to live here in this country. I don't
[1:27:24.360 --> 1:27:29.840]  mind them picking sides and I don't mind them switching sides and standing up for things
[1:27:29.840 --> 1:27:37.240]  they believe in. But when they're running down our country, they're walking on the fighting
[1:27:37.240 --> 1:27:44.240]  side of me. They're running us down, all of us. They're walking on the fighting side
[1:27:44.240 --> 1:27:52.240]  of me. Running down a way of life, our fighting men have fought. He died to keep us alive.
[1:27:52.240 --> 1:27:58.720]  See, I'm not into idol worship. It's not idol worship, the love of flag. It's a symbol
[1:27:58.720 --> 1:28:06.520]  of what we stand for and what we fight for and of all those people that came before us.
[1:28:06.520 --> 1:28:11.120]  That is just to mean the soldiers offered some war. That means the women taking care
[1:28:11.120 --> 1:28:15.120]  of the kids back at home in those factories. That means people putting their boots on every
[1:28:15.120 --> 1:28:31.520]  morning and getting the job done. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Well, they love our milk and honey.
[1:28:31.520 --> 1:28:41.200]  But they preach about some other way of living. When they're running down country man, they're
[1:28:41.200 --> 1:28:47.280]  walking on the fighting side of me. Walking on the fighting side. They're walking on the
[1:28:47.280 --> 1:28:52.960]  fighting side of me. That's a live version of real anger. Running down a way of life,
[1:28:52.960 --> 1:28:58.960]  our fighting men have fought and died. You don't love it, leave it. If you don't love
[1:28:58.960 --> 1:29:07.200]  it, leave it. You know, I saw Kaepernick, which is the perfect example of a fake liberal
[1:29:07.200 --> 1:29:13.440]  black person. He's not even black. He might be Arab. He had two white liberal parents
[1:29:13.440 --> 1:29:19.920]  that adopted him. He's worth like $80 million. He works for a corporation with slave factories
[1:29:19.920 --> 1:29:26.840]  all over the world. Turrent slavery. He likes super bad. And he sits over there and he tells
[1:29:26.840 --> 1:29:33.040]  you how much America sucks. Oh, and remember, it was always about police brutality. It was
[1:29:33.040 --> 1:29:42.000]  always about police brutality. Oh, we're not disrespecting the flag. We take a knee. Oh,
[1:29:42.000 --> 1:29:46.280]  we're not disrespecting America. Oh, no, no, it's about bad police. Now he came out the
[1:29:46.280 --> 1:29:54.040]  statement and said, July 4th is white supremacism. Get rid of it. Well, let me ask you a little
[1:29:54.040 --> 1:30:01.360]  question there, son. If Jesus Christ sat down in Jerusalem or landed wherever he so chooses,
[1:30:01.360 --> 1:30:05.600]  then yeah, okay. He says, this is your new symbol. I'll do that. But what are you going
[1:30:05.600 --> 1:30:12.480]  to replace it with my friend? True that you just do what the big money corporations want.
[1:30:12.480 --> 1:30:20.720]  That's to break this country up. Again, nothing against folks with afros. Afros are cool looking
[1:30:20.720 --> 1:30:26.800]  haircuts on girls. I mean, it's kind of flexing, but, you know, whatever. Afros interesting.
[1:30:26.800 --> 1:30:33.000]  But you didn't have an afro to sign that Nike contract. And I bet it's in the contract.
[1:30:33.000 --> 1:30:36.960]  You got to have a big afro and go, I'm black because as soon as you're not black, that's
[1:30:36.960 --> 1:30:51.360]  why you got that bozo, the clown hair. He's married to his Islamist, his sweetie pie.
[1:30:51.360 --> 1:30:57.400]  Wonder how, why don't you move to Middle East, lady or Somalia? It's so good. Oh, you notice
[1:30:57.400 --> 1:31:02.840]  a white supremacist ran over people this weekend, Friday night. Remember that white supremacist
[1:31:02.840 --> 1:31:08.000]  runs over two women and kills one in Seattle. They come and block the road at night. Emergency
[1:31:08.000 --> 1:31:13.560]  wheels pull up. A guy drives around. He slammed on the brakes. He didn't try to do it. They
[1:31:13.560 --> 1:31:19.000]  start trying to kill him. He drives off to protect himself. And now they're trying to
[1:31:19.000 --> 1:31:27.160]  suppress the bug shots because he's Somali. And there's still articles out saying white
[1:31:27.160 --> 1:31:34.040]  supremacist, Charlottesville 2.0. You're on the highway with the lights off at night.
[1:31:34.040 --> 1:31:40.720]  That's a Darwin award right there. Hey, newsflash. Don't run around the highway at night unless
[1:31:40.720 --> 1:31:49.480]  you like dying. He swerves trying to not hit him. He stops with his flashers on and they
[1:31:49.480 --> 1:31:53.200]  start attacking him. But you can see the black news from the car when they see it's a black
[1:31:53.200 --> 1:32:00.080]  dude, they go, oh. But they still go, get out of the car. We're going to kill your ass.
[1:32:00.080 --> 1:32:08.040]  He drives off. You are playing in the highway. And now the guy that hits you, it's his fault.
[1:32:08.040 --> 1:32:16.680]  But that's God's sick irony. There's a Somali. We love our Somalis. We love our Muslims too.
[1:32:16.680 --> 1:32:23.400]  Oh, they're so good. Oh, they're so sweet. You know, they had like 20 million views on
[1:32:23.400 --> 1:32:32.320]  a. I guess Viacom put that out. They thought, see, I never promised I don't lie. I get it.
[1:32:32.320 --> 1:32:37.600]  She could not lie. But I got up and said, I love how the elite are attacking with memes.
[1:32:37.600 --> 1:32:44.760]  This thing's got like 20 million views. So they just deleted the Bon Iver song. It's
[1:32:44.760 --> 1:32:47.880]  been uploaded again. It has like two million views, three million views, whatever. But the
[1:32:47.880 --> 1:32:52.360]  point is, it's like these old globalists, like, because they don't like to be criticized
[1:32:52.360 --> 1:33:01.400]  because they're so godless. They don't get a joke. So to them, like, oh, criticize Jones.
[1:33:01.400 --> 1:33:04.840]  And then it gets 20 million views. And I go, I love it. I love it. Everybody's, oh, we
[1:33:04.840 --> 1:33:11.920]  love Jones. And they delete the video that has 20 million views. It's always the same.
[1:33:11.920 --> 1:33:16.320]  So that's why we can beat these people. Remember, these are slaves. These globalists are cutouts.
[1:33:16.320 --> 1:33:21.440]  These corporate leaders, all of them, except for a few people like Trump, are literally
[1:33:21.440 --> 1:33:29.560]  put in power for front groups because they're nobodies. They do what they're told. That
[1:33:29.560 --> 1:33:35.640]  cue it up to the beginning. Let's play it right now. But I went on air and they even
[1:33:35.640 --> 1:33:39.360]  had articles that was like the New York Times. They go, Jones likes these and we've seen
[1:33:39.360 --> 1:33:45.800]  it's actually positive. No more memes. Memes made by establishment folks. Because people
[1:33:45.800 --> 1:33:49.560]  get it. They see through it. And they also see how it's all come true. Okay, let's go
[1:33:49.560 --> 1:34:02.400]  ahead. Do we have that cue that ready? Is anybody in the control room? No problem. We
[1:34:02.400 --> 1:34:07.320]  play it next segment. Just all I remember, I'm like a guy in a space capsule. So that's
[1:34:07.320 --> 1:34:10.000]  why I'm always like the crew. Hey, people think they're like in the ear. Tell me what
[1:34:10.000 --> 1:34:14.400]  to say. No, it's the opposite. They won't talk to me. I love them, but they won't talk
[1:34:14.400 --> 1:34:20.000]  to me. It's fine. We'll play it next segment. We love our Somalis. We love our Muslims,
[1:34:20.000 --> 1:34:27.000]  too. Oh, they so good. Oh, they so sweet. But what I'm saying is the victory is getting
[1:34:27.000 --> 1:34:30.880]  average people engaged because you're humble and you think, well, I'm not that important.
[1:34:30.880 --> 1:34:36.480]  I'm just average. No, being average is what's important. You're not one of these fake, human
[1:34:36.480 --> 1:34:45.280] oid creatures. And then you've got Hollywood and Time Warner owned at the time, the group
[1:34:45.280 --> 1:34:50.440]  that put these out, and they literally thought it was hurting me. And instead, all it was
[1:34:50.440 --> 1:34:55.360]  wake up all these teenagers to even make her luster. It was just beautiful. And then as
[1:34:55.360 --> 1:35:00.640]  soon as I talked about how it was positive, they removed them. I mean, imagine being like
[1:35:00.640 --> 1:35:06.080]  90 years old, some of the redstone and would he want to be made fun of in the video? No,
[1:35:06.080 --> 1:35:11.040]  because he's some of the redstone. Why, he's got a $50 billion. I mean, he's been sitting
[1:35:11.040 --> 1:35:20.200]  on top America forever. And, you know, you don't put some of the redstone down. I think
[1:35:20.200 --> 1:35:27.880]  that's why it's so easy to beat them. But you have to stop complying with them and make
[1:35:27.880 --> 1:35:32.240]  them a joke because that, you know, they really don't like humor. They don't like being made
[1:35:32.240 --> 1:35:42.480]  fun of. They can't stand it. And so remember that they're all scum. None of them care about
[1:35:42.480 --> 1:35:46.640]  each other. They're all empty. Their families all hate them. They're all devil worshipers
[1:35:46.640 --> 1:35:52.440]  and they can burn in hell to piss on them. It's like, okay, kill me. Hell, let's go.
[1:35:52.440 --> 1:35:58.480]  You can't beat that. I am a maniac. I am a crazy, crazy enough to fight your ass and
[1:35:58.480 --> 1:36:06.400]  beat you because I don't want to rape children. I would eat enchiladas and drink beer. I don't
[1:36:06.400 --> 1:36:11.040]  want to hurt people and dominate them and have power of people. Because guess what?
[1:36:11.040 --> 1:36:17.040]  I've got the birthright of loving Jesus Christ. I've got the affidavit. I've got the, the,
[1:36:17.040 --> 1:36:26.400]  the deed, baby. I already got it all. And you ain't got nothing. So burning hell. That's
[1:36:26.400 --> 1:36:30.920]  my message on this post July 4th. I told you, I get into the July 5th movement and I will
[1:36:30.920 --> 1:36:34.640]  talk about when I come back. But I just want you to know we've already won folks. Christ
[1:36:34.640 --> 1:36:50.320]  has got to tease the death in hell. You're losing new world order just happened on Tuesday
[1:36:50.320 --> 1:36:54.560]  morning driving into work about to break the big Roger Stone news and the big COVID-19
[1:36:54.560 --> 1:37:00.760]  hoax news. And I met a red light at the corner of Brody and 290 and an old Mercedes pulls
[1:37:00.760 --> 1:37:05.800]  up next to me and a Hispanic man and two white women start flipping me off. And I thought
[1:37:05.800 --> 1:37:10.480]  they recognized who I was. So I rolled down my window and I said, what COVID-19 is a hoax.
[1:37:10.480 --> 1:37:15.760]  And they were going, F you, F you, F you, F you, F you. And I said, is that your IQ?
[1:37:15.760 --> 1:37:20.000]  One finger. So they got put up two fingers. I said, Oh, it's 11. And I was like, do you
[1:37:20.000 --> 1:37:23.840]  know who I am? They're like shaking their heads. They go, where your mask? Where your
[1:37:23.840 --> 1:37:27.240]  mask? And they're pointing at the mask. So I guess Joy Bay Harvest, she says she goes
[1:37:27.240 --> 1:37:31.840]  around and does this with her husband. This is a thing, man. Their cult is going crazy.
[1:37:31.840 --> 1:37:36.360]  Their control freaks, they're attacking language, borders, everything, because they all bet
[1:37:36.360 --> 1:37:40.600]  on leftist garbage that hasn't delivered to them. So they're totally going completely
[1:37:40.600 --> 1:37:44.880]  insane. This is crazy.

[1:40:31.640 --> 1:40:35.160]  there is. So this, this was designed on one of the top guys in the country. He didn't
[1:40:35.160 --> 1:40:38.080]  want his name on it because obviously the political issues, but we had to pay a lot
[1:40:38.080 --> 1:40:41.680]  of money for this formulation just for the design of it. And we believe it is the best,
[1:40:41.680 --> 1:40:45.600]  strongest, but healthiest energy out there. And you're saying that it's made your life

[1:40:52.560 --> 1:41:02.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:41:02.240 --> 1:41:06.760]  The paradigm of absolute control. And that's why we're just out here doing simple things
[1:41:06.760 --> 1:41:10.320]  pointing out that we're meant to be in nature and be natural. And this is where we find
[1:41:10.320 --> 1:41:14.480]  a source that God made to transcend the new world order. And that's why they want to
[1:41:14.480 --> 1:41:15.480]  try to keep us out of it.
[1:41:15.480 --> 1:41:22.480]  I'm angry. I've had enough of these people. There are bones of Christian murderous scum.
[1:41:22.480 --> 1:41:31.480]  There are giant death factors keeping babies alive. They're selling their body parts. What
[1:41:31.480 --> 1:41:38.480]  more do you need to know about these people? I know how to face these scums. They literally
[1:41:38.480 --> 1:41:45.480]  crawl out from under rocks. They have green-looking skin. And they run around screaming, we love
[1:41:45.480 --> 1:41:51.480]  Satan. We want to eat babies. I have them on video.
[1:41:51.480 --> 1:42:04.480]  Here is in the creepy, weird, sick stuff, man. She lives in the same room with that creepy,
[1:42:04.480 --> 1:42:14.480]  weird woman whose mother wears her hood over her head. That woman number one is ugly. Imagine
[1:42:14.480 --> 1:42:23.480]  how bad she smells, man. I'm telling her, and Obama just stink. Obama and Hillary Bush
[1:42:23.480 --> 1:42:39.480]  smell like sulfur. In a roof, a vampire parked in the darkness, a hobbling round coming after
[1:42:39.480 --> 1:42:50.480]  us. My spirit gets close to that evil and I feel it go, ah, ah, ah, ah. We'll start
[1:42:50.480 --> 1:42:57.480]  self-centercraft. We don't even know this and it's self-rising up against the billions
[1:42:57.480 --> 1:43:06.480]  of pointed people of the very worst type and I'm so pissed. We're going to stare at your
[1:43:06.480 --> 1:43:21.480]  daughter at the mall. We're going to stare at your wife, your son. We're going to stare
[1:43:21.480 --> 1:43:30.480]  at you with a book tonight and then the police chief is going to say, we love us, we love
[1:43:30.480 --> 1:43:38.480]  Muslims. Oh, they're so good. Oh, they're so sweet.
[1:43:38.480 --> 1:43:44.480]  I was watching Fox News I worked out this morning. So they thought that hurt us and when they
[1:43:44.480 --> 1:43:48.480]  realized it didn't, it had almost totally positive comments. They removed it. So again,
[1:43:48.480 --> 1:43:54.480]  the enemy doesn't have any soul. And remember, they never want to be made fun of. They can't
[1:43:54.480 --> 1:44:04.480]  understand it. I love it. I'm not a masochist. I'm not into being in pain except I am. That
[1:44:04.480 --> 1:44:09.480]  pain gets me where I want to go and that's the attitude. Who cares what people think
[1:44:09.480 --> 1:44:20.480]  about you? If they're wrong, I mean, they could strip me down. They could put me in front
[1:44:20.480 --> 1:44:24.480]  of a crowd of 5 million people throwing tomatoes at me and pillar. I mean, call me any time
[1:44:24.480 --> 1:44:31.480]  you have a think I care. Damn, what you think about me? If you're wrong, go to hell. And
[1:44:31.480 --> 1:44:35.480]  we have to have that attitude. And I know most of you have that attitude, but you're
[1:44:35.480 --> 1:44:41.480]  humble. You don't want to get in people's face. You got to do it. You got to do it.
[1:44:41.480 --> 1:44:46.480]  Believe me. First time I started 30 years ago, shoot my mouth off at grocery stores and
[1:44:46.480 --> 1:44:51.480]  churches and abortion clinics. I didn't like doing it now. It's like breathing. And my
[1:44:51.480 --> 1:44:58.480]  family is used to it now. They just go grocery stores, gas stations, the mall, church, doctor's
[1:44:58.480 --> 1:45:05.480]  office. You run your leftist mouth on me and you try to hin-peck me in any way. I'm not
[1:45:05.480 --> 1:45:15.480]  bowing down to your crap. You piece of crap. Because it's not them. They're a program.
[1:45:15.480 --> 1:45:20.480]  They're telling you what they were told to say. And so they're all about being followers.
[1:45:20.480 --> 1:45:27.480]  And so you want some negative stimulus? You want some Pavlovian electricity? You're going
[1:45:27.480 --> 1:45:33.480]  to get it. They're followers. So they think pecking at us, messing with us, making us
[1:45:33.480 --> 1:45:40.480]  miserable, ruining our economy, breaking dollars, they think that makes us hate Trump.
[1:45:40.480 --> 1:45:48.480]  Because that's who they are. If somebody says to them, do what I say, I'm going to punch
[1:45:48.480 --> 1:45:53.480]  you in the nose. They say, yes, sir. Somebody tells us, do what I say, I'm going to punch
[1:45:53.480 --> 1:45:58.480]  you in the nose. Go ahead and take your best shot. You're about to get your neck broken.
[1:45:58.480 --> 1:46:03.480]  It's not about being tough, folks. We let them rape our children and devil worship everywhere
[1:46:03.480 --> 1:46:12.480]  because we've stopped being men. Anybody's ever been in a fight? Even with a big, mean,
[1:46:12.480 --> 1:46:16.480]  tough person? Just as soon as the fist starts flowing, how much do you love it? You're not
[1:46:16.480 --> 1:46:21.480]  scared once it's happening? Even your head's going in the concrete. It feels good, doesn't
[1:46:21.480 --> 1:46:26.480]  it? Because you're alive now. That's how God built you. You're not supposed to have robots
[1:46:26.480 --> 1:46:30.480]  in your car. You're not supposed to not be doing anything, watch TV. You're supposed to
[1:46:30.480 --> 1:46:36.480]  be building things, doing things, and putting your body in danger because you're just going
[1:46:36.480 --> 1:46:47.480]  to get another one. Yeah, one even better. And what we do on this plane manifests ourselves
[1:46:47.480 --> 1:46:52.480]  at the next level. It's not like the Hindus think where you go up here, you're a bad guy,
[1:46:52.480 --> 1:46:59.480]  as you come back as a grasshopper or something. No. I've seen the other side. The enemy knows
[1:46:59.480 --> 1:47:05.480]  it. And you've seen the other side as well. And so I'm not going to get all preachy here.
[1:47:05.480 --> 1:47:12.480]  Let me show you the real death toll. Because you know, black on black crime is 23 times.
[1:47:12.480 --> 1:47:21.480]  Last FBI statistic I saw what white on black crime is 23 times. It's 10 to 1 black on white
[1:47:21.480 --> 1:47:25.480]  crime. Because of what has been set up and what has been promoted and what has been done.
[1:47:25.480 --> 1:47:29.480]  Because I'm going to tell you, I don't lionize black people or anybody else. I lionize humanity.
[1:47:29.480 --> 1:47:35.480]  But I wouldn't lose the statistics. Black folks eight years ago weren't doing this.
[1:47:35.480 --> 1:47:40.480]  So black people wanted to be successful. They had themselves on a very short leash to try
[1:47:40.480 --> 1:47:45.480]  to get out of where they were. That which doesn't kill you only makes you stronger. They were
[1:47:45.480 --> 1:47:49.480]  becoming strong. The left didn't like that. The globalists didn't like that. They wrote
[1:47:49.480 --> 1:47:54.480]  that. Not defending the system they were under. They would, hey, this system of raw oppression
[1:47:54.480 --> 1:48:01.480]  has made these people tough. They've got solidarity. They're not bowing to us. They're
[1:48:01.480 --> 1:48:08.480]  building strong colleges and families. We've got to take them over. And so the social
[1:48:08.480 --> 1:48:14.480]  engineers came up with a great society you've seen. And now hundreds of black people kill
[1:48:14.480 --> 1:48:21.480]  each other every day. Dozens in Chicago. Dozens in Atlanta. Dozens in Dallas. When I was a
[1:48:21.480 --> 1:48:27.480]  kid in Dallas, it was just black people just slaughtering each other everywhere. And let
[1:48:27.480 --> 1:48:33.480]  me tell you, you'd be in a store or something and be with black people. Young black guys
[1:48:33.480 --> 1:48:36.480]  that came in, the black people were like getting on the counter, getting their gun ready. Because
[1:48:36.480 --> 1:48:41.480]  that was the culture that the system sold and the scythe they ran. It wasn't systemic
[1:48:41.480 --> 1:48:50.480]  racism. It was not wanting to die. And that's what this country and this world's turned
[1:48:50.480 --> 1:48:54.480]  into. So look at all these videos I have right here. There's a whole bunch of them. Black
[1:48:54.480 --> 1:49:01.480]  pastor, all the killing ain't coming from white people. And we've got fathers and mother,
[1:49:01.480 --> 1:49:05.480]  people speaking out about their children being shot. I mean, people come to these block parties
[1:49:05.480 --> 1:49:09.480]  and the thug that wants to kill some of their gang member doesn't go up and do it right in
[1:49:09.480 --> 1:49:12.480]  the head. They always do it like a hundred feet away and just shoot some innocent people.
[1:49:12.480 --> 1:49:16.480]  Now here's a little newsflash. You got to kill somebody. Go kill the person you're trying
[1:49:16.480 --> 1:49:19.480]  to kill. Don't shoot some average people. Oh, but nobody's going to talk about these
[1:49:19.480 --> 1:49:23.480]  little dead kids because they're black on black. The imagine of white dudes went and
[1:49:23.480 --> 1:49:34.480]  sprayed a black crowd. This is sick. Here it is. And then there's the problem of death.
[1:49:34.480 --> 1:49:40.480]  If we're going, if we're going to argue logically, the argument got to hold up on both
[1:49:40.480 --> 1:49:53.480]  sides. All the killing in our community ain't coming from white people. Come on, say amen
[1:49:53.480 --> 1:50:01.480]  if you can. We are killing one another. Our old people are scared to get out at night
[1:50:01.480 --> 1:50:06.480]  in their own community. They're not scared of white people. They scared of young black
[1:50:06.480 --> 1:50:18.480]  boys on the street. It's all because there was no fire in their ass. No, no, no, no, no.
[1:50:18.480 --> 1:50:25.480]  All the killing that's going on ain't going on in River Oaks. It's going on in South
[1:50:25.480 --> 1:50:33.480]  America in third war on Cullen and Martin Luther King. Every street that's named after
[1:50:33.480 --> 1:50:40.480]  Martin Luther King across America is riddled with crime and death in the name of a man
[1:50:40.480 --> 1:50:49.480]  who stood for nonviolent. The church has got to accept some responsibility because we
[1:50:49.480 --> 1:50:53.480]  ain't here singing and shouting on Sunday morning. Let's get out here and go tell that
[1:50:53.480 --> 1:50:59.480]  young black boy and that young black girl. We're going to teach you how to love yourself
[1:50:59.480 --> 1:51:07.480]  more than somebody taught you how to hate yourself. Pull your pants up. Take your nasty
[1:51:07.480 --> 1:51:16.480]  pajamas off when you get up in the morning to go outside. Act like you got good sense.
[1:51:16.480 --> 1:51:23.480]  Talk like somebody's raising you.
[1:51:23.480 --> 1:51:28.480]  All right. The full clips on info wars.com. That's Reverend Terry Anderson Houston. And
[1:51:28.480 --> 1:51:35.480]  it's true. I mean, we need fathers in the house to teach young men that there are repercussions.
[1:51:35.480 --> 1:51:38.480]  That's the problem.
[1:51:38.480 --> 1:51:43.480]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs

[1:53:36.480 --> 1:54:02.480]  your support. Again, I salute you all.
[1:54:02.480 --> 1:54:07.480]  Thomas Jefferson. Well, Dr. Wakefield is going to be joining us. Talk about somebody vindicated.
[1:54:07.480 --> 1:54:13.480]  Very sadly though, there's no pleasure in that because the death toll and those may just
[1:54:13.480 --> 1:54:18.480]  keep skyrocketing. But since he's been on with us a few years ago, a lot has come out. We'll
[1:54:18.480 --> 1:54:25.480]  talk about it next segment. The UN has admitted everything he said was true. But now they've
[1:54:25.480 --> 1:54:32.480]  doubled down. That's coming up. You know, I'm just looking at numbers here, ladies and
[1:54:32.480 --> 1:54:36.480]  gentlemen. And racism is just another form of classism for people to feel like they've
[1:54:36.480 --> 1:54:40.480]  had success. There's other people quote haven't, but usually the people that are involved in
[1:54:40.480 --> 1:54:47.480]  classism and racism themselves didn't earn or build what they did. And when you look at
[1:54:47.480 --> 1:54:51.480]  the Democrats and the globalist, their model, it's simple. You got a big planet. Some areas
[1:54:51.480 --> 1:54:55.480]  are overpopulated. There's a lot of problems. And they play us off against each other. It's
[1:54:55.480 --> 1:55:00.480]  simple divide and conquer. And that's that's how empires have controlled things since the
[1:55:00.480 --> 1:55:05.480]  days of Rome. But I sit here with the July 4th that just passed when I talked about the
[1:55:05.480 --> 1:55:09.480]  July 5th movement. And I said I'd break it down for you, but I really can't do it justice
[1:55:09.480 --> 1:55:14.480]  in the time we have. I really want to build a big website. I want to get the public involved.
[1:55:14.480 --> 1:55:18.480]  I want to try to just say it's an idea I have and see it catch on with other people. In
[1:55:18.480 --> 1:55:23.480]  fact, quite frankly, I had this idea on July 5th in the morning. It was one of those things
[1:55:23.480 --> 1:55:27.480]  that hits me like the big Thunderbolt. And when I had those top deals, it's like, it's
[1:55:27.480 --> 1:55:33.480]  like when I'm like 1997, and I had that if or impoverished that name and information war
[1:55:33.480 --> 1:55:38.480]  and no one has used that name was like, I just saw where it was going. So I'm some psychic
[1:55:38.480 --> 1:55:43.480]  thing. It's a cultural, you know, mathematical analysis and integration of the information.
[1:55:43.480 --> 1:55:52.480]  Well, when I thought of the July 5th movement Sunday morning, it hit me like a Thunderbolt.
[1:55:52.480 --> 1:55:57.480]  Because we talk about July 4th and we have a hot dog and watch some fireworks, but why is it
[1:55:57.480 --> 1:56:02.480]  under attack? Why is the system want to get rid of it? Because it's the flower of the
[1:56:02.480 --> 1:56:08.480]  tail end of the Renaissance of the Gutenberg Press and the freedom of religion and of the
[1:56:08.480 --> 1:56:13.480]  Magna Carta. And I gave a speech outside Bilderberg to a crowd of like 5,000 people many years
[1:56:13.480 --> 1:56:18.480]  ago and even had the police going with me, right, told the history of how Magna Carta
[1:56:18.480 --> 1:56:22.480]  and then all the rest of it came out of England. And that's why we won that war because at
[1:56:22.480 --> 1:56:26.480]  first Parliament would even declare war until the King of England went and demanded you go to
[1:56:26.480 --> 1:56:34.480]  war with your fellow Englishman who had the same rights. So when I talk about 1776 worldwide,
[1:56:34.480 --> 1:56:38.480]  I don't mean just America, folks. I love America. I mean the idea of the Magna Carta,
[1:56:38.480 --> 1:56:45.480]  1215, the idea of the West, the idea of building up humanity and the fact that they blame the
[1:56:45.480 --> 1:56:51.480]  West and Europe particularly for slavery. When anyone that knows any history knows it was
[1:56:51.480 --> 1:57:00.480]  England fought more than 11 wars to end slavery and that the world owes England and hundreds
[1:57:00.480 --> 1:57:05.480]  of thousands of dead sailors, mainly in Marines, who went out and enforced that worldwide and
[1:57:05.480 --> 1:57:14.480]  shut it off. That's why it's such a sick joke to talk about the West, the West extinguished
[1:57:14.480 --> 1:57:21.480]  slavery. And this isn't some big thing we're proud of. It's a reality. And so when you see
[1:57:21.480 --> 1:57:27.480]  that level of ignorance, Frederick Douglass' own statue in New York City, incredible orator.
[1:57:27.480 --> 1:57:31.480]  I read his speeches, I'm like, how can somebody write stuff this good? He's right up there
[1:57:31.480 --> 1:57:39.480]  with Thomas Jefferson. They tore his statue down, just like they're tearing down the Lincoln
[1:57:39.480 --> 1:57:47.480]  statues because it's about power, ladies and gentlemen. It's about the power to have an
[1:57:47.480 --> 1:57:53.480]  ignorant mob come burn your house down and have a bunch of trigly puffs like that lady
[1:57:53.480 --> 1:57:59.480]  right there, dominate and control. That's all this is a bunch of big banks and the chai
[1:57:59.480 --> 1:58:03.480]  comms thinking they could savage this country and savage Europe so they can make us back
[1:58:03.480 --> 1:58:08.480]  down because we're afraid because they use our plurality and open society to then weaponize
[1:58:08.480 --> 1:58:12.480]  our own strength against us. But I believe this will be their undoing and I could see
[1:58:12.480 --> 1:58:18.480]  up the streets and I could feel it. All right. We come back. We're going to go into the
[1:58:18.480 --> 1:58:29.480]  new film 1986 with Dr. Andrew J. Wakefield. On the other side, I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com,
[1:58:29.480 --> 1:58:35.480]  newswars.com, our sights, man died video. We'll be back. Remember, this is your broadcast.
[1:58:35.480 --> 1:58:52.480]  We're only here because of you. You keep us in a pack formation. We are here and despite
[1:58:52.480 --> 1:58:57.480]  all the globalist attacks, you, the viewers and listeners of this transmission have supported
[1:58:57.480 --> 1:59:02.480]  us by prayer, by word of mouth and by buying the products and you have done all of this.
[1:59:02.480 --> 1:59:08.480]  So when you look at the huge effect infowars has had, I want you to understand that it's
[1:59:08.480 --> 1:59:16.480]  because of what you have done and myself and the whole crew salute you on this July 4th,
[1:59:16.480 --> 1:59:21.480]  2020. We've got a lot of our best selling products that were sold out, DNA Force Plus,
[1:59:21.480 --> 1:59:27.480]  bodies, Ultra 12 and others that have been sold out for months back in stock 50% off
[1:59:27.480 --> 1:59:32.480]  for the 4th of July. We're running a special one. I encourage you to get these products
[1:59:32.480 --> 1:59:37.480]  because they have enriched my life so much. I know they'll enrich your life and regardless,
[1:59:37.480 --> 1:59:42.480]  it's a total 360 win because it funds the info war. The only way we fail is when you
[1:59:42.480 --> 1:59:46.480]  don't take action. I don't need to tell you that. You already took action and I salute
[1:59:46.480 --> 2:00:03.480]  you.
[2:00:03.480 --> 2:00:18.480]  Coming to you from deep in the heart of Texas, I'm Alan Jones, your host. Coming up, I'll
[2:00:18.480 --> 2:00:25.480]  play the clip. Remember what Bill Gates said just a few months ago on national TV. He said,
[2:00:25.480 --> 2:00:33.480]  but I thought saving effective never any adverse reactions, never any problems. The heart of
[2:00:33.480 --> 2:00:43.480]  this I've always believed is the 1986 act where they get liability protection for vaccines
[2:00:43.480 --> 2:00:54.480]  and Bill Gates said that the same sentence. He said, we need global indemnification.
[2:00:54.480 --> 2:01:02.480]  That's a license to kill. Order 007, the fictitious character of Ian Fleming. This is a real license
[2:01:02.480 --> 2:01:09.480]  to kill. So I've been demonized. I've been lied about. I've been, and I'm not a victim.
[2:01:09.480 --> 2:01:14.480]  I just want you to know, obviously, when you see Sandy Hook out of context obsessing, they'll
[2:01:14.480 --> 2:01:19.480]  just brand you with some fake thing they talk about, with some fake statement out of context
[2:01:19.480 --> 2:01:24.480]  you didn't make. Oh, you mean Andrew Wakefield, the disgrace guy that admits he faked his
[2:01:24.480 --> 2:01:30.480]  research. And I've been on radio shows and I've said, I'll give you $10,000. I've been
[2:01:30.480 --> 2:01:35.480]  on shows in New York, D.C., Austin. And like an hour later, I'm on here going, where's,
[2:01:35.480 --> 2:01:40.480]  I'm seriously, $10,000 right now. Show me where Andrew Wakefield said it was a lie.
[2:01:40.480 --> 2:01:47.480]  Turns out his research is groundbreaking and now been confirmed all over the world about
[2:01:47.480 --> 2:01:53.480]  gut flora and the rest of it. So yeah, the other people too that said the world was
[2:01:53.480 --> 2:01:57.480]  went on to them, we orbited the sun, you know, they got arrested. So he didn't go, he didn't
[2:01:57.480 --> 2:02:02.480]  get in much trouble as Galileo or anybody, but he did expose this. So Dr. and D.J. Wakefield,
[2:02:02.480 --> 2:02:08.480]  the new film is the 1986, the act, just one nine eight six the act.com one nine eight
[2:02:08.480 --> 2:02:11.480]  six the act.com. They're trying to block it. They're trying to ban it. They're trying to
[2:02:11.480 --> 2:02:16.480]  censor. They've been doing it. And all he does is show you that they're indemnified from
[2:02:16.480 --> 2:02:20.480]  the damage here. Here's the trailer to the film and then we'll come back with Dr.
[2:02:20.480 --> 2:02:21.480]  Wakefield. Here it is.
[2:02:27.480 --> 2:02:33.480]  How do we navigate this increasingly precarious world in which we live? In order to understand
[2:02:33.480 --> 2:02:38.480]  where we're going, we need to understand where we've come from. In order to understand where
[2:02:38.480 --> 2:02:45.480]  we've come from, you need to watch 1980 60 act. It is the story of one of the most powerful
[2:02:45.480 --> 2:02:55.480]  forces in the universe. And that is maternal intuition. Okay, okay. No, no. This is not
[2:02:55.480 --> 2:03:02.480]  halftime entertainment when we've got work to do. This is a force that has evolved in
[2:03:02.480 --> 2:03:10.480]  our species over thousands and thousands of years. It is far more powerful than anything
[2:03:10.480 --> 2:03:17.480]  else that man might have contrived. It is the reason that we are here on this planet
[2:03:17.480 --> 2:03:25.480]  right now. And if we listen to it, it will be the reason why we are here in 1000 years
[2:03:25.480 --> 2:03:26.480]  time.
[2:03:28.480 --> 2:03:32.480]  All right, to talk about where the film is available, what's happening, the censorship.
[2:03:32.480 --> 2:03:38.480]  I know it's massive. Dr. Andy J. Wakefield, we played a song last Friday, Renegades.
[2:03:38.480 --> 2:03:42.480]  Those are my heroes, especially Renegades that are good people and tell the truth they're
[2:03:42.480 --> 2:03:46.480]  proven right and have gone through the fire and been through the media houses. Dr. Wakefield,
[2:03:46.480 --> 2:03:50.480]  I don't usually build up a guest for 10 minutes, but I are five minutes, but I got to tell
[2:03:50.480 --> 2:03:53.480]  you, I really salute you and your courage, sir.
[2:03:53.480 --> 2:03:56.480]  Thank you, Alex. It's great to be back on the show. Thank you.
[2:03:56.480 --> 2:04:01.480]  Where do you want to start the censorship, the filming, the UN coming out last December
[2:04:01.480 --> 2:04:05.480]  admitting vaccines or killing people and there's a cover up. I mean, it's just crazy.
[2:04:05.480 --> 2:04:09.480]  When we start starting with the film and then go from there.
[2:04:09.480 --> 2:04:12.480]  So tell us about 1986, the act.
[2:04:12.480 --> 2:04:22.480]  But this is really a story, Alex, about how bad vaccine policy about unsafe vaccines hurts
[2:04:22.480 --> 2:04:29.480]  children everywhere. And it comes about. I believe that the National Childhood Vaccine
[2:04:29.480 --> 2:04:35.480]  Injury Act in 1986 signed into law by Ronald Reagan is at the core of the vaccine related
[2:04:35.480 --> 2:04:40.480]  problems that we have worldwide right now. And believe me, we have some major problems.
[2:04:40.480 --> 2:04:48.480]  I don't need to tell you that. But this is a law that gave protection from indemnity to
[2:04:48.480 --> 2:04:55.480]  the pharmaceutical industry. What it did is remove the vaccine makers and their products
[2:04:55.480 --> 2:05:01.480]  from the free market, the constraints of the free market. And within the free market,
[2:05:01.480 --> 2:05:05.480]  you know full well that good products will float to the top and will succeed.
[2:05:05.480 --> 2:05:11.480]  And the companies will thrive and bad products will sink down and companies will either
[2:05:11.480 --> 2:05:18.480]  improve or they will fail. They will disappear. But when you take away liability protection
[2:05:18.480 --> 2:05:24.480]  and all incentive for safety studies, then what you do is you allow those unsafe,
[2:05:24.480 --> 2:05:29.480]  those bad, those dangerous products to prevail to succeed in the marketplace.
[2:05:29.480 --> 2:05:35.480]  And then when you make that product mandatory as we have here in the United States, so you
[2:05:35.480 --> 2:05:42.480]  have a mandated market, no liability. What you give the vaccine manufacturers is the perfect
[2:05:42.480 --> 2:05:47.480]  business model. All they can do is profit. And that is exactly what they've done to the
[2:05:47.480 --> 2:05:52.480]  point where they have become extraordinarily powerful, where they've been able to influence
[2:05:52.480 --> 2:05:57.480]  policy, politicians, media, doctors worldwide.
[2:05:57.480 --> 2:06:03.480]  There's no way to overstate this. I mean they're given absolute godlike power. They're indemnified.
[2:06:03.480 --> 2:06:07.480]  They're given total liability protection and there's a bunch of creepy, weird depopulation
[2:06:07.480 --> 2:06:12.480]  eugenicists involved in it. The government wanting to put something in our body and then
[2:06:12.480 --> 2:06:16.480]  the media lying and saying no one's getting hurt when it's on record, they're secretly
[2:06:16.480 --> 2:06:21.480]  paying out billions. I mean this is just, this is a science fiction nightmare.
[2:06:21.480 --> 2:06:27.480]  Yeah, we have a compensation system in place now that has paid out over four billion dollars
[2:06:27.480 --> 2:06:34.480]  in damages. For what? Damages that don't occur? Oh yes they do. And that is a tiny proportion,
[2:06:34.480 --> 2:06:40.480]  a tiny proportion of the true number of children whose lives have been permanently damaged.
[2:06:40.480 --> 2:06:44.480]  And your film likes this out. When can we see it? How do we get it? I've seen there's been
[2:06:44.480 --> 2:06:45.480]  some censorship.
[2:06:45.480 --> 2:06:51.480]  Well, that's happening and as you know with Vax, my last movie when that came out and
[2:06:51.480 --> 2:06:56.480]  it was censored at Tribeca, the nearer went on television the following week and said
[2:06:56.480 --> 2:07:01.480]  we made a mistake. Everybody should see this film, make up their own mind. It exploded worldwide.
[2:07:01.480 --> 2:07:06.480]  So we're trying to actually encourage a bit of censorship, Alex, to give us a bit of free
[2:07:06.480 --> 2:07:14.480]  publicity. So far, it's actually not been too bad. We're surprisingly still on Facebook
[2:07:14.480 --> 2:07:18.480]  and Twitter and all of these things. I cannot imagine that.
[2:07:18.480 --> 2:07:21.480]  Sure, I'd already just seen Blurred people sharing it or being blocked and stuff like that,
[2:07:21.480 --> 2:07:24.480]  but that's good news. I think they've learned and you're saying after trying to block the
[2:07:24.480 --> 2:07:28.480]  last big film that that didn't work too well with the TriXan effect.
[2:07:28.480 --> 2:07:34.480]  Oh, Vax was a hugely successful film. It went everywhere, it went round the world and every
[2:07:34.480 --> 2:07:40.480]  time they tried to censor it. I tell you one story, Alex, we went to Italy and a senator
[2:07:40.480 --> 2:07:47.480]  invited us to show the movie in the Roman Senate and we went there and we were banned.
[2:07:47.480 --> 2:07:52.480]  The first day I arrived in Italy, they cancelled the screening in front of all of the senators
[2:07:52.480 --> 2:07:57.480]  and what happened was, if we played, maybe the senators would have seen it, it made no
[2:07:57.480 --> 2:08:03.480]  media at all. But because they banned it, because for the first time in Italian history, a senator
[2:08:03.480 --> 2:08:08.480]  had been censored from his own Senate. It was on the front page of every newspaper.
[2:08:08.480 --> 2:08:13.480]  It was on every news broadcast for the next three quarters.
[2:08:13.480 --> 2:08:18.480]  Why doesn't the vaccine cartel get that? Because they do the dumbest moves.
[2:08:18.480 --> 2:08:23.480]  I don't want them to get it, not quite yet, not till this movie is a success. So let's just...
[2:08:23.480 --> 2:08:28.480]  No, I agree. Then tell them, you will not censor my film.
[2:08:28.480 --> 2:08:32.480]  Yeah, you won't censor my film and what you won't do is stop people from watching what
[2:08:32.480 --> 2:08:36.480]  they want to watch. If they feel it's relevant and they want to watch it, they will find a
[2:08:36.480 --> 2:08:39.480]  way of watching it. You will not stop them.
[2:08:39.480 --> 2:08:42.480]  By the way, you've gone through hell. I've known you probably 15 years or so, you've been
[2:08:42.480 --> 2:08:45.480]  at many times in the studio and I could see you were a little depressed and down, but
[2:08:45.480 --> 2:08:48.480]  you kept fighting. You seem more effervescent in the videos I see of you now.
[2:08:48.480 --> 2:08:52.480]  I mean, what's this whole war been like for you personally?
[2:08:52.480 --> 2:08:57.480]  You know, Alex, it's been... I guess what happened in the early years is they didn't
[2:08:57.480 --> 2:09:02.480]  like the work I was doing and that's too bad because, as you say, it's now been proven
[2:09:02.480 --> 2:09:09.480]  correct and I say that without being egotistic. It's simply a fact of life.
[2:09:09.480 --> 2:09:13.480]  In the published literature now, the whole gut brain link, the vaccine relationship, it
[2:09:13.480 --> 2:09:17.480]  was so compelling, the vaccine relationship that the CDC had to fake the data.
[2:09:17.480 --> 2:09:20.480]  Stay there. We've got to come back, but I mean, we're not kissing your ass. It's true.
[2:09:20.480 --> 2:09:24.480]  You're a pioneer. I want to ask how with your clinic and how... How did you pioneer this?
[2:09:24.480 --> 2:09:27.480]  You must have scared... This is probably 20 years ago now. You must have scared the hell
[2:09:27.480 --> 2:09:31.480]  out of them. The fact that you literally cut right to what they were doing.
[2:09:31.480 --> 2:09:35.480]  Randy Wakefield's our guest. You've got to find out about the film, promote it.
[2:09:35.480 --> 2:09:39.480]  1986, theact.com. I can't wait to see it. Hopefully we'll get some and carry it as well.
[2:09:39.480 --> 2:09:42.480]  But because with a digital system, they can delete stuff. Now you want to have physical
[2:09:42.480 --> 2:09:45.480]  copies of all this, folks. We're going to save children's lives, save their destinies.
[2:09:45.480 --> 2:09:50.480]  Sisters are saying what I was privately saying of the crew last night.
[2:09:50.480 --> 2:09:54.480]  We may have just broken not just the biggest story in Info Wars history, but one of the
[2:09:54.480 --> 2:10:01.480]  biggest stories, period. The state of Texas confirms that the CDC and NIH have created
[2:10:01.480 --> 2:10:08.480]  a system where anyone that has a sore throat or a runny nose, or who has been in contact
[2:10:08.480 --> 2:10:14.480]  with someone COVID-19, is then added into the database as having a case and is counted
[2:10:14.480 --> 2:10:19.480]  as a case of COVID-19. It's in the NIH documents. It's at the state level. We confirmed it in
[2:10:19.480 --> 2:10:24.480]  Texas. We're not confirming. It's in other states. This is beyond the other smoking guns
[2:10:24.480 --> 2:10:28.480]  of them putting people with a shotgun shot wounds and stuff in the COVID column and the
[2:10:28.480 --> 2:10:35.480]  false positive test. That's all huge. This is beyond that mega criminal activity. And
[2:10:35.480 --> 2:10:39.480]  we've got these Evertonne Commission videos where they're just freaking out over it saying
[2:10:39.480 --> 2:10:43.480]  what in the world is this? The full video is posted at Band-Aid video. Get it out and
[2:10:43.480 --> 2:10:54.480]  expose the hoax.
[2:10:54.480 --> 2:10:57.480]  Where the hell did this water come from?
[2:10:57.480 --> 2:11:02.480]  Where did it come from? Where did it come from? Where did it come from? Where did it come from?

[2:12:10.480 --> 2:12:14.480]  Alex Jones here back live. Dr. Andy J. Wakefield is here.
[2:12:14.480 --> 2:12:27.480]  He's a great guy that pioneered and made major discoveries that are all confirmed now.
[2:12:27.480 --> 2:12:30.480]  I look at news every day. It's ridiculous how much he pioneered. I don't know how he
[2:12:30.480 --> 2:12:35.480]  knew that. And then I know what he went through and how he didn't give up and how he's been
[2:12:35.480 --> 2:12:40.480]  vindicated 15, 20 years later. It's what's happened with me. I haven't gotten to the level
[2:12:40.480 --> 2:12:44.480]  yet of his vindication, but how they've set me up, how they frame me. It gives me faith
[2:12:44.480 --> 2:12:50.480]  in humanity to watch someone doggedly not giving in. It's a real human story.
[2:12:50.480 --> 2:12:53.480]  But we need to talk about the children that are dying and the big rollout and the forced
[2:12:53.480 --> 2:12:58.480]  inoculation coming next segment. But let's go over the history first, the film, the 1986
[2:12:58.480 --> 2:13:01.480]  Act. I think Reagan was a good guy, but he was a little bit senile and he just believed
[2:13:01.480 --> 2:13:05.480]  doctors, so they got it passed. It's a horrible thing Ronald Reagan did. We need to expose
[2:13:05.480 --> 2:13:10.480]  the heart of this as you were saying. So wherever you want to go now on what's currently
[2:13:10.480 --> 2:13:15.480]  happening, what's coming up, the other film, Dr. Wakefield, please continue.
[2:13:15.480 --> 2:13:21.480]  Alex, thank you very much. You know, I talked to you about the taking away liability for
[2:13:21.480 --> 2:13:26.480]  vaccines from the manufacturers for damage done, and then mandating these products so
[2:13:26.480 --> 2:13:30.480]  that they had a captive market. But it got worse, Alex. What happened then is the federal
[2:13:30.480 --> 2:13:36.480]  agencies that were responsible for enacting the policies of Congress by doing adequate
[2:13:36.480 --> 2:13:42.480]  safety studies, vaccine safety studies, monitoring the true rate of adverse reactions to vaccine,
[2:13:42.480 --> 2:13:49.480]  they deliberately in concert with the industry sabotage those checks and balances that
[2:13:49.480 --> 2:13:54.480]  Congress have put in place to protect children. They deliberately sabotage them because
[2:13:54.480 --> 2:14:00.480]  every time a child was compensated, what it said to the public is vaccines can do that.
[2:14:00.480 --> 2:14:05.480]  They didn't want that to believe. They didn't want anyone to believe that vaccines can do
[2:14:05.480 --> 2:14:12.480]  that. And so we have this absolutely catastrophic situation, which is where we are now, where
[2:14:12.480 --> 2:14:20.480]  we have a huge number, 72 doses of vaccines on the schedule before a child leaves high
[2:14:20.480 --> 2:14:26.480]  school. And this is way, way more than you and I would ever have received way back in
[2:14:26.480 --> 2:14:31.480]  the day. And yet we're still here. We're fighting for it. So what has happened? Why is this
[2:14:31.480 --> 2:14:38.480]  necessary? It became they expanded the program dramatically when they were given a get out
[2:14:38.480 --> 2:14:43.480]  of jail free card. When they had no liability, they thought, right, let's just go for it.
[2:14:43.480 --> 2:14:49.480]  And that is exactly what they did with no incentive for safety whatsoever. And then they
[2:14:49.480 --> 2:14:56.480]  bought the agencies. They bought the agencies, they paid for this, the FDA, they paid for
[2:14:56.480 --> 2:15:01.480]  the politicians, and they paid for the media and the doctors, they own them, they became
[2:15:01.480 --> 2:15:07.480]  so rich. And this is globally, this isn't just in America, the vaccine industry became
[2:15:07.480 --> 2:15:13.480]  so wealthy that they could buy all of it. And then of course, what we also had was this,
[2:15:13.480 --> 2:15:21.480]  the FDA gave back the right or gave to the industry this right to direct a consumer advertising.
[2:15:21.480 --> 2:15:26.480]  So two countries in the world do this. Here in the United States and New Zealand, nowhere
[2:15:26.480 --> 2:15:33.480]  else in the world are the vaccine manufacturers or the drug makers able to to to advertise
[2:15:33.480 --> 2:15:37.480]  direct to their consumers. And what that did Alex is it did something very interesting.
[2:15:37.480 --> 2:15:42.480]  You see, I don't think they go on television with those ads, which have at the end of
[2:15:42.480 --> 2:15:48.480]  the day, a laughable number of adverse reactions, confusion for drugs for Alzheimer's for heaven's
[2:15:48.480 --> 2:15:53.480]  sake. I don't believe their principal aim is to sell drugs. What I think their aim is
[2:15:53.480 --> 2:16:01.480]  to do is to give so much money through this sponsorship to the mainstream media nightly
[2:16:01.480 --> 2:16:08.480]  news networks that they become dependent upon that income. And thereafter, the industry,
[2:16:08.480 --> 2:16:13.480]  the pharmaceutical industry owns the headlines. What they want published will be published
[2:16:13.480 --> 2:16:18.480]  and anything that criticizes their products will not be published. And this is a system
[2:16:18.480 --> 2:16:26.480]  that is now in place that has given them enormous power over the American media. So it's a really
[2:16:26.480 --> 2:16:32.480]  very, very precarious situation in which we find ourselves. And of course, their marketing
[2:16:32.480 --> 2:16:38.480]  ploy time after time after time has been fear. And the important thing about the film is
[2:16:38.480 --> 2:16:43.480]  that we are now living in this state where people are frightened and begging for a vaccine
[2:16:43.480 --> 2:16:48.480]  because they've been in had this fear instilled into them about COVID-19. We've been there
[2:16:48.480 --> 2:16:55.480]  before, not once, but many times. And every single time fear was what drove the commercial
[2:16:55.480 --> 2:17:00.480]  agenda. Make the people frightened, make the politicians frightened. Nothing motivates
[2:17:00.480 --> 2:17:05.480]  politicians quite like a plague. And here we are right in the midst of it now. So there
[2:17:05.480 --> 2:17:10.480]  could be no better time. There is no bigger audience aware now of the issues and facing
[2:17:10.480 --> 2:17:17.480]  not just childhood mandates, but now adult mandates as well, cradle to grave mandates.
[2:17:17.480 --> 2:17:24.480]  No, pregnancy to grave mandates. So people worldwide are becoming increasingly concerned
[2:17:24.480 --> 2:17:30.480]  and you're exactly right, Alex. You pointed out that when Gates goes on the media, he
[2:17:30.480 --> 2:17:36.480]  says, yep, we're going to give this vaccine to 7 billion people worldwide. When we do
[2:17:36.480 --> 2:17:41.480]  that, it's going to be causing some harm. There are some risks where rushing these things to
[2:17:41.480 --> 2:17:45.480]  market. This number of people are likely to get hurt. And of course, we're going to need
[2:17:45.480 --> 2:17:50.480]  indemnity because we don't want to be liable for the damage done. Shortcut the safety trials.
[2:17:50.480 --> 2:17:57.480]  No indemnity. You have a disaster. You cannot take products outside of the constraints of
[2:17:57.480 --> 2:18:03.480]  the free market without this kind of catastrophe. And just one more point, Alex, and this is
[2:18:03.480 --> 2:18:08.480]  you asked me the question about me. That's why I got my mic turned off. I want you to roll, sir.
[2:18:08.480 --> 2:18:13.480]  Okay, would you ask me about me? And it's interesting because this brings in texts. And as you know,
[2:18:13.480 --> 2:18:18.480]  I lived for a very long time in Austin. Austin was the kind of oasis for me when I left England
[2:18:18.480 --> 2:18:25.480]  and I left the Royal Free Hospital and I left my job and came to Texas and I absolutely,
[2:18:25.480 --> 2:18:31.480]  my heart is in Austin, Texas. And I, it was a bad time. There was a bad time and I was going
[2:18:31.480 --> 2:18:32.480]  through a lot.
[2:18:32.480 --> 2:18:36.480]  I can see it. You were in pain because you'd been a lot about it and you kept fighting on
[2:18:36.480 --> 2:18:39.480]  it. But again, it's a success story. Please continue.
[2:18:39.480 --> 2:18:45.480]  Well, I went down to Bandera one night. Alex, I went down there and I went outside the beautiful,
[2:18:45.480 --> 2:18:50.480]  beautiful rolling hills and I, it was pitch black. There was no ambient light.
[2:18:50.480 --> 2:18:54.480]  And I look up at the sky and there were billions and billions of stars.
[2:18:54.480 --> 2:19:00.480]  And I suddenly thought, you know what, this isn't about me at all. This is not about me.
[2:19:00.480 --> 2:19:05.480]  And as soon as I realized that, that everything they said, everything they did, everything
[2:19:05.480 --> 2:19:11.480]  that they done didn't make a button of difference. It was about something far, far more important
[2:19:11.480 --> 2:19:16.480]  than that is the health and well-being of children, our future.
[2:19:16.480 --> 2:19:22.480]  And suddenly this huge weight was lifted off me. And ever since that time, Alex, I have,
[2:19:22.480 --> 2:19:28.480]  it's been not only a privilege to do what I do, but I'm now doing something that I love
[2:19:28.480 --> 2:19:33.480]  and is communicating and educating people, entertaining people, but informing them in
[2:19:33.480 --> 2:19:35.480]  their best interests.
[2:19:35.480 --> 2:19:40.480]  And what I want to get across more than anything is that there is a very positive way of looking
[2:19:40.480 --> 2:19:45.480]  at this. And I showed it in the mini trailer earlier. And that is, it is a story.
[2:19:45.480 --> 2:19:50.480]  This movie is a story about one of the most powerful forces in the universe.
[2:19:50.480 --> 2:19:56.480]  An ancient wisdom, an ancient wisdom, which is maternal instinct, maternal intuition.
[2:19:56.480 --> 2:20:02.480]  The reason we are now here on this planet, not because of public health or vaccines or
[2:20:02.480 --> 2:20:07.480]  doctors or men in white coat, no, it's because mothers know their children instinctively
[2:20:07.480 --> 2:20:11.480]  and intuitively know when they're well and they know when they're ill.
[2:20:11.480 --> 2:20:14.480]  And big farmers not going to win its fight against women.
[2:20:14.480 --> 2:20:20.480]  You will never, you will not do it. And when women start to take that back, when they realize
[2:20:20.480 --> 2:20:25.480]  it, when they know that that little voice inside of them that was telling them that there was
[2:20:25.480 --> 2:20:30.480]  a problem, there was an issue, when they realize how powerful that is, not just individually
[2:20:30.480 --> 2:20:36.480]  but collectively, then it has an extraordinary impact. And this is happening worldwide now.
[2:20:36.480 --> 2:20:40.480]  It is. Dr. Weifel said there, you really touched my heart because I've had the exact same
[2:20:40.480 --> 2:20:44.480]  experience. You just talked about under the same Texas sky. This is incredible.
[2:20:44.480 --> 2:20:51.480]  Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins. There are many reasons why we need to think
[2:20:51.480 --> 2:20:56.480]  about what is really in the air around us. We may not be able to stop breathing, but
[2:20:56.480 --> 2:21:01.480]  we can control what's in the air we breathe. The revolutionary Alexa pure breeze air filtration

[2:21:39.480 --> 2:21:45.480]  this special today at infohorsestore.com. We need to get back to the land, back to self
[2:21:45.480 --> 2:21:49.480]  sufficiency and back to being prepared. And the way to start, ladies and gentlemen, is
[2:21:49.480 --> 2:21:54.480]  having friends and family with a bug out plan if there is a total collapse and water filtration
[2:21:54.480 --> 2:21:59.480]  and food to last you at least a few months. And the food we have is very high quality.
[2:21:59.480 --> 2:22:03.480]  It's in great containers that are great to be mobile. They have wide selection, special
[2:22:03.480 --> 2:22:08.480]  diets, you name it. It's the best price you're going to find, but you need to get the orders
[2:22:08.480 --> 2:22:12.480]  in now in the lull before the storm. I told you lockdown two was coming. The new world
[2:22:12.480 --> 2:22:17.480]  order is making its move. Whether Trump loses or wins, things are just going to get more
[2:22:17.480 --> 2:22:22.480]  crazy and this food lasts 25 years inside the containers. So it's something you can hide,
[2:22:22.480 --> 2:22:27.480]  something you can bury, something you know is the ace in the hole for you and your family
[2:22:27.480 --> 2:22:32.480]  in the future. And the little bit of profit that comes in, funds the info war to continue
[2:22:32.480 --> 2:22:37.480]  to warn the people. So you're also funding info wars, the most powerful Paul Revere organization
[2:22:37.480 --> 2:22:43.480]  in the world. It's powered by you.
[2:22:43.480 --> 2:22:48.480]  2020 is a very special year to the globalist, to the occultist, to those that are into esoteric
[2:22:48.480 --> 2:22:53.480]  mysticism. And they believe this is the year they're going to totally overthrow America
[2:22:53.480 --> 2:22:58.480]  and the world and bring in their anti God, anti human tyranny. Well, we're here on air
[2:22:58.480 --> 2:23:02.480]  and we just ask you all to realize that we're in opposition to this evil and that only your
[2:23:02.480 --> 2:23:06.480]  word of mouth helps us reach new people. And I want to salute you all and thank you for
[2:23:06.480 --> 2:23:10.480]  your support. And I also want you to know that our fourth of July, once a year mega sale

[2:23:46.480 --> 2:23:54.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:23:54.480 --> 2:24:10.480]  All right, Dr. Andrew Wakes, our guest. Again, I talk about the song Renegades by Steve Vaughan.
[2:24:10.480 --> 2:24:14.480]  Renegades are my heroes. The guy's a good man and I got chills up and down my spine whenever
[2:24:14.480 --> 2:24:21.480]  he talked about being out under the Texas Hill Country. Skies are bright, stars are
[2:24:21.480 --> 2:24:25.480]  bright deep in the heart of Texas, and he was talking about out there in the Texas Hill
[2:24:25.480 --> 2:24:30.480]  Country, Stair and Flow Stars. When I've had really bad things happen to us, just incredible
[2:24:30.480 --> 2:24:35.480]  lies and attacks on my family, which I expect, I'm not a victim, I'm an overcomer, but it's
[2:24:35.480 --> 2:24:43.480]  not fun. There's this part of you that just defaults to, hey, my name is expendable, I'm
[2:24:43.480 --> 2:24:48.480]  physically expendable, I'm a man. And he talks about the power of women's intuition. The
[2:24:48.480 --> 2:24:53.480]  circle's not complete. Women know what's happening. That's why Hitler said, first you get the
[2:24:53.480 --> 2:24:57.480]  women, then you've got the children, so follow the men. That's why 80% of advertising
[2:24:57.480 --> 2:25:03.480]  targets women. It's not that women are dumb, they are the fount. They're the target. In
[2:25:03.480 --> 2:25:09.480]  fact, it gets into a lot of sophistication, but men are the manifestation of what
[2:25:09.480 --> 2:25:14.480]  genetically the female decides to do. And you can say the sperm chooses the sex, it's
[2:25:14.480 --> 2:25:19.480]  male, all the rest of it, but it's a lot of really amazing things that are going on
[2:25:19.480 --> 2:25:26.480]  here. And there is no male, there is no female. There is the human race and who we are in
[2:25:26.480 --> 2:25:31.480]  our incredible relationship with each other. And the satanic nature of trying to divide
[2:25:31.480 --> 2:25:37.480]  that is just unspeakably bad. It's a joke, it's cancer. It's like Monsanto wants seeds
[2:25:37.480 --> 2:25:42.480]  that don't produce new seeds. It's a corporate takeover of the life functions of the
[2:25:42.480 --> 2:25:45.480]  planet because these corporate guys just see that as, well, we'll just take everything
[2:25:45.480 --> 2:25:52.480]  over, we'll be God. It's delusion. But I've been there in those scary dark places and
[2:25:52.480 --> 2:25:57.480]  then it's just like, hey, think about the children. I was looking up at the stars years
[2:25:57.480 --> 2:26:01.480]  ago, this happened. And I just have it every time I've been depressed or upset. And I'm
[2:26:01.480 --> 2:26:05.480]  like, each one of those little stars like a human soul. And we're not going to let them
[2:26:05.480 --> 2:26:10.480]  black those out or mark those out. I've got to do what I've got to do because this is
[2:26:10.480 --> 2:26:15.480]  about me. And I'm going to humble myself and be ready even if I get destroyed. And people
[2:26:15.480 --> 2:26:19.480]  hate my name for a thousand years, who cares? Or forget who I am. It doesn't matter. I've
[2:26:19.480 --> 2:26:23.480]  got to do this for the children. And I think Dr. Wakefield, that's what you were saying.
[2:26:23.480 --> 2:26:26.480]  That was very deep. And I bet a lot of other men have had that experience. And I think
[2:26:26.480 --> 2:26:32.480]  what you're saying, your idea for the film is men's service. It's beyond chivalry. It
[2:26:32.480 --> 2:26:35.480]  really is service to women and children, isn't it?
[2:26:35.480 --> 2:26:40.480]  I think if men recognize this innate power, I mean, I've come across so many couples, Alex,
[2:26:40.480 --> 2:26:44.480]  where they have been fighting about, we're going to vaccinate, no, we're not. And the
[2:26:44.480 --> 2:26:49.480]  wife is saying, look, there's something about this that just doesn't feel right. The husband
[2:26:49.480 --> 2:26:54.480]  says, get over it. What about polio? What about smallpox? Vaccines are safe? Well, and
[2:26:54.480 --> 2:26:56.480]  walk out of room. Walk out of room.
[2:26:56.480 --> 2:26:58.480]  Is this the women that are saying no?
[2:26:58.480 --> 2:27:03.480]  The women are saying no. And what they say, they're saying no, not deductively, not logically,
[2:27:03.480 --> 2:27:08.480]  just listening to that voice. And when that voice speaks, you listen to it. And the doctors
[2:27:08.480 --> 2:27:13.480]  don't want you to recognize that voice. It's power. They want you to usurp your power.
[2:27:13.480 --> 2:27:20.480]  Take it over. No. Go inside yourself. Look to an internal authority, not to that external
[2:27:20.480 --> 2:27:26.480]  authority, for how you should look after your children, because that force is so powerful.
[2:27:26.480 --> 2:27:31.480]  It's why we are here right now on this earth. And as I say in that mini trailer, it's why
[2:27:31.480 --> 2:27:38.480]  we will be here if we listen to it in a thousand years, 10,000 years time. And I cannot, let
[2:27:38.480 --> 2:27:43.480]  me give you an example, Alex. I was looking at an essay that was sent to me by a public
[2:27:43.480 --> 2:27:47.480]  health student in Samoa, where as you probably know, they had a recent outbreak of measles
[2:27:47.480 --> 2:27:52.480]  and they had a lot of deaths and there has been no public inquiry into why, but there
[2:27:52.480 --> 2:27:57.480]  are many reasons and we're filming this at the moment. Now, the important thing about
[2:27:57.480 --> 2:28:02.480]  this is this student went back into the history of measles in Samoa and looked at it way back
[2:28:02.480 --> 2:28:09.480]  in time when it was a killer of children. And he said it was notable, but in those villages
[2:28:09.480 --> 2:28:16.480]  where they had a well-formed and empowered women's committees, they kept the mortality
[2:28:16.480 --> 2:28:21.480]  and morbidity to a very minimum. In other words, that's nothing to do with doctors, nothing
[2:28:21.480 --> 2:28:27.480]  to do with public health or vaccines. That is the collective intelligence, the innate
[2:28:27.480 --> 2:28:29.480]  intelligence of these women coming together.
[2:28:29.480 --> 2:28:30.480]  You're controlling the heart.
[2:28:30.480 --> 2:28:37.480]  What is best, exactly. And it is so powerful. It's not an emotional argument. It is a survival
[2:28:37.480 --> 2:28:43.480]  imperative. It is absolutely crucial and people need to recognize it and take it back.
[2:28:43.480 --> 2:28:47.480]  Well, that's right. I didn't mean to get all mushy earlier, but it's true like that. Go
[2:28:47.480 --> 2:28:53.480]  back to that moment when you're out there under the stars and you realize that it is the collective.
[2:28:53.480 --> 2:28:58.480]  I mean, it really is. I'm going to do this as a matter. And the moment the fear, the
[2:28:58.480 --> 2:29:00.480]  depression ends, it's so empowering.
[2:29:00.480 --> 2:29:06.480]  It was an extraordinary moment. It suddenly evaporated when I realized that, you know,
[2:29:06.480 --> 2:29:12.480]  I thought to myself at the time, look at the size of the billions and billions of stars.
[2:29:12.480 --> 2:29:17.480]  The universe doesn't care about Andy Wakefield. Now I've since met people who've persuaded
[2:29:17.480 --> 2:29:22.480]  me that actually the universe is invested in each and every single one of us. But it
[2:29:22.480 --> 2:29:26.480]  made me, it made it so much easier to say, look, buddy, you don't have a problem. That
[2:29:26.480 --> 2:29:31.480]  child sitting there or running around the room or banging their head against the wall or
[2:29:31.480 --> 2:29:32.480]  screaming.
[2:29:32.480 --> 2:29:33.480]  They need you.
[2:29:33.480 --> 2:29:38.480]  And your job is to get on and sort this out to the best of your ability. So get over yourself
[2:29:38.480 --> 2:29:43.480]  and do it. And beyond that moment, it became so much easier.
[2:29:43.480 --> 2:29:48.480]  How did you pioneer? Because I mean, folks, if you haven't been attention, like everything
[2:29:48.480 --> 2:29:52.480]  he researched with his little lab for to be accurate, how did you pioneer discovering
[2:29:52.480 --> 2:29:56.480]  the gut brain connection? How did you find that?
[2:29:56.480 --> 2:30:00.480]  It wasn't terribly clever. I just listened to the mothers. The mothers said, my child
[2:30:00.480 --> 2:30:07.480]  has autism. I've come to see you as a gastroenterologist because they have severe gastrointestinal issues.
[2:30:07.480 --> 2:30:08.480]  That was a mothers again.
[2:30:08.480 --> 2:30:13.480]  A mothers again. And the doctors have put all the medical professionals I've spoken to
[2:30:13.480 --> 2:30:18.480]  have just said, oh, your child's got autism. They're bound to have diarrhea 12 times a
[2:30:18.480 --> 2:30:22.480]  day or bloating or pain. So put them in a home and forget about them and move on. That
[2:30:22.480 --> 2:30:26.480]  was the kind of thing that we were hearing. And so I just listened. I put the orders on
[2:30:26.480 --> 2:30:31.480]  one side and I said, okay, and they said, doctor, when this is bad, when the intestine is bad,
[2:30:31.480 --> 2:30:34.480]  the behavior is bad. When this is good, this is good.
[2:30:34.480 --> 2:30:38.480]  The Gutsman program to create poison. Explain how that works.
[2:30:38.480 --> 2:30:44.480]  It turns out Bill Gates is obsessed with this, as you know. He wants to corner the market on this now.
[2:30:44.480 --> 2:30:49.480]  Yes. Well, you know, it's going to be a very fruitful market when we understand it. But
[2:30:49.480 --> 2:30:55.480]  what we now know is that the gut and gut bacteria in particular are at the very core of our
[2:30:55.480 --> 2:31:00.480]  immune system development, but also our brain and our nervous system development. They
[2:31:00.480 --> 2:31:06.480]  modify our behavior. So we have believed that bacteria were an enemy since the time of
[2:31:06.480 --> 2:31:12.480]  Pasteur and tried to kill them with antibiotics. No, they're absolutely essential for our own
[2:31:12.480 --> 2:31:18.480]  well-being. No man is an island. We are entirely dependent on the health of the gut bacteria.
[2:31:18.480 --> 2:31:21.480]  So there's important is white blood cells.
[2:31:21.480 --> 2:31:26.480]  White blood cells are really our immune system and they are the one of the sort of
[2:31:26.480 --> 2:31:31.480]  intermediaries between the gut. They're the officers. They like run the operation.
[2:31:31.480 --> 2:31:38.480]  That's right. They either switch on and cause inflammation and attack against microorganisms
[2:31:38.480 --> 2:31:44.480]  or they switch off. So they should switch off to good bacteria. And the problem is auto
[2:31:44.480 --> 2:31:51.480]  immune disease. Many of them come about when the immune system starts to respond to things
[2:31:51.480 --> 2:31:57.480]  it shouldn't respond to, gut bacteria or food, food proteins that should be innocuous that
[2:31:57.480 --> 2:32:03.480]  we should be dependent on suddenly become something that trigger an abnormal immune
[2:32:03.480 --> 2:32:09.480]  response of food allergy, for example. And there's no doubt that in the mix, triggering
[2:32:09.480 --> 2:32:16.480]  this process, triggering this myriad of auto immune diseases, gut diseases are vaccines
[2:32:16.480 --> 2:32:21.480]  in my opinion. Well, it's not your opinion though. I mean the whole systems of New York
[2:32:21.480 --> 2:32:25.480]  Times, Washington Post, thousands of studies now since you talked about this and you literally
[2:32:25.480 --> 2:32:30.480]  just got this from mothers. And then you tested it too and we improved it.
[2:32:30.480 --> 2:32:36.480]  And that is why Alex, when the mothers said and I believe that this happened after a
[2:32:36.480 --> 2:32:41.480]  vaccination, I wasn't at a vaccine. I took my child we vaccinated on time. This is what
[2:32:41.480 --> 2:32:47.480]  happened. So when the mothers said, this is what I believe happened to my child, they
[2:32:47.480 --> 2:32:53.480]  fell ill and the permanently injured after a vaccine, we had an absolute moral and
[2:32:53.480 --> 2:32:58.480]  professional obligation to heed what they were saying and act upon it. They had been
[2:32:58.480 --> 2:33:02.480]  right about everything else. The medical profession had been almost completely to a man
[2:33:02.480 --> 2:33:07.480]  and a woman wrong. And we listened and I absolutely believe that they are correct.
[2:33:07.480 --> 2:33:13.480]  And what convinces me that they're correct, Alex about vaccines and MMR in particular
[2:33:13.480 --> 2:33:19.480]  is the need for the CDC to actually fraudulently cover that up and destroy the documents,
[2:33:19.480 --> 2:33:23.480]  which of course was the substance of our last film facts.
[2:33:23.480 --> 2:33:26.480]  We'll play the next trailer for this and talk about it with Dr. Wakefield. And I didn't
[2:33:26.480 --> 2:33:29.480]  even know you'd left Austin. Well, if I'm not where you're at now, but we'd love to
[2:33:29.480 --> 2:33:32.480]  get your studio flagging down here. We'll be right back. It was on David Knight last
[2:33:32.480 --> 2:33:36.480]  week. Did a great job. Dr. Wakefield's here. Get the new film. We'll tell you about it when
[2:33:36.480 --> 2:33:38.480]  we come back. Stay with us.
[2:33:42.480 --> 2:33:46.480]  Just during the break, I went and got a delicious cup, a second cup of the day.
[2:33:46.480 --> 2:33:50.480]  It's really strong. I shouldn't do this because all work and no playmates jack a
[2:33:50.480 --> 2:33:54.480]  really aggressive boy and the coffee has to wake up America coffee there by loves
[2:33:54.480 --> 2:33:57.480]  highest rated in the choppers mountains. It's beyond Mexican coffee, beyond

[2:35:41.480 --> 2:35:42.480]  you all.
[2:35:43.480 --> 2:35:47.480]  It just happened on Tuesday morning driving into work about to break the big
[2:35:47.480 --> 2:35:52.480]  Roger Stone news and the big COVID-19 hoax news. And I met a red light at the
[2:35:52.480 --> 2:35:56.480]  corner of Brody and 290 and an old Mercedes pulls up next to me and a
[2:35:56.480 --> 2:36:00.480]  Hispanic man and two white women start flipping me off and I thought they
[2:36:00.480 --> 2:36:05.480]  recognized who I was. So I rolled down my window and I said, what COVID-19 is a
[2:36:05.480 --> 2:36:10.480]  hoax? And they were going, FU, FU, FU, FU, FU. And I said, is that your IQ? One
[2:36:10.480 --> 2:36:14.480]  finger? So they got put up two fingers. I said, oh, it's 11. And I was like, do
[2:36:14.480 --> 2:36:17.480]  you know who I am? They're like shaking their heads. They go, where your
[2:36:17.480 --> 2:36:21.480]  mask? Where your mask? And they're pointing at the mask. So I guess Joy
[2:36:21.480 --> 2:36:24.480]  Bay Harbor, she says she goes around and does this with her husband. This is a
[2:36:24.480 --> 2:36:28.480]  thing, man. Their cult is going crazy. They're control freaks. They're
[2:36:28.480 --> 2:36:32.480]  attacking language, borders, everything because they all bet on leftist garbage
[2:36:32.480 --> 2:36:36.480]  and hasn't delivered to them. So they're totally going completely insane. This is
[2:36:36.480 --> 2:37:05.480]  crazy.
[2:37:06.480 --> 2:37:16.480]  This is the case of COVID-19. It's in the NIH documents. It's at the state level.
[2:37:16.480 --> 2:37:20.480]  We confirmed it in Texas. We're now confirming it's in other states. This is
[2:37:20.480 --> 2:37:24.480]  beyond the other smoking guns of them putting people with a shotgun shot wounds
[2:37:24.480 --> 2:37:28.480]  and stuff in the COVID column and the false positive test. That's all huge. This
[2:37:28.480 --> 2:37:34.480]  is beyond that mega criminal activity. And we've got these ever kind of
[2:37:34.480 --> 2:37:38.480]  commission videos where they're just freaking out over it saying what in the
[2:37:38.480 --> 2:37:42.480]  world is this? The full video is posted at man.video. Get it out and expose the
[2:37:42.480 --> 2:37:46.480]  hoax.
[2:37:46.480 --> 2:37:54.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:37:54.480 --> 2:38:09.480]  The
[2:38:09.480 --> 2:38:14.480]  efficacy of vaccines in older people is always a huge challenge. It turns out
[2:38:14.480 --> 2:38:19.480]  the flu vaccine isn't that effective in older people. We clearly need a
[2:38:19.480 --> 2:38:25.480]  vaccine that works in the upper age range because they're most at risk of that.
[2:38:25.480 --> 2:38:30.480]  And doing that so that you amp it up so it works in older people and yet you
[2:38:30.480 --> 2:38:39.480]  don't have side effects. If we have 1 in 10,000 side effects, that's way more
[2:38:39.480 --> 2:38:46.480]  700,000 people who will suffer from that. And that actual decision of let's go
[2:38:46.480 --> 2:38:51.480]  and give this vaccine to the entire world, governments will have to be involved
[2:38:51.480 --> 2:38:58.480]  because there will be some risk and indemnification needed to Bill Gates
[2:38:58.480 --> 2:39:04.480]  reiping you. And we have the articles up on m4s.com. The U.N. came out in December
[2:39:04.480 --> 2:39:08.480]  last year and said, no, we've covered it up. The doctors, the frontline is wobbly.
[2:39:08.480 --> 2:39:12.480]  People don't believe in this. We do no testing. And in the 10 minutes we have
[2:39:12.480 --> 2:39:20.480]  left Dr. Wakefield condensing down, I see this whole COVID-19 hoax and they
[2:39:20.480 --> 2:39:25.480]  skipped animal trials and people that were like the pet project, people are
[2:39:25.480 --> 2:39:29.480]  actually sick almost died that took it. What do you think is going on right now?
[2:39:29.480 --> 2:39:33.480]  I'm really worried, Alex, just as you are. You know, when I've been back into the
[2:39:33.480 --> 2:39:37.480]  history of these vaccine trials, when they've rushed things to market in the
[2:39:37.480 --> 2:39:42.480]  face of a swine flu, a predicted swine flu pandemic, that never happens.
[2:39:42.480 --> 2:39:46.480]  It didn't happen. It didn't work. It didn't. There was no need for it yet.
[2:39:46.480 --> 2:39:50.480]  A lot of people got hurt. A lot of people got what's called Guillain-Barre syndrome,
[2:39:50.480 --> 2:39:55.480]  paralysis. Many died. It was totally unnecessary. The CDC got it wrong.
[2:39:55.480 --> 2:40:01.480]  And we have this same model being predicted time and time again, fear being
[2:40:01.480 --> 2:40:08.480]  the key, indemnity being negotiated with Congress and people being forced to take
[2:40:08.480 --> 2:40:15.480]  a risk. And it's just happens that this time with COVID-19, it's worse.
[2:40:15.480 --> 2:40:20.480]  By many orders of magnitude, they're using vaccine strategies that have never
[2:40:20.480 --> 2:40:26.480]  been used before. They have no idea what the medium or long term outcome is,
[2:40:26.480 --> 2:40:34.480]  let alone the short term outcome. And yet people are rushing to take part in the
[2:40:34.480 --> 2:40:38.480]  trials to get this vaccine. I'm surprised. What is interesting, though, is that
[2:40:38.480 --> 2:40:42.480]  people have never been more aware of this. And I see now this just this week.
[2:40:42.480 --> 2:40:47.480]  30% won't take it. 50% won't take it. If 30% don't take it, we're not going to
[2:40:47.480 --> 2:40:51.480]  achieve vaccine herd immunity. The vaccine may only last three months.
[2:40:51.480 --> 2:40:57.480]  It may not last at all. I mean, who would take these risks?
[2:40:57.480 --> 2:41:02.480]  What is emerging as a disease that is no worse than a seasonal flu?
[2:41:02.480 --> 2:41:05.480]  And it's extremely worrying.
[2:41:05.480 --> 2:41:07.480]  And let me interrupt you for the president of the United States.
[2:41:07.480 --> 2:41:11.480]  Trump has tweeted breaking news. The mortality rate for the China virus in the
[2:41:11.480 --> 2:41:16.480]  U.S. is just about the lowest in the world. Also, deaths in the U.S. are way down.
[2:41:16.480 --> 2:41:20.480]  Tenfold decrease since the pandemic height. And our economy is coming back.
[2:41:20.480 --> 2:41:22.480]  Let me ask you this other way, fellas. You're a prestigious scientist and a
[2:41:22.480 --> 2:41:27.480]  trailblazer. Real doctors, my dad's a doctor. You actually listen to patients.
[2:41:27.480 --> 2:41:31.480]  What's going on? You go to what works. Clearly, scientists have looked at this
[2:41:31.480 --> 2:41:35.480]  virus and it's got gene gun edited. It's a bunch of stuff. It looks like some kind
[2:41:35.480 --> 2:41:39.480]  of vaccine simulant or vaccine ingredient that got out. I've got that from
[2:41:39.480 --> 2:41:42.480]  actually UN and CIA and a lot of big sources. They told me this six months ago.
[2:41:42.480 --> 2:41:46.480]  It turns out that Dr. Boyle has been right. So it has great gain of function.
[2:41:46.480 --> 2:41:50.480]  But if you're not deficient in vitamins and things, very low death rate.
[2:41:50.480 --> 2:41:53.480]  But then you combine that with them hyping it up, putting people from things that
[2:41:53.480 --> 2:41:57.480]  out of heart attacks, cancer in the list. What, because I haven't figured it out yet.
[2:41:57.480 --> 2:42:02.480]  What the hell is, is it real? Is it overblown? What is COVID-19, doctor?
[2:42:02.480 --> 2:42:06.480]  I think, I mean, I said from the very beginning, Alex, that this is something
[2:42:06.480 --> 2:42:10.480]  that came out of a laboratory in China. It is unthinkable that there could be a
[2:42:10.480 --> 2:42:14.480]  coincidental emergence of a novel coronavirus in the place where they have
[2:42:14.480 --> 2:42:18.480]  the coronavirus essentially bio weapons research facility.
[2:42:18.480 --> 2:42:24.480]  Just a backstory to this. Years ago, we were dealing with an ex-member of MI5.
[2:42:24.480 --> 2:42:28.480]  His job at MI5 was as an Uber hacker. He was a man who would hack into
[2:42:28.480 --> 2:42:33.480]  anything at any time on behalf of the secret service. And once he left, he came
[2:42:33.480 --> 2:42:37.480]  to do a bit of work with us and he came to work one day and he said,
[2:42:37.480 --> 2:42:42.480]  you'll never believe it, but this SARS virus that has just, you know,
[2:42:42.480 --> 2:42:48.480]  impacted the world. This came about because there was an earthquake
[2:42:48.480 --> 2:42:52.480]  in central China that destroyed or damaged a bio weapons facility. And then he was
[2:42:52.480 --> 2:42:56.480]  contacted by his minder. They all have minders once they leave the service,
[2:42:56.480 --> 2:43:00.480]  who said, you will forget what you just saw and you will never do this again.
[2:43:00.480 --> 2:43:04.480]  Do not mention it. And so that's really interesting, but I don't believe these
[2:43:04.480 --> 2:43:08.480]  things could possibly, in light of that, in light of the proximity of this
[2:43:08.480 --> 2:43:12.480]  laboratory to the outbreak, there was no-
[2:43:12.480 --> 2:43:16.480]  And Fauci was running a bunch of the programs under Obama that got outlawed
[2:43:16.480 --> 2:43:19.480]  here in 2015 were moved to Wuhan. You can't make this up.
[2:43:19.480 --> 2:43:24.480]  That's really worrying because I would call that treasonous. If that turns out to be true,
[2:43:24.480 --> 2:43:28.480]  that they were moved offshore after Obama outlawed them after scientists
[2:43:28.480 --> 2:43:33.480]  wrote saying, you should never do this kind of study. You have no idea what you're doing
[2:43:33.480 --> 2:43:37.480]  and no idea what the consequences might be. And so it was then apparently moved
[2:43:37.480 --> 2:43:41.480]  offshore was done in Wuhan with American funding. And if
[2:43:41.480 --> 2:43:45.480]  Dr. Fauci was in any way involved in that process, then
[2:43:45.480 --> 2:43:49.480]  he needs to be held accountable. But it was quite right, those scientists
[2:43:49.480 --> 2:43:53.480]  when they predicted that you do not know what you're doing and there are going to be
[2:43:53.480 --> 2:43:57.480]  problems with this, the world is now experiencing that problem.
[2:43:57.480 --> 2:44:00.480]  What is wrong with these mad scientists? I mean, you've been around the world.
[2:44:00.480 --> 2:44:04.480]  What is the problem with them? I mean, I don't get it.
[2:44:04.480 --> 2:44:08.480]  Well, I think in this case, there was this idea that
[2:44:08.480 --> 2:44:12.480]  we if we're not doing it, someone else is going to do it and we may be at risk.
[2:44:12.480 --> 2:44:16.480]  So we got to build the weapon to create a vaccine, but you just built the weapon.
[2:44:16.480 --> 2:44:20.480]  Yeah, I just don't buy that. I don't believe it. Can we just get everybody together and stop producing
[2:44:20.480 --> 2:44:24.480]  this? Stop doing it. Stop doing it. Learn from
[2:44:24.480 --> 2:44:28.480]  this dreadful mistake. And it must never, ever happen again.
[2:44:28.480 --> 2:44:34.480]  Don't these people love their children? I mean, why? Why do they keep doing it?
[2:44:34.480 --> 2:44:38.480]  Oh, someone may create a super weapon. We better do it.
[2:44:38.480 --> 2:44:42.480]  And the vaccines are emerging to be the same. This is going to compound the problem enormously
[2:44:42.480 --> 2:44:46.480]  in my opinion. They are creating these Frankenstein viruses that are
[2:44:46.480 --> 2:44:50.480]  using the backbone of one virus with the genes of another virus.
[2:44:50.480 --> 2:44:54.480]  That lets it jump species. Yeah, you know, I don't mean to interrupt.
[2:44:54.480 --> 2:44:58.480]  No, go ahead. No, no, no. And so we saw this as you will well
[2:44:58.480 --> 2:45:02.480]  know with the dengue fever virus vaccine
[2:45:02.480 --> 2:45:06.480]  in the Far East. We saw that they produced this
[2:45:06.480 --> 2:45:10.480]  vaccine. The manufacturers knew there were problems with it. It was a Frankenstein
[2:45:10.480 --> 2:45:14.480]  virus, a hybrid of a number of viruses that when they
[2:45:14.480 --> 2:45:18.480]  gave it, it produced antibodies. It didn't appear to produce
[2:45:18.480 --> 2:45:22.480]  any adverse reactions. But when those individuals were exposed
[2:45:22.480 --> 2:45:26.480]  to the dengue fever virus, they
[2:45:26.480 --> 2:45:30.480]  developed severe, often fatal, disease in this
[2:45:30.480 --> 2:45:34.480]  process. Oh, it's a binary weapon. Explain that to us. So they're
[2:45:34.480 --> 2:45:38.480]  being pre-program explained as an expert on this.
[2:45:38.480 --> 2:45:42.480]  Well, it seems to be that the immune system is triggered
[2:45:42.480 --> 2:45:46.480]  to overreact next time it encounters the virus. So you're not protected
[2:45:46.480 --> 2:45:50.480]  against it. Quite the opposite. Next time you see it, then your
[2:45:50.480 --> 2:45:54.480]  immunity or immune system goes into overdrive and causes disease
[2:45:54.480 --> 2:45:58.480]  and death. And this is well recognized. It happened with
[2:45:58.480 --> 2:46:02.480]  the SARS virus vaccine.
[2:46:02.480 --> 2:46:06.480]  We're all prime now that next time something shows up in this family, we have an autoimmune response
[2:46:06.480 --> 2:46:10.480]  of Spanish flu and die. And Bill Gates magically says, this is event 201.
[2:46:10.480 --> 2:46:14.480]  He said, on Colbert, he goes, this is a drill.
[2:46:14.480 --> 2:46:18.480]  He said, the big one's coming. And he said, a terrorist is going to release it. Yeah, I think
[2:46:18.480 --> 2:46:22.480]  his name is Bill Gates.
[2:46:22.480 --> 2:46:26.480]  So it is deeply worrying. We interfere with nature
[2:46:26.480 --> 2:46:30.480]  at a huge price. So nature doesn't exact that price immediately. In most
[2:46:30.480 --> 2:46:34.480]  cases, it does it insidiously and it is widespread through the
[2:46:34.480 --> 2:46:38.480]  population. So we have to be extremely careful when we're doing this kind
[2:46:38.480 --> 2:46:42.480]  of thing. And here we are for shortening all of the safety
[2:46:42.480 --> 2:46:46.480]  studies, rushing it to market. That can only lead
[2:46:46.480 --> 2:46:50.480]  to problem. Why do you think in closing, and I really appreciate your time and the film is so
[2:46:50.480 --> 2:46:54.480]  exciting, I want to have you back on a routine basis. It's been too long. Why are they
[2:46:54.480 --> 2:46:58.480]  so arrogant with a big pushback even by the UN scientists
[2:46:58.480 --> 2:47:02.480]  and just everything and like the test and the trials going badly
[2:47:02.480 --> 2:47:06.480]  and they just don't care. What is that? I don't know. Every prediction that they've made
[2:47:06.480 --> 2:47:10.480]  has come adrift. Everything that they've said has really
[2:47:10.480 --> 2:47:14.480]  turned out to be false. The predictions of what is going to happen to the economy. I mean
[2:47:14.480 --> 2:47:18.480]  it really is catastrophic and
[2:47:18.480 --> 2:47:22.480]  nobody seems to be learning. Nobody wants to take responsibility
[2:47:22.480 --> 2:47:26.480]  and there's no accountability. I mean just what happened in New York
[2:47:26.480 --> 2:47:30.480]  for example, with the highest and extraordinarily high mortality rate
[2:47:30.480 --> 2:47:34.480]  which was nothing to do with the virus. Absolutely.
[2:47:34.480 --> 2:47:38.480]  So I, there are many lessons to learn from
[2:47:38.480 --> 2:47:42.480]  this but there are going to have to be changes. Alright, Doc, the film
[2:47:42.480 --> 2:47:46.480]  when does it come out? 30 seconds left. How do I see this?
[2:47:46.480 --> 2:47:50.480]  It comes out two minutes past midnight on Wednesday, 1986
[2:47:50.480 --> 2:47:54.480]  the act, 1986 the act.com. Go there, watch the movie,
[2:47:54.480 --> 2:47:58.480]  get it in the hands of your friends and family, get it in the hands of politicians
[2:47:58.480 --> 2:48:02.480]  and demand change. You will only vote for those people
[2:48:02.480 --> 2:48:06.480]  who will put your children first before the well-being, the profiteering
[2:48:06.480 --> 2:48:10.480]  of the pharmaceutical companies. We've got to fight the big pharma
[2:48:10.480 --> 2:48:14.480]  that wants to put things in our bodies. Dr. Wakefield, come back with us again the next month
[2:48:14.480 --> 2:48:18.480]  please don't wait a couple years. We really appreciate you and God bless you.
[2:48:18.480 --> 2:48:22.480]  Thank you, Alex. Very powerful. Alright, I'll do a couple of seconds
[2:48:22.480 --> 2:48:26.480]  until they've taken over. Well, that was out of the park interview. It's so important.
[2:48:26.480 --> 2:48:30.480]  It's life-saving. We're going to post the Band-Aid video, share this interview.
[2:48:32.480 --> 2:48:36.480]  The globalists want us domesticated. They want us inside our homes
[2:48:36.480 --> 2:48:40.480]  watching our televisions and being controlled by our, quote, smart phones.
[2:48:40.480 --> 2:48:44.480]  Everybody knows this. It's their admitted goal. We've had whistleblowers from Facebook,
[2:48:44.480 --> 2:48:48.480]  Twitter and Google go public and say at the highest levels, their job
[2:48:48.480 --> 2:48:52.480]  is to make you neurotic, destroy your mind and take over your life.
[2:48:52.480 --> 2:48:56.480]  And now the COVID hysteria is all about that. I recently had a woman
[2:48:56.480 --> 2:49:00.480]  in the street walls with my youngest daughter and my daughter walked close to her
[2:49:00.480 --> 2:49:04.480]  and she said, get away six feet and gave her a super
[2:49:04.480 --> 2:49:08.480]  ugly look. This, ladies and gentlemen, is mental illness.
[2:49:08.480 --> 2:49:12.480]  My daughter walking four feet from some old woman is not a crime. The old
[2:49:12.480 --> 2:49:16.480]  woman's mental illness is the crime if we give in to it.
[2:49:16.480 --> 2:49:20.480]  This is total and complete mind control. We must
[2:49:20.480 --> 2:49:24.480]  expose the COVID hoax now. They are going to continue to clamp down
[2:49:24.480 --> 2:49:28.480]  using this. It's a UN Bill Gates plan. They've been proven to be criminal liars
[2:49:28.480 --> 2:49:34.480]  and they must be defeated. They must be exposed.
[2:49:34.480 --> 2:49:38.480]  As we enter the critical months of July, it is very important
[2:49:38.480 --> 2:49:42.480]  for listeners and viewers to understand that all of the major
[2:49:42.480 --> 2:49:46.480]  storable food companies had been sold out of food for months.
[2:49:46.480 --> 2:49:50.480]  My Patriot supply, our supplier, was out to an eight week wait
[2:49:50.480 --> 2:49:54.480]  not because they didn't have food but because their four plants were backed up, packaging
[2:49:54.480 --> 2:49:58.480]  and getting it out. Now, they are at three to four weeks
[2:49:58.480 --> 2:50:02.480]  right now. They've gotten over the hump. Their other competitors are
[2:50:02.480 --> 2:50:06.480]  completely sold out or selling old garbage. This is high quality
[2:50:06.480 --> 2:50:10.480]  food. I would advise everyone to do what I'm doing and buy more storable food
[2:50:10.480 --> 2:50:14.480]  now before the next big hump comes because if you think things
[2:50:14.480 --> 2:50:18.480]  are about to settle down, think again. The world is only going to get more
[2:50:18.480 --> 2:50:22.480]  insane. I've been telling you this for six months. Ladies and gentlemen, if you don't have firearms
[2:50:22.480 --> 2:50:26.480]  or ammo and water filtration, you better get it. If you don't have storable food, you better get it.
[2:50:26.480 --> 2:50:30.480]  Go to infowarstore.com to take care of the water filtration and to take care of the storable foods.
[2:50:30.480 --> 2:50:34.480]  Get your orders in now before the next big rush.
[2:50:34.480 --> 2:50:38.480]  You're listening to the Alex Jones
[2:50:38.480 --> 2:50:42.480]  show.
[2:50:46.480 --> 2:50:50.480]  By the way, welcome back to my own show. This is going to come up in about 15 minutes.
[2:50:50.480 --> 2:50:54.480]  10 minutes or so and have a baton to him. There's all these articles
[2:50:54.480 --> 2:50:58.480]  out going, oh, Fox News, CNN, OK, Trump's right. Hydroxychloroquine cuts
[2:50:58.480 --> 2:51:02.480]  death rate in half.
[2:51:02.480 --> 2:51:06.480]  It's beyond that. Hydroxychloroquine
[2:51:06.480 --> 2:51:10.480]  pushes zinc into the cells.
[2:51:10.480 --> 2:51:14.480]  Coronaviruses cannot replicate with zinc.
[2:51:14.480 --> 2:51:18.480]  If you take 100 milligrams a day, the studies, there's literally hundreds of them.
[2:51:18.480 --> 2:51:22.480]  You can't do it. Now, here's a little problem.
[2:51:22.480 --> 2:51:26.480]  You take 100 milligrams of zinc for a couple years, you're going to have kidney failure.
[2:51:26.480 --> 2:51:30.480]  But no, I mean, that's what the universe works like. We're not going to live forever,
[2:51:30.480 --> 2:51:34.480]  but nothing's invincible.
[2:51:34.480 --> 2:51:38.480]  But it's beatable. You take 30 milligrams of zinc.
[2:51:38.480 --> 2:51:42.480]  That's three times daily allowance. You're covered.
[2:51:42.480 --> 2:51:46.480]  You're bulletproof at 100.
[2:51:46.480 --> 2:51:50.480]  You think I didn't research this? I care about my family.
[2:51:50.480 --> 2:51:54.480]  I mean, my wife was like six months ago, just five months ago.
[2:51:54.480 --> 2:51:58.480]  You're locked in this room with printouts five feet tall.
[2:51:58.480 --> 2:52:02.480]  What the hell are you doing?
[2:52:02.480 --> 2:52:06.480]  And I'm like, I got to read these studies.
[2:52:06.480 --> 2:52:10.480]  I got to know what I'm talking about.
[2:52:10.480 --> 2:52:14.480]  And that's the problem. Most people don't. They just, they just, oh, I heard
[2:52:14.480 --> 2:52:18.480]  news, whatever. You take vitamin D3. You take zinc.
[2:52:18.480 --> 2:52:22.480]  You take
[2:52:22.480 --> 2:52:26.480]  vitamin C.
[2:52:26.480 --> 2:52:30.480]  You're bulletproof as FU. You know what?
[2:52:30.480 --> 2:52:34.480]  If you've got everything else, and it's not like
[2:52:34.480 --> 2:52:38.480]  people go, oh, Jones sells snake oil. I'm not even.
[2:52:38.480 --> 2:52:42.480]  Jones needs to be arrested. He's claiming he's got a cure of COVID-19.
[2:52:42.480 --> 2:52:46.480]  You know, I could take
[2:52:46.480 --> 2:52:50.480]  one of my shoelaces off right now. Don't let Bobby Wallace see it.
[2:52:50.480 --> 2:52:54.480]  He'll think it's a noose. I could take this shoelace
[2:52:54.480 --> 2:52:58.480]  off and I could choke myself right now. I'd kill
[2:52:58.480 --> 2:53:02.480]  myself right now. So see,
[2:53:02.480 --> 2:53:06.480]  that's what not having knowledge is like.
[2:53:06.480 --> 2:53:10.480]  Of course, it's the opposite. You know, I know how to kill myself with a shoelace. What I'm getting at here is
[2:53:10.480 --> 2:53:14.480]  if I don't have oxygen
[2:53:14.480 --> 2:53:18.480]  for four minutes, I'd die.
[2:53:18.480 --> 2:53:22.480]  That's fact.
[2:53:22.480 --> 2:53:26.480]  If I don't have vitamin C for six months, I'd die.
[2:53:26.480 --> 2:53:30.480]  If I don't have water for five, six days, I'd die.
[2:53:30.480 --> 2:53:34.480]  See, but see, literally,
[2:53:34.480 --> 2:53:38.480]  the Democrats literally, on record,
[2:53:38.480 --> 2:53:42.480]  Lisa James, Soros, finding a stranger on New York, called for my arrest.
[2:53:42.480 --> 2:53:46.480]  She called for criminal investigations, which I can tell you they launched.
[2:53:46.480 --> 2:53:50.480]  I'll talk about it more in the future. And they literally
[2:53:50.480 --> 2:53:54.480]  said, saying
[2:53:54.480 --> 2:53:58.480]  that anything is essential is illegal. These bankers
[2:53:58.480 --> 2:54:02.480]  do not even
[2:54:02.480 --> 2:54:06.480]  want you to be able to say,
[2:54:06.480 --> 2:54:10.480]  put a rope around your neck and jump off a cliff.
[2:54:10.480 --> 2:54:14.480]  They want you to go, oh, you're not Fauci.
[2:54:14.480 --> 2:54:18.480]  You can't say you can kill yourself with a shoelace.
[2:54:18.480 --> 2:54:22.480]  Of course you can.
[2:54:22.480 --> 2:54:26.480]  Four minutes without oxygen, you are dead, dead,
[2:54:26.480 --> 2:54:30.480]  dead, dead. Five days without water on average.
[2:54:30.480 --> 2:54:34.480]  You're dead, dead, dead. Six months without vitamin C,
[2:54:34.480 --> 2:54:38.480]  dead, dead, dead. Six months without vitamin D3, dead, dead, dead.
[2:54:38.480 --> 2:54:42.480]  Six months without iodine, dead, dead, dead as hell.
[2:54:42.480 --> 2:54:46.480]  And these people literally are such a cult.
[2:54:46.480 --> 2:54:50.480]  They don't even want you to know that and know the food's depleted,
[2:54:50.480 --> 2:54:54.480]  and they want to arrest people that tell them that
[2:54:54.480 --> 2:54:58.480]  if you take 100 milligrams of zinc a day, you're bulletproof.
[2:54:58.480 --> 2:55:02.480]  Except your kidneys will fill.
[2:55:02.480 --> 2:55:06.480]  So that's how the universe works. There's stuff you can do and take
[2:55:06.480 --> 2:55:10.480]  that'll make you bulletproof of this, but none of that. So what
[2:55:10.480 --> 2:55:14.480]  is the best advice I've researched is 30 milligrams a day
[2:55:14.480 --> 2:55:18.480]  won't give you any problems, and you're almost bulletproof.
[2:55:18.480 --> 2:55:22.480]  You know, it's like herpes or something. People like only get that
[2:55:22.480 --> 2:55:26.480]  when they're run down and sick, then it pops back out. That's how it works.
[2:55:26.480 --> 2:55:30.480]  Just want this coming up. I got a few final things here.
[2:55:30.480 --> 2:55:34.480]  The way they wage war on reality, the way they try to dumb us down,
[2:55:34.480 --> 2:55:38.480]  the way they try to make us all superstitious about information is BS.
[2:55:38.480 --> 2:55:42.480]  And I'm done with it. They're right back.
[2:55:42.480 --> 2:55:46.480]  It's finally here. Introducing the new survival shield

[2:57:04.480 --> 2:57:30.480]  I hope you enjoyed this video.
[2:57:30.480 --> 2:57:36.480]  If you don't like the way I'm living
[2:57:36.480 --> 2:57:42.480]  you just leave this long-haired country boy alone.
[2:57:42.480 --> 2:57:46.480]  I told patrons that died today
[2:57:46.480 --> 2:57:50.480]  very sad Charlie Daniels.
[2:57:50.480 --> 2:57:54.480]  And also, I always mispronounce this, I'm a huge fan since I was a kid
[2:57:54.480 --> 2:57:58.480]  the spaghetti western guy that did everything
[2:57:58.480 --> 2:58:02.480]  for him.
[2:58:02.480 --> 2:58:06.480]  I'll let him do it in a minute.
[2:58:06.480 --> 2:58:10.480]  I'm joking.
[2:58:10.480 --> 2:58:14.480]  You talk about music that uplifts the heart,
[2:58:14.480 --> 2:58:18.480]  talk about class, that's the definition.
[2:58:18.480 --> 2:58:22.480]  People ask me, who's your favorite musician, favorite man?
[2:58:22.480 --> 2:58:26.480]  I think it's him.
[2:58:26.480 --> 2:58:30.480]  There are thousands of songs, almost every movie is him.
[2:58:30.480 --> 2:58:34.480]  In fact, we'll introduce Joe Salante coming up with Triumph.
[2:58:34.480 --> 2:58:38.480]  That's what I call it on the computer, it's kind of another name.
[2:58:38.480 --> 2:58:42.480]  But before we end this
[2:58:42.480 --> 2:58:46.480]  transmission with yours truly,
[2:58:46.480 --> 2:58:50.480]  let me hit some of this news.
[2:58:50.480 --> 2:58:54.480]  Video, black armed militia holds up white drivers for reparations.
[2:58:54.480 --> 2:58:58.480]  They were searched in Georgia
[2:58:58.480 --> 2:59:02.480]  and literally said we're here to kill white people.
[2:59:02.480 --> 2:59:06.480]  This is so stupid, ladies and gentlemen,
[2:59:06.480 --> 2:59:10.480]  as if a white person does something wrong to a black person, so then white people are to blame.
[2:59:10.480 --> 2:59:14.480]  That is the most idiotic thing, but let me tell you,
[2:59:14.480 --> 2:59:18.480]  the idiot followers in this are not loveless.
[2:59:18.480 --> 2:59:22.480]  But let me tell you, I've watched the leader of this militia of speeches, the guy is a New World Order Soros puppet
[2:59:22.480 --> 2:59:26.480]  by 1%,
[2:59:26.480 --> 2:59:30.480]  and imagine you come up to a checkpoint people have guns
[2:59:30.480 --> 2:59:34.480]  because you're white, they want, quote, reparations.
[2:59:34.480 --> 2:59:38.480]  Even though 2% of the South had slaves,
[2:59:38.480 --> 2:59:42.480]  most people immigrated here from Europe came after the Civil War, it doesn't matter.
[2:59:42.480 --> 2:59:46.480]  The idea that your grandpa did something wrong, your great-great-grandpa
[2:59:46.480 --> 2:59:50.480]  is crazy and it's just, it's nuts, because
[2:59:50.480 --> 2:59:56.520]  The people held up at this checkpoint have a lot better behavior than I would because if I pull up to armed men
[2:59:56.520 --> 3:00:00.240]  If the cops said give me money, I'd get out. I mean, I just
[3:00:01.600 --> 3:00:05.400]  Imagine if cops acted like this here. Go ahead and roll the audio. Here it is
[3:00:10.280 --> 3:00:12.960]  So you're in Georgia here come the armed men
[3:00:12.960 --> 3:00:21.960]  Of course this guy at the car is ready to kill all these people and he's got
[3:00:21.960 --> 3:00:48.960]  You're not scared at all. This is what's dangerous about this people are really asking for it
[3:00:51.960 --> 3:00:56.800]  I just told you what I want. What are you what are you at the question everywhere you go?
[3:00:56.800 --> 3:01:03.120]  You have been here to have a attitude but where's our reparation
[3:01:17.240 --> 3:01:21.060]  For you lose your life, I mean, I'm sorry. I'd be a bag of people. I
[3:01:21.060 --> 3:01:30.460]  Mean this this is what the left is trying to do to start a war and it's criminal
[3:01:30.460 --> 3:01:33.460]  So I'll tell Trump again took Carlson's right. I
[3:01:34.140 --> 3:01:37.180]  Get we don't want to give the adjunct props what they want to go crush him
[3:01:37.180 --> 3:01:39.180]  but you have to follow law and
[3:01:39.860 --> 3:01:45.420]  And and am I acting tough? I'm actually ashamed of myself if I if people with guns do that to me
[3:01:45.420 --> 3:01:53.900]  I'd go captain caveman. I mean, I got problems. Okay, so that's why I gotta have armed security now because they gotta handle this man
[3:01:53.900 --> 3:01:55.900]  I cannot deal with this man
[3:01:55.900 --> 3:02:01.820]  I mean, I don't care if it's a KKK black dudes Easter Bunny people then you're at it
[3:02:01.820 --> 3:02:07.580]  You're at a road with a gun saying you're gonna kill me. You're about to die or I'm gonna die. I
[3:02:08.700 --> 3:02:10.700]  Mean, it's just insane
[3:02:10.700 --> 3:02:18.460]  You don't see patriots in Virginia when we were there with 5,000 6,000 7,000 people black white old young out together
[3:02:18.660 --> 3:02:22.380]  We had we were we would you imagine if we had a Virginia rally
[3:02:23.900 --> 3:02:26.500]  Enrichment and we were threatened to take people's money
[3:02:29.780 --> 3:02:31.780]  It's disgusting
[3:02:31.940 --> 3:02:34.820]  But this is what Facebook has created
[3:02:34.820 --> 3:02:42.340]  This is what they allow this stuff. Can you imagine? Proud Boys is a multi-racial group promoting manhood
[3:02:42.340 --> 3:02:47.660]  They hate that but you're a bunch of black nationalist racists at people's car
[3:02:47.660 --> 3:02:50.420]  I mean, do those idiots not realize how much danger they were there?
[3:02:51.540 --> 3:02:54.100]  I'm surprised. I mean, I'm surprised they're not dead
[3:02:56.220 --> 3:02:59.060]  Because you want to flip my span a lot of people man
[3:02:59.060 --> 3:03:02.980]  You want to flip some switches, but I get it the patriots know they want the violence
[3:03:02.980 --> 3:03:05.100]  We're just holding back. I would have controlled myself too
[3:03:07.060 --> 3:03:10.780]  But the dude didn't says thank God the guys kids weren't the car
[3:03:10.780 --> 3:03:16.700]  I think if that guy had his kids in the car, but all I mean, it's just you can't only take so much saying you're about to die
[3:03:16.700 --> 3:03:21.740]  I'm about to die because I'm white and I'm driving down the road you racist piece of filth
[3:03:23.140 --> 3:03:25.140]  These people are idiots
[3:03:27.500 --> 3:03:29.500]  But they know the media is praising them
[3:03:29.500 --> 3:03:33.260]  You don't see those black racists out of the abortion clinic trying to save babies
[3:03:34.020 --> 3:03:40.500]  No, they're just out there because they're led by a dirty ADL operative or Southern Private Law Center operative
[3:03:40.500 --> 3:03:44.940]  I bet my right arm they are funded by those dirty criminals
[3:03:45.420 --> 3:03:51.140]  So instead of getting mad at these dumbasses that have been led like the Pied Piper to this thing
[3:03:51.140 --> 3:03:57.380]  I'm pissed off at the corrupt foundations the Rockefeller Foundation and the rest of these people
[3:03:57.380 --> 3:04:00.420]  And I'm sick of it and I just want
[3:04:02.140 --> 3:04:04.140]  The globalist to know
[3:04:04.260 --> 3:04:09.780]  If the civil war kicks off my target's not black people my target's you
[3:04:11.420 --> 3:04:13.420]  So get that through your head
[3:04:15.980 --> 3:04:18.900]  You think your private jets are gonna get you to New Zealand or Kauai
[3:04:19.700 --> 3:04:23.980]  Everyone hates you in Hawaii and in New Zealand. I get told everything about you
[3:04:23.980 --> 3:04:32.820]  You're your chefs hate you your security people hate you your children hate you we hate you and we're gonna get you
[3:04:33.460 --> 3:04:38.900]  So keep thinking you're in charge the minute you jump the minute you start your crap
[3:04:38.900 --> 3:04:41.860]  We're not gonna be out the street killing a bunch of dumbasses
[3:04:42.940 --> 3:04:44.940]  It's gonna be you
[3:04:45.460 --> 3:04:50.220]  And you know, I don't just say stuff, you know that mean it and you know it's true. You're dead
[3:04:50.220 --> 3:04:52.220]  You're dead
[3:04:53.820 --> 3:04:58.420]  That means dead that means not breathing that means blood running out your ass
[3:04:59.500 --> 3:05:01.500]  That's your frickin mouth
[3:05:01.540 --> 3:05:05.940]  So you keep pushing your crap you keep trying to activate all these mobs and all this BS
[3:05:06.100 --> 3:05:12.420]  You're gonna die just like Hitler and just like the frickin Japanese Emperor dickhead
[3:05:12.580 --> 3:05:15.180]  I'm gonna tell you one more time
[3:05:15.180 --> 3:05:17.180]  I
[3:05:19.660 --> 3:05:22.500]  I'm not gonna kill you you're killing yourself
[3:05:23.220 --> 3:05:30.940]  So you sit there and run your big fat new order miles and you sit up there in your stolen mansions with all your fake-ass money
[3:05:31.020 --> 3:05:35.900]  Just like David Rockefeller couldn't buy an eighth heart transplant just like he went to hell
[3:05:35.900 --> 3:05:43.260]  You are conjuring oblivion you are conjuring your annihilation
[3:05:44.860 --> 3:05:46.860]  And I get it so hey
[3:05:46.900 --> 3:05:48.020]  Good
[3:05:48.020 --> 3:05:53.300]  All I know is Hillary Clinton's gonna burn it out. Oh, I know that jack-o-lantern face pedophile is
[3:05:53.660 --> 3:05:58.740]  Is it's not better than me and she didn't intimidate me and I didn't bow down to her. I
[3:06:00.700 --> 3:06:02.700]  Don't give up. Let me tell you something
[3:06:02.700 --> 3:06:06.900]  You know something's taken over in four wars calm news wars calm
[3:06:07.620 --> 3:06:09.620]  It's time to decide who you are right now
[3:06:10.220 --> 3:06:16.460]  This isn't about pissing contests are acting tough these people are killing us right so you decide which side you're on right now
[3:06:17.100 --> 3:06:18.620]  forever
[3:06:18.620 --> 3:06:22.220]  As for me give me liberty or give me death
[3:06:23.660 --> 3:06:25.660]  Victory or death I

[3:09:38.300 --> 3:09:40.100]  families
[3:09:40.100 --> 3:09:42.100]  Respectful people came from North Carolina
[3:09:43.300 --> 3:09:44.660]  Americans
[3:09:44.660 --> 3:09:48.340]  Yep. Oh and a lot of them with
[3:09:49.140 --> 3:09:56.220]  Info wars t-shirts and that's one of the reasons I got so much pressure because I'm in liberal land up here and
[3:09:56.220 --> 3:09:58.220]  and
[3:09:58.260 --> 3:10:01.740]  That's why we love you if you weren't the Emmy wasn't attacking we know you're not good
[3:10:02.420 --> 3:10:07.100]  Yep, because I'm on info wars. You should you you would have no idea
[3:10:07.860 --> 3:10:14.100]  Alex the hundreds the hundreds the hundreds of negative responses
[3:10:14.100 --> 3:10:19.260]  We got up into the lead-in in this because I had number one
[3:10:19.260 --> 3:10:28.340]  I'm on Alex Jones show. I host an hour and number two. I had judge Napolitano here from Fox
[3:10:29.260 --> 3:10:33.740]  We asked there are a bunch of bullies. They attack everything
[3:10:34.620 --> 3:10:39.100]  They're not bullies. They're cowards. I agree. They don't fight
[3:10:40.380 --> 3:10:42.380]  They're not fighters
[3:10:42.500 --> 3:10:45.860]  We invited the people from black lives matter
[3:10:45.860 --> 3:10:52.540]  to give them the platform because this was do you look at the poster to unite for peace and
[3:10:53.940 --> 3:11:00.060]  To restore freedom and they oh, you've always been about unifying everybody. I mean, I would call you a real liberal
[3:11:00.060 --> 3:11:06.860]  I know you're not sick, but I'm all you take I'll keep interrupting just take over. No, no, no, no stay on because I want you to hear this
[3:11:07.260 --> 3:11:13.540]  He so they refuse to come on because of my association with you and Napolitano
[3:11:13.540 --> 3:11:15.540]  number two
[3:11:16.300 --> 3:11:18.300]  These morons
[3:11:18.620 --> 3:11:25.580]  It's not it's okay that I host an hour show on progressive radio network. That doesn't count
[3:11:26.540 --> 3:11:29.860]  So anyway, a lot of people we hear because of you and
[3:11:30.620 --> 3:11:33.500]  I want to read oh again
[3:11:33.860 --> 3:11:38.500]  We were getting bombarded with negative negative comments
[3:11:38.500 --> 3:11:44.500]  This is racist on and on the people that from the peace program
[3:11:45.020 --> 3:11:51.180]  We they backed out the band that we were going to have playing we had two bands
[3:11:51.780 --> 3:11:55.260]  one backed out an hour before the event and
[3:11:56.380 --> 3:12:02.500]  Again, you could see by the pictures. It was perfect. They were threatening to protest
[3:12:02.500 --> 3:12:08.340]  Stay with threatening on and on and on now one of the cowards showed up. There's Napolitano and
[3:12:09.460 --> 3:12:15.900]  How beautiful the setting is that's the crown garden on the most historic four corners in America
[3:12:16.100 --> 3:12:21.140]  where the siege of democracy was sown so they weren't going to stop me and
[3:12:22.500 --> 3:12:26.540]  We kept going on and on but here's what happened the next day
[3:12:27.180 --> 3:12:29.180]  This is in the newspaper
[3:12:29.180 --> 3:12:31.660]  The newspaper the daily Freeman
[3:12:33.180 --> 3:12:40.260]  Ulster County sees weekend spike in coronavirus cases and then under at that picture
[3:12:40.940 --> 3:12:47.020]  People gather mostly without masks in uptown Kingston Saturday at an Occupy peace rally
[3:12:47.020 --> 3:12:52.020]  They're saying cold is your fault when meanwhile black lives matter and if you're going to protest all day long
[3:12:52.020 --> 3:12:54.380]  But again anything that's pro-america can't
[3:12:54.380 --> 3:13:00.220]  That's right. So now the stupidity of this Alex is that
[3:13:01.420 --> 3:13:07.380]  That they say that the cases spiked you're ready to 20
[3:13:09.860 --> 3:13:13.940]  Making it seem like it was responsible because I had the rally
[3:13:13.940 --> 3:13:20.560]  Oh, it's the same thing like Trump had his Tulsa deal the next day they went record level because they did record testing
[3:13:20.560 --> 3:13:28.440]  Exactly, but not only that it takes what about 14 days for this thing to catch it
[3:13:29.200 --> 3:13:33.800]  And here's what they wrote Ulster County. So a 20 new cases of COVID blah blah
[3:13:35.400 --> 3:13:40.160]  Ulster County executives said recently blah blah blah and now they're concerned
[3:13:40.600 --> 3:13:48.240]  The county executive that a rally held in uptown Kingston Saturday to protest coronavirus related restrictions
[3:13:48.240 --> 3:13:56.360]  Imposed by government leaders could lead to even more cases in Ulster County Kingston in Ulster County now
[3:13:58.000 --> 3:14:03.080]  Alex we have a hundred and seventy eight thousand people here in
[3:14:04.680 --> 3:14:07.160]  Four months four months
[3:14:08.040 --> 3:14:10.040]  We've had 86 deaths
[3:14:11.520 --> 3:14:16.400]  Out of those 86 deaths and this is a hard fact
[3:14:16.400 --> 3:14:21.760]  Over 50% of them came from nursing homes
[3:14:23.040 --> 3:14:25.280]  So now you'd cut that in half, right?
[3:14:26.600 --> 3:14:32.920]  You have 43 deaths out of a hundred and seventy eight thousand people
[3:14:34.280 --> 3:14:36.280]  You have the grand total of
[3:14:37.480 --> 3:14:39.480]  0.024
[3:14:39.480 --> 3:14:45.560]  4% of the people he had died by the way, that's what the doctors found in California three months ago the same number
[3:14:47.120 --> 3:14:52.280]  There you go, it's like you have a better chance of seeing the Easter Bunny than to that. I mean this is
[3:14:53.920 --> 3:14:56.520]  So now they close down
[3:14:57.040 --> 3:15:03.160]  Oh, if you go back to the daily Freeman that paper and you go to today's picture
[3:15:03.840 --> 3:15:05.840]  the top story a
[3:15:05.840 --> 3:15:11.280]  A restaurant right across the street from here duos and a pastry shop
[3:15:12.000 --> 3:15:15.280]  out of business got it
[3:15:16.040 --> 3:15:19.240]  Got it clown boys who closed down the society
[3:15:22.000 --> 3:15:24.000]  Got it
[3:15:24.280 --> 3:15:26.880]  People are going broke all over the place
[3:15:28.600 --> 3:15:30.600]  For what for
[3:15:31.960 --> 3:15:33.960]  0.0
[3:15:33.960 --> 3:15:35.960]  024%
[3:15:37.760 --> 3:15:42.000]  Cases with fake tests so now it's about death like all the record cases. Oh
[3:15:44.200 --> 3:15:47.240]  Yeah, the record cases add up to nothing
[3:15:48.360 --> 3:15:53.640]  Because when you look at the amount of how do you physically look at him? I literally when I see him
[3:15:53.640 --> 3:15:57.640]  I want to strangle him. I wish the arm against him. I just I can't look at it
[3:15:58.120 --> 3:16:00.120]  Well, you mean Cuomo
[3:16:00.120 --> 3:16:06.640]  Cuomo to all I mean just whatever. Oh, there's all of it. It's like it's like just they're up there
[3:16:06.640 --> 3:16:14.120]  Just it's like as soon as he finishes the press conference. He pulls the mask off. It's all a big joke. I know I know and this guy Fauci in jaw
[3:16:14.880 --> 3:16:20.040]  That's what Fauci means in Italian jaw a little jaw-boning little freak a
[3:16:20.680 --> 3:16:22.680]  Cuts on as we would call them
[3:16:23.920 --> 3:16:27.840]  Anyway, that's what's going on Alex the pressure that I had
[3:16:27.840 --> 3:16:35.520]  You would you would believe because you've had much of it. That's what I had. I saw I'm going I'm going ahead with this
[3:16:36.120 --> 3:16:41.200]  God bless you and I got and I got a crew of fighters around me. We have fighters and
[3:16:42.320 --> 3:16:45.480]  So that's what happened. It was a perfect day
[3:16:46.160 --> 3:16:49.520]  And by the way, you know what I started it off with the United Peace
[3:16:50.880 --> 3:16:52.640]  Reading
[3:16:52.640 --> 3:16:54.640]  Martin Luther King's
[3:16:54.640 --> 3:17:02.360]  Freedom speech, which all these little cowards forgot to unite black and white
[3:17:03.320 --> 3:17:05.240]  Jew and Gentile
[3:17:05.240 --> 3:17:09.400]  We're all in this together and these little boys and girls
[3:17:10.240 --> 3:17:13.080]  Are trying to destroy the freedom that we have
[3:17:13.840 --> 3:17:20.080]  But I won't let them you won't let them and the people that listen to info wars won't let them
[3:17:20.840 --> 3:17:22.840]  we had a
[3:17:22.840 --> 3:17:29.200]  Freedom fest the independence day beautiful stay there. You're gonna take over. I was talking erupting
[3:17:29.360 --> 3:17:33.760]  Gerald Salante takes over on the other side of this quick break. Somebody, you know, tune in right now
[3:17:33.760 --> 3:17:37.760]  This is very important information. How dare him put Martin Luther King. That's racist
[3:17:37.760 --> 3:17:42.000]  Sisters are saying what I was privately saying the crew last night
[3:17:42.560 --> 3:17:48.120]  We may have just broken not just the biggest story in info wars history, but one of the biggest stories period
[3:17:48.520 --> 3:17:50.880]  the state of Texas confirms that
[3:17:50.880 --> 3:17:52.880]  the CDC and NIH
[3:17:53.520 --> 3:17:59.040]  Have created a system where anyone that has the sore throat or a runny nose
[3:17:59.520 --> 3:18:02.320]  Or who has been in contact with someone covered 19
[3:18:02.760 --> 3:18:08.240]  He's been added into the database as having a case and is counted as a case of COVID-19
[3:18:08.240 --> 3:18:13.120]  It's in the NIH documents. It's at the state level. We confirmed it in Texas. We're not confirming
[3:18:13.120 --> 3:18:14.120]  It's in other states
[3:18:14.120 --> 3:18:20.920]  This is beyond the other smoking guns of them putting people to die a gunshot wounds and stuff in the covid column and the
[3:18:21.280 --> 3:18:25.560]  False positive test. That's all huge. This is beyond that mega
[3:18:26.160 --> 3:18:27.720]  criminal activity
[3:18:27.720 --> 3:18:34.520]  And we've got these ever county commission videos where they're just freaking out over it saying what in the world is this the full video

[3:21:03.440 --> 3:21:05.440]  Is 1776
[3:21:05.440 --> 3:21:11.440]  You're listening to the alex jones show with jerald solente
[3:21:13.520 --> 3:21:16.160]  Hello, hello creeping on the alex jones show

[3:21:22.960 --> 3:21:24.960]  Judge napolitano
[3:21:25.040 --> 3:21:26.240]  was
[3:21:26.240 --> 3:21:28.880]  Excellent is excellent. What a man
[3:21:29.520 --> 3:21:32.400]  What a guy and he was he was just
[3:21:33.120 --> 3:21:34.880]  perfect perfect
[3:21:34.880 --> 3:21:37.840]  As were some of the others most of them
[3:21:38.640 --> 3:21:39.920]  all of them
[3:21:39.920 --> 3:21:41.920]  and the music food
[3:21:42.800 --> 3:21:47.360]  It was a spectacular spectacular time. You see that tree standing in front of
[3:21:47.920 --> 3:21:52.480]  That that's a ginkgo tree. That's about uh, whoof gigantic
[3:21:53.040 --> 3:21:55.760]  Again, this is the most historic four corners in america
[3:21:56.480 --> 3:21:59.200]  And you can see we red-whited and blew this place
[3:22:00.160 --> 3:22:03.600]  All over made it as beautiful as we could possibly make it
[3:22:03.600 --> 3:22:07.840]  The american flags hanging everywhere peace and freedom
[3:22:08.400 --> 3:22:13.200]  So they went on to say the event saturday sponsored by the organization occupy peace
[3:22:14.160 --> 3:22:19.200]  Through hundreds of people who turned out to protest the imposition of what organizers called
[3:22:20.000 --> 3:22:23.840]  draconian rules that destroyed millions of businesses and lives
[3:22:25.680 --> 3:22:30.800]  And as we showed you they destroyed millions of businesses and lives went right around the corner from us
[3:22:30.800 --> 3:22:33.600]  We are going into the greatest depression
[3:22:34.400 --> 3:22:36.560]  The likes of which we've never seen before
[3:22:37.760 --> 3:22:40.400]  In florida they locked down miami dade
[3:22:41.920 --> 3:22:43.920]  And how come? Well
[3:22:44.960 --> 3:22:46.960]  Because
[3:22:46.960 --> 3:22:48.960]  Well those uh
[3:22:48.960 --> 3:22:51.120]  Spikes went up the corona virus spikes
[3:22:52.560 --> 3:22:54.560]  Like great
[3:22:54.560 --> 3:22:56.560]  florida yesterday
[3:22:56.560 --> 3:23:03.680]  They counted 26 deaths excuse me 46 out of 21 million people
[3:23:04.560 --> 3:23:06.560]  You know what that adds up to?
[3:23:07.120 --> 3:23:09.120]  0.000
[3:23:10.880 --> 3:23:12.880]  2 6%
[3:23:14.560 --> 3:23:22.320]  It's up. Oh, you don't care that people died of course like people die. You got it. We don't live forever. Could you imagine that?
[3:23:22.320 --> 3:23:28.320]  Again the viruses again, you see it 46 deaths
[3:23:29.760 --> 3:23:31.760]  out of how many people
[3:23:33.200 --> 3:23:35.200]  21 million
[3:23:35.520 --> 3:23:39.600]  And this is the headline news non stop
[3:23:40.240 --> 3:23:44.000]  They keep pushing it out pushing it out and here we go
[3:23:46.240 --> 3:23:48.240]  To date some
[3:23:48.240 --> 3:23:59.680]  43 people in miami dade county over the past four months in a population of 2,745,000 died of the virus or
[3:24:00.880 --> 3:24:04.400]  0.04 percent of the population
[3:24:05.520 --> 3:24:07.520]  And we go on to write
[3:24:07.680 --> 3:24:10.320]  A fact totally ignored by the fear-mongering
[3:24:11.280 --> 3:24:13.280]  prostitutes
[3:24:13.280 --> 3:24:18.560]  And absent in the coverage of the facts of who is dying from the virus
[3:24:19.040 --> 3:24:26.960]  Are they elderly and nursing homes? Are they people suffering from pre-existing chronic diseases? Obesity type 2 diabetics, etc
[3:24:28.160 --> 3:24:32.640]  But again overall 99.96 of the population
[3:24:33.360 --> 3:24:37.600]  Have not died from the virus is absent from the mainstream news media
[3:24:37.600 --> 3:24:42.560]  And the fact that millions of lives are suffering emotionally and financially
[3:24:43.200 --> 3:24:46.240]  From the unprecedented economic shutdown
[3:24:46.800 --> 3:24:49.760]  And tens of thousands of businesses are being destroyed
[3:24:50.960 --> 3:24:52.960]  Are rarely discussed
[3:24:55.600 --> 3:25:00.720]  Arizona's governor closed down bars movie theaters gyms water parks
[3:25:01.760 --> 3:25:05.600]  On june 29th. They have to state official health officials
[3:25:05.600 --> 3:25:11.760]  Voice concern over 3,858 more cases of the virus
[3:25:13.280 --> 3:25:15.280]  reported the day before
[3:25:15.440 --> 3:25:17.440]  So far in a state
[3:25:17.600 --> 3:25:19.600]  Of 7.3 million people
[3:25:20.400 --> 3:25:22.400]  1,588 have died
[3:25:23.440 --> 3:25:27.360]  Which is the grand total of zero point is zero zero two percent
[3:25:29.360 --> 3:25:32.640]  This goes on and on and on
[3:25:32.640 --> 3:25:35.840]  How dare I jeral selenity
[3:25:37.440 --> 3:25:39.440]  Fight for freedom
[3:25:40.240 --> 3:25:42.400]  That the dictators are robbing from us
[3:25:43.520 --> 3:25:45.520]  And I also have to thank
[3:25:46.480 --> 3:25:49.280]  Neil Anderson may his soul rest in peace
[3:25:50.240 --> 3:25:53.120]  But generously contributing to occupy peace
[3:25:54.240 --> 3:25:56.240]  That helped us put this rally on
[3:25:57.280 --> 3:26:00.080]  And as everybody knows that does this
[3:26:00.080 --> 3:26:05.520]  This doesn't come cheaply. It costs a lot of money. You can see we had first rate everything
[3:26:06.320 --> 3:26:08.320]  Sound systems
[3:26:09.040 --> 3:26:11.040]  It was it was the top
[3:26:12.400 --> 3:26:14.880]  So do what you can to support info wards
[3:26:15.840 --> 3:26:18.400]  You better put start putting your money where your heart is

[3:26:24.400 --> 3:26:26.400]  We can beat them
[3:26:26.400 --> 3:26:28.400]  Ya cowards
[3:26:28.400 --> 3:26:30.400]  They're not fighters
[3:26:30.720 --> 3:26:33.120]  They would threaten the protest over here
[3:26:34.000 --> 3:26:39.280]  You have no idea. Of course, do you do a alex jones people have a very good idea
[3:26:40.000 --> 3:26:42.000]  Of the pushback we were getting
[3:26:43.040 --> 3:26:45.040]  Ya cowards
[3:26:45.040 --> 3:26:48.160]  They were saying things about me. They're totally untrue
[3:26:49.920 --> 3:26:51.920]  Accusations total lives
[3:26:54.480 --> 3:26:56.480]  You know why they don't like me
[3:26:56.480 --> 3:26:58.480]  You know why they don't like me
[3:26:59.360 --> 3:27:01.680]  Because I speak out for my freedom
[3:27:02.720 --> 3:27:05.280]  And when somebody tries to screw with me
[3:27:06.640 --> 3:27:08.640]  It's going to get ugly at the end
[3:27:10.080 --> 3:27:12.080]  You know that's salenti has a bad temper
[3:27:13.040 --> 3:27:16.400]  I told salenti to go screw himself in my own proper way
[3:27:18.480 --> 3:27:20.480]  And he doesn't like that
[3:27:21.200 --> 3:27:23.200]  And he tells me what to do
[3:27:23.200 --> 3:27:28.560]  And how to do it because if he doesn't it's going to get ugly. They don't like that
[3:27:32.800 --> 3:27:34.800]  So
[3:27:35.280 --> 3:27:38.480]  Do what you can to support alex jones
[3:27:39.600 --> 3:27:41.120]  info wards
[3:27:41.120 --> 3:27:44.640]  By those products this thing is going down big
[3:27:45.280 --> 3:27:47.280]  This is just the beginning
[3:27:47.280 --> 3:27:52.640]  They're flocking out of new york city
[3:27:53.680 --> 3:27:55.680]  Hundreds of thousands
[3:27:56.800 --> 3:28:03.920]  The place is a shadow over what used to be a lot of them are moving up here. So i'm saying oh jeez these
[3:28:04.800 --> 3:28:07.520]  Guttless little liberals. They're not liberals
[3:28:09.280 --> 3:28:11.280]  But they are fascists
[3:28:13.360 --> 3:28:15.360]  Fascists
[3:28:15.360 --> 3:28:17.920]  They're moving out. They're going to be coming up here
[3:28:18.960 --> 3:28:26.160]  again, we told you this trend when it broke out in the world in in the in the
[3:28:27.920 --> 3:28:33.120]  Trends journal that they were going to be commercial real estate
[3:28:33.840 --> 3:28:35.840]  Was going to decline rapidly
[3:28:36.880 --> 3:28:40.320]  Particularly in the densely populated big cities
[3:28:41.040 --> 3:28:43.600]  We said this in February
[3:28:43.600 --> 3:28:45.600]  March
[3:28:45.600 --> 3:28:47.600]  April may
[3:28:47.600 --> 3:28:49.600]  June july
[3:28:50.000 --> 3:28:52.000]  got it
[3:28:52.640 --> 3:28:55.200]  This isn't new news to subscribers
[3:28:56.400 --> 3:28:58.000]  We said
[3:28:58.000 --> 3:29:02.960]  You're going to see violence in protests like you haven't seen
[3:29:03.840 --> 3:29:06.640]  Probably since 1968
[3:29:08.080 --> 3:29:10.080]  And you're seeing it
[3:29:10.080 --> 3:29:15.760]  And again as I got criticized for holding this rally
[3:29:16.720 --> 3:29:22.400]  They're holding black lives matter rallies here two times a week
[3:29:24.160 --> 3:29:26.960]  Congregating in mass
[3:29:28.960 --> 3:29:30.960]  But no blowback against that
[3:29:33.280 --> 3:29:35.280]  Only against me
[3:29:35.280 --> 3:29:41.920]  Because I am opposed to having my rights and freedom robbed from me
[3:29:45.600 --> 3:29:46.960]  And
[3:29:46.960 --> 3:29:48.960]  When we come back
[3:29:48.960 --> 3:29:51.520]  I'm going to show you the proof of what's going on
[3:29:52.480 --> 3:29:54.480]  And how they're singling us out
[3:29:55.600 --> 3:29:57.600]  And letting the protesters
[3:29:58.000 --> 3:29:59.760]  Get away
[3:29:59.760 --> 3:30:02.240]  With anything they want to do
[3:30:02.240 --> 3:30:06.480]  Again the pressure that I get
[3:30:07.840 --> 3:30:10.720]  You're on with alex jones as you bet. I am
[3:30:11.760 --> 3:30:18.400]  alex jones is alex jones jaryl salentes jaryl salenti info wars is a platform

[3:30:32.240 --> 3:30:34.240]  And your mind is that small

[3:31:46.800 --> 3:31:52.080]  Mind control hoax new that once they got the public for several months to wear mask in social distance
[3:31:52.400 --> 3:31:58.400]  They would be able to permanently turn it on and off at any time they want by putting handcuffs on someone and then add
[3:31:58.880 --> 3:32:02.880]  New demands that people take force inoculations that they have contact tracing
[3:32:03.360 --> 3:32:06.400]  On their phones and that every aspect of our lives be controlled
[3:32:06.400 --> 3:32:09.600]  This is all complete and total preparation for world government
[3:32:10.080 --> 3:32:15.760]  Forced inoculation and complete enslavement of the human population. This is medical tyranny
[3:32:16.000 --> 3:32:20.560]  This is the little more indicates you end takeover. This is the end of civilization
[3:32:21.040 --> 3:32:27.280]  As you know it living in denial only empowers the enemy if you want to break free from this trance

[3:37:39.120 --> 3:37:41.920]  You're allowed to march in black lives matter
[3:37:41.920 --> 3:37:45.920]  And the toilet paper record and all these other ones
[3:37:46.800 --> 3:37:50.560]  condemn me and others for holding rallies to have our freedom
[3:37:51.920 --> 3:37:55.520]  And again the numbers don't add up of who's dying from the virus
[3:37:56.400 --> 3:38:00.000]  We do it in detail in the trends journal and just quickly
[3:38:00.960 --> 3:38:02.960]  When I was a youth back in
[3:38:03.520 --> 3:38:05.520]  1957 58
[3:38:06.960 --> 3:38:08.960]  They had the asian flu
[3:38:08.960 --> 3:38:10.960]  A
[3:38:11.520 --> 3:38:14.320]  Million people died try one million
[3:38:15.920 --> 3:38:18.420]  At a global population of three billion
[3:38:20.080 --> 3:38:22.080]  Today we have a population of 7.8
[3:38:24.000 --> 3:38:25.760]  Billion
[3:38:25.760 --> 3:38:27.760]  If the same percentage died
[3:38:28.080 --> 3:38:30.080]  That they died in 1978
[3:38:31.120 --> 3:38:33.600]  Excuse me 1957 1958
[3:38:33.600 --> 3:38:37.840]  We'd have 2.6 million people dead by now
[3:38:39.360 --> 3:38:43.360]  Not 550,000 out of a population of 7.8 billion
[3:38:44.720 --> 3:38:46.720]  So here's the toilet paper record
[3:38:47.600 --> 3:38:50.000]  Despite mass floyd protests
[3:38:51.040 --> 3:38:53.040]  New infections remain
[3:38:54.160 --> 3:38:56.160]  Down so far
[3:38:56.400 --> 3:38:58.400]  Oh, this was on thursday
[3:38:59.520 --> 3:39:01.520]  As they were condemning me
[3:39:01.520 --> 3:39:03.520]  About holding a rally
[3:39:04.800 --> 3:39:06.800]  Their rallies are fine
[3:39:09.440 --> 3:39:11.440]  Excuse me
[3:39:12.320 --> 3:39:15.520]  Epidemiologists braced for a surge of new cases
[3:39:16.240 --> 3:39:18.240]  Has not come yet
[3:39:18.320 --> 3:39:22.720]  We've been looking very closely at the number of positive cases every day
[3:39:23.440 --> 3:39:25.440]  To see if there is an uptick
[3:39:25.440 --> 3:39:32.800]  In a context of the protest said ted long executive director of the new york city's contact tracing program
[3:39:33.200 --> 3:39:35.200]  We have not seen that
[3:39:36.800 --> 3:39:41.680]  Another study involves a review of thousands of cases in china
[3:39:42.880 --> 3:39:46.960]  Found that only a single instance of outdoor transmission
[3:39:47.600 --> 3:39:50.800]  Wait a minute. They're saying that we can't be outside
[3:39:52.000 --> 3:39:54.000]  But they're saying here
[3:39:54.000 --> 3:39:57.600]  That they only found a single instance of outdoor transmission
[3:39:59.200 --> 3:40:01.200]  And lowlife andy qualmo
[3:40:01.920 --> 3:40:03.760]  Yeah, you know him
[3:40:03.760 --> 3:40:09.200]  The daddy's boy born on third base the arrogant guy along with his little brother christy boy
[3:40:10.560 --> 3:40:13.760]  Would be nothing if daddy was in mario qualmo the governor
[3:40:15.200 --> 3:40:17.840]  When the broke out in new york city
[3:40:17.840 --> 3:40:25.200]  Most of the people who went to hospitals were already locked down. They were from home not people outside
[3:40:27.760 --> 3:40:31.920]  This is deadly to be walking around in fresh air with a mascot
[3:40:33.200 --> 3:40:36.320]  It doesn't jump out of the trees or hide behind one
[3:40:37.360 --> 3:40:39.360]  It's not floating in the air
[3:40:41.440 --> 3:40:45.280]  Why are you wearing that mask if no one's around i'll tell you why
[3:40:45.280 --> 3:40:47.280]  Because we're a nation of cowards
[3:40:48.320 --> 3:40:50.880]  And we believe the little freaks that shove it to us
[3:40:51.520 --> 3:40:55.840]  Like these guys are doing with their shove balls that the people take and bend over and take
[3:40:58.000 --> 3:41:00.000]  Why are you doing this?
[3:41:02.320 --> 3:41:04.320]  Because we're cowards
[3:41:06.320 --> 3:41:08.320]  Other facts here
[3:41:09.120 --> 3:41:11.120]  In minnesota
[3:41:11.120 --> 3:41:17.280]  An initiative that targeted demonstrations found that 1.5 percent of them tested positive
[3:41:18.000 --> 3:41:21.760]  In massachusetts fewer than three percent of the protesters did
[3:41:24.960 --> 3:41:26.960]  These numbers add up to nothing
[3:41:30.640 --> 3:41:34.480]  They add up to nothing and as far as the face masks
[3:41:34.480 --> 3:41:39.520]  The world health organization
[3:41:41.840 --> 3:41:44.480]  And the census of disease control and prevention
[3:41:45.920 --> 3:41:49.120]  Were saying that only people that were ill should be wearing them
[3:41:50.000 --> 3:41:52.000]  And then they did a 180 on it
[3:41:53.200 --> 3:41:56.320]  And we know that the virus comes in through other areas
[3:41:58.720 --> 3:42:02.640]  So they're not as effective and how stupid can it be
[3:42:02.640 --> 3:42:04.640]  When people are sitting down
[3:42:06.800 --> 3:42:09.200]  And they're allowed to eat without a face mask
[3:42:10.880 --> 3:42:12.880]  But when you stand up
[3:42:14.720 --> 3:42:16.720]  You got to put your face masks back on
[3:42:18.400 --> 3:42:22.080]  This is total total insanity. So how dare I?
[3:42:23.360 --> 3:42:25.360]  Gerald Salenti
[3:42:25.920 --> 3:42:27.920]  A man born to be free
[3:42:29.120 --> 3:42:31.120]  Hold a rally
[3:42:31.120 --> 3:42:33.920]  To fight against the draconian
[3:42:34.800 --> 3:42:36.800]  unscientific laws
[3:42:38.000 --> 3:42:40.000]  That they have pushed down our throats
[3:42:40.400 --> 3:42:45.040]  And now you have it over there in texas too with that little abbot from abbot and costello
[3:42:45.440 --> 3:42:50.080]  Another little nothing boy like most of them are or nothing girls to be perfectly
[3:42:50.960 --> 3:42:52.960]  perfectly equal here
[3:42:53.760 --> 3:42:54.960]  Black white
[3:42:54.960 --> 3:43:01.280]  Red green good bad comes in all of them. You got that witness over there up in uh michigan
[3:43:02.000 --> 3:43:03.840]  again men women
[3:43:03.840 --> 3:43:08.480]  Girls boys black white save it good and bad comes in all of them
[3:43:10.160 --> 3:43:14.160]  America is turning into a racist state look how they're promoting
[3:43:15.360 --> 3:43:17.680]  That biden should pick a black woman
[3:43:17.680 --> 3:43:27.600]  I don't why I I don't care black white green yellow transgender upside down. I can care less
[3:43:29.520 --> 3:43:31.520]  Give me the best person
[3:43:31.760 --> 3:43:33.600]  How about that?
[3:43:33.600 --> 3:43:37.840]  How about biden will pick the best person possible to be vice president?
[3:43:39.600 --> 3:43:42.400]  That's why we have to unite for peace
[3:43:43.680 --> 3:43:45.680]  And to restore freedom
[3:43:45.680 --> 3:43:48.560]  The markets are up today some 400 points
[3:43:49.760 --> 3:43:51.760]  Gold is also up strong
[3:43:52.560 --> 3:43:55.120]  Because gold knows that the markets are of sham
[3:43:56.160 --> 3:43:58.160]  being artificially pumped up
[3:43:58.720 --> 3:44:01.220]  By the federal reserve and the gangster banksters
[3:44:03.840 --> 3:44:06.480]  This thing's going to go down like we've never seen before
[3:44:07.840 --> 3:44:10.000]  Travel's not going to come back
[3:44:10.000 --> 3:44:16.000]  The summer how many businesses rely on summer business?
[3:44:18.000 --> 3:44:20.000]  They're not coming back
[3:44:21.840 --> 3:44:28.080]  Restaurants closing down yelp says 53 percent of them won't be reopening
[3:44:29.200 --> 3:44:31.200]  You better prepare for the future
[3:44:32.400 --> 3:44:36.560]  By those products we're going to have brad stein and one of the great great
[3:44:36.560 --> 3:44:42.160]  Martial artists who very much admires my work
[3:44:42.720 --> 3:44:46.080]  Is going to be writing more about how to prepare for the in the trends journal
[3:44:48.240 --> 3:44:52.480]  And i'm a close combat guy i'm a fighter i fight for my freedom
[3:44:54.640 --> 3:44:56.640]  I don't get them fights to fight
[3:44:58.320 --> 3:45:01.360]  In close combat you only get in a fight to kill
[3:45:01.360 --> 3:45:05.520]  And i don't want any of that i want peace
[3:45:06.400 --> 3:45:08.400]  But you have to prepare for the future
[3:45:09.600 --> 3:45:11.600]  Info wars has the products
[3:45:12.240 --> 3:45:14.400]  The trends journal has the information
[3:45:15.360 --> 3:45:17.360]  And you have the heart
[3:45:17.440 --> 3:45:19.440]  United we stand
[3:45:19.600 --> 3:45:21.600]  divided we fall
[3:45:21.600 --> 3:45:31.600]  We're in this together happy couple of days after the fourth
