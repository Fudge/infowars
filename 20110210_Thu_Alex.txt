[00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.944]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[00:00:09.944 --> 00:00:11.525]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.525 --> 00:00:13.086]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.086 --> 00:00:17.270]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.254]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:22.254 --> 00:00:26.797]  It is February 10th on this Thursday edition, 2010, 2011.
[00:00:31.758 --> 00:00:32.624]  Still getting used to saying 2010.
[00:00:32.624 --> 00:00:33.228]  By the time I got...
[00:00:36.929 --> 00:00:42.890]  Away from saying 2009, 2010 was over, it's 2011.
[00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:52.113]  We've got Max Keiser joining us to get into what's happening with the stock market consolidations that are going on worldwide and some big developments there.
[00:00:52.113 --> 00:01:00.895]  And then the founder of Oath Keepers, constitutional lawyer and veteran, Stuart Rhodes, will be joining us in studio today in the third hour.
[00:01:00.895 --> 00:01:02.475]  So that will be extremely informative.
[00:01:04.557 --> 00:01:14.541]  You know yesterday Janet Napolitano came out on the heels of the House not reauthorizing on Tuesday the USA Patriot Act.
[00:01:14.541 --> 00:01:18.142]  They're going to try to re-ram it through sometime this week or next week.
[00:01:18.142 --> 00:01:21.063]  I've got a Campaign for Liberty alert.
[00:01:21.063 --> 00:01:22.463]  Dealing with that we're going to be going over.
[00:01:25.836 --> 00:01:29.757]  She came out and said, we're facing the greatest threat since 9-11.
[00:01:29.757 --> 00:01:31.878]  That we're at red alert.
[00:01:31.878 --> 00:01:34.059]  We're just basically permanently on red alert.
[00:01:34.059 --> 00:01:36.220]  And that the biggest threat is domestic groups.
[00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.860]  So, it's not men in caves now.
[00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.121]  It's your neighbor.
[00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:40.762]  It's people hiding under the table.
[00:01:40.762 --> 00:01:42.802]  It's people at Walmart.
[00:01:42.802 --> 00:01:45.223]  It's just the terrorists are everywhere.
[00:01:45.223 --> 00:01:54.347]  But since Sunday, on-air and off-air, we've been trying to call Homeland Security and report who Anwar al-Awlaki, who
[00:01:55.911 --> 00:02:00.141]  Even CBS News is reporting today is now the leader of Al Qaeda.
[00:02:00.141 --> 00:02:01.043]  It's not bin Laden.
[00:02:01.043 --> 00:02:03.268]  They're now saying he is number one.
[00:02:04.281 --> 00:02:19.113]  So the number one Al Qaeda leader reportedly and confirmed hanging out secretly at the Pentagon getting orders, and it's all hidden in plain view, and the Austin Police Department won't take my report, the FBI in Dallas won't take it, DHS in D.C.
[00:02:19.113 --> 00:02:20.253]  won't take it.
[00:02:20.253 --> 00:02:21.574]  They won't take it!
[00:02:21.574 --> 00:02:25.778]  Now, we know why they won't take it, but isn't it the law they've got to take a report?
[00:02:27.042 --> 00:02:36.227]  When I'm here trying to say, here's Fox News, Anwar al-Awlaki secretly dined and hung out with the top brass and the Secretary of the Army.
[00:02:39.264 --> 00:02:54.976]  Two months after 9-11, when he was on the news as one of the masterminds, and he's run the underwear bombing, reportedly, the Times Square attack, the Fort Hood situation, and then we're sitting here just accepting all of this fear-mongering.
[00:02:54.976 --> 00:02:57.918]  Janet Napolitano says, we're probably going to get hit soon.
[00:02:57.918 --> 00:02:59.019]  Give up all your rights.
[00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.460]  Tattle on your neighbor.
[00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:03.062]  Everyone could be a terrorist.
[00:03:03.062 --> 00:03:08.346]  It's like that movie, The Thing, the remake that came out in the 80s.
[00:03:10.213 --> 00:03:17.635]  Where nobody knows, you know, who the shape-shifting alien is there at the frozen outpost.
[00:03:17.635 --> 00:03:21.497]  And everybody's looking at each other, and they're telling us terrorists are everywhere.
[00:03:21.497 --> 00:03:24.197]  When you look at your neighbor, they could secretly be in Al-Qaeda.
[00:03:24.197 --> 00:03:27.238]  Meanwhile, we know Al-Qaeda is a globalist creation.
[00:03:27.238 --> 00:03:35.061]  And we know the globalists are using this as a pretext to take our liberties and clamp down so the offshore banks can further vertically integrate and loot the economy.
[00:03:36.235 --> 00:03:38.619]  And here it is out of CBS News today.
[00:03:38.619 --> 00:03:41.544]  Times Square mastermind, bigger threat than Bin Laden.
[00:03:41.544 --> 00:03:47.033]  Napolitano says American-born, and more Al-Awlaki, a serious concern.
[00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:48.275]  A terror power shift.
[00:03:49.332 --> 00:03:52.213]  Leads to a stunning warning from the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:03:52.213 --> 00:04:02.736]  The American-born cleric, who we know works for the Globalist, behind the attempt at Times Square bombing, has now eclipsed Bin Laden as the biggest threat to America, reports CBS News.
[00:04:02.736 --> 00:04:06.557]  See, and then Napolitano's telling us he's gonna, he's gonna get you.
[00:04:06.557 --> 00:04:09.838]  See, I know how to analyze the Globalist attack profile.
[00:04:09.838 --> 00:04:11.659]  Years beforehand.
[00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:16.420]  And we've been telling you, Tarpoli's synthetic terror book, out for six years, has been telling you,
[00:04:17.566 --> 00:04:25.194]  That it's Ammar Al-Awlaki is the master CIA controller of Patsy attackers that they go out and recruit.
[00:04:25.194 --> 00:04:33.222]  So they're not gonna go for high-tech staged events like 9-11 now where they gotta blow up Building 7 in front of everybody and admit they blow it up and then say, you didn't hear that.
[00:04:33.222 --> 00:04:34.524]  Abracadabra, go back to sleep.
[00:04:36.384 --> 00:04:49.596]  By the way, it's now come out and confirmed our original analysis that it is the power plant shutdowns that caused the blackouts, not 50 malfunctions at power plants as the White House lied last Friday.
[00:04:49.596 --> 00:04:51.718]  Pray for us, folks.
[00:04:51.718 --> 00:04:55.202]  We're under serious globalist microscope right now.
[00:04:55.202 --> 00:04:57.584]  We're going to break all of this down on the other side.
[00:04:57.584 --> 00:04:59.546]  Max Geiser and Stuart Rhodes coming up.
[00:05:00.407 --> 00:05:04.230]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.513]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[00:05:08.513 --> 00:05:13.236]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[00:05:13.236 --> 00:05:19.160]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:26.165]  Not worried about them moving south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:34.472]  I'm looking for America.
[00:05:34.472 --> 00:05:36.113]  Wear American and be proud.
[00:05:36.113 --> 00:05:38.714]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[00:05:38.714 --> 00:05:43.337]  The land I left free and the home of the brave.
[00:05:43.337 --> 00:05:47.599]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[00:05:54.901 --> 00:05:59.476]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[00:06:00.148 --> 00:06:04.691]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:06:04.691 --> 00:06:05.611]  Number 1.
[00:06:05.611 --> 00:06:09.034]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:06:09.034 --> 00:06:09.894]  Number 2.
[00:06:09.894 --> 00:06:14.797]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:06:14.797 --> 00:06:15.538]  It's true.
[00:06:15.538 --> 00:06:20.401]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:06:20.401 --> 00:06:21.241]  Number 3.
[00:06:21.241 --> 00:06:24.824]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:06:24.824 --> 00:06:28.506]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:06:28.726 --> 00:06:29.527]  Number 4.
[00:06:29.527 --> 00:06:32.271]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:06:32.271 --> 00:06:35.955]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:06:35.955 --> 00:06:36.756]  Number 5.
[00:06:36.756 --> 00:06:40.902]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:06:40.902 --> 00:06:45.668]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:08:00.631 --> 00:08:05.892]  Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents The Alex Jones Show.
[00:08:05.892 --> 00:08:08.173]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:08:21.681 --> 00:08:23.802]  It is Thursday, the 10th day of February, 2011.
[00:08:23.802 --> 00:08:28.625]  We're going to be here for the next three hours, probably four hours.
[00:08:28.625 --> 00:08:31.747]  I think I'm going to do the whole four-hour transmission today.
[00:08:31.747 --> 00:08:33.649]  Max Keiser popping in next hour.
[00:08:33.649 --> 00:08:41.514]  Stuart Rhodes, constitutional lawyer, former Ron Paul staffer, veteran, founder of Oath Keepers, will be in studio with us.
[00:08:41.514 --> 00:08:44.176]  And Mike Adams called and was going to be in town.
[00:08:44.176 --> 00:08:45.817]  I wanted to drop by some
[00:08:46.357 --> 00:08:48.319]  Superfoods for me because I guess he loves us.
[00:08:48.319 --> 00:08:49.681]  We love him too.
[00:08:49.681 --> 00:08:50.682]  So I put in a call.
[00:08:50.682 --> 00:08:54.687]  He hadn't called back 10 minutes ago about maybe having him in studio in the fourth hour.
[00:08:54.687 --> 00:08:59.492]  What a treat to hear he's in town and want to want to say hi to him.
[00:08:59.492 --> 00:09:00.733]  So that might be a surprise.
[00:09:00.733 --> 00:09:04.378]  If not, I'll probably just go ahead and do the fourth hour because we've got so much news to cover.
[00:09:06.192 --> 00:09:08.553]  You know, I talk about this a lot now.
[00:09:08.553 --> 00:09:24.941]  There have been times where maybe once a year in my 16 years on air that everything really comes together and there's so much news that it just shakes me to my very core how right we've been, how incredible this criminal takeover is.
[00:09:24.941 --> 00:09:31.984]  And in that criminal takeover is the strength that it's so brazen, it's so over-the-top that it blindsides people.
[00:09:31.984 --> 00:09:33.225]  But that's also the weakness
[00:09:34.145 --> 00:09:46.315]  of the system is its strength because it's so ridiculously corrupt and despotic that if we get people to be shaken out of their television-induced trance, that it's plain for them to see.
[00:09:46.315 --> 00:09:50.279]  If we can just get them out of their trance, then we can start reversing the situation.
[00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:52.040]  A lot of people are waking up.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.221]  Others aren't waking up.
[00:09:53.221 --> 00:09:55.603]  They're going into deeper denial.
[00:09:55.603 --> 00:10:00.948]  But the news here in front of me is just unbelievable.
[00:10:00.948 --> 00:10:01.929]  It is confirmed
[00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:28.945]  By the Texas Energy Commission, that yes, there were not mechanical malfunctions at 50-plus power plants, as the White House said, that federal energy policy in the last two years has stopped new plants from opening up in all of the states affected by rolling blackouts that are still ongoing every time these new polar cyclones come in, these blizzards.
[00:10:29.929 --> 00:10:37.433]  That are even affecting Mexico and it's snowing all in many areas of northern Mexico and 30 plus animals died at one of their zoos.
[00:10:37.433 --> 00:10:39.754]  I mean, it's really cold weather.
[00:10:39.754 --> 00:10:41.595]  Obviously, that's taxing it.
[00:10:41.595 --> 00:10:44.717]  But if they would have built the power plants they needed, it wouldn't be taxed.
[00:10:46.235 --> 00:10:50.477]  I mean, growing up in Texas during hot weather, we didn't have rolling blackouts ever.
[00:10:50.477 --> 00:10:53.078]  Growing up in Dallas, now they do in the summer.
[00:10:53.078 --> 00:10:56.380]  We didn't have rolling blackouts during cold weather, now we do.
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:04.284]  And we've got the Heritage Foundation, the list goes on and on, breaking down that yes, our analysis last week was correct.
[00:11:04.284 --> 00:11:05.985]  That's why the White House responds.
[00:11:07.327 --> 00:11:10.830]  I've done deep study, but it doesn't even take deep study.
[00:11:10.830 --> 00:11:12.591]  Now it's all out in the open.
[00:11:12.591 --> 00:11:27.081]  They're coming in with select interests, just like fascists and authoritarians always do, shutting down their competition, thus creating artificial scarcity and increasing profits and control of the insiders, like General Electric, who basically runs the White House now.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:30.981]  And here are the reports.
[00:11:30.981 --> 00:11:33.962]  White House lies on blackouts exposed.
[00:11:33.962 --> 00:11:46.869]  PresentPlanet.com and he's got the quotes here where it is confirmed the Texas Reliability Electric Council has confirmed that there weren't mechanical malfunctions.
[00:11:46.869 --> 00:11:49.390]  It was energy policy.
[00:11:49.390 --> 00:11:52.812]  Here's another report out of CBS News out of Dallas today.
[00:11:52.812 --> 00:11:54.773]  North Texas could see more rolling blackouts.
[00:11:55.951 --> 00:11:56.251]  I think?
[00:12:13.388 --> 00:12:22.377]  I mean, do you think I make a 13-minute video charging Obama with treason because I want to have some shocking headline?
[00:12:22.377 --> 00:12:24.139]  That's dangerous for me to do.
[00:12:24.139 --> 00:12:25.961]  I'm on the White House enemies list.
[00:12:25.961 --> 00:12:30.846]  But somebody's got to have courage and somebody's got to analyze their attack profile!
[00:12:33.416 --> 00:12:42.200]  Okay, their battle plans for us are stated, and I've watched their previous battle plans, globalist statements, be carried out to the letter.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:45.821]  We know to the letter what they're going to do.
[00:12:45.821 --> 00:12:49.583]  And we've had success holding a lot of it back.
[00:12:49.583 --> 00:12:50.623]  I'm getting chills right now.
[00:12:50.623 --> 00:12:56.266]  I can't believe it's this corrupt, it's this bad.
[00:12:56.266 --> 00:12:59.027]  The White House announced massive
[00:13:00.017 --> 00:13:01.418]  Closures?
[00:13:01.418 --> 00:13:02.259]  Energy Secretary?
[00:13:02.259 --> 00:13:09.205]  I mean, but then they put out a press release saying we're liars when we said the exact same thing.
[00:13:09.205 --> 00:13:11.546]  They've already shut a bunch down the last two years.
[00:13:11.546 --> 00:13:14.909]  Now they're saying massive shutdowns.
[00:13:14.909 --> 00:13:22.475]  Energy prices are skyrocketing, not just because of dollar devaluation, but because we don't have the power plants we need.
[00:13:22.475 --> 00:13:24.937]  And now they're getting us ready for blackouts.
[00:13:24.937 --> 00:13:26.318]  You know, the same thing happened
[00:13:27.284 --> 00:13:31.845]  Back in 99, 2000, 2001.
[00:13:31.845 --> 00:13:34.805]  And it later came out in federal and state court.
[00:13:34.805 --> 00:13:37.166]  You pull it up in the LA Times.
[00:13:37.166 --> 00:13:40.646]  Enron staged blackouts in the West.
[00:13:40.646 --> 00:13:41.686]  That should get it for you.
[00:13:41.686 --> 00:13:43.587]  If you want to read it, we covered it here at the time.
[00:13:43.587 --> 00:13:45.227]  It was big news.
[00:13:45.227 --> 00:13:50.088]  And their internal memos that came out in court said, well, people don't like to pay more for energy.
[00:13:50.088 --> 00:13:55.689]  But if we stage a lot of blackouts, then that creates the perception of power shortages
[00:13:56.529 --> 00:13:59.210]  And then we can double, triple charge.
[00:13:59.210 --> 00:14:10.994]  I mean, some days in California alone, Enron was making two, three billion dollars extra just off jacking up prices, saying, well, your per kilowatt hour has now gone way up.
[00:14:13.311 --> 00:14:20.455]  And Enron, of course, was a drug-running, money-laundering, offshore shell corporation.
[00:14:20.455 --> 00:14:22.136]  No one can deny that now.
[00:14:22.136 --> 00:14:25.478]  Back then, it was the smartest guys in the room.
[00:14:25.478 --> 00:14:26.798]  All hail them.
[00:14:26.798 --> 00:14:27.419]  They're great.
[00:14:27.419 --> 00:14:32.642]  So I've been studying this energy situation since then and how it ties into the carbon tax movement.
[00:14:32.642 --> 00:14:36.724]  Who wrote the original carbon tax plan in 1995?
[00:14:36.724 --> 00:14:42.467]  Who had scores of meetings at the White House headed up by Al Gore as the point man, Bill Clinton attending?
[00:14:43.723 --> 00:14:44.724]  Enron.
[00:14:44.724 --> 00:14:52.730]  Enron with Dutch Royal Shell and BP had meetings and this is Ken Lay.
[00:14:52.730 --> 00:15:00.195]  And Ken Lay reportedly died two days before he was supposed to show up for his imprisonment.
[00:15:00.195 --> 00:15:03.278]  If you believe that, I got a bridge I'll sell you.
[00:15:03.278 --> 00:15:08.201]  But voila!
[00:15:08.201 --> 00:15:08.722]  Ken Lay
[00:15:10.549 --> 00:15:16.394]  A decade after his scams were exposed is still visiting wrath upon us.
[00:15:16.394 --> 00:15:21.698]  And I'm going to be going over all of that today.
[00:15:21.698 --> 00:15:23.399]  I mean, that's just off the chart.
[00:15:23.399 --> 00:15:25.901]  I could spend three hours on that.
[00:15:25.901 --> 00:15:29.944]  This other issue is, frankly, even bigger.
[00:15:29.944 --> 00:15:36.229]  And it ties together with Janet Napolitano saying we're under the greatest threat since 9-11.
[00:15:36.229 --> 00:15:40.232]  And she said Anwar al-Awlaki is about to hit us and hit us hard.
[00:15:40.532 --> 00:15:41.953]  He is now the new Bin Laden.
[00:15:41.953 --> 00:15:44.495]  Now, I've seen them over the years getting him ready for that.
[00:15:44.495 --> 00:15:47.498]  He was number three in Al-Qaeda on 9-11.
[00:15:47.498 --> 00:15:49.800]  He was most wanted.
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:51.461]  He was all over the news.
[00:15:51.461 --> 00:15:55.364]  And he was secretly at the Pentagon running the entire operation.
[00:15:55.364 --> 00:15:58.326]  Fox News, Associated Press, that came out in October of last year.
[00:15:58.326 --> 00:15:59.307]  No one denies it.
[00:15:59.307 --> 00:16:00.668]  Of course, we told you six years ago.
[00:16:00.668 --> 00:16:03.511]  We'd proven by then that he was a globalist operative.
[00:16:03.511 --> 00:16:09.936]  And what he does is, he either connects via phone or cell phone to patsies through mosque in the U.S.
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:18.508]  And then the globalists stage an attack and then just arrest some moron and frame him.
[00:16:18.508 --> 00:16:24.514]  Or they go out and they actually, sometimes for years, it took him two years to get Hassan ready.
[00:16:24.514 --> 00:16:27.017]  And the government's tracking all the emails, everything.
[00:16:27.017 --> 00:16:28.198]  He thinks he's emailing a lot.
[00:16:28.198 --> 00:16:32.083]  He's really, that's just a cut out name for when he's talking to the CIA and the Pentagon.
[00:16:32.443 --> 00:16:32.683]  I don't
[00:16:47.964 --> 00:16:53.831]  You know, shot and wounded right at the time, with a brain shot, and from past operations.
[00:16:53.831 --> 00:17:02.240]  You know, they have the patsy ready, boom, they shoot him, then they go ahead and start shooting everybody else with a lookalike, and it's just how they... and that's all in Operation Northwoods.
[00:17:03.061 --> 00:17:18.300]  Uh, how to stage these things, how to shoot people in Miami, D.C., Maryland, and then blame it on the Communists, and then how to frame Patsy's, uh, it's, and they've just moved from saying Communists, now they've moved over to Anwar al-Awlaki and the Arabs.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:23.143]  And then it comes out in the news that the Muslim Brotherhood is run by U.S.
[00:17:23.143 --> 00:17:24.064]  intelligence.
[00:17:24.064 --> 00:17:24.364]  U.S.
[00:17:24.364 --> 00:17:27.627]  intelligence is implementing the takeover of Egypt.
[00:17:27.627 --> 00:17:31.170]  That doesn't mean that people don't have a right to revolt.
[00:17:31.170 --> 00:17:33.352]  The issue is, though, it was triggered by the globalists.
[00:17:33.352 --> 00:17:35.113]  They created the economic atmosphere.
[00:17:35.113 --> 00:17:38.456]  They boosted the food prices via IMF World Bank orders.
[00:17:38.456 --> 00:17:43.000]  And then once the atmosphere and the climate was correct, they triggered the revolution that was ripe.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.463]  Now they'll put their people in and they're saying Mubarak now may not stay until September.
[00:17:46.463 --> 00:17:47.404]  He could step down any day.
[00:17:48.064 --> 00:17:49.568]  Uh, Hazi Mubarak may step down.
[00:17:49.568 --> 00:17:55.299]  Ruling party officials suggest President Mubarak may meet protesters' demands as army monitors situation.
[00:17:57.074 --> 00:17:59.596]  So, that's what's happening on that front.
[00:17:59.596 --> 00:18:09.364]  But, as soon as I heard that they hadn't passed the Patriot Act Tuesday, I got on air yesterday and I said, get ready for absolute, total fear-mongering.
[00:18:09.364 --> 00:18:10.905]  The terrorists are about to hit us.
[00:18:10.905 --> 00:18:19.733]  And then, at the time I was talking, she was giving a speech before Congress, before the Terrorism Committee, saying, Amaral, Lockheed's here.
[00:18:19.733 --> 00:18:21.254]  He's got domestic people everywhere.
[00:18:21.254 --> 00:18:22.615]  It's homegrown terrorists.
[00:18:22.615 --> 00:18:23.536]  We're on full alert.
[00:18:23.536 --> 00:18:24.697]  They're about to hit and hit hard.
[00:18:25.646 --> 00:18:35.711]  And now they're rolling him out as the new Bin Laden, just like they did months before 9-11, showing everybody Bin Laden, saying he's gonna get you when he gets you, when he attacks you, give all your rights up.
[00:18:35.711 --> 00:18:42.974]  Big mommy government, big daddy government, big brother government is gonna, you know, give baby a little sugar lollipop to keep you safe.
[00:18:42.974 --> 00:18:50.938]  You just fly that American flag out front your house and keep your mouth shut and let us give up, you know, all of your freedoms and everything will be fine.
[00:18:52.012 --> 00:18:58.555]  And that's why we keep hammering the point that Ammar al-Awlaki is admittedly run out of the Pentagon.
[00:18:58.555 --> 00:18:59.736]  And this is a big issue!
[00:18:59.736 --> 00:19:08.680]  So I call the newspapers about it, I call Homeland Security, and I say, look, here's Fox News, here's AP, here's news about Ammar al-Awlaki.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:11.581]  Pentagon documents leaked, the Pentagon doesn't deny it.
[00:19:11.581 --> 00:19:14.322]  This guy supposedly ran 9-11 with bin Laden.
[00:19:14.322 --> 00:19:15.523]  He's running all these other attacks.
[00:19:16.463 --> 00:19:20.746]  And, uh, we know the government helped get the underwear bomber on the plane and protected him.
[00:19:20.746 --> 00:19:21.806]  That's now confirmed.
[00:19:21.806 --> 00:19:22.927]  State Department admits it.
[00:19:22.927 --> 00:19:24.528]  This is all confirmed!
[00:19:24.528 --> 00:19:28.551]  And you're running these attacks, and I don't think the low-level people are, obviously.
[00:19:28.551 --> 00:19:35.255]  They're compartmentalized, and I'm there reporting it, and they just say, sorry, you can't report that.
[00:19:35.255 --> 00:19:36.796]  So, there you go.
[00:19:39.227 --> 00:19:45.193]  And it's a bridge too far for so many people that know 9-11's an inside job to come out and admit the truth.
[00:19:45.193 --> 00:19:47.155]  And so they're getting ready to stage a new 9-11.
[00:19:47.155 --> 00:19:48.816]  You can put that in your pipe and smoke it.
[00:19:48.816 --> 00:19:49.737]  You can take it to the bank.
[00:19:49.737 --> 00:19:52.820]  You can take it to the bank.
[00:19:52.820 --> 00:19:54.942]  They've got the internet kill switches in place.
[00:19:54.942 --> 00:19:57.264]  They've got the radio TV takeover switches in place.
[00:19:57.264 --> 00:19:59.166]  We're gonna come back and break all this down.
[00:19:59.166 --> 00:19:59.526]  Stay with us.

[00:21:00.031 --> 00:21:02.434]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:21:02.434 --> 00:21:04.736]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:21:04.736 --> 00:21:07.959]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:21:07.959 --> 00:21:13.064]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:21:13.064 --> 00:21:17.269]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:21:17.569 --> 00:21:19.910]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:21:19.910 --> 00:21:22.791]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:21:22.791 --> 00:21:25.713]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:21:25.713 --> 00:21:33.316]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:21:33.655 --> 00:21:39.037]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:21:39.037 --> 00:21:41.877]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:21:41.877 --> 00:21:45.578]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:21:45.578 --> 00:21:46.639]  And I got news for you.
[00:21:46.639 --> 00:21:47.979]  You're everyone else.
[00:21:47.979 --> 00:21:49.480]  Invisible Empire.

[00:21:59.192 --> 00:22:01.433]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:22:01.433 --> 00:22:01.954]  February 10th, 2011.
[00:22:01.954 --> 00:22:02.714]  Gold opened this morning at $1358.70.
[00:22:02.714 --> 00:22:06.196]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1394.03, $697.02 for a half ounce, and $348.51 for a quarter ounce.
[00:22:06.196 --> 00:22:06.697]  That's $1394.03, $697.02, or $348.51.
[00:22:18.669 --> 00:22:25.992]  The Constitution and the Bill of Rights have been reduced to old relics politicians ignore, trample with their outlandish, overreaching policies.
[00:22:25.992 --> 00:22:30.274]  Your support of the Campaign for Liberty stands in the way of this insidious process.
[00:22:30.274 --> 00:22:31.434]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:22:31.434 --> 00:22:36.396]  I've teamed up with the Campaign for Liberty to offer the authentic proof quarter-ounce pure gold coin.
[00:22:36.396 --> 00:22:37.216]  For only $390 plus shipping,
[00:22:38.757 --> 00:22:42.279]  Midas will donate $100 to this incredible organization.
[00:22:42.279 --> 00:22:45.001]  Help fight big government by ordering your gold coin at 800-686-2237.
[00:22:45.001 --> 00:22:48.103]  You get to win twice by owning gold and fighting an overreaching government.
[00:22:48.103 --> 00:22:48.284]  Call 800-686-2237.
[00:22:48.284 --> 00:22:48.924]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[00:22:48.924 --> 00:22:52.386]  How well and how fast does heart and body extract work to improve blood circulation?
[00:22:52.386 --> 00:22:52.547]  Listen.
[00:23:04.995 --> 00:23:09.279]  My name is Ellis and I'm 66 years old and I live in Jacksonville, Florida.
[00:23:09.279 --> 00:23:12.663]  Two years ago, I was diagnosed as having clogged arteries.
[00:23:12.663 --> 00:23:15.726]  I had 70% blockage in one artery leading to my heart.
[00:23:15.726 --> 00:23:19.089]  They wanted me to go on Plavix, but I refused knowing the negative side effects.
[00:23:19.491 --> 00:23:27.904]  Heart and body extract is a unique balance, synergy and proportion of herbs reaching from head to toe at maximum absorption around 95% at the cellular level.
[00:23:27.904 --> 00:23:30.467]  Within the first month I felt a dramatic difference.
[00:23:30.467 --> 00:23:34.834]  The heaviness in my legs was reduced and within two months I felt completely normal.
[00:23:35.066 --> 00:23:39.268]  Your natural organic herbal formula for heart health is Heart and Body Extract.
[00:23:39.268 --> 00:23:43.471]  Heart and Body Extract comes with a 100% ironclad money-back guarantee.
[00:23:43.471 --> 00:23:47.894]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[00:23:47.894 --> 00:23:49.795]  Call 866-295-5305, 866-295-5305 for Heart and Body Extract.
[00:24:09.534 --> 00:24:17.198]  There is no question that we have made many important strides in securing our country from terrorism since 9-11.
[00:24:17.198 --> 00:24:26.663]  But the threat continues to evolve and in some ways the threat today may be at its most heightened state since the attacks nearly 10 years ago.
[00:24:27.643 --> 00:24:41.679]  In addition to the core Al-Qaeda group, which still represents a threat to the United States despite its diminished capabilities, we now face threats from a number of Al-Qaeda associates that share its violent extremist ideology.
[00:24:42.660 --> 00:24:50.448]  Among these groups, we are also seeing an increased emphasis on recruiting Americans and Westerners to carry out attacks.
[00:24:50.448 --> 00:25:02.060]  These groups are trying to recruit people to carry out attacks who have connections to the West, but who do not have strong ties to terrorist groups that could possibly tip off the intelligence community.
[00:25:02.941 --> 00:25:16.304]  They are also encouraging individuals in the West to carry out their own small-scale attacks, which require less of the coordination and planning that could raise red flags and lead to an attack's disruption.
[00:25:16.304 --> 00:25:28.767]  And then she went on in CBS News' reporting to say that Amir al-Awlaki has now replaced bin Laden, who we know has been dead for nine years, as the new commander of al-Qaeda.
[00:25:28.767 --> 00:25:29.867]  And hiding in plain view,
[00:25:31.434 --> 00:25:45.451]  He admittedly is working with the Pentagon secretly and running these patsies in every case, whether it's the underwear bomber, the shoe bomber, the Fort Hood situation, the Times Square situation.
[00:25:47.145 --> 00:26:00.833]  These people think they're talking to Anwar al-Awlaki and really they're being handled and supported and armed and then when there are other agencies or sections of agencies that find out what's happening and try to frustrate it, they're blocked from stopping it.
[00:26:00.833 --> 00:26:08.477]  When they're mentally retarded, and in the case of Muttalib that's clear, disheveled, looked drugged according to witnesses, didn't have a passport,
[00:26:10.107 --> 00:26:12.730]  He couldn't get his visa, so an unnamed U.S.
[00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:14.031]  agency told the State Department.
[00:26:14.031 --> 00:26:15.692]  The State Department put a press release out on this.
[00:26:15.692 --> 00:26:17.394]  They said, we're not going to get burned for this.
[00:26:17.394 --> 00:26:22.078]  The Undersecretary Kennedy came out and said, look, I was told by an unnamed U.S.
[00:26:22.078 --> 00:26:24.040]  agency to give him the visa.
[00:26:24.040 --> 00:26:32.827]  But then he didn't have the passport, so an American-accented, sharp-dressed man argued with the gate people, got him through security and on the airplane.
[00:26:32.827 --> 00:26:36.411]  We told you that two months before the State Department came out and confirmed it was true.
[00:26:37.244 --> 00:26:39.565]  Because we have the eyewitnesses, the Haskells and others.
[00:26:39.565 --> 00:26:43.286]  I mean, do you understand how dangerous this is?
[00:26:43.286 --> 00:26:46.927]  You got a Lockheed who they say is going to hit us and hit us hard.
[00:26:46.927 --> 00:26:51.728]  You got all these Democratic memos saying we need a big terror attack so people love Obama again.
[00:26:51.728 --> 00:26:54.169]  That will save us, just like Oklahoma City did.
[00:26:54.169 --> 00:26:56.549]  They are one inch from admitting they did it all.
[00:26:56.549 --> 00:26:59.450]  They're just out in the open like we're idiots and don't see what they're doing.
[00:26:59.450 --> 00:27:06.132]  Even Glenn Beck came out last year, we've played the clip, and said the government's getting ready to stage a new Oklahoma City and blame it on him.
[00:27:06.852 --> 00:27:13.355]  When he says him, he means what's known as the Patriot Movement that Glenn Beck is seen as one of the leaders of.
[00:27:13.355 --> 00:27:17.517]  Probably the biggest person out there after Ron Paul and then myself.
[00:27:17.517 --> 00:27:19.758]  But he's a doppelganger.
[00:27:19.758 --> 00:27:21.419]  He's a wicked clone.
[00:27:22.559 --> 00:27:25.281]  He's kind of a bizarro.
[00:27:25.281 --> 00:27:29.863]  The twisted version of Superman.
[00:27:29.863 --> 00:27:32.084]  I have to sit here and watch this.
[00:27:32.084 --> 00:27:36.527]  Michael Savage is saying they're getting ready to stage terror attacks because they telegraph it.
[00:27:36.527 --> 00:27:42.350]  Do I have to read all the White House advisor quotes about, if we don't have a new Oklahoma City or 9-11, we're not going to get our agenda through.
[00:27:42.350 --> 00:27:44.511]  We need an event so Obama can be our leader.
[00:27:45.489 --> 00:27:54.413]  And you saw him seize on the Tucson hoax, and blame it on talk radio and everybody, and say, shut up and do what I say, and he got a 15 point boost in that, though it's already gone away.
[00:27:54.413 --> 00:27:56.473]  They need a big terror attack.
[00:27:56.473 --> 00:28:01.215]  And right on time, when they didn't pass the Patriot Act, oh, a Lockheed's gonna hit us!
[00:28:01.215 --> 00:28:02.256]  It's the biggest threat ever!
[00:28:02.256 --> 00:28:05.097]  Oh, and we're like, a Lockheed works for you!
[00:28:09.793 --> 00:28:12.155]  And then here's the Associated Press today.
[00:28:12.155 --> 00:28:17.078]  Man says ex-CIA agent Posada gave him explosives for hotel bombing.
[00:28:17.078 --> 00:28:19.259]  Well, that's already come out in congressional hearings years ago.
[00:28:19.259 --> 00:28:25.803]  This guy under CIA orders, he's basically been pardoned by the bureaucracy and let out of a U.S.
[00:28:25.803 --> 00:28:31.046]  prison, blow up an Olympic team on an airplane.
[00:28:31.046 --> 00:28:32.547]  And he's admittedly CIA.
[00:28:32.547 --> 00:28:34.849]  And when they would do these bombings, they blame it on other people.
[00:28:34.849 --> 00:28:36.250]  That's what the globalists do.
[00:28:37.728 --> 00:28:48.374]  In an exclusive interview Tuesday, a Salvadoran man told the Associated Press that former CIA operative gave him powerful explosives and cash to carry out a 97 hotel bombing in Cuba.
[00:28:48.374 --> 00:28:56.278]  Otto Rene Rodriguez said that he was given C4 explosives and $2,000 by Luis Posada Carillas to enable the bombing of a Havana
[00:28:57.881 --> 00:28:58.782]  I don't know.
[00:29:20.026 --> 00:29:26.729]  And we've got Newsweek, San Jose Mercury News, with the reported hijackers trained at U.S.
[00:29:26.729 --> 00:29:27.110]  bases.
[00:29:27.110 --> 00:29:29.451]  And it's like, well, they were, but let's not talk about it.
[00:29:29.451 --> 00:29:30.231]  Oh, they did have U.S.
[00:29:30.231 --> 00:29:32.232]  government credit cards, let's not talk about it.
[00:29:32.232 --> 00:29:32.992]  Okay, the U.S.
[00:29:32.992 --> 00:29:38.735]  Embassy in Saudi Arabia was ordered to let them into the country when they were flagged as terrorists, but let's not talk about it.
[00:29:38.735 --> 00:29:43.878]  Oh, and what did the CIA tell the State Department to let them in back in 2000, before the attack?
[00:29:43.878 --> 00:29:44.218]  Early 2001?
[00:29:44.218 --> 00:29:47.680]  They said, don't worry, they're not really terrorists, they work for us.
[00:29:49.363 --> 00:29:51.006]  We got him right there!
[00:29:51.006 --> 00:29:52.409]  We're on the march.
[00:29:52.409 --> 00:29:54.934]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.934 --> 00:29:57.619]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:01.849 --> 00:30:05.851]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:30:05.851 --> 00:30:09.092]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:30:09.092 --> 00:30:13.894]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:30:13.894 --> 00:30:20.277]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:30:20.277 --> 00:30:22.518]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:30:23.038 --> 00:30:24.558]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[00:30:24.558 --> 00:30:25.839]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:30:25.839 --> 00:30:28.079]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:30:41.963 --> 00:30:49.246]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:30:49.246 --> 00:30:58.350]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[00:31:00.791 --> 00:31:04.373]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[00:31:04.373 --> 00:31:05.494]  It ended on June of 2009.
[00:31:05.494 --> 00:31:10.076]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[00:31:10.076 --> 00:31:16.019]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[00:31:16.019 --> 00:31:18.161]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[00:31:18.161 --> 00:31:21.202]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[00:31:21.202 --> 00:31:27.706]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[00:31:27.706 --> 00:31:29.487]  They both make fabulous investments.
[00:31:29.887 --> 00:31:35.231]  Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[00:31:35.231 --> 00:31:40.514]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis and you can't eat paper, stocks or metals.
[00:31:40.514 --> 00:31:45.898]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[00:31:45.898 --> 00:31:49.100]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:52.102]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[00:31:52.102 --> 00:31:52.862]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[00:32:00.227 --> 00:32:01.408]  A very wealthy U.S.
[00:32:01.408 --> 00:32:08.334]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[00:32:08.334 --> 00:32:10.896]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[00:32:10.896 --> 00:32:16.280]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[00:32:16.280 --> 00:32:19.323]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[00:32:19.323 --> 00:32:21.645]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[00:32:21.645 --> 00:32:27.890]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[00:32:27.890 --> 00:32:28.310]  In fact,
[00:32:28.590 --> 00:32:31.250]  Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:37.031]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[00:32:37.031 --> 00:32:38.672]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[00:32:38.672 --> 00:32:39.972]  I can't stress this enough.
[00:32:39.972 --> 00:32:42.652]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[00:32:42.652 --> 00:32:46.873]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[00:32:46.873 --> 00:32:51.494]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:32:51.494 --> 00:32:54.074]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[00:32:54.074 --> 00:32:57.115]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[00:32:57.955 --> 00:33:05.621]  That's endofamerica3.com From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones!
[00:33:25.126 --> 00:33:30.912]  On the power plants being shut down and triggering the lack of power we need, we've been proven completely correct.
[00:33:30.912 --> 00:33:32.674]  I'm going to be going over that.
[00:33:32.674 --> 00:33:40.662]  On the fact that you cannot call and get anybody to report suspicious activity or who's involved in the terrorism, we've proven that.
[00:33:41.590 --> 00:33:51.733]  It's all a hoax, just like they turned off the naked body scanners the day before Thanksgiving, Thanksgiving, and for several days after, so that we couldn't protest, showing that there's no real threat.
[00:33:51.733 --> 00:33:53.413]  They're not really trying to protect you.
[00:33:53.413 --> 00:34:06.636]  It's all political, training you to be a prisoner, to line up and have the government frisk you, to have federally funded checkpoints roll out across the country as it's now happening.
[00:34:06.636 --> 00:34:08.477]  And it is just so incredible
[00:34:09.758 --> 00:34:14.602]  To now have the government come out right after the Patriot Act doesn't get repassed, reauthorized.
[00:34:14.602 --> 00:34:19.226]  It's been... Bob Barr put the provision in in 2001 to have it sunsetted every few years.
[00:34:19.226 --> 00:34:21.408]  They have to keep reauthorizing it.
[00:34:21.408 --> 00:34:24.711]  And we said, watch, they're going to run out and say Al-Qaeda's about to hit.
[00:34:24.711 --> 00:34:26.693]  They're going to say Amir al-Awlaki.
[00:34:26.693 --> 00:34:27.513]  And that's what they did.
[00:34:28.598 --> 00:34:33.022]  And we're just supposed to sit here like we're all morons, like we're idiots, and go along with it.
[00:34:33.022 --> 00:34:33.863]  Listen to this.
[00:34:33.863 --> 00:34:34.284]  Feds.
[00:34:34.284 --> 00:34:36.566]  Times Square mastermind.
[00:34:36.566 --> 00:34:38.008]  Times Square mastermind.
[00:34:38.008 --> 00:34:39.489]  Bigger threat than Bin Laden.
[00:34:39.489 --> 00:34:41.311]  Napolitano says American board.
[00:34:41.311 --> 00:34:41.931]  Al-Awlaki.
[00:34:41.931 --> 00:34:43.073]  A serious concern.
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:49.082]  See, we were talking about a Lockheed years ago when it wasn't cool, when nobody knew who he was.
[00:34:49.082 --> 00:34:52.684]  We know who he is, he's the new Bin Laden, and he works for them.
[00:34:52.684 --> 00:34:57.808]  A terror power shift leads to a stunning warning from the Department of Homeland Security.
[00:34:57.808 --> 00:35:08.454]  The American-born cleric behind the attempted Times Square bombing, and all those others, they don't tell you that, has now eclipsed Bin Laden, and is the biggest threat to American security, reports CBS News.
[00:35:10.658 --> 00:35:18.507]  And it goes on to break down that Anwar al-Awlaki is now the boss of all bosses of the group of Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula.
[00:35:18.507 --> 00:35:23.953]  The Fed said Wednesday he is now the number one threat, the most significant risk in the United States.
[00:35:23.953 --> 00:35:26.235]  National Counterterrorism Center Director Michael
[00:35:27.356 --> 00:35:34.942]  Lighter told the House Homeland Security Committee that American war on Bin Laden has allowed others to come to the forefront.
[00:35:34.942 --> 00:35:36.383]  Oh, it's a shadowy enemy.
[00:35:36.383 --> 00:35:40.266]  This former CIA guy, who's admittedly former CIA, Bin Laden,
[00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:43.832]  He's now faded off.
[00:35:43.832 --> 00:35:45.433]  Nobody's buying that anymore.
[00:35:45.433 --> 00:35:48.675]  Nobody's seen him on a new video for nine years.
[00:35:48.675 --> 00:35:51.957]  The government's been caught producing fake ones and admitting it later.
[00:35:51.957 --> 00:35:54.018]  That was admitted in the Washington Post last year.
[00:35:54.018 --> 00:35:56.240]  We already knew it, but they just admit it all.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.140]  Like we're stupid.
[00:35:57.140 --> 00:35:59.262]  Like we're not paying attention.
[00:35:59.262 --> 00:36:03.765]  Because they know the fetish they've created of getting into fearing Muslims all day.
[00:36:04.125 --> 00:36:06.307]  And I'm not saying there aren't radical Muslims.
[00:36:06.307 --> 00:36:13.553]  I'm not saying that there aren't people who want a new Ottoman Empire that they've been talking so much about.
[00:36:13.553 --> 00:36:17.075]  But, I mean, every big block of people wants to rule the world, okay?
[00:36:18.106 --> 00:36:27.835]  The issue here is that the globalists are running and financing the radical muslims so that they can take our liberties away domestically and bomb those countries into the stone age.
[00:36:27.835 --> 00:36:31.879]  And because the radical muslims will keep their countries in the stone age.
[00:36:31.879 --> 00:36:34.742]  That's the globalist program, the strategy of tension.
[00:36:37.199 --> 00:36:38.239]  I got a lot of other news.
[00:36:38.239 --> 00:36:46.061]  We've warned you for years about the dangers of diet soft drinks that have the genetically engineered E. coli excrement in it.
[00:36:46.061 --> 00:36:47.001]  That's what aspartame is.
[00:36:47.001 --> 00:36:48.922]  If you don't believe me, just search the term.
[00:36:48.922 --> 00:36:51.602]  Aspartame manufacturing process.
[00:36:51.602 --> 00:36:58.264]  It's a genetically engineered E. coli that they feed toxic waste to that then excretes out the toxin.
[00:36:58.264 --> 00:36:59.804]  And it's very addicting.
[00:36:59.804 --> 00:37:01.525]  It is a neurotoxin.
[00:37:01.525 --> 00:37:02.205]  But here it is.
[00:37:02.205 --> 00:37:03.425]  This is out of AFP.
[00:37:03.425 --> 00:37:05.446]  Strokes up among younger U.S.
[00:37:05.446 --> 00:37:06.166]  population.
[00:37:06.994 --> 00:37:10.396]  Yeah, so suddenly we're getting 25-year-olds getting Alzheimer's.
[00:37:10.396 --> 00:37:11.457]  And here's ABC News.
[00:37:11.457 --> 00:37:12.298]  Diet soda.
[00:37:12.298 --> 00:37:14.599]  Fewer calories, greater stroke risk.
[00:37:14.599 --> 00:37:19.162]  Controversial study linking diet soda to heightened stroke risk draws skepticism.
[00:37:19.162 --> 00:37:20.303]  Oh, yeah.
[00:37:20.303 --> 00:37:25.627]  We've just had scientists and brain surgeons on for years telling you the same thing.
[00:37:25.627 --> 00:37:27.568]  But, oh, we don't know why the strokes are way up.
[00:37:27.568 --> 00:37:29.670]  We don't know why all these disorders are way up.
[00:37:29.670 --> 00:37:32.071]  We're going to be getting into that as well.
[00:37:32.071 --> 00:37:32.292]  But...
[00:37:33.479 --> 00:37:40.384]  I wanted for the next 10 minutes to play the first 10 minutes of Fall of the Republic.
[00:37:40.384 --> 00:37:46.209]  I think it's a more important film, better done, more information than the Obama deception.
[00:37:46.209 --> 00:37:52.674]  But it's probably only been seen 15 million times for free online instead of 30 plus million times online for free like Obama deception.
[00:37:53.254 --> 00:37:54.234]  And it's up on YouTube.
[00:37:54.234 --> 00:37:56.115]  You can just search Fall of the Republic.
[00:37:56.115 --> 00:38:01.177]  You can get a high-quality DVD from us and purchase it and make copies and give it to everybody you know.
[00:38:01.177 --> 00:38:11.501]  We have it very inexpensive where you can buy them in bulk for like $4.95 apiece with the high-quality shrink wrap and the color cover and the expanded extras so people are more apt to watch it when you give it to them if you want to support us.
[00:38:11.501 --> 00:38:13.062]  But I don't care.
[00:38:13.062 --> 00:38:20.945]  The bottom line is get it out to everybody because the first 10 minutes of the film now made a year and a half ago
[00:38:22.162 --> 00:38:23.043]  We've got their pulse.
[00:38:23.043 --> 00:38:24.103]  We've got their MO.
[00:38:24.103 --> 00:38:25.164]  We understand their program.
[00:38:44.827 --> 00:38:47.529]  By getting the word out on what they're doing, we can stop them.
[00:38:47.529 --> 00:38:51.972]  You think they're going to be able to just shut off massive amounts of U.S.
[00:38:51.972 --> 00:39:02.079]  power plants if we speak out and point out what they're doing and that it's to shut down their competition, nothing to do with saving the earth from carbon dioxide?
[00:39:02.079 --> 00:39:07.963]  Do you think they're going to be able to get away with setting up domestic checkpoints if we illustrate that the terror is a fraud?
[00:39:07.963 --> 00:39:12.706]  You have the internal Homeland Security Mike reports that law enforcement sent us and that have been confirmed to be real.
[00:39:13.346 --> 00:39:18.632]  None of it has to do with the Central Asian cave dwellers.
[00:39:18.632 --> 00:39:28.284]  It's all about gun owners, land rights groups, anti-fellow reserve groups, libertarians, Ron Paul supporters, Bob Barr supporters, Alex Jones supporters.
[00:39:28.284 --> 00:39:32.989]  It's all about real Americans who aren't in a trance, who are awake and see what's going on.
[00:39:33.922 --> 00:39:37.745]  We've got to wake the other mind-numb zombies out of their slumber.
[00:39:37.745 --> 00:39:48.972]  We've got to do it now, but we've already got sufficient numbers that if all of you take action and get the word out and expose the globalists and the V for Victory campaign and we continue to push, we're going to win this thing.
[00:39:48.972 --> 00:39:53.735]  If not, they've got hardcore, systematic, scientific tyranny lined up for us.
[00:39:53.735 --> 00:39:56.717]  So I want to get into the power plant situation when we come back from break.
[00:39:56.717 --> 00:39:57.498]  I want to get into
[00:39:59.638 --> 00:40:05.241]  The fact that it has been proven to be a manifest hoax and a fraud.
[00:40:05.241 --> 00:40:11.585]  I'm looking for Paul Joseph Watson's article I printed in here to cover.
[00:40:11.585 --> 00:40:13.265]  Here it is.
[00:40:13.265 --> 00:40:15.987]  See something, say something, expose as a hoax.
[00:40:15.987 --> 00:40:25.072]  That's Paul Watson's article on it and it has the video posted, the compilation we put together of our calls Sunday and yesterday, live on air to Homeland Security, FBI, you name it.
[00:40:26.770 --> 00:40:33.874]  We then also have Kurt Nimmo's excellent article that covers other angles Alex Jones exposes, See Something, Say Something, as patent fraud.
[00:40:33.874 --> 00:40:41.178]  That special video report is up on PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[00:40:41.178 --> 00:40:53.144]  It's a 24-minute report that you need to get out to everybody you know so they get the full spectrum understanding of how you try to report terror and you can't because this is a non-existent, made-up, synthetic, manufactured system.
[00:40:54.428 --> 00:41:00.251]  I'm actually pulling it up here so you can get the actual headline video.
[00:41:00.251 --> 00:41:02.593]  Alex Jones Exposes DHS Terror Fraud.
[00:41:02.593 --> 00:41:03.794]  Get that out to everybody.
[00:41:03.794 --> 00:41:13.699]  But let's go to about nine minutes as we go to break from the intro through the first nine minutes of my seminal film, Fall of the Republic.
[00:41:13.699 --> 00:41:15.140]  You just type that into a search engine.
[00:41:15.140 --> 00:41:16.281]  The video's the number one link.
[00:41:17.312 --> 00:41:27.118]  You know, it's not Gibbons, Rise and Decline of the Roman Empire, or Rise and Fall of the Third Reich, or the Star Wars book, Fall of the Republic.
[00:41:27.118 --> 00:41:29.140]  It is our film, Fall of the Republic.
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:30.821]  Let's go ahead and play this important video.
[00:41:39.301 --> 00:41:50.189]  Last week, the head of the country's central bank floated the idea of dumping the greenback as the world's reserve currency, replacing it with an international currency.
[00:41:50.189 --> 00:41:57.135]  Thousands of people gathered to hear Barack Obama deliver key foreign policy speech on his current European tour.
[00:41:57.135 --> 00:42:00.697]  His vision for America's place in a new world order.
[00:42:00.697 --> 00:42:04.000]  Returning vets could be a risk to our nation.
[00:42:05.785 --> 00:42:11.407]  We've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I think all of us would like to see.
[00:42:11.407 --> 00:42:16.269]  And one of the ways it will drive the change is through global governance.
[00:42:16.269 --> 00:42:18.530]  I think a new world order is emerging.
[00:42:18.530 --> 00:42:29.014]  This is a hoax and a scam which is designed to transfer wealth and power from the private sector to the government sector and from the government of the United States to a world government.
[00:42:29.714 --> 00:42:35.559]  And those people who have been yelling, oh, the UN's going to take over, global... Conspiracy theorists.
[00:42:35.559 --> 00:42:38.262]  They've been crazy, but now they're right.
[00:42:38.262 --> 00:42:39.863]  And who got the money?
[00:42:39.863 --> 00:42:41.044]  Hundreds and hundreds of banks.
[00:42:41.044 --> 00:42:46.589]  Any bank that has access to the US Federal Reserve's discount... Tell us who they are.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:48.020]  No.
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:49.041]  You know, financial terrorism.
[00:42:49.041 --> 00:42:50.923]  They have the ability to tweak the knob.
[00:42:50.923 --> 00:42:55.006]  I am proposing that the Federal Reserve be granted new authority.
[00:42:55.006 --> 00:43:01.612]  The ultimate goal of the carbon tax and the cap-and-trade is to destroy production.
[00:43:01.612 --> 00:43:06.536]  This energy tax is the largest tax increase in American history.
[00:43:06.536 --> 00:43:08.657]  We're actually creating a global warming police.
[00:43:08.657 --> 00:43:13.722]  So number one, they can come in, the federal government can come in and inspect your house and send you the bill.
[00:43:13.722 --> 00:43:16.324]  We're setting up a global warming Gestapo.
[00:43:17.805 --> 00:43:28.047]  One of the things that if you talk to our generals, they are desperate for is a civilian counterpart to our military forces.
[00:43:28.047 --> 00:43:30.967]  I am fierce.
[00:43:30.967 --> 00:43:35.368]  And this is what I wear.
[00:43:35.368 --> 00:43:43.390]  Senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign is asking Missouri law enforcement to target anyone who lies or runs a misleading television ad.
[00:43:43.390 --> 00:43:44.310]  I've now been in 50
[00:43:45.972 --> 00:43:47.154]  Seven states.
[00:43:47.154 --> 00:43:48.495]  I think one left to go.
[00:43:48.495 --> 00:43:52.620]  The president, when he was in Europe last week, he met with the king of Saudi Arabia.
[00:43:52.620 --> 00:43:54.322]  He appeared to bomb.
[00:43:54.322 --> 00:43:57.346]  President Obama today proposed something new.
[00:43:57.346 --> 00:44:00.189]  Something called prolonged detention.
[00:44:00.189 --> 00:44:05.736]  Pre-crime is where people are arrested and incarcerated to prevent crimes that they have not yet committed.
[00:44:22.441 --> 00:44:25.022]  It's the World Wrestling Federation.
[00:44:25.022 --> 00:44:27.663]  It's the Washington Wrestling Federation.
[00:44:27.663 --> 00:44:30.805]  They put on this show that they're bitter rivalries.
[00:44:30.805 --> 00:44:32.445]  You know, villains.
[00:44:32.445 --> 00:44:34.586]  And they really don't like each other.
[00:44:34.586 --> 00:44:38.708]  But behind closed doors, they buddy up for a drink and make deals.
[00:44:38.708 --> 00:44:45.711]  Both the Republican and Democratic parties are owned by the same global elites.
[00:44:45.711 --> 00:44:49.533]  And on issues that matter to those global elites,
[00:44:50.563 --> 00:44:52.645]  They act as one.
[00:44:52.645 --> 00:45:10.180]  They've wrapped themselves in the American flag, and they've talked about preserving American heritage and principles, and all the while, they're working to merge us into a new world order where our sovereignty will be destroyed, we'll lose all connection with our American heritage.
[00:45:10.782 --> 00:45:14.123]  With Bush, you do exactly what you were getting.
[00:45:14.123 --> 00:45:18.404]  There was no iron fist in a velvet glove.
[00:45:18.404 --> 00:45:19.885]  It was just the iron fist.
[00:45:19.885 --> 00:45:23.666]  Whereas with Obama, you've got the velvet glove and the iron fist.
[00:45:23.666 --> 00:45:28.567]  You know, a very sharp guy, very smooth, knows exactly what he's doing.
[00:45:28.567 --> 00:45:30.688]  For that reason, far more dangerous than Bush.
[00:45:32.128 --> 00:45:36.870]  Well, at the end of last year, I was willing to give Obama the benefit of the doubt.
[00:45:36.870 --> 00:45:40.192]  I thought it was premature to write this guy off.
[00:45:40.192 --> 00:45:46.455]  But now that he's been in office for a while, it's obvious that he is very tight with the Goldman Sachs and J.P.
[00:45:46.455 --> 00:45:55.200]  Morgans on Wall Street, and he is extremely compliant and pliant to the wishes of the large banks.
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:59.362]  Going back to what we saw with Robert Rubin under the Clinton administration,
[00:46:00.163 --> 00:46:02.404]  Changing laws in favor of the banks.
[00:46:02.404 --> 00:46:04.265]  And he's not doing anything to stop the banks.
[00:46:04.265 --> 00:46:07.767]  He's helping the banks continue to do what they were doing under Bush.
[00:46:07.767 --> 00:46:15.952]  So in fact he's just a continuation of Bush on the subject of markets and finance, which is the most important part of his policy right now.
[00:46:15.952 --> 00:46:25.877]  People who voted for Obama wanted real change and are getting platitudes, are getting a lot of nice talk, but nothing in the way of concrete change is taking place.
[00:46:25.877 --> 00:46:27.618]  In this town, business as usual.
[00:46:28.001 --> 00:46:35.867]  There's one puppet master that controls the left, and the same puppet master controls the right.
[00:46:35.867 --> 00:46:41.952]  They control the Republican Party, and they control the Democratic Party.
[00:46:41.952 --> 00:46:45.754]  This is not a party issue.
[00:46:45.754 --> 00:46:49.137]  This is not a left-right issue.
[00:46:49.137 --> 00:46:53.941]  The question is, who should government serve?
[00:46:53.941 --> 00:46:55.322]  And it should serve the people.
[00:46:56.030 --> 00:47:03.633]  In fact, government is just a tool of the dominant minority that uses economics and government law to enforce upon the public various mandates.
[00:47:03.633 --> 00:47:06.834]  The right-left paradigm in the U.S.
[00:47:06.834 --> 00:47:07.235]  and U.S.
[00:47:07.235 --> 00:47:12.597]  politics is taken directly from the commercial world and the corporate world.
[00:47:12.597 --> 00:47:14.778]  In the business world, you have Coke, Pepsi.
[00:47:14.778 --> 00:47:16.478]  You have McDonald's, Burger King.
[00:47:16.478 --> 00:47:18.879]  You've got AT&T and Verizon.
[00:47:18.879 --> 00:47:20.060]  You've got duopolies.
[00:47:21.175 --> 00:47:26.917]  And a duopoly gives the illusion of there being some competition and some choice.
[00:47:26.917 --> 00:47:29.258]  And it looks a little bit better than a monopoly.
[00:47:29.258 --> 00:47:42.302]  So, for example, in communist Russia, if they had communist Russia red and communist Russia chartreuse, there would have been the illusion of choice and something akin to democracy in Russia.
[00:47:42.302 --> 00:47:44.743]  But they simply said, forget it, we're just going to go with red.
[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:56.625]  In the U.S., they have this left-right paradigm, which, unfortunately, it doesn't take them out of the hard-cold fact that there is no choice.
[00:47:56.625 --> 00:47:57.846]  There's no social justice.
[00:47:57.846 --> 00:48:05.689]  There's only one choice, which is to supply more rent to the rent-seekers who have now taken the whole system hostage.
[00:48:05.689 --> 00:48:09.011]  We've seen the limitations on government whittled away.
[00:48:10.083 --> 00:48:15.105]  We have seen this erosion to the point where today seems like nobody does care.
[00:48:15.105 --> 00:48:20.627]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[00:48:20.627 --> 00:48:25.709]  If the United States doesn't have its Bill of Rights and Constitution, it doesn't exist anymore.
[00:48:25.709 --> 00:48:27.990]  It's just more real estate, more dirt.
[00:48:27.990 --> 00:48:30.671]  And that's what these global corporatists want.
[00:48:30.671 --> 00:48:36.053]  They want to completely dismantle the Bill of Rights and Constitution, and they're doing that right now.
[00:48:36.053 --> 00:48:38.074]  This is the fall of the Republic.
[00:48:38.074 --> 00:48:39.415]  Our nation is dying.
[00:48:40.219 --> 00:48:47.466]  We the people that live in this fine country need to stand up, get involved, and take the system back.
[00:48:47.466 --> 00:48:56.774]  It's the Bill of Rights and Constitution that we owe allegiance to, not to a political party, and not to politicians that wrap themselves in the red, white, and blue.
[00:48:57.495 --> 00:49:02.837]  Well, at the same time, they destroy everything that that sacred flag stands for.
[00:49:02.837 --> 00:49:07.539]  So in the old days, you used to have this globe with 180 some odd countries.
[00:49:07.539 --> 00:49:15.402]  And a few of those countries had a lot of power, like the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and the United States at various times.
[00:49:15.402 --> 00:49:17.543]  But today, you might better look at that globe
[00:49:18.603 --> 00:49:23.547]  And say that it's surrounded by huge clouds swirling around the planet.
[00:49:23.547 --> 00:49:25.508]  They know no national boundaries.
[00:49:25.508 --> 00:49:28.630]  They don't follow any specific sets of laws.
[00:49:28.630 --> 00:49:30.672]  And these are the big corporations.
[00:49:30.672 --> 00:49:34.274]  They basically control politicians around the world because they have all the money.
[00:49:34.274 --> 00:49:41.480]  And politicians always need money to get elected or to run their governments if they're not democratically elected politicians.
[00:49:41.480 --> 00:49:45.543]  They control the mainstream press either through outright ownership or advertising budgets.
[00:49:46.491 --> 00:49:53.736]  They have massive amounts of lobbyists in Washington that have tremendous influence on our President and Congress.
[00:49:53.736 --> 00:49:56.158]  And they really are calling the shots.
[00:49:56.158 --> 00:50:11.748]  They form partnerships with the Chinese and the Taiwanese and the Tibetans, or with the Israelis and Arab nations, with Brazilians and Indians, with whatever country and whatever group of people has resources that they covet.
[00:50:11.748 --> 00:50:15.610]  And they, so for the first time in history, we really have this new form of
[00:50:16.931 --> 00:50:17.992]  Of an empire.
[00:50:17.992 --> 00:50:30.276]  Barack Obama is a puppet of the New World Order to bring in a World Bank, to destroy the economy of this country, and to bring in global governance.
[00:50:30.276 --> 00:50:36.679]  And no matter how lifeable the fellow is, we as citizens of this country need to stand up and say no.
[00:50:37.469 --> 00:50:48.516]  Alright folks, we're going to be back on the other side and break down a key strategic attack system that the globalists have launched, not just here but worldwide, the takeover of our energy systems.
[00:50:48.516 --> 00:50:52.758]  The White House responded to PrisonBlinded.com last Friday, and we know why.
[00:50:52.758 --> 00:50:54.659]  They've been caught with their pants down.
[00:50:54.659 --> 00:50:56.941]  And if we expose what they're doing, they will fail.
[00:51:01.468 --> 00:51:06.152]  We all know that Berkey Water Purification Systems are the most trusted name in water filtration.
[00:51:06.152 --> 00:51:15.019]  As an authorized Berkey dealer for over five years and serving thousands of satisfied customers, the Berkey Guy offers amazing specials for Berkey Water Filtration Systems.

[00:52:01.994 --> 00:52:06.017]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[00:52:06.017 --> 00:52:09.278]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[00:52:09.278 --> 00:52:14.081]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[00:52:14.081 --> 00:52:20.445]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[00:52:20.445 --> 00:52:22.686]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[00:52:23.226 --> 00:52:23.526]  Tim Geithner?
[00:52:23.526 --> 00:52:23.786]  Bernanke?
[00:52:23.786 --> 00:52:24.366]  They're arsonists!
[00:52:24.366 --> 00:52:25.167]  They're asking for more matches!
[00:52:25.167 --> 00:52:26.847]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[00:52:42.133 --> 00:52:43.975]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[00:52:43.975 --> 00:52:49.420]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the republic.
[00:52:49.420 --> 00:52:58.528]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[00:53:00.370 --> 00:53:01.651]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[00:53:01.651 --> 00:53:07.254]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[00:53:07.254 --> 00:53:12.276]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[00:53:12.276 --> 00:53:17.299]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[00:53:17.839 --> 00:53:23.063]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[00:53:23.063 --> 00:53:25.384]  They call it a Survival Seed Bank.
[00:53:25.384 --> 00:53:30.187]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[00:53:30.187 --> 00:53:31.308]  And here's the best part.
[00:53:31.308 --> 00:53:34.370]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[00:53:34.370 --> 00:53:37.993]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[00:53:37.993 --> 00:53:41.175]  So visit them today at SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:53:41.175 --> 00:53:43.396]  That's SurvivalSeedBank.com.
[00:53:43.396 --> 00:53:44.317]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[00:53:47.959 --> 00:53:50.920]  That's 877-327-0365.
[00:53:50.920 --> 00:53:57.023]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[00:53:57.023 --> 00:54:02.225]  This is Alex Jones for SurvivalSeaBank.com.
[00:54:02.225 --> 00:54:08.047]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex Jones Show.
[00:54:08.047 --> 00:54:10.348]  Because there's a war on for your mind.
[00:54:12.621 --> 00:54:17.685]  Al Jazeera is reporting that Hosni Mubarak may step down in the next few days.
[00:54:17.685 --> 00:54:20.987]  He's not going to try to hold on until September.
[00:54:20.987 --> 00:54:31.614]  And during the break, Fox News was reporting that insiders inside the Mubarak government have told Fox News that he is about to step down and that it is imminent.
[00:54:33.325 --> 00:54:46.968]  And then now you'll basically have the same dictatorial parliament that he already had in place, will still be there, still financed by the United States and Israel and others, and I guess they're going to move in ElBaradei, that some say is good, others say is bad.
[00:54:46.968 --> 00:54:56.591]  We know the vice president of Mubarak's the big torture master, that's his supposed replacement for other people, so a big development on that front.
[00:54:57.645 --> 00:55:00.806]  Now, this story affects your power prices.
[00:55:00.806 --> 00:55:05.747]  It affects American companies being able to get inexpensive, affordable energy.
[00:55:05.747 --> 00:55:07.967]  China, again, builds three to five new power plants a week.
[00:55:07.967 --> 00:55:10.288]  We get to build three a year.
[00:55:10.288 --> 00:55:13.448]  They've been blocking power plants and shutting them down all over the country.
[00:55:13.448 --> 00:55:15.429]  And here is CBS News today.
[00:55:15.429 --> 00:55:22.930]  North Texas could see more rolling blackouts as demand for electricity could reach record high levels this morning.
[00:55:22.930 --> 00:55:24.851]  And now they are reporting there have been some blackouts.
[00:55:26.601 --> 00:55:31.383]  Dovetail that with Newsmax reporting massive closures, that's a quote, of U.S.
[00:55:31.383 --> 00:55:34.304]  coal plants loom, Chu says.
[00:55:34.304 --> 00:55:34.784]  The U.S.
[00:55:34.784 --> 00:55:36.325]  has an aging inventory.
[00:55:36.325 --> 00:55:38.886]  Oh, that's aging, so they need to shut them down.
[00:55:38.886 --> 00:55:40.066]  It's government orders.
[00:55:40.066 --> 00:55:46.369]  Of coal-fired plants, and many units might be closed before the end of the decade, Energy Secretary Stephen Chu said.
[00:55:46.949 --> 00:55:50.171]  We're going to see massive retirements within the next five, eight years.
[00:55:50.171 --> 00:55:52.272]  Yeah, under government regulations.
[00:55:52.272 --> 00:55:58.335]  Chu said today, as the Renewable Energy Conference in Washington, much of our fleet of coal plants is 40 to 50 years old.
[00:55:58.335 --> 00:55:59.016]  The sites are.
[00:55:59.016 --> 00:56:00.337]  They've been updating them.
[00:56:00.337 --> 00:56:03.138]  President Barack Obama said last month the U.S.
[00:56:03.138 --> 00:56:09.642]  should eliminate tax subsidies for fossil fuel production worth $4 billion a year so it can boost spending on renewable energy.
[00:56:09.642 --> 00:56:11.203]  Ah, yes, that costs 10 times more on average.
[00:56:12.043 --> 00:56:19.406]  And they go on to say that they're going to shut down hundreds of coal-powered plants in the next five to eight years.
[00:56:19.406 --> 00:56:28.070]  And they've already been blocking new ones being built, blocking already finished, high-tech ones, that nothing comes out but carbon dioxide and water vapor, and they're calling that the new pollution.
[00:56:28.070 --> 00:56:41.036]  And our articles countering the White House lies on Sunday, the articles where we counter their lies from Friday, where they responded and said, oh, there's these liars, you know, saying that we're causing the blackouts.
[00:56:42.233 --> 00:56:43.893]  But it's cold weather.
[00:56:43.893 --> 00:56:47.754]  There were 50 plus malfunctions in Texas alone.
[00:56:47.754 --> 00:56:57.177]  Well, I happen to have the report here, and Paul Watson has links to the government reports.
[00:56:57.177 --> 00:57:01.718]  White House lies on blackouts exposed.
[00:57:01.718 --> 00:57:03.558]  I mean, it should be White House confirmed.
[00:57:03.558 --> 00:57:06.659]  White House, great article, but it should be White House confirms.
[00:57:08.839 --> 00:57:12.583]  Or confirmed, White House energy policies cause blackouts.
[00:57:12.583 --> 00:57:15.265]  Confirmed, White House energy policies cause blackouts.
[00:57:15.265 --> 00:57:16.866]  And Paul Joseph Watson goes over this.
[00:57:16.866 --> 00:57:20.129]  White House lies on blackouts exposed.
[00:57:20.129 --> 00:57:33.320]  And it goes on from there, breaking it all down, that Obama Communications Director Peter Pfeiffer attacked our article blaming the White House anti-energy policy for contributing to the severity of the rolling blackouts that have occurred over the past few weeks.
[00:57:33.320 --> 00:57:33.861]  He claimed that the
[00:57:35.422 --> 00:57:42.488]  Outages had nothing to do with maxed out grids and were in fact solely the result of mechanical failures.
[00:57:42.488 --> 00:58:01.863]  Well, this formed the foundation of Pfeiffer's charge that our research was unquestionably false, quote, and was used to dismiss our argument that the Obama administration's strict enforcement of draconian EPA regulations that has led to the new clean burning coal plants being mothballed and other existing ones being shut down.
[00:58:02.964 --> 00:58:08.485]  Has in turn led to Texas and other states becoming energy dependent, leading to shortages and blackouts.
[00:58:08.485 --> 00:58:16.507]  Whether or not the White House lied comes down to whether the severity of the blackouts was made worse by maxed out power grids or mechanical failures.
[00:58:16.507 --> 00:58:24.969]  The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the agency that oversees the state's power, says the energy grid was nearly maxed out.
[00:58:24.969 --> 00:58:29.870]  WFAA TV reports the agency has warned consumers that they could
[00:58:30.350 --> 00:58:34.715]  Should conserve power, and if they don't, rolling blackouts will likely happen once again.
[00:58:34.715 --> 00:58:39.061]  And they go on to say it was not mechanical failures.
[00:58:39.061 --> 00:58:44.667]  They were maxed out.
[00:58:44.667 --> 00:58:48.392]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:50.745 --> 00:58:54.966]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[00:58:54.966 --> 00:59:01.367]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[00:59:01.367 --> 00:59:08.748]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[00:59:08.748 --> 00:59:13.629]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[00:59:22.331 --> 00:59:24.632]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[00:59:53.701 --> 00:59:56.082]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.082 --> 00:59:58.863]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.441 --> 01:00:10.265]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.265 --> 01:00:11.867]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.867 --> 01:00:13.408]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.408 --> 01:00:17.612]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.612 --> 01:00:23.757]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:23.757 --> 01:00:32.225]  Okay, I want to open the phones up in the next two segments ahead of Max Keiser joining us, then Stuart Rhodes, founder of Mouthkeepers, joining us in studio in the third hour.
[01:00:33.874 --> 01:00:36.355]  But I really want to hear from callers specifically.
[01:00:36.355 --> 01:00:43.156]  You can talk about whatever you want, but I'd like to hear your take on it being confirmed that there weren't mechanical malfunctions at 50 power plants.
[01:00:43.156 --> 01:00:47.718]  Notice how they just said 50, just made up a round number.
[01:00:47.718 --> 01:00:53.879]  That it was the lack of building new plants and the record amount of power being used that caused it.
[01:00:53.879 --> 01:00:55.539]  And now new ones are happening today.
[01:00:55.539 --> 01:00:59.500]  And the Energy Secretary says get ready for massive closures under their new rules.
[01:00:59.500 --> 01:01:01.081]  They've already been shutting down as many as they can.
[01:01:02.068 --> 01:01:05.089]  And so there, egg on the face of the White House.
[01:01:05.089 --> 01:01:07.850]  And Drudge is reporting the blackouts again.
[01:01:07.850 --> 01:01:10.291]  I've been attacked by the White House.
[01:01:10.291 --> 01:01:17.273]  I think it's important for everybody to get this article that Watson did, White House lies on blackouts exposed.
[01:01:17.273 --> 01:01:23.636]  That's a great article by Watson, but I think the headline, I'm going to try to get a hold of Watson, should be changed, at least on InfoWars since Kurt's here.
[01:01:23.636 --> 01:01:25.156]  I'm going to get a hold of him.
[01:01:25.156 --> 01:01:26.457]  He's in office.
[01:01:26.457 --> 01:01:27.657]  Watson's over in England.
[01:01:31.687 --> 01:01:33.535]  I mean, the headlines should be confirmed.
[01:01:33.535 --> 01:01:35.584]  White House policies contributed to blackouts.
[01:01:36.544 --> 01:01:38.125]  I mean, it's a fact.
[01:01:38.125 --> 01:01:45.711]  You got the head of the Energy Department running around saying they're going to shut down massive amounts of these.
[01:01:45.711 --> 01:01:48.252]  I mean, it's incredible what's happening.
[01:01:48.252 --> 01:01:51.014]  In plain view, they're attacking our energy infrastructure.
[01:01:51.014 --> 01:01:52.656]  I'd like to get your take on that.
[01:01:52.656 --> 01:01:55.237]  Or the see something, say something exposed as a hoax.
[01:01:55.237 --> 01:02:02.102]  We can't get a terror threat and evidence of who we know is working
[01:02:03.697 --> 01:02:32.998]  for the Pentagon and we're all lucky they won't take our complaints but you can't even get on the phone you can't even get people on the phone before they've heard what we say many times showing that this threat so eminent why are they answering the phone threat so eminent why did they turn off the naked body scanners during the uh... four five day period and around thanksgiving knowing we were gonna be protesting they wanted that story go away and to kill it they failed but uh... that's happening and now on the heels of the patriot act not being reauthorized
[01:02:34.335 --> 01:02:38.677]  Homeland Security runs in before Congress and says, Amir al-Awlaki is now the leader of Al-Qaeda.
[01:02:38.677 --> 01:02:39.537]  He's about to hit us.
[01:02:39.537 --> 01:02:42.798]  And we're like, well here's Fox News and AP saying he works for the U.S.
[01:02:42.798 --> 01:02:44.059]  government.
[01:02:44.059 --> 01:02:47.560]  This has confirmed Pentagon documents that patriots leaked.
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:50.041]  And we got good people in our government at many levels.
[01:02:50.041 --> 01:02:50.961]  Let's talk about this.
[01:02:50.961 --> 01:02:53.042]  The media's like, oh, we don't want to talk about that.
[01:02:54.454 --> 01:02:57.716]  So I hope that you'll want to discuss that information.
[01:02:57.716 --> 01:03:00.377]  You can call in about whatever you want.
[01:03:00.377 --> 01:03:05.880]  I'd love to hear from you.
[01:03:05.880 --> 01:03:06.621]  800-259-9231.
[01:03:06.621 --> 01:03:09.943]  800-259-9231.
[01:03:09.943 --> 01:03:11.944]  These really are times that try men's souls.
[01:03:11.944 --> 01:03:14.225]  I mean, this is all out in the open.
[01:03:14.225 --> 01:03:16.306]  This is the elephant in the room.
[01:03:16.306 --> 01:03:18.007]  And that's what's so frustrating for me.
[01:03:18.007 --> 01:03:18.908]  Not even frustrating.
[01:03:22.901 --> 01:03:26.764]  It's disgusting for me to sit here and know their battle plan.
[01:03:26.764 --> 01:03:27.965]  It's all stated.
[01:03:27.965 --> 01:03:38.935]  The White House puts out all these memos and their advisors put out memos saying how great it would be if there was a big terror attack because that would make Obama look like a strong leader and then he could take more of our rights away.
[01:03:38.935 --> 01:03:41.937]  And they just do it in the open like we're blind, like we're zombies.
[01:03:41.937 --> 01:03:44.299]  And I guess a lot of the public are zombies.
[01:03:44.299 --> 01:03:47.262]  They don't see themselves in the role of standing up against corruption.
[01:03:47.822 --> 01:03:54.644]  They don't see themselves in the role in fighting tyranny and people trying to jack up their power prices and rip them off like we're a third world nation.
[01:03:54.644 --> 01:03:56.705]  This is what's happened to all the third world countries.
[01:03:56.705 --> 01:03:59.406]  They get corrupt governments in that run these same scams.
[01:03:59.406 --> 01:04:03.068]  And the multinationals come in and teach them how to do it and finance the whole thing.
[01:04:03.068 --> 01:04:04.748]  And it's happening in Western Europe.
[01:04:04.748 --> 01:04:05.788]  It's happening in the U.S.
[01:04:05.788 --> 01:04:06.569]  and Canada.
[01:04:06.569 --> 01:04:08.169]  It's happening in Eastern Europe now.
[01:04:08.169 --> 01:04:09.930]  They're doing it in the Middle East now.
[01:04:09.930 --> 01:04:12.931]  This is a predatory system of control and domination.
[01:04:12.931 --> 01:04:13.991]  They want us poor.
[01:04:13.991 --> 01:04:15.112]  They want us dependent on them.
[01:04:16.502 --> 01:04:17.663]  And I'm tired of it.
[01:04:17.663 --> 01:04:18.684]  I want it to stop.
[01:04:18.684 --> 01:04:20.005]  I have three children.
[01:04:20.005 --> 01:04:21.666]  I have a wife I love.
[01:04:21.666 --> 01:04:23.208]  I know you've got family you love.
[01:04:23.208 --> 01:04:24.549]  This is wrong!
[01:04:24.549 --> 01:04:27.411]  I mean, if they get away with all of this, what's next?
[01:04:27.411 --> 01:04:29.193]  We're going off the deep end.
[01:04:29.193 --> 01:04:31.254]  We're going off the cliff here.
[01:04:31.254 --> 01:04:34.157]  And yeah, a lot of folks are waking up.
[01:04:34.157 --> 01:04:43.525]  But we've got to really consciously realize the super hardcore, off-the-chart severity of exactly what we're dealing with here.
[01:04:45.247 --> 01:04:47.208]  All right, we'll come back and go to your phone calls.
[01:04:47.208 --> 01:04:51.591]  I'll lean on the ropes, lean on the callers, because I'm just getting an incredible headache even dealing with this.
[01:04:51.591 --> 01:04:54.233]  And then Max Keiser's coming up.
[01:04:54.233 --> 01:04:56.855]  It's just, it's unbelievable.
[01:04:56.855 --> 01:04:59.157]  Infowars.com, prisonplotter.tv are the websites.
[01:05:01.598 --> 01:05:17.073]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions anywhere in or on the body.
[01:05:17.073 --> 01:05:20.757]  My name is Mario Cifaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:05:21.755 --> 01:05:34.529]  Not only does the Silver Lung System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions, it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions directly to key target areas.
[01:05:34.529 --> 01:05:41.797]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin, and orally for the digestive system.
[01:05:42.478 --> 01:05:52.847]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.SilverLungs.com to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.

[01:06:00.489 --> 01:06:05.052]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:06:05.052 --> 01:06:05.952]  Number 1.
[01:06:05.952 --> 01:06:09.374]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:06:09.374 --> 01:06:10.234]  Number 2.
[01:06:10.234 --> 01:06:15.137]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:06:15.137 --> 01:06:15.878]  It's true.
[01:06:15.878 --> 01:06:20.760]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:21.581]  Number 3.
[01:06:21.581 --> 01:06:25.163]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:06:25.163 --> 01:06:28.865]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:06:29.065 --> 01:06:29.866]  Number four.
[01:06:29.866 --> 01:06:32.628]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:06:32.628 --> 01:06:36.311]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:06:36.311 --> 01:06:37.091]  Number five.
[01:06:37.091 --> 01:06:41.234]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:06:41.234 --> 01:06:46.298]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:06:46.298 --> 01:06:50.482]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:50.482 --> 01:06:52.263]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:06:52.263 --> 01:06:54.505]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.
[01:06:54.505 --> 01:06:56.846]  So go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327.
[01:07:00.248 --> 01:07:04.069]  Diamond Gusset is proud to announce the anthem of the Patriot movement.
[01:07:04.069 --> 01:07:08.370]  They're offering a free CD, t-shirt, and bumper sticker with a qualifying purchase.
[01:07:08.370 --> 01:07:13.171]  Diamond Gusset offers great products at great prices while keeping Americans working.
[01:07:13.171 --> 01:07:19.012]  Not looking for a factory where a man can feed his family.
[01:07:19.012 --> 01:07:22.652]  Not worried about them moving south.
[01:07:22.652 --> 01:07:26.133]  Closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:07:28.798 --> 01:07:34.322]  I'm looking for America.
[01:07:34.322 --> 01:07:35.943]  Wear American and be proud.
[01:07:35.943 --> 01:07:38.565]  Go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:07:38.565 --> 01:07:43.068]  The land I left free and the home of the brave.
[01:07:43.068 --> 01:07:46.951]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:07:54.750 --> 01:08:01.878]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America Today.
[01:08:01.878 --> 01:08:04.661]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[01:08:04.661 --> 01:08:07.465]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:26.570]  Okay, if you just joined us, we're now into hour number two on this 10th day of February, this Thursday, 2011.
[01:08:29.619 --> 01:08:30.239]  We're good to go.
[01:08:59.141 --> 01:09:03.262]  We've got the headline, see something, say something exposed as a hoax.
[01:09:03.262 --> 01:09:13.504]  Many of the phone numbers on official Homeland Security websites and flyers just don't even go to a voicemail that says you cannot, a robot voice says you cannot leave a message at this number.
[01:09:13.504 --> 01:09:14.964]  Beep!
[01:09:14.964 --> 01:09:18.765]  And it's a number I've called before and gotten them.
[01:09:18.765 --> 01:09:20.325]  You call Homeland Security in D.C.
[01:09:20.325 --> 01:09:22.646]  and say I want to report evidence of who the real terrorists are.
[01:09:23.510 --> 01:09:24.172]  They won't let you.
[01:09:24.172 --> 01:09:25.816]  They say call your local police.
[01:09:25.816 --> 01:09:26.959]  They just sent you the voicemail.
[01:09:26.959 --> 01:09:27.640]  We gave them our numbers.
[01:09:27.640 --> 01:09:28.663]  They haven't called us back.
[01:09:28.663 --> 01:09:31.610]  I've been calling them since Sunday, live and off air.
[01:09:32.793 --> 01:09:33.693]  Let's test this number.
[01:09:33.693 --> 01:09:34.314]  Oh, it doesn't work.
[01:09:34.314 --> 01:09:35.014]  Let's test that number.
[01:09:35.014 --> 01:09:37.935]  These are new numbers, recently put out.
[01:09:37.935 --> 01:09:47.439]  I mean, you can't get them but a paper box flies out of a car, they call it in themselves, shut down the highway, send out a million dollar robot.
[01:09:47.439 --> 01:09:57.384]  Austin just spent over a million bucks on some robots and the defense complex gets the money, and they just run around constantly blowing up cardboard boxes and say, we don't know if it was a bomb, but we blew it up.
[01:09:57.864 --> 01:10:01.825]  Then you can pull up the after action reports when they're releasing it, nothing in it.
[01:10:01.825 --> 01:10:03.606]  They just, oh, that might have been a bomb.
[01:10:03.606 --> 01:10:08.407]  Oh, oh, oh, terrorists may have just hit Belton, you know, instead of back in 2000.
[01:10:08.407 --> 01:10:11.889]  And we go up there and it's a drill and then they tell everybody terrorists hit.
[01:10:11.889 --> 01:10:16.070]  I mean, it's just psychological warfare against the people.
[01:10:17.296 --> 01:10:24.203]  And now the Texas Electricity Reliability Commission has said, no, we didn't have any malfunctions in our power plants.
[01:10:24.203 --> 01:10:27.025]  We've not been allowed to build new power plants.
[01:10:27.025 --> 01:10:31.129]  And so we're being taxed by the cold weather.
[01:10:31.129 --> 01:10:38.456]  And the White House Energy Secretary comes out in a press conference yesterday and says, we're going to shut down massive amounts.
[01:10:38.456 --> 01:10:40.037]  Let me give you the actual headline.
[01:10:40.037 --> 01:10:42.579]  White House lies on blackouts exposed.
[01:10:43.759 --> 01:10:44.580]  Here's Newsmax.
[01:10:44.580 --> 01:10:45.740]  Massive closures of U.S.
[01:10:45.740 --> 01:10:48.522]  coal plants looms, Chu says.
[01:10:48.522 --> 01:10:50.663]  And they've got his quotes in a press conference.
[01:10:50.663 --> 01:10:52.904]  Now they're going to close massive numbers down.
[01:10:52.904 --> 01:10:54.124]  But the White House says, no, we're not.
[01:10:54.124 --> 01:10:56.365]  We're not shutting anything down.
[01:10:56.365 --> 01:10:59.407]  Alex is a liar.
[01:10:59.407 --> 01:11:01.308]  Meanwhile, yeah, we're shutting them down.
[01:11:01.308 --> 01:11:05.430]  It's like when I had David Rothschild and others on pushing carbon taxes.
[01:11:05.430 --> 01:11:07.591]  They'd be all over TV pushing global carbon taxes.
[01:11:07.591 --> 01:11:09.712]  I got on and say, you want carbon taxes?
[01:11:09.712 --> 01:11:11.353]  No, this has nothing to do with carbon taxes.
[01:11:13.453 --> 01:11:20.295]  I mean, they just talk to us like we're morons!
[01:11:20.295 --> 01:11:21.355]  It's incredible.
[01:11:21.355 --> 01:11:22.816]  It's just incredible.
[01:11:22.816 --> 01:11:23.856]  Let's go to your phone calls.
[01:11:23.856 --> 01:11:26.997]  Rick in Tennessee, thanks for holding.
[01:11:26.997 --> 01:11:28.117]  Hey Alex, how you doing?
[01:11:28.117 --> 01:11:29.277]  I'm doing alright, man.
[01:11:29.277 --> 01:11:37.720]  I just want to let you know that I took your advice and I started a coalition against the water fluoridation here in Murfreesboro, Tennessee.
[01:11:37.720 --> 01:11:38.620]  It's Rutherford County.
[01:11:39.335 --> 01:11:40.616]  Well, let me throw this at you, Rick.
[01:12:08.260 --> 01:12:29.138]  As you form that cadre against water fluoridation, and as Calgary and San Diego and all these other cities either take it out or move to block it being put in, as we give support to the vast majority of government scientists who've signed on to national papers saying it's sevenfold, I always said a doubling.
[01:12:29.138 --> 01:12:31.580]  That was one study I was covering from years ago.
[01:12:31.580 --> 01:12:36.144]  The new studies, they saw a sevenfold increase in men, tripling in women.
[01:12:36.764 --> 01:12:37.985]  I mean, I'm getting chills right now.
[01:12:37.985 --> 01:12:40.025]  It attacks your fertility.
[01:12:40.025 --> 01:12:42.906]  In men and women, it attacks the thyroid.
[01:12:42.906 --> 01:12:44.727]  All these brain disorders are up.
[01:12:44.727 --> 01:12:45.928]  That's in the news.
[01:12:45.928 --> 01:12:47.588]  Strokes are up in young people.
[01:12:47.588 --> 01:12:51.670]  People are dropping dead all over from the aspartame and the fluoride.
[01:12:51.670 --> 01:12:54.391]  But here's the key, Rick.
[01:12:54.391 --> 01:12:57.892]  You form that coalition, you start having victories.
[01:12:57.892 --> 01:13:02.014]  Once you have that coalition and you start having victories like Washington and Trenton politically,
[01:13:02.847 --> 01:13:11.791]  Then you can take that same cadre of true activists that love liberty, and you can start dealing with all the other corruption in your area.
[01:13:11.791 --> 01:13:19.315]  You can start dealing with the federalization of your police, the threat fusion centers, the illegal checkpoints that your governor's been fighting in Tennessee.
[01:13:19.315 --> 01:13:30.640]  You can start moving down the line once you pick an issue, whether it's fighting the corruption of the TSA, or fighting the move against the Second Amendment, and then spinoffs of those
[01:13:31.460 --> 01:13:33.982]  It's so incredible, so I salute you.
[01:13:33.982 --> 01:13:34.663]  That's the whole thing.
[01:13:34.663 --> 01:13:39.567]  I'm using, like, the Dave Ramsey philosophy, and that's like, start with the smallest one person, go for it.
[01:13:39.567 --> 01:13:42.170]  And actually, I've been making some communications.
[01:13:42.170 --> 01:13:47.294]  I'm finding out that water fluoridation is not a mandate, it's a voluntary situation.
[01:13:47.294 --> 01:13:51.278]  And I even talked with the water company about that, and he said, no, it's voluntary.
[01:13:51.278 --> 01:13:54.381]  So I said, okay, we're going to be at the board meeting as soon as I get enough people.
[01:13:55.429 --> 01:13:58.633]  Uh, you know, to represent, to go in as a group.
[01:13:58.633 --> 01:14:04.920]  I mean, not as a whole group, not taking everybody and having enough people that, you know, you got enough force behind you saying, hey, we don't want this anymore.
[01:14:04.920 --> 01:14:07.163]  Rick, let me tell you how they're going to counter you.
[01:14:07.163 --> 01:14:13.971]  I don't know what your county's getting, but it's probably in the hundreds of thousands of years, in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[01:14:13.971 --> 01:14:15.292]  So when you go in, they're going to say,
[01:14:16.073 --> 01:14:22.295]  Rick, and guys, we're getting hundreds of thousands, in some big cities millions, from the federal government.
[01:14:22.295 --> 01:14:29.136]  Yes, this is voluntary, but if we want our Clean Water Act funding, isn't that Orwellian oxymoron?
[01:14:29.136 --> 01:14:33.497]  The Clean Water Act, and they use funding through it to try to force cities to put water in.
[01:14:33.497 --> 01:14:37.298]  They're going to say, Rick, taxpayers, we need this federal money.
[01:14:37.298 --> 01:14:41.199]  Well, it's your tax money that was taken to begin with, and then used to control you.
[01:14:41.199 --> 01:14:43.640]  But then, they're not going to tell you, by the way,
[01:14:44.460 --> 01:14:45.721]  And I've looked at this in other cities.
[01:14:45.721 --> 01:14:52.924]  Generally, buying the fluoride generally costs more than even what the federal stipend is.
[01:14:52.924 --> 01:14:54.165]  So you can counter them with that.
[01:14:54.165 --> 01:14:58.927]  Well, you're not going to have to pay for the fluoride anymore, the overpriced poison.
[01:14:58.927 --> 01:15:05.430]  And so that generally, in cities we've looked at, will be more than the federal funding for your water district.
[01:15:06.890 --> 01:15:17.052]  They also come in with clean water acts and make you put in more systems that actually toxify the water so it's too expensive for your local city to run it to incentivize you to sell it out to foreigners.
[01:15:17.052 --> 01:15:21.773]  So this is all part of a strategic program and obviously water is central.
[01:15:21.773 --> 01:15:22.333]  God bless you.
[01:15:22.333 --> 01:15:25.073]  But I wanted to give you some points of how they're going to counter you.
[01:15:25.073 --> 01:15:30.554]  And then when you just say, well, I've got the city or county press release here on how much this fluoride cost.
[01:15:30.554 --> 01:15:34.155]  The city of Austin pays close to a million dollars a year.
[01:15:34.935 --> 01:15:35.335]  Hello?
[01:15:35.335 --> 01:15:36.435]  Hey Alex, how are you doing?
[01:15:36.435 --> 01:15:37.716]  A quick point and a question for you.
[01:15:37.716 --> 01:15:39.136]  To the people that are not awake,
[01:16:04.963 --> 01:16:14.249]  If they're cutting off the power with unprecedented cold sweeping through, that means they don't care if you freeze in your homes and die.
[01:16:14.249 --> 01:16:17.571]  Well, how many people have died because they couldn't pay for their power?
[01:16:17.571 --> 01:16:26.776]  I see it in the news every week, last year and this year, and it's almost always some old vet who, you know, trying to heat themselves at their stove and is found frozen to death.
[01:16:26.776 --> 01:16:33.420]  I mean, how many times do we hear about folks in Minnesota and Michigan and New York and Illinois and places freezing to death?
[01:16:34.406 --> 01:16:34.886]  Right, Alex.
[01:16:34.886 --> 01:16:46.410]  And my point was that, you know, if you really believe that these are the same people that are going to protect you from terrorists, who will not protect you from the cold, you're sadly mistaken.
[01:16:46.410 --> 01:16:47.871]  Well, then they'll claim they're free market.
[01:16:47.871 --> 01:16:50.472]  They'll say, well, it's your job to pay for overpriced power.
[01:16:50.472 --> 01:16:53.293]  But they're artificially jacking up the price.
[01:16:53.293 --> 01:16:56.274]  Coal is dirt cheap, literally dirt cheap.
[01:16:56.274 --> 01:16:59.095]  And these systems are clean.
[01:16:59.095 --> 01:17:00.455]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:17:00.455 --> 01:17:01.576]  Alex, real quick, my question.
[01:17:02.751 --> 01:17:11.268]  I read an article, probably a couple, a few months ago about the thermal belt in the Gulf and it being shut down due to the BP oil spill.
[01:17:11.268 --> 01:17:14.274]  I was wondering if you had a chance to look at that and what was your take on it?
[01:17:14.764 --> 01:17:16.164]  It's inconclusive.
[01:17:16.164 --> 01:17:20.526]  It's true that the jet stream, one of the main jet streams, has slowed or almost stalled.
[01:17:20.526 --> 01:17:25.167]  People said it was the end of the world, but it turns out that does happen infrequently.
[01:17:25.167 --> 01:17:32.789]  And that's part of the reason now it's not pushing through and keeping those cold weather systems from dropping down.
[01:17:32.789 --> 01:17:34.150]  And there was some evidence that
[01:17:36.021 --> 01:17:45.731]  That areas of the Gulf, the water stream, not the jet stream, did slow down for a while, but that happens as well.
[01:17:45.731 --> 01:17:47.253]  I did look into that.
[01:17:47.253 --> 01:17:57.344]  I don't know if the millions and millions of gallons of core exit and the reportedly billion plus gallons of oil had an effect on that.
[01:17:57.344 --> 01:17:57.985]  I just don't know.
[01:17:59.275 --> 01:18:01.697]  Okay, well thank you for your time, Alex, and you have a good day, buddy.
[01:18:01.697 --> 01:18:02.717]  Thank you so much.
[01:18:02.717 --> 01:18:04.218]  Great points, Brad.
[01:18:04.218 --> 01:18:07.420]  Skyler in Alaska, you're on the air.
[01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:08.401]  How's it going, Alex?
[01:18:08.401 --> 01:18:09.962]  Good.
[01:18:09.962 --> 01:18:12.423]  A couple quick points for you.
[01:18:12.423 --> 01:18:22.650]  I checked out this website called newworldorder.com, and it's a blank page, and it says August 23rd, and that's it, and it says coming soon.
[01:18:24.076 --> 01:18:30.140]  Yeah, well there's a lot of people that own websites, and that's the message it'll have before it's been launched.
[01:18:30.140 --> 01:18:36.644]  People park web domains, people created fake Illuminati domains, and things think it's really the Illuminati.
[01:18:36.644 --> 01:18:39.665]  You know, the internet is rife with hoaxes, but that doesn't sound like a hoax.
[01:18:39.665 --> 01:18:44.048]  It sounds like, you know, somebody's got a website coming soon.
[01:18:44.048 --> 01:18:48.711]  Indeed, and also you got our VP Nod up here.
[01:18:50.370 --> 01:18:52.494]  And, uh, what was the last thing on?
[01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:53.596]  Super Bowl Sunday.
[01:18:53.596 --> 01:18:54.738]  I don't know if you saw.
[01:18:54.738 --> 01:18:56.581]  I'm sure you were working your tail off.
[01:18:56.581 --> 01:19:01.229]  Anyway, I watched it and I saw a commercial for the Mortorella Zoom.
[01:19:02.534 --> 01:19:03.815]  Perhaps you saw the commercial?
[01:19:20.885 --> 01:19:23.408]  Yeah, I was like, okay, this is kind of strange.
[01:19:43.220 --> 01:19:53.015]  The PC version, or I guess kind of Linux open source, I'm not sure, of all these different tablets that are not Apple-driven.
[01:19:53.015 --> 01:19:53.957]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[01:19:53.957 --> 01:19:54.558]  We're going to come back.

[01:22:00.484 --> 01:22:01.666]  A very wealthy U.S.
[01:22:01.666 --> 01:22:08.636]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:22:08.636 --> 01:22:11.199]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:22:11.199 --> 01:22:16.407]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:22:16.587 --> 01:22:19.549]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:22:19.549 --> 01:22:21.871]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:22:21.871 --> 01:22:28.156]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:22:28.156 --> 01:22:31.558]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:22:31.558 --> 01:22:37.383]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:22:37.383 --> 01:22:39.024]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[01:22:39.024 --> 01:22:40.345]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:22:40.345 --> 01:22:43.027]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:22:43.027 --> 01:22:44.428]  He explains everything you need to know.
[01:22:44.688 --> 01:22:47.250]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:22:47.250 --> 01:22:51.792]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[01:22:51.792 --> 01:22:54.414]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:23:15.033 --> 01:23:17.455]  When I first joined, I was being sued.

[01:24:05.289 --> 01:24:11.972]  Massive global consolidation of stock markets coming up in the next segment with Max Keiser joining us from Paris.
[01:24:11.972 --> 01:24:15.394]  There's also other crazy NBC headline.
[01:24:17.728 --> 01:24:23.010]  Pain leads art professor to remove third eye camera from head.
[01:24:23.010 --> 01:24:27.232]  Artist had camera installed in back of head for a performance project.
[01:24:27.232 --> 01:24:31.014]  They're all just training us for digital implantation.
[01:24:31.014 --> 01:24:34.235]  Just absolutely diabolical.
[01:24:34.235 --> 01:24:36.456]  Let's go ahead and talk to John in Texas.
[01:24:36.456 --> 01:24:37.317]  You're on the air, John.
[01:24:37.317 --> 01:24:38.918]  Hi, Alex.
[01:24:38.918 --> 01:24:39.898]  Hey.
[01:24:39.898 --> 01:24:43.119]  Hey, about this diet soda.
[01:24:43.119 --> 01:24:46.341]  Quite a long time ago, I had a friend of mine who used to live off diet Pepsi.
[01:24:47.153 --> 01:24:51.314]  Every time he used to come into work, he always had a 16-ounce Diet Pepsi.
[01:24:51.314 --> 01:24:53.975]  Well, about 12 or 13 years ago, he died of brain cancer.
[01:24:53.975 --> 01:25:00.056]  But I remember that the doctor, his personal physician, told his wife at the time that it was aspartame that killed him.
[01:25:00.056 --> 01:25:01.157]  Flat out told her.
[01:25:01.157 --> 01:25:02.057]  Oh, they knew it.
[01:25:02.057 --> 01:25:04.197]  They tried to get it approved three times.
[01:25:04.197 --> 01:25:06.698]  And then Rumsfeld went in as the head of the company and got it done in 1980.
[01:25:06.698 --> 01:25:10.299]  And I mean, I've had countless scientists, brain surgeons on.
[01:25:10.959 --> 01:25:14.662]  And here it is, mainstream news, young people having strokes from it.
[01:25:14.662 --> 01:25:18.825]  But, oh, we're conspiracy theorists, we're evil, we're bad, okay, fine, drink more of it.
[01:25:18.825 --> 01:25:21.427]  And now it's in over 10,000 processed foods.
[01:25:21.427 --> 01:25:26.652]  You can't buy chewing gum or bubble gum now at a gas station or a shopping mall or wherever.
[01:25:26.652 --> 01:25:30.635]  You have to order pure sugar gum online.
[01:25:30.635 --> 01:25:32.696]  It's in Big League Chew, it's in everything.
[01:25:32.696 --> 01:25:34.138]  You cannot find it.
[01:25:35.120 --> 01:25:42.925]  I mean, it's just, and I've had family sitting there chewing sugar gum in front of me, and I go, that's got aspartame in it, and they go, no it doesn't, Alex.
[01:25:42.925 --> 01:25:44.766]  Come on, man, I'm not stupid.
[01:25:44.766 --> 01:25:46.087]  I go, read the back.
[01:25:46.087 --> 01:25:47.507]  No, I don't have to read the back.
[01:25:47.507 --> 01:25:52.210]  This is my cousin, great guy, really smart, and I said, I actually grabbed him by the arm, and I said, read the back.
[01:25:52.210 --> 01:25:54.031]  And he went, oh my gosh, you're right.
[01:25:54.031 --> 01:25:55.992]  And I said, yeah, you think I make stuff up?
[01:25:55.992 --> 01:26:00.995]  It's everywhere, they've weaponized everything, they're killing us, and I'm sick of it!
[01:26:00.995 --> 01:26:01.776]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:26:02.814 --> 01:26:07.396]  I'd like to talk about state-sponsored terrorism.
[01:26:07.396 --> 01:26:11.997]  I remember a long time ago that they had a picture in a paper of this Klan group.
[01:26:11.997 --> 01:26:14.398]  They all had Thompson submachine guns.
[01:26:14.398 --> 01:26:19.199]  That's what drew me to the article and I read it and it said at the time that the FBI helped them get the guns.
[01:26:19.199 --> 01:26:25.961]  And then they used the Klan having Thompsons, if you go back to the 30s, to get the first gun laws passed.
[01:26:25.961 --> 01:26:28.162]  I don't know if you remember Edward Wilson.
[01:26:28.857 --> 01:26:34.202]  He got caught here in Houston back in the early 80s shipping C4 to Muammar Gaddafi.
[01:26:34.202 --> 01:26:36.384]  And he said he was doing it for the CIA.
[01:26:36.384 --> 01:26:37.485]  The CIA denied it.
[01:26:37.485 --> 01:26:39.166]  They said that he was a rogue agent.
[01:26:39.166 --> 01:26:40.488]  They gave him a trial.
[01:26:40.488 --> 01:26:41.789]  He was found guilty.
[01:26:41.789 --> 01:26:43.070]  He was sentenced to life in prison.
[01:26:43.070 --> 01:26:46.093]  He was in there about 10 years.
[01:26:46.093 --> 01:26:47.594]  He got a new trial, a new lawyer.
[01:26:47.594 --> 01:26:48.495]  They found the evidence.
[01:26:49.611 --> 01:27:02.262]  But what about two years ago, a high-level CIA, you know, black op commander, they pull him over on the road, he was reportedly trying to get intel to people, that had come out, and the Houston cops just execute him.
[01:27:02.262 --> 01:27:07.667]  Because the CIA's got cops in every department, big department, I mean, they just, I mean, they've got hit teams in the Austin department.
[01:27:07.667 --> 01:27:13.772]  They just got, they just call them up, take them out, they'll pull you over right in front of news cameras, nothing happens.
[01:27:13.772 --> 01:27:15.574]  I mean, that's what it is working for this government.
[01:27:16.186 --> 01:27:17.826]  He got a new trial, Alex.
[01:27:17.826 --> 01:27:18.927]  They found him innocent.
[01:27:18.927 --> 01:27:20.827]  The judge exonerated him.
[01:27:20.827 --> 01:27:26.109]  And they found out he really was working for the CIA, shipping C4 to Muammar Gaddafi.
[01:27:26.109 --> 01:27:30.830]  But at the time, nobody said, hey, what's the CIA doing shipping C4 to Muammar Gaddafi?
[01:27:30.830 --> 01:27:31.611]  They run the...
[01:27:32.791 --> 01:27:34.572]  People think one-dimensionally.
[01:27:34.572 --> 01:27:37.333]  They think, well, Alex says Al-Qaeda is government-run.
[01:27:37.333 --> 01:27:39.613]  That means he loves Muslim extremists.
[01:27:39.613 --> 01:27:40.494]  No!
[01:27:40.494 --> 01:27:41.794]  No, I don't!
[01:27:41.794 --> 01:27:44.215]  Have multi-dimensional thinking, folks.
[01:27:44.215 --> 01:27:49.337]  The globalists who aren't Americans who want to destroy this country are funding the radical Muslims.
[01:27:49.337 --> 01:27:52.238]  And Glenn Beck yesterday was saying it's all George Soros.
[01:27:52.238 --> 01:27:53.938]  He's only a small part of it.
[01:27:53.938 --> 01:27:59.240]  Is George Soros, the Secretary of the Army, meeting and running Anwar al-Awlaki?
[01:27:59.240 --> 01:28:00.461]  No, Glenn!
[01:28:00.461 --> 01:28:00.761]  No!
[01:28:01.681 --> 01:28:05.023]  I'm risking my life to talk about this, folks.
[01:28:05.023 --> 01:28:06.264]  We've got the intel.
[01:28:06.264 --> 01:28:08.246]  We've got the proof.
[01:28:08.246 --> 01:28:12.128]  I appreciate your call, John.
[01:28:12.128 --> 01:28:13.889]  This stuff really starts to get to me at a certain point.
[01:28:13.889 --> 01:28:15.250]  It's just so out in the open.
[01:28:15.250 --> 01:28:16.451]  I can't believe it.
[01:28:16.451 --> 01:28:17.312]  I want it to stop.
[01:28:17.312 --> 01:28:19.653]  I want to get off this roller coaster.
[01:28:19.653 --> 01:28:21.395]  I want to get our country back.
[01:28:21.395 --> 01:28:27.158]  I just want to be free.
[01:28:27.158 --> 01:28:28.740]  Let's go ahead and talk to Noel in Illinois.
[01:28:28.740 --> 01:28:29.060]  Go ahead.
[01:28:30.524 --> 01:28:37.226]  Alex, man, it was a clear sky day about an hour ago and the aerosol sprays are hitting us pretty hard, man.
[01:28:37.226 --> 01:28:37.826]  It's crazy.
[01:28:37.826 --> 01:28:40.027]  People can't realize this.
[01:28:40.027 --> 01:28:42.748]  They're clearly zombies.
[01:28:42.748 --> 01:28:45.228]  Well, now the government wants to put lithium in the water.
[01:28:45.228 --> 01:28:48.169]  They know the aspartame is addictive and brain damages people.
[01:28:48.169 --> 01:28:51.990]  I mean, they're running full-spectrum black ops on us.
[01:28:51.990 --> 01:28:53.571]  The government loves us, Alex.
[01:28:53.571 --> 01:28:55.551]  What can I say?
[01:28:55.551 --> 01:28:56.712]  Quickly, you were talking about
[01:28:58.178 --> 01:29:02.499]  The blackouts in Texas, I mean, should we be shocked about this?
[01:29:02.499 --> 01:29:04.239]  The government's not going to protect us.
[01:29:04.239 --> 01:29:05.720]  Look what they did in Katrina.
[01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:08.700]  They put formaldehyde in their FEMA trailers.
[01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:18.583]  They're getting set for NLE 2011 about earthquakes in the New Madrid semiotic zone and FEMA Region 4, 5, 6, and 7.
[01:29:18.583 --> 01:29:21.843]  Our government clearly doesn't care about us.
[01:29:21.843 --> 01:29:23.904]  We have to get communities together.
[01:29:24.264 --> 01:29:25.805]  I agree, but I have to disagree.
[01:29:25.805 --> 01:29:28.065]  It's not that they don't just not care about us.
[01:29:28.065 --> 01:29:28.746]  They hate us.
[01:29:28.746 --> 01:29:30.106]  They want to get rid of us.
[01:29:30.106 --> 01:29:32.407]  It's official State Department policy, Memorandum 200.
[01:29:32.407 --> 01:29:35.868]  Yeah, we've got to... I'm trying to get communities together.
[01:29:35.868 --> 01:29:37.949]  I'm trying to warn people.
[01:29:37.949 --> 01:29:39.890]  And people say, well, why haven't the globalists killed you?
[01:29:39.890 --> 01:29:44.212]  Because if they kill me, it underlines, it highlights everything I've said and done.
[01:29:44.212 --> 01:29:48.073]  And my body of work is so huge, I will live on through it forever.
[01:29:48.073 --> 01:29:50.414]  I've basically said everything, covered every angle.
[01:29:51.240 --> 01:29:55.189]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[01:29:55.189 --> 01:29:57.855]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.221 --> 01:30:04.785]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[01:30:04.785 --> 01:30:05.926]  It ended on June of 2009.
[01:30:05.926 --> 01:30:10.491]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[01:30:10.491 --> 01:30:16.437]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[01:30:16.437 --> 01:30:18.599]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[01:30:18.599 --> 01:30:21.262]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[01:30:21.602 --> 01:30:28.104]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoodsDirect.
[01:30:28.104 --> 01:30:30.325]  They both make fabulous investments.
[01:30:30.325 --> 01:30:35.647]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[01:30:35.647 --> 01:30:40.948]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[01:30:40.948 --> 01:30:46.310]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[01:30:46.310 --> 01:30:49.251]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[01:30:49.491 --> 01:30:52.475]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[01:30:52.475 --> 01:30:53.276]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[01:31:04.801 --> 01:31:06.062]  Tyranny is here.
[01:31:06.062 --> 01:31:09.765]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:31:09.765 --> 01:31:12.227]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:31:12.227 --> 01:31:18.092]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[01:31:18.092 --> 01:31:24.337]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[01:31:24.757 --> 01:31:30.701]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[01:31:30.701 --> 01:31:34.904]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[01:31:34.904 --> 01:31:39.207]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:31:39.207 --> 01:31:45.152]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror, and cameras on every street corner.
[01:31:45.152 --> 01:31:48.714]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:31:48.714 --> 01:31:50.675]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:31:50.675 --> 01:31:51.116]  It's here.

[01:33:03.967 --> 01:33:08.951]  Defending the Republic from enemies foreign and domestic.
[01:33:08.951 --> 01:33:10.492]  It's Alex Jones!
[01:33:25.267 --> 01:33:28.169]  We're going to Max Keiser here in a moment.
[01:33:28.169 --> 01:33:29.710]  Here's the headlines on Drudge.
[01:33:29.710 --> 01:33:31.551]  They're also up on InfoWars.com.
[01:33:31.551 --> 01:33:33.072]  New World Trades.
[01:33:33.072 --> 01:33:36.134]  Global Stock Exchanges Head for Major Consolidation.
[01:33:42.717 --> 01:33:47.939]  London talks Canada, exchange chiefs seek new global powerhouses.
[01:33:47.939 --> 01:34:00.103]  The global government run by the private banks and Wall Street that have created these thousands of trillions of fake derivatives are now openly taking over and merging the stock markets.
[01:34:00.103 --> 01:34:07.366]  So we're going to be breaking that down with Max Keiser, who really needs no introduction here today.
[01:34:07.366 --> 01:34:11.187]  But before I go to Max, I want to tell you about some of our great sponsors.
[01:34:12.363 --> 01:34:15.467]  I want to tell you about ID Stronghold.
[01:34:15.467 --> 01:34:16.749]  You will just love these folks.
[01:34:16.749 --> 01:34:19.713]  They're the industry leaders in RFID blocking technology.
[01:34:19.713 --> 01:34:26.502]  We told you about this a decade ago, but now everybody's getting their credit card numbers stolen from thieves that can do it from, you know, down the street.
[01:34:26.502 --> 01:34:28.084]  And the globalists, of course, then will push for
[01:34:29.145 --> 01:34:29.365]  Bye!
[01:34:59.966 --> 01:35:02.068]  Continuing, Pure Water Freedom.
[01:35:02.068 --> 01:35:04.830]  I want to tell you about purewaterfreedom.com.
[01:35:04.830 --> 01:35:08.293]  If you want to affordably remove fluoride from your tap water, visit purewaterfreedom.com.

[01:35:15.218 --> 01:35:20.122]  They have a wide variety of filters to remove all types of toxins from your water, including shower and bath filters.
[01:35:20.122 --> 01:35:21.603]  All the filters are made in the USA.

[01:35:33.751 --> 01:35:35.673]  That's EndOfAmericaTheNumberThree.com.
[01:35:35.673 --> 01:35:42.757]  Stansbury & Associates Investment Research is an independent investment research firm founded in 99 with subscribers in more than 100 different countries.
[01:35:42.757 --> 01:35:47.400]  They recently created an eye-opening video you can see at EndOfAmericaTheNumberThree.com for free.
[01:35:47.400 --> 01:35:48.361]  That's free.
[01:35:48.361 --> 01:35:50.402]  Telling their biggest and most important prediction yet.
[01:35:51.923 --> 01:35:57.767]  And again, the website's inofamerica3.com, dealing with the end of the dollar as the world deserved currency.
[01:35:57.767 --> 01:35:59.728]  Check it all out today.
[01:35:59.728 --> 01:36:03.850]  We couldn't do it without our sponsors, but key information there.
[01:36:03.850 --> 01:36:16.777]  Obviously, Max Keiser does need no introduction, but he's the inventor of the Hollywood Stock Exchange virtual trading system, a virtual specialist technology prediction markets, Hollywood Stock Exchange, and the list goes on and on.
[01:36:16.777 --> 01:36:18.478]  TV host with BBC, RT,
[01:36:19.598 --> 01:36:23.861]  Al Jazeera, Press TV, Genesis Radio hosts Saturdays.
[01:36:23.861 --> 01:36:25.743]  It just goes on and on.
[01:36:25.743 --> 01:36:33.708]  Has a radio talk show in England, MaxKaiser.com, and he joins us to break down these big new developments with the global markets.
[01:36:33.708 --> 01:36:37.291]  He's predicted all of this, and so have we, but now it's here.
[01:36:37.291 --> 01:36:39.993]  Why is this happening, and how big of a deal is it, Max Kaiser?
[01:36:42.065 --> 01:36:48.049]  Well, the volume of these exchanges is collapsing, so they have to merge.
[01:36:48.049 --> 01:36:53.073]  And because of the legitimate volume, you know, most of the volume of the New York Stock Exchange is the U.S.
[01:36:53.073 --> 01:36:58.897]  government itself buying stocks to keep volumes on these exchanges.
[01:36:58.897 --> 01:37:06.723]  The actual underlying participation by the average person is just not there anymore because the economy is collapsing.
[01:37:07.523 --> 01:37:10.945]  The folks are not participating in the stock market like they used to.
[01:37:10.945 --> 01:37:13.086]  So there's huge mergers going on.
[01:37:13.086 --> 01:37:22.172]  And now you've got this international merger with the German Boris and the New York Stock Exchange coming together in an attempt to resuscitate a dying model.
[01:37:22.172 --> 01:37:24.513]  You know, the pre-market capitalism is dying.
[01:37:25.033 --> 01:37:33.698]  It's being replaced with a Politburo-style command-and-control economic modeling from the Fed, and now the global Fed, which is in the pipeline.
[01:37:33.698 --> 01:37:34.699]  We learned that at Davos.
[01:37:34.699 --> 01:37:44.204]  They're going to come up with a new $100 trillion credit line, and a global bank, and a global currency, because competition is dead.
[01:37:44.204 --> 01:37:45.845]  Nobody wants to compete anymore.
[01:37:45.845 --> 01:37:47.546]  They all want to be little dictators.
[01:37:47.546 --> 01:37:50.868]  So they've gotten rid of that concept, and now they've pulled us off.
[01:37:50.868 --> 01:37:54.470]  They've got to merge these exchanges and create just two or three super exchanges.
[01:37:54.989 --> 01:38:00.256]  Is that not just more layering of the debt, pushing the Bancar, SDR?
[01:38:00.256 --> 01:38:08.949]  You'll still have regional currencies, but they're going to be based in that new digital currency, and that gives them a new level to the Ponzi scheme, but how much time does that buy?
[01:38:10.390 --> 01:38:25.351]  Well, it rolls all the current debts into a new global hundred billion dollar debt facility, and as a way to prevent a collapse, but as countries lost their individual sovereignty during the creation of the euro.
[01:38:26.431 --> 01:38:28.372]  This means that countries like the U.S.
[01:38:28.372 --> 01:38:34.954]  lose its sovereignty in the creation of a global central bank and currency of some type.
[01:38:34.954 --> 01:38:44.378]  I think my preference is the SDR, I think will become increasingly more the special drawing right, which is already being used globally as a global currency.
[01:38:44.378 --> 01:38:48.780]  It gets bigger and is used more by countries around the world.
[01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:52.101]  Other people have different views on this, but I think the SDR is
[01:38:52.961 --> 01:38:55.402]  We're going to see that grow this year.
[01:38:55.402 --> 01:39:01.263]  And of course, the resistance is on the street pushing back.
[01:39:01.263 --> 01:39:09.465]  So you've got your audience, and your audience, you know, you're constantly asking the question, when will folks in the U.S.
[01:39:09.465 --> 01:39:09.945]  wake up?
[01:39:09.945 --> 01:39:15.066]  Well, they've woken up in Egypt, and they woke up in Tunisia, and they're waking up around the world.
[01:39:15.066 --> 01:39:19.647]  So the global insurrection against the banker occupation is alive and well.
[01:39:20.347 --> 01:39:29.113]  Well, we did predict three years ago, and since then, incessantly, that there would be global food riots and overthrow of governments.
[01:39:29.113 --> 01:39:30.274]  This is a complex issue.
[01:39:30.274 --> 01:39:33.136]  People say, well, Alex, the news is reporting that the U.S.
[01:39:33.136 --> 01:39:40.200]  government funded the Muslim Brotherhood, Ann Alberti, and the other factions, and did trigger this three weeks ago.
[01:39:40.200 --> 01:39:43.723]  Well, then how are you saying it's a real insurrection if they triggered it?
[01:39:43.723 --> 01:39:44.643]  They recognize
[01:39:45.524 --> 01:39:49.105]  The climate, they recognize that the dominoes are now set.
[01:39:49.105 --> 01:39:53.707]  They don't want it to fall over, triggered by real domestic groups.
[01:39:53.707 --> 01:39:57.648]  They artificially trigger it to then be able to try to steer it.
[01:39:57.648 --> 01:40:01.930]  The question is, will they be successful in doing that?
[01:40:01.930 --> 01:40:05.491]  And where do you see this global insurrection going?
[01:40:05.491 --> 01:40:11.233]  Obviously, it's triggered first in countries where half the population is making $2 a day or less and people are starving.
[01:40:11.233 --> 01:40:12.773]  Food riots are spreading.
[01:40:12.773 --> 01:40:14.234]  How do you see these dominoes falling?
[01:40:15.293 --> 01:40:22.339]  Right, so in Egypt, the number two guy who supposedly is taking over Mubarak is a CIA-friendly
[01:40:23.141 --> 01:40:34.427]  A chap who clearly would not make the situation better, but the people on the ground, the people in the street are pretty knowledgeable about this, so they're not going to accept that.
[01:40:34.427 --> 01:40:36.288]  And so that's the way a revolution is.
[01:40:36.288 --> 01:40:43.952]  Now this revolution is growing in scope and in size because now the workers across the country have gone on strike.
[01:40:43.952 --> 01:40:49.595]  As of yesterday, we've got workers around the Suez Canal and other parts of the country on strike.
[01:40:49.595 --> 01:40:51.836]  And when the workers go on strike, that's usually generally
[01:40:52.236 --> 01:40:55.819]  A huge step toward a successful revolution.
[01:40:55.819 --> 01:41:00.643]  And the intelligence that's being passed around is great because of the internet.
[01:41:00.643 --> 01:41:03.785]  And the country, of course, tried to hit the internet kill switch.
[01:41:03.785 --> 01:41:10.030]  But after three days, they realized that it's very difficult to hit the internet kill switch without also hitting the economic kill switch.
[01:41:10.578 --> 01:41:11.778]  So they had to turn it back on.
[01:41:11.778 --> 01:41:18.261]  So this is something that's been exploited by the insurrectionists, and it's the same all over the world.
[01:41:18.261 --> 01:41:29.124]  Well, that's because we're now in an industrialized world, and certainly with communications, Egypt is industrialized, not in many other respects, that now we are dependent on it.
[01:41:29.124 --> 01:41:30.665]  This is how we communicate.
[01:41:30.665 --> 01:41:32.666]  This is how the markets now move.
[01:41:32.666 --> 01:41:34.906]  This is how people purchase a lot of things.
[01:41:34.906 --> 01:41:37.087]  This is what businesses are based on.
[01:41:37.087 --> 01:41:38.908]  And so the globalists have built the web,
[01:41:39.708 --> 01:41:56.244]  As a surveillance grid, but now the populations are seizing it as a tool of liberty, and more and more I see the internet truly transcending what it was originally built for as a control tool, and I see this as one of the biggest cases of something backfiring on the New World Order.
[01:41:57.284 --> 01:42:04.189]  Well, you yourself have hacked the attempt to control the Internet by doing the Google Bomb.
[01:42:04.189 --> 01:42:04.469]  Okay?
[01:42:04.469 --> 01:42:15.697]  So, the Alex Jones Infowars audience, they launch a Google Bomb and it bypasses all the controls to keep the media sweet on a very narrow definition of what is news on that particular day.
[01:42:15.697 --> 01:42:26.364]  Now, I think going forward in the United States, if I can project what might happen in the U.S., which would fall into the category of an insurrection or a revolution similar to what we're seeing in
[01:42:26.964 --> 01:42:34.628]  I'm reading that more and more people in the U.S.
[01:42:34.628 --> 01:42:40.411]  whose houses are now underwater with the huge mortgages and the price of the real estate is down.
[01:42:40.411 --> 01:42:44.053]  They're just staying in the homes.
[01:42:44.053 --> 01:42:45.334]  They have the option in the U.S.
[01:42:45.334 --> 01:42:47.475]  of what's called jingle mail.
[01:42:47.475 --> 01:42:50.297]  You leave the key to the house in the mail.
[01:42:50.877 --> 01:43:07.973]  And you walk away from your mortgage, and people have selectively done this, and people in government have talked about, you know, produce the note, where's the note, foreclosure date, the banks that are involved in the foreclosure, they sold, mis-sold the mortgages to begin with, they mis-packaged the mortgages, etc.
[01:43:07.973 --> 01:43:16.280]  But what I'm hearing is that there is more and more of this, of an idea where you could have a million mortgage walk away on one day.
[01:43:17.682 --> 01:43:30.777]  So a million homeowners, or maybe just 100,000 homeowners, but possibly a million homeowners coast-to-coast in America, they pick a date in the future, two months from today, let's say, and they say, on that day, 100,000 of us or 200,000 of us will simultaneously
[01:43:33.400 --> 01:43:38.223]  Walk away from our underwater home, our bad mortgage.
[01:43:38.223 --> 01:43:44.347]  Now if that goes forward, then that will completely destroy the banking cartel in a huge way.
[01:43:44.347 --> 01:43:51.131]  And they're using the social networking site, and they're using the Facebook and the Twitter to organize a mass movement in that way.
[01:43:51.131 --> 01:43:57.635]  So that could be America's version of a global... to participate in a global insurrection against banker occupation.
[01:43:58.055 --> 01:44:00.356]  I want to expand on something.
[01:44:00.356 --> 01:44:07.359]  The head of the Energy Department has announced yesterday that they are going to, quote, shut down massive numbers of power plants in the U.S.
[01:44:07.359 --> 01:44:18.183]  Last Friday, the White House on the front page responded to our story about how they're shutting down other power plants but letting GE have a waiver and keep theirs open and expand new ones.
[01:44:18.183 --> 01:44:21.645]  So regardless of where you stand on global warming, this is selective
[01:44:22.345 --> 01:44:27.147]  Uh, energy shutdowns for the guys that are on the inside of the cartel.
[01:44:27.147 --> 01:44:36.531]  That's what Ceausescu did for his own profit, uh, more than tripling prices and, and shutting down his competition in Romania.
[01:44:36.531 --> 01:44:39.792]  That's directly what led to his, uh, overthrow.
[01:44:39.792 --> 01:44:47.596]  We're seeing rebellions all over the world now, uh, including in China over people's electricity cutting in and out.
[01:44:47.596 --> 01:44:47.676]  Uh,
[01:44:48.596 --> 01:44:53.800]  Well, you mentioned Enron earlier and what happened in California a few years ago.
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:58.844]  They just went ahead and jacked up rates and caused a tremendous amount of pain.
[01:45:07.102 --> 01:45:10.144]  Just by gouging prices to manipulate the prices.
[01:45:10.144 --> 01:45:19.091]  What's going on in Texas right now with the power outages, I would not be surprised to find out that this is in fact just more of the same kind of price gouging.
[01:45:19.091 --> 01:45:22.154]  Energy companies gouging prices for profit.
[01:45:22.154 --> 01:45:28.359]  But looking at the whole situation from a more broader perspective, remember that when the U.S.
[01:45:28.359 --> 01:45:32.322]  went off the gold standard in 1971, they adopted what was called the petrodollar standard.
[01:45:32.822 --> 01:45:33.802]  The U.S.
[01:45:33.802 --> 01:45:36.963]  and Saudi Arabia had a quid pro quo that the U.S.
[01:45:36.963 --> 01:45:42.084]  would buy lots of oil from Saudi Arabia if they recycled that money through the U.S.
[01:45:42.084 --> 01:45:42.964]  economy.
[01:45:42.964 --> 01:45:52.246]  And this gave birth to a tremendous 30-year period of growth of globalization and growth of credit to finance this globalization.
[01:45:52.246 --> 01:45:54.906]  That would be the growth of the dollar as the world reserve currency.
[01:45:54.906 --> 01:45:57.727]  Now, starting in 2007, we know that we had a credit crunch.
[01:45:58.297 --> 01:46:00.399]  Lehman Brothers went bad.
[01:46:00.399 --> 01:46:01.680]  Golden Sacks almost went bust.
[01:46:01.680 --> 01:46:03.922]  They're going for Hank Paul for bailing them out for Congress.
[01:46:03.922 --> 01:46:05.623]  Banks all over the world almost went bust.
[01:46:05.623 --> 01:46:10.967]  Because all the credit that's been created since 1971, the globe hit peak credit.
[01:46:10.967 --> 01:46:13.309]  They had all the credit saturation.
[01:46:13.309 --> 01:46:15.571]  You can't absorb any more credit.
[01:46:16.053 --> 01:46:27.621]  And this is the story that it's impossible, no matter how much more money that Beranke creates, they cannot re-stimulate the economy to go back to where they were 10 or 15 years ago.
[01:46:27.621 --> 01:46:38.168]  Which means that the energy path, which has been codependent, growing codependently along with the credit growth, is also in a contraction phase.
[01:46:38.860 --> 01:46:42.004]  So, Saudi Arabia just came out two days ago.
[01:46:42.004 --> 01:46:48.952]  They said that they've been overstating their reserves by 40%, which we reported on in our Al Jazeera English film four years ago.
[01:46:48.952 --> 01:46:54.299]  The energy supplies of these three major fields, the Gawar in Saudi Arabia, Cantarella in Mexico,
[01:46:54.899 --> 01:46:58.220]  And Bergen and Kuwait have all been in rapid decline.
[01:46:58.220 --> 01:47:00.320]  Mexico is now an oil importer.
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:02.021]  The UK is now an oil importer.
[01:47:02.021 --> 01:47:05.121]  Egypt, just this year, became an oil importer.
[01:47:05.121 --> 01:47:09.442]  That's part of the reason why now inflation is running high and the people are on the streets.
[01:47:09.442 --> 01:47:15.764]  Because the entire energy sector, along with the credit sector, take those two together, they're both collapsing.
[01:47:15.764 --> 01:47:17.244]  They're both co-terminus.
[01:47:17.244 --> 01:47:20.105]  You've got a credit and energy collapse simultaneously.
[01:47:20.532 --> 01:47:24.557]  And the people are simply at the end of their tether.
[01:47:24.557 --> 01:47:31.766]  They're on the street now and it's no going back because you're never going to get the credit back and you're not going to get those reserves back at that price.
[01:47:34.651 --> 01:47:44.897]  All the analysts I respect going back when I really woke up 18, 19 years ago, I've been on air 16 years, said that the globalists are going to flood the world with derivatives.
[01:47:44.897 --> 01:47:47.099]  I mean, I was talking about this 13 years ago.
[01:47:47.099 --> 01:47:53.222]  I had economists like George Humphrey on 12 years ago who broke down everything that's now happened with total precision.
[01:47:53.222 --> 01:47:58.526]  He wrote books about how it was going to unfold, that the globalists would sell globalism
[01:47:59.482 --> 01:48:21.578]  Through all this fiat fraudulent wealth they made, but that they plan to implode it later, cause world revolution, but actually misdirect it against the nation states themselves, bring the world into greater crisis, just like the IMF and World Bank do in third world countries, triggering the IMF riot as they call it, and then offer their global currency as the solution
[01:48:22.418 --> 01:48:28.286]  That's what Davos did, as you know, two weeks ago with the $100 trillion they want of taxpayer money to save us.
[01:48:28.286 --> 01:48:31.810]  They'll then leverage it at least 10 times to $1 quadrillion.
[01:48:31.810 --> 01:48:37.777]  I mean, this has really been an organized system because it's on paper that they organized it.
[01:48:37.777 --> 01:48:41.062]  I mean, do you disagree that the big central banks have planned all of this?
[01:48:42.403 --> 01:48:56.288]  No, I don't disagree because any money that has interest attached to it, there's an incentive to flood the market with as much of it as possible because you're always ahead of the curve in terms of the amount of interest you're going to collect versus any liability associated with the debts you're incurring.
[01:48:56.795 --> 01:49:07.028]  So, money with interest attached is something that these banks and these central banks flood the globe with because they know it's a form of, it's a soft imperial conquest.
[01:49:07.028 --> 01:49:07.828]  They don't need it.
[01:49:07.828 --> 01:49:13.836]  You know, when people talk about the currency wars that are going on now, the US is using artificially cheap US dollars
[01:49:14.196 --> 01:49:14.656]  I think so.
[01:49:33.871 --> 01:49:43.838]  And the Chinese have the incredibly soft yawn to underpin the United States and de-industrialize us.
[01:49:45.253 --> 01:49:46.794]  Well, that's part of the currency war.
[01:49:46.794 --> 01:49:55.280]  Now, what's coming out recently with Robert Zoellick now coming out and saying, we're going to look at gold again, and with J.P.
[01:49:55.280 --> 01:50:03.125]  Morgan just recently said that they're going to recognize gold bullion as collateral for derivatives for the first time they've made that statement.
[01:50:03.125 --> 01:50:08.048]  So now suddenly gold and silver are being talked about in terms of a currency.
[01:50:08.528 --> 01:50:09.709]  This hasn't been on.
[01:50:09.709 --> 01:50:14.412]  And the central banks, for the past 30 years, have been net sellers of gold.
[01:50:14.412 --> 01:50:16.333]  Now they're net buyers of gold.
[01:50:16.333 --> 01:50:22.898]  So this is now setting the stage for this huge showdown between which country has the most gold.
[01:50:22.898 --> 01:50:26.200]  And of course, the U.S., purportedly, has 8,000 tons.
[01:50:26.200 --> 01:50:27.921]  China has only 1,000 tons.
[01:50:27.921 --> 01:50:30.903]  Germany has 3,000 tons, but 66% of that is held in New York.
[01:50:31.663 --> 01:50:41.287]  And as was the point made recently by a very, very smart guy, Jim Rickert, who you should have on your show, the gold in New York could be commandeered by the U.S.
[01:50:41.287 --> 01:50:42.028]  so that the U.S.
[01:50:42.028 --> 01:50:44.389]  now has suddenly 14,000 tons of gold.
[01:50:44.389 --> 01:50:48.930]  They become, as Rickert refers to it, the Saudi Arabia of gold.
[01:50:48.930 --> 01:50:51.511]  So gold becomes a big factor.
[01:50:51.511 --> 01:50:53.392]  All right, stay there!
[01:50:53.392 --> 01:50:57.214]  Let's talk about gold and silver on the other side and where you see that trend going.
[01:51:01.559 --> 01:51:04.141]  Never buy home canning jar lids again!
[01:51:04.141 --> 01:51:04.822]  No kidding!
[01:51:04.822 --> 01:51:09.206]  When you buy Tadler Reusable Canning Lids once, you'll never buy canning lids ever again.
[01:51:09.206 --> 01:51:11.968]  Safely store emergency preparedness foods for years.
[01:51:11.968 --> 01:51:15.431]  Traditional metal lids are single-use throwaways containing BPA.
[01:51:15.431 --> 01:51:20.456]  But Tadler Reusable Canning Lids are guaranteed to last a lifetime when used as design for home canning.
[01:51:20.456 --> 01:51:23.979]  Tadler Lids are made with a USDA and FDA approved food grade plastic.
[01:51:24.239 --> 01:51:24.539]  I think so.
[01:51:44.565 --> 01:51:44.645]  877-747-2793.
[01:51:44.645 --> 01:51:46.326]  Call 877-747-2793 or go to ReusableCanningLids.com.
[01:51:46.326 --> 01:51:49.588]  That's ReusableCanningLids.com for Tadler Reusable Canning Lids, the original since 1976.
[01:52:01.052 --> 01:52:02.353]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:02.353 --> 01:52:07.958]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.958 --> 01:52:12.983]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.983 --> 01:52:18.008]  It's true, seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible they could even happen again.
[01:52:18.548 --> 01:52:23.775]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.775 --> 01:52:30.883]  They call it a survival seed bank, and it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:30.883 --> 01:52:32.004]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:32.004 --> 01:52:38.372]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way, and you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:38.672 --> 01:52:41.855]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:41.855 --> 01:52:44.096]  That's survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:44.096 --> 01:52:44.877]  Or give them a call at 877-327-0365.
[01:52:44.877 --> 01:52:45.177]  That's 877-327-0365.
[01:52:45.177 --> 01:52:48.660]  Remember, in a real crisis, non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:48.660 --> 01:52:50.401]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.
[01:53:01.167 --> 01:53:04.571]  Strength, energy, and endurance are all synonymous with youth.
[01:53:04.571 --> 01:53:06.353]  Would you like to feel youthful again?
[01:53:06.353 --> 01:53:10.617]  Protein absorption and synthesis are at the foundation of strength, energy, and endurance.
[01:53:10.617 --> 01:53:18.706]  Insults to your intestinal lining from drugs, heavy metals, bad diet, and age can inhibit your absorption of amino acids from your protein foods.
[01:53:18.706 --> 01:53:21.589]  This causes your body to repair slowly and be prone to injury.
[01:53:21.969 --> 01:53:27.936]  By taking a highly digestible protein into your body you can greatly increase your repair rate and energy level.
[01:53:27.936 --> 01:53:31.840]  One World Whey Protein Powder is more digestible than milk or eggs.
[01:53:31.840 --> 01:53:37.707]  One World Whey is the first ever truly unheated whey protein powder from grass-fed cows on the market.
[01:53:37.707 --> 01:53:42.292]  Whether you like to exercise, want more energy, want greater strength, or just want to feel better.
[01:53:42.592 --> 01:53:44.794]  One World Way is a must for you to try.

[01:53:50.398 --> 01:53:53.380]  That's oneworld, W-H-E-Y dot com.
[01:53:53.380 --> 01:53:54.181]  Or call 888-988-3325.
[01:53:54.181 --> 01:53:54.421]  That's 888-988-3325.
[01:53:54.421 --> 01:53:57.303]  Stuart Rhodes is going to be in studio with us coming up at 8 after.
[01:53:57.303 --> 01:53:58.744]  Next hour, founder of Oath Keepers.
[01:54:09.893 --> 01:54:14.617]  And we're going to cover some new information they've learned and also some new initiatives they've launched.
[01:54:14.617 --> 01:54:20.602]  Tarpley's popping in for only five minutes in the next segment to give us his take on Egypt.
[01:54:20.602 --> 01:54:25.646]  And Mubarak, now they're announcing, will be stepping down, reportedly not in September, but in the next few days.
[01:54:25.646 --> 01:54:31.751]  Who knows if that's another hoax, but Fox News, AP, they're all reporting it right now.
[01:54:31.751 --> 01:54:36.054]  Finishing up with Max Keiser, going back to gold and silver.
[01:54:36.795 --> 01:54:52.981]  If you look at the 10-year graph, 11-year graph, obviously gold and silver is going straight up, but they have these little dips, and it's even, as you know, coming out in lawsuits that the Federal Reserve and others are trying to suppress the price of these, but at the same time buying it up themselves.
[01:54:52.981 --> 01:54:55.002]  What do you see happening with the gold and silver markets?
[01:54:56.038 --> 01:54:56.658]  Well, a couple things.
[01:54:56.658 --> 01:55:00.880]  First of all, I was in London a couple weeks ago, and I met in person with Andrew McGuire.
[01:55:00.880 --> 01:55:11.384]  You know, he was the whistleblower in London who blew the whistle on the gold and silver suppression scheme of HSBC and JPMorgan.
[01:55:11.384 --> 01:55:16.526]  And he told me that he's coming out with some new information that will put people in jail.
[01:55:16.526 --> 01:55:20.728]  But he's currently unable to talk about it.
[01:55:20.728 --> 01:55:24.109]  Well, they've already tried to kill him with that set-up car wreck.
[01:55:24.109 --> 01:55:25.490]  He better dump the intel now.
[01:55:26.451 --> 01:55:29.613]  That's right, he got hit by a car the next day.
[01:55:29.613 --> 01:55:40.820]  And I told him that I'm going to have him on my show first, but then I said, I talked to you, and you've got to get on the Alex Jones Show immediately, and he's like, yes, of course.
[01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:42.081]  So that's yet to come.
[01:55:42.081 --> 01:55:50.747]  So as soon as you have him on your show, since you know more about this than I do, how about I just have you on with him, Max, I mean like the day after he's on your RT show?
[01:55:51.960 --> 01:55:53.781]  Yeah, this is all coming down the pike.
[01:55:53.781 --> 01:55:56.002]  So your audience, my audience, we're going to get this information.
[01:55:56.002 --> 01:56:02.746]  You just programmed that with my producer, so just you know when this is coming out on your show, I guess on a Friday, and then let's just have you and him on Monday.
[01:56:02.746 --> 01:56:03.806]  So you line it up.
[01:56:03.806 --> 01:56:04.967]  You haunt your audience.
[01:56:04.967 --> 01:56:06.788]  Total bombshell information.
[01:56:06.788 --> 01:56:11.230]  Gold and silver for the last 10 years have been averaging 21-22% annualized gains.
[01:56:11.230 --> 01:56:13.832]  It's been in the beginning of a bull market.
[01:56:14.412 --> 01:56:22.558]  We're about ready to start phase two of a bull market, which means you're going to see the big, juicy gains, parabolic gains that are coming up.
[01:56:22.558 --> 01:56:30.162]  But the point I was making before the break is that the world has always been on a gold standard.
[01:56:30.162 --> 01:56:33.265]  In 1971, when the U.S.
[01:56:33.265 --> 01:56:38.968]  closed the gold window, we entered an experiment of global fiat currency that traded against each other.
[01:56:38.968 --> 01:56:41.450]  That experiment now, as of 2010-2011, has proved to be a failure.
[01:56:44.530 --> 01:56:49.515]  Well, I'm going to go back to this bombshell.
[01:56:49.515 --> 01:57:06.413]  Tell folks again, briefly, we've only got a few minutes left, who this whistleblower is, where he worked, what that caused, and obviously you're hinting his bombshell is that the system is already waiting and knows, just like you told us two years before the Icelandic implosion, you met with bankers who bragged about it.
[01:57:07.136 --> 01:57:11.499]  No, I told you that Facebook was going to launch a global currency a year before they did.
[01:57:11.499 --> 01:57:12.320]  Yes.
[01:57:12.320 --> 01:57:15.042]  We know you're 100% real, so we've got two minutes.
[01:57:15.042 --> 01:57:17.464]  Tell us what's happening.
[01:57:17.464 --> 01:57:18.645]  Yeah, well, okay.
[01:57:18.645 --> 01:57:24.849]  Andrew McGuire, you know, as we've been talking about, he gave some evidence about the London Billing Markets Association.
[01:57:24.849 --> 01:57:27.191]  He said, I can show you how they manipulate prices.
[01:57:27.191 --> 01:57:30.574]  He said in advance how prices were going to be manipulated.
[01:57:30.574 --> 01:57:34.797]  And sure enough, exactly what he said he was going to do exactly is what happened.
[01:57:35.297 --> 01:57:39.480]  And, um, they set up a, uh, they don't, they didn't broadcast that information.
[01:57:39.480 --> 01:57:41.962]  Uh, he's putting out some additional information.
[01:57:41.962 --> 01:57:50.648]  He got the goods about how these banks are participating in fraudulently keeping the price artificially suppressed, and J.P.
[01:57:50.648 --> 01:57:54.591]  Morgan's huge, multi-billion short silver position.
[01:57:54.591 --> 01:57:56.873]  You know, they're short something like 3 billion ounces, and they're
[01:57:57.313 --> 01:57:57.513]  Okay!
[01:58:25.114 --> 01:58:26.794]  How long till the bombshell comes out?
[01:58:26.794 --> 01:58:30.775]  Because this is very dangerous what you're reporting, obviously.
[01:58:30.775 --> 01:58:33.276]  A few weeks.
[01:58:33.276 --> 01:58:35.796]  Alright, Max, you better watch your back, man.
[01:58:35.796 --> 01:58:42.678]  You better tell Mr. McGuire, he better get this information out faster.
[01:58:42.678 --> 01:58:46.258]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:46.258 --> 01:58:48.299]  Visit GCNlive.com today.
[01:58:51.035 --> 01:58:55.576]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:55.576 --> 01:58:56.496]  Number 1.
[01:58:56.496 --> 01:58:59.917]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.917 --> 01:59:00.777]  Number 2.
[01:59:00.777 --> 01:59:05.658]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:05.658 --> 01:59:06.398]  It's true.
[01:59:06.398 --> 01:59:11.279]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:11.279 --> 01:59:12.099]  Number 3.
[01:59:12.099 --> 01:59:15.679]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:15.679 --> 01:59:19.380]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:19.600 --> 01:59:20.400]  Number 4.
[01:59:20.400 --> 01:59:23.141]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:23.141 --> 01:59:26.841]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:26.841 --> 01:59:27.621]  Number 5.
[01:59:27.621 --> 01:59:31.762]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.762 --> 01:59:36.823]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.823 --> 01:59:40.984]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:40.984 --> 01:59:42.784]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:42.784 --> 01:59:47.385]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com, or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:59:48.506 --> 01:59:56.452]  877-327-0365 Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.452 --> 01:59:59.235]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.765 --> 02:00:07.066]  Big Brother.
[02:00:07.066 --> 02:00:08.846]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.846 --> 02:00:10.607]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.607 --> 02:00:12.188]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.188 --> 02:00:14.109]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.109 --> 02:00:17.930]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.930 --> 02:00:21.972]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:23.516 --> 02:00:25.197]  All right, we're now into hour number three.
[02:00:25.197 --> 02:00:30.962]  We've only got Mr. T., Webster Tarpley, historian and economist, on for five minutes.
[02:00:30.962 --> 02:00:35.886]  I'm probably going to try to get him on tomorrow or the next few days because he's been breaking down what's happening in Egypt.
[02:00:35.886 --> 02:00:37.507]  They're now saying Mubarak will step down.
[02:00:37.507 --> 02:00:41.050]  I've been hearing that for three weeks, but it looks like he probably is this time.
[02:00:41.050 --> 02:00:46.574]  Webster, briefly, give us your analysis and breakdown of what's happening right now in Egypt.
[02:00:46.974 --> 02:00:49.277]  Well, this is a CIA military coup.
[02:00:49.277 --> 02:00:55.965]  It was announced in Washington this morning by Leon Panetta, the head of the CIA, in testimony to the House Intelligence Committee.
[02:00:55.965 --> 02:00:58.127]  He said, Mubarak is going to be out today.
[02:00:58.127 --> 02:01:01.291]  So it's all organized behind the scenes.
[02:01:01.291 --> 02:01:03.293]  The people in the foreground, this gaggle of
[02:01:04.114 --> 02:01:06.036]  Anarchists and dupes in the square.
[02:01:06.036 --> 02:01:07.518]  These people are the walk-ons.
[02:01:07.518 --> 02:01:09.240]  They're the props, if you will.
[02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:12.002]  They're what makes this plausible to the average person.
[02:01:12.002 --> 02:01:15.986]  But what's going on is a good old-fashioned military coup.
[02:01:15.986 --> 02:01:27.118]  Now, the question is, will it be Suleiman, the CIA contact man, ruling alone, or will it be a military junta, which would include this guy Kantawi, the defense minister,
[02:01:27.638 --> 02:01:31.059]  And the Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces, General Ainan.
[02:01:31.059 --> 02:01:33.899]  So this is, again, a military push.
[02:01:33.899 --> 02:01:37.420]  Now, the big issue is why, and more research reveals why.
[02:01:37.420 --> 02:01:39.200]  Mubarak had been fighting the U.S.
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:40.660]  on many issues.
[02:01:40.660 --> 02:01:43.101]  In August of 2009, the U.S.
[02:01:43.101 --> 02:01:45.081]  had demanded a U.S.
[02:01:45.081 --> 02:01:51.102]  nuclear umbrella for Israel, Egypt, the Saudis, and the Emirates of the Gulf, all against Iran.
[02:01:51.102 --> 02:01:56.343]  This would be to create that Arab, Sunni, and Israel, and U.S.
[02:01:56.343 --> 02:01:56.603]  front
[02:01:57.203 --> 02:01:58.104]  Against the Iranians.
[02:01:58.104 --> 02:01:59.384]  And Mubarak said no.
[02:01:59.384 --> 02:02:00.245]  He rejected it.
[02:02:00.245 --> 02:02:06.168]  He said, I will not normalize with Israel unless I negotiate directly with them and get certain things in return.
[02:02:06.168 --> 02:02:09.230]  And that encouraged the Saudis to also say no.
[02:02:09.230 --> 02:02:12.351]  There's also a conflict about what's going to happen in Lebanon.
[02:02:12.351 --> 02:02:17.254]  Mubarak has been saying, I don't want the future of Lebanon determined by this fake report
[02:02:17.774 --> 02:02:18.074]  Of course.
[02:02:35.401 --> 02:02:47.050]  Obama called Mubarak and thanked him for supporting the commission, which was a pretty heavy-handed warning, I guess, because it's clear that Mubarak is not supporting the commission.
[02:02:47.050 --> 02:02:50.633]  This track record goes way back in late 2006.
[02:02:50.633 --> 02:02:53.216]  Mubarak was saying, it's too soon for the U.S.
[02:02:53.216 --> 02:02:54.337]  to leave Iraq.
[02:02:54.337 --> 02:02:55.778]  Stop leaving Iraq.
[02:02:55.778 --> 02:02:59.681]  You're making me, you know, less secure.
[02:02:59.681 --> 02:03:03.004]  The general idea is that Mubarak wants the status quo.
[02:03:05.965 --> 02:03:08.307]  So he's like Admiral Fox Fallon three years ago.
[02:03:08.307 --> 02:03:09.587]  He doesn't want World War III.
[02:03:09.587 --> 02:03:10.288]  He's a butcher.
[02:03:10.288 --> 02:03:11.348]  He's a thug.
[02:03:11.348 --> 02:03:12.649]  He's a torturer.
[02:03:12.649 --> 02:03:19.152]  But he wouldn't get in line for World War III and the strategic attacks on Iran.
[02:03:19.152 --> 02:03:22.054]  And so they're sending a message to Jordan.
[02:03:22.054 --> 02:03:23.855]  They're sending a message to Saudi Arabia.
[02:03:23.855 --> 02:03:26.576]  They're sending a message to Yemen, to everybody else.
[02:03:26.576 --> 02:03:30.178]  You do what we say or we will trigger your overthrows right now.
[02:03:30.478 --> 02:03:34.259]  Yes, and the result is now that the attack on Iran comes closer.
[02:03:34.259 --> 02:03:36.499]  That's the wonderful thing in tomorrow's.
[02:03:36.499 --> 02:03:56.244]  Out of all of these young dupes in the square, what they have done is, if this happens, if this goes through, because it may not, Annette may be talking through her hat, and the networks may be talking through their hat, but if this goes through, the war with Iran becomes easier, because Egypt is eliminated as somebody saying, no, we're not interested.
[02:03:56.864 --> 02:04:04.129]  The Saudis at that point may cave, and at that point you've got pretty much a clear path to have the war with Iran.
[02:04:26.704 --> 02:04:28.606]  Whatever you need, sure.
[02:04:28.606 --> 02:04:29.446]  Either one.
[02:04:29.446 --> 02:04:30.767]  Whichever is more convenient.
[02:04:30.767 --> 02:04:40.916]  We will call you in 55 minutes and we'll do two segments where you can, from the beginning, read the actual quotes of Panetta, the London Telegraph three weeks ago saying the U.S.
[02:04:40.916 --> 02:04:48.182]  was doing this, and what this signifies, that Panetta would announce they're about to fall and then it's announced.
[02:04:48.182 --> 02:04:49.443]  This is unbelievable.
[02:04:49.443 --> 02:04:50.805]  Meanwhile, Glenn Beck's claiming that
[02:04:51.892 --> 02:04:55.353]  George Soros is running all this, and at certain levels, I guess he is.
[02:04:55.353 --> 02:04:57.873]  We'll break all that down with you coming up.
[02:04:57.873 --> 02:04:58.173]  55 minutes.
[02:04:58.173 --> 02:04:59.714]  Stuart Rhodes is straight ahead.
[02:04:59.714 --> 02:05:01.454]  Webster, stand by.
[02:05:01.454 --> 02:05:05.035]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:05:05.035 --> 02:05:06.155]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:05:06.155 --> 02:05:10.716]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:05:10.716 --> 02:05:16.657]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:05:16.657 --> 02:05:18.817]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:05:18.817 --> 02:05:21.498]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:05:21.838 --> 02:05:28.342]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:05:28.342 --> 02:05:30.563]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:05:30.563 --> 02:05:35.886]  Food is our greatest dependency, and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:05:35.886 --> 02:05:41.188]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis, and you can't eat paper, stocks, or metals.
[02:05:41.188 --> 02:05:46.551]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious, easy-fix meals to enjoy now or save for long-term.
[02:05:46.551 --> 02:05:49.493]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.
[02:05:49.733 --> 02:05:52.735]  Visit efoodsdirect.com on the internet or call 800-409-5633.
[02:05:52.735 --> 02:05:53.515]  That's efoodsdirect.com or 800-409-5633.
[02:05:53.515 --> 02:05:54.095]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:05:54.095 --> 02:05:57.477]  citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:06:08.923 --> 02:06:11.484]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:06:11.484 --> 02:06:16.866]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:06:16.866 --> 02:06:19.907]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:06:19.907 --> 02:06:22.208]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:06:22.208 --> 02:06:28.471]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:06:28.471 --> 02:06:31.852]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:06:31.852 --> 02:06:37.334]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:06:37.614 --> 02:06:39.255]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:06:39.255 --> 02:06:40.556]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:06:40.556 --> 02:06:43.238]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:06:43.238 --> 02:06:47.460]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:06:47.460 --> 02:06:52.084]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:06:52.084 --> 02:06:54.665]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[02:07:02.401 --> 02:07:06.382]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:06.382 --> 02:07:15.223]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[02:07:15.223 --> 02:07:19.864]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[02:07:19.864 --> 02:07:30.666]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[02:07:31.306 --> 02:07:40.828]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nanosilver products, you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:40.828 --> 02:07:46.250]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[02:07:46.250 --> 02:07:53.731]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[02:07:53.731 --> 02:07:56.152]  That's www.silverlungs.com.
[02:08:05.970 --> 02:08:07.292]  Big Brother.
[02:08:07.292 --> 02:08:09.054]  Mainstream media.
[02:08:09.054 --> 02:08:10.816]  Government cover-ups.
[02:08:10.816 --> 02:08:12.418]  You want answers?
[02:08:12.418 --> 02:08:13.960]  Well, so does he.
[02:08:13.960 --> 02:08:18.144]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:18.144 --> 02:08:22.229]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:08:22.890 --> 02:08:25.332]  We're back live eight minutes into this third hour.
[02:08:25.332 --> 02:08:35.400]  We're going into overdrive in the fourth hour when historian Webster Tarpley will give you the entire intel dump on what's going on in Egypt with the announcement that Mubarak will be stepping down.
[02:08:35.400 --> 02:08:43.507]  The head of the CIA said early this morning in an intelligence public meeting then it was announced that Mubarak would be stepping down.
[02:08:43.507 --> 02:08:49.632]  Why would our government be kicking out their own dictator and trying to put in the Muslim Brotherhood who say break your treaties with Israel?
[02:08:49.932 --> 02:08:57.284]  Because they're getting ready to destabilize the Middle East and try to kick off World War III, as the Rand Corporation reported two years ago, and we warned you.
[02:08:57.284 --> 02:09:00.610]  Okay, this is serious, serious, serious.
[02:09:00.610 --> 02:09:02.733]  The globalists run the radical Muslims.
[02:09:03.507 --> 02:09:09.492]  They're saying Amwar al-Awlaki is set to hit us any day that the terror threat is as high as it's ever been since 9-11.
[02:09:09.492 --> 02:09:13.114]  That's because they didn't reauthorize the Patriot Act yesterday or two days ago.
[02:09:13.114 --> 02:09:17.598]  Napolitano, the head of Homeland Security, responds saying he's going to hit us.
[02:09:17.598 --> 02:09:22.942]  But Fox News and AP Report headline Amwar al-Awlaki dying secretly at the Pentagon.
[02:09:23.422 --> 02:09:28.305]  Two months after 9-11, when he is known as the number three in Al Qaeda.
[02:09:28.305 --> 02:09:34.529]  Now CBS is saying, and Homeland Security is saying he's now number one, replacing him as the new Bin Laden.
[02:09:35.740 --> 02:09:40.403]  It turns out he was running the Fort Hood shooting, the Times Square attack, the underwear bombing, the shoe bombing.
[02:09:40.403 --> 02:09:41.743]  They admit all that.
[02:09:41.743 --> 02:09:44.205]  And then it's admitted the State Department helped him get on the plane.
[02:09:44.205 --> 02:09:45.966]  They are running this out in the open.
[02:09:45.966 --> 02:09:47.186]  And they're getting ready.
[02:09:47.186 --> 02:09:54.270]  That's why they've told the cops for two years, get ready for IED attacks, get ready for machine gun attacks on police stations.
[02:09:54.270 --> 02:10:00.314]  To get the police fully behind martial law, they're preparing low-intensity attacks all over the country.
[02:10:00.934 --> 02:10:04.817]  And this new model is not the government purely staging attacks.
[02:10:04.817 --> 02:10:06.978]  It's going out and finding lunatics.
[02:10:06.978 --> 02:10:15.363]  Generally, people who weren't originally Arab, people with names like Johnson or Martinez, who they profile as complete lunatics.
[02:10:15.363 --> 02:10:18.345]  And then they give them the weapons, the bombs, and say, go at it!
[02:10:19.085 --> 02:10:31.691]  And so that's the one good news is these people are such low-level operators mentally that they usually can't even point a gun properly and fire it or can't even get the bombs planted.
[02:10:31.691 --> 02:10:34.492]  So we've analyzed this attack profile.
[02:10:34.492 --> 02:10:36.734]  It's very serious.
[02:10:36.734 --> 02:10:40.735]  And I told you yesterday they were about to announce Al-Awlaki is going to get you and they're now doing that.
[02:10:40.735 --> 02:10:43.517]  I want to talk about that first with Stuart Rhodes.
[02:10:43.517 --> 02:10:44.657]  He joins us here.
[02:10:44.657 --> 02:10:45.398]  He is the founder.
[02:10:46.258 --> 02:10:46.619]  Of course.
[02:11:06.401 --> 02:11:12.986]  Where his paper solving the puzzle of enemy combatant status won Yale's Miller Prize for best paper in Bill of Rights.
[02:11:12.986 --> 02:11:20.412]  He assisted teaching US military history at Yale, was a Yale research scholar, and is writing a book on the dangers of applying the laws of war to the American people.
[02:11:20.412 --> 02:11:21.793]  And he heads up Oath Keepers.
[02:11:21.793 --> 02:11:27.157]  Stuart, for those that don't know who you are, tell them briefly about Oath Keepers, then break down what I was just talking about.
[02:11:27.157 --> 02:11:30.360]  I've confirmed through multiple military sources, plus we have public admissions,
[02:11:30.660 --> 02:11:37.708]  They are training National Guard, State Guard, regular Army Marines to set up checkpoints, run IDs, and put people on Army trucks.
[02:11:37.708 --> 02:11:42.113]  They're announcing the EAS system will start having government announcements at 9,000 locations.
[02:11:42.113 --> 02:11:44.916]  Government telescreens are going in saying, watch your neighbors.
[02:11:44.916 --> 02:11:46.978]  We are entering 1984.
[02:11:46.978 --> 02:11:48.159]  Break down what you think's happening.
[02:11:48.720 --> 02:11:58.969]  Well, the mission of Oath Keepers is to remind the current serving of their oath to support and defend the Constitution and to stand down and refuse unlawful orders because tyranny can't come without their cooperation.
[02:11:58.969 --> 02:12:06.455]  As we just saw in Tunisia, when the military withdraws its consent and cooperation, the dictator truly has no clothes and can do nothing.
[02:12:06.795 --> 02:12:09.416]  That's what your tens of thousands of contacts are confirming for you.
[02:12:36.604 --> 02:12:37.886]  So we're hearing that from different places.
[02:12:37.886 --> 02:12:40.389]  You hear from one guy, it's scuttlebutt.
[02:12:40.389 --> 02:12:44.333]  But you hear from eight, nine different places, little pings coming in, saying the same thing.
[02:12:44.333 --> 02:12:49.740]  They know a collapse is coming, they're getting ready for it, but they're not preparing the American people, they're preparing to control the American people.
[02:12:50.779 --> 02:12:52.140]  Big difference.
[02:12:52.140 --> 02:13:05.351]  And then the people in many respects will beg for order, just like they are in the triggered events in Egypt, and then that will set the precedent for even more control and the checkpoints run by the TSA on the streets of America, and that's all announced.
[02:13:05.351 --> 02:13:15.940]  Two years ago in Tennessee, it's in my new film, Police State 4, Rise of FEMA, the governor said stop running Homeland Security, multi-jurisdictional, Army, Marines, FBI, shutting down highways.
[02:13:16.480 --> 02:13:16.900]  I don't think so.
[02:13:39.875 --> 02:13:40.055]  I think?
[02:14:09.915 --> 02:14:13.777]  And now TSA is at the Superbowl running the hands down the pants.
[02:14:13.777 --> 02:14:17.218]  Now the telescreens, now they're running x-ray checkpoints in the middle of the country.
[02:14:17.218 --> 02:14:19.739]  This is the beta test acclimation rollout.
[02:14:19.739 --> 02:14:37.086]  And I just said earlier, if we have, or when we have an economic collapse, if we are not prepared as a people in our local communities, and we're not strong and able to stand up on our own, then people will be desperate and more likely to go along with martial law, and the military and police will also be more likely to go along with it, because in their eyes it'll be a real emergency.
[02:14:37.086 --> 02:14:38.787]  That's why we have to, as a people,
[02:14:39.247 --> 02:14:41.629]  And this is the whole focus of our new initiative.
[02:14:41.629 --> 02:14:48.855]  Preemptively warn people so they know it's coming so we have credibility and get patriots as a remnant in position to rebuild the country.
[02:14:48.855 --> 02:14:50.276]  We'll get them ready ahead of time.
[02:14:50.276 --> 02:14:57.242]  We should be restoring the institutions we've allowed to let atrophy, chief among them being the militia of the people, our sheriff's posse's.
[02:14:57.242 --> 02:15:02.947]  And the ADL's upset because several states are moving to reignite and establish the state militia.
[02:15:03.487 --> 02:15:03.827]  That's right.
[02:15:03.827 --> 02:15:04.748]  They don't want to see this happen.
[02:15:04.748 --> 02:15:11.972]  Even in Montana right now, a simple Home Guard bill has been opposed by the state version of the SPLC in Montana.
[02:15:11.972 --> 02:15:14.413]  They're saying the state can't even be trusted to have its own people.
[02:15:14.413 --> 02:15:14.653]  Right.
[02:15:14.653 --> 02:15:16.394]  They call it a paramilitary organization.
[02:15:16.394 --> 02:15:18.275]  They don't want the state to have any kind of power.
[02:15:18.275 --> 02:15:21.117]  Their military power is supposed to be with us, the people.
[02:15:21.417 --> 02:15:24.740]  That was the answer to the ancient question of who should guard the guardians.
[02:15:24.740 --> 02:15:27.262]  The founders intended us to be our own guardians.
[02:15:27.262 --> 02:15:28.203]  We are the sovereigns!
[02:15:28.203 --> 02:15:28.763]  That's right.
[02:15:28.763 --> 02:15:30.465]  And we are safe.
[02:15:30.465 --> 02:15:31.766]  We can't oppress ourselves.
[02:15:31.766 --> 02:15:33.607]  They can't make us oppress ourselves.
[02:15:33.607 --> 02:15:43.736]  So that's why they want to gut the states, and they have, and weaken the people so that we are desperate and destitute when an emergency happens and they can bring in standing army troops and even potentially foreign troops.
[02:15:43.996 --> 02:15:51.138]  Alright, tell us about your new initiative to counter this and the intelligence you're getting from all of your members and others around the world, Stuart.
[02:15:51.138 --> 02:15:57.419]  Well, the main focus is to wake the veterans up to their responsibility under their oath that it's not enough just to vote.
[02:15:57.419 --> 02:16:00.219]  It's not enough to say to the current serving, don't violate our rights.
[02:16:00.219 --> 02:16:04.580]  The veterans have to go out there and re-establish institutions we have let atrophy.
[02:16:04.580 --> 02:16:06.141]  We have to fill the vacuum.
[02:16:06.141 --> 02:16:12.562]  We have to occupy as the rightful occupiers of our country instead of these foreign bankers with this federal gaggle occupying us.
[02:16:12.722 --> 02:16:12.982]  That's right.
[02:16:33.208 --> 02:16:35.949]  The rest of the world already is anyway, so we should do.
[02:16:35.949 --> 02:16:41.751]  Decouple from the fiat system, unplug from the matrix, and rebuild sovereign communities at the local level.
[02:16:41.751 --> 02:16:49.934]  So warm up the states for the confrontation with the illegitimate federal government so we can hopefully peacefully operate through the 10th Amendment powers.
[02:16:50.314 --> 02:17:01.464]  Disconnect, because if we just sit here under the fiat system, and when it collapses on our heads, we can't think we're going to be able to climb out of the rubble and rebuild, because they have another super system, as Max said, a world fed, is what they have planned next.
[02:17:01.464 --> 02:17:13.254]  We've got to get from under the fiat system, get back to the foundation of a free republic the founders left us, that we've allowed to... And we're not the revolutionaries, we're the restorationists, the globalists and the revolutionaries.
[02:17:13.254 --> 02:17:14.695]  We want to restore the republic.
[02:17:14.875 --> 02:17:15.215]  Exactly.
[02:17:15.215 --> 02:17:27.082]  And the way to do it is get out from underneath the false system and get back to what the founders gave us, which is county, sovereign counties and sovereign states and resilient communities economically, militarily, with your communications.
[02:17:27.082 --> 02:17:28.683]  Make sure you have alternate communications.
[02:17:28.683 --> 02:17:32.665]  When they pull the plug on the internet here, as we saw in Egypt, that we won't care.
[02:17:32.665 --> 02:17:35.486]  What did FEMA do in Katrina and the police had to guard it?
[02:17:35.486 --> 02:17:37.768]  They went in and hacked down their communications.
[02:17:37.768 --> 02:17:39.409]  People said, well, the cops aren't on duty.
[02:17:39.409 --> 02:17:43.491]  FEMA had cut all their lines to then do a beta test of a takeover.
[02:17:43.951 --> 02:17:48.872]  Right, and so the sheriff there posted armed guards to stop him from doing it again and reconnected the lines.
[02:17:48.872 --> 02:17:49.292]  So that's right.
[02:17:49.292 --> 02:17:57.835]  So we have to as a community, in all local communities, and this is both in the public sphere and the private sphere, work to get your county to establish a real county militia.
[02:17:57.835 --> 02:17:59.375]  But don't wait for that to happen.
[02:17:59.375 --> 02:18:06.597]  While you're doing that, also, go start a neighborhood watch and make sure that you have mutual aid and support among private citizens as well.
[02:18:06.597 --> 02:18:07.517]  It's a two-pillar approach.
[02:18:07.557 --> 02:18:11.659]  Yeah, they're trying to roll out their federal neighborhood watch to see something, say something.
[02:18:11.659 --> 02:18:17.221]  So what you're saying is actually join those, but join local ones so our people fill those spots.
[02:18:17.221 --> 02:18:20.803]  Star Neighborhood Watch, you and your neighbors, make sure that you... A totally private one.
[02:18:20.803 --> 02:18:21.163]  Exactly.
[02:18:21.163 --> 02:18:22.964]  Should people join to see something, say something?
[02:18:22.964 --> 02:18:25.145]  No, I don't think so.
[02:18:25.145 --> 02:18:26.046]  State level only.
[02:18:26.046 --> 02:18:27.286]  Forget about the feds.
[02:18:27.286 --> 02:18:29.347]  You do what you're supposed to do in your county.
[02:18:29.347 --> 02:18:31.268]  But it would be valuable to have some of our people in there.
[02:18:31.828 --> 02:18:32.829]  Yeah, I suppose so.
[02:18:32.829 --> 02:18:36.530]  But the main focus is in your own neighborhoods and your own state.
[02:18:36.530 --> 02:18:38.091]  So I would focus there.
[02:18:38.091 --> 02:18:42.352]  We're going to break and I want you to have the floor and go through all those lists and give out the website and a lot more.
[02:18:42.352 --> 02:18:44.233]  It's so exciting to have you here in studio.
[02:18:44.233 --> 02:18:49.955]  But briefly, last time you were here you said that the awakening of police and military is exponential.
[02:18:49.955 --> 02:18:51.096]  What's your report briefly on that?
[02:18:51.616 --> 02:18:53.338]  Well, they're worried about it.
[02:18:53.338 --> 02:18:56.683]  I mean, Tunisia is a wonderful example of the right way to do it.
[02:18:56.683 --> 02:18:58.585]  The military did not pull a coup.
[02:18:58.585 --> 02:19:00.348]  The military did not shoot the people.
[02:19:00.348 --> 02:19:01.830]  They simply stood down.
[02:19:01.830 --> 02:19:03.512]  It's a wonderful example.
[02:19:03.512 --> 02:19:06.196]  And I think that meme, that example, is going to spread.
[02:19:08.570 --> 02:19:14.215]  So the answer is, follow the Constitution and Bill of Rights and they'll never have to even think about it.
[02:19:14.215 --> 02:19:15.916]  I mean, if they follow that, that's it.
[02:19:15.916 --> 02:19:16.857]  They can't do it.
[02:19:16.857 --> 02:19:17.698]  Yeah, it's game over for that.
[02:19:17.698 --> 02:19:19.279]  They can't do it without them.
[02:19:19.279 --> 02:19:22.182]  But we can't just sit and wait for them to do the right thing.
[02:19:22.182 --> 02:19:27.246]  We also have to make sure that we are resilient so when the collapse comes, we're not desperate.
[02:19:27.246 --> 02:19:32.410]  Because otherwise, we'll take the FEMA card, the new currency will probably come in the form of a FEMA card.
[02:19:32.410 --> 02:19:33.051]  Here's your new debit card.
[02:19:33.051 --> 02:19:33.471]  Digital, yeah.
[02:19:34.592 --> 02:19:37.014]  We can't be dependent upon that.
[02:19:37.014 --> 02:19:43.920]  We must disconnect and rebuild sound money systems, food independence, and economic independence as well.
[02:19:43.920 --> 02:19:44.360]  We're going to break.
[02:19:44.360 --> 02:19:48.423]  We're going to come back and go through this new huge initiative you guys are launching.
[02:19:48.423 --> 02:19:52.687]  And it's up to you out there to get the ball and start carrying it on this.
[02:19:52.687 --> 02:19:53.888]  Resistance is victory.
[02:19:53.888 --> 02:19:57.431]  If you take action, we have the truth on our side.
[02:19:57.431 --> 02:19:58.732]  You are unstoppable.
[02:19:58.732 --> 02:19:59.532]  But it's up to you.
[02:19:59.532 --> 02:20:00.033]  Look in the mirror.
[02:20:01.288 --> 02:20:05.852]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:05.852 --> 02:20:06.772]  Number 1.
[02:20:06.772 --> 02:20:10.195]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:10.195 --> 02:20:11.056]  Number 2.
[02:20:11.056 --> 02:20:15.939]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:20:15.939 --> 02:20:16.700]  It's true.
[02:20:16.700 --> 02:20:21.564]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:20:21.564 --> 02:20:22.384]  Number 3.
[02:20:22.384 --> 02:20:25.967]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:20:25.967 --> 02:20:29.650]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:20:29.870 --> 02:20:30.671]  Number 4.
[02:20:30.671 --> 02:20:33.433]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:33.433 --> 02:20:37.115]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:20:37.115 --> 02:20:37.896]  Number 5.
[02:20:37.896 --> 02:20:42.059]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:20:42.059 --> 02:20:46.802]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[02:20:53.048 --> 02:20:55.291]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun.

[02:20:57.593 --> 02:20:58.294]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:20:58.294 --> 02:21:01.497]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:21:09.265 --> 02:21:11.827]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:21:11.827 --> 02:21:17.252]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:21:17.252 --> 02:21:20.195]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:21:20.195 --> 02:21:22.517]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:21:22.517 --> 02:21:28.802]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:21:28.802 --> 02:21:32.005]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:21:32.185 --> 02:21:39.652]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.

[02:23:00.160 --> 02:23:02.441]  What bothers you most about menopause?
[02:23:02.441 --> 02:23:03.782]  Is it the hot flashes?
[02:23:03.782 --> 02:23:05.803]  Waking up at night drenched in sweat?
[02:23:05.803 --> 02:23:08.244]  How about the mood swings or putting on weight?

[02:24:01.577 --> 02:24:07.702]  Okay, Stuart, this is a short segment.
[02:24:07.702 --> 02:24:11.364]  Get into this new initiative you're launching at the Oath Keepers website.
[02:24:11.364 --> 02:24:21.272]  Then we're going to get into what you were telling me during the break about this really Ron Paul-type constitutional rebellion at the state level through the legislatures.
[02:24:21.272 --> 02:24:23.894]  People are really starting to get it, so exciting things happening.
[02:24:23.894 --> 02:24:25.315]  But break down your new initiative.
[02:24:25.615 --> 02:24:30.197]  Well, the whole focus here is to do for the veterans what we did for the current serving.
[02:24:30.197 --> 02:24:33.739]  To get them to understand their personal obligation to rebuild the Republic.
[02:24:33.739 --> 02:24:38.181]  Under their oath, they can't just vote, they can't just sit on the couch and say, I hope no one violates my rights.
[02:24:38.181 --> 02:24:40.202]  They gotta get out there and resurrect.
[02:24:40.202 --> 02:24:43.163]  And frankly, it's our own fault we're in the position we're in now.
[02:24:43.163 --> 02:24:47.205]  I told one veterans gathering, I said, look, you should get down on your knees and beg forgiveness.
[02:24:47.705 --> 02:24:49.066]  For your neglect and negligence.
[02:24:49.066 --> 02:24:53.288]  So we're going to wake them up, get them off the barstool, so they don't have to sit around drinking beers.
[02:24:53.288 --> 02:24:57.310]  We're going to reactivate them, make them realize they still have a mission.
[02:24:57.310 --> 02:24:59.232]  Under their oath, they must rebuild the Republic.
[02:24:59.232 --> 02:25:05.335]  So we're going to be focusing on the alternate market movement, focusing on revitalizing the public militia at the county level.
[02:25:05.335 --> 02:25:07.396]  I'm talking about a real public institution.
[02:25:07.396 --> 02:25:11.919]  Like you have a volunteer fire department that's established by the county, but staffed by volunteers.
[02:25:11.919 --> 02:25:12.999]  Same thing here.
[02:25:12.999 --> 02:25:14.640]  And also at the state level as well.
[02:25:14.640 --> 02:25:15.801]  And forming sheriff's posses.
[02:25:16.021 --> 02:25:23.226]  And I want to go to every VFW hall and American Legion hall and Marine Corps League hall and say, look, you guys get your own grain reserves.
[02:25:23.226 --> 02:25:27.388]  Used to be in this country we had three years of grain reserves for the people during the Cold War.
[02:25:27.388 --> 02:25:30.490]  Now we have enough to give all of us one half of a loaf of bread.
[02:25:30.490 --> 02:25:30.791]  That's it.
[02:25:31.351 --> 02:25:33.572]  And so we have to build up our own grain reserves.
[02:25:33.572 --> 02:25:37.775]  All these veterans organizations, they should be inside their own organizations getting food storage.
[02:25:37.775 --> 02:25:42.077]  Globalism has worked hard to make sure we're dependent on them for a long time.
[02:25:42.077 --> 02:25:42.758]  Exactly.
[02:25:42.758 --> 02:25:43.939]  So we've got to rebuild it.
[02:25:43.939 --> 02:25:45.980]  It's like a pyramid like this.
[02:25:45.980 --> 02:25:47.581]  The power is supposed to be at the very bottom.
[02:25:48.001 --> 02:25:52.843]  The strength and power is supposed to be at the bottom of the Republic, and only at the top is very little bit of power.
[02:25:52.843 --> 02:25:53.783]  They've turned it on its head.
[02:25:53.783 --> 02:25:59.485]  They have very weak states now, and weak people, and a powerful top-down system over the top of us.
[02:25:59.485 --> 02:26:01.426]  We've got to reverse that, flip it back over again.
[02:26:02.642 --> 02:26:06.364]  Continuing with this initiative, and give folks the website.
[02:26:06.364 --> 02:26:11.187]  Oathkeepers.org, and we're going to be calling this Operation Reactivate.
[02:26:11.187 --> 02:26:12.307]  So that's going to be the name of it.
[02:26:12.307 --> 02:26:15.509]  Actually, Rob Dew, your producer, that was his idea.
[02:26:15.509 --> 02:26:16.690]  So I want to thank Rob for that.
[02:26:16.690 --> 02:26:17.230]  Wow.
[02:26:17.230 --> 02:26:17.830]  It's great.
[02:26:17.830 --> 02:26:22.513]  So we're reactivating them in their oath, realizing that, look, you know, my service is not done.
[02:26:22.513 --> 02:26:26.775]  I have to get off the barstool, get off the couch, and get back out there and do it.
[02:26:26.775 --> 02:26:31.498]  And if we can wake the veterans up, they will lead the rest of the people in this country to do what's right.
[02:26:31.738 --> 02:26:47.039]  Well I'll tell you, the really big jump we've got on the controllers is that Ron Paul 35 years ago, myself 16, 17 years ago, countless other people, G. Edward Griffin, the list goes on and on, knew history, knew who the globalists were, read their own reports that were public,
[02:26:47.660 --> 02:26:51.342]  Understood what was happening, warned people, got laughed at for a long time.
[02:26:51.342 --> 02:26:58.047]  Now we're not getting laughed at to the point of, this stuff's so mainstream, Glenn Beck's, there's a world government, they're coming for everything.
[02:26:58.047 --> 02:27:10.455]  You know, he's telling the truth on more and more because we're dragging Fox News over to at least have to act like true patriots to even stay relevant and they have more viewers and all the other cable stations combined because they'll at least
[02:27:11.255 --> 02:27:15.640]  To carry on a little bit of our political coloration.
[02:27:15.640 --> 02:27:18.424]  Well, as Max Keiser said earlier, it's out in the open now.
[02:27:18.424 --> 02:27:21.848]  Special drawing rights are going to be the new basis for the new world currency.
[02:27:21.848 --> 02:27:22.989]  They're telling us what they're going to do.
[02:27:22.989 --> 02:27:24.471]  It's not conspiracy theory anymore.
[02:27:24.471 --> 02:27:26.173]  But we got the jump on them by warning people.
[02:27:26.173 --> 02:27:26.794]  Oh, absolutely.
[02:27:27.074 --> 02:27:30.537]  And a total takeover of one state by the people will then be used as a model for the rest.
[02:27:56.235 --> 02:27:56.695]  That's right.
[02:27:56.695 --> 02:27:59.177]  One domino falls, victory is ours!
[02:27:59.177 --> 02:28:00.837]  Amen to that, exactly.
[02:28:00.837 --> 02:28:11.743]  So, you know, if one state can do it and show how it's done, you get one state to reinstitute a state bank and do sound money, like Virginia's starting to do, and Montana's... And openly confront the globalists verbally.
[02:28:11.743 --> 02:28:12.744]  Exactly, right.
[02:28:12.744 --> 02:28:14.365]  Call them out.
[02:28:14.365 --> 02:28:21.328]  So if they can do that, and once we start doing that, people realize that, hey, the sky's not going to fall when I stand up and just act like a citizen again.
[02:28:21.328 --> 02:28:22.549]  A sovereign citizen.
[02:28:22.549 --> 02:28:24.170]  The sky's going to fall if we don't.
[02:28:25.302 --> 02:28:25.783]  Absolutely.
[02:28:25.783 --> 02:28:26.763]  It's going to crumble.
[02:28:26.763 --> 02:28:30.086]  We should accept the fact that the dollar is going to die.
[02:28:30.086 --> 02:28:31.287]  It's going to collapse.
[02:28:31.287 --> 02:28:43.338]  The question is, are we going to sit there and let it collapse on top of us, or are we going to rebuild what we're supposed to have so that when it collapses, we can assert our own future rather than having it imposed, having their model imposed on us?
[02:28:43.338 --> 02:28:44.619]  And that idea is wholesome.
[02:28:44.619 --> 02:28:46.160]  It's the spirit of 1776.
[02:28:46.160 --> 02:28:50.704]  If we put our idea out against global bondage, we're going to win.
[02:28:51.525 --> 02:28:52.025]  That's right.
[02:28:52.025 --> 02:28:53.486]  So they don't want us to do anything.
[02:28:53.486 --> 02:28:56.348]  That's why I tell you, just go vote and otherwise leave it to us.
[02:28:56.348 --> 02:28:58.549]  So you want to do what they don't want you to do.
[02:28:58.549 --> 02:29:05.553]  So then probably the Law Center and the rest of the propaganda machine does not want you to start a sheriff's posse or to revitalize a militia of your county.
[02:29:05.553 --> 02:29:06.654]  So you should go do that.
[02:29:06.654 --> 02:29:08.915]  Whatever they don't want you to do, that's what you should be doing.
[02:29:09.335 --> 02:29:10.475]  Well, that's what I've always said.
[02:29:10.475 --> 02:29:12.716]  Anything the globalists are for, I'm against.
[02:29:12.716 --> 02:29:17.798]  And then if you analyze each point intellectually, whatever they want is not in our interest.
[02:29:17.798 --> 02:29:18.118]  That's right.
[02:29:18.118 --> 02:29:19.299]  It's the bizarre republic.
[02:29:19.299 --> 02:29:21.880]  They're trying to impose the bizarre republic on us.
[02:29:21.880 --> 02:29:23.460]  Destroy our national sovereignty.
[02:29:23.460 --> 02:29:24.861]  Destroy our state sovereignty.
[02:29:24.861 --> 02:29:29.743]  And then we have Obama continuing the SPP that Bush started and trying to merge...
[02:29:30.683 --> 02:29:32.804]  That's been out for a few days and I should have covered it.
[02:29:32.804 --> 02:29:34.064]  We knew it was already going on by stealth.
[02:29:34.064 --> 02:29:35.544]  We'll cover that when we come back.
[02:29:35.544 --> 02:29:40.466]  Also, the other incredible information you're getting from all your sources all around the country and the world.
[02:29:40.466 --> 02:29:42.786]  Stuart Rhodes is our guest in studio.
[02:29:42.786 --> 02:29:43.527]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:29:43.527 --> 02:29:46.828]  Our websites are InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:29:46.828 --> 02:29:51.569]  You are the resistance.
[02:29:51.569 --> 02:29:52.969]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.969 --> 02:29:55.490]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.490 --> 02:29:58.151]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:02.512 --> 02:30:06.533]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[02:30:06.533 --> 02:30:09.774]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[02:30:09.774 --> 02:30:14.555]  As we're finishing off this agenda, that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[02:30:14.555 --> 02:30:20.956]  We have tremendous influence on our President and Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[02:30:20.956 --> 02:30:23.197]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us
[02:30:23.737 --> 02:30:25.218]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists!
[02:30:25.218 --> 02:30:26.499]  They're asking for more matches!
[02:30:26.499 --> 02:30:28.760]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[02:30:42.648 --> 02:30:49.918]  Today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[02:30:49.918 --> 02:30:59.050]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at InfoWars.com or watch it online right now in super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv
[02:31:01.052 --> 02:31:05.595]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:31:05.595 --> 02:31:06.516]  Number 1.
[02:31:06.516 --> 02:31:09.938]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:31:09.938 --> 02:31:10.799]  Number 2.
[02:31:10.799 --> 02:31:15.702]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:31:15.702 --> 02:31:16.442]  It's true.
[02:31:16.442 --> 02:31:21.306]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:31:21.306 --> 02:31:22.126]  Number 3.
[02:31:22.126 --> 02:31:25.728]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:31:25.728 --> 02:31:29.431]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:31:29.631 --> 02:31:30.411]  Number 4.
[02:31:30.411 --> 02:31:33.172]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:31:33.172 --> 02:31:36.853]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:31:36.853 --> 02:31:37.653]  Number 5.
[02:31:37.653 --> 02:31:41.794]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:31:41.794 --> 02:31:46.856]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:31:46.856 --> 02:31:51.017]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:51.017 --> 02:31:52.798]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:31:52.798 --> 02:31:57.399]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:32:00.862 --> 02:32:02.023]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:32:02.023 --> 02:32:08.948]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:32:08.948 --> 02:32:11.510]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:32:11.510 --> 02:32:16.895]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:32:16.895 --> 02:32:19.937]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:32:19.937 --> 02:32:21.999]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:32:22.239 --> 02:32:28.484]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:32:28.484 --> 02:32:31.867]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:32:31.867 --> 02:32:37.652]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:32:37.652 --> 02:32:39.293]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:32:39.293 --> 02:32:40.594]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:32:40.594 --> 02:32:43.257]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:32:43.257 --> 02:32:44.678]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:32:44.938 --> 02:32:47.480]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:32:47.480 --> 02:32:52.105]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:32:52.105 --> 02:32:54.687]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[02:32:54.687 --> 02:32:58.550]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:32:58.550 --> 02:32:59.531]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:33:09.440 --> 02:33:13.948]  Leading a frontal assault on the lies of the New World Order.
[02:33:13.948 --> 02:33:17.735]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:33:29.738 --> 02:33:32.622]  We were just talking about something really important during the break.
[02:33:32.622 --> 02:33:35.786]  Stuart was saying, what's your real view on Egypt?
[02:33:35.786 --> 02:33:46.180]  And I said, well, it's like a tree that's leaning over somebody's house and they need to cut it so they choose the time before the next big storm comes and they go ahead and chop it down in a controlled burn, basically.
[02:33:46.881 --> 02:33:47.281]  I don't
[02:34:02.711 --> 02:34:06.534]  He is a globalist, but he didn't want to have World War III with Iran.
[02:34:06.534 --> 02:34:15.159]  And so now they're pulling this destabilization, but Glenn Beck's saying it's socialist Muslims doing it, and that it's all George Soros, and that's one arm.
[02:34:15.159 --> 02:34:20.443]  But no, it's the globalists that run our country that are triggering this order-out-of-chaos destabilization.
[02:34:20.443 --> 02:34:23.865]  And I was saying, that's why we need to point out we're restorationists.
[02:34:23.865 --> 02:34:26.207]  We want to follow the law, Bill of Rights, Constitution.
[02:34:26.807 --> 02:34:37.356]  The revolution is globalism, and NAFTA, and GATT, and the North American Union through SPP, and the new continental security perimeter that they've now officially put into place.
[02:34:37.356 --> 02:34:42.560]  We're the ones that want to stop the chaos, and the problem is the globalists know they're going to push us into chaos.
[02:34:42.560 --> 02:34:45.462]  They're going to try to steer it, maybe for a right-wing coup.
[02:34:45.462 --> 02:34:46.523]  You don't know.
[02:34:46.523 --> 02:34:48.144]  But Stewart said, absolutely.
[02:34:48.144 --> 02:34:49.625]  Have you heard of Operation Clean Sweep?
[02:34:49.625 --> 02:34:50.286]  Tell folks about that.
[02:34:50.546 --> 02:34:57.829]  Well, unfortunately, some people, they could be well-intended patriots, are calling for, essentially, a military coup.
[02:34:57.829 --> 02:35:02.751]  And that's as dangerous as any usurping president trying to be El Presidente for life.
[02:35:02.751 --> 02:35:05.313]  A military coup is going from the frying pan to the fire.
[02:35:05.313 --> 02:35:09.054]  You still wind up with a destruction of the Constitution, a destruction of the Republic.
[02:35:09.054 --> 02:35:13.876]  And the problem that they're doing is they're looking at Washington, D.C., and they're ignoring the states.
[02:35:13.876 --> 02:35:15.177]  The answer is in the states.
[02:35:15.177 --> 02:35:17.158]  The answer is we, the people, take care of things.
[02:35:17.278 --> 02:35:25.023]  Peacefully, the states stand up and have the moral courage and start exposing them, then the globalists will literally evaporate.
[02:35:25.023 --> 02:35:37.152]  Well, if you give the people a false choice between submit to tyranny or turn to the generals to come in and do a military coup, that's been the bane of republics throughout history since ancient Rome.
[02:35:37.152 --> 02:35:38.013]  They've gone back and forth.
[02:35:38.013 --> 02:35:39.093]  Look at third world countries.
[02:35:39.093 --> 02:35:39.894]  It's happening every month.
[02:35:40.274 --> 02:35:40.895]  Absolutely.
[02:35:40.895 --> 02:35:53.525]  And so the founder's genius is that if we just simply follow the oath and the military stands down and then the people in the states stand up and take care of it, it's solved without having to resort to those two extremes.
[02:35:53.525 --> 02:35:56.708]  Yeah, we want to go back to the Constitution, not to something new and even worse.
[02:35:57.230 --> 02:35:58.951]  Well, or old and even worse.
[02:35:58.951 --> 02:36:00.732]  You know, a Caesar crossing the Rubicon.
[02:36:00.732 --> 02:36:01.912]  This is the same kind of thing.
[02:36:01.912 --> 02:36:09.416]  You look to the generals to save you, and now you have a general in sunglasses doing his MacArthur imitation, ruining your life, instead of an Erskine president.
[02:36:09.416 --> 02:36:09.997]  Is it any better?
[02:36:09.997 --> 02:36:10.917]  No, it's the same thing.
[02:36:10.917 --> 02:36:12.438]  Generally, it's worse.
[02:36:12.438 --> 02:36:12.978]  Generally, it is.
[02:36:12.978 --> 02:36:16.260]  You went with a Pinochet or a Franco, some bloody dictator.
[02:36:16.920 --> 02:36:19.242]  So, we have to get back to the Constitution.
[02:36:19.242 --> 02:36:24.146]  A lot of these folks, I get messages all the time, saying, well, you say you're not going to do something, what are you going to do?
[02:36:24.146 --> 02:36:25.927]  When's the military going to march on Washington, D.C.?
[02:36:25.927 --> 02:36:28.249]  And I say, it's not their job, it's your job.
[02:36:28.249 --> 02:36:28.790]  That's right.
[02:36:28.790 --> 02:36:35.175]  Well, I love these people that, you know, these keyboard commandos that send me emails and say, you're not calling for violence, you're a wimp.
[02:36:35.175 --> 02:36:37.436]  A, we found out most of the time those are provocateur feds.
[02:36:38.657 --> 02:36:40.617]  But B, look in the mirror.
[02:36:40.617 --> 02:36:42.038]  I've done as much as I can.
[02:36:42.038 --> 02:36:43.518]  Look at what we've been able to do.
[02:36:43.518 --> 02:36:44.138]  What about you?
[02:36:44.138 --> 02:36:48.019]  Don't always look for somebody else who's already standing up to do it for you.
[02:36:48.019 --> 02:36:49.479]  You want the solution, look in the mirror.
[02:36:49.479 --> 02:36:51.939]  And look, here's a beta test example.
[02:36:51.939 --> 02:36:53.540]  I've been beating the drum for several years.
[02:36:53.540 --> 02:36:59.441]  Go to your city council, point out, read what's in sodium fluoride, the other ingredients, the bone cancer evidence, the admissions.
[02:36:59.441 --> 02:37:01.441]  Now they're starting to take it out all over the place.
[02:37:01.441 --> 02:37:02.421]  Suddenly it's collapsing.
[02:37:02.421 --> 02:37:05.522]  The government came out a month ago and said, okay, we do want to take it out of the water.
[02:37:05.522 --> 02:37:07.162]  We do want to stop using it as a pesticide.
[02:37:08.931 --> 02:37:14.154]  You have record numbers of folks not taking the flu vaccine because we had a revolution of just reading the insert.
[02:37:14.154 --> 02:37:16.116]  It's all about you making daily choices.
[02:37:16.116 --> 02:37:23.440]  There's not going to be some Arnold Schwarzenegger on a white horse riding in and sending Obama to the gulag and everything's fixed.
[02:37:23.440 --> 02:37:24.661]  Obama's a front man.
[02:37:24.661 --> 02:37:31.426]  This is a process of rediscovering the spirit of 1776, the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, the Declaration of Independence.
[02:37:31.426 --> 02:37:37.910]  That is our rightful property and it's the rightful document that
[02:37:38.450 --> 02:37:41.771]  Basically states what's already inherently there.
[02:37:41.771 --> 02:37:42.911]  Exactly.
[02:37:42.911 --> 02:37:44.852]  And here's the point I make to people all the time.
[02:37:44.852 --> 02:37:49.913]  I say, look, what institution is supposed to take care of domestic security?
[02:37:49.913 --> 02:37:51.254]  Not the standing army.
[02:37:51.254 --> 02:37:52.414]  It's the militia.
[02:37:52.414 --> 02:37:56.215]  Repel invasions, suppress insurrections, and execute the laws of the Union.
[02:37:56.215 --> 02:38:01.757]  So if anyone's going to go and correct things, it's going to be the people themselves as the militia.
[02:38:01.817 --> 02:38:12.948]  Well, Kennesaw, Georgia had one of the highest crime rates in Georgia, a bedroom community of Atlanta, until in 89 they said everyone must own guns by law, just like Switzerland has, and it has the lowest crime rate in the country within one year.
[02:38:12.948 --> 02:38:14.309]  I mean, it's simple.
[02:38:14.309 --> 02:38:20.996]  You don't have a lot of home invasions in Texas because they don't break in like they do in New York here while you're there because they know they'll get killed.
[02:38:20.996 --> 02:38:21.717]  It's real simple.
[02:38:21.717 --> 02:38:22.478]  Guns are the answer.
[02:38:23.058 --> 02:38:25.320]  Well, also, another way to look at this is this way.
[02:38:25.320 --> 02:38:29.443]  People always say, well, the militia is there as a final check on tyrannical government.
[02:38:29.443 --> 02:38:31.224]  They're missing an important point.
[02:38:31.224 --> 02:38:38.229]  The militia is first supposed to be to fill that vacuum, so you're not relying on standing army troops and professional police.
[02:38:38.229 --> 02:38:39.670]  You're relying on you and your neighbors.
[02:38:40.911 --> 02:38:44.775]  No longer have a situation where you need outside help, you're independent.
[02:38:44.775 --> 02:38:47.317]  And that prevents them from having to pretest in the first place.
[02:38:47.317 --> 02:38:59.809]  We've had cities of hundreds of thousands of people up before 1900, even millions, where the only police were there to respond to court orders to go out, you know, once people have been found to commit crime and pick them up and take them into the court.
[02:38:59.809 --> 02:39:02.392]  The constables, the sheriffs, deputies, and people.
[02:39:02.392 --> 02:39:03.473]  And now we've got cops.
[02:39:03.473 --> 02:39:04.394]  I saw an article today
[02:39:04.674 --> 02:39:12.999]  Where a guy's little Jack Russell Terrier got out, killed a raccoon in the backyard in a fight, and raccoons are mean, and now they're charging him with animal cruelty.
[02:39:12.999 --> 02:39:20.064]  Any way to put charges on law-abiding citizens, that's another telltale sign of tyranny, is when they criminalize everything.
[02:39:20.788 --> 02:39:22.569]  And also nationalize the police.
[02:39:22.569 --> 02:39:24.329]  So those two twin things are happening.
[02:39:24.329 --> 02:39:33.133]  You've got, like you said, you've got a massive pile of laws, and they don't tell the jury about the real power to judge even in the face of the law, and he quit.
[02:39:33.133 --> 02:39:39.876]  I just got done with a hearing yesterday in front of the Montana House about a jury notification bill, or a fully formed jury bill, in Montana.
[02:39:39.876 --> 02:39:46.599]  A very important part of our core responsibilities as citizens, a last check on abuse, is really the jury.
[02:39:46.599 --> 02:39:48.059]  They judge the law as well as the facts.
[02:39:48.059 --> 02:39:49.100]  They can do whatever they want.
[02:39:49.100 --> 02:39:49.760]  They're the judges.
[02:39:50.140 --> 02:39:51.901]  That's historic reality in fact.
[02:39:51.901 --> 02:39:54.823]  But the problem is, is they're not even telling them about this.
[02:39:54.823 --> 02:39:57.564]  And yesterday it was really... That's another veto on law.
[02:39:57.564 --> 02:39:59.125]  It doesn't even matter if it's the law.
[02:39:59.125 --> 02:40:02.627]  The jury doesn't like it and thinks it's wrong what's being done or it's not being applied right?
[02:40:02.627 --> 02:40:03.428]  Nope!
[02:40:03.428 --> 02:40:03.908]  That's right.
[02:40:03.908 --> 02:40:12.192]  And there's a famous case in the colonial era of a publisher named Zangler who was prosecuted for criticizing the governor of New York.
[02:40:12.192 --> 02:40:14.894]  And he admitted he had written an article critical of the governor.
[02:40:15.194 --> 02:40:19.957]  And under libel laws back then, even though it was truthful, it was still considered libel.
[02:40:19.957 --> 02:40:26.580]  And when the jury refused to convict him, even in the face of the obvious, you know, he was guilty, they still refused to convict him.
[02:40:26.580 --> 02:40:32.323]  And that's the start of our First Amendment right to free press and free speech, protections in the First Amendment.
[02:40:32.323 --> 02:40:34.565]  Got their start in a jury nullification case.
[02:40:34.565 --> 02:40:40.248]  So it's one more example of a core institution we've allowed to wither away, and the government has co-opted it.
[02:40:40.968 --> 02:40:41.268]  I don't know.
[02:41:03.522 --> 02:41:06.683]  We've got to set up the continental security perimeter.
[02:41:06.683 --> 02:41:09.765]  It can't even be the Feds that respond, much less the locals.
[02:41:09.765 --> 02:41:23.070]  Now, from Mexico to Alaska, it's going to be this international body, and we're going to fund this international body, this American Union, through highway taxes, through the trans-Texas Napa superhighways.
[02:41:23.810 --> 02:41:32.876]  And here's WorldNetDaily, Obama's signature creates continental perimeter and it goes on, move described as key step in advance of North American Union.
[02:41:32.876 --> 02:41:43.863]  I remember, and it's in my film, Endgame, Bush signing an agreement with Merkel and the EU and Barroso on the Rose Garden saying, we're now merging the North American Union with the EU.
[02:41:45.003 --> 02:41:48.427]  In 2007, and no one even paid attention when it was on TV.
[02:41:48.427 --> 02:41:56.314]  This is just like they celebrated in 2007, the 50th anniversary of the EU, but they told people in Europe it started in 2000.
[02:41:56.314 --> 02:41:58.437]  They had signed the Treaty of Rome in 57.
[02:41:58.437 --> 02:41:59.478]  It was already in place then.
[02:42:00.325 --> 02:42:05.007]  And they called you a conspiracy theorist for pointing this out, and now it's becoming much more out in the open.
[02:42:05.007 --> 02:42:09.608]  And what happened to the EU, and how that came about, is exactly what's happening to us right now.
[02:42:09.608 --> 02:42:11.549]  They start with a free trade area.
[02:42:11.549 --> 02:42:12.690]  Integration by stealth.
[02:42:12.690 --> 02:42:13.990]  Right, absolutely.
[02:42:13.990 --> 02:42:15.110]  Incrementalism, too.
[02:42:15.110 --> 02:42:18.752]  Free trade, and then it goes to a common currency, and then it goes to a common government.
[02:42:19.232 --> 02:42:20.373]  And then you lose your sovereignty.
[02:42:20.373 --> 02:42:26.798]  So now they're overturning laws that have been around in England for hundreds of years and now found to be illegal.
[02:42:26.798 --> 02:42:32.181]  They're getting rid of their common law and they're saying we're going to have to get rid of some of our laws and adopt Canadian and Mexican law.
[02:42:32.181 --> 02:42:35.184]  Is that what they're saying?
[02:42:35.184 --> 02:42:35.424]  Yeah.
[02:42:35.424 --> 02:42:40.587]  Well that's what the four Supreme Court justices have said, we've got to follow international law now, not our own.
[02:42:40.587 --> 02:42:43.790]  Right, they're trying to graft onto our system international law.
[02:42:44.747 --> 02:42:46.128]  I'll keep going over that.
[02:42:46.128 --> 02:42:54.013]  Well, you know, this is just confirmation that Obama is no different than Bush, and this has been the problem for the last, you know, four decades, basically.
[02:42:54.013 --> 02:43:02.218]  We've had presidents of both parties have continued to push the same agenda, which is sacrificing our national sovereignty and also destroying state sovereignty.
[02:43:02.218 --> 02:43:05.060]  And it's being done economically, it's being done militarily.
[02:43:05.060 --> 02:43:10.043]  NORTHCOM is the Northern Command encompasses Canada and Mexico too, not just the United States.
[02:43:10.043 --> 02:43:10.944]  No, that's what they're saying!
[02:43:10.944 --> 02:43:12.205]  NORTHCOM runs this perimeter!
[02:43:12.805 --> 02:43:13.285]  Exactly.
[02:43:13.285 --> 02:43:23.451]  So this is the integration of military, economics, and eventually government and law all into one northern hemisphere block, just like the EU.
[02:43:23.451 --> 02:43:29.435]  And people in Europe were called conspiracy theorists and nuts when they saw what happened to them, and it happened anyway.
[02:43:29.435 --> 02:43:34.658]  So we've got to get over this worrying about being labeled a conspiracy theorist.
[02:43:34.658 --> 02:43:38.240]  Well, that's just a term they throw out to get people to not look at what you're saying.
[02:43:38.840 --> 02:43:40.121]  They just say, oh, conspiracy theory.
[02:43:40.121 --> 02:43:41.423]  You're like, no, I have the document right here.
[02:43:41.423 --> 02:43:43.464]  No, no, don't look, don't look.
[02:43:43.464 --> 02:43:44.686]  Or chill your speech.
[02:43:44.686 --> 02:43:46.327]  They don't want you to talk about it.
[02:43:46.327 --> 02:43:47.228]  So you self-censor.
[02:43:47.228 --> 02:43:49.050]  Oh yeah, what do you think of the Tucson thing?
[02:43:49.050 --> 02:43:50.952]  They didn't just go after the Second Amendment.
[02:43:50.952 --> 02:44:02.563]  For every attack on the Second Amendment, there were two or three against the First Amendment, and making the Congress people sit together and saying, we can't criticize now, all this collective guilt, and then it turns out he's a liberal drug head.
[02:44:03.063 --> 02:44:04.284]  I think it's going to blow up in their faces.
[02:44:04.284 --> 02:44:06.946]  What they really did there is they jumped the shark.
[02:44:06.946 --> 02:44:09.207]  They demonized half the country.
[02:44:09.207 --> 02:44:11.508]  They've already called half the country racist.
[02:44:11.508 --> 02:44:13.650]  If you disagree with Obama, all of a sudden you're a racist.
[02:44:13.650 --> 02:44:19.774]  So even though I'm a quarter Mexican, hardly a white supremacist, but they try to label you this or that.
[02:44:19.774 --> 02:44:22.556]  And the same thing happened in the wake of the Arizona shooting.
[02:44:22.556 --> 02:44:25.357]  They tried to say, well, this is all the fault of the political right.
[02:44:25.357 --> 02:44:28.880]  The entire spectrum across the country, half the country is to blame for this.
[02:44:28.880 --> 02:44:29.980]  And all it does is tick off
[02:44:31.081 --> 02:44:37.124]  That segment of the American population and make them wake up and realize that, look, I'm being demonized now.
[02:44:37.124 --> 02:44:39.345]  Not just that guy over there that talks on the radio.
[02:44:39.345 --> 02:44:43.047]  They're telling, they're saying that... It confirms for them that this is a tyranny.
[02:44:44.045 --> 02:44:45.666]  And it confirms for them the propaganda machines.
[02:44:45.666 --> 02:44:52.289]  Now, you know, so Southern Poverty Law Center is becoming less and less effective when they try to call me a racist or a crazy person or whatever.
[02:44:52.289 --> 02:44:53.110]  Or Glenn Beck!
[02:44:53.110 --> 02:44:57.412]  Because they're calling half the country crazy and racist and violent.
[02:44:57.412 --> 02:44:59.793]  Or you don't like health care, you don't like black people.
[02:44:59.793 --> 02:45:01.574]  That's obviously ridiculous.
[02:45:01.574 --> 02:45:03.195]  Yeah, it is, and it's blowing up in their face.
[02:45:03.195 --> 02:45:07.057]  I think more people, because of the internet especially, they're starting to see the truth.
[02:45:07.057 --> 02:45:09.879]  One drop of truth is an antidote to a bucket full of crap.
[02:45:11.977 --> 02:45:15.380]  We've got about 15 minutes left with you.
[02:45:15.380 --> 02:45:17.421]  I've had a lot of questions, a lot of issues.
[02:45:17.421 --> 02:45:19.102]  What's most important for you right now?
[02:45:19.102 --> 02:45:22.005]  What's important that you're hearing from your members and supporters?
[02:45:22.005 --> 02:45:23.065]  What's going on with the Oath Keepers?
[02:45:23.065 --> 02:45:35.255]  I think the most important thing is for people to recognize the illegitimacy of martial law and to rediscover the Constitution's emergency provisions, like calling forth the militia of the several states.
[02:45:35.255 --> 02:45:39.278]  That's what you do to handle domestic... You don't rely... They know the locale.
[02:45:39.278 --> 02:45:40.299]  They're truly prepared.
[02:45:40.959 --> 02:45:44.823]  Have you heard, I've been trying to call Homeland Security for four days, they won't answer the phone.
[02:45:44.823 --> 02:45:47.986]  You know, to test if I could report terrorism, they won't answer the phone.
[02:45:47.986 --> 02:45:49.367]  They probably know it's you.
[02:45:49.367 --> 02:45:54.792]  No, we've tried from other phones or they pass us around and say call locals and they won't talk to us.
[02:45:54.792 --> 02:46:01.378]  So it's not about actually getting your information, they don't want to... No, these are phone numbers they put on flyers, you call and it just rings and rings.
[02:46:01.378 --> 02:46:02.519]  So it's all about conditioning then?
[02:46:02.519 --> 02:46:06.503]  Yeah, they're just out there scaring everybody knowing there's not any real terror that they don't promote.
[02:46:07.591 --> 02:46:23.194]  So the biggest thing we're looking at, well here's one thing I wanted to tell you about, I'm not sure if you knew, but there was a special forces colonel who was tasked with giving training at Fort Stewart, Georgia, and the training he was ordered to design was so offensive to him that he resigned his commission and left the Army.
[02:46:23.254 --> 02:46:23.815]  No, I didn't know.
[02:46:23.815 --> 02:46:24.475]  Tell us about it.
[02:46:24.475 --> 02:46:32.983]  Well, this is where you have the 1st Infantry Division, I mean, 1st Combat Brigade of the 3rd ID, that's the NORTHCOM attached unit, is stationed at Fort Stewart, Georgia.
[02:46:32.983 --> 02:46:34.004]  That's Brigade Homeland.
[02:46:34.004 --> 02:46:34.525]  That's right.
[02:46:34.525 --> 02:46:37.928]  So he was told to go there and conduct training, and it was so offensive to him.
[02:46:37.928 --> 02:46:45.395]  We don't know what he was told to do, because we haven't been able to get a hold of him yet, but it's been confirmed by two former SF, that this is an accurate story, that he
[02:46:46.716 --> 02:46:52.000]  Um, was found so objectionable that they told him to go train the troops to do that he resigned his commission and left the army.
[02:46:52.000 --> 02:46:57.203]  Well, let me tell you separately, I've confirmed what they're training the guard and regular army liaisons attached.
[02:46:57.203 --> 02:46:58.083]  I've confirmed.
[02:46:58.083 --> 02:47:06.589]  They're training to set up checkpoints, run IDs, license plate reading cameras already going in, and they just pull you out and put you in vans, trucks, or buses.
[02:47:06.589 --> 02:47:09.691]  I mean, they are, they're actually getting ready to four real red and blue list.
[02:47:10.745 --> 02:47:23.591]  Well, that's why, you know, from the very beginning, two years ago, on our list of orders, we will not obey our orders to round up the American people, or to blockade cities, or to go into a state with force, unless they've been invited by the state legislature.
[02:47:23.591 --> 02:47:28.193]  And so we want the current serving to understand that there have to be some serious hard lines.
[02:47:28.193 --> 02:47:36.217]  Martial law is totally unconstitutional, illegitimate, nowhere in the Constitution, and it has no basis, no moral force, no legal force.
[02:47:36.217 --> 02:47:37.057]  They should resist it.
[02:47:37.057 --> 02:47:38.158]  It's an illegal order.
[02:47:38.158 --> 02:47:38.638]  Absolutely.
[02:47:39.278 --> 02:47:39.818]  That is pure treason!
[02:48:09.116 --> 02:48:09.757]  Absolutely it is.
[02:48:09.757 --> 02:48:11.478]  It's making war on the American people.
[02:48:11.478 --> 02:48:12.559]  So that's how I define treason.
[02:48:12.559 --> 02:48:14.241]  That is the purest form.
[02:48:14.241 --> 02:48:25.812]  So what they're doing... He is tyrannous, but remember, he's just the figurehead, but through that office, he's preparing to try to deploy what Julius Caesar did.
[02:48:26.252 --> 02:48:26.992]  There's the problem.
[02:48:26.992 --> 02:48:29.214]  People say, well, you know, it's only happened to one or two people.
[02:48:29.214 --> 02:48:32.115]  But that's the problem, is that you don't wait for the full effect.
[02:48:32.115 --> 02:48:35.858]  You don't wait for the pretext to happen, the next terrorist attack, the next 9-11.
[02:48:35.858 --> 02:48:39.560]  You stop the, you stand on the principle.
[02:48:39.560 --> 02:48:40.660]  You oppose the principle.
[02:48:40.660 --> 02:48:44.623]  And the principle is, he can treat us like occupied Germany or Japan.
[02:48:44.623 --> 02:48:48.865]  He can treat us like a foreign enemy, and do here at home what he's done abroad to a foreign enemy.
[02:48:48.865 --> 02:48:49.505]  That's the claim.
[02:48:49.505 --> 02:48:55.769]  So we must resist that, declare it for what it is, illegitimate, void from inception, has no force and authority.
[02:48:56.270 --> 02:48:59.605]  And any order given like that should be refused by the standing military.
[02:49:01.647 --> 02:49:03.388]  Well, that's another issue.
[02:49:03.388 --> 02:49:13.996]  TSA that won't stick their hands down people's pants, who worry about the radiation, they're being fired, so government is trying to sift through and create the cadres that will do whatever they're told.
[02:49:13.996 --> 02:49:15.197]  And you should opt out every time.
[02:49:15.197 --> 02:49:15.757]  I always do.
[02:49:15.757 --> 02:49:19.480]  And unfortunately, you shouldn't have to be a lawyer to get respect.
[02:49:19.480 --> 02:49:22.842]  But last time I went through a checkpoint, I said, hey, just don't put your hands in my pants.
[02:49:22.842 --> 02:49:24.363]  The guy said, I can't guarantee that.
[02:49:24.363 --> 02:49:25.104]  I said, well, I'm a lawyer.
[02:49:25.104 --> 02:49:26.184]  I guess we'll dance afterwards.
[02:49:26.184 --> 02:49:26.825]  And he was like, whoa.
[02:49:28.305 --> 02:49:46.529]  Yeah, that's what I've, the few times I've had the issue come up, I'd go, look, I'm a radio talk show host, I usually know who I am anyways, and they're asking for signature, you know, what do you call it, autographs.
[02:49:46.529 --> 02:49:50.610]  A lot of them aren't bad people, but they're trying to get rid of those and trying to hire the bad ones.
[02:49:50.610 --> 02:49:56.071]  Because they can set that precedent to line us up, to search us, I mean, this is classic what's happening.
[02:49:56.531 --> 02:49:59.972]  They don't go to buses, and this is what we oppose categorically.
[02:49:59.972 --> 02:50:00.872]  They're already doing it.
[02:50:00.872 --> 02:50:03.153]  Checkpoints are absolutely unconstitutional.
[02:50:03.153 --> 02:50:04.953]  That's like right out of Nazi Germany.
[02:50:04.953 --> 02:50:07.154]  So I don't think there's any legitimacy at all.
[02:50:07.154 --> 02:50:08.874]  And I don't care what the courts say.
[02:50:08.874 --> 02:50:09.974]  It's not American.
[02:50:09.974 --> 02:50:11.175]  It's un-American.
[02:50:11.175 --> 02:50:14.215]  Plus they're discredited because they just cancelled the virtual fence.
[02:50:14.215 --> 02:50:16.636]  They never really built any of the physical fence.
[02:50:16.636 --> 02:50:21.497]  I mean, the southern border is wide open in a country collapsing into bedlam, and they're not worried about that?
[02:50:21.497 --> 02:50:24.278]  They're running random checkpoints on highways around the country?
[02:50:24.278 --> 02:50:25.338]  100 miles inland.
[02:50:25.578 --> 02:50:26.319]  Well, not even that.
[02:50:26.319 --> 02:50:27.941]  They're now all over the country.
[02:50:27.941 --> 02:50:29.062]  We've got the articles coming in.
[02:50:29.062 --> 02:50:32.866]  TSA, National Guard, they have families drive under x-ray machines.
[02:50:32.866 --> 02:50:34.588]  They're doing it now, Stuart.
[02:50:34.588 --> 02:50:36.270]  I mean, I see the reports every week.
[02:50:36.270 --> 02:50:37.131]  They're just pouring in.
[02:50:37.875 --> 02:50:40.776]  Yeah, they're conditioning us for more of this stuff.
[02:50:40.776 --> 02:50:42.557]  So, you know, we have to resist.
[02:50:42.557 --> 02:50:47.680]  And if you can get your sheriff to help you, that's why the Sheriff's First Bill in Montana is important.
[02:50:47.680 --> 02:50:53.843]  Any bills that can back the sheriff up with the authority of the law of the state is good.
[02:50:53.843 --> 02:50:54.503]  Absolutely.
[02:50:54.503 --> 02:50:55.463]  We're on the march.
[02:50:55.463 --> 02:50:56.804]  The empire's on the run.
[02:50:56.804 --> 02:50:58.705]  We will rebuild the republic.
[02:50:58.705 --> 02:51:00.926]  We'll be right back with Stuart Rhodes and Webster Tarpley.
[02:51:01.624 --> 02:51:05.725]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[02:51:05.725 --> 02:51:10.227]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[02:51:10.227 --> 02:51:16.369]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works for all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[02:51:16.369 --> 02:51:18.810]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[02:51:18.810 --> 02:51:24.752]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[02:51:24.892 --> 02:51:28.297]  With zero debt in 90 days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[02:51:28.297 --> 02:51:30.179]  There is no other program of its kind.
[02:51:30.179 --> 02:51:32.362]  Don't be alone when creditors gang up on you.
[02:51:32.362 --> 02:51:37.248]  Let our team of experts provide the resources to fight back and stop creditors in only 90 days.

[02:52:01.076 --> 02:52:02.237]  A very wealthy U.S.
[02:52:02.237 --> 02:52:09.222]  citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[02:52:09.222 --> 02:52:11.784]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[02:52:11.784 --> 02:52:16.988]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[02:52:17.188 --> 02:52:20.129]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[02:52:20.129 --> 02:52:22.449]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[02:52:22.449 --> 02:52:28.750]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[02:52:28.750 --> 02:52:32.131]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[02:52:32.131 --> 02:52:37.952]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[02:52:37.952 --> 02:52:39.592]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[02:52:39.592 --> 02:52:40.912]  I can't stress this enough.
[02:52:40.912 --> 02:52:43.593]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[02:52:43.593 --> 02:52:45.013]  He explains everything you need to know.
[02:52:45.293 --> 02:52:47.834]  Including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[02:52:47.834 --> 02:52:52.376]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[02:52:52.376 --> 02:52:54.997]  That's End of America, the number three, dot com.

[02:54:02.027 --> 02:54:04.453]  Yeah, I think.
[02:54:12.551 --> 02:54:17.073]  For two more segments, this five minute and the next, we've got Stuart Rhodes, founder of Oath Keepers.
[02:54:17.073 --> 02:54:23.397]  We've also got a fellow in here, John Shirley, who's a sergeant currently in the Houston PD, one of the biggest in the country.
[02:54:23.397 --> 02:54:31.901]  He has to give the proviso that he speaks privately as a citizen here, but he's with us getting into the subject of the federalization of police.
[02:54:31.901 --> 02:54:32.922]  Well, thanks for having me, Alex.
[02:54:32.922 --> 02:54:39.866]  Unfortunately, I have to say that I'm speaking for me and for Oath Keepers, the state chapter president of Oath Keepers, but I'm concerned
[02:54:40.666 --> 02:54:53.815]  The federal government has turned our police forces into an arm of the federal government, just de facto, by the fact that a lot of our training is standardized already to this day, so all police departments are basically trained the same.
[02:54:53.815 --> 02:54:57.437]  They're trying to get rid of your codes, your local codes.
[02:54:57.437 --> 02:55:08.885]  Exactly, and not just that, but the training is all standardized, and the money that comes from federal government to run programs for the police departments, with all the strings attached to it.
[02:55:09.065 --> 02:55:10.566]  And the feds are writing the codes now?
[02:55:10.566 --> 02:55:11.206]  Absolutely.
[02:55:11.206 --> 02:55:18.470]  And you know, a police chief will not cross the federal government because to do so means the money is yanked away or the money has to be paid back.
[02:55:18.470 --> 02:55:21.831]  So they basically run the police departments as it is today.
[02:55:21.831 --> 02:55:24.453]  Are the police officers starting to wake up?
[02:55:24.453 --> 02:55:25.933]  Yes, I believe they are.
[02:55:25.933 --> 02:55:35.358]  You know, they're quiet about it, but there's no question that when stuff comes down, the officers question the city or the department.
[02:55:36.775 --> 02:55:38.276]  Initially, all the time.
[02:55:38.276 --> 02:55:41.417]  They're going to ask questions.
[02:55:41.417 --> 02:55:44.257]  They need to get their local law enforcement off the federal teat.
[02:55:52.625 --> 02:56:01.687]  And have them stop taking the federal money and start taking back over their law enforcement to where they're not seen as police officers or law enforcement officers.
[02:56:01.687 --> 02:56:10.269]  Their officers are seen as peace officers who are actively in the community, working for the community, and of course, having fidelity to the Constitution.
[02:56:10.269 --> 02:56:19.251]  I've also seen a lot of instances where it seems like departments, the bad departments, try to protect people that act outrageously, and then that demonizes all the good officers that are out there.
[02:56:20.241 --> 02:56:21.322]  That's definitely a concern.
[02:56:21.322 --> 02:56:26.526]  I mean, we had in Houston the beating video that just came out in the public several days ago.
[02:56:26.526 --> 02:56:36.172]  And, you know, it pains me to think how that taints the whole police department of over 5,000 people by the misactions of eight or nine.
[02:56:36.172 --> 02:56:38.133]  But I will say, at least in Houston, they are prosecuting them.
[02:56:38.133 --> 02:56:40.475]  So hopefully the... Yeah, that's the good news.
[02:56:40.475 --> 02:56:42.076]  A lot of places they don't.
[02:56:42.076 --> 02:56:42.577]  Right.
[02:56:42.577 --> 02:56:45.258]  And then that freaks everybody out.
[02:56:45.258 --> 02:56:48.721]  But why did you get involved in Oath Keepers?
[02:56:50.236 --> 02:56:57.042]  You know, I stumbled upon the Oath Keepers website before they even rolled out the program officially.
[02:56:57.042 --> 02:57:03.109]  And I don't remember how I got onto it, but I read the 10 orders we will not do, and it was like a light bulb went off in my head.
[02:57:03.109 --> 02:57:06.012]  It's like, my God, this is exactly what we need.
[02:57:06.012 --> 02:57:09.776]  We need police that understand the seriousness of the oath they take.
[02:57:10.376 --> 02:57:11.977]  Well, look at every other country.
[02:57:11.977 --> 02:57:14.897]  It's always the military and police that are used to bring in tyranny.
[02:57:14.897 --> 02:57:16.258]  Liberty is a very rare thing.
[02:57:16.258 --> 02:57:20.719]  I mean, this is a disease that almost every country catches.
[02:57:20.719 --> 02:57:21.339]  That's right.
[02:57:21.339 --> 02:57:23.500]  We should realize the rarity of it.
[02:57:23.500 --> 02:57:28.122]  And that's why people should not try to look for silver bullets like military coups.
[02:57:28.122 --> 02:57:30.242]  They should get back to what the founders gave us.
[02:57:30.242 --> 02:57:34.644]  The lessons of history are written right in our Constitution and our Declaration of Independence.
[02:57:34.644 --> 02:57:35.604]  We've got to stick to that plan.
[02:57:36.584 --> 02:57:48.289]  Well, I mean, if we do go into a full depression and people are running around starving, if 90% of people were self-sufficient in the Great Depression, and they estimate in that 10 years close to 7 million starved to death, people were very moral back then on average.
[02:57:48.289 --> 02:58:02.395]  Today, I mean, what we saw on, you know, Black Friday with people rioting just for a cheap Xbox, it's gonna be scary and it's designed to make us beg for the martial law because it'll actually be needed if we don't have a little control.
[02:58:03.075 --> 02:58:11.378]  That's why we must preempt it by getting all our veterans, including police veterans in fact, to get up, like I said, get off the couch and go and strengthen their communities and get ready.
[02:58:11.378 --> 02:58:17.781]  And we should be starting police auxiliaries and reserves as we have state economies collapse and local economies collapse.
[02:58:17.781 --> 02:58:28.025]  They can't afford officers, so there'll be like two or three John Shirley's and then they should be backed up by a police auxiliary of volunteer citizens to be there to help them keep order when there's rioting.
[02:58:28.025 --> 02:58:29.305]  That's under local control.
[02:58:29.305 --> 02:58:29.785]  Exactly.
[02:58:31.246 --> 02:58:32.347]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:58:51.730 --> 02:58:55.312]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over.
[02:58:55.312 --> 02:58:56.432]  It ended on June of 2009.
[02:58:56.432 --> 02:59:00.995]  The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree.
[02:59:00.995 --> 02:59:06.938]  Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees, but for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:59:06.938 --> 02:59:09.099]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either.
[02:59:09.099 --> 02:59:12.141]  They've begun their long-expected journey to the moon.
[02:59:12.141 --> 02:59:18.624]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct.
[02:59:18.624 --> 02:59:20.425]  They both make fabulous investments.
[02:59:20.825 --> 02:59:26.167]  Food is our greatest dependency and we know it will be more precious than any financial resource.
[02:59:26.167 --> 02:59:31.450]  You and your family need food to survive a crisis and you can't eat paper, stocks or metals.
[02:59:31.450 --> 02:59:36.812]  Alex has been urging you to invest in delicious easy fix meals to enjoy now or save for long term.
[02:59:36.812 --> 02:59:40.013]  This will freeze the cost of your food while you can still afford it.

[02:59:52.253 --> 02:59:55.835]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:55.835 --> 02:59:59.737]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[02:59:59.737 --> 03:00:08.582]  Okay, we've only got five amazing minutes left with both these gentlemen.
[03:00:08.582 --> 03:00:13.904]  John Shirley, of course, the state chapter head of Oath Keepers, and the founder, Stuart Rhodes, here with us.
[03:00:13.904 --> 03:00:16.866]  We were talking during that one-minute break about something so important.
[03:00:16.866 --> 03:00:20.168]  What I'm saying is, the feds are creating a spy network
[03:00:20.788 --> 03:00:27.776]  Through InfraGard, of dentists, of doctors, of quote, professionals, to spy on people.
[03:00:27.776 --> 03:00:29.898]  They've approached my dad, they've approached other dentists he knows.
[03:00:29.898 --> 03:00:31.680]  I mean, this is a massive program.
[03:00:31.680 --> 03:00:36.686]  They know this vacuum's coming, so they're trying to create a federally, locally controlled militia.
[03:00:36.686 --> 03:00:38.868]  We need the true local.
[03:00:38.868 --> 03:00:40.270]  I mean, guys, talk about that.
[03:00:40.350 --> 03:00:45.954]  Well, they're trying to co-opt every infrastructure in the state and local government, the police.
[03:00:45.954 --> 03:00:52.600]  We've seen the working group for countering violent extremism that Southern Poverty Law Center is now sitting on in DHS.
[03:00:52.600 --> 03:01:03.948]  Their recommendations are, is to train and reach into mental health workers, family service workers, teachers, enlisting all of the... Cable repair guys?
[03:01:03.948 --> 03:01:07.771]  Yeah, everybody, to spy on and to combat violent extremism.
[03:01:07.771 --> 03:01:08.212]  Firemen?
[03:01:09.076 --> 03:01:10.017]  Yeah, absolutely everyone.
[03:01:10.017 --> 03:01:12.819]  That's why we reach out to all those institutions as well.
[03:01:12.819 --> 03:01:21.705]  We reach out to police and fire because we understand that they are going to be, they're being told right now, you know, if you go into a home and you see something suspicious, you'll let us know about it.
[03:01:21.705 --> 03:01:24.447]  And they're not even really saying piles of cocaine.
[03:01:24.447 --> 03:01:30.451]  It's if you go in there and they got reloading equipment, we're seeing realtors calling police on people when they see reloading or guns.
[03:01:30.911 --> 03:01:31.091]  Right.
[03:01:50.526 --> 03:01:53.407]  And the feds are moving in many states to get rid of sheriffs altogether.
[03:02:13.407 --> 03:02:15.588]  Well, they want the sheriff to be an appointed official.
[03:02:15.588 --> 03:02:17.610]  Yeah, and that's getting rid of him.
[03:02:17.610 --> 03:02:20.391]  Yeah, it's gutting what the sheriff does, what the sheriff is.
[03:02:20.391 --> 03:02:22.233]  Well, that's an attack on the Constitution right there.
[03:02:22.233 --> 03:02:23.994]  That's in all the state constitutions, the sheriff.
[03:02:24.718 --> 03:02:44.275]  Well, so we have to fight back at the local level and we're now part of the 10th Amendment Center Nullify Now Tour going around the country and talking about state sovereignty and standing up and the doctrine of interposition, of the responsibility and duty of the state to interpose itself between the federal government and the citizenry when the feds cross the lines of
[03:02:44.575 --> 03:02:48.419]  And what's great is you're getting, not exhausted, but running all over the country yourself.
[03:02:48.419 --> 03:02:59.889]  You're finding other great leaders like John Shirley and others who can be force multipliers to speak to even more groups and folks can find out how to get you guys or other great state chapter leaders to come speak on the Oath Keepers website.
[03:03:00.049 --> 03:03:00.530]  That's right.
[03:03:00.530 --> 03:03:01.451]  Oathkeepers.org.
[03:03:01.451 --> 03:03:05.776]  They can go there and we have a free forum for Texas here as well and all the other states.
[03:03:05.776 --> 03:03:08.378]  So they can go there and find all the local chapters?
[03:03:08.378 --> 03:03:09.039]  Absolutely.
[03:03:09.039 --> 03:03:14.145]  And people can just get information from the site or they can become full-fledged members if they're in the military or police?
[03:03:15.066 --> 03:03:15.667]  You come to a point
[03:03:32.301 --> 03:03:32.781]  We're good to go.
[03:03:52.518 --> 03:03:55.841]  You know, there comes a time you've got to stand up and say, look, that's it.
[03:03:55.841 --> 03:03:57.282]  They're already coming down on us.
[03:03:57.282 --> 03:03:58.763]  That's why I admire both of you.
[03:03:58.763 --> 03:04:03.327]  Well, frankly, to the veterans, I say you've got no reason not to stand up.
[03:04:03.327 --> 03:04:04.908]  Current serving, I can see that.
[03:04:04.908 --> 03:04:08.972]  It's kind of nice to have, you know, the icebergs theory of a visible tip like him.
[03:04:08.972 --> 03:04:11.253]  But there's also the guys you don't know are there.
[03:04:11.253 --> 03:04:14.536]  And that makes the, you know, the elites worry and stay awake at night.
[03:04:14.536 --> 03:04:18.059]  And they know we've got truth and justice on our side.
[03:04:18.059 --> 03:04:19.260]  And people hunger for that.
[03:04:19.420 --> 03:04:20.721]  I mean, we're good.
[03:04:20.721 --> 03:04:21.621]  People can sense it.
[03:04:21.621 --> 03:04:22.542]  They know it.
[03:04:22.542 --> 03:04:23.863]  We're historically right.
[03:04:23.863 --> 03:04:25.704]  They can see all the signs that we've been right.
[03:04:25.704 --> 03:04:27.505]  And it's just make a choice, folks.
[03:04:27.505 --> 03:04:29.626]  Decide where you're going to be in history.
[03:04:29.626 --> 03:04:36.550]  I mean, don't wait till later and lie in your beds, you know, wishing many years from now, as Braveheart said, that you'd done the right thing.
[03:04:36.550 --> 03:04:42.833]  Well, as Thomas Paine said, if there is going to be trouble, let it come in my day so that my child will have peace.
[03:04:42.833 --> 03:04:43.934]  And that's how I feel about it.
[03:04:44.594 --> 03:04:45.995]  I'm gonna die anyway.
[03:04:45.995 --> 03:04:47.276]  So let's stand up right now.
[03:04:47.276 --> 03:04:49.877]  And if we all stand up together, we can't be stopped.
[03:04:49.877 --> 03:04:50.758]  No, we can't be stopped.
[03:04:50.758 --> 03:04:51.978]  We got the good guys.
[03:04:51.978 --> 03:04:52.879]  They got the bad guys.
[03:04:52.879 --> 03:04:54.720]  The bad guys are a bunch of scum, folks.
[03:04:54.720 --> 03:04:55.721]  We can defeat these people.
[03:04:55.721 --> 03:04:57.482]  Gentlemen, great having you in here with us.
[03:04:57.482 --> 03:04:58.062]  Amazing.
[03:04:58.062 --> 03:05:01.804]  Webster Tarfully on Egypt, straight ahead.
[03:05:01.804 --> 03:05:04.646]  This special announcement is brought to you by Renaissance Charge.
[03:05:05.370 --> 03:05:10.513]  Have you ever wondered if you could make your car run on 100% electric power for free?
[03:05:10.513 --> 03:05:11.874]  It is now possible!
[03:05:11.874 --> 03:05:17.657]  How about a simple device that is both a super efficient motor and a free energy generator at the same time?
[03:05:17.657 --> 03:05:22.720]  What if this could also be used to restore useless batteries and save you lots of money?
[03:05:22.720 --> 03:05:31.686]  Because our customers asked for it, we have organized a Renaissance Charge Conference Workshop on July 29th to July 31st at the beautiful Coeur d'Alene Resort in Idaho.
[03:05:32.026 --> 03:05:38.851]  Not only will you see these fascinating energizers, but you will be able to build some alongside genius inventor John Bodini.
[03:05:38.851 --> 03:05:44.274]  Participate in this truly historic event featuring our cutting-edge alternative energy, Tesla Technology.
[03:05:44.274 --> 03:05:48.977]  Register early for the best seats and advanced workshop by visiting rcharge.com.
[03:05:48.977 --> 03:05:51.999]  That's r-charge.com for details.

[03:05:52.459 --> 03:05:52.740]  That's 208-772-4514.
[03:06:01.158 --> 03:06:09.322]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[03:06:09.322 --> 03:06:11.884]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[03:06:11.884 --> 03:06:17.286]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children, and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[03:06:17.286 --> 03:06:20.228]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[03:06:20.228 --> 03:06:22.309]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[03:06:22.549 --> 03:06:28.833]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[03:06:28.833 --> 03:06:32.235]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[03:06:32.235 --> 03:06:38.058]  Recently, he created a video, which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet.
[03:06:38.058 --> 03:06:39.699]  And it's a real eye-opener.
[03:06:39.699 --> 03:06:41.020]  I can't stress this enough.
[03:06:41.020 --> 03:06:43.702]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[03:06:43.702 --> 03:06:47.944]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[03:06:47.944 --> 03:06:50.886]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica.com.
[03:06:52.827 --> 03:07:07.491]  Did you know that drinking pure, high alkaline water is one of the most important factors in maintaining high energy and vibrant health?
[03:07:07.491 --> 03:07:11.933]  Most experts agree that the water you drink should be at a pH level of 8 or higher.
[03:07:11.933 --> 03:07:19.035]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops, available only at AlkaVision.com, combine a unique formula of only the most alkaline minerals.
[03:07:19.295 --> 03:07:26.220]  AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops alkalize your water, ridding the body of harmful toxins and helps you regain health and energy.
[03:07:26.220 --> 03:07:34.266]  Alkalizing your water by simply adding 10 drops of AlkaVision Plasma pH Drops helps the body rid itself of acidic waste, increases oxygen content,
[03:07:34.326 --> 03:07:34.686]  I think so.
[03:08:02.918 --> 03:08:09.564]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[03:08:09.564 --> 03:08:12.527]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:13.001 --> 03:08:16.145]  That's right, the globalists have basically occupied this country and many others.
[03:08:16.145 --> 03:08:18.447]  We're trying to get our republic back.
[03:08:18.447 --> 03:08:25.015]  And we had Webster pop in earlier for five minutes, but I wanted to have him come back live here to recap and get into the latest developments.
[03:08:25.015 --> 03:08:28.579]  They are announcing that Hosni Mubarak, in the last few hours, is going to step down.
[03:08:28.579 --> 03:08:31.542]  Now, they've been saying this for three weeks to create a self-fulfilling prophecy.
[03:08:31.542 --> 03:08:33.464]  We're not fans of the dictator, Hosni Mubarak.
[03:08:34.105 --> 03:08:41.992]  The issue here is, it's admitted that our government, Israel and others, even though they claim they like Mubarak, have been telling him to step down.
[03:08:41.992 --> 03:08:53.582]  It is admitted, and Leon Panetta, before this announcement, earlier today, gave testimony in Congress that they were telling him to step down, even step down, or make the announcement of stepping down today.
[03:08:53.582 --> 03:08:55.503]  What is the overall strategy?
[03:08:55.503 --> 03:08:56.644]  What's happening here?
[03:08:56.644 --> 03:09:00.868]  Glenn Beck is saying it's the Muslim Ottoman Empire, the caliphate coming back.
[03:09:01.368 --> 03:09:02.389]  Well, in a way, that's true.
[03:09:02.389 --> 03:09:05.651]  They're trying to destabilize the Middle East.
[03:09:05.651 --> 03:09:07.852]  What's the larger geopolitical aims?
[03:09:07.852 --> 03:09:11.154]  Historian, doctor of history, also in economics.
[03:09:11.154 --> 03:09:14.336]  He has a doctorate in history, but he's also an economist.
[03:09:14.336 --> 03:09:16.056]  He is Webster Griffin Tarpley.
[03:09:16.056 --> 03:09:17.277]  He's also an author.
[03:09:17.277 --> 03:09:23.181]  Wrote the unauthorized biography of George Herbert Walker Bush and the unauthorized biography of Barack Hussein Obama.
[03:09:23.181 --> 03:09:25.642]  You've got the floor for the next 12 minutes, sir.
[03:09:25.642 --> 03:09:28.584]  Break down exactly what's happening here.
[03:09:29.224 --> 03:09:32.748]  Well, the first thing I would say is there may be now a counter coup in process.
[03:09:32.748 --> 03:09:46.902]  It's been four or five hours since Leon Panetta opened his big yap at the House Intelligence Committee hearing in the Capitol here in Washington this morning, saying, oh, there's a very strong likelihood that Mubarak will be out.
[03:09:47.382 --> 03:09:51.584]  By the end of the day, and I think you realize that this was a very stupid thing to do.
[03:09:51.584 --> 03:10:00.748]  A new low of stupidity even for the CIA, because imagine you're a nationalist Egyptian officer or even, you know, a normal Egyptian.
[03:10:00.748 --> 03:10:03.909]  Your country's future is being announced in Washington, D.C.
[03:10:03.909 --> 03:10:05.530]  by the head of the CIA.
[03:10:05.530 --> 03:10:10.372]  You might, some of these people should, they might die of shame as a result of this.
[03:10:10.772 --> 03:10:20.054]  So there could be a nationalist backlash of nationalist officers in the Egyptian military and elsewhere that don't want to go along with this, right?
[03:10:21.084 --> 03:10:25.907]  Typically, if the generals want to go one way, the colonels might want to go another way.
[03:10:25.907 --> 03:10:31.630]  That's what happened in Egypt in 1952 when Nasser came in as the revolt of the colonels.
[03:10:31.630 --> 03:10:34.191]  There might also be an inter-service rivalry.
[03:10:34.191 --> 03:10:42.516]  If we're going to have a military junta, they may be fighting over the seats in that military junta, and if the army is getting too many seats,
[03:10:43.056 --> 03:10:50.262]  Remember, the Air Force is where Mubarak came from, and the attitude of the Air Force has been kind of a question mark.
[03:10:50.262 --> 03:10:52.204]  Much of his cabinet is Air Force.
[03:10:52.204 --> 03:10:56.948]  Right, so maybe the Air Force is fighting the Army for seats in the Junta.
[03:10:56.948 --> 03:11:01.452]  Anyway, I don't think it was very smart of Panetta to announce this.
[03:11:01.452 --> 03:11:04.815]  On the other hand, that may be what they had to do.
[03:11:04.815 --> 03:11:05.756]  In other words, the U.S.
[03:11:05.756 --> 03:11:09.659]  side, it seems to me they saw that these crowds were dwindling.
[03:11:09.659 --> 03:11:10.340]  There was a big
[03:11:11.000 --> 03:11:15.123]  It's hysteria in the last couple of days that the crowds were bigger than they ever were.
[03:11:15.123 --> 03:11:22.788]  But if you look at what they did, they filled in most of that square with a tent city where no people could really go and mill around.
[03:11:22.788 --> 03:11:30.054]  So, it seemed to me they were dealing with a fairly anemic, fairly feeble response to all this demagogy.
[03:11:30.054 --> 03:11:34.817]  And the golden youth were there, yes, the golden youth were there overnight.
[03:11:35.397 --> 03:11:40.681]  And the Muslim Brotherhood would come in on Fridays and other days when they wanted something.
[03:11:40.681 --> 03:11:43.343]  I don't think they ever got much over 50,000.
[03:11:43.343 --> 03:11:46.865]  And I think if they had, they would have shown it to us, right?
[03:11:46.865 --> 03:11:51.829]  Compare what you've seen in that square in Cairo to the Obama inauguration.
[03:11:51.829 --> 03:11:57.553]  The Obama inauguration was indeed something in the area of three quarters of a million or something like this.
[03:11:57.553 --> 03:11:59.895]  Nothing like that in Egypt.
[03:12:00.555 --> 03:12:03.478]  Yeah, this looks more like a sports stadium of 60,000 people.
[03:12:03.478 --> 03:12:06.761]  They keep showing tight shots of it on Al Jazeera.
[03:12:06.761 --> 03:12:08.543]  What's the reason for all this?
[03:12:08.543 --> 03:12:14.949]  Why is the West now admitting that they engineered this against their own bloodthirsty ally?
[03:12:25.419 --> 03:12:29.262]  Well, again, bloodthirsty, you know, in the sense of war, I think not.
[03:12:29.262 --> 03:12:31.203]  In other words, what's the big U.S.
[03:12:31.203 --> 03:12:31.983]  project?
[03:12:31.983 --> 03:12:34.805]  It's been, since 2004, 2005, is to assemble this united front of countries
[03:12:40.769 --> 03:12:48.056]  It would be the Arabs, and above all that means the Sunni Arabs, and that of course means Egypt, but also the others.
[03:12:48.056 --> 03:12:59.086]  The Sunni Arab countries, together with the United States, however, together with Israel, and the key element of this, the creation of an anti-Iranian, anti-Shiite front,
[03:12:59.847 --> 03:13:15.174]  Depended on having a nuclear umbrella, nuclear protection extended by the United States to these countries, to Israel, to Egypt, to the Gulf States, the Emirates, Kuwait, Oman, and so forth, and to Saudi Arabia.
[03:13:15.174 --> 03:13:20.576]  And right in the middle of that, in August of 2009, Mubarak said, no, I don't want it.
[03:13:20.576 --> 03:13:22.617]  He said, this is a bribe to the Israelis.
[03:13:22.617 --> 03:13:24.398]  I don't want to normalize
[03:13:24.938 --> 03:13:33.224]  With the Israelis without, you know, negotiating, you know, a series of issues that are my issues, Egyptian issues.
[03:13:33.224 --> 03:13:35.786]  And after Mubarak had opposed this U.S.
[03:13:35.786 --> 03:13:38.208]  nuclear umbrella, because this is not a good thing, right?
[03:13:38.208 --> 03:13:38.968]  That means the U.S.
[03:13:38.968 --> 03:13:41.990]  gets involved immediately in any war in the Middle East.
[03:13:41.990 --> 03:13:43.431]  I don't think we want this.
[03:13:43.431 --> 03:13:50.096]  Mubarak took the stand, and then the Saudis were then also able to say, we also don't want this.
[03:13:50.096 --> 03:13:53.259]  We don't want this, the normalization with Israel.
[03:13:54.159 --> 03:13:54.759]  What the U.S.
[03:13:54.759 --> 03:14:02.963]  was trying to do was to create a military alliance that would lock in Egypt and the Saudis and the Israelis all in one united front.
[03:14:02.963 --> 03:14:08.005]  This is a very uncomfortable position for Arab leaders to be in.
[03:14:08.005 --> 03:14:09.765]  So he said, no.
[03:14:09.765 --> 03:14:12.967]  He also said, hey, U.S., in 2006, 2007, you're trying to get out of Iraq too fast.
[03:14:16.788 --> 03:14:18.950]  That may turn out to be prophetic.
[03:14:18.950 --> 03:14:33.922]  The other thing was during that Israeli-Lebanon war, the attack on Lebanon by the Israelis in the summer of 2006, Mubarak was trying to promote, trying to mediate a contact between the Israelis and the Syrians
[03:14:34.662 --> 03:14:36.404]  To try to end it.
[03:14:36.404 --> 03:14:37.586]  And he said the U.S.
[03:14:37.586 --> 03:14:39.648]  at that time, the Bush administration, the U.S.
[03:14:39.648 --> 03:14:47.116]  was sabotaging the effort to have a direct channel between Israel and Syria to put an end to it.
[03:14:47.116 --> 03:14:49.179]  So there's lots and lots of friction.
[03:14:49.179 --> 03:14:51.782]  Mubarak is well entrenched, or was well entrenched.
[03:14:52.242 --> 03:14:54.023]  He was somebody with a mind of his own.
[03:14:54.023 --> 03:14:55.144]  He wasn't a nationalist.
[03:14:55.144 --> 03:14:56.385]  He was gruff.
[03:14:56.385 --> 03:14:57.026]  He was old.
[03:14:57.026 --> 03:14:57.726]  He was stubborn.
[03:14:57.726 --> 03:14:58.827]  He was prickly.
[03:14:58.827 --> 03:14:59.367]  The U.S.
[03:14:59.367 --> 03:15:01.369]  was not getting what they wanted.
[03:15:01.369 --> 03:15:14.438]  And again, the last contact I know of is a telephone call from Obama to Mubarak on January 19th, in which Obama says, thank you for supporting what we're doing in Lebanon with this commission, which is this
[03:15:15.539 --> 03:15:26.363]  Fake kangaroo court where they're going to indict Hezbollah and blame them for the death of Hariri when there really is no proof and there are half a dozen candidates.
[03:15:26.363 --> 03:15:31.525]  As many countries as have secret intelligence in the Middle East.
[03:15:31.525 --> 03:15:32.425]  You can go through the list.
[03:15:33.105 --> 03:15:40.853]  But they're going to put it all on Hezbollah and Mubarak could say that's simply a recipe for destabilization and possible war.
[03:15:40.853 --> 03:15:42.575]  So he has opposed it.
[03:15:42.575 --> 03:15:45.758]  But Obama then calls him up and says, thank you for supporting what I'm doing.
[03:15:45.758 --> 03:15:49.241]  I'm sure Mubarak said, look, I don't support what you're doing.
[03:15:49.241 --> 03:15:52.905]  So that was the 19th of January and that's about a week before
[03:15:54.446 --> 03:16:07.132]  The National Endowment for Democracy and the International Republican Institute and these other groups essentially gave the signal to mobilize, right, by Twitter and Facebook, led by this guy, Conem.
[03:16:07.132 --> 03:16:12.395]  The Lenin, the Robespierre of the revolution, is a Google executive.
[03:16:12.395 --> 03:16:13.356]  His name is Conem.
[03:16:13.356 --> 03:16:17.598]  He's this sort of squirrely guy you saw on television yesterday.
[03:16:17.598 --> 03:16:21.020]  And that's supposedly the charismatic leader.
[03:16:21.849 --> 03:16:22.149]  I don't know.
[03:16:39.128 --> 03:16:43.813]  Suleiman is in contact with the Israelis, with the CIA, and all the rest of it.
[03:16:43.813 --> 03:16:50.100]  Will it be Suleiman as essentially a military dictator, or at least a first among equals?
[03:16:50.100 --> 03:16:52.463]  Or will it be a military junta?
[03:16:52.463 --> 03:17:00.091]  And they say that the military junta would likely include Tantawi, the defense minister, and General Sami Annan,
[03:17:01.332 --> 03:17:01.993]  We're good to go.
[03:17:17.231 --> 03:17:22.337]  To have the two top officers, the people who would direct the military response, out of the country.
[03:17:22.337 --> 03:17:35.252]  But I think it's probably more likely now that Tantawi and Inan were in Washington to prepare the overthrow of Mubarak, and they were simply overtaken by these street demonstrations going faster than they thought.
[03:17:36.807 --> 03:17:42.830]  In these cases, when you have a color revolution, the coup d'etat is always something behind the scenes.
[03:17:42.830 --> 03:17:49.013]  In many cases, the color revolution occurs when the coup d'etat has already happened.
[03:17:49.013 --> 03:17:51.674]  When the changes have been made behind the scenes.
[03:17:51.674 --> 03:17:52.375]  When the U.S.
[03:17:52.375 --> 03:17:54.916]  has bought and corrupted or blackmailed or whatever.
[03:17:55.516 --> 03:18:01.298]  Various players in the military and the bureaucracy to get the solution that they want next.
[03:18:01.298 --> 03:18:04.560]  And they want somebody much weaker than Mubarak.
[03:18:04.560 --> 03:18:05.820]  Much more pliable.
[03:18:05.820 --> 03:18:06.940]  Much more of a U.S.
[03:18:06.940 --> 03:18:10.022]  puppet than Mubarak had become.
[03:18:10.022 --> 03:18:14.563]  So, it seems to me that there's a good case that the U.S.
[03:18:14.563 --> 03:18:18.425]  plan was to have these two generals, Pantalei and Aman,
[03:18:19.205 --> 03:18:20.686]  We've only got one minute left.
[03:18:20.686 --> 03:18:22.866]  You're saying there may be a counter-coup.
[03:18:22.866 --> 03:18:23.947]  In closing, what do you see happening?
[03:18:38.712 --> 03:18:40.434]  Well, there could be a counter-coup.
[03:18:40.434 --> 03:18:40.975]  I don't know that.
[03:18:40.975 --> 03:18:43.297]  If Mubarak doesn't come out and speak tonight, then it's a counter-coup.
[03:18:43.297 --> 03:18:53.808]  But the thing that we know, if this junta comes in, or if Suleiman takes over under these conditions, under CIA sponsorship, the attack on Iran comes closer.
[03:18:53.808 --> 03:18:54.970]  This is what people have to see.
[03:18:55.390 --> 03:18:59.273]  But all this nice rhetoric about democracy and the Golden Youth is all baloney.
[03:18:59.273 --> 03:19:02.816]  It means that the attack on Iran becomes more likely.
[03:19:02.816 --> 03:19:05.658]  Because Mubarak was somebody who said, no, I don't want that.
[03:19:05.658 --> 03:19:11.382]  And the Saudis were strengthened by him to say, no, we probably want to, you know, cool that, you know, somehow.
[03:19:11.382 --> 03:19:12.423]  We don't want to be involved.
[03:19:12.423 --> 03:19:13.204]  You do it.
[03:19:13.204 --> 03:19:15.345]  We're going to sit this one out.
[03:19:15.345 --> 03:19:18.628]  So the thing makes a general war in the Middle East more likely.
[03:19:19.148 --> 03:19:25.552]  So for all of Israel's talk about liking Mubarak, they've really been the ones pushing for the attack on Iran.
[03:19:25.552 --> 03:19:26.973]  Are they involved in this?
[03:19:26.973 --> 03:19:27.653]  Who?
[03:19:27.653 --> 03:19:29.014]  The Israelis.
[03:19:29.014 --> 03:19:34.717]  I think the Israelis probably have a dual posture, just like the United States.
[03:19:34.717 --> 03:19:36.378]  But in their heart of hearts, do they want it?
[03:19:37.336 --> 03:19:45.441]  I think Netanyahu would probably say his life is easier if Mubarak stays, but the Mossad may say, no, we have our own approach to this.
[03:19:45.441 --> 03:19:46.542]  We're going with the U.S.
[03:19:46.542 --> 03:19:47.462]  or whatever it is.
[03:19:47.462 --> 03:19:48.923]  Alright, Webster, thank you so much.
[03:19:48.923 --> 03:19:51.565]  Tarpley.net, our websites are InfoWars.com.
[03:19:51.565 --> 03:19:53.606]  And Webster G. Tarpley on Twitter.
[03:19:53.606 --> 03:19:57.148]  Alright, we'll continue to follow as it unfolds.
[03:19:57.148 --> 03:19:58.949]  Webster, thank you so much for spending time with us.
[03:19:58.949 --> 03:19:59.990]  Very interesting information.
