[00:31.880 --> 00:40.840]  getting used to saying 2010 by the time I away from saying 2009 2010 was over
[00:40.840 --> 00:47.800]  it's 2011 we've got Max Kaiser joining us to get into what's happening with the
[00:47.800 --> 00:51.240]  stock market consolidations that are going on worldwide and some big
[00:51.240 --> 00:55.240]  developments there and then the founder of Oath Keepers constitutional lawyer and
[00:55.240 --> 01:00.960]  veteran Stuart Rhodes will be joining us in studio today in the third hour so
[01:00.960 --> 01:07.320]  that will be extremely informative you know yesterday Janet Napolitano came
[01:07.320 --> 01:14.320]  out on the heels of the house not reauthorizing on Tuesday the USA Patriot
[01:14.320 --> 01:18.040]  Act they're going to try to re-ram it through sometime this week or next week
[01:18.040 --> 01:21.960]  I've got a campaign for Liberty Alert dealing with that we're going to be
[01:21.960 --> 01:28.960]  going over but she came out and said we're facing the greatest threat since
[01:28.960 --> 01:33.640]  9-11 that we're at Red Alert they were just basically permanently on Red Alert
[01:33.640 --> 01:37.920]  and that the biggest threat is domestic groups so it's not men in caves now it's
[01:37.920 --> 01:42.800]  your neighbor it's people hiding under the table it's people at Walmart it's
[01:42.800 --> 01:47.920]  it's just the terrorists are everywhere but since Sunday on air and off air we've
[01:47.920 --> 01:55.040]  been trying to call Homeland Security and report who and we're all a locky who
[01:55.040 --> 02:00.600]  even CBS News is reporting today is now the leader of al-Qaeda it's not bin
[02:00.600 --> 02:06.440]  Laden they're now saying he is number one so the number one al-Qaeda leader
[02:06.440 --> 02:10.640]  reportedly and confirmed hanging out secretly at the Pentagon getting orders
[02:10.640 --> 02:14.960]  and it's all hidden in plain view and the Austin Police Department won't take
[02:14.960 --> 02:20.480]  my report the FBI and Dallas won't take it DHS and DC won't take it they won't
[02:20.480 --> 02:25.040]  take it now we know why they won't take it but isn't it the law they've got to
[02:25.040 --> 02:30.960]  take a report when I'm here trying to say here's Fox News and more all a locky
[02:30.960 --> 02:39.360]  secretly dined and hung out with the top brass and the Secretary of the Army two
[02:39.360 --> 02:43.320]  months after now 11 when he was on the news is one of the masterminds and he's
[02:43.320 --> 02:48.560]  run the underwear bombing reportedly the Times Square attack the Fort Hood
[02:48.560 --> 02:54.940]  situation and then we're sitting here just accepting all of this fear mongering
[02:54.940 --> 02:58.560]  Janet Napolitano says we're probably gonna get hit soon give up all your
[02:58.560 --> 03:06.440]  rights tattle on your neighbor everyone could be a terrorist it's like that movie
[03:06.440 --> 03:11.720]  the thing the remake that came out in the 80s where nobody knows you know who
[03:11.720 --> 03:18.200]  the who the shapeshifting alien is there at the frozen outpost and everybody's
[03:18.200 --> 03:21.640]  looking at each other and they're telling us terrorists are everywhere when
[03:21.640 --> 03:24.840]  you look at your neighbor they could secretly be an al-Qaeda meanwhile we
[03:24.840 --> 03:28.880]  know al-Qaeda is a globalist creation and we know the globalist are using this
[03:28.880 --> 03:32.800]  as a pretext to take our liberties and clamp down so the offshore banks can
[03:32.800 --> 03:37.520]  further vertically integrate and loot the economy and here it is out of CBS
[03:37.520 --> 03:41.600]  news today Times Square mastermind bigger threat than bin Laden the

[03:51.440 --> 03:55.280]  Security the American born cleric who we know works for the globalist behind
[03:55.280 --> 03:59.560]  the tip of Times Square bombing has now eclipsed bin Laden as the biggest
[03:59.560 --> 04:04.840]  threat to America reports CBS news see and then in Palatano is telling us
[04:04.840 --> 04:08.400]  he's gonna he's gonna get you see I know how to analyze the globalist attack
[04:08.400 --> 04:14.040]  profile years beforehand and we've been telling you Tarpoli's synthetic terror

[04:25.280 --> 04:28.200]  they're not going to go for high tech staged events like 9-11 now where they
[04:28.200 --> 04:31.480]  got a blow-up building seven in front of everybody and admit they blow it up and
[04:31.480 --> 04:37.480]  then say you didn't hear that abracadabra go back to sleep by the way it's now
[04:37.480 --> 04:41.560]  come out and confirmed our original analysis that it is the power plant
[04:41.560 --> 04:47.680]  shutdowns that caused the blackouts not 50 malfunctions at power plants as the
[04:47.680 --> 04:53.120]  White House lied last Friday pray for us folks we're under serious globalist

[06:04.960 --> 06:08.720]  one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[06:08.720 --> 06:13.240]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[06:13.240 --> 06:17.440]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity
[06:17.440 --> 06:22.080]  in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[06:22.080 --> 06:26.080]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[06:26.080 --> 06:30.200]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[06:30.200 --> 06:34.160]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[06:34.160 --> 06:38.320]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[06:38.320 --> 06:42.120]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar

[07:59.880 --> 08:05.400]  genesis communications radio network proudly presents the Alex Jones show
[08:05.400 --> 08:10.080]  because there's a war on for your mind
[08:20.840 --> 08:27.160]  it is Thursday the 10th day of February 2011 we'll be here for the next three
[08:27.160 --> 08:30.960]  hours probably four hours think I'm gonna do the whole four-hour transmission
[08:30.960 --> 08:35.480]  today Max Kaiser popping in next hour Stuart Rhodes constitutional lawyer
[08:35.480 --> 08:41.040]  former Ron Paul staffer veteran founder of Oath Keepers will be in studio with
[08:41.040 --> 08:45.840]  us and Mike Adams called and was gonna be in town I wanted to drop by some
[08:45.840 --> 08:50.240]  superfoods for me because I guess he loves us we love him too so I put in a
[08:50.240 --> 08:53.960]  call he hadn't called back ten minutes ago about maybe having him in studio in
[08:53.960 --> 08:58.800]  the fourth hour what a treat to hear he's in town and one who want to say
[08:58.800 --> 09:01.880]  hi to him so that might be a surprise if not I'll probably just go ahead and do
[09:01.880 --> 09:06.800]  the fourth hour because we've got so much news to cover you know I talk about
[09:06.800 --> 09:12.280]  this a lot now there have been times where maybe once a year in my 16 years on
[09:12.280 --> 09:17.440]  air that everything really comes together and there's so much news that it
[09:17.440 --> 09:22.560]  it just shakes me to my very core how right we've been how incredible this
[09:22.560 --> 09:28.720]  criminal takeover is and in that criminal takeover is the strength that it's so
[09:28.720 --> 09:32.720]  brazen it's so over the top that it blindsides people but that's also the
[09:32.720 --> 09:38.040]  weakness of the system is its strength because it's so ridiculously corrupt and
[09:38.040 --> 09:42.800]  and despotic that if we get people to be shaken out of their television induced
[09:42.800 --> 09:47.280]  trance that it's plain for them to see if we can just get them out of their
[09:47.280 --> 09:51.440]  trance then we can start reversing the situation a lot of people are waking up
[09:51.440 --> 09:57.840]  others aren't waking up they're going into deeper denial but the news here in
[09:57.840 --> 10:07.320]  front of me is just unbelievable it is confirmed by the Texas Energy Commission
[10:07.320 --> 10:12.560]  that yes there were not mechanical malfunctions at 50 plus power plants as
[10:12.560 --> 10:17.800]  the White House said that federal energy policy in the last two years has stopped
[10:17.800 --> 10:22.840]  new plants from opening up in all of the states affected by rolling blackouts
[10:22.840 --> 10:28.440]  that are still ongoing every time these new polar cyclones come in these
[10:28.440 --> 10:33.480]  blizzards that are even affecting Mexico and it's snowing in many areas of
[10:33.480 --> 10:38.360]  northern Mexico and 30 plus animals died at one of their zoos I mean it's
[10:38.360 --> 10:42.360]  really cold weather obviously that's taxing it but if they would have built
[10:42.360 --> 10:47.560]  the power plants they needed it wouldn't be taxed I mean growing up in Texas
[10:47.560 --> 10:50.920]  during hot weather we didn't have rolling blackouts ever growing up in
[10:50.920 --> 10:54.520]  Dallas now they do in the summer we didn't have rolling blackouts during
[10:54.520 --> 10:59.960]  cold weather now we do and we've got the Heritage Foundation the list goes on and
[10:59.960 --> 11:04.760]  on breaking down that yes our analysis last week was correct that's why the
[11:04.760 --> 11:09.920]  White House responds I've done deep study but it doesn't even take deep
[11:09.920 --> 11:14.120]  study now it's all out in the open they're coming in with select interest
[11:14.120 --> 11:18.120]  just like fascist and authoritarians always do shutting down their
[11:18.120 --> 11:22.360]  competition thus creating artificial scarcity and increasing profits and
[11:22.360 --> 11:26.600]  control of the insiders like General Electric who basically runs the White
[11:26.600 --> 11:33.640]  House now and here are the reports White House lies on blackouts exposed
[11:33.640 --> 11:38.600]  presentplanet.com and he's got the quotes here where it is confirmed the
[11:38.600 --> 11:45.760]  Texas reliability electric council has confirmed that there weren't mechanical
[11:45.760 --> 11:51.520]  malfunctions it was energy policy here's another report out of CBS News out of
[11:51.520 --> 11:58.000]  Dallas today North Texas could see more rolling blackouts continuing massive
[11:58.000 --> 12:04.360]  closures of US coal plants loom shoe says and they're announcing that they're
[12:04.360 --> 12:08.120]  just going to start shutting down most of the US power plants I mean it's
[12:08.120 --> 12:14.000]  this is the policy this is the strategic economic warfare I mean do you think I
[12:14.000 --> 12:20.840]  make a 13-minute video charging Obama with treason because I want to have
[12:20.840 --> 12:24.800]  some shocking headline that's dangerous for me to do I'm on the White House
[12:24.800 --> 12:29.280]  enemies list but somebody's got to have courage and somebody's got to analyze
[12:29.280 --> 12:36.120]  their attack profile okay their battle plans for us are stated and I've watched
[12:36.120 --> 12:41.360]  their previous battle plans globalist statements be carried out to the letter
[12:41.360 --> 12:47.000]  we know to the letter what they're going to do and we've had success holding a
[12:47.000 --> 12:52.360]  lot of it back I'm getting chills right now I can't believe it's this corrupt
[12:52.360 --> 13:02.280]  it's this bad the White House announced massive closures energy secretary I
[13:02.280 --> 13:08.320]  mean that but then they put out a press release saying we're liars when we said
[13:08.320 --> 13:11.640]  the exact same thing they've already shut a bunch down the last two years now
[13:11.640 --> 13:16.920]  they're getting massive shutdowns energy prices are skyrocketing not just
[13:16.920 --> 13:20.840]  because of dollar devaluation but because we don't have the power plants we
[13:20.840 --> 13:25.840]  need and now they're getting us ready for blackouts you know the same thing
[13:25.840 --> 13:33.880]  happened back in 99 2000 2001 and it later came out in federal and state
[13:33.880 --> 13:40.360]  court you pull it up in the LA Times in Ron stage blackouts in the West that
[13:40.360 --> 13:43.560]  that should get it for you if you want to read it we covered it here at the time
[13:43.560 --> 13:48.400]  was big news and their internal memos that came out in court said well people
[13:48.400 --> 13:52.680]  don't like to pay more for energy but if we stage a lot of blackouts then that
[13:52.680 --> 13:58.840]  creates the perception of power shortages and then we can double triple
[13:58.840 --> 14:03.480]  charge I mean some days in California alone in Ron was making two three billion
[14:03.480 --> 14:09.360]  dollars extra just off jacking up prices saying well your per kilowatt you know
[14:09.360 --> 14:17.120]  hour has now gone way up and in Ron of course was a drug running money laundering
[14:17.120 --> 14:22.640]  offshore shell corporation no one can deny that now you know back then it was
[14:22.640 --> 14:28.080]  the the smartest guys in the room all hail them they're great so I've been
[14:28.080 --> 14:32.000]  studying this energy situation since then and how it ties into the carbon tax
[14:32.000 --> 14:37.640]  movement who wrote the original carbon tax plan in 1995 who had scores of
[14:37.640 --> 14:42.040]  meetings at the White House headed up by Al Gore as the point man Bill Clinton
[14:42.040 --> 14:49.840]  attending in Ron in Ron with Dutch Royal Shell and BP had meetings and this is
[14:49.840 --> 14:57.040]  Ken lay and it can lay reportedly died two days before he was supposed to show
[14:57.040 --> 15:05.000]  up for his imprisonment you believe that I got a bridge I'll sell you but
[15:05.000 --> 15:14.560]  voila Ken lay a decade after his scams were exposed is still visiting Roth
[15:14.560 --> 15:22.480]  upon us and I'm gonna be going over all of that today I mean that that's that's
[15:22.480 --> 15:28.400]  just off the chart I could spend three hours on that this other issue is
[15:28.400 --> 15:34.280]  frankly even bigger and it ties together with Janet de Paul Otano saying
[15:34.280 --> 15:37.800]  we're under the greatest threats it's 9-11 and she said and we're all a
[15:37.800 --> 15:42.160]  lucky is about to hit us and hit as hard he is now the new bin Laden now I've
[15:42.160 --> 15:45.560]  seen them over the years getting him ready for that he was number three in
[15:45.560 --> 15:51.760]  al-Qaeda on 9-11 he was most wanted he was all over the news and he was
[15:51.760 --> 15:56.280]  secretly at the Pentagon running the entire operation Fox News associated
[15:56.280 --> 15:59.800]  press that came out in October last year no one denies it of course we told
[15:59.800 --> 16:03.720]  you six years ago we proven by then that he was a globalist operative and what
[16:03.720 --> 16:08.760]  he does is he either connects via phone or cell phone to Patsy's through Mosque
[16:08.760 --> 16:15.640]  in the US and then the globalist stage an attack and then and then just arrest
[16:15.640 --> 16:21.320]  some moron and and frame them or they go out and they actually sometimes for
[16:21.320 --> 16:25.160]  years it took him two years to get Hassan ready and the government's
[16:25.160 --> 16:28.640]  tracking all the emails everything he thinks he's emailing a lock he's really
[16:28.640 --> 16:32.280]  that's just a cutout name for when he's talking to the CIA and the Pentagon and
[16:32.280 --> 16:35.560]  then they have everybody stand down and have a drill that day and confiscate
[16:35.560 --> 16:38.920]  the cell phone cameras and won't release the information was totally staged
[16:38.920 --> 16:42.520]  the intel we've got from sources on hood and this actually came out some of the
[16:42.520 --> 16:48.080]  news what the witnesses saw it multiple shooters Hassan probably was you know
[16:48.080 --> 16:53.040]  shot and wounded right at the time with a brain shot and from from past
[16:53.040 --> 16:56.880]  operations you know they have the Patsy ready boom they shoot him then they go
[16:56.880 --> 17:00.400]  ahead and start shooting everybody else with a look alike and it's just how
[17:00.400 --> 17:04.280]  they and that's all in operation Northwood's how to stage these things
[17:04.280 --> 17:08.520]  how to shoot people in Miami DC Maryland and then blame it on the
[17:08.520 --> 17:13.280]  communist and then how to frame Patsy's it's and they've just moved from saying
[17:13.280 --> 17:19.680]  communist now they've moved over to and more all a lockie and the Arabs and then
[17:19.680 --> 17:23.000]  it comes out in the news that the Muslim Brotherhood is run by US
[17:23.000 --> 17:27.600]  intelligence US intelligence is implementing the takeover of Egypt
[17:27.600 --> 17:32.000]  that doesn't mean that people don't have a right to revolt the issue is though it
[17:32.000 --> 17:35.160]  was triggered by the globalist they created the economic atmosphere they
[17:35.160 --> 17:39.560]  boosted the food prices via IMF World Bank orders and then once the atmosphere
[17:39.560 --> 17:42.560]  and the climate was correct they triggered the revolution that was ripe
[17:42.560 --> 17:45.680]  now they'll put their people in and they're saying Mubarak now may not
[17:45.680 --> 17:47.560]  stay till September he could step down any day
[17:47.560 --> 17:51.760]  hazy Mubarak may step down ruling party official suggest president Mubarak may
[17:51.760 --> 17:58.880]  meet protesters demands as army monitor situation so that's what's happening on
[17:58.880 --> 18:04.360]  that front but as soon as I heard that they hadn't passed the Patriot Act Tuesday
[18:04.360 --> 18:09.320]  I got on air yesterday and I said get ready for absolute total fair monitoring
[18:09.320 --> 18:13.080]  that terrorist are about to hit us and then at the time I was talking she was
[18:13.080 --> 18:18.520]  giving a speech before Congress before the Terrorism Committee saying and we're
[18:18.520 --> 18:21.720]  all lockies here he's got domestic people everywhere it's homegrown
[18:21.720 --> 18:26.000]  terrorist we're on full alert they're about to hit and hit hard and now they're
[18:26.000 --> 18:29.480]  rolling him out as the new bin Laden just like they did months before 9-11
[18:29.480 --> 18:33.880]  showing everybody bin Laden saying he's gonna get you when he gets you when he
[18:33.880 --> 18:37.560]  attacks you give all your rights up big mommy government big daddy government
[18:37.560 --> 18:42.040]  big brother government is gonna you know give baby a little sugar lollipop to to

[18:50.400 --> 18:55.800]  will be fine and that's why we keep hammering the point that Amar al-Laki is
[18:55.800 --> 19:00.320]  admittedly run out of the Pentagon and this is a big issue so I call the
[19:00.320 --> 19:05.200]  newspapers about it I call Homeland Security and I say look here's Fox news
[19:05.200 --> 19:09.920]  here's AP here's here's news by Amar al-Laki Pentagon documents leaked the
[19:09.920 --> 19:13.960]  Pentagon doesn't deny it this guy supposedly ran 9-11 with bin Laden
[19:13.960 --> 19:18.560]  he's running all these other attacks and the we know the government helped get
[19:18.560 --> 19:21.560]  the underwear bomber on the plane and protected him that's now confirmed
[19:21.560 --> 19:25.800]  State Department admits it this is all confirmed and you're running these attacks
[19:25.800 --> 19:29.320]  and I don't think the low-level people are obviously they're compartmentalized
[19:29.320 --> 19:35.840]  and I'm there reporting it and they just say sorry you can't report that so
[19:35.840 --> 19:42.560]  there you go and it's a bridge too far for so many people that know 9-11's an
[19:42.560 --> 19:46.200]  inside job to come out admit the truth and so they're getting ready to stage a

[24:09.040 --> 24:14.080]  there's no question that we have made many important strides in securing our
[24:14.080 --> 24:20.120]  country from terrorism since 9-11 but the threat continues to evolve and in
[24:20.120 --> 24:25.240]  some ways the threat today may be at its most heightened state since the attacks
[24:25.240 --> 24:30.440]  nearly 10 years ago in addition to the core al-qaeda group which still
[24:30.440 --> 24:35.440]  represents a threat to the United States despite its diminished capabilities we
[24:35.440 --> 24:40.040]  now face threats from a number of al-qaeda associates that share its violent
[24:40.040 --> 24:46.040]  extremist ideology among these groups we are also seeing an increased emphasis
[24:46.040 --> 24:50.960]  on recruiting Americans and Westerners to carry out attacks these groups are
[24:50.960 --> 24:54.840]  trying to recruit people to carry out attacks they have connections to the
[24:54.840 --> 24:59.800]  West but who do not have strong ties to terrorist groups that could possibly
[24:59.800 --> 25:05.040]  tip off the intelligence community they are also encouraging individuals in the
[25:05.040 --> 25:09.640]  West to carry out their own small-scale attacks which require less of the
[25:09.640 --> 25:13.960]  coordination and planning that could raise red flags and lead to an attacks
[25:13.960 --> 25:19.400]  disruption and then she went on and CBS News is reporting to say that Amaral
[25:19.400 --> 25:25.480]  Alaki has now replaced bin Laden who he knows been dead for nine years as the new
[25:25.480 --> 25:33.160]  commander of al-qaeda and hiding in plain view he admittedly is working with the
[25:33.160 --> 25:38.200]  Pentagon secretly and running these patsies in every case whether it's the
[25:38.200 --> 25:44.680]  underwear bomber the shoe bomber the Fort Hood situation the Times Square
[25:44.680 --> 25:49.920]  situation these people think they're talking to Amaral Alaki and really
[25:49.920 --> 25:55.080]  they're being handled and supported and armed and then when there are other
[25:55.080 --> 25:58.320]  agencies or sections of agencies that find out what's happening and try to
[25:58.320 --> 26:01.920]  frustrate it they're blocked from stopping it when they're mentally
[26:01.920 --> 26:06.160]  retarded in the case of Mutala that's clear disheveled look drugged according
[26:06.160 --> 26:11.800]  to witnesses didn't have a passport he didn't he couldn't get his visa so an
[26:11.800 --> 26:14.600]  unnamed US agency told the State Department the State Department put a
[26:14.600 --> 26:16.960]  press release out on this they said we're not going to get burned for this
[26:16.960 --> 26:21.960]  the undersecretary Kennedy came out and said look I was told by an unnamed US
[26:21.960 --> 26:26.920]  agency to give him the visa but then he didn't have the passport so a American
[26:26.920 --> 26:31.160]  you know accented sharp-dressed man argued with the gate people got him
[26:31.160 --> 26:34.760]  through security and on the airplane we told you that two months before the
[26:34.760 --> 26:38.280]  State Department came out and confirmed it was true because we have the eyewitnesses
[26:38.280 --> 26:43.360]  the Haskells and others I mean do you understand how dangerous this is you
[26:43.360 --> 26:47.440]  got a locky who they say is gonna hit us and hit us hard you got all these
[26:47.440 --> 26:51.320]  Democratic memos saying we need a big terror attacks people love Obama again
[26:51.320 --> 26:55.640]  that will save us just like Oklahoma City did they are one inch from admitting
[26:55.640 --> 26:58.680]  they did it all they're just out in the open like we're idiots and don't see what
[26:58.680 --> 27:02.400]  they're doing even Glenn Beck came out last year we've played the clip and said
[27:02.400 --> 27:06.160]  the government's getting ready to stage a new Oklahoma City and blame it on him
[27:06.160 --> 27:10.920]  and when he says him he means what's known as the Patriot movement that Glenn
[27:10.920 --> 27:15.200]  Beck has seen as one of the leaders of probably the biggest you know person out
[27:15.200 --> 27:21.320]  there after Ron Paul and then myself but he's a doppelganger he's a wicked clone
[27:21.320 --> 27:29.280]  who show he's kind of a bizarro you know the the twisted version of Superman
[27:29.280 --> 27:33.360]  I have to sit here and watch this Michael Savage is saying they're getting
[27:33.360 --> 27:37.160]  ready to stage terror attacks because they telegraph it you have to read all
[27:37.160 --> 27:40.480]  the White House advisor quotes about if we don't have a new Oklahoma City or
[27:40.480 --> 27:44.000]  9-11 we're not gonna get our agenda through we need an event so Obama can be
[27:44.000 --> 27:48.840]  our leader and you saw him seize on the Tucson hoax and blame it on talk radio
[27:48.840 --> 27:52.440]  and everybody and say shut up and do what I say and you got a 15-point boost
[27:52.440 --> 27:56.760]  in that though it's already gone away they need a big terror attack and right
[27:56.760 --> 28:01.280]  on time when they didn't pass the Patriot Act a lock he's gonna hit us it's
[28:01.280 --> 28:10.080]  the biggest threat ever oh and we're like a lock he works for you and then
[28:10.080 --> 28:14.640]  and then here's the Associated Press today man says ex CIA agent Posada gave
[28:14.640 --> 28:18.280]  him explosives for hotel bombing well that's already come out congressional
[28:18.280 --> 28:24.240]  hearings years ago this guy under CIA orders he's basically been pardoned by
[28:24.240 --> 28:29.640]  the bureaucracy and let out of a u.s. prison blow up an Olympic team on an
[28:29.640 --> 28:33.800]  airplane and he's admittedly CIA and when they would do these bombings they
[28:33.800 --> 28:39.000]  blame it on other people that's what the globalists do in an exclusive interview
[28:39.000 --> 28:43.000]  Tuesday a Salvadoran man told the Associated Press at former CIA operative
[28:43.000 --> 28:47.240]  gave him powerful explosives and cash to carry out a 97 hotel bombing in Cuba
[28:47.240 --> 28:53.160]  Otto Renee Rodriguez so that he was given C4 explosives and $2,000 by
[28:53.160 --> 29:00.000]  Louis Posada Carilias to enable the bombing of a Havana Havana's Mela
[29:00.000 --> 29:06.240]  Cohiba hotel on August 3rd 97 he was later captured in Cuba with 3.3 pounds
[29:06.240 --> 29:11.400]  of C4 that he had been given by Posada and it just goes on from there but he's
[29:11.400 --> 29:15.320]  been caught and it's been confirmed running a bunch of other attacks I mean
[29:15.320 --> 29:21.320]  it's just like it's just like and we're all a lucky and we've got Newsweek
[29:21.320 --> 29:27.320]  San Jose Mercury news with the reported hijackers trained at us basis and it's
[29:27.320 --> 29:30.520]  like well they were but let's not talk about it oh they did have us government
[29:30.520 --> 29:34.400]  credit cards let's not talk about it okay the US Embassy in Saudi Arabia was
[29:34.400 --> 29:37.400]  ordered to let them into the country when they were flagged as terrorists but
[29:37.400 --> 29:40.840]  let's not talk about it oh and what did the CIA tell the State Department to let
[29:40.840 --> 29:45.960]  them in back in 2000 before the attack early 2001 they said don't worry they're
[29:45.960 --> 29:51.360]  not really terrorists they work for us I mean we got them right there we're on
[29:51.360 --> 29:59.400]  the March the Empire's on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[33:02.280 --> 33:07.600]  information war it's Alex Jones
[33:07.600 --> 33:29.480]  the power plants being shut down and triggering the lack of power we need
[33:29.480 --> 33:33.040]  we've been proven completely correct I'm gonna be going over that on the fact
[33:33.040 --> 33:38.600]  that you cannot call and get anybody to report suspicious activity or who's
[33:38.600 --> 33:43.200]  involved in the terrorism we've proven that it's all a hoax just like they
[33:43.200 --> 33:46.920]  turned off the naked body scanners the day before Thanksgiving Thanksgiving and
[33:46.920 --> 33:51.000]  for several days after so that we couldn't protest showing that there's no
[33:51.000 --> 33:54.920]  real threat they're not really trying to protect you it's all political training
[33:54.920 --> 33:59.680]  you to be a prisoner to line up and have the government frisk you to have
[33:59.680 --> 34:03.920]  federally funded checkpoints roll out across the country as it's now
[34:03.920 --> 34:11.760]  happening and it is just so incredible to now have the government come out right
[34:11.760 --> 34:16.000]  after the Patriot Act doesn't get repass reauthorized it's been Bob Barr put
[34:16.000 --> 34:19.440]  the provision in in 2001 to have it sunset it every few years they have to
[34:19.440 --> 34:24.000]  keep reauthorizing it and we said watch they're gonna run out and say al-qaeda
[34:24.000 --> 34:27.200]  is about to hit they're gonna say and we're all lucky and that's what they
[34:27.200 --> 34:31.760]  did and we're just supposed to sit here like we're all morons like we're
[34:31.760 --> 34:36.080]  idiots and go along with it listen to this feds Times Square mastermind
[34:36.080 --> 34:40.200]  Times Square mastermind bigger threat than bin Laden the Palatano says
[34:40.200 --> 34:46.040]  American board al-a-Laki a serious concern see we're talking about a lock
[34:46.040 --> 34:49.760]  years ago when it wasn't cool when nobody knew who he was we know who he is
[34:49.760 --> 34:55.000]  he's the new bin Laden and he works for them a terror power shift leads to a
[34:55.000 --> 34:58.480]  stunning warning from the Department of Homeland Security the American born
[34:58.480 --> 35:02.680]  cleric behind the attempted Times Square bombing and all those others they
[35:02.680 --> 35:06.160]  don't tell you that has now a clips bin Laden and is the biggest threat to
[35:06.160 --> 35:13.960]  American Security report CBS news and it goes on to break down that and we're
[35:13.960 --> 35:17.320]  all a lock he is now the boss of all bosses of the group of al-qaeda in the
[35:17.320 --> 35:22.000]  Arabian Peninsula the Fed said Wednesday he is now the number one threat the most
[35:22.000 --> 35:25.160]  significant risk the United States National Counterterrorism Center
[35:25.160 --> 35:30.280]  director Michael Leiter told the House Homeland Security Committee that
[35:30.280 --> 35:35.160]  American war on bin Laden has allowed others to come to the forefront oh it's
[35:35.160 --> 35:40.720]  a shadowy enemy this former CIA guy who's admittedly former CIA bin Laden
[35:40.720 --> 35:45.680]  he's now faded off but let's let's nobody's buying that anymore nobody's
[35:45.680 --> 35:49.400]  seen him you know in on a new video for nine years the government's been caught
[35:49.400 --> 35:52.840]  producing fake ones and admitting it later that was admitted the Washington
[35:52.840 --> 35:56.560]  Post last year we already knew it but they just admit it all like we're
[35:56.560 --> 36:00.800]  stupid like we're not paying attention because they know the fetish they've
[36:00.800 --> 36:05.120]  created of getting into fearing Muslims all day and I'm not saying there aren't
[36:05.120 --> 36:08.760]  radical Muslims I'm not saying that there aren't people who want a new
[36:08.760 --> 36:14.320]  Ottoman Empire that they've been you know talking so much about but I mean
[36:14.320 --> 36:19.440]  every big block of people wants to rule the world okay the issue here is that
[36:19.440 --> 36:23.280]  the globalist are running and financing the radical Muslims so that they can
[36:23.280 --> 36:26.960]  take our liberties away domestically and bomb those countries into the stone
[36:26.960 --> 36:31.280]  age and because the radical Muslims will keep their countries in the stone age
[36:31.280 --> 36:37.720]  that's the globalist program the strategy of tension now I got a lot of
[36:37.720 --> 36:41.920]  other news we've warned you for years about the dangers of diet soft drinks
[36:41.920 --> 36:46.360]  that have the genetically engineered E. Coli excrement in it that's what
[36:46.360 --> 36:49.440]  aspartame is if you don't believe me just search the term aspartame
[36:49.440 --> 36:53.400]  manufacturing process it's a genetically engineered E. Coli that they
[36:53.400 --> 36:59.200]  feed toxic waste to that then excretes out the toxin and it's very addicting
[36:59.200 --> 37:04.640]  it is a neurotoxin but here it is this is out of AFP strokes up among younger
[37:04.640 --> 37:09.200]  US population you know so suddenly we're getting 25 year olds getting
[37:09.200 --> 37:14.160]  Alzheimer's and here's ABC news diet soda fewer calories greater stroke risk
[37:14.160 --> 37:18.120]  controversial study linking diet soda to height than stroke risk draws
[37:18.120 --> 37:22.760]  skepticism oh yeah we've just had scientists and brain surgeons on for
[37:22.760 --> 37:27.280]  years telling you the same thing but oh we don't know why the strokes are way
[37:27.280 --> 37:30.360]  up we don't know why all these disorders are way up we're gonna be getting into
[37:30.360 --> 37:38.120]  that as well but I wanted for the next 10 minutes to play the first 10 minutes
[37:38.120 --> 37:43.480]  of fall the Republic I think it's a more important film better done more
[37:43.480 --> 37:48.200]  information than the Obama deception but it's probably only been seen 15 million
[37:48.200 --> 37:51.840]  times for free online instead of 30 plus million times online for free like
[37:51.840 --> 37:56.040]  Obama deception and it's up on YouTube you can just search fall the Republic
[37:56.040 --> 38:00.080]  you get a high quality DVD from us and purchase it and make copies and give it
[38:00.080 --> 38:02.880]  to everybody you know we have it very inexpensive where you can buy them in
[38:02.880 --> 38:06.640]  bulk for like 4.95 a piece with the high quality shrink wrap in the color
[38:06.640 --> 38:10.360]  cover and the expanded extras so people are more apt to watch it when you give
[38:10.360 --> 38:14.600]  it to them if you want to support us but I don't care the bottom line is get it
[38:14.600 --> 38:20.400]  out to everybody because the first 10 minutes of the film now made a year and
[38:20.400 --> 38:26.400]  a half ago breaks down everything the globalist are now doing we told you what
[38:26.400 --> 38:29.800]  they do and it's evergreen that's what my that's why my films are so important
[38:29.800 --> 38:34.600]  they get better with time like fine wine because we know what's happening we
[38:34.600 --> 38:38.760]  we've got the number of the globalist we've got their pulse we've got their
[38:38.760 --> 38:46.400]  MO we understand their program and by getting the word out on what they're
[38:46.400 --> 38:51.120]  doing we can stop them you think they're gonna be able to just shut off massive
[38:51.120 --> 38:57.160]  amounts of us power plants if we speak out and point out what they're doing and
[38:57.160 --> 39:00.080]  then it's a shut down their competition nothing to do with saving the earth from
[39:00.080 --> 39:04.320]  carbon dioxide do you think they're gonna be able to get away with setting up
[39:04.320 --> 39:08.520]  domestic checkpoints if we illustrate that the terror is a fraud you have the
[39:08.520 --> 39:11.720]  internal homeland security mic reports that law enforcement sent us and that
[39:11.720 --> 39:17.040]  have been confirmed to be real none of it has to do with the central asian
[39:17.040 --> 39:22.600]  cave dwellers it's all about gun owners land rights groups anti-fellow reserve
[39:22.600 --> 39:27.480]  groups libertarians Ron Paul supporters Bob Barr supporters Alex Jones
[39:27.480 --> 39:32.000]  supporters it's all about real Americans who aren't in a trance who are awake and
[39:32.000 --> 39:36.720]  see what's going on we've got to wake the other mind-numbed zombies out of
[39:36.720 --> 39:40.360]  their slumber we've got to do it now but we've already got sufficient numbers
[39:40.360 --> 39:44.320]  that if all of you take action and get the word out and expose the globalists
[39:44.320 --> 39:48.320]  in the V for victory campaign and we continue to push we're gonna win this
[39:48.320 --> 39:52.920]  thing if not they've got hardcore systematic scientific tyranny lined up
[39:52.920 --> 39:56.160]  for us so I want to get into the power plant situation we come back from break
[39:56.160 --> 40:04.760]  I want to get into the fact that it has been proven to be a manifest hoax and a
[40:04.760 --> 40:09.600]  fraud I'm looking for Paul Joseph Watson's article I printed in here to
[40:09.600 --> 40:16.360]  cover here it is see something say something expose as a hoax that's Paul
[40:16.360 --> 40:20.040]  Watson's article on it and has the video posted the compilation we put
[40:20.040 --> 40:23.680]  together of our calls Sunday and yesterday live on air at a homeland
[40:23.680 --> 40:29.400]  security FBI you name it we then also have Kurt Nemo's excellent article that
[40:29.400 --> 40:33.360]  covers other angles Alex Jones exposes see something say something as patent
[40:33.360 --> 40:40.120]  fraud that special video report is up on prisonplanet.com and infowars.com
[40:40.120 --> 40:44.800]  it's a 24-minute report that you need to get out to everybody you know so they
[40:44.800 --> 40:47.920]  get the full spectrum understanding of how you try to report terror and you
[40:47.920 --> 40:54.480]  can't because this is a non-existent made up synthetic manufactured system I'm
[40:54.480 --> 41:00.720]  actually pulling it up here so you can get the actual headline video Alex Jones
[41:00.720 --> 41:04.960]  exposes DHS terror fraud get that out to everybody but let's go to about nine
[41:04.960 --> 41:09.280]  minutes as we go to break from the intro through the first nine minutes of my
[41:09.280 --> 41:15.220]  seminal film fall of the Republic you just type that into a search engine the
[41:15.220 --> 41:20.520]  video is the number one link you know it's not Gibbons rising the climb of the
[41:20.520 --> 41:26.040]  Roman Empire or a rise and fall the Third Reich or or or the the Star Wars book
[41:26.040 --> 41:30.120]  fall the Republic it is our film fall the Republic let's go ahead and play this
[41:30.120 --> 41:32.760]  important video
[41:38.600 --> 41:43.720]  last week the head of the country's central bank floated the idea of dumping
[41:43.720 --> 41:48.080]  the greenback as the world's reserve currency replacing it with an
[41:48.080 --> 41:52.680]  international currency thousands of people gathered to hear Barack Obama
[41:52.680 --> 41:57.960]  deliver key foreign policy speech on his current European tour his vision for
[41:57.960 --> 42:03.520]  America's place in a new world order returning vets could be a risk to our
[42:03.520 --> 42:09.960]  nation we've got to give them a stake in creating the kind of world order that I
[42:09.960 --> 42:13.800]  think all of us would like to see and one of the ways it will drive the changes
[42:13.800 --> 42:18.840]  through global governance I think the new world order is emerging this is a
[42:18.840 --> 42:24.200]  hoax and a scam which is designed to transfer wealth and power from the
[42:24.200 --> 42:27.560]  private sector to the government sector and from the government of the United
[42:27.560 --> 42:32.640]  States to a world government and those people who have been yelling oh the UN's
[42:32.640 --> 42:36.560]  gonna take over global it's mercy they're concerned they've been crazy but
[42:36.560 --> 42:41.560]  now they're right and who got the money hundreds and hundreds of banks any bank
[42:41.560 --> 42:47.680]  or that has access to the US Federal Reserve system tell us who they are no
[42:47.680 --> 42:51.040]  you know financial terrorism they have the ability to tweak the knob I am
[42:51.040 --> 42:56.000]  proposing that the Federal Reserve be granted new authority the ultimate goal
[42:56.000 --> 43:02.120]  of the carbon tax and the cap and trade is to destroy production this energy
[43:02.120 --> 43:07.360]  taxes the largest tax increase in American history we're actually creating a
[43:07.360 --> 43:10.760]  global warming police so number one they can come in the federal government can
[43:10.760 --> 43:15.320]  come in and inspect your house and send you the bill we're setting up a global
[43:15.320 --> 43:20.600]  warming Gestapo one of the things that if you talk to our generals they are
[43:20.600 --> 43:30.440]  desperate for is a civilian counterpart to our military forces I am fierce
[43:30.440 --> 43:37.240]  in this is what I wear Senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign is
[43:37.240 --> 43:41.880]  asking Missouri law enforcement to target anyone who lives or runs the
[43:41.880 --> 43:48.560]  misleading television ad I've now been in 57 states I think one left to go the
[43:48.560 --> 43:52.400]  president when he was in Europe last week he met with the king of Saudi Arabia
[43:52.400 --> 43:57.760]  he appeared to Bob President Obama today proposed something new something called
[43:57.760 --> 44:02.800]  prolonged detention pre-crime is where people are arrested and incarcerated to
[44:02.800 --> 44:07.560]  prevent crimes that they have not yet committed
[44:21.440 --> 44:27.200]  it's the world wrestling Federation it's the Washington wrestling Federation
[44:27.200 --> 44:32.600]  they put on this show that they're bitter rivalries you know villains and they
[44:32.600 --> 44:37.240]  really don't like each other but behind closed doors they buddy up for a drink
[44:37.240 --> 44:43.440]  and make deals both the Republican and Democratic parties are owned by the same
[44:43.440 --> 44:51.800]  global elites and on issues that matter to those global elites they act as one
[44:51.800 --> 44:56.200]  they've wrapped themselves in the American flag and they've talked about
[44:56.200 --> 45:01.600]  preserving American heritage and principles and all the while they're
[45:01.600 --> 45:05.680]  working to merge us into a new world order where our sovereignty will be
[45:05.680 --> 45:11.560]  destroyed we'll lose all connection with our American heritage with Bush you do
[45:11.560 --> 45:17.960]  exactly what you were getting it was there was no iron fist in in a velvet
[45:17.960 --> 45:22.080]  glove it was just the iron fist whereas with Obama you've got the velvet glove
[45:22.080 --> 45:26.480]  and the iron fist you know a very sharp guy very smooth knows exactly what he's
[45:26.480 --> 45:33.240]  doing for that reason far more dangerous than Bush well at the end of last year I
[45:33.240 --> 45:38.360]  was willing to give Obama the benefit of the doubt I thought it was premature to
[45:38.360 --> 45:42.440]  write this guy off but now that he's been in office for a while it's obvious
[45:42.440 --> 45:47.640]  that he is very tight with the Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan's on Wall Street and
[45:47.640 --> 45:55.360]  he is extremely compliant and pliant to the wishes of the large banks going
[45:55.360 --> 45:59.760]  back to the what we saw with Robert Rubin under the Clinton administration
[45:59.760 --> 46:03.920]  changing laws in favor of the banks and he's not doing anything to stop the
[46:03.920 --> 46:07.960]  banks he's helping the banks continue to do what they were doing under Bush so in
[46:07.960 --> 46:12.120]  fact he's just a continuation of Bush on the subject of markets and finance which
[46:12.120 --> 46:17.600]  is the most important part of his policy right now people voted for Obama won a
[46:17.600 --> 46:21.240]  real change and they're getting platitudes are getting a lot of nice
[46:21.240 --> 46:26.320]  talk but nothing in the way of concrete change is taking place in this town
[46:26.320 --> 46:32.160]  business as usual there's one puppet master that controls the left and there's
[46:32.160 --> 46:37.520]  a not the same puppet master controls the right they control the Republican
[46:37.520 --> 46:46.040]  Party and they control the Democratic Party this is not a party issue this is
[46:46.040 --> 46:54.360]  not a left-right issue the question is who should government serve and it should
[46:54.360 --> 46:58.800]  serve the people in fact government is just a tool of government minority that
[46:58.800 --> 47:02.680]  uses economics and government law to enforce upon the public various
[47:02.680 --> 47:09.440]  mandates the right left paradigm in the US and in US politics is taken directly
[47:09.440 --> 47:13.440]  from the commercial world and the corporate world in the business world
[47:13.440 --> 47:18.720]  you have coke Pepsi you have McDonald's Burger King you've got 1818 Verizon you
[47:18.720 --> 47:24.040]  know you've got duopoly's and a duopoly gives the illusion of there being some
[47:24.040 --> 47:29.360]  competition and some choice and it looks a little bit better than a monopoly so
[47:29.360 --> 47:33.560]  for example in communist Russia if they had communist Russia red and communist
[47:33.560 --> 47:40.360]  Russia chartreuse there would have been the illusion of choice and something
[47:40.360 --> 47:44.120]  akin to democracy in Russia but they simply said forget it we're just gonna
[47:44.120 --> 47:50.800]  go with red in the US they have this ref left-right paradigm which unfortunately
[47:50.800 --> 47:56.240]  it doesn't take them out of the the hard-cold fact that there is no choice
[47:56.240 --> 48:01.680]  there's no social justice there's only one choice which is to supply more rent
[48:01.680 --> 48:06.800]  to the rent seekers who have now taken the whole system hostage we've seen the
[48:06.800 --> 48:12.400]  limitations on government whittled away we have seen this erosion to the point
[48:12.400 --> 48:17.560]  where today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have
[48:17.560 --> 48:22.680]  seen a fall of the Republic if the United States doesn't have its Bill of
[48:22.680 --> 48:26.880]  Rights and Constitution it doesn't exist anymore it's just more real estate more
[48:26.880 --> 48:31.560]  dirt and that's what these global corporates want they want to completely
[48:31.560 --> 48:34.160]  dismantle the Bill of Rights and Constitution and they're doing that
[48:34.160 --> 48:40.480]  right now this is the fall of the Republic our nation is dying we the
[48:40.480 --> 48:45.760]  people that live in this fine country need to stand up get involved and take
[48:45.760 --> 48:49.920]  the system back it's the Bill of Rights and Constitution that we owe
[48:49.920 --> 48:54.800]  allegiance to not to a political party and not to politicians that wrap
[48:54.800 --> 48:59.400]  themselves in the red white and blue all at the same time they destroy
[48:59.400 --> 49:04.040]  everything that that sacred flag stands for so in the old days used to have
[49:04.040 --> 49:08.840]  this globe that with 180 some odd countries and a few of those countries
[49:08.840 --> 49:13.640]  had a lot of power like the Soviet Union the United Kingdom and the United
[49:13.640 --> 49:18.920]  States at various times but today you might better look at that globe and say
[49:18.920 --> 49:23.800]  that it's surrounded by huge clouds swirling around the planet they know
[49:23.800 --> 49:28.960]  no national boundaries they don't follow any specific sets of laws and these are
[49:28.960 --> 49:32.880]  the big corporations they basically control politicians around the world
[49:32.880 --> 49:35.920]  because they have all the money and politicians always need money to get
[49:35.920 --> 49:39.920]  elected or to run their governments if they're if they're not democratically
[49:39.920 --> 49:43.560]  elected politicians they control the mainstream press either throughout
[49:43.560 --> 49:48.120]  right ownership or advertising budgets they have massive amounts of lobbyists
[49:48.120 --> 49:53.040]  in Washington that have tremendous influence on our president and Congress
[49:53.040 --> 49:58.440]  and they really are calling the shots they form partnerships with the Chinese
[49:58.440 --> 50:04.320]  and the Taiwanese and the Tibetans or with the Israelis and Arab nations with
[50:04.320 --> 50:09.560]  Brazilians and Indians with whatever country and whatever group of people has
[50:09.560 --> 50:13.880]  resources that they covet and they so for the first time in history we really
[50:13.880 --> 50:21.080]  have this new form of an empire Barack Obama is a puppet of the New World Order
[50:21.080 --> 50:28.200]  to bring in a World Bank to destroy the economy of this country and to bring in
[50:28.200 --> 50:34.000]  global governance and no matter how lifeable the fellow is we as citizens
[50:34.000 --> 50:39.080]  of this country need to stand up and say no all right folks we're gonna be back
[50:39.080 --> 50:44.280]  on the other side and break down a key strategic attack system but the globalist
[50:44.280 --> 50:48.560]  of launch not just here but worldwide the takeover of our energy systems the
[50:48.560 --> 50:52.840]  White House responded to prison wanted comm last Friday and we know why they've
[50:52.840 --> 50:56.560]  been caught with their pants down and if we expose what they're doing they will
[50:56.560 --> 50:58.760]  fail
[51:00.520 --> 51:04.240]  we all know that Berkey water purification systems are the most

[52:09.440 --> 52:13.240]  finishing off this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the
[52:13.240 --> 52:17.400]  Americans at home. I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in
[52:17.400 --> 52:22.480]  Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of
[52:22.480 --> 52:27.520]  us as American citizens to pay attention. Full the Republic identifies the
[52:27.520 --> 52:32.320]  enemies of our nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying
[52:32.320 --> 52:37.040]  sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke,
[52:37.040 --> 52:41.000]  their arsonists they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who
[52:41.000 --> 52:44.840]  do we make the check out to? Today seems like nobody does care and right now in
[52:44.840 --> 52:50.840]  Washington DC we have seen a fall of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the
[52:50.840 --> 52:56.760]  Republic on DVD at info wars.com or watch it online right now in super high

[53:02.400 --> 53:06.200]  global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near
[53:06.200 --> 53:10.040]  the Arctic Circle? Did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could
[53:10.040 --> 53:13.760]  become more valuable than silver or gold? It's true seeds have all performed even
[53:13.760 --> 53:17.040]  gold and silver before in this country and it's possible that could even happen
[53:17.040 --> 53:21.320]  again. So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix
[53:21.320 --> 53:26.520]  of non-hybrid seeds. They call it a survival seed bank and it can produce an
[53:26.520 --> 53:30.760]  endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family and here's the best
[53:30.760 --> 53:34.520]  part. These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way and you
[53:34.520 --> 53:38.640]  actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden so visit them
[53:38.640 --> 53:43.840]  today at survivalseedbank.com. That's survivalseedbank.com or give them a
[53:43.840 --> 53:54.000]  call at 877-327-0365. That's 877-327-0365. Remember in a real crisis
[53:54.000 --> 53:58.120]  non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item. This is Alex Jones for
[53:58.120 --> 54:04.840]  survivalseedbank.com. The Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly
[54:04.840 --> 54:11.920]  presents the Alex Jones show because there's a war on for your mind.
[54:11.920 --> 54:17.200]  Al Jazeera is reporting that Haasie Mubarak may step down in the next few
[54:17.200 --> 54:21.920]  days. He's not gonna try to hold on until September and during the break Fox
[54:21.920 --> 54:27.720]  News is reporting that insiders inside the Mubarak government have told Fox
[54:27.720 --> 54:33.840]  News that he is about to step down and that it is imminent and then now you'll
[54:33.840 --> 54:36.800]  basically have the same dictatorial parliament that he already had in place
[54:36.800 --> 54:41.160]  will still be there still financed by the United States and Israel and others
[54:41.160 --> 54:45.800]  and I guess they're gonna move in albarity that some say is good others
[54:45.800 --> 54:50.400]  say is bad. We know the vice president of Mubarak's the big torture master
[54:50.400 --> 54:56.120]  that's his supposed replacement for other people so a big development on that
[54:56.120 --> 55:02.760]  front. Now this story affects your power prices it affects American companies
[55:02.760 --> 55:07.000]  being able to get inexpensive affordable energy. China again built three to five
[55:07.000 --> 55:10.920]  new power plants a week. We get to build three a year. They've been blocking
[55:10.920 --> 55:14.600]  power plants and shutting them down a lot of the country and here is CBS News
[55:14.600 --> 55:19.160]  today. North Texas could see more rolling blackouts as demand for
[55:19.160 --> 55:23.360]  electricity could reach record high levels this morning and now they are
[55:23.360 --> 55:28.200]  reporting there have been some blackouts. Now dovetail that with Newsmax
[55:28.200 --> 55:33.320]  reporting massive closures that's a quote of U.S. coal plants loom Choo says
[55:33.320 --> 55:37.960]  the U.S. has an aging inventory oh that's aging so they need to shut them
[55:37.960 --> 55:42.560]  down it's government orders of coal fired plants and many units might be
[55:42.560 --> 55:47.080]  closed before the end of the decade energy secretary Stephen Choo said we're
[55:47.080 --> 55:50.280]  going to see massive retirements within the next five eight years yeah
[55:50.280 --> 55:54.560]  under government regulations. Choo said today as the renewable energy conference
[55:54.560 --> 55:58.400]  in Washington much of our fleet of coal plants is 40 to 50 years old the
[55:58.400 --> 56:02.680]  sites are they've been updating them. President Barack Obama said last month
[56:02.680 --> 56:07.280]  the U.S. should eliminate tax subsidies for fossil fuel production worth 4
[56:07.280 --> 56:10.400]  billion a year so it can be spending on renewable energy oh yes that costs 10
[56:10.400 --> 56:15.640]  times more on average and they go on to say that they're going to shut down
[56:15.640 --> 56:19.640]  hundreds of coal powered plants the next five to eight years and they've
[56:19.640 --> 56:22.600]  already been blocking new ones being built blocking already finished high
[56:22.600 --> 56:26.320]  tech ones that nothing comes out but carbon dioxide and water vapor and
[56:26.320 --> 56:29.600]  they're calling that the new pollution and our articles countering the White
[56:29.600 --> 56:34.200]  House lies on Sunday the articles where we counted their lies from Friday where
[56:34.200 --> 56:39.880]  they responded and said oh there's these liars you know saying that we're
[56:39.880 --> 56:46.480]  causing the blackouts but it's cold weather there were 50 plus malfunctions
[56:46.480 --> 56:54.800]  in Texas alone well I happen to have the report here and Paul Watson has links
[56:54.800 --> 57:02.000]  to the government reports White House lies on blackouts exposed I mean it
[57:02.000 --> 57:05.240]  should be White House confirmed White House a great article but it should be
[57:05.240 --> 57:11.480]  White House confirms or or confirmed White House energy policies cause
[57:11.480 --> 57:15.840]  blackouts confirmed White House energy policies cause blackouts and Paul Joseph
[57:15.840 --> 57:21.600]  Watson goes over this White House lies on blackouts exposed and it goes on from
[57:21.600 --> 57:25.800]  there breaking it all down that Obama Communications Director Peter Pfeiffer
[57:25.800 --> 57:29.440]  attacked our article blaming the White House anti-energy policy for
[57:29.440 --> 57:32.640]  contributing to the severity of the rolling blackouts that have occurred over
[57:32.640 --> 57:36.920]  the past few weeks he claimed that the that the outages had nothing to do with
[57:36.920 --> 57:42.640]  maxed out grids and were in fact solely the result of mechanical failures well
[57:42.640 --> 57:46.680]  this formed the foundation of Pfeiffer's charge that our research was
[57:46.680 --> 57:51.800]  unquestionably false quote and was used to dismiss our argument that the
[57:51.800 --> 57:56.280]  Obama Administration's strict enforcement of draconian EPA regulations that has
[57:56.280 --> 58:00.880]  led to the new clean burning coal plants being mothballed and other existing
[58:00.880 --> 58:05.880]  ones being shut down has in turn led to Texas and other states becoming energy
[58:05.880 --> 58:09.560]  dependent leading to shortages and blackouts whether or not the White House
[58:09.560 --> 58:13.440]  lied comes down to whether the severity of the blackouts was made worse by
[58:13.440 --> 58:18.840]  maxed out power grids or mechanical failures the electric reliability
[58:18.840 --> 58:23.080]  council of Texas the agency that oversees the state's power says the energy
[58:23.080 --> 58:29.440]  grid was nearly maxed out WFAATV reports the agency has warned consumers that
[58:29.440 --> 58:33.880]  they could should conserve power and if they don't rolling blackouts will likely
[58:33.880 --> 58:39.240]  happen once again and they go on to say it was not mechanical failures they were
[58:39.240 --> 58:41.520]  maxed out
[58:43.560 --> 58:50.040]  this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network

[59:51.800 --> 01:00:00.640]  waging war on corruption Alex Jones on the GCM radio network
[01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:12.640]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:22.960]  he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:28.240]  okay I want to open the phones up in the next two segments ahead of Max Kaiser
[01:00:28.240 --> 01:00:31.720]  joining us then Stuart Rhodes founder of both keepers joining us in studio in the
[01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:36.760]  third hour but I really want to hear from callers specifically talking about
[01:00:36.760 --> 01:00:39.440]  whatever you want but I'd like to hear your take on it being confirmed that
[01:00:39.440 --> 01:00:44.360]  there weren't mechanical malfunctions at 50 power plants those are just said 50
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:50.280]  just made up a round number that that it was the lack of building new plants and
[01:00:50.280 --> 01:00:54.520]  the record amount of power being used that caused it and now new ones are
[01:00:54.520 --> 01:00:58.280]  happening today and the energy secretary says get ready for massive closures
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:01.080]  under their new rules they've already been shutting down as many as they can
[01:01:01.080 --> 01:01:06.080]  and so there egg on the face of the White House and drudges reporting the
[01:01:06.080 --> 01:01:11.040]  blackouts again I've been attacked by the White House I think it's important
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:16.160]  for everybody to get these article that Watson did White House lies on blackouts
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:19.920]  exposed that's a great article by Watson but I think the headline I'm gonna try
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:23.320]  just try to get a hold of Watson should be changed at least on Info Wars since
[01:01:23.320 --> 01:01:31.800]  Kurt's here I'm gonna hold him he's in office Watson's over in England that and
[01:01:31.800 --> 01:01:35.080]  I mean the headline should be confirmed White House policies contributed to
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:41.760]  blackouts I mean it's a fact you got the head of the energy department running
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:46.080]  around saying they're gonna shut down massive amounts of these I mean it's
[01:01:46.080 --> 01:01:50.000]  incredible what's happening in plain view they're attacking our energy
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.640]  infrastructure I'd like to get your take on that or the see something say
[01:01:53.640 --> 01:01:59.560]  something exposed as a hoax we can't get a terror threat and and and evidence of
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:05.720]  who we know it is working for the Pentagon and we're all walking they won't
[01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:09.760]  take our complaints but you can't even get them on the phone you can't even get
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:13.520]  people on the phone before they've heard what we say many times showing that
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:16.840]  this threat so imminent why aren't they answering the phone threats so imminent
[01:02:16.840 --> 01:02:21.240]  why did they turn off the naked body scanners during the four or five day
[01:02:21.240 --> 01:02:26.080]  period in and around Thanksgiving knowing we were gonna be protesting they
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:30.360]  wanted that story to go away and to kill it they failed but that's happening and
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:34.640]  now on the heels of the Patriot Act not being reauthorized the Homeland
[01:02:34.640 --> 01:02:37.480]  Security runs in before Congress and says and we're all the lock he's now the
[01:02:37.480 --> 01:02:41.280]  leader of Al Qaeda he's about to hit us and we're like well here's Fox News and
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:45.600]  AP saying he works for the US government this is confirmed Pentagon documents
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:49.440]  that Patriots leaked and we got good people in our government at many levels
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:54.560]  let's talk about this the media is like oh we don't want to talk about that so I
[01:02:54.560 --> 01:02:59.000]  hope that you'll want to discuss that information but you can call in about
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  whatever you want I love to hear from you 800 259 9231 800 259 9231 these
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:14.440]  really are times that try men's souls I mean this is all out in the open this is
[01:03:14.440 --> 01:03:18.280]  the elephant in the room and that's what's so frustrating for me not even
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:26.320]  frustrating it's it's it's disgusting for me to sit here and know their battle
[01:03:26.320 --> 01:03:30.520]  plan it's all stated the White House puts out all these memos and their
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:33.560]  advisors put out memos saying how great it would be if there was a big terror
[01:03:33.560 --> 01:03:37.400]  attack because that would make Obama look like a strong leader and then he
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:40.280]  could take more of our rights away and they just do it in the open like we're
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:44.560]  blind like we're zombies and I guess a lot of the public are zombies they don't
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:48.280]  see themselves in the role of standing up against corruption they don't see
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:51.800]  themselves in the role in fighting tyranny and people trying to jack up
[01:03:51.800 --> 01:03:54.880]  their power prices and rip them off like we're a third world nation this is
[01:03:54.880 --> 01:03:57.840]  what's happened to all the third world countries they get corrupt governments in
[01:03:57.840 --> 01:04:00.960]  that run these same scams and the multinationals come in and teach them
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:04.480]  how to do it and finance the whole thing and it's happening in Western Europe
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:07.840]  it's happening in the US and Canada it's happening in Eastern Europe now
[01:04:07.840 --> 01:04:12.080]  they're doing it in the Middle East now this is a predatory system of control
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:17.040]  and domination they want us poor they want us dependent on them and I'm tired
[01:04:17.040 --> 01:04:21.840]  of it I want it to stop I have three children I have a wife I love I know
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:25.760]  you've got family you love this is wrong I mean if they get away with all of this
[01:04:25.760 --> 01:04:31.480]  what's next we're going off the deep end we're going off the cliff here and yeah
[01:04:31.480 --> 01:04:37.720]  a lot of folks are waking up but we've got a really consciously realized the
[01:04:37.720 --> 01:04:44.440]  super hardcore off-the-chart severity of exactly what we're dealing with here I
[01:04:44.440 --> 01:04:48.720]  will come back go your phone calls I'll lean on the ropes lean on the callers
[01:04:48.720 --> 01:04:51.440]  because I'm I'm I'm just getting an incredible headache even dealing with
[01:04:51.440 --> 01:04:57.480]  this than Max Kaiser's coming up it's just it's it's unbelievable info wars.com
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:03.040]  wasn't bought a dot TV or the websites you've heard Alex explain how the
[01:05:03.040 --> 01:05:06.840]  Silver Lungs generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:10.800]  colloidal silver solutions yet many are unaware of the entire function of the
[01:05:10.800 --> 01:05:13.840]  Silver Lungs system and how it has been designed to deliver your silver
[01:05:13.840 --> 01:05:19.000]  solutions anywhere in or on the body my name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:23.160]  developer of the Silver Lungs generator not only does the Silver Lungs system
[01:05:23.160 --> 01:05:27.400]  produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions it also comes equipped
[01:05:27.400 --> 01:05:31.720]  with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions
[01:05:31.720 --> 01:05:39.280]  directly to key target areas this includes the eyes ears nose lungs topically to
[01:05:39.280 --> 01:05:43.720]  the skin and orally for the digestive system be sure to watch our new seven

[01:06:04.680 --> 01:06:08.880]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:13.200]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[01:06:13.200 --> 01:06:17.160]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[01:06:17.160 --> 01:06:21.480]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[01:06:21.480 --> 01:06:25.840]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:29.600]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:33.680]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[01:06:33.680 --> 01:06:37.440]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[01:06:37.440 --> 01:06:41.480]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[01:06:41.480 --> 01:06:44.200]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[01:08:57.200 --> 01:09:02.000]  just joined us we've got the headline see something say something exposed as a
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  hoax many of the phone numbers on official Homeland Security websites
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:10.760]  and flyers just don't even go to a voicemail that says you cannot a robot
[01:09:10.760 --> 01:09:16.560]  voice says you cannot leave a message at this number beep and it's a number I've
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:20.760]  called before and gotten them you call Homeland Security in DC and say I want
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:24.280]  to report evidence of who the real terrorists are they won't let you they
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:27.360]  say call your local police they just send you to voicemail we gave them our
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:31.080]  numbers they haven't called us back I've been calling them since Sunday live and
[01:09:31.080 --> 01:09:35.120]  off air let's test this number oh it doesn't work let's test that number these
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:40.680]  are new numbers recently put out I mean you can't get them but a paper box flies
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:45.640]  out of a car they call it in themselves shut down the highway send out a
[01:09:45.640 --> 01:09:50.080]  million-dollar robot Austin just spent over a million bucks on some robots and
[01:09:50.080 --> 01:09:53.720]  the defense complex gets the money and they just run around constantly blowing
[01:09:53.720 --> 01:09:57.960]  up cardboard boxes and say we don't know it was a bomb but we blew it up then
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:10:01.360]  you can pull up the after-action reports when they're releasing it's nothing in
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:05.400]  it they just hold it might have been a bomb well oh oh oh terrorists may have
[01:10:05.400 --> 01:10:09.880]  just hit Belton you know they said of back in 2000 and we go up there and it's
[01:10:09.880 --> 01:10:13.560]  a drill and then they tell everybody terrorist hit I mean it's just
[01:10:13.560 --> 01:10:20.040]  psychological warfare against the people and now it the Texas Electricity
[01:10:20.040 --> 01:10:23.160]  Reliability Commission has said no we didn't have any malfunctions of our
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:28.840]  power plants we've not been allowed to build new power plants and so we're
[01:10:28.840 --> 01:10:34.000]  being taxed by the cold weather and and the White House Energy Secretary comes
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:38.120]  out in a press conference yesterday and says we're gonna shut down massive
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:41.680]  amounts let me give you the actual headline White House lies on blackouts
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:48.240]  exposed here's Newsmax massive closures of US cold plants looms shoe says and
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:51.400]  they've got his quotes in a press conference by they're gonna close
[01:10:51.400 --> 01:10:54.640]  massive numbers down but the White House says no we're not we're not shutting
[01:10:54.640 --> 01:11:00.560]  anything down we're Alex is a liar meanwhile yeah we're shutting them down
[01:11:00.560 --> 01:11:04.280]  it's like when I had David and Rothschild and others on pushing carbon
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:08.280]  taxes they'd be all over TV pushing global carbon taxes I got on and say you
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:13.920]  want carbon taxes no this is nothing to do with carbon taxes I mean they just
[01:11:13.920 --> 01:11:22.920]  talked to us like we're morons it's incredible it's just incredible let's
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:27.600]  go to your phone calls Rick in Tennessee thanks for holding hey Alex how you
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:30.960]  doing I'm doing all right man I just want to let you know that I took your
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:35.840]  advice and I started a coalition against the water forwardation here in in
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:40.040]  Murfreesboro Tennessee it's Rutherford County citizens against
[01:11:40.040 --> 01:11:42.800]  water forwardation and seems to be getting some traction so I just want to
[01:11:42.800 --> 01:11:45.760]  let you know that and then the second thing I was wanting to congratulate you
[01:11:45.760 --> 01:11:50.040]  on your advertisements that are here on local stations they were for the
[01:11:50.040 --> 01:11:55.640]  Stansbury thing they actually are using your voice on WLAC which is the same
[01:11:55.640 --> 01:12:02.600]  station that Beck is on and as well as WTN so that's that's cool and yeah and I
[01:12:02.600 --> 01:12:05.600]  just want to tell you guys to keep up the great work that's all I wanted to do
[01:12:05.600 --> 01:12:11.480]  well let me throw this at you Rick as you form that cadre against water
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:15.800]  fluoridation and as Calgary and San Diego and all these other cities either
[01:12:15.800 --> 01:12:21.200]  take it out or move to block it being put in as we give support to the vast
[01:12:21.200 --> 01:12:26.600]  majority of government scientists who signed on to national papers saying it's
[01:12:26.600 --> 01:12:30.880]  sevenfold I always said a doubling that was one study I was covering from years
[01:12:30.880 --> 01:12:36.280]  ago the new studies they saw sevenfold increase in men tripling in women I
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:40.640]  mean I'm getting chills right now it attacks your fertility in men and women
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:45.360]  it attacks the thyroid all these brain disorders are up that's in the news
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:49.440]  strokes are up in young people people are dropping dead all over from the
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:55.800]  aspartame and the fluoride but here's the key Rick you form that coalition you
[01:12:55.800 --> 01:12:59.840]  start having victories once you have that coalition and you start having
[01:12:59.840 --> 01:13:04.240]  victories like Washington at Trenton politically then you can take that same
[01:13:04.240 --> 01:13:08.800]  cadre of true activists that love liberty and you can start dealing with
[01:13:08.800 --> 01:13:12.760]  all the other corruption in your area you can start dealing with the
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:16.680]  federalization of your police the threat fusion centers the illegal checkpoints
[01:13:16.680 --> 01:13:21.040]  that your governor's been fighting in Tennessee you can start moving down the
[01:13:21.040 --> 01:13:26.840]  line once you pick an issue whether it's fighting the corruption of the TSA or
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:30.480]  fighting the move against the Second Amendment and then spin-offs of those
[01:13:30.480 --> 01:13:35.280]  it's so incredible so I salute you that's the whole thing I'm using like the
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:38.920]  Dave Ramsey philosophy and that's like start with the smallest one first and
[01:13:38.920 --> 01:13:42.200]  go for it and it actually I have to do make some cute communications I'm
[01:13:42.200 --> 01:13:45.160]  finding out that the border fluoridation is not a mandate it's a
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:50.000]  voluntary situation and I even talked with the water company about that and he
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.360]  says no it's voluntary so I said okay we're gonna be at the board meeting as
[01:13:53.360 --> 01:13:58.920]  soon as I get enough people you know to represent to go in as a group I mean not
[01:13:58.920 --> 01:14:01.880]  as the whole group not taking everybody having enough people that you know you
[01:14:01.880 --> 01:14:05.240]  got enough force behind you saying hey we don't want this anymore Rick let me
[01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:08.520]  tell you how they're gonna counter you I don't know what your county's getting
[01:14:08.520 --> 01:14:12.280]  but it's probably in the hundreds of thousands of years in the hundreds of
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:17.600]  thousands of dollars so when you go in they're gonna say Rick and guys we're
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:21.800]  getting hundreds of thousands in some big cities millions from the federal
[01:14:21.800 --> 01:14:27.560]  government yes this is voluntary but if we want our Clean Water Act funding in
[01:14:27.560 --> 01:14:31.720]  that Orwellian oxymoron a Clean Water Act and they use funding through it to
[01:14:31.720 --> 01:14:36.320]  try to force cities to put water in they're gonna say Rick taxpayers we need
[01:14:36.320 --> 01:14:39.440]  this federal money well it's your tax money that was taken to begin with and
[01:14:39.440 --> 01:14:43.880]  then used to control you but then they're not gonna tell you by the way and
[01:14:43.880 --> 01:14:49.200]  I've looked at this in other cities generally buying the fluoride generally
[01:14:49.200 --> 01:14:53.880]  cost more than even what the federal stipend is so you can counter them with
[01:14:53.880 --> 01:14:57.880]  that well you're not gonna have to pay for the fluoride anymore the overpriced
[01:14:57.880 --> 01:15:03.280]  poison and so that generally in cities we've looked at will be more than the
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:08.240]  federal funding for your water district they also come in with Clean Water Acts
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:12.280]  and make you put in more systems that actually toxify the water so it's too
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:16.200]  expensive for your local city to run it to incentivize you to sell it out to
[01:15:16.200 --> 01:15:21.160]  foreigners so this is all part of a strategic program and obviously water
[01:15:21.160 --> 01:15:24.160]  is central God bless you but I wanted to give you some points of how they're
[01:15:24.160 --> 01:15:28.240]  gonna counter you and then when you just say well I've got the city or county
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:32.120]  press release here on how much this fluoride cost the city of Austin pays
[01:15:32.120 --> 01:15:37.080]  close to a million dollars a year for sodium fluoride product out of Florida
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:41.320]  that's got a bunch of other stuff in it now this is stuff that's toxic waste that
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:44.640]  you couldn't pay people to take you got to pay them to store it but they do this
[01:15:44.640 --> 01:15:49.720]  little spin thing and make you buy it it's funny enough Florida should actually
[01:15:49.720 --> 01:15:53.520]  started in Tennessee let's go ahead and talk to Brad and Michigan Brad you're
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:16:00.400]  on the air hello yes sir hey Alex how are you doing good I'm a quick point and
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:05.960]  a question for you to the people that are not awake if they're cutting off the
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:10.920]  power with unprecedented cold sweeping through that means they don't care if
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:15.560]  you freeze in your homes and die which well how many people how many people
[01:16:15.560 --> 01:16:18.360]  have died because they couldn't pay for their power I see it in the news every
[01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:23.160]  week last year and this year and it's almost always some old vet who you know
[01:16:23.160 --> 01:16:27.280]  trying to heat themselves at their stove and has found frozen to death I mean how
[01:16:27.280 --> 01:16:30.560]  many times do we hear about folks in Minnesota and Michigan and New York and
[01:16:30.560 --> 01:16:36.120]  Illinois and places freezing to death right Alex and my point was that you
[01:16:36.120 --> 01:16:39.800]  know if you really believe that these are the same people that are going to
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:44.360]  protect you from terror terrorists who will not protect you from the cold
[01:16:44.360 --> 01:16:48.520]  you're sadly mistaken well then they'll claim their free market they'll say well
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:52.080]  it's your job to pay for overpriced power but they're artificially jacking up
[01:16:52.080 --> 01:16:57.760]  the price cold is dirt cheap literally dirt cheap and these systems are clean
[01:16:57.760 --> 01:17:04.600]  I'm sorry go ahead Alex real quick my question I read an article probably a
[01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:08.480]  couple of two months ago about the thermal belt and the golf and it being
[01:17:08.480 --> 01:17:12.880]  shut down due to the BP oil spill I was wondering if you had a chance to look at
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:17.080]  that and what was your take on it it's inconclusive it's true that the jet
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:20.880]  stream one of the main jet streams has slowed and almost stalled people said
[01:17:20.880 --> 01:17:25.560]  it was the end of the world but it turns out that does happen infrequently and
[01:17:25.560 --> 01:17:29.880]  that's part of the reason now it's not pushing through and keeping those cold
[01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:36.320]  weather systems from dropping down and there was some evidence that that the
[01:17:36.320 --> 01:17:42.960]  areas of the Gulf you know the the water stream not the jet stream did slow down
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:48.240]  for a while but that happens as well I I did look into that I don't know if the
[01:17:48.240 --> 01:17:53.000]  millions and millions of gallons of core exit and the these reportedly billion
[01:17:53.000 --> 01:17:59.840]  plus gallons of oil had an effect on that I just don't know okay well thank
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:02.840]  you for your time Alex and you have a good day buddy thank you so much great
[01:18:02.840 --> 01:18:08.360]  points Brad Skyler in Alaska you're on the air yeah how's it going Alex it's
[01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:14.000]  good a couple quick points for you I checked out this website called new
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:21.200]  world world order calm and it's a blank page and it says August 23rd and that's
[01:18:21.200 --> 01:18:26.000]  it and it says coming soon yeah well there's a lot of people that own websites
[01:18:26.000 --> 01:18:30.640]  and then that's the message it'll have before it's been launched people park
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:35.040]  web domains people created fake Illuminati domains and things think it's
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:38.720]  really the Illuminati you know the internet is rife with hoaxes but that
[01:18:38.720 --> 01:18:42.280]  doesn't sound like a hoax it sounds like you know somebody's got a website
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:51.760]  coming soon indeed and also you got our VP nom not up here and what was the last
[01:18:51.760 --> 01:18:55.680]  thing on Super Bowl Sunday I will know if you saw I'm sure you were working
[01:18:55.680 --> 01:19:02.760]  tail off anyway I watched it and I saw a commercial for the Motorola Zoo perhaps
[01:19:02.760 --> 01:19:08.840]  you saw the commercial yes one is kind of anti 1984 and the others ambivalent
[01:19:08.840 --> 01:19:13.480]  but but but overall it shows how popular the patriot message is that they're
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:21.000]  now kind of having anti 1984 ads it's really a ripoff of the 1984 Apple ad yeah
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:24.480]  I was like okay this is kind of strange well what they're saying is they're
[01:19:24.480 --> 01:19:30.920]  saying Apple claimed they were fighting the 1984 Borg system of IBM but now
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:37.920]  they've become what they were fighting a bunch of zombies so by our open source

[01:24:33.480 --> 01:24:39.960]  let's go ahead and talk to John in Texas you're on the air John. Hi Alex. Hey. Hey
[01:24:39.960 --> 01:24:44.960]  about this diet soda quite a long time ago I had a friend of mine used to live
[01:24:44.960 --> 01:24:48.920]  off diet Pepsi every time we used to come in to work you know he always had a
[01:24:48.920 --> 01:24:54.120]  16 ounce diet Pepsi well well 12 or 13 years ago he died of brain cancer but I
[01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:58.520]  remember that the doctor his personal physician told his wife at the time that
[01:24:58.520 --> 01:25:02.120]  it was aspartame to kill them flat out told them. Oh it's they knew it they
[01:25:02.120 --> 01:25:05.640]  tried to get it approved three times and then Rumsfeld went in as the head of
[01:25:05.640 --> 01:25:09.400]  the company and got it done in 1980 and I mean I've had countless scientists
[01:25:09.400 --> 01:25:13.280]  brain surgeons on and here it is mainstream news young people having
[01:25:13.280 --> 01:25:17.800]  strokes from it but oh we're conspiracy theorist we're evil we're bad okay fine
[01:25:17.800 --> 01:25:22.080]  drink more of it and now it's in over 10,000 processed foods you can't buy
[01:25:22.080 --> 01:25:26.800]  chewing gum or bubble gum now at a gas station or a shopping mall or wherever
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:32.040]  you have to order pure sugar gum online it's in big league chew it's in
[01:25:32.040 --> 01:25:38.800]  everything you cannot find it I mean it's just and I've had family sitting
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:41.760]  there chewing sugar gum in front of me and I go that's got aspartame in it they
[01:25:41.760 --> 01:25:46.600]  go no it doesn't Alex calm man I'm not stupid I go read the back no I don't have
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:49.880]  to read the back this was my cousin great guy really smart and I said I
[01:25:49.880 --> 01:25:53.320]  actually grabbed him on the arm and I said read the back and he went oh my
[01:25:53.320 --> 01:25:56.640]  gosh you're right and I said yeah you think I make stuff up it's everywhere
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:26:01.320]  they've weaponized everything they're killing us and I'm sick of it I'm sorry
[01:26:01.320 --> 01:26:10.600]  go ahead I remember a long time ago that they had a picture in a paper of
[01:26:10.600 --> 01:26:14.720]  this clan group they had they all had Thompson submachine guns that's what
[01:26:14.720 --> 01:26:17.680]  drew me to the article and I read it and they said at the time that the FBI
[01:26:17.680 --> 01:26:21.840]  helped them get the guns and then they use the clan having Thompson's if you
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:26.920]  go back to the 30s to get the first gun laws passed and I don't know if you
[01:26:26.920 --> 01:26:31.080]  remember Edward Wilson he got caught here in Houston back in the early 80s
[01:26:31.080 --> 01:26:36.760]  shipping C4 to Maumar Gaddafi and he said he was doing it for the CIA the CIA
[01:26:36.760 --> 01:26:40.600]  denied it they said that he was a rogue agent they they give him a trial they
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:43.920]  he was found guilty he was sentenced to life in prison he was in there about 10
[01:26:43.920 --> 01:26:50.320]  years they he got a new trial a new lawyer they found the evidence and what
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:56.400]  about two years ago a high-level CIA you know black-op commander they pull him
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:59.160]  over on the road he was reportedly trying to get in tell the people that
[01:26:59.160 --> 01:27:03.720]  had come out and the Houston cops just executing because the CIA's got cops in
[01:27:03.720 --> 01:27:06.640]  every department big department I mean they just I mean they've got hit teams
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:09.560]  in the Austin department they just got they just call them up take them out
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:13.920]  they'll pull you over right in front of news cameras nothing happens I mean
[01:27:13.920 --> 01:27:17.900]  that's what it is working for this government he got a new trial like they
[01:27:17.900 --> 01:27:22.680]  found him innocent the judge exonerated them and and they found out he really
[01:27:22.680 --> 01:27:27.040]  was working for the CIA shipping C4 to Maumar Gaddafi but at the time nobody
[01:27:27.040 --> 01:27:33.040]  said hey what the CIA doing shipping C4 to Maumar Gaddafi they run the people
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:37.240]  think one-dimensionally they think well Alex says Al Qaeda is government run
[01:27:37.240 --> 01:27:41.920]  that means he loves Muslim extremist no look I know I don't it's have
[01:27:41.920 --> 01:27:46.120]  multi-dimensional thinking folks the globalist who aren't Americans who
[01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:49.760]  want to destroy this country are funding the radical Muslims and Glenn Beck
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:53.800]  yesterday was saying it's all George Soros he's only a small part of it is
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:59.320]  George Soros the Secretary of the Army meeting and running Anwar al-Alaqi no

[01:28:05.680 --> 01:28:12.880]  intel we've got the proof I appreciate your call John the stuff really starts
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:15.760]  to get to me at a certain point it was just so out in the open I can't believe
[01:28:15.760 --> 01:28:20.480]  it I wanted to stop I want to get off this roller coaster I want to get our
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:28.320]  country back I just want to be free let's go ahead and talk to Noel and
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:33.320]  Illinois go ahead Alex man it was a clear sky day about an hour ago and the
[01:28:33.320 --> 01:28:38.160]  aerosol sprays are hitting us pretty hard man it's it's crazy people don't
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:43.080]  people can't realize this they're clearly clearly zombies but now the
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:46.400]  government wants to put lithium in the water they know the aspartame is
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:49.920]  deductive and brain damages people I mean that they're running full spectrum
[01:28:49.920 --> 01:28:56.040]  black ops on us the government loves us Alex what can I say a quickly you're
[01:28:56.040 --> 01:29:01.880]  talking about the blackouts in Texas I mean should we should we be shocked

[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:26.040]  we have to get communities together I agree but I have to disagree it's not
[01:29:26.040 --> 01:29:29.480]  that they don't just not care about us they hate us they want to get rid of us

[01:36:13.360 --> 01:36:20.160]  stock exchange and the list goes on and on TV hosts with BBC RT Al Jazeera
[01:36:20.160 --> 01:36:26.600]  press TV Genesis Radio host Saturdays it just goes on and on has a radio talk

[01:36:31.360 --> 01:36:35.400]  developments with the global markets he's predicted all of this and so have we
[01:36:35.400 --> 01:36:41.360]  but now it's here why is this happening and how big of a deal is it Max Kaiser
[01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:47.800]  well the volume of these exchanges is collapsing so they have to emerge and
[01:36:47.800 --> 01:36:51.520]  because of the legitimate volume you know most the volume of the New York stock
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:57.520]  exchange is the US government itself buying stocks to keep volumes on these
[01:36:57.520 --> 01:37:04.040]  exchanges the the actual underlying participation by the average person is
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:08.040]  just not there anymore because the economy is collapsing and the folks are
[01:37:08.040 --> 01:37:11.640]  not participating in the stock market like they used to so there's a huge
[01:37:11.640 --> 01:37:15.560]  mergers going on and now you've got this international merger with the German
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:20.080]  Boris and the New York Stock Exchange coming together and an attempt to
[01:37:20.080 --> 01:37:25.200]  resuscitate a dying model you know the pre-market capitalism is dying it's
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:30.160]  being replaced with the Politburo style command control economic modeling from
[01:37:30.160 --> 01:37:34.200]  the Fed and now the global Fed which is in the pipeline we've learned that
[01:37:34.200 --> 01:37:38.600]  Davos they're going to come up with they knew $100 trillion credit line in a
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:44.760]  global bank and a global currency because competition is dead nobody wants to
[01:37:44.760 --> 01:37:48.480]  compete anymore they all want to be little dictators so they've gotten rid of
[01:37:48.480 --> 01:37:52.240]  that concept and now they pull this off they've got to merge these exchanges
[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:56.720]  and create just two or three super exchanges is that not just more layering
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:38:01.560]  of the debt pushing the band car SDR you'll still have regional currencies
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:05.000]  but they're going to be based in that new digital currency and that gives them a
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  new level to the Ponzi scheme but how much time does that buy well it rolls
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:16.920]  all the current debts into a new global hundred billion dollar debt facility and
[01:38:16.920 --> 01:38:23.560]  as a way to prevent a collapse but as the country has lost their individual
[01:38:23.560 --> 01:38:27.800]  sovereignty during the creation of the euro this means that countries like the
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:33.160]  U.S. lose its sovereignty in the creation of a global central bank and
[01:38:33.160 --> 01:38:38.520]  currency of some type but I think my my preference is the SDR I think will
[01:38:38.520 --> 01:38:42.160]  become increasingly more the special drawing right which is already being
[01:38:42.160 --> 01:38:47.560]  used globally as a global currency it gets the bigger and is used more by
[01:38:47.560 --> 01:38:51.200]  countries around the world other people have different views on this but I
[01:38:51.200 --> 01:38:58.680]  think the SDR is going to see that grow this year and of course the resistance
[01:38:58.680 --> 01:39:04.080]  is on the street pushing back so you've got your audience and your
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:09.040]  audience you know you're constantly asking the question when will folks in the
[01:39:09.040 --> 01:39:14.040]  U.S. wake up well they've woken up in Egypt and they woke up in Tunisia they're
[01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:17.480]  waking up around the world so the global insurrection against the banker
[01:39:17.480 --> 01:39:23.640]  occupation is alive and well well we did predict three years ago and since
[01:39:23.640 --> 01:39:27.880]  them incessantly that there would be global food riots and overthrow of
[01:39:27.880 --> 01:39:32.200]  governments this is a complex issue people say well Alex the news is
[01:39:32.200 --> 01:39:36.280]  reporting that the U.S. government funded the Muslim Brotherhood and al-Bari and
[01:39:36.280 --> 01:39:40.880]  the other factions and did trigger this three weeks ago well then how are you
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:46.160]  saying it's a real insurrection if they triggered it they recognize the climate
[01:39:46.160 --> 01:39:50.720]  they recognize that the dominoes are now set they don't want it to fall over
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:56.000]  triggered by real domestic groups they are officially trigger it to then be
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:01.400]  able to try to steer it the question is will they be a successful in doing that
[01:40:01.400 --> 01:40:05.880]  and where do you see this global insurrection going obviously it's
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:08.840]  triggered first in countries where half the populations making two dollars a
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:13.240]  day or less and people are starving food riots are spreading how do you see
[01:40:13.240 --> 01:40:18.360]  these dominoes falling right so in Egypt the number two guy who supposedly is
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:25.640]  taking over who barrack is a CIA friendly chap who I was clearly would not
[01:40:25.640 --> 01:40:29.480]  make the situation better but the people on the ground the people in the
[01:40:29.480 --> 01:40:33.440]  street are pretty knowledgeable about this though they're not going to accept
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:38.880]  that and so that's the way a revolution is now this revolution is growing in
[01:40:38.880 --> 01:40:43.640]  scope and in size because now the workers across the country have gone on strike
[01:40:43.640 --> 01:40:48.440]  as of yesterday you've got workers around the Suez Canal and other parts of
[01:40:48.440 --> 01:40:51.280]  the country on strike and when the workers go on strike that's usually
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:56.520]  generally a huge step toward a successful revolution and the intelligence
[01:40:56.520 --> 01:41:01.160]  that's being passed around is great because of the internet and the country
[01:41:01.160 --> 01:41:04.720]  of course tried to hit the internet kill switch but after three days they
[01:41:04.720 --> 01:41:08.320]  realized that it's very difficult to hit the internet kill switch without also
[01:41:08.320 --> 01:41:13.160]  hitting the economic kill switch so they had to turn it back on so this is
[01:41:13.160 --> 01:41:18.120]  something that's been exploited by the insurrection of the same all over the
[01:41:18.120 --> 01:41:21.280]  world that's because we're now in an industrialized world and certainly with
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:27.440]  communications Egypt is industrialized not in many other respects that that
[01:41:27.440 --> 01:41:31.760]  now we are dependent on it this is how we communicate this is how the markets
[01:41:31.760 --> 01:41:35.920]  now move this is how people purchase a lot of things this is what businesses are
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:41.260]  based on and so the globalists have built the web as a surveillance grid but
[01:41:41.260 --> 01:41:46.600]  now the populations are seizing it as a tool of liberty and more and more I see
[01:41:46.600 --> 01:41:51.760]  the internet truly transcending what it was originally built for as a control
[01:41:51.760 --> 01:41:55.600]  tool and I see this as one of the biggest cases of something backfiring on
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:42:01.120]  the New World Order well you yourself I've hacked the attempt to control the
[01:42:01.120 --> 01:42:06.280]  the internet by doing the Google bomb okay so the Alex Jones Info Wars audience
[01:42:06.280 --> 01:42:10.280]  they launched a Google bomb and it bypasses all the controls to keep the
[01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:15.280]  media sweet on a very narrow definition of what is news on that particular day
[01:42:15.280 --> 01:42:19.840]  now I think going forward the United States if I can project what might happen
[01:42:19.840 --> 01:42:24.400]  in the US that would fall into the category of an insurrection or a
[01:42:24.400 --> 01:42:31.480]  revolution similar what we're seeing in Cairo and then tennis I'm reading that
[01:42:31.480 --> 01:42:36.680]  more and more people in the US to the houses are now underwater that would
[01:42:36.680 --> 01:42:40.760]  they choose your mortgages and the price the real estate is down they're just
[01:42:40.760 --> 01:42:44.760]  staying in the homes well there's there's you know they have the option in
[01:42:44.760 --> 01:42:49.920]  the US of what's called jingle mail you leave the the key to the house in the
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:54.320]  mail and you walk away from your mortgage and people have selectively done this and
[01:42:54.320 --> 01:42:58.240]  people in government have talked about you know produce the note where's the
[01:42:58.240 --> 01:43:01.880]  note foreclosure gate at the banks that are involved in the foreclosure they
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:07.760]  sold miss sold the mortgages to begin with they miss package the mortgages etc.
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:12.640]  but what I'm hearing is that there is a more and more of this of an idea where
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:18.440]  you could have a million mortgage to walk away on one day so a million home
[01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:21.600]  owners or maybe just a hundred thousand homeowners but possibly a million
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:25.440]  homeowners coast to coast in America they say pick a date in the future two
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:29.960]  months from today let's say and they say on that day a hundred thousand of us
[01:43:29.960 --> 01:43:37.240]  or 200,000 of us will simultaneously walk away from our underwater home our bad
[01:43:37.240 --> 01:43:41.440]  mortgage now that's what that goes forward then that will completely
[01:43:41.440 --> 01:43:45.800]  destroy the banking cartel in a huge way and they're using the social networking
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:50.160]  site and they're using the Facebook and the Twitter to organize a math movement
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:55.680]  in that way so that could be America's version of a global and to participate in
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:59.520]  the global and direction against bank or occupation I want to expand on something
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:03.440]  the head of the energy department has announced yesterday they are going to
[01:44:03.440 --> 01:44:08.040]  quote shut down massive numbers of power plants in the US last Friday the
[01:44:08.040 --> 01:44:12.280]  White House on the front page responded to our story about how they're shutting
[01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:16.680]  down other power plants but letting GE have a waiver and keep theirs open and
[01:44:16.680 --> 01:44:20.880]  expand new ones so regardless of where you stand on global warming this is
[01:44:20.880 --> 01:44:26.600]  selective energy shutdowns for the guys that are on the inside of the cartel
[01:44:26.600 --> 01:44:32.760]  that's what she'll chest you did for his own profit more than tripling prices
[01:44:32.760 --> 01:44:38.560]  and shutting down his competition Romania that's directly what led to his
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:44.120]  overthrow we're seeing rebellions all over the world now including in China
[01:44:44.120 --> 01:44:49.720]  over people's electricity cutting in and out but the fact that the White House
[01:44:49.720 --> 01:44:55.240]  now has to respond to us that really really does show the power of the
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:45:00.560]  alternative medium we mentioned earlier and what happened in California a few
[01:45:00.560 --> 01:45:04.840]  years ago they just went ahead and jacked up rates and then you know
[01:45:04.840 --> 01:45:10.120]  caused tremendous amount of pain just by gouging prices to manipulate the prices
[01:45:10.120 --> 01:45:14.560]  and what's going on in Texas right now with the power attitude I would not be
[01:45:14.560 --> 01:45:18.280]  surprised to find out that this is in fact just more the same kind of price
[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:23.640]  gouging energy companies gouging prices for profit but looking at the whole
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:28.720]  situation from a more broader perspective remember that when the US went off the
[01:45:28.720 --> 01:45:33.480]  gold standard 1971 they adopted what was called the petrodollar standard the US
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:38.600]  and Saudi Arabia had a quid pro quo that the US would buy lots of oil if they
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:43.200]  from Saudi Arabia they recycled that money through the US economy and this
[01:45:43.200 --> 01:45:47.880]  gave birth to a tremendous 30-year period of growth of globalization and
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:52.920]  growth of credit to finance this globalization that would be the growth
[01:45:52.920 --> 01:45:56.440]  of the dollar of the world reserve currency now starting in 2007 we know
[01:45:56.440 --> 01:46:01.320]  that we had a credit crunch Lehman brothers one bad golden sacks almost
[01:46:01.320 --> 01:46:04.400]  one possible for handcalls of billing them out for Congress banked all over
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:08.360]  the world almost one box because all the credit that's been created since 1971
[01:46:08.360 --> 01:46:14.800]  the globe is p credit they had all the credit saturation you can't absorb any
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:19.880]  more credit and this is the story that it's good it's impossible no matter how
[01:46:19.880 --> 01:46:25.320]  much more money that the rank you create they cannot re-stimulate the economy to
[01:46:25.320 --> 01:46:28.920]  go back to where they were 10 or 15 years ago which means that any energy
[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:33.040]  path which has been co-dependent growing co-dependently along with the credit
[01:46:33.040 --> 01:46:41.600]  growth is also in a contraction phase so Saudi Arabia just came out two days
[01:46:41.600 --> 01:46:45.160]  ago they said that they've been overstating their reserves by 40% of
[01:46:45.160 --> 01:46:49.600]  which we reported on in our Al Jazeera English film four years ago the energy
[01:46:49.600 --> 01:46:54.320]  supplies of these three major fields the Gawar Saudi Arabia Cantrell in Mexico
[01:46:54.320 --> 01:46:59.600]  and Bergen and Kuwait have all been in rapid decline Mexico is now an oil
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:04.240]  importer the UK is now an oil importer Egypt just this year became an oil
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:08.160]  importer that's part of the reason why now inflation is running high and the
[01:47:08.160 --> 01:47:11.520]  people are on the streets because the entire energy sector along with the
[01:47:11.520 --> 01:47:15.640]  credit sector take those two together they're both collapsing they're both
[01:47:15.640 --> 01:47:20.720]  they're coterminous you've got a credit and energy collapse simultaneous and the
[01:47:20.720 --> 01:47:26.120]  people are simply at the end of their tether they're on the street now and
[01:47:26.120 --> 01:47:30.000]  it's no going back because you've never gonna get the credit back and you're
[01:47:30.000 --> 01:47:35.720]  not gonna get those reserves back at that price well max all the analysts I
[01:47:35.720 --> 01:47:40.040]  respect going back when I really woke up 18 19 years ago I've been on air 16
[01:47:40.040 --> 01:47:44.920]  years said that the globalists are gonna flood the world with derivatives I
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:48.480]  mean I was talking about this 13 years ago I had economists like George Humphrey
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:52.760]  on 12 years ago who broke down everything that's now happened with total
[01:47:52.760 --> 01:47:57.160]  precision he wrote books about how it was gonna unfold that the globalists
[01:47:57.160 --> 01:48:02.880]  would sell globalism through all this fiat fraudulent wealth they made but
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:07.440]  that they plan to implode it later cause world revolution but actually
[01:48:07.440 --> 01:48:12.200]  misdirected against the nation states themselves bring the world into greater
[01:48:12.200 --> 01:48:16.840]  crisis just like the IMF and World Bank doing third-world countries triggering
[01:48:16.840 --> 01:48:21.040]  the IMF riot as they call it and then offer their global currency as the
[01:48:21.040 --> 01:48:25.480]  solution that's what Davos did as you know two weeks ago with a 100 trillion
[01:48:25.480 --> 01:48:29.640]  they want of taxpayer money to to save us they'll then leverage it at least ten
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:36.080]  times to one quadrillion I mean this has really been an organized system because
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:39.840]  it's on paper that they organized it I mean do you disagree that the big central
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:45.360]  banks have planned all of this no I don't disagree because any money that has
[01:48:45.360 --> 01:48:48.720]  interest attached to it there's an incentive to flood the market with as
[01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:52.200]  much of it as possible because you're always ahead of the curve in terms of
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:55.440]  the amount of interest to go collect versus any liability associated with the
[01:48:55.440 --> 01:48:59.200]  debts you're incurring so money with interest attached is something that
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:03.320]  these banks and these central banks flood the globe with because they know
[01:49:03.320 --> 01:49:07.920]  it's the form of it's a soft imperial conquest they don't need it you know
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:11.920]  that when people talk about the currency wars that are going on now the US is
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:16.480]  using artificially cheap US dollars to try to interfere in foreign government
[01:49:16.480 --> 01:49:21.560]  affairs and take control of property and wealth using cheap dollars that they
[01:49:21.560 --> 01:49:25.440]  know full well that when the dollar eventually collapses that they will have
[01:49:25.440 --> 01:49:29.840]  assets to show for those dollars so the soft dollar with current with interest
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:34.640]  rate attached to it it's something that is flooded into the market who has a
[01:49:34.640 --> 01:49:40.920]  way of controlling those and the Chinese have the incredibly soft yawn to
[01:49:40.920 --> 01:49:45.240]  uh... underpin the united states and the industrialize us
[01:49:45.240 --> 01:49:48.960]  well that's part of the currency war now it was coming out
[01:49:48.960 --> 01:49:51.920]  recently with a robert zellick now coming out saying we're going to look at
[01:49:51.920 --> 01:49:53.240]  gold again
[01:49:53.240 --> 01:49:54.880]  and with uh...
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:55.860]  jp morgan
[01:49:55.860 --> 01:49:59.320]  uh... just recently said that they're going to recognize gold bullion as
[01:49:59.320 --> 01:50:03.080]  collateral for derivatives for the first time they've made that statement
[01:50:03.080 --> 01:50:08.480]  so now suddenly gold and silver are being talked about in terms of a currency
[01:50:08.480 --> 01:50:11.040]  that hasn't been on and the central bank
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:13.840]  uh... for the past thirty years of the net sellers
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:15.280]  of gold now they're net
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:16.840]  buyers of gold
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:21.200]  though this is not setting the stage for this huge showdown between which
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:24.160]  country has the most gold and of course the u.s.
[01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:26.180]  reportedly have a thousand times
[01:50:26.180 --> 01:50:29.680]  china has only a thousand times germany has three thousand times with sixty six
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:31.520]  percent of that is held in new york
[01:50:31.520 --> 01:50:36.480]  and as was the point made recently by a very very smart guy jim rickard
[01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:39.200]  you can have on your show the gold in new york
[01:50:39.200 --> 01:50:41.320]  i could be commented by the u.s.
[01:50:41.320 --> 01:50:45.080]  so that the u.s. now it's only fourteen thousand times of gold may become
[01:50:45.080 --> 01:50:45.880]  as rickard
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:46.840]  refers to it
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:48.760]  the Saudi arabia of gold
[01:50:48.760 --> 01:50:53.160]  so he's got a bit of gold becomes a big factor i'd say there
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:55.000]  well i mean let's talk about gold and silver
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:51:06.920]  on the other side and where you see that trend going
[01:51:06.920 --> 01:51:09.120]  you'll never buy canning lids ever again
[01:51:09.120 --> 01:51:11.960]  safely store emergency preparedness foods for years
[01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:15.440]  traditional metal lids are single use throwaways containing bpa
[01:51:15.440 --> 01:51:18.960]  but had the reusable canning lids are guaranteed to last a lifetime when use
[01:51:18.960 --> 01:51:20.440]  as designed for home canning
[01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:24.200]  tather lids are made with a u s d a n f d a approved food grade plastic
[01:51:24.200 --> 01:51:27.360]  safer direct food contact and contain no bpa
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:30.880]  tather lids are dishwashers safe usable with standard pressure or water bath
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:34.840]  canning eliminate food spoilage from acid corrosion fit standard mason jars
[01:51:34.840 --> 01:51:38.800]  are indefinitely reusable and are probably made in the u s a place orders

[01:52:01.080 --> 01:52:04.480]  hi this is alex jones did you know that the global elite are now storing
[01:52:04.480 --> 01:52:07.960]  non-hybrid seeds and secret storage vaults near the arctic circle
[01:52:07.960 --> 01:52:11.200]  did you know that in a real meltdown non-hybrid seeds could become more
[01:52:11.200 --> 01:52:12.920]  valuable than silver or gold
[01:52:12.920 --> 01:52:16.360]  it's true seeds about perform even golden silver before in this country and
[01:52:16.360 --> 01:52:18.480]  it's possible that could even happen again
[01:52:18.480 --> 01:52:22.200]  so our friends at solutions from science put together the perfect mix of
[01:52:22.200 --> 01:52:23.760]  non-hybrid seeds

[01:54:36.760 --> 01:54:39.080]  if you look at the ten-year graph eleven-year graph obviously gold and
[01:54:39.080 --> 01:54:40.400]  silver's going straight up
[01:54:40.400 --> 01:54:42.240]  but they have these little dips
[01:54:42.240 --> 01:54:45.400]  uh... and it's even as you know coming out lawsuits at the fellow reserve and

[01:54:56.000 --> 01:55:02.480]  well a couple things first of all in london uh... couple weeks ago and i met in person with andrew mcguire you know he was the whistleblower
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:04.000]  in london who blew the
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:05.680]  the whistle on the gold

[01:56:09.920 --> 01:56:12.240]  percent annualized gains it's been a new
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:14.360]  at the beginning of a bull market it
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:18.120]  about ready to start phase two of the bull market which we're going to see
[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:19.560]  the big juicy
[01:56:19.560 --> 01:56:20.360]  gains
[01:56:20.360 --> 01:56:22.560]  a parabolic game that are coming up
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:25.560]  but the point i was making before the the uh... break is that
[01:56:25.560 --> 01:56:29.040]  the world is always been on a gold standard
[01:56:29.040 --> 01:56:31.100]  uh... up in nineteen
[01:56:31.100 --> 01:56:35.880]  uh... seventy one when the u.s. close the gold window we entered an experiment
[01:56:35.880 --> 01:56:39.800]  of global fiat currency that traded against each other that experiment now
[01:56:39.800 --> 01:56:42.520]  about the two thousand and ten two thousand eleven is going to be a
[01:56:42.520 --> 01:56:44.400]  failure
[01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:45.520]  people realize that
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:46.840]  you have to go back on
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:50.320]  some kind of gold and i want to go back to this bombshell tell folks again for
[01:56:50.320 --> 01:56:52.400]  the uh... briefly only a few minutes left
[01:56:52.400 --> 01:56:54.560]  who this whistleblower is where he worked
[01:56:54.560 --> 01:56:56.280]  what that caused and
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:56:59.920]  uh... and i mean i obviously you're hinting his bombshell is that the
[01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:03.320]  system is already waiting in those just like you told us two years before the
[01:57:03.320 --> 01:57:07.080]  Icelandic implosion you met with bankers who bragged about it
[01:57:07.080 --> 01:57:10.640]  no i had to tell you that uh... they put the launch of global currency a year
[01:57:10.640 --> 01:57:12.280]  before they did
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:14.320]  well we know you're a hundred percent real so
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:17.000]  we got two minutes tell us what's happening
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:21.040]  uh... yeah well okay i had to require you know as we've been talking about he
[01:57:21.040 --> 01:57:25.600]  gave them evidence about the one in the market association he said i could show
[01:57:25.600 --> 01:57:28.460]  you how they manipulate prices he said in advance
[01:57:28.460 --> 01:57:30.320]  how prices are going to be manipulated
[01:57:30.320 --> 01:57:31.560]  uh... sure enough
[01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:35.120]  uh... exactly what he said he was going to do what exactly is what happened
[01:57:35.120 --> 01:57:38.840]  and uh... but they set up a uh... they don't they didn't broadcast that
[01:57:38.840 --> 01:57:39.800]  information
[01:57:39.800 --> 01:57:41.920]  uh... he's getting up to additional information
[01:57:41.920 --> 01:57:47.640]  he got the good news about how these banks are participating in fraudulently
[01:57:47.640 --> 01:57:49.960]  keeping the price artificially suppressed
[01:57:49.960 --> 01:57:51.400]  and jp morgan
[01:57:51.400 --> 01:57:53.840]  uh... huge multi-billion short
[01:57:53.840 --> 01:57:56.640]  over position you know they're short something like three billion out of the
[01:57:56.640 --> 01:57:57.240]  there's
[01:57:57.240 --> 01:57:59.320]  only a billion out of the silver
[01:57:59.320 --> 01:58:02.760]  available in the entire world because forty four of the forty five billion
[01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:04.280]  out of the never been mine
[01:58:04.280 --> 01:58:05.280]  i've been used up
[01:58:05.280 --> 01:58:08.800]  it's used up already in their landfills itself i was gone there's only a
[01:58:08.800 --> 01:58:10.120]  billion out of this
[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:12.520]  it's a thirty billion dollar industry that's it
[01:58:12.520 --> 01:58:14.240]  uh... anyway so this is coming
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:16.880]  it's a bombshell that's kind of a people in jail
[01:58:16.880 --> 01:58:21.680]  and uh... it'll be the basis for why these metals in particular silver
[01:58:21.680 --> 01:58:23.640]  won't be on their way forward
[01:58:23.640 --> 01:58:25.040]  much much harder
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:28.000]  how long till the bombshell comes out because this is very dangerous what
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.640]  you're reporting obviously
[01:58:30.640 --> 01:58:33.200]  uh... a few weeks

[01:58:54.160 --> 01:58:55.520]  solar power generator
[01:58:55.520 --> 01:58:56.440]  number one
[01:58:56.440 --> 01:58:59.880]  new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill
[01:58:59.880 --> 01:59:00.740]  number two
[01:59:00.740 --> 01:59:04.440]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:59:04.440 --> 01:59:05.600]  allows you to have
[01:59:05.600 --> 01:59:09.720]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:11.240]  technology is coming
[01:59:11.240 --> 01:59:14.840]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[01:59:14.840 --> 01:59:18.980]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[01:59:18.980 --> 01:59:23.320]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[01:59:23.320 --> 01:59:26.840]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages
[01:59:26.840 --> 01:59:30.880]  number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and
[01:59:30.880 --> 01:59:34.160]  peace of mind folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by

[02:00:21.120 --> 02:00:23.480]  alex jones
[02:00:23.480 --> 02:00:26.360]  all right we're now into hour number three we've only got
[02:00:26.360 --> 02:00:29.120]  mr. t webster tarpley historian
[02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:32.000]  uh... an economist on for five minutes i'm probably gonna try to get him on
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:33.680]  tomorrow the next few days
[02:00:33.680 --> 02:00:36.040]  uh... because he's breaking down what's happening in egypt they're now
[02:00:36.040 --> 02:00:37.880]  saying we bark will step down
[02:00:37.880 --> 02:00:40.480]  i've been hearing that for three weeks but it looks like he probably is this
[02:00:40.480 --> 02:00:43.360]  time webster briefly give us your analysis
[02:00:43.360 --> 02:00:47.000]  and breakdown of what's happening right now in egypt
[02:00:47.000 --> 02:00:51.200]  well this is a cia military coup it was announced in washington this morning
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:53.720]  by leon panetta the head of the cia
[02:00:53.720 --> 02:00:57.280]  in testimony to the house intelligence committee he said who barack is going to
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:00:58.760]  be out today
[02:00:58.760 --> 02:01:01.880]  though uh... it's all organized behind the scenes the people in the
[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:04.040]  foreground the gaggle of uh...
[02:01:04.040 --> 02:01:07.760]  anarchists and groups in the square these people are the walk-ons they're the
[02:01:07.760 --> 02:01:09.240]  props if you will
[02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:13.320]  they're what makes this possible to the average person but what's going on
[02:01:13.320 --> 02:01:15.360]  it's a good old-fashioned military
[02:01:15.360 --> 02:01:16.000]  cool
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:17.600]  now the question is will it be
[02:01:17.600 --> 02:01:21.800]  sulliman the cia contact man ruling alone
[02:01:21.800 --> 02:01:24.080]  or would it be a military honda
[02:01:24.080 --> 02:01:27.600]  which would include this guy can't tell me the defense minister
[02:01:27.600 --> 02:01:30.360]  and the chief of staff of the armed forces general
[02:01:30.360 --> 02:01:32.400]  a non-so this is uh...
[02:01:32.400 --> 02:01:35.720]  again a military pooch now the big issue is why
[02:01:35.720 --> 02:01:39.480]  and more research reveals why move barack had been fighting the u.s. on many
[02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:40.400]  issues
[02:01:40.400 --> 02:01:44.200]  uh... in this in the august of two thousand nine the u.s. had demanded
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:49.520]  a u.s. nuclear umbrella for israel Egypt the Saudis and the emirates of the
[02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:52.840]  gulf all against iran this would be to create that
[02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:53.600]  arab
[02:01:53.600 --> 02:01:54.640]  so many
[02:01:54.640 --> 02:01:57.120]  and israel and u.s. front
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:00.960]  against iranians and will barack said no he rejected it he said i will not
[02:02:00.960 --> 02:02:02.560]  normalize with israel
[02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:05.080]  unless i negotiate directly with them and get
[02:02:05.080 --> 02:02:09.200]  certain things in return and that encouraged the Saudis to also say no
[02:02:09.200 --> 02:02:12.280]  there's also a conflict about what's going to happen in lebanon
[02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:16.400]  mubarak has been saying i don't want the future of lebanon determined by this
[02:02:16.400 --> 02:02:17.680]  fake report
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:20.520]  of this uh... hope that united nations
[02:02:20.520 --> 02:02:24.520]  uh... commission which is is corrupt as the day is long because the future of
[02:02:24.520 --> 02:02:26.600]  lebanon should not depend on some
[02:02:26.600 --> 02:02:27.640]  outside
[02:02:27.640 --> 02:02:29.080]  uh... committee and
[02:02:29.080 --> 02:02:33.240]  the last conversation that i can find between obama and mubarak january
[02:02:33.240 --> 02:02:34.640]  nineteen
[02:02:34.640 --> 02:02:35.280]  uh...
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:38.080]  obama calls mubarak and thank them
[02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:40.640]  for supporting the commission which was a pretty
[02:02:40.640 --> 02:02:42.360]  heavy-handed uh...
[02:02:42.360 --> 02:02:45.800]  uh... warning i guess because it's clear that mubarak is not supporting the
[02:02:45.800 --> 02:02:46.680]  commission
[02:02:46.680 --> 02:02:50.960]  uh... district record goes way back in in late two thousand six uh... mubarak
[02:02:50.960 --> 02:02:54.240]  was saying it's too soon for the u.s. to leave iraq
[02:02:54.240 --> 02:02:57.960]  stop leaving iraq uh... you're you're making me
[02:02:57.960 --> 02:03:02.080]  uh... you know uh... let's secure the general idea is that mubarak wants the
[02:03:02.080 --> 02:03:03.560]  status quo
[02:03:03.560 --> 02:03:07.760]  unless changes in the status quo benefit so he's like a real fox fell in three
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:10.400]  years ago he doesn't want world war three he's a butcher he's a
[02:03:10.400 --> 02:03:11.280]  thug
[02:03:11.280 --> 02:03:12.560]  he's a torture
[02:03:12.560 --> 02:03:15.400]  but he wouldn't get in line for world war three
[02:03:15.400 --> 02:03:18.320]  and the uh... strategic attacks uh... on
[02:03:18.320 --> 02:03:19.920]  iran and so
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:23.760]  they're sending a message to jordan they're sending a message to saudi arabia
[02:03:23.760 --> 02:03:24.920]  they're sending a message
[02:03:24.920 --> 02:03:28.720]  to yemen to everybody else you do what we say are we will trigger your
[02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:30.400]  overthrows right now
[02:03:30.400 --> 02:03:34.520]  yes and the result is now that that the attack on iran comes closer that's the
[02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:36.400]  wonderful thing in tomorrow's
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:37.720]  out of all of these young
[02:03:37.720 --> 02:03:42.360]  young dukes in the square what they have done is if this happens that if this
[02:03:42.360 --> 02:03:44.040]  goes through because it may not
[02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:45.840]  and that it may be talking to his hat
[02:03:45.840 --> 02:03:48.040]  and the networks may be talking to their hat
[02:03:48.040 --> 02:03:49.880]  but if this goes through
[02:03:49.880 --> 02:03:54.400]  the war with iran becomes easier because egypt is eliminated as somebody
[02:03:54.400 --> 02:03:55.400]  saying no
[02:03:55.400 --> 02:03:56.800]  we're not interested
[02:03:56.800 --> 02:03:59.600]  the saudi at that point may cave
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:01.320]  and at that point you've got
[02:04:01.320 --> 02:04:02.920]  pretty much a clear path
[02:04:02.920 --> 02:04:06.480]  to have the war with iran so that's the one where i gotta stop because we're
[02:04:06.480 --> 02:04:10.400]  out of time listen this is so important but i have a guest already scheduled in
[02:04:10.400 --> 02:04:13.200]  studio and i concur with your analysis
[02:04:13.200 --> 02:04:16.640]  plus it's now admitted as you said with panetta and the previous that the
[02:04:16.640 --> 02:04:19.120]  u.s. interest were funding this that we need to do
[02:04:19.120 --> 02:04:22.400]  twenty minutes on this but i know you may have other things scheduled
[02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:24.960]  can you come back with us in fifty five minutes
[02:04:24.960 --> 02:04:28.240]  for twenty minutes to really take your time whatever you need sure
[02:04:28.240 --> 02:04:30.640]  okay we will go on whatever is more convenient
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:35.120]  we will call you in fifty five minutes and we'll do two segments
[02:04:35.120 --> 02:04:38.800]  where you can from the beginning you know read the actual quotes of panetta
[02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:41.840]  the london telegraph three weeks ago saying the u.s. was doing this
[02:04:41.840 --> 02:04:44.640]  and and and what this signifies
[02:04:44.640 --> 02:04:47.760]  that panetta would announce they're about to fall and then and then it's
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:51.760]  announced this is unbelievable meanwhile glenn becks claiming that
[02:04:51.760 --> 02:04:55.280]  george soros is running all this and in certain levels i guess he is
[02:04:55.280 --> 02:04:58.240]  will break all that down with you coming up fifty five minutes
[02:04:58.240 --> 02:05:01.280]  steward rose is straight ahead websher stand by
[02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:04.880]  alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over
[02:05:04.880 --> 02:05:09.120]  it ended on june of two thousand nine the millions of americans unable to find
[02:05:09.120 --> 02:05:12.800]  work might not agree perhaps a recession ended for the bankers
[02:05:12.800 --> 02:05:14.880]  and government employees but for the rest of us
[02:05:14.880 --> 02:05:18.720]  things seem to be getting worse gold and silver haven't heard the news either

[02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:37.840]  be stepping down the head of the cia said early this morning in an
[02:08:37.840 --> 02:08:41.600]  intelligence public meeting then it was announced that mubarak would be
[02:08:41.600 --> 02:08:45.280]  stepping down why would our government be kicking out their own
[02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:48.080]  dictator and trying to put in the muslim brotherhood
[02:08:48.080 --> 02:08:50.720]  who say break your treaties with israel because they're getting ready to
[02:08:50.720 --> 02:08:54.240]  destabilize the middle east and try to kick off world war three as the ran
[02:08:54.240 --> 02:08:57.120]  corporation reported two years ago and we warned you
[02:08:57.120 --> 02:09:03.360]  okay this is serious serious serious the globalist run the radical muslims
[02:09:03.360 --> 02:09:06.880]  they're saying and we're all a lock he is set to hit us any day that the terror
[02:09:06.880 --> 02:09:10.000]  threat is as high as it's ever been since 9 11 that's because they didn't
[02:09:10.000 --> 02:09:14.560]  reauthorize the patriot act yesterday or two days ago the politano
[02:09:14.560 --> 02:09:17.440]  the head of homeland security responds saying he's going to hit us
[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:22.080]  but fox news and ap report headline and we're all a lock he dined secretly
[02:09:22.080 --> 02:09:26.400]  at the pentagon two months after 9 11 when he is known as
[02:09:26.400 --> 02:09:30.880]  the number three in al qaeda now cbs is saying and homeland security saying he's
[02:09:30.880 --> 02:09:35.520]  now number one replacing him as the new bin laden
[02:09:35.520 --> 02:09:39.040]  it turns out he was running the ford hood shooting the time square attack the
[02:09:39.040 --> 02:09:41.600]  underwear bombing the shoe bombing they admit all that
[02:09:41.600 --> 02:09:44.080]  and then it's admitted the state department helped him get on the plane
[02:09:44.080 --> 02:09:47.040]  they are running this out in the open and they're getting ready
[02:09:47.040 --> 02:09:50.400]  that's why they've told the cops for two years get ready for ied attacks
[02:09:50.400 --> 02:09:54.160]  get ready for a machine gun attacks on police stations
[02:09:54.160 --> 02:09:58.320]  to get the police fully behind martial law they're they're they're preparing
[02:09:58.320 --> 02:10:02.720]  low intensity attacks all over the country and this new model is not the
[02:10:02.720 --> 02:10:06.880]  government purely staging attacks it's going out and finding lunatics
[02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:09.920]  generally uh people who weren't originally arab
[02:10:09.920 --> 02:10:12.560]  people with names you know like johnson or martinis
[02:10:12.560 --> 02:10:16.000]  who who who they profile is complete lunatics and then they give them the
[02:10:16.000 --> 02:10:21.440]  weapons the bombs and say go at it and so that's the one good news is
[02:10:21.440 --> 02:10:24.960]  these people are such low-level operators mentally
[02:10:24.960 --> 02:10:27.920]  that they usually can't even point a gun properly and fire it
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:31.120]  or can't even get the you know the the bombs planted
[02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:34.320]  uh so we've we've analyzed this attack profile
[02:10:34.320 --> 02:10:38.480]  it's very serious uh and i told you yesterday they were about to announce
[02:10:38.480 --> 02:10:41.200]  a lock he's going to get you and they're now doing that i want to talk about
[02:10:41.200 --> 02:10:46.160]  that first with steward rode's uh he joins us here he is the founder
[02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:50.400]  of course of oathkeepers steward rode's the founder of
[02:10:50.400 --> 02:10:53.200]  oathkeepers he served in the u.s army paratrooper till disabled in a rough
[02:10:53.200 --> 02:10:55.680]  terrain parachuting accident during a nightjump
[02:10:55.680 --> 02:11:00.080]  he's a former firearms instructor and former member of ron paul's dc staff
[02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:04.000]  steward currently writes a monthly enemy at the gates column for swat magazine
[02:11:04.000 --> 02:11:08.240]  he graduated from Yale law school uh where his paper solving the puzzle of
[02:11:08.240 --> 02:11:12.160]  enemy combatant status one yells miller prize for best paper in bill of
[02:11:12.160 --> 02:11:14.960]  rights he assisted teaching u.s military history at
[02:11:14.960 --> 02:11:18.160]  Yale was a Yale research scholar and is writing a book on the dangers of
[02:11:18.160 --> 02:11:21.040]  applying the laws of war to the american people and he heads up
[02:11:21.040 --> 02:11:23.920]  oathkeeper steward for those that don't know who you are tell them briefly about
[02:11:23.920 --> 02:11:26.960]  oathkeepers then break down what i was just talking about
[02:11:26.960 --> 02:11:29.840]  i've confirmed through multiple military sources plus we have public
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:33.200]  admissions they are training national guard state guard regular army
[02:11:33.200 --> 02:11:37.520]  marines to set up checkpoints run ids and put people on army trucks
[02:11:37.520 --> 02:11:40.720]  they're announcing the eas system will start having government announcements
[02:11:40.720 --> 02:11:44.240]  at 9 000 locations government telescreens are going in saying watch your
[02:11:44.240 --> 02:11:48.560]  neighbors we are entering 1984 uh break down what you think's happening
[02:11:48.560 --> 02:11:51.120]  well the mission of oathkeepers is to remind the current serving of their
[02:11:51.120 --> 02:11:54.560]  oath to support and defend the constitution and to stand down and
[02:11:54.560 --> 02:11:57.840]  refuse unlawful orders because tyranny can't come without their
[02:11:57.840 --> 02:12:01.360]  cooperation as we just saw in tenicia when the military was
[02:12:01.360 --> 02:12:05.840]  withdraws its consent and cooperation the dictator truly has no clothes and can
[02:12:05.840 --> 02:12:08.800]  do nothing and so our our goal here in the u.s is to
[02:12:08.800 --> 02:12:12.480]  prevent it from happening in the first place as a preemptive refusal as we
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:15.040]  saw during katrina we had one national guard unit from
[02:12:15.040 --> 02:12:19.120]  utah at least one unit who stood down refused to go along with disarmament
[02:12:19.120 --> 02:12:22.560]  of the american people in katrina and so that's what we're trying to do
[02:12:22.560 --> 02:12:26.080]  but there is a pattern as you said they're being trained and being prepared
[02:12:26.080 --> 02:12:29.200]  for economic collapse in particular they're being told
[02:12:29.200 --> 02:12:32.320]  that they're that this is coming and they're training appearing for it but
[02:12:32.320 --> 02:12:34.480]  they're not preparing the american people that's what your tens of thousands
[02:12:34.480 --> 02:12:37.120]  of contacts are confirming for you that's right so we're hearing that from
[02:12:37.120 --> 02:12:39.680]  different places you know from places you're from one guy it's
[02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:42.880]  scuttle but but you hear from eight nine different places little pings coming
[02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:45.360]  in saying the same thing they know a collapse is coming
[02:12:45.360 --> 02:12:48.000]  they're getting ready for it but they're not preparing the american people
[02:12:48.000 --> 02:12:51.920]  they're preparing to control the american people big difference
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:55.280]  and then the people in many respects will beg for order
[02:12:55.280 --> 02:12:58.880]  just like they are in the triggered events in egypt uh and then that will
[02:12:58.880 --> 02:13:01.040]  set the precedent for even more control
[02:13:01.040 --> 02:13:04.080]  and the checkpoints run by the tsa on the streets of america
[02:13:04.080 --> 02:13:07.200]  and that's all announced two years ago in tennessee it's in my new film police
[02:13:07.200 --> 02:13:10.160]  state four rise of fema the governor said stop running
[02:13:10.160 --> 02:13:13.440]  homeland security multi jurisdictional army marines
[02:13:13.440 --> 02:13:17.760]  uh fbi shutting down highways uh and now they're rolling
[02:13:17.760 --> 02:13:20.640]  out even more and they said governor we're going to do what we want under the
[02:13:20.640 --> 02:13:25.280]  john warner defense authorization act that states and it's the precursor to
[02:13:25.280 --> 02:13:29.440]  the ten-member governor's council that supersedes the uh state sovereignty
[02:13:29.440 --> 02:13:32.960]  fraudulently and they said under the john warner act
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:36.240]  we're operating and you're now and not in the loop i mean we're already seeing
[02:13:36.240 --> 02:13:39.600]  federal occupation they just haven't run the flag up yet
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:42.400]  that's what's happened to us as a country they've weakened the states we no longer
[02:13:42.400 --> 02:13:45.680]  have a militia of the people we no longer have our own security in our
[02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:48.800]  own hands and they've created a power vacuum what's left of our national
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:52.400]  national guard is what's left of the militia is now sent overseas and they
[02:13:52.400 --> 02:13:55.920]  replace that with north com and fema like you just said in the council of ten
[02:13:55.920 --> 02:13:59.600]  governors is a direct circumvention of article four section four
[02:13:59.600 --> 02:14:03.040]  which requires that they get permission for the legislature and the governor
[02:14:03.040 --> 02:14:05.920]  before they come into a state they're acting as though that doesn't exist
[02:14:05.920 --> 02:14:09.200]  and all they do is go to this council of ten stuges and get their
[02:14:09.200 --> 02:14:12.400]  get their rubber stamp of approval and now tsa's at the super bowl running the
[02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:15.680]  hands down the pants now the telescreens now they're running x-ray
[02:14:15.680 --> 02:14:18.160]  checkpoints in the middle of the country this is the beta test
[02:14:18.160 --> 02:14:22.800]  acclimation rollout and i just said earlier if we have a woman of an economic collapse
[02:14:22.800 --> 02:14:26.800]  if we are not prepared as a people in our local communities and we're not strong
[02:14:26.800 --> 02:14:29.920]  and able to stand upon our own then people will be desperate and more
[02:14:29.920 --> 02:14:33.600]  likely to go along with martial law and the military and police will also be
[02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:36.960]  more likely to go along with it because in their eyes it'll be a real emergency
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:40.960]  that's why we have to as a people and this is our whole the whole focus of our
[02:14:40.960 --> 02:14:44.160]  new initiative preemptively warn people so they know it's coming so we have
[02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:48.640]  credibility and get patriots as a remnant in position to rebuild the country
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:51.920]  we'll get them ready ahead of time we should be restoring institutions we
[02:14:51.920 --> 02:14:55.840]  have allowed to let atrophy chief among them being the militia of the people
[02:14:55.840 --> 02:15:00.320]  our sheriff's posseys and the adl's upset because several states are moving to
[02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:04.240]  reignite and establish the state militia that's right they don't want to say
[02:15:04.240 --> 02:15:06.640]  this happened even in montana right now a simple
[02:15:06.640 --> 02:15:10.160]  home guard bill has been opposed by the state version
[02:15:10.160 --> 02:15:14.320]  of the splc in montana they're saying the state can't even be trusted to have it some people
[02:15:14.320 --> 02:15:17.040]  right they call a paramilitary organization they don't want the state to
[02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:20.000]  have any kind of power the military power is supposed to be
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:23.760]  with us the people that was the answer to the ancient question of who should guard
[02:15:23.760 --> 02:15:26.960]  the guardians the founders intended us to be our own guardians
[02:15:26.960 --> 02:15:30.640]  and we are the sovereigns that's right and so you know and we are safe we can't
[02:15:30.640 --> 02:15:34.080]  oppress ourselves they can't make us oppress ourselves so that's what they
[02:15:34.080 --> 02:15:37.440]  want to gut the states and they have and weaken the people so that we are
[02:15:37.440 --> 02:15:40.800]  desperate in destitute when an emergency happens and they can bring in
[02:15:40.800 --> 02:15:44.480]  standing army troops and and even potentially foreign troops all right
[02:15:44.480 --> 02:15:47.360]  tell us about your new initiative to counter this and in the intelligence
[02:15:47.360 --> 02:15:50.960]  you're getting from all of your members and others around the world's door
[02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:54.320]  well the main focus is is to wake the veterans up to their responsibility
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:57.200]  under their oath that it's not enough just to vote
[02:15:57.200 --> 02:16:00.160]  it's not enough to say to the current serving don't violate our rights the
[02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:04.000]  veterans have to go out there and re-establish institutions we have let
[02:16:04.000 --> 02:16:08.320]  after we have to fill the vacuum we have to occupy as the rightful occupiers of
[02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:11.840]  our country instead of these foreign bankers with this federal gaggle
[02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:14.560]  occupying us that's right and sound money is an important part of that
[02:16:14.560 --> 02:16:18.160]  there's a new initiative called the alternate market movement being started
[02:16:18.160 --> 02:16:22.000]  by neither core press we're working with them to help and support them and max
[02:16:22.000 --> 02:16:25.120]  kaiser when he said a little while ago is absolutely correct we'll start pushing
[02:16:25.120 --> 02:16:28.640]  a lot of his material as well and the whole goal is to get people across the
[02:16:28.640 --> 02:16:31.840]  country to disconnect from the fiat system you know
[02:16:31.840 --> 02:16:35.840]  decouple from the dollar the rest of the world already is anyway so we should do
[02:16:35.840 --> 02:16:39.680]  decouple from the fiat system unplug from the matrix and rebuild
[02:16:39.680 --> 02:16:45.200]  sovereign communities at the local so warm up the states for the confrontation
[02:16:45.200 --> 02:16:48.400]  with the illegitimate federal governments we can hopefully peacefully
[02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:51.440]  operate through the tenth amendment powers disconnect because if we just sit
[02:16:51.440 --> 02:16:54.560]  here under the fiat system and when it collapses on our heads we can't think
[02:16:54.560 --> 02:16:56.800]  we're going to be able to climb out of the rubble and rebuild because they have
[02:16:56.800 --> 02:17:00.880]  another super system as as max said a world fed is what they have planned
[02:17:00.880 --> 02:17:03.440]  next we got to get from out from under the fiat system
[02:17:03.440 --> 02:17:07.040]  get back to the foundation of a free republic the founders left us
[02:17:07.040 --> 02:17:10.640]  that we've allowed to to kill and we're not the revolutionaries we're the
[02:17:10.640 --> 02:17:13.120]  restorationists the globalists of the revolutionaries
[02:17:13.120 --> 02:17:16.080]  we want to restore the republic exactly the way to do it is get out from
[02:17:16.080 --> 02:17:18.880]  underneath the fall system and get back to what the founders gave us
[02:17:18.880 --> 02:17:22.880]  which is county sovereign counties and sovereign states and resilient
[02:17:22.880 --> 02:17:27.280]  communities economically militarily with your communications make sure you
[02:17:27.280 --> 02:17:30.400]  have alternate communications when they pull the plug on the internet here as
[02:17:30.400 --> 02:17:33.840]  we saw in egypt that we won't care what did fema do
[02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:36.960]  in katrina and the police had to guard they went in and hacked down their
[02:17:36.960 --> 02:17:39.280]  communications people said well the cops aren't on duty
[02:17:39.280 --> 02:17:43.760]  fema had cut all their lines to then do a beta test of a takeover
[02:17:43.760 --> 02:17:46.720]  right and so the sheriff there posted armed guards to stop him from doing it
[02:17:46.720 --> 02:17:50.480]  again and reconnected the lines so that's right so we have to as a community
[02:17:50.480 --> 02:17:53.920]  as in all local communities and this is both in the public sphere and the
[02:17:53.920 --> 02:17:57.840]  private sphere work to get your county to establish a real county militia but
[02:17:57.840 --> 02:18:01.280]  don't wait for that to happen while it's while you're doing that also
[02:18:01.280 --> 02:18:04.480]  go start a neighborhood watch and make sure that you have mutual aid and
[02:18:04.480 --> 02:18:07.840]  support among private citizens as well the two-pillar approach yeah they're
[02:18:07.840 --> 02:18:10.960]  trying to roll out their federal neighborhood watch to see something say
[02:18:10.960 --> 02:18:13.520]  something so you what you're saying is actually
[02:18:13.520 --> 02:18:17.040]  join those but join local ones so our people fill those spots
[02:18:17.040 --> 02:18:20.400]  start your watch among your neighbors make sure that you a totally private
[02:18:20.400 --> 02:18:22.560]  one exact should people join the see something say
[02:18:22.560 --> 02:18:24.960]  something to have it uh no i don't think so okay yeah
[02:18:24.960 --> 02:18:28.480]  yeah state level only forget about the feds you do what you're supposed to do
[02:18:28.480 --> 02:18:31.360]  in your county but it would be valuable to have some of our people in there
[02:18:31.360 --> 02:18:35.200]  um yeah i suppose so but but the main focus is is on in your own neighborhoods
[02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:38.960]  in your own state so i would focus there uh we're going to break and i want you
[02:18:38.960 --> 02:18:41.840]  to have the floor and go through all those lists and give out the website and
[02:18:41.840 --> 02:18:44.080]  a lot more it's so exciting to have you here in studio
[02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:48.320]  but briefly last time you were here you said that the awakening of police and
[02:18:48.320 --> 02:18:51.520]  military is exponential what's your report briefly on that
[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:55.920]  well the worried about it i mean teneza is a wonderful example of the right way
[02:18:55.920 --> 02:18:58.560]  to do it the military did not pull a coup the
[02:18:58.560 --> 02:19:02.480]  military did not shoot the people they simply stood down it's a wonderful
[02:19:02.480 --> 02:19:05.600]  example and i think that that meme that example is
[02:19:05.600 --> 02:19:10.640]  going to spread so the answer is uh follow the
[02:19:10.640 --> 02:19:13.280]  constitution and bella writes and they'll never have to
[02:19:13.280 --> 02:19:16.640]  even think about it i mean just if they follow that that's it they can't do it
[02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:20.000]  yeah it's game over for that they can't do without them so but we can't just sit
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:23.600]  and wait for the for them to do the right thing we also have to make sure that
[02:19:23.600 --> 02:19:27.280]  we are resilient so when the collapse comes we're not desperate because
[02:19:27.280 --> 02:19:30.800]  otherwise we'll we'll take the fema card the new currency you probably come in
[02:19:30.800 --> 02:19:33.760]  the form of a fema card you know here's your new digital yeah
[02:19:33.760 --> 02:19:38.720]  so we we can't be dependent upon that we must disconnect and rebuild
[02:19:38.720 --> 02:19:42.960]  sound money systems food food independence and economic independence as
[02:19:42.960 --> 02:19:45.920]  well all right we're going to break run and come back and go through this new
[02:19:45.920 --> 02:19:49.760]  huge initiative you guys are launching and it's up to you out there
[02:19:49.760 --> 02:19:52.560]  uh to get the ball and start carrying in on this
[02:19:52.560 --> 02:19:56.320]  resistance is victory if you take action we have the truth
[02:19:56.320 --> 02:20:01.200]  on our side you are unstoppable but it's up to you look in the mirror
[02:20:01.200 --> 02:20:04.400]  this is alex jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[02:20:04.400 --> 02:20:08.400]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:20:08.400 --> 02:20:12.160]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[02:20:12.160 --> 02:20:15.760]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[02:20:15.760 --> 02:20:20.000]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:20:20.000 --> 02:20:24.400]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid
[02:20:24.400 --> 02:20:28.080]  is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:20:28.080 --> 02:20:31.920]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:20:31.920 --> 02:20:35.120]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[02:20:35.120 --> 02:20:39.040]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator

[02:24:09.040 --> 02:24:12.400]  launching at the oak keepers website then we're going to get into it we're
[02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:17.360]  telling me during the break about this really ron paul type
[02:24:17.360 --> 02:24:21.120]  constitutional rebellion at the state level through the legislatures
[02:24:21.120 --> 02:24:24.320]  people are really starting to get it so exciting things happening but break
[02:24:24.320 --> 02:24:27.680]  down your new initiative well the whole focus here is the do for the for the
[02:24:27.680 --> 02:24:31.360]  veterans what we did for the current serving to get them to understand their
[02:24:31.360 --> 02:24:34.720]  personal obligation to rebuild the republic under their oath they can't
[02:24:34.720 --> 02:24:37.280]  just vote they can't just sit on the couch and say i hope no one
[02:24:37.280 --> 02:24:40.800]  violates my rights they got to get out there and resurrect and frankly it's
[02:24:40.800 --> 02:24:42.960]  our own fault we're in the position we're in now
[02:24:42.960 --> 02:24:46.240]  i told like one veterans gathering i said look you should get down any knees
[02:24:46.240 --> 02:24:49.680]  and beg forgiveness for your neglected negligence and so we're going to wake
[02:24:49.680 --> 02:24:53.440]  them up get them off the bar stool so not just sitting around drinking beers
[02:24:53.440 --> 02:24:57.120]  we're going to reactivate them make them realize they still have a mission
[02:24:57.120 --> 02:24:59.680]  under their oath they must rebuild the republic because we're going to be
[02:24:59.680 --> 02:25:03.600]  focusing on the ultimate market movement focusing on revitalizing the
[02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:07.200]  public militia at the county level i'm talking about a real public institution
[02:25:07.200 --> 02:25:09.920]  like you have a volunteer fire department that's that's established by the
[02:25:09.920 --> 02:25:12.800]  county but stacked by volunteers same thing here
[02:25:12.800 --> 02:25:16.240]  and also at the state level as well and forming sheriff's posse's and i want to
[02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:20.160]  go to every vfw hall an american legion hall and marine corps league hall and
[02:25:20.160 --> 02:25:23.920]  say look you guys get your own grain reserves used to be in this country we
[02:25:23.920 --> 02:25:27.520]  had three years of grain reserves for the people during the cold war now we
[02:25:27.520 --> 02:25:31.200]  have enough to give all of us one half of loaf of bread that's it
[02:25:31.200 --> 02:25:34.000]  and so we have to build up our own grain reserves all these veterans
[02:25:34.000 --> 02:25:37.360]  organizations they should be inside their own organizations getting food
[02:25:37.360 --> 02:25:40.000]  stores globalism has worked hard to make sure
[02:25:40.000 --> 02:25:43.920]  we're dependent on them for a long time exactly so we got to rebuild it it's
[02:25:43.920 --> 02:25:46.480]  like it's like it's kind of like a pyramid like this the power is supposed
[02:25:46.480 --> 02:25:49.520]  to be at the very bottom the strength and power is supposed to be at the bottom
[02:25:49.520 --> 02:25:52.880]  of the of the republic and only at the top is very little bit of power they've
[02:25:52.880 --> 02:25:56.880]  turned it on its head they have a very weak states now and weak people and a
[02:25:56.880 --> 02:26:00.880]  powerful top-down system over the top of us we got to reverse that flip it back
[02:26:00.880 --> 02:26:04.880]  over again continuing with this initiative and give
[02:26:04.880 --> 02:26:08.720]  folks the website oathkeepers.org and we're going to be calling this
[02:26:08.720 --> 02:26:11.760]  operation reactivate so that's going to be the
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:15.360]  name of it actually Rob do your producer that was his idea
[02:26:15.360 --> 02:26:18.880]  so i want to thank Rob for that wow it's great so reactivating them in their
[02:26:18.880 --> 02:26:22.800]  oath realizing that look you know my service is not done
[02:26:22.800 --> 02:26:26.160]  i have to get off the bar still get off the couch and get back out there and do
[02:26:26.160 --> 02:26:28.800]  it and if we can wake the veterans up they will
[02:26:28.800 --> 02:26:31.680]  leave the rest of the people in this country to do what's right
[02:26:31.680 --> 02:26:35.280]  well i'll tell you the really big jump we've got on the controllers is that
[02:26:35.280 --> 02:26:40.160]  ron paul 35 years ago my shelf 16 17 years ago
[02:26:40.160 --> 02:26:44.240]  countless other people jeover griffin the list goes on and on new history knew
[02:26:44.240 --> 02:26:47.520]  who the globalists were read their own reports that were public
[02:26:47.520 --> 02:26:51.200]  understood what was happening warned people got laughed at for a long time
[02:26:51.200 --> 02:26:54.960]  now we're not getting laughed at to the point of this stuff so mainstream glen
[02:26:54.960 --> 02:26:58.480]  becks there's a world government they're coming for everything you know he's
[02:26:58.480 --> 02:27:02.160]  telling the truth on more and more because we're dragging fox news
[02:27:02.160 --> 02:27:06.000]  over to at least have to act like true patriots to even stay relevant
[02:27:06.000 --> 02:27:09.200]  and they have more viewers and all the other cable stations combined
[02:27:09.200 --> 02:27:14.480]  because they'll at least carry you on a little bit of our political
[02:27:14.480 --> 02:27:18.960]  coloration was max kind of said earlier it's out in the open now special drying
[02:27:18.960 --> 02:27:21.680]  rights can be the new basis for the new world currency
[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:24.400]  they're telling us what they're going to do it's not conspiracy theory anymore
[02:27:24.400 --> 02:27:27.600]  we got the jump on them by warning people absolutely so now they're just
[02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:30.080]  being proven correct and as i was talking about earlier
[02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:33.280]  you know there's we've seen this way we talked earlier about a wave
[02:27:33.280 --> 02:27:37.120]  after effect of the ron paul campaign we're starting to see that now in the
[02:27:37.120 --> 02:27:40.880]  house in the houses and sentence of the states we just had a big meeting in
[02:27:40.880 --> 02:27:43.840]  montana oath to respond to the meeting while the different liberty groups came
[02:27:43.840 --> 02:27:46.960]  together uh... nine twelveers tea party people campaign for liberty
[02:27:46.960 --> 02:27:50.080]  you name it and we had twenty state legislators there
[02:27:50.080 --> 02:27:54.240]  hardcore ron paul republican and a total takeover of one state by the people
[02:27:54.240 --> 02:27:57.680]  will then be used as a model for the rest that's right one domino falls
[02:27:57.680 --> 02:28:01.360]  victory is ours and amen to that exactly so you know
[02:28:01.360 --> 02:28:05.040]  if once they can do it and show how it's done you get one state to re-institute a
[02:28:05.040 --> 02:28:08.160]  state bank and do sound money like virginia starting to do
[02:28:08.160 --> 02:28:11.280]  and montana's and openly confront the globalist verbally
[02:28:11.280 --> 02:28:15.840]  they think exactly right call them out so they can do that and once we start
[02:28:15.840 --> 02:28:18.560]  doing that and people realize that hey the sky's not going to fall when i
[02:28:18.560 --> 02:28:22.240]  stand up and just act like a citizen again a sovereign
[02:28:22.240 --> 02:28:25.120]  said the sky's gonna fall if we don't
[02:28:25.120 --> 02:28:28.320]  absolutely it's gonna crumble we should we should accept the fact
[02:28:28.320 --> 02:28:32.240]  that dollars going to die it's going to collapse the question is
[02:28:32.240 --> 02:28:35.520]  are we gonna sit there and let it let it collapse on top of us or we're gonna
[02:28:35.520 --> 02:28:38.240]  rebuild we're supposed to have so that when it collapses
[02:28:38.240 --> 02:28:42.400]  we can assert our own future rather than having it imposed having their model
[02:28:42.400 --> 02:28:47.120]  imposed on us and that idea is wholesome it's the spirit of 1776 if we put our
[02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:51.440]  idea out against global bondage we're gonna win
[02:28:51.440 --> 02:28:54.240]  that's right so that they don't want to do anything that's why i tell you just
[02:28:54.240 --> 02:28:57.920]  go vote and otherwise leave it to us so you want to do what they don't want you
[02:28:57.920 --> 02:29:00.000]  to do so the public law center and the rest of the
[02:29:00.000 --> 02:29:03.200]  propaganda machine does not want you to start a shares posse
[02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:06.720]  or to revitalize the militia of your county so you should go do that whatever
[02:29:06.720 --> 02:29:09.840]  they don't want you to do that's what you should be doing well that's what i've
[02:29:09.840 --> 02:29:12.560]  always said anything the globalist are for i'm against
[02:29:12.560 --> 02:29:16.400]  and then if you analyze each point intellectually it's it whatever they want
[02:29:16.400 --> 02:29:19.200]  is not in our interest that's right it's the bizarre republic
[02:29:19.200 --> 02:29:22.640]  they're trying to impose the bizarre republic on us destroy our national
[02:29:22.640 --> 02:29:26.000]  sovereignty destroy our state sovereignty and then we have obama
[02:29:26.000 --> 02:29:30.560]  continuing the spp that bush started and trying to merge you know i
[02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:33.040]  that's been out for a few days and i should have covered it we knew it was
[02:29:33.040 --> 02:29:35.360]  already going on by stealth we'll cover that when we come back
[02:29:35.360 --> 02:29:39.040]  also the other incredible information you're getting from all your sources

[02:30:16.800 --> 02:30:21.200]  on our president in congress and they really are calling the shots i think
[02:30:21.200 --> 02:30:26.080]  it's incumbent upon all of us as american citizens to pay attention
[02:30:26.080 --> 02:30:29.280]  for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation
[02:30:29.280 --> 02:30:33.680]  the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty

[02:31:04.080 --> 02:31:08.160]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[02:31:08.160 --> 02:31:10.640]  double or triple your electric bill number two
[02:31:10.640 --> 02:31:14.480]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:31:14.480 --> 02:31:17.680]  allows you to have it's true total government control of
[02:31:17.680 --> 02:31:21.200]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[02:31:21.200 --> 02:31:24.880]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[02:31:24.880 --> 02:31:27.840]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[02:31:27.840 --> 02:31:31.760]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[02:31:31.760 --> 02:31:34.880]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[02:31:34.880 --> 02:31:38.800]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[02:31:38.800 --> 02:31:41.680]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[02:31:41.680 --> 02:31:44.720]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[02:31:44.720 --> 02:31:47.200]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get
[02:31:47.200 --> 02:31:50.880]  more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[02:32:35.600 --> 02:32:39.120]  biggest and most important prediction yet and it's a real eye opener

[02:33:09.360 --> 02:33:13.760]  leading up frontal assault on the lies of the new world order
[02:33:13.760 --> 02:33:29.600]  it's alex jones on the gcn radio network
[02:33:29.600 --> 02:33:32.800]  we were just talking about something really important during the break stewart
[02:33:32.800 --> 02:33:37.360]  was saying what's your real view on egypt and i said well it's like a tree
[02:33:37.360 --> 02:33:39.840]  that's leaning over somebody's house and they need to cut it
[02:33:39.840 --> 02:33:42.800]  so they choose the time before the next big storm comes
[02:33:42.800 --> 02:33:46.640]  and they go ahead and chop it down in a controlled burn basically
[02:33:46.640 --> 02:33:49.840]  uh and but we know panetta says mubarak will step down then the
[02:33:49.840 --> 02:33:52.960]  announcement is he'll step down the one in telegraph and others got the
[02:33:52.960 --> 02:33:57.200]  documents three weeks ago that they sent in alberi and others and and
[02:33:57.200 --> 02:34:00.080]  sources in the military their military obviously trained by the us
[02:34:00.080 --> 02:34:03.760]  and so get ready we're doing this because mubarak is a globalist but he
[02:34:03.760 --> 02:34:06.320]  didn't want to have world war three with iran
[02:34:06.320 --> 02:34:09.360]  and so now they're they're pulling this destabilization
[02:34:09.360 --> 02:34:12.720]  but uh glimb back saying it's socialist muslims doing it and
[02:34:12.720 --> 02:34:16.560]  that it's all george soros and that's one arm but no it's it's the globalist
[02:34:16.560 --> 02:34:20.320]  that run our country they're triggering this order out of chaos destabilization
[02:34:20.320 --> 02:34:23.040]  and i was saying that's why we need to point out we're
[02:34:23.040 --> 02:34:26.640]  restorationists we want to follow the law bill of rights constitution
[02:34:26.640 --> 02:34:30.160]  the revolution is globalism and nafta and gat
[02:34:30.160 --> 02:34:33.840]  and the north american union through spp and the new continental security
[02:34:33.840 --> 02:34:37.200]  perimeter that they've now officially uh put into place
[02:34:37.200 --> 02:34:40.640]  we're the ones that want to stop the chaos and the problem is the globalist
[02:34:40.640 --> 02:34:43.840]  know they're going to push us into chaos they're going to try to steer it maybe
[02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:47.200]  for a right-wing coup you don't know but but uh stewards
[02:34:47.200 --> 02:34:50.080]  said absolutely have you heard of operation clean sweep tell folks about
[02:34:50.080 --> 02:34:53.200]  that well unfortunately some people they could be well
[02:34:53.200 --> 02:34:57.680]  well-intended patriots are calling for essentially a military coup
[02:34:57.680 --> 02:35:01.200]  and that's as dangerous as any ursuping president trying to be
[02:35:01.200 --> 02:35:04.640]  ill-president for life military coup is coming from the frying pan into the
[02:35:04.640 --> 02:35:07.520]  fire you still wind up with a destruction of the constitution
[02:35:07.520 --> 02:35:10.560]  a destruction of the republic and the problem that that that they're doing
[02:35:10.560 --> 02:35:13.760]  is is they're looking at walk in dc and are ignoring the states
[02:35:13.760 --> 02:35:17.200]  the answer is in the states the answer is we the people take care of things
[02:35:17.200 --> 02:35:20.000]  peacefully the state stand up and have the moral courage
[02:35:20.000 --> 02:35:23.200]  and and start exposing them then the globalists
[02:35:23.200 --> 02:35:27.680]  will literally evaporate well if you if you give the people a false choice
[02:35:27.680 --> 02:35:32.800]  between submit to tyranny or turn to the generals to come in and do a
[02:35:32.800 --> 02:35:36.080]  military coup that's been the bane of republics throughout history since
[02:35:36.080 --> 02:35:39.120]  ancient rome they've gone back and forth look at third world countries this
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:42.320]  happened every month absolutely and so the founders genius is
[02:35:42.320 --> 02:35:46.560]  that if we just simply follow the oath and the military stands down and then
[02:35:46.560 --> 02:35:50.160]  the people in the states stand up and take care of it
[02:35:50.160 --> 02:35:54.080]  it's solved without having to resort to those two extreme yeah we want to go
[02:35:54.080 --> 02:35:57.120]  back to the constitution not to something new and even worse
[02:35:57.120 --> 02:36:00.960]  well or old and even worse you know a season crossing the rubicon this is the
[02:36:00.960 --> 02:36:03.440]  same kind of thing you look to the generals to save you
[02:36:03.440 --> 02:36:06.640]  and now you have a general in sunglasses doing his macarthur imitation
[02:36:06.640 --> 02:36:09.600]  running your life instead of a instead of an earth being president is it any
[02:36:09.600 --> 02:36:12.000]  better no it's same thing generally it's worse
[02:36:12.000 --> 02:36:15.040]  it generally it is you went with a pinochet or a franco
[02:36:15.040 --> 02:36:19.360]  some some bloody dictator so we have to get back to the constitution
[02:36:19.360 --> 02:36:22.320]  a lot of these folks i get messages all the time saying well you say you're not
[02:36:22.320 --> 02:36:23.920]  going to do something what are you going to do
[02:36:23.920 --> 02:36:26.800]  when's the military gonna march on washington dc and i say it's not their
[02:36:26.800 --> 02:36:30.560]  job it's your job that's right well i love these people that you know
[02:36:30.560 --> 02:36:33.680]  these keyboard commandos and send me emails and say you're not calling for
[02:36:33.680 --> 02:36:37.040]  violence you're a wimp a we found out most of the time those are provocateur
[02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:40.720]  feds uh but but but b look in the mirror i've
[02:36:40.720 --> 02:36:43.360]  done as much as i can look at what we've been able to do
[02:36:43.360 --> 02:36:46.960]  what about you don't always look for somebody else who's already standing up
[02:36:46.960 --> 02:36:50.160]  to do it for you you want the solution look in the mirror and look
[02:36:50.160 --> 02:36:53.680]  here's a beta test example i've been beating the drum for several years go to
[02:36:53.680 --> 02:36:55.920]  your city council point out read what's in sodium
[02:36:55.920 --> 02:36:59.440]  fluoride the other ingredients the bone cancer evidence the admissions now
[02:36:59.440 --> 02:37:01.200]  they're starting to take it out all over the place
[02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:03.520]  it suddenly it's collapsing the government came out a month ago and said
[02:37:03.520 --> 02:37:06.560]  okay we do want to take it out of the water we do want to stop using it as a
[02:37:06.560 --> 02:37:09.920]  pesticide uh you you have record numbers of folks
[02:37:09.920 --> 02:37:12.960]  not taking the flu vaccine because we had a revolution of just reading the
[02:37:12.960 --> 02:37:16.000]  insert it's all about you making daily choices
[02:37:16.000 --> 02:37:18.880]  there's not going to be some arnold schwarzenegger on a white horse
[02:37:18.880 --> 02:37:22.400]  riding in and and and you know sending obama to the gulag
[02:37:22.400 --> 02:37:26.800]  and everything's fixed obama's a front man this is a process of rediscovering
[02:37:26.800 --> 02:37:30.080]  the spirit of 1776 the bill of rights the constitution
[02:37:30.080 --> 02:37:33.440]  the declaration of independence that is our rightful
[02:37:33.440 --> 02:37:38.320]  uh property and and and it's it's the rightful document that
[02:37:38.320 --> 02:37:41.680]  basically states what's already inherently there
[02:37:41.680 --> 02:37:45.440]  exactly and and you here's the point i make the people all the time i say look
[02:37:45.440 --> 02:37:49.760]  what institution is is supposed to take care of domestic security
[02:37:49.760 --> 02:37:53.520]  not the standing army it's the militia repel invasions
[02:37:53.520 --> 02:37:57.440]  suppress insurrections and execute the laws of the union so if anyone's going
[02:37:57.440 --> 02:38:01.040]  to go and correct things it's going to be the people themselves
[02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:04.000]  as the militia well kennesaw georgia had one of the highest crime rates in georgia
[02:38:04.000 --> 02:38:07.680]  a bedroom community of uh Atlanta until in 89 they said everyone must
[02:38:07.680 --> 02:38:11.280]  own guns by law just like switzerland has and it has the lowest crime rate in the
[02:38:11.280 --> 02:38:14.080]  country within one year i mean it's it's simple
[02:38:14.080 --> 02:38:16.880]  uh you don't have a lot of home invasions in texas because people they don't
[02:38:16.880 --> 02:38:19.920]  break in like they do in new york here while you're there because they know
[02:38:19.920 --> 02:38:22.880]  they'll get killed it's real simple guns are the answer
[02:38:22.880 --> 02:38:26.320]  well also another way to look at this is is this way people always say well the
[02:38:26.320 --> 02:38:29.520]  militia is there as a final check out on on tyrannical government
[02:38:29.520 --> 02:38:33.200]  they're missing an important point the militia is first supposed to be
[02:38:33.200 --> 02:38:36.960]  to fill that vacuum so you're not relying on standing army troops
[02:38:36.960 --> 02:38:40.000]  and professional police you're relying on you and your neighbors
[02:38:40.000 --> 02:38:43.200]  then then that no longer you no longer have a situation where you need outside
[02:38:43.200 --> 02:38:46.640]  help you're independent and that prevents them from having to preach that's right
[02:38:46.640 --> 02:38:50.000]  in the first place we've had cities of hundreds of thousands of people up
[02:38:50.000 --> 02:38:53.760]  before 1900 even millions where the only police were there
[02:38:53.760 --> 02:38:58.080]  to respond to court orders to go out you know once people been found to commit
[02:38:58.080 --> 02:39:00.800]  crime and pick them up and take them into the court the constables the
[02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:04.560]  sheriff's deputies and people and now we've got cops i saw an article today
[02:39:04.560 --> 02:39:08.640]  where a guy's little jack russell terrier got out killed a raccoon in the
[02:39:08.640 --> 02:39:12.080]  backyard in a fight raccoons are mean and now they're charging him with animal
[02:39:12.080 --> 02:39:16.000]  cruelty any way to put charges on law abiding
[02:39:16.000 --> 02:39:19.600]  citizens that's another telltale sign of tyranny is when they criminalize
[02:39:19.600 --> 02:39:22.400]  everything and also nationalize the police
[02:39:22.400 --> 02:39:25.360]  so those two twin things are happening you've got you've like you said you've
[02:39:25.360 --> 02:39:29.440]  got a massive pile of laws and they don't tell the jury about the real power
[02:39:29.440 --> 02:39:32.880]  to to judge even in the face of the law and he quit
[02:39:32.880 --> 02:39:35.680]  i just got done with a hearing yesterday in front of the montana house
[02:39:35.680 --> 02:39:40.000]  about a jury a jury notification bill or a fully forming jury bill in montana
[02:39:40.000 --> 02:39:43.120]  very important part of our core responsibilities as citizens
[02:39:43.120 --> 02:39:47.920]  a last check on abuse is really the jury they judge the laws well the facts
[02:39:47.920 --> 02:39:50.800]  they can do whatever they want they're the judges that's a that's a historic
[02:39:50.800 --> 02:39:54.240]  reality in fact but the problem is is they're not even telling them about
[02:39:54.240 --> 02:39:57.360]  this and yesterday was it was really that's another veto on law
[02:39:57.360 --> 02:40:00.480]  is it doesn't even matter if it's the law the jury doesn't like it and thinks
[02:40:00.480 --> 02:40:03.200]  it's wrong what's being done or it's not being applied right nope
[02:40:03.200 --> 02:40:06.000]  that's right and it's a famous case for in the colonial area
[02:40:06.000 --> 02:40:10.160]  era of a publisher named zangler who was prosecuted for
[02:40:10.160 --> 02:40:13.840]  criticizing the governor of new york and he admitted he'd written an article
[02:40:13.840 --> 02:40:17.200]  critical of the governor and and the level laws back then
[02:40:17.200 --> 02:40:19.760]  even though it was truthful was still considered liable
[02:40:19.760 --> 02:40:24.000]  and what the jury refused to convict him even in the face of the obvious
[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:26.880]  you know he was guilty they still refused to convict him and that's this
[02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:30.240]  that's the start of our first amendment right to free pet free press and free
[02:40:30.240 --> 02:40:33.200]  speech protections in the first amendment got their start in a jury
[02:40:33.200 --> 02:40:37.040]  notification case so it's one more example of a core institution
[02:40:37.040 --> 02:40:40.720]  we've allowed to wither away and the government has co-opted it
[02:40:40.720 --> 02:40:44.800]  they've done that with grand juries as well uh let's get into
[02:40:44.800 --> 02:40:47.840]  what the globalists are doing they're simply conquering us
[02:40:47.840 --> 02:40:51.440]  by just announcing their powers and judicial watch four years ago
[02:40:51.440 --> 02:40:54.640]  sued and got the north american union documents that hadn't been made public
[02:40:54.640 --> 02:40:57.920]  and there were the thousands of pages of minutes we cover it in my film in game
[02:40:57.920 --> 02:41:01.280]  show screenshots of it the first thing at the spp meeting as they said
[02:41:01.280 --> 02:41:04.800]  a we got to keep the secret from the public we got to set up the continent
[02:41:04.800 --> 02:41:08.720]  continental security perimeter it can't even be the feds that respond much less
[02:41:08.720 --> 02:41:12.160]  the locals now from mexico to alaska it's
[02:41:12.160 --> 02:41:15.120]  going to be this international body and we're going to fund
[02:41:15.120 --> 02:41:18.480]  the uh this international body this this american union
[02:41:18.480 --> 02:41:21.920]  through highway taxes through the trans texas
[02:41:21.920 --> 02:41:26.800]  napis super highways and here's world net daily obama signature creates
[02:41:26.800 --> 02:41:31.200]  continental perimeter and it goes on move described as key step in advance
[02:41:31.200 --> 02:41:34.640]  of north american union i remember and it's in my film in game
[02:41:34.640 --> 02:41:38.480]  bush signing an agreement with merkel and the eu and buroso
[02:41:38.480 --> 02:41:42.880]  on the on the rose garden saying we're now merging the north american union
[02:41:42.880 --> 02:41:48.880]  with the eu in 2007 and no one even paid attention when it was on tv this is
[02:41:48.880 --> 02:41:53.520]  just like they celebrated in 2007 the 50th anniversary of the eu
[02:41:53.520 --> 02:41:56.160]  but they told people in europe it started in 2000
[02:41:56.160 --> 02:42:00.160]  they had signed the treaty of rome in 57 it was already in place then
[02:42:00.160 --> 02:42:03.040]  and they called you a conspiracy theorist reporting this out and now it's
[02:42:03.040 --> 02:42:06.480]  but you know it's coming much more out in the open and what happened to the eu
[02:42:06.480 --> 02:42:09.440]  and how that came about is exactly what's happening to us right now
[02:42:09.440 --> 02:42:12.800]  they start with a free trade area integration by stealth right
[02:42:12.800 --> 02:42:16.640]  absolutely you know incrementalism to free trade and then it goes to a common
[02:42:16.640 --> 02:42:19.040]  currency and then it goes to a common government
[02:42:19.040 --> 02:42:22.400]  and then you lose your sovereignty so the overturning laws have been
[02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:25.920]  around england for hundreds of years are now found to be you know um
[02:42:25.920 --> 02:42:28.400]  illegal i mean they're getting rid of their common law and they're saying
[02:42:28.400 --> 02:42:30.800]  we're going to have to get rid of some of our laws and adopt canadian and
[02:42:30.800 --> 02:42:35.040]  mexican law they're saying yeah okay so you know so this is
[02:42:35.040 --> 02:42:37.600]  you know we have to go that's what the four supreme court justice have said
[02:42:37.600 --> 02:42:41.120]  we've got to follow international law now not our own right they're trying to
[02:42:41.120 --> 02:42:44.480]  trying to graft on it under our system international law
[02:42:44.480 --> 02:42:48.960]  yeah i keep going over that well yeah this is just confirmation that obama
[02:42:48.960 --> 02:42:52.400]  is no different than bush and this has been the problem for the last
[02:42:52.400 --> 02:42:55.680]  you know four decades basically we've had presidents of both parties
[02:42:55.680 --> 02:42:58.320]  have continued to push the same agenda which is
[02:42:58.320 --> 02:43:02.000]  sacrificing our national sovereignty and also destroying state sovereignty
[02:43:02.000 --> 02:43:06.080]  and it's being done economically it's being done militarily north com is the
[02:43:06.080 --> 02:43:10.240]  northern command encompasses canada and mexico too not just the united so that's
[02:43:10.240 --> 02:43:12.720]  what they're saying north com runs this perimeter
[02:43:12.720 --> 02:43:17.360]  exactly so this is this is this is the integration of uh of military economics
[02:43:17.360 --> 02:43:21.520]  and eventually government and law all into one northern hemisphere
[02:43:21.520 --> 02:43:25.440]  block just like the eu and if people in europe are called conspiracy theorists
[02:43:25.440 --> 02:43:28.400]  and nuts when they saw what was coming to that what happened to them and it
[02:43:28.400 --> 02:43:30.880]  happened anyway so we got to get over this this uh
[02:43:30.880 --> 02:43:34.320]  worrying about being blamed or being labeled a conspiracy theorist
[02:43:34.320 --> 02:43:37.040]  you know it's right there well that's just a term they throw out to get people
[02:43:37.040 --> 02:43:40.160]  to not look at what you're saying they just say all conspiracy theory you're
[02:43:40.160 --> 02:43:43.440]  like you know i have the document right here no no don't look don't look or
[02:43:43.440 --> 02:43:47.200]  chill your speech they don't want you to talk about it so you self-censor oh
[02:43:47.200 --> 02:43:49.680]  yeah what do you think of the two-son thing they didn't just go over the
[02:43:49.680 --> 02:43:52.640]  second amendment for every attack on the second amendment there were two or three
[02:43:52.640 --> 02:43:56.000]  against the first amendment and making the congress people sit together and
[02:43:56.000 --> 02:44:00.160]  saying we can't criticize now you all this collective guilt and then it
[02:44:00.160 --> 02:44:04.160]  turns out he's a liberal drughead i think it's gonna blow up in their faces
[02:44:04.160 --> 02:44:06.800]  what they really did there is they they jumped the shark
[02:44:06.800 --> 02:44:10.160]  they they they demonized half the country they've already called half the
[02:44:10.160 --> 02:44:13.520]  country racist if you just hear the bomb all of a sudden you're a racist
[02:44:13.520 --> 02:44:15.920]  so even though i'm like i'm a quarter mexican you know hardly a
[02:44:15.920 --> 02:44:19.600]  hardly a white white supremacist but they they try to label you this or that
[02:44:19.600 --> 02:44:22.880]  and the same thing happened in the wake of the arizona shooting they tried to
[02:44:22.880 --> 02:44:26.160]  say this is all the fault of the political right the entire spectrum
[02:44:26.160 --> 02:44:28.720]  across the country half the country is to blame for this
[02:44:28.720 --> 02:44:32.880]  and all it does is is is take off that segment of the american population
[02:44:32.880 --> 02:44:36.960]  and make them wake up and realize that look i'm being demonized now
[02:44:36.960 --> 02:44:39.920]  not just that guy over there that talks on the radio they're telling they're
[02:44:39.920 --> 02:44:43.840]  saying that it confirms from them that this is a tyranny
[02:44:43.840 --> 02:44:46.640]  and it confirms for them the propaganda machine so now you know so southern
[02:44:46.640 --> 02:44:50.000]  party law center it's becoming less and less effective when they try to call
[02:44:50.000 --> 02:44:53.520]  me a racist or a crazy person or whatever or glenn beck because i call
[02:44:53.520 --> 02:44:58.000]  half the country crazy and racist and violent or you don't like
[02:44:58.000 --> 02:45:01.440]  healthcare you don't like black people that's obviously ridiculous
[02:45:01.440 --> 02:45:04.480]  yeah it is and it's pulling up in their face i think more people because of the
[02:45:04.480 --> 02:45:08.080]  internet especially they're starting to see the truth one drop of truth
[02:45:08.080 --> 02:45:13.440]  is an antidote to a bucket full of crap we've got about 15 minutes left with
[02:45:13.440 --> 02:45:16.640]  you i i i've i've had a lot of questions a lot
[02:45:16.640 --> 02:45:19.920]  issues what's most important for you right now what's important that you're
[02:45:19.920 --> 02:45:22.560]  hearing from your members and supporters what's going on with
[02:45:22.560 --> 02:45:26.000]  those keepers i think the most important thing is for people to recognize
[02:45:26.000 --> 02:45:31.120]  the illegitimacy of martial law and to rediscover the constitution's
[02:45:31.120 --> 02:45:35.200]  emergency provisions like calling forth the militia of the several states
[02:45:35.200 --> 02:45:38.640]  that's what you do to handle domestic you don't you don't rely they know the
[02:45:38.640 --> 02:45:41.920]  locale they're truly prepared not have you heard i've been trying to call
[02:45:41.920 --> 02:45:44.800]  homeland security for four days they won't answer the phone
[02:45:44.800 --> 02:45:47.840]  you know to test if i could report terrorism they won't answer the phone
[02:45:47.840 --> 02:45:51.440]  they probably know it's you no we've tried from other phones or they pass us
[02:45:51.440 --> 02:45:55.440]  around and say call locals and they won't talk to us so it's not about
[02:45:55.440 --> 02:45:57.840]  actually getting your information they don't want to know these are phone
[02:45:57.840 --> 02:46:01.200]  numbers they put on flyers you call and it just rings and rings
[02:46:01.200 --> 02:46:04.000]  so it's all about conditioning then yeah they're just out there scaring
[02:46:04.000 --> 02:46:07.440]  everybody knowing there's not any real terror that they don't promote
[02:46:07.440 --> 02:46:09.520]  so the biggest thing we're looking at well here's what they want to tell you
[02:46:09.520 --> 02:46:13.200]  about and this if you knew but there was a special forces um
[02:46:13.200 --> 02:46:17.440]  colonel who was tasked with giving training at fort steward georgia
[02:46:17.440 --> 02:46:21.280]  and the training he was was ordered to design was so offensive to him
[02:46:21.280 --> 02:46:24.400]  that he resigned his commission left the army no i didn't know tell us about it
[02:46:24.400 --> 02:46:27.520]  well this is this is where you had first infantry division i mean i mean a
[02:46:27.520 --> 02:46:31.520]  first combat brigade a third id that's the north com attached unit
[02:46:31.520 --> 02:46:34.560]  is stationed at fort steward george that's brigade homeland that's right so
[02:46:34.560 --> 02:46:37.840]  he was told to go there and conduct training and was so offensive to him
[02:46:37.840 --> 02:46:40.080]  we don't know what he was told to do because we haven't haven't been able to
[02:46:40.080 --> 02:46:43.680]  get a hold of him yet but i've been confirmed by by two former sf that this
[02:46:43.680 --> 02:46:48.080]  is an accurate story that he was found it's so objectionable
[02:46:48.080 --> 02:46:50.800]  what they told him to go train the troops to do that he resigned his
[02:46:50.800 --> 02:46:53.600]  commission and left the army well let me tell you separately i've confirmed
[02:46:53.600 --> 02:46:57.280]  what they're training the guard and in regular army liaisons attached i've
[02:46:57.280 --> 02:47:00.080]  confirmed they're training to set up checkpoints
[02:47:00.080 --> 02:47:03.760]  run ids uh license plate reading cameras already going in
[02:47:03.760 --> 02:47:07.280]  and they just pull you out and put you in vans trucks or buses i mean they are
[02:47:07.280 --> 02:47:10.560]  they're actually getting ready to four real red and blue list
[02:47:10.560 --> 02:47:13.360]  well that's what that's why you know from the very beginning two years ago
[02:47:13.360 --> 02:47:17.360]  um on our list of orders will not obey our orders to ran with the american
[02:47:17.360 --> 02:47:20.560]  people or to blockade cities or to go into a
[02:47:20.560 --> 02:47:23.680]  state with force unless they've been invited by the state legislature
[02:47:23.680 --> 02:47:26.640]  and so we want them the current serving to understand that there have to be
[02:47:26.640 --> 02:47:30.160]  some serious hard lines martial laws totally unconstitutional
[02:47:30.160 --> 02:47:33.920]  illegitimate nowhere in the constitution and it has no basis
[02:47:33.920 --> 02:47:38.000]  no moral force no legal force they should resist it it's an illegal order
[02:47:38.000 --> 02:47:40.880]  absolutely the most illegal order they can possibly be
[02:47:40.880 --> 02:47:44.400]  and this is the problem is they've tried to graft they are grafting the foreign
[02:47:44.400 --> 02:47:48.400]  laws of war onto our domestic laws which they're
[02:47:48.400 --> 02:47:51.840]  saying they can do the same thing here that they've done overseas to people
[02:47:51.840 --> 02:47:55.680]  in uh conquered conquered iraq or conquered afghanistan
[02:47:55.680 --> 02:47:58.400]  the their whole logic obama is now from the authority
[02:47:58.400 --> 02:48:02.080]  and the power to uh assassinate american citizens that he thinks are
[02:48:02.080 --> 02:48:04.960]  enemy combatants and he says he has he has the power to do this
[02:48:04.960 --> 02:48:08.880]  off a secret list that cannot be reviewed by the courts that is pure treason
[02:48:08.880 --> 02:48:12.240]  absolutely is it's making war on american people so that's how i define
[02:48:12.240 --> 02:48:16.160]  trees that is the purest form so so what they're doing he is tyranis but
[02:48:16.160 --> 02:48:19.360]  remember he's just the figurehead but he but through that office
[02:48:19.360 --> 02:48:26.160]  he he's he's preparing to try to to to deploy uh what julius Caesar did
[02:48:26.160 --> 02:48:28.560]  there's the problem people say well you know it's only happened to one or two
[02:48:28.560 --> 02:48:32.080]  people but that's the problem is that you don't wait for the full effect you
[02:48:32.080 --> 02:48:35.760]  don't wait for the pretext to happen the next terrorist attack the next 9-11
[02:48:35.760 --> 02:48:39.360]  you stop the you you stand on the principle
[02:48:39.360 --> 02:48:43.200]  you oppose the principle and the principle is he can treat us like occupied
[02:48:43.200 --> 02:48:46.880]  germany or span he can treat us like a foreign enemy and do here at home what
[02:48:46.880 --> 02:48:50.880]  has done abroad to a foreign enemy that's the claim so we must resist that
[02:48:50.880 --> 02:48:54.320]  declare for what it is illegitimate void from inception
[02:48:54.320 --> 02:48:58.560]  has no force in authority and any order given like that should be refused by
[02:48:58.560 --> 02:49:01.440]  the standing arm by the standing military
[02:49:01.440 --> 02:49:05.280]  well that's another issue uh tsa that won't stick their hands on people's
[02:49:05.280 --> 02:49:08.800]  pants who have who worry about the radiation they're being fired so
[02:49:08.800 --> 02:49:11.680]  government is trying to sift through and create the
[02:49:11.680 --> 02:49:15.120]  condrays that will do whatever they're told and you should opt out every time
[02:49:15.120 --> 02:49:18.240]  i always do and unfortunately you shouldn't have to be a
[02:49:18.240 --> 02:49:21.600]  lawyer to get respect but last time i went through a checkpoint i said hey
[02:49:21.600 --> 02:49:24.400]  just don't put your hands on my pants the guy said i can't guarantee that i said
[02:49:24.400 --> 02:49:27.120]  well i'm a lawyer i guess we'll dance afterwards and he was like whoa
[02:49:27.120 --> 02:49:30.240]  and he went and got a supervisor and a supervisor handling with kid gloves
[02:49:30.240 --> 02:49:33.440]  but you shouldn't have to be an attorney to get respect and to have your
[02:49:33.440 --> 02:49:36.800]  privacy and your rights respected it's a travesty
[02:49:36.800 --> 02:49:39.920]  yeah that's what i have the few times i've had the issue come up i go look i'm
[02:49:39.920 --> 02:49:43.120]  a radio talk show host usually know who i am anyways i'm asking for signature
[02:49:43.120 --> 02:49:46.800]  you know uh what do you call it autographs a lot of
[02:49:46.800 --> 02:49:49.680]  marked bad people but they're trying to get rid of those and trying to hire the
[02:49:49.680 --> 02:49:52.880]  bad ones because they can set that precedent to line us up
[02:49:52.880 --> 02:49:56.240]  to searches i mean this is classic what's happening
[02:49:56.240 --> 02:49:59.840]  and then they'll go to buses and this is what we oppose you know categorically
[02:49:59.840 --> 02:50:02.960]  they're already doing it yeah checkpoints are absolutely unconstitutional
[02:50:02.960 --> 02:50:06.640]  that's like right out of nazi germany so i don't think there's any legitimacy at
[02:50:06.640 --> 02:50:10.560]  all and i don't care what the courts say it's not american it's unamerican
[02:50:10.560 --> 02:50:13.920]  plus the plus they're discredited because they just cancel the virtual fence
[02:50:13.920 --> 02:50:16.480]  and they never really built any of the physical fence
[02:50:16.480 --> 02:50:20.240]  i mean the southern border is wide open in a country collapsing into bedlam
[02:50:20.240 --> 02:50:23.040]  and they're not worried about that they're running random checkpoints on
[02:50:23.040 --> 02:50:26.000]  highways around the country 100 miles inland yeah well not even
[02:50:26.000 --> 02:50:29.600]  that they're now all over the country we've got the articles coming in tsa
[02:50:29.600 --> 02:50:32.960]  national guard they have families drive under x-ray machines you know they're
[02:50:32.960 --> 02:50:36.480]  doing it now steward i mean it's i see the reports every week they're just
[02:50:36.480 --> 02:50:40.640]  pouring in yeah they're conditioning conditioning us for more of this stuff
[02:50:40.640 --> 02:50:44.320]  so you know we have to resist and if you can get your sheriff to help you
[02:50:44.320 --> 02:50:48.240]  that's why the sheriff first fill in montana is important um any bills that
[02:50:48.240 --> 02:50:50.800]  that can that's you to back the sheriff up with the
[02:50:50.800 --> 02:50:55.520]  with the authority the law of the state is good absolutely we're on the march the

[02:54:15.760 --> 02:54:19.120]  founder of oath keepers we've also got a fellow in here john surely who's a
[02:54:19.120 --> 02:54:22.640]  sergeant currently uh in the houston pd one of the biggest
[02:54:22.640 --> 02:54:25.680]  in the country he has to give the provides though that he speaks uh you
[02:54:25.680 --> 02:54:29.200]  know privately as a citizen here but uh he's with us uh getting into the
[02:54:29.200 --> 02:54:33.280]  subject of the federalization of police well thanks for having me alex
[02:54:33.280 --> 02:54:36.720]  yeah i unfortunately have to say that i'm speaking for me and for for oath
[02:54:36.720 --> 02:54:38.720]  keepers and state chapter president of oath keepers
[02:54:38.720 --> 02:54:42.240]  but uh i'm concerned the the the federal government has
[02:54:42.240 --> 02:54:45.200]  has turned our police forces into an arm of federal government
[02:54:45.200 --> 02:54:49.760]  just a facto uh by the fact that all are a lot of our training is standardized
[02:54:49.760 --> 02:54:52.480]  already to this day so all police departments are basically
[02:54:52.480 --> 02:54:56.400]  trained the same um there's so many uh we're trying to get rid of your codes
[02:54:56.400 --> 02:54:59.760]  your local codes exactly and not just that but they're also
[02:54:59.760 --> 02:55:03.280]  um trained the training is all standardized
[02:55:03.280 --> 02:55:06.560]  and the money that comes from federal government to run programs for the
[02:55:06.560 --> 02:55:09.520]  for the police departments with all the strings attached to it and the feds are
[02:55:09.520 --> 02:55:13.280]  writing the codes now absolutely and you know a police chief will not cross the
[02:55:13.280 --> 02:55:17.200]  federal government because to do so means the money's yanked away or the money
[02:55:17.200 --> 02:55:19.600]  has to be paid back so they they basically run the police
[02:55:19.600 --> 02:55:24.400]  departments as it is today are the police officers starting to wake up
[02:55:24.400 --> 02:55:29.200]  yes i believe i believe they are you know they're they're quiet about it but
[02:55:29.200 --> 02:55:34.160]  there's no question that when when stuff comes down the officers question
[02:55:34.160 --> 02:55:38.080]  the city or the department initially all the time
[02:55:38.080 --> 02:55:41.280]  they're gonna they're gonna they're gonna ask questions
[02:55:41.280 --> 02:55:44.800]  do you see them trying well instead of me asking questions what do you think is
[02:55:44.800 --> 02:55:47.760]  most important for folks to know about the federalization
[02:55:47.760 --> 02:55:52.480]  um they need to get their local law enforcement off the federal teet
[02:55:52.480 --> 02:55:56.640]  and have them stop taking the federal money and start taking back over their
[02:55:56.640 --> 02:55:59.680]  law enforcement to where they're not seen as as police
[02:55:59.680 --> 02:56:02.640]  officers or law enforcement officers but their officers are seen as peace
[02:56:02.640 --> 02:56:06.080]  officers who actively in the community working for the community and of course
[02:56:06.080 --> 02:56:10.080]  being uh being having fidelity to the constitution
[02:56:10.080 --> 02:56:13.200]  i've also seen a lot of instances where it seems like departments the bad
[02:56:13.200 --> 02:56:16.960]  departments try to protect people that act outrageously and then that
[02:56:16.960 --> 02:56:19.680]  demonizes all the good officers that are out there
[02:56:19.680 --> 02:56:23.440]  that that's definitely a concern i mean we had in houston the the beating video
[02:56:23.440 --> 02:56:26.320]  that just came out in the public several days ago
[02:56:26.320 --> 02:56:31.440]  and uh you know it it pains me to think uh how that taints the whole police
[02:56:31.440 --> 02:56:35.920]  department of over 5 000 people by the by the misactions of eight or nine
[02:56:35.920 --> 02:56:39.440]  but i will say least in houston they are prosecuting them so hopefully the
[02:56:39.440 --> 02:56:43.200]  yeah that's the good news a lot of places they don't right and then that
[02:56:43.200 --> 02:56:49.600]  then that freaks everybody out uh but um why did you get involved in oathkeepers
[02:56:49.600 --> 02:56:52.720]  who you know i stumbled upon the oathkeepers website before they even
[02:56:52.720 --> 02:56:56.880]  rolled out the uh the the the program officially
[02:56:56.880 --> 02:57:00.240]  and i don't remember how i how i got onto it but i read the the 10 orders we
[02:57:00.240 --> 02:57:02.960]  will not do and it was like a light bulb went off on my head
[02:57:02.960 --> 02:57:08.080]  it's like my god this is exactly what we need we need police to understand
[02:57:08.080 --> 02:57:11.840]  the seriousness of the oath they take well look at every other country
[02:57:11.840 --> 02:57:14.800]  it's always the military and police that are used to bring in tyranny
[02:57:14.800 --> 02:57:19.120]  liberty is a very rare thing i mean i mean this is a disease that almost every
[02:57:19.120 --> 02:57:21.520]  country catches that's right we should we should
[02:57:21.520 --> 02:57:25.920]  realize the the rarity of it and that's why people should not try to look for
[02:57:25.920 --> 02:57:29.840]  silver bullets like military coups they should get back to what the founders
[02:57:29.840 --> 02:57:33.440]  gave us the lessons of history are written right in our constitution
[02:57:33.440 --> 02:57:36.480]  and declaration of independence we got to stick to that plan
[02:57:36.480 --> 02:57:39.600]  well i mean if we do go into a full depression and people are running around
[02:57:39.600 --> 02:57:42.640]  starving if 90 percent of people were self-sufficient in the great
[02:57:42.640 --> 02:57:44.480]  depression and they estimate that 10 years
[02:57:44.480 --> 02:57:47.760]  close to seven million starved to death people were very moral back then on
[02:57:47.760 --> 02:57:50.320]  average today can you i mean what we saw on
[02:57:50.320 --> 02:57:54.080]  you know uh black friday with people rioting just for a cheap xbox
[02:57:54.080 --> 02:57:57.280]  it's it's going to be scary and it's designed to make us beg
[02:57:57.280 --> 02:58:02.000]  for the martial law because it'll actually be needed if we don't have local
[02:58:02.000 --> 02:58:05.040]  control that's why we must preempt it by getting all
[02:58:05.040 --> 02:58:08.480]  our veterans including police veterans in fact to get up like i said get off the
[02:58:08.480 --> 02:58:11.200]  couch and go and strengthen their communities and get ready
[02:58:11.200 --> 02:58:14.240]  and we should be starting uh police auxiliaries and reserves
[02:58:14.240 --> 02:58:18.080]  as we have uh state economies collapse and local economies collapse they can
[02:58:18.080 --> 02:58:20.720]  afford officers so they'll be like two or three
[02:58:20.720 --> 02:58:24.240]  john surleys and then they should be backed up by a police auxiliary of
[02:58:24.240 --> 02:58:27.200]  volunteer citizens to be there to help them keep order
[02:58:27.200 --> 02:58:31.200]  when there's rioting that's under local control exactly not the
[02:58:31.200 --> 02:58:33.920]  evil clone of that the feds are trying to build right now
[02:58:33.920 --> 02:58:36.960]  not federalized police officers from someplace else being brought in
[02:58:36.960 --> 02:58:43.840]  as happening katrina yeah stay there back in one minute

[03:00:31.600 --> 03:00:35.120]  they know this vacuum is coming so they're trying to create a federally
[03:00:35.120 --> 03:00:39.440]  locally controlled militia we need the true local i mean
[03:00:39.440 --> 03:00:43.040]  guys talk about that rather than trying to co-opt every infrastructure in the
[03:00:43.040 --> 03:00:46.800]  state and local government the police and we've seen the
[03:00:46.800 --> 03:00:49.600]  working group of for countering violent extremism
[03:00:49.600 --> 03:00:53.600]  that uh some part of loss there is now sitting on a dhs their recommendations
[03:00:53.600 --> 03:00:57.360]  are is to to train and and reach into
[03:00:57.360 --> 03:01:00.720]  um mental health workers family service workers
[03:01:00.720 --> 03:01:04.640]  teachers you know enlisting all of the cable repair guys there yeah everybody
[03:01:04.640 --> 03:01:08.960]  to spy on and to you know to combat violent extremism firemen
[03:01:08.960 --> 03:01:11.680]  yeah absolutely everyone that's why that's why we reach out to all those
[03:01:11.680 --> 03:01:15.680]  institutions as well we reach out to police and fire because we understand
[03:01:15.680 --> 03:01:18.800]  that they are going to be they're being told right now you know if you go into
[03:01:18.800 --> 03:01:21.680]  a home and you see something suspicious you'll let us know about it so taking
[03:01:21.680 --> 03:01:24.240]  fire and they're not even really saying piles of cocaine
[03:01:24.240 --> 03:01:27.760]  it's if you go in there and they got reloading equipment we're seeing realtors
[03:01:27.760 --> 03:01:30.720]  calling police on people and they see reloading or guns
[03:01:30.720 --> 03:01:33.760]  right they're causing hysteria and because of the ignorance of people
[03:01:33.760 --> 03:01:37.280]  about what is legal and not illegal in the united states they're they're
[03:01:37.280 --> 03:01:40.400]  criminalizing things that aren't yet criminal but they're doing it inside the
[03:01:40.400 --> 03:01:43.360]  heads of people and getting them to think that that you're a bad guy if you
[03:01:43.360 --> 03:01:46.400]  have guns and so so like john was saying earlier you know the
[03:01:46.400 --> 03:01:50.000]  nationalization of the police and the federalization of the police is is
[03:01:50.000 --> 03:01:52.560]  really you know very much the same thing that happened in germany
[03:01:52.560 --> 03:01:56.080]  under the nazis they nationalized the police and they co-opted the
[03:01:56.080 --> 03:01:59.120]  independence of the local provinces and we're seeing that
[03:01:59.120 --> 03:02:02.480]  right now you've got sheriffs who who are you know rolling around in these
[03:02:02.480 --> 03:02:06.160]  you know hundred thousand dollar command vehicles that the dhs gives them
[03:02:06.160 --> 03:02:09.680]  your sheriff cannot be independent and be dependent at the same time
[03:02:09.680 --> 03:02:13.200]  and the feds are moving in many states to get rid of sheriffs altogether
[03:02:13.200 --> 03:02:16.400]  right well they want the sheriff to be uh an appointed official yeah yeah and
[03:02:16.400 --> 03:02:18.960]  that's getting rid of them i mean that's yeah yeah it's gutting what the
[03:02:18.960 --> 03:02:21.840]  sheriff does what the sheriff is well that's an attack on the constitution
[03:02:21.840 --> 03:02:24.560]  right there that's in all the state constitutions the sheriff
[03:02:24.560 --> 03:02:27.760]  well so we have to fight back at that let the local level and we're doing it
[03:02:27.760 --> 03:02:31.440]  we're now part of the tenth amendment center nullify now to our going around
[03:02:31.440 --> 03:02:34.800]  the country and talking about state sovereignty and standing up and the
[03:02:34.800 --> 03:02:38.400]  doctrine of interposition of the responsibility and duty of the state
[03:02:38.400 --> 03:02:41.120]  to interpose itself between the federal government
[03:02:41.120 --> 03:02:44.560]  and the citizenry when the state when the feds cross the lines of bounds and
[03:02:44.560 --> 03:02:47.520]  what's great is you're getting not exhausted but running all over the
[03:02:47.520 --> 03:02:50.640]  country yourself you're finding other great leaders like John Shirley and
[03:02:50.640 --> 03:02:54.080]  others who can be force multipliers to speak to even more groups and folks
[03:02:54.080 --> 03:02:56.560]  can find out how to get you guys or other great state
[03:02:56.560 --> 03:02:59.920]  chapter leaders to come speak on the oath keepers website
[03:02:59.920 --> 03:03:02.800]  that's right oath keepers dot org they can go there and we have a free forum
[03:03:02.800 --> 03:03:05.680]  here for texas here as well and all the other states
[03:03:05.680 --> 03:03:09.200]  so they can go there and find all the local chapters absolutely and people
[03:03:09.200 --> 03:03:12.560]  can just get information from the site or they can become full-fledged members
[03:03:12.560 --> 03:03:16.000]  if they're in the military or police and they can be they can be also
[03:03:16.000 --> 03:03:19.200]  associate members if there's an average citizen who wants to support our mission
[03:03:19.200 --> 03:03:22.640]  but you don't have to join if you don't want to and i understand fully
[03:03:22.640 --> 03:03:26.800]  what's why some police officers and active in military would not want to
[03:03:26.800 --> 03:03:29.600]  i understand that we're concerned about being purged out of their job
[03:03:29.600 --> 03:03:32.880]  so we don't ever pressure them but you come to a point where that's why i
[03:03:32.880 --> 03:03:37.200]  admire uh john Shirley here you know active sergeant in houston
[03:03:37.200 --> 03:03:40.880]  there comes a point where uh silences and golden it's yellow and i understand
[03:03:40.880 --> 03:03:43.440]  some folks are really highly classified things other things can't
[03:03:43.440 --> 03:03:46.640]  but it's time to just be counted stand up and say i'm not afraid anymore
[03:03:46.640 --> 03:03:49.520]  you know some people like oh alex you better watch it they'll get you yeah i

[03:04:10.400 --> 03:04:13.600]  are there and that makes the the you know the elites worry
[03:04:13.600 --> 03:04:17.840]  and say we goodnight and they know we've got truth and justice on our side
[03:04:17.840 --> 03:04:22.400]  and people hunger for that i mean we're good people can sense it they know it

[03:08:06.880 --> 03:08:12.800]  the information war continues it's alex jones and the gcn radio network
[03:08:12.800 --> 03:08:16.720]  that's right the globalists have basically occupied this country and many others we're trying to get
[03:08:16.720 --> 03:08:21.840]  our republic back and we had webster pop in earlier for five minutes but i wanted to have him come back
[03:08:21.840 --> 03:08:25.920]  live here to recap and get into the latest developments they are announcing
[03:08:25.920 --> 03:08:29.360]  that hosemubaric in the last few hours is going to step down now they've been saying this for three
[03:08:29.360 --> 03:08:33.920]  weeks to create a self-fulfilling prophecy we're not fans of the dictator hosemubaric
[03:08:33.920 --> 03:08:38.320]  the issue here is it's admitted that our government israel and others even though they
[03:08:38.320 --> 03:08:43.680]  claim they like mubarak have been telling him to step down it is admitted in leon panetta before
[03:08:43.680 --> 03:08:49.840]  this announcement earlier today gave testimony in congress that they were telling him to step down
[03:08:49.840 --> 03:08:55.360]  even step down or make the announcement of stepping down today what is the overall strategy
[03:08:55.360 --> 03:09:01.200]  what's happening here glenn beck is saying it's the muslim ottoman empire the caliphate coming back
[03:09:01.200 --> 03:09:06.160]  well in a way that's true they're trying to destabilize the middle east what's the larger
[03:09:06.160 --> 03:09:12.080]  geopolitical aims uh historian doctor of history also in economics uh he has a doctorate in uh
[03:09:12.080 --> 03:09:17.360]  history but he's also a economist his webster griffin tarpley is also an author wrote the
[03:09:17.360 --> 03:09:22.160]  unauthorized biography of george herbert walker bush and the unauthorized biography of uh baracus
[03:09:22.160 --> 03:09:28.240]  san obama you've got the floor for the next 12 minutes sir break down exactly what's happening
[03:09:28.240 --> 03:09:33.520]  here well the first thing i would say is there may be now a counter-couin process it's it's been
[03:09:33.520 --> 03:09:40.240]  four or five hours since leon panetta opened his big yap at the house uh intelligence committee
[03:09:40.240 --> 03:09:45.600]  hearing in the in the capital here in washington this morning saying oh it is a very strong likelihood
[03:09:45.600 --> 03:09:50.880]  that mubarak will be out by the end of the day and i think he realized that this was a very stupid
[03:09:50.880 --> 03:09:57.120]  thing to do a new low of stupidity even for the cia because imagine you're a nationalist
[03:09:57.120 --> 03:10:02.720]  egyptian officer or even you know in normal egyptian your country's future is being announced in
[03:10:02.720 --> 03:10:08.400]  washington dc by the head of this cia you might in some of these people should they might die of
[03:10:08.400 --> 03:10:15.520]  shame as a result of this so there could be a nationalist backlash of nationalist officers
[03:10:15.520 --> 03:10:20.320]  in the egyptian military and elsewhere that don't want to go along with this right if the
[03:10:20.960 --> 03:10:26.000]  typically if the generals want to go one way the kernels might want to go another way that's
[03:10:26.000 --> 03:10:31.840]  what happened in egypt in 1952 when masser came in as the as the revolt of the kernels they might
[03:10:31.840 --> 03:10:37.360]  also be an interservice rivalry if we're going to have a military junta they may be fighting over
[03:10:37.360 --> 03:10:44.320]  the seats in that military junta and if the army is getting too many seats remember the air force
[03:10:44.320 --> 03:10:50.160]  is where mubarak came from and the the attitude of the air force has been a kind of a question mark
[03:10:50.160 --> 03:10:56.240]  much of his cabinet is air force right so maybe the air force is fighting the army for four seats
[03:10:56.240 --> 03:11:02.400]  in the junta anyway i don't think it was very smart of panetta to announce this on the other hand
[03:11:02.400 --> 03:11:08.240]  that may be what they had to do in other words the u.s side it seems to me they saw that these
[03:11:08.240 --> 03:11:13.520]  crowds were dwindling there was a big hysteria in the last couple of days that the crowds were
[03:11:13.520 --> 03:11:18.160]  bigger than they ever were but if you look at what they did they filled in most of that square with
[03:11:18.160 --> 03:11:24.640]  a tent city where no people could really go and mill around so they seemed to me they were dealing
[03:11:24.640 --> 03:11:32.240]  with a fairly anemic fairly feeble response to all this demagogy and the golden youth were there
[03:11:32.240 --> 03:11:38.320]  yes the golden youth were there overnight and the muslim brotherhood would come in on on fridays
[03:11:38.320 --> 03:11:44.560]  and other days when they wanted something i don't think they ever got much over 50 000 and i think
[03:11:44.560 --> 03:11:48.960]  if they had they they would have shown it to us right compare what you've seen in that square in
[03:11:48.960 --> 03:11:55.200]  cairo to the obama inauguration the obama inauguration was indeed something in the area three quarters
[03:11:55.200 --> 03:12:01.200]  of a million or something like this nothing like that uh in egypt so yeah this looks more
[03:12:01.200 --> 03:12:06.960]  like a sport stadium of 60 000 people they keep showing tight shots of it on algezera right the
[03:12:06.960 --> 03:12:11.360]  pope gets fat you know two or three times a year some in the summer the pope can get that pretty
[03:12:11.360 --> 03:12:18.160]  much every week uh be it be it uh you know sunday or or wednesday but the the uh what's the reason
[03:12:18.160 --> 03:12:23.280]  for all this why i mean why is the west now admitting that they engineered this against their own
[03:12:23.280 --> 03:12:29.200]  blood thirsty ally well again blood thirsty you know in the sense of war i think not in
[03:12:29.200 --> 03:12:37.200]  other words what's what's the big u.s project it's it's been since 2004 2005 is to assemble
[03:12:37.760 --> 03:12:43.680]  this united front of countries it would be the arabs and above all that means the sunni
[03:12:43.680 --> 03:12:49.680]  arabs and that of course means egypt but but also the the others uh the sunni arab countries
[03:12:49.680 --> 03:12:55.520]  together with the united states however together with israel and the key element of this the creation
[03:12:55.520 --> 03:13:05.120]  of an anti- iranian anti-shiite front depended on having a a nuclear umbrella nuclear protection
[03:13:05.680 --> 03:13:11.200]  extended by the united states to these countries to israel to egypt to to the gulf states the emirates
[03:13:11.200 --> 03:13:17.520]  kuwait oman and so forth and to Saudi Arabia and right in the middle of that in august of 2009
[03:13:17.520 --> 03:13:24.800]  mubarak said no i don't want it he said this is a bribe to the israelis i don't want to normalize
[03:13:24.800 --> 03:13:30.480]  with the israelis uh without you know negotiating you know a series of issues that are that are my
[03:13:30.480 --> 03:13:37.280]  issues egyptian uh issues and after mubarak had opposed this u.s nuclear umbrella because this is
[03:13:37.280 --> 03:13:41.520]  not a good thing right that means the u.s gets involved immediately in any war in the middle
[03:13:41.520 --> 03:13:47.360]  east i don't think we want this mubarak took to stand and then the Saudis were then also able
[03:13:47.360 --> 03:13:54.000]  to say we also don't want this we don't want this uh the normalization with israel in other words
[03:13:54.000 --> 03:13:59.520]  what the u.s was trying to do is to create a military alliance that would lock in egypt and the
[03:13:59.520 --> 03:14:06.320]  Saudis and the israelis all in one united front this is a this is a very uncomfortable position
[03:14:06.320 --> 03:14:14.640]  for arab leaders to be in so he said no uh he also said hey us in 2006 2007 you're trying to get out
[03:14:14.640 --> 03:14:21.760]  of iraq too fast uh that may turn out to be prophetic the other thing was during that that israeli
[03:14:21.760 --> 03:14:28.400]  lebanon war the attack on lebanon by the israelis in the summer of 2006 mubarak was trying to
[03:14:29.040 --> 03:14:36.240]  promote trying to mediate a contact between the israelis and the syrians to try to end it
[03:14:36.240 --> 03:14:41.600]  and he said the u.s that that time the bush administration the u.s was sabotaging the effort
[03:14:41.600 --> 03:14:48.080]  to have a direct channel between israel and syria to put uh to put an end to it so there's lots
[03:14:48.080 --> 03:14:53.200]  and lots of friction mubarak is well entrenched or was well entrenched he was somebody with the
[03:14:53.200 --> 03:14:58.640]  mind of his own he wasn't nationalist he was rough he was old he was stubborn he was prickly
[03:14:58.640 --> 03:15:04.080]  the u.s was not getting what they wanted and again the last contact i know of is a telephone
[03:15:04.080 --> 03:15:10.880]  call from obama to mubarak on january 19th in which obama says thank you for supporting what
[03:15:10.880 --> 03:15:18.400]  we're doing in lebanon with this commission which is this um fake kangaroo court where they're
[03:15:18.400 --> 03:15:23.920]  going to indict hezbollah and blame them for the death of hariri when there really is no proof and
[03:15:23.920 --> 03:15:30.080]  there are you know half a dozen candidates as many countries as have secret intelligence in the
[03:15:30.080 --> 03:15:35.120]  middle east right you can go through the list but they're going to pin it all on hezbollah
[03:15:35.120 --> 03:15:41.280]  and mubarak could see that simply a recipe for destabilization and and possible war so he has
[03:15:41.280 --> 03:15:45.760]  opposed it but but obama then calls him up and says thank you for supporting what i'm doing i'm
[03:15:45.760 --> 03:15:51.680]  sure mubarak said look i don't support what you're doing so that was the 19th of january and that's
[03:15:51.680 --> 03:15:58.720]  about a week before the uh the national endowment for democracy and the uh international republican
[03:15:58.720 --> 03:16:05.200]  institute and these other groups essentially gave the signal to mobilize right by twitter and facebook
[03:16:05.200 --> 03:16:12.400]  led by this guy gonym the the lemon the robust pair of the revolution is a google executive his
[03:16:12.400 --> 03:16:18.160]  name is gonym he's this sort of squirrely guy you saw on television yesterday and that's that's
[03:16:18.160 --> 03:16:26.240]  supposedly the uh the charismatic leader of the revolution now who could take over um some people
[03:16:26.240 --> 03:16:31.840]  say general suliman because general suliman is the head of the uh he's the vice president now
[03:16:31.840 --> 03:16:37.200]  he would be in theory the the successor i guess uh from some points of view although not from the
[03:16:37.200 --> 03:16:43.680]  egyptian constitution suliman uh is the contact with the israelis with the cia and all the rest of it
[03:16:43.680 --> 03:16:49.920]  will it be suliman as essentially a military dictator or at least a first among the equals
[03:16:49.920 --> 03:16:55.600]  or will it be a military junta and they say that the military junta would likely include
[03:16:55.600 --> 03:17:02.880]  tantawi the defense minister and general sami anon or anon the the head of the general
[03:17:02.880 --> 03:17:10.880]  staff now these were the two who were in washington on the 25th 26 27 28th of january when it all
[03:17:10.880 --> 03:17:18.480]  got started and some people thought well uh maybe the us time the revolt to to have the the two top
[03:17:18.480 --> 03:17:22.960]  officers the people who would direct the military response out of the country but i think it's
[03:17:22.960 --> 03:17:29.440]  probably more likely now that tantawi and anon were in washington to prepare the overthrow of
[03:17:29.440 --> 03:17:35.200]  mubarak and they were simply overtaken by these street demonstrations going faster than they thought
[03:17:35.200 --> 03:17:41.840]  remember in these cases when you have a color revolution the coup d'etat is always something
[03:17:41.840 --> 03:17:47.840]  behind the scenes in many cases the the the color revolution occurs when the coup d'etat has already
[03:17:47.840 --> 03:17:52.960]  happened when that when the changes have been made behind the scenes when the u.s has bought and
[03:17:52.960 --> 03:17:58.400]  corrupted or blackmailed or whatever various players in the military and the bureaucracy
[03:17:58.400 --> 03:18:04.720]  to get this the solution that they want next and they want somebody much weaker than mubarak much
[03:18:04.720 --> 03:18:12.240]  more pliable much more of a u.s puppet than than mubarak had become so it seems to me that that
[03:18:12.240 --> 03:18:19.520]  there's a good case that that the u.s plan was to have these two generals tantawi and anon kick out
[03:18:19.520 --> 03:18:26.720]  mubarak and take over you know almost well two weeks ago whatever it was the 27th 28th 29th of
[03:18:26.720 --> 03:18:32.000]  january but it didn't work because mubarak is stubborn mubarak fought back mubarak has a
[03:18:32.000 --> 03:18:36.560]  presidential but we've only got one minute left you're saying this this there may be a counter
[03:18:36.560 --> 03:18:40.880]  coup in closing what do you see happening well there could be a counter coup i don't know that
[03:18:40.880 --> 03:18:44.400]  if mubarak doesn't come out and speak tonight then it's a counter coup but the thing that we know
[03:18:44.400 --> 03:18:51.280]  if this if this winter comes in or if suliman takes over into these conditions under cia sponsorship
[03:18:51.280 --> 03:18:56.480]  the attack on iran comes closer this is what people have to see that all this nice rhetoric
[03:18:56.480 --> 03:19:02.000]  about democracy and the golden youth is all baloney it means that the attack on iran becomes more
[03:19:02.000 --> 03:19:06.800]  likely because mubarak was somebody who said no i don't want that and the Saudis were strengthened
[03:19:06.800 --> 03:19:11.920]  by him to say no we probably want to you know cool that you know somehow we don't want to be
[03:19:11.920 --> 03:19:16.880]  involved you do it we're gonna we're gonna set this one out so the the thing makes the general
[03:19:16.880 --> 03:19:23.040]  war in the middle east more likely so for all of israel's talk about liking uh mubarak they've
[03:19:23.040 --> 03:19:28.240]  really been the ones pushing for the attack on iran are they involved in this who the israelis
[03:19:29.360 --> 03:19:33.360]  i think the israelis probably have a dual uh posture just like the united states in other
[03:19:33.360 --> 03:19:39.040]  words it with with the but in their heart of hearts do they want it i think netanyahu would
[03:19:39.040 --> 03:19:44.640]  probably say that his life is easier if if mubarak stays but the mosad may say no we have our own
[03:19:44.640 --> 03:19:48.560]  approach to this we're going with the u.s or whatever it is all right webster thank you so
