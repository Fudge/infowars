[00:00.000 --> 00:12.400]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.400 --> 00:21.160]  he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from austin texas alex jones
[00:21.160 --> 00:32.000]  pandemic or nothing worse than a mild case of the flu here in thailand the
[00:32.000 --> 00:36.240]  swine flu vaccination program has just begun but in other parts of the world
[00:36.240 --> 00:41.320]  serious questions are being raised about the handling of the pandemic health
[00:41.320 --> 00:44.920]  officials around the world had believed swine flu could kill hundreds of
[00:44.920 --> 00:49.720]  thousands if not millions they introduced emergency measures and spent in
[00:49.720 --> 00:54.840]  excess of 20 billion dollars on vaccines but now wolfgang bodard head of
[00:54.840 --> 00:59.400]  health at the council of europe says they got it wrong not only that they were
[00:59.400 --> 01:03.840]  misled by the world health organization and unduly influenced by drug
[01:03.840 --> 01:08.920]  companies the WHO in cooperation with some big pharmaceutical companies and
[01:08.920 --> 01:14.400]  their scientists redefined pandemics and lowered the alarm threshold those new
[01:14.400 --> 01:19.000]  standards forced politicians in most states to react immediately and sign
[01:19.000 --> 01:22.960]  marketing commitments for additional and new vaccines against swine flu and
[01:22.960 --> 01:28.360]  spend billions of dollars to catch up france is one country feeling the
[01:28.360 --> 01:34.540]  prick of embarrassment officials spent a staggering 1.25 billion dollars by 94
[01:34.540 --> 01:41.040]  million doses of h1n1 vaccine so far only 5 million have been used now the
[01:41.040 --> 01:47.040]  country like many others that bought big is trying to sell off surplus stock
[01:47.040 --> 01:52.160]  having committed to buy the vaccines dr. Vodak says health officials then
[01:52.160 --> 01:56.520]  sought to justify their decision never before the search for traces of a
[01:56.520 --> 02:01.200]  virus was carried out so broadly and intensively besides many cases of death
[02:01.200 --> 02:05.320]  that happened to coincide with seropositive h1n1 lab findings were
[02:05.320 --> 02:11.440]  simply attributed to swine flu and used to foster fear nearly 13,000 people
[02:11.440 --> 02:15.480]  worldwide have died of the virus the largest share in the United States and
[02:15.480 --> 02:20.200]  Canada officials say it's now peaking in Central Europe parts of Asia and the
[02:20.200 --> 02:25.200]  Middle East but it hasn't been the killer some predicted in the figure of
[02:25.200 --> 02:30.960]  12,000 is compared to more than 250,000 people who die of seasonal flu each
[02:30.960 --> 02:36.920]  year dr. Vodak says the h1n1 vaccine was not sufficiently tested and was
[02:36.920 --> 02:42.120]  needlessly exposed to millions of healthy people drugmaker GlaxoSmithKline
[02:42.120 --> 02:47.040]  have responded by saying allegations of undue influence are misguided and
[02:47.040 --> 02:52.200]  unfounded the WHO declared that h1n1 swine flu met the criteria for a
[02:52.200 --> 02:57.840]  pandemic responding to it has required unprecedented collaboration as WHO has
[02:57.840 --> 03:01.920]  stated legal regulations and numerous safeguards are in place to manage
[03:01.920 --> 03:05.880]  possible conflicts of interest the Council of Europe has decided to
[03:05.880 --> 03:10.560]  investigate his claims it proven the industry that profited most from the
[03:10.560 --> 03:14.720]  pandemic the drug companies may now have the most to fear
[03:14.720 --> 03:21.280]  Tariq Vasily Al Jazeera and that's also being reported on BBC all over
[03:21.280 --> 03:25.800]  European TV and print not much of that is making it into the United States where
[03:25.800 --> 03:30.640]  we have one of the most controlled mainstream medias so go back to
[03:30.640 --> 03:36.760]  January of last year several months before the flu hype even began I said
[03:36.760 --> 03:43.000]  you're gonna see massive flu hi I don't know if it's gonna be real or not but
[03:43.000 --> 03:49.800]  the government is quietly preparing for a freak out then they ran around to all
[03:49.800 --> 03:54.040]  the states in the United States and in Europe but the sub districts and said
[03:54.040 --> 03:59.520]  this is real don't tell the public it's the end of the world we got those
[03:59.520 --> 04:06.200]  documents and we said is it staged is it just a moneymaker or is it really a
[04:06.200 --> 04:13.880]  pandemic and then we separately exposed from day one what was in the nasal and
[04:13.880 --> 04:26.280]  injectable flu shot cancer viruses mercury RNA other chemicals the list went
[04:26.280 --> 04:29.840]  on and on the insert admitted it can cause Guillain-Barre other neurological
[04:29.840 --> 04:36.160]  disorders cancer sterility reduced fertility now the vaccine system is
[04:36.160 --> 04:40.000]  always been a scam but this is one of the first cases when they stage this hype
[04:40.000 --> 04:44.400]  that we the people of the planet the alternative media have exposed them and
[04:44.400 --> 04:49.640]  force this out into the open so yet again we are proven correct and we're
[04:49.640 --> 04:53.920]  making headway against the globalist as the majority of the population refused
[04:53.920 --> 04:57.760]  to take the shots were in the past the majority would take it a bunch of other
[04:57.760 --> 05:02.720]  key news straight ahead this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should
[05:02.720 --> 05:07.120]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[05:07.120 --> 05:11.120]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[05:11.120 --> 05:15.040]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[05:15.040 --> 05:19.080]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[05:19.080 --> 05:23.640]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[05:23.640 --> 05:27.640]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[05:27.640 --> 05:31.440]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[05:31.440 --> 05:35.080]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[05:35.080 --> 05:39.440]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[05:39.440 --> 05:42.560]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[05:42.560 --> 05:46.280]  generators offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you
[05:46.280 --> 05:51.840]  can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com

[06:10.240 --> 06:14.320]  this agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home
[06:14.320 --> 06:19.440]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really
[06:19.440 --> 06:24.240]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American
[06:24.240 --> 06:28.560]  citizens to pay attention fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[06:28.560 --> 06:33.840]  nation the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on
[06:33.840 --> 06:38.160]  its ashes constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke the arsonists
[06:38.160 --> 06:41.640]  they're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who do we make the
[06:41.640 --> 06:46.880]  checkout to today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we
[06:46.880 --> 06:52.560]  have seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD

[08:06.680 --> 08:20.560]  there's a war on for your mind
[08:20.560 --> 08:30.560]  in my vital stacks before me we have the latest Bankster or banker gate
[08:30.560 --> 08:37.120]  information that could prove to be a mortal wound against the New World Order
[08:37.120 --> 08:48.120]  if we press the issue in this battle for truth and justice also senator Dodd is
[08:48.120 --> 08:54.360]  saying that the government takeover of healthcare is hanging by a thread that's
[08:54.360 --> 08:58.200]  why they've been putting out the last month the propaganda line that it's a
[08:58.200 --> 09:06.000]  foregone conclusion that the bill will pass it's 60 40 right now in my
[09:06.000 --> 09:10.640]  estimation in my dead reckoning that it is going to pass out of conference but
[09:10.640 --> 09:17.400]  Democrats are exiting fast because they realize it is political suicide because
[09:17.400 --> 09:20.840]  it's not only Republicans libertarians and conservatives that have looked at
[09:20.840 --> 09:28.120]  the different versions of the bill now secretly being integrated or spliced to
[09:28.120 --> 09:32.120]  gather in conference committee between the House and Senate but liberals
[09:32.120 --> 09:38.320]  labor unions socialist big government collectivist have read it and are now
[09:38.320 --> 09:42.080]  come to the conclusion that we told you four months ago as we saw the earlier
[09:42.080 --> 09:47.920]  versions it is a giant robbery if you have a banker bailout it's a scam if you
[09:47.920 --> 09:52.000]  have a new war it's a scam if you have a big terror attack it's a scam if you
[09:52.000 --> 09:56.280]  have a new healthcare bill it's a scam that's all you're going to get out of
[09:56.280 --> 09:59.640]  this criminal government they've already committed so many crimes violated the
[09:59.640 --> 10:04.680]  Constitution the banks have already committed so many crimes why not I
[10:04.680 --> 10:09.240]  mean it's like if you've committed 10 murders why not commit 100 more one of
[10:09.240 --> 10:13.280]  the most dangerous type of criminals if you study criminology is a criminal that's
[10:13.280 --> 10:17.040]  already robbed a bank already shot and killed a couple people including a
[10:17.040 --> 10:22.040]  police officer video of them is on the news they're identified the person knows
[10:22.040 --> 10:27.480]  they're going to the lethal injection chair or gurney and they have nothing to
[10:27.480 --> 10:34.160]  lose they're deadly dangerous and that's exactly the mentality the psychology
[10:34.160 --> 10:37.920]  we're dealing with with government worldwide controlled by these private
[10:37.920 --> 10:46.360]  offshore banking interest they have nothing to lose nothing to lose they are
[10:46.360 --> 10:53.200]  violating the entire Constitution the entire bill of rights in ways that are
[10:53.200 --> 10:59.800]  satirical and cartoonish if it wasn't so real and dangerous it's ridiculous the
[10:59.800 --> 11:06.560]  things they do openly in your face and so the sky is the limit giant terror
[11:06.560 --> 11:14.480]  attacks new wars world war three with Iran police state events plunging the
[11:14.480 --> 11:20.840]  economy by design releasing bio weapons Obama says get ready for bio weapon
[11:20.840 --> 11:26.120]  attacks in a new executive order one of the things I believe since last January
[11:26.120 --> 11:30.960]  before the flu hype even began we got intel from multiple sources at the state
[11:30.960 --> 11:37.520]  and federal level but they were getting ready for a big flu hysteria was that I
[11:37.520 --> 11:43.320]  believed it would probably be a preparatory phase to test federalization
[11:43.320 --> 11:47.120]  and globalization under the World Health Organization to test international
[11:47.120 --> 11:54.680]  control over the regional bureaucracies and to see if the public would buy into
[11:54.680 --> 12:00.880]  it the public did not buy into it and analyzing enemy operations and enemy
[12:00.880 --> 12:06.880]  psychology that tends towards them not launching a real bio attack now they
[12:06.880 --> 12:10.920]  still may do it but if we would have bought into this bought into this drill
[12:10.920 --> 12:15.880]  bought into this psychological operation and we analyzed all the different
[12:15.880 --> 12:20.760]  variants and possibilities if we would have bought into this and if we wouldn't
[12:20.760 --> 12:24.960]  have stood up to it and if millions of people worldwide predominantly our
[12:24.960 --> 12:29.240]  listeners wouldn't have printed out the actual vaccine drug inserts of how
[12:29.240 --> 12:34.760]  deadly the vaccine is and if you hadn't gotten the word out and gone through the
[12:34.760 --> 12:39.760]  hell many of you did and if nurses and doctors and police in New York state and
[12:39.760 --> 12:44.160]  Massachusetts and other states that tried to make it mandatory if you wouldn't
[12:44.160 --> 12:50.000]  have said no and they use all their psychological techniques of isolating you
[12:50.000 --> 12:54.360]  making you feel like you were alone if you would have failed that test if we
[12:54.360 --> 12:57.880]  would have failed that test they would have probably already released a bio
[12:57.880 --> 13:04.360]  weapon again is the perfect smoke screen to take over society and further loot
[13:04.360 --> 13:09.800]  and to distract from all their other crimes more and more they're moving
[13:09.800 --> 13:17.280]  towards the war crisis the war false flag so in my stacks we have the latest
[13:17.280 --> 13:20.960]  on Bankster gate the latest on government health care in deep trouble as
[13:20.960 --> 13:27.560]  people actually find out what's in it we have the latest on the economy the
[13:27.560 --> 13:33.920]  latest on the flu and mainstream news openly saying it was a staged fraud by
[13:33.920 --> 13:38.880]  governments to grab power and by big pharma to make a bunch of money that's
[13:38.880 --> 13:45.040]  BBC that's Al Zazira that's mainstream newspapers all over the world that is
[13:45.040 --> 13:50.960]  the European Union's head doctor the who themselves the World Health
[13:50.960 --> 13:54.920]  Organization the World Genocide Association are saying they're now
[13:54.920 --> 13:59.960]  going to investigate themselves look at this ridiculous Reuters headline who to
[13:59.960 --> 14:04.600]  review it's handling overview themselves like Janet Reno investigating
[14:04.600 --> 14:10.400]  herself for wake up or Bush appointing the 9-11 Commission and then calling an
[14:10.400 --> 14:14.080]  independent that'd be like Hitler appointing Herman Guring at Nuremberg
[14:14.080 --> 14:22.160]  to be the head judge or Heinrich Himmler who to review is handling of H1 in one
[14:22.160 --> 14:27.480]  flu pandemic the male online headline and literally hundreds of others the
[14:27.480 --> 14:31.880]  false pandemic drug firms cashed in on scare over swine flu claims Euro
[14:31.880 --> 14:37.880]  health chief at the start of the show we played that short Al Zazira piece you
[14:37.880 --> 14:42.520]  can listen to Sky TV BBC German English channels they're all saying the same
[14:42.520 --> 14:47.680]  thing total premeditated fraud indictments in the wings of who
[14:47.680 --> 14:54.960]  officials colluding they talk about how it was a unified hype a unified fraud
[14:54.960 --> 14:58.640]  imagine how they tried to scare the states in January before there was any
[14:58.640 --> 15:06.920]  talk of flu in Indiana and New York and Texas and California and Florida just
[15:06.920 --> 15:12.360]  some of the states that we got government documents from Bureau of
[15:12.360 --> 15:20.760]  Presence New York State emergency managers Illinois Indiana Department of
[15:20.760 --> 15:29.240]  Education Health Department consultations in Texas Department of
[15:29.240 --> 15:34.680]  Emergency Management California we got these documents in January and February
[15:34.680 --> 15:39.360]  and in March and in April before they launched it in late April where they
[15:39.360 --> 15:43.480]  were going into police departments and telling them get ready for martial law
[15:43.480 --> 15:48.560]  there will be tens of billions dead from the flu there will be a collapse of
[15:48.560 --> 15:55.160]  society there will be hundreds of thousands buried per cemetery guaranteed
[15:55.160 --> 15:59.720]  nationwide and I went on air and I said I don't believe they're really gonna do
[15:59.720 --> 16:05.520]  this but we have to take these murderers seriously look for flu hype in the fall
[16:05.520 --> 16:10.800]  of 2009 and right on time the staged event arrived I mean we have these
[16:10.800 --> 16:20.720]  people caught red-handed hand in the false flag terror jar in the cookie jar
[16:20.720 --> 16:25.480]  and we got hacked in April when we put out exactly what they were doing in
[16:25.480 --> 16:29.480]  articles they shut down info wars in prison planet for four days very
[16:29.480 --> 16:36.320]  sophisticated hacker attacks my IT guys were battling them in real time in the
[16:36.320 --> 16:42.160]  servers as it was going on I mean clear 100 percent hacking from a government
[16:42.160 --> 16:52.040]  slash corporate system multifaceted multi-layered attacks they did not want
[16:52.040 --> 16:57.360]  us exposing it this is a very valuable radio show ladies and gentlemen and I'm
[16:57.360 --> 17:00.720]  really beginning to sense and realize and become more confident in just how
[17:00.720 --> 17:04.800]  accurate we are in laying out the spectrum analysis of their attack
[17:04.800 --> 17:15.840]  patterns and just how wonderful you are as an audience exposing these people how
[17:15.840 --> 17:19.920]  precious you are that you're educated and informed I've been studying this for
[17:19.920 --> 17:24.360]  16 17 years I've been on air for now more than 14 I've been on the air since
[17:24.360 --> 17:41.480]  1995 it'll be 15 years and three months right at 15 years on air and I have
[17:41.480 --> 17:47.640]  learned so much and I learned so much more exponentially every day not just
[17:47.640 --> 17:52.000]  about government and corporations and elites and how they operate but about
[17:52.000 --> 18:00.000]  everything relationships business management and that's why the government
[18:00.000 --> 18:03.880]  wants 18 to 25 year olds in the military that's why they want police
[18:03.880 --> 18:07.360]  officers who are young with low IQs that's come out mainstream news Newsweek
[18:07.360 --> 18:11.640]  magazine all over the country they won't hire cops the last decade above 100 IQ
[18:11.640 --> 18:16.240]  in the past they wanted people who were smart to be cops because they want you
[18:16.240 --> 18:26.880]  to be young dumb and arrogantly full of your own bravada macho
[18:26.880 --> 18:32.120]  hootspo whatever you want to call it they don't want you to have true wisdom I

[24:11.320 --> 24:19.360]  245 kind of rod at his shoulder and there at the hip and everybody knew you didn't give no lip to Big John
[24:19.360 --> 24:22.320]  Big John
[24:22.320 --> 24:31.000]  guess who's joining us in the next hour his maiden voyage with us George Hunt he
[24:31.000 --> 24:36.920]  worked for years with Maury Strong the Rothschilds the Rockefellers he was an
[24:36.920 --> 24:41.240]  environmentalist found out it was all a big land grab I recommended him he
[24:41.240 --> 24:44.060]  though he's never been with us I've talked to him on the phone and played
[24:44.060 --> 24:53.040]  clips of some of his speeches and he hasn't done interviews in a while he is
[24:53.040 --> 24:58.680]  going to be joining us I recommended him for the secret society global death
[24:58.680 --> 25:04.800]  plot episode one of their highest rated for Jesse Ventura's conspiracy theory
[25:04.800 --> 25:08.720]  TV show the last episode is probably gonna get picked up next year it got
[25:08.720 --> 25:15.160]  record ratings if it doesn't something's going on we are into next year in 2010
[25:15.160 --> 25:19.800]  should get picked up in the next season but that's in negotiations right now the
[25:19.800 --> 25:24.440]  point is he was a key part of that episode I didn't want to have him on
[25:24.440 --> 25:30.880]  here until after he'd been on conspiracy theory Jesse Ventura is in Mexico
[25:30.880 --> 25:35.960]  taking a few months off surfing but his son Tyrell Ventura great guy
[25:35.960 --> 25:41.560]  cameraman one of the producers on the show did so much work and research he's
[25:41.560 --> 25:49.680]  the guy along with myself that woke up governor Ventura four years ago he had
[25:49.680 --> 25:53.240]  already talked to his father about 911 being an inside job and when I met with
[25:53.240 --> 25:57.000]  Jesse in Texas four years ago and gave him the material well that was the chain
[25:57.000 --> 26:06.400]  reaction so Tyrell Ventura will be joining us tomorrow one of the first
[26:06.400 --> 26:11.600]  radio interviews he's done his father's very private person and he had to get
[26:11.600 --> 26:15.480]  authorization from him as he likes to keep his family private because of some
[26:15.480 --> 26:19.200]  of the persecution they went through when he was governor but Tyrell is joining
[26:19.200 --> 26:26.120]  us very interesting very informed person and so we look forward to Tyrell
[26:26.120 --> 26:32.040]  Ventura tomorrow but George Hunt served as a naval officer on cruiser destroyers
[26:32.040 --> 26:34.720]  held corporate positions for eight years and worked as an entrepreneur in the
[26:34.720 --> 26:41.240]  health industry and in 91 he became very profitable and then it goes into how he
[26:41.240 --> 26:47.080]  got into work with the United Nations World Conservation Bank that is all
[26:47.080 --> 26:53.280]  coming up in the next hour and I witness to the Rockefellers the Roth
[26:53.280 --> 26:57.080]  Childs Maury strong this is going to be extremely informative we're going to
[26:57.080 --> 27:02.480]  play some clips here on air some of which have never before been heard today I
[27:02.480 --> 27:11.280]  want to play one now of Maury strong talking about Roth Child at one of
[27:11.280 --> 27:18.680]  these closed-door meetings where they were decades ago we've got Hunt coming
[27:18.680 --> 27:23.080]  up the next hour to give you the dates and times and places talking to the
[27:23.080 --> 27:26.760]  power elite about how they were going to set up a one-world government but more
[27:26.760 --> 27:34.280]  that's coming in the next hour here's that first clip he he was is one of the
[27:34.280 --> 27:39.720]  trustees of the International Wilderness Foundation which sponsored this meeting
[27:39.720 --> 27:47.000]  he has he was at the first of these Congresses so his conversion to the
[27:47.000 --> 27:53.320]  relationship between conservation and economic development has been a
[27:53.320 --> 27:59.480]  pioneering one his work on many downs he's you know I used to be in the
[27:59.480 --> 28:06.040]  hydroelectric power part of the energy business myself and the many of the
[28:06.040 --> 28:11.480]  energy developments we've seen have come from his early anticipation of our
[28:11.480 --> 28:15.920]  energy needs and his early work in supporting pioneering initiatives to
[28:15.920 --> 28:23.200]  deal with these needs there he is introducing Roth Child there are so
[28:23.200 --> 28:29.560]  many of these clips we're gonna try to play most of them today and get George
[28:29.560 --> 28:34.520]  Hunt to comment on them he was kind enough to put them to mp3 and send them
[28:34.520 --> 28:39.440]  to us but we're gonna give a general overview of how this plan works how this
[28:39.440 --> 28:49.040]  program works coming up in the next hour with George Washington Hunt gotta love
[28:49.040 --> 28:58.400]  that middle name George Washington Hunt joining us coming up in the next hour

[29:08.720 --> 29:12.640]  into the latest on Bankster gate and then after Hunt leaves us in the third
[29:12.640 --> 29:16.520]  hour I'm gonna detail what really happened with flu gate and that's now
[29:16.520 --> 29:21.360]  what it's being called people say why do we put gate on the end of all these
[29:21.360 --> 29:26.880]  because the public associates that with Watergate and it it means government
[29:26.880 --> 29:31.040]  scandal that could bring down the whole system so that is coming up we have some
[29:31.040 --> 29:39.080]  other special announcements as well today and we're going to have open phones

[36:16.600 --> 36:21.080]  con the public lied so many times that the population not just in North
[36:21.080 --> 36:26.320]  America the United States and Canada but the population of the world is waking
[36:26.320 --> 36:31.720]  up to the true power structure that a private offshore banking cartel is
[36:31.720 --> 36:36.720]  openly establishing a global corporate dictatorship a governmental system of
[36:36.720 --> 36:41.440]  tyranny known as global governance or the New World Order that's what the
[36:41.440 --> 36:46.680]  elites call it global governance or New World Order or international collective
[36:46.680 --> 36:50.440]  those are some of the words and we've got clips of Maury Strong coming up where
[36:50.440 --> 36:54.000]  he says we're gonna collectivize all the money of the corporations and pay it
[36:54.000 --> 36:58.840]  into the UN i.e. the Rothschilds and Rockefellers who were at attendance and
[36:58.840 --> 37:07.080]  spoke at these events we've got clips of them coming up and so now the people
[37:07.080 --> 37:09.920]  aren't looking at the Tories or labor in England they're not looking at the
[37:09.920 --> 37:13.360]  Republicans or Democrats oh they're looking at them but they're following the
[37:13.360 --> 37:19.240]  strings attached to their arms and legs and heads and their mouths up to the
[37:19.240 --> 37:27.400]  actual puppeteers the people controlling the marionettes the political
[37:27.400 --> 37:36.320]  androids the political meat puppet political whores and prostitutes and
[37:36.320 --> 37:43.680]  pimps that are looting and robbing our society and sure they bait and switch
[37:43.680 --> 37:47.320]  Republicans get into power push the establishment agenda get caught four to
[37:47.320 --> 37:52.240]  eight years later there's a peaceful political revolt the Democrats are put
[37:52.240 --> 37:57.200]  in and then four to eight years later the Republicans are put back in they
[37:57.200 --> 38:05.080]  lean on each other they share power in this endless dance it's choreographed at
[38:05.080 --> 38:08.800]  the highest level sure Democrats and Republicans fight sometime over who gets
[38:08.800 --> 38:12.920]  committee chairmanship sir who gets power who gets political contributions and
[38:12.920 --> 38:18.920]  they attack each other sometimes with scandals but it's all contained on the
[38:18.920 --> 38:28.120]  football field on the stage it is an event a staged event in total because
[38:28.120 --> 38:33.600]  there are many things that they're not allowed to talk about world government
[38:33.600 --> 38:39.920]  corrupt corporations Pentagon corruption government looting police
[38:39.920 --> 38:44.400]  corruption they keep that off limits and sell you the idea that government sure
[38:44.400 --> 38:47.920]  God government's going to save you when Republicans get in office government
[38:47.920 --> 38:51.560]  gets bigger tramples more of the Constitution the Democrats get in
[38:51.560 --> 38:56.440]  government gets bigger they trample the Constitution I know you know this but
[38:56.440 --> 39:00.360]  the point is you may have known this decades ago the general public is just
[39:00.360 --> 39:05.520]  now beginning to realize this and realizing there's a problem it's kind
[39:05.520 --> 39:09.800]  of like when you got an old house say your grandma dies and you go out there
[39:09.800 --> 39:12.640]  to see the old house she was living in your decide whether to sell it or not
[39:12.640 --> 39:15.760]  and you put your arm up against the side of it while you're talking to your
[39:15.760 --> 39:20.000]  neighbor and the your arm goes through the wall termites and you pull your arm
[39:20.000 --> 39:24.640]  out and you go oh there's termites this house is rotten the question is how
[39:24.640 --> 39:29.800]  rotten is it well I've gone in as a termite exterminator and I've actually
[39:29.800 --> 39:34.400]  inspected the house and then let me tell you every board the roof the
[39:34.400 --> 39:39.800]  foundation everything is rotten the house is condemned termites have eaten
[39:39.800 --> 39:46.400]  everything the roof is sagging walls are sagging one big wind it's going to fall
[39:46.400 --> 39:51.320]  over and the globalists want all the nation states that they suck dry and
[39:51.320 --> 39:56.080]  engineered into their hands to collapse when they want in in a staged
[39:56.080 --> 40:02.280]  progression incrementally into their hands and into the world government no
[40:02.280 --> 40:09.120]  no the termites have convinced us to build them a new house of world
[40:09.120 --> 40:15.520]  government and they've now convinced us to move them into the new house and I'm
[40:15.520 --> 40:19.240]  saying no we're not going to move into the new termites house and we're not
[40:19.240 --> 40:23.000]  going to move the termites into the new house we're not going along with what
[40:23.000 --> 40:28.040]  you've done we are going to identify you as termites and we are going to expose
[40:28.040 --> 40:32.440]  you as termites and we are going to remove you and bring you to justice as
[40:32.440 --> 40:43.120]  the big fat greedy termites you are I was like 11 years old one summer for a
[40:43.120 --> 40:48.520]  month I worked with one of my cousins who was a termite exterminator for a
[40:48.520 --> 40:53.760]  month and I tell you we climb underneath those houses we'd go in we'd see
[40:53.760 --> 40:57.040]  houses sometimes so damaged by termites we just tell them you're gonna have to
[40:57.040 --> 41:00.200]  get the insurance company in here and have half this house torn out and
[41:00.200 --> 41:04.120]  repaired I mean there's really nothing you can do we can poison the termites
[41:04.120 --> 41:08.280]  that are here but this house is ruined and we need to come to grips with that
[41:08.280 --> 41:15.520]  whatever solutions the termites give us for health care or the borders or wars
[41:15.520 --> 41:22.920]  or national security or terrorism or the flu anything the termites do is going
[41:22.920 --> 41:28.520]  to be to the detriment of society because they're termites well it's an
[41:28.520 --> 41:36.800]  old African or is in the old Middle Eastern proverb of the frog and he's
[41:36.800 --> 41:40.800]  sitting there by the river and the scorpion comes over and he says hey
[41:40.800 --> 41:45.120]  will you let me on your back and take me across the river no you're a nice
[41:45.120 --> 41:48.960]  frog you're friendly that's your nature you're nice and the frog says yeah my
[41:48.960 --> 41:52.080]  nature is to be nice and friendly no you're a scorpion you'll sting me you'll
[41:52.080 --> 41:58.760]  kill me and the frog says so I'm not gonna carry across so the scorpion
[41:58.760 --> 42:04.760]  replies look I promise you I'm not gonna sting you be my friend you know you were
[42:04.760 --> 42:07.360]  gonna swim across anyways I see you looking at the other side of the bank
[42:07.360 --> 42:11.400]  some big tasty flies over there why don't you just let me on your back and
[42:11.400 --> 42:16.720]  carry me across and I promise I won't sting you so the frog says okay I want
[42:16.720 --> 42:20.160]  to be nice I've got a sweet nature go ahead and climb on my back I'm gonna
[42:20.160 --> 42:26.640]  swim across and let you ride on my back and so they get to the other side the
[42:26.640 --> 42:30.560]  frog sitting there at the edge of the water with his front feet up on the on
[42:30.560 --> 42:35.160]  the bank and the scorpion climbs off and gets on the other side of the bank and
[42:35.160 --> 42:39.600]  stings him and the frog is an incredible pain rolls over on his back and he says
[42:39.600 --> 42:43.560]  to the scorpion and his dying words why did you sting me you promised you
[42:43.560 --> 42:52.640]  promised and the scorpion said I'm a scorpion I mean this is so elementary the
[42:52.640 --> 42:57.760]  founding fathers taught us history teaches us common sense shows us you
[42:57.760 --> 43:04.280]  get a big government it will be taken over by criminals that normally big
[43:04.280 --> 43:07.520]  governments are started and pushed by criminals because they want power and to
[43:07.520 --> 43:15.920]  rob you but let's just say in some fantasy land Alex in Wonderland let's
[43:15.920 --> 43:23.720]  just say in this fantasy world that government could be big and helpful and
[43:23.720 --> 43:27.720]  angelic handing out free goodies taking it from the haves and giving it to the
[43:27.720 --> 43:31.360]  have nots that's how they always sell it to the general public the Soviet system
[43:31.360 --> 43:36.040]  and Nazi system everything oh we're gonna give you something free just give us
[43:36.040 --> 43:39.800]  the power to steal from others we won't keep it ourselves we're gonna give it to
[43:39.800 --> 43:46.240]  you so let's just say magically you could get a good government that was big
[43:46.240 --> 43:49.360]  good government big enough to give anything you want big enough to take
[43:49.360 --> 43:55.240]  everything away from you it's been said many times truthfully and accurately
[43:55.240 --> 44:06.160]  over time even if you had a good big government which doesn't exist just like
[44:06.160 --> 44:13.760]  a moon made of cheese doesn't exist even if you had that unknown quantity that
[44:13.760 --> 44:18.960]  unknown country that unknown alchemist substance of a good big government it
[44:18.960 --> 44:27.240]  will be taken over by tyrants in course we had a good small government and it
[44:27.240 --> 44:32.760]  still wasn't perfect at a lot of bad things to select groups but it was
[44:32.760 --> 44:35.440]  better than anything had ever been seen in the history of the world and it
[44:35.440 --> 44:42.520]  produced more patents and more science and more wealth and more intelligence and
[44:42.520 --> 44:45.760]  strength than any other country ever had that was the United States but
[44:45.760 --> 44:55.400]  empires countries nations systems through entropy always become corrupt and it
[44:55.400 --> 45:00.520]  became corrupt and now it is the biggest meanest most corrupt system on the
[45:00.520 --> 45:04.760]  planet completely predatory the globalists compete with each other on who
[45:04.760 --> 45:11.800]  can be more ruthless who can be more cunning they have their own methodologies
[45:11.800 --> 45:17.560]  their own rationalizations their own corporate cultures they are piratical
[45:17.560 --> 45:27.520]  monsters and anything that comes out of this government that is pushed by the
[45:27.520 --> 45:31.160]  establishment sometimes the people push something through this constitutional
[45:31.160 --> 45:36.680]  and it's good but that's maybe one out of a hundred things that happens the best
[45:36.680 --> 45:40.680]  we can hope for is you just block new outrages because finally they've been
[45:40.680 --> 45:46.320]  exposed for the crooks they are the best we can do is try to have criminal
[45:46.320 --> 45:50.080]  indictments continue to expose these people continue to educate the general
[45:50.080 --> 45:55.160]  public education of the public about who their true enemies are and the true
[45:55.160 --> 45:59.480]  nature of the world is the number one tool we have against these people it's
[45:59.480 --> 46:05.840]  the number one solution identifying the enemy identifying the system identifying
[46:05.840 --> 46:13.560]  the rules of the game the rigged game so that then people stop playing the game
[46:14.600 --> 46:20.520]  not being a nation in a world of spectators but being a nation in a world
[46:20.520 --> 46:26.720]  of critical thinkers and now is our moment of truth they plan this year for
[46:26.720 --> 46:30.960]  total blanket amnesty doesn't matter of over 90% of Americans and major polls
[46:30.960 --> 46:34.800]  are against it they're gonna try they are attempting to pass the government
[46:34.800 --> 46:38.160]  takeover of health care right now it doesn't matter of it destroys the
[46:38.160 --> 46:43.560]  Democratic Party they're bought and paid for you watch the Republicans aren't
[46:43.560 --> 46:48.360]  gonna repeal it when they get an office unless we truly inform the general
[46:48.360 --> 46:53.760]  public about the rigged game and that is happening that's the good news because
[46:53.760 --> 46:58.560]  generally they can play partisan politics and and play little tricks like
[46:58.560 --> 47:03.480]  it in 1913 having the private banks that own the Federal Reserve system they
[47:03.480 --> 47:10.360]  were trying to pass say that they were against the Federal Reserve system and
[47:10.360 --> 47:15.120]  so the public got snuckered but still that wasn't enough the whole public
[47:15.120 --> 47:20.760]  didn't get snuckered bamboozled conned and so they still had to have a
[47:20.760 --> 47:29.280]  handful of senators on Christmas Eve pass it and they're doing the same thing
[47:29.280 --> 47:34.920]  now they've paid out all these bribes they've engaged in all these payoffs to
[47:34.920 --> 47:38.880]  senators and house members totally illegal they've written the bill where
[47:38.880 --> 47:44.440]  it's selectively enforced where major unions are exempt but small companies
[47:44.440 --> 47:47.720]  and businesses and sole proprietors ships aren't totally unconstitutional
[47:47.720 --> 47:54.800]  unjust weights and measures it's unequal it's like saying blacks can't go to the
[47:54.800 --> 48:04.880]  water fountain or the bathroom or the lunch counter and they tried to come out
[48:04.880 --> 48:08.240]  and say the insurance companies are against these bills for health care
[48:08.240 --> 48:13.200]  takeover when they wrote them and now the left and the right have finally read
[48:13.200 --> 48:17.920]  the bills and understand the right needs to understand this isn't some commie
[48:17.920 --> 48:22.960]  socialist takeover of health care this is a banker controlled through the
[48:22.960 --> 48:31.680]  insurance company looting it's actually the democrats howard dean and others
[48:33.200 --> 48:37.680]  that are telling the truth I was on raw story this morning big liberal website
[48:37.680 --> 48:46.560]  about how the health care bill is a scam and every single commenter was going
[48:46.560 --> 48:50.600]  I'm a liberal and this is a rip off to the insurance companies this raises my
[48:50.600 --> 48:56.200]  taxes and cuts my benefits this is a scam this is tyranny every single
[48:56.200 --> 49:01.120]  commenter there were 30 something commenters the story just gone up and I
[49:01.120 --> 49:05.280]  read them all and every stink in one of them understood the banks are criminal
[49:05.280 --> 49:08.520]  that it's a world government that it's a new world order they were in there
[49:08.520 --> 49:13.920]  saying that and then I went to republican sites against it they got it
[49:13.920 --> 49:17.760]  they said this is banks looting us robbing us they weren't calling it
[49:17.760 --> 49:21.600]  tree hugging liberals trying to get something free that's how it's always
[49:21.600 --> 49:28.920]  sold and that's bad enough no this is going to go into the pockets of
[49:28.920 --> 49:32.600]  Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and others they're the ones that own and control the
[49:32.600 --> 49:42.080]  insurance companies they wrote the bill and it is so exciting to see the fact
[49:42.080 --> 49:45.600]  that even if they pass this it will continue to shadow the left right
[49:45.600 --> 49:49.800]  paradigm and we will get control of our congress and we will repeal and the
[49:49.800 --> 49:55.280]  states are fighting the unconstitutional provisions already before the bill even
[49:55.280 --> 50:00.480]  passes attorney generals are lining up in 18 states the people are finally
[50:00.480 --> 50:12.240]  getting it I mean here are some of the news articles today labor angry over
[50:12.240 --> 50:18.800]  Obama backed insurance tax if you got a nice health care plan they're gonna tax
[50:18.800 --> 50:22.600]  it I thought the point of health care was that your employer provide good
[50:22.600 --> 50:28.800]  health care as part of your benefits Dodd health reform bill hanging by a
[50:28.800 --> 50:37.520]  thread as democrats realize it is suicide politically to go for this and I
[50:37.520 --> 50:43.880]  have other articles along the same lines and so the people are finally
[50:43.880 --> 50:49.600]  figuring it out the democrats are finally figuring it out they're finally
[50:49.600 --> 50:52.880]  understanding that both parties are controlled republicans are finally
[50:52.880 --> 50:58.080]  figuring it out this is a huge realignment away from both parties and
[50:58.080 --> 51:04.040]  towards the Constitution when you hear the words water purification what comes

[1:00:12.640 --> 1:00:20.200]  he he's alex jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:20.200 --> 1:00:31.040]  alex jones well a lot of you know him from Jesse Ventura's top rated show on
[1:00:31.040 --> 1:00:37.200]  true TV I recommended him for the research episode secret societies global
[1:00:37.200 --> 1:00:43.080]  death plot and I believe that's his maiden voyage on national television and
[1:00:43.080 --> 1:00:47.240]  it's his first time joining us here on the radio for this hour perhaps a
[1:00:47.240 --> 1:00:50.680]  little bit in the next hour we're gonna be playing key audio clips that he
[1:00:50.680 --> 1:00:54.840]  recorded at conferences he attended and put on he was the head of many of these
[1:00:54.840 --> 1:00:59.560]  high-powered conferences with Rothschild's Rockefellers morey strong and
[1:00:59.560 --> 1:01:06.080]  so joining us is George Washington Hunt served as a naval officer consultant to
[1:01:06.080 --> 1:01:11.040]  major companies headed up by with the world conservation societies world
[1:01:11.040 --> 1:01:15.200]  conservation bank was a big part of that working with the United Nations he's
[1:01:15.200 --> 1:01:20.960]  done so much out of the gates there I just want mr. Hunt to give us a nut
[1:01:20.960 --> 1:01:26.360]  shell overview a thumbnail sketch of himself how he got involved with these
[1:01:26.360 --> 1:01:29.920]  groups then how he woke up to what they were really doing not just in their
[1:01:29.920 --> 1:01:34.240]  speeches but the on-the-side meetings and discussions of the establishment of
[1:01:34.240 --> 1:01:38.440]  world government through phony environmentalism so George Hunt it's
[1:01:38.440 --> 1:01:42.880]  great to have you here with us today I'm glad to be here Alex every chance I get
[1:01:42.880 --> 1:01:49.880]  to spread the bad news that's my job well you know people sometimes so I went
[1:01:49.880 --> 1:01:57.120]  to the fourth world wilderness Congress at September 11th 1987 I went there
[1:01:57.120 --> 1:02:03.560]  because my son has been killed in a wilderness area the later part of the
[1:02:03.560 --> 1:02:12.080]  year or about a few months before and I was very very sad and also my other son
[1:02:12.080 --> 1:02:19.320]  that was still living said he wanted to repair huts along the Arctic for travelers
[1:02:19.320 --> 1:02:24.040]  and he wanted to get into a job so I heard the fourth world wilderness coming
[1:02:24.040 --> 1:02:28.920]  to town and with all its reindeer and pretty little bright lights and I said
[1:02:28.920 --> 1:02:33.080]  you know maybe I could go there and rub shoulders with the smokies with the
[1:02:33.080 --> 1:02:38.720]  forest rangers and get my son a job and so I went down to the Congress and I
[1:02:38.720 --> 1:02:44.320]  saw the pictures of the reindeer and so on but then I noticed on the program that
[1:02:44.320 --> 1:02:49.920]  there was another aspect away from Denver she had the first two days of this
[1:02:49.920 --> 1:02:56.040]  wilderness can be Congress supposed to be pro conservation the first two days
[1:02:56.040 --> 1:03:02.880]  were Denver and then they moved a quasi-secret meeting up to the YMCA of
[1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:13.960]  of Estes Park, Colorado so with my resourceful mind I said to myself I'd like
[1:03:13.960 --> 1:03:19.720]  to get into that Congress but I didn't have any money and then low and behold I
[1:03:19.720 --> 1:03:25.440]  got the information that one of the special official hosts of the meeting
[1:03:25.440 --> 1:03:31.720]  what it was ill with the flu I got his number I called him he says yeah take my
[1:03:31.720 --> 1:03:38.400]  place I was interviewed by about four four people among among them were
[1:03:38.400 --> 1:03:43.920]  psychics and they approved me as an official host and that shows how weird
[1:03:43.920 --> 1:03:47.840]  these groups are because Maury Strong also has a wilderness retreat like
[1:03:47.840 --> 1:03:51.480]  Bohemian Grove similar where they admittedly do a lot of bizarre
[1:03:51.480 --> 1:03:55.600]  activities so so everywhere they go there's always psychics and the occult
[1:03:55.600 --> 1:04:01.600]  involved yes well they were involved here too Alex they all run together the
[1:04:01.600 --> 1:04:12.160]  psychics the occult the witches the devils the the the near-rich that want
[1:04:12.160 --> 1:04:16.520]  to get into the crowd it's a whole mish-mash and there's video of this that
[1:04:16.520 --> 1:04:20.560]  you shot I mean it over time you became the leader of the conferences and we're
[1:04:20.560 --> 1:04:24.000]  gonna get into that how these twists of fate got you in this position so we're
[1:04:24.000 --> 1:04:29.880]  going to break in a moment let's come back with George Hine goes he wants to
[1:04:29.880 --> 1:04:34.040]  spot at this event this conservation event you end up getting one of the
[1:04:34.040 --> 1:04:38.480]  places of one of the host and then suddenly you're with Rothschild's
[1:04:38.480 --> 1:04:43.200]  Rockefellers how did this happen you're approved by psychics to be able to go
[1:04:43.200 --> 1:04:48.080]  by them I mean it just goes on and on and on and I've done separate research
[1:04:48.080 --> 1:04:54.120]  from George Hine confirming what he said about Maury strong and others they
[1:04:54.120 --> 1:04:58.960]  want a one-world religion as Al Gore is now openly saying we'll be right back
[1:04:58.960 --> 1:05:03.400]  with George Hine this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider
[1:05:03.400 --> 1:05:07.680]  buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[1:05:07.680 --> 1:05:11.880]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[1:05:11.880 --> 1:05:15.760]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[1:05:15.760 --> 1:05:19.440]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[1:05:19.440 --> 1:05:24.000]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[1:05:24.000 --> 1:05:28.040]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[1:05:28.040 --> 1:05:31.840]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[1:05:31.840 --> 1:05:35.440]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[1:05:35.440 --> 1:05:39.800]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[1:05:39.800 --> 1:05:42.960]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power
[1:05:42.960 --> 1:05:46.600]  generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors you

[1:08:20.480 --> 1:08:25.440]  country country country we're talking about a global type money making thing
[1:08:25.440 --> 1:08:33.200]  correct yes we're talking about a powerful immense aristocracy that is that

[1:08:47.840 --> 1:08:53.040]  wilderness congress when he met marie strong in 1987 the congress is an
[1:08:53.040 --> 1:08:57.040]  international forum for discussing the environment
[1:08:57.040 --> 1:09:00.320]  but marie strong showed up to introduce a new player
[1:09:00.320 --> 1:09:05.520]  financier edmund a Rothschild of the Rothschild banking dynasty
[1:09:05.520 --> 1:09:11.600]  and the proposal to create something called a world conservation bank
[1:09:11.600 --> 1:09:18.320]  one of the most important initiatives that is open here is that of the
[1:09:18.320 --> 1:09:23.520]  conservation banking program we have is our chairman fortunately the person who
[1:09:23.520 --> 1:09:27.600]  epitomizes that positive synthesis between environment
[1:09:27.600 --> 1:09:32.240]  conservation on the one hand and economics on the other
[1:09:32.240 --> 1:09:35.360]  and i'm just delighted to have this opportunity of

[1:09:44.800 --> 1:09:49.360]  movement but he was also edmund the Rothschild's
[1:09:49.360 --> 1:09:54.000]  right hand man you have money and the environment

[1:10:15.520 --> 1:10:20.560]  jobs for his son uh one of the presenters is sick
[1:10:20.560 --> 1:10:24.560]  he says i'd like to go suddenly he's being vetted by them
[1:10:24.560 --> 1:10:28.000]  by psychics and from my separate research is on record

[1:12:07.280 --> 1:12:11.120]  of course he didn't call on me it was a contrived congress
[1:12:11.120 --> 1:12:16.000]  and they accepted the bank and we haven't seen it yet but it's coming down the
[1:12:16.000 --> 1:12:20.160]  road if there'll be one bank one credit card
[1:12:20.160 --> 1:12:25.280]  one of everything and if you cross that bank and don't do what they want or the
[1:12:25.280 --> 1:12:30.080]  owners want you'll lose your credit card privilege and you won't be able to buy
[1:12:30.080 --> 1:12:36.960]  or sell now let's fast forward 24 years or 23 years to 2010
[1:12:36.960 --> 1:12:40.240]  i now have london guardian associated press headlines
[1:12:40.240 --> 1:12:43.440]  roth child's established global environment bank
[1:12:43.440 --> 1:12:46.640]  roth child's established global carbon credit bank
[1:12:46.640 --> 1:12:51.120]  it's now mainstream news what you whistle blew on decades ago
[1:12:51.120 --> 1:12:53.680]  after you got deeper into the groups we're going to cover that
[1:12:53.680 --> 1:12:57.280]  that they were going to establish all this and everything you said
[1:12:57.280 --> 1:13:00.640]  of course you also released the documents and video and audio
[1:13:00.640 --> 1:13:05.280]  but everything you talked about was going to happen is now actually happening
[1:13:05.280 --> 1:13:10.800]  yes that's what i want people to wake up at this is a conspiracy going on it's
[1:13:10.800 --> 1:13:16.080]  no longer a conspiracy theory it's a conspiracy fact
[1:13:16.080 --> 1:13:19.280]  okay so continue so you're at the meeting you're at the table with the roth
[1:13:19.280 --> 1:13:22.240]  child's because by twist of fate you got the
[1:13:22.240 --> 1:13:26.480]  uh ticket or the seat of one of the presenters who had the flu go ahead
[1:13:26.480 --> 1:13:34.320]  then i then my fellow uh uh fellow workers came up to me and
[1:13:34.320 --> 1:13:37.600]  and they said george we have to talk to you about something
[1:13:37.600 --> 1:13:41.360]  david rockfeller has sent us a message that if you don't keep your mouth shut
[1:13:41.360 --> 1:13:45.600]  you're going to regret it shortly after that
[1:13:45.600 --> 1:13:49.840]  after the meeting i was talking with a top show host and he said did you get
[1:13:49.840 --> 1:13:53.920]  geane bar syndrome yet and i said what are you talking about
[1:13:53.920 --> 1:13:58.480]  he said gbs it seems like everyone that gets close to the bone with world order
[1:13:58.480 --> 1:14:02.400]  gets it well i just got out of the hospital with gbs
[1:14:02.400 --> 1:14:06.960]  so there's something there don't you think oh we know they have a lot of
[1:14:06.960 --> 1:14:10.560]  programs with soft kill weapons but but expanding on this because you got the
[1:14:10.560 --> 1:14:15.520]  video out of there at other events so out of the gate so i got the tape of the
[1:14:15.520 --> 1:14:20.800]  events as far as i know it's the only tape in existence and i've seen video of
[1:14:20.800 --> 1:14:24.640]  them presenting audio of them presenting so so it looks like out of the gates
[1:14:24.640 --> 1:14:28.720]  and correct me if i'm wrong you were confrontational with them immediately
[1:14:28.720 --> 1:14:33.040]  maybe that's why they kept you around for a while trying to get control of you
[1:14:33.040 --> 1:14:36.400]  worried that you'd gotten into a secret meeting that you weren't supposed to be
[1:14:36.400 --> 1:14:40.000]  part of or why didn't they kick you out why did you get invited to more
[1:14:40.000 --> 1:14:44.080]  meetings i can't i can't figure that out
[1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:47.120]  uh... first of all i hadn't done anything wrong well
[1:14:47.120 --> 1:14:51.200]  i was an official host and i saw why was david rockefeller telling you to shut
[1:14:51.200 --> 1:14:54.400]  up the people why was there a regular uh...
[1:14:54.400 --> 1:15:00.000]  uh... regular uh... association with morris strong there
[1:15:00.000 --> 1:15:03.200]  come up again after the congress i went down
[1:15:03.200 --> 1:15:06.640]  uh... some christians down in sandals valley called me
[1:15:06.640 --> 1:15:10.560]  they said george you have to come down here morris strong is up to all kinds of
[1:15:10.560 --> 1:15:14.480]  trips and that's where i was able to through them
[1:15:14.480 --> 1:15:20.400]  expose morris strong's water scan that he was going to pump water to
[1:15:20.400 --> 1:15:24.080]  cities and turn the sand lewis valley thousands of miles
[1:15:24.080 --> 1:15:28.000]  into a dustbolt so here's the the convener
[1:15:28.000 --> 1:15:35.040]  of the environment congress that met in estus park going down 200 miles to the
[1:15:35.040 --> 1:15:39.040]  sand lewis valley and turning the place into a dustbolt
[1:15:39.040 --> 1:15:43.200]  it was that hypocrisy that caused me to invest
[1:15:43.200 --> 1:15:48.320]  up to now 250 thousand dollars in exposing this guy
[1:15:48.320 --> 1:15:51.840]  and i've got some information today for you
[1:15:51.840 --> 1:15:58.320]  that uh... it's going to blow him out of the water
[1:15:58.320 --> 1:16:02.880]  amazing so so again now we see it all over the news how the un and big
[1:16:02.880 --> 1:16:06.640]  corporations are grabbing up the water in the third world the first world
[1:16:06.640 --> 1:16:10.320]  developing world cutting it off that's now mainstream news
[1:16:10.320 --> 1:16:15.520]  here you are in the late eighties seeing this at its embryonic formation
[1:16:15.520 --> 1:16:22.160]  yes i saw it as an embryo and now i'm seeing this at ugly fetus
[1:16:22.160 --> 1:16:25.120]  now from the videos and audios i've seen of you
[1:16:25.120 --> 1:16:28.640]  uh... you you then found out about this will will continue with that first
[1:16:28.640 --> 1:16:32.000]  conference what they said we've got a bunch of audio clips here
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:38.160]  and then but but continue into other meetings that you were able to infiltrate
[1:16:38.160 --> 1:16:44.160]  oh i i've infiltrated many meetings but not one of of this importance
[1:16:44.160 --> 1:16:48.480]  because the secretary of the treasury baker was there the head of the imf the
[1:16:48.480 --> 1:16:52.000]  head of the world bank ross child edmund ross child
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:56.240]  the chief banker of the world uh... david rockefeller
[1:16:56.240 --> 1:16:59.520]  da da da da and i knew there was something going on
[1:16:59.520 --> 1:17:02.800]  it would take an idiot not to understand it
[1:17:02.800 --> 1:17:06.080]  and again your own record is being part of the conference you've got the
[1:17:06.080 --> 1:17:10.240]  document sound uh... later newspapers major newspapers have written
[1:17:10.240 --> 1:17:14.240]  stories about it on the major tv show they showed those
[1:17:14.240 --> 1:17:18.400]  i mean this was a stroke of uh... divine intervention
[1:17:18.400 --> 1:17:22.800]  it was god it was what you call an incident coincidence
[1:17:22.800 --> 1:17:26.560]  because i received a prophecy in the christian church about twelve years
[1:17:26.560 --> 1:17:30.160]  earlier that i was going to do this so it was
[1:17:30.160 --> 1:17:33.920]  it was a piece of cake i walked through it without any fear
[1:17:33.920 --> 1:17:38.320]  and knowing that god was on my side wait a minute so someone told you
[1:17:38.320 --> 1:17:41.920]  specifically or did you recognize what was happening as it was happening or
[1:17:41.920 --> 1:17:46.480]  did you like after the fact of oh my god it was later after the fact
[1:17:46.480 --> 1:17:50.480]  this is a prophecy we are going into the wilderness
[1:17:50.480 --> 1:17:54.640]  we are going on an adventure together into the wilderness
[1:17:54.640 --> 1:17:58.560]  uh... i am going to lose you up on the ravenous beast
[1:17:58.560 --> 1:18:02.000]  of the world and then you will return to me
[1:18:02.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  and i will protect you you i am your jailer for your good
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:10.320]  and mine and that was the prophecy and then after i went to the wilderness
[1:18:10.320 --> 1:18:13.120]  congress i realized i had been in the wilderness
[1:18:13.120 --> 1:18:17.760]  and he was loosening me up on the ravenous beast of the world
[1:18:17.760 --> 1:18:22.400]  i knew the face to face amazing now let's go back to this meeting though this
[1:18:22.400 --> 1:18:26.000]  key meeting you got into then you went and witnessed their sub-meetings

[1:25:11.120 --> 1:25:16.000]  harlem bruntland she prepared the bruntland report
[1:25:16.000 --> 1:25:22.560]  which was used as the basis of the fourth world vote in this congress
[1:25:22.560 --> 1:25:26.480]  foundation the bruntland report and her
[1:25:26.480 --> 1:25:31.440]  her analysis is that two billion people have to have to be removed
[1:25:31.440 --> 1:25:38.160]  from the planet two billion now there's other figures to go down as low as 500
[1:25:38.160 --> 1:25:43.840]  million uh so we have we have a a uh
[1:25:43.840 --> 1:25:47.840]  sinister element in our government that is
[1:25:47.840 --> 1:25:53.360]  twisting the law so that they can annihilate people early
[1:25:53.360 --> 1:25:56.960]  they say the globe the earth is not large enough
[1:25:56.960 --> 1:26:03.200]  for six billion people now i take issue with that because i'm one of the guys
[1:26:03.200 --> 1:26:08.160]  that will be cooked so you can see i do have a selfish motive in fighting all
[1:26:08.160 --> 1:26:11.520]  that stuff well plus it's a fraudulent model and
[1:26:11.520 --> 1:26:15.040]  it's been proven these globalists have bigger carbon footprints and more
[1:26:15.040 --> 1:26:18.320]  children than even third world populations i mean
[1:26:18.320 --> 1:26:22.160]  these are a bunch of greedy people that want the earth for themselves
[1:26:22.160 --> 1:26:26.800]  yes they want the earth for themselves that you got it right on the head
[1:26:26.800 --> 1:26:31.440]  and they don't like us cannon fodder that unfortunately populates the earth
[1:26:31.440 --> 1:26:35.360]  i've got a recording of that actually an elitist
[1:26:35.360 --> 1:26:39.520]  money uh banker from canada actually saying that
[1:26:39.520 --> 1:26:45.280]  let's uh let's do this without uh let's do this bank without telling the
[1:26:45.280 --> 1:26:50.480]  cannon fodder cannon fodder about it that unfortunately inhabits the earth
[1:26:50.480 --> 1:26:54.640]  that's when i said i'm gonna make war on these guys
[1:26:54.640 --> 1:26:58.880]  and i haven't stopped for 22 years
[1:26:58.960 --> 1:27:03.440]  well you've done a great job exposing them uh i want to continue here
[1:27:03.440 --> 1:27:08.800]  okay uh so how did the conference end and then what other conferences did you
[1:27:08.800 --> 1:27:14.000]  attend the okay the congress the congress ended
[1:27:14.000 --> 1:27:20.160]  by ross child presenting his banking program to the congress
[1:27:20.160 --> 1:27:24.640]  to grow our own brulean to present to the united nations
[1:27:24.640 --> 1:27:28.720]  in october of 1987
[1:27:29.920 --> 1:27:36.000]  that was the end of it now since then uh you know everyone's complaining about
[1:27:36.000 --> 1:27:42.160]  morris strong allegedly taking a one billion or one million dollar bribe
[1:27:42.160 --> 1:27:47.280]  from the un and the oil for food program and and fox just uh
[1:27:47.280 --> 1:27:53.600]  just uh uh uh for fouled him up by by exposing him
[1:27:53.600 --> 1:27:59.120]  to the new world to that uh to the copenhagen congress he made billions
[1:27:59.120 --> 1:28:02.560]  there and i'll announce it to you right now
[1:28:02.560 --> 1:28:07.120]  he got eight million dollars when he sold the vodka
[1:28:07.120 --> 1:28:11.120]  for water lot rights which he did not own
[1:28:11.120 --> 1:28:16.720]  in other words it seems to me that there was fraud committed either at the
[1:28:16.720 --> 1:28:22.240]  nature conservancy uh level or uh cabesa de vaca
[1:28:22.240 --> 1:28:25.840]  land company level but someone can easily find that
[1:28:25.840 --> 1:28:30.560]  eight million dollars that he got and uh i i hereby
[1:28:30.560 --> 1:28:34.240]  blow the whistle on it well here's that fox news report on global
[1:28:34.240 --> 1:28:39.200]  warming follow the money and it talks about morris strong and
[1:28:39.200 --> 1:28:42.960]  everything he's been involved in and i know these fake conservancy grips in
[1:28:42.960 --> 1:28:46.080]  austin with the city took more than 15 000 acres
[1:28:46.080 --> 1:28:49.200]  from people and didn't pay him one tenth of what it was worth
[1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:52.480]  then they turned around a few years later and took the restrictions off
[1:28:52.480 --> 1:28:57.280]  and built on it themselves see that's the kind of stuff they do they maneuver
[1:28:57.280 --> 1:29:00.160]  themselves through these institutions and
[1:29:00.160 --> 1:29:05.680]  uh and uh acronymical uh corporations like abc
[1:29:05.680 --> 1:29:09.040]  corporation and you can't follow their trail
[1:29:09.040 --> 1:29:13.200]  morris strong tried to bury his trail when he left
[1:29:13.200 --> 1:29:19.040]  the united states in a hurry because i i reported him to the congress
[1:29:19.040 --> 1:29:23.120]  for for tacking a rider on to the quadrennial
[1:29:23.120 --> 1:29:27.600]  water bill that would allow growth and development to use the aquifers
[1:29:27.600 --> 1:29:33.040]  uh and he and that that issue which would have passed if i hadn't written to
[1:29:33.040 --> 1:29:37.120]  the congressman until 2 a.m in the morning if i hadn't
[1:29:37.120 --> 1:29:40.720]  written to them they would have passed it and uh
[1:29:40.720 --> 1:29:44.400]  awdi morris strong's company would have been
[1:29:44.400 --> 1:29:48.880]  often rolling to uh george stay there good job fighting that

[1:34:00.000 --> 1:34:04.160]  take on that as well but for years he was exposing
[1:34:04.160 --> 1:34:08.880]  morris strong before it ever even became a mainstream media
[1:34:08.880 --> 1:34:14.640]  issue but give me a document cam shot for prisonplanet.tv viewers and for

[1:34:24.400 --> 1:34:29.360]  Copenhagen so that's going on here's a article of Reuters
[1:34:29.360 --> 1:34:33.040]  Rothschild e3 launched carbon credit investment fund
[1:34:33.040 --> 1:34:36.560]  that people will pay their taxes to that's Reuters
[1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:40.400]  everything he was talking about 20 years ago
[1:34:40.400 --> 1:34:43.760]  here's another one morris strong linked to all these bizarre
[1:34:43.760 --> 1:34:48.400]  cults we're going to be covering that with him as well his wife
[1:34:48.400 --> 1:34:52.080]  setting up a gaya earth religion the un set in 96
[1:34:52.080 --> 1:34:56.000]  and their biological diversity assessment and i even have a clip of them at the
[1:34:56.000 --> 1:34:59.440]  un saying we must worship our mother goddess
[1:34:59.440 --> 1:35:02.640]  and now they're teaching the children these chants and public schools and
[1:35:02.640 --> 1:35:05.520]  private schools that are accredited and they now admit it's going to be a
[1:35:05.520 --> 1:35:09.360]  global religion in fact where are those magazines
[1:35:09.360 --> 1:35:11.680]  i had in here i guess i've already cleaned it up will you ask
[1:35:11.680 --> 1:35:14.000]  erin because he took them out no no no here they are
[1:35:14.000 --> 1:35:18.800]  here they are look at this there's so many of these i just thought to show you
[1:35:18.800 --> 1:35:23.840]  this here is outside magazine likening the new
[1:35:23.840 --> 1:35:28.000]  heir of the Rothschild family the son of the person that
[1:35:28.000 --> 1:35:35.440]  that george hunt was exposing here he is the hero gene how to tap into yours
[1:35:35.440 --> 1:35:40.080]  and then you open it up and it talks about him being like jesus
[1:35:40.080 --> 1:35:44.480]  you open it up and it talks about him being a
[1:35:44.480 --> 1:35:49.040]  christ figure i mean this is just so
[1:35:49.040 --> 1:35:53.200]  incredibly sickening they're calling jesus here give me a close shot of this
[1:35:53.200 --> 1:36:00.160]  plastics jesus the savior how to be a hero
[1:36:00.320 --> 1:36:04.560]  and again here they are on the cover of the magazine the hero gene
[1:36:04.560 --> 1:36:08.640]  how to tap into yours this is your role model the guy that got on my show
[1:36:08.640 --> 1:36:11.520]  he's openly called for global government by the way at Copenhagen on
[1:36:11.520 --> 1:36:15.040]  Bloomberg tv a guy who got on my show and i said well mars's
[1:36:15.040 --> 1:36:19.280]  ice caps have been getting smaller too from solar system warming from the sun
[1:36:19.280 --> 1:36:21.680]  and he said well that's because mars is closer
[1:36:21.680 --> 1:36:25.280]  to the sun than earth and i said no it's not it's the next planet out
[1:36:25.280 --> 1:36:28.240]  then it's the gas giants he said no it's not and laughed at me
[1:36:28.240 --> 1:36:31.680]  he was laughing at the audience he thinks you're like the general public
[1:36:31.680 --> 1:36:36.560]  here's another one the thinking man's thinking man the eco-profit gets real
[1:36:36.560 --> 1:36:42.240]  al gore see he's a prophet it's all a religion but that's coming up and he's
[1:36:42.240 --> 1:36:44.720]  gonna be with us at least 20 minutes to the next hour because there's so many
[1:36:44.720 --> 1:36:47.680]  facets to cover george hop before we get into the religious
[1:36:47.680 --> 1:36:52.320]  angle and the scams they're running i want to play some audio clips and get
[1:36:52.320 --> 1:36:54.720]  into some of the other questions you sent me that you think
[1:36:54.720 --> 1:36:59.280]  are important to get into but get working with them being around them
[1:36:59.280 --> 1:37:02.320]  and finding out who they were tracking them
[1:37:02.320 --> 1:37:07.680]  what is their bottom line i mean i don't know if you've seen my film in game but
[1:37:07.680 --> 1:37:12.080]  uh... from the u n documents from their statements it's a planetary dictatorship
[1:37:12.080 --> 1:37:14.960]  to then carry out the orderly extermination of at least 80 percent
[1:37:14.960 --> 1:37:18.000]  of the world population
[1:37:18.000 --> 1:37:22.880]  you know you caught me uh... uh... at a standstill i'm not
[1:37:22.880 --> 1:37:27.920]  familiar with with that well i need to send you a copy of my film in game
[1:37:27.920 --> 1:37:32.000]  but specifically there their plans for population reduction did you ever run
[1:37:32.000 --> 1:37:33.920]  into that
[1:37:33.920 --> 1:37:38.160]  well um... i have yes i have but uh...
[1:37:38.160 --> 1:37:43.600]  uh... it's rather grim i believe that uh... world health organization has
[1:37:43.600 --> 1:37:46.720]  been uh... has uh...
[1:37:46.720 --> 1:37:52.960]  included a of eight virus into their inoculations that they're doing for the
[1:37:52.960 --> 1:37:56.800]  good of mankind of course uh... and that's why we're seeing
[1:37:56.800 --> 1:38:00.560]  the population dying of AIDS in africa
[1:38:00.560 --> 1:38:04.400]  uh... uh... they've been caught yes that's on record a sister country of
[1:38:04.400 --> 1:38:08.320]  rwanda said the bank credit leone's
[1:38:08.320 --> 1:38:12.640]  uh... they've since gone out of business but they're the ones that finance
[1:38:12.640 --> 1:38:17.600]  the rwandan massacre they sent it to the president of rwanda
[1:38:17.600 --> 1:38:22.240]  who was working with them and uh... you know i come across these terrible
[1:38:22.240 --> 1:38:26.000]  things that are going on in the planet even while we speak
[1:38:26.000 --> 1:38:30.480]  terrible well we know the u n was involved in financing the rwandan
[1:38:30.480 --> 1:38:33.520]  massacre of christians because they wanted their property for big oil
[1:38:33.520 --> 1:38:37.760]  companies and mining companies uh... and uh... financed by banks
[1:38:37.760 --> 1:38:41.360]  uh... not particularly uh... familiar with the bank you mentioned but
[1:38:41.360 --> 1:38:45.440]  what type of world do they want to build and how are they using
[1:38:45.440 --> 1:38:50.000]  environmentalism to sell the public on giving up their rights
[1:38:50.000 --> 1:38:50.960]  they are
[1:38:50.960 --> 1:38:56.560]  gearing society towards a feudalistic society in my opinion
[1:38:56.560 --> 1:39:01.440]  where they'll have lords of the manners uh... the duchess of uh...
[1:39:01.440 --> 1:39:06.640]  boulder and uh... and and the queen of las vegas uh... you know they'll
[1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:10.560]  they'll adapt they'll adopt titles and stuff they'll go into a
[1:39:10.560 --> 1:39:16.160]  a feudalistic society similar to what we had in the middle ages
[1:39:16.160 --> 1:39:20.640]  and uh... they will also introduce the worship of mother earth as part of the
[1:39:20.640 --> 1:39:24.560]  religion uh... so that we will somehow
[1:39:24.560 --> 1:39:29.440]  tie in the religion with acceptance of the world order
[1:39:29.440 --> 1:39:34.320]  uh... that's all i can say vaguely about where they're headed
[1:39:34.320 --> 1:39:37.920]  now i've got these audio clips and then i want to get into
[1:39:37.920 --> 1:39:42.000]  some of their religious beliefs and and and i mean having psychics
[1:39:42.000 --> 1:39:45.440]  vet you to be able to go to the conference uh... the secret conference
[1:39:45.440 --> 1:39:49.440]  i mean just the bizarreness that sounds crazy to people that don't research them
[1:39:49.440 --> 1:39:54.160]  but openly u n documents talk about the occult and how much they believe in it
[1:39:54.160 --> 1:39:57.920]  uh... what would you how would you sum up their earth religion
[1:39:57.920 --> 1:40:01.680]  and because that's a broad title earth religion we see the new movie avatar
[1:40:01.680 --> 1:40:06.400]  it's all about a earth religion uh... but but i i mean how would you sum up
[1:40:06.400 --> 1:40:09.760]  their their earth religion
[1:40:09.760 --> 1:40:13.520]  strong morey strong's wife
[1:40:13.520 --> 1:40:18.640]  is the head of the earth religion cult uh... she at the crest on colorado has
[1:40:18.640 --> 1:40:23.360]  been chosen as a center because that is where the eastern religions
[1:40:23.360 --> 1:40:27.440]  meet the western religions they say that's the point there
[1:40:27.440 --> 1:40:31.520]  where god is going to uh... going to have
[1:40:31.520 --> 1:40:37.360]  sexual intercourse with mother earth to bring forth
[1:40:37.360 --> 1:40:43.040]  the christ that's what they believe
[1:40:43.040 --> 1:40:46.320]  hello
[1:40:46.320 --> 1:40:52.320]  did i knock you off your seat no no it's i mean i'm listening
[1:40:52.320 --> 1:40:55.680]  okay no no no i mean i've been to bohemian grove i infiltrated it and
[1:40:55.680 --> 1:40:59.840]  they address the owl as an owl then as a bull as molik
[1:40:59.840 --> 1:41:03.600]  they address it as male and female the owl is the female
[1:41:03.600 --> 1:41:06.720]  uh... and the cults are all a little bit different
[1:41:06.720 --> 1:41:11.040]  and then the bull is the male and they talk about how they sacrifice children
[1:41:11.040 --> 1:41:16.800]  and goodly tire that's a quote to uh... the uh... molik the bull but then they
[1:41:16.800 --> 1:41:21.920]  also address it as a female and so they always see it as the horn god the male
[1:41:21.920 --> 1:41:25.840]  and then the female and they address it as that
[1:41:25.840 --> 1:41:28.960]  and and they believe in this illuminati balance
[1:41:28.960 --> 1:41:32.240]  uh... and that yes they kill but they also bring life
[1:41:32.240 --> 1:41:35.920]  and it's really just a rationale for all the things they do
[1:41:35.920 --> 1:41:39.440]  you know you've you've got the core of it right there alex
[1:41:39.440 --> 1:41:43.680]  uh... but it's starting in moray strong country
[1:41:43.680 --> 1:41:48.160]  and uh... we've learned already we can't trust him so you know that this
[1:41:48.160 --> 1:41:51.760]  religion and they will get it through you know the big brother
[1:41:51.760 --> 1:41:54.960]  religion uh... they will uh...
[1:41:54.960 --> 1:42:00.640]  process the minds of our children uh... in the school such as they have al gore
[1:42:00.640 --> 1:42:03.680]  rushing into the first grade to tell him how
[1:42:03.680 --> 1:42:07.120]  how the chicken licking stories about the earth
[1:42:07.120 --> 1:42:12.080]  is it's going to fall apart well he's also an audio at huge
[1:42:12.080 --> 1:42:16.160]  elementary school conferences and the auditorium saying
[1:42:16.160 --> 1:42:20.880]  tell your parents what to do they don't know you're the boss in the new york
[1:42:20.880 --> 1:42:23.440]  times reports they've got kids all over the country
[1:42:23.440 --> 1:42:26.880]  writing mock tickets to their parents for taking a hot bath
[1:42:26.880 --> 1:42:30.240]  that's what they're going to do they're going to train them to blow the whistle
[1:42:30.240 --> 1:42:33.520]  on their parents same thing that you read
[1:42:33.520 --> 1:42:41.120]  i i urge you listeners to reread 1984 there are a lot of parallels there
[1:42:41.120 --> 1:42:46.880]  and then including their earth religion they uh... in 1984 they worship big
[1:42:46.880 --> 1:42:51.760]  brother but uh... in this case it'll be big sister
[1:42:51.760 --> 1:42:54.720]  well we have another article at jonesreport.com
[1:42:54.720 --> 1:42:58.960]  that's a scan from this outside magazine article
[1:42:58.960 --> 1:43:03.600]  and it's got a photo of david the Rothschild wearing a skull and bones
[1:43:03.600 --> 1:43:06.800]  belt it says he's jesus but he's also wearing a
[1:43:06.800 --> 1:43:09.760]  skull and crossbones belt what do you think of that
[1:43:09.760 --> 1:43:15.360]  well as christian i i i would immediately be repulsed by it i don't
[1:43:15.360 --> 1:43:18.800]  know what he was uh... uh... saying to the public
[1:43:18.800 --> 1:43:22.320]  i don't know if he was mocking jesus christ like uh...
[1:43:22.320 --> 1:43:25.920]  some of uh... some of the orthodox jews do
[1:43:25.920 --> 1:43:32.960]  but uh... the uh... uh... the gist is that uh... they're out to capture the
[1:43:32.960 --> 1:43:38.320]  minds of people this is a mind game that we're involved in
[1:43:38.320 --> 1:43:42.800]  info wars yeah they use guilt over the environment to sell people
[1:43:42.800 --> 1:43:47.600]  into giving up their rights to them giving up their rights to the state
[1:43:47.600 --> 1:43:51.200]  but in this case to gaya mother earth
[1:43:51.200 --> 1:43:54.480]  and they'll be rewarded for it they'll get a razor blade
[1:43:54.480 --> 1:44:00.000]  uh... uh... ration that's special because they worship mother earth
[1:44:00.000 --> 1:44:04.080]  but if you don't worship mother earth you're toast
[1:44:04.080 --> 1:44:07.920]  by the way by the way or sell because the bank
[1:44:07.920 --> 1:44:11.520]  won't give you those privileges it all works together
[1:44:11.520 --> 1:44:14.720]  by the way i have for a very uh... uh...
[1:44:14.720 --> 1:44:20.080]  humongous society controlling us well going back to what you just said
[1:44:20.080 --> 1:44:24.720]  the bbc this weekend had a headline that i show people yesterday where they said
[1:44:24.720 --> 1:44:29.520]  rationing is needed a credit ration on your card like you said 20 years ago
[1:44:29.520 --> 1:44:33.200]  that they said now they're openly proposing you'll have a card
[1:44:33.200 --> 1:44:36.560]  and it has your rations on it for everyone for the earth
[1:44:36.560 --> 1:44:40.640]  every can of corn or beans will have a tax on it as well
[1:44:40.640 --> 1:44:44.480]  but even if you have the money to buy it you won't get it when your carbon
[1:44:44.480 --> 1:44:48.000]  credits run out i mean this is neo feudalism this is serfdom
[1:44:48.000 --> 1:44:52.880]  that's right they're going to tax each each can
[1:44:52.880 --> 1:44:58.400]  of beans or corn or whatever you have they're going to determine how much of
[1:44:58.400 --> 1:45:02.640]  mother earth went into the growth of this product
[1:45:02.640 --> 1:45:07.440]  and they're going to add that to the cost of the product
[1:45:07.440 --> 1:45:11.440]  as if life hurts life the whole process of life and death and
[1:45:11.440 --> 1:45:15.200]  regeneration of food is what the life cycle is by
[1:45:15.200 --> 1:45:19.520]  taxing carbon dioxide that plants breathe that all animals exhale
[1:45:19.520 --> 1:45:25.600]  they can corner the entire life cycle yeah that's what they say
[1:45:25.600 --> 1:45:30.400]  in fact ross child said that he wanted to capture all of the carbon dioxide
[1:45:30.400 --> 1:45:36.240]  turn it into dry ice and ship the dry ice to the polar caps to keep them from
[1:45:36.240 --> 1:45:40.000]  melting that of course he's going to take care of
[1:45:40.000 --> 1:45:43.600]  and of course he would make the money off of doing that
[1:45:43.600 --> 1:45:46.320]  excuse me go ahead and of course he would make the money off of that like
[1:45:46.320 --> 1:45:49.520]  bill gates patenting all this stuff to stop carbon dioxide
[1:45:49.520 --> 1:45:55.360]  oh yeah take a lot of dry dry ice to keep the polar caps from melting
[1:45:55.360 --> 1:45:59.680]  what about uh what about uh bill and melinda gates and their eugenics
[1:45:59.680 --> 1:46:03.760]  foundation do you ever run into that no i have uh the gates foundation
[1:46:03.760 --> 1:46:07.120]  yes i have run it i think it's a it's a pacific
[1:46:07.120 --> 1:46:11.120]  it's a passive organization that bill gates has
[1:46:11.120 --> 1:46:15.200]  he doesn't seem like he's a he's a killer or anything like that
[1:46:15.200 --> 1:46:18.800]  well we've done research on it it's carefully guarded and we've had some
[1:46:18.800 --> 1:46:21.520]  internal whistleblowers i mean you know his dad was the
[1:46:21.520 --> 1:46:26.160]  former head of plant parenthood and uh he is for population reduction and
[1:46:26.160 --> 1:46:30.160]  you know he's busy inoculating the little children
[1:46:30.160 --> 1:46:34.320]  oh didn't know that well there's a lot okay you've
[1:46:34.320 --> 1:46:37.440]  taught us and there's a lot you know that we all can teach each other here
[1:46:37.440 --> 1:46:41.840]  uh there's so much more to get into and your ideas of how to stop these people
[1:46:41.840 --> 1:46:44.560]  and and more of what you learned about their agenda but i want to play some of
[1:46:44.560 --> 1:46:47.520]  these audio clips before i do that before we get into the occult aspects
[1:46:47.520 --> 1:46:51.040]  more anything else you want to add george hunt
[1:46:51.040 --> 1:46:56.240]  uh not to the um uh spiritual part but just keep on going and maybe i can add
[1:46:56.240 --> 1:47:00.880]  some things to your talk okay you sent me 19 clips we can play any of these
[1:47:00.880 --> 1:47:04.080]  clips you want but i'm going to go ahead and play
[1:47:04.080 --> 1:47:08.560]  uh morris strong banking principles because it all sounds slick and
[1:47:08.560 --> 1:47:11.760]  sweet and loving but you can break down what he really means by that and now
[1:47:11.760 --> 1:47:14.960]  20 something years later we can see it's all been proven you were correct
[1:47:14.960 --> 1:47:18.320]  and what you got from this but here's morris strong that you recorded at one
[1:47:18.320 --> 1:47:22.880]  of the meetings here it is now all i'm saying really
[1:47:22.880 --> 1:47:29.120]  is that there are many areas in which it is possible
[1:47:29.120 --> 1:47:33.120]  to apply banking principles michael sweetman
[1:47:33.120 --> 1:47:37.120]  is a bank he's run major banking organizations
[1:47:37.120 --> 1:47:41.680]  and when he has proposed this idea he left to talk for himself but my
[1:47:41.680 --> 1:47:45.120]  understanding of it was that it was meant to tap
[1:47:45.120 --> 1:47:49.840]  new sources of funding to channel in to these
[1:47:49.840 --> 1:47:54.160]  areas in which uh an important conservation objective
[1:47:54.160 --> 1:47:58.160]  can be achieved in a manner compatible with a fair
[1:47:58.160 --> 1:48:03.760]  an economic return a bankable economic return
[1:48:03.760 --> 1:48:07.680]  okay now we see that today later in clips they talk about
[1:48:07.680 --> 1:48:11.680]  every corporation and company having to give money to this bank
[1:48:11.680 --> 1:48:17.680]  that will then save the environment uh comments on that george hunt
[1:48:17.680 --> 1:48:22.320]  would you repeat that question alex can we turn our audio up to you i was
[1:48:22.320 --> 1:48:26.720]  saying uh in these clips uh they're talking
[1:48:26.720 --> 1:48:32.160]  about banking principles and then comments on that
[1:48:32.160 --> 1:48:38.160]  uh i think if i if i played the first clip for you it would make it
[1:48:38.160 --> 1:48:41.600]  clearer to your audience okay let's play clip number one
[1:48:41.600 --> 1:48:46.240]  michael sweetman introduces the bank yeah there might be more in there for
[1:48:46.240 --> 1:48:50.160]  you okay okay now here's that clip i wonder people probably still coming in
[1:48:50.160 --> 1:48:55.360]  but i think we need to get on with the agenda
[1:48:55.360 --> 1:49:01.920]  i'm going to uh ask uh more strong to open the session with some remarks and
[1:49:01.920 --> 1:49:04.720]  then get asked him to introduce mr droth child
[1:49:04.720 --> 1:49:10.880]  on my left and uh following some remarks mr droth child um
[1:49:10.880 --> 1:49:14.320]  briefly set the scene and then i'm going to be going to open it to the floor and
[1:49:14.320 --> 1:49:17.440]  see if we can get some dialogue and get some response
[1:49:17.440 --> 1:49:21.040]  some questions and some ideas from you and we'll take it from there
[1:49:21.040 --> 1:49:25.040]  we want we've got three days we've got best topics we're dealing with
[1:49:25.040 --> 1:49:30.160]  as as the program uh indicates we've got some very good people on these panels
[1:49:30.160 --> 1:49:33.360]  and they've come a long way some of them to be here
[1:49:33.360 --> 1:49:37.520]  and i really appreciate that because um they're they're clearly
[1:49:37.520 --> 1:49:41.040]  show indicate an interest and i think we're going to have some
[1:49:41.040 --> 1:49:45.440]  really a very interesting time over the next three days
[1:49:45.440 --> 1:49:48.400]  but not just an interesting time i hope we're going to have a very productive
[1:49:48.400 --> 1:49:52.400]  time over the next three days and we're going to come out
[1:49:52.400 --> 1:49:55.840]  by tomorrow night at any rate with a resolution which we have to hand to the
[1:49:55.840 --> 1:49:58.960]  resolutionist committee if we want a resolution about the world
[1:49:58.960 --> 1:50:02.240]  conservation bank in the congress proceedings and i hope i trust that we
[1:50:02.240 --> 1:50:05.760]  do so we've got to think about that as well i
[1:50:05.760 --> 1:50:09.840]  suggest what we might do is to cover that at the end of these two sessions this
[1:50:09.840 --> 1:50:13.760]  afternoon and maybe some like somebody might not
[1:50:13.760 --> 1:50:18.400]  stay back and we could discuss how we um proceed with that
[1:50:18.400 --> 1:50:22.000]  uh yes george i could hear you we're finishing the clip you sent us
[1:50:22.000 --> 1:50:25.680]  we're going to break it was kind of long i'm sorry no it's fine that's good
[1:50:25.680 --> 1:50:29.120]  it's great uh we're gonna introduce the bank did you hear that
[1:50:29.120 --> 1:50:33.200]  we have to we have to present this tomorrow

[1:54:24.800 --> 1:54:28.080]  meetings by twist of fate and started investigating them going to some of
[1:54:28.080 --> 1:54:31.920]  the sub meetings over the years he is with us today
[1:54:31.920 --> 1:54:35.680]  and his website is thebigbank.com where you can get a documentary film he made
[1:54:35.680 --> 1:54:40.560]  along these same lines now got a bunch of clips here 19 clips
[1:54:40.560 --> 1:54:43.360]  and i want to play Rothschild sums up the conference i want to play some of the
[1:54:43.360 --> 1:54:47.040]  other clips Rothschild international communism introduced i want to go over
[1:54:47.040 --> 1:54:50.640]  these but first off is 17 you want to play 17
[1:54:50.640 --> 1:54:54.800]  david lang now tell people who david lang is george hunt
[1:54:54.800 --> 1:54:59.760]  yes he's a international banker from montreal canada
[1:54:59.760 --> 1:55:05.120]  is a close friend of michael sweepen the president of the world conservation bank
[1:55:05.120 --> 1:55:09.840]  okay let's go ahead about us yeah this is what he had to say about us here it is
[1:55:09.840 --> 1:55:12.800]  this looks like david lang from montreal
[1:55:12.800 --> 1:55:16.720]  he's always full of he's always full of awkward questions until recently on the
[1:55:16.720 --> 1:55:20.320]  balance sheet there were billions of dollars still listed as existing which
[1:55:20.320 --> 1:55:23.520]  have now been written off and so those services have a bad habit of
[1:55:23.520 --> 1:55:28.720]  disappearing when the auditor finally gets his hands into the balance sheet
[1:55:28.720 --> 1:55:33.040]  i suggest therefore that this be sold not through a democratic process
[1:55:33.040 --> 1:55:36.240]  that would take too long and devour far too much of the funds
[1:55:36.240 --> 1:55:39.520]  to educate the cannon fodder unfortunately
[1:55:39.520 --> 1:55:44.000]  which populates the earth we have to take almost an elitist program
[1:55:44.000 --> 1:55:47.600]  that we can see beyond our swollen bellies and look to the future
[1:55:47.600 --> 1:55:53.520]  in timeframes and in results which are not easily understood or which can be
[1:55:53.520 --> 1:55:57.360]  with intellectual honesty be reduced down to some kind of simplistic
[1:55:57.360 --> 1:56:03.600]  definition that's amazing statement george hunt
[1:56:03.600 --> 1:56:06.880]  yes it's amazing all right it turned my gut
[1:56:06.880 --> 1:56:11.280]  and uh... uh... that's why i'm talking to you today
[1:56:11.280 --> 1:56:15.200]  alex that just offended me so much we're the cannon fodder that are
[1:56:15.200 --> 1:56:19.120]  unfortunately on the earth and they're talking about millions of dollars they
[1:56:19.120 --> 1:56:21.280]  already had in their banking system and
[1:56:21.280 --> 1:56:25.200]  how and and talking about our property as if it was already theirs and how they
[1:56:25.200 --> 1:56:28.640]  were going to get it yes sir and they're
[1:56:28.640 --> 1:56:32.800]  they're uh... eliminating population uh...
[1:56:32.800 --> 1:56:37.600]  all the time through aids through uh...
[1:56:37.600 --> 1:56:43.360]  mercenary armies uh... through people like the black guard people uh... that
[1:56:43.360 --> 1:56:47.200]  were uh... we just found out that they were tied in with the cia
[1:56:47.200 --> 1:56:51.120]  they're going murdering iraqis it's uh...
[1:56:51.120 --> 1:56:54.320]  the american people have to do something about it or
[1:56:54.320 --> 1:56:59.440]  uh... and and we have to change our leadership we have to get cheney
[1:56:59.440 --> 1:57:03.680]  uh... we have to get cheney up to to the uh...
[1:57:03.680 --> 1:57:07.200]  to the bar to the justice bar and find out why
[1:57:07.200 --> 1:57:10.960]  hella burton hired these black guard
[1:57:10.960 --> 1:57:16.160]  uh... people that are killing citizens it's
[1:57:16.160 --> 1:57:20.560]  it's all over uh... it's all through our society
[1:57:20.560 --> 1:57:26.400]  we can't stop our government either they just keep on killing
[1:57:26.400 --> 1:57:29.920]  well we do have state department random 200 we're
[1:57:29.920 --> 1:57:35.360]  in 73 secretly to the cia a it was u.s government policy to use imf and world
[1:57:35.360 --> 1:57:40.240]  bank loans to force third world populations to reduce their population
[1:57:40.240 --> 1:57:45.840]  by at least 50 percent yes that kind of stuff that goes on
[1:57:45.840 --> 1:57:50.640]  it goes on all the time again amazing there are so many other clips here to

[2:00:26.720 --> 2:00:30.320]  i'm going to get into the latest on health care the flu scam has now been
[2:00:30.320 --> 2:00:35.360]  completely exposed by the e u itself as a total fraud and they admit these
[2:00:35.360 --> 2:00:39.920]  vaccines were dangerous and it was wrong uh we're also going to get into the
[2:00:39.920 --> 2:00:43.600]  latest on bankster gate with timmy geithner and all of his criminal
[2:00:43.600 --> 2:00:48.480]  activity and your phone calls but george hunt inside whistleblower
[2:00:48.480 --> 2:00:52.640]  who by a twist of fate wanted to get his son a job in conservation
[2:00:52.640 --> 2:00:57.760]  and literally one of the heads of the global government conference
[2:00:57.760 --> 2:01:00.640]  was sick he called him and he said probably didn't thought it was somebody
[2:01:00.640 --> 2:01:04.320]  else from the conference calling and said yeah you can go and just walked
[2:01:04.320 --> 2:01:07.760]  right into this and that's why it's important you go to government and
[2:01:07.760 --> 2:01:11.200]  non-governmental events weasel your way in record it
[2:01:11.200 --> 2:01:14.960]  you won't be i mean i went to a smart growth conference in 1998
[2:01:14.960 --> 2:01:19.840]  in austin they had 4 000 people there mainly from counties and cities
[2:01:19.840 --> 2:01:23.360]  paid by the cities to be there and they had the heads of the banks going we're
[2:01:23.360 --> 2:01:27.520]  taking everybody's property they weren't denying it it was a joke
[2:01:27.520 --> 2:01:31.600]  they were admitting they were criminals i mean they didn't even deny it
[2:01:31.600 --> 2:01:35.520]  okay and i was just whoa that's when i really woke up to the environmentalist
[2:01:35.520 --> 2:01:39.120]  i mean i was already thought i knew they were just misguided communists no no
[2:01:39.120 --> 2:01:44.000]  these are bankers okay so this next clip uh is roth child
[2:01:44.000 --> 2:01:47.120]  elaborates then we'll go through more of these clips and get george hunt's take
[2:01:47.120 --> 2:01:50.640]  on it okay uh roth child elaborates will play this
[2:01:50.640 --> 2:01:55.200]  to overcome the chilling doom laden prognostications
[2:01:55.200 --> 2:02:02.080]  of dr erving mincer's greenhouse effect perhaps it could be possible to utilize
[2:02:02.080 --> 2:02:08.640]  co2 carbon dioxide one of its main causes to manufacture dry ice
[2:02:08.640 --> 2:02:12.480]  to maintain the polar caps and the actual
[2:02:12.480 --> 2:02:17.440]  temperature of the ice there and maintain their present temperature
[2:02:17.440 --> 2:02:24.320]  innovative and modern technology world waste material collected and perhaps
[2:02:24.320 --> 2:02:29.520]  burnt in volcanic areas or buried so deep in the earth in the wilderness
[2:02:29.520 --> 2:02:33.200]  desert areas of the mid-sahara where nobody goes
[2:02:33.200 --> 2:02:37.840]  or in the empty quarter in arabia or the goby desert
[2:02:37.840 --> 2:02:44.800]  but all these ideas and visions some far-fetched and above all the
[2:02:44.800 --> 2:02:50.960]  continuation of this congress needs money
[2:02:50.960 --> 2:02:56.240]  so they get to take over and ship dry ice imagine the money they'd make or
[2:02:56.240 --> 2:03:00.080]  they will control globally toxic waste being shipped to the sahara
[2:03:00.080 --> 2:03:03.040]  so they want to control waste management they want to control private
[2:03:03.040 --> 2:03:07.200]  property uh and they want to scare the public with far-fetched
[2:03:07.200 --> 2:03:11.760]  programs into accepting that the earth must be dying from carbon dioxide
[2:03:11.760 --> 2:03:14.960]  because look at all the money we're spending on it it must be real
[2:03:14.960 --> 2:03:18.480]  is that an accurate breakdown of what he was really saying there
[2:03:18.480 --> 2:03:22.720]  george hunt yes they're creating a demand
[2:03:22.720 --> 2:03:28.160]  for dry ice machines shall we say through their rhetoric
[2:03:28.160 --> 2:03:33.760]  so that the people will become fearful of mother earth crumbling and they'll
[2:03:33.760 --> 2:03:37.920]  give in then to all of these monstrous projects
[2:03:37.920 --> 2:03:43.840]  that will cost trillions of dollars and and the elite will be in the front end
[2:03:43.840 --> 2:03:50.640]  of these projects and the uh maybe as the the first investors
[2:03:50.640 --> 2:03:56.080]  and it will grow into a huge monster and then it'll collapse
[2:03:56.080 --> 2:04:00.160]  and uh the elite will have pulled themselves out of the
[2:04:00.160 --> 2:04:04.320]  uh of this uh project before it collapses
[2:04:04.320 --> 2:04:10.880]  so um you're going to see a lot of these uh ideas coming along that will
[2:04:10.880 --> 2:04:17.040]  change the climate harp is one one example that was another point and
[2:04:17.040 --> 2:04:20.240]  we're going to go to break long segment coming up and play clip after clip
[2:04:20.240 --> 2:04:23.920]  but clearly it's now declassified they have weather weapons they can create
[2:04:23.920 --> 2:04:27.520]  control hurricanes that's all declassified we know
[2:04:27.520 --> 2:04:30.960]  the white house science are john p. Holder who's called for global
[2:04:30.960 --> 2:04:34.800]  extermination drugging the water to sterilizes in his own book
[2:04:34.800 --> 2:04:39.520]  eco science we know that they're already manipulating the weather
[2:04:39.520 --> 2:04:42.560]  to create calamities to scare people into submission
[2:04:42.560 --> 2:04:46.480]  george hunt stay there i'm going to come back and get your take on that
[2:04:46.480 --> 2:04:49.680]  on the other side of this quick break and then we're going to play clip after
[2:04:49.680 --> 2:04:54.320]  clip and get quick comments from you about what roth child strong
[2:04:54.320 --> 2:04:58.320]  and others are saying they talk about international communism being
[2:04:58.320 --> 2:05:03.040]  introduced this is incredible info this is alex jones with five good reasons
[2:05:03.040 --> 2:05:05.520]  you should consider buying a solar power generator
[2:05:05.520 --> 2:05:09.040]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your
[2:05:09.040 --> 2:05:12.240]  electric bill number two our new energies are wants to
[2:05:12.240 --> 2:05:15.520]  control how much power your electric company allows you to have
[2:05:15.520 --> 2:05:19.520]  it's true total government control of electricity in the name of smart
[2:05:19.520 --> 2:05:22.960]  grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[2:05:22.960 --> 2:05:25.600]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[2:05:25.600 --> 2:05:29.520]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem
[2:05:29.520 --> 2:05:33.120]  number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[2:05:33.120 --> 2:05:36.160]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related
[2:05:36.160 --> 2:05:39.280]  onages number five a solar power generator provides
[2:05:39.280 --> 2:05:42.720]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks i really believe in the
[2:05:42.720 --> 2:05:45.760]  solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my
[2:05:45.760 --> 2:05:50.960]  old sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com

[2:08:26.400 --> 2:08:32.160]  about how they be classified weather manipulation weather control systems
[2:08:32.160 --> 2:08:36.080]  and how they can clearly use this to create calamities and then scare the
[2:08:36.080 --> 2:08:40.640]  population into submission that's been one of my biggest concerns
[2:08:40.640 --> 2:08:44.000]  going back to george hunt george your take on that
[2:08:44.000 --> 2:08:55.440]  well um the um the concern that i have is the e-bomb the so-called
[2:08:55.440 --> 2:09:01.280]  um surge bomb electromagnetic pulse weapon
[2:09:01.280 --> 2:09:05.360]  yes you got it that thing would be easy for any
[2:09:05.360 --> 2:09:09.440]  little state like north korea or iran or israel
[2:09:09.440 --> 2:09:15.600]  to send a rocket bearing an atomic bomb up in the sky about 300 miles
[2:09:15.600 --> 2:09:19.360]  exploding it and wiping out all of the electricity
[2:09:19.360 --> 2:09:23.440]  in the in line of sight of that explosion that's the thing to bother you
[2:09:23.440 --> 2:09:27.200]  think the globalist would go that far oh yes
[2:09:27.200 --> 2:09:30.960]  david rockfeller has stated and i checked it on the
[2:09:30.960 --> 2:09:36.000]  on the internet last night that the world order will not be established
[2:09:36.000 --> 2:09:41.440]  until a terrible catastrophe occurs yeah they all say that continually
[2:09:41.440 --> 2:09:44.800]  actually said that in the council on farm relations publication
[2:09:44.800 --> 2:09:49.040]  foreign affairs that's part of their fear doctrine
[2:09:49.040 --> 2:09:52.800]  maybe do you want to continue along that line or go to some more clips

[2:10:18.000 --> 2:10:21.200]  that positive synthesis between environment
[2:10:21.200 --> 2:10:25.840]  conservation on the one hand and economics on the other
[2:10:25.840 --> 2:10:29.040]  and i'm just delighted to have this opportunity of
[2:10:29.040 --> 2:10:35.360]  introducing to you edmund the roth child now i want to go ahead now and go to

[2:10:44.560 --> 2:10:49.280]  by thinking forward as to how to reach out to the public at large
[2:10:49.280 --> 2:10:52.800]  to every corporate entity throughout the world
[2:10:52.800 --> 2:11:01.040]  to put aside hopefully tax-free a part of their profits to fund our ecological
[2:11:01.040 --> 2:11:07.200]  and environmental protection so tax-free paid to his bank i have
[2:11:07.200 --> 2:11:10.480]  Reuters right here 20-something years later here it is
[2:11:10.480 --> 2:11:13.600]  happening giving them money and then they're
[2:11:13.600 --> 2:11:18.240]  tax-free to use it that's it i didn't know that occurred but
[2:11:18.240 --> 2:11:23.520]  i saw the banks tumbling down and as the banks tumble they're tumbling to the
[2:11:23.520 --> 2:11:28.880]  house of roth child now on the last clip you played uh
[2:11:28.880 --> 2:11:32.160]  or the one before that did you hear morris strong
[2:11:32.160 --> 2:11:36.720]  announce him as the positive synthesis between
[2:11:36.720 --> 2:11:42.000]  conservation on one side and growth and development on the other
[2:11:42.000 --> 2:11:48.560]  he is the result of he controls in other words the conservation movement
[2:11:48.560 --> 2:11:52.240]  and the economic movement roth child's got it all
[2:11:52.240 --> 2:11:55.200]  well i've seen all the big roth child's out of england
[2:11:55.200 --> 2:12:00.560]  uh the the two heads of it openly writing articles giving speeches calling
[2:12:00.560 --> 2:12:03.040]  for global governance we'll play a clip from bloomberg
[2:12:03.040 --> 2:12:08.320]  here in Copenhagen coming up uh let's go ahead now and go to clip number 14
[2:12:08.320 --> 2:12:12.480]  roth child lord roth child international communism introduced
[2:12:12.480 --> 2:12:16.720]  here's that clip okay ladies and gentlemen every country
[2:12:16.720 --> 2:12:21.040]  has its own problems its indigenous peoples
[2:12:21.040 --> 2:12:26.080]  and its wildlife this international conservation bank
[2:12:26.080 --> 2:12:33.760]  must know no frontiers no boundaries its funds must be used constructively
[2:12:33.760 --> 2:12:38.720]  and not and not to be challenged into greedy hands
[2:12:38.720 --> 2:12:44.160]  or weapons of destruction so here are these people always financing
[2:12:44.160 --> 2:12:48.880]  revolutions and wars and weapons systems uh and and and you call that
[2:12:48.880 --> 2:12:51.600]  communism introduced what do you say that
[2:12:51.600 --> 2:12:57.360]  yes uh uh in other words the currency will be used as a as a communal
[2:12:57.360 --> 2:13:03.040]  uh device because there will be one world currency
[2:13:03.040 --> 2:13:07.040]  and he's saying to write his every call in speech
[2:13:07.040 --> 2:13:14.480]  that that uh each each country also has its own indigenous people
[2:13:14.480 --> 2:13:19.840]  and they'll they'll be allowed to have soft currencies but the currencies will
[2:13:19.840 --> 2:13:23.280]  be intermingled and uh and yeah you're gonna have a
[2:13:23.280 --> 2:13:27.520]  global currency over the regionals which they're now setting up it's amazing
[2:13:27.520 --> 2:13:32.080]  23 years later to see all of this actually unfolding
[2:13:32.080 --> 2:13:35.280]  and uh also ban kai moon a month and a half ago in the new
[2:13:35.280 --> 2:13:39.600]  ark times secretary general the un he said all nations will be forced
[2:13:39.600 --> 2:13:46.320]  to pay into the un uh to fund this uh let's play let's play clip number 15
[2:13:46.320 --> 2:13:50.080]  roth child brags here it is
[2:13:52.400 --> 2:13:57.040]  if there are any Japanese in the audience i would apologize to them
[2:13:57.040 --> 2:14:00.160]  but i've had very great experience in japan
[2:14:00.160 --> 2:14:04.800]  since my family has had connections with them since 1865 after peri opened them
[2:14:04.800 --> 2:14:11.520]  up in 1863
[2:14:11.520 --> 2:14:16.960]  let's play another clip uh let's uh have michael sweetman james baker quote
[2:14:16.960 --> 2:14:21.120]  clip number 16 here's michael sweetman james baker quote
[2:14:21.120 --> 2:14:24.960]  here it is at his keynote address to this congress u.s treasury secretary
[2:14:24.960 --> 2:14:28.960]  james a baker pointed to the i quote the underlying
[2:14:28.960 --> 2:14:32.880]  reality that sound conservation is good economics
[2:14:32.880 --> 2:14:37.040]  and further conservation should not be the enemy of prosperity
[2:14:37.040 --> 2:14:40.880]  it should instead sustain and enrich our prosperity
[2:14:40.880 --> 2:14:48.000]  i'm quick how do you decipher that decode that uh george hunt
[2:14:48.000 --> 2:14:52.320]  oh i i couldn't hear him very well on that uh
[2:14:52.320 --> 2:14:58.320]  i uh i have to uh beg yeah that's i think that's part of the problem
[2:14:58.320 --> 2:15:01.920]  today if you're having trouble hearing that was the james baker quote by uh
[2:15:01.920 --> 2:15:06.320]  michael sweetman oh yes i played i set that up for you
[2:15:06.320 --> 2:15:12.880]  to play because james baker made a a remark that caused the conservationist
[2:15:12.880 --> 2:15:17.520]  to tremble at the beginning of the meeting he gave the keynote address
[2:15:17.520 --> 2:15:22.480]  and he said that conservation required growth and development
[2:15:22.480 --> 2:15:26.800]  and the conservationist said what you could hear the murmur in the audience
[2:15:26.800 --> 2:15:30.560]  well what that means is that ross child in order to
[2:15:30.560 --> 2:15:36.400]  be the positive synthesis of growth and development and economics
[2:15:36.400 --> 2:15:41.520]  has to have a dynamic going it has to be a forceful
[2:15:41.520 --> 2:15:48.480]  opposition in order for his his group to go in and pick up the pieces that take
[2:15:48.480 --> 2:15:52.800]  over control so he's encouraging this war between
[2:15:52.800 --> 2:15:58.800]  conservation and development and he is the synthesis of all the stuff
[2:15:58.800 --> 2:16:02.640]  that will come out of the war now for those that missed it i want to play
[2:16:02.640 --> 2:16:07.520]  banker david lang talking about their elitist program and how to deal with
[2:16:07.520 --> 2:16:10.480]  the cannon fodder one more time and then two final clips
[2:16:10.480 --> 2:16:14.400]  we haven't played yet play clip 17 it's so chilling
[2:16:14.400 --> 2:16:19.600]  here is clip 17 david lang from montreal he's always full of he's always full
[2:16:19.600 --> 2:16:23.200]  of awkward questions until recently on the balance sheet there were
[2:16:23.200 --> 2:16:26.560]  billions of dollars still listed as existing which have now been written
[2:16:26.560 --> 2:16:30.160]  off and so those surfaces have a bad habit of disappearing
[2:16:30.160 --> 2:16:34.240]  when the auditor finally gets his hands into the balance sheet
[2:16:34.240 --> 2:16:38.560]  i suggest therefore that this be sold not through a democratic process
[2:16:38.560 --> 2:16:41.760]  that would take too long and devour far too much of the funds
[2:16:41.760 --> 2:16:46.000]  to educate the cannon fodder unfortunately which populates the
[2:16:46.000 --> 2:16:49.520]  earth we have to take almost an elitist program
[2:16:49.520 --> 2:16:53.120]  that we can see beyond our swollen bellies and look to the future
[2:16:53.120 --> 2:16:58.960]  in timeframes and in results which are not easily understood or which can be
[2:16:58.960 --> 2:17:02.880]  with intellectual honesty be reduced down to some kind of simplistic
[2:17:02.880 --> 2:17:08.400]  definition okay george hunt george i want to ask you
[2:17:08.400 --> 2:17:12.080]  about this maharaja clip where he questions michael
[2:17:12.080 --> 2:17:15.840]  sweetman's words we're going to play this clip and then get you to comment on
[2:17:15.840 --> 2:17:20.160]  that okay all right good here is the maharaja
[2:17:20.160 --> 2:17:23.520]  questions michael sweetman's words here it is
[2:17:23.520 --> 2:17:28.480]  i'd be very brief i've been listening patiently
[2:17:28.480 --> 2:17:34.720]  michael sweetman's paper and discussion so far
[2:17:35.600 --> 2:17:42.320]  i'm confused particularly since i'm the president of the world wildlife fund
[2:17:42.320 --> 2:17:52.400]  india an NGO of the need of another helping hand
[2:17:52.400 --> 2:18:00.320]  but since this baby has been accidentally conceived by michael
[2:18:00.320 --> 2:18:08.400]  sweetman and i presume that he's either
[2:18:08.400 --> 2:18:14.720]  a very foolish man or a very clever man i think he's a very clever man
[2:18:14.720 --> 2:18:20.400]  because the paper does not give any details it's very general
[2:18:20.400 --> 2:18:25.520]  wow so maharaja is pointing out this gives a blank check of power
[2:18:25.520 --> 2:18:31.440]  to this world conference congress instead of the world wildlife fund set up
[2:18:31.440 --> 2:18:34.960]  by the nazi prince Bernhard to carry out extermination what's
[2:18:34.960 --> 2:18:41.280]  what's going on in that clip with the maharaja well the maharaja
[2:18:41.280 --> 2:18:48.160]  saw the light he saw that either it was a very foolish plan
[2:18:48.160 --> 2:18:51.600]  that michael sweetman was introducing you know save
[2:18:51.600 --> 2:18:56.960]  save the world's conservation or it was a clever plan
[2:18:56.960 --> 2:19:01.920]  and he didn't identify why it was clever but he said but i believe it's a
[2:19:01.920 --> 2:19:06.240]  clever plan uh it's a clever plan because
[2:19:06.240 --> 2:19:11.200]  it uh it uh seems to appear that they are saving
[2:19:11.200 --> 2:19:15.600]  conservation and i think that's what the maharaja

[2:24:33.840 --> 2:24:38.720]  bombshell studying the unzone document studying the imf world bank
[2:24:38.720 --> 2:24:41.600]  the banks want to get everybody in debt all the nations all the
[2:24:41.600 --> 2:24:46.560]  substates within the nations bankrupted to then make you dependent on them
[2:24:46.560 --> 2:24:50.240]  and then under environmental rules grab and snatch property
[2:24:50.240 --> 2:24:53.600]  and and and raise the taxes so you go bankrupt
[2:24:53.600 --> 2:24:58.640]  then they bring in a global regime global rationing openly being announced
[2:24:58.640 --> 2:25:02.000]  this is their plan their brainwashing your kids in school
[2:25:02.000 --> 2:25:05.840]  they're really trying it copenhagen was a big blow against them
[2:25:05.840 --> 2:25:10.160]  the fact that the that their scientists know it's a fraud ben santa at the un
[2:25:10.160 --> 2:25:14.080]  admitting that it's all uh you know made up that they basically cut these
[2:25:14.080 --> 2:25:18.240]  sections out of the un report uh where their own scientists said man wasn't
[2:25:18.240 --> 2:25:21.840]  causing global warming or they're covering up the fact for the last nine
[2:25:21.840 --> 2:25:25.920]  years the earth has been radically cooling all of this
[2:25:25.920 --> 2:25:29.920]  uh and then he's saying he's there talking to
[2:25:29.920 --> 2:25:34.320]  rockefeller talking to others specifically tell that story
[2:25:34.320 --> 2:25:39.120]  and they're saying they're gonna bankrupt the world in 2012 this is in 1987
[2:25:39.120 --> 2:25:42.480]  everything george talked about he put this out 15 years ago or more
[2:25:42.480 --> 2:25:46.000]  has now come true really proving what he's saying
[2:25:46.000 --> 2:25:50.480]  uh but uh specifically take your time who said this again was it rockefeller
[2:25:50.480 --> 2:25:53.680]  i'm going from memory at this conference they said
[2:25:53.680 --> 2:25:57.760]  how they're going to do it and make the world conservation bank take over
[2:25:57.760 --> 2:26:04.640]  okay it was the you remember i was there for three days
[2:26:04.640 --> 2:26:11.920]  asking lots of questions okay so the the questions evolved to
[2:26:11.920 --> 2:26:18.240]  number one question i had was how is this bank going to be funded
[2:26:18.240 --> 2:26:22.640]  i learned through the the guests there
[2:26:22.640 --> 2:26:26.640]  maybe i went to mcneil of the united nations i don't know where
[2:26:26.640 --> 2:26:32.640]  but i found out that the plan is and this is hearsay
[2:26:32.640 --> 2:26:39.600]  that the plan is that the that the bank is going to bankrupt in 2012
[2:26:39.600 --> 2:26:48.480]  and that the the uh uh the the elite that put money into the bank
[2:26:48.480 --> 2:26:52.560]  when it bankrupts those elite people will go into the bank
[2:26:52.560 --> 2:26:56.720]  take it over and take over every mortgage everything
[2:26:56.720 --> 2:26:59.840]  all the accounts all the credit cards everything
[2:26:59.840 --> 2:27:04.160]  that people have and the bank will then officially be
[2:27:04.160 --> 2:27:08.560]  in ross child's hand where before it was
[2:27:08.560 --> 2:27:13.360]  surreptitiously in ross child's hand well this is incredible let me stop you
[2:27:13.360 --> 2:27:16.400]  and i want you to elaborate george hunt because now
[2:27:16.400 --> 2:27:20.160]  we see a small group of central banks bankrupting other banks
[2:27:20.160 --> 2:27:23.760]  by design to consolidate that's in their own documents we see the imf and world
[2:27:23.760 --> 2:27:27.600]  bank to be holding companies for the global tax money
[2:27:27.600 --> 2:27:31.840]  through what they did agree to at copenhagen uh and that's actually what
[2:27:31.840 --> 2:27:35.280]  they're now setting up they're openly setting up
[2:27:35.280 --> 2:27:39.360]  what participants told you they were going to set up are they getting this
[2:27:39.360 --> 2:27:44.880]  position for 2012 that's where they're headed from my last information
[2:27:44.880 --> 2:27:49.440]  alex um they don't slow down on their plans
[2:27:49.440 --> 2:27:53.920]  they don't defer them they just eliminate the problem
[2:27:53.920 --> 2:27:58.480]  for their plans to go through people like me of course
[2:27:58.480 --> 2:28:02.000]  um so yeah i i would say there's going to be
[2:28:02.000 --> 2:28:09.120]  a major uh currency uh splash in 2012
[2:28:09.120 --> 2:28:15.120]  or leading up to 2000 or or leading up to 2012 i mean this is already happening
[2:28:15.120 --> 2:28:18.560]  yeah the globe is imploding by an engineered depression
[2:28:18.560 --> 2:28:21.760]  and everything is falling to the house of Rothschild and Rockefeller
[2:28:21.760 --> 2:28:25.360]  and every time they bust in oligarch in russia it turns out it was really owned
[2:28:25.360 --> 2:28:28.720]  by the Rothschilds that's mainstream news well yeah
[2:28:28.720 --> 2:28:34.000]  look at the news about Warren Buffett he he's accusing the Rothschild family of
[2:28:34.000 --> 2:28:39.200]  controlling the world gold market he's probably right because the Rothschilds
[2:28:39.200 --> 2:28:45.280]  set the price of gold twice a day in london for the world
[2:28:45.280 --> 2:28:50.320]  unbelievable information and again when did you first start going public
[2:28:50.320 --> 2:28:53.440]  releasing the videos of the conferences releasing the audio
[2:28:53.440 --> 2:28:57.280]  and saying all of this wasn't it like 20 years ago
[2:28:57.280 --> 2:29:01.840]  yes it was the 1988 that uh i uh preacher named
[2:29:01.840 --> 2:29:08.320]  charl oh allendale who had a radio station in in texas
[2:29:08.320 --> 2:29:16.080]  was uh was accused of uh of having a uh having me on
[2:29:16.080 --> 2:29:20.160]  and they said look if you have that guy george herron again
[2:29:20.160 --> 2:29:24.000]  you're gonna lose your job well he had me on again the next week because this
[2:29:24.000 --> 2:29:28.480]  deserves shattering news well the station was immediately bought out
[2:29:28.480 --> 2:29:32.720]  and allen allen dale lost his job and that's the that's the issue
[2:29:32.720 --> 2:29:36.800]  20 years ago 22 years ago they could they could stop stuff
[2:29:36.800 --> 2:29:40.240]  now they can't it's out in the open stay there george hunt

[2:33:29.760 --> 2:33:33.520]  right now the flu fraud being fully exposed but i
[2:33:33.520 --> 2:33:36.320]  want to go to calls mike herman terry ben
[2:33:36.320 --> 2:33:40.720]  we're only taking calls specifically for george hunt for your questions
[2:33:40.720 --> 2:33:44.480]  on this important issue of a global elite organizing the planet under the
[2:33:44.480 --> 2:33:48.080]  fraud of fake environmentalism to take your basic rights or liberty your
[2:33:48.080 --> 2:33:51.360]  property and we played that clip yesterday of australia where
[2:33:51.360 --> 2:33:55.360]  they're just grabbing all the farmers land literally in some areas all of it
[2:33:55.360 --> 2:33:58.160]  and just saying it's off limits for carbon credits
[2:33:58.160 --> 2:34:02.000]  you can't run cattle or sheep on your own land anymore
[2:34:02.000 --> 2:34:06.160]  this is really happening and it's happening here and we've got to stop
[2:34:06.160 --> 2:34:09.520]  these people when we got the spp documents a few years
[2:34:09.520 --> 2:34:12.560]  ago from the north american union meetings it was the corporate leaders
[2:34:12.560 --> 2:34:16.000]  there running the government meetings with the bureaucracy saying
[2:34:16.000 --> 2:34:19.200]  we're gonna tax and pay ourselves the carbon tax
[2:34:19.200 --> 2:34:24.320]  the good news is this is in trouble george hunt are you not excited to see
[2:34:24.320 --> 2:34:28.720]  kopenhagen exposed and you were talking about this 22 years ago and people
[2:34:28.720 --> 2:34:32.000]  some of them are laughing at you now it's all out in the open
[2:34:32.000 --> 2:34:36.480]  is that exciting you george hunt oh it's exciting me so much
[2:34:36.480 --> 2:34:40.640]  my name is george washington hunt i was born on columbus day
[2:34:40.640 --> 2:34:44.400]  and i think that i have a mission to
[2:34:44.400 --> 2:34:49.040]  uh to defeat these people to to help defeat these people
[2:34:49.040 --> 2:34:53.600]  i had uh when i was on the uh jesse ventura show i
[2:34:53.600 --> 2:34:57.840]  i i said to the camera i think they're gonna win it
[2:34:57.840 --> 2:35:02.640]  and the reason was that they're smarter than us but if you take our combined
[2:35:02.640 --> 2:35:05.520]  intelligence like i'm hearing coming out of you
[2:35:05.520 --> 2:35:09.280]  and you're hearing come out on me we can with these guys so we can get the
[2:35:09.280 --> 2:35:14.160]  americans to to cooperate americans and others around the
[2:35:14.160 --> 2:35:17.600]  world just have to face their own documents their own statements
[2:35:17.600 --> 2:35:22.080]  i mean in fact i'll grab it it's over here
[2:35:22.080 --> 2:35:26.320]  i talk about this book every week on air eco science i've scanned through the
[2:35:26.320 --> 2:35:30.000]  whole 1100 pages or whatever it is let me see how
[2:35:30.000 --> 2:35:34.880]  long it is yeah the 1100 pages i've scanned through this and openly
[2:35:34.880 --> 2:35:38.800]  says poison the water supply sterilizes cut off our resources
[2:35:38.800 --> 2:35:42.480]  bankrupt us this is the white house science are john p holdren
[2:35:42.480 --> 2:35:46.160]  wrote eco science i mean there are literally thousands of white papers
[2:35:46.160 --> 2:35:50.240]  books publications where they openly state what they're openly doing
[2:35:50.240 --> 2:35:54.080]  and now this guy gives press conferences the white house science are
[2:35:54.080 --> 2:35:58.640]  saying they've got a secret program already manipulating the weather
[2:35:58.640 --> 2:36:02.800]  that's right they ballerina they they dreamed up these plans
[2:36:02.800 --> 2:36:09.200]  uh as far as hundreds of years ago and the uh the contemporary plans that we
[2:36:09.200 --> 2:36:12.400]  see where the banks are going down and so on
[2:36:12.400 --> 2:36:16.560]  is that uh is part of their plan that was conceived
[2:36:16.560 --> 2:36:20.320]  um as far as i could see a hundred years ago
[2:36:20.320 --> 2:36:24.080]  okay i want to go to calls but first i want to play a few global governance
[2:36:24.080 --> 2:36:27.760]  clips for people that may have missed the last few of them uh that
[2:36:27.760 --> 2:36:31.440]  have occurred in the last two months herman von rumpi the head of the eu
[2:36:31.440 --> 2:36:35.520]  openly calling for global governance saying that the un
[2:36:35.520 --> 2:36:38.640]  global carbon tax is the heart of world government
[2:36:38.640 --> 2:36:42.720]  the head of the eu we have gordon brown calling for global governance we have
[2:36:42.720 --> 2:36:47.040]  uh david iraq child the heir to this whole criminal fortune
[2:36:47.040 --> 2:36:51.040]  uh calling for it here is david iraq child from kopenhagen
[2:36:51.040 --> 2:36:54.240]  on bloomberg tv it's it's past the point of talking
[2:36:54.240 --> 2:36:58.560]  um we know historically that the global governance um the sort of agenda
[2:36:58.560 --> 2:37:02.320]  um to these issues is is very hard to try and is with all the best intentions
[2:37:02.320 --> 2:37:05.680]  it's very hard to actually activate we're seeing that right now we're seeing
[2:37:05.680 --> 2:37:09.280]  a lot of fragmentation going on in kopenhagen a lot of different agendas
[2:37:09.280 --> 2:37:12.320]  pulling in different directions and i think what we're what we really need to
[2:37:12.320 --> 2:37:16.160]  see is people on the ground starting to actually act upon the low hanging fruit
[2:37:16.160 --> 2:37:20.320]  and start to try and move on the solutions that we have a hand
[2:37:20.320 --> 2:37:24.720]  in case you missed it global it's past the point of talking
[2:37:24.720 --> 2:37:28.960]  um we know historically that the global governance um the sort of agenda
[2:37:28.960 --> 2:37:33.040]  um to these issues is is very hard to try and is is with all the best so there
[2:37:33.040 --> 2:37:37.760]  he is saying the time for talk is over that means you don't get any input
[2:37:37.760 --> 2:37:41.680]  we're doing this well we did get input we did expose their fraud
[2:37:41.680 --> 2:37:46.080]  they're in trouble george hunt for this whole global uh
[2:37:46.080 --> 2:37:51.040]  a carbon tax uh thing that's going on i have to admit that i don't really
[2:37:51.040 --> 2:37:55.200]  understand it but i do know that the house of ross trial
[2:37:55.200 --> 2:38:00.240]  uh pushed it through their uh through the chairman of the house of ross trial
[2:38:00.240 --> 2:38:06.240]  uh at a uh meeting of the london banks that would that happened about six
[2:38:06.240 --> 2:38:09.200]  months ago when i picked up on that clip
[2:38:09.200 --> 2:38:14.160]  they this carbon tax so what do you know about it alex
[2:38:14.160 --> 2:38:18.320]  well it's fully meant to tax and control all human activity to be selectively
[2:38:18.320 --> 2:38:21.520]  enforced uh just like the health care plan
[2:38:21.520 --> 2:38:25.120]  some unions don't have to do it but the rest of the public do
[2:38:25.120 --> 2:38:27.920]  it's all selectively enforced like obama decided
[2:38:27.920 --> 2:38:31.920]  what car dealership stayed open what didn't three billion dollars the 25
[2:38:31.920 --> 2:38:36.400]  billion for the auto bailout paid to move factories on record this is
[2:38:36.400 --> 2:38:40.640]  associated press to brazil eastern europe russia and china
[2:38:40.640 --> 2:38:46.160]  so the globalists literally pay to have factories built for themselves
[2:38:46.160 --> 2:38:51.440]  as morris strong said on tv in 1992 in rio de Janeiro as the head of the union
[2:38:51.440 --> 2:38:54.880]  summit it is our job to it to destroy industrial
[2:38:54.880 --> 2:38:59.120]  society in the west uh let's play this clip of herman von
[2:38:59.120 --> 2:39:02.720]  rupee uh in his acceptance speech as the new head of the
[2:39:02.720 --> 2:39:07.520]  EU calling for global governance 2009 is also the first year
[2:39:07.520 --> 2:39:10.640]  of global governance with the establishment of the g20 in the
[2:39:10.640 --> 2:39:13.920]  middle of the financial crisis the climate
[2:39:13.920 --> 2:39:18.640]  conference in copenhagen is another step towards the global
[2:39:18.640 --> 2:39:24.800]  management of our planet our mission our presidency is one
[2:39:24.800 --> 2:39:31.040]  of hope supported by acts and by deeds
[2:39:31.040 --> 2:39:36.400]  okay again there's herman von rupee we have bancai moon gordon brown why are
[2:39:36.400 --> 2:39:39.840]  they coming out in the open now because we're approaching
[2:39:39.840 --> 2:39:44.240]  uh the 2011 12 which all the economists here say they believe
[2:39:44.240 --> 2:39:47.520]  is the time that everything's going to collapse are they are they getting us
[2:39:47.520 --> 2:39:52.000]  ready for global government oh oh yes they're getting us ready for global
[2:39:52.000 --> 2:39:55.200]  government even in the school's intermediate
[2:39:55.200 --> 2:40:02.560]  schools colleges people are all whistling uh global government
[2:40:02.560 --> 2:40:07.440]  it's it it has infected our society already
[2:40:07.440 --> 2:40:12.320]  they'll uh they'll attract the people through the religious
[2:40:12.320 --> 2:40:19.040]  aspects of the government through the promise of of being able to buy or
[2:40:19.040 --> 2:40:22.800]  sell if you cooperated with the global global government
[2:40:22.800 --> 2:40:26.400]  if you don't cooperate you won't be able to buy yourself
[2:40:26.400 --> 2:40:30.720]  that that's been prophesied in the bible and i think that we're headed
[2:40:30.720 --> 2:40:35.120]  for that very soon when we have only one bank
[2:40:35.120 --> 2:40:38.400]  and they're openly saying that's their program this global
[2:40:38.400 --> 2:40:42.080]  private banking government will decide if you can have a business if you can
[2:40:42.080 --> 2:40:45.280]  have a factory if you can have a job if you can have your farm
[2:40:45.280 --> 2:40:50.080]  you own i mean this is really happening with the animal ID the premise
[2:40:50.080 --> 2:40:53.120]  society all of it that's why so what yes sir
[2:40:53.120 --> 2:40:57.600]  in the Copenhagen 50 of the echo 15 whatever it was it was called it the
[2:40:57.600 --> 2:41:03.840]  Copenhagen uh if if we had if if we had gone
[2:41:03.840 --> 2:41:08.560]  to the line and signed that document we would have been giving away our rights
[2:41:08.560 --> 2:41:12.480]  to how much hot water we can use per day
[2:41:12.480 --> 2:41:16.080]  what kind of car will drive we would have uh
[2:41:16.080 --> 2:41:20.320]  made ourselves in the as the same common person
[2:41:20.320 --> 2:41:23.520]  in the world and here we are a blessed country
[2:41:23.520 --> 2:41:26.800]  and we give it all up through Copenhagen 15
[2:41:26.800 --> 2:41:30.800]  it's not enough for these bankers to rob and loot and run their scams they want
[2:41:30.800 --> 2:41:34.320]  to shut off our resources to make us completely dependent on them we're
[2:41:34.320 --> 2:41:37.600]  going to calls now i want to encourage everybody to go to

[2:41:58.960 --> 2:42:01.920]  they're using the environmental movement the police state they're setting up to
[2:42:01.920 --> 2:42:05.040]  enforce it in-game blueprint for global enslavement
[2:42:05.040 --> 2:42:09.360]  covers the depopulation their entire program everyone must see this this is
[2:42:09.360 --> 2:42:12.560]  real they're doing it you ask what is the solution
[2:42:12.560 --> 2:42:16.960]  education show the people that environmentalism has nothing to do with
[2:42:16.960 --> 2:42:20.000]  the environment they co-opt all these good people to serve
[2:42:20.000 --> 2:42:23.120]  them this is their takeover and it's in trouble
[2:42:23.120 --> 2:42:27.040]  but they've invested hundreds of billions conservatively in this propaganda
[2:42:27.040 --> 2:42:30.720]  they're moving forward with it but they're beginning to slow
[2:42:30.720 --> 2:42:33.520]  if you take action and educate everyone you know
[2:42:33.520 --> 2:42:37.680]  we can stop these people so get the films at info wars

[2:42:46.000 --> 2:42:50.240]  george hunt yeah a question for the guest um
[2:42:50.240 --> 2:42:54.080]  it when you admit with the elite had they had mentioned anything
[2:42:54.080 --> 2:42:57.920]  about um this is in the late 80s from my understanding from what you're saying
[2:42:57.920 --> 2:43:01.680]  anything about government sponsored care in particularly 9-11
[2:43:01.680 --> 2:43:06.720]  being carried out in the future staging crises staging terror attacks
[2:43:06.720 --> 2:43:14.160]  no there was nothing mentioned of a of a war or warfare
[2:43:14.160 --> 2:43:18.720]  or anti-terrorist nothing like that came up
[2:43:18.720 --> 2:43:22.400]  okay they talked about using the threat of environmental catastrophe
[2:43:22.400 --> 2:43:25.840]  which is another form of false words it was it was a
[2:43:25.840 --> 2:43:29.840]  yeah i i missed that you know they he
[2:43:29.840 --> 2:43:33.360]  ross charles said that we were doomed to
[2:43:33.360 --> 2:43:37.840]  to extinction if we didn't accept its bank in this program
[2:43:37.840 --> 2:43:41.440]  he will save us and now his son we're told in the newspaper
[2:43:41.440 --> 2:43:44.560]  is a jesus archetype literally i mean you can't
[2:43:44.560 --> 2:43:48.960]  you can't make this type of bizarreness up ladies and gentlemen
[2:43:48.960 --> 2:43:52.160]  uh the hero gene inside talks about him being a jesus figure
[2:43:52.160 --> 2:43:56.800]  anything else mike um gaelic you think then then that the

[2:45:58.960 --> 2:46:02.720]  your articles on my facebook page facebook dot com slash
[2:46:02.720 --> 2:46:08.320]  one zero zero b i l l i o n and uh my question for
[2:46:08.320 --> 2:46:12.400]  mr hunt is what's the most important part of the eugenics movement that should
[2:46:12.400 --> 2:46:15.920]  be highlighted and exposed because when i just say eugenics
[2:46:15.920 --> 2:46:20.560]  and i just uh speak of the issue it's a bit much for the average person to
[2:46:20.560 --> 2:46:24.880]  well they better learn herman's herman's asking again what is the most important
[2:46:24.880 --> 2:46:29.360]  part of their d the depopulation agenda
[2:46:29.360 --> 2:46:33.760]  well the most important part is to eliminate
[2:46:33.760 --> 2:46:40.400]  uh the people who are destroying the environment
[2:46:40.400 --> 2:46:44.720]  uh if you look at pictures from the bruteland report
[2:46:44.720 --> 2:46:48.480]  uh that's still available i believe from the united nations
[2:46:48.480 --> 2:46:52.880]  if you look at the pictures it shows pictures of
[2:46:52.880 --> 2:46:57.440]  indigent people who it's better to die
[2:46:57.440 --> 2:47:02.640]  than to live yeah they say oh their life isn't happy oh isn't suicide good
[2:47:02.640 --> 2:47:06.800]  isn't euthanasia we see newsweek the case for killing granny
[2:47:06.800 --> 2:47:10.800]  all these articles we're being sold that death is actually compassionate
[2:47:10.800 --> 2:47:14.800]  oh don't help people just kill them that's right thank you thank you herman i
[2:47:14.800 --> 2:47:18.800]  appreciate the call terry in ohio terrier on the air
[2:47:18.800 --> 2:47:24.800]  yes alex yes hey i got a question um i'm the pastor but here's my thing you've
[2:47:24.800 --> 2:47:29.920]  been doing this and he's talking about too as far as this banking their bankers
[2:47:29.920 --> 2:47:33.840]  well you've even asked and you've asked for solutions and things like that and
[2:47:33.840 --> 2:47:37.520]  people are looking for solutions and i think i've come up with one
[2:47:37.520 --> 2:47:43.520]  and and here it is if everybody quit paying on their credit cards because the
[2:47:43.520 --> 2:47:46.240]  bankers these bankers are going to bank up the banks
[2:47:46.240 --> 2:47:49.520]  anyway they're going to take their money out of the banks
[2:47:49.520 --> 2:47:52.880]  and and i know this is going to have an effect because
[2:47:52.880 --> 2:47:56.560]  three hundred and sixteen thousand people have left california
[2:47:56.560 --> 2:48:00.880]  and look at the effect it's having on that if people in every state
[2:48:00.880 --> 2:48:04.320]  just up and just quit paying on their credit cards just
[2:48:04.320 --> 2:48:08.240]  up and stop it and not paying nothing
[2:48:08.240 --> 2:48:12.640]  then they would start losing their money and then we can start taking
[2:48:12.640 --> 2:48:16.960]  well i'll say this i mean i'll say this is a very complex issue
[2:48:16.960 --> 2:48:20.880]  but but but yes the banks would then just get a bailout to themselves of our
[2:48:20.880 --> 2:48:23.840]  tax money to pay it but by people not and i'm not
[2:48:23.840 --> 2:48:27.280]  saying do this it's your decision by not supporting the system
[2:48:27.280 --> 2:48:30.640]  before they're ready to crash it that will screw them up and that's why they
[2:48:30.640 --> 2:48:33.760]  want global government they talk about tax avoidance
[2:48:33.760 --> 2:48:37.760]  they say they want an 87 total tax rate worldwide
[2:48:37.760 --> 2:48:41.680]  so people don't run from their control and that's why they hate it people are
[2:48:41.680 --> 2:48:44.640]  leaving massachusetts new york california
[2:48:44.640 --> 2:48:48.240]  to states where they can still have a little bit lower taxes and survive
[2:48:48.240 --> 2:48:51.680]  that's why the globalists come in and finance higher taxes locally
[2:48:51.680 --> 2:48:55.520]  so you have nowhere to run and this is a very key point you brought up
[2:48:55.520 --> 2:48:58.960]  that we need to debate more and discuss more let me get a comment from george
[2:48:58.960 --> 2:49:04.160]  hunt on what you just discussed well you know i never thought of those
[2:49:04.160 --> 2:49:08.960]  ways that we could prevent these people from doing
[2:49:08.960 --> 2:49:13.520]  their dirty deeds i think the credit card ideas are good one
[2:49:13.520 --> 2:49:18.960]  but could you get all the people and in the united states to do it together
[2:49:18.960 --> 2:49:24.240]  because if you're the only one that does that you're going to lose
[2:49:24.240 --> 2:49:29.200]  well also again they're putting their cashless thumbprint face scan buying and
[2:49:29.200 --> 2:49:33.040]  selling in so that if you're not in good graces with
[2:49:33.040 --> 2:49:36.240]  homeland security and the global securities network they've set up an
[2:49:36.240 --> 2:49:39.840]  inner pole you won't be allowed to buy and sell even if you have the cash
[2:49:39.840 --> 2:49:42.800]  that's what the cashless society is you'll still have cash
[2:49:42.800 --> 2:49:46.640]  you've just got an id to do it and they've openly announced they want that i
[2:49:46.640 --> 2:49:50.400]  mean they are coming in to squeeze you they want to bankrupt you they want to
[2:49:50.400 --> 2:49:54.720]  control you i think for for people who can
[2:49:54.720 --> 2:49:57.760]  get into communities or loosely knit organizations
[2:49:57.760 --> 2:50:03.120]  rurally that decide to defend each other decide to get each other out of debt
[2:50:03.120 --> 2:50:06.000]  and then you've just got to wait for the tanks to come down the street
[2:50:06.000 --> 2:50:09.600]  whenever that happens and still be politically involved to try to stop that
[2:50:09.600 --> 2:50:12.880]  from happening you've got to prepare for the worst
[2:50:12.880 --> 2:50:17.840]  but also fight to stop it again everything's multifaceted
[2:50:17.840 --> 2:50:21.440]  yeah but uh you see you can't just hide out in the country and wait for them to
[2:50:21.440 --> 2:50:24.960]  come but you've also got to have communities get to know your neighbors
[2:50:24.960 --> 2:50:28.080]  understand who the enemy is and say we're going to stick together everything
[2:50:28.080 --> 2:50:33.120]  the globalists do is about dividing us so we can't stick together so they can
[2:50:33.120 --> 2:50:36.800]  individually come like wolves and rip our guts out
[2:50:36.800 --> 2:50:41.600]  that's what they do overseas too they get the chiites against the lusites
[2:50:41.600 --> 2:50:44.480]  against the jevisites and they get these
[2:50:44.480 --> 2:50:48.640]  because they wild the countries up by getting the religions fighting against

[2:56:33.520 --> 2:56:36.880]  and we made it all official but during that time
[2:56:36.880 --> 2:56:40.640]  i questioned the dollar wanted to find out everything i could about the dollar
[2:56:40.640 --> 2:56:44.240]  the bottom line is uh... we found out everything we needed to know
[2:56:44.240 --> 2:56:47.280]  and i thought all the stuff that i was learning about that or william theory
[2:56:47.280 --> 2:56:50.320]  about 1984 i thought initially was a joke
[2:56:50.320 --> 2:56:53.920]  uh... and it's not the stuff is real on forty three
[2:56:53.920 --> 2:56:58.480]  i know it's very real uh... but you've actually inspired me to start another

[3:01:07.520 --> 3:01:12.320]  hey how you doing good i've been meaning to call for a long time and it's
[3:01:12.320 --> 3:01:17.440]  crazy how apropos call will be today but i've moved into the sticks
[3:01:17.440 --> 3:01:20.880]  uh early nineties about the same time period
[3:01:20.880 --> 3:01:24.080]  and i became associated with someone who claimed to be
[3:01:24.080 --> 3:01:28.000]  in league or new of the elites and was close personal friends with him
[3:01:28.000 --> 3:01:31.760]  he tapped me as a guy who was intelligent and for some reason
[3:01:31.760 --> 3:01:35.680]  wanted me to know some facts and not he asked me if i ever knew about
[3:01:35.680 --> 3:01:38.880]  the new world order and trilateral commission and those things and
[3:01:38.880 --> 3:01:43.680]  i told my new some things and so he i he invited me to ask him some questions
[3:01:43.680 --> 3:01:48.080]  i said how will we know when the new world order is going to be installed
[3:01:48.080 --> 3:01:52.640]  or first first i said how will how will they go about installing it so they'll
[3:01:52.640 --> 3:01:56.000]  get us in so many conflicts around the globe that we won't be able to defend
[3:01:56.000 --> 3:02:00.640]  ourselves and a seemingly foreign power would step in and take us over
[3:02:00.640 --> 3:02:03.920]  i said how will we know when it's about to happen
[3:02:03.920 --> 3:02:06.960]  and he said if they ever hit the pentagon look out
[3:02:06.960 --> 3:02:12.000]  and it was whenever 9 11 happened to me and of course that was years before that
[3:02:12.000 --> 3:02:15.440]  and this guy said that he was a member of the elite
[3:02:15.440 --> 3:02:20.640]  he was affiliated with him he was a very intelligent man they love to brag george
[3:02:20.640 --> 3:02:25.600]  hunt comments on what bob just said oh they love to brag and i wish that
[3:02:25.600 --> 3:02:29.120]  you had a recorder with you when you're talking to that
[3:02:29.120 --> 3:02:33.360]  person they were one of the ones that were in the know
[3:02:33.360 --> 3:02:37.280]  and they liked and people to know that they're in the know
[3:02:37.280 --> 3:02:40.480]  but if anyone finds out that they told their secrets
[3:02:40.480 --> 3:02:44.880]  they get killed bob call us back again call us back again
[3:02:44.880 --> 3:02:48.080]  sometime because i want to hear more of your story thank you finishing up george
[3:02:48.080 --> 3:02:51.440]  go ahead well i don't know how to finish this except
[3:02:51.440 --> 3:02:56.240]  that uh we are confronted with a new world order
[3:02:56.240 --> 3:03:00.640]  that will take away the freedom of every citizen in the world
[3:03:00.640 --> 3:03:05.360]  and if we don't if we don't if we don't call them out now
[3:03:05.360 --> 3:03:10.640]  we never will this is our last chance you said i agree with you you said it
[3:03:10.640 --> 3:03:13.760]  earlier though this is the moment of truth they're coming in like a flood but
[3:03:13.760 --> 3:03:17.840]  the spirit of the lord is lifting up a standard against him and all of us myself
[3:03:17.840 --> 3:03:20.560]  you millions of others we are that standard
[3:03:20.560 --> 3:03:24.320]  against the enemy and and and when we do fight
[3:03:24.320 --> 3:03:27.920]  we beat them and so people need to see themselves as leaders
[3:03:27.920 --> 3:03:31.840]  wake up their friends their families their neighbors educate them films are a
[3:03:31.840 --> 3:03:35.200]  great way to do it radio shows are a great way to do it
[3:03:35.200 --> 3:03:39.280]  read books get educated yourself educate your city council
[3:03:39.280 --> 3:03:42.560]  when these environmentalists come around they want to steal your property
[3:03:42.560 --> 3:03:45.920]  brainwash your kids on record they've got to be stopped
[3:03:45.920 --> 3:03:49.600]  and george i'm glad you're doing an investigation on morris strong and
[3:03:49.600 --> 3:03:52.000]  others and you're talking about filing suit on them
[3:03:52.000 --> 3:03:55.360]  uh through the whistleblower international groups
[3:03:55.360 --> 3:03:58.960]  and when can we hear more about that coming up

[3:04:02.800 --> 3:04:08.480]  and um after i find a a lawyer that that is up to the fight
[3:04:08.480 --> 3:04:11.840]  and then after their suit they'll probably fade
[3:04:11.840 --> 3:04:16.800]  pay some heavy fines and i'll get 30% of their heavy fines because i'm an
[3:04:16.800 --> 3:04:21.200]  official whistleblower so there's something in it for
[3:04:21.200 --> 3:04:24.640]  people that blow whistle and you can use that to fight

[3:14:10.720 --> 3:14:13.840]  all the question was is i happened to be flipping through the history channel
[3:14:13.840 --> 3:14:18.080]  the other day and i saw earth 2100 i don't know if you've seen anything
[3:14:18.080 --> 3:14:21.680]  about this it's like a poorly animated like
[3:14:21.680 --> 3:14:26.080]  japanese cartoon about how this family's traveling from
[3:14:26.080 --> 3:14:30.240]  california to new york because there's nothing but famine
[3:14:30.240 --> 3:14:34.240]  on the west yes they've got scores of shows about death famine world
[3:14:34.240 --> 3:14:38.480]  government saving us everyone's starving or all these shows about
[3:14:38.480 --> 3:14:42.400]  humans are gone from the earth it's an eden how beautiful it would be if we
[3:14:42.400 --> 3:14:47.360]  were all dead it's just 24 7 creating a guilt complex
[3:14:47.360 --> 3:14:50.240]  just like they use you know you're a nazi if you don't want big government
[3:14:50.240 --> 3:14:53.440]  well you want to kill the earth if you don't want big government and so
[3:14:53.440 --> 3:14:58.240]  they're creating a guilt complex that i must kill myself it's for the earth
[3:14:58.240 --> 3:15:02.480]  it's terrible i mean it it just gets your blood boiling right away my son and i
[3:15:02.480 --> 3:15:05.680]  he's 18 we listen to you know we listen to your show every single day
[3:15:05.680 --> 3:15:08.240]  and it's like as soon as we saw that we watched it for a little while you know
[3:15:08.240 --> 3:15:11.360]  because we wanted to see what it was about we just couldn't do it
[3:15:11.360 --> 3:15:15.840]  so well we should we should download it online and do a review of it so it's
[3:15:15.840 --> 3:15:20.160]  called earth 2100 yes i think it i think it's history it might be discovery i'm
[3:15:20.160 --> 3:15:23.600]  not sure but don't worry i'm familiar i saw a blurb on it
[3:15:23.600 --> 3:15:27.440]  don't worry at the end of the episodes the global government will save us
[3:15:27.440 --> 3:15:32.400]  i'm sure there's an environmental group fighting globally to stop it they tried
[3:15:32.400 --> 3:15:38.640]  no one listened no one accepted christ savior roth child the christ
[3:15:38.640 --> 3:15:44.240]  i appreciate your call john david main dave you're on the air go ahead
[3:15:44.240 --> 3:15:49.200]  hi alex george mentioned earlier about um the possibility of using an emp and i
[3:15:49.200 --> 3:15:53.120]  wanted to remind the listeners of a book that was heavily pushed by newt
[3:15:53.120 --> 3:15:57.120]  gingrich called one second after that talked about the effects of a bunch of
[3:15:57.120 --> 3:16:00.480]  emps blaming on al-qaeda used the uh...
[3:16:00.480 --> 3:16:03.920]  the study showing emps would knock everything out but it would cause a lot
[3:16:03.920 --> 3:16:07.200]  of disruption to satellites and systems based on it
[3:16:07.200 --> 3:16:10.640]  and then use that as another false flag look when you're evil you don't have
[3:16:10.640 --> 3:16:14.240]  rules and you're the governing authority there's all these
[3:16:14.240 --> 3:16:19.920]  great ways to stage terror absolutely so we'd be ever a review of that book on
[3:16:19.920 --> 3:16:24.560]  on our website and also just published a review and highlights of a book written
[3:16:24.560 --> 3:16:27.200]  almost eighty years ago by birch and russell which is
[3:16:27.200 --> 3:16:31.360]  absolutely amazing the scientific tell us your website
[3:16:31.360 --> 3:16:36.080]  tell us your website dave something must break that net
[3:16:36.080 --> 3:16:39.840]  great and any good articles people want us to post their link to

[3:16:42.800 --> 3:16:46.400]  anything else uh... dave now that's it thanks
[3:16:46.400 --> 3:16:50.000]  uh... for all we do alex really appreciate it thank you so much dave
[3:16:50.000 --> 3:16:54.240]  it isn't that i mind the plugs it's just that sometimes every caller
[3:16:54.240 --> 3:16:58.480]  but i guess that's evidence of how people are taken action
[3:16:58.480 --> 3:17:01.600]  it just kills talk radio because people want to hear content they want to hear
[3:17:01.600 --> 3:17:04.720]  your ideas like hey they want to hear about emp and newt gingrich hyping it
[3:17:04.720 --> 3:17:07.520]  which you're right he did and and then it's
[3:17:07.520 --> 3:17:11.920]  then there's it's kind of overload but that's okay whatever
[3:17:11.920 --> 3:17:14.720]  i had to put a stop to it about ten years ago for a while when people started
[3:17:14.720 --> 3:17:18.000]  calling on i got a tractor for sale i'm in this town in
[3:17:18.000 --> 3:17:21.200]  missouri here's my number literally and i said look
[3:17:21.200 --> 3:17:25.120]  it stops there it stops

[3:18:21.920 --> 3:18:25.600]  let you guys know it i'm scared well you don't listen
[3:18:25.600 --> 3:18:29.200]  when you hang out over a cliff you get scared because that's instinct
[3:18:29.200 --> 3:18:32.240]  telling you get away from the cliff well the new world orders got us cornered
[3:18:32.240 --> 3:18:34.880]  we gotta fight him we can't get away from this cliff

[3:18:39.840 --> 3:18:45.440]  but once you put fear into action you don't have fear anymore my only fear is
[3:18:45.440 --> 3:18:47.920]  i'll get killed and won't be able to continue this work
[3:18:47.920 --> 3:18:51.600]  my only fear is that i don't do a good enough job my only fear is i won't work
[3:18:51.600 --> 3:18:54.960]  hard enough my only fear is i'll get worldly
[3:18:54.960 --> 3:18:58.560]  and want to take off a little bit of time but then i realize all work and no
[3:18:58.560 --> 3:19:04.400]  play makes jack adult boy and i've had to realize i beat myself up i can't do it
[3:19:04.400 --> 3:19:07.280]  all and that's why it's so great to see the
[3:19:07.280 --> 3:19:11.040]  dividends of liberty coming in and we're really starting to have victories

[3:24:38.560 --> 3:24:41.840]  and the fact is then once she gets in office she'll continue with the toll
[3:24:41.840 --> 3:24:45.440]  roads but she's desperate she's losing right now so she'll go ahead and tell
[3:24:45.440 --> 3:24:49.120]  the truth uh so that's coming up just an example
[3:24:49.120 --> 3:24:52.640]  of how these people operate
[3:24:53.360 --> 3:24:58.160]  also there's another video clip we were sent last night that we didn't post
[3:24:58.160 --> 3:25:02.160]  because we were too busy and didn't get around to it plus it's
[3:25:02.160 --> 3:25:05.040]  i don't know what i really think of the clip i'll tell you about it at the end
[3:25:05.040 --> 3:25:08.880]  of the show it'll be up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com it has
[3:25:08.880 --> 3:25:11.680]  been posted i'm not going to tell you what it is till
[3:25:11.680 --> 3:25:16.000]  we till we discuss it and i'll show you the headline once it's up on info
[3:25:16.000 --> 3:25:19.440]  wars dot com well we have erin right here just just
[3:25:19.440 --> 3:25:24.880]  have do give him the clip and erin can post it uh or perhaps it's been posted
[3:25:24.880 --> 3:25:28.800]  hasn't refreshed yet so something something particularly interesting
[3:25:28.800 --> 3:25:34.240]  uh coming up here before we end this broadcast okay
[3:25:34.240 --> 3:25:38.080]  i covered some of this in the first hour but
[3:25:38.080 --> 3:25:41.920]  the bigger news issue is that on every front
[3:25:41.920 --> 3:25:46.960]  people don't buy either political party now they're finally shattering
[3:25:46.960 --> 3:25:53.760]  the left right paradigm uh in a very very big way
[3:25:54.320 --> 3:25:58.800]  and the democrats have now
[3:25:59.840 --> 3:26:04.000]  seen the house and senate versions that are in conference both are very bad
[3:26:04.000 --> 3:26:08.400]  jail time uh five years in prison quarter million dollar fines if you don't buy
[3:26:08.400 --> 3:26:11.440]  the insurance and they take money out of your check and they tax
[3:26:11.440 --> 3:26:14.320]  better insurance plans you know they'll phase that into everything
[3:26:14.320 --> 3:26:18.160]  plus it's unconstitutional it's uh discriminatory
[3:26:18.160 --> 3:26:21.840]  uh both versions of the bill and they're leaving it in they're saying
[3:26:21.840 --> 3:26:27.440]  leave certain states out uh leave scores of big labor unions out their
[3:26:27.440 --> 3:26:31.200]  employees don't have to do this the rest of public does they become like little
[3:26:31.200 --> 3:26:34.320]  lords and little duchesses and little dukes and little
[3:26:34.320 --> 3:26:38.320]  little kings where it's all selectively done we saw that
[3:26:38.320 --> 3:26:41.520]  with obama if you were a democratic contributor you got to keep
[3:26:41.520 --> 3:26:45.120]  your general motors car dealership if you weren't you didn't that came out on
[3:26:45.120 --> 3:26:49.280]  this house floor and that's public uh if you're a globalist
[3:26:49.280 --> 3:26:53.200]  and contributed he'd give you billions to move the factories overseas
[3:26:53.200 --> 3:26:57.600]  uh and and it's been like this with presidents before him the last few
[3:26:57.600 --> 3:27:02.480]  decades but it's now coming to a head because they're going for
[3:27:02.480 --> 3:27:07.360]  broke and they don't care and this bill raises taxes by at least
[3:27:07.360 --> 3:27:11.040]  500 billion in the next 10 years that's conservative it's more like 700
[3:27:11.040 --> 3:27:15.360]  billion they're reporting 41 billion medicare cuts 30 something
[3:27:15.360 --> 3:27:19.760]  billion medicaid cuts every year the taxes go up benefits go down it gives
[3:27:19.760 --> 3:27:23.600]  immunity to the insurance companies and doctors and big hmo's to not give you
[3:27:23.600 --> 3:27:26.960]  care so it has the government coming in with these panels
[3:27:26.960 --> 3:27:30.160]  of non doctors deciding and setting policy for everyone
[3:27:30.160 --> 3:27:34.080]  we've seen it in canada we've seen it in england where you get rationed for
[3:27:34.080 --> 3:27:38.720]  healthcare tom dashill wrote the original bill he wrote a book calling for it
[3:27:38.720 --> 3:27:43.200]  i mean this is the reality this legislation is bad
[3:27:43.200 --> 3:27:47.280]  and i mean to say bad that's not even a strong enough word
[3:27:47.280 --> 3:27:51.040]  but then we have the associated press where other labor unions that aren't
[3:27:51.040 --> 3:27:54.240]  exempted from it they're getting angry they were fine
[3:27:54.240 --> 3:27:58.160]  with something immoral for other people other businesses corporations private
[3:27:58.160 --> 3:28:01.920]  companies private individuals but they don't like it that they're
[3:28:01.920 --> 3:28:04.480]  not exempt
[3:28:05.360 --> 3:28:09.920]  labor angry over obama backed insurance tax labor leaders are pushing hard on
[3:28:09.920 --> 3:28:13.280]  president barack obama and said democrats to drop a proposed new tax
[3:28:13.280 --> 3:28:17.040]  on high value healthcare plans warning of politicians
[3:28:17.040 --> 3:28:22.000]  and political consequences the white house has uh indicated the tax may change
[3:28:22.000 --> 3:28:25.840]  so it hits fewer workers but it's not going away and then now we've
[3:28:25.840 --> 3:28:29.600]  confirmed in conference they're just going to exempt some people from it
[3:28:29.600 --> 3:28:35.600]  continuing raw story dod health reform bill hanging by a thread
[3:28:35.600 --> 3:28:39.280]  and he goes into saying the democratic party people are exiting it
[3:28:39.280 --> 3:28:44.320]  they're panicking it may not even pass but see they did that foregone conclusion
[3:28:44.320 --> 3:28:48.240]  saying oh it will pass no way to stop it so you wouldn't lobby against it but
[3:28:48.240 --> 3:28:51.120]  there's still time the states also are saying they're
[3:28:51.120 --> 3:28:53.840]  going to fight it that's unconstitutional because certain states
[3:28:53.840 --> 3:28:56.560]  don't have to do it other states do the feds can't do that
[3:28:56.560 --> 3:29:01.200]  that's up for states to decide but the interesting thing is
[3:29:01.200 --> 3:29:04.720]  you read these democrats on raw story and what are they all saying on this
[3:29:04.720 --> 3:29:08.320]  morning there was 30 something comments 36 comments when i printed this i'm
[3:29:08.320 --> 3:29:12.480]  sure there's more now but i read every comment they all disagree
[3:29:12.480 --> 3:29:16.400]  it's not just liberals and labor unions it's everybody with an ounce of sense
[3:29:16.400 --> 3:29:20.400]  this bill is so bad if anyone could cause the democratic party lose control of
[3:29:20.400 --> 3:29:25.120]  what they call control of the house and senate
[3:29:25.120 --> 3:29:28.160]  and it goes if the democrats pass this love gift to the health insurance
[3:29:28.160 --> 3:29:32.560]  industry in the senate they will lose massively in the
[3:29:32.560 --> 3:29:37.440]  2010 i'm a lifelong liberal will not tolerate this sell out to big insurance
[3:29:37.440 --> 3:29:40.560]  and it's the same thing on every stinking comment
[3:29:40.560 --> 3:29:44.480]  they've broken the paradigm they get all they're going to get from washington
[3:29:44.480 --> 3:29:49.280]  is rape and robbery and pillaging no matter what party or what they do it's
[3:29:49.280 --> 3:29:53.440]  all a scam stay with us we're on the march

[3:33:19.840 --> 3:33:30.160]  coming up in the last segment i'm going to post at prisonplanet.com and info wars.com
[3:33:30.160 --> 3:33:35.280]  some amazing new video we can't play it on air the audio but we can play the video
[3:33:35.280 --> 3:33:42.400]  so that is coming up so stay with us for that they said they were going to post it on info
[3:33:42.400 --> 3:33:47.520]  wars.com and prisonplanet.com and i've seen the link from prison planet paul watson sent me but
[3:33:47.520 --> 3:33:54.000]  i can't see it the tiles are the top stories so we'll try to get it up on info wars.com
[3:33:54.560 --> 3:34:01.520]  as well instead of using im i'd use telephone with the guys try to get some confirmation from them
[3:34:02.720 --> 3:34:10.640]  people texting people there's a report where children teenagers only use 800 words a day
[3:34:10.640 --> 3:34:17.840]  now when the average person uses tens of thousands children as young as three can't talk now in the
[3:34:17.840 --> 3:34:23.360]  u.s and england from television and computers and i've even caught it in my office now everyone
[3:34:23.360 --> 3:34:28.880]  just im's and emails and then stuff just falls through the cracks where if people just pick up
[3:34:28.880 --> 3:34:36.160]  a telephone or talk face to face there'd be clear communication on it and i'm not criticizing anybody
[3:34:36.160 --> 3:34:42.160]  we also have a lot of remote people that work in other parts of well england and new mexico
[3:34:44.160 --> 3:34:54.080]  getting back to the news here dodd health reform bill hanging by a thread and the democrats are
[3:34:54.640 --> 3:34:59.200]  properly addressing this that is the democrat constituents people calling themselves liberals
[3:34:59.200 --> 3:35:05.680]  they're saying it's a health care takeover a scam a fraud a looting raising taxes and cutting benefits
[3:35:05.680 --> 3:35:10.720]  but of course you never get something free when the government robs another group they keep it
[3:35:11.520 --> 3:35:16.000]  there is no free lunch don't you get it now the right wingers are attacking this from the wrong
[3:35:16.000 --> 3:35:21.360]  perspective saying it's commies that want to run our lives and well they want to run your lives but
[3:35:21.360 --> 3:35:26.400]  they're not commies they're big banks they're big insurance companies who can go write unconstitutional
[3:35:26.400 --> 3:35:31.920]  legislation to make you buy their overpriced insurance or put you in prison if you don't
[3:35:31.920 --> 3:35:38.480]  and then cut the quality of your care so the left's got it part right the right's got it partly right
[3:35:39.200 --> 3:35:42.800]  ladies and gentlemen get out of your left right paradigm but the good news is
[3:35:44.400 --> 3:35:49.600]  senator dodd who says he's leaving the senate uh says on his way out the door retiring senator
[3:35:49.600 --> 3:35:55.280]  chris dodd has some bad news for health reform advocates still cheering the late december senate
[3:35:55.280 --> 3:36:02.160]  vote health core reform is having is hanging by a thread and one or two votes could determine the
[3:36:02.160 --> 3:36:09.120]  outcome of the heavily debated bill democrat senator chris dodd told cnbc monday the cable
[3:36:09.120 --> 3:36:16.000]  business news network reports dodd said uh you would have to be living on the moon not to know
[3:36:16.000 --> 3:36:20.480]  that senators have already gone on record with having issues with the plan citing nebraska's
[3:36:20.480 --> 3:36:25.440]  been nelson connecticut's jail laborman and senator blanche lincoln from arkansas because they know
[3:36:25.440 --> 3:36:31.760]  it's political suicide to go for it everyone feels i guess to some degree who have been for this that
[3:36:31.760 --> 3:36:36.800]  we would have liked something different and that it's not uncommon when you're considering an issue
[3:36:36.800 --> 3:36:42.640]  of this magnitude he said if this is all about surviving politically then we're missing the
[3:36:42.640 --> 3:36:47.120]  whole purpose of what we're supposed to be doing yeah destroying america so the point is they all
[3:36:47.120 --> 3:36:52.560]  know that people are wise now that's why they tried to keep the bill secret remember that's why it's
[3:36:52.560 --> 3:36:57.920]  in secret conference committee now what they're doing with it our supposed free society the
[3:36:57.920 --> 3:37:03.440]  immigration bill three years ago was secret we got it total amnesty even for felons and they could
[3:37:03.440 --> 3:37:12.080]  bring in six of their family members uh on and on and on everything is a fraud no bid contracts
[3:37:12.080 --> 3:37:17.440]  the media says well it should only be american companies that get the military contracts that
[3:37:17.440 --> 3:37:22.640]  was a red herring it was only american companies it was no bid for other american companies see
[3:37:22.640 --> 3:37:30.800]  it's just everything is spin and fraud but the good news is this giant lie is coming down on
[3:37:30.800 --> 3:37:37.120]  its head in a big way and the people are finally getting it and finally understanding what's
[3:37:37.120 --> 3:37:43.840]  happening on another issue of a big awakening that's taking place we got the secret mic report
[3:37:43.840 --> 3:37:50.160]  in the homeland security report that listed gun owners conservatives returning veterans libertarians
[3:37:50.160 --> 3:37:58.240]  anti-fetal reserve people as potential terrorist there's a big article paul watson wrote today at
[3:37:58.240 --> 3:38:07.040]  prison planet dot com obama's tsa nominee targets anti-government christians targets anti-government
[3:38:07.040 --> 3:38:15.280]  christians and then it has the video clip of him saying it and it's got him in his tsa uniform
[3:38:16.080 --> 3:38:21.520]  down at the bottom and try to pull that article up and see if we can know obama's tsa nominee
[3:38:21.520 --> 3:38:26.640]  targets anti-government christians we can just show people the image of this guy before the show
[3:38:26.640 --> 3:38:34.800]  ends and they are mixing in people that don't want bigger government christians just like janet
[3:38:34.800 --> 3:38:39.360]  reno told 60 minutes people believe in a second coming of christ are mentally ill cult members
[3:38:39.360 --> 3:38:44.240]  and terrorist and that's a quote these these people are the weirdos these people are the ones
[3:38:44.240 --> 3:38:50.880]  that want to demonize freedom of religion and assembly in this country and they're and he says
[3:38:50.880 --> 3:39:00.560]  the main focus is on christian conservatives so i mean these guys are just right out in the open

[3:43:30.240 --> 3:43:36.240]  doing to you kopenhagen summit turned junket exclusive cbs news at least 20 members of congress
[3:43:36.240 --> 3:43:40.000]  made the trip to climate gate conference in kopenhagen last month and the millions and
[3:43:40.000 --> 3:43:45.840]  millions of dollars they spilled a spent to do it here's that other article uh that i mentioned
[3:43:45.840 --> 3:43:52.800]  teenagers only use 800 different words a day many children uh ages three can't even talk
[3:43:52.800 --> 3:43:57.120]  just were being turned into just mindless drones pretty soon if you can talk and tie your shoelaces
[3:43:57.120 --> 3:44:00.800]  you'll be known as a genius their brains are so filled with mercury the government thinks you're
[3:44:00.800 --> 3:44:05.680]  so dumb they tell you mercury's good for you uh ed brown receives virtual death sentence for
[3:44:05.680 --> 3:44:12.320]  resisting government curtain mo info wars dot com all the details there 37 years in prison uh he'd be
[3:44:12.320 --> 3:44:18.800]  over 107 years old when he gets out you usually serve 90 plus percent about 92 percent of a federal
[3:44:18.800 --> 3:44:23.280]  sentence so that means he'll be about 100 years old or more when he gets out just absolutely
[3:44:23.280 --> 3:44:29.840]  criminal but meanwhile geithner doesn't have to pay his taxes it could steal 220 something trillion
[3:44:29.840 --> 3:44:37.120]  billion in front of everybody and doesn't get in trouble but they get thrown in the slammer
[3:44:37.120 --> 3:44:50.800]  so that is going on now continuing here the media is trying to push distractions like
[3:44:50.800 --> 3:44:57.600]  Trent lot who was just and you know saying something mildly that could be called racist
[3:44:57.600 --> 3:45:03.120]  and then having to step down as leadership in the senate now harry reid i don't like harry
[3:45:03.120 --> 3:45:08.240]  reid i hate his guts he's a very wicked globalist robbing us he comes out and this has been the
[3:45:08.240 --> 3:45:12.960]  big news the last four or five days i haven't covered it but i want to mention it now harry
[3:45:12.960 --> 3:45:20.160]  reid comes out and it gets released in a big book that he said oh it's great you know americans
[3:45:20.160 --> 3:45:26.400]  wouldn't vote for him but he's light skinned and and doesn't have a ethnic dialect he was pushing
[3:45:26.400 --> 3:45:34.960]  obama to run he's obama's friend he's saying what he thinks of as racist america will go for obama
[3:45:34.960 --> 3:45:40.160]  and it was reid that got him to do it but see that's just a political football meant to train
[3:45:40.160 --> 3:45:46.640]  republicans to support political correctness to rush in and call for his head no lot shouldn't
[3:45:46.640 --> 3:45:52.880]  have to step down he should step down he's a crook uh but not for that reason and reid
[3:45:52.880 --> 3:45:56.720]  shouldn't have to step down for that he should step down because he's a crook violating senate
[3:45:56.720 --> 3:46:01.840]  rules in the constitution but see that's how they train you to accept political correctness and all
[3:46:01.840 --> 3:46:10.640]  of this is by having republicans now enforce it on on harry reid so uh that's going on there
[3:46:10.640 --> 3:46:19.520]  republican site lot in calling for reid to quit now the other big issue is what happened with
[3:46:19.520 --> 3:46:27.040]  flugate and it is flugate the head of the eu health council has admitted they were lied to
[3:46:27.040 --> 3:46:32.640]  they were told tens of millions would die it was all a fraud by big government for a power grab
[3:46:32.640 --> 3:46:37.520]  with uh pharmaceutical makers to make tens of billions of dollars with the big five makers they
[3:46:37.520 --> 3:46:43.040]  lied uh and they in these reports the eu health chief he'll get in trouble now watch
[3:46:43.760 --> 3:46:47.920]  since it's a dangerous vaccine the german government wouldn't even take it themselves
[3:46:47.920 --> 3:46:53.440]  remember that everything we told you about how it was a fraud how it was a scam how the
[3:46:53.440 --> 3:46:57.680]  vaccine was dangerous how the government was quietly getting ready before april before you
[3:46:57.680 --> 3:47:02.000]  heard anything about flu to push this hype we knew they were getting ready for that so we
[3:47:02.000 --> 3:47:07.120]  warned the public everything we've said has now been completely proven for all these talk show hosts
[3:47:07.120 --> 3:47:11.840]  like godardina dell that say the vaccine's safe and everybody needs to take it and it's not hype
[3:47:11.840 --> 3:47:16.320]  that's been totally disproven everybody in your family who got in your face and said you better
[3:47:16.320 --> 3:47:20.800]  take it give them the bbc reports the alga zero video reports i'm going to play that at the start
[3:47:20.800 --> 3:47:25.200]  of the rebroadcast at the start of the show we played that alga zero report the videos up on
[3:47:25.200 --> 3:47:33.840]  info wars dot com we have been proven absolutely correct absolutely right on all of this we know
[3:47:33.840 --> 3:47:38.640]  how the globalists operate we know how their programs operate we know what they do we know
[3:47:38.640 --> 3:47:43.360]  their systems we know their scams and more and more people are listening to what we have to say
[3:47:43.360 --> 3:47:48.400]  and realizing that we've been telling people the truth all along and that we really know what
[3:47:48.400 --> 3:47:54.960]  we're talking about are we perfect no do we make mistakes yes but do we have the best handle on
[3:47:54.960 --> 3:47:59.920]  what's going on of any news websites or any radio show or any documentary filmmakers
[3:48:00.480 --> 3:48:05.920]  we are the number one leaders of alternative news info wars dot com is the biggest alternative news
[3:48:05.920 --> 3:48:11.120]  site on the web by alexa and all the rating services prison planet dot com is number two
[3:48:11.120 --> 3:48:18.480]  we have both the top spots we are the leaders and the most successful viral video makers

[3:48:28.480 --> 3:48:33.200]  all the republic free online people've gotten the thousands of dvds from us made hundreds of
[3:48:33.200 --> 3:48:38.720]  thousands of millions of copies one university over 30 000 were handed out by the great folks
[3:48:38.720 --> 3:48:44.560]  at freedoms phoenix there the point is we are having a huge effect and that's why k belly
[3:48:44.560 --> 3:48:51.120]  hutchinson is running videos like the one we're about to play and it just has text over traffic
[3:48:51.120 --> 3:48:56.960]  sounds so i will narrate for radio listeners she now is having to come out with an anti-newworld order
[3:48:58.000 --> 3:49:04.160]  peace about toll roads as a land grab to try to beat perry when she's even more involved and i'm
[3:49:04.160 --> 3:49:09.280]  not saying i'm going to vote for perry either lesser of two weevils or two evils the point is
[3:49:09.280 --> 3:49:15.280]  they are in total panic mode as all this information becomes mainstream they're having to take on our
[3:49:15.280 --> 3:49:21.680]  political coloration of patriots and liberty people to try to win and people are seeing through
[3:49:21.680 --> 3:49:34.480]  that so here is bill berg group steering committee member k belly hutchinson's tv ad
[3:49:36.400 --> 3:49:46.000]  it's a great ad it's got images of those highway signs where they talk about it being a land grab
[3:49:46.000 --> 3:49:55.280]  a foreign company toll roads it's time to end the trans texas corridor and see they said last year
[3:49:55.280 --> 3:49:58.880]  oh we've canceled it but they're continuing the whole thing they're not they're just not calling
[3:49:58.880 --> 3:50:06.160]  it trans texas corridor the ap have the headline saying that oh it's been canceled but then saying

[3:50:11.680 --> 3:50:22.080]  try to read as much of that as i can for radio listeners this is a free road for now rick perry
[3:50:22.080 --> 3:50:29.680]  wants it to be a toll road the road your taxes already paid for a grant a giant perry land grab
[3:50:30.400 --> 3:50:36.720]  like the 600 000 acres he tried to take from texas so a foreign company could charge tolls too
[3:50:36.720 --> 3:50:43.840]  it's time to end the trans texas corridor paid for by k belly hutchinson but she doesn't tell you
[3:50:43.840 --> 3:50:48.160]  she works for the very same globalist she doesn't tell you she's been involved in this whole program
[3:50:48.160 --> 3:50:53.440]  she doesn't tell you it's a larger nationwide land grab under the nap to super highway system
