[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  There's a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:12.000 --> 00:26.000]  Alex Jones, the four-way conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[00:26.000 --> 00:30.000]  Alex Jones.
[00:30.000 --> 00:35.000]  Stop Russian, stop.
[00:35.000 --> 00:41.000]  Until war comes to mind.
[00:41.000 --> 00:52.000]  Reputation's amazing. I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[00:52.000 --> 00:55.000]  I'll take care of you now, and then later.
[00:55.000 --> 01:01.000]  If you took your six-month-old baby and dropped it on its head on purpose,
[01:01.000 --> 01:05.000]  you would lose that child if you were seen doing it, and you should.
[01:05.000 --> 01:08.000]  If you're wondering why it's like a zombie apocalypse out there,
[01:08.000 --> 01:14.000]  and why there's mental illness everywhere, and why people seem so incredibly stupid,
[01:14.000 --> 01:25.000]  it's because the Soviets, the Communist, the proto-globalists that took over had work camps,
[01:25.000 --> 01:36.000]  and they put hydrofluorosalic acid in the water and lots of other stuff to test it on the people in the gulags.
[01:36.000 --> 01:46.000]  I went to H.E.B. this morning, the crew did, walked right in, it says H.E.B. baby fluoride water.
[01:46.000 --> 01:50.000]  Let's zoom right in on that, and notice it shows you the target.
[01:50.000 --> 02:00.000]  It's kind of like buying a box of 30-odd six rifle shells, rifle rounds, and on the covers a deer.
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.000]  There's a little crosshair on the side of the deer.
[02:06.000 --> 02:16.000]  I have you now.
[02:16.000 --> 02:23.000]  Target, maximum firepower.
[02:23.000 --> 02:33.000]  Oh, baby, it's time to kill brain cells. So much more fun to take our time.
[02:33.000 --> 02:47.000]  And then it's bye-bye brain, and you've got a good automaton.
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  Infowars, tomorrow's news, today.
[02:50.000 --> 02:55.000]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted, I think they are horrible for our society.
[02:55.000 --> 02:57.000]  Why are they doing this now?
[02:57.000 --> 03:00.000]  Well, it's a good question as to why they waited this long, but...
[03:00.000 --> 03:02.000]  Yes, exactly.
[03:02.000 --> 03:08.000]  I mean, so Alex Jones has been banned from Facebook for a long period of time, but now they banned him,
[03:08.000 --> 03:11.000]  they banned his little underling, Paul Joseph Watson.
[03:11.000 --> 03:16.000]  Now that they kicked them off the platform, that's great for now, but it doesn't roll back the clock.
[03:16.000 --> 03:20.000]  Well, you have also excesses in the First Amendment and the Second Amendment right now.
[03:20.000 --> 03:25.000]  You know, I don't think that the forefathers said, well, you can say all sorts of hateful things
[03:25.000 --> 03:29.000]  and spread it around the world, literally spread it through the internet.
[03:29.000 --> 03:33.000]  I have no issue with it at all. I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted,
[03:33.000 --> 03:36.000]  I think they are horrible for our society.
[03:36.000 --> 03:41.000]  I want them shut down, I want them silenced, I want them muted.
[03:41.000 --> 03:45.000]  But don't worry, these people aren't terrifying or anything.
[03:45.000 --> 03:50.000]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:50.000 --> 03:57.000]  I tend to say this a couple of times a week now, 20 years ago I didn't, but it's really true.
[03:57.000 --> 04:02.000]  We have reached what I could call a quickening.
[04:02.000 --> 04:05.000]  Everything's starting to come out.
[04:05.000 --> 04:09.000]  The eugenics, the plan for world government, the plan for depopulation,
[04:09.000 --> 04:15.000]  the plan to end humanity as we know it, the fact that the ruling establishment
[04:15.000 --> 04:24.000]  or a bunch of psychopaths and sociopaths who get entrance into the club by abusing children sexually.
[04:24.000 --> 04:30.000]  Yeah, truth is stranger than fiction and denying it has gotten in the position we're in,
[04:30.000 --> 04:38.000]  but there's no way that all the censorship and all the control is ever going to put the New World Order
[04:38.000 --> 04:39.000]  back together again.
[04:39.000 --> 04:44.000]  I mean, I was just reading all the studies of being fluoride causes massive brain damage in children.
[04:44.000 --> 04:49.000]  They still, and most of the major brands, put a huge dose in the formula.
[04:49.000 --> 04:51.000]  You wonder, are IQs so low?
[04:51.000 --> 04:57.000]  It's all on purpose, and by the way, they admit Obama's science art says they did it to make us stupid.
[04:57.000 --> 05:00.000]  Yeah, these are bad people.
[05:00.000 --> 05:07.000]  It's been a year since Info Wars and our other channels were completely banned off of YouTube.
[05:07.000 --> 05:11.000]  We're five billion views when we got banned and we're credited with getting Donald Trump elected
[05:11.000 --> 05:14.000]  because we were able to punch through and reach the grassroots.
[05:14.000 --> 05:22.000]  Now as we enter the 2020 election cycle, it's more important than ever that there be a place where the censors are unable to block the signal.
[05:22.000 --> 05:23.000]  And it's now here.
[05:23.000 --> 05:25.000]  Band.video.
[05:25.000 --> 05:33.000]  Band.video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives, nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life, pro-human individuals
[05:33.000 --> 05:40.000]  to have their own platform where videos banned by YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are still available.
[05:40.000 --> 05:44.000]  Watch your favorite content from media personalities banned by Big Tech.
[05:44.000 --> 05:45.000]  Works on every device.
[05:45.000 --> 05:48.000]  Take your shows on the go with Band.video.
[05:48.000 --> 05:54.000]  Watch live shows on demand content and join in on the conversation from anywhere with Band.video.
[05:54.000 --> 05:58.000]  Share videos with your friends via Facebook, Twitter, SMS, email and more.
[05:58.000 --> 06:13.000]  Band.video.
[06:13.000 --> 06:16.000]  This is the heart of 1776.
[06:16.000 --> 06:18.000]  You're a white male.
[06:18.000 --> 06:23.000]  It's also what happens when you listen to the radio host, Alex Jones.
[06:23.000 --> 06:24.000]  Move, bitch.
[06:24.000 --> 06:27.000]  Get out of the way.
[06:27.000 --> 06:34.000]  We pledge allegiance to one flag and that flag is the American flag.
[06:34.000 --> 06:38.000]  Info warriors helped fuel the rumor that President Obama is an ISIS supporter.
[06:38.000 --> 06:42.000]  It's been a cozy relationship from the beginning.
[06:42.000 --> 06:43.000]  I will not let you down.
[06:43.000 --> 06:48.000]  You'll be very, very impressed, I hope, and I think we'll be speaking a lot.
[06:48.000 --> 06:50.000]  Donald Trump and Alex Jones.
[06:50.000 --> 06:56.000]  This means that Donald Trump will be the 45th president of the United States.
[06:56.000 --> 06:59.000]  A raging war on corruption.
[06:59.000 --> 07:08.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[07:08.000 --> 07:13.000]  It's September 5th, 2019.
[07:13.000 --> 07:15.000]  I'm your host, Alex Jones.
[07:15.000 --> 07:20.000]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[07:20.000 --> 07:25.000]  It's always a struggle these days to say what the top story is.
[07:25.000 --> 07:30.000]  10 years ago, 20 years ago, 25 years ago, it was always evident what your top story was.
[07:30.000 --> 07:35.000]  But now, I just really can't say.
[07:35.000 --> 07:40.000]  Probably Bernie Sanders and other candidates on the CNN climate change,
[07:40.000 --> 07:45.000]  that means depopulation forum on CNN last night,
[07:45.000 --> 07:50.000]  say we need to abort people to depopulate the planet to save the earth.
[07:50.000 --> 07:53.000]  The message that humans are inherently bad.
[07:53.000 --> 08:00.000]  Now, that's really what goes on at the Rockefeller and Carnegie Endowments
[08:00.000 --> 08:04.000]  and through the Albert Einstein Institute,
[08:04.000 --> 08:11.000]  who its main division on population control was run by Jeffrey Epstein for
[08:11.000 --> 08:19.000]  Bill and Melinda Gates, David O'Rourkefeller, Ted Turner, Warren Buffett,
[08:19.000 --> 08:26.000]  and of course, a lot of other folks like Oprah Winfrey.
[08:26.000 --> 08:31.000]  So when you see him up there talking about depopulation and all the rest of it,
[08:31.000 --> 08:34.000]  that we're going to play that clip next segment,
[08:34.000 --> 08:39.000]  remember that there's a larger agenda behind this, not just depopulation,
[08:39.000 --> 08:42.000]  but the post-human era.
[08:42.000 --> 08:49.000]  And that has been the plan of the Eugenicists since 1856,
[08:49.000 --> 08:53.000]  when it was adopted by the British crown as their world policy,
[08:53.000 --> 09:01.000]  and then was finalized and publicly put out in 1962 as the post-human era
[09:01.000 --> 09:06.000]  via the merger of human and machine via cybernetic symbiosis.
[09:06.000 --> 09:15.000]  And I read to you from DARPA documents from ARPA in 1962 from the director
[09:15.000 --> 09:19.000]  saying the post-human world, the merger of man and machine,
[09:19.000 --> 09:22.000]  and of course, the eradication of Homo sapien.
[09:22.000 --> 09:28.000]  It will be the new Homo sapien or Homo sapien,
[09:28.000 --> 09:33.000]  New Age is how it translates out of the Latin,
[09:33.000 --> 09:38.000]  New Age human, but first it must transcend us mere mortals.
[09:38.000 --> 09:41.000]  So whether you believe they'll ever actually implement this or not,
[09:41.000 --> 09:46.000]  they're in control and they've basically already built 90% of it.
[09:46.000 --> 09:48.000]  So our main mission is building a pro-human future,
[09:48.000 --> 09:51.000]  and a lot of you understand that, and I appreciate that,
[09:51.000 --> 09:54.000]  and you share the information, and it's all available to anybody.
[09:54.000 --> 09:57.000]  I'm not the person who first discovered this, I'm just popularizing it.
[09:57.000 --> 10:02.000]  Thanks to Matt Drudge, we got, last time I checked late last night,
[10:02.000 --> 10:06.000]  a million and a half visitors to our top-linked story.
[10:06.000 --> 10:10.000]  We had 5,000-plus visitors a second coming on during the show.
[10:10.000 --> 10:13.000]  A lot of people have never visited InfoWars.com yesterday, thanks to Drudge.
[10:13.000 --> 10:19.000]  Top-linking the story about Trump administration considering social credit score system
[10:19.000 --> 10:22.000]  to determine who can buy a gun.
[10:22.000 --> 10:25.000]  And I had Tom Pappard in here who writes for big league politics,
[10:25.000 --> 10:28.000]  runs some TV stations and things, and he's got some other sites as well,
[10:28.000 --> 10:31.000]  and he's hooked in with a Republican party.
[10:31.000 --> 10:33.000]  And he was getting calls yesterday saying,
[10:33.000 --> 10:35.000]  is Jones right, is this real?
[10:35.000 --> 10:39.000]  And Pappard said, it links to the Washington Post and the White Paper, it's completely real.
[10:39.000 --> 10:42.000]  And Ivanka Trump has made statements about it.
[10:42.000 --> 10:45.000]  They want all the little computers in your house, all the smart devices,
[10:45.000 --> 10:52.000]  all the Alexis, all the Google Assist, to give all the data over
[10:52.000 --> 10:57.000]  to Harpa being set up by DARPA, and the individuals that actually run Harpa,
[10:57.000 --> 11:00.000]  that's already actually operational in a beta test,
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  and both of the directors worked at the National Institutes of Health
[11:04.000 --> 11:10.000]  at the highest level for, you guessed it, Barack Hussein Obama?
[11:10.000 --> 11:14.000]  Oh, and it gets better, Hillary Rodham Clinton.
[11:14.000 --> 11:19.000]  Now, Trump's a delegator, and just because he's shown interest in this,
[11:19.000 --> 11:22.000]  and just because Ivanka is pushing, it doesn't mean it's going to happen.
[11:22.000 --> 11:25.000]  Just like they wanted him to do the red flag laws and he read a due process,
[11:25.000 --> 11:29.000]  and now he's totally against it because Trump got educated
[11:29.000 --> 11:31.000]  about being taken to the woodshed.
[11:31.000 --> 11:34.000]  And I don't take any pleasure in that, but we all had to do that, didn't we?
[11:34.000 --> 11:36.000]  Well, it's back again.
[11:36.000 --> 11:39.000]  And this thing is so draconian it'll make your head spin.
[11:39.000 --> 11:43.000]  So we have Tom Pappard, who's a smart cookie with us in the second hour.
[11:43.000 --> 11:46.000]  Mike Adams pops in on the Bernie Sanders eugenics push.
[11:46.000 --> 11:49.000]  Robert Barnes is with us at the bottom of the hour to hit some Pintel.
[11:49.000 --> 11:52.000]  We are going to be filing lawsuits next week.
[11:52.000 --> 11:54.000]  We've been a few weeks behind, but next week we're going to be filing
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.000]  some very important lawsuits in defense of America and free speech.
[11:57.000 --> 11:59.000]  So we'll have a first look at that.
[11:59.000 --> 12:03.000]  And Freeway Rick Ross, who was the largest ever admitted
[12:03.000 --> 12:06.000]  government narcotics trafficker for the Central Intelligence Agency,
[12:06.000 --> 12:08.000]  will be in studio with us.
[12:08.000 --> 12:10.000]  And of course Matt Bracken will host the fourth hour,
[12:10.000 --> 12:13.000]  former Navy SEAL bestselling author and a smart individual,
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  very informed as well.
[12:15.000 --> 12:18.000]  A lot of folks listen to him, so I hope you'll listen.
[12:18.000 --> 12:23.000]  Okay, here's what else we've got coming up for you.
[12:23.000 --> 12:28.000]  It's a lot.
[12:28.000 --> 12:31.000]  We have South Africans setting fire to other African migrants
[12:31.000 --> 12:34.000]  in a wave of xenophobic attacks.
[12:34.000 --> 12:36.000]  No, it's called tribalism.
[12:36.000 --> 12:39.000]  And they know how Africa works in the rest of the world
[12:39.000 --> 12:43.000]  before Christianity, where any outside group you let it get big enough
[12:43.000 --> 12:44.000]  will enslave you.
[12:44.000 --> 12:45.000]  That's how Africa works.
[12:45.000 --> 12:48.000]  So the Africans killing the other Africans
[12:48.000 --> 12:51.000]  understand how the ball bounces.
[12:51.000 --> 12:53.000]  So we're going to be explaining that.
[12:53.000 --> 12:54.000]  I'm not defending it.
[12:54.000 --> 12:56.000]  This is just what goes on.
[12:56.000 --> 12:58.000]  If you're not from South Africa and you're black,
[12:58.000 --> 13:01.000]  particularly, you get set on fire.
[13:01.000 --> 13:05.000]  But somehow Trevor Noah found a way to blame white people.
[13:05.000 --> 13:08.000]  I've got that video as well.
[13:08.000 --> 13:11.000]  No, there's been a 14 times increase in South Africa
[13:11.000 --> 13:13.000]  since apartheid was entered.
[13:13.000 --> 13:16.000]  I'm not defending apartheid, but it's like chopping your arm off
[13:16.000 --> 13:19.000]  so you shoot yourself in the head five times.
[13:19.000 --> 13:22.000]  apartheid's chopping your arm off.
[13:22.000 --> 13:25.000]  The communists running things always goes bad.
[13:25.000 --> 13:27.000]  I mean, it never goes well.
[13:27.000 --> 13:29.000]  So we'll be looking at that.
[13:29.000 --> 13:33.000]  Also, we're going to be looking at the latest Epstein information.
[13:33.000 --> 13:39.000]  That's the biggest information yet other than him mysteriously
[13:39.000 --> 13:41.000]  committing Arkansas there.
[13:41.000 --> 13:43.000]  So much more coming up today.
[13:43.000 --> 13:47.000]  But as we go to break, I want to just remind listeners,
[13:47.000 --> 13:49.000]  we are only here because of your tutelage,
[13:49.000 --> 13:51.000]  because of your patronage, because of your support,
[13:51.000 --> 13:55.000]  and I salute, and I thank you from the bottom of my heart.
[13:55.000 --> 13:58.000]  And I want to unveil a product that I believe,
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  because I've been taking it for several months,
[14:00.000 --> 14:02.000]  you may have noticed my clarity and focus
[14:02.000 --> 14:06.000]  in the last few weeks really tuning up.
[14:06.000 --> 14:09.000]  When we say it's a compliment to Brainforce,
[14:09.000 --> 14:11.000]  our best selling Neutropic,
[14:11.000 --> 14:13.000]  it's got all the known best selling,
[14:13.000 --> 14:15.000]  highest certified award winning ingredients.
[14:15.000 --> 14:17.000]  We didn't reinvent the wheel.
[14:17.000 --> 14:19.000]  That's why it's the best seller.
[14:19.000 --> 14:21.000]  We went out and found out with the best selling,
[14:21.000 --> 14:23.000]  high end ones where there were 80 bucks a bottle,
[14:23.000 --> 14:25.000]  and then we sell it usually for $35.
[14:25.000 --> 14:29.000]  This counted right now for like $29.
[14:29.000 --> 14:33.000]  But we went and looked at the latest research the last year,
[14:33.000 --> 14:37.000]  and it's not like knockout that's meant to make you go to sleep
[14:37.000 --> 14:40.000]  and has eight known ingredients to synergistically work together,
[14:40.000 --> 14:43.000]  like L-trip to fan and melatonin
[14:43.000 --> 14:46.000]  and other things to make you really sleep deeper.
[14:46.000 --> 14:50.000]  It's a, people love it, knockout.
[14:50.000 --> 14:53.000]  Chillforce is really meant to be taken
[14:53.000 --> 14:58.000]  with things like Brainforce or Turboforce,
[14:58.000 --> 15:01.000]  which even a big hit piece against Brainforce said,
[15:01.000 --> 15:04.000]  well, it did create focus, clarity, and smoother speech.
[15:04.000 --> 15:05.000]  The guy had to admit,
[15:05.000 --> 15:09.000]  wow, works way better than espresso without the crash.
[15:09.000 --> 15:13.000]  Exactly what Turboforce is designed to do.

[18:43.000 --> 18:44.000]  With these products I take,
[18:44.000 --> 18:46.000]  when I was literally remembering to take them,
[18:46.000 --> 18:48.000]  it's like a rocket fuel on the body.
[18:48.000 --> 18:50.000]  You take these bases together,
[18:50.000 --> 18:52.000]  then you have your foundation,
[18:52.000 --> 18:55.000]  now with these products I take,
[18:55.000 --> 18:56.000]  when I was literally remembering to take them,
[18:56.000 --> 18:57.000]  it makes my life so much better
[18:57.000 --> 18:59.000]  and then it funds the information war,
[18:59.000 --> 19:00.000]  which is so critical.
[19:00.000 --> 19:01.000]  Thank you so much, God bless you.
[19:01.000 --> 19:03.000]  And that's why we're introducing
[19:03.000 --> 19:05.000]  what we know is going to be a massive bestseller,
[19:05.000 --> 19:06.000]  Killforce.
[19:06.000 --> 19:09.000]  Now let's look at what's in this powerful formula.
[19:09.000 --> 19:11.000]  Ashwagandha root extract,
[19:11.000 --> 19:14.000]  an ancient medicinal herb used for over 3,000 years
[19:14.000 --> 19:16.000]  to treat stress and relax the patient.
[19:16.000 --> 19:19.000]  L-theony, a special amino acid naturally found
[19:19.000 --> 19:20.000]  in some tea leaves.
[19:20.000 --> 19:22.000]  The compound has been called the stress killer
[19:22.000 --> 19:25.000]  because of its powerful relaxation benefits.
[19:25.000 --> 19:27.000]  Gabba, an important neurotransmitter
[19:27.000 --> 19:29.000]  that controls functions of the body and mind,
[19:29.000 --> 19:31.000]  including nervous system relaxation.
[19:31.000 --> 19:34.000]  Gabba is a choice for many to help produce anxiety.
[19:34.000 --> 19:37.000]  Rodeola rosea root extract,
[19:37.000 --> 19:39.000]  found in the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.
[19:39.000 --> 19:42.000]  This root is considered a super adaptogen
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  and is believed to help the body
[19:44.000 --> 19:47.000]  in the fight against emotional, mental and physical stress.
[19:47.000 --> 19:49.000]  It's time to do what I did and take action
[19:49.000 --> 19:52.000]  with the Killforce Challenge at InfowarsLive.com.
[19:52.000 --> 20:21.000]  MUSIC
[20:21.000 --> 20:23.000]  From 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. I'm here live.
[20:23.000 --> 20:25.000]  I'm here host Alex Chipps.
[20:25.000 --> 20:27.000]  Before I go live every day, David Knight
[20:27.000 --> 20:29.000]  kicks him all off 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.
[20:29.000 --> 20:31.000]  with the David Knight Show.
[20:31.000 --> 20:33.000]  Informative, hard-hitting,
[20:33.000 --> 20:35.000]  extremely well-vetted and documented.
[20:35.000 --> 20:39.000]  Oh, and Troyer always on fire.
[20:39.000 --> 20:42.000]  3 p.m. Central.
[20:42.000 --> 20:45.000]  And we'll have some big announcements on Friday
[20:45.000 --> 20:47.000]  about some new shows that we're going to be carrying.
[20:47.000 --> 20:49.000]  We're just going to produce shows.
[20:49.000 --> 20:51.000]  We're going to be carrying some new shows
[20:51.000 --> 20:53.000]  that are already out there and established.
[20:53.000 --> 20:55.000]  A lot of big things.
[20:55.000 --> 20:57.000]  We will be, because I've been behind for a while,
[20:57.000 --> 20:59.000]  20 hours live a day very, very soon.
[20:59.000 --> 21:01.000]  We've been gearing up.
[21:01.000 --> 21:03.000]  We've been expanding.
[21:03.000 --> 21:05.000]  I've been spending every bit of money coming in
[21:05.000 --> 21:07.000]  to launch into 2020 to get the globalist
[21:07.000 --> 21:09.000]  as hard a run for their money as we possibly can.
[21:09.000 --> 21:11.000]  Okay, so let's get back to brass tacks.
[21:11.000 --> 21:13.000]  The world operating system
[21:13.000 --> 21:15.000]  of the mega corporations
[21:15.000 --> 21:17.000]  in the last really 50, 60 years
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  has been about
[21:19.000 --> 21:21.000]  planetary government to carry out
[21:21.000 --> 21:23.000]  forced depopulation.
[21:23.000 --> 21:25.000]  Now, remember, Hitler
[21:25.000 --> 21:27.000]  died
[21:27.000 --> 21:29.000]  at the end of World War II in the Berlin
[21:29.000 --> 21:31.000]  bunker under the Reichstag
[21:31.000 --> 21:33.000]  or the Reich's Chancellor, actually.
[21:35.000 --> 21:37.000]  But his ideas lived on,
[21:37.000 --> 21:39.000]  but Hitler didn't get his ideas
[21:39.000 --> 21:41.000]  from the Nazi Party.
[21:41.000 --> 21:43.000]  Hitler was funded by British intelligence,
[21:43.000 --> 21:45.000]  the National Socialist Workers' Party,
[21:45.000 --> 21:47.000]  the Causer-Villiam Institute was funded
[21:47.000 --> 21:49.000]  by the Rockefeller family,
[21:49.000 --> 21:51.000]  and it was funded by IBM.
[21:51.000 --> 21:53.000]  Now, that's all Pulitzer Prize winning
[21:53.000 --> 21:55.000]  New York Times number one best-selling books,
[21:55.000 --> 21:57.000]  and that's the history.
[21:57.000 --> 21:59.000]  I don't just believe those books.
[21:59.000 --> 22:01.000]  I've gone and read the source documents.
[22:01.000 --> 22:03.000]  I am someone of a World War II file.
[22:03.000 --> 22:05.000]  I've read over, let's not exaggerate,
[22:05.000 --> 22:07.000]  300 books probably or more
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  than encyclopedias on World War II.
[22:09.000 --> 22:11.000]  When you read it, it's all right there
[22:11.000 --> 22:13.000]  in order of the death set
[22:13.000 --> 22:15.000]  and rise and fall of Third Reich
[22:15.000 --> 22:17.000]  and all these famous books
[22:17.000 --> 22:19.000]  that Hitler wanted to carry out
[22:19.000 --> 22:21.000]  worldwide eugenics.
[22:21.000 --> 22:23.000]  But it gave it a bad name.
[22:23.000 --> 22:25.000]  Hitler gave it a bad name in their words.
[22:25.000 --> 22:27.000]  So the World Eugenics Society,
[22:27.000 --> 22:29.000]  headed up by Aldous Huxley's brother,
[22:29.000 --> 22:31.000]  Julian, became
[22:31.000 --> 22:33.000]  the World Transhumanist Society.
[22:35.000 --> 22:37.000]  So when you're in Hollywood
[22:37.000 --> 22:39.000]  or you're around billionaire hedge fund people
[22:39.000 --> 22:41.000]  in St. New York
[22:41.000 --> 22:43.000]  or Paris or London or Tokyo,
[22:43.000 --> 22:45.000]  you're not in the club
[22:47.000 --> 22:49.000]  unless you are a transhumanist,
[22:49.000 --> 22:51.000]  posthumanist
[22:51.000 --> 22:53.000]  who believes you're going to live forever and be God.
[22:55.000 --> 22:57.000]  Now, they can't outright kill us right away
[22:57.000 --> 22:59.000]  except with wars and famine.
[22:59.000 --> 23:01.000]  And HIV obviously was a race-specific bio-weapon.
[23:01.000 --> 23:03.000]  Whites can still get it, but it's very, very hard.
[23:03.000 --> 23:05.000]  They have cures for it.
[23:05.000 --> 23:07.000]  That's why Magic Johnson, all those folks who show life,
[23:07.000 --> 23:09.000]  it's well known.
[23:09.000 --> 23:11.000]  And my dad even told me that it's back when the thing
[23:11.000 --> 23:13.000]  was raging in the mid-1980s.
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  He said, son, that's a bio-weapon.
[23:15.000 --> 23:17.000]  Whites don't have the receptors for the
[23:17.000 --> 23:19.000]  system that attacks the T-limbs.
[23:19.000 --> 23:21.000]  I didn't roll my eyes, but it all later came out.
[23:21.000 --> 23:23.000]  I said, how do you know that, Dad?
[23:23.000 --> 23:25.000]  He just said, well, I've read some medical journals.
[23:25.000 --> 23:27.000]  Chris was, he was in Dallas talking
[23:27.000 --> 23:29.000]  to a lot of folks that worked for the government
[23:29.000 --> 23:31.000]  and it was an open secret.
[23:31.000 --> 23:33.000]  Now, let's just continue, ladies and gentlemen.
[23:33.000 --> 23:35.000]  This has all been beta-tested.
[23:35.000 --> 23:37.000]  It's a soft kill.
[23:37.000 --> 23:39.000]  People are riding your water, lowering your IQ,
[23:39.000 --> 23:41.000]  lowering your fertility.
[23:41.000 --> 23:43.000]  That doesn't kill you right away until you die of cancer,
[23:43.000 --> 23:45.000]  but it makes you statistically not able
[23:45.000 --> 23:47.000]  to have as many children.
[23:47.000 --> 23:49.000]  So it does kill people in the billions
[23:49.000 --> 23:51.000]  technically, in the aggregate.
[23:51.000 --> 23:53.000]  And so Sanders knocked
[23:53.000 --> 23:55.000]  for comments linking abortion
[23:55.000 --> 23:57.000]  to population control.
[23:57.000 --> 23:59.000]  Well, that's what Margaret Sanger is.
[23:59.000 --> 24:01.000]  That's what Planned Parenthood is.
[24:01.000 --> 24:03.000]  That's why in like New York state,
[24:03.000 --> 24:05.000]  70% of blacks never got born.
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.000]  100%!
[24:07.000 --> 24:09.000]  But black lives matter.
[24:09.000 --> 24:11.000]  It's funded by the very same institutions
[24:11.000 --> 24:13.000]  that are aborting the blacks.
[24:13.000 --> 24:15.000]  They want blacks to hate police,
[24:15.000 --> 24:17.000]  hate white people so that there's a racial division
[24:17.000 --> 24:19.000]  of the country pushed by leftists.
[24:19.000 --> 24:21.000]  And then, of course, they never look under their noses
[24:21.000 --> 24:23.000]  at how they're being exterminated.
[24:23.000 --> 24:25.000]  Billionaires try to shrink world population
[24:25.000 --> 24:27.000]  reports says, Associated Press.
[24:27.000 --> 24:29.000]  Again, oh,
[24:29.000 --> 24:31.000]  this is from 2009
[24:31.000 --> 24:33.000]  with Jeffrey Epstein, Bill Gates
[24:33.000 --> 24:35.000]  in New York.
[24:35.000 --> 24:37.000]  Sanders under fire for remarks on population control.
[24:37.000 --> 24:39.000]  Abortion of population control
[24:39.000 --> 24:41.000]  are important parts of addressing climate change.
[24:41.000 --> 24:43.000]  Get rid of the humans.
[24:43.000 --> 24:45.000]  And, of course, Bernie tells
[24:45.000 --> 24:47.000]  the crying baby to keep it down.
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  Let's play this little meme
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.000]  piece where Sanders did say
[24:51.000 --> 24:53.000]  keep out the baby quiet.
[24:53.000 --> 24:55.000]  He's a super rude jerk,
[24:55.000 --> 24:57.000]  mean to all his employees, known to be hateful,
[24:57.000 --> 24:59.000]  known to not tip. This has come out in the news recently,
[24:59.000 --> 25:01.000]  but I've been told people close to him.
[25:01.000 --> 25:03.000]  He stepped off and bankrupted a college,
[25:03.000 --> 25:05.000]  stole the money, gave jobs
[25:05.000 --> 25:07.000]  his whole family. He's a dirty criminal
[25:07.000 --> 25:09.000]  who never had a paycheck
[25:09.000 --> 25:11.000]  till he was 40.
[25:11.000 --> 25:13.000]  But he has a right to rule you
[25:13.000 --> 25:15.000]  and he will.
[25:15.000 --> 25:17.000]  So here he is
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  again, quiet to that baby down.
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  Here it is.
[25:21.000 --> 25:31.000]  He stepped out a little bit.
[25:31.000 --> 25:33.000]  Now, you know, we could joke about that all day,
[25:33.000 --> 25:35.000]  but here's what he really thinks about babies.
[25:35.000 --> 25:37.000]  Now, remember,
[25:37.000 --> 25:39.000]  all these globalists have gone to TED Talk
[25:39.000 --> 25:41.000]  and Bill Gates releases mosquitoes
[25:41.000 --> 25:43.000]  and he goes, here's the answer to a population
[25:43.000 --> 25:45.000]  mosquitoes, to reduce population.
[25:45.000 --> 25:47.000]  He lets mosquitoes loose.
[25:47.000 --> 25:49.000]  He's showing them what he's already really doing.
[25:49.000 --> 25:51.000]  Experienced mosquitoes in Florida.
[25:51.000 --> 25:53.000]  See, first he does it on a stage
[25:53.000 --> 25:55.000]  that he does it in real life.
[25:55.000 --> 25:57.000]  He's involved in the weather weapons,
[25:57.000 --> 25:59.000]  everything.
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  Chemtrailing, it's all declassified.
[26:01.000 --> 26:03.000]  Just like they're listening to you with devices in your house.
[26:03.000 --> 26:05.000]  Just like the fluoride brain damages you.
[26:05.000 --> 26:07.000]  And so they know exactly
[26:07.000 --> 26:09.000]  what they're doing.
[26:09.000 --> 26:11.000]  In that same talk, he said,
[26:11.000 --> 26:13.000]  we've got to reduce the CO2.
[26:13.000 --> 26:15.000]  It's going to kill the earth. That's what plants breathe.
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  Super trace gas. We need more of it.
[26:17.000 --> 26:19.000]  It used to be hundreds of times higher in our ancient past.
[26:19.000 --> 26:21.000]  We need it.
[26:21.000 --> 26:23.000]  But instead,
[26:23.000 --> 26:25.000]  he says we need to get rid of it,
[26:25.000 --> 26:27.000]  but humans also put it off.
[26:27.000 --> 26:29.000]  So we've got to reduce that number down to any shows.
[26:29.000 --> 26:31.000]  The human number at zero
[26:31.000 --> 26:33.000]  and the TED Talk group giggles and laughs
[26:33.000 --> 26:35.000]  because they're all leftist eugenicist
[26:35.000 --> 26:37.000]  types who, again,
[26:37.000 --> 26:39.000]  don't care about life. They're here as the rulers.
[26:39.000 --> 26:41.000]  They're here as the post-human group.
[26:41.000 --> 26:43.000]  They've been led in on the club.
[26:43.000 --> 26:45.000]  You understand that?
[26:45.000 --> 26:47.000]  And see, now they're externalizing the method.
[26:47.000 --> 26:49.000]  So here's Bernie Sanders
[26:49.000 --> 26:51.000]  in his hate letter to humanity.
[26:51.000 --> 26:53.000]  Here it is.
[26:53.000 --> 26:55.000]  This has more than doubled
[26:55.000 --> 26:57.000]  in the past 50 years.
[26:57.000 --> 26:59.000]  The planet cannot sustain this growth.
[26:59.000 --> 27:01.000]  I realize this is a poisonous
[27:01.000 --> 27:03.000]  topic for politicians,
[27:03.000 --> 27:05.000]  but it's crucial to face
[27:05.000 --> 27:07.000]  empowering women
[27:07.000 --> 27:09.000]  and educating everyone
[27:09.000 --> 27:11.000]  on the need to curb population growth
[27:11.000 --> 27:13.000]  seems a reasonable campaign to enact.
[27:13.000 --> 27:15.000]  Would you be courageous enough
[27:15.000 --> 27:17.000]  to discuss this issue
[27:17.000 --> 27:19.000]  and make it a key feature of a plan
[27:19.000 --> 27:21.000]  to address climate catastrophe?
[27:21.000 --> 27:23.000]  Well, Martha, the answer is yes.
[27:23.000 --> 27:25.000]  And the answer
[27:25.000 --> 27:27.000]  has everything to do with the fact
[27:27.000 --> 27:29.000]  that women in the United States
[27:29.000 --> 27:31.000]  of America, by the way,
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  have a right to control their own bodies
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  and make reproductive decisions.
[27:37.000 --> 27:39.000]  And the Mexico City Agreement,
[27:39.000 --> 27:41.000]  which denies American aid
[27:41.000 --> 27:43.000]  to those organizations around the world
[27:43.000 --> 27:45.000]  that allow
[27:45.000 --> 27:47.000]  women to have abortions
[27:47.000 --> 27:49.000]  or even get involved
[27:49.000 --> 27:51.000]  in birth control to me is totally absurd.
[27:51.000 --> 27:53.000]  So I think
[27:53.000 --> 27:55.000]  especially in poor countries around the world
[27:55.000 --> 27:57.000]  where women do not necessarily
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  want to have large numbers of babies
[27:59.000 --> 28:01.000]  and where they can
[28:01.000 --> 28:03.000]  have the opportunity through birth control
[28:03.000 --> 28:05.000]  to control the number of kids they have,
[28:05.000 --> 28:07.000]  something I very, very strongly support.
[28:07.000 --> 28:09.000]  Now, that sounds reasonable
[28:09.000 --> 28:11.000]  until you understand
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  they're pumping glyphosate and fluoride out
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  and wrote books decades ago
[28:15.000 --> 28:17.000]  admitting
[28:17.000 --> 28:19.000]  they're doing it to dumb us down
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  and reduce population
[28:21.000 --> 28:23.000]  and they're specifically targeting high IQ populations
[28:23.000 --> 28:25.000]  who they see as competition to them
[28:25.000 --> 28:27.000]  and then trying to balloon
[28:27.000 --> 28:29.000]  lower IQ populations.
[28:29.000 --> 28:31.000]  Andrew Yang isn't from communist China,
[28:31.000 --> 28:33.000]  but he might as well be.
[28:33.000 --> 28:35.000]  He hopes to shape our system to curb
[28:35.000 --> 28:37.000]  meat consumption.
[28:37.000 --> 28:39.000]  They're going to take everything away from you.
[28:39.000 --> 28:41.000]  They're going to track everything you do.
[28:41.000 --> 28:43.000]  That now vegans are suing neighbors
[28:43.000 --> 28:45.000]  that cook barbecue
[28:45.000 --> 28:47.000]  outside. It's all about
[28:47.000 --> 28:49.000]  a post-human world.
[28:49.000 --> 28:51.000]  All teaching you to hate yourselves.
[28:51.000 --> 28:53.000]  Stay with us. We're going to hit a key topic when we come back.
[28:53.000 --> 28:55.000]  And I really just lose a Sandy Hook lawsuit.
[28:55.000 --> 28:57.000]  No, I did.
[28:57.000 --> 28:59.000]  Wait till you hear this.
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.000]  If you're trying to quit drinking
[29:01.000 --> 29:03.000]  or doing too many drugs, listen to me.
[29:03.000 --> 29:05.000]  You don't know me and we'll never meet.
[29:05.000 --> 29:07.000]  I had a problem like you once.
[29:07.000 --> 29:09.000]  I drank and used to party a little too much
[29:09.000 --> 29:11.000]  till it got out of control
[29:11.000 --> 29:13.000]  and almost ruined my life.
[29:13.000 --> 29:15.000]  I realized I needed help
[29:15.000 --> 29:17.000]  to fix my problem before it
[29:17.000 --> 29:19.000]  totally destroyed me.
[29:19.000 --> 29:21.000]  If you've tried to fix your drinking and drug
[29:21.000 --> 29:23.000]  problem and you know you can't do it alone,
[29:23.000 --> 29:25.000]  you need to call the national
[29:25.000 --> 29:27.000]  treatment advisors.
[29:27.000 --> 29:29.000]  They'll immerse you into a 30-day

[33:29.000 --> 33:35.000]  www.infowars.com
[33:35.000 --> 33:37.000]  Ladies and gentlemen,
[33:37.000 --> 33:39.000]  Bernie Sanders came out
[33:39.000 --> 33:41.000]  in 70 worldwide population reduction
[33:41.000 --> 33:43.000]  particularly in brown
[33:43.000 --> 33:45.000]  people countries.
[33:45.000 --> 33:47.000]  Isn't that interesting? Yes.
[33:47.000 --> 33:49.000]  The Eugenesis, the left Margaret Sanger
[33:49.000 --> 33:51.000]  all funded by the
[33:51.000 --> 33:53.000]  Rockefellers, the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute
[33:53.000 --> 33:55.000]  funded by the Rockefellers
[33:55.000 --> 33:57.000]  who literally created
[33:57.000 --> 33:59.000]  the Nazi ideology.
[33:59.000 --> 34:01.000]  That's in mainline history books.
[34:01.000 --> 34:03.000]  www.naturalnews.com has an excellent article.
[34:03.000 --> 34:05.000]  We've posted it in full to
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  www.infowars.com so hit refresh.
[34:07.000 --> 34:09.000]  Bernie Sanders announces support
[34:09.000 --> 34:11.000]  for global eugenics
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  and depopulation calls on
[34:13.000 --> 34:15.000]  accelerating abortions in countries
[34:15.000 --> 34:17.000]  populated by people
[34:17.000 --> 34:19.000]  of color.
[34:19.000 --> 34:21.000]  And that's the Democratic Party
[34:21.000 --> 34:23.000]  that now Nazis
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.000]  are hiding under every single bed.
[34:25.000 --> 34:27.000]  Find out the truth,
[34:27.000 --> 34:29.000]  ladies and gentlemen.
[34:29.000 --> 34:31.000]  Coming up next hour
[34:31.000 --> 34:33.000]  we're going to have Tom Pappert
[34:33.000 --> 34:35.000]  a big league politics. He also runs
[34:35.000 --> 34:37.000]  some TV stations that carry our
[34:37.000 --> 34:39.000]  transmission, very smart talk show host.
[34:39.000 --> 34:41.000]  He dug into who's behind
[34:41.000 --> 34:43.000]  this move by Trump.
[34:43.000 --> 34:45.000]  Really it's by Ivanka, they're trying to sneak it past him
[34:45.000 --> 34:47.000]  to create digital red flag
[34:47.000 --> 34:49.000]  bureaucracies run by
[34:49.000 --> 34:51.000]  the National Institutes of Health
[34:51.000 --> 34:53.000]  in DARPA calling it HARPA
[34:53.000 --> 34:55.000]  where psychiatrists and big tech
[34:55.000 --> 34:57.000]  create an algorithm, a profile of you
[34:57.000 --> 34:59.000]  and then take your guns
[34:59.000 --> 35:01.000]  for these micro
[35:01.000 --> 35:03.000]  psychotic
[35:03.000 --> 35:05.000]  telltale signs they claim.
[35:05.000 --> 35:07.000]  That's just a bunch of
[35:07.000 --> 35:09.000]  phony propaganda.
[35:09.000 --> 35:11.000]  So we're going to be talking about that with Tom Pappert.
[35:11.000 --> 35:13.000]  Yes, this is really happening
[35:13.000 --> 35:15.000]  digital red flag laws and then Mike Adams
[35:15.000 --> 35:17.000]  is going to get into the eugenics.
[35:17.000 --> 35:19.000]  Roy Rick Ross is going to be in studio.
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.000]  He is the biggest busted cocaine dealer
[35:21.000 --> 35:23.000]  in US history and publicly
[35:23.000 --> 35:25.000]  worked for the central intelligence agency.
[35:25.000 --> 35:27.000]  Gary Webb of course was killed
[35:27.000 --> 35:29.000]  right before his new book was going to come out
[35:29.000 --> 35:31.000]  and vindicate all
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  of that. He'll be in studio
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  in the third hour today.
[35:35.000 --> 35:37.000]  Now, joining us
[35:37.000 --> 35:39.000]  is constitutional lawyer
[35:39.000 --> 35:41.000]  Robert Barnes
[35:41.000 --> 35:43.000]  and he's also a defense
[35:43.000 --> 35:45.000]  lawyer. He's also
[35:45.000 --> 35:47.000]  a civil rights lawyer
[35:47.000 --> 35:49.000]  and I wanted to get him on today.
[35:49.000 --> 35:51.000]  I know when listeners hear about Sandy Hook
[35:51.000 --> 35:53.000]  your eyes glaze over
[35:53.000 --> 35:55.000]  show to mind.
[35:55.000 --> 35:57.000]  But this latest escapade
[35:57.000 --> 35:59.000]  with Sandy Hook disinformation
[35:59.000 --> 36:01.000]  is illustrated of how the corporate media
[36:01.000 --> 36:03.000]  lies
[36:03.000 --> 36:05.000]  in mass towards a certain aim.
[36:05.000 --> 36:07.000]  So if I could show the viewers
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  a close shot of this please.
[36:09.000 --> 36:11.000]  Another twist in the Sandy Hook family's
[36:11.000 --> 36:13.000]  defamation case against Alex Jones.
[36:13.000 --> 36:15.000]  That's
[36:15.000 --> 36:17.000]  the Washington Post two months ago
[36:17.000 --> 36:19.000]  got no coverage.
[36:19.000 --> 36:21.000]  You have to specifically search the headline even find it.
[36:21.000 --> 36:23.000]  It's buried that there was a special
[36:23.000 --> 36:25.000]  interest case
[36:25.000 --> 36:27.000]  where the Supreme Court came in of Connecticut
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  took over the case before it ever even went to trial
[36:29.000 --> 36:31.000]  years
[36:31.000 --> 36:33.000]  before it was going to trial
[36:33.000 --> 36:35.000]  which is incredibly rare
[36:35.000 --> 36:37.000]  saying that there were anomalies
[36:37.000 --> 36:39.000]  to how I was being treated. Well, let Barnes
[36:39.000 --> 36:41.000]  as an expert on this describe how important this is.
[36:41.000 --> 36:43.000]  Notice you don't see
[36:43.000 --> 36:45.000]  how we're winning there and how they're trying to
[36:45.000 --> 36:47.000]  railroad us but it's so bad that even Supreme
[36:47.000 --> 36:49.000]  Courts are coming in not after the case
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  but before very rare.
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  But then look at this
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  Alex Jones seeks $100,000 for Sandy Hook families
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  but daily beefed.
[36:57.000 --> 36:59.000]  None of that's true. I waive attorney's fees
[36:59.000 --> 37:01.000]  but now they keep filing more and more suits
[37:01.000 --> 37:03.000]  on top of it for no reason so we're not
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  going to be able to do that. Alex Jones
[37:05.000 --> 37:07.000]  seeks $100,000 for Sandy Hook families. Totally not
[37:07.000 --> 37:09.000]  true. They're the ones stealing me. Father
[37:09.000 --> 37:11.000]  Sandy Hook victims wins defamation lawsuit
[37:11.000 --> 37:13.000]  against Alex Jones. The Associated Press
[37:13.000 --> 37:15.000]  it says I wrote a book
[37:15.000 --> 37:17.000]  with James Fetzer I've never read
[37:17.000 --> 37:19.000]  I'm not in the book
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  I mean I read it after I learned I supposedly wrote it
[37:21.000 --> 37:23.000]  I never lost a suit
[37:23.000 --> 37:25.000]  and everybody's running around saying I've
[37:25.000 --> 37:27.000]  lost because they know they're going to
[37:27.000 --> 37:29.000]  end up losing in the end but they don't care
[37:29.000 --> 37:31.000]  they want to declare I've lost to scare
[37:31.000 --> 37:33.000]  everyone. See it's
[37:33.000 --> 37:35.000]  all about perception
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  and so I've even seen talks to a host that I know
[37:37.000 --> 37:39.000]  I've seen a video yesterday just so
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  happy going I told you
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  he lost his appeal of his trial in Texas
[37:43.000 --> 37:45.000]  he's going bankrupt
[37:45.000 --> 37:47.000]  none of that
[37:47.000 --> 37:49.000]  was true I've not gone to trial on any of this
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  clearly it's been filed in Democrat
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  control areas to railroad me it's so obvious
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.000]  that the Supreme Court
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  of Connecticut got involved
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.000]  I mean this is amazing but it does
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  make me wonder what are they going to do next
[38:01.000 --> 38:03.000]  here's yesterday all over the newspapers
[38:03.000 --> 38:05.000]  in the paper locally today
[38:05.000 --> 38:07.000]  Jones loses Texas appeal
[38:07.000 --> 38:09.000]  an ongoing lawsuit with Sandy Hookfather
[38:09.000 --> 38:11.000]  didn't lose an appeal
[38:11.000 --> 38:13.000]  we'll explain that in a moment here's another one
[38:13.000 --> 38:15.000]  it's all over the New York Times
[38:15.000 --> 38:17.000]  everywhere Alex Jones loses
[38:17.000 --> 38:19.000]  Alex Jones loses I have to pay all cost
[38:19.000 --> 38:21.000]  they claim well then I read it all
[38:21.000 --> 38:23.000]  talked to lawyers yesterday
[38:23.000 --> 38:25.000]  and that wasn't the case so Robert Barnes
[38:25.000 --> 38:27.000]  joins us to again illustrate
[38:27.000 --> 38:29.000]  how if they can't actually
[38:29.000 --> 38:31.000]  assassinate my character and destroy us
[38:31.000 --> 38:33.000]  in the real world thanks to your support
[38:33.000 --> 38:35.000]  your prayers they'll just
[38:35.000 --> 38:37.000]  announce I'm dead like saying Mark Twain is dead when he's not
[38:37.000 --> 38:39.000]  to say oh look he's a loser
[38:39.000 --> 38:41.000]  we're winning they're losing
[38:41.000 --> 38:43.000]  America was never great you'll ever be that great
[38:43.000 --> 38:45.000]  Barnes you're the expert on why they're doing this
[38:45.000 --> 38:47.000]  we're going to counteract this next week we're not going to announce that yet
[38:47.000 --> 38:49.000]  but the suits will be filed next week
[38:49.000 --> 38:51.000]  as we're ready to announce that's
[38:51.000 --> 38:53.000]  happening just not the specifics till you're at studio next week
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  but you've got the floor of the segment next
[38:55.000 --> 38:57.000]  was I accurate in what I laid out there
[38:57.000 --> 38:59.000]  because you're the expert
[38:59.000 --> 39:01.000]  yeah no doubt about it I mean there were several different components
[39:01.000 --> 39:03.000]  that were mis-relayed in the press
[39:03.000 --> 39:05.000]  and that they knew that they were
[39:05.000 --> 39:07.000]  mis-relayed in the press
[39:07.000 --> 39:09.000]  by some partisan members of the press
[39:09.000 --> 39:11.000]  like Huffington Post and others
[39:11.000 --> 39:13.000]  and so for example what happened in the appeal
[39:13.000 --> 39:15.000]  case was the question was whether or not
[39:15.000 --> 39:17.000]  the appeal should be heard before
[39:17.000 --> 39:19.000]  the trial court hearing or after the trial court hearing
[39:19.000 --> 39:21.000]  due to some unique timeline
[39:21.000 --> 39:23.000]  issues under Texas law
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  if we did not file the appeal
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  then we could have waived our arguments for an appeal
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  so we had to
[39:29.000 --> 39:31.000]  raise it and what the appeals court said
[39:31.000 --> 39:33.000]  no we're going to send it back to the trial court
[39:33.000 --> 39:35.000]  let's have the trial court have the hearing first
[39:35.000 --> 39:37.000]  and then we'll have a hearing on the merits
[39:37.000 --> 39:39.000]  no merits decision has ever been
[39:39.000 --> 39:41.000]  issued by any appeals court in this
[39:41.000 --> 39:43.000]  matter so the relaying it
[39:43.000 --> 39:45.000]  as a lost appeal as if it was a lost appeal
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  on the merits and saying a bunch
[39:47.000 --> 39:49.000]  of costs were due that we're not going to be
[39:49.000 --> 39:51.000]  just appellate costs or very small
[39:51.000 --> 39:53.000]  costs that you pay so
[39:53.000 --> 39:55.000]  that was entirely misinterpreted
[39:55.000 --> 39:57.000]  and mis-relayed by the media
[39:57.000 --> 39:59.000]  and the press there was some discussion
[39:59.000 --> 40:01.000]  of discovery that was mis-relayed and misinterpreted
[40:01.000 --> 40:03.000]  by the press there's no question that
[40:03.000 --> 40:05.000]  the most significant development to date
[40:05.000 --> 40:07.000]  in the all of the Sandy Hook
[40:07.000 --> 40:09.000]  related cases was the Connecticut
[40:09.000 --> 40:11.000]  Supreme Court taking that extraordinary
[40:11.000 --> 40:13.000]  action to get involved
[40:13.000 --> 40:15.000]  and to intervene in the case and to say we really
[40:15.000 --> 40:17.000]  need to look at this and see what
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  and usually that's like a one in a 10,000
[40:19.000 --> 40:21.000]  proposition so all kinds of people
[40:21.000 --> 40:23.000]  request the Connecticut Supreme Court to get
[40:23.000 --> 40:25.000]  involved in cases prior to hearing
[40:25.000 --> 40:27.000]  prior to trial and it's because
[40:27.000 --> 40:29.000]  it relates to a new First Amendment
[40:29.000 --> 40:31.000]  issue all of the cases concerning
[40:31.000 --> 40:33.000]  the First Amendment whether the First Amendment
[40:33.000 --> 40:35.000]  has a safe space exception
[40:35.000 --> 40:37.000]  that allows people to sue someone
[40:37.000 --> 40:39.000]  if they feel emotionally upset
[40:39.000 --> 40:41.000]  by the nature of their speech even if
[40:41.000 --> 40:43.000]  no specifically false statement was made
[40:43.000 --> 40:45.000]  about them as an individual that's one of
[40:45.000 --> 40:47.000]  the critical issues that's paramount
[40:47.000 --> 40:49.000]  and pervades the Sandy Hook
[40:49.000 --> 40:51.000]  cases constitutionally but the
[40:51.000 --> 40:53.000]  one the Connecticut Supreme Court took up
[40:53.000 --> 40:55.000]  is whether or not a court
[40:55.000 --> 40:57.000]  can effectively
[40:57.000 --> 40:59.000]  censor or use its power
[40:59.000 --> 41:01.000]  in the judicial system
[41:01.000 --> 41:03.000]  to censor someone's out of courtroom
[41:03.000 --> 41:05.000]  speech because that's effectively
[41:05.000 --> 41:07.000]  what took place there and
[41:07.000 --> 41:09.000]  in fact the U.S. Supreme Court many
[41:09.000 --> 41:11.000]  decades ago said that that cannot
[41:11.000 --> 41:13.000]  happen a famous case out of California
[41:13.000 --> 41:15.000]  involving Harry Bridges in
[41:15.000 --> 41:17.000]  a labor union case where Bridges
[41:17.000 --> 41:19.000]  said a lot of very controversial things
[41:19.000 --> 41:21.000]  about the court hearing basically Bridges
[41:21.000 --> 41:23.000]  said he wasn't going to obey
[41:23.000 --> 41:25.000]  the labor union wasn't going to obey the injunction
[41:25.000 --> 41:27.000]  and a bunch of other conduct like that
[41:27.000 --> 41:29.000]  and the U.S. Supreme Court said that's
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  protected speech under the First
[41:31.000 --> 41:33.000]  Amendment and no court can issue contempt
[41:33.000 --> 41:35.000]  or any other form of sanction or discipline
[41:35.000 --> 41:37.000]  for someone's politically
[41:37.000 --> 41:39.000]  protected speech so I think all
[41:39.000 --> 41:41.000]  of these it's extraordinary that these cases
[41:41.000 --> 41:43.000]  the real legacy of these cases
[41:43.000 --> 41:45.000]  despite the political attempt to use
[41:45.000 --> 41:47.000]  them to tar and feather your reputation
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  to try to de-platform you to try
[41:49.000 --> 41:51.000]  to scare off audiences from supporting
[41:51.000 --> 41:53.000]  you that's their political objective
[41:53.000 --> 41:55.000]  of the press
[41:55.000 --> 41:57.000]  and some of the politicians that
[41:57.000 --> 41:59.000]  have propagated the case
[41:59.000 --> 42:01.000]  but the law the lasting legal
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  legacy of this case will be the protection
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  of the First Amendment and what it means
[42:05.000 --> 42:07.000]  for the free press and free speech
[42:07.000 --> 42:09.000]  as I told CNN yesterday
[42:09.000 --> 42:11.000]  the key issue in this case is whether
[42:11.000 --> 42:13.000]  press and speech will remain
[42:13.000 --> 42:15.000]  free in the United States because
[42:15.000 --> 42:17.000]  if some of the legal theories being pursued
[42:17.000 --> 42:19.000]  are permitted
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  or allowed then press will no longer
[42:21.000 --> 42:23.000]  be free and speech will no longer be free
[42:23.000 --> 42:25.000]  in the United States so these cases will
[42:25.000 --> 42:27.000]  establish the true scope of the First
[42:27.000 --> 42:29.000]  Amendment and will probably be the most seminal
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  foundational fundamental First
[42:31.000 --> 42:33.000]  Amendment cases in the country for decades
[42:33.000 --> 42:35.000]  to come and by the way you're not
[42:35.000 --> 42:37.000]  just saying that the Washington Post
[42:37.000 --> 42:39.000]  the New York Times, Rolling Stone
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  they all say we're ending the First
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  Amendment using Jones we don't need
[42:43.000 --> 42:45.000]  it anymore it's bad that they're not even
[42:45.000 --> 42:47.000]  denying that they're ending free speech
[42:47.000 --> 42:49.000]  in America and trying to use a strawman
[42:49.000 --> 42:51.000]  they built to me I want to give this to some other
[42:51.000 --> 42:53.000]  big geopolitical issues get your take on some things
[42:53.000 --> 42:55.000]  I want to briefly get back to AP

[44:55.000 --> 44:57.000]  supplements and t-shirts

[44:59.000 --> 45:01.000]  and things you need
[45:01.000 --> 45:03.000]  and that's why we're introducing
[45:03.000 --> 45:05.000]  what we know is going to be a massive bestseller
[45:05.000 --> 45:07.000]  Chillforce
[45:07.000 --> 45:09.000]  now let's look at what's in this powerful formula
[45:09.000 --> 45:11.000]  Ashwagandha root extract
[45:11.000 --> 45:13.000]  an ancient medicinal herb
[45:13.000 --> 45:15.000]  used for over 3000 years to treat stress
[45:15.000 --> 45:17.000]  and relax the patient
[45:17.000 --> 45:19.000]  with a low amino acid
[45:19.000 --> 45:21.000]  naturally found in some tea leaves
[45:21.000 --> 45:23.000]  the compound has been called the stress killer
[45:23.000 --> 45:25.000]  because of its powerful relaxation benefits
[45:25.000 --> 45:27.000]  GABA
[45:27.000 --> 45:29.000]  an important neurotransmitter
[45:29.000 --> 45:31.000]  that controls functions of the body and mind
[45:31.000 --> 45:33.000]  including nervous system relaxation
[45:33.000 --> 45:35.000]  GABA is a choice for many
[45:35.000 --> 45:37.000]  to help reduce anxiety
[45:37.000 --> 45:39.000]  rhodiola rosea root extract
[45:39.000 --> 45:41.000]  found in the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia
[45:41.000 --> 45:43.000]  this root is considered a super adaptogen
[45:43.000 --> 45:45.000]  and is believed to help the body
[45:45.000 --> 45:47.000]  heal and physical stress
[45:47.000 --> 45:49.000]  it's time to do what I did

[46:15.000 --> 46:17.000]  well now we teamed up with them
[46:17.000 --> 46:19.000]  and came out with two different types of skin cream
[46:19.000 --> 46:21.000]  one is naturally sent in
[46:21.000 --> 46:23.000]  with grapefruit essential oils
[46:23.000 --> 46:25.000]  the other is unscented
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  it's got hyaluronic acid
[46:27.000 --> 46:29.000]  vitamin E
[46:29.000 --> 46:31.000]  essential oils from grapefruit
[46:31.000 --> 46:33.000]  it's got coconut oil

[47:29.000 --> 47:31.000]  who's done the research
[47:31.000 --> 47:33.000]  we're going to be getting into
[47:33.000 --> 47:35.000]  the Obama operatives
[47:35.000 --> 47:37.000]  inside this
[47:37.000 --> 47:39.000]  DARPA slash
[47:39.000 --> 47:41.000]  DARPA system they're setting up
[47:41.000 --> 47:43.000]  where the medical tyranny
[47:43.000 --> 47:45.000]  is dialed into all your tech
[47:45.000 --> 47:47.000]  all the audio, all the video from your smart devices
[47:47.000 --> 47:49.000]  that are listening to you
[47:49.000 --> 47:51.000]  it's not even bombshell anymore
[47:51.000 --> 47:53.000]  it's like, yeah, they're listening to us
[47:53.000 --> 47:55.000]  and yeah, you don't know what to hide
[47:55.000 --> 47:57.000]  it doesn't matter, they're going to make stuff up
[47:57.000 --> 47:59.000]  it's a tyranny
[47:59.000 --> 48:01.000]  they're the bad guys
[48:01.000 --> 48:03.000]  we're going to get constitutional lawyer Robert Barnes
[48:03.000 --> 48:05.000]  take on that in a moment
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  during the break we were talking
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  he wants to chime in on Bernie Sanders
[48:09.000 --> 48:11.000]  and the Eugenicist at Planned Parenthood
[48:11.000 --> 48:13.000]  but first, this headline out of AP
[48:13.000 --> 48:15.000]  we are filing some suits next week
[48:15.000 --> 48:17.000]  we're not going to announce those quite yet
[48:17.000 --> 48:19.000]  I can tell you AP is in the running
[48:19.000 --> 48:21.000]  we still have, we've got sister 7 on the table
[48:21.000 --> 48:23.000]  written up, we're just last minute
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  going to be talking the next few days
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  about what we're going to do
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  Bob's going to get here, he'll be here Monday
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.000]  and we're going to make those decisions in the next few days
[48:31.000 --> 48:33.000]  by the middle of next week
[48:33.000 --> 48:35.000]  saying I lost a lawsuit
[48:35.000 --> 48:37.000]  for saying nobody died, even though that's free speech
[48:37.000 --> 48:39.000]  for a book I wrote
[48:39.000 --> 48:41.000]  called Nobody Died at Sandy Hook
[48:41.000 --> 48:43.000]  that my name's not on
[48:43.000 --> 48:45.000]  that a professor wrote
[48:45.000 --> 48:47.000]  and
[48:47.000 --> 48:49.000]  the article's not even about me, but they stand by it
[48:51.000 --> 48:53.000]  it has a publishing number
[48:53.000 --> 48:55.000]  I'm not in the book, I'm not on the book
[48:55.000 --> 48:57.000]  and they just laughed at Barnes when he's called them
[48:57.000 --> 48:59.000]  he's written them letters
[48:59.000 --> 49:01.000]  the Wall Street Journal, republished it
[49:01.000 --> 49:03.000]  and people walk by me and say
[49:03.000 --> 49:05.000]  aha, you lost, it's creating
[49:05.000 --> 49:07.000]  like a self-fulfilling prophecy they think
[49:07.000 --> 49:09.000]  for juries in the future
[49:09.000 --> 49:11.000]  I'm trying to figure out exactly what this is, but here it is
[49:11.000 --> 49:13.000]  father of Sandy Hook
[49:13.000 --> 49:15.000]  victim wins defamation lawsuit against
[49:15.000 --> 49:17.000]  Alex Jones
[49:17.000 --> 49:19.000]  and
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  it hurt my feelings, I got sent a clip last night
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  of a talk show host I helped years ago, nothing but nice to
[49:23.000 --> 49:25.000]  we're just in sublime
[49:25.000 --> 49:27.000]  pleasure going
[49:27.000 --> 49:29.000]  Jones lost his appeal, Jones lost this
[49:29.000 --> 49:31.000]  he's going under
[49:31.000 --> 49:33.000]  and
[49:33.000 --> 49:35.000]  these are even conservatives
[49:35.000 --> 49:37.000]  I guess get brownie points with youtube doing this
[49:37.000 --> 49:39.000]  but it's so sick
[49:39.000 --> 49:41.000]  and it's not even true, Robert
[49:41.000 --> 49:43.000]  so what's the psychology behind this
[49:43.000 --> 49:45.000]  I think the press is so used
[49:45.000 --> 49:47.000]  to lying and libeling about you
[49:47.000 --> 49:49.000]  that they just do it routinely
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  and regularly, I mean they just sort of went nuts
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  with it this summer
[49:53.000 --> 49:55.000]  with a wide range of lies and libels
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  by everybody from the Young Turks, New York Times
[49:57.000 --> 49:59.000]  prominent
[49:59.000 --> 50:01.000]  individuals, the Associated Press
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  market watch, so you had a wide
[50:03.000 --> 50:05.000]  range of individuals and institutions
[50:05.000 --> 50:07.000]  who were so accustomed to getting away
[50:07.000 --> 50:09.000]  with lying and libeling
[50:09.000 --> 50:11.000]  people on the political right, and particularly
[50:11.000 --> 50:13.000]  you and President Trump
[50:13.000 --> 50:15.000]  probably more than so than anybody
[50:15.000 --> 50:17.000]  the combination of the two of you
[50:17.000 --> 50:19.000]  have been the targets of more lies and libels and almost
[50:19.000 --> 50:21.000]  anybody, fake news stories
[50:21.000 --> 50:23.000]  that they don't think there's going to be any consequence to it
[50:23.000 --> 50:25.000]  I mean that was part of the reason that
[50:25.000 --> 50:27.000]  the Free America Law Center in order to support
[50:27.000 --> 50:29.000]  these kind of cases brought the Covington
[50:29.000 --> 50:31.000]  cases because even though they may be
[50:31.000 --> 50:33.000]  difficult cases in certain contexts
[50:33.000 --> 50:35.000]  there needed to be at least an
[50:35.000 --> 50:37.000]  effort at meaningful remedy
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  and so what you're seeing is, I mean there was
[50:39.000 --> 50:41.000]  the white shoe boy
[50:41.000 --> 50:43.000]  that they deliberately misconstrued
[50:43.000 --> 50:45.000]  as Jew boy, there was a
[50:45.000 --> 50:47.000]  false statements about
[50:47.000 --> 50:49.000]  that you set things, set child porn
[50:49.000 --> 50:51.000]  at Sandy Hook families that it's completely false
[50:51.000 --> 50:53.000]  so there was a wide range of lies
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  and libels that even people that are
[50:55.000 --> 50:57.000]  critics on social media and other places were
[50:57.000 --> 50:59.000]  shocked by the scale and the
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  scope of the lies and libels
[51:01.000 --> 51:03.000]  and my point at the time was this should
[51:03.000 --> 51:05.000]  raise questions for everybody
[51:05.000 --> 51:07.000]  about what else has been said
[51:07.000 --> 51:09.000]  that's a lie and a libel because there have been a lot
[51:09.000 --> 51:11.000]  of false statements out there about
[51:11.000 --> 51:13.000]  you probably more so than any other member
[51:13.000 --> 51:15.000]  of the press in the country or in the
[51:15.000 --> 51:17.000]  world really and that's because they
[51:17.000 --> 51:19.000]  feel threatened by the success of info wars
[51:19.000 --> 51:21.000]  the ability of the audience to stay
[51:21.000 --> 51:23.000]  committed to info wars
[51:23.000 --> 51:25.000]  to continue to support info wars
[51:25.000 --> 51:27.000]  I think that was something they thought never would happen
[51:27.000 --> 51:29.000]  so they just kept escalating the lies
[51:29.000 --> 51:31.000]  they hate the activist bulldog
[51:31.000 --> 51:33.000]  audience and I'm not kissing the audiences
[51:33.000 --> 51:35.000]  but folks you guys deserve
[51:35.000 --> 51:37.000]  the congressional medal of honor in the information war
[51:37.000 --> 51:39.000]  not me, you're the ones that have literally done it
[51:39.000 --> 51:41.000]  all with our supporters this great crew
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.000]  so let me ask you this Robert
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  why do you think
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  they got in the position
[51:47.000 --> 51:49.000]  to lie this crazily
[51:49.000 --> 51:51.000]  and to do these things because
[51:51.000 --> 51:53.000]  all it's doing at many levels
[51:53.000 --> 51:55.000]  and it's hurt us in some ways
[51:55.000 --> 51:57.000]  it has caused damage but it damages them
[51:57.000 --> 51:59.000]  as well along the way
[51:59.000 --> 52:01.000]  they're willing to risk their own
[52:01.000 --> 52:03.000]  reputation it's sort of a
[52:03.000 --> 52:05.000]  different variation of what they did against president trump
[52:05.000 --> 52:07.000]  they're willing to completely destroy
[52:07.000 --> 52:09.000]  and wreck their own reputations
[52:09.000 --> 52:11.000]  as a desperate effort
[52:11.000 --> 52:13.000]  to destroy an individual
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.000]  that they consider the biggest
[52:15.000 --> 52:17.000]  threat to their control of the established narrative
[52:17.000 --> 52:19.000]  and they've been the gatekeepers
[52:19.000 --> 52:21.000]  of established narrative for so long
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  for really a century or so
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  at least a half a century
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  since the 1950s
[52:27.000 --> 52:29.000]  they've been able to control what people hear
[52:29.000 --> 52:31.000]  and by doing so control what people think
[52:31.000 --> 52:33.000]  and what people feel permitted to say
[52:33.000 --> 52:35.000]  and so they've been
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  shocked that someone like president trump
[52:37.000 --> 52:39.000]  could succeed shocked that the
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  info wars audience could make
[52:41.000 --> 52:43.000]  president trump a real possibility
[52:43.000 --> 52:45.000]  and shocked by the power
[52:45.000 --> 52:47.000]  that info wars audience was able to fuel
[52:47.000 --> 52:49.000]  the most independent press
[52:49.000 --> 52:51.000]  network in the world of this scale
[52:51.000 --> 52:53.000]  and scope and so they
[52:53.000 --> 52:55.000]  it's like anybody that's in
[52:55.000 --> 52:57.000]  trouble they reach to desperate
[52:57.000 --> 52:59.000]  measures even ones that risk
[52:59.000 --> 53:01.000]  their own reputations
[53:01.000 --> 53:03.000]  to do so and that's really who they are
[53:03.000 --> 53:05.000]  and what they're about
[53:05.000 --> 53:07.000]  let's bring this up also have gotten the calls
[53:07.000 --> 53:09.000]  and people going oh your lawyer barns
[53:09.000 --> 53:11.000]  he the covington case got thrown out
[53:11.000 --> 53:13.000]  no you when that got filed
[53:13.000 --> 53:15.000]  said watch this 500 million is going to get thrown out
[53:15.000 --> 53:17.000]  I'm going to wait and see how the
[53:17.000 --> 53:19.000]  courts respond I've got a year and then
[53:19.000 --> 53:21.000]  I'm going to file them what you're obviously about to do
[53:21.000 --> 53:23.000]  and actually probably when
[53:23.000 --> 53:25.000]  you what got like an 89%
[53:25.000 --> 53:27.000]  win rate or settlement rate I mean you really are
[53:27.000 --> 53:29.000]  one of the ace lawyers out there out of millions
[53:29.000 --> 53:31.000]  and millions of lawyers it's just a fact
[53:31.000 --> 53:33.000]  and that's why so many
[53:33.000 --> 53:35.000]  democrats and operatives want you out of the cases
[53:35.000 --> 53:37.000]  where you represent us they just go
[53:37.000 --> 53:39.000]  crazy and the way you've called all
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  my cases and the way you predicted
[53:41.000 --> 53:43.000]  what was going to happen or how the Texas Supreme Court
[53:43.000 --> 53:45.000]  just ruled so that we can open
[53:45.000 --> 53:47.000]  open up our operations next week
[53:47.000 --> 53:49.000]  I mean you've you've you've really been uncannily
[53:49.000 --> 53:51.000]  able to predict all this so you might want to
[53:51.000 --> 53:53.000]  set the record straight your covington
[53:53.000 --> 53:55.000]  cases have not yet been filed and have not
[53:55.000 --> 53:57.000]  been thrown out
[53:57.000 --> 53:59.000]  they have not been thrown out at all
[53:59.000 --> 54:01.000]  they we did file them at the beginning
[54:01.000 --> 54:03.000]  of August so we sued everybody
[54:03.000 --> 54:05.000]  including senator Elizabeth Warren
[54:05.000 --> 54:07.000]  I was thinking you got more coming too so sorry I miss
[54:07.000 --> 54:09.000]  misspoke oh yeah no problem
[54:09.000 --> 54:11.000]  see in fact what was interesting was senator
[54:11.000 --> 54:13.000]  Warren's response so she tried to
[54:13.000 --> 54:15.000]  drag the whole case into federal court
[54:15.000 --> 54:17.000]  and her argument is that once she's elected
[54:17.000 --> 54:19.000]  to once anyone is elected to congress
[54:19.000 --> 54:21.000]  they have a license to lie
[54:21.000 --> 54:23.000]  and libel anyone in the world
[54:23.000 --> 54:25.000]  even if it has nothing to do with their
[54:25.000 --> 54:27.000]  client immunity exactly
[54:27.000 --> 54:29.000]  she claimed an immunity that has never been
[54:29.000 --> 54:31.000]  granted to any elected politician
[54:31.000 --> 54:33.000]  don't they only have it on the floor
[54:33.000 --> 54:35.000]  don't they only have a quasi immunity on the floor
[54:35.000 --> 54:37.000]  exactly what you have is you have a the speech
[54:37.000 --> 54:39.000]  of the US constitution and there's a
[54:39.000 --> 54:41.000]  statutory version of that
[54:41.000 --> 54:43.000]  which has only ever been applied
[54:43.000 --> 54:45.000]  to either statements made on the floor
[54:45.000 --> 54:47.000]  which by the way there are specific rules
[54:47.000 --> 54:49.000]  that govern what you can say on the floor
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  that's why those rules exist is to
[54:51.000 --> 54:53.000]  prevent them from using the floor
[54:53.000 --> 54:55.000]  their internal rules from using the floor
[54:55.000 --> 54:57.000]  that's why not allowed to disparage or defame
[54:57.000 --> 54:59.000]  because you're violating the immunity
[54:59.000 --> 55:01.000]  exactly you're violating the internal rules
[55:01.000 --> 55:03.000]  of the house and the senate so you don't abuse
[55:03.000 --> 55:05.000]  the speech and immunities clause protection
[55:05.000 --> 55:07.000]  the other place that's been extended to is
[55:07.000 --> 55:09.000]  press conferences and things like that
[55:09.000 --> 55:11.000]  about what happened before the committee
[55:11.000 --> 55:13.000]  so the so it but in every other
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  context congressmen and senators
[55:15.000 --> 55:17.000]  have been held liable and responsible
[55:17.000 --> 55:19.000]  when they went out and lied and libeled about
[55:19.000 --> 55:21.000]  trying to open up an imperial form of
[55:21.000 --> 55:23.000]  immunity absolutely
[55:23.000 --> 55:25.000]  one that would basically say hey if you're
[55:25.000 --> 55:27.000]  liberal get elected to the senate it would be like
[55:27.000 --> 55:29.000]  this and say oh now I got elected to the house
[55:29.000 --> 55:31.000]  or I get elected to the senate now because
[55:31.000 --> 55:33.000]  I'm another senator I can lie about my ex wife
[55:33.000 --> 55:35.000]  I can lie about my neighbor down the street
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  I can lie about my I can say I can
[55:37.000 --> 55:39.000]  call my neighbor a murderer
[55:39.000 --> 55:41.000]  I can lie on my taxes
[55:41.000 --> 55:43.000]  I can just lie across the board
[55:43.000 --> 55:45.000]  destroy people's reputations because somehow
[55:45.000 --> 55:47.000]  that's a privilege of an elected politician
[55:47.000 --> 55:49.000]  and it's not they have to do it within
[55:49.000 --> 55:51.000]  their official duties as an
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  official representative of the government
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  then they're given immunity to protect the
[55:55.000 --> 55:57.000]  scope of their speech but that is not
[55:57.000 --> 55:59.000]  a green light to lie and libel
[55:59.000 --> 56:01.000]  a bunch of kids from Covington, Kentucky
[56:01.000 --> 56:03.000]  that had nothing to do with the senator
[56:03.000 --> 56:04.000]  from Massachusetts.
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  All right Robert we gotta go to break I want to come back
[56:06.000 --> 56:08.000]  and get into Bernie Sanders and his
[56:08.000 --> 56:10.000]  abort brown people statement he actually
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  said that we played it earlier that's
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  coming up and then we've got Tom
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  Pappard in studio yes

[59:38.000 --> 59:40.000]  America and the world
[59:40.000 --> 59:42.000]  we're building it to be a place where
[59:42.000 --> 59:46.000]  we can have a home it's called band.video
[59:46.000 --> 59:48.000]  America and the world is fighting back against tyranny

[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:18.000]  America and the world is fighting back against tyranny
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:28.000]  at band.video
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  America and the world is fighting back against tyranny
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:45.000]  pioneering of privateguitar
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000]  gang and others.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  Well, my first experience with that was as a scholarship student at Yale, I along with
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.480]  Justice Breyer's daughter and some other people formed a debate society and one of the debate
[01:00:55.480 --> 01:00:58.080]  issues was about Planned Parenthood.
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:01.600]  So we had some of the higher ranking people from Planned Parenthood there and part of
[01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:05.840]  it was they did a speaking presentation for 45 minutes and then there was a dinner afterwards
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:10.880]  with professors, academics and students and I was seated next to the main Planned Parenthood
[01:01:10.880 --> 01:01:15.360]  individual and early on in the conversation, he turned to me and said, well, you understand
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:20.560]  the importance of this, have you looked at where the population is expanding and I remember
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:25.120]  being shocked at multiple levels, one of the moral horror of such a comment and what he
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:30.260]  means and intended, but what was even worse was that he expected and anticipated that
[01:01:30.260 --> 01:01:34.640]  just because I was a student at Yale, not knowing my background, that I would be completely
[01:01:34.640 --> 01:01:38.880]  acceptable to this notion that he could just broach it at a dinner conversation with someone
[01:01:38.880 --> 01:01:43.160]  he had just met that evening to say, hey, you know, our real objective, our real goal
[01:01:43.160 --> 01:01:49.040]  here is to control populations in poor countries, particularly minority populations.
[01:01:49.040 --> 01:01:53.560]  So it's an incredible admission by Bernie to immediately jump to that.
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:57.960]  I mean, he could have said a lot of things about population control that were different
[01:01:57.960 --> 01:01:58.960]  than what he said.
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:03.280]  Instead, it was let's use government money and pay people around the world to make sure
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:07.680]  they abort their babies, particularly in those countries with big population issues,
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:12.480]  which are overwhelmingly the countries that are being targeted are African countries and
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:15.560]  countries of brown and black people in Latin America and Africa.
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:19.680]  So it's a horrendous if Trump had said that would have been news for a year.
[01:02:19.680 --> 01:02:25.320]  So the extraordinary degree to which the purported Democratic candidate for the presidency is
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:30.760]  endorsing a eugenics agenda that would support that would have government funding and government
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:36.640]  coercion behind it to people all around the world, we're not even part of the United States,
[01:02:36.640 --> 01:02:40.920]  is a frightening and terrifying prospect of the ideas that are coming back to the fore
[01:02:40.920 --> 01:02:41.920]  again.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:45.800]  You know, I was going to air this gun control boil down intro.
[01:02:45.800 --> 01:02:46.800]  We come back.
[01:02:46.800 --> 01:02:49.760]  So we have time to get Tom Pappert seated in here, but there's only a 60 second break
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:52.280]  when we go to break here in a few minutes.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:56.240]  I want you to hold over as I got to go soon, but I want you to have the floor for like
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:03:00.120]  five minutes when we come back to specifically speak to that was what was one of the top
[01:03:00.120 --> 01:03:04.120]  stories on the on the web yesterday, thanks to Drudge Report making up the top story for
[01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:08.920]  10 hours on the site again, we had over a million plus original visitors just to info
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:13.320]  or just off that link, which is so refreshing because I'm not against Trump, but I'm not
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:16.920]  even against Ivanka and Jared, but they go to dinner with big tech, they're hanging out
[01:03:16.920 --> 01:03:17.920]  with them.
[01:03:17.920 --> 01:03:22.560]  This proposal, we're going to expose next segment that Obama was actually pushing that
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:27.120]  they tried to get Trump to do before to have the National Institutes of Health and the
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:31.120]  CDC hooked in with DARPA, the thing called Harpa.
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:37.040]  And they're going to be in your smart devices watching you, listening to you, they admit
[01:03:37.040 --> 01:03:41.440]  so the coming out of, hey, these personal assistants and iPhones and Apple Watches are
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:44.960]  watching and listening to you, just amazing that that's now on the open.
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:50.840]  And then the idea that extra judicially, they're calling them, you know, these psycho signs
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:54.960]  that aren't even overt calls for violence, but high blood pressure, anger in your voice
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:59.320]  and that it's a psychological credit score is what it is.
[01:03:59.320 --> 01:04:03.520]  And then your guns will be taken outside of law.
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:04.920]  This will trigger a civil war.
[01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:08.320]  And I'm not the one saying that I'm surprised that I saw the video this morning.
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:12.480]  Somebody sent to me, Glenn Beck was covering yesterday saying this will cause a civil war.
[01:04:12.480 --> 01:04:14.980]  These red flags and computerized red flags.
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:16.720]  So I mean, this is crazy.
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:20.520]  So your constitutional lawyer, when we come back, Robert Barnes to talk about it, but
[01:04:20.520 --> 01:04:23.600]  briefly, you're going to be here next week, we're talking more about this legal foundation
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:27.880]  you've launched, what the ACLU should be doing, and you already filed suits, not the
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:30.760]  ones that got thrown out the new ones for the Covington kids.
[01:04:30.760 --> 01:04:33.800]  So what's the best website for people to visit that and find out more?
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:41.320]  Sure, they can go to www.FreeAmericaLawCenter.com, FreeAmericaLawCenter.com, and we set it up

[01:06:07.800 --> 01:06:13.480]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:18.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:06:18.840 --> 01:06:26.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there is a global architecture being established to have big tech merge with
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:35.480]  governments with old media as the thought police soldiers in the street censoring and
[01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:40.200]  controlling and monitoring everything you say and do, and then if you don't play ball,
[01:06:40.200 --> 01:06:43.200]  you can't leave your house, you can't get on a bus, you can't buy a car, you can't
[01:06:43.200 --> 01:06:46.280]  have a job, you can't get on a train or an airplane.
[01:06:46.280 --> 01:06:47.280]  That's coming here.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:52.240]  They've already announced it, global cashless society run by Facebook.
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:58.600]  Facebook says, what words you can say, what words you can, we're leaping into tyranny.
[01:06:58.600 --> 01:07:01.680]  There's a revolution against human rights and freedoms.
[01:07:01.680 --> 01:07:03.640]  We're told it's a post-human world.
[01:07:03.640 --> 01:07:07.760]  Now, I said that if Trump openly supports this, as the Washington Post says he's going
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:12.640]  to, that I will call for his impeachment, because there's no lesser of two evils when
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.640]  you do this.
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:18.160]  The Washington Post lies a lot, so I researched it and I found out Trump is best buddies with
[01:07:18.160 --> 01:07:22.040]  the man proposing this, and the people that actually have already set up this division
[01:07:22.040 --> 01:07:27.880]  of DARPA that they now want to get fully funded are Obama and Hillary minions, and it's the
[01:07:27.880 --> 01:07:32.200]  medicalization of everything, just like the Soviet Union or Nazi Germany, first-use psychologists
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:37.800]  and psychiatrists to carry out the first euthanasia, the first exterminations.
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:44.120]  And so it's a red flag law with no law carried out by a bureaucracy and a giant power grab,
[01:07:44.120 --> 01:07:46.840]  and forced inoculations, and forced drugging.
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:50.280]  This is how classical tyranny is unfolded, now it has a high-tech overlay, so the story
[01:07:50.280 --> 01:07:52.120]  went viral.
[01:07:52.120 --> 01:07:57.000]  Trump administration considering social credit score system to determine who can buy a gun.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:59.560]  Daily Caller reported on it, our same analysis.
[01:07:59.560 --> 01:08:03.760]  Cowell's others did, but a lot of people couldn't believe this.
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:08.080]  Tom Pappert, talk show host researcher, he has looked into the roots of it and found even
[01:08:08.080 --> 01:08:09.080]  more shocking info.
[01:08:09.080 --> 01:08:12.600]  He'll be in studio just a few minutes, but constitutional lawyer, and of course Chief
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:19.280]  Counsel for InfoWars, Robert Barnes, your take on this, just from the judicial perspective
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:26.480]  of saying this consortium of big tech and government, a merger of the NSA and big tech,
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:31.000]  which already happened, really a coming out of it, how would you describe this nightmare
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  scenario?
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:36.240]  Well, there's no question that for a long time it has been suspected, and there's a
[01:08:36.240 --> 01:08:40.440]  wide range of evidence for it from various sources, that the reason why big tech got
[01:08:40.440 --> 01:08:45.760]  support and subsidies and various forms of protection from government was for the purposes
[01:08:45.760 --> 01:08:50.560]  of this kind of surveillance operation, this kind of spying, and this kind of censorship,
[01:08:50.560 --> 01:08:52.080]  this kind of control.
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:56.560]  It's most evident in the Chinese social credit model system that they've announced and are
[01:08:56.560 --> 01:09:00.600]  utilizing, but there's no question that it was intended for Europe, the United States
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:02.040]  and other countries as well.
[01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:03.560]  It's extraordinary power.
[01:09:03.560 --> 01:09:07.760]  It was supposed to be powered to the ordinary person to be able to get their voice heard
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:12.920]  across a broader platform, but in fact, it was always used and intended by some aspects
[01:09:12.920 --> 01:09:17.880]  of the government and big tech to be able to control, censor, shame, and surveil people
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:20.240]  often without their notice or knowledge.
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:23.960]  There's no question that the red flag laws have been almost all precarious.
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:27.360]  So there are ways to do a constitutional red flag law.
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:33.400]  You limit it to solely to the same standard you would have for involuntary institutionalization
[01:09:33.400 --> 01:09:34.600]  of someone who's mentally ill.
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:37.760]  It's a very high standard, clear and convincing evidence of proof.
[01:09:37.760 --> 01:09:39.600]  You have a full right to a hearing.
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:43.080]  You have a full right to evidence, a full right to presentation.
[01:09:43.080 --> 01:09:48.120]  Because they know that would all be rarely used against only the worst potential risks.
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:53.960]  Any other red flag law invites this kind of big tech, big government collusion to surveil,
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:59.160]  spy on, censor, and control people's behavior, and it really runs afoul that the idea that's
[01:09:59.160 --> 01:10:04.320]  being proposed to the president, that is being proposed by various political, purported allies,
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:08.680]  but are really adversaries of the president, is an idea that would offend the First Amendment,
[01:10:08.680 --> 01:10:12.520]  the Second Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment, and not just the
[01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:15.800]  Second Amendment because it would infringe on First Amendment rights because it would
[01:10:15.800 --> 01:10:17.640]  effectively punish speech.
[01:10:17.640 --> 01:10:21.920]  It would also clearly and evidently infringe on Second Amendment rights, the right to bear
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:26.920]  arms as necessary to protect all other rights, including the right of self-defense, including
[01:10:26.920 --> 01:10:32.280]  the right of self-defense against potential government incorrect behavior, bad behavior,
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:33.920]  but also importantly, the Fourth Amendment.
[01:10:33.920 --> 01:10:38.880]  The Fourth Amendment basically enshrines a right to privacy, a right against the government
[01:10:38.880 --> 01:10:43.200]  in particular, intruding and invading that privacy, and the Fifth Amendment guarantees
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:44.840]  the right to due process.
[01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:48.360]  And of course, the Sixth Amendment guarantees the right to a jury trial about any significant
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:50.080]  issue of property or liberty.
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:53.640]  So when you end with the Seventh Amendment, Sixth Amendment, right to counsel, Seventh
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:55.200]  Amendment, right to a jury trial.
[01:10:55.200 --> 01:10:59.080]  So you look at it, all of those rights are being violated by this proposed law.
[01:10:59.080 --> 01:11:03.280]  This proposed law would punish people for their speech, deprive people of the right
[01:11:03.280 --> 01:11:06.840]  of self-defense under the Second Amendment, would invade their privacy under the Fourth
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:11.000]  Amendment without probable cause of any criminal behavior, would deny them their due process
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.600]  under the Fifth Amendment, deprive them of access to a counsel by the way the proceedings
[01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:17.960]  work under the Sixth Amendment, and deprive them of their jury trial rights under the
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:18.960]  Seventh Amendment.
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:23.240]  It would be the most constitutionally offensive proposal in this context in the history of
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:24.240]  the country.
[01:11:24.240 --> 01:11:28.440]  We should not be using the Chinese social credit model system for anything in the United
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:29.440]  States.
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:32.280]  We should be resisting it at every single level.
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:36.760]  And this proposal goes right to the core of those fundamental freedoms, including and
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:42.400]  using the right of self-defense as the proxy to do it, because all these various gun control
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:45.880]  advocates keep saying they want to control guns, but that's not really true.
[01:11:45.880 --> 01:11:49.520]  They want the guns to be monopolized by the government and criminals.
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:54.960]  They don't want ordinary, everyday law-abiding individuals to be able to defend themselves.
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:12:00.520]  Almost every sophisticated survey and study, including by a former high-ranking NPR executive,
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:05.200]  including by a member of 538, the very liberal data site, both of them came out and said,
[01:12:05.200 --> 01:12:09.480]  we studied the data, and there's no doubts whatsoever that gun control would lead to
[01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:15.680]  more deaths, not fewer, because the gun self-defense is used so often in this country.
[01:12:15.680 --> 01:12:18.880]  In many self-defense cases, they're not even tracked or traced.
[01:12:18.880 --> 01:12:19.880]  We only know about it.
[01:12:19.880 --> 01:12:25.920]  The numbers I've seen is 24 to 50-plus times it's used to stop crime or save someone versus
[01:12:25.920 --> 01:12:30.360]  it being used in a crime, but it never, as you said, gets reported in the news, even
[01:12:30.360 --> 01:12:33.920]  when it's filed with police or the FBI, so they estimate that it could be two, three
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:36.400]  times higher, we never hear about it.
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:37.400]  Exactly.
[01:12:37.400 --> 01:12:38.920]  And if you look at it, what are they really trying to do?
[01:12:38.920 --> 01:12:43.080]  Not only distribute of your self-defense abilities from potential government oppression,
[01:12:43.080 --> 01:12:46.840]  but really it's more nefarious than that, because what it really does, it forces you
[01:12:46.840 --> 01:12:50.800]  to be dependent upon the government for your own protection.
[01:12:50.800 --> 01:12:53.880]  Protection of your liberty, protection of your property, because the only people that
[01:12:53.880 --> 01:12:58.600]  are allowed to have guns is the state, is the government itself.
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:01.480]  And everybody knows the criminals will get the guns, they've got them in every country
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:02.480]  that has been.
[01:13:02.480 --> 01:13:05.840]  Mars, I don't think I've ever heard a better breakdown of the Second Amendment and this
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:12.240]  extrajudicial takeover that is the global social psychology score, it is the architecture
[01:13:12.240 --> 01:13:17.360]  of tyranny, it is the big threat in our lifetimes and forward, and it is the central issue.
[01:13:17.360 --> 01:13:21.840]  So I salute you and this audience, and the crew, and Matt Drudge is on fire for exposing
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:22.840]  it.
[01:13:22.840 --> 01:13:23.840]  This is such an important time to be alive.
[01:13:23.840 --> 01:13:28.360]  We're going to be in studio next week to really launch some major lawsuits and a counter-offensive,
[01:13:28.360 --> 01:13:32.600]  and it is so many great things you're doing, so much of your work for me at cost.
[01:13:32.600 --> 01:13:36.720]  We salute you, and I think people should become members at your amazing organization.
[01:13:36.720 --> 01:13:39.960]  Again, tell people about the new organization.
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:47.080]  Yeah, it's Free America Law Center, anyone can find it at www.FreeAmericaLawCenter.com,
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:52.520]  FreeAmericaLawCenter.com for $17.76 a month so they can become a member.
[01:13:52.520 --> 01:13:54.680]  They just want to donate, they can do that too.
[01:13:54.680 --> 01:13:58.240]  But what we give them is, first of all, they are going to be supporting the most important
[01:13:58.240 --> 01:13:59.600]  litigation in the country.
[01:13:59.600 --> 01:14:04.360]  This doesn't go to legal fees, this goes to court cost, witness fees, service fees, all
[01:14:04.360 --> 01:14:08.320]  of those other incidental costs that right now we're paying out of our own pocket.
[01:14:08.320 --> 01:14:09.320]  Depositions.
[01:14:09.320 --> 01:14:10.320]  Exactly.
[01:14:10.320 --> 01:14:14.280]  I already have the lawyers lined up, lawyers to bring great cases to equalize the equation
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:18.840]  because the left has effectively monopolized public interest law in this country.
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:22.360]  So the left has taken over the ACLU entirely to where they're not defending anybody on the
[01:14:22.360 --> 01:14:23.440]  right anymore.
[01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:27.080]  The Southern Poverty Law Center has been a political hack organization for forever.
[01:14:27.080 --> 01:14:31.320]  We need to counterpart to the Southern Poverty Law Center and antidote to the liberal bias
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:32.560]  of the ACLU.
[01:14:32.560 --> 01:14:37.520]  The liberal profession as a whole has been able to, the legal profession leans liberal
[01:14:37.520 --> 01:14:42.440]  overwhelmingly, so that creates a problem where the left has almost a monopoly on what's
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:46.200]  happening in public interest law, about First Amendment, Second Amendment, Fourth Amendment,
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:49.680]  Fifth Amendment, Sixth Amendment, Seventh Amendment, fundamental constitutional rights
[01:14:49.680 --> 01:14:50.680]  and liberties.
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:54.360]  And those who become members, we're providing direct benefits too.
[01:14:54.360 --> 01:14:59.920]  So we're providing Q&A podcasts with lawyers and experts, providing free books every month
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:04.560]  that helps them become self-educated about fundamental constitutional rights and liberties,
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:08.160]  and they'll be supporting the most important litigation in the country to protect free
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:13.480]  speech, to protect a free press, to protect this First Amendment, Second Amendment, Fourth
[01:15:13.480 --> 01:15:14.960] , Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Amendment.
[01:15:14.960 --> 01:15:18.680]  Well, I know I'm getting super excited and you're the guy to do it, and you already
[01:15:18.680 --> 01:15:22.320]  followed some suits, but your next week, the real offensive begins.
[01:15:22.320 --> 01:15:26.520]  So again, for radio listeners, slowly tell people that address as we prepare to take
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:30.920]  action and tell people how they can, again, can hopefully spread that URL to others.
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:32.400]  It's the word of mouth that's king.
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.600]  Tell people the URL one more time.
[01:15:34.600 --> 01:15:35.600]  FreeAmericaLawCenter.com.
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:36.600]  All right.
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:37.600]  FreeAmericaLawCenter.com.
[01:15:37.600 --> 01:15:42.600]  Robert Barnes, we'll see you in studio next week via Kandiyos, my friend.
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:43.600]  Absolutely.

[01:19:04.840 --> 01:19:08.960]  We had over 5 billion views when we got banned and we're credited with getting Donald Trump
[01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:12.760]  elected because we were able to punch through and reach the grassroots.
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:17.400]  Now as we enter the 2020 election cycle, it's more important than ever that there be a place
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:24.720]  where the censors are unable to block the signal and it's now here, banned.video, banned.video

[01:20:32.720 --> 01:20:42.080]  Parks.
[01:20:42.080 --> 01:20:59.020]  Tom Pappert created a page with hundreds of millions of views andHHinck Stephen
[01:20:59.020 --> 01:21:04.700]  out by the university's administration. And of course, it was one of the top sites during
[01:21:04.700 --> 01:21:10.460]  the campaign. He also manages a TV station, syndicated talk show hosts. He's at RealG.E.
[01:21:10.460 --> 01:21:14.780]  Trump on Twitter, Facebook.com, or slash got him for Trump official.
[01:21:15.820 --> 01:21:19.740]  At the station, he's got up in Wichita, carries our show. And it's number one in the market
[01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:24.140]  after just a year and a half. We're very excited about that. It's like we're number one on cloud TV.
[01:21:24.780 --> 01:21:28.300]  We're number one everywhere. We're not banned. That's why we've got to be banned everywhere,
[01:21:28.300 --> 01:21:32.220]  because we're number one, because freedom is popular. Thanks to you spreading the word audience.
[01:21:32.220 --> 01:21:35.340]  You're number one. That's no brag. That's just a fact.
[01:21:36.940 --> 01:21:41.100]  Tom Pappert. Well, I like when we went to dinner last night, you described it.
[01:21:41.100 --> 01:21:44.300]  You started getting all these calls yesterday because you've got some big websites out there
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:49.900]  right from big league politics. Going, is this true that Trump's got this extra judiciary thing
[01:21:49.900 --> 01:21:53.900]  where they, that Ivanka's proposing? I dug into the Washington Post article. I don't just believe
[01:21:53.900 --> 01:21:58.380]  the Washington Post usually. Right. What they're saying is true. Now, did Trump really act favorably?
[01:21:58.380 --> 01:22:02.940]  Does he really support it? We don't know that. But one of his best friends is the guy proposing it.
[01:22:02.940 --> 01:22:09.420]  Ivanka's on record supporting it. So why don't you, in your own words, describe what this is?
[01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:13.500]  The headline went viral yesterday was Trump administration considering social
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:17.180]  credit score system determined who can buy a gun. I mean, you heard Barnes earlier,
[01:22:17.180 --> 01:22:20.620]  constitutional lawyer. This is the most draconian thing they ever had America.
[01:22:20.620 --> 01:22:24.700]  Yeah. And so if Trump supports this, he instantly becomes Hillary Clinton. I mean,
[01:22:24.700 --> 01:22:28.620]  I don't want to have to hate Trump and go after him. My God, I've been persecuted. We've gone
[01:22:28.620 --> 01:22:33.740]  through hell. We've done so many great things, but it's like taking care of your kid for 10 years
[01:22:33.740 --> 01:22:38.140]  and one day shooting him in the head with a shotgun. It kind of ruins everything else before. I mean,
[01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:43.660]  this is, this is unbelievable. And look, we're 24 hours into this being a firestorm,
[01:22:43.660 --> 01:22:47.020]  no tweets from Trump, no statements saying, Oh, no, we're not going to do this.
[01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:50.620]  So Tom Pappert first, how do you describe this? And then let's get into who's actually
[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:55.020]  on showing this thing that DARPA has already cooked up. Absolutely. Well, Alex, the number
[01:22:55.020 --> 01:22:59.020]  one thing is this is worse than anything Hillary Clinton could have done, because if we add
[01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:03.100]  President Hillary Clinton gone for bid, the Republicans would have been unified in their
[01:23:03.100 --> 01:23:07.260]  opposition to this type of thing. This is worse than China. It's social credit on steroids because
[01:23:07.260 --> 01:23:11.580]  in China, you don't have Alexa listening to every word you say, you don't have a Fitbit that
[01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:16.300]  monitors your heart rate. This is truly next level. It's beyond Orwell beyond anything that
[01:23:16.300 --> 01:23:20.060]  anybody's ever written about. And it's social credit is the best word for it. But really,
[01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:26.380]  it's so far beyond because this is in your house listening to every word you say, every tweet
[01:23:26.380 --> 01:23:30.700]  you make, they will be watching you. And they're going to use this, of course, ostensibly. What
[01:23:30.700 --> 01:23:35.180]  they say is to take the guns from would be mass killers. Well, I don't know how many would be
[01:23:35.180 --> 01:23:40.220]  mass killers say, Alexa, how do I kill 50 people in one sitting? It doesn't work that way. So
[01:23:40.220 --> 01:23:44.300]  they're going to use this to monitor mental health. This all comes and quote unquote mental
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:49.260]  health. This all comes from that side of the former administration, the Obama administration,
[01:23:49.260 --> 01:23:53.740]  the Clinton administration. It comes from people who are big on quote unquote mental health. And
[01:23:53.740 --> 01:23:58.460]  we all know how the Soviets handled mental health. If you are a dissident, if you are against the
[01:23:58.460 --> 01:24:03.180]  government, you are mentally insane and you must be taken to the gulag. So they're going to do that
[01:24:03.180 --> 01:24:08.860]  to first take our guns. Second, it is literally one of the top people who is behind pharmaceutical
[01:24:08.860 --> 01:24:14.380]  companies who is running this thing. The guy's name is Herb Partiz. He's on the board of Harpa
[01:24:14.380 --> 01:24:19.740]  and he's been labeled the king of forming psychopharma front groups. So if you say anything
[01:24:19.740 --> 01:24:23.500]  bad about the government, they're going to take your guns away. They're going to get you on psychotropic
[01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:27.500]  drugs, which are causing them almost all the mass shootings. Right. So the people actually guilty of
[01:24:27.500 --> 01:24:32.460]  it, who've created this mentally ill culture, now they've got their answer. We're going to
[01:24:32.460 --> 01:24:37.900]  surveil all of you and make you take drugs. And then outside of law, because they describe this
[01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:44.860]  harpa board with DARPA and big tech and psychiatrists, liberals will literally outside of law take
[01:24:44.860 --> 01:24:49.740]  all your guns. That's exactly what the plan is here. And what's sick is you know how this was
[01:24:49.740 --> 01:24:53.740]  pitched to President Trump. The idea is here, oh, this will respect the Second Amendment. We're
[01:24:53.740 --> 01:24:56.940]  just going to go after the crazy people. We'll take the guns away from the people who... They'll
[01:24:56.940 --> 01:25:00.860]  serve. They say they're going to kill somebody on the internet. The computers will see it. And
[01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:05.340]  you read the actual proposal. It's a way to roll out the total surveillance that's already happening
[01:25:05.340 --> 01:25:09.580]  and to get the left to support it, believing it's only for guns. It's for everything, people.
[01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:14.140]  That's exactly right. It will stamp down on any form of dissidence toward not just the Trump
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:19.500]  administration. Leftists should be up in Outroar right now. We used to care about the Constitution.
[01:25:19.500 --> 01:25:24.060]  The left used to care about privacy. In fact, nominally, they still do. When the left hits big
[01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:29.100]  tech, it is 100% about privacy. But let's go in. If it's all right with you, Alex. Some of the people
[01:25:29.100 --> 01:25:33.740]  who are involved in this organization is of course the Suzanne Wright Foundation. It's founder,
[01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:39.500]  Bob Wright. He was the former vice chair of General Electric and the CEO of the NBC Universal.
[01:25:39.500 --> 01:25:44.940]  Who paid Trump for 10 years on the apprentice. That's exactly right. Worse than that, founder
[01:25:44.940 --> 01:25:49.500]  of Autism Speaks, which of course is saying to stick your kids with every vaccine there is in
[01:25:49.500 --> 01:25:53.900]  existence. And then cover up what's causing it. Exactly. Exactly. He wants to lead the opposition.
[01:25:53.900 --> 01:25:58.700]  And naturally, as CEO of NBC, it's no surprise this guy donated money to... You name a Democrat,
[01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:05.180]  he probably donated, including to one Chuck Schumer. And it gets worse than that. It gets much worse.
[01:26:05.180 --> 01:26:10.860]  Dick Geppert, who served as the Democrat House Majority Leader from 89-95, then Minority Leader
[01:26:10.860 --> 01:26:16.060]  till 2003. This guy is involved and he almost was our last vice president. If it wasn't for
[01:26:16.060 --> 01:26:20.460]  Sleepy Joe Biden with his poor eye, I hope he has a full recovery. If it wasn't for Joe Biden,
[01:26:20.460 --> 01:26:25.020]  this guy would have been our vice president. He is now going to be taking the guns away.
[01:26:25.020 --> 01:26:30.060]  Mike Stebbins is on the Harper website, Harper website, listed as the former assistant director
[01:26:30.060 --> 01:26:34.780]  for biotechnology at the White House under the Obama administration. He also worked as a research
[01:26:34.780 --> 01:26:39.580]  fellow for Democrat Senator Harry Reid. And of course, we talked about her part. It's the guy
[01:26:39.580 --> 01:26:43.900]  who's going to say, oh, you tweeted at 2am saying that you love the Constitution. Here,
[01:26:43.900 --> 01:26:49.660]  have a box of Prozac. You need to take seven of these a day. These are the people who are going
[01:26:49.660 --> 01:26:54.380]  to determine who gets gun rights. So let's be clear. You're getting calls yesterday from all
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:58.940]  your big writers. Right. You know, a lot of former Breitbart, you name it. He runs the big sites.
[01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:04.060]  And they're like, is this really true? You're like, read it. It's all admitted. Ivanka's at the
[01:27:04.060 --> 01:27:08.940]  meetings. I've got a whole stack of them edit pushing it. And then one of Trump's best friends
[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:13.660]  is the guy that runs the foundation pushing it. And it's already in place with all these Obama
[01:27:13.660 --> 01:27:19.340]  people lobbying to get the funding and then merge it with DARPA, the NSA and all these agencies,
[01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:25.900]  these a public merger of big tech and the intelligence agencies to literally now have
[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:30.780]  them watching and reading everything we do under law and then using it outside of judicial
[01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:37.260]  due process. This is the total end of America. It's outrageous. And it's run by a bunch of
[01:27:37.260 --> 01:27:42.860]  Obama and Hillary people. Right. Now you know why we're so freaked out at Trump, folks. And a
[01:27:42.860 --> 01:27:47.020]  lot of conservatives can't believe this is happening. No, it's happening. It's real. Comprende.
[01:27:47.020 --> 01:27:50.620]  That's exactly right. And as you said, I was getting phone calls from my partners,
[01:27:50.620 --> 01:27:54.540]  my writers saying this is top linked on drudge. I can't believe this is happening. Is this just
[01:27:54.540 --> 01:27:58.300]  is this just drudge trying to turn people against Trump? Why would drudge do such a thing? This
[01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:02.620]  makes no sense. So then we look into your article. And of course, the first people to get this are
[01:28:02.620 --> 01:28:07.420]  the Washington Post, which is how you know it comes directly from the deep state. We were going
[01:28:07.420 --> 01:28:11.740]  to the Washington Post article and then it's very easy to do this type of research. You look up who
[01:28:11.740 --> 01:28:16.060]  is the Suzanne Wright Foundation? Who is the founder? Who is involved with it? What are these
[01:28:16.060 --> 01:28:20.860]  people's history? And it turns out this is completely Democrat. This is completely leftist.
[01:28:20.860 --> 01:28:24.860]  They are all part of the sick cabal that we call the deep state. Now it's one thing that I was
[01:28:24.860 --> 01:28:28.700]  pointing out yesterday. They didn't quite make it into the article, but you have been predicting
[01:28:28.700 --> 01:28:33.500]  this for your entire career. These people are instituting, they're creating this technology
[01:28:33.500 --> 01:28:37.340]  that is meant to monitor. And they're making themselves the kings of the dark crystal,
[01:28:37.340 --> 01:28:42.380]  right? They're making themselves the masters of the entire control grid, where they're above the
[01:28:42.380 --> 01:28:47.660]  law. They spy on everything. They set the algorithm to say you're mentally ill so you disappear.
[01:28:48.300 --> 01:28:55.100]  And Ivanka is sneaking up trying to get her dad to pass this. My lord, we'll be right back.

[01:33:25.740 --> 01:33:33.660]  Ladies and gentlemen, the Washington Post has come out and said that Trump is supporting
[01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:38.380]  a global social credit score with big tech spying on you with DARPA,
[01:33:38.380 --> 01:33:44.620]  an agency already being set up called HARPA run by Obama and Clinton high-level officials
[01:33:44.620 --> 01:33:51.340]  to use the medical tyranny system to come in outside of law with a psychological and social
[01:33:51.340 --> 01:33:56.780]  credit score and take your guns or borrow you from having a gun. Now obviously it's a trial balloon.
[01:33:57.420 --> 01:34:02.300]  Trump's going to end up shooting this down. Trump's a good guy. But this is some of the stuff going
[01:34:02.300 --> 01:34:07.180]  on with Ivanka who's never shot a gun in her life. Freaks out if she breaks the nail. I'm sorry,
[01:34:07.180 --> 01:34:11.660]  she's domesticated. You know, billionaire rich girl from New York. His sons aren't there. They're
[01:34:11.660 --> 01:34:17.900]  against this. Eric and Don Jr. But this is a nightmare situation and we've learned and we
[01:34:17.900 --> 01:34:24.220]  just listed them. All these top Democrats from Obama mainly and some from Hillary are running
[01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:28.220]  the whole thing. So your headline, I mean, how do you make it bombshell enough?
[01:34:31.180 --> 01:34:35.820]  Obama officials are running the Trump administration's push
[01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:43.260]  for anti-gun social credit score. I mean, it's even worse than that. I don't know how you
[01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:46.860]  describe this. We'll talk to Mike Adams in a moment and get his expert take on how you describe
[01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:53.420]  something this bad. It's like it's like trying to describe the house burning down or something
[01:34:53.420 --> 01:34:57.100]  and with kids in it. I mean, you just you got to see it to know what it's like and you don't want
[01:34:57.100 --> 01:35:01.740]  to see it. So this is out of control. We're going to Mike Adams in a moment on this and more. And
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:08.780]  then his big article on Bernie Sanders endorsing the accelerated targeted aborting of brown people's
[01:35:08.780 --> 01:35:16.460]  children worldwide. But Tom Papert, syndicated talk show host, right for big league politics.com
[01:35:16.460 --> 01:35:21.340]  has some of your own big news sites. You were going over this. How do you describe this?
[01:35:21.340 --> 01:35:25.900]  We need to get horrified. Some people are like, Hey, don't criticize Trump. The Dems will win.
[01:35:25.900 --> 01:35:28.460]  We're the ones that put Trump in. And if we don't stay on him,
[01:35:29.900 --> 01:35:33.660]  the establishment's going to sell him a bill of goods. We're doing God's work here. I know
[01:35:33.660 --> 01:35:38.700]  most of the audience gets that knows that, but we need to be very aggressive right now. Go ahead.
[01:35:38.700 --> 01:35:42.300]  You're completely right, Alex, because this is by and large the worst thing that's come out of
[01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:47.020]  the Trump administration. If it were to be put into place already the Trump administration and I
[01:35:47.020 --> 01:35:51.100]  am a big supporter of President Trump, but when he is wrong, he is completely and totally wrong.
[01:35:51.100 --> 01:35:55.340]  And this is the most sickening thing you've seen in your life. If a Democrat tried to do this,
[01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:58.460]  you would have insurrection. You would have violence in the streets and I
[01:35:58.460 --> 01:36:03.740]  abhor violence, which is why I want this to be ended. I don't know how it can be overstated.
[01:36:03.740 --> 01:36:08.780]  Your refrigerator will be spying on you. Your your smart watch will be spying on you. The thing
[01:36:08.780 --> 01:36:12.380]  that tells you how many steps you've taken. They admit they already are. They need this is the
[01:36:12.380 --> 01:36:17.500]  bridge to get you to accept it. Right. Well, and it's the bridge between the private sector,
[01:36:17.500 --> 01:36:21.740]  all these companies that were founded with government support and with government money
[01:36:21.740 --> 01:36:26.060]  in many instances, they will be given official carte blanche permission to share that data with
[01:36:26.060 --> 01:36:30.140]  the government. I can only imagine what Jeff Bezos would do with that opportunity to share
[01:36:30.140 --> 01:36:34.940]  whatever comes into his Alexa with the federal government with the purpose of eradicating
[01:36:34.940 --> 01:36:38.220]  any type of patriotic behavior, because that's what this is going to be used for.
[01:36:38.220 --> 01:36:42.540]  It's never going to be about guns. The guns is a total misdirection. This is for social
[01:36:42.540 --> 01:36:46.940]  control and social engineering. Imagine this. You get a you get a police officer coming to
[01:36:46.940 --> 01:36:51.180]  your door and they say, we know that you were up at 3 a.m. last night watching an Alex Jones
[01:36:51.180 --> 01:36:56.300]  documentary. You need to go to a mental health official right now. We're going to get you on
[01:36:56.300 --> 01:37:00.380]  a drug. And if you resist, we're already taking your guns. If you resist, you're going to be
[01:37:00.380 --> 01:37:04.540]  arrested. That's what the Democrats have been saying. Burn down their houses, flatten them,
[01:37:04.540 --> 01:37:09.260]  put them all in mental institutions. You know, the Trump needs to be put in the mental institution.
[01:37:09.820 --> 01:37:13.660]  25th Amendment. Mike Adams, I want to get into Bernie Sanders with you next segment. You've
[01:37:13.660 --> 01:37:18.220]  written a very powerful article on naturalnews.com. It's also up on m4s.com. Bernie Sanders announced
[01:37:18.220 --> 01:37:22.780]  the support for global eugenics and the population call for accelerating abortions in countries
[01:37:22.780 --> 01:37:30.620]  populated by people of color. Unbelievable. But your take on what's being proposed to Trump
[01:37:30.620 --> 01:37:34.700]  in the Washington Post saying he likes the idea. I think I mean, I know it's being pushed by people
[01:37:34.700 --> 01:37:38.780]  in the administration. I think once Trump learns they're doing his name, he's going to come out
[01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:44.300]  against it. But we haven't seen that yet. What's your spidey sense tell you? Well, it all comes
[01:37:44.300 --> 01:37:51.420]  down to who defines mental health. And mental disorders are defined as being divergent from
[01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:56.780]  normalcy. So it really depends on who defines normalcy. Now, according to the radical leftist,
[01:37:56.780 --> 01:38:02.860]  normalcy is the chemical castration of children. Normalcy is saying that men can get pregnant
[01:38:02.860 --> 01:38:08.540]  and have babies. You know, normalcy is eugenics and depopulation and putting sterilization chemicals
[01:38:08.540 --> 01:38:15.260]  into the vaccines. Drinking fluoride water, having lower IQs, not living as long, having normalcy is
[01:38:15.260 --> 01:38:20.780]  a post human world. Yeah, exactly. So they're going to say really, just as Tom mentioned,
[01:38:20.780 --> 01:38:27.260]  anyone who questions the authority of the establishment will be labeled as having a mental
[01:38:27.260 --> 01:38:33.020]  health disorder. And with that label, you will be denied the right to purchase firearms. I mean,
[01:38:33.020 --> 01:38:38.060]  this is this is a divine right. No government can legitimately interfere with that, right? But
[01:38:38.060 --> 01:38:42.460]  you'll be denied the right to speak, the right to engage in contract, the right to earn money,
[01:38:42.460 --> 01:38:46.380]  the right to have a job. I mean, this is this is the social scoring system. But under the guys of
[01:38:46.380 --> 01:38:50.940]  mental health, why do you think they've gone from denying this for decades, even though we watch them
[01:38:50.940 --> 01:38:54.540]  do it in other countries to admitting it all? I mean, I think they now know they're somewhat
[01:38:54.540 --> 01:38:58.380]  behind. There's an awakening. So they're just trying to normalize it all at once. A, do you agree
[01:38:58.380 --> 01:39:03.820]  with that? B, where do you think it goes? How does this cookie crumble? Well, I see this actually
[01:39:03.820 --> 01:39:08.380]  as a last ditch desperate Hail Mary by the establishment that is losing control of the
[01:39:08.380 --> 01:39:13.580]  narrative globally, because of the existence of the independent media, organizations like yours
[01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:17.820]  and many others that are questioning the official narratives, which are all lies. You know, who
[01:39:17.820 --> 01:39:23.900]  believes CNN anymore, you literally have to be brain damaged to watch CNN and believe anything
[01:39:23.900 --> 01:39:30.220]  that they're saying. Last night's climate change town hall circus, it was it was a joke. It was a
[01:39:30.220 --> 01:39:36.140]  it was a parade of scientific illiteracy. You have to be dumbed down to watch that. So they're
[01:39:36.140 --> 01:39:40.780]  desperate. They know that they're going to lose if we continue to push Alex. And that's why it's
[01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:46.220]  critical that you exist, that your platform exists, and that we continue to educate people,
[01:39:46.220 --> 01:39:49.740]  uplift people and connect people about what's really happening and fight for humanity.
[01:39:50.460 --> 01:39:54.060]  I agree with you. We're going to get into what happened with Bernie Sanders and others last
[01:39:54.060 --> 01:39:57.180]  night. We come back for a few segments and peppered your ride to shotgun in the next hour.
[01:39:57.180 --> 01:40:00.540]  The fruit of Rick Ross is a little bit behind driving down from Dallas. He'll be in studio
[01:40:00.540 --> 01:40:05.660]  with us in the middle of the next hour. But I agree with you. The numbers show it. The ratings
[01:40:05.660 --> 01:40:11.100]  show it. The general public is showing it. Just since this whole thing came out with Epstein,
[01:40:11.980 --> 01:40:18.940]  just since the fluoride studies, which you already had, we had decades ago. But but but now I mean
[01:40:18.940 --> 01:40:27.260]  now I use this as a as a bellwether. They'll have anti Alex Jones videos on YouTube and 95% of the
[01:40:27.260 --> 01:40:33.900]  comments 90% are positive. Even though the videos anti Alex Jones used to it'd be 50 50 against me.
[01:40:33.900 --> 01:40:39.740]  And I see that with other people and I see it on the street now where I'm more popular than ever.
[01:40:39.740 --> 01:40:44.780]  Maybe one out of 100 people for every hand I shake one out of 100 says F.U. Russian agent.
[01:40:44.780 --> 01:40:49.900]  Now the left doesn't even do that. So I think there's been a collapse in confidence. But like you
[01:40:49.900 --> 01:40:54.700]  said, the small minority of supporters that are kind of low level minders, they know it's all
[01:40:54.700 --> 01:40:58.700]  bull to but they're associated with the power structure. So they're trying to bully us and
[01:40:58.700 --> 01:41:03.820]  prop it up. They don't realize that we were asleep before we weren't bullied before and that the
[01:41:03.820 --> 01:41:08.220]  bullying is only pissing us off. Do you remember those statements? Well, absolutely. And I think
[01:41:08.220 --> 01:41:13.260]  also, by the way, the the murder of Jeffrey Epstein was a big wake up call a big turning
[01:41:13.260 --> 01:41:17.820]  point for a lot of people. They realized that everything is rigged that Epstein, he had his
[01:41:17.820 --> 01:41:24.380]  fingers into every dark, you know, twisted corner of a globalist society. And that those those
[01:41:24.380 --> 01:41:29.820]  children were being trafficked and raped. And probably, you know, other other kind of weird,
[01:41:29.820 --> 01:41:35.180]  bizarre demonic rituals were involved as well. People are waking up. Every time the establishment
[01:41:35.180 --> 01:41:39.900]  tries to cover up one of these big aha moments, the people actually go, Wait a second, we're
[01:41:39.900 --> 01:41:44.300]  being lied to everything is a lie. Let's find out the truth. And that's why they're watching
[01:41:44.300 --> 01:41:51.980]  info wars. This is what's happening. So what happens next? Well, if we can continue to press
[01:41:51.980 --> 01:41:56.940]  this issue, we're going to see at some point the collapse of CNN. We're going to see the
[01:41:56.940 --> 01:42:01.900]  collapse of the left wing media. I think in fact, if Trump will just release and perhaps
[01:42:01.900 --> 01:42:06.780]  William Barr will release several of these key FISA warrant related documents, that the collapse
[01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:13.500]  will be accelerated. I see a future in the 2020s where CNN actually does not exist any longer,
[01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:17.660]  because their credibility is so negative, who would watch them? They will collapse,
[01:42:17.660 --> 01:42:21.180]  they will be gone. That's what I see coming. Now, I think what they're trying to do with this,
[01:42:21.180 --> 01:42:24.700]  though, it's so obvious, they want to drug us and tell me if I'm wrong about this, Mike Adams,
[01:42:24.700 --> 01:42:29.180]  but they want to drug us. They want to molify us, molify us. They want to turn us into a bunch of
[01:42:29.180 --> 01:42:33.820]  happy little sheep again. And I think that's why this push is happening now. And it's happening so,
[01:42:33.820 --> 01:42:37.980]  so heavily, because if they can get us back asleep, then maybe they can win. Otherwise,
[01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:41.740]  I think you're totally right. We'll talk about that as Mike Adams is one of the experts on that.
[01:42:41.740 --> 01:42:47.260]  And then we'll get into Bernie Sanders and his outrageously racist statement that's being praised

[01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:53.980]  change.
[01:47:53.980 --> 01:47:59.740]  Human population growth has more than doubled in the past 50 years. The planet cannot sustain
[01:47:59.740 --> 01:48:05.340]  this growth. I realize this is a poisonous topic for politicians, but it's crucial to face.
[01:48:05.980 --> 01:48:11.500]  Empowering women and educating everyone on the need to curb population growth seems
[01:48:11.500 --> 01:48:16.940]  a reasonable campaign to enact. Would you be courageous enough to discuss this issue and
[01:48:16.940 --> 01:48:20.380]  make it a key feature of a plan to address climate catastrophe?
[01:48:20.380 --> 01:48:28.220]  Well, mostly the answer is yes. And the answer has everything to do with the fact that women
[01:48:28.220 --> 01:48:33.180]  in the United States of America, by the way, have a right to control their own bodies and
[01:48:33.180 --> 01:48:41.740]  make reproductive decisions. And the Mexico City Agreement, which denies American aid to
[01:48:41.740 --> 01:48:48.860]  those organizations around the world that allow women to have abortions or even get involved
[01:48:48.860 --> 01:48:57.100]  in birth control is absurd. So I think especially in poor countries around the world, where women
[01:48:57.100 --> 01:49:02.860]  do not necessarily want to have large numbers of babies and where they can have the opportunity
[01:49:02.860 --> 01:49:06.860]  through birth control to control the number of kids they have, something I very, very strongly
[01:49:07.500 --> 01:49:11.820]  support. But what's really going on is in African areas, they don't give the women
[01:49:12.460 --> 01:49:16.620]  access to any type of assistance unless they get sterilized. And you can argue, well,
[01:49:16.620 --> 01:49:21.100]  there are too many of these people. No, we didn't industrialize it. The globalists have,
[01:49:21.100 --> 01:49:24.780]  Mike Adams, you're an expert on this. You really know how to lay it out. What's really going on
[01:49:24.780 --> 01:49:28.940]  here? Well, first of all, the question itself is loaded. Remember that the questions are
[01:49:28.940 --> 01:49:34.460]  pre-approved by CNN. And the question equates courage with murdering black babies all over
[01:49:34.460 --> 01:49:39.100]  the world, essentially. So the question was, Bernie Sanders, would you be courageous enough
[01:49:39.100 --> 01:49:45.500]  to support the coordinated global funding of the mass murder and infanticide of babies of color?
[01:49:45.500 --> 01:49:49.660]  That's essentially the realistic translation of that. And he said, yes, sure. He's all for it.
[01:49:50.220 --> 01:49:53.740]  And what's really shocking about this is, again, it's out in the open. You know,
[01:49:53.740 --> 01:49:59.340]  you and I have warned about this for many, many years. There's a globalist depopulation agenda.
[01:49:59.340 --> 01:50:04.300]  Well, now you can add to that that Bernie Sanders is promoting a global eugenics agenda,
[01:50:04.300 --> 01:50:10.780]  and he wants US taxpayers to pay for that eugenics program to snuff out the lives of both
[01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:17.500]  unborn and post-born babies of color all over the world. And it makes you wonder, how can any person
[01:50:17.500 --> 01:50:24.860]  of color in the United States vote for a Democrat when their agenda is genocide? It is the mass
[01:50:24.860 --> 01:50:31.420]  murder of babies of color, infants of color, born and unborn. And the fact that this question is
[01:50:31.420 --> 01:50:35.820]  loaded, trying to equate this with courage and then equate it with climate change. So now you see
[01:50:35.820 --> 01:50:42.060]  the climate hoax is being pushed in order to promote depopulation and the mass genocide of
[01:50:42.060 --> 01:50:47.980]  humanity. And this isn't new, Alex. As I quoted in my story, The New York Times wrote an article
[01:50:47.980 --> 01:50:56.220]  back in 1969 where the science advisor to President Richard Nixon, Dr. Lee DuBridge, called for spiking
[01:50:56.220 --> 01:51:02.060]  food exports from the United States with covert sterilization chemicals so that the food exported
[01:51:02.060 --> 01:51:07.340]  to third world countries and African nations and places of color, that food would cause massive
[01:51:07.340 --> 01:51:12.300]  infertility. And by the way, that's also in the White House science are under Obama, John P. Holdren's
[01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:17.420]  book 1974, Ecoscience will actually have a copy of right here. I'll grab it in a moment. It's down
[01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:21.580]  here on the floor, but let's pull back. I used to, my memory was good enough, but I've been through
[01:51:21.580 --> 01:51:26.700]  the wars now. I used to know the name of the memorandum. But guys, type in Henry Kissinger,
[01:51:26.700 --> 01:51:38.940]  presidential memorandum on depopulation, 1974, declassified 1991. And in it, he says the same
[01:51:38.940 --> 01:51:44.220]  thing, ship our toxic waste to the third world and put stuff in the food to sterilize them.
[01:51:44.220 --> 01:51:49.420]  So that that was official policy. He couldn't get Nixon to sign off on it. But that was a letter
[01:51:49.420 --> 01:51:53.820]  that he gave to Nixon proposing that. So guys, type in Henry. Yeah, there it is. There it is.
[01:51:53.820 --> 01:52:01.580]  National Security Study in SSM 200 1974. It's our December 10th. I mean, wow, look at that
[01:52:01.580 --> 01:52:08.540]  classified by Harry S. Blaney. And folks, it's now declassified 1991 National Security Council.
[01:52:08.540 --> 01:52:14.460]  We're not playing games. Are we, Mike Adams? No, Alex, and imagine, I mean, now global depopulation
[01:52:14.460 --> 01:52:21.340]  and eugenics of children of color is now the Democrat platform. Could you imagine the outcry
[01:52:21.340 --> 01:52:25.820]  if President Trump were to say something as crazy as that? If President Trump were to say,
[01:52:25.820 --> 01:52:31.100]  hey, we need to depopulate the world of black people. Can you imagine what kind of hysteria
[01:52:31.100 --> 01:52:35.820]  would ensue across the media? But when Bernie Sanders says it, it's all okay. Now let's talk
[01:52:35.820 --> 01:52:39.180]  third dimensional chess here. Let's talk third dimensional chess, because I read the Royal
[01:52:39.180 --> 01:52:44.460]  Commission by his Royal Highness, the King of England, the father of Queen Elizabeth II,
[01:52:44.460 --> 01:52:50.460]  49 published and they said, we're the dominant empire. We could industrialize the third world
[01:52:50.460 --> 01:52:55.820]  and make them up to our standards, and then they'll only have two kids. But if we let them bloom
[01:52:56.380 --> 01:53:01.340]  and have an overpopulation, we can exploit the population, then use it against the first world
[01:53:01.340 --> 01:53:04.620]  to lower everybody's standards and dominate the planet. We're going to go with that. So even if
[01:53:04.620 --> 01:53:08.700]  you believe the world's overpopulated in some areas, it is toxic. It is overpopulated the way
[01:53:08.700 --> 01:53:13.500]  the systems are, but they're suppressing new technologies. Then they weaponize third world,
[01:53:13.500 --> 01:53:19.740]  put them in refugee camps, brainwash them against the West, and then bring them in weaponized. So
[01:53:19.740 --> 01:53:27.180]  you see the master dialectic, the master plan that they're engaged in. Yeah, and this master plan
[01:53:27.180 --> 01:53:31.660]  ultimately ends with the destruction of human civilization as we know it. Let's not forget
[01:53:31.660 --> 01:53:36.140]  that some of these same globalists like Bill Gates is running Project Scopex, which would
[01:53:36.140 --> 01:53:42.300]  pollute the atmosphere to dim the sun, to block photosynthesis, and collapse global food webs
[01:53:42.300 --> 01:53:46.620]  and cause mass starvation all across the planet. And again, Alex, these are all admitted.
[01:53:46.620 --> 01:53:50.940]  Stop there a little bit more into this because we've covered the Kim trailing. We've covered
[01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:56.860]  the aerosol. It's all declassified. Now suddenly they admit we've been spraying in a global test.
[01:53:56.860 --> 01:54:01.740]  A Nobel Prize was won in 92 by scientists. It's added to jet fuel. It's where are we
[01:54:01.740 --> 01:54:06.140]  vindicated Mike? We're suddenly it's on the news. Oh, we are spraying for your safety, but
[01:54:06.860 --> 01:54:12.140]  it's still secret, but we're not vindicated. No, it's crazy. I mean, just think of this example.
[01:54:12.140 --> 01:54:17.500]  CNN now says all hurricanes are manmade, but that it's a conspiracy theory to believe in
[01:54:17.500 --> 01:54:21.900]  weather control. So, you know, even their own narratives contradict that hurricanes are false
[01:54:21.900 --> 01:54:27.340]  because Cal's fart, but when they go and spray it, use electromagnetic beams that are declassified
[01:54:27.340 --> 01:54:33.660]  to control them, which was certified in 1967, Stanford Research Institute declassified 2004.
[01:54:33.660 --> 01:54:38.700]  Ben Livingston went public on my show and it was all declassified. Then we're the cooks.
[01:54:38.700 --> 01:54:44.220]  Well, exactly. And look, we've been vindicated again and again and again. The truth is the
[01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:50.940]  globalists are at war with humanity. They want to mass murder humans, and they want to silence
[01:54:50.940 --> 01:54:57.820]  anyone who is speaking out in favor of humanity. Because you don't cover flying saucers. I don't
[01:54:57.820 --> 01:55:02.940]  cover it either. I go off real hard documents. Bernie Sanders is endorsing national security
[01:55:02.940 --> 01:55:07.900]  memorandum 200 for global extermination of brown people. Okay, we just showed it on screen.
[01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:14.220]  It's public. This is not fake folks. So why are the elites so anti human? And why are they running
[01:55:14.220 --> 01:55:18.780]  100 year plans? And why are they so ahead of us? Well, depends on how many layers deep you want
[01:55:18.780 --> 01:55:24.220]  to go on this, Alex, but at simplest level, the globalists believe that they want to inherit the
[01:55:24.220 --> 01:55:29.100]  earth by eliminating most of the human population so that they can have the planet for themselves
[01:55:29.100 --> 01:55:34.860]  all automated with robot automation systems and exotic technology that they've been suppressing,
[01:55:34.860 --> 01:55:39.420]  but will use themselves once they eliminate what they call the so called useless eaters of the
[01:55:39.420 --> 01:55:45.740]  world. So global depopulation and eugenics is out in the open now. That is their plan. And by the
[01:55:45.740 --> 01:55:49.180]  way, Democrats should be alarmed because it's the people in the cities that are going to be killed
[01:55:49.180 --> 01:55:53.900]  off the most by these plans. The cities are where you can't survive. You can't grow food.
[01:55:53.900 --> 01:55:59.420]  All the inputs are artificial. If you don't have electricity and food and fuel input into the cities,
[01:55:59.420 --> 01:56:04.140]  you know, imported, the cities collapse with into mass death. That's where the Democrats live. And
[01:56:04.140 --> 01:56:08.380]  yet they're supporting the very same globalists that are pushing these depopulation.
[01:56:08.380 --> 01:56:12.060]  Mike, I should have you in studio sometime for like two hours, because you're you really
[01:56:12.060 --> 01:56:16.780]  done your research as an engineer, best selling author, you name it. How you see the different
[01:56:16.780 --> 01:56:20.620]  scenarios, how it breaks down because the globalists admit they're going to collapse nation states,
[01:56:20.620 --> 01:56:25.340]  even collapse their world order. That's just a cover story and go to high tech city states
[01:56:25.340 --> 01:56:28.620]  that are armored, you know, people like, wait, that sounds like the other games. Well, that's a
[01:56:28.620 --> 01:56:33.260]  mirror of the real plan. They're externalizing the method predictive programming. But but they
[01:56:33.260 --> 01:56:38.780]  admit it's going to be an advanced technology, breakaway civilization. The futures here is just
[01:56:38.780 --> 01:56:43.420]  not equally distributed. And then we'll all be outside of it. Well, I want Bernie Sanders and
[01:56:43.420 --> 01:56:47.020]  the globalists and all of them to know you guys are never going to get away with this. We know
[01:56:47.020 --> 01:56:50.940]  of the plan now. So you're not going to be in your armored fortress is getting away with this.
[01:56:52.380 --> 01:56:58.220]  Yeah, there's, you know, look, your audience knows more than any viewer of CNN or New York
[01:56:58.220 --> 01:57:03.660]  Times. And they know that humanity is under attack. But this is a global scale war against
[01:57:03.660 --> 01:57:10.380]  humanity and against the survivability or the sustainability of the human race. So we are
[01:57:10.380 --> 01:57:14.860]  under attack. There is a war. And you can only get the truth through the independent media
[01:57:14.860 --> 01:57:18.780]  with info wars leading the way. That's the bottom line. If you want to live, it's like what the
[01:57:18.780 --> 01:57:23.340]  terminator said in that in that movie, you want to live with me, you want to live come with me.
[01:57:23.340 --> 01:57:26.300]  If you want to live, stay tuned info wars, because that's where you're going to get
[01:57:26.300 --> 01:57:29.660]  to. By the way, you don't say that like on a power trip or natural news.com or big league
[01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:34.860]  politics. This is real. We're showing you real memorandums to kill you. They're putting fluoride
[01:57:34.860 --> 01:57:39.900]  in the water to lower your fertility and make you an idiot. Come right back. I want to talk
[01:57:39.900 --> 01:57:43.340]  about this. You're leaving in five minutes to me and Papper to break it all down. Take calls
[01:57:43.340 --> 01:57:49.340]  through a Rick Ross coming in studio statewide. And that's why we're introducing what we know
[01:57:49.340 --> 01:57:54.780]  is going to be a massive bestseller. Chill force. Now let's look at what's in this powerful formula.
[01:57:54.780 --> 01:58:00.780]  Ashwagandha root extract, an ancient medicinal herb used for over 3000 years to treat stress
[01:58:00.780 --> 01:58:06.380]  and relax the patient. L-theanine, a special amino acid naturally found in some tea leaves.
[01:58:06.380 --> 01:58:11.580]  The compound has been called the stress killer because of its powerful relaxation benefits.
[01:58:11.580 --> 01:58:15.740]  Gabba, an important neurotransmitter that controls functions of the body and mind,
[01:58:15.740 --> 01:58:20.940]  including nervous system relaxation. Gabba is a choice for many to help reduce anxiety.
[01:58:20.940 --> 01:58:26.140]  Rhodiola rosea root extract found in the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.
[01:58:26.140 --> 01:58:30.940]  This root is considered a super adaptogen and is believed to help the body in the fight against
[01:58:30.940 --> 01:58:36.300]  emotional, mental and physical stress. It's time to do what I did and take action with the chill
[01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:50.300]  force challenge at info wars live dot com. Josh in Washington, you're on the air. Go ahead.
[01:58:50.300 --> 01:58:55.660]  Alex, God bless you. I have an idea for a new info wars t-shirt instead of this is your brain.
[01:58:55.660 --> 01:59:00.620]  This is your brain on drugs. This is your brain. This is your brain on 5g. Oh, yeah.
[01:59:00.620 --> 01:59:03.900]  Showing your brain, getting fried. Then I have some comments on your supplements. Man,
[01:59:03.900 --> 01:59:08.780]  totally changed my life. I use turbo force bodies, alpha power, brain force, fish oil,
[01:59:08.780 --> 01:59:13.980]  ultra 12 daily x2 every several days. Now, what I've found is, is really combining them
[01:59:13.980 --> 01:59:19.260]  is totally synergistic and transcendent feeling that I get by combining all your products.
[01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:22.700]  And I just want to urge all your listeners who haven't tried them. I just want to say why not.
[01:59:22.700 --> 01:59:26.700]  Well, you're right. And all of these things are known to be incredible, whether it's turmeric,
[01:59:26.700 --> 01:59:30.380]  or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil, or whether it's the DNA force with the
[01:59:30.380 --> 01:59:34.700]  CoQ 10 and bio PQQ and all the rest of it. All of these are things that are like rocket fuel on
[01:59:34.700 --> 01:59:39.100]  the body. You take these bases together, then you have your foundation. Now you can build the
[01:59:39.100 --> 01:59:43.100]  big strong temple with these products. I take when I were literally remember to take them. It makes
[01:59:43.100 --> 01:59:47.020]  my life so much better. And then it funds the information war, which is so critical. Thank
[01:59:47.020 --> 01:59:53.340]  you so much. God bless you. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:00:03.500 --> 02:00:09.580]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance. It's Alex Jones.
[02:00:09.580 --> 02:00:17.740]  Tom Pappert writes for bigleaguepolitics.com. He also runs a TV station. We're on with
[02:00:17.740 --> 02:00:21.660]  number one of the ratings from nowhere when I first got on there in that time slot. We're
[02:00:21.660 --> 02:00:26.860]  excited about that. We actually have our own channel. And of course, Mike Adams of naturalnews.com.
[02:00:26.860 --> 02:00:31.100]  What he said is the globalist want to inherit the earth, survival of the fetus. They believe they
[02:00:31.100 --> 02:00:36.540]  can dumb us down, make us only care about sports or whatever that they will inherit the future.
[02:00:36.540 --> 02:00:41.980]  They will dominate the future. Mike, I agree with you that humanity is
[02:00:41.980 --> 02:00:45.980]  awakening. I don't want to just get on some jack bashing Trump. But the fact that the
[02:00:45.980 --> 02:00:50.140]  Washington Post is trying to float the idea that Trump should do this and Trump should get behind
[02:00:51.100 --> 02:00:56.140]  these digital systems. I'm not doing this to attack Trump. I'm doing it to make sure that
[02:00:56.140 --> 02:01:01.420]  he's aware of these snakes around him and what they're trying to push. Well, I know you were
[02:01:01.420 --> 02:01:05.900]  very careful in that coverage. You did not accuse Trump of endorsing this idea. And in fact,
[02:01:05.900 --> 02:01:11.900]  I think you're correct that he will resist this idea and he will oppose it. Trump is America's
[02:01:11.900 --> 02:01:17.740]  real last hope to defeat the deep state. Trump isn't perfect. None of us are. But he is. He's
[02:01:17.740 --> 02:01:21.820]  got his heart in the right place. He loves America. He wants to protect and defend America. And he
[02:01:21.820 --> 02:01:25.980]  especially wants the deep state criminals and traders to be exposed. And I believe he wants
[02:01:25.980 --> 02:01:31.020]  them to go to prison and face criminal charges, which I hope that happens. Oh, we know he's
[02:01:31.020 --> 02:01:34.220]  ordered them to be classes by it and they never do what he they never do what he says.
[02:01:34.220 --> 02:01:40.540]  Yeah. Well, exactly. Well, the swamp is still too powerful and too embedded in the system. And,
[02:01:40.540 --> 02:01:44.220]  you know, Tom there, you know, this is what you've covered this. And by the way, I admire your work
[02:01:44.220 --> 02:01:49.660]  greatly. You're doing great work. But the Trump is one guy. He's not a dictator. We don't want
[02:01:49.660 --> 02:01:55.020]  to be a dictator. And so he's got to fight and navigate this swamp system that is so corrupt
[02:01:55.020 --> 02:02:02.140]  and so infiltrated with traders that no one person could solve this in a single term. Trump needs
[02:02:02.140 --> 02:02:06.940]  a second term. Only then will we really have hope to get rid of the swamp at any meaningful level.
[02:02:06.940 --> 02:02:11.500]  That's my assessment. Tom, you know, I think you're absolutely right. And thank you, Mike. I
[02:02:11.500 --> 02:02:15.900]  really appreciate that. But I mean, the real problem is it's almost a repeat of what we saw
[02:02:15.900 --> 02:02:19.340]  with Ronald Reagan, where he starts out and he has good instincts and he makes good moves.
[02:02:19.340 --> 02:02:23.420]  All of the Patriots. Are they shooting? Yeah, well, and I'm sure they've tried to do the exact
[02:02:23.420 --> 02:02:27.500]  same thing to President Trump. But they've perched everybody they can from the administration who
[02:02:27.500 --> 02:02:31.900]  is a patriot. You've got Stephen Miller and one or two people left. I only hope that as we move
[02:02:31.900 --> 02:02:36.220]  closer, you're seeing it's almost like a singularity happening, Alex. I used to say in six months,
[02:02:36.220 --> 02:02:39.660]  everything if people doubt you in six months, you'll be proven completely right. Well, now it's
[02:02:39.660 --> 02:02:44.620]  about six days. In the last month, we had fluoride. In the last month, we had virtually every single
[02:02:44.620 --> 02:02:48.700]  thing Jeffrey Epstein elite pedophile rings. I mean, this is all coming out more and more.
[02:02:48.700 --> 02:02:53.580]  People are waking up. This is the ammunition that President Trump needs to begin to take
[02:02:53.580 --> 02:02:58.940]  legal and lawful action against these people. And I think you're right, Mike. I think the last
[02:02:58.940 --> 02:03:02.940]  year and a half of this administration and then the next four years are going to be vital.
[02:03:03.980 --> 02:03:09.580]  I think Trump needs to know that we, the people are willing to defend him and defend this nation.
[02:03:09.580 --> 02:03:14.460]  If the deep state moves on Trump, we will move on the deep state in defense of our nation,
[02:03:14.460 --> 02:03:18.940]  in defense of the rule of law. We don't initiate violence, but we are absolutely,
[02:03:18.940 --> 02:03:23.580]  we've taken an oath many, many Americans, millions of Americans have taken an oath to defend this
[02:03:23.580 --> 02:03:27.660]  nation against his enemies. So if they go after Trump, we'll go after them. Trump needs to know
[02:03:27.660 --> 02:03:31.660]  we're on his side here. Well, that's right. And now, I mean, it's not just a talking point.
[02:03:31.660 --> 02:03:36.220]  Anytime I turn on the, it's like, we're going to hurt Trump supporters. We're going to destroy him.
[02:03:36.220 --> 02:03:39.660]  We're going to bully him. We're going to put him in prison. And at a certain point,
[02:03:39.660 --> 02:03:43.260]  that type of behavior, that type of talk, I'm not looking for a physical fight,
[02:03:43.260 --> 02:03:46.540]  but we're trying to fix this peacefully, but we're not going to just sit here
[02:03:46.540 --> 02:03:51.340]  while they come and have their way with us. And so this is a very dangerous time. We better
[02:03:51.340 --> 02:03:55.660]  all work extra hard right now to peacefully fix this. I agree. I think that that's the most
[02:03:55.660 --> 02:03:59.420]  important thing that we do this legally, lawfully, politically. That's the way it has to happen.
[02:03:59.420 --> 02:04:04.300]  I don't want to know what this world looks like if that can't happen. But just last month,
[02:04:04.300 --> 02:04:09.180]  you had Antifa, and I believe it was in upstate New York, calling for death camps for conservatives.
[02:04:09.180 --> 02:04:12.220]  So make no doubt, we're trying to do this peacefully. We want to do this peacefully. I
[02:04:12.220 --> 02:04:15.500]  abhor violence. I despise violence. They are calling for violence against us.
[02:04:15.500 --> 02:04:19.260]  But they've whipped themselves into like a feeding frenzy, and it's only going to get worse.
[02:04:19.820 --> 02:04:25.020]  But remember, Tom, too, that the left never operates in good faith. The left never abides
[02:04:25.020 --> 02:04:29.260]  by the rules that they demand other people abide by. The left despises the rule of law.
[02:04:29.260 --> 02:04:33.580]  They have double standards for everything. They are not operating in good faith. So even when
[02:04:33.580 --> 02:04:38.540]  they say they want peace, they commit violence. And let's be clear. They've written more articles
[02:04:38.540 --> 02:04:43.500]  where I've lost lawsuits that didn't even exist. I mean, the levels of lies are just
[02:04:44.060 --> 02:04:47.980]  naturalnews.com. Thank you so much. Here's what the truth is, Mike Adams and Tom Pappert. It feels
[02:04:47.980 --> 02:04:51.580]  so good to know there's so many good men and women out there. That's our real wealth,
[02:04:51.580 --> 02:04:57.580]  this people that are willing to know the truth and stand up for it.
[02:05:21.740 --> 02:05:26.780]  Video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones or David Knight or Owen Schreuer or Paul
[02:05:26.780 --> 02:05:32.540]  Watson band videos. We are building it to be a place where band memes are able to be posted.
[02:05:32.540 --> 02:05:37.900]  And we're a growing list of freedom-loving contributors are able to have a home free
[02:05:37.900 --> 02:05:43.420]  from being shut down, free from being censored, free from being silenced by big tech, the chai
[02:05:43.420 --> 02:05:50.860]  comms, the Hollywood scum, and the globalists. Freedom of speech has a home. It's called Band.Video.
[02:05:50.860 --> 02:06:00.860]  America and the World is fighting back against tyranny at Band.Video.
[02:06:06.220 --> 02:06:12.860]  Well, you've got your diamonds and you've got your pretty clothes
[02:06:12.860 --> 02:06:28.860]  and the chauffeur drives your cars. You let everybody know, but don't play with me because you're playing with fire.
[02:06:28.860 --> 02:06:32.860]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. I'm Alex Jones, your host. Tom Pappert's riding shotgun with us.
[02:06:32.860 --> 02:06:38.860]  What I want to do is just read headlines here with Pappert and get his take on these.
[02:06:38.860 --> 02:06:44.860]  And we're going to play some of these clips coming up next segment because this is all so wild, but it's unfolding.
[02:06:44.860 --> 02:06:52.860]  He's the syndicated talk show host, manages a TV station we're on, and also is written for Big League Politics, but he was correcting me.
[02:06:52.860 --> 02:06:56.860]  And I've seen the site. I visited it. We've covered it. We've linked some of the stories.
[02:06:56.860 --> 02:07:04.860]  I didn't even realize it was your site, National File. So tell people about that.
[02:07:04.860 --> 02:07:08.860]  National File is our brand new website. We've been going for just a few weeks now.
[02:07:08.860 --> 02:07:12.860]  We've got some fantastic writers, some former guys at Breitbart, some former guys from Daily Caller.
[02:07:12.860 --> 02:07:16.860]  We've got writers in South America. We've got writers in Europe. We have one guy who's top secret.
[02:07:16.860 --> 02:07:22.860]  He is actually in China right now, and he's going to be doing a documentary series for us from China over the next six, eight months.
[02:07:22.860 --> 02:07:28.860]  And that's where we have this article. Trump's new social credit gun control scheme is controlled by leftists.
[02:07:28.860 --> 02:07:32.860]  It has all the information, all of the names, all of the documentation.
[02:07:32.860 --> 02:07:36.860]  We cover a lot of things on there. One of our big things is Big Tech, any Big Tech story.
[02:07:36.860 --> 02:07:43.860]  Just yesterday, earlier this week, we had an article about Jen Lowe, who is the Texas State Director of Latinos for Trump.
[02:07:43.860 --> 02:07:50.860]  Banned from Facebook for daring to do an event associated with infowars, daring to go to the straight pride parade in Boston.
[02:07:50.860 --> 02:07:59.860]  Totally perched from the platform. This is a new, insane Lowe, where they're banning people who are amazing, wonderful Latinas from social networking,
[02:07:59.860 --> 02:08:04.860]  because they said something that they don't like. So we're covering all this type of news. We cover Jeffrey Epstein in-depth,
[02:08:04.860 --> 02:08:12.860]  and it's going to be a good source for straight, hard-hitting commentary and straight news about what is happening right now in NationalFile.com.
[02:08:12.860 --> 02:08:14.860]  Thank you, Alex, for letting me do the plug.
[02:08:14.860 --> 02:08:19.860]  Fantastic name. And you're like, hey, can I plug my site in NationalFile? Like, that's yours. You better.
[02:08:19.860 --> 02:08:25.860]  Hey, whether it's with NationalFile.com or Memeworld.com, all these great sites, like Drudge 70 came here years ago.
[02:08:25.860 --> 02:08:30.860]  Everybody's got to get back to websites in your own audio, your own video, your own platforms,
[02:08:30.860 --> 02:08:34.860]  and people have to support those and promote those, because that's how we counter them.
[02:08:34.860 --> 02:08:43.860]  Now, let me go through some headlines here, and then I'm going to go into them in detail, because it's just so crazy.
[02:08:43.860 --> 02:08:51.860]  By the way, none of these are a joke. This is a story by Paul Joseph Watson on infowars.com and newswars.com.
[02:08:51.860 --> 02:09:01.860]  There's actually video of this in the city council. Leftist council members says cleaning feces off Seattle streets where the power washer is racist.
[02:09:01.860 --> 02:09:06.860]  They say there's feces and urine all around the city council and all over the streets. I've been there, it's unbelievable.
[02:09:06.860 --> 02:09:14.860]  But they say it will scare the homeless and others like police spraying fire hoses on black people in the 50s and 60s.
[02:09:14.860 --> 02:09:25.860]  So just like AOC said, cauliflower is racist because it's white. She goes, don't grow cauliflower in New York, grow agave.
[02:09:25.860 --> 02:09:31.860]  Well, that doesn't grow there good. It's all just project on to everything. Oh, you're going to clean poop up. It's racist.
[02:09:31.860 --> 02:09:38.860]  That's crazy. No, it's the whole language. It's nothing but being offended. Microaggressions. Okay, here's another one.
[02:09:38.860 --> 02:09:46.860]  Jesse Smollett lawyers, even if he did lie, police complained for taking him seriously. They actually say that in the filing.
[02:09:46.860 --> 02:09:54.860]  That's up on infowars.com. Tucker Carlson, ever destroying and degrading rural America. Walmart now wants to lecture him about guns.
[02:09:54.860 --> 02:09:56.860]  We're going to play that report at the bottom of the hour.
[02:09:56.860 --> 02:10:03.860]  Trump's time is terrible. London, Menair, Cannes, stay out of our business.
[02:10:03.860 --> 02:10:11.860]  Something good Trump did. Administration just unbanned all those great light bulbs that have been banned by the toxic mercury ones.
[02:10:11.860 --> 02:10:17.860]  Give you a headache. A vegan woman sued her neighbors for barbecuing with her backyard.
[02:10:17.860 --> 02:10:24.860]  USA Today saying it's deliberate. Yes, that's where all this is going. San Francisco's banned fireplaces.
[02:10:24.860 --> 02:10:34.860]  But we'll get more to that. But first this, because Limbaugh's right, we've had like 40-something members of Congress the last three years at a Republican resign.
[02:10:34.860 --> 02:10:45.860]  But let me tell you why. I've had that I know of five different private investigator groups, the New York Times, the Washington Post, Buzzfeed, you name it,
[02:10:45.860 --> 02:11:00.860]  private eyes, hackers, sex ops trying to set me up, people trying to set me up with drugs, you know, Pulitzer Prize winners for the lady that brought down O'Reilly with fake news.
[02:11:00.860 --> 02:11:05.860]  That woman haunt showed a thing for over a year, intimidating, threatening people.
[02:11:05.860 --> 02:11:12.860]  I mean, racketeering stuff by these meteorologists, in my view. And they couldn't get anything. They couldn't make anything up. They couldn't find anything.
[02:11:12.860 --> 02:11:23.860]  So they paid off folks to say that I wear Hitler shoes. And, you know, I mean, just insane crap for 10 grand. That's what the Daily Mail did.
[02:11:23.860 --> 02:11:30.860]  And then we had somebody who was actually in the meetings and recorded the lawyers going, we want you to say he's gay and hit on you.
[02:11:30.860 --> 02:11:38.860]  They said, okay, well, he hit on me, but never actually hit on me, like I said. I never said anything to him, but he felt like it.
[02:11:38.860 --> 02:11:45.860]  So that's what you get paid money for. And then, you know, they tried to say I sent child porn out. No one believes it. It's all eyes.
[02:11:45.860 --> 02:11:49.860]  By the hell would I send child porn to the Sandy Hook families? None of it's true.
[02:11:49.860 --> 02:11:55.860]  So, Limbaugh's come out and said that Republicans are being blackmailed into retirement.
[02:11:55.860 --> 02:12:03.860]  I think the Democrats are finding dirt. Absolutely. And let me tell you, if they can't intimidate you, they start threatening your family.
[02:12:03.860 --> 02:12:12.860]  And then they finance lawsuits against you. You know what people say? Oh, we better bow down. No, we better fight back because these are criminals and they're out of control.
[02:12:12.860 --> 02:12:23.860]  The danger is giving in. The danger is sucking up. The danger is bowing down. All you can do is resist these terrorists because they are terrorists.
[02:12:23.860 --> 02:12:24.860]  Tom Pappert.
[02:12:24.860 --> 02:12:30.860]  Now, you're completely right. And I think the ones who aren't being blackmailed are trying to get out of the system because they know that their goose is cooked.
[02:12:30.860 --> 02:12:35.860]  But this is typical for what leftists do. As you said, it's happened to you countless times at this point.
[02:12:35.860 --> 02:12:38.860]  They are doing everything they can do to destroy you politically.
[02:12:38.860 --> 02:12:44.860]  If you could just imagine, you're a hard target, Alex. You've done nothing wrong in your entire life. You live squeaky clean.
[02:12:44.860 --> 02:12:47.860]  I know this. I've ridden around with you. This is absolute back.
[02:12:47.860 --> 02:12:51.860]  Think of all these Republicans. Think of all the people who get caught in the airport bathroom.
[02:12:51.860 --> 02:12:58.860]  Think of what the money they take. Think of how they brought down great people from the Reagan administration where the Prime Minister in Japan, one of his cronies,
[02:12:58.860 --> 02:13:04.860]  gives you an envelope, you put it in a safe, and then they make the case that you sold out the United States for $1,000.
[02:13:04.860 --> 02:13:08.860]  This is what these people do. And I have no doubt that they're being pressured into retirement.
[02:13:08.860 --> 02:13:14.860]  And I only hope, this is our big opportunity, President Trump needs to go back to campaigning for these people's replacements,
[02:13:14.860 --> 02:13:15.860]  but get out the Trump folks.
[02:13:15.860 --> 02:13:20.860]  Hell, they indicted what four people in Congress in California so they'd make the whole state go blue.
[02:13:20.860 --> 02:13:21.860]  Right.
[02:13:21.860 --> 02:13:26.860]  I mean, they got the gloves off, folks. And you think bending over is going to make it any better? No.
[02:13:26.860 --> 02:13:28.860]  Start swinging politically.
[02:13:28.860 --> 02:13:32.860]  That's right. I mean, we have a president who, with all his flaws, he is a counterpuncher.
[02:13:32.860 --> 02:13:36.860]  He fights back when they tried to get him for Billy Bush in the P-word.
[02:13:36.860 --> 02:13:43.860]  He fought back. He went fire and fury. And that is how we win, that we can't bend over and take it from these people anymore.
[02:13:43.860 --> 02:13:50.860]  That's what we've been doing since the 1960s, and it's time to fight back legally, lawfully, politically, using the media, using our...
[02:13:50.860 --> 02:13:54.860]  Well, America was asleep then. It's awake now. They don't get it.
[02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:55.860]  Right.
[02:13:55.860 --> 02:13:56.860]  What do you say to jerks?
[02:13:56.860 --> 02:14:04.860]  They still think it's the 1950s, and they have their big three networks, and they have the newspapers, and they determine what is true and what Americans will know.
[02:14:04.860 --> 02:14:11.860]  They still believe that. They don't understand that even though you ban Alex Jones from Facebook, that does nothing, nothing to keep people from being awake,
[02:14:11.860 --> 02:14:16.860]  and it creates the opportunity for people to find 5,000 new people who are saying the same exact thing.
[02:14:16.860 --> 02:14:23.860]  You get some out of those platforms, and as long as people keep spreading the word, it outrageous them, it crushes them, it infuriates them.
[02:14:23.860 --> 02:14:32.860]  Your will against them, they want you silenced, but when you support InfoWars, when you spread the links, when you talk about all the other great sites,
[02:14:32.860 --> 02:14:40.860]  like nationalfile.com, or memeworld.com, or Paul's site, that's summit.news, that crushes the enemy.
[02:14:40.860 --> 02:14:47.860]  And I do have to say, Alex, I mean, I've been traveling since Saturday morning. I was in the airport for 14 hours at one point.
[02:14:47.860 --> 02:14:55.860]  This stuff is keeping me going. Super Blue Silver Immune Gargle is the only reason why I'm able to be on the show and not hacking in an airport right now, or in bed training.
[02:14:55.860 --> 02:14:59.860]  By the way, it comes in those one ounce, three ounce, nine ounce.
[02:14:59.860 --> 02:15:00.860]  Perfect.
[02:15:00.860 --> 02:15:09.860]  And it's got the patented stuff that's in the wound gel that's so popular, but we're able to do it at a very low price, and it's my dad's name for it.
[02:15:09.860 --> 02:15:17.860]  Not the best name, but the product is, I'm not kidding, it's just an unbelievable product. Nothing like it. InfoWarsstore.com.
[02:15:17.860 --> 02:15:25.860]  I'm glad you're reminding me to plug some today. You know, this is the last few days to get DNA force plus 50% off and get a free bottle of Carnivore digestive enzyme.
[02:15:25.860 --> 02:15:35.860]  If you don't know how this is the next level probiotic, then believe me, folks, experience it. I'm putting a free bottle in it, so we're going to be able to then reorder it and have it for next year.
[02:15:35.860 --> 02:15:40.860]  But all these products, whether it's ultimate bone broth or whether it's DNA force plus, we're selling out of it.
[02:15:40.860 --> 02:15:44.860]  We won't have more until a few months into next year. InfoWarsstore.com, InfoWarslife.com.
[02:15:44.860 --> 02:15:54.860]  We've launched the new product that goes with rainforest plus chill force. Learn about chill force. It's really special. Chill force.
[02:15:54.860 --> 02:16:00.860]  Finally, there's a way for you to get into the blockchain, the hottest financial sector without all the speculation.
[02:16:00.860 --> 02:16:05.860]  No, enjoy a 27% annualized payment each month without the ups and downs of Bitcoin.
[02:16:05.860 --> 02:16:13.860]  Seen on programs broadcast on Fox Business News, blockchain data centers offer an equipment leasing program in the explosive digital asset marketplace.
[02:16:13.860 --> 02:16:21.860]  Inspired by entrepreneurs who sold picks and shovels during the gold rush, the money is in the mining equipment used to manufacture dozens of critical digital assets.
[02:16:21.860 --> 02:16:32.860]  Non-security IPO or note, blockchain data centers have a proven turnkey equipment sale leaseback program with a 27% annualized lease payment deposited into your bank account each month.

[02:16:47.860 --> 02:16:54.860]  Equipment offer poses a financial risk to owners consult with financial professionals before purchasing not an offer to buy or sell a security which requires an offering document.

[02:18:55.860 --> 02:19:01.860]  Supermail Vitality is already in the top three of our best sellers for the six years we've had it.
[02:19:01.860 --> 02:19:09.860]  It is an award-winning formula produced in Utah by one of the top herbal companies in the nation that we've been private labeling.
[02:19:09.860 --> 02:19:17.860]  It is cold-pressed. It takes at least three times the herbs that are wild-crafted and organic to be able to produce this.
[02:19:17.860 --> 02:19:23.860]  It's not boiled. It's not heated. It's never been dried. It's taken from fresh herbs.
[02:19:23.860 --> 02:19:29.860]  That's why it's so strong. That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina and energy.
[02:19:29.860 --> 02:19:43.860]  And I'm so excited about Supermail Vitality and Carnivore 30 that I'm offering you with every order of Supermail Vitality at 25% off a free bottle of Carnivore digestive enzyme.

[02:19:59.860 --> 02:20:06.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:20:06.860 --> 02:20:22.860]  Let's get started.
[02:20:22.860 --> 02:20:37.860]  It's amazing the camaraderie and what we've all, the listeners, the viewers, the affiliates, the sponsors, the crew. We really are a family. We really are people who just want justice. We just want a pro-human future.
[02:20:37.860 --> 02:20:45.860]  And people are really now seeing how evil the globalists are. And they're exactly what I said they were because, folks, this has all been documented and admitted for a long time.
[02:20:45.860 --> 02:20:54.860]  So of course it sounded crazy. But if you look at elites throughout history, they always get in their own bubbles and they have all these sycophants around them and they go nuts.
[02:20:54.860 --> 02:21:01.860]  Or if the kings or elites aren't crazy, other sycophants will remove them and that's how you get this concentration of evil.
[02:21:01.860 --> 02:21:07.860]  No, you're exactly right about that. And you were saying it last night, this is what empires look like when they're about to crumble.
[02:21:07.860 --> 02:21:12.860]  And President Trump is the one thing that is attempting to keep that from happening, but they're rubbing it in our faces.
[02:21:12.860 --> 02:21:25.860]  We had an article up, we broke this in nationalfile.com, that DeVos, as in the Trump administration, DeVos, her son, holds a group that is doing drag syndrome, where they're doing down syndrome drag queens.
[02:21:25.860 --> 02:21:33.860]  They are rubbing this filth in our face, normalizing, abusing not only children at this point, but those who have mental disabilities.
[02:21:33.860 --> 02:21:40.860]  It is absolute and total insanity. They're rubbing it in our face. It is sick. It is evil. And again, it's going to do one of two things.
[02:21:40.860 --> 02:21:44.860]  It's going to destroy what's left of this country or it's going to wake everybody the hell up.
[02:21:44.860 --> 02:21:53.860]  I was told by Ted Gunnerson, who'd been the head of the LA sector. That's one of the top 10 FBI positions in the country.
[02:21:53.860 --> 02:22:00.860]  He said they love to have sex with down syndrome kids because then people don't believe them.
[02:22:00.860 --> 02:22:03.860]  And he talked about the devil worshipers and of course it's all come out now.
[02:22:03.860 --> 02:22:13.860]  And even they've had academics in England and Australia come out and say, listen, almost 30% of the quote trans kids are actually mentally retarded or autistic.
[02:22:13.860 --> 02:22:19.860]  And the schools are telling them you're this. And the argument is, well, they're subhuman. We want them sterilized.
[02:22:19.860 --> 02:22:23.860]  And really, this is getting people to opt in to be sterilized. That's really all that says.
[02:22:23.860 --> 02:22:25.860]  Which is absolutely horrifying and disgusting.
[02:22:25.860 --> 02:22:32.860]  And meanwhile, as we were talking about with Mike Adams earlier, they're fueling population growth in areas of the world that cannot sustain it.
[02:22:32.860 --> 02:22:39.860]  And they are destroying it here in the United States with these people who are on the autism spectrum, which we know is not organic either.
[02:22:39.860 --> 02:22:51.860]  Unbelievable. I've got so much to hit here. But I want to get into what else is on your radar screen because all I could say is we're at a historic moment.
[02:22:51.860 --> 02:22:57.860]  And everything we do now echoes throughout eternity with a thousand times what it normally does historically at every expert agrees.
[02:22:57.860 --> 02:23:03.860]  Everyone can feel it. We're at a critical unfrozen point. Even engineers, social engineers call it an unfreezing.
[02:23:03.860 --> 02:23:12.860]  When they bring us into a revolutionary period so they can make all their big changes, we're able to go in and actually reverse that and actually move forward with our progressivism.
[02:23:12.860 --> 02:23:15.860]  They call themselves progressive. They progress like cancer.
[02:23:15.860 --> 02:23:22.860]  You're absolutely right. Well, the things that are on my radar right now in my hometown of Wichita, Kansas, there's currently an ongoing debate now.
[02:23:22.860 --> 02:23:29.860]  I'm sure you've covered this, but I'm going to be at this thing. So help me God to peacefully. I want to document this peacefully, lawfully, etc.
[02:23:29.860 --> 02:23:37.860]  They are now debating whether or not it is okay to have to do a background check of the drag queen story, our talent.
[02:23:37.860 --> 02:23:43.860]  In other words, like here in Texas, they found multiple instances of them being child rapists.
[02:23:43.860 --> 02:23:46.860]  Well, we're not allowed to find that out in Wichita because that might be homophobic.
[02:23:46.860 --> 02:23:49.860]  So that's the next thing that I'm going to be doing in the 3D physical world.
[02:23:49.860 --> 02:23:54.860]  So everybody else has got to have a background check, but no, they don't.
[02:23:54.860 --> 02:23:58.860]  Big fat men in clown outfits that say, quote, we're here to groom your children.
[02:23:58.860 --> 02:23:59.860]  That's right.
[02:23:59.860 --> 02:24:03.860]  Can't tell us who they are, though, even though these guys is a convicted ax murderer on screen.
[02:24:03.860 --> 02:24:07.860]  Chopped his boyfriend up and he says, bring your kids to me. I'm going to corrupt them.
[02:24:07.860 --> 02:24:12.860]  They've stated admitted that is our agenda. We want to indoctrinate the next generation.
[02:24:12.860 --> 02:24:16.860]  This is what comes out of their mouths. We're not making this up. This is not hyperbolic.
[02:24:16.860 --> 02:24:21.860]  And again, this is a library where the people who work there have to pass a background check.
[02:24:21.860 --> 02:24:23.860]  The people who go there have to pass a background check.
[02:24:23.860 --> 02:24:26.860]  Is this in the news? They're openly saying, don't make the drag queens.
[02:24:26.860 --> 02:24:31.860]  Don't make the clown men that want to groom your children and tell you who they are.
[02:24:31.860 --> 02:24:33.860]  That's exactly right. It's in the Wichita Eagle. They're debating it.
[02:24:33.860 --> 02:24:38.860]  Whether or not it's okay to do a background check on these people who are going to have contact with your children.
[02:24:38.860 --> 02:24:39.860]  Come sit on my lap.
[02:24:39.860 --> 02:24:47.860]  You run their plates. We followed some of them and got them busted that they know now. Two of them in Houston got busted.
[02:24:47.860 --> 02:24:52.860]  All you do is you just follow them, run their plates.
[02:24:52.860 --> 02:24:59.860]  And then all you got to do is also, they get on a bus and they get off in disguise.
[02:24:59.860 --> 02:25:01.860]  They're actually out of their events. They dress up like women.
[02:25:01.860 --> 02:25:04.860]  But this is clowned even if it's to scare the kids that get off on it.
[02:25:04.860 --> 02:25:07.860]  But it also covers like masked men. It's hit the clown.
[02:25:07.860 --> 02:25:11.860]  And then you just follow them and then follow where they live, then you still burn them.
[02:25:11.860 --> 02:25:13.860]  Right, right. And of course you do all that.
[02:25:13.860 --> 02:25:17.860]  You're not talking about doing anything bad. I want to be very clear here, Wichita Police Department.
[02:25:17.860 --> 02:25:19.860]  We're not talking about doing anything illegal or unlawful.
[02:25:19.860 --> 02:25:22.860]  No, no. You use PI firms that are licensed.
[02:25:22.860 --> 02:25:23.860]  Exactly.
[02:25:23.860 --> 02:25:24.860]  Exactly.
[02:25:24.860 --> 02:25:27.860]  And so I'm telling you, get donations on your station whenever.
[02:25:27.860 --> 02:25:31.860]  Pay for some good PIs and I guarantee you're going to net PEDOS. They are PEDOS.
[02:25:31.860 --> 02:25:35.860]  Oh, absolutely. Who the hell else has this inclination? I want to dress up like a woman.
[02:25:35.860 --> 02:25:38.860]  I mean, Alex, could you imagine wearing a dress and reading to a three-year-old?
[02:25:38.860 --> 02:25:41.860]  But it's all more and more. Now they ride horsey.
[02:25:41.860 --> 02:25:44.860]  The men get erections and the little kids bounce up and down.
[02:25:44.860 --> 02:25:48.860]  And the mothers just start to just, it's an evil of it. Totally excites them.
[02:25:48.860 --> 02:25:50.860]  Well, and they're giving tips.
[02:25:50.860 --> 02:25:54.860]  They all have names like Sally Fishpants. They all squat and talk about shaking their booties
[02:25:54.860 --> 02:26:00.860]  and spread their legs to the kids. I mean, this is, this is, they all hump and teach the kids how to hump.
[02:26:00.860 --> 02:26:03.860]  Well, Alex, one of the things I asked, this is the left. This is who they are.
[02:26:03.860 --> 02:26:05.860]  That's right. And one of the things I asked myself is, how did we get here?
[02:26:05.860 --> 02:26:08.860]  You know, we want to give, we want to stop beating up the LGBTQ population.
[02:26:08.860 --> 02:26:11.860]  Yes, I'm with you. I do know, and anybody to be beat up for it.
[02:26:11.860 --> 02:26:12.860]  That's all, that's like, super rare.
[02:26:12.860 --> 02:26:15.860]  It's, it's, it's very, it never happens anymore. Then you get to marriage.
[02:26:15.860 --> 02:26:18.860]  It's like, okay, that's not Christian, but whatever. We'll let you have it, I guess.
[02:26:18.860 --> 02:26:19.860]  If that, you'll leave it.
[02:26:19.860 --> 02:26:20.860]  Now they're like, give us your kids.
[02:26:20.860 --> 02:26:24.860]  That's right. It's escalated in the span of what, 50, 60 years to give us your children.
[02:26:24.860 --> 02:26:26.860]  We're going to read to them. We're going to indoctrinate them.
[02:26:26.860 --> 02:26:33.860]  We're going to put them on chemical castration. And if you don't like it, then you hate the LGBT community.
[02:26:33.860 --> 02:26:36.860]  Oh, there it is. Drag queen backlash. Would you tell legal, would you tell a library of men?
[02:26:36.860 --> 02:26:43.860]  Sex offender checks on story readers. Oh, oh, the poor babies.
[02:26:43.860 --> 02:26:46.860]  They're the true people we need. And this is such a business.
[02:26:46.860 --> 02:26:48.860]  Are you going to take a camera crew? Because I want to see this.
[02:26:48.860 --> 02:26:50.860]  Oh, absolutely. We're going to, if it's not a camera crew.
[02:26:50.860 --> 02:26:51.860]  When is this?
[02:26:51.860 --> 02:26:53.860]  This is, they do these every few months.
[02:26:53.860 --> 02:26:54.860]  But when's the next one?
[02:26:54.860 --> 02:26:57.860]  I think it's going to be shortly after I get back in this month.
[02:26:57.860 --> 02:26:58.860]  So we're going to be filming it.
[02:26:58.860 --> 02:27:03.860]  We're going to have, I'll probably be going live because I can still do that for now to Facebook and other social media.
[02:27:03.860 --> 02:27:08.860]  And I want to go extremely low profile so they don't, you know, see me coming a mile away and bring it up.
[02:27:08.860 --> 02:27:13.860]  Oh, it's so evil that you want to go see what men in clown outfits are doing with children.
[02:27:13.860 --> 02:27:18.860]  Have you heard the new book published in the U.S. by Obama official?
[02:27:18.860 --> 02:27:26.860]  And Australia, who's been freaked out about it, I can't even say on air on TV stations radio what they, this is for kids.
[02:27:26.860 --> 02:27:34.860]  And it's a book teaching children that if a man wants to have sex with you in a park or get in a car with them, how much it's kids stories.
[02:27:34.860 --> 02:27:38.860]  What's written by how great it was when they're six, when the man had sex with them.
[02:27:38.860 --> 02:27:43.860]  So it's giving children home erotic fantasies on how to be kidnapped.
[02:27:43.860 --> 02:27:44.860]  That is horrifying.
[02:27:44.860 --> 02:27:45.860]  Oh, it's liberal.
[02:27:45.860 --> 02:27:47.860]  And I'm so liberated to be tied up the back of that van.
[02:27:47.860 --> 02:27:52.860]  And I'm sure it's going to be taken to the house with the other kids in cages begging for mommy.
[02:27:52.860 --> 02:27:54.860]  That is so disgusting.
[02:27:54.860 --> 02:27:55.860]  Liberal though.
[02:27:55.860 --> 02:27:57.860]  You'll float too.
[02:27:57.860 --> 02:27:58.860]  It's progressive.
[02:27:58.860 --> 02:28:00.860]  Come on over here, judgey.
[02:28:00.860 --> 02:28:01.860]  It's our future.
[02:28:01.860 --> 02:28:04.860]  And that, this is such a concerted effort.
[02:28:04.860 --> 02:28:05.860]  You can't tell me this.
[02:28:05.860 --> 02:28:06.860]  Oh, it's all over the world.
[02:28:06.860 --> 02:28:08.860]  It's a total attack pattern.
[02:28:08.860 --> 02:28:12.860]  The only place they're not doing this are in third world nations where again they're trying to.
[02:28:12.860 --> 02:28:13.860]  And what is it the clown do?
[02:28:13.860 --> 02:28:17.860]  It's a fallen intergalactic spider creature.
[02:28:17.860 --> 02:28:19.860]  It's angler antenna is just a clown.
[02:28:19.860 --> 02:28:20.860]  Right.
[02:28:20.860 --> 02:28:25.860]  And it goes out to suck the energy of the fear from the children to psychic vampire.
[02:28:25.860 --> 02:28:28.860]  And in reality, the devil worshipers are doing just that.
[02:28:28.860 --> 02:28:31.860]  Stephen King knows of what he speaks.
[02:28:31.860 --> 02:28:33.860]  Don't you, Stephen?
[02:28:33.860 --> 02:28:34.860]  Absolutely right.
[02:28:34.860 --> 02:28:36.860]  Oh, Stephen doesn't like this show.
[02:28:36.860 --> 02:28:38.860]  And we're glad you don't, Mr. King.
[02:28:38.860 --> 02:28:41.860]  Well, he's busy writing another book about a child or so.
[02:28:41.860 --> 02:28:43.860]  We don't need him.
[02:28:43.860 --> 02:28:44.860]  Yeah, old Stephen.
[02:28:44.860 --> 02:28:46.860]  How you doing, Stephen?
[02:28:46.860 --> 02:28:47.860]  Hey, great job, Pepper.
[02:28:47.860 --> 02:28:48.860]  He really appreciates her.
[02:28:48.860 --> 02:28:51.860]  Shouldn't I say, how you doing, Mr. Lott?
[02:28:51.860 --> 02:28:52.860]  Thanks, sir.
[02:28:52.860 --> 02:28:53.860]  Great job.
[02:28:53.860 --> 02:29:19.860]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:29:23.860 --> 02:29:49.860]  Thank you.
[02:29:49.860 --> 02:29:56.860]  And that's why we're introducing what we know is going to be a massive bestseller,
[02:29:56.860 --> 02:29:57.860]  Chilforce.
[02:29:57.860 --> 02:30:00.860]  Now, let's look at what's in this powerful formula.
[02:30:00.860 --> 02:30:06.860]  Ashwagandha root extract, an ancient medicinal herb used for over 3,000 years treats stress
[02:30:06.860 --> 02:30:07.860]  and relax the patient.
[02:30:07.860 --> 02:30:11.860]  L-theanine, a special amino acid naturally found in some tea leaves.
[02:30:11.860 --> 02:30:15.860]  The compound has been called the stress killer because of its powerful relaxation
[02:30:15.860 --> 02:30:20.860]  benefits, GABA, an important neurotransmitter that controls functions of the body and mind,
[02:30:20.860 --> 02:30:22.860]  including nervous system relaxation.
[02:30:22.860 --> 02:30:25.860]  GABA is a choice for many to help reduce anxiety.
[02:30:25.860 --> 02:30:30.860]  Rodiola rosea root extract found in the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.
[02:30:30.860 --> 02:30:35.860]  This root is considered a super adaptogen and is believed to help the body in the fight
[02:30:35.860 --> 02:30:38.860]  against emotional, mental and physical stress.
[02:30:38.860 --> 02:30:42.860]  It's time to do what I did and take action with the Chilforce treatment.
[02:30:42.860 --> 02:30:47.860]  It's time to do what I did and take action with the Chilforce challenge at M4sLive.com.
[02:31:13.860 --> 02:31:18.860]  L-of-ATP, a patented one-of-a-kind compound has been clinically shown to increase ATP
[02:31:18.860 --> 02:31:21.860]  and support improved strength, power and performance in athletes.
[02:31:21.860 --> 02:31:26.860]  PQQ, over 1,000 studies have been published on its health benefits from enhancement in short-term memory
[02:31:26.860 --> 02:31:28.860]  to improved energy and metabolism.
[02:31:28.860 --> 02:31:32.860]  Cordycepsinensis, it is thought to be one of the most powerful adaptogens available.
[02:31:32.860 --> 02:31:37.860]  Coenzyme Q10, found in every human cell, CoQ10 plays a key role in heart health,
[02:31:37.860 --> 02:31:39.860]  brain health and even helps protect DNA.

[02:31:57.860 --> 02:32:02.860]  I've been so busy, I haven't talked about it because I've been covering news, but it's very exciting.
[02:32:02.860 --> 02:32:04.860]  It's super silver skin cream.
[02:32:04.860 --> 02:32:09.860]  It's got all of these benefits, too many to mention, but it's revolutionary, it's brand new.

[02:32:20.860 --> 02:32:24.860]  Super silver skin cream is infused with patented silver salt technology
[02:32:24.860 --> 02:32:29.860]  that's used by top hospitals and health clinics to kill off everything from MRSA to Candida fungus.

[02:32:54.860 --> 02:32:59.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[02:33:12.860 --> 02:33:16.860]  Waging war on corruption, it's Alex Jones.
[02:33:16.860 --> 02:33:21.860]  Shunning these people.
[02:33:21.860 --> 02:33:26.860]  Shunning, shaming these people is a statement of moral indignation
[02:33:26.860 --> 02:33:29.860]  that these people are not fit for polite society.
[02:33:29.860 --> 02:33:32.860]  I'm going to try to take everything away from you.
[02:33:32.860 --> 02:33:33.860]  And I don't care what I find out.
[02:33:33.860 --> 02:33:36.860]  It could be today, tomorrow, 15, 20 years from now.
[02:33:36.860 --> 02:33:39.860]  If I find out, you're fucking the finished.
[02:33:39.860 --> 02:33:41.860]  They don't get to escape accountability.
[02:33:41.860 --> 02:33:45.860]  That's all of our job to hold them accountable for the rest of their lives.
[02:33:45.860 --> 02:33:47.860]  That's so entertaining.
[02:34:15.860 --> 02:34:18.860]  Big pharma, the people that bring us Ritalin and Prozac
[02:34:18.860 --> 02:34:26.860]  and things like Luvox and deadly opiates like Hillbilly, heroin, oxy-cotton
[02:34:26.860 --> 02:34:33.860]  that work so hard to try to shut down burgeoning health food and vitamin stores across the country.
[02:34:33.860 --> 02:34:38.860]  But thanks to people like Mel Gibson who took action in the ad you're about to see,
[02:34:38.860 --> 02:34:44.860]  America mobilized and we were able to retain some of our basic rights
[02:34:44.860 --> 02:34:49.860]  to be able to take vitamins and minerals and things from evil mother nature.
[02:35:14.860 --> 02:35:24.860]  It's free. Hey, guys, got it. It's only vitamins.
[02:35:28.860 --> 02:35:33.860]  The federal government is actually considering classifying us a lot of us out of some of us as drugs
[02:35:33.860 --> 02:35:36.860]  and confiscating them and rating your businesses your homes.
[02:35:36.860 --> 02:35:39.860]  They tried it in the early 90s. They're trying it again.
[02:35:39.860 --> 02:35:43.860]  Vitamin C, you know, like in oranges.
[02:35:43.860 --> 02:35:46.860]  If you don't want to lose your vitamins, make the FDA stop.
[02:35:46.860 --> 02:35:50.860]  Call the U.S. Senate and tell them that you want to take your vitamins in peace.
[02:35:50.860 --> 02:35:53.860]  If enough of us do that, it'll work.
[02:36:00.860 --> 02:36:04.860]  There have been hundreds and hundreds of articles written in the last year
[02:36:04.860 --> 02:36:07.860]  demonizing myself, Joe Rogan, Ben Shapiro and others
[02:36:07.860 --> 02:36:11.860]  because we dare to sell high-quality supplements.
[02:36:11.860 --> 02:36:18.860]  Now, it's okay when Whole Foods or grocery store chains sell basically the exact same things.
[02:36:18.860 --> 02:36:23.860]  But when we do, it's evil and it's bad because we're patriots and we're nationalists.
[02:36:23.860 --> 02:36:28.860]  But you see, they're really upset because they know that new tropics and other supplements sell
[02:36:28.860 --> 02:36:32.860]  because people are reporting they're getting great results.
[02:36:32.860 --> 02:36:38.860]  Well, I've got a new evil to announce the world that they can write hundreds of other articles about.
[02:36:38.860 --> 02:36:44.860]  It's the sister, or you could say the brother, the kissing cousin of Rain Force Plus,
[02:36:44.860 --> 02:36:47.860]  our number one overall bestseller.
[02:36:47.860 --> 02:36:53.860]  A new tropic that people absolutely love because we get the best, purest, high-quality ingredients
[02:36:53.860 --> 02:36:59.860]  that are tested and proven to blow people's expectations away.
[02:36:59.860 --> 02:37:03.860]  Now, it gives you a lot of sustained focus energy without the crash.
[02:37:03.860 --> 02:37:10.860]  But a lot of people want a way that after they've been turbocharged for 10 hours with just two capsules
[02:37:10.860 --> 02:37:15.860]  to be able to not to come down, but just smooth out and be chill.
[02:37:15.860 --> 02:37:20.860]  And that's why we're introducing what we know is going to be a massive bestseller, Chill Force.
[02:37:20.860 --> 02:37:24.860]  I want to be clear, Chill Force is not like knockout meant to make you go to sleep.
[02:37:24.860 --> 02:37:27.860]  It's simply meant to relax you but still have clarity.
[02:37:27.860 --> 02:37:30.860]  That's why a lot of people aren't just taking it after their days over.
[02:37:30.860 --> 02:37:36.860]  They're taking it with things like Rain Force Plus and, of course, Turbo Force.
[02:37:36.860 --> 02:37:41.860]  It's time to do what I did and take action with the Chill Force Challenge at M4sLive.com.
[02:37:50.860 --> 02:37:53.860]  Freeway Rick Ross has gotten me a good friend of mine.
[02:37:53.860 --> 02:37:57.860]  He's been on the show many times over the years, usually in studio.
[02:37:57.860 --> 02:38:01.860]  And we're going to have him with us halfway to the next hour that Matt Bracken takes over.
[02:38:01.860 --> 02:38:04.860]  He's drove down to Dallas, got stuck in some traffic, but better late than never.
[02:38:04.860 --> 02:38:06.860]  FreewayRickRoss.com.
[02:38:06.860 --> 02:38:10.860]  He's one of the biggest cocaine kingpins ever busted in this country.
[02:38:10.860 --> 02:38:12.860]  And then it turned out he was working for the CIA.
[02:38:12.860 --> 02:38:14.860]  That's all declassified.
[02:38:14.860 --> 02:38:15.860]  That's all admitted.
[02:38:15.860 --> 02:38:18.860]  And Gary Webb, who got shot twice at the back of the head of the shotgun,
[02:38:18.860 --> 02:38:21.860]  he had his new book coming out that was going to vindicate him.
[02:38:21.860 --> 02:38:23.860]  Well, he got killed.
[02:38:23.860 --> 02:38:28.860]  The film came out a few years ago and killed a messenger and I actually got physically sick watching it
[02:38:28.860 --> 02:38:32.860]  because I knew Gary Webb and I knew how accurate the film was.
[02:38:32.860 --> 02:38:34.860]  It blew me away.
[02:38:34.860 --> 02:38:58.860]  Here's the trailer for Kill the Messenger.
[02:39:05.860 --> 02:39:07.860]  Does that not sound strange to you?
[02:39:07.860 --> 02:39:09.860]  I'm going to tell you the whole truth.
[02:39:09.860 --> 02:39:11.860]  I'm going to introduce you to people you should talk to.
[02:39:11.860 --> 02:39:14.860]  And then you will be faced with the most important decision of your life.
[02:39:14.860 --> 02:39:16.860]  Oh yeah? What's that?
[02:39:16.860 --> 02:39:18.860]  Deciding whether to share it or not.
[02:39:18.860 --> 02:39:20.860]  One of the DEA's most wanted.
[02:39:20.860 --> 02:39:23.860]  Brought in thousands of kilos of cocaine to the U.S. every day.
[02:39:23.860 --> 02:39:24.860]  For them.
[02:39:24.860 --> 02:39:25.860]  For who?
[02:39:25.860 --> 02:39:26.860]  The U.S. government.
[02:39:26.860 --> 02:39:27.860]  Or with them.
[02:39:27.860 --> 02:39:29.860]  Or at least while they were looking the other way.
[02:39:29.860 --> 02:39:30.860]  Jesus.
[02:39:30.860 --> 02:39:35.860]  I knew you all could land it. I couldn't sell it fast enough to keep it with supply.
[02:39:35.860 --> 02:39:37.860]  That's the information you have there.
[02:39:40.860 --> 02:39:42.860]  Dangerous.
[02:39:42.860 --> 02:39:45.860]  What you found here, Gary, is a monster.
[02:39:45.860 --> 02:39:48.860]  You have no idea what you're getting into.
[02:39:48.860 --> 02:39:50.860]  You really tell me that I should just walk away from this?
[02:39:50.860 --> 02:39:52.860]  You'd be an idiot not to.
[02:39:52.860 --> 02:39:54.860]  This story scares people.
[02:39:54.860 --> 02:39:55.860]  I'm your big brother.
[02:39:55.860 --> 02:39:56.860]  Well, it should.
[02:39:56.860 --> 02:39:59.860]  I can't help it.
[02:39:59.860 --> 02:40:03.860]  There are ongoing operations here in danger of exposing.
[02:40:03.860 --> 02:40:05.860]  We know you were in Nicaragua.
[02:40:05.860 --> 02:40:07.860]  Am I being followed?
[02:40:14.860 --> 02:40:19.860]  I thought my job was to tell the public the truth, the facts, pretty or not.
[02:40:19.860 --> 02:40:22.860]  And let the publishing of those facts make a difference.
[02:40:22.860 --> 02:40:26.860]  And now people look at things, at themselves, at what they stand for.
[02:40:26.860 --> 02:40:29.860]  We'd never threaten your children, Mr. Wilde.
[02:40:31.860 --> 02:40:32.860]  What'd you say?
[02:40:35.860 --> 02:40:36.860]  It's over.
[02:40:36.860 --> 02:40:38.860]  I'm not finished with it!
[02:40:38.860 --> 02:40:39.860]  I'm not finished!
[02:40:39.860 --> 02:40:40.860]  This is a true story.
[02:40:40.860 --> 02:40:42.860]  Some stories are just too true to tell.
[02:40:47.860 --> 02:40:48.860]  Kill the messenger.
[02:40:48.860 --> 02:40:49.860]  And this thing goes so deep.
[02:40:49.860 --> 02:40:51.860]  The real Rick Ross is here.
[02:40:51.860 --> 02:40:55.860]  There was a big fat jail guard who basically stole his identity
[02:40:55.860 --> 02:40:57.860]  and then said he was the kingpin.
[02:40:57.860 --> 02:40:59.860]  But Rick Ross is a really nice guy.
[02:40:59.860 --> 02:41:01.860]  He can tell you how he got into it.
[02:41:01.860 --> 02:41:04.860]  So he didn't know why he was the biggest coke dealer in the United States
[02:41:04.860 --> 02:41:06.860]  because the CIA was delivering it to him.
[02:41:06.860 --> 02:41:07.860]  But it's good to see you again.
[02:41:07.860 --> 02:41:10.860]  It's been about a year or two since you've been in here.
[02:41:10.860 --> 02:41:12.860]  What are we going to hit on when we come back?
[02:41:12.860 --> 02:41:14.860]  Because we never scripted any of this.
[02:41:14.860 --> 02:41:17.860]  Some of the stuff that I'm doing now.
[02:41:17.860 --> 02:41:24.860]  We've just been about two or three years since we last interviewed.
[02:41:24.860 --> 02:41:25.860]  A lot's happening.
[02:41:25.860 --> 02:41:27.860]  And for those that don't know though, we'll recap your story as well.
[02:41:27.860 --> 02:41:28.860]  Yeah, we can do that.
[02:41:28.860 --> 02:41:29.860]  We can recap.
[02:41:29.860 --> 02:41:30.860]  What was it like watching Kill the Messenger?
[02:41:30.860 --> 02:41:33.860]  Because, you know, I'd interviewed you some and I knew Gary pretty good.
[02:41:33.860 --> 02:41:34.860]  We were to build a website together.
[02:41:34.860 --> 02:41:35.860]  He'd been on the show a lot.
[02:41:35.860 --> 02:41:37.860]  And then all of a sudden he was executed.
[02:41:37.860 --> 02:41:39.860]  And he was really excited before he died.
[02:41:39.860 --> 02:41:40.860]  He had this big book coming out.
[02:41:40.860 --> 02:41:42.860]  Because the book never came out though.
[02:41:42.860 --> 02:41:48.860]  I spoke to him about a month or two before he got killed or died or whatever.
[02:41:48.860 --> 02:41:49.860]  Got abstained?
[02:41:49.860 --> 02:41:50.860]  Yeah.
[02:41:50.860 --> 02:41:51.860]  I don't know what happened.
[02:41:51.860 --> 02:41:55.860]  I was also working at that time, you know, Kevin Booth, a friend of mine, yours.
[02:41:55.860 --> 02:41:59.860]  He was doing a documentary called The Great White Hope.
[02:41:59.860 --> 02:42:03.860]  And he's the one that told me the first time that Gary had gotten killed.
[02:42:03.860 --> 02:42:06.860]  Or that he was dead, committed suicide.
[02:42:06.860 --> 02:42:07.860]  I don't know which one.
[02:42:07.860 --> 02:42:09.860]  The police say two gunshots pretty normal.
[02:42:09.860 --> 02:42:10.860]  Shoot yourself twice in the head.
[02:42:10.860 --> 02:42:13.860]  Yeah, that's what they had a doctor to say that.
[02:42:13.860 --> 02:42:15.860]  If I ever get shot twice in the head, it wasn't me.
[02:42:15.860 --> 02:42:17.860]  If I get shot once in the head, it wasn't me.
[02:42:17.860 --> 02:42:20.860]  Remember when you interviewed me in jail, that's what you asked me.
[02:42:20.860 --> 02:42:24.860]  You know, one of the first things you asked me, you were like, Rick, how do you feel?
[02:42:24.860 --> 02:42:26.860]  And I was like, what do you mean?
[02:42:26.860 --> 02:42:28.860]  And I was trying to figure out what you was getting at.
[02:42:28.860 --> 02:42:31.860]  And then you was like, you don't feel suicidal, do you?
[02:42:31.860 --> 02:42:33.860]  And I was like, hell no.
[02:42:33.860 --> 02:42:35.860]  I'm enjoying life, even though I'm in prison.
[02:42:35.860 --> 02:42:36.860]  I still like life.
[02:42:36.860 --> 02:42:41.860]  And you was like, oh, I just wanted to check and make sure, you know, we don't want nothing to happen to you in there.
[02:42:41.860 --> 02:42:45.860]  Hey man, they threaten to kill me all the time.
[02:42:45.860 --> 02:42:50.860]  This is the real Rick Ross in studio, Infowars.com, tomorrow's news today.
[02:43:16.860 --> 02:43:17.860]  It's not boiled.
[02:43:17.860 --> 02:43:18.860]  It's not heated.
[02:43:18.860 --> 02:43:19.860]  It's never been dried.
[02:43:19.860 --> 02:43:21.860]  It's taken from fresh herbs.
[02:43:21.860 --> 02:43:24.860]  That's why it's so strong.
[02:43:24.860 --> 02:43:28.860]  That's why it's so effective for libido, stamina, and energy.

[02:47:09.860 --> 02:47:12.860]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:47:12.860 --> 02:47:18.860]  We're live Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central. Now we've got the David Knight Show kicking about 8 a.m. to 11 a.m.
[02:47:18.860 --> 02:47:22.860]  The War Room, 3 p.m. every day with Owen Schreuer, and we're here.
[02:47:22.860 --> 02:47:28.860]  30 minutes to the next hour, and then 30 minutes popping in Matt Bracken and all the big geopolitical developments.
[02:47:28.860 --> 02:47:31.860]  Riding with Rick, the 21 T's of success.
[02:47:31.860 --> 02:47:35.860]  Rick Ross, new book. Find the book at FreewayRickRoss.com.
[02:47:35.860 --> 02:47:39.860]  A lot of big films made about what happened to him. A lot of big documentaries.
[02:47:39.860 --> 02:47:44.860]  But I always like you to be able to hear it directly from the individual's mouth himself.
[02:47:44.860 --> 02:47:49.860]  So we'll get more into things that are currently happening, fentanyl, the drug wars.
[02:47:49.860 --> 02:47:51.860]  All of it with Rick Ross here.
[02:47:51.860 --> 02:47:57.860]  But again, he was good friends with Gary Webb, who was an award-winning journalist, absolutely vindicated.
[02:47:57.860 --> 02:48:03.860]  Who was executed, assassinated, because he had a book coming out vindicating everything he'd said.
[02:48:03.860 --> 02:48:07.860]  They tried to assassinate his character, broke in his house, threatened him.
[02:48:07.860 --> 02:48:10.860]  That was all on record. He was so excited to get ready to come on the show.
[02:48:10.860 --> 02:48:16.860]  His book was coming out in a month. He'd sent me a CD with all his info to put up a website, and they killed him.
[02:48:16.860 --> 02:48:20.860]  They even saw men climbing down the, climbing out of his house a month before.
[02:48:20.860 --> 02:48:23.860]  He even moved, because they kept breaking in his house.
[02:48:23.860 --> 02:48:26.860]  Like a couple commandos spilling out and climbing down the side of the house.
[02:48:26.860 --> 02:48:31.860]  And then his good friends came out and said, oh no, he committed suicide.
[02:48:31.860 --> 02:48:34.860]  Those are the type of friends you don't need.
[02:48:34.860 --> 02:48:40.860]  But Rick Ross is here with us. Recap what happened to you and the hypocrisy of it.
[02:48:40.860 --> 02:48:46.860]  And again, I don't like illegal drugs. I don't like drug dealing because of all the stuff that goes with it and happens with it.
[02:48:46.860 --> 02:48:52.860]  But my great, great, great grandfather was one of the first cocaine dealers in the United States.
[02:48:52.860 --> 02:48:57.860]  He helped invent Dr. Pepper in Temple, Texas. His last name was Gresham.
[02:48:57.860 --> 02:49:00.860]  And of course his ancestors started Texas, but he was a good guy.
[02:49:00.860 --> 02:49:04.860]  But Dr. Pepper was the first soda drink to be mass distributed.
[02:49:04.860 --> 02:49:10.860]  And he invented the name. It was the drugstore apothecary that actually developed.
[02:49:10.860 --> 02:49:12.860]  It was his favorite. And they said, well, what do you name it, Dr. Pepper?
[02:49:12.860 --> 02:49:16.860]  And then he ran the first ads, then they had the big bottling thing up in Temple.
[02:49:16.860 --> 02:49:18.860]  A little bit of lore you'll never get.
[02:49:18.860 --> 02:49:24.860]  But my point is, big pharma with all the Hillbilly heroin and the Ritalin for kids.
[02:49:24.860 --> 02:49:26.860]  I mean, really, they're the bigger drug dealers than you ever were.
[02:49:26.860 --> 02:49:32.860]  Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. I mean, even like you just saying now with the opioids addiction,
[02:49:32.860 --> 02:49:36.860]  you know, all the doctors who've been prescribing people, Dennis,
[02:49:36.860 --> 02:49:42.860]  who's been prescribing people opioids and got us hooked on opioids right now, you know.
[02:49:42.860 --> 02:49:46.860]  It's crazy, you know, the epidemic that we're going through right now.
[02:49:46.860 --> 02:49:48.860]  And it's worked in the cocaine epidemic.
[02:49:48.860 --> 02:49:52.860]  Tell people briefly your story, how you got into it.
[02:49:52.860 --> 02:49:54.860]  I remember you described as like suddenly boom, you're a giant drug dealer.
[02:49:54.860 --> 02:50:00.860]  Yeah, yeah, I started off when I started, I knew absolutely nothing about cocaine.
[02:50:00.860 --> 02:50:04.860]  One of my friends went to college and somebody introduced him to it.
[02:50:04.860 --> 02:50:11.860]  He came from college and we felt that he was doing well because he was playing on the college football team.
[02:50:11.860 --> 02:50:15.860]  He was a star and he had all answers.
[02:50:15.860 --> 02:50:18.860]  So when he told me that cocaine was going to be the next biggest thing, I believed it.
[02:50:18.860 --> 02:50:24.860]  And I jumped right into it, forced him ahead. I started off with $125.
[02:50:24.860 --> 02:50:32.860]  Had days that I made as much as a million dollars a day for like two years and days I made as much as three million dollars.
[02:50:32.860 --> 02:50:41.860]  I mean, it's a situation where any kid in any ghetto, it's easy to be drawn into that environment.
[02:50:41.860 --> 02:50:47.860]  You're talking about people who don't have food to eat, you know, don't have normal clothes, you know.
[02:50:47.860 --> 02:50:51.860]  And everybody wants to be somebody of significance.
[02:50:51.860 --> 02:50:54.860]  You know, none of us want to be out there.
[02:50:54.860 --> 02:50:56.860]  Plus Hollywood glamorize them.
[02:50:56.860 --> 02:51:06.860]  Absolutely. I didn't even think about that part. Hollywood, when you talk about some of the movies, Superfly, Tequila Sunrise, Scarface, The Godfather.
[02:51:06.860 --> 02:51:11.860]  You know, you see people who come over to this country and they basically have nothing.
[02:51:11.860 --> 02:51:21.860]  And then with the help of drugs or the way they make it look like it's drugs, they start to control the whole world or the country.
[02:51:21.860 --> 02:51:24.860]  And I mean, who doesn't want a part of that?
[02:51:24.860 --> 02:51:28.860]  Well, changing consciousness is something humans have done from the very beginning.
[02:51:28.860 --> 02:51:30.860]  And coffee is a serious drug.
[02:51:30.860 --> 02:51:35.860]  You know, you take something like chill force or brain force, it's mother nature, and it's overall good for you.
[02:51:35.860 --> 02:51:41.860]  But I mean, make no mistake, it's something that alters consciousness.
[02:51:41.860 --> 02:51:49.860]  But when did you start discovering that the reason you were being left alone and were dealing $15 million a week or whatever at some points of cocaine,
[02:51:49.860 --> 02:51:56.860]  that the CIA was using you as one of their street level, but major capos in distribution?
[02:51:56.860 --> 02:52:00.860]  Well, I didn't know that until after I got arrested, after Danilo Blandon set me up.
[02:52:00.860 --> 02:52:11.860]  So once I got arrested and we started going through the trial, me and Alan Finster, he gets a call one day and he says this reporter says that he's following our informant.
[02:52:11.860 --> 02:52:16.860]  So first of all, we didn't know if he had the right informant, you know, because there's a lot of informants.
[02:52:16.860 --> 02:52:23.860]  And he started to describe this guy to me and he said, well, Gary Webb wants to come down and meet you in person into the prison.
[02:52:23.860 --> 02:52:24.860]  Do you want to meet him?
[02:52:24.860 --> 02:52:25.860]  And I was like, yeah.
[02:52:25.860 --> 02:52:37.860]  So Gary came down and let me tell you, Gary was a very, very cool guy, somebody that you feel comfortable being around, you know, not threatening, not boastful.
[02:52:37.860 --> 02:52:49.860]  Just, you know, a down the earth, jean wearing tennis shoe guy that he would make you feel comfortable, you know, somebody that that you would trust.
[02:52:49.860 --> 02:52:55.860]  And after we talked that first day, he came down maybe about four or five more times.
[02:52:55.860 --> 02:52:57.860]  Gary didn't give me much information.
[02:52:57.860 --> 02:53:04.860]  You know, the deal was when we talk on the phone that he was going to help me with my case and he had information for me.
[02:53:04.860 --> 02:53:12.860]  But really what he did on those first interviews was just decipher what I had, the information that I knew.
[02:53:12.860 --> 02:53:14.860]  Why do you think they burned you?
[02:53:14.860 --> 02:53:23.860]  Well, if I would have been out on the street free, in this case hit the fan, I would have been more credible.
[02:53:23.860 --> 02:53:28.860]  Because what they tried to do is they tried to make this story as if I created this story.
[02:53:28.860 --> 02:53:38.860]  One of the things that Gary did with them is he said that I would have had to been really, really creative to create the paper trail that went along with the story.
[02:53:38.860 --> 02:53:44.860]  And, you know, just for the record, I didn't create the story. I'm not the one that came up with the idea about the CIA.
[02:53:44.860 --> 02:53:46.860]  I knew absolutely nothing.
[02:53:46.860 --> 02:53:56.860]  Well, they've now, as you know, years after even north, I mean, Gary's death, Gary Webb's death, that Iran, Contra, all this, they had hearings confirming it all in the Congress.
[02:53:56.860 --> 02:53:58.860]  Absolutely. I saw the paperwork.
[02:53:58.860 --> 02:54:02.860]  I got a photo from the CIA themselves.
[02:54:02.860 --> 02:54:11.860]  And this is, I guess, this is kind of when I really like, because I really didn't believe it either, you know, I read in the newspaper when the paper came out.
[02:54:11.860 --> 02:54:17.860]  And I was like, no, not me with the CIA, no way, no way possible. I'm a rebel. You know, I was against the government.
[02:54:17.860 --> 02:54:20.860]  You know, I didn't want to be with the government.
[02:54:20.860 --> 02:54:34.860]  So then when the CIA themselves said that, yes, we knew these guys were selling drugs, but we didn't sanction it. We didn't sanction them selling drugs, but we knew they were selling drugs and they were part of our army.
[02:54:34.860 --> 02:54:41.860]  And we went to Attorney General to write a letter and ask her that we not have to report these guys selling drugs.
[02:54:41.860 --> 02:54:51.860]  So when I saw that, it was kind of like, hold up now, if you go with your same conspiracy theory, you know, that I was in prison on, because I never got caught with drugs.
[02:54:51.860 --> 02:55:01.860]  The only thing that I got caught with was guys saying, oh, well, this day, Rick had 10 keys. The other day I saw him, well, a year ago, I saw him sell 20 keys to this guy.
[02:55:01.860 --> 02:55:09.860]  I saw him sell 10 keys. I saw him with $50,000. I saw him with $100,000. And that's the kind of evidence that I was convicted on.
[02:55:09.860 --> 02:55:29.860]  So my theory was, is that if you went with that same type of evidence with this conspiracy for the Iran-Contra, Nicaragua connection, then these guys could have been convicted under those same circumstances.
[02:55:29.860 --> 02:55:32.860]  So that was my theory.
[02:55:32.860 --> 02:55:39.860]  So basically, to try to cover up the larger story, they claim you were the guy with the story and that you were just a drug dealer who concocted it.
[02:55:39.860 --> 02:55:42.860]  Right. That was the LA Times, you know.
[02:55:42.860 --> 02:55:44.860]  Well, it turned out it was big rum of the CIA.
[02:55:44.860 --> 02:55:55.860]  Yeah, Gary, Jesse Katz, you know, who was a friend of mine, had written stories before about me. You know, they hired him to go against Gary Webb.
[02:55:55.860 --> 02:56:10.860]  And you know, you see in the documentary, he's in the documentary apologizing for what he did to Gary. He felt that he probably was one of the ones that drove a knife through Gary's heart by writing the story that he wrote.
[02:56:10.860 --> 02:56:17.860]  Well, they just had the hearings confirming North, I keep saying North thing, but all over North, the whole thing, Gary Webb.
[02:56:17.860 --> 02:56:25.860]  And he had that new book coming out that never got published proving he was right. And then that's when he conveniently dies. It's a real tragedy.
[02:56:25.860 --> 02:56:38.860]  Well, we know that the CIA confirmed Gary's story. I mean, now they didn't say, well, this particular agent or this particular president or this vice president or this general okayed it.
[02:56:38.860 --> 02:56:44.860]  But they said that we as a whole knew that these guys were selling drugs.
[02:56:44.860 --> 02:56:52.860]  And now it works was to buy the weapons from the U.S. clandestinely they let them ship the drugs in and then have you and others sell them.
[02:56:52.860 --> 02:56:58.860]  Right. Well, what they needed, you know, Congress had had had had outlawed them giving money to the countries.
[02:56:58.860 --> 02:57:06.860]  So what they needed is they needed a source where this money was coming from where Congress couldn't tell that the money was was was being given or was being raised.
[02:57:06.860 --> 02:57:10.860]  So what better way to do it than to raise it on the black market.
[02:57:10.860 --> 02:57:18.860]  Absolutely. You go back to Iran, Contra and all of that, of course, it all later came out in Congress, obviously the 80s, one of the 90s and more of its come out today.
[02:57:18.860 --> 02:57:25.860]  And then we see China trying to ship in 25,000 tons and up to kill 10 billion plus people with a lethal dose.
[02:57:25.860 --> 02:57:29.860]  And this is just the way governments fight wars.
[02:57:29.860 --> 02:57:37.860]  And so we need to talk about the fact that the black community was particularly a dumping site for the cocaine to raise the money.
[02:57:37.860 --> 02:57:42.860]  Why would that be done? We'll be right back with power number four with freeway Rick Ross.
[02:58:07.860 --> 02:58:29.860]  Well, you're right. And all of these things are known to be incredible, whether it's turmeric or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil, or whether it's the DNA force with the Coke U 10 and bio PQQ and all the rest of it.
[02:58:29.860 --> 02:58:37.860]  But these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body. You take these bases together, then you have your foundation. Now you can build the big strong temple with these products.
[02:58:37.860 --> 02:58:45.860]  I take my religiously remember to take them. It makes my life so much better. And then it funds the information war, which is so critical. Thank you so much. God bless you.

[03:00:10.860 --> 03:00:17.860]  You know, you're with us for 30 minutes and let's get you back in sooner to talk about all these big issues and big news stories that are out there.
[03:00:17.860 --> 03:00:19.860]  Let's do it. Let's do it.
[03:00:19.860 --> 03:00:26.860]  I don't want to get into the type of stuff that, you know, this is the gossip column stuff, but I do like to talk about stuff where people have had their identity stolen.
[03:00:26.860 --> 03:00:37.860]  Rick Ross is not his name. He's a jail guard. He knew about your story. It's admitted. He stole your identity and you brought this up the third or fourth time I interviewed you one time in studio.
[03:00:37.860 --> 03:00:44.860]  Because I guess you even get it like, you're not the real Rick Ross. It's this guy from his songs and what he says. So it's not that you're putting that guy down.
[03:00:44.860 --> 03:00:47.860]  I think it's important for you to spend a few minutes on the fact that you are Rick Ross.
[03:00:47.860 --> 03:00:49.860]  Absolutely. My mom named me that. Yeah.
[03:00:49.860 --> 03:00:51.860]  Born here in Texas. Kilgore.
[03:00:51.860 --> 03:00:53.860]  That's right.
[03:00:53.860 --> 03:00:58.860]  My birth certificate says Rick Ross. So for everybody who don't know that, I didn't change my name.
[03:00:58.860 --> 03:01:04.860]  I was born Rick Ross and I made Rick Ross famous by going to court.
[03:01:04.860 --> 03:01:11.860]  I wish he would have been going to court and coming to the judge and said, oh, I'm Rick Ross. He's not Rick Ross when I was going to court, but he didn't do that.
[03:01:11.860 --> 03:01:13.860]  He was a jail guard.
[03:01:13.860 --> 03:01:15.860]  Yeah, the fake Rick Ross.
[03:01:15.860 --> 03:01:17.860]  Yeah, yeah, jail guard.
[03:01:17.860 --> 03:01:18.860]  What's his real name?
[03:01:18.860 --> 03:01:31.860]  William Roberts. But that's not the worst part. You know, I got a judgment against me for $700,000 because I tried to sue to stop him from using my name and to stop Universal and Warner Brothers from using my name.
[03:01:31.860 --> 03:01:33.860]  And then they went back with the court fees against you.
[03:01:33.860 --> 03:01:42.860]  Right. They made me pay the attorney fees. I don't know how I lost the case, but well, you know, you know how that goes when you're fighting with big corporations.
[03:01:42.860 --> 03:01:45.860]  But how's old Rick Ross doing today? The fake one?
[03:01:45.860 --> 03:01:51.860]  I don't know. I don't really keep up with him, you know. I mean, he's still making fake music, you know, selling it to the kids.
[03:01:51.860 --> 03:02:00.860]  Sell him what a great drug dealer he was and that you can go out and sell drugs and correlate that into a record career and live happily ever after.
[03:02:00.860 --> 03:02:06.860]  What do you want to tell kids? You travel the country. I'm just going to say that up front, helping kids and keeping away from drugs.
[03:02:06.860 --> 03:02:09.860]  You know, you're really rehearsing some of the things you can say that were bad.
[03:02:09.860 --> 03:02:17.860]  Well, you know, selling drugs, you really got two ends to that. You know, there's no rainbow with a pot of gold at the end of that rainbow.
[03:02:17.860 --> 03:02:27.860]  Use this set of handcuffs or the graveyard. You know, very few people are able to get into the drug business, the black market and come out on top.
[03:02:27.860 --> 03:02:32.860]  You know, it's usually the other way around. You usually come up dead or in jail for really, really long time.
[03:02:32.860 --> 03:02:38.860]  I was about to say, this is a short statement with a long one coming up. Hey, you did probably thousands of big deals. How does you stay alive?
[03:02:38.860 --> 03:02:45.860]  Well, you know, usually when I did deals, I did deals with people that I could trust somewhat.
[03:02:45.860 --> 03:02:56.860]  I mean, you know, you never know who's going to be the one to turn on you or anything like that because it was my next door neighbor who really corroborated the evidence to convict me.
[03:02:56.860 --> 03:03:01.860]  But, you know, you really got to be a good judgment of people. You got to be a good judgment of character.
[03:03:01.860 --> 03:03:09.860]  You got to always put yourself in a position to win, you know, like you don't do deals in places that you don't know about.
[03:03:09.860 --> 03:03:17.860]  You know, you don't allow somebody to take you into the back of a big warehouse that you've never been or in the back of a woods and do a deal.
[03:03:17.860 --> 03:03:26.860]  You know, I would do my deals in shopping center parking lots, you know, where it was really visible and a lot of people would be around.
[03:03:26.860 --> 03:03:39.860]  I mean, a lot of people don't like doing deals like that, but I felt more comfortable with, you know, doing it in public locations where if something went down, a lot of people would see what was going on.
[03:03:39.860 --> 03:03:42.860]  Did you ever have somebody pull something on you?
[03:03:42.860 --> 03:03:55.860]  I've been beat a lot. But usually, you know, the way I did it is you wouldn't have to rob me because I would give it to you in your hand and then it was up to you to bring my money back or not.
[03:03:55.860 --> 03:03:59.860]  You know, consignment is what they call it in the drug business.
[03:03:59.860 --> 03:04:03.860]  Plus, if they were smart, they do it over and over again instead of just stealing it once.
[03:04:03.860 --> 03:04:11.860]  Right. Well, you figure, you know, you might make some money one time, but if you, you know, do it like I did for eight years, then you make a lot of money.
[03:04:11.860 --> 03:04:17.860]  One time you make a little money, but if you can, I mean, it's good business.
[03:04:17.860 --> 03:04:22.860]  You run to people that would rather screw you one time that they like just get off on it.
[03:04:22.860 --> 03:04:23.860]  Right. They just can't help it.
[03:04:23.860 --> 03:04:32.860]  Yeah, yeah. But in any business, it's better to be consistent and to do what you're supposed to do and you have repeated business.
[03:04:32.860 --> 03:04:35.860]  So there's even a layer of morals and drug dealing.
[03:04:35.860 --> 03:04:41.860]  We'll be right back with the real Rick Ross. I'm Alex Jones and I am the real Alex Jones.
[03:04:41.860 --> 03:04:53.860]  Not, not Bill Hicks. We'll be right back. FreewayRickRoss.com
[03:05:12.860 --> 03:05:18.860]  We've launched it, ladies and gentlemen. It's now live. Band.video.
[03:05:18.860 --> 03:05:25.860]  Band.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones or David Knight or Owen Schreuer or Paul Watson band videos.
[03:05:25.860 --> 03:05:40.860]  We are building it to be a place where band memes are able to be posted and where a growing list of freedom loving contributors are able to have a home free for being shut down, free from being censored, free from being silenced by big tech,
[03:05:40.860 --> 03:05:43.860]  the chai comms, the Hollywood scum and the globalist.
[03:05:43.860 --> 03:05:48.860]  Freedom of speech has a home. It's called band.video.
[03:05:48.860 --> 03:05:53.860]  America and the world is fighting back against tyranny at band.video.
[03:05:53.860 --> 03:06:00.860]  Well, he at the time was the biggest kingpin drug dealer, cocaine dealer in America.
[03:06:00.860 --> 03:06:13.860]  Fira Rick Ross, he just missed it. He travels to country teaching kids, don't get into drug dealing, don't get into corruption.
[03:06:13.860 --> 03:06:20.860]  But I just have one of the producers mentioning, and Dave Schrupp calls this special, he says that,
[03:06:20.860 --> 03:06:26.860]  Hey, crack cocaine and targeted black people. So I'm kind of glad to hear on epidemics targeting white people.
[03:06:26.860 --> 03:06:31.860]  Well, is that even true? Plus the average white person didn't know that didn't support it. It's the same big pharma.
[03:06:31.860 --> 03:06:37.860]  Gee, a lot of that's Chinese control. It's not about white people, black people, in my view, even though some of it was done from a racist perspective,
[03:06:37.860 --> 03:06:43.860]  it's about big corporations exploiting people and then they use low level people to carry it out and then get the blame.
[03:06:43.860 --> 03:06:48.860]  Maybe we can find that clip, but what do you think of Chappelle's making that statement?
[03:06:48.860 --> 03:06:55.860]  Well, with drugs, you can't just say that this is for blacks or this is for whites.
[03:06:55.860 --> 03:07:01.860]  Now, in the crack epidemic, blacks were targeted by the police to get arrested.
[03:07:01.860 --> 03:07:02.860]  The longer sentences.
[03:07:02.860 --> 03:07:08.860]  And longer sentences, but whites use cocaine just as much or more than blacks did.
[03:07:08.860 --> 03:07:11.860]  So that's definitely not a true statement.
[03:07:11.860 --> 03:07:17.860]  Now, if he would have said that, well, they're arresting blacks more than they were arresting whites, that would have been a true statement.
[03:07:17.860 --> 03:07:24.860]  But no, it's not. And as for the heroin epidemic, it's not, if it's whites that are doing it now, it's not going to stay that way.
[03:07:24.860 --> 03:07:30.860]  It's going to trickle down to the rest of society because that's just the way drugs work.
[03:07:30.860 --> 03:07:35.860]  It may start with one person, but it's like a virus. It has its way of getting introduced.
[03:07:35.860 --> 03:07:43.860]  Well, I've been down to Skid Row in LA and it's, I'd say about half white, maybe like 40% black and maybe 10% Asian.
[03:07:43.860 --> 03:07:46.860]  I mean, it's a lot of black folks on heroin down there.
[03:07:46.860 --> 03:07:50.860]  Yeah, yeah, it affects everybody. I mean, it's an epidemic.
[03:07:50.860 --> 03:08:02.860]  And when you're dealing with epidemics, I mean, you know, we have to try to get out of the black and white concept because it's a universal epidemic.
[03:08:02.860 --> 03:08:10.860]  What do you think of Trump trying to reverse the Democrat policies of the 90s with the long, when Hillary said blacks were super predators, got to be brought to heel?
[03:08:10.860 --> 03:08:13.860]  I don't know if you've ever seen that quote. And then Trump is trying to reverse that right now.
[03:08:13.860 --> 03:08:18.860]  Yeah, I didn't know that. That's a good thing. We definitely need...
[03:08:18.860 --> 03:08:20.860]  See, the media won't even give him credit.
[03:08:20.860 --> 03:08:21.860]  Yeah.
[03:08:21.860 --> 03:08:24.860]  But that's why Kanye West went there and I got him to do that.
[03:08:24.860 --> 03:08:28.860]  Yeah, well, I know Kim Kardashian has been working with him as well.
[03:08:28.860 --> 03:08:29.860]  Yeah.
[03:08:29.860 --> 03:08:38.860]  Matter of fact, TMZ had hit me up one day about her doing that and she was getting a death rise for inmates, for people who are getting out of prison.
[03:08:38.860 --> 03:08:45.860]  And they asked me how did I feel about it and I thought it was a wonderful thing because when people get out of prison, you've been in prison 20, 30 years.
[03:08:45.860 --> 03:08:49.860]  Most of your family probably dead. You probably don't have any friends and you don't have any resources.
[03:08:49.860 --> 03:08:55.860]  So any resources that we can give inmates to help them stay out of trouble, I think is a great thing.
[03:08:55.860 --> 03:09:04.860]  Let me ask you this. Not really getting in trouble with the Trump statement, but just wondering, what was your view of Trump before he ran for president and then what the media turned him to once he did?
[03:09:04.860 --> 03:09:11.860]  Well, I read a couple of books on Trump when I was in prison and I don't know.
[03:09:11.860 --> 03:09:16.860]  I felt, I use his books. I use some of his techniques now.
[03:09:16.860 --> 03:09:22.860]  But the way he's being portrayed on the news right now is villainary.
[03:09:22.860 --> 03:09:25.860]  Villinary. That's a good word. Well, they do it to me.
[03:09:25.860 --> 03:09:28.860]  I mean, they say I wrote a book about Sandy Hook and harassed families.
[03:09:28.860 --> 03:09:33.860]  I never wrote a book about Sandy Hook. They say I lost a suit. That's AP. That's not true.
[03:09:33.860 --> 03:09:38.860]  None of it's true. They say I lost an appeal yesterday. I didn't.
[03:09:38.860 --> 03:09:43.860]  Yeah, they just lie. I mean, I'm saying levels of lies.
[03:09:43.860 --> 03:09:46.860]  When you're experiencing it yourself, then you know how big it is.
[03:09:46.860 --> 03:09:55.860]  Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. And a lot of times with us as people, we don't believe certain things until they absolutely affect us personally.
[03:09:55.860 --> 03:10:04.860]  You know, we go along with it, but then when it affects our family personally is when we start to notice that it's not right.
[03:10:04.860 --> 03:10:08.860]  You travel all over the country because I see you popping up here there.
[03:10:08.860 --> 03:10:14.860]  I do. Speaking of coming, you've done a lot of good for any bad that you got sucked into.
[03:10:14.860 --> 03:10:18.860]  I mean, how many schools, how many colleges have you talked to and explained that drugs aren't glamorous?
[03:10:18.860 --> 03:10:26.860]  Oh my God, hundreds of schools. And I would do more if they would let me, but we still had that stigma about drug dealers.
[03:10:26.860 --> 03:10:32.860]  You're not reformed even though you did 20, 30 years in prison. You're still not reformed. You're still a drug dealer.
[03:10:32.860 --> 03:10:39.860]  But the kids are really going to listen to the drug. They want it. They want it. They want to know what had happened.
[03:10:39.860 --> 03:10:46.860]  How did you get started? I just did a school in Kansas City last week and I did a survey with the kids.
[03:10:46.860 --> 03:10:51.860]  And I just started asking them, you know, okay, can anybody here tell me who introduced you to drugs first?
[03:10:51.860 --> 03:10:57.860]  Because this was a school where all the kids have been on drugs before. This was a drug school where kids have been suspended from school for using drugs.
[03:10:57.860 --> 03:11:02.860]  And they started raising their hands and they were saying, oh, my uncle turned me on. Oh, my dad.
[03:11:02.860 --> 03:11:03.860]  It's usually family.
[03:11:03.860 --> 03:11:09.860]  It's usually family. It's not some strange guy, you know, that's in the park, you know, wearing a hood and hiding out behind the benches.
[03:11:09.860 --> 03:11:13.860]  Hey, little kid, come here. Let me introduce you. That's not how it happens.
[03:11:13.860 --> 03:11:23.860]  And I had to explain that to the teachers that most of these kids got hooked on drugs from somebody that they trusted, from somebody that they love.
[03:11:23.860 --> 03:11:29.860]  And that's something that families need to know as well, that your kid is not going to get hooked on drugs by some stranger.
[03:11:29.860 --> 03:11:33.860]  It's going to be his uncle, his auntie, his big brother, his sister, just like with me.
[03:11:33.860 --> 03:11:38.860]  The guy who introduced me to drugs was like my big brother. He was that brother that I didn't have.
[03:11:38.860 --> 03:11:45.860]  And I looked up to him. I thought that he was right. I thought he knew what he was doing. And he got me started.
[03:11:45.860 --> 03:11:48.860]  Well, that's the way it is with so many things. But think about Big Pharma.
[03:11:48.860 --> 03:11:54.860]  They sell drugs that are worse than cocaine, as bad as heroin, and they're pushing it in schools.
[03:11:54.860 --> 03:11:58.860]  They're pushing it everywhere. Something like 30 percent of women are antidepressants.
[03:11:58.860 --> 03:12:03.860]  Those drugs say on the insert, they eat holes in your brain. They make your heart swell.
[03:12:03.860 --> 03:12:08.860]  They lower your IQ. They can cause you to become a mass murderer.
[03:12:08.860 --> 03:12:14.860]  It says on the insert that almost every one of these crazy mass shooters is on it.
[03:12:14.860 --> 03:12:21.860]  Well, those drugs, those drugs, dealers should be responsible. They, they, they, they could be held responsible for those shootings.
[03:12:21.860 --> 03:12:30.860]  I mean, technically, if they go with the conspiracy theory, because with the conspiracy theory, if I hand you the gun and you go out and do a shooting, I'm responsible.
[03:12:30.860 --> 03:12:40.860]  So if I'm prescribing drugs, if I'm paying doctors, because that's what they do, you know, they pay doctors to, to subscribe drugs to people.
[03:12:40.860 --> 03:12:47.860]  The more drugs you subscribe people to, the bigger your bonus is going to be. So technically, they're...
[03:12:47.860 --> 03:12:52.860]  Oh, exactly. I mean, have you ever seen how beautiful these female drug reps are at these doctor's offices?
[03:12:52.860 --> 03:12:57.860]  And I'm telling you, let me tell you, those beautiful female drug reps, they're not just getting bonuses.
[03:12:57.860 --> 03:13:02.860]  They're having sex with the doctors. They sell enough.
[03:13:02.860 --> 03:13:05.860]  So you get the rep too, right?
[03:13:05.860 --> 03:13:11.860]  I wouldn't be surprised because I mean, at the end of the day is, is these people are strictly...
[03:13:11.860 --> 03:13:15.860]  They like I was when I was selling drugs, you know, I was strictly dealing for the money.
[03:13:15.860 --> 03:13:20.860]  I didn't care about the human life, what was, how was it going to affect anybody else?
[03:13:20.860 --> 03:13:21.860]  The only thing I really care about...
[03:13:21.860 --> 03:13:24.860]  Look, CBS News, Pfizer drug sells having sex with doctors.
[03:13:24.860 --> 03:13:25.860]  Wow.
[03:13:25.860 --> 03:13:26.860]  Keep going, sorry.
[03:13:26.860 --> 03:13:33.860]  So, so when you're in that state of mind where you don't really value people, you only value the money,
[03:13:33.860 --> 03:13:37.860]  then you don't really care what happens to the people.
[03:13:37.860 --> 03:13:39.860]  Man, that's so crazy.
[03:13:39.860 --> 03:13:42.860]  We have to change that. We have to change our...
[03:13:42.860 --> 03:13:48.860]  And we have to start with our kids to where, you know, now we value life and not just the buck.
[03:13:48.860 --> 03:13:54.860]  I agree. That's what I've said is if you, they're going to shut up about these mass shootings that are terrible,
[03:13:54.860 --> 03:13:58.860]  it's still statistically very, very rare compared to all these other things that kill you.
[03:13:58.860 --> 03:14:05.860]  As soon as people start suing the drug makers of the drugs that most of these people are on that say they actually make you do it,
[03:14:05.860 --> 03:14:08.860]  that's when they're going to change the subject off the average gun owner and blaming.
[03:14:08.860 --> 03:14:11.860]  In fact, I have a statistic here. This is a big meme going viral.
[03:14:11.860 --> 03:14:18.860]  10,874 people killed by drunk drivers in 2017 and 403 by rifles.
[03:14:18.860 --> 03:14:22.860]  Walmart stopped selling rifles, still sells alcohol.
[03:14:22.860 --> 03:14:26.860]  That's real numbers. Real numbers. The numbers are always two years behind.
[03:14:26.860 --> 03:14:29.860]  And so mass shootings might kill 150 people a year.
[03:14:29.860 --> 03:14:35.860]  If you count gang related, it's 300, 350. Still terrible, but 10,000 from drunk drivers.
[03:14:35.860 --> 03:14:39.860]  We're not saying, you know, they shouldn't sell alcohol because some people are doing it responsibly.
[03:14:39.860 --> 03:14:45.860]  It's the person, what they do with the alcohol that's at fault, not the alcohol, just like it's not the gun's fault.
[03:14:45.860 --> 03:14:48.860]  Good point. Good point.
[03:14:48.860 --> 03:14:57.860]  I think we need to go on the offense against these drug makers because enough fentanyl to kill 10,601,000,000 people got caught being shipped to the U.S.
[03:14:57.860 --> 03:15:03.860]  Well, we already know that alcohol and cigarettes kill more people than all illegal drugs put together.
[03:15:03.860 --> 03:15:09.860]  You can combine all the illegal drugs together and they still don't kill as many people as alcohol and cigarettes.
[03:15:09.860 --> 03:15:13.860]  So we definitely have some issues, but you know, we got to change our politicians.
[03:15:13.860 --> 03:15:22.860]  Our politicians are on the take as well. You know, they're getting paid by these big companies and they're going to make decisions to benefit the country.
[03:15:22.860 --> 03:15:29.860]  We got to start caring about each other again. And like you said, the cigarette makers get caught putting hundreds of chemicals in that are drugs that are more addictive than cocaine.
[03:15:29.860 --> 03:15:32.860]  Talk tobacco. You're addicted to the chemicals they're adding to it.
[03:15:32.860 --> 03:15:35.860]  And are they in trouble? We need to look at all of this.
[03:15:35.860 --> 03:15:43.860]  Final segment with the real freeway Rick Ross, straight ahead, we'll get into his book, Ridin' with Rick, the 21 keys of success.

[03:17:21.860 --> 03:17:28.860]  Hi, I'm Dan Pilla. I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house. I sued the IRS in one.
[03:17:28.860 --> 03:17:37.860]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since. I wrote the book on tax debt settlement and I've helped thousands of people deal with tax problems they thought might never be solved.
[03:17:37.860 --> 03:17:43.860]  I can help you too. If you owe taxes you can't pay, don't wait another day. There's no such thing as a hopeless tax case.

[03:17:53.860 --> 03:17:59.860]  Josh in Washington, you're on the air, go ahead. Alex, God bless you. I have an idea for a new info wars t-shirt.
[03:17:59.860 --> 03:18:05.860]  Instead of this is your brain, this is your brain on drugs, this is your brain, this is your brain on 5G.
[03:18:05.860 --> 03:18:10.860]  Showing your brain, getting fried. Then I have some comments on your supplements, man. Totally changed my life.
[03:18:10.860 --> 03:18:16.860]  I use turbo force, bodies, album power, brain force, fish oil, ultra 12 daily, X2 every several days.
[03:18:16.860 --> 03:18:24.860]  Now, what I've found is really combining them is sort of synergistic and transcendent feeling that I get by combining all your products
[03:18:24.860 --> 03:18:28.860]  and I just want to urge all your listeners who haven't tried them, I just want to say why not.
[03:18:28.860 --> 03:18:34.860]  Well, you're right that all of these things are known to be incredible, whether it's turmeric or whether it's the fish oil or the krill oil
[03:18:34.860 --> 03:18:38.860]  or whether it's the DNA force with the CoQ10 and BioPQQ and all the rest of it.
[03:18:38.860 --> 03:18:43.860]  All of these are things that are like rocket fuel on the body. You take these bases together, then you have your foundation,
[03:18:43.860 --> 03:18:48.860]  now you can build the big, strong temple. With these products I take, when I religiously remember to take them,
[03:18:48.860 --> 03:18:52.860]  it makes my life so much better and then it funds the information war, which is so critical.
[03:18:52.860 --> 03:18:53.860]  Thank you so much. God bless you.
[03:18:53.860 --> 03:18:58.860]  And that's why we're introducing what we know is going to be a massive best seller, chill force.
[03:18:58.860 --> 03:19:01.860]  Now, let's look at what's in this powerful formula.
[03:19:01.860 --> 03:19:08.860]  Ashwagandha root extract, an ancient medicinal herb used for over 3,000 years to treat stress and relax the patient.
[03:19:08.860 --> 03:19:13.860]  L-theanine, a special amino acid naturally found in some tea leaves.
[03:19:13.860 --> 03:19:18.860]  The compound has been called the stress killer because of its powerful relaxation benefits.
[03:19:18.860 --> 03:19:24.860]  Gabba, an important neurotransmitter that controls functions of the body and mind, including nervous system relaxation.
[03:19:24.860 --> 03:19:27.860]  Gabba is a choice for many to help reduce anxiety.
[03:19:27.860 --> 03:19:32.860]  Rodeola rosea root extract, found in the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia.
[03:19:32.860 --> 03:19:40.860]  This root is considered a super adaptogen and is believed to help the body in the fight against emotional, mental and physical stress.
[03:19:40.860 --> 03:20:04.860]  It's time to do what I did and take action with the chill force challenge at infowarslive.com.
[03:20:11.860 --> 03:20:18.860]  The wheels of his Mustang exploding on the highway like a slug from a 45.
[03:20:18.860 --> 03:20:22.860]  True death.
[03:20:22.860 --> 03:20:26.860]  Crank it up.
[03:20:26.860 --> 03:20:31.860]  The wheels of his Mustang exploding on the highway like a slug from a 45.
[03:20:31.860 --> 03:20:33.860]  True death.
[03:20:33.860 --> 03:20:35.860]  400 horsepower.
[03:20:35.860 --> 03:20:38.860]  400 maybe, I got 700 plus horsepower.
[03:20:38.860 --> 03:20:41.860]  This is black sunshine.
[03:20:41.860 --> 03:20:43.860]  Alright, I'm going to stop that.
[03:20:43.860 --> 03:20:46.860]  The real Rick Ross is here, riding with Rick.
[03:20:46.860 --> 03:20:48.860]  The 21 Keys of Success.
[03:20:48.860 --> 03:20:50.860]  Sounds like a Trumpian book.
[03:20:50.860 --> 03:20:52.860]  I'm going to read this book.
[03:20:52.860 --> 03:20:54.860]  Tell me about it. Tell me about the book.
[03:20:54.860 --> 03:20:58.860]  Well, the book was wrote about my first six months out of prison.
[03:20:58.860 --> 03:21:00.860]  You know, getting out of prison.
[03:21:00.860 --> 03:21:02.860]  I didn't know nobody. I didn't have any money.
[03:21:02.860 --> 03:21:05.860]  You know, I was home for a couple months.
[03:21:05.860 --> 03:21:09.860]  My mom had lost her house. She took one of those,
[03:21:09.860 --> 03:21:11.860]  one of those subprime loans out.
[03:21:11.860 --> 03:21:14.860]  You know, she had a free, her house was free and clear when I went to prison and
[03:21:14.860 --> 03:21:23.860]  she went and borrowed a couple hundred grand and I think the broker took like 80,000 out of the loan right off the top.
[03:21:23.860 --> 03:21:26.860]  And she wind up losing her house right when I got home from prison.
[03:21:26.860 --> 03:21:31.860]  I think I was home for about six months and she had owed,
[03:21:31.860 --> 03:21:36.860]  I think like $48,000 and it was like we need to hold 48,000 right now.
[03:21:36.860 --> 03:21:43.860]  And that's the real crux to have an old lady and you take 40% of the loan as a brokerage fee and rip them off.
[03:21:43.860 --> 03:21:44.860]  Yeah.
[03:21:44.860 --> 03:21:48.860]  I mean, I would see like 10% as a rip off that poor old lady. How the hell do guys do that?
[03:21:48.860 --> 03:21:54.860]  And what really got her is that they started the loan off at $1,200 a month.
[03:21:54.860 --> 03:21:56.860]  So she could afford that.
[03:21:56.860 --> 03:21:57.860]  But it escalated.
[03:21:57.860 --> 03:21:58.860]  Ballooned.
[03:21:58.860 --> 03:22:02.860]  It ballooned to $3,200 a month, which was totally out of her range.
[03:22:02.860 --> 03:22:09.860]  When I got home, Alex, she didn't have food to eat because she was trying to pay the market.
[03:22:09.860 --> 03:22:14.860]  Did you know it was Larry Summers and Bill Clinton changed the laws for all that loan sharking?
[03:22:14.860 --> 03:22:15.860]  No, I didn't know.
[03:22:15.860 --> 03:22:21.860]  And out of places like Arkansas that had some of the strongest laws against payday loans and usury, they've gotten rid of all those laws.
[03:22:21.860 --> 03:22:25.860]  Well, that's a good thing because so many people lost their homes.
[03:22:25.860 --> 03:22:29.860]  No, no, no, and I'm saying they got rid of the laws protecting people.
[03:22:29.860 --> 03:22:30.860]  Oh, they got rid of laws protecting people.
[03:22:30.860 --> 03:22:31.860]  Yeah.
[03:22:31.860 --> 03:22:32.860]  Yeah.
[03:22:32.860 --> 03:22:33.860]  I'm not trying to bash Bill Clinton.
[03:22:33.860 --> 03:22:35.860]  It's just that super evil stuff came out.
[03:22:35.860 --> 03:22:37.860]  Well, what it is, you just call it what it is.
[03:22:37.860 --> 03:22:38.860]  You know, you call it what it is.
[03:22:38.860 --> 03:22:39.860]  If it's a spade, it's a spade.
[03:22:39.860 --> 03:22:40.860]  Who did it?
[03:22:40.860 --> 03:22:41.860]  Who cares?
[03:22:41.860 --> 03:22:42.860]  Who did it?
[03:22:42.860 --> 03:22:43.860]  You say who did it?
[03:22:43.860 --> 03:22:46.860]  Man, I would be so afraid of God because I know God's real.
[03:22:46.860 --> 03:22:51.860]  If I was ripping off old ladies, I mean, these people are crazy doing that.
[03:22:51.860 --> 03:22:55.860]  Man, do they have any idea how bad luck they're getting?
[03:22:55.860 --> 03:22:56.860]  I mean, you're going to pay in this life.
[03:22:56.860 --> 03:22:57.860]  You're going to pay after.
[03:22:57.860 --> 03:23:01.860]  Well, some of the people that they already rich, they got more money than sin.
[03:23:01.860 --> 03:23:03.860]  I mean, they can't spend all the money they got already.
[03:23:03.860 --> 03:23:07.860]  Why do they continue to take?
[03:23:07.860 --> 03:23:12.860]  Why don't you give all the old ladies the best deal and then you get them all in a little percentage?
[03:23:12.860 --> 03:23:14.860]  Why would you want to screw them over?
[03:23:14.860 --> 03:23:15.860]  Right.
[03:23:15.860 --> 03:23:16.860]  I don't understand that.
[03:23:16.860 --> 03:23:17.860]  Yeah.
[03:23:17.860 --> 03:23:19.860]  But it goes back to the business thing.
[03:23:19.860 --> 03:23:20.860]  Yeah, it's crazy.
[03:23:20.860 --> 03:23:23.860]  But that's how this book came about.
[03:23:23.860 --> 03:23:29.860]  And my friend, Cody, who I had sent him these three books that I had read, my favorite three
[03:23:29.860 --> 03:23:35.860]  books, Think and Grow Rich, The Richest Man in Babylon, and As a Man Think to Read.
[03:23:35.860 --> 03:23:36.860]  And he read the books.
[03:23:36.860 --> 03:23:41.860]  So when he got out, I mean, when I got out, we were riding around and he saw me using these
[03:23:41.860 --> 03:23:42.860]  principles.
[03:23:42.860 --> 03:23:46.860]  And he was like, man, these must be the principles that you use to be so successful.
[03:23:46.860 --> 03:23:48.860]  And he was documenting everything.
[03:23:48.860 --> 03:23:50.860]  And the book just came about like that there.
[03:23:50.860 --> 03:23:55.860]  So it's 21 keys, my 21 most important keys.
[03:23:55.860 --> 03:24:00.860]  We start off with the number one where we thought were the most important, which was being humble.
[03:24:00.860 --> 03:24:06.860]  It's very important for us to be humble as people because when you're humble, people like you.
[03:24:06.860 --> 03:24:07.860]  They don't mind working with you.
[03:24:07.860 --> 03:24:14.860]  But when you're boastful, when you are overbearing, people have a resentment for you.
[03:24:14.860 --> 03:24:18.860]  They don't really want to be around you.
[03:24:18.860 --> 03:24:21.860]  So we felt that being humble was the most important.
[03:24:21.860 --> 03:24:23.860]  And if you're mentally humble, it doesn't cloud your judgment.
[03:24:23.860 --> 03:24:24.860]  Yeah.
[03:24:24.860 --> 03:24:27.860]  These guys that get on a power trip, I noticed they're not thinking too smart.
[03:24:27.860 --> 03:24:28.860]  Right.
[03:24:28.860 --> 03:24:29.860]  Right.
[03:24:29.860 --> 03:24:32.860]  And you have to have an open mind.
[03:24:32.860 --> 03:24:36.860]  Because if you don't have an open mind, you can't visualize the future.
[03:24:36.860 --> 03:24:39.860]  You can't see what's coming.
[03:24:39.860 --> 03:24:42.860]  And you wind up being stagnated.
[03:24:42.860 --> 03:24:46.860]  So that's how the book came about.
[03:24:46.860 --> 03:24:47.860]  Give me some more principles.
[03:24:47.860 --> 03:24:51.860]  I can't wait to read it.
[03:24:51.860 --> 03:24:52.860]  You have to study.
[03:24:52.860 --> 03:24:57.860]  You have to be somebody who, once you find out whatever the field is that you're going into,
[03:24:57.860 --> 03:25:00.860]  you have to learn as much about it as you can.
[03:25:00.860 --> 03:25:04.860]  One of the things that I found out about myself, and I didn't really understand that,
[03:25:04.860 --> 03:25:08.860]  but when I first started selling cocaine, I knew absolutely nothing about cocaine.
[03:25:08.860 --> 03:25:09.860]  I didn't know what it looked like.
[03:25:09.860 --> 03:25:10.860]  I didn't know what it smelled like.
[03:25:10.860 --> 03:25:13.860]  I didn't know the color.
[03:25:13.860 --> 03:25:14.860]  I was a novice.
[03:25:14.860 --> 03:25:15.860]  That's a good rule.
[03:25:15.860 --> 03:25:17.860]  You didn't get high on your own supply.
[03:25:17.860 --> 03:25:18.860]  No, I didn't.
[03:25:18.860 --> 03:25:19.860]  I didn't.
[03:25:19.860 --> 03:25:20.860]  They taught me that, though.
[03:25:20.860 --> 03:25:21.860]  I was taught by the people.
[03:25:21.860 --> 03:25:22.860]  Don't take it.
[03:25:22.860 --> 03:25:23.860]  Don't take it.
[03:25:23.860 --> 03:25:26.860]  If you don't take it, you're going to be rich.
[03:25:26.860 --> 03:25:28.860]  So I didn't take it.
[03:25:28.860 --> 03:25:33.860]  And that's one of the other things that I learned about drugs, too, as well.
[03:25:33.860 --> 03:25:37.860]  Most people who get involved with drugs don't get involved with drugs to become addicts.
[03:25:37.860 --> 03:25:42.860]  Most of the people who get involved with drugs get in it for the money.
[03:25:42.860 --> 03:25:48.860]  But they believe that their willpower is stronger than the drug.
[03:25:48.860 --> 03:25:49.860]  You understand?
[03:25:49.860 --> 03:25:50.860]  Oh, I understand.
[03:25:50.860 --> 03:25:51.860]  That they can take it.
[03:25:51.860 --> 03:25:53.860]  They play with fire.
[03:25:53.860 --> 03:25:54.860]  Exactly.
[03:25:54.860 --> 03:25:56.860]  And that's how most people beat.
[03:25:56.860 --> 03:25:57.860]  Well, that's like me now.
[03:25:57.860 --> 03:25:58.860]  I just don't drink, period.
[03:25:58.860 --> 03:26:01.860]  I'm in a big deal about it on there, but I just don't drink.
[03:26:01.860 --> 03:26:02.860]  Sometimes I joke around.
[03:26:02.860 --> 03:26:03.860]  Sometimes I mean it's stupid.
[03:26:03.860 --> 03:26:04.860]  I'm like, oh, I'm drunk.
[03:26:04.860 --> 03:26:07.860]  But no, I mean, because I'll quit drinking and I'll start drinking.
[03:26:07.860 --> 03:26:08.860]  Not a lot.
[03:26:08.860 --> 03:26:09.860]  Also, I'm drinking a lot.
[03:26:09.860 --> 03:26:10.860]  I just don't drink now.
[03:26:10.860 --> 03:26:11.860]  You got to.
[03:26:11.860 --> 03:26:12.860]  It's much easier.
[03:26:12.860 --> 03:26:13.860]  Just never again.
[03:26:13.860 --> 03:26:14.860]  It's over.
[03:26:14.860 --> 03:26:15.860]  And people ask me that, too, about drugs.
[03:26:15.860 --> 03:26:20.860]  They're like, OK, well, well, if I can control the drug, I said, no, you can't control the drug.
[03:26:20.860 --> 03:26:22.860]  You have to quit totally.
[03:26:22.860 --> 03:26:23.860]  And you never go back.
[03:26:23.860 --> 03:26:25.860]  And if you go back, you didn't really quit.
[03:26:25.860 --> 03:26:26.860]  You only slowed down.
[03:26:26.860 --> 03:26:28.860]  So it's a different and slowing down and quitting.
[03:26:28.860 --> 03:26:30.860]  And then it dominates your life with anything.
[03:26:30.860 --> 03:26:31.860]  Is alcohols a drug?
[03:26:31.860 --> 03:26:32.860]  A deadly drug?
[03:26:32.860 --> 03:26:34.860]  Your whole life's about you want it.
[03:26:34.860 --> 03:26:35.860]  You need it.
[03:26:35.860 --> 03:26:36.860]  You're not going to have it.
[03:26:36.860 --> 03:26:37.860]  You're going to have it.
[03:26:37.860 --> 03:26:40.860]  And it's just like, no, you're not in my life.
[03:26:40.860 --> 03:26:41.860]  Right.
[03:26:41.860 --> 03:26:42.860]  Right.
[03:26:42.860 --> 03:26:43.860]  With anything.
[03:26:43.860 --> 03:26:44.860]  I mean, it could be a woman, a man.
[03:26:44.860 --> 03:26:45.860]  If somebody is not.
[03:26:45.860 --> 03:26:47.860]  Alcohol is like an evil woman.
[03:26:47.860 --> 03:26:49.860]  Or for a woman, I'd be like an evil man.
[03:26:49.860 --> 03:26:52.860]  It's just great when it isn't in your life anymore.
[03:26:52.860 --> 03:26:53.860]  Yeah.
[03:26:53.860 --> 03:26:54.860]  Yeah.
[03:26:54.860 --> 03:26:55.860]  I mean, you have to just like, like leave it.
[03:26:55.860 --> 03:27:00.860]  I mean, that's the way I had to do with cocaine because I loved selling cocaine.
[03:27:00.860 --> 03:27:01.860]  I fell in love with it.
[03:27:01.860 --> 03:27:02.860]  It didn't.
[03:27:02.860 --> 03:27:07.860]  Mine had got to the point where it wasn't about the money anymore.
[03:27:07.860 --> 03:27:09.860]  The money wasn't my high anymore.
[03:27:09.860 --> 03:27:12.860]  My high was selling a lot of drugs.
[03:27:12.860 --> 03:27:13.860]  Being number one.
[03:27:13.860 --> 03:27:14.860]  Being number one.
[03:27:14.860 --> 03:27:15.860]  How much drugs can I sell?
[03:27:15.860 --> 03:27:17.860]  How many kilos can I get rid of today?
[03:27:17.860 --> 03:27:19.860]  How many kilos am I going to be to get rid of tomorrow?
[03:27:19.860 --> 03:27:22.860]  And it wasn't about how much money was I making because I didn't care.
[03:27:22.860 --> 03:27:30.860]  You know, I had everything that I wanted, but I still had that intensity, that passion.
[03:27:30.860 --> 03:27:31.860]  Drive.
[03:27:31.860 --> 03:27:32.860]  To do more.
[03:27:32.860 --> 03:27:33.860]  I want to do more.
[03:27:33.860 --> 03:27:35.860]  I want to do more tomorrow than I did yesterday.
[03:27:35.860 --> 03:27:37.860]  I want to do more next week.
[03:27:37.860 --> 03:27:40.860]  And you know, I want to be bigger next week than I am today.
[03:27:40.860 --> 03:27:42.860]  And the CIA had all you needed.
[03:27:42.860 --> 03:27:44.860]  More and cheaper.
[03:27:44.860 --> 03:27:48.860]  So, so, so they were like trying to sell you so much you couldn't even move it.
[03:27:48.860 --> 03:27:50.860]  They're like, slow down.
[03:27:50.860 --> 03:27:52.860]  You ever tell them slow down?
[03:27:52.860 --> 03:27:54.860]  Yeah, slow down.
[03:27:54.860 --> 03:27:57.860]  And, and, and that's the way we have to, we have to approach our life like that.
[03:27:57.860 --> 03:28:02.860]  You know, we have to figure out what are the things in our life that are not doing us any good.
[03:28:02.860 --> 03:28:04.860]  And we have to get rid of.
[03:28:04.860 --> 03:28:07.860]  Rick, we should get you on via Skype at least once a month on my show and others.
[03:28:07.860 --> 03:28:11.860]  And anytime you want to come to the studio, I'm so glad that you checked in with us.

[03:28:19.860 --> 03:28:23.860]  Believe me, they'll listen to him a lot more than listen to, you know, the police or their mom.
[03:28:23.860 --> 03:28:27.860]  And the website is freewayrickross.com.
[03:28:27.860 --> 03:28:29.860]  Thanks for coming in, my friend.

[03:28:30.860 --> 03:28:33.860]  I ain't never going to forget, you know, I'm not one to forget my friends.
[03:28:33.860 --> 03:28:37.860]  And what you did for me when you came down to the prison to check on me,
[03:28:37.860 --> 03:28:41.860]  I will never, ever in my life forget that.
[03:28:41.860 --> 03:28:45.860]  Hey, man, you were a big story and I wanted to expose CIA drug dealings to your bad ass.
[03:28:45.860 --> 03:28:46.860]  Well, I appreciate it.
[03:28:46.860 --> 03:28:47.860]  A lot of courage.
[03:28:47.860 --> 03:28:50.860]  I appreciate that, you know, that what you did for me.
[03:28:50.860 --> 03:28:51.860]  I appreciate you, Rick.

[03:33:18.660 --> 03:33:30.660]  We're going to get right to Matt Bracken best selling author, researcher, former Navy
[03:33:30.660 --> 03:33:34.540]  Seal and a really smart fellow about what's happening in the world. Always love to get
[03:33:34.540 --> 03:33:39.220]  his take on things in the war rooms in 30 minutes with Ellen Schreuer. Just remember
[03:33:39.220 --> 03:33:45.860]  we have a new product. It's Chillforce. It's 40% off introductory offer. You get it 50%
[03:33:45.860 --> 03:33:53.020]  off when you get it with a bottle of Brainforce Plus, which is an award-winning super popular
[03:33:53.020 --> 03:34:01.620]  Neutropic. This isn't a downer. This is a relax and focus, probably call it Zen Plus,
[03:34:01.620 --> 03:34:07.540]  but we've named it Chillforce and it goes with Brainforce and Turboforce or it goes
[03:34:07.540 --> 03:34:14.900]  by itself. It doesn't make you sleepy. It makes you not be jittery and it works amazingly.
[03:34:14.900 --> 03:34:19.420]  No reviews yet because it just came out. I've been taking it since I first tried the formula.
[03:34:19.420 --> 03:34:23.820]  We tried three or four different ones from top developers six months ago. For the same
[03:34:23.820 --> 03:34:29.500]  makers that brought you Brainforce, which is again just a souped up already best seller
[03:34:29.500 --> 03:34:34.260]  nationwide, private label by us at a lower price. That's always our wish bug. It's the
[03:34:34.260 --> 03:34:40.100]  award-winning, but Chillforce is proprietary, but it's powerful and it helps find the info
[03:34:40.100 --> 03:34:43.860]  wars and get your Chillforce today and experience it if you like Brainforce. You'll love
[03:34:43.860 --> 03:34:49.620]  Chillforce. You'll also call 888-253-3139. Matt, thank you for letting me preempt Rick
[03:34:49.620 --> 03:34:53.260]  Ross. I'm not mad at him, but he was supposed to be here an hour before, so we had to push
[03:34:53.260 --> 03:34:58.260]  back. I apologize if that happens sometimes. Just briefly, what do you make of the pitch
[03:34:58.260 --> 03:35:04.140]  for the new health DARPA? Harpa. Turns out Obama administration of people run it. It's
[03:35:04.140 --> 03:35:07.940]  being pitched to Trump. I don't think Trump's going to support it. The Washington Post says
[03:35:07.940 --> 03:35:12.260]  he does because of Ivanka and I'm not trying to target Ivanka. I just think she doesn't
[03:35:12.260 --> 03:35:18.980]  know which end of a gun the bullet comes out of. You've got Wal-Mart's CEO adding insult
[03:35:18.980 --> 03:35:24.060]  to injury, not just not selling rifle ammo and handgun ammo, but now saying we should
[03:35:24.060 --> 03:35:28.740]  turn our semi-autos in. You've got the former head of DHS and J. Johnson saying this time
[03:35:28.740 --> 03:35:33.620]  they're going to get our guns. My God, this is out of control. So your take on that, you
[03:35:33.620 --> 03:35:37.900]  go ahead and take over my friend enemiesfarndomestic.com.
[03:35:37.900 --> 03:35:44.820]  Thanks, Alex. Wal-Mart really sticks in my throat. Like in the last segment before, they
[03:35:44.820 --> 03:35:48.740]  were talking about Wal-Mart. You guys were talking about Wal-Mart and they still sell
[03:35:48.740 --> 03:35:58.260]  booze. You can waste yourself on vodka much more certainly than a brick of 22 long rifle
[03:35:58.260 --> 03:36:04.940]  in your closet, which won't hurt anybody. The thing that really sticks with me with
[03:36:04.940 --> 03:36:11.260]  China and Wal-Mart, or China-Mart, is that Wal-Mart, which I think Tucker had a great
[03:36:11.260 --> 03:36:17.780]  episode on this, Wal-Mart laid waste to mom and pop shops across America and replaced
[03:36:17.780 --> 03:36:25.780]  them with cheap stuff made in communist China. Slave labor is not free trade. There's something
[03:36:25.780 --> 03:36:32.340]  to a saying I heard or came up with somewhere, you can't have free trade with slave labor.
[03:36:32.340 --> 03:36:39.700]  So Wal-Mart should be ashamed. I looked up, they actually have Wal-Marts in China now.
[03:36:39.700 --> 03:36:45.460]  Do they sell organs harvested from political prisoners? It's absolutely disgusting that
[03:36:45.460 --> 03:36:51.780]  Wal-Mart can go on virtue signaling about gun violence while their billions and billions
[03:36:51.780 --> 03:37:01.620]  of dollars are harvested, are made from cheap goods made by virtual slave labor. They have
[03:37:01.620 --> 03:37:06.900]  suicide nets around their factories. Their factories have workers that are basically
[03:37:06.900 --> 03:37:13.860]  prisoners where the dormitory, the dining hall and the work floors are all in one building
[03:37:13.860 --> 03:37:20.700]  and you don't get out. That's your choice. Your choice is starve or work in a prison factory
[03:37:20.700 --> 03:37:25.740]  and that's how Wal-Mart has made its money and for them to take the high road over guns
[03:37:25.740 --> 03:37:35.900]  is just really disgusting to me. Anyway, what I want to talk about today, and I know you're
[03:37:35.900 --> 03:37:40.700]  probably really sick of hearing about Hurricane Dorian, it seems like it's been in the news
[03:37:40.700 --> 03:37:45.860]  forever and it's still in the news because it's scraping along the Carolinas now, but
[03:37:45.860 --> 03:37:51.180]  there's an ongoing tragedy in the northern Bahamas which I know a lot about, I've sailed
[03:37:51.180 --> 03:37:58.580]  there a bunch. In the northern Bahamas, this hurricane was a record setter. It was going
[03:37:58.580 --> 03:38:06.020]  at 200 miles an hour for like two days. The eye just going around and around and around.
[03:38:06.020 --> 03:38:11.620]  The people that live there have described it as like a tsunami, a hurricane and tornadoes
[03:38:11.620 --> 03:38:17.740]  that just didn't quit one on one. Now, the video footage you're seeing now is the third
[03:38:17.740 --> 03:38:25.420]  largest city in the Bahamas, Marsh Harbor on Great Abaco and this is the downtown district.
[03:38:25.420 --> 03:38:32.460]  So all of the people, the 20,000 people that live on smaller islands around Marsh Harbor
[03:38:32.460 --> 03:38:38.820]  and in settlements on Great Abaco, this is where they would come to get their blue tarps.
[03:38:38.820 --> 03:38:42.560]  This is where they would come to get their bottled water. The headquarters, the hub
[03:38:42.560 --> 03:38:49.620]  of the abacos is absolutely wrecked. Everything you're seeing here was under a 20-foot storm
[03:38:49.620 --> 03:38:57.060]  surge. So it's all utterly annihilated. The hardware stores, the supermarkets, they're
[03:38:57.060 --> 03:39:03.020]  gutted. Even when you see homes that are still standing, their interiors are gutted. So the
[03:39:03.020 --> 03:39:08.860]  homes that are standing are made out of cinderblock or reinforced concrete, so some of the walls
[03:39:08.860 --> 03:39:15.100]  might be up, but the interiors are gone. There is a 20-foot sort of like a tsunami rolling
[03:39:15.100 --> 03:39:21.760]  back and forth as this eye went around and around over the top of the abacos and then
[03:39:21.760 --> 03:39:28.100]  continued across Grand Bahama, which is a big island with 50,000 people, 90 miles from
[03:39:28.100 --> 03:39:35.060]  east to west, and it just hovered over the eastern part of Grand Bahama for like a full
[03:39:35.060 --> 03:39:41.380]  day. The eye just making rotation after rotation. I've never seen destruction like this, and
[03:39:41.380 --> 03:39:46.380]  not only is this like an appeal to see where you can go to donate to people that are sending
[03:39:46.380 --> 03:39:53.300]  over rescue emergency aid, but this is also a lesson in human dynamics. Now the sun is
[03:39:53.300 --> 03:40:00.500]  back out. It's 85 or 90 degrees there. The sun is shining. The weather is beautiful, but
[03:40:00.500 --> 03:40:06.500]  the people have no water, no food, and only the clothes on their backs. Their houses literally
[03:40:06.500 --> 03:40:13.260]  are empty. The contents of their houses could be a mile away, so everything is a grab bag.
[03:40:13.260 --> 03:40:21.660]  Now Marsh Harbor is a biracial place, maybe 50-50 black-white, and they're all Bahamians,
[03:40:21.660 --> 03:40:27.020]  and they get along well, but there's a huge amount of social pressure where the wealthier
[03:40:27.020 --> 03:40:32.580]  people may live in slightly better houses, further up the hill, perceived to having more
[03:40:32.580 --> 03:40:41.620]  supplies on hand, and the people living at lower levels may have even less. There's reports
[03:40:41.620 --> 03:40:50.380]  of gunfire, looting, social tension breaking out, because it's like an experiment, like
[03:40:50.380 --> 03:40:56.580]  a nuclear blast went off minus the radiation, and absolutely nothing is working. I would
[03:40:56.580 --> 03:41:05.060]  say 95% of the cars in the Abacos and on Grand Bahama are not working, because they were
[03:41:05.060 --> 03:41:13.220]  underwater, I mean way underwater. So you see very few vehicles even moving, and there's
[03:41:13.220 --> 03:41:19.340]  no electricity, and there won't be for weeks. If you had a generator, it probably got ruined
[03:41:19.340 --> 03:41:27.980]  in this title surge tsunami series of tsunamis. So this is like a social experiment, what
[03:41:27.980 --> 03:41:35.300]  happens when people absolutely lose it all, and in the midst of this, it's even taken
[03:41:35.300 --> 03:41:39.500]  three or four days just to get video like this out of the place, and this is the hub
[03:41:39.500 --> 03:41:46.140]  of the Abacos, Marsh Harbor. There are settlements and other islands, like Manoworki, Treasure
[03:41:46.140 --> 03:41:52.380]  Key, Hope Town, Elbow Key, Guana Key, where there are hundreds and a few thousand people
[03:41:52.380 --> 03:41:59.220]  living scattered all over the place, and it's probably even worse in the rest of the islands
[03:41:59.220 --> 03:42:04.620]  around Marsh Harbor. Nobody's even seen them yet. So people are literally, as we speak,
[03:42:04.620 --> 03:42:09.620]  I guarantee you, they are starting to die of dehydration, especially children and older
[03:42:09.620 --> 03:42:15.860]  people, because everything that they've got, their survival supplies, it's all ruined.
[03:42:15.860 --> 03:42:23.220]  They're lost. This was a major marina with like 50, 60-foot sport fishing boats in normal
[03:42:23.220 --> 03:42:30.700]  times. These buildings, these were like great restaurants, great marinas, they're just absolute,
[03:42:30.700 --> 03:42:35.540]  look at that concrete block. These aren't cheap buildings, these aren't huts, and it's
[03:42:35.540 --> 03:42:40.660]  leveled. The few buildings that are still standing like that big paint building, you
[03:42:40.660 --> 03:42:44.940]  can see it's a very well-built building. I'm sure they intended to be hurricane proof,
[03:42:44.940 --> 03:42:50.420]  but it's gutted. When we go come back, I'll move on to some other topics, but it rips
[03:42:50.420 --> 03:42:53.460]  me up seeing what's happening there.
[03:42:53.460 --> 03:43:01.820]  Band.video is the answer to censorship. Band.video is the answer for libertarians, conservatives,
[03:43:01.820 --> 03:43:08.660]  nationalists, pro-gun, pro-life, pro-human individuals to have their own platform where
[03:43:08.660 --> 03:43:13.940]  videos banned by YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter are still available. We've launched it, ladies
[03:43:13.940 --> 03:43:21.940]  and gentlemen. It's now live. Band.video. Band.video isn't just going to be a home for Alex Jones
[03:43:21.940 --> 03:43:26.700]  or David Knight or Owen Troyer or Paul Watson band videos. We are building it to be a place
[03:43:26.700 --> 03:43:32.820]  where banned memes are able to be posted and where a growing list of freedom-loving contributors
[03:43:32.820 --> 03:43:38.180]  are able to have a home free from being shut down, free from being censored, free from
[03:43:38.180 --> 03:43:43.500]  being silenced by big tech, the chai comms, the Hollywood scum, and the globalists. Freedom
[03:43:43.500 --> 03:43:50.340]  of speech has a home. It's called band.video. America and the world is fighting back against
[03:43:50.340 --> 03:43:53.340]  tyranny at band.video.

[03:45:02.060 --> 03:45:08.140]  Ashwagandha root extract, an ancient medicinal herb used for over 3,000 years to treat stress
[03:45:08.140 --> 03:45:13.820]  and relax the patient. L-theanine, a special amino acid naturally found in some tea leaves.
[03:45:13.820 --> 03:45:18.980]  The compound has been called the stress killer because of its powerful relaxation benefits.
[03:45:18.980 --> 03:45:23.380]  GABA, an important neurotransmitter that controls functions of the body and mind, including
[03:45:23.380 --> 03:45:28.140]  nervous system relaxation. GABA is a choice for many to help reduce anxiety.
[03:45:28.140 --> 03:45:34.420]  Rodeola rosea root extract. Found in the mountainous regions of Europe and Asia, this root is considered
[03:45:34.420 --> 03:45:39.620]  a super adaptogen and is believed to help the body in the fight against emotional, mental
[03:45:39.620 --> 03:45:43.900]  and physical stress. It's time to do what I did and take action with the chill force

[03:46:57.460 --> 03:47:04.460]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:47:04.460 --> 03:47:30.460]  Okay, um, just just a little bit more on this, uh, super hurricane, catty, catty, catty
[03:47:30.460 --> 03:47:36.220]  just a little bit more on this, uh, super hurricane, category five, 200 mile per hour
[03:47:36.220 --> 03:47:42.780]  winds, uh, Dorian in the Bahamas. You know, then it came up the Florida coast and we're
[03:47:42.780 --> 03:47:47.860]  very fortunate. It just stayed offshore. Now it's scraping along the Carolinas and might
[03:47:47.860 --> 03:47:52.940]  do a lot of damage there. But I can promise you right now in the, in the baham, northern
[03:47:52.940 --> 03:48:00.100]  Bahamas, just particularly that northern tier, the abacos and grand Bahama, there are people
[03:48:00.100 --> 03:48:07.100]  who are dying because they have no insulin. You know, the entire infrastructure of civilization
[03:48:07.100 --> 03:48:14.300]  was wrecked, just destroyed. They don't have drinking water. They don't have the very basics
[03:48:14.300 --> 03:48:20.980]  of life. They have the clothes on their backs and a lot of instant PTSD from surviving with
[03:48:20.980 --> 03:48:26.380]  their chins just above water, you know, with waves coming from all directions for, you
[03:48:26.380 --> 03:48:31.980]  know, for, uh, actually a couple of days. So please have some pity for these people.
[03:48:31.980 --> 03:48:36.820]  And then when you see legit charities that are going to help, that's fine. But the real
[03:48:36.820 --> 03:48:41.780]  thing is that there are people dying right now while we talk. There are people trapped
[03:48:41.780 --> 03:48:47.100]  and there are people without any medicine, without any water, uh, and it's, it's extremely
[03:48:47.100 --> 03:48:51.780]  dire. That's why I'm wearing this, uh, I got this, this medallion. It's actually a
[03:48:51.780 --> 03:48:58.780]  Wahoo fish. Um, I went to Virginia and they were the Wahoos, Cavaliers and the Wahoos.
[03:48:58.780 --> 03:49:03.380]  So I was in Marsh Harbor and I, and I saw this in a jewelry store and I picked it up.
[03:49:03.380 --> 03:49:08.740]  But, um, I guarantee you that jewelry store is gone. Just a foundation. The people that
[03:49:08.740 --> 03:49:14.020]  lived there that, you know, earned, earned their living, making jewelry, uh, uh, supported
[03:49:14.020 --> 03:49:18.700]  themselves, lived a great life in it and a really like a little paradise. That's all
[03:49:18.700 --> 03:49:25.100]  gone. And if those people are alive, they're homeless. It virtually beggars today, uh, waiting
[03:49:25.100 --> 03:49:29.980]  for hopefully Uncle Sam to come in, but it's going to take more than helicopters. They
[03:49:29.980 --> 03:49:36.620]  can't even get aircraft in the, the, uh, runway on the runway on, uh, near Freeport on Grand
[03:49:36.620 --> 03:49:42.980]  Bahama is, um, out of commission. The runway on Marsh Harbor, it's still underwater. Uh,
[03:49:42.980 --> 03:49:47.980]  the runway on treasure key, the roads cut off. It can't get anywhere except treasure key.
[03:49:47.980 --> 03:49:54.140]  So it's, it's an extremely dire situation. And it's a lesson for all of us about how,
[03:49:54.140 --> 03:50:01.020]  how rapidly a major natural catastrophe, like a bad earthquake or a super hurricane can
[03:50:01.020 --> 03:50:06.380]  just rip everything out that you're, you're depending on, including your survival supplies
[03:50:06.380 --> 03:50:11.980]  and then what? So it, it, it brings up a need for an even deeper level of preparation. You
[03:50:11.980 --> 03:50:16.300]  know, it's not enough to have stuff in a closet. If the closet's going to be wrecked, you
[03:50:16.300 --> 03:50:21.980]  know, by a natural disaster and the supplies, they are by a loss. So it makes me really
[03:50:21.980 --> 03:50:27.980]  think very deeply about, um, what I need in terms of food, water, medicine, emergency,
[03:50:27.980 --> 03:50:33.260]  um, supplies, much of which, um, we can get it in the info war store. But once you've
[03:50:33.260 --> 03:50:38.620]  bought it, give a good thought to preparing a place for it that won't be destroyed in
[03:50:38.620 --> 03:50:45.660]  an event of a natural disaster or a fire, for example. Okay. Nuff one Dorian. It's just,
[03:50:45.660 --> 03:50:52.300]  it's ripping me up watching those, um, videos of the abacus just ripping me up. They recently,
[03:50:52.300 --> 03:50:59.980]  um, this is like a week or two ago, a student, a 16 year old student in Loveland, Colorado
[03:50:59.980 --> 03:51:05.740]  posted pictures of a day at the range on social media. I think a Snapchat, something like
[03:51:05.740 --> 03:51:11.940]  that. Um, not even shooting, just like pictures of the guns that he had shot. And he was red
[03:51:11.940 --> 03:51:16.820]  flagged and basically, you know, kicked out of school for the time being. I think he's
[03:51:16.820 --> 03:51:22.780]  back now, but there's a program in Colorado. I don't know if it's in other places called
[03:51:22.780 --> 03:51:29.460]  safe to tell with the number two. It's basically a snitch hotline. If you think one of your
[03:51:29.460 --> 03:51:34.940]  fellow students is a, you know, potential, uh, you know, crazed shooter, like the Odessa
[03:51:34.940 --> 03:51:42.780]  shooter. And in this case, just the, the mere fact that you had photos taken of guns,
[03:51:42.780 --> 03:51:48.540]  legal guns, you know, legal training at a legal range was enough for the hysterics in
[03:51:48.540 --> 03:51:54.740]  that school to red flag this kid and get him booted. You know, and this points up this,
[03:51:54.740 --> 03:51:59.660]  this ties in, for example, with, with, um, the Walmart story where they're now putting
[03:51:59.660 --> 03:52:07.460]  a social stigma on guns, not vodka, you know, not rotgut whiskey on the bottom shelf, but
[03:52:07.460 --> 03:52:12.540]  guns are now going to become a pariah item. And if you, you know, if you enjoy shooting,
[03:52:12.540 --> 03:52:17.540]  if you, if you own guns, you're going to be considered some kind of a subspecies that
[03:52:17.540 --> 03:52:23.100]  bears a lot of, of watching because, you know, we're not quite sure when you might go off.
[03:52:23.100 --> 03:52:28.940]  And when you tie it in with this, with this, um, harpa, uh, the harpa deal, which is, you
[03:52:28.940 --> 03:52:35.420]  know, like DARPA for health, supposedly, uh, they're going to use, um, use AI and social
[03:52:35.420 --> 03:52:41.700]  media and, and, uh, put, put us all under the, you know, the remote control microscope
[03:52:41.700 --> 03:52:48.940]  to see which comrades are just a little bit too, um, you know, too unreliable to own guns.
[03:52:48.940 --> 03:52:56.420]  Now bad dangerous evil laws are always sold to the public in the name of public safety.
[03:52:56.420 --> 03:53:01.980]  In fact, during the French revolution, the guys with the guillotines were called the
[03:53:01.980 --> 03:53:07.100]  committee of public safety, literally. That's who was the guillotine crews, the committee
[03:53:07.100 --> 03:53:12.700]  of public safety. But when they, when they sell a new law, whether it's like asset forfeiture,
[03:53:12.700 --> 03:53:19.060]  oh, we're just going after Scarface and the big narco terrorist, uh, kingpins, they turn
[03:53:19.060 --> 03:53:24.500]  that, that's just the camel's nose inside of the tent. And so they're going to sell,
[03:53:24.500 --> 03:53:29.940]  including selling to Trump, you know, Ivanka and, uh, and those, those losers, they're
[03:53:29.940 --> 03:53:36.260]  going to sell Trump on some form of red flag law. And it doesn't matter how it's worded.
[03:53:36.260 --> 03:53:44.300]  It doesn't matter what kind of guarantees there are. It's just the camel's nose. Eventually
[03:53:44.300 --> 03:53:50.220]  there'll be a democratic, a Democrat president and the, the, the structure of the red flag
[03:53:50.220 --> 03:53:59.020]  law that's passed now in 2019 or 2020 is going to just be enormously vastly expanded to where
[03:53:59.020 --> 03:54:03.940]  if you're, if you're a white male heterosexual with guns, that's pretty much going to be
[03:54:03.940 --> 03:54:09.140]  enough to do it. I mean, you think that I'm joking. You think I'm using hyperbole. Well,
[03:54:09.140 --> 03:54:14.100]  when I wrote my novels, you know, 10, 15 years ago, nobody could have ever foreseen something
[03:54:14.100 --> 03:54:19.940]  like, you know, secret police teams doing evil deeds like Fast and Furious, but they
[03:54:19.940 --> 03:54:25.940]  did. Nobody could have foreseen, you know, public, public libraries, bringing in pedophile
[03:54:25.940 --> 03:54:34.180]  drag queens to, to, you know, play horsey with, with toddlers and small children, but
[03:54:34.180 --> 03:54:40.820]  they're doing it. So people have to pretty much, you know, expand their, their horizon
[03:54:40.820 --> 03:54:46.180]  of the possible. And when something sounds like hyperbole, like the, you know, the red
[03:54:46.180 --> 03:54:51.820]  flag laws are going to be used to disarm conservatives, just think back 10 years. Would you have ever
[03:54:51.820 --> 03:54:56.780]  imagined that, that, you know, homosexual marriage, oh, that's all we want, gays to be
[03:54:56.780 --> 03:55:03.940]  able to marry, would expand so quickly to trans, transgenders, winning female sports
[03:55:03.940 --> 03:55:09.980]  events, weightlifting, track, etc. It sounds crazy, but here we are. So it's, it doesn't
[03:55:09.980 --> 03:55:16.500]  take much of a stretch of the imagination to extrapolate forward just a couple of years
[03:55:16.500 --> 03:55:23.540]  when there's a, imagine a president Bernie Sanders or Kamala Harris or Elizabeth Warren,
[03:55:23.540 --> 03:55:29.380]  they're going to use these, these laws that are passed today in the midst of a hysteria
[03:55:29.380 --> 03:55:34.420]  to disarm their political enemies. This is how it's always done. You can, you can go
[03:55:34.420 --> 03:55:40.820]  back to, you know, through the 20th century, every group that was a victim of genocide
[03:55:40.820 --> 03:55:48.260]  went through a period of scapegoating, you know, and the, one of the tools that these
[03:55:48.260 --> 03:55:55.020]  oppressive dictators have used to not only scapegoat their, their enemies that are going
[03:55:55.020 --> 03:56:01.180]  to be designated for genocide, but they use the tool of gun registration and they'll never
[03:56:01.180 --> 03:56:07.340]  say gun registration is so that we can round up the guns from our political enemies and
[03:56:07.340 --> 03:56:12.820]  put them on boxcars. That's never going to happen. They always say, we need to know who
[03:56:12.820 --> 03:56:18.060]  has all the guns so that we can keep them out of the hands of irresponsible, you know,
[03:56:18.060 --> 03:56:22.940]  maniacs and criminals, which doesn't work because criminals, for example, are going to
[03:56:22.940 --> 03:56:27.740]  get guns illegally, no matter what. They're, the next thing that we're going to see is,
[03:56:27.740 --> 03:56:33.420]  is that a ban on private sales, you're going to have to go to a federal firearms license
[03:56:33.420 --> 03:56:39.500]  dealer and do the paperwork. This is only going to affect law abiding citizens. It won't
[03:56:39.500 --> 03:56:44.660]  change criminal behavior at all. They're still going to buy trunk, cars out of the trunks
[03:56:44.660 --> 03:56:50.940]  of cars like they always do, but it's going to put conservatives, law abiding people into
[03:56:50.940 --> 03:56:57.300]  the position of either virtually registering all of their guns because every transfer will
[03:56:57.300 --> 03:57:01.380]  have to be reported to the federal government. And you know, no matter what they say, they
[03:57:01.380 --> 03:57:06.900]  keep, they keep those records forever. Or you're going to still do private sales, but
[03:57:06.900 --> 03:57:12.620]  you're going to risk a felony sting, you know, of some kind of a bust for a sting and be
[03:57:12.620 --> 03:57:18.420]  a felon and go to prison hard time. So this is the corner that we're being pushed into.
[03:57:18.420 --> 03:57:25.740]  And I, I wrote an article for American partisan today, basically called Dear Mr. Security
[03:57:25.740 --> 03:57:32.260]  Agency, Dear Mr. Security Agent, please go see it. It's about gun confiscation and who's
[03:57:32.260 --> 03:57:36.540]  going to be responsible for the gun confiscation is going to be the police. They're going
[03:57:36.540 --> 03:57:42.220]  to have a big question to ask themselves when that time comes. And I'll see you next
[03:57:42.220 --> 03:57:58.300]  Thursday.
