[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:20.840]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:20.840 --> 00:31.160]  look I know that we're going into a planned worldwide tyranny a new dark age
[00:31.160 --> 00:38.320]  destroying true libertarian liberal ideas packaged under the modern pseudo
[00:38.320 --> 00:45.160]  liberalism but when I sit here and read headlines like this out of rasmussen
[00:45.160 --> 00:50.000]  dot com rasmussen reports one of the biggest polling agencies in the world
[00:50.000 --> 00:54.940]  and it's not us warning of this a decade ago it's not the academics and
[00:54.940 --> 01:00.080]  governments calling for it newspapers it's it's serious polls with a large
[01:00.080 --> 01:07.120]  percentage of people wanting to arrest anyone that disagrees with man-made
[01:07.120 --> 01:11.200]  climate change first it was freezing then it was warming now it's change and
[01:11.200 --> 01:17.560]  this is just today's stack I have a huge stack here of what they call political
[01:17.560 --> 01:22.000]  correctness it's not political correctness it is the talitarianism it is
[01:22.000 --> 01:32.400]  Mao Zedong it's Adolf Hitler it's happening again now it's only 20
[01:32.400 --> 01:41.640]  something percent that in this poll want to arrest everybody but that's
[01:41.640 --> 01:47.280]  still a whacked out group of scum with their bizarre moral authority and you
[01:47.280 --> 01:50.760]  see it going on these universities where somebody drove by on a truck two
[01:50.760 --> 01:54.240]  months ago I think I heard something racist and there's a Thomas Jefferson
[01:54.240 --> 02:00.400]  statue get rid of everybody in the school lock everything down and now it's
[02:00.400 --> 02:04.000]  happening all over the country they're routing particularly black conservative
[02:04.000 --> 02:12.920]  professors and it is just a mindless power grab by the feminist commanding the
[02:12.920 --> 02:18.200]  young throngs of chip on the shoulder youth we've done an analysis of it all
[02:18.200 --> 02:25.680]  Ford Foundation Soros manipulated and it's just pathetic to see these people
[02:25.680 --> 02:29.920]  will not get jobs anywhere I don't care if it's a young white woman a young white
[02:29.920 --> 02:33.760]  guy black woman whatever I'm looking at these people they're not getting
[02:33.760 --> 02:38.480]  education so they're not learning how to make connections and get jobs to so much
[02:38.480 --> 02:41.960]  of business is just interpersonal skill even Bloomberg had an article on that a
[02:41.960 --> 02:48.520]  month ago three and a half weeks ago these people are completely whacked out
[02:48.520 --> 02:56.640]  they are psychologically destroyed they've had their normal social skills
[02:56.640 --> 03:04.200]  basically degraded or removed to seeing phantoms in fact I saw a political
[03:04.200 --> 03:08.960]  cartoon it may still be on info wars.com or the political cartoons down on the
[03:08.960 --> 03:15.200]  lower left-hand side and it shows a psychiatrist holding up the ink blot
[03:15.200 --> 03:23.280]  test and saying what do you see and I see racism I see homophobia I see this I
[03:23.280 --> 03:30.160]  see that no matter what the blobs on the page said look like that's what they see
[03:31.640 --> 03:38.080]  and that's what it is and that's the plan this is how you put a virus in a
[03:38.080 --> 03:44.920]  computer to fry people's brains little support for pushing little support for
[03:44.920 --> 03:49.640]  punishing global warming foes global warming advocates are calling for the
[03:49.640 --> 03:54.720]  prosecution of groups who disagree with them and the New York state has taken it
[03:54.720 --> 04:01.280]  a step further by investigating people now I'm gonna come back and cover all
[04:01.280 --> 04:08.760]  this but I can't even believe it's gone this far and what's even sicker is its
[04:08.760 --> 04:19.160]  Exxon mobile and British Petroleum and Dutch Royal Shell those three are the
[04:19.160 --> 04:25.920]  biggest funders of the whole man-made climate change garbage to shut down
[04:25.920 --> 04:32.160]  coal their main competitor and they're so sophisticated the left doesn't even
[04:32.160 --> 04:36.200]  know they work for them and then they have New York State investigating Exxon
[04:36.200 --> 04:42.440]  mobile claiming they paid for fake science it wasn't fake science that was
[04:42.440 --> 04:48.080]  15 years ago they were ordered by the board head David Rockefeller to convert
[04:48.080 --> 04:54.120]  and support it and they have since then incredible incredible this is just
[04:54.120 --> 05:02.720]  incredible the oil companies run the fraud Marco Rubio the new billionaire
[05:02.720 --> 05:06.920]  boy toy was left speechless on the fourth GOP debate when Rand Paul called
[05:06.920 --> 05:11.040]  him on his absurd pandering to the military industrial complex and his
[05:11.040 --> 05:17.840]  attempt to outdo Hillary Clinton with free college rebuild the American
[05:17.840 --> 05:22.320]  military seriously Rubio but you know we spend more on our military than the
[05:22.320 --> 05:25.960]  next 10 countries combined I know that Rand is a committed isolationist from
[05:25.960 --> 05:29.920]  Marco's perspective if you don't have more than the 7 Obama Wars going you're
[05:29.920 --> 05:34.120]  an isolationist perhaps it'd be safer if we were involved in 10 wars or maybe
[05:34.120 --> 05:39.240]  even better picked a fight with Russia so Rubio's masters could catch in Marco
[05:39.240 --> 05:43.680]  how is it conservative how is it conservative to add a trillion-dollar
[05:43.680 --> 05:47.640]  expenditure for the federal government that's not paying for how is it
[05:47.640 --> 05:52.160]  conservative how is it conservative to add a trillion dollars in military
[05:52.160 --> 05:55.460]  expenditures you cannot be a conservative if you're gonna keep

[07:59.680 --> 08:14.760]  live from Austin, Texas broadcasting
[08:14.760 --> 08:19.720]  live it's Alex Jones
[08:21.160 --> 08:25.840]  ladies and gentlemen thank you so much for joining us on this Thursday the 12th
[08:25.840 --> 08:35.160]  day of November 2015 I'm your host Alex Jones we have obviously a lot of over
[08:35.160 --> 08:40.440]  the top as usual important news to cover Professor Daryl Hamamoto out in
[08:40.440 --> 08:44.920]  California a few years ago began to expose what he called just mass total
[08:44.920 --> 08:52.160]  mental illness total tyranny where the students are being turned into malice
[08:52.160 --> 08:58.040]  style lynch mobs who demand everyone submit to them and accept their
[08:58.040 --> 09:06.040]  particular bizarre dogma of leftism or you are basically hounded and they try
[09:06.040 --> 09:11.240]  to burn you at the stake now Hamamoto is a classical liberal freedom
[09:11.240 --> 09:18.280]  tolerance Thomas Jefferson style but he was able to stop them from having him
[09:18.280 --> 09:22.520]  thrown off the faculty and he will be joining us to talk about the nightmare
[09:22.520 --> 09:27.920]  that is unfolding across this country at universities he's also a recipient of
[09:27.920 --> 09:31.080]  the Rockefeller Foundation research fellowship so he's been on the inside
[09:31.080 --> 09:36.120]  at UCLA Fulbright scholar he goes on and on I'm not gonna go over his he's a top
[09:36.120 --> 09:44.880]  professor used to head up one of the main departments still does so University
[09:44.880 --> 09:49.840]  California Davis and Larry Nichols will be joining us he's in ill health was
[09:49.840 --> 09:54.040]  gonna be on a few weeks ago we had some issues there but he'll be joining us
[09:54.040 --> 09:58.400]  today and I really think this is a case of pearls before swine I don't mean our
[09:58.400 --> 10:02.160]  general audience but the mainstream media it's such a big deal when Larry
[10:02.160 --> 10:08.080]  Nichols comes on I mean he was on record one of the main political operatives
[10:08.080 --> 10:12.400]  and handlers of the Clintons when they were co-governor basically he witnessed
[10:12.400 --> 10:18.600]  a cocaine being shipped in he witnessed the murders I mean all of it and some
[10:18.600 --> 10:21.960]  people sit there and say well I mean this is a horrible guy why are you
[10:21.960 --> 10:27.480]  having him on the point is it's the prodigal son he got out of it when he
[10:27.480 --> 10:30.600]  was gonna be going to the White House when he was gonna be going up the chain
[10:30.600 --> 10:37.840]  of command and he had that Saul of Tarsus moment on the road to Damascus
[10:37.840 --> 10:43.680]  where he hid his knees and repent it and then and so what happens to him is
[10:43.680 --> 10:48.000]  between Larry Nichols and God the point is he's been a major thorn on their side
[10:48.000 --> 10:51.600]  for a long time so he'll be joining us and he is a bit eccentric you know he is
[10:51.600 --> 10:56.080]  battling lung cancer right now I'm not gonna get all the details of it but
[10:56.080 --> 11:01.280]  let's just say this he's been fighting for his life he's done the do not
[11:01.280 --> 11:04.160]  resuscitate deal he's gotten down to that point now but he's going to be
[11:04.160 --> 11:08.600]  joining us so definitely pray for him and and try to support him as well but
[11:08.600 --> 11:11.480]  the prayers are what's most important and then Anthony you see already will be
[11:11.480 --> 11:18.000]  hosting the fourth hour of overdrive you know what I'm gonna do this morning I
[11:18.000 --> 11:22.000]  got up I couldn't sleep last night for some reason went to bed like two in the
[11:22.000 --> 11:28.560]  morning I'm about six and I just sat there reading what was coming into my
[11:28.560 --> 11:33.720]  email from listeners the tips and I was looking on the Facebook and info wars
[11:33.720 --> 11:45.960]  and drudge and I just sat back about 7 30 in the morning and it clicked I was
[11:45.960 --> 11:50.800]  like this really is the offensive this really is the big takeover this really
[11:50.800 --> 11:57.600]  is the big distraction while they are robbing the country and the planet right
[11:57.600 --> 12:02.440]  now and establishing an above-the-law diplomatically immune corporate world
[12:02.440 --> 12:09.480]  government that hates humanity in its own words and I laugh at the politically
[12:09.480 --> 12:15.120]  correct people I I say mean things about them and they deserve it but really I
[12:15.120 --> 12:24.520]  didn't really cry this morning I cried in my mind I cried in my gut when I
[12:24.520 --> 12:29.920]  looked at the videos of the politically correct throngs at Yale and Dartmouth
[12:29.920 --> 12:37.880]  and Missouri State they were desperate they were scared they were freaked out
[12:37.880 --> 12:42.960]  they were raised by television they weren't taught how to change light bulbs
[12:42.960 --> 12:48.360]  much less fix a carburetor they never grew gardens in their yard I don't care
[12:48.360 --> 12:56.920]  they were black or white they were slaves they were desperate at Missouri State
[12:56.920 --> 13:00.000]  and jacari and kid Daniels were there yesterday and that was really the story
[13:00.000 --> 13:04.720]  hiding in plain view it was like the last man on earth there were these
[13:04.720 --> 13:11.040]  video shots of these huge commons and these beautiful classical colonial
[13:11.040 --> 13:18.160]  red brick buildings and you might see one person 300 yards away walking those
[13:18.160 --> 13:25.800]  just in some shots no one on a Wednesday in the middle of the class year and then
[13:25.800 --> 13:29.480]  I sat there last night and then this morning for like three four hours
[13:29.480 --> 13:38.520]  watching the raw videos from their black lives matter sites and others and I
[13:38.520 --> 13:43.200]  realized these aren't even bad people on average these are really screwed up
[13:43.200 --> 13:51.000]  damaged victims of of reeducation camp brainwashing when they heard that the
[13:51.000 --> 13:58.680]  Klan was going to show up at the university the federally run Klan I
[13:58.680 --> 14:02.040]  mean I've gone and protest the Klan more than 20 times there's usually about six
[14:02.040 --> 14:11.400]  or seven guys it comes out later that they're all feds it's a joke it's a
[14:11.400 --> 14:16.360]  photo opt to stir up racial tension and that's come out the Southern Prairie Law
[14:16.360 --> 14:19.480]  Center and other groups have been connected behind it and white
[14:19.480 --> 14:22.840]  supremacist centers like Elohim City or run by them and the government I mean
[14:22.840 --> 14:28.960]  this is sick and I watched videos of the football players and the basketball
[14:28.960 --> 14:33.240]  players and the and the students running and fear and panicking jacari had
[14:33.240 --> 14:38.600]  people run up to him and say is it true is it true is the Klan here aren't we
[14:38.600 --> 14:44.680]  safe and they canceled classes had the police on alert that means SWAT team on
[14:44.680 --> 14:51.120]  the roof and it was all completely made up but meanwhile the very same football
[14:51.120 --> 14:54.600]  players and basketball players would intimidate members of the press and run
[14:54.600 --> 14:58.520]  over them because see they weren't threatening see it's all this simulated
[14:58.520 --> 15:05.280]  WIMP warfare tribal warfare at the most base level these are people that want to
[15:05.280 --> 15:10.880]  have a coming-of-age event and you watch all these confused wide-eyed looks like
[15:10.880 --> 15:16.280]  18-year-old girls black white I don't really see any Hispanics and then
[15:16.280 --> 15:22.880]  black men and white men and professors female and male prodding and bullying I
[15:22.880 --> 15:34.080]  mean this is just a sick group of people disconnected from reality I mean if I was
[15:34.080 --> 15:39.800]  the football team it's like 80% black and I didn't like the Klan which nobody
[15:39.800 --> 15:44.120]  showed up it wasn't true it was made up in that rumor you're looking for trouble
[15:44.120 --> 15:46.840]  go I mean you want to do I'm not saying do it but go beat the hell out of them
[15:46.840 --> 15:50.040]  what are you afraid of
[15:51.560 --> 15:57.680]  but see that's it they literally are scared of somebody in a truck driving by
[15:57.680 --> 16:08.480]  and thinking they heard something racist or a poop swastika and I experienced
[16:08.480 --> 16:11.760]  this on Halloween I don't go out when we celebrate Halloween it's a cultic holiday
[16:11.760 --> 16:16.760]  but I went to my cousin's birthday party and I wore a captain's hat and I had a
[16:16.760 --> 16:21.640]  white person and an Arab person come up and get in my face aggressively and I
[16:21.640 --> 16:24.920]  was nice at first but then I would turn to them and I got in their face and I
[16:24.920 --> 16:30.400]  said watch it man don't push your talitarianism on me I said so what if I
[16:30.400 --> 16:35.120]  am a Nazi but I said you know I'm not a Nazi you know that's a that's a captain's
[16:35.120 --> 16:38.240]  hat you just want to act official have me kiss your butt well I'm not going to do
[16:38.240 --> 16:44.080]  it and how dare you get in my face and imply I'm a Nazi
[16:47.000 --> 16:51.840]  you don't have some moral high ground by getting in my face now I suggest you
[16:51.840 --> 16:55.640]  turn around and you walk away fast
[16:56.680 --> 17:03.160]  you do that these people run but everybody else faculty there was
[17:03.160 --> 17:10.200]  meanwhile they hear the clans coming and piss their drawers running folks because
[17:10.200 --> 17:14.400]  it's another imaginary boogeyman and I see all these these adults and these are
[17:14.400 --> 17:20.200]  like 18 to 23 year old people on average and they've had so little life
[17:20.200 --> 17:24.560]  experiences that they're scared that a Halloween party might have something
[17:24.560 --> 17:28.040]  that's offensive and are screaming in fear
[17:28.040 --> 17:38.560]  I mean this is crazy and then I've got stacks of articles where they're in
[17:38.560 --> 17:44.800]  mainstream news in the United States and have national polls normalizing the
[17:44.800 --> 17:53.560]  arrest of anyone for political speech that's not seen as kosher if you deny
[17:53.560 --> 17:57.720]  man-made global warming you are to be arrested that is in Rasmussen polls
[17:57.720 --> 18:03.960]  they're actually polling with a straight face imagine a poll saying let's
[18:03.960 --> 18:09.360]  arrest all the I don't know think of a group all the seeks imagine having an
[18:09.360 --> 18:12.760]  actual poll about should we round up all the seeks I'm just taking a random
[18:12.760 --> 18:19.320]  group I mean no one would even run that poll you talk about dangerous this is
[18:19.320 --> 18:27.080]  the Talitarianism and I've got stacks of these articles this was all cooked up by
[18:27.080 --> 18:32.880]  psych warfare teams that's all declassified to totally fracture this
[18:32.880 --> 18:39.560]  country while we're being taken over when a mosquito pushes its proboscis into
[18:39.560 --> 18:44.800]  your flesh it's a two-way nozzle it pumps acids saliva into your body that's
[18:44.800 --> 18:50.000]  what itches and hurts but it's time delayed by the time it gets away with
[18:50.000 --> 18:53.800]  the blood then you feel it it dissolves your blood cells makes them not plate
[18:53.800 --> 18:57.200]  together and sucks them up and that's what political correctness is is the
[18:57.200 --> 19:02.320]  globalist sticking its snout in pumping this in to divide all of us so they can
[19:02.320 --> 19:08.680]  slurp us up that's it oh they're real race problems and real all less of the
[19:08.680 --> 19:12.680]  but the point is it's projected it's expanded it's used to traumatize to
[19:12.680 --> 19:17.040]  rub salt in the wounds in a sickeningly cynical way while they rob us with
[19:17.040 --> 19:23.760]  Obamacare and the TPP and world government and all the rest the craziness
[19:23.760 --> 19:29.360]  then they have headlines like little support for punishing global warming
[19:29.360 --> 19:36.480]  folks in America if you say global warming is an anthropogenic should you
[19:36.480 --> 19:43.280]  be arrested and they sit there with a straight face see how they just put that
[19:43.280 --> 19:48.320]  out there and then you've got people running around hysterical in fear
[19:48.320 --> 19:53.880]  beyond the Salem witch trucks stumbling over each other the clan is coming the
[19:53.880 --> 19:59.840]  clan let's run let's run let's run like the running of the bowls
[20:00.840 --> 20:06.480]  earthquake floods winter storms prolonged power outages or war each of us
[20:06.480 --> 20:10.480]  have had that moment when we recognize that we need to be better prepared we
[20:10.480 --> 20:13.680]  typically do the same thing we start with food storage then we address the
[20:13.680 --> 20:17.960]  need for water but have you considered heat storage I'm talking about staying
[20:17.960 --> 20:22.200]  warm in the cold here are some things for you to consider how will I keep my
[20:22.200 --> 20:26.240]  family warm the standard answers are firewood coal or propane but the problem
[20:26.240 --> 20:30.720]  with that if you need to be on the move is you can't take it with you another
[20:30.720 --> 20:34.600]  concern there may come a time when you need to stay warm without smoke like in
[20:34.600 --> 20:38.680]  times of war there may even come a time when you can't burn fuel the answers

[22:19.280 --> 22:23.520]  made predictions like this before a few years ago I warned that the housing
[22:23.520 --> 22:28.080]  prices would collapse before that I warned that dot-com companies would
[22:28.080 --> 22:33.200]  crash and they did those who listened had a chance to save themselves but this

[24:21.600 --> 24:28.920]  tyranny's greatest foe is classical liberalism which comes out of the
[24:28.920 --> 24:36.320]  Christian ethic which comes out of our Judeo-Christian past and so many people
[24:36.320 --> 24:43.320]  to cause celeb the fun thing is to hate Jews and bash Israel all day I'm neutral
[24:43.320 --> 24:48.040]  on the issue because I won't play the games but we are a Judeo-Christian
[24:48.040 --> 24:54.680]  nation I know that's been popularized in the last 50 years the term wasn't
[24:54.680 --> 24:59.520]  really used before that and I could see some of the debate from purist
[24:59.520 --> 25:03.480]  Christians that say we're mainly a Christian nation well that's true but
[25:03.480 --> 25:09.320]  Christianity comes out of the older Old Testament form of Judaism before it was
[25:09.320 --> 25:13.280]  corrupted during the Babylonian captivity and others that Judaism
[25:13.280 --> 25:18.240]  compared to the old Judaism is two different animals entirely just like
[25:18.240 --> 25:27.240]  you can say America was different in 1776 than it is today but I didn't mean to
[25:27.240 --> 25:34.240]  digress off into a mini history lesson what I was getting at is true liberalism
[25:34.240 --> 25:41.440]  true individualism true free association is so diverse so powerful so
[25:41.440 --> 25:47.120]  productive so magical that tyrants hate it because they believe competition is a
[25:47.120 --> 25:52.760]  sin and so they had to take over the Renaissance that was America the
[25:52.760 --> 25:56.400]  greatest expression of the Renaissance and our innovations and our
[25:56.400 --> 26:02.200]  exceptionalism and the globalist had to subvert it and collectivize it and then
[26:02.200 --> 26:05.880]  take the abolitionist movement that continued on to the civil rights
[26:05.880 --> 26:13.040]  movement and twist it into a race-based movement it is today where black students
[26:13.040 --> 26:18.880]  across the United States and Hispanic students in public schools in primary
[26:18.880 --> 26:25.440]  and secondary right through K through 12 right through to graduate right through
[26:25.440 --> 26:33.200]  the PhD they are self-segregating and saying white allies are not allowed to
[26:33.200 --> 26:37.720]  come to this yoga class that's the sick little term whites are bad but if you're
[26:37.720 --> 26:41.920]  an ally and grovel properly you're okay what is having a white person grovel to
[26:41.920 --> 26:47.400]  you do they're just as pathetic poor and stupid as you are I've seen the
[26:47.400 --> 26:54.760]  statistics the average white person is collapsing into poverty has no idea what's
[26:54.760 --> 26:59.200]  going on hates themselves and then I have to sit here as a white man that knows
[26:59.200 --> 27:04.680]  this growing up around it and hear from me you how I'm hiding my racism and how
[27:04.680 --> 27:11.720]  I'm hiding my my privilege and all this crap
[27:12.560 --> 27:16.240]  let me tell you what my privilege was my privilege was being singled out because
[27:16.240 --> 27:19.720]  I was so good-looking I'm not very good-looking now I was super good-looking
[27:19.720 --> 27:25.520]  I look like a Calvin Klein model when I'm from I was about 14 to 23 go look at
[27:25.520 --> 27:31.000]  the photos online I'd walk into a room and almost every woman in the room would
[27:31.000 --> 27:35.960]  just turn their head but let me tell you I had to fight men continually because
[27:35.960 --> 27:38.600]  they didn't like it they didn't like pretty boy they thought they were gonna
[27:38.600 --> 27:44.640]  kick my butt whether they were black Hispanic or white I faced it all and I
[27:44.640 --> 27:49.560]  watched these little slack jobs snot nose punk kids shit over there and
[27:49.560 --> 27:54.240]  complain about all the stuff they've been through all the ringleader is jacked in
[27:54.240 --> 28:02.080]  with Soros and Warren Buffett and his daddy made $8.2 million last year my
[28:02.080 --> 28:10.120]  daddy didn't make $8 million in the last 20 years I am sick of this garbage the
[28:10.120 --> 28:16.040]  idea that if you're white you can't accomplish anything on your own is a
[28:16.040 --> 28:31.960]  load of bull totally and completely deranged and I want to help all these
[28:31.960 --> 28:37.600]  people I understand metaphysically spiritually but an organic level I'm
[28:37.600 --> 28:43.240]  already set right genuinely believe it but even if I was a bad person I would
[28:43.240 --> 28:46.720]  want others to succeed because I understand you reap what you sow the
[28:46.720 --> 28:50.560]  problem is evil people don't understand that metaphysical rule and they want to
[28:50.560 --> 28:57.480]  see others fail they believe they succeed when other people fail and it's
[28:57.480 --> 29:03.680]  some primitive levels that's true in every culture but not at higher orders
[29:03.680 --> 29:12.880]  and humanity dreams group dreams to manifest the future not through some
[29:12.880 --> 29:16.800]  magical incantation but through the fact that we're made in the image of the
[29:16.800 --> 29:24.920]  creator of the universe and are able to then manifest through our mass movements
[29:24.920 --> 29:31.400]  and our collective dreams to build castles in the sky and instead you've
[29:31.400 --> 29:37.360]  got a bunch of mentally ill fear-stricken gibbering cowardly people
[29:37.360 --> 29:42.680]  running in fear and stumbling and evacuating because the clan was
[29:42.680 --> 29:47.560]  supposedly going to show up the wicked flea when none pursue we'll be back

[34:02.400 --> 34:05.840]  headlines instead of pontificating and I've got world events economic stuff
[34:05.840 --> 34:11.440]  guests coming up little support for punishing global warming foes rest
[34:11.440 --> 34:17.760]  moosen reports dot com this is the stuff you'd read in Nazi Germany in like
[34:17.760 --> 34:25.400]  1938 if you denied something the government said was official that you
[34:25.400 --> 34:29.960]  had discussions about arresting people then for it global warming advocates are
[34:29.960 --> 34:34.640]  calling for the prosecution of groups who disagree with them and the New York
[34:34.640 --> 34:39.080]  state has taken it a step further by investigating ExxonMobil for refusing to
[34:39.080 --> 34:46.520]  pay play ball with the popular science theory well that's not even accurate
[34:46.520 --> 34:51.640]  ExxonMobil was one of the only big 10 and it was the biggest oil company in
[34:51.640 --> 34:55.960]  the world at the time in fact it wasn't ExxonMobil then it was Exxon Rex
[34:55.960 --> 35:00.840]  Tillerson headed it he continued once it was ExxonMobil but David Rockefeller
[35:00.840 --> 35:05.160]  came in 15 years ago you can look it up and then again about a decade ago was in
[35:05.160 --> 35:09.320]  the Associated Press got no attention but I remember covering it on air and came
[35:09.320 --> 35:13.560]  in and called in all the shares fired a bunch of the board and said I will remove
[35:13.560 --> 35:18.360]  you Rex Tillerson you will support carbon taxes you will do this and Tillerson
[35:18.360 --> 35:23.840]  said okay we'll cease our investigations that carbon dioxide doesn't eat the
[35:23.840 --> 35:31.120]  planet fine of course it doesn't but even before that Dutch Royal Shell Exxon
[35:31.120 --> 35:37.200]  is a big competitor BP which is sister companies owned by the same royal
[35:37.200 --> 35:42.320]  families Dutch and British are the same people it's German they're antecedents
[35:42.320 --> 35:48.720]  Germans and all the other big oil companies for at least 30 years have
[35:48.720 --> 35:54.360]  been funding this banned carbon dioxide garbage because coal puts out many many
[35:54.360 --> 35:59.000]  many many times depending on which type of coal more carbon dioxide than fuel
[35:59.000 --> 36:06.400]  than gasoline or diesel and I'm not invested in coal I'm not invested in
[36:06.400 --> 36:12.320]  oil I'm not invested in natural gas I don't have a dog in this hunt and
[36:12.320 --> 36:18.400]  every time I talk about this people send me emails or there's comments of the
[36:18.400 --> 36:23.440]  press oh he must be getting money from the oil companies until the last decade
[36:23.440 --> 36:27.040]  or so my family got no money from the oil companies in fact Texas they drill
[36:27.040 --> 36:31.880]  them everywhere actually my family has some small gas wells that almost don't
[36:31.880 --> 36:35.520]  pay anything I wish they did I've never gotten any of the money it's just used
[36:35.520 --> 36:37.960]  to basically pay property taxes what they do now is they raise your property
[36:37.960 --> 36:41.560]  taxes so much we got a gas well and they'll say over the life what they think
[36:41.560 --> 36:45.000]  the wells worth but gas prices are so low you almost lose money unless it's a
[36:45.000 --> 36:53.120]  huge one but it's the gas lobby also with big oil lobbying to shut down coal so
[36:53.120 --> 36:59.160]  technically if I thought like a parasite I think you know my dad will be dead in
[36:59.160 --> 37:02.760]  20 years I hope he isn't but you know my dad will be gone in 20 years and I
[37:02.760 --> 37:07.400]  might have some gas wells out on the family farm in East Texas and boy I
[37:07.400 --> 37:10.880]  want to get rid of coal because I'll make more money because coal is my main
[37:10.880 --> 37:16.360]  competition show show in the weird schizoid way people think I always hear
[37:16.360 --> 37:21.280]  the average person who isn't the stock market or whatever they'll say I don't
[37:21.280 --> 37:25.680]  care the stock market goes down all those rich people go bankrupt I don't care
[37:25.680 --> 37:29.760]  the whole economy's tied to it almost every company but again the average
[37:29.760 --> 37:33.840]  yuppie will say I've run into him I don't care that goes down the average
[37:33.840 --> 37:38.400]  liberal who's you know anti quote money they won't even realize that if it goes
[37:38.400 --> 37:42.280]  belly up even though it's a bubble that's gonna really hurt them that they
[37:42.280 --> 37:47.820]  just only think about themselves in this weird little focus mindlessness there's
[37:47.820 --> 37:51.360]  enough coal to run our in current civilization for thousands of years
[37:51.360 --> 37:55.400]  they've perfected it and know how to use it completely clean totally clean
[37:55.400 --> 38:02.640]  totally Earth's energy crisis is solved and and within a few years if they
[38:02.640 --> 38:06.240]  wouldn't suppress it we'll have other totally clean energies I want to bring
[38:06.240 --> 38:15.000]  those out but I've studied it and it's wrong to have Obama get up and say
[38:15.000 --> 38:21.920]  we're gonna bankrupt coal you can build a plant but we will bankrupt you when
[38:21.920 --> 38:25.840]  China and India and everybody else has to make zero cuts but every Western
[38:25.840 --> 38:32.680]  country has to we can't compete if our electricity is ten times what it is in
[38:32.680 --> 38:38.240]  China look it up on average ten times just a decade ago we were close to on par
[38:38.240 --> 38:43.840]  with China do you realize what that does to America to jack up our power price I
[38:43.840 --> 38:51.200]  mean it's real simple it's elementary that's why harp on this so much we cannot
[38:51.200 --> 38:56.640]  compete it is discriminatory that we can't have power plants that are clean
[38:56.640 --> 39:00.160]  and then they just move over the border to Mexico and run completely dirty and
[39:00.160 --> 39:04.480]  rain mercury down on us I'm not against the Mexicans they should have clean
[39:04.480 --> 39:11.000]  cold the point is is that it's wrong to shut down over 50 Texas power plants in
[39:11.000 --> 39:14.880]  the last seven years look it up out of the close to thousand shut down
[39:14.880 --> 39:21.960]  nationwide and then Mexico and then have the very companies moved to Mexico
[39:21.960 --> 39:28.720]  it's a military attack what did Putin say two weeks ago it's a military attack
[39:28.720 --> 39:39.040]  because that's what it is people that's what it is it's robbing you to hurt you
[39:39.040 --> 39:43.800]  our government doesn't want you to have cheap energy and they put up fake wind
[39:43.800 --> 39:49.800]  mills and all this garbage that creates more destruction doesn't work was it
[39:49.800 --> 39:56.400]  meant to work a pure boondoggle to their friends so they can act like they're
[39:56.400 --> 39:59.440]  bringing you alternative energy oh we're getting rid of coal to make you
[39:59.440 --> 40:02.400]  switch to this and then they really don't give us the better energy systems
[40:02.400 --> 40:07.440]  that are there and now they want to arrest people and I tell people about
[40:07.440 --> 40:09.720]  this 10 years ago when they were first calling for it at the UN people didn't
[40:09.720 --> 40:14.560]  believe me oh they're not gonna arrest you and they're now basically telling
[40:14.560 --> 40:18.440]  Lord Monks and others don't even try to come to Paris they're gonna get Lord
[40:18.440 --> 40:22.720]  Monks on ahead of this climate this world government summit next next month in
[40:22.720 --> 40:30.760]  Paris and they tried to keep him out of other countries he's an amazing guy he
[40:30.760 --> 40:37.080]  he parachuted into the one in Durban South Africa because they wouldn't let him
[40:37.080 --> 40:42.560]  in they had a whole area of the city shut down so he skydived into it never
[40:42.560 --> 40:48.240]  skydive before that's daring that's a stunt he could he was in dozens and
[40:48.240 --> 40:53.560]  dozens of front page papers in South Africa with that one and that's all we
[40:53.560 --> 40:57.920]  need you to do is the same bold stunts against these dragons and we'll bring
[40:57.920 --> 41:02.280]  them down folks if we're successful in not letting them shut off the third
[41:02.280 --> 41:06.840]  world's power that's where they're really targeting them right now because they
[41:06.840 --> 41:10.200]  let them have it in India and places like that in China but in oh in Africa and
[41:10.200 --> 41:13.200]  in Latin America in areas they're not letting them have it it's only in select
[41:13.200 --> 41:18.240]  globalist industrial zones they allowed them to have the coal plants you give
[41:18.240 --> 41:22.920]  Latin America and Africa power plants which the UN's trying to block they
[41:22.920 --> 41:25.840]  openly say Obama's been over there trying to block power plants they're
[41:25.840 --> 41:30.480]  trying to block private companies going power plants within 30 years Africans
[41:30.480 --> 41:34.680]  will have only two children or less Latin Americans will they'll be wealthy
[41:34.680 --> 41:39.040]  see the globalist don't want that see once you become middle-class you stop
[41:39.040 --> 41:44.000]  having all the kids they don't want to fix the problem they want more chaos how
[41:44.000 --> 41:49.560]  sick is that do you hear the black lives matter people when you got 40 million
[41:49.560 --> 41:54.520]  people starving to death a year now up over 10 million the last few years you're
[41:54.520 --> 41:57.840]  talking about that you're talking about how it's discriminatory that under the
[41:57.840 --> 42:05.440]  UN treaty on climate change there were almost double the taxes on the third
[42:05.440 --> 42:10.160]  world carbon taxes there were on us but they sold it as if it was going to be
[42:10.160 --> 42:15.120]  wealth redistribution just like Obamacare was supposed to be that it's a big
[42:15.120 --> 42:21.200]  screw job for the poor so they're gonna have the Pope and everybody else there
[42:21.200 --> 42:28.720]  in Bloomberg and all the usual suspects Felipe Calderon
[42:28.720 --> 42:38.480]  Wow Lord Moncton is actually being allowed to speak hard they were
[42:38.480 --> 42:41.720]  threatening him earlier click on that he's actually listed by the UN wow I
[42:41.720 --> 42:44.320]  didn't even know that
[42:47.800 --> 42:52.000]  Wow we got to get Moncton immediately
[42:52.000 --> 43:01.720]  yeah they are we parachuted in oh wow anyways this is epic times to be alive
[43:01.720 --> 43:08.640]  now let's continue two children's center workers fired for refusing to
[43:08.640 --> 43:14.760]  acknowledge transgender girl age six these are the headlines that's in the
[43:14.760 --> 43:21.240]  mirror PC and sanity turns University of Missouri into police state they sent out
[43:21.240 --> 43:24.800]  emails and told everyone on campus if you hear anything hateful and or hurtful
[43:24.800 --> 43:29.720]  speech if it hurts you it hurts your feelings call the police me zoo
[43:29.720 --> 43:36.560]  protesters mazu protesters segregate by race white students has to leave black
[43:36.560 --> 43:40.880]  only healing space the focus groups were intended to create a black only
[43:40.880 --> 43:46.760]  healing space white allies told do not attend and this was public spaces again
[43:46.760 --> 43:53.560]  being taken over inside the university just total mindlessness if a college
[43:53.560 --> 43:59.360]  student stage walkout call for president's removal again over phantom
[43:59.360 --> 44:03.920]  racism by not acknowledging that everyone's oppressed and there's a class
[44:03.920 --> 44:09.160]  struggle this is just the White House bullying all the universities that
[44:09.160 --> 44:12.120]  aren't groveling enough just like the police departments doesn't mean these
[44:12.120 --> 44:15.080]  universities aren't terrible in many cases doesn't mean the police don't have
[44:15.080 --> 44:19.880]  big problems absolutely do but the whole thing's engineered as a takeover
[44:19.880 --> 44:25.400]  update race activists who got University of Missouri professor to resign does not
[44:25.400 --> 44:32.560]  attend school lives in Houston the award-winning super liberal professor
[44:32.560 --> 44:39.680]  Dale Brangham resigned because he said I'm not gonna give in you know to the you
[44:39.680 --> 44:44.200]  know hysteria and all the rest of it and I'm not gonna give into the campus
[44:44.200 --> 44:46.800]  being shut down over the fear of the clan we just stand up against you know
[44:46.800 --> 44:52.800]  the clan whether they're coming or not and not given to bullies so he said
[44:52.800 --> 44:55.120]  we're gonna still have the test you don't do it today but if you want to come
[44:55.120 --> 44:58.000]  in and have the bullies we're gonna have it for those want to have today they
[44:58.000 --> 45:03.520]  basically call for his firing he said you know what I resigned groveling basically
[45:03.520 --> 45:07.760]  groveling but saying the right thing hey stand up to bullies but there were no
[45:07.760 --> 45:13.600]  bullies that matter gone fourth grader threatened with sexual harassment for
[45:13.600 --> 45:16.880]  writing a love letter man I tell you all the other boys were saying girls were
[45:16.880 --> 45:20.040]  gross I was writing them love letters
[45:23.240 --> 45:27.280]  psychologists kids need to be educated about boundaries that's right teaching
[45:27.280 --> 45:30.600]  them remember what Seinfeld's daughter so they said we're back to New York from
[45:30.600 --> 45:33.880]  the small town so you can meet more boys and she said that's sexist boys and
[45:33.880 --> 45:39.560]  girls together is sexist see the biology of the species is evil a species that
[45:39.560 --> 45:46.040]  it's at war with itself total mental illness women seeing themselves as women
[45:46.040 --> 45:50.320]  men seeing themselves as men not as one species competing with each other that
[45:50.320 --> 45:58.240]  the that that's that's total destruction of the species that's just some of the
[45:58.240 --> 46:03.720]  news on the politically correct front and it just goes on and on and on and on
[46:03.720 --> 46:13.160]  and on and on and on from there meanwhile the real discrimination is the fact
[46:13.160 --> 46:18.120]  that if you just drink 1.3 parts per million which was the old level of
[46:18.120 --> 46:21.240]  fluoridation until we got a change two years ago to half that admitting it was
[46:21.240 --> 46:24.280]  brain damaging people just devastating victory the admission devastating
[46:24.280 --> 46:29.680]  victory still not completely out proven right again oh your total coax every
[46:29.680 --> 46:34.000]  scientist agrees is great for you now they should say take it out oh your total
[46:34.000 --> 46:39.400]  coax everyone agrees man made global warming is real it's all just a total
[46:39.400 --> 46:42.480]  fraud everyone agrees vaccines have no side effects and are perfect for you
[46:42.480 --> 46:47.080]  total lies the insert say they can kill you and everything else you can imagine
[46:47.080 --> 46:51.760]  I mean you name it you want diabetes type 2 you want Guillain berets you want
[46:51.760 --> 46:57.640]  narcolepsy you want epilepsy you want autoimmune diseases baby take the shots
[46:57.640 --> 47:02.360]  and they just answer and say we're total cooks ha ha ha ha there's no war on
[47:02.360 --> 47:06.160]  Christmas there's no war on Christians ha ha ha ha do you hear the crazy right
[47:06.160 --> 47:10.120]  wingers ha ha ha ha everything this info calling us right wingers everything
[47:10.120 --> 47:17.560]  just twisting language around where it means nothing anymore apple boss next
[47:17.560 --> 47:21.880]  generation of children will not know what money is and you don't want to be
[47:21.880 --> 47:27.720]  apple boss next generation of children will not know what money is and you know
[47:27.720 --> 47:32.800]  what that means once you don't physically hold it they can track they can trace
[47:32.800 --> 47:36.160]  they can tax they can control everything you do and they say they're going to do
[47:36.160 --> 47:42.320]  that won't be even the next generation it's here now oh guess we were right
[47:42.320 --> 47:47.080]  about that again media graveyard yeah kids won't know what newspapers are
[47:47.080 --> 47:51.840]  either daily newspapers down nearly 80% hard news in danger credibility will
[47:51.840 --> 47:56.360]  be undermined well it isn't just the digital age that did this newspapers and
[47:56.360 --> 47:59.120]  magazines that are still hard hitting an investigative work are doing better than
[47:59.120 --> 48:04.400]  ever you killed yourselves taking regurgitated and politically correct
[48:04.400 --> 48:14.040]  garbage news and made yourselves obsolete when I caught on record in 2000 the
[48:14.040 --> 48:19.880]  head of the statewide federally funded anti-gun control group is video this
[48:19.880 --> 48:27.000]  made national news paying three black men and it was like a movie like the
[48:27.000 --> 48:35.880]  guy was like a villain going 100 200 300 into their hands and I just turned the
[48:35.880 --> 48:39.880]  camera on run over they had a state ethics board and met that it could
[48:39.880 --> 48:44.800]  constitute bribery all stuff and the statesman calls me up and says if those
[48:44.800 --> 48:47.720]  men were white would you have shown the video on I said of course I would have
[48:47.720 --> 48:52.840]  it's it's it's you know state ethics board admits it you know is is totally
[48:52.840 --> 48:55.640]  discrediting a shot down a bunch of bills by the way devastating victory against
[48:55.640 --> 49:00.080]  the enemy we went in the citizens hundreds of us I just showed up I wasn't
[49:00.080 --> 49:03.800]  James Bond but I was and so were the women that rounds me and said hey they're
[49:03.800 --> 49:08.840]  paying them off over there see because it isn't like you got to be a super hero
[49:08.840 --> 49:15.840]  folks you got to show up and take action at the moral authority and I sat there
[49:15.840 --> 49:21.560]  talking to the reporter who had a point out everything's racially based now he
[49:21.560 --> 49:25.560]  had a spanish surname pull the article up it actually says the article I asked
[49:25.560 --> 49:28.840]  Jones this was racially motivated I said man that's really a way to turn that
[49:28.840 --> 49:32.480]  around you've been taught those tactics you know the people that testified
[49:32.480 --> 49:36.960]  basically I'm a dangerous black guy and I used to rob people and I want guns
[49:36.960 --> 49:40.520]  that's why you need to ban them those guys were there to make black people look
[49:40.520 --> 49:48.440]  bad and to play a stereotype as actors it turned out in a fraud to play the
[49:48.440 --> 49:55.440]  part of the dangerous evil black people quote to sell gun control so in truth I
[49:55.440 --> 50:00.480]  was exposing institutional racism literally and so they had to invert it
[50:00.480 --> 50:04.360]  but you know what we blew your bills up and they all failed that whole committee
[50:04.360 --> 50:09.480]  had like six bills set to pass had the votes we blew it up and that wasn't the
[50:09.480 --> 50:14.080]  end of the fight it was just one more victory and that's why I'm so aggressive
[50:14.080 --> 50:19.800]  folks I have blown the enemy to pieces thousands of times locally state level
[50:19.800 --> 50:23.680]  federal international and I'm gonna go on destroying them I'm gonna go on just
[50:23.680 --> 50:27.480]  sabotaging them on the truth blasting them to pieces ripping their systems
[50:27.480 --> 50:32.400]  to shreds sabotaging everything they do and you can do it too but I want you to
[50:32.400 --> 50:37.240]  join the fight against the globalist I want you to realize the war is on you
[50:37.240 --> 50:41.320]  don't have a choice you got to join this fight folks you got to get involved you
[50:41.320 --> 50:45.040]  got to get aggressive and people are desperate for the truth right now I

[01:00:24.760 --> 01:00:29.200]  against him he's been successful fighting it meanwhile African nations are
[01:00:29.200 --> 01:00:33.000]  refusing to take back the migrants that come over oh they're not loving they're
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.600]  hateful they're racist not taking back their own people Sweden says Syrian
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:41.600]  migrant brutally rapes woman while spitting in her face victim suffer shock
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:46.240]  double rape near refugee center Swedish King considers opening up royal
[01:00:46.240 --> 01:00:50.360]  palaces to house refugees and of course the royal palaces are really just
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:56.960]  government buildings of Sweden that's better than national service they want
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:01:02.200]  to have in Germany to quote have the college students quote service all the
[01:01:02.200 --> 01:01:08.240]  quote migrants the the weaponized flood population Syria threatens to target
[01:01:08.240 --> 01:01:11.800]  French aircraft carrier that's launching fighter bombers bombing its
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:17.200]  refineries and water treatment plants and roads that they're not bombing the
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:21.960]  Iraq area held by ISIS where they actually get oil money no they're they're
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:26.360]  on record even we have links to the articles on record they're bombing the
[01:01:26.360 --> 01:01:30.280]  Syrian infrastructure of the country which is a Geneva Convention violation
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:35.400]  obviously and the French are really something else you know I don't buy into
[01:01:35.400 --> 01:01:41.080]  this whole mindless frog phobia I'm not an angle of file either even though I'm
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:46.600]  obviously Welsh part Welsh I do have some French roots French German on one
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:52.920]  south family al-sation but the French you know were some of the toughest in war
[01:01:52.920 --> 01:01:58.320]  you're through Napoleon took over much of the world they beat the Germans with
[01:01:58.320 --> 01:02:03.040]  the US and others in World War one tens of millions died and then World War two
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:05.640]  they got bought out behind the scenes and stood down so Hitler could take over
[01:02:05.640 --> 01:02:08.640]  that was all payoff of the Vici French look it up it's a great parallel to what
[01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:13.480]  we've done or globalism minus the little fake Blitzkrieg mock invasion in the
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:20.080]  Dunkirk fiasco with Herman Göring's Luftwaffe standing down but when you look
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:27.640]  at this the French really do only get involved in evil stuff now I mean their
[01:02:27.640 --> 01:02:32.920]  government's really bad and all over Africa they've been caught putting jihadis
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:37.440]  in and then coming in and taking over and they've been really spearheading to a
[01:02:37.440 --> 01:02:43.880]  great extent the attack on Libya on Syria on other areas and it's just
[01:02:43.880 --> 01:02:50.520]  despicable I mean the French helped found this country we owe a debt to the
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:55.480]  French they have a great culture but they've just have mentally ill
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:03:00.800]  socialist running things there and they are just doing so many bad evil things
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:04.000]  because I mean the French are anti-war on average I don't call them wimps because
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.560]  they don't want to get in a bunch of wars that's smart and all the stupid you
[01:03:08.560 --> 01:03:12.680]  know French fries stuff you call them freedom fries you know whatever Iraq war
[01:03:12.680 --> 01:03:17.800]  was wrong I don't Trump was right about that so was I but now man I tell you I
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:25.640]  do want to call them freedom fries because just to watch France bomb civilian
[01:03:25.640 --> 01:03:32.520]  infrastructure and to know the socialist party that runs its tax exempt and has
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:36.280]  Swiss bank accounts and they have a hundred and one percent tax for three
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:41.000]  years running on the middle class and wealthy who aren't exempt people don't
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000]  believe me when I say there's a hundred and one percent tax people making over
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:48.600]  a million euros a year the tax bracket under that two hundred thousand euros a
[01:03:48.600 --> 01:03:53.320]  year something like what is it eighty something percent you know what's a
[01:03:53.320 --> 01:03:56.560]  hundred and one percent tax for that's meant to destroy any wealth it didn't
[01:03:56.560 --> 01:04:01.800]  control by the mob I say mob I don't mean Italians see how they program
[01:04:01.800 --> 01:04:06.160]  everything where words don't mean anything anymore I mean the European
[01:04:06.160 --> 01:04:13.160]  criminal mob France has the highest suicide rate in the world last time I
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:19.120]  checked now surpassing Japan and it's because they don't have a purpose and
[01:04:19.120 --> 01:04:24.480]  they're all entitled it's not just spoiled rotten welfare heads or whoever
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:28.560]  that are entitled folks it's the people of the West period who've had it so good
[01:04:28.560 --> 01:04:36.880]  so long that it's just the unraveling and degeneration of everything and it is
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:43.960]  that great paradox that I quote so often from the great French philosopher
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:04:51.200]  Victor Hugo that adversity makes men prosperity makes monsters the problem
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:56.840]  is freedom creates prosperity and then it creates monsters so how do you balance
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:05:05.080]  that Marco Rubio the new billionaire boy toy was left speechless on the fourth
[01:05:05.080 --> 01:05:09.440]  GOP debate when Rand Paul called him on his absurd pandering to the military
[01:05:09.440 --> 01:05:13.800]  industrial complex and his attempt to outdo Hillary Clinton with free college
[01:05:13.800 --> 01:05:17.840]  and yes I do want to rebuild the American military rebuild the American
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:22.280]  military seriously Rubio but you know we spend more on our military than the
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:25.920]  next 10 countries combined I know that Rand is a committed isolationist for
[01:05:25.920 --> 01:05:29.400]  Marco's perspective if you don't have more than the seven Obama wars going
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:33.960]  here are an isolationist perhaps would be safer if we were involved in 10 wars or
[01:05:33.960 --> 01:05:38.560]  maybe even better picked a fight with Russia so Rubio's masters could cash in
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:43.880]  Marco how is it conservative how is it conservative to add a trillion dollar
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:47.680]  expenditure for the federal government there's nothing for how is it
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:52.160]  very ran how is it conservative to add a trillion dollars in military
[01:05:52.160 --> 01:05:55.460]  expenditures you cannot be a conservative if you're gonna keep
[01:05:55.460 --> 01:05:59.680]  promoting new programs that you're not gonna pay for when cells become toxic
[01:05:59.680 --> 01:06:04.600]  they die early and aging sets in no one has put together a formula that focuses

[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.320]  Asians in one group of the Japanese another group I mean this is true
[01:09:16.320 --> 01:09:19.560]  Balkanization the opposite of Martin Luther King it's scary but it's social
[01:09:19.560 --> 01:09:25.920]  control total hijacking of great classical liberal ideas he's been talking
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:29.520]  about this for years and he is a recipient of the Rockefeller Foundation
[01:09:29.520 --> 01:09:32.840]  research fellowship so he's worked inside the belly of the beast before we do
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:38.160]  that I wanted to play a couple clips we haven't gotten to that that are context
[01:09:38.160 --> 01:09:51.160]  for this the Buckley program and Yale had this particular professor on who
[01:09:51.160 --> 01:09:54.440]  wrote the coddling of the American mind again even the liberal Atlantic is
[01:09:54.440 --> 01:09:59.720]  admitting the stuff's going on and then the protests begin protesting well
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:05.120]  first amendment lawyer and the fire president CEO Greg and I'm pronouncing
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:10.400]  this right Lucanoff how do you say that Lucanoff author of the coddling of
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:14.400]  American mind speaks during the state of the free expression intellectual
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:17.960]  diversity in higher education fifth annual conference and this is the thing
[01:10:17.960 --> 01:10:24.120]  I have a really good friend who was a big Hollywood editor I went to college
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:27.680]  same time as him I was in a student film and I mean he edited some of the big
[01:10:27.680 --> 01:10:30.600]  Hollywood films he just didn't like Hollywood didn't like it want to go
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:36.720]  back to school and get a psychology degree I guess he's going for his PhD or
[01:10:36.720 --> 01:10:42.000]  whatever right now and it's literally a cult where he's got to identify and say
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:47.320]  that he's bad because he's white and just bizarre weirdness where if he makes
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:50.520]  one mistake his whole paper is given a zero everybody else can make all the
[01:10:50.520 --> 01:10:56.840]  mistakes they're giving a pluses I mean it's crazy it's crazy but it's also just
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:11:01.240]  men in general and it's men leading women saying men are bad and men have to
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:06.680]  not denounce they're basically bad I mean it's just gangs it's gang mentality
[01:11:06.680 --> 01:11:11.720]  it's raw exercise of like brown shirt stuff in Germany that's all this is
[01:11:11.720 --> 01:11:15.560]  devolved into any group can degenerate right wing left wing you name it and
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:19.560]  this is people basically going getting these university degrees that are more
[01:11:19.560 --> 01:11:24.320]  and more close to useless in some cases because the economy and they're just
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:29.920]  looking for identity and it's devolving into king rat behavior it's devolving
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:32.920]  into prison behavior everybody's in their own little group and then the ward
[01:11:32.920 --> 01:11:36.280]  manages all that this has been done by social engineers on record and our
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.720]  our gas room was put through these programs that's why he's an insider
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:43.560]  exposing it you understand again as I said a thousand times this is not
[01:11:43.560 --> 01:11:48.880]  rhetoric when I say these things that this is CIA Defense Department Ford
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:54.360]  Foundation Rockefeller Foundation on record doing this where people's
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:57.560]  identities aren't I'm being discriminated against by the NSA spying on me
[01:11:57.560 --> 01:12:02.160]  or Samsung TVs watching me admitted or being signed on to trillions and
[01:12:02.160 --> 01:12:06.760]  derivatives that aren't my debt or GMO not being able to be labeled or being
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:09.680]  told I've got to let the globalists bring in cheap labor and pay for it all as
[01:12:09.680 --> 01:12:16.600]  a you know free welfare free baby stuff as a corporate welfare pay off to give
[01:12:16.600 --> 01:12:22.280]  them the labor on and on and on all the real issues all the real things
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:27.760]  happening it is a tyranny so we're gonna our guest after I play this clip you
[01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:33.920]  know Seinfeld's come out and says his daughter 13 years old I think she's a
[01:12:33.920 --> 01:12:42.680]  13 to 14 says dad dad you know why we move back to New York well because when
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:47.000]  you have more friends and meet more boys she says dad boys and girls together a
[01:12:47.000 --> 01:12:51.920]  sexist just to say boys and girls and see Seinfeld thought that she just
[01:12:51.920 --> 01:12:57.320]  didn't understand no no no she understood this is what's taught I mean
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:02.240]  it's beyond 1984 it's beyond we and other dystopic novels this is the
[01:13:02.240 --> 01:13:06.960]  destruction of language and communication by design so let's go to this
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:10.680]  clip of where it's a first amendment summit and it's being shut down at Yale
[01:13:10.680 --> 01:13:16.280]  and now Yale is apologizing that they did have professors say we shouldn't ban
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:23.640]  Halloween parties let's go to the club here it is another time was one of when
[01:13:23.640 --> 01:13:27.000]  I covered the University of Delaware case and I went to actually University of
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:30.520]  Delaware to explain why their program was so nuts I can't explain the
[01:13:30.520 --> 01:13:34.560]  University of Delaware program in any fewer than 50,000 words so please read
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:38.960]  my book on learning liberty but it was insane and this is all you know so this
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:44.600]  is all 2007 and before I have never seen such an emotional display from
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:49.320]  from students and again this was over an email about hey can we chill out a
[01:13:49.320 --> 01:13:54.800]  little about a little bit about Halloween I'm sorry
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:03.360]  and they take over it's all about taking over and blocking speech we don't
[01:14:03.360 --> 01:14:07.840]  care how dare you say we should be able to have costume parties I mean this is
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:16.480]  total beyond Jim Jones coach totally proposed totally post aside okay so we
[01:14:16.480 --> 01:14:22.240]  stand our sisters of color so I watched this white kid this is like his fight
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:27.720]  to show he's battling his coming of age he's trying to stop free speech I'm
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:32.360]  telling you look how upset and weird that guy looks I've been around these
[01:14:32.360 --> 01:14:36.760]  people that guy looks like a cult member he looks like a zombie and I'm sorry I
[01:14:36.760 --> 01:14:38.880]  don't just go off looks but these people all have the same like where they
[01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:43.480]  can't walk they stumble around for making a mild criticism by the way I don't
[01:14:43.480 --> 01:14:46.320]  even charge that guy if you did that to cops anywhere else he'd be charged with
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:50.560]  resisting arrest this is amazing
[01:14:55.160 --> 01:15:00.520]  this is absolutely amazing yeah I just kept him in there when he was doing it
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:03.360]  it goes on it gets worse I don't have time to play I want to go to the
[01:15:03.360 --> 01:15:06.600]  professor I'm gonna skip this one break to give him more time I'll play the
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:11.520]  Seinfeld clip but you got to understand folks the people running this you
[01:15:11.520 --> 01:15:14.240]  notice at every university now it's basically the same this didn't just
[01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:18.120]  magically happen the Atlantic says how did it get this way why do they have
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:22.280]  panic attacks if you have a brown paper bag you know why do they see racism in
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:27.440]  the clouds it was scientifically done I'm gonna shut up and he's got a lot of
[01:15:27.440 --> 01:15:31.480]  points he wants to go over he's got an initiative he's gonna call for today you
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:37.400]  know Janet Napolitano heads up a bunch of universities how about she resides so
[01:15:37.400 --> 01:15:41.440]  we're talking about using their own weapons against them we have the
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:45.760]  White House praising the protest again this is about global social
[01:15:45.760 --> 01:15:50.080]  engineers taking everything over with one standardized culture that is a
[01:15:50.080 --> 01:15:53.880]  plastic corporate culture that can be rewritten within a week and then you're
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:56.760]  given the new received proper terms people last while they're always
[01:15:56.760 --> 01:16:00.760]  changing why it's always getting more extreme because it's scientific we're
[01:16:00.760 --> 01:16:05.480]  being culturally conquered not that the old mix of culture was perfect but at
[01:16:05.480 --> 01:16:09.560]  least it was cultures this is scientific I'm gonna shut up now and go to the
[01:16:09.560 --> 01:16:17.520]  professor trying day.com you can find his book and work there Darrell is taught
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:20.840]  at the University of California at Davis for most of his academic career he
[01:16:20.840 --> 01:16:23.600]  holds undergraduate and graduate degrees in political science popular
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:29.040]  culture studies and comparative culture on moto is the senior ranking professor
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:31.880]  of the Department of Asian American Studies he's a recognized authority on
[01:16:31.880 --> 01:16:35.680]  US media popular culture and sexuality having published extensively in these
[01:16:35.680 --> 01:16:39.600]  areas on moto is a recipient of the Rockefeller Foundation Research
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:44.640]  Fellowship at UCLA as a Fulbright scholar his current project is a volume
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:48.080]  that outlines the principles of the New World Order theory teaches a class on
[01:16:48.080 --> 01:16:52.440]  this and is directed to the current generation of college and under and
[01:16:52.440 --> 01:16:56.400]  university undergraduates in search of alternatives to the dominant Foundation
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:00.520]  guided corporate as curriculum now that said that's a mouthful but that's what
[01:17:00.520 --> 01:17:04.080]  this is and you've got me from the outside telling you what I see he can
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:06.920]  tell you from the inside good to have you back my friend I just played some of
[01:17:06.920 --> 01:17:11.840]  those clips is it cresting or is it just starting is this the beginning of the
[01:17:11.840 --> 01:17:17.400]  malice style red terror or the Soviet or Jack booted brown shirt Nazi
[01:17:17.400 --> 01:17:22.600]  bizarreness I mean this is crazy it's good to be back Alex good to be back
[01:17:22.600 --> 01:17:28.720]  with you in your audience you know my perceptions and yours square up almost
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:36.280]  identically and I refer to this process as weaponizing the student body there's
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:40.600]  a two-fold meaning in that one is that the students are being used as a tool or
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:46.520]  a weapon against discussion against dissent against dissenters against
[01:17:46.520 --> 01:17:51.440]  unpopular or actually I'm a very popular professor but they're used as a
[01:17:51.440 --> 01:17:56.120]  weapon against professors such as myself who don't go along with the
[01:17:56.120 --> 01:18:01.280]  politically correct orthodoxy and the second meaning of weaponization is that
[01:18:01.280 --> 01:18:08.480]  these creatures that we're seeing on these YouTube show postings their bodies
[01:18:08.480 --> 01:18:13.160]  have been weaponized you've talked many times about the sodium fluoride that's
[01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:18.080]  only part of it according to an environmental scientist scientists by
[01:18:18.080 --> 01:18:23.440]  the name of Lauren Moray these undergraduates are being hit with heavy
[01:18:23.440 --> 01:18:33.160]  concerted programmed doses of EMF they're being heavily controlled by social
[01:18:33.160 --> 01:18:38.160]  media in general you're right screen time on record reprograms and brain
[01:18:38.160 --> 01:18:45.560]  damages it does in addition to that we have been subjected to involuntarily
[01:18:45.560 --> 01:18:50.240]  we've been subjected to experiments such as this famous social contagion
[01:18:50.240 --> 01:18:55.000]  experiment that was launched by Facebook and their team of behavioral and
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:59.960]  social scientists wrote a paper on it a social science paper an academic paper
[01:18:59.960 --> 01:19:05.320]  and they were completely unapologetic about it so this is a total like you're
[01:19:05.320 --> 01:19:09.960]  saying it is a program it's the students are on a electro pharmaceutical
[01:19:09.960 --> 01:19:15.560]  gulag and it's no accident that whatever campus you go to it's the same program
[01:19:15.560 --> 01:19:20.800]  it's the same scenario you have these subsets of what you could call the crisis
[01:19:20.800 --> 01:19:26.400]  actor that we saw rolled out in Sandy Hook and now they've been deployed
[01:19:26.400 --> 01:19:32.400]  populations you've got the Soros connected railroad head who's got his son
[01:19:32.400 --> 01:19:36.600]  out there triggering and running the whole op exactly that the so they got
[01:19:36.600 --> 01:19:40.000]  just a few of their operatives they're then given media attention they're then
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:45.280]  the the victim and then they then lead the sheep to slaughter that's right these
[01:19:45.280 --> 01:19:49.920]  are Judas goats or the alpha goats and as you pointed out earlier there's a
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:55.120]  certain subset within that and they're typically aligned with some sort of GLB
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:20:00.760]  TQ IA agenda or they come out of gender and sexuality studies by the way they
[01:20:00.760 --> 01:20:04.120]  don't even call it women's studies anymore because part of this agenda is to
[01:20:04.120 --> 01:20:08.040]  take us into a post-gender world a transhumanist post-human world they're
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:11.560]  not freeing us sexually you're an expert on this they are ending our sexual
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:16.120]  power that's right they're gonna take us to the next level as it said and
[01:20:16.120 --> 01:20:21.600]  that's the level where there there is no gender differentiation so you see this
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:28.160]  woman Melissa click who thankfully resigned she's a crisis actor it's gonna
[01:20:28.160 --> 01:20:30.960]  be interesting to see if some one of your listeners want to track her to see
[01:20:30.960 --> 01:20:35.520]  where she shows up but I'm sure she has a job waiting for her someplace in the
[01:20:35.520 --> 01:20:43.400]  university system but it's typically a female quote-unquote white assistant
[01:20:43.400 --> 01:20:46.520]  professor this is what you said here two years ago I mean you've laid this out
[01:20:46.520 --> 01:20:52.040]  it's a program oh yes I've had a ringside seat in this Neil Maoist
[01:20:52.040 --> 01:20:57.960]  pull pot style red guards program that's being run out of the academic affairs
[01:20:57.960 --> 01:21:02.440]  and I want to point that by the way folks I just got chills yeah he's not just
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:04.880]  saying that he went through the Rockefeller program this is what they
[01:21:04.880 --> 01:21:10.360]  did with the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia and it's what they did in China I mean
[01:21:10.360 --> 01:21:14.040]  we're that's right it's crazy to see that our government would do this because
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:18.720]  you know what the next phases are and US intelligence was behind the auto
[01:21:18.720 --> 01:21:24.040]  genocide in Cambodia and by the way I teach the children and grandchildren of
[01:21:24.040 --> 01:21:29.160]  refugees from these totalitarian regimes and that's why they're somewhat
[01:21:29.160 --> 01:21:34.120]  resistant to the political correctness that they are being indoctrinated to it
[01:21:34.120 --> 01:21:38.080]  at the University of California University of Missouri I guess it kind of wakes you
[01:21:38.080 --> 01:21:42.800]  up to have your family killed it does so they're there at the tipping point so
[01:21:42.800 --> 01:21:46.920]  to speak they're trying to recruit them aggressively through these mind
[01:21:46.920 --> 01:21:50.760]  control regiments again through the Office of Student Affairs and so-called
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:57.280]  student community centers where they go to these little enclaves and reopen
[01:21:57.280 --> 01:22:02.160]  their their hurts their little problems with mommy and daddy and they take them
[01:22:02.160 --> 01:22:06.760]  to these isolated retreats and then they find people there who can take the
[01:22:06.760 --> 01:22:10.640]  program a little bit further and then if you're really really sleazy you get to
[01:22:10.640 --> 01:22:16.080]  stay behind to attend the after-party and then perhaps after that maybe you get
[01:22:16.080 --> 01:22:20.520]  to party with Janet La Palzano one of these mansion parties who knows that's
[01:22:20.520 --> 01:22:27.000]  it's a cult it's a cult it's a mind-control cult it's comes right
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:32.480]  out of the pages of Jonestown which again apparently was a US intelligence
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:36.240]  operation I got exposed they shut it down and everybody killed themselves
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:41.520]  absolutely and several people including Congressman Leo Ryan sacrificed their
[01:22:41.520 --> 01:22:47.480]  lives in order to expose this dark aspect of our national security University
[01:22:47.480 --> 01:22:51.000]  State well when we put this interview out and write articles about it tomorrow
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:54.840]  and it's it's again it's not rhetoric I say that neurotically because it's true
[01:22:54.840 --> 01:22:59.080]  University professor exposes government mind control programs on
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:03.840]  universities and that's what it is it's so bold that they would and please keep
[01:23:03.840 --> 01:23:06.800]  getting into the facts and the techniques of how they do it but it's
[01:23:06.800 --> 01:23:11.840]  really as bold they try this here and I guess it's working like a charm except
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:15.840]  you're fighting back and many others are now fighting back it may backfire on
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:20.760]  them please keep elaborating well any number of professors my colleagues even
[01:23:20.760 --> 01:23:25.320]  at UC Davis are beginning to man up on this issue sorry if we're using the
[01:23:25.320 --> 01:23:30.360]  second language I got in trouble for talking to a provost and using that no
[01:23:30.360 --> 01:23:34.280]  I understand we need to do that not because we're trying to just showing
[01:23:34.280 --> 01:23:37.800]  everything's program please continue I'm doing it as a deliberate provocative
[01:23:37.800 --> 01:23:43.480]  gesture just to antagonize these rats who are spying on me right now but yeah
[01:23:43.480 --> 01:23:48.520]  these well first of all let me establish I've done some research on the
[01:23:48.520 --> 01:23:53.400]  chancellor Linda Kate who by the way is deducting 25% of my salary for the next
[01:23:53.400 --> 01:23:58.480]  five months and I call here and now for her immediate resignation as chancellor
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:03.520]  the University of California Davis because she is engaged in actions that go
[01:24:03.520 --> 01:24:09.960]  counter to the Constitution the US Constitution to the very principles of
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:15.480]  academic freedom so Linda Kate he stand down and while you're at it please take
[01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:21.160]  the president of the UC system Janet Apolitano with you and Dean Susan
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:26.680]  Kaiser who has stationed a emeritus professor in my class is both of them
[01:24:26.680 --> 01:24:31.240]  he's attending every single one of my lectures and taking copious notes so that
[01:24:31.240 --> 01:24:36.560]  he can pass it to the commissars so why don't you three resign leave us alone
[01:24:36.560 --> 01:24:41.440]  we're going to rebuild the University of California without you the people of the
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:46.640]  state of California the American people will prevail on this issue and by the
[01:24:46.640 --> 01:24:50.680]  way I've read about you in in in student writings other things you've got some of
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:53.760]  the most attended classes you head up the department they tried to get rid of
[01:24:53.760 --> 01:24:57.720]  you you're promoting true classical liberalism and the young men and women
[01:24:57.720 --> 01:25:01.040]  love it because I'm not putting words your mouth they explain to people how
[01:25:01.040 --> 01:25:05.440]  successful you've been because you're your toto pulling back the curtain
[01:25:05.440 --> 01:25:09.360]  showing the man behind the curtain or the women behind the curtain that are
[01:25:09.360 --> 01:25:15.440]  literally engaged in in in cultural mind control because they know these these
[01:25:15.440 --> 01:25:18.680]  young people aren't gonna be able to get jobs now in this economy they got to
[01:25:18.680 --> 01:25:22.480]  screw them up mentally so they're adult and in a cult and don't know why they
[01:25:22.480 --> 01:25:26.400]  have no future so I mean this is really a sabotage of the American mind in a
[01:25:26.400 --> 01:25:30.960]  vulcanization but specifically talk about I mean how popular you are that's
[01:25:30.960 --> 01:25:34.520]  why they're trying to get rid of you well in all modesty I was teaching
[01:25:34.520 --> 01:25:40.880]  introductory classes of 200 students and my classes were routinely oversubscribed
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:46.600]  and the university is so sleazy they put one of these controllers into the
[01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:51.240]  departmental chair of my department and he hired somebody specifically and then
[01:25:51.240 --> 01:25:57.880]  she hired four student snitches assistants to empty out my classes and she
[01:25:57.880 --> 01:26:02.720]  went on social media Twitter Facebook in order to do so now eventually she got
[01:26:02.720 --> 01:26:05.600]  thrown under the bus and that's a warning to all you snitches out there we
[01:26:05.600 --> 01:26:09.320]  think you're going to get over by screwing with people whether it's me
[01:26:09.320 --> 01:26:13.520]  or someone else but eventually they're going to roll over on you so keep that
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:19.760]  in mind before you attend one of these bogus encampments these so-called safe
[01:26:19.760 --> 01:26:24.400]  spaces or before you turn your soul over to so-called the student community
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:30.680]  center but she got rolled over and as a result to this new academic year I'm
[01:26:30.680 --> 01:26:36.280]  Mr. Popular again my my classes are already from the next quarter already
[01:26:36.280 --> 01:26:43.040]  are oversubscribed unless they pull some dirty tricks on me so yes I was I am the
[01:26:43.040 --> 01:26:48.120]  senior ranking professor definitely scared of you and that's the point is
[01:26:48.120 --> 01:26:51.840]  you've been through several years of persecution for teaching a class really
[01:26:51.840 --> 01:26:56.120]  giving young people true value on how the education system has been taken over
[01:26:56.120 --> 01:27:00.800]  this is invaluable that's right and and they understand it Alex these are
[01:27:00.800 --> 01:27:06.120]  really super bright highly motivated young men and women and that is why I
[01:27:06.120 --> 01:27:10.840]  am so thoroughly invested in their future because their features are future
[01:27:10.840 --> 01:27:15.320]  and I am not submitting to this notion that America the American economy is
[01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:21.760]  dead or dying in fact aren't my new area of emphasis is building up the new
[01:27:21.760 --> 01:27:26.320]  Silk Road economy as it's called well I agree with you we could turn the economy
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:30.080]  back on any time they're trying to go into this post industrial shutdown mode
[01:27:30.080 --> 01:27:33.840]  trying to get them ready for it that's why doing what you're doing will help
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:36.600]  create a new Renaissance and more and more professors are doing it let's get
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:39.600]  more into the technicals though because you've been to the Rockefeller program I
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:44.360]  mean this is a real operation how do they take these young people and get them
[01:27:44.360 --> 01:27:49.120]  where they're just hysterical in fear like Freddy Krueger is coming to get
[01:27:49.120 --> 01:27:53.840]  them when they hear there might be you know you're not banning the the the
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:58.600]  people from wearing costumes and then they shriek and scream and I mean act
[01:27:58.600 --> 01:28:02.480]  like someone just murdered their baby this is true mind control when you look
[01:28:02.480 --> 01:28:07.320]  at these people they're wild-eyed they're scared I mean what have they done to
[01:28:07.320 --> 01:28:13.760]  these people well first of all they have to hire a ethnically correct leader a
[01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:17.440]  vice chancellor they had the student affairs unit and that covers everything
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:22.200]  from athletics to food service to the so-called student community center and
[01:28:22.200 --> 01:28:26.680]  she and I say she because it's typically a woman these days has to be a minority
[01:28:26.680 --> 01:28:32.360]  Latina or Asian American or African American so she's there she's in place
[01:28:32.360 --> 01:28:38.320]  and then she staffs the entire operation with people who are sympathetic to the
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:41.000]  agenda and the agenda by the way it comes from the Pentagon it comes to the
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.200]  Department of Defense it doesn't come from the University of California it
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:47.640]  definitely doesn't come from the professors and we have a principle of
[01:28:47.640 --> 01:28:53.080]  governance which has completely been discarded so they have that and at the
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:57.720]  ground level they have at the student community center we have a brand new
[01:28:57.720 --> 01:29:02.960]  building on our campus here at UC Davis and what they did is they threw all the
[01:29:02.960 --> 01:29:07.660]  student to the true student activists out of it out of the operation and they
[01:29:07.660 --> 01:29:13.120]  put these people who are maybe in their late 20s early 30s who always wanted to
[01:29:13.120 --> 01:29:18.080]  be popular when they were undergraduates apparatus aparatics correct and they
[01:29:18.080 --> 01:29:24.320]  have a master's degree it's just just a you know graduate degree to to administer
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:32.640]  the 18 and 19 year olds who are looking for legitimately a social cause they
[01:29:32.640 --> 01:29:37.160]  want a better society they roll model them they put them in you know you just
[01:29:37.160 --> 01:29:39.600]  like if you want to corrupt an 18 year old woman to make her a prostitute put
[01:29:39.600 --> 01:29:42.640]  her in with a you know 20 year old who guides her into it they just get them
[01:29:42.640 --> 01:29:46.360]  ready to pimp them directly and stay there this is inside Intel folks key

[01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:32.960]  by the way the University of Missouri Fox News is now reporting has appointed a
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:37.880]  new black interim president and I could care less if you got a black football
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:42.000]  coach or black president as long as they do a good job but this is clearly you
[01:33:42.000 --> 01:33:48.200]  must resign admit your racist and we're giving your job cuz you're white I mean
[01:33:48.200 --> 01:33:54.600]  it's terrorism and it just shows what they can do and this is again federally
[01:33:54.600 --> 01:33:58.640]  globalist directed where they can make the universities all capitulate do
[01:33:58.640 --> 01:34:03.240]  whatever they want because after they remove 20 or 30 university presidents
[01:34:03.240 --> 01:34:08.360]  and chancellors they're gonna say now you will adopt 100% our program you will
[01:34:08.360 --> 01:34:12.800]  now carry it out report you a Missouri names black interim president you
[01:34:12.800 --> 01:34:16.680]  yesterday the governing board University of Missouri has selected a black law
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:20.800]  professor and deputy chancellor emeritus to serve as interim president of the
[01:34:20.800 --> 01:34:25.080]  university system multiple media outlets were reporting Thursday it'll only get
[01:34:25.080 --> 01:34:30.600]  worse now because it just it never stops Michael Middleton retired in August
[01:34:30.600 --> 01:34:37.320]  over 30 years at the school his selection comes three days after Tim Wolf
[01:34:37.320 --> 01:34:41.160]  resigned have been controversy over his handling of a series of racially charged
[01:34:41.160 --> 01:34:45.480]  events and they're now calling it Yale a racially charged event because people
[01:34:45.480 --> 01:34:54.720]  freaked out and said banned costume parties I mean it's just crazy but it's
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:34:57.560]  not when you realize it's weaponized it's by design professor Darrell
[01:34:57.560 --> 01:35:04.000]  homomoto is our guest and he heads up the he's the senior ranking professor in
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:07.440]  the Department of Asian American Studies he's began to see this years ago and
[01:35:07.440 --> 01:35:10.480]  has now been writing about it and exposing it extensively before we go
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:18.000]  back to him ladies and gentlemen we cannot fund this operation without your
[01:35:18.000 --> 01:35:21.200]  support and you've been doing that so you've seen us expand hire more
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:25.760]  reporters send our reporters around the country in the world break more news
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:30.800]  have a bigger effect but I believe in the free market I know you're such great
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:34.440]  listeners that you'd buy products even they weren't the very best but I want
[01:35:34.440 --> 01:35:37.560]  you to be a repeat customer plus I want the good you know karma whatever you
[01:35:37.560 --> 01:35:43.480]  want to call it we bring you really true game changers I could have a hundred
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:48.080]  products out right now go to a major manufacturer they still be pretty decent
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:52.640]  private label an entire line for one of these big manufacturers and have a hundred
[01:35:52.640 --> 01:35:58.360]  products out in just a few months and make more money but I refuse to do that
[01:35:58.360 --> 01:36:02.920]  we go out and absolutely every product is what I call a game changer every
[01:36:02.920 --> 01:36:07.600]  product is like top scientists doctors researchers saying this is the missing
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:11.360]  link this is this is what people aren't getting sometimes real simple like truly

[01:36:17.040 --> 01:36:20.920]  nascent iodine x2 because we've tested some of stuff out there it's not really

[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:29.360]  intestines with higher level oxygen the time releases whether it is the liver

[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:49.600]  million more than that can be toxic according to our experts still consult
[01:36:49.600 --> 01:37:00.280]  your doctors topical internal whatever you take silver bullet it is the best
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:03.760]  quality we could come out with and is lower than leading competitors so there's
[01:37:03.760 --> 01:37:07.560]  exact same stuff from the same manufacturers some of our stuff is
[01:37:07.560 --> 01:37:10.440]  private label a lot of it's originally produced but but with big
[01:37:10.440 --> 01:37:14.360]  manufacturers so that's what it comes down to we've got a whole bunch of
[01:37:14.360 --> 01:37:18.840]  products we've got up to like 15 products in the last three years we've got a few
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:22.280]  more coming online the next few months but I plan to kind of round stuff out
[01:37:22.280 --> 01:37:26.560]  with about 30 products because I'm not going to try to come out with like 500
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:31.000]  great products which takes 15 20 years to do that's what young Jevities done I
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.760]  support them they got a great line of products in force health.com you want to
[01:37:34.760 --> 01:37:40.480]  find beyond Tangierine 2.0 and pollen burst other great products as well just
[01:37:40.480 --> 01:37:45.400]  amazing that supports the broadcast to in force health.com in force team.com if

[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:11.120]  encourage everybody to take advantage of that we still have big specials on some
[01:38:11.120 --> 01:38:16.360]  of the other nutraceuticals upwards of 25% off on things like winter sun high

[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:26.040]  on the water filtration systems like Alexa Pure Pro and the 10% off of promo
[01:38:26.040 --> 01:38:30.840]  code water that's infowarstore.com in a sub area as infowarslife.com
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:37.520]  or call toll free 888-2533139 and one way you can still vote is with your
[01:38:37.520 --> 01:38:41.200]  dollars and with your support that's why it's important to support professors
[01:38:41.200 --> 01:38:45.480]  like professor Daryl Homamoto who's been threatened to be fired had his pay cut
[01:38:45.480 --> 01:38:49.000]  being harassed to tell the truth but I can tell he's more alive than ever
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:52.800]  because that's really the sustenance of why I was telling the truth but when you
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:56.680]  do spread the word about free speech when you support true classical liberals
[01:38:56.680 --> 01:39:01.880]  libertarianism whatever you want to call it when we take back the real mantle of
[01:39:01.880 --> 01:39:06.600]  renaissance and enlightenment and culture away from these tyrant control
[01:39:06.600 --> 01:39:11.680]  freaks and their minions we begin to turn the tide against this new dark age
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:15.440]  the system wants to bring in now I'm done ranting I apologize I've been
[01:39:15.440 --> 01:39:19.120]  ranting I'll go back to professor Homamoto here at trindade.com you want
[01:39:19.120 --> 01:39:24.720]  to find his publications professor you got cut off getting into how they
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:29.400]  technician things how they break it down how they stable the young people how
[01:39:29.400 --> 01:39:33.960]  they run them through how they peer pressure them and just young people I
[01:39:33.960 --> 01:39:38.040]  mean it's like even my kids you know they're in there in school 13 11 and
[01:39:38.040 --> 01:39:43.880]  7 other kids learn how to be mean and then my kids sometimes want to be mean
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:48.480]  back I try to teach you it doesn't matter you'll transcend this you know live
[01:39:48.480 --> 01:39:53.080]  your own life find the few people you like get along with them it's the same
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:55.880]  peer pressure cult and they kind of keep that going into college into the
[01:39:55.880 --> 01:39:59.160]  workforce everywhere else but I've learned if you tell children but also
[01:39:59.160 --> 01:40:02.280]  young adults about this like you're doing this is how you're being programmed
[01:40:02.280 --> 01:40:05.720]  this is how you're being socially meant to feel bad if you don't submit to this
[01:40:05.720 --> 01:40:10.960]  and then you feel accepted tribalism what you naturally need cultural by
[01:40:10.960 --> 01:40:14.840]  submitting to this you this is a fake culture you need to find true culture
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:19.600]  with real people and free association that does transcend race religion region
[01:40:19.600 --> 01:40:25.520]  you know ethnicity all this stuff true free market of ideas so I'm done ranting
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:28.280]  get into how the technicians operate you've got the floor pretty much the
[01:40:28.280 --> 01:40:32.600]  rest of the hour I want you to break it down major whistleblower from UC Davis
[01:40:32.600 --> 01:40:36.360]  head of the Asian-American studies persecuted for years telling the truth
[01:40:36.360 --> 01:40:40.640]  I want you to get back into how they do it but also I'd like to ask you
[01:40:40.640 --> 01:40:44.000]  somewhere in there how did you begin to wake up was it when they put you to the
[01:40:44.000 --> 01:40:49.280]  Rockefeller program or or were you always somewhat awake and then where do
[01:40:49.280 --> 01:40:56.080]  you see this going go ahead well answer your last question first I was even as a
[01:40:56.080 --> 01:41:01.200]  young person and by the way they start tracking you in elementary school there's
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:05.680]  a reason why a certain group of kids are always taking these little standardized
[01:41:05.680 --> 01:41:11.520]  tests reading mathematics very early on today the so-called stem program
[01:41:11.520 --> 01:41:15.840]  identifies students in elementary school and that's one of the reason why
[01:41:15.840 --> 01:41:21.440]  Jerry Seinfeld's daughter came back with that can to response about moving back
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:26.000]  to New York because it's a program and a lot of these students who are trained
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.760]  at UC Davis and other places at this so-called student community center do
[01:41:30.760 --> 01:41:36.080]  what's called outreach that's that's a red flag word right there outreach to the
[01:41:36.080 --> 01:41:39.760]  elementary schools and to the junior high schools and high schools so by the
[01:41:39.760 --> 01:41:43.560]  time they come to the university they've already been primed and they've been
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:48.400]  pre-selected so far as the leadership track is concerned now within that there's
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:54.440]  a pincer movement between two student constituencies that are being used and
[01:41:54.440 --> 01:41:59.360]  you can tell by the amount of resources that are being allocated to these areas
[01:41:59.360 --> 01:42:04.040]  and you can also tell by the identification for example Linda Kotehi the
[01:42:04.040 --> 01:42:08.720]  chancellor at UC Davis she's an engineer by training and by the way she holds
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:14.720]  19 patents for antennas and antennas are key to this whole EMF regime that's
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:20.040]  part of the mind control system but she's has declared herself as part of the
[01:42:20.040 --> 01:42:25.800]  gender and sexuality studies even though she has no academic expertise in the
[01:42:25.800 --> 01:42:34.080]  area so that's a big area it's it's the GLBT QIA department and programs that
[01:42:34.080 --> 01:42:38.160]  the so-called student activists are being recruited from and those are the
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:42.840]  people that come into my class most recently in a sexuality class that's
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:47.920]  sitting the back and you showed a video earlier and they start questioning you
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:53.360]  aggressively they try to sweat you they'll wear little fright wigs little
[01:42:53.360 --> 01:42:58.120]  purple wigs and just all of a sudden spontaneously as if they were mind
[01:42:58.120 --> 01:43:01.720]  controlled which they are and they'll start spontaneously asking you these
[01:43:01.720 --> 01:43:08.320]  questions all you have to do is break them down individually and and they
[01:43:08.320 --> 01:43:13.160]  begin to crumble another technique I've known is said yeah come up to the to the
[01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:17.200]  stage to the front of the stage here's an open microphone tell me what what you
[01:43:17.200 --> 01:43:21.600]  want to see in this class and they have nothing they have nothing by the way
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:25.360]  this is a technique that a lot of comedians stand up people like
[01:43:25.360 --> 01:43:29.920]  Seinfeld will use I'll just turn the light on the heckler and they don't have
[01:43:29.920 --> 01:43:34.400]  anything they're just they're there they have a program so getting back on point
[01:43:34.400 --> 01:43:39.680]  we have the the GLBT Q mafia that's out there and the other mafia is the
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:44.840]  children of illegal immigrants and supposedly underrepresented minorities
[01:43:44.840 --> 01:43:50.160]  on campus at UC Davis there is an office in the so-called student community
[01:43:50.160 --> 01:43:55.800]  center called AB 540 that stands for California Assembly Bill 540 the so-
[01:43:55.800 --> 01:44:01.240]  called a dream act which hasn't even passed yet it's not close to passing but
[01:44:01.240 --> 01:44:07.360]  the University of California has taken upon itself probably from orders from
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:12.400]  the Pentagon a DoD or the Wall Street the city of London bankers on orders from
[01:44:12.400 --> 01:44:17.440]  them to establish a center to normalize their presence not just in the
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:22.240]  University but in society it's not that they care about the children of
[01:44:22.240 --> 01:44:26.640]  illegal immigrants and I have nothing against them personally they're
[01:44:26.640 --> 01:44:31.360]  they're wonderful individuals the students I know many of them but they're
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:36.480]  going to be used as tools in the future out of gratitude they're going to be the
[01:44:36.480 --> 01:44:42.160]  people who are in CPS the social workers the psychotherapists the teachers the
[01:44:42.160 --> 01:44:47.880]  people who are helping to bring in this larger globalist sure the Soviet Union
[01:44:47.880 --> 01:44:50.440]  always uses to mean interrupt was it so true what you're saying I just got to
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:54.640]  back you up the Soviet Union the Nazis all totalitarians use quote orphans
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:45:00.080]  within a ten-year training program are then the shock troops they are the
[01:45:00.080 --> 01:45:06.280]  union absolutely and you were mentioning that there's a ethnically correct
[01:45:06.280 --> 01:45:11.480]  interim president appointed to the University of Missouri I call that
[01:45:11.480 --> 01:45:16.560]  process whereby administrators and certain faculty including assistant
[01:45:16.560 --> 01:45:21.160]  professors who need need to show that they're quote-unquote down with the
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:27.640]  students in order to get tenure I call that flak mail as in flak catchers and
[01:45:27.640 --> 01:45:33.480]  this comes from Tom Wolf this is the common strategy if you read a classic
[01:45:33.480 --> 01:45:39.920]  essay by Tom Wolf called my mowing the flak catchers 1970 he talks about how
[01:45:39.920 --> 01:45:45.600]  the so-called liberals with a small L got behind the original Black Panthers
[01:45:45.600 --> 01:45:49.680]  and got into this what he calls radical chic and that's one of the reasons why
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:53.560]  you're not hearing a lot of professionals come forward at this
[01:45:53.560 --> 01:45:57.640]  point I think they're they're they're starting to but not in large numbers
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:01.520]  because they're still going at they're still operating on the basis of what
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:06.120]  was going on through the 60s and 70s they don't realize that this is a really
[01:46:06.120 --> 01:46:13.840]  serious Maoist Paul pot type takeover using the Jung and as a means is a tool
[01:46:13.840 --> 01:46:19.240]  for the totalitarian takeover and the Paul pot time I have their children as
[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:24.720]  I mentioned the refugees in my classes it's it's difficult selling them but if
[01:46:24.720 --> 01:46:29.240]  they can get them into the so-called student community center take them
[01:46:29.240 --> 01:46:34.280]  they can take them to these retreats so-called and by the way the other red
[01:46:34.280 --> 01:46:39.920]  flag-letter word is leadership leadership retreats they take them into a
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:45.320]  remote location to University of California owned or leased property they
[01:46:45.320 --> 01:46:50.600]  isolate them they play these little trust games the trainers with the master's
[01:46:50.600 --> 01:46:56.320]  degrees and PhD level psychotherapists are there to oversee it they are all
[01:46:56.320 --> 01:47:00.880]  trained in neuro linguistic programming the Delphi technique all these
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:04.240]  different mind control protocols that come out of the Stanford research
[01:47:04.240 --> 01:47:09.280]  institute research institute the random corporation completely weaponized
[01:47:09.280 --> 01:47:15.360]  behavioral science directed against 18 19-year-old first-year students who are
[01:47:15.360 --> 01:47:20.080]  away from home they're ripe for cult membership and indoctrination induction
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:24.800]  along with the various cults that line up by the coffee remember under the
[01:47:24.800 --> 01:47:28.480]  60s earlier template that sounded reasonable don't tell your kids what
[01:47:28.480 --> 01:47:33.360]  to do let them be their own don't be their parents they're now looking for
[01:47:33.360 --> 01:47:37.560]  parents like young gang members you know looking for a father figure and joining
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:41.680]  the the Crips or whatever they're now looking for mommy and daddy and they're
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:47.360]  given it this is so systematic that's absolutely correct and the court that I'm
[01:47:47.360 --> 01:47:51.320]  talking about their their parents typically have their head screwed on
[01:47:51.320 --> 01:47:56.080]  straight their immigrants they came to the United States to make a living to
[01:47:56.080 --> 01:48:01.080]  live in freedom and liberty so it's really really difficult and also they're
[01:48:01.080 --> 01:48:07.080]  their family oriented the Latinos Latinos they come from the society and culture
[01:48:07.080 --> 01:48:10.920]  that's wonderful the parent culture so when they come to the University of
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:15.600]  California they have to unlearn all that so they are indoctrinated by this
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:21.320]  weaponized behavioral science I agree it works better on fourth fifth sixth
[01:48:21.320 --> 01:48:25.560]  seventh generation whites I found are the absolute worst and then blacks feel
[01:48:25.560 --> 01:48:28.720]  like they've got a you know been wrong which they were but that that chip is
[01:48:28.720 --> 01:48:32.360]  reinstated and then projected on to everybody I mean am I accurate saying
[01:48:32.360 --> 01:48:35.680]  from your perspective that whites and blacks are the easiest to get into the
[01:48:35.680 --> 01:48:39.280]  brainwashing or is that wrong that is correct and I would add to that fourth
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:43.480]  and fifth generation Asian Americans and fourth and fifth generation Latinos and
[01:48:43.480 --> 01:48:48.520]  Latinas it's a generational drift away from the vitality of the parent culture
[01:48:48.520 --> 01:48:54.240]  and so that's why it's so important to start reteaching instead of doing this
[01:48:54.240 --> 01:48:58.120]  quote-unquote theory in the English Department of History let's read the
[01:48:58.120 --> 01:49:03.360]  the Nordic tales the medieval literature the the great works of art
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:09.520]  literature music so that we can get this new renaissance into gear here and
[01:49:09.520 --> 01:49:13.240]  that's where we're heading this is where we're heading despite the little petty
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:16.280]  time right let's talk about your main mission I mean I mean because that's
[01:49:16.280 --> 01:49:19.760]  really this I mean you you you have a solution and I've read it your essays
[01:49:19.760 --> 01:49:23.480]  your work I mean you know because you're an insider how to beat them and and the
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:26.240]  new Renaissance is here we give them the opportunity that there's a real
[01:49:26.240 --> 01:49:31.560]  Renaissance and it's about them it's game over that's right first of all I'm
[01:49:31.560 --> 01:49:35.720]  getting my students to start reading nothing they don't have to read
[01:49:35.720 --> 01:49:42.760]  Dubliners or Ulysses by James Joyce which was purposely made difficult to
[01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:47.160]  understand so that you create jobs for professors of literature but even
[01:49:47.160 --> 01:49:53.440]  popular literature like Michael Creighton I mean before he was well let's
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:58.560]  say he died okay before he expired he was really really getting into the heart
[01:49:58.560 --> 01:50:04.200]  of this bio weaponization system with his novel next and a state of fear where
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:08.120]  he took apart the whole fake environmental scare and he even had a
[01:50:08.120 --> 01:50:11.880]  bibliography in the back of his book and an author's statement now this is a man
[01:50:11.880 --> 01:50:16.120]  who has a medical degree from Harvard Medical School and he's a hugely
[01:50:16.120 --> 01:50:21.400]  popular writer so I get to say please we're coming up to Thanksgiving and the
[01:50:21.400 --> 01:50:27.040]  winter holidays you know read a novel and even if it has to be JK rolling the
[01:50:27.040 --> 01:50:30.800]  Satanist you read it with a certain eye if you want to read Tolkien that's fine
[01:50:30.800 --> 01:50:37.040]  if you're a ringer fine but understand the the occultic and the social and
[01:50:37.040 --> 01:50:42.040]  cultural engineering and the Tavistock connections to to these forms of a mass
[01:50:42.040 --> 01:50:45.120]  mind control by the way one thing I found common to a lot of the current
[01:50:45.120 --> 01:50:49.080]  generation of students and this is true not just with Americans but I also taught
[01:50:49.080 --> 01:50:54.120]  of course this summer for full writers and so these are the best and brightest
[01:50:54.120 --> 01:50:59.880]  of young people from all over the world there's one common literary source that
[01:50:59.880 --> 01:51:05.880]  they all share and this is something that that needs to be looked into by people
[01:51:05.880 --> 01:51:10.120]  in the English department or comparative literature they've all read Harry Potter
[01:51:10.120 --> 01:51:16.400]  all the volumes these were the kids that stood in line until midnight waiting for
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:20.320]  the next volume to drop they've all read it systematically so there's
[01:51:20.320 --> 01:51:23.480]  something there this could be like the catcher in the rye of the current
[01:51:23.480 --> 01:51:28.240]  millennial generation it might be one of those Mark David Chapman trigger type
[01:51:28.240 --> 01:51:33.760]  deals but and by the way everything you say is so backed up in fact I just want
[01:51:33.760 --> 01:51:38.080]  to talk about Dr. Nick baggage whose of course brother was a US senator his
[01:51:38.080 --> 01:51:43.560]  father congressman he's detailed thousands of patents but hundreds of them
[01:51:43.560 --> 01:51:49.040]  and DARPA and antennas and I even read articles in the Baltimore Sun on air
[01:51:49.040 --> 01:51:54.400]  where DARPA said you know at the local universities we're testing systems with
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:58.760]  wavelengths to soothe the students so when you bring that up I don't know how
[01:51:58.760 --> 01:52:03.760]  much you can go into it sounds crazy but we're in 2015 he says don't worry about
[01:52:03.760 --> 01:52:07.680]  the fluoride in the water that's bad enough that yes they are in selective
[01:52:07.680 --> 01:52:13.800]  areas testing and we know that's patented for decades a literal wavelengths with
[01:52:13.800 --> 01:52:18.880]  frequency pollution and then I look at the students that come out and protest us
[01:52:18.880 --> 01:52:23.080]  the Maoists they have tattoos a Mao on them black white you name it when I look
[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:28.600]  at the the student that was attacking the professor you know they're at Yale at
[01:52:28.600 --> 01:52:33.720]  the free speech summit they can't walk they're kind of falling down they
[01:52:33.720 --> 01:52:37.560]  look crazy their eyes don't point the right directions and I don't go off a
[01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:42.240]  book's cover but when I went out to this pro-life demonstration and literal
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:46.880]  people showed up black white you name it all looked the same spiritually wise
[01:52:46.880 --> 01:52:50.440]  they were like the white people almost had like green skin they were all
[01:52:50.440 --> 01:52:55.480]  wearing black they would stumble into me and like oh and but they all pulled up
[01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:58.920]  like in you know brand-new black jaguars and stuff talk about the activist
[01:52:58.920 --> 01:53:02.840]  chic and then we went and tracked them as we got a tip they're like at the police
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:08.000]  review boards with the UT professors literally setting up like a communist
[01:53:08.000 --> 01:53:12.880]  takeover and admitting it I mean it's just like that's who the elite are gonna
[01:53:12.880 --> 01:53:17.480]  put in charge is like weirdos stumbling around saying they love Satan that can
[01:53:17.480 --> 01:53:22.080]  hardly walk I mean there's something going on like is it spiritual is it
[01:53:22.080 --> 01:53:26.240]  chemicals what are they doing to these I mean we know about MK ultra and the
[01:53:26.240 --> 01:53:31.800]  unabomber you know at Harvard or whatever it was with the CIA MK ultra
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:36.280]  programming he was in that folks that's that's L.A. Times I'm kind of ranting
[01:53:36.280 --> 01:53:41.080]  here it's just I'm noticing something that they're like zombies have you seen
[01:53:41.080 --> 01:53:46.160]  that absolutely their EMF zombies as I told you before Chancellor Linda
[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:52.760]  Catae has 19 unique patents on a Tana antenna technology to her name but it's
[01:53:52.760 --> 01:53:56.520]  not an accident that she was put in this position because the University of
[01:53:56.520 --> 01:54:01.480]  California Davis also has a close connection an intimate connection with
[01:54:01.480 --> 01:54:07.480]  the Los Alamos nuclear labs and the Lawrence Livermore Edward Teller thought
[01:54:07.480 --> 01:54:12.920]  UC Davis was one of his favorite campuses so UC Davis is and it also has a
[01:54:12.920 --> 01:54:17.520]  national primate laboratory where they workshop all these different EMG and
[01:54:17.520 --> 01:54:21.880]  different types of EMF I was led into the UT facility while I want to get
[01:54:21.880 --> 01:54:25.480]  arrested I wasn't led into it I was I was allowed to see a camera into it from
[01:54:25.480 --> 01:54:29.240]  the psychology department hell on earth but you notice none of the liberals
[01:54:29.240 --> 01:54:34.920]  want to stop that you know there's no discussion about that no yeah welcome to
[01:54:34.920 --> 01:54:38.840]  the monkey house and it's interesting that you brought up Dr. Nick Begich I
[01:54:38.840 --> 01:54:45.400]  was going to speak to some of the really early on discoveries or insights that
[01:54:45.400 --> 01:54:49.360]  Dr. Begich had and that was his his work on the harp what we're seeing here with
[01:54:49.360 --> 01:54:54.520]  students on campus that crazed look that Maoist commie look that you have seen in
[01:54:54.520 --> 01:54:59.720]  people both on tape and in person that comes from EMF this is harp this is
[01:54:59.720 --> 01:55:04.600]  harp in action so ladies and gentlemen now if you think this is the harp pro
[01:55:04.600 --> 01:55:10.240]  project there's just for our enemies foreign it's really for the people the
[01:55:10.240 --> 01:55:14.200]  American people and they're hitting our young people the most we know about the
[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:17.320]  psychotropic so I was going to mention Dr. Peter Bragan's great work on
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:23.160]  psychotropic drugs we know that a large percentage percentage if not most of the
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:28.240]  young men and women are on some form of very powerful hallucinogenic drugs they
[01:55:28.240 --> 01:55:31.720]  should be taking nutraceuticals vitamin supplements and they also should be
[01:55:31.720 --> 01:55:37.080]  taking mandatory gym classes that's one of my suggestions that we need to bring
[01:55:37.080 --> 01:55:41.520]  back PE of K through 12 through middle and high school and also through the
[01:55:41.520 --> 01:55:45.480]  college and university so people can start getting they have no social skills
[01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:48.960]  to I mean are you seeing that that's right you need to learn how to be true
[01:55:48.960 --> 01:55:55.720]  team players not not Maoist pull pot type of zombie players wow and so yeah
[01:55:55.720 --> 01:56:00.240]  that's it's definitely harp I think that's something that needs to be looked
[01:56:00.240 --> 01:56:06.960]  at much more closely last academic year a portable very very powerful antenna
[01:56:06.960 --> 01:56:11.440]  portable antenna showed up and people were talking about then it kind of went
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:15.840]  away but they're experimenting with it they're putting in new lighting systems
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:20.520]  supposedly smart lighting systems you name it by the way though that's even in
[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:25.360]  USA today that it can be used to transmit data back and forth but also to
[01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:31.080]  calm the police officers in Minnesota where they put it in first and they just
[01:56:31.080 --> 01:56:35.760]  put out like a lot you know like it's like Rasmussen poll national polls should
[01:56:35.760 --> 01:56:41.200]  we arrest global warming skeptics it's just kind of oh the lights calm the
[01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:45.640]  police officers I mean we're not making this up it sounds fantastical but it's
[01:56:45.640 --> 01:56:49.200]  all really going on I mean I remember five years ago six years ago exposing
[01:56:49.200 --> 01:56:52.200]  stingray systems and they wouldn't admit they were there now everybody's like oh
[01:56:52.200 --> 01:56:56.560]  of course there's secret cell towers grabbing everything I mean it's just I'm
[01:56:56.560 --> 01:57:00.560]  telling you it is a fantastical time to be alive as scary as it is professor isn't
[01:57:00.560 --> 01:57:05.160]  it exciting that we are conscious wonder trying to figure this out I mean it's an
[01:57:05.160 --> 01:57:11.920]  adventure it is an adventure I am so glad happy honored to be here in 2015
[01:57:11.920 --> 01:57:16.960]  joining in this battle with you and the people Liberty loving people in America
[01:57:16.960 --> 01:57:22.000]  and around the world to take back our civilization and we are going to win
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:27.120]  because all I have to do is talk to the gangstalkers individually and they melt
[01:57:27.120 --> 01:57:32.440]  they break down the programming just disappears it's not that strong because
[01:57:32.440 --> 01:57:36.520]  you've got humanity and it's electrical exactly they know I'm real they know I'm
[01:57:36.520 --> 01:57:41.560]  sincere they don't they know I don't have an axe to grind or a hidden agenda if
[01:57:41.560 --> 01:57:46.520]  I did I would you know be on Wall Street or something but when you tell the
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:50.240]  truth the eloquent way you do and expose it and give the sources they've been
[01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:53.920]  looking for the truth they're already subconsciously smart that you're not
[01:57:53.920 --> 01:57:56.800]  teaching anything you're just telling them what they already knew but was
[01:57:56.800 --> 01:57:59.920]  blinded you're just taking you're just opening the curtains and the lights
[01:57:59.920 --> 01:58:04.560]  coming in and that's why we are gonna win is because humanity wants to succeed
[01:58:04.560 --> 01:58:10.400]  together to the stars it's gonna happen we've just got to really work hard to
[01:58:10.400 --> 01:58:14.680]  try to make this transition period not as destructive as these wicked elites
[01:58:14.680 --> 01:58:17.520]  would rather it be I'm gonna go to break keep over five minutes I'll be
[01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:20.720]  probably got to go to finish up talk about some of your papers how we keep
[01:58:20.720 --> 01:58:24.320]  you at the university how we get what you're teaching in associate programs
[01:58:24.320 --> 01:58:27.960]  maybe to other universities I know there are a lot of other professors around the
[01:58:27.960 --> 01:58:32.360]  country of every race color creed religion that are also basically saying
[01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:36.240]  the same thing you're saying this is explosive it's dangerous to the elite
[01:58:36.240 --> 01:58:46.920]  we'll be right back this is GCN the Genesis communications radio network

[02:00:06.520 --> 02:00:13.880]  media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[02:00:13.880 --> 02:00:28.440]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones by the way
[02:00:28.440 --> 02:00:33.320]  I wasn't really told not to say this it's always best not to talk about really
[02:00:33.320 --> 02:00:37.120]  interesting contacts until you can just try to land them as a guest but usually
[02:00:37.120 --> 02:00:40.240]  people don't want to come on as guests I've talked about how basically top
[02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:45.560]  generals current former media people you name it about 95% of the time they
[02:00:45.560 --> 02:00:50.560]  don't want to be talked about on air but people need to know how many people are
[02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:55.840]  aware of what's going on and tuned into what's happening and last night I got a
[02:00:55.840 --> 02:01:01.440]  phone call by who I've got to say is one of the coolest Hollywood actors there
[02:01:01.440 --> 02:01:06.480]  is and of course I didn't answer the phone I was driving and I called back and
[02:01:06.480 --> 02:01:11.760]  they read an event and then I talked back and forth via text but I'm gonna try to
[02:01:11.760 --> 02:01:17.280]  work it on getting on the show I'll just say this give us some money about ski I
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:21.640]  mean you just cannot beat how many great people are waking up to what's
[02:01:21.640 --> 02:01:25.640]  happening and they're classical liberals folks and it's scaring the
[02:01:25.640 --> 02:01:29.000]  establishment to death I mean most people in the CIA don't want to destroy
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:33.040]  the country most people you know most cops don't want to move it no matter
[02:01:33.040 --> 02:01:37.080]  what color you are or bureaucrats or farm workers or whatever and once the
[02:01:37.080 --> 02:01:40.800]  cosmology of reality because we're not telling you what to believe we've
[02:01:40.800 --> 02:01:45.480]  studied the documents once this whole real universe breaks open and people get
[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:50.040]  out of the control bubble it's over all we're doing is pulling the curtain back
[02:01:50.040 --> 02:01:56.320]  and it's exponential the awakening happening my concern only got three
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:59.800]  minutes left final word a professor is that they're gonna start a war with
[02:01:59.800 --> 02:02:02.840]  Russia they're gonna do something with China the globalists don't want to give
[02:02:02.840 --> 02:02:07.600]  up and they need some cataclysm to keep us in line I think they're building all
[02:02:07.600 --> 02:02:11.080]  this mind control towards some cataclysm which they didn't think we'll
[02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:13.880]  all submit under the next level I mean I just think we're at a critical
[02:02:13.880 --> 02:02:18.640]  crossroads right now well that's why it's so important to get the information
[02:02:18.640 --> 02:02:23.360]  and the analytical framework out ahead of this so that when a cat a stage
[02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:27.800]  cataclysm does appear that the American people and the people of the world will
[02:02:27.800 --> 02:02:32.800]  not panic and they will not submit to fear and go along with the totalitarian
[02:02:32.800 --> 02:02:37.480]  system that they'll try to impose on us the police state once they put this
[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:43.560]  stage crisis into motion so what you're doing is is so vitally important as a
[02:02:43.560 --> 02:02:48.760]  bulwark against together we are what about these installed chips on the
[02:02:48.760 --> 02:02:51.880]  shoulder because I don't say this because you're a Japanese-American but you know
[02:02:51.880 --> 02:02:55.920]  millions or hundreds of thousands of Japanese multi-generation loyal people
[02:02:55.920 --> 02:03:01.040]  thrown in slave labor didn't have chips on their shoulders afterwards per capita
[02:03:01.040 --> 02:03:03.760]  some of the most successful people out there it's not that they weren't wrong
[02:03:03.760 --> 02:03:07.160]  it's just they weren't gonna let that keep them back but it is a cautionary
[02:03:07.160 --> 02:03:11.260]  tale of what can happen again in this country oh it is it's happens it's
[02:03:11.260 --> 02:03:15.600]  happened in our society in our country in our nation before it's half we've
[02:03:15.600 --> 02:03:20.840]  seen it happen in other countries as well don't think that it can't happen
[02:03:20.840 --> 02:03:26.480]  here America for all its bedrock values of freedom liberty is vulnerable as any
[02:03:26.480 --> 02:03:30.960]  other society especially when you're bringing in large groups of people
[02:03:30.960 --> 02:03:35.560]  from societies that are used to multi-generational oppression totalitarian
[02:03:35.560 --> 02:03:42.760]  dictatorships and LAA systems of control and that's part of the reason why the
[02:03:42.760 --> 02:03:50.040]  handlers are doing this the AB 540 group over at the student affairs so what I'm
[02:03:50.040 --> 02:03:53.640]  suggesting is that we take the monies that are being funneled into student
[02:03:53.640 --> 02:03:58.000]  affairs and then reallocate them into foundational courses higher assistant
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:01.360]  professors like Melissa click one of the reasons why they are doing this is
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:05.880]  because they want to get a tenured job so they the only way they can do it is to
[02:04:05.880 --> 02:04:09.960]  mama the administration and to give them giving them a job so let's create
[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:14.080]  positions for assistant professors let's get back into the humanities
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:21.640]  curriculum literature film new media religion philosophy music studio on the
[02:04:21.640 --> 02:04:25.440]  shoulder and how to be an agree not to be a free human right it's it's the it's
[02:04:25.440 --> 02:04:30.320]  the mantra race class gender race class gender race class gender whatever class
[02:04:30.320 --> 02:04:36.000]  you take that is all you hear ladies and gentlemen that's that's over that's 30

[02:05:13.720 --> 02:05:17.760]  and yes I do want to rebuild the American military rebuild the American
[02:05:17.760 --> 02:05:22.200]  military seriously Rubio but you know we spend more on our military than the

[02:05:25.840 --> 02:05:29.320]  Marco's perspective if you don't have more than the seven Obama wars going
[02:05:29.320 --> 02:05:33.880]  you're an isolationist perhaps would be safer if we were involved in 10 wars or
[02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:38.480]  maybe even better picked a fight with Russia so Rubio's masters could cash in

[02:08:23.200 --> 02:08:30.000]  Clinton top insider handler when he was governor and of course part of the
[02:08:30.000 --> 02:08:34.000]  Clinton Chronicles and so much more exposing what's happening Larry says
[02:08:34.000 --> 02:08:38.000]  he knows what Republicans will do to Alistar Carson and Trump which will
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:44.280]  leave the race still in Bush's lap and he predicted that they wouldn't get her
[02:08:44.280 --> 02:08:47.800]  on the emails and that so far has happened but now they're talking about a
[02:08:47.800 --> 02:08:51.320]  serious criminal investigation with the FBI Larry believes Hillary is now
[02:08:51.320 --> 02:08:57.920]  shaping the field on the Republican side and will throw it to Bush and then
[02:08:57.920 --> 02:09:01.680]  he says he's gonna stop Hillary we're gonna ask him how but Bill Clinton was
[02:09:01.680 --> 02:09:04.160]  quoted wasn't the New York Times saying who are you scared of and he said Larry
[02:09:04.160 --> 02:09:08.680]  Nichols so it's always interesting to have Larry Nichols on with us before I
[02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:11.720]  go any further though because this has been ready for a week and I haven't aired
[02:09:11.720 --> 02:09:14.840]  it about four or five minutes long we'll come back to Larry Nichols I've got
[02:09:14.840 --> 02:09:20.360]  all this other news to cover as well first off I told you there's a globalist
[02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:26.160]  takeover run by the big foundations of local government local police and state
[02:09:26.160 --> 02:09:29.800]  and local universities it doesn't mean the cops are perfect doesn't mean the
[02:09:29.800 --> 02:09:33.680]  universities are great the point is it's a globalist takeover and they're
[02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:38.040]  manipulating everyone and that's what all these little staged events around the
[02:09:38.040 --> 02:09:42.200]  country they're just a test for the next big wave and the professor we just had
[02:09:42.200 --> 02:09:46.880]  on was Rockefeller trained at the Rockefeller Foundation he just turned
[02:09:46.880 --> 02:09:51.040]  against him he was taught all this stuff that's how he knows that was huge
[02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:55.400]  whistleblower we just had on Larry Nichols was there at the Democratic
[02:09:55.400 --> 02:09:58.360]  Party when they were talking about the broken coalition strategy a
[02:09:58.360 --> 02:10:02.680]  balkanizing assault to control us so none of us can organize to defeat the
[02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:07.560]  New World Order basically so he can tell you from one inside perspective so can
[02:10:07.560 --> 02:10:11.600]  the other professor that's what this is all about is getting people to see the
[02:10:11.600 --> 02:10:15.320]  game people go well I know it's a game but I still am angry I want to fight
[02:10:15.320 --> 02:10:18.520]  within it well then you're a chump you're no better than a bull running at a
[02:10:18.520 --> 02:10:22.720]  red cape and the Matador sticks a sword in your heart don't be stupid the
[02:10:22.720 --> 02:10:30.200]  Matador is the issue not the red cape you are not a stupid bull are you and
[02:10:30.200 --> 02:10:33.120]  look I know our general audience knows all this better than I I'm just saying
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:37.880]  we got to get the word out to people and we're having an effect but it's so
[02:10:37.880 --> 02:10:43.880]  over-the-top now will the Yale head have to step down after allowing Halloween
[02:10:43.880 --> 02:10:48.480]  parties I mean when will the government start arresting climate deniers
[02:10:48.480 --> 02:10:53.800]  Rasmussen poll I mean this is all really happening they're actually floating
[02:10:53.800 --> 02:10:57.600]  it's time to start arresting people hi we're gonna arrest you now for your
[02:10:57.600 --> 02:11:05.800]  political view we're liberal by the way it's serious but this is this is a lot
[02:11:05.800 --> 02:11:09.920]  better video if you're actually watching a radio you can watch the free feeds
[02:11:09.920 --> 02:11:15.960]  info wars.com forward slash radio I've lost I've gone from 280 pounds down like
[02:11:15.960 --> 02:11:19.400]  230 something and the biggest supercharger of it all because I'm
[02:11:19.400 --> 02:11:23.360]  exercise less than I did just a couple years ago I could swim two miles go jogging
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:26.320]  still not lose weight but once we're doing supermail vitality survival shield
[02:11:26.320 --> 02:11:32.480]  next to you know gut flushes with the liver shield the rest of it it's just I
[02:11:32.480 --> 02:11:38.560]  keep losing weight it's amazing people can see it right now and it's been a
[02:11:38.560 --> 02:11:44.920]  long journey doing it but info wars life.com well my good buddy from high
[02:11:44.920 --> 02:11:50.360]  school Shane Steiner had the idea let's go out and shoot some video of us barefoot
[02:11:50.360 --> 02:11:54.440]  skiing and I said Shane I can barely ski and I can barely you know wakeboard you
[02:11:54.440 --> 02:11:58.080]  know your your nephews the world champion you know your your dad's world
[02:11:58.080 --> 02:12:01.520]  champion bull rider your brother's a world champion steer roper you're built
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:05.440]  like Conan the barbarian naturally I said I'm not gonna go you know Anthony
[02:12:05.440 --> 02:12:10.160]  Gucciardi went so even though he wiped out big time on Lake Austin it's like a
[02:12:10.160 --> 02:12:14.440]  month ago we shot this we said and put it out yet we're not making fun of Anthony
[02:12:14.440 --> 02:12:19.240]  at the end of the video he had the wave o's to get in the arena and do it but
[02:12:19.240 --> 02:12:22.600]  this is Shane you'll see Shane two years ago getting on supermail and that's what
[02:12:22.600 --> 02:12:26.920]  he did supermail doing the same stuff and now he trains with like the number
[02:12:26.920 --> 02:12:30.640]  two middleweight in the UFC you name it he's never had the motivation to do all
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:34.560]  the stuff and his dad's like yeah he never wanted to do the you know the
[02:12:34.560 --> 02:12:38.360]  wakeboarding the wake surfing without a rope he never wanted to do back flips
[02:12:38.360 --> 02:12:42.560]  like him as his dad and his brother do and it just gave him the motivation and
[02:12:42.560 --> 02:12:46.360]  now he's probably a better athlete than his brother and his dad his dad's like
[02:12:46.360 --> 02:12:50.600]  60 something looks like he's you know Iron Man champion or something this is
[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:54.440]  the genetics these guys are just they've got as it's Shane you had something
[02:12:54.440 --> 02:12:58.240]  supermail vitality in the mix it's incredible so they wanted to endorse it
[02:12:58.240 --> 02:13:01.280]  they wanted to talk about it because they're all addicted to it I'm gonna go
[02:13:01.280 --> 02:13:08.680]  to Larry Nichols but here is the video of the wake surfing wakeboarding barefoot
[02:13:08.680 --> 02:13:33.640]  skiing you name it here it is
[02:13:33.640 --> 02:13:46.720]  doing with his teeth right there that's what happens when you guys lose weight
[02:13:46.720 --> 02:13:51.040]  get healthier but somebody like those genetics okay so two years ago I found
[02:13:51.040 --> 02:13:57.560]  myself on the couch completely out of shape overweight I had no muscle tone
[02:13:57.560 --> 02:14:02.600]  and I just felt horrible and I knew I needed to make a change I needed to
[02:14:02.600 --> 02:14:06.480]  start going to the gym and working out and I did that I I would force myself to
[02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:10.160]  go to the gym and it was really wasn't going very well that's when my my buddy
[02:14:10.160 --> 02:14:16.000]  Alex told me to try the supermail vitality and that's what changed
[02:14:16.000 --> 02:14:19.880]  everything for me change diners involvement with info wars life.com
[02:14:19.880 --> 02:14:23.720]  truly happened in an organic way I went to high school with Shane his brother
[02:14:23.720 --> 02:14:27.200]  knew his parents well and he was visiting the office once hadn't been to the
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:30.840]  office in years and said wow I noticed you're making and selling supplements to
[02:14:30.840 --> 02:14:34.440]  these really work because I've tried a lot of supplements as a workout
[02:14:34.440 --> 02:14:37.760]  enthusiast and I really think most of them are high I said here take some home
[02:14:37.760 --> 02:14:42.560]  try it well a few weeks later he came in blown away and said I want to buy three
[02:14:42.560 --> 02:14:47.160]  boxes of this stuff to get my friends and family it's simply amazing he said why
[02:14:47.160 --> 02:14:50.640]  does it work so well and I said listen go to info wars life.com watch the
[02:14:50.640 --> 02:14:54.240]  informational videos with Dr. Group and others they understand how it all works
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:14:58.960]  I know that it works for me that's all I understand the science the facts the
[02:14:58.960 --> 02:15:03.200]  research people's testimonials they're all in info wars life.com you can check it
[02:15:03.200 --> 02:15:08.240]  out for yourself I wanted to go to the gym I wanted to push myself and work out
[02:15:08.240 --> 02:15:12.480]  harder and that led to me being able to come out and do stuff like the bare
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:16.400]  footing and the surfing and stuff like that which I would never done I never
[02:15:16.400 --> 02:15:21.000]  would have done that two years ago Shane has said over and over again more than
[02:15:21.000 --> 02:15:25.440]  just libido and energy it made him want to get into the gym more it made him
[02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:29.080]  want to get in better shape and believe me the Steiner's have amazing genetics
[02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:33.920]  his brother is a world champion steer wrestler his dad Bobby Steiner is a
[02:15:33.920 --> 02:15:39.320]  famous world champion bull rider they've got natural genetics but when you
[02:15:39.320 --> 02:15:45.320]  added this to the mix in Shane's own words it took him to the next level
[02:15:47.920 --> 02:15:51.720]  Bobby just absolutely loves it he wanted to endorse it so that's why he's in this
[02:15:51.720 --> 02:16:02.080]  their idea. I give him cases of it now though. Shane noticed the mental clarity
[02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:06.960]  Bobby was able to work out longer and gain muscle mass he's already completely
[02:16:06.960 --> 02:16:10.880]  shredded I gotta admit for me the biggest effect has been libido now I've
[02:16:10.880 --> 02:16:14.480]  never claimed to have a body like some beach model but back when I was 20 22
[02:16:14.480 --> 02:16:17.720]  years old and worked out every day I looked great but over the years and
[02:16:17.720 --> 02:16:22.320]  being married having three kids working 18 hours a day I gained basically 100
[02:16:22.320 --> 02:16:25.640]  pounds and it's been a long process losing that weight in the last four
[02:16:25.640 --> 02:16:30.080]  years but if you look at the photos and the videos of what I looked like four or
[02:16:30.080 --> 02:16:34.880]  five years ago versus today the results are dramatic I'd already cleaned up my
[02:16:34.880 --> 02:16:39.560]  diet I was working out hard but I'd only lost about 20 pounds it was adding the
[02:16:39.560 --> 02:16:44.720]  other key ingredients from m4slife.com that helped me personally go to the
[02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:49.640]  next level and shed another 35 pounds. This has actually made me feel so good
[02:16:49.640 --> 02:16:55.160]  that here lately about a year ago I started training jiu-jitsu and that
[02:16:55.160 --> 02:16:59.840]  kind of led to doing some boxing and kickboxing I mean it's amazing that two
[02:16:59.840 --> 02:17:05.000]  years ago I was on the couch and couldn't even tie my shoes and now I'm training
[02:17:05.000 --> 02:17:09.640]  with MMA fighters and just doing stuff that I never thought that I would be
[02:17:09.640 --> 02:17:15.440]  doing ever again so SuperMailVitality has allowed me to do some amazing things
[02:17:15.440 --> 02:17:19.680]  and if it has those kind of effects for me I know that it will do great thanks

[02:24:23.880 --> 02:24:27.560]  insider Larry served as political confidant advisor to Bill Clinton more
[02:24:27.560 --> 02:24:30.200]  than 10 years and helped Bill Clinton get elected and reelected as governor of
[02:24:30.200 --> 02:24:33.880]  Arkansas. Professor Nichols is unrestrained by political correctness
[02:24:33.880 --> 02:24:38.280]  and was specifically mentioned by Bill Clinton in his memoir LarryNichols.com
[02:24:38.280 --> 02:24:44.040]  and Larry lost basically everything he had fighting the Clintons. They didn't
[02:24:44.040 --> 02:24:47.680]  kick him out he exposed them when their criminal activity got too intense and he
[02:24:47.680 --> 02:24:51.240]  had that come to Jesus moment literally I'm not gonna get into background Larry
[02:24:51.240 --> 02:24:55.600]  Nichols most folks that are half informed know who he is but he also put
[02:24:55.600 --> 02:24:59.280]  out films like how the Tea Party can fight back and win he's explained why
[02:24:59.280 --> 02:25:04.040]  they're involved in divide and conquer I want to get into Hillary's next strategy
[02:25:04.040 --> 02:25:09.600]  in the next long segment and more and and how he thinks they're gonna try to
[02:25:09.600 --> 02:25:13.640]  take out Carson and Trump but before we do that in this short segment Larry I
[02:25:13.640 --> 02:25:17.400]  want to thank you for coming on ask how you're doing your own via video Skype
[02:25:17.400 --> 02:25:19.920]  you look pretty good I know you're fighting them illness we've been
[02:25:19.920 --> 02:25:23.520]  praying for you but first off tell us how you're doing and then
[02:25:23.520 --> 02:25:27.800]  secondarily what do you make of all the takeover of the universities and all
[02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:31.480]  this I mean this is all federally run they admitted what is the point of that
[02:25:31.480 --> 02:25:35.520]  I mean the Justice Department the White House already runs everything what are
[02:25:35.520 --> 02:25:40.760]  they doing well Alex first off let me apologize for the way I look I just got
[02:25:40.760 --> 02:25:45.120]  here from the hospital just literally minutes before so forgive me for looking
[02:25:45.120 --> 02:25:51.800]  kind of yucky I'm gonna tell you everything's on track Alex everything
[02:25:51.800 --> 02:25:58.520]  couple odd things that that make it a bit confusing number one what's going on
[02:25:58.520 --> 02:26:05.520]  Alex we're in stage three with Hillary in the playbook stage one is when you're
[02:26:05.520 --> 02:26:09.320]  getting in you go out to get all the money take all the money out of the room
[02:26:09.320 --> 02:26:15.440]  so nobody else getting in is gonna have it easy to get in also in stage one you
[02:26:15.440 --> 02:26:21.120]  literally take out your opposition anybody that's going to run against you
[02:26:21.120 --> 02:26:28.000]  you scare them out of the race now stage two is where you have to facilitate
[02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:33.720]  Hillary coming in as the underdog which of course in this case stage two was the
[02:26:33.720 --> 02:26:38.080]  email and you said that two months ago and I kind of didn't roll my eyes I
[02:26:38.080 --> 02:26:42.000]  respect you but now they literally say she's back she's invincible she's an
[02:26:42.000 --> 02:26:46.680]  underdog exactly what you said they're following your playbook you develop for
[02:26:46.680 --> 02:26:50.600]  him as you said exactly exactly that's what I've always told you Alex this is
[02:26:50.600 --> 02:26:54.880]  where it gets tricky they know I know what they're gonna do next they know I
[02:26:54.880 --> 02:26:59.600]  know everything they're gonna do but bitch and they know I'm telling it but
[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:06.240]  they still got to do it they still got to do it and to the audience for all that
[02:27:06.240 --> 02:27:12.880]  I've done to this country by developing a system that she mess up pray for your
[02:27:12.880 --> 02:27:20.480]  country and Alex I will stop Hillary but I'll stop her my way my time and it's
[02:27:20.480 --> 02:27:23.640]  very important that people understand cuz I get it all the time well if you could
[02:27:23.640 --> 02:27:26.760]  stop Hillary get in and do it now well if I do then you're gonna sit there and
[02:27:26.760 --> 02:27:32.160]  you're gonna get something as bad if not worse number one number two we're
[02:27:32.160 --> 02:27:37.640]  running real close to Obama's stand you know he's dropping hints every day Alex
[02:27:37.640 --> 02:27:44.840]  getting more bold about wanting to stay and I'm telling you we get rid of Hillary
[02:27:44.840 --> 02:27:53.040]  too soon Obama pull history now about these college campuses I've never been
[02:27:53.040 --> 02:27:56.880]  so ashamed of somebody in my life is that college when they succumbed to that
[02:27:56.880 --> 02:28:05.240]  because now now that these antagonists have seen it work now they're gonna be
[02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:10.560]  doing it more every time black lives matter or somebody gets fired up in the
[02:28:10.560 --> 02:28:14.920]  least they're gonna use this to resolve it because I'm telling you to the major
[02:28:14.920 --> 02:28:19.800]  colleges Alex I don't need to take you but to the major colleges that's big
[02:28:19.800 --> 02:28:25.840]  money coming in game day it's just ridiculous to see how they're dividing
[02:28:25.840 --> 02:28:31.760]  everybody it's so cold-blooded but it's the broken broken coalition coalition
[02:28:31.760 --> 02:28:36.800]  and it works every time you know that's what I guess people don't understand the
[02:28:36.800 --> 02:28:43.480]  very first rule of the playbook Alex the biggest rule number one times ten
[02:28:43.480 --> 02:28:51.080]  thousand is that no matter what if something's working you never change
[02:28:51.080 --> 02:28:59.880]  that's right never change formulaic yeah I mean it's just it's done so now when
[02:28:59.880 --> 02:29:03.960]  Hillary got off the playbook when she read against Obama she got her butt kicked
[02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:10.600]  and she shouldn't have this time it's the system this time Alex we're in the
[02:29:10.600 --> 02:29:17.720]  beginning of the beginning of the feature match I've always promised you me
[02:29:17.720 --> 02:29:25.560]  in the bitch me and the other and I assure you she does not like the news
[02:29:25.560 --> 02:29:30.880]  that bring well I can see that you are savoring the fact that you're gonna tell
[02:29:30.880 --> 02:29:37.080]  us what phase three is straight ahead Larry Nichols is our guest ladies and
[02:29:37.080 --> 02:29:39.840]  gentlemen Larry Nichols dot com we'll see about some of the other films and

[02:29:51.400 --> 02:30:01.760]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network a proposed EU law puts the simple act of
[02:30:01.760 --> 02:30:06.560]  linking to content under copyright protection Julia Reda a German activist
[02:30:06.560 --> 02:30:10.960]  puts it this way the European Commission is preparing a frontal attack on the
[02:30:10.960 --> 02:30:15.760]  hyperlink the basic building block of the internet as we know it this is based
[02:30:15.760 --> 02:30:21.560]  on an absurd idea that just won't die making search engines and news portals
[02:30:21.560 --> 02:30:25.600]  pay media companies for promoting their freely accessible articles
[02:30:25.600 --> 02:30:30.760]  reticites a drought communication on copyright reform leaked last week the
[02:30:30.760 --> 02:30:34.640]  ideas expressed by the document challenged the existing interpretation
[02:30:34.640 --> 02:30:38.920]  in spirit of a law as well as common sense each web link would become a
[02:30:38.920 --> 02:30:43.560]  legal landmine and would allow press publishers to hold every single actor
[02:30:43.560 --> 02:30:48.280]  on the internet liable she went on to explain Reda believes the EU will try
[02:30:48.280 --> 02:30:52.960]  to slide this through under the guise of clearing up unanswered questions you

[02:33:12.440 --> 02:33:16.240]  GCN radio network
[02:33:19.200 --> 02:33:24.440]  entering the danger zone Hillary the Titanic goblin attacking America on
[02:33:24.440 --> 02:33:29.800]  every front meanwhile Obama eyes keeping his operatives in power shooting
[02:33:29.800 --> 02:33:35.000]  down Hillary and perhaps bringing in somebody else meanwhile is Trump for
[02:33:35.000 --> 02:33:38.360]  real what dirty tricks will they play against him we've already seen what's
[02:33:38.360 --> 02:33:43.800]  going on with Carson meanwhile at drudge report com college students walk out
[02:33:43.800 --> 02:33:47.160]  across the country exactly what we said what happened days ago but nickel said
[02:33:47.160 --> 02:33:51.800]  what happened you see it the hysteria updates what happened at their colleges
[02:33:51.800 --> 02:33:58.160]  well just everything's racist now they march over debt and free school yeah
[02:33:58.160 --> 02:34:04.040]  you got conned by the over expensive education the deindustrialized country
[02:34:04.040 --> 02:34:08.400]  now you're in all this debt now you're gonna march for more handouts they're
[02:34:08.400 --> 02:34:13.320]  not coming just like Europe advertising all these freebies to Africa in the
[02:34:13.320 --> 02:34:18.560]  Middle East because the bankers are loaning us our own money back it's
[02:34:18.560 --> 02:34:27.400]  sick and it's a formula I'm gonna ask you this question Larry Nichols and then
[02:34:27.400 --> 02:34:30.280]  I want to ask also briefly this is important but I'm people to write it
[02:34:30.280 --> 02:34:35.880]  down who you think the best candidate is out there and I want to get into her
[02:34:35.880 --> 02:34:39.680]  third operation you know the first thing she did the second the third you said
[02:34:39.680 --> 02:34:43.040]  was coming and so far you've been pretty right though Jeff Bush is in deep
[02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:47.760]  trouble and is sinking so fast maybe that'll screw up their plan but first
[02:34:47.760 --> 02:34:52.160]  off who do you like in the Republican field what do you think about Trump I
[02:34:52.160 --> 02:34:59.640]  mean if if Donald is straight up if he's in it I've got no problem I mean what
[02:34:59.640 --> 02:35:05.160]  are we gonna do we've tried politicians Alex and that hadn't worked so why not
[02:35:05.160 --> 02:35:10.400]  give a businessman a shot I think what I'm afraid Donald's gonna run into
[02:35:10.400 --> 02:35:14.760]  Trump's gonna run into Congress that's gonna be his enemy number one and if
[02:35:14.760 --> 02:35:19.360]  that's not enough to get him then the then the Supreme Court will get him
[02:35:19.360 --> 02:35:24.760]  he's gonna walk in Alex if he's for real he's gonna walk in but he's gonna
[02:35:24.760 --> 02:35:31.480]  learn real fast that he's not the CEO of a business this is Washington DC
[02:35:31.480 --> 02:35:39.120]  government and Italy Chuck what do you think of Cruz and Paul people like that
[02:35:39.120 --> 02:35:51.360]  well of all the candidates left the one that's probably okay I do not know him
[02:35:51.360 --> 02:36:01.600]  is Cruz but they'll eliminate him you see stage 3 Alex is the phase she's got
[02:36:01.600 --> 02:36:07.800]  everything accomplished on her side of the scale now it's time to get the
[02:36:07.800 --> 02:36:13.960]  Republican field lined up the way she wants it now on her own bush thing
[02:36:13.960 --> 02:36:21.600]  everybody's got to know is that the rules to these debates are open so in
[02:36:21.600 --> 02:36:26.040]  other words the people throwing the debate have said quite clearly that it's
[02:36:26.040 --> 02:36:30.720]  not just poll driven they said something last night it's also connected to the
[02:36:30.720 --> 02:36:34.800]  money in the bank whether candidates got enough money to win and of course
[02:36:34.800 --> 02:36:39.800]  Bush has already got Alex the money he would need to run primary and a general
[02:36:39.800 --> 02:36:46.120]  election so they just intimidate or have scandals and shut everybody down it's
[02:36:46.120 --> 02:36:49.360]  like Nixon's climbing over the dead political bodies he'll be the last man
[02:36:49.360 --> 02:36:53.240]  standing so they don't care if nobody likes him he's low in the polls they'll
[02:36:53.240 --> 02:36:59.320]  just force him in matter a bit will not matter one bit Alex it's it's the way
[02:36:59.320 --> 02:37:03.560]  the system works it's the way it's all put up I notice you put some stuff up
[02:37:03.560 --> 02:37:08.480]  there on the screen Alex I do need to make one absolutely I was about to get

[02:38:50.400 --> 02:38:54.320]  phase three recap those and and because you're you're right you said they'll
[02:38:54.320 --> 02:38:58.360]  bill her as an underdog say she's Teflon again and sure enough I saw those
[02:38:58.360 --> 02:39:02.200]  headlines last week about a month and a half after you said that but still what
[02:39:02.200 --> 02:39:05.920]  about her health drudges pointed this out others she looks like hell you say
[02:39:05.920 --> 02:39:10.000]  you look bad you don't look that bad like I have a Western or something she
[02:39:10.000 --> 02:39:14.880]  she looks like she is I mean I know Bill's big into drugs and looks like he's
[02:39:14.880 --> 02:39:19.520]  pretty sick but I mean what's she into I don't Alex I don't know but she's
[02:39:19.520 --> 02:39:24.520]  starting to look bad very bad now the health issues that I've checked all the
[02:39:24.520 --> 02:39:29.240]  way up the health issues not something that's going to knock her out of being
[02:39:29.240 --> 02:39:37.640]  able to run I'm just telling you wait a minute oh let me say this thanks to
[02:39:37.640 --> 02:39:44.600]  Beverly she just sent $20 paper oh how wonderful thank you Mr. Beverly Alex
[02:39:44.600 --> 02:39:51.800]  she's it's just so simple you know I mean this whole election cycle it's so
[02:39:51.800 --> 02:39:56.280]  simple the media is hyping it up Alex because I don't need to tell you there's
[02:39:56.280 --> 02:40:00.440]  a lot of money going around a lot of advertising money going to be spent on
[02:40:00.440 --> 02:40:05.600]  this presidential race and it's huge money and it's huge money to these
[02:40:05.600 --> 02:40:10.880]  networks and that's why the networks are doing everything they can to make this
[02:40:10.880 --> 02:40:17.480]  race interesting now what we're doing here with you is we're telling the
[02:40:17.480 --> 02:40:21.680]  truth we're telling the truth how this thing is gonna end up and for the first
[02:40:21.680 --> 02:40:28.800]  time Alex your audience is seeing from the inside how this thing has been rigged
[02:40:28.800 --> 02:40:34.280]  throughout the years to where we always get the lesser of two evils and then
[02:40:34.280 --> 02:40:38.240]  we seem to always get worse you know it just do you think they're lining up
[02:40:38.240 --> 02:40:44.000]  what's your Hillary then they're lining up Hillary they gotta remember when
[02:40:44.000 --> 02:40:47.800]  Hillary gets it here's the whole package Hillary gets to be president with
[02:40:47.800 --> 02:40:53.520]  six within six months she makes Bill UN ambassador and then within six months of
[02:40:53.520 --> 02:40:58.520]  that the UN because what Clinton Foundation has been pulling on them all
[02:40:58.520 --> 02:41:02.040]  these years within six months you ain't gonna make me secretary general to the
[02:41:02.040 --> 02:41:07.520]  UN and that completes the dream that Bill and Hillary have saw world
[02:41:07.520 --> 02:41:13.040]  government rulers yep and I mean there's nobody above them remember Alex when
[02:41:13.040 --> 02:41:16.560]  I used to tell you the story about Bill and I up on mountain and he'd say you
[02:41:16.560 --> 02:41:20.600]  know what the best government is and I'd say no what is it's when you
[02:41:20.600 --> 02:41:27.960]  have like ultra ultra rich people that you can fit on one hand and that's all
[02:41:27.960 --> 02:41:33.080]  you got answer to and everybody else is so poor that they're worried about food
[02:41:33.080 --> 02:41:38.040]  and shoes and clothes for the kids and you know what he'd say it's a Nick they
[02:41:38.040 --> 02:41:42.160]  don't mess with they don't have any time to mess with politics that's the
[02:41:42.160 --> 02:41:46.200]  oligarch that's why black unemployment doubled under Obama and they love it
[02:41:46.200 --> 02:41:50.720]  yeah and I said Bill that's a great government but it's coming at me so I
[02:41:50.720 --> 02:41:55.480]  who cares what you call it so there you go that's what we're in the middle of
[02:41:55.480 --> 02:42:01.120]  then on the other hand and I need not tell y'all men that y'all who was in
[02:42:01.120 --> 02:42:07.520]  the town and according to the bill board he was here begging trying to get our
[02:42:07.520 --> 02:42:12.760]  relationship stabilized that's not at all what he was here doing what he was
[02:42:12.760 --> 02:42:21.480]  here doing was well got enough sanglio and associates there I don't know we
[02:42:21.480 --> 02:42:27.520]  can thank them all here on air but just just go ahead I just saw that but Obama
[02:42:27.520 --> 02:42:33.120]  wants to turn us into an Islamic caliphate and the person that turns
[02:42:33.120 --> 02:42:43.440]  America into a caliphate Alex becomes a winner you see they win the turkey big
[02:42:43.440 --> 02:42:51.880]  time and I've never seen it this bad Alex never and I had fought throughout
[02:42:51.880 --> 02:42:56.720]  literally fought throughout the years Alex to try to avoid this day you know
[02:42:56.720 --> 02:43:01.200]  when people ask me what in the world were you doing in the rock of Afghanistan
[02:43:01.200 --> 02:43:07.240]  Central America Africa what were you doing in these places I was there Alex
[02:43:07.240 --> 02:43:12.480]  thinking that if we could fight it there my children and grandchildren would
[02:43:12.480 --> 02:43:21.040]  never have to see it here and here it is here we are and every sickening form of
[02:43:21.040 --> 02:43:26.880]  tyranny mixed together in a giant slop pot with a bunch of spoiled rotten
[02:43:26.880 --> 02:43:31.920]  people living off the you know the end of America what are all these yuppies
[02:43:31.920 --> 02:43:35.160]  and trendies and socials gonna do when it all comes crashing down and they're in
[02:43:35.160 --> 02:43:39.840]  a giant reeducation camp the whole country just a giant cesspit do they
[02:43:39.840 --> 02:43:45.520]  have any idea how much it'll be Alex these people don't know I was with the
[02:43:45.520 --> 02:43:51.720]  president of El Salvador her I'm sorry he got him under us with his daughter she
[02:43:51.720 --> 02:43:59.040]  was showing me the border country between Honduras and I said you know if
[02:43:59.040 --> 02:44:02.920]  they were trying to get us to move our base camps back across and the Nicaragua
[02:44:02.920 --> 02:44:06.320]  which would have been a death kiss or anyway I was talking her out of that but
[02:44:06.320 --> 02:44:10.200]  she made a comment that I've never forgotten Alex I said to her well these
[02:44:10.200 --> 02:44:15.040]  people have to understand they're communists over there and she said Mr.
[02:44:15.040 --> 02:44:21.880]  Nichols these campesinos they don't care it's food just exactly what Bill
[02:44:21.880 --> 02:44:28.440]  Clinton said to me is what that lady said and it's turned out to be true now
[02:44:28.440 --> 02:44:33.880]  we're fighting it here Alex and it's one of the most this is gonna become one of
[02:44:33.880 --> 02:44:40.560]  the most formidable fight this nation has ever had in the middle of there's no
[02:44:40.560 --> 02:44:46.680]  doubt because because once you make people dumb down poor they only think
[02:44:46.680 --> 02:44:51.240]  today or this week there's no more honor there's no more long term there's no
[02:44:51.240 --> 02:44:55.200]  grasp there's just desperate wild-eyedness and then the ultra elites
[02:44:55.200 --> 02:44:59.480]  just sit back and laugh what what a crime against humanity what a cold blooded
[02:44:59.480 --> 02:45:06.960]  sickening murder of the Renaissance just it's despicable crime Alex if anybody
[02:45:06.960 --> 02:45:12.760]  had seen what I've seen over the years when they come back in the cloakroom
[02:45:12.760 --> 02:45:18.400]  after having a vote and to see the high fives and everybody grinning and saying
[02:45:18.400 --> 02:45:23.400]  oh we got them again those idiots we did it to them again how many times have I
[02:45:23.400 --> 02:45:29.640]  sat in the cloakroom and heard that kind of talk and I just kind of even when I
[02:45:29.640 --> 02:45:36.920]  was with the dark side Alex that sounded a bit wrong I mean it's just wrong it's
[02:45:36.920 --> 02:45:43.160]  but we've got the best money government money can buy Alex we just don't have
[02:45:43.160 --> 02:45:47.160]  the money to buy it we the people anymore that's why it's got to be stage
[02:45:47.160 --> 02:45:53.800]  rights either we get a state or two to stand up and stand on their own two feet
[02:45:53.800 --> 02:45:58.920]  and stop and show that Washington truly has no power except that which we've
[02:45:58.920 --> 02:46:03.040]  been running around giving it we've got to get that done I agree with you here's
[02:46:03.040 --> 02:46:07.040]  the problem Oklahoma was leading a 20-something state coalition to do that
[02:46:07.040 --> 02:46:12.840]  at 94 95 right so you know what Bill did at the Murrow building to then
[02:46:12.840 --> 02:46:16.240]  project that on the states rights movement rush Limbaugh yourself and
[02:46:16.240 --> 02:46:19.960]  many others you know Clinton Chronicles caused this hate blow up this building
[02:46:19.960 --> 02:46:22.360]  when they'd done it and you know we caught them we know who did it the
[02:46:22.360 --> 02:46:25.840]  names all of it eyewitnesses from every angle FBI agents have come out it's all
[02:46:25.840 --> 02:46:29.400]  come out they had to murder people to cover it up and that's the problem the
[02:46:29.400 --> 02:46:32.920]  states are ready to stand up what do we do when they blow up federal buildings
[02:46:32.920 --> 02:46:38.520]  and blaming on us well what we're gonna do this time it's gonna be different than
[02:46:38.520 --> 02:46:43.160]  the last time I think we've got a much smarter Alex thanks to you and others
[02:46:43.160 --> 02:46:48.480]  we've got a much smarter population out there and we're gonna be warning we're
[02:46:48.480 --> 02:46:52.600]  gonna be warning you know that time it just snuck up on everybody and people
[02:46:52.600 --> 02:46:58.120]  didn't realize the people just didn't really realize how far the Clintons would
[02:46:58.120 --> 02:47:02.000]  go to get what they want about that and risk our lives further I don't care
[02:47:02.000 --> 02:47:06.440]  anymore I'm just going all the way how soon did you know it was obviously an
[02:47:06.440 --> 02:47:15.560]  inside job when that morning on April 19th I guess I really knew Alex that
[02:47:15.560 --> 02:47:20.360]  something was not right about that job the second I heard and the first things
[02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:23.520]  I heard on TV about it because it was clearly already scripted and they were
[02:47:23.520 --> 02:47:29.840]  ready right yeah it was just what I didn't know I learned from you can learn
[02:47:29.840 --> 02:47:35.640]  Alex and of course you know this watch them and you can see how they're handling
[02:47:35.640 --> 02:47:39.880]  if you're seeing professional scripts professional speeches everything in
[02:47:39.880 --> 02:47:43.080]  their hands and everybody coordinated all the way it's an ad campaign it's
[02:47:43.080 --> 02:47:48.880]  planned yeah that's all it is and it was designed to take the focus off of Bill
[02:47:48.880 --> 02:47:55.040]  at the time and remember at that time folks most y'all listening too young but
[02:47:55.040 --> 02:48:04.040]  the militias were growing left and right and that we were concerned back then as
[02:48:04.040 --> 02:48:09.240]  you know Alex about what we're concerned about today but we had militias
[02:48:09.240 --> 02:48:13.640]  forming and the militias were getting strong and getting stronger so what did
[02:48:13.640 --> 02:48:17.200]  they have to do if they had to stop the militia they had to demonize them so
[02:48:17.200 --> 02:48:23.360]  they committed a crime frame them all of a sudden boom here goes a building and
[02:48:23.360 --> 02:48:26.840]  there goes the militia let's take some hand calls with Larry Nichols
[02:48:26.840 --> 02:48:30.680]  absolutely these are such dangerous wicked people and they hate us they hate
[02:48:30.680 --> 02:48:34.080]  our freedom they hate us for the passion they I mean that's the thing they
[02:48:34.080 --> 02:48:38.120]  don't want to just rule us they want to screw us over it's like you know a
[02:48:38.120 --> 02:48:40.760]  killer wants to grab a kid out of a backyard to torture them that's what
[02:48:40.760 --> 02:48:43.840]  they want to do they don't want to grab us out of the back of the yard took his
[02:48:43.840 --> 02:48:48.000]  hamburgers no they want to grab us out of the back of the yard chain is down and
[02:48:48.000 --> 02:48:51.000]  rape the hell out of us Charlie in Texas you're on the air with Larry
[02:48:51.000 --> 02:48:58.080]  Nichols go ahead hi guys but Larry you don't see you don't see Trump is some
[02:48:58.080 --> 02:49:02.720]  kind of a bringer just be sure that Hillary gets in you know Charlie
[02:49:02.720 --> 02:49:07.480]  thanks for calling by the way you know that's where I'm at I'm exactly where
[02:49:07.480 --> 02:49:13.480]  you are exactly where Alex is where we all are you know is Trump the real deal
[02:49:13.480 --> 02:49:19.280]  or is he playing the role of Ross Perot for those that don't remember Bill
[02:49:19.280 --> 02:49:23.680]  Clinton's race against Daddy Bush there was no way he was going to win that
[02:49:23.680 --> 02:49:29.800]  race Daddy Bush if you're a rememberer had an approval rating at that time
[02:49:29.800 --> 02:49:36.960]  Alex like 90 yeah like 90% or some good balls everybody knew it was over that
[02:49:36.960 --> 02:49:40.720]  he was going to get reelected and what that was the perfect time to run Bill
[02:49:40.720 --> 02:49:46.240]  because that was the whole purpose and intent of his first run to be honest
[02:49:46.240 --> 02:49:51.280]  with everybody was to get all the woman eyes and stuff to come out and then
[02:49:51.280 --> 02:50:00.280]  when he runs again the next time it's old news nobody care but old Perot came
[02:50:00.280 --> 02:50:06.400]  along but Perot came along was probably conscious ringer yes yes they had made a
[02:50:06.400 --> 02:50:10.520]  deal with Perot for Hillary health care when Hillary's health care got put in
[02:50:10.520 --> 02:50:15.000]  place on the road he was gonna run the computer system and that was the deal
[02:50:15.000 --> 02:50:19.480]  they made and of course we don't know Perot is an intelligence operative I
[02:50:19.480 --> 02:50:24.200]  don't want to tacking but did you ever run into talking I'm gonna oh yeah let
[02:50:24.200 --> 02:50:31.160]  me let the dog in for you interrupts the show go ahead I bet Perot did stand up
[02:50:31.160 --> 02:50:34.880]  against after and get and I want to think he was a good guy but the facts are
[02:50:34.880 --> 02:50:39.000]  I guess you get to that level it's just so corrupt I was like why are these
[02:50:39.000 --> 02:50:44.000]  elites building such a pile of crap why don't they want to build something good
[02:50:44.000 --> 02:50:47.680]  so just take everything over dumb everybody down earn us into a bunch of

[02:53:02.480 --> 02:53:06.960]  levels of government are struggling against an inevitable crisis but they're
[02:53:06.960 --> 02:53:12.520]  about to lose control when this happens it will rip our country apart in ways
[02:53:12.520 --> 02:53:17.480]  you never imagined from where we shop to the doctors you visit and the family
[02:53:17.480 --> 02:53:21.720]  you want to protect look I've made predictions like this before a few years
[02:53:21.720 --> 02:53:26.320]  ago I warned that the housing prices would collapse before that I warned that
[02:53:26.320 --> 02:53:31.360]  dot-com companies would crash and they did those who listened had a chance to
[02:53:31.360 --> 02:53:35.680]  save themselves but this has nothing to do with the stock market this will
[02:53:35.680 --> 02:53:42.240]  affect us all. I've posted a free video at dollardanger.com maybe you'll

[02:54:06.000 --> 02:54:15.040]  gold dry. The interest is down and the stock market's up and the stock market's
[02:54:15.040 --> 02:54:20.680]  down and you're only getting mugged if you go downtown. We're talking to Larry
[02:54:20.680 --> 02:54:23.480]  Nichols I'm Alex Jones your host I'll be five minutes into the next hour and
[02:54:23.480 --> 02:54:26.800]  then and then you can see how he takes over we've added the fourth hour of
[02:54:26.800 --> 02:54:30.480]  conversations that want it. Let's talk to Stephen in Florida you're talking to
[02:54:30.480 --> 02:54:34.640]  Clinton insider Larry Nichols. Stephen thanks for calling and then I'll go to
[02:54:34.640 --> 02:54:40.720]  Maya and others go ahead you're on the air. Hey good afternoon Alex and hey Larry
[02:54:40.720 --> 02:54:46.320]  I just wanted to ask you I was wondering a couple months ago I wrote to you I
[02:54:46.320 --> 02:54:51.480]  sent you a letter and I sent a poem that I wrote using the names of Bill and
[02:54:51.480 --> 02:54:56.400]  Hillary Clinton each letter and there that was the first letter of the poem
[02:54:56.400 --> 02:55:07.880]  lines I was wondering if you got that and what you thought about that. Remember all of it but I remember it was the way you did it. You did a good job.
[02:55:07.880 --> 02:55:12.160]  Alright God bless you Stephen I'm gonna jump let's talk to Maya in Kansas you're
[02:55:12.160 --> 02:55:18.680]  on the air Maya go ahead. Hi I'm gonna go quick on this black American here
[02:55:18.680 --> 02:55:23.600]  totally uncomfortable even I don't even want to refer to myself as Republican or
[02:55:23.600 --> 02:55:27.280]  libertarian because everything is so twisted I just don't want to be
[02:55:27.280 --> 02:55:33.080]  affiliated. I understand. Yeah now we've got Donald Trump sitting up here doing
[02:55:33.080 --> 02:55:39.360]  the miraculous is it possible that even the Bilderberg group might have pulled
[02:55:39.360 --> 02:55:45.880]  Donald over to the side because they too started recognizing the power that was
[02:55:45.880 --> 02:55:53.800]  really taking place within the Clinton. That's right couldn't the elite themselves be
[02:55:53.800 --> 02:55:58.840]  sick of the Clintons. Yes that's another thing that that runs a chance of
[02:55:58.840 --> 02:56:05.840]  helping us Alex but right now it's all delicate it's incredibly delicate and
[02:56:05.840 --> 02:56:09.600]  there's a there's a lot going on in Washington that people aren't hearing
[02:56:09.600 --> 02:56:14.600]  about or seeing because this is Alex I'm gonna say this is probably the most
[02:56:14.600 --> 02:56:20.760]  turbulent time I have seen and I mean it's really striking home in Washington
[02:56:20.760 --> 02:56:25.200]  those guys know that people are fed up they're done they know that but they're
[02:56:25.200 --> 02:56:29.560]  trying to figure a new way new angle to be able to get it all straight back out
[02:56:29.560 --> 02:56:35.000]  again now I'm telling you I'm telling you all this thing that that group did in
[02:56:35.000 --> 02:56:41.300]  Missouri and the action that the state of Missouri did by letting the guy
[02:56:41.300 --> 02:56:45.760]  resign I'm telling you that said it's a precedent that this thing's gonna burn
[02:56:45.760 --> 02:56:51.440]  now Alex gonna burn and that's what the establishment wants is more divide and
[02:56:51.440 --> 02:56:57.120]  conquer great question great point Maya anything else nope she's gone let's go
[02:56:57.120 --> 02:57:02.600]  who's up next in order here guys Alex in Michigan you're on the air go ahead
[02:57:02.600 --> 02:57:08.520]  with Larry Nichols hey what's going on you guys good going Alex I just wanted
[02:57:08.520 --> 02:57:13.120]  to say thanks Alex for your business model I'm modeling myself after your
[02:57:13.120 --> 02:57:19.200]  business model thank you good and my model is fighting tyranny and funding
[02:57:19.200 --> 02:57:24.440]  in ourselves and being a free marketer yeah that's really the way to go man
[02:57:24.440 --> 02:57:29.320]  that's the way to go um you have a question for Larry Nichols yeah I was
[02:57:29.320 --> 02:57:34.840]  gonna say that the whole thing at the college in Yale and Missouri I guess now
[02:57:34.840 --> 02:57:41.160]  to I guarantee it's going bones the Satanist group I guarantee that's them

[02:57:53.200 --> 02:57:58.440]  now is you're seeing what has been being laid out Alex for years since I was
[02:57:58.440 --> 02:58:02.040]  with the Clintons back all the way in 86 not to mention when I was with McClellan
[02:58:02.040 --> 02:58:08.960]  Fulbright and all of those guys this is it this is it this is the time when all
[02:58:08.960 --> 02:58:15.360]  of these different groups in Washington are making their plans and they're
[02:58:15.360 --> 02:58:18.760]  fixing to make their attack now we've got three or four different groups you've
[02:58:18.760 --> 02:58:22.680]  got the Clinton group going for our governor you got the Obama group going
[02:58:22.680 --> 02:58:28.480]  for our governor then on top of that she got the spring court and people in
[02:58:28.480 --> 02:58:32.040]  Congress they're all trying to put back you got all these foundations that can
[02:58:32.040 --> 02:58:34.800]  terrorize the universities that thought they were their friends they're
[02:58:34.800 --> 02:58:38.880]  piratically hijacking them it's just total robbery at every level I mean that
[02:58:38.880 --> 02:58:42.360]  that's the only order this there is they put a giant screw job in place it's

[03:01:27.200 --> 03:01:30.760]  the end and then and then but Oklahoma was about to pass it and really cause the
[03:01:30.760 --> 03:01:36.560]  domino effect really was it boy when Charlie T went in there and he said

[03:02:10.640 --> 03:02:14.760]  Coyote's been calling him for 20 years what's your question for Larry's we're
[03:02:14.760 --> 03:02:22.320]  almost out of time the question for Larry is this how given what you know and
[03:02:22.320 --> 03:02:27.240]  the playbook and where we are yeah how do we stop Hillary same thing you said
[03:02:27.240 --> 03:02:34.520]  earlier how do you stop Hillary there is something Alex that you will have one
[03:02:34.520 --> 03:02:40.320]  of these days pretty soon I don't think you'll be thanking me for it just yeah
[03:02:40.320 --> 03:02:43.640]  please don't tell me something that'll bring down the clumsens please just put
[03:02:43.640 --> 03:02:51.160]  it out publicly yourself don't give me a hanger name so but anyway what happens
[03:02:51.160 --> 03:02:55.320]  they moved that body Alex whether he killed himself or somebody killed him
[03:02:55.320 --> 03:03:01.640]  that's not an area now that I look at what I look at is I can prove they
[03:03:01.640 --> 03:03:05.640]  moved that body okay so you think the ghost of Vince Foster could come back
[03:03:05.640 --> 03:03:10.480]  and haunt them no I know it will and they know it will as well that's why
[03:03:10.480 --> 03:03:17.640]  they don't want me doing what I'm doing the thing people need to know about the
[03:03:17.640 --> 03:03:22.120]  death of Vince Foster it was ruled a suicide at the time but it's still
[03:03:22.120 --> 03:03:27.960]  carried as a murder any homicide so there's no statute limitations on any I
[03:03:27.960 --> 03:03:35.120]  repeat on any aspect of that case now the feature match between Hillary and I
[03:03:35.120 --> 03:03:40.600]  was predicated off a couple of things the first being what you know Alex who
[03:03:40.600 --> 03:03:46.440]  you call I mean if I had a picture of Hillary shooting Vince Foster with a
[03:03:46.440 --> 03:03:52.440]  gun if I had that on videotape we run into the problem of this power
[03:03:52.440 --> 03:03:58.280]  syndrome that's in Washington now who you're gonna call to get them to go
[03:03:58.280 --> 03:04:05.240]  after Hillary who now you say well Obama appointed this new lady with the FBI
[03:04:05.240 --> 03:04:11.800]  well I doubt very seriously she's even confirmed before the election she might
[03:04:11.800 --> 03:04:18.280]  I could be wrong about that but she's not gonna do anything to Hillary all of
[03:04:18.280 --> 03:04:23.680]  this stuff everybody hears about the emails forget it please it comes down
[03:04:23.680 --> 03:04:30.280]  to this Alex and this and this alone if they try to prosecute Hillary her
[03:04:30.280 --> 03:04:35.840]  defense attorney is gonna say your honor we need to have all of the emails so
[03:04:35.840 --> 03:04:39.480]  that we can make our case and it's gonna make some of them go public that are
[03:04:39.480 --> 03:04:42.480]  classified in top secret and they point out it's classified so they can't
[03:04:42.480 --> 03:04:46.080]  release us you can't use it as evidence if you use them as the defense Larry
[03:04:46.080 --> 03:04:50.120]  will talk to you soon I we're praying for you hope you're getting better and
[03:04:50.120 --> 03:04:55.200]  and have a good weekend coming up folks other callers to probably able to get to

[03:08:46.160 --> 03:08:51.760]  daily newspapers down nearly 80% hard news in danger cable companies are so
[03:08:51.760 --> 03:08:55.200]  scared of Netflix they've actually started showing fewer ads they're
[03:08:55.200 --> 03:08:58.280]  dropping their ads by 50% because they're afraid of the growing media

[03:09:31.320 --> 03:09:36.080]  special report by John bound about how smart TVs are now made to spy on you
[03:09:36.080 --> 03:09:40.280]  this is something that you've heard Alex talk about before years and years ago
[03:09:40.280 --> 03:09:44.800]  and it was called a true conspiracy theory I mean it was just attacked at
[03:09:44.800 --> 03:09:48.800]  the idea that your TV would be watching you but of course now it's come to pass
[03:09:48.800 --> 03:09:52.880]  it's recording everything you do it's monitoring what you do and here's John
[03:09:52.880 --> 03:09:58.880]  John bounds report on smart TVs watching you back smart TV meet your stupid
[03:09:58.880 --> 03:10:03.840]  consumer Irvine California based Vizio is churning out spy state
[03:10:03.840 --> 03:10:09.480]  televisions loaded with Vizio smart interactivity program to its 10
[03:10:09.480 --> 03:10:13.720]  million and counting customers a default program that follows your viewing
[03:10:13.720 --> 03:10:18.160]  habits and spins a web of data connected to your smartphone and any other
[03:10:18.160 --> 03:10:23.320]  device linked to your IP address pro publica reports IP addresses can
[03:10:23.320 --> 03:10:28.040]  increasingly be linked to individuals data broker experience for instance
[03:10:28.040 --> 03:10:33.600]  offers a data enrichment service that provide hundreds of attributes such as
[03:10:33.600 --> 03:10:39.720]  age profession and wealth indicators tied to a particular IP address Vizio
[03:10:39.720 --> 03:10:44.600]  recently updated its privacy policy to say it has begun providing data about
[03:10:44.600 --> 03:10:49.080]  customers viewing habits to companies that may combine this information with
[03:10:49.080 --> 03:10:54.320]  other information about devices associated with that IP address the
[03:10:54.320 --> 03:10:59.600]  company does not promise to encrypt IP addresses before sharing them of course
[03:10:59.600 --> 03:11:04.960]  there are laws against this very overreach of big brother US code title
[03:11:04.960 --> 03:11:12.600]  47 chapter 5 protection of subscriber privacy and US code title 18 chapter 121
[03:11:12.600 --> 03:11:18.040]  wrongful disclosure of videotape rental or sale records not to mention the video
[03:11:18.040 --> 03:11:23.000]  privacy Protection Act but Vizio arrogantly declares those laws don't
[03:11:23.000 --> 03:11:28.400]  apply to them Vizio vaguely claims IP addresses contain data rather than a
[03:11:28.400 --> 03:11:34.000]  person's identity but that is the very nature of this surveillance beast an IP
[03:11:34.000 --> 03:11:38.640]  address identification system increasingly used to build a profile of a
[03:11:38.640 --> 03:11:44.360]  person according to their viewing habits is a system already regarded as a breach
[03:11:44.360 --> 03:11:49.200]  of individual privacy in Europe but Vizio reaffirms that the rat in a cage
[03:11:49.200 --> 03:11:54.400]  technology is all in the name of advertising according to Vizio the
[03:11:54.400 --> 03:11:59.720]  company's data mining programs are part of a revolutionary shift across all
[03:11:59.720 --> 03:12:05.080]  screens that brings measurability relevancy and personalization to the
[03:12:05.080 --> 03:12:10.680]  consumer like never before again personalization the surveillance state is
[03:12:10.680 --> 03:12:15.760]  tracking us in our homes all of the new washing machines dryers computers
[03:12:15.760 --> 03:12:20.440]  iPhones have cameras that are two-way have audio that's two-way and they
[03:12:20.440 --> 03:12:27.160]  admit they're tracking you and there is a report out of wired magazine with
[03:12:27.160 --> 03:12:34.800]  public statements by Petraeus now the head of the CIA that they are watching
[03:12:34.800 --> 03:12:37.760]  everybody through their appliances without warrants and they'll do whatever
[03:12:37.760 --> 03:12:42.880]  they want and you're not a suspect you're a person of interest look as we
[03:12:42.880 --> 03:12:48.080]  expose that you run al Qaeda you mean stuff like that so these people are
[03:12:48.080 --> 03:12:54.280]  just going into a new phase of flaunting it all in our face spying on us
[03:12:54.280 --> 03:12:59.680]  through our cable boxes and televisions monitoring and determining our energy
[03:12:59.680 --> 03:13:03.840]  usage the surveillance state is so completely out of control in its
[03:13:03.840 --> 03:13:07.960]  widespread violation of our fourth amendment rights billion dollar
[03:13:07.960 --> 03:13:11.920]  surveillance blimps are having to be shotgunned out of the sky by law
[03:13:11.920 --> 03:13:16.720]  enforcement Vizio is playing with fire all it's gonna take is one of their 10
[03:13:16.720 --> 03:13:20.920]  million customers identities to be positively profiled and the first
[03:13:20.920 --> 03:13:26.960]  domino will fall there is a single broadcast every second of every day
[03:13:26.960 --> 03:13:33.080]  through our television sets even when the set is turned off impulses are being
[03:13:33.080 --> 03:13:38.120]  redirected we are living in an artificially induced state of consciousness
[03:13:38.120 --> 03:13:44.120]  that resembles the core and the underclass are growing racial justice
[03:13:44.120 --> 03:13:50.560]  and human rights are non-existent they have created a repressive society and
[03:13:50.560 --> 03:13:57.200]  we are there unwitting accomplices John bound for info wars dot com that's
[03:13:57.200 --> 03:14:01.120]  right the surveillance state is here and something that you've heard about for
[03:14:01.120 --> 03:14:05.120]  years and was deemed a conspiracy theory has now come true I'm gonna take it a
[03:14:05.120 --> 03:14:11.000]  step further and talk about this report which is from disrupt Facebook faces
[03:14:11.000 --> 03:14:15.920]  fines of 268,000 per day for tracking non-users in Belgium
[03:14:15.920 --> 03:14:21.600]  Facebook is facing fines of 260,000 a day unless it alters the operation of
[03:14:21.600 --> 03:14:25.520]  tracking cookies in Belgium after a data protection court ruling Facebook has
[03:14:25.520 --> 03:14:28.320]  said it will be appealing the court action dates back to June when the
[03:14:28.320 --> 03:14:32.680]  country's data protection watchdog filed a civil suit against Facebook following
[03:14:32.680 --> 03:14:36.160]  a highly cited critical report of Facebook's data protection practices
[03:14:36.160 --> 03:14:39.960]  which the Belgian DPA Commission following updates to Facebook's privacy
[03:14:39.960 --> 03:14:44.200]  policy at the start of the year and basically what I understand this to be
[03:14:44.200 --> 03:14:48.720]  is that when fate when you are not even logged in but basically have logged in
[03:14:48.720 --> 03:14:53.440]  to Facebook at any point it puts cookies into your browser everything you do it
[03:14:53.440 --> 03:14:57.200]  can use to track you for third-party marketing purposes of course they sell
[03:14:57.200 --> 03:15:00.920]  your data to third-party marketers and then they hit you with advertisements
[03:15:00.920 --> 03:15:04.040]  that are relevant to what you've been looking at and Belgium says this is
[03:15:04.040 --> 03:15:09.520]  unacceptable and it is because obviously they're taking your personal data and
[03:15:09.520 --> 03:15:13.320]  selling it for profit without your permission but you do actually agree to
[03:15:13.320 --> 03:15:17.760]  it just because you decided to agree to the 300 page
[03:15:17.760 --> 03:15:22.400]  privacy policy that none of us actually read it's like the common knowledge now
[03:15:22.400 --> 03:15:27.000]  when you get a new app on your phone and it says well you okay in order to use
[03:15:27.000 --> 03:15:31.600]  this app you have to agree to the 50 page privacy policy no one actually reads
[03:15:31.600 --> 03:15:36.040]  it and you need a degree and about 30 years of your life to read all the
[03:15:36.040 --> 03:15:40.120]  privacy policies you agree to but in there it says we take all of your
[03:15:40.120 --> 03:15:44.920]  data and we sell it for our own benefit and share it with our partners our
[03:15:44.920 --> 03:15:50.200]  content partners to give you a better advertising experience so the security
[03:15:50.200 --> 03:15:55.840]  protocols in there are a complete joke and the surveillance state is already
[03:15:55.840 --> 03:16:00.600]  here but it kind of reminds me of these stories as well from the examiner media
[03:16:00.600 --> 03:16:06.440]  graveyard daily newspapers down near the 80% hard news in danger and I want to
[03:16:06.440 --> 03:16:10.800]  read this article for you but what has happened is the mainstream news for so
[03:16:10.800 --> 03:16:17.040]  long kind of called us crazy anyone being us that would speak against the
[03:16:17.040 --> 03:16:20.840]  surveillance state even any individuals and they said well if you if you would
[03:16:20.840 --> 03:16:24.080]  dare to speak against that you're crazy your conspiracy theories and so on and
[03:16:24.080 --> 03:16:27.280]  that's just one sector that the mainstream media has completely
[03:16:27.280 --> 03:16:31.560]  arrogantly been incorrect or at least covered up on so people are going away
[03:16:31.560 --> 03:16:36.360]  in droves from these groups and this story goes on to say hard news faces the
[03:16:36.360 --> 03:16:39.720]  same kind of extinction as newspapers and magazines the result of a dramatic
[03:16:39.720 --> 03:16:43.640]  death spiral of reporting jobs and ads and the rise of the type of opinion
[03:16:43.640 --> 03:16:47.040]  journalism popular two and three centuries ago according to a new report
[03:16:47.040 --> 03:16:51.000]  hard news is in danger said a new report from the Brookings Institute the
[03:16:51.000 --> 03:16:54.320]  report detailed a fall off in advertising revenues and employment and
[03:16:54.320 --> 03:16:57.520]  raised the question that without editorial employees filtering the news
[03:16:57.520 --> 03:17:02.320]  credibility will be undermined these trends have left many people wondering
[03:17:02.320 --> 03:17:05.520]  who will collect hard news for the general public while the internet world
[03:17:05.520 --> 03:17:08.720]  has made it possible for everyone to express their opinion widely whether
[03:17:08.720 --> 03:17:12.560]  they know anything or not you like how it throws that in there whether they know
[03:17:12.560 --> 03:17:18.920]  anything or not yes you cannot trust the internet what an old-school concept of
[03:17:18.920 --> 03:17:22.560]  you can't believe everything you read on the internet right
[03:17:22.560 --> 03:17:27.800]  remember back in the day when you would watch television shows and nightly news
[03:17:27.800 --> 03:17:31.280]  and they would say well the story here from the internet but you can't believe
[03:17:31.280 --> 03:17:35.680]  everything you write read on that dang internet come on the internet is the
[03:17:35.680 --> 03:17:42.160]  media the internet is the new system the internet is it not newspapers the
[03:17:42.160 --> 03:17:46.880]  internet is the media and you are the media and you have just as much value as
[03:17:46.880 --> 03:17:53.880]  the mega corporation that spends $65 million on PR and the internet is the
[03:17:53.880 --> 03:17:58.040]  great divider but it says you know whether they know anything or not it has
[03:17:58.040 --> 03:18:02.320]  also confused readers the internet's confused readers in the absence of
[03:18:02.320 --> 03:18:06.000]  supposedly neutral intermediaries such as reporters fact-checkers and editors
[03:18:06.000 --> 03:18:11.800]  readers are having a hard time judging the credibility of what they read that
[03:18:11.800 --> 03:18:16.880]  dang internet man filling in hard news gaps appears to be more opinion
[03:18:16.880 --> 03:18:23.080]  journalism so here's what this really means man remember the good old days
[03:18:23.080 --> 03:18:25.760]  when the corporate news completely controlled the narrative and the
[03:18:25.760 --> 03:18:30.440]  paradigm as a whole that internet really messed that up for people because
[03:18:30.440 --> 03:18:34.440]  anyone can be a reporter anyone can put out a YouTube video with their iPhone
[03:18:34.440 --> 03:18:40.920]  and get 50 million views and it's been done with their dang opinions but it's
[03:18:40.920 --> 03:18:44.520]  confusing people guys you're not allowed to have opinions it's supposed to be
[03:18:44.520 --> 03:18:49.200]  corporate controlled news don't you understand it's messing up the narrative
[03:18:49.200 --> 03:18:56.280]  truth is this is the biggest success I think in human history in terms of the
[03:18:56.280 --> 03:19:00.360]  distribution of content because of course there's the kook stuff out there
[03:19:00.360 --> 03:19:04.960]  there's the absolutely insane stuff that people can make up and throw on some
[03:19:04.960 --> 03:19:09.080]  website that lets anyone be a content creator but at the same time the corporate
[03:19:09.080 --> 03:19:13.000]  news structure no longer controls what you are going to believe because of the
[03:19:13.000 --> 03:19:16.520]  fact that you have the power to upload directly to YouTube and I don't know how
[03:19:16.520 --> 03:19:22.560]  many times I've seen crappy looking YouTube videos selfie shot phone videos
[03:19:22.560 --> 03:19:27.560]  not even from an iPhone from like a hundred like a $50 crappy phone uploaded
[03:19:27.560 --> 03:19:31.640]  to YouTube of some guy just talking speaking his mind and it gets millions
[03:19:31.640 --> 03:19:34.520]  and millions of views because it's about the idea it's about the message not
[03:19:34.520 --> 03:19:37.160]  about the corporate news spending millions and millions of dollars I'm

[03:24:22.480 --> 03:24:28.800]  and Alex talking about the new product at infowarslife.com living defense the
[03:24:28.800 --> 03:24:33.600]  harmful organism cleanser let's check it out Dr. Group joins us for the balance
[03:24:33.600 --> 03:24:37.080]  of the sour talk about solutions we have them up every couple weeks we have
[03:24:37.080 --> 03:24:41.200]  been trying to launch this for the last year we got all of the organic
[03:24:41.200 --> 03:24:45.520]  ingredients to do it and we've come up with a new living defense harmful
[03:24:45.520 --> 03:24:50.760]  organism cleansing dietary supplement and it is extremely affordable it is
[03:24:50.760 --> 03:24:55.680]  brimming with the capsules and the way I read the facts this could do a cleanse
[03:24:55.680 --> 03:25:00.080]  for really a family of four or five people Dr. Group let's just get into the
[03:25:00.080 --> 03:25:03.400]  product now and then into parasites themselves what folks really want to
[03:25:03.400 --> 03:25:06.440]  hear about in the next segment but thank you for developing this for
[03:25:06.440 --> 03:25:11.040]  infowarslife.com tell us about living defense and why it's so special well
[03:25:11.040 --> 03:25:15.200]  it's really special because it's part of the problem that we're dealing with
[03:25:15.200 --> 03:25:20.040]  today when the earth becomes sick and the earth soils become acidic and the
[03:25:20.040 --> 03:25:25.360]  internal bodies become acidic because of all the toxic food and the air and the
[03:25:25.360 --> 03:25:30.040]  beverages that people are consuming it sets up an environment that's right for
[03:25:30.040 --> 03:25:35.920]  harmful organisms to live either on the earth that's why a lot of the plants are
[03:25:35.920 --> 03:25:40.640]  infested with harmful organisms or inside the body and years ago we linked
[03:25:40.640 --> 03:25:46.280]  every single disease process to an overgrowth of organisms in the body and
[03:25:46.280 --> 03:25:51.920]  when people hear the word parasite which the FDA does not like us to use they
[03:25:51.920 --> 03:25:56.120]  actually came down on us and made us take the word parasite off everywhere
[03:25:56.120 --> 03:26:01.360]  because we were exposing what the globalists have been doing spreading
[03:26:01.360 --> 03:26:06.560]  these parasites and creating this environment which is great for them to
[03:26:06.560 --> 03:26:10.000]  live in for years and years and years because they know they drain us of
[03:26:10.000 --> 03:26:16.000]  energy they make us sick so we had to actually change the word parasite to
[03:26:16.000 --> 03:26:20.800]  harmful organism and when we talked about harmful organisms it's the
[03:26:20.800 --> 03:26:26.560]  definition actually the medical definition of parasite is any harmful
[03:26:26.560 --> 03:26:32.200]  organism that lives off of a host mechanism most people just think
[03:26:32.200 --> 03:26:38.200]  parasites are worms but harmful organisms are bacteria viruses that you can get
[03:26:38.200 --> 03:26:43.520]  through flu shots funguses yeast we literally have an epidemic going on
[03:26:43.520 --> 03:26:48.160]  right now with molds and fungus and yeast living in everybody's body this is
[03:26:48.160 --> 03:26:51.840]  something when I heard about over a decade ago it did really believe I did
[03:26:51.840 --> 03:26:57.800]  one of these cleanses or invasive organism or harmful organism cleanses it
[03:26:57.800 --> 03:27:02.520]  really hurt a lot but it did do a lot with this this was not painful like some
[03:27:02.520 --> 03:27:07.840]  other cleanses I've done the product is available at infowarslife.com I've
[03:27:07.840 --> 03:27:12.640]  always read and heard that just one of the ingredients black walnuts you know
[03:27:12.640 --> 03:27:17.280]  is really good at flushing parasites and then you know animals out in the fields
[03:27:17.280 --> 03:27:21.000]  eat them and stuff to naturally do this we do cleanses on our dogs our cats our
[03:27:21.000 --> 03:27:25.320]  horses our cows why not us well because they don't want you to know about that
[03:27:25.320 --> 03:27:29.520]  you need to do a parasite or a harmful organism cleanse that's the thing it's
[03:27:29.520 --> 03:27:33.160]  so secretive and when we were doing our research into the root cause of every
[03:27:33.160 --> 03:27:38.320]  single disease there's been plenty of proof a lot of it's been burned and
[03:27:38.320 --> 03:27:44.720]  gotten rid of over the years that the majority of diseases are caused by some
[03:27:44.720 --> 03:27:48.680]  sort of overgrowth of harmful organisms in the body as a matter of fact the
[03:27:48.680 --> 03:27:53.520]  World Health Organization came out a couple years ago and said 3.5 billion
[03:27:53.520 --> 03:27:59.200]  people are infested with intestinal parasites and worms so the problem that
[03:27:59.200 --> 03:28:04.920]  we found is if you with cancer patients for example we found up over a trillion
[03:28:04.920 --> 03:28:11.480]  microorganisms harmful in each person's body we calculated that out and other
[03:28:11.480 --> 03:28:16.200]  scientists have as well well if you have a trillion harmful organisms in your
[03:28:16.200 --> 03:28:20.960]  body they all take your nutrients and feed off of you and then they have to go
[03:28:20.960 --> 03:28:24.880]  to the bathroom and that's where the real problem comes in first of all they
[03:28:24.880 --> 03:28:28.640]  take they steal all the good stuff from you and then second of all they process
[03:28:28.640 --> 03:28:31.800]  it and then they go to the bathroom inside your system we turn into portable
[03:28:31.800 --> 03:28:37.040]  porta-potties you do because they secrete formaldehyde isopropyl alcohol
[03:28:37.040 --> 03:28:43.920]  phenol very toxic substances that are also endocrine disrupting chemicals and
[03:28:43.920 --> 03:28:48.440]  alter the hormone levels in your body as well the statistics are clear nine out
[03:28:48.440 --> 03:28:52.960]  of ten people are infested with harmful organisms like parasites parasites to be

[03:33:15.600 --> 03:33:19.920]  we're gonna go to some of your calls here and you know when I said I wanted to
[03:33:19.920 --> 03:33:24.640]  open the phone lines they instantly lit up and pretty much everyone wants to
[03:33:24.640 --> 03:33:30.000]  talk about the PC the politically correct culture which in my opinion is
[03:33:30.000 --> 03:33:35.840]  one of the most sick cultures of domination and control that we've
[03:33:35.840 --> 03:33:40.840]  really ever experienced and it reminds me of this headline that I want to talk
[03:33:40.840 --> 03:33:47.200]  about Mizzou protesters segregate by race white students asked to leave black
[03:33:47.200 --> 03:33:52.120]  only healing space the focus groups were intended to create a quote black only
[03:33:52.120 --> 03:33:57.400]  healing space this is from daily caller in an ironic development to say the
[03:33:57.400 --> 03:34:01.560]  least protests protesters at the University of Missouri segregated
[03:34:01.560 --> 03:34:05.520]  themselves by race Wednesday night having white students leave a gathering
[03:34:05.520 --> 03:34:09.360]  in order to create a black only healing space supporters of the group
[03:34:09.360 --> 03:34:13.960]  concerned students 1950 which has spearheaded the protest movement at MU
[03:34:13.960 --> 03:34:17.880]  assembled at the school's students that are Wednesday night for a meeting after
[03:34:17.880 --> 03:34:22.280]  a planned protest march was canceled due to bad weather according to an activist
[03:34:22.280 --> 03:34:26.000]  the white students were asked to leave and there's photos of them in their
[03:34:26.000 --> 03:34:30.920]  black only healing space now you don't have to have me tell you that this is
[03:34:30.920 --> 03:34:37.920]  racist obviously this is true segregation this is reducing our human
[03:34:37.920 --> 03:34:44.600]  consciousness to the lowest common denominator it is pure mental illness
[03:34:44.600 --> 03:34:49.800]  that is promoted by some politically correct so-called politically correct
[03:34:49.800 --> 03:34:54.120]  proponents and you know I've already offered the solution to fix the
[03:34:54.120 --> 03:34:58.240]  politically correct culture I have the solution if we would just listen it
[03:34:58.240 --> 03:35:03.240]  would be fixed tomorrow and that is that every single one of us needs to go back
[03:35:03.240 --> 03:35:11.560]  to kindergarten and learn the most basic levels of human functioning human
[03:35:11.560 --> 03:35:18.920]  empathy human morals just just the most basic stuff right maybe we shouldn't
[03:35:18.920 --> 03:35:23.960]  judge each other by the color of our skin even when they feel like others
[03:35:23.960 --> 03:35:27.120]  are judging them maybe they shouldn't judge others by the color of their skin
[03:35:27.120 --> 03:35:32.720]  by having a black only healing space when does it end the answer is it does
[03:35:32.720 --> 03:35:38.360]  not because political correctness has now been used as a tool of control and
[03:35:38.360 --> 03:35:43.280]  once people that have never had control before or any form of power get a little
[03:35:43.280 --> 03:35:48.280]  taste they like to go over and over and over again and get addicted to that form
[03:35:48.280 --> 03:35:52.960]  of power and I'll give you an example on how this power works to the night I was
[03:35:52.960 --> 03:36:00.200]  out to dinner and I make jokes right I make funny sarcastic jokes and I had
[03:36:00.200 --> 03:36:06.600]  made a joke about pig or something like that some some animal and and this girl
[03:36:06.600 --> 03:36:11.200]  said how dare you make a joke about animal cruelty now let's be clear I
[03:36:11.200 --> 03:36:15.320]  love animals I actually support nonprofits that help animals and help
[03:36:15.320 --> 03:36:19.680]  them not be slaughtered and killed pets like dogs and cats and things I'm a
[03:36:19.680 --> 03:36:23.200]  huge animal welfare proponent in the right reasonable ways right but this
[03:36:23.200 --> 03:36:28.200]  woman literally started tearing up how dare you make an animal cruelty joke you
[03:36:28.200 --> 03:36:32.680]  are in your evil you know how dare you I said something like slaughtered like a
[03:36:32.680 --> 03:36:38.720]  pig or something and she was physically crying tearing up and what happened in
[03:36:38.720 --> 03:36:43.320]  that moment was everyone around me then looked at her and looked at me because
[03:36:43.320 --> 03:36:48.200]  she would overreact to something like that she now how she thought she had
[03:36:48.200 --> 03:36:51.880]  power in the interaction just like political correctness let's say you
[03:36:51.880 --> 03:36:54.080]  know I'm sitting around with a group of friends or you're sitting around with a
[03:36:54.080 --> 03:36:57.560]  group of friends and you make a joke and it's not racist at all but they say oh
[03:36:57.560 --> 03:37:03.880]  my goodness that is racist sir that is racist it is racist to do anything that
[03:37:03.880 --> 03:37:08.040]  gives them if you're if you're weak enough to go for it a form of control
[03:37:08.040 --> 03:37:12.200]  and power over you that they would have never had I mean look at some of the
[03:37:12.200 --> 03:37:17.120]  the largest celebrities out there what brings them to their knees
[03:37:17.120 --> 03:37:24.200]  accusations of racism it is one of the most powerful lobbying tools that weak
[03:37:24.200 --> 03:37:28.560]  people have in this world not that there isn't real racism racism out there
[03:37:28.560 --> 03:37:33.840]  but mostly people don't care about that it's the implication of racism and then
[03:37:33.840 --> 03:37:37.880]  what would what would usually happen in interaction where someone accuses me of
[03:37:37.880 --> 03:37:41.280]  going against the politically correct agenda right if I was an average person
[03:37:41.280 --> 03:37:46.000]  I was they I'm so sorry I didn't mean to make that joke please forgive me and
[03:37:46.000 --> 03:37:51.520]  then I'm on my knees as the samurai takes his sword to my neck right please
[03:37:51.520 --> 03:37:57.040]  forgive me I'll do anything and then they have complete control over me and they
[03:37:57.040 --> 03:38:02.040]  can make me do whatever I want but instead knowing the politically correct
[03:38:02.040 --> 03:38:05.480]  system you say no that's absolutely ridiculous that I'm sorry that was
[03:38:05.480 --> 03:38:09.640]  offensive to you but it was not racist it was not over the line whatsoever you
[03:38:09.640 --> 03:38:14.000]  know get a sense of humor or you know grow some some some type of a spine you
[03:38:14.000 --> 03:38:18.200]  don't need to take your power from me using the politically correct dogmatic
[03:38:18.200 --> 03:38:22.680]  BS and when you do that they freak out and they don't know what to do but they
[03:38:22.680 --> 03:38:25.960]  will try to control you with the PC agenda over and over and over again and
[03:38:25.960 --> 03:38:30.040]  that's how the media tries to control the narrative let's talk to some people
[03:38:30.040 --> 03:38:33.120]  about this let's go to Steve in Virginia he wants to talk about the PC
[03:38:33.120 --> 03:38:38.880]  culture Steve what's on your mind hey Anthony first-time caller do I sound
[03:38:38.880 --> 03:38:43.960]  alright you sound great in correct congratulations as well all right well
[03:38:43.960 --> 03:38:49.440]  I'm 21 living in Virginia now I grew up here I wanted to give you my political
[03:38:49.440 --> 03:38:56.960]  correctness story about what I was in Ohio I just graduated from a university
[03:38:56.960 --> 03:39:02.480]  in Northwestern Ohio where you go to be a mechanic but if you want a actual
[03:39:02.480 --> 03:39:08.760]  college degree you have to take propaganda classes and particularly the
[03:39:08.760 --> 03:39:14.840]  one I'm focusing on is diversity and organizations you know first I just like
[03:39:14.840 --> 03:39:19.480]  to say I agree I agree with Alex's views on political correctness the super
[03:39:19.480 --> 03:39:24.040]  imposed mental illness and it teaches people to look for what could
[03:39:24.040 --> 03:39:29.360]  hypothetically be racist not any actual problems but yeah it helps people get
[03:39:29.360 --> 03:39:33.200]  offended by things that should not offend them in any way it creates issues
[03:39:33.200 --> 03:39:37.360]  out of nothing and creates turmoil among friends family and complete strangers
[03:39:37.360 --> 03:39:41.880]  when there should not be any whatsoever but anyway sorry go ahead yeah that's
[03:39:41.880 --> 03:39:48.360]  when you teach you talk about current issues in that class but everything is
[03:39:48.360 --> 03:39:55.040]  boiled down to race sex age you know where you're from all that and you know
[03:39:55.040 --> 03:39:58.080]  all the numbers are cooked they just want you to get into thinking about
[03:39:58.080 --> 03:40:05.760]  everything you know along the lines of race or sex or whatever and you know the
[03:40:05.760 --> 03:40:10.640]  teacher who taught it was a former juvenile prosecutor you know a portly
[03:40:10.640 --> 03:40:19.000]  white woman with all the politically correct views and you know it so what
[03:40:19.000 --> 03:40:21.840]  happened in the class what what is it what is it that stuck with you that
[03:40:21.840 --> 03:40:27.920]  happened in this class well this is what stuck in a town of about 40,000 most
[03:40:27.920 --> 03:40:32.400]  the people are white most people at the college are white it's not a melting pot
[03:40:32.400 --> 03:40:39.680]  there it's in Ohio a class with 30 students one of them a black guy the
[03:40:39.680 --> 03:40:45.360]  rest of them are all white one of them one of them's a woman and she started
[03:40:45.360 --> 03:40:50.400]  telling us about white privilege and how we're all inherently better off or well
[03:40:50.400 --> 03:40:56.160]  to do be just because we're white and you know there are some successes out
[03:40:56.160 --> 03:41:00.840]  there we weren't gonna buy it we're all we are all in that together and we're
[03:41:00.840 --> 03:41:05.440]  all broke and pretty much the entire class is white being told that we're
[03:41:05.440 --> 03:41:10.440]  inherently better off because I'll tell you what's racist is the idea of white
[03:41:10.440 --> 03:41:16.160]  privilege is racist because it's acting like it is the most offensive thing my
[03:41:16.160 --> 03:41:20.040]  black friends agree this is the most offensive thing the black people to act
[03:41:20.040 --> 03:41:23.920]  like the white privilege thing is something we need to talk about like I
[03:41:23.920 --> 03:41:28.200]  mean just just listen to the arrogance of these statements well as a white
[03:41:28.200 --> 03:41:32.640]  person you're just better off and most likely to be more successful quite
[03:41:32.640 --> 03:41:37.240]  frankly you should understand that black people cannot be as successful as you
[03:41:37.240 --> 03:41:42.840]  on average because you are a white what that is racist come on we all have an
[03:41:42.840 --> 03:41:46.680]  equal playing field of course there's episodes of racism and discrimination
[03:41:46.680 --> 03:41:50.200]  that exists but to go ahead and bring it to the forefront oh hello you are
[03:41:50.200 --> 03:41:54.160]  born into this world by the way you do not have a privilege you see this white
[03:41:54.160 --> 03:41:57.360]  child over there will most likely be more successful than you that's the most
[03:41:57.360 --> 03:42:01.800]  racist crap I've ever heard in my entire life how about forget everything else
[03:42:01.800 --> 03:42:05.200]  you are on the same playing field you have the ability to dominate as much as
[03:42:05.200 --> 03:42:08.800]  you want you can help as many people as you want I don't think there's white
[03:42:08.800 --> 03:42:12.600]  privilege involved with uploading a video to YouTube and getting 20 million
[03:42:12.600 --> 03:42:17.600]  views it's just it's ridiculous it's stupid I'll tell you what there is there
[03:42:17.600 --> 03:42:24.880]  is a system that conforms us to this one idea this mono concept of success which
[03:42:24.880 --> 03:42:29.800]  is go to school go to college get a career you know make X amount of money
[03:42:29.800 --> 03:42:33.640]  per year and there's discrimination in that workforce blah blah blah blah they
[03:42:33.640 --> 03:42:38.800]  all fail to understand that we don't start it's life is not a linear is it's
[03:42:38.800 --> 03:42:42.560]  not a one line with starting point in the end we all have different purposes in
[03:42:42.560 --> 03:42:46.880]  our lives and start with different skills and traits and understandings and
[03:42:46.880 --> 03:42:51.400]  some of us maybe not the highest academic understanding which is almost
[03:42:51.400 --> 03:42:55.440]  worthless in many cases anyway sure it can build space shuttles and everything
[03:42:55.440 --> 03:42:59.880]  like that which is amazing but some of us you know some some people out there
[03:42:59.880 --> 03:43:04.240]  don't have specialties in that area maybe they're an amazing painter or maybe
[03:43:04.240 --> 03:43:09.520]  they're a musician this idea of privilege also comes from this this this
[03:43:09.520 --> 03:43:15.320]  failed concept of a linear trans discussion in life where we all must do
[03:43:15.320 --> 03:43:19.840]  the same thing and go to college and if you offend anyone you are bad and you
[03:43:19.840 --> 03:43:24.160]  abide by the system and the system makes your rules and that's how it controls
[03:43:24.160 --> 03:43:27.720]  you but I'm not in the system I'm escaping the system I'm done with the
[03:43:27.720 --> 03:43:31.920]  system and that's how we get past political correctness let's talk to
[03:43:31.920 --> 03:43:36.200]  stigma thank you for your call Steve in Florida on the PC culture as well what's
[03:43:36.200 --> 03:43:41.480]  on your mind well listen I've got actually a lot of experience in this I've
[03:43:41.480 --> 03:43:45.840]  been fighting these guys since 82 back in the Gorbachev days when things out
[03:43:45.840 --> 03:43:52.920]  thing was was in China the Canadian socialists and the CND which is the
[03:43:52.920 --> 03:43:57.120]  Center for Nuclear Disarmament and no World Zionist Congress they would almost
[03:43:57.120 --> 03:44:00.960]  every weekend either in Windsor or Lansing or Ann Arbor I'm from Michigan
[03:44:00.960 --> 03:44:05.280]  originally they would all you know meet there to do their thing and we would show
[03:44:05.280 --> 03:44:08.760]  up and unfortunately Alex compared you know what what they're doing to the
[03:44:08.760 --> 03:44:13.720]  brown shirts but there's the same tactics what you would show up there to
[03:44:13.720 --> 03:44:16.920]  announce their message and protest against them and they would any
[03:44:16.920 --> 03:44:22.640]  instantly start screaming Nazi racist KKK immediately and then everybody's down
[03:44:22.640 --> 03:44:26.480]  on you and then the cops are trying to drag you out so the best way to do it
[03:44:26.480 --> 03:44:30.360]  is just like the brown shirts just roll up get out do your thing and it's done
[03:44:30.360 --> 03:44:35.000]  I'm telling you it wasn't two months and those rallies went from about I don't
[03:44:35.000 --> 03:44:39.480]  know 2,500 people down to three or 400 you know violence isn't really
[03:44:39.480 --> 03:44:43.360]  acceptable today I understand that I'm not advocating it but it is a tool in
[03:44:43.360 --> 03:44:48.000]  your toolbox I mean well you know I'm not advocating any form of violence and
[03:44:48.000 --> 03:44:51.400]  I will say there is a boiling point that is going to be reached with the PC
[03:44:51.400 --> 03:44:56.360]  agenda though because not in the form of violence but in the form of ideological
[03:44:56.360 --> 03:45:01.880]  wildfire because you have headlines like this one fourth grader threatened with
[03:45:01.880 --> 03:45:07.520]  sexual harassment for writing love letter psychologists said kids need to be
[03:45:07.520 --> 03:45:14.720]  educated about boundaries basically this kid went in and gave this girl he's in
[03:45:14.720 --> 03:45:19.960]  fourth grade a nine-year-old child gave this girl a little love note and it
[03:45:19.960 --> 03:45:26.440]  says you know your eyes sparkle like diamonds you're pretty and I like you
[03:45:26.440 --> 03:45:34.160]  oh my god right gave this girl a love letter and it's cute oh I like you your
[03:45:34.160 --> 03:45:38.440]  eyes sparkle like diamonds you're really pretty what fourth grade girl wouldn't
[03:45:38.440 --> 03:45:44.600]  want to get that well he was reported to the principal for potentially sexual
[03:45:44.600 --> 03:45:50.200]  harassment a love letter from a fourth grader but okay that's crazy enough and
[03:45:50.200 --> 03:45:54.520]  you think well that's just a crazy incident you know they're too PC it
[03:45:54.520 --> 03:45:57.880]  sounds like South Park actually maybe maybe if you've seen the South Park
[03:45:57.880 --> 03:46:02.080]  episode about political correctness maybe the PC principal actually works at
[03:46:02.080 --> 03:46:06.800]  this school the PC principal might actually be the one at this school but
[03:46:06.800 --> 03:46:11.560]  he says that the nine-year-old might be guilty of sexually harassing the girl
[03:46:11.560 --> 03:46:17.360]  and then one of the psychologists said yeah you need to teach your son
[03:46:17.360 --> 03:46:21.640]  boundaries and if it happens again you might be charged with sexual harassment
[03:46:21.640 --> 03:46:27.440]  this is mental illness Melissa Harris Perry if that's how you say her name is
[03:46:27.440 --> 03:46:32.040]  also mentally ill when she said being a hard worker is racist because someone
[03:46:32.040 --> 03:46:36.040]  on her program said you know Marco Rubio nothing not even about him by the
[03:46:36.040 --> 03:46:39.840]  way there's a hard worker and she goes well you need to think about that
[03:46:39.840 --> 03:46:43.640]  statement because only slaves that picked cottons were hard worker what
[03:46:43.640 --> 03:46:47.360]  what do you what was that even mean this is just complete mental illness it's
[03:46:47.360 --> 03:46:50.880]  like a it's like latching on anything that could give them value because
[03:46:50.880 --> 03:46:54.560]  they're just value leaching losers all these people that obsessed about the PC
[03:46:54.560 --> 03:46:58.360]  cultures are complete losers unfortunately and it's sad it's sad it's
[03:46:58.360 --> 03:47:02.160]  really really sad but they're complete losers with no value in their life and
[03:47:02.160 --> 03:47:06.240]  they can't actually embody passion to help other people like I'm in passion
[03:47:06.240 --> 03:47:08.880]  right now because I want to end this and I actually want to help other people
[03:47:08.880 --> 03:47:12.520]  and get past the BS that no one cares about anymore this stupid PC culture
[03:47:12.520 --> 03:47:17.080]  actually get on to helping people and enhancing their lives and overcoming
[03:47:17.080 --> 03:47:21.680]  their issues and taking back their country and getting rid of the corrupt
[03:47:21.680 --> 03:47:25.960]  bankers that ruin them and completely loot all everything and the payday loan
[03:47:25.960 --> 03:47:29.960]  centers that make billions of dollars and I've told you stories where some
[03:47:29.960 --> 03:47:33.720]  people the executives from there are throwing $300,000 down on the blackjack
[03:47:33.720 --> 03:47:37.920]  table or roulette or whatever it was losing it all not caring that's the
[03:47:37.920 --> 03:47:40.720]  kind of stuff we should care about but these people see they don't care about
[03:47:40.720 --> 03:47:44.000]  any of that because they don't have passion in their hearts for the human
[03:47:44.000 --> 03:47:50.760]  spirit instead they want to feel some type of passion so they latch on to this
[03:47:50.760 --> 03:47:56.080]  ideology of political correctness like Melissa Harris Perry you are racist and
[03:47:56.080 --> 03:48:00.400]  this child this child needs to learn about boundaries he's not allowed to
[03:48:00.400 --> 03:48:04.080]  speak to another human being it's going to get to the point where you're not
[03:48:04.080 --> 03:48:07.120]  even allowed to speak to another human being or it's not politically correct
[03:48:07.120 --> 03:48:10.120]  because you need to respect their boundaries it could be it could be a
[03:48:10.120 --> 03:48:13.240]  trigger warning for you to speak to these people you need to there's a
[03:48:13.240 --> 03:48:16.880]  circle there's a circle of boundaries around you and if you speak to another
[03:48:16.880 --> 03:48:22.720]  person oh my god you just might be sentenced to death but to be serious for
[03:48:22.720 --> 03:48:27.280]  a second what's happening is with these we stupid headlines force-creator
[03:48:27.280 --> 03:48:32.160]  threatened sexual harassment fretting love letter stupid stupid events that
[03:48:32.160 --> 03:48:36.440]  we have to cover is there's going to be a boiling point where people are sick of
[03:48:36.440 --> 03:48:38.760]  it and they're sick of it right now but I mean they're going to be really sick of
[03:48:38.760 --> 03:48:43.880]  it and it's going to kind of turn to the point where about one percent of
[03:48:43.880 --> 03:48:48.720]  people actually still believe in the PC reality and shows like South Park are
[03:48:48.720 --> 03:48:53.240]  helping crumble this by the way doing a great job showing the ridiculousness of
[03:48:53.240 --> 03:48:57.520]  political correctness it's already pretty low I think it's a small minority that
[03:48:57.520 --> 03:49:02.920]  really really cling to these PC ideologies but then in due time there
[03:49:02.920 --> 03:49:07.720]  will be the opposition to political correctness that completely wipes it out
[03:49:07.720 --> 03:49:10.720]  I don't mean violently or anything like that I don't mean a war I just mean
[03:49:10.720 --> 03:49:15.800]  people will ideologically be diametrically opposed to it and it will
[03:49:15.800 --> 03:49:19.800]  cease to have any form of control in the media because if the media clings to
[03:49:19.800 --> 03:49:22.960]  it they will just completely lose their viewership as they already are but I mean
[03:49:22.960 --> 03:49:28.400]  they will die let's talk to one more caller on PC culture sherry in closing
[03:49:28.400 --> 03:49:36.640]  what are your views well I think it's important to correlate that how the
[03:49:36.640 --> 03:49:42.360]  children are acting on college campuses there's a first generation to graduate
[03:49:42.360 --> 03:49:49.880]  from head start where the children are given over to public education at the
[03:49:49.880 --> 03:49:55.880]  age of three or four yeah that's a good point as well so what she's saying is
[03:49:55.880 --> 03:50:00.200]  you know what's happening in Missouri the children are entered into school
[03:50:00.200 --> 03:50:05.160]  programs in earlier age and obviously the system protocols are set up to teach
[03:50:05.160 --> 03:50:09.520]  you know PC culture and all that kind of stuff now what's interesting to me is
[03:50:09.520 --> 03:50:12.600]  that I hope that we don't lose focus I mean I'm a pretty young person myself
[03:50:12.600 --> 03:50:18.400]  from the so-called newer generations right but the reality is it's not about
[03:50:18.400 --> 03:50:22.520]  the age it's not about the generations it's about some people buying into the
[03:50:22.520 --> 03:50:26.280]  system and thinking it gives them power and some people realizing it doesn't and
[03:50:26.280 --> 03:50:31.080]  my job everyone's job is to help them realize the system does not give them
[03:50:31.080 --> 03:50:34.320]  power they give themselves power and they have the power within themselves to
[03:50:34.320 --> 03:50:38.200]  do whatever it is they want to do not by biting into the PC culture you're not
[03:50:38.200 --> 03:50:42.000]  part of a gang you're not part of a cool system you're being played I'm Anthony

[03:54:13.160 --> 03:54:17.800]  Rob do who's going to be hosting the nightly news on info wars tonight and
[03:54:17.800 --> 03:54:21.320]  he's gonna give us a preview as well we're gonna take some more of your phone
[03:54:21.320 --> 03:54:25.160]  calls probably one or two more before the end of the show and Alex will be
[03:54:25.160 --> 03:54:29.360]  back tomorrow from 11 a.m. the 2 p.m. Central but Rob what is coming up
[03:54:29.360 --> 03:54:33.560]  tonight you're hosting info wars nightly news that's right and I don't do it a
[03:54:33.560 --> 03:54:37.280]  lot but every once in a while you know I need to step in and get stuff done we
[03:54:37.280 --> 03:54:40.520]  sent Jakari to Missouri to see what's going on there and they're coming they
[03:54:40.520 --> 03:54:43.920]  actually came back last night they have a report that they'll be will be
[03:54:43.920 --> 03:54:48.560]  premiering on the nightly news and it will feature I guess Kit Daniel made a
[03:54:48.560 --> 03:54:52.840]  prediction in a report saying it's some probably some 19-year-old kid who called
[03:54:52.840 --> 03:54:58.080]  in this KKK threat at the campus turns out he was exactly right he called it
[03:54:58.080 --> 03:55:01.720]  even to the age he got it right so that's when you look at this stuff long
[03:55:01.720 --> 03:55:05.280]  enough you can really see the patterns developing and also I'm gonna have a two
[03:55:05.280 --> 03:55:13.080]  part interview with Dr. Enrico Ettinger from N I a k r b dot de they're kind of
[03:55:13.080 --> 03:55:17.240]  a they kind of combined holistic medicine with studying what the Russians
[03:55:17.240 --> 03:55:21.720]  did with health by sending people out into space the rocket they call it space
[03:55:21.720 --> 03:55:25.720]  medicine and how they were looking at the human body and the voltages coming
[03:55:25.720 --> 03:55:29.400]  out of the body for different things and just designing medical protocols to
[03:55:29.400 --> 03:55:33.000]  help people go out into space and come back and not be you know when they cart
[03:55:33.000 --> 03:55:36.360]  our astronauts off they eat after they go ahead and in space they bring them out
[03:55:36.360 --> 03:55:39.680]  and stretchers because they can't walk well Russian astronauts would come off
[03:55:39.680 --> 03:55:44.960]  of these missions and do handstands okay so he took those and kind of combined
[03:55:44.960 --> 03:55:47.160]  with some other things we'll see if this is an interesting interview or not it's
[03:55:47.160 --> 03:55:50.320]  gonna be a two-parter and we're gonna have a translator on it so who knows
[03:55:50.320 --> 03:55:52.920]  what it's gonna be so tune in tonight should be some really interesting
[03:55:52.920 --> 03:55:56.360]  information definitely interesting you were explaining to me and I think there
[03:55:56.360 --> 03:56:00.920]  is a lot of powerful science behind the Russian experiments with the space
[03:56:00.920 --> 03:56:03.680]  technologies everything like that interesting crossover and we lost that
[03:56:03.680 --> 03:56:06.120]  information because we never want to deal with the Russians or talk to them or
[03:56:06.120 --> 03:56:09.640]  anything so exactly well let's hit one more caller let's go to Susan and
[03:56:09.640 --> 03:56:18.040]  Georgia what's on your mind Susan hello hey hey hey yeah I just wanted to say a
[03:56:18.040 --> 03:56:23.520]  couple things about this all this talk about political correctness all this
[03:56:23.520 --> 03:56:28.640]  going overboard about things and it's just taking up so much of our time and
[03:56:28.640 --> 03:56:34.120]  attention when you know we just we just got to be careful not to let it just
[03:56:34.120 --> 03:56:39.680]  absorb you know hours of our time discussing it I think really because
[03:56:39.680 --> 03:56:43.480]  there's so many other things we should be talking and that's probably part of
[03:56:43.480 --> 03:56:49.400]  they you know whoever they is their plan you know just to get people looking at
[03:56:49.400 --> 03:56:53.480]  these little issues that are pretty much non-issues you know and to get us so
[03:56:53.480 --> 03:56:58.080]  we're not taking time to talk about the things that are really important yeah
[03:56:58.080 --> 03:57:01.160]  there's your distractions it's like if a thief is trying to break in your house
[03:57:01.160 --> 03:57:05.160]  from your main door entry right and he has a little soda can he throws it in
[03:57:05.160 --> 03:57:08.120]  your backyard so it sounds like someone's in your backyard so you go around
[03:57:08.120 --> 03:57:12.240]  the backyard to look and the thief gets through the door they're passing TPP
[03:57:12.240 --> 03:57:18.480]  right now they are doing the CISA the internet it's literally like office space
[03:57:18.480 --> 03:57:22.880]  is literally a TPS cover sheet mental illness culture where they're running
[03:57:22.880 --> 03:57:25.520]  around saying you're not saying this right you need to put this and they're
[03:57:25.520 --> 03:57:29.680]  saying it list and that everybody's obsessing about the proper protocols and
[03:57:29.680 --> 03:57:33.920]  how to say things instead of just being real that's the problem it is true but
[03:57:33.920 --> 03:57:36.760]  it's such a distraction oh it's a bit of distraction such a distraction from
[03:57:36.760 --> 03:57:40.120]  everything that's powerful and amazing and important in life people can't even
[03:57:40.120 --> 03:57:43.600]  introspectively look at themselves anymore they can't do anything because
[03:57:43.600 --> 03:57:47.680]  of the PC culture and one thing I don't like about the PC culture too is it
[03:57:47.680 --> 03:57:50.920]  teaches that it's okay to have all these negative qualities like oh that's just
[03:57:50.920 --> 03:57:54.600]  who you are you're just born that way like someone's all grumpy and mean and
[03:57:54.600 --> 03:57:57.000]  calling people names and being negative it's like hey that's just their
[03:57:57.000 --> 03:58:00.920]  personality man and and talking in a list but the only way to get your point
[03:58:00.920 --> 03:58:05.080]  across right I mean so you can't you can't even criticize people in good ways
[03:58:05.080 --> 03:58:09.560]  anymore to help them it's like this PC bro anyway I'm Anthony Gutiarty with Rob
