[00:00.000 --> 00:20.960]  Live from Austin, Texas, in the heart of the Resistance, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio
[00:20.960 --> 00:32.640]  Network. All right folks, we have Joel Scalzen joining us to talk geopolitics at the bottom
[00:32.640 --> 00:38.960]  of the hour. He is a former Marine Corps officer, naval aviator, best-selling author, patriot,
[00:39.920 --> 00:44.480]  you know, head of one of the only major conservative groups that ever tried to take the country back.
[00:44.480 --> 00:52.480]  He's a big fish, but Cleon Scalzen, his uncle, was a high-level FBI section chief, and the guy
[00:52.480 --> 00:57.200]  that was advising Joe McCarthy and everything, and he was dead on target, but it just was bigger
[00:57.200 --> 01:03.200]  than he even thought. He's going to join us today, and I meant to cover this Friday, and I didn't
[01:03.200 --> 01:08.880]  even click that I was getting Joel on today, the 45 goals of communism that got read out in Congress
[01:08.880 --> 01:14.400]  in 1963. Maybe we should spend some time on that, at least mentioning it, and then get Joel back up
[01:15.200 --> 01:22.960]  for a full show. Because again, communism is just the ideology of globalist control. Who is behind
[01:22.960 --> 01:34.080]  it? Why do the Jeff Bezos' and why do the Barack Obama's of the world and the Virgin Atlantic owner,
[01:34.080 --> 01:39.360]  why do they support it? Well, it's a video we've got coming up that I played twice on Friday,
[01:40.160 --> 01:42.800]  not for lack of content. I'm going to play it again today.
[01:44.640 --> 01:51.600]  A woman in a sailor outfit at South by Southwest a month ago was some lady interning as a reporter
[01:51.600 --> 02:00.000]  for us, and the media is holding this up like she is God, and they say that we were destroyed by
[02:00.000 --> 02:05.280]  this video, that we removed it because it destroyed us. No, it was uploaded on multiple channels,
[02:05.280 --> 02:10.560]  and I said, stop duplicating and stop flooding the channels. I said, I looked at like 30, 40
[02:11.120 --> 02:17.040]  videos, and I said, knock those out. They went, really, they're already going viral, sir. And I
[02:17.040 --> 02:22.800]  went, I told you, just put them on sub channels, please. That's the exact conversation. But then
[02:22.800 --> 02:27.040]  they went, oh, Jones is scared of this. No, I'm going to probably air this a few thousand times.
[02:27.040 --> 02:31.680]  I'm definitely not scared of it in the way you think. I'm scared of it in
[02:32.880 --> 02:38.400]  that it all crystallized when I watched this video. So that's coming up. And then Roger Stone,
[02:40.160 --> 02:47.600]  I called Roger on Friday. And I said, Roger, they're saying they've got a mole inside the
[02:48.240 --> 02:54.880]  Trump administration for Russia. He said, hold on. And I went, no, no, no, no, not
[02:54.880 --> 03:00.640]  that. Just seeing I'm an idiot, you're going to say, hold on. That's like saying they sued 13
[03:00.640 --> 03:05.120]  Russians. And then when Mueller shows up at the court case, the Russians show up and he drops the
[03:05.120 --> 03:12.160]  case or tries to delay it. I get it's like saying, I'm suing Casper, the friendly ghost.
[03:13.920 --> 03:18.160]  And he goes, well, no, exactly. It's exactly. It's just like they're saying they're suing
[03:18.160 --> 03:22.320]  all these Russians are suing us or suing me or suing him. And when you have to show up,
[03:22.320 --> 03:27.120]  they crap their pants because there's nothing there. It's just, it's just, it's hot air.
[03:28.800 --> 03:32.800]  And he said, no, that's exactly what it is. But he goes, Alex, I told you a year ago
[03:32.800 --> 03:39.280]  who the mole is. And he told me and I went and I looked it up. And again, by the mole,
[03:40.000 --> 03:48.160]  this is the guy involved with past Republican administrations that contacted a bunch of junior
[03:48.160 --> 03:53.520]  campaign staffers that would say, Hey, come to London. I'm going to have you write a paper
[03:53.520 --> 03:56.960]  for three grand, pay your first class, bring your wife, nice hotel.
[04:00.080 --> 04:05.920]  And then that individual would then try to say that they said there were Russian contacts.
[04:07.440 --> 04:16.720]  So we're going to expose the fake mole of Mueller coming up in the last couple of segments of the
[04:16.720 --> 04:22.880]  second hour. So you got that coming up exclusively. Just like I told you, North Korea wants electricity
[04:22.880 --> 04:27.200]  nationwide. I told you back on March 8th, and they would already agree to give up their nukes.
[04:28.480 --> 04:32.720]  They had a certain number and the deal was made because they're being cut out from China
[04:33.680 --> 04:37.680]  to actually have economic development and they're being checkmated. They can see what
[04:37.680 --> 04:42.480]  South Korea has done and China's flipping out. Cutting away North Korea from China is a stroke
[04:42.480 --> 04:48.320]  of genius. Give Pompeo and Trump can do it. And again, I can't believe how blessed I am. Seriously.
[04:49.680 --> 04:53.840]  That I was given this intel before anyone else, but they said,
[04:53.840 --> 04:56.400]  we're doing it, Alex, as we know you're under attack. Wow.
[04:59.520 --> 05:05.920]  I'm so excited. The new product at m4warslife.com in a glass bottle, two month servings filled
[05:05.920 --> 05:12.800]  to the brim, filled to the absolute top, the real red pill. This is a heart and brain pill,
[05:13.440 --> 05:17.760]  a new tropic, but it doesn't have any stimulants in it. But boy, does it stimulate
[05:17.760 --> 05:23.280]  because it's beyond that. Quite frankly, I just went off what I saw medical doctors
[05:23.840 --> 05:27.840]  prescribing to their patients, but it wasn't prescription, but they were charging people
[05:27.840 --> 05:34.080]  $100, $200 for the formulae. And I came up with our own formula, working with some scientists
[05:34.080 --> 05:41.280]  and developers, non GMO made right here in America, 120 capsules. And ladies and gentlemen,
[05:41.280 --> 05:46.320]  you add the preglinone to it, which is the precursor to all the hormones that your body
[05:46.320 --> 05:53.760]  has to have to even make the hormones in your glands. It is amazing. Red pill now available
[05:53.760 --> 06:09.680]  at m4warsstore.com. And your purchase fugs the operation.
[06:14.960 --> 06:21.120]  We now take you live to the central Texas command center and the heart of the resistance.
[06:21.120 --> 06:34.880]  Well, let me tell you right now, I'm very, very excited to be involved in the info war.
[06:35.600 --> 06:43.520]  I'm very, very excited to be involved in the fight. But I've got a major apology to make
[06:43.520 --> 06:48.240]  right up here at the front of the broadcast because when I'm wrong, I have to make an apology
[06:48.240 --> 06:54.560]  right up front because integrity is the only thing I've got. I only make maybe one or two
[06:54.560 --> 07:00.000]  apologies a year. I make retractions or corrections all the time. We cover thousands of new stories
[07:00.000 --> 07:04.640]  a week. So maybe once a week there's a retraction. I've been saying for a couple of months, why
[07:04.640 --> 07:09.360]  is the New York observer attacking Donald Trump saying he's a Russian agent with no evidence?
[07:09.360 --> 07:17.040]  And then he owns the trust, but he still owns the New York observer. And then one of my crew
[07:17.040 --> 07:22.000]  walked in and dropped right in my face, an article out of New York from a year ago
[07:23.200 --> 07:26.560]  that Jared Kushner no longer owns the New York observer.
[07:29.200 --> 07:32.960]  Boy, did I feel like an idiot. I'm like, man, I read hundreds of articles a day.
[07:32.960 --> 07:40.000]  I scan hundreds more. I didn't know. I'm like, man, what is Kushner doing? Because it's like
[07:40.000 --> 07:46.320]  the New York observer is like the worst deceptive rag. He sold it for 15 million. How about they
[07:46.320 --> 07:53.280]  like negative 15 million? What a piece of crap. So the Hollywood Reporter reported on all that
[07:54.960 --> 08:03.360]  a year ago. Okay. They reported on again a few months ago. When I'm wrong, I'm going to tell
[08:03.360 --> 08:07.920]  you I'm wrong because all I've got is my credibility. If I'm saying something, I really believe it.
[08:07.920 --> 08:19.600]  Now, I started talking about an apology I was going to make and I remember what it was,
[08:19.600 --> 08:22.560]  but then I remember, I don't remember the gist of what it was going to be. So I have to do it
[08:22.560 --> 08:28.000]  later in the hour. I'm not doing that as a cliffhanger. I just was, I had all these topics and
[08:28.000 --> 08:33.680]  that so many times I go live on air and then I have a particular thing I'm going to say,
[08:33.680 --> 08:37.440]  but then I go, no, I'm going to do this. And then I start talking about the next apology I've got to
[08:37.440 --> 08:44.080]  make, which are rare. And then I remember what it was about, but I can't do it properly now because
[08:44.080 --> 08:48.880]  it's not heartfelt. And I had this essence, this essence of what I was going to apologize about.
[08:48.880 --> 08:53.920]  So I'm sure during a break or something, hopefully I'll remember what it was because I remember the
[08:53.920 --> 09:02.880]  apology, but I don't remember why it clicked I was wrong. That is so frustrating. That is beyond
[09:02.880 --> 09:11.840]  frustrating. That is maddening. But that was one I kind of halfway backed off of last week. And then
[09:11.840 --> 09:18.000]  this one, I remember what the retraction was, but why I decided to make it
[09:19.920 --> 09:24.240]  and the particulars of it, I'm going to have to sit here and sit back and think for a while.
[09:24.240 --> 09:34.240]  Those will give you a big headache, won't they? You know, I think I'm going to try
[09:34.240 --> 09:39.680]  to do this this way right now. Let's talk about who I'm not apologetic to.
[09:42.640 --> 09:46.960]  I'm not apologetic to Maxine Waters. You know,
[09:46.960 --> 09:57.520]  Thursday morning, Friday morning, whatever it was, I got up at 6am, went in, drank some coffee,
[09:59.200 --> 10:00.800]  had an espresso on top of it,
[10:04.320 --> 10:06.960]  fed the cats, fed the dog.
[10:06.960 --> 10:15.360]  And then I went in and woke the kids up to cook them breakfast.
[10:19.600 --> 10:26.240]  And I pulled back. And I was just thinking about how the whole world works and how all
[10:26.240 --> 10:34.880]  this stuff goes down. And I had an iPad, my wife's iPad, a fancy white case, props up nice,
[10:34.880 --> 10:41.120]  warm cooking eggs and bacon, packing their lunches. I don't do it every day, but I like
[10:41.120 --> 10:44.720]  to pack their lunches and cook breakfast at least a couple of times a week because it's fun.
[10:44.720 --> 10:49.120]  That's the kind of work I like. I like washing dishes, mowing the lawn, you know, stuff like,
[10:49.120 --> 10:54.400]  it's very relaxing. So I'm in there making little sandwiches and telling my kids to go eat their
[10:54.400 --> 11:02.960]  food before it gets cold. And I'm sitting back and I see an infoworks.com article at about
[11:02.960 --> 11:11.360]  seven o'clock go bloop. And it's like Maxine Waters says, I resent, this is in quotes,
[11:12.400 --> 11:15.840]  I resent make America great again.
[11:20.000 --> 11:26.160]  And I looked at that headline and it was like Gateway Pundit or something. And I clicked on it.
[11:26.160 --> 11:32.960]  I thought, I thought surely she didn't say that. Not like I'm looking to get her. I'm like, oh,
[11:32.960 --> 11:38.000]  I finally got Maxine Waters. Oh, no, I was like, okay, she didn't really say that.
[11:39.520 --> 11:46.000]  So I watched the four minute clip and I played it on the show that day. But later in the show,
[11:46.000 --> 11:50.240]  I said, wait a minute, maybe we play like a minute or so with the congressman from Pennsylvania,
[11:50.240 --> 11:56.480]  said the Republican. I thought maybe he said something bad. So during four different breaks,
[11:56.480 --> 11:59.600]  because I didn't just believe the crew, they're great people. I went and I watched
[12:00.480 --> 12:04.720]  the whole remarks on C-span, messing the whole show up. I get obsessed on stuff.
[12:04.720 --> 12:07.920]  There's all this stuff happening, sir. This person's calling this general's calling.
[12:07.920 --> 12:12.560]  We have a brain, I'm watching this to see. And the guy's like, we have to come together.
[12:12.560 --> 12:16.080]  And it's about economics. We all love each other. If you're all working on the floor of a
[12:16.080 --> 12:21.040]  factory, it doesn't matter what color you are, you're male or female. It's about, you know,
[12:21.040 --> 12:26.720]  building that car and you're on a team. And we have to transcend that. Because I had this feeling,
[12:26.720 --> 12:31.760]  I said, there's no way she flipped out so bad. He must have said something horrible. And I played
[12:31.760 --> 12:35.840]  like a minute of what he said, but I thought, let me be able to really go back. Because I said,
[12:35.840 --> 12:40.320]  I know she's crazy. She's out of control. She's corrupt. All these 50 something million to her
[12:40.320 --> 12:44.000]  husband and her bank. And, you know, she's the most corrupt member of Congress and gets away
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.880]  with it. She's a woman and because she's quote, has black skin or whatever. And so I watched
[12:48.880 --> 12:52.320]  from the beginning of the guy getting up, took me four breaks.
[12:54.880 --> 12:59.680]  That's four breaks of a syndicated talk show host watching, going, I hope he said something
[12:59.680 --> 13:06.560]  bad because I wanted to believe he did something wrong. And what he did was be loving and say,
[13:06.560 --> 13:10.800]  we should work together. So I later played the whole clip in the third hour of the show. I said,
[13:10.800 --> 13:18.240]  it's not that she's black. We need to bill black people up or anybody else. It's that she is spewing
[13:18.240 --> 13:24.480]  all this crap knowingly about you don't know how she's standing up to the white man when she works
[13:24.480 --> 13:32.720]  for the big multinationals that are screwing everybody over. And I couldn't believe that
[13:32.720 --> 13:38.080]  there wasn't something that God didn't do anything. I played the clip on Friday. I played the whole
[13:38.080 --> 13:50.560]  exchange. And she said, I resent make America great again. And that was the thing, man. People
[13:50.560 --> 13:55.440]  confront me and they go, we're ashamed of you. You know, blah, blah, blah. I used to be this good
[13:55.440 --> 14:00.800]  guy or whatever. It means nothing to me. I'm actually out for everybody. And I know this
[14:00.800 --> 14:04.640]  country's got its problems, but the idea is beautiful. And compared to other nations,
[14:04.640 --> 14:10.400]  it's powerful. And I'm not going to bow down in some virtue signal to her and go along with this.
[14:10.400 --> 14:15.200]  So, so, so let's play what she said at the end. You can go to see span. You can watch the whole
[14:15.200 --> 14:22.960]  thing from Thursday that we aired on Friday. But this is someone saying she resents make America
[14:22.960 --> 14:30.320]  great again. Here it is. However, I don't appreciate that you did not interrupt him when
[14:30.320 --> 14:35.920]  he was making those outrageous remarks about him knowing more about discrimination than I know
[14:35.920 --> 14:41.920]  about discrimination. I resent that. And I resent the remark about making America great again.
[14:41.920 --> 14:46.960]  He's down here making a speech for this dishonorable president of the United States of America,
[14:46.960 --> 14:53.520]  having said that I reserve the balance of my time. And no, I do not yield not one second to you.
[14:53.520 --> 15:00.880]  Not one second. Not one second to you. So the act is she stands up to the evil white man.
[15:06.640 --> 15:14.000]  You know, if I even talk about China, it's not like I'm saying Chinese people are bad.
[15:15.360 --> 15:20.080]  Communist are bad. They've killed 80 million according to the Communist Party in China.
[15:20.080 --> 15:24.960]  80 million of their own people. That's Chinese people.
[15:28.720 --> 15:34.960]  And they're killing millions every year or so. And they got Buddhists and everybody else in forced
[15:34.960 --> 15:43.920]  labor camps. And it's just her up there like America is the bad guy, like we're doing all
[15:43.920 --> 15:49.760]  this stuff. And it's this big distraction. And we're all in this bowl just in America
[15:49.760 --> 15:55.520]  and not talking about anything else that's going on in the world. It's crazy. That's what she paid
[15:55.520 --> 16:02.800]  to do. Staying healthy on the go is just as important as staying healthy at home. But sometimes

[20:41.200 --> 20:49.600]  in 35 seconds we've got joel scowlson who is an amazing researcher one of the smartest guys out
[20:49.600 --> 20:55.440]  there joining us and by the way i haven't talked to joel in months since he was last on we don't
[20:55.440 --> 20:59.920]  have pre-interviews beforehand like cnn or fox news does hey what are you going to talk about
[20:59.920 --> 21:05.520]  what's your view this is what we're looking for i have people that i respect that i know a research
[21:05.520 --> 21:11.360]  that i know are patriots and i hear their views and that's why they hate us if you ask why maitre
[21:11.360 --> 21:17.120]  media lies about us why george soros is suing us why hillary clinton is why she calls me the dark
[21:17.120 --> 21:21.760]  cart because i don't have a dark heart folks i really care about people and they know that and
[21:21.760 --> 21:26.880]  they're scared now that said ahead of him joining us there's an incredible article
[21:29.440 --> 21:30.800]  that the daily mail has
[21:33.280 --> 21:41.360]  it's also in red state it's also from press tv but it's the iranians so we can roll some
[21:41.360 --> 21:46.320]  in the background maybe well i talk about it but this is coming up with roger stone and you
[21:46.320 --> 21:52.480]  talk about the craziness and the average person would read this and think well wait a minute give
[21:52.480 --> 21:59.680]  the i a total is the dictators the religious islamic shia dictatorship it's the first islamic state
[21:59.680 --> 22:03.840]  in modern times but it's not well hobbyist out of iran they're trying to copy that it's it's shiai
[22:04.560 --> 22:07.920]  which means again they track it back to muhammad and the whole lineage and the rest of it
[22:10.240 --> 22:15.760]  they are saying because they have elections but they decide who can run so it's it's like communism
[22:15.760 --> 22:20.960]  with the current dictator of china the polar bureau the central committee decides he can
[22:20.960 --> 22:27.680]  run and then he has rules saying they can do it they have come out and i said this a few weeks
[22:27.680 --> 22:31.280]  ago i said listen because i could see what trump was saying i didn't get this from any sources
[22:32.720 --> 22:36.480]  well i i did get some of it from sources after but to be technical
[22:38.000 --> 22:42.160]  trumps like it's a horrible deal it's terrible and then i saw surrogates the president
[22:42.160 --> 22:46.240]  start pointing out that reportedly payoffs were made well we already knew that back at the time
[22:46.240 --> 22:52.240]  that's what the iranians do so obama and the arab spring and the muslim brotherhood and all of it
[22:52.240 --> 22:57.280]  in iran they're just taking money from anybody that's what globalism is to sell your country out to
[22:57.280 --> 23:04.320]  anybody and so here's the headline iran's foreign minister threatened to expose western diplomats
[23:04.320 --> 23:11.360]  who took bribes to create the iran nuclear deal wow so see we know they're developing nuclear
[23:11.360 --> 23:19.040]  weapons we know they've already got nuclear weapons i um well i'll just say it he's retired now but
[23:19.600 --> 23:23.520]  this is the age of just putting them all out there i had a family member who was in special
[23:23.520 --> 23:30.000]  operations 35 years in the army and i remember sitting around the deer camp 12 years ago
[23:31.440 --> 23:35.920]  eating um you know venison we'd shot the day before cook at the big cook deal and he said
[23:35.920 --> 23:40.320]  alex he said the reason we're not hitting iran is they're persians they got real terror networks
[23:40.320 --> 23:46.960]  and they got five atomic weapons they don't have a delivery system but if they try to deliver icbms
[23:46.960 --> 23:54.880]  we're gonna hit them and then and by the way people i've known family they never tell me anything
[23:55.920 --> 23:59.840]  i mean that cousin might have told me six seven things
[24:02.720 --> 24:06.880]  in all the years i've known him because he's probably like 10 years old when i was born
[24:06.880 --> 24:15.360]  and he told me that and he said that's the danger he said he said but if they try to
[24:16.000 --> 24:22.720]  develop icbms we're gonna hit them and he wouldn't get into it but he'd been part of the planning
[24:22.720 --> 24:27.120]  of how they're gonna hit tey run and all he was just saying no i've been part of the planning
[24:27.120 --> 24:32.800]  what's gonna some of the scenarios and he was like we're looking at their sleeper cells in the us
[24:32.800 --> 24:42.560]  and i said like what you know another cousin dumping chemicals down high rises air conditioning
[24:42.560 --> 24:48.160]  vents another cousin looked at me and he said and there are people working all the airports
[24:48.160 --> 24:52.640]  putting bombs on airplanes how about a hundred airplanes done in one day and i just remember
[24:52.640 --> 24:55.840]  talking to all these people in my family and realizing these were all the defenders of the
[24:55.840 --> 25:01.120]  republic and they'd already been briefed on what the issue was iran with iran it's not like iraq
[25:01.120 --> 25:07.120]  where it's some you know backwards fallen destroyed system and you know all this this is real folks
[25:08.720 --> 25:18.960]  and that's the issue and trump moves against them knowing that people are people are then gonna say
[25:20.880 --> 25:30.800]  well why then would they threaten obama to get at trump why would they threaten in a statewide tv
[25:30.800 --> 25:34.320]  show that we just showed of your radio lister you didn't see it in the background we just showed
[25:34.320 --> 25:39.280]  some we'll play something in a minute why would they threaten obama you think obama you know you
[25:39.280 --> 25:46.400]  think trump wants to get obama no no no they're telling obama and the deep state you take out
[25:46.400 --> 25:53.680]  trump that that's the headline iran is saying we're blackmailing obama with how we paid him off
[25:53.680 --> 25:57.520]  if you and your deep state don't take out trump we're gonna expose it that's the takeaway
[25:57.520 --> 26:06.480]  and that's how iran thinks and so there they're saying we paid you off we bought you off we made
[26:06.480 --> 26:20.160]  a deal we will expose those deals if you don't roll over to us how sick is that and i was told 12
[26:20.160 --> 26:26.720]  years ago and i've said it since i've been told by good sources i ran as five weapons and i went
[26:26.720 --> 26:31.120]  further with other sources i was told us and said yeah we've got spectrometers and aircraft
[26:31.920 --> 26:36.640]  that can fly over and scan this stuff even underneath mountains because it leaks out
[26:36.640 --> 26:42.800]  vents and we know what they've got and we even know the isotope and we know pakistan helped them
[26:43.680 --> 26:50.800]  and we know russia helped them and it was obama with russia and trump knows that there's your
[26:50.800 --> 26:56.320]  russia collusion here let's play a little bit of the current puppet dictator of iran installed by
[26:56.320 --> 27:01.840]  the moolas uh this is uh this is a breakdown that here here's a minute or so of that it's up on
[27:01.840 --> 27:10.880]  info wars dot com here it is and for all we will neither outsource our security nor will we renegotiate
[27:10.880 --> 27:19.680]  or add on to a deal we have already implemented in good faith to put it in real estate terms
[27:19.680 --> 27:28.240]  when you buy a house and move your family in or demolish it to build a skyscraper you cannot
[27:28.240 --> 27:37.600]  come back two years later and try to renegotiate the price in the coming days the united states
[27:37.600 --> 27:46.240]  will have to decide whether to finally abide by its obligations iran stands firm in the face
[27:46.240 --> 27:52.240]  of futile attempts at bullying but if the us continues to violate the agreement
[27:53.280 --> 28:02.480]  or if it withdraws altogether we will exercise our right to respond in a manner of our choice
[28:02.480 --> 28:05.040]  let's just stop right there and he goes into all the threats
[28:08.320 --> 28:12.160]  go ahead and dump chlorine gas in the buildings dude we're going to nuke your whole damn country
[28:12.160 --> 28:18.800]  but i'm just saying that's the point this has gotten to and this is the point with
[28:18.800 --> 28:23.280]  obama and the globalists that want an ongoing strategy of tension like north korea trump
[28:23.280 --> 28:28.240]  saying it's over it's done and the globalists hate it because they want to keep the crisis going
[28:28.240 --> 28:31.920]  trumps like no it's not going to continue now i don't know what jill scowles is going to say
[28:31.920 --> 28:36.560]  i'm going to agree with me disagree but we're going to cover it all one of the top experts in

[37:20.000 --> 37:24.720]  i respect you i mean i really i want listeners to know i respect you there's not a lot of folks
[37:24.720 --> 37:28.880]  that actually think may no more than i do you're one of them that sounds like a threat you better
[37:28.880 --> 37:33.360]  get rid of trump you better do something or we're gonna blow your whole operation wide open is that
[37:33.360 --> 37:40.800]  accurate or what is uh joel scousen have to say i'm not familiar with that quote alex can you read
[37:40.800 --> 37:45.200]  read me that again please yeah it's a red state article it's in a couple others iranians foreign
[37:45.200 --> 37:49.600]  minister basically threatens to expose western diplomats who took bribes to create the iran
[37:49.600 --> 37:55.040]  deal he just said hey we made deals we'll expose those deals if you don't go along with us and to
[37:55.040 --> 38:02.080]  me there's no leverage over trump the leverage is having telling them we're the jigs up you better
[38:02.080 --> 38:06.160]  move against trump i mean maybe you see some other angle there what do you what do you see there
[38:06.880 --> 38:11.760]  yeah i don't i think that's got to be disinformation and the reason i say that is because the us
[38:11.760 --> 38:17.600]  approached iran on that deal iran didn't bribe its way in or try to get the us to make a deal iran
[38:17.600 --> 38:22.320]  was shocked when the us came and said hey let's make a deal and we're going to make it easy for you
[38:22.880 --> 38:27.040]  so this was a one one-way street okay now remember you saying that so what's behind it
[38:28.880 --> 38:34.400]  well the thing that's behind it is that uh and i outlined this in the briefs that you mentioned
[38:34.400 --> 38:40.160]  that people can get a free copy of it they email me at editor at worldaffairsgreek.com i i go through
[38:40.160 --> 38:47.840]  an entire timeline of how the us uh was demanded by israel to take down syria before they attack
[38:47.840 --> 38:52.160]  iran iran has always been the target the globalists don't want a muslim country that's going to be
[38:52.160 --> 38:55.680]  self-sufficient in weapons no but i agree with you so let's look you're in a plenty of time here
[38:55.680 --> 39:01.520]  but let's back this up then why did they help then with the with the hostage stuff in the iran
[39:01.520 --> 39:06.560]  contra and and and then you got operation praying manus which wasn't for him i mean this kind of
[39:06.560 --> 39:12.000]  goes back and forth doesn't it well no that that goes way too far back that's not related to this
[39:12.000 --> 39:16.800]  iran nuclear deal the iran hostage cases and all there's been a lot of different administrations
[39:16.800 --> 39:21.440]  within iran that made sure so quantify for me then and i'll let you have the floor here but
[39:21.440 --> 39:27.120]  what is the point of what's currently going on then with iran what do you think trump really wants
[39:27.840 --> 39:34.160]  here's the point trump he doesn't want anything he just knows what he's told to say uh he's he
[39:34.160 --> 39:38.560]  has no knowledge about the iran deal he doesn't know it's in the substance of it he's been told
[39:38.560 --> 39:43.200]  that it's a bad deal and he has to get out of and he's done that but here's the backstory here and
[39:43.200 --> 39:45.840]  this is very very important by the way i'm going to give you the for the next segment people are
[39:45.840 --> 39:49.680]  getting mad at me interrupting but i agree with you trump's knowledgeable and free market and america
[39:49.680 --> 39:53.440]  and all this other stuff but when it comes to your political he does don't have the knowledge
[39:53.440 --> 39:59.200]  so he's being led around i agree with you so so let's elaborate on that so what happened is is that
[39:59.200 --> 40:03.840]  uh israel said to the globalist we're not going to attack iran until you take care of syria they got a
[40:03.840 --> 40:09.840]  thousand scud missiles they got chemical weapons they can obliterate us if iran and its allies retaliate
[40:09.840 --> 40:19.520]  after we strike this was clear back in 2011 or 12 and so in 2013 the us decided they were going to
[40:19.520 --> 40:25.520]  attack iran they first of all engineered all of the disruption in egypt and libya through their
[40:25.520 --> 40:32.640]  um overthrowing of qaddafi and the government of uh of egypt to create a lot of these muslim people
[40:32.640 --> 40:37.040]  that they could bring in the radicals to bring into syria to be the rebels wow you're saying the
[40:37.040 --> 40:41.360]  arab spring isn't about flooding europe with islamicist it's mainly about toppling iran
[40:42.080 --> 40:47.600]  it was both there's two agendas there but the major agenda uh you know has been to create
[40:48.400 --> 40:54.320]  enough radical is um that they could take down syria and create a habit but there's also that
[40:54.320 --> 40:59.440]  agenda flooding israel with and that was part of the all of the conflict creation in the middle east
[40:59.440 --> 41:04.880]  to flood the middle east and destroy western culture there but the main point that we have to
[41:04.880 --> 41:11.120]  understand is that they were going to use the red line of chemical weapons uh on Assad in order to
[41:11.120 --> 41:15.840]  justify this attack and so they engineered a chemical weapons attack in gupta the suburb of
[41:15.840 --> 41:20.800]  demasca but it was done by the rebels and it was blamed on Assad and we've talked about that on your
[41:20.800 --> 41:26.960]  show before Assad never would be stupid enough to use chemical weapons oh i should add you you said
[41:26.960 --> 41:31.760]  three four weeks ago it was staged it's now admitted in german news british news even trumps
[41:31.760 --> 41:36.160]  pulled back white helmet support that that last chemical attack didn't even happen the other three
[41:36.160 --> 41:40.400]  were staged by the rebels but now that this one didn't even happen exactly it wouldn't have they
[41:40.400 --> 41:44.400]  just hosed down some people and then cried out chemical attack and brought out the cameras this
[41:44.400 --> 41:51.680]  was a white helmet you know uh piece of work yeah yeah it was a production but the point is clear
[41:51.680 --> 41:57.920]  back in 2013 on the gupta attack they blamed it on Assad the usn you'd cross the red line we're
[41:57.920 --> 42:03.840]  going to attack john carrey gets before a london press conference and a reporter says hey mr carrey
[42:03.840 --> 42:09.120]  it looks obvious you're going to attack syria is there anything syria can do to stop this and
[42:09.120 --> 42:14.000]  carrey who was rambling all through this turn the chemicals over yeah he says you know give up the
[42:14.000 --> 42:17.920]  chemical what they won't do it but give up the chemical weapons that we wouldn't attack and russia
[42:17.920 --> 42:24.480]  and syria said we accept so he was stuck the globalists were stuck and while they tried to discredit
[42:24.480 --> 42:30.480]  the the handing over the chemicals the international community certified that they had given up all
[42:30.480 --> 42:36.400]  the chemical weapons and so that's why the us had to have an excuse now it's going to take years now
[42:36.400 --> 42:41.680]  to take down syria we're going to have to bring in all these rebels from other countries to overthrow
[42:41.680 --> 42:46.000]  syria all right stay there i've got where you're going you're on target kill scousins our guests

[46:09.760 --> 46:15.680]  shows to repeat their narrative over and over again and then they use their ex president to endorse
[46:15.680 --> 46:22.560]  the resistance all to make them march make them protest make them scream racism and sexism and

[47:35.200 --> 47:40.640]  on the business they're involved in shelling insurance or uh being a dentist working on
[47:40.640 --> 47:45.840]  people's teeth or maybe being a farmer or a computer programmer i've tried to become an
[47:45.840 --> 47:51.840]  expert on geopolitical systems cultural systems and how things work and i've found that you've
[47:51.840 --> 47:58.000]  got a bunch of occultists that want to control humanity and basically act like gods who want
[47:58.000 --> 48:04.560]  to dump people down well i want the opposite i want to empower people i want to see people
[48:05.840 --> 48:10.160]  living out their own destiny having free will but to do that we've got to be supported

[48:35.360 --> 48:40.880]  google documents they were spending millions of dollars to delist info wars and ron paul alex
[48:40.880 --> 48:46.160]  jones ron paul it said look at the fake news they claim that u n and others say no chemical
[48:46.160 --> 48:52.080]  attack happened and it was staged by the rebels we want them banned google said that's a real document
[48:52.080 --> 48:58.480]  we're sorry we're not going to do it now they went ahead with the delisting so that's an example

[50:24.480 --> 50:30.160]  for a free for all on north korea and the and trump in general uh but again joel scowles and
[50:30.160 --> 50:34.880]  great patriot editor of worldaffairsbrief.com now you've got the floor i want to interrupt the next
[50:34.880 --> 50:42.560]  seven minutes i ran all of this how's it tied together what's currently happening remember
[50:42.560 --> 50:49.520]  that iran was in the u.s was in the attack mode against iran ever since 2006 or so three aircraft
[50:49.520 --> 50:53.920]  carrying groups opera ran threatening to attack waiting for israel to trigger it that got put
[50:53.920 --> 50:59.360]  on hold with the syria them saying we got syria taken out first once that got them put on hold
[50:59.360 --> 51:05.120]  with the chemical weapons abandonment treaty the u.s knew it was going to take about three years to
[51:05.120 --> 51:12.800]  get rid of syria to get back on track against iran and so they had to have a public excuse to stand
[51:12.800 --> 51:19.600]  down from the attack mode against iran that's why they went to iran and said let's make a deal
[51:19.600 --> 51:25.040]  and we'll make it easy for you iran was shocked how easy the u.s was saying it but there was a
[51:25.040 --> 51:30.400]  trap involved there were three legs of the negotiation three different negotiations sessions
[51:30.400 --> 51:35.360]  on the very first one they said you have to give up just 20 percent of your centrifuges
[51:35.360 --> 51:39.680]  and a little bit of enrichment give up some of this and iran said hey that's a good deal and
[51:39.680 --> 51:45.200]  we'll get rid of the sanctions fine we agree then the u.s went on the press tour right after that
[51:45.200 --> 51:49.760]  and said iran has agreed to give 50 percent of those centrifuges up and 80 percent of their
[51:49.760 --> 51:55.920]  rich uranium and ran said no we didn't and we've got the transcripts to prove it but because they
[51:55.920 --> 52:01.040]  wanted those sanctions off so bad they were hurting the country so bad including humanitarian supplies
[52:01.040 --> 52:06.720]  iran went along with it well the u.s did this two other times to them the second round they went
[52:06.720 --> 52:12.160]  and falsified what they had agreed to and iran went along with it and they said hey we got a good
[52:12.160 --> 52:18.080]  thing going there we could push iran further than what we think so in the third round they added the
[52:18.080 --> 52:25.040]  trap that is they added a ban on conventional missile development into the iran nuclear agreement
[52:25.040 --> 52:28.560]  what does that got to do with the nuclear weapons well they said we'll tie this because these are
[52:28.560 --> 52:35.200]  nuclear capable missiles therefore we want you to ban them and iran never did sign off on that
[52:35.840 --> 52:42.000]  and the u.s and iran never did sign the agreement the u.s took it to the un with their version
[52:42.000 --> 52:49.920]  including the missile ban and got the un security council to pass that agreement now iran went along
[52:49.920 --> 52:54.320]  with it even though they haven't signed it because they got their hundred eighty five million dollars
[52:54.320 --> 53:01.200]  back and the u.s keeps telling me telling the american public that they gave 185 billion dollars to
[53:01.200 --> 53:06.800]  iran as a reward for signing the deal that is false that was iran's money that the u.s had
[53:06.800 --> 53:15.680]  confiscated your frozen in accounts that's right now the trap was about nuclear missiles and you'll
[53:15.680 --> 53:22.320]  notice and a lot of yeah trump obsesses over the icbm's all right that's what he's been told this
[53:22.320 --> 53:28.560]  is what's dangerous about iran and the u.s has tried to make the case two times in the un that
[53:28.560 --> 53:34.560]  iran's nuclear or their iran's ballistic missile testing is like north korea these are nuclear
[53:34.560 --> 53:38.960]  capable and therefore they're a violation of the agreement tried to get the un to go against iran
[53:38.960 --> 53:47.760]  iran the un refused they said no iran is right the the the these are not nuclear capable they don't
[53:47.760 --> 53:53.680]  have any connections to nuclear weapons so they do not qualify now so what this meant is the u.s
[53:53.680 --> 53:59.680]  decided this the trap failed they were going to use this agreement the nuclear agreement not to
[53:59.680 --> 54:04.320]  give anything to iran they're going to make it easy for iran to comply so that they could
[54:04.320 --> 54:08.960]  go back to iran when they were ready to by the way just briefly the reason i agree with you is
[54:09.520 --> 54:15.680]  we've sided with the wahhabis in saudi arabia and this muslim civil war even though on the surface
[54:15.680 --> 54:19.760]  obama was acting like he's for iran he's been opening the middle east up with the arab spring
[54:19.760 --> 54:25.920]  he's been backing saudi arabia for their takeover of egypt uh libya syria you name it so that fits
[54:25.920 --> 54:32.720]  into what you're saying is they were double crossing that's right so once the trap had failed
[54:32.720 --> 54:36.800]  that's when they put the pressure on trump to say uh this agreement is bad you need to
[54:36.800 --> 54:41.520]  pull out of the agreement what's the purpose of pulling out they want to induce iran to start
[54:41.520 --> 54:46.080]  enriching against start their nuclear weapons program again so which iran's saying they're
[54:46.080 --> 54:52.000]  going to do it so you're saying iran's leading in the trap look iran's saying they're going to do it
[54:52.000 --> 54:56.720]  but they're not admitting that there's a weapons program they're not going to give the u.s the
[54:56.720 --> 55:02.080]  smoking out look iran has said we're going to retaliate against israel for attacking our bases
[55:02.080 --> 55:06.720]  in syria they've said that twice now and they've never done it and i have written in my world
[55:06.720 --> 55:11.440]  for his brief has said look watch out iran this is a trap they just want you to retaliate by the
[55:11.440 --> 55:17.040]  way i want to be clear here just so i can understand you're absolutely right the media is like four
[55:17.040 --> 55:22.720]  days ago iran's going to strike israel then israel hits iranian bases south of damascus show and i'm
[55:22.720 --> 55:27.760]  not anti-israel either but what's going on in israel why is this happening you got to remember
[55:27.760 --> 55:32.880]  israel is a globalist puppet i mean netanyahu's a kissinger protege a kissinger paid for his
[55:32.880 --> 55:38.640]  education in the u.s he's only masquerading as a pro-settler right-wing prime minister
[55:39.760 --> 55:44.160]  and he's got a lot of corruption problems and he's been able to forego those with this thread of
[55:44.160 --> 55:50.720]  iran here but you see israel is claiming self-defense we have to defend ourselves but it's israel that
[55:50.720 --> 55:58.480]  has been attacking syria they've had they've had over 150 attacks against syria and no retaliation
[55:58.480 --> 56:06.160]  until last week when israel one of the iranian bases launched some short-range and by the way
[56:06.160 --> 56:11.360]  my sources in the pentagon say they they think that was a false flag they think those those
[56:11.360 --> 56:17.920]  20 rockets were not iran well they may well be because iran said they didn't do it but the point is
[56:17.920 --> 56:27.520]  israel retaliated with striking 70 targets in syria over what one little military outposts
[56:27.520 --> 56:32.240]  in the golan height got hit with no deaths we're about to go to break but but we're gonna come back
[56:32.240 --> 56:36.080]  you'll have the floor to break this down joe scowles and world fair brief editor what's the
[56:36.080 --> 56:42.160]  bigger picture then i mean well how does this feed into the larger picture well the bigger picture
[56:42.160 --> 56:48.560]  is that they've got to get to iran there is that big creating conflict to have flood europe with
[56:48.560 --> 56:54.240]  refugees but they also want to build the image of the us is the bully of the world and that's what
[56:54.240 --> 56:59.280]  they've been doing by intervening around the world in the middle east in iraq in now in iran and
[56:59.280 --> 57:05.760]  they're going to obliterate iran's infrastructure someday pretty soon i'm expecting an attack on
[57:05.760 --> 57:10.400]  iran to materialize probably within the month but this will not be the trigger to world war three
[57:10.400 --> 57:15.360]  that's still reserved for north korea which we can talk about all right joel scowles is one of the
[57:15.360 --> 57:22.240]  smartest guys out there folks so we're gonna talk to him for a few segments next hour this is really
[57:22.240 --> 57:26.720]  serious i think trump means well he's doing a great job many fronts the globalist hating but
[57:27.280 --> 57:33.600]  he i mean i get it he's like a he's a real estate magnet he's in there listening to people around him
[57:33.600 --> 57:39.600]  and he just has done does not have the research i don't say that i can elitist i that's just a
[57:39.600 --> 57:44.000]  fact and they're playing on that please tell your friends and family tune in next hour starts now

[01:00:26.800 --> 01:00:32.400]  jones we'll get into north korea and the bigger geopolitical connections here but i'm during the
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:36.080]  last little two minute break i was talking to jones calzen who is a really smart guy
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:41.280]  from a rinkor aviator officer smart you know best selling author his uncle exposed the whole
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:45.840]  globalist program hopefully i want to get him up the producer set this up for a full hour to talk
[01:00:45.840 --> 01:00:52.000]  about 45 communist goals 1963 all this came true that his uncle got on the congressional record
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:59.200]  playing on scousin and listen it's not that i'm a tough guy joe it's that i realized the evil of
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:03.040]  the globalist so that's why i have to fight him we were talking to the break about how they're
[01:01:03.040 --> 01:01:06.880]  coming after info wars how they're trying to destroy us we'll cover the other subject but
[01:01:06.880 --> 01:01:11.520]  the four minutes we have left you're making us a point why do you think the listeners understand
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:18.800]  they're so after this broadcast you know the biggest weapon that they use alex in suppressing
[01:01:18.800 --> 01:01:23.920]  truth is omission to make sure that you never hear the truth they'll talk around it though
[01:01:24.720 --> 01:01:28.960]  i mean it's just like fox news fox news talks about conservative issues but they will never
[01:01:28.960 --> 01:01:35.600]  touch conspiracy conspiracy is the golden standard of truth now it is the ultimate thing
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:40.800]  that people have to know about what really is going to save us it doesn't matter what you do in
[01:01:40.800 --> 01:01:45.600]  terms of sessions or trump or anything else unless you understand how the deep state really works
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:51.360]  how deep the conspiracy runs with congress with the courts with law with the legal profession
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:55.840]  with the medical profession with all of these things that are tied together it has to be credible
[01:01:55.840 --> 01:02:01.200]  information and that's what they fear most out of info wars you are the largest voice
[01:02:01.200 --> 01:02:06.960]  of conspiratorial truths and that doesn't mean that you get everything perfectly right all of us
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:12.960]  are flawed remember this is a secret conspiracy we're trying to ferret out the information from
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:19.520]  the edges without plants and disinformation from insiders we always have to combat that and i know
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:28.480]  you do too but you know it's amazing how they come out against anyone who speaks about conspiracy
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:32.720]  Sean Hannity for example is very very good on fox news about conservative issues and defending
[01:02:32.720 --> 01:02:38.960]  trump etc but if you ever utter the word conspiracy or a hint that you're going in that direction
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:44.320]  he'll come out like a lion against you because he's been told that he's a good guy i want to get
[01:02:44.320 --> 01:02:49.280]  an inside baseball you have to write so here i am like a man taken drink before you know the gallows
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:55.520]  what you're a smart guy i mean this what should i do to get myself ready for whatever's coming
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:59.680]  all the attacks it's it's it's getting really intense and not only makes you want to fight
[01:02:59.680 --> 01:03:06.080]  harder but i don't know what to do against this level of evil well you have to do what all of us
[01:03:06.080 --> 01:03:11.600]  do in this movement you have to watch out for entrapment they are watching us day and night
[01:03:11.600 --> 01:03:16.400]  they're following they're watching every conversation no i agree but i don't i mean i'm
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:24.000]  i'm pretty boring i mean that's what i'm saying there's nothing there well you've got to be careful
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:27.360]  that there's nothing there i mean you have to really watch it and i know that you're trying
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:34.080]  to be careful i try to be very careful but they really do need some big scandal to take you down
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:38.960]  and ban you from the internet now i think you're doing the right thing by going towards quality
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:46.880]  product sales in order to bypass this censorship for your financial interest on youtube and google
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:51.680]  and everything else uh and that's the price of being big and strong is there you're going to be
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:56.240]  the number one target you are the number one target but well i agree i don't feel sorry for
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:01.280]  myself i'm just wondering i i just feel like i should be doing more i just like being the target
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:06.880]  it's like what am i supposed to do i don't feel like i'm this big threat i don't feel big like
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:12.560]  what am i supposed to do the only thing i would say was to is to be very very careful about people
[01:04:12.560 --> 01:04:18.320]  who are talking to you who are claiming to be insiders i agree i go i think q non for example
[01:04:18.320 --> 01:04:24.160]  is a disinformation expert uh i think he's telling people what they want he's anybody
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:30.320]  who pervades this message anyone claiming to be in the white house or the inside that there's
[01:04:30.320 --> 01:04:34.560]  going to be a coup against the beach state that they're going to take down the beach state that
[01:04:34.560 --> 01:04:37.920]  they've got military hold on this is powerful i want to hear what you have to say about q and
[01:04:37.920 --> 01:04:43.280]  august this is the deal i had white house sources and all hell broke loose at levels i can't even
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:48.960]  say personally it was hard you're right no one has these sources or they get attacked we'll talk about

[01:06:08.800 --> 01:06:14.000]  look from enemies foreign and domestic it's alex jones
[01:06:17.360 --> 01:06:24.480]  show there was a time about a year and a half ago when the president was first in office
[01:06:25.440 --> 01:06:31.680]  that i knew for a fact every night he would ask people for specific downloads of the show to
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:36.560]  see what i said and if i said here's a message the president he would watch it and i talked to him
[01:06:36.560 --> 01:06:42.640]  about those things but then they made it a big deal not to talk to me and it's not like i'm trying to
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:46.560]  reach out and talk to president like that's some big deal i i talked to god every day and he ever
[01:06:46.560 --> 01:06:51.520]  said love christ you know that so the president's way down the list of that but they they went kind
[01:06:51.520 --> 01:06:57.840]  of crazy and the last few times i talked to president last year towards the end of the year
[01:06:57.840 --> 01:07:03.360]  it was very quick just keep it up i appreciate what you're doing and don't stop what you're doing i
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:08.080]  appreciate you and i told the president just like i told him when he called i got remarried
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:11.600]  he called and thanked my wife and everything i said sir you don't have to do this i want to be
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:16.480]  pat on the head if you got info and he's like well alex you know don't worry about john mccain
[01:07:16.480 --> 01:07:20.800]  we're going to move forward we're going to country grade again he knows he's being recorded so it's
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:25.360]  not about me who rejects hollywood and all this stuff trying to be next to power it's that
[01:07:25.360 --> 01:07:29.600]  trump is trying to be good i believe but joel scowles is a really smart guy world the first
[01:07:29.600 --> 01:07:35.680]  brief the editor-in-chief of that and we were talking about the attacks that we've come under
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:41.680]  at info wars and the lies they've said and the things they've done i mean if i could tell the
[01:07:41.680 --> 01:07:47.520]  listeners which i can't do this family's asking not to and i'm not whining i'm not complaining
[01:07:47.520 --> 01:07:54.880]  it's just you think you're ready to face evil until you face it and they it's spiritual they
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:08:01.360]  it's like agent smith in uh the matrix where it jumps into people that's basically what it's like
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:07.040]  which makes you even love god more and want to be good more but then it's so evil and out of
[01:08:07.040 --> 01:08:09.920]  control you don't even know what to do is from the eight months we have left all scowles and
[01:08:10.800 --> 01:08:14.880]  specifically because i know the president still occasionally sees the show what would you say
[01:08:14.880 --> 01:08:19.760]  the president what would you get into north korea you got cut off by the break uh getting into their
[01:08:19.760 --> 01:08:24.240]  disinformation operations what we should worry about just in the last eight months we have left
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:32.480]  your big smart is your smart guy download for folks but what i would tell the president was first of
[01:08:32.480 --> 01:08:38.320]  all you have to understand that the deep state created isis they created al-qaeda and they run
[01:08:38.320 --> 01:08:44.720]  the rebels and they run arms that you already being told about they are creating two bases on
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:48.960]  sovereign territory and syrian government which you have never been told about they said this
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:55.360]  needs to stop syria isn't your enemy either is iran if you would back off you would find that iran
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:09:02.880]  would start to be more reasonable now i mean but the point is he's my biggest warning of course
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:08.000]  would be about north korea i would tell him you're being set up for a psychological operation
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:14.080]  by them touting or offering you a Nobel peace prize by them offering to have a final truce
[01:09:14.080 --> 01:09:22.320]  over a full peace treaty on north korea by offering you a denuclearization there is no
[01:09:22.320 --> 01:09:28.560]  way that trump in june 12 at this meeting in singapore is going to get anything concrete
[01:09:28.560 --> 01:09:35.280]  to prove denuclearization i mean the dismantling of the test thing is a falsehood the test
[01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:41.440]  center for nuclear weapons collapsed through earthquakes i mean this is just a throwaway
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:47.280]  to say that we're going to dismantle this the earth is dismantled it i didn't think of that you
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:52.160]  just said it it was six months ago the earthquake collapsed that they're going to blow up the entrance
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:58.160]  of a collapsed space that's exactly right so you see this is a throwaway and trump is being fooled
[01:09:58.160 --> 01:10:03.040]  by these types of everyone is around him is telling me look you're winning this is a success you're
[01:10:03.040 --> 01:10:08.240]  going to be a hero you're going to get a Nobel peace prize they are setting him up psychologically
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:12.640]  to look the other way at the fact that he's not going to get anything concrete i don't know
[01:10:12.640 --> 01:10:17.840]  what could you get i have told him in the world affairs brief if he ever reads that thing which
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:21.920]  i don't think he does i said what you need to do at that meeting in june 12th it says
[01:10:22.560 --> 01:10:27.040]  you have two weeks to allow international inspectors to come in and take possession
[01:10:27.040 --> 01:10:31.680]  of your nuclear weapon experimental or nuclear experimental well let me stop you you may have
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:37.680]  missed it the south korean news reports and i made a phone call to sent com they said no that's true
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:43.200]  Pompeo has demanded five nukes to be dismantled in paris so what you just said is what trumps
[01:10:43.200 --> 01:10:47.360]  according to my sources that have never been wrong is happening but still that's not enough
[01:10:47.360 --> 01:10:51.520]  what i'm just saying you need international inspect to take possession and go actually
[01:10:51.520 --> 01:10:56.400]  and occupy the factories it doesn't matter taking a few nuclear weapons out and dismantling sure
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:11:01.040]  what do you make of Pompeo saying we're going to send in private interest to rebuild north korea
[01:11:01.040 --> 01:11:04.720]  because the north scott want to be the south the most productive country in the world i mean
[01:11:04.720 --> 01:11:10.480]  i want to believe in this deal joe you're saying it's a screw job yeah it is there's never been
[01:11:10.480 --> 01:11:15.280]  a communist country that is ever disarmed ever and i include in that the phony fall of the
[01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:20.720]  sub union they never disarmed during that fall of the sub union but this is going to be a trap i
[01:11:20.720 --> 01:11:25.360]  think china is so interested in delaying this attack on north korea because they aren't ready
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:30.400]  to follow through with world war three i think they're willing to even if trump pushes them to
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:34.880]  take possession of those new pure weapons that's the easy way out because they can bring them right
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:40.160]  back when they want sure they can roll them across the border well you've always said towards 2022-25
[01:11:40.160 --> 01:11:45.120]  that was the plan china now says they're they're they're they're they're doc they're doctrine is
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:51.600]  to be ready to attack us in 2020 yeah that's probably a little bit early uh remember russia's
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:56.000]  got to be ready to they both got to get a much bigger blue water navy to be able to occupy sure
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:00.400]  is there and they're launching the new carriers is there any way to get them to stop this this is
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:07.200]  insane i mean well you've got to remember the problem is the globalists really want this third
[01:12:07.200 --> 01:12:11.920]  world war they want a nuclear preemptive strike they want new population they want to end it all
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:17.600]  well they don't want to end it all they i mean i mean in the current order yeah and the current
[01:12:17.600 --> 01:12:23.360]  order is that the us defends the world they want the us military decapitated so they can get out
[01:12:23.360 --> 01:12:28.400]  of there but no no a new power emerges with all their deep state and a militarized global
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:32.880]  government is what we've got to have and who's going to say nay when you've been new then let me

[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:57.120]  person and i'm going to tell the audience i'm really doing this selfishly i intend to try to
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:00.960]  stay here and fix things if we can but southern hemisphere i don't see that surviving in the
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:08.560]  year war joel you're a global expert on relocation where in the world can i take my children and my
[01:13:08.560 --> 01:13:15.760]  wife if i don't want to die a nuclear holocaust well you've got to be in the united states uh
[01:13:15.760 --> 01:13:20.720]  for the long term in the short term any place in south america is going to be freed from a nuclear
[01:13:20.720 --> 01:13:26.240]  holocaust but it's not going to it's not going to survive the cutoff of the economy those countries
[01:13:26.240 --> 01:13:30.960]  are all which is equivalent of a zombie apocalypse that's right those those countries are all social
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:36.480]  as they depend on influence you predicted in on air 10 years ago the venezuela collapse
[01:13:36.480 --> 01:13:42.880]  that would be eating people it's now happening and don't go to new zealand in australia australia
[01:13:42.880 --> 01:13:47.280]  so come back on this week why are the elites fleeing there then i mean i was told this by
[01:13:47.280 --> 01:13:51.200]  multi billionaires years ago come to new zealand with us they're all leaving there joel what what
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:57.280]  are that what are they told they're not in the know they may be elite but they're not in no i agree
[01:13:57.280 --> 01:14:03.280]  with you so tell me you you are in the oh tell me well i'm telling you that china's going to occupy

[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:11.440]  they are so so what i'm asking you is why are the globalists moving to new zealand i mean
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:18.000]  it that's because there are there are globalists that are wealthy elite that are being used and
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:21.760]  part of the system but they're not in the no i agree they're not on the inside group so
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:27.680]  what about kawaii because zuckerberg's there schmitz there a lot of that that's where a lot of the
[01:14:27.680 --> 01:14:32.160]  wheel so none of these people they're they're a yes man to the global new world order but they
[01:14:32.160 --> 01:14:39.040]  don't know the war agenda that's going to be for no i agree with you so i don't know i mean where

[01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:17.920]  and respiratory function in the 1960s researchers in france notice that people who ate certain
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:23.840]  quail eggs experience less seasonal immune and inflammatory responses they began studying this
[01:19:23.840 --> 01:19:29.120]  effect in published trials and decades later we now have the fruit of this research a fast
[01:19:29.120 --> 01:19:34.560]  acting chewable tablet that helps alleviate seasonal distress symptoms pollen block is
[01:19:34.560 --> 01:19:40.560]  natural and effective it is not an antihistamine in fact current research has found that it actually
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:46.240]  acts by blocking the activity of triptase which is an enzyme that amplifies immune and inflammatory

[01:19:55.440 --> 01:20:07.920]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[01:20:15.440 --> 01:20:21.840]  and it is sunday night for the next few segments roger stone joins us to break down some exclusive
[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:27.600]  information now i don't think it's pearls before swine how much exclusive information we load
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:32.320]  out of the public here on this broadcast but this is particularly inside intel that's why
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:38.080]  they fear this broadcast it's why the establishment attacks it continuously because we are not control
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:44.480]  now we know that there have been giant disinformation campaigns going on against the
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:49.040]  white house and we know that there's been these big lawsuits and criminal charges filed by
[01:20:49.040 --> 01:20:55.440]  a Mueller this clinton operative and now people actually showing up in court challenge him he's
[01:20:55.440 --> 01:21:01.840]  trying to drop the cases so it's the same thing here when we say we're going to expose who is the
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:10.320]  supposed mole inside the trump campaign it's like being a mole at your sunday church service who saw
[01:21:10.320 --> 01:21:15.920]  the preacher give a sermon or a mole that you know watch your wife cook eggs in the morning
[01:21:15.920 --> 01:21:21.440]  or a mole who saw you you know put your kids books in their book bag and drop them off at school it's
[01:21:21.440 --> 01:21:27.120]  not like oh there's a mole of something illegal but we know who is connected to the establishment
[01:21:27.120 --> 01:21:32.480]  and who was trying to get people early on in the trump campaign to say things that were incriminating
[01:21:32.480 --> 01:21:38.640]  and who was bringing up russia first we know who patient zero is and so exclusively here we're
[01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:45.200]  going to tell you who the smart money's on as the supposed mole and joining us from new york
[01:21:45.200 --> 01:21:50.240]  in his studios there is roger stone former head of the trump campaign worked in five administrations
[01:21:50.240 --> 01:21:54.800]  and of course is the best-selling author roger thanks for joining us how it's great to be here
[01:21:55.600 --> 01:22:00.240]  well start rolling with it you're the expert on this let's let's let's let's announce who we believe
[01:22:00.240 --> 01:22:06.400]  is the so-called mole who were who reported nothing well first of all let's stop and reflect for a
[01:22:06.400 --> 01:22:15.120]  moment on the stunning news that the fbi planted a spy inside the presidential campaign of the
[01:22:15.120 --> 01:22:22.320]  republican candidate for president this is a tip of the iceberg of the larger scandal regarding
[01:22:22.320 --> 01:22:28.320]  the use of the state capacity for surveillance and authority for surveillance and through the use of
[01:22:28.320 --> 01:22:37.040]  fice phony fice awards this next shoe to drop the the fbi plant inside the trump campaign
[01:22:37.040 --> 01:22:44.160]  is stunning news now there's a guessing game going on in official washington as to who the
[01:22:44.160 --> 01:22:51.600]  operative is i've examined all of the evidence and discussed the matter with colleagues and
[01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:58.800]  i believe that is most likely that the deep mole is steve helper now who is steve helper first of
[01:22:58.800 --> 01:23:08.000]  all he is the son-in-law of a legendary bush neocon operative ray clines uh steve helper was the
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:16.320]  chief chief foreign policy advisor to presidential candidate george hw bush uh when he ran against
[01:23:16.320 --> 01:23:25.680]  ronald reagan in 1980 uh his wife his father-in-law and he have all extremely uh deep ties to the
[01:23:25.680 --> 01:23:32.640]  deep state to the cia to the national security council uh into that entire uh intelligent i
[01:23:32.640 --> 01:23:36.240]  should add he's the one we know with three different people out of the blue saying let me
[01:23:36.240 --> 01:23:40.640]  fly in here to discuss russia are you russian operative you know anything about russians
[01:23:40.640 --> 01:23:48.640]  now uh i actually have met steve helper because former nra president david keen had a floating
[01:23:48.640 --> 01:23:56.400]  crap game at his home uh and i was a sometimes a tender helper was a very good poker player
[01:23:56.400 --> 01:24:03.600]  he is a duplicitous very smart and deeply deeply committed to the globalist agenda he has an
[01:24:03.600 --> 01:24:11.520]  effacing kind of shrub personality that i think really hides a uh a steel trap mind and a capacity
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:18.320]  for exactly this type of activity so clearly this man and miss man is a psychotic well he is very
[01:24:18.320 --> 01:24:24.320]  very bright he's very ambitious he was appointed to high positions in both the bush and reagan
[01:24:24.320 --> 01:24:32.960]  administrations uh he is it was deeply committed uh to the uh to the the new the one world agenda of
[01:24:32.960 --> 01:24:39.600]  the bushes we have a photo him uh here unclothed classified we're releasing now extremely handsome
[01:24:39.600 --> 01:24:46.480]  i should add well uh he's a very self-effacing kind of likable guy we make sarcastic we're
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:52.080]  showing the image of a naked mole right now as a joke sorry sorry roger i can't help it that's
[01:24:52.080 --> 01:24:59.760]  okay uh so um but this stunning news alex shows that their whole phony edifice is starting to
[01:24:59.760 --> 01:25:06.720]  crumble look they call me a dirty trickster the russian collusion hoax which is covering up the
[01:25:06.720 --> 01:25:13.600]  biggest uh assault on our civil liberties in american history the largest scandal in american
[01:25:13.600 --> 01:25:19.840]  history and that's the biggest dirty trick of all time and you know they're now getting called on it
[01:25:19.840 --> 01:25:26.880]  uh this is just another major piece of evidence the fbi penetrating donald trump's campaign
[01:25:26.880 --> 01:25:33.040]  that's outrageous isn't that what they sent nixon down for for uh allegedly wiretapping
[01:25:33.040 --> 01:25:38.000]  the opposition in this case it's even worse because they've used the authority and the
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:43.520]  capability of the state where nixon's bungled job was a private job by the way it's funny you
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:50.080]  bring that up who wasn't i saw on friday made this point that trump wants to expose the iran deal
[01:25:50.080 --> 01:25:57.040]  because it's a bad deal but also because reportedly hundreds of millions got paid to obama and others
[01:25:57.040 --> 01:26:01.600]  and we know they were big into that well now the iranian government it's on info wars dot com if
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:06.000]  we're gonna tell the crew pull it up the iranian press tv this is the official channel i don't
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.960]  just believe it by seeing on cnn of course it wasn't on cnn it was on info wars dot com i saw

[01:27:54.800 --> 01:28:00.960]  we are the country we're not the ones taking foreign money roger no in fact the reason that the deep
[01:28:00.960 --> 01:28:06.800]  state is fighting so ferociously is because they know they're the ones who face jail sentences
[01:28:06.800 --> 01:28:11.920]  they're the ones who face disgrace they're the ones who violated the law they are the ones who've
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:18.320]  engaged in treason that's why they must accuse us of these very crimes and destroy us because it's us
[01:28:18.320 --> 01:28:24.640]  or them and they realize that and their whole phony facade is crumbling before our very eyes

[01:33:27.680 --> 01:33:32.720]  final segment because you know wild horses can't shut me up i'm gonna have him host the final
[01:33:32.720 --> 01:33:36.560]  segment coming up before this nine and a half minute segment roger stones here with us so
[01:33:36.560 --> 01:33:42.400]  here's the red state article and then it links to press tv i mean i don't just believe
[01:33:43.360 --> 01:33:46.240]  you know mainstream media here in the us or even red state who are good folks
[01:33:46.800 --> 01:33:51.200]  iran foreign minister threatened to expose western diplomats who took bribe to create
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:55.600]  the iran nuclear deal here's the thing the whole establishment's pissed at trump
[01:33:56.160 --> 01:34:00.960]  because he's kicking the lobbyist out because he's making it about america now they all turn
[01:34:00.960 --> 01:34:08.160]  it into michael cohen novartis uh at nt giving him some money to advise them that's totally legal
[01:34:08.800 --> 01:34:13.440]  i'm surprised there's not more lobbying in the trump operation he's lost probably a billion
[01:34:13.440 --> 01:34:17.360]  dollars being sued in attack i know we're under attack you're under attack i'm not just blindly
[01:34:17.360 --> 01:34:22.160]  defending the president i don't care if he gets money or even gets funded under these attacks
[01:34:22.160 --> 01:34:26.480]  as long as he's bringing jobs back pro america but separate from that they want to make it about
[01:34:26.480 --> 01:34:33.920]  cohen getting money from at nt and a drug novartis or whatever uh to like advise them i mean i've
[01:34:33.920 --> 01:34:37.600]  i've been paid to advise major companies before because they really want my advice but how is
[01:34:37.600 --> 01:34:43.040]  that illegal where are the russians they're not there except if you look at hillary but meanwhile
[01:34:44.080 --> 01:34:49.600]  iran is pissed now in press tv this is on info wars dot com you're radio listening go look at
[01:34:49.600 --> 01:34:55.600]  up yourself threatening to release u.s government officials they bribed for the deal that's the
[01:34:55.600 --> 01:35:01.360]  briar patch trump wants to be in what do you make of this roger stone uh you know i think you're
[01:35:01.360 --> 01:35:07.920]  calling it right on the head alex uh the president has told me repeatedly since the beginning of his
[01:35:07.920 --> 01:35:14.400]  term that he was determined to get us out of the iran deal which he thought was a bad deal a rip off
[01:35:14.400 --> 01:35:20.480]  as he would put it and he was always determined his own state department many of his own foreign
[01:35:20.480 --> 01:35:28.720]  policy advisors argued against it uh the foreign policy establishment argued against it john carrey
[01:35:28.720 --> 01:35:34.880]  went out and engaged in personal diplomacy in violation of federal law the logan act and
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:39.520]  should be so let me ask you you've got all the answers why would they do something so reckless
[01:35:39.520 --> 01:35:45.040]  with this mula dictatorship what why did they do something that doesn't make sense this is why he
[01:35:45.040 --> 01:35:50.720]  was so determined because he knew he had this whole card i think you've hit it exactly on the head
[01:35:50.720 --> 01:35:55.920]  uh and i think he knew and this became public uh it would undermine what little support the deal
[01:35:55.920 --> 01:36:00.480]  has exactly so what are the moolas thinking because i said weeks ago it's about exposing the bribery
[01:36:00.480 --> 01:36:04.800]  which was starting to come out are the moolas selling deep state kill trump or will out you
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:11.040]  i think they are i think they are at that point i say vaporize their ass i'm against these wars
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:17.200]  but i'm tired of putting up with their iranian uh you know garbage i honestly believe the thing
[01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:25.040]  that bothers uh the president the most is a concept of pallets of cash hundreds of millions of dollars
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:33.920]  in 36 billion now in golden cash not accounted for in the basic agreement like a secret side deal
[01:36:33.920 --> 01:36:38.560]  kept from the american people which we now know was a kickback to them so so how big is this
[01:36:38.560 --> 01:36:43.680]  that torques trump beyond all words that we're being ripped off like let's explain he's a big
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:49.120]  penny pincher he's the cheapest human being ever lived and that's the guy you want as the steward
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:53.920]  of our tax dollars well he's totally delivering and i was going to interrupt you can make your
[01:36:53.920 --> 01:36:58.640]  points by the round and i've got my points go ahead i think that uh that that you're exactly
[01:36:58.640 --> 01:37:04.240]  right that he always knew that he had this as a whole card which is why he faced down the entire
[01:37:04.240 --> 01:37:10.320]  establishment and went ahead and cashiered this lousy deal needless to say this whips the deep
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:16.240]  state types into a another level of hysteria that they've got to get rid of as quickly as possible
[01:37:16.240 --> 01:37:21.760]  he's already taken us out of paris they were apoplectic about that uh the paris climate
[01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:29.680]  accords uh now it's the iranian deal he's on the hill the tpp no listen i criticized him on syria
[01:37:29.680 --> 01:37:34.400]  but that was because i love him but i the only people think i'm off the trump train it's the
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:39.920]  opposite he's so good it's crazy what do you make a brennan coming out and saying trump's a chump
[01:37:39.920 --> 01:37:43.200]  with north korea when they're about to blow up their tunnels they've agreed to give up their
[01:37:43.200 --> 01:37:47.840]  nooks you can tell wanting to have peace and actually deciding to do it i mean you can see
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:52.000]  the shift because the globalists never wanted peace trump's saying it's over i mean this is
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:57.520]  incredible no basically brennan is publicly admitting that he couldn't get a deal done
[01:37:57.520 --> 01:38:03.360]  that he and bush could not get a deal done that he and obama could not a deal get a deal done
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:09.280]  because the north koreans viewed us as pussies now the north koreans now believe that the united
[01:38:09.280 --> 01:38:14.560]  states has got a real leader who will smack the hard if they get out of line and that peace is
[01:38:14.560 --> 01:38:20.960]  much more palatable than uh than somebody who is not going to let you get away with what obama
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:26.400]  let him get away with uh in this case the saber rattling has paid off it brought them to the table
[01:38:26.400 --> 01:38:30.320]  well roger you're one of my big sources but obviously you know i've got a lot of big sources
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:35.600]  and i was told when i was on a skiing trip in early march that they already agreed
[01:38:35.600 --> 01:38:38.800]  tacitly to get everything up this was all going to happen because there have been a strategic
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:43.920]  tension uh and that the globalists didn't want peace before the us was basically had more control
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:49.200]  of north koreas with the clintons than the chinese did now you hear word for what i was told a month
[01:38:49.200 --> 01:38:55.680]  and a half ago Pompeo on fox news this morning um said fox news sunday said we're going to give them
[01:38:55.680 --> 01:38:59.120]  power plants we're going to give them industry and they go oh but he's a dictator he's like it
[01:38:59.120 --> 01:39:03.840]  won't matter it's like china the people are going to get meat they're going to get food our deal is
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:07.840]  that we're going to industrialize them korea is the most productive country in the world per capita
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:11.920]  we're about to do that it looks like trump has successfully so you know china's had a bunch of
[01:39:11.920 --> 01:39:17.760]  wars with korea they actually hate korea trump has successfully peeled them off if this ends up
[01:39:17.760 --> 01:39:23.440]  happening this is the ultimate coup against communism i am beside myself if this happens
[01:39:23.440 --> 01:39:31.200]  well alex uh the little rocket man wants coca-cola he wants a piece of the pie he could he could share
[01:39:31.200 --> 01:39:35.920]  the nobel peace prize if he gets something done and if he moves uh in a peaceful direction and
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:41.040]  exactly and the globalists wanted to keep tension and fighting going forever to sell weapons trump
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:44.800]  goes i'll sell weapons to japan and south korea and the north we're not going to use the damn
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:49.600]  things you're going to be making big screen tv's north korea exactly you can tell though
[01:39:49.600 --> 01:39:54.560]  the globalists are panicking their strategy of crisis is coming to an end give but let's not
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:57.920]  start getting too confident when you come back you host you're going to cover whatever you want
[01:39:57.920 --> 01:40:01.360]  the last segment roger because i respect you want to give me a time here you got a big night
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:05.040]  head up you know turn down that hot blonde night or hot brunette or whatever your beautiful wife
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:10.880]  brunette the point is is that we're sitting here looking at this what's the six what's the jack
[01:40:10.880 --> 01:40:15.360]  what's the threat what do we got to look for let's not start getting too confident here
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:20.160]  even though it looks like total victories within grasp well in all in all honesty i i think that
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:25.520]  we face the greatest challenge we ever faced the hysteria of the deep state is ratcheting up this
[01:40:25.520 --> 01:40:32.480]  just moves mr muller into high gear uh and uh trying to make something of the michael kohn
[01:40:32.480 --> 01:40:39.520]  affair the details of which are still not clear but somehow figure out a way to euker that into
[01:40:39.520 --> 01:40:46.480]  testimony against donald trump uh the uh increasing scouring of the earth for russian
[01:40:46.480 --> 01:40:55.360]  collusion where none can be found uh the tactics uh being used by mr muller their refusal to turn
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:41:02.160]  over to the executive branch the information and documents pertaining to the illegal surveillance
[01:41:02.160 --> 01:41:07.360]  of the trump campaign the liberals want to talk about a constitutional crisis there it is i was
[01:41:07.360 --> 01:41:13.040]  about to say we were in dc together last year when the front page of the new york times said
[01:41:13.040 --> 01:41:17.280]  trump was surveilled we already knew that a week later they said we never said that now they've
[01:41:17.280 --> 01:41:23.280]  been proven to be liars and now it's all come out that that that brennan and comey and muller
[01:41:23.280 --> 01:41:29.600]  lied to congress these guys are sitting ducks except you've got that that that that attorney
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:37.280]  general who i think they caught the word is a kkk outfit well something he's either

[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:23.920]  it was a great patriot who gets demonized a lot uh but who's the real deal the real mccoy
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:29.680]  and the fact that i know even his background well he helped get a bunch of communists arrested
[01:47:29.680 --> 01:47:34.640]  in the eighties for reagan and working for nixon right through the way he's been demonized it's
[01:47:34.640 --> 01:47:41.760]  because he's pro america and they're claimed that i'm a russian agent info wars rebooted the country
[01:47:41.760 --> 01:47:46.720]  with you the listeners you rebooted the country we're the people that support the bill of rights
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:51.760]  the second amendment the sovereignty not only criticism of trump is he's kicking the hell out
[01:47:51.760 --> 01:47:57.680]  of russia with sanctions beyond anything obama or anybody ever did and mass and troops on their
[01:47:57.680 --> 01:48:02.320]  border and just uh i liked the fact that he did the energy policies that are good for america but
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:12.400]  man god that hurt russia bad so be it but it's just sick when the communist shinies are on record
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:18.960]  running hollywood they now own it running our media padama can now most universities
[01:48:19.680 --> 01:48:23.360]  enslaveing their own people and then they pointed us and say we're the traders that's
[01:48:23.360 --> 01:48:27.840]  ridiculous we got nine and a half minutes left roger i'll be here at the end i'm here watching
[01:48:27.840 --> 01:48:31.600]  you live right now but i want you to have the floor here so interrupted just give people a
[01:48:31.600 --> 01:48:37.280]  state of the union address the point we're at right now at a real historic crossroads where the
[01:48:37.280 --> 01:48:41.840]  people really count what they say and do roger stone the globalists are desperate they're losing
[01:48:41.840 --> 01:48:45.680]  but they're going to strike back what do you see in your crystal ball what are your sources tell you
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:53.360]  Alex the stage is set for an epic clash and it's time sensitive and here is why
[01:48:54.400 --> 01:49:00.400]  robert mewler is stepping up the pressure to remove this president in what i have described
[01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:08.320]  as a deep state coup the president's lawyers to review his initial lawyers lulled him into a false
[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:15.040]  sense of complacency and confidence that the inquiry would literally just go away
[01:49:15.040 --> 01:49:20.480]  they promised him a letter from the special counsel by christmas that it was new year's
[01:49:20.480 --> 01:49:27.120]  then it was the end of january now it's may and no letter is forthcoming the list of questions
[01:49:27.120 --> 01:49:33.200]  published in the new york times on page one that mr moeller wants to ask the president
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:39.920]  strip bear any facade that this is about russia and quite clearly the president has been jolted
[01:49:39.920 --> 01:49:46.240]  by the fact that they want to look into every aspect of his career and his executive actions
[01:49:46.240 --> 01:49:53.280]  including the depositions of his children uh the president signaled a change by bringing in
[01:49:53.840 --> 01:50:01.600]  mayor juliani now he has clearly suffered some slings and arrows for some of his comments regarding
[01:50:01.600 --> 01:50:08.720]  the sideshow of stormy daniels but on the key question of comey moeller and the illegitimacy
[01:50:08.720 --> 01:50:18.080]  and outrageousness of this inquiry this inquisition to remove the president he has been most effective
[01:50:18.080 --> 01:50:24.400]  more importantly i believe that he is urging the president to do what he should have done some time
[01:50:24.400 --> 01:50:32.400]  ago and take dramatic action by terminating some of the bad actors in this drama now the reason
[01:50:32.400 --> 01:50:39.520]  that he must move quickly is because the u.s senate is racing to legally protect robert moeller
[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:46.960]  the special counsel from being terminated uh the constitutionality of that has to be questionable
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:54.160]  mr moeller doesn't even answer to a three judge panel uh as he would have to under the old uh
[01:50:54.960 --> 01:51:01.840]  special counsel law which has expired he merely has mr rozenstein rubber stamping
[01:51:01.840 --> 01:51:10.400]  his rampage into any area he wishes to pursue uh and he is i think grasping at straws having come
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:19.520]  up with no russian payday he is forced to go back to the questions of mr comey and mr sessions uh
[01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:26.640]  comey's uh termination and the threats to terminate sessions now in view of the fact
[01:51:26.640 --> 01:51:34.240]  that both the republican and democratic justice department have both ruled that a sitting president
[01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:43.760]  cannot be indicted for a crime while in office what can be the purpose of this inquiry other than uh
[01:51:43.760 --> 01:51:50.560]  to remove the president to undo what they could not do at the ballot box i think the president
[01:51:50.560 --> 01:51:58.960]  now realizes the danger that is afoot i think the president understands the power that he has
[01:51:58.960 --> 01:52:07.840]  but he must move on them before they move on him uh he has the power to pardon everyone uh who's
[01:52:07.840 --> 01:52:15.840]  currently been indicted he has the power to terminate uh mr sessions uh and mr rozenstein
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:22.640]  he has the power to order the appointment of a special prosecutor uh i'm both a fisa warrants
[01:52:22.640 --> 01:52:29.360]  where the justice department is stonewalling chairman nunez hiding the ball in an unconstitutional
[01:52:30.160 --> 01:52:38.400]  game of keep away uh he has the authority to uh deal a solid blow to those who move closer and
[01:52:38.400 --> 01:52:47.200]  closer to removing him on some bogus trumped up charge uh in the meantime i can tell you that the
[01:52:47.200 --> 01:52:53.920]  senate uh announced last week or it was i should say it was leaked that sam nunberg has been asked
[01:52:53.920 --> 01:53:02.080]  to provide all emails between he and i that pertain to ubat uh wiki leaks julie insange
[01:53:02.080 --> 01:53:09.120]  russia goose for 2.0 nothing in these emails that concerns me mr nunberg is the gift that
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:14.320]  keeps on giving and roger let me just jump in briefly here because i'm sitting here watching
[01:53:14.320 --> 01:53:18.880]  you you're absolutely on target and today before we went on air i thought get on the
[01:53:18.880 --> 01:53:24.400]  offense alex you're always covering what they do we're trying to bring back jobs thousands of factories
[01:53:24.400 --> 01:53:34.480]  trump 24 billion in black um uh african-american targeted you know direct scholarships and and
[01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:38.480]  the left's going oh that's racist it should be for everybody that's more than 50 years of black
[01:53:38.480 --> 01:53:44.560]  scholarships in in four years he's he's already signed the order i mean i mean here's the deal i
[01:53:44.560 --> 01:53:49.600]  totally agree with that don't take somebody else's college slot because they're asian or white or a
[01:53:49.600 --> 01:53:55.520]  woman give somebody a damn scholarship i'm all about paying tax money for that i like that idea
[01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:59.680]  of actually like here you know boom you did good in school or whatever you tried
[01:53:59.680 --> 01:54:05.920]  you get this i mean he's doing so good and then i see all these attacks it makes me sick do we
[01:54:05.920 --> 01:54:11.520]  forget that donald trump i know i'm changing subjects here do we forget donald trump 40 years
[01:54:11.520 --> 01:54:16.160]  ago bought a bunch of golf courses at blacks and jews and hispanics i i didn't believe that when i
[01:54:16.160 --> 01:54:21.280]  was like four years old people couldn't play golf anywhere they wanted but there were still golf courses
[01:54:21.280 --> 01:54:27.040]  uh you know like bushwood from the imaginary caddy shack where blacks and hispanics and gays
[01:54:27.040 --> 01:54:32.720]  and jews couldn't play and trump is the guy that bought dozens and did that and then that's
[01:54:32.720 --> 01:54:37.200]  why all the rappers loved him because and then they turn around like cowards like snoop dog
[01:54:37.200 --> 01:54:42.320]  and crap all over him that pisses me off that i have the real white supremacist against me
[01:54:42.320 --> 01:54:46.240]  because i've been for real inclusion as a libertarian for years and there's this secret
[01:54:46.240 --> 01:54:51.760]  conservatism of racism that plays into the left i'm done with the blue bloods i'm done i was never
[01:54:51.760 --> 01:54:55.840]  with them but i'm done with the blue bloods i'm done with everybody but that doesn't mean that
[01:54:55.840 --> 01:55:00.240]  i look at black racists or hispanic racists who tell me to kiss their butt because i'm white
[01:55:00.240 --> 01:55:06.400]  no you go to hell too does that make sense makes perfect says look you can go on youtube now and
[01:55:06.400 --> 01:55:12.640]  find footage of jesse jackson praising donald trump for his work in the community donald trump is
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:18.480]  not a racist uh this is the name calling are we ever going to drop the secret weapon on him about
[01:55:18.480 --> 01:55:30.640]  trump uh you might i'm not going to let's just say donald trump likes black people yeah he loves
[01:55:30.640 --> 01:55:37.280]  black people uh look but they'll turn into something like thomas jefferson's bad well you know the left
[01:55:37.280 --> 01:55:43.760]  is very interesting when uh when bill clinton engages in in uh oral sex in the oval office with
[01:55:44.400 --> 01:55:48.880]  inter and they say that's not of anybody's business that's personal conduct yet they're
[01:55:48.880 --> 01:55:54.560]  wild about stormy daniels which if anything happened it was consensual but if the president
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:56:01.920]  had a black supermodel girlfriend 30 years ago that's that's racist uh well be racist for us
[01:56:01.920 --> 01:56:07.360]  to say that problem well i'm not saying it i've heard that though people are saying it
[01:56:09.440 --> 01:56:14.000]  oh my god well you know talking to trump you know a lot better than me 40 something years
[01:56:14.000 --> 01:56:18.720]  he talks about energy so in closing what is this thing with trump at energy conye talked about
[01:56:18.720 --> 01:56:22.560]  dragon energy trump said we get the energy when i've talked to trump a few times i've talked to him
[01:56:22.560 --> 01:56:26.400]  you know ten times or something he talked to a thousand times he talks about energy he really
[01:56:26.400 --> 01:56:32.880]  he loves black churches what's going on there uh you know he is not a man who is uh who likes to
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:38.240]  be bored he's constantly on the move he likes to see things moving he likes uh you know he likes
[01:56:38.240 --> 01:56:43.600]  upbeat people but it's not an ass-kissing event he really likes black people i think he likes
[01:56:43.600 --> 01:56:47.440]  everybody this is the difference fundamental difference between he and hillary clinton donald
[01:56:47.440 --> 01:56:53.280]  from loves people well you heard him say you heard him say i want victory for the planet he can talk
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:59.680]  to anybody easily uh i know personally when he heard obama five years ago say africa can't
[01:56:59.680 --> 01:57:04.720]  have air conditioning he stood up in his chair when he heard that yes i've heard that as well
[01:57:06.160 --> 01:57:08.720]  how racist is that to say black people can't have anything

[01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:10.320]  uk cnn and many others are calling for info wars to be shut down taken off the web slate magazine
