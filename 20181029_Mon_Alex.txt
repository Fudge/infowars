[00:00.000 --> 00:16.400]  Eight days, eight days, you can cut the energy in the air from enemies, foreign and domestic.
[00:16.400 --> 00:17.880]  It's Alex Jones.
[00:17.880 --> 00:22.840]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen, watching America Six standing up against enemies,
[00:22.840 --> 00:24.480]  foreign and domestic.
[00:24.480 --> 00:26.160]  I am your host, Alex Jones.
[00:26.160 --> 00:28.440]  We're going to be here for the next four hours.
[00:28.440 --> 00:30.520]  Very special guest host in the fourth hour.
[00:30.520 --> 00:36.600]  And then, Owen Schreuer, Roger Shunner and others with the War Room.
[00:36.600 --> 00:41.400]  David Knight has concluded the David Knight Show, 8 a.m. to 11 a.m. weekdays, right here
[00:41.400 --> 00:44.920]  at the M4 Wars, radio, TV, internet, network.
[00:44.920 --> 00:49.600]  That is the most hated, the most demonized, the most lied about broadcast in the world
[00:49.600 --> 00:57.400]  because we know what we're talking about and we support sovereign, successful, Western,
[00:57.400 --> 01:02.760]  capitalist ideas.
[01:02.760 --> 01:03.760]  Trump has come out.
[01:03.760 --> 01:04.920]  Look at drudgerport.com.
[01:04.920 --> 01:08.760]  Trump blast media for blood, stoking great anger, true enemy of the people.
[01:08.760 --> 01:15.680]  I love the doubling down because it's the corporate media that is everywhere saying attack Trump
[01:15.680 --> 01:20.880]  supporters, kill Trump, Trump's a Nazi, everyone's a Nazi.
[01:20.880 --> 01:25.640]  During all this crap up, and then when Trump talks back to them and says they're liars,
[01:25.640 --> 01:29.400]  they go, oh, you're going to cause violence to us.
[01:29.400 --> 01:33.360]  And then right on time it appears in the last two weeks before the election.
[01:33.360 --> 01:34.360]  Very transparent.
[01:34.360 --> 01:40.320]  There's some serious chicanery, skull-duggery going on here.
[01:40.320 --> 01:49.000]  Meanwhile, the big news, all over the world, every election goes for a nationalist.
[01:49.000 --> 01:57.240]  And you didn't just have the tropical Trump who was just elected, who wants a constitution
[01:57.240 --> 01:58.240]  like ours.
[01:58.240 --> 02:07.520]  He says we'll follow the Bible and the U.S. Constitution.
[02:07.520 --> 02:20.200]  So the Trump of the tropics, Bolsonaro, after being stabbed, just a few months ago and almost
[02:20.200 --> 02:26.280]  dying, stabbed in public, he was in the lead then and obviously he won.
[02:26.280 --> 02:30.840]  And they're very, very happy and he wants to bring in the U.S. Constitution tailored
[02:30.840 --> 02:31.840]  for Brazil.
[02:31.840 --> 02:32.840]  He wants a second amendment.
[02:32.840 --> 02:39.080]  He said the Constitution, the Bible, will guide us and he wants Brazil first.
[02:39.080 --> 02:44.040]  And he says no more big cartels, controlling all the resources and not letting the people
[02:44.040 --> 02:46.040]  have resources through privatization.
[02:46.040 --> 02:50.400]  We're doing it and we're doing it now, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:50.400 --> 02:54.560]  Oh, something else happened too that I forgot about.
[02:54.560 --> 03:00.200]  They have a parliamentary system in Germany, in Deutschland, so it's very hard to ever
[03:00.200 --> 03:02.960]  get the socialists out.
[03:02.960 --> 03:06.720]  The globalists out because they always stay in government power because they can buy off
[03:06.720 --> 03:10.120]  another party even if their party loses seats.
[03:10.120 --> 03:15.160]  Well, finally, Merkel has lost all the state elections, all the federal elections for six
[03:15.160 --> 03:16.160]  years.
[03:16.160 --> 03:22.560]  The globalists tried to prop her up as the god of the planet and now she's out.
[03:22.560 --> 03:29.080]  She's still in office as the chancellor, but her party is out of power and she stepped
[03:29.080 --> 03:31.760]  down as the head of the CDU.
[03:31.760 --> 03:39.480]  So for all intents and purposes, she is out of power because her party is out of power,
[03:39.480 --> 03:41.000]  but she's still serving out her term.
[03:41.000 --> 03:43.960]  A lot of times people are asked to step down and hold early elections.
[03:43.960 --> 03:45.640]  She should do that.
[03:45.640 --> 03:48.520]  Let's see, how's that for your globalism?
[03:48.520 --> 03:55.880]  From Italy to Brazil to the UK to the United States to Germany.
[03:55.880 --> 04:00.720]  People are voting out globalist candidates, Japan, you name it.
[04:00.720 --> 04:06.480]  Just like Michael Cain said a few weeks ago, he said he's for Brexit, and they said, why?
[04:06.480 --> 04:10.560]  And he said, this is an unelected bureaucracy of people that I don't even know, that don't
[04:10.560 --> 04:13.880]  even speak English, that are over us.
[04:13.880 --> 04:17.360]  That's just fundamentally not right.
[04:17.360 --> 04:19.120]  So let them engage in economic terrorism.
[04:19.120 --> 04:22.160]  That makes me want to pull out more, that they're threatening us.
[04:22.160 --> 04:27.440]  We didn't ever vote to be under this, and then the leftist media attacks him as a rich
[04:27.440 --> 04:28.440]  guy.
[04:28.440 --> 04:33.520]  They use class warfare, but it's the real rich, the globalist billionaires that engineered
[04:33.520 --> 04:35.040]  the whole EU show.
[04:35.040 --> 04:40.440]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run, and globalism, the unelected evil corporate
[04:40.440 --> 04:46.880]  tyranny that works for the time is China, is on the run and in massive collapse worldwide.
[04:46.880 --> 04:52.120]  But hark, my friends, the warning, the globalists are now beavering away to start a war.
[04:52.120 --> 05:00.760]  The war between the US and Russia will be right back, stay with us.
[05:00.760 --> 05:05.960]  Words cannot describe how big the stakes are for the future of humanity right now.
[05:05.960 --> 05:10.400]  InfoWords is being openly targeted by the Democratic Party, leftist CIA operatives, the corrupt
[05:10.400 --> 05:14.560]  justice department, and the entire Soros crime syndicate.
[05:14.560 --> 05:16.560]  People say, why would you start a fight with them?
[05:16.560 --> 05:20.600]  Because they were already dominating and running America into the ground, and I knew we had
[05:20.600 --> 05:22.200]  no future if we didn't do this.
[05:22.200 --> 05:24.840]  So we've already had incredible success.
[05:24.840 --> 05:29.600]  But if you will simply realize how epic this is, and understand how real this fight is
[05:29.600 --> 05:34.240]  and why we've been made the main target, and if you financially support us, and if you
[05:34.240 --> 05:39.840]  spread the word about our articles and videos, infowars.com, we won't just continue to stand
[05:39.840 --> 05:43.280]  up against these brutal scumbags, we'll win.
[05:43.280 --> 05:47.880]  We have huge sales at infowars.com right now, and we're still able to operate the shopping
[05:47.880 --> 05:51.360]  cart and get stuff shipped out to you, despite the fact you're trying to block our commerce
[05:51.360 --> 05:53.320]  and you're right to the market.
[05:53.320 --> 05:57.000]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Soros and the Globalist may win.
[05:57.000 --> 06:09.280]  This is InfoWars Darker Tower, we're your support, I'm counting on you.
[06:09.280 --> 06:15.840]  The United States is under globalist sage, but we're fighting back.
[06:15.840 --> 06:24.280]  Val Senaro, the Trump of South America who says his Bible is the Bible and the U.S. Constitution
[06:24.280 --> 06:35.280]  is now been trumpedly elected by a landslide in Brazil 1776 worldwide, continues with the
[06:35.280 --> 06:42.720]  fall of Merkel and her party now out of power in Deutschland.
[06:42.720 --> 06:49.760]  They're striking blow, and all of this, the Brexit, the elections in Italy and other places
[06:49.760 --> 06:54.160]  around the world, everywhere in every election, the globalists are out, populists are in,
[06:54.160 --> 07:04.320]  all is a portent, a symbol, a sign, a bellwether, that there will be a crushing red wave in
[07:04.320 --> 07:09.200]  T-minus eight days and counting down.
[07:09.200 --> 07:15.360]  Now, can their blue wave of fraud and people voting in the names of dead people or illegal
[07:15.360 --> 07:21.920]  aliens voting in many areas legally now, can that be stopped?
[07:21.920 --> 07:27.040]  That's the big question, ladies and gentlemen, because the globalists are making their final
[07:27.040 --> 07:36.240]  stand, their final stand here in the United States to set up a culturally, racially, religiously
[07:36.240 --> 07:42.560]  divided nation as a model for the rest of the planet where even the family isn't tolerated.
[07:42.560 --> 07:53.240]  No Christianity is tolerated, and radical Islam is the prevailing overriding system of control.
[07:53.240 --> 08:00.000]  Ahead of this election, though, we've seen GAB.com, the only independent social media
[08:00.000 --> 08:06.640]  system in the world, not basically based in San Francisco, and not vehemently anti-free
[08:06.640 --> 08:11.040]  speech, and they have had their servers taken, their domain registered taken, their payment
[08:11.040 --> 08:13.320]  systems taken, and they are shut down.
[08:13.320 --> 08:20.960]  Let's go to GAB.com on screen for TV viewers, and there is a message there.
[08:20.960 --> 08:30.680]  We have Andrew Torba who joined me yesterday exclusively, joining us in the third hour today.
[08:30.680 --> 08:34.880]  Now the monster that reportedly shot up the Jewish center who is still alive and killed
[08:34.880 --> 08:47.080]  11, including four police, he wounded two others, six wounded total, he said, four minutes
[08:47.080 --> 08:51.720]  before he went in there, I'm going in, screw your optics, I'm going in.
[08:51.720 --> 08:57.400]  That would probably get the police called normally to come check it out, but four minutes
[08:57.400 --> 09:03.000]  before, you don't know what somebody's saying on a message board on a system like that.
[09:03.000 --> 09:08.840]  So the idea that you've got to have prior constraint and can't let people who are extreme
[09:08.840 --> 09:15.320]  right-wing or racist have a place anywhere is only going to cause a larger pressure cooker
[09:15.320 --> 09:17.480]  and an explosion.
[09:17.480 --> 09:22.840]  And then you add to that that Facebook and Twitter allow the most vicious leftist groups
[09:22.840 --> 09:27.880]  to organize millions of followers on Twitter especially, run by an NYC professor and others
[09:27.880 --> 09:32.600]  that say, kill Trump, kill his family, kill Mike Pence, kill him at restaurants, kill
[09:32.600 --> 09:34.840]  cops, just randomly kill cops.
[09:34.840 --> 09:36.440]  What I want for Christmas is dead cops.
[09:36.440 --> 09:42.160]  I mean, there's hundreds of these professors, they lead it, and they're led by the weather
[09:42.160 --> 09:45.840]  underground former heads and others.
[09:45.840 --> 09:50.680]  And they're out there calling for violence everywhere and having op-ed pieces about how
[09:50.680 --> 09:55.280]  Trump needs to be killed the New York Times and the Washington Post.
[09:55.280 --> 09:58.920]  And everywhere else on my head spins, we've even tried to categorize all the death-threading
[09:58.920 --> 10:03.640]  and murder-threading and violence and shootings and stabbings and hitting the head with bike
[10:03.640 --> 10:09.880]  locks and fire bombings and vandalization and ribs being broken of Senator Paul and
[10:09.880 --> 10:17.760]  coffee, hot coffee dumped on my head and Fox News has chased to the streets of New York.
[10:17.760 --> 10:25.680]  And then the corporate media has the nerve, the guts, to come out and say President Trump
[10:25.680 --> 10:38.320]  wants violence, to come out and say that President Trump
[10:38.320 --> 10:42.120]  is the one pushing all this and instead of Trump apologizing and groveling and rolling
[10:42.120 --> 10:45.240]  over on his back like a dog, what's he say?
[10:45.240 --> 10:51.200]  Trump blames media for blood, stoking great anger, true enemy of the people.
[10:51.200 --> 10:59.480]  And he's talking about corporate, lying media when they say he's a Nazi.
[10:59.480 --> 11:05.080]  Now he was having kids over for a Halloween trick-or-treat type party and one of them
[11:05.080 --> 11:10.160]  had a Moses stick, you know, the stick that turns into the serpent that he waves in front
[11:10.160 --> 11:12.680]  of Pharaoh and Trump got it and waved it in front of the media.
[11:12.680 --> 11:20.200]  We're going to play that in a moment, but they really are engaged in psychological warfare.
[11:20.200 --> 11:22.680]  They really are trying to divide us.
[11:22.680 --> 11:30.800]  I mean, look at this article out of Italy from Paul Joseph Watson at newswars.com.
[11:30.800 --> 11:36.800]  Italy, feminist protest all men, that's a quote, after a 16-year-old girl raped and murdered
[11:36.800 --> 11:41.120]  by migrants.
[11:41.120 --> 11:44.920]  They called racist for making the issue about immigration.
[11:44.920 --> 11:45.920]  That's the president.
[11:45.920 --> 11:46.920]  It's a nationalist.
[11:46.920 --> 11:50.680]  Feminists responded, you mean anti-family, anti-woman folks, responded to the sickening
[11:50.680 --> 11:58.080]  gang rape and murder, murder of a 16-year-old Italian girl by three illegal African migrants
[11:58.080 --> 12:02.960]  by protesting it's all men and they say the president's bad because he's pro-family.
[12:02.960 --> 12:06.840]  Yes, having men around to protect their wives and daughters, that's bad.
[12:06.840 --> 12:11.400]  And you get a bunch of airhead liberal women out there protesting the president that's
[12:11.400 --> 12:15.440]  trying to stop the totally open borders and protect them.
[12:15.440 --> 12:20.640]  They're saying, there's a video, it's in Italian, they're saying that that's what's
[12:20.640 --> 12:23.120]  bad.
[12:23.120 --> 12:28.000]  That's how whacked out these people are and they're all on the Soros payroll.
[12:28.000 --> 12:30.040]  Anything of that.
[12:30.040 --> 12:35.920]  Lou Dobbs had a segment Thursday, didn't get the attention, it reared.
[12:35.920 --> 12:41.000]  I guess on regular Fox on Saturday and Soros had Twitter go out and do harassment campaign
[12:41.000 --> 12:42.000]  against Lou Dobbs.
[12:42.000 --> 12:45.880]  They're talking about firing Lou Dobbs and they permanently banned the guest who's the
[12:45.880 --> 12:50.760]  head of judicial watch on who got the documents months ago that we've been showing you and
[12:50.760 --> 12:57.640]  covering on air where specifically three of the four groups are funded by Soros.
[12:57.640 --> 13:04.240]  The Vatican, USAID, money we give to the UN gets given to Soros and to the Vatican to
[13:04.240 --> 13:07.160]  build these refugee camps and stage the people.
[13:07.160 --> 13:08.760]  That's a fact.
[13:08.760 --> 13:18.120]  And because judicial watch said they're having criminal investigations in Honduras and in
[13:18.120 --> 13:22.440]  other areas of Central America like Guatemala that the Justice Department needs to criminally
[13:22.440 --> 13:26.800]  investigate it because there's child trafficking going on which is confirmed and they're organizing
[13:26.800 --> 13:30.600]  crime and smuggling children and many children have gone into sex slavery even Washington
[13:30.600 --> 13:35.520]  Post admits it's totally true.
[13:35.520 --> 13:42.280]  But we can't have that ladies and gentlemen why any criticism of Soros he's a Holocaust
[13:42.280 --> 13:47.320]  survivor you know he helped run the Holocaust admitted on 60 minutes and so you can't criticize
[13:47.320 --> 13:53.600]  him and so Lou Dobbs is in trouble because see everyone must shut up and let that war
[13:53.600 --> 13:57.840]  criminal George Soros has overthrown all these countries and tried to kill the dollar and
[13:57.840 --> 14:04.040]  kill the pound and all the bad things he's done we're supposed to bow down to him we're
[14:04.040 --> 14:09.520]  supposed to grovel to this and notice they put all their pressure first it's me and then
[14:09.520 --> 14:16.200]  it's I told you they're going for Lou Dobbs and Matt Drudge and Tucker Carlson next and
[14:16.200 --> 14:20.200]  Sean Hannity and they are and they're harassing their sponsors and they're instead of conservatives
[14:20.200 --> 14:25.520]  sticking together we all just kind of let each other get picked off one after the other
[14:25.520 --> 14:29.120]  till they get it solved but I don't do that I stood up for Limbaugh I tried to get him
[14:29.120 --> 14:33.040]  off air for no reason I stand up for Drudge report I stand up for Tucker Carlson I stand
[14:33.040 --> 14:37.400]  up for Lou Dobbs because they're good people and they're telling the truth and that's why
[14:37.400 --> 14:41.000]  they're being lied about that's why they're being misrepresented you notice all the headlines
[14:41.000 --> 14:46.280]  are Lou Dobbs in trouble show removed from the air that the episode he said horrible lies
[14:46.280 --> 14:56.040]  about George Soros but they never tell you what it is that he said we're going to play
[14:56.040 --> 14:59.120]  the segment I don't normally air something twice in a row I played it last night on the
[14:59.120 --> 15:06.120]  Sunday show we're going to play it when we come back and show the judicial watch documents
[15:06.120 --> 15:10.960]  that they got from the federal government that show George Soros is funding of course
[15:10.960 --> 15:16.720]  he funds it he's the biggest political donor in the world his whole program is get rid of
[15:16.720 --> 15:23.520]  borders that's what he wants here's the sick part a he uses our taxpayer money through
[15:23.520 --> 15:28.760]  USA and through the UN that we give the UN cut it off that's number one number two it's
[15:28.760 --> 15:33.000]  illegal to organize people and so they can come across transnational borders with a bunch
[15:33.000 --> 15:37.440]  of little children and no identification and a bunch of known criminals in there committing
[15:37.440 --> 15:42.400]  crimes attacking police so yes it's organized racketeering crime just like they try to shut
[15:42.400 --> 15:47.440]  down independent media just like they try to bully people these are mafia criminal modern
[15:47.440 --> 15:54.600]  brown shirts that must be met with strength not bowing down to these sickening evil anti-american
[15:54.600 --> 16:01.560]  cancers we'll be back stay with us most of you know that heart disease is the number one
[16:01.560 --> 16:06.720]  silent killer in the US what if I told you for just 54 95 a month you could fight against
[16:06.720 --> 16:11.400]  heart disease naturally at heart and body extract we've been helping thousands of people
[16:11.400 --> 16:15.600]  get back to a healthier heart don't just take my word for it check out all of the success
[16:15.600 --> 16:26.080]  stories at HB extract dot com or to order call 866 295 5305 that's 866 295 5305 HB extract
[16:26.080 --> 16:31.000]  dot com don't risk it when you can take charge of it in these uncertain times it makes sense

[20:39.720 --> 20:45.000]  corporate media from cnn msnbc saying take ludobs off the air they say they've banned
[20:45.640 --> 20:52.760]  off fox news the head of judicial watch totally respected law firm public interest that sues
[20:52.760 --> 20:58.360]  and gets documents because they went on and said there's criminal investigations in honduras and
[20:58.360 --> 21:04.680]  guatemala they say criminal activities are being carried out by these NGO foundations that get us
[21:04.680 --> 21:11.800]  taxpayer money and un money which is also taxpayer money given to them and then soros and others
[21:11.800 --> 21:17.640]  handed out and i'm gonna go over the very names here in a moment but this is a invasion our military
[21:17.640 --> 21:23.720]  is waiting for you trump warren's migrant caravan vice president pence has come out and said leftist
[21:23.720 --> 21:29.160]  groups are funding this of course they are the most important article to read about this is from
[21:29.160 --> 21:38.200]  world net daily it has direct links to judicial watch we've written about as well the headline is
[21:38.200 --> 21:47.880]  border caravan call it the george soros express and then they go through all the groups three of the
[21:47.880 --> 21:53.480]  four mainly funded by george soros but that's a lie because he gets the money from the un
[21:53.480 --> 22:01.400]  that gets it from you and i the mccarthur foundation the carnegie corporation care the open
[22:04.360 --> 22:13.320]  society foundation that's soros and he funds all of them okay so notice everywhere it's
[22:13.320 --> 22:18.840]  lou dobbs did something horrible lou dobbs did something hateful lou dobbs he talked about george
[22:18.840 --> 22:23.800]  soros and george soros got a fake pipe bomb in the mail he's a public figure a war criminal
[22:23.800 --> 22:29.800]  hated all over the world shetty was a nazi collaborator on 60 minutes and in pr but they
[22:29.800 --> 22:35.400]  don't say any of that they just say lou dobbs did mean things to george soros he said some terrible
[22:35.400 --> 22:43.560]  lies and twitter the the leftist brigades bullied news corps and bullied fox news and so they said
[22:43.560 --> 22:52.120]  we're so sorry we may fire lou dobbs fox business pulls lou dobbs episode after guest soros remarks
[22:53.000 --> 22:56.920]  oh my goodness and what were those remarks well you know read the articles they don't tell you so
[22:58.440 --> 23:01.800]  here's what everybody to do this is not a spectator broadcast i know you know that
[23:01.800 --> 23:06.920]  that's why they hate info wars news wars dot com is our newer cleaner site we're redesigning info
[23:06.920 --> 23:12.200]  wars as well we have prison planet dot com but now let's censor it off all the other systems
[23:12.200 --> 23:17.320]  because we're so effective telling the truth and and relaunching 1776 worldwide as you see
[23:17.320 --> 23:25.240]  that operation that we first introduced to the world 12 years ago is now winning in germany and
[23:25.240 --> 23:30.920]  everywhere else and in brazil just just today in brazil and germany just two giant victories today
[23:31.560 --> 23:36.360]  so they admit in the globalist councils and it's even come out that they have breakaway groups in
[23:36.360 --> 23:45.400]  the cia that obama put in mainly trying to target me because i've got their number and i believe
[23:45.400 --> 23:50.120]  americana is sexier than tyranny and i believe everybody wants it and we need a military to
[23:50.120 --> 23:56.520]  enforce it but you gotta have it and the globalists can't compete with the american system they've
[23:56.520 --> 24:02.040]  been saying that for 200 years the british empire couldn't compete with it show here is the censored
[24:02.040 --> 24:07.960]  report and again soros is openly involved in all this trafficking they're openly involved in
[24:07.960 --> 24:11.480]  children being smuggled across they're openly that's in the news today that that's happening
[24:11.480 --> 24:16.120]  and people are being found dead and it's horribly dangerous and it's illegal and these NGOs are
[24:16.120 --> 24:20.840]  taking money to traffic people illegally something hillary's top people have been caught and gone
[24:20.840 --> 24:27.400]  to prison for doing smuggling kids out of Haiti and so he says this is criminal trump should
[24:27.400 --> 24:32.680]  criminally investigate it no you don't investigate soros and it's open naked criminal activity
[24:33.240 --> 24:40.440]  no no no no no so go to news wars dot com it doesn't get as censored as much as info wars on
[24:40.440 --> 24:45.960]  twitter and facebook other places it's and it's got the full article must watch censored ludob's
[24:45.960 --> 24:54.680]  judicial watch report on migrant caravan funding and other banned videos like andrew torby yesterday
[24:54.680 --> 25:02.120]  this is powerful i'm going to send it out at to the info wars newsletter the article send it forward
[25:02.120 --> 25:09.800]  this is the opposite of spam this is totally critical so let's go to the banned report that they
[25:09.800 --> 25:14.280]  don't want you to see that they don't want you to share here is ludob's in trouble for telling the
[25:14.280 --> 25:19.480]  truth van just north of the Honduran border joining us tonight chris farrell director of
[25:19.480 --> 25:26.760]  investigations for judicial watch chris good to have you with us i know that uh this caravan was
[25:26.760 --> 25:31.640]  a subject of considerable interest for you for judicial watch and certainly for the american
[25:31.640 --> 25:36.920]  people give us your first and i'm going to because we have limited time i ask you to be as succinct
[25:36.920 --> 25:43.160]  as possible your thoughts on what you witness and what you saw and heard it's an overwhelmingly male
[25:43.160 --> 25:49.560]  caravan of mid teens to mid 40s uh i'd say the women and children are super minority there are
[25:49.560 --> 25:54.520]  certainly criminal elements rolled into the caravan and there were children that were recovered
[25:54.520 --> 26:00.680]  from a human smuggling operation today uh the guatemalan's are trying to hold them back and
[26:00.680 --> 26:07.800]  turn them back but it's a very grave situation leftist groups uh reported to be uh the organizers
[26:07.800 --> 26:14.040]  playing instrumental roles and financial roles uh tell us what you can sure uh look this is a
[26:14.040 --> 26:18.600]  criminal involvement on the part of these leftist groups it's highly organized very elaborate
[26:18.600 --> 26:23.880]  sophisticated operation i have that from the highest levels of the guatemalan government
[26:23.880 --> 26:28.520]  they're investigating those groups criminally and i strongly urge president trump and attorney
[26:28.520 --> 26:34.040]  journal sessions to do the same here a lot of these folks also have affiliates who are getting money
[26:34.040 --> 26:38.680]  from the soros occupied state department and that is a very great concern when you start
[26:38.680 --> 26:43.720]  cutting money start cutting money there do you know anything about what we're seeing in that's
[26:43.720 --> 26:52.280]  reports and pictures of us a id uh packages bags uh containing what we know not but obviously
[26:52.280 --> 26:58.760]  distributed by us a id uh what is what is behind that i don't have a clear answer off the top of
[26:58.760 --> 27:03.400]  my head i can just tell you that there's all sorts of programs that these groups are affiliated with
[27:03.400 --> 27:10.760]  that we spend taxpayer money on it needs to be cut off now and uh where are we headed uh we have
[27:10.760 --> 27:16.280]  another caravan uh of a thousand or more people let's stop right there more coming up but but
[27:16.280 --> 27:19.800]  here's the key to everything i'll play more of it coming up but here's the key to everything
[27:21.480 --> 27:24.920]  you have to share the article at info wars dot com and news wars dot com you have to share it
[27:25.560 --> 27:31.800]  and the key to this is what did i say the last two weeks about the caravan cut the funding and they
[27:31.800 --> 27:37.640]  had the trolls going what it's because the left poses is anti-semites all over info wars was oh
[27:37.640 --> 27:45.800]  you're covering up for the jews the un's not involved and then we could go look at the ip
[27:45.800 --> 27:50.520]  addresses and things it was a hundred percent leftist see so so so they changed the subject
[27:50.520 --> 27:55.000]  over to that because we can just go in and cut the funding to the un and that's the funding
[27:55.000 --> 27:59.320]  the soros and you heard what the head of judicial watch said that soros has people filled at the
[27:59.320 --> 28:04.280]  state department and we've exposed who they are and trump needs to remove them now remove the
[28:04.280 --> 28:09.080]  soros operatives out of the government who are still operating under an emergency that obama
[28:09.080 --> 28:16.280]  signed into law three weeks before he left office the civil emergency is still there remove them
[28:16.280 --> 28:21.480]  cut the funding and that caravan and all the rest of the open borders crap will disappear
[28:21.480 --> 28:30.040]  it'll blow away like a sandcastle in a hurricane period if this whole soros operations the death
[28:30.040 --> 28:37.400]  star cutting the funding off is firing torpedoes down the exhaust port that's an allegory i'm not
[28:37.400 --> 28:43.880]  calling for firing torpedoes into the death star occupied by darth dumbass soros over here this
[28:43.880 --> 28:48.760]  evil nazi collaborator that we're so close to getting rid of but it's his people in the government
[28:48.760 --> 28:53.160]  that have got to be purged they want to purge free speech and purge the second amendment and

[32:02.840 --> 32:08.600]  it really is the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island
[32:08.600 --> 32:15.160]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain
[32:15.160 --> 32:21.720]  heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the ph of the water to unhealthy levels to find out
[32:21.720 --> 32:28.440]  we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and ph what we learned was that there
[32:28.440 --> 32:34.600]  was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water
[32:34.600 --> 32:40.440]  from our alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[32:40.440 --> 32:47.640]  but the ph was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure raises
[32:47.640 --> 32:53.800]  the ph of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate a rain
[32:53.800 --> 32:59.160]  water supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it
[33:03.320 --> 33:05.960]  you're listening to the alex jones show
[33:05.960 --> 33:21.560]  live from austin texas broadcasting worldwide it's alex jones
[33:24.680 --> 33:32.440]  so i'm gonna be very very clear about this the un has a public strategy working with multinational
[33:32.440 --> 33:39.320]  corporations to use giant third world middle eastern north african and latin american populations
[33:39.320 --> 33:44.360]  who are picked and cold because they're unskilled uh because they're socialist and communist they
[33:44.360 --> 33:50.840]  specifically in those countries get the criminals get the mentally ill uh get the people uh who are
[33:50.840 --> 33:57.080]  deadbeats they brainwash them at these un centers and then they start leapfrogging them up into the
[33:57.080 --> 34:03.800]  west once they get here they're picked up by the soros charities the un charities the leftist
[34:03.800 --> 34:11.240]  catholic charities not all catholics the leftist ones and but notice the pope being the leader of
[34:11.240 --> 34:17.720]  the leftist group and they do this and that's the fact and trump has said this is an invasion our
[34:17.720 --> 34:25.560]  military is waiting for you so soros is openly quarter backing with the stay behind networks
[34:25.560 --> 34:32.200]  at the cia and the state department with these groups that obama put into law before he left
[34:34.280 --> 34:40.040]  and now that you've got judicial watches directors super respected on fox shane there's
[34:40.040 --> 34:45.240]  illegal networks in the state department they're run by soros we must cut the funding out of the
[34:45.240 --> 34:52.120]  state department that goes to the un it goes directly to him the former heads of his foundations
[34:52.120 --> 34:56.920]  are the top people at the state department when you go three four five six seven deep
[34:58.120 --> 35:02.040]  they're the ones sabotaging you must remove them you must cut the funding
[35:04.440 --> 35:12.280]  because soros is purging and the globalist are purging our first amendment our second amendment
[35:12.280 --> 35:16.520]  our right to communicate our banking we're being put in a digital
[35:16.520 --> 35:26.280]  ghetto and the next phase is the digital glulag and they're saying they want to arrest prominent
[35:26.280 --> 35:31.640]  conservatives and libertarians and christians they're going for broke ladies and gentlemen
[35:31.640 --> 35:36.760]  they're not going to stop we're in the middle of a corporately funded leftist revolution with
[35:36.760 --> 35:42.440]  hollywood and all the dying corporate media and the chai comms and the eu unelected literal
[35:42.440 --> 35:49.800]  nazi heir to the entire nazi fortune the yukers ran nazi germany an unelected grandson whose dad
[35:49.800 --> 35:56.280]  was in the ss his dad the richest royalty in germany his grandfather literally best friends
[35:56.280 --> 36:03.480]  with george soros who just so happens to be a nazi collaborator too it we have real video of
[36:03.480 --> 36:10.920]  these two together yuker said he'd stop trump yuker said he'd stop america's recovery he said
[36:10.920 --> 36:18.520]  that a year and a half ago at debos he said we will crush america well guess what merkel and her
[36:18.520 --> 36:26.040]  coalition government just got voted out oh guess what the donald trump of brazil just got elected
[36:26.040 --> 36:31.000]  despite them trying to murder him being stabbed in public in the stomach in the liver and the in
[36:31.000 --> 36:43.160]  the kidneys barely survived tough as nails bolsanna it's on folks but we're in a thick fight here
[36:44.280 --> 36:53.800]  and it's heavy and it's serious and so when i say they want to purge us we're going to purge them
[36:53.800 --> 36:57.560]  they want to take our banking away they want to take our guns away they want to control our
[36:57.560 --> 37:02.120]  children they want to control our borders they want everything so that's a physical criminal
[37:02.120 --> 37:07.960]  authoritarian purge i just want them out of our government with our elected president has the power
[37:07.960 --> 37:13.960]  to do it in the executive branch i want trump's people in legal lawful that's my idea of a purge
[37:13.960 --> 37:17.880]  i want to see them indicted for the crimes they've committed and for the subterfuge and the rack
[37:17.880 --> 37:22.680]  of tearing to work to infiltrate independent media and try to shut it down i want them
[37:22.680 --> 37:29.160]  investigated for money laundering and i'm putting my life in my name and everything on the line
[37:29.160 --> 37:33.880]  because i know it's the only way out of this folks we're not going to bow down to these people and
[37:33.880 --> 37:39.240]  have them leave us alone so there's a lot of people want to cower to soros and want to cower to hillary
[37:39.240 --> 37:45.560]  and and and obama and their stay behind networks and they're so arrogant chopping the government
[37:45.560 --> 37:53.080]  full just chocked full of their operatives at state department and cia and they are just praying on
[37:53.080 --> 37:57.160]  the american people and they are just doing horrible horrible things they're doing the same
[37:57.160 --> 38:01.000]  program in europe and the same thing in africa and the same thing in latin america and people
[38:01.000 --> 38:08.760]  everywhere every time they can vote they're voting it out two big victories just today
[38:08.760 --> 38:15.560]  merkel out of power her party voted out in parliament took years to dig them out because they were
[38:15.560 --> 38:21.800]  gerrymandering it in the parliamentary manipulation using the muslim vote as a tiebreaker always to
[38:21.800 --> 38:28.680]  put him over the top victory in brazil it all signifies victory in eight days
[38:31.240 --> 38:37.080]  but they are gonna pull big stuff and you've been seeing it you you don't think there's not string
[38:37.080 --> 38:41.720]  pulling a manipulation going on with the last two terror events we just saw last week do you
[38:42.760 --> 38:48.360]  you just think that just magically happened on its own look at the timing look at the history
[38:48.360 --> 38:57.560]  look at the globalist and then pull back and ask yourself what are the globalists gonna pull
[38:58.520 --> 39:04.440]  what are they gonna activate what sleeper cells do they have ready right now with those truck
[39:04.440 --> 39:10.280]  bombs loaded and those machine guns ready you can bet your bottom dollar they're coming
[39:11.560 --> 39:16.120]  so everybody better have their security up and you better have your battle rifle by your
[39:16.120 --> 39:19.800]  bed to protect yourself lord knows i do
[39:23.480 --> 39:28.600]  so there's so much going on here and now is the most critical time ever they're trying to
[39:28.600 --> 39:33.880]  literally purge us out of culture and the authoritarian move all we're saying is recognize
[39:33.880 --> 39:37.880]  them as the enemy recognize they're committing these crimes recognize that they're going for
[39:37.880 --> 39:42.760]  broke because they're being dislodged worldwide right when the globalists thought they were
[39:42.760 --> 39:50.040]  going to make their move and totally take over and i'm just glad at this historical point in
[39:50.040 --> 39:58.680]  history that a spirit that a force that a character that a man like donald trump was there so that
[39:58.680 --> 40:05.560]  america we could do it bigger and better and help lead this thing and just as our 1776 came out of
[40:05.560 --> 40:13.240]  england's own 1776 activity and then we became the 1776 model for the world we're doing it again
[40:14.040 --> 40:22.040]  and i told you we were launching 1776 worldwide 12 years ago i told you this was all gonna happen
[40:22.040 --> 40:26.760]  if you made the decision to take action and to politically and economically and culturally
[40:26.760 --> 40:37.000]  engage and if you prayed to god and repented that we would be given this chance at at least an
[40:37.000 --> 40:44.840]  alternate path for our children and now we stand at that crossroads and the enemy like a demon
[40:44.840 --> 40:55.160]  possessed body is fighting to stay in there as much as they can now this is 1776 worldwide
[40:55.160 --> 40:59.800]  and the enemy doesn't like it because they've got 1984 brave new world worldwide

[47:16.120 --> 47:31.160]  we're just eight days out and i'm gonna say this one more time because if people don't
[47:31.160 --> 47:38.840]  understand this the enemy's gonna win there are corporate institutions that use american power
[47:38.840 --> 47:43.560]  to parlay that into a global corporate government where they're above the law or their tax exempt
[47:43.560 --> 47:49.240]  or they have diplomatic immunity and then they use giant third world populations as battering
[47:49.240 --> 47:55.080]  rams to drive down wages outside and inside the country but to also come in and then be weaponized
[47:55.080 --> 48:01.960]  politically and controlled by the eu the imf the world bank the un and that's all coordinated by the
[48:01.960 --> 48:08.680]  ngo's that are financed and funded by the very nation states themselves that are paying to be
[48:08.680 --> 48:16.680]  destroyed and this is the stated plan the globalist write books on it they have magazine articles
[48:16.680 --> 48:21.560]  they write foreign affairs at the cfr every two months it comes out it's like a book but it's a
[48:21.560 --> 48:26.920]  magazine and it's all there that's how i know their plan that's how i always know what they're
[48:26.920 --> 48:33.480]  going to pull next because they act like we're idiots and their plan is to make you poor and to
[48:33.480 --> 48:41.400]  make you pay to be enslaved and so lewdabs the judicial watch come on and say the un gets us
[48:41.400 --> 48:45.800]  money from the state department and then gives it to these foundations we have the documents it's a
[48:45.800 --> 48:52.600]  13 minute report it's on news wars dot com we just played part of it and it must be stopped it's
[48:52.600 --> 48:57.400]  illegal and it's under criminal investigation in guatemala and honduras and it needs to be under
[48:57.400 --> 49:04.600]  it here and then you have a firestorm of all the other corporate media oh they were anti-semitic
[49:05.960 --> 49:12.840]  they talk bad about poor soros that got sent a fake pipe bomb because you know he's a holocaust
[49:12.840 --> 49:20.600]  survivor yeah like hitler is he helped the nazis and yet everything's a lie everything's a fraud
[49:20.600 --> 49:26.680]  with these people because of course trump should be cutting the funding off from the state department
[49:26.680 --> 49:32.040]  that goes to soros you know you heard that soros spent two billion dollars in ukraine yeah he got it
[49:32.040 --> 49:38.040]  from the state department and then he went on seeing in on ferried zarkaria and bragged about it
[49:40.840 --> 49:44.120]  they funded people burning down government buildings and shooting police
[49:44.840 --> 49:50.600]  yeah george soros should be in prison and now he's leading the coalition to end our free speech
[49:50.600 --> 49:55.560]  here in america and he's got the neocons and the leftist and the deep state all on board
[49:55.560 --> 50:01.400]  and next hour david night joins us huge articles on info wars dot com and news wars dot com
[50:02.440 --> 50:06.840]  from the amazing folks at zero hedge dot com in fact i want to this is up yesterday i want to repost
[50:06.840 --> 50:13.400]  this there's also a another article facebook censorship will turn to the media just the beginning
[50:14.360 --> 50:20.920]  warns neocon top insider he says it's great and they're having meetings at the un and nato
[50:20.920 --> 50:28.840]  nato funded by the u.s. government nato on how to shut down trump that's right and trump has
[50:28.840 --> 50:32.760]  to declare an emergency that doesn't mean tanks driving up down the streets it means under the
[50:32.760 --> 50:39.160]  law declare an emergency to end obama's emergencies that's why the bureaucrats brag we cannot be fired
[50:39.160 --> 50:45.000]  under our hiring because you were hired under the war powers act and the president has lawyers
[50:45.000 --> 50:50.040]  that aren't advising him correctly he must declare his own civil emergency and then reverse it and
[50:50.040 --> 50:55.240]  fire every damn last one of them like ronald reagan did when he declared an emergency over the
[50:55.240 --> 51:02.200]  air traffic controllers that wasn't tanks i was they had all the fake libertarians which
[51:02.200 --> 51:05.560]  i've learned libertarians have always been there just to make sure republicans don't get elected
[51:07.000 --> 51:11.400]  just a steel vote away i mean that's what it is the ideology is great but not what they actually
[51:11.400 --> 51:20.680]  do their globalist controlled a hundred percent at the top and you sit back and you look at it
[51:23.320 --> 51:31.240]  it's incredible see a civil emergency is the powers the president has from one to a hundred
[51:32.520 --> 51:36.760]  a hundred is lining people up and shooting them in tanks and burning cities we didn't say that
[51:36.760 --> 51:42.440]  they had lost jones calls for martial law firing squads and tanks no i didn't i said just like
[51:42.440 --> 51:47.240]  reagan declared an emergency and fired the air traffic controllers trump needs to undeclare
[51:47.240 --> 51:52.520]  the emergency by declaring an emergency and remove their butts now
[51:55.640 --> 52:01.720]  we provided the president a list of top soros operatives in the white house at the state department
[52:01.720 --> 52:07.480]  eight or nine were removed earlier this year why do you think they're on such a war path because
[52:07.480 --> 52:12.840]  we're getting their butts fired and we're getting the information to the president and then he looks
[52:12.840 --> 52:17.800]  it up and then he orders it done and his own staff try to sneak around and double deal and
[52:17.800 --> 52:24.680]  cover their butts cya is going to destroy this country in the world the way you cover your booty
[52:25.240 --> 52:29.960]  is not being cowards and doing the right thing and then you have incredible prosperity instead
[52:29.960 --> 52:34.600]  most men i know don't want any confrontation with corruption don't want to stand up for
[52:34.600 --> 52:39.880]  their family they just want to play golf and act tough all day and then they're so unhappy
[52:39.880 --> 52:48.200]  though because they're not men they're miserable little boys i relish going up against evil like
[52:48.200 --> 52:53.960]  soros i relish the risk because the risk of them winning completely is so much more dangerous
[52:53.960 --> 53:01.400]  i'm not a risk seeker i'm doing this because the risk of them winning is too incredibly dangerous
[53:01.400 --> 53:08.680]  and so my every cell and my spirit says i love this do more jones fight harder
[53:10.520 --> 53:18.120]  no my cells tell me you're worthless get up off your ass and fight these people are coming to
[53:18.120 --> 53:24.440]  conquer your children and your country and everything and they're evil and i will not have alexander
[53:24.440 --> 53:29.640]  soros conquer me in the name of jesus christ i hope that he sent back to the nether regions
[53:30.280 --> 53:35.000]  i hope you all pray against these evil people in the name of jesus christ that's what they fear
[53:38.040 --> 53:41.320]  brian stelter and all these people oh i can't even look at him get him off screen
[53:41.320 --> 53:50.440]  these are monsters authoritarians that support wars and death and lies in the arab spring and
[53:50.440 --> 53:54.920]  they look at us and say we're violent or we're calling for violence i don't want any violence
[53:54.920 --> 54:03.400]  against any of these people offensively they attack defend yourself we're going to beat them in the
[54:03.400 --> 54:12.040]  information war the gift given to them by this very suspicious individual and the gift given by

[1:00:15.320 --> 1:00:27.720]  you know i am sweating and i am talking fast and i wasn't doing that before i got on air
[1:00:27.720 --> 1:00:35.000]  it's cold in here when i as a man as a father as a human think about all the knowledge i have
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:41.400]  just from researching that i want everybody else to have and how real it is it makes me
[1:00:41.400 --> 1:00:46.680]  i mean basically have a controlled panic attack on air that's what this is i'm not like this in
[1:00:46.680 --> 1:00:51.800]  person you have just hanging around with folks sitting around a pool i'm pretty low-key i might
[1:00:51.800 --> 1:00:59.880]  not talk for an hour but i get on air man and i'm and i know how the whole thing works i know
[1:00:59.880 --> 1:01:05.400]  who runs it i know their programs and then i just see them coming out in the open
[1:01:05.400 --> 1:01:10.520]  with a world government marshal plan
[1:01:13.080 --> 1:01:16.600]  and i said when they overthrow ukraine they're going to call for a marshal plan and then soros
[1:01:16.600 --> 1:01:21.720]  called for a marshal plan a month after and people are like whoa are you psychic how did you just
[1:01:21.720 --> 1:01:27.320]  no i know i'm not i mean everybody's got a little bit of a touch but you know what i mean on this it's
[1:01:27.320 --> 1:01:34.040]  hiding in plain view and they have set up a breakaway government under the marshal plan that took
[1:01:34.040 --> 1:01:40.760]  over europe and reorganized it and then they used that bureaucracy to start colonizing
[1:01:40.760 --> 1:01:45.000]  politically other countries and build a world government and build enclaves that ended up
[1:01:45.000 --> 1:01:51.160]  setting up the imf the world bank the world trade organization then the tpp that trump's
[1:01:51.160 --> 1:01:57.640]  pulling out of that ends your sovereignty and then they have people that run the marshal plan
[1:01:57.640 --> 1:02:07.720]  and to this day out of the state department and cia running public cia networks and justice
[1:02:07.720 --> 1:02:13.800]  department networks to overthrow the president and block our recovery it's insane and that's
[1:02:13.800 --> 1:02:20.680]  coming up next segment and i already know all this but then when i read more of it it just
[1:02:20.680 --> 1:02:29.960]  it's crazy they had nato forums and we've got c span video of this with americans and foreigners
[1:02:29.960 --> 1:02:35.400]  talking about how they shut down info wars and how they're gonna shut down everybody and how the
[1:02:35.400 --> 1:02:39.960]  800 sites they've shut down in one day a few weeks ago was just the beginning and how they're gonna
[1:02:39.960 --> 1:02:47.000]  have ip control and they're gonna basically kill the internet and how this is so wonderful and then he
[1:02:47.000 --> 1:02:55.240]  is of course part of the german marshal fund jamie fly
[1:02:58.200 --> 1:03:05.000]  and it's the xm bank and it's it's all and then it's yonker a yonker he owns lutsenberg
[1:03:05.640 --> 1:03:11.720]  because his grandfather sent in ss to kill people and had a coup these people own countries
[1:03:11.720 --> 1:03:18.200]  and he they're just slapping us upside down they got their little erin boy and
[1:03:18.200 --> 1:03:22.920]  nazi collaborator running around and everyone just grovels in fear and they shut down the
[1:03:22.920 --> 1:03:30.840]  free press and they piss all over our borders and just everything and then they brag on c span
[1:03:30.840 --> 1:03:36.440]  we're gonna take all the speech to protect democracy it's like saying we're gonna gut your
[1:03:36.440 --> 1:03:42.600]  children and hang them up other feet to make sure they go to sleep tonight and sleep good we're gonna

[1:07:05.880 --> 1:07:12.440]  and uh oh after years of playing parliamentary games even though she was only like 30 in polls
[1:07:12.440 --> 1:07:18.200]  last six years merkel has now been stepped down as they had of her party after they lost all the
[1:07:18.200 --> 1:07:21.960]  elections and she's still hanging on for another year and a half is cancelled but it's probably
[1:07:21.960 --> 1:07:27.320]  going to resign the next six months because she's hurting her party just like hillary's hurting her
[1:07:27.320 --> 1:07:34.920]  party but they don't know when to give up so that's so exciting and trump has come out
[1:07:35.640 --> 1:07:39.880]  and doubled down and knocked back down and said no it's the corporate media line and stirring up
[1:07:39.880 --> 1:07:47.800]  hate and stirring up all this violence remember that photo of trump over there at debos this year
[1:07:47.800 --> 1:07:52.200]  and they're all around all the socialist globalist leaders are all around staring at him he's
[1:07:52.200 --> 1:07:55.560]  sitting at the table and they're all standing because there's an actual real president there's
[1:07:55.560 --> 1:08:02.520]  someone that isn't a puppet of people like the chinese dictator g or the the the eu dictator
[1:08:02.520 --> 1:08:11.240]  jonker who pledged that he'll smash america and he'll defeat trump looked that up from when
[1:08:11.240 --> 1:08:15.960]  trump first got elected he said we'll crush america in a trade war because he's got all
[1:08:15.960 --> 1:08:21.560]  the state department people that went over there and took over the german empire the austrian
[1:08:21.560 --> 1:08:26.440]  hong korean empire at the end of world war two that was the marshal plan was the merger of those
[1:08:26.440 --> 1:08:36.360]  two empires and now you've got the german marshal fund foundation that's bigger than the carney
[1:08:36.360 --> 1:08:42.280]  endowment but you never hear about it but that's who shut up the imf the world bank the xm bank
[1:08:42.280 --> 1:08:47.720]  all that at the end of world war two the un all of a corporate global empire that's tax exempt
[1:08:47.720 --> 1:08:57.480]  and now these jerks docket became shop please now these jerks will roll some youtube video
[1:09:01.320 --> 1:09:05.560]  of the very players that are doing this now i'm going to settle down and ring david night in
[1:09:06.120 --> 1:09:13.400]  for this segment the next and i'm going to try to have to wait till my questions till
[1:09:13.400 --> 1:09:18.920]  the start of the fourth segment but this is so critical to understand that they're publicly
[1:09:18.920 --> 1:09:23.800]  bragging that they've started censorship here they've already completed integration in europe
[1:09:25.960 --> 1:09:32.600]  and they're going to censor everybody down to even the domain name and beyond and we'll talk
[1:09:32.600 --> 1:09:36.920]  about how to get around this tyranny as well with david night and new systems to block it but
[1:09:36.920 --> 1:09:41.480]  yeah in the future we'll have to give you the ones in zero code to go to info wars.com you'll
[1:09:41.480 --> 1:09:46.520]  have to hand put it in and save it they're trying to set up systems that even suppress that and
[1:09:46.520 --> 1:09:53.320]  they're bragging that to protect america from the russians and the chinese but the globalists
[1:09:53.320 --> 1:09:58.040]  are totally in bed with in the case of the chinese that they shut down all the patriot pro-trump media
[1:09:58.040 --> 1:10:03.400]  yeah right no they're the outside enemy they're the threat they're the robber barons that parlayed
[1:10:03.400 --> 1:10:10.200]  america winning world war two into taking over europe the russians got eastern europe we got western
[1:10:10.200 --> 1:10:15.800]  europe but instead of america getting europe and and rebuilding it and just leaving the bureaucracy
[1:10:15.800 --> 1:10:21.800]  stayed and then set up the e you which it's using to absorb america that's how this corporate program
[1:10:21.800 --> 1:10:26.280]  works uses the third world it uses the e you it uses all these international bodies to transfer
[1:10:26.280 --> 1:10:30.520]  our power into it and now they've got a worldwide program remember what came out about a year and
[1:10:30.520 --> 1:10:35.640]  a half ago that obama was going to hand full control of the internet over to the un he only
[1:10:35.640 --> 1:10:40.600]  handed part of it over because the pentagon got so upset darpa at least there's still i guess a few
[1:10:40.600 --> 1:10:45.800]  patriots left in there and sources on the news saying it was in the wiki leaks that he wanted
[1:10:45.800 --> 1:10:51.480]  control down to the domain name and said quote we'll block all the nationalist news and we'll
[1:10:51.480 --> 1:10:56.680]  push ours which he now has with snopes running facebook and twitter and deciding what's real
[1:10:57.720 --> 1:11:04.760]  total liars total frauds total total bs so this is it this is who rules you
[1:11:04.760 --> 1:11:09.000]  and this is who wants to get trump out who's trying to to at least have our country be run by
[1:11:09.000 --> 1:11:14.760]  we the people this is outrageous this is 21st century warfare so david let's get into this
[1:11:14.760 --> 1:11:19.480]  gentleman we've got the video linked on info wars dot com it's a 30 minute interview uh
[1:11:21.000 --> 1:11:27.240]  jamie fly of the marshal plan which again is an emergency marshal law reorganization system
[1:11:27.240 --> 1:11:34.040]  and what's the left one a permanent emergency they control the markets plunging so they can buy
[1:11:34.040 --> 1:11:39.400]  everything up and dictate our surrender these people are maneuvering us towards total cultural
[1:11:39.400 --> 1:11:43.640]  and economic collapse and they're stealing our first amendment and our infrastructure in front
[1:11:43.640 --> 1:11:49.320]  of us and coming after our guns and now google and facebook are banning people discussing firearms
[1:11:49.320 --> 1:11:55.560]  or how they like them or even police training with guns the it's here you see oh first it's
[1:11:55.560 --> 1:12:01.240]  alex jones then it's everybody so david knights with us for the next three segments uh david
[1:12:01.240 --> 1:12:07.560]  momentus uh what's happening so just boil down how insane this is just the beginning top neocon
[1:12:07.560 --> 1:12:13.400]  insider claims responsibility for facebook purge says there's more to come certainly so tell us
[1:12:13.400 --> 1:12:18.280]  about this is the uh these are the never trumpers and that's why this is not just a democrat attack
[1:12:18.280 --> 1:12:24.200]  on president trump uh this is the deep state the never trumpers the uh nato people uh the people
[1:12:24.200 --> 1:12:30.280]  at the project for new american century because that's where jamie fly uh got prominence in 2009
[1:12:30.280 --> 1:12:34.840]  he was director of foreign policy initiative there at the project for a new american century
[1:12:34.840 --> 1:12:41.480]  and of course uh in 2011 he was uh calling for military strikes on iran he's been at the forefront
[1:12:41.480 --> 1:12:47.800]  as a neocon and pushing for regime change in syria and elsewhere but alex it was just three weeks
[1:12:47.800 --> 1:12:53.240]  after hillary clinton lost that we had a hit list a blacklist that was published by the
[1:12:53.240 --> 1:12:58.280]  washington post it was provided to them by some shadowy group of foreign policy experts they said
[1:12:58.280 --> 1:13:05.000]  at a organization called prop or not in other words propaganda or not and they sent a list to
[1:13:05.000 --> 1:13:10.440]  washington post three weeks after the election where hillary clinton lost and they were widely
[1:13:10.440 --> 1:13:14.520]  criticized for putting out a kind of macartheistic blacklist it turns out that everybody that was
[1:13:14.520 --> 1:13:20.520]  on that list has now been uh de-platformed off of social media and that came three weeks after
[1:13:20.520 --> 1:13:26.280]  the election now if we go to about a year ago as november 2017 we had congressional hearings
[1:13:26.280 --> 1:13:30.440]  as people were pushing this russian propaganda narrative that's where they've all put this
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:38.360]  in 2017 we had congressional testimony and then after uh the the people from the social media
[1:13:38.360 --> 1:13:45.080]  companies left there was a former uh military officer former police officer uh that came on
[1:13:45.080 --> 1:13:48.600]  and talked about how they were losing the information war how they had to silence the
[1:13:48.600 --> 1:13:53.880]  cannons in social media that was a key thing for them to do they were talking about that in 2017
[1:13:53.880 --> 1:13:58.440]  and and and these were quotes and i should just add obama and the defense authorization act then
[1:13:58.440 --> 1:14:03.480]  set up stay behind networks to carry this out then they began having congressional hearings
[1:14:03.480 --> 1:14:08.200]  saying who needed to be banned so this is a criminal coordinated corporate governmental
[1:14:08.200 --> 1:14:13.800]  international intelligence trifecta against america our president all of it it is outrageously
[1:14:13.800 --> 1:14:17.880]  criminal and and these are the same people we need to understand these are the same people
[1:14:17.880 --> 1:14:23.480]  that have been pushing this russia gate stuff this uh nonsense uh it's all the same people
[1:14:23.480 --> 1:14:27.720]  the never trumpers the republicans and the democrats and people inside the military
[1:14:27.720 --> 1:14:32.920]  establishment the military industrial complex in march of this year there was a conference
[1:14:33.560 --> 1:14:39.480]  that was run by us special forces and this was reported by the atlantic council again this
[1:14:39.480 --> 1:14:43.880]  organization that uh had close ties with people like henry kissinger and so forth the atlantic
[1:14:43.880 --> 1:14:47.320]  council by the way gave a lot of money to facebook as they were starting up and now facebook is
[1:14:47.320 --> 1:14:51.800]  returning the favor giving a lot of money back to the atlantic council but they had this
[1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:57.160]  conference in march of this year they had it was called sovereignty in the information age
[1:14:57.720 --> 1:15:01.720]  and they had special forces they had domestic police forces here in the united states and
[1:15:01.720 --> 1:15:05.960]  they had companies like microsoft now if you remember microsoft was the very first company
[1:15:05.960 --> 1:15:11.320]  that got into the prism program uh for the nsa when we saw those files that were leaked by
[1:15:11.320 --> 1:15:15.800]  ed snowden uh they were one of the first snitch corporations the very last one to join and so
[1:15:15.800 --> 1:15:19.960]  what they're doing is they're organizing the entire infrastructure to go after american patriots
[1:15:19.960 --> 1:15:25.400]  literally at the behest of multinationals backed up by the communist chinese and yonker that's right
[1:15:25.400 --> 1:15:29.720]  and so at this conference alex the the title again is sovereignty in the information age
[1:15:30.280 --> 1:15:34.440]  one of the themes that they talked about was the fact that when the printing press came along
[1:15:34.440 --> 1:15:39.640]  it overthrew the feudal system and they saw that as a bad thing and they saw the internet and
[1:15:39.640 --> 1:15:43.560]  internet freedom and social media as something that could overthrow their future that's right and
[1:15:43.560 --> 1:15:47.160]  the key when we come back though you let it out beautifully today is they're announcing they're
[1:15:47.160 --> 1:15:52.520]  going to ban everybody and this is people in our own government working against america and they
[1:15:52.520 --> 1:15:59.320]  don't have the legal authority to do this this is all illegal marijuana has unleashed a green

[1:20:59.400 --> 1:21:05.240]  and then use it to invade europe and brag they're doing it and then they come out the full video
[1:21:05.240 --> 1:21:09.080]  is 30 minutes long it's on info wars dot com we've got all the quotes one of the top stories
[1:21:09.080 --> 1:21:13.960]  just the beginning top neocon insider claims responsibility for facebook perch well i know
[1:21:13.960 --> 1:21:20.680]  the groups are no they're involved they made up the list for obama when he left office they put
[1:21:20.680 --> 1:21:25.880]  the people in the neocons command the left at the intellectual level when it comes to actual
[1:21:25.880 --> 1:21:30.360]  dirty tricks and they're in there at the state department at the justice department and the
[1:21:30.360 --> 1:21:37.480]  cia not the whole cia but but this group with taxpayer money funding them then they have congressional
[1:21:37.480 --> 1:21:41.160]  hearings put out the talking points about alex shone's always bad and now they're moving on to
[1:21:41.160 --> 1:21:47.320]  lew dobs and matt drudge and rush limbaugh and shan hannity and tucker carlson and now they want
[1:21:47.320 --> 1:21:52.520]  everybody completely off the air and it's incredible they've gone this far and so now lew
[1:21:52.520 --> 1:21:56.760]  dobs talks about it and talks about how the un needs its funding cut because that's whose funding
[1:21:56.760 --> 1:22:01.240]  sorrows and they go oh my god it's anti-semitic remove it it's not anti-semitic they don't even
[1:22:01.240 --> 1:22:05.960]  say what dobs said you go look at the report on info wars dot com it's the full 13 minute we have a
[1:22:05.960 --> 1:22:11.240]  three minute we played here he's talking about a judicial watch with the documents we covered this
[1:22:11.240 --> 1:22:17.320]  years ago but here it is gateway pundit today leak documents prove sorrows open society is working
[1:22:17.320 --> 1:22:21.880]  with you and in supporting current legal migrant crisis i can't believe we even have to debate this
[1:22:21.880 --> 1:22:29.640]  of course it is this is sorrows publicly bragging about it they think you're so stupid
[1:22:30.920 --> 1:22:35.720]  and again sorrows plots collapsing europe under the weight of millions of migrants and then having
[1:22:35.720 --> 1:22:42.040]  an emergency reorganization officially merging it with africa and latin america here's an article
[1:22:42.040 --> 1:22:49.880]  from july 1st 2016 info wars dot com sorrows plots european order coup e u will disintegrate rise again
[1:22:49.880 --> 1:22:58.600]  under new marshal plan all right back to david night david continued getting into this latest
[1:22:58.600 --> 1:23:03.320]  individual and what their quarterbacking and and then how they plan their censorship and some of
[1:23:03.320 --> 1:23:09.560]  the ideas that you've had experts on the counter this but this is serious they mean business and
[1:23:09.560 --> 1:23:15.720]  just like authoritarians always do they start with the nazis and then they move on to alex jones
[1:23:15.720 --> 1:23:19.960]  and then they now they want trump off the air they want him off twitter they've taken your twitter
[1:23:19.960 --> 1:23:24.920]  they're taking everything from everybody tens of thousands of groups now and they're moving forward
[1:23:24.920 --> 1:23:29.960]  towards big events let's continue yeah alex it was at a burland security conference where they're
[1:23:29.960 --> 1:23:37.560]  talking about their new iron curtain for social media and this is reported by jeb sprague this is
[1:23:37.560 --> 1:23:43.160]  uh he's with a group that's been trying to uh monitor and expose uh people taking away our
[1:23:43.160 --> 1:23:47.480]  freedom of speech but let me give you some of the things that jamie fly said this is the guy that i
[1:23:47.480 --> 1:23:51.320]  said uh before he's been with the project for a new american century and so forth he's been with
[1:23:51.320 --> 1:23:56.440]  the bushes and and so forth and i think it's important to point out also alex that he was the
[1:23:56.440 --> 1:24:01.080]  foreign policy advisor for marco rubio none other than marco rubio the guy that had never heard of
[1:24:01.080 --> 1:24:06.440]  your site info wars and when he was holding hearings about uh what was happening on social
[1:24:06.440 --> 1:24:11.320]  media and free speech he wanted to make sure that they were going to have the ability to censor
[1:24:11.320 --> 1:24:15.400]  and that they were going to have preeminence to censor over china but he didn't want you to testify
[1:24:15.400 --> 1:24:19.240]  he didn't want anybody else that had been shadow banned at that point now they've done it to more
[1:24:19.240 --> 1:24:24.920]  than 800 sites and this guy was bragging about the fact that they had just shut it down he said
[1:24:24.920 --> 1:24:28.440]  so they can just invent stories and get repeated and spread throughout different sites so we're
[1:24:28.440 --> 1:24:33.560]  just starting to push back just this last week facebook began starting to take down sites so
[1:24:33.560 --> 1:24:39.080]  this is just the beginning and as he's talking about it he's he's bemoaning the fact that foreign
[1:24:39.080 --> 1:24:43.640]  powers can take advantage of our open political system so what's the solution to that that's to
[1:24:43.640 --> 1:24:49.080]  close the political system uh for this guy uh he said all you need is an email to set up a facebook
[1:24:49.080 --> 1:24:53.320]  or twitter account so let's shut that down as well let's make that difficult let's register
[1:24:53.320 --> 1:24:56.920]  everybody with some kind of biometric and where to get on the internet this is where these people
[1:24:56.920 --> 1:25:02.040]  are going so the key alex is that we can try to fight them and there's there's plenty that has
[1:25:02.040 --> 1:25:06.120]  already been done to fight this so we've already had a supreme court decision going back to 1946
[1:25:06.120 --> 1:25:11.400]  if people wanted to pay any attention to it it's a situation where the supreme court said you cannot
[1:25:11.400 --> 1:25:16.680]  even if you own the the public square if it's privately owned it was a a town that was owned
[1:25:16.680 --> 1:25:21.480]  by one corporation and they had a lady who wanted to pass out some jojoba's witness literature she
[1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:24.360]  fought him all the way to the supreme court because they threw her out of the public square they said
[1:25:24.360 --> 1:25:29.800]  even if the public square is privately owned you can't censor it and we've had jack dorsi say over
[1:25:29.800 --> 1:25:33.800]  and over again where the public square the twitter but i mean here's the thing well of course it's
[1:25:33.800 --> 1:25:39.960]  unconstitutional but at every level it's illegal to have cartels of government unelected bureauc
[1:25:39.960 --> 1:25:45.720]  bureaucrats with international foundations and the un also by the rockefellers and this whole
[1:25:45.720 --> 1:25:50.680]  crew uh involved trying to destroy our borders trying to shut down our speech trying to take
[1:25:50.680 --> 1:25:55.720]  our guns and now it was announced today facebook and twitter are saying we're not gonna let you
[1:25:55.720 --> 1:26:01.960]  talk about guns just so now they're removing the word firearm uh just like in china they're
[1:26:01.960 --> 1:26:08.360]  removing taiwanese emojis and wenny the poo whatever they want these people are flaming
[1:26:08.360 --> 1:26:13.400]  tyrants they are incredible clear and present dangers and they're setting it up to say we're
[1:26:13.400 --> 1:26:17.960]  violent when they're the authors of all these wars and arab springs and and and and all this
[1:26:17.960 --> 1:26:23.800]  other horrible stuff but it is getting to the point where they are like hitler and you know as
[1:26:23.800 --> 1:26:27.880]  they keep saying that we're getting violent so they get violent with us they're clearly walking
[1:26:27.880 --> 1:26:33.960]  us down a road where all these neocons and all these leftist leaders are the equivalent of tojo
[1:26:33.960 --> 1:26:40.520]  and hitler and musilini and and stala i mean i mean they really are into that territory big time
[1:26:40.520 --> 1:26:45.240]  and they are supporting authoritarian china and google and apple are all helping them round up
[1:26:45.240 --> 1:26:50.200]  dissidents and kill them show and they have the worst slave factories apple does showing they do
[1:26:50.200 --> 1:26:55.880]  that here if they could and you know what they're moving the needle that way david oh yeah yeah they
[1:26:55.880 --> 1:26:59.080]  they don't care about the first amendment they don't care about the second amendment they don't care
[1:26:59.080 --> 1:27:03.000]  about the supreme court decisions they're gonna go ahead with this so there's another aspect of
[1:27:03.000 --> 1:27:10.200]  this alex i talked to justin tab earlier today on the program uh the morning program and he's got a
[1:27:10.200 --> 1:27:17.160]  uh a new foundation of decentralized computing for the internet he calls it substratum uh you
[1:27:17.160 --> 1:27:22.280]  can find them at substratum.net they're currently in beta testing but what they're doing is they're
[1:27:22.280 --> 1:27:27.400]  setting up something that is the next generation to vpn and with just four nodes because vpn only
[1:27:27.400 --> 1:27:32.120]  gives you one node it doesn't give you anonymity they anonymize this in a number of ways but with
[1:27:32.120 --> 1:27:36.920]  just four nodes they're able to penetrate the firewall of china as well as russia and iran
[1:27:36.920 --> 1:27:42.040]  and i said well that's fine but what about you know you can get facebook now in iran but facebook is
[1:27:42.040 --> 1:27:46.120]  doing the censorship here and so he says well the next stage is that they're going to do their own
[1:27:46.120 --> 1:27:50.360]  hosting because that's what we've seen with gab and the third stage is they're going to provide
[1:27:50.360 --> 1:27:55.080]  monetization for this and one of the important things about this alex is that they're upfront
[1:27:55.080 --> 1:28:01.320]  about the funding they got funded with crowd sourcing funds and then once this thing is operating
[1:28:01.320 --> 1:28:06.360]  it's going to operate kind of like you have with cryptocurrency mining so as you use it you'd pay
[1:28:06.360 --> 1:28:10.840]  a little bit for it and then as you're providing your service as a node you're going to earn money
[1:28:10.840 --> 1:28:15.560]  back which is what's transparent about that which is what darput is on the internet to begin with
[1:28:15.560 --> 1:28:18.920]  there's about a bunch of nodes we're going to come back and talk more about this and i want to talk
[1:28:18.920 --> 1:28:24.440]  about the real father of the internet now he says big tech's a tyranny uh and and and how they're
[1:28:24.440 --> 1:28:29.240]  organizing a new system as well that's similar to this uh to counter it and also have you take
[1:28:29.240 --> 1:28:34.920]  control of your browser and and and build your internet interface the way you want uh very very
[1:28:34.920 --> 1:28:39.960]  exciting moves against big tech that's why there's a race by the authoritarian's big tech dying
[1:28:39.960 --> 1:28:45.480]  dinosaur media old corrupt warmongering elites against innovation against renaissance and against
[1:28:45.480 --> 1:28:52.280]  the 1776 relaunch which is already effectively penetrated enemy defenses in the information
[1:28:52.280 --> 1:28:58.200]  war and is now reaping massive victories from brazil and germany in just the last day hear that

[1:32:57.000 --> 1:33:04.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show
[1:33:27.960 --> 1:33:30.360]  America
[1:33:52.120 --> 1:33:55.240]  We are back live broadcasting worldwide and this country is under
[1:33:55.240 --> 1:34:01.240]  massive attack and people need to get out of their comfort zone and realize that they're
[1:34:01.240 --> 1:34:07.000]  shutting down independent pro free market pro america pro christian decency in this country
[1:34:07.720 --> 1:34:12.040]  and then they're targeting us and sexualizing our children and they're pushing all these deadly
[1:34:12.040 --> 1:34:17.320]  psychotropic drugs on us and they're demoralizing us with hollywood it's all part of the plan
[1:34:17.320 --> 1:34:25.160]  and now they've got all of these different people coming after what's left of the nation
[1:34:25.160 --> 1:34:28.680]  and the president is standing up saying the corporate media is the enemy of america
[1:34:28.680 --> 1:34:32.600]  they're dividing us they're pushing the hate they're the bad guys the un with sorrows is
[1:34:32.600 --> 1:34:37.560]  organizing invasion forces waving foreign flags burning american flags screaming we're
[1:34:37.560 --> 1:34:43.480]  coming to socialize you we're leaving venezuela and marching up norte there's no one else will
[1:34:43.480 --> 1:34:51.080]  take them that's really venezuelans and that's how insane this has gotten that's how crazy this is
[1:34:52.200 --> 1:34:58.120]  and america's future is hanging in the balance europe's is the whole world and you have this
[1:34:58.120 --> 1:35:03.160]  authoritarian coalition just like another times in history world war one world war two but this
[1:35:03.160 --> 1:35:07.880]  time the authoritarian coalition is bureaucracies and multinational trillion dollar corporations
[1:35:07.880 --> 1:35:15.720]  and the murderous chai cons and the unelected eu and then the hollywood america hating constellation
[1:35:17.560 --> 1:35:23.880]  that is moving against humanity and trying to destabilize us it's insane to watch so david
[1:35:24.600 --> 1:35:29.720]  i want to get more into some of the decentralizations and ideas and that's all important and great
[1:35:30.600 --> 1:35:35.160]  but big tech's trying to destroy anybody that tries to set up their own gab dot com
[1:35:35.160 --> 1:35:39.880]  they're trying to shut down uh any other type of social network they're going to try to shut down
[1:35:39.880 --> 1:35:44.360]  these new decentralization so it's great we need to innovate out of their tyranny
[1:35:44.360 --> 1:35:49.240]  but we also need to face the tyranny head on like cut the funding to the un for the refugee
[1:35:49.240 --> 1:35:53.800]  program because it's given to george soros boom that's why they censor dobs that's cutting the
[1:35:53.800 --> 1:35:59.080]  head of the snake off sort of fighting all these giant waves though after who's doing it just like
[1:35:59.080 --> 1:36:02.360]  they're trying to shut us down because we're the ones trying to reboot the country they know who
[1:36:02.360 --> 1:36:07.240]  to attack they come after you know that the intellectual command base they know what the whole
[1:36:07.240 --> 1:36:12.680]  trump revolution founts out of info wars and i don't say that to brag we're under attack folks
[1:36:12.680 --> 1:36:18.280]  because we're loyal americans that do our homework and are ready to fight politically okay oh yeah
[1:36:18.280 --> 1:36:23.800]  absolutely i i interviewed a couple of people from the free thought project after the purge of
[1:36:23.800 --> 1:36:29.320]  800 sites and they had pointed out they said we told you beginning of august when they took down
[1:36:29.320 --> 1:36:33.160]  info wars they said well they've taken alex knows now we're next and then they're coming for you
[1:36:33.160 --> 1:36:38.040]  it's the old thing from pester martin emuler from the uh nazi general first they came for that group
[1:36:38.040 --> 1:36:40.600]  and i didn't do anything then they came for the other group then they came for me and there was
[1:36:40.600 --> 1:36:46.600]  nobody left to help me and people have to understand where this is headed you know this last purge
[1:36:46.600 --> 1:36:51.480]  it was mostly uh trump supporters and conservatives because they've been the most active on social
[1:36:51.480 --> 1:36:55.080]  media but it also went for libertarians it also went for people on the left because they're going
[1:36:55.080 --> 1:37:01.160]  for anybody that isn't part of the controlled establishment and alex this has been a tool
[1:37:01.160 --> 1:37:05.480]  of psychological control designed as that i think from the very beginning the guy who
[1:37:05.480 --> 1:37:09.400]  put out the idea for the internet he called it the intergalactic computer network jcr lick
[1:37:09.400 --> 1:37:14.760]  lighter at darpa he was a psychologist i think all of this stuff is a psychological tool of control
[1:37:14.760 --> 1:37:19.000]  but the key is i think and there's some very encouraging things on the horizon there's a
[1:37:19.000 --> 1:37:25.960]  lot of people that are working on things i talked to uh justin tab from substratum.net today and uh
[1:37:25.960 --> 1:37:30.280]  he's kind of following along the same lines as george gilder is talking about george gilder
[1:37:30.280 --> 1:37:34.680]  you may remember him he wrote a book back in 1994 life after television he predicted the
[1:37:35.240 --> 1:37:41.160]  uh the development of the smart phone and steve jobs thought he was so prescient that in 2007
[1:37:41.720 --> 1:37:46.760]  uh yeah this is 13 years later 2007 while they're working on the iphone while they're designing the
[1:37:46.760 --> 1:37:50.360]  iphone he had everybody in the staff read it said this is where this is ultimately going this is
[1:37:50.360 --> 1:37:55.480]  how it's going to be used well george gilder has now got a new book he calls it uh life after google
[1:37:55.480 --> 1:37:59.960]  and he talks about the cryptocosm and he said this is going to be something that is designed
[1:37:59.960 --> 1:38:04.840]  from the ground up to be secure that's going to be the number one design goal to keep it secure and
[1:38:04.840 --> 1:38:09.880]  in order to do that you've got to make sure that it's not centralized he talks about how the fatal
[1:38:09.880 --> 1:38:14.760]  conceit of all these people at google and elsewhere is that they want to control everything they want
[1:38:14.760 --> 1:38:18.600]  to have a centralized control of everything you know bright Bart is called them the masters of the
[1:38:18.600 --> 1:38:21.960]  universe mocking them that well that's the way they see themselves they see themselves as masters
[1:38:21.960 --> 1:38:26.360]  of the universe they want to control all this stuff they want to bring it into a central location
[1:38:26.360 --> 1:38:31.320]  i think that's one of the reasons why they were aided by venture capital firms that were directly
[1:38:31.320 --> 1:38:37.480]  funded by uh DARPA and the cia some of them indirectly funded they had people from DARPA
[1:38:37.480 --> 1:38:43.000]  setting on the venture capital uh boards of these uh companies that were funding uh facebook and google
[1:38:43.000 --> 1:38:47.240]  because they knew that they would be reliable partners and this kind of control technology
[1:38:47.240 --> 1:38:50.840]  but the issue is going to be that it's going to have to be designed from the ground up to be
[1:38:50.840 --> 1:38:55.640]  decentralized and that's one of the design goals of substratum they understand that and also you
[1:38:55.640 --> 1:39:01.400]  have to have you can't add it on as a bag afterwards you can't do it as a patch you can't do it as an
[1:39:01.400 --> 1:39:05.880]  add-on down the road it has to be designed that way from the beginning so they're talking about
[1:39:05.880 --> 1:39:10.600]  designing this foundation this new foundation uh substratum and then they're talking about
[1:39:10.600 --> 1:39:16.040]  they understand that you still have to be able to protect against different platforms being taken
[1:39:16.040 --> 1:39:20.920]  down which is what we're seeing happening to gab right now there have been threats in the past
[1:39:20.920 --> 1:39:25.640]  microsoft said they're going to take them down you've had now go daddy you've had another organization
[1:39:25.640 --> 1:39:31.800]  they have multiple hosting sites that have taken them down so these people they said they're they
[1:39:31.800 --> 1:39:36.840]  are committed to having a free internet and free speech and so they're going to set up this
[1:39:36.840 --> 1:39:43.000]  uh platform that's going to give a decentralized method here that gives us anonymity gives us
[1:39:43.000 --> 1:39:47.800]  privacy and then they're going to host uh sites in a way that they won't be able to take them down
[1:39:47.800 --> 1:39:52.200]  and then also provide a way to have monetization because they've been involved in cryptocurrency
[1:39:52.760 --> 1:39:56.200]  for the last couple of years well that's what it's about and and we have to innovate we have to
[1:39:56.200 --> 1:40:00.600]  build new systems and people have to support those systems but the globalists are moving quick
[1:40:00.600 --> 1:40:04.360]  they're already shutting everything down and they're going to shut all that down too and they're
[1:40:04.360 --> 1:40:08.360]  working in concert with the banks with the corporate media and with the governments and with the
[1:40:08.360 --> 1:40:12.520]  stay behind networks and they're in open rebellion against trump and other nationalists but the good
[1:40:12.520 --> 1:40:19.720]  news is bolsonara uh in brazil what we're seeing with merkel being voted out as a leader of her party
[1:40:20.760 --> 1:40:26.600]  in in in germany that is very very very exciting we got to go to break david and when we come back
[1:40:27.320 --> 1:40:31.240]  i want to talk about the lewdobbs piece and how it's so on target and why
[1:40:31.240 --> 1:40:34.520]  they're calling for him to be fired and all the rest of it for just pointing out that soros
[1:40:34.520 --> 1:40:39.400]  is getting taxpayer money to fund this caravan it's because it's so true and it's so outrageous
[1:40:39.400 --> 1:40:43.720]  and and and what soros is doing is criminal and judicial watch is talking to law enforcement that
[1:40:43.720 --> 1:40:48.760]  says this is criminal they need to be indicted they're organizing human smuggling if you are
[1:40:48.760 --> 1:40:52.600]  i did this we'd go 20 years in prison we're going to come back to you after the break uh listeners
[1:40:54.520 --> 1:41:00.760]  we're in a fight here i mean we're eight days out i can feel you know uh the the the the cultural

[1:47:44.200 --> 1:47:50.520]  off of air i have spent too much time studying the clintons and george soros and yunker and the
[1:47:50.520 --> 1:48:02.200]  chinese commies and i just know everything about them and they're just so damn evil and i biologically
[1:48:02.200 --> 1:48:08.200]  have to get myself in a position where i'm not gonna have a heart attack because i just feel
[1:48:08.200 --> 1:48:14.440]  incompetent fighting and then i see all these other men around me and people they don't even care
[1:48:14.440 --> 1:48:22.200]  that we're being taken over by horrible people and our birthright is being stolen
[1:48:23.720 --> 1:48:30.360]  and as i hear david talk and cover all this i get madder and i get madder and i get madder

[1:48:46.840 --> 1:48:51.160]  angst is because this is the real antichrist spirit they're bringing in a world government

[1:49:18.040 --> 1:49:23.240]  vacation but i can't you know why you take a vacation not because i'm tired because i can't
[1:49:23.240 --> 1:49:29.800]  sleep at night now because of this because i have too much energy now because i'm aware of what

[1:50:59.160 --> 1:51:04.760]  know this is this is not a cave bear coming in to eat your kids this is worse than that because it
[1:51:04.760 --> 1:51:12.360]  just eats their body it doesn't get their souls this is the worst stuff man this is a real horror
[1:51:12.360 --> 1:51:18.600]  movie okay with people that are satanic and want a world government and want to literally destroy
[1:51:18.600 --> 1:51:22.840]  your soul david i've been ranting we're gonna air a little segment you did this great interview
[1:51:22.840 --> 1:51:26.360]  today with this gentleman and the great job that Travis cut this together the producer for your
[1:51:26.360 --> 1:51:32.840]  show uh and we'll talk about uh substratum dot net and and just in a top just a just another great
[1:51:32.840 --> 1:51:36.440]  you know you think what's happening to get around the censorship but i think really politically
[1:51:36.440 --> 1:51:42.280]  heading it off up front is the way to go uh but but just the time we have left here how are you and
[1:51:42.280 --> 1:51:48.200]  your family you know handling this how are you dealing with seeing real as a historian and an
[1:51:48.200 --> 1:51:53.400]  engineer and a smart guy what is it like for you how are you processing this because when you watch
[1:51:53.400 --> 1:52:01.240]  real organized tyranny come after you lie about you censor you uh do it there i mean how are you
[1:52:01.240 --> 1:52:07.960]  dealing with this raping of our birthright i mean i mean i mean is it getting to you i i have a
[1:52:07.960 --> 1:52:12.440]  pretty thick skin i've been doing this now for a few years here so i've seen a lot of criticism
[1:52:12.440 --> 1:52:16.040]  come out so i don't care if they criticize me personally you know it really makes me angry
[1:52:16.040 --> 1:52:20.040]  when they come after the first amendment when they say i don't like you so we're going to take down
[1:52:20.040 --> 1:52:25.560]  info wars i had we had former friends uh that my wife was still in contact with on facebook
[1:52:26.120 --> 1:52:29.800]  and before the stuff started in august they were saying well i'm going to get off of facebook if
[1:52:29.800 --> 1:52:34.280]  they don't take down info wars i said you idiot do you realize what you're throwing away do you
[1:52:34.280 --> 1:52:37.880]  realize the birthright of freedom that you're throwing away here and that's what's really
[1:52:37.880 --> 1:52:44.520]  concerning me is because i see the constitution going down the drain and it's not just freedom of
[1:52:44.520 --> 1:52:49.400]  speech but it's our due process it's everything that they are destroying here in this country and
[1:52:49.400 --> 1:52:53.240]  they're doing it by degrees yeah i agree that we need to fight them legally we need to fight them
[1:52:53.240 --> 1:52:57.800]  politically we need to fight them every way that we can i i just want to give people hope and
[1:52:57.800 --> 1:53:02.200]  have them understand that there are some technological things that are being done on the side but
[1:53:02.200 --> 1:53:07.960]  you know we look at this alex it's not just cnn anymore i mean cnn has come out as the enemy
[1:53:07.960 --> 1:53:14.360]  of the first amendment they have come out as these deceptive people like you said following
[1:53:14.360 --> 1:53:19.560]  you around you know lurking around the office and so forth trying to film things trying to uh
[1:53:19.560 --> 1:53:24.920]  uh you know dox us essentially uh they're despicable they're not journalists at all
[1:53:24.920 --> 1:53:30.520]  they are government operatives they're propagandists and when we look at all of this pushback i'm
[1:53:30.520 --> 1:53:36.680]  really sad to see this happening with the new fox management the way they banned the judicial watch
[1:53:36.680 --> 1:53:40.920]  board member i mean judicial watch has been solid on this stuff like i said earlier today
[1:53:40.920 --> 1:53:47.160]  we have uh wiki leaks has been publishing what whistleblowers put out judicial watch has given
[1:53:47.160 --> 1:53:51.800]  us a great deal of information because you have to sue the government to get them to turn over
[1:53:51.800 --> 1:53:56.520]  what they're supposed to do under the law under the freedom of information act and it's a fact
[1:53:56.520 --> 1:54:01.560]  sorrows is the is the is the hot show and the general and the field marshal oh we know that
[1:54:02.200 --> 1:54:05.560]  and then they they have the documents and he says it and he says it's illegal
[1:54:05.560 --> 1:54:12.440]  clearly to organize human smuggling and use taxpayer money and because it's so true well my god you
[1:54:12.440 --> 1:54:19.000]  can't say black is black and white is white so yeah your band as as as ever coming back on fox
[1:54:19.000 --> 1:54:24.360]  when judicial watch is totally respected and has always been on fox and it got the documents
[1:54:25.160 --> 1:54:30.200]  yeah well think back to uh 2016 i talked about this earlier on the program forbs magazine which
[1:54:30.200 --> 1:54:36.120]  agrees with sorrows open borders in september 2016 remember this is just before the election
[1:54:36.120 --> 1:54:41.560]  we had a uh a nominee donald trump he wasn't president then he was a nominee at the time
[1:54:41.560 --> 1:54:45.800]  and they run this article saying uh george soros billionaire george soros earmarks
[1:54:45.800 --> 1:54:49.560]  a half a billion dollars for migrants and refugees he said i'm going to contribute 11
[1:54:49.560 --> 1:54:54.120]  billion dollars well now he said i'm going to contribute 18 billion dollars and at the time
[1:54:54.120 --> 1:54:59.320]  he was opposing president trump by giving five he'd already given five million dollars to just
[1:54:59.320 --> 1:55:05.080]  one pack and listen alex to the name of this pack immigrant voters win that was the name of the pack
[1:55:05.080 --> 1:55:11.000]  that george soros gave five million dollars to to oppose president trump back in march of 2016
[1:55:11.000 --> 1:55:15.960]  this guy has been funding it one way after the other exactly they're saying the the the chairman
[1:55:15.960 --> 1:55:22.040]  of judicial watch has been banned from all fox news shows because he said the sun is yellow in color
[1:55:22.760 --> 1:55:27.160]  yeah yeah yeah because he criticized george soros and they said well george soros is jewish
[1:55:27.160 --> 1:55:31.800]  so therefore he gets to pass even though george soros has been funding all of these palestinian
[1:55:31.800 --> 1:55:36.680]  groups and people that hate israel they say well he gets a blanket coverage because it came out in
[1:55:36.680 --> 1:55:42.280]  the jerusalem post in wikileaks that he believes that israel should be overthrown yeah i mean that's
[1:55:42.280 --> 1:55:49.000]  what i mean it is the most insane crap i've ever heard yeah yeah it's absolutely amazing but it's
[1:55:49.000 --> 1:55:53.000]  very well documented they're not even ashamed of it i mean the people who support open borders the
[1:55:53.000 --> 1:55:57.080]  people on wall street and so forth are bragging about the fact that they're going to use emigrant
[1:55:57.080 --> 1:56:03.800]  voters and this is not even a question and yet to see that the the new management at fox news i
[1:56:03.800 --> 1:56:10.760]  reported last week the fact that fox news was talking to or hey ramos he was uh he was down
[1:56:10.760 --> 1:56:15.320]  there with the caravan and they said well the reporter said we're kind of concerned that some
[1:56:15.320 --> 1:56:19.960]  of these people might be criminals and have been thrown out of the u.s multiple times and so
[1:56:19.960 --> 1:56:23.400]  they're all men that are walking past him he turns around and he says to them in spanish you
[1:56:23.400 --> 1:56:27.160]  know are you have you been thrown out before and they said no no no he goes see see they haven't
[1:56:27.160 --> 1:56:31.960]  been thrown out see they're not criminals so we got their word for it was it was really kind of
[1:56:31.960 --> 1:56:36.440]  ludicrous you're absolutely right and some of the people recovering their faces look here's the deal
[1:56:36.440 --> 1:56:40.120]  the globalists think we're chumps they think we're weak they're making their move on our country
[1:56:40.120 --> 1:56:43.880]  they're trying to shut down our whole culture shut down our whole world and we have to decide
[1:56:43.880 --> 1:56:47.640]  whether we would be slaves or not because we're not just getting conquered by a new group you know
[1:56:47.640 --> 1:56:52.120]  like the roman empire comes in and you get aqueducts and you know medicine and still they were rough
[1:56:52.120 --> 1:56:57.800]  but in some areas they were liberators this is not a good thing you know it's kind of like in
[1:56:57.800 --> 1:57:01.960]  life of brian that they're going what are the romans ever goes well the aqueducts well literature
[1:57:01.960 --> 1:57:07.160]  well medicine well but but but no we're not getting anything but enslavement in post industrial

[1:59:53.800 --> 2:00:05.000]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want to stop tyranny will so
[2:00:05.000 --> 2:00:14.040]  does he lie from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones tell us a little bit about
[2:00:14.920 --> 2:00:18.760]  about substratum and what you've been able to accomplish in just the last uh
[2:00:18.760 --> 2:00:22.840]  and just this last week i think you just did the uh recent test where you got into iran is that
[2:00:22.840 --> 2:00:28.280]  right that's right so substratum was founded a little over a year ago we were crowdfunded to
[2:00:28.280 --> 2:00:34.840]  fight global censorship and basically with the with the premise of being able to decentralize
[2:00:34.840 --> 2:00:40.200]  the internet make it free and open for everyone uh all everyone have the same access to the same
[2:00:40.200 --> 2:00:46.680]  information everyone have the freedom to say what they want uh online and so uh we worked about for
[2:00:46.680 --> 2:00:52.440]  the past year uh along those goals with our initial goals being china russia and iran uh
[2:00:52.440 --> 2:00:57.720]  because those were the three uh most heavily censored uh locations at the time so just in
[2:00:57.720 --> 2:01:01.400]  the past week we've been able to demonstrate that the software really does work just with a
[2:01:01.400 --> 2:01:07.080]  minimal number four nodes that's all it takes to make the uh to make the product work and we've
[2:01:07.080 --> 2:01:12.760]  been able to circumnavigate uh the great firewall in china and show demonstrate you know facebook
[2:01:12.760 --> 2:01:18.520]  in china youtube in china twitter in china and then we went on to demonstrate that as well in
[2:01:18.520 --> 2:01:24.040]  russia the big band in russia is obviously telegram uh and so demonstrate telegram working
[2:01:24.040 --> 2:01:29.240]  inside of russia and then inside of iran uh just about everything is banned so we went through and
[2:01:29.240 --> 2:01:37.960]  did the same demonstration uh in iran uh showing uh facebook google open google uh youtube and twitter
[2:01:37.960 --> 2:01:42.520]  and some others uh working in iran it was august the sixth that they took info wars off and then
[2:01:42.520 --> 2:01:48.360]  it was about two months later they took off 800 sites uh the majority of those were uh trump
[2:01:48.360 --> 2:01:52.040]  supporting conservative sites but not all of them there was a lot of libertarian sites that did not
[2:01:52.040 --> 2:01:57.000]  support president trump there were a lot of left-wing sites some of them that were uh dancing and
[2:01:57.000 --> 2:02:02.120]  celebrating when free speech was taken away from info wars because they're looking at anybody that's
[2:02:02.120 --> 2:02:08.120]  not part of the core establishment and uh so this is coming very rapidly the movements that we saw
[2:02:08.120 --> 2:02:14.040]  against gab this weekend are very alarming as well and there's a data point here i've talked about
[2:02:14.040 --> 2:02:19.400]  this a couple of weeks ago we got a guy named jamie fly and he was uh uh talking at a berlin
[2:02:19.400 --> 2:02:24.760]  security conference bragging about the fact that they'd taken down these 800 sites and saying there
[2:02:24.760 --> 2:02:29.640]  was more to come uh implying that they were actually going to take down the websites themselves you
[2:02:29.640 --> 2:02:33.560]  know not just take them off of social media but they were going to purge them further on and calling
[2:02:33.560 --> 2:02:37.480]  all of them russian agents whether they're conservative libertarian or left-wing they're
[2:02:37.480 --> 2:02:41.160]  all russian agents and we're going to take everybody down this is really coming from a guy who
[2:02:41.720 --> 2:02:45.720]  worked for the bush administration he's a neocon he's been a project for a new american century
[2:02:45.720 --> 2:02:50.600]  and so forth these are people who are at the core of the establishment they're nonpartisan
[2:02:50.600 --> 2:02:54.920]  but they are deep state individuals who want to take down everybody with us and then we need to
[2:02:54.920 --> 2:03:00.360]  have a product like what you're creating right now well it really is hitting a point too where you
[2:03:00.360 --> 2:03:04.600]  just look at the progression over the last year when we initially started this again like i said
[2:03:04.600 --> 2:03:08.920]  we had three targets because those were the uh the most highly censored at the time but just
[2:03:08.920 --> 2:03:14.200]  since then you had the the net neutrality repeal in the united states you have the the copyright
[2:03:14.200 --> 2:03:20.520]  directive article 13 in the european union and that that really goes and should should should
[2:03:20.520 --> 2:03:25.480]  push developers to say hey uh substratums providing us this platform this foundation to
[2:03:25.480 --> 2:03:29.880]  build on top of we need to go and start building these new tools that can't be censored using the
[2:03:29.880 --> 2:03:35.000]  power of the blockchain and decentralization because what what the european union one is doing
[2:03:35.000 --> 2:03:39.800]  is censoring within the platform and saying basically if you you know that's why they call
[2:03:39.800 --> 2:03:44.680]  it the meme killer because if you upload something and they basically have to store it and then within
[2:03:44.680 --> 2:03:50.520]  24 hours remove it vietnam had almost the exact same rolling so it really has progressed very
[2:03:50.520 --> 2:03:55.400]  rapidly and when you guys got taken off i told everybody that hey whether you agree with them
[2:03:55.400 --> 2:04:00.200]  or not uh this is a big thing and you should be shouting from the rooftops that this is not fair
[2:04:00.200 --> 2:04:04.520]  because the next one could be you i appreciate that and i i saw on reddit where you're talking
[2:04:04.520 --> 2:04:09.400]  about the fact you're coming on here and you got criticized by uh one individual there and said that
[2:04:09.400 --> 2:04:14.760]  info words is a societal cancer and and some people took him to task for that he goes i don't
[2:04:14.760 --> 2:04:18.520]  care you violate somebody's terms of services well i would like for this guy maybe he does know
[2:04:18.520 --> 2:04:23.960]  maybe he works for google or maybe he works for a project for a new american century maybe he can
[2:04:23.960 --> 2:04:29.320]  tell me exactly what it was because i never received even a warning let alone three violations i was
[2:04:29.320 --> 2:04:35.720]  just immediately that's david night uh interviewing the head of substratum.net justin tobb now coming
[2:04:35.720 --> 2:04:41.480]  up there he is the man of the hour he's been alex jones of five of the next level andrew torba

[2:06:08.280 --> 2:06:26.360]  would it be nice to have free speech again the alex jones wouldn't be nice because there is a war
[2:06:26.360 --> 2:06:42.360]  on it go from this to this all right folks we are joined by andrew torbub
[2:06:44.360 --> 2:06:49.000]  who has been blamed as well as website that was gab dot com is now down
[2:06:49.000 --> 2:06:57.560]  on ton 10 removed off of the hosting provider their banking taken away their paypal taken away
[2:06:57.560 --> 2:07:03.560]  their stripe taken away and the left is celebrating it the mainstream media celebrating it and now
[2:07:03.560 --> 2:07:08.040]  they want lou dobbs and now they want sean hannity why they're saying lou dobbs is any semi
[2:07:08.040 --> 2:07:12.120]  he had the head of judicial watch on saying we suit and got the documents from the federal government
[2:07:12.120 --> 2:07:19.720]  but george soros is funding with us taxpayer money he gets these illegal caravans that are
[2:07:19.720 --> 2:07:25.640]  human smuggling but they said my gosh george soros even though he's a nazi collaborator
[2:07:26.760 --> 2:07:33.160]  is jewish so you can't talk like that lou dobbs and the judicial watch individual
[2:07:34.600 --> 2:07:40.600]  you are banned for life from fox news so they're just getting us used to all that because what he
[2:07:40.600 --> 2:07:47.560]  said was true so to give us the latest is andrew torbub and i guess we don't have gab dot com
[2:07:47.560 --> 2:07:51.800]  for now hopefully it'll be back up soon and i noticed you gave us that big exclusive interview
[2:07:52.840 --> 2:07:56.120]  but no corporate media wants to pick it up that the law enforcement praised you
[2:07:56.920 --> 2:07:59.720]  that the fact that they understood that he didn't make clear threats on the site that
[2:07:59.720 --> 2:08:04.680]  it was four minutes before uh no no no none of that world exclusive gab founder responds to
[2:08:04.680 --> 2:08:11.400]  synagogue massacre and lashes out at the lying msm none of that powerful interview he got seen by
[2:08:11.400 --> 2:08:16.760]  all people at info wars dot com but but other than that you'd think the person being demonized and
[2:08:16.760 --> 2:08:24.120]  he platformed you'd think that that person would end up getting a voice but like with
[2:08:24.120 --> 2:08:29.640]  their congressional hearings about me and why i don't get called to those no i sit outside because
[2:08:29.640 --> 2:08:33.560]  i don't get to face my accusers andrew thanks for joining us you can break it all down and
[2:08:33.560 --> 2:08:38.680]  give us the latest sure ox thanks for having me and that's exactly why i'm on this show and that's
[2:08:38.680 --> 2:08:43.800]  exactly why i'm not talking to any mainstream media outlets you give me a fair chance you allow me
[2:08:43.800 --> 2:08:49.960]  to speak my mind allow me to uh tell the situation from my perspective without any bias uh so i
[2:08:49.960 --> 2:08:55.560]  really appreciate that so here's the situation last night we shut down gab at around 10 o'clock
[2:08:55.560 --> 2:09:00.360]  eastern we did this preemptively because nine o'clock this morning our hosting provider had
[2:09:00.360 --> 2:09:05.160]  polled our service on the website you know we proclaimed that we've spent pretty much the
[2:09:05.160 --> 2:09:11.400]  past 48 hours working directly with the doj and with the fbi they have praised us for our work
[2:09:12.600 --> 2:09:18.680]  in helping them with this situation and to bring justice to this awful despicable event
[2:09:19.560 --> 2:09:25.960]  i'm on about three hours sleep that is our top priority the media can attack us all they want
[2:09:25.960 --> 2:09:29.640]  they're showing up at my parents home i just got a text message from my mom
[2:09:29.640 --> 2:09:33.880]  the media just showed up at my parents home they're calling old professors they're trying
[2:09:33.880 --> 2:09:38.840]  to get in touch with my brothers and old friends from high school they're now launching an all
[2:09:38.840 --> 2:09:45.480]  out assault and all out character assassination on me on my family we're receiving death threats
[2:09:45.480 --> 2:09:52.600]  why because i stood up and built my own platform for freedom of expression and for individual
[2:09:52.600 --> 2:10:00.760]  liberty for all people why because i am working with law enforcement directly cooperatively
[2:10:00.760 --> 2:10:06.600]  helping to bring justice and see to it that justice is served in this horrific tragedy
[2:10:06.600 --> 2:10:10.520]  that is why they are attacking me that is why they are attacking my family that is why they
[2:10:10.520 --> 2:10:17.000]  are attacking gab these people are disgusting and despicable and there's no way i'm going to
[2:10:17.000 --> 2:10:22.280]  cower there's no way i'm going to bend the knee and there's no way i'm going to stop fighting
[2:10:22.280 --> 2:10:28.680]  we are going to get gab.com back online whatever it takes we're going to come back and be bigger
[2:10:28.680 --> 2:10:33.640]  and better than ever before and thanks to the media it doesn't matter it doesn't matter what
[2:10:33.640 --> 2:10:37.880]  they write it doesn't matter what they're these talking heads say on tv it doesn't matter with
[2:10:37.880 --> 2:10:44.520]  these these verified blue checkmarks that no one's ever heard of say on twitter with their
[2:10:44.520 --> 2:10:50.520]  opinions that's not the real world you know 80 percent of normal working class blue-collar
[2:10:50.520 --> 2:10:56.360]  average people agree with gab they agree and want to defend free expression and individual liberty
[2:10:56.360 --> 2:11:02.920]  at all costs and they know that there are disgusting murderers and terrorists and pedophiles all over
[2:11:02.920 --> 2:11:08.680]  facebook all over instagram all over twitter and they are not blamed there is no call for shutdown
[2:11:08.680 --> 2:11:15.080]  of these platforms so you know what here's the thing without gab the fbi and the doj would not
[2:11:15.080 --> 2:11:21.160]  have this mountain of evidence for a motive against this alleged terrorist and you know we also wouldn't
[2:11:21.160 --> 2:11:25.800]  know that he does not support the president united states at all so i think that might be one reason
[2:11:25.800 --> 2:11:30.840]  why the media is so upset is because now they can't point and say hey this is all donald trump's
[2:11:30.840 --> 2:11:35.160]  fault look this is one of your supporters because this man did not support donald trump and he made
[2:11:35.160 --> 2:11:40.920]  that very clear on gab and if he wasn't on gab we would not have known that if he wasn't on gab
[2:11:40.920 --> 2:11:46.200]  the the fbi and the doj would not have a mountain of evidence now to prosecute him
[2:11:46.200 --> 2:11:51.400]  so we're really proud to be working with law enforcement and we will happily take the slings
[2:11:51.400 --> 2:11:57.320]  and arrows from the dishonest and disgusting media elites and we're going to stand tall
[2:11:57.320 --> 2:12:03.240]  and fight for free expression and individual liberty for all people i gotta tell you you're one
[2:12:03.240 --> 2:12:08.680]  of the most articulate people i know and compared to the heads of other tech companies you're a
[2:12:08.680 --> 2:12:14.280]  wizard i mean these guys are bumbling stumbling buffoons because they're usually frontmen and
[2:12:14.280 --> 2:12:20.760]  they're also reading off teleprompters but i've i'm on gab and even more so that i've been banned
[2:12:20.760 --> 2:12:27.720]  everywhere else and i see what's on there and a minority of it is the nazis but they've all
[2:12:27.720 --> 2:12:31.880]  been pushed off the rest of the internet it's not your fault that then you have a free speech
[2:12:31.880 --> 2:12:36.440]  venue and they're there people should go debate them they should go argue with them there that's
[2:12:36.440 --> 2:12:41.080]  what it's all about but meanwhile like you said in your tweets and i'm not going to have twitter
[2:12:41.080 --> 2:12:46.600]  because their calls have to be taken down so you can't respond these lies that twitter is a cesspool
[2:12:46.600 --> 2:12:52.520]  of radical islam a cesspool of nazi crap they leave all that up because it creates division
[2:12:52.520 --> 2:12:57.800]  but it's the libertarians and the people that call out the the censorship or call out authoritarian
[2:12:57.800 --> 2:13:03.800]  china it's those of us that are real classical liberals that are being shut down because we're
[2:13:03.800 --> 2:13:10.040]  big 10 we're popular we're popular with minorities we're popular with everybody and that's why gab's
[2:13:10.040 --> 2:13:15.240]  got to be shut down that's why info wars has got to be shut down because we're popular because
[2:13:15.240 --> 2:13:19.880]  we're successful and we scare the big tech companies and we scare the big uh you know
[2:13:19.880 --> 2:13:25.000]  mainstream media and and and now i've got articles here today google and amazon cracked down on guns
[2:13:25.000 --> 2:13:28.760]  but still make it easy to find bomb-making instructions and they're now cracking down
[2:13:28.760 --> 2:13:33.400]  people even talking about guns or being gun enthusiasts they are they're now saying don't
[2:13:33.400 --> 2:13:38.200]  use the word nationalist oh that's nazi oh you can't even say george soros is behind the caravan
[2:13:38.200 --> 2:13:44.120]  even though he is or lou dobbs will get fired this censorship is racing out of control and it's
[2:13:44.120 --> 2:13:48.840]  got big tech government and corporations behind it except for trump but he needs to act and act now
[2:13:48.840 --> 2:13:54.120]  what would you say that you'd like to see the president do or congress do well well alex i
[2:13:54.120 --> 2:13:59.480]  think he needs to take antitrust action against big tech you have a duopoly like apple and google
[2:13:59.480 --> 2:14:05.320]  that controls 98 percent market share mobile app distribution that doesn't allow gab to have any
[2:14:05.320 --> 2:14:10.360]  distribution of mobile application across you know billions of mobile devices so i think he
[2:14:10.360 --> 2:14:15.240]  needs to take action he needs to take action fast before 2020 and what i want to say is uh you know
[2:14:15.240 --> 2:14:21.560]  we just compiled a massive list of hundreds of tweets uh calling for the death of the president
[2:14:22.520 --> 2:14:26.840]  you know threatening to kill the president on twitter they're all archives we tweeted them out
[2:14:26.840 --> 2:14:31.320]  and these are allowed to remain twitter's allowed to remain why why is the press not calling for
[2:14:31.320 --> 2:14:37.320]  twitter to be shut down secondly there was an academic study a few months ago that studied
[2:14:37.320 --> 2:14:44.520]  every single post ever made on gab and what they found is that 94 percent of posts did not contain
[2:14:44.520 --> 2:14:50.760]  any hate speech whatsoever now this is compared to 97 percent of posts on twitter now of course
[2:14:50.760 --> 2:14:57.240]  they probably had a different sample size who knows but in our case they scanned every single
[2:14:57.240 --> 2:15:03.960]  post ever made so what what is happening is uh we are being um no platformed off the internet
[2:15:03.960 --> 2:15:08.680]  because we have 2 percent more hate speech than twitter so is that the baseline so if gab gets
[2:15:08.680 --> 2:15:14.280]  down to two percent off site twitter are we going to be allowed to be on the internet are we going
[2:15:14.280 --> 2:15:18.280]  to be allowed to be on app stores i don't know well sure but then they'll just redefine what
[2:15:18.280 --> 2:15:23.560]  hate speech is now they're saying it's nationalist or not liking starosis politics it's it's not agreeing
[2:15:23.560 --> 2:15:26.920]  with them i want to do one more segment oh you're very busy i want to come back and talk about how
[2:15:26.920 --> 2:15:31.240]  we support you where we can visit you now i guess it's only on twitter actually you'll see you have
[2:15:31.240 --> 2:15:35.720]  speech for now they're calling for you to be removed but founder of group that harassed Ted Cruz
[2:15:36.360 --> 2:15:41.240]  tweeted about dead cops assassinating mike pence they're allowed to have hundreds of thousands
[2:15:41.240 --> 2:15:47.800]  of followers per account and organize violence nationwide why because the guy looks like a satanic
[2:15:47.800 --> 2:15:52.440]  chicken neck daemon that's why he's allowed to do this meanwhile gab does nothing they're gone

[2:20:43.160 --> 2:20:48.920]  pittsburgh but the idea that twitter and facebook and all them could could could have this guy on
[2:20:48.920 --> 2:20:54.280]  there instagram had him on there they weren't taken down so uh just respond to that please
[2:20:54.280 --> 2:20:58.840]  other thoughts the harassment when you think gab will be back up andrew torba

[2:21:15.960 --> 2:21:20.680]  go handle this situation but what we're doing is uh we're working around the clock with law
[2:21:20.680 --> 2:21:24.840]  enforcement and i want everybody to know that that is our top priority we want to see that
[2:21:24.840 --> 2:21:30.680]  justice is served for this horrible despicable monster number one and number two we're working

[2:21:52.600 --> 2:21:57.880]  popping on my broadcast david knights of the others again andrew torba our prayers are with
[2:21:57.880 --> 2:22:03.160]  you because we're in this together uh as as the test getting pigs but now they're even going
[2:22:03.160 --> 2:22:07.240]  after cabela's they're going after the nra so america better wake up put their foot down thank you so
[2:22:07.240 --> 2:22:13.960]  much thanks alex thank you imagine ladies and gentlemen they had an account and said similar
[2:22:13.960 --> 2:22:23.000]  things on instagram and on facebook the gentleman that that that they're alleging and i'm sure it
[2:22:23.000 --> 2:22:26.280]  sounds like it's true there's a lot of witnesses uh did this but you're always supposed to say alleged
[2:22:26.280 --> 2:22:37.320]  think about that and yeah he's posting anti-semitic stuff about trump in fact i finally went through
[2:22:37.320 --> 2:22:44.920]  this morning and looked at the heavy dot com i think it was had like all of his posts on it
[2:22:44.920 --> 2:22:52.360]  not just a few about bashing trump and there were dozens of trump getting orders from you know
[2:22:52.360 --> 2:22:59.960]  nazi style uh jewish cartoons and just all this crap and the media has just totally dropped that
[2:22:59.960 --> 2:23:04.200]  and they're still trying to say trump created the climate for this when this guy hated trump
[2:23:05.400 --> 2:23:12.280]  and the left is way more anti jew or anti israel than the right wing is in modern times
[2:23:12.280 --> 2:23:16.680]  and that's a fact you go to leftist universities or you go to these protests or you go to these
[2:23:16.680 --> 2:23:22.760]  events or you go on facebook or twitter they let radical islam go around to all this really violent
[2:23:22.760 --> 2:23:27.080]  horrible nasty stuff that crosses the line into calling for violence and they let
[2:23:28.760 --> 2:23:35.960]  the left go around and just freak out over israel and say the wildest stuff and then
[2:23:35.960 --> 2:23:46.680]  then they just turn it all around and then use it against the first amendment and blame us
[2:23:47.800 --> 2:23:54.520]  and and and say jones is anti-semitic he's talking bad about george soros and it's just so empty
[2:23:55.720 --> 2:24:04.360]  it's so fraudulent it's so deceptive it's so disingenuous and i see the the the pr talking
[2:24:04.360 --> 2:24:13.240]  point from cnn msnbc the young turks and i see even sink uger whatever his name is looks sick when
[2:24:13.240 --> 2:24:18.120]  he says it he goes george soros is a holocaust survivor who was captured by the nazis and is a
[2:24:18.120 --> 2:24:25.640]  hero alex jones is a horrible liar should be taken offline for saying that george soros is a nazi
[2:24:27.560 --> 2:24:34.120]  alex jones is the worst person in the world that's a quote and it was the same thing from
[2:24:34.120 --> 2:24:43.880]  lester holt and meghan kelly and ryan stelter and every channel every show says alex jones is wrong
[2:24:45.320 --> 2:24:52.120]  alex jones is a liar george soros survived the nazis even my old friend joe rogan
[2:24:53.560 --> 2:24:58.840]  when shooter jennings was sitting there talking to him i was another host the point was they talked
[2:24:58.840 --> 2:25:07.000]  about twice and i played the clip and he goes we know alex lied you know he wow like alex before
[2:25:07.000 --> 2:25:12.920]  he lied he said soros you know helped the nazis well no his soros was captured by the nazis
[2:25:13.960 --> 2:25:19.560]  and you're sitting there looking at that do i need to come back from break and play him on
[2:25:19.560 --> 2:25:30.040]  npr and 60 minutes how he helped the nazis round people up i mean it's jones jesus's new film
[2:25:31.880 --> 2:25:36.680]  and liberal cinemas across the country wouldn't even book the film even though he's had the
[2:25:36.680 --> 2:25:42.840]  number one documentary several times they wouldn't book it because they're so party line to defend
[2:25:42.840 --> 2:25:50.600]  soros to defend yunker to defend the nazism uh the real nazism of the eu i mean the ukrainian
[2:25:50.600 --> 2:25:57.880]  group that overthrew the elected government literally heil hitler and are so crazy they
[2:25:57.880 --> 2:26:04.040]  go beyond the nazis their their their campaign literature and their meetings are giant telescreens
[2:26:04.040 --> 2:26:12.600]  that show blonde-haired and blonde-haired men and women's firing electricity out of their fingertips
[2:26:13.160 --> 2:26:21.240]  called the hall hitler across between heiling hitler and emperor palpatine i'm like wow that's
[2:26:21.240 --> 2:26:27.800]  a new level heiling hitler and blue electricity shoots out and fries people and george soros is
[2:26:27.800 --> 2:26:37.720]  funding it and then this dirty nasty scumbag has his dirty nasty collaborator media shang where
[2:26:37.720 --> 2:26:45.720]  the nazis i mean it's just it's actually pretty entertaining at a sick level this is crazy this
[2:26:45.720 --> 2:26:53.400]  is crazy and so you stare into the abyss too long you become the abyss and i've got to take a vacation
[2:26:53.400 --> 2:26:58.680]  i know you do too as soon as this election's over but i got a sneaking suspicion things are
[2:26:58.680 --> 2:27:07.560]  going to get even crazier after this i forget what you search to pull up because they only use the
[2:27:07.560 --> 2:27:12.040]  nazis to storm to power then they removed them from leadership they're still in the parliament but
[2:27:13.240 --> 2:27:19.720]  what do you search it's like nazis leading the ukrainian revolt new ukrainian leader as a nazi
[2:27:19.720 --> 2:27:25.320]  and click images and it's them actually heiling you know heiling hitler
[2:27:27.160 --> 2:27:37.560]  and you're like in 2015 1670 yeah that's going on oh but obviously soros is involved oh you know he
[2:27:37.560 --> 2:27:42.200]  was young when he helped the nazis round people up he wouldn't be doing it now and then he's helping
[2:27:42.200 --> 2:27:48.120]  them shoot police and burn down government buildings to overthrow the elected government
[2:27:48.120 --> 2:27:53.560]  and then he goes on ferried zarkarius show yeah they crucify people too they crucify
[2:27:54.760 --> 2:28:02.200]  orthodox ukrainians and so it's the same battle lines of world war two where the west is pro-nazi
[2:28:02.200 --> 2:28:07.560]  and catholic i'm not bashing catholics that's just the battle lines and then the east is is is
[2:28:08.760 --> 2:28:12.360]  more russian and orthodox and so that was the battle lines they had in world war two so it's
[2:28:12.360 --> 2:28:19.160]  right back back to again because you know if you're ukrainian you know half of you your grand daddy
[2:28:19.160 --> 2:28:23.080]  or great grand daddy worked for hitler and they don't think hitler was wrong so they're just right
[2:28:23.080 --> 2:28:30.520]  back in government heiling hitler oh and who helped him get into power oh i forgot the guy that when
[2:28:30.520 --> 2:28:36.120]  he was 14 15 16 was what was they called the nazis called a bloodhound and that would be a young
[2:28:36.120 --> 2:28:41.080]  jewish person usually a male who could trick people and who looked younger than they were who
[2:28:41.080 --> 2:28:46.680]  they could insert and find their hidey holes and that's what he did they was sent in to find and dig
[2:28:46.680 --> 2:28:51.880]  out people like and frank so they could have their brains blown out with the right back stay with us

[2:33:13.400 --> 2:33:22.680]  with the republic or against it resistance to tyrants is obedience to god it's alex jones
[2:33:23.320 --> 2:33:28.920]  my wife has had this as her ringtone since we met on the phone so when i call it's like
[2:33:30.040 --> 2:33:36.200]  in my 18 months old daughter last week i called my wife and she can see my picture pop up and she
[2:33:36.200 --> 2:33:43.880]  goes daddy so i guess we should call this song in the uh computer than their daddy that's pretty
[2:33:43.880 --> 2:33:50.920]  cool what my wife thinks of though thinks that means like good stuff there uh you know i'm bummed
[2:33:50.920 --> 2:33:56.200]  out to hear this but this is some of the stuff that goes on at fox news and the new management they
[2:33:56.200 --> 2:34:03.400]  have they try to control turning point usa and i know the folks at turning point usa flew back
[2:34:03.400 --> 2:34:08.040]  for the inauguration on the same plane as the head of it uh like kanda sones a lot she came here
[2:34:08.040 --> 2:34:12.040]  you know she's great uh when they were attacking her and doxxing her and the left was going after
[2:34:12.040 --> 2:34:16.680]  we we we helped you know launch her paul watson did she talks to paul all the time on you know on
[2:34:16.680 --> 2:34:24.280]  on on private message paul watson of info wars dot com but she won't talk to me because i'm targeted
[2:34:24.280 --> 2:34:31.320]  i'm demonized i'm i'm the bad guy i'm the outsider which is fine uh but then you get kanye saying i'm
[2:34:31.320 --> 2:34:37.080]  the matrix breaker and they even cut that out of the interview uh not not turning point usa but the
[2:34:37.800 --> 2:34:42.920]  the the the record company that he was there giving the event this is the level of suppression
[2:34:42.920 --> 2:34:48.200]  that's going on so i'm not doing this interview with hotep jesus uh to to to put down turning
[2:34:48.200 --> 2:34:54.520]  point usa or or any of this i love kanda sones i love the work she does but hotep was invited in
[2:34:54.520 --> 2:34:58.840]  the young black leadership uh you know conference at at the white house not going to get trumpet
[2:34:58.840 --> 2:35:04.520]  nothing to do with it but then he got axed out of there and then will johnson uh he doesn't work
[2:35:04.520 --> 2:35:10.280]  with info wars he was there trump said who gets attacked more than me he said info wars and trump
[2:35:10.280 --> 2:35:14.840]  points rival says yeah basically you're right nobody had that angle uh and it became a big news
[2:35:14.840 --> 2:35:19.960]  story well what did trump mean or were they saying fake news i know trump was agreeing yeah info wars
[2:35:19.960 --> 2:35:26.760]  gets attacked a lot i don't think as much as the president but a close second and so we're
[2:35:26.760 --> 2:35:34.920]  going to talk about all that and and and just is there a bligsit or black exit black black sit how
[2:35:34.920 --> 2:35:39.160]  do you how do you say that that's a kandace owens thing and kind of put out shirts listen
[2:35:39.160 --> 2:35:43.640]  i just want white people black people everybody to get off the globalist plantation and get back
[2:35:43.640 --> 2:35:47.880]  to the nationalist plantation or back to the individual you know having power and not being
[2:35:47.880 --> 2:35:52.200]  part of some cult or some group we'll talk to hotep in a minute but here is the footage that will
[2:35:52.200 --> 2:35:57.640]  johnson sent us uh of up close and personal with the president from a different angle
[2:35:57.640 --> 2:36:02.600]  when they were talking about who's been persecuted here it is they're attacking us because we are
[2:36:02.600 --> 2:36:09.400]  speaking the truth changing people's minds and proving every day that our policies work and
[2:36:10.040 --> 2:36:15.880]  we are really doing what's right and what's good and i get attacked also you get attacked i get
[2:36:15.880 --> 2:36:24.120]  attacked i'm just thinking come to think of it who gets attacked more than me
[2:36:38.280 --> 2:36:44.120]  man look how together trump is you got will johnson probably three rows four rows back
[2:36:44.120 --> 2:36:49.720]  trump looks at him winks and goes yeah maybe more so that's just how on trump is
[2:36:50.360 --> 2:36:56.120]  so they say he's senile and all this i've seen him a few times slur his words when he gets really
[2:36:56.120 --> 2:36:59.960]  tired but i mean i do that myself people ask me sometimes i'm like i'll be on at night
[2:36:59.960 --> 2:37:04.120]  people go may sound like you're a little drunk you kind of slurring your words if i was drinking
[2:37:04.120 --> 2:37:08.520]  i wouldn't be slurring my words the fact i alcohol gives me energy that that much but i'm up
[2:37:08.520 --> 2:37:12.520]  been up for 20 hours i'm not drinking that's when that's when i'll be slurring the word seriously
[2:37:12.520 --> 2:37:17.160]  but side issue hotep jesus has reached hundreds of millions of people online
[2:37:17.160 --> 2:37:23.080]  books by brian dot com hotep nation dot com uh at twitter for now at vibe high he's the famous
[2:37:23.080 --> 2:37:29.320]  guy for doing really funny uh was just illustrated points of going into a starbucks and saying
[2:37:29.320 --> 2:37:33.160]  i hear your races give me a free coffee to prove you're not racist and the lady gives them the
[2:37:33.160 --> 2:37:42.280]  coffee we sent our own um travis night and he's white uh about as wide as you get and uh
[2:37:42.280 --> 2:37:48.360]  they gave him the stuff too so this is crazy and so hotep joins us and i want to get into
[2:37:48.360 --> 2:37:52.200]  trump in the world and what he thinks is gonna happen in seven and a half days of the election
[2:37:52.200 --> 2:37:59.000]  but first up and i'm just saying this because now twitter and google are censoring people
[2:37:59.000 --> 2:38:02.200]  just talking about the second amendment and that's the news today and and now they're
[2:38:02.200 --> 2:38:06.120]  want trump censored and now they want the n r a taken off now they want ludov's taken off and it's
[2:38:06.120 --> 2:38:10.840]  like whatever the new person is that gets attacked by the control corporate left and the big twitter
[2:38:10.840 --> 2:38:17.320]  brigades everybody runs away from hoping they don't get eaten next and then that person gets destroyed
[2:38:17.320 --> 2:38:22.440]  or or curtailed and then they move on to the next and so i just think we should have a big open
[2:38:22.440 --> 2:38:27.320]  tent i don't think lucifer con should be taken off uh twitter uh i'll just not call for violence
[2:38:27.320 --> 2:38:32.280]  in fact i think trump should invite lucifer con to the white house you know i had dinner with lucifer
[2:38:32.280 --> 2:38:37.240]  con privately and i i spent like eight hours with him i got tired i was actually tired it's about
[2:38:37.240 --> 2:38:42.920]  four hours of dinner i said i got to go he was actually offended i said man dude how much energy
[2:38:42.920 --> 2:38:47.400]  do you have i can't do because i agree a lot of what lucifer con says about have your own community
[2:38:47.400 --> 2:38:51.160]  make your own money have your own industry be self-sufficient the system wants to destroy you
[2:38:51.160 --> 2:38:55.080]  that's true i don't agree with all the you know some of the anti-semitic stuff he said before
[2:38:55.080 --> 2:38:59.560]  i say some of it because he doesn't say a lot of it i just want a big owner buddy to come together
[2:38:59.560 --> 2:39:05.080]  but side is you i'm ranting we have our guest on to be our guests so oh and then guest hosting fourth
[2:39:05.080 --> 2:39:09.640]  hour oh and benjamin's going to be here huge pianist that's not the dirty word it's huge
[2:39:09.640 --> 2:39:15.960]  pianist he's a big guy he plays a piano so hotep good to have you on what do you want to tackle first
[2:39:17.240 --> 2:39:22.600]  alex what's up man thank you for having me man look you hit it up now you hit the nail on the
[2:39:22.600 --> 2:39:27.640]  head tp osa he doesn't like guys like us and that's just the fact of the matter you know they have
[2:39:27.640 --> 2:39:34.680]  this new trend about npc we don't fall into the npc mold and the npc thing is a disease that
[2:39:34.680 --> 2:39:40.120]  affects both the left and the right and we're not infected we're we're we're actually free you know
[2:39:40.120 --> 2:39:46.200]  black has this new thing where they say we free and the whole tab jesus is banned we're not free
[2:39:47.960 --> 2:39:51.720]  well did they give you a reason why you were invited you're very successful reach hundreds of
[2:39:51.720 --> 2:39:58.200]  millions of people and then you're not allowed anymore they said it's the optics from the media
[2:39:58.200 --> 2:40:06.360]  as you can see the right is still concerned with acceptance from leftist media isn't that
[2:40:06.360 --> 2:40:11.640]  isn't that going against being a free thinker going against everything kanya west says everything
[2:40:11.640 --> 2:40:18.280]  that we've been fighting for goes against freedom of speech well and you just said it all that this
[2:40:18.280 --> 2:40:23.720]  is the answer that they're under conservatives are still under a trance and care what cnn and msnbc
[2:40:23.720 --> 2:40:28.600]  says about them and and i guess it's true because they can gang up and totally ban people look what
[2:40:28.600 --> 2:40:33.720]  they've done to me but aren't we gonna stand up against this isn't that the threat this was the
[2:40:33.720 --> 2:40:40.840]  opportunity to stand up against them putting hotel jesus on that stage as a speaker would have been a
[2:40:40.840 --> 2:40:46.760]  great way to stand up to them to prove that you are actually for freedom of speech but as you can
[2:40:46.760 --> 2:40:53.560]  see it seems like these conservative ink players because that's what they are only want to see that
[2:40:53.560 --> 2:41:00.040]  the table exactly oh you just crystallize it always mean to say that i've never said it they
[2:41:00.040 --> 2:41:04.040]  think i want to be on fox news they think i want to be part of the power structure no i want to
[2:41:04.040 --> 2:41:09.160]  overturn the whole thing it's parasitic it's out of control i want real freedom i don't want their
[2:41:09.160 --> 2:41:13.640]  whole globalist system but they try to corrupt our children and poison us and all this crap no
[2:41:13.640 --> 2:41:20.680]  i don't want your system i want to destroy your corrupt system hey that's exactly it if we're not
[2:41:20.680 --> 2:41:25.560]  toppling the system you know that's what made trump so great him being in there toppled the system
[2:41:25.560 --> 2:41:32.200]  they kind of got a more balance and that's what we want but it seems like these people at tpusa
[2:41:33.720 --> 2:41:38.920]  they don't really hate the left they just want to stand next to them they just want that media
[2:41:38.920 --> 2:41:43.640]  acceptance and they haven't defended people like info wars and alex jones enough well i'll give some
[2:41:43.640 --> 2:41:51.880]  inside baseball out kandace owens has dinner and hangs out a lot with uh jack dorsy and he knows
[2:41:51.880 --> 2:41:56.200]  debt trump likes her he knows that she talks to you know the highest people in the administration
[2:41:56.200 --> 2:42:02.120]  all the time and so just so there's no regulation he sits there and like lets her operate and
[2:42:02.120 --> 2:42:06.920]  promotes her tweets and everything and i like kandace but that's just replacing one form of
[2:42:06.920 --> 2:42:12.920]  tyranny with another and it's it's it's look i know it's people want to see at the table they
[2:42:12.920 --> 2:42:16.680]  want to feel like they're included but i think people shell out who they really are about doing that
[2:42:18.360 --> 2:42:23.160]  absolutely it goes against everything blucks it stands for i like kandace i have a lot of love
[2:42:23.160 --> 2:42:32.680]  for her but i think that it's misingenuous this disingenuous i'm sorry to say that we free when
[2:42:32.680 --> 2:42:38.280]  hotel jesus is banned when we come back they didn't give you any reason they just said oh the optics
[2:42:38.280 --> 2:42:44.680]  it's the optics uh as per brandon tatum i have a a tape for sale if anybody wants to take out
[2:42:44.680 --> 2:42:49.240]  the conversation with me and brandon tatum you can have and you can see exactly why they ban me
[2:42:51.640 --> 2:42:56.280]  i like random tatum too i didn't know he was involved in this it's really hard to have the
[2:42:56.280 --> 2:43:01.880]  energy at the end of the day to still get to the gym or to go for a run or go to the park or

[2:47:15.400 --> 2:47:24.600]  big brother big brother mainstream media government coverups you want to stop tyranny
[2:47:24.600 --> 2:47:31.000]  well so does he live from the info wars dot com studios it's alex jones
[2:47:32.440 --> 2:47:37.560]  so i really want freedom and and and i didn't mean to start this interview off getting into
[2:47:37.560 --> 2:47:42.040]  our guest being banned because i was already wanting to get him on the time we were getting him on
[2:47:42.040 --> 2:47:49.800]  and and uh to to come back and then uh he'd he'd been set up for the uh young conservative
[2:47:49.800 --> 2:47:56.600]  a black meeting that they had there at the white house so successful and then to learn why uh they
[2:47:56.600 --> 2:47:59.640]  did it well it's the optics because of some of the things you've said or they can be taken
[2:47:59.640 --> 2:48:05.480]  out of context it's just crazy i mean the left doesn't disavow lewis fair con the left doesn't
[2:48:05.480 --> 2:48:11.400]  disavow bill errs and and i'm not comparing with two guys with each other the point is is that
[2:48:11.400 --> 2:48:15.560]  the right needs to stop being such wimps i don't even call myself the right we're trying to take
[2:48:15.560 --> 2:48:20.520]  the government back and insurrection through the tea party and and and through trump and you
[2:48:20.520 --> 2:48:24.600]  see the country turning around in many ways because we've been artificially suppressed
[2:48:24.600 --> 2:48:28.840]  and so now americans are basically bargaining with the establishment for better treatment i
[2:48:28.840 --> 2:48:32.760]  want to go beyond that but hope that if you were getting into meeting with ganye a few years ago
[2:48:32.760 --> 2:48:36.840]  and how they're trying to suppress him uh how i don't want to get into the details but he's
[2:48:36.840 --> 2:48:42.520]  tried to come meet with me he's tried to set it up and then literally his people basically threatened
[2:48:42.520 --> 2:48:45.960]  to you know try to throw him back in a mental institution remember a year and a half ago when
[2:48:45.960 --> 2:48:51.000]  he endorsed trump he said he thought trump was great at a concert they grabbed him and did a
[2:48:51.000 --> 2:48:54.600]  baker act you can do that to anybody and threw him in a mental institution for a week and he got
[2:48:54.600 --> 2:48:59.480]  out because he's fine he made billions of dollars on his own he has more talent and is pinky than
[2:48:59.480 --> 2:49:04.920]  all those handlers do but just the idea that he is a captive himself to a certain extent it's just
[2:49:04.920 --> 2:49:11.160]  crazy oh it's absolutely insane my heart goes out to kanye he's been a free thinker for you know
[2:49:11.160 --> 2:49:14.920]  since i've been listening to his music and i've known him as a person i've been a great fan like
[2:49:14.920 --> 2:49:19.080]  i told you i met with kanye uh when i worked with 50 said a few years ago and you know he
[2:49:19.080 --> 2:49:24.200]  worked around with a team of at least seven eight d um it seemed like a really strong team
[2:49:24.200 --> 2:49:30.520]  he seemed like a really smart dude passionate dude very authentic very loving um but even him
[2:49:30.520 --> 2:49:37.240]  the great kanye is still being i guess we can say governed but i don't mean governed as in far as
[2:49:37.240 --> 2:49:43.640]  just a system above him but as a governor on a automobile to make it slow down you know they
[2:49:43.640 --> 2:49:49.400]  there are people trying to impede his progress exactly they've got balls and change time to his
[2:49:49.400 --> 2:49:56.280]  legs yeah yeah that's exactly what it is man because you know like you said when you talk about
[2:49:56.280 --> 2:50:01.320]  his rant about jay-z and you know trump and when they try to put him in the mental institution
[2:50:01.320 --> 2:50:06.760]  it's not that what he's saying is crazy what he's saying is just not what people are used to hearing
[2:50:06.760 --> 2:50:12.840]  therefore it makes it abnormally crazy but what he's saying is what millions of people are thinking
[2:50:12.840 --> 2:50:17.400]  and are afraid to say because they don't want to be attacked they don't want to be banned
[2:50:17.400 --> 2:50:23.880]  from opportunities throughout life and that's it to watch people grovel to the system even
[2:50:23.880 --> 2:50:28.920]  though they know it's not right because they want to curry favor and they want their global
[2:50:28.920 --> 2:50:33.400]  social score online to say they're bowing down well as soon as you bow down to evil
[2:50:33.400 --> 2:50:39.240]  to little evil it's a slippery slope and now all the big tech companies are helping china
[2:50:39.240 --> 2:50:44.520]  arrest buddhist and christians and killing them so i mean that just shows how far they'll go
[2:50:45.080 --> 2:50:51.400]  these tech heads will do anything i mean isn't it quite odd that we've had these recent tragedies
[2:50:51.400 --> 2:50:57.160]  in the media one of them you called about this cnn committing a false flag against themselves
[2:50:57.160 --> 2:51:03.240]  um but i think it was ironic how the timing of that coincided with this black meeting and also
[2:51:04.200 --> 2:51:08.520]  walk away the walk away event and i find it quite strange that that stuff popped up and
[2:51:08.520 --> 2:51:14.840]  overshadowed some of the things that could have been great for the uh maga maga movement but um
[2:51:14.840 --> 2:51:19.480]  yeah it's strange times we're living in here and people like us got to be careful all right i've
[2:51:19.480 --> 2:51:23.000]  been asking some questions here but you've always got great points you're making yourself
[2:51:23.000 --> 2:51:29.000]  what's front and center for you right now what's on hotep jesus's radar all my radar right now is
[2:51:29.560 --> 2:51:33.560]  i see i wonder if i should say this all right i'm going to say it in a different way
[2:51:33.560 --> 2:51:39.880]  i think we need to empower right wing venture capital and we need to empower right wing tech
[2:51:39.880 --> 2:51:45.000]  we have to start building software we have to start building hardware machines ai we have to
[2:51:45.000 --> 2:51:50.280]  get into drone game right now drones are being controlled by um an asian company called dji and
[2:51:50.280 --> 2:51:54.520]  drones are going to be uh you know surveilling our skies they're going to be a part of our life
[2:51:54.520 --> 2:51:58.680]  they're going to be delivering our packages going to be delivering our food and when you see things
[2:51:58.680 --> 2:52:04.360]  like uh asian companies putting bugs and apple phones and uh you know apple computers and able
[2:52:04.360 --> 2:52:08.680]  to intercept messages from our government now now take that and multiply it by the millions of
[2:52:08.680 --> 2:52:13.880]  drones that would be flying our skies we have to start manufacturing things uh in the technology
[2:52:13.880 --> 2:52:17.640]  space of our own we have to start controlling venture capital because all the venture venture
[2:52:17.640 --> 2:52:24.120]  capital is going to left wing corporations 40 of every single uh venture capital dollar goes back
[2:52:24.120 --> 2:52:29.960]  to youtube uh actually google and facebook so we have to start creating new advertising channels
[2:52:29.960 --> 2:52:34.520]  and supporting people like you and getting on the blockchain etc etc but that's that's my focus
[2:52:34.520 --> 2:52:40.200]  right now is tech and vc oh man are you right there's this giant tech revolution and robot
[2:52:40.200 --> 2:52:44.840]  revolution to replace us and drone revolution and just like eisenhower warned about the military
[2:52:44.840 --> 2:52:50.920]  industrial complex and and the university complexes we first said you as you said google and alphabet
[2:52:50.920 --> 2:52:57.160]  these companies they're the new darpa and they're doing it all for control and all to displace people
[2:52:57.160 --> 2:53:02.200]  and then china who shown that they'll suppress their people like nobody else they've killed
[2:53:02.200 --> 2:53:08.200]  five times what hitler did and we're just totally embracing it and they treat their people like
[2:53:08.200 --> 2:53:13.640]  lower than crap and so that shows the great sucking sound like ross perot said we're all
[2:53:13.640 --> 2:53:21.960]  going down to that level yeah i if you look at the uh netflix uh show uh black mirror there's
[2:53:21.960 --> 2:53:27.000]  one on there about uh living your life uh through social media and you know you had a radio score
[2:53:27.000 --> 2:53:31.560]  from one through five and if you're a five you're afforded more privileges and that's the case right
[2:53:31.560 --> 2:53:36.040]  now i believe in china where if you don't have a certain social status you don't even get i think
[2:53:36.040 --> 2:53:41.720]  access to a passport and i look at china and i look at the uk and europe as testing grounds we
[2:53:41.720 --> 2:53:48.520]  do it in marketing we test in you know uh third third markets and um you know i think those are
[2:53:48.520 --> 2:53:51.560]  testing markets for what they want to bring here to the you know that you're absolutely right they
[2:53:51.560 --> 2:53:56.600]  admit that and so imagine folks oh you don't do what we want socially you can't have a job at
[2:53:56.600 --> 2:54:00.760]  bank account you can't fly but see you're like well i'll just comply but they can always ratchet it
[2:54:00.760 --> 2:54:05.480]  up which they do once you comply the sky's the limit hotel where do you think they want to take us
[2:54:05.480 --> 2:54:12.840]  where's the end game of this system castle society world government sounds like revelations to me yeah
[2:54:12.840 --> 2:54:19.480]  all of that um end game it looks similar to the terminator movies when we think about drones and
[2:54:19.480 --> 2:54:24.920]  we think about ai we think about robotics like we see coming out of boston dynamics i think we're
[2:54:24.920 --> 2:54:32.760]  going to see a real technology revolution and i see man versus machine just like all of the you
[2:54:32.760 --> 2:54:38.200]  know matrix movies have talked about um we're going to see that but in a very real way um back
[2:54:38.200 --> 2:54:44.440]  to the future was definitely on point in some aspects but i think it's going to be um you know
[2:54:44.440 --> 2:54:50.760]  you're either one with the bots or you're going to be oppressed like really bad and i think that
[2:54:50.760 --> 2:54:55.960]  we're going to see you're going to see uh underground bots you know that could be drones that are
[2:54:55.960 --> 2:55:03.400]  detached from the system or or what do you call it jailbroken um we're going to see um uh the the
[2:55:03.400 --> 2:55:09.320]  underground internet you know with the the uh deep platforming of info wars the deep platforming of
[2:55:09.320 --> 2:55:15.000]  gab i think we're going to have a huge thing happening either on the deep web or the blockchain
[2:55:15.000 --> 2:55:20.520]  new internet trying to create something but i think we're going to go into that now socially
[2:55:20.520 --> 2:55:25.240]  we're going to go into a place that's like demolition man where you say a curse and then a ticket
[2:55:25.240 --> 2:55:31.880]  pops out of machine yeah that's their plan exactly yeah and then then there's that whole
[2:55:31.880 --> 2:55:36.040]  chip thing right that everybody's not paying attention to and we've almost forgotten so
[2:55:36.040 --> 2:55:40.040]  everybody's going to be chips and now they admit the world government plan is that and then so what's
[2:55:40.040 --> 2:55:48.520]  the in game after that though the in game after that is complete mpc mind state so there's another
[2:55:48.520 --> 2:55:53.000]  movie i want to say it's equilibrium and it's completely didn't desensitize people to not
[2:55:53.000 --> 2:55:59.800]  even feel anymore and just turn people into robots that's it exactly the robots take over by making
[2:55:59.800 --> 2:56:05.000]  us robots yeah yeah and i think that's what's going to happen because and then you're going to have
[2:56:05.000 --> 2:56:11.960]  the underground people who just are uh unlocked detached and and and not of that mpc mind but
[2:56:11.960 --> 2:56:15.480]  the people are going to be the new mpc mind they're going to be the hive mind and that's what
[2:56:15.480 --> 2:56:20.120]  they're going to use as the force of the police force or the social force to keep the rest of us
[2:56:20.120 --> 2:56:27.720]  in check just like they do now with the tpusa band of hoats at jesus and again oh sounds reasonable
[2:56:27.720 --> 2:56:33.320]  and then it's more and more and more and more and more and more and more and it's it's it's
[2:56:33.320 --> 2:56:37.400]  it's crazy we're gonna break it into five more minutes for you but i want to ask you this question
[2:56:39.400 --> 2:56:43.400]  obviously that this fake pipe bombs they're fake the whole thing just stinks it's right out of
[2:56:43.400 --> 2:56:49.480]  hollywood but the jewish center that gets even crazier we've seen the pre-programming i don't know
[2:56:51.080 --> 2:56:54.600]  i don't know exactly what's wrong with all this but you just look at the whole picture something
[2:56:54.600 --> 2:57:02.200]  is synthetic here oh absolutely as soon as the thing hit you know i put my tenfold hat on i said
[2:57:02.200 --> 2:57:07.960]  what would alex jones say and sure enough he'd say it's a false flag and i thought the same thing
[2:57:07.960 --> 2:57:12.440]  i didn't think anything else it was just suspicious that this thing will pop up and like i said i
[2:57:12.440 --> 2:57:15.880]  thought it was funny that it coincided with the black leadership summit at the white house
[2:57:15.880 --> 2:57:21.960]  with trump and it coincided with uh you know even trump had to give his uh announcement of catching
[2:57:21.960 --> 2:57:28.840]  the uh whoever the guy was allegedly was stare at the exactly all that was meant to overshadow
[2:57:29.480 --> 2:57:34.760]  the the the blig zit and and and and and and and black folks waking up tonight be republican
[2:57:34.760 --> 2:57:39.800]  just get off the democrat plantation i mean my god that is the kkk folks the democrats are

[3:00:16.120 --> 3:00:21.080]  so basically like tanya west says we're already reached the point of unlimited energy they've
[3:00:21.080 --> 3:00:25.160]  already suppressed all these technologies on record and their only hope is to play us off against
[3:00:25.160 --> 3:00:30.360]  each other so the establishment can try to get live assistant technology and then go to a type
[3:00:30.360 --> 3:00:36.920]  one civilization and we've just been seen as wreckage or like boosters on a rocket that are obsolete
[3:00:36.920 --> 3:00:41.480]  why don't like an establishment saying i'm obsolete and believe me folks it's beyond racism as you
[3:00:41.480 --> 3:00:47.640]  think of it it's it's an elitism to take control of human development and destroy us so they can
[3:00:47.640 --> 3:00:52.760]  be better than us and that's the final equation of the globalist and you join them you lose your
[3:00:52.760 --> 3:00:57.720]  soul hotep do it for a full hour in the near future and take some calls uh we've got a guest
[3:00:57.720 --> 3:01:03.080]  host oan benjamin of huge pianist dot com joining us your websites are books by brian dot com and
[3:01:03.080 --> 3:01:09.880]  hotep nation dot com on twitter for now at uh vibe high but just big pictures i was asking
[3:01:09.880 --> 3:01:13.800]  looking at these events and the violence and they're saying trump and all shows are caused
[3:01:13.800 --> 3:01:17.800]  violence and then and then it's the media doing it you can see the pre-programming and with eight
[3:01:17.800 --> 3:01:24.600]  days out i just cringe every hour wondering what nutball they've got on a short leash programmed
[3:01:24.600 --> 3:01:29.000]  ready to be released because i think what we've seen is just drip drip it gets bigger bigger
[3:01:29.000 --> 3:01:32.680]  you know each event i i think we're going to see some really bad stuff like that guy that
[3:01:32.680 --> 3:01:37.560]  wanted to blow up the uh washington monument 200 pounds of explosives that got caught i i just got
[3:01:37.560 --> 3:01:46.600]  level at a spiritual level i'm like danger will robinson ha ha ha absolutely um i think um this
[3:01:46.600 --> 3:01:50.440]  comes down to i said it this morning these events like we have a school shooting happening right
[3:01:50.440 --> 3:01:56.200]  now and i said i find it quite odd that there's a tragedy inflation always around election time
[3:01:57.320 --> 3:02:04.440]  and there's this book i read uh before it's tv news i believe i forget the author but um he basically
[3:02:04.440 --> 3:02:09.800]  says the media can create a uh crime sprain chrisprick crime spree or whatever they want
[3:02:09.800 --> 3:02:15.240]  anytime they want just by reporting on crimes that happen every single day so what we have is uh
[3:02:15.240 --> 3:02:19.880]  like you always say fair monitoring using the media to scare especially mind control they can put
[3:02:19.880 --> 3:02:24.920]  out a message that all the coca-cola selling out everyone goes and grabs it or all the water
[3:02:24.920 --> 3:02:28.760]  selling out or people are jumping off the imparts taste building they start doing it so it's it's
[3:02:28.760 --> 3:02:34.200]  really a form of mind control oh it's absolutely mind control is mind control mind conditioning
[3:02:34.200 --> 3:02:40.040]  mind numbing all of that stuff if you wouldn't have been banned from the young black leadership
[3:02:40.040 --> 3:02:46.040]  conference uh that was so successful what would you have said just in a few minutes if i hadn't
[3:02:46.040 --> 3:02:49.640]  been banned what do you mean i mean you're not getting banned now this is what you would have said
[3:02:50.840 --> 3:02:56.120]  if you'd have made it there oh if i would have made it there on that stage i would have said i
[3:02:56.120 --> 3:03:05.880]  had his feet ready and it started out with we want our guns we want our right to speech you
[3:03:05.880 --> 3:03:10.680]  know those are the two things i stand behind you know and then lastly it's just love not the fake
[3:03:10.680 --> 3:03:17.960]  love that the left puts out there you know that real love but um america is it's the wild wild west
[3:03:17.960 --> 3:03:23.800]  it's uh amusement park it is ar it's augmented reality you can do whatever you want in this crazy
[3:03:23.800 --> 3:03:30.680]  country um and i think that the people that put that constitution in place did a pretty good job
[3:03:31.240 --> 3:03:35.640]  and the people that are tearing it down are going to take america from you know how great it is
[3:03:36.600 --> 3:03:41.480]  to something that's just going to really suck it's just not going to be fun that's what makes
[3:03:41.480 --> 3:03:45.800]  america great you know all the good and bad it comes with it end of the day america is fun
[3:03:45.800 --> 3:03:49.880]  you don't even have to watch tv you can just watch politics and have fun you can watch people
[3:03:49.880 --> 3:03:55.720]  and have fun you can just you know just life here is fun whereas other places like uh you know
[3:03:56.280 --> 3:04:01.960]  actually i don't want to let me not do that you don't want to be mean but they're very homogenous
[3:04:01.960 --> 3:04:08.840]  and it's it's very robotic yeah yeah america is not robotic america's wild wild west and we want
[3:04:08.840 --> 3:04:14.680]  that yeah i think that's fun man let's be honest it can be funny it can be happy it can be dangerous
[3:04:14.680 --> 3:04:18.920]  it can be scary it can be violent but it is it's where everybody wanted to get because there was
[3:04:18.920 --> 3:04:23.400]  something called freedom giving it was some perfect perfect freedom but they want to demonize it because
[3:04:23.400 --> 3:04:29.720]  it's got a potential that will destroy their whole system of control that's exactly it man they don't
[3:04:29.720 --> 3:04:33.800]  want control and we're unpredictable they can't control us so the only thing they can do is try
[3:04:33.800 --> 3:04:38.920]  to suppress us that's right hotep jesus come back soon for a full hour give that full speech

[3:09:52.440 --> 3:09:57.960]  it is with information and your speech and your action the first amendment which is under assault
[3:09:57.960 --> 3:10:02.200]  okay oh and i'm gonna let you take over i'll keep interrupting thanks for hosting you got uh
[3:10:02.200 --> 3:10:10.760]  50 minutes left god bless yeah what you were just talking about is very true that the first and
[3:10:10.760 --> 3:10:15.800]  second amendment are very important to stay away from violence because people usually commit acts
[3:10:15.800 --> 3:10:21.000]  of violence when they have nothing left and so talking it out is the best thing to do so right
[3:10:21.000 --> 3:10:26.760]  now i want to talk i want to break down barack obama's last tweet in regards to the synagogue
[3:10:26.760 --> 3:10:30.520]  shooting then i want to talk a little bit about halloween costumes i'm going to play a clip
[3:10:30.520 --> 3:10:37.240]  of a stand-up bit i did two years ago that kind of predicted a lot of this nonsense i think honest
[3:10:37.240 --> 3:10:44.280]  comedy is is oddly predicts the future there's like a time travel element with it and then a song
[3:10:44.280 --> 3:10:49.560]  that me and some of the some of the unbearables on my live stream wrote for tommy robinson when he
[3:10:49.560 --> 3:10:56.120]  first went to jail there's a really cool video of the streets of of london or the streets i don't
[3:10:56.120 --> 3:11:00.360]  know what city it was in but just thousands of people singing it to him when he got out of jail
[3:11:00.360 --> 3:11:06.040]  and he gave us a shout out and i just want to show the power of um the individual over tyranny
[3:11:06.040 --> 3:11:11.640]  and i'll show you an example with me and tommy robinson that just happened so first i want to
[3:11:11.640 --> 3:11:19.000]  talk about barack obama's last tweet my father teaches rhetoric like uh how to persuasion how
[3:11:19.000 --> 3:11:26.520]  to form arguments he's a college professor about um he teaches communication studies so i i've known
[3:11:26.520 --> 3:11:31.800]  since i was a child how words work and how arguments work and i thought i could help people
[3:11:31.800 --> 3:11:38.440]  understand how these sophists how these wizards these magicians use words to manipulate people
[3:11:38.440 --> 3:11:45.480]  so barack obama just tweeted we grief for the americans murdered in pittsburgh all of us have
[3:11:45.480 --> 3:11:50.920]  to fight the rise of anti-semitism and hateful rhetoric against those who look or love or pray
[3:11:50.920 --> 3:11:58.200]  differently we have to stop making it so easy those who want to harm the innocent get their
[3:11:58.200 --> 3:12:07.720]  hands on a gun okay so on the surface that appears to be uh a nice compassionate american tweet in
[3:12:07.720 --> 3:12:14.120]  response to uh a tragedy but in reality it's the exact opposite so i'll show you how it works so
[3:12:14.120 --> 3:12:22.840]  first he says we we is is something called assumed um what uh assumed consensus we i i don't i i don't
[3:12:22.840 --> 3:12:27.400]  give permission for barack obama to speak on my behalf i don't know about you and also he's friends
[3:12:27.400 --> 3:12:33.640]  with lewis ferrican who calls jews termites and is praised ate off hitler so when he says we he
[3:12:33.640 --> 3:12:38.920]  isn't even talking about him and his friends or me it's a trick it's assumed consensus you know
[3:12:38.920 --> 3:12:45.320]  it's kind of like when you're trying to um insult someone you say uh you smell bad everyone thinks
[3:12:45.320 --> 3:12:49.000]  so like everyone talks about how much you like you're known for being the guy who smells bad
[3:12:49.960 --> 3:12:53.240]  you can just that makes you feel even worse than if someone just says you smell bad because
[3:12:53.240 --> 3:12:57.880]  it's something called assumed consensus so we agree for the americans murdered in pittsburgh
[3:12:57.880 --> 3:13:03.320]  and then next he says all of us have to fight the rise of anti-semitism and hateful rhetoric
[3:13:03.320 --> 3:13:09.960]  against those who look who look or pray differently or well differently or whatever okay this is this
[3:13:09.960 --> 3:13:16.200]  is some fantastically manipulative stuff here all right so first of all all of us are not responsible
[3:13:16.200 --> 3:13:22.840]  for the rise of anti-semitism in america uh who is not responsible people who aren't anti-semites
[3:13:23.640 --> 3:13:29.480]  hollywood would do the same thing after one of their famous um soyboy rapes they would always
[3:13:29.480 --> 3:13:36.600]  say we are responsible for rape we have to be better at protecting women i don't know about you
[3:13:36.600 --> 3:13:42.520]  but i do a great job protecting women specifically my wife i've never raped anyone i'm guessing you
[3:13:42.520 --> 3:13:49.400]  haven't either what this is it's people who say that they're trying to devalue the currency of
[3:13:49.400 --> 3:13:53.320]  shame by flooding the market with it it's just like supply and demand market economics right
[3:13:53.320 --> 3:13:59.080]  they do it with shame so if everyone should be ashamed then you can't pick out who really should
[3:13:59.080 --> 3:14:04.360]  be ashamed i hope you guys find this interesting i find it really interesting no no you're every
[3:14:04.360 --> 3:14:09.880]  segment of this is the brainwashing when he actually funded the arab spring is anti-israel
[3:14:09.880 --> 3:14:15.720]  himself he's actually the anti-semite he's actually the radical islamists and then he's using group
[3:14:15.720 --> 3:14:20.040]  things saying we all agree and that we're all guilty like in the old soviet union if the guy
[3:14:20.040 --> 3:14:25.640]  down the block shot the secret police you get five years in a gulag so it's this collective guilt
[3:14:25.640 --> 3:14:30.920]  like look a crazy person did something you're guilty well no there's always been crazy bad people
[3:14:30.920 --> 3:14:37.320]  there's seven and a half billion of us anybody that says we can never allow one murder again
[3:14:37.320 --> 3:14:42.440]  and you're all guilty that's like oh you're putting me in a cage that i'm gonna be a slave
[3:14:42.440 --> 3:14:46.760]  that i'm your slave forever and i'm gonna follow all your orders and do whatever you say forever
[3:14:46.760 --> 3:14:51.720]  because you just associated me with somebody else i'm an individual and you're a cult leader
[3:14:51.720 --> 3:14:56.680]  yeah and it takes away personal accountability which is what all abusive people inevitably
[3:14:56.680 --> 3:15:01.400]  want to do and the and the and the the nail in the coffin is the end to keep their hands
[3:15:01.400 --> 3:15:07.000]  off of guns they never tried to get rid of fake pipes and weird powder and and post offices when
[3:15:07.000 --> 3:15:13.080]  that that that fraudulent pipe thing just happened no they're trying to get rid of your guns so that
[3:15:13.080 --> 3:15:17.320]  they can get rid of your speech and they can get rid of your property rights and they all did it
[3:15:17.320 --> 3:15:22.600]  under the guise of compassion look at how this is structured brock obama is an anti-semite right so
[3:15:22.600 --> 3:15:27.480]  now he's saying we're all anti-semites people who pray differently so if someone prays to satan
[3:15:27.480 --> 3:15:33.240]  that's the same as god that's madness so if someone is covered he said you can't even question other
[3:15:33.240 --> 3:15:37.320]  religions he's equating that with violence he's creating a bit of cult stay there i'm gonna let
[3:15:37.320 --> 3:15:41.800]  you take over it's all riveting don't invite me to pop in there oh and i'm gonna take over no i love

[3:17:57.160 --> 3:18:02.840]  really is the real drama can be found here in leilani estates but a lot of us on the big island
[3:18:02.840 --> 3:18:09.320]  rely on rainwater and we need to be concerned about ash and acid rain volcanic ash may contain
[3:18:09.320 --> 3:18:15.640]  heavy metal particles and acid rain could lower the pH of the water to unhealthy levels to find
[3:18:15.640 --> 3:18:22.600]  out we employed a series of tests for heavy metals alkalinity and pH what we learned was that there
[3:18:22.600 --> 3:18:28.760]  was in fact unhealthy levels of heavy metals and acidity in the rainwater next we tested the water
[3:18:28.760 --> 3:18:34.600]  from our alexa pure gravity filter and not only were the heavy metal levels within safe measure
[3:18:34.600 --> 3:18:41.400]  but the pH was also restored to optimal levels as it turns out the filter on the alexa pure
[3:18:41.400 --> 3:18:47.560]  raises the pH of the water so what we've learned is that volcanic ash and acid rain can contaminate
[3:18:47.560 --> 3:18:53.240]  a rainwater supply but more importantly a good water filtration system will purify it

[3:20:27.080 --> 3:20:31.800]  with feather fly together oan benjamin huge pianist that's not the ding-dong word that's
[3:20:31.800 --> 3:20:37.960]  pianist like pianist it's a big guy and he plays a piano some breaking news big article
[3:20:37.960 --> 3:20:43.240]  documents released by judicial watch more of them prove george soros behind illegal alien caravan
[3:20:43.240 --> 3:20:48.760]  that has trump sending 5 000 troops to augment the national guard and regular army on the border
[3:20:48.760 --> 3:20:55.480]  so that's getting out of control and that big beto or or uh mural they got national attention
[3:20:55.480 --> 3:20:59.240]  we didn't do it i'll be honest i thought about it but i said that's free speech i'm not doing it
[3:20:59.240 --> 3:21:03.960]  because it was on somebody's private building downtown the commies the local antifa said don't
[3:21:03.960 --> 3:21:09.000]  vote revolt and that's they do that everywhere they attack like cat sanctuary's of white people
[3:21:09.000 --> 3:21:14.200]  own it you name it that's white antifa doing that they'll walk up go after you white piece of crap
[3:21:14.200 --> 3:21:21.400]  you gender it's like all white methods uh but uh vote now love trumps hate somebody hung that over
[3:21:21.400 --> 3:21:25.720]  so now it's become like a pissing post in downtown austin i'm gonna have to go down there and do a
[3:21:25.720 --> 3:21:32.280]  live report from there anyways back to oan benjamin thank you ox that was awesome uh i just wanted
[3:21:32.280 --> 3:21:37.160]  to play you guys a clip because uh the great tommy robinson for those of you that don't know he uh
[3:21:37.800 --> 3:21:45.960]  was reporting on these grooming sex rape gangs in in his hometown of roderdam um england and
[3:21:45.960 --> 3:21:51.000]  they were they were going into there were being the the what was it called the trial was happening and
[3:21:51.000 --> 3:21:55.880]  he was reporting on it so they put him in prison and me and a bunch of the unbearables on the
[3:21:55.880 --> 3:22:01.720]  live stream wrote him a song okay the song started taken off and then some of his guys saw it and then
[3:22:01.720 --> 3:22:07.720]  they uh started handing out flyers with the lyrics on it and as tommy comes out of prison
[3:22:07.720 --> 3:22:12.120]  they like there's people singing it in the streets and the reason i want to show you guys this
[3:22:12.120 --> 3:22:16.840]  is because there's a reason authoritarians hate the individual because the individual
[3:22:16.840 --> 3:22:21.400]  can overcome them just by not kneeling and not submitting so if you guys want to check
[3:22:21.400 --> 3:22:25.800]  this out this is a pretty powerful um example of of people coming together
[3:22:25.800 --> 3:22:46.760]  yes so it was a song called how they rule you and i first started coming up with it and then
[3:22:46.760 --> 3:22:51.080]  but a bunch of other people came up with great lines in it and i have a big enough platform
[3:22:51.080 --> 3:22:56.200]  where it could spread and then i played it live once and uh before you know it thousands of people
[3:22:56.200 --> 3:23:02.120]  are singing it and it sends a shiver down the spine of the eu that think they can just keep pumping
[3:23:02.120 --> 3:23:07.720]  these strangers into their communities without anyone having any justice for rapists and gang
[3:23:07.720 --> 3:23:14.920]  rapists and pedophiles and so that's just one dude with a live stream capability in a piano if we
[3:23:14.920 --> 3:23:20.680]  live in a nation of individuals that can happen all the time and so when you have the these obama
[3:23:20.680 --> 3:23:26.040]  type people that that want you to have no personal accountability that if one person commits a crime
[3:23:26.040 --> 3:23:31.080]  we all did if one person commits a violent act all their enemies did and we all did and we all
[3:23:31.080 --> 3:23:34.840]  have to have collective guilt and collective punishment based on things that we did not do
[3:23:36.040 --> 3:23:42.520]  that is a way for monsters to hide it's an inverse it's the upside down i so as a comedian
[3:23:43.320 --> 3:23:48.600]  i like to show people exactly what the leftist world would really look like if you took it to its
[3:23:48.600 --> 3:23:54.360]  end conclusion like for example there would be no health so here's a video i made called leftist
[3:23:54.360 --> 3:24:01.800]  fitness instructor you guys have it we did leftist instructor that's an amazing video
[3:24:02.600 --> 3:24:09.480]  oh thanks yeah they have it while they're doing that uh let me bring this up i'm glad i'm co-hosting
[3:24:09.480 --> 3:24:15.640]  now with you uh with elin benjamin of huge penis dot com i i i'd heard that clip i heard your name
[3:24:15.640 --> 3:24:19.560]  i didn't put it together i thought man that's a cool sounding song but it's a little bitty
[3:24:19.560 --> 3:24:25.160]  short clip uh hopefully we can pull that in later and and play the whole song tell us where we find
[3:24:25.160 --> 3:24:30.200]  that song that you came up with then like a meme people kind of added on to it made it even better
[3:24:30.200 --> 3:24:35.480]  tell us about that yeah yeah you can find that at youtube.com slash elin benjamin comedy or if
[3:24:35.480 --> 3:24:40.760]  you just look up elin benjamin how they rule you and people have covered it and it's expanded
[3:24:40.760 --> 3:24:45.320]  and um azra i can't remember his last name but someone tweeted that this song was written by
[3:24:45.320 --> 3:24:50.920]  elin benjamin of america so i changed my instagram name to elin benjamin of america because it sounded
[3:24:50.920 --> 3:24:56.120]  so formal and again people think of memes as just something funny to me a meme is something that people
[3:24:56.120 --> 3:25:00.760]  culturally pick up and then add things to come up to english language is this mongrel language
[3:25:00.760 --> 3:25:05.640]  it's real diversity and then it's just everybody just keeps innovating and and making it even better
[3:25:05.640 --> 3:25:10.840]  and then once a meme kind of peeks out then it dies for a while and then it gets innovated again
[3:25:10.840 --> 3:25:14.520]  it comes back like i've been involved in a bunch of memes that come in and out but but there it is
[3:25:14.520 --> 3:25:21.320]  song for tommy robinson 50 000 views uh on youtube elin benjamin uh how we rule yet we do have that
[3:25:21.320 --> 3:25:26.920]  clip now our computer was having a heart attack reintroduce what you were just saying oh so you
[3:25:26.920 --> 3:25:32.200]  can't function in a world that's why a lot of people uh go more on the right who are plumbers
[3:25:32.200 --> 3:25:37.560]  and carpenters and military and cops and comedians and engineers where you live in a world where things
[3:25:37.560 --> 3:25:42.600]  either work or don't work where you can't live in this gender study nonsense world fitness is one
[3:25:42.600 --> 3:25:47.400]  of those places so here is a uh a fitness video called leftist fitness instructor here it is
[3:25:51.560 --> 3:25:56.200]  unbearable production hi i'm elin benjamin i used to be an actual fitness instructor
[3:25:56.200 --> 3:26:01.320]  and i would focus on real world results but with the rise of leftism came a drop in the
[3:26:01.320 --> 3:26:08.280]  personal accountability needed for fitness that's when i started leftist fitness because as we all
[3:26:08.280 --> 3:26:17.240]  know it's not your fault your fat it's unconscious heteronormative behavior fat shaming straws
[3:26:18.200 --> 3:26:26.680]  the existence of monkeys white people my clients used to like yoga and tai chi but now we know we
[3:26:26.680 --> 3:26:32.760]  can't do those things it's white because it's cultural appropriation that's not your exercise
[3:26:32.760 --> 3:26:39.000]  white man it's only for the slants i recently had a 400 pound client fall down some stairs and
[3:26:39.000 --> 3:26:46.200]  break her hip she was relieved to find out that it was not her fault it's because gravity is rape
[3:26:46.200 --> 3:26:56.920]  leftist fitness diabetes is a pejorative it's now called livabedes yes right now i'm feeling
[3:26:56.920 --> 3:27:02.360]  a burn in my abdominals for the leftist fitness we just want you to feel a different kind of burn
[3:27:02.360 --> 3:27:08.360]  bernie sanders the communist agitator who's never had a job in the real world we know water is
[3:27:08.360 --> 3:27:11.800]  important all right so this look good it's good for several more minutes but i just want to show
[3:27:11.800 --> 3:27:17.000]  you i want to see more please yeah there's one there's one holding up false narratives where
[3:27:17.000 --> 3:27:23.960]  i'm just holding it's like russia collusion russia collusion it's it's you can't you can't function
[3:27:23.960 --> 3:27:30.040]  in that world where nothing's your fault and and and also changing words to avoid any accountability
[3:27:30.040 --> 3:27:34.520]  where instead of diabetes you call it livabedes like your foot's still going to fall off whatever
[3:27:34.520 --> 3:27:38.440]  you call it and i think that that's something that people have to understand that this wizardry
[3:27:38.440 --> 3:27:45.320]  this this these magic tricks that obama made so prevalent um if they don't last and then your house
[3:27:45.320 --> 3:27:50.760]  will still fall down no matter what you call it oh no way that's hilarious and by the way if you
[3:27:50.760 --> 3:27:56.200]  don't think that rithbader ginsberg is super sexy and hot you know what you are you're you're you're
[3:27:56.200 --> 3:28:02.600]  an anti feminist yeah you're an agist and you're an ugliest that means you're against ugly like it
[3:28:02.600 --> 3:28:07.240]  means you're you just turn against ugly yeah because it's true discrimination became a bad word
[3:28:07.240 --> 3:28:12.600]  but it's a great word it like i discriminate i only have i only have sex with one woman that's

[3:35:12.600 --> 3:35:20.600]  host and i want to talk about uh halloween because halloween my wife loves halloween and my kids
[3:35:20.600 --> 3:35:26.440]  well one of my kids is just a baby so i don't know what he likes yet uh he still just really likes my
[3:35:26.440 --> 3:35:34.120]  wife's breasts and sleep but my other son walter who's uh two and a half now is all about halloween
[3:35:34.120 --> 3:35:38.920]  and so is my wife we're all dressed as uh dinosaurs i looked like godzilla and i ate a lot of cupcakes
[3:35:38.920 --> 3:35:46.200]  but the point i'm trying to make is there's a lot of leftist nonsense about what you can and cannot
[3:35:46.200 --> 3:35:51.400]  dress as for halloween and the thing about honest comedy is honest comedy predicts things
[3:35:51.400 --> 3:35:57.480]  because what we see is what things people would laugh at is usually a year or two ahead of the
[3:35:57.480 --> 3:36:02.280]  curve of what uh people are going to roll out into the general population so here's a clip from two
[3:36:02.280 --> 3:36:11.960]  years ago that i did on halloween costumes check this out yeah halloween was intense everyone had
[3:36:11.960 --> 3:36:17.880]  outrage because of outfits like the big thing around college campuses was uh it's a it's a culture
[3:36:17.880 --> 3:36:23.400]  not a costume and so they get mad at white people wearing like uh sombreros or like those rice paddy
[3:36:23.400 --> 3:36:29.160]  hats or any of those big hats yeah i think it's way more racist to say that all mexicans wear sombreros
[3:36:29.160 --> 3:36:36.280]  do you understand my line of thinking where it's like don't wear the don't wear the sombrero
[3:36:36.280 --> 3:36:41.240]  because that's their hat it's like what do you think that's like their hat
[3:36:43.240 --> 3:36:47.640]  to say i want a sombrero i want a rice paddy hat because i don't like the sun
[3:36:47.640 --> 3:36:53.480]  that's a killer hat for white people you gotta have that big old brim and then i started thinking
[3:36:53.480 --> 3:37:00.200]  every costume is offensive to some group of people like everything like uh where wolves offend uh
[3:37:00.200 --> 3:37:11.560]  Armenian men and of course when women dress as sexy nurses Filipino moms get outraged that's their
[3:37:11.560 --> 3:37:20.120]  outfit not yours all right so huge pianist dot com if you want to get tickets to see me live now
[3:37:20.120 --> 3:37:27.400]  that you've seen how hilarious i am um so the Filipino mom nurse one is and the reason i used
[3:37:27.400 --> 3:37:33.160]  Armenians and uh Filipinos is because i was performing that bit in uh brea california so
[3:37:33.160 --> 3:37:39.080]  my audience was very Filipino and uh somewhat Armenian and Armenians are usually very good
[3:37:39.080 --> 3:37:45.560]  at taking jokes i didn't have to really overthink that one but uh an incredible amount of Filipino
[3:37:45.560 --> 3:37:50.760]  moms are in fact nurses and so a lot of people have always written me like this is unbelievable
[3:37:50.760 --> 3:37:57.160]  like i'm Filipino and my mom's a nurse i'm like yeah that's why Filipino dudes are so tough because
[3:37:57.160 --> 3:38:02.040]  their moms just keep patching them up for war but the the point i was really trying to make here
[3:38:02.040 --> 3:38:07.720]  is where does it end you know it seems like the left the authoritarians whatever you want to call
[3:38:07.720 --> 3:38:13.960]  them the ruling elite they have a list over who's protected at that moment it's usually based on some
[3:38:13.960 --> 3:38:19.560]  sort of uh dystopian future that they're trying to roll out for for us so a small amount of people
[3:38:19.560 --> 3:38:28.360]  can become incredibly wealthy and powerful and who you can and can't mock and so if i was like
[3:38:28.360 --> 3:38:35.640]  there is no outfit that that you can't that that should be off limits because everything would
[3:38:35.640 --> 3:38:41.080]  quote unquote offend someone the concept of offense is is mind-blowing if someone tells me they're
[3:38:41.080 --> 3:38:45.320]  offended i'm just like oh i'm sorry to hear how weak you are like i feel like they're kind of
[3:38:45.320 --> 3:38:49.560]  almost like opening up to me like admitting how weak they are it's almost like saying like that
[3:38:49.560 --> 3:38:53.800]  they have herpes or something where it's like hey man i i'm offended i'm like i'm so sorry that you
[3:38:53.800 --> 3:38:59.320]  were raised so badly and you're so weak uh because when you think about cultural appropriation all it
[3:38:59.320 --> 3:39:06.760]  does is it tries to put people into boxes and that's what globalists want to do if you look at
[3:39:06.760 --> 3:39:11.560]  agenda 21 or any of these things that i've been exposed to ever since i've been watching else
[3:39:11.560 --> 3:39:16.440]  jones's show ever since he got censored i started watching him and now i'm exposed to all the stuff
[3:39:16.440 --> 3:39:23.560]  of nightmares like agenda 21 and when you look at it how the un wants to district the populations
[3:39:23.560 --> 3:39:28.600]  the easiest way to do that is when you have the populations themselves district themselves
[3:39:29.160 --> 3:39:33.960]  because we outnumber them we outgun them we outlive them we out everything them
[3:39:33.960 --> 3:39:38.760]  um so we have to do it to ourselves so what you do is you say hey get that burrito out of your
[3:39:38.760 --> 3:39:42.680]  mouth you're not a mexican and someone's like well i'm half mexican it's like well then you're
[3:39:42.680 --> 3:39:48.600]  half wrong that's nonsense i remember when i used to live in california there was a a walk
[3:39:48.600 --> 3:39:53.720]  for skin cancer i remember one of my my friends who was from an extremely wealthy family but
[3:39:53.720 --> 3:40:00.120]  had joined black lives matter even though he's white and jewish and rich he uh he was like i'm
[3:40:00.120 --> 3:40:07.160]  gonna do a a walk for skin cancer my first reaction was outdoors because i didn't know if he realized
[3:40:07.160 --> 3:40:12.120]  that we lived in a very high uv area uh los angeles you don't want to do a skin cancer walk
[3:40:12.120 --> 3:40:22.120]  outside that doesn't make any sense that's like smoking for lung cancer um anyway so i was wearing
[3:40:22.120 --> 3:40:26.040]  a sombrero this is why i wrote this joke this happened to me three years ago because that was
[3:40:26.040 --> 3:40:30.920]  the second the second year i did that joke i was at the improv wearing a sombrero and me and my
[3:40:30.920 --> 3:40:36.120]  buddy were jose and jose b and the same guy came up to me and was like you can't wear a sombrero
[3:40:37.320 --> 3:40:41.400]  and i'm like why and he's like because that's not your hat now because at first i was like you can
[3:40:41.400 --> 3:40:46.680]  be the third god you can be uh one direction because we're going to be three dudes in sombreros
[3:40:46.680 --> 3:40:51.800]  one direction or jose jose b of course all the mexican bus boys and stuff that i was boys with
[3:40:51.800 --> 3:40:57.080]  thought it was hilarious because the people that are actually offended are always they're almost
[3:40:57.080 --> 3:41:04.520]  always white women from wealthy families or female acting males that are white it's always that i mean
[3:41:04.520 --> 3:41:09.400]  i've never met anyone else except for maybe kyle and cabernic but i've never met him i feel like
[3:41:09.400 --> 3:41:15.880]  he may be at this point digital but anyway so i started thinking about it if anyone needs a sombrero
[3:41:15.880 --> 3:41:23.800]  it's the whites because i was looking at this guy i'm like the sun is beating down on our white skin
[3:41:23.800 --> 3:41:28.040]  and we need a giant brim and this is how this is why i believe that god has a sense of humor because
[3:41:28.040 --> 3:41:33.560]  the whitest people on the planet pasty very white people traditionally white people have the smallest
[3:41:33.560 --> 3:41:38.600]  hats and of course i'm referring to the jews the jews have a tiny little hat called a yamaka
[3:41:38.600 --> 3:41:43.160]  and it doesn't have a brim at all it looks like a swim cap for a kitten and so they have no sun
[3:41:43.160 --> 3:41:47.960]  protection but yet the these hispanic people with these beautiful brown resilient skin to the sun of
[3:41:47.960 --> 3:41:56.600]  these giant uh brim so my proposal is for mexicans and jews to switch hats and that's how we actually
[3:41:56.600 --> 3:42:04.200]  cure skin cancer not his little walk in the park in the sun and see that's actual problem solving
[3:42:04.200 --> 3:42:09.080]  you know if anyone needs a sombrero it's it's the whites and if anyone needs a larger hat it's the
[3:42:09.080 --> 3:42:14.680]  jews and so i believe that that is how we actually start solving some problems oh hey love my beautiful
[3:42:14.680 --> 3:42:19.880]  wife just uh brought me some coffee thank you very much she's actually half half mexican so she gets
[3:42:19.880 --> 3:42:25.080]  to wear half of sombrero it looks kind of absurd like half of sombrero oh is that the is that the
[3:42:25.080 --> 3:42:31.400]  music well i'll be back for another um another thing here but uh huge pianist dot com for uh tickets
[3:42:31.400 --> 3:42:36.760]  to my tour or my last four specials that we produced ourselves to get away from the um the

[3:49:00.040 --> 3:49:07.240]  you know they're doing lines of like yeah they're doing lines of like gluten free cocaine like
[3:49:08.200 --> 3:49:16.520]  like is this gluten free don't use a straw don't use a straw straws are bad straws are bad straws are
[3:49:16.520 --> 3:49:24.280]  bad they're just their minds are gone they're like donald trump is literally hitler now it's time to
[3:49:24.280 --> 3:49:31.800]  give all your guns to hitler i'm like one time i was having watched with my friend this girl and
[3:49:31.800 --> 3:49:36.040]  she was like would you kill hitler as a baby if you could but do you think you could do that for
[3:49:36.040 --> 3:49:40.920]  the world like if you were a time traveler and you saw hitler in a crib could you kill hitler
[3:49:40.920 --> 3:49:45.640]  i'm like why do you ask it's like i don't know if i could do it i know i i should but i don't know
[3:49:45.640 --> 3:49:52.200]  if i could do it i'm like you could do it she's like what uh no no i'm like a kind person i remember
[3:49:52.200 --> 3:49:56.600]  pita i'm like well you've had you've had two abortions that weren't hitler
[3:50:03.320 --> 3:50:10.520]  so like the odds they were hitler is like zero and you just pulled the plug because you didn't
[3:50:10.520 --> 3:50:18.120]  want to cancel your netflix account yeah so if you want a comedy like that come my way because a
[3:50:18.120 --> 3:50:24.120]  joke like that doesn't end up on netflix uh susan rice who used to work for the obama administration
[3:50:24.120 --> 3:50:28.600]  is now uh one of the board members of netflix netflix has become a propaganda wing for the
[3:50:28.600 --> 3:50:34.840]  democratic party and that's not conspiratorial it's a fact just with the with the exception of a few
[3:50:34.840 --> 3:50:41.160]  specials that have made it through you know like norm mcdonald's hitler's dog is hysterical uh the 2006
[3:50:41.160 --> 3:50:45.960]  rogan specials really funny there's a few funny specials on there bill burress and funny ones
[3:50:46.520 --> 3:50:51.560]  but in general it's all left as propaganda you can't make fun of islam you can't make fun of
[3:50:51.560 --> 3:50:57.960]  abortions you can't make fun of uh anything like that it all has to be you know orange man bad
[3:50:57.960 --> 3:51:03.320]  lemon man good don lemon and uh so it's a it's a battle of the citrus at this point
[3:51:03.320 --> 3:51:10.920]  orange man bad lemon man good what's citrus are you on uh and the hypocrisy of the left
[3:51:10.920 --> 3:51:16.600]  is more troubling than i think a lot of people want to understand because if you accept the
[3:51:16.600 --> 3:51:21.960]  hypocrisy what you did is you just created a priest class so when you have people doing lines of
[3:51:21.960 --> 3:51:33.480]  cocaine uh you know and not and and not being able to use a straw because they think that and don't
[3:51:33.480 --> 3:51:38.120]  get me wrong i'm not for the drug laws that we currently have as i'm i'm assessing what i'm saying
[3:51:38.120 --> 3:51:42.920]  in my mind with the moral equivalency i'm not saying that just the existence of cocaine itself is
[3:51:42.920 --> 3:51:49.080]  immoral because i personally think that uh that the the drug war is is a is a nonsense war at this
[3:51:49.080 --> 3:51:54.680]  point but just hear me out that the straw they're using they want banned because they think it'll
[3:51:54.680 --> 3:52:05.240]  help see life like that's so crazy you know and then pita is more offended if you eat an egg
[3:52:05.240 --> 3:52:10.440]  that's been fertilized by rooster and i have roosters and chickens and i've cut the heads
[3:52:10.440 --> 3:52:16.600]  off for roosters they're really not good they're not good dudes you know after the Kavanaugh thing
[3:52:16.600 --> 3:52:22.200]  i've been less likely to kill roosters because i'm trying to stand with the boys but um what
[3:52:22.200 --> 3:52:27.560]  am i talking about all right anyway so they're more they're offended by that but not someone's
[3:52:27.560 --> 3:52:35.800]  like third abortion at 20 weeks that's complete madness and so to point that out we'll get this
[3:52:35.800 --> 3:52:41.400]  this relief laugh from the crowd the crowd's like because they want to hear it so bad because they
[3:52:41.400 --> 3:52:46.520]  know that hypocrisy is literally rotting them from the inside out and the comedian's job is to
[3:52:46.520 --> 3:52:55.480]  point out the hypocrisy and let people heal and then if somehow the uh the scales moved and they're
[3:52:55.480 --> 3:53:01.320]  they're ended up being an overly conservative environment that the comedian's job would be
[3:53:01.320 --> 3:53:06.680]  more like uh george carlin or lennie bruce to point out some of the problems of the overly
[3:53:06.680 --> 3:53:11.880]  conservative world and that's kind of the function of the comedian and right now we are drowning in
[3:53:11.880 --> 3:53:17.640]  leftism and progressivism and political correctness and these non-player characters just reciting
[3:53:17.640 --> 3:53:23.480]  whatever they're told and so the comedian has to point that out and we're seeing it all falling
[3:53:23.480 --> 3:53:27.880]  and failing we turn on saturday night live for relief from the Kavanaugh hearing and we see them
[3:53:28.520 --> 3:53:35.400]  brutalizing Kavanaugh and not making fun of the obvious nonsense of christine blossom ford a person
[3:53:35.400 --> 3:53:41.800]  who since then has disappeared you know someone who is so you know adamant about justice and truth
[3:53:41.800 --> 3:53:51.640]  and and after 37 years i'm finally ready to face face my and then as soon as uh they weren't allowed
[3:53:51.640 --> 3:53:56.280]  in as soon as kavanaugh didn't get in she was like all right i'm out of 5 30 i'll see you later i'm
[3:53:56.280 --> 3:54:03.960]  just going to grab this 900k in my book deal and go home um she's a liar what she was saying is total
[3:54:03.960 --> 3:54:09.160]  total nonsense and some people are like yeah but we don't know if she was lying yeah we do she was
[3:54:09.160 --> 3:54:17.160]  lying uh i have a hard time remembering a month ago in detail let alone uh lies from from longer
[3:54:18.040 --> 3:54:24.680]  that memory was older than my existence and people are like we must listen so we turn on s and l
[3:54:24.680 --> 3:54:30.920]  to get the relief to make fun of christine blossom ford's little kid voice or how all these people
[3:54:30.920 --> 3:54:37.720]  that defended ted kennedy who literally raped a chick on the floor of a of a restaurant and also
[3:54:37.720 --> 3:54:44.280]  killed another one uh who's called the lion of the senate lion not lying like what he would be called
[3:54:44.280 --> 3:54:53.480]  lion this red-faced murderer and um sodomite so we're supposed to forget all that and with a
[3:54:53.480 --> 3:55:02.760]  straight face look at these pit this den of snakes telling us like we're be be strong christine blossom
[3:55:02.760 --> 3:55:11.400]  ford we know we know that you're in pain and did did he touch your mouth and yell loudly and then
[3:55:11.400 --> 3:55:18.040]  you had to get home before uber from a place that you don't remember peace and and and we're just at
[3:55:18.040 --> 3:55:23.960]  home like okay if no one releases the tension of this we're gonna rot from the inside out as a society
[3:55:23.960 --> 3:55:30.360]  so we turn on s and l we watch matt daemon that coward who knows better the people i hate the most
[3:55:30.360 --> 3:55:34.360]  are the ones that know better that's why i had this like chip on my shoulder about joe rogan
[3:55:34.360 --> 3:55:39.480]  and a couple other these people it's not because they're not doing similar things that that others
[3:55:39.480 --> 3:55:45.960]  do it's that i know they know better rogan knows a lot of stuff like he's a smart dude and a strong
[3:55:45.960 --> 3:55:52.120]  dude so to see him take the knee is so much worse than just like these morons and matt daemon
[3:55:52.680 --> 3:55:56.840]  who raped me by the way oh do you guys want to play that clip do you have the clip of the
[3:55:56.840 --> 3:56:02.040]  matt of the confession of matt daemon's rape do we have matt daemon rape clip from my account i
[3:56:02.040 --> 3:56:06.280]  think we have just enough time where i can sum it up and show it well matt daemon
[3:56:07.320 --> 3:56:13.000]  matt daemon rape me all right if we don't play the clip then that will that will that
[3:56:13.000 --> 3:56:18.760]  that'll make no real sense because um i mean he didn't really rape me i was trying to make a point
[3:56:18.760 --> 3:56:24.440]  that that you can just say anyone raped anyone uh oh here it is you got the audio on that
[3:56:27.000 --> 3:56:32.840]  okay so go check check that out it's on my youtube account i was just trying to make make these people
[3:56:32.840 --> 3:56:39.720]  play by their own rules um so there was no relief from serenade live and as we just saw in the news
[3:56:39.720 --> 3:56:44.600]  yesterday bill marr has just been accused of calling an ex-girlfriend the n word and trying
[3:56:44.600 --> 3:56:49.720]  to hit her in the head with a hammer so if we're going to go with believe all women hashtag then
[3:56:49.720 --> 3:56:57.480]  bill marr should be in prison uh with no trial so bill marr who says believe all women koko
[3:56:57.480 --> 3:57:02.360]  johnson i think her name was just said that bill marr called her all these racial pejoratives and
[3:57:02.360 --> 3:57:09.320]  threatened it beat her in the head with a hammer um so i think that he should have due process and
[3:57:09.320 --> 3:57:15.560]  and you know be able to face his accuser and stuff but according to him he shouldn't so bill marr
[3:57:15.560 --> 3:57:20.920]  should be in prison for beating koko in the head with a hammer all right so what i'm trying to
[3:57:20.920 --> 3:57:28.520]  say is comedy is necessary to point out to kind of stress test society and allow us to have some
[3:57:28.520 --> 3:57:36.120]  sort of uh relief from the liars and the pigs and uh you know huge pianist dot com if you want a
