[00:00.000 --> 00:10.000]  Big Brother, mainstream media, government cover-ups.
[00:10.000 --> 00:11.000]  You want answers?
[00:11.000 --> 00:13.000]  Well, so does he.
[00:13.000 --> 00:40.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:40.000 --> 00:44.000]  Friends, here we are live, broadcasting worldwide.
[00:44.000 --> 00:51.000]  It is already Tuesday, the 29th day of April, 2014.
[00:51.000 --> 01:00.000]  We have a professor of behavioral psychology joining us to give us her take on the larger study of epigenetics,
[01:00.000 --> 01:02.000]  because I saw her give an interesting interview on it,
[01:02.000 --> 01:08.000]  and she's one of the first people we're going to interview on the subject of instincts.
[01:08.000 --> 01:11.000]  Understanding our instincts and what they really are,
[01:11.000 --> 01:14.000]  and how they're being programmed by the establishment,
[01:14.000 --> 01:17.000]  is absolutely key to becoming truly free.
[01:17.000 --> 01:23.000]  And the discussion of, are we just biological robots, or do we have free will?
[01:23.000 --> 01:26.000]  Well, it clearly shows we have more than free will.
[01:26.000 --> 01:32.000]  We have the will of our ancestors, and more than just basic instincts in us.
[01:32.000 --> 01:43.000]  And we really have ingrained in us the knowledge and the triumphs and the tribulations of our ancestors.
[01:43.000 --> 01:47.000]  I'm going to spend about 30, 40 minutes with her at the start of the next hour.
[01:47.000 --> 01:49.000]  Then he's always informative.
[01:49.000 --> 01:51.000]  He's got a bunch of breaking news he's going to have with us.
[01:51.000 --> 01:55.000]  Dr. Edward Grubs is going to be in studio with us.
[01:55.000 --> 02:00.000]  Obviously, we're going to cover the latest developments in Ukraine,
[02:00.000 --> 02:06.000]  and then tie it in to what's happening here domestically with political correctness,
[02:06.000 --> 02:17.000]  where if one old rich guy, welfare queen, who gets his sports stadiums built by LA taxpayers,
[02:17.000 --> 02:21.000]  some old billionaire says some racist stuff,
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.000]  we're all supposed to continue to have some national discussion about it,
[02:24.000 --> 02:29.000]  and then look for ways to prove we're not racist or bad.
[02:29.000 --> 02:35.000]  And then every major minority group out there is allowed to spew whatever anti-white garbage they want 24-7.
[02:35.000 --> 02:39.000]  That's what this whole atmosphere is about, is balkanization.
[02:39.000 --> 02:41.000]  I'm going to break that down coming up today.
[02:41.000 --> 02:44.000]  That's the racial politics of the Democratic Party.
[02:44.000 --> 02:54.000]  We talked about it with Joseph Ferrisom yesterday, but Dartmouth has banned the word fiesta from fiesta parties,
[02:54.000 --> 03:04.000]  because there's not enough Mexicans, that's a quote, that are going to be attending the party.
[03:04.000 --> 03:08.000]  Imagine you say we're going to have a fiesta-style party tonight.
[03:08.000 --> 03:12.000]  I've probably been to 25, 30 fiesta parties in my life, and people say,
[03:12.000 --> 03:15.000]  hey, come over, we're going to have a fiesta.
[03:15.000 --> 03:17.000]  And then you go over and drink margaritas and eat Mexican food,
[03:17.000 --> 03:20.000]  and it has nothing to do with putting down Mexicans.
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  It'd be like saying we're going to have a toga party in college.
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  I mean, is that something against the Greeks?
[03:25.000 --> 03:28.000]  I mean, I just, this is ridiculous.
[03:28.000 --> 03:29.000]  This is ridiculous.
[03:29.000 --> 03:35.000]  I saw those Colorado colleges this year that were last year saying,
[03:35.000 --> 03:40.000]  Halloween, don't come as a cowboy or a Native American, don't come as a geisha girl.
[03:40.000 --> 03:41.000]  What?
[03:41.000 --> 03:42.000]  What?
[03:42.000 --> 03:45.000]  I mean, imagine going to a costume shop for Halloween and going,
[03:45.000 --> 03:50.000]  oh, I better not be a cowboy, that's racist, or I better not be a samurai, that's racist.
[03:50.000 --> 03:53.000]  They're now teaching that, well, I've told the story.
[03:53.000 --> 03:58.000]  I was at Martin Springs last year, and there were two Hispanic guys and a white guy,
[03:58.000 --> 03:59.000]  and they're all swimming.
[03:59.000 --> 04:00.000]  They were obviously stoned out of their mind.
[04:00.000 --> 04:02.000]  You could tell they'd been smoking pot.
[04:02.000 --> 04:03.000]  They were laughing, giggling.
[04:03.000 --> 04:06.000]  And the guy goes, man, I'm really hungry.
[04:06.000 --> 04:07.000]  Let's go.
[04:07.000 --> 04:10.000]  Let's split and go get Chinese food.
[04:10.000 --> 04:14.000]  And one Hispanic and white guy said to the other Hispanic guy,
[04:14.000 --> 04:18.000]  they go, shh, that's racist, man.
[04:18.000 --> 04:21.000]  Just the words are now racist.
[04:21.000 --> 04:23.000]  Fiesta just means party in Spanish.
[04:23.000 --> 04:25.000]  I have to tell folks that.
[04:25.000 --> 04:28.000]  What if somebody says in English, let's have a party?
[04:28.000 --> 04:31.000]  Are you going to say, I mean, Fiesta, Texas, are you going to ban that park?
[04:31.000 --> 04:34.000]  I mean, it just means the party place.
[04:34.000 --> 04:36.000]  Is Fiesta still good, Alex?
[04:36.000 --> 04:37.000]  I don't know.
[04:37.000 --> 04:38.000]  I took a Fiesta this weekend for an hour.
[04:38.000 --> 04:39.000]  Oh, boy.
[04:39.000 --> 04:40.000]  I did it because I was racist.
[04:40.000 --> 04:45.000]  I actually said, we were down at the pool with some of my buddies,
[04:45.000 --> 04:49.000]  and I said, hey, I'm going to go take a Fiesta.
[04:49.000 --> 04:50.000]  You know why I did that?
[04:50.000 --> 04:53.000]  Not because I live in Texas and have adopted a lot of Spanish words.
[04:53.000 --> 04:56.000]  It was because it was a racist code word.
[04:56.000 --> 05:22.000]  And I need to go to reeducation training.
[05:22.000 --> 05:33.000]  It is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media.
[05:33.000 --> 05:35.000]  We are the true media.
[05:35.000 --> 05:38.000]  The establishment dinosaur press is dying.
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.000]  We are in an information war, and we are losing that war.

[05:57.000 --> 06:01.000]  Join us at prisonplanet.tv.
[06:01.000 --> 06:05.000]  The globalist social engineers are not just targeting us with propaganda.
[06:05.000 --> 06:07.000]  They are manipulating our genetics.
[06:07.000 --> 06:12.000]  We are being targeted at every level by estrogen mimicers that lower our testosterone
[06:12.000 --> 06:15.000]  and other hormones and natural compounds that the body needs.
[06:15.000 --> 06:18.000]  After consulting top doctors, nutritionists, pharmacists and others,
[06:18.000 --> 06:25.000]  we have developed what I believe is the ultimate non-GMO organic super male vitality formula
[06:25.000 --> 06:31.000]  sourced from powerful organic herbs and then concentrated for maximum potency.
[06:31.000 --> 06:39.000]  Super male vitality was developed to activate your body's own natural processes instead of using synthetic chemicals.
[06:39.000 --> 06:45.000]  Super male vitality by info wars life is so powerful that I only take half the recommended dose.
[06:45.000 --> 06:52.000]  For a limited time, we are offering 15% off super male vitality at infowarslife.com

[07:00.000 --> 07:05.000]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[07:05.000 --> 07:09.000]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminate.
[07:09.000 --> 07:13.000]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[07:13.000 --> 07:16.000]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[07:16.000 --> 07:21.000]  My friends, water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family
[07:21.000 --> 07:24.000]  from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[07:24.000 --> 07:27.000]  On average the county says it sprays with glyphosate at least once a week.
[07:27.000 --> 07:32.000]  Few filters cut out the glyphosate that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[07:32.000 --> 07:38.000]  Move pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[07:38.000 --> 07:42.000]  Fluoride is in teats and coffins and water and breads and toothpaste.
[07:42.000 --> 07:46.000]  It is our responsibility to protect our families. The establishment is not going to do it.
[07:46.000 --> 07:49.000]  It's time to take action. It's time to filter our water.

[08:22.000 --> 08:26.000]  Waging war on corruption, crashing to the lies and disinformation.
[08:26.000 --> 08:33.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this Tuesday Worldwide Edition.
[08:33.000 --> 08:38.000]  Really for me the top story of everything that's happening out there and all the different diversions
[08:38.000 --> 08:42.000]  like the Clippers, Racist Owner and the Missing Malaysian Aircraft
[08:42.000 --> 08:49.000]  is White House wants Chinese style ID system for Internet users.
[08:49.000 --> 08:57.000]  The national strategy for trusted identities in cyberspace is the Chinese style net ID to track, tax
[08:57.000 --> 09:02.000]  and also ban anyone who, quote, gets three strikes doing something wrong on the Internet,
[09:02.000 --> 09:04.000]  quote, downloading illegal music, you name it.
[09:04.000 --> 09:12.000]  There'll be no proof. It's just the web bots will claim that you have got three strikes and you're out
[09:12.000 --> 09:15.000]  like being banned from YouTube.
[09:15.000 --> 09:20.000]  This is the strategy already used all over the world, places like Communist China
[09:20.000 --> 09:23.000]  and now they are moving forward to do it here.
[09:23.000 --> 09:28.000]  This is a big deal. The story is up on infowars.com.
[09:28.000 --> 09:35.000]  Testing is set to begin next month on a pilot program that will lead to the introduction of a Chinese style ID system
[09:35.000 --> 09:38.000]  for Internet users, an identity ecosystem.
[09:38.000 --> 09:43.000]  See, as long as it's an ecosystem, it's okay. That sounds like it's good for the environment.
[09:43.000 --> 09:47.000]  And of course, all the new Microsoft operating systems the last five years,
[09:47.000 --> 09:53.000]  all their new systems have Internet ID thumbprint biometrics built into them.
[09:53.000 --> 09:59.000]  So they're already standardizing and rolling out that you thumbprint for your iPhone to work.
[09:59.000 --> 10:07.000]  Right now it's something that you can choose to do or not to do, but in the future, you will do it.
[10:07.000 --> 10:11.000]  This is how they're going to, quote, fix all the Internet fraud and all the commerce fraud.
[10:11.000 --> 10:17.000]  That's why the NSA released the codes for the encryption of financial transactions.
[10:17.000 --> 10:19.000]  And now it's come out. They're the ones that were behind it.
[10:19.000 --> 10:24.000]  And that the FBI has hackers write most of the big bugs to infect the Internet
[10:24.000 --> 10:29.000]  because they are the ones running the backdoor systems into your computers.
[10:29.000 --> 10:33.000]  But to have plausible deniability, they release it themselves.
[10:33.000 --> 10:39.000]  The White House's national security strategy for trusted Internet identities in cyberspace.
[10:39.000 --> 10:43.000]  Again, the national strategy for trusted Internet identities in cyberspace
[10:43.000 --> 10:48.000]  would replace the current system of using passwords to access sensitive online accounts
[10:48.000 --> 10:55.000]  with something akin to a biometric ID card that would link one's individual to all their government services
[10:55.000 --> 11:03.000]  such as food stamps, welfare and all other myriad of things like mortgage applications and applications for licenses.
[11:03.000 --> 11:08.000]  I'm going to stop right there. The story is up on infowars.com with video.
[11:08.000 --> 11:14.000]  But remember that ICE is just releasing the illegals, not doing deportations.
[11:14.000 --> 11:20.000]  Remember the big banks bragged in Wall Street Journal years ago.
[11:20.000 --> 11:28.000]  We've covered the article just a few weeks ago again that they let illegals with no IDs get housing loans, but citizens can.
[11:28.000 --> 11:33.000]  I'm not harping on the illegals. The point is the globalists want the illegals here,
[11:33.000 --> 11:37.000]  so they subsidize it and don't enforce the law on them.
[11:37.000 --> 11:48.000]  But it's just like the Clippers owner gets his sports stadium paid for for $400 million by taxpayers or Jerry Jones, 1.2 billion.
[11:48.000 --> 11:57.000]  That's how this works, ladies and gentlemen. That's how these systems operate.
[11:57.000 --> 12:05.000]  Just like General Electric and Google don't pay any taxes and they're allowed to run factories with forced abortions,
[12:05.000 --> 12:14.000]  forced sterilization, forced drugging and suicide nets, something beyond THX 113A.
[12:14.000 --> 12:22.000]  Shaved heads, coffin dormitories. By the way, I've got to send my reporters out.
[12:22.000 --> 12:29.000]  They're taking the old Holly Street Ark Deco classical power plant in downtown Austin on Lake Austin
[12:29.000 --> 12:35.000]  and are turning it into 200 square foot coffin apartments that they're putting in San Francisco,
[12:35.000 --> 12:43.000]  that they're putting in places like New York where they can charge you higher rents,
[12:43.000 --> 12:50.000]  get higher property taxes and take more of what you make and get you used to living in a 200.
[12:50.000 --> 12:53.000]  I was reading that in the paper last week, I meant to cover it here.
[12:53.000 --> 13:03.000]  They're talking about putting upwards, get ready for this, ladies and gentlemen, of a thousand rooms in.
[13:03.000 --> 13:08.000]  In a building that's not that big and it's basically a prison.
[13:08.000 --> 13:12.000]  They admit, well, it's going to be low income people in the richest area of Austin,
[13:12.000 --> 13:16.000]  so we'll have extra police and security and security getting out.
[13:16.000 --> 13:26.000]  They're going to stick all the workers for the rich people downtown in literal coffin boxes and rip them off for the prices.
[13:26.000 --> 13:30.000]  And it's all subsidized in a private company set to make the money.
[13:30.000 --> 13:35.000]  I mean, what a filthy corrupt degenerate evil city council.
[13:35.000 --> 13:37.000]  I was talking about my buddy's list downtown.
[13:37.000 --> 13:43.000]  He basically saw the shooting off his balcony at two o'clock in the morning this weekend.
[13:43.000 --> 13:50.000]  And because it happened down on Second Street, right by the W, they didn't want anybody to know that.
[13:50.000 --> 13:59.000]  So they announced the next day on the news that the double shooting happened at 11th Street and 35 over in what was formerly the ghetto.
[13:59.000 --> 14:00.000]  No, it didn't.
[14:00.000 --> 14:09.000]  It happened right in front, right beside the city hall and the W, two people gunned down.
[14:09.000 --> 14:16.000]  My buddy hears all this screaming, goes look out his window and literally hears the gunshots and the women and people screaming.
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.000]  And it copped speed down and he said over 100 miles an hour down Congress,
[14:20.000 --> 14:23.000]  weaving between cars, pulling up, running around in the woods, whoever did it got away.
[14:23.000 --> 14:24.000]  It doesn't matter.
[14:24.000 --> 14:27.000]  They'll just tell Austin it happened at East 11th.
[14:27.000 --> 14:34.000]  Hell, why not tell them it happened in North Korea or Chicago, huh?
[14:34.000 --> 14:42.000]  Now I'm just digressing off into the total deception.
[14:42.000 --> 14:44.000]  Oh, now they've moved it to 12th Street and 15th.
[14:44.000 --> 14:45.000]  Good.
[14:45.000 --> 14:47.000]  Why don't they move it north to Waco?
[14:47.000 --> 14:50.000]  Did you hear that double shooting downtown this weekend?
[14:50.000 --> 14:51.000]  It happened in Waco.
[14:51.000 --> 14:53.000]  Waco, Austin.
[14:53.000 --> 14:56.000]  Or, no, no, no, Dallas.
[14:56.000 --> 14:59.000]  The shooting in downtown Austin happened in Dallas.
[14:59.000 --> 15:03.000]  Oh, what a country.
[15:03.000 --> 15:05.000]  What a country.
[15:05.000 --> 15:15.000]  Or the only way that police aren't lying is that there was another shooting.
[15:15.000 --> 15:21.000]  But see, now they're going to build right by that, right by the city hall.
[15:21.000 --> 15:30.000]  They're going to build a giant coffin facility so they can charge people maximum amounts for the least amount because that's the trendy thing to do.
[15:30.000 --> 15:34.000]  That's the cool thing to do.
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.000]  I was picking my children up at a camp, an exercise camp, dance camp.
[15:39.000 --> 15:47.000]  And I sat there listening to two women a few weeks ago talk about how great dumpster diving is.
[15:47.000 --> 15:48.000]  It's the new thing.
[15:48.000 --> 15:53.000]  And for the environment, how they're going to start dumpster diving and taking their children in.
[15:53.000 --> 15:59.000]  And they're just into being poor, into having nothing, into paying everything in taxes.
[15:59.000 --> 16:02.000]  They are into embracing the green police, all of it.
[16:02.000 --> 16:05.000]  Nothing has anything to do with green police.
[16:05.000 --> 16:10.000]  But how did I even get into this train of thought?
[16:10.000 --> 16:13.000]  Because there's so much to cover, so much to go over.
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.000]  Oh, yes, the internet plantation.
[16:17.000 --> 16:20.000]  White House wants a Chinese-style ID system for internet users.
[16:20.000 --> 16:31.000]  Then I was talking about how the Foxcom workers actually live in coffin-sized tubes you get in that they then inject you into the wall.
[16:31.000 --> 16:36.000]  In Japan, they have TVs and other stuff that are a little bit nicer and claustrophobic.
[16:36.000 --> 16:41.000]  But this is now going to come here.
[16:41.000 --> 16:44.000]  Pretty soon it will be, oh, you live in a 200 square foot?
[16:44.000 --> 16:48.000]  My gosh, I live in a 20 square foot.
[16:48.000 --> 16:50.000]  They'll be like, that's nothing.
[16:50.000 --> 16:52.000]  Why, my girlfriend, she's really rich.
[16:52.000 --> 16:55.000]  She lives in a 100 square foot jail cell.
[16:55.000 --> 16:58.000]  And you'll go through police checkpoints and biometric IDs.
[16:58.000 --> 17:00.000]  And this is the new smart city.
[17:00.000 --> 17:07.000]  So the big rent seekers, they can live up above you in their 5,000 square foot penthouses.
[17:07.000 --> 17:12.000]  And then you will live down in a coffin and you will thank them for it.
[17:12.000 --> 17:17.000]  And then if you ever say anything bad about Big Brother online, you won't just be kicked off like they do on Facebook.
[17:17.000 --> 17:19.000]  Have you exposed Benghazi?
[17:19.000 --> 17:21.000]  Have you exposed Shalindra Gate?
[17:21.000 --> 17:22.000]  Have you exposed NSA?
[17:22.000 --> 17:24.000]  Or have you a pro-second amendment site?
[17:24.000 --> 17:29.000]  They kick you off on record because Zuckerberg calls you dumb-effors.
[17:29.000 --> 17:31.000]  No, you'll be kicked off the internet, period.
[17:31.000 --> 17:34.000]  No judge, no jury, three strikes you're out.
[17:34.000 --> 17:37.000]  That's the official internet to global treaty that got leaked.
[17:37.000 --> 17:38.000]  That's the plan.
[17:38.000 --> 17:39.000]  They're going to try to do it.
[17:39.000 --> 17:41.000]  What's their answer to the dinosaur media dying?
[17:41.000 --> 17:45.000]  What's their answer to the rise of infowars.com?
[17:45.000 --> 17:48.000]  What's their answer to Congress having the lowest approval rating in history?
[17:48.000 --> 17:54.000]  6% poll, young people, historic low level of trust in government?
[17:54.000 --> 17:57.000]  That's the story out of Business Insider.
[17:57.000 --> 18:01.000]  What's their answer going to be?
[18:01.000 --> 18:09.000]  Their answer, ladies and gentlemen, is going to be to try to shut us up and shut us down.
[18:09.000 --> 18:13.000]  That's simple.
[18:13.000 --> 18:15.000]  That's their answer.
[18:15.000 --> 18:23.000]  That's where they're going with all this.
[18:23.000 --> 18:25.000]  Well, they're obviously extremists.
[18:25.000 --> 18:29.000]  Obviously, the millennials will start trusting the government again if we just shut off their internet freedom
[18:29.000 --> 18:32.000]  and only let them visit CNN and MSNBC.
[18:32.000 --> 18:34.000]  That'll get the ratings back up, right?
[18:34.000 --> 18:38.000]  Or they can watch Entertainment, Jimmy Kimmel, or any other comedy show
[18:38.000 --> 18:43.000]  on there every week, or ESPN and C.O. Obama on there every week.
[18:43.000 --> 18:46.000]  This is what they're setting up, ladies and gentlemen.
[18:46.000 --> 18:51.000]  Eclectocracy, where the entire social system, the government,
[18:51.000 --> 18:55.000]  social engineering is designed around protecting the ruling class,
[18:55.000 --> 19:01.000]  living a more wealthy and rich, over-the-top, conspicuous consumption lifestyle.
[19:01.000 --> 19:07.000]  While you live in coffin boxes, paying 90% of what you earned to the ultra-rich
[19:07.000 --> 19:09.000]  through corporate welfare and subsidies,
[19:09.000 --> 19:13.000]  while they lecture you on how you need to pay more taxes,
[19:13.000 --> 19:16.000]  the ultimate form of discrimination,
[19:16.000 --> 19:19.000]  and that's why they bring in the Sterling story and the Clippers,
[19:19.000 --> 19:24.000]  and now they all have an all-black league with nothing but black coaches and black folks.
[19:24.000 --> 19:25.000]  Well, that's where it's going anyways.
[19:25.000 --> 19:29.000]  Fine, I don't care.
[19:29.000 --> 19:31.000]  Imagine you try to have an all-white league again.
[19:31.000 --> 19:33.000]  See, everything flips in the end,
[19:33.000 --> 19:35.000]  and then an all-black league won't be racist.
[19:35.000 --> 19:37.000]  Being white in and of itself will be evil,
[19:37.000 --> 19:42.000]  all because we can point at some big, fat, rich guy whose tax exempt
[19:42.000 --> 19:44.000]  and gets everything paid for for him,
[19:44.000 --> 19:49.000]  all because he sits there making weird statements because he hates his players.
[19:49.000 --> 19:53.000]  I have to do whatever the government says and accept Obamacare
[19:53.000 --> 19:55.000]  and turn my guns and I'm a racist.
[19:55.000 --> 19:57.000]  Well, you know what? I reject your political correctness.
[19:57.000 --> 20:00.000]  They say you can't even say the word fiesta now.

[21:59.000 --> 22:03.000]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply in nine West Virginia counties.
[22:03.000 --> 22:07.000]  This year alone over 300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminated.
[22:07.000 --> 22:11.000]  What are the health effects of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[22:11.000 --> 22:14.000]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents.
[22:14.000 --> 22:19.000]  My friend's water filtration is one of the most basic actions you can take to protect you and your family
[22:19.000 --> 22:21.000]  from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[22:21.000 --> 22:25.000]  On average the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week.
[22:25.000 --> 22:29.000]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[22:29.000 --> 22:35.000]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[22:35.000 --> 22:39.000]  Fluoride is intense in coffee and water and breads and toothpaste.
[22:39.000 --> 22:43.000]  It is our responsibility to protect our families. The establishment's not going to do it.
[22:43.000 --> 22:46.000]  It's time to take action. It's time to filter our water.

[24:22.000 --> 24:35.000]  So, ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here back live. Where have we gotten to in this society?
[24:35.000 --> 24:41.000]  We don't care if the ultra-rich are basically tax-exempt and mainly make their money off of government welfare,
[24:41.000 --> 24:47.000]  corporate welfare, and government contracts. While those very ultra-rich, Warren Buffett and others,
[24:47.000 --> 24:53.000]  lobby to destroy the middle class and any new wealth who is not basically tax-exempt like they are.
[24:53.000 --> 25:01.000]  How do they keep a population at each other's throats? How do they keep a population unaware of how they're being collectively robbed
[25:01.000 --> 25:07.000]  as they design the society to raise taxes and energy prices to the point of making you poor
[25:07.000 --> 25:13.000]  unless you're part of the ruling class who has special rules and exemptions?
[25:13.000 --> 25:21.000]  How do you balkanize the public so they don't unify around the fact that Obamacare was written by foreign bank-owned insurance companies
[25:21.000 --> 25:29.000]  to double and triple your prices and lower the quality of care and set up death panels and social engineer?
[25:29.000 --> 25:37.000]  You take every racial insensitive comment, you blow it out of proportion, you make people feel inadequate,
[25:37.000 --> 25:47.000]  and you collectively act like what the clipper's owner says is projected onto every white person in America.
[25:47.000 --> 25:53.000]  And you have Spike Lee come out and say, the white players need to speak out.
[25:53.000 --> 26:03.000]  And you have famous basketball players, and I've got it here in my stack, come out and say, let's have an all-black league.
[26:03.000 --> 26:09.000]  I thought the old white leagues were racist. Fine, have it.
[26:09.000 --> 26:18.000]  My whole issue is that's where all this is going, is actually making everyone racist and everyone racially obsessed,
[26:18.000 --> 26:23.000]  but the new systems won't be called racism.
[26:23.000 --> 26:33.000]  Democrats are organizing their, quote, minority groups into tribal groups, making sure they're, quote, strong culturally, but not really their own culture,
[26:33.000 --> 26:42.000]  a plastic globalist culture that is injected in by MTV and by the social engineers.
[26:42.000 --> 26:53.000]  And then meanwhile, you better go along with what we want you to do politically on guns or Obamacare or whatever the case is, or you're racist.
[26:53.000 --> 27:01.000]  And it doesn't matter if it's not connected to any reality. It doesn't matter.
[27:01.000 --> 27:07.000]  Because it's a mere threat of being called racist. You say, okay, I'll do what you say.
[27:07.000 --> 27:16.000]  Aka two different universities in Colorado this year and last year said you can't have parties, costume parties at Halloween or any other time,
[27:16.000 --> 27:23.000]  where you're a cowboy, where you are a geisha girl, where you're a Native American.
[27:23.000 --> 27:28.000]  I had a listener send me a beautiful Indian headdress. I need to think I'm on air. I keep forgetting to do that.
[27:28.000 --> 27:34.000]  And I mean, have I ever wore that on air? Would it be racist?
[27:34.000 --> 27:41.000]  If I go eat German food, is it against Germans? And you think I'm joking? This is where it's all going.
[27:41.000 --> 27:53.000]  The Daily Caller has the headline. It's official at Dartmouth. The word fiesta is racist and white people can't use it.
[27:53.000 --> 28:00.000]  The local campus paper reports that pi delta alpha fraternity cannot have fiesta parties.
[28:00.000 --> 28:08.000]  And next, they're not going to be able to have Greek parties as well. Toga parties are obviously to insult Greek people, ladies and gentlemen.
[28:08.000 --> 28:19.000]  Another ridiculous politically correct, Brewha Hawes broke out of Dartmouth College, America's most hopelessly and disturbingly fragile Ivy League school.
[28:19.000 --> 28:24.000]  And it goes on to say that they cannot have it.
[28:24.000 --> 28:30.000]  A, because the fraternity there locally only has one Hispanic person that would be going for the party.
[28:30.000 --> 28:36.000]  So to say it's fiesta style, well, that's it. You got to change the name of fiesta Texas, because white people might be going there.
[28:36.000 --> 28:44.000]  This is to get everybody totally uncomfortable on eggshells, not worried about all the real discrimination going on by the globalist against us all.
[28:44.000 --> 28:51.000]  That's how they divide and conquer us. And I know you know that, but we've got to get that message out that while the system's trying to get us at each other's throats,
[28:51.000 --> 28:57.000]  the Congress has a 6% approval rating, whether they're black or white, Hispanic, Asian, it doesn't matter.
[28:57.000 --> 29:04.000]  They work for the globalist. They have been made exempt from insider trading laws. They've been made exempt from social security.
[29:04.000 --> 29:11.000]  Did you know Congress is exempt from almost all the laws they pass? They actually put in the bills that they're exempt?
[29:11.000 --> 29:25.000]  That is the heart of tyranny, the heart of discrimination, where the royalty is above the law. Kim Jong-un can do it, but you can't do it as a commoner in North Korea.
[29:25.000 --> 29:37.000]  The fact that Sterling at Clippers got his building paid for is an abomination robbing all of us.
[29:37.000 --> 29:42.000]  I'm going to give the number out when we come back. I want to hear specifically from black folks. I guess that is a crematory to everybody else,
[29:42.000 --> 29:49.000]  but I want to hear from you. Am I wrong? Straight ahead. On the other side, I'm going to give the number out. We'll be right back.
[29:49.000 --> 30:00.000]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.000 --> 30:07.000]  In the last 50 years, iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine,
[30:07.000 --> 30:14.000]  a practice now banned in nations around the world. Guess what else is in the halogen family? Fluoride.
[30:14.000 --> 30:22.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, Alex Jones here. In 1924, the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine.
[30:22.000 --> 30:33.000]  It's the good halogen on the periodic table, and the results are on record, reports documented, a 15-point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine.
[30:33.000 --> 30:42.000]  Bottom line, iodine is important. Unbound, clean, in a glycerin base, nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family.
[30:42.000 --> 30:52.000]  You will find Survival Shield nascent iodine exclusively at InfowarsLife.com. InfowarsLife Survival Shield nascent iodine isn't just for emergencies.
[30:52.000 --> 31:00.000]  I take it every day. That's InfowarsLife.com or call toll-free 888-253-3139.
[31:00.000 --> 31:10.000]  From the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself, our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day, but it's not just the air outside that's toxic.
[31:10.000 --> 31:21.000]  Indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air, and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals within their homes.
[31:21.000 --> 31:28.000]  There are more than 42 million smokers in the United States. Well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions.
[31:28.000 --> 31:33.000]  And don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well.
[31:33.000 --> 31:43.000]  When I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape until we can fight back against.
[31:43.000 --> 31:54.000]  Made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the U.S.A. The new InfowarsLife Lung Cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment.
[31:54.000 --> 32:01.000]  Now available exclusively at InfowarsLife.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[32:01.000 --> 32:10.000]  It's here to tell you about how you can help spread liberty worldwide while also enjoying what I have found to be the best tasting 100% organic coffee on the planet.
[32:10.000 --> 32:18.000]  For more than a decade my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans.
[32:18.000 --> 32:23.000]  We have now managed to secure these sought after beans in a highly customized blend.
[32:23.000 --> 32:37.000]  Discover and try a bag of the Patriot Blend 100% organic coffee at InfowarsLife.com. This coffee gives you a long smooth pick me up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally.
[32:37.000 --> 32:44.000]  Hands down this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers.
[32:44.000 --> 32:58.000]  Brought by the site today order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed. Available in original or with our immune support infusion blend. You will be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee.
[32:58.000 --> 33:15.000]  Available at infowarslife.com.
[33:15.000 --> 33:28.000]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[33:28.000 --> 33:45.000]  Live from the Infowars.com studios it's Alex Jones.
[33:58.000 --> 34:18.000]  That a fight to good fight ladies and gentlemen.
[34:18.000 --> 34:23.000]  Monday through Friday from 11am to 2pm we're here live.
[34:23.000 --> 34:28.000]  Back weeknight 7 o'clock Central Infowars Nightly News.
[34:28.000 --> 34:37.000]  The reason I'm opening the phones up right now specifically on the whole clipper situation is it's designed to rub salt in the wounds.
[34:37.000 --> 34:43.000]  The fact that the media always obsesses on this and then they dangle it out there what's going to happen to him.
[34:43.000 --> 34:46.000]  Great boy caught him running out of the business with a free market.
[34:46.000 --> 35:01.000]  The issue here though is the way people transcend things is getting thick skins and not caring and not letting people control you by racial politics and programming.
[35:01.000 --> 35:13.000]  The system wants to keep it going the Democratic Party and I'm not defending the Republicans it's just a fact they couldn't win elections anymore by the mid sixties.
[35:13.000 --> 35:21.000]  Not all the Democratic Party but a large part of it in the south definitely was the party of the Klan was the racist party.
[35:21.000 --> 35:31.000]  And they openly said we will then engage in racial politics but with the minorities and that's how we'll dominate the future and they've now basically done it.
[35:31.000 --> 35:43.000]  So they need the racism to stimulate the minorities to be racially based themselves so that you will do whatever they say turn your guns in support high taxes.
[35:43.000 --> 35:50.000]  Torture wars as long as you get fed.
[35:50.000 --> 36:01.000]  Racial cultural tribalism that you're a protected group that you've been wronged as long as you get patted on the head you don't care of the system slush your throat.
[36:01.000 --> 36:05.000]  They are playing everybody off against each other.
[36:05.000 --> 36:10.000]  And I know you know that I know that.
[36:10.000 --> 36:23.000]  And there's all sorts of racist crowd going on on on every side there's there's a lead ism folks where if you go on the wrong bar the wrong biker bar they'll say hey you're not part of the skulls or whatever.
[36:23.000 --> 36:35.000]  Or you're not part of the the Mongols or you're not part of the banditos it's not even about race it's that you're not part of their group humans like to organize themselves into I'm a member of this country club.
[36:35.000 --> 36:38.000]  And you're not welcome here.
[36:38.000 --> 36:44.000]  People love exclusivity and race and religion becomes the ultimate exclusivity.
[36:44.000 --> 36:49.000]  That's why there's 10,000 plus Christian denominations or more.
[36:49.000 --> 36:51.000]  Because everybody loves to be exclusive.
[36:51.000 --> 36:55.000]  They've got over a million gods it's estimated in India.
[36:55.000 --> 37:00.000]  Because people like to create something new and have exclusivity.
[37:00.000 --> 37:07.000]  That's a normal human trait well I belong to the Renaissance exclusivity group that's inclusive.
[37:07.000 --> 37:15.000]  I belong to the human empowerment crew or gang or tribe.
[37:15.000 --> 37:26.000]  I belong to the group that wants to accelerate human development expand liberty expand human endeavors and development.
[37:26.000 --> 37:44.000]  And only by unifying around basic human liberty basic human determination and freedom and basic individualism judging someone as an individual not as the race they identify with that is so incredibly important.
[37:44.000 --> 37:50.000]  That doesn't mean there might not be a whole group of racist in some group that doesn't like you and you've got to deal with them and they're your enemy.
[37:50.000 --> 37:58.000]  But you realize they're programmed by tribalism they're coming after you because they're primitive.
[37:58.000 --> 38:02.000]  Now there are people on the other side of that who are not primitive.
[38:02.000 --> 38:10.000]  Al Sharpton is not primitive. Jesse Jackson is not primitive. Rachel Maddow is not primitive.
[38:10.000 --> 38:20.000]  The race baiters on MSNBC they're using the claim of trying to end racism as a way to keep it going and expanding race pimping it.
[38:20.000 --> 38:27.000]  But there are people that are ignorant that buy into it and play into the whole race religion.
[38:27.000 --> 38:37.000]  From the perspective of those fighting against it then there are those who aren't really racist but use racism as a cultural tool from other sides.
[38:37.000 --> 38:43.000]  White racist groups you name it but you'll also find those groups are very exclusive separately to other groups.
[38:43.000 --> 38:48.000]  The clan routinely attacks somebody that moves in from another county who's white.
[38:48.000 --> 38:54.000]  It's an excuse to prey on you. It's an excuse to break in your house. It's an excuse to take your job.
[38:54.000 --> 38:59.000]  It's an excuse because why you're from outside this area.
[38:59.000 --> 39:12.000]  And so by understanding how the human psychology works we are able to transcend it but it doesn't mean we don't still have to deal with it because it's going to be going on.
[39:12.000 --> 39:20.000]  But MSNBC is supporting funding al Qaeda attacking all these different countries murdering Christians Muslim minorities in mass.
[39:20.000 --> 39:27.000]  They don't want to talk about that. They want to talk about how somebody you know some rich billionaires tax.
[39:27.000 --> 39:33.000]  They're not the most tax exempt. I want to talk about that. They're talking about how he said something racist secretly.
[39:33.000 --> 39:44.000]  I mean who cares. Everybody then piles on to it to be politically correct because it's the easy thing to do.
[39:44.000 --> 39:56.000]  And I agree with Mark Cuban that it's disgusting and despicable but still why doesn't Mark Cuban add it's wrong that the ultra rich are basically playing by different rules
[39:56.000 --> 40:03.000]  and somewhat tax exempt. Mark Cuban is not part of the insider club. I've witnessed that in the news.
[40:03.000 --> 40:08.000]  But listen there's no point in talking about this unless we really talk about where it all comes from.
[40:08.000 --> 40:16.000]  So I'd like to hear from callers out there from a black perspective. There's no way for me to be politically correct.
[40:16.000 --> 40:26.000]  I mean even the word fiesta is racist now. So black folks have said they wanted to be called colored Negro African American.
[40:26.000 --> 40:35.000]  Now people say don't call folks that. I'll just call you people call folks white folks. I'll call you black folks see because we have to use these words.
[40:35.000 --> 40:44.000]  We have to use language or the globalists are going to restrict us so much that we can't even communicate and talk to ever even get down to the bottom line.
[40:44.000 --> 40:57.000]  Over all just human beings and then deal with the real discrimination of hydrofluorosalic acid put in the water to lower the IQs of Anglos around 10 points after six years of use.
[40:57.000 --> 41:05.000]  Do you know what hydrofluorosalic acid does to the average black person or whatever reason it hurts blacks even worse.
[41:05.000 --> 41:10.000]  You can type into a search engine fluoride hurts blacks worse than whites.
[41:10.000 --> 41:19.000]  But hey is that fun and sexy to complain about that water has stuff added to it to brain damage you and your family.
[41:19.000 --> 41:23.000]  Or the fact that 52% of blacks are aborted.
[41:23.000 --> 41:37.000]  See if I really didn't like you I'd get up here and talk about how much I love you all day and how much welfare is good for you and how great it is to not have men in the house and how great violent hip hop is and you know how great Planned Parenthood is
[41:37.000 --> 41:51.000]  and how great your your right to choices and how great inoculations are and how great that city water is.
[41:51.000 --> 41:54.000]  You see this is the reality.
[41:54.000 --> 42:01.000]  There's the headline 50% of all African American pregnancies in an abortion but that's okay.
[42:01.000 --> 42:03.000]  That's okay.
[42:03.000 --> 42:05.000]  That's a good liberal thing.
[42:05.000 --> 42:08.000]  Shopping up babies is a okay.
[42:08.000 --> 42:12.000]  But the mere fact that I'm white see I'm suspect.
[42:12.000 --> 42:14.000]  Well that's that's the racism.
[42:14.000 --> 42:22.000]  Not even reverse racism it's the racism and the stereotypes that are ubiquitous in a dumb down society.
[42:22.000 --> 42:30.000]  New Yorkers that I know are great people but they move down here and they go man I thought you people rode horses to work.
[42:30.000 --> 42:33.000]  We thought Texans were dumb.
[42:33.000 --> 42:39.000]  Well yeah you could certainly go to rural areas and find some really dumb down people.
[42:39.000 --> 42:41.000]  There's all the smart folks moving to the city.
[42:41.000 --> 42:43.000]  There are a lot of smart people still in the countryside.
[42:43.000 --> 42:46.000]  You can find some of the dumbest black people in the countryside.
[42:46.000 --> 42:50.000]  You can also find some of the smartest black people in the countryside.
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  So again that's a stereotype.
[42:52.000 --> 42:57.000]  That's why you've got to get down to actually going off of what people stand for.
[42:57.000 --> 43:04.000]  There's a lot of sexism of family law in the U.S. where it's just taken as a default that women get possession of the children.
[43:04.000 --> 43:09.000]  That's all changing now as men realize they're being discriminated against and come together.
[43:09.000 --> 43:11.000]  Not against women.
[43:11.000 --> 43:13.000]  Not that women are bad.
[43:13.000 --> 43:16.000]  It's that the system has been set up to say men shouldn't have their kids.
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  That system is discriminatory.
[43:18.000 --> 43:23.000]  Men need to come together and reclaim our rights and our liberty and our freedom.
[43:23.000 --> 43:31.000]  We need to all come together and say we have a right to not be secretly medically experimented on with shifilis in the vaccines.
[43:31.000 --> 43:33.000]  Oh you heard of that?
[43:33.000 --> 43:39.000]  The same government that did that now wants to give you a free abortion because they love you so much black people.
[43:39.000 --> 43:44.000]  For the White House Science, ours own book Eco Science with a fluoride in the water.
[43:44.000 --> 43:49.000]  We've got to come together and realize the big issue here.
[43:49.000 --> 43:52.000]  The big issue here.
[43:52.000 --> 43:58.000]  Is that we're being socially engineered because the globalists have a 6% approval rating.
[43:58.000 --> 44:07.000]  And if we ever figure out that they're attacking us, that they're eugenicists going after all of us, playing Catholic off against Orthodox in Ukraine,
[44:07.000 --> 44:16.000]  playing Black Tribe off against Black Tribe in Nigeria, playing North off against South here in the U.S.
[44:16.000 --> 44:24.000]  I watch grown adults argue with each other about, I'm for the Spurs, well I'm for the Mavericks, you better watch it.
[44:24.000 --> 44:27.000]  Again, more mindless tribalism.
[44:27.000 --> 44:32.000]  You care more about who wins your sports team, if your team loses you go out and riot.
[44:32.000 --> 44:38.000]  You won't riot when foreign banks steal tens of trillions of dollars from you and your taxes go up.
[44:38.000 --> 44:40.000]  You're not worried about that.
[44:40.000 --> 44:47.000]  We've tried to sell a train, a so-called bullet train from San Antonio to Austin for 20 years.
[44:47.000 --> 44:50.000]  Boondoggle, Republicans don't want it, Democrats don't want it.
[44:50.000 --> 44:53.000]  It's over 80% unpopular in polls.
[44:53.000 --> 45:00.000]  Now it's suddenly popular because they're saying, sports fans get to the Spurs game quicker from Austin,
[45:00.000 --> 45:06.000]  Georgetown and Round Rock, and suddenly they're going, yeah, yeah, if it's a sports boondoggle, I'm for it.
[45:06.000 --> 45:13.000]  Let's build a $5 billion train that you got to drive in cars to a parking lot,
[45:13.000 --> 45:20.000]  go through German Shepherd checkpoints, get on the stupid train that still takes 45 minutes to get to San Antonio,
[45:20.000 --> 45:27.000]  then get in trains and go to the stupid basketball game.
[45:27.000 --> 45:33.000]  I don't want to pay for your train, your dungeon.
[45:33.000 --> 45:41.000]  I don't want to be part of your police state.
[45:41.000 --> 45:48.000]  I'm so angry. I'm so sick of it. I'm so tired of it.
[45:48.000 --> 45:53.000]  I'm so tired of red carpets and helicopters and Air Force One for all these royalty and the government.
[45:53.000 --> 46:00.000]  I'm so sick of old ladies and people having their houses taken when they don't pay their taxes so the rich elite can suck off everybody
[46:00.000 --> 46:07.000]  and tell us we're not paying our fair share. Well, they've got a giant throng of welfare queens and people that are dependent on the system.
[46:07.000 --> 46:13.000]  So they'll vote to take my freedom so they keep getting handouts from the government.
[46:13.000 --> 46:21.000]  People are slaves on the welfare plantations today. It doesn't endorse the old slavery to say that you're a slave today.
[46:21.000 --> 46:27.000]  At least people 170, 180 years ago knew they were slaves and knew people didn't want them having their families together.
[46:27.000 --> 46:33.000]  Now people don't even know that because they brought in high-tech slavery on record and did it and they love it.
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.000]  And now they've got psychological slavery over people.
[46:36.000 --> 46:40.000]  I want to hear from black folks. We're going to discriminate here, black folks only.
[46:40.000 --> 46:44.000]  I want to get your take on this. Am I wrong or am I right?
[46:44.000 --> 46:50.000]  And how do we break this system of control to where they can't say you're racist if you're against Obamacare?
[46:50.000 --> 46:58.000]  800-259-9231, 800-259-9231.
[46:58.000 --> 47:01.000]  Now I want to play a clip of Elizabeth Warren, the senator.
[47:01.000 --> 47:04.000]  We're going to go to break. Come back and start taking your phone calls.
[47:04.000 --> 47:07.000]  Can we push the professor instead of me having her on the first 40 minutes?
[47:07.000 --> 47:10.000]  Can we push the professor to like 15 after?
[47:10.000 --> 47:12.000]  Yeah, I really want her on. I saw you testing her Skype.
[47:12.000 --> 47:16.000]  We're going to look forward to that on epigenetics to get into how the elite are controlling us.
[47:16.000 --> 47:20.000]  But I want to get to Elizabeth Warren, who I don't agree with on some things,
[47:20.000 --> 47:29.000]  but I think she comes off as a genuine person and she's on John Stewart's show talking about how the game is rigged
[47:29.000 --> 47:31.000]  and how the elite have everything rigged.
[47:31.000 --> 47:33.000]  But he says, but it's always been that way.
[47:33.000 --> 47:35.000]  Well, his brother's the head of the New York Stock Exchange.
[47:35.000 --> 47:37.000]  So he's their kind of whitewashing thing.
[47:37.000 --> 47:40.000]  She says, no, it's more rigged now than ever.
[47:40.000 --> 47:43.000]  So here she is telling you what I'm telling you.
[47:43.000 --> 47:51.000]  The ultimate discrimination is that we lived in a rigged economy where the winners have already been chosen.
[47:51.000 --> 47:55.000]  They've got you convinced that the winners are white people.
[47:55.000 --> 47:58.000]  White people haven't been perfect, folks, but they got a little bit of independence.
[47:58.000 --> 48:01.000]  We're able to build up families and some wealth.
[48:01.000 --> 48:04.000]  So now the elite want that gone so everybody's poor.
[48:04.000 --> 48:07.000]  So there's no ladder up, ladies and gentlemen.
[48:07.000 --> 48:10.000]  Everything they've done to black folks, they're not doing to everybody.
[48:10.000 --> 48:14.000]  The society's all collapsing. Black folks are just falling the fastest.
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  You're skydiving without a parachute.
[48:16.000 --> 48:20.000]  Don't worry, white folks are 100 feet above you without a parachute as well.
[48:20.000 --> 48:27.000]  We need to figure out how to have a soft landing here and realize the real enemies are engaged in divide and conquer.
[48:27.000 --> 48:29.000]  Let's go ahead and go to Elizabeth Warren.
[48:29.000 --> 48:31.000]  Very powerful clip from the Daily Show.
[48:31.000 --> 48:32.000]  And what happened?
[48:32.000 --> 48:37.000]  This government came back and it bailed out those big financial institutions.
[48:37.000 --> 48:46.000]  Today those big financial institutions are 38% bigger than they were in 2008 when we said they were too big to fail.
[48:46.000 --> 48:50.000]  They still break the law and nobody goes to jail.
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  I don't know about you, but I think that's wrong.
[48:52.000 --> 48:57.000]  Too much of the rules and the regulations are written by the lobbyists.
[48:57.000 --> 49:02.000]  And so it's not an over under, it's a wrong.
[49:02.000 --> 49:09.000]  They keep tilting the playing field to make it work better for the biggest corporations and for billionaires.
[49:09.000 --> 49:14.000]  And every time that happens, it works less and less well for families.
[49:14.000 --> 49:19.000]  It really is a rigged game and it's set up now over and over.
[49:19.000 --> 49:21.000]  And it's probably always been.
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  Well, not like this.
[49:23.000 --> 49:28.000]  It's set up over and over and over that the rich get richer and the powerful get more powerful.
[49:28.000 --> 49:32.000]  They've got all the advantages of concentrated money and concentrated power.
[49:32.000 --> 49:36.000]  All we got on the other side is we got our voices and we got our votes.
[49:36.000 --> 49:40.000]  And if we get out there and make something out of them, that's how we make a difference.
[49:40.000 --> 49:44.000]  Every time you tell me that things can't change, I'll just say back to you.
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.
[49:46.000 --> 49:49.000]  The bank said we will kill it.
[49:49.000 --> 49:51.000]  Let's stop right there.
[49:51.000 --> 49:53.000]  And she's been calling for some pretty good reforms.
[49:53.000 --> 50:00.000]  The problem is the Democrats answer was Occupy Wall Street that's just socialism and raise taxes on middle class.
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  Do what Kennedy did.
[50:02.000 --> 50:06.000]  Cut the middle class tax rate by 50%.
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  Do you know what happened the next year?
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  Tax receipts doubled.
[50:10.000 --> 50:11.000]  I'll explain that again.
[50:11.000 --> 50:12.000]  Tax receipts doubled.
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  Double the money came in.
[50:14.000 --> 50:19.000]  But the government is run by corporations that don't want that because they're not paying taxes.
[50:19.000 --> 50:24.000]  They don't want their competition to have the money.
[50:24.000 --> 50:27.000]  That's you and me.
[50:27.000 --> 50:32.000]  With our industrial base folks, we should be working two days a week conservatively.
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  The studies are legion.
[50:34.000 --> 50:37.000]  We can all be living like kings right now.
[50:37.000 --> 50:39.000]  Better forms of energy, everything.
[50:39.000 --> 50:40.000]  It's all being suppressed.
[50:40.000 --> 50:43.000]  We're being put into a new dark age.
[50:43.000 --> 50:47.000]  While the elite are moving forward with everything and they're on a power trip,
[50:47.000 --> 50:52.000]  we're shutting up a police state in case we try to stop them.
[50:52.000 --> 50:53.000]  It's rigged folks.
[50:53.000 --> 50:55.000]  We've got to start admitting that.
[50:55.000 --> 50:58.000]  And now they want to rig the internet to shut down free speech.
[50:58.000 --> 51:26.000]  Your calls are coming up.

[52:02.000 --> 52:07.000]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk and his team of patriots over at MyPatriots supply.
[52:07.000 --> 52:10.000]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment,
[52:10.000 --> 52:12.000]  frustrated with the direction this country was headed,
[52:12.000 --> 52:15.000]  and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[52:15.000 --> 52:20.000]  Deciding to take action, a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[52:20.000 --> 52:24.000]  MyPatriots supply has never taken a loan or accepted outside funding.
[52:24.000 --> 52:30.000]  They now operate two distribution facilities and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[52:30.000 --> 52:33.000]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach,
[52:33.000 --> 52:39.000]  and that's why I stock my pantry with high-quality, storeable foods from MyPatriots supply.
[52:39.000 --> 52:44.000]  Go to MyPatriotsupply.com. For special offers on emergency food storage,
[52:44.000 --> 52:50.000]  or call their preparedness specialist at 866-229-0927.
[52:50.000 --> 52:56.000]  That's 866-229-0927. Do business with someone who shares your values.

[53:03.000 --> 53:08.000]  In the U.S., one in every 50 homes will have a break in this year.
[53:08.000 --> 53:12.000]  Burglars call it smash and grab. Police call it robbery.
[53:12.000 --> 53:16.000]  We call it avoidable. We are fake TV.
[53:16.000 --> 53:21.000]  A simple electronic device that can fool even professional burglars.
[53:21.000 --> 53:26.000]  Fake TV easily plugs into any outlet and simulates the changing colors of a television.
[53:26.000 --> 53:30.000]  To a burglar, it looks like someone must be home watching TV,
[53:30.000 --> 53:33.000]  so they'll likely move on to an easier target.
[53:33.000 --> 53:39.000]  At only $29.95, fake TV costs less than a month of most alarm monitoring plans
[53:39.000 --> 53:45.000]  and comes with free shipping. Order your fake TV by calling 877-5-FAKE-TV
[53:45.000 --> 53:53.000]  or go to faketv.com. That's 877-532-5388 or faketv.com.
[53:53.000 --> 53:56.000]  Fake TV, the burglar deterrent.

[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:54.040]  I hate Jerry Jones.
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:57.400]  I hate Eccleston with the Formula One track.
[01:00:57.400 --> 01:01:01.440]  I mean, they have robbed me with state and local taxes
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:04.400]  to pay for their multi-billion dollar facilities.
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:05.320]  They robbed you.
[01:01:06.440 --> 01:01:09.200]  Nothing makes me madder than some rich guy's tax exempt.
[01:01:10.200 --> 01:01:12.360]  Who, by the way, lectures me that I gotta raise
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:13.660]  my taxes to pay them.
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.480]  That's the discrimination.
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.160]  And it makes me wanna throw up.
[01:01:20.160 --> 01:01:22.440]  I don't care if a team owner's black or white.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:23.800]  I don't like them if I'm having to pay
[01:01:23.800 --> 01:01:25.040]  for their sports stadium.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:29.760]  But if they get everybody racially obsessed,
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:32.240]  they can say, hey, you want guns, you're racist.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:34.520]  You don't like Obamacare, it's cause you don't like Obama.
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.920]  No, I don't like Obamacare because it's a big screw job
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:38.120]  cause I studied the bill.
[01:01:39.680 --> 01:01:41.800]  But I don't get into this racial division stuff.
[01:01:41.800 --> 01:01:44.800]  I do cover it though, so people understand what's happening.
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:46.760]  Maybe folks disagree.
[01:01:46.760 --> 01:01:51.520]  We're gonna talk to P, Daryl Hollins and Eli.
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:52.840]  P, you're on the air.
[01:01:52.840 --> 01:01:54.240]  Welcome from Florida.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.120]  What's your take on this?
[01:01:56.120 --> 01:01:58.240]  Well, you know, I'm African-American.
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.560]  I'm black as well.
[01:01:59.560 --> 01:02:01.520]  I'm here, I'm with my girlfriend.
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.360]  We've been watching the show.
[01:02:03.360 --> 01:02:07.280]  She watches every day and she told me to call in
[01:02:07.280 --> 01:02:10.680]  because I'm not really a watcher that much.
[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:11.760]  I don't really got time for this.
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:12.600]  No, no, I understand.
[01:02:12.600 --> 01:02:14.160]  I mean, you're giving us your real take on it.
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.440]  Go ahead.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:19.120]  Yeah, my take is basically that this dude right here
[01:02:19.120 --> 01:02:23.200]  with the yelling about the black people,
[01:02:23.200 --> 01:02:27.520]  I think he needs to watch his mouth, you know what I'm saying?
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:30.920]  Because that's kind of disrespectful.
[01:02:30.920 --> 01:02:31.760]  Well, no kidding.
[01:02:31.760 --> 01:02:36.280]  The guy's obviously out of his mind, completely delusional.
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:39.160]  Most of his team's black and he's friends
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:40.760]  with these people on the surface.
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:44.040]  And then meanwhile, talking trash about,
[01:02:44.040 --> 01:02:45.680]  I mean, I think the main thing is he's mad
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:46.840]  that she's running around on him.
[01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.240]  But what does he expect?
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.760]  The guy's just an idiot.
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:52.760]  My point is, do you get the fact that they're hyping it
[01:02:52.760 --> 01:02:56.560]  to create a diversion from how we're all being robbed?
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:01.880]  Well, I see what you're saying about how I'm being robbed
[01:03:01.880 --> 01:03:04.520]  because when I went to the mall,
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:06.400]  I went to go buy a pair of Jordans
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:11.400]  and the price was like $135 and I only make $275 per week.
[01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:15.320]  So I'm trying to figure out why would I buy these sneakers
[01:03:15.320 --> 01:03:17.520]  that have so much money, you know what I'm saying?
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:18.840]  Exactly, exactly.
[01:03:18.840 --> 01:03:22.040]  And they sell it as culture, so you'll pay more for it
[01:03:22.040 --> 01:03:24.400]  when it was actually made by Chinese slaves.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.280]  And it's just incredible, really good points.
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:27.280]  Appreciate your call.
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:29.920]  Eli in New York, go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:03:29.920 --> 01:03:31.240]  Hello, Alex.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:34.800]  Yeah, I too am African American black,
[01:03:34.800 --> 01:03:38.800]  whatever the million different kinds of names they put
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:41.480]  to anyone who has a little melanin in their skin,
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:43.680]  but I completely agree,
[01:03:43.680 --> 01:03:47.200]  these racially divisive tactics have completely
[01:03:47.200 --> 01:03:49.680]  put a smokescreen up and most people are plugged into
[01:03:49.680 --> 01:03:52.800]  the matrix of the news and sports and get sucked into
[01:03:52.800 --> 01:03:56.040]  these ridiculous debates while these snakes
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:58.120]  strangle us all and it's ridiculous.
[01:03:58.120 --> 01:04:01.080]  And I try, as the best I can, living in Harlem,
[01:04:01.080 --> 01:04:04.960]  there are two groups, they're the more politically aware
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:08.760]  older groups and the more politically aware groups
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.680]  and we, you know, it's really tough to, you know,
[01:04:12.680 --> 01:04:14.800]  try to get this through to people that don't,
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:17.080]  I mean, this is known, Donald Sterling has been known
[01:04:17.080 --> 01:04:19.600]  to be a racist, this is not the first thing he said,
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:22.480]  then did these things come up at the most ridiculous times
[01:04:22.480 --> 01:04:24.600]  when, you know, World War III might start in Ukraine
[01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:27.240]  while these banks rob us until there's nothing left,
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:29.480]  you know, it just pisses me off,
[01:04:29.480 --> 01:04:33.000]  just like the war on poverty, the war on racism,
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.760]  as if it's gonna disappear one day, it's ridiculous.
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:37.640]  Great points, anything else?
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.640]  No, I mean, I just want to, you know,
[01:04:39.640 --> 01:04:40.880]  tell you to keep doing what you're doing
[01:04:40.880 --> 01:04:42.560]  and, you know, your message is getting through
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:45.880]  to all cultures, all races, it's about humanity,
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:47.720]  it's not about skin color or religion.
[01:04:47.720 --> 01:04:50.560]  Exactly, hey, we're all getting chemtrails.
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:52.520]  We're all, they're putting stuff in all the vaccines,
[01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:54.440]  they're coming after everybody and that's my point,
[01:04:54.440 --> 01:04:56.520]  that's what they want us fighting with each other.
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:59.440]  More calls coming up, Daryl, others, stay with us.
[01:05:00.720 --> 01:05:03.160]  A chemical spill contaminating the water supply
[01:05:03.160 --> 01:05:04.840]  in nine West Virginia counties.
[01:05:04.840 --> 01:05:07.480]  This year alone, over 300,000 people in West Virginia
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:09.120]  had their drinking water contaminate.
[01:05:09.120 --> 01:05:10.400]  What are the health effects
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:12.760]  of having these drugs in our drinking water?
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:14.040]  It's forced medical treatment
[01:05:14.040 --> 01:05:15.800]  without the consent of residents.
[01:05:15.800 --> 01:05:18.760]  My friend's water filtration is one of the most basic actions
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:20.600]  you can take to protect you and your family
[01:05:20.600 --> 01:05:23.360]  from the harmful toxins and heavy metals in your tap water.
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:26.000]  On average, the county says it sprays with glyphosate
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:27.320]  at least once a week.
[01:05:27.320 --> 01:05:29.400]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:31.680]  that is found in water supplies worldwide.
[01:05:31.680 --> 01:05:34.240]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines,
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:37.840]  hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate.
[01:05:37.840 --> 01:05:39.720]  All right, it is in tea, it's in coffee,
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:41.640]  it's in water, it's in breads, it's in toothpaste.
[01:05:41.640 --> 01:05:44.400]  It is our responsibility to protect our families.
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:45.840]  The establishment's not gonna do it.
[01:05:45.840 --> 01:05:47.200]  It's time to take action.
[01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:49.080]  It's time to filter our water.

[01:06:00.760 --> 01:06:03.480]  Why does the United States spend the largest percentage
[01:06:03.480 --> 01:06:05.480]  of GDP in the world on healthcare?
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:08.600]  Why do we have the highest cancer rates on the planet?
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:11.520]  The highest rates of diabetes, autism,
[01:06:11.520 --> 01:06:14.120]  and every other major disease?
[01:06:14.120 --> 01:06:17.640]  It all comes down to one thing, we are what we eat.
[01:06:17.640 --> 01:06:19.840]  Our food is devoid of nutrition
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:22.320]  and processed with poisons and additives.
[01:06:22.320 --> 01:06:26.560]  Our water is filled with toxic poisons and big pharma runoff.
[01:06:26.560 --> 01:06:29.160]  All of this has been engineered by design.
[01:06:29.160 --> 01:06:31.840]  We can turn the tide against the eugenicists
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:35.400]  by giving ourselves the nutrients our body desperately needs.

[01:07:00.680 --> 01:07:03.480]  Hi, folks, Alex Jones here with some important information.
[01:07:03.480 --> 01:07:05.480]  I want to tell you about Matt Redhawk
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:08.600]  and his team of patriots over at MyPatriot Supply.
[01:07:08.600 --> 01:07:10.280]  Several years ago, Matt was sitting
[01:07:10.280 --> 01:07:11.520]  in his two-bedroom apartment,
[01:07:11.520 --> 01:07:13.840]  frustrated with the direction this country was headed
[01:07:13.840 --> 01:07:16.760]  and the charlatans willing to sell us out for a quick buck.
[01:07:16.760 --> 01:07:18.240]  Deciding to take action,
[01:07:18.240 --> 01:07:21.280]  a company run by patriots for patriots was born.
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.880]  MyPatriot Supply has never taken a loan
[01:07:23.880 --> 01:07:25.280]  or accepted outside funding.
[01:07:25.280 --> 01:07:27.920]  They now operate two distribution facilities
[01:07:27.920 --> 01:07:31.160]  and employ over 50 hard-working American men and women.
[01:07:31.160 --> 01:07:34.360]  It is rare to find companies who practice what they preach
[01:07:34.360 --> 01:07:36.600]  and that's why I stock MyPatriot
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:39.760]  with high-quality storeable foods for MyPatriot Supply.

[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:04.120]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network
[01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:07.360]  proudly presents the Alex Jones Show
[01:08:07.360 --> 01:08:09.960]  because there's a war on for your mind.
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:22.520]  Seems like everybody I know knows someone
[01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:25.840]  who's dying of brain cancer from ages 25 or so
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:30.640]  up to 60, 70 and I love just to invite Dr. Group here
[01:08:30.640 --> 01:08:34.120]  every month or so and let him bring whatever topic is
[01:08:34.120 --> 01:08:35.480]  that he wants to cover.
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:37.120]  And today he gave me some of the points
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:38.320]  he wants to go over.
[01:08:39.560 --> 01:08:41.600]  The studies, I've got a stack of news on this
[01:08:41.600 --> 01:08:45.360]  about what smart meters, Wi-Fi,
[01:08:45.360 --> 01:08:47.920]  but especially cell phones are doing to your brain.
[01:08:47.920 --> 01:08:51.080]  It's a death sentence and I see people with phones
[01:08:51.080 --> 01:08:53.680]  up to their heads and I just go over and say something
[01:08:53.680 --> 01:08:56.040]  to them and then even I lose my hands freer,
[01:08:56.040 --> 01:08:58.520]  my headset and do it myself sometimes.
[01:08:59.440 --> 01:09:01.680]  We've got, if you've got cell phones folks,
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:05.200]  you've got because with microwave radiation,
[01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:09.800]  it reduces in power every distance.
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:13.240]  I've talked to engineers out from the length
[01:09:13.240 --> 01:09:16.560]  of the antenna basically or the wave
[01:09:16.560 --> 01:09:18.720]  and how the antenna is cut.
[01:09:18.720 --> 01:09:20.120]  But basically when you've got it right up
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:22.600]  against your brain, it's full power shooting
[01:09:22.600 --> 01:09:24.080]  right through your skull,
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:26.120]  only about a quarter inch into your brain.
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.800]  That's where these tumors are coming up.
[01:09:27.800 --> 01:09:29.560]  A lot of scientists have been going public,
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:32.480]  top doctors, they had studies back in the 60s on this,
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:35.400]  70s, 80s, we're gonna talk about that
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:38.520]  and more with him in the third hour today.
[01:09:38.520 --> 01:09:43.520]  But you can just pull up mainline CNN, BBC, you name it.
[01:09:43.680 --> 01:09:46.680]  But the big lobby is trying to act like it's no big deal.
[01:09:47.640 --> 01:09:48.920]  And sure, it's not good for you
[01:09:48.920 --> 01:09:50.720]  when it's a foot away from your head.
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:55.720]  But if you look at 12 inches away or 24 inches away,
[01:09:55.880 --> 01:09:58.280]  if it's sitting in the driver's side seat,
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:09:59.880]  you got a wire going to your head
[01:10:01.120 --> 01:10:03.280]  or if you're using a hands-free,
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:05.080]  then it's just a radio connection.
[01:10:05.080 --> 01:10:09.080]  It's literally hundreds of times not as strong.
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:13.600]  So if you're going to use these devices,
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:15.840]  it's like they finally told cops about a decade ago,
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:19.280]  don't sit in your car with the radar gun between your legs.
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:21.960]  Because even when you're not pulling the trigger,
[01:10:21.960 --> 01:10:23.920]  it's generating RF and the cops
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:28.080]  were all getting huge increases in testicular cancer.
[01:10:28.080 --> 01:10:30.880]  Just like TSA has huge cancer clusters,
[01:10:30.880 --> 01:10:33.000]  you sit around X-ray machines all day
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:37.520]  and they go, oh, well, they're shielded by some lead.
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.640]  That doesn't block all of it.
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:40.520]  It shoots out the front and the back.
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.760]  Now they've added more scanners in.
[01:10:43.760 --> 01:10:46.000]  It's a death sentence.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:47.640]  Look at the inventor of X-rays.
[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:50.880]  He died of cancer, young.
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:53.640]  So we're going to be talking about that.
[01:10:53.640 --> 01:10:55.880]  We got another professor coming on about epigenetics,
[01:10:55.880 --> 01:10:58.520]  really fascinating stuff here in a few minutes.
[01:10:59.600 --> 01:11:02.840]  I haven't gotten to all the other news that I've got here
[01:11:02.840 --> 01:11:04.640]  in front of me before I go back to your calls.
[01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:08.000]  All over the country, they're coming in with zoning laws
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.040]  to only let coffin apartments be built
[01:11:11.040 --> 01:11:12.440]  that are 200 square feet.
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:13.800]  Austin's now doing it.
[01:11:13.800 --> 01:11:16.360]  So they can charge you more per unit
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:18.360]  and get more property tax.
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:19.480]  How do you get more taxes?
[01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.640]  You lower standard of living.
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:23.240]  And that's out of Fox News,
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:26.560]  stackable container homes tested in New York City.
[01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:29.160]  And the argument is, oh, it's for poor people.
[01:11:29.160 --> 01:11:30.640]  No, it's not.
[01:11:30.640 --> 01:11:33.040]  It's being rolled out to lower the standards.
[01:11:33.040 --> 01:11:36.040]  It's a Jenna 21, get the book behind the green mask
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:39.760]  available at m4store.com, read it and understand it.
[01:11:39.760 --> 01:11:41.720]  Or my book that predicted it all,
[01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:43.680]  my film that predicted it all,
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:46.240]  in game blueprint for global enslavement,
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:48.000]  made eight years ago
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.040]  that says they're gonna build coffin houses.
[01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:52.560]  Because they said they would.
[01:11:52.560 --> 01:11:55.760]  And they say it's for control and surveillance.
[01:11:55.760 --> 01:11:57.520]  And they're gonna raise the taxes and stuff
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:59.600]  till they run everybody out of the country.
[01:11:59.600 --> 01:12:01.240]  That's what we've got to run to the country now,
[01:12:01.240 --> 01:12:02.640]  as many of us as we can,
[01:12:02.640 --> 01:12:05.440]  to build communities where we only buy from each other.
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:08.320]  I don't care what color you are,
[01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:10.960]  we discriminate against the big major corporations,
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.600]  the new world order.
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:14.240]  We don't do business with them,
[01:12:14.240 --> 01:12:16.200]  except when we absolutely have to.
[01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:17.640]  We go to mom and pops.
[01:12:17.640 --> 01:12:20.040]  We go to farmers markets.
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.920]  We support people.
[01:12:21.920 --> 01:12:24.360]  We hire veterans.
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:27.200]  We hire people that because of whatever culture
[01:12:27.200 --> 01:12:29.040]  they come out of, they've been discriminated against.
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:31.360]  If they show they've got what it takes.
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:35.360]  Oh, you're a veteran,
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:36.720]  they claim has all this stuff wrong with you,
[01:12:36.720 --> 01:12:38.360]  and we're gonna hire you.
[01:12:38.360 --> 01:12:39.960]  We don't believe the stereotype.
[01:12:39.960 --> 01:12:44.960]  So you see, that's how we defeat the classism,
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.200]  that isn't even just classism of rich people,
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.280]  not like in poor people.
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:51.480]  It's ultra technocracy, eugenicist,
[01:12:51.480 --> 01:12:53.520]  playing God over everyone.
[01:12:54.640 --> 01:12:57.360]  Like mad scientists, they're the enemy.
[01:12:57.360 --> 01:13:01.160]  I don't care what race or creed you are,
[01:13:01.160 --> 01:13:04.200]  we better come together against this and not let them win,
[01:13:04.200 --> 01:13:05.760]  because they're coming down on everybody.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:07.840]  Now I said I wanted to talk to black folks
[01:13:07.840 --> 01:13:09.600]  about their take on the Clippers deal.
[01:13:09.600 --> 01:13:12.920]  Am I wrong that this is being hyped for a diversion?
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:14.520]  This is not endorsing what the Clipper guy said,
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:15.760]  it's over the top.
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.720]  But some rich 80-year-old guy
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:20.680]  who's known to be an elitist racist,
[01:13:20.680 --> 01:13:22.800]  I'll guarantee you that guy hates everybody.
[01:13:23.800 --> 01:13:25.800]  And he's a hypocrite too.
[01:13:25.800 --> 01:13:28.800]  He's dating a lady that's like part black, Hispanic,
[01:13:28.800 --> 01:13:30.720]  I think a couple, I mean, big deal.
[01:13:30.720 --> 01:13:32.320]  He's out of his mind.
[01:13:33.240 --> 01:13:34.360]  He's a hypocrite.
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:38.200]  As I've read a statistic years ago,
[01:13:38.200 --> 01:13:40.760]  the number one area for interracial porn
[01:13:40.760 --> 01:13:42.080]  is the deep south.
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:43.240]  I mean, it's the same deal.
[01:13:43.240 --> 01:13:45.360]  Here's this guy who doesn't like quote minorities,
[01:13:45.360 --> 01:13:46.720]  and then he's dating his girlfriend
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:49.800]  that she looks like she's black and Asian to me.
[01:13:49.800 --> 01:13:51.560]  The whole point is just a bunch of,
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:53.760]  it's ridiculous, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:57.640]  It's absolutely ridiculous, okay?
[01:13:57.640 --> 01:14:00.120]  And I've already said it over and over again,
[01:14:00.120 --> 01:14:01.080]  let's just go to your phone calls.
[01:14:01.080 --> 01:14:04.080]  Daryl in Virginia, what is your take on this?
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:07.400]  Yes, sir, this is Cripp Ron Paul.
[01:14:07.400 --> 01:14:09.440]  I definitely want to get to that Snoop Dogg
[01:14:09.440 --> 01:14:12.280]  and Michael Jordan topic in just one second.
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:14.000]  But yeah, the distraction was going on.
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:15.640]  They're going to pass some crazy bill
[01:14:15.640 --> 01:14:19.040]  while the rest of America's being distracted by entertainment.
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:20.280]  Now we have to understand that yes,
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:22.720]  ignorance and racism still exists in all races,
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:25.080]  but why are we not out there bashing the real racist people?
[01:14:25.080 --> 01:14:29.160]  Like Eric Holder, Barack Obama, Ben Bernanke, Hillary Clinton,
[01:14:29.160 --> 01:14:32.280]  the real elitist that's actually killing people out there.
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:33.720]  Now, when it comes to this glue situation,
[01:14:33.720 --> 01:14:36.680]  like didn't you go positive with this Snoop line thing?
[01:14:36.680 --> 01:14:38.160]  Like went out to the piece of Snoop,
[01:14:38.160 --> 01:14:40.360]  all of a sudden you're bashing white people
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:43.280]  over someone that we already know
[01:14:43.280 --> 01:14:44.200]  was racist from the beginning.
[01:14:44.200 --> 01:14:47.760]  Like that's just, you promote ignorance in your music.
[01:14:47.760 --> 01:14:50.080]  Like he's the reason why I started gangbanging years ago,
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.440]  but you know, I woke up due to the ideologies
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:54.520]  of Ron Paul and listened to people like you
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:55.960]  and your show, like, right?
[01:14:55.960 --> 01:14:57.920]  We got to stop brainwashing the black community,
[01:14:57.920 --> 01:15:00.920]  like abortions kills more people,
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:02.880]  has killed more people than the KKK.
[01:15:02.880 --> 01:15:04.920]  There's more black murders in the urban community
[01:15:04.920 --> 01:15:07.680]  than in the history of the KKK in America.
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:10.680]  Like why are we letting the television brainwashing?
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:11.840]  We need to get people active,
[01:15:11.840 --> 01:15:14.160]  like how, you know, the panthers was back in days
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:16.920]  getting organized and getting people active.
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:18.040]  Now, I might be Jordan,
[01:15:18.040 --> 01:15:20.000]  like he destroyed the urban community.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.840]  How dare you say anything about racism
[01:15:21.840 --> 01:15:25.360]  when you're charging people $50 in the ghetto,
[01:15:25.360 --> 01:15:27.040]  where people spend their last bit of money
[01:15:27.040 --> 01:15:28.720]  where they don't buy the kids food
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:29.720]  because they're trying to stay fresh
[01:15:29.720 --> 01:15:30.560]  so to wear-
[01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:33.440]  And they're buying in to Michael Jordan,
[01:15:33.440 --> 01:15:36.320]  who I know reportedly behind the scenes is a real jerk.
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:39.360]  And, you know, just like he reportedly acts
[01:15:39.360 --> 01:15:40.960]  just like Lance Armstrong.
[01:15:40.960 --> 01:15:43.840]  He thinks he's God, everybody else is trash.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:46.600]  You know, his girlfriend gets cancer, I'm done with you.
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:48.040]  You know, he's like a newt Gennrich.
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:50.640]  I mean, these guys are the scum of the earth.
[01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:51.960]  I don't care what color they are.
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:55.240]  And what you're saying is absolutely on target
[01:15:55.240 --> 01:15:57.880]  the way the gangster culture, you know,
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:15:59.880]  the $300 tennis shoe culture
[01:15:59.880 --> 01:16:01.640]  and people think they've got status
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:04.200]  because they have that bling.
[01:16:04.200 --> 01:16:08.440]  And it's socially designed to absolutely annihilate
[01:16:08.440 --> 01:16:10.360]  the black community and it's done it.
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:13.400]  I mean, look, Christ said, you judge a tree by its fruits.
[01:16:13.400 --> 01:16:15.640]  And look at what modern liberalism
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:18.640]  and so-called multiculturalism has done.
[01:16:18.640 --> 01:16:20.640]  We are more divided.
[01:16:20.640 --> 01:16:22.720]  The communities are falling apart, but don't worry.
[01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:24.600]  They're not just done with the black people.
[01:16:24.600 --> 01:16:26.080]  They're gonna do it to everybody.
[01:16:26.080 --> 01:16:30.360]  And it's so sick to sit here and to see it
[01:16:30.360 --> 01:16:32.280]  and to see people totally captured by it.
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:33.880]  Anything else?
[01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:36.240]  Yeah, man, we gotta wake people up, man.
[01:16:36.240 --> 01:16:38.400]  If we don't unite now, it's gonna be black
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:39.840]  because the elite is taking over
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:41.800]  and it's gonna be us left behind.
[01:16:41.800 --> 01:16:42.680]  So yeah, that's it, brother.
[01:16:42.680 --> 01:16:44.760]  Cripp Ron Paul took me on my YouTube.
[01:16:44.760 --> 01:16:46.280]  All right, thank you so much.
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:48.920]  And yeah, the globalists do want to have a race war.
[01:16:48.920 --> 01:16:50.680]  Look how they're doing race war or religious war
[01:16:50.680 --> 01:16:54.200]  in Crimea, other areas.
[01:16:54.200 --> 01:16:57.240]  Look at using one Muslim group against another in Syria.
[01:16:57.240 --> 01:16:58.840]  The globalists divide and conquer
[01:16:58.840 --> 01:17:01.360]  the great games of Big New Brzezinski.
[01:17:01.360 --> 01:17:03.440]  Divide and conquer is the name of the game.
[01:17:03.440 --> 01:17:05.560]  It's the only way this tiny global elite
[01:17:05.560 --> 01:17:07.800]  can dominate the planet is divide and conquer.
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:08.760]  Balkanization.
[01:17:11.040 --> 01:17:13.240]  It's the only way they can do it.
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:17.080]  And I know you know that.
[01:17:17.080 --> 01:17:19.320]  We've gotta get that message out to people
[01:17:19.320 --> 01:17:22.560]  that we've gotta stand on morals, family,
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:26.840]  private property, a new renaissance becoming informed,
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:31.840]  not buying into the modern fake liberal culture of death
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:35.240]  that the Republican party is just another arm of.
[01:17:35.240 --> 01:17:36.360]  And we're gonna go to break and come back
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.280]  with this amazing professor
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:40.800]  that I saw on Stefan Malinus' show
[01:17:40.800 --> 01:17:42.040]  because I'm wanting to get a bunch of professors
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:42.880]  on of epigenetics.
[01:17:42.880 --> 01:17:44.320]  She's not a professor of that.
[01:17:44.320 --> 01:17:47.880]  She's a behavioral science and psychology,
[01:17:47.880 --> 01:17:49.680]  but it all ties in together.
[01:17:49.680 --> 01:17:51.840]  But just she was quantifying and getting
[01:17:51.840 --> 01:17:53.720]  into some of the important points of it.
[01:17:53.720 --> 01:17:56.360]  So I'm gonna get a bunch of people on
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:17:58.320]  that I heard her talk about
[01:17:58.320 --> 01:18:00.200]  because I've done research on this years ago,
[01:18:00.200 --> 01:18:02.120]  but more and more the field is really
[01:18:02.120 --> 01:18:03.600]  describing what's happening.
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:04.880]  So we're gonna go to her.
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:07.080]  If you wanna hold, because I wanna talk to you
[01:18:07.080 --> 01:18:10.200]  after she's gone, I believe that's Hollis
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:13.640]  and then Renelle, Chris and Chris,
[01:18:13.640 --> 01:18:16.400]  we will get to all of you after she leaves us.
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:20.360]  And then Dr. Edward Group is going to be here in studio
[01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:22.760]  to talk about what the cell phones are doing.
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:25.680]  See, I don't care who you are, what color you are,
[01:18:25.680 --> 01:18:28.840]  the cell phones are killing us dead or in a hammer.
[01:18:28.840 --> 01:18:30.280]  It's kind of like the Gardasil shots
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:32.480]  in their own trials eight years ago
[01:18:32.480 --> 01:18:35.320]  where sterilizing people, giving them autoimmune diseases
[01:18:35.320 --> 01:18:36.240]  and killing some.
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:38.760]  Now they're making it mandatory
[01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:41.000]  for all little girls in Mexico.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:42.200]  You're not gonna hear it in La Raza,
[01:18:42.200 --> 01:18:45.320]  that means the race by the way, very racist group,
[01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.320]  warning his Spanish not to take the shot.
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:48.840]  They're just gonna talk about how gringos
[01:18:48.840 --> 01:18:49.960]  are racist all day.
[01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:52.800]  See how the real social engineers
[01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:55.480]  have to act like they're fighting racism
[01:18:55.480 --> 01:18:56.320]  because in the truth,
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:59.360]  they're selling the cultural engineering and control
[01:18:59.360 --> 01:19:01.760]  that's meant to play us all off against each other.
[01:19:03.080 --> 01:19:04.280]  We're gonna go to break.
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:05.560]  When we come back, we're gonna go to the professor
[01:19:05.560 --> 01:19:07.160]  who I really appreciate joining us briefly.
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:09.560]  Remember, this is a list of supported transmission.
[01:19:09.560 --> 01:19:12.040]  We have sold out over and over again of the nation,
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:14.760]  iodine, proprietary, so good for your glands
[01:19:14.760 --> 01:19:17.600]  and so much for me, energy-wise, weight loss-wise,
[01:19:17.600 --> 01:19:21.200]  skin-health-wise, it's been $29.95.
[01:19:21.200 --> 01:19:22.600]  That's half the price leading competitor
[01:19:22.600 --> 01:19:24.800]  of this proprietary iodine.
[01:19:24.800 --> 01:19:27.080]  I'm taking $5 off because we ordered
[01:19:27.080 --> 01:19:28.520]  such a mass quantity of it.
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:30.840]  We do finally have a glut of it,
[01:19:30.840 --> 01:19:33.040]  but we're only gonna run this for a couple weeks.
[01:19:33.040 --> 01:19:35.400]  It's $5 off, $24.95.
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:37.560]  Survival Shield, Nation Iodine,
[01:19:37.560 --> 01:19:39.680]  a great way to stock up on it
[01:19:39.680 --> 01:19:41.040]  and it supports the broadcast.
[01:19:41.040 --> 01:19:43.840]  Check out the other amazing supplements

[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:54.800]  by the Chiapas Rebels, basically.

[01:20:14.800 --> 01:20:17.000]  by freeze drying your own fruits, meats,
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:18.880]  vegetables, even complete meals
[01:20:18.880 --> 01:20:21.240]  with the harvest right in-home freeze dryer.
[01:20:21.240 --> 01:20:24.120]  Imagine the savings and the peace of mind.

[01:22:04.520 --> 01:22:06.360]  about a potential for hood situation?
[01:22:06.360 --> 01:22:08.880]  The police are shoving people, shoving Alex,
[01:22:08.880 --> 01:22:09.720]  shoving the crowd.
[01:22:09.720 --> 01:22:10.560]  Here we go, folks.
[01:22:10.560 --> 01:22:11.400]  I'm Peter Sodja.

[01:22:15.440 --> 01:22:17.680]  In Fall Wars is the tip of the spear.
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:19.520]  Is this another false-flight stage attack
[01:22:19.520 --> 01:22:21.920]  to take our civil liberties and promote homeland security,
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:23.720]  or sticking our hands down on the streets?
[01:22:23.720 --> 01:22:25.760]  It's up to us to set brush fires
[01:22:25.760 --> 01:22:27.640]  in the minds of men and women everywhere.

[01:22:30.760 --> 01:22:34.960]  You watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:39.000]  of using chemical weapons against the so-called rebels.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.040]  What we see now is a war against reality.
[01:22:41.040 --> 01:22:42.440]  It's a war against the truth.

[01:23:29.560 --> 01:23:32.000]  than gold in a crisis.

[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:22.880]  You can check her out at www.nd.edu.com.
[01:24:22.880 --> 01:24:26.320]  I guess tilde, d, Narvaes,
[01:24:26.320 --> 01:24:32.160]  And we really appreciate her coming on with us because I I watched an hour-long program
[01:24:32.320 --> 01:24:34.840]  She was on over the weekend on
[01:24:35.880 --> 01:24:38.080]  Stefan Malinus TV show up in Canada
[01:24:39.120 --> 01:24:42.200]  She's with us throughout the hour that I promise if you guys hold I'll go to you
[01:24:42.200 --> 01:24:47.760]  But I wanted to get her on because she was talking about just child development and how children are not doing as well
[01:24:47.920 --> 01:24:51.320]  In Western society as they were in the past. I mean every metric shows that
[01:24:51.320 --> 01:24:57.200]  But she was also getting into epigenetics, which she's not a professor of but she studied
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:59.200]  I'm gonna get a bunch of professors of it on
[01:24:59.520 --> 01:25:01.520]  because I
[01:25:01.520 --> 01:25:07.840]  Personally, you know have had experiences growing. I put him on a column of what I would call hyper instincts
[01:25:08.680 --> 01:25:11.760]  And I was like a almost like an old man when I was a kid in ways
[01:25:12.120 --> 01:25:13.920]  But so are
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:18.960]  Young girls other young boys. I have two daughters and they'll just out of the blue even though we're a little bit
[01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:22.160]  They just say incredibly profound things. I know they've never heard before
[01:25:22.720 --> 01:25:24.320]  So what is that?
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:27.080]  Well, it's the innate programming of humans folks
[01:25:27.080 --> 01:25:33.480]  We are all our ancestors and they've proven the DNA is basically a record of things and it just gets deeper and deeper
[01:25:33.480 --> 01:25:38.160]  But this is a short segment long segment coming up. I'm giving you my layman view of it
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:41.840]  But I think this is the key to understanding so much. She joins us
[01:25:42.480 --> 01:25:46.880]  Today and I appreciate her coming on and we'll go over her bio more in the next segment
[01:25:46.880 --> 01:25:54.360]  But how would you quantify what's happening to the youth and how that ties into epigenetics?
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:26:00.120]  Well, could you talk with you Alex? Good to have you. Thanks for having me on I
[01:26:01.640 --> 01:26:03.640]  See that we have been
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:10.240]  Miss developing or miss raising kids for some time now and that affects their own
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:18.240]  Expression of genes they inherit their DNA, but it also then affects the subsequent generations
[01:26:18.240 --> 01:26:21.560]  We know that their epigenetic inheritance affects now
[01:26:21.560 --> 01:26:27.640]  So that if your grandparents went through a famine when either your your mother is an egg or your
[01:26:28.600 --> 01:26:35.520]  This firm of the the grandfather was affected then you're going to be affected as a grandchild your health for example
[01:26:35.520 --> 01:26:41.640]  And I what I'm doing is I'm expanding and pulling together information about how that affects our social
[01:26:42.120 --> 01:26:44.120]  capacities and our moral capacities
[01:26:47.200 --> 01:26:49.200]  The describe her folks
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:52.320]  More the definition of epigenetics
[01:26:53.360 --> 01:26:56.280]  Epigenetics well, it's kind of a little the broad
[01:26:56.280 --> 01:27:04.880]  Good understanding of it is how as you are growing there are sensitive periods for genes to be
[01:27:05.400 --> 01:27:13.120]  Turned on or off is the easy way to say it or expressed is more formal way to say it so that you might have a gene
[01:27:13.120 --> 01:27:18.800]  for example, they've done studies on a family in Europe where they have a particular M
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:28.800]  a o a gene that is linked to aggression and they find that the family members are tend to be more aggressive and
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:33.200]  They have the ones who have certain variations of the gene
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:37.800]  But it turns out that that's not enough. It's not enough just to have the gene
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:44.920]  You have to have an environment of abuse that actually makes that gene get expressed in a particular way or leads to aggressive behavior
[01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:49.360]  Well, exactly. Here's an example. I started getting beat up a lot when I was 10 or 11 years old
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:54.440]  I was the sweetest kid ever, but then I turned into a just absolutely vicious person
[01:27:54.440 --> 01:27:59.800]  I mean, I'm nice today, but it it developed and expressed, you know barbarian
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:02.880]  type traits
[01:28:03.240 --> 01:28:10.160]  Right and so there's different sensitive periods for genes to be expressed in a more or less permanent way and
[01:28:10.160 --> 01:28:14.800]  The first few years of life are one of those time periods early adolescence is another
[01:28:15.320 --> 01:28:22.120]  So those experiences you have at that time of support for what you need or not are going to
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:25.960]  Influence how your genes are functioning essentially
[01:28:26.400 --> 01:28:30.640]  Some people say really genes don't really matter much. It's all epigenetics
[01:28:30.840 --> 01:28:35.960]  So genes are just a blueprint and they they're innate there. I'm sorry there
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:43.560]  Inanimate they don't function unless experience turns them on or off. They're basically like switches
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:49.160]  Well, it's a blueprint and you got the environment is the switch. Oh
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:55.920]  Oh, I see so it's the blueprint and then the environment is the switch. I get it, right? Wow
[01:28:56.400 --> 01:28:59.800]  and of course the establishment has known this for a long time and
[01:28:59.800 --> 01:29:05.960]  I think that's why it's important for the public to understand this because if I look at the social engineering going on
[01:29:06.560 --> 01:29:10.240]  They are clearly trying to make people be like jellyfish or something
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:13.640]  Yeah, well when you undermine babies needs
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:17.160]  Which I argue about and write about a lot in study
[01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:20.400]  You are developing a person that's stress reactive
[01:29:20.400 --> 01:29:26.640]  So there what happens is the the part of the brain the more executive functions aren't established
[01:29:26.640 --> 01:29:30.440]  Well to control those fear or anger reactions
[01:29:31.240 --> 01:29:37.400]  Because that has to happen in those first years of life those were in the switches are being formed from experience of care
[01:29:37.400 --> 01:29:44.120]  And when they're not established well, then you end up with a person that easily gets stressed out and very profound
[01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:49.200]  Stay there. I want to give you the floor when we come back to talk about the young leave such an expert at Wow
[01:29:49.680 --> 01:29:52.880]  We're on the March the Empire's on the run

[01:30:18.360 --> 01:30:24.440]  Is this another false-flight stage attack to take our civil liberties and promote Homeland Security are sticking the hands down against on the streets
[01:30:24.440 --> 01:30:28.320]  It's up to us to set brush fires in the minds of men and women everywhere
[01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:36.360]  And that's what prison planet TV is designed to do you watch the Assad regime is going to be blamed or accused of using

[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:12.680]  300,000 people in West Virginia had their drinking water contaminate. What are the health effects of having these drugs and our drinking water?
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:19.000]  It's forced medical treatment without the consent of residents. My friends water filtration is one of the most basic actions

[01:33:22.680 --> 01:33:25.280]  It's Alex Jones
[01:33:25.280 --> 01:33:37.320]  Professor Darsha Narvize is our guest and she is a prominent behavioral psychologist at the University of Notre Dame
[01:33:37.320 --> 01:33:47.280]  Notre Dame and she has developed several theories adaptive ethical
[01:33:47.280 --> 01:34:02.280]  Well, we're gonna go over all of her theories with her so that I don't butcher them here but she deals with basically neurobiology clinical development education sciences in her develop projects and research about moral development
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:16.280]  I don't need to be a rocket scientist to know that if people don't hold their babies and take them places with them and teach them how to cook and teach them how to sweep and teach them how to fish and teach them how to hunt and teach them how to communicate and
[01:34:16.280 --> 01:34:26.280]  teach them how to be charming and teach them how to sew and teach them how to play football that people don't develop there's less language now
[01:34:26.280 --> 01:34:38.280]  I've seen the studies out about the different types of formula the brains don't develop they don't even weigh as much as our ancestors and then you look at the social engineers on record wanting a manageable population
[01:34:38.280 --> 01:34:50.280]  we're raised by television our bones are much smaller I've got a BBC article out dealing with that today just because we watch so much television and I'll show TV viewers that article in a moment
[01:34:50.280 --> 01:35:05.280]  here's one of the Daily Mail how modern humans have become weaklings compared with our ancient ancestors who could outrun and outlive today's top athletes just a regular person that they dug up out of a field in Cambridge England
[01:35:05.280 --> 01:35:17.280]  could just absolutely pull the arm out of the socket of the current Cambridge University students we are degenerating ladies and gentlemen and a lot of it's social engineering a lot of it's just the modern world but
[01:35:17.280 --> 01:35:25.280]  certainly the political classes have been accentuating this we've had a lot of white papers on air we've covered I'm not saying that's the professor's views we'll get her views
[01:35:25.280 --> 01:35:38.280]  but I'm going to give you the floor I'll just run wild with this but please professor when I watch you with the staff on Malanoo you broke down what the studies show with epigenetics not being triggered
[01:35:38.280 --> 01:35:54.280]  or the good genes not being triggered or the other genes being triggered the genes that are more associated with not being successful I guess to boil it down when we don't spend proper time with our babies and so you've got the floor to break this down for people
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:36:10.280]  okay thanks well we're studying right now the effects of parenting and the context of early life on early child development so we're looking at a set of practices that evolved 30 million years ago with the social mammals
[01:36:10.280 --> 01:36:28.280]  and that humans only intensified further because as we evolved to walk on two legs instead of four limbs our palaces had to shrink in order to enable that and so the babies had to be born a little more helpless and so we're born with only 25% of the brain in place
[01:36:28.280 --> 01:36:42.280]  and most of that grows in the first five years of life doesn't finish till the third decade like age 25 some people say 35 now so that's all the good thinking and planning and foresight stuff but in those first years then
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:37:00.280]  babies are born according when we compare to other animals 9 to 18 months early which means those not months really babies should be treated almost like they're still in the womb so you want to keep them not getting distressed because during that time the stress response systems of various kinds are being established
[01:37:00.280 --> 01:37:16.280]  and if you distress the baby frequently those the thresholds in the kind of set points for those systems are going to be at a very hyperactive state which means what happens when the stress response kicks in is that it draws blood away from your
[01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:34.280]  higher order thinking skills away from your orientation to other people your compassion and mobilizes you for action either to fight to run away or to just freeze if you can't do those things or even faint away so it gets makes you very self focused and you get personally distressed easily
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:50.280]  so we're looking at the parenting practices and how they affect then that brain development and when you don't get touched like you're saying pretty much constantly in the first year of life that's when all the stuff is being established to be good and it work well
[01:37:50.280 --> 01:38:10.280]  then you can actually develop a more hyperactive reaction to life and new situations we know from the rat studies at Michael Meany and his lab has done and might get him on but they've done a study for 20 years and they show that if you have a high nurturing rat mother in the first 10 days of life
[01:38:10.280 --> 01:38:28.280]  it turns on hundreds of genes perhaps thousands of genes by her care and they focus in on one in particular and they find that if you have a low nurturing mother during that time that means you're not getting licked if you're a rat but if you're a human it would be held
[01:38:28.280 --> 01:38:37.280]  and if you don't have a high nurturing mother at that time those genes never get turned on properly so for the rest of your life you're going to be anxious with new things
[01:38:37.280 --> 01:38:55.280]  so these genes need touch to be turned on to control anxiety if you don't get that you're going to be an anxious rat but they've also been transferred this to looking at the same processes the neurobiological processes in humans and find similar things happening
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:39:10.280]  so that's just touch and then there's breast milk you mentioned that breast milk has thousands of ingredients and it builds a good brain with a lot of serotonin receptors so which are linked to not getting depressed it has all the things you need to build your immune system
[01:39:10.280 --> 01:39:25.280]  and so in our what we do is we use some jumping around a little bit but I'm going to tell you about these practices and the way we know that humans that have actually followed these practices as we looked at anthropology research
[01:39:25.280 --> 01:39:42.280]  there's small than hunter-gatherers these are little societies of nomadic foragers they have no possessions essentially and they migrate to food areas they really represent 99% of human history were in these kinds of societies
[01:39:42.280 --> 01:39:55.280]  and in those societies they do these parenting practices that I'm going to tell you about and turns out they're really kind of smart and intelligent and more perceptive they see better hear better it's just kind of amazing
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:40:06.280]  and they have much more peaceful personalities as well they don't get so easily distressed or when you do that you probably perish out there in the forest or jungle you couldn't control yourself
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:20.280]  so what are these practices so these practices that we see in these small than hunter-gatherers are the ones that we're examining in our my laboratory and we're finding they're related to child development their intelligence their empathy their conscience their self-regulation
[01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:36.280]  whether they're depressed or aggressive they're all related to these practices so they are touch as I mentioned pretty constantly and available hugging affection in early life responsiveness to the needs of the baby so you don't let them cry
[01:40:36.280 --> 01:40:50.280]  crying babies are killing synapses it's undermining developments touches another one that I should just say that when a baby's not touched they will be they will stop growing
[01:40:50.280 --> 01:41:02.280]  you can see this in severe neglect cases but it means the DNA synthesis starts to slow down so if you want a nice healthy baby you've got to carry them around until they want to walk around themselves
[01:41:02.280 --> 01:41:16.280]  and then we have free play so babies are ready to play from birth you can see this in videos that call them to varthen is as captured they're ready to communicate back and forth and they want to spend their life doing that
[01:41:16.280 --> 01:41:34.280]  so that builds the brain it builds a very smart intelligent socially skilled person multiple adult caregivers babies need lots of care this is not enough one person is not enough one mom one dad and mom two people not enough you need the village
[01:41:34.280 --> 01:41:52.280]  we've kind of undermined that in our society at the moment also soothing perinatal experiences so no separating them on baby at birth no inducement of pain that is remembered in the brain the baby's first impressions of life are going to be forever stamped
[01:41:52.280 --> 01:42:00.280]  and then correct me if I'm wrong and then access all of the racial memories of pain and starts putting them on that path
[01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:14.280]  right so they get more self protected so what happens is the brain sort of shuts itself down it starts to filter life according to those threatening things and that's what makes you less intelligent it makes you less flexible it makes you less
[01:42:14.280 --> 01:42:19.280]  and then you can be in a nanny state that programs you with the fake fears it puts out
[01:42:19.280 --> 01:42:21.280]  you're more susceptible to all that
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:37.280]  well please continue amazing please continue right so what happens is you build a you kind of when your parents or your caregivers don't attend to you as the baby you know and say hi you know and interact with you you kind of learn and they send you off to your crib by yourself
[01:42:37.280 --> 01:42:51.280]  pride out you learn that you know the world is not a safe place so you're going to just trust everything that's sort of basic in your personality and you're also going to learn that you know you don't get much pleasure from being with other people so you're going to do your own thing
[01:42:51.280 --> 01:42:58.280]  which you know can also sometimes that's okay but sometimes it's very destructive people you know very detached from the nation
[01:42:58.280 --> 01:43:17.280]  sure bottom line what you break down in your writings is as I've read some of them now and you see it as common sense is prima facie what you're saying that people are not talking as much their IQs are going down the vocabulary is going down we're not as healthy we're more stressed out this modern system is basically
[01:43:17.280 --> 01:43:18.280]  killing us
[01:43:18.280 --> 01:43:35.280]  right and let me clarify in the IQ thing IQ scores over the 20th century in the USA went up and when you and that's called the Flynn effect and Flynn wrote a book about this in 2007 and he says well let's look at that what is it that changed over time
[01:43:35.280 --> 01:43:54.280]  what did people get better at it's answering hypothetical questions scientific kind of thinking detached from your you know what's going on now detached from your emotions so we've been increasing that kind of IQ while emotional IQ the ability to be flexible and socially responsive
[01:43:54.280 --> 01:44:04.280]  in the moment has been plummeting and so you can see now I see in my students they preferred text rather than the face to face you know I contact back and forth stuff
[01:44:04.280 --> 01:44:22.280]  people said at tables and text each other now yeah I know it's crazy so yeah IQ so I think we're getting less intelligent in comparison to our small band hunter gatherers though that the stories you know Jared Diamond has written a book about what we can learn from
[01:44:22.280 --> 01:44:37.280]  ancient societies and one of his earlier books he said you know that he thought the Papua New Guineans who he studied extensively we're much smarter than we were but they didn't have all the social supports to keep people alive we're not that smart
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:53.280]  sure sure well I haven't quantified this well any type of scientific way I can just kind of generally look at a lot of the different research trains of thought and compare them to what I see is just a person who's gone to the college of hard knocks on the streets and just business in the world
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:45:11.280]  but if you look at Carl Jung and art types and all that well those are basically stamped on us genetically that's why they do have that power and then you take it to the next level of epigenetics when you look at ancient rituals and things that are rights of passage for men and women
[01:45:11.280 --> 01:45:26.280]  that when you do those rights of passage it's like areas of your brain turned on and my whole life it was like wow for whatever reason this ritual I was just part of or this archetype I didn't even know those terms when I was younger it was like suddenly a world would open up to me
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:43.280]  and it was like doorways or chapters in a book you go through in your development in your hierarchy of development and then I see other people never really going into their hierarchy of development as you said just scientifically studying one business one area getting really good at that
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:52.280]  not having general knowledge until it's almost like they're biological androids that are programmed by the system and aren't even real do you see what I'm saying professor
[01:45:52.280 --> 01:46:10.280]  yeah I think one of the things we're undermining by not caring for babies and the way they're intended to be cared for is in receptive intelligence so if you look at indigenous folks traditional societies they're much more tuned into communications from the natural world
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:25.280]  but in the West the natural world we've decided is dead and we're the only people that are alive only humans are alive and they and so we don't hear the water we don't hear the trees I know it sounds a little wacky to us right but this is worldwide traditional
[01:46:25.280 --> 01:46:40.280]  societies they have much more awareness of how the whole earth is sort of communicating and we've lost that and we think you know that it's just us that matter and that human superiority thing over so I'm pushing the envelope here and being bold
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:53.280]  the human superiority idea is really what's leading to our crisis I think and sustainability we're destroying the earth because we don't think that matters it's just us right we're going to figure it out and we're cool and we're smart but we're not getting very smart anymore
[01:46:53.280 --> 01:47:05.280]  we don't realize we're killing ourselves while we're killing the earth and then there's also then fake environmental movements that siphon off all the real concern quantify this then for epigenics it's been proven as you said there's all these studies
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:24.280]  but how deep does it really go is this where people get the idea of reincarnation not that we're really being reincarnated but they just feel like they've been here before because we're living in a civilization like a coral reef built by our ancestors and there's archetypal relics of them societal cultural
[01:47:24.280 --> 01:47:32.280]  bones all around us and that it actually triggers in us in our genetics racial memories I mean how deep does it go
[01:47:32.280 --> 01:47:44.280]  yeah you know I can't speak to that but I could tell you a little bit more about the indigenous world view and one striking book you might have Dan Everett on he wrote a book called don't sleep there are snakes
[01:47:44.280 --> 01:48:04.280]  that's what people in the paraha society say to each other at night when they go to bed and he was missionary there for 23 years and wrote their language down and then translated the book of mark and he had one of them record into a tape recorder at the time
[01:48:04.280 --> 01:48:18.280]  the book of mark and had a group of them listen and at the end of listening to the book of mark they said do you know this Jesus and he said no well then why should we believe anything he says because they only believe in eyewitnesses
[01:48:18.280 --> 01:48:36.280]  so they don't do this hypothetical thinking thing if you ask him you know what should heights do this save the life of his wife they'll say who's nice I don't know I'm so they they don't trust this hypothetical stuff but then he said well but Jesus reading the book of mark
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:49.280]  really helped me because my mother committed suicide when I was an adolescent and they said suicide what's that and then when they when he told them they said they laughed
[01:48:49.280 --> 01:49:07.280]  well talk about a cliffhanger her Skype just cut out right as she said that and again ladies and gentlemen if you don't believe in evolution all that I'm not getting into that we know the issue is these these these genetic memories are there the globalists are aware of this they're programming and they're programming them to make us weak and
[01:49:07.280 --> 01:49:23.280]  in fearful and in stupid and so I'm saying that's what we have to get back to original cultures that's what the globalist want to overwrite synthetically all original culture I don't care what your culture is it's better than the new world orders culture
[01:49:23.280 --> 01:49:38.280]  and so for me it's important to get back to primitive ideas and primitive cultures because that is the originator of humans to basically be able to then understand what's happening currently because we're losing our humanities what I'm saying we're losing it
[01:49:38.280 --> 01:49:42.280]  we've got to rediscover it you got cut off there when
[01:49:42.280 --> 01:49:48.280]  when when they were saying suicide what's that and and then they laughed and said
[01:49:48.280 --> 01:49:53.280]  yeah sorry so they laughed and thought that was the craziest thing and they'd ever heard of
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:56.280]  you still hear me yes ma'am okay
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:50:10.280]  because for them life is a matter of death and transformation you're always when you die you're going to be part of the tree or the mountain or it's all life there's no other place to go there's no heaven or hell they don't have any conception of that
[01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:31.280]  so you're part of the world and this is Mother Earth or Gaia or the Great Spirit and you don't have to worry about going anywhere so to or leaving it's just here now and they were so happy he decided that he had nothing to teach them and he actually lost his faith and then became a linguist a professor
[01:50:31.280 --> 01:50:43.280]  well well regardless the point is that they are incredibly comfortable in their skin they've not been made modern and totally uncomfortable so scientifically what's the difference between those people and what we've become today
[01:50:43.280 --> 01:50:52.280]  because I believe looking back at what humans were previously is the answer of how to not lose our humanity now I want to come back in a final segment obviously have you back soon with the professor
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:58.280]  regardless folks of what you think about what she's saying the epigenetics is a key thing what is it really
[01:50:58.280 --> 01:51:01.280]  we'll be right back

[01:53:59.280 --> 01:54:19.280]  we're going to finish up with Professor Darsha Narvize here in just a moment very intriguing put her website on screen as well for folks but what we know bottom line is this
[01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:33.280]  we're not taking care of kids you heard her she said you know two parents there that's what it's designed to do on attacking single parent families or anybody the point is is that we're losing our humanity and across the board people
[01:54:33.280 --> 01:54:44.280]  children don't know how to cook they don't know how to do anything I mean I mean my grandfather's could fix anything my dad can fix a lot of stuff I can fix hardly anything myself and my dad was a good dad compared to most
[01:54:44.280 --> 01:54:58.280]  we are becoming children of the matrix is how I would describe it so I wanted to let her have final comments on that and people can learn more on her website that will put up on screen and also give out on air on the radio but
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:15.280]  we know this warehousing the kids feeding them all the GMO it's having just disastrous effects I mean I talked to people's children now on average and I'm not bragging about my children it's just that a lot of them are really obviously look unhealthy
[01:55:15.280 --> 01:55:23.280]  and are showing signs of all sorts of disorders and we see those on the increase bottom line what's happening professor
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:38.280]  I think we are baselines for what we think is normal has shifted we think the way we're caring for kids is normal this is a thing that happens all over and in scholarship and human life we think whatever we were raised with is normal
[01:55:38.280 --> 01:55:53.280]  the animal studies show that if you have a low nurturing mother the daughter is even worse the next generation so I think we have a spiraling of worsening conditions for kids and we don't really realize that we because adults then have been raised not so well
[01:55:53.280 --> 01:56:09.280]  and so they're a little more numb they're a little more less perceptive and not paying attention really and we adults are very distracted themselves they're not really emotionally present so what happens when you don't raise babies well is you can't be in the present moment
[01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:25.280]  you're very preoccupied with the things you didn't get emotionally or cognitively and so it's really hard to just be in the moment and so in my book that's coming out this summer on the neurobiology of human morality I have a whole big long chapter about what to do if you didn't get raised well
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:44.280]  and there are many things so one is to learn to be in the present moment to meditate breathe deeply learn to be not self preoccupied and there's a bunch of things to do about that if you're a parent what you want to do is play get your kid out there playing outside as much as possible
[01:56:44.280 --> 01:56:56.280]  we have parents who are afraid to let their kids outside because they think they're going to get kidnapped and the crime rate is the same as 1970 so it's kind of craziness is the stress reactivity of the parents that's causing them them to
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:01.280]  it's like people not swimming in the ocean because of great whites when they kill five people a year
[01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:17.280]  yeah right so they get very hyper reactive so play with your kids let them go outside get them out there in the wilderness and enjoy and connect to nature that's how we're going to save nature or ourselves so you've got to feel connected to it
[01:57:17.280 --> 01:57:32.280]  you want to hold and touch and be affectionate sit on the sofa close together you're watching TV whatever it is get in your body get back in your body and you can help regrow yourself the right hemisphere grows all throughout life
[01:57:32.280 --> 01:57:48.280]  you can't let yourself get stress reactive because that keeps it from growing so you have to get ways of you know being silly or playful or dancing learning to dance or art that stuff grows your creative side which is going to make it easier for you to be the present
[01:57:48.280 --> 01:58:01.280]  moment with your kids and to be more connected and all right so I want to have you back out when the book comes out a promise will come on all right thank you thank you so much professor really powerful information
[01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:14.280]  and again it's just another perspective out there regardless our children are becoming like programmable zombies and we've got to reverse it somehow and it's just absolutely essential to run around and chase your kids around the house in the yard next
[01:58:14.280 --> 01:58:39.280]  to it I mean it's just essential just to have fun and I could do that to more myself I get so serious all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy please remember this hour was brought to you by mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex great non GMO storeable food great customer service super high quality a lot more at mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex mypatriotsupply.com forward slash Alex will be right back

[01:58:50.280 --> 01:59:10.280]  from the water table to our soils to the atmosphere itself our world is becoming more and more toxic each and every day but it's not just the air outside this toxic indoor air has been shown to have two to five times higher concentrations of pollutants than even outdoor air and most Americans spend 90% of their time inside using toxic chemicals
[01:59:10.280 --> 01:59:27.280]  in their homes there are more than 42 million smokers in the United States well over a thousand types of mold in mildew linked to numerous conditions and don't forget the fact that 6 million Americans live with pets they're allergic to as well when I began to research these statistics it was clear to me it was time to start cleansing
[01:59:27.280 --> 01:59:45.280]  my lungs in order to combat the toxic environment that we cannot escape but we can fight back against made with organic and wild cultivated herbs and manufactured in the USA the new info wars life lung cleanse is here in a convenient spray bottle that can be brought with you throughout any toxic environment now available exclusively

[02:00:31.280 --> 02:00:47.280]  well I apologize as always I end up taking calls one hour and they run out of time to have a guest on for an hour and then people are holding and then another guest coming up and I appreciate folks holding to give their perspective on this whole clippers thing and how it's being I think uses a distraction
[02:00:47.280 --> 02:00:53.280]  we've been taking some really interesting calls Hollis thanks for holding so long from Washington you're on the air go ahead
[02:00:53.280 --> 02:01:02.280]  how you doing Alex hollison Washington DC okay so you're in Washington DC okay as you said Washington thanks for calling
[02:01:02.280 --> 02:01:17.280]  thanks for having me on the show so first things first I wish you would just stop talking about that the basketball owner it's just a distraction because there's more important news that we could be talking about it's like a disjustice to me and all the rest of your
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:27.280]  fans and I'm a guy no no I hear you but I mean we have to talk about it how it is a distraction so people that aren't informed like you understand that there's a lot of people don't know that
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:42.280]  yeah it's almost like beating a dead horse and it's kind of just like it's old but what I wanted to talk about is um you had mentioned something about the 300 pound black women ruling over us a couple of months ago
[02:01:42.280 --> 02:01:55.280]  yes and um I was talking about like gone with the wind with the 300 pound black woman being the boss there and I'm saying that's an archetype that was promoted by the Romans where they would have the women
[02:01:55.280 --> 02:02:09.280]  it was mainly white women they would have the women inside the house and they would keep the men out in the fields and wouldn't let them read or write that was translated into French and I forget who wrote it was like one of those black professors
[02:02:09.280 --> 02:02:19.280]  I read an article I read a newspaper and I went and looked it up it was like 15 years ago was it Walter Williams I forget wrote a whole article about it but I don't remember exactly where
[02:02:19.280 --> 02:02:30.280]  well what I was going to say on that is that's pretty much what's going on today especially in DC where I live at you pretty much see these grown men walking around here with these two or 300 pound women
[02:02:30.280 --> 02:02:43.280]  but you know I'm getting section 8 and benefits and they're basically just look like they're the mothers of the men the men aren't even men no more they look like grown boys um handicapped can't do anything
[02:02:43.280 --> 02:02:53.280]  and um I kind of want to agree with you on that I mean you kind of hit the nail on the head with that one I kind of fell out my chair when I heard you say that
[02:02:53.280 --> 02:03:01.280]  well I learned it I think it was Walter Williams I don't remember it was it was Walter Williams or one of those famous black conservative professors
[02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:12.280]  I read an article about I went and looked it up and it was true and I'm like I didn't know all this and then it made perfect sense but it was a translation of a Caribbean sugarcane plantation owner
[02:03:12.280 --> 02:03:21.280]  on how to control the slaves that they translated from Latin from the Romans that was then translated into English for plantations in the south
[02:03:21.280 --> 02:03:26.280]  and somebody's got to find that and mail it to me or send it to me because I've searched again and I can't find it
[02:03:26.280 --> 02:03:36.280]  well it goes on every day as we speak and also cause the chemtrails I live here in DC and I mean you see chemtrails every day or every other day
[02:03:36.280 --> 02:03:47.280]  but you got the congress the senate the president and all kinds of diplomats here I mean how do they think they're going to avoid the chemtrails that's killing us that's going to kill them also
[02:03:47.280 --> 02:03:55.280]  well the answer is most of senators are minions that aren't even in on it that's how low level they are the national security state since 47 is operated with unlimited money in secret
[02:03:55.280 --> 02:04:09.280]  and the elites a lot of them say humanity's so evil and this project's so important we're going to go ahead and be hurt by it we don't care plus they believe they have advanced technologies to keelate all this stuff out
[02:04:09.280 --> 02:04:18.280]  in fact I'll ask Dr. Edward group that whose dad was an elite chemist and part of the elite I'm going to ask him what he thinks about your question when we come back alright
[02:04:18.280 --> 02:04:19.280]  yes sir
[02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:31.280]  thank you great points yeah if I could only find that article that I think was in the Chicago sun like a 99 and folks you know my memory's good but it gets foggy
[02:04:31.280 --> 02:04:37.280]  and I think it was Walter Williams it might have been somebody else
[02:04:37.280 --> 02:04:44.280]  the point is is that I read the whole article on air and then I went and researched some of it and found some of it and then I tried to find it again and I couldn't find it
[02:04:44.280 --> 02:04:52.280]  but listen I couldn't find the article where the illegals get bank accounts with no IDs and then CJ or actually Chris Jordan just found it
[02:04:52.280 --> 02:05:00.280]  so maybe maybe you can find it send it to show tips and info wars dot com I'll reread the article on air
[02:05:00.280 --> 02:05:11.280]  in the last 50 years iodine has been phased out of our staple foods and replaced with the halogen bromine a practice now banned in nations around the world
[02:05:11.280 --> 02:05:22.280]  guess what else is in the halogen family floor I ladies and gentlemen Alex Jones here in 1924 the federal government did the right thing and encouraged salt producers to add iodine
[02:05:22.280 --> 02:05:33.280]  it's the good halogen on the periodic table and the results are on record reports documented a 15 point IQ increase in areas that had previously been deficient in iodine
[02:05:33.280 --> 02:05:42.280]  bottom line iodine is important unbound clean in a glycerin base nascent iodine was the answer for myself and my family

[02:06:00.280 --> 02:06:08.280]  the globalists have controlled the mainstream media for a long time but now they're expanding making the weaponization even more vicious and deceptive
[02:06:08.280 --> 02:06:17.280]  all the major networks are state runs we are partnering this year with the NFL the NFL has become a political weapon against the second amendment
[02:06:17.280 --> 02:06:25.280]  pushes Obamacare MSNBC tells us that our children belong to the state we have to break through our kind of private idea that kids belong to their parents
[02:06:25.280 --> 02:06:33.280]  or kids belong to their families and recognize that kids belong to whole communities it is more important than ever to realize that we are not the alternative media
[02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:41.280]  we are the true media the establishment dinosaur press is dying we are in an information war and we are losing that war

[02:07:10.280 --> 02:07:18.280]  for more than a decade my favorite coffee has come from the high mountains of southern Mexico where the Chiapas farmers grow their unique shade grown Arabica beans
[02:07:18.280 --> 02:07:23.280]  we have now managed to secure the sought after beans in a highly customized blend
[02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:30.280]  discover and try a bag of the patriot blend 100% organic coffee at info wars life dot com
[02:07:30.280 --> 02:07:37.280]  this coffee gives you a long smooth pick me up for hours without the headaches and heartburn that so many other coffees give me personally
[02:07:37.280 --> 02:07:44.280]  hands down this is my favorite coffee and it's taken us years to secure connections directly to the Chiapas Mexican farmers
[02:07:44.280 --> 02:07:52.280]  dropped by the site today order a bag or two and I don't think you're going to be disappointed available in original or with our immune support infusion blend
[02:07:52.280 --> 02:08:02.280]  you'll be supporting a free press all the while enjoying a truly great tasting cup of my favorite coffee available at info wars life dot com
[02:08:23.280 --> 02:08:37.280]  ladies and gentlemen for the balance of the hour doctor ed group is our guest I know that we have renelled and Chris and Chris and Brian and Albert calling in
[02:08:37.280 --> 02:08:47.280]  we'll get to you coming up here it'll kind of mix topics together but also want to get your take on the whole clippers thing and how they're trying to use racial diversion
[02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:55.280]  to divide and conquer obviously while they're attacking all of us with this whole globalist takeover but I promise callers are going to get to you I appreciate you holding
[02:08:55.280 --> 02:09:04.280]  we just had guest schedule today and so I'm kind of meshing the two together but so much is happening I like to invite you here at least once a month
[02:09:04.280 --> 02:09:16.280]  I appreciate you coming up from south Texas to do it doctor ed group obviously from the global healing center dot com author researcher drug developer also supplement developer
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:24.280]  but I like him to wildcard me and just show whatever he wants to talk about so here it is personal surveillance
[02:09:24.280 --> 02:09:41.280]  RLF radio microwave metal braces transmit frequencies into head LTE stands for long term evolution all species can no longer produce and again I'm not getting into a Christian debate about evolution one way or the other
[02:09:41.280 --> 02:09:50.280]  I'm a Christian I believe in God they got modern preachers the last 150 years that create all these debates I don't believe mainline sciences version of the earth
[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:59.280]  that's all been disproven with the animals and everything we know species jump my point is cars evolved tyranny is evolving the Nazi party evolved into something horrible
[02:09:59.280 --> 02:10:09.280]  the government's evolving into something evil evolution just means changing okay so we know things change and so I'm not sure what all what all this is going to be about
[02:10:09.280 --> 02:10:16.280]  how it's all going to tie in but it's always very interesting to have a wildcard guest come in because I trust doctor grip to come in and talk about what he wants to
[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:30.280]  what is all this quantify here today like 6,000 studies on dangers of smart meter RF and EMF Wi-Fi and schools magnetic fields and measured in Mila how do you say that Mila
[02:10:30.280 --> 02:10:43.280]  Watts yes Mila Watts and it says 1 million watts and then for safety the EPA recommends you limit your magnetic field exposure to 0.5 mg to 2.5 mg
[02:10:43.280 --> 02:10:52.280]  but they admit this is all higher than that and then we have a big stack of mainline news admitting that the cell phones are getting his cancer and it's only intensifying
[02:10:52.280 --> 02:11:08.280]  people are running the rural communities now to get away from it what's happening doctor group what what all these terms you sent me stand for well those are just talking points but really in reality it's the global elite agenda to create an
[02:11:08.280 --> 02:11:23.280]  environment of electromagnetic frequencies I mean our body is an electrical system our bodies and antenna and when you combine all these microwave waves through smart meters through cell phones through many different methods
[02:11:23.280 --> 02:11:38.280]  the whole design which is really scary what you were talking about early is so that all species can no longer produce and that's what we're coming to because we produce 3,000 miles of DNA every single day and these frequencies that we're being bombarded with
[02:11:38.280 --> 02:11:53.280]  are changing and altering the DNA and it's causing sterility it's causing changes to the ovaries is causing changes to the test these and that's not they're telling us we have bad genetics but is that you know mainline professor just said the genetics everybody has those it's
[02:11:53.280 --> 02:12:06.280]  what flips the switches on we're all getting super sick and they're telling us our genes are bad because they're putting things in the environment that are flipping the switch when you put metals in the environment to and then you add electromagnetic frequencies
[02:12:06.280 --> 02:12:19.280]  to the radio frequencies or microwave frequencies then I shouldn't worry about that I should worry about fight my black people right because the global elite already has the solutions to all this they have special paint that they paint their walls with to reduce the
[02:12:19.280 --> 02:12:31.280]  frequencies coming in they have solutions they're building all these elite hotels for rich people that don't have Wi-Fi or they have retreats they run to yeah look at the underground facilities and how many of those have been built so I mean they have the solutions but they
[02:12:31.280 --> 02:12:46.280]  create a whole world where I'm not talking about humans even I'm talking about animals to I mean trees next to cell phone towers are dying I mean the cells are being Monsanto said I think 10 years ago or no it was 14 years ago now as I read it on air over and over again in
[02:12:46.280 --> 02:13:02.280]  the graphic they admitted yeah no we want to take over have everything GMO so you'll need us just have trees and grass nothing else will live they kill everything and then only their frank in life lives radiation proof plans probably by that time you know who knows what's going to happen
[02:13:02.280 --> 02:13:18.280]  but the fact of the matter is the new thing now I mean I know if you've talked about it and people are aware of it is the smart meter situation in the smart meter putting out over 190,000 pulses of you know radiation throughout your whole house and all the kids now that are getting
[02:13:18.280 --> 02:13:30.280]  sick and not only getting sick in the homes but and in the parents to for that matter and the but we shouldn't worry about that we should worry about men and women fighting with each other well it's all a diversion like you were saying you know the media is going to divert you over
[02:13:30.280 --> 02:13:42.280]  here so you think about this you know racial stuff or this you know little you know all these shootings or something here when the big picture is they're poisoning the food the air the water and now they're radiating you
[02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:56.280]  and so that is affecting the health and also with the smart meters you're talking about privacy issues I mean literally they they can with a smart meter they can see exactly what time you get up they can say
[02:13:56.280 --> 02:14:08.280]  they now say they can read keystrokes they can read everything and they can look inside your home with the smart meters and say oh he gets up in the middle of the night to go urinate and they sell that information to the insurance carrier and when you come down with
[02:14:08.280 --> 02:14:18.280]  prostate cancer and the insurance carrier says well according to our records you know you were getting up in the middle of the night you didn't go into your doctor to get checked out so you know we're not going to cover you anymore
[02:14:18.280 --> 02:14:36.280]  I mean basically every single thing that you're doing can be monitored by these smart meters that not only are putting high levels of radiation into your home but also used for security and so they can you know watch every single thing that you're doing all the time
[02:14:36.280 --> 02:14:47.280]  so I mean that's a pretty severe situation going on and that's why they're trying to push for all these smart appliances to I mean the smart meter well the smart meter dials into those and it's the main surveillance hub
[02:14:47.280 --> 02:14:53.280]  right and it's a threat to the house too because now you're having fires all over the country with people installing these smart meters
[02:14:53.280 --> 02:15:08.280]  I'm reading even to their credit a CNN article a few years ago on there where it admitted that we probably pulled the headline up that cell phone radiation quote rattles and breaks DNA and that's why the brain tumors are increasing
[02:15:08.280 --> 02:15:17.280]  it literally just breaks up your DNA then the mutation start explain to people you know what that means
[02:15:17.280 --> 02:15:28.280]  well there's been pictures and videos online of someone taking with a tree next to a smart meter and there's some aphids on a leaf and every time the smart meter pulses you can see the aphids actually shake
[02:15:28.280 --> 02:15:39.280]  so what happens is this microwave radiation is kind of the same stuff that your microwave oven cooks food in it's just not as strong and what it does is it can literally those pulses of a of electromagnetic
[02:15:39.280 --> 02:15:48.280]  or actually radio frequency or microwave energy go in and alter the DNA structure and it actually can break it and it can cause genetic mutations
[02:15:48.280 --> 02:16:02.280]  because a house runs on 60 hertz I mean that's what the general grid is set at but with the smart meter you're pumping in about 928 million hertz into a 60 hertz grid
[02:16:02.280 --> 02:16:15.280]  so it can cause headaches it can cause memory loss memory fatigue it can cause a thyroid disruption it can cause many many many bone muscle pain
[02:16:15.280 --> 02:16:26.280]  it can initiate cancer world health organization came out in 2011 and said that radio frequency microwave energy causes class classified it as a two carcinogen
[02:16:26.280 --> 02:16:37.280]  so I mean all of this on top of every single thing else that people are doing not eating healthy you know using VOCs in their house drinking the fluoridated tap water
[02:16:37.280 --> 02:16:49.280]  I mean it's a combination of things but when you're stuck into in a radio frequency grid and you can't get out of it all that's going to do is just initiate disease even more
[02:16:49.280 --> 02:17:00.280]  but I remember in the 90s there were literally because I have a reason is every day thousands of news articles hundreds a year mainline going no cell phones do cause brain cancer
[02:17:00.280 --> 02:17:07.280]  and then I've talked to brain surgeons they go no we're seeing a ton of them right on the side you hold the cell phone to all these rare brain tumors are off the charts
[02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:15.280]  I'll be sitting at dinner or wherever people are like yeah Bob's got brain cancer how's Bob always 40 I mean it is just epidemic
[02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:28.280]  right 60% increase in brain cancer since cell phones came out and if you read the fine print on an iPhone it actually says in article whatever in the agreement that you signed that it needs to be held 5 8 of an inch away from your head
[02:17:28.280 --> 02:17:37.280]  now children's skulls are a lot thinner so children are going to be affected you know exponentially worse than adults are especially being sensitive
[02:17:37.280 --> 02:17:46.280]  and that brings up a whole another subject which we're talking about all the Wi-Fi routers that are in all the public schools and all the children now that are being mislabeled
[02:17:46.280 --> 02:17:55.280]  see instead of the doctor saying let me look at your diet let me look at what you're exposed to in your environment to figure out what's causing your health problems
[02:17:55.280 --> 02:18:06.280]  what you go into your doctor and you come up with all these symptoms and then they put you they diagnose you with ADD they're not looking at oh yes you're hyper sensitive to microwave frequency
[02:18:06.280 --> 02:18:15.280]  you shouldn't be eating five candy bars a day you shouldn't be drinking Coca-Cola all day you're having sugar spikes you're having a hundred things and that's what I harp on
[02:18:15.280 --> 02:18:23.280]  there's a multi thousand percent increase in breast cancer last 50 years the US leads the world next to England they go to third world countries no one's getting breast cancer
[02:18:23.280 --> 02:18:31.280]  I mean literally just doesn't exist and there we got to find a cure no one asked why is it exploding why are the brain tumors exploding
[02:18:31.280 --> 02:18:39.280]  why is cancer and kids exploding more than 10,000% why there's no discussion it's like oh we're going to get a treatment for that no what's causing it
[02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:47.280]  exactly that's my whole point what's the root cause of disease that's the true doctor is going to find out what the root cause of that individual's disease is
[02:18:47.280 --> 02:18:54.280]  and then address it and you know like we used to do we used to go into the individual patient's house and say okay you need to throw out all this stuff
[02:18:54.280 --> 02:19:04.280]  look at these chemicals educate the patient on what all is causing disease these artificial dyes are causing this these MSG and all this other stuff are excitotoxins in your brain
[02:19:04.280 --> 02:19:15.280]  this stuff the artificial sweeteners are contributing to this you know here's your sleeping with your laptop on your lap at night you know you have chemicals toxic chemicals that you're cleaning with
[02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:24.280]  you know all these things are contributing to disease and it's very simple eliminate this stuff from your life or replace it with non-toxic stuff and then the disease goes away
[02:19:24.280 --> 02:19:34.280]  and your body can heal itself because we all have a self healing mechanism it's like breast cancer okay what's causing breast cancer too much estrogen not enough testosterone iodine deficiency
[02:19:34.280 --> 02:19:41.280]  and women wearing bras and putting their cell phones right in their bras oh yeah if you notice women put their cell phones on their bras
[02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:48.280]  and I see it all the time they walk around with their cell phone for those that don't know cell phones are always on sending data back and forth
[02:19:48.280 --> 02:19:54.280]  that's right and smart meters are too they say that smart meters only pulse a couple times a day but they're on all day long pulsing
[02:19:54.280 --> 02:20:01.280]  I mean they're relaying information to other smart meters and now they're talking about putting wifi you know stay there stay there
[02:20:01.280 --> 02:20:05.280]  clean water at home clean water at the office clean water on the go

[02:20:38.280 --> 02:20:47.280]  forcing taxes to serve us debt this capitalism or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army

[02:22:22.280 --> 02:22:26.280]  On average the county says it sprays with the glyphosate at least once a week
[02:22:26.280 --> 02:22:30.280]  Few filters cut out the glyphosates that is found in water supplies worldwide
[02:22:30.280 --> 02:22:40.280]  Remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, hydrofluorosalic acid, sodium hexafluorosilicate, chloride is intense in coffins and waters and breads and toothpaste
