[00:00.000 --> 00:12.080]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.080 --> 00:32.920]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:32.920 --> 00:37.800]  well this is set to be one of the most important broadcast we've ever done things
[00:37.800 --> 00:42.560]  removing a lot faster than even I thought they could Barack Obama came out last
[00:42.560 --> 00:47.640]  night gave a speech and if you really listen to what he said he called for the
[00:47.640 --> 00:52.720]  invasion of Libya and he says that behind the scenes for the last three
[00:52.720 --> 00:59.360]  days and that was last night that a international response is being prepared
[00:59.360 --> 01:04.240]  the Wall Street Journal the BBC are reporting that Gaddafi of course has
[01:04.240 --> 01:12.760]  nerve gas mustard gas scud missiles he's bought a lot of high-tech weapons
[01:12.760 --> 01:17.960]  from the British particularly there's a big scandal going on right now where the
[01:17.960 --> 01:21.320]  British Prime Minister of course travel with a bunch of arm dealers two days
[01:21.320 --> 01:26.080]  ago to Egypt to immediately start selling more weapons to them the British
[01:26.080 --> 01:31.280]  have been the biggest sellers to Gaddafi while Gaddafi supposedly blew up one of
[01:31.280 --> 01:39.360]  their airliners it's just crazy so here we are here we are on the verge of yet
[01:39.360 --> 01:43.400]  another country being invaded and that's exactly what I've been saying for a
[01:43.400 --> 01:48.200]  month as Egypt falls as they prepare to bring down Saudi Arabia as the global
[01:48.200 --> 01:56.000]  is prepared to bring down Yemen and Bahrain and even Jordan and all these
[01:56.000 --> 02:00.560]  other nations in many of them it's going to get violent there's reports at the
[02:00.560 --> 02:04.080]  West Bank is going to flare up missiles are being fired again Lebanon's going to
[02:04.080 --> 02:14.300]  flare up and the situation in Libya is off the charts hardcore right now off the
[02:14.300 --> 02:18.480]  charts hardcore I don't have to explain that to you know that we're gonna be
[02:18.480 --> 02:23.960]  playing we come back from break Obama's speech statement last night we're gonna
[02:23.960 --> 02:28.320]  be analyzing that we're gonna be covering this and other important news for
[02:28.320 --> 02:32.280]  the next two hours but ladies and gentlemen we do not want to get involved
[02:32.280 --> 02:42.000]  in Tripoli in the situation there in Libya Gaddafi is armed to the teeth let
[02:42.000 --> 02:45.360]  those people sort it out but we're already involved because the globalists
[02:45.360 --> 02:49.000]  that run our country are now on record it was even the Washington Post yesterday
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.120]  that the opposition group in Libya launching this is being financed out of
[02:54.120 --> 02:59.240]  Washington and we've had articles covering all that at info wars calm and
[02:59.240 --> 03:02.360]  prison planet calm does that mean the people don't have a legitimate reason
[03:02.360 --> 03:09.680]  not want to be under a creepy dictator no I mean I'm all for them having a
[03:09.680 --> 03:16.080]  revolution if they want to have it but the people running our nation five
[03:16.080 --> 03:19.880]  weeks ago sent L. Barry in to overthrow their puppet
[03:19.880 --> 03:25.080]  Hussein Mubarak now that's happened now the Muslim Brotherhood's taken over
[03:25.080 --> 03:30.880]  Gaddafi we're now hearing oh Al Qaeda is there he's now running Al Qaeda first
[03:30.880 --> 03:39.200]  Saddam runs Al Qaeda got to be invaded WMD's then it's in Pakistan before that
[03:39.200 --> 03:47.000]  the Al Qaeda was in Afghanistan now Al Qaeda is in Somalia then Al Qaeda is
[03:47.000 --> 03:51.200]  here there everywhere it's like a set piece on a chessboard they just move
[03:51.200 --> 03:54.760]  the Al Qaeda chess piece wherever they want to be able to strike and that
[03:54.760 --> 03:58.920]  allows them to move their pieces into the area I mean this is extremely
[03:58.920 --> 04:02.840]  elementary what we're dealing with here it's the great game divide and conquer
[04:02.840 --> 04:05.920]  but for the public who's not aware of it they're completely blind the general
[04:05.920 --> 04:11.040]  public has no idea all they know is Gaddafi bad man Gaddafi is reportedly we
[04:11.040 --> 04:15.560]  don't have any this is true British Intel has been of course previously ran
[04:15.560 --> 04:19.200]  Libya through their puppet king before Gaddafi came to power in the late 60s
[04:19.200 --> 04:25.320]  and they were the ones that said he'd fled to Venezuela and that was done to
[04:25.320 --> 04:29.800]  destabilize it further and emboldened the opposition and now they're saying
[04:29.800 --> 04:34.280]  he's been strafing and and bombing people with helicopters and jets may be
[04:34.280 --> 04:39.680]  true certainly not a good thing to do but what happens with the thousand plus
[04:39.680 --> 04:44.960]  drones in Afghanistan and Pakistan other areas killing whole wedding parties of
[04:44.960 --> 04:49.840]  hundreds of people supposedly to kill one bad guy oh that's okay the bomber
[04:49.840 --> 04:55.280]  strafe weddings and markets but oh and Gaddafi does it it's so horrible it's
[04:55.280 --> 04:59.000]  the hypocrisy ladies and gentlemen well they're right back Charlie sheen's

[07:00.040 --> 07:03.400]  Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power
[07:03.400 --> 07:07.360]  generator number one new climate legislation could easily double or
[07:07.360 --> 07:11.600]  triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control how
[07:11.600 --> 07:15.880]  much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government
[07:15.880 --> 07:20.240]  control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number
[07:20.240 --> 07:24.360]  three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[07:24.360 --> 07:28.880]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[07:28.880 --> 07:32.960]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[07:32.960 --> 07:36.720]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[07:36.720 --> 07:40.760]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[07:40.760 --> 07:43.480]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[07:43.480 --> 07:48.440]  science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more information at www dot my
[07:48.440 --> 07:52.160]  solar back up dot com that's my solar back up dot com remember the
[07:52.160 --> 07:56.240]  government doesn't own the son should go to my solar back up dot com or call 1
[07:56.240 --> 08:04.520]  877-327-0365 Genesis Communications Radio Network proudly presents the Alex
[08:04.520 --> 08:09.840]  Jones show because there's a war on for your mind
[08:18.480 --> 08:24.240]  well in case you missed it last night President Obama gave a speech here's the
[08:24.240 --> 08:29.200]  CNN headline Obama condemns Libyan violence calls for international
[08:29.200 --> 08:33.120]  response he said in the days previous to that that they were already behind the
[08:33.120 --> 08:39.200]  scenes preparing the international UN slash NATO response and that will be
[08:39.200 --> 08:45.440]  military that will be Marines from all of the NATO countries that will be armed
[08:45.440 --> 08:51.560]  forces Air Force going into Libya with a guy who for 40 plus years has been
[08:51.560 --> 08:57.880]  stockpiling giant amounts of nerve gas mustard gas scud missiles you name it
[08:57.880 --> 09:04.640]  Egypt's in striking distance Israel's in striking distance Italy I mean this
[09:04.640 --> 09:10.040]  this this is out of control this is crisis creation and what have we been
[09:10.040 --> 09:17.840]  saying that the globalist are going to do to basically destabilize the world as
[09:17.840 --> 09:21.840]  a smokescreen for the global depression that they've engineered they're going to
[09:21.840 --> 09:28.400]  start a war they have a playbook they do this over and over and over and over and
[09:28.400 --> 09:32.080]  over again we've been saying we don't know where it's going to start but
[09:32.080 --> 09:37.120]  probably the Middle East destabilization campaign that is going to then spread all
[09:37.120 --> 09:42.040]  over the region and it is on record in the Washington Post it is on record in
[09:42.040 --> 09:45.960]  the Associated Press they even admit that the main Libyan opposition leaders
[09:45.960 --> 09:51.080]  that triggered all of this are run out of Washington so yeah they've got to
[09:51.080 --> 09:56.240]  respond to the humanitarian disaster they have triggered again the people of
[09:56.240 --> 10:03.280]  Libya great rebels 1776 whatever self-determination I'm all for it against
[10:03.280 --> 10:08.040]  a brutal dictator but why would the globalist trigger this at this time not
[10:08.040 --> 10:11.280]  because they want to bring freedom to that region they want another war to
[10:11.280 --> 10:15.560]  pump hundreds of billions of dollars in another invasion another overthrow to
[10:15.560 --> 10:21.280]  ensure that the dominoes keep falling and then they're going to put extremist
[10:21.280 --> 10:27.440]  into power they're going to have groups all around and again by extremist I'm
[10:27.440 --> 10:31.000]  using the term that the establishment uses so the general public knows what
[10:31.000 --> 10:34.680]  I'm talking about anybody that doesn't want to be occupied they're gonna put
[10:34.680 --> 10:41.480]  those people in so they can then have a war with them and you heard it here from
[10:41.480 --> 10:46.960]  Webster Tarpley historian you heard it here from yours truly from Paul Watson
[10:46.960 --> 10:54.360]  from Aaron Dykes how do you think the tiny British Empire dominated more than
[10:54.360 --> 10:59.720]  half of the major countries in the world just 70 years ago they wrote
[10:59.720 --> 11:03.840]  manuals handbooks on how they play one country against another then take over
[11:03.840 --> 11:07.240]  that next country then play that country off against the next or they'd fund
[11:07.240 --> 11:11.760]  rebels in an area as a pretext to come in or to scare the neighboring country to
[11:11.760 --> 11:16.680]  then join with the British this is how this works this is how a little beady
[11:16.680 --> 11:21.240]  country was able to do it and then the French did it the Spanish did it the
[11:21.240 --> 11:25.920]  Portuguese did it as well nobody has ever done it as good as the British the
[11:25.920 --> 11:35.040]  British openly in 1900 1905 19 all those years leading up to 1914 the start of
[11:35.040 --> 11:39.560]  World War one openly said Germany's rising they're taking over the world
[11:39.560 --> 11:47.080]  via their advanced technologies in chemistry in in all the sciences it was
[11:47.080 --> 11:51.040]  called you the danger of the rising Germany and Britain openly said we've
[11:51.040 --> 11:54.480]  got to start a war with them now before it's too late or our global empire is
[11:54.480 --> 11:59.040]  gonna fail we've got a team up with America to do it but Americans don't
[11:59.040 --> 12:02.360]  want to be involved so British intelligence was publicly sent to the
[12:02.360 --> 12:10.200]  US to buy off politicians the Germans ran you know news headlines bought out
[12:10.200 --> 12:15.440]  full-page ads saying don't sell in the Lusitania it's a auxiliary ship carrying
[12:15.440 --> 12:21.320]  munitions from the US it's a military ship it's flagged military we're gonna
[12:21.320 --> 12:25.720]  sink it and they told them for two months and then when they did sink it
[12:25.720 --> 12:29.680]  they said oh my gosh remember the Lusitania we've got to have war but
[12:29.680 --> 12:34.480]  before that the British through the black hand this is all mainline history
[12:34.480 --> 12:39.600]  engineered the shooting of Franz Ferdinand the Archduke of the Austrian
[12:39.600 --> 12:45.480]  Hungarian Empire and it was on and of course the Germans were imperialist and
[12:45.480 --> 12:49.280]  wanted global domination as well it's not that they were good and the British
[12:49.280 --> 12:53.720]  were good or the British were bad the Germans were bad it's just what they
[12:53.720 --> 12:58.400]  were its empire it's how humans operate it's what the Chinese have tried to do
[12:58.400 --> 13:01.680]  thousands of years ago originally it's what the Japanese have tried over and
[13:01.680 --> 13:05.240]  over again it's what the Arabs have tried with each other it's what happened
[13:05.240 --> 13:12.000]  in Mesoamerica with different well the more ancient the Toltecs and others but
[13:12.000 --> 13:15.400]  then the Mayan culture developing and out of that the Aztecs and others and
[13:15.400 --> 13:20.560]  whoever was the most cunning warlike manipulative ended up taking over this
[13:20.560 --> 13:27.400]  is what empires do it's like a tropism what's a tropism a plant you plant the
[13:27.400 --> 13:34.120]  seed it gets sunlight heat water nutrients it sprouts it grows it turns
[13:34.120 --> 13:40.200]  towards the Sun it doesn't have a brain it's a wild thing that's pre-programmed
[13:40.200 --> 13:44.920]  and humans do the same thing over and over again that's why it said those that
[13:44.920 --> 13:50.480]  don't know history are doomed to repeat it that's why history is the key to the
[13:50.480 --> 13:56.800]  present and the future history history history history history history history
[13:56.800 --> 14:01.840]  history and they want the public to be mindless to be to be one-dimensional and
[14:01.840 --> 14:08.520]  to say Alex are you saying who's the Mubarak's good are you saying Muammar
[14:08.520 --> 14:16.520]  Gaddafi's good no I'm pointing out that Gaddafi eight years ago made a peace deal
[14:16.520 --> 14:22.000]  with the globalist look what happened to him that just allowed infiltration he
[14:22.000 --> 14:27.360]  did try to develop his country compared to some of the people over there his
[14:27.360 --> 14:30.400]  socialism actually did hand out some of the goodies because when you have an
[14:30.400 --> 14:35.120]  absolute dictator he doesn't care about you know a big government class that's
[14:35.120 --> 14:38.840]  feeding on people it was pretty streamlined but but very oppressive but
[14:38.840 --> 14:44.560]  he did develop Libya he did disperse a lot of the money still a horrible guy
[14:44.560 --> 14:53.200]  but compared to the globalist not one 100 as cunning and and move Muammar
[14:53.200 --> 14:56.320]  Gaddafi found out they were putting AIDS viruses in the vaccines through UN
[14:56.320 --> 15:01.400]  programs that was confirmed he wouldn't allow him to come in with abortion see
[15:01.400 --> 15:07.080]  he see these were his people his cattle and it kind of like I've known some
[15:07.080 --> 15:11.400]  farmers and ranchers that love their prized cows so much they won't even
[15:11.400 --> 15:15.880]  butcher them and they end up just you know having hundreds and hundreds and
[15:15.880 --> 15:19.080]  then have to finally sell some off because I mean I've known farmers and
[15:19.080 --> 15:23.320]  ranchers that go out and pet their cows my grandfather was that way he had
[15:23.320 --> 15:27.840]  certain cows he had for 10 15 years that were his friends and he just couldn't
[15:27.840 --> 15:32.880]  sell them and but side issue the point is it's kind of like that I don't like my
[15:32.880 --> 15:38.800]  grandpa liked his cows that's what you got with Muammar Gaddafi okay no you're
[15:38.800 --> 15:42.800]  not gonna poison my cows okay the globalists are like they're too many
[15:42.800 --> 15:51.240]  cows yes get rid of some China signed on 35 years ago 37 at 36 37 years ago to
[15:51.240 --> 15:59.560]  the UN population reduction program now I'm gonna go out to break with this clip
[15:59.560 --> 16:04.360]  of Obama last night I'm gonna come back and really try to walk through all of
[16:04.360 --> 16:09.160]  this but this is on record triggered by the same banks that have hijacked our
[16:09.160 --> 16:13.280]  country and hijacked Europe I don't want to say it's our government doing it but
[16:13.280 --> 16:16.920]  it's on record now the articles are posted in full wars.com and
[16:16.920 --> 16:22.320]  prisonplanet.com mainstream news bragging oh America no not America the
[16:22.320 --> 16:26.800]  globalists but they say America yes it's run out of DC the opposition group
[16:26.800 --> 16:33.720]  they're gonna put in and bring freedom to that region but then meanwhile the
[16:33.720 --> 16:36.040]  Muslim Brotherhood and all them are saying death to Gaddafi they're gonna
[16:36.040 --> 16:39.840]  set up a totally Islamic State and then the whole cycle will start over again
[16:39.840 --> 16:46.800]  and see now oh my gosh Gaddafi is strafing his own people we've got to
[16:46.800 --> 16:52.080]  invade meanwhile over a thousand drones every day on record the Pentagon has said
[16:52.080 --> 16:56.160]  they can kill 200 people if they're getting one person they want and that's
[16:56.160 --> 17:01.240]  good collateral damage that that is acceptable but then Gaddafi has in many
[17:01.240 --> 17:05.920]  cases armed CIA backed globalist intelligence operatives who know how to
[17:05.920 --> 17:12.000]  drive tanks who know how to use weapon systems trained attacking military
[17:12.000 --> 17:16.400]  bases and he comes in and strafes them if you can even believe that the media's
[17:16.400 --> 17:21.160]  lied so much saying that Gaddafi you know fled four days ago when he hadn't so
[17:21.160 --> 17:24.080]  let's go ahead and play part of the clip of Obama will come back and play the
[17:24.080 --> 17:32.000]  rest here it is here is Obama. Good afternoon everybody. Secretary Clinton and I just
[17:32.000 --> 17:36.800]  concluded a meeting that focused on the ongoing situation in Libya over the last
[17:36.800 --> 17:42.000]  few days my national security team has been working around the clock to monitor
[17:42.000 --> 17:46.560]  the situation there and to coordinate with our international partners about a
[17:46.560 --> 17:54.440]  way forward first we are doing everything we can to protect American citizens that
[17:54.440 --> 17:59.160]  is my highest priority in Libya we've urged our people to leave the country
[17:59.160 --> 18:05.160]  and the State Department is assisting those in need of support meanwhile I
[18:05.160 --> 18:09.280]  think all Americans should give thanks to the heroic work that's being done by
[18:09.280 --> 18:13.880]  our Foreign Service officers and the men and women serving in our embassies and
[18:13.880 --> 18:18.640]  consulates around the world they represent the very best of our country
[18:18.640 --> 18:24.760]  and its values throughout this period of unrest and upheaval across the region
[18:24.760 --> 18:29.880]  the United States has maintained a set of core principles which guide our
[18:29.880 --> 18:35.920]  approach these principles apply to the situation in Libya as I said last week
[18:35.920 --> 18:42.840]  we strongly condemn the use of violence in Libya the American people extend our
[18:42.840 --> 18:47.080]  deepest condolences to the families and loved ones of all who have been killed
[18:47.080 --> 18:52.840]  and injured the suffering and bloodshed is outrageous and it is
[18:52.840 --> 18:58.800]  unacceptable so are threats and orders to shoot peaceful protesters and further
[18:58.800 --> 19:03.920]  punish the people of Libya these actions violate international norms and
[19:03.920 --> 19:12.320]  every standard of common decency this violence must stop the United States
[19:12.320 --> 19:17.240]  also strongly supports the universal rights of the Libyan people that
[19:17.240 --> 19:21.520]  includes the rights of peaceful assembly free speech and the ability of the
[19:21.520 --> 19:27.440]  Libyan people to determine their own destiny these are human rights they are
[19:27.440 --> 19:32.720]  not negotiable they must be respected in every country and they cannot be
[19:32.720 --> 19:40.040]  denied through violence or suppression in a volatile situation like this one it
[19:40.040 --> 19:43.360]  is imperative that the nations and peoples of the world speak with one
[19:43.360 --> 19:48.640]  voice and that that has been our focus okay yesterday a unanimous you we're

[24:21.520 --> 24:23.520]  I am a Midwest farmer
[24:23.520 --> 24:25.520]  I make a living off the land

[24:30.520 --> 24:32.520]  the rain hasn't fallen
[24:32.520 --> 24:34.520]  since the middle of life
[24:34.520 --> 24:36.520]  we are back live ladies and gentlemen
[24:36.520 --> 24:39.520]  and you heard Obama they are preparing an international response
[24:39.520 --> 24:43.520]  and the press continues to report on it
[24:43.520 --> 24:45.520]  and the Wall Street Journal says
[24:45.520 --> 24:49.520]  U.S. fears triply may deploy gas as chaos mounts
[24:49.520 --> 24:54.520]  scud missiles they think he has nerve gas mustard gas he has a lot of other
[24:54.520 --> 24:57.520]  high-tech weapons and here are the globalist
[24:57.520 --> 25:01.520]  going into a political atmosphere a political climate
[25:01.520 --> 25:05.520]  where the people a lot of them do want to revolt against a dictator
[25:05.520 --> 25:11.520]  and they trigger it and now we're facing a desperate dictator with these weapons systems
[25:11.520 --> 25:14.520]  who's reportedly strafing his own people
[25:14.520 --> 25:18.520]  and then Obama is saying we must speak with one voice on this America
[25:18.520 --> 25:21.520]  that means don't say hey we don't want to invade
[25:21.520 --> 25:24.520]  let them you know let them have it out themselves
[25:24.520 --> 25:28.520]  but see the globalists through the west through NATO through America through
[25:28.520 --> 25:33.520]  England have triggered this entire thing
[25:33.520 --> 25:37.520]  they've gone into a hornet's nest and hit it with a baseball bat
[25:37.520 --> 25:42.520]  now are the hornets there are the hornets real are the hornets now causing a problem
[25:42.520 --> 25:45.520]  yes but who went up and hit the hornet's nest
[25:45.520 --> 25:49.520]  let's finish up with Obama telling us that we've all got to sit down and shut up
[25:49.520 --> 25:52.520]  that's what speak with one voice means he means do what I say here it is
[25:52.520 --> 25:58.520]  and every standard of common decency this violence must stop
[25:58.520 --> 26:04.520]  the United States also strongly supports the universal rights of the Libyan people
[26:04.520 --> 26:08.520]  that includes the rights of peaceful assembly free speech
[26:08.520 --> 26:12.520]  and the ability of the Libyan people to determine their own destiny
[26:12.520 --> 26:16.520]  these are human rights they are not negotiable
[26:16.520 --> 26:19.520]  they must be respected in every country
[26:19.520 --> 26:24.520]  and they cannot be denied through violence or suppression
[26:24.520 --> 26:27.520]  in a volatile situation like this one
[26:27.520 --> 26:32.520]  it is imperative that the nations and peoples of the world speak with one voice
[26:32.520 --> 26:34.520]  and that that has been our focus
[26:34.520 --> 26:38.520]  yesterday a unanimous UN Security Council sent a clear message
[26:38.520 --> 26:43.520]  that it condemns the violence in Libya, supports accountability for the perpetrators
[26:43.520 --> 26:46.520]  and stands with the Libyan people
[26:46.520 --> 26:50.520]  the same message by the way has been delivered by the European Union
[26:50.520 --> 26:55.520]  the Arab League, the African Union, the Organization of the Islamic Conference
[26:55.520 --> 26:59.520]  and many individual nations
[26:59.520 --> 27:05.520]  North and South, East and West voices are being raised together
[27:05.520 --> 27:11.520]  to oppose suppression and support the rights of the Libyan people
[27:11.520 --> 27:15.520]  I've also asked my administration to prepare the full range of options
[27:15.520 --> 27:18.520]  that we have to respond to this crisis
[27:18.520 --> 27:20.520]  this includes those actions we may take
[27:20.520 --> 27:24.520]  and those we will coordinate with our allies and partners
[27:24.520 --> 27:29.520]  or those that will carry out through multilateral institutions
[27:29.520 --> 27:35.520]  like all governments, the Libyan government has a responsibility to refrain from violence
[27:35.520 --> 27:38.520]  to allow humanitarian assistance to reach those in need
[27:38.520 --> 27:41.520]  and to respect the rights of its people
[27:41.520 --> 27:45.520]  it must be held accountable for its failure to meet those responsibilities
[27:45.520 --> 27:50.520]  and face the cost of continued violations of human rights
[27:50.520 --> 27:54.520]  this is not simply a concern of the United States
[27:54.520 --> 27:56.520]  the entire world is watching
[27:56.520 --> 28:00.520]  and we will coordinate our assistance and accountability measures
[28:00.520 --> 28:02.520]  with the international community
[28:02.520 --> 28:05.520]  to that end, Secretary Clinton and I have asked Bill Burns
[28:05.520 --> 28:08.520]  our Undersecretary of State for Political Affairs
[28:08.520 --> 28:11.520]  to make several stops in Europe and the region
[28:11.520 --> 28:14.520]  to intensify our consultations with allies and partners
[28:14.520 --> 28:16.520]  about the situation in Libya
[28:16.520 --> 28:19.520]  I've also asked Secretary Clinton to travel to Geneva on Monday
[28:19.520 --> 28:24.520]  where a number of foreign ministers will convene for a session of the Human Rights Council
[28:24.520 --> 28:29.520]  there shall hold consultations with their counterparts on events throughout the region
[28:29.520 --> 28:32.520]  and continue to ensure that we join with the international community
[28:32.520 --> 28:37.520]  to speak with one voice to the government and the people of Libya
[28:37.520 --> 28:42.520]  and even as we are focused on the urgent situation in Libya
[28:42.520 --> 28:47.520]  let me just say that our efforts continue to address the events taking place elsewhere
[28:47.520 --> 28:51.520]  including how the international community can most effectively support
[28:51.520 --> 28:56.520]  a useful transition to democracy in both Tunisia and in Egypt
[28:56.520 --> 29:02.520]  so let me be clear, the change that is taking place across the region
[29:02.520 --> 29:06.520]  is being driven by the people of the region
[29:06.520 --> 29:11.520]  this change doesn't represent the work of the United States or any foreign power
[29:11.520 --> 29:15.520]  it represents the aspirations of people who are seeking a better life
[29:15.520 --> 29:23.520]  OK, that's enough. It is on record that Google, George Soros, the CIA, the NSA, British Intelligence
[29:23.520 --> 29:30.520]  were all over the overthrow of Hosni Mubarak. That's not debated now. It's a fact.
[29:30.520 --> 29:35.520]  It is not debated that the major opposition forces triggering this in Tripoli
[29:35.520 --> 29:38.520]  and in and around Libya was run out of the west
[29:38.520 --> 29:42.520]  and he sat there and said this has nothing to do with foreign powers involved
[29:42.520 --> 29:45.520]  that is another lie from the liar-in-chief
[30:12.520 --> 30:18.520]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family
[30:18.520 --> 30:22.520]  not worried about them moving south
[30:22.520 --> 30:27.520]  closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow

[33:13.520 --> 33:19.520]  we're continuing to cover this earth changing information that's unfolding in Libya
[33:19.520 --> 33:25.520]  now that was a five minute clip we almost aired all of his short statement
[33:25.520 --> 33:28.520]  his five and a half minute statement last night
[33:28.520 --> 33:32.520]  President Barry Sataro aka Barack Obama
[33:32.520 --> 33:37.520]  and I want people to understand what they're openly saying
[33:37.520 --> 33:40.520]  they're talking about an invasion
[33:40.520 --> 33:45.520]  now remember what happened to US forces in Somalia
[33:45.520 --> 33:48.520]  chronicled the movie black hog down
[33:48.520 --> 33:51.520]  what do you think is going to happen
[33:51.520 --> 33:54.520]  I know it goes from bad to worse
[33:54.520 --> 33:59.520]  if an international force badly coordinated
[33:59.520 --> 34:01.520]  goes into Libya
[34:01.520 --> 34:07.520]  well they intend to basically stampede
[34:07.520 --> 34:11.520]  Gaddafi into fleeing or cause more of his forces to turn against him
[34:11.520 --> 34:16.520]  they know that if a big task force is now being prepared
[34:16.520 --> 34:19.520]  in the Mediterranean goes in there
[34:19.520 --> 34:22.520]  and you notice recently under the Egypt cover
[34:22.520 --> 34:25.520]  more US aircraft carriers came into the med
[34:25.520 --> 34:27.520]  so they're all just sitting there waiting
[34:27.520 --> 34:31.520]  now you see the grand chess board becoming crystal clear
[34:31.520 --> 34:34.520]  and now the invasion can begin
[34:34.520 --> 34:37.520]  and the globalists may just be testing to see if they threaten an invasion
[34:37.520 --> 34:40.520]  and lie and say that he's fled Libya
[34:40.520 --> 34:42.520]  that that will destabilize him further
[34:42.520 --> 34:45.520]  and give more power to the opposition to make sure he falls
[34:45.520 --> 34:47.520]  and come in to render humanitarian aid
[34:47.520 --> 34:50.520]  i.e. take over the entire infrastructure
[34:50.520 --> 34:53.520]  and the trillions of dollars of oil
[34:53.520 --> 34:56.520]  that are confirmed to be in Libya
[34:56.520 --> 35:03.520]  but there's a whole other facet to this
[35:03.520 --> 35:05.520]  that I mentioned earlier
[35:05.520 --> 35:10.520]  and that is dealing with the strafing
[35:10.520 --> 35:13.520]  and Kurt Nimmel wrote a story about this last night
[35:13.520 --> 35:16.520]  with great writers dealing with the fact
[35:16.520 --> 35:18.520]  that thousands and thousands of people a year
[35:18.520 --> 35:21.520]  are killed by the thousand plus drones
[35:21.520 --> 35:24.520]  operating in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan
[35:24.520 --> 35:26.520]  and other areas of North Africa
[35:26.520 --> 35:30.520]  and they just fly around with hellfire missiles on them
[35:30.520 --> 35:33.520]  their favorite target is a wedding
[35:33.520 --> 35:35.520]  because they can get a bunch of people together
[35:35.520 --> 35:37.520]  and they'll drop one bomb into the middle of it
[35:37.520 --> 35:40.520]  killing 120, 150, 200 in some cases
[35:40.520 --> 35:43.520]  or more people, you've seen it in the news
[35:43.520 --> 35:46.520]  and our media says well that's reasonable
[35:46.520 --> 35:49.520]  there were two terrorists out of the 150 people
[35:49.520 --> 35:51.520]  and that's acceptable
[35:51.520 --> 35:55.520]  I mean we've seen cases of where our military has bombed
[35:55.520 --> 36:01.520]  entire apartment complexes to kill one person
[36:01.520 --> 36:04.520]  and that's good, that's freedom
[36:04.520 --> 36:07.520]  but when Qaddafi reportedly does it
[36:07.520 --> 36:09.520]  we don't know if that's true, probably is
[36:09.520 --> 36:11.520]  and desperately for his dictatorship
[36:11.520 --> 36:14.520]  then it's oh my gosh we're so outraged
[36:14.520 --> 36:17.520]  this is terrible, it's kind of like when we hear reports of
[36:17.520 --> 36:20.520]  foreign governments torturing people
[36:20.520 --> 36:23.520]  and it's oh this is so terrible, this is so dark
[36:23.520 --> 36:27.520]  this is so evil, we need to invade
[36:27.520 --> 36:30.520]  this country or that country
[36:30.520 --> 36:32.520]  we need to go into Sudan
[36:32.520 --> 36:34.520]  because the Muslims in the north
[36:34.520 --> 36:37.520]  they get the Christians and they torture them
[36:37.520 --> 36:40.520]  they get the Christian soldiers and they torture them
[36:40.520 --> 36:42.520]  they pull their fingernails out
[36:42.520 --> 36:45.520]  they beat them
[36:45.520 --> 36:47.520]  but then when our government comes out
[36:47.520 --> 36:49.520]  Rumsfeld says yeah we're taking off the gloves
[36:49.520 --> 36:51.520]  yeah we're torturing and the White House memos
[36:51.520 --> 36:55.520]  it's like good, that's what Jack Bauer does
[36:55.520 --> 36:58.520]  on 24 man, that's getting tough
[36:58.520 --> 37:01.520]  it's getting tough strafling and bombing
[37:01.520 --> 37:04.520]  big crowds and markets and people meeting for weddings
[37:04.520 --> 37:07.520]  or people fishing by the side of a river
[37:07.520 --> 37:09.520]  what the Pentagon put out last year
[37:09.520 --> 37:12.520]  unknown terrorist will now be targeted
[37:12.520 --> 37:14.520]  in fact people won't believe that, Google
[37:14.520 --> 37:17.520]  unknown terrorist, no name terrorist
[37:17.520 --> 37:19.520]  will now be targeted by drones
[37:19.520 --> 37:22.520]  and it says in Pakistan and Afghanistan
[37:22.520 --> 37:24.520]  we don't even have to know their name
[37:24.520 --> 37:25.520]  or know exactly who they are
[37:25.520 --> 37:28.520]  if they look like a terrorist, a guy with a
[37:28.520 --> 37:34.520]  turban on and a gown on
[37:34.520 --> 37:36.520]  with an AK-47, we're going to go ahead
[37:36.520 --> 37:41.520]  and drop a $300,000 missile on them
[37:41.520 --> 37:44.520]  no name terrorist now being targeted in drone attacks
[37:44.520 --> 37:47.520]  I think that was MSNBC and Associated Press
[37:47.520 --> 37:48.520]  let's see if I'm right
[37:48.520 --> 37:50.520]  that was about a year ago, maybe even two
[37:50.520 --> 37:54.520]  but again, think about the hypocrisy
[37:54.520 --> 37:57.520]  when the globalists that run our country
[37:57.520 --> 37:59.520]  torture, it's good
[37:59.520 --> 38:01.520]  when the globalists that run our country
[38:01.520 --> 38:03.520]  spy on us without warrants, right out of East Germany
[38:03.520 --> 38:06.520]  or 1984, it's good
[38:06.520 --> 38:09.520]  when the globalists strafe and kill people, it's good
[38:09.520 --> 38:11.520]  when they do all of this, it's wonderful
[38:11.520 --> 38:14.520]  but then when somebody else
[38:14.520 --> 38:17.520]  reportedly does it, it is the most horrible thing
[38:17.520 --> 38:20.520]  in the world, it is, oh it's horrible
[38:20.520 --> 38:22.520]  we've all got to be of one voice together
[38:22.520 --> 38:25.520]  right now and condemn this
[38:25.520 --> 38:28.520]  you know, some say that
[38:28.520 --> 38:31.520]  sometimes the Libyans torture people
[38:31.520 --> 38:33.520]  and we're like, well here's army manuals
[38:33.520 --> 38:35.520]  from Vietnam on how to torture
[38:35.520 --> 38:38.520]  including hooking electrodes to men and women's genitals
[38:38.520 --> 38:41.520]  well that's patriotic, that's very patriotic, that's good
[38:41.520 --> 38:43.520]  yeah, but you just said torture was wrong
[38:43.520 --> 38:46.520]  well it's wrong when then people with brown skin do it
[38:46.520 --> 38:49.520]  but when we do it, it's patriot
[38:49.520 --> 38:53.520]  it's patriot
[38:53.520 --> 38:56.520]  and then of course, the fools errand
[38:56.520 --> 38:58.520]  people that get into all of this
[38:58.520 --> 39:01.520]  and sit there watching
[39:01.520 --> 39:04.520]  shock and awe, devastation in Iraq
[39:04.520 --> 39:07.520]  as whole high rise buildings are bombed
[39:07.520 --> 39:11.520]  with 4,000 pound salvos
[39:11.520 --> 39:15.520]  I've talked to pizza place owners
[39:15.520 --> 39:18.520]  liquor store owners over the years
[39:18.520 --> 39:21.520]  and they've told me, because I'd already noticed it
[39:21.520 --> 39:24.520]  that holidays aren't the biggest time for liquor
[39:24.520 --> 39:26.520]  and pizza orders
[39:26.520 --> 39:28.520]  things that are seen as celebratory
[39:28.520 --> 39:30.520]  the Super Bowl isn't even
[39:30.520 --> 39:32.520]  it's when a new war is launched
[39:32.520 --> 39:34.520]  and CNN and Fox are covering it
[39:34.520 --> 39:36.520]  every good old boy pulls in
[39:36.520 --> 39:38.520]  gets their favorite liquor
[39:38.520 --> 39:40.520]  they buy steaks, they go in
[39:40.520 --> 39:43.520]  they cook it up and they feel so manly
[39:43.520 --> 39:46.520]  it's like a video game, yeah look at that building blow up
[39:46.520 --> 39:49.520]  woo, boy I'm feeling good right now
[39:49.520 --> 39:51.520]  woo
[39:51.520 --> 39:54.520]  and they all get their little American flags
[39:54.520 --> 39:56.520]  and they put them on their cars
[39:56.520 --> 39:58.520]  and they drive around while the group
[39:58.520 --> 40:00.520]  that's attacking those countries
[40:00.520 --> 40:02.520]  those innocent countries and killing
[40:02.520 --> 40:04.520]  in Iraq at least a million people
[40:04.520 --> 40:07.520]  as a result of it
[40:07.520 --> 40:10.520]  don't you understand the globalist CU
[40:10.520 --> 40:12.520]  as just as worthless as an Iraqi
[40:12.520 --> 40:14.520]  or a Libyan or an Egyptian
[40:14.520 --> 40:17.520]  or a North Vietnamese
[40:17.520 --> 40:22.520]  and it's getting crazy
[40:22.520 --> 40:25.520]  again, Obama condemns Libyan violence
[40:25.520 --> 40:27.520]  calls for international response
[40:27.520 --> 40:29.520]  and says that in the days previous
[40:29.520 --> 40:33.520]  they are preparing to intervene
[40:33.520 --> 40:35.520]  with military force
[40:35.520 --> 40:37.520]  and they go on and say because they're
[40:37.520 --> 40:40.520]  abusing the democracy protesters
[40:40.520 --> 40:43.520]  yeah, when you saw footage in Bahrain
[40:43.520 --> 40:46.520]  where they were actually shooting unarmed people with flags
[40:46.520 --> 40:48.520]  that's one thing but
[40:48.520 --> 40:50.520]  what do you think would happen in the U.S.
[40:50.520 --> 40:52.520]  if you and ten of your buddies
[40:52.520 --> 40:55.520]  went and tried to attack the front gate
[40:55.520 --> 40:57.520]  at a major military base
[40:57.520 --> 40:59.520]  within seconds
[40:59.520 --> 41:02.520]  machine guns would open up on you
[41:02.520 --> 41:05.520]  I mean, that's a fact
[41:05.520 --> 41:08.520]  that's a stated default position
[41:08.520 --> 41:10.520]  so if you look carefully in all the cases
[41:10.520 --> 41:13.520]  where Gaddafi reportedly, we know it's true
[41:13.520 --> 41:15.520]  has bombed and strafed people
[41:15.520 --> 41:18.520]  using commandeered tanks
[41:18.520 --> 41:20.520]  to run over fences
[41:20.520 --> 41:22.520]  and invade military bases
[41:22.520 --> 41:24.520]  all the dictator, what do you think he's going to do?
[41:24.520 --> 41:25.520]  I'm not saying it's good
[41:25.520 --> 41:27.520]  what do you think our government would do
[41:27.520 --> 41:31.520]  if we tried to take over military bases?
[41:31.520 --> 41:35.520]  I mean, this is total and complete hypocrisy
[41:35.520 --> 41:38.520]  and
[41:38.520 --> 41:40.520]  he's got chemical weapons
[41:40.520 --> 41:43.520]  and by the way, the evidence is now clear
[41:43.520 --> 41:48.520]  in 1991, Saddam Hussein did fire off chemicals
[41:48.520 --> 41:50.520]  and to get rid of the evidence
[41:50.520 --> 41:52.520]  it was all videotaped by the Marine demolition teams
[41:52.520 --> 41:54.520]  it's online
[41:54.520 --> 41:56.520]  the U.S. markings, the Russian markings
[41:56.520 --> 41:58.520]  but mainly U.S. in the Camicia
[41:58.520 --> 42:00.520]  and hundreds of other dumps
[42:00.520 --> 42:01.520]  it was one of the biggest
[42:01.520 --> 42:02.520]  and they blew them up
[42:02.520 --> 42:04.520]  in fact, the news thought that
[42:04.520 --> 42:06.520]  nukes were going off
[42:06.520 --> 42:08.520]  because it was creating such big mushroom clouds
[42:08.520 --> 42:10.520]  and they blew up giant ammo depots
[42:10.520 --> 42:14.520]  with sarin
[42:14.520 --> 42:16.520]  warhead dips
[42:16.520 --> 42:18.520]  and then all of the troops
[42:18.520 --> 42:21.520]  they wore tape on their uniforms
[42:21.520 --> 42:23.520]  they wore tape on their tanks
[42:23.520 --> 42:24.520]  and on their Humvees
[42:24.520 --> 42:26.520]  and on their Bradley fighting vehicles
[42:26.520 --> 42:29.520]  it's white tape with black stripes down it
[42:29.520 --> 42:31.520]  white tape with black stripes down it
[42:31.520 --> 42:34.520]  and it's white when there's not a chemical weapon
[42:34.520 --> 42:36.520]  it gets stripes when there are
[42:36.520 --> 42:38.520]  and the chemical weapon detectors
[42:38.520 --> 42:41.520]  the Nazi ones and Humvees went off
[42:41.520 --> 42:43.520]  that were actual chemical sensors
[42:43.520 --> 42:45.520]  the tape all got stripes
[42:45.520 --> 42:47.520]  and they came on the news and said
[42:47.520 --> 42:49.520]  those were all false
[42:49.520 --> 42:53.520]  false positives, your tape malfunctioned
[42:53.520 --> 42:55.520]  and then we saw the congressional hearings
[42:55.520 --> 42:57.520]  of them wheeling in Marine Corps
[42:57.520 --> 42:59.520]  captains and colonels and others
[42:59.520 --> 43:01.520]  and wheelchairs, remember all the footage
[43:01.520 --> 43:03.520]  and army officers
[43:03.520 --> 43:06.520]  then, I believe in my country
[43:06.520 --> 43:09.520]  now I'm dying, the nerve gas
[43:09.520 --> 43:11.520]  and then remember it came out years later
[43:11.520 --> 43:13.520]  they did autopsies on the thousands and thousands
[43:13.520 --> 43:17.520]  that died and their brain stems were full of sarin
[43:17.520 --> 43:20.520]  the globalists knew full well they're like
[43:20.520 --> 43:22.520]  well the human weapon inspectors are about to come in here
[43:22.520 --> 43:23.520]  after we take it over
[43:23.520 --> 43:26.520]  we got to blow all this stuff up we sold them
[43:26.520 --> 43:29.520]  and so they blow up over a hundred
[43:29.520 --> 43:32.520]  and I've had Dr. Doug Rocky who was involved in it
[43:32.520 --> 43:34.520]  head of the DU program
[43:34.520 --> 43:37.520]  and he's gone, most of his team is dead or dying
[43:37.520 --> 43:40.520]  what is it 20 years later
[43:40.520 --> 43:43.520]  and he's corrected me when I said
[43:43.520 --> 43:46.520]  dozens of large bases said no it was over a hundred
[43:46.520 --> 43:48.520]  blowing them up
[43:48.520 --> 43:50.520]  sending demolition teams in with old
[43:50.520 --> 43:53.520]  rotten plastic hazmat gear
[43:53.520 --> 43:56.520]  that stuff isn't brand new and perfect folks
[43:56.520 --> 43:58.520]  you're deader than a hammer it'll soft kill you
[43:58.520 --> 44:01.520]  if you don't drop dead right there it'll soft kill you later
[44:01.520 --> 44:04.520]  but do they want to give health care to all those people
[44:04.520 --> 44:06.520]  absolutely not
[44:06.520 --> 44:09.520]  and so if you look at the numbers
[44:09.520 --> 44:12.520]  of birth defects it's triple to quadruple
[44:12.520 --> 44:14.520]  depending on the service you look at
[44:14.520 --> 44:17.520]  it's 15 times the world average
[44:17.520 --> 44:20.520]  for deformities in places like Fallujah
[44:20.520 --> 44:24.520]  so there's sarin, vx, mustard
[44:27.520 --> 44:30.520]  the list goes on and on
[44:30.520 --> 44:32.520]  blown up
[44:32.520 --> 44:34.520]  but the front line trips who blew it up
[44:34.520 --> 44:36.520]  they were at least in rotten
[44:36.520 --> 44:38.520]  you know how water hoses get old and break up
[44:38.520 --> 44:40.520]  well same with the plastic I've talked to so many trips
[44:40.520 --> 44:42.520]  in the video where they just put them on
[44:42.520 --> 44:44.520]  they would rip in minutes walking
[44:44.520 --> 44:46.520]  gas masks that didn't work
[44:46.520 --> 44:48.520]  and they tell them alright get back two miles
[44:48.520 --> 44:50.520]  we're gonna detonate it
[44:50.520 --> 44:52.520]  boom boom boom boom
[44:52.520 --> 44:54.520]  mushroom cloud
[44:54.520 --> 44:56.520]  chemical weapons detectors all over the region
[44:56.520 --> 44:58.520]  alert alert alert
[44:58.520 --> 45:01.520]  don't worry no there's no nerve gas
[45:03.520 --> 45:05.520]  but go ahead and get your hazmat suits
[45:05.520 --> 45:08.520]  in 130 degree weather
[45:11.520 --> 45:14.520]  and so the troops were soft killed
[45:14.520 --> 45:16.520]  and the Pentagon
[45:16.520 --> 45:18.520]  the lawsuits have been filed the documents
[45:18.520 --> 45:20.520]  the last 20 years have come out
[45:20.520 --> 45:22.520]  that they full well knew what was happening
[45:22.520 --> 45:24.520]  because there had been a change in policy
[45:24.520 --> 45:26.520]  so what if the troops breathe nerve gas
[45:26.520 --> 45:28.520]  and they die of natural causes
[45:28.520 --> 45:30.520]  so what if they die a week later
[45:30.520 --> 45:32.520]  a year later five years later
[45:32.520 --> 45:34.520]  20 years later
[45:34.520 --> 45:36.520]  so what every time they do an autopsy
[45:36.520 --> 45:38.520]  that the brainstem is filled
[45:38.520 --> 45:40.520]  with serum
[45:40.520 --> 45:42.520]  what do you think most of these men and women
[45:42.520 --> 45:44.520]  who believe they were fighting for America
[45:44.520 --> 45:46.520]  get neurological disorders
[45:46.520 --> 45:48.520]  and then they'll just give them a name for it
[45:48.520 --> 45:50.520]  and say oh no you naturally got this
[45:50.520 --> 45:52.520]  but then good scientists
[45:52.520 --> 45:54.520]  good coroners ask the widows
[45:54.520 --> 45:56.520]  may we
[45:56.520 --> 45:58.520]  look at your husband's brain
[45:58.520 --> 46:00.520]  before you bury him
[46:00.520 --> 46:02.520]  before you involve him
[46:02.520 --> 46:04.520]  and they say sure in some cases women as well
[46:04.520 --> 46:06.520]  there's been congressional hearings on this
[46:06.520 --> 46:08.520]  and they go in and take your portable brain out
[46:08.520 --> 46:10.520]  and it's shriveled
[46:10.520 --> 46:12.520]  and you read the reports your brain
[46:12.520 --> 46:14.520]  is necrosed
[46:14.520 --> 46:16.520]  tissue tested
[46:16.520 --> 46:18.520]  brain completely
[46:18.520 --> 46:20.520]  adulterated
[46:20.520 --> 46:22.520]  with nerve gas
[46:22.520 --> 46:24.520]  that have broken down
[46:24.520 --> 46:26.520]  in the human metabolic system
[46:26.520 --> 46:28.520]  highest concentrations in brainstem
[46:28.520 --> 46:30.520]  and when they go in
[46:30.520 --> 46:32.520]  guys who could bitch press 350 pounds
[46:32.520 --> 46:34.520]  perfect shape you know captains
[46:34.520 --> 46:36.520]  colonels you name it tough guys
[46:36.520 --> 46:38.520]  they're like oh my muscles all
[46:38.520 --> 46:40.520]  dissolving I'm shaking and they're like you're fine
[46:40.520 --> 46:42.520]  a month later in a wheelchair
[46:42.520 --> 46:44.520]  help me help me please help me
[46:44.520 --> 46:46.520]  they're like
[46:46.520 --> 46:48.520]  there's nothing wrong with you
[46:48.520 --> 46:52.520]  time for you to go in the casket now
[46:52.520 --> 46:54.520]  or the teams that
[46:54.520 --> 46:56.520]  to clean up the DU like Doug Rocky
[46:56.520 --> 46:58.520]  rashes all over him vomiting diarrhea for years
[46:58.520 --> 47:00.520]  teeth falling out
[47:00.520 --> 47:02.520]  his men dying around him
[47:02.520 --> 47:04.520]  he's had 30 plus surgeries
[47:06.520 --> 47:08.520]  the guys like Darth Vader now
[47:08.520 --> 47:10.520]  he's having surgeries almost every month
[47:10.520 --> 47:12.520]  a battle and the cancer is being removed
[47:12.520 --> 47:14.520]  and kidney surgery and liver
[47:14.520 --> 47:16.520]  but he still comes on this show
[47:16.520 --> 47:18.520]  and fights and travels all over the country
[47:18.520 --> 47:20.520]  during the breaks he's
[47:20.520 --> 47:22.520]  he gets back on air man's up you can't even tell
[47:22.520 --> 47:24.520]  the guys dying
[47:26.520 --> 47:28.520]  blood just starts pouring out of his nose
[47:28.520 --> 47:30.520]  routinely skin just flaking off and falling
[47:30.520 --> 47:32.520]  oh DU's not going to hurt you
[47:32.520 --> 47:34.520]  he's like I'm a physicist I wrote the book
[47:34.520 --> 47:36.520]  on this stuff for you guys we've got a
[47:36.520 --> 47:38.520]  you know
[47:38.520 --> 47:40.520]  why did you use it you're not supposed to
[47:40.520 --> 47:42.520]  get in there Doug Rocky
[47:42.520 --> 47:44.520]  Vietnam combat vet you name it
[47:44.520 --> 47:46.520]  one of that main guys that train police
[47:46.520 --> 47:48.520]  and military and the cadres that train everybody else
[47:48.520 --> 47:50.520]  on WMD
[47:50.520 --> 47:52.520]  and they just write him off
[47:52.520 --> 47:54.520]  just write him off just and
[47:54.520 --> 47:56.520]  why have I told you this historical
[47:56.520 --> 47:58.520]  account
[47:58.520 --> 48:00.520]  because they'll send NATO
[48:00.520 --> 48:02.520]  UN US troops into Tripoli
[48:02.520 --> 48:04.520]  and there's a good chance he's going to
[48:04.520 --> 48:06.520]  fire off a bunch of scuds
[48:06.520 --> 48:08.520]  and a bunch of artillery
[48:08.520 --> 48:10.520]  and when that nerve gas
[48:10.520 --> 48:12.520]  hits the general population
[48:12.520 --> 48:14.520]  it's going to kill him
[48:14.520 --> 48:16.520]  and when the troops get hit with it
[48:16.520 --> 48:18.520]  if any of it gets through their suit
[48:18.520 --> 48:20.520]  it's going to kill him maybe a week
[48:20.520 --> 48:22.520]  maybe ten years but it's going to kill you
[48:22.520 --> 48:24.520]  and when it kills you
[48:24.520 --> 48:26.520]  they're going to say sit down and shut up
[48:26.520 --> 48:28.520]  nothing's wrong with you
[48:28.520 --> 48:30.520]  and nobody's going to talk about
[48:30.520 --> 48:32.520]  who sold Muammar Gaddafi
[48:32.520 --> 48:34.520]  most of his chemical weapons
[48:34.520 --> 48:36.520]  it's on record the British are the biggest sellers to him
[48:38.520 --> 48:40.520]  he's got a high
[48:40.520 --> 48:42.520]  tech weapons arsenal
[48:42.520 --> 48:44.520]  compared to even Saddam Hussein
[48:46.520 --> 48:48.520]  Saddam Hussein had a pretty powerful arsenal
[48:48.520 --> 48:50.520]  but it was badly coordinated until the 1991 war
[48:50.520 --> 48:52.520]  when it was almost all destroyed
[48:52.520 --> 48:54.520]  he had almost nothing by 2003
[48:58.520 --> 49:00.520]  the inspectors had been there for 13 years
[49:00.520 --> 49:02.520]  12 years tearing everything up
[49:02.520 --> 49:04.520]  Gaddafi's been there since the late 1960s
[49:04.520 --> 49:06.520]  what 1968
[49:06.520 --> 49:08.520]  Gaddafi's had all that oil money
[49:08.520 --> 49:10.520]  Gaddafi has got that place
[49:10.520 --> 49:12.520]  ringed as a ring of death
[49:12.520 --> 49:14.520]  and the CIA and the globalists
[49:14.520 --> 49:16.520]  may control the mob in the street
[49:16.520 --> 49:18.520]  a lot of them have legitimate beefs
[49:18.520 --> 49:20.520]  but now they're going to have to dig out the military
[49:20.520 --> 49:22.520]  what they're hoping is
[49:22.520 --> 49:24.520]  is that as the fleet prepares to invade
[49:24.520 --> 49:26.520]  and start bombarding
[49:26.520 --> 49:28.520]  his hardened emplacements
[49:28.520 --> 49:30.520]  that they can knock out those weapons
[49:30.520 --> 49:32.520]  but they're still going to leak
[49:32.520 --> 49:34.520]  and they're hoping that his military
[49:34.520 --> 49:36.520]  defects and then he falls
[49:36.520 --> 49:38.520]  that way and then the international I-4 force
[49:38.520 --> 49:40.520]  that by the way
[49:40.520 --> 49:42.520]  was in the Ottawa
[49:42.520 --> 49:44.520]  citizen two days ago
[49:44.520 --> 49:46.520]  they're preparing an I-4 international force
[49:46.520 --> 49:48.520]  for the US and Canada
[49:48.520 --> 49:50.520]  I tell you man they have got this whole thing
[49:50.520 --> 49:52.520]  one day when we have a big war
[49:52.520 --> 49:54.520]  with Mexico and the globalists
[49:54.520 --> 49:56.520]  and the Ford Foundation trigger
[49:56.520 --> 49:58.520]  the Mecheloraza teams
[49:58.520 --> 50:00.520]  that they've gotten this country
[50:00.520 --> 50:02.520]  for unrest
[50:02.520 --> 50:04.520]  and don't worry though the international stabilization
[50:04.520 --> 50:06.520]  I-4 force is going to stop
[50:06.520 --> 50:08.520]  the ethnic warfare just like in Serbia
[50:08.520 --> 50:10.520]  this is how the globalists
[50:10.520 --> 50:12.520]  operate so I'm going to tell the military
[50:12.520 --> 50:14.520]  something again
[50:14.520 --> 50:16.520]  last year AP and Bloomberg reported
[50:16.520 --> 50:18.520]  we covered it at Nausium
[50:18.520 --> 50:20.520]  that in 1999 they signed
[50:20.520 --> 50:22.520]  a secret deal with the VA
[50:24.520 --> 50:26.520]  to
[50:26.520 --> 50:28.520]  keep their people in the dark
[50:28.520 --> 50:30.520]  and to take
[50:30.520 --> 50:32.520]  the death benefits of World War II
[50:32.520 --> 50:34.520]  that's right through current vets
[50:34.520 --> 50:36.520]  so that when your husband or wife has been putting money
[50:36.520 --> 50:38.520]  into that life insurance policy
[50:38.520 --> 50:40.520]  dies
[50:40.520 --> 50:42.520]  they send you a fast one and say sign this form
[50:42.520 --> 50:44.520]  and then you sign it and then you never get any money
[50:44.520 --> 50:46.520]  it says sign this form to get your money
[50:46.520 --> 50:48.520]  the government allows them to do that
[50:48.520 --> 50:50.520]  it tricks you and then you don't get the money
[50:50.520 --> 50:52.520]  folks they're robbing
[50:52.520 --> 50:54.520]  the veterans death benefits
[50:54.520 --> 50:56.520]  they paid for their insurance policies
[50:56.520 --> 50:58.520]  they let them breathe
[50:58.520 --> 51:00.520]  nerve gas and die and don't give them aid
[51:00.520 --> 51:02.520]  we all know that Berkey water purification

[52:34.520 --> 52:36.520]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke and Arsonists

[53:57.520 --> 53:59.520]  right now
[54:19.520 --> 54:21.520]  a few program notes here
[54:21.520 --> 54:23.520]  the machine is on
[54:23.520 --> 54:25.520]  during the third hour today
[54:25.520 --> 54:27.520]  he's a friend of mine
[54:27.520 --> 54:29.520]  I asked the audience to pray for him
[54:29.520 --> 54:31.520]  he's been a frequent guest in the last six years
[54:31.520 --> 54:33.520]  here on the show
[54:33.520 --> 54:35.520]  he's a good guy who'd been sober
[54:35.520 --> 54:37.520]  off and on almost completely for a decade
[54:37.520 --> 54:39.520]  all the times I've spent with him
[54:39.520 --> 54:41.520]  all he does is research the news
[54:41.520 --> 54:43.520]  and give to charity
[54:43.520 --> 54:45.520]  and spend time with his family
[54:45.520 --> 54:47.520]  and didn't drink
[54:47.520 --> 54:49.520]  didn't ever use drugs
[54:49.520 --> 54:51.520]  and then he got in with some folks
[54:51.520 --> 54:53.520]  and kind of fell off the wagon
[54:53.520 --> 54:55.520]  but he is clean
[54:55.520 --> 54:57.520]  when I was out of his house
[54:57.520 --> 54:59.520]  and I can talk about it now because other people have already talked about it on record
[54:59.520 --> 55:01.520]  but I mean you know
[55:01.520 --> 55:03.520]  they had his counselors there
[55:03.520 --> 55:05.520]  and he just wanted his friends there to help him
[55:05.520 --> 55:07.520]  and his baseball buddies and people
[55:07.520 --> 55:09.520]  and other Hollywood folks
[55:09.520 --> 55:11.520]  and he's just exercising
[55:11.520 --> 55:13.520]  every day at seven
[55:13.520 --> 55:15.520]  in the morning
[55:15.520 --> 55:17.520]  he's sometimes a couple times a day
[55:17.520 --> 55:19.520]  he's putting on weight
[55:19.520 --> 55:21.520]  but
[55:21.520 --> 55:23.520]  in the six and a half years I've known Charlie
[55:23.520 --> 55:25.520]  he's got the most
[55:25.520 --> 55:27.520]  energy I've ever seen
[55:27.520 --> 55:29.520]  and I've noticed it's the same way with myself
[55:29.520 --> 55:31.520]  only a few times have I
[55:31.520 --> 55:33.520]  completely kicked coffee
[55:33.520 --> 55:35.520]  which is a powerful drug
[55:35.520 --> 55:37.520]  and about a week after I'm totally tired
[55:37.520 --> 55:39.520]  for a week, a week later I just
[55:39.520 --> 55:41.520]  my brain works so much better
[55:41.520 --> 55:43.520]  I have so much more energy
[55:43.520 --> 55:45.520]  dozens of times I've kicked tobacco
[55:45.520 --> 55:47.520]  I started playing baseball with friends
[55:47.520 --> 55:49.520]  when I was like 10, 11, 12 and by 12
[55:49.520 --> 55:51.520]  they'd have their brothers
[55:51.520 --> 55:53.520]  Levi Garrett
[55:53.520 --> 55:55.520]  Red Man chewing tobacco and I would try to do what was cool
[55:55.520 --> 55:57.520]  and get sick the first few times
[55:57.520 --> 55:59.520]  and pretty soon you want that chewing tobacco
[55:59.520 --> 56:01.520]  pretty soon you're like hey can I give your brother $5
[56:01.520 --> 56:03.520]  because he's old enough
[56:03.520 --> 56:05.520]  you know he's 18 to go buy
[56:05.520 --> 56:07.520]  me some Red Man
[56:07.520 --> 56:09.520]  and I mean it's a horrible drug
[56:09.520 --> 56:11.520]  so I mean can I sit here
[56:11.520 --> 56:13.520]  and judge Rush Limbaugh
[56:13.520 --> 56:15.520]  totally addicted on synthetic heroin
[56:15.520 --> 56:17.520]  oxycontin, no
[56:17.520 --> 56:19.520]  people were attacking him I said the guy had a bunch of back surgeries
[56:19.520 --> 56:21.520]  you know people have car wrecks
[56:21.520 --> 56:23.520]  people have
[56:23.520 --> 56:25.520]  things happen to them and they get addicted to things
[56:25.520 --> 56:27.520]  the few times I've had to take
[56:27.520 --> 56:29.520]  pain pills it makes me throw up so I could never
[56:29.520 --> 56:31.520]  use opiates
[56:31.520 --> 56:33.520]  but some people boy it's like a
[56:33.520 --> 56:35.520]  light switch goes off and they're like man this is for me
[56:37.520 --> 56:39.520]  I don't judge Rush Limbaugh for that
[56:39.520 --> 56:41.520]  I judge people
[56:41.520 --> 56:43.520]  I judge people for doing
[56:43.520 --> 56:45.520]  consciously evil things to hurt other people
[56:45.520 --> 56:47.520]  evil is
[56:47.520 --> 56:49.520]  are folks that enjoy hurting people that get
[56:49.520 --> 56:51.520]  into it
[56:51.520 --> 56:53.520]  that
[56:53.520 --> 56:55.520]  you know kill a million Iraqis that's not a sin
[56:55.520 --> 56:57.520]  but Charlie Sheen
[56:57.520 --> 56:59.520]  started taking some drugs and drinking again
[57:01.520 --> 57:03.520]  I mean you know King David
[57:03.520 --> 57:05.520]  had his best friend murdered
[57:05.520 --> 57:07.520]  so he could have his wife
[57:07.520 --> 57:09.520]  and then King David got on his knees
[57:09.520 --> 57:11.520]  and truly repented and his heart was right
[57:11.520 --> 57:13.520]  and
[57:13.520 --> 57:15.520]  God said you're a man after my own heart
[57:15.520 --> 57:17.520]  again it's the heart
[57:17.520 --> 57:19.520]  that matters
[57:19.520 --> 57:21.520]  and
[57:21.520 --> 57:23.520]  I just want people
[57:23.520 --> 57:25.520]  the issue is Charlie is pretty wild
[57:25.520 --> 57:27.520]  I mean he has so much energy now
[57:27.520 --> 57:29.520]  working out
[57:29.520 --> 57:31.520]  couple times a day most days
[57:31.520 --> 57:33.520]  you know eating good food
[57:33.520 --> 57:35.520]  you know drinking
[57:35.520 --> 57:37.520]  you know stuff like
[57:37.520 --> 57:39.520]  inner foods and other branded
[57:39.520 --> 57:41.520]  you know that green food that has all the superfoods
[57:41.520 --> 57:43.520]  and all the super shakes
[57:43.520 --> 57:45.520]  I mean the guy is super smart
[57:45.520 --> 57:47.520]  and
[57:47.520 --> 57:49.520]  I was talking to him a few weeks ago and I was at his house
[57:49.520 --> 57:51.520]  and I was like is this true about this woman
[57:51.520 --> 57:53.520]  no never matter is this true
[57:53.520 --> 57:55.520]  about the suitcase full of cocaine
[57:55.520 --> 57:57.520]  he goes no was it true blood was shooting out of your nose
[57:57.520 --> 57:59.520]  no and he doesn't lie to me
[57:59.520 --> 58:01.520]  he doesn't lie he's brutally honest
[58:01.520 --> 58:03.520]  and we went over it all
[58:03.520 --> 58:05.520]  and I said you got to defend yourself
[58:05.520 --> 58:07.520]  and he said when I do
[58:07.520 --> 58:09.520]  they just spin it anyways
[58:09.520 --> 58:11.520]  he says yeah some of it's true
[58:11.520 --> 58:13.520]  most of it's exaggerated but I'm clean now
[58:13.520 --> 58:15.520]  and I want people to leave me alone
[58:15.520 --> 58:17.520]  and he said so just let him
[58:17.520 --> 58:19.520]  say what lies they want
[58:19.520 --> 58:21.520]  but then I was talking to him
[58:21.520 --> 58:23.520]  last week and he said you know what let's just go ahead
[58:23.520 --> 58:25.520]  and do the interview
[58:25.520 --> 58:27.520]  and so he's going to be all over the map
[58:27.520 --> 58:29.520]  and
[58:29.520 --> 58:31.520]  I mean he's wild folks he just starts spewing
[58:31.520 --> 58:33.520]  really powerful poetry
[58:33.520 --> 58:35.520]  right off the top of his head
[58:35.520 --> 58:37.520]  I mean he is really a
[58:37.520 --> 58:39.520]  dynamic guy and he's going to be on with us

[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:17.520]  this is Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:19.520]  and now live from Austin, Texas
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.520]  Alex Jones
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.520]  big new developments
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:35.520]  on the domino effect
[01:00:35.520 --> 01:00:37.520]  of the Middle East and North Africa
[01:00:37.520 --> 01:00:39.520]  Africa news reporting
[01:00:39.520 --> 01:00:41.520]  Benghazi units
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:43.520]  prepare to liberate Tripoli
[01:00:45.520 --> 01:00:47.520]  in liberated East Libya
[01:00:47.520 --> 01:00:49.520]  people are
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:51.520]  preparing to join units
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.520]  of armed forces that plan to go
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:55.520]  westwards to rescue protesters
[01:00:55.520 --> 01:00:57.520]  in Tripoli from Gaddafi's terror
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.520]  gotta love how that's phrased
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:01.520]  yeah it is government terror
[01:01:01.520 --> 01:01:03.520]  but the point is he's being overthrown
[01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:05.520]  so the globalist can have a new war
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:07.520]  and try to invade the country
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.520]  Benghazi Libya's second city
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:11.520]  focused on unrest
[01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:13.520]  has been a scene of celebration for the last few days
[01:01:13.520 --> 01:01:15.520]  after army units united with protesters
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:17.520]  and made it the center of liberated Libya
[01:01:17.520 --> 01:01:19.520]  people have danced in the streets
[01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:21.520]  shut up fireworks
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:23.520]  and even returned their arms
[01:01:23.520 --> 01:01:25.520]  to the military
[01:01:25.520 --> 01:01:27.520]  as popular communities
[01:01:27.520 --> 01:01:29.520]  have brought new order to the city
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:31.520]  oh aren't they good
[01:01:31.520 --> 01:01:33.520]  they're turning their guns in
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.520]  the media's like oh a symbol of liberty
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.520]  handing your firearm
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:39.520]  instead of the American eagle
[01:01:39.520 --> 01:01:41.520]  being our symbol the globalist could have it
[01:01:41.520 --> 01:01:43.520]  it wouldn't be an ostrich
[01:01:43.520 --> 01:01:45.520]  or it wouldn't be a sloth
[01:01:45.520 --> 01:01:47.520]  it would be a firearm being broken in two
[01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:49.520]  that's actually a UN symbol
[01:01:49.520 --> 01:01:51.520]  they push it's some type of sign of freedom
[01:01:51.520 --> 01:01:53.520]  that's a sign of slaves
[01:01:53.520 --> 01:01:55.520]  Benghazi again
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.520]  residents have also followed
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:01:59.520]  the
[01:01:59.520 --> 01:02:01.520]  horror still unfolding in Tripoli the capital
[01:02:01.520 --> 01:02:03.520]  they're increasingly receiving messages of desperation
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.520]  from Tripoli
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:07.520]  with the population they're asking for help
[01:02:07.520 --> 01:02:09.520]  from Benghazi and other liberated areas
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:11.520]  so they state here
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:13.520]  that the entire population
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:15.520]  says they're under terror
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.520]  the entire population wants to be liberated
[01:02:17.520 --> 01:02:19.520]  I've seen previous analysis
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:21.520]  of things in
[01:02:21.520 --> 01:02:23.520]  Libya
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:25.520]  and it looks like he's 50-50
[01:02:25.520 --> 01:02:27.520]  popular
[01:02:27.520 --> 01:02:29.520]  not a super unpopular dictator
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:31.520]  not saying he's good
[01:02:31.520 --> 01:02:33.520]  the point is is that this is a staged event
[01:02:33.520 --> 01:02:35.520]  and now they want to send in U.S. forces
[01:02:35.520 --> 01:02:37.520]  into the country
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:39.520]  but just notice how they just
[01:02:39.520 --> 01:02:41.520]  and all over our news
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:43.520]  supposedly professional news
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.520]  they just state these rumors as if they're fact
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.520]  oh he's left
[01:02:47.520 --> 01:02:49.520]  the British Foreign Ministry confirms
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:02:51.520]  he's on his way to Venezuela
[01:02:51.520 --> 01:02:53.520]  that was four days ago
[01:02:53.520 --> 01:02:55.520]  wasn't true
[01:02:55.520 --> 01:02:57.520]  so we don't know how much of this is true
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:02:59.520]  and how much of it isn't
[01:02:59.520 --> 01:03:01.520]  also in nearby Al Baida
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:03.520]  is trying to reorganize the city
[01:03:03.520 --> 01:03:05.520]  and provide security residents agree on Libyan unity
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:07.520]  and preparations to join the fight
[01:03:07.520 --> 01:03:09.520]  to liberate Tripoli
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:11.520]  so they're calling it Libyan unity
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:13.520]  like Obama said
[01:03:13.520 --> 01:03:15.520]  we must all be of one mind
[01:03:15.520 --> 01:03:17.520]  and that is we're going to invade
[01:03:17.520 --> 01:03:19.520]  or at least start
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:21.520]  bombarding him
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.520]  to help liberate the people
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.520]  so he can
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:27.520]  fire off a bunch of nerve gas and destabilize
[01:03:27.520 --> 01:03:29.520]  oh by the way oil prices
[01:03:29.520 --> 01:03:31.520]  crude reaches 119
[01:03:31.520 --> 01:03:33.520]  it went up 9%
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:35.520]  on Tuesday
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:37.520]  it went up over 3%
[01:03:37.520 --> 01:03:39.520]  on Wednesday
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:41.520]  and now it has surged today
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:45.520]  massively
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:47.520]  so here's the article
[01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:49.520]  crude reaches 119
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:03:51.520]  in frantic trading
[01:03:51.520 --> 01:03:53.520]  Brent crude reached 119
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:55.520]  a barrel during a period of
[01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:57.520]  frantic trading
[01:03:57.520 --> 01:03:59.520]  as industrial needs were hedged
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.520]  and traders exploited momentum
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:03.520]  worries that reduced supplies
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:05.520]  from Libya may have
[01:04:05.520 --> 01:04:07.520]  replicated in other regional producers
[01:04:07.520 --> 01:04:09.520]  facing potential political turmoil
[01:04:09.520 --> 01:04:11.520]  see this is going all over the world
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:13.520]  because the globalists are triggering
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:15.520]  and triggering it all over the world
[01:04:15.520 --> 01:04:17.520]  because of course everybody hates
[01:04:17.520 --> 01:04:19.520]  the government worldwide everybody hates
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.520]  corrupt stinking governments
[01:04:21.520 --> 01:04:23.520]  wickedness in high places
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:25.520]  our congress depending on the poll
[01:04:25.520 --> 01:04:27.520]  it went up to 119% approval rating
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:29.520]  but if a foreign group
[01:04:29.520 --> 01:04:31.520]  came in and organized
[01:04:31.520 --> 01:04:33.520]  people to start a war against our government
[01:04:33.520 --> 01:04:35.520]  and then people started burning things
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:37.520]  and taking over and then a foreign army
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:39.520]  was going to come in to help us liberate America
[01:04:39.520 --> 01:04:41.520]  why would the foreign army
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:43.520]  be doing that because they were going to put
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:45.520]  something in worse
[01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:47.520]  something they want in place
[01:04:47.520 --> 01:04:49.520]  understand what I'm saying ladies and gentlemen
[01:04:49.520 --> 01:04:51.520]  we're going to continue going over this
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.520]  Charlie Sheen is coming up in the next hour
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.520]  and this is
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:57.520]  interview is going to make headlines
[01:04:57.520 --> 01:05:25.520]  this is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:27.520]  now a new socialist legislation
[01:05:27.520 --> 01:05:29.520]  is only compounding the problem
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:31.520]  4 dangerous weather is always a threat
[01:05:31.520 --> 01:05:33.520]  to local grids
[01:05:33.520 --> 01:05:35.520]  every year thousands of families lose their power
[01:05:35.520 --> 01:05:37.520]  from weather related onages
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:39.520]  5 a solar power generator provides
[01:05:39.520 --> 01:05:41.520]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[01:05:41.520 --> 01:05:43.520]  folks I really believe in the solar power generators
[01:05:43.520 --> 01:05:45.520]  offered by solutions from science
[01:05:45.520 --> 01:05:47.520]  one of my old sponsors

[01:07:24.880 --> 01:07:30.880]  An America's biggest mall owner, general growth properties. In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:37.880]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[01:07:37.880 --> 01:07:45.880]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today. He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:07:45.880 --> 01:07:59.880]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com. That's endofamerica. The number 3.com. Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com. That's endofamerica3.com.
[01:08:15.880 --> 01:08:39.880]  This is a big deal. I cannot stress to you, the listeners of the syndicated radio broadcast and those watching as we simulcast at prisonplanet.tv in video living color,
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:53.880]  that Obama's speech last night, saying we in the past days have been preparing an international response into Libya. You notice they use the cover of Egypt to move in a couple more aircraft carriers and big task force groups.
[01:08:53.880 --> 01:09:15.880]  Oil prices have gone up more than $27 this week. They're up to $119 right now. We haven't seen oil prices at the gas pump this high since 2008, and they are preparing globalist backed units in Benghazi to try to invade Tripoli.
[01:09:15.880 --> 01:09:24.880]  The Wall Street Journal is reporting that they believe he has nerve gas and high tech missiles that he's going to try to use.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:34.880]  Now I want to pull back from this and look at the larger geopolitical ramifications because every political analyst who we have had on this show, and we only have people on who have been right about 95% of the time,
[01:09:34.880 --> 01:09:45.880]  people who really know what's happening in the world and folks that their information matches my research, but then they can take us even further because of their specialties in those areas are concurring.
[01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:58.880]  And we're saying years ago, months ago, you've heard them here, that there would be a destabilization campaign in the Middle East, that it was a new kamikaze mode instead of just invading Afghanistan or Iraq,
[01:09:58.880 --> 01:10:04.880]  or encircling Pakistan and inserting special ops that now caught a CIA guy there.
[01:10:04.880 --> 01:10:12.880]  Reportedly, the news is saying that he was trying to give an official material, nuclear material to al-Qaeda. That's groups they control.
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:18.880]  Again, it's a pretext to invade Pakistan. I mean, this is getting wild. Now it's 100% clear what's happening.
[01:10:18.880 --> 01:10:28.880]  Doesn't mean Hussein Mubarak's good. It doesn't mean that Muammar Qaddafi's good. It doesn't mean that the people running Saudi Arabia good. No, they're bad.
[01:10:28.880 --> 01:10:34.880]  And it's a political climate, an atmosphere where the globalist can knock the dominoes over. The question is, why do they want that?
[01:10:34.880 --> 01:10:42.880]  Now, I haven't talked or even read in the last few days. I probably should have, but I get so busy. Well, Wayne Madsen thinks about this.
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:53.880]  I know he predicted a lot of this years ago and again months ago on the show. Formerly, an anti-submarine warfare expert worked then in the NSA in a lot of other classified areas.
[01:10:53.880 --> 01:11:06.880]  He's written for some of the biggest magazines and newspapers in the nation, WayneMadsenReport.com. He reports on national security and international issues for major TV stations around the world.
[01:11:06.880 --> 01:11:18.880]  And he also reports routinely from what's happening at the National Press Club. So I don't know what he's going to say about what's happening in Tripoli or what's happening in Egypt or this domino effect,
[01:11:18.880 --> 01:11:27.880]  or Saudi Arabia handing out $37 million in a single day to people yesterday and the king having to come back to Saudi Arabia from his European pleasure palaces,
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:37.880]  worried about overthrow. But this, I believe, is the clear double cross of the more friendly Arab regimes or the more neutral ones to put things into an order out of chaos situation.
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:44.880]  And I predicted they would then blame the depression on this. And now I saw headlines the last two days that, oh, this is going to kill the recovery.
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:52.880]  Oh, we're going to have a depression because of this. Oh, the oil prices are going up because of this. No. The underlying situation is dollar devaluation.
[01:11:52.880 --> 01:11:58.880]  So for the next 30 minutes, we're joined by WayneMadsen and WayneMadsenReport. Wayne, you've heard me in the last three minutes.
[01:11:58.880 --> 01:12:09.880]  Break down my analysis of this and the horror of the prospect of U.N., NATO, U.S.-backed forces going into Tripoli. Give us your take on what you think.
[01:12:09.880 --> 01:12:26.880]  Well, I still believe that what we're seeing in North Africa, especially North Africa, was triggered by the same forces that triggered the anti-government, anti-Australian moves in Greece,
[01:12:26.880 --> 01:12:36.880]  where we had riots there again over the austerity measures of the budget cuts in the last few days. We saw it in Spain. We saw it in the U.K.
[01:12:36.880 --> 01:12:46.880]  And I think this is what really was seething under all the other problems we had in North Africa.
[01:12:46.880 --> 01:13:07.880]  Now, we know from the State Department cables, from WikiLeaks, that obviously the NGOs, the Soros-backed groups, the National Daumen for Democracy, the Freedom House, and these other NGOs that are always in there trying to stir up the opposition were involved in all these countries.
[01:13:07.880 --> 01:13:11.880]  Oh, they admit they are. They're bragging now, Wayne.
[01:13:11.880 --> 01:13:29.880]  Yeah. But I think where they miscalculated is they thought with the Jasmine Revolution in Tunisia and the Lotus Revolution in Egypt that these were going to be soft landing-type changeovers like they saw in Ukraine and a few of these other soft revolutions.
[01:13:29.880 --> 01:13:43.880]  But they miscalculated because of the unemployment and the high food prices and the disgust, especially amongst the young people, about these regimes. These things, these exploded.
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:54.880]  And I believe that they're not under control anymore. We know there were signs that Gaddafi last month was thinking about succession.
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:14:03.880]  Now, his son Saif al-Islam, Gaddafi, I've written about this. This guy was a sweetheart as far as the elites of Europe were concerned.
[01:14:03.880 --> 01:14:09.880]  He's a good friend of Lord Peter Mandelson, the former British Foreign Secretary, about business secretary.
[01:14:09.880 --> 01:14:17.880]  He's very good friends with Prince Andrew and also very good friends with Nathaniel Rothschild, the son of the Rothschild family.
[01:14:17.880 --> 01:14:26.880]  This is a crowd he traveled with. He's a graduate of the London School of Economics. But now we heard him defending his father on TV.
[01:14:26.880 --> 01:14:35.880]  He talked about, you know, he'll be shot if you are caught with weapons and all this type of thing. This is out of control.
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:47.880]  And Gaddafi's tent in Tripoli in October 2009, and it was the 40th anniversary of the coup, which he called his Green Revolution, and overthrew the king.
[01:14:47.880 --> 01:14:54.880]  But I find it interesting, last month Gaddafi gave back royal property seized from the king's family.
[01:14:54.880 --> 01:14:59.880]  This king, Peter's Al-Sinousi, now the Sinousi were from Cunghazi.
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:10.880]  Because that's the area that's broke away. So I believe that Gaddafi probably understood that the number of things in India that it takes were short.
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:19.880]  And he was looking at succession. Possibly a role for the former royal family, who he had deposed in 1969.
[01:15:19.880 --> 01:15:28.880]  Now, we don't know where they stand, but I think it's very instructive that the flag being used by the opposition is the royal royal flag.
[01:15:28.880 --> 01:15:34.880]  Okay, Wayne, we got you on short notice. You're on your cell phone. I'm going to wait a moment until it comes back and gets a little bit better.
[01:15:34.880 --> 01:15:41.880]  But the big issue I want to bring up to you, what do you make of Obama's incredible speech? I mean, this is war under another name.
[01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:47.880]  He says, we're preparing an intervention. We're preparing international forces to go in.
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:53.880]  And now they're reporting the Wall Street Journal and others that Gaddafi's, I believe it. I know he's got it.
[01:15:53.880 --> 01:15:58.880]  Heavily armed is going to try to use nerve gas on him. And I mean, this is a nightmare.
[01:15:58.880 --> 01:16:04.880]  Well, the Wall Street Journal, I'm always skeptical about them. They're neocons from the word go.
[01:16:04.880 --> 01:16:15.880]  We also have his Justice Minister who resigned saying that Gaddafi was totally behind Lockerbie when we know, to the contrary, it was Iran.
[01:16:15.880 --> 01:16:27.880]  Of course, George H. W. Bush found it convenient to blame Gaddafi because he didn't want Iran getting involved with plans to go into Iraq during the lead-up to Desert Storm.
[01:16:27.880 --> 01:16:38.880]  So there's a lot of people who have left Gaddafi's regime who, for one reason or another, sort of like those old Soviet defectors, they always would overstate the threat.
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:42.880]  Or it's like all the Iraqi defectors that we now know were paid to lie.
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:51.880]  Oh, absolutely, like Kerbal. So I would take some of what these guys are saying with the grain of salt about Gaddafi having bio and chemical weapons.
[01:16:51.880 --> 01:17:00.880]  After all, he allowed inspectors in there under the Bush administration, the last administration, to turn all that stuff over.
[01:17:00.880 --> 01:17:05.880]  So these people are obviously trying to score political points more with the Western media.
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:14.880]  But it was quite clear when I was in Tripoli that Gaddafi, who gave a speech today where he's talking about, he's no different than the Queen of England or the King of Thailand.
[01:17:14.880 --> 01:17:18.880]  He's just the figurehead. He has no real power.
[01:17:18.880 --> 01:17:22.880]  Well, when you first land in Tripoli, you see his portrait is everywhere.
[01:17:22.880 --> 01:17:38.880]  Huge portraits on the sides of buildings, over the overpasses on the highways, going into Tripoli, in hotels, in lobbies, in offices everywhere, you find Gaddafi looking down at you.
[01:17:38.880 --> 01:17:44.880]  Kind of like Janet Napolitano on the high-tech telescreens going in 9,000 locations.
[01:17:44.880 --> 01:17:49.880]  Another telltale sign of classical corruption in 1984 societies.
[01:17:49.880 --> 01:17:57.880]  Right. And it's clear that this was a dictatorship, but called a personality like in North Korea with Kim Jong-il.
[01:17:57.880 --> 01:18:03.880]  And the other thing I noted is people even close to Gaddafi would talk about him.
[01:18:03.880 --> 01:18:06.880]  It was clear that even the people in his regime did not like him.
[01:18:06.880 --> 01:18:12.880]  As a matter of fact, I asked him when I was in his tent, I said, what's with that guy?
[01:18:12.880 --> 01:18:14.880]  I know he doesn't drink, but he's clear.
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:19.880]  He's on medication thinking maybe the guy's ill, and they just smiled.
[01:18:19.880 --> 01:18:32.880]  He said hashish. So he said today, he said, oh, these kids out there involved in the rebellion are on hallucinogenic drugs when he should look in a mirror and see the picture of somebody.
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:37.880]  Oh, yeah. I mean, you can look at him, Wayne, and tell that he's on some hardcore drugs.
[01:18:37.880 --> 01:18:39.880]  Yeah, it has been for quite a long time.
[01:18:39.880 --> 01:18:43.880]  Now, back when we had an Air Force base and the wheel is outside of Tripoli,
[01:18:43.880 --> 01:18:48.880]  now he threw that base out in 69 when he took over, but when he was sergeant Gaddafi,
[01:18:48.880 --> 01:18:52.880]  he used to make regular runs up to the class 6 store at the base.
[01:18:52.880 --> 01:18:55.880]  That's the booze place.
[01:18:55.880 --> 01:18:59.880]  He would load up his gin and scotch and haul it back to Tripoli.
[01:18:59.880 --> 01:19:03.880]  Now, he said it was for the senior officers in the King's Army,
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:09.880]  but I also heard from people who were at wheel is that he grabbed a few of those bottles for himself.
[01:19:09.880 --> 01:19:18.880]  Gaddafi is an enigma wrapped in an enigma, but there's even some questions about his mother being full-blooded Italian.
[01:19:18.880 --> 01:19:24.880]  So he may not be a pure-blooded Arab.
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:27.880]  Well, we're going to come back and get into other facets of this,
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:33.880]  but studying the region and the other larger geopolitical ramifications, who are the different factions?
[01:19:33.880 --> 01:19:36.880]  What countries do you see that are going to fall next?
[01:19:36.880 --> 01:19:41.880]  What do you think about Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Yemen, even Jordan?
[01:19:41.880 --> 01:19:46.880]  We've got now riots flaring up and around Israel and the West Bank and other areas,
[01:19:46.880 --> 01:19:49.880]  some rockets being fired reportedly.
[01:19:49.880 --> 01:19:54.880]  It's like somebody lit the fuse and the bombs are starting to go off in a chain reaction.
[01:19:54.880 --> 01:19:56.880]  Wayne Madsen is our guest.

[01:22:18.880 --> 01:22:21.880]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:22:21.880 --> 01:22:27.880]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:22:27.880 --> 01:22:31.880]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:22:31.880 --> 01:22:38.880]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[01:22:38.880 --> 01:22:42.880]  I can't stress this enough. You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:46.880]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.

[01:22:59.880 --> 01:23:03.880]  Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?
[01:23:03.880 --> 01:23:08.880]  18 years ago, we developed a program that has made thousands debt-free in just 90 days.
[01:23:08.880 --> 01:23:11.880]  It's called Zero Debt in 90 Days, and it works.
[01:23:11.880 --> 01:23:14.880]  For all credit card debt, medical bills, even collection lawsuits.
[01:23:14.880 --> 01:23:16.880]  When I first joined, I was being sued.
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:22.880]  So I used the program methods, and after filing one piece of paper, the collection lawsuit was dismissed.
[01:23:22.880 --> 01:23:26.880]  With Zero Debt in 90 Days, your success is guaranteed in writing.
[01:23:26.880 --> 01:23:28.880]  There is no other program of its kind.

[01:23:53.880 --> 01:24:11.880]  All right, Wayne, finishing up with this.
[01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:16.880]  Specifically, what do you make of Obama talking about an international force invading?
[01:24:16.880 --> 01:24:20.880]  Do you think that's on the table with all those ships and task forces?
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:24.880]  Are there in the Mediterranean right off the coast, loitering about?
[01:24:24.880 --> 01:24:30.880]  And then expanding on that, how do you see this going just from your research?
[01:24:30.880 --> 01:24:36.880]  What are your different scenarios, and what's the larger geopolitical ramifications?
[01:24:36.880 --> 01:24:44.880]  Well, I think Obama, what he was doing, he's so late to the game on all these crises in these countries.
[01:24:44.880 --> 01:24:51.880]  He had to say something. He hadn't said anything about Libya.
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:59.880]  As far as the military action, the State Department could even organize a ferry for U.S. citizens trapped there, a ferry to Malta.
[01:24:59.880 --> 01:25:02.880]  Then it got trapped in Tripoli because of bad weather.
[01:25:02.880 --> 01:25:11.880]  So if they can't even organize a ferry ride for Americans, I doubt that they could do anything as far as any sort of military intervention.
[01:25:11.880 --> 01:25:17.880]  If that just spreads so thin, I'd be surprised his generals would even go along with that at this point in time,
[01:25:17.880 --> 01:25:20.880]  but an admiral in the case of the Navy.
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:25.880]  But I see what's going to happen is I think Gaddafi's days are numbered.
[01:25:25.880 --> 01:25:30.880]  If he doesn't commit suicide or he's not shot by one of his own officers,
[01:25:30.880 --> 01:25:33.880]  I think he'll probably go into one of the sub-Saharan African countries,
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:36.880]  which he's lavished with huge amounts of aid.
[01:25:36.880 --> 01:25:38.880]  He owns property in Zimbabwe.
[01:25:38.880 --> 01:25:45.880]  He may wind up there. He could very easily wind up in one of these other ten-horned dictatorships that he supported over the years.
[01:25:45.880 --> 01:25:48.880]  So any day now he could run to South Africa?
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:51.880]  He could go to South Africa. I don't know whether they want him there,
[01:25:51.880 --> 01:26:00.880]  but certainly Zimbabwe, Burkina Faso, Gambia, all run by dictators who Gaddafi has supported over the years and who like him.
[01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:04.880]  So he would be welcomed by those dictators, not by the people, certainly.
[01:26:04.880 --> 01:26:09.880]  I think as far as what's going to happen, I think he'll be replaced by,
[01:26:09.880 --> 01:26:12.880]  we know a number of his generals have defected.
[01:26:12.880 --> 01:26:19.880]  I think they'll wind up on some sort of temporary government national emergency,
[01:26:19.880 --> 01:26:26.880]  which will try to steady things out for Libya and try to decaddafiize the country,
[01:26:26.880 --> 01:26:30.880]  because his presence is everywhere in Libya.
[01:26:30.880 --> 01:26:37.880]  And I think as far as the next dominoes, Saudi Arabia, definitely, I think, is on the brink.
[01:26:37.880 --> 01:26:44.880]  I'm hearing from people in the Saudi opposition that they don't care about the king coming back and throwing money.
[01:26:44.880 --> 01:26:46.880]  They want him gone.
[01:26:46.880 --> 01:26:52.880]  They wish he had stayed in Morocco, where he supposedly was undergoing some sort of medical treatment.
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:54.880]  They don't want him back in Saudi Arabia.
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:27:01.880]  And the other thing is, look, after the royal family, there goes, don't even use the term.
[01:27:01.880 --> 01:27:03.880]  The country's name will change.
[01:27:03.880 --> 01:27:06.880]  The Saudis are the ruling family.
[01:27:06.880 --> 01:27:11.880]  The opposition certainly would not keep that name in the country's name.
[01:27:11.880 --> 01:27:15.880]  And I think we're talking more in terms of a democratic republic.
[01:27:15.880 --> 01:27:17.880]  And the country's only 100 years old.
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:18.880]  Absolutely.
[01:27:18.880 --> 01:27:21.880]  And it was originally two different countries.
[01:27:21.880 --> 01:27:26.880]  We have two million shias in the eastern province, where the oil is, for the most part.
[01:27:26.880 --> 01:27:28.880]  The refineries are there.
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:33.880]  They're seeing what's happening to the shias in Bahrain, who are a clear majority over there,
[01:27:33.880 --> 01:27:34.880]  and they don't like it.
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:42.880]  And they know that the Bahrain king and the Saudi king are, you know, mano-imano here on a lot of these issues.
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:48.880]  As a matter of fact, King Hamad of Bahrain welcomed King Abdullah back from Morocco and Saudi Arabia.
[01:27:48.880 --> 01:27:54.880]  I also think that in Yemen, we're going to see probably the solid regime fall there.
[01:27:54.880 --> 01:27:58.880]  And we'll see the restoration of the independence for South Yemen.
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:27:59.880]  It used to be independent.
[01:27:59.880 --> 01:28:05.880]  It was cobbled together with North Yemen, basically by the United States and other western countries.
[01:28:05.880 --> 01:28:08.880]  And South Yemeni has always felt messed over by that.
[01:28:08.880 --> 01:28:12.880]  So I think we're going to see the independence of South Yemen restored.
[01:28:12.880 --> 01:28:20.880]  As far as other, on the periphery, I think the king of Morocco is under a lot of pressure to give up some of his powers.
[01:28:20.880 --> 01:28:22.880]  We're going to see some movement there.
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:30.880]  King Abdullah of Jordan, of course, him and he and his father, who's saying, except that millions of dollars from the CIA,
[01:28:30.880 --> 01:28:33.880]  they're basically a U.S. puppet.
[01:28:33.880 --> 01:28:36.880]  I think he's going to be under a lot of pressure as well.
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:42.880]  And on the periphery, look for the regime in Djibouti where the U.S. has an NSA base and a military base.
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:46.880]  Look for that regime that's been there ever since independence in 1978.
[01:28:46.880 --> 01:28:49.880]  Look for that to go.
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:58.880]  Well, it's encouraging that you don't think that this is as big a threat as some do with some of the high tech and very deadly weapons that Qaddafi has.
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:08.880]  It sounds like you're leaning towards him fleeing instead of battling it out with nerve gas, though he said he's going to die on Libyan soil.
[01:29:08.880 --> 01:29:11.880]  I think it's a wild card, but we're going to go to break.
[01:29:11.880 --> 01:29:21.880]  I want to come back and ask why you think this isn't going as well as the globalist thought it would with these over throws and attempted destabilization campaigns that are still ongoing.
[01:29:21.880 --> 01:29:23.880]  Certainly the stock market has spoken.
[01:29:23.880 --> 01:29:27.880]  Certainly the oil markets and commodity markets have spoken.
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:32.880]  Medvedev over in Russia says look for decades of turmoil now in the Middle East.
[01:29:32.880 --> 01:29:42.880]  So a lot of people think this is really going to just get worse and worse, but we'll come back with you, Wayne, for a few more minutes and get your view on that.
[01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:45.880]  And why you think the globalist triggered this to begin with?
[01:29:45.880 --> 01:29:47.880]  I mean, what are they looking for?
[01:29:47.880 --> 01:29:48.880]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:50.880]  Wayne Madsen is our guest.
[01:29:50.880 --> 01:29:51.880]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.880 --> 01:29:53.880]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:53.880 --> 01:29:57.880]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:23.880 --> 01:30:30.880]  You can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.

[01:31:05.880 --> 01:31:08.880]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:13.880]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home.
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:19.880]  I've turned a tremendous influence on our president in Congress, and they really are calling the shots.
[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:24.880]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:31:24.880 --> 01:31:27.880]  Full of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:31:27.880 --> 01:31:34.880]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:31:34.880 --> 01:31:38.880]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches.
[01:31:38.880 --> 01:31:41.880]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:31:41.880 --> 01:31:43.880]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:48.880]  And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic.

[01:31:59.880 --> 01:32:04.880]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:32:04.880 --> 01:32:08.880]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:32:08.880 --> 01:32:14.880]  Number two, our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:19.880]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:32:19.880 --> 01:32:24.880]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:28.880]  And now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:32:28.880 --> 01:32:31.880]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:32:31.880 --> 01:32:35.880]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[01:32:35.880 --> 01:32:40.880]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:32:40.880 --> 01:32:43.880]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science.
[01:32:43.880 --> 01:32:45.880]  One of my oldest sponsors.

[01:33:08.880 --> 01:33:13.880]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[01:33:13.880 --> 01:33:39.880]  Extremism and defense of liberty is no vice.
[01:33:43.880 --> 01:33:46.880]  We do have Charlie Sheen, the big exclusive interview.
[01:33:46.880 --> 01:33:49.880]  Claring the air, telling the facts.
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:51.880]  Joining us coming up in the next hour.
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:55.880]  You can imagine there's a lot of big international media tuning in right now.
[01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:59.880]  So for those listening, it's coming up here in about 30 minutes.
[01:33:59.880 --> 01:34:06.880]  Now, we're talking about the serious geopolitical systems that are unfolding right now.
[01:34:06.880 --> 01:34:11.880]  Wayne, is there any doubt in your expert analysis
[01:34:11.880 --> 01:34:14.880]  that the underpinning of all these crises, though,
[01:34:14.880 --> 01:34:18.880]  is dollar devaluation and commodities going up in third world countries?
[01:34:18.880 --> 01:34:21.880]  As you know, most people spend about half or more of all of their money
[01:34:21.880 --> 01:34:25.880]  on heating oil, power, and food.
[01:34:25.880 --> 01:34:29.880]  And so whereas food prices going up here hurts Americans,
[01:34:29.880 --> 01:34:32.880]  but doesn't put most Americans on the streets.
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:35.880]  And there's something of a social welfare net here
[01:34:35.880 --> 01:34:38.880]  with 43 million plus Americans on food stamps.
[01:34:38.880 --> 01:34:42.880]  And the globalists have created that crisis and are now trying to trigger this domino effect.
[01:34:42.880 --> 01:34:46.880]  But what was their goal and why do you think they're failing?
[01:34:46.880 --> 01:34:49.880]  Because you mentioned that earlier, but I want to spend some more time on that.
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:53.880]  Well, I think the North African countries, like the European countries,
[01:34:53.880 --> 01:34:56.880]  especially those on the Mediterranean coast,
[01:34:56.880 --> 01:35:00.880]  are being hit by the same sort of austerity measures.
[01:35:00.880 --> 01:35:08.880]  World Bank IMF imposed measures which has driven up the cost of food,
[01:35:08.880 --> 01:35:14.880]  of gasoline, lots of unemployment amongst the young people.
[01:35:14.880 --> 01:35:19.880]  These are people with advanced degrees, college degrees,
[01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:21.880]  masters, and even PhDs.
[01:35:21.880 --> 01:35:25.880]  And that just triggers this type of revolt.
[01:35:25.880 --> 01:35:31.880]  And Libya was certainly no exception to this, as we saw with Tunisia and Egypt.
[01:35:31.880 --> 01:35:37.880]  I would note that Qaddafi today was blaming Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda
[01:35:37.880 --> 01:35:39.880]  for the revolt in Libya against them.
[01:35:39.880 --> 01:35:42.880]  My God, he sounds like George W. Bush,
[01:35:42.880 --> 01:35:47.880]  or when they got to pull the Al Qaeda rabbit out of the hat,
[01:35:47.880 --> 01:35:51.880]  he sounds like Obama or Napolitano and these people.
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:56.880]  But he's in full agreement with propaganda coming from his railing link website,
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:36:04.880]  saying that Al Qaeda and the Maghreb is all behind the rebellion against Qaddafi.
[01:36:04.880 --> 01:36:07.880]  So, you know, there's nonexistent bin Laden.
[01:36:07.880 --> 01:36:09.880]  He's citing him as a threat.
[01:36:09.880 --> 01:36:11.880]  I think he's desperate.
[01:36:11.880 --> 01:36:16.880]  He's using the same bookie man that W. has used in others in this country.
[01:36:16.880 --> 01:36:21.880]  And I think we will not be seeing Mr. Qaddafi around Libya.
[01:36:21.880 --> 01:36:27.880]  I would give him a matter of days, maybe a week, but no more than that.
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:34.880]  And you're predicting he'll run to Zimbabwe just north of South Africa?
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:37.880]  Yeah, he'll either go there or one of these other dictatorships
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:42.880]  where he's pumped a million, hundreds of millions,
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:45.880]  if not billions of dollars into propping up the regime.
[01:36:45.880 --> 01:36:51.880]  So, if he's not shot or he doesn't shoot himself, I think that.
[01:36:51.880 --> 01:36:52.880]  And I doubt he's good.
[01:36:52.880 --> 01:36:54.880]  Some people think he might commit suicide.
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:36:56.880]  The guy's incredibly vain.
[01:36:56.880 --> 01:37:01.880]  The Suitsi War were the best Italian-made suits you could find.
[01:37:01.880 --> 01:37:04.880]  The guy has really got a vanity issue.
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:06.880]  I doubt he would take his own life.
[01:37:06.880 --> 01:37:11.880]  I think he'll either run or they're going to grab him and spring him up.
[01:37:11.880 --> 01:37:15.880]  Why they put the British Foreign Ministry, as you noticed on Monday,
[01:37:15.880 --> 01:37:18.880]  put out the fact that he'd run to Venezuela and said that they'd confirmed it.
[01:37:18.880 --> 01:37:21.880]  Was that just to further destabilize him in the country?
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:23.880]  Possibly.
[01:37:23.880 --> 01:37:26.880]  Because Chavez basically said, look, we don't want him over here.
[01:37:26.880 --> 01:37:28.880]  I've got enough issues with the United States.
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:32.880]  I want to be accused of harboring Qaddafi on top of everything else.
[01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:37.880]  So, yeah, William Hague, of course, the British Foreign Secretary, is a real...
[01:37:37.880 --> 01:37:41.880]  You talk about anyone who's tied in with the CFR, that crowd,
[01:37:41.880 --> 01:37:44.880]  look no further than a guy like William Hague.
[01:37:44.880 --> 01:37:46.880]  I mean, he's really polished, but he's a consummate.
[01:37:46.880 --> 01:37:48.880]  He's a consummate liar.
[01:37:48.880 --> 01:37:50.880]  Wayne Madsen, briefly, and then we're going to let you go.
[01:37:50.880 --> 01:37:52.880]  WayneMadsenreport.com.
[01:37:52.880 --> 01:37:55.880]  Again, what do you see as the next big hotspots?
[01:37:55.880 --> 01:37:57.880]  Do you expect other countries to fall?
[01:37:57.880 --> 01:38:04.880]  I would watch Algeria, although that regime is being propped up by Sarkozy in France.
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:08.880]  I would look at Morocco. I don't think we're going to see hard falls there,
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:11.880]  like we saw in Tunisia, Egypt, and soon in Libya.
[01:38:11.880 --> 01:38:16.880]  Yemen, definitely, I think, is going to be a hard fall with the reemergence
[01:38:16.880 --> 01:38:20.880]  of independent South Yemen, North Yemen being independent as well.
[01:38:20.880 --> 01:38:28.880]  And Saudi Arabia, the opposition there is getting very well organized.
[01:38:28.880 --> 01:38:32.880]  Well, we just lost Wayne, his phone cut, but it was time for him to go.
[01:38:32.880 --> 01:38:35.880]  Thank you, Wayne Madsen, for joining us.
[01:38:35.880 --> 01:38:41.880]  Now, I'm going to premiere a special audio-video presentation that we put together
[01:38:41.880 --> 01:38:45.880]  in the last week, and we did this because a major magazine called
[01:38:45.880 --> 01:38:47.880]  and said they'd noticed these things.
[01:38:47.880 --> 01:38:51.880]  We actually went and did research and found out that, yes, indeed, it's true.
[01:38:51.880 --> 01:38:55.880]  Glenn Beck is basically copying everything on this show word for word,
[01:38:55.880 --> 01:38:58.880]  but then changing it and adding things to it.
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:02.880]  And it's important, as Glenn Beck is a phenomenon,
[01:39:02.880 --> 01:39:06.880]  I think he does quite a bit of good, but also some bad, to look at Glenn Beck.
[01:39:06.880 --> 01:39:09.880]  And so, up until the next break and the break after that,
[01:39:09.880 --> 01:39:17.880]  we are going to be premiering here Glenn Beck's Secret.
[01:39:17.880 --> 01:39:21.880]  And that's the article up on infowars.com, up on prisonpondet.com,
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:24.880]  if you're a radio listener and want to see the videos, see the exhibits,
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:30.880]  see the dates, we play where I say something years before or months before,
[01:39:30.880 --> 01:39:36.880]  and then he almost word for word says it on the same issue years or months later.
[01:39:36.880 --> 01:39:40.880]  And I also have sources inside Beck's operation, inside Fox,
[01:39:40.880 --> 01:39:43.880]  and I already know he's doing this, and he also tells people,
[01:39:43.880 --> 01:39:45.880]  people say, well, why are you bashing on Beck?
[01:39:45.880 --> 01:39:49.880]  Well, he tells people that are guests on his show just once he gets them from my show
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:51.880]  not to come on my show.
[01:39:51.880 --> 01:39:53.880]  I've been told that by a lot of people.
[01:39:53.880 --> 01:39:56.880]  Glenn Beck knows that he's basically ripped me off,
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:39:58.880]  so he wants to suppress me, and I'm tired of it.
[01:39:58.880 --> 01:40:04.880]  Here's the video.
[01:40:04.880 --> 01:40:05.880]  I'm a busy person.
[01:40:05.880 --> 01:40:07.880]  I have my own syndicated radio show.
[01:40:07.880 --> 01:40:09.880]  I produce documentary films.
[01:40:09.880 --> 01:40:11.880]  I do countless interviews.
[01:40:11.880 --> 01:40:15.880]  I don't have time to watch Glenn Beck.
[01:40:15.880 --> 01:40:19.880]  But because the national media has pointed out that Glenn Beck is ripping off
[01:40:19.880 --> 01:40:23.880]  the information I cover and then basically spinning it,
[01:40:23.880 --> 01:40:27.880]  I have been forced in the last year to monitor his radio show
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:29.880]  and to watch his television show off and on.
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:33.880]  Every time I watch him, I see incredible truths being brought out
[01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:36.880]  on national television and on syndicated radio,
[01:40:36.880 --> 01:40:39.880]  but with lies being injected into it.
[01:40:39.880 --> 01:40:42.880]  Media Matters and Newsweek, you name it,
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:47.880]  have all pointed out that Glenn Beck more and more echoes the information that I cover.
[01:40:47.880 --> 01:40:48.880]  But it's more than that.
[01:40:48.880 --> 01:40:50.880]  I have refused to sell out.
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:54.880]  I've been offered big TV deals and even bigger syndication radio deals,
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:58.880]  and I've said no because I was openly told I'd have to compromise my information.
[01:40:58.880 --> 01:41:00.880]  So I didn't sell out.
[01:41:00.880 --> 01:41:05.880]  So the system just takes an actor, a facsimile of what I am,
[01:41:05.880 --> 01:41:09.880]  and puts him forward so that he will compromise the information.
[01:41:09.880 --> 01:41:13.880]  So Glenn Beck goes from being this mainline Republican just three or four years ago
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:18.880]  who was admittedly getting marching orders at the White House from George W. Bush
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:21.880]  to the guy that's going to deliver us from world government.
[01:41:21.880 --> 01:41:25.880]  But if he was just taking my material and my research and my information
[01:41:25.880 --> 01:41:27.880]  and putting it out, I would be honored.
[01:41:27.880 --> 01:41:30.880]  Imitation is the most sincere form of flattery,
[01:41:30.880 --> 01:41:32.880]  but that's not what he's doing.
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:36.880]  This is Glenn Beck taking all the hardcore research I do,
[01:41:36.880 --> 01:41:42.880]  where I work 18 hours a day and even dream about this information when I'm asleep
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:45.880]  and I put it together with my team that bust their butt
[01:41:45.880 --> 01:41:49.880]  and then I watch him take it and twist it and manipulate it
[01:41:49.880 --> 01:41:55.880]  so they can control the left and the right in this synthesis setting up this world government.
[01:41:55.880 --> 01:41:59.880]  Now, recently I was called by one of the biggest magazines in the country
[01:41:59.880 --> 01:42:01.880]  who's doing a big piece on Glenn Beck,
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:06.880]  basically ripping off and spinning and twisting the information we cover in our research,
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:09.880]  and they said, well, we've all seen examples of him doing this,
[01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:12.880]  but can you send us five examples?
[01:42:12.880 --> 01:42:18.880]  Aaron and I put together a six-page document in just the last two days
[01:42:18.880 --> 01:42:20.880]  that is only the tip of the iceberg,
[01:42:20.880 --> 01:42:23.880]  and I'm only going to have time to cover a few of these.
[01:42:23.880 --> 01:42:29.880]  But you can see it for yourself that he doesn't just steal the information,
[01:42:29.880 --> 01:42:34.880]  he then degradates it, he then poisons it, he then spins it
[01:42:34.880 --> 01:42:37.880]  to where sometimes I get radio calls from new listeners
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:41.880]  or I see people on the street and they say, you're like Glenn Beck.
[01:42:41.880 --> 01:42:46.880]  Glenn Beck has been fighting the New World Order quote for just about two years.
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:49.880]  I've been fighting the New World Order for 16 years
[01:42:49.880 --> 01:42:54.880]  from a truly grassroots full-spectrum analysis point of view,
[01:42:54.880 --> 01:42:57.880]  not from a left-right system that is a control grid
[01:42:57.880 --> 01:43:00.880]  that the globalist used to divide the people.
[01:43:00.880 --> 01:43:05.880]  And it's painful to see my work being used and taken and twisted.
[01:43:05.880 --> 01:43:09.880]  Here's what's happening. If you read the Financial Times of London article
[01:43:09.880 --> 01:43:11.880]  with the headline, and now for World Government,
[01:43:11.880 --> 01:43:14.880]  where they admit it's unelected, it's authoritarian,
[01:43:14.880 --> 01:43:18.880]  but they say that it's good for you, media matters calls you a kook and a nut.
[01:43:18.880 --> 01:43:21.880]  And then Glenn Beck, he plays the part of the patriot
[01:43:21.880 --> 01:43:24.880]  who will admit that's going on, but then basically water it down.
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:29.880]  Well, now there's call for America to give up our dollar for a global currency
[01:43:29.880 --> 01:43:31.880]  that would lead to a global government.
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:38.880]  And one world currency and one world financial system is the endgame.
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:42.880]  Year after year, I had to sit there and watch Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:46.880]  and Fox News make fun of people that talked about a one-world government.
[01:43:46.880 --> 01:43:51.880]  The mainline right-wingers sat there as gatekeepers and told their sheeple viewers,
[01:43:51.880 --> 01:43:53.880]  don't listen to it, they're kooks, they're nuts.
[01:43:53.880 --> 01:43:58.880]  Now they've basically admitted all this is happening because we're so far down the line.
[01:43:58.880 --> 01:44:03.880]  Those people who have been yelling, oh, the UN's going to take over global government,
[01:44:03.880 --> 01:44:06.880]  they've been crazy, but now they're right.
[01:44:06.880 --> 01:44:12.880]  So here comes Glenn Beck telling you that world governments run by Van Jones and George Soros
[01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:14.880]  when they're mid-level players at best.
[01:44:14.880 --> 01:44:18.880]  It's disgusting. This is our future we're talking about.
[01:44:18.880 --> 01:44:23.880]  And the very Fox News that told conservatives what was kosher to look into
[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:31.880]  and what was not kosher to look into is now putting forward this prancing creature to be our leader
[01:44:31.880 --> 01:44:36.880]  so they can destroy him later to discredit our movement against world government.
[01:44:36.880 --> 01:44:41.880]  Google is allowed to do it because they were set up by MIT in the Central Intelligence Agency
[01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:45.880]  and they office out in their development firm out of the NASA complex.
[01:44:45.880 --> 01:44:50.880]  And we've had Mr. Steele and other CIA high-level agents on and technology to document
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:53.880]  who the people are at the CIA.
[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:58.880]  Glenn Beck has ripped us off on the Google boycott and then spun it deceptively.
[01:44:58.880 --> 01:45:02.880]  First of all, they are working really, really closely with the government.
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:06.880]  That's okay. They have a close relationship with the NSA.
[01:45:06.880 --> 01:45:12.880]  Okay, they're working way too close for my comfort with hardcore leftists.
[01:45:12.880 --> 01:45:17.880]  I'm really not sure that I want my search engine involved in government overthrows.
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:21.880]  Good or bad. He adds the proviso, one of many deceptive lies,
[01:45:21.880 --> 01:45:26.880]  that I'm not like the liberals who think that Bush was spying on him without warrants.
[01:45:26.880 --> 01:45:29.880]  I'm just mad at them because they're liberals.
[01:45:29.880 --> 01:45:33.880]  I'm not afraid that Google is reading my email or tapping your phone lines
[01:45:33.880 --> 01:45:35.880]  or stealing grandma's recipes.
[01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:41.880]  That kind of paranoia is reserved for the left during the Bush administration with Microsoft.
[01:45:41.880 --> 01:45:44.880]  He's telling conservatives you shouldn't be for the Fourth Amendment.
[01:45:44.880 --> 01:45:47.880]  That conservatives don't have that territory.
[01:45:47.880 --> 01:45:53.880]  He's ripped us off six months after we detailed that top Obama and former Clinton advisors
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:57.880]  were openly calling for a new Oklahoma City bombing to be blamed on domestic groups
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:45:59.880]  and to spike Obama's ratings.
[01:45:59.880 --> 01:46:02.880]  They are setting up another Oklahoma City.
[01:46:02.880 --> 01:46:07.880]  They are claiming that one is coming and they've already marked the one who caused it.
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:13.880]  He ripped us off months after we aired the exact same tapes that he later re-aired
[01:46:13.880 --> 01:46:18.880]  of the socialist eugenicist George Bernard Shaw talking about killing people
[01:46:18.880 --> 01:46:20.880]  who aren't useful to the New World Order.
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:22.880]  The Mussolini look.
[01:46:25.880 --> 01:46:27.880]  Lenny Howell Sittler.
[01:46:27.880 --> 01:46:29.880]  He does the fascist salute.
[01:46:29.880 --> 01:46:33.880]  He has condemned, although he is a most amiable man,
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:39.880]  he has condemned to go through life with that terrible and imposing expression
[01:46:39.880 --> 01:46:44.880]  He's amiable, he's good.
[01:46:49.880 --> 01:46:54.880]  In my documentary film Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, 2007,
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:58.880]  we detailed David Rockefeller's own memoir where he bragged that,
[01:46:58.880 --> 01:47:00.880]  yeah, I want world government.
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:06.880]  David Rockefeller admits in his own memoirs that he wants to destroy the United States.
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:12.880]  Len Beck later in November of 2010 covered the exact same quotes.
[01:47:12.880 --> 01:47:14.880]  There are hundreds of these examples.
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:17.880]  Some people even believe that we are part of a secret cabal,
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:21.880]  working against the best interests of the United States,
[01:47:21.880 --> 01:47:24.880]  characterizing my family and me as internationalists.
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:29.880]  If that's the charge, I stand guilty and I am proud of it.
[01:47:29.880 --> 01:47:32.880]  An article written by David Rockefeller for the New York Times.
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:36.880]  Rockefeller openly lauds and endorses Mao Zedong's actions
[01:47:36.880 --> 01:47:39.880]  while celebrating their command and control system.
[01:47:39.880 --> 01:47:44.880]  Communist China is the model planned society for the New World Order.
[01:47:44.880 --> 01:47:48.880]  This is what it's going to look like 2025, Global Landscaping.
[01:47:48.880 --> 01:47:51.880]  This is a government report.
[01:47:51.880 --> 01:47:58.880]  The model of China is the goal that these guys are saying everybody's pretty cool with.
[01:47:58.880 --> 01:48:00.880]  This is what's going to come.
[01:48:00.880 --> 01:48:05.880]  Months after I interview people like Damon Vickers or Gerald Salente,
[01:48:05.880 --> 01:48:09.880]  Glenn Beck has them on the show and asked them the exact same questions
[01:48:09.880 --> 01:48:12.880]  that we've posed on my broadcast.
[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:17.880]  In the last eight months, we've launched more than 70 successful Google bombs,
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:20.880]  where I tell my listeners to search key terms.
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:25.880]  Now suddenly in the last month, Glenn Beck has begun the Google bombs,
[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:28.880]  telling his listeners to search a certain term.
[01:48:28.880 --> 01:48:31.880]  Pause the show and look up the word caliphate.
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:33.880]  Here's the chart. Caliphate.
[01:48:33.880 --> 01:48:35.880]  Oh, by the way, we're on it.
[01:48:35.880 --> 01:48:39.880]  And then bragging on their site, we've got over 60 at number one,
[01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:44.880]  including three to four to five top terms in a row.
[01:48:44.880 --> 01:48:46.880]  Here's another example.
[01:48:46.880 --> 01:48:50.880]  In the last four years, since 2007, I have covered every week
[01:48:50.880 --> 01:48:53.880]  the Pentagon and the British Ministry of Defense drills
[01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:58.880]  and public reports they put out preparing for martial law
[01:48:58.880 --> 01:49:01.880]  during societal collapse due to economic crisis.
[01:49:01.880 --> 01:49:06.880]  Suddenly, Glenn Beck covers it almost word for word.
[01:49:06.880 --> 01:49:10.880]  If we have shortages of food, if we have rolling of blackouts,
[01:49:10.880 --> 01:49:13.880]  there could be civil unrest, there could be looting, riding,
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:16.880]  and that might be the impetus for the government to declare martial law.
[01:49:16.880 --> 01:49:19.880]  You know, I don't think you're a couple of years away from something like that.
[01:49:19.880 --> 01:49:23.880]  Of all these issues, there's one that really stands out,
[01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:28.880]  and that's the obscure issue of the federal government for over 35 years,
[01:49:28.880 --> 01:49:32.880]  having a secret program through the county health departments
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:37.880]  to take blood from all newborn babies for a secret DNA database.
[01:49:37.880 --> 01:49:40.880]  I broke this story more than 15 years ago.
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:43.880]  And after we pushed this out into the mainstream,
[01:49:43.880 --> 01:49:47.880]  Glenn Beck was the only major figure to pick up on it to his credit,
[01:49:47.880 --> 01:49:50.880]  but still the mainstream media then makes jokes about him
[01:49:50.880 --> 01:49:54.880]  and George Soros' run Media Matters says that he's making it up,
[01:49:54.880 --> 01:49:58.880]  even though the federal and state governments are losing lawsuits over it.
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:01.880]  And then there's other examples, things that actually make me question
[01:50:01.880 --> 01:50:03.880]  if Glenn Beck is a good guy or a bad guy.
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:06.880]  Maybe he could be a good guy, trying to work through the system,
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:10.880]  because I've challenged him, cover John P. Holdren,
[01:50:10.880 --> 01:50:13.880]  the White House science czar, calling for sterilants in the water.
[01:50:13.880 --> 01:50:19.880]  Which one of us actually says, I want to breathe in dirty air and drink dirty water?
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:21.880]  You know, the kind with sterilants in it.
[01:50:21.880 --> 01:50:25.880]  Cover the eugenicist, cover the move for a world government.
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:30.880]  The only way to really stop their imagined disaster to save the planet
[01:50:30.880 --> 01:50:33.880]  is to limit the number of human beings on this planet.
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:38.880]  All right, again, I get Matt at Beck because he does things like
[01:50:38.880 --> 01:50:41.880]  tell people that I have his guests on to come on my show and other things
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:43.880]  and rip our material off and twist it.
[01:50:43.880 --> 01:50:46.880]  We're going to come back and finish up with the rest of Glenn Beck's secret.
[01:50:46.880 --> 01:50:50.880]  Then coming up eight after next hour, Charlie Sheen live.
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:51:19.880]  Stay with us, ladies and gentlemen. The transmission will continue.

[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:03.880]  The largest part of gaining radiant health is detoxification.

[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:10.880]  and even take lots of quality supplements and, in many instances, only make minimal progress.
[01:53:10.880 --> 01:53:15.880]  What is the key to detoxifying your body of mercury, heavy metals, chemicals and drugs?
[01:53:15.880 --> 01:53:16.880]  It is glutathione.
[01:53:16.880 --> 01:53:20.880]  Glutathione is the master antioxidant used to detoxify your entire body.
[01:53:20.880 --> 01:53:24.880]  It stops free radicals, keeps sales young and reduces inflammation.

[01:53:30.880 --> 01:53:34.880]  One-world-way is more effective than any other-way protein powder on the market
[01:53:34.880 --> 01:53:37.880]  because it is unheated and from grass-fed cows.
[01:53:37.880 --> 01:53:44.880]  All other, quote, cold-processed-way protein powders have been heated and damaged by 15% or more.
[01:53:44.880 --> 01:53:46.880]  One-world-way comes in three delicious flavors.

[01:53:58.880 --> 01:54:05.880]  The only way to really stop their imagined disaster to save the planet
[01:54:05.880 --> 01:54:09.880]  is to limit the number of human beings on this planet.
[01:54:09.880 --> 01:54:13.880]  One child per family, that's negative population growth.
[01:54:13.880 --> 01:54:16.880]  I'm against it and I think I'm not alone.
[01:54:16.880 --> 01:54:20.880]  And then weeks later, he covers it word for word.
[01:54:20.880 --> 01:54:24.880]  But then he always doubles back with spin and deception.
[01:54:24.880 --> 01:54:28.880]  Glenn Beck is like orange juice.
[01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:32.880]  It's nutritious. It's delicious.
[01:54:32.880 --> 01:54:36.880]  But I didn't tell you the rest of what Glenn Beck is.
[01:54:36.880 --> 01:54:43.880]  He's a teaspoon of cyanide enough to kill 10 elephants in every pitcher.
[01:54:43.880 --> 01:54:45.880]  And that's it. That's what's so bad about him.
[01:54:45.880 --> 01:54:47.880]  You see the orange juice? It's sitting on the counter.
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:49.880]  You pour it in your glass.
[01:54:49.880 --> 01:54:54.880]  It's like you're asking, hey, Google's NSA, hey, Google's overthrowing countries to put radical Muslims in?
[01:54:54.880 --> 01:54:59.880]  He doesn't tell you so the military industrial complex has somebody to basically bomb.
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:03.880]  He gets your confidence with the truth, with that glass of orange juice,
[01:55:03.880 --> 01:55:05.880]  and he puts a teaspoon of poison in it.
[01:55:05.880 --> 01:55:06.880]  It's unbelievable.
[01:55:06.880 --> 01:55:08.880]  The guy's a complete snake.
[01:55:08.880 --> 01:55:12.880]  When you watch it, it's such 21st century high-tech propaganda,
[01:55:12.880 --> 01:55:19.880]  clearly with psych warfare chiefs with psi op degrees black ops loading those
[01:55:19.880 --> 01:55:25.440]  teleprompters it is so evil I don't like my identity being stolen and then I
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:31.800]  don't like somebody in my name in my mission twisting what I've done I end up
[01:55:31.800 --> 01:55:35.400]  having mainstream media attack me constantly saying I'm the little Glenn
[01:55:35.400 --> 01:55:42.580]  Beck no I'm not the little Glenn Beck I'm up towards the fount I'm up the
[01:55:42.580 --> 01:55:47.200]  river where the water came from not downstream where Glenn Beck is
[01:55:47.200 --> 01:55:52.560]  basically urinating into the truth let's get that straight do you know what
[01:55:52.560 --> 01:55:56.200]  it's like to pour your heart and soul out to be death-threaded to be
[01:55:56.200 --> 01:56:03.080]  physically attacked to not go along with the payoff sellout offers and then to
[01:56:03.080 --> 01:56:07.280]  feel good and to have integrity and then to see somebody come along and
[01:56:07.280 --> 01:56:11.960]  basically as an actor rip off the information you're covering and then
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:16.240]  adulterated we're in a fight for the heart and soul of this country the Tea
[01:56:16.240 --> 01:56:20.680]  Party started by the Ron Paul movement in 2007 has been partially co-op by the
[01:56:20.680 --> 01:56:25.100]  neocons the Tea Party Coalition in Congress won Ed and voted for the
[01:56:25.100 --> 01:56:28.720]  Patriot Act we were sent by law enforcement two years ago the internal
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:32.000]  government documents my home land security where there's nothing to do
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:35.780]  with men in caves it's all about the American people gun owners libertarians
[01:56:35.780 --> 01:56:40.040]  conservatives if the people don't get wise to Glenn Beck we don't have any
[01:56:40.040 --> 01:56:45.280]  future I mean it's really just that simple but the fact that he has to
[01:56:45.280 --> 01:56:50.960]  mimic us and take on our political colorations is camouflage does show how
[01:56:50.960 --> 01:56:54.960]  far we've come we have a global government run by private banking
[01:56:54.960 --> 01:56:59.960]  cartels that's taken over our nation and Glenn we cannot allow you to blame it
[01:56:59.960 --> 01:57:04.520]  all on a mid-level nobody like Van Jones and tell us he's the top of the
[01:57:04.520 --> 01:57:08.840]  pyramid Glenn I'll really start to believe in you when you do a show on
[01:57:08.840 --> 01:57:13.000]  Rupert Murdoch admittedly being one of the key people behind the move for
[01:57:13.000 --> 01:57:17.720]  global carbon taxes to fund this new private world government and I want to
[01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:21.440]  tell the global is something you think Glenn Beck's co-opted my message in my
[01:57:21.440 --> 01:57:26.280]  information no this door swings both ways this is a two-way street a double-edged
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:30.760]  sword we're only getting more viewers and more listeners because they're going
[01:57:30.760 --> 01:57:37.000]  back people are using him as a doorway and then they're finding the real
[01:57:37.000 --> 01:57:42.320]  bonafide information so in the end it's like God says in the Bible no weapon
[01:57:42.320 --> 01:57:47.600]  formed against us shall prosper you give us lemons we're gonna make lemonade it's
[01:57:47.600 --> 01:57:54.040]  just that I get more angry at Beck than like an evil Mr. Maddow or slime ball in
[01:57:54.040 --> 01:57:59.520]  MSNBC because they are willing open servants of evil and you're over here
[01:57:59.520 --> 01:58:04.080]  posing so you can basically fill the chair of the Liberty Movement so that
[01:58:04.080 --> 01:58:08.600]  you can basically co-opt us in the end but then I think back to Mr. Maddow and
[01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:14.000]  I think back to even Keith Oberman back when Bush was in office they talk about
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:17.800]  Patriot Act and torture and evil and corruption and now they don't really do
[01:58:17.800 --> 01:58:22.640]  it because they were playing the part of anti-establishment when Bush was in now
[01:58:22.640 --> 01:58:27.320]  that they see their wing as being in power of the same bird of prey they're
[01:58:27.320 --> 01:58:31.280]  playing the part of the establishment but I know you guys think you can spin it
[01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:35.640]  later and you only care about this cycle and the next election coming up and
[01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:41.760]  they'll have a new flim flam man by then but cycles are getting

[02:00:05.000 --> 02:00:09.520]  House had no intention of making public President Bush was told in August that
[02:00:09.520 --> 02:00:13.480]  Osama bin Laden might be planning an attack involving the hijack could have

[02:00:44.120 --> 02:00:49.960]  building seven freefall collapse well no there's number seven coming down the
[02:00:49.960 --> 02:00:54.520]  excitement and the fun that people get watching an old building being
[02:00:54.520 --> 02:00:57.560]  demolished and they wired very carefully for days and it's a very careful
[02:00:57.560 --> 02:01:02.880]  operate third time today it's reminiscent of those pictures we've all seen too much
[02:01:02.880 --> 02:01:06.680]  of television before when a building was deliberately destroyed destroyed by
[02:01:06.680 --> 02:01:11.880]  well-placed dynamite to knock it down this one of things to us is pulling they
[02:01:11.880 --> 02:01:17.200]  made that decision to pull and then we watch the building Jane what more can
[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:20.880]  you tell us about the Salomon brothers building and its collapse well only
[02:01:20.880 --> 02:01:24.600]  really what you already know details of very very sketchy you're getting
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:28.720]  information now that one of the other buildings building seven in the World
[02:01:28.720 --> 02:01:35.200]  Trade Center complex is on fire and has either collapsed or is collapsing
[02:01:35.200 --> 02:01:43.720]  my close-up inspection there's no evidence of a plane having crashed
[02:01:43.720 --> 02:01:48.640]  anywhere near the Pentagon the only site is the actual side of the building
[02:01:48.640 --> 02:01:53.360]  that's crashed in and as I said the only pieces left that you can see are small
[02:01:53.360 --> 02:01:57.600]  enough that you could pick up in your hand there are no large tail sections
[02:01:57.600 --> 02:02:02.400]  wing sections a fuselage nothing like that anywhere around which would indicate
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:06.120]  that the entire plane crashed into the side of the Pentagon
[02:02:06.120 --> 02:02:13.360]  firefighters and police describing explosions a lot of them
[02:02:24.480 --> 02:02:29.640]  even if there was no secondary explosives in the building
[02:02:29.640 --> 02:02:34.140]  gunfire you know bang bang bang bang and then and then all of a sudden three big
[02:02:34.140 --> 02:02:37.220]  explosions. Do you know if it was an explosion or if it was a building
[02:02:37.220 --> 02:02:43.540]  collapse? To me it sounded like it's to me it sounded like an explosion. Chief
[02:02:43.540 --> 02:02:48.780]  Albert Turry told me that he tried to get his men out as quickly as he could but
[02:02:48.780 --> 02:02:52.500]  he said that there was another explosion which took place and then an hour
[02:02:52.500 --> 02:03:00.080]  after there was a another explosion in one of the towers here.
[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:06.060]  Sebel Edmonds, FBI translator, breaking her gag order. All our intimate
[02:03:06.060 --> 02:03:11.460]  relationship with Bin Laden and Taliban, we did carry very intimate
[02:03:11.460 --> 02:03:17.180]  relationship with these people only up to September 11. Bin Laden was spirited
[02:03:17.180 --> 02:03:21.700]  into this military hospital in Rawa Pendi for kidney dialysis treatment. The
[02:03:21.700 --> 02:03:25.460]  military had him surrounded they were saying that Osama Bin Laden had to be
[02:03:25.460 --> 02:03:34.460]  watched carefully and looked after. Nor had, standing down, where were the planes?
[02:03:35.620 --> 02:03:39.780]  On now to one of the eeriest moments amid the carnage of 9-11 a mysterious
[02:03:39.780 --> 02:03:43.540]  plane was seen flying right over the president's residence. The E-4B is over
[02:03:43.540 --> 02:03:48.100]  New York and Washington otherwise known as the Tuesday planes. He's never been
[02:03:48.100 --> 02:03:54.420]  officially explained. Cell phones working at impossible altitudes.
[02:03:54.420 --> 02:04:00.380]  Solicitor General Ted Olson receiving phone calls at the FBI says were never
[02:04:00.380 --> 02:04:04.180]  made. What happened during that call? This is the only information we have on
[02:04:04.180 --> 02:04:10.940]  these terrorists. She was able to call him twice. How she could pull that off? We
[02:04:10.940 --> 02:04:16.300]  don't know what she did. These are the questions Mr. President. These are the
[02:04:16.300 --> 02:04:21.060]  questions. They go on and on.
[02:04:22.580 --> 02:04:28.100]  Good afternoon Mr. President. I come to you today representing the families of
[02:04:28.100 --> 02:04:33.580]  the victims of September 11th as well as millions of my fellow Americans.
[02:04:33.580 --> 02:04:38.700]  Hopefully by now you've had a chance to read my letter to you 20 minutes with
[02:04:38.700 --> 02:04:45.180]  the president and if not at least that its contents brought to your attention. We
[02:04:45.180 --> 02:04:51.300]  have questions Mr. President. Lots of questions. A lot of them are detailed in
[02:04:51.300 --> 02:04:57.420]  my letter. But trust me they are in your hands.
[02:05:00.420 --> 02:05:04.740]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over. It
[02:05:04.740 --> 02:05:09.780]  ended on June of 2009. The millions of Americans unable to find work might not
[02:05:09.780 --> 02:05:13.860]  agree. Perhaps the recession ended for the bankers and government employees but
[02:05:13.860 --> 02:05:17.500]  for the rest of us things seemed to be getting worse. Gold and silver haven't
[02:05:17.500 --> 02:05:21.220]  heard the news either. They've begun their long expected journey to the moon.
[02:05:21.220 --> 02:05:25.020]  In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver you
[02:05:25.020 --> 02:05:28.740]  should consider a food savings account from eFoods Direct. They both make

[02:06:19.260 --> 02:06:23.580]  proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded
[02:06:23.580 --> 02:06:27.940]  nationwide. This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program

[02:06:41.700 --> 02:06:46.260]  staged terror and cameras on every street corner. It's only the beginning of
[02:06:46.260 --> 02:06:51.220]  the New World Order's hellish plan. The police state isn't coming. It's here.

[02:08:59.060 --> 02:09:04.180]  Well, Charlie Sheen, you haven't been back with us since about a year and a few
[02:09:04.180 --> 02:09:08.980]  months ago with your message to President Obama, your 20 minutes with the
[02:09:08.980 --> 02:09:13.700]  president that we just re-heared before you joined us. It's great to have you,
[02:09:13.700 --> 02:09:21.860]  Charlie. It's still topical. It's a timeless message. It's still right
[02:09:21.860 --> 02:09:27.260]  there in the fold. Well, it certainly is. What's your message to President Obama
[02:09:27.260 --> 02:09:33.060]  refusing to answer the bullet points that you put down in that key document of
[02:09:33.060 --> 02:09:36.180]  the questions surrounding the tragic attacks of 9-11?
[02:09:36.180 --> 02:09:44.100]  Well, I would say to BO, like how much faith can I possibly have in you to run this
[02:09:44.100 --> 02:09:49.380]  entire country when 20 questions from a high school dropout sitcom actor
[02:09:49.380 --> 02:09:53.180]  appeared to be too much to handle for you and your staff? It's like you've had
[02:09:53.180 --> 02:09:57.660]  almost two years to deal with this. I wrote them in one hour and it's like,
[02:09:57.660 --> 02:10:02.980]  you know, sorry, but you, sir, are obviously a coward and a cheap suit.
[02:10:02.980 --> 02:10:06.900]  And bottom line, Alex, is I'm still here. His schedule is public knowledge.
[02:10:06.900 --> 02:10:12.420]  It's rocket science. This is not. Quit hiding. It's embarrassing, dude. Next subject.
[02:10:12.420 --> 02:10:16.380]  Well, just briefly getting back to Obama for a moment. We did a lot of research
[02:10:16.380 --> 02:10:20.060]  for those 20 questions. Things like Mr. President, six of the 10 commissioners
[02:10:20.060 --> 02:10:24.260]  and most of the lawyers on the 9-11 commission say that the official story
[02:10:24.260 --> 02:10:28.860]  is a lie. Please respond to this or why did building seven fall at freefall
[02:10:28.860 --> 02:10:34.300]  speed? Please respond to this, but they don't want to respond to it. Yeah. Well,
[02:10:34.300 --> 02:10:38.260]  I think just, um, I think somebody is running at him right now with a,
[02:10:38.260 --> 02:10:41.780]  with a, with a tape recording of what I just spoke and said, they're, they're
[02:10:41.780 --> 02:10:47.060]  on to us, man. He's back. We thought he was dead. Nice try, fellas.
[02:10:47.060 --> 02:10:50.900]  Enough of that. Enough of that. They, they, they know the score on that. Let's get
[02:10:50.900 --> 02:10:53.780]  the more, you know, contemporary stuff. Cause just, you know, what's going on in
[02:10:53.780 --> 02:10:58.660]  people are so, you know, mystified by this, uh, this, this, this, this odyssey
[02:10:58.660 --> 02:11:03.100]  that, that, that, that refuses to stop calling itself Charlie Sheen. Absolutely.
[02:11:03.100 --> 02:11:06.620]  Charlie, it was good to see you a few weeks ago at your home. You are, you are
[02:11:06.620 --> 02:11:10.700]  looking, you are looking great. You're completely clean, aren't you? 100%. You
[02:11:10.700 --> 02:11:14.020]  know, here's your first P test. Next one goes in your mouth. No, you won't get
[02:11:14.020 --> 02:11:19.620]  high. It's all good. It's all good guys. Quit panicking. Quit panicking. No panic.
[02:11:19.620 --> 02:11:25.620]  No judgment. And you're working out even a couple times a day sometimes. Um, well,
[02:11:25.620 --> 02:11:30.940]  yeah, but there's only one time in the gym, if you take my drift, Alex, however,
[02:11:30.980 --> 02:11:35.260]  we're not live, are we? No, we're live. Charlie, uh, speaking of that, the media,
[02:11:35.660 --> 02:11:38.980]  uh, you don't want to go there. You don't want to ever defend yourself, but you've
[02:11:38.980 --> 02:11:43.180]  told me privately, most of the stuff, most of the names, it's, it's, it's not
[02:11:43.180 --> 02:11:47.780]  true, but what is going on, uh, with the women in your life?
[02:11:47.980 --> 02:11:52.660]  The goddesses, Alex, the goddesses, um, let me just say this about the goddesses.
[02:11:52.660 --> 02:11:57.700]  I don't believe the term is, uh, is good enough, is good enough. Um, when you're
[02:11:57.700 --> 02:12:01.580]  bound by these, uh, these, these terrestrial descriptions, you must use
[02:12:01.580 --> 02:12:05.180]  the best choice available, right? Yes. So if you think about it, dude, it's like,
[02:12:05.180 --> 02:12:10.300]  I'm over three with marriage, uh, with narrowing excuse, but, but like in
[02:12:10.300 --> 02:12:15.220]  baseball, the scoreboard doesn't lie, never has. So what, what we all have,
[02:12:15.220 --> 02:12:20.540]  um, is a, is a marriage of the heart of the hearts. And I, you know, to, to,
[02:12:20.540 --> 02:12:25.860]  to sully contaminate her, you know, um, or radically, uh, disrespect this
[02:12:25.860 --> 02:12:29.660]  union with the shameful contract is something I will, yeah, you know,
[02:12:29.660 --> 02:12:35.380]  lead to the amateurs and the Bible grippers, the Bible grippers. And then
[02:12:35.380 --> 02:12:39.420]  I just got to add this, there was a whole firestorm yesterday about, about
[02:12:39.420 --> 02:12:44.380]  Brooke being, uh, you know, a part of our, a part of our crew and this, let me
[02:12:44.380 --> 02:12:48.340]  just say this, this is all I'm going to say about it was, is that, uh, where
[02:12:48.340 --> 02:12:52.740]  there were four, um, there are now three, but my brook and good luck in your
[02:12:52.740 --> 02:12:59.380]  travels, you're going to need it badly. So, so Brooke did go along with you,
[02:12:59.380 --> 02:13:03.580]  but she's not there now. No, she's not there now. And, and, and, and we are,
[02:13:03.580 --> 02:13:09.820]  and I don't know winning anyone rhymes with winning anyone. Yeah, that would
[02:13:09.820 --> 02:13:14.860]  be us. Sorry, man. Didn't make the rules. Oops. Well, well, Charlie, I've known
[02:13:14.860 --> 02:13:19.820]  you for six, six and a half years or so. And I knew you were completely clean.
[02:13:20.100 --> 02:13:23.900]  Uh, and then I've known you since, but, but the point is now I've never seen
[02:13:23.900 --> 02:13:28.180]  you when I was out at your house and talking on the phone so energized as
[02:13:28.180 --> 02:13:33.580]  you are now. I mean, you, uh, I mean, you're on fire, uh, as nails, uh, told
[02:13:33.580 --> 02:13:35.740]  the news yesterday. I mean, I agree with that description.
[02:13:36.980 --> 02:13:39.860]  Well, I think it was nails that said I was really, really flattered because he
[02:13:39.860 --> 02:13:42.700]  got it right. That I'm not, you know, he might be nails, but I'm fricking
[02:13:42.740 --> 02:13:47.260]  bayonets, you know, I am battle tested bayonets, bro. And I'm, you know, I'm,
[02:13:47.420 --> 02:13:51.580]  I'm, I'm tired. I am so tired of pretending like my life isn't perfect
[02:13:51.580 --> 02:13:55.780]  and bitching and just winning every second. And I'm not perfect and bitching
[02:13:55.780 --> 02:13:59.340]  and just delivering the goods at every fricking turn because look what I'm
[02:13:59.340 --> 02:14:03.100]  dealing with, man. I'm dealing with fools and trolls, you know, dealing with
[02:14:03.100 --> 02:14:07.100]  soft targets. And it's just, you know, it's, it's just strafing runs in my
[02:14:07.100 --> 02:14:10.260]  underwear before my first cup of coffee because I don't have time for these
[02:14:10.260 --> 02:14:14.700]  clowns. I don't have time for their judgment and their stupidity and, you
[02:14:14.700 --> 02:14:17.660]  know, they lay down with their ugly wives in front of their ugly children and
[02:14:17.660 --> 02:14:20.860]  just look at their loser lives and then they'll give me and they say, I can't
[02:14:20.860 --> 02:14:24.620]  process it. Well, no, and you never will stop trying. Just sit back and enjoy
[02:14:24.620 --> 02:14:30.380]  the show. You know, wow, I am, I am speechless. Later, we're going to get
[02:14:30.380 --> 02:14:33.820]  into apocalypse now, but what comes to mind is when we were there a few weeks
[02:14:33.820 --> 02:14:38.380]  ago watching it in your home theater, uh, when Colonel Kurtz is saying, you
[02:14:38.380 --> 02:14:43.660]  can, you can, you can kill me, but you can't kill me, but you do not have the
[02:14:43.660 --> 02:14:48.140]  right to judge me. Boom. That's the whole movie. That's life. That's life.
[02:14:48.140 --> 02:14:51.860]  There's, there's, there's nobility in that there's focus. It's genuine. It's
[02:14:51.860 --> 02:14:56.260]  crystal and it's pure and it's available to everybody. You've got your traps and
[02:14:56.260 --> 02:14:59.820]  put down your McDonald's, your vaccine, your rush weekly, your TMZ and the rest of
[02:14:59.820 --> 02:15:04.100]  it, you know, and focus on something that matters, but you can't focus on
[02:15:04.100 --> 02:15:08.820]  things that matter if, if, if, if all you've been is asleep for 40 years. Funny
[02:15:08.820 --> 02:15:13.540]  how sleep runs with sheep, you know? Anyway, we're getting off topic. No,
[02:15:13.540 --> 02:15:17.900]  Charlie, I mean, I mean, is it? We don't care anymore, Alex. We don't care. Is it
[02:15:17.900 --> 02:15:20.300]  fair to talk about this work thing, bro? Let's get to the work business because
[02:15:20.300 --> 02:15:24.140]  there's been a lot of speculation, a lot of rumors. Imagine that with the media.
[02:15:24.140 --> 02:15:28.580]  Well, sure. Let's go over that because when I was there two weeks ago at your
[02:15:28.580 --> 02:15:33.220]  house, you look great, totally clean. You were working out super hard. I went and
[02:15:33.220 --> 02:15:37.500]  worked out with you at that private gym. I mean, they put you through an
[02:15:37.500 --> 02:15:42.060]  incredible workout. You know, you're there exercising in the pool later and
[02:15:42.060 --> 02:15:46.100]  you're saying, look, I'm ready to go to work. I'm ready to go right now. And then
[02:15:46.100 --> 02:15:49.220]  they add the lie that, oh, you don't have a hernia. Well, you know what? I've seen
[02:15:49.220 --> 02:15:53.980]  your hernia. I've got the same hernia in my belly button and your hernia
[02:15:53.980 --> 02:15:57.380]  was hurt. But again, you don't want to defend yourself on that and, you know,
[02:15:57.380 --> 02:16:01.940]  tell folks the truth about it. But the point is, is that it seems like there's
[02:16:01.940 --> 02:16:06.820]  some people in your life that are trying to demonize you. They're doing these
[02:16:06.820 --> 02:16:10.740]  vanity cards, talking about how they're gonna outlive you. It seems pretty darn
[02:16:10.740 --> 02:16:14.260]  aggressive. Yeah, I didn't care about that vanity card. In fact, I went straight
[02:16:14.260 --> 02:16:17.500]  home with that one and just dispelled that. And that was actually, you know, one of
[02:16:17.500 --> 02:16:22.460]  the few compliments that clown has paid me in fricking almost a decade. But I'm
[02:16:22.460 --> 02:16:27.260]  excited to get back to work and not to completely discount what you just
[02:16:27.260 --> 02:16:32.220]  talked about. It's just if I bring up these turds, these little
[02:16:32.220 --> 02:16:38.420]  harmoniously losers, there's no reason to then bring them back into the
[02:16:38.420 --> 02:16:42.540]  fold because I have real fame. They have nothing. They have zero. They
[02:16:42.540 --> 02:16:47.100]  have that night. I will forget about them as the last image of them
[02:16:47.100 --> 02:16:51.580]  exits my beautiful home. And they will get out there and they will sell me and
[02:16:51.580 --> 02:16:54.740]  then they will lose. And they will lose the rest of their lives as they think
[02:16:54.740 --> 02:16:59.540]  about me and my life the rest of their life. So, it's just, it's no, it's, again,
[02:16:59.540 --> 02:17:04.340]  bring me a challenge somebody. Bring me a fricking challenge because, you know, it
[02:17:04.340 --> 02:17:10.060]  just ain't there. But you're ready to go back to work right now. Well, yeah, but
[02:17:10.060 --> 02:17:14.260]  but now I'm tired of being told like, oh, you can't talk about that.
[02:17:14.260 --> 02:17:20.340]  Okay, can't talk about that. Mole, S, H, I, T, it's got, let me just say this, it's
[02:17:20.340 --> 02:17:25.620]  nothing. Yeah, this is out of deplorable at a certain time.
[02:17:25.620 --> 02:17:30.260]  Yeah, that's Chuck's real name. Miss took this rock star for his own selfish
[02:17:30.260 --> 02:17:35.220]  exit strategy, bro. Check it, Alex. I embarrassed him in front of his children
[02:17:35.220 --> 02:17:39.940]  in the world by healing at a pace that his unevolved mind cannot process.
[02:17:39.940 --> 02:17:45.580]  Okay, last night check time. I've spent, I think, close to the last decade, I don't
[02:17:45.580 --> 02:17:50.620]  know, effortlessly and magically converting your, your tin cans into pure gold. And
[02:17:50.620 --> 02:17:55.060]  the gratitude I get in this, get is this, is this, Charleston chose not to do his
[02:17:55.060 --> 02:17:59.220]  job, which is to write. Clearly someone who believes he is above the law. Well,
[02:17:59.220 --> 02:18:04.740]  you've been mourned, dude. Bring it. Charlie, everybody that I know that knows
[02:18:04.740 --> 02:18:09.060]  you and I, and I know you well, talks about how behind the scenes you give
[02:18:09.060 --> 02:18:12.660]  incredible amounts of money to charity. You help people, you give things to
[02:18:12.660 --> 02:18:16.900]  everybody. You, you know, you go out and help firemen and schoolchildren. I mean,
[02:18:16.900 --> 02:18:21.300]  you, but genuinely are a nice guy, but you've always just let people attack you
[02:18:21.300 --> 02:18:24.580]  and lie about you. And in the years I've known you and in the years, people that
[02:18:24.580 --> 02:18:29.380]  have known you for decades, they say Charlie is on fire. And after he came
[02:18:29.380 --> 02:18:34.500]  out of what he's been in the last seven months, he is, he is not putting up with
[02:18:34.500 --> 02:18:37.540]  people trying to push him around anymore. Is that fair to say?
[02:18:37.540 --> 02:18:42.340]  It's, it's, yeah, it's an understatement. You know, it's, I just, I'm sorry, man.
[02:18:42.340 --> 02:18:45.460]  I got, I got, I got magic and I got poetry at my fingertips and I'm, you
[02:18:45.460 --> 02:18:50.420]  know, at most of the time, and this is, you know, this includes naps. You know,
[02:18:50.420 --> 02:18:54.340]  I'm, I'm, I'm an F 18, bro. And I will, I will destroy you in the air and I will,
[02:18:54.340 --> 02:18:58.420]  I will, I will deploy my ordinance to the ground. Are you going to announce your
[02:18:58.420 --> 02:19:04.020]  new tattoo here on air? Yeah, why not? Because it's just a pure, pure and
[02:19:04.020 --> 02:19:10.900]  complete gnarly isms. Um, yeah, I sat with two, uh, hey coincidence, F 18,
[02:19:10.900 --> 02:19:16.420]  the top gun radical fire napalm dropping pilots in my movie theater, watching
[02:19:16.420 --> 02:19:20.500]  the attack sequence that did the chopper attack sequence on the beach head
[02:19:20.500 --> 02:19:24.740]  to go surfing because they wanted to and those people were in their way.
[02:19:24.740 --> 02:19:29.780]  Um, and I, and I was getting a tattoo during the, the, the, the, the death from
[02:19:29.780 --> 02:19:34.580]  above and it was a, uh, it's the banner from the death card that, that Kilgore
[02:19:34.580 --> 02:19:39.300]  is throwing on his victims, but there's also falling from it is the, uh,
[02:19:39.300 --> 02:19:43.460]  is the apple from the giving tree. There's my life deal with it. Oh wait, can't
[02:19:43.460 --> 02:19:49.220]  process it. Losers winning. Goodbye. When are we going to see this tattoo?
[02:19:49.220 --> 02:19:54.660]  Uh, well, if my man, um, if my man Steve is listening, I'm sure he'll be, he'll
[02:19:54.660 --> 02:20:00.660]  be, uh, it'll be headed to you and, and, and, uh, you know, just a matter of moments.
[02:20:00.660 --> 02:20:03.300]  Well, that's awesome. Charlie, I know you've got some surprises coming up in
[02:20:03.300 --> 02:20:07.060]  the next few weeks, but we'll let you roll those surprises out.
[02:20:07.060 --> 02:20:13.460]  Moving on along here, a major league three or other two were giant hits and, uh,
[02:20:13.460 --> 02:20:16.980]  I knew the inside baseball of some of the planning, uh, for that. You told me about
[02:20:16.980 --> 02:20:20.100]  it a while back, but now it looks like it's really starting to come together.
[02:20:20.100 --> 02:20:23.700]  Tell us about, uh, when we're going to be looking for major league three and who's
[02:20:23.700 --> 02:20:27.540]  going to be in it? I don't know. I haven't read it. I don't care. It's being directed
[02:20:27.540 --> 02:20:31.380]  and written by a genius named David Ward, who, oh, I don't know, won the academy award
[02:20:31.380 --> 02:20:37.300]  at 23 for writing the sting. Um, and it was his pen that, that, that, and his vision that
[02:20:37.300 --> 02:20:41.540]  created the classic that, that we know today as major league. In fact, a lot of people
[02:20:41.540 --> 02:20:47.140]  think the movie's called wild thing as they should. Um, but whatever. I, um, I agreed
[02:20:47.140 --> 02:20:51.380]  to do it. There's just one, there's one deal point that, uh, that Jim Robinson, a wonderful
[02:20:51.380 --> 02:20:55.460]  man and Morgan Creek, a great company, uh, needs to work out. Um, if they want me in
[02:20:55.460 --> 02:20:58.900]  it, it's a smash. If they don't, it's a turd that opens on a tugboat.
[02:21:01.380 --> 02:21:05.300]  Oh boy, I tell you, because the word in the news is, I mean, all over the LA times,
[02:21:05.300 --> 02:21:07.780]  New York times is that it's a done deal. You're in it and it's coming.
[02:21:08.420 --> 02:21:12.660]  Wow. Well, they didn't, they didn't, uh, I didn't get that text yet. You know,
[02:21:13.380 --> 02:21:17.620]  well, as we know, the mainstream media gets a lot of things wrong. Charlie, uh, side
[02:21:17.620 --> 02:21:24.900]  issue. No way. No way. Those guys. Damn. Why did you decide to, uh, you know, basically
[02:21:24.900 --> 02:21:31.380]  unleash yourself here on this broadcast? Because I'm just, um, I don't know why, why give an
[02:21:31.380 --> 02:21:36.180]  interview when you can leave a warning, you know, that it's just not, um, I'm just not a,
[02:21:36.180 --> 02:21:40.900]  I'm not fair game. I'm not a, I'm not a soft target. It's over. There's a new, uh, there's
[02:21:40.900 --> 02:21:46.180]  a new sheriff in town and he has an army of assassins. Oh, we must speak of the Vatican
[02:21:46.180 --> 02:21:52.180]  assassins. Yes. I, I, I, I don't read anything after it comes out because I will not, I will
[02:21:52.180 --> 02:21:58.820]  not waste my precious time on, on, on, on such ridiculous nonsense. But I understand according
[02:21:58.820 --> 02:22:03.700]  to you that there was a lot of curiosity about the Vatican assassin. Um, and I'm like, guys,
[02:22:03.700 --> 02:22:08.580]  it's right there in the thing. Uh, we work for the Pope. We murder people. We're Vatican assassins.
[02:22:08.580 --> 02:22:14.500]  How complicated can it be? Oh my gosh. What they're not ready for is guys like you and I
[02:22:14.500 --> 02:22:20.740]  and nails and all the other gnarly, gnarling tins in my life. Um, that we are high priests,
[02:22:21.620 --> 02:22:29.620]  uh, Vatican assassin warlocks. Press that people where that goes. Oh man, I tell you, Charlie,
[02:22:29.620 --> 02:22:34.500]  you, uh, and of course we, we tell the, the, the, the inside baseball, it's kind of a sick
[02:22:34.500 --> 02:22:39.540]  joke for me. One of my sickest forms of entertainment is people that make stuff up about me. Just
[02:22:39.540 --> 02:22:43.940]  a pure baloney. And one time I was at your house and I was showing him stuff where they're claiming
[02:22:43.940 --> 02:22:47.860]  that we work for the Pope and stuff. And me and Charlie are Vatican assassins. So that's kind of
[02:22:47.860 --> 02:22:53.620]  the roots of that for the media. And a Charlie, uh, called, uh, the great, uh, San Francisco
[02:22:53.620 --> 02:22:58.420]  Giants closer when he was visiting his house, somebody who Wilson, Brian Wilson, Brian Wilson.
[02:22:58.420 --> 02:23:03.300]  Uh, hey, what was the full quote you called him? You know, just awesome Vatican assassin.
[02:23:03.860 --> 02:23:09.540]  Yeah, I did. Yeah. Because he's nothing shy of that. And, um, and it is his job to go out there
[02:23:09.540 --> 02:23:14.100]  and embarrass people, embarrass them, not just beat them, but embarrass them in the process. And
[02:23:14.820 --> 02:23:22.180]  he's, uh, he's, he's, he's as radical as you, as you think he might be. Now, if, if, if he chooses
[02:23:22.180 --> 02:23:28.420]  to do so, he will stop your heart and he will, he will behead you. And all in service to the Pope.
[02:23:28.980 --> 02:23:34.500]  Absolutely. That's what we do. That's what we do. All right. Uh, uh, getting into apocalypse now,
[02:23:34.500 --> 02:23:38.980]  that's one of the, uh, things it's probably my favorite movie. I know it's yours. Of course,
[02:23:38.980 --> 02:23:43.220]  your dad stars in it. You were there for months during the production of it, put a big, uh, mark
[02:23:43.220 --> 02:23:51.300]  on your, uh, soul, uh, apocalypse now, my friend. I mean, there's not much you can say other than
[02:23:51.300 --> 02:23:58.580]  genius, uh, represents life. Apocalypse will teach you how to, how to live inside of a moment
[02:23:58.580 --> 02:24:03.860]  between a moment. And that's where life is because, you know, I'm not just, I'm not just,
[02:24:03.860 --> 02:24:07.780]  you know, Captain Willard and much as my dad and I'm, you know, heading up the river to kill
[02:24:07.780 --> 02:24:11.540]  another part of me, which is Kurtz. Uh, I am every character in between,
[02:24:11.540 --> 02:24:14.900]  safe and a little weirdo with his guts strapped in begging for water. That's not me.
[02:24:15.940 --> 02:24:20.740]  But, you know, there are parts of me that are Dennis Hopper because my, my, my, my motto now is
[02:24:20.740 --> 02:24:26.500]  you either love or you hate and you must do so violently. And the reason you must hate violently
[02:24:26.500 --> 02:24:30.260]  is because, and you have to hate everybody that's not in your family because they're there to
[02:24:30.260 --> 02:24:35.300]  destroy your family and they will, and it will come at you in all forms and shapes. And therefore,
[02:24:35.300 --> 02:24:39.780]  there's nothing in the middle. I don't live in the middle anymore. That's where you get slaughtered.
[02:24:39.780 --> 02:24:44.500]  That's where you get embarrassed in front of the prom queen. And I just, it's just not,
[02:24:44.500 --> 02:24:49.860]  it's just not an option. So, you know, within that is, is, is tremendous focus and tremendous
[02:24:49.860 --> 02:24:55.940]  clarity and tremendous peace because you have absolute and total resolve about your decisions.
[02:24:55.940 --> 02:25:00.500]  If you love with violence and you hate with violence, there's nothing that can be questioned.
[02:25:00.500 --> 02:25:04.900]  And people say, oh, you know, you've got to work through your resentments. Yeah. No, I'm going to
[02:25:04.900 --> 02:25:08.980]  hang on to them and they're going to fuel my attack and they're going to fuel the battle for
[02:25:08.980 --> 02:25:14.580]  I have my deadly and dangerous secret and silent soldiers because they're all around you. Anyway,
[02:25:14.580 --> 02:25:17.300]  I thought you were just messing with one dude. Sorry. Winning.
[02:25:18.820 --> 02:25:24.500]  Well, Charlie, I mean, I tell you, it is amazing. And I just appreciate you coming on today. So
[02:25:24.500 --> 02:25:30.500]  folks can really hear the, the energized, unleashed Charlie Sheen. You wanted to talk about AA
[02:25:30.500 --> 02:25:34.740]  because, you know, when I was at your house, I said, man, great job being completely sober and,
[02:25:34.740 --> 02:25:39.620]  you know, how important was it? But, but I can't use the word sober because that's a term from
[02:25:39.620 --> 02:25:45.860]  those people. And I'm just, I've, I have cleansed myself. I close my eyes and and then it's a
[02:25:45.860 --> 02:25:51.380]  nanosecond. I cured myself from this ridiculous model of disease and addiction and obsession.
[02:25:51.380 --> 02:25:58.020]  It's just, it's just the work of sissies. The only thing I'm addicted to right now is winning,
[02:25:58.020 --> 02:26:06.660]  you know, this, this, this bootleg cult, you know, arrogantly referred to as alcohol exonomists is
[02:26:06.660 --> 02:26:12.980]  Alex supports a 5% success rate. My success rate is 100%. Do the math. Take for instance,
[02:26:12.980 --> 02:26:17.780]  it's founder of death written, I don't know, broken down plagiarist state high on acid until
[02:26:17.780 --> 02:26:22.820]  the day he died. I can't seem to find that chapter in his silly book of lies. And then now I try to
[02:26:22.820 --> 02:26:29.220]  get your mind around this as a as a fellow warrior deep in the trenches. Their entire manifesto is
[02:26:29.220 --> 02:26:35.060]  built upon a complete and total surrender or the concept of complete and total surrender. They urge
[02:26:35.060 --> 02:26:40.420]  you to put down your sword and come join the winners. In 22 years, the only winners I could
[02:26:40.420 --> 02:26:45.620]  locate in their toothless warren were either driving a convertible van or living like trolls
[02:26:45.620 --> 02:26:51.300]  under some abandoned bridge. Another one of the stupid monos, Alex is, uh, don't be special,
[02:26:51.300 --> 02:26:57.620]  be one of us. Newsflash, I am special and I will never be one of you. There it is.
[02:26:57.620 --> 02:27:04.100]  You sound like Thomas Jefferson. Well, I'm not Thomas Jefferson. He was a pussy. Um,
[02:27:04.900 --> 02:27:10.020]  no, but I, but I, but I dare anyone to debate me on things, debate me on AA right now.
[02:27:10.020 --> 02:27:15.860]  I have a disease bullshit. I cured it with my brain, with my mind. I'm cured. I'm done. Well,
[02:27:15.860 --> 02:27:20.100]  we all have to sit in here and touch ourselves and frown. Well, you know, you don't look like
[02:27:20.100 --> 02:27:25.060]  you're having a lot of fun. I'm going to hang out with these two smoke and hotties and fly privately
[02:27:25.060 --> 02:27:30.180]  around the world. You know, it might be lonely up here, but I sure like the view, Alex. Well,
[02:27:30.180 --> 02:27:35.220]  it happens when you become the top of your game. Um, you know, it's a double meaning. It is lonely
[02:27:35.220 --> 02:27:39.940]  at the top. And then a lot of people do hate you, come after you, attack you. And I know for years,
[02:27:39.940 --> 02:27:45.780]  you've just put up with it, but it sounds like you're done. I'm done. I'm done. It's on. Bring it,
[02:27:45.780 --> 02:27:51.460]  as I say. I ain't hiding. You know, and if you're a part of my family, I will love you violently.
[02:27:52.740 --> 02:27:56.500]  If you infiltrate and try to hurt my family, I will murder you violently
[02:27:58.020 --> 02:28:04.740]  in the info war, in the info war. Absolutely. Yes. We want to, the media would certainly try
[02:28:04.740 --> 02:28:09.940]  to spin that. You mean? Of course. Wow. We're going to come back, Charlie. We only got two
[02:28:09.940 --> 02:28:14.180]  more points to get to. And then we're going to bring up a mutual friend and another awesome,
[02:28:14.180 --> 02:28:20.340]  awesome, Vatican assassin. This guy's got more notches on his belt and I don't know who black
[02:28:20.340 --> 02:28:25.620]  Bart, you know, so, so we're going to break here in a moment and let you take a break,
[02:28:25.620 --> 02:28:28.100]  but come right back to you, Charlie, for a few minutes. Then we're going to introduce him with
[02:28:28.100 --> 02:28:35.700]  you at the same time that we'll go on with him alone, but there are a few other points here. Jaws.
[02:28:35.700 --> 02:28:40.580]  Let's start talking about Jaws, how great that was. You thought to a few days ago, go out on the
[02:28:40.580 --> 02:28:45.620]  Pacific Ocean in a big yacht while watching Jaws and you said the horizon matched the
[02:28:45.620 --> 02:28:50.900]  television perfectly. It was incredible. If you haven't done this, I urge you to make plans and
[02:28:50.900 --> 02:28:55.460]  do this tonight. What I wanted to do is I wanted to watch Jaws on the ocean in the dark and be
[02:28:55.460 --> 02:29:00.980]  afraid. I wanted to embrace the fear and relive the movie. What I didn't count on was it basically
[02:29:00.980 --> 02:29:06.580]  turned into Star Tours. It turned into 4D because there were moments during the Indianapolis speech
[02:29:07.860 --> 02:29:13.300]  which is about looking fear right down the barrel, which nobody understands anymore,
[02:29:13.300 --> 02:29:19.540]  where their horizon matched ours. We were basically in the orca listening to the speech.
[02:29:19.540 --> 02:29:23.780]  This is me not on drugs, bro. As I said, the first one's free, the next one goes in your mouth.
[02:29:23.780 --> 02:29:29.780]  So, it was an incredible experience and I felt, you know, I of course took full credit but I had no
[02:29:29.780 --> 02:29:36.180]  idea that the 4th dimensional aspect of it would occur and it occurred in such a magical sense
[02:29:36.180 --> 02:29:43.060]  that we all just sat there in awe and with our Jaws open. Incredible Charlie, stay there,
[02:29:43.060 --> 02:29:46.580]  take a break. We'll be right back with you and Nail. Stay with us.
[02:29:46.580 --> 02:29:58.020]  We're on the march. The empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:00.820 --> 02:30:05.380]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:30:05.380 --> 02:30:09.700]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:30:09.700 --> 02:30:14.340]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[02:30:14.340 --> 02:30:19.620]  allows you to have. It's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[02:30:19.620 --> 02:30:24.740]  technology is coming. Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously
[02:30:24.740 --> 02:30:30.180]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem. Number four,
[02:30:30.180 --> 02:30:34.900]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families lose their
[02:30:34.900 --> 02:30:40.020]  power from weather related onages. Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[02:30:40.020 --> 02:30:44.020]  insurance and peace of mind. Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by
[02:30:44.020 --> 02:30:50.740]  Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.

[02:32:05.620 --> 02:32:10.340]  This is our last chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda,
[02:32:11.140 --> 02:32:16.020]  they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I've terminated influence
[02:32:16.020 --> 02:32:22.020]  on our president in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all
[02:32:22.020 --> 02:32:28.020]  of us as American citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[02:32:28.020 --> 02:32:34.500]  nation. The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[02:32:34.500 --> 02:32:39.220]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists. They're asking for more matches.
[02:32:39.220 --> 02:32:43.780]  And the Congress is saying, who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care.
[02:32:43.780 --> 02:32:50.420]  And right now in Washington DC, we have seen a fall of the Republic. Yet your copy of Fall of
[02:32:50.420 --> 02:32:57.380]  the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're watching online right now in super high quality at
[02:32:57.380 --> 02:33:23.380]  prismplanet.tv.
[02:33:28.100 --> 02:33:34.900]  Wild thing, I think I love you. But I want to know for sure.
[02:33:35.700 --> 02:33:40.820]  All right, Charlie Sheen is our guest in a few minutes. We're going to bring in Nails here,
[02:33:40.820 --> 02:33:44.580]  Lenny Dykstra Center, Felder for the New York Mets and the Philadelphia Phillies,
[02:33:44.580 --> 02:33:51.860]  three-time MLB All-Star 1994-95 World Series champion 1986 with the Mets. And by the way,
[02:33:51.860 --> 02:33:56.580]  you haven't heard the media since he beat JP Morgan in court and beat over 200 SEC probes.
[02:33:56.580 --> 02:34:00.580]  That's right, ladies and gentlemen. They basically set him up and I've done the research.
[02:34:01.140 --> 02:34:05.140]  He's one of the guys that's been beating the banks with the big mortgage gate situation.
[02:34:05.140 --> 02:34:08.340]  They set him up. He'll be joining us coming up. Let's talk about baseball.
[02:34:08.340 --> 02:34:12.260]  Then after Charlie leaves, we'll get into his story in the next week, a full hour with him.
[02:34:12.260 --> 02:34:15.140]  But Charlie, you've got a note that you wanted to read here on air.
[02:34:16.260 --> 02:34:21.620]  Yeah, yes, I do. And it's from one of my goddesses. It's from the Natty.
[02:34:21.620 --> 02:34:28.660]  And it just says, this is how blessed and perfect my insane life is. My monkey man,
[02:34:28.660 --> 02:34:34.500]  my king, my high priest, Ninja Warlock. I love you violently with the fire of 1,000 suns.
[02:34:34.500 --> 02:34:39.300]  Thank you for sharing your wisdom, experience, Jedi mind powers, amazing humor and unconditional love.
[02:34:39.860 --> 02:34:46.740]  I am truly honored to not walk behind nor in front of you, but by your side and with a capital C.
[02:34:46.740 --> 02:34:52.340]  Now, Charlie, I know that I made the joke that time about the Vatican assassins with you and you
[02:34:52.340 --> 02:34:57.460]  don't care if people run with it and them saying we're warlocks. I understand that's a funny joke
[02:34:57.460 --> 02:35:00.740]  to you, but they'll take it serious. Actually, one time I was at your house, you were reading
[02:35:00.740 --> 02:35:06.420]  the Citizen Rulebook and talking about our God-given rights. What is your view about heaven and hell
[02:35:06.420 --> 02:35:13.140]  in life? Because in person, you're a very loving, good person. Yeah, I mean, I find heaven in the
[02:35:13.140 --> 02:35:19.220]  eyes of my family. That includes all of them. And I find hell in the eyes of everyone who tries to
[02:35:20.020 --> 02:35:25.140]  disrupt that love. Period. I can't find that in the Bible, but whatever, it's really kind of
[02:35:26.020 --> 02:35:30.900]  boring and long and talking snakes and wow, wow, we give up all Sunday for that garbage.
[02:35:32.260 --> 02:35:35.860]  Well, we're missing a lot of good supports, people. Lots of good supports.
[02:35:35.860 --> 02:35:41.860]  Well, Charlie, I'm just glad that you are clean. And as you're saying, never again,
[02:35:41.860 --> 02:35:47.780]  totally committed. This is it. Right now it is. I don't know, man, I'm just saying,
[02:35:47.780 --> 02:35:52.980]  you know, I just don't subscribe to any part of the model. So I am my own man. I make a decision
[02:35:52.980 --> 02:35:58.500]  that day and then, you know, within inside the moments and I live with them good or bad. They're
[02:35:58.500 --> 02:36:05.860]  mostly good though. Well, Charlie, before we bring nails up here and talk about, you know,
[02:36:05.860 --> 02:36:09.380]  the baseball stuff you guys are doing and working with kids in the community like you did a few
[02:36:09.380 --> 02:36:17.220]  weeks ago and, you know, telling kids not to use drugs. What's your bottom line on any other
[02:36:17.220 --> 02:36:20.580]  points? Because I know you've told me you're not going to be doing a lot of interviews
[02:36:21.620 --> 02:36:26.100]  for anything else you want to impart to folks out there. I want to see if I want to see if
[02:36:26.100 --> 02:36:29.300]  nails can get his mind, his beautiful mind around this one because, you know,
[02:36:31.540 --> 02:36:37.780]  I look at the game of baseball and I'm reminded of a quote that I wrote. It is a perfect game
[02:36:37.780 --> 02:36:42.500]  where it's a poetic ebb and flow can silence the loudest crying infant in the universe into a
[02:36:42.500 --> 02:36:51.060]  smile draped nap. That's pretty heavy. Not bad. It goes on and on. But, you know, people will just
[02:36:51.060 --> 02:36:54.900]  tune out at some point because they're stupid. Well, let me tell you the voice messages you've
[02:36:54.900 --> 02:36:59.300]  left me that are private. That's some pretty powerful poetry. I mean, you're on fire. I mean,
[02:36:59.300 --> 02:37:05.300]  you're you're not reading poetry aloud in a voice. You are literally spewing pretty powerful
[02:37:05.300 --> 02:37:09.140]  poetry, even more powerful than what I've heard here today about Jaws. And that was
[02:37:09.140 --> 02:37:15.540]  pretty epic. I mean, Charlie, you're on fire. Well, I've been, you know, I was my passion was
[02:37:15.540 --> 02:37:19.620]  asleep for a long time. But like I told Dan Patrick, one of my favorite people alive,
[02:37:19.620 --> 02:37:26.820]  he's an absolute ninja warrior, Vatican assassin, borderline borderline warlock. You know, it's
[02:37:27.700 --> 02:37:32.420]  they couldn't they couldn't extinguish my pilot light. And that was a mistake.
[02:37:32.420 --> 02:37:39.140]  That was their mistake. So just dumped some rocket fuel on it and woke up my brain and said,
[02:37:39.140 --> 02:37:42.820]  All right, I woke up on 45, I got five kids and I've been pushing, you know, I've been
[02:37:42.820 --> 02:37:49.940]  dumped on for too long. And, you know, one of my favorite poets is Eminem on the smartest cats
[02:37:49.940 --> 02:37:56.180]  alive. He actually fire me, you know, he actually made me to stay violent. He actually put out a
[02:37:56.180 --> 02:38:01.460]  9 11 truth video. I'm sure you're aware of that. Now it's five years ago. I mean, he certainly
[02:38:01.460 --> 02:38:04.340]  tuned into reality. You want to reach out to him, Charlie? You could probably, you know,
[02:38:04.340 --> 02:38:08.820]  actually get a hold of him. I'll reach out to him right now. Let's, let's, let's, let's hook up and
[02:38:08.820 --> 02:38:16.340]  just, just bring fiery death. And you mean fiery death to lies and propaganda and hypocrisy.
[02:38:16.340 --> 02:38:19.620]  Yeah, but see, look at how they've gotten into your brain, dude. That's like, now we have to
[02:38:19.620 --> 02:38:23.700]  like qualify everything. I don't know. Fiery death, man. You don't let them figure it out.
[02:38:23.700 --> 02:38:28.180]  No, I totally. If it comes from the sky or from my heart, then it's going to have the same level
[02:38:28.180 --> 02:38:36.260]  of destruction. Charlie Sheen on fire. Charlie Sheen, unloosed. You're hearing the, the, the
[02:38:36.260 --> 02:38:42.660]  real Charlie Sheen here on air right now. And my phone. Let me ask you this. Who, who, who,
[02:38:42.660 --> 02:38:49.700]  who have you ever referred to in the past as a tarot card? You. Thank you. I'll take it. I'm worth it.
[02:38:51.060 --> 02:38:57.860]  Well, what I meant by that is you have always been a giant, you know, top of the cream Hollywood
[02:38:57.860 --> 02:39:05.540]  star for many years now, the number one TV show, most rated, most money. But, but now, because
[02:39:05.540 --> 02:39:10.980]  the media has continued to, to, to try to say you're going to be destroyed. Now there's this
[02:39:10.980 --> 02:39:15.780]  image that you're bulletproof and invincible. And, you know, I'd say don't, you know, tempt the fates
[02:39:15.780 --> 02:39:19.460]  and, and, and, you know, I pray for you and I love you and I care about you because I know
[02:39:19.460 --> 02:39:25.940]  you're real and you're a loving person. But I mean, you are, you have become an art type of almost
[02:39:25.940 --> 02:39:32.340]  like a Bacchus or something. You know, that's the Roman wine God. But I'm terribly flattered. Keep
[02:39:32.340 --> 02:39:36.020]  going. Keep going. Keep talking about me like this. People need to hear this, man.
[02:39:36.980 --> 02:39:43.140]  Man, I tell you, Charlie, you, you're, I was always amazed by your, your knowledge of history and
[02:39:43.140 --> 02:39:48.020]  interesting things and, and, and, but, but, but, but you were so tightly wound and focused and,
[02:39:48.020 --> 02:39:52.740]  and, and quiet all the times I hung out with you. And then you kind of went into this wild
[02:39:52.740 --> 02:40:00.420]  period and you've just come out of it. Just, just, I was, I was shackled and oppressed by the, by the,
[02:40:00.420 --> 02:40:10.900]  by the, by the, by the deplorable, as I said, cult of AA for 22 years. So, you know, kind of feeling
[02:40:10.900 --> 02:40:15.700]  like it's time to stretch away from all those clowns. Let me bring up one more point on that
[02:40:15.700 --> 02:40:20.100]  subject. You talk about it being a cult. I'm not, I don't know enough about AA, never been to a
[02:40:20.100 --> 02:40:24.740]  meeting, but I have read their book and I've talked, and I've talked to losers and I've talked to a
[02:40:24.740 --> 02:40:28.580]  lot of people that have been involved and they do describe it as a cult saying, be part of the
[02:40:28.580 --> 02:40:32.100]  group. Don't be an individual. And that's why I mentioned Thomas Jefferson. He was the opposite
[02:40:32.100 --> 02:40:36.980]  of that. And so it does have some of those, uh, hallmarks, but, you know, also you've, uh, you
[02:40:36.980 --> 02:40:40.660]  know, I mean, are, are you saying basically it's something kind of like Scientology, but different?
[02:40:41.460 --> 02:40:44.980]  I don't, I don't know enough, enough about what I call the church of the Martian idiot,
[02:40:44.980 --> 02:40:49.940]  uh, to really, to, to, to comment on it. I mean, what they, what they profess to believe in is,
[02:40:49.940 --> 02:40:54.740]  I don't know, I always thought of us like a really complicated, long joke with no good punchline.
[02:40:56.500 --> 02:41:02.500]  But yeah, no, I, I, I just 22 years around those, those oppressive clowns and losers I did,
[02:41:02.500 --> 02:41:08.660]  just, you know, finally extracted myself from their, from their troll hole and started living
[02:41:08.660 --> 02:41:13.060]  my life the way I want to live it, because they, it's not teach you how to live your life the way
[02:41:13.060 --> 02:41:18.580]  you want to live it. It's vintage. It's outdated. It's stupid. And it's, and it's, and it's worshiped
[02:41:18.580 --> 02:41:24.180]  by stupid people. And it is their fault. God damn it. It's like, Oh, you can't blame people for,
[02:41:24.180 --> 02:41:28.660]  you know, being dumb. It's like they're, they're dumb as what they've been taught. No, bullshit.
[02:41:29.220 --> 02:41:33.940]  Sorry. Step up, step up and change it. Change it right now. Look your father in the eye and say,
[02:41:33.940 --> 02:41:37.860]  you're wrong. I'm different. I'm better. Watch me. Watch me bury you.
[02:41:37.860 --> 02:41:46.260]  And Charlie, you will be back at work Tuesday. I'll be early. I don't sleep. I wait.
[02:41:48.100 --> 02:41:53.860]  I know you don't sleep. Sometimes I get texts from you at 3am your time. You are,
[02:41:53.860 --> 02:41:58.340]  you are certainly on fire, my friend. Well, I think you have basically taken over the news
[02:41:58.340 --> 02:42:03.700]  cycle for the next week here on this broadcast. Great, great. You know, let's talk about something
[02:42:03.700 --> 02:42:10.340]  exciting. Me, all this other boring garbage crap, you know, man, Charlie, but I mean,
[02:42:10.340 --> 02:42:14.820]  you're describing this, you're saying you've come out of a cult for 20 years and that's why
[02:42:14.820 --> 02:42:20.500]  you're on fire. It suffocated my soul. They hijacked my brain. They brainwashed my friends and my
[02:42:20.500 --> 02:42:26.500]  family. Now I hate them violently. And I will use every soldier in my army to defend myself
[02:42:26.500 --> 02:42:29.940]  against them because they will come at me. They will come at me with all of their doctors and
[02:42:29.940 --> 02:42:35.540]  their fucking heads and all their other freaking loser clowns. And shame on these, these outlets
[02:42:35.540 --> 02:42:40.420]  that give these people the time to speak about me. How dare they speak of me? We've never met.
[02:42:40.420 --> 02:42:45.060]  How dare they? That's another thing. Another one, you know, one of my other credos. I don't,
[02:42:45.060 --> 02:42:48.420]  everybody has a black belt and carries a gun. I don't mess with people. I don't get up in people's
[02:42:48.420 --> 02:42:53.860]  girls and tell them, you know, I must now impose my silly will on you. But dude, we just met and
[02:42:53.860 --> 02:42:57.940]  I just, all I did was ask you for a cigarette. I'm like, yes, but, but, you know, dude,
[02:42:57.940 --> 02:43:03.380]  everything after Bud is just dial tone. You know what I'm saying? Oh, but believe me, Charlie,
[02:43:03.380 --> 02:43:07.700]  I am, I am really hearing you today. Basically, you're, you're telling the world I'm an
[02:43:07.700 --> 02:43:12.500]  individual. I control my own destiny. Stop speaking for me. I mean, look, I get calls
[02:43:12.500 --> 02:43:19.780]  probably every week for six years from the Hollywood reporter, ABC news. I mean, my phone's
[02:43:19.780 --> 02:43:24.340]  over here ringing off the hook with national media and I called you this morning and said,
[02:43:24.340 --> 02:43:27.780]  I'm getting TMZ and other people calling me. I said, I don't want to comment. I just want to
[02:43:27.780 --> 02:43:33.780]  let you speak for yourself. You said, absolutely, absolutely. See, I mean, I don't run around. The
[02:43:33.780 --> 02:43:38.180]  one time I went on TV to talk about when you first went public for 911 truth, I called you and said,
[02:43:38.180 --> 02:43:42.100]  do you even want me to do this? I don't want to speak for you. Why don't you go on? You said,
[02:43:42.100 --> 02:43:46.580]  no, do it. But then all these other people you led into your life and they just give out all your
[02:43:46.580 --> 02:43:51.700]  personal information on and on and on and it's wrong. Yeah, but they think it's personal. They
[02:43:51.700 --> 02:43:55.460]  think it's information. It's nothing. It's a smokescreen, dude. It's come on. They don't
[02:43:55.460 --> 02:44:01.060]  know me. They never will. They don't deserve to. You know, I'm rolling out magic, bro, and I must
[02:44:01.060 --> 02:44:09.940]  save it for my family. Well, Charlie Sheen indomitable. Just off the charts interview here.
[02:44:09.940 --> 02:44:17.780]  Let's, uh, let's bring up your friend, somebody who is defeated JP Morgan. Of course, everybody
[02:44:17.780 --> 02:44:22.980]  knows Lenny Dykstrom. And of course, he won the World Series championship in 86 with the Mets.
[02:44:22.980 --> 02:44:26.500]  I'm not going to go over his whole record, but he's one of the greats that, you know, hit 400
[02:44:27.460 --> 02:44:32.900]  in August. I mean, Charlie, you introduce him. Nails is here. Tell us about nails.
[02:44:33.780 --> 02:44:39.700]  He's just, he's, he's, he's hardcore and it's with a capital C. There's a movie called Hardcore
[02:44:39.700 --> 02:44:44.420]  with George C Scott. So you can be hardcore and just be George Scott. You can be hardcore and
[02:44:44.420 --> 02:44:50.980]  then, you know, you get a lowercase C. My man is an uppercase George C Scott hardcore.
[02:44:52.660 --> 02:44:58.020]  Um, here he is. Nails, you've been sitting here for 20 minutes on hold. What do you think of
[02:44:58.020 --> 02:45:07.060]  what Charlie is saying? Actually, I don't want him to stop. I mean, and Charlie knows me. I don't
[02:45:07.060 --> 02:45:11.300]  really tell him what he wants to hear. I just tell him the truth, which is why we love each other
[02:45:11.300 --> 02:45:14.580]  unconditionally and with violence. And you're, and you're one of the best dudes alive, bro.
[02:45:14.580 --> 02:45:21.700]  No, no, you are. I mean, look, the thing about me is a lot of people don't like me because I
[02:45:21.700 --> 02:45:28.020]  tell the truth. And, um, and right now, Charlie is, when I stay in play with the guys on point,
[02:45:28.020 --> 02:45:33.380]  I mean, and when I say on point, I mean, it's almost like he's on a mission. Anybody in its
[02:45:33.380 --> 02:45:38.180]  way, they're going to get mowed down and, and if they don't like it, that's the way it is.
[02:45:38.180 --> 02:45:42.500]  And remember that, that, that, that bald fool that came in with his therapy and his voodoo and he
[02:45:42.500 --> 02:45:47.300]  tried to judge me. He said I was too excited. Um, the only thing I got excited about was catching
[02:45:47.300 --> 02:45:53.780]  the last drop of blood just before his beheaded silly dome made, made contact with my beautiful
[02:45:53.780 --> 02:46:00.420]  wooden floor in my home in front of my children. I'll tell you, plus the way the man uses the
[02:46:00.420 --> 02:46:08.340]  English language is, uh, the thing about you, Charlie is, is not realized how brilliant you are.
[02:46:08.340 --> 02:46:12.820]  And by the way, oh, you're, you're too kind, but you speak the truth. I'm not, I'm not a guy
[02:46:12.820 --> 02:46:16.580]  to get out of need. If you know what I mean, if you know what I mean, I got your bone, neither
[02:46:16.580 --> 02:46:20.580]  mind. I think you know what I mean. But what I'm saying is I like to be around people I can learn
[02:46:20.580 --> 02:46:25.780]  stuff from. Okay. And if I can't learn something every day, then it's kind of a lost day.
[02:46:25.780 --> 02:46:31.540]  Um, with very well said, my man, very well said, Len. Very well said. But I'll tell you what's
[02:46:31.540 --> 02:46:38.900]  better said, every day I'm with Charlie, I, he continues to set new marks, meaning I keep saying
[02:46:38.900 --> 02:46:44.660]  there's got to be three of you. Uh, there has to be, but, but there's not, there's one of them.
[02:46:44.660 --> 02:46:51.540]  And, and, and right now, um, again, I appreciate the, um, the kind words and, and the one thing
[02:46:51.540 --> 02:46:57.620]  about me, I can, I can tell you, you got me on your team and then, then you got, you got to take
[02:46:57.620 --> 02:47:03.780]  a bullet for you. And, and I will, and I will, I will watch it bounce off as I finish my ham sandwich.
[02:47:04.500 --> 02:47:07.940]  Charlie, something we've talked about privately, uh, changed the subject for a moment. I want to
[02:47:07.940 --> 02:47:12.580]  get nails take on this. The TSA isn't just in the airports now. You got to fly into private judges
[02:47:12.580 --> 02:47:17.140]  to get away from them, sticking their hands down people's pants. Drugs report has the headline
[02:47:17.140 --> 02:47:23.300]  from Gizmodo, TSA agents pat down nine-year-old boy after train trip. They're, they've got
[02:47:23.300 --> 02:47:28.980]  telescreens in Walmart saying, watch your neighbors. I mean, is this not the Gestapo rollout in America?
[02:47:29.620 --> 02:47:35.060]  I mean, uh, kind of right there on the open, anybody that wants to ignore it deserves to
[02:47:35.060 --> 02:47:39.460]  have their privates fondled by some clown who worked at, worked at door at Walmart seven minutes
[02:47:39.460 --> 02:47:44.580]  before that. And then it took them six minutes to get to the airport. Losers and clowns and trolls,
[02:47:44.580 --> 02:47:48.500]  all of them touch my children and I will eat your hands off your fricking arms.
[02:47:49.220 --> 02:47:52.740]  Well, that's actually what Ron Paul said. He said, if America lets this happen
[02:47:52.740 --> 02:47:57.460]  and lets them train us to be slaves, uh, and this is like prisoner induction training,
[02:47:57.460 --> 02:48:00.500]  then we deserve what we get. And Jesse Ventura said that as well.
[02:48:01.940 --> 02:48:05.380]  Kind of true. You know, people say, I can't be blamed for my ignorance. Yeah. Well, who else am
[02:48:05.380 --> 02:48:09.620]  I going to blame? Your stupid wife. Good God. Go away. Go back to the control hall where you
[02:48:09.620 --> 02:48:16.980]  came from fool. Oh man, this is, this is incredible, Charlie. You know, we're doing this interview
[02:48:16.980 --> 02:48:21.780]  here and I just appreciate you doing it here. You're my friend. I care about you and I, and, and,
[02:48:21.780 --> 02:48:26.260]  and obviously, uh, this is going to bring a lot of attention in full wars.com and prison.
[02:48:26.260 --> 02:48:30.260]  By the way, they're going to ignore this. Come on. This is, it'll be as though it never even happened.
[02:48:31.460 --> 02:48:37.940]  Yeah. I'm actually, uh, scanning the news, Charlie, this interview. Are we going viral?
[02:48:37.940 --> 02:48:44.820]  I would call it not supernova, uh, about a trillion times bigger. It says if, uh, uh,
[02:48:44.820 --> 02:48:48.100]  the entire universe of media is exploding right now.
[02:48:48.100 --> 02:48:52.340]  Wow. Well, you know, that's, uh, I'm just giving them what I guess they want. I just don't know
[02:48:52.340 --> 02:48:58.020]  if they can handle it. Pussies. The truth, the truth always works. It doesn't. And the truth
[02:48:58.020 --> 02:49:01.540]  is unchanging, Len. That's why you don't have to remember. You just live inside of it and everybody
[02:49:01.540 --> 02:49:08.820]  just falls down like, like plastic bowling pins. I don't know. Bad analogy, but you don't understand.
[02:49:10.820 --> 02:49:14.580]  Everybody's out there. We're in a cardboard belt, like begging, begging for something and
[02:49:14.580 --> 02:49:20.180]  they get nothing. That's all they deserve, man. Charlie, of the giant, of the giant pantheon
[02:49:20.180 --> 02:49:26.740]  of, uh, Hollywood stars and TV stars, why are you the one that the media obsesses on more than
[02:49:26.740 --> 02:49:32.180]  really anybody I've ever seen? I mean, I mean, it's like, uh, I mean, uh, it's crazy. I mean,
[02:49:32.180 --> 02:49:36.660]  it's just Charlie Sheen, Charlie Sheen, Charlie Sheen, Charlie Sheen. I don't know, man. I'm
[02:49:36.660 --> 02:49:41.780]  just, I guess I'm just that goddamn bitching and, and interesting. They want what he has, man.
[02:49:41.780 --> 02:49:46.420]  Yeah, there you go. And they can't, and they can't process it, Len. They can't, they can't process
[02:49:46.420 --> 02:49:51.540]  it. So they're baffled and they must write their silly words and command me from a place of opinion
[02:49:51.540 --> 02:49:56.980]  and judgment. That's why Brando says it willard. Have you ever considered, you know, being free
[02:49:56.980 --> 02:50:02.580]  from, from the opinions of others, from the opinions of yourself? I think today is a perfect
[02:50:02.580 --> 02:50:08.820]  example of just that. Wow. I don't know. When I do this, one out of one. I broke it down
[02:50:08.820 --> 02:50:13.860]  baseball player, man. That's deep. Thanks, bro. I mean, do you, do you, what's that expression?
[02:50:13.860 --> 02:50:16.660]  You got, you know, I, you did take a few in the head, but you're still pretty sure. I got a lot
[02:50:16.660 --> 02:50:23.860]  of pitches, but, but not that many. I love that, man. I love that. In fact, you guys talk,
[02:50:23.860 --> 02:50:28.100]  some long talks, bro, to get ready for major league dreams. Started, started with Todd Zeal
[02:50:28.100 --> 02:50:31.860]  the other day and he was actually pretty impressed. And then one of the goddesses came out and the
[02:50:31.860 --> 02:50:36.180]  reason my arm is sore today is because I hopped it up like two weeks sooner than I could. I told
[02:50:36.180 --> 02:50:40.580]  you that, dude. I know, I know, but, but, but do not put one of them in front of me with a baseball
[02:50:40.580 --> 02:50:44.340]  in my hand because violent things will happen, you know? Yeah, we're going to go to Charlie.

[02:50:53.540 --> 02:51:01.060]  obviously as, as you can see, but you know, the government kills a million Iraqis. They're the
[02:51:01.060 --> 02:51:05.060]  good guys. Is it really possible to get out of debt without payment plans or attorneys?

[02:54:19.780 --> 02:54:30.820]  Well, Charlie, I am just really glad that you are 100% clean. You're on fire, and again,
[02:54:30.820 --> 02:54:34.660]  people don't judge Rush Limbaugh for what he's done, and you're a lot better man than he on
[02:54:35.300 --> 02:54:41.220]  many fronts. But can I just say this, Alex? I've never met the man. Therefore, I have no personal
[02:54:41.220 --> 02:54:46.820]  experience of him, so I cannot speak of him. Absolutely, but the thing I was going to get to,
[02:54:46.820 --> 02:54:51.700]  during the break, we were talking about two and a half men and what you've been told behind the scenes,
[02:54:51.700 --> 02:54:56.100]  and I do see some news reports, the rumors going on. You want to speak to that?
[02:54:56.980 --> 02:55:00.900]  Yeah, I was told if I, you know, if I, if I went on the attack, they would cancel the show and
[02:55:01.540 --> 02:55:05.060]  all that, and so I'm just sort of seeing if they're telling the truth or not. I,
[02:55:05.060 --> 02:55:09.540]  as, what was the thing you just said, Nails? I mean, yeah, yeah, they don't like money no
[02:55:09.540 --> 02:55:13.780]  more. They, they, they, they all of a sudden stop liking money. Come on, cancel the show. They're
[02:55:13.780 --> 02:55:17.780]  going to cancel the show and not be a ballerina dancer, man. No, no, no. Are they happy, are
[02:55:17.780 --> 02:55:20.980]  they happy with the five billion they've already made off me, or do they think they can turn that
[02:55:20.980 --> 02:55:24.900]  into ten in a couple more seasons? I don't know, I'm just saying, you know, it's a runaway freaking
[02:55:24.900 --> 02:55:28.820]  juggernaut. Well, let me tell you what they're saying, Charlie, and again, these are tabloid
[02:55:28.820 --> 02:55:32.740]  sites, which is probably not true. They're saying they're going to have the show without you. That's,
[02:55:32.740 --> 02:55:38.100]  that's, that's like having, having the sunrise without the sun. See, I want your ratings, dudes,
[02:55:38.100 --> 02:55:43.060]  watch your stupid ratings, whatever, whatever you do what you gotta do, man. I'll go, I'll go make
[02:55:43.060 --> 02:55:47.620]  movies with superstars and I'll work with idiots, you know? Who's giving that info? I guarantee
[02:55:47.620 --> 02:55:52.660]  someone from that, I knew the show, it's a bunch of bozos. No, it is, it's super bozo sites saying it.
[02:55:53.700 --> 02:56:00.580]  Speaking of, speaking of not a bozo, but a, but a real stud was, was Brian Wilson when he came
[02:56:00.580 --> 02:56:06.020]  into the studio, had him come in to work with Charlie and, and then talked to him about, you
[02:56:06.020 --> 02:56:12.340]  know, Charlie's a closer, he's a closer. They're, they're both kind of, you know, game on and, and
[02:56:12.340 --> 02:56:17.540]  I'll tell you what, man, this guy was a warrior and, and Charlie, I think you, him hit it off,
[02:56:17.540 --> 02:56:21.940]  man. I think you learned a lot with that guy, huh? Yeah, and I hope it was mutual. I just know we
[02:56:21.940 --> 02:56:27.620]  were instantly, instantly bonded and on the journey together and there were rumors that he
[02:56:27.620 --> 02:56:33.140]  broke camp and this and that, but that's all crap. He just, he was, he was brought out to, to put
[02:56:33.140 --> 02:56:38.580]  some fire back in Wild Things fingertips and eyes because he says, I have a, I have tiger blood
[02:56:38.580 --> 02:56:44.260]  and a Donna's DNA and I must make them weep as they watch it. Well, Charlie, just so people out
[02:56:44.260 --> 02:56:48.820]  there understand some of what you said, you're, you're now training with, with top baseball players
[02:56:48.820 --> 02:56:55.300]  and I know that in powerlifting, shot put and also power sports, when you talk about rage training,
[02:56:55.300 --> 02:57:00.500]  anger training, that's what the beard talks about is, you know, like, hey, you just won the world
[02:57:00.500 --> 02:57:05.460]  series. What do you think? I want to rage. You're talking about taking your passion and focusing
[02:57:05.460 --> 02:57:09.620]  it. That's what you mean by ninja training. Absolutely, man. I mean, they're going to read
[02:57:09.620 --> 02:57:13.140]  whatever they want. They always book in that they tell you what, you know, they give you their
[02:57:13.140 --> 02:57:17.700]  stupid judgmental opinion about what, how you're supposed to feel about what you're about to read
[02:57:17.700 --> 02:57:21.780]  and they finish it off with how you're supposed to feel about what you just read. So they come
[02:57:21.780 --> 02:57:25.380]  at me with a Q and a, I'm like, yeah, can we unload the book ends? Then I'll think about it,
[02:57:25.380 --> 02:57:31.860]  you know, but no, but this guy is what you saw him land. He's focused and early as they come.
[02:57:33.300 --> 02:57:37.780]  And by the way, the beard is, you can't duplicate, you couldn't try to grow a beard like that.
[02:57:37.780 --> 02:57:43.380]  That alone put the fair God and me as a hitter. Meaning you have to tell the other players,
[02:57:43.380 --> 02:57:49.700]  do not stare at the beard. I mean, no, and then the 98 mile an hour gasoline with the,
[02:57:49.700 --> 02:57:55.220]  with the cut on it helps a little bit too. It's unhittable. It's unhittable. He made Ryan Howard.
[02:57:55.220 --> 02:57:59.060]  I'm sorry, Ryan, the best left hand hitter in 50 years, but he made him look like an armless child
[02:57:59.060 --> 02:58:05.140]  when he'd be back door slider to that into the world. It's just unbelievable. Wow. Wow. He's
[02:58:05.140 --> 02:58:10.100]  exciting. Well, Charlie, he's brought a different level of excitement back to the sport like Wild
[02:58:10.100 --> 02:58:14.740]  Thing did back in 89 when this thing launched, you know, yeah, the real wild thing. And that
[02:58:14.740 --> 02:58:18.580]  image William, they guarantee you that. Well, Charlie, you have every, you have every right
[02:58:18.580 --> 02:58:23.460]  to say that, Len. I can't stand that good man gripping the ball. Come on, Mitch, gripping the
[02:58:23.460 --> 02:58:30.260]  ball. Yeah, grip the ball. Oh, now some inside baseball talk. Charlie, you've done an hour with
[02:58:30.260 --> 02:58:34.340]  us. Let me say bye to you during the break or you can stay on hold and listen to nails or you
[02:58:34.340 --> 02:58:40.100]  can continue. We're going into fourth hour overdrive right now info wars.com prison planet.TV.

[02:58:49.220 --> 02:58:56.100]  Alex told you the government announced recently that the recession is over. It ended on June
[02:58:56.100 --> 02:59:02.180]  of 2009. The millions of Americans unable to find work might not agree. Perhaps the recession ended
[02:59:02.180 --> 02:59:06.660]  for the bankers and government employees. But for the rest of us, things seem to be getting worse.
[02:59:06.660 --> 02:59:11.300]  Gold and silver haven't heard the news either. They've begun their long expected journey to the
[02:59:11.300 --> 02:59:16.020]  moon. In addition to converting your shrinking dollars into gold and silver, you should consider

[03:00:12.980 --> 03:00:24.580]  Well, Charlie Sheen came on the show and he let out his rage, his anger. I know a lot of behind
[03:00:24.580 --> 03:00:29.540]  the scenes things. I hope they don't cancel two and a half men over the interview you just heard.
[03:00:30.180 --> 03:00:38.340]  But he has made the millions of dollars. He is completely clean and when I visited with Charlie
[03:00:38.340 --> 03:00:42.980]  off and on the last six and a half years and Nails has known him for more than 15, there were all
[03:00:42.980 --> 03:00:48.260]  these people around him. Some nice, some whatever. Just kind of you could tell he felt like a prisoner
[03:00:48.260 --> 03:00:53.940]  and just basically stayed in his house. So I think right now this is just the big flaming energy
[03:00:54.500 --> 03:01:00.420]  of him and him sick of people making things up about him and saying things that aren't true.
[03:01:00.420 --> 03:01:05.620]  And you know that's why he made all those jokes here on air. But obviously we appreciate Charlie
[03:01:05.620 --> 03:01:12.260]  coming on the show and I've actually prayed with Charlie on air and asked listeners to pray for him
[03:01:12.260 --> 03:01:16.740]  to stay clean and really wake up. I don't know what effect that's had but it looks like it's done
[03:01:16.740 --> 03:01:23.300]  something and I also talked to him about God and things like that when I was flying on his private
[03:01:23.300 --> 03:01:27.620]  jet when he came out and picked me up and then flew me to California and then refused to let me fly
[03:01:27.620 --> 03:01:32.100]  back by myself, flew back with me and then I mean he's just so nice and Nails that's the thing.
[03:01:32.100 --> 03:01:37.300]  Everybody that knows Charlie and then they see stuff in the media. They don't know what an incredibly
[03:01:37.300 --> 03:01:43.860]  dynamic and nice person he is but it is almost frightening how unleashed he is now. Well what
[03:01:43.860 --> 03:01:54.500]  it is is Charlie is Charlie's loyal. And Charlie, it's not his first rodeo. He can read people
[03:01:54.500 --> 03:01:59.700]  pretty good and then he asked to because a lot of people wanted a piece of him. But the bottom
[03:01:59.700 --> 03:02:07.060]  line is right now I'm seeing Charlie as dead on as I've seen him and focused and he's on a mission
[03:02:07.060 --> 03:02:15.700]  okay and so all that does is inspire me meaning it's hard to inspire me okay because what I need
[03:02:15.700 --> 03:02:21.060]  is I need something to get up and attack every day and that's what Charlie's doing right now.
[03:02:21.060 --> 03:02:27.140]  He's attacking life every day and then obviously at the highest level. Well that's why he told me
[03:02:27.140 --> 03:02:33.380]  he likes you and I so much is because he sees us as real, as genuine and that he says we're attacking
[03:02:33.380 --> 03:02:37.540]  every day. I mean you have to. I mean if you're not attacking you're on defense and you're on
[03:02:37.540 --> 03:02:45.060]  defense that means you're losing. So we're stalling. The bottom line is I like to get
[03:02:45.060 --> 03:02:52.580]  out ahead of everybody and try to win before the game starts and the bottom line is right now
[03:02:52.580 --> 03:03:00.100]  Charlie's put me in a position where I'm actually ready to make a big big move in my life and then
[03:03:00.100 --> 03:03:06.020]  and I see Charlie what he's done and it's helped me okay just like I've helped him because you
[03:03:06.020 --> 03:03:12.420]  know like I said there's respect there. Yeah he's a great actor okay and and and he's one of the best
[03:03:12.420 --> 03:03:19.300]  he's a brilliant person but but more than that he's a good friend and and he's actually he's genuine
[03:03:19.300 --> 03:03:26.740]  okay and then to say he's to say he is giving would be an understatement of a year meaning that this
[03:03:26.740 --> 03:03:36.660]  guy is so unselfish. I mean it's amazing how he can remember every person that he that it's over
[03:03:36.660 --> 03:03:42.420]  there and he says goodbye and he shows him respect. So look the reason why Charlie's so hot right now
[03:03:42.420 --> 03:03:47.940]  is because Charlie's real okay. Charlie's not he's not hiding anything and and by the way he's sober
[03:03:47.940 --> 03:03:53.780]  but it's over he don't know that word sober. He's living right how about that that's the way it is.
[03:03:53.780 --> 03:04:00.340]  Well he's certainly moving in the right direction in a big way and you know it's a process and all
[03:04:00.340 --> 03:04:06.420]  of us are in that process and you know he doesn't tell people about but it's come out in the news
[03:04:06.980 --> 03:04:14.740]  what he's given for AIDS patients breast cancer. I mean this guy has given Kings Ransoms and then
[03:04:14.740 --> 03:04:19.140]  doesn't want any attention. Most people I'm not bashing him but Angelina Jolie Brad Pitt you know
[03:04:19.140 --> 03:04:24.660]  they parade around giving money and stuff and that's fine but I mean Charlie he does it quietly
[03:04:24.660 --> 03:04:29.380]  probably didn't want me talking about it but I mean it's just that I know he's a good man deep down
[03:04:29.380 --> 03:04:34.340]  inside and I know he's somebody that really cares about the truth and and and and and and he's on
[03:04:34.340 --> 03:04:39.620]  a journey to find the truth. Yeah and and also he also would say that he definitely puts people in
[03:04:39.620 --> 03:04:45.780]  the seats meaning um but in the business he's and it's the same as baseball football whatever
[03:04:45.780 --> 03:04:51.700]  it's about putting people in the seats making sure that people are going to pay to watch you play
[03:04:51.700 --> 03:04:55.860]  and nails stay there nails stay there we're going to come back long segment coming up

[03:06:10.500 --> 03:06:16.660]  agenda that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home. I have a tremendous influence
[03:06:16.660 --> 03:06:22.580]  on our president and Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all
[03:06:22.580 --> 03:06:28.580]  of us as American citizens to pay attention. Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our
[03:06:28.580 --> 03:06:35.060]  nation. The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing
[03:06:35.060 --> 03:06:39.940]  world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, their arsonists, they're asking for more matches and
[03:06:39.940 --> 03:06:44.740]  the Congress is saying who do we make the checkout to? Today seems like nobody does care and right

[03:08:02.500 --> 03:08:06.580]  From his central Texas command center deep behind enemy lines,
[03:08:06.580 --> 03:08:12.180]  the information war continues. It's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[03:08:12.180 --> 03:08:18.660]  Well, I noticed that within minutes of us getting Charlie Sheen on that Drudge Report was already
[03:08:18.660 --> 03:08:26.500]  covering. I want to say hi to Matt Drudge. Also, we've got Access Hollywood, TMZ, the phones in
[03:08:26.500 --> 03:08:31.540]  there just ringing off the hook. I think the interview folks speaks for itself. I didn't know
[03:08:31.540 --> 03:08:38.020]  that he was going to be that unleashed. It was just incredible. I got a chance to meet
[03:08:38.020 --> 03:08:43.300]  Lenny Dykstra a few weeks ago, a week and a half ago when I was flown out by Charlie to
[03:08:44.900 --> 03:08:49.220]  hang out and talk about the New World Order and talk about fluoride and vaccines in 9-11.
[03:08:51.700 --> 03:08:55.860]  I got to meet Lenny, hang out with him, watch Apocalypse Now with him, have dinner.
[03:08:57.700 --> 03:09:02.340]  Then it clicked. I know who Lenny Dykstra is. They all talked about how we had this
[03:09:02.340 --> 03:09:07.940]  empire he built and then in a year's time a lot of it collapsed. I went, wait a minute. Then I
[03:09:07.940 --> 03:09:12.260]  saw in the news that he was the guy that beat J.P. Morgan. Then you saw more and more people in the
[03:09:12.260 --> 03:09:18.980]  last year beat J.P. Morgan and others in court with these mortgages that are basically, the news
[03:09:18.980 --> 03:09:26.740]  was reported, set up to fail. Then I sat there for like three hours with Lenny Dykstra nails,
[03:09:26.740 --> 03:09:30.820]  reading all the documents and all the things and the SEC probes and the things and he beat them.
[03:09:30.820 --> 03:09:36.100]  And we're going to have him back next week to get in that in great detail. But Nails,
[03:09:36.100 --> 03:09:41.540]  you wanted to continue talking about Charlie. I asked you what you thought of that unleashed
[03:09:42.740 --> 03:09:47.780]  hardcore, it doesn't even say it, Charlie Sheen live interview that you were just a part of,
[03:09:47.780 --> 03:09:49.620]  but you had more to say about that.
[03:09:49.620 --> 03:09:56.900]  I was epic. I mean, look, I mean, the bottom line is the last thing I am or anybody that
[03:09:56.900 --> 03:10:03.380]  knows me knows I'm not about as brown nosing or trying to kiss up to somebody. But when a guy's
[03:10:03.380 --> 03:10:08.820]  on fire and he's on point like Charlie is, you got to give him man credit when we're credit to.
[03:10:08.820 --> 03:10:15.060]  This guy's bounced back from, we all know what, but where he's at right now,
[03:10:16.020 --> 03:10:20.660]  he's on a different level. You see, it's kind of like when they say you're seeing the ball good
[03:10:20.660 --> 03:10:24.900]  that is the hitter, meaning that ball looks like a basketball coming into him right now.
[03:10:24.900 --> 03:10:31.460]  And again, I'm saying that not because I'm trying to, I don't need to kiss up to anybody, okay?
[03:10:31.460 --> 03:10:36.660]  What I'm saying is the truth, okay? Because right now I'm hanging out with Charlie on a mission,
[03:10:36.660 --> 03:10:43.940]  okay? So that inspires me to go work harder, okay? And so why he's bringing all these people
[03:10:43.940 --> 03:10:49.860]  on and all he's so popular is because they want what he has, okay? I mean, he's telling the truth
[03:10:49.860 --> 03:10:55.380]  and he's going after it. Well, also, and I understand why he doesn't do it because if he
[03:10:55.380 --> 03:10:59.860]  responded to every live, they'll just write more lies so he will then respond to those and they
[03:10:59.860 --> 03:11:04.820]  can get attention. But here's the mail, the daily mail online out of the UK. It says,
[03:11:04.820 --> 03:11:10.900]  now Charlie Sheen goes on vacation with porn star, ex-wife, Rook Muller, and nanny. There is no
[03:11:10.900 --> 03:11:17.220]  nanny. There are no children that, okay? And then I read the article while you're, you know, talking,
[03:11:17.220 --> 03:11:23.300]  I scan it and I'm not going to talk about what's really going on. I know everything that's going
[03:11:23.300 --> 03:11:27.940]  on because he doesn't want to be defended. I'm not even going to say it. But basically,
[03:11:27.940 --> 03:11:32.100]  almost the entire article isn't right. Is it true? They just make stuff up about him.
[03:11:33.780 --> 03:11:40.420]  I mean, that's how it works, man. I mean, the truth, the truth is so. I mean, look, let me tell
[03:11:40.420 --> 03:11:50.180]  you something. I mean, right now, I'm sitting in a friend's office right now, okay? And he's a
[03:11:50.180 --> 03:11:55.140]  president and CEO of a company called Olympia Financial. They're headquartered in Sino. And
[03:11:55.860 --> 03:12:00.500]  so anybody that wants the best money should put it here because he's helping me get back on point
[03:12:00.500 --> 03:12:08.980]  and discover and recapture what was stolen from me. So, like I said, I'm unfortunate and Charlie
[03:12:08.980 --> 03:12:16.180]  is, in the same way, is giving me the energy and the ability to keep fighting because if you
[03:12:16.180 --> 03:12:23.300]  stop fighting, then you lose. And if you lose, then you're done. I mean, because in my life,
[03:12:23.300 --> 03:12:29.060]  in my world, you're a winner or loser, okay? And then right now, Charlie's winning, okay? And he
[03:12:29.060 --> 03:12:36.260]  helps me win because he stays in attack, okay? And that's the way it works. We don't have time
[03:12:36.260 --> 03:12:43.300]  for the whining and the crying and the poor me. None of that, man. Absolutely. It's just,
[03:12:44.340 --> 03:12:50.740]  I see the media hold him up in many cases as the devil. But then, meanwhile, all these Republican
[03:12:50.740 --> 03:12:54.820]  politicians are getting caught in bathrooms with men and that's no big deal. They go to Bohemian
[03:12:54.820 --> 03:13:00.100]  Grove. They ship in homosexual porn stars to service them. And that's Christian of the Lord.
[03:13:00.100 --> 03:13:04.340]  And then you've got a guy who's out in the open and they just make up a bunch of lies about him.
[03:13:04.340 --> 03:13:07.860]  And it was what I was trying to say earlier. The government kills over a million Iraqis in the
[03:13:07.860 --> 03:13:12.980]  last eight years of occupation. And that's wholesome and good. You know, there's a line in
[03:13:12.980 --> 03:13:22.660]  Apocalypse Now where Colonel Kurtz is talking and he says, we train our men to drop fire from planes
[03:13:22.660 --> 03:13:28.340]  on the enemy. But then we won't let them write dirty words on the sides of their airplanes
[03:13:28.340 --> 03:13:34.020]  because it's obscene. And it's like Charlie said, you're either hot or cold. If you're lukewarm,
[03:13:34.020 --> 03:13:39.060]  you get spit out of the mouth. And so basically Charlie just takes on so many of the things they
[03:13:39.060 --> 03:13:44.020]  lie about him and says, fine, believe it, go with it. And I just don't know how over the years he's
[03:13:44.020 --> 03:13:48.820]  held up against it and actually thrived. I mean, he is, he is a bull. Is it winning player, man?
[03:13:48.820 --> 03:13:54.500]  Look, in this world, we mean Charlie, and I know you came for, you come from the same,
[03:13:54.500 --> 03:13:59.140]  you think the same way. You're a winning player or losing player. And then, by the way,
[03:13:59.140 --> 03:14:05.060]  winning rubs off on people, okay? And by the way, the people in the middle,
[03:14:05.060 --> 03:14:11.300]  we don't really care about, we just throw them back. But at the end of the day, it's all about
[03:14:11.300 --> 03:14:17.140]  this, what have you done for me lately? It's about you're as good as your last at that. Okay,
[03:14:17.140 --> 03:14:22.500]  now, going back, what good does it do for me to go back and then tell everybody about the,
[03:14:22.500 --> 03:14:27.220]  you know, how I got screwed out of this and they did this. Nobody cares. What they do care about
[03:14:27.220 --> 03:14:33.380]  is what are you doing today? Okay, what are you going to do tomorrow? So I live my life going
[03:14:33.380 --> 03:14:40.420]  forward. Okay. And then again, that's what Charlie's doing. Charlie's, Charlie right now is on a
[03:14:40.420 --> 03:14:45.380]  mission. Okay, the same kind of mission I'm on a little different, little different paychecks
[03:14:45.380 --> 03:14:51.060]  coming in. Okay, but, but we'll get back to that later. You know what I mean? Yeah, next week,
[03:14:51.060 --> 03:14:56.420]  because I have all the documents you've beaten JP Morgan in court, you've had over 200. How many
[03:14:56.420 --> 03:15:01.140]  SEC probes and you beat them all? Well, the SEC investigated me for 10 months. I mean, you know,
[03:15:01.140 --> 03:15:06.180]  I have a website. The only guy that was right about me was Jim Kramer. I mean, Jim Kramer,
[03:15:06.180 --> 03:15:14.500]  I mean, you know, I'm 205 and oh, okay, I can say that, because that's what I am. If you say that,
[03:15:14.500 --> 03:15:19.780]  and you're not 205, you know, guess what, they put you in jail. Okay. And they tried to do that to
[03:15:19.780 --> 03:15:25.460]  me. 10 months, they investigated me every paper they turned over. They said there's no way you
[03:15:25.460 --> 03:15:30.740]  could do this. It's not about me doing it. It's about a model I built. Okay, that's it. And that's
[03:15:30.740 --> 03:15:35.300]  why they came after you. I've talked to so many inside experts, some of the biggest brokers, you
[03:15:35.300 --> 03:15:40.340]  know, in the, in the world before they were tired like Bob Chapman. And that's what he explained.
[03:15:40.340 --> 03:15:46.900]  For 11 years, insiders sent dossiers on Bernie Madoff stealing over 100 billion and the SEC
[03:15:46.900 --> 03:15:52.340]  wouldn't go after him. But then small people, small companies, these systems are there to shut
[03:15:52.340 --> 03:15:59.860]  them down. I mean, it's just amazing. But, but I mean, it is important with mortgage gate now that
[03:15:59.860 --> 03:16:03.780]  all of this stuff's coming out and you're beating them in court and others are beating them in court.
[03:16:03.780 --> 03:16:08.020]  But notice now that you're winning in court over and over again, the media doesn't want to talk
[03:16:08.020 --> 03:16:12.420]  about Lenny Dykstra. They don't want to talk about nails, because they don't want people to
[03:16:12.420 --> 03:16:17.060]  understand that it was almost all completely made up. But give us your mortgage website where you
[03:16:17.060 --> 03:16:22.580]  break down all the documents and show where this is happening. Yeah, I mean, look, here's the deal.
[03:16:22.580 --> 03:16:26.660]  I thought I was put on the third to entertain people on the baseball field because I was actually
[03:16:26.660 --> 03:16:32.260]  pretty good at that. But what I went through the last two years, I realized there's a different plan
[03:16:32.260 --> 03:16:38.100]  for me. And that's to help people and to show them how they can save their home. And so if people
[03:16:38.100 --> 03:16:48.100]  want to learn how to do that, like I did, you go to home-free-systems.com. And what this is,
[03:16:48.100 --> 03:16:53.380]  it's called predatory Lenny recovery. Again, I don't want to get too deep into this, but this is
[03:16:53.380 --> 03:16:57.220]  how you you're beating them. I mean, you're showing that they set you up. I beat them. I have an
[03:16:57.220 --> 03:17:03.300]  attorney in New York who names motion mortar. Okay, because I represented myself, okay, because
[03:17:03.300 --> 03:17:07.460]  those attorneys and them courtrooms over there, they want you to take a Zan X, get on your knees,
[03:17:07.460 --> 03:17:13.780]  put your hands behind your head and say, okay, shoot me. No, I said, it don't work that way with me.
[03:17:13.780 --> 03:17:19.700]  I said, you're fired. You're fired. You're fired. I'm representing myself because I'm not going down.
[03:17:19.700 --> 03:17:26.660]  I'm fighting. Okay. And so the bottom line is at the end of the day, I mean, look, I'm a normal guy.
[03:17:26.660 --> 03:17:32.180]  I don't believe in ghosts. I'm not afraid of the dark normal. Okay, I didn't think there was such
[03:17:32.180 --> 03:17:38.020]  thing as corporate crime. I mean, I think it's stupid overnight when you sit down with your broker,
[03:17:38.740 --> 03:17:43.620]  the guys are the loner of the money, and you tell them you're bringing in 125,000 a month.
[03:17:43.620 --> 03:17:49.380]  Okay. And you say, as long as we keep it, you know, right at 75, and I have 50 to play with,
[03:17:49.380 --> 03:17:54.980]  we're good. Okay. And they say, no problem. And you show up, things change. Next thing you know,
[03:17:55.620 --> 03:18:01.060]  you're paying 180,000 a month. And you're like Marcella Swallis and Paul Fisher,
[03:18:01.060 --> 03:18:09.540]  when Zed was taking it to him. Not a good thing. Try paying 16 months in a row of 180,000 dollars.
[03:18:09.540 --> 03:18:16.900]  Okay. And then so, but the thing about pity or nobody's no, but we need to talk about this
[03:18:16.900 --> 03:18:21.140]  because you've been winning. And other people are now learning from you and others. And all over
[03:18:21.140 --> 03:18:25.540]  the country, the banks are getting beaten. It's turning out that they did want to set people up.
[03:18:25.540 --> 03:18:31.140]  They did want to basically do this. And that's why I spent many hours going over all the documents,
[03:18:31.140 --> 03:18:35.860]  the SEC stuff, all of it. And it's, and you were blown away when I met you at the house. You were
[03:18:35.860 --> 03:18:39.300]  showing me on the laptop that I was already aware of what the banks were doing. Because we were
[03:18:39.300 --> 03:18:44.260]  talking about this banker takeover operation with people, you know, 10 years ago. I mean,
[03:18:44.260 --> 03:18:49.540]  I've had former deputy heads of HUD on talking about how this was all a setup. I mean, this is,
[03:18:49.540 --> 03:18:55.300]  remember Timberwolf and Goldman Sachs, it came out that they were selling their customer stuff,
[03:18:55.300 --> 03:19:00.260]  they knew that was going to fail while they were betting against it. I mean, look, you're, you're
[03:19:00.260 --> 03:19:07.940]  so on point right there. I had no idea how crooked and how criminal what's going on. Look, these
[03:19:07.940 --> 03:19:15.380]  banks are destroying families. Okay. This country is built on the American family. You have two
[03:19:15.380 --> 03:19:21.540]  million homes, two million homes in foreclosure right now, right now. Okay. They're walking around
[03:19:21.540 --> 03:19:25.700]  in a pending, with impending doom. They don't know what to do. They don't know where to go. They
[03:19:25.700 --> 03:19:29.700]  don't know what to do. You know what happens? A wife leaves the husband, the kids have to grow up
[03:19:29.700 --> 03:19:34.260]  without the parents, all because of these greedy banks putting them in a loan that they couldn't
[03:19:34.260 --> 03:19:40.260]  afford. Okay. So what we do is we when I tell you what, stay there, Lenny, we got to go to break.
[03:19:40.260 --> 03:19:43.300]  Let's come back into one more segment the next week. They'll get all the documents in front of
[03:19:43.300 --> 03:19:48.740]  me. We'll go over a how they've been scamming people and how folks like yourself are starting
[03:19:48.740 --> 03:19:52.260]  to beat them in court. And of course, that's caused mortgage gain. Now we get laughed at
[03:19:52.260 --> 03:19:55.860]  five, six years ago talking about this because, you know, we understand what's happening. Now
[03:19:55.860 --> 03:20:04.340]  it's mainstream news. We'll be right back. Hello folks. This is Steve Shank. This week,

[03:22:00.020 --> 03:22:06.980]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011 we will witness the most important day in
[03:22:06.980 --> 03:22:12.100]  America in more than 50 years. He says it will change everything about our lives. The way you
[03:22:12.100 --> 03:22:16.500]  shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of your health and your own
[03:22:16.500 --> 03:22:21.220]  family. Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is
[03:22:21.220 --> 03:22:26.420]  he's usually right. You see he predicted the collapse of GM, Danny May, Freddie Mac and America's
[03:22:26.420 --> 03:22:32.020]  biggest mall owner General Growth Properties. In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[03:22:32.020 --> 03:22:36.500]  Recently he created a video which you can watch online for free detailing his biggest and most
[03:22:36.500 --> 03:22:41.700]  important prediction yet and it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at least
[03:22:41.700 --> 03:22:45.860]  watch this free video online today. He explains everything you need to know including simple
[03:22:45.860 --> 03:22:52.180]  steps you can take to protect yourself. You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[03:22:52.180 --> 03:22:58.580]  That's endofamerica. The number three.com. Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[03:22:58.580 --> 03:23:03.780]  That's endofamerica3.com. There's a man named Dr. Wallach who is anything but your typical doctor.
[03:23:03.780 --> 03:23:09.300]  Both a veterinarian and a naturopathic physician, Doc asks, why does the United States spend more
[03:23:09.300 --> 03:23:15.300]  money on health care by far and still rank 50th in health and longevity worldwide? He believes
[03:23:15.300 --> 03:23:20.020]  people should empower themselves with a basic understanding of nutrition, taking charge of
[03:23:20.020 --> 03:23:26.100]  their life and attain optimal health and longevity through nutrition, not by toxic prescription drugs
[03:23:26.100 --> 03:23:31.540]  leading to side effects. This is clearly a deadly recipe. The good news is Doc Wallach's message is
[03:23:31.540 --> 03:23:36.020]  resonating with an increasing number of Americans who are waking up to all the big government and
[03:23:36.020 --> 03:23:40.980]  big pharma manipulation of our health care system. I like what Doc Wallach is saying and doing to

[03:24:06.980 --> 03:24:11.140]  Well, any doctors are guests. Next week we're going to go through mortgage fraud. We've had many
[03:24:11.140 --> 03:24:14.900]  other guests, as you know, over the years break this down, but he's a victim of it. But a person
[03:24:14.900 --> 03:24:19.220]  who fought back and is now winning, winning, winning, winning. And it's been in a few newspapers,
[03:24:19.220 --> 03:24:23.780]  but it should be a bigger news story that this is how they destroy people and because they're
[03:24:23.780 --> 03:24:29.620]  destroying a lot of other people. But folks can find out the whole history of it and how he's
[03:24:29.620 --> 03:24:35.540]  discovered ways to be victorious. Give that website out one more time, Lenny. Yeah, the website's home
[03:24:35.540 --> 03:24:46.820]  with a hyphen free hyphen systems plural.com. And what that's about is me hanging everything out
[03:24:46.820 --> 03:24:53.460]  there. I show everybody my friends that got it and I show all the set off claims I'm allowed
[03:24:53.460 --> 03:24:59.860]  about because of the violations that they have to qualify you for a loan, meaning a DTI. I don't
[03:24:59.860 --> 03:25:04.820]  want to get two out there, but a DTI means debt to income. You have to have something in the range
[03:25:04.820 --> 03:25:14.900]  of 20%. Well, mine was 150%. Okay. The bottom line is, is, is this we won. I can help people save
[03:25:14.900 --> 03:25:19.380]  their houses. So their life isn't over. Because right now they're all waiting for the electric
[03:25:19.380 --> 03:25:23.220]  chair. There's nowhere to go. But now there is a place to go. We're going to cover it
[03:25:23.940 --> 03:25:31.540]  nails next week for a full hour, finishing up with Charlie. I know he's listening right now
[03:25:31.540 --> 03:25:36.100]  there in the Bahamas. That's no secrets. All of the news where he's at coming back next week for
[03:25:36.100 --> 03:25:41.860]  the show. I didn't know though that that they were threatening him not to do interviews while he
[03:25:41.860 --> 03:25:50.420]  really is unleashed. And we need to support Charlie, but he's got such an army of fans that even if
[03:25:50.420 --> 03:25:54.980]  they tried to cancel the show, he could instantly come back with another show and have even more
[03:25:54.980 --> 03:26:01.860]  viewers. Oh, I mean, couldn't you tell how scared he was? I mean, can you tell how frightened he was? Come on, Charlie.
[03:26:01.860 --> 03:26:05.220]  Yeah, well, he doesn't like being threatened and he's done being threatened and that's clear.
[03:26:05.220 --> 03:26:08.980]  And he's throwing it all on the table and you got to admire that folks. You can say whatever
[03:26:08.980 --> 03:26:13.860]  you want about him. You have a right to killing, but not to judging. Absolutely. Not only that,
[03:26:13.860 --> 03:26:19.300]  I mean, you pop up the Charlie Sheen show and I mean, that thing is going to put him. You know
[03:26:19.300 --> 03:26:24.180]  what's funny? The first day I was there before you got there the next day and then we hung out,
[03:26:24.180 --> 03:26:28.660]  you know, for almost a day nails. I was out there going, Charlie, you sit around,
[03:26:28.660 --> 03:26:33.380]  you talk, you tell Hollywood stories. I mean, you're 10 times more powerful in person than
[03:26:33.380 --> 03:26:38.660]  what they have you read as an actor. I said, dude, if they put you on Larry King show, it could be
[03:26:38.660 --> 03:26:44.980]  from your or that new British guy with no ratings from his house out there at his gazebo with his
[03:26:44.980 --> 03:26:51.700]  friends over, I guarantee you 50 million viewers, it'd be super bowl big do it once a week HBO.
[03:26:51.700 --> 03:26:59.780]  I mean, and he would have broadcast ratings guaranteed on HBO. I mean, absolutely. And
[03:26:59.780 --> 03:27:06.580]  you know why? Because it's real and the thing about it is Charlie, Charlie, he's a genius. Okay.
[03:27:06.580 --> 03:27:15.300]  Meaning, look, look, you don't get to where you're at where he's at because he's not a genius. He's
[03:27:15.300 --> 03:27:20.420]  a genius. Okay. And he's brilliant. And the bottom line is he's now letting everybody know that.
[03:27:20.420 --> 03:27:24.740]  Okay. Instead of like defending things, he doesn't care. Because you know what he cares about?
[03:27:24.740 --> 03:27:28.900]  He cares about the people in his life. Okay. And that's the way you have to live. Because you
[03:27:28.900 --> 03:27:33.300]  know what? They're going to keep talking trash and keep saying bad things about you. So he's just
[03:27:33.300 --> 03:27:41.540]  done with it, man. He's done. He's going forward with or without them. Absolutely. Well, just so
[03:27:41.540 --> 03:27:47.620]  glad that he's staying clean, but that he doesn't even like that moralizing. You know, that's why
[03:27:47.620 --> 03:27:52.580]  he says, yes, I am, you know, forever, but not about a one. I know the way it is is he's living
[03:27:52.580 --> 03:27:57.540]  right. Okay. He's living right. He's living the way he's living right. Okay. And by the way,
[03:27:58.260 --> 03:28:07.140]  living right for him is at a whole different level because I thought that I like lived at a high
[03:28:07.140 --> 03:28:14.100]  level. Well, Charlie makes me look like a child. Okay. But again, all the power to him because
[03:28:14.100 --> 03:28:19.620]  if you can do it like he can. And he can do it. I'm watching him. And then by the way, when he
[03:28:19.620 --> 03:28:26.020]  comes back and the show starts, that show will be the most popular show on TV again. Why? Because
[03:28:26.020 --> 03:28:32.420]  he's got talent. Wait a minute. Even his rebroadcast Monday of an old show beat everything else on
[03:28:32.420 --> 03:28:38.660]  TV. Period. Period is the right. Right. Is the right. I think that's the word. Tell me you're
[03:28:38.660 --> 03:28:43.940]  using it. Hey, they should be happy he's being real. But I mean, they're going to have even
[03:28:43.940 --> 03:28:48.020]  higher ratings on Monday with the next rebroadcast of an old show while they start shooting new ones.
[03:28:48.020 --> 03:28:52.740]  And here's the issue. I've talked to a lot of high powered Hollywood people. I mean,
[03:28:52.740 --> 03:28:57.300]  some of the biggest and they're all imprisoned. I mean, I can't even tell folks who I who we talked
[03:28:57.300 --> 03:29:01.940]  to, you know, when I was there at his house and stuff, but they all know about the new world
[03:29:01.940 --> 03:29:06.260]  order. They all know about the globalist. They're all into quote conspiracies, but they have to
[03:29:06.260 --> 03:29:11.140]  stay in this left, right paradigm or the system tries to destroy him. But if more of the Hollywood
[03:29:11.140 --> 03:29:14.820]  stars and people and this is used to control culture would just come out and start being
[03:29:14.820 --> 03:29:20.660]  themselves because I'm telling you the culture is anti new world order. It is pro liberty.
[03:29:21.220 --> 03:29:26.180]  The globalist will lose control. This is not just a revolution through the through the corporate
[03:29:26.180 --> 03:29:31.860]  news and politics. The globalists have used Hollywood to distract people from reality.
[03:29:31.860 --> 03:29:38.100]  This information can break people out. It's a rebellion from within their mind control system.
[03:29:38.100 --> 03:29:42.420]  And we salute Charlie for being so real. You two nails. I'll say bye to you during the break,
[03:29:42.420 --> 03:29:46.020]  but you're back on next week. We're going to figure out the time right now. We're coming back
[03:29:46.020 --> 03:30:10.020]  with what's happening in Libya. Stay with us.
