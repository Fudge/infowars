[00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.831]  It's a political talk.
[00:00:01.831 --> 00:00:07.335]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:07.335 --> 00:00:12.459]  Waging war on corruption, crashing the lies and disinformation.
[00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:25.150]  We've had the Mexican Attorney General call and carrying out the order for all of his employees to get into the secure areas to take implantable microchips.
[00:00:26.016 --> 00:00:33.479]  We have Andy Rooney calling for the forced implantation of the population with microchips to, quote, tell who the good people are.
[00:00:33.479 --> 00:00:35.500]  We have the Army calling for it.
[00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:41.462]  We have all these TV shows promoting it to get into the newest club or to be cool.
[00:00:41.462 --> 00:00:49.065]  And one of our listeners, Eric, actually got the clip off CNN, thank God, that so many callers have been calling in about.
[00:00:49.065 --> 00:00:50.806]  And this happened just a few hours ago.
[00:00:51.593 --> 00:01:01.916]  And this is where Roberts is being questioned by a senator about forced implantable microchipping.
[00:01:01.916 --> 00:01:05.016]  And so let's go ahead and play that clip.
[00:01:05.016 --> 00:01:06.657]  Here it is, in your face.
[00:01:06.657 --> 00:01:11.198]  Stop then and it must not stop now, Judge.
[00:01:11.198 --> 00:01:14.399]  And we'll be faced with equally consequential decisions in the 21st century.
[00:01:16.129 --> 00:01:20.492]  A microscopic tag be implanted in a person's body to track his every movement.
[00:01:20.492 --> 00:01:22.633]  There's actual discussion about that.
[00:01:22.633 --> 00:01:27.436]  You will rule on that, mark my words, before your tenure is over.
[00:01:27.436 --> 00:01:33.520]  Can brain scans be used to determine whether a person is inclined toward criminality or violent behavior?
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.742]  You will rule on that.
[00:01:36.742 --> 00:01:40.664]  And Judge, I need to know whether you will be a justice of belief.
[00:01:40.664 --> 00:01:41.825]  That's it, Alex.
[00:01:42.398 --> 00:01:43.199]  Well, good job.
[00:01:43.199 --> 00:01:43.840]  Mail me that.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:59.575]  And the point here is that it's so out in the open, it's being pushed so hard, that in a confirmation hearing for Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, he's saying, will you forcibly make people take chips?
[00:01:59.575 --> 00:02:01.657]  And what did you think when you saw that?
[00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:12.992]  Basically, it let me know that those who think they're in charge of this country and this world have taken their gloves off and putting it right in our face.
[00:02:12.992 --> 00:02:13.393]  They are.
[00:02:13.393 --> 00:02:15.333]  They're a bunch of out-of-control devils.
[00:02:15.333 --> 00:02:18.314]  I mean, they're just... Could there be any doubt?
[00:02:18.314 --> 00:02:20.274]  Not in my mind.
[00:02:20.274 --> 00:02:23.935]  Well, listen, I appreciate your hard work and thanks for playing that for us.
[00:02:25.535 --> 00:02:26.475]  Take care, my friend.
[00:02:26.475 --> 00:02:29.296]  Anything else you wanted to add, Eric?
[00:02:29.296 --> 00:02:30.617]  No, that's basically it.
[00:02:30.617 --> 00:02:37.640]  I did get a video clip of the Concord Bush going through New Orleans today in his military convoy.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.520]  Please send that to me as well.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:40.741]  Okay, I sure will, Bay.
[00:02:40.741 --> 00:02:41.881]  Thank you so much.
[00:02:41.881 --> 00:02:49.024]  And again, I need you listeners to take the news, to isolate the particular key things, to send it to me because
[00:02:50.032 --> 00:02:53.357]  It's a task just to watch it.
[00:02:53.357 --> 00:02:55.479]  It's a task just to try to put it on television.
[00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:59.164]  It's a task to try to comment on it.
[00:02:59.164 --> 00:03:06.233]  That's why I get a little bit frantic and hectic sounding and afraid at the edges because it's just there's so much evil coming down on us.
[00:03:06.233 --> 00:03:07.415]  Now let me play some of these clips
