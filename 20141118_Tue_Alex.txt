[00:00.000 --> 00:13.440]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.440 --> 00:34.320]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:34.320 --> 00:43.400]  Jonathan Gruber a name the establishment wishes we'd all forget it's only been
[00:43.400 --> 00:49.400]  what a week and a half or so since the first video of Gruber now there's like
[00:49.400 --> 00:56.360]  eight of them since the first video of Gruber they're advising staff at his
[00:56.360 --> 01:03.800]  MIT alma mater on how they deceive the American people their enemy and giggling
[01:03.800 --> 01:09.280]  and smirking about the enjoyment and how easy we are to feed on cuz we're so
[01:09.280 --> 01:23.000]  stupid yes like the wicked witch of the east now a video comes out of Obama
[01:23.000 --> 01:27.800]  praising him saying that he literally people are sick of me using the term
[01:27.800 --> 01:34.120]  literally well Obama Obama says I literally no figure of speech stole the
[01:34.120 --> 01:44.200]  Obamacare plan from her grubber now that was a couple years ago that too on
[01:44.200 --> 01:50.400]  C-span in the last two days Obama came out and said he doesn't really know
[01:50.400 --> 01:56.120]  Gruber he's a nobody not part of his staff when he met at the White House now
[01:56.120 --> 02:02.920]  at least 15 times first it was 10 times and 12 times 15 times with the
[02:02.920 --> 02:08.720]  president and he brags about how they came up with the lies together in fact
[02:08.720 --> 02:13.400]  guys are so many clips I know it gets confusing let's get the clip of Romney
[02:13.400 --> 02:17.560]  praising him to show how it's bipartisan tyranny and why the Republican
[02:17.560 --> 02:24.360]  leadership doesn't want to get rid of it and then I want to show the the the
[02:24.360 --> 02:29.800]  Gruber clip where he brags that he met behind closed doors with Obama and that
[02:29.800 --> 02:33.760]  Obama simple I can't let him know it's gonna cost all this money he said don't
[02:33.760 --> 02:38.440]  worry here's how you do it and so then they learned how to hide it from people
[02:38.440 --> 02:43.480]  he's bragging about my lie got picked I'm the best liar you realize I'm so
[02:43.480 --> 02:49.080]  smart I got paid $400,000 to come up with this scam one part of the larger
[02:49.080 --> 02:54.600]  latrine of lies so we have that cesspool going on and then you've got
[02:54.600 --> 03:02.460]  Gruber being thrown over the bus by Obama it's a Rosetta stone it's a
[03:02.460 --> 03:06.760]  skeleton key that there are stories every day that do this but this one is so
[03:06.760 --> 03:16.160]  illustrative of the dishonorable rat-like behavior of these people it is
[03:16.160 --> 03:24.440]  truly mind-blowing mind-boggling that they're doing it in front of everyone
[03:24.440 --> 03:28.040]  because hey look just because roughly half the public can't find their butt
[03:28.040 --> 03:31.520]  with both hands doesn't know their head from a hole in the ground doesn't know
[03:31.520 --> 03:35.520]  the three branches of government doesn't know who their daddy is or their mommy
[03:35.520 --> 03:42.200]  is and doesn't care do you realize that of the other 50% about 30% are somewhat
[03:42.200 --> 03:48.920]  awake and are starting to wake up more maybe maybe 15% of that number are
[03:48.920 --> 03:53.360]  really awake and then we're waking up the other 20 30% that are somewhat awake
[03:53.360 --> 03:59.720]  it only takes 5% to bring a criminal group down you guys are a few thousand
[03:59.720 --> 04:05.080]  globalists running this scam and we've got let's be conservative 50 million
[04:05.080 --> 04:19.800]  super awake 150 million somewhat awake I've studied history scum and I've
[04:19.800 --> 04:23.240]  studied how you guys always think you're invincible and corrupt elites I don't
[04:23.240 --> 04:28.160]  care if it's in China or the Middle East or Rome or Europe or Asia or Latin
[04:28.160 --> 04:32.960]  America it's the same story Africa you guys always think you're invincible and
[04:32.960 --> 04:39.040]  you always go too far like Wiley Cout runs out on that cliff and looks and you

[04:42.520 --> 04:48.040]  and you guys don't have a parachute I know you got nuclear weapons and stuff
[04:48.040 --> 04:51.880]  and hey you'll probably end up causing a nuclear war to keep your power and kill
[04:51.880 --> 04:56.120]  everybody I understand that but maybe we can stop you from destroying humanity
[04:56.120 --> 05:02.480]  just maybe scum the government's Department of Homeland Security is

[09:10.200 --> 09:15.280]  declared yesterday afternoon by the governor protester has car stolen
[09:15.280 --> 09:20.400]  during the F the police rally so the criminals are using the demonstrations
[09:20.400 --> 09:27.600]  as cover university issues students tips on demonstrating a CNN and MSNBC are
[09:27.600 --> 09:32.640]  really telling a one-sided story trying to incite people I was watching it last
[09:32.640 --> 09:37.480]  night this morning and I just report what I see I mean I really am into not
[09:37.480 --> 09:42.320]  having a bias that I get accused of bashing the police a lot only when we
[09:42.320 --> 09:46.000]  see him execute somebody in cold blood like in Albuquerque where the homeless
[09:46.000 --> 09:49.360]  guys unarmed and they they kill him and laugh at him let the dog chew his dead
[09:49.360 --> 09:54.240]  body and then the squad car videos released 20 minutes before with the cop
[09:54.240 --> 09:58.520]  who'd been kicked off the state police saying I'm gonna kill this effort I'm
[09:58.520 --> 10:03.960]  gonna shoot him right in the testicles and the other cops are like really he's
[10:03.960 --> 10:08.800]  like yeah I'm gonna kill him just want to just kill some homeless guy you need
[10:08.800 --> 10:14.000]  to be in a mental institution not with a badge and a gun and the police have
[10:14.000 --> 10:17.000]  shot our reporters rubber bullets and they've done stuff it's wrong but the
[10:17.000 --> 10:21.120]  criminal gangs trying to organize rioting nationwide if this cop isn't
[10:21.120 --> 10:25.560]  indicted it's just an excuse to carry out criminal activity and the feds are in
[10:25.560 --> 10:31.960]  there provocaturing it behind the scenes that is the Justice Department is and
[10:31.960 --> 10:37.240]  then the government will get more power to federalize out of this crisis
[10:37.240 --> 10:48.240]  Darren Wilson supporters pay for hashtag pants up don't loot
[10:48.240 --> 10:56.400]  billboard for kill the Jerusalem synagogue attack gun controls east for
[10:56.400 --> 11:00.760]  self-defense Palestinians celebrate the streets yeah the answer is arm
[11:00.760 --> 11:04.840]  yourselves and Israel's been bringing in more gun control the last few years
[11:04.840 --> 11:12.480]  that's now being attacked the answer is obviously for people to be armed and then
[11:12.480 --> 11:16.480]  they can protect themselves from someone wielding a butcher knife killing four
[11:16.480 --> 11:20.040]  what's the answer ban butcher knives England's actually talking about it
[11:20.040 --> 11:23.520]  that's some of the stories on drudge report calm we have some of the same
[11:23.520 --> 11:27.560]  stories on info wars dot com fact here's one of the headlines that ties into
[11:27.560 --> 11:34.400]  Ferguson st. Louis cop says and there's video get a gun we can't protect you
[11:34.400 --> 11:41.040]  Paul Watson has a video breaking that down race war in Ferguson despite
[11:41.040 --> 11:49.840]  outcome on Darren Wilson protests organizers emphasize racial character
[11:49.840 --> 11:55.400]  of anticipated protest and threat posed to white people yeah there's a lot of
[11:55.400 --> 11:58.560]  calls and now racial attacks are intensifying have a stack of news of
[11:58.560 --> 12:03.320]  whites being attacked because they're quote white this is just ridiculous it
[12:03.320 --> 12:08.040]  will create more division and more racism and will swell the ranks of the
[12:08.040 --> 12:12.360]  Klan I mean it's just what the feds want a prison economy we're all divided
[12:12.360 --> 12:16.640]  like a giant prison a woman receives beating because she's a quote white
[12:16.640 --> 12:21.920]  girl in the hood we have that report anonymous has leaked a map of federal
[12:21.920 --> 12:27.720]  perimeter around Ferguson we have the audio Missouri governor goes silent
[12:27.720 --> 12:35.440]  when asked who's in charge in Ferguson that's some really big important news
[12:35.440 --> 12:40.120]  up on info wars dot com only a small fraction of it one of the other articles
[12:40.120 --> 12:46.080]  is offshore foreign banks vow to fight Republican efforts to repeal Obamacare
[12:46.080 --> 12:54.920]  and that is out of the Washington examiner tens of billions of dollars in
[12:54.920 --> 12:58.640]  fact last time I checked it was over 12 billion dollars they were reporting just
[12:58.640 --> 13:03.720]  spent by lobbying groups not just by unions and others to get the affordable
[13:03.720 --> 13:07.800]  care act what an Orwellian name passed and that's what I'm gonna shift gears
[13:07.800 --> 13:13.360]  into now then it a huge news on the Russia front and I mean huge news insurers
[13:13.360 --> 13:17.840]  will strenuously resist Republican efforts to dismantle Obamacare well
[13:17.840 --> 13:25.760]  that's why bipartisan Lee all the blue blood rhino neocon the anti-gun pro
[13:25.760 --> 13:34.080]  global warming republicans helped write Obamacare now now granted people like
[13:34.080 --> 13:39.880]  a manual and people like Gruber Jonathan Gruber is a killer manual they added
[13:39.880 --> 13:46.080]  layers of filthy icing to it the Massachusetts plan was a royal screw
[13:46.080 --> 13:52.120]  job written up by Romney the insurance companies but compared to what the
[13:52.120 --> 13:56.360]  republicans brought forward the democrats added heaping helpings of
[13:56.360 --> 14:01.960]  evil and because the republicans I want to play ball and their big donors are
[14:01.960 --> 14:05.360]  large foreign banks and insurance companies most of them foreign want to
[14:05.360 --> 14:10.200]  point that out through their US subsidiaries have taken us over this is
[14:10.200 --> 14:16.160]  the biggest tax increase hands down even the CBS says tax increase in the US
[14:16.160 --> 14:21.160]  history and the government gets part of the money and the insurance companies
[14:21.160 --> 14:24.800]  get the other it creates more regulations were small insurance companies
[14:24.800 --> 14:30.520]  are shutting down it is a monopolistic oligopoly insider crony capitalist
[14:30.520 --> 14:37.200]  system at the top at the bottom it's death panels it is ration care it is
[14:37.200 --> 14:42.080]  government control of your records and your life and they're just spreading your
[14:42.080 --> 14:47.080]  records everywhere massive identity theft total fraud and it's all on purpose
[14:47.080 --> 14:53.400]  as a psi-op to see what they can get away with I mean we got up here with
[14:53.400 --> 14:58.680]  medical doctors scientists medical managers constitutional lawyers we read
[14:58.680 --> 15:03.160]  the subsections of the bill thousands of pages and then they added more than
[15:03.160 --> 15:08.760]  10,000 pages of writers and we would read the subsection where they set up the
[15:08.760 --> 15:12.440]  death panels the bioethics panels that would not give you care and what they're
[15:12.440 --> 15:16.280]  already doing at the VA and where they created 21 new taxes seven of them on
[15:16.280 --> 15:20.800]  people at or below the poverty line payroll taxes the list goes on and on
[15:20.800 --> 15:24.760]  and it was clearly designed to wreck health care and then Ezekiel a manual
[15:24.760 --> 15:28.800]  comes out on Fox and goes yeah it is and then Bill Gates comes out and says yeah
[15:28.800 --> 15:32.680]  it is a death panel we have those clips we played them probably 50 to 100 times
[15:32.680 --> 15:34.680]  a piece I don't know it's it's more than 50 times
[15:34.680 --> 15:41.800]  shall I play them again and the response was the libertarians and real
[15:41.800 --> 15:47.680]  conservatives out there world net daily drugs report info wars are racist their
[15:47.680 --> 15:53.080]  liars it isn't in the bill and Rachel Maddow and all these people would shake
[15:53.080 --> 16:02.600]  their fingers at the camera and say it's racist that Watson gown MSNBC called
[16:02.600 --> 16:08.280]  me racist all of them see it in it's a lie they don't want you to have free
[16:08.280 --> 16:14.160]  health care it's part of the racism well no we were reading the subsections on
[16:14.160 --> 16:19.200]  air and then now Jonathan Gruber comes out in eight different clips there now
[16:19.200 --> 16:24.000]  are and says I met with the president behind closed doors we had to come up
[16:24.000 --> 16:27.800]  with a way to hide the massive increases we developed a plan he picked my plan
[16:27.800 --> 16:32.240]  Obama now in a new video that surfaced from C-span years ago you know told
[16:32.240 --> 16:37.480]  Gruber how great he is and how he literally took stuff for the plan from
[16:37.480 --> 16:41.480]  Gruber as he says then Obama comes out and says no I didn't really know no
[16:41.480 --> 16:44.720]  Gruber I mean he advised some it wasn't part of the staff and you know I don't
[16:44.720 --> 16:48.440]  really know who he is throwing him under the bus and then we have met Romney
[16:48.440 --> 16:53.560]  endorsing Gruber in 2006 because remember he helped come up with some of the
[16:53.560 --> 16:59.880]  earlier stuff this is Massachusetts this is MIT Massachusetts Institute of
[16:59.880 --> 17:07.960]  Technology so it's one filthy nest of foreign insurance companies and banks
[17:07.960 --> 17:16.680]  who wrote a plan where you pay tax money to them so here's Romney praising
[17:16.680 --> 17:23.160]  Gruber in 2006 Romney care signing ceremony if you want to vomit here is
[17:23.160 --> 17:28.840]  that clip let me mention as well the legislators and staff who worked with the
[17:28.840 --> 17:36.040]  president and the speaker names like Murray Lee's more Walrath Mariano and
[17:36.040 --> 17:40.920]  Hargraves may not be as familiar as ours sitting here on the very front row but
[17:40.920 --> 17:45.760]  their work was every bit as dedicated and valuable there were contributors from
[17:45.760 --> 17:51.480]  outside government as you know Jonathan Gruber at MIT devoted hours and hours to
[17:51.480 --> 17:59.840]  an essential econometric model Jonathan Gruber at MIT okay Jonathan Gruber at MIT
[17:59.840 --> 18:06.440]  now let's go to Gruber saying that he met with Obama to hatch the conspiracy
[18:06.440 --> 18:10.800]  here it is real cost-control that we know it'll work go after this now the
[18:10.800 --> 18:14.320]  problem is it's a political nightmare and people say no you can't tax my
[18:14.320 --> 18:18.760]  benefits it feels like so what we did a lot in that room was think about well
[18:18.760 --> 18:22.840]  how could talk about well how could we make this work and Obama's like well you
[18:22.840 --> 18:26.520]  know I mean he's really a realistic eyes like look I can't just do this he said
[18:26.520 --> 18:29.560]  it's just not gonna happen politically the bill will not pass how do we manage
[18:29.560 --> 18:33.520]  to get there through phasins and other things and we talked about it um and he
[18:33.520 --> 18:37.240]  was just very interested in that topic and once again that ultimately came to
[18:37.240 --> 18:40.200]  Genesis of what's called the Cadillac tax in the healthcare bill which I think
[18:40.200 --> 18:45.040]  is enough let's just move on from that now let's go to Obama a few years ago
[18:45.040 --> 18:49.960]  praising Jonathan Gruber and saying that he liberally or literally took it from
[18:49.960 --> 18:54.640]  him and then we'll go to Obama saying he knows nothing and doesn't really know
[18:54.640 --> 19:00.880]  him here it is you've already drawn some of the brightest minds from academia and
[19:00.880 --> 19:06.840]  policy circles many of them I've stolen ideas from liberally people ranging from
[19:06.840 --> 19:12.960]  Robert Gordon to Austin Gulsby John Gruber my dear friend Jim Wallace here
[19:12.960 --> 19:17.520]  who can talk I think that's enough that's at the Brookings Institute the
[19:17.520 --> 19:22.640]  president on C-Span now let's go to Obama a few days ago saying oh Gruber was
[19:22.640 --> 19:28.760]  just a side deal he didn't really you know who's he here it is well I wonder
[19:28.760 --> 19:32.960]  how you square that with your former advisor Jonathan Gruber claiming you
[19:32.960 --> 19:37.160]  were not transparent about the health law because in his words the American
[19:37.160 --> 19:41.640]  people the voters are stupid did you mislead Americans about the taxes about
[19:41.640 --> 19:49.280]  keeping your plan in order to get the bill passed no I I did not I just heard
[19:49.280 --> 19:55.960]  about this yeah I get well briefed before I come out here the fact that some

[24:13.120 --> 24:20.560]  com studios I'm your host Alex Jones coming up today we have mr. Dent the
[24:20.560 --> 24:27.040]  economist joining us remember a bane capital being a mint romney Harry Dent
[24:27.040 --> 24:30.760]  couldn't join us last week because his mother died that's why he canceled the
[24:30.760 --> 24:36.400]  show very sad he'll be joining us today and then we are going to have our
[24:36.400 --> 24:43.040]  reporters pop in at 130 from Ferguson where the governor's declared a state of
[24:43.040 --> 24:48.160]  emergency and they're bracing basically for criminal groups race-based groups to
[24:48.160 --> 24:51.760]  use legitimate demonstrations it's the first amendment so you have a legitimate
[24:51.760 --> 24:55.360]  right to do that they're going to use that as cover to carry out criminal
[24:55.360 --> 24:59.560]  activity and the feds are clearly letting the organization of this be set up
[24:59.560 --> 25:04.720]  on Facebook and Twitter so they get more funding it's very shameful not blaming
[25:04.720 --> 25:09.680]  the average rank and fall fed out there because you can't do that but clearly
[25:09.680 --> 25:12.200]  just departments down there staring it out they got caught with the Trayvon
[25:12.200 --> 25:16.400]  Martin deal and maybe that'll change now that Eric Holders out of there soon to
[25:16.400 --> 25:19.400]  be out of there but I doubt it because that's all the establishment has is
[25:19.400 --> 25:24.240]  playing us off against each other that's truly a saddening situation so we'll
[25:24.240 --> 25:28.920]  give you a breakdown on that as it unfolds our reporters will be there huge
[25:28.920 --> 25:34.560]  news Putin says West is provoking Russia into new Cold War as spies deported US
[25:34.560 --> 25:38.040]  diplomats and others kicked out this is a major escalation that's coming up to
[25:38.040 --> 25:42.800]  start the next segment and we'll open the phones up and take your calls but
[25:42.800 --> 25:47.600]  getting back to Obama if you just tuned in so he played gripper saying he met
[25:47.600 --> 25:51.360]  behind closed doors and helped come up with a deception with Obama on the
[25:51.360 --> 25:55.800]  increases on quote taxing benefits we'll see they are they actually are going to
[25:55.800 --> 25:59.800]  get free stuff in this world and then they try to hide that it's gonna cost
[25:59.800 --> 26:03.360]  money but it's not even free stuff it's a giant screw job to foreign insurance
[26:03.360 --> 26:08.920]  companies true socialist health care has all its own nightmares but in a few
[26:08.920 --> 26:12.800]  countries it's administered okay not in England not in Canada certainly but a
[26:12.800 --> 26:16.320]  few northern European countries do a pretty good job because you're gonna
[26:16.320 --> 26:20.120]  you pay high taxes but you get pretty good health care this isn't socialist
[26:20.120 --> 26:29.040]  health care it's fascist screw job it's worse than socialism by the way those
[26:29.040 --> 26:32.240]  northern European countries do euthanize people though so they do have the death
[26:32.240 --> 26:36.680]  panel so it's it's it's bad in that respect it's just this is as bad as it
[26:36.680 --> 26:41.480]  gets nothing this horrible has ever been invented it's just a giant robbery
[26:41.480 --> 26:47.240]  system and then Obama you know goes out and praises gruber is one of the
[26:47.240 --> 26:54.440]  architects on video and then gets asked by a reporter at an event about it we're
[26:54.440 --> 26:57.320]  gonna play the whole clips that cut off by the break so you can hear it in
[26:57.320 --> 27:00.440]  context and he says listen you know this guy's not really one of our main
[27:00.440 --> 27:05.720]  advisors yes he is he came up with a whole bunch of it and that's been written
[27:05.720 --> 27:12.800]  about for years and Mitt Romney's praising and that's our problem is that
[27:12.800 --> 27:15.640]  Boehner and Mitchell and others will act like they're gonna repeal it now
[27:15.640 --> 27:18.720]  because of backlash when for two years they've been saying we're not gonna
[27:18.720 --> 27:23.040]  repeal it because they took money from the same interest for this okay so when
[27:23.040 --> 27:27.360]  you want to hate Obama that's fine what about John Boehner what about Mitch
[27:27.360 --> 27:33.200]  McConnell what about these Republicans scumbags I mean look if we can't repeal
[27:33.200 --> 27:37.040]  this whole thing and get some indictments we're dying this is an
[27:37.040 --> 27:42.920]  outrageous takeover my goodness with them bragging how they're cheating us and
[27:42.920 --> 27:48.640]  scamming us you want to live like they do at the VA folks it's been bad for a
[27:48.640 --> 27:52.120]  while but for the last six seven years they put them on secret death list I
[27:52.120 --> 27:56.000]  don't care if you're 25 or 75 you don't get knee surgery you don't get lung
[27:56.000 --> 27:59.720]  surgery you don't get brain surgery that's operable it's almost a hundred
[27:59.720 --> 28:03.680]  percent operable you get pills to go home and the brain tumor grows or the
[28:03.680 --> 28:08.880]  lung cancer grows and you die and every few days you see one of the reports on
[28:08.880 --> 28:15.200]  CNN it's like all the vet that got shot in his spine severed and you know now
[28:15.200 --> 28:18.440]  he just wants to starve himself because he's so unhappy after all these years it
[28:18.440 --> 28:21.920]  sounds sweet but the other report it goes other vets are coming home I just
[28:21.920 --> 28:26.760]  want to die too will we let them and the CNN voiceover guy breaks down at the
[28:26.760 --> 28:31.680]  earth will we let them I was watching that last night on online you see those
[28:31.680 --> 28:36.160]  reports every few days just let them die it's so beautiful and I was watching
[28:36.160 --> 28:41.720]  whatever CBS is with the Bilderberg group member Charlie Rose on it and it was
[28:41.720 --> 28:45.240]  like a woman who didn't know why she had inflammation and why Lou Gehrig's and ALS
[28:45.240 --> 28:48.880]  was exploding and she was 40 with a child and totally beautiful and a few
[28:48.880 --> 28:53.320]  years later you know is paralyzed from the neck down and then raised money for
[28:53.320 --> 28:57.680]  Lou Gehrig's and Lou raised money for ALS it's everybody's getting in and no
[28:57.680 --> 29:01.480]  discussion of did you take a vaccine honey because they're like I'm reading
[29:01.480 --> 29:09.680]  the closed caption when I'm on the the elliptical and I'm thinking inflammation
[29:09.680 --> 29:13.280]  on the brain chronic inflammation chronic inflammation they just call it
[29:13.280 --> 29:16.120]  Alzheimer's ALS if you're young whatever they got a bunch different
[29:16.120 --> 29:20.560]  neurological spectrums that they put out and I said inflammation on the brain
[29:20.560 --> 29:24.760]  inflammation on the brain and they go they show CAT scans and go we don't know
[29:24.760 --> 29:30.640]  why all these people show inflammation on the brain now MSG GMO vaccines we
[29:30.640 --> 29:35.240]  know exactly in the studies what's doing it but nobody's gonna tell people on
[29:35.240 --> 29:40.160]  CBS News it's the vaccine I bet money that woman I was watching this morning I
[29:40.160 --> 29:47.760]  bet money she gets a flu shot every year I bet money I bet my right arm I bet my

[33:28.880 --> 33:42.520]  moment you know I should apologize I shouldn't get upset by foreign mega banks
[33:42.520 --> 33:48.840]  about 80% of money you can look it up the Baker bailout went to them more than
[33:48.840 --> 33:54.000]  80% of the foreign money coming in to pass obama care is by foreign banks owned
[33:54.000 --> 33:59.040]  by people that don't even live here to make you double and triple your
[33:59.040 --> 34:05.520]  insurance or make you get insurance and we're only a year or two into this they
[34:05.520 --> 34:10.920]  say the sky's the limit they will raise it until we all go bankrupt and the
[34:10.920 --> 34:13.480]  government gets to find you and come after you and they get part of the
[34:13.480 --> 34:19.600]  money and I apologize watching one of the best healthcare systems in the world
[34:19.600 --> 34:24.160]  be wrecked watching a bunch of stupid welfare heads think they're about to
[34:24.160 --> 34:27.440]  get better healthcare when actually the free healthcare they've had is about to
[34:27.440 --> 34:32.640]  be taken away well they got lots of doctors in Cuba but you don't get eye
[34:32.640 --> 34:38.680]  surgery they give you a cane they got lots of doctors in England but when you
[34:38.680 --> 34:42.520]  need surgery for skin cancer they're gonna make you wait a year until you die
[34:42.520 --> 34:50.740]  in many cases oh they got lots of doctors in Canada but at the time they're
[34:50.740 --> 34:53.840]  gonna end up killing you in the government-run facilities we look it
[34:53.840 --> 34:59.320]  up but this isn't even socialist health care this is just a bunch of foreign
[34:59.320 --> 35:04.040]  interest coming in with along with the traitorous government to wreck the
[35:04.040 --> 35:09.160]  entire system to overthrow it to bring in national health care administered by
[35:09.160 --> 35:13.840]  private interest with only three insurance companies when they're done
[35:13.840 --> 35:19.120]  running the whole show and they're the big three that funded it a lot of small
[35:19.120 --> 35:22.560]  and medium insurance companies fought it just like the Texas Banking Association
[35:22.560 --> 35:27.040]  and other local banking associations around the country fought the Banking
[35:27.040 --> 35:31.960]  Reform Act and they head of the Texas Banking Association wrote a big article
[35:31.960 --> 35:34.720]  four years ago we read the whole thing on air it was in the Texas Business
[35:34.720 --> 35:41.040]  Journal I happen to see it republished in the Austin Business Journal saying
[35:41.040 --> 35:44.240]  this is a monopolistic conspiracy to shut down all the local banks that
[35:44.240 --> 35:48.840]  actually loan money and then the big mega banks are gonna close their local
[35:48.840 --> 35:52.000]  branches and aren't gonna give you loans because they don't need retail banking
[35:52.000 --> 35:57.480]  anymore they just get given QE unlimited money and they want you to not have
[35:57.480 --> 36:02.240]  money so you implode so they can buy up all your assets and property they want
[36:02.240 --> 36:06.320]  a depression so you better defeat this legislation well guess what they didn't
[36:06.320 --> 36:13.100]  defeat it that's going through now we're being conquered we're being laid
[36:13.100 --> 36:19.400]  waste right now we're being brought down right now you understand that those
[36:19.400 --> 36:26.440]  aren't words you are being robbed every paycheck now with the payroll tax
[36:26.440 --> 36:30.240]  going up you're being robbed with all the hidden taxes and the regulations and
[36:30.240 --> 36:34.320]  the fines you're being robbed because 2,000 major corporations were given
[36:34.320 --> 36:40.320]  total waivers to never get Obamacare but your company has to so you can't
[36:40.320 --> 36:46.160]  compete you're getting laid off because people can't afford to hire you now
[36:46.160 --> 36:49.440]  you're getting cut from full-time to part-time because of it it would take
[36:49.440 --> 36:56.280]  me hours to go over this entire scam and see in the old days Americans got
[36:56.280 --> 37:01.360]  upset about being pushed around or cheated nowadays it seems we can only
[37:01.360 --> 37:08.080]  go out and get angry if it's racial we can't even get mad when they try to ban
[37:08.080 --> 37:14.200]  Christianity and take down crosses everywhere Americans just haven't
[37:14.200 --> 37:20.160]  remembered who they were and we've lost our will to stand up for ourselves we've
[37:20.160 --> 37:27.240]  lost our dignity we've lost our fighting spirit but it can be regained and
[37:27.240 --> 37:34.120]  here's the message there's no bottom to the pit the sky's the limit of what
[37:34.120 --> 37:37.440]  these tyrants will do Thomas Jefferson said it over and over again the limit
[37:37.440 --> 37:40.880]  of tyranny you will live under he was asked by a newspaper reporter I'm
[37:40.880 --> 37:46.960]  paraphrasing his quote but maybe we can Google it Thomas Jefferson on the
[37:46.960 --> 37:52.440]  limits of tyranny the limit of tyranny is exactly the amount you will put up
[37:52.440 --> 37:56.920]  with you will accept that is what governs the tyrant I believe that's the
[37:56.920 --> 38:03.520]  exact quote that is what governs the tyrant they don't govern themselves
[38:03.520 --> 38:09.280]  Hitler couldn't govern himself he started attacking everybody declared war on
[38:09.280 --> 38:16.160]  England war on the US war on France war on Czechoslovakia war on Poland war on
[38:16.160 --> 38:24.800]  the Soviets yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah cuz that's what people like
[38:24.800 --> 38:32.080]  him do you get bad people in charge on power trips they no no bounds they run
[38:32.080 --> 38:38.000]  wild till they get stopped and the globalists have jumped the shark over and
[38:38.000 --> 38:42.440]  over and over and over and over and over again so I want to open the phones up
[38:42.440 --> 38:48.920]  specifically on this question phones are now open I asked Obamacare supporters
[38:48.920 --> 38:52.760]  to call in after it became wall last year and we saw the increases start and
[38:52.760 --> 38:55.840]  some actually called in and made fun of me and said that they were getting
[38:55.840 --> 39:00.560]  something free others were fake people calling in acting like NPR zombies but I
[39:00.560 --> 39:06.040]  want to open the phones up for people that it has anybody had their premium
[39:06.040 --> 39:13.640]  lowered I know of no one I know of a few people that are already on welfare that
[39:13.640 --> 39:17.080]  went into the hospital they called it Obamacare when they got the free
[39:17.080 --> 39:21.040]  Medicare or Medicaid that was always there now they just watered down the
[39:21.040 --> 39:26.120]  quality I want to hear from you are I mean are you upset with Gruber or am I
[39:26.120 --> 39:30.160]  still a conspiracy theorist telling you this was all in there I want to hear from
[39:30.160 --> 39:35.760]  Obama supporters out there I know you're listening I know you exist if you know
[39:35.760 --> 39:39.920]  I've got you've got an Obama phone in your hand or a fake bleeding heart you
[39:39.920 --> 39:44.160]  know liberal social worker and because you're not a bad person yourself you
[39:44.160 --> 39:47.200]  then project that on to the establishment and believe it's your
[39:47.200 --> 39:54.920]  mommy and you're under its little wings like a ducky like a Gosling you're not
[39:54.920 --> 40:01.440]  under a loving mother Goose's wings I will assure you stop being a moron
[40:01.440 --> 40:07.920]  shmuck that's a great word a chump I want to hear from you I'll try to be
[40:07.920 --> 40:14.120]  polite do you have the bravada do you have the will to call in here I want to
[40:14.120 --> 40:18.080]  hear how I'm wrong I want to hear how Jonathan Gruber didn't mean what he said
[40:18.080 --> 40:28.040]  look here's the toll free number 800 259 92 31 800 259 92 31 I'm gonna say it
[40:28.040 --> 40:32.360]  slow because Obama listeners may not have ever called in Obama supporters
[40:32.360 --> 40:35.920]  we're on a lot we're on affiliates all over big cities all over the country
[40:35.920 --> 40:44.840]  Oklahoma City Chicago Austin you know Southern California Kansas City just I
[40:44.840 --> 40:48.840]  mean we're on almost 180 affiliates I know you're out there listening call in
[40:48.840 --> 40:53.240]  I hear you bashing me on other shows I randomly tune into I'm like the byword to
[40:53.240 --> 40:56.760]  call in and go no bombacare is not that bad what are you a black helicopter 10
[40:56.760 --> 41:00.320]  well hat wear like Alex Jones
[41:01.080 --> 41:08.400]  800 259 92 31 I'm gonna get into Russia get a quick update in Ferguson we'll
[41:08.400 --> 41:12.200]  have a full report at 130 from Jacarie Jackson there and Joe Biggs we're gonna
[41:12.200 --> 41:15.160]  get like a quick couple minute report right now they'll get into Russia and
[41:15.160 --> 41:21.560]  then take your phone calls 800 259 92 31 let's go ahead and see what Jacarie
[41:21.560 --> 41:25.600]  Jackson has to say on the ground in Ferguson Jacarie still any word on
[41:25.600 --> 41:28.320]  when we're gonna get this verdict I know you're right in front of the courthouse
[41:28.320 --> 41:33.640]  no we have no word as of yet we were checking the streets last night we were
[41:33.640 --> 41:37.720]  in Ferguson as well as well as Clayton and the streets were pretty quiet we
[41:37.720 --> 41:41.240]  actually had more media out there than any other people it's pretty cold I
[41:41.240 --> 41:44.520]  think the temperatures are keeping people at bay but we see him governor
[41:44.520 --> 41:47.480]  Nixon he's making the moves I'm pretty sure he's getting everything in
[41:47.480 --> 41:52.080]  position to announce the that the verdict announced he wants to mobilize the
[41:52.080 --> 41:56.480]  National Guard we haven't seen them on the streets as of yet not much police
[41:56.480 --> 42:00.720]  presence at least not a visible police presence as of yet well they don't want
[42:00.720 --> 42:06.760]  to probably on the surface be provocative or seen as provocateurs just like
[42:06.760 --> 42:10.120]  we caught the feds massing and even CNN's reporting they fired the guy that
[42:10.120 --> 42:14.560]  shot the video of that and took the photos just outrageous tyranny but you
[42:14.560 --> 42:18.320]  can better believe Jacarie if you go to the National Guard Armories and check
[42:18.320 --> 42:23.360]  I'll bet my bottom dollar there they're waiting right now and that you can find
[42:23.360 --> 42:26.720]  groups of state police and others quietly masked if they're about to
[42:26.720 --> 42:31.280]  announce the verdict but so are you saying it's gonna be today or tomorrow I
[42:31.280 --> 42:35.280]  mean is that the feeling well you know they keep us drinking us along because
[42:35.280 --> 42:38.400]  we heard a lot of people say over the weekend it was gonna be Monday and now
[42:38.400 --> 42:42.680]  it's Tuesday and we still don't have any official word as to when it's going to
[42:42.680 --> 42:46.000]  come out well the cold weather I think we'll keep a lot of people off the
[42:46.000 --> 42:49.560]  street I'm all for the first amendment demonstrating but this is definitely a
[42:49.560 --> 42:54.400]  sigh up and needs to be de-escalated my view I mean I think they should just go
[42:54.400 --> 42:57.720]  ahead and announce it don't you think Jacarie yeah I think it would be a good
[42:57.720 --> 43:00.280]  thing just to go ahead and get it out the way especially you know they have the
[43:00.280 --> 43:03.640]  cold temperatures on their side it's supposed to warm up slightly throughout
[43:03.640 --> 43:07.920]  the week so if they want to keep the the the street presence to a minimum this
[43:07.920 --> 43:12.520]  would be the ideal time anything else you want to add we'll get a full detailed
[43:12.520 --> 43:17.160]  report from Biggs and you at the bottom of the third hour well speaking about
[43:17.160 --> 43:21.920]  Governor Nixon he was asked by a reporter yesterday during a teleconference
[43:21.920 --> 43:25.200]  you know who exactly was in charge of the operation because he had previously
[43:25.200 --> 43:30.360]  come out and stated during his state of address his his document there the state
[43:30.360 --> 43:35.400]  of emergency rather that the Ferguson this the St. Louis County Police
[43:35.400 --> 43:39.120]  Department would be running the ground operations in Ferguson but when he was
[43:39.120 --> 43:42.400]  asked by a reporter who was me running pretty much the whole shebang he kind
[43:42.400 --> 43:45.720]  of stuttered and mumbled and didn't really want to answer the question which
[43:45.720 --> 43:48.400]  I thought was very interesting because I thought it's pretty cut and dry in the
[43:48.400 --> 43:51.680]  the document that he gave out earlier but when he was asked that specific
[43:51.680 --> 43:56.520]  question and it's a great question but whoever asked that that journalist he
[43:56.520 --> 44:00.160]  couldn't really answer exactly who is running the ground operation so I thought
[44:00.160 --> 44:04.040]  that was very curious and I'm curious to see what's going to happen because we
[44:04.040 --> 44:08.440]  have seen a DHS presence here in the St. Louis area that's actually while we're
[44:08.440 --> 44:13.440]  out here right now where downtown St. Louis Joe Biggs got a tip that there's
[44:13.440 --> 44:17.320]  some DHS vehicles around here one of the parking garages it's a pretty much a
[44:17.320 --> 44:20.440]  shot in the dark we've looked at a few already but there's plenty of parking
[44:20.440 --> 44:23.240]  garages all right well that's the capital behind you keep inspecting
[44:23.240 --> 44:26.880]  Jacari and we'll get a full report from you at the bottom of the hour we have
[44:26.880 --> 44:30.400]  the audio of the governor it's a question of one and Guardian asked him but
[44:30.400 --> 44:35.400]  he just bumble so bad it's almost unintelligible clearly he doesn't want to
[44:35.400 --> 44:39.840]  get the blame if things go wrong and he doesn't want folks to know that DHS is
[44:39.840 --> 44:44.640]  pretty much calling the shots and when things go wrong DHS will end up trying
[44:44.640 --> 44:48.800]  to blame the state so maybe that's why he was caught like a deer in the
[44:48.800 --> 44:53.680]  headlights thank you Jacari here is that audio clip of the governor
[44:53.680 --> 45:09.520]  thank you given that you've declared the state of emergency put the highway patrol on the unified command does the bug ultimately stop with you when it comes to how many protests or police
[45:09.520 --> 45:36.520]  we're you know it's our goal here is to keep the peace and allow folks voices to be heard and in that balance I'm attempting you know I am using the resources we have to marshal to be predictable for both those pillars
[45:36.520 --> 46:05.520]  I can't listen to it he just goes on babbling the entire time trying to pass the buck what a mess everybody's got to be a PR expert nowadays so just be a straight shooter yeah I'm the governor I'm ultimately in charge of these emergency situations but we're coordinating with the feds and the locals and you know try to get together and decide what the best move is so it's a group effort but of course in the final equation the buck stops with me so I'm doing the best job I can that's how a governor talks right there
[46:05.520 --> 46:34.520]  not the way that guy just talked and I'm not even attacking him it's just that I'm so sick everybody trying to be a PR wonk until we're just a nation of baloney salesman I'm gonna get to Russia coming up I want to go ahead and go to some Obama supporters right now we've got two of them Joseph in Kansas Johnny in Missouri open lines for Obama supporters we never have open lines this is just for Obama supporters 800 259 92 31
[46:34.520 --> 46:57.520]  are you proud of Jonathan Gruber are you proud of Obama do you like the free goodies because they're not free do you still think he's your lord and savior as Jamie Fox calls him Joseph in Kansas you're up first go ahead
[46:57.520 --> 47:16.520]  yeah I'm the Obamacare my plan really hasn't moved or anything it's just it's about stay the same it's about the only thing I mean Obama I mean I don't really hate the guy he doesn't even get to choose what color tie he wears
[47:16.520 --> 47:37.520]  my everybody needs to be spending their time supplying up getting ready red alert red alert it's here wake people up it's not a game hold on as just a second Obama is a puppet but he's an active globalist and Obama the name Obamacare this whole movement to break the country
[47:37.520 --> 47:47.520]  you've heard it's increasing prices for most people you've heard about the death panels I'm sure you've heard Gruber admit they lied to people do you still support Obamacare
[47:47.520 --> 48:09.520]  I mean I didn't have any party I didn't really know what it was until after it came out all we've been worrying about is getting the militia together and getting going okay I appreciate your call there's a Obama supporter
[48:09.520 --> 48:19.520]  I should have asked him is it an Obama militia Johnny in Missouri you're on the air go ahead you say you're an Obama supporter
[48:19.520 --> 48:25.520]  yeah but that Obama militia scares me to death Alex I've got to be honest with that one
[48:25.520 --> 48:39.520]  well he did say he created a national security force just as big and just as strong as our military and then they have all the kids in Chicago in the military outfits doing Obama worship chance so maybe that's the answer
[48:39.520 --> 48:56.520]  well the problem is the average IQ is only about what 55-60 I mean well the average IQ is supposedly 100 but that's the median but it has been dropping because of fluoride so the average IQ used to be about 100 60-70 years ago it's about 90 right now
[48:56.520 --> 49:05.520]  mental retardation is 70 if you have a 60 IQ you have trouble talking so no the average person has about a 90 IQ now
[49:05.520 --> 49:10.520]  well yeah but they had 85 at the cutoff point for DHS and
[49:10.520 --> 49:16.520]  well when I first heard it 15 years ago that departments have a secret rule that cops can't have over 100 IQ I didn't believe it
[49:16.520 --> 49:28.520]  then cops won lawsuits who were either released or not hired because they had high IQs that yes under federal guidelines to get money you're not to hire an officer with over 100 IQ
[49:28.520 --> 49:34.520]  and because they found that they will question illegal orders so yes they basically want robots
[49:34.520 --> 49:39.520]  now to get back to the point to be in the Obama supporter
[49:39.520 --> 49:43.520]  I didn't support his first term okay
[49:43.520 --> 49:54.520]  over the course of those four years I realized that he has been the biggest shot in the arm for American national patriotism that this country has ever experienced
[49:54.520 --> 50:07.520]  we've had more gun cells more ammunition cells more people waking up to the defunct situation our government has become over what Alex 150 years yes
[50:07.520 --> 50:13.520]  so he's done more to put the people at least shake them awake
[50:13.520 --> 50:21.520]  you know like you said would you go into the hospital and they they tell you well we'll give you a kidney transplant but you're gonna have to wait six years
[50:21.520 --> 50:30.520]  I would think that would be a big wake up call so yeah I'm an Obama supporter I voted Democrat this cycle just to scare the hell out of the Republicans
[50:30.520 --> 50:38.520]  see if they would wake up and I'm a strong supporter of the National Liberty Alliance family we've got a mighty front coming forward
[50:38.520 --> 50:45.520]  now I hear you and you know that's actually I'm not saying you're communist you're the opposite that's a communist tactic make it worse to get people mad
[50:45.520 --> 50:52.520]  and so you're right I mean either they're gonna win with Obama and take over and break the country or they bit off more than they could chew
[50:52.520 --> 51:18.520]  we got more Obama those those coming up Michael Tony Ron and others stay with us

[57:29.520 --> 57:43.520]  a father of lies Muslims love him look what he's doing for all the Muslim states out there I mean definitely since he's come into power ISIS is certainly on their way to Israel so that's great for all those Muslim
[57:43.520 --> 57:55.520]  countries out there that that can't stand Israel and only that but I mean what's the matter Alex you don't like Mexican you don't like Saudi Arabia moving against all the states out there that don't force to

[01:00:26.520 --> 01:00:41.520]  we're going to take some calls from Obama supporters most other people calling in big sarcastic unfortunately then economists is joining us we're going to play a mashup John bound put together of Obama's fraud on Obamacare at the start of the next
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:51.520]  segment pretty powerful stuff to stay with us for the premiere of that Tony in Pennsylvania another Obama supporter let's see if you're being satirical go ahead
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:57.520]  no I'm I'm in favor of Obama he's keeping this evil corporation going
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.520]  and explain how that works
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:06.520]  well because if you know he they know obviously people are waking up now so they need someone like him to keep this corporation going
[01:01:06.520 --> 01:01:21.520]  they gotta let the illegals in you gotta entice them so then you can make them citizens so you can print currency off of their new citizenship he's trying to keep this all going they they absolutely know that the wakeups happening and they're trying to they're trying to manage the crisis
[01:01:21.520 --> 01:01:34.520]  that's right by bringing in a hundred million I mean it's it's just off the chart it's not 60 million people that will be total government minions they are in a desperate mode right now and you think that's great trying to turn us into a third world country
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:46.520]  and not that but what's the alternative with because the people are too dumb to ever try to actually look into what's going on I mean you got yourself who absolutely knows what's going on and you know a handful of others but everyone else they they don't have a clue
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:55.520]  they just follow like the Pied Piper so as soon as they start getting bad thinking everything's fixed they're gonna act like maniacs
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:02:03.520]  I mean it's not a country it's a corporation so if I was gonna have an evil evil corporation he'd be my CEO
[01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:18.520]  well that is true that there was an old tale I forget what culture comes out of the wise king and an evil witch came and poisoned the well in the in the fortress town there at the castle and made her by turn evil
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:29.520]  so what did the wise king do he went and he drank from the poison well and became evil himself because if I was to teleport back to the Aztecs a thousand years ago and say hey don't chop your children's hearts out they would think I was crazy
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:44.520]  so I guess it's true like if I was in Nazi Germany in 1941 and said Hitler's bad they'd kill me I mean or if I said Stalin was bad in 1955 so I guess you've got a point two plus two does equal five thank you Tony I apologize I've been evil
[01:02:44.520 --> 01:02:49.520]  Joseph in Colorado you say you're a Lord and Savior Obama supporter go ahead
[01:02:49.520 --> 01:03:00.520]  okay I'm just partially not really an Obama supporter I'm just saying and how he's really turning us into communist Russia Nazi Germany and I really think he's turning this country into crap
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:09.520]  all right well we're taking Obama supporters thank you for the call Jay in Georgia do we have any real Obama supporter that knows how to dial a telephone
[01:03:09.520 --> 01:03:14.520]  maybe he gave them telephones to teach folks how to use telephones Jay are you there
[01:03:14.520 --> 01:03:19.520]  yes you hear me yes do you really support our king
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:24.520]  here's my question about this I might be a little uninformed
[01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:43.520]  I was told that the governors were responsible for extending Medicaid and Medicare and for instance here in Georgia Nathan Deal did not extend that and that is what's causing a lot of this cost to go up and Obama's getting the blame for it
[01:03:43.520 --> 01:03:49.520]  sir they wrote the bill for foreign insurance companies to screw everybody
[01:03:49.520 --> 01:04:03.520]  and then now he says that's not his intent do you understand that some of the architects admit it was meant to bankrupt things and meant to increase your prices and they deceived you does the gruber video mean anything or the the Emanuel video
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:13.520]  yeah it does but my question is what about the governor's responsibility extended Medicare and Medicaid
[01:04:13.520 --> 01:04:16.520]  but what pays for that
[01:04:16.520 --> 01:04:19.520]  I don't know that's all I said I might be uninformed
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:34.520]  well listen here's the deal big corporations a lot of times want a big government program because they can administer and make money and it's guaranteed like chase runs the most the welfare programs in this country so they lobby for more welfare
[01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:41.520]  you can't just have free stuff it's taking it for somebody else giving it to others then it creates dependency and society falls apart
[01:04:41.520 --> 01:04:51.520]  so my point is is Obamacare was written to bankrupt the country but you're a real Obama supporter I want to come back to you if you've got more to say we're gonna go to break
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:56.520]  we've got another caller Matt in Oklahoma stay with us

[01:08:12.520 --> 01:08:28.520]  you name it you see Warren Buffett talking about it we see Donald Trump saying that we're about to go off the edge of the cliff I know he's been saying for a long time that's Harry Dent he's coming up in a moment to balance the hour
[01:08:28.520 --> 01:08:46.520]  first off though I want to play a special report John bound put out illustrating the fraud of Obamacare that is beginning to collapse in front of our very eyes and I don't think blue blood Republicans are establishment insiders or Democrats or foreign insurance companies are going to be able to keep this
[01:08:46.520 --> 01:09:02.520]  monstrosity going no matter how lucrative it is for them as a fraud the fact that it is a criminal fraud and the arrogance of Gruber and others admitting it I believe will bring it down if we continue to force the point here's that report then our guest Mr. Dent
[01:09:02.520 --> 01:09:24.520]  the best use of technologies Jonathan Gruber is one of the most respected economists in the world said in today's Washington Post here's quote here's a bill that reduces the deficit covers 30 million people 30 million more people and has a promise of lowering premiums pretty good
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:45.520]  state we're not finished getting all of our reports back from CBO but we'll have a side by side to compare that's Pelosi but our bill brings down rates I don't know if you have seen Jonathan Gruber of MIT the analysis of the what the comparison is to the status quo versus what will happen in our bill
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:10:06.520]  I don't know who he is he didn't help write our bill I don't know if you have seen Jonathan Gruber of MIT the analysis I don't know who he is he didn't help write our bill and so with all due respect to your question you have a person who wasn't writing our bill commenting on what was going on when we were writing the bill
[01:10:06.520 --> 01:10:26.520]  did you mislead Americans about the taxes about keeping your plan in order to get the bill passed no I did not I just heard about this I get well briefed before I come out here the fact that some advisor who never worked on our staff
[01:10:26.520 --> 01:10:43.520]  the room was think about well how could talk about well how could we make this work and Obama's like well you know I mean he's really realistic I was like look I can't just do this he said it's just I'm an advisor who never worked on our staff expressed an opinion that I completely disagree with
[01:10:43.520 --> 01:11:07.520]  I'm going to see him is summer 2009 the the big issue there is that he really wants to make sure moving forward on cost control I think it'll it's fair to say that there was not a a provision in the health care law that was not extensively debated and was fully transparent lack of
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:23.520]  parents is a huge political advantage and basically you know call to stupidity American voter or whatever but basically that was really really critical to get into the past and to me the most important piece and in some sense the piece I guess I'm most disappointed that Doug and I disagree on is the Cadillac tax
[01:11:23.520 --> 01:11:39.520]  okay economists have called for 40 years to get rid of the regressive inefficient and expensive tax subsidy employer provided health insurance no economists and turn Doug Grease was no economist would ever set up a health system with a tax subsidy employer provided health insurance the terrible policy
[01:11:39.520 --> 01:11:54.520]  turns out politically it's really hard to get rid of and the only way we could take it on was first by mislabeling it calling a tax on insurance plans rather than tax on people and we all know it's really a tax on people who hold those insurance plans and the second was to start at late started in 2018
[01:11:54.520 --> 01:12:05.520]  this is one guy I don't know who this guy was all I know is that it's important for people to have health insurance and if you guys are saying people shouldn't have health insurance I don't know where you're coming from you are you that cruel it is what you're
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:16.520]  the fact is I think it's actually Republicans who haven't been particularly transparent or even honest about the true impact of those well it is Republicans who have been less than forthright and transparent
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:37.520]  you lie and one more misunderstanding I want to clear up under our plan no federal dollars will be used to fund abortions and federal conscience laws will remain in place but it does fund it
[01:12:37.520 --> 01:12:48.520]  now the Congress has said you lie you can defuse it right you can you look at all this crap there's like a million wires in here I want to get a three wire guy
[01:12:48.520 --> 01:12:56.520]  Macroober
[01:12:56.520 --> 01:13:12.520]  it is a giant cancer that's meant to tie into every part of our economy federalized health care death panels huge taxes to foreign corporations huge slice the federal government a total nightmare and we're joined by Mr. Dent for the balance of the hour bestselling
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:41.520]  and of course he's been a CEO of major companies as well and he joins us we appreciate him coming on I want to get more in the demographic cliff because now everywhere not just Donald Trump but I was on CNN's website this morning and they had
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:55.520]  big economists saying that we're going to go over the edge of a cliff and QE's ending and the British government saying that clearly they think some police state will save them from what's coming but the system knows it's going to be catastrophic
[01:13:55.520 --> 01:14:11.520]  why would they throw an Obamacare in that if I was going to design something to stall the economy it'd be Obamacare I mean are they consciously trying to wreck the economy while they consolidate it are they insane because I used to think it was more of a conspiracy
[01:14:11.520 --> 01:14:30.520]  there's obviously corrupt stuff going on and organized crime and government but more than that I really think with their public bragging about ripping us off and acting delusional I'm now prescribing more and more to the fact that like Nero or Hitler or anybody else that the political class is going insane right now
[01:14:30.520 --> 01:14:46.520]  Mr Dent what do you think is happening because I want your take on Obamacare and top strategists that were involved in it admitting it's a giant screw job why would they then brag about screwing us I mean what's wrong with these people
[01:14:46.520 --> 01:15:01.520]  well yeah first of all we're in La La Land when it comes to entitlements where there is no way we can pay what's been promised in health care and social security pension plans are already realizing this the typical person because I studied demographics
[01:15:01.520 --> 01:15:17.520]  retires at age 63 not 65 and then they will live another 22 years you cannot live with full health care benefits and social security governments cannot afford to fund that with the largest generation in history moving into these age ranges
[01:15:17.520 --> 01:15:36.520]  so so right now we're just beginning to feel the sting and the cost of health care and this is only going to make it more costly the truth is Alex the biggest thing that needs to happen something that will only be forced in a crisis we need to be retiring age 75 not 63 to 65
[01:15:36.520 --> 01:15:53.520]  since how much our life expectancy 30s and 40s we're not adjusting for this and it's crazy to think we can support people can work for 40 some years and then be supported for 20 some years by the government it's just endless deficits we're going to see endless deficits even in good times
[01:15:53.520 --> 01:16:08.520]  and of course my demographics have been predicting difficult times the only indicator that predicted the crash in Japan in the early 90s when everybody thought Japan was going to take over the world it is pointing down for China it is pointing severely down for Germany
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:25.520]  and the US although we peaked back in 2007 with the spinning of our baby boom generation we're going to see a bigger demographic drop which comes after age 53 and that is this year peak for the baby boomer so all the trends I have point down and what
[01:16:25.520 --> 01:16:38.520]  governments do the worst thing they're doing Alex is they're pumping up the economy with steroids I call it the markets on crack they're just pumping money into the economy to keep it going and not allowing massive debt to rebalance and restructure
[01:16:38.520 --> 01:16:52.520]  well let me ask you this question we've talked about these basic market facts at the bottom they are we'll go through some of your new graphs and some of your old graphs for folks but how do you expect as an analyst a guy that has a really good brain has made a lot of accurate predictions where do you expect the
[01:16:52.520 --> 01:17:06.520]  dominoes we're not holding you to this but where would you in a prime projection if you had to say if you had to plan your next 10 years now or tell folks what you thought was going to happen where do the dominoes start to fall first is it China is it in Russia is it the
[01:17:06.520 --> 01:17:23.520]  mayor the least and what do you expect to do with not just the welfare crowd but so many yuppies in people think they're going to live large forever on propped up government derivatives and things there's a lot of irrational exuberance out there
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:31.520]  what happens when the music stops and we're playing musical chairs and passing this hang grenade around how bad's it going to be
[01:17:31.520 --> 01:17:44.520]  well you know first of all the biggest thing to understand beyond demographics and debt trends going against us is that we're in a bubble we were in a bubble from late 94 to early 2000 people thought it would never end it went up and up and up
[01:17:44.520 --> 01:18:09.520]  and up and up and then when it crashed it crashed rapidly bubbles crash twice as fast as they build it tends to take five to six years to build a stock bubble like late 24 to late 2985 to 8989 and in Japan you know we had late 94 to early 2000 now we've got early 2009 I think this bubble is probably going to peak by March of next year give or take
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:24.520]  and the point is it doesn't correct and some people saying oh we'll get a correction stocks are getting a little too frothy bubbles don't correct they burst when the Nasdaq bubble burst in two and a half months the first crash took it down 40%
[01:18:24.520 --> 01:18:37.520]  half the entire decline came in the first two and a half months so I tell people the dominoes are going to fall the next you know the market could be peaking here but the signs are that we're going to get a correction here pretty soon and we'll go up
[01:18:37.520 --> 01:18:52.520]  where do I crash hardest places like China yes yes and I think the dominoes of the danger periods for triggering this last time it was the subprime crisis in the US real estate was falling as we predicted back in late 2005 the real estate
[01:18:52.520 --> 01:19:10.520]  peak the bubble was going to burst it started bursting and it triggered all these bad loans from very very bad lending that was the trigger but the whole world went down because of debt and demographics the triggers this time I think obviously politically Putin and Ukraine is the biggest thing you know the Middle
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:29.520]  East has been in problems forever and will be for next several years by our indicators but I think that's the biggest danger Putin moving into Ukraine and continuing aggression on the political side and on on the on demographic side Germany looks worse than Japan did to me in 1989 when we called their crash ahead of time
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:45.520]  they have the Germans aren't having kids flying I mean the Germans aren't having kids they're done they are done and they're Democrat they're going to keep they already disappointed all this year we forecast that last year Germany's going to disappoint and it's going to really turn down in
[01:19:45.520 --> 01:20:00.520]  2015 you did say that last year let's come back and look at that and talk more about Russia because he just threw out a diplomats calling him spies this is escalating quick regardless of which side of this year on this is serious we'll be right back on Alex Jones

[01:23:06.520 --> 01:23:14.520]  several years ago Matt was sitting in his two bedroom apartment frustrated with the direction this country was headed and the charlington's willing to sell us out for a quick buck

[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:34.520]  bestselling author, researcher, economic forecaster, joins us harriedent.com
[01:24:34.520 --> 01:24:50.520]  I know we've got some Obama supporters that called in earlier and I wanted to hear from them we can get your comments coming up and we'll take a few other calls on economic questions for Mr. Dent maybe you disagree with me maybe you agree 800-259-9231
[01:24:50.520 --> 01:24:56.520]  800-259-9231 on this live Tuesday edition
[01:24:56.520 --> 01:25:06.520]  again I'm your host Alex Jones this is out of the one and guardian Putin says west is provoking Russia into a new cold war as spies deported
[01:25:06.520 --> 01:25:17.520]  Russian president denies fanning tensions says NATO expansion Europe has been geopolitical game changer they've now got fighter bombers and bombers flying around the Gulf of Mexico that are nuclear able
[01:25:17.520 --> 01:25:33.520]  Vladimir Putin has suggested to German interviewer that the west is provoking Russia into a new cold war and he's also kicking out different NATO and other ambassadors saying they're basically spies well I mean all these people are spies
[01:25:33.520 --> 01:25:43.520]  here's my deal I don't say Putin's a great guy my problem is Russia has not been expanding itself or lowering oil prices to try to bankrupt them
[01:25:43.520 --> 01:25:55.520]  the west is they are destabilizing Ukraine I would expect Russia to come in and try to get control of his resources in eastern Ukraine that said though the west is just going forward
[01:25:55.520 --> 01:26:09.520]  Mr. Dent what's your view on this from an atheistic view I don't mean that obviously religiously but as a political you know atheistic view what is it what do you expect Russia to do and why do you call it the biggest trigger right now
[01:26:09.520 --> 01:26:23.520]  well you know it's just naturally in Putin's interest the demographics of Russia are very poor in years ahead they've been growing very slowly all of the communist countries there was just an off head by David Brooks in New York Times recently
[01:26:23.520 --> 01:26:40.520]  like this as you look at the communist countries like 90% of them are basically failed only 10% of them are working in Catholics and a lot of those just because they have resources Putin's got every incentive to expand by acquiring places like Ukraine and Georgia back into the old Soviet Union
[01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:58.520]  that's a strong goal of his he makes no bones about it he doesn't care if people don't like him he's in control of his country he's popular there I think he's going to find every way to keep pushing it's just a matter of when he finds the hole you know like a good runner in football and just breaks through the line
[01:26:58.520 --> 01:27:15.520]  and so when he does that that's going to be very destabilizing for the world it's the next World War three if we're going to have one it's not going to be anything like World War two the Middle East is more like civil wars within this is something that could be a major conflict when it happens
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:37.520]  we also Alex have a geopolitical cycle it was positive from 83 to 2000 nothing went wrong in the world from 2000 from 9-11 2001 9-11 Ford everything's gone wrong this cycle continues to point down I've tracked it over 200 years into 2019 so we're also telling people the geopolitical arena in the world is not going to get better
[01:27:37.520 --> 01:27:52.520]  it's only going to get worse in the Middle East and Russia Africa you know whatever you know maybe Ebola turns into something I don't know but but the stock market is going straight up as if we're in not in a risky world this is the riskiest time by all of our indicators
[01:27:52.520 --> 01:28:07.520]  since the 1930s and the markets are acting like it's a cakewalk why because the Federal Reserve is guaranteeing the market you know they're just pushing money in and the markets go down they push more money in and the markets think hey the feds got our back so they're just going to go up until something
[01:28:07.520 --> 01:28:14.520]  goes wrong and then you're going to see a bubble crash way worse than we saw in 2008-09.
[01:28:14.520 --> 01:28:34.520]  Let's talk about what the different political elites are doing we're about to go to break long segments coming up clearly in the universities clearly in leftist politics Bill and Melinda Gates you name it they don't want Germany and England and the United States and places like that to have children
[01:28:34.520 --> 01:28:51.520]  clearly there's a move to tell you you shouldn't have you know more than one kid but then they want to import third world populations from unskilled areas why would the political elites want to undermine the future of the west
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:29:07.520]  we know I don't know but it's something we've seen throughout history when people get more fluent when they move from rural to urban areas they have less kids because it costs so much to raise a kid in urban areas and now with the education bubble which is the greatest bubble I've ever seen
[01:29:07.520 --> 01:29:22.520]  and something has to be done about it you have to be rich just to get into college or you have to get huge student loans so this is a thing that goes with urbanization it's happening around the world people choose to have less kids and governments and institutions
[01:29:22.520 --> 01:29:42.520]  you have to have at least two kids a family to just sustain your country and nobody doubts that demographic fact I agree then why are the eugenicists the leftist jumping on having less kids and saying it's bad to even have one or two why do they have such an anti-civilization view
[01:29:42.520 --> 01:29:48.520]  I want to see if you agree with that or disagree straight ahead stay with us folks your phone calls are coming up as well
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:55.520]  we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[01:30:28.520 --> 01:30:35.520]  not our iodine it comes from over 200 million year old crystal salt deposits and is tested and proven to be completely pure

[01:33:17.520 --> 01:33:31.520]  what I'm getting at is this
[01:33:31.520 --> 01:33:47.520]  tax credits for parents I've got three children we've had people countless times in Austin and Whole Foods going to say you shouldn't have three kids it's pushed everywhere I can play the clips on Fox News too many kids making the planet worse
[01:33:47.520 --> 01:34:05.520]  well yeah they're having five six kids in the third world we're having 1.5 kids here society collapses we don't have 2.1 children we've had top demographers on the broadcast we've gone over the numbers that dent is breaking down here
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:17.520]  so why is there an attempt with carbon taxes to shut down the west why is there an attempt to do this when we need to produce more real wealth just to keep from collapsing
[01:34:17.520 --> 01:34:39.520]  and then they want us to sign on to more unsustainable that is because insider mega banks want a debtor society they can control we'll get dent's taken see me disagrees here in a moment start taking some of your phone calls before we go any further though here's some of the headlines New York Times Obama administration and health insurers have powerful mutually beneficial partnership New York Times
[01:34:39.520 --> 01:34:59.520]  Val companies will strenuously fight Republican efforts to dismantle Obamacare and more taxes are now emerging meanwhile 3000 illegals joined Texas schools this week 95% of families of illegals being released new wave expected
[01:34:59.520 --> 01:35:14.520]  I mean this country is being imploded right now ladies and gentlemen ex Obama aid demolishes New York Times claim that Gruber role wasn't limited
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:30.520]  and former Obama aid says that he was the guru of the health plan we'll cover that article coming up and the video is on info wars dot com with the guest Steve Ratner we're going to play that clip coming up once we get its top story
[01:35:30.520 --> 01:35:46.520]  on a dot com info wars dot com Harry Dent dot com is our guest website before I go any further give the gift this Christmas I'll be politically incorrect or this holiday of getting people healthy we've come out with revolutionary hardcore missing link hiding in

[01:36:17.520 --> 01:36:23.920]  was the best B12 out there. It just does amazing things. Unfortunately, we even got more delivered
[01:36:23.920 --> 01:36:29.360]  than we had previously produced. They had an overage at the laboratory, but it will be sold out
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:33.760]  within a couple days. So if you want to get secret 12, it'll probably be till Christmas,
[01:36:33.760 --> 01:36:39.440]  till we get more. I can't wait to hear your reviews of it. It's been amazing for me and my family.
[01:36:39.440 --> 01:36:45.920]  Secret 12, what we believe is the most powerful, purest, highly absorbable form of B12 out there.
[01:36:45.920 --> 01:36:50.800]  80% of it, of what's in there is what the injectable is, but you don't inject this. It's taken
[01:36:50.800 --> 01:36:55.200]  sublingually or lingually under the tongue or on the tongue. It's more of put it under the tongue
[01:36:55.200 --> 01:37:01.040]  and let it really soak into those glands, the saliva glands there, but very, very powerful.

[01:37:56.320 --> 01:38:02.720]  all over the place. And that's another question for Dent on Trends. If a guy from Texas in 20 years,
[01:38:03.680 --> 01:38:08.880]  from nowhere, never took alone, nothing can build this organization that reaches about 18
[01:38:08.880 --> 01:38:13.840]  million people a week, one way or another, with podcasts, YouTube, terrestrial radio, satellite,
[01:38:13.840 --> 01:38:18.160]  what's the establishment media going to do? Well, CNN's getting dropped off dish. CNN's
[01:38:18.160 --> 01:38:22.880]  getting dropped off cable systems. But not just because they're too big, too top heavy,
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:29.040]  too dinosaur-like. It's also, they told us Obamacare was good. So Dent, I want to get with
[01:38:29.040 --> 01:38:35.120]  you today into the Dow mini megaphone pattern chart, show that to folks, other key news.
[01:38:35.120 --> 01:38:40.960]  But what do you expect on that subject I raised? Or do you disagree that there is a
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:49.040]  anti-growth, anti-freedom, anti-family move in the West that is counterproductive,
[01:38:49.040 --> 01:38:54.320]  even to the political class? Do you disagree with that A or B? Why do you think that is?
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:58.800]  Well, I think governments just aren't taking account of some fundamental changes that have
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:04.240]  already occurred. Women have entered the workforce at rapid rates since the 1950s.
[01:39:04.240 --> 01:39:09.520]  When women enter the workforce, it starts to become a dilemma between work, their career,
[01:39:09.520 --> 01:39:14.800]  and having kids. The countries that help women the most and have the strongest maternity policies,
[01:39:14.800 --> 01:39:19.280]  countries like Norway and Sweden, have some of the highest birth rates in the West.
[01:39:19.280 --> 01:39:24.720]  Countries like Australia, Canada, and New Zealand in the U.S. encourage high immigration or
[01:39:24.720 --> 01:39:28.880]  attract high immigration one way or the other. And the immigrants tend to have more kids.
[01:39:28.880 --> 01:39:35.520]  But governments need to realize that as people get affluent, as they move more into urban areas,
[01:39:35.520 --> 01:39:41.600]  as women move more in the workforce, you have to encourage and make it easier for women to still
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:46.560]  have kids. They have to be able to work and have kids. You can't make those work against each other.
[01:39:46.560 --> 01:39:50.640]  And there's countries that are doing this. And there's countries that don't have huge deficits
[01:39:50.640 --> 01:39:56.560]  like Australia. There's countries like Australia that attract high-quality immigration on purpose.
[01:39:56.560 --> 01:40:02.320]  There's ways to do this right. It's just most governments are asleep on this. And like you say,
[01:40:02.320 --> 01:40:09.680]  there's too much encouragement, entrepreneurialism. We need to encourage all this stuff. More kids,
[01:40:09.680 --> 01:40:14.960]  more entrepreneurial activity, less bureaucracy, less top-down planning. And the most top-down
[01:40:14.960 --> 01:40:20.720]  planned economy in the entire world today, so planning the USSR, is China. And China is going
[01:40:20.720 --> 01:40:24.960]  to have the biggest bubble of all because their government created a bigger bubble than our government.
[01:40:24.960 --> 01:40:30.240]  Well, they admit that. So what do you expect is going to happen? How do you see China going down?
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:35.200]  And then I want to get into the Dow mini-megaphone pattern. It's so important. And look at the
[01:40:35.200 --> 01:40:40.400]  Dow at 6,000. You've got all these charts at HarryDent.com. But history doesn't lie. Patterns
[01:40:40.400 --> 01:40:45.680]  don't lie. They're clearly there. How do you expect China to go? Well, here's what you have to
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:49.600]  understand what China has done for it. People are saying, oh, this, the communist model actually
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:54.880]  works when you make it more capitalistic like China. No, economists are clueless on this.
[01:40:55.840 --> 01:41:02.720]  China has simply overbuilt everything, 20, 30, 40, 50%, infrastructures, real estate,
[01:41:02.720 --> 01:41:07.760]  and housing, industrial capacity. China has moved people from rural to urban areas.
[01:41:07.760 --> 01:41:13.760]  That is a natural thing, but not at the rate. China's economy is on steroids. They have overbuilt.
[01:41:13.760 --> 01:41:20.320]  I've calculated they pretty much overbuilt their economy for 15 years out and created the greatest
[01:41:20.320 --> 01:41:27.680]  bubble in real estate in modern history. When this thing crashes, there's going to be 220 million
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:32.480]  people with no skills, moved in from rural areas who've been just building stuff for nobody.
[01:41:32.480 --> 01:41:36.960]  When that bubble stops, they're going to have no work. They're not even legal citizens in these
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:41.520]  cities, only back in the rural areas. And they've already paved those over. This is going to be
[01:41:41.520 --> 01:41:45.680]  the biggest disaster in modern history. And Alex, what I think it's going to prove
[01:41:45.680 --> 01:41:50.560]  wrong on these economists who are praising the China model as the new state-driven capitalism,
[01:41:50.560 --> 01:41:55.840]  it's going to prove that governments can't top down, manage an economy. It's the free market
[01:41:55.840 --> 01:42:00.960]  democratic system that has become so wealthy. And China is violating that, and they're going
[01:42:00.960 --> 01:42:06.640]  to prove this model, their new model wrong. Well, that's right. History is totally clear on that.
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:12.000]  And I love how they call it state-run capitalism. They have another name for it. It's called fascism.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:18.320]  Yeah. I mean, it is. I mean, it is top down. It's crony capitalism. In the Communist Party,
[01:42:18.320 --> 01:42:22.560]  it's just like the mafia or something. Whoever knows the politicians gets favored by them.
[01:42:22.560 --> 01:42:27.280]  They get the deals. The politicians encourage all this overbuilding. And then they encourage the
[01:42:27.280 --> 01:42:33.520]  developers not to cut prices. And then the developers encourage clueless, affluent Chinese to
[01:42:33.520 --> 01:42:38.400]  buy condos that are empty. They don't even try to rent them out. They just buy them in the government
[01:42:38.400 --> 01:42:42.960]  and developers try to guarantee they'll go up. Well, developers are cutting prices. That's the
[01:42:42.960 --> 01:42:46.800]  first sign. They are cutting prices up to 40%. Well, I was about to say, how do you build,
[01:42:47.680 --> 01:42:55.120]  you know, tens of millions of units? I mean, just whole cities of empty 50-story, 60-story condos,
[01:42:55.120 --> 01:43:01.360]  and there's not even grocery stores for 15 miles away and no roads. It is insane asylum level.
[01:43:01.360 --> 01:43:07.280]  It is. This is so obvious, Alex. But economists don't see it. Well, China's growing at eight,
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:11.680]  12% a year. I tell people, look at China's stock market where they don't measure growth,
[01:43:11.680 --> 01:43:16.480]  they measure profits. That's what stocks do. When you overbuild, you have high fixed costs,
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:23.280]  high debt loads, and you're unprofitable. China's stock market crashed 70% more than ours in 2008,
[01:43:23.280 --> 01:43:28.560]  had a feeble rally in the early 2010, and has been going down ever since as a near its lows.
[01:43:28.560 --> 01:43:34.880]  The stock market is saying, our economy stinks, and it does. Now, when real estate and all the
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:40.160]  speculation in real estate collapses, the affluent are going to lose wealth at a rate that nobody's
[01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:44.560]  seen, and the affluent people, the top 10% of people in China who are buying all this real estate,
[01:43:44.560 --> 01:43:51.200]  they control 60% of the wealth and high amounts of income. When the affluent go down,
[01:43:52.000 --> 01:43:55.920]  China's going to go down, and this is going to be one of the biggest surprises of the next several
[01:43:55.920 --> 01:44:01.680]  years. What about the Dow mini megaphone pattern? We're going to put that on screen for TV viewers,
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:05.920]  but describe it for radio listeners. Yeah, put that up, because we talked the last few times,
[01:44:05.920 --> 01:44:10.480]  we've talked, I talked about a bigger megaphone pattern where each bubble goes higher, but each
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:16.960]  crash goes lower. Well, the same pattern's happening here near term. Since June, each high in the
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:22.080]  market's gone a little higher, but each low is gone radically lower. So we're at a critical
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:27.680]  point here in the markets. We had this correction, this sharp correction in October 15th, but then
[01:44:27.680 --> 01:44:32.800]  a surprisingly even sharper move back up, I call these the markets on crack. When you have this
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:38.320]  much stimulus and highly leveraged speculation by traders and stuff, the market just crazy,
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:43.280]  just goes up, up, up, up, and then it makes these violent moves, it kills the everyday investor.
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:48.000]  The market's at a critical point. With the top part of this little mini megaphone pattern,
[01:44:48.000 --> 01:44:52.480]  just a little above it, which is typical at the end, we're either going to go back down
[01:44:52.480 --> 01:44:58.960]  to the lower side, which would be about 15,500 on the Dow, or if we don't make a new low in the
[01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:04.000]  next month, I'm saying by mid-December, this is my decision point, we don't see a new low in the
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:10.080]  Dow, like 15,500 or so by early to mid-December, then this market's probably going to go push up
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:15.760]  one more time, and our target would be around 19,000 on the Dow, and that's because the final
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:22.240]  resistance would be the old high on the NASDAQ back in 2000, it did 5,050, and that's about
[01:45:22.240 --> 01:45:27.120]  7 to 8% higher. So stocks are either going to go 7 to 8% higher in the next couple of months,
[01:45:27.120 --> 01:45:30.720]  but if they break down about 12%, then this bubble is over.
[01:45:31.280 --> 01:45:35.600]  And then that's what our entire fiat economy's based on. I hear some people call and talk radio,
[01:45:35.600 --> 01:45:40.560]  I talk to folks on the street, they say, I don't care if Obama's bankrupting coal power plants,
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:44.240]  I don't care if the stock market goes down, I don't own stock. They don't know they get
[01:45:44.240 --> 01:45:48.880]  electricity from those plants, they don't know companies are running and expanding and hiring
[01:45:48.880 --> 01:45:54.400]  people off their stock price. What's going to happen to kind of the trust fund kids,
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:59.680]  the yuppies, the trendies, also blue collar workers that don't care about these,
[01:45:59.680 --> 01:46:04.880]  I mean, what's going to happen when this comes crashing down? I expect people to just go crazy.
[01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:12.720]  Well, you know, Homer Simpson already got hit that the housing crisis, the average household
[01:46:12.720 --> 01:46:18.400]  peaks at age 46, we hit that in 2007. We predicted that 20 years before, that by 2007,
[01:46:18.400 --> 01:46:22.640]  our economic momentum after that would turn down. It did. Governments are just
[01:46:23.280 --> 01:46:28.560]  filling that up with free money, which is crazy. But Homer Simpson's already been hit hard.
[01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:34.800]  Underwater mortgages, wages have been declining, adjusted for inflation since 2000 for a long time.
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:42.960]  It's the top 20%, the college educated, low unemployment people. And then these 20% own all
[01:46:42.960 --> 01:46:47.840]  the financial assets like stock. Most people own a home, but most people don't own that much stock.
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:52.800]  And this stock market crashes, it's going to hit the affluent. And it's going to hit them much harder
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:57.440]  than it hit Homer Simpson, because they're so invested in this bubble and in real estate and
[01:46:57.440 --> 01:47:01.600]  stocks. And they're very haughty and very arrogant. You know, they make fun of the old
[01:47:01.600 --> 01:47:05.680]  timers that would put their money in their mattress or bury gold in the back 40. Well,
[01:47:05.680 --> 01:47:10.080]  you know what? Those old folks ended up being in a good place once the depression hit and
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:14.240]  actually got richer. But it's the trendies that end up jumping out of buildings.
[01:47:15.040 --> 01:47:20.240]  Yes, exactly. And the government has rigged the markets by putting interest rates at zero
[01:47:20.240 --> 01:47:25.040]  short-term and zero adjusted for inflation long-term. They're saying money is free.
[01:47:25.040 --> 01:47:30.240]  That means people, they're not going to buy bonds, so they forces them into the stock market.
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:36.640]  It allows traders and hedge funds in financial institutions to lever 30 to 51 at low cost,
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:40.240]  and that just creates, that just feeds this bubble. And then they make money just off of the
[01:47:40.240 --> 01:47:43.120]  trades. The government is freeing the bubble that has to burst. It's not inflation we should
[01:47:43.120 --> 01:47:48.160]  worry about or hyperinflation. It's this bubble bursting because the government has deliberately
[01:47:48.160 --> 01:47:52.640]  created another bubble to keep the wealthy spending because they're the only people
[01:47:52.640 --> 01:47:57.120]  that will spend and wealthy people peak later around early fifties, which is about now. Now,
[01:47:57.120 --> 01:48:02.240]  so we see the wealthy going off a cliff naturally and we see this bubble bursting
[01:48:02.240 --> 01:48:06.240]  hitting them because they own all these way over value financial assets.
[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:12.880]  That's right. Absolutely right. This is a fact. Just, just trap yourselves in. Mercedes and Dan
[01:48:12.880 --> 01:48:17.600]  for the guest, then we'll go to Matt and Chuck and Jay after he leaves us all these Obama supporters.
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:21.680]  We've got our reporters in Ferguson to give us a report at the bottom of the next hour.
[01:48:22.240 --> 01:48:25.440]  Let's go to Mercedes in Oregon. You got a question for Mr. Dent. Go ahead.
[01:48:25.440 --> 01:48:36.320]  Yes, I was listening and I take real issue with any statements claiming that people have to work
[01:48:36.320 --> 01:48:46.640]  until they're 75. That to me is, is it is an insane statement because, and I'll tell you
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:58.800]  you the minute that Alex Jones started speaking out and standing up for all of us, for himself
[01:48:58.800 --> 01:49:07.840]  and for all of us, his family, this was on its way out. Okay. People got to understand that we are
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:15.840]  awaking. We're making changes. We're doing it on a conscious and unconscious level now.
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:24.160]  All this horrible stuff that you guys are seeing is because it's on its way out. Okay.
[01:49:24.160 --> 01:49:27.360]  Well, man, let me just stop it for a minute. Let me just stop because I want to quantify what
[01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:34.080]  you're saying. Listen, he's saying with the amount of entitlements, with what's been done,
[01:49:34.080 --> 01:49:38.800]  with all the free stuff given away to big corporations, but also poor people, it's created
[01:49:38.800 --> 01:49:45.520]  debt bubbles that even if you work till 75, you're not going to be able to basically retire.
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:51.200]  We've created an impossible fraud living on future generations. So he doesn't want you to work till
[01:49:51.200 --> 01:50:00.720]  you're 75. He's saying that that's a mathematical fact of what has been developed. And sorry,
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:07.760]  you didn't have three kids. So there isn't a big enough economy now for you to be able to do that.
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:12.480]  I mean, this is just how it works. But I'm going to skip this network break. This is so important.
[01:50:12.480 --> 01:50:17.360]  I want to give her a time. Quantify for me. Talk to me like I'm five years old, Mercedes.
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:22.400]  What are you saying here? You're saying we're going to beat this system. We're going to change it.
[01:50:22.400 --> 01:50:28.720]  We're going to whatever. I mean, explain to me because their answer is bring in austerity. And
[01:50:28.720 --> 01:50:33.440]  so you'll be willing to live with less. That's the bureaucrats answer and then punish everybody
[01:50:33.440 --> 01:50:39.520]  like with Obamacare for the overspending, which is worse than fascism. I don't even know what you
[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:46.080]  call this. What are you quantifying here? I mean, what are you trying to say? Okay, so look, you've
[01:50:46.080 --> 01:50:52.240]  already pointed out the fraud. It's a fraud. Okay, so patterns, projections, all this stuff
[01:50:52.240 --> 01:51:00.240]  based on fraud. Therefore, we replace the fraud with a real economy. And this is where other
[01:51:00.240 --> 01:51:07.680]  people come into play. Like Karen, who does she's been talking about restoring the economy on its
[01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:16.240]  basic level. What is the money based on? She's saying gold and it's there. We can make this change
[01:51:16.240 --> 01:51:23.760]  without having to go into war because that is what everybody wants. I mean, it's, it's so fraudulent.
[01:51:23.760 --> 01:51:28.640]  It's so big. Don't you understand? No, no, no. Listen, I appreciate your call. I want to get Mr.
[01:51:28.640 --> 01:51:34.000]  Dent's take on this, but listen, they've made the decision that old people are crud and that babies
[01:51:34.000 --> 01:51:37.280]  are crud youth and eyes everybody. That's going to be the real solution that Bill Gates is getting
[01:51:37.280 --> 01:51:41.840]  us ready for in the left. Get everybody ready for it. Okay, we have to start valuing our parents
[01:51:41.840 --> 01:51:47.600]  again. We have to start valuing being savers again. We have to start valuing our heroes,
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:52.160]  being trailblazers and inventors again. I don't want to blame the general public, but on average,
[01:51:52.160 --> 01:51:57.200]  we've gotten pretty decadent and soft. Okay. Now, now, Dent can disagree. I want to get his take on
[01:51:57.200 --> 01:52:02.160]  this. He's just talking about what they're already getting everybody ready for. Is there a way out
[01:52:02.160 --> 01:52:06.320]  of this or a way to mitigate it and not make it as rough as it's going to be? Because I can tell
[01:52:06.320 --> 01:52:12.880]  this is scaring people. What do you take from what she said? Well, you know, Mercedes, I hear
[01:52:12.880 --> 01:52:20.000]  what you're saying. It's just here, here's the number, $67 trillion in unfunded Medicare, Medicaid
[01:52:20.000 --> 01:52:25.040]  and social security entitlement promise to people at a time when the economy is going to slow down
[01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:29.680]  naturally because the baby boom has peaked and spending. So this is numbers only going to get
[01:52:29.680 --> 01:52:36.000]  worth $67 trillion. That is four times as much as our total government, federal government debt
[01:52:36.000 --> 01:52:41.760]  that has people skated that. That's real. If you can figure a way we can retire at 63 to 65
[01:52:41.760 --> 01:52:48.160]  and not fund that $67 trillion and growing, then great. My second thing is everybody I know that's
[01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:53.120]  retired and most people are bored. I have no intentions to retire until my health fail. I'm
[01:52:53.120 --> 01:52:58.640]  going to work till 75, 80, whatever. I want to do something. I want to maybe work less. I maybe want
[01:52:58.640 --> 01:53:04.320]  to do something that's more fun to me or more challenging or something I value more.
[01:53:04.320 --> 01:53:09.040]  Now, you might want to go teach economics. You might want to go oil paint. You might want to,
[01:53:09.040 --> 01:53:12.960]  you know, run a gardening school. You might want to take more vacations, but, you know.
[01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:17.760]  Start your own charitable foundation. There's many things to do, but this is the reality
[01:53:17.760 --> 01:53:24.560]  that America and all countries around the world are not facing. And you see Japan's debt just
[01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:30.160]  keeps going up and up and up and up and up because they're 11 years ahead of us. Japan has had their
[01:53:30.160 --> 01:53:35.520]  bubble burst ahead of us, real estate stocks. They've had this coma economy with stimulus
[01:53:35.520 --> 01:53:39.680]  that never turns around because they don't rebalance the debt and don't let the bubble
[01:53:39.680 --> 01:53:43.920]  burst and let things, because see, one of the problems is people old or young are facing
[01:53:43.920 --> 01:53:48.800]  unaffordable education, unaffordable healthcare. People investing for the future are going to
[01:53:48.800 --> 01:53:53.600]  get no returns because stocks and real estate have bubbled up so much. If we don't correct
[01:53:53.600 --> 01:53:58.400]  these imbalances, which the free market system does very, very well on its own, then we're not
[01:53:58.400 --> 01:54:01.600]  going to have them. I mean, look, there's a destructiveness to it. And I go back to the
[01:54:01.600 --> 01:54:05.280]  Democrats and I've never been a partisan person, but they've really turned into a virulent form
[01:54:05.280 --> 01:54:09.760]  of cancer right now. I'm just, I'm just stating the facts here. They're not like Australia or
[01:54:09.760 --> 01:54:15.840]  Switzerland saying, bring us your skilled workers, bring us your brains. They want now welfare moms,
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:22.640]  unaccompanied kids, people with mental illness, people with handicaps to bankrupt the system.
[01:54:22.640 --> 01:54:28.320]  And they admit they want to bankrupt it to, like Ezekiel Emanuel said, we want to wreck everything
[01:54:28.320 --> 01:54:34.880]  to take it over. There is a piratical nature here where they want to ride these crises to
[01:54:34.880 --> 01:54:43.200]  dictatorial power. Your take on that statement. Well, you know, I'll just back up and say,
[01:54:43.200 --> 01:54:48.000]  look, we have to face this problem. It takes a transition. Germany's already raised their
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:52.400]  retirement age from 65 to 67. And they're old, isn't it? No, I know, but they're not even
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:57.760]  trying to replace people with hard workers now. Why would the Democrats want the worst immigrants
[01:54:57.760 --> 01:55:04.640]  out there? Right, exactly. We let the least educated come across the border freely. And
[01:55:04.640 --> 01:55:09.840]  then we turned down people with master's degrees that come over here from China and India. So,
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:16.880]  again, it's the opposite of what Australia does. Australia has actually had, the next generation
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:22.240]  is larger than the baby boom generation in Australia, Norway, and Sweden, and a handful
[01:55:22.240 --> 01:55:27.920]  of smaller countries because they've encouraged births and or they've encouraged high quality
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:31.840]  immigration. We have to do that. We're doing the opposite. We have to stop committing suicide
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:36.880]  politically and economically. Let's go to Dan in Canada has a question for Mr. Dent. Go ahead.
[01:55:38.400 --> 01:55:44.800]  Hello. Yep. You're on the air. All right. How are you doing? First time caller. Welcome.
[01:55:44.800 --> 01:55:52.000]  Basie, I have a question. I was listening to some other economic people talking and
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:56.960]  the people that don't have money, let's say to buy gold or silver or whatever,
[01:55:56.960 --> 01:56:01.120]  like the people that are working hard, just trying to get by day to day, pay their bills
[01:56:01.120 --> 01:56:06.480]  and raise their kids or families as best they can. They were saying to go into something like,
[01:56:06.480 --> 01:56:11.520]  for example, like, say, buy bottles of alcohol or cards of cigarettes and just stockpile them
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:16.560]  because they could be used as bartering tools later on. Yeah. Yeah. I've always told people
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:21.920]  like bourbon bottles and shotgun shells, things that you know people will want or can goods or
[01:56:21.920 --> 01:56:26.800]  something. Makes sense. Gold and silver keep going down because the reality is we're in a
[01:56:26.800 --> 01:56:31.440]  deflationary environment when you have asset bubbles, when stocks and financial assets bubble
[01:56:31.440 --> 01:56:36.000]  up driven by debt bubbles. Sure. I think he's asking how to be more successful now.
[01:56:36.000 --> 01:56:41.680]  Deflation. Money gets destroyed. Cash is king. And like you say, just basic things that you can
[01:56:41.680 --> 01:56:46.560]  barter with will be much better than gold and silver. I see gold going to 700 or lower and
[01:56:46.560 --> 01:56:53.200]  silver going to five to $10 or lower. And I've been, we got people out of silver at $49 in late
[01:56:53.200 --> 01:56:58.080]  April of 2011, the day of the top. That's still a wild card in my view, but we've got to look at
[01:56:58.080 --> 01:57:03.360]  all options. Expanding on that though, I think he's mainly asking, how can he be more successful?
[01:57:03.360 --> 01:57:08.800]  You've got to see how trends are moving. You might have to move to a boom town and know the
[01:57:08.800 --> 01:57:14.160]  business in the niche where you can charge more and be more successful and then force yourself to
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:20.960]  expand and duplicate your skill. Cause it's almost like you can't stay small now and really gain a
[01:57:20.960 --> 01:57:26.080]  bunch of wealth in most cases. You've got to duplicate that skill you've got in an area that
[01:57:26.080 --> 01:57:30.800]  is a boom area. And so what did our ancestors do before when something was bad? They migrated.
[01:57:30.800 --> 01:57:35.680]  And so, I mean, it's coming to a time where you can't sit where you've always been.
[01:57:35.680 --> 01:57:40.240]  You've got to move around and try things and be entrepreneurial. Mr. Dent.
[01:57:40.800 --> 01:57:44.720]  Yeah. And real quickly, yeah, this is the time to become an entrepreneur because jobs are going
[01:57:44.720 --> 01:57:48.720]  to get slaughtered when this happens. But it's also there's in demographics, there's always
[01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:54.240]  something booming as the baby boomers age. If I were working for a car dealer, I would switch to
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:57:59.600]  an RV dealer. RVs are going to have the greatest boom in history. Healthcare, nursing homes,
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:04.800]  vitamins, companies, things like that. These things are going to boom with the aging of the
[01:58:04.800 --> 01:58:09.920]  baby boomers. So you want to also orient your job or your skills to a sector that still has
[01:58:09.920 --> 01:58:15.200]  good demographic trends. Or like you say, towns where people are moving to, Texas is a great
[01:58:15.200 --> 01:58:21.360]  state. I mean, it's got the strongest migration and immigration of any country and it's created the
[01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:26.160]  most jobs. So if you're in Texas, you didn't have a bubble in real estate like the coast did.
[01:58:26.160 --> 01:58:30.560]  So you're not going to get cream. And you've got better demographics. So yes,

[01:59:52.640 --> 01:59:55.280]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:59:55.280 --> 02:00:13.280]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:22.240]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:22.240 --> 02:00:29.200]  Just to be clear, folks, I'm holding on to all the gold and silver I have. And I believe that
[02:00:30.240 --> 02:00:33.280]  the global is manipulating the economy, where you're going to have
[02:00:33.280 --> 02:00:37.440]  depressionary bubbles imploding, inflationary bubbles imploding into
[02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:43.200]  depressionary type economics. But you'll also see commodities spiked during that as well.
[02:00:43.200 --> 02:00:46.640]  So that's why I've never sold a piece of gold or silver that I've gotten. And most of what I bought
[02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:52.720]  when it was, you know, silver was for six dollars an ounce and gold was 350. I've still bought
[02:00:52.720 --> 02:00:57.120]  throughout. I bought when it was up to 2000. I bought when it was down to 1200. But it could
[02:00:57.120 --> 02:01:03.360]  be the way Dent says. It's just that now there's a lot less resources. And so things that do have
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:08.880]  intrinsic valuable and are portable, I believe we're going to have high value. That's my view
[02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:14.400]  on it. So I believe those that have invested in gold and silver as a hedge against uncertain times
[02:01:14.400 --> 02:01:19.440]  have done well. I believe I've done well. You notice I live in Texas. You notice I'm in nutraceuticals,
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:23.360]  everything he was recommending. I mean, I try to fund our operation to get the word out by
[02:01:23.360 --> 02:01:27.840]  thinking smart so that I can do that. There are not many other people that have ever been able,
[02:01:27.840 --> 02:01:32.320]  from grassroots level, to fund an operation the way I've done it without major corporate backing.
[02:01:33.120 --> 02:01:37.760]  I mean, we weren't created by news core, you know, that I was already worth tens of billions of
[02:01:37.760 --> 02:01:43.440]  dollars like Fox News. This all just came from you supporting us. So I think my economic views
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:48.880]  have some value. And that's my two cents. Matt in Oklahoma says he supports Obama. Thanks for
[02:01:48.880 --> 02:01:54.080]  holding. Matt, go ahead. I mean, do you really support obozo? I mean, Obama?
[02:01:54.960 --> 02:02:00.240]  Well, let me go ahead and start off and say, well, you know, I want to, okay, I did support him.
[02:02:00.240 --> 02:02:03.040]  I voted for him in, you know, even both elections.
[02:02:05.600 --> 02:02:10.880]  Specifically, yes, because, you know, you got to do that these days. But ultimately,
[02:02:10.880 --> 02:02:17.760]  it, my reasoning was, you know, I'd actually lived through the Bush years and was, you know,
[02:02:17.760 --> 02:02:22.640]  one of those people that was kind of pissed off the way that whole thing went. I personally,
[02:02:22.640 --> 02:02:28.480]  due to the way the economy, the industry I was in was devastated when the economy was destroyed
[02:02:28.480 --> 02:02:35.520]  with all of the resources being sent overseas to basically rebuild Iraq, the cost to build
[02:02:35.520 --> 02:02:40.960]  houses. No, no, I get it. So you voted against the Republicans as a referendum on what they did.
[02:02:40.960 --> 02:02:45.920]  And I totally get it. The problem was Obama works for the very same people and was meant to
[02:02:45.920 --> 02:02:51.200]  sell the left on completing that takeover. Remember, Mitt Romney, thanks Jonathan Gruber.
[02:02:52.560 --> 02:02:58.560]  Right, right. And that's actually why I wanted to call in because a lot of times I realize he's
[02:02:58.560 --> 02:03:05.200]  going to be the poster child for, you know, the darts to be thrown. But you've also got to realize
[02:03:05.200 --> 02:03:10.240]  that you probably have a lot of people that are, you know, middle of the road that watch the show.
[02:03:10.240 --> 02:03:14.560]  And if you always toss out ad hominin attacks against the left or the right,
[02:03:14.560 --> 02:03:19.040]  you're kind of playing into the very system that you're lamenting against.
[02:03:20.560 --> 02:03:22.240]  Well, I think that's a fair question.
[02:03:24.720 --> 02:03:30.160]  I didn't support the Republicans under Bush, even though they claim to be more libertarian.
[02:03:30.160 --> 02:03:36.720]  And if the Republicans get in and become a virulent form of cancer, like the Democrats
[02:03:36.720 --> 02:03:41.360]  have become, I mean, the Republicans weren't saying two plus two equals five. And I should
[02:03:41.360 --> 02:03:45.600]  turn all my guns in. If they act like that, I'll go after them. I'm going after Boehner and all
[02:03:45.600 --> 02:03:51.040]  of them for backing Obamacare right now. So I'm trying to go after the Republican leadership
[02:03:51.040 --> 02:03:57.520]  to try to get good libertarians in through the Republican party to try to actually change things.
[02:03:57.520 --> 02:04:06.320]  And so I see the entire establishment lined up against the Tea Party for a good reason.
[02:04:06.320 --> 02:04:11.200]  The Tea Party's got a lot of good people in it, and it's got some good sound economic ideas in it.
[02:04:11.200 --> 02:04:15.600]  Now, are they a little Islamophobic? Yes. Do they like wars? Yes. But that's changing.
[02:04:16.400 --> 02:04:23.040]  The Ron Paul Revolution lives on in the Tea Party that the Republicans tried to take over and failed.
[02:04:23.040 --> 02:04:28.560]  And so all I'm saying is I'm trying to fix this peacefully, because between the Republican and
[02:04:28.560 --> 02:04:33.760]  Democratic leadership, we don't have a prayer in hell. So we've got to try to take the States
[02:04:33.760 --> 02:04:38.320]  back. We've got to try to take over the Republican party. If the Democrats had some insurrection
[02:04:38.320 --> 02:04:42.960]  in them to turn things around, I would support that. What do you say to that? Well, I entirely
[02:04:42.960 --> 02:04:47.520]  agree with everything you just said there. Ultimately, the real problem is that we don't
[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:51.440]  live in a democracy. We live in a plutocracy ruled by all of that. Stay there. I'm going to come back
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:58.480]  to you, man. And then we're going to go to everybody else that's holding, like Chuck, Michael J, Douglas, and others.
[02:05:00.160 --> 02:05:05.920]  Aging starts at the cellular level. When cells become toxic, they die early and aging sets in.
[02:05:06.640 --> 02:05:12.320]  In the past decade, we have witnessed unparalleled scientific discoveries. During that period,
[02:05:12.320 --> 02:05:18.960]  key patented compounds have focused on mitochondrial growth, nerve growth, and rejuvenation. But no
[02:05:18.960 --> 02:05:24.560]  one has put together a formula that focuses directly on brain health, nerve growth factors,
[02:05:24.560 --> 02:05:29.920]  and optimizing your cellular energy at the same time. We now have the synergistic solution,
[02:05:29.920 --> 02:05:36.880]  DNA force, just one of the key compounds. BiopqQ is backed by major clinical studies,

[02:07:13.840 --> 02:07:18.800]  available through info wars life was invented during doctor group's research on the toxification
[02:07:18.800 --> 02:07:24.400]  of our bodies. Many herbal colon cleansers are harsh on the body and contain cheap and potentially
[02:07:24.400 --> 02:07:30.000]  dangerous ingredients, oftentimes full of synthetic fillers, GMOs, additives or worse.
[02:07:30.000 --> 02:07:34.560]  Gently start cleaning your body with easy capsules that start working while you sleep.
[02:07:34.560 --> 02:07:39.600]  Oxy powder does not require time off work and there's no need for bad taste and concoctions.
[02:07:39.600 --> 02:07:45.280]  Instead, oxy powder slowly releases monoatomic oxygen into the intestinal tract and body.

[02:08:20.880 --> 02:08:36.720]  Well, so does he. It's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network.
[02:08:42.400 --> 02:08:48.720]  I know this. Celebrity politics is not dead, but it's dying. People are sick
[02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:54.640]  of politicians acting like movie stars. They're sick of red carpets. They're sick of Hollywood
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:59.680]  folks surrounding the president. I don't care who they are. We want results. We want transparency.
[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:06.960]  We want freedom and we don't want unsustainable entitlements for foreign banks or illegal
[02:09:06.960 --> 02:09:14.000]  aliens or anybody else. I got a report here in my stack where Illinois pension funds for the
[02:09:14.000 --> 02:09:21.520]  government are $101 billion. You could take all the money over the next 20 years. It's in the
[02:09:21.520 --> 02:09:27.120]  report and it wouldn't pay for that. It's just not going to happen. You're not going to get the money.
[02:09:30.000 --> 02:09:35.200]  They'll default on it or they'll devalue the dollar down to the point you get maybe 10% of it.
[02:09:35.200 --> 02:09:39.920]  And look, a lot of folks that are 60 years old have been paying into their public pension for
[02:09:39.920 --> 02:09:44.720]  all these years. Sorry. It got siphoned off into fraudulent investments and you're getting paid
[02:09:44.720 --> 02:09:50.080]  back too much. You got robbed. Why do you think governments buying armored vehicles and digging
[02:09:50.080 --> 02:09:56.000]  in for war? Because they know this country is going to go crazy and they know the vets are
[02:09:56.000 --> 02:10:03.280]  going to get mad when their pensions get cut off. I'm going to go back to your phone calls. Matt
[02:10:03.280 --> 02:10:08.160]  was making some really good points. He was an Obama supporter and they always counter back,
[02:10:08.160 --> 02:10:12.400]  well, what about the Republicans? I get it. We're going to have him finish up. Then we'll go to Chuck
[02:10:13.600 --> 02:10:21.360]  and Jay and Michael and Bill and others, toll free number to join us, 800-259-9231.
[02:10:23.120 --> 02:10:26.400]  Bill wants to talk about Ferguson and the police. Michael wants to talk about
[02:10:26.960 --> 02:10:31.440]  dent, but dent's gone. We'll get his question. We got Jay who's an Obama supporter.
[02:10:33.120 --> 02:10:37.760]  Chuck's an Obama supporter. We're going to go to them in a minute. But since this got brought up,
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:42.880]  Kit Daniel is one of our great and trepid writers for PrisonPlanet.com and Infowars.com.
[02:10:43.920 --> 02:10:50.880]  Notice this article by Paul Watson. Gruber, key consultant to Obama in 2008 presidential campaign.
[02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:57.840]  Gruber visited Obama's office at the Democratic Party's most influential healthcare expert.
[02:10:59.360 --> 02:11:07.040]  And that's what is basically being said right now. And we have Obama saying it on tape.
[02:11:07.040 --> 02:11:13.360]  Ex Obama aide demolishes New York Times claim that Gruber's role was limited.
[02:11:15.520 --> 02:11:20.640]  MIT professor was the guru of healthcare. Now, before Paul even did this article,
[02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:25.600]  we're thinking on the same page, Kit was doing his article thinking if there's all these videos
[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:30.560]  of Gruber saying he worked with Obama and Obama saying he worked with Gruber as a key
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:39.040]  architect in all of this, then there'll probably be articles about it. And Kit found the article
[02:11:39.920 --> 02:11:46.560]  Tuesday, July 10th, 2007 for Democrats pragmatism on universal healthcare.
[02:11:47.280 --> 02:11:52.320]  And it goes on to say that Jonathan Gruber basically engineered it. On the other side was
[02:11:52.320 --> 02:11:56.160]  the economist from Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has become possibly
[02:11:56.160 --> 02:12:03.520]  the party's most influential healthcare expert. Kit's headline ought to be Washington post
[02:12:03.520 --> 02:12:08.080]  said Gruber was Obama's top expert in 2007.
[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:13.760]  That's before he even got elected, folks.
[02:12:16.480 --> 02:12:20.640]  But I mean, this is a great headline. Gruber, key consultant to Obama in 2008
[02:12:20.640 --> 02:12:27.440]  presidential campaign. But even before that, this is incredible. Listen to this. On the other side
[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:31.360]  was economist from Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has become possibly the party's
[02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:36.320]  most influential healthcare expert and a voice of realism in its internal debates.
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:42.480]  But they're saying he's not key. Obama says he's key. Pelosi says he's key. Harry Reid says he's
[02:12:42.480 --> 02:12:50.880]  key in 2008, 2009, 10, 11, 12, 13. In all the videos we played last hour and that mix up, mash up that
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:56.960]  John Bowne put out that was excellent. But we should add that to all these articles that just
[02:12:56.960 --> 02:13:03.520]  came out. People can see the facts. And then they've got the nerve to sit here and say they've never
[02:13:03.520 --> 02:13:10.320]  heard of him now. Far be it for me to lecture you on politics, Senator Edwards, Jonathan Gruber,
[02:13:10.320 --> 02:13:16.080]  recalled saying, and then he just said that. He told Edwards that whether the merits of a manual's
[02:13:16.080 --> 02:13:20.880]  idea, that's Ezekiel, it just would not be politically viable. Instead, Gruber argued,
[02:13:20.880 --> 02:13:25.360]  for more incremental approach, like the one in Massachusetts, he helped write when it goes through
[02:13:25.360 --> 02:13:31.600]  it, how he was the top guy, how he was involved in 94 with the Clintons, how he's the top guy,
[02:13:31.600 --> 02:13:41.680]  top guy, top guy. Now, let's go to this clip of Stephen Ratner telling MSNBC
[02:13:43.040 --> 02:13:51.600]  that Gruber was, in fact, the quote, guru in putting together the affordable,
[02:13:51.600 --> 02:13:57.040]  rape the American people, greatest con game in history act. This is taken care of by the president,
[02:13:57.040 --> 02:14:02.000]  you know, engaging in politics 101. He's a smart guy we use. He helped us do a lot of really good
[02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:06.000]  things, but he said some stupid things. Instead of Steve pretending like he didn't even know who
[02:14:06.000 --> 02:14:10.960]  he was. I think that's exactly, I think that's exactly the point. Jonathan Gruber was back in
[02:14:10.960 --> 02:14:17.600]  the day in 2009, the guru on healthcare, as you said, he designed the Massachusetts plan for Romney.
[02:14:17.600 --> 02:14:21.280]  I think if you go back and look at the Washington Post or the New York Times or anything from that
[02:14:21.280 --> 02:14:26.560]  period, you will find Jonathan Gruber's name all over it as both someone who's the leading
[02:14:26.560 --> 02:14:30.800]  expert on healthcare quoted by everybody as someone who the White House was using. I don't
[02:14:30.800 --> 02:14:34.640]  think we knew the dollar numbers that he was paid at the time, but he was certainly,
[02:14:35.440 --> 02:14:40.320]  I remember that when I was in the White House, he was certainly viewed as an important figure
[02:14:40.320 --> 02:14:45.280]  in helping to put Obamacare together. And so it's exactly what you said. The problem is not
[02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:50.160]  that Gruber helped them put Obamacare together because he was the man. The problem is what he
[02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:53.840]  said in the last two weeks and how the White House has handled it. You could almost hear David
[02:14:53.840 --> 02:14:59.920]  Axelrod's first. Okay, so there you got it. Okay, he is the top architect. I've been saying he's
[02:14:59.920 --> 02:15:04.480]  one of the top ones. I thought Ezekiel Emanuel was more high-powered, but they're saying he is the
[02:15:04.480 --> 02:15:11.040]  top guy. Now we have a clip of Obama saying he didn't know him. He's not even an aide, basically,
[02:15:11.040 --> 02:15:15.760]  even though he's in videos thanking him. But I want to show TV viewers this and then describe it for
[02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:20.720]  radio listeners. Here's a New York Times article out about the problems Al Sharpton's having with
[02:15:20.720 --> 02:15:30.400]  his finances. Who cares? But in it is a photo of Spike Lee in a photo line with Al Sharpton,
[02:15:30.400 --> 02:15:36.560]  the FBI rat. And if you can see in the photo, I don't know over the camera if you can pick it up,
[02:15:36.560 --> 02:15:43.520]  but the way I'm looking at it, the screen's brighter so you can see it. And he just has
[02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:50.640]  the look in his eye like he's seen God incarnate. He has a look in his eye like he is completely
[02:15:50.640 --> 02:15:57.760]  raptured in some type of narcissistic insanity. And so does Al Sharpton. I mean, I got to tell
[02:15:57.760 --> 02:16:02.960]  you, folks, I could care less about being in a photo line with the president. I could care less
[02:16:02.960 --> 02:16:07.440]  about hanging out with Hollywood stars. I guess because I've done it with Hollywood stars, hung
[02:16:07.440 --> 02:16:13.840]  out with them and everything. I just don't get how even well-known people just literally thought
[02:16:13.840 --> 02:16:19.600]  Obama was God and would save them. I mean, maybe Jamie Foxx really thinks Obama is the Lord and
[02:16:19.600 --> 02:16:25.920]  Savior when he's a Harvard con man. And so I don't think against Obama himself, but when we shoot
[02:16:25.920 --> 02:16:32.880]  him down as a figurehead, we bring these people out of mind control. I mean, you ought to,
[02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:37.440]  if you're going to worship a person, I'm not saying you should worship your mama or your daddy
[02:16:38.880 --> 02:16:42.400]  or your grandma, or I mean, or somebody that stood up for you in your life,
[02:16:42.400 --> 02:16:46.400]  or somebody that gave you a good job and mentored you. Those are the heroes out there,
[02:16:46.400 --> 02:16:51.440]  not Barack Obama never did anything in his life. Some Harvard slime bag.
[02:16:55.920 --> 02:17:00.640]  I'm going to throw up. Okay, I'm sorry. I need to get to the calls. Matt in Oklahoma. So you say
[02:17:00.640 --> 02:17:04.480]  you were an Obama supporter. You just want to know why am I endorsing the Republicans? Well,
[02:17:04.480 --> 02:17:09.440]  I'm not endorsing Bush. I'm not endorsing Jeb Bush. I'm endorsing people I know that are principled
[02:17:09.440 --> 02:17:14.080]  like Rand Paul. Does that mean he's perfect? No. But clearly it's an expression of the
[02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:20.320]  deepness of the corruption in politics now that the Democratic Party has entered
[02:17:21.040 --> 02:17:24.640]  just an insane asylum level of corruption. Go ahead.
[02:17:25.920 --> 02:17:30.800]  Right. I wasn't necessarily saying that you're endorsing the right over the left per se. It's
[02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:36.160]  just that whenever, you know, if you use any ad hominid comments, quote unquote, obozo,
[02:17:36.160 --> 02:17:41.440]  libtard, those kinds of things, it drops your level of conversation down.
[02:17:41.440 --> 02:17:44.000]  I totally agree. But listen, listen, at a certain point,
[02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:51.040]  I just am sick of talking about them, but I have to fight them. And it's not true. He's not a
[02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:56.080]  bozo. He's a hardcore con artist. And, and, you know, liberals libtard, I've been called a Paul
[02:17:56.080 --> 02:18:02.640]  bot or whatever. I mean, I get it. I get it. So I hear you. I should try to be more professional.
[02:18:03.520 --> 02:18:06.640]  Well, it's just not that. I don't want to say that you're not professional. You're,
[02:18:06.640 --> 02:18:10.720]  you got to be one of the top notch guys that that's the only reliable news that we have
[02:18:10.720 --> 02:18:16.880]  on, on available to the public these days. But the two things that I wanted to bring up real
[02:18:16.880 --> 02:18:22.320]  fast was the two things that would basically fix the country. One is the electoral college needs
[02:18:22.320 --> 02:18:28.880]  to go. It just needs we need to get rid of that because the president is not picked by the people.
[02:18:28.880 --> 02:18:35.200]  It's all a buddy buddy system. I could go on for for quite a while on that. And then we need internet
[02:18:35.200 --> 02:18:41.600]  voting. You could debate for quite a while on those, you know, how to do it safely. But
[02:18:42.400 --> 02:18:46.720]  most people are really apathetic these days. And if you could, you got so many people that
[02:18:46.720 --> 02:18:51.440]  can click the like button on stuff, you know, if you could make it that easy to vote, people might
[02:18:51.440 --> 02:18:56.640]  actually turn out. Unfortunately, I hear what you're saying. And I understand the electoral
[02:18:56.640 --> 02:19:03.200]  college. I appreciate your call can be gamed. Here's the problem. The original colonies didn't
[02:19:03.200 --> 02:19:10.000]  want one like New York or Massachusetts to be able to out vote one like Maine that had,
[02:19:10.560 --> 02:19:14.240]  I think it was like at the time of the ratification, maybe 7% of the population.
[02:19:15.120 --> 02:19:21.760]  So they could then vote to make them do whatever they wanted. So the senators were elected by the
[02:19:21.760 --> 02:19:26.720]  legislature. So they were creatures of the state. And the House members were popularly elected,
[02:19:26.720 --> 02:19:32.160]  but only apportioned for the populations because New York didn't want to be dominated by small
[02:19:32.160 --> 02:19:40.240]  state. See, it's all about balancing. And if you get rid of the electoral college, California
[02:19:40.240 --> 02:19:45.360]  could bring in 100 million illegals and dominate the whole country and tell you what to do. So I
[02:19:45.360 --> 02:19:51.840]  mean, really, the American people need to become virtuous and angry and get involved. That's what
[02:19:51.840 --> 02:19:57.360]  will change things. I appreciate your call. All right, we're gonna come right back to Chuck and
[02:19:57.360 --> 02:20:03.040]  others straight ahead. And then Jay, stay with us. Digestive health is key to wellness and ProEM1

[02:24:21.040 --> 02:24:24.880]  The truth is there's a bunch of foreign special entrants that took over both parties.
[02:24:25.600 --> 02:24:29.680]  I don't care if it was Republican or Democrat party that had some insurrection in it.
[02:24:30.560 --> 02:24:37.200]  We've got to try to get some voice of the people back in there for general prosperity. If they cut
[02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:42.800]  taxes massively and cut off a lot of foreign corporate welfare and made big corporations
[02:24:42.800 --> 02:24:47.760]  send some of their tax money back here instead of being tax exempt, then you could take the load
[02:24:47.760 --> 02:24:52.480]  off little people and get the economy going. But they don't do that. And now I've got to tell you,
[02:24:52.480 --> 02:24:57.440]  I never expected Democrats to raise taxes on poor people like Obamacare did. I mean,
[02:24:58.000 --> 02:25:04.720]  Obamacare was so bad when I was reading it that I couldn't believe it. I mean, it's mean.
[02:25:05.760 --> 02:25:09.280]  I mean, the Democratic party of John F. Kennedy was the opposite,
[02:25:11.280 --> 02:25:15.600]  the opposite of what the Democrats are today. And it had big problems.
[02:25:15.600 --> 02:25:22.080]  But, I mean, how they get unions is important after and again. How they get unions is
[02:25:22.080 --> 02:25:27.600]  for Obamacare that wrecks them. I mean, I'd be for unions a hundred years ago against the
[02:25:27.600 --> 02:25:31.840]  Rockefellers and some check and balance. But now they've just turned into mafias where they
[02:25:31.840 --> 02:25:36.800]  take their people's money and then use it against them. Chuck in Michigan, you're on the air. Thanks
[02:25:36.800 --> 02:25:44.480]  for holding. Welcome. Hi, Alex. Yes, sir. Oh, thank you for taking my call. How are you?
[02:25:44.480 --> 02:25:50.800]  I'm good. Are you really an Obama supporter? In a certain way, yes, I am. I believe that he is
[02:25:50.800 --> 02:25:56.640]  the necessary part. I believe he's playing a necessary role in our country just because
[02:25:57.440 --> 02:26:01.040]  I think he's going to teach us a valuable lesson that we're just going to make a stronger in the
[02:26:01.040 --> 02:26:05.760]  end. I believe just like a hot burner on a stove, we're going to have to burn ourselves on him.
[02:26:05.760 --> 02:26:09.520]  And we will learn never to repeat socialist mistakes again in the future.
[02:26:09.520 --> 02:26:15.600]  But will we repeat fascist activities of the Republicans? I mean, look,
[02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:19.520]  the Republicans, what do we do about the Republicans helping right the stinking thing?
[02:26:19.520 --> 02:26:22.160]  What are we going to do about Mitt Romney praising Gruber?
[02:26:23.280 --> 02:26:28.000]  That's a major concern of mine as well. Just the fact the Republicans voted to even fund it,
[02:26:28.000 --> 02:26:32.080]  I really did not support them ending the government shutdown. I thought they were going
[02:26:32.080 --> 02:26:36.560]  to carry it out longer and I felt pretty let down. I mean, I voted straight Republican this
[02:26:36.560 --> 02:26:40.640]  election. I just kind of for the first time in my life went for the lesser of two evils.
[02:26:40.640 --> 02:26:45.920]  Sure. And it's because they know we have nowhere to run, but this time it is a major sea change.
[02:26:45.920 --> 02:26:49.360]  If we keep pushing, if we move all our anger down to the Republican leadership
[02:26:50.160 --> 02:26:53.200]  and tell them you're not movie stars, Mitch McConnell and Boehner,
[02:26:53.200 --> 02:26:59.600]  stop playing golf with Obama, repeal it now scum, indict Gruber. I mean, we need to start
[02:26:59.600 --> 02:27:05.280]  punishing criminals here. I just don't know how to go about starting to do that myself.
[02:27:05.280 --> 02:27:11.760]  I hear you. I hear you, brother. Good to hear from you. Jay is a Obama supporter.
[02:27:11.760 --> 02:27:16.160]  Let's see if he's for real or more satirical comments. Jay, we've had two real callers of
[02:27:16.160 --> 02:27:22.320]  about 10 so-called Obama supporters. Are you the unicorn? Are you a real bona fide Obama supporter?
[02:27:23.520 --> 02:27:28.080]  Well, like I said, Alex, I've been on hold here for many. I've been listening to a lot of stuff
[02:27:28.080 --> 02:27:33.360]  you guys have been talking about. I'm just saying that I feel like Obama is getting a really hard
[02:27:33.360 --> 02:27:39.680]  rep on this right now because I looked at Kentucky and Kentucky renewed their Medicaid and Medicare
[02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:45.280]  under their governor and you have Nathan Deal in Georgia who did not renew it and therefore cost
[02:27:45.280 --> 02:27:50.640]  of winning up here. So why is Kentucky getting better savings under Obamacare than us? And why
[02:27:50.640 --> 02:27:55.760]  is Obama getting the blame for it when it was a governor's fault? Well, that's how they spent it
[02:27:55.760 --> 02:28:00.560]  saying governors didn't go along with it. It's because they can't fund an unfunded mandate.
[02:28:00.560 --> 02:28:06.000]  They're already maxed out. This bill was deceptive from the start. So they're trying to blame the
[02:28:06.000 --> 02:28:12.640]  states. It's not true. They're using more deception. Like I predicted the website wouldn't work on purpose
[02:28:13.600 --> 02:28:19.120]  so that they could keep denying and pushing it off in phases and that's what they did and they
[02:28:19.120 --> 02:28:24.720]  really use it for the Democrats to cull people's identities and to create a database of who doesn't
[02:28:24.720 --> 02:28:31.600]  have healthcare to find you. You were reporting to the IRS and now they admit that and people ask,
[02:28:31.600 --> 02:28:36.720]  are you an insider? Do you work for them? How do you know all this? I know the MO of these criminals,
[02:28:36.720 --> 02:28:43.760]  man. I mean, I mean, I know how to go duck hunting. I've been duck hunting 20 times in my life. I'm
[02:28:43.760 --> 02:28:49.360]  not a master, but I know how to call ducks up. I know how to shoot them with a 10 gauge. I know how
[02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:55.200]  they freaking know how to shoot them, man. I mean, I know how to mow the yard. I know how to,
[02:28:55.200 --> 02:28:59.440]  you know, back before I was married, I know how to go pick up a lady. I mean, I know how
[02:28:59.440 --> 02:29:05.040]  con artists operate and I knew what they were going to do and so they did it. I know how their
[02:29:05.040 --> 02:29:11.040]  scams work and I just want the public to get wise of this. You see what I'm saying? No, I understand
[02:29:11.040 --> 02:29:14.800]  what you're saying and that very well might be true. I've been like I said, I've been doing some
[02:29:14.800 --> 02:29:20.560]  research and I'm open minded to hear what the truth is all about. But also, I think that it
[02:29:20.560 --> 02:29:25.840]  isn't just Obamacare that is going to be causing the trouble. This is a personal opinion. I might
[02:29:25.840 --> 02:29:30.800]  be wrong, but I believe that the Federal Reserve ultimately that is printing all this money and
[02:29:30.800 --> 02:29:34.960]  we're about to be at 18, 19 trillion in debt. Yeah, that's who runs it. I'm going to come back to you
[02:29:34.960 --> 02:29:39.840]  and we'll go to our reporters and back to their calls. But yes, that's it. Don't forget above the
[02:29:39.840 --> 02:29:44.880]  puppet since the Federal Reserve. But sir, when I'm going to ask you when we come back, what does
[02:29:44.880 --> 02:29:51.520]  Gruber mean to you saying he conned you? It's not the States. We're on the march. The empire's on
[02:29:51.520 --> 02:29:55.760]  the run. Not a face Gruber. Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.

[02:33:20.880 --> 02:33:34.480]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance live from Austin, Texas,
[02:33:34.480 --> 02:33:38.160]  broadcasting worldwide. The power of their show.
[02:33:41.840 --> 02:33:48.480]  So the Washington Post said back in 2007, the Democratic Party's top advisor on government run
[02:33:48.480 --> 02:33:56.880]  health care was Jonathan Gruber. And I know I keep obsessing on Gruber. It's because last
[02:33:56.880 --> 02:34:01.760]  Sunday, Monday, they took the video down, blocked it, said it didn't exist, said he was a nobody,
[02:34:01.760 --> 02:34:06.320]  and now we're just routing them. This is a type of story where people don't care about the open
[02:34:06.320 --> 02:34:10.560]  crime against them, even their own bank accounts being robbed, the death panels, the vets not
[02:34:10.560 --> 02:34:22.080]  being given treatment, but to see him snickering and giggling because he's MIT. So when you lie
[02:34:22.080 --> 02:34:27.840]  to us and rape us financially and run a scam, it's trendy because you're talking a little
[02:34:27.840 --> 02:34:36.960]  trendy voice. That makes it okay. We're sick of you. We want it repealed and they're freaking out
[02:34:36.960 --> 02:34:41.520]  now. The Republicans are suddenly, we're like, we're not going to repeal it. Okay, we'll look at
[02:34:41.520 --> 02:34:48.080]  it. No, you will repeal it, Boehner. You will repeal it, McConnell. I'm sorry. You tell those foreign
[02:34:48.080 --> 02:34:54.720]  banks that you gave billions and spent billions to state and the federal government to buy off
[02:34:54.720 --> 02:35:00.720]  this country that we're not for sale. I mean, you idiots really thought you could bring something in
[02:35:00.720 --> 02:35:06.560]  like this? Well, yeah, you want to have totally open borders now and give them all free health care
[02:35:06.560 --> 02:35:17.360]  and Obama's going to rule by executive order. No, no, no. You will die politically, to quote
[02:35:17.360 --> 02:35:30.080]  Emperor Palpatine. I mean, people are sick of it. Jay in Georgia, then we're going to our reporters,
[02:35:30.080 --> 02:35:35.680]  we're in front of the Justice Center. That's what they call the county seat now, not a courthouse,
[02:35:35.680 --> 02:35:43.280]  but a Justice Center. Let's go ahead and talk to Jay, who want to finish up his point. Go ahead, Jay.
[02:35:44.640 --> 02:35:50.480]  Yeah, what I was saying is that there is a bigger man behind this curtain altogether. I mean, I don't
[02:35:50.480 --> 02:35:54.400]  know who's the blame. I feel like everybody's passing blame around like a top potato. It is
[02:35:54.400 --> 02:35:59.680]  just a big distraction. Ultimately, I'm just saying I don't think Obama is the main blame. I think
[02:35:59.680 --> 02:36:05.040]  there's a lot of hands in this pot. And to put it all on just Obama, I think is you're going to miss
[02:36:05.040 --> 02:36:08.960]  other people that are also bringing like the Federal Reserve. Well, I agree with you. But listen,
[02:36:10.000 --> 02:36:14.480]  he's the figurehead. So you have to bring him down. Well, listen, do you want to get rid of it? Or
[02:36:14.480 --> 02:36:20.960]  do you think it's still a wonderful deal? Well, ultimately, I haven't read the thing. And I think
[02:36:21.520 --> 02:36:24.960]  there's a lot of things that are wrong about it. But what about preexisting conditions?
[02:36:25.920 --> 02:36:31.360]  Well, Obamacare doesn't cover that said clearly in the bill. It doesn't doesn't cover kids. It's
[02:36:31.360 --> 02:36:36.400]  it's all lies. I mean, do you think let me ask you a question. Do you think insurance companies
[02:36:37.040 --> 02:36:41.680]  run by big foreign megabanks, the very same banks that funded both sides of World War Two
[02:36:41.680 --> 02:36:46.480]  and World War One and the Napoleonic Wars, the most cutthroat families in the world?
[02:36:46.480 --> 02:36:50.560]  Do you think they want to take control of our health care because they care about you, buddy?
[02:36:52.640 --> 02:36:55.680]  Well, I know a lot of these people are members of the Council of Foreign Relations,
[02:36:55.680 --> 02:37:01.440]  the secret organization. I have no clue about it. Brother, brother, they admit it's a screwed job.
[02:37:01.440 --> 02:37:04.800]  So we say there's a lot of blame to go around. This is what I always hear
[02:37:04.800 --> 02:37:08.720]  from people that have been screwed over. And that's why they keep coming to screw you
[02:37:08.720 --> 02:37:12.560]  over is because you can't admit you've been cheated. I appreciate your call.
[02:37:13.280 --> 02:37:17.040]  Were there problems with our health care system? Yes, because government involvement.
[02:37:18.720 --> 02:37:22.080]  We had hands down 30, 40 years ago, the best health care system in the world.
[02:37:22.080 --> 02:37:26.640]  The British royalty came here, Dutch royalty, Japanese royalty came here to get health care.
[02:37:26.640 --> 02:37:33.760]  They don't come here now. Our health care is falling apart. My family is in medical management.
[02:37:34.400 --> 02:37:39.280]  I interview all the top experts on air, brain surgeons, scientists. I mean,
[02:37:39.280 --> 02:37:44.720]  I know what I'm talking about, okay? But they always put into a process,
[02:37:45.440 --> 02:37:48.960]  oh, their secret death list all over the country did not give care to veterans.
[02:37:48.960 --> 02:37:53.280]  They turn and say, oh, we're investigating the mistake. Oh, there's not list. Oh, yeah, there are.
[02:37:54.960 --> 02:37:58.320]  We're not teaching fifth graders in Illinois how to have anal sex.
[02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:02.880]  That was an accident. And they find it at all the schools. They're doing it. They play the,
[02:38:02.880 --> 02:38:06.400]  oh, we're not giving kids inoculations. Really, we caught you. I mean, it was an accident. Oh,
[02:38:07.200 --> 02:38:10.000]  you really think the nurses are lining kids up, giving them shots,
[02:38:10.880 --> 02:38:13.520]  violation of law without the government saying, do it.
[02:38:13.520 --> 02:38:21.840]  But it's a, it's government and corporations doing whatever they want. We're not going to arrest
[02:38:21.840 --> 02:38:28.880]  illegals. We're going to arrest citizens for no reason. We're seen as chumps because you watch
[02:38:28.880 --> 02:38:34.560]  television. Everybody is in this arrested development where they all act like kids. Everybody says,
[02:38:34.560 --> 02:38:44.480]  happy, happy, like a bunch of lobotomized teletubbies. And that's not how reality works. Anytime you
[02:38:44.480 --> 02:38:48.880]  create a big giant central government and give it a bunch of power, you just built the instrument
[02:38:48.880 --> 02:38:56.880]  of your destruction. That's history. We live 75 years on average. We go through the same cycles.
[02:38:56.880 --> 02:39:03.760]  We behave the same. I don't care. We got spaceships. We act the same. And we are in deep, deep,
[02:39:03.760 --> 02:39:11.760]  deep Obama. And that's not an ad hominem attack. It's a joke. Let's go to our reporters and then
[02:39:11.760 --> 02:39:17.200]  to the callers. Jacarie Jackson and Joe Biggs, join us. I guess Jacarie's on the line first.
[02:39:17.920 --> 02:39:22.160]  Oh, Joe Biggs is on first. Thank you. Joe Biggs in front of the courthouse there,
[02:39:22.800 --> 02:39:27.840]  outside Ferguson. He's at the county seat. What's the new intel you've got there during the Arctic,
[02:39:27.840 --> 02:39:38.320]  Al Gore warming extravaganza on the verdict there in Missouri. It's quite shocking. I expected
[02:39:38.320 --> 02:39:43.280]  global warming to be a lot warmer. It's 18 degrees, but I guess that's another subject. Well,
[02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:48.480]  if you paid Al Gore more carbon tax money and the Rothschilds more money on their exchange,
[02:39:48.480 --> 02:39:55.120]  then we'd be better off you racist. Well, yeah, we're standing right outside of the what they
[02:39:55.120 --> 02:40:01.280]  call the justice center. And we have CBS news, Fox news right over here. Everyone's still awaiting
[02:40:01.280 --> 02:40:05.520]  a word to find out when the verdict is going to come out. I have someone on the inside who's
[02:40:05.520 --> 02:40:10.720]  going to shoot me a text when that comes when that information is put out. Well done. I do have,
[02:40:10.720 --> 02:40:16.880]  I do have some, some other big information though as well. I just got the location of the command
[02:40:16.880 --> 02:40:21.840]  center where the military and DHS is. So after we get off here, we're going to go out there and
[02:40:21.840 --> 02:40:27.280]  investigate that get footage and shoot a report. I've already seen some footage from a local. He
[02:40:27.280 --> 02:40:32.080]  sent me a little bit and it looks legit. It's pretty big. So we're going to go out there and
[02:40:32.080 --> 02:40:36.880]  do a report on that. But those guys look like they're well stocked up and ready. But you know,
[02:40:36.880 --> 02:40:42.240]  one of the funny things is, is, you know, I sat down and had some lunch a little bit ago when I,
[02:40:42.240 --> 02:40:47.520]  you know, the restaurant had Fox news on and it's showing all these pictures of stuff in
[02:40:47.520 --> 02:40:51.120]  August where everyone's out in the street and it makes it look they're portraying like there's this
[02:40:51.120 --> 02:40:57.840]  huge war. There's like constant chaos going on in the St. Louis surrounding areas, Ferguson,
[02:40:57.840 --> 02:41:03.440]  Clayton, all these areas. And right now it's so cold. No one's out. You know, yesterday there was
[02:41:03.440 --> 02:41:09.040]  maybe a 20 minute protest and the headline was protest or storm courthouse. We were out there.
[02:41:09.040 --> 02:41:14.880]  There's no protest or stormed any courthouse whatsoever. So it seems like the government
[02:41:14.880 --> 02:41:20.640]  wants chaos. They want blood. They want riots. The mainstream media is feeding that fear. They want
[02:41:20.640 --> 02:41:26.160]  that they want complete and total collapse. So then again, they can state their martial law,
[02:41:26.160 --> 02:41:31.120]  bring in the National Guard and have, you know, weapon, you know, people with soldiers with weapons,
[02:41:31.120 --> 02:41:34.000]  cops everywhere in riot gear walking up and down the streets. Once again,
[02:41:36.480 --> 02:41:42.240]  elaborate on any intel you're getting. I mean, still no word on when they're going to either
[02:41:42.240 --> 02:41:47.440]  indict or not indict the police officer. Not yet. I mean, at any point, I mean, it would make sense
[02:41:47.440 --> 02:41:51.920]  to do it now when it's freezing cold. I mean, anybody you see walking down the street, they're
[02:41:51.920 --> 02:41:56.560]  going from their car and they're running indoors as fast as possible because it is not a pleasant,
[02:41:56.560 --> 02:42:00.560]  you know, it's not pleasant to be outside whatsoever. So I mean, now you would think would
[02:42:00.560 --> 02:42:05.200]  be the time to release that information, going ahead and let it get out there and let people
[02:42:05.200 --> 02:42:09.040]  eventually just calm down and said they're going to wait. It's going to warm up and it's going to
[02:42:09.040 --> 02:42:12.960]  turn into August all over. That's right. I would announce it at like five in the morning
[02:42:12.960 --> 02:42:18.400]  so that the word goes out, you know, the gang bangers and people are asleep till later in the
[02:42:18.400 --> 02:42:22.160]  day. Regular hard work and folks aren't going to, you know, go out and tear anything up. They're
[02:42:22.160 --> 02:42:25.760]  going to go out and demonstrate. Great. That's their right. We support it. And then, you know,
[02:42:25.760 --> 02:42:29.760]  that's their right to do that. A lot of folks fought for that right. It's a God given right,
[02:42:29.760 --> 02:42:35.840]  not from the state. But and then you'd have all day to see if anything formed to be able to deal
[02:42:35.840 --> 02:42:40.800]  with any violence instead. I got a feeling they'll announce it some night at about seven, right at
[02:42:40.800 --> 02:42:46.400]  dark because the whole way they've been running this is to try to get it going. Well, once we see
[02:42:46.400 --> 02:42:50.800]  what this command center is up to, we'll know if they're mobilizing, get ready to push into this
[02:42:50.800 --> 02:42:56.000]  area and not because I think that's what the governor's waiting on for their, you know, strategic
[02:42:56.000 --> 02:43:01.120]  placement of these guys. So when they do announce it and they do put it out, they've got their,
[02:43:01.120 --> 02:43:05.520]  you know, their pawns and position for ultimately what we think will happen will be
[02:43:05.520 --> 02:43:09.120]  complete and total utter chaos happening out here in the streets. But it's so cold right now.
[02:43:09.120 --> 02:43:12.960]  You're not going to have a lot of people running up down the road protesting for longer than 30
[02:43:12.960 --> 02:43:20.400]  minutes. I mean, it's pretty frigid. Well, expanding on that homeland security CNN now report on what
[02:43:20.400 --> 02:43:26.960]  we covered back on Sunday with you guys live on air. And that's that this this fella shot video,
[02:43:26.960 --> 02:43:34.400]  the DHS vehicles and photos put it up on the internet and they got him fired. So be careful
[02:43:34.400 --> 02:43:38.000]  when you go videotape the command base, but I would just be out in the open because I've
[02:43:38.000 --> 02:43:42.320]  noticed if you sneak around and they think that means you're bad. What are you planning when you
[02:43:42.320 --> 02:43:47.600]  go to this federal command base? Because I mean, I want to be here obviously by the phone or by
[02:43:47.600 --> 02:43:53.440]  the Skype with you guys feeding us a live Skype feed in case they try something with you. Yeah,
[02:43:53.440 --> 02:43:59.280]  it's where we're at now in Clayton. I just looked it up on the map. It's about a 20 minute drive
[02:43:59.280 --> 02:44:04.560]  south of where we're at now. It's behind a gas station and what looks like a pretty open area.
[02:44:04.560 --> 02:44:09.280]  So I was thinking about setting up in the field across the street at first, just to get some
[02:44:09.280 --> 02:44:14.800]  footage and then push it a little bit closer and then see if I can get some up close stuff.
[02:44:14.800 --> 02:44:18.640]  You know, I'm pretty sure the way they're acting like with the DHS, how they, you know,
[02:44:18.640 --> 02:44:22.480]  got that got fired, someone's going to come up and approach us. And that's fine. I mean,
[02:44:22.480 --> 02:44:26.960]  that's huge news if they try to stop you doing what you're supposed to do. They're not going.
[02:44:26.960 --> 02:44:31.200]  I mean, they can try, but I know my rights. I'm going to go up there and I want to film because
[02:44:31.200 --> 02:44:36.400]  that's why my God given right. That's right. Once you get there, Joe Biggs and Jacarie Jackson,
[02:44:37.040 --> 02:44:41.280]  call Rob, dude, call the office, even though we won't be live or on the air until night at
[02:44:41.280 --> 02:44:48.240]  seven o'clock central with the nightly news, but let's have you Skype back live to us so we can
[02:44:48.240 --> 02:44:54.160]  capture that in case they try something. And because I mean, you already had one cop run up and say,
[02:44:54.160 --> 02:45:00.480]  you know, I'll effing kill you with a shotgun for no reason. By the way, he was suspended. Did we
[02:45:00.480 --> 02:45:05.520]  ever find out what happened to him? I haven't heard anything new from that, from what you just
[02:45:05.520 --> 02:45:09.520]  said as well. So I'm not sure I can find that out. You're pretty soon though. I know a lot of the,
[02:45:10.160 --> 02:45:14.080]  the people are starting to show up that we're here back in August. I know some of them have kept
[02:45:14.080 --> 02:45:18.160]  in touch with that. So I can find that out pretty quickly. All right. Well, just take a moment.
[02:45:18.160 --> 02:45:22.720]  Let's get Jacarie in front of the camera and then I'll get his take on anything. Joe, thank you so
[02:45:22.720 --> 02:45:27.520]  much. That's Joe Biggs. Thank you up there reporting. And they're going to be there live when the
[02:45:27.520 --> 02:45:32.320]  verdict comes out. And so even if we're not live on the air or on the nightly news at the time,
[02:45:32.320 --> 02:45:38.560]  there will be a live feed. They'll call Kit Daniels or Don Salazar, Kurt Nemo or
[02:45:39.600 --> 02:45:44.800]  Mikhail Thaylon or Anthony Uchiarty, any of the riders. And we will have that live you stream
[02:45:44.800 --> 02:45:52.320]  feed up for you so you can see what's happening there on the ground at info wars.com and prison
[02:45:52.320 --> 02:45:59.440]  planet.com. And if we find out the verdicts happening and there are riots or any issues,
[02:45:59.440 --> 02:46:03.520]  we will expand info wars nightly news tonight and I'll even come back
[02:46:05.520 --> 02:46:10.560]  and do live coverage because this could spread around the country. I hope the cold weather keeps
[02:46:10.560 --> 02:46:15.680]  it from getting violent. But the way the media has hyped it, it's almost like they're trying to put
[02:46:15.680 --> 02:46:20.160]  the idea in people's minds. Jacarie, what do you think about the situation?
[02:46:20.160 --> 02:46:25.440]  I have to echo what Joe says. You know, me, you get out here and check out this command center
[02:46:25.440 --> 02:46:29.600]  they have posted up a little bit south of here. But like you said, for the time we're out here
[02:46:29.600 --> 02:46:34.800]  from the Justice Center, this is where we saw our protests and our rallies yesterday. It's been pretty
[02:46:34.800 --> 02:46:40.240]  cold, not a whole lot of people are frequently in the area, just the normal business people
[02:46:40.240 --> 02:46:45.920]  that live and work in this area. But yes, we do see a huge buildup. Governor Nixon has said that
[02:46:45.920 --> 02:46:51.440]  he's ready to mobilize the National Guard. So I would expect that they are planning to announce
[02:46:51.440 --> 02:46:55.840]  the verdict here pretty soon. What's going to happen after that? You know, this would be the
[02:46:55.840 --> 02:46:59.680]  best time to announce it. As far as I'm concerned, if they don't want a lot of people in the streets,
[02:46:59.680 --> 02:47:05.520]  you know, it's ungodly cold out here. It's going to warm up a little bit later this week. I think
[02:47:05.520 --> 02:47:11.200]  tomorrow's supposed to get around 50 or so. But at the moment, it's about 1817 degrees. So if they
[02:47:11.200 --> 02:47:18.080]  want to do it, this would be the ideal time to minimize the people in the streets. I think from
[02:47:18.080 --> 02:47:21.920]  a lot of different angles, the feds are trying to provocateur a big event to get more funding and
[02:47:21.920 --> 02:47:26.960]  federalize things more. The fact that they haven't announced the verdict yet when it's cold and should.
[02:47:26.960 --> 02:47:34.000]  If they announce it at night, I find that very, very suspicious. What's your gut on what's overall
[02:47:34.000 --> 02:47:39.040]  happening? I mean, who are the good guys? Who are the bad guys in your heart, Jacari? What do you
[02:47:39.040 --> 02:47:44.480]  think is really going on here? Well, I do agree that, you know, they would like to see a huge
[02:47:44.480 --> 02:47:50.320]  spectacle of force, you know, a need to come out here in the big MRAPs and all that stuff.
[02:47:50.320 --> 02:47:55.440]  You know, it's not really justifiable to come out with all the big, heavy armor in the military.
[02:47:55.440 --> 02:47:59.760]  Just like we saw in Boston, you know, for one fugitive, a total power grab.
[02:47:59.760 --> 02:48:03.360]  Yeah, you know, you have one guy who's running around hiding in somebody's boat.
[02:48:03.360 --> 02:48:06.800]  So, you know, they need SWAT teams going door to door, drawing people out. And they said,
[02:48:06.800 --> 02:48:10.240]  well, we didn't force anybody out. You just suck a gun in their face and ask them to please leave
[02:48:10.240 --> 02:48:14.000]  their premises. Yeah, I'm sure most people would walk out of the house and under those
[02:48:14.000 --> 02:48:18.960]  circumstances. So, yeah, I think if they wanted to minimize the damage or potential damage,
[02:48:18.960 --> 02:48:24.320]  they would release it now. But, you know, if it gets warmer outside, you have more people out in
[02:48:24.320 --> 02:48:28.480]  the streets. But what I think is going to happen, the reason, reasoning behind this, you know,
[02:48:28.480 --> 02:48:32.880]  when we were here originally back in August, we were talking to some of the people, even a local
[02:48:32.880 --> 02:48:37.360]  minister, and she said to me and basically like, I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist,
[02:48:37.360 --> 02:48:41.120]  but I think they're out here letting some people loot and everything because you guys remember
[02:48:41.120 --> 02:48:46.080]  the command base we showed you last time that was at a shopping center that was right down the street
[02:48:46.080 --> 02:48:49.920]  from where all the chaos happened, where they burned down the gas station and all that. And,
[02:48:49.920 --> 02:48:53.440]  you know, these guys were pretty much sitting on their hands as some of the more
[02:48:54.320 --> 02:48:58.960]  lucid things were going on in the area. But when you have peaceful people, a largely
[02:48:58.960 --> 02:49:03.200]  peaceful crowd, then they come out with the MRAPs aiming guns at people in the crowd,
[02:49:03.200 --> 02:49:06.720]  then, you know, you aim a gun at anybody that's going to get them fired up. So, then, you know,
[02:49:06.720 --> 02:49:11.760]  you have more people come out and some people are more prepared to do more radical actions
[02:49:11.760 --> 02:49:16.560]  than just, you know, stand there peacefully protest. And then they lied to Kari and said that they
[02:49:16.560 --> 02:49:20.720]  weren't shooting tear gas at you, even though you picked up a canister, even though Joe,
[02:49:20.720 --> 02:49:24.080]  I mean, you guys showed rubber bullets all over the ground, Joe got hit by them.
[02:49:24.080 --> 02:49:28.960]  I mean, it's just the level of lying is the problem. The level of lying, my favorite one,
[02:49:28.960 --> 02:49:34.720]  besides the tear gas and even the rubber bullets, you know, we reported day one on that Tuesday
[02:49:34.720 --> 02:49:39.200]  that they had it pretty much installed a curfew. And then the next day, the police chief, I believe
[02:49:39.200 --> 02:49:43.120]  it was Jackson, he comes out. He's like, there's no curfew. We're just, you know, showing up at
[02:49:43.120 --> 02:49:46.720]  6 p.m. aiming guns at people and then threatening to arrest them if they don't get off the street.
[02:49:46.720 --> 02:49:51.040]  But that's not a curfew. I guess that doesn't constitute a curfew. Even though they had publicly
[02:49:51.040 --> 02:49:57.280]  announced it again, it's the lying by government discredits police. When at first we were kind
[02:49:57.280 --> 02:50:01.440]  of like, yeah, these looters are bad. Looks like the police are trying to maintain order
[02:50:01.440 --> 02:50:05.200]  the first few days. We weren't being negative to the police is that they were doing a pretty good
[02:50:05.200 --> 02:50:10.480]  job. And they started attacking reporters and leaving looters alone. Just just just just very,
[02:50:10.480 --> 02:50:15.600]  very sad. Jacarie Jackson, we will continue to watch and listen to your coverage and the special

[02:54:23.280 --> 02:54:27.440]  I tell you folks,
[02:54:31.120 --> 02:54:36.400]  we're talking about Obama right now. He's the front man for all this, and we've got Obama supporters
[02:54:36.400 --> 02:54:40.080]  calling in. They seem like nice folks, but they're like, well, I'm going to check into it. I don't
[02:54:40.080 --> 02:54:55.520]  know if I believe you. Gruber is telling you that they're devils. Listen to the song. They're telling
[02:54:55.520 --> 02:55:04.560]  you though. They're in red pajamas. They're not in disguise. That's how much disdain they have for
[02:55:04.560 --> 02:55:09.840]  you. I don't. I know when you dumb other people down and screw people over, it comes back on you.
[02:55:13.920 --> 02:55:22.400]  Yeah. Riddle that overdrive too so I can tell everybody. Michael and Bill, Barbara, Rick, and
[02:55:22.400 --> 02:55:28.640]  Daniel, that'll be it. Before we go any further, again, we're going to sell out a survival shield,
[02:55:28.640 --> 02:55:37.280]  nasa9ix2. We are going to sell out of the B12. Unfortunately, very, very quickly,
[02:55:38.080 --> 02:55:42.480]  we had another shipment of it that came in because they'd overproduced. They even overage,
[02:55:42.480 --> 02:55:47.680]  but that is going to sell out within a matter of days. DNA force, all of it. And when it's sold

[02:56:30.880 --> 02:56:38.080]  or 888-253-3139. Let's go ahead and talk to Michael in Florida. You're on the air. I know
[02:56:38.080 --> 02:56:41.360]  you've been holding to talk to Dent, but I had to finish up with the other people. Go ahead.
[02:56:41.360 --> 02:56:47.600]  It's all right, Alex. What I wanted to see you do is actually make a film called Living the
[02:56:47.600 --> 02:56:52.960]  Contradiction instead of Living the Dream. Because a lot of these politicians, they kind of
[02:56:52.960 --> 02:56:59.200]  contradict what they're doing. And my question for Dent was, where do you think this country's
[02:56:59.200 --> 02:57:04.240]  money is going after the holidays? Because I think just like the tradition of the last couple
[02:57:04.240 --> 02:57:10.960]  presidents, they had several different crises going out of office. So I think the money
[02:57:12.000 --> 02:57:16.480]  didn't spend on different things like that. But that's pretty much my question.
[02:57:16.480 --> 02:57:20.560]  Oh, that's a great question. I wish we had him here to get his take. I think they'll start more
[02:57:20.560 --> 02:57:25.200]  wars. I think they'll pull some more crises, maybe a false flag terror attack. What do you
[02:57:25.200 --> 02:57:31.520]  think they're going to pull the Republicans and Democrats to divert us? I think there's something
[02:57:31.520 --> 02:57:38.960]  they're going to be something big with race. A lot of the racial tension in this country,
[02:57:38.960 --> 02:57:44.160]  I think they're trying to build off that distraction, you know, so people won't
[02:57:44.160 --> 02:57:49.360]  realize the big elephant in the room, which is still the high gas prices. I mean, it only comes
[02:57:49.360 --> 02:57:54.080]  down in certain places. The food that's going to be out of reach, what they're gearing up for
[02:57:54.080 --> 02:58:04.320]  is really something big. And I really want to hear from somebody who's been dealing with this
[02:58:04.320 --> 02:58:10.240]  like political funk for the last couple of years, because Clinton, going out of office,
[02:58:10.240 --> 02:58:17.920]  he passed a law that you couldn't be a group if you're not sanctioned by the government,
[02:58:17.920 --> 02:58:23.760]  or you couldn't be a militia, or they'll try to find reasons to deem you as terrorists and
[02:58:23.760 --> 02:58:26.480]  different things like that. That's right. You're the best caller of the day. We're going to go
[02:58:26.480 --> 02:58:29.600]  in a little bit overdrive, Nick, a few more. But Michael, please call back again. You're
[02:58:29.600 --> 02:58:34.480]  absolutely on target. All they've got is racial division and other garbage and distract us.
[02:58:34.480 --> 02:58:39.920]  Remember, the Republican leadership helped write Obamacare, Romney endorsed Gruber.
[02:58:40.560 --> 02:58:42.080]  That's why we're in so much trouble.
[02:58:43.920 --> 02:58:45.920]  Stay with us.
[02:58:50.240 --> 02:58:54.800]  Another major health threat. This one in Toledo, Ohio, where everybody in the entire city has
[02:58:54.800 --> 02:58:59.200]  been told not to drink the water. Ohio's governor declaring a state of emergency.
[02:58:59.200 --> 02:59:06.160]  Did you know that the average person uses about 80 to 100 gallons of water at home every single day?
[02:59:06.160 --> 02:59:09.200]  If there's a water emergency, will you be prepared?
[02:59:09.200 --> 02:59:12.240]  Panicked residents forming long lines throughout the day.
[02:59:12.240 --> 02:59:17.120]  We're here at a supermarket in Toledo. You can see the shelves empty where water once was.
[02:59:17.120 --> 02:59:22.880]  To stay safe and healthy during a crisis, you must have access to safe, clean water,
[02:59:22.880 --> 02:59:26.320]  water which will not be available at your local grocery store.
[02:59:26.320 --> 02:59:29.440]  There's a mad dash on right now to stock up on supplies.

[02:59:49.440 --> 02:59:55.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:00:11.840 --> 03:00:17.680]  Six Bayonets. Six Bayonets. We are now entering overdrive with your host,
[03:00:17.680 --> 03:00:24.080]  Alex Jones, broadcasting live from the front lines. Everybody's sick of me saying literally
[03:00:24.080 --> 03:00:28.320]  you are the resistance. Well Time magazine has people tweeting what words they want banned,
[03:00:29.120 --> 03:00:33.200]  which is just an attempt to discuss banning things and literally is one of the top ones.
[03:00:33.840 --> 03:00:40.560]  I'm really, I am literally trying to stop using the word literally and I catch myself
[03:00:40.560 --> 03:00:48.080]  literally realizing that I'm actually using the word actually and literally too much. I get it.
[03:00:48.080 --> 03:00:54.480]  But instead of going uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, I say literally, literally, literally.
[03:00:56.240 --> 03:01:01.200]  Or I say literally when I want to say that I'm not exaggerating or this isn't a figure of speech.
[03:01:02.800 --> 03:01:07.920]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to a few more calls. I'm literally going to them now.
[03:01:07.920 --> 03:01:12.880]  Bill in Texas, you're on the air. Go ahead. What's up there, Alex? Hey, how you doing?
[03:01:12.880 --> 03:01:18.480]  I'm doing good. I want to thank you for saving my life. Alex, your products have really returned
[03:01:18.480 --> 03:01:24.080]  my health to me and I want to thank you for my health back. Well, God bless you sir. What they
[03:01:24.080 --> 03:01:29.360]  do? I mean, what products for those? Well, I was taking some mental health medication that I probably
[03:01:29.360 --> 03:01:34.800]  shouldn't ever have taken in my life because I was under attack, just like people across this
[03:01:34.800 --> 03:01:40.480]  country are under attack and they were not reporting my blood work. And so I had like
[03:01:40.480 --> 03:01:45.840]  pustules under my arms. Cities were hurting bad. I've been to the hospital for a whole year with
[03:01:45.840 --> 03:01:52.720]  backaches and pain and my sides were distended. So I quit taking the medication. I went to
[03:01:52.720 --> 03:01:59.600]  homeopathic remedies. Good job. And I started taking your products and I was able to clean
[03:01:59.600 --> 03:02:04.160]  that out. The inflammation went down in my kidneys. I'm able to urinate now better.
[03:02:04.160 --> 03:02:10.880]  Awesome. My health is returned. I've lost some weight. The sores are all gone. My mind is clearer
[03:02:10.880 --> 03:02:16.160]  and it's thanks to your products and really, we're under attack out here. Oh, we are. I mean,
[03:02:16.160 --> 03:02:20.320]  look, if you don't have iodine, you die. You don't have to be 12. You die and you go into the doctor
[03:02:20.320 --> 03:02:24.320]  and they won't tell you that. I have a medical doctor that actually took my blood and said what
[03:02:24.320 --> 03:02:30.560]  I needed years ago and I'm working with them to get the key things I need. But the good news is
[03:02:30.560 --> 03:02:36.320]  more and more medical doctors are clicking. So it's good news. Yeah, we've got domino effect
[03:02:36.320 --> 03:02:42.880]  happening. You know, the dominoes are rolling down right now. We've got the secret army over there
[03:02:43.520 --> 03:02:49.600]  pretending to be crazy Muslims and chopping off heads and half of them aren't even from that country.
[03:02:49.600 --> 03:02:54.480]  Oh, yeah. So it looks like this is a mercenaries that have been hired and who printed up all that
[03:02:54.480 --> 03:03:00.720]  wonderful stuff for them to wear. And so they're over there creating a distraction. Our army boys
[03:03:00.720 --> 03:03:06.160]  are getting their legs and arms blown off so that we can further, you know, do our science work on
[03:03:06.160 --> 03:03:11.040]  how we're going to one day repair legs and stuff. But they're being blown up while the other guys
[03:03:11.040 --> 03:03:16.960]  are loading drugs onto the aircraft. Also our wonderful African Americans up there in Ferguson
[03:03:16.960 --> 03:03:22.320]  after they go through their traumatic just stressing attack that may happen. And I think
[03:03:22.320 --> 03:03:27.280]  it might just attack as I can't state, you know, you go and you shoot these young hippies and what
[03:03:27.280 --> 03:03:33.920]  happens you increase drug abuse in that area, decrease depression, you increase the need for
[03:03:33.920 --> 03:03:40.640]  psychological, you know, help. And that's the tendency to create dependence through terror.
[03:03:40.640 --> 03:03:44.400]  And that's what we have up there. We have psychological terror going on. I agree. And
[03:03:44.400 --> 03:03:48.960]  even the average compartmentalized cop is not aware of it. You're awesome, sir. So many great
[03:03:48.960 --> 03:03:52.240]  callers. We don't have great callers all day, but great callers here at the end. I wish I could
[03:03:52.240 --> 03:03:57.200]  keep going because I want to talk to Barbara and everybody else briefly. The New York Times says
[03:03:57.200 --> 03:04:03.280]  questions about Sharpton's finances, accompanying his rise in influence. Another FBI guy. And it
[03:04:03.280 --> 03:04:08.960]  turns out he basically doesn't pay taxes. Now they may burn Sharpton now because he's no longer
[03:04:08.960 --> 03:04:15.120]  useful because Obama's going out. See, but no, go after Google, go after Microsoft, go after
[03:04:15.120 --> 03:04:20.560]  General Electric where they don't pay taxes. And I'm not defending Sharpton, but see how they'll
[03:04:20.560 --> 03:04:23.840]  burn their people when they're done with them. Man, I tell you, I wouldn't want to be with a
[03:04:23.840 --> 03:04:30.160]  New World Order. Barbara, Daniel, Bob and Rick, I'm sorry I'm out of time. I got a long way to go
[03:04:30.160 --> 03:04:34.560]  in a short time to get there. A lot of work to do, a lot getting ready for coverage tonight of
[03:04:34.560 --> 03:04:38.560]  whatever happens in Ferguson today or tomorrow. We're going to be here covering it. I'm Alex
[03:04:38.560 --> 03:04:44.560]  Jones, your host, infowars.com, prisonplanet.tv. Want to thank our sponsors, our affiliates,
[03:04:44.560 --> 03:04:49.200]  you the listeners, the good Lord, everybody else. Let's pray for peace in Ferguson and other areas
[03:04:49.920 --> 03:04:53.440]  because it's the First Amendment under attack and they want to just play everybody off against
[03:04:53.440 --> 03:05:17.360]  each other. We need to come together and say no to looting and also no to police brutality.
