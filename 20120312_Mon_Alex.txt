[00:42.520 --> 00:49.600]  director TV host filmmaker in his own right of course his father's Oliver Stone who recently
[00:49.600 --> 00:57.800]  converted to Shia Islam in Iran is going to be joining us he's been over there a lot people say
[00:57.800 --> 01:02.560]  is this a stunt now last time I saw him in person he was showing me a little sort of Ali around
[01:02.560 --> 01:06.360]  his neck and saying he was thinking about converting and I said are you serious and he
[01:06.360 --> 01:10.000]  said yes but that's not the main reason he's going to be on with us I'm going to get his
[01:10.000 --> 01:14.800]  view on what's happening in the world what he's seen in Iran and give you a first look on the
[01:14.800 --> 01:19.800]  upcoming season of conspiracy theory with Jesse Ventura Tyrell Ventura and Shawn Stone they're

[01:25.160 --> 01:35.960]  of reality TV and it is reality TV and ever since the word we're going to obviously cover a story
[01:35.960 --> 01:41.760]  that I'm glad got a lot of attention but I didn't really think it would it's probably getting a
[01:41.760 --> 01:45.760]  lot of attention because yesterday it was top featured on the drudge report it's still up there
[01:45.760 --> 01:57.800]  today arrest Angelina Jolie for war crimes Coney 2012 is the name of the video and I've written
[01:57.800 --> 02:04.760]  an article that accompanies it and people are like really arrest her yeah she's an envoy to the UN
[02:04.760 --> 02:12.320]  she's she's she pushed as a propagandist the Libya attack she pushed as a propagandist the Syrian
[02:12.320 --> 02:19.080]  attack that's going on she pushes all of these wars and says you know invade Uganda to go after
[02:19.080 --> 02:25.640]  Coney when he hasn't been seen in years and it is a tiny warlord when the dictator for 26 years of
[02:25.640 --> 02:32.000]  Uganda Western back has killed millions and millions and millions and millions and millions and
[02:32.000 --> 02:38.000]  millions and millions of people some estimates are as high as 7 mil and I've got mainstream articles
[02:38.000 --> 02:43.800]  where the UN is in there slaughtering people for their land killing wounded knees are happening
[02:43.800 --> 02:50.400]  every day and she's there running around at galas and TV and events she's she's lobbying to even be
[02:50.400 --> 02:57.920]  the head envoy for refugees and everybody knows who studied at the UN uses refugee camps to kidnap
[02:57.920 --> 03:03.920]  women children or the rape gangs and to slaughter people in the camps they did that in Rwanda
[03:03.920 --> 03:10.520]  upwards of a million people the UN is the most murderous criminal force ever and that's why
[03:10.520 --> 03:14.640]  there's all this propaganda about UNICEF and the children give your money to it and oh my
[03:14.640 --> 03:20.720]  god little puppy dogs it it wants to take good care of you the United Nations cares about the
[03:20.720 --> 03:27.440]  children the children and so if she isn't consciously evil and I've studied her for a while
[03:27.440 --> 03:33.680]  I've held my tongue for a long time then she's a total moron and she's publicly served and put
[03:33.680 --> 03:39.640]  on notice I mean I'm calling this whole hoax about the UN being this loving good organization
[03:39.640 --> 03:43.840]  that oopsie screwed up here and killed a bunch of people or oopsie screwed up there and killed a
[03:43.840 --> 03:51.280]  bunch of people it is a criminal genocide eugenics organization set up by the Rockefellers to carry
[03:51.280 --> 03:56.320]  out extermination it's their official policy is the United Nations biological diversity assessments
[03:56.320 --> 04:03.120]  it's agenda 21 it's the whole thing it's the army for global government NATO is a big contingent of
[04:03.120 --> 04:08.520]  this system global government openly being run and I'm supposed to sit here and go oh the UN
[04:08.520 --> 04:14.640]  they care so much global peace the UN is there to demonize sovereign countries that have done
[04:14.640 --> 04:19.880]  nothing and give support towards bombing and destroying those countries now finally members
[04:19.880 --> 04:25.840]  of the Security Council said no to an open Syria bombardment and so now the globalists are saying
[04:25.840 --> 04:33.280]  well we just won't get you an authorization them because the rest of the UN is just a debating
[04:33.280 --> 04:38.400]  club but the Security Council actually has the power so I'm not even saying the UN someday
[04:38.400 --> 04:44.880]  couldn't do some good the point is it won't do any good if you don't openly call it out for the
[04:44.880 --> 04:50.120]  criminal organization it is and I'm not saying we need a UN or that I like the UN I'm saying there
[04:50.120 --> 04:54.360]  could be an institution where nations come together for peace and discussion but the UN
[04:54.360 --> 04:59.120]  isn't it it is a eugenics murdering organization that's killed more people than Hitler

[09:09.760 --> 09:18.000]  situation joining us via video skype coming up for part of the third hour today and we will have
[09:18.000 --> 09:24.720]  opened phones throughout the broadcast there's a lot of really important news there has been a media
[09:24.720 --> 09:31.360]  blackout on the fact that since last wednesday impeachment resolution has been introduced in
[09:31.360 --> 09:38.080]  the house and the senate i've been hammering it since then the drudge report has covered it
[09:38.080 --> 09:43.600]  last week and again last night that's the only other media outlet other than info wars but now
[09:43.600 --> 09:50.880]  world net daily has gotten on it and just put out a new article last night so good job there
[09:50.880 --> 09:56.400]  obama impeachment bill now in congress declares president's use of military power
[09:56.400 --> 10:04.000]  approval high crime misdemeanor so a big victory back when clinton impeachment began against clinton
[10:04.000 --> 10:09.040]  it was the number one story for months the the controlled globalist corporate whore press
[10:10.240 --> 10:17.120]  has done everything they can to sell out to the globalist and to cover this up but now
[10:17.120 --> 10:23.440]  the blockade is getting blown wide open curt nemo just got another article up at info wars.com
[10:23.440 --> 10:29.360]  with a video report i shot on that resolution threatens obama impeachment us military action
[10:29.360 --> 10:34.560]  against syria without congressional authorization violates the constitution
[10:38.000 --> 10:49.360]  and so we're going to be going over all of that today and it violates of course more than just
[10:49.360 --> 10:55.040]  that it specifically violates article one section eight clause 11
[10:59.520 --> 11:06.640]  again it violates article one section eight clause 11 for anybody that wants to go
[11:07.520 --> 11:15.520]  looked at up for themselves it also violates other areas of the constitution and we have links
[11:15.520 --> 11:23.360]  to that legislation as well in the article so some very good news on that front
[11:26.560 --> 11:32.480]  also scientists warn epa over monsanto's gmo crop failures and dangers we have an important
[11:32.480 --> 11:37.520]  report on that front there's been a lot of talk about this over the last few months but now zero
[11:37.520 --> 11:42.160]  hedge is reporting on it because the aircraft carrier is being sent there aircraft carrier
[11:42.160 --> 11:48.640]  enterprise sets off on final journey direction iran and wouldn't it be convenient the globalist
[11:48.640 --> 11:54.000]  love to blow up ships that are about to be decommissioned or towers that are rotting with asbestos
[11:54.000 --> 11:57.840]  and then blaming on enemies we know that cy hearse pulled a surprise winner a year after
[11:57.840 --> 12:02.560]  shaney left office could talk about it then and said his sources confirmed to him the
[12:02.560 --> 12:08.400]  yorker magazine reported on this that shaney ordered the navy to have craft painted up like
[12:08.400 --> 12:14.000]  iranian patrol boats and have navy seals attack us destroyers the trade of horn mousse admiral
[12:14.000 --> 12:19.200]  fox fowl and then head of scent com refused talked bad about shaney and then was fired
[12:19.760 --> 12:26.480]  but now we know why so today at noon eastern that's right now it's being launched the story
[12:26.480 --> 12:35.520]  to aircraft carrier enterprise aka cvn 65 left its home port of naval station novak virginia

[12:56.640 --> 13:02.080]  persian gulf region as a reminder back in january we learned that the enterprise's final voyage
[13:02.080 --> 13:06.960]  will be in proximity to iran and in the meantime the aircraft carrier held extensive drills
[13:06.960 --> 13:17.360]  off the florida coast to attack a fake theocracy so a artificial theocracy in the drill aka iran
[13:17.360 --> 13:25.760]  consisting of fundamentalist shahada made up name states why the arabian sea is about seven
[13:25.760 --> 13:32.400]  ten to days will be home to not two but three aircraft carriers and a big deck amphibious
[13:32.400 --> 13:40.560]  warfare ship is very much an open question although we may have some thoughts yeah no kidding

[15:55.840 --> 16:00.240]  say well just do the body scanner we won't rope you every time i've flown and watch people stand
[16:00.240 --> 16:06.320]  and over and over again almost everyone i've seen go through the scanner is then directed
[16:06.320 --> 16:15.760]  over for a grub down well now i was talking to patrick henison and he says that they've
[16:15.760 --> 16:19.440]  got more video but they're back they're downloading and i saw it right before i went on air that
[16:20.480 --> 16:26.800]  this guy's got two artificial legs and they're asking him what they are and saying take them off
[16:26.800 --> 16:32.080]  and stuff and the guy's like i these are my artificial legs and they're barking at them and
[16:32.080 --> 16:37.680]  everything else i mean it and you're like but that's horrible it's about being horrible it's
[16:37.680 --> 16:50.080]  about humiliation it's about seeing what you will take it's about seeing what you will put up with
[16:50.080 --> 17:01.360]  with continuing 1960s slums of chicago uses laboratory by rockefeller's population council
[17:01.360 --> 17:05.760]  another big article about that testing things on people go read it
[17:09.040 --> 17:15.760]  ron paul wins first caucus msm changes rules reports romney wins yeah i guess they couldn't
[17:15.760 --> 17:22.000]  steal it in that state they stole it in iowa main nevada south carolina and then by then
[17:22.000 --> 17:25.920]  people started thinking well he can't win and then they haven't had to engage in much fraud
[17:25.920 --> 17:30.240]  because people say i was going to vote for ron paul but you know he didn't make it like i thought
[17:30.800 --> 17:34.400]  and i even saw some of his own staff quoted by politica some of the younger folks that
[17:34.400 --> 17:38.480]  worked for him going in the presidential campaign going oh my gosh
[17:38.480 --> 17:47.200]  oh my gosh um we just don't understand why he wins in polls and straw polls but isn't here
[17:47.200 --> 17:52.080]  we're mystified you're mystified there's open fraud going on ron paul's even said it
[17:54.800 --> 18:00.960]  i remember whenever wane paul was on the air and um a few months ago there was fraud in iowa
[18:02.160 --> 18:05.920]  there was fraud two days before that republican operative said don't worry he's not going to
[18:05.920 --> 18:11.120]  win we're going to fix it and so we sent that video to high level folks in the paul campaign
[18:11.120 --> 18:15.360]  and then i saw the email back going nothing to this nothing to worry about really there was nothing
[18:15.360 --> 18:21.360]  to worry about there in iowa and again i'm not attacking anybody i just let's all stop being
[18:21.360 --> 18:27.040]  naive not trusting a government that's been caught engaging in election fraud over and over again
[18:27.040 --> 18:31.840]  and being honest about it is the only way we're ever going to wake up as a country and change
[18:31.840 --> 18:36.960]  the electronic voting machines and the fraud but in the case of the caucuses he openly won
[18:36.960 --> 18:41.920]  and they said on fox news well a bunch of trucks got lost with the ballots after the
[18:41.920 --> 18:47.120]  caucuses voted in iowa folks there are no trucks they vote they post from the wall they telephone
[18:47.120 --> 18:53.920]  it in it was all the counties like where aims is based that are colleges where he had double
[18:53.920 --> 18:59.440]  digit in some cases 52 percent leads and i mean in some areas he had 52 percent of the vote
[18:59.440 --> 19:10.400]  just didn't get counted do you understand that that's on record and the campaign didn't do anything
[19:10.400 --> 19:14.640]  about that they finally did by main even the new york times said yeah he really won main but
[19:14.640 --> 19:17.280]  and the republican leadership said it doesn't matter we're not counting we're giving it to
[19:17.280 --> 19:23.920]  romney show ron paul was the frontrunner and has been cheated now people don't want to wake up and
[19:23.920 --> 19:27.840]  admit that that's their problem but the american people people like well that's a negative view
[19:27.840 --> 19:32.240]  it's not a negative view of its reality you're like well then why'd you say run ron paul because

[24:08.880 --> 24:25.520]  i made the point
[24:28.640 --> 24:33.840]  on yesterday's sunday transmission that the globalists are now moving on every front they're
[24:33.840 --> 24:39.680]  invading scores of nations through proxy wars through rebels publicly funded by nature the
[24:39.680 --> 24:47.840]  united states uh england france the un they are involved in massacres all over the world
[24:50.560 --> 24:55.680]  they are openly announcing in every major financial publication from the economist
[24:55.680 --> 25:04.880]  to forbes to newsweek and time that world government is here run by private banks obama
[25:04.880 --> 25:09.360]  friday signed the bill giving people felony charges for protesting anywhere the feds are

[25:43.760 --> 25:51.120]  obama worse than bush you bet but because he has left cover the so-called trendy left is in a coma
[25:51.120 --> 26:01.280]  now it isn't our top story because angelina joe lee is a poster girl for the un it's not our top
[26:01.280 --> 26:06.720]  story because i shot a video about it and it's now in dozens and dozens of newspapers thousands of
[26:06.720 --> 26:13.200]  blogs and was the top story on the drudge report it's our top story because through the window
[26:13.200 --> 26:22.560]  of angelina joe lee we can really see the propaganda war the psi op of the un and their global eugenics
[26:22.560 --> 26:31.280]  extermination operation that they publicly carry out everywhere as you know five six days ago when
[26:31.280 --> 26:38.640]  koni 2012 a government connected bill gates connected funded propaganda piece came out
[26:38.640 --> 26:46.080]  basically pushing for military invasion of uganda by the us un nato and others and by the way they're
[26:46.080 --> 26:56.160]  already there carrying out different operations it's a film that was just put out to brand some
[26:56.160 --> 27:01.200]  boogie man who's probably been dead he hadn't been seen over five years and who has a tiny area that
[27:01.200 --> 27:10.480]  his people still control a few hundred square miles in the north of uganda and they put out a video
[27:10.480 --> 27:15.040]  basically calling for an invasion and let's get koni and it makes the un international criminal
[27:15.040 --> 27:21.520]  court look like rock stars and that they're great people who want to help everybody it's just shallow
[27:21.520 --> 27:27.280]  propaganda designed for an american population on average that can't even find africa on a map
[27:27.280 --> 27:31.760]  and the average america to national polls you can pull this up thinks africa is a country
[27:33.440 --> 27:36.800]  i saw that number last year something like 54 percent think it's a country
[27:39.040 --> 27:46.080]  it's a continent south america is a continent north america is a continent asia is a continent
[27:46.080 --> 27:49.360]  europe's a continent australia is a continent
[27:49.360 --> 27:59.120]  and arctica is a continent they're not countries and i know my audience who's informed is like
[27:59.120 --> 28:03.840]  yalex we know that listen you wonder why the general public's so easy to control they don't
[28:03.840 --> 28:12.000]  know that africa is a bunch of countries inside of a continent they think the entire continent
[28:12.000 --> 28:20.880]  is a country and that's why they can have this invincible ignorance i mean more and more the
[28:20.880 --> 28:26.480]  propaganda we face as joseph gerbil said is just really simple and mindless and so stupid and so
[28:26.480 --> 28:31.440]  false it's like a tar baby how do you even deal with it i mean i've got stacks of confirmed even
[28:31.440 --> 28:36.480]  mainstream articles where the un is all over africa just murdering and slaughtering and
[28:36.480 --> 28:42.640]  raping and killing and burning down villages and taking people's property and running off these poor
[28:42.640 --> 28:46.800]  little tribes that are there living happily you know in the fields and in the jungles growing
[28:46.800 --> 28:53.680]  their own crops forcing them into the cities to work as slave labor injecting them with all sorts
[28:53.680 --> 29:00.320]  of you know un sponsored vaccines that in some countries half the women have hiv they've done
[29:00.320 --> 29:07.040]  even a bbc study a decade ago saying we checked the women's hymen and almost all of them have never
[29:07.040 --> 29:12.480]  even had sexual intercourse and lived in villages and had never been touched why do they have hiv
[29:12.480 --> 29:20.480]  they'd all had vaccines and the bbc said oh they must be using dirty needles at the un no you you
[29:20.480 --> 29:27.840]  don't get hiv that easy they're shooting them up with it it is a bio weapon that's on record the

[31:58.320 --> 32:04.960]  don't a little over a year ago i began to do a lot of research into why even if i had a pretty
[32:04.960 --> 32:10.480]  good size meal that i was still starving and my research led me to a well-known fact that most of
[32:10.480 --> 32:15.040]  the soils that we grow our crops on here in the united states and across the industrialized world
[32:15.040 --> 32:20.800]  are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our
[32:20.800 --> 32:27.680]  bodies need to rebuild themselves fight off cancer and be healthy i then searched out the best vitamin

[33:27.680 --> 33:38.880]  but
[33:49.040 --> 33:51.280]  here's the cry of war
[33:51.280 --> 34:02.280]  Louder than before. With this sword in hand, you control the land.
[34:02.280 --> 34:07.280]  Wasn't that song written by Dave Mustaine? The Phantom Lord?
[34:07.280 --> 34:09.280]  Frank it up.
[34:09.280 --> 34:24.280]  This is the Metallica I like right here. The Joe Lee comes in peace.
[34:24.280 --> 34:33.280]  With this sword in hand, you control the land.
[34:33.280 --> 34:40.280]  And who is Joe Lee? I've looked in her eyes. She burns with the power trip.
[34:40.280 --> 34:44.280]  With the enjoyment of parading around. It's like Team America.
[34:44.280 --> 34:48.280]  But they're like, we need an actor, Gary.
[34:48.280 --> 34:54.280]  That's exactly what's going on here. And I can make jokes about it.
[34:54.280 --> 34:59.280]  But it's very, very serious. I mean, I was in the last five days doing more research on Coney 2012.
[34:59.280 --> 35:07.280]  Because I knew up front it was a UN pro-war, pro-invasion, pro-world government, international criminal court, arresting whoever they want.
[35:07.280 --> 35:14.280]  All these Supreme Court justices saying, we're now going to take the precedent of the UN, who says you have no right to own firearms, anything.
[35:14.280 --> 35:25.280]  And adopt that as our law. And now our Congress last Tuesday, now seven days ago, was told by the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Chairman and the SEC,
[35:25.280 --> 35:31.280]  Secretary of Defense, we take orders from the UN and NACO, not from Congress.
[35:31.280 --> 35:38.280]  And the Senator kept saying, we have the war powers article one, Section 8, Clause 11.
[35:38.280 --> 35:44.280]  And they said, nope. And the Senator's session said, I'm almost breathless.
[35:44.280 --> 35:49.280]  And the senators were all looking around because this is treason.
[35:49.280 --> 35:58.280]  And you've got Angelina Jo Lee. I mean, I refreshed my memory on her because I've always thought that she looks like a dead carp or something.
[35:58.280 --> 36:02.280]  And I'm not trying to talk about a woman looks, but she just does not fancy me as that beautiful.
[36:02.280 --> 36:08.280]  Snake like, she could play a vampire in movies. I'm just not into ringwraith looking women.
[36:08.280 --> 36:12.280]  But that's a side, I know she's really vain. And I know she's watching and I know she's listening.
[36:12.280 --> 36:31.280]  And so my hatred of you for hurting the children and doing it in the name of humanitarianism is so bad that I do try to hurt your, your worldly vain countenance.
[36:31.280 --> 36:41.280]  And I'm being worldly there. I should just be strong and resist you. It's just that you make me want to throw up now continuing.
[36:41.280 --> 36:47.280]  And even though she's a mid-level minion at the UN, she is a key propagandist.
[36:47.280 --> 37:00.280]  And so I already knew all this about her. But before I attacked somebody, I was doing just hours and hours of Coney 2012 research confirming Rockefeller's State Department involved in it, funding it in it,
[37:00.280 --> 37:05.280]  pushing for invasions, pushing for African. That's where all this was going.
[37:05.280 --> 37:12.280]  They launched the film last week. It's 100 million views, just on one platform alone, probably 200 million total in different venues.
[37:12.280 --> 37:19.280]  It's all over every news channel, establishment media, promoting it everywhere, how great it is. Coney's the devil.
[37:19.280 --> 37:25.280]  He's just like Hitler and bin Laden. They actually said that on the news, showed images of Hitler faded into Coney.
[37:25.280 --> 37:33.280]  I saw that across TV networks, across newspaper graphics. I mean, it was a unified propaganda push to invade Africa.
[37:33.280 --> 37:38.280]  And they said, Coney 2012, one thing we all agree on, you know, basically invade Uganda.
[37:38.280 --> 37:44.280]  So I went and refreshed myself. I got professors on that have been there. I got journalists on who've been there.
[37:44.280 --> 37:48.280]  I went and did research and I sometimes kind of get obsessed on a particular topic.
[37:48.280 --> 38:00.280]  So I probably did five, six, seven hours of research per day after last Wednesday when Richard Reeves brought this to my attention.
[38:00.280 --> 38:11.280]  And I began to refresh myself on that in Uganda, the dictator of Uganda that the West backs, they don't call the dictator,
[38:11.280 --> 38:18.280]  has been involved in the deaths of seven million people conservatively in his country and surrounding nations.
[38:18.280 --> 38:26.280]  I mean, just a Western killing machine where they just wipe out whole groups who are on diamonds, gold, rare earth, minerals, oil.
[38:26.280 --> 38:35.280]  Coney, certainly, you know, a bad guy, but you've got all these homeless kids and people, gives them weapons, feeds them, you know, uses them basically as cannon fodder.
[38:35.280 --> 38:41.280]  But he's a tiny little warlord. He's just some bad guy to then prop up the Ugandan dictator.
[38:41.280 --> 38:49.280]  And I found out the UN has launched in the last year a new offensive, just slaughtering people everywhere with global corporations for their land.
[38:49.280 --> 38:56.280]  I mean, it's in the New York Times. And for you in carbon taxes, Paul Watson has links to all this in the articles he's written about it.
[38:56.280 --> 39:07.280]  So does Kurt Nemo. So all of this is going on. All of this is happening. And so I start researching it.
[39:07.280 --> 39:13.280]  And it just brought back to mind that Stalin said one man dies, it's a tragedy, 10,000 dies are statistic.
[39:13.280 --> 39:20.280]  And I was just refreshing my shelf, my memory on what's going on in Africa.
[39:20.280 --> 39:28.280]  And I mean, it is a genocide. You can speculate all day about the tetanus shots they give them that sterilize them in the UN got caught or giving them HIV.
[39:28.280 --> 39:38.280]  People can try to deny that. You know, the proof's there. The fact that the UN goes in backed by mercenaries and burns down villages and just mows people down.
[39:38.280 --> 39:44.280]  And just all over Africa, there's just piles of skeletons everywhere.
[39:44.280 --> 39:54.280]  And then you've got at the clothing stores at the mall and on TV and I see women's bags, especially attractive women for some reason will be uniceft.
[39:54.280 --> 40:02.280]  And it's they give women to feed the kids. Yeah, you mean have a PR stunt where it shows them feeding them all over the mountain, the mercenaries are lining them up and shooting them.
[40:02.280 --> 40:10.280]  I mean, it's like don't run. We're your friends. We come in peace and Mars attacks and they're shooting everybody. I mean, it is just incredible.
[40:10.280 --> 40:23.280]  And so then I got mad and I said, wait a minute, I know Joe leaves a UN envoy. I know she pushes all this refugee stuff, which the UN uses for extermination operations to round folks up and starve them to death or let the neighboring tribe come in and kill them in the case of Rwanda.
[40:23.280 --> 40:30.280]  Or sometimes they just machine gun everybody. They sex slave them. There's photos and videos of them roasting kids over fires, the UN.
[40:30.280 --> 40:37.280]  I mean, you want to rape and murder and kill? Go join the UN Army. I mean, there's nothing like it.
[40:37.280 --> 40:42.280]  It is an army of Genghis Khan's military was not this wicked.
[40:42.280 --> 40:49.280]  I mean, it's well known that if you're a pedophile pervert, rapist criminal, you go join the UN because you've got diplomatic immunity.
[40:49.280 --> 40:55.280]  None of these other countries have immunity. The UN, because it's the global bankers army, they have diplomatic immunity.
[40:55.280 --> 41:03.280]  That's why they always get caught different UN diplomats with sex slaves and killing kids and all this because it's just an army of darkness.
[41:03.280 --> 41:09.280]  With a bunch of propaganda telling you that it loves you and cares about you and, you know, give money.
[41:09.280 --> 41:18.280]  I mean, I grew up. Even at the church we went to one time, we raised money for UNICEF selling cookies.
[41:18.280 --> 41:27.280]  I had friends that would go out at, you know, at kids and not get money at Christmas for the Salvation Army, but for the UN.
[41:27.280 --> 41:32.280]  I mean, I have worked to give the UN money when I was a little kid just a few times.
[41:32.280 --> 41:40.280]  This is the type of stuff that goes on how they use well-meaning people and then they use somebody like Angelina Joe Lee with her horrible history.
[41:40.280 --> 41:44.280]  Go look into it. Not just breaking up families, but the snatch in people's kids.
[41:44.280 --> 41:52.280]  She's just like Madonna and then watching her and all these Illuminati movies she's into and just getting off.
[41:52.280 --> 42:03.280]  She's doing awards ceremonies every night. A narcissistic, empty husk for demonic entities to live in, pun intended.
[42:03.280 --> 42:10.280]  So all of this is going on and I for one am sick of it. I'm calling the hoax that is the UN.
[42:10.280 --> 42:15.280]  I'm calling it out. I'm done. I'm done playing games with these people.
[42:15.280 --> 42:19.280]  You notice I'm turning the heat up. It's like I said a few months ago in those promos we run.
[42:19.280 --> 42:23.280]  Okay, the Info War now goes to the next level. I'm not here to play games with these people.
[42:23.280 --> 42:27.280]  I'm here to break their hoax and it's so close to breaking.
[42:27.280 --> 42:32.280]  This Coney 2012 thing over 100 million views on one video alone has totally blown up.
[42:32.280 --> 42:42.280]  Now the negative comments have gone five to one. The negative votes against it have reversed and are going more than five to one when they were almost completely positive just four or five days ago.
[42:42.280 --> 42:50.280]  There are thousands of videos against it, including Ugandans saying, are you kidding? Coney hadn't been seen in five, six years.
[42:50.280 --> 42:56.280]  He was a tiny warlord. The president here is murdering everybody.
[42:56.280 --> 43:08.280]  The UN is killing people. So I see her as this UN envoy who's always pushing Libya wars, Syria invasions, all of it.
[43:08.280 --> 43:15.280]  Giving it left cover, being lauded as this wonderful humanitarian who cares about everybody.
[43:15.280 --> 43:22.280]  And I've had enough. I've had enough. People are like, wow, yeah, I agree the UN's killing people, but wow, a raster? Absolutely.
[43:22.280 --> 43:33.280]  I'm not saying a raster for thought crimes, but if you're a UN envoy calling for the government to continue to crack down on the population in the name of getting some boogeyman,
[43:33.280 --> 43:38.280]  when there's a major globalist offensive to clean people off the land in Uganda and surrounding areas,
[43:38.280 --> 43:47.280]  and this is all a big PR stunt for the murderous UN and its kangaroo ICC where they grab people and they almost always die in their jail before the kangaroo trial.
[43:47.280 --> 43:54.280]  When you're pushing a criminal, genocidal, world government instrument and you are a top envoy now, not just spokeswoman.
[43:54.280 --> 44:04.280]  You're not like Shirley Temple, you know, promoting the Department of War. You are a globalist snake.
[44:04.280 --> 44:16.280]  And so, yes, I can use her celebrity that they use to push their evil and like judo boomerang it back on them and say arrest Angelina Joe Lee for war crimes.
[44:16.280 --> 44:31.280]  And the video is going to be seen millions of times. I can already tell you that if it says it's been seen 170,000 times and I just put it up there yesterday afternoon,
[44:31.280 --> 44:40.280]  that it takes time for those number counts to basically build up and it'll end up getting seen two, three million times unless YouTube blocks it.
[44:40.280 --> 44:52.280]  And people are like, well, your show has 3 million listeners today, 15 million a week. Why do you care so much about this? This is reaching all the mainline, dumbbell, dumb down, ignorant young people that have been bamboozled by Coney 2012.
[44:52.280 --> 45:00.280]  And this is going directly to Joe Lee and it's going to create a snowball of not just exposing her, but the entire UN system.
[45:00.280 --> 45:07.280]  Now, there's a small chance Joe Lee is just a useful idiot and really thinks she's helping people.
[45:07.280 --> 45:16.280]  And so if my calling for her arrest, but I go on to call for the leadership's arrest, Ban Ki-moon, the big mega corporations.
[45:16.280 --> 45:25.280]  I want the arrest of coffee annan and by the way, that's been called for in mainstream media and by major courts for all the oil for food and starving people for money and being paid off.
[45:25.280 --> 45:33.280]  I mean, it's an unusually corrupt group because of the diplomatic immunity.
[45:33.280 --> 45:38.280]  You give somebody diplomatic immunity, license to kill, steal. What do you think is going to happen?
[45:38.280 --> 45:45.280]  And so I want this woman to know, we know who she is as the spokesman for this. I'm going after their spokesman.
[45:45.280 --> 45:58.280]  It's like them trying to sell cigarettes to kids with Joe Camel. Kids, Joe Camel wants to kill you. Joe Camel isn't even real, but I'm saying it in a language everybody can understand.
[45:58.280 --> 46:05.280]  Well, Angelina Jolie Israel makes all these pro-aluminati movies, all these pro-police state movies.
[46:05.280 --> 46:14.280]  She's got a movie out promoting UN invasion and attack on Serbia, which again, both sides were killing each other in that.
[46:14.280 --> 46:23.280]  But the Croats, the Muslims and others statistically in the UN admits this killed two to one Serbs.
[46:23.280 --> 46:29.280]  Both sides, ethnic warfare, horrible. I'm not a Serb. I'm not a Croat. I'm not a Muslim. I don't have a dog in the fight.
[46:29.280 --> 46:33.280]  I went and actually researched what happened.
[46:33.280 --> 46:39.280]  And outside of mainstream television, the UN even admits what happened, two to one.
[46:39.280 --> 46:51.280]  But they wanted to destroy Serbia and give southern Serbia the equivalent of third of the US in comparison to Albania, which is run by a bunch of Al-Qaeda terrorists to ship heroin through it.
[46:51.280 --> 47:01.280]  And they run in the sex trade. They've been ethically cleansing Serbs that are left in Kosovo ever since then.
[47:01.280 --> 47:08.280]  Oh really? So she's filming a movie now where she plays the mistress of all evil.
[47:08.280 --> 47:13.280]  She's playing the evil witch from Sleeping Beauty. Very interesting. Well, I mean, there you go. I've looked in her eyes.
[47:13.280 --> 47:17.280]  I've seen how she operates. She is an incredibly wicked person.
[47:17.280 --> 47:23.280]  My gut, my instincts, and her entire history show she wants to run for president later.
[47:23.280 --> 47:29.280]  She wants to be the head of the IMF or World Bank later. She's very hungry for this. She's enjoying it.
[47:29.280 --> 47:37.280]  She enjoys these dark roles because she's a very dark person. Very small chance she's a useful idiot.
[47:37.280 --> 47:50.280]  And so I'm here. You want to be the champion for African invasion of Africa? Well, I'll stand up and try to get the people to rally so we can all be the champions of everybody being downtrodden by the globalist boot.
[47:50.280 --> 47:56.280]  And everything you see being done in Africa, Gen 21, shutting off their resources, it's happening here.
[47:56.280 --> 48:04.280]  The GMO attack, it's happening here as it is in Africa. Everybody's under attack by this new world order. Everybody.
[48:04.280 --> 48:09.280]  And that's why they put Obama in for the left cover. Give him the peace prize. So all of his new wars are peace.
[48:09.280 --> 48:17.280]  The UN invades. It uses NATO to do it. The UN gives the authorization. The UN has its own armies. They attack your country.
[48:17.280 --> 48:22.280]  They murder you. They take your land. And Angelina Jolie walks around and says, we're good.
[48:22.280 --> 48:27.280]  We're fighting somebody who hadn't been seen in almost six years, who controlled a tiny area.
[48:27.280 --> 48:35.280]  It's just some simple boogeyman for the American people that can't even find Africa on a map and think that it's a country, not a continent.
[48:35.280 --> 48:40.280]  Okay? It's a hoax. And this is my statement on her.
[48:40.280 --> 48:47.280]  Arrest Angelina Jolie for war crimes. Coney 2012 is the name of the article and it's got the videos. In fact, a new one I shot.
[48:47.280 --> 48:51.280]  Clearly, there are bigger criminals in the United Nations. This is my statement.
[48:51.280 --> 48:57.280]  But nevertheless, she has been an enthusiastic proponent of all these so-called humanitarian wars.
[48:57.280 --> 49:00.280]  War is peace, folks. You heard of that before?
[49:00.280 --> 49:05.280]  In Libya and beyond, the United Nations history of war crimes and massacres is legendary.
[49:05.280 --> 49:07.280]  We have a link to a big index of those.
[49:07.280 --> 49:12.280]  And just as Joseph Goebbels operated as a propaganda minister for the Nazis,
[49:12.280 --> 49:19.280]  Jolie, who is officially employed by the UN as an envoy, is their mouthpiece.
[49:19.280 --> 49:22.280]  It is her task to promote endless war.
[49:22.280 --> 49:29.280]  It's time to call out the United Nations by extension their poster girl, Jolie, for what they are.
[49:29.280 --> 49:32.280]  Instruments of a corporate fascist world government.
[49:32.280 --> 49:42.280]  Yesterday morning while doing research into Coney 2012, I read a Hollywood reporter article where Jolie was enthusiastically calling for an invasion to arrest Joseph Coney.
[49:42.280 --> 49:45.280]  That's just a cover for an invasion in Uganda.
[49:45.280 --> 49:51.280]  And the hypocrisy was just too much. And I did some more research on her and confirmed she's even worse than I thought.
[49:51.280 --> 49:56.280]  The western back dictator of Uganda has overseen the murder, we have links to that,
[49:56.280 --> 50:01.280]  of a thousand times the number of people than what Joseph Coney has killed.
[50:01.280 --> 50:06.280]  And so by Angelina Jolie's benchmark for war crimes, she herself should be arrested.
[50:06.280 --> 50:14.280]  But therein lies the paradox, because the United Nations would have to arrest itself and its own minions.
[50:14.280 --> 50:21.280]  I mean, it's such a hoax, but only because of your willful ignorance, America and world,
[50:21.280 --> 50:30.280]  can you have a horrible demonic front person like her pushing all these wars, wrecking Libya, mass death, country and fire, al-Qaeda,
[50:30.280 --> 50:37.280]  women having burkas shoved on their heads, generally mutilated, al-Qaeda swattering blacks by the tens of thousands,
[50:37.280 --> 50:42.280]  total bedlam, total bedlam in Egypt, total bedlam in Syria, total bedlam everywhere,
[50:42.280 --> 50:46.280]  with her hopping around looking like Medusa.
[50:46.280 --> 50:51.280]  I mean, there's a reason she plays witches in Beowulf and everything else.
[50:51.280 --> 51:20.280]  Because she is a witch, she's a globalist, big fat satanic devil, and I see her, and I want humanity to realize she's an enemy.
[51:21.280 --> 51:31.280]  You will wake up people in your area and support our operation as we move to the next level.
[51:31.280 --> 51:34.280]  We need your help to spread the word like never before.
[51:34.280 --> 51:40.280]  They wish to hide themselves during this tectonic battle between the forces of freedom and darkness.
[51:40.280 --> 51:48.280]  You are the response to the globalist technocrats and their program of global eugenics dehumanization
[51:48.280 --> 51:54.280]  and ultimate extermination. The war is here. It's an info war.
[51:54.280 --> 52:00.280]  The spirit of 1776 versus the mindset of 1984.
[52:00.280 --> 52:06.280]  Are you having trouble paying your mortgage? Maybe your mortgage loan is upside down or in foreclosure.
[52:06.280 --> 52:08.280]  Maybe the bank already foreclosed on you.

[52:31.280 --> 52:34.280]  And maybe, like me, you will go after them.
[52:34.280 --> 52:39.280]  Did you know 78% of home loans in the last 10 years violated consumer credit laws?

[54:20.280 --> 54:22.280]  I'd love to hear from you.
[54:22.280 --> 54:26.280]  I want to do what I did yesterday again because there's so many millions of people
[54:26.280 --> 54:28.280]  that can never get involved in the show.

[54:40.280 --> 54:43.280]  800-259-9231.
[54:43.280 --> 54:46.280]  In closing on Angelina Joe Lee,
[54:46.280 --> 54:53.280]  we can really use the energy of this Coney 2012 propaganda that she was using to promote.
[54:53.280 --> 54:56.280]  See they say something's got to be done about Coney and that she comes out,
[54:56.280 --> 55:00.280]  and she's going to be the president of Uganda to help the government fighting.
[55:00.280 --> 55:03.280]  No one has ever even seen him in five, six years.
[55:03.280 --> 55:05.280]  It's just a way to go in and take over resources.
[55:05.280 --> 55:08.280]  And I have links to the UN in our articles,
[55:08.280 --> 55:12.280]  slaughtering and killing people and private companies there
[55:12.280 --> 55:17.280]  for part of UN carbon agreements killing people, pushing them off their land.
[55:17.280 --> 55:19.280]  You know, get off your farm.
[55:19.280 --> 55:23.280]  I've been here since the time before my grandfather's.
[55:23.280 --> 55:25.280]  Well, you're dead.
[55:25.280 --> 55:27.280]  But it doesn't matter because the UN's the good guys
[55:27.280 --> 55:31.280]  because they're fighting some guy named Coney who pretty much doesn't exist like bin Laden.
[55:31.280 --> 55:35.280]  They love phantom boogeyman because they can later just kill some black guy
[55:35.280 --> 55:37.280]  and say that's him on the news.
[55:37.280 --> 55:41.280]  And they may be gearing up for that as some new Psyop like the bin Laden thing.
[55:41.280 --> 55:43.280]  So this is what's going on.
[55:43.280 --> 55:48.280]  And by playing on extreme ignorance, that's how the system gets all of this done.
[55:48.280 --> 55:53.280]  So I want to challenge all of you to go get the videos that we've shot
[55:53.280 --> 55:55.280]  and the articles we've written on this subject
[55:55.280 --> 56:03.280]  and to intensify your operations as well on the issue of impeaching Obama.
[56:03.280 --> 56:08.280]  In fact, let me just go to info wars.com here to give you the actual headline.
[56:08.280 --> 56:13.280]  We've been writing articles about this since last Wednesday.
[56:13.280 --> 56:18.280]  Pentagon announces UN coup over America, articles like that.
[56:18.280 --> 56:22.280]  But we have a article at info wars.com
[56:22.280 --> 56:29.280]  detailing that impeachment against Obama has been introduced
[56:29.280 --> 56:32.280]  with the bill number and the rest of it and it's finally getting picked up
[56:32.280 --> 56:37.280]  by places like World Net Daily, Obama impeachment bill now in Congress.
[56:37.280 --> 56:42.280]  Representative Walter B. Jones of North Carolina has introduced a resolution declaring
[56:42.280 --> 56:45.280]  that should the president use offensive military force without authorization
[56:45.280 --> 56:48.280]  or an act of Congress, it is the sense of the Congress that such an act
[56:48.280 --> 56:50.280]  would be impeachable high crime and misdemeanor.
[56:50.280 --> 56:54.280]  It violates article one section eight clause 11.
[56:54.280 --> 56:57.280]  Again, you're like Alex, you've been covering this since last Wednesday.
[56:57.280 --> 57:01.280]  I know, but World Net Daily is getting around to covering it now.
[57:01.280 --> 57:06.280]  Others are getting around to covering it.
[57:06.280 --> 57:09.280]  And we need to push this over the edge.
[57:09.280 --> 57:14.280]  Look, if he gets away with this, first it had to be a declaration of war.
[57:14.280 --> 57:16.280]  Then they had to authorize it.
[57:16.280 --> 57:18.280]  Then the president had to at least talk to Congress,
[57:18.280 --> 57:20.280]  even though that's still violating the law.
[57:20.280 --> 57:22.280]  And now he says, look, I follow the UN's orders.
[57:22.280 --> 57:24.280]  I mean, let's really let that burn in.
[57:24.280 --> 57:28.280]  That actually is happening now.
[57:28.280 --> 57:31.280]  And you notice Rangelina Jolie wants to be a boss is at the UN
[57:31.280 --> 57:34.280]  because she's been told that's going to be the new boss over this country.
[57:34.280 --> 57:39.280]  That's the new consortium at the big mega banks run.
[57:39.280 --> 57:43.280]  By the way, this is all UN is in a 21 UNESCO garbage.
[57:43.280 --> 57:47.280]  CBS News reporting incoming UC students maybe asked to declare
[57:47.280 --> 57:49.280]  their sexual orientation not allowed to be in college.
[57:49.280 --> 57:53.280]  See, they're going to be the sex police under all this.
[57:53.280 --> 57:57.280]  And then continuing, and if you're heterosexual and have a crime committed against you,
[57:57.280 --> 57:59.280]  you don't get the same protections.
[57:59.280 --> 58:02.280]  Bill introduced to regulate men's reproductive health.
[58:02.280 --> 58:09.280]  Now, if men want to get Viagra or anything else before getting a prescription for Viagra
[58:09.280 --> 58:12.280]  or other erectile dysfunction drugs,
[58:12.280 --> 58:14.280]  men would have to see a sex therapist,
[58:14.280 --> 58:20.280]  receive a cardiac stress test and get notarized affidavits signed by a sexual partner
[58:20.280 --> 58:23.280]  affirming in impotency.
[58:23.280 --> 58:26.280]  This is the kind of laws they're trying to pass.
[58:26.280 --> 58:29.280]  Senate Bill 307.
[58:29.280 --> 58:34.280]  So see, this is the sex police, folks.
[58:34.280 --> 58:37.280]  They want to be involved in every facet of your life.
[58:37.280 --> 58:39.280]  We'll be right back.
[58:39.280 --> 58:47.280]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[58:50.280 --> 58:54.280]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[58:54.280 --> 58:59.280]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[58:59.280 --> 59:05.280]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[59:05.280 --> 59:10.280]  That's true. Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[59:10.280 --> 59:15.280]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[59:15.280 --> 59:19.280]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[59:19.280 --> 59:22.280]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[59:22.280 --> 59:26.280]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[59:26.280 --> 59:31.280]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[59:31.280 --> 59:34.280]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[59:34.280 --> 59:36.280]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[59:36.280 --> 59:40.280]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[59:40.280 --> 59:42.280]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[59:42.280 --> 59:46.280]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[59:46.280 --> 59:50.280]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[59:53.280 --> 59:55.280]  Waging war on corruption.
[59:55.280 --> 01:00:05.280]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.280 --> 01:00:06.280]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.280 --> 01:00:08.280]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.280]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:10.280 --> 01:00:11.280]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:13.280]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.280 --> 01:00:17.280]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:28.280]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:28.280 --> 01:00:30.280]  All right, we are now into hour number two.
[01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:32.280]  We're going to take 20-30 minutes of your calls,
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:35.280]  and Patrick Henningson is going to be joining us in the studio.
[01:00:35.280 --> 01:00:41.280]  He happened to catch some TSA abuse on his way to Austin.
[01:00:41.280 --> 01:00:44.280]  Patrick Henningson, writer for infowars.com.
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:48.280]  I've already covered a bunch of news, but I've got a lot of other important news
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:51.280]  we're going to be getting into coming up.
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:54.280]  Sarkozy threatens to pull France from Europe.
[01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:56.280]  Visa-free zone.
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:59.280]  Germany threatening to leave the Europe.
[01:00:59.280 --> 01:01:02.280]  People are now being arrested with $1 million warrants
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:05.280]  and locked up for weeks for selling raw milk and stuff.
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.280]  I mean, it's getting crazy.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:10.280]  Meanwhile, companies are allowed to sell you pink slime to schoolchildren.
[01:01:10.280 --> 01:01:12.280]  It's very toxic.
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:14.280]  We're not making this up.
[01:01:14.280 --> 01:01:16.280]  We're going to go over all of this coming up.
[01:01:16.280 --> 01:01:18.280]  But right now, let's go to Eddie in Wisconsin.
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:20.280]  Eddie, welcome.
[01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:22.280]  Alex, how you doing today, brother?
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.280]  Pretty good, my friend.
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:27.280]  Hey, I just want to let you know up here in Wisconsin, man,
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:29.280]  we are alive and we are waking up, man.
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:33.280]  I just want to let you know that I'm spreading the word to everybody.
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:36.280]  Friends, family, people on the street.
[01:01:36.280 --> 01:01:38.280]  Listen to Alex Jones.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:40.280]  He knows what's going on, man.
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.280]  He supports you in Wisconsin, brother.
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:44.280]  Well, I want you to know that as this show explodes,
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:47.280]  I do it as a responsibility and as a sacred honor,
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:50.280]  and I do the best I can, and I am humbled.
[01:01:50.280 --> 01:01:53.280]  And I want everybody to know as this show explodes in size,
[01:01:53.280 --> 01:01:55.280]  I'm basically flying into the Death Star.
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:59.280]  So a lot of folks envy me and hate me because of that.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:02.280]  Not my listeners, but their hosts and people.
[01:02:02.280 --> 01:02:05.280]  They need to understand this is a great danger I'm in,
[01:02:05.280 --> 01:02:09.280]  and I'm only alive because of your prayers and the grace of God.
[01:02:09.280 --> 01:02:12.280]  And I am in God's hands, but there's a lot of attacks going on
[01:02:12.280 --> 01:02:15.280]  against me because I am now a figurehead of liberty,
[01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:18.280]  whether I like it or not, and quite frankly, I don't.
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:21.280]  But know this, the truth is going forth
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:24.280]  thanks to people like you, and we're not going to be stopped
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:28.280]  as long as we're bold in the face of this evil.
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:31.280]  I'm awake, down with the New World Order,
[01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.280]  and I say my prayers for you every day, brother.
[01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.280]  You keep rocking, all right?
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.280]  I need it. God bless you.
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:39.280]  God to protect me, and God's told me,
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:41.280]  people make fun of that, but you know, my discernment,
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:44.280]  then you've got to codily commit and get really hardcore
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:46.280]  the things you know are dangerous.
[01:02:46.280 --> 01:02:48.280]  Because even though you say you've got courage
[01:02:48.280 --> 01:02:50.280]  and don't care and don't have fear,
[01:02:50.280 --> 01:02:52.280]  you've been holding back, Jones.
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:55.280]  Well, not anymore.
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.280]  Not holding back anymore, okay?
[01:02:58.280 --> 01:03:03.280]  I've got all sorts of media operations I can throw at the globalist.
[01:03:03.280 --> 01:03:06.280]  I know how their system works, and I have been lazy.
[01:03:06.280 --> 01:03:08.280]  Years ago, I tried to stay small
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:11.280]  and actually fly into the radar.
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:13.280]  It was a form of subconscious cowardice
[01:03:13.280 --> 01:03:15.280]  that I have now psychoanalyzed myself,
[01:03:15.280 --> 01:03:18.280]  and I will not be part of.
[01:03:18.280 --> 01:03:20.280]  I will not be a coward.
[01:03:20.280 --> 01:03:23.280]  I will 110% engage the globalist.
[01:03:23.280 --> 01:03:25.280]  And I want you to do that as well.
[01:03:25.280 --> 01:03:27.280]  We're going to go to Brighton, come back in the long term,
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:29.280]  and go to Tony, Perry, Michael, Dylan,
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:32.280]  and others that are patiently holding.
[01:03:32.280 --> 01:03:34.280]  Then we've got Patrick Henningson coming on.
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:37.280]  We've got a lot of calls when Sean Stone's on with us.
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:40.280]  We'll just have a geopolitical discussion about the world.
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:42.280]  He is joining us via Skype, correct?
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:46.280]  We ever checked that out and confirmed that. Good.
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:48.280]  You know, I could have got Sean on.
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:51.280]  Speaking of how I don't ever really try to game the media,
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:53.280]  I know him well.
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:55.280]  I'm in the upcoming conspiracy theory show with him,
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:58.280]  and I knew he was talking about to me converting to Islam.
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:01.280]  Shia Islam.
[01:04:01.280 --> 01:04:04.280]  And I had his home number, Skype, everything.
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:06.280]  When he made the big announcement, of course,
[01:04:06.280 --> 01:04:09.280]  he'd actually contact me right before he made the announcement.
[01:04:09.280 --> 01:04:11.280]  For some reason, I just didn't jump on it.
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:13.280]  Didn't have him make the announcement of his conversion
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:15.280]  to Islam here on my show.
[01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.280]  Whatever reason, I just, a lot of times,
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:19.280]  even though I know something's going to be a big media event,
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:21.280]  I just don't touch it for whatever reason.
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:23.280]  And then now is the time to get Sean on.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:26.280]  Atri's been on O'Reilly and probably,
[01:04:26.280 --> 01:04:28.280]  I don't know, like a hundred different shows.
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.280]  I mean, he's been everywhere.
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:34.280]  But I'm getting him on.
[01:04:34.280 --> 01:04:42.280]  I'm getting him on about what he saw in Iran.
[01:04:42.280 --> 01:04:47.280]  Not even so much about his conversion to Islamic faith, Islam.
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:49.280]  All right, we'll be right back.
[01:04:49.280 --> 01:04:52.280]  Websites are infowarch.com and prisonplanet.tv.

[01:07:54.280 --> 01:08:21.280]  at fivestarsope.com.
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:27.280]  I'm about to go right back to your phone calls,
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:29.280]  but I want to give folks
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:31.280]  a state of the Info War report here
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:33.280]  in just about 60 seconds.
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:35.280]  For eight months, we've had Info Wars,
[01:08:35.280 --> 01:08:37.280]  Nightly News, we've beta tested the equipment,
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:40.280]  we've gotten a lot of our crew hired,
[01:08:40.280 --> 01:08:43.280]  and we have not missed one show
[01:08:43.280 --> 01:08:46.280]  in eight months, weeknight, seven o'clock.
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:48.280]  And the next time we
[01:08:48.280 --> 01:08:50.280]  take a pit stop like we're about to do
[01:08:50.280 --> 01:08:52.280]  for the next week and a half, two weeks,
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:54.280]  we'll probably never be able
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:08:56.280]  to take a break again.
[01:08:56.280 --> 01:08:58.280]  I've got to get a few people hired.
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:00.280]  I've got to put in some new equipment,
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:03.280]  and we were going to try to have our skeleton crew
[01:09:03.280 --> 01:09:06.280]  basically...
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:10.280]  Well, that phone really is rattling, isn't it?
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:13.280]  It's a man cow.
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:17.280]  Can't call him during a radio interview.
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:20.280]  Anyways, getting back to what I was saying,
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:23.280]  we have had tremendous success.
[01:09:23.280 --> 01:09:25.280]  It's gone very well.
[01:09:25.280 --> 01:09:27.280]  We're already picked up in the major cable system
[01:09:27.280 --> 01:09:29.280]  in England without even trying.
[01:09:29.280 --> 01:09:31.280]  A lot of cable systems are already picking it up here.
[01:09:31.280 --> 01:09:33.280]  So the next time we do a pit stop,
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:35.280]  we won't be able to because it's...
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:37.280]  We've got to get the satellite link
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:39.280]  and all this other stuff set up.
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:41.280]  I've got to get two or three more people
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:43.280]  and then get them trained.
[01:09:43.280 --> 01:09:45.280]  I mean, it's a real growth curve
[01:09:45.280 --> 01:09:47.280]  when you're doing all this from scratch
[01:09:47.280 --> 01:09:49.280]  as we've done and really reinventing
[01:09:49.280 --> 01:09:51.280]  so for the next two weeks or so,
[01:09:51.280 --> 01:09:53.280]  we're going to have a few live shows
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:55.280]  on the nightly news.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:57.280]  We're going to have some special reports
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:59.280]  like the Big Dave Mustaine interview,
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:01.280]  but because I've only got like four or five guys
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:03.280]  on the whole TV show,
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:05.280]  I need them to revamp graphics,
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:07.280]  do the interviews and the resumes,
[01:10:07.280 --> 01:10:09.280]  train people.
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:12.280]  I've got to shoot a video that is
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:15.280]  going to be a promo
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:18.280]  for a contest I'm going to have
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:20.280]  to hire one or two
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:22.280]  new reporters.
[01:10:22.280 --> 01:10:24.280]  So I've just got to
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:26.280]  pull into the pit stop for a minute
[01:10:26.280 --> 01:10:28.280]  to get new tires and gas
[01:10:28.280 --> 01:10:30.280]  in the Formula One race car here
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:32.280]  to get it back on the road.
[01:10:32.280 --> 01:10:34.280]  In fact, I intended to go about two months
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:36.280]  and then have a week or two hiatus,
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:38.280]  but we just got so caught up in the treadmill
[01:10:38.280 --> 01:10:40.280]  and the special reports and the gas
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:42.280]  and everything we're doing that I never did it.
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:44.280]  So we're eight months into this.
[01:10:44.280 --> 01:10:46.280]  I would like to buy
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:48.280]  April or even before April
[01:10:48.280 --> 01:10:50.280]  be able to revamp and relaunch
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:52.280]  and then we'll go about four or five months again
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:54.280]  and then be done and actually formulate
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:56.280]  the show down to a set amount of time.
[01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:58.280]  You know, right now some nights it's two hours long,
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:00.280]  other nights it's 45 minutes.
[01:11:00.280 --> 01:11:02.280]  It's going to be a set time. I've got to figure all that out.
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:04.280]  And then we'll have one more short pit stop
[01:11:04.280 --> 01:11:06.280]  for about a week
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:08.280]  when the show is officially launched
[01:11:08.280 --> 01:11:10.280]  and then we can never stop.
[01:11:10.280 --> 01:11:12.280]  So
[01:11:12.280 --> 01:11:14.280]  even Glenn Beck launched this TV show
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:16.280]  and then most days it isn't even a new show.
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:18.280]  With us, it's been eight months straight
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:20.280]  of nothing but new shows
[01:11:20.280 --> 01:11:22.280]  every evening. So again, for the next two weeks
[01:11:22.280 --> 01:11:24.280]  we're going to take a pit stop
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:26.280]  and
[01:11:26.280 --> 01:11:28.280]  there'll be The Dave Mustaine interview,
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:30.280]  a couple of shows where I have big guestbook
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:32.280]  that I will be doing it, but most nights
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:34.280]  it'll be old special reports,
[01:11:34.280 --> 01:11:36.280]  special compilations and other things
[01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.280]  at PrismPlanet.TV where all my films are posted.
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:42.280]  We're almost nine years of material are
[01:11:42.280 --> 01:11:44.280]  and so much more.
[01:11:44.280 --> 01:11:46.280]  And there will be other special reports that will also air.
[01:11:46.280 --> 01:11:48.280]  So it'll be like a special report
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:50.280]  instead of the nightly news that you'll see.
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:52.280]  So a lot of it will be new. Some of it
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:54.280]  will just be compilations of old stuff that we've aired.
[01:11:54.280 --> 01:11:56.280]  So that's coming up in the next two weeks
[01:11:56.280 --> 01:11:58.280]  and then you'll see a relaunch
[01:11:58.280 --> 01:12:00.280]  of the news. It's been a giant success
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:02.280]  and we couldn't have done it without you.
[01:12:02.280 --> 01:12:04.280]  We have the 15 day free trial running if you want to be a PrismPlanet.TV member.
[01:12:06.280 --> 01:12:08.280]  Okay, Tony in New York, welcome sir.
[01:12:08.280 --> 01:12:10.280]  Good to have you here with us today.
[01:12:10.280 --> 01:12:12.280]  How's it going? Pretty good sir.
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:14.280]  That's good. I don't even know really where to start.
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:16.280]  So basically
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:20.280]  I saw that you had talked about the enterprise
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:22.280]  having off to Iran
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:24.280]  and
[01:12:24.280 --> 01:12:26.280]  I don't know if it made national news or not.
[01:12:26.280 --> 01:12:28.280]  I'm up near Syracuse. I'm pretty sure this was
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:30.280]  the same ship, but
[01:12:30.280 --> 01:12:32.280]  there was a, I think there was an admiral
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:34.280]  or the second in command, I think it was with the enterprise.
[01:12:34.280 --> 01:12:36.280]  He got lambasted probably six months
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:38.280]  a year ago. They had a whole big deal
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:40.280]  about him
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:42.280]  making videos and sexually harassing people
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:44.280]  or something. It was like a training video.
[01:12:44.280 --> 01:12:46.280]  It was supposed to be humorous or something.
[01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:48.280]  I'm not really sure the details.
[01:12:48.280 --> 01:12:50.280]  All I know is they love to blow up ships
[01:12:50.280 --> 01:12:52.280]  at Pearl Harbor. It was a bunch of battleships
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:54.280]  about to be decommissioned. They tied them up
[01:12:54.280 --> 01:12:56.280]  had their carriers going hide.
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:58.280]  Japanese subs attacked an hour before
[01:12:58.280 --> 01:13:00.280]  they were still ordered to stand down. That's on record.
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:02.280]  It's not any of the movies and stuff, but
[01:13:02.280 --> 01:13:04.280]  five subs attacked.
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:06.280]  One of them is at the Pacific War Museum
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:08.280]  in Fredericksburg and they just admitted there.
[01:13:08.280 --> 01:13:10.280]  But it's hidden in plain view.
[01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:12.280]  An hour and 15 minutes before
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:14.280]  the subs
[01:13:14.280 --> 01:13:16.280]  start attacking and still the base was told
[01:13:16.280 --> 01:13:18.280]  to stand down. I mean, it's admitted
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:20.280]  there. It's an incredible museum, by the way.
[01:13:20.280 --> 01:13:22.280]  They got
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:24.280]  the shells of Fat Boy,
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:26.280]  the A-bomb.
[01:13:26.280 --> 01:13:28.280]  It's one of the best military museums
[01:13:28.280 --> 01:13:30.280]  I've ever seen out in Fredericksburg.
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:32.280]  But that said, hidden in plain view
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:34.280]  is one of the midget subs that attacked
[01:13:34.280 --> 01:13:36.280]  and everybody's like, wait,
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:38.280]  it attacked an hour plus before
[01:13:38.280 --> 01:13:40.280]  with four other subs,
[01:13:40.280 --> 01:13:42.280]  but still nobody knew that the Japanese
[01:13:42.280 --> 01:13:44.280]  attack was coming.
[01:13:44.280 --> 01:13:46.280]  I mean, it's just crazy. So yes,
[01:13:46.280 --> 01:13:48.280]  they love to blow up the towers because
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:50.280]  they were leaning and had asbestos in them.
[01:13:50.280 --> 01:13:52.280]  And a lot of people have said, look for a false flag
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:54.280]  on this aircraft carrier.
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:56.280]  But because we've exposed it, that
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:13:58.280]  may not happen yet. Your take on that.
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:00.280]  Well, that's kind of
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:02.280]  what I was wondering. I was wondering if that was almost
[01:14:02.280 --> 01:14:04.280]  a preemptive sort of a thing where they
[01:14:04.280 --> 01:14:06.280]  kind of got him out,
[01:14:06.280 --> 01:14:08.280]  basically lambasted him and
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:10.280]  moved him off the ship and I'm not
[01:14:10.280 --> 01:14:12.280]  really sure what they did to his career.
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:14.280]  But I'm thinking, maybe he was one of the
[01:14:14.280 --> 01:14:16.280]  people that was refusing to
[01:14:16.280 --> 01:14:18.280]  kind of go along with the whole
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:20.280]  UN, New World Order kind of stuff.
[01:14:20.280 --> 01:14:22.280]  They've been, sir, the last two chairman wouldn't go
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.280]  along with it and were kicked out.
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:26.280]  The last head of Sintcom,
[01:14:26.280 --> 01:14:28.280]  Fox Fallon refused.
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:30.280]  It's not speculation. We know
[01:14:30.280 --> 01:14:32.280]  they've been purging the upper ranks
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:34.280]  because most of these guys are not traders.
[01:14:34.280 --> 01:14:36.280]  They've got grandchildren, they love America
[01:14:36.280 --> 01:14:38.280]  and they may have bent the rules
[01:14:38.280 --> 01:14:40.280]  for the United States, but they're not going to do it
[01:14:40.280 --> 01:14:42.280]  under any New World Order command.
[01:14:42.280 --> 01:14:44.280]  And so this is the big time
[01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:46.280]  to make a decision which side you're on. Good points.
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:48.280]  Good to hear from you. I mean, the global
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:50.280]  government's out in the open now.
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:52.280]  I've made my decision. I'm against it.
[01:14:52.280 --> 01:14:54.280]  Dylan in Montana,
[01:14:54.280 --> 01:14:56.280]  you're on the air. Welcome.
[01:14:56.280 --> 01:14:58.280]  Hey, great to talk to you, sir.
[01:14:58.280 --> 01:15:00.280]  Yes, sir. Good to talk to you. What's on your mind?
[01:15:00.280 --> 01:15:02.280]  I can't tell you a story
[01:15:02.280 --> 01:15:04.280]  about something that happened to me in Sarasota
[01:15:04.280 --> 01:15:06.280]  with the TSA.
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:08.280]  It was something I had never, ever heard of happening.
[01:15:08.280 --> 01:15:10.280]  Let me write this down
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:12.280]  because every time we get a call
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:14.280]  about some new perversion that they're doing,
[01:15:14.280 --> 01:15:16.280]  I look it up and somebody else has complained about it.
[01:15:16.280 --> 01:15:18.280]  So nothing we've heard
[01:15:18.280 --> 01:15:20.280]  has not been true. It's always worse, no matter how crazy.
[01:15:20.280 --> 01:15:22.280]  Tell me what happened in Sarasota, Florida.
[01:15:22.280 --> 01:15:24.280]  Yeah, Sarasota, Florida.
[01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:26.280]  We went through the scanner
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:28.280]  or my family
[01:15:28.280 --> 01:15:30.280]  went through the security checkpoint
[01:15:30.280 --> 01:15:32.280]  and I got my dad
[01:15:32.280 --> 01:15:34.280]  to not go through the scanner with me
[01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:36.280]  and we both had
[01:15:36.280 --> 01:15:38.280]  to be patted down and it was just
[01:15:38.280 --> 01:15:40.280]  ridiculous.
[01:15:40.280 --> 01:15:42.280]  And then we went inside after the checkpoint
[01:15:42.280 --> 01:15:44.280]  and we were in the airport
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:46.280]  went to the Starbucks
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:48.280]  there. No, and they came and harassed you
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:50.280]  at the Starbucks or then again at the gate.
[01:15:50.280 --> 01:15:52.280]  That happens all the time.
[01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:54.280]  No, no, not even that.
[01:15:54.280 --> 01:15:56.280]  Everyone had bought coffee
[01:15:56.280 --> 01:15:58.280]  because it's 4 in the morning, you know.
[01:15:58.280 --> 01:16:00.280]  And there is this lady
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:02.280]  who's going around with a
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:04.280]  like a Q-tip swab
[01:16:04.280 --> 01:16:06.280]  and
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:08.280]  she was dipping it
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:10.280]  into everybody's coffee mug
[01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:12.280]  and keep in mind this is after the security checkpoint.
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:14.280]  This is inside
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:16.280]  of the airport and she's testing all...
[01:16:16.280 --> 01:16:18.280]  I've seen them pull people
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:20.280]  over in the airport, you know, like
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:22.280]  they're a cop and they just come over
[01:16:22.280 --> 01:16:24.280]  and blind, literally
[01:16:24.280 --> 01:16:26.280]  that they want to get their little hands on
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:28.280]  and they do grope downs. Oh, you're hot.
[01:16:28.280 --> 01:16:30.280]  Let's do a little groping. I mean, literally
[01:16:30.280 --> 01:16:32.280]  they've been caught doing it. Oh my gosh, you're
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:34.280]  completely gorgeous. Grope down time
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:36.280]  and they also like to harass old people for
[01:16:36.280 --> 01:16:38.280]  whatever reason. If you're in a wheelchair or whatever
[01:16:38.280 --> 01:16:40.280]  look out, wolves attack.
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:42.280]  But I want to hear your story, but I have seen
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:44.280]  them swabbing luggage and stuff inside.
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:46.280]  You're saying she comes up with their dirty
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:48.280]  gloves and is sticking it in your coffee?
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:50.280]  Yes, exactly.
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:52.280]  And then she'd take it over to this guy
[01:16:52.280 --> 01:16:54.280]  who was testing it for, I don't
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:56.280]  know what, flavor
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:16:58.280]  or, you know, explosives
[01:16:58.280 --> 01:17:00.280]  or whatever. And this was a TSA person?
[01:17:00.280 --> 01:17:02.280]  Yeah, these were both TSA
[01:17:02.280 --> 01:17:04.280]  people inside the airport.
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:06.280]  And so I
[01:17:06.280 --> 01:17:08.280]  couldn't handle it, so I just dumped my coffee
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:10.280]  out because I was with my parents, didn't want to make
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:12.280]  a scene. Let me stop you, describe this.
[01:17:12.280 --> 01:17:14.280]  So a person in a TSA outfit
[01:17:14.280 --> 01:17:16.280]  comes over, now the Q
[01:17:16.280 --> 01:17:18.280]  tip, were they sticking it in and then throwing it away
[01:17:18.280 --> 01:17:20.280]  or were they just going along because they already
[01:17:20.280 --> 01:17:22.280]  could care less. They wear the gloves to protect
[01:17:22.280 --> 01:17:24.280]  themselves, but don't change them until they've
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:26.280]  searched like 400 people, they admit.
[01:17:26.280 --> 01:17:28.280]  They make you take your shoes off and walk through
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:30.280]  the flesh-eating MRSA and
[01:17:30.280 --> 01:17:32.280]  the fungus and everything.
[01:17:32.280 --> 01:17:34.280]  Describe this for me blow by blow.
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:36.280]  Well,
[01:17:36.280 --> 01:17:38.280]  they'd take the Q tip
[01:17:38.280 --> 01:17:40.280]  and they would dip it into the mouthpiece
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:42.280]  of, you know,
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:44.280]  of the Starbucks cup.
[01:17:44.280 --> 01:17:46.280]  Sure, the plastic cover a little hole
[01:17:46.280 --> 01:17:48.280]  they wouldn't ask, they just come over and stick it
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:50.280]  in your coffee. I'd be like, no.
[01:17:50.280 --> 01:17:52.280]  Exactly.
[01:17:52.280 --> 01:17:54.280]  And then she'd go back and test it
[01:17:54.280 --> 01:17:56.280]  for explosives at this
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:58.280]  other place.
[01:17:58.280 --> 01:18:00.280]  And it was ridiculous, so I went up
[01:18:00.280 --> 01:18:02.280]  and asked this man, I was like, so what just happened
[01:18:02.280 --> 01:18:04.280]  did that really just happen? And he goes,
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:06.280]  we literally, this is the quote, he goes,
[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:08.280]  oh, it's just more protection.
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:10.280]  Well, see, they
[01:18:10.280 --> 01:18:12.280]  want to make it ridiculous. In the military
[01:18:12.280 --> 01:18:14.280]  they make you do weird chants
[01:18:14.280 --> 01:18:16.280]  and it's kind of like a full-metal jacket.
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:18.280]  That's based on a composite of true stories
[01:18:18.280 --> 01:18:20.280]  where they make them grab themselves sexually
[01:18:20.280 --> 01:18:22.280]  and say, this is my rifle, this is my gun,
[01:18:22.280 --> 01:18:24.280]  this is for fighting, this is for fun.
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:26.280]  And people say, why do you do that?
[01:18:26.280 --> 01:18:28.280]  Well, it's about the troops do what they're told
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:30.280]  no matter how stupid it sounds. When I say jump
[01:18:30.280 --> 01:18:32.280]  you say how high. And that's all this
[01:18:32.280 --> 01:18:34.280]  is and
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:36.280]  I'm going to have to look into this. I've seen them
[01:18:36.280 --> 01:18:38.280]  swabbing people's hands and stuff
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:40.280]  you know, all over the airport, but
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:42.280]  I've seen them take water away that was already
[01:18:42.280 --> 01:18:44.280]  bought through the checkpoint. Again,
[01:18:44.280 --> 01:18:46.280]  it's all about teaching you you're guilty.
[01:18:46.280 --> 01:18:48.280]  I wish you would have gotten photos or video
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:50.280]  of this. Other people, have you seen this?
[01:18:50.280 --> 01:18:52.280]  Please email us, please
[01:18:52.280 --> 01:18:54.280]  Twitter, you know
[01:18:54.280 --> 01:18:56.280]  make comments at Real Alex Jones
[01:18:56.280 --> 01:18:58.280]  at Twitter because I want to look into
[01:18:58.280 --> 01:19:00.280]  this. This is definitely newsworthy if they're now getting
[01:19:00.280 --> 01:19:02.280]  into your Starbucks coffee.
[01:19:02.280 --> 01:19:04.280]  Definitely.
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:06.280]  So they came over to you and you just said
[01:19:06.280 --> 01:19:08.280]  no one dumped it out?
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:10.280]  Yes, I just, I wasn't going to be able
[01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:12.280]  to handle it. I was with my parents and
[01:19:12.280 --> 01:19:14.280]  they, I just didn't want to create a scene
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:16.280]  it was. By the way, we made jokes
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:18.280]  about them wanting to do chest x-rays to make sure there's
[01:19:18.280 --> 01:19:20.280]  not breast bombs. They now announced that in Australia
[01:19:20.280 --> 01:19:22.280]  and the U.S. they want to start pilots
[01:19:22.280 --> 01:19:24.280]  and I'm not joking. They're now
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:26.280]  talking about in the strip searches they may
[01:19:26.280 --> 01:19:28.280]  start actually doing a rectal exam.
[01:19:28.280 --> 01:19:30.280]  I saw that a few weeks ago where they're
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:32.280]  discussing taser bracelets
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:34.280]  around your arms, Homeland Security officially is
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:36.280]  where everyone gets a taser and actually
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:38.280]  putting their fingers in your hind end
[01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:40.280]  now. I'm sorry to talk like that folks but
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:42.280]  and I think most Americans will actually
[01:19:42.280 --> 01:19:44.280]  bend over. That should be the new American flag
[01:19:44.280 --> 01:19:46.280]  is like a big
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:48.280]  fat
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:50.280]  Janet Reno type with a plastic glove
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:52.280]  on their hand and a man
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:54.280]  and I'm sorry I just, it's unbelievable
[01:19:54.280 --> 01:19:56.280]  and people are like this is improper to talk about.
[01:19:56.280 --> 01:19:58.280]  They're doing it. We got to stop it.
[01:19:58.280 --> 01:20:00.280]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[01:20:00.280 --> 01:20:02.280]  I had tried everything.
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:04.280]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was
[01:20:04.280 --> 01:20:06.280]  eating. I was lifting weights and jogging
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:08.280]  but nothing was working.
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:10.280]  My body was literally starving
[01:20:10.280 --> 01:20:12.280]  for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins
[01:20:12.280 --> 01:20:14.280]  and as soon as I had that
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:16.280]  I immediately could eat
[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:18.280]  half of what I was eating previously
[01:20:18.280 --> 01:20:20.280]  and be satisfied. Now there are
[01:20:20.280 --> 01:20:22.280]  hundreds of great products at InfoWarsTeam.com
[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:24.280]  but I want to point out the three
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:26.280]  that have helped me lose
[01:20:26.280 --> 01:20:28.280]  37 pounds
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:30.280]  in just two months.
[01:20:30.280 --> 01:20:32.280]  Products like Beyond Tangy
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:34.280]  Tangerine, Holland Burst
[01:20:34.280 --> 01:20:36.280]  and Rebound. When I started taking
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:38.280]  the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day
[01:20:38.280 --> 01:20:40.280]  I lost more than 37
[01:20:40.280 --> 01:20:42.280]  pounds in just two months. Now that's
[01:20:42.280 --> 01:20:44.280]  results. I want to challenge

[02:02:56.280 --> 02:03:01.280]  Obama birth certificate is the federal issue, the federal agencies coming in and dictating
[02:03:01.280 --> 02:03:05.320]  how you're going to do border control, dictating how you're going to deal with your own immigration
[02:03:05.320 --> 02:03:09.520]  problems versus the state being able to handle their own affairs.
[02:03:09.520 --> 02:03:10.520]  That's right.
[02:03:10.520 --> 02:03:12.520]  You've got to defend yourself.
[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:13.520]  Defense is always good.
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:20.320]  I hate to copy a Star Wars thing, but knowledge and defense never for attack because the position
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:22.400]  of power is from defense, true defense.
[02:03:22.400 --> 02:03:25.680]  So they call it defense department, it's really war department.
[02:03:25.680 --> 02:03:33.080]  But that's the bottom line is that we've got to be in that position to defend the innocence,
[02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:36.960]  to have courage, but the globalists are destroying themselves.
[02:03:36.960 --> 02:03:41.320]  You have to defend yourself from a position of righteousness and you always have to have
[02:03:41.320 --> 02:03:44.880]  a moral backbone or you have to have a moral basis to do this.
[02:03:44.880 --> 02:03:46.520]  We have this in the United States.
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:50.480]  You have to defer to the U.S. Constitution and Bill of Rights.
[02:03:50.480 --> 02:03:55.640]  That's there, our founding fathers gave it to us, fantastic document, genius, okay?
[02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:58.440]  That is your moral backstop in this country.
[02:03:58.440 --> 02:03:59.440]  Do not be afraid.
[02:03:59.440 --> 02:04:03.680]  Yeah, those that attack first and then attack innocence, no matter, no amount of propaganda
[02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:05.240]  or technology is going to prop them up.
[02:04:05.240 --> 02:04:06.840]  This evil will fall.
[02:04:06.840 --> 02:04:10.240]  We need to be there putting out the opposite the truth so people have an alternative.
[02:04:10.240 --> 02:04:15.040]  You know, Alex, before I came doing this journalistic work, I worked in the corporate world, okay?
[02:04:15.040 --> 02:04:18.480]  I was scared to death when I put my first stories up online.
[02:04:18.480 --> 02:04:22.200]  You can imagine or when your first time here on TV, scared that, oh my God, what's going
[02:04:22.200 --> 02:04:23.200]  to happen to me now?
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:26.720]  I just said something really outrageous, but you know, people got to realize everybody
[02:04:26.720 --> 02:04:30.640]  out there has got a certain amount of power to influence their families, their friends
[02:04:30.640 --> 02:04:31.640]  and so forth.
[02:04:31.640 --> 02:04:32.640]  That's right.
[02:04:32.640 --> 02:04:33.640]  You can't be afraid.
[02:04:33.640 --> 02:04:35.160]  Well, you're going to make enemies, but you're also going to make friends.
[02:04:35.160 --> 02:04:36.160]  It's empowering.
[02:04:36.160 --> 02:04:42.880]  You've got to say who you are, wear your colors so that you can join with those who are like-minded.
[02:04:42.880 --> 02:04:44.680]  And so the enemy knows your flag.
[02:04:44.680 --> 02:04:45.680]  God bless you.
[02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:47.680]  I want to get you back in for an hour this week to talk about all that.
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:51.360]  Patrick Hennigson, RiceFriendFullWorks.com, and just shot this great video report.
[02:04:51.360 --> 02:04:53.120]  We're going to be posting the next hour or two.
[02:04:53.120 --> 02:04:55.240]  Darren McBrain is going to add some documents to it.
[02:04:55.240 --> 02:04:56.240]  Thank you so much.
[02:04:56.240 --> 02:04:57.240]  Thank you, Alex.
[02:04:57.240 --> 02:04:58.240]  Amazing.
[02:04:58.240 --> 02:05:01.400]  All right, Sean Stone, straight ahead.
[02:05:01.400 --> 02:05:02.400]  I had tried everything.
[02:05:02.400 --> 02:05:04.840]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating.
[02:05:04.840 --> 02:05:08.040]  I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[02:05:08.040 --> 02:05:12.560]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements, as well as key vitamins.
[02:05:12.560 --> 02:05:18.240]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously
[02:05:18.240 --> 02:05:19.240]  and be satisfied.
[02:05:19.240 --> 02:05:23.760]  Now, there are hundreds of great products at InfowarsTeam.com, but I want to point out
[02:05:23.760 --> 02:05:31.360]  the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:05:31.360 --> 02:05:35.520]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Holland Burst, and Rebound.
[02:05:35.520 --> 02:05:39.280]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day, I lost more
[02:05:39.280 --> 02:05:41.760]  than 37 pounds in just two months.
[02:05:41.760 --> 02:05:43.160]  Now, that's results.
[02:05:43.160 --> 02:05:48.920]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to InfowarsTeam.com and to order just three of
[02:05:48.920 --> 02:05:49.920]  their products.
[02:05:49.920 --> 02:05:56.000]  And you will see the changes in the way you look, feel, and in your appetite almost immediately.

[02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:21.920]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:06:21.920 --> 02:06:29.040]  They're so bright in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:06:29.040 --> 02:06:35.120]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:40.080]  Blue diamond gussets got it, others don't.
[02:06:40.080 --> 02:06:46.880]  We turn jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.
[02:06:46.880 --> 02:06:51.440]  Our Defender motorcycle jeans combine gusset comfort with Kevlar protection so you can

[02:07:01.640 --> 02:07:03.280]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones.
[02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:08.160]  I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings, opportunity and recognized
[02:07:08.160 --> 02:07:09.160]  risk.
[02:07:09.160 --> 02:07:10.160]  Saving means to make money.
[02:07:10.160 --> 02:07:14.440]  The Calben Pure Soap Company can save you thousands of dollars and give you good old
[02:07:14.440 --> 02:07:20.000]  fashioned real soaps that are triple concentrated and twice as good as what you're using now.
[02:07:20.000 --> 02:07:25.720]  Soaps made from vegetable and coconut oils that contain no useless dyes, perfumes deodorants
[02:07:25.720 --> 02:07:27.400]  or antibacterials.
[02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:32.920]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores
[02:07:32.920 --> 02:07:35.320]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[02:07:35.320 --> 02:07:38.600]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have
[02:07:38.600 --> 02:07:40.680]  to do something you've never done before.
[02:07:40.680 --> 02:07:48.800]  Getting a free catalog is easy by calling 800-340-7091 or see Calben on the Web at 5starsoap.com.

[02:08:02.200 --> 02:08:25.040]  Please the T-Rex of political talk, Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:25.040 --> 02:08:30.360]  Well I hadn't seen the new Wall Street film yet, it's been I don't know a year or two.
[02:08:30.360 --> 02:08:34.800]  And I watched a big part of it yesterday and then the rest of it today while I was on the
[02:08:34.800 --> 02:08:40.040]  treadmill jogging and an excellent film produced by Oliver Stone and I did notice a little
[02:08:40.040 --> 02:08:45.280]  cameo in there with the one, the only Sean Stone, but I do want to bring up that film
[02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:46.280]  a little bit.
[02:08:46.280 --> 02:08:50.040]  I've had him on the show before and never raised up about his dad but I just wanted to get
[02:08:50.040 --> 02:08:55.600]  his take on that film and ask what his favorite film of all time is but he's here to talk
[02:08:55.600 --> 02:09:02.440]  about very, very serious issues, he's Sean Stone and he is a documentary filmmaker, TV
[02:09:02.440 --> 02:09:12.720]  producer, TV host of prolific work and he is one of the big reporters on the third season
[02:09:12.720 --> 02:09:18.440]  of conspiracy theory with Jesse Ventura and Tyrell Ventura coming out very, very soon.
[02:09:18.440 --> 02:09:22.820]  I talked to Tyrell last week and they're not quite sure on the date yet but we should
[02:09:22.820 --> 02:09:26.360]  have that for you soon but I wanted to get him on.
[02:09:26.360 --> 02:09:29.560]  For whatever reason I didn't get him on when he first made his big announcement a few
[02:09:29.560 --> 02:09:34.920]  weeks ago and he's been on all Riley, CNN, basically everything, the down on the aftermath
[02:09:34.920 --> 02:09:36.440]  will get him on.
[02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:42.480]  He went and converted to, I guess, Shiite Islam in Iran and when I was out in Las Vegas
[02:09:42.480 --> 02:09:45.920]  we were looking at some rocket bases and other things out there for an investigation we
[02:09:45.920 --> 02:09:46.920]  were doing.
[02:09:46.920 --> 02:09:51.360]  He showed me his sword of Ali around his neck and he said, I'm thinking about converting
[02:09:51.360 --> 02:09:55.360]  and we didn't really talk much about it but he said, no, I'm serious but the way he's
[02:09:55.360 --> 02:10:00.360]  described it is and that's what the Bible says, it all comes out of Abraham Judaism
[02:10:00.360 --> 02:10:05.400]  and then of course Christianity and then Islam and most major sects of Islam understand
[02:10:05.400 --> 02:10:06.400]  that and know that.
[02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:09.320]  So I think for his statement, maybe I'm putting words in his mouth, what I've gotten from
[02:10:09.320 --> 02:10:16.080]  what he said is that he's basically just pointing out that at least in its roots all goes back
[02:10:16.080 --> 02:10:20.200]  to the same God and let's stop killing each other like Rodney King, can't we all just
[02:10:20.200 --> 02:10:21.200]  get along.
[02:10:21.200 --> 02:10:26.400]  If I'm wrong, am I putting words in Sean Stone's mouth, we can find out right now because he
[02:10:26.400 --> 02:10:27.400]  joins us.
[02:10:27.400 --> 02:10:28.400]  Sean, great to have you on.
[02:10:28.400 --> 02:10:29.400]  Hey Alex, thank you.
[02:10:29.400 --> 02:10:32.040]  We'll be back and stand to talk to you again.
[02:10:32.040 --> 02:10:35.360]  Well, I just, you know, set a whole bunch of stuff.
[02:10:35.360 --> 02:10:40.040]  What's your take on what I said and why did you go to Iran and convert to Shiite Islam?
[02:10:40.040 --> 02:10:46.280]  Well, I didn't go to Iran just to convert and nor have I, I would never say that I converted.
[02:10:46.280 --> 02:10:49.440]  I've always said that I accepted Islam and as you said, I believe.
[02:10:49.440 --> 02:10:50.440]  Oh, accepted it.
[02:10:50.440 --> 02:10:51.440]  Oh, sure.
[02:10:51.440 --> 02:10:55.800]  Exactly, Islam, because all it means to accept Islam is to accept that Muhammad is a prophet
[02:10:55.800 --> 02:11:00.520]  of God, the same lineage going back to Abraham, Moses and Christ.
[02:11:00.520 --> 02:11:05.600]  So you know, the Islam itself is, you know, very similar to Judaism, the Sharia law is
[02:11:05.600 --> 02:11:09.680]  based on Mosaic law, their respect for Christ is tremendous.
[02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:13.960]  They believe that there will be a last judgment and Christ will return to earth as part of
[02:11:13.960 --> 02:11:18.400]  the second coming and they believe, you know, that they are part of this process.
[02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:24.040]  So it's not that I don't, you know, in truth, the spirit of Islam is not contradictory at
[02:11:24.040 --> 02:11:26.560]  all and they are very respectful of the people of the book.
[02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:31.920]  I think that ultimately in spirit, all of us, you know, all people of the book are opposed
[02:11:31.920 --> 02:11:36.600]  to paganism, to the idea of God creation or cults, atheism and Satanism.
[02:11:36.600 --> 02:11:41.240]  I think those are actually the real enemies of the religions and anyone who says otherwise,
[02:11:41.240 --> 02:11:44.360]  for example, within the religions, there are Satanists, you know, within the Catholic church,
[02:11:44.360 --> 02:11:50.120]  there are Satanists within Islam, there are Satanists who worship the ego, who incite people
[02:11:50.120 --> 02:11:54.400]  to violence against other people, you know, worshipers of God, who don't understand the
[02:11:54.400 --> 02:11:58.640]  ultimate message that which is that we need to devote ourselves to one God as opposed
[02:11:58.640 --> 02:12:02.240]  to these cults that are created largely by the financial sector.
[02:12:02.240 --> 02:12:05.760]  If you think about it, going back to Babylon, when the priestcraft would basically send
[02:12:05.760 --> 02:12:08.480]  up, deploy God cults around the empire.
[02:12:08.480 --> 02:12:11.560]  So you get like, you know, Apollo, the cult of Apollo, the cult of Mithras, the cult
[02:12:11.560 --> 02:12:12.960]  of Isis, right?
[02:12:12.960 --> 02:12:15.400]  And as you saw with the Bohemian Grove, that's what they do.
[02:12:15.400 --> 02:12:19.600]  They deploy these different cults and you do blood sacrifice or money sacrifice, debt
[02:12:19.600 --> 02:12:22.480]  sacrifice ultimately, to that God.
[02:12:22.480 --> 02:12:25.600]  So the Federal Reserve, for example, is a temple.
[02:12:25.600 --> 02:12:26.600]  That's why the Federal Reserve...
[02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:29.440]  No, they admit that they build these government buildings as temples.
[02:12:29.440 --> 02:12:33.760]  I want to get into this with you because I know that we were in Las Vegas and, you know,
[02:12:33.760 --> 02:12:37.160]  walked around and investigated that, but you're absolutely right.
[02:12:37.160 --> 02:12:43.280]  The occult means hidden and it's the science of manipulating people and hidden knowledge,
[02:12:43.280 --> 02:12:48.840]  whereas, you know, the great three big faiths are all about everything being in the open.
[02:12:48.840 --> 02:12:52.760]  And so it's all about being hidden or being out in the open.
[02:12:52.760 --> 02:12:53.760]  You're right.
[02:12:53.760 --> 02:12:57.200]  The Satanist and the Luciferians, they're all deceivers.
[02:12:57.200 --> 02:13:00.640]  They're all about operating in secret and using deception.
[02:13:00.640 --> 02:13:01.640]  Very well said.
[02:13:01.640 --> 02:13:02.840]  In fact, please elaborate.
[02:13:02.840 --> 02:13:08.040]  Let's get into your research on the Illuminati that you were trying to get into.
[02:13:08.040 --> 02:13:10.800]  Well, just simply to put that this is old, it goes back to ancient Babylon when you're
[02:13:10.800 --> 02:13:11.800]  basically...
[02:13:11.800 --> 02:13:16.120]  You're basically, you know, the whole concept of the pound of flesh that's owed in debt,
[02:13:16.120 --> 02:13:17.120]  right?
[02:13:17.120 --> 02:13:21.440]  In the Merchant of Venice, Shakespeare points this out that you either owe me the money
[02:13:21.440 --> 02:13:24.680]  or if you don't pay the money, you owe me a pound of flesh.
[02:13:24.680 --> 02:13:28.120]  And that's essentially what these temples are designed to do.
[02:13:28.120 --> 02:13:32.400]  That's why the temples would always put the image of God on the coin, the currency.
[02:13:32.400 --> 02:13:34.520]  So the idea is that you're basically creating a fake God.
[02:13:34.520 --> 02:13:35.520]  You can't...
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:37.920]  And that's why Islam talks about the fact that you can't...
[02:13:37.920 --> 02:13:42.920]  The reason you can't put Muhammad's face or God's face on coin is because they don't
[02:13:42.920 --> 02:13:44.800]  want you to worship an image of God.
[02:13:44.800 --> 02:13:45.800]  They should...
[02:13:45.800 --> 02:13:46.800]  You know, it goes back to...
[02:13:46.800 --> 02:13:47.800]  The idols.
[02:13:47.800 --> 02:13:48.800] ...smashing the idols.
[02:13:48.800 --> 02:13:52.120]  So what we've created, though, in the West is a very satanic culture of idol worship,
[02:13:52.120 --> 02:13:53.120]  whether...
[02:13:53.120 --> 02:13:54.920]  Because it's about your energy and your money going to these people.
[02:13:54.920 --> 02:13:59.120]  You create, you know, an idol out of Madonna and, you know, and Britney Spears and Michael
[02:13:59.120 --> 02:14:03.840]  Jackson, whoever it may be, these cults of worship, and that's the old Dionysian cult,
[02:14:03.840 --> 02:14:07.680]  right, where you go and you basically have orgies around these rock concerts or in these
[02:14:07.680 --> 02:14:10.800]  clubs, guided by the music of the cult master.
[02:14:10.800 --> 02:14:11.800]  And as we...
[02:14:11.800 --> 02:14:15.600]  As I've studied and you know, there's a lot of Illuminati influence involved in actually
[02:14:15.600 --> 02:14:22.000]  the creation of this music, magical words, for example, witchcraft words, words of witchcraft.
[02:14:22.000 --> 02:14:29.080]  You can glimpse it in, for example, Led Zeppelin's work, where Paige and those guys were in
[02:14:29.080 --> 02:14:33.480]  basically devotees of Alistair Crowley, and Alistair Crowley is the premier black magician
[02:14:33.480 --> 02:14:39.160]  of the 20th century, and the Illuminati still actually, I hear, actually conjure Crowley
[02:14:39.160 --> 02:14:44.760]  because he's a demon, apparently, on some other dimension, so they try to invoke him
[02:14:44.760 --> 02:14:45.760]  in their rituals.
[02:14:45.760 --> 02:14:48.160]  But the point is, it's about energy.
[02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:49.160]  Where does your energy go?
[02:14:49.160 --> 02:14:52.840]  And so, for the pure spirit of Islam, just like the pure spirit of Christianity, the
[02:14:52.840 --> 02:14:57.280]  pure spirit of Judaism, the idea is your energy is supposed to go to the one God, the creator,
[02:14:57.280 --> 02:15:00.360]  and you are made in his likeness, and we are all made in the likeness of God, so we should
[02:15:00.360 --> 02:15:05.280]  respect each other as being made in the image of God, the representatives of God.
[02:15:05.280 --> 02:15:12.080]  But if we then, ultimately, if we then go towards worshiping people, idols, and serving
[02:15:12.080 --> 02:15:16.240]  them through our monetary system, paying homage through our money, our energy is going to
[02:15:16.240 --> 02:15:17.240]  that.
[02:15:17.240 --> 02:15:20.000]  We become materialistic, hedonistic, and ego-worship.
[02:15:20.000 --> 02:15:22.840]  And they are truly false gods, haven't they?
[02:15:22.840 --> 02:15:27.440]  You know, where is the resistance, you know, where is the resistance against?
[02:15:27.440 --> 02:15:31.400]  Okay, I, his Skype just cut out.
[02:15:31.400 --> 02:15:33.320]  Let's reconnect with him right now.
[02:15:33.320 --> 02:15:34.320]  Thank you.
[02:15:34.320 --> 02:15:40.880]  Skype is an incredible thing, better audio, video, for another dimension of information
[02:15:40.880 --> 02:15:44.200]  here, but it still is not perfect.
[02:15:44.200 --> 02:15:47.000]  That's why we couldn't use it three, four years ago.
[02:15:47.000 --> 02:15:50.520]  It was way too sketchy then, now it's getting really, really good.
[02:15:50.520 --> 02:15:55.360]  But I was going to get into false gods with him, and see people think false gods, that's
[02:15:55.360 --> 02:15:56.360]  the stuff in the Bible.
[02:15:56.360 --> 02:15:58.560]  It's mind control.
[02:15:58.560 --> 02:16:06.640]  They learned how to manipulate people through images, and then people can attach a message
[02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:12.120]  to their false god, Madonna, Angelina Jolie, Arnold Schwarzenegger, whatever it is, and
[02:16:12.120 --> 02:16:16.800]  then people will basically go along with that because of the image of the idol.
[02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:21.960]  It really is just a narcissistic star who is just reading off a script or a teleprompter.
[02:16:21.960 --> 02:16:27.160]  That's why I point out, my radio show, my TV show, teleprompter free.
[02:16:27.160 --> 02:16:28.160]  Teleprompter free.
[02:16:28.160 --> 02:16:30.400]  I mean, sometimes I have a TV screen where I can see the video of who I'm interviewing
[02:16:30.400 --> 02:16:34.320]  or when they bring up a new article, I can know that, okay, we're covering that article.
[02:16:34.320 --> 02:16:38.800]  But you know what my words are versus when I say, let's read from this article.
[02:16:38.800 --> 02:16:44.160]  Because what you're hearing is what I've researched, what I stand for, what I believe in.
[02:16:44.160 --> 02:16:48.440]  You're absolutely right, and Sean, people say, well, this is old mumbo jumbo.
[02:16:48.440 --> 02:16:52.480]  We're the 21st century atheists, I don't want to hear about God, I don't believe in it.
[02:16:52.480 --> 02:16:57.000]  The point is the elites do, and they're using it as a science of control.
[02:16:57.000 --> 02:17:01.480]  Maybe it is just an archetypal, you could say the atheists, I don't agree with this,
[02:17:01.480 --> 02:17:04.560]  system of primitive programming of the brain.
[02:17:04.560 --> 02:17:06.680]  The point is, it works.
[02:17:06.680 --> 02:17:07.680]  It works.
[02:17:07.680 --> 02:17:08.680]  It's real.
[02:17:08.680 --> 02:17:13.040]  It's a thousand heroes, a thousand devils, a thousand good guys, a thousand bad guys.
[02:17:13.040 --> 02:17:15.120]  It's the hero of a thousand faces.
[02:17:15.120 --> 02:17:18.960]  It is Jungian psychology, whatever you want to call it.
[02:17:18.960 --> 02:17:21.560]  The elites are obsessed with it.
[02:17:21.560 --> 02:17:23.040]  You know more of the elite than I do.
[02:17:23.040 --> 02:17:24.040]  They're really into the occult.
[02:17:24.040 --> 02:17:27.760]  I mean, I know you can't get all the way into it, but have you ever run into the Illuminati,
[02:17:27.760 --> 02:17:28.760]  Sean?
[02:17:28.760 --> 02:17:37.160]  I'm very close to some people who have and who are involved in some level.
[02:17:37.160 --> 02:17:42.960]  And this is a long exploration, frankly, it's going to take some time to elaborate,
[02:17:42.960 --> 02:17:46.240]  but there are basically the eyes wide shut sex parties are real.
[02:17:46.240 --> 02:17:47.240]  These things take place.
[02:17:47.240 --> 02:17:51.040]  They do have these crystal skull type of things that they, you know, like in the Indiana
[02:17:51.040 --> 02:17:52.720]  Jones film, they had the crystal skull.
[02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:56.680]  They have these type of skulls they set up at the parties and they feed the energy into
[02:17:56.680 --> 02:17:57.680]  those skulls.
[02:17:57.680 --> 02:18:02.520]  There's a tremendous amount of stuff I'm actually working on in Iran, studying what's
[02:18:02.520 --> 02:18:07.520]  called the Jinn, because that's in Islam, they call them the Jinn in the West, we call
[02:18:07.520 --> 02:18:08.920]  them genies, right?
[02:18:08.920 --> 02:18:12.640]  The point is in Quran, they say the Jinn were created by God in the beginning when they
[02:18:12.640 --> 02:18:16.480]  created angels, humans and Jinn.
[02:18:16.480 --> 02:18:20.120]  And in the old days, they said the Jinn and the humans and angels were more interactive
[02:18:20.120 --> 02:18:24.080]  before the last fall, before the last flood, from Noah's flood.
[02:18:24.080 --> 02:18:27.080]  And after that, the Jinn apparently entered a different dimension.
[02:18:27.080 --> 02:18:30.600]  And from here, there are positive Jinn, negative Jinn, they're positive Jinn who actually worship
[02:18:30.600 --> 02:18:36.320]  God and there are negative Jinn who were like the Nephilim in the Old Testament and in Genesis
[02:18:36.320 --> 02:18:37.840]  and Ezekiel.
[02:18:37.840 --> 02:18:40.800]  Similar exactly the fallen angels concept.
[02:18:40.800 --> 02:18:45.040]  The point is the Jinn are very interesting for Freemasons, because the Jinn were involved
[02:18:45.040 --> 02:18:46.880]  in constructing Solomon's temple.
[02:18:46.880 --> 02:18:48.520]  King Solomon was able to command them.
[02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:53.200]  He had a ring of power, which is a five-sided pentagram, which is why the pentagram symbol
[02:18:53.200 --> 02:18:58.160]  is key for most satanic or black magic ceremonies.
[02:18:58.160 --> 02:19:02.940]  You can then conjure Jinn, but Solomon used them for wisdom and to command them and basically
[02:19:02.940 --> 02:19:07.280]  use them to build the temple and to honor God as opposed to what many of you know.
[02:19:07.280 --> 02:19:10.800]  Now you're giving out the big Mason secrets that higher-level Masons are taught.
[02:19:10.800 --> 02:19:15.280]  Whether it's real or not, this is what 33rd degree Masons, 32-degree Masons are taught.
[02:19:15.280 --> 02:19:19.520]  Yeah, and it's known outside of Masonic circles.
[02:19:19.520 --> 02:19:25.720]  But the point is that the idea of the Illuminati, and this is known in the West, in the East
[02:19:25.720 --> 02:19:26.720]  as well.
[02:19:26.720 --> 02:19:29.840]  In Iran, in China, people have talked to you from the mystical sects, from the Sufis and
[02:19:29.840 --> 02:19:30.840]  other mystical sects.
[02:19:30.840 --> 02:19:33.720]  Know about these things that you can make, that first of all, there's six dimensions
[02:19:33.720 --> 02:19:39.480]  of perception, which is why the star of David, which is actually not David's star, precedes
[02:19:39.480 --> 02:19:40.480]  it.
[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:41.480]  It goes back to Babylon.
[02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:42.480]  It's very important because it shows six sides.
[02:19:42.480 --> 02:19:48.120]  Yeah, it's the key seal, in fact, it's the seal on the ring to command the creatures.
[02:19:48.120 --> 02:19:52.360]  Whether it's real or not, well, stay there, we're going to come back and talk with you
[02:19:52.360 --> 02:19:53.360]  on the other side.
[02:19:53.360 --> 02:19:55.160]  It was Solomon's key, right?
[02:19:55.160 --> 02:20:00.800]  And we're going to come back and discuss all this and your recognition of Islam.
[02:20:00.800 --> 02:20:05.640]  Do you know which 37 crucial food items are going to fly off the shelves when the next
[02:20:05.640 --> 02:20:06.640]  disaster hits?
[02:20:06.640 --> 02:20:11.560]  If you don't, you and your family may be without food and waiting in long food lines after
[02:20:11.560 --> 02:20:13.240]  a big disaster strikes.
[02:20:13.240 --> 02:20:17.280]  You would be surprised how many people don't have these food items right now.
[02:20:17.280 --> 02:20:23.480]  123survivalplan.com has set up a for patriots only video with inside information on the

[02:24:04.840 --> 02:24:13.840]  Alright Sean Stone director TV host and over 100 films is our guest and in the next few
[02:24:13.840 --> 02:24:17.640]  months they should be launching they don't have the air dates yet the new show conspiracy
[02:24:17.640 --> 02:24:21.240]  theory the third season with Jesse Ventura.
[02:24:21.240 --> 02:24:26.800]  Now this is a short segment long segment coming up you were getting into Solomon's Temple
[02:24:26.800 --> 02:24:29.280]  when the break interrupted you please continue.
[02:24:29.280 --> 02:24:35.960]  Yeah so what I meant to say was that with the star of David the six-sided as opposed
[02:24:35.960 --> 02:24:41.000]  to Solomon's which is five well they're different since five-sided star is used for commending
[02:24:41.000 --> 02:24:46.840]  Jinn and so when you go to the east in Iran for example I've been talking to Jinn masters
[02:24:46.840 --> 02:24:51.920]  and they describe how what happens is you basically conjure a Jinn and you make deals
[02:24:51.920 --> 02:24:58.640]  with them and that's the essence of the black magic Illuminati rituals that we've uncovered
[02:24:58.640 --> 02:25:02.760]  or that we're aware of and so they basically make these deals with these which you call
[02:25:02.760 --> 02:25:07.640]  demon fallen angel types and they have to make sacrifice so the point is that in order to
[02:25:07.640 --> 02:25:13.840]  let's say have the power that they enjoy to let's say you know have control over music
[02:25:13.840 --> 02:25:20.040]  industry finance you know they want to control the Middle East they have to then make a deal
[02:25:20.040 --> 02:25:24.480]  and some kind of sacrifice in exchange a blood sacrifice that's where the sacrifice of children
[02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:28.160]  comes in the sacrifice of soldiers and war and what's interesting about the Jinn is that
[02:25:28.160 --> 02:25:32.560]  they always respond to symbol signs and symbols so the for example the pyramid of the triangle
[02:25:32.560 --> 02:25:38.160]  shape of the pyramid is one the five-sided star the six-sided star each one has different
[02:25:38.160 --> 02:25:42.800]  meaning for them but they congregate around those signs which is why you find that most
[02:25:42.800 --> 02:25:48.560]  of the major corporate symbols have some so-called Illuminati symbol it incorporated into it
[02:25:48.560 --> 02:25:53.880]  right and that then gives an energy by which the Jinn whenever you wear that symbol let's
[02:25:53.880 --> 02:25:58.880]  say on your on your clothes you're giving energy to that to that to that power that power
[02:25:58.880 --> 02:26:02.280]  over you and again if you're a new listener and you're like this sounds crazy whether
[02:26:02.280 --> 02:26:07.520]  it's real or not the elite really do believe in this I mean that's come out so many times
[02:26:07.520 --> 02:26:11.760]  when I was in Bohemian Grove they were taking it all deadly serious why do you think most
[02:26:11.760 --> 02:26:15.280]  of the globalists are so obsessed with the pyramid because you know they use lots of
[02:26:15.280 --> 02:26:21.480]  other symbols but they love that pyramid they do love the pyramid have you seen this
[02:26:21.480 --> 02:26:25.760]  Coney 2012 campaign that's being run it's an upside down pyramid which an upside down
[02:26:25.760 --> 02:26:29.560]  pyramid and it's like the inversion of the Obama campaign we are hope we are changed
[02:26:29.560 --> 02:26:33.440]  and they put the same like they put Coney as his picture just like they put Obama's
[02:26:33.440 --> 02:26:38.440]  picture four years ago I noticed that they even use that same Soviet style colors but
[02:26:38.440 --> 02:26:45.040]  then putting by Hitler exactly it's like Obama and the you and her good and Coney is bad
[02:26:45.040 --> 02:26:49.240]  and what's your view on that and Angelina Joe Lee because I found she's at the heart
[02:26:49.240 --> 02:26:55.600]  of all these wars well I mean I will comment on her specifically what I'll say is the United
[02:26:55.600 --> 02:27:03.000]  Nations is a giant occult location and base I've heard from multiple people about rituals
[02:27:03.000 --> 02:27:06.680]  taking place underground including a guy in Iran who just went to school at Columbia and
[02:27:06.680 --> 02:27:11.480]  he saw a spiritist seance taking place in one of the rooms he was invited to 30 years
[02:27:11.480 --> 02:27:16.960]  ago in like 79 no they admittedly have weird religious rooms they keep locked up that dignitaries
[02:27:16.960 --> 02:27:23.280]  go into yeah in fact isn't there the black cobble the cobblestone see in Islam the cobblestone
[02:27:23.280 --> 02:27:28.520]  is very sacred in in Mecca and they because the black stone of the cover they say fell
[02:27:28.520 --> 02:27:35.400]  to earth from heaven and frankly resembles a little bit the 2001 obelisk that Kubrick
[02:27:35.400 --> 02:27:39.680]  intimated was involved in the creation of consciousness on earth yeah when that when
[02:27:39.680 --> 02:27:46.400]  that black stone falls to earth that launches the step from from animal to man right because
[02:27:46.400 --> 02:27:50.880]  consciousness is now it basically consciousness is this which we cannot describe what is it
[02:27:50.880 --> 02:27:54.920]  that makes consciousness you know what is why is it the human consciousness is a different
[02:27:54.920 --> 02:28:00.280]  level than that of an animal you were getting into the six senses the six yeah the sixth
[02:28:00.280 --> 02:28:07.760]  sense right beyond the five the spirit being the fifth but what is the sixth right so the
[02:28:07.760 --> 02:28:12.920]  point is that when it comes to that that black stone at the Kaaba this is a sacred stone but
[02:28:12.920 --> 02:28:17.440]  they have a similar imitation imitation of it I believe in the United Nations you know
[02:28:17.440 --> 02:28:24.000]  so there's so much the Queen of England believes she's sworn in on the a holy stone that they
[02:28:24.000 --> 02:28:29.960]  drug back yeah that's the stone that they almost sacrificed Abraham almost sacrificed
[02:28:29.960 --> 02:28:35.040]  his son on that's admitted that and that they really think they're Merovingians that's actually
[02:28:35.040 --> 02:28:39.880]  main line yeah in fact doesn't she sit on top of a stone like that yes he's sworn in
[02:28:39.880 --> 02:28:44.960]  she's coronated on it right under her throne but I was also told by the gin masters that
[02:28:44.960 --> 02:28:50.000]  she commands the gin through the stones in her crown because it said the crown actually
[02:28:50.000 --> 02:28:55.400]  is like an antenna and the stones this is the stones that she that are put into her crown
[02:28:55.400 --> 02:29:00.520]  those are basically how you say their base gin basically congregate like I said around
[02:29:00.520 --> 02:29:03.960]  certain signs symbols stones because it has to with energy that goes back to the lore of
[02:29:03.960 --> 02:29:07.720]  the dragon wants a big pile of gold and silver because the more diamonds and gold they have
[02:29:07.720 --> 02:29:12.360]  the bigger the resonance yeah well the whole gold issues you get into Ben Fulford and David
[02:29:12.360 --> 02:29:17.440]  Wilcox and what they've been investigating regarding this fraudulent transit trends
[02:29:17.440 --> 02:29:22.120]  transactions of gold the fact that the Chinese are owed tremendous billions of dollars of
[02:29:22.120 --> 02:29:28.000]  gold if not more they're trying to reclaim it and every time they do the US IRS and what
[02:29:28.000 --> 02:29:32.360]  not basically alleges that those are fraudulent notes that they're holding so they won't they
[02:29:32.360 --> 02:29:36.360]  won't actually return the gold or pay the pay the debt that's owed so there's actually
[02:29:36.360 --> 02:29:39.960]  huge lawsuits that are taking place have you heard about this from Fulford and company
[02:29:39.960 --> 02:29:44.200]  all right we're gonna be right back we'll get more into that and again folks whether
[02:29:44.200 --> 02:29:48.920]  you believe in this or not the elite are obsessed with it so they're running the world according
[02:29:48.920 --> 02:29:55.480]  to these occult systems we're on the march the empires on the run Alex Jones and the
[02:29:55.480 --> 02:30:05.720]  GCN radio network a little over a year ago I began to do a lot of research into why even
[02:30:05.720 --> 02:30:09.720]  if I had a pretty good size meal that I was still starving and my research led me to a
[02:30:09.720 --> 02:30:14.520]  well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States
[02:30:14.520 --> 02:30:19.920]  and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key

[02:32:12.880 --> 02:32:17.360]  power your electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[02:32:17.360 --> 02:32:22.640]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[02:32:22.640 --> 02:32:27.960]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[02:32:27.960 --> 02:32:32.760]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids
[02:32:32.760 --> 02:32:37.260]  every year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number five
[02:32:37.260 --> 02:32:41.720]  a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[02:32:41.720 --> 02:32:45.360]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from science one of my

[02:32:55.960 --> 02:33:19.740]  dot com or call 1-877-327-0365 look just as an anthropologist just as a sociologist
[02:33:19.740 --> 02:33:24.720]  this is somebody who looks at civilization and current and past cultures humans are
[02:33:24.720 --> 02:33:30.240]  obsessed with the occult and every elite that ends up getting in power in every culture
[02:33:30.240 --> 02:33:35.640]  builds pyramids and chops their children's hearts out and drinks their blood the druids
[02:33:35.640 --> 02:33:41.400]  the Aztecs the the the Romans did rituals but it's all the Greeks did human sacrifice
[02:33:41.400 --> 02:33:49.160]  but it's like a footnote every culture has done it until you see the worship of the one
[02:33:49.160 --> 02:33:57.600]  god and even if you're an atheist or whatever I mean do atheists send me emails when I talk
[02:33:57.600 --> 02:34:02.280]  about pygmies were being animus and worshiping plants and animals and so I don't believe
[02:34:02.280 --> 02:34:07.320]  in God don't tell me about pygmies beliefs the point is the pygmies are worshiping plants
[02:34:07.320 --> 02:34:14.800]  and animals if you look at it from an anthropology or sociology or archaeology angle and the
[02:34:14.800 --> 02:34:20.480]  globalists the people that have got 400 plus reactors 90% of them leaking that are genetically
[02:34:20.480 --> 02:34:25.720]  engineering everything thinking they're God they are out of their minds power trips they
[02:34:25.720 --> 02:34:32.000]  believe they're establishing world government they're setting it up they're in control and
[02:34:32.000 --> 02:34:39.080]  they're crazy but they are in control what do you make Sean of the fact or maybe you
[02:34:39.080 --> 02:34:43.840]  disagree that the globalist are endangering the planet while lecturing us that they want
[02:34:43.840 --> 02:34:49.280]  to kill everybody to save it I mean what do you make of where they're taking us and who
[02:34:49.280 --> 02:34:57.600]  do the elite from your research into the Illuminati where do they think this is all going I think
[02:34:57.600 --> 02:35:02.840]  we've hit this this 2012 pretty hard and it's a fascinating time from the point of view of
[02:35:02.840 --> 02:35:07.320]  consciousness there's a there's a new awareness I think on the scale of global consciousness
[02:35:07.320 --> 02:35:11.760]  from people the fact that we can communicate across the world through cell phones and internet
[02:35:11.760 --> 02:35:17.520]  from anywhere from Africa to America they're trying to guide this to destroy nation states
[02:35:17.520 --> 02:35:22.200]  and actually that's that's why when I came back I took the stand you know on Iran saying
[02:35:22.200 --> 02:35:26.000]  leave them alone they have the right to nuclear power including weaponry if need be but the
[02:35:26.000 --> 02:35:30.120]  point is that they are in a sovereign nation the idea globe the agenda that we've known
[02:35:30.120 --> 02:35:35.520]  for over 100 years of the of the high level masons and the especially the British elite
[02:35:35.520 --> 02:35:41.960]  the British monarchy has been to continue the empire through informal means right they
[02:35:41.960 --> 02:35:45.800]  could they couldn't continue the empire through manpower they don't have enough British troops
[02:35:45.800 --> 02:35:50.280]  on the ground across the world so what they wanted was ideology finance control through
[02:35:50.280 --> 02:35:55.520]  IMF roundtable groups roundtable groups and then of course the idea ultimately that no
[02:35:55.520 --> 02:35:59.480]  nation is sovereign they hate nation states because the idea of a nation state the tree
[02:35:59.480 --> 02:36:03.960]  of Westphalia system going back to the late 17th century it's 17th century sure which
[02:36:03.960 --> 02:36:08.720]  is which allowed for our country to exist you know based on that same principle is that
[02:36:08.720 --> 02:36:12.120]  you know a country is sovereign within its borders it has the right to develop itself
[02:36:12.120 --> 02:36:16.360]  you know according to its constitution according to its people's will and they say no it's
[02:36:16.360 --> 02:36:18.960]  not according to your people's will it's going to be according to our will we're going to
[02:36:18.960 --> 02:36:22.760]  we're going to blow your your country up we're going to blow up notice it's a corporate model
[02:36:22.760 --> 02:36:27.400]  just like the British East India Company ran India for hundreds of years it was a private
[02:36:27.400 --> 02:36:32.320]  corporation that's all globalism is is there exempt from the rules we're all under this
[02:36:32.320 --> 02:36:38.160]  yoke of tyranny and now under Obama they're launching all these peace wars how do you
[02:36:38.160 --> 02:36:42.760]  think things are going for the global controllers well they're in desperate trouble I mean that's
[02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:46.560]  what I'm saying read Ben Fulford's work on this gold issue because they're they're they're
[02:36:46.560 --> 02:36:50.000]  some serious it's called the cation lawsuit these guys are seen it from Chinese side or
[02:36:50.000 --> 02:36:54.880]  said the so-called dragon family are suing the globalists to get their gold back because
[02:36:54.880 --> 02:36:58.840]  the point is that there's so much gold it's been hoarded by the Federal Reserve Bank the
[02:36:58.840 --> 02:37:03.960]  Rothschild family these these Western Illuminati families basically have been stealing gold
[02:37:03.960 --> 02:37:07.680]  and now through legal means that the Chinese and others actually trying to what we call
[02:37:07.680 --> 02:37:12.800]  the white dragon or the sort of the white hat faction are trying to get accountability
[02:37:12.800 --> 02:37:18.040]  for this gold did you notice that Chavez has demanded his gold good because what happens
[02:37:18.040 --> 02:37:21.640]  is these countries see something the point is that when we when we invade Iraq when we
[02:37:21.640 --> 02:37:26.160]  in the British invade Libya and Iraq and these countries we're stealing the gold that's what's
[02:37:26.160 --> 02:37:30.280]  being looted in the process you know and you're also doing control disintegration project
[02:37:30.280 --> 02:37:34.240]  where you're arming the various sides so of course you know this the financier leaders
[02:37:34.240 --> 02:37:38.440]  is always profiting from from financing both sides and creating so-called this control
[02:37:38.440 --> 02:37:43.240]  disintegration if you can't control the system they then have a policy which is control disintegration
[02:37:43.240 --> 02:37:47.760]  of that system and you try to control the rate of decline and the then you know by smashing
[02:37:47.760 --> 02:37:52.280]  it you basically when the Rockefeller Empire was smashed and as opposed to one old one
[02:37:52.280 --> 02:37:57.040]  consolidated power they then had control of like 20 different companies now it's a hydro
[02:37:57.040 --> 02:38:01.800]  which can even hide better and create monopolies that are even more powerful I mean I mean they
[02:38:01.800 --> 02:38:07.240]  they say the Rothschilds are obsessed with hiding the fact that they've got trillions
[02:38:07.240 --> 02:38:12.600]  in in in different loot and I agree with you things are not going well for the globalist
[02:38:12.600 --> 02:38:16.720]  but that's what's so dangerous is that they're going to blow it up they want World War three
[02:38:16.720 --> 02:38:22.880]  I mean the point about Iran is Russia is as the last the last nation is actually protecting
[02:38:22.880 --> 02:38:26.200]  sovereign nation states this point when Putin said that you know you're facing a cult of
[02:38:26.200 --> 02:38:30.680]  violence he's he's saying that because he knows how insane Obama is and his controllers
[02:38:30.680 --> 02:38:35.000]  is British masters and actually the Jin people told me that Obama answers directly to the
[02:38:35.000 --> 02:38:39.160]  queen and there's indications they said from the way that he behaved when he went to meet
[02:38:39.160 --> 02:38:43.920]  her that she is basically his psychic sorcerer let's call her controller because historically
[02:38:43.920 --> 02:38:47.840]  the Illuminati have a ruler and then they have some kind of Merlin figure a sorcerer
[02:38:47.840 --> 02:38:52.760]  who's involved in protecting them psychically and conjuring Jin and conjuring the demonic
[02:38:52.760 --> 02:38:56.760]  powers by which they can rule so apparently the relationship of Obama to the queen is
[02:38:56.760 --> 02:39:01.760]  is exactly that all right so puppet all right I want to be clear here we can prove that
[02:39:01.760 --> 02:39:06.800]  in this this reality that that the British royalty the Rothschilds are Rockefellers
[02:39:06.800 --> 02:39:10.520]  they want world government eugenics I have their own documents that's crazy enough people
[02:39:10.520 --> 02:39:14.640]  can't believe it I've never seen these things you're talking about I know the elites believe
[02:39:14.640 --> 02:39:19.600]  in them and are very serious about it but but Sean I've met you a few times in person
[02:39:19.600 --> 02:39:25.160]  talk to you on the phone had you on the show you come across as a nice person who believes
[02:39:25.160 --> 02:39:29.600]  what they're saying and you come across as an intelligent person and of course you have
[02:39:29.600 --> 02:39:35.040]  a very famous father and then you're here on air you know saying you've recognized Islam
[02:39:35.040 --> 02:39:39.800]  and that you're communicating with entities called genies I mean I would be remiss if
[02:39:39.800 --> 02:39:45.040]  I didn't say you know come on are you do I mean is this some kind of elaborate Psyop
[02:39:45.040 --> 02:39:50.760]  or I mean or is this real things that have happened to you and then why are you saying
[02:39:50.760 --> 02:39:55.720]  these things on air even if they're true are you worried about being attacked no I'm not
[02:39:55.720 --> 02:40:00.680]  saying that I personally communicate with genies I mean I may have I've received phone
[02:40:00.680 --> 02:40:06.080]  calls and communications from people could be sorcerers frankly I mean I'm not entirely
[02:40:06.080 --> 02:40:12.000]  clear of how what level of operation they're involved with but I mean without the CIA O&I
[02:40:12.000 --> 02:40:15.880]  you know the part the defense the DIA I mean there's there's many different agencies that
[02:40:15.880 --> 02:40:20.760]  can be involved in this and that are monitoring me this I know even you know the fact is that
[02:40:20.760 --> 02:40:26.080]  I was told about the strike in New York everyone New York and Virginia were hit in August to
[02:40:26.080 --> 02:40:31.520]  August 23rd of last year I was told I was called on June 29th and told 55 days till
[02:40:31.520 --> 02:40:36.160]  blackout and this is one of those and this is one of those people that I don't know exactly
[02:40:36.160 --> 02:40:39.360]  who he is never taught I've never seen him face-to-face I've only received phone calls
[02:40:39.360 --> 02:40:43.560]  and I'm not sure if he's which intelligence agency works with I'm not sure who he you
[02:40:43.560 --> 02:40:48.480]  know what faction he's for but he told me 55 days till blackout 55 days later Virginia
[02:40:48.480 --> 02:40:53.760]  got the earthquake New York followed the same week that's not that a storm hit you know
[02:40:53.760 --> 02:40:57.560]  a tsunami hit New York I mean this is insane let me stop you right there let me stop you
[02:40:57.560 --> 02:41:01.440]  right there because you know when I've talked to you personally and you know when we've
[02:41:01.440 --> 02:41:05.280]  hung out and you know worked on the TV show I don't bring up the questions that everybody
[02:41:05.280 --> 02:41:10.080]  I know constantly brings up but you know here's your father one of the most famous directors
[02:41:10.080 --> 02:41:15.640]  in history and I've got to ask you what does he what does he think about all the things
[02:41:15.640 --> 02:41:22.880]  you're doing or is that private there's you know you speak with a lot of people around
[02:41:22.880 --> 02:41:28.040]  the film business there's awareness of the spiritist realm there's a level of there's
[02:41:28.040 --> 02:41:34.400]  a very strong spiritual realm spiritual awareness he's someone that has gone through that I
[02:41:34.400 --> 02:41:38.760]  mean you can see it in the doors you can see his relationship to Buddhism that follows
[02:41:38.760 --> 02:41:43.600]  with heaven and earth and other films he's aware of demons he's very aware of these
[02:41:43.600 --> 02:41:48.400]  things ultimately does he believe in this what I'm talking about I don't know I would
[02:41:48.400 --> 02:41:52.360]  say that's a long conversation and frankly you know there's things that he will say in
[02:41:52.360 --> 02:41:55.480]  the movie won't say the same with Steven Spielberg or any of these people you know if you think
[02:41:55.480 --> 02:41:59.720]  about it why are they making movie why is he Spielberg making movies about aliens so much
[02:41:59.720 --> 02:42:07.720]  and you know we know why why does Hollywood propagate certain stories you know alien invasions
[02:42:07.720 --> 02:42:12.920]  blackouts sure there's a lot we don't know and that's what the occult's all about well
[02:42:12.920 --> 02:42:17.680]  let me put it to you this way you told me some stuff that fits in with information I've
[02:42:17.680 --> 02:42:22.400]  gotten from separate people that are at your level of connections and things I've personally
[02:42:22.400 --> 02:42:27.120]  witnessed growing up in Dallas and then also Bohemian Grove so experiences I've had and
[02:42:27.120 --> 02:42:30.440]  at the time you didn't say this is off record don't say anything but later I said hey I'm
[02:42:30.440 --> 02:42:34.320]  going to bring this up you said no no no I mean when are you going to talk about the
[02:42:34.320 --> 02:42:40.520]  things that you know about the Illuminati I think that'll come out in the course of
[02:42:40.520 --> 02:42:43.560]  the next year if we can do a documentary on this stuff and actually document it I mean
[02:42:43.560 --> 02:42:47.880]  I've seen photographs I've seen photographs of some of the rituals beyond what you did
[02:42:47.880 --> 02:42:53.200]  I mean actual like you know estates private estates where the cloaks are on it looks like
[02:42:53.200 --> 02:42:58.240]  you know eyes wide shut Sean you haven't just seen photographs right I mean you've got some
[02:42:58.240 --> 02:43:05.400]  other sources here I have other sources I've never been invited I'm hoping to all right
[02:43:05.400 --> 02:43:18.200]  all right but man I tell you what all right whatever that you know we're trying to investigate
[02:43:18.200 --> 02:43:23.840]  this stuff and take and actually document as clearly as possible on camera what's going
[02:43:23.840 --> 02:43:27.560]  on this is you know but it's very serious to these people and they you know are not
[02:43:27.560 --> 02:43:32.120]  they have killed in the past to quiet it and make sure that people don't know the truth
[02:43:32.120 --> 02:43:36.840]  but I think that this is 2012 2013 this is the time for look at what happened to Kubrick
[02:43:36.840 --> 02:43:41.600]  he they did cut 24 minutes of that film he refused to cut it and died the day he refused
[02:43:41.600 --> 02:43:47.960]  because he had final cut then they cut it and released it yeah I can tell you one thing
[02:43:47.960 --> 02:43:54.400]  my friend Alex was on the show with you last time he saw lights in the sky over where was
[02:43:54.400 --> 02:43:59.040]  it it was it was off the coast of Jersey and a bunch of crazy stuff just happening in Phoenix
[02:43:59.040 --> 02:44:03.080]  but go ahead this was this was actually when Occupy Wall Street had been shut the number
[02:44:03.080 --> 02:44:07.000]  of the week that Occupy Wall Street in New York they shut down Zikati Park and then that
[02:44:07.000 --> 02:44:11.280]  week then they returned to the bridge well the night they shut it down there was serious
[02:44:11.280 --> 02:44:16.800]  activity in the sky on the coast of Jersey right across from New York upstate it's like
[02:44:16.800 --> 02:44:22.320]  the Pacific highway there and the point is that there's a whole town that got shut down
[02:44:22.320 --> 02:44:27.440]  actually the cops bar blocked everyone all traffic entering this area Nyak I think it
[02:44:27.440 --> 02:44:31.720]  was like Nyak New Jersey so they they block or is it New York Nyak New York but the point
[02:44:31.720 --> 02:44:35.640]  is that they block this whole town and Alex was on was checking it out because he's like
[02:44:35.640 --> 02:44:39.280]  why is there so much going down oh they said that there was a power outage or something
[02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:43.240]  but no one was allowed to go to their homes no one could even enter well he saw a couple
[02:44:43.240 --> 02:44:48.920]  things in the sky and next thing he knows he's taken in by men in black from basically
[02:44:48.920 --> 02:44:52.480]  arrest them in the woods where he's fine where he sees this he's thrown into Greystone mental
[02:44:52.480 --> 02:44:56.840]  hospital for a night he then you know his drug he calls me from the hospital he's like
[02:44:56.840 --> 02:45:00.200]  trying to get out and he's but he's drugged out of his mind I just tell him okay just
[02:45:00.200 --> 02:45:04.720]  sleep it off wake up in the morning he gets out he can't get any records they deny that
[02:45:04.720 --> 02:45:08.880]  he was ever there this is how these guys operate you understand and they try to think build
[02:45:08.880 --> 02:45:12.520]  a case it's why a lot of people who ultimately are around Illuminati people like Arizona
[02:45:12.520 --> 02:45:15.960]  Wild and others they end up at mental hospitals because they get forced into it and the point
[02:45:15.960 --> 02:45:19.440]  is once you're there well then they use the mental hospital as the cover that came out
[02:45:19.440 --> 02:45:24.160]  with Ewing Cameron thousands of school children they would kidnap this is on history channel
[02:45:24.160 --> 02:45:28.760]  in Virginia and up over the border in Canada and they would actually create mind control
[02:45:28.760 --> 02:45:33.600]  slaves this is declassified and they would run it out of mental hospitals right exactly
[02:45:33.600 --> 02:45:37.920]  in fact my friend was telling me last night how the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt is run
[02:45:37.920 --> 02:45:42.320]  by two of the two of the head guys there were our psychiatrist trained from Tavistock in
[02:45:42.320 --> 02:45:47.200]  England right so what they'll do is they'll basically they'll have you go to prisons and
[02:45:47.200 --> 02:45:50.720]  you know around these countries in Egypt or Israel wherever it may be and they'll basically
[02:45:50.720 --> 02:45:56.160]  start to psychically psychologically analyze the profile of the prisoners there and decide
[02:45:56.160 --> 02:46:02.000]  who's useful to be you know a candidate for extremism for terrorism for murder and that's
[02:46:02.000 --> 02:46:06.480]  how they recruit people you know no no no I knew this eight years ago but now it's been
[02:46:06.480 --> 02:46:11.800]  admitted you're absolutely right they have the real camper x-ray at Guantanamo within
[02:46:11.800 --> 02:46:18.600]  the base army and CIA psychiatrist run it and that's why all the new Alcatel leadership
[02:46:18.600 --> 02:46:25.680]  are picked up as 1415 16 there taken tortured trained and then released and then they command
[02:46:25.680 --> 02:46:34.640]  the new Al Qaeda right that's why the leader of Al Qaeda in Syria and the one in Libya
[02:46:34.640 --> 02:46:39.240]  were actually at that base for five or six years apiece you're absolutely right but
[02:46:39.240 --> 02:46:42.800]  it's even admitted that they are in there torturing them and mind controlling them in
[02:46:42.800 --> 02:46:48.360]  there so Guantanamo is actually a terrorist factory exactly that's the whole point it's
[02:46:48.360 --> 02:46:54.720]  all British Cavastock style of operating you basically you profile people you build you
[02:46:54.720 --> 02:46:59.440]  build terrorists you deploy them around the world I mean it's like this you gotta wake
[02:46:59.440 --> 02:47:03.320]  up me people have got to wake up to this fact terrorists are known entities you can you can
[02:47:03.320 --> 02:47:07.560]  go to any city and talk to a police officer they know who the mob guys are they know who
[02:47:07.560 --> 02:47:11.560]  are the most you know the most likely you know the drug dealers are they know the most likely
[02:47:11.560 --> 02:47:15.760]  candidates for murder and crime I mean this is just basic police work so you can tell
[02:47:15.760 --> 02:47:20.960]  me you know Osama bin Laden sitting in Pakistan for for ten years and no even notices we live
[02:47:20.960 --> 02:47:25.560]  in delusion we live in the Wizard of Oz reality and I think people have are waking up step
[02:47:25.560 --> 02:47:30.640]  by step but the big problem Alex is how do you get information across when there's ten
[02:47:30.640 --> 02:47:34.240]  how many millions of websites available for information for traffic and then you get Fox
[02:47:34.240 --> 02:47:38.840]  News and obviously the major news networks who completely cover up any any aspect of
[02:47:38.840 --> 02:47:43.400]  reality and they spin you you know lies but at least online that is available information
[02:47:43.400 --> 02:47:46.840]  but there's just so much out there what do you think the system is going to do that to
[02:47:46.840 --> 02:47:51.240]  try to block out the awakening they're openly wanting to censor now they openly want to
[02:47:51.240 --> 02:47:54.520]  censor the internet and I was told that's what the builder group that decided last year
[02:47:54.520 --> 02:47:58.960]  uh... who was it the famous uh... as to an day lesson I think said that it from the last
[02:47:58.960 --> 02:48:03.960]  build of the conference that was discussed the policy agenda would be to censor the internet
[02:48:03.960 --> 02:48:07.160]  as best they could and then there was obviously this bill that was brought up earlier this
[02:48:07.160 --> 02:48:11.960]  year I'm not sure what happened with it now Jim Tucker said the same thing and then boom
[02:48:11.960 --> 02:48:14.960]  as soon as that conference was over it began in earnest
[02:48:14.960 --> 02:48:21.360]  let me raise this point so it's fair to say the media twisted what you said all you did
[02:48:21.360 --> 02:48:28.000]  was recognize that Islam from its founding from your perspective is worshiping the same
[02:48:28.000 --> 02:48:33.080]  God and we shouldn't have war with each other they spun that like it was a bad thing and
[02:48:33.080 --> 02:48:37.480]  that you would now you know basically got married to Ahmed Denizad
[02:48:37.480 --> 02:48:42.280]  well you know I ultimately ended up becoming his defender when I was simply trying to point
[02:48:42.280 --> 02:48:45.840]  out that he's not a madman you see if you can turn he can turn the president of that
[02:48:45.840 --> 02:48:50.480]  country into a madman he's a mad dictator then it's very then you can't have dialogue
[02:48:50.480 --> 02:48:52.720]  with the guy right you can't have dialogue with that country even though he doesn't
[02:48:52.720 --> 02:48:56.920]  even run the country but aside from that fact you know that he's he's a president within
[02:48:56.920 --> 02:49:00.560]  within a republican structure he doesn't have as much power as our president who's you know
[02:49:00.560 --> 02:49:04.560]  the biggest fascist in the world at this point but I'll get into that in a second
[02:49:04.560 --> 02:49:09.160]  because of the point is that if Ahmed is mad and he's you know he's a warmonger he wants
[02:49:09.160 --> 02:49:12.760]  to destroy Israel we can't talk to him we can't negotiate with him we have to attack
[02:49:12.760 --> 02:49:16.880]  or we have to basically promote the idea of destroying him so I'm basically saying no
[02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:20.640]  these people are rational reasonable people the same thing that actually came out a week
[02:49:20.640 --> 02:49:24.920]  later when the Joint Chief of Staff Chairman comes out and says the same thing Iran is
[02:49:24.920 --> 02:49:29.520]  a rational actor this is you know completely absurd to it's not prudent to bomb Iran I
[02:49:29.520 --> 02:49:33.600]  mean he they've given us all the ammunition now to destroy Obama because Obama is the
[02:49:33.600 --> 02:49:37.760]  guy leading us into this goddamn war the same way that he's put the NDA in place he
[02:49:37.760 --> 02:49:42.240]  asked Carl Levin and the Congress to make sure that U.S. citizens can now be targeted
[02:49:42.240 --> 02:49:46.120]  by our military U.S. citizens can be picked up and detained are we out of our minds what
[02:49:46.120 --> 02:49:50.560]  happened to our country we've destroyed the Constitution blatantly openly and no one says
[02:49:50.560 --> 02:49:51.560]  the thing.
[02:49:51.560 --> 02:49:55.600]  Well I'm glad you raised that we have the NDA passing their passing laws for felonies
[02:49:55.600 --> 02:50:01.360]  of you protest they're openly saying the UN and globalist run war making powers and the
[02:50:01.360 --> 02:50:06.240]  Congress is vestigial I mean this is off the charts off the charts as he's assassinated
[02:50:06.240 --> 02:50:10.400]  American citizens he's deploying drones across the country but more importantly he states
[02:50:10.400 --> 02:50:15.960]  openly U.S. citizens can be detained indefinitely by the military okay destroy due process destroy
[02:50:15.960 --> 02:50:20.720]  habeas corpus that's our constitutional basis right there the U.S. military is going to
[02:50:20.720 --> 02:50:25.520]  be used against our citizens what do you what what they they now have martial law in place
[02:50:25.520 --> 02:50:29.480]  the only question is when they want to use it and to an extent and we basically said
[02:50:29.480 --> 02:50:33.160]  oh because it's Obama and he seems like a smart guy the guy is like salsa doom from
[02:50:33.160 --> 02:50:37.160]  Conan he's a cult leader with a good voice and he knows that hypnotized people that's
[02:50:37.160 --> 02:50:40.640]  the way I look at it and we better get it out of office so we can get another Democratic
[02:50:40.640 --> 02:50:43.760]  candidate because otherwise this guy may not go away it may be more than four years I could
[02:50:43.760 --> 02:50:48.200]  imagine he would if he's been in just shred the Constitution about military arrests who
[02:50:48.200 --> 02:50:52.600]  knows he could become a thinker I've got to say it I mean as bad as Bush was Obama is
[02:50:52.600 --> 02:50:58.280]  even worse I mean he is just totally assassinating the Republic right now we'll break it down
[02:50:58.280 --> 02:51:04.840]  straight ahead with Sean Stone 2012 is finally here and while the government racks up another

[02:54:25.000 --> 02:54:31.680]  things around until you can actually recognize that you have a problem we'll be back tonight
[02:54:31.680 --> 02:54:35.200]  with the nightly news seven o'clock back tomorrow Lord willing we've only got five minutes
[02:54:35.200 --> 02:54:40.360]  left with Sean Stone always great to have him on Sean I never ask you this what's the
[02:54:40.360 --> 02:54:46.480]  best web address or place to go for people to find some of the things you're up to oh
[02:54:46.480 --> 02:54:51.680]  man I got set the website that's all there is to it you know I've been posting all these
[02:54:51.680 --> 02:54:55.880]  interviews and whatnot on Facebook they're obviously on YouTube but I have to consolidate
[02:54:55.880 --> 02:55:00.360]  and now's the time to do it so once I get it up I'll let you know all right we've got
[02:55:00.360 --> 02:55:03.880]  five minutes left so there's so many questions I've got but what are points you'd like to
[02:55:03.880 --> 02:55:09.320]  make before we're out of time I mean the point is that you know we got to avoid this World
[02:55:09.320 --> 02:55:13.160]  War three first of all this is very serious I mean the Russians are not joking when they
[02:55:13.160 --> 02:55:17.520]  say that they don't want to see Iran attacked or the Syrian regime overthrown and we don't
[02:55:17.520 --> 02:55:20.320]  know to what level they'll actually go in terms of putting boots in the ground I mean
[02:55:20.320 --> 02:55:24.760]  don't forget Iran is on their border shares the Caspian Sea with them right and historically
[02:55:24.760 --> 02:55:27.880]  the Russians have been known to intervene whether it be Afghanistan or Georgia when the
[02:55:27.880 --> 02:55:32.600]  West starts to mess around scurron on its border so if you you know if you think that
[02:55:32.600 --> 02:55:37.600]  oh we just gonna we're just gonna bomb Iran it runs a enrichment facilities or whatnot
[02:55:37.600 --> 02:55:41.480]  and get away with it you know first of all Iran's gonna retaliate and we don't know what
[02:55:41.480 --> 02:55:47.120]  capacity whether it be Hezbollah attacking Israel or else you know something abroad but
[02:55:47.120 --> 02:55:50.720]  the point is that they're rational that sense if they're attacked they'll respond and what
[02:55:50.720 --> 02:55:55.520]  will the Russians do will they start launching missiles at you know at the Israelis I mean
[02:55:55.520 --> 02:56:00.240]  I get the I get a feeling that our military is really making a very strong stand here
[02:56:00.240 --> 02:56:05.080]  against Obama because Obama's committed us to backing into a World War three by Obama
[02:56:05.080 --> 02:56:09.560]  saying you know we're unconditionally supporting Israel by giving them bunker busters and other
[02:56:09.560 --> 02:56:16.320]  and very advanced techniques technology for for waging an offensive war against Iran so
[02:56:16.320 --> 02:56:20.600]  basically Obama one you know out of one hand he said we want to talk to Iran the other hand
[02:56:20.600 --> 02:56:23.960]  he's you know he's basically bolstering Israel and apparently cutting deals like you know
[02:56:23.960 --> 02:56:28.800]  saying hold off the attack until after the election but it may not be that long the point
[02:56:28.800 --> 02:56:33.600]  is these guys want it as the as the joint chiefs have said they want it before summer
[02:56:33.600 --> 02:56:38.440]  by about June because by June sandstorm starts to pick up it becomes much more risky in operation
[02:56:38.440 --> 02:56:44.720]  so now three aircraft carriers are massing there people have to understand it's not America
[02:56:44.720 --> 02:56:49.960]  versus Russia the global bankers are playing all these countries off against each other
[02:56:49.960 --> 02:56:54.520]  and they want to sit back and watch us go into debt and use the war as a distraction
[02:56:54.520 --> 02:57:00.280]  from them absorbing the euro and announcing world government exactly exactly that's that's
[02:57:00.280 --> 02:57:04.240]  their next step but the real thing is these guys are lunatics I mean are they going to
[02:57:04.240 --> 02:57:08.080]  prompt a nuclear engagement between the sides because obviously that's what's being looked
[02:57:08.080 --> 02:57:12.280]  at right now I mean the note the Russian military and our military looking at the old mutual
[02:57:12.280 --> 02:57:16.200]  assure destruction scenarios in terms of their in terms of their technologies now obviously
[02:57:16.200 --> 02:57:19.920]  the technologies advance 20 years or more we don't know exactly where we are with these
[02:57:19.920 --> 02:57:24.720]  um like tremendous magnetic pulse weapons things they could wipe out energy grids and
[02:57:24.720 --> 02:57:29.920]  our power but obviously I know that we have martial law it established on this country
[02:57:29.920 --> 02:57:35.160]  so that you know we're basically prepared it seems for some kind of worldwide engagement
[02:57:35.160 --> 02:57:40.200]  and you just hit the key they are building bunkers storing food getting martial law ready
[02:57:40.200 --> 02:57:46.880]  publicly and setting up an architecture for world war three I mean they are again Europe
[02:57:46.880 --> 02:57:52.040]  and in Latin America the Middle East they're not even the primary target we in the west
[02:57:52.040 --> 02:57:56.240]  are the target of this war because again the globalist are outside of us they're playing
[02:57:56.240 --> 02:57:59.960]  us off against each other precisely these guys have no allegiance to America we gotta
[02:57:59.960 --> 02:58:03.720]  stop thinking that this financial faction of Wall Street has anything to do with America
[02:58:03.720 --> 02:58:08.040]  Wall Street is the biggest terrorist we face as American people our enemy is imperialism
[02:58:08.040 --> 02:58:12.560]  we were we are a sovereign republic we believe in in the idea of a republic being sovereign
[02:58:12.560 --> 02:58:17.320]  over its territory over its finance and economics Wall Street has no allegiance to us so why
[02:58:17.320 --> 02:58:19.960]  should we have allegiance to them why are we bailing out these guys who are international
[02:58:19.960 --> 02:58:23.920]  in their nature it's not just that they don't have allegiance as you said Wall Street is
[02:58:23.920 --> 02:58:28.200]  financing getting rid of our republic and our freedom exactly they're the biggest terrorists
[02:58:28.200 --> 02:58:31.960]  we face Wall Street is terrorized more people than Iran ever could in America you know across
[02:58:31.960 --> 02:58:36.400]  the world Sean I want to get you back up next week or even sooner just on Iran because this
[02:58:36.400 --> 02:58:56.080]  is so important just amazing information.
