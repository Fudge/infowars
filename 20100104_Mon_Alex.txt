[00:00.000 --> 00:13.400]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:13.400 --> 00:22.160]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.160 --> 00:31.240]  welcome my friends welcome welcome to the resistance to the new world order the
[00:31.240 --> 00:37.600]  front lines in the info war as we attempt with growing success to rally
[00:37.600 --> 00:43.200]  free humanity against the forces of dehumanizations dehumanization the
[00:43.200 --> 00:50.240]  scientific dictatorship we're gonna be live here for the next four hours today
[00:50.240 --> 00:55.960]  Lord Christopher Moncton will be joining us for a full hour coming up in the
[00:55.960 --> 01:03.560]  next hour to break down Copenhagen in retrospect Gordon Brown's plan even of
[01:03.560 --> 01:07.880]  the nations didn't sign on to have the private IMF and World Bank start
[01:07.880 --> 01:13.560]  monitoring of nations and start taxing of nations even if they didn't sign on how
[01:13.560 --> 01:17.880]  could they do this because the IMF and World Bank already control almost every
[01:17.880 --> 01:22.960]  country on the planet including the United States through fraud we have been
[01:22.960 --> 01:27.680]  boarded we have been commandeered we have been hijacked and when the public
[01:27.680 --> 01:32.800]  realizes this we will defeat the new world order and so it's our job to get
[01:32.800 --> 01:39.560]  that message out to everyone this is our first weekday transmission of 2010
[01:39.560 --> 01:48.200]  thank you so much for joining us tyranny hit home today for me here in Austin
[01:48.200 --> 01:54.480]  Texas and when we come back after this first break I will be going over all of
[01:54.480 --> 02:02.440]  that also gold is rising rapidly again as the dollar begins to fall yet again
[02:02.440 --> 02:07.400]  over a month ago dr. Paul Craig Roberts said that the carry trade a money
[02:07.400 --> 02:15.720]  manipulation a currency manipulation has shifted from China and Japan to the
[02:15.720 --> 02:21.120]  United States and so that as people cashed in on their reverse carry trade
[02:21.120 --> 02:27.240]  that the dollar would buoy in late December it did do that but he predicted
[02:27.240 --> 02:34.440]  that early into 2010 it would begin dropping again now we don't know if
[02:34.440 --> 02:37.840]  it's dropping only for a short time right now to only go back up but
[02:37.840 --> 02:43.120]  regardless there's been a long slide with dead cat bounces at the bottom of
[02:43.120 --> 02:48.880]  each new low but overall the trend is straight down into the abyss where so
[02:48.880 --> 02:53.560]  many other empires have collapsed Rome of course being one of the most famous
[02:53.560 --> 02:59.800]  with its currency devaluation finally finally causing it to break up with the
[02:59.800 --> 03:07.280]  Visigoths sacking of Rome by Alaric the great in the 410 so we're going to be
[03:07.280 --> 03:12.160]  going over all of that today as well as looking at the government attempted
[03:12.160 --> 03:20.520]  takeover of health care as our journey towards domestication and enslavement
[03:20.520 --> 03:26.960]  accelerates but tyranny comes home to me in Austin Texas we'll cover that and
[03:26.960 --> 03:30.800]  let you know what we're talking about coming up in the next segment but again
[03:30.800 --> 03:35.960]  Lord Christopher Moncton to talk about our victories against the global cartel
[03:35.960 --> 03:43.080]  and their taxing system their environmental taxation surf grid he will
[03:43.080 --> 03:48.280]  be joining us and also look forward into this new year on ways to defeat their
[03:48.280 --> 03:53.600]  agenda because as Lord Moncton has warned all over the planet the globalist
[03:53.600 --> 03:58.760]  use the bureaucracies to implement their taxation system even if the nation
[03:58.760 --> 04:03.040]  states themselves don't ratify it and sign on to it and he said that a few
[04:03.040 --> 04:07.280]  days before the Copenhagen summit closed and predicted exactly what happened
[04:07.280 --> 04:11.240]  though he said it was still an unbelievably huge victory because we're
[04:11.240 --> 04:15.960]  forcing them to engage in pure and open tyranny can't get the nations to sign
[04:15.960 --> 04:21.600]  on to it go ahead and implement it regardless so that is coming up and we
[04:21.600 --> 04:27.520]  will have completely open phones smattered with key news intel and
[04:27.520 --> 04:34.960]  information in the third and fourth hour of this worldwide broadcast today when
[04:34.960 --> 04:38.880]  we come back tyranny comes home to Austin Texas and the rest of the United
[04:38.880 --> 04:45.640]  States in the world we will also get into some of the other news dealing with a
[04:45.640 --> 04:50.080]  record cold temperatures across the planet right now record cold temperatures
[04:50.080 --> 04:54.240]  in the last century though I don't believe this is a sign of global
[04:54.240 --> 04:58.800]  cooling right now certainly shows this is not man-made global warming we'll be
[04:58.800 --> 05:04.040]  right back stay with us the illusion created by the power elite is a lie

[08:31.160 --> 08:36.200]  latest criminal activities of the world government through their environmental
[08:36.200 --> 08:41.360]  tyranny will be joining us for the full second hour coming up in t-minus 52
[08:41.360 --> 08:53.440]  minutes tyranny came home today to where I live the town I love and the time has
[08:53.440 --> 09:01.160]  come the time is now for us to aggressively resist this through boycotts
[09:01.160 --> 09:08.880]  through petitions through lawsuits our long journey into domestication and
[09:08.880 --> 09:16.000]  dependency on the scientific dictatorship is accelerating our entire
[09:16.000 --> 09:22.320]  society is being turned into a massive surveillance grid it has been designed
[09:22.320 --> 09:26.880]  to persecute the people homeland security and the military dictatorship
[09:26.880 --> 09:32.320]  Northcom openly have stated and we have their secret documents as well that
[09:32.320 --> 09:37.600]  Northcom is for the American people keeping control of the American people
[09:37.600 --> 09:42.000]  so that we don't legitimately and legally take control of our government of our
[09:42.000 --> 09:47.840]  nation it is there to block the people from stopping our nation from
[09:47.840 --> 09:52.800]  fraudulently being brought into financial receivership to foreign criminal
[09:52.800 --> 09:59.160]  offshore banks money laundering drug dealing white slavery controlling crime
[09:59.160 --> 10:08.360]  syndicates the history of the world is being conquered and conquering the
[10:08.360 --> 10:13.760]  history of the world is conquest and domination and that's what's happening
[10:13.760 --> 10:24.440]  today I remember seven years ago before homeland security became a cabinet
[10:24.440 --> 10:31.400]  position when it was in the process of taking over the 35 main federal agencies
[10:33.480 --> 10:37.640]  I remember researching and finding out that Bill Clinton had first given a
[10:37.640 --> 10:45.640]  speech in 1993 about it the council on foreign relations in 94 95 97 98 99 the
[10:45.640 --> 10:49.200]  heart Rudman commission of the council on foreign relations had laid out the
[10:49.200 --> 10:55.000]  plan for Northcom and homeland security before the attacks of 9-11 it was
[10:55.000 --> 11:01.400]  quietly being set up in Colorado Springs Colorado to bring the United States
[11:01.400 --> 11:06.800]  under a military dictatorship though a carefully camouflaged dictatorship that
[11:06.800 --> 11:10.920]  would slowly be rolled out that the public would slowly be conditioned to
[11:10.920 --> 11:15.640]  acquiesce to an accept in the name of fighting terrorism and saving the
[11:15.640 --> 11:22.520]  environment then in 2007 judicial watch sued and got the internal secret
[11:22.520 --> 11:27.960]  documents of the North American Union meeting the SPP with CEOs of the 100
[11:27.960 --> 11:35.320]  plus top powerful corporations in North America meeting with the cabinet heads of
[11:35.320 --> 11:40.560]  Mexico the United States and Canada and first up on their agenda was how to keep
[11:40.560 --> 11:44.880]  it secret how to implement North American integration by stealth so they
[11:44.880 --> 11:48.280]  could get rid of our Bill of Rights and Constitution by trumping it by creating a
[11:48.280 --> 11:53.880]  new system that superseded it through treaty but treaties done by the
[11:53.880 --> 11:58.760]  bureaucracy not with the full force of the Senate and in there they talked
[11:58.760 --> 12:05.960]  about the double prong the pincer of fake environmentalism carbon tax to take
[12:05.960 --> 12:11.280]  control of our lives and track everything we do and terrorism that is now
[12:11.280 --> 12:16.720]  happening and I saw Governor Ridge in a roundtable two-hour discussion with top
[12:16.720 --> 12:23.600]  CEOs on C-SPAN discuss the future and everything he said has since been in
[12:23.600 --> 12:27.880]  mainstream media articles like the Times of London article I read last night
[12:27.880 --> 12:33.680]  about Microsoft patents a system where everyone at work will wear a body
[12:33.680 --> 12:42.160]  sensor that will track your respiration your heart rate your brain waves it is a
[12:42.160 --> 12:48.800]  medical dictatorship a pharmacological dictatorship face scanning cameras body
[12:48.800 --> 12:54.120]  scanners to go in the malls the public schools just like metal detectors have
[12:54.120 --> 12:59.960]  gone in nationwide and how to have a job you will have to be in good graces
[12:59.960 --> 13:04.640]  with homeland security and how it would start with the no-fly list millions of
[13:04.640 --> 13:09.760]  people now on it innocent people no judge no jury no way to know why you got on
[13:09.760 --> 13:13.440]  the list that then when you if you have bad credit or haven't paid all your
[13:13.440 --> 13:18.680]  taxes they will simply turn your national ID biometric face scan thumb print
[13:18.680 --> 13:23.880]  access code off you will not be able to have a job you will not be able to buy
[13:23.880 --> 13:28.120]  or sell they are creating giant bureaucracies to hunt anyone down that
[13:28.120 --> 13:36.080]  operates outside of the system you've heard about million-dollar fines years in
[13:36.080 --> 13:43.200]  prison if you have an unauthorized garage sale or flea market or bizarre that is
[13:43.200 --> 13:48.080]  now not law it's just the bureaucracy is just doing it that's associated press
[13:48.080 --> 13:51.480]  Fox News that guys print that for me again
[13:51.480 --> 13:59.360]  have the head one of the headlines was jail time for garage sale all of this is
[13:59.360 --> 14:10.400]  going on unprecedented system of total control and the social engineers know
[14:10.400 --> 14:13.800]  what makes us tick they know how human beings operate they understand our
[14:13.800 --> 14:18.840]  social systems they understand our mammalian systems we're being trained
[14:18.840 --> 14:31.000]  like dogs right after 911 five airports had body scanners put in them you step
[14:31.000 --> 14:37.320]  in this meter wave radiation that major medical scientists and reports have said
[14:37.320 --> 14:43.240]  are definitely cancer causing energize your body it shoots right through your
[14:43.240 --> 14:49.720]  clothes and shoots a totally crisp image of your naked body drudge report
[14:49.720 --> 14:55.080]  yesterday had the big headline London independent also has an image of a man
[14:55.080 --> 15:04.120]  and his genitalia hanging down between his legs if they can sell you after years
[15:04.120 --> 15:07.880]  and years of admitting it will scan your naked body your sons your daughters
[15:07.880 --> 15:13.480]  your wife yourself and put it into a database and think of how many other
[15:13.480 --> 15:17.640]  DMV records and federal records always get stolen by their own employees and
[15:17.640 --> 15:20.880]  put out on the web it'll guarantee be licked on the web it'll be used against
[15:20.880 --> 15:28.720]  you think of what the tabloids will pay for the naked body of Angelina Jolie or
[15:28.720 --> 15:34.320]  Brad Pitt the government will record your naked body they're already doing it
[15:34.320 --> 15:38.880]  mass and now they've announced you know the first few years oh well if you
[15:38.880 --> 15:42.400]  refuse it we just do a pat down and maybe a strip search and ask you if you're a
[15:42.400 --> 15:46.080]  terrorist and screaming yell at you I've seen it happen to people I've never
[15:46.080 --> 15:49.560]  been called out at the few airports that had it in because they just randomly pick
[15:49.560 --> 15:52.920]  people they're wearing a giant turban and can't speak English and have no
[15:52.920 --> 15:57.920]  passport you're let right through but particularly if you're an old man in a
[15:57.920 --> 16:01.480]  wheelchair they tend to really get upset with them I don't know why almost every
[16:01.480 --> 16:08.840]  time I fly I see them jabbing and poking and screaming at some old person old
[16:08.840 --> 16:14.440]  ladies with knitting needles because you're the people they want to train to
[16:14.440 --> 16:19.440]  accept this you're the milk cows you're the cattle you're the once proud free
[16:19.440 --> 16:28.480]  people being trained to accept this now remember for the last year I reported on
[16:28.480 --> 16:37.560]  the Homeland Security funding of more than seven billion dollars that was
[16:37.560 --> 16:46.200]  funded in early 2009 for full-body scanners to go in 214 airports that's
[16:46.200 --> 16:57.120]  every major airport in the United States by 2010 and then magically on Christmas
[16:57.120 --> 17:03.400]  day you have the underwear bomber gets on without a passport is led on by the
[17:03.400 --> 17:11.560]  well-dressed man at the European Airport in Amsterdam there's another person
[17:11.560 --> 17:15.160]  reported with a bomb the FBI lies about that it has now been forced to change
[17:15.160 --> 17:18.800]  her story six times it was five times last night they've now changed it again
[17:18.800 --> 17:23.160]  and now admit he was indeed on that flight and they won't say where he went
[17:23.160 --> 17:28.040]  magically that happens and they begin beating the drum with an hours of it see
[17:28.040 --> 17:31.680]  we must have the body scanners we must have the body scanners it was all set
[17:31.680 --> 17:38.000]  it was all rigged every TV network every station had their talking points just
[17:38.000 --> 17:41.200]  like I told you with building seven I predicted that it would be Reuters that
[17:41.200 --> 17:46.320]  had given BBC and CNN a early report jumping the gun saying that building
[17:46.320 --> 17:51.280]  seven had fallen in its own footprint because the scripting goes out and two
[17:51.280 --> 17:57.480]  years later BBC admitted it was a Reuters report I'm telling you that
[17:57.480 --> 18:01.720]  within minutes and I'll guarantee you at some major newsrooms they probably got
[18:01.720 --> 18:06.240]  it early more smoking gun proof but we haven't proven that yet we've proven
[18:06.240 --> 18:09.560]  it in the past I know how they operate I know their MO I know their manuals I
[18:09.560 --> 18:17.560]  know their operations I will guarantee you my bottom dollar because I saw it
[18:17.560 --> 18:21.840]  within minutes I was driving to the store Christmas Day to buy some eggs he'd
[18:21.840 --> 18:26.560]  forgotten to buy some looking around for convenience store that was open got in
[18:26.560 --> 18:31.160]  the car turned it on listen to the report pure coverage on 590 a.m. carrying
[18:31.160 --> 18:37.000]  Fox News radio drove home sat in the parking lot for 30 minutes listening and
[18:37.000 --> 18:41.760]  I said by tonight they'll be calling for body scanners went to Drudge went to ABC
[18:41.760 --> 18:45.680]  News online my wife's like why aren't you spending time with the kids I said
[18:45.680 --> 18:50.080]  sorry I've got to check this and the first thing up was body scanners and I
[18:50.080 --> 18:55.160]  said okay this is a big piece of the puzzle this was staged if they start
[18:55.160 --> 18:59.560]  calling for the Patriot Act expansion with by tomorrow we'll know it was
[18:59.560 --> 19:04.200]  scripted boom did that if we hear this guy got on without proper ID and that

[24:32.480 --> 24:39.080]  without warrants randomly England is already in the last four years putting
[24:39.080 --> 24:45.200]  body scanners in at some of their train stations they have random vans vans that
[24:45.200 --> 24:48.760]  drive around randomly grabbing people and sometimes they pull up to a bar and put
[24:48.760 --> 24:53.280]  everyone through them England is on the exact same management system we are
[24:53.280 --> 24:57.720]  there about four years ahead of us and notice how the new year rolls around
[24:57.720 --> 25:01.720]  they kick it all off they already had the machines ordered built shipped being

[25:16.120 --> 25:21.200]  they'll arrest a few people Trump charges up on them and then people in
[25:21.200 --> 25:24.640]  business and in life I mean how am I supposed to fly out to California to be
[25:24.640 --> 25:28.240]  on Jesse Ventura's TV show how am I supposed to fly places see they're
[25:28.240 --> 25:32.280]  controlling our mobility and then it won't matter even if I put up with the
[25:32.280 --> 25:36.640]  body scanners they say I'm not in favor with my taxes they say I've got bad
[25:36.640 --> 25:43.720]  credit Google that bad credit no fly list bad credit no work list they have a
[25:43.720 --> 25:48.200]  new criminal list the last few years with millions of Americans on it they
[25:48.200 --> 25:52.360]  have Patriot Act compliance for car dealerships and rental cars and hotels
[25:52.360 --> 26:00.000]  and all major businesses a total system of surveillance where you are forced to
[26:00.000 --> 26:03.440]  go file all your information with the government this is all being put in
[26:03.440 --> 26:09.880]  place and now the FBI is in headlines saying we need the x-ray machines and
[26:09.880 --> 26:15.640]  body scanners at all malls everywhere you go if we don't stop them and if we
[26:15.640 --> 26:19.080]  don't resist what they're doing and point out what they're doing everywhere
[26:19.080 --> 26:23.440]  will be warrantless checkpoints the federal government in the mid 90s said
[26:23.440 --> 26:28.240]  that in the decades to come they wanted hardened checkpoints at toll roads on
[26:28.240 --> 26:33.560]  interstate highways to randomly search Americans they won't control the border
[26:33.560 --> 26:38.680]  but a hundred miles in from Vermont to Minnesota to Texas to California to
[26:38.680 --> 26:43.240]  Florida they're searching people a hundred miles in when they do arrest
[26:43.240 --> 26:46.520]  illegals homeland security takes them according to the Associated Press and
[26:46.520 --> 26:51.400]  gives them green cards and federal government jobs but citizens are beat
[26:51.400 --> 26:56.560]  up citizens are treated like scum because it's all aimed at you it's all
[26:56.560 --> 27:03.040]  aimed at me it was all built for us they train you in the airports to take your
[27:03.040 --> 27:08.360]  shoes off to pull your shirt out to be asked questions to be patted down to go
[27:08.360 --> 27:12.880]  in the bomb sniffing machines to go in the body scanners at first it's only
[27:12.880 --> 27:17.920]  one out of ten they flag randomly to train you then it's everybody and
[27:17.920 --> 27:22.400]  homeland security is for two years looking at making you wear taser
[27:22.400 --> 27:28.600]  bracelets everyone oh we'll all be safe now we all wear taser bracelets shock
[27:28.600 --> 27:37.600]  bracelets full body scanners at Austin Berkstrom International Airport where I
[27:37.600 --> 27:43.920]  live you know what I'm not going to stop flying they may beat the wrap but
[27:43.920 --> 27:48.560]  they're not going to beat the ride I'm gonna fly and I'm gonna do it with
[27:48.560 --> 27:56.920]  witnesses and I'm going to sue them when they force me into the body scanners
[27:56.920 --> 28:01.920]  I'm going to and they'll say oh homeland security oh national security we will
[28:01.920 --> 28:07.400]  still expose them we will say no we will boycott the airlines some of us must
[28:07.400 --> 28:13.520]  fly but others we can have targeted boycotts of any pleasure travel and
[28:13.520 --> 28:19.480]  boycott travel now the globalist on top they want to end major travel they've
[28:19.480 --> 28:23.240]  said it the UN has stated more a strong has said it that you'll have to get
[28:23.240 --> 28:27.040]  authorization to prove that your travel is essential in the future so they're
[28:27.040 --> 28:31.520]  so they're getting you ready for that now no buying no selling unless your
[28:31.520 --> 28:37.680]  numbers add up unless homeland security gives you the wave no buying gas no buying
[28:37.680 --> 28:44.840]  food but early on we can boycott the airlines and force them to get the
[28:44.840 --> 28:46.920]  government to back off now the government will come in like they did
[28:46.920 --> 28:52.320]  after 9-11 and say oh here's $10 million here's $25 million in one payoff to the
[28:52.320 --> 28:57.280]  airlines then the airlines lay off people and claim their profits are down and they
[28:57.280 --> 29:02.320]  made huge profits and they'll still try to force it through but there's
[29:02.320 --> 29:08.280]  things we can do when we come back I'm gonna play you a clip from 590 a.m. with

[29:20.080 --> 29:24.000]  concerns these concerns aren't the tip of the iceberg of how really bad this is

[33:52.900 --> 34:00.040]  grid going in worldwide under UN agreement body scanners we need to formulate
[34:00.040 --> 34:06.960]  a plan to boycott this on multi fronts we need to formulate a plan to dump

[34:18.200 --> 34:22.480]  imagine what comes next they're never going to stop it's always more more more
[34:22.480 --> 34:28.760]  security and then all the old security always fails and then those that fail
[34:28.760 --> 34:33.520]  and that's in quotes they're not failing they're doing their job they always get
[34:33.520 --> 34:38.880]  rewarded and get pay increases and get promoted for failing because they're not
[34:38.880 --> 34:44.120]  really failing the drug war isn't failing more people in prison more drugs on
[34:44.120 --> 34:49.600]  the streets the public schools aren't failing they're designed and chartered to
[34:49.600 --> 34:53.760]  dump people down and make them pliable deliberate dumbing down of America the
[34:53.760 --> 34:58.920]  book we sell it in full wars dot com the size of a Dallas phone book filled with
[34:58.920 --> 35:02.560]  government documents about how they plan to dump children down leaked by
[35:02.560 --> 35:09.080]  Charlotte is there be former head of policy Department of Education this is
[35:09.080 --> 35:15.000]  a program of social engineering and control the good news is people are
[35:15.000 --> 35:19.800]  really upset about walking in and having their bodies recorded now these companies
[35:19.800 --> 35:24.920]  always say oh well we don't store the image but that it turns out that grocery
[35:24.920 --> 35:28.840]  stores and tanning salons and other places and libraries that make you
[35:28.840 --> 35:32.400]  thumb print biometrically to check out books or get your school lunches of
[35:32.400 --> 35:37.600]  course they save it how do you think they thumb scan you and then next time
[35:37.600 --> 35:43.080]  you thumb print they thumb scan you and then a sign it to your name and the
[35:43.080 --> 35:46.720]  next time you thumb print no ideas needed at the school lunch programs at
[35:46.720 --> 35:51.200]  thousands of school districts across the country Europe's got it as well because
[35:51.200 --> 35:55.520]  they have your thumb print but the legalese trick they use the lawyer trick
[35:55.520 --> 36:04.080]  like Bill Clinton saying it depends on what the term is means is is they play
[36:04.080 --> 36:08.280]  these lawyer tricks and they say well we don't actually save the thumb print we
[36:08.280 --> 36:15.880]  save a biometric scan of ones and zeros that reconfigure the thumb print and
[36:15.880 --> 36:23.960]  then create a digital barcode from it a biometric identifier from it and so what
[36:23.960 --> 36:27.040]  they're doing is is they're getting your biometric signature with these
[36:27.040 --> 36:32.560]  scanners and it is being recorded that's how they give it to the media to show
[36:32.560 --> 36:40.240]  you all these images of naked people because they're recording and I remember
[36:40.240 --> 36:46.960]  so many newscasts in Austin about HEB at stores around Texas it's the biggest
[36:46.960 --> 36:52.280]  chain in Texas they also own Central Market but Safeway and others for at
[36:52.280 --> 36:56.280]  least a decade have been putting them in the self-checkout lines but see humans
[36:56.280 --> 36:59.600]  like to talk to another human when they engage in commerce so those haven't gone
[36:59.600 --> 37:04.080]  over too well the plan was to have say 10 checkout lines go to three or four of
[37:04.080 --> 37:08.840]  them is self-checkout then over time phase them all out home depot tried that
[37:08.840 --> 37:12.320]  at some stores in Austin people just quit going there so they removed some of
[37:12.320 --> 37:16.840]  them so the good news is people don't like this and if you just vote with your
[37:16.840 --> 37:22.040]  dollars and say no to thumb scanners to buy and sell no to face scanners to buy
[37:22.040 --> 37:28.800]  and sell no to the Bonnie scanners we can back these people off but we've got to
[37:28.800 --> 37:36.840]  say no now next is mobile vans driving around forcing you into the scanners and
[37:36.840 --> 37:42.800]  once they have this they have passive millimeter wave readers that from as far
[37:42.800 --> 37:48.000]  as a hundred feet away and these have been tested in airports as well shoot
[37:48.000 --> 37:53.200]  the waves through your clothing and scan your body and if they already have a
[37:53.200 --> 37:57.840]  good 360 scan with the big scanners they're putting in that you walk into
[37:57.840 --> 38:03.880]  they can then get a biometric signature as accurate as a face scan or a thumb
[38:03.880 --> 38:10.960]  scan a hand scan or a index finger scan once they have that and that's what
[38:10.960 --> 38:15.200]  they've done in Iraq all over Iraq and the Pentagon admits this MIT magazine a
[38:15.200 --> 38:20.960]  few years ago reported on it they set up checkpoints they issue everyone in
[38:20.960 --> 38:25.000]  Baghdad and Fallujah and Bazaar and every other major city IDs they take you
[38:25.000 --> 38:31.640]  into the army slash Marine Corps area I saw this in 1999 it's in my film
[38:31.640 --> 38:35.880]  police day 2000 they did a takeover drill with foreign troops and the Marine
[38:35.880 --> 38:44.080]  Corps in Oakland and they led us into an interrogation until Mr. Jones the
[38:44.080 --> 38:47.120]  Marine Corps liaison ran up and said he's not allowed to be here get him out
[38:47.120 --> 38:51.400]  of here but then we simply had somebody else poses another reporter and go in
[38:51.400 --> 38:56.880]  and get it all and you see them thumb printing people playing the part of US
[38:56.880 --> 38:59.400]  militias and they're asking where'd you get the helmet where'd you get the
[38:59.400 --> 39:04.440]  weapons where what city do you come from I come from San Francisco why are you
[39:04.440 --> 39:11.600]  fighting us and then Jones ran in and said get out of here Jones turn the
[39:11.600 --> 39:17.160]  camera off Jones get out of here Jones you're not supposed to be seeing this
[39:17.160 --> 39:23.200]  well in Iraq and in Serbia and other areas of the globalist took over in
[39:23.200 --> 39:27.400]  pristine it to be exact and because of them they make all the villagers they
[39:27.400 --> 39:31.440]  go hey we got free welfare we got free food for you we just want to give you a
[39:31.440 --> 39:35.360]  security ID you come in they get a face scan they get a thumb print they get a
[39:35.360 --> 39:40.600]  hand scan and then remember Tom Brokaw and his last broadcast I had this on
[39:40.600 --> 39:46.280]  tape we put it on YouTube he said anyone caught in or outside of Fallujah
[39:46.280 --> 39:50.600]  without their ID card is executed on the spot quite a war crime quite a statement
[39:50.600 --> 39:57.080]  and so see once they have your face scan and your thumb print then with passive
[39:57.080 --> 40:01.040]  systems at a distance they just scan your face but even if it's covered they
[40:01.040 --> 40:05.840]  shoot through your clothes and it has the biometrics of your body they also have
[40:05.840 --> 40:09.840]  the biometrics of your walk and those have gone in all over the planet all
[40:09.840 --> 40:15.080]  over the Western world they also have your heat resonance signature once they
[40:15.080 --> 40:21.400]  assign that code number satellites from above can look at the heat signature of
[40:21.400 --> 40:27.520]  the top of your head and your shoulders and get a close to they say close to
[40:27.520 --> 40:34.960]  100% accurate scan from space they have blimps tethered on the borders but
[40:34.960 --> 40:40.160]  untethered at above 100,000 feet across the United States and Europe I told you
[40:40.160 --> 40:44.640]  about that nine years ago it's now been declassified as public news I told you
[40:44.640 --> 40:49.640]  14 years ago that all babies in the Western world from Australia to Canada
[40:49.640 --> 40:55.440]  the United States had blood taken for a UN database now declassified what massive
[40:55.440 --> 41:01.360]  lawsuits filed associated press reported two weeks ago that the state but
[41:01.360 --> 41:03.920]  notice only saying the state because even the lawyers don't know what they're
[41:03.920 --> 41:10.160]  doing the state of Texas is destroying four million that's only the tip of the
[41:10.160 --> 41:19.800]  iceberg you understand this is a total eugenics grid so that's what's going on
[41:19.800 --> 41:25.880]  that's what's happening right now face scanners license plate scanners your
[41:25.880 --> 41:31.200]  cell phones being listened to mainstream media reports and even Jesse
[41:31.200 --> 41:34.720]  Ventura I gave him the information put it in his big brother special where the
[41:34.720 --> 41:41.360]  Secret Service admits that a man during a terror drill in Washington state
[41:41.360 --> 41:47.960]  simply called the local bank and said hey I'm part of this group they're gonna
[41:47.960 --> 41:52.120]  be doing a drill you should watch out for these terror drills this nuclear
[41:52.120 --> 41:56.480]  attack drill sometimes they go live within a day the Secret Service showed
[41:56.480 --> 42:02.280]  up at his house with an NSA transcript of everything he said it's all being
[42:02.280 --> 42:06.880]  recorded and they mean for you to know this now so you get a chilling effect
[42:06.880 --> 42:12.120]  and shut up no if we all get scared and shut up then they win but if we all
[42:12.120 --> 42:15.920]  speak out so what have they put a hundred million of us on the list we can
[42:15.920 --> 42:20.040]  boycott them we can protest and we can resist them and they will be exposed as
[42:20.040 --> 42:23.160]  the tyrants they are and what's happening is the public knows we're being
[42:23.160 --> 42:26.600]  surveilled now they know big brothers in place and they're saying why does every
[42:26.600 --> 42:34.000]  terrorist make it through why did this guy not have to have a passport see on
[42:34.000 --> 42:37.400]  and on and on the people are now waking up and they're saying why don't you just
[42:37.400 --> 42:41.240]  profile if this is supposedly all Muslims doing this why don't you profile
[42:41.240 --> 42:46.480]  oh we can't do that we have to make sure all of you get tracked and traced and
[42:46.480 --> 42:57.040]  controlled so here's a 590 a.m. k.l.b.j. news report from here in Austin the
[42:57.040 --> 43:00.200]  federal initiative aims to step up the screening process started with all
[43:00.200 --> 43:03.800]  international airports which includes a b.i.a. but and you may leak with the
[43:03.800 --> 43:07.600]  flyers rights organization says the body scanners manufactured by rapid scan
[43:07.600 --> 43:12.080]  offers no anonymity or privacy we consider these to be very invasive and
[43:12.080 --> 43:17.080]  link them with the equivalent of a search it should just be a chalk imprint
[43:17.080 --> 43:21.480]  of the body so it cannot be identified Malik also says the body scanners are
[43:21.480 --> 43:25.680]  not very effective she says in many cases explosives can go undetected when
[43:25.680 --> 43:33.680]  they're hidden inside a person Ryan poppy news radio 590 k.o.b.j. and I have a
[43:33.680 --> 43:38.120]  another report here from the London Independent detailing our planned
[43:38.120 --> 43:43.960]  airport scanners just a scam billions and billions of dollars a year spent to
[43:43.960 --> 43:50.120]  roll these out London Independent shows an image of a man with a genitalia
[43:50.120 --> 43:55.480]  hanging down between his legs and notice every one of these scans they show you
[43:55.480 --> 44:01.040]  is from a mock drill where the person had a weapon so the subconscious image and
[44:01.040 --> 44:06.920]  message is everyone who gets scanned is guilty they never show you a body scan
[44:06.920 --> 44:13.320]  where they don't have a 357 or a dagger or a bomb hidden so the message here is
[44:13.320 --> 44:18.240]  oh see it's good it's just like cops everybody they pull over is either white
[44:18.240 --> 44:23.600]  trash scum or some form of filth some horrible degenerate scraggly criminal the
[44:23.600 --> 44:27.880]  cops are all well-dressed and focused and professional and the message for 15
[44:27.880 --> 44:33.080]  years with the TV show funded by the Justice Department the message is the
[44:33.080 --> 44:37.880]  public or scum the police are God and clean and good and all of these
[44:37.880 --> 44:44.600]  violations of people's rights you see on the show are warranted now this next
[44:44.600 --> 44:48.360]  clip is from the company that got Homeland Security to meet with them and
[44:48.360 --> 44:52.360]  to recommend it and say we need to look at doing this so Homeland Security two
[44:52.360 --> 44:57.880]  years ago and we have the Fox News and CNN reports on this saying how great an
[44:57.880 --> 45:05.400]  idea this is see how crazy it's all gotten EMT safety bracelet is what this
[45:05.400 --> 45:11.520]  is called is there a solution to deterring hijackers once they are on the
[45:11.520 --> 45:18.680]  aircraft yes there is a very viable workable answer it starts here when
[45:18.680 --> 45:23.880]  passengers are issued their tickets at that time they can also be fitted with a
[45:23.880 --> 45:28.640]  special electronic ID bracelet that they will wear until they disembark the
[45:28.640 --> 45:34.680]  flight at the destination these electronic coded bracelets will notice
[45:34.680 --> 45:39.960]  how they introduce it like oh your issue did it's no big deal it's an
[45:39.960 --> 45:44.520]  electronic bracelet and they just slip in by the way it'll also shocks you into
[45:44.520 --> 45:49.880]  unconsciousness continue make traveling much more convenient for the public oh
[45:49.880 --> 45:53.680]  it's convenient it will replace the need to carry a ticket by containing all
[45:53.680 --> 45:57.960]  pertinent passenger information wonderful in addition the bracelet could
[45:57.960 --> 46:01.840]  permit tracking of the passenger through the terminal including carry-on
[46:01.840 --> 46:08.240]  luggage checked luggage can be coded to match the bracelet to ensure no tampering
[46:08.240 --> 46:14.280]  or diversions by further equipping each bracelet with EMD technology the
[46:14.280 --> 46:19.240]  bracelets will allow crew members using radio frequency transmitters to quickly
[46:19.240 --> 46:24.360]  and effectively subdue hijackers the electromuscular disruption signal
[46:24.360 --> 46:28.640]  overrides the attackers central nervous system and will render even the most
[46:28.640 --> 46:32.720]  elite and aggressive terrorist completely immobile for several minutes
[46:32.720 --> 46:37.520]  this will allow the crew to subdue and handcuff that individual
[46:37.520 --> 46:42.680]  EMD technology is designed to incapacitate a target from a safe
[46:42.680 --> 46:47.600]  distance without causing permanent injury which means these criminals will
[46:47.600 --> 46:53.560]  survive and go to trial the bracelet would only be armed by someone on board
[46:53.560 --> 47:00.040]  upon confirmation that a takeover situation exists to a businessman on
[47:00.040 --> 47:04.400]  his way home to be reunited with his family or to a young family going south
[47:04.400 --> 47:09.320]  for a winter holiday wearing an EMD safety bracelet for a few hours during a
[47:09.320 --> 47:14.600]  flight is a small inconvenience to ensure their safe arrival we feel have
[47:14.600 --> 47:19.280]  given the choice between taking a flight employing the added security of the EMD
[47:19.280 --> 47:23.560]  safety bracelet system and taking a flight without the additional security
[47:23.560 --> 47:28.880]  many if not most passengers would happily opt for the extra security of
[47:28.880 --> 47:37.080]  EMD safety bracelet oh yes endless hype endless fear you are hundreds of times
[47:37.080 --> 47:41.680]  more likely and they've done national news reports on this to drown or to die
[47:41.680 --> 47:48.160]  in a car wreck or to be mugged or robbed and to be killed by a bomber on a plane
[47:48.160 --> 47:54.080]  terrorism is incredibly rare most of its manufactured some of its real and so
[47:54.080 --> 47:57.760]  let's all just be fitted with these bracelets well next it'll be how about
[47:57.760 --> 48:02.800]  the public schools you know that way of kids are fighting oh next you want to go
[48:02.800 --> 48:05.880]  to the mall you want to come in here you got to wear this bracelet notice how have
[48:05.880 --> 48:10.880]  you go to Disney World or Disneyland or if you go to SeaWorld five six seven
[48:10.880 --> 48:15.800]  years ago depending on what facility if you just wanted to discount a 25%
[48:15.800 --> 48:20.320]  discount you would hand scan biometrically to get in and you got a
[48:20.320 --> 48:24.480]  discount and most people lined up and did it I would say no they would act
[48:24.480 --> 48:29.160]  like you had to do it too they just said oh well it's a discount now at these
[48:29.160 --> 48:33.720]  parks they're saying you have to do it they don't care see this is all phased
[48:33.720 --> 48:48.320]  in incrementally total big brother worse than 1984 in your face
[48:48.960 --> 48:55.040]  meanwhile every time someone leaves a bag in an airport or somebody wanders
[48:55.040 --> 49:02.200]  around the wrong way I myself at airports before they'll have an open area
[49:02.200 --> 49:09.520]  right by the security check I myself once found myself wandering the wrong way
[49:09.520 --> 49:16.520]  and got almost through the side checkpoint where people exit and no one
[49:16.520 --> 49:21.880]  even said anything to me there was one guy behind a counter looking at a
[49:21.880 --> 49:25.080]  computer screen and I turned around and scurried off and he kind of noticed it
[49:25.080 --> 49:34.280]  but didn't say anything well somebody in Newark International Airport in New
[49:34.280 --> 49:38.000]  Jersey wandered the wrong way through and they totally just shut the whole
[49:38.000 --> 49:45.560]  airport down and acted like a brigade of Nazi soldiers had landed I mean they
[49:45.560 --> 49:49.360]  were behaving as if 10,000 blood drinking cobras had been released in the
[49:49.360 --> 49:56.160]  concourse thousands re-screened at Newark Airport a security breach at Newark
[49:56.160 --> 49:59.840]  Liberty International Airport Sunday evening forced the closure of a terminal
[49:59.840 --> 50:03.800]  for hours while authorities re-screened thousands of passengers the incident
[50:03.800 --> 50:08.720]  happened at about 5 20 p.m. at Terminal C and see they act like it's just so
[50:08.720 --> 50:14.920]  important and so serious and and it is it's your training to be a slave when a
[50:14.920 --> 50:20.520]  man walked through an exit on the public side of the secure sterile side for
[50:20.520 --> 50:23.920]  passengers who had cleared screening according to Transportation Security
[50:23.920 --> 50:28.720]  Administration re-screening began at Port Authority police and TSA swept each of
[50:28.720 --> 50:33.480]  the concourses in the terminal with negative findings said and Davis a TSA
[50:33.480 --> 50:37.640]  spokesperson the man in question was never located but everybody on their
[50:37.640 --> 50:43.040]  planes nothing happened so see this is how it's being done so now we need to
[50:43.040 --> 50:46.960]  discuss and I'm launching a boycott right now of all the airlines it's their
[50:46.960 --> 50:50.860]  job to say no to this they're the private groups that have let the feds
[50:50.860 --> 50:55.080]  take them over under international agreements and we need to say no to this
[50:55.080 --> 50:59.520]  and we need to call the White House in the Congress and say stop it we'll be
[50:59.520 --> 51:05.840]  right back is your computer running slowly thinking about buying a new one

[52:12.520 --> 52:15.320]  we're pulling the rug from underneath Americans at home
[52:15.320 --> 52:20.240]  have tremendous influence on our president in Congress and they really are
[52:20.240 --> 52:25.720]  calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to
[52:25.720 --> 52:29.920]  pay attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the

[56:03.520 --> 56:07.000]  next ten years which of course it won't happen it'll be two or three and they'll
[56:07.000 --> 56:12.920]  hype it up like it's the end of the world even if a thousand jetliners got
[56:12.920 --> 56:17.800]  blown up it's better than us becoming total slaves learn what Thomas Jefferson
[56:17.800 --> 56:21.560]  and Benjamin Franklin and others pointed out that those that will give up

[57:03.000 --> 57:06.400]  scanning cameras the license plate reading cameras the biometrics the body
[57:06.400 --> 57:10.800]  scanners they don't tell you they're taking your baby's blood at birth they
[57:10.800 --> 57:16.080]  don't tell you this is a biometric scan just to scan you on the street but it's
[57:16.080 --> 57:23.640]  all in the company literature you actually research this morning I called
[57:23.640 --> 57:27.160]  into 590 a.m. they were talking about this and the host let me on but still
[57:27.160 --> 57:32.680]  make fun of me and played Ozzy Osbourne's crazy train under me because I'm
[57:32.680 --> 57:36.400]  explaining that you're being recorded naked because I'm explaining this is

[1:00:05.720 --> 1:00:13.520]  big brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does
[1:00:13.520 --> 1:00:21.040]  he he's Alex Jones on the GCM radio network and now live from Austin Texas
[1:00:21.040 --> 1:00:30.000]  Alex Jones thank you for joining us for the first live broadcast of 2010 the
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:33.720]  first live weekday transmission we kicked it off yesterday with the
[1:00:33.720 --> 1:00:39.520]  abbreviated Sunday 4 to 6 p.m. than I do every Sunday because we're in a war for
[1:00:39.520 --> 1:00:44.600]  Western civilization a war for liberty and freedom private offshore interests
[1:00:44.600 --> 1:00:49.040]  the United Nations and others are openly setting up world government Lord
[1:00:49.040 --> 1:00:53.600]  Christopher Monkton of course was the top advisor to Margaret Thatcher he has
[1:00:53.600 --> 1:00:58.320]  international consulting firm on scientific and corporate issues to
[1:00:58.320 --> 1:01:02.800]  governments and Fortune 500 he of course is an award-winning journalist in his
[1:01:02.800 --> 1:01:07.280]  own right as bio goes on and on will give you his website several times before
[1:01:07.280 --> 1:01:13.360]  he leaves us today he's with us graciously for the next hour he with
[1:01:13.360 --> 1:01:17.680]  stunning accuracy and you know I don't say that for most guests and unless it's
[1:01:17.680 --> 1:01:21.720]  warranted and do but I want to single out his accuracy so that people pay
[1:01:21.720 --> 1:01:27.600]  particular heed today with exactly the slogans exactly the nomenclature exactly
[1:01:27.600 --> 1:01:32.640]  what would happen at Copenhagen how they would even if it failed still have the
[1:01:32.640 --> 1:01:36.440]  bureaucracy try to implement it which Gordon Brown has announced treacherously
[1:01:36.440 --> 1:01:44.440]  against the free republics of the world and so he joins us to talk about what
[1:01:44.440 --> 1:01:51.240]  really happened at Copenhagen what this new system is by the industrialized
[1:01:51.240 --> 1:01:54.560]  world saying they're going to monitor nations carbon footprint and go ahead
[1:01:54.560 --> 1:01:58.480]  and start levying the taxes and goling out Western taxpayer money from Europe
[1:01:58.480 --> 1:02:04.800]  England and the United States and then we're going to move into the latest on
[1:02:04.800 --> 1:02:08.440]  climategate and and how these fraudsters are still trying to take over at the
[1:02:08.440 --> 1:02:12.920]  local level here in the US taxes on TVs at the state level in many states taxes
[1:02:12.920 --> 1:02:17.160]  on plastic bags home inspections the UN has announced with Schwarzenegger
[1:02:17.160 --> 1:02:21.800]  governor's conferences mayor conferences doling out money for cities to
[1:02:21.800 --> 1:02:26.960]  implement this circumventing the federal government working with foreign
[1:02:26.960 --> 1:02:31.280]  powers this is completely illegal and unconstitutional and is an act of
[1:02:31.280 --> 1:02:34.400]  sedition so we're going to break here in just a few minutes and come back in the
[1:02:34.400 --> 1:02:39.120]  long segment but I want to introduce Lord Christopher Monkton sir great to
[1:02:39.120 --> 1:02:42.800]  have you here with us well I think it's a real pleasure once again to be with you
[1:02:42.800 --> 1:02:48.080]  and you're quite right the usual suspects are still doing their best after
[1:02:48.080 --> 1:02:53.800]  the quite spectacular failure of the Copenhagen conference to try and turn it
[1:02:53.800 --> 1:02:58.840]  into what is their turn in a success by setting up a so-called high-level panel
[1:02:58.840 --> 1:03:03.200]  which is if you like the kind of stub of the world government they had hoped to
[1:03:03.200 --> 1:03:08.640]  grow and they will hope to start transferring your money and mine to that
[1:03:08.640 --> 1:03:14.520]  high-level panel along with the Copenhagen green fund it's actually called
[1:03:14.520 --> 1:03:20.440]  the Copenhagen green fund no longer any pretend the political objectivity we're
[1:03:20.440 --> 1:03:25.040]  now in among the reds who call themselves green the watermelons and they
[1:03:25.040 --> 1:03:30.920]  are now named as the green fund which is going to be the recipient of all this
[1:03:30.920 --> 1:03:35.720]  money that we're going to pay the United States in particular has said it's
[1:03:35.720 --> 1:03:41.520]  going to contribute really enormous sums of money your money to this green fund
[1:03:41.520 --> 1:03:46.520]  and what it's really going to be used for of course is not to help the poorer
[1:03:46.520 --> 1:03:50.120]  countries of the world to adapt to climate change because there's nothing
[1:03:50.120 --> 1:03:56.040]  to adapt to it will be spent instead on setting up and growing the expensive
[1:03:56.040 --> 1:04:02.880]  corrupt central government bureaucracy of the new very left-wing virtually
[1:04:02.880 --> 1:04:08.200]  marked this world government which the likes of Gordon Brown and Obama and
[1:04:08.200 --> 1:04:13.600]  Kevin Rudd in Australia would so very much like to see and which the countries
[1:04:13.600 --> 1:04:18.520]  like China and Russia of course who are also inclined in that authoritarian
[1:04:18.520 --> 1:04:24.480]  totalitarian direction are also inclined to follow so we haven't won as a result
[1:04:24.480 --> 1:04:28.840]  of Copenhagen we've certainly won on points but it's not yet a knockout much
[1:04:28.840 --> 1:04:34.560]  more work is to be done if we are to stop this very sinister movement towards
[1:04:34.560 --> 1:04:39.400]  undemocratic world government from carrying on any further let us suppose
[1:04:39.400 --> 1:04:43.680]  that there was a scientific or economic cake Lord Monkton doing anything about
[1:04:43.680 --> 1:04:48.160]  the climate yeah we've got a break come back right there sorry to cut you off
[1:04:48.160 --> 1:04:52.680]  no lovely third Viscount of branch Lee and Monkton Lord Christopher Monkton is
[1:04:52.680 --> 1:04:57.720]  our guest please stay with us he'll be right back as he gives us a worldwide
[1:04:57.720 --> 1:05:03.200]  briefing on what these criminals are up to this is Alex Jones with five good
[1:05:03.200 --> 1:05:07.200]  reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator number one new
[1:05:07.200 --> 1:05:11.000]  climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill number two
[1:05:11.000 --> 1:05:15.080]  our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric company
[1:05:15.080 --> 1:05:19.320]  allows you to have it's true total government control of electricity in the
[1:05:19.320 --> 1:05:23.560]  name of smart grid technology is coming number three in some areas of the
[1:05:23.560 --> 1:05:27.560]  country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist
[1:05:27.560 --> 1:05:31.680]  legislation is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather
[1:05:31.680 --> 1:05:35.640]  is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[1:05:35.640 --> 1:05:39.800]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator provides
[1:05:39.800 --> 1:05:43.600]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar
[1:05:43.600 --> 1:05:47.120]  power generators offered by solution from science one of my oldest sponsors
[1:05:47.120 --> 1:05:53.040]  you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com that's mysolarbackup.com
[1:05:53.040 --> 1:05:57.840]  remember the government doesn't own the Sun so go to mysolarbackup.com or call

[1:06:02.800 --> 1:06:06.400]  hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the silver lungs
[1:06:06.400 --> 1:06:11.160]  generator now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the
[1:06:11.160 --> 1:06:15.080]  solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the
[1:06:15.080 --> 1:06:18.920]  lungs the respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne
[1:06:18.920 --> 1:06:23.880]  pathogens and viruses the silver lungs generator infuses the respiratory system
[1:06:23.880 --> 1:06:29.160]  with your self-produced nano silver solutions and also delivers the silver
[1:06:29.160 --> 1:06:33.800]  nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream with continued legislation
[1:06:33.800 --> 1:06:38.000]  threatening the sale of nano silver products you can now produce pure and
[1:06:38.000 --> 1:06:42.920]  endless colloidal silver with the silver lungs generator very easy to follow
[1:06:42.920 --> 1:06:47.640]  step-by-step instructions are provided making production fast and simple go to
[1:06:47.640 --> 1:06:53.240]  www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of
[1:06:53.240 --> 1:06:59.400]  the silver lungs generator that's www.silverlungs.com
[1:07:02.000 --> 1:07:06.720]  hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone this
[1:07:06.720 --> 1:07:12.240]  is our last chance to not relive history as we're finishing off this agenda that
[1:07:12.240 --> 1:07:15.600]  we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home and have turned
[1:07:15.600 --> 1:07:20.440]  members influence on our president in Congress and they really are calling the
[1:07:20.440 --> 1:07:25.560]  shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay
[1:07:25.560 --> 1:07:30.120]  attention for the republic identifies the enemies of our nation the criminal
[1:07:30.120 --> 1:07:34.800]  offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes
[1:07:34.800 --> 1:07:38.840]  constructing world government Tim Geithner Bernanke their arsonists they're
[1:07:38.840 --> 1:07:42.520]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying who to make the check out to
[1:07:42.520 --> 1:07:47.320]  today seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington DC we have
[1:07:47.320 --> 1:07:53.240]  seen a fall of the Republic get your copy of fall of the Republic on DVD at

[1:08:29.360 --> 1:08:36.440]  our guest if you had to single one person out as the general or the George
[1:08:36.440 --> 1:08:42.560]  Washington of this fight against the climate criminals the scaremongers who
[1:08:42.560 --> 1:08:47.400]  know it's a fraud that want to tax the control all facets of life it's Lord
[1:08:47.400 --> 1:08:52.200]  Christopher Moncton he is the main champion of the focal point articulating
[1:08:52.200 --> 1:08:56.800]  the facts predicting the enemy's movements and giving us the intel to
[1:08:56.800 --> 1:09:01.720]  devastate their operations we've had a major victory at Copenhagen in this
[1:09:01.720 --> 1:09:05.920]  engagement likening it to a naval engagement but the enemy's main fleet
[1:09:05.920 --> 1:09:12.240]  is remassing to launch more attacks circumnavigating the federal governments
[1:09:12.240 --> 1:09:15.880]  of the planet going directly to the states the counties of the cities
[1:09:15.880 --> 1:09:21.080]  Schwarzenegger leading that treacherous charge here in the United States they're
[1:09:21.080 --> 1:09:25.480]  also having the bureaucracies of England and the European Union and the United

[1:09:34.200 --> 1:09:38.320]  taxes they couldn't and so now they're creating the global fund the green fund
[1:09:38.320 --> 1:09:43.080]  to go buy off government shut down their development morey strong and others can
[1:09:43.080 --> 1:09:47.200]  suck more money out like they did with the oil for food program so sir breaking
[1:09:47.200 --> 1:09:54.000]  down what really happened at Copenhagen the the dragon wounded but not slain yet
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:58.920]  and then getting into what their current agenda is and the latest on the
[1:09:58.920 --> 1:10:03.320]  climategate investigation the criminal investigations that have been initiated
[1:10:03.320 --> 1:10:07.160]  in different parts of the globe sir you have the floor thank you for joining us
[1:10:07.160 --> 1:10:12.360]  to brief our listeners well Alex I'm going to continue with your military
[1:10:12.360 --> 1:10:18.600]  metaphor and I'm going to take a kind of three-minute timeout because I'm going
[1:10:18.600 --> 1:10:24.800]  to recite to you now an address which was given by Abraham Lincoln in a
[1:10:24.800 --> 1:10:29.800]  weedy voice holding the paper very close to his face on the battlefield of
[1:10:29.800 --> 1:10:34.800]  Gettysburg this is what he said four score and seven years ago our fathers
[1:10:34.800 --> 1:10:41.000]  brought forth on this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:46.640]  to the proposition that all men are created equal now we are engaged in a
[1:10:46.640 --> 1:10:52.360]  great civil war testing whether that nation or any nation so conceived and
[1:10:52.360 --> 1:10:58.800]  so dedicated can long endure we are met on a great battlefield of that war we
[1:10:58.800 --> 1:11:03.720]  have come to dedicate a portion of that field as a final resting place for those
[1:11:03.720 --> 1:11:08.720]  who here gave their lives that that nation might live it is all together
[1:11:08.720 --> 1:11:13.960]  fitting and proper that we should do this but in a larger sense we cannot
[1:11:13.960 --> 1:11:18.760]  dedicate we cannot concentrate we cannot allow this grant the brave men
[1:11:18.760 --> 1:11:24.160]  living and dead who struggled here have consecrated it far beyond our poor power
[1:11:24.160 --> 1:11:30.280]  to add or detract the world will little note no longer remember what we say here
[1:11:30.280 --> 1:11:35.800]  but it can never forget what they did here it is for us the living rather to
[1:11:35.800 --> 1:11:40.680]  be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus
[1:11:40.680 --> 1:11:46.520]  far so nobly advanced it is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great
[1:11:46.520 --> 1:11:52.240]  task remaining before us that from these honored dead we take increased devotion
[1:11:52.240 --> 1:11:58.280]  to that cause which they gave the last full measure of devotion that we hear
[1:11:58.280 --> 1:12:04.800]  highly resolved that these dead shall not have died in vain that this nation
[1:12:04.800 --> 1:12:10.760]  under God shall have a new birth of freedom and that government of the
[1:12:10.760 --> 1:12:18.320]  people by the people for the people shall not perish from the earth now
[1:12:18.320 --> 1:12:23.640]  that's what he said and that's what I want to talk about now because let us
[1:12:23.640 --> 1:12:29.120]  prepare that there is a case for doing something about the climate there isn't
[1:12:29.120 --> 1:12:32.800]  but let's pretend there is let's propose that even if there's a scientific case
[1:12:32.800 --> 1:12:38.080]  there was an economic case there isn't but let's pretend that there is if we're
[1:12:38.080 --> 1:12:44.320]  going to have multilateral acts if we're going to have a global government then
[1:12:44.320 --> 1:12:51.000]  honoring what it was that those gallant men at Gettysburg died for we want to
[1:12:51.000 --> 1:12:56.800]  make sure that that government shall be a government of the people by the people
[1:12:56.800 --> 1:13:02.640]  for the people it should be an elected government and I think that what I would
[1:13:02.640 --> 1:13:08.920]  like everyone who is listening today to do is to get in touch by telephone with
[1:13:08.920 --> 1:13:13.280]  their elected representatives both in Congress and your senators both your
[1:13:13.280 --> 1:13:20.400]  senators and say that if we are to go any further whatsoever towards paying
[1:13:20.400 --> 1:13:25.520]  taxpayers money towards this high-level panel or this Copenhagen green fund
[1:13:25.520 --> 1:13:31.280]  these first steps towards what would have been a much grander world government
[1:13:31.280 --> 1:13:36.520]  unless we stopped it at Copenhagen but it may still come to that we want to make
[1:13:36.520 --> 1:13:41.920]  sure that if there's going to be a world government it should be an elected
[1:13:41.920 --> 1:13:47.560]  world government elected by the people of the world and not appointed by the
[1:13:47.560 --> 1:13:52.640]  bureaucrats of the world as is at present intent now I put it to you Alex
[1:13:52.640 --> 1:13:57.960]  that is a sensible point we're saying if there is a problem with the climate
[1:13:57.960 --> 1:14:03.360]  with you and I don't believe there is if there is an economic solution to it with
[1:14:03.360 --> 1:14:08.160]  you and I don't think there is if we must have a global government with you
[1:14:08.160 --> 1:14:12.520]  and I don't think we should have then I'm sure that everybody who is a true
[1:14:12.520 --> 1:14:18.760]  American and a follower of links will admit that that is to be an elected
[1:14:18.760 --> 1:14:24.600]  government and not an appointed and so what we've got to do is stop this step
[1:14:24.600 --> 1:14:30.040]  by step crab-wise approach towards the global government which is what they're
[1:14:30.040 --> 1:14:36.200]  now going to try to do because so many of your listeners Alex got onto their
[1:14:36.200 --> 1:14:40.720]  senators before and said the Treaty of Copenhagen in its original draft which I
[1:14:40.720 --> 1:14:44.480]  warned you about the world government reasons shall not pass we will not have
[1:14:44.480 --> 1:14:49.240]  it so many of you actually did that but the Democrat senators in particular got
[1:14:49.240 --> 1:14:53.040]  in touch with President Obama and said we can't have this we're not having it
[1:14:53.040 --> 1:14:58.360]  we'll never get it through we'll never be voted for yet if we throw away the
[1:14:58.360 --> 1:15:03.640]  democracy for which our people at Gettysburg died and our people are still
[1:15:03.640 --> 1:15:09.720]  dying for it our gallant truth now yours and us in Afghanistan and in Iraq and
[1:15:09.720 --> 1:15:16.000]  these lies must not be thrown away in vain government of the people by the
[1:15:16.000 --> 1:15:22.880]  people for the people that is what the United States is all about and any
[1:15:22.880 --> 1:15:28.720]  administration that tries to transfer power away from the Congress that you
[1:15:28.720 --> 1:15:34.480]  the people elect towards some alien bureaucratic centralist dismal
[1:15:34.480 --> 1:15:39.880]  dictatorship somewhere else is as you have rightly said committing high
[1:15:39.880 --> 1:15:45.040]  treason and should be flown from office and impeached am I putting this to
[1:15:45.040 --> 1:15:50.200]  stop it you know sir and I've noticed you have a great knowledge of our
[1:15:50.200 --> 1:15:56.440]  system of government here but being a lord in your system of government in
[1:15:56.440 --> 1:16:03.640]  your system when you have Gordon Brown saying I don't care if the nations
[1:16:03.640 --> 1:16:08.960]  didn't sign on to this I'm setting up this fund and we'll now have Europe the
[1:16:08.960 --> 1:16:14.680]  UK and the United States and Canada New Zealand Australia and others he calls
[1:16:14.680 --> 1:16:20.600]  them the Commonwealth's sign on to this and start putting money into what he
[1:16:20.600 --> 1:16:24.960]  and others have called global governance global government I mean that is open
[1:16:24.960 --> 1:16:29.640]  tyranny so can you speak to that specifically under your law and our law
[1:16:29.640 --> 1:16:34.320]  and then to have Schwarzenegger I know you were there so you're aware of it all
[1:16:34.320 --> 1:16:39.440]  over the news saying well I'm just gonna have a governor's conference meet that
[1:16:39.440 --> 1:16:43.160]  he's calling himself and I'm gonna have a group of mayors meet and we're going to
[1:16:43.160 --> 1:16:47.720]  implement this taxation system even if the Senate won't and a week before
[1:16:47.720 --> 1:16:54.360]  Copenhagen ended you said they may not get this through but they are still
[1:16:54.360 --> 1:16:58.800]  going to try to implement it through the bureaucracy and through the local
[1:16:58.800 --> 1:17:02.600]  governments so the federal bureaucracies in the local governments I mean is that
[1:17:02.600 --> 1:17:09.360]  not glaring sedition to have some usurping foreign-born governor running
[1:17:09.360 --> 1:17:15.520]  around organizing the states and then to have Obama who can't get the Senate to
[1:17:15.520 --> 1:17:19.200]  pass it it looks like just saying he'll just take money from the Treasury and
[1:17:19.200 --> 1:17:24.120]  serve it up to Ban Ki-moon and Maury strong I mean it's just outrageously
[1:17:24.120 --> 1:17:30.600]  openly fraudulent and criminal well certainly under our Constitution such as
[1:17:30.600 --> 1:17:36.360]  it is that we don't have a written one like you no money can be handed away by
[1:17:36.360 --> 1:17:41.320]  the government to anyone unless Parliament has authorized it now the
[1:17:41.320 --> 1:17:46.600]  trouble is at the moment that our Parliament is a lot of poodle and they
[1:17:46.600 --> 1:17:50.920]  are both the major parties at all three of them the bigger parties all believe
[1:17:50.920 --> 1:17:54.680]  in this climate nonsense and if Gordon Brown says to them never mind that our
[1:17:54.680 --> 1:17:59.280]  own people are starving and going faster the record rate we must give their
[1:17:59.280 --> 1:18:03.680]  money away to save the planet from this non-problems of the climate
[1:18:03.680 --> 1:18:07.600]  unfortunate I think it's quite likely that in any budget in which he writes
[1:18:07.600 --> 1:18:11.800]  such a provision in our Parliament would probably be like a poodle and just vote
[1:18:11.800 --> 1:18:17.320]  for it at the moment because reality has not yet broken through among our
[1:18:17.320 --> 1:18:22.400]  governing class here now in the United States I'm less familiar with exactly
[1:18:22.400 --> 1:18:27.240]  what powers the president has under his executive authority to allocate money
[1:18:27.240 --> 1:18:32.000]  from the Treasury or the Fed to whatever project he fancies but I think I
[1:18:32.000 --> 1:18:36.080]  like it sir it's totally illegal he can't do it and Congress is already
[1:18:36.080 --> 1:18:42.640]  saying that 18 was 14 now 18 Attorney Generals are saying they may file suit
[1:18:42.640 --> 1:18:47.720]  over not just that but his health care I mean everything he's doing is unconstitutional
[1:18:47.720 --> 1:18:52.280]  I think this often happens on the left these days they he knows that Obama knows
[1:18:52.280 --> 1:18:56.960]  from his plummeting ratings in the opinion poll that he's not long for this
[1:18:56.960 --> 1:19:03.320]  world he will be a lame duck president from this December once the mid-term
[1:19:03.320 --> 1:19:06.280]  elections for the entire House of Representatives well as a third of the
[1:19:06.280 --> 1:19:11.120]  Senate have been held he knows this now and so in panic he is trying to do what
[1:19:11.120 --> 1:19:14.640]  the left always do which is pay no attention to the Constitution use
[1:19:14.640 --> 1:19:20.360]  taxpayers money to fund his friends and set up various bureaucracies that will
[1:19:20.360 --> 1:19:24.760]  go on representing the extreme left-mars point of view even once he has
[1:19:24.760 --> 1:19:30.360]  been deservedly slung out of office but I'm hoping that if you've got as many as
[1:19:30.360 --> 1:19:37.440]  as 18 ex-Attorneys General willing to file suit and say just a moment you can't
[1:19:37.440 --> 1:19:42.520]  spend taxpayers money without the authorization of Congress then even
[1:19:42.520 --> 1:19:47.880]  Obama's poodles on the Supreme Court which at the moment seems to me just
[1:19:47.880 --> 1:19:51.520]  about the weakest part of the Constitution because it's not up only to
[1:19:51.520 --> 1:19:57.200]  come in the way that it's good I don't think even there can go along with the
[1:19:57.200 --> 1:20:01.160]  with Obama's anti with the kind of hold it there Lord Monkton we'll be right
[1:20:01.160 --> 1:20:07.240]  back hi this is Steve shank Alex and I have talked about food security for your

[1:22:12.280 --> 1:22:16.200]  that we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home I've
[1:22:16.200 --> 1:22:20.720]  turned in medicine influence on our president in Congress and they really
[1:22:20.720 --> 1:22:25.520]  are calling the shots I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American

[1:24:36.840 --> 1:24:39.240]  and I want to get to the latest on climategate but I think the overwhelming
[1:24:39.240 --> 1:24:44.360]  point you've made here is we've had a giant victory and we can feel the
[1:24:44.360 --> 1:24:48.520]  momentum shifting in our direction but still the hundreds of billions globally
[1:24:48.520 --> 1:24:53.400]  invested in the fraud in the global government in the taxation scheme as the
[1:24:53.400 --> 1:24:57.440]  foundation of this illegal unelected global government they're not going to
[1:24:57.440 --> 1:25:03.000]  stop they're going to keep pushing though badly damaged and so it's up to the
[1:25:03.000 --> 1:25:06.920]  people to contact their senators their representatives their state leaders and
[1:25:06.920 --> 1:25:13.520]  say no no no please continue Lord Monkton then let's get into climategate
[1:25:13.520 --> 1:25:17.120]  the latest developments there yeah first of all just to get it get the point of
[1:25:17.120 --> 1:25:21.240]  what you need to say now when you talk to your representative say that if there
[1:25:21.240 --> 1:25:26.720]  must be any kind of global government it must be elected by the peoples of the
[1:25:26.720 --> 1:25:32.000]  world and not appointed by government or by bureaucrats it's got to be elected
[1:25:32.000 --> 1:25:37.960]  and that will stop the nonsense faster than anything so now on to the latest on
[1:25:37.960 --> 1:25:44.200]  climategate I've now heard from the chairman of the independent inquiry
[1:25:44.200 --> 1:25:47.520]  into climategate because I wrote to him and said I want to give evidence of this
[1:25:47.520 --> 1:25:51.520]  he says that he's just about to appoint a team to look at who's going to give
[1:25:51.520 --> 1:25:55.560]  evidence who isn't and at that point they'll get back to me so that is slowly
[1:25:55.560 --> 1:26:01.800]  happening more interestingly arising out of climategate there is now a general
[1:26:01.800 --> 1:26:08.280]  move in the air that those who have been peddling this climate scare for so long
[1:26:08.280 --> 1:26:13.880]  and who have quite wrongly claimed the moral high ground are now losing it not
[1:26:13.880 --> 1:26:17.840]  only because the science doesn't work out not only because there's no economic
[1:26:17.840 --> 1:26:21.840]  case even if the science does work out not only because even if we had to have
[1:26:21.840 --> 1:26:26.840]  something to do economically with it we don't need a global government to do
[1:26:26.840 --> 1:26:31.200]  it not even because even if we do have a global government it must be an elected
[1:26:31.200 --> 1:26:35.720]  local government at the moment they're planning not to but the reason why they've
[1:26:35.720 --> 1:26:41.600]  lost the moral authority above all else is that it is becoming apparent that you
[1:26:41.600 --> 1:26:48.480]  are quite right when you use words like criminal and fraud about what's going on
[1:26:48.480 --> 1:26:54.880]  and for instance the chairman of the IPCC science panel doctor Rajendra
[1:26:54.880 --> 1:27:01.720]  Pachauri when I was in Copenhagen I went to hear him give a lecture and it was a
[1:27:01.720 --> 1:27:05.080]  lecture on why it is that the climate is all terrible and we've got to do
[1:27:05.080 --> 1:27:10.760]  something about it and I knew that he would use and he duly did use a bogus
[1:27:10.760 --> 1:27:16.360]  graph that appears three times large and in full color in the latest UN
[1:27:16.360 --> 1:27:22.360]  document published in 2010 about climate an entirely bogus graph which was
[1:27:22.360 --> 1:27:28.000]  created using a false and well-known false and fraudulent statistical technique
[1:27:28.000 --> 1:27:33.760]  try to pretend quite falsely that the rate of warming is itself increasing and
[1:27:33.760 --> 1:27:38.280]  I confronted him as he arrived that lecture and handed him a detailed letter
[1:27:38.280 --> 1:27:43.240]  from me explaining what was wrong with this graph telling him not to use it and
[1:27:43.240 --> 1:27:47.960]  asking him to get back to me within 48 hours to say that that graph would no
[1:27:47.960 --> 1:27:52.960]  longer be used either by him or by the IPCC and that this kind of fraud would
[1:27:52.960 --> 1:27:57.800]  in the future be visited from I also raised the question at the end of his
[1:27:57.800 --> 1:28:01.760]  speech having seen him use the graph saying look you've used it again and
[1:28:01.760 --> 1:28:05.600]  this is a bogus graph and I'm going to give you 48 hours to get back to me he
[1:28:05.600 --> 1:28:12.240]  didn't get back to me of course it's 48 hours and I am now reporting it to the
[1:28:12.240 --> 1:28:18.640]  police in India for scientific and financial fraud because he has a large
[1:28:18.640 --> 1:28:25.280]  financial vested interest in numerous corporations and quangos and you were
[1:28:25.280 --> 1:28:29.080]  saying that a year ago to money out of the time it's gap sir to interrupt you
[1:28:29.080 --> 1:28:33.000]  you were saying a year ago that he was involved it's finally all over British
[1:28:33.000 --> 1:28:38.760]  and US papers that they're shutting down famous steel plants in England to open
[1:28:38.760 --> 1:28:43.200]  them up in India when he's one of the big owners that's right and he's making
[1:28:43.200 --> 1:28:47.760]  money out of that we've lost 1700 jobs in the north of England just in the last
[1:28:47.760 --> 1:28:52.520]  month as a result of the closure of a major steel work that red car that has
[1:28:52.520 --> 1:28:56.160]  now been transferred to India where they're going to build exactly the
[1:28:56.160 --> 1:29:00.440]  same steelwork and they're going to be making money twice first of all because
[1:29:00.440 --> 1:29:04.560]  they get money from us because we're no longer doing the carbon emission and
[1:29:04.560 --> 1:29:09.400]  secondly because by using our steelwork and its technology they will be emitting
[1:29:09.400 --> 1:29:12.600]  less carbon than they would have been by any other method of field steel
[1:29:12.600 --> 1:29:17.080]  production and we are paying at both ends of this and our workers are losing their
[1:29:17.080 --> 1:29:23.880]  job now you British are paying to lose their jobs that's right we are paying
[1:29:23.880 --> 1:29:31.120]  a patch hour a personally to take 1700 of our workers job and transfer not the
[1:29:31.120 --> 1:29:37.160]  workers just jobs to India where he will make money again by various credit
[1:29:37.160 --> 1:29:41.200]  under the clean development mechanism which is what monster boondog was run
[1:29:41.200 --> 1:29:45.240]  by the UN it's unbelievable gotta break again long segment coming up let's go

[1:35:13.400 --> 1:35:18.720]  segments are for the brakes interrupting your your your your statements there we
[1:35:18.720 --> 1:35:24.960]  were getting into fraud and the head of the IPCC openly profiting with gordon
[1:35:24.960 --> 1:35:30.520]  brown paying taxpayer money to shut down ancient high quality jobs jobs that have
[1:35:30.520 --> 1:35:34.520]  been there for a long time to ship them there for his profit now there's so many
[1:35:34.520 --> 1:35:39.040]  other instances and there's the classic climategate emails been santa three
[1:35:39.040 --> 1:35:43.240]  weeks ago the interview aired on true tv top ratings for that show by the way
[1:35:43.240 --> 1:35:48.400]  number one show on true tv showing the interest were been santa admits finally
[1:35:48.400 --> 1:35:52.720]  admitting what you expose years ago that he removed five separate sections from
[1:35:52.720 --> 1:35:56.960]  the un IPCC report on man make global warming with her own scientists said
[1:35:56.960 --> 1:36:00.520]  man wasn't doing it perhaps we should revisit that and more of where
[1:36:00.520 --> 1:36:05.600]  climategate is right now lord mongin right well that's quite an agenda let's
[1:36:05.600 --> 1:36:11.000]  finish off on dr. Pachare shall we the other thing I've done is to report him
[1:36:11.000 --> 1:36:16.600]  to the british charity commission with a request that they should pass on the
[1:36:16.600 --> 1:36:22.360]  details to the police because he runs along with chris bintakel answer john
[1:36:22.360 --> 1:36:29.720]  horton who is the former chairman of the IPCC a charity called t eri europe that
[1:36:29.720 --> 1:36:35.120]  is the energy research institute europe founded originally by tata steel
[1:36:35.120 --> 1:36:40.240]  industries and of course it's tata steel which happens to be taking over this
[1:36:40.240 --> 1:36:46.080]  steel work of shutting it down in the uk and opening it in india to make more
[1:36:46.080 --> 1:36:52.080]  profit twice over out of our subsidies and destroying 1700 of our job well this
[1:36:52.080 --> 1:36:57.040]  man pachare because these jobs have been destroyed i'm now having a very close
[1:36:57.040 --> 1:37:01.120]  look at him and what he's doing to our people and I discovered he'd set up this
[1:37:01.120 --> 1:37:06.600]  charity along with the former chairman of the IPCC the UN climate panel john
[1:37:06.600 --> 1:37:11.920]  horton and that charity in each of the last three years has declared income of
[1:37:11.920 --> 1:37:17.240]  only seven or eight thousand sterling in fact in the last four years added
[1:37:17.240 --> 1:37:23.680]  together less than twenty five thousand sterling and yet on the website of the
[1:37:23.680 --> 1:37:28.040]  department of the environment here government department i have found a
[1:37:28.040 --> 1:37:37.560]  grant of thirty thousand four hundred seven seven hundred fourteen pounds just in one year two thousand six percent two the
[1:37:37.560 --> 1:37:42.840]  tata energy research institute europe this charity which has declared only
[1:37:42.840 --> 1:37:47.800]  twenty five thousand pounds of income in total over four years on one grant on
[1:37:47.800 --> 1:37:53.240]  one of its project it has received more than the money it's declared for four
[1:37:53.240 --> 1:37:59.600]  years now that is full accounting and i have asked for an explanation from the
[1:37:59.600 --> 1:38:04.120]  charity's commission there may be and let's be fair an innocent explanation
[1:38:04.120 --> 1:38:09.360]  but i'm bloated i can see one and what i think is building up here is a sense
[1:38:09.360 --> 1:38:13.800]  that these people thought that they had become above the law they thought they'd
[1:38:13.800 --> 1:38:17.720]  got the mainstream media where they wanted them that nobody would ask any
[1:38:17.720 --> 1:38:22.040]  questions about any of this that they could do what they like with British
[1:38:22.040 --> 1:38:28.360]  people's jobs American people's jobs have just been a large American aluminum
[1:38:28.360 --> 1:38:33.800]  smelter closed down again about two and a half thousand jobs destroyed overnight
[1:38:33.800 --> 1:38:39.160]  why because the company that ran it can no longer find anyone to sell it
[1:38:39.160 --> 1:38:43.400]  electricity to run the smelter with aluminum smelting takes a lot of
[1:38:43.400 --> 1:38:47.640]  electricity and because the green is in the environmental
[1:38:47.640 --> 1:38:52.120]  markets have gone around banning the building of new coal-fired power
[1:38:52.120 --> 1:38:55.400]  stations and also stopping nuclear ones being built
[1:38:55.400 --> 1:38:59.640]  America is running out of the energy that is needed to safeguard
[1:38:59.640 --> 1:39:04.280]  jobs meanwhile to interrupt major closures it's happening in Britain
[1:39:04.280 --> 1:39:09.320]  major closures major losses of jobs directly attributable to this
[1:39:09.320 --> 1:39:14.040]  financial and scientific fraud for that is what it now is
[1:39:14.040 --> 1:39:18.200]  and at a number of different places we're now getting investigation there is
[1:39:18.200 --> 1:39:21.560]  of course now the climate gate investigation
[1:39:21.560 --> 1:39:25.400]  now the original terms of reference for that were rather soft
[1:39:25.400 --> 1:39:29.000]  it was just a little bit of a slap on the wrist for the university for having
[1:39:29.000 --> 1:39:32.440]  perhaps not complied with the freedom of
[1:39:32.440 --> 1:39:36.120]  information act when other scientists ask for information that's bad enough
[1:39:36.120 --> 1:39:38.840]  heaven knows in a matter where they're about to spend
[1:39:38.840 --> 1:39:42.040]  trillions on the basis of these scientists is work we can't check
[1:39:42.040 --> 1:39:46.920]  because they won't give us their data but on top of that I have now written to
[1:39:46.920 --> 1:39:50.840]  the chairman of this if an inquiry who's been appointed and I've said look
[1:39:50.840 --> 1:39:54.600]  mate there is a large scientific and financial
[1:39:54.600 --> 1:40:00.440]  fraud underlying all this and since I am named in these climate gate emails
[1:40:00.440 --> 1:40:04.120]  because they don't like me very much as you can imagine these nasty scientists
[1:40:04.120 --> 1:40:08.760]  who are trying to undermine the world with their bogus science
[1:40:08.760 --> 1:40:12.120]  I've said they've named me in very uncomplimentary terms
[1:40:12.120 --> 1:40:15.720]  in these emails I want the right of reply by giving
[1:40:15.720 --> 1:40:19.240]  by having the right to explain to the inquiry
[1:40:19.240 --> 1:40:25.400]  why I say that it is a financial and scientific fraud and I'm going to
[1:40:25.400 --> 1:40:30.360]  produce all the evidence I've built up of what these particular people
[1:40:30.360 --> 1:40:34.360]  who are named in the climate gate emails as writing to each other
[1:40:34.360 --> 1:40:38.920]  in further of the report I'm going to show what they've done over the years
[1:40:38.920 --> 1:40:42.760]  I gave a presentation on this in Copenhagen and you should have seen the
[1:40:42.760 --> 1:40:46.440]  jaws dropping all around the room as I said I've been following all these
[1:40:46.440 --> 1:40:50.520]  people for years I've been watching them committing scientific fraud
[1:40:50.520 --> 1:40:54.520]  I've suspected all along that they were linked and now we have the evidence
[1:40:54.520 --> 1:40:58.040]  thanks to the climate gate whistleblower showing that they are linked
[1:40:58.040 --> 1:41:02.200]  this is an organized conspiracy of not very many people
[1:41:02.200 --> 1:41:05.160]  you know it's not as though we're talking of thousands of scientists as
[1:41:05.160 --> 1:41:08.760]  conspiracy it's about two dozen who have effectively
[1:41:08.760 --> 1:41:12.760]  driven the whole share by being absolutely
[1:41:12.760 --> 1:41:15.960]  vision to any scientist who dared to disagree with them
[1:41:15.960 --> 1:41:19.000]  they've had scientists sacked from their jobs they've had them threatened
[1:41:19.000 --> 1:41:22.200]  they've had them bullied they've denied access to the peer-reviewed journals
[1:41:22.200 --> 1:41:24.280]  for them they've stopped them getting their material
[1:41:24.280 --> 1:41:27.880]  into the UN climate report these people have been
[1:41:27.880 --> 1:41:33.560]  driving this care and they have been so nasty that they've terrified
[1:41:33.560 --> 1:41:38.280]  ordinary scientists who aren't very political and aren't very strong willed
[1:41:38.280 --> 1:41:43.080]  into silence so that they could then claim that because none of these scientists
[1:41:43.080 --> 1:41:45.720]  dare to argue with the affair of losing their job
[1:41:45.720 --> 1:41:50.040]  therefore there is a consensus and then of course is the nastiest kind of fraud
[1:41:50.040 --> 1:41:55.720]  Lord Monkton and then when they scientists 31,000 did try to testify last
[1:41:55.720 --> 1:41:59.000]  year in congress they were blocked from being able to testify
[1:41:59.000 --> 1:42:02.040]  even though they've been persecuted but expanding on that
[1:42:02.040 --> 1:42:05.960]  i saw a number in the bbc just a month ago
[1:42:05.960 --> 1:42:09.960]  of china opening a new cold powered plant
[1:42:09.960 --> 1:42:14.520]  every two and a half days and right here in texas in east texas i have some
[1:42:14.520 --> 1:42:17.720]  family land and a family that lives there
[1:42:17.720 --> 1:42:21.960]  and they were going to build a new clean burning coal plant
[1:42:21.960 --> 1:42:25.720]  to power several new factories that we're going to be moving in
[1:42:25.720 --> 1:42:29.560]  and none of that happened because local environmentalist
[1:42:29.560 --> 1:42:33.160]  under green funding from the UN and the federal government
[1:42:33.160 --> 1:42:37.480]  ran around terrorizing and threatening lawsuits and it didn't happen
[1:42:37.480 --> 1:42:41.560]  and so those plants were not built anywhere in the united states it was
[1:42:41.560 --> 1:42:44.920]  multiple clean burning cold powered plants
[1:42:44.920 --> 1:42:48.840]  that literally nothing comes out of there but steam and carbon dioxide
[1:42:48.840 --> 1:42:52.680]  and and and we see al gore we see the government
[1:42:52.680 --> 1:42:55.960]  we see morris strong we see george soros
[1:42:55.960 --> 1:42:59.400]  they control and you've spoken about this but if you can elaborate briefly
[1:42:59.400 --> 1:43:03.000]  about how they get to decide where the federal money goes
[1:43:03.000 --> 1:43:07.720]  for new energy and it's always invested with their companies that they make
[1:43:07.720 --> 1:43:10.440]  profits from i mean this isn't just them trying to set up a
[1:43:10.440 --> 1:43:14.120]  global government tax system it's a new dark age where
[1:43:14.120 --> 1:43:18.200]  they are the only people that get a letter of marker license
[1:43:18.200 --> 1:43:24.360]  from this new imperial crown of the UN to be able to even engage in any type of
[1:43:24.360 --> 1:43:29.000]  manufacturing and of course what is egregiously terrifying
[1:43:29.000 --> 1:43:31.720]  about all this is that you quite rightly laid
[1:43:31.720 --> 1:43:37.160]  stress on the fact that the 157 um co-fired plants throughout the
[1:43:37.160 --> 1:43:39.880]  united states that are now on the whole because of
[1:43:39.880 --> 1:43:44.040]  environmental activism of the nastiest kind exactly the same
[1:43:44.040 --> 1:43:47.160]  threat of bullying which the scientists are doing to be to each other
[1:43:47.160 --> 1:43:50.840]  is being done by the environmentalists to the co-corporations and to the
[1:43:50.840 --> 1:43:53.160]  businesses that want to set up factories or run their
[1:43:53.160 --> 1:43:58.520]  aluminum smelters um these people are saying that you can't build these
[1:43:58.520 --> 1:44:01.400]  co-fired plants here so what's happening is
[1:44:01.400 --> 1:44:05.560]  china is building them over in china how do we know
[1:44:05.560 --> 1:44:10.840]  because the chinese administration publishes every year what's called the
[1:44:10.840 --> 1:44:14.920]  annual statistical communique of the people in public of china and in that
[1:44:14.920 --> 1:44:18.680]  communique they said two years ago they were going to continue regardless of
[1:44:18.680 --> 1:44:21.800]  what the UN said and they were going to build
[1:44:21.800 --> 1:44:27.880]  one or two co-fired power plants every week for the foreseeable future every
[1:44:27.880 --> 1:44:31.880]  week it means that in one year they will have built
[1:44:31.880 --> 1:44:35.960]  almost as many co-fired plants as the environmentalists have stopped being
[1:44:35.960 --> 1:44:39.160]  built in the united states for the over the last 10 years lord
[1:44:39.160 --> 1:44:42.440]  montan and those are dirty dirty plants burning dirty
[1:44:42.440 --> 1:44:45.880]  co with huge pollutants the asian brown hay
[1:44:45.880 --> 1:44:51.320]  is the only artifact of man that can be seen from space during the day
[1:44:51.320 --> 1:44:56.200]  absolutely and and again is this not economic espionage where morris
[1:44:56.200 --> 1:45:00.680]  strong and the rockefellers and others openly are the bigger investors in china
[1:45:00.680 --> 1:45:03.800]  they're all making money there's no environmental standards
[1:45:03.800 --> 1:45:07.720]  and they're trying to deindustrialize the united states as morris strong has
[1:45:07.720 --> 1:45:11.080]  stated they're doing this to england they're doing this to europe
[1:45:11.080 --> 1:45:14.440]  making europe completely dependent on russian natural gas
[1:45:14.440 --> 1:45:17.320]  i mean this is just the more you look at this crime
[1:45:17.320 --> 1:45:21.160]  it's so diabolical it's so multifaceted it's so
[1:45:21.160 --> 1:45:25.160]  incredibly evil uh how do we stop this fraud
[1:45:25.160 --> 1:45:28.280]  i think what you do is do exactly what you're doing now you
[1:45:28.280 --> 1:45:32.120]  tell the people of the united states that it is happening and in the end
[1:45:32.120 --> 1:45:35.080]  they weren't tolerated let me give you just one example picking up on your
[1:45:35.080 --> 1:45:38.920]  point there about the natural gas now
[1:45:38.920 --> 1:45:45.000]  every day in the north slope of alaska where there is an oil
[1:45:45.000 --> 1:45:50.520]  field they flare off enough natural gas to supply
[1:45:50.520 --> 1:45:54.760]  the whole of western europe now if it were not
[1:45:54.760 --> 1:45:58.760]  for these again these environmentally who have stopped
[1:45:58.760 --> 1:46:02.200]  that gas pipeline from being built from the north slope
[1:46:02.200 --> 1:46:07.080]  down to the ice free ports of southern alaska across alaska
[1:46:07.080 --> 1:46:10.840]  if that pipeline had been allowed then i could send
[1:46:10.840 --> 1:46:18.120]  four large super tankers every day to anchorage let's say pick up the gas
[1:46:18.120 --> 1:46:22.440]  from there fail it to grainge mouth plug it into the european gas
[1:46:22.440 --> 1:46:26.200]  network there and i could supply the whole of europe
[1:46:26.200 --> 1:46:30.440]  on gas which at the moment is being burnt to the atmosphere creating
[1:46:30.440 --> 1:46:33.880]  enormous output with co2 which is what they say they're worried about
[1:46:33.880 --> 1:46:37.400]  well at least something good happens in the north slope of alaska that is how
[1:46:37.400 --> 1:46:41.400]  mad all of it is not just that it's bad but it and it which it is
[1:46:41.400 --> 1:46:44.920]  and all these people making fortunes i mean there's there's the regiment
[1:46:44.920 --> 1:46:49.320]  ross child prince he's just opened a huge gold mine
[1:46:49.320 --> 1:46:53.560]  in russia it's making them are you making millions and millions and
[1:46:53.560 --> 1:46:57.160]  millions out of it and they're all doing it i mean in in some ways good good
[1:46:57.160 --> 1:46:59.960]  luck to them it's good that they're making money but
[1:46:59.960 --> 1:47:03.240]  what they're also doing is using their financial power
[1:47:03.240 --> 1:47:06.920]  to lobby against innocent businesses in the united states
[1:47:06.920 --> 1:47:10.520]  such as that aluminum melted such as all these coal-fired power stations and
[1:47:10.520 --> 1:47:13.560]  nuclear-fired power stations that are so necessary
[1:47:13.560 --> 1:47:17.560]  lobbying against the building of the gas pipeline that could liberate europe
[1:47:17.560 --> 1:47:22.440]  from russian gas and keep us with our independence and get the gas from what
[1:47:22.440 --> 1:47:26.680]  now being simply wasted to the to the this is monopoly capitalism
[1:47:26.680 --> 1:47:30.120]  this is monopoly capitalism well we're running out of time here
[1:47:30.120 --> 1:47:33.640]  and i know there's so many other uh... important points that uh... you can
[1:47:33.640 --> 1:47:37.080]  relay uh... to our audience uh... lord montan
[1:47:37.080 --> 1:47:39.720]  if the pendulum swinging against these people
[1:47:39.720 --> 1:47:43.320]  and the public's now beginning to learn the some of the magnitude not even
[1:47:43.320 --> 1:47:48.040]  the full magnitude of the fraud where do we go
[1:47:48.040 --> 1:47:51.480]  from here right i think the next step is this that
[1:47:51.480 --> 1:47:55.400]  um... the first thing the u n is going to try at least i would if i was
[1:47:55.400 --> 1:48:00.600]  in its shoes is to bring forward the next annual conference of the state
[1:48:00.600 --> 1:48:03.240]  parties of the framework conventional climate change
[1:48:03.240 --> 1:48:07.000]  which was due to be in mexico next december to pick up from what cobert
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:10.280]  hagan did they may try to bring that forward until
[1:48:10.280 --> 1:48:15.160]  june because they don't want to fight after the next midterm elections in
[1:48:15.160 --> 1:48:18.840]  the united states that they can no longer get any legislation
[1:48:18.840 --> 1:48:22.280]  uh... on their side through either house of congress
[1:48:22.280 --> 1:48:25.320]  and that's what will happen i think after the next midterm elections because
[1:48:25.320 --> 1:48:29.880]  people do listen to your program alex they listen to the other programs that
[1:48:29.880 --> 1:48:33.880]  i talk on quite regularly and they are getting the message
[1:48:33.880 --> 1:48:37.080]  that they are now governed by people who really
[1:48:37.080 --> 1:48:39.960]  seriously mean them harm and i'm sorry to
[1:48:39.960 --> 1:48:44.280]  if you like intervene as a brit in the in u.s politics and if there are any
[1:48:44.280 --> 1:48:48.200]  supporters of president obama listening to this then i do apologize you for
[1:48:48.200 --> 1:48:54.440]  having to say this but he is now a danger to the united states of america in
[1:48:54.440 --> 1:48:58.360]  particular to the danger a danger to the working people of the united
[1:48:58.360 --> 1:49:01.000]  states of america because those of the people it's the people who run the
[1:49:01.000 --> 1:49:04.840]  aluminum melted the people who would be taking the cold that can't now be dug
[1:49:04.840 --> 1:49:08.120]  who would be running the power stations that can't be built who would be
[1:49:08.120 --> 1:49:11.320]  working in those factories uh... factories in texas that you mentioned
[1:49:11.320 --> 1:49:14.760]  that would have been driven by the power stations that can't be built
[1:49:14.760 --> 1:49:18.280]  these are the people the working people who are gradually
[1:49:18.280 --> 1:49:22.440]  by a thousand here and two thousand there losing their job
[1:49:22.440 --> 1:49:25.720]  with no hope of getting their jobs back
[1:49:25.720 --> 1:49:29.000]  because the industries in which they once worked or might have worked
[1:49:29.000 --> 1:49:32.760]  will never arrive again because you have an administration
[1:49:32.760 --> 1:49:38.520]  that is determined to shut america down well lord montan this is a global
[1:49:38.520 --> 1:49:43.400]  threat we face and as you said calling for a world freedom or world liberty
[1:49:43.400 --> 1:49:48.200]  party based in each sovereign nation we are facing a global threat it's good
[1:49:48.200 --> 1:49:51.560]  that i can warn people in england you can warn people in america
[1:49:51.560 --> 1:49:57.240]  we're facing the same threat so we know what we're dealing with here
[1:49:57.240 --> 1:50:00.680]  that's right this is a global threat and that you're right to remind people
[1:50:00.680 --> 1:50:04.120]  it's not just in the united states it's not just obama
[1:50:04.120 --> 1:50:09.240]  we've got kevin rudder in australia who spent i mean after he'd heard by
[1:50:09.240 --> 1:50:12.680]  minnesota speech in which i first drew attention to the world government
[1:50:12.680 --> 1:50:16.040]  provisions in the co-operate he devoted an entire
[1:50:16.040 --> 1:50:20.920]  speech of three courses of an hour to personally vilifying me
[1:50:20.920 --> 1:50:25.080]  and he was really angry that this plot to set up a world government has been
[1:50:25.080 --> 1:50:27.560]  exposed so he needs to be dealt with and i'm
[1:50:27.560 --> 1:50:31.240]  going to australia in two weeks time to do a tour of australia
[1:50:31.240 --> 1:50:36.280]  to let people hear the side of the story so the mainstream media simply won't
[1:50:36.280 --> 1:50:38.680]  tell them and let me tell you what's happening down there in australia at the
[1:50:38.680 --> 1:50:41.160]  moment the government and it was the previous
[1:50:41.160 --> 1:50:44.680]  administration so again i'm not making political points
[1:50:44.680 --> 1:50:48.360]  the previous conservative administration didn't deal
[1:50:48.360 --> 1:50:53.320]  with the u n by which to comply with the Kyoto protocol and cut their carbon
[1:50:53.320 --> 1:50:58.840]  emissions they said that if we designate the farmland of half of australia
[1:50:58.840 --> 1:51:02.520]  as being a carbon sink that can't be farmed
[1:51:02.520 --> 1:51:06.280]  then will that allow us to comply with our obligation other than Kyoto protocol
[1:51:06.280 --> 1:51:09.640]  and the u n for some amazing reason said yes to this
[1:51:09.640 --> 1:51:13.400]  and it means that that people who own thousands of acres of farmland
[1:51:13.400 --> 1:51:18.120]  are now suddenly not allowed to farm and they've been given no compensation
[1:51:18.120 --> 1:51:21.960]  at all so it's not only in america the terrible things are happening and people
[1:51:21.960 --> 1:51:25.720]  are losing their livelihood and of course the financial asset is there in
[1:51:25.720 --> 1:51:29.560]  their farmland because it's worthless now because nobody can do anything with it
[1:51:29.560 --> 1:51:33.720]  it's got to be left fallow and one poor farmer who
[1:51:33.720 --> 1:51:37.800]  has been heartbroken by this sudden unexpected
[1:51:37.800 --> 1:51:41.640]  loss of his livelihood and of the capital value of his farm without a
[1:51:41.640 --> 1:51:44.840]  penny at compensation from the australian government in the name of
[1:51:44.840 --> 1:51:48.360]  complying with his ludicrous Kyoto protocol has
[1:51:48.360 --> 1:51:52.920]  climbed up a television mass on his estate he's living halfway up it now
[1:51:52.920 --> 1:51:56.200]  with water only he's been on a on a hunger strike now for
[1:51:56.200 --> 1:52:03.080]  six long weeks um 42 days and i fear he's not long for this world
[1:52:03.080 --> 1:52:06.440]  but he is so angry at what has happened to him and yet not
[1:52:06.440 --> 1:52:10.840]  one of the mainstream news media has even reported
[1:52:10.840 --> 1:52:14.840]  that this is what's being done to farmers all across our trade and so you're going
[1:52:14.840 --> 1:52:18.440]  to break the blockade yeah the silence of the mainstream media
[1:52:18.440 --> 1:52:22.680]  is culpable and serious and something is going to have to be done about
[1:52:22.680 --> 1:52:25.720]  well that's obviously because they're very very scared of the truth and i
[1:52:25.720 --> 1:52:28.440]  have seen reports in australian news the last two years
[1:52:28.440 --> 1:52:32.040]  in a positive way saying isn't it great
[1:52:32.040 --> 1:52:36.200]  uh this farmer will not be paid and uh he no more sheep
[1:52:36.200 --> 1:52:40.280]  are no more corn and they just calmly announce and here in the u.s. they're
[1:52:40.280 --> 1:52:44.600]  talking about laying land off use and the supreme court rule with new london
[1:52:44.600 --> 1:52:48.840]  versus kilo that they can take your property without just compensation
[1:52:48.840 --> 1:52:52.920]  i mean this is the real heart of tyranny not just taking property and the power
[1:52:52.920 --> 1:52:56.520]  to tax the power to destroy and taxation without representation
[1:52:56.520 --> 1:53:01.240]  but now we'll just take your factories we'll give 25 billion dollars
[1:53:01.240 --> 1:53:05.240]  to the automakers as a bailout so they can move to russia
[1:53:05.240 --> 1:53:08.440]  move to eastern europe move to brazil move to china
[1:53:08.440 --> 1:53:13.000]  they're paying to move jobs they're paying to shut down farms and factories
[1:53:13.000 --> 1:53:16.760]  because once we're bankrupt we'll be fully dependent on the globalist that
[1:53:16.760 --> 1:53:19.880]  is their plan and you know uh as well as i lord mocton that
[1:53:19.880 --> 1:53:23.160]  the u.n. has stated this in their biological diversity assessments morris
[1:53:23.160 --> 1:53:28.440]  strung has said this this is just a a group wanting to visit
[1:53:28.440 --> 1:53:34.680]  neo feudalism and serfdom upon the planet so that they can play god uh and
[1:53:34.680 --> 1:53:38.760]  it's just it's just so outrageous to witness this unfolding
[1:53:38.760 --> 1:53:43.160]  and now listeners when you have heard what alex has just said you might have
[1:53:43.160 --> 1:53:49.240]  thought this is so extreme it's just silly the trouble is
[1:53:49.240 --> 1:53:52.360]  that this is actually happening the stories we are telling you
[1:53:52.360 --> 1:53:56.360]  are real factories being closed down big one
[1:53:56.360 --> 1:54:00.120]  in britain being closed down in the united states factories that would have
[1:54:00.120 --> 1:54:05.400]  opened not open in australia farmland being taken out of use
[1:54:05.400 --> 1:54:09.720]  and now by a new and pernicious extension of the doctrine of eminent
[1:54:09.720 --> 1:54:13.720]  domain not only can the state take away your land
[1:54:13.720 --> 1:54:17.240]  united state take it away without a penny of compensation
[1:54:17.240 --> 1:54:20.680]  as it's already doing in australia but all of this
[1:54:20.680 --> 1:54:26.680]  in the name of a problem that doesn't exist there is no climate problem
[1:54:26.680 --> 1:54:30.280]  the climate has always changed it always will humankind has a
[1:54:30.280 --> 1:54:35.320]  miniscule effect at the very worst we are a bit park player in all this
[1:54:35.320 --> 1:54:39.400]  there is no danger we could burn as much fossil fuel as we like
[1:54:39.400 --> 1:54:42.920]  create as much fuel as we like it wouldn't make any difference to the
[1:54:42.920 --> 1:54:48.360]  client but these people have managed by lying and lying and
[1:54:48.360 --> 1:54:52.840]  lying again to pretend that there is a problem where there isn't one
[1:54:52.840 --> 1:54:57.240]  and who is going to get hurt the most it's not the rich
[1:54:57.240 --> 1:55:01.960]  it's not the big boy it is the working class the people who voted
[1:55:01.960 --> 1:55:05.720]  in their million president obama who voted in their millions for kevin
[1:55:05.720 --> 1:55:09.480]  rodin australia who voted for gordon brown it is the working
[1:55:09.480 --> 1:55:14.920]  and we know and we know at its heart it's all about a population control to
[1:55:14.920 --> 1:55:18.120]  limit our numbers and that's why the un says they want to shut off the food of
[1:55:18.120 --> 1:55:21.240]  the third world you've pointed out this is a death sentence
[1:55:21.240 --> 1:55:25.400]  to the third world they're able to implement that and in closing
[1:55:25.400 --> 1:55:29.480]  obviously at circumstantial they always use unusually hot weather which is
[1:55:29.480 --> 1:55:32.920]  really normal uh in certain biosphere areas
[1:55:32.920 --> 1:55:37.400]  as to say oh look it's hot or oh look there's a dust storm
[1:55:37.400 --> 1:55:40.760]  certainly if they would have chosen global cooling as their fair mongering
[1:55:40.760 --> 1:55:45.240]  they would be using the news now that we see massive depths in india from record
[1:55:45.240 --> 1:55:49.720]  cold record cold in dc record snowfall record cold in
[1:55:49.720 --> 1:55:53.720]  areas of europe record cold in the last hundred years around the globe
[1:55:53.720 --> 1:55:57.720]  because as the satellite and ground data shows cooling for nine years
[1:55:57.720 --> 1:56:02.760]  what leveling out in the last 14 correct that's exactly right the last 15 years
[1:56:02.760 --> 1:56:06.120]  has been no significant warming and this winter
[1:56:06.120 --> 1:56:09.640]  is likely to be one of the closest six winters
[1:56:09.640 --> 1:56:13.640]  of the whole of the last 100 years now of course one bad winter
[1:56:13.640 --> 1:56:17.480]  doesn't make a trend but we have now had three bad winters
[1:56:17.480 --> 1:56:21.560]  on the trot in the northern hemisphere we've had three bad summers on the trot
[1:56:21.560 --> 1:56:24.360]  certainly in the united kingdom and what it didn't like in the state
[1:56:24.360 --> 1:56:30.200]  and so certainly uh we're not getting the pattern of relentless rapid warming
[1:56:30.200 --> 1:56:34.120]  which is what the model um predicted now of course again
[1:56:34.120 --> 1:56:37.560]  they will say that a short trend isn't necessarily the same thing as a long
[1:56:37.560 --> 1:56:40.120]  trend you can get down trends even in the uptrend
[1:56:40.120 --> 1:56:44.440]  yes you can but it's now becoming apparent that over the last 30 years we
[1:56:44.440 --> 1:56:48.440]  simply haven't seen anything like the warming that the models have predicted
[1:56:48.440 --> 1:56:51.640]  they have got it wrong exactly as we all said they had
[1:56:51.640 --> 1:56:56.680]  and have now no denying it and yet they are cruelly killing off the jobs of
[1:56:56.680 --> 1:57:00.600]  working people throughout the western world and all of this
[1:57:00.600 --> 1:57:04.520]  for a chimera all of this to make them sell rich
[1:57:04.520 --> 1:57:09.320]  at your expense and of course they also sell it as if they want to help the
[1:57:09.320 --> 1:57:13.720]  third world but their own admissions this would kill tens of millions a year
[1:57:13.720 --> 1:57:17.640]  who are on the verge on the edge of starvation this is a death sentence
[1:57:17.640 --> 1:57:21.640]  it already is killing tens of millions the awful thing is that the doubling of
[1:57:21.640 --> 1:57:24.920]  world food prices that was caused by the biofuel scam
[1:57:24.920 --> 1:57:28.120]  taking a third of the u.s. agricultural land out of
[1:57:28.120 --> 1:57:31.640]  producing food for people who need it and introducing fuel for
[1:57:31.640 --> 1:57:35.480]  clunk of the debt the effect of that at the double world food prices
[1:57:35.480 --> 1:57:39.560]  pricing food out so that poor people around the world can't afford it there
[1:57:39.560 --> 1:57:42.280]  have been major food rights in a dozen different regions
[1:57:42.280 --> 1:57:46.680]  people are being killed worldwide by the belief
[1:57:46.680 --> 1:57:50.120]  in global warming that is so fake and so both
[1:57:50.120 --> 1:57:53.800]  and that these profiteers are profiting out of the depth
[1:57:53.800 --> 1:57:57.480]  of millions in poorer countries and not a word of this
[1:57:57.480 --> 1:58:01.560]  is appearing in any of our mainstream music isn't that lord mongton
[1:58:01.560 --> 1:58:06.520]  genocide under the nurenberg code yes i think you make a very good point there
[1:58:06.520 --> 1:58:10.360]  and i think that if somebody were to bring al goh up in front of the
[1:58:10.360 --> 1:58:14.360]  international criminal court for having caused the depth of
[1:58:14.360 --> 1:58:19.080]  billions by the lies that he has been spreading a conviction would be
[1:58:19.080 --> 1:58:22.680]  found he would be found to have committed crimes against humanity
[1:58:22.680 --> 1:58:26.360]  and the penalties of those as various people have discovered
[1:58:26.360 --> 1:58:31.960]  recently is death lord mongton let me say bye to you during the break

[2:00:28.200 --> 2:00:32.920]  that sounds like strong words i don't have words to describe how bad this is
[2:00:32.920 --> 2:00:36.200]  they're brainwashing the children in every public school in america
[2:00:36.200 --> 2:00:40.040]  they have them coming home reporting their parents writing out eco cop reports on
[2:00:40.040 --> 2:00:44.120]  them it is orwellian and joining us uh from the
[2:00:44.120 --> 2:00:48.200]  land of eric blair known as george arwell is lord christopher montan
[2:00:48.200 --> 2:00:51.800]  third vi count of wrenchley and montan or montan and wrenchley
[2:00:51.800 --> 2:00:54.760]  we've got four minutes left sir you've got the floor
[2:00:54.760 --> 2:00:59.080]  as the leader in exposing these criminals uh and and their
[2:00:59.080 --> 2:01:04.040]  their tyranny their genocide uh final statements to all the troops out there
[2:01:04.040 --> 2:01:08.360]  that are looking for direction in this fight against these swindlers
[2:01:08.360 --> 2:01:12.520]  right the first thing is get on to the website at science and public policy
[2:01:12.520 --> 2:01:15.720]  dot org and see for yourself what the science
[2:01:15.720 --> 2:01:20.120]  really says how the economic really stack up what's happening in the climate
[2:01:20.120 --> 2:01:22.920]  you'll find that in our monthly co2 reports for instance
[2:01:22.920 --> 2:01:26.920]  of the whole segment called montan papers where i've written for the layman
[2:01:26.920 --> 2:01:31.160]  about the science of climate change so if you can see for yourself when i say
[2:01:31.160 --> 2:01:35.160]  there isn't a problem with the climate we're not causing global warming
[2:01:35.160 --> 2:01:39.560]  you'll realize i'm not just making it up there is massive evidence overwhelming
[2:01:39.560 --> 2:01:43.480]  evidence now that there is no climate problem that's point one
[2:01:43.480 --> 2:01:48.920]  point two you can see from the draft copenhagen treaty of
[2:01:48.920 --> 2:01:52.280]  september the 15th which i revealed to the world on
[2:01:52.280 --> 2:01:56.280]  october the 40th that they were trying to set up a world
[2:01:56.280 --> 2:01:59.960]  government using this climate scare as a trojan
[2:01:59.960 --> 2:02:04.440]  horse to get people to submit you must not
[2:02:04.440 --> 2:02:08.360]  submit you must insist to your representative
[2:02:08.360 --> 2:02:11.960]  that if there is to be a world government it must be elected you are
[2:02:11.960 --> 2:02:14.840]  governed by an elected congress at the moment
[2:02:14.840 --> 2:02:21.080]  do not allow your president to hand your democratic right away to a world
[2:02:21.080 --> 2:02:25.240]  government that has the power to order your elected congress about
[2:02:25.240 --> 2:02:28.440]  that's not what your constitutional founding fathers wanted
[2:02:28.440 --> 2:02:32.680]  so you must stand up for your constitution the next thing you must do
[2:02:32.680 --> 2:02:38.840]  is rally around the working people who are the people who are now beginning to
[2:02:38.840 --> 2:02:42.440]  suffer as a result of this global warming
[2:02:42.440 --> 2:02:46.280]  maniac scare working people who lost the jobs in
[2:02:46.280 --> 2:02:50.600]  that aluminum meltdown working people who lost their jobs because
[2:02:50.600 --> 2:02:54.680]  they would have been digging coal to supply 157
[2:02:54.680 --> 2:02:58.280]  coal-fired power stations that haven't been built they would have been running
[2:02:58.280 --> 2:03:01.240]  those power stations those power stations in turn
[2:03:01.240 --> 2:03:05.320]  would have been providing the factories that would have allowed your economy
[2:03:05.320 --> 2:03:09.320]  in texas and elsewhere to grow all of that is being
[2:03:09.320 --> 2:03:13.800]  stopped by the environmental marxist so that is what they are they don't care
[2:03:13.800 --> 2:03:17.880]  about the environment if they did they would allow power stations to be built
[2:03:17.880 --> 2:03:21.560]  in the united states and not to be built in china
[2:03:21.560 --> 2:03:25.560]  where the coal is burnt in a dirty way which pollutes the atmosphere in a way
[2:03:25.560 --> 2:03:29.240]  that it doesn't in the united states all of this has nothing
[2:03:29.240 --> 2:03:33.320]  whatever to do with the environment you should understand that
[2:03:33.320 --> 2:03:36.920]  nothing whatever to do with the environment it is only to do with power
[2:03:36.920 --> 2:03:40.600]  politics and the aim of this power politics
[2:03:40.600 --> 2:03:45.240]  is to dismantle the west to dismantle the united states
[2:03:45.240 --> 2:03:49.320]  to leave you and us and people and incapable
[2:03:49.320 --> 2:03:53.800]  so that a few very rich men and very rich corporations people like
[2:03:53.800 --> 2:03:59.400]  al goh who don't deserve to be rich they are the people who are profiteering
[2:03:59.400 --> 2:04:03.960]  out of the lies that they are spreading and you must help
[2:04:03.960 --> 2:04:08.040]  to if you find them telling lies complain to the police
[2:04:08.040 --> 2:04:11.640]  the police are beginning to take an interest in this fraud now
[2:04:11.640 --> 2:04:15.480]  complain to the police if you'll think you're being lied to just go into your
[2:04:15.480 --> 2:04:18.360]  local police station saying i've had enough of this look what it's costing
[2:04:18.360 --> 2:04:22.680]  in jobs and in money and in taxation complain to the police
[2:04:22.680 --> 2:04:26.280]  and make them investigate they have a duty to investigate fraud
[2:04:26.280 --> 2:04:29.960]  and a fraud is what this is it's the biggest fraud that's ever been
[2:04:29.960 --> 2:04:35.960]  perpetrated on the world and you must fight it or you will go under
[2:04:35.960 --> 2:04:40.280]  well said well done thank you so much lord montan for your
[2:04:40.280 --> 2:04:45.480]  leadership in Copenhagen as we blew up one of their larger capital ships but
[2:04:45.480 --> 2:04:48.280]  the fight is still on but we're learning that we can't have
[2:04:48.280 --> 2:04:52.040]  victory because we have the truth all they have is fraud lies
[2:04:52.040 --> 2:04:56.040]  corruption and genocide science and public policy dot org
[2:04:56.040 --> 2:04:59.480]  we'll talk to you sir when you get back from australia thank you so much for
[2:04:59.480 --> 2:05:03.000]  your time a real pleasure and thank you alex as always
[2:05:03.000 --> 2:05:06.360]  five reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[2:05:06.360 --> 2:05:10.200]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[2:05:10.200 --> 2:05:13.560]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[2:05:13.560 --> 2:05:17.160]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[2:05:17.160 --> 2:05:21.480]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[2:05:21.480 --> 2:05:25.720]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[2:05:25.720 --> 2:05:28.680]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[2:05:28.680 --> 2:05:32.520]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[2:05:32.520 --> 2:05:35.880]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose their
[2:05:35.880 --> 2:05:39.640]  power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator
[2:05:39.640 --> 2:05:42.520]  provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[2:05:42.520 --> 2:05:45.560]  folks i really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[2:09:04.520 --> 2:09:07.960]  sign of genius i'm not kidding when i say that we're
[2:09:07.960 --> 2:09:11.880]  being turned into complete mindless animals you try to talk to full grown
[2:09:11.880 --> 2:09:14.680]  adults they'd know nothing about the world they
[2:09:14.680 --> 2:09:17.560]  can hardly speak their vocabularies are tiny
[2:09:17.560 --> 2:09:21.320]  they're little jellyfish that watch television
[2:09:21.320 --> 2:09:24.120]  now we still have masses of people that are awake
[2:09:24.120 --> 2:09:27.960]  and growing numbers of people that are hyper awake so but you have a
[2:09:27.960 --> 2:09:31.720]  splitting of the wheat from the chaff from the gold from the
[2:09:31.720 --> 2:09:35.960]  pewter here in this global situation we face
[2:09:35.960 --> 2:09:38.680]  where either people are getting more awake or they're getting even more dumb
[2:09:38.680 --> 2:09:41.480]  down i'm going to get more into airport scanners
[2:09:41.480 --> 2:09:45.080]  going in nationwide including austin texas i'm calling for a global boycott

[2:09:51.240 --> 2:09:55.640]  i'll announce dates and other information but i would say coming up in about
[2:09:55.640 --> 2:09:59.880]  two months so we have time to hype it no one flying for a month
[2:09:59.880 --> 2:10:03.720]  uh in business talk to other businesses and say let's do video conferencing
[2:10:03.720 --> 2:10:06.840]  instead uh let's let the airlines know we're not
[2:10:06.840 --> 2:10:10.280]  putting up with this uh let's call the congress telling
[2:10:10.280 --> 2:10:14.360]  we know this is a boondog on a scam that's coming up i've got financial news
[2:10:14.360 --> 2:10:17.480]  coming up as well the latest on the underwear bomber
[2:10:17.480 --> 2:10:20.840]  but as promised i want to open the phones up to first
[2:10:20.840 --> 2:10:26.200]  time callers i did this yesterday on the first live show of the year sunday
[2:10:26.200 --> 2:10:30.040]  show this is the first weekday show of the year i want to do it again today
[2:10:30.040 --> 2:10:33.640]  about the genocide that lord montan was just discussing this is going on
[2:10:33.640 --> 2:10:37.400]  or the shutdown of our factories and our governments paying to move them to china
[2:10:37.400 --> 2:10:41.560]  where their dirty coal plants actually increasing
[2:10:41.560 --> 2:10:45.800]  the devilish co2 but actually putting out some real things like mercury
[2:10:45.800 --> 2:10:51.080]  and other particulars they're actually bad uh we need to discuss this we need to
[2:10:51.080 --> 2:10:55.240]  talk about this any issue you wish to discuss any question any comment you
[2:10:55.240 --> 2:10:58.520]  have for me toll free number to join us on air today
[2:10:58.520 --> 2:11:07.320]  1-800-259-9231 1-800-259-9231 on this
[2:11:07.320 --> 2:11:11.800]  monday january 4th 2010 well that's going to take some getting used to
[2:11:11.800 --> 2:11:16.600]  before we know it'll be 2011 then 2012 nothing's gonna happen in 2012
[2:11:16.600 --> 2:11:19.560]  but a bunch of cults committing suicide and things i'm sure
[2:11:19.560 --> 2:11:23.480]  and maybe a few terror events and i'm gonna make a film about 2012
[2:11:23.480 --> 2:11:26.600]  i'm gonna start it later this year and it'll be released in
[2:11:26.600 --> 2:11:31.160]  the middle of 2011 maybe earlier i've just got so many things i've
[2:11:31.160 --> 2:11:34.600]  got to get going here like daily news briefs i want to do
[2:11:34.600 --> 2:11:38.360]  the television studio we're building i've got so many other issues and goals i
[2:11:38.360 --> 2:11:40.840]  have to complete and i'm having to put films back
[2:11:40.840 --> 2:11:43.320]  uh because all of this is going on and happening
[2:11:43.320 --> 2:11:46.680]  filmmaking is the most time intensive thing i do next to four hours a day on
[2:11:46.680 --> 2:11:50.520]  the radio and several hours a day of preparation
[2:11:50.520 --> 2:11:55.880]  but uh a lot going on in 2010 i want to hear your commitments for 2010 to
[2:11:55.880 --> 2:11:59.320]  fight tyranny uh what you're committing to do in
[2:11:59.320 --> 2:12:03.080]  2010 what you think the globalists are going to launch in 2010
[2:12:03.080 --> 2:12:09.320]  1-800-259-9231 and i've made a new year's resolution
[2:12:09.320 --> 2:12:12.840]  to try to be at least some days a little more calm
[2:12:12.840 --> 2:12:16.440]  to be more controlled and more focused to try to cover more news and info
[2:12:16.440 --> 2:12:20.440]  and some days to take more calls some you'll still get the rants and things
[2:12:20.440 --> 2:12:24.120]  but that's really a product of me being undisciplined and doing so many hours
[2:12:24.120 --> 2:12:26.760]  of radio when i get tired and angry and just sick
[2:12:26.760 --> 2:12:31.400]  of all this crud i tend to blow up and that certainly is important to get
[2:12:31.400 --> 2:12:34.280]  angry at a core level but then to make that constructive and put it into
[2:12:34.280 --> 2:12:37.880]  solutions and action because that's what we're about here solutions
[2:12:37.880 --> 2:12:41.080]  and empowering the people to take action that's why we're the number one
[2:12:41.080 --> 2:12:45.320]  target of mainstream media demonization events the adl the southern
[2:12:45.320 --> 2:12:49.480]  poverty law center and of course co-intel pro disinfo
[2:12:49.480 --> 2:12:53.080]  operatives trying to get us to all in fight instead of focusing on defeating
[2:12:53.080 --> 2:12:56.280]  the new world order so we're going to open the phones up
[2:12:56.280 --> 2:13:00.360]  right now and take calls for most of the hour
[2:13:00.360 --> 2:13:03.720]  then i'm going to hit a few big stories towards the end and then more calls
[2:13:03.720 --> 2:13:07.640]  and more news as we go into the fourth and final hour today
[2:13:07.640 --> 2:13:11.720]  that was certainly a bone-shattering interview against the new world order
[2:13:11.720 --> 2:13:14.360]  with lord christopher montan i believe that was the most powerful
[2:13:14.360 --> 2:13:16.840]  of the five interviews that was the fifth interview we've done with lord
[2:13:16.840 --> 2:13:20.520]  montan uh extremely powerful and uh so you can
[2:13:20.520 --> 2:13:24.120]  certainly comment on that i hope you take the video off prison planet dot tv
[2:13:24.120 --> 2:13:26.680]  burn it to div x and give it to everyone you know
[2:13:26.680 --> 2:13:29.720]  because in that hour long interview probably 50 minutes of radio time
[2:13:29.720 --> 2:13:33.000]  because i skipped one break and went five minutes into the third hour
[2:13:33.000 --> 2:13:37.080]  it's about 50 minutes of air time just we covered the gamut there
[2:13:37.080 --> 2:13:41.080]  uh ladies and gentlemen right now let's go to your phone calls as promised
[2:13:41.080 --> 2:13:44.760]  erin in new ham shirt you're on the air worldwide sir
[2:13:44.760 --> 2:13:48.840]  alex uh i just want to start by saying thank you uh you're truly my hero you
[2:13:48.840 --> 2:13:52.360]  know i thought i was alone in this world seeing what was going on
[2:13:52.360 --> 2:13:55.400]  and now you show me that there's a lot of others out there fighting the fight
[2:13:55.400 --> 2:13:59.960]  and i thank you for that i just want to say that uh i think the time is now
[2:13:59.960 --> 2:14:03.240]  i've been telling a lot of people this for a lot of years oh for the longest
[2:14:03.240 --> 2:14:05.800]  time people just looked at me with the glass eyes
[2:14:05.800 --> 2:14:10.280]  uh glazed overlook like i'm crazy uh but in the past few months alex people
[2:14:10.280 --> 2:14:13.720]  are waking up fast uh so fast it scares me
[2:14:13.720 --> 2:14:17.400]  uh so i exactly and that's why i'm telling people
[2:14:17.400 --> 2:14:20.600]  a lot of great people for 10 20 30 40 years
[2:14:20.600 --> 2:14:23.320]  in fact i want to get red beckham back on the show he's been fighting him for
[2:14:23.320 --> 2:14:28.040]  50 you know it was so hard 10 years ago 20 years ago now
[2:14:28.040 --> 2:14:32.280]  world government's out in the open now is the time to expose these people
[2:14:32.280 --> 2:14:35.320]  well i just want to say that that one of the things that i did that i would like
[2:14:35.320 --> 2:14:39.080]  to encourage other people to do is to is to is to maintain contact with your
[2:14:39.080 --> 2:14:42.440]  local police you know i live in a small town and uh
[2:14:42.440 --> 2:14:45.960]  you know you think that these guys uh you know don't know but a lot of them do
[2:14:45.960 --> 2:14:49.560]  and some of them don't and they need to know i think they need to know who we
[2:14:49.560 --> 2:14:54.040]  are where we are either waking up because for 50 years
[2:14:54.040 --> 2:14:57.160]  and a lot of them of course are out of the force the 30 40 years but
[2:14:57.160 --> 2:15:00.520]  in the last few decades especially they get these monthly
[2:15:00.520 --> 2:15:04.520]  secret reports demonizing these crazy people say there's going to be a carbon
[2:15:04.520 --> 2:15:07.160]  tax these crazy people say there's a world government
[2:15:07.160 --> 2:15:10.600]  these crazy people say the banks are going to bankrupt us by design and want
[2:15:10.600 --> 2:15:13.880]  to shut down our industry and that's what the hell they read and the cops go
[2:15:13.880 --> 2:15:18.440]  but that's what's happening see the globalist own propaganda is blowing up
[2:15:18.440 --> 2:15:21.160]  in their face because they wanted to psychologically
[2:15:21.160 --> 2:15:25.240]  imprint people to where when world government finally got set up
[2:15:25.240 --> 2:15:28.680]  no one would resist it because they've been told it wasn't kosher to talk
[2:15:28.680 --> 2:15:32.280]  about but now it's okay to talk about it
[2:15:32.280 --> 2:15:36.760]  and because it's out in the open and when i tell people we're having victories
[2:15:36.760 --> 2:15:39.240]  folks we are but at the same time the new old
[2:15:39.240 --> 2:15:43.400]  orders in control of the government so they're just expanding their operation
[2:15:43.400 --> 2:15:46.760]  because they have nothing to lose they've committed so many crimes
[2:15:46.760 --> 2:15:50.520]  that they can't turn back now we're on a collision course and it's important for
[2:15:50.520 --> 2:15:54.920]  police and military to understand we're not your enemy we're the american people
[2:15:54.920 --> 2:15:58.680]  but you work for the new world order and you need to become aware of that and
[2:15:58.680 --> 2:16:02.680]  realize and start saying no to this together and we can save america go
[2:16:02.680 --> 2:16:05.240]  ahead yeah no you're you're you're right on
[2:16:05.240 --> 2:16:08.680]  alice's as always and uh you know like i say
[2:16:08.680 --> 2:16:11.720]  so you're talking to local cops and they're awake what are they saying make
[2:16:11.720 --> 2:16:15.160]  sure everybody in your town knows i've talked to my town officials my
[2:16:15.160 --> 2:16:19.160]  select men they all know so so that way i mean stop stop stop
[2:16:19.160 --> 2:16:21.480]  erin tell me what they say when you talk to them
[2:16:21.480 --> 2:16:25.240]  uh well you know a lot of them they say you know jeez we know you know i know
[2:16:25.240 --> 2:16:28.600]  that the the world's going you know going to hell in a handbasket and all that
[2:16:28.600 --> 2:16:32.120]  and you know and but but they're starting to see it i've got you know
[2:16:32.120 --> 2:16:34.840]  like i said there's a couple of my talk to the local detective
[2:16:34.840 --> 2:16:37.800]  other good good good people to talk to with the detectives because they've got
[2:16:37.800 --> 2:16:41.640]  the mind for that they're already you know their their minds are not stupid
[2:16:41.640 --> 2:16:44.520]  i've talked to a bunch of la pd detectives
[2:16:44.520 --> 2:16:47.400]  uh different events and things i've been at with hollywood people it's always
[2:16:47.400 --> 2:16:50.520]  retired detectives or part-time detectives that are guarding them and
[2:16:50.520 --> 2:16:54.120]  they say they're all awake and this was years ago
[2:16:54.120 --> 2:16:57.400]  for the first time alex i've really i really see i see hope
[2:16:57.400 --> 2:16:59.800]  and for a long time like i said i've seen this since i was a kid i've been
[2:16:59.800 --> 2:17:02.520]  trying to warn people since i was a kid i seen it it was just clear as day to me
[2:17:02.520 --> 2:17:06.040]  i don't even understand how other people can't it boggles my mind how people
[2:17:06.040 --> 2:17:08.840]  can't see what's happening to them let me tell you why erin and i appreciate
[2:17:08.840 --> 2:17:13.080]  your call they're cowards and even if it's admitted on television the world
[2:17:13.080 --> 2:17:16.680]  government's here they don't want to resist it or speak out against it
[2:17:16.680 --> 2:17:20.600]  because they don't respect themselves and that's what's sad about it
[2:17:20.600 --> 2:17:23.720]  they have no idea you're alive once we're being tested
[2:17:23.720 --> 2:17:28.040]  it's time to make the choice jeff in tennessee you're on the air
[2:17:28.040 --> 2:17:32.520]  thanks for taking my call uh just to give you a little bit of hindsight man
[2:17:32.520 --> 2:17:36.440]  uh nine months ago i was a dollar republican and then
[2:17:36.440 --> 2:17:39.320]  i was on the radio dial one day and i turned to you
[2:17:39.320 --> 2:17:44.600]  and i found a voice that was similar to what i was thinking man and
[2:17:44.600 --> 2:17:47.960]  i just want to let you know that ever since i've been woke up i've hit the
[2:17:47.960 --> 2:17:50.760]  ground running to try to spread the information
[2:17:50.760 --> 2:17:55.960]  um for my law enforcement i have contacted a ton of my old friends that
[2:17:55.960 --> 2:18:00.040]  are you know swat team guys detectives everything you know and i try to
[2:18:00.040 --> 2:18:04.440]  tell them what's going on and you know it's a little bit of a joke between me
[2:18:04.440 --> 2:18:07.800]  and them is that you know i love you man and i want you to
[2:18:07.800 --> 2:18:10.840]  wake up because i hate to have to fight you one day
[2:18:10.840 --> 2:18:14.040]  and i just want you to know that i'm out here
[2:18:14.040 --> 2:18:18.040]  and in the military and i'm trying to wake up as many people as i can
[2:18:18.040 --> 2:18:22.440]  and you really don't know where your reward is
[2:18:22.440 --> 2:18:26.760]  until you see the people start waking up and i woke up you know 20 30 people
[2:18:26.760 --> 2:18:29.880]  ever since you know i started listening to you and i knew that
[2:18:29.880 --> 2:18:34.760]  where i was thinking inside that i wasn't crazy you know the secret is
[2:18:34.760 --> 2:18:37.800]  jeff i didn't wake you up you are already awake
[2:18:37.800 --> 2:18:42.040]  and those 30 people you've woken up you didn't wake them up you simply pointed
[2:18:42.040 --> 2:18:45.400]  out what they already knew subconsciously
[2:18:45.400 --> 2:18:49.720]  absolutely and uh just to take it one step further um
[2:18:49.720 --> 2:18:53.800]  i'm in a suburb of the mephiss area and uh i'm actually going to run for city
[2:18:53.800 --> 2:18:58.360]  council and our suburb uh under an independent ticket
[2:18:58.360 --> 2:19:01.800]  under a constitutionalist and even if you don't win in the process of running
[2:19:01.800 --> 2:19:05.800]  you'll educate people absolutely man and i just want you to say
[2:19:05.800 --> 2:19:10.280]  to say to you uh keep up the good work man and uh foot soldiers like me we're
[2:19:10.280 --> 2:19:12.600]  out here we're getting the information out for you man
[2:19:12.600 --> 2:19:15.960]  well god bless you jeff i'm a foot soldier too i mean we're all in this
[2:19:15.960 --> 2:19:19.080]  together and and that's what's so frustrating
[2:19:19.080 --> 2:19:22.520]  about seeing people in government and corporations
[2:19:22.520 --> 2:19:26.600]  and just the general public saying oh it's not my job or i'm glad you're out
[2:19:26.600 --> 2:19:30.360]  there alex i'm just a regular guy like you jeff
[2:19:30.360 --> 2:19:33.560]  i mean i was in college and they were teaching me world government was good
[2:19:33.560 --> 2:19:38.120]  and my founding fathers were bad and that the second amendment was bad
[2:19:38.120 --> 2:19:41.720]  and i said this is a bunch of sedition who are these people and i went and
[2:19:41.720 --> 2:19:47.080]  found out the whole story and that was 18 19 20 years ago
[2:19:47.080 --> 2:19:52.840]  and i got on air 14 years ago 14 plus now a little bit over 14 years and the

[2:24:24.200 --> 2:24:27.960]  okay i'm sorry about that
[2:24:27.960 --> 2:24:31.480]  i found it kind of interesting when you're talking about the
[2:24:31.480 --> 2:24:36.600]  other the globalist and instant and how they pretty much try to try to
[2:24:36.600 --> 2:24:41.240]  desensitize us and dumb it down even i quickly but
[2:24:41.240 --> 2:24:45.240]  but you know incrementally yes okay well
[2:24:45.240 --> 2:24:49.160]  i prefer example i saw a movie a few months back
[2:24:49.160 --> 2:24:52.360]  it's called a a bureaucracy i don't know if you've heard of it
[2:24:52.360 --> 2:24:55.800]  heard about it yeah mike judge he's a great guy yeah yeah yeah i found it
[2:24:55.800 --> 2:24:59.160]  really hilarious you know when i first thought that's actually how it's going
[2:24:59.160 --> 2:25:02.840]  to be that's the globalist plan yeah except they won't keep they won't keep
[2:25:02.840 --> 2:25:05.720]  a bunch of morons around after everybody's dumbed down they're going
[2:25:05.720 --> 2:25:09.480]  to accelerate their soft kill operation but everybody's so poisoned and so
[2:25:09.480 --> 2:25:11.880]  dumbed down they can't even tell what's happening to them
[2:25:11.880 --> 2:25:15.880]  yeah i found it pretty uh pretty hilarious when i was watching and i
[2:25:15.880 --> 2:25:19.080]  started thinking about everything that you know that you try to tell everybody
[2:25:19.080 --> 2:25:22.600]  you know yeah mike judge is a fan of this show
[2:25:22.600 --> 2:25:26.840]  uh no that that was nice to hear you know and and you know maybe maybe the
[2:25:26.840 --> 2:25:30.520]  actual movies and maybe not that are great but just uh
[2:25:30.520 --> 2:25:35.160]  just a message that he's trying to you know yeah judges are good guys new
[2:25:35.160 --> 2:25:39.160]  movie uh extract i think is one of his best
[2:25:39.160 --> 2:25:42.440]  i just watched that on the treadmill last week jogging
[2:25:42.440 --> 2:25:46.360]  and uh yeah idiocracy that's exactly what we're talking about i appreciate your
[2:25:46.360 --> 2:25:50.840]  call good to hear from you tony good point marlin in texas marlin you're on
[2:25:50.840 --> 2:25:54.280]  the air go ahead yeah hi alex i listen to your show
[2:25:54.280 --> 2:25:57.800]  all the time i encourage people to listen to it if nothing
[2:25:57.800 --> 2:26:02.520]  if for nothing else for entertainment i really appreciate your perspectives
[2:26:02.520 --> 2:26:07.000]  my question is about one of your major points is usually
[2:26:07.000 --> 2:26:13.880]  the false left-right paradigm and i am a lot of trouble because having come from
[2:26:13.880 --> 2:26:18.600]  the southern baptist background as in the service like i i'm really clear
[2:26:18.600 --> 2:26:24.360]  who the right wing is and i'm very aware of their intolerance
[2:26:24.360 --> 2:26:29.000]  and about a number of issues so i know who they are listen to rex lembaugh for
[2:26:29.000 --> 2:26:32.440]  years and years and years because he articulates a lot of things that i
[2:26:32.440 --> 2:26:35.800]  sir i'm not saying there's not a difference between the left and right
[2:26:35.800 --> 2:26:38.760]  i'm saying at the end of the day they're controlled by the same interests not
[2:26:38.760 --> 2:26:43.000]  people on the left or the right the leaders of it contain the debate
[2:26:43.000 --> 2:26:47.000]  and you notice government gets bigger we lose more freedoms no matter who is in
[2:26:47.000 --> 2:26:50.120]  and you get seventy five eighty ninety percent of the people
[2:26:50.120 --> 2:26:53.560]  against open borders ninety nine percent against the banker bailout
[2:26:53.560 --> 2:26:59.400]  that was in gallup it still happens okay so my point is is that's all window
[2:26:59.400 --> 2:27:03.640]  dressing we need to start debating the shadow government the private banks
[2:27:03.640 --> 2:27:07.160]  that are illegitimately bought off both parties
[2:27:07.160 --> 2:27:10.920]  okay and and they dangle intolerance issues out there
[2:27:10.920 --> 2:27:14.760]  to get people on the left to vote for big government
[2:27:14.760 --> 2:27:19.240]  as if somebody suppressing them so what if somebody doesn't like your lifestyle
[2:27:19.240 --> 2:27:22.120]  there's freedom in this country it's a political
[2:27:22.120 --> 2:27:25.240]  football to be tossed back and forth all day
[2:27:25.240 --> 2:27:29.080]  and then the left comes in and wants to indoctrinate people's kids
[2:27:29.080 --> 2:27:31.960]  when that's up to the parents to decide how their kids are raised
[2:27:31.960 --> 2:27:36.840]  so the right wing legitimately tells the left don't teach my six-year-old how to
[2:27:36.840 --> 2:27:41.400]  fist or other things like that and they go oh you're intolerant do you know
[2:27:41.400 --> 2:27:44.920]  what they teach kids in public school
[2:27:44.920 --> 2:27:49.640]  i understand your perspective on that well look at
[2:27:49.640 --> 2:27:53.000]  i mean what is it you don't i mean you say for entertainment purposes i had a
[2:27:53.000 --> 2:27:57.320]  guy uh the day before christmas eve at a gas
[2:27:57.320 --> 2:28:01.000]  station come up and say do you really believe all the stuff you say
[2:28:01.000 --> 2:28:06.200]  and i said sir almost everything i talk about you can document i believe
[2:28:06.200 --> 2:28:10.440]  everything i'm saying sometimes i have a guest on sometimes we cover things
[2:28:10.440 --> 2:28:13.480]  that i don't believe in on the air to have a debate about it
[2:28:13.480 --> 2:28:16.680]  you know and it's good to get outside the box and just have a debate but
[2:28:16.680 --> 2:28:20.200]  everything i talk about everything i discuss
[2:28:20.200 --> 2:28:25.080]  i believe because i have the evidence sir look at everything i talk about ends
[2:28:25.080 --> 2:28:27.320]  up unfolding i told you they were going to put body
[2:28:27.320 --> 2:28:31.080]  scanners in all airports six years ago seven years ago as i saw governor
[2:28:31.080 --> 2:28:34.520]  ridge say they were going to do it i mean what it what is entertaining about
[2:28:34.520 --> 2:28:36.840]  this because let me tell you this isn't entertaining for me
[2:28:36.840 --> 2:28:40.440]  i wake up almost every night freaked out about what's going on
[2:28:40.440 --> 2:28:44.280]  i know how real this is i'm freaked out about having to say no to the body
[2:28:44.280 --> 2:28:46.760]  scanners now when i fly they're going in everywhere
[2:28:46.760 --> 2:28:50.280]  but i'm gutting up and getting ready to do that and things are getting more
[2:28:50.280 --> 2:28:54.200]  serious i mean what is it what is this is not entertaining sir
[2:28:54.200 --> 2:29:00.520]  i mean this is funny to you i'm not i'm not suggesting that it's funny for a
[2:29:00.520 --> 2:29:03.960]  moment i know that you're very very serious and i appreciate all the
[2:29:03.960 --> 2:29:09.400]  documentation that you do get to for people that don't understand
[2:29:09.400 --> 2:29:13.320]  i mean all you have to do is mention some small thing about
[2:29:13.320 --> 2:29:17.240]  the things that you believe in their eyes close it glades over and they stop
[2:29:17.240 --> 2:29:20.920]  listening that's right marlin they've been preconditioned
[2:29:20.920 --> 2:29:24.600]  that when they hear world government they start laughing
[2:29:24.600 --> 2:29:27.880]  i mean i mean i was on the radio this morning locally on the talk station
[2:29:27.880 --> 2:29:31.560]  talking about the body scanners and how they record it and how they keep your
[2:29:31.560 --> 2:29:34.760]  kids blood at birth and they played crazy train in the background
[2:29:34.760 --> 2:29:37.960]  they take your kids blood at birth illegally for a un database
[2:29:37.960 --> 2:29:41.480]  it's admitted they're putting in body scanners that record your naked body
[2:29:41.480 --> 2:29:44.760]  it didn't funny but people are subconsciously afraid of my
[2:29:44.760 --> 2:29:48.680]  information instead of standing up and saying no to it it's easier to play
[2:29:48.680 --> 2:29:52.600]  crazy train or helicopter noises in the background
[2:29:52.600 --> 2:29:56.440]  we're on the march the empires on the run
[2:29:56.440 --> 2:30:02.360]  alex jones and the gcn radio network

[2:33:20.760 --> 2:33:24.360]  year and won't say where the money went
[2:33:24.360 --> 2:33:27.960]  the government's paying to have factories shut down and coal plants
[2:33:27.960 --> 2:33:31.960]  and won't let new ones be built but china can put up dirty ones that our
[2:33:31.960 --> 2:33:36.200]  government pays for they're putting in body scanners

[2:33:55.400 --> 2:33:58.360]  into buying into whatever the mainstream media says
[2:33:58.360 --> 2:34:01.400]  and if the mainstream media says line your kids up and give them deadly
[2:34:01.400 --> 2:34:04.600]  inoculations that the drug zone inserted meds can
[2:34:04.600 --> 2:34:08.600]  brain damage them give them guion beret syndrome sterilize them reduce
[2:34:08.600 --> 2:34:12.200]  fertility give them cancer kill them

[2:34:15.160 --> 2:34:19.240]  but the good news is this big flu hype didn't go over well
[2:34:19.240 --> 2:34:22.840]  and there's record numbers of people not taking it
[2:34:22.840 --> 2:34:26.120]  the good news is the Copenhagen treaty that the un announced was world
[2:34:26.120 --> 2:34:28.920]  government blew up in their face all their fraud and
[2:34:28.920 --> 2:34:33.240]  corruptions coming out the good news is
[2:34:33.240 --> 2:34:37.400]  30 plus states are moving or have already declared 10th amendment sovereignty
[2:34:37.400 --> 2:34:40.760]  to the federal government the states and the congress are telling
[2:34:40.760 --> 2:34:44.360]  obama lawsuits are going to get filed by the states against his government
[2:34:44.360 --> 2:34:49.000]  takeover of health care even if he can ram it through
[2:34:49.000 --> 2:34:51.800]  the good news is the people are starting to figure out how the world really
[2:34:51.800 --> 2:34:53.960]  works and marlin i wasn't trying to be mean to you
[2:34:53.960 --> 2:34:57.160]  it's just when somebody says to me oh your show is entertaining because i get
[2:34:57.160 --> 2:35:00.040]  emails like that and people on the street go i don't agree with a lot of what
[2:35:00.040 --> 2:35:04.360]  you say but your show is sure entertaining
[2:35:04.360 --> 2:35:07.320]  that's like saying watching a car wreck and somebody flopping around with their
[2:35:07.320 --> 2:35:11.640]  arm chopped off is entertaining this is not entertaining sir
[2:35:11.640 --> 2:35:14.760]  it's not entertaining having the mainstream media demonize me
[2:35:14.760 --> 2:35:18.760]  and having people death threaten me it's not entertaining uh to know what
[2:35:18.760 --> 2:35:23.240]  we're up against and to force myself to stand up and go up against it
[2:35:23.240 --> 2:35:26.920]  if you had any idea just how serious this was you wouldn't even have that in
[2:35:26.920 --> 2:35:32.040]  your repertoire
[2:35:32.120 --> 2:35:36.280]  and you know what it's not my fault and it's not your fault marlin
[2:35:36.280 --> 2:35:39.480]  if you try to wake up people and they laugh at you
[2:35:39.480 --> 2:35:43.400]  that's their problem that's why their standard of living is dropping
[2:35:43.400 --> 2:35:50.280]  you know i saw this weekend imf statistics about how this country was
[2:35:50.280 --> 2:35:53.720]  what was it 34 percent of global gross domestic product
[2:35:53.720 --> 2:36:00.040]  and is now 22 percent of global domestic product global gdp
[2:36:00.040 --> 2:36:06.280]  or global domestic product the calculation of the u.s was 34 35 now
[2:36:06.280 --> 2:36:11.880]  it's 22 23 in fact i printed that article at home
[2:36:11.880 --> 2:36:14.440]  i want to say it was wall street journal this weekend and i don't have it in
[2:36:14.440 --> 2:36:18.120]  front of me guys google imf says us gross domestic
[2:36:18.120 --> 2:36:22.440]  product drops that should bring it up i believe from memory it's 22 percent
[2:36:22.440 --> 2:36:25.960]  from 34 or 35 but let's get the actual numbers
[2:36:25.960 --> 2:36:30.760]  you think that's funny i know you don't think it's funny marlin
[2:36:30.760 --> 2:36:34.360]  but we when people laugh at us that's because they're intimidated they're
[2:36:34.360 --> 2:36:36.680]  scared deep down they know something's wrong
[2:36:36.680 --> 2:36:39.960]  and they want to feel elitist they want to feel like they're establishment and
[2:36:39.960 --> 2:36:43.480]  so tv and the culture has told them laugh at somebody
[2:36:43.480 --> 2:36:47.160]  who talks about global government laugh at somebody that talks about global
[2:36:47.160 --> 2:36:51.400]  corruption you don't have a responsibility just laugh at it
[2:36:51.400 --> 2:36:57.880]  that's the doctrine of slaves that's the modus operandi of slaves
[2:36:59.640 --> 2:37:02.760]  now here's the deal

[2:39:46.760 --> 2:39:50.120]  efforts and your courage and there's a couple of things i'd like to touch on
[2:39:50.120 --> 2:39:55.000]  quickly one of them uh be a dive cab boy a grant
[2:39:55.000 --> 2:40:01.080]  69 70 anyway i have feel so grateful to hear you i stumbled
[2:40:01.080 --> 2:40:06.200]  serendipitously upon uh debar chelot died 11 rise of the police state that's
[2:40:06.200 --> 2:40:09.320]  how i found you thank the lord i found you
[2:40:09.320 --> 2:40:15.640]  and anyway it's also i feel gratified that what i knew back then the things
[2:40:15.640 --> 2:40:19.160]  weren't right behind the scenes and you're exposing it
[2:40:19.160 --> 2:40:23.400]  it's it's so great the other thing the last thing i would like to touch on
[2:40:23.400 --> 2:40:27.400]  i've heard all my life about carbon monoxide co
[2:40:27.400 --> 2:40:32.280]  big poison but our co2 is poison which we exhale at the plant
[2:40:32.280 --> 2:40:36.120]  inhale well how come nobody's ever talked about well
[2:40:36.120 --> 2:40:40.120]  we should quit making carbonated beverages because that's co2 and i don't
[2:40:40.120 --> 2:40:43.160]  know that well actually governments are moving to
[2:40:43.160 --> 2:40:47.320]  tax it because of that almost everything puts off co2 that's why
[2:40:47.320 --> 2:40:49.800]  they chose it they don't want to deal with real
[2:40:49.800 --> 2:40:53.320]  toxic waste or genetic engineering or things that can and are causing
[2:40:53.320 --> 2:40:55.720]  problems they want something that allows them to
[2:40:55.720 --> 2:40:59.480]  selectively control industry they're monopoly
[2:40:59.480 --> 2:41:02.680]  capitalist they're not free market they use government
[2:41:02.680 --> 2:41:08.840]  to shut down their competition joe okay well it's been nice chatting with you
[2:41:08.840 --> 2:41:12.600]  live i've listed to you uh ever since i don't know two or three
[2:41:12.600 --> 2:41:16.280]  years ago and i really do appreciate and enjoy your
[2:41:16.280 --> 2:41:20.120]  your program and it's very enlightening it's so hard to get people to get their
[2:41:20.120 --> 2:41:23.960]  heads out of the sand because they're scared i guess i fight it pure
[2:41:23.960 --> 2:41:28.360]  agreed or two the biggest they've been raised to be lazy
[2:41:28.360 --> 2:41:32.200]  and to not think of themselves as leaders they've been raised to just go
[2:41:32.200 --> 2:41:35.320]  through life and and and i mean intellectually
[2:41:35.320 --> 2:41:38.120]  lazy you know a lot of them are hard-working they have to understand
[2:41:38.120 --> 2:41:41.320]  that freedom isn't free people better do the research they better get involved
[2:41:41.320 --> 2:41:46.360]  joe good to hear from you jack in california you're on the air jack
[2:41:46.360 --> 2:41:52.360]  hey alex how's it going good sir um i wanted to talk to you
[2:41:52.360 --> 2:41:57.560]  about a few few things first off uh huge huge fans
[2:41:57.560 --> 2:42:01.000]  um i and like everyone else you know i've been noticing
[2:42:01.000 --> 2:42:04.120]  more and more and more and more people waking up all the time and it's
[2:42:04.120 --> 2:42:09.880]  it's great to see um and especially at in the San Francisco area
[2:42:09.880 --> 2:42:13.320]  around where i live you see billboards everywhere
[2:42:13.320 --> 2:42:17.720]  you know go get vaccinated only you can prevent h1n1 you know and i i'll talk
[2:42:17.720 --> 2:42:21.400]  to you now they've shifted gears to say you've got to take it or you'll
[2:42:21.400 --> 2:42:25.000]  infect others when if you supposedly had the shot
[2:42:25.000 --> 2:42:28.040]  you're protected from the idiots that don't want to take the mercury
[2:42:28.040 --> 2:42:33.960]  cancer virus shot so again it's all lies so now dr dina del and others who by
[2:42:33.960 --> 2:42:36.200]  the way i want to get back on to debate him
[2:42:36.200 --> 2:42:39.000]  just tell him i want to have him on to discuss the flu shot and other things
[2:42:39.000 --> 2:42:42.680]  we've had him on before i've heard him on air say arrest anyone that doesn't
[2:42:42.680 --> 2:42:46.440]  take it sue anyone that doesn't take it because you're going to infect others
[2:42:46.440 --> 2:42:51.560]  with a deadly weapon of h1n1 it's an asinine lie

[2:43:12.440 --> 2:43:16.040]  within minutes the scanners are the answer and this happens right as the
[2:43:16.040 --> 2:43:19.320]  scanners are going in they're saying oh we're putting these in because of this
[2:43:19.320 --> 2:43:23.000]  now they were ordered a year ago they were going in the last three months now

[2:46:03.160 --> 2:46:07.640]  but but when i that's why co until pros attacking us that's why they're hitting
[2:46:07.640 --> 2:46:11.960]  us from all sides because they know we have really had a big
[2:46:11.960 --> 2:46:15.720]  effect and and it actually creeps me out i never
[2:46:15.720 --> 2:46:19.800]  intended to be in this position i never intended for this to happen but you say
[2:46:19.800 --> 2:46:23.400]  you drive around with info wars dot com spray paint it on your car

[2:46:27.640 --> 2:46:31.320]  happening where people respond to you again that's a sonar
[2:46:31.320 --> 2:46:36.360]  ping of how many people are awake yeah exactly it's weird it's because at
[2:46:36.360 --> 2:46:39.560]  first i expected to get in fights over it maybe you know maybe people would be
[2:46:39.560 --> 2:46:43.560]  against all nine eleven things but it's almost every other day and i'm not
[2:46:43.560 --> 2:46:46.040]  exaggerating someone and they don't just
[2:46:46.040 --> 2:46:50.360]  hawk i mean people are leaning out their windows waving shaking their fists
[2:46:50.360 --> 2:46:53.240]  it's pretty impressive i mean you that you've got to see it
[2:46:53.240 --> 2:46:56.760]  and and it is and it's about that you know fighting
[2:46:56.760 --> 2:47:00.200]  through local government and i would imagine one one hundredth of people that
[2:47:00.200 --> 2:47:03.000]  see it and like it are the ones that are waving at you
[2:47:03.000 --> 2:47:06.600]  exactly you know so many people because i have a you know pretty cool loud
[2:47:06.600 --> 2:47:10.760]  sports car that i whip around and you know people are always kind of gawking
[2:47:10.760 --> 2:47:13.880]  at it so that's why i decided to put info words on it and uh...
[2:47:13.880 --> 2:47:17.320]  has it been helpful has it been helpful with the ladies
[2:47:17.320 --> 2:47:20.440]  uh... well i have a girlfriend i've been with her for eight years we're both
[2:47:20.440 --> 2:47:24.920]  you know when the info were together so she's uh... amazingly beautiful um so
[2:47:24.920 --> 2:47:27.880]  you know we're both in school to be nothing like a patriot nothing like a
[2:47:27.880 --> 2:47:31.560]  patriot woman that's a great actually well that's the thing i had to find a
[2:47:31.560 --> 2:47:34.360]  girlfriend who could understand these issues because otherwise
[2:47:34.360 --> 2:47:37.400]  she gets sick of me fighting for these issues you know
[2:47:37.400 --> 2:47:41.080]  so i'm in school to be an educator so i can inform you know students i want to
[2:47:41.080 --> 2:47:44.200]  be a high school science teacher and uh... you've kind of
[2:47:44.200 --> 2:47:48.200]  you know after thinking about what i want to do in my life i realize that's one
[2:47:48.200 --> 2:47:51.640]  of the best ways to inform you will influence thousands of people with the
[2:47:51.640 --> 2:47:55.320]  truth instead of the brainwashing matthew send us a photo send it
[2:47:55.320 --> 2:47:59.240]  to show tips and info words dot com your car and we'll try to post it
[2:47:59.240 --> 2:48:02.360]  are you got it good to hear from you matthew you're awesome
[2:48:02.360 --> 2:48:06.280]  very exciting steve in pennsylvania you're on the air go ahead
[2:48:06.280 --> 2:48:08.920]  hi ox is good to hear your voice hey buddy
[2:48:08.920 --> 2:48:13.000]  hi i was calling to uh... get in on that conversation about the uh... awakening
[2:48:13.000 --> 2:48:16.360]  in the dual nature of man i wanted to share a couple of my beliefs and thoughts
[2:48:16.360 --> 2:48:18.120]  and get your feedback on it sure
[2:48:18.120 --> 2:48:21.960]  that um... man's basically a spiritual being that's tied to a physical
[2:48:21.960 --> 2:48:25.720]  existence and that at the same time we're individuals
[2:48:25.720 --> 2:48:29.800]  and we are one being we're like drops in the ocean or leaves on a tree or
[2:48:29.800 --> 2:48:32.440]  well we're definitely tied in to other people
[2:48:32.440 --> 2:48:36.280]  yeah like blood brains in the brain celling and that we're at the stage now
[2:48:36.280 --> 2:48:38.840]  that we have enough people we're at a critical mass
[2:48:38.840 --> 2:48:40.120]  we're kind of like that
[2:48:40.120 --> 2:48:43.160]  space baby in 2001 space odyssey
[2:48:43.160 --> 2:48:47.080]  and that that depopulation scheme would serve to like jack needle into the
[2:48:47.080 --> 2:48:50.280]  back of our head suck our brains out and try to abort us before uh...
[2:48:50.280 --> 2:48:53.560]  we actually get to wake up now that's exactly the new world order wants to
[2:48:53.560 --> 2:48:56.600]  abort us they've they've made the calculations
[2:48:56.600 --> 2:49:00.440]  all they can do set a grid up and kill us they know we're going to resist
[2:49:00.440 --> 2:49:03.560]  they know we're going to win and so they're setting up the police state
[2:49:03.560 --> 2:49:05.320]  grid to kill people
[2:49:05.320 --> 2:49:08.600]  yes so what i'd like to suggest is that we have a
[2:49:08.600 --> 2:49:12.440]  coordinated prayer attack now with the prayer being
[2:49:12.440 --> 2:49:16.200]  oh just simple oh god guide me and for people
[2:49:16.200 --> 2:49:20.840]  all over the planet to say this prayer at noon and at midnight
[2:49:20.840 --> 2:49:24.040]  at dawn and at dusk and at your hardcore every hour
[2:49:24.040 --> 2:49:28.520]  and it would help to kickstart well i'm always loved i always love that christian
[2:49:28.520 --> 2:49:31.160]  prayer and i appreciate your call that lead guide and direct me
[2:49:31.160 --> 2:49:33.560]  make me a vessel to help people and to be good
[2:49:33.560 --> 2:49:36.920]  help me to be virtuous help me to be strong help me not to hurt others help
[2:49:36.920 --> 2:49:41.880]  me to know the truth uh... and it's that simple
[2:49:41.880 --> 2:49:45.720]  and even if you don't believe in god if you every day or
[2:49:45.720 --> 2:49:49.080]  sit down for five minutes and meditate by meditate i don't mean like a yogi i mean
[2:49:49.080 --> 2:49:52.440]  think about the world think about what's really important slow down a little
[2:49:52.440 --> 2:49:55.480]  bit get in that quiet place
[2:49:55.480 --> 2:49:58.600]  because anytime i get death threats or get persecuted or get lied about
[2:49:58.600 --> 2:50:02.200]  sometimes i get bummed out a little and i always just sit down and think about it
[2:50:02.200 --> 2:50:04.840]  and say god and god says look think about all these
[2:50:04.840 --> 2:50:07.800]  innocents you're saving think about humanity think about all the courage it
[2:50:07.800 --> 2:50:11.800]  took before you to bring all of us to this point
[2:50:11.800 --> 2:50:15.400]  this is part of your mission and then i'm not worried about whatever happens to
[2:50:15.400 --> 2:50:19.080]  me whatever happens no matter how horrible it is or how much they demonize
[2:50:19.080 --> 2:50:23.400]  me or what they make up about me i know in the end i'm good i know in the end i
[2:50:23.400 --> 2:50:25.880]  tried i know in the end of the best job i could
[2:50:25.880 --> 2:50:29.960]  it was rags before god but it was that my heart was right
[2:50:29.960 --> 2:50:33.640]  and that i repented and i wanted to be a good person
[2:50:33.640 --> 2:50:37.880]  and i wanted to have courage and stand up and then you get to the point almost
[2:50:37.880 --> 2:50:42.840]  where i have really no fear and i almost wish i had the fear
[2:50:42.840 --> 2:50:45.880]  because then it made me a little more frosty and concerned i've kind of just
[2:50:45.880 --> 2:50:48.840]  gotten where explosions are going off around me and i'm not even paying
[2:50:48.840 --> 2:50:53.160]  attention to them but i still have the fear for innocence
[2:50:53.160 --> 2:50:56.920]  and i have the anger that innocence are being abused and so that's the real fuel
[2:50:56.920 --> 2:50:59.720]  that drives my reactor we're going to come back
[2:50:59.720 --> 2:51:09.080]  take a bunch more calls on the other side of this quick break

[2:54:47.080 --> 2:54:50.040]  find me that article from the wall street journal about
[2:54:50.040 --> 2:54:56.840]  the u.s being 34 35 percent of GDP 10 years ago global GDP
[2:54:56.840 --> 2:55:00.920]  global gross product i guess would be the term
[2:55:00.920 --> 2:55:04.280]  and how it's now down to 22 they didn't find that they found another one from
[2:55:04.280 --> 2:55:09.320]  december 22nd 2009 wall street journal economist react gdp
[2:55:09.320 --> 2:55:13.720]  revision surprisingly large and it just shows the big drop
[2:55:13.720 --> 2:55:21.000]  in 2008 2009 but i'm looking for the global
[2:55:21.000 --> 2:55:24.120]  gross product
[2:55:25.240 --> 2:55:30.600]  but we'll see if we can find that try uh this is the search try this

[3:03:45.320 --> 3:03:50.760]  and uh it's regarding our second amendment and i wanted to ask you
[3:03:50.760 --> 3:03:55.000]  uh if as far as what you know the law does
[3:03:55.000 --> 3:04:03.080]  not state law overrule district law yes uh but a lot of uh county
[3:04:03.080 --> 3:04:07.240]  if you mean that by district and city laws against the second amendment in
[3:04:07.240 --> 3:04:10.760]  different states particularly texas and a few others
[3:04:10.760 --> 3:04:14.760]  do get overturned but a lot of them don't get challenged
[3:04:14.760 --> 3:04:19.320]  and so there are a lot of cities and counties that have set up anti second
[3:04:19.320 --> 3:04:23.080]  amendment laws against gun shows or gun shops or other things
[3:04:23.080 --> 3:04:26.440]  that are a violation of state law because the state hasn't said they could do
[3:04:26.440 --> 3:04:29.400]  that the people's representatives the legislature
[3:04:29.400 --> 3:04:33.160]  haven't authorized it but just because something's unconstitutional doesn't
[3:04:33.160 --> 3:04:38.040]  mean they won't throw you in prison for it uh why what's going on

[3:09:26.120 --> 3:09:29.000]  it was one a couple years ago in tennessee somebody
[3:09:29.000 --> 3:09:34.120]  outside it was a city judge outside of his jurisdiction put up a sign saying
[3:09:34.120 --> 3:09:37.880]  our courts are a joke because of a divorce proceeding he had
[3:09:37.880 --> 3:09:40.920]  didn't even say the judge's name but if you would have it would have been okay
[3:09:40.920 --> 3:09:43.960]  they had him arrested now the judge got in trouble later but it shows their
[3:09:43.960 --> 3:09:47.640]  delusional you're telling me because a family
[3:09:47.640 --> 3:09:52.440]  was reportedly poaching that the judge said in the in the neighborhood in the
[3:09:52.440 --> 3:09:56.120]  town in the county where he said a global when they say global that means
[3:09:56.120 --> 3:09:59.080]  everywhere in his jurisdiction when a judge says global that means their
[3:09:59.080 --> 3:10:04.280]  jurisdiction you're telling me that that he said no firearms
[3:10:04.280 --> 3:10:09.080]  discharged where uh... within this subdivision that i live at
[3:10:09.080 --> 3:10:13.240]  and it was a female judge but hold on you're in that but hold on
[3:10:13.240 --> 3:10:17.800]  is there a county law are you in the county and is there a county law
[3:10:17.800 --> 3:10:21.880]  against discharging firearms no sir
[3:10:21.880 --> 3:10:26.120]  well sir you should you should contact the newspapers that is uh...
[3:10:26.120 --> 3:10:31.080]  so so so let me get this straight somebody said a family was hunting deer
[3:10:31.080 --> 3:10:33.720]  for food or i mean you said tell me the whole story
[3:10:33.720 --> 3:10:38.040]  uh... yes or what they did uh... they found some deer uh... they had found uh...
[3:10:38.040 --> 3:10:41.960]  one deer an axis deer and a white tailed deer
[3:10:41.960 --> 3:10:45.560]  and what the white tailed deer was uh... close to our property
[3:10:45.560 --> 3:10:49.240]  uh... there's like fifty foot leeway and it had an arrow in it
[3:10:49.240 --> 3:10:53.240]  and uh... so because somebody is shooting a uh...
[3:10:53.240 --> 3:10:58.280]  foreign uh... exotic deer which the game wardens have no jurisdiction over
[3:10:58.280 --> 3:11:01.240]  uh... and because a white tail was shot
[3:11:01.240 --> 3:11:05.400]  what does that have to do with any of you i mean again that's what they do now
[3:11:05.400 --> 3:11:08.760]  oh a guy tried to blow up the plane with underwear we're going to record all
[3:11:08.760 --> 3:11:10.920]  your naked bodies of body scanners now
[3:11:10.920 --> 3:11:16.520]  oh yeah i mean the again uh... so so so some dear god
[3:11:16.520 --> 3:11:20.280]  i i just alec i told uh... the members on this board
[3:11:20.280 --> 3:11:23.880]  uh... well if i said well doesn't state law castle law
[3:11:23.880 --> 3:11:27.320]  overruled district law as far as discharging a farm
[3:11:27.320 --> 3:11:31.240]  if there's a rabbit animal or a snake i have a right to shoot if my wife is
[3:11:31.240 --> 3:11:35.400]  going out to hang clothes and they said well yeah yeah that's
[3:11:35.400 --> 3:11:40.040]  that's that's true but uh... you know and i said but now that state law castle
[3:11:40.040 --> 3:11:43.960]  law says i have a right to protect my property and or my person
[3:11:43.960 --> 3:11:48.120]  and then they want to argue it may but uh... for the judge in the county said
[3:11:48.120 --> 3:11:52.360]  that it was global that no discharging of firearms is now
[3:11:52.360 --> 3:11:56.120]  implemented by the board out here and by the district judge
[3:11:56.120 --> 3:11:59.240]  and the game warden said i said well what am i supposed to do and he goes
[3:11:59.240 --> 3:12:02.520]  well the game warden answered and replied well that you're going to catch
[3:12:02.520 --> 3:12:05.640]  twenty two so i got a call a game warden that covers
[3:12:05.640 --> 3:12:08.600]  two counties here in texas to come kill a rattlesnake
[3:12:08.600 --> 3:12:12.680]  now i don't know let me stop you and i appreciate your call you've got a big
[3:12:12.680 --> 3:12:16.120]  problem and you should write it up post on the web somewhere
[3:12:16.120 --> 3:12:23.160]  look take uh... freestone county where
[3:12:23.160 --> 3:12:27.240]  my dad's got some family property going back to mexican land grants
[3:12:27.240 --> 3:12:31.160]  it's one thing to say you can't shoot a little rack
[3:12:31.160 --> 3:12:36.360]  or you can't shoot a big giant rack they will arrest you take your car take your
[3:12:36.360 --> 3:12:39.320]  rifles in freestone county they're doing this in many other counties
[3:12:39.320 --> 3:12:43.080]  there's plenty of deer the deer everywhere giant deer little deer
[3:12:43.080 --> 3:12:47.480]  you know everything that they've got the what they call i guess the
[3:12:47.480 --> 3:12:51.400]  the abnormal ones that have the giant racks
[3:12:51.400 --> 3:12:55.400]  and they're saying you can't shoot something if it doesn't have a certain
[3:12:55.400 --> 3:13:00.200]  spread which nobody can measure or if it's a four point you can't shoot it but
[3:13:00.200 --> 3:13:04.120]  if it's a three point you can and there's just no one for
[3:13:04.120 --> 3:13:07.560]  no way for people to know most that deer hunting out there
[3:13:07.560 --> 3:13:11.560]  is is done in brush that's you know where the good deer are they're smart and
[3:13:11.560 --> 3:13:14.280]  don't come out during deer season except at night
[3:13:14.280 --> 3:13:18.120]  so you got a hunt in brush and a lot of times you can see some big antlers
[3:13:18.120 --> 3:13:21.480]  and uh... you know take your shot and then they're not even you know they're
[3:13:21.480 --> 3:13:24.760]  trying to restrict doe permits for people to see
[3:13:24.760 --> 3:13:28.120]  the power to tax is the power to destroy a permit
[3:13:28.120 --> 3:13:31.640]  is an authorization to do something that's illegal
[3:13:31.640 --> 3:13:34.760]  so they turn your right into a privilege it's like sixty something years ago i
[3:13:34.760 --> 3:13:38.360]  forget the exact date was in the forties new york city said
[3:13:38.360 --> 3:13:42.120]  you still got your second amendment you got to pay this was it five dollar
[3:13:42.120 --> 3:13:46.680]  licensing fee it's a formality people accepted that
[3:13:46.680 --> 3:13:52.040]  a decade later or so they said okay uh... now you got to pay a big fee
[3:13:52.040 --> 3:13:55.720]  it's bigger and we're going to restrict who gets it until now
[3:13:55.720 --> 3:13:58.760]  only a few hundred people have got firearms permits and they're basically
[3:13:58.760 --> 3:14:03.160]  all mafia or corrupt Goldman Sachs employees that was even in the
[3:14:03.160 --> 3:14:07.720]  Bloomberg a few weeks ago they're all getting gun permits
[3:14:07.720 --> 3:14:11.160]  so that's how they turn a right into a privilege that's why i'm against
[3:14:11.160 --> 3:14:15.720]  concealed carry permits you have a gun permit in texas and
[3:14:15.720 --> 3:14:19.400]  nevada and arizona and vermont under the second amendment
[3:14:19.400 --> 3:14:25.000]  the state hasn't abridged it but because under common law concealed weapons
[3:14:25.000 --> 3:14:29.320]  are illegal it's bearing arm keep it and bear arms
[3:14:29.320 --> 3:14:33.560]  good guys have them out in the open so they're creating a custom and the
[3:14:33.560 --> 3:14:36.040]  general idea that you got to have a permit to own a gun
[3:14:36.040 --> 3:14:40.120]  and all these hollywood shows and cop shows based in new york other places
[3:14:40.120 --> 3:14:44.920]  always show them busting people in fiction and nonfiction
[3:14:44.920 --> 3:14:50.520]  shows in new york or chicago and so you get a repair person at your house they
[3:14:50.520 --> 3:14:53.320]  see a gun case they go out and call the cops
[3:14:53.320 --> 3:14:57.080]  because they move here from new york or wherever they think your guns are
[3:14:57.080 --> 3:15:00.360]  illegal i've had this happen to me
[3:15:00.360 --> 3:15:04.360]  okay because people are so dumbed down
[3:15:04.360 --> 3:15:09.000]  they have so so the perception that guns are illegal is now out there
[3:15:09.000 --> 3:15:12.440]  how many billboards have you seen in the last decade i'm more than a decade
[3:15:12.440 --> 3:15:16.680]  i've seen the same variant federally funded the ad council with your tax
[3:15:16.680 --> 3:15:19.720]  money billboards all over the country i've been in
[3:15:19.720 --> 3:15:22.840]  galveston texas i've been in dallas texas i've been in
[3:15:22.840 --> 3:15:28.200]  los angeles california i've been in chicago i've been in florida i have
[3:15:28.200 --> 3:15:33.800]  been all over the country not even looking for these and i see them
[3:15:33.800 --> 3:15:40.280]  and it shows a billboard and it says report illegal guns
[3:15:40.280 --> 3:15:46.360]  and it's a picture or a graphic of a handgun pointed at you aggressively
[3:15:46.360 --> 3:15:50.200]  it'll have the front cylinder with the bullet senate and the barrel aimed at
[3:15:50.200 --> 3:15:53.560]  you threateningly it's all psychological or it'll have the gun turned
[3:15:53.560 --> 3:15:56.920]  sideways with a guy with a mask on the images criminals
[3:15:56.920 --> 3:15:59.960]  have guns i've seen several different variants you've seen on the web
[3:15:59.960 --> 3:16:03.720]  i've posted photos i took myself in galveston
[3:16:03.720 --> 3:16:07.000]  and in tiny fine print you got to get right up under the billboard
[3:16:07.000 --> 3:16:10.280]  i got 2020 vision you got a squint to read it
[3:16:10.280 --> 3:16:16.440]  it says with an asterisk when a gun is involved in illegal activity or in a
[3:16:16.440 --> 3:16:23.400]  crime but the big message is report illegal guns
[3:16:23.400 --> 3:16:30.760]  it's all about perception i have distant family and people
[3:16:30.760 --> 3:16:37.560]  that have been at my house and who have seen a nerf gun
[3:16:37.560 --> 3:16:40.200]  i mean it's great we run around the backyard the front yard neighborhood
[3:16:40.200 --> 3:16:43.560]  kids have them we have big nerf battles in fact i plan to
[3:16:43.560 --> 3:16:47.320]  try to go home earlier today um my son's nerf gun
[3:16:47.320 --> 3:16:51.000]  broke you know planned obsolescence they break usually in a few months
[3:16:51.000 --> 3:16:56.840]  so i'm gonna go buy him and my daughter because hers i'm sure will break soon
[3:16:56.840 --> 3:17:02.360]  a new nerf gun and some new nerf bullets we're gonna go have a nerf battle
[3:17:02.360 --> 3:17:08.520]  now so-called liberal parents think that a gun in the hands of the citizens
[3:17:08.520 --> 3:17:15.000]  even a toy gun is a devilish evil weapon they're scared to death of it
[3:17:15.000 --> 3:17:17.880]  i've told the story one time of a well-known newspaper writer now a
[3:17:17.880 --> 3:17:22.040]  magazine writer at my parents house i was in college
[3:17:22.040 --> 3:17:26.680]  and the big gun case i didn't keep my guns at home then i went home to get a
[3:17:26.680 --> 3:17:30.600]  deer rifle i pull up say hi to him i go in my
[3:17:30.600 --> 3:17:34.760]  parents bedroom do the combination get a deer rifle out
[3:17:34.760 --> 3:17:37.560]  there in the kitchen he sees me walking by the door with a gun
[3:17:37.560 --> 3:17:42.840]  and i hear like a shriek and he says was is that a gun he starts getting up he's
[3:17:42.840 --> 3:17:47.160]  all scared white faced and i walk in and i say don't worry it's 243
[3:17:47.160 --> 3:17:50.200]  for small deer in texas it's unloaded i opened it up
[3:17:50.200 --> 3:17:53.960]  lever action savage first-year rifle my dad got
[3:17:53.960 --> 3:17:57.880]  back in the 50s i said look this is and he was you get out of here please get
[3:17:57.880 --> 3:18:01.480]  out of here and he's not like i put you think it was a cowardly person
[3:18:01.480 --> 3:18:05.960]  he has imperial conditioning to be scared to death of a slave with a gun now he
[3:18:05.960 --> 3:18:11.000]  sees cops swat teams dogs helicopters troops he feels good
[3:18:11.000 --> 3:18:15.480]  he sees a slave with a gun he gets scared and he said please just get out of
[3:18:15.480 --> 3:18:20.600]  here please please and i and i left but i've seen people
[3:18:20.600 --> 3:18:24.680]  i've seen family where my kids are going bang bang playing outside at a family
[3:18:24.680 --> 3:18:27.400]  event and they get scared to death of that and act
[3:18:27.400 --> 3:18:32.760]  like some great offense has been committed that is imperial conditioning
[3:18:32.760 --> 3:18:37.400]  we are turning into a domesticated jellyfish
[3:18:37.400 --> 3:18:43.000]  population that is being gelded now the kids can't play dodgeball then they
[3:18:43.000 --> 3:18:46.120]  can't play tag then they can't wrestle then they can't
[3:18:46.120 --> 3:18:50.840]  run most school districts abandoned now they can't even walk fast now some say
[3:18:50.840 --> 3:18:55.560]  they can't talk they can't hug they can't shake hands
[3:18:55.560 --> 3:19:00.280]  they are the equivalent of supermax prisoners
[3:19:00.280 --> 3:19:04.520]  now on the airplanes you can't talk the last hour you have to look straightforward
[3:19:04.520 --> 3:19:08.040]  you can't cover your your knees with a blanket
[3:19:08.040 --> 3:19:11.400]  you may be a terrorist you can have no electronic device
[3:19:11.400 --> 3:19:14.440]  all because of some guy with a firecracker in his underwear
[3:19:14.440 --> 3:19:17.960]  this is the domestication scientifically to train us
[3:19:17.960 --> 3:19:23.240]  to be defenseless and to be gelded and to be weak
[3:19:23.240 --> 3:19:29.960]  so go out and take physical jujitsu or taekwondo or
[3:19:29.960 --> 3:19:33.400]  whatever it is you like go take a boxing class
[3:19:33.400 --> 3:19:38.360]  go buy firearms take some safety courses get proficient with it
[3:19:38.360 --> 3:19:42.040]  store your firearms pop properly but we need a culture of liberty
[3:19:42.040 --> 3:19:45.560]  it's like this times of london story and i've got similar articles out of the
[3:19:45.560 --> 3:19:48.520]  us children reaching age three without being able
[3:19:48.520 --> 3:19:52.120]  to say a word survey finds now the government's going to get involved
[3:19:52.120 --> 3:19:56.360]  because of tv and the culture and the parents never being home
[3:19:56.360 --> 3:20:00.680]  the children can't even talk they're dumbing us down into mindless idiots

[3:25:56.120 --> 3:25:59.560]  hey alex i have a comment to me concerning a
[3:25:59.560 --> 3:26:04.840]  statement that your last guest had made that's lord montan
[3:26:04.840 --> 3:26:09.480]  right he was encouraging everybody to call the representatives
[3:26:09.480 --> 3:26:12.920]  and to let them know hey if we have to have world governance
[3:26:12.920 --> 3:26:17.480]  uh you know this let's have it you know elect them
[3:26:17.480 --> 3:26:21.880]  and i know it's pretty obvious for i think most americans and definitely
[3:26:21.880 --> 3:26:26.440]  your listeners the united states you know with our local
[3:26:26.440 --> 3:26:31.160]  state and federal politicians we're having hard enough time trying to get
[3:26:31.160 --> 3:26:35.160]  honest uh people elected as it is yeah john i think you're
[3:26:35.160 --> 3:26:38.840]  missing the point he said we're obviously against its tyrannical
[3:26:38.840 --> 3:26:42.280]  the issue is they couldn't get the countries to sign on
[3:26:42.280 --> 3:26:46.200]  even though that was a fraud now they're just doing it it's open tyranny
[3:26:46.200 --> 3:26:52.760]  that way you educate people uh along what's really happening
[3:26:52.760 --> 3:26:55.320]  you understand i mean we're pointing out that we're going into global
[3:26:55.320 --> 3:26:58.280]  government uh governance and government without even
[3:26:58.280 --> 3:27:02.680]  being able to vote on it no i understand that's fine
[3:27:02.680 --> 3:27:06.360]  then it just you know i think any form of
[3:27:06.360 --> 3:27:09.800]  global governance you know people should fight against it worldwide yes yes
[3:27:09.800 --> 3:27:12.920]  national sovereignty is a firewall against tyranny and not no one wants
[3:27:12.920 --> 3:27:16.840]  global government neither does lord montan it was a debate tool
[3:27:16.840 --> 3:27:20.040]  and i agree with him to say look we're gonna have this this you know
[3:27:20.040 --> 3:27:23.240]  we should be able to vote on it we should decide if we want to be part of it
[3:27:23.240 --> 3:27:26.520]  but i hear you and i appreciate your call john mordecai
[3:27:26.520 --> 3:27:30.360]  in israel got calls from all over the place and then mark in switzerland
[3:27:30.360 --> 3:27:33.880]  uh mordecai are on the air yes hello alex
[3:27:33.880 --> 3:27:40.520]  hey buddy hey um i would like to let you know that uh thanks to you i uh i
[3:27:40.520 --> 3:27:44.600]  watched jessie ventura's documentary dealing with uh with the september 11
[3:27:44.600 --> 3:27:48.040]  attacks conspiracy theory and i would like to
[3:27:48.040 --> 3:27:53.000]  call your attention to a detail that the research team may have overlooked
[3:27:53.000 --> 3:27:56.840]  uh something that jumped out at me when i watched the documentary namely that's
[3:27:56.840 --> 3:28:00.920]  the ownership of hangar 17 where the only known
[3:28:00.920 --> 3:28:06.600]  evidence from 9 11 still in existence is locked away from public scrutiny
[3:28:06.600 --> 3:28:11.560]  yes juliani signed a mayoral decree that no one can ever get it and that he
[3:28:11.560 --> 3:28:16.440]  after being out of office controls it how does a mayor give himself power and
[3:28:16.440 --> 3:28:20.760]  control and basic ownership over something after he leaves
[3:28:20.760 --> 3:28:25.000]  now the very interesting well the thing that jumped out at me was this
[3:28:25.000 --> 3:28:28.760]  when when jessie's camera team has viewed
[3:28:28.760 --> 3:28:34.920]  the building from a certain angle hangar 17 in jfk airport has a prominent
[3:28:34.920 --> 3:28:40.840]  unfaded billboard that says tower air now anyone can go and look in youtube and
[3:28:40.840 --> 3:28:45.320]  they can see it there tower airlines was an israeli airline that would bankrupt
[3:28:45.320 --> 3:28:49.400]  in 2000 and it's none other than that building
[3:28:49.400 --> 3:28:54.040]  hangar 17 that house tower airs then brand new corporate headquarters
[3:28:54.040 --> 3:28:56.840]  i did not know that somebody should write up an article
[3:28:56.840 --> 3:29:00.440]  about that and we posted info wars dot com
[3:29:00.440 --> 3:29:04.280]  this is uh the my question is this why
[3:29:04.280 --> 3:29:08.440]  the nine eleven evidentiary material that would provide clues
[3:29:08.440 --> 3:29:11.800]  which is the absence of presence of super thermite or other explosive
[3:29:11.800 --> 3:29:16.520]  materials in the dust from the blast sit there for safekeeping in the former
[3:29:16.520 --> 3:29:21.640]  executive headquarters of a ten-year defunct israeli front organization
[3:29:21.640 --> 3:29:25.080]  that contracted heavily for the u.s defense department
[3:29:25.080 --> 3:29:29.400]  and it still has an unfaded sign hanging on the building
[3:29:29.400 --> 3:29:34.120]  uh sir write it up write it up and we'll post it you know get the video clip or
[3:29:34.120 --> 3:29:37.720]  links to it or screenshots and we'll link to it or somebody i don't have
[3:29:37.720 --> 3:29:40.440]  that many writers but if somebody will put it together

[3:32:21.000 --> 3:32:24.600]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country
[3:32:24.600 --> 3:32:29.080]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation

[3:32:58.040 --> 3:33:03.320]  or call 1-877-327-0365
[3:33:09.320 --> 3:33:14.840]  well i'm not the kind to kiss and tell but i've been seen with farah
[3:33:14.840 --> 3:33:18.920]  i've never been with okay quickly mordecai and israel finish up your
[3:33:18.920 --> 3:33:22.280]  point i'm gonna a few more calls and get into some financial news
[3:33:22.280 --> 3:33:26.920]  i i asked you anything else to add go ahead yes just very very quickly i've
[3:33:26.920 --> 3:33:30.520]  been hesitating to say this on your show for a long time
[3:33:30.520 --> 3:33:34.040]  uh... because i do the same kind of work that you do here in israel for more
[3:33:34.040 --> 3:33:37.720]  than twelve years i've been doing this when i heard a guy call earlier and say
[3:33:37.720 --> 3:33:42.280]  the years your show was entertaining uh... despite the fact that they have
[3:33:42.280 --> 3:33:45.800]  they've destroyed my family and it's a whole different thing that you have no
[3:33:45.800 --> 3:33:49.320]  time for on the show right now but i had to call and say this when i heard
[3:33:49.320 --> 3:33:52.520]  somebody say that that that you know that they treat your show as
[3:33:52.520 --> 3:33:55.400]  entertainment when it's so dead serious
[3:33:55.400 --> 3:33:59.880]  and everybody in the world is suffering from from what they're doing
[3:33:59.880 --> 3:34:03.960]  uh... the the closer that somebody approaches the truth
[3:34:03.960 --> 3:34:07.560]  the more danger there is for the person to be called
[3:34:07.560 --> 3:34:12.520]  a a provocateur because there are certain things that that if i were to say
[3:34:12.520 --> 3:34:16.040]  here in israel about israel i would be promptly arrested
[3:34:16.040 --> 3:34:19.480]  and if you would say it in america about america
[3:34:19.480 --> 3:34:22.680]  you would also get a visit you know and i you said you've gotten best threats and
[3:34:22.680 --> 3:34:24.520]  things like that
[3:34:24.520 --> 3:34:29.000]  but eventually uh... and and this is a question really rather than a comment
[3:34:29.000 --> 3:34:30.920]  or statement because
[3:34:30.920 --> 3:34:33.640]  i know you know uh...
[3:34:33.640 --> 3:34:37.800]  people talk about the people talk about their arms being taken away
[3:34:37.800 --> 3:34:41.240]  and the danger of their taking away our guns
[3:34:41.240 --> 3:34:44.520]  at one point somebody's going to have to address the issue
[3:34:44.520 --> 3:34:50.200]  of who who gets to give the orders to fire and when
[3:34:50.200 --> 3:34:54.040]  and under what circumstances and
[3:34:54.040 --> 3:34:57.880]  and when is that when is that going to happen who who are going to be the
[3:34:57.880 --> 3:34:58.920]  people
[3:34:58.920 --> 3:35:02.440]  because it's not it's not enough and it's not sufficient just to own the
[3:35:02.440 --> 3:35:03.320]  guns
[3:35:03.320 --> 3:35:06.120]  and just waving the guns and just owning them
[3:35:06.120 --> 3:35:09.000]  at one point someone's going to have to use them and somebody's going to have
[3:35:09.000 --> 3:35:10.920]  to determine
[3:35:10.920 --> 3:35:13.800]  who are the commanders who are the people who are you
[3:35:13.800 --> 3:35:16.720]  the i mean i get you get my point right
[3:35:16.720 --> 3:35:20.280]  more to kind of your point i appreciate your call
[3:35:20.280 --> 3:35:23.640]  answering that question thousands of pieces of data
[3:35:23.640 --> 3:35:27.000]  common sense history come into play
[3:35:27.000 --> 3:35:30.360]  the military and the police are starting to wake up
[3:35:30.360 --> 3:35:33.720]  the governments of the world and everything they can to brainwash them
[3:35:33.720 --> 3:35:37.400]  and turn them against the people and the people against the police and military
[3:35:37.400 --> 3:35:41.640]  the last thing we need is offensive attacks
[3:35:41.640 --> 3:35:46.600]  on the criminal government they have to stage events against themselves
[3:35:46.600 --> 3:35:49.400]  as a pretext to build up a police state
[3:35:49.400 --> 3:35:52.760]  knowing that people will be forced to resist them so they can then call that
[3:35:52.760 --> 3:35:56.520]  terrorism
[3:35:56.520 --> 3:35:59.560]  and it is really up to listeners
[3:35:59.560 --> 3:36:03.880]  to decide are they gonna let their kids be taken away to jail for no reason
[3:36:03.880 --> 3:36:07.960]  are if there's a mass plague released a bio weapon released
[3:36:07.960 --> 3:36:11.320]  obama saying you know get the u.s ready for bio attack
[3:36:11.320 --> 3:36:14.120]  they could use that as a pretext to bring in control
[3:36:14.120 --> 3:36:18.920]  financial collapse all of this for me it's defensive because you're not going
[3:36:18.920 --> 3:36:23.240]  to take the government back when it's illegitimate built into two redoubts
[3:36:23.240 --> 3:36:27.560]  and underground bases and facilities by going around and having war with a
[3:36:27.560 --> 3:36:30.680]  bunch of their minions
[3:36:30.680 --> 3:36:34.840]  you need to reach out now and educate people in the system how they've been
[3:36:34.840 --> 3:36:38.200]  controlled and show them the bigger picture
[3:36:38.200 --> 3:36:42.360]  and i don't just say that because i'm afraid of getting arrested
[3:36:42.360 --> 3:36:49.320]  as you alluded to if i got up on air and did call for violent confrontation
[3:36:49.320 --> 3:36:52.280]  what are the targets
[3:36:53.000 --> 3:36:56.520]  i mean if the police started running around arresting citizens with no
[3:36:56.520 --> 3:36:59.720]  evidence which they're starting to do slowly but in mass and taking them to a
[3:36:59.720 --> 3:37:01.480]  FEMA center
[3:37:01.480 --> 3:37:04.200]  i mean i i mean i'm already getting here to the point of saying i'm gonna have
[3:37:04.200 --> 3:37:08.200]  to go into airports when they try to body scan me and say no
[3:37:08.200 --> 3:37:11.240]  and and lord knows what they'll charge me with then but it's getting to the point
[3:37:11.240 --> 3:37:17.560]  where you have to say no and and and then what do you do
[3:37:17.560 --> 3:37:20.920]  i genuinely
[3:37:20.920 --> 3:37:27.720]  know that we have to identify the criminal element first
[3:37:27.720 --> 3:37:31.240]  to slow them down so we can stop their agenda politically
[3:37:31.240 --> 3:37:35.160]  and see by them forcing much of their agenda even when we politically beat
[3:37:35.160 --> 3:37:37.800]  it or no matter who gets into political office
[3:37:37.800 --> 3:37:41.800]  the system just goes forward that's waking people up now
[3:37:41.800 --> 3:37:46.680]  the globalist want insurrection they don't care if your average
[3:37:46.680 --> 3:37:49.480]  police officer gets killed or somebody in the military
[3:37:49.480 --> 3:37:52.440]  they want that they want to get us fighting with each other
[3:37:52.440 --> 3:37:56.280]  so i am not for a violent confrontation with the government
[3:37:56.280 --> 3:38:01.000]  that said i'm not going to be drug away to some FEMA center for my political
[3:38:01.000 --> 3:38:05.160]  speech and nobody's putting their hands on my children
[3:38:05.160 --> 3:38:09.640]  and the system has been running into people defensively defending
[3:38:09.640 --> 3:38:12.760]  themselves and the systems starting to get the message
[3:38:12.760 --> 3:38:16.120]  and backing off on many fronts
[3:38:16.120 --> 3:38:20.760]  uh and that's a sad thing that people in the system are
[3:38:20.760 --> 3:38:24.040]  i mean a lot of cps workers are getting killed now
[3:38:24.040 --> 3:38:27.320]  you notice they don't hype that up in the media it's just a little blurb
[3:38:27.320 --> 3:38:31.160]  but every few days i see where cps get get filled full of holes
[3:38:31.160 --> 3:38:35.640]  by people that don't want to give their children over to them
[3:38:35.640 --> 3:38:40.760]  but that is making them in many respects start following the constitution
[3:38:40.760 --> 3:38:47.640]  due process bill of rights um the system though then uses that to
[3:38:47.640 --> 3:38:53.720]  further militarize police so it's a very heavy heavy issue you raise
[3:38:53.720 --> 3:38:57.400]  and i've thought about trying to do a several hour special on it and i've
[3:38:57.400 --> 3:39:01.160]  done the research but to recompile the research because i get a piece here
[3:39:01.160 --> 3:39:04.760]  a piece there of my research and i try to lay out i guess you're
[3:39:04.760 --> 3:39:09.720]  saying the rules of engagement and the pentagon itself says 90 percent of
[3:39:09.720 --> 3:39:14.440]  war is psychological we have the truth they have the lies
[3:39:14.440 --> 3:39:21.240]  and so we better work for peace and work for waking the system up
[3:39:21.240 --> 3:39:24.360]  and work for getting our counties and states and cities back
[3:39:24.360 --> 3:39:28.760]  as we're doing here in the united states and exhaust all of those avenues
[3:39:28.760 --> 3:39:31.720]  and then when they come to take your farm or ranch because you can't pay the
[3:39:31.720 --> 3:39:35.640]  giant taxes they've levied that's up to you to make your personal decision
[3:39:35.640 --> 3:39:40.360]  i'll tell you and i'm sad for the police and military and bureaucrats because
[3:39:40.360 --> 3:39:43.400]  most of them are just dumbed down fools that think they have the authority of
[3:39:43.400 --> 3:39:48.440]  god a lot of people have made the decision
[3:39:48.440 --> 3:39:51.560]  mainly it's a lot of old korean war vets most the world war two vets have
[3:39:51.560 --> 3:39:55.560]  died off but i've seen this as a trend as a profile
[3:39:55.560 --> 3:39:59.160]  of the police harass them they stop them they harass them
[3:39:59.160 --> 3:40:02.680]  and a lot of this happened a few years ago in austin this whole world war two
[3:40:02.680 --> 3:40:06.440]  vets told the state police guy that was involved harassing him and trying to
[3:40:06.440 --> 3:40:09.880]  take his property it came out in the news he told him he said listen buddy you
[3:40:09.880 --> 3:40:14.040]  pulled me over for no reason one more time and there's going to be trouble
[3:40:14.040 --> 3:40:17.000]  and he killed him
[3:40:18.120 --> 3:40:21.880]  and that's what the the servants of the tyrants
[3:40:21.880 --> 3:40:25.640]  need to get their head screwed on and really understand
[3:40:25.640 --> 3:40:28.920]  they're pushing people that can't be pushed anymore
[3:40:28.920 --> 3:40:32.920]  they're pushing people that have just made the decision okay i'm dead
[3:40:32.920 --> 3:40:36.680]  i don't care next person in government treads on me
[3:40:36.680 --> 3:40:41.880]  i'm going to get violent that's what people are saying
[3:40:42.360 --> 3:40:45.880]  and now conservatives and libertarians have seen the government documents that
[3:40:45.880 --> 3:40:50.120]  we were given that we released where they are listed as the real terrorist and
[3:40:50.120 --> 3:40:53.480]  the real enemy well that lets you know this government is the real terrorist
[3:40:53.480 --> 3:40:56.280]  and is illegitimate
[3:40:56.280 --> 3:41:02.600]  but whoever fires first loses that's been said many times and i'm
[3:41:02.600 --> 3:41:07.000]  i'm old enough that's what the military wants people 18 to 25
[3:41:07.000 --> 3:41:10.520]  because they're young they think they're bulletproof they think manliness is
[3:41:10.520 --> 3:41:14.120]  just going out and having a war and having a firefight
[3:41:14.920 --> 3:41:19.400]  but even when i was younger i had read enough history and studied it to know
[3:41:19.400 --> 3:41:23.720]  that no we don't fight on their terms we don't go out and just get in a war with
[3:41:23.720 --> 3:41:28.040]  the establishment for no reason or do it in a way that will empower their
[3:41:28.040 --> 3:41:31.320]  police state and legitimize this control grid they've
[3:41:31.320 --> 3:41:34.440]  laboriously built
[3:41:35.480 --> 3:41:39.000]  it's a very very important question and maybe we should do a whole show
[3:41:39.000 --> 3:41:42.440]  sometimes maybe this week do a couple hours just opening the
[3:41:42.440 --> 3:41:46.600]  phones up about what's your line on the sand
[3:41:46.600 --> 3:41:48.920]  but
[3:41:48.920 --> 3:41:53.160]  the bureaucrats need to know that the system didn't build in fema camps and
[3:41:53.160 --> 3:41:57.160]  setting up checkpoints and putting in tracking grids for no reason
[3:41:57.160 --> 3:42:00.680]  they know that they were going to carry out a criminal banking heist i told you
[3:42:00.680 --> 3:42:04.840]  this 10 years ago and we're only entering this that would be so big
[3:42:04.840 --> 3:42:09.880]  people would start resisting that's why they take select cops from all over
[3:42:09.880 --> 3:42:13.960]  the country and fly them to different g20 events and other globalist events
[3:42:13.960 --> 3:42:17.560]  and have them attack old ladies with police dogs and sound cannon
[3:42:17.560 --> 3:42:22.680]  populations and they send sound cannons to menace tea parties in san
[3:42:22.680 --> 3:42:26.440]  diego because they're gearing up and getting their
[3:42:26.440 --> 3:42:30.680]  people ready and trained to engage the population
[3:42:30.680 --> 3:42:35.160]  i think if we have a real war a real guerrilla war
[3:42:35.160 --> 3:42:40.040]  and have 150 million gun owners only one percent decide to go out and only
[3:42:40.040 --> 3:42:43.480]  engage people one time
[3:42:43.480 --> 3:42:47.960]  that's a million 500 000 dead cops
[3:42:47.960 --> 3:42:52.840]  that's half the cops in the country dead in one day
[3:42:58.600 --> 3:43:02.040]  and we have a lot more than one percent that are ready to go
[3:43:02.040 --> 3:43:07.560]  and the the system knows that but thank god people have shown great restraint
[3:43:07.560 --> 3:43:12.280]  because the globalist in public documents public statements we had
[3:43:12.280 --> 3:43:16.520]  colonel roberts on a few weeks ago about this are training to bring in i4 and
[3:43:16.520 --> 3:43:20.600]  multinational troops and they've trained for it under n le09
[3:43:20.600 --> 3:43:25.880]  and other fema drills last year that they want that to happen
[3:43:25.880 --> 3:43:29.080]  i have said many times it's better that
[3:43:29.080 --> 3:43:34.360]  a hundred guilty men go free than one innocent man be executed or in prison
[3:43:34.360 --> 3:43:37.400]  and it turns out over a third of people on death row are innocent
[3:43:37.400 --> 3:43:40.520]  the d the dna proves it where people later confess
[3:43:40.520 --> 3:43:46.360]  and the dna proves it as well so i can't sit here and pass judgment
[3:43:46.360 --> 3:43:50.200]  on police and military a lot of which are waking up and are good people
[3:43:50.200 --> 3:43:54.280]  and just say that's the enemy prepare for war with them
[3:43:54.280 --> 3:43:59.160]  prepare for the guerrilla policy of total resistance
[3:43:59.160 --> 3:44:02.680]  but if they've got armies locking down cities marching out
[3:44:02.680 --> 3:44:07.560]  arresting people in mass i mean i had
[3:44:07.560 --> 3:44:11.560]  dr paul craig robertson last week former head of the treasury former wall
[3:44:11.560 --> 3:44:14.840]  street journal editor listing names of u.s citizens arrested under the
[3:44:14.840 --> 3:44:18.920]  patreon act held without trial for many years
[3:44:18.920 --> 3:44:21.400]  tortured
[3:44:22.120 --> 3:44:27.160]  this is admitted i mean we have slid so far
[3:44:27.480 --> 3:44:31.640]  and the system is creating a hobson's choice
[3:44:31.640 --> 3:44:35.560]  but as for me i see us making giant headway
[3:44:35.560 --> 3:44:40.360]  peaceably and the system desperately wants to make it violent
[3:44:40.360 --> 3:44:44.280]  the system wants to get a fight started with the american people
[3:44:44.280 --> 3:44:48.760]  against each other brother against brother father against son
[3:44:48.760 --> 3:44:53.480]  i know the average police officer didn't become a police officer because they
[3:44:53.480 --> 3:44:57.320]  wanted to be a bully i know they promote the bullies though
[3:44:57.320 --> 3:45:00.840]  i know most departments have become very corrupt the rank and file aren't but
[3:45:00.840 --> 3:45:04.280]  mid-level and high-level it's narcotics trafficking prostitution every major
[3:45:04.280 --> 3:45:07.080]  city they're always getting caught they're getting caught though because the
[3:45:07.080 --> 3:45:10.920]  system isn't totally corrupt it's a problem of all of our
[3:45:10.920 --> 3:45:13.320]  conscience it's a problem of all of our morals
[3:45:13.320 --> 3:45:16.760]  that has let us get to this point
[3:45:19.320 --> 3:45:22.280]  and so i just can't sit here and pass judgment
[3:45:22.280 --> 3:45:26.840]  and you know and and say oh anybody in a uniform is bad
[3:45:26.840 --> 3:45:36.120]  even if that uniform has been taken over by evil
[3:45:36.120 --> 3:45:38.840]  and this country still has a lot of freedom it still has a lot of good
[3:45:38.840 --> 3:45:42.280]  people in government there's a reason i'm still on the air there's a reason i
[3:45:42.280 --> 3:45:45.800]  haven't been killed there's a reason god's protecting me
[3:45:45.800 --> 3:45:48.360]  but also there are a lot of good people in the system and they're
[3:45:48.360 --> 3:45:51.560]  they're finally waking up like the population they're just like everybody
[3:45:51.560 --> 3:45:55.240]  else so the globalists are in a race to start a shooting war
[3:45:55.240 --> 3:45:59.640]  you know we don't have a big staff and that's why i try to raise money here
[3:45:59.640 --> 3:46:03.480]  i probably need to have four or five employees that just sit there on the
[3:46:03.480 --> 3:46:09.400]  message board in the comments banning people and and restricting people
[3:46:09.400 --> 3:46:12.680]  because there are people in there trying to stir up a shooting war people
[3:46:12.680 --> 3:46:16.600]  trying to provocateur trying to set people up
[3:46:16.600 --> 3:46:19.800]  and when we have done spot checks of their ip addresses
[3:46:19.800 --> 3:46:24.280]  it'll be the same 15 20 people they come on on shifts
[3:46:24.280 --> 3:46:27.640]  ip's for eight hours and another ip for eight hours
[3:46:27.640 --> 3:46:34.840]  they're running several shifts a day and their ip's go back to proxy server
[3:46:34.840 --> 3:46:38.200]  blocks and then we've got other tricks we can do
[3:46:38.200 --> 3:46:41.000]  where we can tell that's going back to government corporate servers
[3:46:41.000 --> 3:46:45.160]  the government is on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com
[3:46:45.160 --> 3:46:50.200]  trying to get people to talk about killing and saying alex is a wimp alex
[3:46:50.200 --> 3:46:54.920]  isn't tough alex isn't out calling for war
[3:46:54.920 --> 3:46:58.040]  their feds now i told you how turner was a fed
[3:46:58.040 --> 3:47:01.080]  they've now released the court transcript of the u.s attorney and fbi
[3:47:01.080 --> 3:47:07.640]  admitting he was above above the regular fbi in
[3:47:07.640 --> 3:47:11.720]  national security now he threatened and said go
[3:47:11.720 --> 3:47:15.240]  after a bunch of federal judges the states indicted him showing the power
[3:47:15.240 --> 3:47:18.440]  of the states and the states complied and put him
[3:47:18.440 --> 3:47:22.600]  in irons but it's come out and this came out last week
[3:47:22.600 --> 3:47:25.800]  it came out a few months ago in court he said he was as lawyers did
[3:47:25.800 --> 3:47:29.000]  it's now in the transcript on info wars dot com
[3:47:29.000 --> 3:47:33.560]  from the federal courthouse most of its redacted under national security
[3:47:33.560 --> 3:47:36.120]  a national security letter went out to that judge
[3:47:36.120 --> 3:47:43.480]  this guy is ultra operative well of course they want to make it racial
[3:47:43.480 --> 3:47:45.960]  so that other people hear about the new world order
[3:47:45.960 --> 3:47:50.760]  anti-new order movement and then
[3:47:51.560 --> 3:47:54.520]  think well i'm not getting involved with that it's all about killing judges
[3:47:54.520 --> 3:47:56.920]  and jews
[3:47:57.640 --> 3:48:01.480]  we have caught white supremacist leaders over and over and over again in the
[3:48:01.480 --> 3:48:05.080]  u.s canada england and germany in mainstream news
[3:48:05.080 --> 3:48:10.680]  not just infiltrating but founding and running the white supremacist groups
[3:48:10.680 --> 3:48:16.840]  all the major white supremacist websites are run by the feds
[3:48:16.840 --> 3:48:20.520]  we've identified what they're doing i mean we don't just get up here and say
[3:48:20.520 --> 3:48:24.680]  this stuff if you're not a fed folks you can't
[3:48:24.680 --> 3:48:30.680]  get up on the air and say go out and kill federal judges
[3:48:30.680 --> 3:48:35.080]  he did that for over a decade the feds are in court arguing for him
[3:48:35.080 --> 3:48:40.840]  at national security level of the fbi saying he is an agent
[3:48:40.840 --> 3:48:44.840]  and they're trying to get him off right now quietly this is a big embarrassment
[3:48:44.840 --> 3:48:49.800]  every few months i see articles they had a big one last year out of
[3:48:49.800 --> 3:48:53.560]  the uh orlando sentinel where the founder of the big white supremacist group and
[3:48:53.560 --> 3:48:57.000]  the guy leading its fbi informant it's all run by them
[3:48:57.000 --> 3:49:01.720]  and notice the biggest group attacking me telling all these lies making things up
[3:49:01.720 --> 3:49:06.360]  about me manufacturing completely fake made up garbage
[3:49:06.360 --> 3:49:10.120]  saying i work for israel or i work for the pope or i work for this or that
[3:49:10.120 --> 3:49:13.960]  i don't work for any of those people but alex jones and the constitution

[3:49:56.200 --> 3:50:04.120]  and the headline was head prison guard let me give you the exact headline
[3:50:04.120 --> 3:50:09.240]  prison guard charged under patriot act or gagged under patriot act and he came
[3:50:09.240 --> 3:50:12.680]  out with his letters where he was ordered to torture
[3:50:12.680 --> 3:50:15.960]  and they charged him with the patriot act to shut him up listen to all you
[3:50:15.960 --> 3:50:20.440]  nazi handlers out there they'll blow up a building and say you did it later it
[3:50:20.440 --> 3:50:24.120]  doesn't matter if you're an fbi agent like turner or an informant

[3:53:19.320 --> 3:53:22.840]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming
[3:53:22.840 --> 3:53:26.520]  number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[3:53:26.520 --> 3:53:29.480]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation
[3:53:29.480 --> 3:53:33.320]  is only compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a
[3:53:33.320 --> 3:53:36.520]  threat to local grids every year thousands of families lose
[3:53:36.520 --> 3:53:40.440]  their power from weather related onages number five a solar power generator

[3:54:40.440 --> 3:54:44.200]  you i attended a dinner in geneva a couple of months ago
[3:54:44.200 --> 3:54:48.200]  and at this event was someone who worked for a very large
[3:54:48.200 --> 3:54:54.600]  swiss bank and he made the claim that the uh... put options
[3:54:54.600 --> 3:54:59.160]  on the airlines uh... in september 2001
[3:54:59.160 --> 3:55:02.600]  were actually executed in switzerland and that

[3:55:25.800 --> 3:55:30.200]  in the week before and that it led back to alex brown doge
[3:55:30.200 --> 3:55:34.360]  uh... who and buzzy krongaard who later became executive director of the cia
[3:55:34.360 --> 3:55:37.800]  i'd love to hear more on that we're out of time mark thank you and i'm sorry to

[3:55:52.120 --> 3:55:55.000]  did last year going to this year in closing
[3:55:55.000 --> 3:55:58.600]  i wanted to thank ted anderson for all of his support of the network and his
[3:55:58.600 --> 3:56:03.320]  company might as resources and ted holds up over twenty dollars today
[3:56:03.320 --> 3:56:06.680]  and you have some great deals you're able to buy when gold dipped for a few
[3:56:06.680 --> 3:56:09.720]  weeks you're able to pass those onto people
[3:56:09.720 --> 3:56:13.880]  uh... but the real economy is imploding uh... the banks are looting us people
[3:56:13.880 --> 3:56:17.000]  need to get into silver and gold it's up over four hundred percent
[3:56:17.000 --> 3:56:20.920]  in the last seven eight years as you know and uh... i believe it's just going to
[3:56:20.920 --> 3:56:24.200]  continue to grow but regardless it can't be devalued overnight
[3:56:24.200 --> 3:56:27.960]  like paper money ted anderson tell us about the specials you have
[3:56:27.960 --> 3:56:31.720]  here at the close of the first weekday broadcast of two thousand and ten
[3:56:31.720 --> 3:56:35.640]  well i know time is tight and yeah indeed i was buying secretly i guess
[3:56:35.640 --> 3:56:39.240]  quietly while the prices were down here the last couple weeks
[3:56:39.240 --> 3:56:42.440]  uh... just because economics haven't changed we're gonna have more trouble in
[3:56:42.440 --> 3:56:43.400]  the future
[3:56:43.400 --> 3:56:47.240]  i highly suspect that we'll see thirteen hundred dollar gold before
[3:56:47.240 --> 3:56:51.720]  spring has passed so uh... i would really recommend that people get in we do
[3:56:51.720 --> 3:56:55.160]  have some really good buys in the british sovereigns right now the dollars
[3:56:55.160 --> 3:56:57.280]  dropping again i should add that go ahead
[3:56:57.280 --> 3:57:01.560]  yeah dollars dropping i mean we have ten dollar liberties ten dollar uh...
[3:57:01.560 --> 3:57:05.160]  indians we also have the british sovereign the frank which were bought
[3:57:05.160 --> 3:57:09.320]  when the market was lower and they're currently right now two sixty three twenty
[3:57:09.320 --> 3:57:14.360]  two uh... i do have the montana silver twenty dollars ninety nine cents
[3:57:14.360 --> 3:57:16.760]  it's kind of like taking advantage of it right now
[3:57:16.760 --> 3:57:19.560]  we're at it that eleven hundred and twenty dollar level
[3:57:19.560 --> 3:57:23.880]  eleven twenty four for a high today and we had we were looking at a thousand eighty
[3:57:23.880 --> 3:57:27.960]  here just about a week ago so that gives you an idea of what kind of prices
[3:57:27.960 --> 3:57:31.240]  what what the prices are doing and where i expect them to go
[3:57:31.240 --> 3:57:35.160]  i look to see about a thirty dollar increase from where i'm at right now so
[3:57:35.160 --> 3:57:39.160]  the discount you're you're you're putting out you bought gold and silver at
[3:57:39.160 --> 3:57:42.840]  what and now it's gone way up and you're again passing that savings on
[3:57:42.840 --> 3:57:45.000]  so tell us the top of saving people are getting
[3:57:45.000 --> 3:57:48.600]  well that eleven eighty eleven ninety is where we've seen the low
[3:57:48.600 --> 3:57:51.880]  and that's when i was buying so right now we're sitting in a position we even
[3:57:51.880 --> 3:57:55.960]  have u.s. eagles that are sitting at a what i would consider a below market
[3:57:55.960 --> 3:57:59.080]  price just due to the fact that the prices were lower
[3:57:59.080 --> 3:58:02.840]  we've seen gold go up about thirty bucks
[3:58:02.840 --> 3:58:06.120]  forty dollars actually absolutely and people should take advantage of this
[3:58:06.120 --> 3:58:08.520]  and tell them it's the alex jones to anderson special
[3:58:08.520 --> 3:58:11.560]  but to get these lower prices ladies and gentlemen the globalist
[3:58:11.560 --> 3:58:15.000]  have been trying with both feet to stop the price of gold down
[3:58:15.000 --> 3:58:17.960]  we believe they're going to be unsuccessful we believe that people
[3:58:17.960 --> 3:58:21.400]  need to get involved in gold and silver today a true store of wealth a hedge
