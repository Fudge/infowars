[00:00.000 --> 00:09.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:09.000 --> 00:21.360]  Oh my gosh, look at the headline that we see in the BBC.
[00:21.360 --> 00:27.200]  The one in Telegraph has a similar headline.
[00:27.200 --> 00:33.200]  Most are going to be forced to go to anti-extremist classes.
[00:33.200 --> 00:38.840]  And then you read the article, or articles, the government talking point, it's so mean,
[00:38.840 --> 00:39.840]  it's so horrible.
[00:39.840 --> 00:45.640]  They're jihad fighters for ISIS and al-Qaeda that left the UK in the last five years to
[00:45.640 --> 00:49.640]  battle the evil dictator Assad.
[00:49.640 --> 00:52.440]  And now they're coming back to England, and of course they're not going to be locked up
[00:52.440 --> 00:57.320]  for their terrorist activities because they're a proxy army of the West.
[00:57.320 --> 00:59.360]  But then how do you hide that?
[00:59.360 --> 01:02.520]  You put it out as a civil rights article.
[01:02.520 --> 01:07.320]  Can you believe what they're going to make ISIS and al-Qaeda fighters do after returning
[01:07.320 --> 01:13.200]  from blowing up churches, chopping men, women and children's heads off, forcing Shiite Muslims
[01:13.200 --> 01:18.160]  to suicide, bomb for them, or they'll kill their whole families, beheading priests, raping
[01:18.160 --> 01:24.720]  nuns, selling five- and six-year-old girls for the thousands into sex slavery?
[01:24.720 --> 01:29.880]  They're going to make Jeffrey Dahmer, who was found with a bunch of dead bodies in his refrigerator,
[01:29.880 --> 01:35.480]  go to a class.
[01:35.480 --> 01:42.400]  That is one article of literally over a hundred insane asylum stories, just to show how crazy
[01:42.400 --> 01:45.040]  all this is.
[01:45.040 --> 01:49.840]  I have a very special video that I came up here and I shot yesterday afternoon, and it
[01:49.840 --> 01:51.160]  went out late last night.
[01:51.160 --> 01:54.320]  And I'm going to be shooting these videos every couple of days.
[01:54.320 --> 02:01.800]  We're going to put them together, investigative reports, special reports, many documentaries.
[02:01.800 --> 02:07.480]  I am going whole hog on exposing how they're rigging the whole system against the American
[02:07.480 --> 02:12.480]  people, the American voter and Donald Trump, and really reaching out to the Bernie Sanders
[02:12.480 --> 02:14.520]  voters.
[02:14.520 --> 02:15.960]  One of them I talked to is voting for Hillary.
[02:15.960 --> 02:19.960]  I can't find real Hillary supporters anywhere in the country, even in Democrat cities, and
[02:19.960 --> 02:23.800]  no one else really can, except for very rich elite areas.
[02:23.800 --> 02:28.080]  And so I'm going to be illustrating this the next three months up to this election.
[02:28.080 --> 02:33.120]  And I'm going to be pointing out as well that just as Trump made it a big deal that the
[02:33.120 --> 02:39.440]  Republicans were stealing states from him that he won and just giving the delegates
[02:39.440 --> 02:42.920]  to Ted Cruz, you'd hear.
[02:42.920 --> 02:48.040]  Trump won Louisiana, and then a week later, but the delegates have been given to Ted Cruz.
[02:48.040 --> 02:51.200]  Or we're not going to let you vote in Colorado because the polls show Trump's going to have
[02:51.200 --> 02:52.200]  a landslide.
[02:52.200 --> 02:55.320]  We're just canceling the election and the party says it's Ted Cruz.
[02:55.320 --> 02:59.920]  Well, Trump didn't go along with that.
[02:59.920 --> 03:03.440]  And the media said, oh, you miscalculated, sore loser, and he said, I'm not a loser.
[03:03.440 --> 03:04.440]  You're stealing it.
[03:04.440 --> 03:06.200]  You're stealing the voters' votes.
[03:06.200 --> 03:09.600]  The Republican establishment had to back off.
[03:09.600 --> 03:12.200]  The Democrats didn't.
[03:12.200 --> 03:17.280]  You got a lot of their mental patient mainline Republicans who aren't real conservatives
[03:17.280 --> 03:22.200]  but are cuckold conservatives who just love being part of this old snot-nosed blue blood
[03:22.200 --> 03:29.000]  Rockefeller Republican country club group who are the snot-nosed racist, just liberal
[03:29.000 --> 03:31.800]  version of a Republican.
[03:31.800 --> 03:36.160]  The never Trump people still run around messianically with their cowboy hats.
[03:36.160 --> 03:38.000]  And I talked to a bunch of them.
[03:38.000 --> 03:39.000]  I said, you got any cattle?
[03:39.000 --> 03:44.560]  You're not going to use a lariat, you ever dehorned with an electric dehorner?
[03:44.560 --> 03:48.760]  You ever processed 2,000 head of cattle in one day?
[03:48.760 --> 03:55.360]  Because I have, and I don't consider myself to be a cowboy.
[03:55.360 --> 03:56.360]  They're still cowboys, by the way.
[03:56.360 --> 04:00.360]  They work about 12, 14 hours a day, and they are amazing.
[04:00.360 --> 04:01.360]  And they have a dangerous job.
[04:01.360 --> 04:02.360]  And I don't know what it is about.
[04:02.360 --> 04:03.360]  We're in a cowboy hat.
[04:03.360 --> 04:06.360]  We're going, oh, we're for Hillary, not a Trump.
[04:06.360 --> 04:08.960]  We're a cowboy hat, so it's all right.
[04:08.960 --> 04:15.400]  If I see one more cowboy hat in association, whether I'm going to throw up, but I digress.
[04:15.400 --> 04:17.840]  We've proven we've got our finger on the pulse of the globalist.
[04:17.840 --> 04:19.320]  We know how to defeat them.
[04:19.320 --> 04:21.520]  And I'm lobbying directly to Trump here on air.
[04:21.520 --> 04:23.760]  People say, why don't you just tell him, well, I have.
[04:23.760 --> 04:29.680]  But the point is, to some of his crew who are smart folks, they're just trying to decide
[04:29.680 --> 04:34.800]  how to go at this, and he's trying to decide, basically, does he launch it now or launch
[04:34.800 --> 04:35.800]  it later?
[04:35.800 --> 04:39.200]  And the whole theme is crooked, Hillary, from the emails to Google, not even listing
[04:39.200 --> 04:42.040]  Trump in election searches to fake polls.
[04:42.040 --> 04:43.480]  Like, I didn't see it in my stack.
[04:43.480 --> 04:49.880]  You guys pull me the articles on M4s.com with Reuters now at mixed, they skew to pull.
[04:49.880 --> 04:53.080]  Because Trump was ahead to cheat him and take him out of the lead.
[04:53.080 --> 04:54.080]  Stay with us.
[04:54.080 --> 04:56.200]  We'll be right back.
[04:56.200 --> 05:06.280]  Trump slams Hillary's DNC speech and denounces her globalist agenda.
[05:06.280 --> 05:11.680]  Donald Trump immediately reacted to Hillary Clinton's keynote speech at the Democratic
[05:11.680 --> 05:17.760]  National Convention last night, sending out a series of tweets hitting her on her economic
[05:17.760 --> 05:19.680]  and foreign policies.
[05:19.680 --> 05:25.440]  Trump says Hillary will never reform Wall Street because she is owned by Wall Street.
[05:25.440 --> 05:32.040]  And he says that Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power,
[05:32.040 --> 05:34.600]  no jobs, and no safety.
[05:34.600 --> 05:40.560]  Trump also slammed Hillary for being soft on the threat of terrorism, noting that Americans'
[05:40.560 --> 05:46.960]  way of life is under threat by radical Islam, and Hillary Clinton can't even bring herself
[05:46.960 --> 05:48.520]  to say the words.
[05:48.520 --> 05:55.200]  And in a final tweet, Trump urged that no one has worse judgment than Hillary Clinton.
[05:55.200 --> 06:07.040]  And you can learn more right now at infowars.com.
[06:07.040 --> 06:15.640]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Commence Center and the heart of the Resistance,
[06:15.640 --> 06:22.200]  rallying Patriots worldwide.
[06:22.200 --> 06:39.120]  We're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[06:39.120 --> 06:44.520]  Stand up and be counted, my friends.
[06:44.520 --> 06:47.680]  Are you going to stand for free and open elections?
[06:47.680 --> 06:50.680]  Are you going to stand against corruption?
[06:50.680 --> 07:00.760]  Or are you going to allow the next level of tyranny and crookedness and a rigged system
[07:00.760 --> 07:04.200]  to openly be practiced in this country?
[07:04.200 --> 07:07.640]  I shot a special report yesterday that's really an announcement.
[07:07.640 --> 07:10.560]  It's titled An Emergency Message to Donald Trump.
[07:10.560 --> 07:14.600]  It's red linked on infowars.com and prisonplata.com.
[07:14.600 --> 07:17.120]  Right now we tweeted it out at Real Alex Jones.
[07:17.120 --> 07:18.120]  Please retweet it.
[07:18.120 --> 07:23.160]  It's also posted on our Facebook channels.
[07:23.160 --> 07:28.760]  And in it, I lay out the fact that infowars, starting yesterday, is going to be producing
[07:28.760 --> 07:42.080]  many documentaries, political factoid news reports, investigative journal reports, chronicling
[07:42.080 --> 07:48.440]  the entire giant spectrum of rigging that is going on.
[07:48.440 --> 07:52.640]  From Google admitting, they don't list Donald Trump as, quote, a presidential candidate on
[07:52.640 --> 07:54.840]  their page.
[07:54.840 --> 07:59.600]  Twitter admitting they've been blocking Donald Trump tweets being shared.
[07:59.600 --> 08:03.400]  Facebook engaged in massive censorship across the board.
[08:03.400 --> 08:08.280]  There's even congressional investigations.
[08:08.280 --> 08:10.640]  It is truly unprecedented.
[08:10.640 --> 08:15.840]  So whether you love Donald Trump or hate him, you have to understand, they tried in more
[08:15.840 --> 08:24.320]  than 14 states to give the votes that Donald Trump got winning Louisiana, Colorado, and
[08:24.320 --> 08:29.080]  countless other states to Ted Cruz.
[08:29.080 --> 08:30.600]  And Donald Trump didn't play along with it.
[08:30.600 --> 08:32.920]  He didn't go along with it like Bernie Sanders.
[08:32.920 --> 08:37.600]  And that's when suddenly he started seeing Cruz sink in the polls despite the mainstream
[08:37.600 --> 08:41.160]  media trying to prop him up.
[08:41.160 --> 08:45.720]  Now the Democrats are in Politico, they're in the Fort Worth Star Telegram, and I happen
[08:45.720 --> 08:52.000]  to know from some high level political consultants that have been meeting with the Democrats
[08:52.000 --> 09:02.480]  and who are our quizlings that they believe that they're going to be able to get enough
[09:02.480 --> 09:10.360]  for Trump people to vote in Texas to be able to throw the state Democrat.
[09:10.360 --> 09:16.840]  And if Trump loses Texas, he will lose the election, have the second most delegates.
[09:16.840 --> 09:20.560]  And I've been around these Cruz people, they are mentally ill.
[09:20.560 --> 09:22.800]  They are a cult.
[09:22.800 --> 09:28.000]  You've got Glenn Beck on ABC News with Democratic operative saying, don't vote for Trump, vote
[09:28.000 --> 09:32.520]  for somebody else, well that's a vote for Hillary.
[09:32.520 --> 09:37.200]  You look at the electoral college, to see my beloved Texas hijacked by that Canadian
[09:37.200 --> 09:43.520]  Cuban carpetbagger, scallywag of the highest order.
[09:43.520 --> 09:48.480]  And to see, I mean he fits the definition in spades.
[09:48.480 --> 09:54.600]  If Texas does this, I'm going to be completely ashamed, I'm going to be quite honest with
[09:54.600 --> 09:55.600]  you.
[09:55.600 --> 09:58.240]  I'm not going to say Texas will, because we keep our word around here, and Ted Cruz
[09:58.240 --> 09:59.880]  broke his.
[09:59.880 --> 10:04.080]  But I am, and by the way, I used to admire Ted Cruz, he's very well-spoken, very smart.
[10:04.080 --> 10:07.600]  I said, yeah, his wife's Goldman Sachs, yeah, he came up with the bushes, but maybe he's
[10:07.600 --> 10:09.360]  turning against him.
[10:09.360 --> 10:18.520]  But boy, I tell you, he absolutely did a 180, and it is so sad.
[10:18.520 --> 10:24.920]  And you've got a bunch of spiteful, so-called Texans, big hats, no cattle, wearing their
[10:24.920 --> 10:28.720]  Texas shirts, who think that they're going to do this.
[10:28.720 --> 10:32.480]  In fact, they don't even need to get enough of them to go vote for Cruz as a throwaway
[10:32.480 --> 10:37.360]  vote to throw it to Hillary.
[10:37.360 --> 10:46.000]  That is you to create that perception, so people believe Texas goes for Hillary.
[10:46.000 --> 10:48.920]  They just have to have plausible anonymity.
[10:48.920 --> 10:53.280]  And I hope, if that happens, they're very, very, very proud of themselves, and they frame
[10:53.280 --> 10:57.960]  their little Texas shirts they wear, and their little cowboy hats, and their little boots
[10:57.960 --> 11:01.880]  that never stepped in manure before.
[11:01.880 --> 11:09.280]  So this is a war against reality.
[11:09.280 --> 11:13.320]  The whole Black Lives Matter thing, the whole Hillary vote for me because I'm a woman, you
[11:13.320 --> 11:18.880]  bet I'm playing the woman card, all of this is a total fraud.
[11:18.880 --> 11:23.080]  Obama helped double black unemployment, and people say, why did he give less support to
[11:23.080 --> 11:25.080]  black neighborhoods than the other group?
[11:25.080 --> 11:26.720]  Because he's already got you under his thumb.
[11:26.720 --> 11:31.720]  He wants you like a pimp, wants you absolutely down and out under his control.
[11:31.720 --> 11:34.360]  This is a process.
[11:34.360 --> 11:39.880]  And the evil old Republican establishment is nakedly allied with the Democratic establishment,
[11:39.880 --> 11:44.280]  and all the big foreign leaders and the Pope and the Communist Chinese and the Saudi Arabians
[11:44.280 --> 11:49.280]  that throw gay people off rooftops and chop their heads off for heaven's sakes, and the
[11:49.280 --> 11:54.880]  Mexican president, all of them, the whole world, against Trump, but I'll tell you, from Mexico
[11:54.880 --> 12:01.080]  and Chile and from Australia and Africa and all over, I see people on YouTube and on
[12:01.080 --> 12:05.560]  Info Wars saying, I'd support Trump, I see right through it, he's a nationalist, he's
[12:05.560 --> 12:11.240]  a sovereign person that wants you to be wealthy, absolutely, it's so clear, that's why they're
[12:11.240 --> 12:12.240]  scared of him.
[12:12.240 --> 12:17.400]  So the people across the board are waking up and seeing what's happening, populism is
[12:17.400 --> 12:23.240]  rising across the planet, I'm going to come back and play this special message to Donald
[12:23.240 --> 12:31.360]  Trump and to the American people where I lay out just some of the evidence of this, but
[12:31.360 --> 12:38.240]  when you see the things they're doing and everything's being engaged in and the lies
[12:38.240 --> 12:43.560]  and the misrepresentations, just like I see ads online and I see it on broadcast, people
[12:43.560 --> 12:49.480]  saying I'm voting against Donald Trump because he's anti-gay, Hillary Clinton, I mean it's
[12:49.480 --> 12:52.840]  actually something conservatives should be mad at Trump for, if you want to go the cruise
[12:52.840 --> 12:57.840]  route, he didn't go that direction, criticizing Trump, Trump was in the advocate for equal
[12:57.840 --> 13:02.960]  rights and people being able to get married 30 years ago, Trump's never made that his
[13:02.960 --> 13:10.640]  issue and in his own nomination speech made that clear, they don't care, I see it everywhere
[13:10.640 --> 13:15.800]  saying Donald Trump wants to bring back black segregation, we got a new video of that we're
[13:15.800 --> 13:19.920]  going to play, they've got people saying he wants to go after gay people, it's just total
[13:19.920 --> 13:28.760]  BS, he wants to ship blacks back to Africa, all he said was if we're not vetting anybody
[13:28.760 --> 13:34.160]  coming in from Syria and we don't even check their IDs, we've got to stop all of it till
[13:34.160 --> 13:38.080]  we start the vetting process again, that's like if gas is leaking in your house, you
[13:38.080 --> 13:44.840]  turn the gas off until it's fixed or if your pipe burst, you go turn the water off, first
[13:44.840 --> 13:48.880]  he said they're murdering Christians, we got to bring them in, they went excuse me sir,
[13:48.880 --> 13:54.600]  they don't let Christians in, it's 20% Christian in Syria but it's 0.3% Obama let's in, these
[13:54.600 --> 14:02.640]  are ISIS, they went excuse me and did a 180, not in a flip flop but when he got more info,
[14:02.640 --> 14:09.160]  so again, it is an inverted reality, Donald Trump wants to cut taxes, Donald Trump knows
[14:09.160 --> 14:14.200]  we have one sided deals with China and India and over 160 other third world countries,
[14:14.200 --> 14:18.400]  we're falling apart, the Wall Street Journal admits that this is the worst recovery in
[14:18.400 --> 14:24.960]  our history and that our economy is falling apart and that's with cook numbers, the Wall
[14:24.960 --> 14:29.240]  Street Journal looks at the fake numbers that every major economist admit are fake, the
[14:29.240 --> 14:34.640]  employment numbers, the inflation numbers, the welfare numbers, seven years later recovery
[14:34.640 --> 14:39.960]  remains the weakest of the post-World War II era, we've been in a long term depression
[14:39.960 --> 14:46.040]  for most people, a recession for others and tiny groups of elites have never made bigger
[14:46.040 --> 14:49.880]  profits, the big banks never made bigger profits, the insurance companies never made
[14:49.880 --> 14:56.200]  bigger profits and you notice who the big banks Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan and the
[14:56.200 --> 15:01.800]  big insurance companies are financing, they're not giving $1 to Donald Trump, big pharma,
[15:01.800 --> 15:07.000]  zero to Donald Trump, the defense contractors, nothing to Trump because he was against the
[15:07.000 --> 15:12.240]  Iraq war and he's not for attacking people that aren't attacking us, that's why they
[15:12.240 --> 15:18.120]  call him a warmonger to the left and you have these pseudo intellectual leftists brought
[15:18.120 --> 15:22.400]  up without families, desperate scared, all they've got is their trendiness, they felt
[15:22.400 --> 15:29.160]  like nerds, the system packaged being a nerd is the new cool and now they've given up any
[15:29.160 --> 15:34.160]  intellectualism just to feel official and powerful and cool when the whole power structure
[15:34.160 --> 15:40.840]  is against Donald Trump and Donald Trump is now says he's taking the gloves off, well
[15:40.840 --> 15:45.040]  that's good because when we come back we're going to talk about the number one way to

[20:02.840 --> 20:30.720]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:30.720 --> 20:35.240]  Every globalist, every new world order operator is activating right now and showing their
[20:35.240 --> 20:37.640]  true colors.
[20:37.640 --> 20:42.600]  The Washington Post, the Financial Times of London, the Economist magazine, and scores
[20:42.600 --> 20:47.600]  of others in the last week have all come out and said the new world order, they use that
[20:47.600 --> 20:51.360]  term, is in trouble.
[20:51.360 --> 20:54.680]  World government is in trouble.
[20:54.680 --> 20:57.720]  Liberal global governance is in trouble.
[20:57.720 --> 20:58.720]  That's a new term.
[20:58.720 --> 21:03.160]  Liberal, and they say, we're going to open the borders up, and we're going to get the
[21:03.160 --> 21:07.400]  third world all these free goodies, and so that's who we're going to represent, and that's
[21:07.400 --> 21:12.400]  how we're going to end the republics, the limited democracies, is we're going to bring
[21:12.400 --> 21:17.400]  in outside groups to outvote you, and the Trump campaign is resisting that.
[21:17.400 --> 21:19.760]  It's the end of sovereignty.
[21:19.760 --> 21:22.760]  It's the end of nation-states.
[21:22.760 --> 21:25.800]  It's the end of being able to run somewhere.
[21:25.800 --> 21:32.160]  It's a global government, and they go on in the Economist, in an article titled The New
[21:32.160 --> 21:36.360]  Political Divide, to say, all of our hopes are in Hillary Clinton.
[21:36.360 --> 21:39.200]  We must get her in office, or world government is in trouble.
[21:39.200 --> 21:40.200]  Go read the article.
[21:40.200 --> 21:41.720]  It's on screen for TV viewers.
[21:41.720 --> 21:46.400]  We're simulcasting, and infowars.com, forward slash shows, we always do.
[21:46.400 --> 21:47.400]  But here's the AP.
[21:47.400 --> 21:49.920]  Just to set the table of what we're fighting.
[21:49.920 --> 21:56.920]  Step too young on Poland trip, believe in a new humanity, ah, transhumanism, Krakow,
[21:56.920 --> 22:03.360]  Poland, AP, Pope Francis encouraged hundreds of thousands of young people at a global gathering
[22:03.360 --> 22:10.440]  Sunday to believe in a new humanity, close quote, that is stronger than evil, and refuses
[22:10.440 --> 22:16.720]  to see borders or barriers, ah, and of course he wants wealth redistribution, but not from
[22:16.720 --> 22:21.200]  the Vatican trust, the richest institution on the planet.
[22:21.200 --> 22:23.440]  He doesn't want to bring refugees into where he is.
[22:23.440 --> 22:27.960]  He washes the feet of Muslims, but he doesn't wash the feet of people blown up by suicide
[22:27.960 --> 22:29.760]  bombers or their families.
[22:29.760 --> 22:34.600]  But notice he says, refuse to see, refuse to see, that's delusion.
[22:34.600 --> 22:36.600]  God wants us to have knowledge and understanding.
[22:36.600 --> 22:42.760]  The devil dumps it all down where it's just feelings and buying into, oh, oh, I refuse
[22:42.760 --> 22:45.520]  to see.
[22:45.520 --> 22:50.920]  He wants you to refuse to see and just, oh, walk off the cliff like Felsa Doom and cut
[22:50.920 --> 22:56.480]  in the barberry and he says, steel isn't strong boy, flesh is stronger.
[22:56.480 --> 23:02.440]  See that little girl up there on the, up there on the crag, up there on the cliff.
[23:02.440 --> 23:06.880]  Come to me, come to me my child, and she just jumps off and kills herself.
[23:06.880 --> 23:10.920]  And that's what he says, don't see anything.
[23:10.920 --> 23:14.360]  Don't see who runs the global government, the IMF and World Bank and the new global
[23:14.360 --> 23:15.360]  carbon tax.
[23:15.360 --> 23:18.440]  Don't see the plans they have.
[23:18.440 --> 23:24.400]  Don't see how the megabanks exempt themselves from taxes, just don't see borders.
[23:24.400 --> 23:30.000]  Remember he said he was nauseated by Christianity and colonialism and people complaining about
[23:30.000 --> 23:37.160]  how Europe was a Christian area and bringing more migrants to rape and kill and give them
[23:37.160 --> 23:42.800]  everything free because Pope Francis is a new World Order globalist.
[23:42.800 --> 23:46.240]  They blackmailed the last pope to step down with sex scandals, that was even the London
[23:46.240 --> 23:51.400]  Guardian and they brought in a Jesuit communist pope.
[23:51.400 --> 23:57.680]  World governments making its move.
[23:57.680 --> 24:03.880]  Now I'm going to come back from break, Roger Stone is spending, I believe a full hour with
[24:03.880 --> 24:10.560]  us, former Trump campaign head, his business partner, Mr. Manafort, is the current head
[24:10.560 --> 24:12.560]  of the campaign.
[24:12.560 --> 24:18.400]  He wants to play down his importance and his role, but obviously it's quite the opposite.
[24:18.400 --> 24:22.240]  And his initiatives mesh with mine on how to defeat the globalist.
[24:22.240 --> 24:25.400]  I see the guys totally truth-based, that's what they call them, the big liar and the
[24:25.400 --> 24:28.160]  dirtiest trickster ever and the rest of it.
[24:28.160 --> 24:34.080]  But he concurs with my analysis, we had long meetings this weekend, well Friday and Saturday
[24:34.080 --> 24:41.920]  on the phone, and he agrees we need to make the central issue election fraud.
[24:41.920 --> 24:45.720]  So we're going to play this special report and then I'm going to come back and break
[24:45.720 --> 24:48.080]  down how they're already doing it in different ways.
[24:48.080 --> 24:53.000]  It's not just stealing at the day of, it's what they do before and if we know about it,
[24:53.000 --> 24:58.040]  people now accept that Hillary's so crooked and evil and corrupt, it'll blow up in her
[24:58.040 --> 24:59.040]  face.
[24:59.040 --> 25:03.720]  Let's go to this report, we come back from break because I won't have time to do it
[25:03.720 --> 25:04.720]  now.
[25:04.720 --> 25:10.640]  But Trump's genius is that when they try to bully him, he realizes that dinosaur media
[25:10.640 --> 25:16.520]  isn't dominant anymore because he is able, pun intended, to trump them because of his
[25:16.520 --> 25:20.760]  incredible star appeal, the gravitas, the fact that they can't ignore him.
[25:20.760 --> 25:25.480]  Though they try, they try to steal down clips of his speeches that aren't as powerful and
[25:25.480 --> 25:31.480]  then that gives the media little sniblets they can cut out, little giblets that misrepresent
[25:31.480 --> 25:32.480]  what he's saying.
[25:32.480 --> 25:39.360]  But when you will sit there and watch him give a beautiful, rambling, from the heart,
[25:39.360 --> 25:44.320]  two hour speech, I mean, he gives like four or five of these a weekend, sometimes like
[25:44.320 --> 25:48.360]  10 hour long ones and I just, I hate missing them.
[25:48.360 --> 25:51.560]  I sit there with my children around the dinner table, which we never used to do and, you
[25:51.560 --> 25:56.280]  know, have the computer over there and I just say this, listen to this.
[25:56.280 --> 26:00.280]  He does some colloquial stuff about the locals and their businesses and their lives, you
[26:00.280 --> 26:04.240]  know, to humanize things.
[26:04.240 --> 26:08.880]  But when he gets into the era of economic surrender is over, Hillary's a communist,
[26:08.880 --> 26:09.880]  Chinese spy.
[26:09.880 --> 26:10.880]  She is.
[26:10.880 --> 26:18.280]  I mean, I talked to retired and I mean recently retired top generals and they go, no, look,
[26:18.280 --> 26:20.000]  I can't tell you what's going on.
[26:20.000 --> 26:21.000]  Go read this news article.
[26:21.000 --> 26:22.000]  It's got it right.
[26:22.000 --> 26:25.960]  And I go read the article and it's Hillary Clinton's time as Chinese spy or I've talked
[26:25.960 --> 26:28.960]  to top people.
[26:28.960 --> 26:29.960]  You hear a lot of them on the air.
[26:29.960 --> 26:35.880]  Not, you know, Psi Hersh, you name it, but people just say, go read this news article.
[26:35.880 --> 26:36.880]  That's accurate.
[26:36.880 --> 26:41.320]  And you go read the news article and it's Matt Bracken saying they're planning a Tet
[26:41.320 --> 26:42.760]  two offensive in the fall.
[26:42.760 --> 26:47.040]  And this is a year ago and now you see it happening with Islamics.
[26:47.040 --> 26:53.120]  They're strongly considering activating Black Lives Matter, having false flags where massive
[26:53.120 --> 26:57.120]  numbers of innocent blacks are killed and trying to cause a race war.
[26:57.120 --> 26:58.560]  We told you that a long time ago.
[26:58.560 --> 27:00.440]  Obviously, you can see that too.
[27:00.440 --> 27:05.160]  All of us see this, but they're really got a lot of different agendas going and are strongly
[27:05.160 --> 27:11.080]  considering creating such a crisis, Obama could suspend the election or we're in such
[27:11.080 --> 27:15.480]  turmoil and they have the election that people are distracted that Trump's had the election
[27:15.480 --> 27:20.800]  stolen from him by cities burning.
[27:20.800 --> 27:22.000]  The new world order is making its move.
[27:22.000 --> 27:32.160]  Now I want to play a clip first as we go to break from Trump earlier this week.
[27:32.160 --> 27:36.840]  And I happen to know for a fact that the Trump campaign, whenever it came out that the Russians
[27:36.840 --> 27:43.840]  had supposedly hacked his emails and from my sources, it is the Russians and it shows
[27:43.840 --> 27:47.720]  Hillary that these are the emails she would give her to the FBI earlier, but it also shows
[27:47.720 --> 27:52.440]  the DNC in there stealing the election from Sanders, sending protesters to Trump, which
[27:52.440 --> 27:56.400]  they denied and having him dressed up like Sanders supporters and saying, we don't care
[27:56.400 --> 27:58.360]  what happens where we've got the super delegates.
[27:58.360 --> 27:59.600]  It's proof of the fraud.
[27:59.600 --> 28:01.520]  Thank God they're doing that.
[28:01.520 --> 28:06.480]  They realize America is being occupied by a political corporate globalist coup that wants
[28:06.480 --> 28:07.480]  to attack Russia.
[28:07.480 --> 28:12.600]  So it's in Russia's interest and in our interest to have this exposed.
[28:12.600 --> 28:16.600]  Globalism is where you're conquered by big megabanks.
[28:16.600 --> 28:21.960]  So when we come back, we've got this clip first and then his report, my report, but we
[28:21.960 --> 28:30.240]  have clips of Trump warning of election fraud that is so important, but Trump countermanded
[28:30.240 --> 28:33.880]  his advisors and people that had come out and denied it was Russians earlier on and
[28:33.880 --> 28:35.480]  came out and said, I don't know who it is.
[28:35.480 --> 28:36.960]  I'm not talking to the Russians.
[28:36.960 --> 28:39.680]  By the way, he's not.
[28:39.680 --> 28:43.440]  But if you got Hillary's emails, the one she deleted released them.
[28:43.440 --> 28:44.440]  She's a criminal.
[28:44.440 --> 28:45.440]  He just doubled down.
[28:45.440 --> 28:46.440]  He owned it.
[28:46.440 --> 28:47.440]  He's such a leader.
[28:47.440 --> 28:48.440]  And that's why they're scared of him.
[28:48.440 --> 28:49.440]  He wants to save this country.
[28:49.440 --> 28:50.440]  Folks.
[28:50.440 --> 28:52.680]  That's why the whole power structure is going after Donald Trump.
[28:52.680 --> 28:55.680]  Shame on anyone that doesn't vote for him.
[28:55.680 --> 29:01.200]  Hey, everyone, pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side.
[29:01.200 --> 29:05.040]  And as many of you know, I'm on a mission to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[29:05.040 --> 29:07.320]  You all heard the shocking statistics.
[29:07.320 --> 29:11.920]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman and child in
[29:11.920 --> 29:17.400]  this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[29:17.400 --> 29:20.680]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone
[29:20.680 --> 29:23.320]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[29:23.320 --> 29:26.520]  If you are dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain

[30:25.240 --> 30:28.560]  your children, to the best job you can to purify your air.
[30:28.560 --> 30:33.560]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment, while themselves doing things that mitigate
[30:33.560 --> 30:36.560]  or avoid most of the toxic effects to themselves.
[30:36.560 --> 30:38.760]  The general public doesn't.
[30:38.760 --> 30:42.720]  The Alexa Pure Breeze will be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[30:42.720 --> 30:46.360]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[30:46.360 --> 30:49.880]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[30:49.880 --> 30:53.120]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.
[30:53.120 --> 30:57.040]  Find out why this system is so revolutionary today, at InfowarsStore.com.
[30:57.040 --> 31:01.080]  Dr. Grip, you developed Living Defense for us.
[31:01.080 --> 31:02.440]  It took you over a year to do it.
[31:02.440 --> 31:04.160]  Why is this so good?
[31:04.160 --> 31:08.720]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[31:08.720 --> 31:13.480]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[31:13.480 --> 31:19.200]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[31:19.200 --> 31:22.520]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[31:22.520 --> 31:27.640]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[31:27.640 --> 31:28.880]  going on everywhere.
[31:28.880 --> 31:29.880]  These are all parasites.
[31:29.880 --> 31:32.600]  Tell us about all the stuff that said there's so many things that are in it.
[31:32.600 --> 31:33.840]  You have the neem in there.
[31:33.840 --> 31:36.920]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[31:36.920 --> 31:40.280]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[31:40.280 --> 31:41.280]  All right.
[31:41.280 --> 31:43.400]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[31:43.400 --> 31:47.320]  It just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, InfowarsLife.com, and folks, you can't lose
[31:47.320 --> 31:50.240]  it's full of stuff that's great for your body, period.
[31:50.240 --> 31:53.520]  And you support the broadcast, InfowarsLife.com.
[31:53.520 --> 31:55.720]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[31:55.720 --> 31:59.120]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[31:59.120 --> 32:03.280]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but we're waiting for an
[32:03.280 --> 32:07.400]  outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[32:07.400 --> 32:08.400]  Here's why.
[32:08.400 --> 32:12.280]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems, and it's getting worse.
[32:12.280 --> 32:13.360]  So please listen.
[32:13.360 --> 32:18.520]  Solar generators really do provide life-saving electrical power, and unlike gas generators,
[32:18.520 --> 32:22.720]  solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce electricity from the
[32:22.720 --> 32:23.720]  sun.
[32:23.720 --> 32:28.200]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going
[32:28.200 --> 32:30.600]  to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[32:30.600 --> 32:33.280]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[32:33.280 --> 32:37.880]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators, and they're
[32:37.880 --> 32:42.400]  giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off-the-grid gear in addition to the low
[32:42.400 --> 32:46.200]  price for M4Wars listeners, so it's a good time to check it out.
[32:46.200 --> 32:49.640]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.
[32:49.640 --> 32:53.480]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[32:53.480 --> 32:58.720]  Go to gridwars.com, that's gridwars.com.
[32:58.720 --> 33:13.400]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[33:13.400 --> 33:15.240]  We are on the march.
[33:15.240 --> 33:18.280]  The empire is on the run.
[33:18.280 --> 33:24.720]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[33:24.720 --> 33:32.200]  So here are the headlines, after non-endorsement, will Texans stand by U.S. Senator Cruz as the
[33:32.200 --> 33:39.080]  establishment media tries to get the never-Trump people to either not vote or vote for Hillary
[33:39.080 --> 33:42.240]  or write his name in so Donald Trump loses.
[33:42.240 --> 33:44.000]  They'll probably do it.
[33:44.000 --> 33:45.640]  They're very proud of themselves.
[33:45.640 --> 33:51.800]  Pat Cadel blasts Reuters back-rigging polls to show Clinton up.
[33:51.800 --> 33:53.960]  They've been caught just engaging fraud, basically.
[33:53.960 --> 33:59.080]  Speaking exclusively to Breitbart News, political polling pioneer Pat Cadel said the Reuters
[33:59.080 --> 34:03.040]  news service was guilty of an unprecedented act of professional malpractice.
[34:03.040 --> 34:09.160]  After it announced Friday, it was dropping the neither option from their presidential
[34:09.160 --> 34:13.760]  campaign tracking polls and then went back to reconfiguring previously released polls
[34:13.760 --> 34:19.240]  to present different results with a reinterpretation of the new neither.
[34:19.240 --> 34:23.240]  And again, that's to get rid of the closeted Trump supporters I keep talking about.
[34:23.240 --> 34:25.360]  That's the big secret.
[34:25.360 --> 34:32.520]  The big secret weapon is that we've never seen so many closeted people that are ashamed
[34:32.520 --> 34:36.760]  to say they're voting for Trump, but we know they're there, the numbers show it.
[34:36.760 --> 34:41.080]  And so that's why Hillary and others are so scared right now and why they're having Reuters
[34:41.080 --> 34:48.320]  go back in time over the last two weeks where Trump surged seven to 10 points ahead in scientific
[34:48.320 --> 34:53.320]  polls across the board, and it still shows that Trump's ahead and all the other big polls,
[34:53.320 --> 34:59.000]  but Reuters went back in time and memory hold it and is changing it to take out the neither
[34:59.000 --> 35:03.000]  and tweak stuff and just give it to Hillary.
[35:03.000 --> 35:04.840]  Some cases are giving her like seven points.
[35:04.840 --> 35:05.840]  They're adding on.
[35:05.840 --> 35:11.160]  I mean, this is putting your finger on the scale, but they stole the election in at least
[35:11.160 --> 35:13.120]  10 states from Sanders.
[35:13.120 --> 35:17.240]  He's the admitted winner.
[35:17.240 --> 35:21.360]  The Guardian reports not even my wife knows secret Donald Trump voters speak out.
[35:21.360 --> 35:23.360]  Oh yeah.
[35:23.360 --> 35:26.480]  And that's why this is going on.
[35:26.480 --> 35:28.080]  So this is a big, big deal.
[35:28.080 --> 35:34.160]  Now I'm going to play this clip because I mentioned it of Trump saying, hey, I don't
[35:34.160 --> 35:39.800]  know the Russians, but yeah, they've got emails of Hillary doing corrupt stuff.
[35:39.800 --> 35:40.800]  Please release more.
[35:40.800 --> 35:41.800]  Absolutely.
[35:41.800 --> 35:44.040]  Who cares if it comes from the Easter Bunny?
[35:44.040 --> 35:45.880]  Don't change the subject.
[35:45.880 --> 35:47.200]  You deleted the emails.
[35:47.200 --> 35:48.960]  You wouldn't give the FBI the emails.
[35:48.960 --> 35:50.520]  You lied about it all.
[35:50.520 --> 35:53.160]  Let's see what's in there, but we know what's in there.
[35:53.160 --> 36:00.040]  And the word is, I'm afraid the Russians and others, there's others, are going to be released
[36:00.040 --> 36:02.480]  in all the goodies, Hillary.
[36:02.480 --> 36:06.400]  That's why they're getting ready to start a race war or a class war with all the communists
[36:06.400 --> 36:07.400]  right now.
[36:07.400 --> 36:10.320]  That's what cops every couple of days get the shot in the back of the heads about.
[36:10.320 --> 36:15.560]  Again, the establishments pull out the stops, folks.
[36:15.560 --> 36:16.960]  Let's go ahead and play that club.
[36:16.960 --> 36:19.240]  What do I have to get involved with Putin for?
[36:19.240 --> 36:20.360]  I have nothing to do with Putin.
[36:20.360 --> 36:21.360]  I've never spoken to him.
[36:21.360 --> 36:24.520]  I don't know anything about him other than he will respect me.
[36:24.520 --> 36:27.080]  He doesn't respect our president.
[36:27.080 --> 36:32.760]  And if it is Russia, which is probably not, nobody knows who it is, but if it is Russia,
[36:32.760 --> 36:37.800]  it's really bad for a different reason because it shows how little respect they have for
[36:37.800 --> 36:45.880]  our country when they would hack into a major party and get everything.
[36:45.880 --> 36:51.360]  But it would be interesting to see, I will tell you this, Russia, if you're listening,
[36:51.360 --> 36:57.960]  I hope you're able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing.
[36:57.960 --> 37:02.880]  I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press.
[37:02.880 --> 37:03.880]  Let's see if that happens.
[37:03.880 --> 37:04.880]  That'll be next.
[37:04.880 --> 37:05.880]  Yes, sir.
[37:05.880 --> 37:08.800]  God in heaven, please give us Donald Trump.
[37:08.800 --> 37:11.000]  That's why the elite hate him.
[37:11.000 --> 37:14.240]  They brought in all these crooks, all these globalists, all these special interests.
[37:14.240 --> 37:15.480]  They're carving the country up.
[37:15.480 --> 37:21.720]  They've already sold out 87% of our industry, compared to what we had in the 1960s.
[37:21.720 --> 37:26.200]  They preside over selling our deals, Pecharia.
[37:26.200 --> 37:29.880]  From one of the richest families in India, the head of the UN Climate Fund at the time,
[37:29.880 --> 37:37.280]  seven years ago, get a carbon deal with England, where he got the brits to give up their final
[37:37.280 --> 37:40.880]  steel mills that were powered by coal plants that were clean.
[37:40.880 --> 37:42.680]  And here's the best part.
[37:42.680 --> 37:46.880]  He had them pay in a carbon indulgence to build a dirty plant.
[37:46.880 --> 37:53.000]  His son owned an India worth over $500 million.
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.920]  Donald Trump isn't going to do that.
[37:55.920 --> 38:02.000]  That guy is so hard-nosed, with him as a negotiator for this country.
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.160]  I've seen these videos of architects and people bitching.
[38:04.160 --> 38:09.280]  I actually went into the research, oh, I built a clubhouse for Trump, and then he only gave
[38:09.280 --> 38:12.040]  me like 20% of what I was supposedly, no, no, no.
[38:12.040 --> 38:14.280]  You said it'd be one price, then it ballooned.
[38:14.280 --> 38:15.440]  Trump hard-nosed you.
[38:15.440 --> 38:16.440]  You agreed to it.
[38:16.440 --> 38:19.560]  That's how business works.
[38:19.560 --> 38:22.720]  I mean, I get distributors on the line and I say, I'm not going to carry a product anymore.
[38:22.720 --> 38:23.720]  It's really good.
[38:23.720 --> 38:24.720]  It's really low price.
[38:24.720 --> 38:28.840]  If somebody else basically is good, they'll go lower and allow me to sell it even lower.
[38:28.840 --> 38:33.600]  I only want to make 20, 30% on this, so I'm the dominant person in the field, and then
[38:33.600 --> 38:34.600]  I can fund myself.
[38:34.600 --> 38:39.400]  And they go, no, we're not, and I say, okay, I'm leaving then.
[38:39.400 --> 38:40.400]  And you know what?
[38:40.400 --> 38:43.040]  They call me up a week later and say, okay, we'll do that deal, but you've got to private
[38:43.040 --> 38:44.040]  label it.
[38:44.040 --> 38:45.040]  And I'm not bashing my great sponsors.
[38:45.040 --> 38:46.040]  They're wonderful people.
[38:46.040 --> 38:49.320]  You know, you can get the super high quality, best storeable foods out there, today's the
[38:49.320 --> 38:52.760]  day it ends, 40% off, and then fullwarstore.com.
[38:52.760 --> 38:54.760]  40% off.
[38:54.760 --> 38:57.800]  You notice I can only offer that like once a year before.
[38:57.800 --> 39:00.440]  I'm just twisting arms, but that's what I do.
[39:00.440 --> 39:06.040]  I'm sorry the other distributors and the other sellers don't like it, that I'm selling it
[39:06.040 --> 39:07.040]  for lower prices.
[39:07.040 --> 39:08.040]  I'm a capitalist.
[39:08.040 --> 39:10.240]  Get used to it.
[39:10.240 --> 39:16.160]  I'd rather sell 5 million hamburgers with a lower profit per one and make way more.
[39:16.160 --> 39:17.160]  It's not rocket science.
[39:17.160 --> 39:18.160]  I'm an American.
[39:18.160 --> 39:19.160]  Get used to it.
[39:19.160 --> 39:20.920]  Sorry nobody wants to compete.
[39:20.920 --> 39:23.280]  Sorry nobody wants to deal with me.
[39:23.280 --> 39:26.160]  Same thing with Donald Trump.
[39:26.160 --> 39:32.240]  So we've got sales on all the nutraceuticals, the water filters, the air purifiers, all
[39:32.240 --> 39:35.640]  the great quality products that we've researched that I personally use, that we give you the
[39:35.640 --> 39:37.600]  very best deals you're going to find anywhere.
[39:37.600 --> 39:43.120]  40% off brain force and it's dropping, colloidal silver, antibiotic, natural antibiotic, and
[39:43.120 --> 39:44.120]  so much more.
[39:44.120 --> 39:45.720]  X2, supermail vitality.
[39:45.720 --> 39:46.720]  Take advantage of it.
[39:46.720 --> 39:47.720]  It ends today.
[39:47.720 --> 39:55.720]  M4warstore.com, M4warslife.com, or call toll free, 888-253-3139.
[39:55.720 --> 40:00.280]  And I want to thank all the listeners, all the viewers that have really supported us in
[40:00.280 --> 40:08.520]  the last four or five days that we've had this fundraiser mega sale going because we
[40:08.520 --> 40:13.440]  have brought in the capital I need to know that I can budget continuing on in the next
[40:13.440 --> 40:20.720]  year with the crew I have and to get additional camera people, editors, and reporters.
[40:20.720 --> 40:22.520]  It's about what we wanted.
[40:22.520 --> 40:26.480]  We actually exceeded our targets a little bit.
[40:26.480 --> 40:27.680]  But I'm a gutsy guy.
[40:27.680 --> 40:31.320]  I have dumped everything in this year because everything's on the line.
[40:31.320 --> 40:35.560]  So now we've just budgeted where I can safely get a few more crew so we're not walking around
[40:35.560 --> 40:37.160]  18 hours a day here, cross-eyed.
[40:37.160 --> 40:38.160]  We're so exhausted.
[40:38.160 --> 40:39.160]  I mean, and I'm not complaining.
[40:39.160 --> 40:40.520]  Let me tell you, I'm animated.
[40:40.520 --> 40:43.960]  I was so upset Friday and Saturday that I was up here late Friday night.
[40:43.960 --> 40:46.840]  I was up here yesterday, basically, for most of the day.
[40:46.840 --> 40:48.640]  People say, well, aren't you with your kids?
[40:48.640 --> 40:49.640]  You know, I was with them in the morning.
[40:49.640 --> 40:50.640]  I was with them at night.
[40:50.640 --> 40:51.640]  I was with them today.
[40:51.640 --> 40:53.760]  I'm in a war, folks.
[40:53.760 --> 40:58.920]  I mean, I'm up here shooting special reports, doing investigations, going back and collating
[40:58.920 --> 41:03.320]  all the polls, all the research numbers, what state was stolen, where they tried to steal
[41:03.320 --> 41:06.400]  it to give it to my investigative journalist because I got some great writers and great
[41:06.400 --> 41:10.160]  folks, but quite frankly, when you see all these articles on M4wars, it's me.
[41:10.160 --> 41:11.160]  I'm sending links.
[41:11.160 --> 41:12.440]  I'm giving them the data dump.
[41:12.440 --> 41:17.440]  I'm giving them, you know, the dossier and saying, do this report, and they go out and
[41:17.440 --> 41:21.000]  dig up even more stuff than I found, and I'm not bragging, but let me tell you, you do
[41:21.000 --> 41:28.720]  not have someone more savagely committed, unless I have a great gut.
[41:28.720 --> 41:35.160]  I have a great six cents that God gave me, and I was there today with my children on
[41:35.160 --> 41:39.160]  the green belt swimming, and I know they need me.
[41:39.160 --> 41:44.000]  I'm the guy that takes care of them, and I knew that what I'm doing with Hillary and
[41:44.000 --> 41:47.280]  what I'm doing focusing on election fraud is there's been deaths of DNC, they had DNC
[41:47.280 --> 41:52.960]  guy over outreach that said it was fraud against Sanders, he was found, he was executed, recovering
[41:52.960 --> 41:53.960]  that up.
[41:53.960 --> 41:58.640]  DNC election fraud was the blower found murdered, another guy got murdered.
[41:58.640 --> 42:00.160]  I will never commit suicide.
[42:00.160 --> 42:05.320]  I don't use drugs, they'll grab you and shoot you up with heroin or whatever and kill you.
[42:05.320 --> 42:08.560]  You know, if they claim I have a heart attack at 42, I'm in great shape, I'm in the doctor,
[42:08.560 --> 42:12.440]  I have good blood pressure, I have just everything's good.
[42:12.440 --> 42:16.520]  My sugar is borderline, borderline, it's not borderline diabetic, it's, I've been blood
[42:16.520 --> 42:23.040]  testing it two weeks ago, it's borderline, borderline, it's a little high, but I got
[42:23.040 --> 42:28.840]  great health, and if anything happens to me, I was murdered, but listen, I'm not bitching
[42:28.840 --> 42:31.800]  and complaining, I'm gonna check out of here someday anyways.
[42:31.800 --> 42:36.440]  I'm one of those guys that is committed, I'm alive, I'm so alive, I'm ready to give it
[42:36.440 --> 42:40.960]  all up for my family and for you, because I don't like scum, I don't like con artists,
[42:40.960 --> 42:45.360]  I don't like them, and I know they're better men than better women, we're gonna be them.

[43:11.280 --> 43:13.520]  it's very, very important.
[43:13.520 --> 43:20.160]  What the aging process is, is when the cell replicates, we lose a little bit of our telomeres.
[43:20.160 --> 43:23.720]  Telomeres are the little cups on the end of our chromosomes, but when it runs out, you
[43:23.720 --> 43:24.720]  start dying.

[44:52.400 --> 44:55.120]  at infowarsteam.com have changed their lives.
[44:55.120 --> 44:59.040]  Check it out for yourself today.
[44:59.040 --> 45:03.440]  More than two years ago, infowars first told you about our research into what has been
[45:03.440 --> 45:05.120]  called the iodine conspiracy.
[45:05.120 --> 45:09.560]  I've told you about how scientists have known for decades that iodine deficiencies can
[45:09.560 --> 45:14.760]  devastate IQ, and how the government, knowingly, started taking iodine out of the food and
[45:14.760 --> 45:18.480]  adding fluoride, the bad member of the halogen family, into the water.
[45:18.480 --> 45:22.200]  They took the good halogen-O, and put the deadly halogen in.
[45:22.200 --> 45:26.720]  And when the Fukushima crisis worsened, as it still is worsening today, I was there telling
[45:26.720 --> 45:29.160]  you how to prepare yourself and your family.
[45:29.160 --> 45:34.640]  Now in 2016, even more information has been revealed concerning the connection between
[45:34.640 --> 45:40.400]  iodine and the gut, which many experts are now saying could be the biggest revelation
[45:40.400 --> 45:42.040]  ever concerning iodine.
[45:42.040 --> 45:43.960]  You can pull these studies up for yourself.
[45:43.960 --> 45:48.240]  This is the real deal, folks, and the truth is that iodine is essential, in my view, to
[45:48.240 --> 45:50.480]  any optimum health regimen.
[45:50.480 --> 45:58.920]  Look up on Survival Shield X2 Today at infowarslife.com, or by calling 888-253-3139.
[45:58.920 --> 46:03.080]  Introducing Vitamin Mineral Fusion from infowarslife.com.
[46:03.080 --> 46:07.080]  We have worked for years with our chemists and scientists to create the most powerful
[46:07.080 --> 46:10.560]  and affordable, great-tasting multivitamin formula available.

[46:56.560 --> 47:02.880]  Take action now before we sell out.
[47:02.880 --> 47:14.680]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[47:14.680 --> 47:17.680]  We are on the march.
[47:17.680 --> 47:26.680]  The empire is on the run.
[47:26.680 --> 47:29.880]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network.
[47:29.880 --> 47:35.680]  Everything the social engineers do is to make you feel powerless, make you feel weak, condition
[47:35.680 --> 47:40.200]  you that huge corruptions that are taking place don't matter.
[47:40.200 --> 47:45.120]  They're trying to condition us that Hillary can have hundreds of scandals and it's okay.
[47:45.120 --> 47:49.200]  You imagine what she'll do once she's in office.
[47:49.200 --> 47:56.880]  But it does show the arrogance of the establishment because I'm not putting a good face on this,
[47:56.880 --> 48:02.280]  but we've had reporters as well as myself all over the United States last year for this
[48:02.280 --> 48:03.280]  election.
[48:03.280 --> 48:04.680]  You've seen them.
[48:04.680 --> 48:10.040]  On the radio, you've heard them, where we have our reporters everywhere.
[48:10.040 --> 48:15.760]  And everybody talks about this online and my mother was talking about this yesterday
[48:15.760 --> 48:19.720]  to me and she used to be a Democrat.
[48:19.720 --> 48:22.120]  She's more of a libertarian.
[48:22.120 --> 48:25.280]  Most of her friends are hardcore liberals and they don't like Hillary Clinton.
[48:25.280 --> 48:29.200]  They hate her and they don't know who they're going to vote for.
[48:29.200 --> 48:33.800]  They're saying they're going to vote for somebody else.
[48:33.800 --> 48:38.800]  So where are they?
[48:38.800 --> 48:41.800]  And I'm not talking about, oh, you're in Texas, so that's Republican.
[48:41.800 --> 48:43.320]  I'm in Austin.
[48:43.320 --> 48:49.400]  It's about as globalist and liberal in the central city of San Francisco.
[48:49.400 --> 48:52.880]  And I don't see people down there that are supporting Hillary.
[48:52.880 --> 48:57.400]  A million Terry town, which I cut through sometimes coming to work if there's traffic
[48:57.400 --> 49:03.800]  jams on the highway, then I see Hillary signs all over the place in an area where a four
[49:03.800 --> 49:09.040]  bedroom costs two to $3 million.
[49:09.040 --> 49:13.280]  It's as expensive as New York City.
[49:13.280 --> 49:21.120]  And they're all Democrats and they run the show and they're the ones getting fat off
[49:21.120 --> 49:23.360]  all this, off the special deals.
[49:23.360 --> 49:24.360]  They don't have to produce.
[49:24.360 --> 49:28.520]  They just sell off our industry, sell off our jobs, let foreign banks come in and sell
[49:28.520 --> 49:29.520]  us derivatives.
[49:29.520 --> 49:34.920]  And the Democrats have gotten rid of all the laws, banning loan sharking, where they can
[49:34.920 --> 49:39.160]  charge people 30, 40% interest in a month.
[49:39.160 --> 49:40.320]  It's really shameful.
[49:40.320 --> 49:43.120]  And folks, you know I cut my teeth attacking the Republicans.
[49:43.120 --> 49:44.760]  I hate the Republican establishment.
[49:44.760 --> 49:46.440]  They're against Trump too.
[49:46.440 --> 49:52.000]  But Roger Stone's coming up, we'll take calls in the second half of the interview with him.
[49:52.000 --> 49:56.920]  I want to go to this Donald Trump video and it's the first of many.
[49:56.920 --> 49:59.880]  You know, really the only day off around here is Saturday.
[49:59.880 --> 50:04.960]  We have a couple of reporters that write articles and post stories on Saturday, but that's our
[50:04.960 --> 50:05.960]  dead time.
[50:05.960 --> 50:11.600]  And I call three or four of the camera folks and editors and the fourth guy answered and
[50:11.600 --> 50:15.400]  Rob Jacobson, Greg Guy, I said, Rob, been working here 15 years, I said, will you come
[50:15.400 --> 50:20.040]  in and shoot a video, edited it, I really need to shoot some videos, I need to work.
[50:20.040 --> 50:24.960]  We came up here, we worked about seven hours yesterday.
[50:24.960 --> 50:25.960]  Not on just this, but other things.
[50:25.960 --> 50:29.240]  And I'm not bragging, but I'm saying that's how committed I am.
[50:29.240 --> 50:35.800]  I just can't sit here and watch Google delist Trump online and not even having listed as
[50:35.800 --> 50:42.120]  a presidential candidate and defend it or Twitter blocking or polls being manipulated
[50:42.120 --> 50:50.000]  or the Republican RNC given 40% less airtime than the DNC was given on major networks or
[50:50.000 --> 50:53.600]  the fact that they're going to have two of the three debates now during prime time NFL
[50:53.600 --> 50:57.320]  football games.
[50:57.320 --> 50:59.280]  So that the Republican base doesn't get fired up.
[50:59.280 --> 51:01.360]  I mean, the fix is in.
[51:01.360 --> 51:04.600]  We must vote for Trump as a referendum against fraud.
[51:04.600 --> 51:10.800]  But Trump, remember the media is saying he screwed up, he didn't, you know, he didn't
[51:10.800 --> 51:15.880]  lay down to the delegates, you know, oh, the Republicans passed a rule that delegates
[51:15.880 --> 51:17.880]  matter, not voters, voters never mattered.
[51:17.880 --> 51:25.600]  You silly goose, silly, silly, silly kid, but he didn't go along with it.
[51:25.600 --> 51:30.720]  So it became his greatest asset and that's what Trump's got to do now.
[51:30.720 --> 51:32.280]  I know they're concerned about election fraud.
[51:32.280 --> 51:34.280]  They're aware of it.
[51:34.280 --> 51:37.920]  They don't want to hype it too much as to discourage voters, but no, no, what you can't
[51:37.920 --> 51:39.840]  steal is a landslide.
[51:39.840 --> 51:45.080]  It's been proven they're going to get caught.
[51:45.080 --> 51:47.960]  And Hillary's already engaged in election fraud with the illegals all over the country
[51:47.960 --> 51:52.960]  being given driver's license and Democrats wanting to pass laws in a whole bunch of states.
[51:52.960 --> 51:59.120]  It's like 14 states last time I checked Illinois, California, you name it, Vermont of all places
[51:59.120 --> 52:00.960]  to let illegals vote.
[52:00.960 --> 52:03.760]  Wow, you're not a citizen, but you get to vote.
[52:03.760 --> 52:08.240]  I mean, that is upside down world that she's engaged in all these frauds.
[52:08.240 --> 52:09.240]  She's crooked.
[52:09.240 --> 52:10.480]  We know she's crooked.
[52:10.480 --> 52:14.200]  We know she's corrupt.
[52:14.200 --> 52:16.200]  She's already stolen the election.
[52:16.200 --> 52:21.680]  She's an illegitimate nominee.
[52:21.680 --> 52:27.240]  Trump's got to come out and say, erasing emails, stealing it from Bernie Sanders and then put
[52:27.240 --> 52:32.040]  on the evidence, doing all this, having illegals vote.
[52:32.040 --> 52:35.240]  Americans need to vote for me in a landslide to support free and open elections because
[52:35.240 --> 52:37.200]  she's not an illegitimate nominee.
[52:37.200 --> 52:38.960]  People will call that bad sportsmanship.
[52:38.960 --> 52:41.200]  It's not bad sportsmanship if someone's a fraud.
[52:41.200 --> 52:46.640]  It's the truth and orthodox Republicans are the ones been selling us out to the Democrats
[52:46.640 --> 52:48.960]  and Donald Trump isn't one of those people.
[52:48.960 --> 52:54.640]  And his whole name and psyche and spirit is bound to this.
[52:54.640 --> 53:01.080]  And he knows what he's got to do.
[53:01.080 --> 53:05.480]  So my message is DonaldTrump's on infowars.com.
[53:05.480 --> 53:06.480]  Emergency message.
[53:06.480 --> 53:07.480]  Here it is, folks.
[53:07.480 --> 53:11.080]  Get it, put it out on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, everywhere.
[53:11.080 --> 53:12.080]  Copy it to your channel.
[53:12.080 --> 53:13.200]  Send to their talk show host.
[53:13.200 --> 53:16.320]  Ask them to get involved and investigate.
[53:16.320 --> 53:23.560]  They've got Glenn Beck and Ted Cruz, the Bush operatives telling Texans to don't vote for
[53:23.560 --> 53:26.240]  Trump.
[53:26.240 --> 53:29.520]  And in Texas, they got enough brainwashed people because Ted Cruz wore a cowboy hat to
[53:29.520 --> 53:33.960]  maybe give it to Hillary.
[53:33.960 --> 53:37.400]  Don't let Texas be the Benedict Arnold that helps flit the country's throat.
[53:37.400 --> 53:39.640]  That's just the saddest thing I ever heard of.
[53:39.640 --> 53:44.880]  And if that's the case, I can tell you Texas has been conquered.
[53:44.880 --> 53:48.240]  Is there no end to the treachery?
[53:48.240 --> 53:50.640]  Is there no end to the evil?
[53:50.640 --> 53:53.120]  Here's Donald Trump.
[53:53.120 --> 53:57.120]  Alex Jones here with an extremely important message to Donald Trump, the people of the
[53:57.120 --> 53:58.840]  United States, the people of the world.
[53:58.840 --> 54:02.680]  Crooked Hillary Clinton has openly stolen the nomination of Bernie Sanders.
[54:02.680 --> 54:06.800]  Mr. Trump, I'm not going to lay things out here that you don't already know.
[54:06.800 --> 54:14.000]  But I am going to ask you to seriously think about making the issue of Hillary's election
[54:14.000 --> 54:20.480]  fraud in the primaries one of the central issues to defeating her in November.
[54:20.480 --> 54:26.240]  I have interviewed all the top election fraud experts, whether it's from low-level retail
[54:26.240 --> 54:29.880]  voter fraud or election fraud with the black box voting machines.
[54:29.880 --> 54:31.800]  And the evidence is clear.
[54:31.800 --> 54:36.400]  Only landslides can defeat major election fraud.
[54:36.400 --> 54:41.040]  And as your polls go up and up and up, 7-10 points against Hillary.
[54:41.040 --> 54:45.840]  As people learn how corrupt she is and how corrupt she has been, your numbers are only
[54:45.840 --> 54:47.360]  going to go up.
[54:47.360 --> 54:50.360]  They know you are the real leader.
[54:50.360 --> 54:53.880]  They know you should be the next president of the United States.
[54:53.880 --> 54:55.360]  And they're going to try to block you.
[54:55.360 --> 54:59.920]  When the mainstream media ridiculed Donald Trump and said he was a sore loser, that he
[54:59.920 --> 55:05.680]  shouldn't talk about Ted Cruz canceling elections and having voterless victories in the primaries,
[55:05.680 --> 55:09.800]  yes, it was sensational when he came out and said, I'm winning these states, but they're
[55:09.800 --> 55:11.560]  giving the delegates to Ted Cruz.
[55:11.560 --> 55:17.800]  In some cases, they would just cancel elections in many states and just give him all the delegates.
[55:17.800 --> 55:19.440]  So we have a rigged system.
[55:19.440 --> 55:23.520]  So in Colorado, they were going to vote, and you saw what's happening in Colorado.
[55:23.520 --> 55:25.600]  It's one of the big things.
[55:25.600 --> 55:32.200]  It's a fix because we thought we were having an election, and a number of months ago they
[55:32.200 --> 55:38.640]  decided to do it by, you know what, right, right?
[55:38.640 --> 55:40.280]  They said we'll do it by delegate.
[55:40.280 --> 55:42.800]  They said they're going to do it by delegate.
[55:42.800 --> 55:44.680]  Oh, isn't that nice?
[55:44.680 --> 55:50.680]  And the delegates were all there, all waiting, and the head guy, in fact, one of them tweeted
[55:50.680 --> 55:55.480]  out today or said today by mistake, and then they withdrew it, something to the effect.
[55:55.480 --> 56:01.000]  See, never Trump, look what we did, never Trump, because if I go to the voters of Colorado,
[56:01.000 --> 56:02.480]  we win Colorado.
[56:02.480 --> 56:04.040]  Donald Trump wasn't intimidated.
[56:04.040 --> 56:05.760]  He came out and said, what do you mean?
[56:05.760 --> 56:10.680]  When I win a state, I should win the delegates, and they had to back down.
[56:10.680 --> 56:14.120]  Sanders didn't do that, and Hillary stole it from him.
[56:14.120 --> 56:22.840]  But Bernie Sanders, I will say this, for the last five weeks, you turn on your television.
[56:22.840 --> 56:24.560]  Sanders wins.
[56:24.560 --> 56:25.560]  Sanders wins.
[56:25.560 --> 56:29.640]  Again, Sanders wins, like seven or eight or nine.
[56:29.640 --> 56:35.280]  He keeps winning, and then you listen to the people and the pundits, and they say he has
[56:35.280 --> 56:36.280]  no chance of winning.
[56:36.280 --> 56:37.800]  I said, what's going on?
[56:37.800 --> 56:39.000]  Because you have superdelegates.
[56:39.000 --> 56:43.120]  By the way, I think the Republicans have a worse system than the Democrats, but they
[56:43.120 --> 56:45.040]  have superdelegates.
[56:45.040 --> 56:48.280]  It makes it impossible for a guy that wins to win.
[56:48.280 --> 56:54.800]  It is imperative that the Trump campaign make this one of the central issues, because it
[56:54.800 --> 57:00.640]  only further documents the organized crime nature of Hillary Rodham Clinton and her crime
[57:00.640 --> 57:01.640]  family.
[57:01.640 --> 57:06.520]  If she stole the primary, she's going to try to steal the general election.
[57:06.520 --> 57:09.120]  So Donald Trump's already done the right thing in the primary.
[57:09.120 --> 57:11.920]  He didn't let the voters have their votes stolen.
[57:11.920 --> 57:14.800]  He didn't let himself and his family be robbed as well.
[57:14.800 --> 57:16.520]  He stood up and said no.
[57:16.520 --> 57:21.640]  And so now, Donald Trump needs to really think about what he's going to do.
[57:21.640 --> 57:27.120]  But we have to think about what are we going to do to stop Hillary, who's already stolen
[57:27.120 --> 57:32.120]  the process, who's a fraudulent nominee from stealing the general election.
[57:32.120 --> 57:34.040]  My message to the American people is this.
[57:34.040 --> 57:36.560]  All right, there's a couple more minutes to it.
[57:36.560 --> 57:38.360]  The video's up on infowars.com.
[57:38.360 --> 57:41.040]  My emergency message is Donald Trump.
[57:41.040 --> 57:42.040]  Everybody needs to spread that video.
[57:42.040 --> 57:46.080]  We'll be back with a second hour, Roger Stone, your calls, and a bunch of other geopolitical
[57:46.080 --> 57:47.080]  news as well.
[57:47.080 --> 57:54.080]  Hi, yeah, first of all, I want to say, take the 12-act two, SuperMail, BrainForce, Prostigar,
[57:54.080 --> 57:55.080]  SilverBullet.
[57:55.080 --> 57:56.080]  I use them all.
[57:56.080 --> 57:57.080]  They're phenomenal.
[57:57.080 --> 57:58.080]  They work.
[57:58.080 --> 57:59.080]  Buy info.
[57:59.080 --> 58:00.080]  Thank you, brother.
[58:00.080 --> 58:01.080]  Thank you guys for putting those out there.
[58:01.080 --> 58:06.120]  I am a relatively short-time listener and I'm quite a supporter of your fine, fine
[58:06.120 --> 58:07.120]  products.
[58:07.120 --> 58:08.120]  Welcome to the InfoWar.
[58:08.120 --> 58:13.560]  It's so easy to get these incredible nutraceuticals that support your health and the InfoWar
[58:13.560 --> 58:14.560]  at the same time.
[58:14.560 --> 58:15.560]  I'm a nine-year listener.
[58:15.560 --> 58:18.560]  Buy all the nutraceuticals, CasioFX, Mason, I'm nine-year listener.
[58:18.560 --> 58:19.560]  Right.
[58:19.560 --> 58:20.560]  Let me ask you a question.
[58:20.560 --> 58:21.560]  Have they worked for you?
[58:21.560 --> 58:24.120]  They're the most unbelievable products I've ever had in my life.
[58:24.120 --> 58:25.120]  What products are you taking?
[58:25.120 --> 58:26.120]  Are you taking?
[58:26.120 --> 58:33.120]  Everything from SuperMail to BrainForce to WinterSun, X2, even got a little D&A force.
[58:33.120 --> 58:37.040]  So, and I just free up everything and I just went to Autofill.
[58:37.040 --> 58:42.200]  Visit infowars.com to read the information and research and to see the reviews for yourself.
[58:42.200 --> 58:49.200]  Visit infowarslives.com or call 888-253-3139.
[58:49.200 --> 58:51.000]  Dr. Griff, you developed Living Defense for us.
[58:51.000 --> 58:52.440]  It took you over a year to do it.
[58:52.440 --> 58:54.160]  Why is this so good?
[58:54.160 --> 58:58.840]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[58:58.840 --> 59:03.480]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[59:03.480 --> 59:09.200]  my system, but right now we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's
[59:09.200 --> 59:12.520]  harmful to your body that lives off a host mechanism.
[59:12.520 --> 59:17.640]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[59:17.640 --> 59:18.880]  going on everywhere.
[59:18.880 --> 59:19.880]  These are all parasites.
[59:19.880 --> 59:22.600]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[59:22.600 --> 59:23.840]  You have the neem in there.
[59:23.840 --> 59:26.920]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[59:26.920 --> 59:30.200]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[59:30.200 --> 59:31.200]  All right.
[59:31.200 --> 59:33.400]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[59:33.400 --> 59:34.560]  It just came back in yesterday.
[59:34.560 --> 59:38.400]  Living Defense, infowarslives.com and folks, you can't lose full of stuff that's great
[59:38.400 --> 59:39.400]  for your body.
[59:39.400 --> 59:40.400]  Period.
[59:40.400 --> 59:43.480]  And you support the broadcast, infowarslives.com.
[59:43.480 --> 59:45.720]  Thank you, Dr. Grief, from the Global Healing Center.
[59:45.720 --> 59:52.840]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[59:52.840 --> 59:56.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[59:56.840 --> 1:00:18.840]  Yeah, Henry can run on for a long time, for a long time, for a long time, for a long time,
[1:00:18.840 --> 1:00:27.060]  for a long time, soon our laser gun will not engage in fake behavior.
[1:00:27.060 --> 1:00:29.560]  He says he's a Christian, but I think he should invoke God.
[1:00:29.560 --> 1:00:36.200]  He really should invoke Providence and he'll be taken across.
[1:00:36.200 --> 1:00:42.000]  But like Moses at the Red Sea, he's got a call for God's help.
[1:00:42.000 --> 1:00:49.480]  And that's really the final message I have here for Trump.
[1:00:49.480 --> 1:00:58.000]  All right, Roger Stone's going to be joining us coming up in the next segment.
[1:00:58.000 --> 1:01:04.560]  I'm going to open the phones up for your questions to Roger Stone about Campaign 2016.
[1:01:04.560 --> 1:01:11.480]  Globally there's revolt going on against globalism, against offshore mega banks controlling countries,
[1:01:11.480 --> 1:01:16.280]  not elected groups controlling people doing bail ins, taking money directly from nations
[1:01:16.280 --> 1:01:19.760]  and giving it to private corporations that are tax exempt.
[1:01:19.760 --> 1:01:24.840]  But the Pope comes out and the Associated Press reported on it in a speech in Krakow,
[1:01:24.840 --> 1:01:32.080]  Poland, and says we must transcend and refuse to see borders as barriers.
[1:01:32.080 --> 1:01:36.360]  So global government, that means just open yourself up, let yourself be run by the global
[1:01:36.360 --> 1:01:41.080]  authority that runs the global crises.
[1:01:41.080 --> 1:01:45.400]  But I wanted to play this clip, it's part of a speech, and then there's a response to
[1:01:45.400 --> 1:01:46.400]  it.
[1:01:46.400 --> 1:01:57.080]  How do you pronounce this, K-H-I-Z-R, KERS-KON, KASER-KON, the qualities of a leader.
[1:01:57.080 --> 1:02:03.920]  And he goes on to describe Trump as having no soul.
[1:02:03.920 --> 1:02:06.440]  In fact, we have a couple of these different clips.
[1:02:06.440 --> 1:02:12.080]  And then there he is with his wife, who's wearing a jib, a partial one.
[1:02:12.080 --> 1:02:15.680]  I mean, in a lot of Muslim countries they'll murder a woman if she's out without that or
[1:02:15.680 --> 1:02:17.560]  blow up their house or put her in prison.
[1:02:17.560 --> 1:02:27.200]  So that just gets into Islam, like here she is, okay, covering her head up partially.
[1:02:27.200 --> 1:02:31.000]  But the point is, is that women were seen as property, were basically hooded, and Saudi
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:32.440]  Arabia pitched the whole thing.
[1:02:32.440 --> 1:02:38.200]  So I'm just sick of Islamics lecturing me about how they're virtuous and all the social
[1:02:38.200 --> 1:02:43.040]  justice warriors telling me how they're the most advanced group in the world when you've
[1:02:43.040 --> 1:02:50.280]  got what is orthodox Sunni Islam taken over the world that literally keeps women as slaves.
[1:02:50.280 --> 1:02:53.080]  Let's go ahead and play part of the clip of him talking, here it is.
[1:02:53.080 --> 1:03:02.880]  Patriotic American Muslims with undivided loyalty to our country.
[1:03:02.880 --> 1:03:10.520]  Well, of course, there are people that are undivided, they're seen as heritage by Islamists.
[1:03:10.520 --> 1:03:15.080]  We came to this country empty-handed, and of course his son died.
[1:03:15.080 --> 1:03:19.800]  We believed in American democracy, in Iraq, fighting the non-radical Muslim, that with
[1:03:19.800 --> 1:03:25.720]  hard work and goodness of this country.
[1:03:25.720 --> 1:03:33.040]  We could share in and contribute to its blessings.
[1:03:33.040 --> 1:03:45.400]  We are blessed to raise our three sons in a nation where they were free to be destroyed.
[1:03:45.400 --> 1:03:47.720]  In fact, I'll give that the name, that's enough of him.
[1:03:47.720 --> 1:03:50.840]  I'll actually say this guy's better than Democrats, at least he thanks God.
[1:03:50.840 --> 1:03:52.680]  In fact, I'll give it to the Muslims.
[1:03:52.680 --> 1:03:55.400]  I'm not some Muslim, everybody knows I was against the Iraq war.
[1:03:55.400 --> 1:03:59.400]  I was against the clashes of civilizations, because I knew Saudi Arabia was involved in
[1:03:59.400 --> 1:04:04.640]  it to take over, and they're the absolute out of control group.
[1:04:04.640 --> 1:04:07.960]  Democrats support this whole takeover in Syria and in murdering Christians.
[1:04:07.960 --> 1:04:08.960]  What about us?
[1:04:08.960 --> 1:04:11.600]  We have value too, not just you.
[1:04:11.600 --> 1:04:12.600]  That's what I don't like.
[1:04:12.600 --> 1:04:18.240]  Let's play Khan though, when he talks about Donald Trump as a black soul, it's a short
[1:04:18.240 --> 1:04:19.240]  clip.
[1:04:19.240 --> 1:04:26.400]  Two things are absolutely necessary in any leader, or any person that aspires, wishes
[1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:34.560]  to be a leader, that is model compass, and second is empathy.
[1:04:34.560 --> 1:04:38.640]  Hillary Clinton went into a non-radical Muslim country, overthrew it, put al-Qaeda in, hundreds
[1:04:38.640 --> 1:04:40.600]  of thousands died, Libya.
[1:04:40.600 --> 1:04:42.760]  She says, I came, I saw, he died.
[1:04:42.760 --> 1:04:44.840]  How that high you know laugh.
[1:04:44.840 --> 1:04:47.840]  I mean, did you talk about Hillary with no compass?
[1:04:47.840 --> 1:04:50.600]  I mean, you know, ask this guy.
[1:04:50.600 --> 1:04:54.120]  Under Islam, how many girlfriends can Hillary have?
[1:04:54.120 --> 1:04:55.120]  I'm just saying.
[1:04:55.120 --> 1:04:59.320]  They'll be back with Roger Stone, infowars.com.
[1:04:59.320 --> 1:05:11.920]  I've been working all day, I took a couple hours off, coaching basketball, I get in
[1:05:11.920 --> 1:05:16.280]  here at 8.30, I was kind of run down, you know, I just didn't feel like I was going
[1:05:16.280 --> 1:05:17.280]  to make it.
[1:05:17.280 --> 1:05:20.200]  And I really wanted to do a good job on the interview, I got my bottle of brain force
[1:05:20.200 --> 1:05:24.200]  right there, I popped two of them, and about 20 minutes later, it's like, bing, everything
[1:05:24.200 --> 1:05:25.800]  just kind of clears up.
[1:05:25.800 --> 1:05:30.400]  It's got four and a half stars, people really love it, read about it, find out why third
[1:05:30.400 --> 1:05:35.120]  party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best
[1:05:35.120 --> 1:05:38.560]  organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[1:05:38.560 --> 1:05:41.520]  I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while, but I probably could not have done
[1:05:41.520 --> 1:05:42.520]  it without brain force.
[1:05:42.520 --> 1:05:47.480]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brain
[1:05:47.480 --> 1:05:48.840]  force and came in.
[1:05:48.840 --> 1:05:55.840]  You will find brain force and other game changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.
[1:06:18.840 --> 1:06:35.840]  So, the new fake controversy is how horrible and evil Donald Trump is for saying, why is
[1:06:35.840 --> 1:06:42.360]  this Muslim guy on the DNC criticizing me last week, and his wife's up there not talking,
[1:06:42.360 --> 1:06:43.360]  it's weird.
[1:06:43.360 --> 1:06:47.880]  I mean, when Donald Trump brings a woman up on stage or anybody else, he hasn't talked.
[1:06:47.880 --> 1:06:48.880]  I mean, it is weird.
[1:06:48.880 --> 1:06:55.040]  And they say, oh, she just can't evolve the trauma of her son that died in Iraq or whatever.
[1:06:55.040 --> 1:07:00.240]  The point is, is that in orthodox Islamic countries, the women can't even drive cars
[1:07:00.240 --> 1:07:03.960]  and wears bags over their heads, is what Donald Trump is saying.
[1:07:03.960 --> 1:07:09.720]  Meanwhile, this guy is coming out saying Donald Trump has a black soul.
[1:07:09.720 --> 1:07:13.320]  Well, I wish this guy would say that about ISIS.
[1:07:13.320 --> 1:07:17.880]  So here's this Khazir Khan on the Clinton News Network.
[1:07:17.880 --> 1:07:22.700]  I want his family to counsel him, teach him some empathy.
[1:07:22.700 --> 1:07:29.160]  He will be a better person if he could become, but he is a black soul.
[1:07:29.160 --> 1:07:34.720]  And this is totally unfit for the leadership of this beautiful country, the love and affection
[1:07:34.720 --> 1:07:35.720]  that we have.
[1:07:35.720 --> 1:07:36.720]  Oh, yes.
[1:07:36.720 --> 1:07:43.480]  Our beliefs, our experience in this country had been correct and positive.
[1:07:43.480 --> 1:07:48.080]  The world is receiving us like we have never seen.
[1:07:48.080 --> 1:07:57.480]  Oh, they have seen the blackness of his character, of his soul, that he is wide of recognizing
[1:07:57.480 --> 1:08:00.680]  empathizing with people.
[1:08:00.680 --> 1:08:01.680]  That's right.
[1:08:01.680 --> 1:08:03.240]  It's Donald Trump.
[1:08:03.240 --> 1:08:08.280]  The world is receiving the 5 million Islamists into Europe, 80% militarized men, and the
[1:08:08.280 --> 1:08:10.720]  million, I mean, they claim a couple thousand.
[1:08:10.720 --> 1:08:17.120]  It's thousands in every major school in Austin, hundreds per high school.
[1:08:17.120 --> 1:08:21.440]  And then down to the grades, thousands of just children.
[1:08:21.440 --> 1:08:24.400]  We've gone with reporters, they admit it.
[1:08:24.400 --> 1:08:26.200]  They've covered that up just like in Europe.
[1:08:26.200 --> 1:08:31.160]  Two years ago, they said it was 100,000, and now they go, it's 5 million.
[1:08:31.160 --> 1:08:35.400]  And they're bringing them in from Wahhabist countries, 0.3% of Christians, because they're
[1:08:35.400 --> 1:08:48.720]  being exterminated all over the Middle East, 20% is what Syria was, 20%, 20%, 20%.
[1:08:48.720 --> 1:08:55.360]  And you think about this, they bring 0.3% and according to the Congressional report,
[1:08:55.360 --> 1:08:59.160]  it's been the Associated Press, they won't let Christians in, they've sent people in
[1:08:59.160 --> 1:09:04.520]  to kill them, and he goes, everyone is receiving us like never before, because they see through
[1:09:04.520 --> 1:09:06.000]  the Trump evil.
[1:09:06.000 --> 1:09:09.000]  Yeah, he cut off the priest's head and killed the nuns last week.
[1:09:09.000 --> 1:09:14.240]  He drove the truck over, body and knees, he attacks every day in Germany, bombing, shootings,
[1:09:14.240 --> 1:09:21.400]  and when Islamists gets blown up, they say a poor man got blown up, a Syrian refugee,
[1:09:21.400 --> 1:09:25.920]  when he blows himself up, it's about how he died.
[1:09:25.920 --> 1:09:31.680]  And when his name's Ali, his name becomes David in the BBC.
[1:09:31.680 --> 1:09:37.000]  And Donald Trump isn't even listed on Google as a presidential candidate.
[1:09:37.000 --> 1:09:41.640]  And now they're gonna put the debates on during football games, NFL, everything they can to
[1:09:41.640 --> 1:09:42.640]  fix it.
[1:09:42.640 --> 1:09:48.080]  And to me, for Trump, he's been doing it, but I dribbled down.
[1:09:48.080 --> 1:09:53.360]  The whole issue is the Republican establishment, the Democratic establishment, the corrupt
[1:09:53.360 --> 1:09:58.000]  pope, the communist Chinese, the Saudi Arabian government, the Mexican president, all these
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:10:02.560]  foreign corrupt leaders tell us we can't have Donald Trump and misrepresent who he is and
[1:10:02.560 --> 1:10:03.560]  what he stands for.
[1:10:03.560 --> 1:10:07.800]  And then Hillary steals the nomination from Bernie Sanders, who clearly won, that's admitted.
[1:10:07.800 --> 1:10:13.400]  Even in liberal publications like New York Daily News, you point out she stole the election,
[1:10:13.400 --> 1:10:15.600]  she's not even a legitimate nominee.
[1:10:15.600 --> 1:10:19.840]  You say fine though, you're the nominee, but it's a referendum of a landslide, because
[1:10:19.840 --> 1:10:22.880]  I've interviewed all the experts, you can't stop a landslide.
[1:10:22.880 --> 1:10:28.720]  Now Roger Stone and former Trump campaign head worked on nine campaigns, been inside
[1:10:28.720 --> 1:10:30.680]  three or four administrations.
[1:10:30.680 --> 1:10:31.840]  He joins us right now.
[1:10:31.840 --> 1:10:37.040]  He's an election fraud expert, and we're gonna spend the rest of the hour on this and take
[1:10:37.040 --> 1:10:39.680]  your phone calls, rogerstoneofstonesome.com.
[1:10:39.680 --> 1:10:46.400]  I should add, by the way, just briefly that nobody else has got the courage to distribute
[1:10:46.400 --> 1:10:49.120]  and manufacture the Bill Clinton rape shirts while I do.
[1:10:49.120 --> 1:10:51.880]  And it's not because I think I'm gonna get out of this, by the way, it's what it's up
[1:10:51.880 --> 1:10:55.200]  to God, between God and the hit teams, Hillary's God.
[1:10:55.200 --> 1:10:56.760]  They've been killing a lot of folks.
[1:10:56.760 --> 1:11:00.320]  But bottom line here, ladies and gentlemen, we're putting out the Bill Clinton rape shirt,
[1:11:00.320 --> 1:11:04.440]  looks like the Bill Clinton hope shirt, and it's incredible.
[1:11:04.440 --> 1:11:08.360]  It's selling more now than the Hillary for Prison shirt in the last week.
[1:11:08.360 --> 1:11:16.160]  I'm very excited, and it's on sale today, 20% off, $15.96, and the meager profit we make.
[1:11:16.160 --> 1:11:21.040]  Funds this operation, a little bit of money to Stone to run what he's doing, infowarstore.com.
[1:11:21.040 --> 1:11:25.760]  The epic battle for the Republic, we've got 40% off on many other items that ends today
[1:11:25.760 --> 1:11:26.760]  infowarstore.com.
[1:11:26.760 --> 1:11:30.680]  But congratulations, you've got the new mega viral shirt, rogerstone.
[1:11:30.680 --> 1:11:36.760]  Yeah, Time Magazine actually kind of, in an attempt to ridicule the shirt, only elevated
[1:11:36.760 --> 1:11:37.760]  public interest.
[1:11:37.760 --> 1:11:38.760]  And the Guardian.
[1:11:38.760 --> 1:11:39.760]  And the Guardian.
[1:11:39.760 --> 1:11:41.960]  Look, it is a key issue in this campaign.
[1:11:41.960 --> 1:11:49.040]  Hillary masquerades as an advocate for women, but her husband is a sexual creditor and he's
[1:11:49.040 --> 1:11:54.000]  attacked multiple credible women, raped, assaulted, exposed himself while around.
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:55.000]  Settled cases.
[1:11:55.000 --> 1:11:59.680]  Settled, at least one large case that we know of, for almost a million dollars.
[1:11:59.680 --> 1:12:04.240]  Now, the Clint Nikes say, well, that's Bill, it has nothing to do with Hillary, it has
[1:12:04.240 --> 1:12:10.600]  everything to do with Hillary, because she directs the campaign to discredit, and intimidate,
[1:12:10.600 --> 1:12:16.400]  and threaten, and as the left likes to say, bully, builds victims into silence.
[1:12:16.400 --> 1:12:23.320]  And that is entirely documented in the Clinton's War on Women, which I'm also selling through
[1:12:23.320 --> 1:12:27.320]  infowarstore.
[1:12:27.320 --> 1:12:33.800]  This is the definitive expose on Bill and Hillary, but it's much, much more than sexual
[1:12:33.800 --> 1:12:36.360]  assault and cover-up, as you will see.
[1:12:36.360 --> 1:12:42.480]  So to move on, this T-shirt, I think, continues to put it front and center.
[1:12:42.480 --> 1:12:50.880]  The New York Post today has a, published a set of photographs of Melania Trump.
[1:12:50.880 --> 1:12:54.960]  Before the Trumps were married, when she was single, I don't think they knew each other
[1:12:54.960 --> 1:12:57.200]  at this period of time.
[1:12:57.200 --> 1:12:59.200]  You know how she looks?
[1:12:59.200 --> 1:13:00.200]  Amazing.
[1:13:00.200 --> 1:13:02.800]  Bill Clinton is a sexual creditor.
[1:13:02.800 --> 1:13:04.600]  They're trying to distract us with this.
[1:13:04.600 --> 1:13:05.600]  Yeah, so what?
[1:13:05.600 --> 1:13:07.600]  Donald Trump got a really hot wife.
[1:13:07.600 --> 1:13:08.600]  Great.
[1:13:08.600 --> 1:13:09.600]  Exactly.
[1:13:09.600 --> 1:13:10.600]  So it is- I'm blessing, I'm admiring.
[1:13:10.600 --> 1:13:14.520]  I mean, Eastern European women, I gotta say, are about as hot as it gets.
[1:13:14.520 --> 1:13:18.960]  Well, if they want to talk about sex, we have to talk about Bill Clinton and Hillary's
[1:13:18.960 --> 1:13:20.800]  wall as an accessory in his sex fight.
[1:13:20.800 --> 1:13:21.800]  I gotta be honest.
[1:13:21.800 --> 1:13:22.800]  They're Mexican TV stars.
[1:13:22.800 --> 1:13:23.800]  I'm sorry.
[1:13:23.800 --> 1:13:28.480]  Times have already demonstrated they want to talk about Donald Trump and sex and his
[1:13:28.480 --> 1:13:29.480]  past.
[1:13:29.480 --> 1:13:32.240]  So I mean, it is a fair game, I would say.
[1:13:32.240 --> 1:13:33.240]  But he's so evil.
[1:13:33.240 --> 1:13:37.000]  It said he would spoil women when he was divorced and had girlfriends and would actually ask
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:39.520]  women out at cocktail parties.
[1:13:39.520 --> 1:13:41.120]  This is horrible, Roger.
[1:13:41.120 --> 1:13:44.960]  He would lavish women and treat them wonderful and give them fur coats.
[1:13:44.960 --> 1:13:46.160]  This is an horrible person.
[1:13:46.160 --> 1:13:48.320]  But let's go back to the big picture here.
[1:13:48.320 --> 1:13:52.840]  The only thing Hillary Clinton's got going for her is the mainstream media.
[1:13:52.840 --> 1:13:58.880]  And at this point, I'm sure a detailed plan on how to steal this election, they're petrified
[1:13:58.880 --> 1:14:01.120]  about the election of Donald Trump.
[1:14:01.120 --> 1:14:05.840]  They've announced that they're going to pursue essentially a buried goldwater strategy.
[1:14:05.840 --> 1:14:08.920]  They're going to say he's mentally unstable.
[1:14:08.920 --> 1:14:09.920]  He's a dummy.
[1:14:09.920 --> 1:14:10.920]  He's a crook.
[1:14:10.920 --> 1:14:13.920]  He's in bed with Putin.
[1:14:13.920 --> 1:14:20.000]  Some amazing reverse McCarthyism considering that Trump has never met Putin.
[1:14:20.000 --> 1:14:24.360]  But Putin knows Hillary well and he knows she's a liar who will not keep her word.
[1:14:24.360 --> 1:14:27.360]  And he knows she's a neocon in a rush to war.
[1:14:27.360 --> 1:14:32.640]  So yeah, he's taken the measure of both candidates and he prefers Trump.
[1:14:32.640 --> 1:14:41.080]  It's Trump that he could do a Reagan-Gorbyshoff-type peace agreement with to prevent war.
[1:14:41.080 --> 1:14:43.720]  It was somebody who keeps his word, Donald Trump.
[1:14:43.720 --> 1:14:47.400]  Well, I tell you, it is just amazing.
[1:14:47.400 --> 1:14:50.800]  Look, the New York Post, I know, is kind of Republican, but they've been pro-Trump for
[1:14:50.800 --> 1:14:51.800]  a certain extent.
[1:14:51.800 --> 1:14:53.160]  But I know that it's owned by Rupert Murdoch.
[1:14:53.160 --> 1:14:54.720]  There's been a coup there.
[1:14:54.720 --> 1:14:58.360]  Is this publishing photos of his naked wife, which I only admire anymore now?
[1:14:58.360 --> 1:15:00.320]  Well, frankly, I mean, thank God made this.
[1:15:00.320 --> 1:15:01.320]  This is God's creation.
[1:15:01.320 --> 1:15:02.320]  This is the work of art here.
[1:15:02.320 --> 1:15:05.000]  A little too skinny for me, but she's still super hot.
[1:15:05.000 --> 1:15:07.200]  I mean, what is the issue here?
[1:15:07.200 --> 1:15:08.680]  Why are they doing this?
[1:15:08.680 --> 1:15:14.640]  Yeah, because it's circulation and let's face it, I mean, they're great photos, but
[1:15:14.640 --> 1:15:16.760]  they're not nude photos.
[1:15:16.760 --> 1:15:17.760]  This isn't porn.
[1:15:17.760 --> 1:15:18.760]  It's art.
[1:15:18.760 --> 1:15:23.320]  I mean, if you go to Roma Grace, there's like sculptures of naked women.
[1:15:23.320 --> 1:15:24.680]  Well, this should be clear.
[1:15:24.680 --> 1:15:25.680]  You can see her breasts.
[1:15:25.680 --> 1:15:27.920]  You cannot see her genitals.
[1:15:27.920 --> 1:15:28.920]  They are hidden.
[1:15:28.920 --> 1:15:29.920]  They're quite tasteful.
[1:15:29.920 --> 1:15:30.920]  Unfortunately.
[1:15:30.920 --> 1:15:31.920]  What's the point?
[1:15:31.920 --> 1:15:32.920]  She looks great.
[1:15:32.920 --> 1:15:37.400]  The New York Post, I don't think is doing this as a part of a political agenda.
[1:15:37.400 --> 1:15:39.840]  Oh, we got to have this as a first lady.
[1:15:39.840 --> 1:15:42.160]  Oh, my God, compared to that troll we got right now.
[1:15:42.160 --> 1:15:47.240]  Look, she's the most beautiful and glamorous first lady she would be since Jacqueline Kennedy.
[1:15:47.240 --> 1:15:51.280]  Well, I mean, I got a chance to see her in person at the RNC and in person, she has a
[1:15:51.280 --> 1:15:52.280]  presence.
[1:15:52.280 --> 1:15:53.440]  I was like, is that a goddess or something?
[1:15:53.440 --> 1:15:54.440]  Well, but Bill would be first lady.
[1:15:54.440 --> 1:15:55.440]  Stay right there.
[1:15:55.440 --> 1:15:57.440]  We got to go to break, Roger.
[1:15:57.440 --> 1:16:03.600]  A clean, toxic free body is the foundation of true health deep cleanse by infowarslife.com,

[1:17:03.640 --> 1:17:06.880]  I guess like 20 plus hours, tell us what brainforce did.
[1:17:06.880 --> 1:17:11.200]  I've been working all day, I took a couple hours off coaching basketball, I get in here
[1:17:11.200 --> 1:17:15.560]  at 8.30, I was kind of run down, you know, I just didn't feel like I was gonna make it
[1:17:15.560 --> 1:17:19.120]  and I really wanted to do a good job on the interview, I got my bottle of brainforce right
[1:17:19.120 --> 1:17:23.160]  there and popped two of them and about 20 minutes later it's like bing, everything just
[1:17:23.160 --> 1:17:24.560]  kind of clears up.
[1:17:24.560 --> 1:17:29.120]  It's got four and a half stars, people really love it, read about it, find out why third
[1:17:29.120 --> 1:17:33.880]  party nutraceutical sites give it such high praise because it really does have the best
[1:17:33.880 --> 1:17:37.320]  organic based systems that will blow your socks off.
[1:17:37.320 --> 1:17:40.280]  I haven't pulled an all nighter like that in a while but I probably could not have done
[1:17:40.280 --> 1:17:41.280]  it without brainforce.
[1:17:41.280 --> 1:17:46.560]  I went home about 6.45 this morning, took three hours of sleep, got up, took two more brainforce
[1:17:46.560 --> 1:17:47.600]  and came in.
[1:17:47.600 --> 1:17:56.040]  You will find brainforce and other game changing products at infowarslife.com or call 888-253-3139.

[1:20:02.360 --> 1:20:26.640]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:20:26.640 --> 1:20:32.960]  Alright, finishing up with the homilanean Trump situation.
[1:20:32.960 --> 1:20:35.480]  The point is, you want a powerful woman.
[1:20:35.480 --> 1:20:38.560]  The left says powerful women shouldn't use their sexuality.
[1:20:38.560 --> 1:20:44.120]  I see this as art, so putting bookends on it, and I was looking at it during the break,
[1:20:44.120 --> 1:20:47.600]  I didn't know it was a scandal, but they are making it a scandal that his wife was a super
[1:20:47.600 --> 1:20:53.960]  model before he met him and that she posed in tasteful photos with her genitals covered.
[1:20:53.960 --> 1:20:57.520]  I mean, you've got to pull down the art in Europe if you do that, so for TV viewers,
[1:20:57.520 --> 1:21:00.960]  I'll put the New York Post article back up on screen, it's a milanean Trump like you've
[1:21:00.960 --> 1:21:06.000]  never seen her before, and I don't think this hurts Trump because he hasn't posed
[1:21:06.000 --> 1:21:11.480]  as some, you know, fake, super ultra right-wing, you know, Pharisee.
[1:21:11.480 --> 1:21:16.680]  He's a libertine, at least to a certain extent, but I want to segue into election fraud and
[1:21:16.680 --> 1:21:18.480]  where Roger Stone sees all this going.
[1:21:18.480 --> 1:21:21.560]  I talked to you, Roger, at length the last two days about this.
[1:21:21.560 --> 1:21:27.000]  I don't want to speak for you, but obviously, Trump was smart to come out and say, hey,
[1:21:27.000 --> 1:21:30.560]  Ted Cruz is robbing me, the media said, oh, how dare you, the delegates are allowed to
[1:21:30.560 --> 1:21:31.560]  ignore you.
[1:21:31.560 --> 1:21:35.640]  He said it was a fraud, the people said it was a fraud, we rallied, they had to back
[1:21:35.640 --> 1:21:36.640]  off.
[1:21:36.640 --> 1:21:41.680]  Sanders didn't, he had it stolen from him, so if she's already stole the nomination,
[1:21:41.680 --> 1:21:45.800]  I think he just points out we have a fraudulent nominee here, and this should be a referendum,
[1:21:45.800 --> 1:21:50.200]  and he should reach out really hardcore to the Sanders supporters as you've been doing
[1:21:50.200 --> 1:21:52.840]  for really a year seeing this coming.
[1:21:52.840 --> 1:21:54.080]  You've got the floor, Roger Stone.
[1:21:54.080 --> 1:21:56.800]  Yeah, Alex, I agree with your analysis.
[1:21:56.800 --> 1:22:01.800]  I mean, if you're a true progressive, you can't possibly vote for Hillary Clinton.
[1:22:01.800 --> 1:22:06.080]  She's a, she's a crony capitalist and a neocon.
[1:22:06.080 --> 1:22:11.400]  She wants to rush off to the next floor, hopefully her financial backers think with
[1:22:11.400 --> 1:22:16.640]  Russia, and she's, has a terrible record on civil rights.
[1:22:16.640 --> 1:22:21.520]  She's done nothing for black people other than help incarcerate record numbers of them
[1:22:21.520 --> 1:22:24.280]  for nonviolent crimes.
[1:22:24.280 --> 1:22:30.400]  In Bill Clinton's 1994 crime bill, which has destroyed an entire generation of young
[1:22:30.400 --> 1:22:37.520]  African-American men, this was because Dick Morris and Hillary Clinton convinced Bill
[1:22:37.520 --> 1:22:44.240]  that he needed this rightward shift to get reelected, so this is part of his legacy.
[1:22:44.240 --> 1:22:50.000]  This is what we're dealing with, so I think she can be defeated.
[1:22:50.000 --> 1:22:54.760]  I am convinced that they are looking more and more at the option of stealing it.
[1:22:54.760 --> 1:22:56.880]  This isn't going their way.
[1:22:56.880 --> 1:23:04.360]  The fact that the Russians will, or whoever, it was going to continue to drop truth bombs
[1:23:04.360 --> 1:23:07.720]  on the American people in the form of their own documents.
[1:23:07.720 --> 1:23:10.200]  Alex, these are like the Watergate tapes.
[1:23:10.200 --> 1:23:14.560]  The Clintons have cut their own throat because they assume that no one would ever see all
[1:23:14.560 --> 1:23:18.200]  of their secret illegal maneuverings.
[1:23:18.200 --> 1:23:24.920]  This is why they use the unsecured server to hide the very things that I suspect someone,
[1:23:24.920 --> 1:23:30.800]  most likely the Russians, is going to drop on the American people like truth bombs throughout
[1:23:30.800 --> 1:23:32.000]  this election.
[1:23:32.000 --> 1:23:35.760]  She could raise a billion dollars, and it may not matter.
[1:23:35.760 --> 1:23:42.360]  Trump may beat her like a drum as he pounces on and helps further public knowledge of
[1:23:42.360 --> 1:23:45.960]  every one of the bombshells that is coming.
[1:23:45.960 --> 1:23:48.080]  This is get ready and strap in your seat belt.
[1:23:48.080 --> 1:23:52.040]  I was about to say he came out as you know and said, I'm taking the gloves off, which
[1:23:52.040 --> 1:23:56.800]  means he's leaning more towards our camp, and very, very exciting.
[1:23:56.800 --> 1:24:01.760]  We've got Reuters going back in polls that Trump was winning and changing them directly
[1:24:01.760 --> 1:24:05.440]  out of 1984 with the memory hole or the Soviet Union.
[1:24:05.440 --> 1:24:07.480]  We've got Google delisting him.
[1:24:07.480 --> 1:24:09.480]  They are pulling out the stops, Roger.
[1:24:09.480 --> 1:24:17.920]  Well, when I met in Cleveland with Nigel Farage, he gave me a number of very salient observations
[1:24:17.920 --> 1:24:25.440]  and tips about how to reach blue collar voters, working class voters, union member voters.
[1:24:25.440 --> 1:24:29.120]  That's the founder and a former leader of UKIP that had the British exit.
[1:24:29.120 --> 1:24:30.120]  Exactly.
[1:24:30.120 --> 1:24:34.560]  The man who orchestrated that blow against globalism in the Brexit vote.
[1:24:34.560 --> 1:24:37.840]  I think Donald Trump knows how to ring these chimes.
[1:24:37.840 --> 1:24:42.080]  In other words, I think he is going to make real inroads.
[1:24:42.080 --> 1:24:47.120]  These are precisely the kind of voters who are not offended by the photos of Mulanian
[1:24:47.120 --> 1:24:48.120]  Trump.
[1:24:48.120 --> 1:24:51.600]  In fact, they probably like them, at least the men.
[1:24:51.600 --> 1:24:57.880]  Secondarily, these are the people who I think are already disliked and distrust Hillary
[1:24:57.880 --> 1:24:58.880]  Clinton.
[1:24:58.880 --> 1:25:02.640]  I think they're going to be key voters in this block.
[1:25:02.640 --> 1:25:11.320]  The pollsters are going to show her ahead and try to create a sense of hopelessness
[1:25:11.320 --> 1:25:12.320]  about Trump.
[1:25:12.320 --> 1:25:13.320]  Sure, that's it.
[1:25:13.320 --> 1:25:14.320]  It's all about a fake perception.
[1:25:14.320 --> 1:25:15.320]  Right.
[1:25:15.320 --> 1:25:16.320]  So they're just going to put out fake polls.
[1:25:16.320 --> 1:25:17.880]  So how do we counter that?
[1:25:17.880 --> 1:25:22.000]  Well, to say you don't believe them, constantly say you don't believe them, Trump will denounce
[1:25:22.000 --> 1:25:25.360]  polls, as you know, when they are bogus and rigged.
[1:25:25.360 --> 1:25:27.440]  Well, what about this unprecedented move?
[1:25:27.440 --> 1:25:32.400]  I've got the article right here where even mainline pollsters are saying this is, quote,
[1:25:32.400 --> 1:25:38.120]  malprofessional malpractice of Reuters to go back in time and change polls and then
[1:25:38.120 --> 1:25:41.160]  just give Hillary all of the undecided people.
[1:25:41.160 --> 1:25:43.520]  I mean, this is just, this is total rigging nakedly.
[1:25:43.520 --> 1:25:48.720]  Well, and the other thing that we have discussed is the fact that we have noticed a discrepancy
[1:25:48.720 --> 1:25:56.040]  between polls that use a live, a questioner, and polls that are automated where you use
[1:25:56.040 --> 1:25:59.120]  your keypad on the phone like a computer.
[1:25:59.120 --> 1:26:03.680]  Push one for Trump, push two for Clinton, push three for undecided.
[1:26:03.680 --> 1:26:07.280]  Trump always runs three to five points better in the latter.
[1:26:07.280 --> 1:26:09.080]  There is a hidden vote for Donald Trump.
[1:26:09.080 --> 1:26:11.320]  It's not going to show up in any poll.
[1:26:11.320 --> 1:26:17.240]  If you are a middle class voter and you get a call from someone you don't know, saying
[1:26:17.240 --> 1:26:18.240]  who are you voting for?
[1:26:18.240 --> 1:26:21.480]  You're not going to tell them because you don't want people to know.
[1:26:21.480 --> 1:26:22.480]  Absolutely.
[1:26:22.480 --> 1:26:29.040]  I want to ask you the $64 trillion or Zagillion dollar question, Roger Stone.
[1:26:29.040 --> 1:26:33.120]  Every liberal I talk to says they're voting third party or they're voting for Trump because
[1:26:33.120 --> 1:26:34.480]  Hillary stole it.
[1:26:34.480 --> 1:26:35.560]  We have real trouble.
[1:26:35.560 --> 1:26:37.560]  This isn't hyperbole.
[1:26:37.560 --> 1:26:40.600]  All over the country, even in Democrat areas, finding people that support Hillary.
[1:26:40.600 --> 1:26:44.240]  Now, I go through super elite areas, yeah, there's some Hillary signs, but that's it.
[1:26:44.240 --> 1:26:45.800]  Like Terry Town here in Austin.
[1:26:45.800 --> 1:26:50.040]  So it looks like everybody's just been beaten over the head and is scared but won't say
[1:26:50.040 --> 1:26:51.040]  they're voting for Trump.
[1:26:51.040 --> 1:26:55.720]  But I think there's a massive, I know there's a massive closeted Trump voter percentage.
[1:26:55.720 --> 1:26:56.720]  What do you think?
[1:26:56.720 --> 1:27:01.840]  You know, five to seven points depending on the state, much closer than others, but it's
[1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:02.840]  out there.
[1:27:02.840 --> 1:27:10.240]  It's a factor, Jill Stein fighting into Hillary, particularly given new life by the revelations
[1:27:10.240 --> 1:27:13.440]  that they screwed Bernie.
[1:27:13.440 --> 1:27:19.280]  I mean, Debbie Wasserman Schultz didn't even use the Vaseline and then she's immediately
[1:27:19.280 --> 1:27:20.280]  rewarded.
[1:27:20.280 --> 1:27:23.160]  That's how brazen the Clintons are.
[1:27:23.160 --> 1:27:26.680]  You know, I think Sanders put up a valiant race.
[1:27:26.680 --> 1:27:29.720]  I would hit Hillary on some slightly different issues that he did.
[1:27:29.720 --> 1:27:30.720]  Sure.
[1:27:30.720 --> 1:27:34.080]  So obviously we reach out, I mean, Trump continues to reach out and say, look, you got
[1:27:34.080 --> 1:27:36.880]  frotted, you got ripped off vote for me.
[1:27:36.880 --> 1:27:40.360]  Yes, there is no question.
[1:27:40.360 --> 1:27:44.280]  So I think that the point here is an obvious one.
[1:27:44.280 --> 1:27:47.880]  If they'll steal it from Bernie, they'll try to steal it from Trump.
[1:27:47.880 --> 1:27:49.760]  And where will the stealing occur?
[1:27:49.760 --> 1:27:53.480]  It'll occur in the big city machines where they still have control.
[1:27:53.480 --> 1:27:56.800]  I'd watch Chicago because Trump could win Illinois.
[1:27:56.800 --> 1:27:59.160]  Trump is neck and neck within Illinois.
[1:27:59.160 --> 1:28:01.840]  Even without them turning out every day.
[1:28:01.840 --> 1:28:05.800]  So just like Kennedy, Robin Nixon, again, it's going to go to Illinois.
[1:28:05.800 --> 1:28:06.800]  It could.
[1:28:06.800 --> 1:28:12.400]  But that state should even be given recent history, should not be even on our list as
[1:28:12.400 --> 1:28:13.400]  winnable.
[1:28:13.400 --> 1:28:15.800]  So put that in your pipe and smoke it.
[1:28:15.800 --> 1:28:17.880]  Pennsylvania should be out of reach.
[1:28:17.880 --> 1:28:22.360]  Trump is doing so well among those blue collar working class people, the people who pay their
[1:28:22.360 --> 1:28:29.160]  taxes and don't attend riots and aren't protesting and who revere the flag and whose children
[1:28:29.160 --> 1:28:30.760]  serve in our military.
[1:28:30.760 --> 1:28:36.440]  Those voters, who went for Bill Clinton, by the way, in big numbers, those voters like
[1:28:36.440 --> 1:28:41.200]  Trump and therefore in the western part of the state, perhaps the most demographic part
[1:28:41.200 --> 1:28:42.200]  of the state.
[1:28:42.200 --> 1:28:43.200]  Trump is doing better than.
[1:28:43.200 --> 1:28:46.400]  I'm going to I'm going to totally put you on when we come back.
[1:28:46.400 --> 1:28:47.760]  I'm not even talking next segment.
[1:28:47.760 --> 1:28:49.200]  I'm going to put you in there the next segment.
[1:28:49.200 --> 1:28:50.200]  We need to lay it all out.
[1:28:50.200 --> 1:28:51.200]  Roger Stone.
[1:28:51.200 --> 1:28:52.200]  Stay with us.
[1:28:52.200 --> 1:28:55.520]  We're also going to take a few phone calls in the final segment, 877-789.
[1:28:55.520 --> 1:28:58.280]  Alex, phones now open.
[1:28:58.280 --> 1:29:02.440]  If you ever wanted a great deal on a powerful solar generator, but we're waiting for an
[1:29:02.440 --> 1:29:06.520]  outrageously low price, you are not going to want to miss this important message.
[1:29:06.520 --> 1:29:07.520]  Here's why.
[1:29:07.520 --> 1:29:11.400]  My friends, we already see major power grid problems and it's getting worse.
[1:29:11.400 --> 1:29:16.040]  So please listen, solar generators really do provide life saving electrical power and
[1:29:16.040 --> 1:29:21.040]  unlike gas generators, solar generators run silently, emit no fumes or gases, and produce
[1:29:21.040 --> 1:29:22.520]  electricity from the sun.
[1:29:22.520 --> 1:29:27.360]  Whether it's dangerous summer storms, blackouts, intensifying civil unrest, you're not going
[1:29:27.360 --> 1:29:29.760]  to have to suffer through it like the rest of the sheep.
[1:29:29.760 --> 1:29:32.440]  And here's the best news if you want to get one this week.
[1:29:32.440 --> 1:29:37.040]  Solutions from Science has a big sale on their fast charge solar generators and they're
[1:29:37.040 --> 1:29:41.560]  giving away a couple thousand dollars worth of off the grid gear in addition to the low
[1:29:41.560 --> 1:29:43.640]  price for in full wars listeners.
[1:29:43.640 --> 1:29:45.360]  So it's a good time to check it out.
[1:29:45.360 --> 1:29:46.360]  Go to gridwars.com.
[1:29:46.360 --> 1:29:47.360]  That's gridwars.com.
[1:29:47.360 --> 1:29:52.640]  It's a great opportunity to generate maximum electricity with minimum money.
[1:29:52.640 --> 1:29:53.640]  Go to gridwars.com.
[1:29:53.640 --> 1:29:54.640]  That's gridwars.com.
[1:29:54.640 --> 1:30:02.440]  Dr. Group, you developed Living Defense for us, it took you over a year to do it.
[1:30:02.440 --> 1:30:04.160]  Why is this so good?
[1:30:04.160 --> 1:30:08.880]  Because people are actually waking up to the problem that pretty much scares me the most.
[1:30:08.880 --> 1:30:13.480]  I mean, I try to make sure that I don't put toxins from food and water and beverages in
[1:30:13.480 --> 1:30:14.480]  my system.
[1:30:14.480 --> 1:30:20.480]  Right now, we're dealing with massive parasites, which is anything that's harmful to your body
[1:30:20.480 --> 1:30:22.520]  that lives off a host mechanism.
[1:30:22.520 --> 1:30:27.600]  Right now, with all the refugees spreading disease around, we have biological warfare
[1:30:27.600 --> 1:30:28.880]  going on everywhere.
[1:30:28.880 --> 1:30:29.880]  These are all parasites.
[1:30:29.880 --> 1:30:32.600]  Tell us about all the stuff that says there's so many things that are in it.
[1:30:32.600 --> 1:30:33.840]  You have the neem in there.
[1:30:33.840 --> 1:30:36.920]  You have the organic clove bud, the organic wormwood.
[1:30:36.920 --> 1:30:40.200]  I recommend doing a parasite cleanse at least twice a year.
[1:30:40.200 --> 1:30:41.200]  All right.
[1:30:41.200 --> 1:30:43.400]  Well, I'm glad we've got some back in because I'm going back on it today.
[1:30:43.400 --> 1:30:47.280]  We just came back in yesterday, Living Defense, infowarslife.com, and folks, you can't lose
[1:30:47.280 --> 1:30:53.520]  full of stuff that's great for your body, period, and you support the broadcast, infowarslife.com.
[1:30:53.520 --> 1:30:55.720]  Thank you, Dr. Group, from the Global Healing Center.
[1:30:55.720 --> 1:30:58.960]  Thank you so much for all your work, sir, on this great product.
[1:30:58.960 --> 1:31:00.800]  It's not just our water we need to filter.
[1:31:00.800 --> 1:31:02.840]  It's not just our food that needs to be cleaned.
[1:31:02.840 --> 1:31:05.720]  It's the air we're breathing, especially for our children.
[1:31:05.720 --> 1:31:11.760]  The artificial particulates of the chemicals is absolutely weighing down our immune systems.
[1:31:11.760 --> 1:31:16.720]  The same team based right here in America that brought you the Alexa Pure Groundbreaking

[1:31:26.800 --> 1:31:28.520]  you can to purify your air.
[1:31:28.520 --> 1:31:33.520]  The elite are masters at poisoning our environment while themselves doing things that mitigate
[1:31:33.520 --> 1:31:36.520]  or avoid most of the toxic effects for themselves.
[1:31:36.520 --> 1:31:38.720]  The general public doesn't.
[1:31:38.720 --> 1:31:42.680]  The Alexa Pure Breeze would be a steal at $300, $400, $500.
[1:31:42.680 --> 1:31:46.280]  One of these systems can keep 800 square feet incredibly clean.
[1:31:46.280 --> 1:31:49.840]  This is a system I'm personally putting in throughout my house, replacing older, more
[1:31:49.840 --> 1:31:53.040]  expensive filters that didn't do as good a job.

[1:33:16.520 --> 1:33:21.680]  Without even trying to, every day in the news, I see themes that emerge that aren't from
[1:33:21.680 --> 1:33:26.440]  the talking point to the social engineers, but are from the people, and I'm watching
[1:33:26.440 --> 1:33:34.840]  the calls just pour in for the next segment, and almost every one of them talks about martial
[1:33:34.840 --> 1:33:43.000]  law, a civil emergency, race war being launched to try to cancel or scuttle the election.
[1:33:43.000 --> 1:33:45.360]  What other false flags might Hillary pull?
[1:33:45.360 --> 1:33:47.080]  How do you steal an election?
[1:33:47.080 --> 1:33:49.200]  There's more than one way to skin a cat.

[1:34:51.160 --> 1:34:54.040]  Okay, Stone, we've got nine minutes left in the segment.
[1:34:54.040 --> 1:34:56.840]  You've got the floor, how do they steal an election?
[1:34:56.840 --> 1:34:57.840]  How do we block it?
[1:34:57.840 --> 1:34:58.840]  What do we do?
[1:34:58.840 --> 1:34:59.840]  And other things that are key.
[1:34:59.840 --> 1:35:05.360]  Well, Alex, I got to tell you that, you know, I've been working some long hours and I did
[1:35:05.360 --> 1:35:09.880]  go out for the celebration when Trump pulled the head in the national polls, but I did
[1:35:09.880 --> 1:35:14.400]  some of your liver cleanse the next morning and it got me back on track.
[1:35:14.400 --> 1:35:18.040]  Right now, to be honest with you, without soul brother number one, James Brown opening
[1:35:18.040 --> 1:35:22.320]  the segment and popping to brain force, I wouldn't be able to do this at all.
[1:35:22.320 --> 1:35:23.320]  I know.
[1:35:23.320 --> 1:35:28.200]  I got to say, you send me text messages at 2am, we talk at 3am, at 7am, I'm getting
[1:35:28.200 --> 1:35:29.600]  messages.
[1:35:29.600 --> 1:35:32.480]  You are literally pouring out your essence in this.
[1:35:32.480 --> 1:35:35.760]  You were telling me privately, I don't know if I can say this, but you said you've never
[1:35:35.760 --> 1:35:37.320]  put this much energy into a campaign.
[1:35:37.320 --> 1:35:38.320]  This is history.
[1:35:38.320 --> 1:35:42.680]  Yeah, no, it's exciting and you know, I'm waking up in the middle of the night and making
[1:35:42.680 --> 1:35:44.880]  notes of things that I just thought of.
[1:35:44.880 --> 1:35:47.200]  So I think Trump is doing great.
[1:35:47.200 --> 1:35:48.200]  You're absolutely right.
[1:35:48.200 --> 1:35:53.440]  You see, the whole criticism of this Muslim father that they put up at the convention
[1:35:53.440 --> 1:36:01.240]  is, he has pointed out a truth that Islam is a culture that does not respect and deed
[1:36:01.240 --> 1:36:03.160]  abuses women.
[1:36:03.160 --> 1:36:05.760]  So they've all said, how can he say that?
[1:36:05.760 --> 1:36:06.760]  But it's true.
[1:36:06.760 --> 1:36:11.400]  Unfortunately, the mother probably wasn't allowed to speak because it's not allowed
[1:36:11.400 --> 1:36:13.600]  in their culture.
[1:36:13.600 --> 1:36:15.840]  I feel very badly about these people's son.
[1:36:15.840 --> 1:36:21.080]  I honor anybody who served his country, but they should realize that their son died because
[1:36:21.080 --> 1:36:25.240]  of radical, hateful, murmurous, Islamic...
[1:36:25.240 --> 1:36:28.840]  Yeah, and look, you're at the so-called liberals claiming they're empowering women.
[1:36:28.840 --> 1:36:29.840]  I said I wouldn't interrupt.
[1:36:29.840 --> 1:36:32.240]  But you're bringing her up there wearing a fricking headdress.
[1:36:32.240 --> 1:36:33.240]  Sorry, go ahead.
[1:36:33.240 --> 1:36:36.200]  Yeah, and now what you see is kind of an interesting juxtaposition.
[1:36:36.200 --> 1:36:43.600]  You see, it used to be that Republicans were the anti-communist foreign policy hardliners.
[1:36:43.600 --> 1:36:47.040]  What was the charge against Barry Goldwater?
[1:36:47.040 --> 1:36:51.280]  He would get us into a war with the Russians.
[1:36:51.280 --> 1:36:56.600]  Trump is now being attacked for being close to the Russians, which is ironic in view of
[1:36:56.600 --> 1:37:02.160]  Hillary and Bill selling their souls and U.S. foreign policy decisions like control of
[1:37:02.160 --> 1:37:07.000]  uranium to the very oligarchs who are friendly with Putin, who's close to Putin, they're
[1:37:07.000 --> 1:37:08.000]  close to Putin.
[1:37:08.000 --> 1:37:09.680]  Donald Trump's never met Putin.
[1:37:09.680 --> 1:37:10.680]  That's what's crazy.
[1:37:10.680 --> 1:37:16.960]  But like Nixon, maybe Trump is the peacemaker that Putin wants to deal with.
[1:37:16.960 --> 1:37:19.680]  Maybe these guys can reach peace.
[1:37:19.680 --> 1:37:22.200]  It's obvious to me, Putin knows her well.
[1:37:22.200 --> 1:37:23.440]  He's read her emails.
[1:37:23.440 --> 1:37:27.640]  He knows she's a lying crook and he can't trust her in any deal that he tries to make.
[1:37:27.640 --> 1:37:29.920]  Let's recognize the pressures he's got.
[1:37:29.920 --> 1:37:31.120]  He's got a right wing, too.
[1:37:31.120 --> 1:37:32.520]  They want war.
[1:37:32.520 --> 1:37:34.720]  He'd like to have prosperity for his country.
[1:37:34.720 --> 1:37:38.600]  Now, he plays a tough hand in foreign policy and I don't love this.
[1:37:38.600 --> 1:37:39.920]  Well, that's what Putin keeps saying.
[1:37:39.920 --> 1:37:43.040]  He says Obama and Hillary break every deal they make.
[1:37:43.040 --> 1:37:45.920]  Well, he's out there fighting ISIS.
[1:37:45.920 --> 1:37:50.920]  We ought to be fighting ISIS more effectively at this point, having ISIS having been created
[1:37:50.920 --> 1:37:55.280]  by George W. Bush's policies and armed by Hillary Clinton.
[1:37:55.280 --> 1:37:57.120]  Now we have to deal with them.
[1:37:57.120 --> 1:38:04.320]  So this whole argument that Trump is too close to Putin, this is reverse McCarthyism.
[1:38:04.320 --> 1:38:05.600]  I see what Putin sees.
[1:38:05.600 --> 1:38:08.480]  He's taking the measure of both candidates.
[1:38:08.480 --> 1:38:13.040]  Well, sure, Hillary wants to make money on both sides of a war.
[1:38:13.040 --> 1:38:14.120]  Trump wants prosperity.
[1:38:14.120 --> 1:38:16.800]  The Russians would rather de-escalate this military buildup.
[1:38:16.800 --> 1:38:21.200]  Look, I think the easiest way to go to the most important thing I know you want to talk
[1:38:21.200 --> 1:38:23.160]  about, and I agree with you.
[1:38:23.160 --> 1:38:30.040]  I had a terrific interview the other day with Milo on the issue.
[1:38:30.040 --> 1:38:32.240]  And Breitbart on election fraud, it's excellent.
[1:38:32.240 --> 1:38:36.800]  Yeah, no, I think you, the first person to pinpoint this, the Clintons are capable of
[1:38:36.800 --> 1:38:43.160]  stealing this, and therefore I think Trump needs to definitively say, if there's any
[1:38:43.160 --> 1:38:49.600]  evidence whatsoever of voter fraud, if an analysis shows the swing behind between my
[1:38:49.600 --> 1:38:55.320]  private polls and the final outcome points out fraud, be clear.
[1:38:55.320 --> 1:38:57.920]  I will challenge your being sworn in.
[1:38:57.920 --> 1:39:00.600]  I will have my people march on Washington.
[1:39:00.600 --> 1:39:06.640]  We will block your inauguration, your in court, we will seek to, certainly.
[1:39:06.640 --> 1:39:08.360]  I think he needs to be very clear.
[1:39:08.360 --> 1:39:10.000]  We're not rolling over.
[1:39:10.000 --> 1:39:18.040]  Unlike Nixon, who sadly chose not to challenge the outcome of the 1960 elections, largely
[1:39:18.040 --> 1:39:21.280]  because unlike today, there was no paper trail.
[1:39:21.280 --> 1:39:23.240]  There's no way to do a recount in Texas.
[1:39:23.240 --> 1:39:27.840]  Lyndon Johnson had all the ballots burned within hours of the election.
[1:39:27.840 --> 1:39:29.600]  You couldn't recount Dallas County.
[1:39:29.600 --> 1:39:35.680]  The 95 Nixon Lodge votes they threw out that would have given Texas to the Republicans.
[1:39:35.680 --> 1:39:36.680]  Those ballots were burned.
[1:39:36.680 --> 1:39:39.800]  So what do you make of this delusion where they're saying they're going to try to get
[1:39:39.800 --> 1:39:44.200]  Cruz people to vote for nobody or somebody else or a third party to throw it to Hillary
[1:39:44.200 --> 1:39:45.200]  in Texas?
[1:39:45.200 --> 1:39:47.200]  All seven Cruz people.
[1:39:47.200 --> 1:39:49.600]  I hope Rick Perry challenges Cruz.
[1:39:49.600 --> 1:39:53.920]  I would go out and raise money for Rick Perry if he would challenge Cruz.
[1:39:53.920 --> 1:39:56.240]  Rick Perry would be a- No, no, I agree.
[1:39:56.240 --> 1:39:57.240]  Rick Perry is way better.
[1:39:57.240 --> 1:39:58.480]  At least he's a real Texan.
[1:39:58.480 --> 1:40:01.720]  He's a real conservative, too, when it comes to economics.
[1:40:01.720 --> 1:40:03.360]  I don't agree with Rick Perry.
[1:40:03.360 --> 1:40:07.400]  He did do some, I agree, compared to, I hear you, I would support Rick Perry over Cruz.
[1:40:07.400 --> 1:40:13.200]  Not even close, you know, and hopefully Donald Trump will encourage him in that endeavor.
[1:40:13.200 --> 1:40:16.680]  So I don't know what Cruz people you're talking about, red-blooded American tech-
[1:40:16.680 --> 1:40:21.160]  Now I'm talking about the Star Telegram and others are pushing this after non-endorsement
[1:40:21.160 --> 1:40:23.560]  will Texans stand by U.S. Senator Ted Cruz.
[1:40:23.560 --> 1:40:24.560]  No.
[1:40:24.560 --> 1:40:26.200]  He's, first of all, there aren't that many of them.
[1:40:26.200 --> 1:40:29.360]  He's hurt his standing in Texas very badly by being a duplex.
[1:40:29.360 --> 1:40:30.360]  Oh, I agree.
[1:40:30.360 --> 1:40:31.360]  I agree.
[1:40:31.360 --> 1:40:32.360]  It just shows how desperate they are.
[1:40:32.360 --> 1:40:33.360]  Texans don't like liars.
[1:40:33.360 --> 1:40:34.360]  This guy gave his word.
[1:40:34.360 --> 1:40:36.240]  He signed a public pledge.
[1:40:36.240 --> 1:40:39.080]  So there's no dispute.
[1:40:39.080 --> 1:40:40.720]  It's all about Ted.
[1:40:40.720 --> 1:40:44.680]  He can kiss his U.S. Senate seat goodbye if you ask me.
[1:40:44.680 --> 1:40:46.440]  I think there's a landslide for Trump.
[1:40:46.440 --> 1:40:48.040]  I know you don't be too optimistic, man.
[1:40:48.040 --> 1:40:51.320]  Every liberal I talk to all over the country, they go, yeah, I'm going to go third part
[1:40:51.320 --> 1:40:52.320]  of your Trump.
[1:40:52.320 --> 1:40:54.320]  They're just scared to say it.
[1:40:54.320 --> 1:41:00.280]  I must tell you, Alex, I think you have to not underestimate the Clinton's organizational
[1:41:00.280 --> 1:41:06.120]  ability to turn out every vagrant, every homeless person, every illegal, and they're
[1:41:06.120 --> 1:41:11.120]  even in court in California and other places, in New York, they now want to vote illegals.
[1:41:11.120 --> 1:41:12.120]  No, no.
[1:41:12.120 --> 1:41:13.120]  They don't pay taxes.
[1:41:13.120 --> 1:41:17.000]  So that's what Trump says, the Democrats are trying to legalize illegals to vote.
[1:41:17.000 --> 1:41:18.840]  I mean, it's fraud right there.
[1:41:18.840 --> 1:41:19.840]  Yes.
[1:41:19.840 --> 1:41:21.520]  So I don't stand for any of that.
[1:41:21.520 --> 1:41:23.320]  You could have a constitutional crisis.
[1:41:23.320 --> 1:41:27.520]  Well, that's what's beautiful is that he's got the way of those.
[1:41:27.520 --> 1:41:30.000]  He challenged Cruz and the Republicans trying to steal it.
[1:41:30.000 --> 1:41:31.000]  They rolled over.
[1:41:31.000 --> 1:41:34.120]  I mean, do they understand that Trump is going to stand against them?
[1:41:34.120 --> 1:41:39.160]  I don't think they've yet figured out that they're not going to be able to bury Goldwater
[1:41:39.160 --> 1:41:44.120]  Horizon, their whole attitude is that, particularly as things get worse for them, that they don't
[1:41:44.120 --> 1:41:49.160]  want to refute Trump on any of the issues, trade, immigration, jobs, they're just going
[1:41:49.160 --> 1:41:50.160]  to try to destroy him.
[1:41:50.160 --> 1:41:52.720]  In other words, they'll never, they'll never be sure.
[1:41:52.720 --> 1:41:53.720]  What about the debates?
[1:41:53.720 --> 1:41:54.760]  I mean, they know he'll kill her.
[1:41:54.760 --> 1:41:56.760]  So now they're trying to hide them politically.
[1:41:56.760 --> 1:41:59.160]  They're trying to hide it now under NFL games.
[1:41:59.160 --> 1:42:00.160]  Yeah.
[1:42:00.160 --> 1:42:02.400]  I don't think that is going to work very well.
[1:42:02.400 --> 1:42:08.160]  Again, the Stephanopoulos is the Chuck Todd's want to nitpick Trump on whether he got a
[1:42:08.160 --> 1:42:11.000]  letter from the NFL pointless.
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:13.720]  They did this exact same thing to Bernie.
[1:42:13.720 --> 1:42:18.560]  Have we forgotten that they scheduled the early Democratic debates during games so that
[1:42:18.560 --> 1:42:19.560]  nobody would watch them?
[1:42:19.560 --> 1:42:23.680]  If Bernie supporters don't vote for Trump, they are.
[1:42:23.680 --> 1:42:26.440]  How could they all not just for the integrity of our elections?
[1:42:26.440 --> 1:42:29.080]  Well, first of all, I don't think they will.
[1:42:29.080 --> 1:42:30.080]  Some will.
[1:42:30.080 --> 1:42:32.520]  Obviously, Bernie's hard left votes were the true.
[1:42:32.520 --> 1:42:33.520]  Then that puts him way over the top.
[1:42:33.520 --> 1:42:36.200]  I mean, they were the majority of the voters for Hillary.
[1:42:36.200 --> 1:42:40.000]  But Trump only needs about a third of Bernie's voters to win.
[1:42:40.000 --> 1:42:44.360]  I'm telling you, at all hinges on Bernie, like you would say in a year ago, Roger Stone,
[1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:50.360]  StoneZone.com, the T-shirt, Clinton, with the word rape under it, get it out there.
[1:42:50.360 --> 1:42:55.000]  This is such a time to be alive in FullWarStore.com, 20 percent off on all apparel, 40 percent
[1:42:55.000 --> 1:42:56.000]  off on nutraceuticals.
[1:42:56.000 --> 1:42:58.880]  It ends tonight at midnight.
[1:42:58.880 --> 1:43:05.200]  Trump slams Hillary's DNC speech and denounces her globalist agenda.
[1:43:05.200 --> 1:43:10.560]  Donald Trump immediately reacted to Hillary Clinton's keynote speech at the Democratic
[1:43:10.560 --> 1:43:16.640]  National Convention last night, sending out a series of tweets hitting her on her economic
[1:43:16.640 --> 1:43:18.560]  and foreign policies.
[1:43:18.560 --> 1:43:24.160]  Trump says Hillary will never reform Wall Street because she is owned by Wall Street.
[1:43:24.160 --> 1:43:30.920]  And he says that Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power,
[1:43:30.920 --> 1:43:33.480]  no jobs, and no safety.
[1:43:33.480 --> 1:43:39.400]  Trump also slammed Hillary for being soft on the threat of terrorism, noting that Americans'
[1:43:39.400 --> 1:43:43.520]  way of life is under threat by radical Islam.
[1:43:43.520 --> 1:43:47.400]  And Hillary Clinton can't even bring herself to say the words.
[1:43:47.400 --> 1:43:54.080]  And in a final tweet, Trump urged that no one has worse judgment than Hillary Clinton.
[1:43:54.080 --> 1:43:58.080]  And you can learn more right now at Infowars.com.

[1:44:59.880 --> 1:45:03.600]  Pharmacist Ben Fuchs here, host of the Bright Side, and as many of you know, I'm on a mission
[1:45:03.600 --> 1:45:05.880]  to help Americans get and stay healthy.
[1:45:05.880 --> 1:45:08.160]  You've all heard the shocking statistics.
[1:45:08.160 --> 1:45:12.760]  Despite spending trillions of dollars in healthcare, nearly $10,000 per man, woman, and child in
[1:45:12.760 --> 1:45:18.240]  this country, obesity, diabetes, cancer, heart disease, and autoimmune illnesses are rampant.
[1:45:18.240 --> 1:45:21.520]  One out of three or four people is dealing with some kind of health challenge and everyone
[1:45:21.520 --> 1:45:24.160]  knows at least one person with a degenerative disease.
[1:45:24.160 --> 1:45:27.360]  If you are dealing with a health challenge or if you're healthy and want to maintain
[1:45:27.360 --> 1:45:31.320]  your vigor and longevity, and you're looking for a convenient, easy way to incorporate

[1:46:13.400 --> 1:46:15.000]  at InfowarsStore.com.

[1:46:18.840 --> 1:46:22.920]  auto-ship because we hold back a surplus for auto-ship customers.
[1:46:22.920 --> 1:46:28.160]  Number three, we're giving you free shipping on all orders above $50.
[1:46:28.160 --> 1:46:32.360]  Listeners have been requesting this for years because it's so easy to forget to reorder the
[1:46:32.360 --> 1:46:34.000]  products that you need each month.

[1:46:47.040 --> 1:46:48.440]  this is a sure win.

[1:46:59.240 --> 1:47:21.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:47:21.080 --> 1:47:29.680]  Trashing through the lies and disinformation, it's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[1:47:29.680 --> 1:47:32.280]  I thank God every day I run my own broadcasts.
[1:47:32.280 --> 1:47:36.800]  I can't even keep track of all the information, much less craft it, spend it, get orders,
[1:47:36.800 --> 1:47:37.800]  get talking points.
[1:47:37.800 --> 1:47:41.800]  That's why they got teleprompters because they're slaves.
[1:47:41.800 --> 1:47:44.560]  I'm not, and you're not, and I love you.
[1:47:44.560 --> 1:47:48.560]  I'm very humbled by our audience, I'm very humbled by our listeners, I'm very humbled
[1:47:48.560 --> 1:47:53.040]  by all your prayers, and I am very blessed to be here.
[1:47:53.040 --> 1:47:54.680]  And I'm very thankful for this position.
[1:47:54.680 --> 1:47:55.680]  Don't thank me.
[1:47:55.680 --> 1:47:58.560]  This is a real blessing.
[1:47:58.560 --> 1:47:59.560]  History is happening right now.
[1:47:59.560 --> 1:48:04.440]  You can feel the energy level rising, and whether Trump wins or loses, this is the animating
[1:48:04.440 --> 1:48:05.920]  contest of liberty.
[1:48:05.920 --> 1:48:08.000]  Roger Stone of StoneZone.com is our guest.
[1:48:08.000 --> 1:48:10.560]  I want to race through your calls now.
[1:48:10.560 --> 1:48:13.080]  Rich in Texas, then Frank in New York.
[1:48:13.080 --> 1:48:14.720]  Rich in Texas, thank you for calling.
[1:48:14.720 --> 1:48:15.720]  You're on the air.
[1:48:15.720 --> 1:48:16.720]  Go ahead.
[1:48:16.720 --> 1:48:21.760]  Hey Alex, hey Roger, it was a pleasure to talk to both of you.
[1:48:21.760 --> 1:48:23.840]  I just wanted to make a quick comment.
[1:48:23.840 --> 1:48:27.960]  I flew to Cleveland to see you guys at your freedom speech rally.
[1:48:27.960 --> 1:48:28.960]  Thank you.
[1:48:28.960 --> 1:48:31.480]  What an amazing event.
[1:48:31.480 --> 1:48:37.440]  It was just so awesome to see those kinds of people gathering together, the open carry
[1:48:37.440 --> 1:48:42.240]  that they had, the Hillary for Prison shirts, and it was just an amazing atmosphere.
[1:48:42.240 --> 1:48:45.840]  Yeah, it's crazy to see a town with tens of thousands on the streets wearing Hillary
[1:48:45.840 --> 1:48:46.840]  for Prison shirts.
[1:48:46.840 --> 1:48:48.960]  It totally scared the establishment.
[1:48:48.960 --> 1:48:49.960]  Great point.
[1:48:49.960 --> 1:48:53.600]  And I see in the comments here, because we don't screen your calls, folks can add a comment.
[1:48:53.600 --> 1:48:57.040]  It says, your whole church has switched from supporting Cruz to Trump.
[1:48:57.040 --> 1:48:58.840]  Can you tell us about that?
[1:48:58.840 --> 1:48:59.840]  I sure can.
[1:48:59.840 --> 1:49:04.920]  Let me tell you, believe it or not, I go to Cornerstone Church, here, Pastor Hagee's
[1:49:04.920 --> 1:49:10.240]  church here in Texas, and they were totally supportive of Cruz.
[1:49:10.240 --> 1:49:16.560]  I'd say 30% at the front was for Donald Trump, but they are completely on board with Donald
[1:49:16.560 --> 1:49:17.560]  Trump now.
[1:49:17.560 --> 1:49:18.560]  That's great.
[1:49:18.560 --> 1:49:20.560]  Has Hagee switched?
[1:49:20.560 --> 1:49:22.080]  I can tell you his son has.
[1:49:22.080 --> 1:49:23.080]  Matthew has.
[1:49:23.080 --> 1:49:24.080]  Well, good.
[1:49:24.080 --> 1:49:25.080]  Good, good, good for them.
[1:49:25.080 --> 1:49:26.080]  I mean, the guy's a great preacher.
[1:49:26.080 --> 1:49:27.080]  I disagree with some of the stuff he says.
[1:49:27.080 --> 1:49:30.960]  I mean, the guys are great orator, but I just hate the fact that he gets so neocon.
[1:49:30.960 --> 1:49:31.960]  Amazing call.
[1:49:31.960 --> 1:49:34.320]  Roger, is that, that's what I'm hearing from everybody, Roger.
[1:49:34.320 --> 1:49:39.440]  Yeah, I don't, this is, again, the media trying to make trouble.
[1:49:39.440 --> 1:49:44.480]  Ted Cruz, like all of our Republican candidates who ran against Donald, including Jeb, are
[1:49:44.480 --> 1:49:48.880]  invited to speak at the convention on the conditions that they will support the ticket.
[1:49:48.880 --> 1:49:51.200]  They're not even required to use the word endorse.
[1:49:51.200 --> 1:49:54.160]  They can call for Republican victory from the top to the bottom.
[1:49:54.160 --> 1:50:01.680]  They can say they're voting Trump Pence, Walker, Christie, Rubio, all proved to be honorable
[1:50:01.680 --> 1:50:02.680]  men.
[1:50:02.680 --> 1:50:05.680]  They're allowed to speak, Rubio by video, and they all endorse the ticket.
[1:50:05.680 --> 1:50:11.280]  Ted agrees to endorse the ticket, and then he knifes Donald Trump in the back like a
[1:50:11.280 --> 1:50:12.280]  grutus.
[1:50:12.280 --> 1:50:15.280]  Ted Cruz, Ted Cruz is dishonor.
[1:50:15.280 --> 1:50:18.240]  Trump was magnanimous to even invite him.
[1:50:18.240 --> 1:50:19.240]  So he's double-dell.
[1:50:19.240 --> 1:50:23.120]  Now, Ted Cruz is the Nelson Rockefeller Republican Party.
[1:50:23.120 --> 1:50:24.680]  He's the guy who walked away when we were...
[1:50:24.680 --> 1:50:26.680]  Ted Cruz is dishonor in the dictionary.
[1:50:26.680 --> 1:50:29.480]  He thinks he's going to come back and scoop up the marbles?
[1:50:29.480 --> 1:50:30.480]  Not a chance.
[1:50:30.480 --> 1:50:32.480]  The Trump people aren't going away.
[1:50:32.480 --> 1:50:37.320]  After eight years of a Trump presidency, Ted would be too old to be president anyway.
[1:50:37.320 --> 1:50:42.000]  And he would be negated by the conservatives, just as they remember Rockefeller doing this
[1:50:42.000 --> 1:50:46.440]  to Goldwater, which lost in the 68 nomination, which forced him from the...
[1:50:46.440 --> 1:50:47.440]  No, I agree.
[1:50:47.440 --> 1:50:48.440]  Why did he destroy himself?
[1:50:48.440 --> 1:50:49.440]  Go on with them or goals.
[1:50:49.440 --> 1:50:51.280]  Ted Cruz is a pariah with the conservatives I speak to.
[1:50:51.280 --> 1:50:54.280]  Why did he destroy himself and become the definition of dishonor?
[1:50:54.280 --> 1:50:55.280]  You lose our feet, too?
[1:50:55.280 --> 1:50:56.280]  Yeah, I think I've lost audio.
[1:50:56.280 --> 1:50:57.280]  That's why he couldn't hear me.
[1:50:57.280 --> 1:50:58.280]  Roger, can you hear me?
[1:50:58.280 --> 1:51:07.760]  All right, let's... we'll go to another call here, Frank in New York, Frank here on the
[1:51:07.760 --> 1:51:08.760]  air.
[1:51:08.760 --> 1:51:09.760]  Go ahead.
[1:51:09.760 --> 1:51:10.760]  Michael.
[1:51:10.760 --> 1:51:11.760]  God bless you.
[1:51:11.760 --> 1:51:12.760]  Alex and Roger Stone.
[1:51:12.760 --> 1:51:13.760]  You guys are true patriots.
[1:51:13.760 --> 1:51:14.760]  Thank you.
[1:51:14.760 --> 1:51:15.760]  Go ahead.
[1:51:15.760 --> 1:51:16.760]  All right.
[1:51:16.760 --> 1:51:17.760]  Is Mr. Stone there?
[1:51:17.760 --> 1:51:18.760]  Is there audio there?
[1:51:18.760 --> 1:51:19.760]  I believe...
[1:51:19.760 --> 1:51:20.760]  Do we have Stone's audio back, guys?
[1:51:20.760 --> 1:51:21.760]  We're trying to fix him.
[1:51:21.760 --> 1:51:22.760]  Go ahead and make your point.
[1:51:22.760 --> 1:51:23.760]  We're running out of time.
[1:51:23.760 --> 1:51:24.760]  Go ahead.
[1:51:24.760 --> 1:51:25.760]  Sure, sure, sure.
[1:51:25.760 --> 1:51:26.760]  Okay.
[1:51:26.760 --> 1:51:29.760]  I have a question real quick.
[1:51:29.760 --> 1:51:34.680]  Let's say if Mr. Trump is head by, say, by 1050 points by October, do you think the
[1:51:34.680 --> 1:51:38.120]  bill will enact presidential for direct-to-51 in sustaining elections?
[1:51:38.120 --> 1:51:41.360]  Do you think that's a possibility?
[1:51:41.360 --> 1:51:44.760]  I think they could activate the whole communist movement, the Black Lives Matter movement.
[1:51:44.760 --> 1:51:48.160]  I mean, who would ever think the president, when the cops get shot, would say, the police
[1:51:48.160 --> 1:51:49.880]  need to reform is their fault.
[1:51:49.880 --> 1:51:54.880]  Clearly, they're looking at this and beta testing, some type of simile uprising as a
[1:51:54.880 --> 1:51:55.880]  smoke stream.
[1:51:55.880 --> 1:51:56.880]  We're trying to get the audio of a Stone.
[1:51:56.880 --> 1:51:57.880]  Stone, did you hear that?
[1:51:57.880 --> 1:51:58.880]  All right.
[1:51:58.880 --> 1:51:59.880]  Well, we had a lot...
[1:51:59.880 --> 1:52:00.880]  Oh, he did hear?
[1:52:00.880 --> 1:52:01.880]  Well, let's put him back on air then.
[1:52:01.880 --> 1:52:02.880]  Go ahead, Roger.
[1:52:02.880 --> 1:52:03.880]  Did you hear his concern about martial law or civil emergency?
[1:52:03.880 --> 1:52:04.880]  I missed that one.
[1:52:04.880 --> 1:52:05.880]  So go ahead.
[1:52:05.880 --> 1:52:07.880]  A lot of people are concerned about martial law, moved to martial law, civil emergency,
[1:52:07.880 --> 1:52:08.880]  is another way.
[1:52:08.880 --> 1:52:09.880]  I think it is unlikely.
[1:52:09.880 --> 1:52:10.880]  Let me tell you why.
[1:52:10.880 --> 1:52:30.440]  I think they understand as much as they are morally capable of that, that it would not
[1:52:30.440 --> 1:52:36.680]  pass muster, neither internationally nor locally, that he would literally have an armed insurrection
[1:52:36.680 --> 1:52:37.680]  against the government.
[1:52:37.680 --> 1:52:46.840]  So what is far more like, now that Scalia has been taken care of, is to steal this election,
[1:52:46.840 --> 1:52:50.160]  understanding that Trump has the gumption to fight right to the bitter end over the
[1:52:50.160 --> 1:52:52.160]  legitimacy of it.
[1:52:52.160 --> 1:52:56.560]  His lawsuits end up going to the Supreme Court, and they try to steal it there.
[1:52:56.560 --> 1:53:01.960]  You'll still have the illegitimacy, and Trump will not stop fighting that.
[1:53:01.960 --> 1:53:07.480]  But that's a more likely scenario, fix it in the Supreme Court.
[1:53:07.480 --> 1:53:12.160]  It's outrageous because the steal will be audacious.
[1:53:12.160 --> 1:53:17.680]  But I think that's more likely than martial law that just allows Barack Obama to remain
[1:53:17.680 --> 1:53:20.080]  president without an election.
[1:53:20.080 --> 1:53:21.600]  You could never sell that internet.
[1:53:21.600 --> 1:53:22.600]  Sure, I agree.
[1:53:22.600 --> 1:53:27.480]  But they could have a civil emergency riots to make it all racial right before the election
[1:53:27.480 --> 1:53:31.320]  as a distraction, but that would actually only help Trump because he'd point out what
[1:53:31.320 --> 1:53:32.320]  they were doing.
[1:53:32.320 --> 1:53:33.320]  Well, exactly.
[1:53:33.320 --> 1:53:35.040]  They leave their fingerprints every place.
[1:53:35.040 --> 1:53:38.360]  So they can put up a phony series of riots.
[1:53:38.360 --> 1:53:39.360]  They'll get caught.
[1:53:39.360 --> 1:53:43.240]  I mean, they advertise on Craigslist for demonstrators.
[1:53:43.240 --> 1:53:44.240]  You're right.
[1:53:44.240 --> 1:53:45.240]  You're right.
[1:53:45.240 --> 1:53:46.740]  Frank, great question.
[1:53:46.740 --> 1:53:47.740]  Thank you.
[1:53:47.740 --> 1:53:48.740]  Another question on martial law.
[1:53:48.740 --> 1:53:49.740]  Real fast.
[1:53:49.740 --> 1:53:51.740]  Kristin, Georgia, you're on the air with rogerstonoshtonesony.com.
[1:53:51.740 --> 1:53:52.740]  Yes, hello, Alice.
[1:53:52.740 --> 1:53:53.740]  How are you?
[1:53:53.740 --> 1:53:54.740]  Great, brother.
[1:53:54.740 --> 1:53:55.740]  Go ahead.
[1:53:55.740 --> 1:53:56.740]  Yes.
[1:53:56.740 --> 1:54:02.800]  What I was basically going to say about martial law is Obama knows damn well if he declares
[1:54:02.800 --> 1:54:05.840]  martial law that he's going to bat fire 100 percent.
[1:54:05.840 --> 1:54:11.280]  He knows there are more people in Patriots' Enform in the entire military.
[1:54:11.280 --> 1:54:14.880]  And if he declares martial law, he may have to move overseas because we're going to take
[1:54:14.880 --> 1:54:15.880]  over the White House.
[1:54:15.880 --> 1:54:16.880]  That's basically what could happen.
[1:54:16.880 --> 1:54:17.880]  Listen, I agree.
[1:54:17.880 --> 1:54:21.360]  And I don't say this with pleasure because I'm scared of stuff like this, but the military
[1:54:21.360 --> 1:54:23.440]  and police are totally awake.
[1:54:23.440 --> 1:54:24.440]  And that's a good news here.
[1:54:24.440 --> 1:54:27.300]  If the globalists try some hanky-panky, they're in trouble.
[1:54:27.300 --> 1:54:28.800]  Thank you so much, Chris rogerston.
[1:54:28.800 --> 1:54:35.640]  Yeah, I kind of agree that you could have a scenario in which the average police officer
[1:54:35.640 --> 1:54:38.440]  is conflicted about where his loyalties are.
[1:54:38.440 --> 1:54:43.640]  I wouldn't assume because they can only use the police state to try to close down a widespread
[1:54:43.640 --> 1:54:48.040]  protest, civil disobedience, and God forbid violence.
[1:54:48.040 --> 1:54:51.720]  But if they steal all the election and people are protesting against cop killers, are the
[1:54:51.720 --> 1:54:52.720]  cops going to...
[1:54:52.720 --> 1:54:53.720]  No, they're going to stand down.
[1:54:53.720 --> 1:54:54.720]  Exactly.
[1:54:54.720 --> 1:54:59.760]  I mean, some of them will stand with the revolutionaries like us.
[1:54:59.760 --> 1:55:03.560]  These are patriotic Americans, the people who are the police officers in this country.
[1:55:03.560 --> 1:55:06.600]  By and large, they believe in playing by the rules.
[1:55:06.600 --> 1:55:09.680]  And the globalists have taken our restraints weakness.
[1:55:09.680 --> 1:55:11.680]  They'll understand.
[1:55:11.680 --> 1:55:15.040]  We're restrained because we're peaceful people, but you can't push too far.
[1:55:15.040 --> 1:55:18.480]  Well, their biggest problem, of course, is that they don't like guns.
[1:55:18.480 --> 1:55:19.920]  They don't like to own them.
[1:55:19.920 --> 1:55:22.400]  It's okay for the police to have them.
[1:55:22.400 --> 1:55:23.400]  Let's face it.
[1:55:23.400 --> 1:55:27.080]  They have the right to exercise their second amendment rights, and therefore, they see
[1:55:27.080 --> 1:55:33.080]  that as armed people out there who will fight an illegitimate effort to steal the country.
[1:55:33.080 --> 1:55:36.600]  That's why they're always trying to disarm us by various chicanes.
[1:55:36.600 --> 1:55:38.640]  They know about our checkmate, Chris in Indiana.
[1:55:38.640 --> 1:55:42.200]  You're only able to Roger Stone, Elm Jones, Chris, you've got a point about closeted Trump
[1:55:42.200 --> 1:55:43.200]  supporters.
[1:55:43.200 --> 1:55:44.200]  Go ahead.
[1:55:44.200 --> 1:55:45.200]  Hey, Alex.
[1:55:45.200 --> 1:55:46.200]  Hey, Roger.
[1:55:46.200 --> 1:55:47.200]  Yeah.
[1:55:47.200 --> 1:55:48.200]  First of all, I'm looking forward.
[1:55:48.200 --> 1:55:54.000]  I got a free book from you for ordering from the big sale you had, from Roger Stone, the
[1:55:54.000 --> 1:55:55.000]  Clintons' Warm Women.
[1:55:55.000 --> 1:56:00.560]  And I'm looking forward to reading the details on why Webster Hubble's the real father of
[1:56:00.560 --> 1:56:01.560]  Chelsea.
[1:56:01.560 --> 1:56:02.560]  Oh, that's her dad.
[1:56:02.560 --> 1:56:03.560]  She looks just like him.
[1:56:03.560 --> 1:56:05.000]  No, there's no question about it.
[1:56:05.000 --> 1:56:09.760]  So I tweeted the other night, Webster Hubble's daughter, Chelsea Clinton, knocks it out of
[1:56:09.760 --> 1:56:15.560]  the park at Democratic convention, Ivanka Trump, she is not.
[1:56:15.560 --> 1:56:21.320]  So it is, you know, it's, look, it's a minor point, but all it shows you is how dysfunctional
[1:56:21.320 --> 1:56:25.840]  the and completely wanton the Clintons are.
[1:56:25.840 --> 1:56:26.840]  It's all fake.
[1:56:26.840 --> 1:56:27.840]  It's all a fraud.
[1:56:27.840 --> 1:56:31.080]  So the whole, the whole marriage, Hillary is the right man for Clinton.
[1:56:31.080 --> 1:56:33.560]  But Chris, what's your point about closeted Trump supporters?
[1:56:33.560 --> 1:56:38.280]  Well, hey, I was at a South Bend Cubs game the other day.
[1:56:38.280 --> 1:56:41.000]  It's a minor league for Cubs affiliate here, South Bend, Indiana.
[1:56:41.000 --> 1:56:42.720]  And I was walking around with a Trump shirt.
[1:56:42.720 --> 1:56:45.480]  I went to another one with a Hillary for prison shirt.
[1:56:45.480 --> 1:56:47.440]  I was getting high fives and stuff from people.
[1:56:47.440 --> 1:56:51.600]  I actually sat down and by the way, my parents, who are Trump supporters too, didn't even
[1:56:51.600 --> 1:56:54.360]  want to be seen with me with the Hillary for prison shirt.
[1:56:54.360 --> 1:56:55.560]  It's that shameful for them.
[1:56:55.560 --> 1:56:56.560]  Oh my gosh.
[1:56:56.560 --> 1:57:00.560]  Anyway, I was sit, I went and sat down and about three rows up for me.
[1:57:00.560 --> 1:57:05.600]  There was a family and a trendy liberal girl that's probably like 20 years old looks back
[1:57:05.600 --> 1:57:06.960]  and she's like, Oh, I like your shirt.
[1:57:06.960 --> 1:57:07.960]  And I like spread it out.
[1:57:07.960 --> 1:57:09.840]  And she's like, cause she didn't see for prison.
[1:57:09.840 --> 1:57:11.800]  I'm all she's like, Oh, never mind.
[1:57:11.800 --> 1:57:12.800]  I don't like your shirt.
[1:57:12.800 --> 1:57:18.120]  And her parents like wave back and put their hands over their, over their mouth and they're
[1:57:18.120 --> 1:57:20.560]  like, Oh, we agree with your shirt.
[1:57:20.560 --> 1:57:21.560]  Don't mind her.
[1:57:21.560 --> 1:57:22.560]  I hear you.
[1:57:22.560 --> 1:57:23.560]  We're out of time.
[1:57:23.560 --> 1:57:24.560]  Sorry.
[1:57:24.560 --> 1:57:25.560]  The other callers, Brian, Mark, Richard.
[1:57:25.560 --> 1:57:26.560]  I'll be back tomorrow.
[1:57:26.560 --> 1:57:27.560]  11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central.
[1:57:27.560 --> 1:57:28.560]  Roger Stone.
[1:57:28.560 --> 1:57:30.080]  Thank you so much for all you're doing.
[1:57:30.080 --> 1:57:31.560]  It's just so great to know you.
[1:57:31.560 --> 1:57:34.120]  You're such a smart guy, funny guy.
[1:57:34.120 --> 1:57:35.120]  We love you.
[1:57:35.120 --> 1:57:38.160]  Keep up the good work and thank you for all your analysis here on air.
[1:57:38.160 --> 1:57:41.080]  Alex, victory or death?
[1:57:41.080 --> 1:57:42.080]  Patrick Henry.
[1:57:42.080 --> 1:57:43.080]  Victory or death?
[1:57:43.080 --> 1:57:44.080]  Absolutely.
[1:57:44.080 --> 1:57:45.080]  Or Colonel Travis.
[1:57:45.080 --> 1:57:46.080]  Victory or death.
[1:57:46.080 --> 1:57:47.080]  All right.
[1:57:47.080 --> 1:57:48.080]  Great job.
