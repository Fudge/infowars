[00:00.000 --> 00:24.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:24.000 --> 00:53.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[00:53.000 --> 01:11.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:23.000 --> 01:45.000]  From the front lines of the Information War, it's Alex Jones.
[01:45.000 --> 01:53.000]  Police with axes and assault rifles raided this venue in Sao Paulo and found about 600 party goers, most without masks.
[01:53.000 --> 01:57.000]  It was a case of asking people to go home, and if they didn't, arresting them.
[01:57.000 --> 02:05.000]  Nine police checkpoints have now been set up around the perimeter of Auckland as its 1.6 million residents returned to level 3 lockdown.
[02:05.000 --> 02:11.000]  This is the video that raised questions about how New York City is enforcing social distancing.
[02:11.000 --> 02:14.000]  A man was handcuffed in the stands for not wearing a mask.
[02:14.000 --> 02:21.000]  Disturbing video showing a violent clash between apparent social distancing violators and police in Brooklyn.
[02:21.000 --> 02:30.000]  And this cellphone video capturing the moment an officer waves a taser and repeatedly strikes a bystander during a social distancing bust.
[02:30.000 --> 02:40.000]  Get your hands off of me! You are kidnapping me! I have got nothing illegal!
[02:40.000 --> 02:47.000]  Canadians are being hit with penalties now as governments move to reinforce the shutdowns right across the country.
[02:47.000 --> 02:50.000]  And the city is also taking their mask mandate seriously.
[02:50.000 --> 02:56.000]  A fire rescue commissioner from the Tampa area was arrested on Duval Street Wednesday night when he and others were spotted without masks.
[02:56.000 --> 03:04.000]  It's more than just a suggestion, it is a CDC recommendation that has all become sort of like lock law that you can't really trifle with.
[03:04.000 --> 03:13.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this gathering is unfortunately unlawful under the coronavirus regulations we have currently.
[03:13.000 --> 03:20.000]  The officer explains that she is being arrested. When she continues to resist, he uses his taser.
[03:20.000 --> 03:23.000]  Put your hands right here.
[03:23.000 --> 03:25.000]  You're not going to beat the tape.
[03:25.000 --> 03:27.000]  Yes you are. I will tase you right now.
[03:27.000 --> 03:29.000]  What disturbance did I cause? What tape?
[03:29.000 --> 03:37.000]  March 12th at Longos. How did I cause a disturbance? I claimed the mask exemption and I did my shopping and I left.
[03:37.000 --> 03:39.000]  So you cannot arrest me, I'm not getting out of the car.
[03:39.000 --> 04:02.000]  They block off the entire f***ing street with cop cars, SUVs, cop cars, block streets, both ends.
[04:02.000 --> 04:17.000]  The answer to 1984 is 1776.
[04:17.000 --> 04:28.000]  Infowars has been banned, arrested, attacked and threatened.
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.000]  Because we are effective, the great awakening is here.
[04:33.000 --> 04:39.000]  Go to banned.video, download the videos and share.
[04:39.000 --> 04:57.000]  Support the information war at infowarstore.com and never give up the fight.
[04:57.000 --> 05:05.000]  Listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so saying,
[05:05.000 --> 05:09.000]  where are most of the best selling products you have that we love?
[05:09.000 --> 05:12.000]  And my answer is the supply chain has broken down.
[05:12.000 --> 05:15.000]  I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot of these.
[05:15.000 --> 05:18.000]  And so that's why we don't have a lot of products in.
[05:18.000 --> 05:23.000]  That's why info wars is in financial trouble is because if we had the product, you would be buying it, we'd have the money.
[05:23.000 --> 05:28.000]  But so many of them have been sold out, just like you noticed a lot of other items at the store aren't available
[05:28.000 --> 05:31.000]  because civilization is being artificially imploded.
[05:31.000 --> 05:38.000]  But finally, X2 is back in stock with a good halogen, deep earth crystal iodide, so essential in your body.
[05:38.000 --> 05:41.000]  It's really the missing link. It's 50% off.
[05:41.000 --> 05:43.000]  We've got a big shipment of it at infowarstore.com.
[05:43.000 --> 05:48.000]  Now when it gets ready to sell out, we'll have to go back to near full price, take advantage of this now, stock up.
[05:48.000 --> 05:53.000]  And don't forget to take your X2 because I have a tendency to forget how great it is and not take it myself.
[05:53.000 --> 05:57.000]  But when I do stamina, libido, energy, weight loss, it's incredible.
[05:57.000 --> 06:00.000]  It's essential. It's X2 at infowarstore.com.
[06:00.000 --> 06:05.000]  It's X2 at infowarstore.com.
[06:30.000 --> 06:56.000]  Welcome back to The Alex Jones Show. We've just kicked off another live transmission.
[06:56.000 --> 07:07.000]  And the information I got before the broadcast started dovetailed with all the major research, scores of top scientists, and other major studies.
[07:07.000 --> 07:19.000]  But when I read the study from an extremely prestigious viral research institute at the University of Texas, Galveston, where they do level 4 bioweapons research,
[07:19.000 --> 07:27.000]  I was completely blown away and quite frankly, had trouble even being on air at this point.
[07:27.000 --> 07:33.000]  This audience is millions of people. You're incredible. You're amazing. But I've learned how the paradox works.
[07:33.000 --> 07:43.000]  If I said I have total proof that they knew that the COVID-19 vaccines, both mRNA and virus vector delivery systems,
[07:43.000 --> 07:52.000]  so both the Moderna, the Pfizer mRNA, and then the AstraZeneca and J&J shots, the two different classes,
[07:52.000 --> 08:03.000]  in the main literature warns that it causes massive autoimmune response in the brain, the heart, and in the cardiovascular system,
[08:03.000 --> 08:08.000]  and that they recommend it not be done because it caused massive death in the lab animals.
[08:08.000 --> 08:15.000]  If I had that info, which I do, and I cover it here on air, it just gets lost in the background noise.
[08:15.000 --> 08:23.000]  But if I built it up and said, oh, this Saturday I'm going to do a special show for three hours commercial-free, everybody tune in,
[08:23.000 --> 08:29.000]  we would have millions and millions of people that tuned in specifically for that information.
[08:29.000 --> 08:36.000]  They would take it very seriously, like they were at a restaurant waiting for a big, nice plate of food to come out,
[08:36.000 --> 08:41.000]  and then they would devour it and then share it with others mentally.
[08:41.000 --> 08:43.000]  And that's basically where we are.
[08:43.000 --> 08:47.000]  Also, this audience is incredibly influential. A lot of important people listen.
[08:47.000 --> 08:55.000]  But this is, at this point, I should probably just go off air and or have Owen Schreuer come in and do a great job hosting
[08:55.000 --> 09:03.000]  and just go show this document, blow up all the different clips in it, show you all the different reports it mentions,
[09:03.000 --> 09:08.000]  and that it links to and then put out a special report.
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.000]  And then I should call up the national talk show host I know and the international talk show host I know and get it to him.
[09:14.000 --> 09:22.000]  Guys, can I please have the Wolfgang Wodarg Dr. Yadon clip from December 1, 2020, please?
[09:22.000 --> 09:27.000]  Can I have that report? It's in two of the stacks in there. I really need that. Thank you.
[09:27.000 --> 09:35.000]  And that's not the report I'm getting at. It's just interesting to note that they listed this study that actually clicked on
[09:35.000 --> 09:51.000]  back in December of last year when I did a report on this and that just now scientists and doctors are looking at the study.
[09:51.000 --> 09:58.000]  So I mean, I know if I just talk about this, nobody cares. But if I build it up, then people will care and we'll be able to stop it.
[09:58.000 --> 10:11.000]  It's a very weird paradox how that works. I mean, this could save hundreds of millions if not millions of people.
[10:11.000 --> 10:22.000]  So I'm unable to continue the broadcast at this point. This is not a drama. I just can't do it. I was already doing too much this morning on other big subjects.
[10:22.000 --> 10:31.000]  And then I got blindsided by this and I'm in a controlled rage right now and I've got to take some time off.
[10:31.000 --> 10:35.000]  So that's just the way it is. I don't know if I'm coming back anymore.
[10:35.000 --> 10:40.000]  Maybe they need to kill everybody because the public doesn't care. Maybe you deserve to die.
[10:40.000 --> 10:50.000]  I mean, seriously, when I look at Trevor Noah and John Oliver and Stephen Colbert going along with this and attacking us and making fun of us.
[10:50.000 --> 10:57.000]  And when I see the talk show house doing it on CNN, Brian Stelter, they're jokes.
[10:57.000 --> 11:05.000]  I don't even wish them bad. They're destroying their own futures too, but they're mercenary followers.
[11:05.000 --> 11:14.000]  And then I see the doctors and the scientists, the majority of them, are going public saying this is horrible and they're being censored by the hundreds of thousands.
[11:14.000 --> 11:21.000]  Every doctor I run into has been censored on Facebook or Twitter for pointing out these studies.
[11:21.000 --> 11:26.000]  Everybody I talk to goes and sees their doctor. I was talking to Shane Stoner the other day.
[11:26.000 --> 11:31.000]  He took his daughter into the doctor because she had a sore throat. They were out of town in Florida.
[11:31.000 --> 11:36.000]  And he goes in and the doctor starts telling him about how COVID is overblown.
[11:36.000 --> 11:40.000]  It's a power grab. And he goes, oh, yeah, you ought to listen to my friend Alex Jones.
[11:40.000 --> 11:49.000]  He goes, Alex Jones, I was just watching him 10 minutes ago with Aaron Russo predict all this in 2010.
[11:49.000 --> 12:00.000]  He actually died in 2007, but the guy saw it in 2010. I guess that was the time stamp on it.
[12:00.000 --> 12:08.000]  And so there's a lot of good things happening, but there's no doubt about this is a mass kill operation.
[12:08.000 --> 12:14.000]  Maybe we should all go protest at Dell Children's Hospital or maybe go protest the FBI in North Austin.
[12:14.000 --> 12:18.000]  I mean, I don't know what you do to draw attention in Bullhorn.
[12:18.000 --> 12:38.000]  But it is the University of Texas prestigious bio weapons research lab saying any vaccines for the coronavirus family cause massive auto immune responses, strokes and heart attacks and blood clots.
[12:38.000 --> 12:42.000]  Look at this. They studied it on a whole bunch of animals.
[12:42.000 --> 12:50.000]  And it killed mass numbers of them. And we've already known this, but this is the University of Texas official laboratory.
[12:50.000 --> 12:54.000]  UT did this in 2012.
[12:54.000 --> 13:01.000]  You know, John Oliver goes, you know, they sped this up in warp speed because they really been studying it for 20 years and knew how safe it was.
[13:01.000 --> 13:05.000]  No dumbass. Every study said it's super deadly.
[13:05.000 --> 13:13.000]  And they went and picked the most super deadly thing they could to inject this with not the virus itself that it's supposed to cure for.
[13:13.000 --> 13:19.000]  But the cure is the disease is the attack massive cardiovascular problems.
[13:19.000 --> 13:26.000]  That's why they got five year olds having heart attacks and dying 15 year olds having heart attacks and dying 20 year olds having strokes and dying.
[13:26.000 --> 13:34.000]  Holy mackerel.
[13:34.000 --> 13:37.000]  You know what, I'm not going to go off air.
[13:37.000 --> 13:42.000]  I'm just going to read the whole damn study on air. How's that sound?
[13:42.000 --> 13:45.000]  And again,
[13:45.000 --> 13:52.000]  music, these studies meant words and this spells it right out in the summary on the front page.
[13:52.000 --> 13:58.000]  University of Texas level four bio weapons lab in Galveston, Texas.
[13:58.000 --> 14:00.000]  One of the biggest in the world.
[14:00.000 --> 14:08.000]  Right down the road from where I'm at. I can be there in three and a half hours driving in a car.
[14:08.000 --> 14:16.000]  And they say, we say you shouldn't use these vaccines and that if you do, you proceed with extreme caution.
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.000]  They didn't do the animal studies that already done them before and they didn't do the human studies.
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.000]  They went directly to open air where you can't ever track or tell what happened on purpose.
[14:24.000 --> 14:30.000]  And if it hits your cardiovascular, some of the rats died today.
[14:30.000 --> 14:33.000]  Some died in six weeks, but they died.
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.000]  And they bled out, folks, where their brain meets the sinus.
[14:38.000 --> 14:42.000]  They bled out in their lungs. They bled out in their hearts. They bled out in their thighs.
[14:42.000 --> 14:48.000]  They bled out in their stomachs. They bled out. They bled out. They bled out. They bled out.
[14:48.000 --> 14:53.000]  They bled out. They bled out. Just like you shoot somebody with a 12 gauge shotgun with double hot buck.
[14:53.000 --> 14:55.000]  They bled out in about a minute.
[14:55.000 --> 14:59.000]  This way you bleed out over the next few years. My God.
[14:59.000 --> 15:02.000]  And you know why you bleed out?
[15:02.000 --> 15:06.000]  Because your body eats a hole in your brain or your heart.
[15:06.000 --> 15:08.000]  Wow.
[15:08.000 --> 15:12.000]  You ever seen white blood cells? That's why you get pus. You get a cut.
[15:12.000 --> 15:15.000]  All of a sudden it kind of swells up, gets some pus when it starts healing.
[15:15.000 --> 15:17.000]  That's why blood cells eating everything.
[15:17.000 --> 15:21.000]  Eating the dead flesh, eating the bacteria, eating the viruses.
[15:21.000 --> 15:26.000]  How do you think it feels when they start eating on your brain, eating on your liver,
[15:26.000 --> 15:30.000]  eating on your heart, eating on your lungs, eating on your arteries?
[15:30.000 --> 15:33.000]  Think that feels real good?
[15:33.000 --> 15:37.000]  That's a piece of garbage bill gates burning hell, you bastard.
[15:37.000 --> 15:42.000]  My God, they really did it. They really freaking lost it.
[15:42.000 --> 15:44.000]  And they knew it when they did it.
[15:44.000 --> 15:49.000]  Because the head of the biology department back in 2012 was Dr. Piazza.
[15:49.000 --> 15:52.000]  All for global extermination of all humans on earth.
[15:52.000 --> 15:58.000]  And now they've launched the first salvo of total death.
[15:58.000 --> 16:02.000]  14 months ago, I began to see on the broadcast every day,
[16:02.000 --> 16:05.000]  when the first world collapses, the third world dies.
[16:05.000 --> 16:09.000]  We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts
[16:09.000 --> 16:13.000]  that when you shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction
[16:13.000 --> 16:17.000]  that will devastate the third world and really hurt the first world.
[16:17.000 --> 16:20.000]  Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States.
[16:20.000 --> 16:23.000]  And that's because the companies and the systems and the drivers
[16:23.000 --> 16:27.000]  that could barely get the job done before delivering gas had been shut down.
[16:27.000 --> 16:30.000]  Plus, the Keystone Pipeline's been shut down on one of the other pipelines.
[16:30.000 --> 16:34.000]  The left is now blowing up dams across the U.S.
[16:34.000 --> 16:37.000]  We're being shut down. Our coal power plants are off as well.
[16:37.000 --> 16:40.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave.
[16:40.000 --> 16:43.000]  The third world is imploding as well. The borders have been removed.
[16:43.000 --> 16:48.000]  Until you wake up, and this is a globalist chai-com takeover, Gregory said, you have no hope.
[16:48.000 --> 16:53.000]  They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds of the gas needed this summer.
[16:53.000 --> 16:56.000]  So they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another
[16:56.000 --> 16:59.000]  and CNN laughed at you and your family.
[16:59.000 --> 17:02.000]  The equation is very simple.
[17:02.000 --> 17:06.000]  The mega banks control the media. They control big pharma.
[17:06.000 --> 17:11.000]  They control academia. They control the military, industrial complex.
[17:11.000 --> 17:13.000]  They control big tech.
[17:13.000 --> 17:18.000]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, the Himalayas.
[17:18.000 --> 17:22.000]  Absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[17:22.000 --> 17:27.000]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery
[17:27.000 --> 17:31.000]  and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[17:31.000 --> 17:36.000]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic, they instead co-opted,
[17:36.000 --> 17:42.000]  brought it down and used the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom
[17:42.000 --> 17:46.000]  and the free market that threatens their monopolies of control.
[17:46.000 --> 17:51.000]  That's why they target info wars, because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[17:51.000 --> 17:56.000]  But the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video.
[17:56.000 --> 18:07.000]  So we double your efforts. We're all in this together.
[18:26.000 --> 18:34.000]  All these people got violently ill. Some died after they took the Franken-shot,
[18:34.000 --> 18:39.000]  the genetic, pre-engineered, experimental injections.
[18:39.000 --> 18:44.000]  Thank you so much for joining us on this May 6, Thursday live transmission.
[18:44.000 --> 18:47.000]  And I've got a lot of the original reports.
[18:47.000 --> 18:52.000]  I've got a lot of the original governmental documentation here.
[18:52.000 --> 19:00.000]  But I had seen a link to this study, but I had not read it.
[19:00.000 --> 19:09.000]  I'd seen some of the other studies linking mRNA-style vaccines period to cardiovascular issues.
[19:09.000 --> 19:14.000]  So we've had medical doctors on and virologists and scientists and we've talked about it.
[19:14.000 --> 19:22.000]  But imagine a 2012 highly respected, peer-reviewed University of Texas long-term study
[19:22.000 --> 19:30.000]  on all sorts of different animals finding massive blood clots, brain damage, heart attacks,
[19:30.000 --> 19:41.000]  organ failure, you name it, and cautioning against vaccines for the coronavirus family.
[19:41.000 --> 19:46.000]  And then a coronavirus gets out of a bio weapons lab, obviously released, look at the timing.
[19:46.000 --> 19:50.000]  They blame it on America. It's used to lock us down.
[19:50.000 --> 19:58.000]  It's used to starve the third world record low birth numbers because people aren't getting together.
[19:58.000 --> 20:04.000]  Depopulation explosion. And it's run by the guy that says he wants to depopulate us
[20:04.000 --> 20:08.000]  who with his dad ran a global depopulation group.
[20:08.000 --> 20:18.000]  And his real name of his foundation is the Global Depopulation Fund.
[20:18.000 --> 20:25.000]  Look at these headlines. Don't vaccinate the young and healthy Swedish doctors
[20:25.000 --> 20:38.000]  with an open letter against mass jabs. Over 28 medical experts. Look at this.
[20:38.000 --> 20:42.000]  Woman dies after getting J&J vaccine reported to CDC.
[20:42.000 --> 20:49.000]  Family says she died a few days after getting it from, you guessed it, blood clots.
[20:49.000 --> 20:56.000]  COVID-19 vaccines designed to elicit neutralizing antibodies may sensitize vaccine recipients
[20:56.000 --> 21:00.000]  to more severe diseases than if they were not vaccinated.
[21:00.000 --> 21:04.000]  It's not just an autoimmune response where you attack yourself.
[21:04.000 --> 21:10.000]  It's a bunch of other stuff. I mean, this is folks, the vaccine creates an autoimmune response
[21:10.000 --> 21:17.000]  to what is already all over your body, a very common protein.
[21:17.000 --> 21:19.000]  And they knew it. That's why they chose this.
[21:19.000 --> 21:23.000]  But see, if they give you a polio vaccine and it has live polio, you get polio.
[21:23.000 --> 21:27.000]  Gates got caught many times and kicked out of a bunch of countries. That's too obvious.
[21:27.000 --> 21:31.000]  You put a female hormone in a tetanus shot so the body has an autoimmune response
[21:31.000 --> 21:34.000]  to a female hormone that kicks in during second trimester.
[21:34.000 --> 21:37.000]  Well, now the body has an autoimmune response against the baby every time.
[21:37.000 --> 21:41.000]  You have a violent miscarriage. Ends up killing the woman a lot of times, too.
[21:41.000 --> 21:47.000]  It's their uterus. That's a little obvious they got caught doing that thing you did on record in the 90s.
[21:47.000 --> 21:52.000]  But if you give somebody something that just keeps replicating in the body
[21:52.000 --> 21:58.000]  and takes over this mitochondria and has your body recognize this protein as outside
[21:58.000 --> 22:03.000]  and it's not good because they put this lipid of antifreeze around it,
[22:03.000 --> 22:07.000]  they put antifreeze around it, quote, to get it into the cell,
[22:07.000 --> 22:09.000]  but that's not really what's happening.
[22:09.000 --> 22:14.000]  So the body sees that from an outside force with a normal protein
[22:14.000 --> 22:17.000]  and now has an autoimmune response to the protein.
[22:17.000 --> 22:25.000]  The evil of this is just staggering. And here's the University of Texas study.
[22:25.000 --> 22:36.000]  Immunization with SARS coronavirus vaccines leads to pulmonary immunopathology
[22:36.000 --> 22:45.000]  on challenge with the SARS virus.
[22:45.000 --> 22:47.000]  Such an incredible report.
[22:47.000 --> 22:56.000]  The conclusion, the SARS COVID vaccine all include antibody and protection against infection with SARS COVID.
[22:56.000 --> 23:07.000]  However, challenge of mice given any of the vaccines led to occurrence of TH2 type immunopathology.
[23:07.000 --> 23:10.000]  Did you hear that?
[23:10.000 --> 23:12.000]  Read that again.
[23:12.000 --> 23:20.000]  The SARS COVID vaccines all induced antibody and protection against infection from SARS COVID.
[23:20.000 --> 23:32.000]  However, challenge of mice given any of the vaccines led to occurrence of the TH2 type immunopathology
[23:32.000 --> 23:39.000]  suggesting hypersensitivity to SARS COVID components was induced.
[23:39.000 --> 23:49.000]  Caution in proceeding to application of SARS COVID vaccine in humans is indicated.
[23:49.000 --> 23:57.000]  Now, when you actually read the report, holy mackerel.
[23:57.000 --> 24:02.000]  You ought to read here, overhead shot please, what happened to the mice.
[24:02.000 --> 24:13.000]  Bleeding out their sinus, bleeding out their brains, bleeding out their heart, young mice, middle-aged mice, old mice, all the mice.
[24:13.000 --> 24:21.000]  The lungs being eaten.
[24:21.000 --> 24:25.000]  Neutralizing antibody assays.
[24:25.000 --> 24:28.000]  What happened to the animals?
[24:28.000 --> 24:31.000]  Death.
[24:31.000 --> 24:35.000]  University of Texas, this is prestigious.
[24:35.000 --> 24:42.000]  This is the university did a long-term study on a bunch of vaccines they already have on the shelf.
[24:42.000 --> 24:50.000]  And they all do the same thing, mRNA or virus vector.
[24:50.000 --> 24:56.000]  They've even got cross sections of the tissue of the poor little mice and how they got eaten up.
[24:56.000 --> 25:01.000]  And the holes that got eaten up.
[25:01.000 --> 25:06.000]  Your body killing you.
[25:06.000 --> 25:10.000]  And they think the public so stupid.
[25:10.000 --> 25:13.000]  They're going to be able to cover all this up.
[25:13.000 --> 25:22.000]  Definition of MO pathology, immunopathology, a branch of medicine that deals with immune response association with disease.
[25:22.000 --> 25:26.000]  And you heard them with all the vaccines they tested.
[25:26.000 --> 25:32.000]  It fried the mice.
[25:32.000 --> 25:40.000]  And form consent disclosure to vaccine trial subjects of risk of COVID-19 vaccines worsening clinical diseases.
[25:40.000 --> 25:48.000]  I got a whole nother big study here that we'll be getting to.
[25:48.000 --> 25:52.000]  Isn't that just incredible?
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.000]  I am poleaxed at this point.
[25:54.000 --> 26:01.000]  I am like been hit in the head because I already spent three days at a time I didn't have back in December.
[26:01.000 --> 26:10.000]  Reading this whole thick report by Wolfgang Wudar and Dr. Yedon, Dr. Wudar and Dr. Yedon, both at the highest procedures level there is.
[26:10.000 --> 26:15.000]  Saying this will cause autoimmune diseases, strokes, heart attacks. Please don't do it.
[26:15.000 --> 26:17.000]  Of course, everything they said happened.
[26:17.000 --> 26:20.000]  But they link to this study actually in here.
[26:20.000 --> 26:23.000]  I remember looking at it and just reading so much.
[26:23.000 --> 26:29.000]  I just glazed over it and they got a bunch of other studies showing that they already tried to get these things approved before.
[26:29.000 --> 26:32.000]  Why they never have a vaccine for the Corona family?
[26:32.000 --> 26:34.000]  That's the most common one of the most common families.
[26:34.000 --> 26:42.000]  Because it's a fricking protein that your body's made up out of.
[26:42.000 --> 26:43.000]  It's incredible.
[26:43.000 --> 26:47.000]  And I've got some, I was so ready to cover all this other news.
[26:47.000 --> 26:48.000]  Oh my gosh.
[26:48.000 --> 26:54.000]  I just spent last night this morning reading 50-something pages of a Pentagon DARPA document.
[26:54.000 --> 27:00.000]  I mean, the world is awakening.
[27:00.000 --> 27:03.000]  The world is beginning to understand the globalist paradigm.
[27:03.000 --> 27:14.000]  They are discovering the globalist, the elites, the manipulation, the CFR, the trilateral commission, the Bilderberg group, the Bohemian Grove, the Club of Rome.
[27:14.000 --> 27:23.000]  And so, even though it seems like the globalists are winning, the truth is they've had to come out in the open to attack human freedom
[27:23.000 --> 27:25.000]  because they're actually losing.
[27:25.000 --> 27:28.000]  We have forced them out in the open.
[27:28.000 --> 27:32.000]  So as bad as these times are, a lot of negative things are about to happen.
[27:32.000 --> 27:34.000]  Realize humanity is winning.
[27:34.000 --> 27:39.000]  You've got to trust in the plan of God and trust in the plan of God's justice.
[27:39.000 --> 27:40.000]  That is invincible.
[27:40.000 --> 27:44.000]  That is ethereal, timeless, and unstoppable.
[27:44.000 --> 27:50.000]  So don't trust in man, trust in God, to lead God and direct your soul, and then take action against the globalists.
[27:50.000 --> 27:53.000]  You've got my commitment from Alex Jones and my crew to you.
[27:53.000 --> 27:58.000]  We will never back down from the globalists, and we will never surrender.
[27:58.000 --> 28:05.000]  When listeners call to the show and thank me for all I've done, I always stop them and I say thank you for what you've done.
[28:05.000 --> 28:07.000]  Thank you for keeping InfoWars on the air.
[28:07.000 --> 28:10.000]  Thank you for praying for us, and thank you for spreading the word.
[28:10.000 --> 28:19.000]  If all of you will simply go to InfoWarsStore.com and get a privacy pocket for your iPhone or Droid, it will teach you and others.
[28:19.000 --> 28:21.000]  That these things are surveilling you.
[28:21.000 --> 28:27.000]  It will remind you every day, like it does me and my family, and it will protect where you go and what you do.
[28:27.000 --> 28:33.000]  Not because you've done something wrong, but because the big telecoms, big tech, and the globalists are predatory and are evil.
[28:33.000 --> 28:39.000]  And in the surveillance state, we need to more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in.
[28:39.000 --> 28:42.000]  These are the highest quality, highest ratings.
[28:42.000 --> 28:47.000]  They're available at InfoWarsStore.com in four different colors, and they are only $19.95.
[28:47.000 --> 28:51.000]  The exact same pocket is sold for $24.95, or even $29.95 everywhere.
[28:51.000 --> 28:54.000]  They're available right now for $19.95, and they fund the InfoWars.
[28:54.000 --> 28:58.000]  Please take action today, protect your privacy, and fund the InfoWars.
[28:58.000 --> 29:07.000]  This entire new world order system is about making you dependent, making you obsolete, making you a domesticated animal they control.
[29:07.000 --> 29:14.000]  They want to censor you, they want to dumb you down, they want to poison you, and they want to control your ability to take care of yourself.
[29:14.000 --> 29:24.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, now is the time to fund the InfoWars more than ever, and you can do it while at the same time protecting yourself and your family and your neighbors.
[29:24.000 --> 29:35.000]  We have the biggest, best storeable foods company in the world that has high quality food in huge warehouses across the U.S., five of them, ready to ship to you within 24 hours.
[29:35.000 --> 29:45.000]  And when you go to infowarsstore.com to get to my Patriot supply food, you get an additional 10% off. That is the lowest price you're going to find anywhere on quality food.

[29:58.000 --> 30:06.000]  The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non-consenting patients.
[30:06.000 --> 30:19.000]  Hundreds of hospitals in the U.S. injected healthy men, women, and children with uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non-therapeutic to lethal, killing many of the test subjects.
[30:19.000 --> 30:30.000]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement is one of the most important films ever made. 14 years ago, we tracked and documented the Bilderberg Group's activities and their plan for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus.
[30:30.000 --> 30:39.000]  The film now is more important than ever. When it's shot to number one on Amazon last year, they banned it. We have it back in print available now at infowarsstore.com.
[30:39.000 --> 30:49.000]  Selling them as low as $3.95 a piece of the environment bulk. And there's a zero country code. So anywhere on the planet, you can make copies. In fact, I want you to make copies. You are the Paul Revere's.
[30:49.000 --> 31:10.000]  In-game blueprint for global enslavement available now at infowarsstore.com.
[31:10.000 --> 31:38.000]  Feel my Frankenstein.
[31:38.000 --> 32:03.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this live Thursday transmission. Here's what I'm going to do.
[32:03.000 --> 32:19.000]  I'm going to settle down and I'm going to take all of this vaccine tyranny, global government, forced inoculation, forced quarantine, forced segregation of the population news,
[32:19.000 --> 32:40.000]  seeing and saying bully your neighbors and family and taking the vaccine, total intimidation, total evil, University of Texas, scientific reports saying they tested three different coronavirus COVID vaccines nine years ago
[32:40.000 --> 32:55.000]  and that they caused autoimmune responses of the lungs and heart and brain being eaten by the body. I'm going to take this stack
[32:55.000 --> 33:17.000]  and I'm going to put it up until next hour because I'm like a deer in the headlights here. I mean, I know you are as well. And they think that we're all just going to put up with this.
[33:17.000 --> 33:25.000]  You know, if a robber comes to your house and breaks into your back door, you know what to do. Or if you're in a parking lot and somebody tries to mug you, you either fight back or you submit.
[33:25.000 --> 33:33.000]  But what do you do when it's the medical system? And you get their own documents and they admit this is deadly, this is wrong, it doesn't protect you.
[33:33.000 --> 33:50.000]  They lie about everything they've done with SARS and COVID-19. They war game it all out and they're taking over and putting us under martial law and bankrupting small businesses and farms and admitting it to take over plan.
[33:50.000 --> 34:03.000]  And they've got all these people who are learned helplessness Stockholm syndrome victims serving their oppressors and they're telling those zombies to come get in our faces because we're not drinking the Kool-Aid.
[34:03.000 --> 34:14.000]  But if you look at history, there's always groups that make big authoritarian moves. And each time evil has a new science, a new technology, the Blitzkrieg, whatever they want to call it, that they're going to use to win.
[34:14.000 --> 34:20.000]  And good always gets caught with its pants down, but in the end wins.
[34:20.000 --> 34:29.000]  The question is how many billions of people are going to die this time? They're making a run at us. They're going for the full depopulation now.
[34:29.000 --> 34:45.000]  And I told you the rat studies, the mice studies, the ferret studies with regular mRNA or regular virus vector, regular attenuated virus, whole virus vaccines, what they call it.
[34:45.000 --> 34:55.000]  I mean, we're talking 100% death rates in many of the studies and the other studies, it's all more than 50% die an early death.
[34:55.000 --> 35:00.000]  Wow. Wow. I mean, just wow.
[35:00.000 --> 35:10.000]  I feel like I should just go get on my knees at a church. But those churches are full of little world council churches, Rockefeller approved non-preachers. They're taking everything over.
[35:10.000 --> 35:17.000]  I mean, this is the end of the world stuff, folks.
[35:17.000 --> 35:30.000]  It's absolute confirmation that these people are psychotic murderers. And then if we don't do something about it, we're aiding and abetting them.
[35:30.000 --> 35:50.000]  And then it makes me want to just get back to my family and run to the hills. I mean, not even out of fear. It just at a cellular level, it feels like it's wrong to not run to the most remote area possible and just get away from this.
[35:50.000 --> 35:53.000]  That's a normal response.
[35:53.000 --> 36:03.000]  The pilgrims left the tyranny of England to try to have freedom and, of course, set up one of their own. That's the way the world works. But it's the idea that counts.
[36:03.000 --> 36:12.000]  And so I'm not choking. I never choke in front of a big crowd. I never choke on air. I don't get butterflies being on air. But I am during the headlights at this point.
[36:12.000 --> 36:24.000]  You know, I probably should just open the phones up and ask listeners, what do we do? How do we respond to this? How do you respond to this? Let me do this then.
[36:24.000 --> 36:33.000]  I'm going to open the phones up. So let's get the great John Harmon in here. My producer of 18 years, who's a great call screener. And by that, we don't screen for your content.
[36:33.000 --> 36:50.000]  We screen for quality phone line and that you're able to talk, which is all our great listeners. But get him in there, please, or because I want to open the phones up specifically for medical workers, doctors, nurses.
[36:50.000 --> 37:01.000]  If you're a janitor, works in a hospital and you've seen suspicious stuff, or you think the vaccine is great, we don't screen your calls for content. We screen your calls for phone quality.
[37:01.000 --> 37:13.000]  And that you're ready to make a point. I want to hear from medical doctors. I want to hear from research scientists specifically that are working on this, nurses, doctors, people that work in nursing homes.
[37:13.000 --> 37:30.000]  I want to hear from you. Or if you had a direct relation, mother, father, son, daughter, who had a wonderful effect from these franken shots, or tell us the effect you had.
[37:30.000 --> 37:49.000]  877-789-2539-877-789. Alex, 877-789-2539, and we will start taking your calls next hour, maybe even sooner, but I want to get the phones loaded up at 877-789-2539.
[37:49.000 --> 38:00.000]  And this is what's happened, because here's the deal. I knew this was all coming forever, but it was in beta, but now all these different projects and globalist plans are coming together.
[38:00.000 --> 38:15.000]  And then I even read, this is a giant report that's excellent, that is 42 pages long, 30 plus pages of it is DARPA reports.
[38:15.000 --> 38:22.000]  That's the group that the scientific dictatorship that runs it all. That's the eugenesis, that's the death cult.
[38:22.000 --> 38:34.000]  That created the CIA, the NSA, all of it. And they actually say they're number one enemies of the American people and that they're going to take over and that white people are bad.
[38:34.000 --> 38:45.000]  I mean, of course, this didn't come out of black people's brains or white people's brains down the street. It came out of the big scientific system. It's the mainstream media. It's the corporations. It's the universities.
[38:45.000 --> 38:53.000]  It's the establishment wants to divide and conquer. They want us divided before they slaughter all of us. Black, white, they don't care.
[38:53.000 --> 39:02.000]  This report is mind blowing, because we know that they're purging the military and doing litmus tests. That's admitted.
[39:02.000 --> 39:07.000]  But the guy they've got as their front guy is just the front man.
[39:07.000 --> 39:17.000]  A DARPA report got leaked out, which they admits a real DARPA report that he's following, and it is the end of the human military and the end of human intelligence, human.
[39:17.000 --> 39:23.000]  And for the machine takeover, this is just a DARPA sabotage of human biological systems.
[39:23.000 --> 39:28.000]  So we're so dysfunctional that once things collapse, they'll bring in total AI that directs all human activity.
[39:28.000 --> 39:32.000]  The first thing to make is dysfunctional before they bring that system in.
[39:32.000 --> 39:36.000]  And it's all right there, and it's just incredible.
[39:36.000 --> 39:41.000]  So I'm going to cover that next segment and just all the other incredible stuff.
[39:41.000 --> 39:46.000]  More welfare, more farm aid, more everything for minorities instead of white people.
[39:46.000 --> 39:53.000]  I mean, total racism on its face, beginning as used to fighting over the socialist crumbs like Venezuela.
[39:53.000 --> 40:00.000]  That's coming up, massive censorship news coming up, huge financial news.
[40:00.000 --> 40:04.000]  There is just so much here today.
[40:04.000 --> 40:18.000]  So medical doctors, scientists, specifically on what we just covered for the University of Texas report and all the others about the protein in coronaviruses being all over the human body.
[40:18.000 --> 40:26.000]  And this is the equivalent of creating, you know, a vaccine that makes you attack water and then it would attack your whole body.
[40:26.000 --> 40:30.000]  I mean, it's absolutely over the top.
[40:30.000 --> 40:33.000]  Yeah, print me that report too, yeah.
[40:33.000 --> 40:36.000]  COVID-19 and Alzheimer's, that's a study.
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  Oh, but John Albers said I made it up.
[40:38.000 --> 40:39.000]  He's a good man.
[40:39.000 --> 40:45.000]  I just show you, read it to you, on air, where it's from, prestigious, but it's okay.
[40:45.000 --> 40:54.000]  We got a comedian. He's got a cockney accent like he's, you know, unloading stolen loot at the London War.
[40:54.000 --> 40:58.000]  We'll be right back. Stay with us.
[40:58.000 --> 41:04.000]  Serving with Info Wars is a great honor, but I still need my morning coffee.
[41:04.000 --> 41:14.000]  And luckily, our break room at the Info Wars headquarters is stock full of high quality, Info War store, Patriot blend coffee.
[41:14.000 --> 41:26.000]  Grown in the high mountains of southern Mexico, the Chiapas farmers grow 100% organic non-GMO coffee at the ideal altitude for the perfect cup.
[41:26.000 --> 41:31.000]  A robust coffee with great flavor and mild acidity.
[41:31.000 --> 41:35.000]  There has never been a more important time to support Info Wars.
[41:35.000 --> 41:42.000]  So if you love coffee and if you want to fight for freedom, then you can help.

[42:59.000 --> 43:08.000]  Listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so saying, where are most of the best selling products you have that we love?
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  And my answer is the supply chain has broken down.
[43:10.000 --> 43:14.000]  I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot of these.
[43:14.000 --> 43:17.000]  And so that's why we don't have a lot of products in.
[43:17.000 --> 43:21.000]  That's why info wars is in financial trouble is because if we had the product, you would be buying it.
[43:21.000 --> 43:24.000]  We have the money, but so many of them have been sold out.
[43:24.000 --> 43:30.000]  Just like you noticed, a lot of other items at the store aren't available because civilization is being artificially imploded.
[43:30.000 --> 43:33.000]  But finally, X2 is back in stock.
[43:33.000 --> 43:37.000]  The good halogen, deep earth crystal iodine, so essential in your body.
[43:37.000 --> 43:38.000]  It's really the missing link.
[43:38.000 --> 43:40.000]  It's 50% off.
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  We've got a big shipment of it at infowarstore.com.
[43:42.000 --> 43:47.000]  Now when it gets ready to sell out, we'll have to go back to near full price, take advantage of this now, stock up.
[43:47.000 --> 43:52.000]  And don't forget to take your X2 because I have a tendency to forget how great it is and not take it myself.
[43:52.000 --> 43:56.000]  But when I do stamina, libido, energy, weight loss, it's incredible.
[43:56.000 --> 43:57.000]  It's essential.
[43:57.000 --> 43:59.000]  It's X2 at infowarstore.com.
[43:59.000 --> 44:02.000]  I am a very humble person, but I'm also a bold person.
[44:02.000 --> 44:07.000]  And so as bad as things are with the globalist attack of humanity, with all the terrible things that are unfolding,
[44:07.000 --> 44:12.000]  I want you to know that a lot of positive things are happening as well.
[44:12.000 --> 44:16.000]  I'm a public figure, so I get to see things zero public doesn't get to see.
[44:16.000 --> 44:24.000]  And let me tell you, whether it's police chiefs or members of Congress or even folks in Hollywood or mainstream media or industry,
[44:24.000 --> 44:28.000]  people are really, really awake in the establishment.
[44:28.000 --> 44:31.000]  They don't want to go along with the globalist, but they're scared.
[44:31.000 --> 44:33.000]  They're looking for leadership.
[44:33.000 --> 44:35.000]  Well, that's where infowar comes in.
[44:35.000 --> 44:36.000]  You fund us.
[44:36.000 --> 44:37.000]  You support infowarstore.com.
[44:37.000 --> 44:39.000]  You get great policy at the same time.
[44:39.000 --> 44:43.000]  We will then go out and do what the globalist says unpopular,
[44:43.000 --> 44:49.000]  what the globalist will target you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[44:49.000 --> 44:54.000]  That's our job, so please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire,
[44:54.000 --> 44:57.000]  so we can meet the shock groups for the information war.
[44:57.000 --> 45:13.000]  Fund us at infowarstore.com.
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.000]  Money through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. Central.
[45:30.000 --> 45:33.000]  We are here live, and I'm going to show you your host.
[45:33.000 --> 45:40.000]  So let me just show you what's in the news stack today to give you an example of who's behind this, the power structure of the system.
[45:40.000 --> 45:47.000]  We have Carol Baker, CDC spokeswoman, telling a giant amphitheater full of scientists and doctors and nurses
[45:47.000 --> 45:52.000]  that white people are inherently bad and must be gotten rid of because they don't submit to the government.
[45:52.000 --> 45:59.000]  So that's where this is coming from, and I guess we do have kind of an Irish, Scottish, English background of a thousand years of war
[45:59.000 --> 46:06.000]  between those groups and kings trying to get freedom, and that's where the Magna Carta and then juries and basic rights come from.
[46:06.000 --> 46:14.000]  Yes, what white people basically invented really, really angers the other white people that want to run things.
[46:14.000 --> 46:22.000]  So let's continue. Report, Biden relief prioritizes funds for non-white business owners.
[46:22.000 --> 46:27.000]  Well, I mean, it's dangerous for the government to order you to shut down and then say, now I'm going to give you money,
[46:27.000 --> 46:31.000]  which is usually about 10% of what you actually need to be made whole.
[46:31.000 --> 46:35.000]  Plus, if you value the currency, nothing's for free, which is already happening.
[46:35.000 --> 46:39.000]  You see inflation really accelerating out to frightening levels.
[46:39.000 --> 46:43.000]  It's going to get really scary the next six months, but that's a side issue.
[46:43.000 --> 46:50.000]  Imagine a Martin Luther King said, and we're going to give the brown people a better shot than the white people.
[46:50.000 --> 46:54.000]  Well, you argue that's affirmative action, but then it goes to like a newborn white baby.
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  What have they done?
[46:56.000 --> 46:58.000]  And I mean, blacks ran slavery too.
[46:58.000 --> 47:04.000]  So because a black person might have had a great, great, great, great, great, great, great grandfather that helped sell black slaves to slavers,
[47:04.000 --> 47:06.000]  both black slavers, Arab slavers and white slavers.
[47:06.000 --> 47:09.000]  I mean, is he to blame? Of course not.
[47:09.000 --> 47:16.000]  But that's an authoritarian idea that you're guilty of what your ancestors did, but it continues.
[47:16.000 --> 47:27.000]  Disabled farmers sues by administration for racist land reform provision saying we're going to get more money to blacks to get land than white people in loans
[47:27.000 --> 47:35.000]  and other different federal aid packages or laws that, you know, farmers get in aid packages.
[47:35.000 --> 47:41.000]  New Jersey police officer fired for calling BLM protesters terrorists.
[47:41.000 --> 47:47.000]  Rock climbing classes designed for students of color are designed for them.
[47:47.000 --> 47:52.000]  School draws racist accusations because whites aren't allowed.
[47:52.000 --> 47:55.000]  Wow. How is it designed for blacks?
[47:55.000 --> 47:58.000]  Oh, because blacks are different.
[47:58.000 --> 48:01.000]  Think about this, ladies and gentlemen.
[48:01.000 --> 48:05.000]  And this is the power structure wanting to own and control groups of people.
[48:05.000 --> 48:07.000]  It's slavery.
[48:07.000 --> 48:09.000]  Think about how serious this is.
[48:09.000 --> 48:18.000]  Meanwhile, national cop lured into ambush by Islamists, shot in critical condition, but that's okay because he's white.
[48:18.000 --> 48:19.000]  Now enter this guy.
[48:19.000 --> 48:26.000]  I'm not going to play clips of him on MSNBC and CNN saying white's inherently evil in America's the worst country on earth and the country doesn't need to exist.
[48:26.000 --> 48:32.000]  It's all in the report by Revolver News.
[48:32.000 --> 48:39.000]  Check out this story because it will blow you away.
[48:39.000 --> 48:42.000]  It's totally insane.
[48:42.000 --> 48:50.000]  You've seen how the whole Pentagon system is being set up.
[48:50.000 --> 48:59.000]  And for some reason this printed without the headline, and so I read the whole thing basically, but I don't have the headline, but we're going to pull it up for you and see it for TV viewers.
[48:59.000 --> 49:08.000]  And it's a huge Revolver News article about Bishop Garrison and the headline was something like this.
[49:08.000 --> 49:12.000]  You've heard about the Pentagon's diversity czar.
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  Well, it's worse than you think.
[49:14.000 --> 49:15.000]  There it is.
[49:15.000 --> 49:21.000]  You've heard about Bishop Garrison, the Pentagon's hatchet man in charge of putting just third times of charm.
[49:21.000 --> 49:23.000]  Just go ahead and try it again.
[49:23.000 --> 49:34.000]  Meet Bishop Garrison, the Pentagon's hatchet man in charge of purging, make America great again, patriots and installing race theory in the military.
[49:34.000 --> 49:44.000]  And then when you read this thing for yourself, what's incredible is not that he's white's inherently evil and he's a black supremacist.
[49:44.000 --> 49:48.000]  He's a black supremacist and a black KKK member, but with power.
[49:48.000 --> 49:58.000]  Bishop Garrison is the advisor of the Secretary of Defense, Austin, who also is a black supremacist.
[49:58.000 --> 50:01.000]  That's why it was put there to create division.
[50:01.000 --> 50:07.000]  And they've got all the quotes from the DARPA report that's now been made public.
[50:07.000 --> 50:25.000]  And it says right here in the DARPA report that the core ideology of patriot extremism, which they list as terrorism, is the ideology holds that the U.S. government has become corrupt, has overstepped its constitutional boundaries.
[50:25.000 --> 50:29.000]  That is a measured, common sense statement that's true.
[50:29.000 --> 50:41.000]  And it goes on to say what you saw in that report we covered yesterday, put up a bill on the gates, that we should use the Pentagon and the CIA and cyber command against vaccine deniers, or COVID deniers.
[50:41.000 --> 50:48.000]  And what you saw Biden say, if you don't like me, you're a white supremacist, and that's illegal, that's terrorism, we're going to use the Pentagon on you.
[50:48.000 --> 50:52.000]  And the CIA ads they're running are all about getting the white people.
[50:52.000 --> 50:55.000]  So this is how they plan to gut this country is with race war.
[50:55.000 --> 50:59.000]  It is a foreign multinational banking cartel that's doing it.
[50:59.000 --> 51:01.000]  Communist China is doing it.
[51:01.000 --> 51:02.000]  They shut us down.
[51:02.000 --> 51:03.000]  They lock us down.
[51:03.000 --> 51:04.000]  They do this.
[51:04.000 --> 51:06.000]  They get us all dependent and they say, oh, we're not going to help the white people.
[51:06.000 --> 51:07.000]  They're bad.
[51:07.000 --> 51:14.000]  We're only going to help the brown people, which makes white people become hateful of brown people and brown people become hateful of white people.
[51:14.000 --> 51:16.000]  And it's the classic that Biden conquered.
[51:16.000 --> 51:28.000]  This is so cynical, so evil is the definition of not just racism, but of tribal balkanization, which is the way empires control countries they've conquered or peoples they've conquered.
[51:28.000 --> 51:29.000]  It is so cynical.
[51:29.000 --> 51:30.000]  It is so bad.
[51:30.000 --> 51:33.000]  You've got to go read this report for yourself.
[51:33.000 --> 51:36.000]  I mean, words cannot describe it.
[51:36.000 --> 51:40.000]  In fact, I'm going to have it posted to info wars.com.
[51:40.000 --> 51:41.000]  It's like 40 something pages long.
[51:41.000 --> 51:43.000]  We're going to post half of it.
[51:43.000 --> 51:45.000]  I'm sure they won't mind and put a link to them to read the whole thing.
[51:45.000 --> 51:47.000]  But this needs to be archived.
[51:47.000 --> 51:48.000]  This needs to be shared.
[51:48.000 --> 51:52.000]  This needs to be supported and revolver is doing a fabulous job.
[51:52.000 --> 52:00.000]  But anybody can go read the leaked DARPA report that, you know, good people are around that they leaked it and DARPA mentions a real report.
[52:00.000 --> 52:04.000]  You've got to see it for yourself.
[52:04.000 --> 52:08.000]  It is a blueprint and a battle plan.
[52:08.000 --> 52:13.000]  But the Pentagon opinion police have a black guy as their front.
[52:13.000 --> 52:15.000]  So they can say, oh, it's a grass root.
[52:15.000 --> 52:16.000]  It's a black guy.
[52:16.000 --> 52:21.000]  No, it is DARPA, the sinister globalist organization.
[52:21.000 --> 52:23.000]  You just saw the latest stuff.
[52:23.000 --> 52:25.000]  Oh, you're a white farmer got flooded.
[52:25.000 --> 52:27.000]  Oh, you're a white farmer crops died.
[52:27.000 --> 52:30.000]  Oh, you don't get the aid relief.
[52:30.000 --> 52:31.000]  You're white.
[52:31.000 --> 52:35.000]  You didn't know you're an old white guy in a wheelchair that's got cancer.
[52:35.000 --> 52:37.000]  And oh, sorry, you can't apply.
[52:37.000 --> 52:46.000]  I mean, if you imagine the resentment that's designed to create.
[52:46.000 --> 52:49.000]  And so that's where all this is going, ladies and gentlemen.
[52:49.000 --> 52:52.000]  I mean, in fact, it's already here.
[52:52.000 --> 52:57.000]  And this is a Marxist Leninist takeover has nothing to do with equity or freedom or coming together.
[52:57.000 --> 53:02.000]  It has everything to do with total and complete abject slavery.
[53:02.000 --> 53:07.000]  All right, Nick Foynchez is going to pop in. He's okay folks, but still on the no fly list.
[53:07.000 --> 53:08.000]  He's filing suit.
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  He's going to pop in last segment of the next hour.
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  I'm going to go to John.
[53:12.000 --> 53:14.000]  Prinzeca or friends.
[53:14.000 --> 53:16.000]  Second my eyes are going out here.
[53:16.000 --> 53:21.000]  Cameron, Athena, James, Nicole, Brian, Beth, Natasha and Rick.
[53:21.000 --> 53:26.000]  As soon as we start the next hour, got some good news for everybody.
[53:26.000 --> 53:27.000]  People love it.
[53:27.000 --> 53:28.000]  It's 10 hour clean energy.
[53:28.000 --> 53:32.000]  With all these great natural ingredients that's supercharged the natural energy that's in it.
[53:32.000 --> 53:35.000]  Five types of time release energy.
[53:35.000 --> 53:37.000]  10 hours of clean energy for the average person.
[53:37.000 --> 53:38.000]  Some people more.
[53:38.000 --> 53:39.000]  Some people less.
[53:39.000 --> 53:45.000]  I can take a quarter bag of it when I'm exhausted at five o'clock and I don't work till midnight on the road.
[53:45.000 --> 53:49.000]  But then come down off of it really, really smooth and good.
[53:49.000 --> 53:54.000]  I do something like a Kava show or something after that or take some magnesium powder but or take rocket rest.
[53:54.000 --> 53:58.000]  But it's back in stock infowarstore.com.

[54:52.000 --> 54:53.000]  They've been suppressing this news.

[55:41.000 --> 55:47.000]  All right, we're going to go to break hour number two of the most devastating COVID news yet.
[55:47.000 --> 55:51.000]  The best product, I'm not supposed to be biased, but I'm going to tell you all now,
[55:51.000 --> 55:53.000]  if you haven't tried Turboforce, you need to try it.
[55:53.000 --> 55:55.000]  I've tried Turboforce with everything.
[55:55.000 --> 55:58.000]  Sometimes, you know, I went a little bit crazy.
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  I put Turboforce in my coffee.
[56:00.000 --> 56:01.000]  That was a crazy week.
[56:01.000 --> 56:04.000]  I don't remember sleeping, but as far as the products go, Turboforce is my favorite.
[56:04.000 --> 56:07.000]  And all the Infowars products are down to taking control of your life,
[56:07.000 --> 56:11.000]  taking control of your health, not relying on other people to do it for you.
[56:11.000 --> 56:15.000]  Nobody wakes up in the morning and thinks,
[56:15.000 --> 56:17.000]  I'm going to give that person over there a better life.
[56:17.000 --> 56:18.000]  I'm going to wake up today.
[56:18.000 --> 56:19.000]  You know what?
[56:19.000 --> 56:23.000]  I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer.
[56:23.000 --> 56:25.000]  I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[56:25.000 --> 56:26.000]  I don't think that happens very often.
[56:26.000 --> 56:27.000]  It's never happened to me.
[56:27.000 --> 56:29.000]  I've never had anyone knock on my door and said,
[56:29.000 --> 56:30.000]  Tate, you're such a good guy.
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  How can I improve your life in every single way?
[56:32.000 --> 56:35.000]  There's only one person who woke up and fought that, and that was me.
[56:35.000 --> 56:36.000]  I woke up and fought.
[56:36.000 --> 56:37.000]  You know what?
[56:37.000 --> 56:38.000]  Okay, I want to take control of my life.
[56:38.000 --> 56:39.000]  I want to take control of my health.
[56:39.000 --> 56:40.000]  And that's why you need to go to infowars.com.
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.000]  Take control of your health right now and support the resistance.
[56:42.000 --> 56:45.000]  Don't buy into the group think, don't drink the Kool-Aid.
[56:45.000 --> 56:46.000]  Drink the Turbo Force.
[56:46.000 --> 57:15.000]  Kool-Aid's bad and the Turbo Force is good.
[57:16.000 --> 57:21.000]  I'm going to make sure you're ready to go to sleep, and I'm going to talk about
[57:21.000 --> 57:26.000]  how to get to sleep, but help you wake up feeling refreshed.
[57:26.000 --> 57:30.000]  Many competitors' sleep formulas focus only on getting you to sleep,
[57:30.000 --> 57:35.000]  but Rocket Rest was specifically formulated to help you feel rested and ready to take
[57:35.000 --> 57:36.000]  on the next day.
[57:36.000 --> 57:41.000]  It uses a unique, quick-release capsule system to ensure fast delivery of deep
[57:41.000 --> 57:44.000]  sleep-support ingredients like melatonin and magnesium.
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  Welcome back to Alex Jones' show.
[57:46.000 --> 58:10.000]  All right, I'm taking your calls for the next 45 minutes.
[58:10.000 --> 58:18.000]  And then we're going to have one of the only Nick Pointes.
[58:18.000 --> 58:22.000]  There's filing suit on the TSA for being on the no-fly list.
[58:22.000 --> 58:23.000]  We're all Nick Pointes now.
[58:23.000 --> 58:25.000]  It's Nick today, us tomorrow.
[58:25.000 --> 58:29.000]  He's popping in, and then I've got a very important special report I shot this morning
[58:29.000 --> 58:34.000]  that is going to premiere here dealing with pedophile rings out in the open.
[58:34.000 --> 58:35.000]  Very important report.
[58:35.000 --> 58:36.000]  I mean, all this stuff.
[58:36.000 --> 58:37.000]  It's the quickening.
[58:37.000 --> 58:40.000]  It's all coming together.
[58:40.000 --> 58:43.000]  The mask is basically 95% off.
[58:43.000 --> 58:44.000]  It's insane.
[58:44.000 --> 58:50.000]  And then Greg Reese is going to be popping in because his report on unmasking
[58:50.000 --> 58:55.000]  and eliminating has really caused a fracas, and that's a good thing.
[58:55.000 --> 58:59.000]  We want to get an open debate about all this stuff, and that's what we want.
[58:59.000 --> 59:04.000]  And so he's going to host a segment in the air as a report, and then Matt Bracken takes
[59:04.000 --> 59:06.000]  over in the fourth hour.
[59:06.000 --> 59:13.000]  I have been called away to a little court hearing today, the Wonders of Family Court.
[59:13.000 --> 59:17.000]  So that's why I take something this morning because I've got to go at one o'clock today,
[59:17.000 --> 59:19.000]  but I'll be back after that this afternoon.
[59:19.000 --> 59:22.000]  There is so much to cover and so much to get to.
[59:22.000 --> 59:25.000]  And we've got loaded phone lines here.
[59:25.000 --> 59:29.000]  John says, daughter and friends had reactions to the vaccines.
[59:29.000 --> 59:33.000]  Francesca is a nurse, works in nursing home, has comments on vaccines.
[59:33.000 --> 59:37.000]  Travis is a medical worker and grandmother had reactions.
[59:37.000 --> 59:41.000]  Athena is a mother-in-law, has heart problems after vaccine.
[59:41.000 --> 59:45.000]  James is in Iowa, pregnant sister had baby, now baby has seizures.
[59:45.000 --> 59:49.000]  Nicole, the Florida husband is a nurse.
[59:49.000 --> 59:52.000]  Mother-in-law took vaccine.
[59:52.000 --> 59:58.000]  Brian is in Pennsylvania, is a nurse, wife is a doc, vaccines and COVID madness.
[59:58.000 --> 1:00:04.000]  And we're getting the other callers, Beth and Natasha and Rick and Nick, exactly what they're calling about.
[1:00:04.000 --> 1:00:08.000]  Mike is a retired medical worker on top of the vaccine and shedding.
[1:00:08.000 --> 1:00:14.000]  We're going to go directly to your calls as soon as we come back because I don't want to cut you short.
[1:00:14.000 --> 1:00:16.000]  I want to make sure we can get right to you.
[1:00:16.000 --> 1:00:22.000]  So just boom, tell your story, tell your point, we will jump to the next person.
[1:00:22.000 --> 1:00:26.000]  And then I've got some good news, and let me just start getting to that now.
[1:00:26.000 --> 1:00:30.000]  Cheney's faced the boot in Washington.
[1:00:30.000 --> 1:00:35.000]  Not just Cheney, but her husband and the whole family and the wife and all of them.
[1:00:35.000 --> 1:00:39.000]  Wyoming hasn't looked much better.
[1:00:39.000 --> 1:00:46.000]  Liz Cheney's fall shows that Trump is here to stay.
[1:00:46.000 --> 1:00:51.000]  So the whole family we're told is like God, like John McCain's family.
[1:00:51.000 --> 1:00:55.000]  The daughter, the mother, all of them, we had to listen to doing everything they say.
[1:00:55.000 --> 1:01:02.000]  But the fact that she has been removed from the leadership is a good thing.
[1:01:02.000 --> 1:01:13.000]  They have polls in her so-called home state where she's a congresswoman where 89% don't like her.
[1:01:13.000 --> 1:01:16.000]  CNN polls have them at 70% don't like her.
[1:01:16.000 --> 1:01:17.000]  She's a joke.
[1:01:17.000 --> 1:01:22.000]  We don't want neocon warmongering tyrants anymore.
[1:01:22.000 --> 1:01:29.000]  We don't want a direct of the Frank Luntz type Republicans that are basically just Democrats masquerading as Republicans.
[1:01:29.000 --> 1:01:30.000]  Democrats that love war.
[1:01:30.000 --> 1:01:32.000]  Well, the Democrats now officially do that too.
[1:01:32.000 --> 1:01:36.000]  So who needs Cheney anymore when you've got Barack Obama and all the rest of them?
[1:01:36.000 --> 1:01:39.000]  So that is a good thing.
[1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:42.000]  And people are like, oh my gosh, Trump is so powerful.
[1:01:42.000 --> 1:01:46.000]  Everybody he endorses wins by giant margins and special elections.
[1:01:46.000 --> 1:01:53.000]  Yes, that's why we need to be supportive of Trump to stay political, to stay engaged, to stay involved,
[1:01:53.000 --> 1:02:01.000]  because they're trying to indict his inner circle to put pressure on him to pull out and let them have control of the Republican Party.
[1:02:01.000 --> 1:02:04.000]  So that's a great good thing Trump is doing is not backing down.
[1:02:04.000 --> 1:02:09.000]  So they're getting ready to probably indict Giuliani and then Don Jr.
[1:02:09.000 --> 1:02:12.000]  So I say I have a love, disgust relationship with Trump.
[1:02:12.000 --> 1:02:13.000]  I love Trump.
[1:02:13.000 --> 1:02:18.000]  He's a good guy. He means well, but on the vaccines, he stepped in it and on the censorship.
[1:02:18.000 --> 1:02:19.000]  He didn't do anything.
[1:02:19.000 --> 1:02:23.000]  They still is being nice to Rubio and other neocon Republicans.
[1:02:23.000 --> 1:02:31.000]  So we need however we can on his new website, the president's desk and all the rest of it to reach out to him with feedback and say,
[1:02:31.000 --> 1:02:35.000]  we want you to still be hardcore.
[1:02:35.000 --> 1:02:40.000]  We want you to realize you got bamboozled by these so-called shots truly going to hurt you as the evidence comes out.
[1:02:40.000 --> 1:02:42.000]  He needs to realize he was wrong now.
[1:02:42.000 --> 1:02:46.000]  We really need you to continue the purge of the neocon.
[1:02:46.000 --> 1:02:49.000]  So again, we need to keep Trump very close to us.
[1:02:49.000 --> 1:02:54.000]  He is our friend when you keep them very, very close, but with tough love.
[1:02:54.000 --> 1:02:55.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:02:57.000 --> 1:03:04.000]  The scientific dictatorship that I've been warning you about for 27 years has now gone from beta testing to operational.
[1:03:04.000 --> 1:03:10.000]  The globalists are out of the open with their planetary depopulation takeover, their robot takeover.
[1:03:10.000 --> 1:03:18.000]  But the good news is we've been working and you've been working and others have been working across the planet for decades to get ready for this to be able to find it on.
[1:03:18.000 --> 1:03:19.000]  Humanity is strong.
[1:03:19.000 --> 1:03:20.000]  We're incredible.
[1:03:20.000 --> 1:03:24.000]  And if we're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it.
[1:03:24.000 --> 1:03:26.000]  If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[1:03:26.000 --> 1:03:28.000]  So prayer is essential.
[1:03:28.000 --> 1:03:29.000]  Research is essential.
[1:03:29.000 --> 1:03:33.000]  Getting prepared is essential and warning others is absolutely essential.
[1:03:33.000 --> 1:03:40.000]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family.
[1:03:40.000 --> 1:03:42.000]  And they're also funding our operation.
[1:03:42.000 --> 1:03:44.000]  InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:03:44.000 --> 1:03:47.000]  InfoWarsStore.com is incredible.
[1:03:47.000 --> 1:03:53.000]  A lot of our products that have been sold out because supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies, vasovetes and others.
[1:03:53.000 --> 1:03:55.000]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:03:55.000 --> 1:04:05.000]  And I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[1:04:26.000 --> 1:04:28.000]  I'm Alex Schoen, your host.
[1:04:28.000 --> 1:04:32.000]  You will ask me, why do you live in the New San Francisco, the new LA?
[1:04:32.000 --> 1:04:36.000]  Well, it's because my ancestors have been here since the 1820s.
[1:04:36.000 --> 1:04:43.000]  And my ancestors are buried here and they're buried in Central Texas and East Texas and North Texas.
[1:04:43.000 --> 1:04:48.000]  And my family's connected to Travis and the whole nine yards.
[1:04:48.000 --> 1:04:52.000]  So it's really hard to abandon the state.
[1:04:52.000 --> 1:04:56.000]  And it is very close to turning deep, evil, blue via election fraud.
[1:04:56.000 --> 1:05:00.000]  And so that's why I still stay in my beloved state.
[1:05:00.000 --> 1:05:09.000]  Though I do look enviously at Florida and it's ongoing awakening.
[1:05:09.000 --> 1:05:12.000]  And that's because they got good leadership there like the Santas.
[1:05:12.000 --> 1:05:20.000]  But if you just joined us, I dropped the mega super giant bombshell that you've already all heard about in a lot of other very respected
[1:05:20.000 --> 1:05:25.000]  and also prestigious medical reports and studies going back two decades,
[1:05:25.000 --> 1:05:30.000]  but really intensifying the last decade that they tried to create coronavirus vaccines.
[1:05:30.000 --> 1:05:32.000]  Because coronaviruses kill pigs.
[1:05:32.000 --> 1:05:33.000]  They kill cows.
[1:05:33.000 --> 1:05:34.000]  They kill sheep.
[1:05:34.000 --> 1:05:36.000]  They kill chickens.
[1:05:36.000 --> 1:05:37.000]  They kill geese.
[1:05:37.000 --> 1:05:38.000]  They kill ducks.
[1:05:38.000 --> 1:05:41.000]  They kill turkey.
[1:05:41.000 --> 1:05:45.000]  And so they've been trying to figure this out for a long time to save money.
[1:05:45.000 --> 1:05:51.000]  Because you get a virus in one of these big coupes, you know, kill a couple hundred thousand year chickens, you lose your ass.
[1:05:51.000 --> 1:05:56.000]  Well, they've been searching for decades and when they give them to these animals,
[1:05:56.000 --> 1:06:05.000]  they end up dying of autoimmune diseases, their bodies, eat holes in their brains, their hearts, their lungs, and their arteries.
[1:06:05.000 --> 1:06:07.000]  Overhead shot please.
[1:06:07.000 --> 1:06:09.000]  Well, this just got brought to my attention.
[1:06:09.000 --> 1:06:11.000]  I went and checked it on the University of Texas website.
[1:06:11.000 --> 1:06:19.000]  This is the University of Texas biological research center level four, one of the most prestigious in the world.
[1:06:19.000 --> 1:06:27.000]  Immunization with SARS coronavirus vaccines leads to pulmonary autoimmune response.
[1:06:27.000 --> 1:06:29.000]  Immunopathologies, what's that means?
[1:06:29.000 --> 1:06:33.000]  And it says this had autoimmune responses in the mice.
[1:06:33.000 --> 1:06:36.000]  We test on mice is very similar to us with the way they react.
[1:06:36.000 --> 1:06:42.000]  And then they have showed the photos and all of it and they have the control group, the non control group, the control group.
[1:06:42.000 --> 1:06:46.000]  You know, those that were challenged got really sick.
[1:06:46.000 --> 1:06:48.000]  Those that weren't giving it didn't get sick.
[1:06:48.000 --> 1:06:55.000]  They did a bunch of studies and it's got all the photos of the holes, even their lungs, their brains and their hearts.
[1:06:55.000 --> 1:06:57.000]  And they say you should not try these vaccines.
[1:06:57.000 --> 1:07:01.000]  They did three different vaccines, three different types and they all failed.
[1:07:01.000 --> 1:07:03.000]  They all killed the animals.
[1:07:03.000 --> 1:07:15.000]  So that's the University of Texas, Department of Microbiology and immunology, the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America,
[1:07:15.000 --> 1:07:26.000]  Center for Biodefense, what's weapons lab, and Emerging Disease, the University of Texas Medical Branch, Galveston, Texas, United States of America, Department of Medicine,
[1:07:26.000 --> 1:07:37.000]  Baylor College of Medicine worked on it, Houston, Texas, United States of America, Department of Molecular Biology, Baylor College, U.T. and Baylor at the Bioweapon Lab.
[1:07:37.000 --> 1:07:41.000]  Level four, Bioweapon Lab, highest level.
[1:07:41.000 --> 1:07:49.000]  So what do you think about and what's your take and what's your experience been as a medical worker, as a doctor, as a nurse?
[1:07:49.000 --> 1:07:52.000]  Let's go ahead and talk to Francesco.
[1:07:52.000 --> 1:07:56.000]  I really appreciate holding from Pennsylvania. Go ahead and tell us your view on this.
[1:07:56.000 --> 1:07:57.000]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[1:07:57.000 --> 1:08:00.000]  First of all, I've been trying to tell you this for two years.
[1:08:00.000 --> 1:08:02.000]  I was blessed enough to get through today.
[1:08:02.000 --> 1:08:07.000]  I have never heard you speak so much about the Lord Jesus Christ as I have in the last few years.
[1:08:07.000 --> 1:08:11.000]  And I have to say it's got to be because your wife is a blessing to you.
[1:08:11.000 --> 1:08:21.000]  So I just wanted to say that I've been wanting to tell you that for a couple of years now that I've been in long term care for about 30 years, mostly geriatric nursing.
[1:08:21.000 --> 1:08:23.000]  I've never seen anything like this.
[1:08:23.000 --> 1:08:25.000]  It scares me to death.
[1:08:25.000 --> 1:08:32.000]  My residents got the Pfizer shot, the first one in January, and then they got the second one in February.
[1:08:32.000 --> 1:08:38.000]  And all of them started with people who are normally coherent, alert and oriented.
[1:08:38.000 --> 1:08:39.000]  You would talk to them.
[1:08:39.000 --> 1:08:42.000]  It was like they didn't even, they weren't even in the room with you.
[1:08:42.000 --> 1:08:43.000]  They weren't coherent.
[1:08:43.000 --> 1:08:45.000]  It was like your words were going right through them.
[1:08:45.000 --> 1:08:50.000]  One of my residents in particular was fine one day, got the second shot.
[1:08:50.000 --> 1:08:52.000]  I was off for a couple of days.
[1:08:52.000 --> 1:08:53.000]  I came back.
[1:08:53.000 --> 1:08:54.000]  They said he was dead.
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:09:00.000]  My co-workers who have gotten the Pfizer shot are complaining of tingling in their hands, tingling in their feet.
[1:09:00.000 --> 1:09:02.000]  They're missing a lot of work.
[1:09:02.000 --> 1:09:04.000]  They're calling out left and right.
[1:09:04.000 --> 1:09:11.000]  One of the nurses I work with on a regular basis says she can't even work in her garden anymore because her hands are numb.
[1:09:11.000 --> 1:09:14.000]  So, I mean, this is, this is horrific.
[1:09:14.000 --> 1:09:16.000]  And of course they tell you what that is.
[1:09:16.000 --> 1:09:18.000]  That's Guillaume Moret.
[1:09:18.000 --> 1:09:21.000]  No, no, no, not in this case.
[1:09:21.000 --> 1:09:22.000]  She's not the only one.
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:25.000]  There are other nurses that are also complaining of this.
[1:09:25.000 --> 1:09:26.000]  Well, listen, you're the nurse.
[1:09:26.000 --> 1:09:27.000]  You know more than I do.
[1:09:27.000 --> 1:09:32.000]  I'm just saying they admit these shots have been causing Guillaume Moret, which is people getting numb, but please continue.
[1:09:32.000 --> 1:09:33.000]  Yeah.
[1:09:33.000 --> 1:09:39.000]  And they're, these people are, I mean, having trouble walking some of these nurses and they're young people.
[1:09:39.000 --> 1:09:40.000]  They're young.
[1:09:40.000 --> 1:09:42.000]  They're in their 30s, early 40s.
[1:09:42.000 --> 1:09:43.000]  Some of them are in their 20s.
[1:09:43.000 --> 1:09:51.000]  And, you know, there are so many of my colleagues and coworkers that I've talked to before the vaccine was given out.
[1:09:51.000 --> 1:09:53.000]  You know, they swore up and down.
[1:09:53.000 --> 1:09:54.000]  They weren't going to get it.
[1:09:54.000 --> 1:09:55.000]  Oh, no, I'm not going to get it.
[1:09:55.000 --> 1:09:56.000]  It's experimental.
[1:09:56.000 --> 1:09:58.000]  I wouldn't, I'm not going to put that poison in my body.
[1:09:58.000 --> 1:09:59.000]  They all got it.
[1:09:59.000 --> 1:10:00.000]  Why?
[1:10:00.000 --> 1:10:02.000]  I don't understand.
[1:10:02.000 --> 1:10:04.000]  Well, I would warn those that have already gotten it.
[1:10:04.000 --> 1:10:06.000]  The more they take, the more they're going to get sick.
[1:10:06.000 --> 1:10:07.000]  The studies are there.
[1:10:07.000 --> 1:10:09.000]  China won't take the mRNA vaccine.
[1:10:09.000 --> 1:10:10.000]  Either will India.
[1:10:10.000 --> 1:10:11.000]  They banned it.
[1:10:11.000 --> 1:10:15.000]  So when they act like you're a weirdo for not wanting to do it, they're wrong.
[1:10:15.000 --> 1:10:16.000]  What have you done?
[1:10:16.000 --> 1:10:18.000]  Have you refused or are you currently working?
[1:10:18.000 --> 1:10:23.000]  Oh, I'm working, but I'm waiting for the day when they tell me I have to take it or I lose my job.
[1:10:23.000 --> 1:10:24.000]  They'll take me off the schedule.
[1:10:24.000 --> 1:10:25.000]  I'm sure it's coming.
[1:10:25.000 --> 1:10:31.000]  Well, you know, it violates the Nuremberg code to make you take an experimental vaccine.
[1:10:31.000 --> 1:10:33.000]  God bless you, ma'am, and thank you for your testimony.
[1:10:33.000 --> 1:10:36.000]  Although that wasn't showing nothing is.
[1:10:36.000 --> 1:10:40.000]  And that's what I hear from people that work in nursing homes, people that work in hospitals.
[1:10:40.000 --> 1:10:41.000]  The same thing.
[1:10:41.000 --> 1:10:43.000]  And you see it in the news and you got it in the studies.
[1:10:43.000 --> 1:10:45.000]  It's not anecdotal, folks.
[1:10:45.000 --> 1:10:49.000]  That's why they made it emergency authorization so it didn't go through human trials because
[1:10:49.000 --> 1:10:52.000]  the trials would scientifically show what happened.
[1:10:52.000 --> 1:10:55.000]  But they lie on TV and tell you, oh, it's been tested.
[1:10:55.000 --> 1:10:56.000]  It's totally safe.
[1:10:56.000 --> 1:10:58.000]  No one's ever gotten hurt.
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:10:59.000]  I'm John Oliver.
[1:10:59.000 --> 1:11:00.000]  Don't listen to Alan Jones.
[1:11:00.000 --> 1:11:01.000]  Wow.
[1:11:01.000 --> 1:11:04.000]  Just showed you the University of Texas.
[1:11:04.000 --> 1:11:07.000]  They always have a different vaccine.
[1:11:07.000 --> 1:11:08.000]  Really?
[1:11:08.000 --> 1:11:12.000]  People are getting blood clots and heart attacks with all of the two different types.
[1:11:12.000 --> 1:11:14.000]  mRNA and virus vector.
[1:11:14.000 --> 1:11:17.000]  China and others are doing whole virus, which is radiated.
[1:11:17.000 --> 1:11:23.000]  Shown in Australia, they had to pull it because people were getting HIV false positive tests
[1:11:23.000 --> 1:11:28.000]  because it's a cold virus with HIV delivery system welded onto it.
[1:11:28.000 --> 1:11:32.000]  We told you 14 months ago because that's what all the scientists at Scanditz said.
[1:11:32.000 --> 1:11:35.000]  All right, let's talk to Travis in Wisconsin.
[1:11:35.000 --> 1:11:37.000]  Travis, thanks for holding her on the air.
[1:11:37.000 --> 1:11:38.000]  You're a medical worker.
[1:11:38.000 --> 1:11:40.000]  Tell us what's going on.
[1:11:40.000 --> 1:11:42.000]  Hey, Alex.
[1:11:42.000 --> 1:11:45.000]  Long time listener, first time caller.
[1:11:45.000 --> 1:11:48.000]  I'm kind of nervous, but sorry about that.
[1:11:48.000 --> 1:11:54.000]  I've been working in the caregiving business since I was 18 years old and I haven't seen
[1:11:54.000 --> 1:11:56.000]  anything like this, man.
[1:11:56.000 --> 1:11:58.000]  It's insane.
[1:11:58.000 --> 1:12:06.000]  During the first wave of COVID, we had, I think, probably five or six months where nobody
[1:12:06.000 --> 1:12:10.000]  was infected and then we had probably, I think, four or five cases.
[1:12:10.000 --> 1:12:14.000]  And I had one gentleman who was 100 years old, no symptoms whatsoever.
[1:12:14.000 --> 1:12:17.000]  We had to quarantine everybody in the whole place.
[1:12:17.000 --> 1:12:18.000]  He recovered.
[1:12:18.000 --> 1:12:20.000]  He's still living.
[1:12:20.000 --> 1:12:28.000]  I had another lady in her mid 80s, no symptoms, totally recovered, fine.
[1:12:28.000 --> 1:12:30.000]  Everybody recovered just fine.
[1:12:30.000 --> 1:12:35.000]  And then we have this Satan shot, I guess you'd say.
[1:12:35.000 --> 1:12:45.000]  And I had one man passed out on his, for God's sakes.
[1:12:45.000 --> 1:12:49.000]  And he was gone for a couple of months and came back.
[1:12:49.000 --> 1:12:52.000]  I just, I don't understand what's going on with this thing.
[1:12:52.000 --> 1:12:59.000]  Waking up to it, everybody that's in my facility, you know, they say something's not right here.
[1:12:59.000 --> 1:13:02.000]  I got one family that I take care of, their parents.
[1:13:02.000 --> 1:13:06.000]  He runs a funeral home locally here.
[1:13:06.000 --> 1:13:13.000]  And I just so happened to talk to him yesterday and him and his wife were like, yes, something's
[1:13:13.000 --> 1:13:14.000]  not right here.
[1:13:14.000 --> 1:13:15.000]  Something's not adding up.
[1:13:15.000 --> 1:13:18.000]  And, you know, I just wanted to make my guess.
[1:13:18.000 --> 1:13:22.000]  I'm now seeing more dead bodies than they were supposedly under COVID with the old people dying,
[1:13:22.000 --> 1:13:23.000]  because that's what we're seeing.
[1:13:23.000 --> 1:13:26.000]  And now they're saying, oh, people are dying of COVID, but most people in the hospital
[1:13:26.000 --> 1:13:29.000]  actually are there from the COVID vaccine.
[1:13:29.000 --> 1:13:30.000]  Right.
[1:13:30.000 --> 1:13:31.000]  Yeah.
[1:13:31.000 --> 1:13:37.000]  Everybody that I talked to, I mean, I shouldn't say everybody, but, you know, I'd say probably
[1:13:37.000 --> 1:13:43.000]  at least 70% are waking up to the fact that it just, the math doesn't add up.
[1:13:43.000 --> 1:13:45.000]  Well, protect those old people.
[1:13:45.000 --> 1:13:46.000]  Protect those old people.
[1:13:46.000 --> 1:13:49.000]  They're going to order you to keep shooting them up till they die.
[1:13:49.000 --> 1:13:51.000]  It's a giant test of Milgram experiment.
[1:13:51.000 --> 1:13:57.000]  We'll be right back.
[1:13:57.000 --> 1:14:02.000]  One of the most popular memes on the Internet in the last decade has been, Alex Jones was
[1:14:02.000 --> 1:14:08.000]  right, but it now routinely trends number one on platforms like Twitter and Facebook,
[1:14:08.000 --> 1:14:11.000]  making the globalists pull their hair out in anger.
[1:14:11.000 --> 1:14:13.000]  But let me tell you, we are tomorrow's news today.
[1:14:13.000 --> 1:14:14.000]  And thanks for your support.
[1:14:14.000 --> 1:14:19.000]  We're still on air at infowars.com and band.video radio stations and TV stations across the country.
[1:14:19.000 --> 1:14:24.000]  And our film Endgame, censored and taken offline by Amazon when it hit number one a few years
[1:14:24.000 --> 1:14:27.000]  ago, is now available again.
[1:14:27.000 --> 1:14:29.000]  We have reprinted it on high quality DVD in HD.
[1:14:29.000 --> 1:14:30.000]  It has a zero country code.
[1:14:30.000 --> 1:14:33.000]  Anyone in the world is authorized to make copies of it.
[1:14:33.000 --> 1:14:35.000]  And I'm asking you to get the original, make copies.
[1:14:35.000 --> 1:14:36.000]  Give it to everyone you know.
[1:14:36.000 --> 1:14:37.000]  Get it on local access TV.
[1:14:37.000 --> 1:14:41.000]  Give it to your pastors, your police chiefs, your state reps, your prime ministers, whatever
[1:14:41.000 --> 1:14:42.000]  you do, warn the world.
[1:14:42.000 --> 1:14:47.000]  This film uses their own documents and own statements 14 years ago to expose them.
[1:14:47.000 --> 1:14:48.000]  It's more important than ever.
[1:14:48.000 --> 1:14:50.000]  Available at infowarsstore.com.
[1:14:50.000 --> 1:14:51.000]  That's infowarsstore.com.
[1:14:51.000 --> 1:14:56.000]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[1:15:21.000 --> 1:15:27.000]  Our innocent children, we are brothers and sisters together and it has just been an incredible
[1:15:27.000 --> 1:15:29.000]  experience to work with you over the years.
[1:15:29.000 --> 1:15:32.000]  And as crazy your things are, I want to keep working under the future.
[1:15:32.000 --> 1:15:36.000]  But again, that's really up to you and up to God.
[1:15:36.000 --> 1:15:41.000]  So please, I hope God works through you and puts a message in your heart to support us.
[1:15:41.000 --> 1:15:43.000]  But again, that's up to you and your relationship with God.
[1:15:43.000 --> 1:15:47.000]  I just want to thank you all for the years of support you've given us and what you've
[1:15:47.000 --> 1:15:52.000]  done and just ask you again to pray to God and ask what God's vision is for you.
[1:15:52.000 --> 1:15:55.000]  And hopefully God will touch your heart to continue to support infowars.
[1:15:55.000 --> 1:15:59.000]  God bless.
[1:15:59.000 --> 1:16:15.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:16:15.000 --> 1:16:20.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, this just broke out of the official communist Chinese daily.
[1:16:20.000 --> 1:16:24.000]  The communist Chinese government is telling its population, you don't have to take the
[1:16:24.000 --> 1:16:25.000]  vaccines.
[1:16:25.000 --> 1:16:28.000]  Less than 5% of the Japanese have taken it.
[1:16:28.000 --> 1:16:32.000]  They know what's going on and they've banned the US vaccines in China.
[1:16:32.000 --> 1:16:38.000]  So as India, because they know, I guess China runs the US now, this is a bio weapon attack
[1:16:38.000 --> 1:16:43.000]  to stun us, poison us and give us so many sick people, we will fully collapse from this.
[1:16:43.000 --> 1:16:47.000]  If we don't, hell, they've already shot up probably 40% of the public.
[1:16:47.000 --> 1:16:49.000]  And then we've got such Stockholm syndrome.
[1:16:49.000 --> 1:16:52.000]  I mean, this is just insane.
[1:16:52.000 --> 1:16:57.000]  University of Texas officially put out a report eight years ago, nine years ago saying you
[1:16:57.000 --> 1:17:03.000]  can't take any COVID vaccines, any coronavirus vaccines because it causes your body to attack
[1:17:03.000 --> 1:17:04.000]  itself.
[1:17:04.000 --> 1:17:06.000]  Let's talk to a medical doctor, they say.
[1:17:06.000 --> 1:17:08.000]  She goes by Jeff.
[1:17:08.000 --> 1:17:13.000]  She says family is all medical workers on vaccines.
[1:17:13.000 --> 1:17:16.000]  So thanks for joining us from South Carolina.
[1:17:16.000 --> 1:17:17.000]  Hi, Alex.
[1:17:17.000 --> 1:17:21.000]  I don't know if you remember, but we spoke, I think like two months ago now in one of
[1:17:21.000 --> 1:17:24.000]  your shows for about 20, 25 minutes.
[1:17:24.000 --> 1:17:30.000]  There was a segment where I was speaking about COVID vaccines and previous type of COVID
[1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:32.000]  vaccines, the veterinary community.
[1:17:32.000 --> 1:17:35.000]  My grandmother had passed away after the COVID vaccine.
[1:17:35.000 --> 1:17:36.000]  That's right.
[1:17:36.000 --> 1:17:39.000]  Several segments, I really appreciate you coming on.
[1:17:39.000 --> 1:17:40.000]  Yeah.
[1:17:40.000 --> 1:17:44.000]  So I've been trying to call for the last week and this is just very diffident that I called
[1:17:44.000 --> 1:17:45.000]  and got on right away.
[1:17:45.000 --> 1:17:51.000]  So I wanted to give Dallin the whole audience an update since my grandmother passed away,
[1:17:51.000 --> 1:17:57.000]  my great-uncle passed away in the same exact scenario within two weeks of receiving the
[1:17:57.000 --> 1:18:00.000]  Pfizer first, actually the first COVID vaccine.
[1:18:00.000 --> 1:18:04.000]  He was actually more clinically healthy, but the same situation came down with COVID-like
[1:18:04.000 --> 1:18:06.000]  symptoms and died and he was COVID negative.
[1:18:06.000 --> 1:18:11.000]  And yet that side of my family still cannot understand that maybe the COVID vaccine was
[1:18:11.000 --> 1:18:12.000]  part of it.
[1:18:12.000 --> 1:18:17.000]  I know plenty of people since then who have had pretty significant reactions from crazy
[1:18:17.000 --> 1:18:22.000]  appendicitis leading to aseptic abdomen to tinnitus, which I just heard last night.
[1:18:22.000 --> 1:18:24.000]  I mean, Tucker Carlson was talking about it.
[1:18:24.000 --> 1:18:28.000]  Apparently tinnitus, like one-third of the whole tinnitus are ringing in your ear cases
[1:18:28.000 --> 1:18:33.000]  that have been reported so far this year have all potentially been COVID vaccine related.
[1:18:33.000 --> 1:18:36.000]  And for folks who don't know, that's usually when nerves are dying or being eaten.
[1:18:36.000 --> 1:18:39.000]  I mean, this is causing an autoimmune response all over the body.
[1:18:39.000 --> 1:18:41.000]  That's what the UT study says.
[1:18:41.000 --> 1:18:46.000]  What do you think of them knowing this study from a bio weapons research lab on par and
[1:18:46.000 --> 1:18:48.000]  above the Wuhan lab?
[1:18:48.000 --> 1:18:54.000]  This was a global advisory by the lab that protects against these things saying, don't do it.
[1:18:54.000 --> 1:18:55.000]  Oh, absolutely.
[1:18:55.000 --> 1:18:59.000]  I mean, the thing is we know about this, but right now this is all about social pressure
[1:18:59.000 --> 1:19:02.000]  and what I specifically wanted to speak about is being in South Carolina.
[1:19:02.000 --> 1:19:07.000]  I don't know if you know this or if your listeners know this, but I'm Houston Methodist in Texas.
[1:19:07.000 --> 1:19:11.000]  This is the big hospital system that's been in the news over the last month to two months
[1:19:11.000 --> 1:19:15.000]  about requiring mandatory COVID vaccines for employees.
[1:19:15.000 --> 1:19:19.000]  So the medical university of South Carolina, which is the largest hospital system in South
[1:19:19.000 --> 1:19:25.000]  Carolina has also come out requiring their hospital staff, including all contractors to
[1:19:25.000 --> 1:19:26.000]  the hospital.
[1:19:26.000 --> 1:19:30.000]  So it's not entirely clear when they say contractors, do they just mean medical staff or do they
[1:19:30.000 --> 1:19:36.000]  also mean lay people who come and service the building to be vaccinated by June of 2021.
[1:19:36.000 --> 1:19:40.000]  This came down the pipeline within the last couple of weeks.
[1:19:40.000 --> 1:19:45.000]  Originally they put out an email saying it was just for their management staff and their
[1:19:45.000 --> 1:19:46.000]  leadership staff.
[1:19:46.000 --> 1:19:47.000]  So they always are expanding it.
[1:19:47.000 --> 1:19:48.000]  That's the plan of this.
[1:19:48.000 --> 1:19:52.000]  So bottom line here are people waking up that this is experimental.
[1:19:52.000 --> 1:19:57.000]  It violates the Nuremberg code and you can show them mainline studies saying don't do it.
[1:19:57.000 --> 1:19:58.000]  Absolutely.
[1:19:58.000 --> 1:20:01.000]  People definitely are especially because now it's in our backyard.
[1:20:01.000 --> 1:20:05.000]  I think even those who say that they've been awake this whole time, you're not really going
[1:20:05.000 --> 1:20:10.000]  to understand how this is rapidly falling apart and you're quickly going to be expected
[1:20:10.000 --> 1:20:14.000]  to do things against your will or lose your job and your way to support your family, which
[1:20:14.000 --> 1:20:20.000]  is something that my personal family is struggling with right now because of this.
[1:20:20.000 --> 1:20:26.000]  The issue is on a statewide level, those of us who have been trying to get in with local
[1:20:26.000 --> 1:20:30.000]  committee people, local elections, sending letters to local representatives, even Henry
[1:20:30.000 --> 1:20:31.000]  McMaster.
[1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:36.000]  These bills for protecting people, especially healthcare workers against being required
[1:20:36.000 --> 1:20:42.000]  to take this mandatory COVID experimental gene therapy have not been passed through
[1:20:42.000 --> 1:20:43.000]  in Congress.
[1:20:43.000 --> 1:20:45.000]  Well listen, I appreciate you calling.
[1:20:45.000 --> 1:20:46.000]  I'm glad you got on.
[1:20:46.000 --> 1:20:49.000]  If you want to come on as a guest and keep your name private, stay on.
[1:20:49.000 --> 1:20:50.000]  We'll get your number.
[1:20:50.000 --> 1:20:51.000]  If not, I understand.
[1:20:51.000 --> 1:20:52.000]  I appreciate your call.
[1:20:52.000 --> 1:20:53.000]  We're going to move to get everybody on.
[1:20:53.000 --> 1:20:56.000]  But ladies and gentlemen, this doesn't protect you from COVID-19.
[1:20:56.000 --> 1:20:58.000]  You don't go back to normal when you get it.
[1:20:58.000 --> 1:21:02.000]  And you certainly, your body is going to be riddled with problems.
[1:21:02.000 --> 1:21:04.000]  They picked something that attacks the cardiovascular system.
[1:21:04.000 --> 1:21:09.000]  It's going to kill a lot of old people right away, but it's going to kill others down the
[1:21:09.000 --> 1:21:10.000]  road.
[1:21:10.000 --> 1:21:13.000]  And then as they say, you got to get more and more and more because it, quote, doesn't
[1:21:13.000 --> 1:21:14.000]  work.
[1:21:14.000 --> 1:21:15.000]  Well, it is working.
[1:21:15.000 --> 1:21:18.000]  It gives you cardiovascular disease amongst other things.
[1:21:18.000 --> 1:21:20.000]  And it attacks your uterus.
[1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:21.000]  This is it.
[1:21:21.000 --> 1:21:25.000]  That's why the former VP of Pfizer says it's a depopulation weapon.
[1:21:25.000 --> 1:21:29.000]  Go to the live show feed of the broadcast.
[1:21:29.000 --> 1:21:30.500]  Put it back on screen, please.
[1:21:30.500 --> 1:21:36.840]  With the headline, global bombshell, University of Texas, research team or coronavirus vaccines
[1:21:36.840 --> 1:21:39.740]  cause massive heart attacks, strokes, blood clots.
[1:21:39.740 --> 1:21:40.740]  It says it.
[1:21:40.740 --> 1:21:42.000]  It says, don't take it.
[1:21:42.000 --> 1:21:44.000]  It's definitive.
[1:21:44.000 --> 1:21:48.120]  And under the live show feed, scroll down under the video of the show that you share
[1:21:48.120 --> 1:21:49.840]  is the study.
[1:21:49.840 --> 1:21:51.400]  It's on that page.
[1:21:51.400 --> 1:21:52.840]  Save some lives now.
[1:21:52.840 --> 1:21:53.840]  Fight back.
[1:21:53.840 --> 1:21:54.840]  That's why they've been censoring everybody.
[1:21:54.840 --> 1:21:58.320]  They can only get away with this covert attack if no one's warning them.
[1:21:58.320 --> 1:22:02.560]  I can say shame on Google, Facebook and Twitter, but they're all on board with this.
[1:22:02.560 --> 1:22:04.800]  I mean, think of the employees there going along with this.
[1:22:04.800 --> 1:22:05.800]  This is just madness.
[1:22:05.800 --> 1:22:06.800]  This is total depopulation.
[1:22:06.800 --> 1:22:07.800]  All right.
[1:22:07.800 --> 1:22:11.800]  This has been home the longest here.
[1:22:11.800 --> 1:22:17.960]  Let's go ahead and talk to Brian in PA as a nurse.
[1:22:17.960 --> 1:22:18.960]  Wipe as a doc.
[1:22:18.960 --> 1:22:19.960]  Tell us what you're seeing.
[1:22:19.960 --> 1:22:20.960]  Yes, sir.
[1:22:20.960 --> 1:22:21.960]  How you doing, Alex?
[1:22:21.960 --> 1:22:22.960]  I'm pretty freaked out.
[1:22:22.960 --> 1:22:23.960]  Go ahead.
[1:22:23.960 --> 1:22:24.960]  Me too.
[1:22:24.960 --> 1:22:31.520]  So I'm a healthcare worker in long-term care, so I've seen the virus.
[1:22:31.520 --> 1:22:36.240]  I've seen the vaccine come along and I've had to deal with all the guidances that we
[1:22:36.240 --> 1:22:43.240]  have to, as an employer, deal with from the CDC, finished Medicare, Medicaid and the government.
[1:22:43.240 --> 1:22:50.320]  And, well, side note, my wife, being a practitioner, dealing with other practitioners, are seeing
[1:22:50.320 --> 1:22:58.040]  people with otherwise no known positive features for a blood clot, have blood clot.
[1:22:58.040 --> 1:23:02.560]  And she's like, you know, they're talking about amongst themselves, and I said, well,
[1:23:02.560 --> 1:23:04.040]  who are you reporting it to?
[1:23:04.040 --> 1:23:05.040]  Give me a sign.
[1:23:05.040 --> 1:23:06.400]  You're kind of mumbling your phone.
[1:23:06.400 --> 1:23:07.400]  Talk right into it.
[1:23:07.400 --> 1:23:08.400]  Sorry.
[1:23:08.400 --> 1:23:11.800]  So the question is, who are you reporting it to?
[1:23:11.800 --> 1:23:13.040]  Who can you report it to?
[1:23:13.040 --> 1:23:21.440]  Well, no one, because basically, it's not going to be correlated to the vaccine.
[1:23:21.440 --> 1:23:26.040]  So if this would have been a normal vaccine study over years and years and years, we would
[1:23:26.040 --> 1:23:31.400]  have percentages and numbers and age groups of people having all these associated side
[1:23:31.400 --> 1:23:34.280]  effects, but now we're not going to.
[1:23:34.280 --> 1:23:37.280]  Now we're going to see all these people and the doctors are going to know, but they're
[1:23:37.280 --> 1:23:38.280]  never going to coordinate.
[1:23:38.280 --> 1:23:39.960]  They're going to say, well, that guy had...
[1:23:39.960 --> 1:23:40.960]  That's right.
[1:23:40.960 --> 1:23:43.400]  When the doctor complains, they're going to get censored or fired.
[1:23:43.400 --> 1:23:44.600]  They've thought this out.
[1:23:44.600 --> 1:23:46.360]  They've war-gamed it all out.
[1:23:46.360 --> 1:23:49.080]  That's why they didn't do this long-term study.
[1:23:49.080 --> 1:23:54.440]  That's why they didn't do the animal study, because UT and Wuhan and Chapel Hill and everybody
[1:23:54.440 --> 1:23:55.880]  already did it.
[1:23:55.880 --> 1:23:57.880]  And they found, wow, this kills the animals.
[1:23:57.880 --> 1:23:58.880]  They went perfect.
[1:23:58.880 --> 1:24:00.320]  Give it to the humans.
[1:24:00.320 --> 1:24:04.040]  Isn't that diabolical, brother?
[1:24:04.040 --> 1:24:05.040]  It's sad.
[1:24:05.040 --> 1:24:06.040]  It's just sad.
[1:24:06.040 --> 1:24:14.120]  Now we're dealing with reopening and guidances and how to deal with vaccinated versus unvaccinated.
[1:24:14.120 --> 1:24:17.720]  And what it's coming down to now is more division and labeling people.
[1:24:17.720 --> 1:24:18.720]  Well...
[1:24:18.720 --> 1:24:19.720]  Oh, yeah.
[1:24:19.720 --> 1:24:21.600]  Oh, the Yankees, the Mets, you aren't vaccinated.
[1:24:21.600 --> 1:24:23.360]  You give to a separate area.
[1:24:23.360 --> 1:24:24.680]  You don't get the good seats.
[1:24:24.680 --> 1:24:25.680]  It's yes.
[1:24:25.680 --> 1:24:26.680]  And everybody's...
[1:24:26.680 --> 1:24:28.760]  I mean, are the medical workers not seeing through this?
[1:24:28.760 --> 1:24:30.200]  I mean, it makes people sick.
[1:24:30.200 --> 1:24:31.200]  It kills people.
[1:24:31.200 --> 1:24:32.200]  It did the studies.
[1:24:32.200 --> 1:24:33.200]  It does it.
[1:24:33.200 --> 1:24:35.200]  And that's why they didn't do the studies, because they already did the studies.
[1:24:35.200 --> 1:24:36.200]  What?
[1:24:36.200 --> 1:24:43.040]  I think they're getting that psychologically forced into it.
[1:24:43.040 --> 1:24:46.920]  Maybe some of them are as weak as, well, I really wanted to go on my vacation to the
[1:24:46.920 --> 1:24:47.920]  Caribbean.
[1:24:47.920 --> 1:24:49.320]  And so I'll get it.
[1:24:49.320 --> 1:24:50.320]  Exactly.
[1:24:50.320 --> 1:24:51.320]  Folks, do not take it.
[1:24:51.320 --> 1:24:52.320]  It's my 11th.
[1:24:52.320 --> 1:24:53.320]  Thank you, sir.
[1:24:53.320 --> 1:24:58.440]  I don't like coming to you and saying this could be our last broadcast.
[1:24:58.440 --> 1:25:02.640]  I've been on there 27 years, and only the last year or so have I said that.
[1:25:02.640 --> 1:25:05.840]  But let me tell you, the New World Order is breathing down our neck.
[1:25:05.840 --> 1:25:08.920]  The big globalist publications are coming after us, and they're doing everything they
[1:25:08.920 --> 1:25:10.240]  can to shut us down.
[1:25:10.240 --> 1:25:14.560]  So please pray to keep Info Wars on the air, and please support the local states you're
[1:25:14.560 --> 1:25:15.560]  listening to as well.
[1:25:15.560 --> 1:25:21.680]  At the same time, go to infowarstore.com while you still can, and get a book, get a film,
[1:25:21.680 --> 1:25:26.560]  get a t-shirt, get some supplements, because it's that money that helps us stay on air
[1:25:26.560 --> 1:25:28.040]  in the face of this thing.
[1:25:28.040 --> 1:25:30.160]  I need your help more than ever now.
[1:25:30.160 --> 1:25:34.480]  I want to keep fighting the globalists, but I can't do it if you don't support us.
[1:25:34.480 --> 1:25:39.320]  So pray for us, word of mouth, tell folks about the broadcast, however you can, and
[1:25:39.320 --> 1:25:45.080]  buy great products that will enrich you and your family's lives every day at infowarstore.com.
[1:25:45.080 --> 1:25:49.760]  Whether it's high quality coffee, for supplements, or books or films, all of it nurtures the
[1:25:49.760 --> 1:25:54.680]  soul, all of it empowers humanity, all of it is pro-human and pro-God.
[1:25:54.680 --> 1:25:55.680]  Thank you so much.
[1:25:55.680 --> 1:25:59.480]  When listeners call into the show and thank me for all I've done, I always stop them and
[1:25:59.480 --> 1:26:02.480]  I say, thank you for what you've done.
[1:26:02.480 --> 1:26:04.380]  Thank you for keeping Info Wars on the air.
[1:26:04.380 --> 1:26:08.000]  Thank you for praying for us, and thank you for spreading the word.
[1:26:08.000 --> 1:26:13.800]  If all of you will simply go to infowarstore.com and get a privacy pocket for your iPhone or
[1:26:13.800 --> 1:26:18.400]  a Droid, it will teach you and others that these things are surveilling you.
[1:26:18.400 --> 1:26:22.800]  It will remind you every day, like it does me and my family, and it will protect where
[1:26:22.800 --> 1:26:24.440]  you go and what you do.
[1:26:24.440 --> 1:26:28.200]  Not because you've done something wrong, but because the big telecoms, big tech, and
[1:26:28.200 --> 1:26:31.600]  the globalists are predatory and are evil, and in the surveillance state, we need to
[1:26:31.600 --> 1:26:35.960]  more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're
[1:26:35.960 --> 1:26:36.960]  involved in.
[1:26:36.960 --> 1:26:41.200]  These are the highest quality, highest ratings, they're available at infowarstore.com in four
[1:26:41.200 --> 1:26:44.200]  different colors, and they are only $19.95.
[1:26:44.200 --> 1:26:48.400]  The exact same pocket is sold for $24.95, or even $29.95 everywhere.
[1:26:48.400 --> 1:26:51.680]  They're available right now for $19.95, and they fund the Info War.
[1:26:51.680 --> 1:26:56.200]  Please take action today, protect your privacy, and fund the Info War.
[1:26:56.200 --> 1:27:01.840]  Others have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so saying, where are most
[1:27:01.840 --> 1:27:04.560]  of the best-selling products you have that we love?
[1:27:04.560 --> 1:27:07.280]  And my answer is, the supply chain has broken down.
[1:27:07.280 --> 1:27:11.080]  I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot of these, and
[1:27:11.080 --> 1:27:13.520]  so that's why we don't have a lot of products in.
[1:27:13.520 --> 1:27:17.080]  That's why Info Wars is in financial trouble, is because if we had the product, you would
[1:27:17.080 --> 1:27:18.880]  be buying it, we'd have the money.
[1:27:18.880 --> 1:27:22.280]  But so many of them have been sold out, just like you noticed, a lot of other items at
[1:27:22.280 --> 1:27:26.400]  the store aren't available because civilization is being artificially imploded.
[1:27:26.400 --> 1:27:32.760]  But finally, X2 is back in stock with a good halogen, Deep Earth Crystal iodide, so essential
[1:27:32.760 --> 1:27:33.760]  in your body.
[1:27:33.760 --> 1:27:34.760]  It's really the missing link.
[1:27:34.760 --> 1:27:35.760]  It's 50% off.
[1:27:35.760 --> 1:27:38.760]  We've got a big shipment of it at InfoWarsTour.com.
[1:27:38.760 --> 1:27:42.560]  Now, when it gets ready to sell out, we'll have to go back to near full price, take advantage
[1:27:42.560 --> 1:27:46.960]  of this now, stock up, and don't forget to take your X2, because I have a tendency to
[1:27:46.960 --> 1:27:51.760]  forget how great it is and not take it myself, but when I do, stamina, libido, energy, weight
[1:27:51.760 --> 1:27:52.760]  loss, it's incredible.
[1:27:52.760 --> 1:27:53.760]  It's essential.
[1:27:53.760 --> 1:27:54.760]  It's X2 at InfoWarsTour.com.

[1:28:58.600 --> 1:29:12.200]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[1:29:12.200 --> 1:29:15.520]  Ladies and gentlemen, Bill Gates said he wants to depopulate the planet and the UN wants
[1:29:15.520 --> 1:29:18.200]  to do it, the globalists want to do it.
[1:29:18.200 --> 1:29:23.600]  But we know it's a specific attack on Europe, Australia, New Zealand, the US.
[1:29:23.600 --> 1:29:28.040]  That's where they're hitting people with the mRNA vaccines and the virus vector vaccines.
[1:29:28.040 --> 1:29:32.000]  And China, in fact, guys, I saw the article printed for me, bring it out, please.
[1:29:32.000 --> 1:29:36.440]  China just came out and told its provinces, do not do force inoculations and don't try
[1:29:36.440 --> 1:29:39.240]  to threaten people with social credit score to do it.
[1:29:39.240 --> 1:29:43.000]  But that's what's happening here because we're the target.
[1:29:43.000 --> 1:29:47.400]  We're meant to be gotten rid of and it's actuated and designed to really hit baby boomers that
[1:29:47.400 --> 1:29:52.080]  are retiring now or hitting retirement age to kill you.
[1:29:52.080 --> 1:29:56.480]  It's a very sophisticated bio weapon in these vaccines.
[1:29:56.480 --> 1:29:57.480]  And the facts are coming in.
[1:29:57.480 --> 1:29:59.120]  You're hearing the medical workers are seeing the studies.
[1:29:59.120 --> 1:30:03.760]  I mean, this is the reality and they wouldn't have gotten away with this without the censorship.
[1:30:03.760 --> 1:30:07.280]  That's why to life and death, you download the video today of this interview and these
[1:30:07.280 --> 1:30:11.320]  calls and you share it and you take clips of it and you put it on Twitter and Facebook
[1:30:11.320 --> 1:30:12.320]  and YouTube.
[1:30:12.320 --> 1:30:13.320]  What if you get banned?
[1:30:13.320 --> 1:30:16.000]  You're going to be killed anyways.
[1:30:16.000 --> 1:30:17.680]  Put it out on Reddit.
[1:30:17.680 --> 1:30:21.160]  Put it out on BitShoot.
[1:30:21.160 --> 1:30:25.080]  Have your neighbors over and download it and show it to them on your big screen TV.
[1:30:25.080 --> 1:30:26.320]  This is a war.
[1:30:26.320 --> 1:30:27.640]  Get out of your comfort zone.
[1:30:27.640 --> 1:30:30.800]  Let's go in the order the calls have been received.
[1:30:30.800 --> 1:30:32.320]  Really appreciate you all calling in.
[1:30:32.320 --> 1:30:35.920]  James in Iowa, tell us about your pregnant sister and what happened.
[1:30:35.920 --> 1:30:37.520]  How's it going, Alex?
[1:30:37.520 --> 1:30:38.520]  First time caller.
[1:30:38.520 --> 1:30:42.120]  I just want to start out by saying thank you for waking me up.
[1:30:42.120 --> 1:30:46.160]  I haven't really been in the politics until the whole COVID thing happened.
[1:30:46.160 --> 1:30:51.280]  I started listening to you and you just really woke me up.
[1:30:51.280 --> 1:30:59.560]  So about a month ago, my sister, she took the Pfizer vaccine and about two weeks later
[1:30:59.560 --> 1:31:06.640]  after she took it, her baby started having seizures and they're trying to link it to
[1:31:06.640 --> 1:31:07.640]  her husband.
[1:31:07.640 --> 1:31:13.640]  It runs in his family, but I just think it's kind of weird that after a week of her taking
[1:31:13.640 --> 1:31:16.320]  the vaccine, the baby started having these seizures.
[1:31:16.320 --> 1:31:18.480]  Do you know what time she took?
[1:31:18.480 --> 1:31:19.480]  Pfizer.
[1:31:19.480 --> 1:31:21.120]  Yeah, that's the mRNA vaccine.
[1:31:21.120 --> 1:31:24.120]  That's what I thought I heard you say.
[1:31:24.120 --> 1:31:29.680]  Pfizer specifically in their own public trials, in the real trials, they just gave the public,
[1:31:29.680 --> 1:31:31.880]  said we do have concern about shedding.
[1:31:31.880 --> 1:31:35.440]  We have concern about breastfeeding women and did I hear you right?
[1:31:35.440 --> 1:31:36.440]  Was she breastfeeding?
[1:31:36.440 --> 1:31:41.960]  So she pumped and dumped for like two days after she took the vaccine and I told her,
[1:31:41.960 --> 1:31:46.320]  I'm like, it's not going to do anything, it gets in your DNA, and that's the reason she
[1:31:46.320 --> 1:31:47.320]  took it.
[1:31:47.320 --> 1:31:48.960]  She's like, well, I want to protect my baby.
[1:31:48.960 --> 1:31:52.520]  I want to protect him from COVID and I'm like, you know, kids don't get it.
[1:31:52.520 --> 1:31:57.760]  Oh, seeing his headline was like, young people's and mothers should take it to protect babies.
[1:31:57.760 --> 1:32:01.440]  Yeah, you're going to, so I'm not laughing at your sister, I'm just laughing at how women
[1:32:01.440 --> 1:32:05.360]  think the system loves them and it's totally killing them.
[1:32:05.360 --> 1:32:09.640]  And so the baby was fine and then had convulsions after breast milk.
[1:32:09.640 --> 1:32:10.640]  Yeah.
[1:32:10.640 --> 1:32:14.760]  So he had, he started having seizures and they're minor seizures at first.
[1:32:14.760 --> 1:32:19.360]  So they, they took them into the hospital and they gave them some seizure medicine and
[1:32:19.360 --> 1:32:23.200]  then it took care of it for three, four days.
[1:32:23.200 --> 1:32:28.800]  And then my mom was watching them because she's off a couple of days a week and watches
[1:32:28.800 --> 1:32:31.800]  them and she was watching them and noticed that he started having seizures again and
[1:32:31.800 --> 1:32:34.680]  they were more intense and more severe.
[1:32:34.680 --> 1:32:36.200]  So he went back in again.
[1:32:36.200 --> 1:32:37.760]  So they switched the medicine.
[1:32:37.760 --> 1:32:39.280]  Well, here's the deal.
[1:32:39.280 --> 1:32:46.000]  Obviously she's still breastfeeding and formula and see if it changes anything like that.
[1:32:46.000 --> 1:32:49.760]  She needs to stop breastfeeding and I'm, it'll probably stop God, God bless you, sir.
[1:32:49.760 --> 1:32:50.880]  I got to jump everybody on.
[1:32:50.880 --> 1:32:52.800]  We could talk for 10 hours, couldn't we?
[1:32:52.800 --> 1:32:58.040]  You know, I promise take my four year old daughter fishing.
[1:32:58.040 --> 1:33:01.640]  I forgot this Saturday, so I'm not coming into a special three, four hour commercial
[1:33:01.640 --> 1:33:02.640]  free show.
[1:33:02.640 --> 1:33:03.640]  So all you guys can call in.
[1:33:03.640 --> 1:33:11.440]  If the crew tells me a time that they can come in Friday night or maybe Sunday night,
[1:33:11.440 --> 1:33:18.240]  I should, you know what, Sunday night, I should do the Sunday night live that Owen usually
[1:33:18.240 --> 1:33:19.240]  does.
[1:33:19.240 --> 1:33:21.520]  It only has six minutes and ads an hour anyways.
[1:33:21.520 --> 1:33:28.680]  And so Sunday night, four to eight PM, I will do nothing but take calls to give us, you
[1:33:28.680 --> 1:33:30.160]  love the vaccine, you hate it.
[1:33:30.160 --> 1:33:33.600]  And you hear, of course, what you're getting is one horrible story after another.
[1:33:33.600 --> 1:33:35.320]  Then I have the actual UT science.
[1:33:35.320 --> 1:33:36.320]  This isn't anecdotal.
[1:33:36.320 --> 1:33:37.320]  They say, don't take it.
[1:33:37.320 --> 1:33:41.120]  It'll cause seizures, cause blood clots, it'll cause brain damage because your body to attack
[1:33:41.120 --> 1:33:42.120]  your own self.
[1:33:42.120 --> 1:33:46.360]  And the baby drinks that in with mother's milk that it takes to totally absorb the first
[1:33:46.360 --> 1:33:48.120]  few months of mother's milk has colostrum.
[1:33:48.120 --> 1:33:52.240]  All of her immunity is given to the baby.
[1:33:52.240 --> 1:34:01.960]  The ultimate vaccine, and now it's getting mRNA to attack his own little proteins, man,
[1:34:01.960 --> 1:34:04.480]  turning the mother's milk into poison.
[1:34:04.480 --> 1:34:09.000]  And they even Pfizer says it's that, but they don't tell you do they say, no, she's
[1:34:09.000 --> 1:34:14.120]  not going to go, I want to protect my baby from COVID.
[1:34:14.120 --> 1:34:15.280]  How many women have to die?
[1:34:15.280 --> 1:34:16.280]  How many men?
[1:34:16.280 --> 1:34:17.280]  How many babies?
[1:34:17.280 --> 1:34:19.040]  Actually, folks are going to like it.
[1:34:19.040 --> 1:34:23.240]  The more die we're seeing people go, well, I'm going to, I had a miscarriage when I took
[1:34:23.240 --> 1:34:24.240]  the shot.
[1:34:24.240 --> 1:34:27.040]  I'm going to, if I'm pregnant again, I'll take one again.
[1:34:27.040 --> 1:34:28.120]  Never admitting you're wrong.
[1:34:28.120 --> 1:34:32.120]  Just doubling down, doubling down, doubling down.
[1:34:32.120 --> 1:34:37.360]  Heard that medical doctor call in her family or her mother died and then now the uncle
[1:34:37.360 --> 1:34:41.520]  died, but the family's like, we're going to keep giving the old folks these shots.
[1:34:41.520 --> 1:34:42.520]  Damn it.
[1:34:42.520 --> 1:34:48.560]  We're not going to stop ever because we're not going to admit we helped kill somebody.
[1:34:48.560 --> 1:34:49.560]  We're not going to admit we're wrong.
[1:34:49.560 --> 1:34:50.560]  We never do that.
[1:34:50.560 --> 1:34:53.720]  The media told us it's the right thing to do.
[1:34:53.720 --> 1:34:56.720]  Lee in Oklahoma is a paramedic.
[1:34:56.720 --> 1:34:57.720]  What's your view?
[1:34:57.720 --> 1:35:01.960]  What are you seeing?
[1:35:01.960 --> 1:35:04.200]  Appreciate everything that you've done for everybody, Alex.
[1:35:04.200 --> 1:35:05.200]  We appreciate you greatly.
[1:35:05.200 --> 1:35:07.360]  I mean, I'm under attack too.
[1:35:07.360 --> 1:35:08.560]  I need you to get out of this.
[1:35:08.560 --> 1:35:09.560]  You need me.
[1:35:09.560 --> 1:35:10.560]  We're all under attack.
[1:35:10.560 --> 1:35:12.880]  It'd be like we're all in a lifeboat with a hole in it.
[1:35:12.880 --> 1:35:16.400]  We're trying to plug the hole and we're bailing water and you're thanking me.
[1:35:16.400 --> 1:35:20.320]  I'm trying to put a plug and like, thank you for plugging the boat and I'm like, Lee, we're
[1:35:20.320 --> 1:35:21.640]  in this damn boat together.
[1:35:21.640 --> 1:35:22.640]  Thank you too.
[1:35:22.640 --> 1:35:23.640]  Go ahead.
[1:35:23.640 --> 1:35:28.520]  Well, long time paramedic, been a paramedic about 30 years, highly educated guy.
[1:35:28.520 --> 1:35:31.800]  I tried to express to people about what's going on.
[1:35:31.800 --> 1:35:35.520]  I explained to him, hey, I'm a long time healthcare professional.
[1:35:35.520 --> 1:35:37.280]  I've got a lot of education behind me.
[1:35:37.280 --> 1:35:42.440]  It's taught me how to research and people still look at you like you're crazy and you
[1:35:42.440 --> 1:35:46.120]  know, we transport a lot of people, a lot of elderly people.
[1:35:46.120 --> 1:35:51.160]  So one of the things that I've gone to asking patients now whenever they present, they present
[1:35:51.160 --> 1:35:57.000]  with severe weakness, severe respiratory difficulty, nausea, vomiting.
[1:35:57.000 --> 1:35:59.160]  Basically I'll ask, have you had the COVID shot?
[1:35:59.160 --> 1:36:00.960]  Yes, we've had the COVID shot.
[1:36:00.960 --> 1:36:06.760]  A lot of these patients that we're seeing are COVID shot related patients.
[1:36:06.760 --> 1:36:11.040]  You know, I mean, they present with debilitating weakness.
[1:36:11.040 --> 1:36:15.080]  You know, it's hard to pin down exactly when death happens.
[1:36:15.080 --> 1:36:18.800]  You know, it's like, you know, some, you know, a couple of weeks, some a couple of days after
[1:36:18.800 --> 1:36:23.400]  the fact, these nursing homes just push this vaccine like crazy.
[1:36:23.400 --> 1:36:28.520]  My wife and I have basically sold our property and are literally moving off the grid because
[1:36:28.520 --> 1:36:34.480]  we know that it's going to eventually come to the point that we are not, my, my employers
[1:36:34.480 --> 1:36:38.760]  are going to push me to taking this vaccine and I refuse to take it.
[1:36:38.760 --> 1:36:40.440]  We'll never take this thing.
[1:36:40.440 --> 1:36:46.400]  I've seen too much bad outcome, but our bosses get on Facebook and they present themselves
[1:36:46.400 --> 1:36:50.120]  showing themselves like we're heroes, you know, we're taking these vaccines, we're taking
[1:36:50.120 --> 1:36:51.120]  these shots.
[1:36:51.120 --> 1:36:52.120]  You guys should do the same.
[1:36:52.120 --> 1:36:53.760]  No, I won't.
[1:36:53.760 --> 1:36:55.280]  I refuse to.
[1:36:55.280 --> 1:36:59.680]  And then my wife, we've prepared that we're going to eventually, I'm probably going to
[1:36:59.680 --> 1:37:01.480]  lose my job.
[1:37:01.480 --> 1:37:04.080]  And that's pretty much where we're at with it.
[1:37:04.080 --> 1:37:05.080]  We refuse to take it.
[1:37:05.080 --> 1:37:09.000]  Well, you're not the only one, the biggest exodus out of the cities ever has happened
[1:37:09.000 --> 1:37:12.560]  and we're going to form our own communities and we're going to watch everybody all sadly
[1:37:12.560 --> 1:37:13.560]  die.
[1:37:13.560 --> 1:37:16.760]  And that's the really sad part about folks living under Stockholm syndrome, Lee, is they
[1:37:16.760 --> 1:37:18.080]  won't listen.
[1:37:18.080 --> 1:37:22.960]  Warn those families, warn those people, warn old folks you see, warn others, God bless
[1:37:22.960 --> 1:37:23.960]  you.
[1:37:23.960 --> 1:37:25.920]  Let's gather another call.
[1:37:25.920 --> 1:37:31.720]  Let's go ahead and talk to Rebecca in Minnesota.
[1:37:31.720 --> 1:37:32.720]  Go ahead, Rebecca.
[1:37:32.720 --> 1:37:33.720]  She's a nurse.
[1:37:33.720 --> 1:37:34.720]  Okay.
[1:37:34.720 --> 1:37:38.200]  I'm going to go down the line here quick.
[1:37:38.200 --> 1:37:45.480]  Three issues with Pfizer vaccination that I personally experienced.
[1:37:45.480 --> 1:37:53.040]  My friend, who is a nurse also has issues now with her breast and her mammograms have
[1:37:53.040 --> 1:37:55.640]  been positive and suspicious.
[1:37:55.640 --> 1:38:04.880]  My other nurse friend has tested positive after her first shot and my third friend, her mom
[1:38:04.880 --> 1:38:11.880]  just passed away sadly, two weeks after the second Pfizer shot from a massive heart attack
[1:38:11.880 --> 1:38:14.160]  and she has never had a cardiac history.
[1:38:14.160 --> 1:38:21.720]  Here are some other experiences from people that I'm closely in contact with.
[1:38:21.720 --> 1:38:24.360]  They have, my mom has not taken the test.
[1:38:24.360 --> 1:38:25.360]  Rebecca, don't hang up.
[1:38:25.360 --> 1:38:28.960]  I've got Nick Foyntes popping on with an update for one segment, but I'm going to come back
[1:38:28.960 --> 1:38:33.280]  to you because you're, everything you said, they admit heart attacks, they admit the
[1:38:33.280 --> 1:38:37.120]  breast and the uterus swelling up, they say, oh, don't worry, it's not cancer and they
[1:38:37.120 --> 1:38:39.200]  admit the other things you were mentioning.
[1:38:39.200 --> 1:38:42.520]  So you're dead on target and you're a nurse and people need to hear this and I can hear
[1:38:42.520 --> 1:38:43.520]  it in your voice.
[1:38:43.520 --> 1:38:44.920]  My voice is quivering too.
[1:38:44.920 --> 1:38:48.440]  This, we're being killed and it's through the system we're supposedly trusting, the
[1:38:48.440 --> 1:38:49.440]  medical system.
[1:38:49.440 --> 1:38:52.560]  And the medical people are going to be the key to turning this around because they know
[1:38:52.560 --> 1:38:53.560]  what's going on.
[1:38:53.560 --> 1:38:54.560]  We'll be right back.
[1:38:54.560 --> 1:38:57.560]  Let's go to Juan in Connecticut.
[1:38:57.560 --> 1:38:58.560]  You're on the air.
[1:38:58.560 --> 1:38:59.560]  Thanks for holding.
[1:38:59.560 --> 1:39:00.560]  Hello.
[1:39:00.560 --> 1:39:01.560]  Can you hear me?
[1:39:01.560 --> 1:39:02.560]  I sure can, sir.
[1:39:02.560 --> 1:39:07.040]  I just, I've been wanting to talk to you, bro, and it's a pleasure to be talking right
[1:39:07.040 --> 1:39:08.040]  now here, man.
[1:39:08.040 --> 1:39:09.040]  Sir, it's an honor to talk to you, brother.
[1:39:09.040 --> 1:39:14.600]  I'm from New Brink, Connecticut, and I just want to plug in, I'm a truck driver and Tuber
[1:39:14.600 --> 1:39:21.040]  Force have changed the way I drive, me and my brothers that drive, and a couple of us,
[1:39:21.040 --> 1:39:27.880]  we're all Hispanics, Cubans, Puerto Ricans, we used to be on Monster and Red Bull and
[1:39:27.880 --> 1:39:32.160]  Rolla and I have lost weight because I started drinking all that sugar and I just want to
[1:39:32.160 --> 1:39:33.160]  thank you for that, man.
[1:39:33.160 --> 1:39:37.720]  Well, brother, we put more in this than any other long-term, high-quality energy powder
[1:39:37.720 --> 1:39:38.720]  there is.
[1:39:38.720 --> 1:39:41.600]  So this, this was designed on one of the top guys in the country, he didn't want his name
[1:39:41.600 --> 1:39:44.600]  on it because obviously the political issues, but we had to pay a lot of money for this
[1:39:44.600 --> 1:39:48.400]  formulation just for the design of it, and we believe it is the best, strongest, but
[1:39:48.400 --> 1:39:52.320]  healthiest energy out there, and you're saying that it's made your life better, so that means
[1:39:52.320 --> 1:39:53.320]  a lot to me.
[1:39:53.320 --> 1:39:54.320]  Thank you to all your truck drivers.
[1:39:54.320 --> 1:39:55.320]  We love you.
[1:39:55.320 --> 1:40:03.600]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything has a better shot at

[1:40:06.760 --> 1:40:07.880]  the best out there.

[1:40:13.320 --> 1:40:16.480]  Everybody already knows what high-quality fish oil does, and it costs us even more to put
[1:40:16.480 --> 1:40:20.960]  it through a process to remove any trace mercury that's in it, so this is also clean fish oil.
[1:40:20.960 --> 1:40:25.600]  It's been sold out for months, but it's back in stock 50% off.
[1:40:25.600 --> 1:40:26.600]  Creel oil is set to sell out.
[1:40:26.600 --> 1:40:27.600]  It's amazing as well.
[1:40:27.600 --> 1:40:33.400]  It's at 25% off, but when you get them both together in a combo, it's 50% off as well.

[1:40:42.040 --> 1:40:43.040]  amazing.
[1:40:43.040 --> 1:40:44.200]  Blizzard thought I was joking.

[1:40:56.640 --> 1:41:01.800]  Last week, I had a caller to my radio slash TV transmission, and he said to me, he said,
[1:41:01.800 --> 1:41:06.040]  Alex, there's all these facts, all these numbers, vaccines being recalled, and people
[1:41:06.040 --> 1:41:08.240]  dying from it, and people getting sick.
[1:41:08.240 --> 1:41:12.240]  How do I reach out to my friends and family and explain to them and to warn them about
[1:41:12.240 --> 1:41:13.240]  the danger?
[1:41:13.240 --> 1:41:18.000]  And I said to him, something very profound, because it's so true, trust your gut, trust
[1:41:18.000 --> 1:41:20.040]  your spirit with the Bible tells us.
[1:41:20.040 --> 1:41:25.680]  And I said, ask those friends, those family, those neighbors, do you feel good about this
[1:41:25.680 --> 1:41:26.680]  vaccine?
[1:41:26.680 --> 1:41:30.520]  And his answer was, no, they don't feel good about it, so go with your gut.
[1:41:30.520 --> 1:41:35.120]  Well, let me ask you again, how does your gut feel about getting the storeable food?
[1:41:35.120 --> 1:41:37.280]  How does your gut feel about getting down in the countryside?
[1:41:37.280 --> 1:41:40.080]  How does your gut feel about getting guns and ammo to protect yourself?
[1:41:40.080 --> 1:41:42.240]  Well, I know what your gut's telling you.
[1:41:42.240 --> 1:41:45.280]  We have the best storeable food, the highest quality at the lowest prices you're going
[1:41:45.280 --> 1:41:51.600]  to find, 10% off at InfoWarsStore.com right now or for Paradox.com.
[1:41:51.600 --> 1:41:55.280]  Go with your gut and find the InfoWars, InfoWarsStore.com.
[1:41:55.280 --> 1:42:00.880]  14 months ago, I began to see on the broadcast every day, when the first world collapses,
[1:42:00.880 --> 1:42:02.680]  the third world dies.
[1:42:02.680 --> 1:42:07.440]  We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts that when you
[1:42:07.440 --> 1:42:12.600]  shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third world
[1:42:12.600 --> 1:42:14.160]  and really hurt the first world.
[1:42:14.160 --> 1:42:18.480]  Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States, and that's because
[1:42:18.480 --> 1:42:22.440]  the companies and the systems and the drivers that could barely get the job done before
[1:42:22.440 --> 1:42:24.440]  delivering gas had been shut down.
[1:42:24.440 --> 1:42:27.920]  Plus, the Keystone Pipeline's been shut down on one of the other pipelines.
[1:42:27.920 --> 1:42:31.440]  The left is now blowing up dams across the U.S.
[1:42:31.440 --> 1:42:32.560]  We're being shut down.
[1:42:32.560 --> 1:42:34.640]  Our coal power plants are off as well.
[1:42:34.640 --> 1:42:37.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave.
[1:42:37.560 --> 1:42:38.960]  The third world is imploding as well.
[1:42:38.960 --> 1:42:39.960]  The borders have been removed.
[1:42:39.960 --> 1:42:44.360]  Until you wake up, and this is a globalist chai-com takeover, Gregory said, you have no
[1:42:44.360 --> 1:42:45.360]  hope.
[1:42:45.360 --> 1:42:50.160]  They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds of the gas needed this summer.
[1:42:50.160 --> 1:42:53.640]  So they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you
[1:42:53.640 --> 1:42:59.640]  and your family.
[1:42:59.640 --> 1:43:23.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:43:23.600 --> 1:43:30.600]  If you are receiving this transmission, you are the resistance.
[1:43:30.600 --> 1:43:34.200]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[1:43:34.200 --> 1:43:38.520]  Well, I'll give Bill Gates and the UN and the globalists this.
[1:43:38.520 --> 1:43:44.280]  They've got WABOs the size of the Grand Canyon or size of the Grand Tetons, the size of the
[1:43:44.280 --> 1:43:45.280]  planet.
[1:43:45.280 --> 1:43:52.920]  UT, official bioweapons lab, level four, found that all coronavirus vaccines caused bleeding
[1:43:52.920 --> 1:43:57.800]  in the lungs, the brain, the heart, and blood clots on a massive scale.
[1:43:57.800 --> 1:44:01.960]  In some cases, the majority of lab rats died.
[1:44:01.960 --> 1:44:02.960]  And that's the headline.
[1:44:02.960 --> 1:44:09.760]  Immunization with SARS, coronavirus vaccines, leads to pulmonary immunopathology, with all
[1:44:09.760 --> 1:44:13.960]  the challenge subjects, all the lab animals.
[1:44:13.960 --> 1:44:17.280]  That is from 2012, and there's a bunch of other reports coming out.
[1:44:17.280 --> 1:44:18.280]  They knew this.
[1:44:18.280 --> 1:44:19.280]  They did it.
[1:44:19.280 --> 1:44:23.600]  And that way, they can plausibly deny when your loved one has a heart attack or a stroke
[1:44:23.600 --> 1:44:26.880]  or a blood clot, and you see what's coming out with all the vaccines.
[1:44:26.880 --> 1:44:30.160]  Please don't forget we're listener-supported, parabolic force, 10 hours clean energy, back
[1:44:30.160 --> 1:44:31.600]  of stock, 40% off.
[1:44:31.600 --> 1:44:35.680]  Also, we have the great ultimate fish oil, highest grade fish oil, great for your heart,
[1:44:35.680 --> 1:44:37.520]  your brain, your whole body.
[1:44:37.520 --> 1:44:43.840]  It is 50% off, and X2, the good halogen, 50% off, and of course, vitamin D3 is your immune
[1:44:43.840 --> 1:44:48.120]  system, winter sun, back of stock, 50% off as well, and that funds the operation.
[1:44:48.120 --> 1:44:52.880]  All right, I was going to get him on for an hour today, and I appreciate him joining us,
[1:44:52.880 --> 1:44:56.640]  but I've got to have Greg Reese and others, and special reports that cut coming this morning
[1:44:56.640 --> 1:44:59.960]  because I got called away with a family court thing I got to deal with.
[1:44:59.960 --> 1:45:03.480]  You know, I'm always under siege here, that's fine, but that's coming up, and I'll be back
[1:45:03.480 --> 1:45:04.480]  this afternoon.
[1:45:04.480 --> 1:45:07.760]  But he's just there to give us an update and some breaking news.
[1:45:07.760 --> 1:45:10.520]  Nick Fuentes put on a no-fly list.
[1:45:10.520 --> 1:45:12.000]  They won't even tell him why.
[1:45:12.000 --> 1:45:16.600]  They now admit he's on a no-fly list, and so he has retained a prominent civil rights
[1:45:16.600 --> 1:45:17.760]  lawyer, Norm Pattison.
[1:45:17.760 --> 1:45:21.720]  Today, I have a big announcement to make, so thanks for coming on, Nick.
[1:45:21.720 --> 1:45:24.400]  Thank you so much for having me, I appreciate it.
[1:45:24.400 --> 1:45:26.440]  Make the big announcement for us, please.
[1:45:26.440 --> 1:45:27.520]  Absolutely, yes.
[1:45:27.520 --> 1:45:32.360]  So I was on your show last week to talk about my placement on the no-fly list, which we
[1:45:32.360 --> 1:45:37.720]  suspect was for political reasons, and you brought on the great lawyer, Norm Pattison.
[1:45:37.720 --> 1:45:41.440]  We got a chance to talk a little bit, and I actually gave him a call after his show,
[1:45:41.440 --> 1:45:46.680]  and I've now retained him to represent me in a case against the TSA, and we should be
[1:45:46.680 --> 1:45:48.800]  filing, I believe, next week.
[1:45:48.800 --> 1:45:54.280]  So we're going to take it to the courts against the TSA and the federal government.
[1:45:54.280 --> 1:45:58.760]  Give us updates on what's happened to you, because now we have this new Pentagon report
[1:45:58.760 --> 1:46:04.600]  I covered in the first hour from DARPA saying anyone that thinks the government's corrupt
[1:46:04.600 --> 1:46:10.560]  or is too big or overstepped its bounds will be targeted by the Pentagon, by the CIA, and
[1:46:10.560 --> 1:46:13.880]  by a Black Lives Matter leader who is now in command of them.
[1:46:13.880 --> 1:46:17.920]  I mean, I read this DARPA report, and just it was even worse than I thought it could
[1:46:17.920 --> 1:46:18.920]  be.
[1:46:18.920 --> 1:46:22.920]  Absolutely, and it gets worse, it seems, with each passing day.
[1:46:22.920 --> 1:46:26.880]  And it's interesting, because I used to talk about this on my show a lot.
[1:46:26.880 --> 1:46:30.720]  I know that a lot of my viewers used to say things like during the 2020 election, they
[1:46:30.720 --> 1:46:35.360]  would say, well, maybe it's not such a bad thing if Biden gets elected, because things
[1:46:35.360 --> 1:46:38.440]  are going to have to get worse before they get better, before people are going to wake
[1:46:38.440 --> 1:46:40.320]  up and see what's going on.
[1:46:40.320 --> 1:46:44.880]  And I used to say on my show that what's going to happen first and foremost right out of
[1:46:44.880 --> 1:46:49.880]  the gate is that life is going to get a lot harder, a lot faster for people like you and
[1:46:49.880 --> 1:46:53.960]  I, actually, for people like you, Alex, and people like me, for the real dissidents, for
[1:46:53.960 --> 1:46:58.280]  the real people that are challenging the American regime and the American system, it's going
[1:46:58.280 --> 1:47:01.320]  to get much worse very quickly for us before anybody else.
[1:47:01.320 --> 1:47:04.400]  And this is exactly what you're seeing at a breakneck pace.
[1:47:04.400 --> 1:47:10.000]  The Biden administration is using the full weight of the federal government now to persecute
[1:47:10.000 --> 1:47:14.920]  anybody that opposes a dissent against their regime, against their administration.
[1:47:14.920 --> 1:47:18.000]  And for a long time, it was big tech censorship.
[1:47:18.000 --> 1:47:22.160]  It was sort of this corporate tyranny that was working against conservatives, working
[1:47:22.160 --> 1:47:26.200]  against patriots, right-wing people, even under the Trump administration.
[1:47:26.200 --> 1:47:30.080]  But now people are seeing what that looks like when it's not just the corporate tyrants,
[1:47:30.080 --> 1:47:35.360]  but it's also with the full assent and the full sort of complicity of the federal government
[1:47:35.360 --> 1:47:36.360]  behind it as well.
[1:47:36.360 --> 1:47:41.320]  And I just saw a report last week, which I covered on my show, which said that now the
[1:47:41.320 --> 1:47:46.920]  DHS, Department of Homeland Security, is going and they're using private contractors, using
[1:47:46.920 --> 1:47:52.840]  private companies to spy on patriots, on people that are dissenting against the regime.
[1:47:52.840 --> 1:47:56.600]  And then if they give the designation, you are now a domestic terrorist.
[1:47:56.600 --> 1:48:02.440]  I mean, I read this and it read like a cartoon of what bad guys would be in like a novel or
[1:48:02.440 --> 1:48:03.440]  something.
[1:48:03.440 --> 1:48:07.000]  They literally say if they don't trust the government and believe it's too big, they
[1:48:07.000 --> 1:48:11.120]  are terrorists and we need to take them out.
[1:48:11.120 --> 1:48:15.760]  And anyone that thinks that the nation-state should be here is a white supremacist.
[1:48:15.760 --> 1:48:18.240]  I mean, it reads like a cartoon book.
[1:48:18.240 --> 1:48:19.240]  Literally.
[1:48:19.240 --> 1:48:20.480]  Yeah, it literally does.
[1:48:20.480 --> 1:48:24.640]  It reads like, you know, the most alarmist predictions of what the left would become,
[1:48:24.640 --> 1:48:30.160]  where the government would go from 10, 20, 30 years ago, and it's transpiring right now
[1:48:30.160 --> 1:48:31.160]  before.
[1:48:31.160 --> 1:48:33.960]  And then it goes, whites don't get any farm aid.
[1:48:33.960 --> 1:48:35.200]  Whites don't get any student aid.
[1:48:35.200 --> 1:48:40.280]  I mean, they're actually just announcing whites are bad all over TV.
[1:48:40.280 --> 1:48:41.280]  It's true.
[1:48:41.280 --> 1:48:42.280]  It's true.
[1:48:42.280 --> 1:48:43.280]  And we've been saying this for years.
[1:48:43.280 --> 1:48:44.440]  Whites are now being targeted.
[1:48:44.440 --> 1:48:49.000]  I think it's basically the creation of like this racial caste system in America because
[1:48:49.000 --> 1:48:53.240]  clearly there's these double standards where there's one set of rules that applies to one
[1:48:53.240 --> 1:48:56.680]  group of people and one set of rules that applies to everybody else.
[1:48:56.680 --> 1:49:01.560]  When you look at like the BLM protests last year, this is maybe the best example.
[1:49:01.560 --> 1:49:07.720]  And these people are tearing up Portland, Seattle, Chicago, D.C., Minneapolis, famously.
[1:49:07.720 --> 1:49:09.280]  And it's BLM and it's Antifa.
[1:49:09.280 --> 1:49:10.280]  And that's just fine.
[1:49:10.280 --> 1:49:15.160]  You know, they go out in the middle of Seattle and they call it the Capitol Hill or the Capitol
[1:49:15.160 --> 1:49:16.520]  Autonomous Zone.
[1:49:16.520 --> 1:49:20.360]  And they literally declare, I mean, what else do you call that other than an insurrection
[1:49:20.360 --> 1:49:23.200]  when they say, we're declaring we have our own autonomy?
[1:49:23.200 --> 1:49:26.880]  And the fire department, when they declared the Autonomous Zone, said that they wouldn't
[1:49:26.880 --> 1:49:29.680]  even shut off their water, their electricity.
[1:49:29.680 --> 1:49:32.360]  They said they wouldn't even move in and disrupt the barricades.
[1:49:32.360 --> 1:49:36.880]  They were allowed to declare their own autonomous country in the middle of a major city.
[1:49:36.880 --> 1:49:37.880]  And that was last year.
[1:49:37.880 --> 1:49:39.960]  That was Antifa BLM.
[1:49:39.960 --> 1:49:44.120]  This year, you've got a protest at the Capitol, which the most that you could say is it was
[1:49:44.120 --> 1:49:46.520]  a protest that got a little bit out of hand.
[1:49:46.520 --> 1:49:49.560]  There was trespassing and there was disorderly conduct.
[1:49:49.560 --> 1:49:51.080]  These are misdemeanors.
[1:49:51.080 --> 1:49:52.080]  Hardly represents.
[1:49:52.080 --> 1:49:57.920]  All of the insurrection and they show photos of you and I at the Georgia Capitol with state
[1:49:57.920 --> 1:50:01.520]  rep Jones and go, look at them directing the attack in the Capitol.
[1:50:01.520 --> 1:50:02.520]  I want them in prison.
[1:50:02.520 --> 1:50:03.680]  I want them dead.
[1:50:03.680 --> 1:50:07.480]  People go, hey, that's from November 18th and they just ignore it.
[1:50:07.480 --> 1:50:10.640]  And then mainstream media runs with it and says, there they are in the Capitol.
[1:50:10.640 --> 1:50:15.440]  It's just, they've decided to just do whatever is evil, like whatever the maximum default
[1:50:15.440 --> 1:50:17.480]  evil is, they're doing it.
[1:50:17.480 --> 1:50:18.480]  Where is this?
[1:50:18.480 --> 1:50:19.480]  And it seems like it's working.
[1:50:19.480 --> 1:50:24.560]  It just bows down and says, I'm sorry, you're right, I'm evil.
[1:50:24.560 --> 1:50:25.560]  It is.
[1:50:25.560 --> 1:50:26.560]  It is working.
[1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:30.080]  And that's the scary thing is that most of the population is just going along with this.
[1:50:30.080 --> 1:50:33.480]  It's disturbing because, you know, there used to be a time when people had some kind
[1:50:33.480 --> 1:50:38.560]  of a grasp on this concept that the government is going to accuse its opponents and people
[1:50:38.560 --> 1:50:43.080]  that dissent against it of being terrorists, of being violent, of being a threat.
[1:50:43.080 --> 1:50:48.040]  And there was a time when people understood liberals and conservatives that that was always
[1:50:48.040 --> 1:50:50.920]  going to be the pretext to criminalize dissent.
[1:50:50.920 --> 1:50:54.880]  That all the government has to do is say, well, anybody that criticizes us, anybody
[1:50:54.880 --> 1:50:57.360]  that's against us is a threat to society.
[1:50:57.360 --> 1:50:58.480]  They're a terrorist.
[1:50:58.480 --> 1:51:03.480]  And that justifies, that's the pretext for ever expanding government control, ever expanding
[1:51:03.480 --> 1:51:04.480]  tyranny.
[1:51:04.480 --> 1:51:08.080]  There was a time when people understood that now people are just readily going along with
[1:51:08.080 --> 1:51:09.080]  it.
[1:51:09.080 --> 1:51:10.240]  And I see it on Twitter all the time.
[1:51:10.240 --> 1:51:16.080]  When I got put on the no fly list for like no good reason for obvious political motivations,
[1:51:16.080 --> 1:51:22.000]  I have leftist liberals, even some conservatives that don't like me in my reply saying, well,
[1:51:22.000 --> 1:51:23.840]  you know, maybe maybe you broke the rules.
[1:51:23.840 --> 1:51:27.200]  You ever thought you maybe you should have worn a mask on the plane or hey, maybe you
[1:51:27.200 --> 1:51:29.840]  should have declared an insurrection or something like that.
[1:51:29.840 --> 1:51:32.120]  They are weaponizing the no fly list.
[1:51:32.120 --> 1:51:33.120]  That's right.
[1:51:33.120 --> 1:51:34.120]  Let's be clear.
[1:51:34.120 --> 1:51:35.120]  No judge, no jury.
[1:51:35.120 --> 1:51:36.640]  They won't even tell you why you're on it.
[1:51:36.640 --> 1:51:38.760]  They're like, well, he deserves it.
[1:51:38.760 --> 1:51:41.480]  Thinking of they grovel the system, they'll be all right.
[1:51:41.480 --> 1:51:46.520]  This is anti-American, anti-freedom, toady behavior, but you got a good lawyer.
[1:51:46.520 --> 1:51:47.520]  You're going to fall suit.
[1:51:47.520 --> 1:51:51.520]  There's a process here and people should support you, you know, buy some of those great America
[1:51:51.520 --> 1:51:52.520]  first hats.
[1:51:52.520 --> 1:51:53.520]  You have, I love them.
[1:51:53.520 --> 1:51:54.520]  I'm America first.
[1:51:54.520 --> 1:51:59.680]  We're all America first here and support you because your fight is our fight.
[1:51:59.680 --> 1:52:01.800]  Yeah, absolutely.
[1:52:01.800 --> 1:52:03.040]  And thanks so much for saying that.
[1:52:03.040 --> 1:52:04.960]  Yeah, we're on America first out live.
[1:52:04.960 --> 1:52:07.960]  We have our hats at nicholasjave.com.
[1:52:07.960 --> 1:52:10.920]  And it is so important because, you know, we're going up against the whole system.
[1:52:10.920 --> 1:52:14.320]  As you know, and I'm sure that you're in a similar situation.
[1:52:14.320 --> 1:52:18.840]  We've got the entire beast, the entire system bearing down on us.
[1:52:18.840 --> 1:52:19.840]  It's the corporate tyrants.
[1:52:19.840 --> 1:52:21.340]  It's the federal government.
[1:52:21.340 --> 1:52:24.840]  And you know, somebody like me, I'm an independent operation, much like yourself.
[1:52:24.840 --> 1:52:28.040]  And so when it comes to that, we all have to stick together and that's why we're so
[1:52:28.040 --> 1:52:29.040]  appreciative.
[1:52:29.040 --> 1:52:30.040]  Absolutely.
[1:52:30.040 --> 1:52:31.040]  Let me have this closing.
[1:52:31.040 --> 1:52:32.040]  You're going to be on next week for a full hour with us.
[1:52:32.040 --> 1:52:34.920]  If you can't fly it out here, maybe we'll send a bus to get you.
[1:52:34.920 --> 1:52:39.640]  But seriously, now they're coming out and saying, use the Pentagon in the same groups
[1:52:39.640 --> 1:52:41.360]  against vaccine dissenters.
[1:52:41.360 --> 1:52:42.680]  The exact same playbook.
[1:52:42.680 --> 1:52:47.080]  They're criminalizing dissent on even medical issues now.
[1:52:47.080 --> 1:52:48.520]  You've been saying it for decades.
[1:52:48.520 --> 1:52:52.200]  You've been warning about this stuff for decades to war on our biological integrity.
[1:52:52.200 --> 1:52:53.200]  And that's exactly right.
[1:52:53.200 --> 1:52:56.160]  They're going to show up to your house and they're going to stick you with the needle.
[1:52:56.160 --> 1:52:58.280]  I'm sure a gunpoint within this decade.
[1:52:58.280 --> 1:53:03.000]  That's, that's where all this is coming next year when they release the new virus that
[1:53:03.000 --> 1:53:04.000]  Gates promises is coming.
[1:53:04.000 --> 1:53:05.000]  All right.
[1:53:05.000 --> 1:53:08.360]  Nick Fuentes, we're going to talk to you again very, very soon as soon as the suit gets
[1:53:08.360 --> 1:53:09.360]  filed.
[1:53:09.360 --> 1:53:10.360]  We really appreciate you.
[1:53:10.360 --> 1:53:11.360]  Stay in contact.
[1:53:11.360 --> 1:53:12.360]  All right.
[1:53:12.360 --> 1:53:13.360]  Thank you so much.
[1:53:13.360 --> 1:53:14.360]  I'll talk to you soon.
[1:53:14.360 --> 1:53:15.360]  Okay.
[1:53:15.360 --> 1:53:16.360]  Thank you.
[1:53:16.360 --> 1:53:17.360]  All right.
[1:53:17.360 --> 1:53:18.360]  There he goes.
[1:53:18.360 --> 1:53:19.360]  Yeah.
[1:53:19.360 --> 1:53:20.360]  We're all in this together.
[1:53:20.360 --> 1:53:21.360]  So promote his show.
[1:53:21.360 --> 1:53:22.360]  Promote my show.
[1:53:22.360 --> 1:53:23.360]  Start your own show.
[1:53:23.360 --> 1:53:24.360]  Whatever you do.
[1:53:24.360 --> 1:53:25.360]  Speak out.
[1:53:25.360 --> 1:53:26.360]  Get involved.
[1:53:26.360 --> 1:53:27.360]  Every little bit counts.
[1:53:27.360 --> 1:53:28.360]  Every order at infowarthorne.com.
[1:53:28.360 --> 1:53:29.360]  It's a bunch of bumper stickers.
[1:53:29.360 --> 1:53:30.360]  In fact, I just told them today order even more.
[1:53:30.360 --> 1:53:32.360]  We're going to put even more free bumper stickers in every order just to get them out there.
[1:53:32.360 --> 1:53:33.360]  Third dimension fight back.
[1:53:33.360 --> 1:53:34.360]  All right.
[1:53:34.360 --> 1:53:35.360]  More your calls.
[1:53:35.360 --> 1:53:36.360]  I'm going to get a few more in here.
[1:53:36.360 --> 1:53:41.660]  Finish it with Rebecca and a few others and then fight special report on pedophilia hidden
[1:53:41.660 --> 1:53:43.360]  in plain view.
[1:53:43.360 --> 1:53:49.360]  Again, I don't like to lecture people I'm a very private person, but because of the globalist
[1:53:49.360 --> 1:53:50.360]  they're attacking humanity.
[1:53:50.360 --> 1:53:55.000]  I've been forced the last 27 years to be a public figure and we've given the globalist
[1:53:55.000 --> 1:53:58.080]  one hell of a run for their money because of God.
[1:53:58.080 --> 1:54:01.560]  And I know some of our listeners get mad when I talk about God all day, but just give me
[1:54:01.560 --> 1:54:02.560]  a break.
[1:54:02.560 --> 1:54:03.560]  The Satanism's out in the open.
[1:54:03.560 --> 1:54:07.360]  It's always been a Christian, but now the fact that it's a fight between good and evil
[1:54:07.360 --> 1:54:08.360]  is so clear.
[1:54:08.360 --> 1:54:09.360]  And I get it.
[1:54:09.360 --> 1:54:10.360]  A lot of you have been turned off by big churches.
[1:54:10.360 --> 1:54:15.560]  A lot of you have been turned off by the corrupt priest class system and I get it.
[1:54:15.560 --> 1:54:16.560]  Me too.
[1:54:16.560 --> 1:54:17.560]  Believe me, I'm one of them.
[1:54:17.560 --> 1:54:23.560]  But it's that relationship with God and just God's universe that God created that is so
[1:54:23.560 --> 1:54:24.560]  essential.
[1:54:24.560 --> 1:54:28.560]  And God created the universe for us to have communion with God through and to have life.
[1:54:28.560 --> 1:54:30.560]  And so that's what infowarthorne is really all about.
[1:54:30.560 --> 1:54:32.560]  So thank you all for your word of mouth.
[1:54:32.560 --> 1:54:34.560]  Thank you for spreading the word about infowarthorne.
[1:54:34.560 --> 1:54:38.560]  And thank you for supporting us to keep us on air by visiting infowarthorne.com.
[1:54:38.560 --> 1:54:42.560]  Because without your daily and weekly monthly purchases, we'll be taking off the air.
[1:54:42.560 --> 1:54:44.560]  So thank you for the support infowarthorne.com.
[1:54:44.560 --> 1:54:49.560]  Gerald in South Carolina, go ahead, you're on the air trying to move quicker.
[1:54:49.560 --> 1:54:50.560]  Hey, Alex.
[1:54:50.560 --> 1:54:51.560]  Welcome.
[1:54:51.560 --> 1:54:55.560]  Would like to say first off, thanks for being the voice of reason and amongst all this stupidity.
[1:54:55.560 --> 1:54:58.560]  Wanted to warn people I've been trying to get ahold of you for a year.
[1:54:58.560 --> 1:54:59.560]  Okay.
[1:54:59.560 --> 1:55:05.560]  My name is Michael Lamputee and I have bacteria infection on my lung that will never go away.
[1:55:05.560 --> 1:55:07.560]  Living defense saved my life.
[1:55:07.560 --> 1:55:11.560]  They had me on antibiotics for two years that almost killed me.
[1:55:11.560 --> 1:55:13.560]  Living defense brought me back.
[1:55:13.560 --> 1:55:18.560]  I wanted to just quote from the Bible, Jesus is saying as to where we are right now.
[1:55:18.560 --> 1:55:21.560]  This is Matthew 24, verse nine.
[1:55:21.560 --> 1:55:26.560]  Then they shall deliver you up to be afflicted and shall kill you.
[1:55:26.560 --> 1:55:30.560]  We shall be hated of all nations for my name's sake.
[1:55:30.560 --> 1:55:35.560]  And then shall many be offended and shall betray one another and shall hate one another.
[1:55:35.560 --> 1:55:37.560]  That's right where we're at, brother.
[1:55:37.560 --> 1:55:41.560]  And that's because God's name is on the founding of this country no matter what they say.
[1:55:41.560 --> 1:55:58.560]  And that's why the enemy hates it because God created this country.
[1:55:58.560 --> 1:56:01.560]  Alright folks, I only got a few minutes.
[1:56:01.560 --> 1:56:02.560]  I want to take your calls all day.
[1:56:02.560 --> 1:56:04.560]  This Sunday, four to eight p.m.
[1:56:04.560 --> 1:56:08.560]  I'm going to host four hours and then two hours of it.
[1:56:08.560 --> 1:56:12.560]  I only have six minutes to add to an hour so I have a lot of time to get your calls.
[1:56:12.560 --> 1:56:15.560]  We're going to take your calls whether you love the vaccine, hate it, your stories.
[1:56:15.560 --> 1:56:18.560]  But everybody don't get to here where you get your number if you want.
[1:56:18.560 --> 1:56:19.560]  I promise I'm going to call you tomorrow.
[1:56:19.560 --> 1:56:20.560]  I'm going to do it.
[1:56:20.560 --> 1:56:21.560]  I'm going to get them back on.
[1:56:21.560 --> 1:56:23.560]  I'm going to try to finish up here.
[1:56:23.560 --> 1:56:24.560]  Rebecca, you're a nurse.
[1:56:24.560 --> 1:56:29.560]  You were really listing all the terrible things you've seen happen after people take these vaccines.
[1:56:29.560 --> 1:56:32.560]  What else would you like to add?
[1:56:32.560 --> 1:56:37.560]  This is also affecting people that have not been vaccinated as well.
[1:56:37.560 --> 1:56:42.560]  My mother, who hasn't had any cardiac issues for four years,
[1:56:42.560 --> 1:56:49.560]  has recently had two episodes of atrial fibrillation, which needed cardioversion.
[1:56:49.560 --> 1:56:54.560]  Her boyfriend is vaccinated and of course she spends a lot of time with him.
[1:56:54.560 --> 1:57:02.560]  I also have a niece that has a roommate that was just got her second shot.
[1:57:02.560 --> 1:57:08.560]  Ever since that, my niece is now having heavy period every other week.
[1:57:08.560 --> 1:57:10.560]  She's on the first control pill.
[1:57:10.560 --> 1:57:15.560]  By the way, when the shots all started six months ago in England, it was heart attacks and the same thing.
[1:57:15.560 --> 1:57:23.560]  Then we found out the literature, they knew that the call board is full of people with friends and family and having heart attacks after the shot.
[1:57:23.560 --> 1:57:24.560]  This is insane.
[1:57:24.560 --> 1:57:31.560]  Did it shock you to hear the UT report about heart attacks that they knew this 12 years ago or nine years ago?
[1:57:31.560 --> 1:57:34.560]  Yeah, well, I'm not surprised by anything.
[1:57:34.560 --> 1:57:40.560]  Then I did also want to add last night I had a friend who is a vet from the Gulf War.
[1:57:40.560 --> 1:57:46.560]  He drives patients back and forth, volunteers for vaccinations.
[1:57:46.560 --> 1:57:56.560]  He recently has had two episodes of weird skin reactions where he's had rashes all over his body, having to go to the emergency department twice.
[1:57:56.560 --> 1:58:01.560]  That's what they say is it takes over your cells and puts out these RNA streams.
[1:58:01.560 --> 1:58:06.560]  That's even what NPR scientists were on and said, we think this will create super viruses.
[1:58:06.560 --> 1:58:07.560]  God bless you, man.
[1:58:07.560 --> 1:58:08.560]  It's the ultimate weapon.
[1:58:08.560 --> 1:58:10.560]  They turn us into weapon machines.
[1:58:10.560 --> 1:58:13.560]  Like he said, soon terrorists will release weapons.
[1:58:13.560 --> 1:58:20.560]  Gates thinks humanity is a terrorist, so he's saying he made us the terrorists to terrorize ourselves, having humans kill humans.
[1:58:20.560 --> 1:58:23.560]  It's the perfect globalist operation.
[1:58:23.560 --> 1:58:24.560]  Let's talk to Mike.
[1:58:24.560 --> 1:58:26.560]  Hi, Alex.
[1:58:26.560 --> 1:58:29.560]  I think this is a bit more diabolical, actually.
[1:58:29.560 --> 1:58:34.560]  You've listed the veil for me after all these years of listening where it was entertainment initially.
[1:58:34.560 --> 1:58:38.560]  Now it's just we should have listened to you a long time ago, man.
[1:58:38.560 --> 1:58:48.560]  But I think possibly from just talking to people is this vaccine is being used as almost a way to identify.
[1:58:48.560 --> 1:58:55.560]  You separate people by those who will take it, those who won't, and of those who will take it, those who survive it.
[1:58:55.560 --> 1:59:03.560]  And then those who survive it can end up spreading the spike protein to those who don't take it.
[1:59:03.560 --> 1:59:14.560]  Your comments about removing yourself from society as it's evolving to be is probably the only answer.
[1:59:14.560 --> 1:59:19.560]  I don't think there is any other answer.
[1:59:19.560 --> 1:59:21.560]  My spirit's never been wrong.
[1:59:21.560 --> 1:59:24.560]  For six months, I've been get your family alone.
[1:59:24.560 --> 1:59:27.560]  And I'm not a agoraphobic person.
[1:59:27.560 --> 1:59:33.560]  I don't like being alone, but my gut is get your children, get out of there.
[1:59:33.560 --> 1:59:37.560]  I mean, we're just going to take our vitamins, our minerals and pray to God and transcend this.
[1:59:37.560 --> 1:59:40.560]  But yeah, this is the beginning of the end, brother.
[1:59:40.560 --> 1:59:41.560]  Can't you see it?
[1:59:41.560 --> 1:59:42.560]  They've made their move.
[1:59:42.560 --> 1:59:44.560]  Yeah, they have.
[1:59:44.560 --> 1:59:46.560]  You were right all along.
[1:59:46.560 --> 1:59:58.560]  And when I'm asked what to do, I'd say, stay healthy, find the supplements of fire you trust, and, you know, just stay healthy, be prepared.
[1:59:58.560 --> 2:00:01.560]  And I wouldn't be mean to those that are vaccinated, but they say they're going to shun us.
[2:00:01.560 --> 2:00:03.560]  Hey, please stay away from us.
[2:00:03.560 --> 2:00:04.560]  You know what? Please.
[2:00:04.560 --> 2:00:06.560]  And it's another divide and conquer, but it's what it is now.
[2:00:06.560 --> 2:00:08.560]  Thank you so much. God bless you.
[2:00:08.560 --> 2:00:11.560]  Look, Athena, Nicole and Brian, I know both of you have been holding an hour.
[2:00:11.560 --> 2:00:14.560]  I went to the callers, the order and Brian.
[2:00:14.560 --> 2:00:15.560]  I've got to go.
[2:00:15.560 --> 2:00:18.560]  I got to go deal with court stuff that just popped up yesterday.
[2:00:18.560 --> 2:00:22.560]  And so I promise you, John, don't forget the call screener.
[2:00:22.560 --> 2:00:28.560]  I'm going to have Athena, Nicole and Brian all on as my guest at 1130 tomorrow, 30 minutes into the show.
[2:00:28.560 --> 2:00:31.560]  I will go to you unless a nuclear bomb goes off or something.
[2:00:31.560 --> 2:00:32.560]  We're going to continue to open the phones up.
[2:00:32.560 --> 2:00:33.560]  All right.
[2:00:33.560 --> 2:00:36.560]  I shot two special reports this morning when I found that I had to go early.
[2:00:36.560 --> 2:00:37.560]  Those are going to air.
[2:00:37.560 --> 2:00:38.560]  They're very important.
[2:00:38.560 --> 2:00:44.560]  Gregory comes in live on air and then he's going to show some of his clips and talk about some things.
[2:00:44.560 --> 2:00:46.560]  Infowars.com to Mars news today.
[2:00:46.560 --> 2:00:48.560]  Thank you all for your support and prayers.
[2:00:48.560 --> 2:00:53.560]  Remember, God is still in charge, even though Bill Gates is playing God.
[2:00:53.560 --> 2:00:58.560]  Listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so saying,
[2:00:58.560 --> 2:01:02.560]  where are most of the best selling products you have that we love?
[2:01:02.560 --> 2:01:05.560]  And my answer is the supply chain has broken down.
[2:01:05.560 --> 2:01:08.560]  I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot of these.
[2:01:08.560 --> 2:01:11.560]  And so that's why we don't have a lot of products in.
[2:01:11.560 --> 2:01:15.560]  That's why Infowars is in financial trouble is because if we had the product, you would be buying it.
[2:01:15.560 --> 2:01:18.560]  We have the money, but so many of them have been sold out.
[2:01:18.560 --> 2:01:24.560]  Just like you noticed, a lot of other items at the store aren't available because civilization is being artificially imploded.
[2:01:24.560 --> 2:01:27.560]  But finally, X2 is back in stock.
[2:01:27.560 --> 2:01:31.560]  The good halogen, deep earth crystal iodide, so essential in your body.
[2:01:31.560 --> 2:01:32.560]  It's really the missing link.
[2:01:32.560 --> 2:01:34.560]  It's 50% off.
[2:01:34.560 --> 2:01:36.560]  We've got a big shipment of it at infowarsstore.com.
[2:01:36.560 --> 2:01:39.560]  Now, when it gets ready to sell out, we'll have to go back to near full price,
[2:01:39.560 --> 2:01:42.560]  take advantage of this now, stock up, and don't forget to take your X2.
[2:01:42.560 --> 2:01:46.560]  Because I have a tendency to forget how great it is and not take it myself.
[2:01:46.560 --> 2:01:50.560]  But when I do, stamina, libido, energy, weight loss, it's incredible.
[2:01:50.560 --> 2:02:14.560]  It's essential. It's X2 at infowarsstore.com.
[2:02:14.560 --> 2:02:18.560]  In this special report, I'm going to break something down that is hiding in plain view.
[2:02:18.560 --> 2:02:24.560]  Something that is a scientific, political, biological fact.
[2:02:24.560 --> 2:02:34.560]  And that is that the Tavistock Institute was tasked in the 50s and 60s, along with other major globalist think tanks of psychology,
[2:02:34.560 --> 2:02:39.560]  to develop a plan to end war.
[2:02:39.560 --> 2:02:45.560]  And to end war, they came back with the answer, as other major scientific think tanks had,
[2:02:45.560 --> 2:02:48.560]  they need to end the normal biological action of humans,
[2:02:48.560 --> 2:02:52.560]  because just like two bulls will fight in the field over cows for dominance,
[2:02:52.560 --> 2:02:55.560]  or two male eagles will fight over the female.
[2:02:55.560 --> 2:02:58.560]  Males are the reason we have war, they said.
[2:02:58.560 --> 2:03:03.560]  And so we need to end the male gender as it's known to stop war.
[2:03:03.560 --> 2:03:06.560]  Well, this is not the first time this has been pushed.
[2:03:06.560 --> 2:03:11.560]  The Arabs and the Ottoman Empire,
[2:03:11.560 --> 2:03:15.560]  but going back thousands of years before the Ottoman Empire, before they were even Muslims,
[2:03:15.560 --> 2:03:19.560]  the Arabic peoples, and many other groups as well,
[2:03:19.560 --> 2:03:23.560]  would kidnap European and also African slaves,
[2:03:23.560 --> 2:03:26.560]  make them slaves, and they would cut their genitals off.
[2:03:26.560 --> 2:03:32.560]  They were called eunuchs, just to type in eunuchs in the Ottoman Empire, eunuchs in the ancient world,
[2:03:32.560 --> 2:03:39.560]  and that's how they controlled them, is they would get these big strong German Europeans, big strong Africans,
[2:03:39.560 --> 2:03:45.560]  and they had found you couldn't use them to take care of your business unless you cut their genitals off.
[2:03:45.560 --> 2:03:50.560]  And so they became trusted advisors and supporters as well,
[2:03:50.560 --> 2:03:53.560]  and they took on a homosexual lifestyle,
[2:03:53.560 --> 2:03:57.560]  because they would be executed if they were found to be having sex with a female.
[2:03:57.560 --> 2:04:01.560]  So there's nothing new under the sun, there's just modern ways of doing it.
[2:04:01.560 --> 2:04:07.560]  So I'm going to break down here very quickly in the next eight minutes of this segment exactly what's happening.
[2:04:07.560 --> 2:04:13.560]  But first let's start here. This is just the last few days of persecution that ties into this.
[2:04:13.560 --> 2:04:22.560]  Street preacher, 71 arrested for distressing public with homophobic rants at Speaker's Corner in London,
[2:04:22.560 --> 2:04:27.560]  where for hundreds of years people have total free speech.
[2:04:27.560 --> 2:04:35.560]  Here is another one. Out of Canada, father jailed for calling his transgender child who was born female,
[2:04:35.560 --> 2:04:41.560]  his daughter, and denouncing her medical treatment. He is now in jail.
[2:04:41.560 --> 2:04:48.560]  Finnish politician faces six years in prison for citing Bible criticizing homosexuality.
[2:04:48.560 --> 2:04:51.560]  That's up on Implewars.com.
[2:04:51.560 --> 2:05:00.560]  Dad who referenced trans child's biological sex also had his child taken and is now being sterilized in Dallas, Texas.
[2:05:00.560 --> 2:05:03.560]  There are so many examples of these, they make your head spin.
[2:05:03.560 --> 2:05:09.560]  Now let's move on. You're like, wait a minute, eunuchs and trans children. It's the same thing.
[2:05:09.560 --> 2:05:16.560]  The Carnegie Endowment, the Rockefeller Endowment, the other big pink tanks like Tabistock that I mentioned,
[2:05:16.560 --> 2:05:20.560]  they've been obsessed with the human biological system forever.
[2:05:20.560 --> 2:05:26.560]  In fact, predating the Tabistock Institute, oldest Huxley's brother, Julian Huxley at the UN,
[2:05:26.560 --> 2:05:35.560]  the head eugenicist in the world at the time, the founder of transhumanism, said we need to basically end normal biological sex
[2:05:35.560 --> 2:05:41.560]  and create people in test tubes and have a suboid class that serves us of diminutive goblin-like creatures
[2:05:41.560 --> 2:05:46.560]  that these are quotes from him and then us, the beautiful elites that are all perfectly bred.
[2:05:46.560 --> 2:05:53.560]  So it's eugenics. It goes back to Plato in ancient Greece and of course that was 2,300 years ago.
[2:05:53.560 --> 2:05:57.560]  And so now how do you sterilize children? How do you convince them not to procreate?
[2:05:57.560 --> 2:06:02.560]  You tell them it's their decision and you make it a huge new human right.
[2:06:02.560 --> 2:06:08.560]  And then you have psychologists in the public and private schools telling particularly at-risk children,
[2:06:08.560 --> 2:06:13.560]  autistic, down syndrome and other disorders, that you get attention when you're a girl
[2:06:13.560 --> 2:06:18.560]  and you bring in girls' toys and dolls and bows and girls give them attention
[2:06:18.560 --> 2:06:23.560]  and they decide I want to be a girl because the boys are mean. Boys are competitive.
[2:06:23.560 --> 2:06:28.560]  Boys play sports. Boys fight. And it's easier just to say you're a girl
[2:06:28.560 --> 2:06:32.560]  and little boys are used to the maternal instinct even if they don't have a mother.
[2:06:32.560 --> 2:06:36.560]  And so they bond to the psychologist, the psychiatrist that poses that.
[2:06:36.560 --> 2:06:40.560]  I'm going to show you the moment where they didn't deliver the children once they believe they're a girl.
[2:06:40.560 --> 2:06:45.560]  They're usually about age seven, two large pedophile rings that rape them.
[2:06:45.560 --> 2:06:49.560]  I'm going to show you mainstream news here in a moment.
[2:06:49.560 --> 2:06:57.560]  In the war on traditional gender roles, very important article that you need to read.
[2:06:57.560 --> 2:07:02.560]  Let's continue. Berlin authorities place children with pedophiles for 30 years,
[2:07:02.560 --> 2:07:07.560]  DW.com, the biggest TV station in Germany, highly respected.
[2:07:07.560 --> 2:07:11.560]  The equivalent of like PBS. Do you see that?
[2:07:11.560 --> 2:07:16.560]  Decades they placed small children as young as three, mainly boys, with convicted pedophiles
[2:07:16.560 --> 2:07:19.560]  and said we're creating a new family, the nuclear family is bad,
[2:07:19.560 --> 2:07:23.560]  and we're going to place them with pedophiles all over Germany.
[2:07:23.560 --> 2:07:27.560]  Tens of thousands alone in Berlin alone and they would have large sex parties
[2:07:27.560 --> 2:07:33.560]  where the nuns would also take young boys, particularly the men group that are abused,
[2:07:33.560 --> 2:07:36.560]  because you know, they're boys, they're tough, they can take it,
[2:07:36.560 --> 2:07:39.560]  and would rent them out for the weekend to giant sex parties
[2:07:39.560 --> 2:07:44.560]  where children, again, as young as three, would be gang raped by up to 100 men.
[2:07:44.560 --> 2:07:47.560]  Read it for yourself. This is your liberal love.
[2:07:47.560 --> 2:07:54.560]  Continuing. Police in Germany investigate 30,000 potential suspects in pedophile probe run by the government.
[2:07:54.560 --> 2:07:58.560]  Child sex abuse trial, the horrors of Germany's activities.
[2:07:58.560 --> 2:08:00.560]  Go look it up for yourself. This is just one case.
[2:08:00.560 --> 2:08:04.560]  Now, let's move on to the modern units.
[2:08:04.560 --> 2:08:09.560]  Autistic children push to become transgender. National review.
[2:08:09.560 --> 2:08:11.560]  Even the London Guardian a decade ago reported on this.
[2:08:11.560 --> 2:08:16.560]  I had a liberal member of parliament on who talked about how more than half the autistic children
[2:08:16.560 --> 2:08:22.560]  in his jurisdiction, the people he represented in several towns and cities,
[2:08:22.560 --> 2:08:27.560]  were already on chemical surveillance or physically having genitals removed by age 10.
[2:08:27.560 --> 2:08:32.560]  Now it's age seven. They're putting them on chemicals as young as age three.
[2:08:32.560 --> 2:08:36.560]  I'm going to show you that in a moment. So this has been going on for years.
[2:08:36.560 --> 2:08:40.560]  The transgender movement targets autistic children.
[2:08:40.560 --> 2:08:43.560]  Very important article you should read.
[2:08:43.560 --> 2:08:51.560]  Pedophilia rape. Autistic girl thousands of times from when she was just three years old.
[2:08:51.560 --> 2:08:53.560]  That's there in the UK.
[2:08:53.560 --> 2:08:59.560]  Largest study to date confirms overlap between autism and gender diversity.
[2:08:59.560 --> 2:09:03.560]  Oh, yes, gender diversity, dysphoria and gender fluidity.
[2:09:03.560 --> 2:09:05.560]  Go read the actual studies.
[2:09:05.560 --> 2:09:10.560]  Trans people are up to six times more likely to have autism and related conditions.
[2:09:10.560 --> 2:09:11.560]  Landmark study confirms.
[2:09:11.560 --> 2:09:17.560]  So vaccines that are contaminated, autoimmune responses and pesticides cause brain damage.
[2:09:17.560 --> 2:09:22.560]  About 10 times more often in boys because the blood brain barrier is thinner on males.
[2:09:22.560 --> 2:09:26.560]  And when the brain damage happens, then they come next and then sterilize you,
[2:09:26.560 --> 2:09:29.560]  which is something that Planned Parenthood has pushed for a long time.
[2:09:29.560 --> 2:09:32.560]  So is the EU sterilizing the mentally handicapped.
[2:09:32.560 --> 2:09:36.560]  They make you handicapped, then they sterilize you and they make it a huge,
[2:09:36.560 --> 2:09:39.560]  wonderful, beautiful cause to live out of Hollywood.
[2:09:39.560 --> 2:09:43.560]  So if you criticize it, you're a hateful person of children that have their identity.
[2:09:43.560 --> 2:09:47.560]  They're not of age to make these decisions, even at 15, much less three.
[2:09:47.560 --> 2:09:54.560]  And psychological warfare is used on them to trick them and make their identity this way to mutilate their bodies.
[2:09:54.560 --> 2:09:56.560]  Remember all the famous eugenicists?
[2:09:56.560 --> 2:10:01.560]  Oregon was the last state to stop sterilizing women that flunked out of high school.
[2:10:01.560 --> 2:10:05.560]  That was the prerequisite or quote, low IQ.
[2:10:05.560 --> 2:10:09.560]  They were still sterilizing women in the early 80s in Oregon.
[2:10:09.560 --> 2:10:12.560]  The government health department was taking women and sterilizing them.
[2:10:12.560 --> 2:10:14.560]  This is the authoritarianism.
[2:10:14.560 --> 2:10:19.560]  Same eugenics injected, 10,000 of blacks was syphilis for 45 years and covered it up.
[2:10:19.560 --> 2:10:22.560]  Oh, but let's just trust all these people now.
[2:10:22.560 --> 2:10:27.560]  Elevated rates of autism, other neurodevelopmental and psychiatric diagnosis and autistic traits
[2:10:27.560 --> 2:10:31.560]  in transgender and adult diverse individuals.
[2:10:31.560 --> 2:10:36.560]  Nature.com, Journal of Nature, six times more likely.
[2:10:36.560 --> 2:10:40.560]  Now, when we come back, I'm going to hit the ultra massive news.
[2:10:40.560 --> 2:10:46.560]  I'm going to give you one example of one clinic, one ministry, again in Canada,
[2:10:46.560 --> 2:10:52.560]  the UK and Canada are the motherships of this, where one man has control of 500 plus children
[2:10:52.560 --> 2:10:56.560]  and they are now having three-year-olds transition.
[2:10:56.560 --> 2:10:59.560]  This is how you hide abuse in plain view.
[2:10:59.560 --> 2:11:00.560]  It is not marriage.
[2:11:00.560 --> 2:11:02.560]  We'll cover it all on the other side.
[2:11:02.560 --> 2:11:07.560]  And Greg Reese is going to be hosting with some huge news on what makes this whole satanic operation tick.
[2:11:07.560 --> 2:11:08.560]  Stay with us.
[2:11:08.560 --> 2:11:14.560]  I'm Alex Jones, infowars.com, newswars.com, band.video, tomorrow's news today.
[2:11:14.560 --> 2:11:16.560]  Everybody you know, tune in right now.
[2:11:27.560 --> 2:11:30.560]  And it's time for humanity to stand up in the info war and say,
[2:11:30.560 --> 2:11:32.560]  I don't know what's going to happen at the end of this,
[2:11:32.560 --> 2:11:36.560]  but you want to fight, you better believe, you got one.
[2:11:36.560 --> 2:11:43.560]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones.
[2:11:53.560 --> 2:11:55.560]  You know, it's crazy to get to this point.
[2:11:55.560 --> 2:11:57.560]  It's very bittersweet.
[2:11:57.560 --> 2:12:00.560]  Everything we've talked about has happened just like we said it would.
[2:12:00.560 --> 2:12:02.560]  And now we have a lot of credibility, but I don't care about that.
[2:12:02.560 --> 2:12:04.560]  I care about beating the new world war.
[2:12:04.560 --> 2:12:09.560]  And it's because we have so much credibility, they can't allow us to stay on air much longer.
[2:12:09.560 --> 2:12:12.560]  And I don't have time to tell you all the stuff they're doing to us.
[2:12:12.560 --> 2:12:14.560]  For a lot of reasons, I can't tell you what's going on.
[2:12:14.560 --> 2:12:17.560]  But let's just say this, we're going to see this through the end,
[2:12:17.560 --> 2:12:19.560]  where it's stay on air as long as we can.
[2:12:19.560 --> 2:12:22.560]  So please pray for us and please buy the products.
[2:12:22.560 --> 2:12:24.560]  And then infowars.com, they're great products.
[2:12:24.560 --> 2:12:26.560]  Plus, they fund the operation.
[2:12:26.560 --> 2:12:29.560]  So you know, unlike other products you can buy, they're still great.
[2:12:29.560 --> 2:12:30.560]  Do they fund freedom?
[2:12:30.560 --> 2:12:31.560]  No, a lot of them don't.
[2:12:31.560 --> 2:12:34.560]  These are great products that fund freedom and fund justice
[2:12:34.560 --> 2:12:37.560]  when the whole world's waking up and looking for truth.
[2:12:37.560 --> 2:12:39.560]  That's why the globalists are censoring.
[2:12:39.560 --> 2:12:42.560]  They can't bring in all this tyranny and leave people like us on the air.
[2:12:42.560 --> 2:12:45.560]  So while you're at it, don't just financially support us and spread the word.
[2:12:45.560 --> 2:12:48.560]  Download everything we've done you can find and save it.
[2:12:48.560 --> 2:12:50.560]  Because who knows how long we're going to be on the air
[2:12:50.560 --> 2:12:53.560]  and the enemy is trying to destroy everything we ever said.
[2:12:53.560 --> 2:12:55.560]  So what's the most important part?
[2:12:55.560 --> 2:12:57.560]  Let's say in a bulldozer running over the globalist.
[2:12:57.560 --> 2:13:00.560]  The treads, the wheels, the engine, the scoop on the front.
[2:13:00.560 --> 2:13:03.560]  It's all very important, but the fuel is paramount.
[2:13:03.560 --> 2:13:05.560]  And that's my allegor.
[2:13:05.560 --> 2:13:09.560]  Turboforce is vitamins, minerals, amino acids that synergistically work
[2:13:09.560 --> 2:13:12.560]  with six different natural forms of healthy clean energy
[2:13:12.560 --> 2:13:16.560]  that last for 10 hours in the average metabolic system, metabolism of a human.
[2:13:16.560 --> 2:13:18.560]  Some people get 15 hours out of this.
[2:13:18.560 --> 2:13:19.560]  Some people get about 8 hours.
[2:13:19.560 --> 2:13:20.560]  But people take this.
[2:13:20.560 --> 2:13:21.560]  People are taking sports.
[2:13:21.560 --> 2:13:24.560]  People cannot believe it's the best they've ever had because it's not high.
[2:13:24.560 --> 2:13:28.560]  Nobody puts as much product into their pre-workouts,
[2:13:28.560 --> 2:13:30.560]  their post-workouts, you can call us whatever you want.
[2:13:30.560 --> 2:13:33.560]  It's a total solution all around the best you're going to find.
[2:13:33.560 --> 2:13:36.560]  Turboforce, without you, we don't roll.
[2:13:36.560 --> 2:13:38.560]  With you, we search forward together.
[2:13:38.560 --> 2:13:40.560]  It's like the bulldozer without the diesel fuel.
[2:13:40.560 --> 2:13:43.560]  If we don't have your financial support, we will be defeated.
[2:13:43.560 --> 2:13:46.560]  You support us to get products you already need that literally fuel your body and your mind.
[2:13:46.560 --> 2:13:48.560]  It's a win-win 360 together.
[2:13:48.560 --> 2:13:53.560]  Infowarsstore.com or AAA-253-3139.
[2:13:53.560 --> 2:13:59.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:13:59.560 --> 2:14:24.560]  Infowars, the most banned network in the world.
[2:14:24.560 --> 2:14:28.560]  Again, thank you for joining us on this live global transmission.
[2:14:28.560 --> 2:14:32.560]  The only way this information gets out of the general public is when you share it.
[2:14:32.560 --> 2:14:35.560]  When you tell people about those local radio stations or local TV stations,
[2:14:35.560 --> 2:14:38.560]  when you support those stations and when you tell them about Bandai Video
[2:14:38.560 --> 2:14:42.560]  and Infowars.com and share the articles, the videos, the links on hundreds of important topics,
[2:14:42.560 --> 2:14:44.560]  whatever you think is most important, please amplify it.
[2:14:44.560 --> 2:14:45.560]  We're all counting on you.
[2:14:45.560 --> 2:14:46.560]  We're all in this together.
[2:14:46.560 --> 2:14:48.560]  Again, this is the Alex Jones show.
[2:14:48.560 --> 2:14:50.560]  Gregory is coming up with some key intel.
[2:14:50.560 --> 2:14:52.560]  I'll tell you about it in just a moment.
[2:14:52.560 --> 2:14:56.560]  But first, UNIX went on in lots of different cultures of the world.
[2:14:56.560 --> 2:14:58.560]  Egypt did it. Babylon did it.
[2:14:58.560 --> 2:15:01.560]  The Arabs did it. The Muslims do it.
[2:15:01.560 --> 2:15:06.560]  This is a big thing where enslaved men are castrated as boys.
[2:15:06.560 --> 2:15:12.560]  They even had some of the European famous operas and famous choirs.
[2:15:12.560 --> 2:15:19.560]  The young boys at about age 11, they opt to be able to still sing high to have their genitals removed.
[2:15:19.560 --> 2:15:25.560]  This is a real sick cult that's been going on for a long, long time.
[2:15:25.560 --> 2:15:29.560]  This has been happening for thousands of years in many different cultures,
[2:15:29.560 --> 2:15:35.560]  but now it's been chosen as a way to depopulate people that have already been damaged
[2:15:35.560 --> 2:15:40.560]  or who are brain damaged from the vaccines, from the pesticides, and a cocktail with a reasons.
[2:15:40.560 --> 2:15:43.560]  So now enter this individual.
[2:15:43.560 --> 2:15:45.560]  This is just one snapshot example.
[2:15:45.560 --> 2:15:52.560]  Gender therapy doctor admits to advising kids to fake being suicidal to get transgender treatments.
[2:15:52.560 --> 2:15:57.560]  And they're now saying because transgender are the highest level of HIV, of drug use, of suicide,
[2:15:57.560 --> 2:16:03.560]  it's the Christian's fault for not celebrating autistic children they've already captured,
[2:16:03.560 --> 2:16:06.560]  brainwashed, and then sexually mutilated.
[2:16:06.560 --> 2:16:09.560]  So it's not the people that did this to them and ruined their lives.
[2:16:09.560 --> 2:16:10.560]  No, no, no.
[2:16:10.560 --> 2:16:15.560]  It's those of us that tried to stop girls being given very dangerous chemicals to sterilize them.
[2:16:15.560 --> 2:16:18.560]  And little boys even being surgically sterilized by the millions.
[2:16:18.560 --> 2:16:26.560]  Gender therapy doctor, it's Dr. Wallace Wong is facing calls for an investigation in him.
[2:16:26.560 --> 2:16:34.560]  He has a meeting at the Vancouver Public Library where he talks about how he does gender therapy practice
[2:16:34.560 --> 2:16:39.560]  that a few years ago only had a few pupils in his outreach.
[2:16:39.560 --> 2:16:45.560]  It goes on to say that noting that his youngest client is not yet three years old
[2:16:45.560 --> 2:16:51.560]  and that he has 501 orphans and foster kids in his local practice.
[2:16:51.560 --> 2:16:53.560]  Remember what happened in the UK?
[2:16:53.560 --> 2:16:57.560]  They knew the Muslims were grooming tens of thousands of girls, selling them for sex as young as five.
[2:16:57.560 --> 2:16:58.560]  They covered it up.
[2:16:58.560 --> 2:17:00.560]  Remember what they did in Germany?
[2:17:00.560 --> 2:17:07.560]  Thousands of children over 30 years per city given to pedophiles who would then use them as pedophile prostitutes
[2:17:07.560 --> 2:17:10.560]  to make money and money paid back to the state.
[2:17:10.560 --> 2:17:15.560]  That's all confirmed, that's in plain view and Google, Facebook, Twitter censor this because at the top
[2:17:15.560 --> 2:17:18.560]  most of them are pedophiles, this is a cult.
[2:17:18.560 --> 2:17:23.560]  You don't get into the club unless you vampirically destroy the future of children.
[2:17:23.560 --> 2:17:29.560]  So again, this individual only wants to remove their genitals or chemically castrate them.
[2:17:29.560 --> 2:17:32.560]  So it's one thing to rape children, that's bad enough.
[2:17:32.560 --> 2:17:39.560]  But imagine chemically having the genitals removed or physically having them cut out.
[2:17:39.560 --> 2:17:44.560]  This is just absolutely sick, totally abusive in my view and out of control,
[2:17:44.560 --> 2:17:46.560]  but it's all sold as empowering children.
[2:17:46.560 --> 2:17:53.560]  And look, just like Bill Gates, he's wearing a pink sweater and he's so nice, he's very effeminate
[2:17:53.560 --> 2:17:57.560]  because he was a big man saying, I want your children's genitals, I want your children's sterilized.
[2:17:57.560 --> 2:17:59.560]  People stand up and say, this is a creep.
[2:17:59.560 --> 2:18:03.560]  If a guy showed up in a park and talked to your daughter or someone, they were five,
[2:18:03.560 --> 2:18:08.560]  about their genitals, you'd get mad, you'd call the police, but now it's a psychologist, it's a doctor.
[2:18:08.560 --> 2:18:13.560]  Through the health department coming to help your children, the same health departments
[2:18:13.560 --> 2:18:20.560]  that sterilized millions of Native Americans in Canada and the U.S. and blacks and poor whites and others.
[2:18:20.560 --> 2:18:22.560]  It's the same system.
[2:18:22.560 --> 2:18:29.560]  Oh, my post-surgery uncle, they learn all about getting HIV and having the red ribbons.
[2:18:29.560 --> 2:18:31.560]  Isn't it all just so sweet?
[2:18:31.560 --> 2:18:35.560]  When Kathy is Keith, how the girl becomes a boy.
[2:18:35.560 --> 2:18:39.560]  And of course, that's what chemicals. It isn't creepy or all.
[2:18:39.560 --> 2:18:44.560]  This guy isn't scary, so that's how this whole system works.
[2:18:44.560 --> 2:18:46.560]  And what's more abusive?
[2:18:46.560 --> 2:18:50.560]  Children being delivered to be gang-riped or children having their testicles actually cut off
[2:18:50.560 --> 2:18:55.560]  or chemically sterilized that causes cancer and all sorts of other health problems and stunts their growth.
[2:18:55.560 --> 2:18:57.560]  This is nightmarish.
[2:18:57.560 --> 2:19:01.560]  It's one thing if somebody doesn't have growth hormone, so you give a little boy or girl growth hormones
[2:19:01.560 --> 2:19:03.560]  so they can grow up to a normal height.
[2:19:03.560 --> 2:19:06.560]  Hormone therapies that the parents opt into.
[2:19:06.560 --> 2:19:11.560]  But to have disadvantaged children captured by the state taken out of good homes and bad homes
[2:19:11.560 --> 2:19:18.560]  and then put into a system where he has 501 children that all get together and peer pressure each other
[2:19:18.560 --> 2:19:21.560]  to decide, I'm a boy when I was a girl.
[2:19:21.560 --> 2:19:23.560]  I'm a girl when I was a boy.
[2:19:23.560 --> 2:19:26.560]  This is abuse of the highest magnitude.
[2:19:26.560 --> 2:19:28.560]  And this is the true evil taking place.
[2:19:28.560 --> 2:19:30.560]  So it's time to stand up to these bullies.
[2:19:30.560 --> 2:19:33.560]  It's time to say that men should be able to take over women's sports.
[2:19:33.560 --> 2:19:39.560]  It's time to realize that appeasing this isn't being open and liberal and nice and progressive.
[2:19:39.560 --> 2:19:43.560]  It's progressive in a bad way like cancer spreading through a body.
[2:19:43.560 --> 2:19:48.560]  And it's got the biggest corporations, the biggest banks, and the biggest authoritarian systems backing it
[2:19:48.560 --> 2:19:52.560]  because it's a depopulation, destruction of the family takeover program.
[2:19:52.560 --> 2:19:56.560]  They admit that it's meant to bring down the world's population.
[2:19:56.560 --> 2:20:01.560]  And to do that, you've got to annihilate families, you've got to annihilate family groups, community groups
[2:20:01.560 --> 2:20:03.560]  that can stand up and defend each other.
[2:20:03.560 --> 2:20:06.560]  This is a corporate takeover of the very biology of humans.
[2:20:06.560 --> 2:20:12.560]  By 2047, the UN even estimates that there will be almost no men that have sperm anymore
[2:20:12.560 --> 2:20:15.560]  that will get a woman pregnant that will fertilize an egg.
[2:20:15.560 --> 2:20:16.560]  We're here.
[2:20:16.560 --> 2:20:21.560]  So now all babies will have to be designer and will be a splice they make in a lab.
[2:20:21.560 --> 2:20:26.560]  The future is here and it's a nightmare and we need to say no and stop letting the Bill Gates
[2:20:26.560 --> 2:20:29.560]  and the Klaus Schwab's and the Communist Chinese in the world running.
[2:20:29.560 --> 2:20:36.560]  Now coming up, Gregory said a great job with his Illuminati Unmask, Illuminati Unveiled report.
[2:20:36.560 --> 2:20:43.560]  And then that brought a lot of folks out of the woodwork saying, oh my gosh, Alex Jones's occupower pills
[2:20:43.560 --> 2:20:46.560]  but I think we don't even have anymore, have an eye on them.
[2:20:46.560 --> 2:20:47.560]  That means Illuminati.
[2:20:47.560 --> 2:20:49.560]  No, that means it's for your eyes.
[2:20:49.560 --> 2:20:52.560]  Or look, the silver bullet looks like a male genital.
[2:20:52.560 --> 2:20:53.560]  No, that's a bullet.
[2:20:53.560 --> 2:20:59.560]  So just because the Illuminati uses symbols like the sun rising or the tree of life or things like that,
[2:20:59.560 --> 2:21:02.560]  just because we use symbols doesn't mean we're with the Illuminati.
[2:21:02.560 --> 2:21:06.560]  Jesus says, judge a tree by its fruits.
[2:21:06.560 --> 2:21:07.560]  I snuck into Bohemian Grove.
[2:21:07.560 --> 2:21:09.560]  I have exposed sculling bones.
[2:21:09.560 --> 2:21:14.560]  I love Jesus Christ, but I'm not a Pharisee telling you everybody's going to hell but me.
[2:21:14.560 --> 2:21:19.560]  And so in a part two, we're going to explain how George Washington could be good,
[2:21:19.560 --> 2:21:24.560]  but how Masonry could be pretty bad now because the darker forces the Illuminati took it over.
[2:21:24.560 --> 2:21:27.560]  Freemasonry predates Christianity, even Judaism.
[2:21:27.560 --> 2:21:31.560]  It was a college of all thought and all systems.
[2:21:31.560 --> 2:21:33.560]  Alchemy, occultism, you name it.
[2:21:33.560 --> 2:21:35.560]  And so that's really what Masonry is.
[2:21:35.560 --> 2:21:37.560]  Has it been taken over by the modern Illuminati?
[2:21:37.560 --> 2:21:38.560]  Yes.
[2:21:38.560 --> 2:21:39.560]  Is there another Illuminati?
[2:21:39.560 --> 2:21:41.560]  Anybody that loves God is Illuminated.
[2:21:41.560 --> 2:21:44.560]  And it's not a secret organization.
[2:21:44.560 --> 2:21:45.560]  It's a relationship with God.
[2:21:45.560 --> 2:21:47.560]  With Satan, everything is an inversion.
[2:21:47.560 --> 2:21:49.560]  Everything is the opposite.
[2:21:49.560 --> 2:21:51.560]  Everything is upside down.
[2:21:51.560 --> 2:21:55.560]  And then Satan claims credit for everything God's done.
[2:21:55.560 --> 2:21:56.560]  Like, take this.
[2:21:56.560 --> 2:21:57.560]  God gave us life.
[2:21:57.560 --> 2:22:00.560]  God gave us women and gave women men.
[2:22:00.560 --> 2:22:06.560]  And the enjoyment of sex and food and life and sunshine and beauty, that came from God.
[2:22:06.560 --> 2:22:09.560]  The average Satanist advertises that sex and fun comes from them.
[2:22:09.560 --> 2:22:15.560]  No, God gave it to us in the place of marriage to be strong and to enjoy each other and to have communion.
[2:22:15.560 --> 2:22:17.560]  That's what this is all about.
[2:22:17.560 --> 2:22:19.560]  So, oh, Alex Jones has sex.
[2:22:19.560 --> 2:22:20.560]  He's a Satanist.
[2:22:20.560 --> 2:22:21.560]  What?
[2:22:21.560 --> 2:22:23.560]  Or Alex Jones has videos with the sun rising over the earth.
[2:22:23.560 --> 2:22:24.560]  Oh, that's Satanism.
[2:22:24.560 --> 2:22:26.560]  No, that's a symbol of beauty in a new day.
[2:22:26.560 --> 2:22:28.560]  And in Christ has risen.
[2:22:28.560 --> 2:22:29.560]  Not Lucifer.
[2:22:29.560 --> 2:22:31.560]  So they invert everything we do.
[2:22:31.560 --> 2:22:33.560]  We flip it back straight up.
[2:22:33.560 --> 2:22:35.560]  Gregory's just coming up to talk about that.
[2:22:35.560 --> 2:22:39.560]  The next segment will air his amazing report going viral at man.video.
[2:22:39.560 --> 2:22:41.560]  And then we've got a big guest host in the fourth hour.
[2:22:41.560 --> 2:22:42.560]  I'm Alex Jones.
[2:22:42.560 --> 2:23:10.560]  This is the info war tomorrow's news today.
[2:23:10.560 --> 2:23:13.560]  You're trying to destroy all independent forms of media.
[2:23:13.560 --> 2:23:16.560]  They're trying to shutter and silence human resistance.
[2:23:16.560 --> 2:23:21.560]  So now is the time to understand that everything we've talked about has been proven accurate.
[2:23:21.560 --> 2:23:24.560]  Everything you warned your friends and family about is around to be true.
[2:23:24.560 --> 2:23:27.560]  So it's now that your credibility is way up.
[2:23:27.560 --> 2:23:31.560]  The power structures are to silence those of us that they can.
[2:23:31.560 --> 2:23:36.560]  But it's up to all of us to not let them silence any of us.
[2:23:36.560 --> 2:23:38.560]  We have the power.
[2:23:38.560 --> 2:23:42.560]  But the sun is setting on humanity and setting on free speech.
[2:23:42.560 --> 2:23:48.560]  We have to make sure that we find hard right now to make sure that a long dark night doesn't come.
[2:23:48.560 --> 2:23:53.560]  So be the polar bears you are.
[2:23:53.560 --> 2:24:01.560]  Your brain, your heart, your bones, your liver, your eyes, everything.
[2:24:01.560 --> 2:24:05.560]  Has a better shot at surviving in this crazy environment when you have high quality fish oil.
[2:24:05.560 --> 2:24:06.560]  We've got the best out there.
[2:24:06.560 --> 2:24:09.560]  We have the highest grade of fish oil available.
[2:24:09.560 --> 2:24:11.560]  And what it does for your body is simply amazing.
[2:24:11.560 --> 2:24:13.560]  Everybody already knows what high quality fish oil does.
[2:24:13.560 --> 2:24:17.560]  And it costs us even more to put it through a process to remove any trace mercury that's in it.
[2:24:17.560 --> 2:24:19.560]  So this is also clean fish oil.
[2:24:19.560 --> 2:24:22.560]  It's been sold out for months, but it's back in stock 50% off.
[2:24:22.560 --> 2:24:24.560]  Grill oil is set to sell out.
[2:24:24.560 --> 2:24:25.560]  It's amazing as well.
[2:24:25.560 --> 2:24:27.560]  It's at 25% off.
[2:24:27.560 --> 2:24:31.560]  But when you get them both together in a combo, it's 50% off as well.

[2:24:54.560 --> 2:24:57.560]  I 1 trillion percent believe what I'm saying.
[2:24:57.560 --> 2:24:58.560]  Hell, everybody knows that.
[2:24:58.560 --> 2:25:00.560]  I just tell you what I'm really thinking.
[2:25:00.560 --> 2:25:02.560]  People say, well, Jones, why the hell did you just say that on air?
[2:25:02.560 --> 2:25:03.560]  That's embarrassing.
[2:25:03.560 --> 2:25:06.560]  Well, I'm not going to stop with only the good stuff about me.
[2:25:06.560 --> 2:25:11.560]  But I'll tell you this right now, you're nuts if you don't get storeable food.
[2:25:11.560 --> 2:25:15.560]  And I've got the biggest best sponsor with the highest quality food and the lowest price
[2:25:15.560 --> 2:25:16.560]  you're going to find.
[2:25:16.560 --> 2:25:21.560]  Can you spend triple or four times it and get gourmet stuff that tastes even better?
[2:25:21.560 --> 2:25:22.560]  Yeah.
[2:25:22.560 --> 2:25:23.560]  Most of the stuff tastes amazing.
[2:25:23.560 --> 2:25:24.560]  Some of it tastes okay.
[2:25:24.560 --> 2:25:27.560]  The point is, it's high quality, it's nutritious, and it lasts a long time.
[2:25:27.560 --> 2:25:31.560]  And compared to other competitors, they can't even get close.
[2:25:31.560 --> 2:25:33.560]  They've got three months, six months.
[2:25:33.560 --> 2:25:38.560]  Your supplies right now, and I twisted their arms so hard to give you 10 percent off again

[2:25:53.560 --> 2:26:00.560]  It is a big idea, a new world order.
[2:26:00.560 --> 2:26:05.560]  In the near future, Earth is dominated by a powerful world government.
[2:26:05.560 --> 2:26:08.560]  It's known as the Bilderberg.
[2:26:08.560 --> 2:26:11.560]  Could their objective be world domination?
[2:26:11.560 --> 2:26:14.560]  For thousands of years, their dark order grew.
[2:26:14.560 --> 2:26:20.560]  Now as they hail the birth of the new world order, their great dream of exterminating 80 percent
[2:26:20.560 --> 2:26:22.560]  of humanity is in hand.
[2:26:22.560 --> 2:26:25.560]  The globalist feared this film made 14 years ago.
[2:26:25.560 --> 2:26:27.560]  It is the blueprint for their plan to take over the world.
[2:26:27.560 --> 2:26:29.560]  It is the blueprint for the great reset.
[2:26:29.560 --> 2:26:33.560]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement, available right now at infowarstore.com
[2:26:33.560 --> 2:26:37.560]  with a zero country code meaning you can make copies of it anywhere in the world.
[2:26:37.560 --> 2:26:39.560]  I strongly suggest you get the film.
[2:26:39.560 --> 2:26:41.560]  Endgame at infowarstore.com.
[2:26:41.560 --> 2:26:43.560]  I strongly suggest you make copies and share it.
[2:26:43.560 --> 2:26:47.560]  And if you take that action, I demand you tell others you've given a copy to
[2:26:47.560 --> 2:26:49.560]  that they make copies and share it as well.
[2:26:49.560 --> 2:26:56.560]  That will trigger distribution by proxy, meaning we the people cannot be stopped.
[2:26:56.560 --> 2:27:00.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:27:00.560 --> 2:27:26.560]  You are watching the Alex Jones show.
[2:27:26.560 --> 2:27:31.560]  I'm your guest host for this segment, Greg Reese.
[2:27:31.560 --> 2:27:36.560]  As a response to a lot of interesting comments we got in controversies,
[2:27:36.560 --> 2:27:43.560]  including comments about the skull and the dagger, I was asked this morning to come on and talk.
[2:27:43.560 --> 2:27:44.560]  And it's a great honor.
[2:27:44.560 --> 2:27:47.560]  It's a subject that I'm very excited to talk about.
[2:27:47.560 --> 2:27:52.560]  Very rarely am I asked to do anything.
[2:27:52.560 --> 2:27:54.560]  That's one of the best things about my job here.
[2:27:54.560 --> 2:27:56.560]  I've been working here this July.
[2:27:56.560 --> 2:27:58.560]  It'll be three years.
[2:27:58.560 --> 2:28:04.560]  And I was very surprised when I showed up that basically I was set up with a computer.
[2:28:04.560 --> 2:28:12.560]  And the basic instructions I was given by Rob Dew was pick a subject, make a report, upload it.
[2:28:12.560 --> 2:28:18.560]  I had the blessing of uploading to our YouTube channel once before we were shut off a week after I got the job.
[2:28:18.560 --> 2:28:20.560]  And that's been my job ever since.
[2:28:20.560 --> 2:28:25.560]  I never had a job quite like this where I had the freedom to do and say what I want to say.
[2:28:25.560 --> 2:28:32.560]  I think in the three years, almost three years I've been here, there was definitely once that I was given direction.
[2:28:32.560 --> 2:28:37.560]  The history of Bill Gates and Eugenics, I can't remember the exact title.
[2:28:37.560 --> 2:28:40.560]  That was given to me by Jones.
[2:28:40.560 --> 2:28:46.560]  He just came in and kind of rattled off a bunch of notes and then I researched it all and put that together.
[2:28:46.560 --> 2:28:51.560]  And I believe there's a couple other times where he handed me something casually and whatnot.
[2:28:51.560 --> 2:28:54.560]  But other than that, I get to do what I want.
[2:28:54.560 --> 2:28:58.560]  And so it was a great honor that he called me this morning and said, you know, we're getting all these comments.
[2:28:58.560 --> 2:28:59.560]  It's a lot of controversy.
[2:28:59.560 --> 2:29:01.560]  It's a great time to have a conversation about this.
[2:29:01.560 --> 2:29:03.560]  So why don't you come on and talk about it?
[2:29:03.560 --> 2:29:04.560]  So here I am.
[2:29:04.560 --> 2:29:05.560]  I got some notes.
[2:29:05.560 --> 2:29:08.560]  This is something I could talk about forever, so I'm going to try to keep it quick.
[2:29:08.560 --> 2:29:10.560]  I have quite a bit of experience in this.
[2:29:10.560 --> 2:29:17.560]  I would say technically, I think you could say I'm an expert on religion, the occult and all religious traditions.
[2:29:17.560 --> 2:29:20.560]  It's something I've been fascinated with my whole life.
[2:29:20.560 --> 2:29:24.560]  Before I came here, I spent about close to 15 years traveling around.
[2:29:24.560 --> 2:29:29.560]  I was living in monasteries and ashrams and studying all kinds of things.
[2:29:29.560 --> 2:29:32.560]  I was born and raised Christian.
[2:29:32.560 --> 2:29:35.560]  I have a very close and personal relationship.
[2:29:35.560 --> 2:29:38.560]  And it's something I consider to be very private.
[2:29:38.560 --> 2:29:40.560]  That's something we're going to get into in this conversation.
[2:29:40.560 --> 2:29:42.560]  So here we go.
[2:29:42.560 --> 2:29:46.560]  I knew when I made this report that it was going to get very controversial.
[2:29:46.560 --> 2:29:53.560]  This report was simply based on a five-hour confession of the Australian pop singer.
[2:29:53.560 --> 2:29:59.560]  And the whole time I was doing it, I was thinking if I was actually doing a report on the Freemasons and the Illuminati,
[2:29:59.560 --> 2:30:01.560]  it would be a bit different than this.
[2:30:01.560 --> 2:30:02.560]  There would be other things mentioned.
[2:30:02.560 --> 2:30:06.560]  A lot of the things in the comments that people were mentioning are things that I absolutely would have put in the report.
[2:30:06.560 --> 2:30:08.560]  And we are going to do a second report on that.
[2:30:08.560 --> 2:30:09.560]  That will be our report.
[2:30:09.560 --> 2:30:11.560]  This was a report on a five.
[2:30:11.560 --> 2:30:16.560]  This was a boil down to save you five hours to watch what this guy was saying in 10 minutes, which I find to be fascinating.
[2:30:16.560 --> 2:30:18.560]  I've always found this information to be very fascinating.
[2:30:18.560 --> 2:30:27.560]  And you're a bit foolish if you think that the Satanic Luciferian agenda does not have an extremely organized structure.
[2:30:27.560 --> 2:30:29.560]  It's well hidden.
[2:30:29.560 --> 2:30:31.560]  I certainly don't know all the answers.
[2:30:31.560 --> 2:30:33.560]  I hardly know anything.
[2:30:33.560 --> 2:30:40.560]  The one thing I do know, and this was the most true comment that I read on the comment stream of the video,
[2:30:40.560 --> 2:30:42.560]  is that it's all about the struggle of good versus evil.
[2:30:42.560 --> 2:30:48.560]  That's about the limit of my knowledge, is that it's all the struggle of good versus evil.
[2:30:48.560 --> 2:30:51.560]  And I believe my faith tells me that everything is God.
[2:30:51.560 --> 2:30:55.560]  Everything in this world is God.
[2:30:55.560 --> 2:31:00.560]  And so therefore evil is a part of God.
[2:31:00.560 --> 2:31:05.560]  Everyone, a lot of atheists will say, if God's real, why does God let bad things happen?
[2:31:05.560 --> 2:31:08.560]  Well, the answer is easy, because we're not here to live in the Garden of Eden.
[2:31:08.560 --> 2:31:10.560]  We're here to grow and learn from our experiences.
[2:31:10.560 --> 2:31:12.560]  We're here to learn.
[2:31:12.560 --> 2:31:16.560]  And how is the best way to learn is by experiencing suffering, bad things happening.
[2:31:16.560 --> 2:31:17.560]  And then what do we do?
[2:31:17.560 --> 2:31:20.560]  You can either play the victim, which we know all about these days,
[2:31:20.560 --> 2:31:29.560]  or you can look within, you can humble yourself and go to God and illuminate yourself.
[2:31:29.560 --> 2:31:31.560]  You know, I was born curious.
[2:31:31.560 --> 2:31:32.560]  I was born faithful.
[2:31:32.560 --> 2:31:34.560]  I'm very, very grateful for that.
[2:31:34.560 --> 2:31:37.560]  I never was much of a churchgoer.
[2:31:37.560 --> 2:31:40.560]  I was raised in a Catholic church, and there was quite a bit of pedo priests where I went.
[2:31:40.560 --> 2:31:45.560]  And at a very young age, I became very distrustful of organized religion.
[2:31:45.560 --> 2:31:47.560]  I found my relationship within.
[2:31:47.560 --> 2:31:51.560]  And this is a rant, so we would love to have a discussion.
[2:31:51.560 --> 2:31:55.560]  I would love to have a discussion with anyone, but I'm going to be ranting here for another only five minutes,
[2:31:55.560 --> 2:31:56.560]  so I better get through this.
[2:31:56.560 --> 2:32:03.560]  But when I was a child, I remember seeing the all-seeing eye.
[2:32:03.560 --> 2:32:04.560]  It's on the dollar bill.
[2:32:04.560 --> 2:32:06.560]  You grow up seeing it.
[2:32:06.560 --> 2:32:10.560]  And symbols aren't owned by anyone.
[2:32:10.560 --> 2:32:16.560]  A symbol is, you interpret a symbol based on your filter, on your psychological filter.
[2:32:16.560 --> 2:32:19.560]  So when I first saw that, clearly I thought of God.
[2:32:19.560 --> 2:32:20.560]  It's at the top of the pyramid.
[2:32:20.560 --> 2:32:21.560]  It's above all.
[2:32:21.560 --> 2:32:22.560]  It's looking down on us all.
[2:32:22.560 --> 2:32:25.560]  It seemed deeply spiritual to me.
[2:32:25.560 --> 2:32:29.560]  So when I would look at that symbol, I would see God.
[2:32:29.560 --> 2:32:30.560]  I would see goodness in that.
[2:32:30.560 --> 2:32:37.560]  Later on in life, as I got older, and I started watching the Freemason conspiracy videos and the Illuminati videos,
[2:32:37.560 --> 2:32:44.560]  I was told that that symbol is evil, and that symbol represents Satan.
[2:32:44.560 --> 2:32:50.560]  And there was a time when I would look at that symbol, then that's how I perceived it.
[2:32:50.560 --> 2:32:53.560]  I then perceived it as if I'm looking at something evil.
[2:32:53.560 --> 2:32:55.560]  Now think about that.
[2:32:55.560 --> 2:33:00.560]  This is really the only power that they have is playing with our minds.
[2:33:00.560 --> 2:33:06.560]  The great writer, in my opinion, Robert Anton Wilson, another controversial subject, definitely an occultist,
[2:33:06.560 --> 2:33:11.560]  a writer of Prometheus Rising and the Cosmic Trigger, two great books.
[2:33:11.560 --> 2:33:14.560]  He is very illuminating when he teaches you about the mind.
[2:33:14.560 --> 2:33:21.560]  One of his things that he talks about all the time is what the thinker thinks the prover proves.
[2:33:21.560 --> 2:33:23.560]  And he goes on to have different experiments you can do.
[2:33:23.560 --> 2:33:30.560]  And basically what it shows you is if anyone has belief in something, then you know that you see it in this world.
[2:33:30.560 --> 2:33:32.560]  And we often interpret that as evidence.
[2:33:32.560 --> 2:33:39.560]  If we believe something and then we see, you know, if we believe that we're going to see a quarter, this is maybe a silly example,
[2:33:39.560 --> 2:33:46.560]  if we believe we're going to find a quarter and we find it, then we might interpret that as, well, that means that God's speaking to me,
[2:33:46.560 --> 2:33:49.560]  and that means I'm right, that's an answer to my, but that's not the case.
[2:33:49.560 --> 2:33:54.560]  And there are excellent examples in his book where he gives you practices.
[2:33:54.560 --> 2:33:57.560]  You can practice this in your own life, you can practice changing your own belief system,
[2:33:57.560 --> 2:34:02.560]  and notice that you will then start seeing things as if the universe or God is telling you, yeah, you're right.
[2:34:02.560 --> 2:34:07.560]  No, that's just the way the mind works, and they know that, so they can take these symbols and invert them.
[2:34:07.560 --> 2:34:14.560]  They can take all that is good and make it bad, and that is exactly the goal, and we all kind of notice.
[2:34:14.560 --> 2:34:17.560]  I mean, we're all kind of waking up.
[2:34:17.560 --> 2:34:20.560]  That means we're all becoming illuminated.
[2:34:20.560 --> 2:34:23.560]  That's just a word, that's describing that.
[2:34:23.560 --> 2:34:26.560]  There is no evil in a word.
[2:34:26.560 --> 2:34:32.560]  That's another thing Robert Anton wasn't kind of joked about, is he said, maybe the Illuminati is just simply made up of all of us,
[2:34:32.560 --> 2:34:37.560]  once we become aware of these truths, and these truths, these are of God.
[2:34:37.560 --> 2:34:43.560]  Everything in the world is of God, you know, that's my belief, but I find it impossible for you to tell me otherwise.
[2:34:43.560 --> 2:34:48.560]  And so therefore, we see in the symbols what we want to see.
[2:34:48.560 --> 2:34:53.560]  We're seeing it through our own filter.
[2:34:53.560 --> 2:34:56.560]  And what's the beauty of this connection?
[2:34:56.560 --> 2:34:58.560]  Why form this personal connection?
[2:34:58.560 --> 2:35:05.560]  Well, another thing I learned in my journeys, this is taught in the Yoga Sutras, which is another great scripture,
[2:35:05.560 --> 2:35:07.560]  is how do you know things?
[2:35:07.560 --> 2:35:08.560]  How do you know the truth?
[2:35:08.560 --> 2:35:10.560]  They call it right knowledge.
[2:35:10.560 --> 2:35:13.560]  And there's three ways, according to the Yoga Sutras, to get right knowledge.
[2:35:13.560 --> 2:35:16.560]  There is direct experience, inference, and verbal testimony.
[2:35:16.560 --> 2:35:23.560]  Direct experience is the best, and this is when you experience it for yourself, when you see it with your own two eyes, when you know it.
[2:35:23.560 --> 2:35:25.560]  Inference is when you're using logic.
[2:35:25.560 --> 2:35:31.560]  You're taking what you've seen already, and then you're applying logic, and you're inferring, well, maybe this is what's happening.
[2:35:31.560 --> 2:35:35.560]  And verbal testimony is the worst of the three, and that's when you're just hearing it from someone else.
[2:35:35.560 --> 2:35:36.560]  So what does this tell you?
[2:35:36.560 --> 2:35:40.560]  This tells you that you want to experience the truth for yourself.
[2:35:40.560 --> 2:35:43.560]  That's the direct experience.
[2:35:43.560 --> 2:35:45.560]  So the direct experience of God, how do you achieve that?
[2:35:45.560 --> 2:35:46.560]  I don't believe you achieve it in a church.
[2:35:46.560 --> 2:35:48.560]  I don't believe you achieve it through a third party.
[2:35:48.560 --> 2:35:55.560]  I believe you achieve it going within and asking, humbling yourself.
[2:35:55.560 --> 2:35:57.560]  And it's very private.
[2:35:57.560 --> 2:36:05.560]  It's something I really never talk about, at least on air like this or something like that, although it's the most important part of my life.
[2:36:05.560 --> 2:36:09.560]  It saved me through my calamity, through my suffering.
[2:36:09.560 --> 2:36:11.560]  It's the only thing that saved me.
[2:36:11.560 --> 2:36:22.560]  And what we're seeing today with all the inversion of everything is it's simply creating fear and confusion.
[2:36:22.560 --> 2:36:24.560]  There's no reason to be afraid.
[2:36:24.560 --> 2:36:26.560]  The only power these people have is doing that.
[2:36:26.560 --> 2:36:27.560]  They are these psiops.
[2:36:27.560 --> 2:36:33.560]  You know, in the beauty of illumination, Alex gave a really good example when I was talking this morning,
[2:36:33.560 --> 2:36:37.560]  is he's like, when you throw a dart, if you don't think what you're doing, if you just go with your gut,
[2:36:37.560 --> 2:36:39.560]  go with your intuition, you'll hit a bullseye.
[2:36:39.560 --> 2:36:41.560]  And that's the same thing with the work that I do.
[2:36:41.560 --> 2:36:44.560]  I feel when I do something great, a happy accident, that is God.
[2:36:44.560 --> 2:36:46.560]  That's the grace of God.
[2:36:46.560 --> 2:36:49.560]  And that's something we can all seek without fear.
[2:36:49.560 --> 2:36:52.560]  We'll see you after the break.
[2:36:52.560 --> 2:36:55.560]  The equation is very simple.
[2:36:55.560 --> 2:36:57.560]  The mega banks control the media.
[2:36:57.560 --> 2:36:59.560]  They control big pharma.
[2:36:59.560 --> 2:37:01.560]  They control academia.
[2:37:01.560 --> 2:37:04.560]  They control the military, industrial complex.
[2:37:04.560 --> 2:37:06.560]  They control big tech.
[2:37:06.560 --> 2:37:15.560]  And everywhere that they have been in control in the third world, they have established absolute total despotism and dehumanization.
[2:37:15.560 --> 2:37:24.560]  It is the Western Christian idea of human freedom that ended slavery and that promoted women's rights and so much more that actually threatens them.
[2:37:24.560 --> 2:37:27.560]  So because they can't defeat that empowering ethic,
[2:37:27.560 --> 2:37:39.560]  they instead co-opt and turn it upside down and use the idea of equality to actually destroy human freedom and the free market that threatens their monopolies of control.
[2:37:39.560 --> 2:37:44.560]  That's why they target info wars, because we understand the keys to defeating them.
[2:37:44.560 --> 2:37:49.560]  And the only way our transmission gets out is if you promote info wars and ban that video.
[2:37:49.560 --> 2:37:52.560]  So we double your efforts. We're all in this together.
[2:37:52.560 --> 2:37:56.560]  When listeners call to the show and thank me for all I've done, I always stop them and I say,
[2:37:56.560 --> 2:37:58.560]  thank you for what you've done.
[2:37:58.560 --> 2:38:00.560]  Thank you for keeping info wars on the air.
[2:38:00.560 --> 2:38:04.560]  Thank you for praying for us and thank you for spreading the word.
[2:38:04.560 --> 2:38:11.560]  If all of you will simply go to infowarstore.com and get a privacy pocket for your iPhone or a droid,
[2:38:11.560 --> 2:38:15.560]  it will teach you and others that these things are surveilling you.
[2:38:15.560 --> 2:38:21.560]  It will remind you every day, like it does me and my family, and it will protect where you go and what you do.
[2:38:21.560 --> 2:38:27.560]  Not because you've done something wrong, but because the big telecoms, big tech and the globalist are predatory and are evil.
[2:38:27.560 --> 2:38:33.560]  And in the surveillance state, we need to more and more start doing everything we can to mitigate the criminal activity they're involved in.
[2:38:33.560 --> 2:38:36.560]  These are the highest quality, highest ratings.
[2:38:36.560 --> 2:38:41.560]  They're available at infowarstore.com in four different colors and they are only $19.95.
[2:38:41.560 --> 2:38:45.560]  The exact same pocket is sold for $24.95 or even $29.95 everywhere.
[2:38:45.560 --> 2:38:48.560]  They're available right now for $19.95 and they fund the info war.
[2:38:48.560 --> 2:38:52.560]  Please take action today, protect your privacy and fund the info war.
[2:38:52.560 --> 2:38:58.560]  Listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so saying,
[2:38:58.560 --> 2:39:02.560]  where are most of the best selling products you have that we love?
[2:39:02.560 --> 2:39:05.560]  And my answer is the supply chain has broken down.
[2:39:05.560 --> 2:39:09.560]  I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot of these.
[2:39:09.560 --> 2:39:11.560]  And so that's why we don't have a lot of products in.
[2:39:11.560 --> 2:39:16.560]  That's why info wars is in financial trouble is because if we had the product, you would be buying it, we'd have the money.
[2:39:16.560 --> 2:39:21.560]  But so many of them have been sold out just like you notice a lot of other items at the store aren't available
[2:39:21.560 --> 2:39:24.560]  because civilization is being artificially imploded.
[2:39:24.560 --> 2:39:27.560]  But finally, X2 is back in stock.
[2:39:27.560 --> 2:39:31.560]  The good halogen, deep earth crystal iodine, so essential in your body.
[2:39:31.560 --> 2:39:32.560]  It's really the missing link.
[2:39:32.560 --> 2:39:34.560]  It's 50% off.
[2:39:34.560 --> 2:39:36.560]  We've got a big shipment of it at infowarstore.com.
[2:39:36.560 --> 2:39:39.560]  Now when it gets ready to sell out, we'll have to go back to near full price,
[2:39:39.560 --> 2:39:43.560]  take advantage of this now, stock up and don't forget to take your X2.
[2:39:43.560 --> 2:39:47.560]  Because I have a tendency to forget how great it is and not take it myself.
[2:39:47.560 --> 2:39:50.560]  But when I do stamina, libido, energy, weight loss, it's incredible.
[2:39:50.560 --> 2:39:51.560]  It's essential.
[2:39:51.560 --> 2:40:20.560]  It's X2 at infowarstore.com.
[2:40:21.560 --> 2:40:27.560]  We will then go out and do what the globalists say is unpopular,
[2:40:27.560 --> 2:40:33.560]  what the globalists will target you for to show people that it's safe to tell the truth and to take the heat.
[2:40:33.560 --> 2:40:34.560]  That's our job.
[2:40:34.560 --> 2:40:41.560]  So please keep us on air so we can hit the barbed wire, so we can meet the shop groups and the information we want.
[2:40:41.560 --> 2:40:52.560]  Fundus at infowarstore.com.
[2:40:52.560 --> 2:40:56.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:40:56.560 --> 2:41:01.560]  Welcome back.
[2:41:01.560 --> 2:41:07.560]  You are watching the Alex Jones show.
[2:41:07.560 --> 2:41:12.560]  Thank you for your support. Please continue supporting us at infowarstore.com.
[2:41:12.560 --> 2:41:14.560]  Right now we have 50% off turbo force.
[2:41:14.560 --> 2:41:17.560]  I'm going to try to spit out my final thought here and then we're going to go to the video.
[2:41:17.560 --> 2:41:22.560]  So speaking of good and evil, there's good and evil in everything.
[2:41:22.560 --> 2:41:25.560]  In man, in our hearts, there's good and evil.
[2:41:25.560 --> 2:41:28.560]  That's the bottom line here.
[2:41:28.560 --> 2:41:33.560]  By inverting everything, they create fear and confusion.
[2:41:33.560 --> 2:41:39.560]  So what's the best tool that we have to fight through this other than forming a personal relationship with God?
[2:41:39.560 --> 2:41:44.560]  Well, if you're not getting clear intuition, there is a Bible passage that teaches us.
[2:41:44.560 --> 2:41:49.560]  Beware of false prophets who come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves.
[2:41:49.560 --> 2:41:52.560]  You will know them by their fruits.
[2:41:52.560 --> 2:41:59.560]  So you can look at what a person produces and you can see where their heart is.
[2:41:59.560 --> 2:42:03.560]  Obviously, we never said that all Freemasons are evil.
[2:42:03.560 --> 2:42:05.560]  If you watch the video, you'll see.
[2:42:05.560 --> 2:42:11.560]  And we're like I said, we were basically repeating what this gentleman said and everything he says we all heard before.
[2:42:11.560 --> 2:42:15.560]  And so I think that's about it.
[2:42:15.560 --> 2:42:17.560]  Like I said, I could go on and on and on.
[2:42:17.560 --> 2:42:19.560]  It's a very interesting subject to me.
[2:42:19.560 --> 2:42:21.560]  I think it's probably one of the most important subjects we're facing.
[2:42:21.560 --> 2:42:23.560]  We are going to do a video on it.
[2:42:23.560 --> 2:42:24.560]  We love the conversation.
[2:42:24.560 --> 2:42:25.560]  Thank you for watching.
[2:42:25.560 --> 2:42:26.560]  Support us.
[2:42:26.560 --> 2:42:31.560]  And now here is the controversial video, the Illuminati Unveiled.
[2:42:31.560 --> 2:42:38.560]  Lucifer, son of the morning, is that he who bears the light doubt it not.
[2:42:38.560 --> 2:42:41.560]  That's the beginning of their big secret.
[2:42:41.560 --> 2:42:53.560]  God is the devil and we're already in hell right now.
[2:42:53.560 --> 2:43:04.560]  Altion Jurick, best known as Altion Childs, is an Australian performer who topped the charts after winning the second season of X Factor Australia in 2010.
[2:43:04.560 --> 2:43:16.560]  On April 15th of this year, Altion published a five hour video claiming he was initiated into the Freemasons and that Freemasonry is hiding the true world religion, Satanism.
[2:43:16.560 --> 2:43:30.560]  He goes on to reveal how every initiate must swear a vow of secrecy to never reveal the secrets of Freemasonry to anyone whatsoever under penalty of having their body severed in two and their bowels burned to ashes.
[2:43:30.560 --> 2:43:34.560]  Their throat slit and their tongue torn out by the roots.
[2:43:34.560 --> 2:43:39.560]  This is the sign you do upon entering and exiting the ritual room while facing the grandmaster.
[2:43:39.560 --> 2:43:43.560]  It stands for throat slit and it goes like this.
[2:43:43.560 --> 2:43:56.560]  They use symbolic gestures to flaunt their secret religion, such as the sign of the master of the second veil or the hidden hand, the sign of silence.
[2:43:56.560 --> 2:44:06.560]  As you move up the ranks of Freemasonry, the oaths of silence for taking each degree become more brutal, having your heart torn out and fed to wild beasts.
[2:44:06.560 --> 2:44:16.560]  Your head struck off and placed on the highest spire of Christendom, destroying your business and reputation and hanging you in your own home.
[2:44:16.560 --> 2:44:26.560]  Masonic rules clearly stipulate that the Lodge has the authority and obligation to uphold these mandates and penalize any member who violates them.
[2:44:26.560 --> 2:44:31.560]  Masonic rules also warn members from inviting the vulgar and profane.
[2:44:31.560 --> 2:44:37.560]  The profane is what they call the uninitiated, anyone outside their secret order.
[2:44:37.560 --> 2:44:45.560]  As one climbs the ladder of power and Freemasonry, each degree requires more barbaric acts from the initiate.
[2:44:45.560 --> 2:44:52.560]  From being humiliated and stepped on, drinking wine from a human skull, stabbing human skulls.
[2:44:52.560 --> 2:45:01.560]  And in one of the highest degrees, the initiate removes a blindfold to find a severed human head lying on the floor with a bloody knife beside it.
[2:45:01.560 --> 2:45:06.560]  He is instructed to take the knife in his right hand and the head in his left.
[2:45:06.560 --> 2:45:16.560]  Eventually, this leads the initiate to accept human sacrifice as a right of initiation, which is the ultimate goal of this unholy hierarchy.
[2:45:16.560 --> 2:45:30.560]  33rd degree Mason, Manly P. Hall, who was named Freemason of the Century, wrote that Freemasonry is a religion and that initiates are intentionally misled until they reach the highest levels.
[2:45:30.560 --> 2:45:39.560]  He wrote that Freemasonry is an outer organization concealing an inner brotherhood, one visible and one invisible.
[2:45:39.560 --> 2:45:45.560]  The invisible is dedicated to the service of a mysterious arcaneum arcanorum.
[2:45:45.560 --> 2:45:56.560]  Having a belief in a supreme being is required to become a Mason, and the atheist is looked upon by the Mason as being the most vulgar and despicable of mankind.
[2:45:56.560 --> 2:45:59.560]  But who is the supreme being in Masonry?
[2:45:59.560 --> 2:46:03.560]  Freemasonry is Satanism in disguise.
[2:46:03.560 --> 2:46:13.560]  33rd degree Sovereign Grand Commander of the Scottish Right, Albert Pike, wrote in Morals and Dogma that Lucifer is the light bearer.
[2:46:13.560 --> 2:46:21.560]  33rd degree Mason, Albert Mackey, wrote that Lucifer is good, light, victory, and initiation.
[2:46:21.560 --> 2:46:33.560]  And 33rd degree Freemason of the Century, Manly P. Hall, wrote that the mystery of the craft is the seething, surging energies of Lucifer that can be wielded by the initiate.
[2:46:33.560 --> 2:46:41.560]  This is the symbol for Satanism, and this is the symbol for female Freemasonry, the Order of the Eastern Star.
[2:46:41.560 --> 2:46:50.560]  The Satanic Bible lists Bathomet as the symbol of Satan worshipped by the highest level of Freemasonry, the Templar Masons.
[2:46:50.560 --> 2:47:05.560]  In the Satanic rituals, it is written that Masonic orders contain the most influential men in government, and virtually every occult order has Masonic roots, and that every right of the Nazi's black order employed Masonic principles.
[2:47:05.560 --> 2:47:12.560]  Both Satanism and Masonic rituals involve the goat, the coffin, and the death's head.
[2:47:12.560 --> 2:47:19.560]  Anton Lavey wrote that the Masonic rituals serve as a screening process for organized Satanism.
[2:47:19.560 --> 2:47:29.560]  Freemasons can also be seen making the 666 hand gesture.
[2:47:29.560 --> 2:47:36.560]  I'm a Christian, sir. I'm pure and virtuous and wholesome and innocent. How can you say anything to buy it about me?
[2:47:36.560 --> 2:47:42.560]  Sir, you need to be born again. I am born again. Now, did you just say that you were Lucifer? I am Lucifer.
[2:47:42.560 --> 2:47:50.560]  Okay, define Lucifer for me. Pure, virtuous, wholesome, innocent individual that's ought to help people. Lucifer is? Yeah.
[2:47:50.560 --> 2:47:58.560]  Say that again. Lucifer is a pure, holy. Virtuous. Virtuous. Now, see the Lucifer that God created? That's the same one.
[2:47:58.560 --> 2:48:11.560]  At the highest level of the so-called Illuminati is a perverted sex cult, which is why high-level Mason Walt Disney not only saturated his films with Masonic hand gestures and 666,
[2:48:11.560 --> 2:48:16.560]  but also added subliminal images with hidden sexuality.
[2:48:16.560 --> 2:48:30.560]  Alteon claims that the square and compass are actually symbolizing the sex act. The woman's legs spread open and a man mounting her. The G symbolizes the generative principle of creation.
[2:48:30.560 --> 2:48:38.560]  The all-seeing eye symbolizes the head of the penis. And the ray shooting forth the orgasm.
[2:48:38.560 --> 2:48:50.560]  Each year, 13 high-level masons may be invited to join the top of this monstrous pyramid, the royal order of jesters, dedicated to nothing but sexual depravity.
[2:48:50.560 --> 2:49:03.560]  There is no sin. There is only nature. Why do you think that witchcraft has disappeared? It never disappeared. It was hidden.
[2:49:03.560 --> 2:49:11.560]  Forced to go into hiding by the appearance of Jesus on the human scene. Another reason why he's passionately hated.
[2:49:11.560 --> 2:49:20.560]  33rd degree Mason Aleister Crowley wrote how he pecks at the eyes of Jesus on the cross, how the new age will arise from the destruction of Christianity,
[2:49:20.560 --> 2:49:27.560]  and how all children shall be accustomed from infancy to witness every type of sexual act.
[2:49:27.560 --> 2:49:35.560]  According to the royal art of Freemasonry, magic is the highest and most divine. And what is this magic?
[2:49:35.560 --> 2:49:41.560]  Any living being is a storehouse of energy, varying in quantity, according to the size and health of the animal.
[2:49:41.560 --> 2:49:48.560]  At the depth of the animal, this energy is liberated suddenly. The animal therefore should be killed within the circle.
[2:49:48.560 --> 2:49:58.560]  For the highest spiritual working, one must, according to which, choose that victim which contains the greatest and purest force, a male child.
[2:49:58.560 --> 2:50:06.560]  We are witnessing the culmination of their mysterious arcaneum, the destruction of Christianity and the mass sacrifice of humanity.
[2:50:06.560 --> 2:50:14.560]  Created in 1979 by the Masonic Order of the Rose Cross, the first Luciferian commandment carved into the Georgia Guidestones
[2:50:14.560 --> 2:50:20.560]  and maintained humanity under 500 million in perpetual balance with nature.
[2:50:20.560 --> 2:50:30.560]  High-level Mason Friedrich Nietzsche wrote how Christianity is more harmful than any vice, and considered Christians sick animals.
[2:50:30.560 --> 2:50:43.560]  Their utopian new age, as written about in the Satanic Bible and in the Lucius Trust, consultants to the European Union, is nothing more than the absolute destruction of Christianity.
[2:50:43.560 --> 2:50:51.560]  Alistair Crowley wrote how the people need to be ruled by the state and the world must be bathed in blood to usher in the new age.
[2:50:51.560 --> 2:50:58.560]  Subversion of all governments and world religions has been going on in secrecy for centuries.
[2:50:58.560 --> 2:51:07.560]  Religious leaders, heads of state, and your favorite pop stars have practically all been absorbed into this hidden hand of Satanism.
[2:51:07.560 --> 2:51:16.560]  In 1991, the Nohide Laws were signed into U.S. law by Skolin Bones member George Bush.
[2:51:16.560 --> 2:51:25.560]  Once these laws are practiced openly, it will be blasphemy to call Jesus Christ your Lord and Savior, punishable by death.
[2:51:25.560 --> 2:51:29.560]  They want to bring us back to the days of blood sacrifice.
[2:51:29.560 --> 2:51:37.560]  Whether you believe or not, the culture of compassion, mercy, and love is Christian.
[2:51:37.560 --> 2:51:43.560]  Christ ended the days of blood sacrifice. Christ forgave us of our sins.

[2:54:01.560 --> 2:54:19.560]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide, it's Alex Jones. And now, your host, Matt Bracken.
[2:54:19.560 --> 2:54:34.560]  Well, here I am again. Every time that you see me on the Alex Jones show, it's a good sign, I guess, because we never know when we're going to be removed from communicating.
[2:54:34.560 --> 2:54:47.560]  That's going to be one of the real turning points in our country. While we can communicate, I would say we're still free, right? We're still free.
[2:54:47.560 --> 2:55:00.560]  Although, pretty soon, we're going to all be faced with the pressure to take this vaccine. And at that point, I would say we most absolutely certainly are not free.
[2:55:00.560 --> 2:55:16.560]  And already, a lot of us, I think, are not free just to the extent that this full court press of brainwashing has succeeded in stealing their human agency.
[2:55:16.560 --> 2:55:36.560]  I'm a boomer. You know, I was born at the end of the 50s. And I've seen a lot, but I have never seen anything in my life like the total wall-to-wall 24-7 brainwashing to take this vaccine.
[2:55:36.560 --> 2:55:49.560]  This untested emergency use authorized only experimental mRNA gene therapy. We literally are the human guinea pigs.
[2:55:49.560 --> 2:55:57.560]  We don't know how much research went into this before Operation Warp Speed.
[2:55:57.560 --> 2:56:14.560]  Did these big pharma companies that are one way or the other under the control of, you know, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the George Soros Open Society, these huge global monopolies,
[2:56:14.560 --> 2:56:31.560]  have they been just waiting to roll this out, waiting for a reason to incite, no pun intended, their own agenda into this pandemic?
[2:56:31.560 --> 2:56:45.560]  You know, I'm an admirer of Donald Trump, as many of us are. He at least was a fighter. But I think that when it comes to Operation Warp Speed and rolling out the vaccine,
[2:56:45.560 --> 2:57:11.560]  I think that he was also brainwashed and rolled. He was put into a position where he couldn't say no to this vaccine program. And as a result, we have what we have, which is potentially as bad as even a mass sterilization event.
[2:57:11.560 --> 2:57:27.560]  We really don't know. How can we tell? Right now, I can't even tell if my Skype connection is working. Have I lost the connection, folks?
[2:57:27.560 --> 2:57:43.560]  I might have to, okay, I'm told that I still have the connection. We don't know what's in this vaccine. You know, at the best, you could say, well, you know, Fauci and the other minions,
[2:57:43.560 --> 2:57:57.560]  they're going to be surprised just like all the rest of us when it turns out that this has some kind of a sterilizing effect for other consequences on children yet unborn.
[2:57:57.560 --> 2:58:13.560]  Diastrosilbestrol, which sterilized women, that was a drug used in the 50s, accepted FDA approved drug. In Britain, there was another one called Thalidomide, which resulted in horrible birth defects.
[2:58:13.560 --> 2:58:31.560]  So we might not know the effects of this vaccination program for years or even for decades for, you know, babies in the womb today might not know until they grow up and turn out to be sterile or worse birth defects.
[2:58:31.560 --> 2:58:39.560]  But it doesn't matter. We've just got to run with it, go full speed, take the injection.
[2:58:39.560 --> 2:58:51.560]  You turn on the television, whether it's local news, national news, it's either systemic racism or it's COVID vaccine. Take the vaccine.
[2:58:51.560 --> 2:59:11.560]  The slide now.
[2:59:11.560 --> 2:59:21.560]  If you're aware of the attack that's happening, we have a real chance of defeating it. If we ask God for guidance, we will defeat it.
[2:59:21.560 --> 2:59:27.560]  So prayer is essential, research is essential, getting prepared is essential, and warning others is absolutely essential.
[2:59:27.560 --> 2:59:41.560]  And at the same time, supporting InfoWars by buying high quality products to keep us on air is essential because they're great products for you and your family, and they're also funding our operation.
[2:59:41.560 --> 2:59:47.560]  InfoWarsStore.com. InfoWarsStore.com is incredible. A lot of our products that have been sold out because the supply chain breakdowns are back in like bodies, vasobites and others.
[2:59:47.560 --> 3:00:03.560]  So get them today at InfoWarsStore.com and I thank you for being part of the resistance.
[3:00:03.560 --> 3:00:17.560]  The answer to 1984 is 1776. It's Matt Bracken. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:00:17.560 --> 3:00:35.560]  I'm sorry for any little bad outro there. Kind of a few little Skype technical issues here. But this vaccine, if we're forced to take it, and by forced, I think Tucker's done a terrific job last night in the opening, as has been mentioned.
[3:00:35.560 --> 3:00:51.560]  If you have to take the vaccine to go back to school, if you have to take the vaccine to get on an airplane or to get on a cruise ship, if you have to take the vaccine in the military, an experimental vaccine.
[3:00:51.560 --> 3:01:07.560]  I remember back during the Kuwait Desert Storm era, troops were forced to take the anthrax vaccine and other vaccines, but at least they weren't experimental. They had in some way or another been approved.
[3:01:07.560 --> 3:01:21.560]  They had been out for, you know, for years or decades. This is something entirely new. And it's not even true to call it an actual vaccine, because it's not. It's something completely original.
[3:01:21.560 --> 3:01:39.560]  And I would urge anybody that has not seen it to please watch a documentary. It's two hours, but it's broken into four parts by a blogger named James Corbett, and it's called Who Is Bill Gates?
[3:01:39.560 --> 3:02:01.560]  And it goes into detail on the Gates family being three generations of eugenicists. This myth that Bill Gates was some computer whiz who dreamed up computer ideas in his garage and was sort of like Steve Jobs.
[3:02:01.560 --> 3:02:12.560]  He just came up with Microsoft, is completely bogus. This is all laid out in this documentary, Who Is Bill Gates?
[3:02:12.560 --> 3:02:22.560]  He was actually a guy who wasn't the computer genius at all, but he had a lot of family backing, a lot of family money, and legal backing.
[3:02:22.560 --> 3:02:34.560]  So in an era in the 1970s when computer code was virtually freeware, you know, code writers were sharing this stuff, open source.
[3:02:34.560 --> 3:02:45.560]  And he got his own legal teams using family money to give himself a monopoly on the initial code that he basically ripped off from other people.
[3:02:45.560 --> 3:02:54.560]  But once he patented it and got it copyrighted and under legal protection, that's when the whole Microsoft story began.
[3:02:54.560 --> 3:02:59.560]  It wasn't that Bill Gates was some, you know, genius code writer, not at all.
[3:02:59.560 --> 3:03:15.560]  And in effect, you could look at Bill Gates as using Microsoft to fund his true family passion, which is eugenics. He's Bill Gates the number three, the third.
[3:03:15.560 --> 3:03:27.560]  Going all the way back to the beginning of the 20th century, the Gates family has been involved in eugenics movements, primarily concerned with overpopulation.
[3:03:27.560 --> 3:03:37.560]  Microsoft has given him the money to be at the table during all of this, you know, the events of the last couple of decades.
[3:03:37.560 --> 3:03:47.560]  He's now one of probably the three most powerful people on earth, you know, forget politicians, they come and they go.
[3:03:47.560 --> 3:03:55.560]  People like Bill Gates buy and sell politicians, you know, like their, you know, sheep and goats at the market.
[3:03:55.560 --> 3:04:05.560]  The real power is in these people like Soros and Gates and others, the ones that control these global monopolies.
[3:04:05.560 --> 3:04:15.560]  When you strip it all down, even these big pharma companies, they're just little widgets in these giant global conglomerates.
[3:04:15.560 --> 3:04:19.560]  And this plan has been unfolding for years.
[3:04:19.560 --> 3:04:35.560]  I don't know if we'll be able to see it maybe in one of the next segments, but I just became aware today of a HBO miniseries that was filmed in 2019, but released in September of 2020.
[3:04:35.560 --> 3:04:38.560]  And it was called Utopia.
[3:04:38.560 --> 3:04:43.560]  It's not to be confused with a British version, which was released in 2013.
[3:04:43.560 --> 3:04:53.560]  But if you're looking for it, if you're searching for it on a video platform, look for Utopia 2020 starring Bill Cusack.
[3:04:53.560 --> 3:05:11.560]  And it's basically what we've been seeing, which is these global villains using a new pandemic as a pretext to roll out a vaccine, which in truth is a sterilization tool.
[3:05:11.560 --> 3:05:19.560]  Because they're convinced that overpopulation is the big threat to the world, and they're not going to kill anybody.
[3:05:19.560 --> 3:05:20.560]  That's the plan.
[3:05:20.560 --> 3:05:24.560]  They're not going to actually put out a poison that kills people.
[3:05:24.560 --> 3:05:28.560]  It's just going to sterilize three generations.
[3:05:28.560 --> 3:05:42.560]  And it's just extremely creepy that this film was produced just as they were doing their pandemic planning.
[3:05:42.560 --> 3:06:00.560]  I forget the name of it, Global 2021. This was all of these same big shots, you know, Gates Soros, Rockefellers, all of them meeting in New York talking about how they're going to manage this planet.
[3:06:00.560 --> 3:06:04.560]  That's when this film was produced and it was released in 2020.
[3:06:04.560 --> 3:06:22.560]  It was canceled after eight episodes because people found it just too creepy, extremely violent and just way too creepy that this film was talking about, you know, literally shoehorning a vaccine on the back of a fairly minor pandemic,
[3:06:22.560 --> 3:06:41.560]  but using all of their brainwashing tools, their global control of all TV networks, virtually every major media platform, control of governments, control of all of the messaging to whip up a hysteria about a pandemic,
[3:06:41.560 --> 3:07:04.560]  and then use it to ramrod a vaccine into people into the entire global population for the purpose of sterilizing three generations of humanity to bring the global population down from, you know, seven or more billion people to a more manageable billion and a half.
[3:07:04.560 --> 3:07:20.560]  Of course, these global elites, they'll still have their Gulfstream jets. They'll still be, you know, the masters of the world, but they just won't have to deal with the problems of feeding and managing seven billion, you know, humans.
[3:07:20.560 --> 3:07:36.560]  They're going to lower it down through sterilization and a slow die off. And if this doesn't sound like reality, I don't know what does, but I recommend watching the segment, the clip that's floating around.
[3:07:36.560 --> 3:07:51.560]  You know, talking about the, I guess, John Cusack is sort of a, I wouldn't say a necessarily a Bill Gates, but he's one of the vaccine designers and implementers. And this is where we are now.
[3:07:51.560 --> 3:08:11.560]  You know, the military itself is in a quandary about how far they can push this. Can they force soldiers to take the vaccine? But when it's an experimental vaccine until now, it's been illegal for the military to force soldiers to take any experimental vaccine.
[3:08:11.560 --> 3:08:21.560]  But that seems to be changing because these evil forces have complete control of all of the messaging. There's no counter message allowed.
[3:08:21.560 --> 3:08:47.560]  Websites that even obliquely talk about, you know, the vaccine not being a panacea are forced off of the Internet. There's a great website called life site news. It's been pushed off of Twitter, Facebook, just, you know, shunned into the outer reaches, because it has expressed even minor doubt about the vaccine.
[3:08:47.560 --> 3:09:01.560]  And I would like to, you know, I hope that Tucker Carlson can stay on the air. You know, for a major network, for a major network at Fox News, he seems to be pushing the envelope about as far as he can.
[3:09:01.560 --> 3:09:29.560]  The last night's opening was very risky for him, I think, because he's really poking this global leviathan. He's almost daring them to take him out one way or the other, because he is rehashing issues that have gotten, you know, people lower on the food scale, the media food scale, completely banished and banned.
[3:09:29.560 --> 3:09:49.560]  So I wonder what they're going to do to take out Tucker Carlson, because this is really going to be the Rubicon, the turning point, if they can force us to take the vaccine, freedom's dead. And that's just a fact.
[3:09:49.560 --> 3:10:04.560]  A hundred and seventy years ago, the British royal family financed scientists to develop a plan for scientific dictatorship worldwide. That grew into the robber barons, and then into the eugenics movement, Hitler, and of course, the rest is history.
[3:10:04.560 --> 3:10:16.560]  Our film, Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement, has been censored on Amazon and many other big platforms, sending the documentary film back to the top of the charts. It's been selling online for as much as $300 a copy.
[3:10:16.560 --> 3:10:36.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, I have mass produced it again in the highest quality HD. It is available after not being available for years at infowarstore.com.

[3:11:19.560 --> 3:11:27.560]  I'm going to wake up today. You know what? I'm going to spend my entire day trying to make that guy over there healthier, happier, and richer. I'm going to make sure he gets a Ferrari and a girlfriend.
[3:11:27.560 --> 3:11:34.560]  I don't think that happens very often. It's never happened to me. I've never had anyone knock on my door and said, Tate, you're such a good guy. How can I improve your life in every single way?
[3:11:34.560 --> 3:11:41.560]  There's only one person who woke up and thought, nah, and that was me. I woke up and thought, you know what? Okay, I want to take control of my life. I want to take control of my health.
[3:11:41.560 --> 3:12:04.560]  And that's why you need to go to infowarstore.com. Take control of your health right now and support the resistance. Don't buy into the group thing. Don't drink the Kool-Aid. Drink the Turbo Force. Kool-Aid's bad and the Turbo Force is good.
[3:12:12.560 --> 3:12:19.560]  Waging war on corruption. It's Alex Jones with Matt Bracken.
[3:12:19.560 --> 3:12:45.560]  If anybody doubts that normal American life is done, I think that we started getting the idea when things happened like Roger Stone being arrested and the pre-dawn raid with the CNN cameras rolling.
[3:12:45.560 --> 3:13:06.560]  But now with Rudy Giuliani being his house being raided, not arrested yet, but America's mayor, Rudy Giuliani, raided by the FBI for electronic devices that were freely offered as if he's a flight risk he's going to take off to Paraguay or somewhere.
[3:13:06.560 --> 3:13:15.560]  This is the FBI being fully turned into the Democrat Party Stasi. There is absolutely no question about this.
[3:13:15.560 --> 3:13:32.560]  And if we shy away from this topic, if we just pretend that everything is okay and we're just going to somehow come through in 22, the GOP is going to have a big victory, everything will be back to normal.
[3:13:32.560 --> 3:13:53.560]  I don't believe it. The Department of Justice, which has also been completely politicized and weaponized, even the FISA court, some of the bad actors from the Russia hoax, like Mary McCord, she's now working at the FISA court as a consultant.
[3:13:53.560 --> 3:14:04.560]  So this is literally putting the fox with the bloody teeth in charge of the hen house the next night after the big hen massacre.
[3:14:04.560 --> 3:14:26.560]  This is when the Democrats and the Department of Justice and the FBI just don't care anymore. They don't care that we know. It's like the Solzhenitsyn quote that the KGB or the Communist Party, they know that we know that it's all a lie.
[3:14:26.560 --> 3:14:41.560]  And we know that they know and it goes on like that. They just don't care because they feel that they're in total control. I think that people holding out hope for 2022 just vote harder next time.
[3:14:41.560 --> 3:14:52.560]  I mean, I certainly am going to vote. Don't get me wrong because I'm going to keep paddling until the canoe is completely submerged, right?
[3:14:52.560 --> 3:15:07.560]  But as far as I'm concerned, the evil forces in this country are fully and totally in control. This means that Alex could be arrested. I could be arrested.
[3:15:07.560 --> 3:15:19.560]  They just have to put a face on the wall and then say, go get them, team. Find the crime. And if you can't find the crime, plant something on his computer.
[3:15:19.560 --> 3:15:26.560]  They've already been doing this for years. Cheryl Ackerson has written a couple of excellent books about this.
[3:15:26.560 --> 3:15:43.560]  She had information planted on her computer, which the people doing this didn't understand that her hard drive, her computer tower, was right next to her bed because she was constantly up and down checking things.
[3:15:43.560 --> 3:16:03.560]  So when her hard drive would go into turbo spin mode for no reason for 20 minutes or half an hour at a time in the middle of the night, she took the tower into her own IT consultants, computer security people, ex-government people.
[3:16:03.560 --> 3:16:22.560]  And they found all of this classified information had been planted inside of her computer. No doubt to facilitate an arrest at a later date. This is your FBI today. They are no different than the KGB or the Stasi.
[3:16:22.560 --> 3:16:33.560]  And I know a lot of people are very shy about talking about this because they don't want to get the Roger Stone treatment or the Paul Manafort treatment.
[3:16:33.560 --> 3:16:55.560]  What surprised them was how brave Roger Stone was that he didn't just buckle and read the prepared script. If he had turned Judas against Donald Trump and read the script, they wanted him to read, he wouldn't have lost his house, he wouldn't have lost his livelihood, his life savings.
[3:16:55.560 --> 3:17:19.560]  They do this to break people. So I'm not sure what Roger is doing in terms of fundraising right now, but I have to make a note to revisit this because they've basically financially ruined the man to the point of absolute impoverishment.
[3:17:19.560 --> 3:17:32.560]  So if they can't put you in prison, they can almost put you on the street. This is your Department of Justice and your FBI today. And shame on them.
[3:17:32.560 --> 3:17:57.560]  If somehow constitutional minded people ever take control of this country again, maybe there will be a day of reckoning. But I seriously doubt it because the people who pulled the entire Russiagate scam, the FBI agents who had Hunter Biden's laptop and knew all the truth about Ukraine and
[3:17:57.560 --> 3:18:09.560]  Burisma and the Biden corruption, they had that right during the Donald Trump impeachment, the Ukraine impeachment, and they kept it hidden.
[3:18:09.560 --> 3:18:30.560]  They're as corrupt and dirty and evil as the worst corrupt old machine city police department ever, the Serpico era New York vice cops. They're just dripping with evil corruption.
[3:18:30.560 --> 3:18:40.560]  And a shame on them for wearing that badge, that gold FBI badge, which they'll sometimes flash as if it still means anything.
[3:18:40.560 --> 3:19:03.560]  A friend of mine knows somebody who's been visited by the FBI and they've now gotten so woke that the female agent had multicolored fingernails with the index fingers over an inch long. The male had tattoos on the backs of his hands and fingers.
[3:19:03.560 --> 3:19:20.560]  This tells me and nothing wrong with that folks, but we're talking about the FBI. All right, they've gone fully hard woke. They are completely captured now by the hard left.
[3:19:20.560 --> 3:19:46.560]  They're looking at us, you know, constitutional conservatives as their as their enemies of the state. And they feel totally emboldened to frame to perjure themselves to plant evidence to create evidence to solicit perjury by threatening people with hard jail time in order to get at their other victims.
[3:19:46.560 --> 3:19:57.560]  This is the very dangerous era that we're in now. And the next thing is going to be turning the military loose on Americans.
[3:19:57.560 --> 3:20:20.560]  I mean, no Posse Comitatus, who cares about that when you've turned the FBI into the KGB and Stasi. You really think they're going to care about turning the military against Americans now? I mean, right in the Constitution, it says that there to the military is to protect our country from invasion.
[3:20:20.560 --> 3:20:35.560]  While the executive branch opens the floodgates for an invasion and has buses running 24 hours a day, taking illegals into every American city in order to tip the electoral balance.
[3:20:35.560 --> 3:20:42.560]  So do you really think that they're going to have any qualms about turning the military loose against us?
[3:20:42.560 --> 3:20:50.560]  These are dark days, folks. I wish I wasn't sort of black-filled, but I am.
[3:20:50.560 --> 3:21:02.560]  You know, listeners call into the show when they thank me and it makes me feel pathetic because I sit there and I beg you for support constantly for prayer, for financial support, and for word of mouth.
[3:21:02.560 --> 3:21:16.560]  And we're all in this together. And you know, it gets old having to come to me and say, hey, I got great products, please, bomb, or we won't be here on air. But it's true. We're the only media organization in the United States that promotes liberty at this level that is not beholden to big corporate sponsors.
[3:21:16.560 --> 3:21:25.560]  And they've harassed and almost shut down everybody else. They crippled all the other groups. And we're still here. And as this whole new world order comes out in the open, our credibility is going up.
[3:21:25.560 --> 3:21:33.560]  That's why we've got to be taken off air. That's why America has got to be taken down. You can't have all these other nations enslaved. And America's still quasi-free.
[3:21:33.560 --> 3:21:40.560]  You can't have info wars that's been proven right, being on air, with all the craziness that's about to unfold. Because if you think stuff's bad now, just get ready.
[3:21:40.560 --> 3:21:49.560]  So thank you all. And get an infowarstore.com. Get some great 2020 election shirts, supplements, and so much more. They're wonderful products. And they support the info. Thank you.
[3:21:49.560 --> 3:22:04.560]  All of the experts agree that getting proper sleep is the cornerstone of good health. It has been proven that a poor sleep schedule is linked with numerous health problems, including weight gain, memory issues, mood changes, poor concentration, and even a weakened immune system.
[3:22:04.560 --> 3:22:19.560]  Introducing Rocket Rest, the new product from our Dr. Jones Naturals line at infowarstore.com. The new Rocket Rest formula is loaded with the best natural ingredients to help not only improve your quality of sleep, but help you wake up feeling refreshed.
[3:22:19.560 --> 3:22:37.560]  Many competitor sleep formulas focus only on getting you to sleep, but Rocket Rest was specifically formulated to help you feel rested and ready to take on the next day. It uses a unique quick release capsule system to ensure fast delivery of deep sleep support ingredients like melatonin and magnesium.

[3:22:49.560 --> 3:23:05.560]  Listeners have rightfully been complaining the last six months or so saying, where are most of the best selling products you have that we love? And my answer is the supply chain has broken down. I have to either reformulate or I have to lower the quality to get a lot of these.
[3:23:05.560 --> 3:23:20.560]  So that's why we don't have a lot of products in. That's why Info Wars is in financial trouble is because if we had the product, you would be buying it, we'd have the money. But so many of them have been sold out. Just like you noticed, a lot of other items at the store aren't available because civilization is being artificially imploded.
[3:23:20.560 --> 3:23:43.560]  But finally, X2 is back in stock, the good halogen, deep-worth crystal iodide, so essential in your body. It's really the missing link. It's 50% off. We've got a big shipment of it at infowarstore.com. Now when it gets ready to sell out, we'll have to go back to near full price, take advantage of this now, stock up, and don't forget to take your X2 because I have a tendency to forget how great it is and not take it myself.
[3:23:43.560 --> 3:23:49.560]  But when I do, stamina, libido, energy, weight loss, it's incredible. It's essential. It's X2 at infowarstore.com.
[3:23:49.560 --> 3:24:08.560]  14 months ago, I began to see on the broadcast every day when the first world collapses, the third world dies. We have such a complex civilization with so many billions of moving parts that when you shut down the first world, it causes a chain reaction that will devastate the third world and really hurt the first world.
[3:24:08.560 --> 3:24:21.560]  Well, now you're hearing about gas shortages all over the United States. That's because the companies and the systems and the drivers that could barely get the job done before delivering gas had been shut down. Plus, the Keystone pipeline's been shut down along with other pipelines.
[3:24:21.560 --> 3:24:33.560]  The left is now blowing up dams across the U.S. We're being shut down. Our coal power plants are off as well. Ladies and gentlemen, prepare to be a total slave. The third world is imploding as well. The borders have been removed.
[3:24:33.560 --> 3:24:43.560]  Until you wake up, and this is a globalist chai-com takeover, Gregory said, you have no hope. They're announcing that there will be less than two-thirds the gas needed this summer.
[3:24:43.560 --> 3:25:04.560]  So they told you that you're under lockdown one way or another and CNN laughed at you and your family.
[3:25:13.560 --> 3:25:33.560]  You know, I don't know how Alex does it. It is really gut-wrenching for me to do this, and I can't even imagine doing this for a couple hours every day, as well as all of the off-air show prep and running a business.
[3:25:33.560 --> 3:25:55.560]  I can't even imagine, because this just pulls it out of me. I don't like talking about these things. I wish that I wasn't. I wish I could be off somewhere writing genre fiction, silly stuff about detectives and spies and the mafia.
[3:25:55.560 --> 3:26:06.560]  But I can't, because now we're actually in it. We are in the game, not the game. We're really in a death struggle for our freedom.
[3:26:06.560 --> 3:26:26.560]  Because the people that are running this operation, they have no intention of backing down. They think that they now own the entire, they own the bank, the factory, the candy store, they own the supermarket, they own everything, and there's nothing we can do about it.
[3:26:26.560 --> 3:26:50.560]  You know, this vaccine is just one more massive power grab. Can we literally brainwash enough of the people into accepting this gene therapy so that the rest, the resistors, the holdouts will feel so much pressure that they'll take it as well?
[3:26:50.560 --> 3:27:13.560]  And that's even before you bring up the issue of shedding. Like these Monsanto, Franklin food GMO genes that are blowing in the dust and being carried by birds and rodents into fields that were never using these Franklin gene.
[3:27:13.560 --> 3:27:27.560]  And, you know, the Franklin food Monsanto stuff. I'm sorry, I'm just, but what are we going to do if we're just backed into the corner?
[3:27:27.560 --> 3:27:46.560]  You know, I think that, and it's a theme of mine, not everything in this country is going to happen in the same way, you know, from state to state and city to city. There's going to be very different outcomes.
[3:27:46.560 --> 3:28:10.560]  If you compare, for example, Florida and Michigan, you have a governor of Michigan putting, you know, two year olds onto mandatory mask outside lockdown, no schools saying that unless the people will get to a certain percentage of vaccine acceptance,
[3:28:10.560 --> 3:28:30.560]  she won't open businesses. You know, she's literally got a scale. Governor Whitmer, she has like a time scale based on vaccination acceptance that she's essentially holding a gun to the heads of people saying you take the vaccine or we just keep the economy locked down.
[3:28:30.560 --> 3:28:51.560]  Meanwhile, she herself flew to Florida on a private Gulf Stream jet, you know, that she asked, quote unquote, air quotes, asked these corporate bosses if she could, you know, use one of their fractional ownership Gulf Streams to make a little side trip to Florida
[3:28:51.560 --> 3:29:09.560]  while she's lying about never leaving the state. This is the kind of ruler that the worst states are going to have. Meanwhile, I'm in, I'm in Florida, and my governor Ron DeSantis at least is trying as much as is humanly possible.
[3:29:09.560 --> 3:29:25.560]  You know, they're passing laws saying that there can be no mandatory vaccination, not at colleges, not by businesses. But we'll see how far that goes because, you know, Florida is also a big home for the cruise ship industry.
[3:29:25.560 --> 3:29:39.560]  The cruise lines are saying no vaccination, you know, no boarding the ship. Well, you can say a cruise ship that's completely voluntary, it's just a vacation, so don't go on the cruise ship and I get it.
[3:29:39.560 --> 3:29:52.560]  But it's another issue of can the governor of Florida really control these things or will the next step be a private college saying if you don't take the vaccination your kid can't come back to school.
[3:29:52.560 --> 3:30:04.560]  There's a real push and pull going on. But at least in Florida, the governor and the legislature is trying to push back against these forces of totalitarianism.
[3:30:04.560 --> 3:30:11.560]  You know, he's also going against big tech and social media for banning conservatives.
[3:30:11.560 --> 3:30:23.560]  So the only really hopeful, helpful advice I can give is to get away from the areas that are predictably going to be the worst.
[3:30:23.560 --> 3:30:41.560]  It's like a volcano zone when you live on the slope of Vesuvius and it starts to rumble. Well, why don't you move? Because it's going to get really bad, but it's going to be much worse in some areas than in some other areas.
[3:30:41.560 --> 3:30:52.560]  Now the real estate market in the states where people are moving is going kind of crazy. So you're going to have a hard time finding a house or an apartment. I understand that.
[3:30:52.560 --> 3:31:07.560]  Here in Florida, houses are going on the market and in an hour they're getting offers, you know, 10 and 15% over the asking price, over the asking price.
[3:31:07.560 --> 3:31:18.560]  People are showing up with cash in suitcases to buy houses. People are buying houses even over the internet without even visiting.
[3:31:18.560 --> 3:31:30.560]  This is showing you this osmotic pressure that the people in the Marxist oriented dictator states are getting out.
[3:31:30.560 --> 3:31:43.560]  Don't be left behind. This is sort of like the end of the Second World War when Germany and Eastern Europe were on their backs with occupying forces.
[3:31:43.560 --> 3:32:01.560]  Soviets in the East, Americans and British in the West, but there was still time for people to get a wagon and leave, you know, put their family, pick up the bundles, get anything that has wheels and drag it west.
[3:32:01.560 --> 3:32:23.560]  The iron curtain didn't go up the day after VE Day. It did not. There were still months and even in some cases years for people who could read the tea leaves to get the hell out of what was going to become communist iron curtain countries.
[3:32:23.560 --> 3:32:36.560]  And a lot of their neighbors probably just said, oh, the Soviets, they're not going to do that. They're probably going to go back to Russia or, you know, I was a socialist in college and the socialists are okay.
[3:32:36.560 --> 3:32:44.560]  So what's the problem? The people that could read the tea leaves said no, get out.
[3:32:44.560 --> 3:32:56.560]  A lot of the Jews in Germany in the 1930s, they were reading the tea leaves and they said, get out. You just don't wait for Hitler to be voted out.
[3:32:56.560 --> 3:33:02.560]  He's not going to be voted out. The military is not going to get rid of Hitler.
[3:33:02.560 --> 3:33:15.560]  The smart people in Germany that saw what was happening, they told their families, we're leaving. We're walking away. In many cases, they didn't even pack because they didn't want to alert their neighbors.
[3:33:15.560 --> 3:33:26.560]  They just left. And this is the kind of a shakeup that's going to go on in the United States because there's no way as much as they tried.
[3:33:26.560 --> 3:33:34.560]  I don't know if it's now they're saying it's Ron Klain is Biden's brain. So whenever I say Biden, I really mean Biden's handlers.
[3:33:34.560 --> 3:33:44.560]  There's no way that Biden's handlers can institute these draconian measures equally across all 50 states.
[3:33:44.560 --> 3:33:53.560]  But they are planning it. They are purging the military. They've already purged the CIA and Department of Justice.
[3:33:53.560 --> 3:33:59.560]  They've already got them running as little Marxist organizations.
[3:33:59.560 --> 3:34:13.560]  But the rest of the government and the military is engaged in this purge now where white conservative men are the absolute in this scenario.
[3:34:13.560 --> 3:34:27.560]  The Kulaks or the landlords in a Russian or Chinese context or the German Jews in the Nazi context, they are purging them out of the military.
[3:34:27.560 --> 3:34:38.560]  What do you think they're going to use the military for once it's fully purged and the only people left are the woke cultural Marxists?
[3:34:38.560 --> 3:34:47.560]  Do you think they're going to stick to the Constitution? Do you think they care about the Constitution? Not at all. Not a bit.
[3:34:47.560 --> 3:35:12.560]  We'll finish this in the next segment. I think the last section.

[3:37:42.560 --> 3:37:57.560]  The federal government commissioned secret radiation experiments on thousands of non-consenting patients.
[3:37:57.560 --> 3:38:10.560]  Hundreds of hospitals in the U.S. injected healthy men, women and children with uranium and plutonium at dosage levels ranging from non-therapeutic to lethal, killing many of the test subjects.
[3:38:10.560 --> 3:38:14.560]  Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement is one of the most important films ever made.
[3:38:14.560 --> 3:38:21.560]  Fourteen years ago, we tracked and documented the Bilderberg group's activities and their plans for a great reset using the threat of a fake virus.
[3:38:21.560 --> 3:38:26.560]  The film now is more important than ever. When it's shot to number one on Amazon last year, they banned it.
[3:38:26.560 --> 3:38:33.560]  We have it back in print available now at infowarstore.com, selling them as low as $3.95 a piece when you buy them in bulk.

[3:39:09.560 --> 3:39:31.560]  Well, you've got your diamonds and you've got your pretty clothes and the chauffeur drives your car. You let everybody know, but don't play with me because you're playing with my...
[3:39:31.560 --> 3:39:45.560]  If you buy my printed books, you don't have to get them from Bezos. You can get them from me if you look at my website, enemiesfarnanddomestic.com.
[3:39:45.560 --> 3:39:54.560]  The reason I wrote them was so that when the timing became really critical, like right now, I might have some kind of an input.
[3:39:54.560 --> 3:40:10.560]  So to that extent, my books have succeeded because here I am very grateful to Alex Jones and the InfoWars team for giving me this chance to continue my prognosticating.
[3:40:10.560 --> 3:40:27.560]  Now, this mandatory vaccine, whether it's the government mandating it or private industry mandating it, it really means the same thing because we're now into an era of corporate tyranny or corporatism.
[3:40:27.560 --> 3:40:45.560]  Where does the government end? And Google, Alphabet, YouTube, Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, where they begin? We've already seen senior people from Google going to work in the White House, for example.
[3:40:45.560 --> 3:41:02.560]  So it's really meaningless to say, well, you know, they're a private company and they can do what they like. They can ban the former president of the United States from posting on Twitter because they're a private company, but they're working hand in glove with the government.
[3:41:02.560 --> 3:41:19.560]  This is another definition of fascism, except under fascism, the government is controlling the industry. In this case, the power might have shifted so dramatically that the industry is now controlling the government.
[3:41:19.560 --> 3:41:39.560]  I mean, nobody that I know believes that Joe Biden got 80 million votes, right? This whole mass of chicanery was pulled off with huge help from the big tech, the global corporate big tech.
[3:41:39.560 --> 3:41:53.560]  They didn't want Trump. He's not a globalist and that's enough to set the dogs against him. The Department of Justice weaponized with, you know, two fake impeachments plus the Russia hoax.
[3:41:53.560 --> 3:42:09.560]  You know, this is a full machine now. It's not just the government or over there private industry and sometimes they're collaborating. No, they are all part of the same Leviathan.
[3:42:09.560 --> 3:42:26.560]  And sometimes I've struggled for a way to understand this. How can a small global elite, no matter how rich and powerful, how can they control this entire world, the entire population?
[3:42:26.560 --> 3:42:41.560]  And I just before the show and I just made like a little graphic to understand this. I look at this like a pyramid. Okay. And at the top are pure satanic forces.
[3:42:41.560 --> 3:43:01.560]  These are, you know, these you can understand in religious terms as, you know, Lucifer, pure evil, people that just want to see suffering. They'll make it literally make a deal with the devil to keep their, their own Gulfstream jets and private islands.
[3:43:01.560 --> 3:43:12.560]  But more than their own personal greed and lust for power, they, they're like arsonists. They're sociopaths. They want to see the world burn.
[3:43:12.560 --> 3:43:24.560]  And they're at the very pinnacle and generally unseen. But below them, and so I just made this little, I made this little, it's not working too good here.
[3:43:24.560 --> 3:43:42.560]  But below them on the pyramid, you have dedicated knowing, winning communist traders. They hate America because America is a sovereign, powerful superpower doing more good than bad in the world, I would say.
[3:43:42.560 --> 3:43:55.560]  And after World War Two, we could have just picked up where Great Britain left off. We didn't want to make out and out colonies. Japan had had and still has American troops there.
[3:43:55.560 --> 3:44:05.560]  But they're not goose stepping around, you know, ordering people what to do. Same thing in Germany. We've had a pretty light hand as far as empires go.
[3:44:05.560 --> 3:44:15.560]  But this is not enough for the dedicated, you know, the winning, knowing communists. I would certainly put John Brennan in that list.
[3:44:15.560 --> 3:44:23.560]  I would certainly put the new director of the CIA in that list. He is a stooge of the CCP.
[3:44:23.560 --> 3:44:35.560]  Now, you could almost say that there has been a takeover, that it's gone beyond just that we have leaders who are winning communists, you know, hiding in plain sight.
[3:44:35.560 --> 3:44:45.560]  Of course, they're not going to put the hammer and sickle lapel pin on yet. They're not going to run the hammer and sickle up over the White House yet.
[3:44:45.560 --> 3:45:07.560]  So they're still speaking in code, but it's clear. How does a guy who voted for, you know, the Communist Party during the Cold War, when the gulags were running full blast in the Soviet Union during the Cultural Revolution in China, when millions were being, you know, were being murdered?
[3:45:07.560 --> 3:45:19.560]  How does a guy like that not only get into the CIA, but rise to the very top of the CIA? Well, I'll tell you, it's with a lot of help.
[3:45:19.560 --> 3:45:34.560]  At the top of the pyramid, the satanic forces, they use their power, their evil satanic power to leverage the most useful tools to the top of the pyramid.
[3:45:34.560 --> 3:45:49.560]  This is how you get a Barack Obama, who to me is like a living embodiment of a Rosemary's baby or a Damien from the Omen series, you know, literally the spawn of Satan.
[3:45:49.560 --> 3:46:01.560]  How does he, this mystery man, slide through the elite colleges purportedly, and the next thing, you know, he's a senator, the next thing, you know, he's a president.
[3:46:01.560 --> 3:46:18.560]  It's with help from the satanic forces at the top. Now, just below on the pyramid, below the knowing Communist traders, you know, the John Brennan's, you have cultural Marxists.
[3:46:18.560 --> 3:46:33.560]  They're woke, they're leftist, they believe, you know, the BF, the brainwashing, they're fully brainwashed, they do believe there are 57 genders, and if tomorrow you say there's 72, they'll believe that.
[3:46:33.560 --> 3:46:41.560]  And if you say it's actually, you know, six genders, they'll believe that because they'll believe anything they're told.
[3:46:41.560 --> 3:46:56.560]  They're cultural Marxists, they're automatons, they don't do their own thinking. But they know that what they've been told in school from grade school on, that America is an evil empire, you know, based on racism and slavery.
[3:46:56.560 --> 3:47:07.560]  That's all it is, and it has to be destroyed. They're first level thinkers. That's the extent of their understanding. They're just brainwashed people that do as they're told.
[3:47:07.560 --> 3:47:19.560]  And below them, you just have apathetic, you know, useful idiots, just sheeple people that just want to watch TV and entertain themselves.
[3:47:19.560 --> 3:47:34.560]  It's a stretch to even call them first level thinkers. They're just reactive, just like, you know, like an animal just moving around the farm, not even knowing why the gates open and close.
[3:47:34.560 --> 3:47:39.560]  Not even knowing why the food appears sometimes and doesn't appear other times.
[3:47:39.560 --> 3:47:47.560]  And at the very bottom of the pyramid, unfortunately, this terrible, this blue screen, is us, the normal people.
[3:47:47.560 --> 3:47:59.560]  So we're most of the population, but we're being controlled by levers of power, tiny, tiny, but powerful forces at the very top, the Satanic forces,
[3:47:59.560 --> 3:48:17.560]  who open the doors for the knowing-witting communists who have a life mission of destroying the United States of America in order to usher in Communism 2.0, which in their version is globalism.
[3:48:17.560 --> 3:48:27.560]  And they use the brainwashing process to brainwash the easily duped cultural Marxists and useful idiots.
[3:48:27.560 --> 3:48:33.560]  And what do we do about it? How do you resist this when so much is stacked on top of us?
[3:48:33.560 --> 3:48:42.560]  Well, the power is stacked on top of us, but at the very least, you don't go along with it.
[3:48:42.560 --> 3:48:50.560]  You know, you fight back. When people say there's, you know, that gender is just a construct, call them idiots.
[3:48:50.560 --> 3:48:59.560]  Say, no, there are two sexes, two genders, that's it. Then there's gender dysphoria, but it doesn't count.
[3:48:59.560 --> 3:49:06.560]  If somebody says they're Napoleon, you don't have to go along with their fantasy.
[3:49:06.560 --> 3:49:12.560]  You just say, I'm sorry, you have a mental problem. The key is to push back.
[3:49:12.560 --> 3:49:18.560]  Don't just quietly go along hoping that this ship is going to ride itself.
[3:49:18.560 --> 3:49:23.560]  That's like the Poseidon adventure when the ship is at 90 degrees and going down.
[3:49:23.560 --> 3:49:34.560]  No, you can't wait for it to ride itself. You have to come out with a new strategy to escape from the ship because this ship is not going to ride itself.
[3:49:34.560 --> 3:49:49.560]  And it's going to be up to all of us to survive as best we can.
