[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does
[00:12.000 --> 00:40.000]  he. He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network. And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:40.000 --> 00:48.640]  Ladies and gentlemen, the son of Watergate, chillin' like a villain, Barack Hussein Obama
[00:48.640 --> 00:55.520]  is melting down, as I said, we were seeing last week. And yes, he's a globalist puppet,
[00:55.520 --> 01:04.640]  but all the hopes and dreams to sell tyranny and to sell war and torture and secret spying and
[01:04.640 --> 01:12.480]  political persecution as trendy is now falling on its face. When you see the establishment turn
[01:12.480 --> 01:18.640]  against somebody, it's because they realize he can't sell their agenda anymore and they're losing
[01:18.640 --> 01:26.080]  massive credibility because of him. But all I could say is too late. You're not gonna put a
[01:26.080 --> 01:31.840]  Republican puppet in there either and have us go back to sleep. That's why, despite the mainstream
[01:31.840 --> 01:39.840]  media demonizing him, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, people like that are so incredibly popular now across
[01:39.840 --> 01:47.600]  the political spectrum is because people want constitutionalists. They want people that support
[01:47.600 --> 01:54.000]  the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, due process. People hunger for checks and balances.
[01:54.000 --> 02:02.080]  And the fact that now it's come out in AP, Reuters, Washington Post, what we told you
[02:02.080 --> 02:08.320]  years ago, it came out years ago, that they were targeting and auditing and harassing Tea Party
[02:08.320 --> 02:14.400]  people. We have an article up on infoatwars.com dealing with that, how it was a conspiracy leak
[02:14.400 --> 02:20.080]  documents, IRS targeting conservatives in what media called conspiracy. And we have links to
[02:20.080 --> 02:26.320]  our articles and other articles from three years ago and two years ago, saying exactly what is now
[02:26.320 --> 02:33.200]  being reported. In fact, they're now linking in the media to older articles where it actually
[02:33.200 --> 02:43.680]  been mentioned. It's kind of like Fast and Furious. Where Big Sis and Holder and all these people at
[02:43.680 --> 02:52.400]  the Criminal Injustice Department, they, if you remember, came out like six months into office
[02:52.400 --> 02:56.400]  and said, we need to get the guns, there's a crowd in Mexico, and we've got an Operation Gunrunner
[02:56.400 --> 03:00.160]  tracking the guns. And then later they're like, we've never heard of Gunrunner, we've never heard
[03:00.160 --> 03:05.040]  of Fast and Furious, why? It's not true, we didn't know, we didn't mean. And then of course,
[03:05.040 --> 03:08.160]  the memos came out, they were planning to use it to blame the Second Amendment.
[03:08.160 --> 03:15.040]  This stuff is all hiding in plain view. So why now is everybody from Jon Stewart
[03:16.400 --> 03:24.080]  to John McCain, all these establishment people, why are they now turning on the precious,
[03:24.080 --> 03:29.680]  darling little Obama? Because they wanna blame the failure in Syria on him,
[03:30.720 --> 03:36.160]  they wanna blame the failure to get Obamacare properly implemented on him.
[03:36.160 --> 03:40.240]  It was never designed to be implemented, it's designed to rob people and make Berkshire Hathaway
[03:40.240 --> 03:47.200]  stock increase in value cuz it makes you buy insurance from them. Their whole system is really
[03:47.200 --> 03:55.600]  waking people up, so they hope that they can just destroy Obama now, if not actually indict him in
[03:55.600 --> 04:03.040]  the House, convict him in the Senate, impeachment. They're hoping that if they destroy him politically,
[04:03.040 --> 04:10.240]  that will satisfy people like throwing someone into the mob to be torn apart or throwing someone
[04:10.240 --> 04:14.800]  to the wolves that are tracking you through the woods, giving the dog a bone.
[04:16.240 --> 04:21.520]  Now let's be clear here, I am very excited about Obama being brought to justice. I'm very excited,
[04:21.520 --> 04:27.200]  I'd like to see them all go to jail. And I think it's important to punish corrupt politicians. But
[04:27.200 --> 04:33.840]  I don't wanna settle with the Republicans who are scared of too deep an investigation,
[04:35.440 --> 04:37.280]  breaking through compartments into their corruption.
[04:38.880 --> 04:43.840]  I'm concerned they'll try to just make Hillary step down in some type of public censure
[04:43.840 --> 04:51.440]  of Obama. We need more than that, and we can crowbar into this space and bust the New World
[04:51.440 --> 04:57.280]  Order wide open. If we seize on something like this, it could be their Waterloo.
[05:21.440 --> 05:26.080]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone. You might not be able to control mother nature,
[05:26.080 --> 05:31.360]  but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply

[08:16.480 --> 08:24.240]  Big Brother. Mainstream media. Government cover-ups. You want answers? Well, so does he.
[08:24.240 --> 08:28.000]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[08:32.400 --> 08:40.720]  Coming to you live from the InfoWars News Center in Austin, Texas, radiating out across the entire
[08:40.720 --> 08:50.800]  globe. It is Tuesday, the 14th day of May 2013, and we're going to be live here, Lord willing,
[08:50.800 --> 08:57.120]  for the next three hours. Okay, ladies and gentlemen, here's what I want to do.
[08:58.080 --> 09:01.680]  I'm going to really try to control myself, but you know I won't. I'm going to try to hit
[09:01.680 --> 09:09.200]  the unraveling of the Obama administration, the Bozo administration, drunk on power,
[09:09.200 --> 09:14.400]  as Senator Rand Paul has said. You can watch that video up at rudgereport.com. They have a link to
[09:14.400 --> 09:18.880]  it right there in the middle column. We're going to be playing some of that audio for radio listeners
[09:18.880 --> 09:26.400]  here in the next segment. But I want to give the phone number out today, specifically,
[09:27.600 --> 09:31.680]  again, for first-time callers. That means real first-time callers that have never had a chance
[09:31.680 --> 09:37.440]  to get through to give us your take on why you think the bottom is falling out on Obama,
[09:38.560 --> 09:43.600]  why you think the establishment is turning against him, and how far you think this will go.
[09:43.600 --> 09:51.520]  I think most of it, in fact, I know most of that, depends on what we politically do. And it is very
[09:51.520 --> 10:00.560]  healthy. It shows that these people are not above the law. It is what is constitutional that Obama
[10:00.560 --> 10:07.600]  be indicted in the House and convicted in the Senate. And quite frankly, he shouldn't sail off
[10:07.600 --> 10:12.880]  in the sunset like Nixon, who said, I'm not a crook. I don't know anything about water,
[10:12.880 --> 10:18.480]  about Watergate, the hotel, the break-in. And, well, now we're seeing the same thing out of
[10:18.480 --> 10:24.160]  Obama. I didn't know about Benghazi. I didn't know about the IRS spying on people and harassing them.
[10:24.160 --> 10:29.920]  I didn't know about the AP and other media being spied on. You didn't know? It's on record that
[10:29.920 --> 10:37.440]  Obama has had, I've seen numbers of 15 times, 20 times, no one knows, the prosecution of
[10:37.440 --> 10:44.480]  whistleblowers at the federal level for reporting on corruption to the media. There are scores of
[10:44.480 --> 10:49.120]  people serving prison sentences. We've had corrupt presidents before, we've had a corrupt
[10:49.120 --> 10:55.680]  establishment, but we've never had a persecution of the lap dog media like we're now seeing.
[10:57.440 --> 11:02.640]  And so there's a lot of things happening, but I think the over the topness of the corruption of
[11:02.640 --> 11:09.840]  the reporters having to submit their questions before press conferences,
[11:09.840 --> 11:14.960]  not just for presidential press conferences, but for federal press conferences across the board.
[11:14.960 --> 11:20.480]  The scripting of everything, the fraud, the arrogance, the White House saying,
[11:20.480 --> 11:26.080]  we may just stop having press conferences and we'll maybe have a hologram president
[11:26.080 --> 11:36.640]  literally come out and make announcements. They have been caught across the board lying,
[11:36.640 --> 11:42.320]  and they've lost the people's confidence. Now, if Obama just gets a political spanking,
[11:42.320 --> 11:45.600]  and this becomes a political diversion, it's a big loss for liberty.
[11:45.600 --> 11:59.840]  But you can smell that kind of visceral electric ozone stench of fear and running,
[12:00.800 --> 12:06.880]  trampling from the establishment. They are scared across the board because globally,
[12:06.880 --> 12:13.040]  the currencies are melting down. We've been in a depression for five years in most sectors of
[12:13.040 --> 12:22.000]  the economy. By every old fashioned benchmark, they're cooking the modern numbers. Government is
[12:22.560 --> 12:28.880]  giving itself red carpet treatment, a million dollars a day for Obama to go on vacation,
[12:28.880 --> 12:32.720]  half a million a day for Biden. But it's not just here in the US,
[12:32.720 --> 12:36.160]  people are angry about this in England. They're angry about it all over the UK,
[12:36.160 --> 12:39.920]  they're angry about it in Israel. They're angry about it in Europe,
[12:39.920 --> 12:46.400]  they're angry about it in Russia. People are sick of it, and they now see through the fancy ties,
[12:47.040 --> 12:55.120]  and the sports jackets, and the Air Force Ones, and the Hollywoodization of everything.
[12:55.120 --> 13:05.280]  People are really getting nauseous from the intoxication of lies, and they're ready to hug
[13:05.280 --> 13:11.120]  the toilet and get the poison out of them. Now, the question is, will we be able to get to that
[13:11.120 --> 13:17.200]  point? I certainly hope so. So let me do this, let me go over the headlines here. Then I'm gonna
[13:17.200 --> 13:20.960]  give the phone number out, and I really do wanna take calls this hour and the next hour.
[13:20.960 --> 13:26.880]  And then we're gonna have top researcher on Monsanto and GMO to cover that big fight,
[13:26.880 --> 13:30.240]  Jeffrey Smith, covering some of the Supreme Court rulings and things that have been coming down the
[13:30.240 --> 13:34.880]  last few days, and the march on Monsanto nationwide coming up. We're gonna have him pop in for about
[13:34.880 --> 13:43.360]  30, 40 minutes at the start of the third hour. We've also got Dr. Kermit Gosnell found guilty
[13:43.360 --> 13:47.760]  of murdering infants in late term abortions. We're gonna be giving you the details on those counts.
[13:49.520 --> 13:54.880]  And they said what pushed the jury over the edge was the filthiness of the grimy clinic.
[13:56.320 --> 14:01.040]  That's a quote, the filthy grimy clinic. So it would have been okay if it was all glistening
[14:01.040 --> 14:07.280]  white and clean. And if he hadn't made jokes about babies and killing them and how much he enjoyed
[14:07.280 --> 14:11.040]  it, there wouldn't have been all the witnesses about them, babies swimming in toilets.
[14:12.160 --> 14:17.680]  If he would have done it in a professional manner, it's like, we torture, but it's
[14:17.680 --> 14:23.520]  professional. We spy on you, but it's done by professionals. Always notice they go,
[14:23.520 --> 14:28.000]  it's very professional at Abu Ghraib raping the children in front of their parents.
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.560]  It's very professional. I've said if Hitler wore a pink uniform,
[14:33.520 --> 14:37.120]  we probably never would have, even when he declared war on us, fought back.
[14:39.120 --> 14:45.360]  As long as you act non-threatening like Google and Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffett and all
[14:45.360 --> 14:54.560]  these crooks, they are crooks. Getting $44 billion of bailout money after you give political money
[14:54.560 --> 14:59.120]  to people that make the decision at the Treasury to then give 44 billion to you,
[14:59.120 --> 15:05.200]  hundreds of billions now, that's criminal. Google breaking into everybody's computers,
[15:05.200 --> 15:10.400]  hacking past with government back doors they were given, to steal your passcodes and everything,
[15:10.400 --> 15:15.840]  and spying on you. They've been convicted of that, but were given a slap on the wrist.
[15:15.840 --> 15:22.960]  That's criminal. But see, in the old days, people liked somebody dressed up in a black uniform,
[15:22.960 --> 15:29.360]  acting tough. That was seen as a strong leader. So people like Hitler and Mao and Stalin would
[15:29.360 --> 15:35.600]  stomp around and say, I'm coming to kill you. And that would kind of scare and awe their minions,
[15:36.400 --> 15:40.800]  because they would see projected power through the leader. But nowadays they're more sophisticated.
[15:40.800 --> 15:46.800]  They walk around with a metrosexual lisp and all of this, that's a complete cover,
[15:46.800 --> 15:53.040]  ladies and gentlemen. Because they can get everything as long as they go, I'm liberal,
[15:53.040 --> 15:57.920]  I'm a Peace Prize winner. We have video up on infowars.com
[16:01.040 --> 16:06.080]  of a Syrian rebel group cutting a guy's heart out and eating it.
[16:07.920 --> 16:15.760]  And these are the groups, but even in the British news, the public is now outraged.
[16:15.760 --> 16:21.200]  The BBC reports over the fact that, quote, the West is funding al-Qaeda. See, that's another
[16:21.200 --> 16:26.000]  reason Obama's in so much trouble. They've got to burn somebody for this. This is a larger
[16:26.640 --> 16:33.200]  global policy to create radical jihadis, to fund radical Muslims, and then to allow them to attack
[16:33.200 --> 16:41.680]  or to provocateur them into attacks. And this is all on record. So see, that realization,
[16:41.680 --> 16:48.320]  that realization is now coming to the forefront of people's minds. And there's a total loss of
[16:48.320 --> 16:53.840]  credibility. Last night, I don't go out late very often, I went out and heard some amazing
[16:53.840 --> 17:02.960]  rockabilly music at a dive bar in East Austin. With Hank Hill and Beavis and Butthead, I was
[17:02.960 --> 17:07.520]  hanging out with all of them. Literally, Mike Judge, what a cool guy, man, he is something
[17:07.520 --> 17:16.320]  else. And we went out for about five hours. And I talked to countless people who were listeners,
[17:18.080 --> 17:23.200]  who said, man, it's all coming out. And everybody I talked to says they're now waking up.
[17:23.920 --> 17:29.600]  And wow, your show's almost passÃ© now. Just a few years ago, you were saying they're spying
[17:29.600 --> 17:34.080]  on you without warrants, and they'd never do that. That's a police day. And again, I'm not
[17:34.080 --> 17:38.720]  bragging that I'm out in Austin and people are coming up saying, hey, people are waking up.
[17:38.720 --> 17:42.880]  I'm bragging that they're waking up. I'm giving you a good report.
[17:45.520 --> 17:50.080]  Because people now really get that they're sinister forces, and that we better get back
[17:50.080 --> 17:57.920]  to what made America great, keeping government on a very, very short leash. Very, very, very, very
[17:57.920 --> 18:08.240]  short leash. I tell you, I needed it to blow some steam off. I really love good rockabilly music.
[18:08.240 --> 18:14.960]  It was great stuff I was listening to last night. Really enjoyable, man, it's great live music.
[18:16.240 --> 18:20.480]  I think I'm gonna go out and see Weldon Henson Wednesday night. It's his drummer that was in
[18:20.480 --> 18:26.720]  this other band. He's also in the derailers. Man, it was good. You know what I'm gonna do?
[18:26.720 --> 18:35.120]  You know what I'm gonna do? I'm gonna go to break. I'm gonna reset and untangle my mind.
[18:36.560 --> 18:38.240]  And then we are going to
[18:41.600 --> 18:45.680]  get into all the different gates. The son of Watergate, as it's being called
[18:45.680 --> 18:53.040]  by Drudge up at drudgereport.com. It's also all up at infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[18:53.040 --> 18:56.800]  Paul Joseph Watson has an article liberals defend Obama for spying on media.
[18:57.840 --> 19:01.600]  At first it wasn't happening and now the White House connected and run
[19:01.600 --> 19:06.480]  groups means it's literally White House groups are coming out saying it's no big deal.
[19:07.440 --> 19:13.440]  No big deal. Nothing to worry about Mr. Gopher. Not a plastic explosive or anything.
[19:13.440 --> 19:18.160]  Nothing to worry about. And then we've got CIA cannibal eats dead Syrian soldiers heart.
[19:18.160 --> 19:24.560]  Rand Paul, AP phone spying proves Obama is drunk on power. That clips coming up.
[19:24.560 --> 19:30.240]  Drudge says assume all communications are being monitored. The White House says it had no idea
[19:30.240 --> 19:37.920]  the DOJ sees the AP's phone records. Same IRS that targeted conservatives will demand your private
[19:37.920 --> 19:44.080]  health insurance records. Leaked docs, IRS targeting conservatives and what media called
[19:44.080 --> 19:48.560]  conspiracy. And I haven't even gotten into the, I'm going to cover it all when we come back,

[21:29.920 --> 21:34.160]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson. Have you ever wondered why banks, stock workers, investment advisors
[21:34.160 --> 21:38.480]  won't talk about gold IRAs? They've been available since 1986, yet the financial
[21:38.480 --> 21:42.560]  industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement. Gold is outperformed
[21:42.560 --> 21:47.200]  paper investments, yet no word about IRAs. If you would like to have gold for your retirement,
[21:47.200 --> 21:55.520]  call 800-686-2237. Don't get left behind by rising inflation and low returns, call 800-686-2237.

[24:04.080 --> 24:14.320]  Day after day. Alone on a hill. A man with a foolish grin. The foolish grin is keeping
[24:14.320 --> 24:22.880]  perfectly still. But nobody wants to know him. They can see that he's just a fool.
[24:24.240 --> 24:35.440]  And he never gives an answer. But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down. And the eyes
[24:35.440 --> 24:42.320]  in his head see the world spin round. That's right. Who's the real fool out there? They tell
[24:42.320 --> 24:49.360]  you it's wise to follow the mainstream corporate media that absolutely has bad will towards you.
[24:51.040 --> 24:54.080]  You know that. You don't need Alex Jones to tell you that. I don't have all the answers.
[24:54.640 --> 24:58.880]  I'm trying to figure it all out. I just know these people are a pack of crooks and a pack of
[24:58.880 --> 25:05.280]  liars and fellow travelers with corruption. And I am not part of them. And I'm saying clearly,
[25:05.280 --> 25:12.560]  I'm not with you. I don't wanna be with you. I want away from you. And I want you out of my life.
[25:12.560 --> 25:17.440]  I want free association. I wanna keep my money. I wanna keep the fruit of my own labor
[25:17.440 --> 25:21.360]  so I can work with people I wanna work with and build a civilization.
[25:22.160 --> 25:26.560]  You control freaks telling us how all day how we didn't build this or we didn't do that.
[25:27.360 --> 25:32.800]  And lecturing us that parents aren't really parents of their kids and the state is,
[25:32.800 --> 25:38.480]  listen, you freaks, keep drinking your own Kool-Aid, keep smoking your own dope.
[25:39.520 --> 25:44.480]  Because the only people buying your bull are you and your minions.
[25:47.760 --> 25:54.400]  Tyrants always fall, ladies and gentlemen, but it's a tectonic battle that goes on and on,
[25:54.400 --> 26:00.400]  on and on and on. It isn't a zero sum game where either one side totally wins,
[26:00.400 --> 26:04.960]  the other side totally loses. You only totally lose if you give in to pure evil.
[26:05.840 --> 26:08.400]  And I don't wanna get into the philosophic anymore. The point is,
[26:10.880 --> 26:16.560]  is that there is a war going on. There's always a war going on between freedom and tyranny.
[26:17.200 --> 26:22.960]  Now you better decide what side you're on. It's very simple. Let's go to these headlines here.
[26:22.960 --> 26:26.880]  We'll come back with your calls in the next segment at 800-25-99231.
[26:26.880 --> 26:36.720]  Dr. McCann, please look at this. White House says it had no idea the DOJ seized the AP's
[26:36.720 --> 26:43.360]  phone records. I'm sure and they didn't know about Benghazi and they didn't know about the IRS.
[26:43.360 --> 26:48.960]  And Eric Holder, he didn't know about Fast and Furious either. And they didn't know anything
[26:48.960 --> 26:54.400]  about anything. Other than press reports, we had no knowledge of any attempt by the Justice
[26:54.400 --> 27:01.040]  Department to seek phone records from the AP to try to go after leakers. Leakers exposing their
[27:01.040 --> 27:06.640]  criminal activities. And by the way, ladies and gentlemen, they have the FBI Deputy Head
[27:06.640 --> 27:12.000]  of Counterterrorism on CNN a week and a half ago. We played the clip several times. It was in the
[27:13.040 --> 27:16.880]  New York Times, you name it. And the media is like, well, that's reasonable.
[27:16.880 --> 27:20.160]  They're trying to keep us safe. Every phone call, every email is recorded.
[27:20.160 --> 27:24.000]  And so once you're a person of interest, that doesn't violate the Fourth Amendment,
[27:24.000 --> 27:27.680]  then they go back to the recording. They'd be like your neighbor saying,
[27:27.680 --> 27:31.360]  I'm gonna plant a camera in your bedroom to watch you and your wife have sex.
[27:31.360 --> 27:35.920]  Just in case down the road, if you ever do something bad to her, let's just say you kill her,
[27:36.720 --> 27:41.200]  cuz you're guilty until proven innocent. Then I can go back and see the video feed
[27:41.200 --> 27:47.920]  we're gonna be capturing live. That's the equivalent of the absurdist nature of this.
[27:47.920 --> 27:53.600]  And so, they're in the news, the New York Times going, and by the way, Obama wants to fix
[27:54.480 --> 27:58.400]  the wiretapping system. He wants to just be able to do it without warrants.
[27:59.040 --> 28:04.400]  And just go ahead and have everything wired through the NSA. It's already been done. And
[28:04.400 --> 28:12.960]  that's what the FBI Deputy Director said on CNN. He said, well, we can't really use this in a trial,
[28:12.960 --> 28:18.480]  but everything's been recorded. Everything's been saved. Well, we already know that from the
[28:18.480 --> 28:25.920]  Telecommunications Act they put in place back in 96. It paid the $9 billion. And by law,
[28:25.920 --> 28:30.560]  the telecommunications companies, by October 1st, 2001, they had five years to do it.
[28:31.120 --> 28:40.720]  They had to have it in place to where they could go back and find the recording system.
[28:40.720 --> 28:43.360]  They could go back and find the recordings of everything.
[28:44.400 --> 28:51.040]  And it's all there in the law. Doesn't mean it's constitutional. It's a law on infrastructure,
[28:51.040 --> 28:56.800]  just like cybersecurity just basically legalizes the warrantless wiretapping.
[28:56.800 --> 28:59.520]  But you can't legalize something that's unconstitutional.
[29:02.160 --> 29:07.440]  So this is what's going on. The White House says it had no idea the DOJ sees the AP's
[29:07.440 --> 29:16.000]  phone records. I know nothing. Remember Hogan's heroes, Sergeant Schultz? I know nothing, nothing.
[29:17.120 --> 29:23.280]  That's pretty good, Sergeant Schultz. Damn it, Bobby. Continuing, government probe
[29:23.280 --> 29:30.880]  obtains wide swath of AP phone records. Butane is a bastard gas.
[29:30.880 --> 29:38.720]  I better stop and kill limitations. Government probe obtains wide swath of AP phone records.
[29:39.600 --> 29:42.960]  Under sweeping subpoenas, Justice Department obtained AP phone records
[29:42.960 --> 29:46.080]  in leak investigation. And if they were already spying,
[29:46.080 --> 29:49.600]  they went to get the subpoena to make legal what they already had.
[29:49.600 --> 30:00.800]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[30:00.800 --> 30:06.400]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms. But if you don't have a home security system,
[30:06.400 --> 30:10.240]  then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[30:10.240 --> 30:13.600]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[30:13.600 --> 30:19.600]  Check out SimpliSafe. It's a new do-it-yourself home security system that is completely wireless.

[32:59.040 --> 33:18.240]  catalog. I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the
[33:18.240 --> 33:30.240]  mind of man, Thomas Jefferson. Okay, so let's run through the headlines and then to your phone calls
[33:31.120 --> 33:40.720]  here today. Yes, this is Watergate. This is much bigger than Watergate. Benghazi is much more
[33:40.720 --> 33:44.960]  hardcore and serious and a loss of life than Watergate. I'm not saying Richard Nixon was a
[33:44.960 --> 33:51.600]  good guy. I certainly would have supported his impeachment and stepping down. But Benghazi
[33:51.600 --> 33:57.360]  standing down while people got killed, being caught lying about it, ordering the stand downs,
[33:57.360 --> 34:01.200]  using Al Qaeda security forces they'd hired to run Benghazi to do it.
[34:03.040 --> 34:09.920]  It's just their policies are so Machiavelli, so evil and they're in plain view.
[34:09.920 --> 34:14.640]  So you've got that going on. And I think the power structure, I think I don't think I know,
[34:14.640 --> 34:19.040]  they're scared that the public is finally understood that the Global Crime Syndicate
[34:19.040 --> 34:25.040]  runs Al Qaeda. And so the rats are now leaving the sinking ship because they're afraid the
[34:25.040 --> 34:31.520]  sinking ship may blow up and they don't want to be taken down with it. It's really that simple.
[34:32.160 --> 34:37.920]  You're seeing a stampede of fear away from Obama. But more than that, his own minions don't like
[34:37.920 --> 34:45.920]  him. His own minions don't like the dishonorableness of it. It's creepy. And so the completely amoral
[34:47.120 --> 34:52.960]  behavior of Obama and his controllers is really setting him up for a giant fall.
[34:52.960 --> 34:59.120]  Now I'll say this again. You've got the IRS scandal going after groups. I was reading the
[34:59.120 --> 35:06.400]  quotes yesterday where the Inspector General was breaking down the directives. And it said,
[35:06.400 --> 35:17.040]  people that promote the Constitution, that's a quote, people that are fearful of big government,
[35:17.040 --> 35:22.960]  people that don't trust the government. I mean, America is founded on don't trust the government.
[35:22.960 --> 35:27.680]  If you don't like that, get out of America. Because everywhere else, governments are like
[35:27.680 --> 35:35.200]  North Korea in history. Thank God our forebearers tried to tie down government. It's certainly been
[35:35.200 --> 35:39.600]  corrupt and out of control, but nothing compared to other countries because we had some basic
[35:39.600 --> 35:45.520]  checks and balances. And I know I'm preaching. But they ordered this spying. They've been spying
[35:45.520 --> 35:51.520]  on whistleblowers and persecuting them. Folks, I've had so many sources in the last 18 years.
[35:53.200 --> 35:55.600]  And I've developed some really good ones the last 10 or so,
[35:56.160 --> 36:00.960]  as people have learned that I won't ever give up sources. And the last four or five years,
[36:00.960 --> 36:05.600]  I mean, my sources have dried up to almost nothing because they're all scared. I mean,
[36:05.600 --> 36:09.200]  I don't wanna do the globalist job for them and scare people from whistleblowing.
[36:09.200 --> 36:13.760]  The whistleblowers already know this and they've been told. The memos have come out where they
[36:13.760 --> 36:17.440]  threaten people in the federal government. Even if they know crimes are being committed,
[36:17.440 --> 36:23.840]  they're not to report it to even another agency or they can be prosecuted. Prosecuted by kangaroo
[36:23.840 --> 36:29.840]  courts. I mean, reporting on crime outside of your agency is totally protected under common law,
[36:29.840 --> 36:36.080]  Bill of Rights, Constitution, jurisprudence, precedence, and it's being overthrown.
[36:36.080 --> 36:40.880]  That's how you know these are really bad people. And I mean, I'll have a FEMA person on.
[36:42.720 --> 36:51.200]  They will mail me info. They will say, please call me at this number from another line,
[36:51.200 --> 36:57.440]  you know, not part of your phone system. I'll call them. And this happened a few years ago.
[36:57.440 --> 37:03.600]  And then they, you know, give me more info. I call, I check the information, it breaks.
[37:04.560 --> 37:08.240]  And then they call them a week later and say, my God, they called me in, they know it's me.
[37:08.880 --> 37:13.520]  And they've been listening to my phone. They're listening to everybody, ladies and gentlemen.
[37:14.880 --> 37:18.880]  But something's happening. People in government are getting to the point of going, you know what,
[37:18.880 --> 37:23.680]  I don't care. And I think if you're going to go public, do it like Cebel Edmonds.
[37:23.680 --> 37:29.360]  Go have a press conference. Ahmad Salam was given the bomb, real detonators. He said,
[37:29.360 --> 37:33.440]  are you going to blow up the World Trade Center for real in 1993? I didn't sign on for this.
[37:33.440 --> 37:37.760]  And he knew they were setting him up. So he recorded them. And then he went and gave a
[37:37.760 --> 37:42.320]  press conference with his lawyer with the recordings and the transcripts for the media.
[37:42.320 --> 37:48.000]  And so they paid him off 1.4 mil. And instead of going to prison, he got paid and got to leave
[37:48.000 --> 37:53.840]  the country. Now, what's the moral of that story? If you're going to whistle blow,
[37:55.440 --> 38:00.320]  go put it on YouTube, shoot your own video, hold up your documents, say what you're doing,
[38:00.320 --> 38:04.480]  send it out to 100 media outlets, and some of them will have the courage.
[38:04.480 --> 38:09.040]  You saw the FBI and the Boston bombing going, don't look at drills and don't look at any photos
[38:09.040 --> 38:15.440]  this guy's got. Only look at what we give you. And Badandi said there were several hundred press
[38:15.440 --> 38:19.920]  in that huge briefing room, Boston bombing, worldwide press conference. We have the video,
[38:19.920 --> 38:27.200]  it was hundreds, over 200, guesstimating. And none of them would dare go look at his info or
[38:27.200 --> 38:31.520]  ask questions. They nodded their heads and a few of them, including some mainstream media people
[38:31.520 --> 38:35.440]  that are very well recognized, they wanted to be off record. They came over to Dan and the other
[38:35.440 --> 38:39.760]  guys, our camera guys after and said, we want to say you've got incredible courage.
[38:39.760 --> 38:43.520]  They said something else. They said, you got giant you know what? We admire you,
[38:43.520 --> 38:49.200]  we admire what Infowars is doing, we're scared. And we know this is a stage deal.
[38:50.080 --> 38:55.120]  And or we know something's fishy was the quote. And then I talked to another big national reporter,
[38:55.120 --> 38:58.960]  and he's like, I think something's fishy. No, I agree with you, they're covering up.
[38:59.760 --> 39:05.360]  Well, come on, come on. I mean, we can't just sit here forever and just put up with
[39:05.360 --> 39:10.000]  anything that doesn't protect society. It destroys society. Are we mice or men?
[39:10.000 --> 39:13.680]  I mean, who are we? I mean, are we going to put up with anything out of these people?
[39:13.680 --> 39:22.560]  And I had a state police officer, he wasn't out of Kansas, I mean, out of Missouri.
[39:24.720 --> 39:32.720]  See, I don't lie on air, except I will involuntarily to cover resources.
[39:32.720 --> 39:40.320]  I will scramble where the stuff came from sometimes. It was state police,
[39:40.320 --> 39:50.240]  but it was not state police in Kansas City in Missouri that gave us the info.
[39:50.240 --> 39:58.160]  It was a California senior member of the state police who was at a federal meeting in Missouri.
[39:58.160 --> 40:07.760]  So technically, it was Missouri, but they still found out who he was and went after him
[40:08.960 --> 40:15.520]  and demoted him. I was given information by a federal marshal.
[40:19.360 --> 40:22.720]  They found out about that. I mean, they're listening to the phones.
[40:22.720 --> 40:29.040]  You know, I sit there with members of the press, I was sitting there with the Esquire,
[40:29.040 --> 40:33.520]  and I'm going, listen, they've called up my wife and said what she was just talking about.
[40:33.520 --> 40:38.080]  And they've done it to me before to let you know they're tapping your phones. Believe me,
[40:38.080 --> 40:42.640]  we're not in Kansas anymore. And the guy looked at me and did not believe me.
[40:43.840 --> 40:50.320]  Because these people are naive, ladies and gentlemen. And what's happening is,
[40:50.320 --> 40:55.600]  America is losing its naivete. I'll go to calls, as I promise. I'm gonna go to your
[40:55.600 --> 41:00.160]  calls right now or I never will. Then I'll get into all the details of the IRS, the Benghazi gate,
[41:02.000 --> 41:09.440]  the spying on the AP. And again, it's just like the deputy director of counterterrorism
[41:11.920 --> 41:17.200]  said on CNN. You guys pull that article up, I forget his name. We played it twice last week.
[41:17.200 --> 41:21.200]  It was all over the news, you saw it. He said, well, no, no, we can't really use this in court.
[41:21.200 --> 41:25.200]  But then once something happens, we can go back, we have it recorded, and then we can get
[41:25.840 --> 41:29.600]  a subpoena and stuff and use it in court. See, that's what they're doing. They're illegally
[41:29.600 --> 41:34.720]  spying on everything. And then when they wanna use it in court, they go get a subpoena.
[41:36.000 --> 41:40.400]  It's kinda like shopping. It's kinda like they go and dig through your drawers
[41:41.440 --> 41:44.240]  without a warrant. It's not kinda like that's exactly what they do. They can't
[41:44.240 --> 41:47.840]  without a warrant. It's not kinda like that's exactly what they do. They kinda go and dig
[41:47.840 --> 41:51.280]  through all your dresser drawers, dig through all your stuff, your bank accounts. And then if they
[41:51.280 --> 41:56.000]  find something or plant something, that's the bigger issue. Then they go and get the warrant
[41:56.000 --> 42:00.720]  to make it all on the up and up. And now they're too lazy to do that. We don't even wanna do that.
[42:04.320 --> 42:10.240]  I was talking to some Texas Rangers who came in here threatening a subpoena. If I didn't give
[42:10.240 --> 42:17.200]  them a source on some Marines that were in the same unit, gave us photos of the supposed shooter
[42:17.200 --> 42:24.960]  of Chris Kyle, the most deadly sniper author. And they came over here and they said, well,
[42:24.960 --> 42:29.120]  we'll come back with a subpoena. Then I called them back later and I made some other phone calls.
[42:29.120 --> 42:32.160]  I got the guy's card in there. Can you bring me that card in there? It's hanging on Chris's
[42:32.160 --> 42:37.360]  computer, at least it was last week. And I call them up and they're like, Alex, don't worry about
[42:37.360 --> 42:42.640]  it. We got it another way. And then I ran into one of these Texas Rangers later. They're like,
[42:42.640 --> 42:47.120]  oh, we got ways of getting stuff. And I went, what? Data mining snooping from third party
[42:47.120 --> 42:53.440]  companies? He goes, you said it, not me. I mean, here it is. Gary Phillips, Texas Ranger.
[42:54.320 --> 42:59.040]  I talk about stuff like this and the trolls go, there's no Texas Rangers at your office.
[42:59.040 --> 43:04.320]  There's no secret service at your office. When they come up here with subpoenas and gag orders
[43:04.320 --> 43:11.840]  and stuff and later it's in the Associated Press a year later. When some idiot listener puts threats
[43:11.840 --> 43:20.000]  on info wars.com. It's just this is the real world is what I'm telling you. This is the real world.
[43:20.000 --> 43:24.400]  And instead of it intimidating us, we need to be like the state police in Colorado.
[43:25.120 --> 43:29.680]  When they go to these meetings and the FEMA tells them this is restricted, not classified,
[43:29.680 --> 43:34.400]  but restricted. What are state police doing in meetings where it's quasi classified?
[43:34.400 --> 43:38.160]  That just means they don't want this info out to the public. They use that to protect
[43:38.160 --> 43:43.040]  the criminality. We want to know if you're ready to confiscate guns from Christians.
[43:43.040 --> 43:46.320]  And then they're sitting there with three FEMA guys in the room,
[43:46.320 --> 43:51.440]  monitoring the room full of 100 state police senior officers to see,
[43:52.800 --> 43:56.720]  senior troopers to see who is a patriot, who isn't. They're running
[43:56.720 --> 44:00.640]  psyops. They're running clandestine operations against America.
[44:02.720 --> 44:07.440]  They're finding out who's a criminal. I mean, they're getting on MSNBC and saying your kids
[44:07.440 --> 44:15.520]  don't belong to you in ads. They're just trying to normalize all this. And we don't need it to
[44:15.520 --> 44:21.920]  be normalized. We need to throw this up. This is poison. I hate to use the analogy, but have
[44:21.920 --> 44:32.720]  you ever had bad food and it's not sitting right? And one time I'm college went to a restaurant and
[44:32.720 --> 44:37.280]  all you could eat. And my two buddies got real sick the next day with that night with food
[44:37.280 --> 44:43.360]  poisoning. And I'm not somebody that gets nauseous very often, but it didn't sit right.
[44:43.360 --> 44:50.160]  It tasted weird. And I just had a gut feeling and went in the bathroom and threw up and got it out.
[44:50.160 --> 44:57.440]  And I mean, I didn't get very sick. They did. The point is, is that you've got to recognize
[44:57.440 --> 45:01.600]  poison. And I know I'm preaching. It's just these people are poisoned. And the answer is,
[45:01.600 --> 45:05.840]  do not be afraid of all the fact that they're spying on us. Good. I hope you're listening,
[45:05.840 --> 45:10.640]  criminals, because you're the people that have something to hide and we're going to expose you.
[45:11.840 --> 45:16.240]  And we're going to route you out. And we're not intimidated. We're not intimidated that
[45:16.240 --> 45:23.680]  you're listening to us, crooks. That indies you. The answer is all of us getting active. Good. You
[45:23.680 --> 45:27.600]  know what they'll see on the radar screen? A million blips coming at them. You're not
[45:27.600 --> 45:33.120]  going to knock that down. You're not going to stop that. It's the mass effect. They cannot stop
[45:33.120 --> 45:36.960]  a mass awakening effect. And that's what's happening right now. So they're desperately
[45:36.960 --> 45:42.640]  trying to normalize it with a normalcy bias of flaunting all this and it's not going to work.
[45:42.640 --> 45:48.880]  Jason in Florida. Thanks for holding. What do you think about Obama meltdown gate,
[45:48.880 --> 45:54.160]  chilling like a villain? Obviously he's a disgusting puppet and everything, but
[45:54.160 --> 45:59.040]  bringing down their prize puppet, I believe will be a great defeat to the new world order.
[45:59.040 --> 46:04.720]  What do you say? Well, honestly, Alex, I really just got to admit with everything you're saying,
[46:04.720 --> 46:09.600]  I try to find fault with what you're saying. I really do. But I've got to admit, I mean,
[46:09.600 --> 46:15.280]  these, uh, this type of stuff goes all the way back to, uh, to J. Edgar Uber. They collect
[46:15.280 --> 46:21.280]  information, get the subpoenas later. I mean, we've got to seize on what we've got now. We've got
[46:21.280 --> 46:27.440]  the AP scandal. We've got the IRS key party, the Benghazi people forgotten about fast and furious.
[46:27.440 --> 46:32.240]  We've got to remind them. We've got to call our senators. We've got to contact them. We've got
[46:32.240 --> 46:38.160]  to demand that they investigate this. We've got to seize on what we have now. And we've got to
[46:38.160 --> 46:44.160]  move forward with that. We can't just allow this to be, you know, another business as usual type
[46:44.160 --> 46:52.240]  of situation. I agree with you. And if we ask the question, will Obama politically with his
[46:53.280 --> 47:04.320]  gang of miscreants, gang of arrogant, arrogant twits, will they succeed? That's up to us.
[47:04.320 --> 47:08.320]  I don't think they're going to get away with this if we, if we use this against them. And
[47:08.320 --> 47:12.480]  now is the time to hammer down. And this is going to give everybody else cover. That's why
[47:12.480 --> 47:16.000]  Mitch McConnell and others are saying a lot more is coming. They've known all this stuff.
[47:16.000 --> 47:20.240]  They've been scared to use it. It's all going to start coming out and it's going to get very,
[47:20.240 --> 47:26.880]  very nasty. Since 2010, 2011, we know who the criminals are. They're Eric Holder.
[47:26.880 --> 47:31.360]  They're Hillary Clinton. They're Barack Obama. We've got to seize. Now we've got to,
[47:31.360 --> 47:34.800]  we've got to just make sure that our congressmen and our Senate,
[47:35.360 --> 47:39.920]  you know, go after this aggressively. I mean, it's, it's just now or never.
[47:41.440 --> 47:45.760]  Absolutely. And, and, and again, not let all their creepy police state stuff scare us. So when
[47:45.760 --> 47:50.080]  I say police state, I don't mean the average cop. I mean, police state, North Korea. I mean,
[47:50.080 --> 47:55.440]  the political control of the police is going into a very dangerous area. It needs to be reversed.
[47:55.440 --> 48:01.760]  I appreciate your call. Great points, Jason. Let's talk to another Jason in Alabama. You're
[48:01.760 --> 48:10.000]  on the air, Jason. Hi Alex. Longtime listener. First time caller. I want to agree that I don't
[48:10.000 --> 48:14.320]  think Hillary can get out of this. You know, all of this happened on her watch. It's not enough,
[48:14.320 --> 48:18.960]  though. Hillary, Hillary's not enough. They all need to go to jail. But I definitely agree with
[48:18.960 --> 48:23.760]  you on that one. Honestly, I don't see how Obama can get out of this considering, you know, he came
[48:23.760 --> 48:29.040]  out, I think it was two weeks after, after the attack happened in front of the UN and three
[48:29.040 --> 48:33.760]  separate times, he blamed the YouTube video. And then he came out just a couple of days ago and
[48:33.760 --> 48:38.080]  said that two days after the attack happened, they knew it was terrorist. They knew everything about
[48:38.080 --> 48:46.400]  it. I mean, he's been caught in a major lie in just the past few days. Yes. And now he's saying,
[48:46.400 --> 48:51.680]  I know nothing about Benghazi. I know neither does Hillary. I know nothing about IRS gate
[48:51.680 --> 48:56.000]  and it's intimidation. It's spying. It's harassment. I know nothing about spying on
[48:56.000 --> 49:01.600]  the media. Eric Holder did it. Okay. Well, Eric Holder, then there needs to be hearings.
[49:01.600 --> 49:06.560]  He needs to be indicted, but he's the justice department. How do you indict the guy that's
[49:06.560 --> 49:14.800]  over that? You can't have Hitler over the Nuremberg trials. I'm not sure exactly how we
[49:14.800 --> 49:19.280]  get a special prosecutor. You have a special prosecutor, but then there'll be political
[49:19.280 --> 49:24.400]  and drag it out over several years. We don't need that. We need grand juries. We need state
[49:24.400 --> 49:31.680]  movements. We need the media to call for Obama to resign now, along with Biden. I mean, we need to
[49:31.680 --> 49:35.360]  get rid of these criminals. They're dangerous. And here's the other question. You think they
[49:35.360 --> 49:40.800]  might stage something to try to get out of this? Could staging something get them out of this?
[49:42.400 --> 49:45.840]  Well, I think, I think a couple of these different things that have shown up in the,
[49:45.840 --> 49:50.640]  in the news the last couple of days have been, might have been, been trying to release new
[49:50.640 --> 49:57.120]  information to get our attention off of Benghazi. Well, I agree. Benghazi is the ordered stand down
[49:57.920 --> 50:01.520]  and it's murder. And they have been caught red handed and the whole military knows it because
[50:01.520 --> 50:06.480]  there were so many witnesses in those situation rooms of NATO, the army, the Navy, the Marines,
[50:07.840 --> 50:12.720]  CENTCOM, all of it. There were probably, let's be conservative, a thousand people that are more,
[50:12.720 --> 50:17.280]  they estimate, I've seen different estimates that we're watching different live feeds of that going
[50:17.280 --> 50:23.920]  on and know it was a stand down. And so as bad as IRS gate and phone hacking gate and all this is,
[50:24.720 --> 50:30.240]  it is nothing compared to that, but they know the media wants to go with all these stories.
[50:30.240 --> 50:35.360]  And so now allowing some of that, see, the average media is kept on a very short leash.
[50:36.960 --> 50:41.760]  And I think it's more than them distracting, but I think that's kind of the hope.
[50:41.760 --> 50:44.720]  But I don't think that's going to work. I think it just piles onto Benghazi.
[50:47.520 --> 50:52.000]  Well, that is Machiavelli and burning themself is a distraction from the big one.
[50:52.000 --> 50:55.440]  Because yeah, I mean, I mean, you're talking trees and stuff with Benghazi,
[50:55.440 --> 51:12.160]  not just your run of the mill corruption. We'll be right back. Stay with us more calls.

[53:59.280 --> 54:14.400]  All right, we'll continue with calls into the next hour. We're going to get an update on all the
[54:14.400 --> 54:21.600]  different activities of Monsanto and their bio warfare system. I'll also get into Russia to
[54:21.600 --> 54:26.960]  expel US diplomat who they caught with wigs and all these fake glasses and stuff. Our media is
[54:26.960 --> 54:36.880]  like, he's not CIA. And of course, it's some yuppie surfer dude. One of the underling diplomats,
[54:36.880 --> 54:43.440]  they're running around with wigs and glasses, probably had fake noses playing the part of a spy
[54:43.440 --> 54:50.400]  with a bag of money and instructions for the Russian. Oh yeah, I mean, let's run around with
[54:50.400 --> 54:54.560]  written instructions. It's just these people are, see, the average yuppie thinks if they
[54:54.560 --> 55:00.320]  joined the CIA, it like suddenly they get like wings like Icarus and they can fly around and
[55:00.320 --> 55:07.520]  they're all powerful and cool. And it's the new class system where if you're in government,
[55:07.520 --> 55:14.240]  you talking to your earpiece and you strut around. And I mean, I've been in DC and had
[55:14.240 --> 55:18.240]  Secret Service run over to me just anywhere in the city trying to videotape anything and go,
[55:18.240 --> 55:25.440]  I'm Secret Service. I'm diplomatic security, you little filth. They're all just puffed up and
[55:25.440 --> 55:31.520]  they've arrived. There's somebody, why, they're with the government. I mean, move to North Korea.
[55:34.080 --> 55:40.720]  It's just a bunch of idiots running around acting tough, hiring Al-Qaeda to commit mass murder all
[55:40.720 --> 55:49.840]  over Syria. And they put out propaganda videos eating people's hearts. Leaders of the Free Syria
[55:49.840 --> 55:54.080]  Army, the Al-Qaeda group, and now even mainstream news admits they're Al-Qaeda. And then they've
[55:54.080 --> 55:57.840]  got this guy with a guy's heart with all the aorta arteries hanging off the top of it.
[55:58.880 --> 56:04.480]  And he's chewing on it like a rat or something. Outrage at Syrian rebels shown eating soldiers
[56:04.480 --> 56:10.640]  heart. And all that's gonna do is make the Syrians fight harder. I mean, what you think some punk
[56:11.200 --> 56:16.080]  chewing on somebody's heart is gonna scare everyone and you're chewing on someone's heart,
[56:16.080 --> 56:21.920]  we'll give in to you now. But that's what criminals always do. They dominate,
[56:21.920 --> 56:26.880]  they intimidate, and then they think, if I just intimidate more, it'll make everyone bow down to
[56:26.880 --> 56:31.200]  me. No, no, no, you don't get it. People were just trying to be nice and stay out of your way
[56:31.200 --> 56:34.640]  until you pushed it, and you pushed it, and you pushed it.
[56:36.240 --> 56:39.760]  We're gonna go to break here in a moment, come back with the next hour, and I promise go right
[56:39.760 --> 56:43.360]  to your calls. I wanna hear what you think about Obamagate and where all this is going.
[56:44.400 --> 56:48.000]  Think about how they've denied they're spying on us and now it's all admitted.
[56:48.960 --> 56:56.480]  And then I've got articles here where the so-called left is defending Obama.
[56:56.480 --> 57:01.680]  And they're in the news, I've got the articles, I'm gonna cover it in the next hour. Defending
[57:01.680 --> 57:09.280]  spying on tea parties and harassing tea parties and using the IRS to demand records of who came
[57:09.280 --> 57:14.160]  to tea party meetings like it's the Soviet Union. That's why they're gonna use the IRS to
[57:14.880 --> 57:18.560]  get your medical records now. That's why they're gonna use it to enforce everything.
[57:19.360 --> 57:25.680]  Because it's the unconstitutional criminal group that will do whatever they're told.
[57:25.680 --> 57:32.720]  It is outrageous. Now, before I go any further, just briefly at the end of this hour,
[57:32.720 --> 57:35.920]  there is a revolution happening of awakening against tyranny.
[57:35.920 --> 57:39.600]  And the biggest and best thing you can do is spread the word about this broadcast

[01:00:21.120 --> 01:00:32.160]  Jones. All right, we're into the second hour. Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:40.640]  We are here Monday through Friday, 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Central. Obviously, Obama is preparing,
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:48.640]  if this continues to go this direction, for his Waterloo, his Trenton, his Battle of the Bulge.
[01:00:48.640 --> 01:00:53.040]  What does that say for the collectivist, though, and why is that happening? That's why I've opened
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:01:00.160]  the phones up. I'd like to get your take on it. 800-259-9231. I do have the Russia to expel
[01:01:00.160 --> 01:01:05.680]  US CIA operative, they're saying. We're gonna talk about police shootings up all over the country.
[01:01:05.680 --> 01:01:09.920]  Actual crime rates are way down, but police shootings are way up. So we're gonna look at
[01:01:09.920 --> 01:01:14.400]  why is that? And I know the answer, at least the biggest portion of the answer, a lot of
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:19.840]  contributing factors. The latest on Syria, the latest on the abortion doctor, Kermit,
[01:01:19.840 --> 01:01:25.680]  found guilty, a real victory for liberty. These were babies outside the womb that were viable.
[01:01:25.680 --> 01:01:30.560]  They'd have to drown and now convicted or chop up. So that's coming up as well.
[01:01:32.240 --> 01:01:36.480]  Let's go to the next caller. Who's up next here, John?
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:43.280]  Geraldine in New York, you're on the air.
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:49.680]  Hi, Alex, thank you for taking my call. A listener for almost two years and I
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:52.240]  subscribe to Infowars magazine. Thank you.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:02:00.000]  And I've been awakened for 15 years now. And I don't think that Barack Obama is going to
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:07.360]  take the fall because there were too many people on his side. How do you think he got reelected?
[01:02:07.360 --> 01:02:12.080]  Well, that's the more cynical view. And I think there's some of that,
[01:02:12.080 --> 01:02:17.040]  at least like Hitler in the bunker. They think that, oh, let them know we're listening to them.
[01:02:17.040 --> 01:02:20.720]  Let them know we're gonna persecute them. Maybe that'll intimidate everybody. We've
[01:02:20.720 --> 01:02:24.480]  gotta normalize the fact that we're gonna persecute everybody.
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:29.120]  Because we're in control, nobody can stop us, just like they've persecuted the whistleblowers.
[01:02:29.120 --> 01:02:34.400]  You would think that would turn the whole press against Obama. I mean, if Nixon or Reagan or Bush
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:37.760]  tried something like this, or Clinton even, it would be the end of them.
[01:02:37.760 --> 01:02:40.640]  I mean, the hardcore persecution of whistleblowers in the press,
[01:02:41.440 --> 01:02:46.880]  some would say that it's a panopticon effect. That's a French system where they'd have a tower
[01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:52.480]  in the middle of a circular cell block. Three stories was the first French model of this.
[01:02:52.480 --> 01:02:57.440]  You guys pull up a panopticon prison and click Google or startpage.com, it'll have the images.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:03:04.080]  And they had jail guards watching. So you felt like you were always being watched.
[01:03:04.080 --> 01:03:10.560]  You didn't have privacy. You had bars instead of a steel door to make you feel dehumanized
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:15.120]  and to make you feel like you were always being watched. So even when you weren't being watched,
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:17.840]  or even if they were watching, they couldn't enforce on everybody.
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:22.640]  But you would then self-censor yourself. So there could be a panopticonic effect.
[01:03:22.640 --> 01:03:32.160]  Well, I know you think I sound cynical, but I just have seen it happen so many times since
[01:03:32.160 --> 01:03:38.320]  Clinton and all the things that he did, and his wife, of course. And nothing ever happened to
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:43.920]  them. Look how many people that they know are dead. I mean, how many people that you know-
[01:03:43.920 --> 01:03:45.760]  Arconsighted, you mean? Arconsighted?
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:51.040]  Right? No, no, I hear you. I'm just distracted
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:58.720]  by listening to myself in the background. And I have been listening for a long time.
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:04.160]  And about 15 years ago, if I could just quickly tell you this story, how I became awakened,
[01:04:05.120 --> 01:04:11.120]  I started taking red rice extract. And for four years, I brought my cholesterol number way down.
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:15.920]  And of course, that goes against the pharmaceutical company. So of course,
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:22.800]  the FDA pulled it from the market. So as soon as they did that, I was awakened to their scam.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:28.240]  Well, they certainly don't want you to have choices. I mean, that's what it's all about.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:32.800]  They tell you what to do, which is a form of slavery. They tell you how to think,
[01:04:32.800 --> 01:04:38.240]  where to live, who to be. They lay out four or five different versions of who you can be.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:44.880]  You can be a neocon, you can be a liberal, you can be a progressive, you can be a couch potato.
[01:04:44.880 --> 01:04:50.000]  Hey, how about I don't want to be any of those. How about I want to be free, informed, involved,
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:57.680]  aggressive, loving life. What is what does Ted Nugent say? Working hard, playing hard America.
[01:04:57.680 --> 01:05:04.880]  We'll be right back. A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why,
[01:05:04.880 --> 01:05:09.520]  even if I had a pretty good sized meal that I was still starving. And my research led me to a well
[01:05:09.520 --> 01:05:14.560]  known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:20.640]  industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:25.680]  elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer and be healthy.
[01:05:25.680 --> 01:05:31.840]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there and discovered Young Jevity.
[01:05:31.840 --> 01:05:36.640]  The Young Jevity products are designed to give you the real nutrition you need. And once you've
[01:05:36.640 --> 01:05:43.600]  got that, you don't have to eat as much to be satisfied. I've lost 37 pounds in two months,

[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:10.240]  for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse. The globalist model is to shut down
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:15.680]  societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover. That's why

[01:08:07.200 --> 01:08:13.200]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence,
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:19.600]  whether sought or unsought by the military industrial complex. In Dallas, Texas, three
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:25.600]  shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas. The first reports say that
[01:08:25.600 --> 01:08:33.840]  President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting. It is a big idea. A new world order.
[01:08:37.200 --> 01:08:41.920]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion. It just pancakes.
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:49.120]  Either you were with us or you were with the terrorists.
[01:09:01.120 --> 01:09:03.680]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that
[01:09:03.680 --> 01:09:06.960]  AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:19.440]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:24.000]  city. Global governance at last. Is it one world? The central bank is in charge,
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.520]  but are we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[01:09:27.520 --> 01:09:38.720]  Live from the infowars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:09:42.560 --> 01:09:47.760]  We are well into our number two today. Thank you so much for joining us. We're going to continue
[01:09:47.760 --> 01:09:54.800]  with open phones throughout this hour. Looking at Watergate 2.0, I mean, Benghazi, the IRS
[01:09:54.800 --> 01:10:02.240]  persecuting and spying and unconstitutionally demanding records of people that had attended
[01:10:02.240 --> 01:10:10.320]  Tea Party meetings as a secret police stomping around, getting in everybody's face. This is just
[01:10:10.320 --> 01:10:17.680]  some of what's going on right now and unfolding. This is just a small sampling.
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:22.720]  And I want to run through some of these headlines now and then go directly to your calls.
[01:10:22.720 --> 01:10:32.080]  800-259-9231 is the toll free number to join us. Let's look at some of these headlines right here.
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:39.680]  The White House says it had no idea the DOJ had seized AP phone records.
[01:10:41.600 --> 01:10:48.960]  Unbelievable. Mitch McConnell, the Senate leader, says that a lot more is coming. This is only the
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:56.160]  beginning. Government probe obtains wide swath of AP phone records, AP reporting on that, to track
[01:10:56.160 --> 01:11:02.240]  journalists talking to whistleblowers who are exposing criminal wrongdoing. Criminals at the
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:10.800]  Justice Department running defense for the White House. And the White House says they know nothing.
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:17.440]  I know nothing. You don't know that's from Hogan's Heroes, folks. Under sweeping subpoenas,
[01:11:17.440 --> 01:11:23.920]  the Justice Department obtained AP phone records in leaked investigation. Drudge comes out.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:29.920]  Matt Drudge says, warning to reporters and sources. Assume all your communications are
[01:11:29.920 --> 01:11:35.440]  being monitored. Time to move back to the parking garage. And I posted this on infowars.com,
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:39.040]  and people were like, what does he mean the parking garage? That's where Deep Throat
[01:11:39.040 --> 01:11:45.200]  would meet with Woodward and Bernstein. The parking garage, cuz it's noisy, and it doesn't
[01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:50.240]  tend to be bugged. And in the old days, the FBI had the NSA dialing into your phone, and it would
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:55.600]  just, you ever picked up your phone and it's like off the hook, but you put it on the hook,
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:11:59.600]  and it's just sitting there like somebody's on a line? That's the old way to tap your phone.
[01:12:00.560 --> 01:12:08.160]  Now that can happen naturally too, but rarely. So there you have that tweet. You can follow us,
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:13.520]  by the way, at Real Alex Jones. And you can follow Drudge, at Drudge, that's his personal
[01:12:13.520 --> 01:12:18.240]  Drudge, and he's got his Drudge report, one that's bigger. Okay, continuing, a White House
[01:12:18.240 --> 01:12:22.400]  response to the Justice Department, shakably attaining phone records. Again, we are not
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:28.160]  involved. As I just mentioned, liberals defend Obama for spying on the media,
[01:12:29.600 --> 01:12:33.440]  after years of attacking Bush for it, which was wrong, which we attacked him for.
[01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:37.360]  He got caught with some warrantless wiretapping, it was almost curtains.
[01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:45.840]  Now they're doing it to the media on a much wider scale, and the usual suspects of think progress,
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:52.080]  I mean, Soros, Obama, our excellent group, are saying, hey, we need to do this, it's no big deal.
[01:12:52.080 --> 01:13:00.000]  It's no big deal. So continuing here, Rand Paul says, AP phone spying proves Obama
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:03.600]  is drunk on power. I will play that at the bottom of the hour after we take some calls.
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:09.440]  And leaked documents shifting into IRS, IRS targeting conservatives in what media called
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:17.840]  conspiracy. And then we link back in this infowars.com article by Anthony
[01:13:17.840 --> 01:13:21.920]  Giuriardi, to where this was reported by the alternative media years ago. Continuing,
[01:13:21.920 --> 01:13:28.080]  IRS scrutiny went beyond Tea Party, targeting of conservative groups broader than thought.
[01:13:28.080 --> 01:13:34.560]  Fox News is reporting, and that's all in the Inspector General's own report. This is confirmed.
[01:13:34.560 --> 01:13:38.640]  Obama says he didn't know they need to look into it at the Justice Department.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:42.480]  They're the people doing this at the Justice Department.
[01:13:44.160 --> 01:13:51.200]  Continuing, Benghazi IRS, the son of Watergate, asked the Chicago Tribune. I know I'd say it's
[01:13:51.200 --> 01:13:58.400]  Watergate squared to the next power. George Will says, IRS scandal echoes of Watergate?
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:04.800]  It's a lot more than that. Same IRS that targeted conservatives will now demand your private health
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:14.960]  insurance records and your entire database of your prescriptions. The good old IRS of enemies list
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:21.680]  running that. IRS head Stephen Miller, mistakes were made. Hey, maybe I can go out and drive my
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:30.880]  Dodge Charger. The speedometer goes to 200. I haven't had it up to that.
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:35.680]  I won't say what I've had it up to, but it's pretty shameful that I would do something like
[01:14:35.680 --> 01:14:41.600]  that. Let's say the cops pull me over going 170 miles an hour. I'm going to the hospital.
[01:14:41.600 --> 01:14:48.560]  Let's say the cops pull me over going 170 miles an hour. 170 miles an hour, only once,
[01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:52.880]  I'm joking. I'm trying to act tough folks, I didn't do that. Anyway, I had brand new tires
[01:14:52.880 --> 01:15:01.360]  on. Anyway, it's awesome, the light bulbs are going. Kickstart my heart, man. I get high,
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:08.240]  I get high on speed. Top fuel funny cause a drug for me. My heart, my heart, kickstart my heart.
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:13.520]  Anyways, when the cops pull me over, I'll just say, officer, I don't want to be arrested for
[01:15:13.520 --> 01:15:18.560]  reckless driving. I was in control of the vehicle. This is an Autobahn style road here. They go 200
[01:15:18.560 --> 01:15:26.240]  on the Autobahn. Officer, I made a mistake. Well, then Alex, you can go free. It's not a mistake.
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:35.040]  It's all premeditated. IRS head Stephen Miller, mistakes were made. IRS officials in Washington
[01:15:35.040 --> 01:15:44.880]  were involved in targeting of conservative groups. Really? Again, this is from yesterday.
[01:15:44.880 --> 01:15:49.040]  That's the Washington Post, so now it's real. And we were saying it was a conspiracy theory, but
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:52.960]  senior tax officials knew of extra Tea Party scrutiny.
[01:15:54.480 --> 01:15:58.240]  Well, yeah, they got Democrats out defending it now. Well, of course we're targeting you bad
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:16:04.640]  people. Top IRS official didn't reveal Tea Party targeting and knew years ago. You've now been
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:09.680]  caught lying. You knew. Of course you knew. Of course you knew. You ordered it. IRS employees
[01:16:09.680 --> 01:16:16.400]  donated over twice as much to Obama in 2012. Well, yeah, so did Goldman Sachs. So you guys
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:20.640]  are big idiots, aren't you? All you people that work for the government think you're winners,
[01:16:21.600 --> 01:16:27.120]  losers. I mean, if you work for the government, that's one issue. But if you actually think
[01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:31.360]  you're on some winning team because you do and that you're against us, you're morons.
[01:16:31.360 --> 01:16:34.800]  Exclusive McConnell, IRS revelations just the beginning. Already mentioned that, but there's
[01:16:35.840 --> 01:16:42.160]  the Breitbart article on that with his quotes by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky
[01:16:43.120 --> 01:16:48.400]  revealed the 55 questions the IRS asked one Tea Party grip after more than two years of waiting,
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:55.520]  including demands for names of all its donors and volunteers. Secret Police University to bestow
[01:16:55.520 --> 01:17:02.320]  face of IRS scandal with with honorary tribute. The woman in charge of all this illegal activity
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:10.160]  is to be given an award, an award for American activities. Yes, the woman in charge of IRS
[01:17:10.160 --> 01:17:14.560]  division responsible for reviewing tax and ship status applications to harass.
[01:17:14.560 --> 01:17:18.640]  And it was the heart of the ongoing scandal over revelations of agency targeting conservatives,
[01:17:18.640 --> 01:17:24.640]  just like the head of. Environmental Protection Agency and all these other people get in trouble
[01:17:24.640 --> 01:17:28.160]  targeted conservative groups is set to receive an honorary tribute from Western New England
[01:17:28.160 --> 01:17:33.200]  University School of Law. Lois Lerner, director of the IRS Exemplary Organization Division,
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:38.320]  was slated to deliver the school's commencement address and be given the university's
[01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:44.400]  president's medallion. The president's medallion. Why don't we give Obama
[01:17:45.200 --> 01:17:51.360]  100 more peace prizes while we're at it? Start putting them in cracker jack boxes that would
[01:17:51.360 --> 01:17:56.480]  that that would give it actually more value than this. Let me get some other news and we're going
[01:17:56.480 --> 01:18:06.000]  to come back with. Joanne is smooth. It's a mood, Tony and Lynn and others in our phone systems got
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:09.920]  some phone lines down for some reason. They're going to reboot the phone system after I take
[01:18:09.920 --> 01:18:13.760]  these calls, so we'll reopen the phones after that. I'm gonna go to your calls after the break.
[01:18:14.480 --> 01:18:17.600]  Here is some news we already knew. This actually came out under Tony Blair,
[01:18:17.600 --> 01:18:22.880]  but it's in the Daily Mail today. Immigrants, we sent out search parties to get them to come
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:29.200]  and made it hard for Britains to get work, says Mandelson. Labor sent out, that's the
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:33.200]  communist in England, search parties for immigrants to get them to come to the UK.
[01:18:33.200 --> 01:18:38.080]  Lord Mandelson has admitted as part of a labor plan under Blair and continuing under Gordon Brown.
[01:18:39.280 --> 01:18:43.840]  What do you think our government does? They give welfare to illegals that citizens can't give.
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:51.680]  They give tuition to illegals, free tuition or in-state tuition citizens can't get. And they're
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:55.280]  above the law because they want to drive down the wages. They don't want to help the immigrants.
[01:18:56.880 --> 01:19:02.240]  They want to make us as poor as Ukraine or as poor as Mexico. Listen, I know how the universe
[01:19:02.240 --> 01:19:09.600]  works. I want Mexicans to be rich and prosperous with firearms and their kids healthy and not being
[01:19:09.600 --> 01:19:14.880]  used as a toxic waste dump ground. I want people in Nigeria to be successful and healthy.
[01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:20.480]  I want prosperity. They try to sell it that, you're not having hospitality if you don't want
[01:19:20.480 --> 01:19:26.960]  open borders. Mexico has collapsed. I'm talking about Mexico cuz it's 80% or more of the illegals.
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:33.200]  And now they're coming out in the Dream Act. He's already frozen most of the deportations.
[01:19:33.200 --> 01:19:39.840]  They're already, and it's like, isn't that sweet? Mexico dumps its criminals on the United States.
[01:19:39.840 --> 01:19:42.800]  Oh, you're fleeing from a murder down there? Just come here and kill people.
[01:19:43.760 --> 01:19:49.200]  And who do they mainly kill? Their own community. I was talking to an insider last night.
[01:19:50.320 --> 01:19:52.720]  They were telling me about how the Bandidos, and I already read this,
[01:19:53.520 --> 01:19:59.280]  have a state water left alone by the police. And I was told why as well. It's just amazing.

[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:38.240]  from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to
[01:20:38.240 --> 01:20:42.400]  service debt. This capitalism, or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the
[01:20:42.400 --> 01:20:45.920]  public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?

[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:10.800]  Some people think the answer is gold, others think it's a gun, but the correct answer will
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:17.360]  shock you. I just created a free video at Crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item
[01:23:17.360 --> 01:23:24.000]  that is more valuable than gold in a crisis. 97% of Americans don't have this one critical item.
[01:23:24.000 --> 01:23:28.800]  In fact, they haven't even given it a thought, and the sad truth is that you may not survive
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:33.600]  without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door.
[01:23:33.600 --> 01:23:37.120]  What I have to tell you could literally make the difference between life and death
[01:23:37.120 --> 01:23:42.960]  for you and your family. Watch my video at Crisis123.com to discover the number one
[01:23:42.960 --> 01:23:47.920]  most valuable item in a crisis. You'll be shocked. See the controversial video that
[01:23:47.920 --> 01:23:51.360]  thousands of other smart patriots have already seen in the last three months.
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:56.880]  Go watch my video now at Crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:23:56.880 --> 01:24:06.320]  Again, that's Crisis123.com.
[01:24:06.320 --> 01:24:11.680]  In 1814, we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississippi.
[01:24:11.680 --> 01:24:15.680]  We took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississippi.
[01:24:15.680 --> 01:24:20.000]  We took a little bacon and we took a little beans and we caught the bloody British in a town.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:30.000]  I'm gonna go to your phone calls finishing up the motorcycle gang story. Basically,
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:35.600]  real motorcycle clubs like Hell's Angels, Bandidos, things like that are really used as the
[01:24:35.600 --> 01:24:41.440]  go-between for groups like, say, the Vikings in Los Angeles or the police gang to go out and
[01:24:41.440 --> 01:24:47.200]  carry out criminal activity for them. And then they'll choose who they think is the nastiest,
[01:24:47.200 --> 01:24:51.440]  toughest motorcycle gang to then carry out their operations for them.
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:55.600]  That's what the CIA and others, go back to World War II, they used the Sicilian
[01:24:55.600 --> 01:25:01.680]  mafia and the first invasion for intelligence of Italy. And that's how it's always worked.
[01:25:02.720 --> 01:25:08.080]  But my example of that is a group like that then gets chosen to work with this power structure
[01:25:08.880 --> 01:25:13.920]  because it was particularly violent and aggressive to begin with. So then your family
[01:25:13.920 --> 01:25:17.680]  gets pulled over and you get given tickets and your car searched. But then if you're in the
[01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:23.200]  Bandidos or another outlaw motorcycle gang, then the police all leave you alone. But you and your
[01:25:23.200 --> 01:25:27.520]  family, the housewife gets pulled over, all her stuff thrown all over the place, taken to jail
[01:25:27.520 --> 01:25:31.840]  if she's had two beers. Now, what does that tell you about how to be free? I'm not saying go off
[01:25:31.840 --> 01:25:37.760]  and be like the Bandidos. You decriminalize the drugs to dry up that entire culture.
[01:25:37.760 --> 01:25:41.680]  But while that's going on, how are you gonna be treated laying down the government?
[01:25:41.680 --> 01:25:45.840]  How are you going to be treated acting like a coward? How are you going to be treated
[01:25:45.840 --> 01:25:52.640]  laying down to everybody? America became great because we didn't lie down and people were scared
[01:25:52.640 --> 01:26:00.000]  of us. Now we think the American flag is a man bent over with a government goblin behind him.
[01:26:00.000 --> 01:26:05.440]  And let me tell you, or a ostrich with its head stuck in the sand, or the TSA with its hand down
[01:26:05.440 --> 01:26:10.880]  to your wife's pants. That is an act of gang domination of you and your family. And we will
[01:26:10.880 --> 01:26:18.720]  become like Mexico very shortly, a dominated gang run culture if that continues. If good people
[01:26:18.720 --> 01:26:23.360]  don't get together and assert our rights over the corrupting government and everywhere else,
[01:26:23.360 --> 01:26:30.000]  we will all become slaves. And that's why when the cops pull me over and wanna search my car
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:33.840]  for drugs, I laugh at them. Number one, you're violating my Fourth Amendment. Number two,
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:37.600]  you're fishing for stuff. Number three, the government ships in and controls the drug trade.
[01:26:37.600 --> 01:26:41.920]  And don't say you don't know that cop. What are you giving me a problem for? I'm just doing my
[01:26:41.920 --> 01:26:47.680]  job. Doing your job, you work for a government that doesn't exist and is illegitimate. Is that
[01:26:47.680 --> 01:26:55.440]  clear? If they ever restore the republic, abolish the Federal Reserve, get due process back in,
[01:26:55.440 --> 01:26:59.680]  it'll be a legitimate government. Until that point, man, this thing is far gone.
[01:26:59.680 --> 01:27:03.840]  And the only way to restore the republic is to withdraw your consent from this
[01:27:03.840 --> 01:27:07.760]  and to stop recognizing it. The illegal aliens don't recognize the government.
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:14.720]  They're above the law because we have a criminal government. The only way now to be free is to just
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:21.520]  more and more I realize this is just none of it's real. It's all garbage. It's all garbage.
[01:27:22.560 --> 01:27:28.480]  And I'm sick of it. Let's go ahead and talk to Joanne in Arkansas. Joanne, you're on the
[01:27:28.480 --> 01:27:37.120]  air. Welcome. Hi, Alex. Finally. Nice to get dirty finally. Welcome. They should change the
[01:27:37.120 --> 01:27:42.880]  name of this from Watergate 2.0 to murder gate. I mean, that's essentially.
[01:27:42.880 --> 01:27:50.560]  Ben Godney murder gate. Oh my God. I'm sorry. Nobody died during Watergate.
[01:27:51.680 --> 01:27:57.440]  So they're making it seem like, oh, it's just this little bit of Watergate going on.
[01:27:57.440 --> 01:28:06.000]  No, it's a murder. You're absolutely right. And the puppets are going to be
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:11.200]  taken out, but I'm sure they're not going to go behind the curtain yet.
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:15.600]  Well, the only reason the system's upset is because you made men. That's what they are
[01:28:15.600 --> 01:28:19.360]  in the State Department. That's over the whole thing over the CIA. You name it.
[01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:23.440]  Made men were killed. And that's why the system is so upset, too. It's like,
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:28.080]  why did you kill our own people? Just cover up the missiles you gave Al Qaeda. I mean,
[01:28:28.080 --> 01:28:33.120]  it's so lawless now that our government publicly runs Al Qaeda while weird pot
[01:28:33.120 --> 01:28:38.800]  bellies grope our wives and children looking for bombs. Do you see what I'm saying?
[01:28:39.600 --> 01:28:48.560]  Oh, absolutely. And they will look over this and then say, oh, OK, they killed those people,
[01:28:48.560 --> 01:28:53.680]  but they didn't kill the people in Boston. They didn't kill people on 9-11. They would never do
[01:28:53.680 --> 01:29:00.320]  that. I mean, why would they? If they would kill these people, why wouldn't they kill these?
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:06.720]  They estimate the numbers of dead Syrians to be astronomical over 50000 when you look up
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:11.200]  number of dead in three years or two and a half year Syria conflict. No one knows the exact
[01:29:11.200 --> 01:29:16.320]  numbers. Our government is funding that against civilians. I mean, they're blowing up houses.
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:20.720]  They're there. They've got a guy, one of the rebel commanders eating a heart
[01:29:21.600 --> 01:29:26.000]  saying, I'm going to kill all the Alawite Muslims, which is a minority Muslim group
[01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:30.880]  that's peaceful. You've got an Al Qaeda guy from Saudi Arabia eating a heart on TV.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:36.800]  I'm not saying I'm coming to kill you, but it doesn't work on the Syrians. They don't
[01:29:36.800 --> 01:29:41.200]  get in a fetal position. They are fighting back and taking their cities back. Al Qaeda thinks
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:45.280]  it's intimidating. Americans are something that roll over and urinate all over themselves.
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:48.960]  It's not what's happening. They're fighting Hezbollah. Hezbollah is defeating them.
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:56.800]  We're on the march. The Empire's on the run. Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:33:54.720 --> 01:34:02.000]  U.S. and U.K. pledge to bolster opposition so it intensify. Al-Qaeda murdering and eating people's
[01:34:02.000 --> 01:34:07.040]  hearts on TV. Literally there's video of this on info wars.com. BBC is covering it. It's real.
[01:34:07.040 --> 01:34:11.200]  And one of the opposition leaders eating hearts saying I'm going to kill everybody when I take
[01:34:11.200 --> 01:34:17.680]  over is totally out of their minds and getting defeated by the way. Getting defeated by Iranian
[01:34:17.680 --> 01:34:23.680]  Hezbollah that's been brought into the country. Our government saying they're going to intensify
[01:34:23.680 --> 01:34:28.080]  the support of them. Of course the ambassador is not going to tell you about the missiles because
[01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:32.960]  well you know what happened to him in Libya. So we're not going to show the video of them eating
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:39.120]  the heart if you want to see if it's up on info wars.com. I've got some breaking gun news that
[01:34:39.120 --> 01:34:45.600]  we'll cover at the start of the next segment. I have some breaking news where legislators
[01:34:46.400 --> 01:34:51.920]  have been caught in a hot mic that they didn't turn off about after they register they're going
[01:34:51.920 --> 01:34:57.600]  to confiscate. Mayor protein here in Austin Mike Martinez just says we're going to register and
[01:34:57.600 --> 01:35:02.000]  then take all your guns and then laughs at people. I mean it's yeah we're going to register and take
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:09.520]  your guns. Of course I'm not giving mine up slave. By the way the awesome police chief was in here
[01:35:09.520 --> 01:35:14.640]  and we've been too busy to get around to showing this and he said oh your guy at the gun rally who
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:21.520]  wasn't our guy you know he cussed at Mike Martinez to get him to say that it was their guy cussing
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:26.800]  and we have it in high def with the audio showing it. I'm going to show the police chief saying that
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:31.200]  and then I'm going to cut to the anti-gun saying it and the police chief then telling me I was
[01:35:31.200 --> 01:35:38.800]  wrong on air and smiling playing little tricks. I mean maybe he's wrong maybe slick Ardey Cevita
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:46.240]  is wrong but next time he's in I'll have that piece for him. I'm just reminding the reporters
[01:35:46.240 --> 01:35:49.360]  back there to go back to the last interview and then show that because that's the type of games
[01:35:49.360 --> 01:35:57.040]  they play. Speaking of games Obama is running around persecuting people and spying on people
[01:35:57.040 --> 01:36:04.560]  and spying without warrants and going after tea party groups and lying about Benghazi and it's
[01:36:04.560 --> 01:36:10.000]  really waking people up that wow he did lie to us. I thought he was a really sweet liberal doing the
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:17.360]  best job he could do because of the Republicans. You know the Republicans are so bad Obama has to
[01:36:17.360 --> 01:36:22.800]  do this and then when Republicans get in it'll be the Democrats are so bad we've got to let the
[01:36:22.800 --> 01:36:27.920]  Republicans violate our rights because you know if we don't then the Democrats will get in. How
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:33.040]  about we get constitutionalist in? How about we get rid of Republicans that don't act like Ted
[01:36:33.040 --> 01:36:40.000]  Cruz and Rand Paul? How's that sound? Speaking of Rand Paul here's an excerpt of the full article
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:50.000]  up on Infowars.com where Rand Paul says that Obama is becoming drunk on power. Lincoln said he says
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.600]  you know nearly any man can be tested and maybe meet up to adversity but if you really want to
[01:36:55.600 --> 01:37:01.600]  test a man give him power. I think in that sense the president's failing that test of power because
[01:37:01.600 --> 01:37:06.080]  he has extraordinary power and he's supposed to be able to be wise enough to restrain himself
[01:37:06.080 --> 01:37:10.880]  but he's using the power of government to investigate his enemies. He's tapping the phones
[01:37:10.880 --> 01:37:17.520]  of the press and it turns out last year he signed legislation that allows him to detain an American
[01:37:17.520 --> 01:37:22.560]  without a trial and send them to Guantanamo Bay. This sounds like a president somewhat drunk on
[01:37:22.560 --> 01:37:28.960]  power not cautious about how he uses power. All right drunk on power and and good job Rand
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:35.520]  bringing up NDAA and again I've learned Obama's tactics they're not hard. His White House lawyers
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:40.560]  justice department the criminal department they write the NDAA to secretly disappear some of the
[01:37:40.560 --> 01:37:44.720]  night. The media then lies and says it doesn't say that the constitutional lawyers look at it
[01:37:44.720 --> 01:37:51.440]  no it does. Then Obama comes out and criticizes it says it does I will veto it then it comes out
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:57.200]  he wrote it then I say folks the veto threat is to kill opposition. This is elementary everybody's
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:38:01.600]  like Alex he's gonna veto it and then he signs it on new year's eve two years ago
[01:38:03.360 --> 01:38:06.480]  at like six o'clock at night when nobody's paying attention.
[01:38:07.360 --> 01:38:13.280]  Was it like a Saturday night and then I still have debates with people Obama's not persecuting
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:19.680]  whistleblowers Obama's not going after the guns nobody wants your guns Alex Piers Morgan no one
[01:38:19.680 --> 01:38:24.320]  wants to take your guns really I'm in a city where you took all the guns everywhere you crooks are in
[01:38:24.320 --> 01:38:29.920]  control you take the guns you usurper over here trying to take my bill of rights the constitution
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:34.960]  by the way Piers Morgan's a crook he was over multiple newspapers planning fake news stories
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:41.120]  and and as clearly they've had courts rule was deceptive and his underlings have all gone to jail
[01:38:41.120 --> 01:38:46.720]  for illegal phone hacking but when I say he's a crook I say he's a crook because he's over here
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:52.800]  in my country trying to overthrow my bill of rights and make me a slave that's beyond being
[01:38:52.800 --> 01:38:58.880]  a crook he's an enemy operative but hey he's already dying politically have you seen the
[01:38:58.880 --> 01:39:06.320]  graph we showed it yesterday he was a million viewers a year ago 600,000 six months ago
[01:39:06.320 --> 01:39:14.640]  500,000 a month ago 400,000 now at current rates he will have 200,000 maybe 300,000 viewers in six
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:23.840]  months a year I mean what a joke what a legend in his own mind and again I harp on this because
[01:39:24.400 --> 01:39:31.680]  these people look at who the establishment thought we would want some hatchet man insider trading
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:43.120]  manipulator full of fake elitism and snobbery that's what CNN execs that's what they think
[01:39:43.120 --> 01:39:49.440]  is going to win that's what they think America wants is some red coat lecturing down to us when
[01:39:49.440 --> 01:39:54.480]  the brits hate his guts by the way nothing against brits when I say red coat a red coat is a imperial
[01:39:54.480 --> 01:40:02.080]  soldier in the service of tyranny I call our own corrupt government red coats people are trying to
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:07.920]  make it an anti-america anti-england deal the ideas in our revolution came out of magna carta
[01:40:07.920 --> 01:40:12.720]  and the parliament first voted to recognize the colonies and then the king of england came in and
[01:40:12.720 --> 01:40:18.160]  threatened a bunch of stuff and gave a speech to parliament and they still narrowly got the votes
[01:40:18.160 --> 01:40:29.760]  the votes for the war and so my whole issue is everyone needs to reject red coatism everywhere
[01:40:30.800 --> 01:40:37.760]  and and I mean if piers morgan isn't a red coat scumbag nobody is uh let's talk to lynn in georgia
[01:40:37.760 --> 01:40:46.960]  thanks for holding her on the air hello hey lynn hey um you may have already covered this but
[01:40:46.960 --> 01:40:58.000]  ever since the associated press information came out um I had to ask the question hold on a sec
[01:40:59.200 --> 01:41:04.400]  I don't know how to turn that off it's all right ma'am it adds a nice ambiance go ahead make your
[01:41:04.400 --> 01:41:12.720]  point okay ever since that came out I remember that thing about the earlier um secret press
[01:41:12.720 --> 01:41:19.120]  conference right before the real press conference where the president selected certain associated
[01:41:19.120 --> 01:41:26.720]  press reporters to have this little closed door session I'm thinking that's where he gave them
[01:41:26.720 --> 01:41:33.040]  the heads up that they were getting ready to come out with this it's nothing new that I mean we they
[01:41:33.040 --> 01:41:38.400]  had already told everybody that they've been recording everybody's phone calls and emails
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:43.200]  it's totally illegal and again they just hide the criminality in plain view like tsa grubbing
[01:41:43.200 --> 01:41:49.200]  your family totally illegal a pro associated press be exempt maybe they thought they were
[01:41:49.200 --> 01:41:53.200]  maybe they got surprised when they found out that they were being recorded too well ma'am here's the
[01:41:53.200 --> 01:41:58.160]  critical juncture we've come to if we just accept they're doing this now that everybody seems to be
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:02.880]  upset about it just because something's been going on for a long time and then people finally get
[01:42:02.880 --> 01:42:07.280]  upset we can't be like well you idiots you know why didn't you listen to us we've got to say good
[01:42:07.280 --> 01:42:12.960]  job now here's the other stuff because people have to have that awakening moment just because we were
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:18.480]  awake before others doesn't mean now that we can't ever turn this around and I'm not even saying
[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:24.640]  they'll end up being destroyed because of this it's a process but they're trying to discredit
[01:42:24.640 --> 01:42:29.360]  the liberty movement they're trying to get the public behind their gun control program because
[01:42:29.360 --> 01:42:36.080]  they need people power we need people power and we are for the people we are for a new enlightenment
[01:42:36.080 --> 01:42:46.000]  a new renaissance a a rediscovery of individualism and so we are in a continued war and yes I
[01:42:46.000 --> 01:42:50.080]  understand being you know upset or cynical and going this has always been going on the last 20
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:54.960]  30 years they would just deny it before now they've been throwing it in our face but they're
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:43:01.520]  failing the throwing it in the face has caused a backlash and so we need to now push that backlash
[01:43:01.520 --> 01:43:06.400]  over the edge into a tipping point let me tell you something the reason they're getting armored
[01:43:06.400 --> 01:43:10.800]  vehicles and billions of bullets and training to do lockdown stuff and take over the communications
[01:43:10.800 --> 01:43:16.480]  and internet kill switches is because they're weak they have engaged in all this bravada
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:24.880]  to put on a show of strength because they're really afraid okay and so I'm telling you this
[01:43:24.880 --> 01:43:30.160]  is real they're in trouble and more is going to come and we need the republican leadership
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:34.240]  will will try to contain this because they don't want to break through the firewalls into them
[01:43:34.240 --> 01:43:38.960]  I say let the whole thing run its course I say abolish the fellow reserve that's the real people
[01:43:38.960 --> 01:43:45.520]  behind all this bring back the republic and and and again if we believe it and just persevere
[01:43:45.520 --> 01:43:51.040]  we don't have to win individual battles we can lose every battle and win the war like George
[01:43:51.040 --> 01:43:56.880]  Washington he lost every battle for like three years okay and then only had a few symbolic
[01:43:56.880 --> 01:44:04.160]  victories we're actually having victories all the time and I mean I mean you've got me getting off
[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:10.160]  into strategy and things what exactly are you getting at here I'm getting at talking about
[01:44:10.160 --> 01:44:15.520]  winning hearts and minds for the resistance yesterday I went back and looked at some old
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:22.640]  movies and I had not seen brainwashing 101 and I just want to say that if my problem with
[01:44:22.640 --> 01:44:27.040]  communicating with another generation has been you know they've been they've been raised on
[01:44:27.040 --> 01:44:34.320]  Marxism and they don't understand what we're saying so college-age students in that video
[01:44:35.360 --> 01:44:45.280]  were so civil and level-headed and clear thinking and straightforward it I was so impressed I was
[01:44:45.280 --> 01:44:50.640]  encouraged number one but I just want to put a plug in for that video if anybody's having trouble
[01:44:50.640 --> 01:44:56.240]  communicating with the younger generation that one will do it it's called brainwashing 101
[01:44:56.880 --> 01:45:02.880]  uh-huh and it talks about these students who were prosecuted persecuted by the administration of
[01:45:02.880 --> 01:45:09.520]  their colleges because they're putting up flyers for a conservative club meeting event on the
[01:45:09.520 --> 01:45:15.440]  college campus that yeah that's from 2011 I've seen that video listen ma'am I appreciate your
[01:45:15.440 --> 01:45:20.080]  points let me tell you why it's hard to wake up some of the young people they've been brought
[01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:26.080]  up on television video games and now iPads and iPods and and and all this stuff and they're not
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:35.360]  the language is shrinking they're not communicating with people and they don't feel empowered they
[01:45:35.360 --> 01:45:40.720]  feel scared they feel like acting trendy will make them successful then they wonder why there's no
[01:45:40.720 --> 01:45:45.840]  jobs and why they're not successful so the system says be a slacker you know just get into your you
[01:45:45.840 --> 01:45:50.480]  know the fact that you're a failure the way you reach out to them is saying look you're part of
[01:45:50.480 --> 01:45:55.520]  history you have a destiny there's a war going on you've been lied to and you've got to grab
[01:45:55.520 --> 01:46:01.840]  them by the shoulders and say you've got to realize that there's a future and that you're
[01:46:01.840 --> 01:46:07.360]  part of it and that there's a historical war going on and things are actually incredibly interesting
[01:46:09.840 --> 01:46:11.520]  we've got to give them a
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:16.640]  idea of the power that they have
[01:46:21.200 --> 01:46:24.400]  they just put Carney up on screen from the communist news network
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:32.160]  white house says that they need balance on probes says we must weigh freedom versus national
[01:46:32.160 --> 01:46:40.720]  security you've got to be kidding so so exactly okay we're spying on you but freedom versus
[01:46:40.720 --> 01:46:45.840]  national security i thought our national security is our freedom oh you saw the bombing in boston
[01:46:45.840 --> 01:46:53.360]  now we got to have tsa on the streets see how they're just doubling down like con artist
[01:46:55.840 --> 01:47:02.720]  i mean unbelievable unbelievable let's go to tony in pennsylvania go ahead tony
[01:47:03.920 --> 01:47:09.040]  like how you're doing today good brother hey i just wanted to make two points quick and then
[01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:17.200]  ask you a quick question uh first off have you ever seen the tv show burn notice no okay it's
[01:47:17.200 --> 01:47:22.480]  based on a spy who gets burned i think basically since i'm not sure if you said obama was cia
[01:47:23.200 --> 01:47:28.800]  maybe they're going to burn him and try and give him an act of redemption where he's going to have
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:34.000]  to try and pull off something big to basically recover his name within the upper echelons
[01:47:34.000 --> 01:47:41.680]  yeah no obama was cia came from a double-sided cia uh active duty family on record but he's
[01:47:41.680 --> 01:47:47.680]  above cia he is a foundation carnegie ford rockefeller foundation the whole family
[01:47:47.680 --> 01:47:55.680]  is is is above government criminal network uh group nice and i agree with you 100 uh my next
[01:47:55.680 --> 01:47:59.920]  question would be i'll just skip my second point no go ahead go ahead you can do them all brother
[01:47:59.920 --> 01:48:06.400]  my second question was uh i sent you a thing about a game called home front a little while
[01:48:06.400 --> 01:48:11.600]  back and basically it's where korea was unified and invaded the us now you couple that with
[01:48:12.400 --> 01:48:18.560]  uh call of duty bottom warfare one two and three uh basically the united states gets invaded and
[01:48:18.560 --> 01:48:23.600]  basically i think they're trying to condition people to that through martial law and also when
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:30.000]  they bring in the blue helmets for the civil unrest well it's officially in the washington
[01:48:30.000 --> 01:48:34.560]  post that they've got deals to bring in foreign un troops during civil emergency it won't be a
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:40.880]  foreign occupation it'll be our friends here helping us and there's no doubt they're training
[01:48:40.880 --> 01:48:46.240]  for a war with real americans uh and they're committed to their program and and there is a
[01:48:46.240 --> 01:48:53.520]  war back against them within the system believe me i have talked to high level active duty secret
[01:48:53.520 --> 01:48:59.920]  service via somebody else's telephone i'll just leave it at that okay i mean this is confirmed
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:08.480]  and and they said over 90 of the secret service absolutely hate obama uh and the stuff they see
[01:49:08.480 --> 01:49:13.040]  going on is why they hate them i mean they say you know it is uh there's a reason they're scared
[01:49:13.040 --> 01:49:18.080]  of leaks and i wasn't told anything i was just told almost everybody hates them they know the
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:21.760]  new world order is real and they're all listening so i shouldn't make fun of the secret service so
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:27.440]  much i mean look at bonjino who quit he was a good guy we've had him on i i tend to bash the system
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:32.960]  so much look it's compartmentalized it's a bunch of crooks running rough shot i mean you saw the
[01:49:32.960 --> 01:49:38.000]  atf emails and the video where they go do as you're told if you see what you believe is
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:44.080]  corruption you can only report it to your superior no one else no other agency do what you're told
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:50.240]  and be obedient so imagine being people in the government just having to sit there and watch all
[01:49:50.240 --> 01:49:56.400]  this crime go on i mean does that answer your question or what is your question exactly getting
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:01.280]  it well basically you brought up that with the secret service if they know that he's uh
[01:50:01.280 --> 01:50:06.400]  committing these crimes why don't they just arrest him because because that's because that's not how
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:11.040]  it works i mean as a cop or a federal officer you've got to have a grand jury in indictment
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:16.000]  or you've got to have clear and present danger where the guys you know if obama you know they
[01:50:16.000 --> 01:50:21.200]  came in and obama was you know killing children they could arrest him but then no one would
[01:50:21.200 --> 01:50:26.000]  believe them the president would say i'm the president he was killing the children and people
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:31.040]  would believe it that's why you've got to discredit them to bring them down that's why attacking them
[01:50:31.040 --> 01:50:37.840]  is important it's it's it's these wars aren't like flip flip one way or the other it's it's it's
[01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:44.160]  a war it goes on and on on and on and on we we push back this evil this time it's like fencing
[01:50:44.160 --> 01:50:49.120]  it's gonna then regroup and come back at us and on and on on and on and on it's heaven and hell

[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:17.680]  okay his house of cards is going to fall because he's being exposed by his own minions
[02:01:19.120 --> 02:01:23.760]  i've actually done some work in attempting to expose it myself because i right when i
[02:01:23.760 --> 02:01:29.280]  right when this story aired and i was sitting in a in a one of metro mobility's cars going to work
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:35.360]  i thought something was funny about it being that i've lived in the system myself and i've seen
[02:01:35.360 --> 02:01:41.120]  people i've seen people with disabilities get provocateur'd into doing stuff and i've seen that
[02:01:41.120 --> 02:01:45.280]  kind of stuff go on on a small scale i mean it goes on on a large scale you just go up the
[02:01:45.280 --> 02:01:50.960]  fibonacci sequence so right when i heard about this supposed youtube video setting off the muslims
[02:01:50.960 --> 02:01:56.080]  oh my that can't be it well they've been caught lying about it all and i just think their lies
[02:01:56.080 --> 02:02:00.640]  have gotten too big and he's outlived his usefulness to the globalist will probably
[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:05.840]  um at least politically damage him to a certain degree i mean not even staging another shooting
[02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:11.760]  that's not even going to save the uh the goblin queen i actually i think he's the goblin queen
[02:02:11.760 --> 02:02:18.160]  and big sis is the goblin king now i figured it out thank you sir let's talk to nathan in kansas
[02:02:18.720 --> 02:02:23.600]  i guess we are in kansas i want to talk about uh the obama meltdown gate go ahead
[02:02:24.640 --> 02:02:28.720]  uh yeah uh hey thanks for having me on and it's great talking to you it's great talking to you
[02:02:28.720 --> 02:02:32.400]  brother listen we don't have call screeners you don't thank me for getting you on i appreciate
[02:02:32.400 --> 02:02:41.920]  you calling go ahead absolutely uh well basically um a week ago i went to the dmv to uh register my
[02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:48.400]  my truck a truck that i bought back in 2005 that i'm still paying enough property tax on um i spoke
[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:55.360]  with the uh the guard about the gun debate and being from kansas uh you know brownback and uh
[02:02:55.360 --> 02:03:01.200]  the the state legislatures actually um did a really cool thing and uh they actually are trying
[02:03:01.200 --> 02:03:05.600]  to protect our gun rights yeah and uh and the crook and chief over at the justice department
[02:03:05.600 --> 02:03:11.680]  says he's going to come against the state yes well so i asked him i you know i mean here here he is
[02:03:11.680 --> 02:03:17.120]  he's a law enforcement officer pretty cool guy um i asked him you know what do you think about that
[02:03:17.680 --> 02:03:22.880]  and he basically said that he thought it was mostly grandstanding you know he said not so
[02:03:22.880 --> 02:03:28.720]  much from brownback but possibly from kobok or koback yeah but at least they are grandstanding
[02:03:28.720 --> 02:03:33.600]  by saying we're going to nullify your stuff they've nullified and let the illegal aliens
[02:03:33.600 --> 02:03:38.160]  run around that's illegal well this is constitutional to have the state say we're
[02:03:38.160 --> 02:03:42.880]  not enforcing them you know stuff that's uh violates the bill of rights let me tell you
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:49.920]  what gives orders in this world is the will to say no what does tony montana say okay i got two things
[02:03:49.920 --> 02:03:55.680]  in this world my word and my huevos and i don't break them for no one and and look it just comes
[02:03:55.680 --> 02:04:02.320]  down to that people think groveling gets them ahead that is a lie and so i salute what your
[02:04:02.320 --> 02:04:07.120]  state's doing i don't i don't think it's uh i don't think it's just ceremonial because the whole
[02:04:07.120 --> 02:04:12.400]  world is a stage and each of us players upon it i mean as bill hicks i know that better than most
[02:04:13.840 --> 02:04:19.520]  well i mean sarcastic and i agree but today i actually called and i've called many times
[02:04:19.520 --> 02:04:26.400]  to my state representative uh um kevin yoder and now his uh the guy who answers the phone uh told
[02:04:26.400 --> 02:04:30.880]  me i said hey what are we going to do you know obviously we're leaving we kind of leading the
[02:04:30.880 --> 02:04:37.120]  united states on gun rights at least you know can we at least get something going uh as far as uh
[02:04:37.120 --> 02:04:41.600]  you know getting obama impeached or or the people that are in office that are totally trampling on
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:47.280]  the constitution can we do something about this he flat out said it'll never happen and i'm like
[02:04:47.280 --> 02:04:51.200]  come on man you know i said there has to be something and he goes well you know we'll just

[02:09:13.040 --> 02:09:20.320]  enchilada uh just amazing that that's going on also dr kermit goslin was found guilty of murdering
[02:09:20.320 --> 02:09:25.040]  infants in late-term abortions a philadelphia doctor that the media tried to basically cover
[02:09:25.040 --> 02:09:30.960]  up the trial was found guilty to yesterday afternoon of murdering three babies born alive
[02:09:30.960 --> 02:09:36.640]  in an abortion clinic fox news confirms he was acquitted in the fourth baby's death and they
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:41.680]  found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the overdose death of an adult patient that's what
[02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:46.720]  triggered this whole thing and they go into what a grisly house of horrors it was and how filthy it
[02:09:46.720 --> 02:09:50.720]  was and that's what convinced the jury that it was really bad it was i guess it would have been
[02:09:50.720 --> 02:09:56.400]  i guess it would have been clean it would have been okay like dr mingola's lab dr kermit goslin
[02:09:56.400 --> 02:10:02.000]  72 was convicted of first-degree murder and could face execution in the deaths of three babies who
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:07.680]  authorities say were delivered alive and then killed with scissors uh at a grimy clinic in a
[02:10:07.680 --> 02:10:12.160]  case that has become a flashpoint in the nation's debate over abortion regardless of what you think
[02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:16.480]  of abortion folks in the first trimester or whatever come on man these are like eight and
[02:10:16.480 --> 02:10:20.880]  nine month old babies that could be adopted and then planned parent it always goes nobody wants
[02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:26.080]  the brown babies that's like the catch-all really there's more people wanting to adopt each year
[02:10:26.080 --> 02:10:31.920]  look it up than there are abortions that's why the united states gets korean and chinese and and
[02:10:31.920 --> 02:10:37.200]  african babies and then and russian babies and then now those countries are clamping down on
[02:10:37.200 --> 02:10:42.240]  exporting people are infertile they want kids people love children they want to raise them up
[02:10:42.240 --> 02:10:48.880]  and they've got groups trying to keep black babies from being adopted by hispanics or whites or vice
[02:10:48.880 --> 02:10:53.920]  versa or blacks can't adopt whites and it's the globalist trying to make sure those babies die
[02:10:55.360 --> 02:10:58.560]  and uh pretty amazing now one more piece of breaking news then we're going to go
[02:10:59.600 --> 02:11:07.120]  uh to our guest this is up at info awards.com oops hot mic reveals lawmakers
[02:11:07.120 --> 02:11:15.120]  uh intent to confiscate guns and this is in uh new jersey
[02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:20.960]  and i can clearly hear it with headphones on out there in the control room i don't know if
[02:11:20.960 --> 02:11:24.560]  in radio land if you're listening on am or shortwave on satellite you'll probably be
[02:11:24.560 --> 02:11:29.840]  able to hear it but you can clear and by tonight's news i want to soup up the audio
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:35.280]  we can put this on and you know the part where it's low turn it up they'll say alter the video
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:40.560]  oh no just just turn it up but this is this is this has not been um augmented or souped up it
[02:11:40.560 --> 02:11:44.880]  needs to be you can hear them ending as they classically do on c-spam well this was recorded
[02:11:44.880 --> 02:11:52.720]  in new jersey and then you know the leader of the senate and then his two adjuncts say yeah okay
[02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:56.720]  we're going to come back and then we'll get the bill passed to confiscate their guns and then
[02:11:56.720 --> 02:12:03.280]  you hear you hear someone cackle it's like mike martinez mayor proteum at the gun grabber march
[02:12:03.280 --> 02:12:07.840]  you know he's like we're gonna first register your guns and then we're gonna ban them everybody

[02:12:23.360 --> 02:12:31.200]  and then you want my guns punk ain't gonna happen and that's what they hate is us saying it's 1776
[02:12:31.200 --> 02:12:40.320]  we're not doing it don't cross this line do you want to take a life do you want to cross that line
[02:12:41.600 --> 02:12:45.600]  because it's a long way back from hell
[02:12:48.240 --> 02:12:52.720]  and by taking a life you want to take the life of our republic do you want to kill the spirit of
[02:12:52.720 --> 02:13:04.640]  our country because that's what we're trying to do is kill liberty right now let's go ahead and
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:12.880]  go to the audio of this we made some bills better i know we couldn't make everybody happy but we
[02:13:12.880 --> 02:13:19.520]  did what we could to at least improve the process thank you we will see everybody back on the budget
[02:13:19.520 --> 02:13:30.080]  cycle next week
[02:13:30.080 --> 02:13:40.400]  so
[02:13:40.400 --> 02:13:55.840]  All they want to do is to have their little guns and do what they want with them.
[02:13:55.840 --> 02:13:58.160]  All they want to do is keep their little guns.
[02:13:58.160 --> 02:14:01.320]  Well, we're going to confiscate.
[02:14:01.320 --> 02:14:02.320]  That's right.
[02:14:02.320 --> 02:14:05.080]  We're going to get your gun yet, Mac.
[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:09.520]  And you know, by the way, I got on guards protecting me.
[02:14:09.520 --> 02:14:12.400]  And you better know I own guns.
[02:14:12.400 --> 02:14:18.560]  It's come out that Chuck Schumer, Feinstein, Michael Moore, all of them, they gots the
[02:14:18.560 --> 02:14:19.560]  guns.
[02:14:19.560 --> 02:14:23.080]  But you, the little people, you ain't going to need those no more, because you know, all
[02:14:23.080 --> 02:14:26.000]  once we got the guns, political power grows out of the barrel.
[02:14:26.000 --> 02:14:29.300]  You know how much we like Mao Zedong, and that's what he said.
[02:14:29.300 --> 02:14:31.280]  We learned a lot from Chairman Mao.
[02:14:31.280 --> 02:14:38.040]  All right, boy, I can hear it really clear, actually, in my earpiece.
[02:14:38.040 --> 02:14:42.000]  And there's a transcript of it, it's up on infowars.com, with a nice little graphic.
[02:14:42.000 --> 02:14:43.000]  Can we punch this up?
[02:14:43.000 --> 02:14:47.320]  We took an actual Soviet poster of citizens hand over your weapons and translated it into
[02:14:47.320 --> 02:14:53.120]  English and added Obama's head to it.
[02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:54.120]  You got to love it.
[02:14:54.120 --> 02:15:00.120]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, let us now go to Jeffrey Smith, a best-selling author that
[02:15:00.120 --> 02:15:03.800]  a lot of scientists on that he's recommended, really just a great researcher.
[02:15:03.800 --> 02:15:05.920]  He is the director of the Institute for Responsible Technology.
[02:15:05.920 --> 02:15:06.920]  That sounds extremist.
[02:15:06.920 --> 02:15:12.120]  And as one of the world's leading advocates against GM foods, his book, Seeds of Deception,
[02:15:12.120 --> 02:15:16.060]  all of it sold at infowarsstore.com, I would add, as an evil capitalist, is rated the number
[02:15:16.060 --> 02:15:22.120]  one book on the subject, and has been a substantial influence on public perception and even legislation
[02:15:22.120 --> 02:15:23.120]  worldwide.
[02:15:23.120 --> 02:15:26.320]  Smith has reached tens of millions of people through hundreds of media interviews.
[02:15:26.320 --> 02:15:28.240]  That'd be more than that.
[02:15:28.240 --> 02:15:32.360]  He produced the video Hidden Dangers in Kids' Meals, and also writes a popular monthly syndicate
[02:15:32.360 --> 02:15:33.360]  column.
[02:15:33.360 --> 02:15:36.280]  He is the genetic engineering committee of the Sierra Club.
[02:15:36.280 --> 02:15:38.840]  I don't like a lot of what they do, but I like that part.
[02:15:38.840 --> 02:15:44.960]  He is the former vice president of marketing for GMO detection laboratory and ran for the
[02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:45.960]  US Congress.
[02:15:45.960 --> 02:15:47.920]  And he's from his home state in Iowa.
[02:15:47.920 --> 02:15:50.720]  We've gone and interviewed him there, beautiful corn country.
[02:15:50.720 --> 02:15:52.720]  Responsibletechnology.org is the site.
[02:15:52.720 --> 02:15:56.220]  And folks, we've got the science, we've got the studies, rats.
[02:15:56.220 --> 02:15:57.220]  It fed this stuff.
[02:15:57.220 --> 02:15:58.220]  They grow big fat tumors.
[02:15:58.220 --> 02:16:00.220]  Honey bees eat it, they die.
[02:16:00.220 --> 02:16:02.100]  It runs from bad to worse.
[02:16:02.100 --> 02:16:06.520]  I remember that Washington Post article last year, we covered a bunch, where it said, farmers
[02:16:06.520 --> 02:16:09.120]  caught not following GM regulations.
[02:16:09.120 --> 02:16:13.880]  And in the article, maybe pull that up, there needs to be more enforcement on farmers.
[02:16:13.880 --> 02:16:19.840]  And it said, they're not planning the refuges for the bees of the non-GMO corn.
[02:16:19.840 --> 02:16:23.060]  So the bees are going and getting the pollen from the BT corn that has its own pesticide
[02:16:23.060 --> 02:16:24.060]  and dying.
[02:16:24.060 --> 02:16:28.560]  So see the, the poor bees are having to eat what we're fed, they're dying.
[02:16:28.560 --> 02:16:33.620]  So joining us is Jeffrey Smith, there's big move, big Supreme Court ruling.
[02:16:33.620 --> 02:16:35.640]  Big defeat, of course, they own the courts.
[02:16:35.640 --> 02:16:37.600]  Globally, a lot of victories.
[02:16:37.600 --> 02:16:39.160]  What is the latest?
[02:16:39.160 --> 02:16:42.760]  We take you now to, I guess, are you in Iowa right now, Jeffrey?
[02:16:42.760 --> 02:16:46.600]  Today I'm in California, tomorrow in Connecticut, next week in Iowa.
[02:16:46.600 --> 02:16:50.040]  All right, my friend, well, your Skype looks like you're in the room with us.
[02:16:50.040 --> 02:16:54.240]  Tell us what's happening in the war, the war for being able to label them.
[02:16:54.240 --> 02:16:58.120]  And even if somebody thinks GMO is a great thing, hey, go eat it.
[02:16:58.120 --> 02:16:59.120]  You know-
[02:16:59.120 --> 02:17:04.720]  Well, the Vermont House overwhelmingly voted in favor of labeling as a state bill.
[02:17:04.720 --> 02:17:07.760]  Now, it hasn't gone to the Senate there yet.
[02:17:07.760 --> 02:17:13.920]  But that was the first time in US history that a house voted in favor of labeling.
[02:17:13.920 --> 02:17:20.720]  And last year, a explicit threat by Monsanto's attorney to the state of Vermont saying that
[02:17:20.720 --> 02:17:26.560]  they would sue the state caused the governor to essentially deep six the legislation at
[02:17:26.560 --> 02:17:27.560]  that time.
[02:17:27.560 --> 02:17:33.560]  So we're hoping that the governor finds his power and his energy and is willing to stand
[02:17:33.560 --> 02:17:41.440]  up to Monsanto and do what 90% of his constituents and 90% of Americans want and what 64 countries
[02:17:41.440 --> 02:17:42.880]  already offer.
[02:17:42.880 --> 02:17:46.000]  And that's mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods.
[02:17:46.000 --> 02:17:51.720]  Now, there's also live bills in many other states, including a ballot initiative in Washington
[02:17:51.720 --> 02:17:52.720]  state.
[02:17:52.720 --> 02:17:57.880]  We saw that last year, a ballot initiative narrowly failed in California when the biotech
[02:17:57.880 --> 02:18:03.600]  industry spent more than a million dollars a day lying about the impacts of labeling.
[02:18:03.600 --> 02:18:09.280]  But we think that Washington has a better chance, whereas California, 48.6% voted in
[02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:10.680]  favor of labeling.
[02:18:10.680 --> 02:18:15.720]  We think we'll have the majority there and we may in fact win in Connecticut, Vermont,
[02:18:15.720 --> 02:18:19.240]  Maine and many other states.
[02:18:19.240 --> 02:18:24.680]  No one can argue with the right to have something labeled and again, they always lie and say,
[02:18:24.680 --> 02:18:26.160]  we've always crossed plants.
[02:18:26.160 --> 02:18:31.060]  They're not crossing the same subspecies or families.
[02:18:31.060 --> 02:18:34.560]  They're not even involved in hybridization and explain to people, we're going to break
[02:18:34.560 --> 02:18:37.040]  in a moment, but what's going on here?
[02:18:37.040 --> 02:18:42.600]  I mean, these are pharmacological crops, a lot of them and rats don't end up having a
[02:18:42.600 --> 02:18:44.080]  very good time eating this.
[02:18:44.080 --> 02:18:49.360]  Well, they take genes from one species like bacteria, soil bacteria, for example, that
[02:18:49.360 --> 02:18:55.320]  produces its own toxic insecticide and force it into the DNA of plants like corn.
[02:18:55.320 --> 02:19:01.960]  A study that came out this week showed that when albino mice were fed this BT toxin, it
[02:19:01.960 --> 02:19:07.520]  caused damage to their red blood cells and possible advancement of leukemia.
[02:19:07.520 --> 02:19:12.000]  Other studies have shown that this BT toxin can poke holes in human cells, can end up
[02:19:12.000 --> 02:19:16.960]  in human blood and in the blood of unborn fetuses and it pokes holes in the cells and
[02:19:16.960 --> 02:19:21.440]  so when it gets in the brain, because there's no blood brain barrier developed in the fetuses,
[02:19:21.440 --> 02:19:23.600]  it might be causing brain damage as well.
[02:19:23.600 --> 02:19:28.880]  So this is an example of something that they've concocted and put on the market claiming that
[02:19:28.880 --> 02:19:34.520]  this BT toxin, which is known to break open the stomach of insects to kill them, is not
[02:19:34.520 --> 02:19:38.600]  harmful for humans or mammals and now we know it's not true.
[02:19:38.600 --> 02:19:42.600]  So what's wrong with a little leukemia?
[02:19:42.600 --> 02:19:48.400]  I mean cancer rates are up, I mean we are getting rid of the excess population, that'll
[02:19:48.400 --> 02:19:54.120]  save the earth, I mean maybe, maybe the answer is feed our children extra GMO, they'll be
[02:19:54.120 --> 02:19:57.360]  free once they're in little coffins six feet under.
[02:19:57.360 --> 02:20:01.320]  Mr. Smith, please stay with us.
[02:20:01.320 --> 02:20:03.360]  Have you ever consumed protein powder supplements?
[02:20:03.360 --> 02:20:08.160]  I have and all of them don't taste that good, have artificial flavors, sweeteners or unhealthy
[02:20:08.160 --> 02:20:09.160]  sugars.
[02:20:09.160 --> 02:20:13.200]  About a year ago, I was introduced to a new protein powder that changed my experience.
[02:20:13.200 --> 02:20:17.260]  This protein powder made me feel noticeably better and it tasted more delicious than any
[02:20:17.260 --> 02:20:19.080]  drink I've ever had.
[02:20:19.080 --> 02:20:22.080]  Here's the experience of one satisfied user named Rich.
[02:20:22.080 --> 02:20:26.760]  The term best of all worlds has been belabored to death and yet I've just discovered a whey
[02:20:26.760 --> 02:20:32.760]  protein powder that truly deserves to be called best of all worlds, best taste by far, best
[02:20:32.760 --> 02:20:34.720]  results by far.
[02:20:34.720 --> 02:20:39.160]  We almost feel like you're cheating that something that tastes that good could be so good for
[02:20:39.160 --> 02:20:40.160]  you.
[02:20:40.160 --> 02:20:42.280]  Thank you Steven and Cocoon Nutrition.
[02:20:42.280 --> 02:20:47.080]  One World Whey truly is the best of all worlds, the only way for me.

[02:21:15.260 --> 02:21:16.260]  their homes.
[02:21:16.260 --> 02:21:19.160]  Half of Americans need help just to feed themselves.
[02:21:19.160 --> 02:21:22.920]  Legalized pollution of our food is sickening us with cancer and disease.

[02:22:29.080 --> 02:22:31.560]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[02:22:31.560 --> 02:22:35.280]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold
[02:22:35.280 --> 02:22:36.280]  IRAs?
[02:22:36.280 --> 02:22:40.340]  They've been available since 1986 yet the financial industry won't recognize the value
[02:22:40.340 --> 02:22:42.040]  of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:42.040 --> 02:22:45.520]  Gold is outperformed paper investments yet no word about IRAs.
[02:22:45.520 --> 02:22:50.520]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement call 800-686-2237.

[02:23:34.280 --> 02:23:38.920]  If Obama has his way all guns will be either banned, restricted or confiscated, possibly
[02:23:38.920 --> 02:23:40.560]  by executive order.
[02:23:40.560 --> 02:23:43.000]  The best way to keep your guns is to hide them.
[02:23:43.000 --> 02:23:45.600]  What Obama can't find, Obama can't take away.
[02:23:45.600 --> 02:23:47.920]  You can protect your guns from any threat.

[02:24:07.040 --> 02:24:12.080]  By the way, major studies come out on a weekly basis, more than a weekly.
[02:24:12.080 --> 02:24:13.080]  Every few days.
[02:24:13.080 --> 02:24:14.080]  Big, prestigious ones.
[02:24:14.080 --> 02:24:18.160]  I think Smith can always go over them, that's why his books are so important, they're like
[02:24:18.160 --> 02:24:19.160]  textbooks.
[02:24:19.160 --> 02:24:20.160]  Everything's documented, everything's very conservative.
[02:24:20.160 --> 02:24:24.520]  And he says, maybe linked, I mean it's overwhelming.
[02:24:24.520 --> 02:24:28.320]  Like Harvard's come out and admitted that they looked at 20 plus studies and oh yeah,
[02:24:28.320 --> 02:24:32.360]  sodium hydrofluorosolic acid is causing brain damage and cancer.
[02:24:32.360 --> 02:24:33.360]  Why are they putting it in the water?
[02:24:33.360 --> 02:24:37.280]  This is a toxic waste that they have to pay to store, so put it in the water.
[02:24:37.280 --> 02:24:38.600]  They call it fluoride.
[02:24:38.600 --> 02:24:42.100]  Really even worse, some of its electrons manipulated.
[02:24:42.100 --> 02:24:46.620]  And so what Smith's getting into here is just the tip of the iceberg.
[02:24:46.620 --> 02:24:50.680]  And he is conservative about it all, but even being conservative, it's pretty bad.
[02:24:50.680 --> 02:24:55.700]  I saw a big study out last week where pesticides are linked to autism, no kidding.
[02:24:55.700 --> 02:25:00.240]  And GM, BTs are linked to brain damage, of course.
[02:25:00.240 --> 02:25:02.160]  I mean, it kills bugs.
[02:25:02.160 --> 02:25:08.560]  They go, well, it's naturally currying fungus, what, 100, 200, 1,000 times?
[02:25:08.560 --> 02:25:10.600]  Depending on the variety, stronger?
[02:25:10.600 --> 02:25:11.600]  And then you eat it?
[02:25:11.600 --> 02:25:14.440]  I mean, bugs can't eat it, but you're supposed to.
[02:25:14.440 --> 02:25:17.880]  Jeffrey, what else is going on in the fight right now with the Supreme Court ruling?
[02:25:17.880 --> 02:25:20.280]  What are some of the new studies out there?
[02:25:20.280 --> 02:25:24.440]  It looks like we're winning the fight for hearts and minds, but Monsanto and others
[02:25:24.440 --> 02:25:25.980]  are in power.
[02:25:25.980 --> 02:25:32.680]  And so it's the immovable object comes up against an unstoppable force.
[02:25:32.680 --> 02:25:33.680]  What's going to happen?
[02:25:33.680 --> 02:25:39.680]  Well, I do think that we're winning the overall war, but not on the level of the federal government
[02:25:39.680 --> 02:25:41.580]  and not on the level of the courts.
[02:25:41.580 --> 02:25:48.160]  The Supreme Court yesterday just announced that Monsanto won its court case against a
[02:25:48.160 --> 02:25:55.860]  farmer who purchased some seeds, actually some feed from a mill and planted it and tried
[02:25:55.860 --> 02:26:01.340]  to say that the patent didn't apply because it was basically the second generation of
[02:26:01.340 --> 02:26:02.680]  Monsanto's soybeans.
[02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:04.560]  Well, the court didn't go for that.
[02:26:04.560 --> 02:26:10.340]  It was interesting that Clarence Thomas did not recuse himself even though he was a former
[02:26:10.340 --> 02:26:12.120]  Monsanto lawyer.
[02:26:12.120 --> 02:26:17.720]  This is the third time that he didn't recuse himself on a GMO decision.
[02:26:17.720 --> 02:26:21.160]  So we've lost that recent one in the Supreme Court.
[02:26:21.160 --> 02:26:26.520]  A study came out today examining five years of the diplomatic cables.
[02:26:26.520 --> 02:26:30.840]  And there was about a thousand cables looked at over five years showing that the State
[02:26:30.840 --> 02:26:36.680]  Department is basically deployed as Monsanto's enforcement wing around the world trying to
[02:26:36.680 --> 02:26:39.900]  push biotechnology on other countries.
[02:26:39.900 --> 02:26:46.440]  We see that the USDA is basically marching lockstep with Monsanto, with one exception.
[02:26:46.440 --> 02:26:50.420]  This week they did announce, actually last Friday afternoon, they did announce that they
[02:26:50.420 --> 02:26:55.840]  weren't going to give a rubber stamp approval of the Agent Orange crops.
[02:26:55.840 --> 02:27:01.200]  Those are crops genetically engineered not to die when sprayed with 2,4-D, one of the
[02:27:01.200 --> 02:27:06.400]  components of Agent Orange, and those that are genetically engineered to resist dicamba.
[02:27:06.400 --> 02:27:11.360]  Both very, very serious toxins could cause serious health issues.
[02:27:11.360 --> 02:27:16.800]  And they said they wanted an environmental impact statement done before they looked at
[02:27:16.800 --> 02:27:17.800]  the approval process.
[02:27:17.800 --> 02:27:20.680]  Not to mention all this stuff now filling the water table.
[02:27:20.680 --> 02:27:21.680]  Absolutely.
[02:27:21.680 --> 02:27:27.600]  What we have now, glyphosate, which is the active ingredient of Roundup, was the subject
[02:27:27.600 --> 02:27:30.080]  of a 49-page study.
[02:27:30.080 --> 02:27:32.360]  And I just interviewed one of the co-authors.
[02:27:32.360 --> 02:27:38.120]  It's going to be available on our website probably tomorrow, responsibletechnology.org,
[02:27:38.120 --> 02:27:45.200]  where glyphosate and Roundup are linked to autism, obesity, diabetes, heart disease,
[02:27:45.200 --> 02:27:51.680]  multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, virtually as they say every single disease
[02:27:51.680 --> 02:27:57.800]  related to a Western diet, anorexia nervosa, anxiety, aggression.
[02:27:57.800 --> 02:28:04.720]  It turns out that Roundup, or its active ingredient glyphosate, it disables a couple of very important
[02:28:04.720 --> 02:28:06.780]  metabolic pathways.
[02:28:06.780 --> 02:28:09.640]  And it disables them in our gut bacteria.
[02:28:09.640 --> 02:28:16.280]  So it causes, for example, a problem in producing tryptophan, which is the precursor to serotonin.
[02:28:16.280 --> 02:28:19.320]  Serotonin will tell the body, you're full now, stop eating.
[02:28:19.320 --> 02:28:22.720]  So if there's not enough serotonin, you may just keep eating.
[02:28:22.720 --> 02:28:28.440]  Serotonin is also important for sleep and stress levels, etc.
[02:28:28.440 --> 02:28:30.420]  And that may be negatively involved.
[02:28:30.420 --> 02:28:36.480]  The whole ability for the cells to pull sugar out of the blood may be compromised because
[02:28:36.480 --> 02:28:37.480]  of another aspect.
[02:28:37.480 --> 02:28:38.640]  Let me just stop you for a minute here.
[02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:40.680]  Think about this, folks.
[02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:46.840]  We've got the highest level of diabetes in the world, highest level of cancer, most obese.
[02:28:46.840 --> 02:28:49.360]  IQs are lowering.
[02:28:49.360 --> 02:28:50.760]  That's not just education.
[02:28:50.760 --> 02:28:51.760]  We're being poisoned.
[02:28:51.760 --> 02:28:56.600]  I mean, it's a cocktail of things, and the power structure knows this.
[02:28:56.600 --> 02:28:59.120]  I mean, what do you think they're up to?
[02:28:59.120 --> 02:29:00.480]  They just don't care?
[02:29:00.480 --> 02:29:03.760]  Well, they continue to ignore the research.
[02:29:03.760 --> 02:29:10.880]  I remember talking to a FDA official who was very high up in GMO evaluations.
[02:29:10.880 --> 02:29:14.680]  And I told you the two different studies that we were aware of and have been talking about
[02:29:14.680 --> 02:29:16.000]  for years.
[02:29:16.000 --> 02:29:21.720]  One that showed that genes can transfer into the DNA of gut bacteria and potentially continue
[02:29:21.720 --> 02:29:27.080]  to function, which means long after we stop eating GMOs, we may be producing this toxic
[02:29:27.080 --> 02:29:30.160]  insecticide or the Roundup Ready gene.
[02:29:30.160 --> 02:29:35.800]  And also that genes may be unstable because there was evidence showing that the genetic
[02:29:35.800 --> 02:29:41.160]  sequence of the same event but analyzed in two different laboratories were different,
[02:29:41.160 --> 02:29:44.000]  which means it might produce something completely unexpected.
[02:29:44.000 --> 02:29:45.360]  Mutations, stay there.
[02:29:45.360 --> 02:29:46.360]  We've got to come right back.
[02:29:46.360 --> 02:29:50.320]  Long segment coming up with the GMO expert.
[02:29:50.320 --> 02:29:51.600]  We're on the march.
[02:29:51.600 --> 02:29:54.000]  The empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.000 --> 02:30:01.620]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.620 --> 02:30:05.040]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms.
[02:30:05.040 --> 02:30:09.000]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your
[02:30:09.000 --> 02:30:11.080]  arsenal for home protection.
[02:30:11.080 --> 02:30:15.000]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[02:31:06.480 --> 02:31:10.540]  big media won't dare talk about, threats that trample the American dream.
[02:31:10.540 --> 02:31:15.440]  You know what we all face, a crashing economy that's forcing millions out of work and from
[02:31:15.440 --> 02:31:16.480]  their homes.
[02:31:16.480 --> 02:31:19.400]  Life of Americans need help just to feed themselves.
[02:31:19.400 --> 02:31:23.160]  Legalized pollution of our food is sickening us with cancer and disease.

[02:32:01.840 --> 02:32:06.520]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our
[02:32:06.520 --> 02:32:08.580]  immunity and health.
[02:32:08.580 --> 02:32:13.180]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of

[02:33:08.440 --> 02:33:17.160]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance.
[02:33:17.160 --> 02:33:31.760]  Rallying patriots worldwide, you're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:31.760 --> 02:33:37.040]  Every time I go to a restaurant, every time I sit there and I look at my darling little
[02:33:37.040 --> 02:33:41.440]  children and I realize that I'm on the road and I'm being lazy and I just go into some
[02:33:41.440 --> 02:33:47.680]  place and just feed them, even if it's a healthy food, I know it's got GMO in it, I know it's
[02:33:47.680 --> 02:33:48.680]  got hormones.
[02:33:48.680 --> 02:33:54.880]  It is hard to try to keep my children off GMO, but they're probably off of it 90% of
[02:33:54.880 --> 02:33:57.260]  the time.
[02:33:57.260 --> 02:34:01.720]  And they know as mammals that if they just put something out in the environment, we will
[02:34:01.720 --> 02:34:05.240]  just take it and accept it and we'll muddle through it.
[02:34:05.240 --> 02:34:11.440]  They'll use our capacity to adapt and improvise in hard situations to put up with this.
[02:34:11.440 --> 02:34:18.920]  I was once on first class airplane flight going to be on The View and there was the
[02:34:18.920 --> 02:34:25.320]  president of a major bank, I was leaving at that because he figured out who I was at the
[02:34:25.320 --> 02:34:26.320]  end.
[02:34:26.320 --> 02:34:31.040]  I got pretty upset that he'd been talking to me and he just said, it doesn't matter
[02:34:31.040 --> 02:34:32.040]  what you do.
[02:34:32.040 --> 02:34:37.840]  They don't put up with anything, it's their adaptiveness and the fact that we know they're
[02:34:37.840 --> 02:34:41.240]  adaptive talking about us like we're not even human and I already knew this, but having
[02:34:41.240 --> 02:34:49.160]  this guy tell me this, I've seen on TV, you know his name, to have him sit there, he was
[02:34:49.160 --> 02:34:55.880]  flying down here to see his retired general father who lives in San Antonio.
[02:34:55.880 --> 02:35:02.680]  I sat there for three hours on the New York flight while this guy and we talked and off
[02:35:02.680 --> 02:35:03.680]  and on.
[02:35:03.680 --> 02:35:11.840]  He had the perfect gray hair, the perfect black trench coat, cashmere when he got up
[02:35:11.840 --> 02:35:12.840]  and put it on.
[02:35:12.840 --> 02:35:16.560]  His suit, even though he'd been on a flight, looked perfect and he looked like a James
[02:35:16.560 --> 02:35:20.760]  Bond type guy and I told him, I said, doesn't matter how slick you are, you're gonna be
[02:35:20.760 --> 02:35:22.160]  defeated in the end.
[02:35:22.160 --> 02:35:30.600]  He was just like, but what he said repeatedly is the people will muddle through anything
[02:35:30.600 --> 02:35:34.560]  and they use that, they use our own adaptiveness and the fact that we'll put up with so much
[02:35:34.560 --> 02:35:38.440]  to not notice the ambient background of all this that's being turned up and they know
[02:35:38.440 --> 02:35:40.720]  full well what they're doing.
[02:35:40.720 --> 02:35:44.200]  It's come out in Monsanto 15 years ago, it came out in the news and then again 10 years
[02:35:44.200 --> 02:35:50.040]  ago and then again last year at their own facilities doesn't eat their own GMO and demands
[02:35:50.040 --> 02:35:51.880]  organic.
[02:35:51.880 --> 02:35:55.320]  The communist Chinese elite demand their own secret farms, that's come out and it's been
[02:35:55.320 --> 02:35:57.040]  a big scandal.
[02:35:57.040 --> 02:36:01.080]  It's the same thing in Europe, the quote clean vaccines the German government and British
[02:36:01.080 --> 02:36:02.080]  government got.
[02:36:02.080 --> 02:36:06.500]  See, I'm not even so much against vaccine technology, folks, I know you can get some
[02:36:06.500 --> 02:36:07.640]  immunity from that.
[02:36:07.640 --> 02:36:11.680]  It's that you can't trust these companies who have these histories of testing and all
[02:36:11.680 --> 02:36:15.160]  this and all the autism and all this.
[02:36:15.160 --> 02:36:20.880]  My point is that we have to get conscious of what's happening, it's like if you put
[02:36:20.880 --> 02:36:27.080]  a slow kill poison in a pond to kill feral hogs, it's illegal but people do it cuz they're
[02:36:27.080 --> 02:36:30.720]  out of control in Texas, invasive species.
[02:36:30.720 --> 02:36:35.360]  And cuz they've already eaten all the baby deer, run off the deer, taken the deer's forage,
[02:36:35.360 --> 02:36:37.560]  there's no deer they're gonna get poisoned, maybe some coyotes.
[02:36:37.560 --> 02:36:42.080]  You poison that pond and the deer will come and the pigs will come and they will drink
[02:36:42.080 --> 02:36:47.320]  from it and they don't know why everybody starts dying a week later.
[02:36:47.320 --> 02:36:52.320]  And it's the same thing, this is ambient, it builds up, and this is what they talk about
[02:36:52.320 --> 02:36:56.000]  in Ecoscience by the White House, Science Czar is putting stuff in our food and water,
[02:36:56.000 --> 02:36:57.520]  the UN's been caught doing it.
[02:36:57.520 --> 02:37:01.200]  Now, I get into why they're doing it, a lot of its companies don't care.
[02:37:01.200 --> 02:37:04.440]  So the globalists just let other companies that just don't care do whatever they want.
[02:37:04.440 --> 02:37:10.040]  I mean, it's a lot of neglect, not caring, bear with the factor rate, millions of ampules
[02:37:10.040 --> 02:37:14.760]  filled with HIV and hepatitis, knowing it was a death sentence for a decade, selling
[02:37:14.760 --> 02:37:15.760]  it out in the public.
[02:37:15.760 --> 02:37:21.800]  And then when it came out in court in Australia and France, the executives are like, well,
[02:37:21.800 --> 02:37:28.880]  they're hemophiliacs anyways, they're a drain on society, let them die.
[02:37:28.880 --> 02:37:31.920]  Those are a lot of people people love, these people that had lives and were treating their
[02:37:31.920 --> 02:37:35.140]  hemophilia and living a good life, and you killed them.
[02:37:35.140 --> 02:37:39.180]  And then you're like, yeah, let them, you know what, I say you're not human, how would
[02:37:39.180 --> 02:37:44.440]  you like being lined up and shot up full of hepatitis, you punks?
[02:37:44.440 --> 02:37:46.680]  How would you like that?
[02:37:46.680 --> 02:37:52.920]  Stop treating us like we're animals, excuse me, I'm going back to our guest, Jeffrey Smith.
[02:37:52.920 --> 02:37:58.320]  Folks, I have empathy because my instincts are aligned with life, not because I'm some
[02:37:58.320 --> 02:37:59.960]  wimp.
[02:37:59.960 --> 02:38:03.400]  Real men have empathy, ladies and gentlemen, because what happens to other people is gonna
[02:38:03.400 --> 02:38:04.400]  happen to us.
[02:38:04.400 --> 02:38:09.480]  And I have to go through hell, I have to go through hell to try to keep my kids off the
[02:38:09.480 --> 02:38:12.800]  stuff that I see other people's kids who look like they're death.
[02:38:12.800 --> 02:38:17.460]  You go look how unhealthy people are, how dumb people are, and all the weird diseases
[02:38:17.460 --> 02:38:19.240]  and isms and things that are happening.
[02:38:19.240 --> 02:38:23.720]  And it's all linked to the chemical diet, the bio crap, all of it.
[02:38:23.720 --> 02:38:26.540]  I'm sorry, Jeffrey, I'm ranting, this stuff gets to me.
[02:38:26.540 --> 02:38:31.480]  Because I know I'm right, I know you're right, I know the history, and it just doesn't stop.
[02:38:31.480 --> 02:38:36.520]  And the arrogance of these people, and there's no way these elitists that are doing this,
[02:38:36.520 --> 02:38:39.480]  even though they try to avoid it, there's no way they can avoid it.
[02:38:39.480 --> 02:38:43.440]  Is it the proof of them trying to avoid it through the entire power structure, proof
[02:38:43.440 --> 02:38:45.320]  that they know?
[02:38:45.320 --> 02:38:50.160]  Well I talked to a former Monsanto scientist and he said three of his colleagues were testing
[02:38:50.160 --> 02:38:54.440]  the milk from cows treated with Monsanto's bovine growth hormone.
[02:38:54.440 --> 02:38:59.920]  And they found so much cancer promoting IGF-1 hormone in the milk that the three Monsanto
[02:38:59.920 --> 02:39:04.120]  scientists refused to drink milk thereafter unless it was organic.
[02:39:04.120 --> 02:39:05.680]  One bought his own cow.
[02:39:05.680 --> 02:39:11.040]  Now it was clear, obvious, that these three Monsanto scientists believe that the milk
[02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:16.480]  might be creating cancer, refused to feed it to their families, and yet they somehow
[02:39:16.480 --> 02:39:23.240]  felt either okay or at least powerless to stop the company that they worked for from
[02:39:23.240 --> 02:39:25.520]  marketing it to the rest of the public.
[02:39:25.520 --> 02:39:27.720]  Now you talked about your kids and bringing them out to eat.
[02:39:27.720 --> 02:39:31.760]  I wanna share a story that happened three weeks ago at MIT.
[02:39:31.760 --> 02:39:36.960]  I was giving a talk at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology along with Stephanie, Dr. Stephanie
[02:39:36.960 --> 02:39:43.280]  Seneff, who I interview and her interview is gonna come out tomorrow at responsibletechnology.org.
[02:39:43.280 --> 02:39:47.920]  A fascinating interview about the dangers of glyphosate, we're Roundup.
[02:39:47.920 --> 02:39:53.080]  And I asked the audience, as I typically do these days, how many of you have avoided GMOs
[02:39:53.080 --> 02:39:55.440]  and noticed a change in your health?
[02:39:55.440 --> 02:40:00.080]  And a woman shot up her head and said, I saw your film recently, Genetic Roulette, The
[02:40:00.080 --> 02:40:01.080]  Gamble of Our Lives.
[02:40:01.080 --> 02:40:02.920]  Now you have that on your site.
[02:40:02.920 --> 02:40:06.620]  It's the most powerful, game changing video.
[02:40:06.620 --> 02:40:09.080]  It changes people's diet on the spot.
[02:40:09.080 --> 02:40:12.720]  She saw the film and a light bulb went off.
[02:40:12.720 --> 02:40:17.160]  Her six and a half year old boy was desperately aggressive, out of control.
[02:40:17.160 --> 02:40:18.960]  They tried to call him retarded.
[02:40:18.960 --> 02:40:21.080]  They wanted to take him out of school.
[02:40:21.080 --> 02:40:26.480]  She saw other parents in the video describing the improvements of their autistic kids.
[02:40:26.480 --> 02:40:30.560]  They saw farmers talking about the improvements in their animals.
[02:40:30.560 --> 02:40:33.120]  Doctors talking about the improvements in their patients.
[02:40:33.120 --> 02:40:38.840]  So she immediately took her child off of all genetically modified foods and said she has
[02:40:38.840 --> 02:40:40.440]  a new child now.
[02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:44.520]  He's no longer aggressive, no longer being threatened with the term retarded.
[02:40:44.520 --> 02:40:46.400]  No one wants to take him out of school.
[02:40:46.400 --> 02:40:50.880]  He's completely calm and well organized in his brain.
[02:40:50.880 --> 02:40:53.240]  Now this is one of numerous stories.
[02:40:53.240 --> 02:40:58.640]  I've heard thousands of stories of people talking about allergies and asthma and brain
[02:40:58.640 --> 02:41:06.400]  fog and lethargy and skin problems and kidney disease, infertility, gastrointestinal disorders,
[02:41:06.400 --> 02:41:11.120]  a whole host of problems getting better when they stop eating GMOs.
[02:41:11.120 --> 02:41:16.280]  And I've been to the doctor's offices with cameras interviewing the doctors and the patients.
[02:41:16.280 --> 02:41:20.440]  Some patients say they got rid of Crohn's disease in three days or irritable bowel in
[02:41:20.440 --> 02:41:21.440]  six weeks.
[02:41:21.440 --> 02:41:22.440]  Incredible.
[02:41:22.440 --> 02:41:27.540]  And when you look at them, when you look at the individuals removing GMOs from their diet,
[02:41:27.540 --> 02:41:30.400]  they may have to buy organic or reduce processed foods.
[02:41:30.400 --> 02:41:34.120]  So there's potential cofactors and I understand, you know what I mean by cofactors.
[02:41:34.120 --> 02:41:36.520]  Maybe it's the additives that are being taken out.
[02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:43.800]  But when the livestock remove GM soy and replace it only with non GM soy, remove GM corn and
[02:41:43.800 --> 02:41:47.320]  replace it with non GM corn, there are no cofactors.
[02:41:47.320 --> 02:41:51.780]  It's just that one change and they get rid of diary in two or three days.
[02:41:51.780 --> 02:41:56.920]  They get rid of birth defects, no more deaths from ulcers, medicine rates go down dramatically.
[02:41:56.920 --> 02:42:00.880]  I've talked to so many farmers more than a decade ago, a lot of family that are farmers.
[02:42:00.880 --> 02:42:02.240]  I live around farmers.
[02:42:02.240 --> 02:42:04.000]  They say, look, we go on GMO.
[02:42:04.000 --> 02:42:06.140]  We start having most our calves born dead.
[02:42:06.140 --> 02:42:08.040]  The baby pigs die.
[02:42:08.040 --> 02:42:09.880]  Everything starts dying.
[02:42:09.880 --> 02:42:13.640]  And because it has pesticides in it, it has all sorts of other things engineered into
[02:42:13.640 --> 02:42:14.640]  it.
[02:42:14.640 --> 02:42:16.380]  I want you to get into some of the science here.
[02:42:16.380 --> 02:42:22.440]  But again, this is something that the power structure that you just mentioned knows and
[02:42:22.440 --> 02:42:23.440]  is aware of.
[02:42:23.440 --> 02:42:29.520]  So my question to you is, what do you expect to happen with this?
[02:42:29.520 --> 02:42:31.960]  As the diabetes, the cancer, everything goes up.
[02:42:31.960 --> 02:42:37.000]  As more and more studies come out linking it to this, will we have Nuremberg trials
[02:42:37.000 --> 02:42:38.400]  for these GMO companies?
[02:42:38.400 --> 02:42:45.140]  Well, I'm actually doing some deep research into linking GMOs with autism, with allergies,
[02:42:45.140 --> 02:42:49.580]  with asthma, with gluten sensitivity, infertility and gut problems.
[02:42:49.580 --> 02:42:54.720]  And I'm working with some of the top professionals and practitioners in these areas to show the
[02:42:54.720 --> 02:42:55.720]  link.
[02:42:55.720 --> 02:42:59.400]  Now, what's happening, however, is good news, Alex, and that is that as people watch the
[02:42:59.400 --> 02:43:05.840]  movie Genetic Roulette or they go to our website, NonGMOShoppingGuide.com or download our free
[02:43:05.840 --> 02:43:13.080]  app, Shop No GMO and learn to avoid GMOs, then it's applying economic pressure to the
[02:43:13.080 --> 02:43:14.240]  food companies.
[02:43:14.240 --> 02:43:22.080]  So last year in 2012, products that were labeled non-GMO grew in sales by 26%, outpacing all
[02:43:22.080 --> 02:43:23.640]  other categories.
[02:43:23.640 --> 02:43:27.480]  In fact, when Whole Foods announced it was gonna require labeling in five years, they
[02:43:27.480 --> 02:43:33.320]  told USA Today that when a product becomes third party verified as non-GMO, sales increase
[02:43:33.320 --> 02:43:35.040]  15 to 30%.
[02:43:35.040 --> 02:43:38.480]  Now, we know that the rest of the food companies are listening.
[02:43:38.480 --> 02:43:42.800]  So is free market voting with our dollars is the only main weapon we've got?
[02:43:42.800 --> 02:43:47.920]  It's the main weapon we've got plus the possibility of passing some of these labeling laws in
[02:43:47.920 --> 02:43:53.080]  states, which again allows for voting with our dollars by choosing the non-GMO.
[02:43:53.080 --> 02:43:55.340]  So yes, we have the power here.
[02:43:55.340 --> 02:43:59.500]  We don't wanna give up the power and say the FDA will bail us out or the USDA will bail
[02:43:59.500 --> 02:44:00.500]  us out.
[02:44:00.500 --> 02:44:02.120]  And you know that as well as I do.
[02:44:02.120 --> 02:44:06.700]  And in the case of GMOs, the biotech industry has been calling the shots.
[02:44:06.700 --> 02:44:12.440]  It was Monsanto's former attorney at the FDA who was in charge of GMO policy, ignored the
[02:44:12.440 --> 02:44:16.840]  warnings of the scientists working at the agency and said no testing was necessary.
[02:44:16.840 --> 02:44:19.520]  They own the Supreme Court everything, it's a total joke.
[02:44:19.520 --> 02:44:20.520]  Absolutely.
[02:44:20.520 --> 02:44:24.960]  So but what they don't own is the ability for you and I to get the information out to
[02:44:24.960 --> 02:44:28.900]  those who are health conscious, to parents who wanna protect their kids, to those who
[02:44:28.900 --> 02:44:33.180]  are sick, to healthcare professionals, to religious people that think GMO means God
[02:44:33.180 --> 02:44:34.180]  move over.
[02:44:34.180 --> 02:44:40.320]  We're targeting these receptive peoples, receptive low hanging non-GMO fruit as I call them.
[02:44:40.320 --> 02:44:46.040]  So when we start to get about 5% of US shoppers avoiding GM ingredients, that should be a
[02:44:46.040 --> 02:44:47.280]  tipping point.
[02:44:47.280 --> 02:44:51.500]  And what's happening now is we did a study on the impact of the movie Genetic Roulette,
[02:44:51.500 --> 02:44:53.160]  the gamble of our lives.
[02:44:53.160 --> 02:44:57.980]  And virtually everyone in the audience before the credits rolled were willing to change
[02:44:57.980 --> 02:45:02.280]  their diet on the spot and have their loved ones watch the same movie.
[02:45:02.280 --> 02:45:08.260]  Because when we have doctors speak about GMOs, they speak with far more conviction about
[02:45:08.260 --> 02:45:09.800]  the problems than I do.
[02:45:09.800 --> 02:45:15.840]  Because they get to experiment on their patients, they get to tell their patients, remove GMOs,
[02:45:15.840 --> 02:45:16.840]  let's see what happens.
[02:45:16.840 --> 02:45:18.880]  And they do it 10 times, 100 times.
[02:45:18.880 --> 02:45:24.920]  One woman did it 5,000 times and she said, it never doesn't work, everyone gets better.
[02:45:24.920 --> 02:45:29.920]  Which leads us to believe that GMOs are a major contributor to these wide variety of
[02:45:29.920 --> 02:45:34.540]  diseases that are on the rise in the US population since GMOs were introduced.
[02:45:34.540 --> 02:45:38.960]  And the same diseases and disorders on the rise are those that individuals are reporting
[02:45:38.960 --> 02:45:41.600]  go away when they eliminate GMOs.
[02:45:41.600 --> 02:45:44.600]  Wow, and they know the fluoride is deadly in our water.
[02:45:44.600 --> 02:45:49.240]  They know the aspartame is making people go blind and have early onset of neurological
[02:45:49.240 --> 02:45:50.240]  disorders.
[02:45:50.240 --> 02:45:52.120]  They know the GMO is just devastating.
[02:45:52.120 --> 02:45:55.780]  I mean, the studies that are in your books and videos, let's put them up on screen for
[02:45:55.780 --> 02:45:56.780]  TV viewers.
[02:45:56.780 --> 02:45:59.960]  Folks, you can support the work of Mr. Smith and Infowars.
[02:45:59.960 --> 02:46:02.400]  But more importantly, wake your friends and family up.
[02:46:02.400 --> 02:46:07.720]  If you can organize a showing in your neighborhood of Genetic Roulette, the film, and have the
[02:46:07.720 --> 02:46:11.840]  book there that's like a textbook that shows all the documents, that will save lives.
[02:46:11.840 --> 02:46:15.480]  And look, the journey of 1,000 miles starts with a single step.
[02:46:15.480 --> 02:46:21.320]  I mean, look at McDonald's, when I first heard like seven years ago on a news report that
[02:46:21.320 --> 02:46:23.600]  they had silicone in their McNuggets, I didn't believe it.
[02:46:23.600 --> 02:46:26.640]  And then I went and looked it up and they have loopholes called an additive and a bunch
[02:46:26.640 --> 02:46:27.640]  of other chains do it.
[02:46:27.640 --> 02:46:30.120]  I mean, it's not just GMO, it's like plastic in the food.
[02:46:30.120 --> 02:46:32.720]  I mean, no wonder there's kidney failure all over the place.
[02:46:32.720 --> 02:46:35.760]  It is so insane what they've gotten away with.
[02:46:35.760 --> 02:46:41.640]  So go to infowarsstore.com, get Genetic Roulette DVD book special, get a discount, get both
[02:46:41.640 --> 02:46:42.640]  of them together.
[02:46:42.640 --> 02:46:46.600]  That's why they don't want under No Child Left Behind teachers being able to teach where
[02:46:46.600 --> 02:46:48.340]  they just hand out packets now.
[02:46:48.340 --> 02:46:50.480]  They don't want a teacher sneaking in and showing this.
[02:46:50.480 --> 02:46:51.480]  Well, you know what?
[02:46:51.480 --> 02:46:52.480]  Break the rules.
[02:46:52.480 --> 02:46:57.380]  Go to your principal and say, I need to teach them how to love to learn, not how to be robots.
[02:46:57.380 --> 02:47:03.440]  We've got your churches should be showing Genetic Roulette and also the world according
[02:47:03.440 --> 02:47:10.920]  to Monsanto, Seeds of Deception, the case against fluoride, all of it available at infowarsstore.com.
[02:47:10.920 --> 02:47:14.200]  Now I've got to say this, we've got all the studies, the science, I want to get into that,
[02:47:14.200 --> 02:47:16.520]  other areas, because I don't want to just ask the questions.
[02:47:16.520 --> 02:47:20.360]  You're the expert here, but I research this every day so I can verify what you're saying
[02:47:20.360 --> 02:47:21.360]  and then a lot more.
[02:47:21.360 --> 02:47:25.040]  I know you're holding back because you're a big target here of these people, but you
[02:47:25.040 --> 02:47:26.460]  can see the worm turning.
[02:47:26.460 --> 02:47:31.080]  It's like almost like Monsanto was like, you know, Scientologists.
[02:47:31.080 --> 02:47:34.120]  People are scared to talk about them and suddenly they're not and people are scared to talk
[02:47:34.120 --> 02:47:35.120]  about Obama.
[02:47:35.120 --> 02:47:36.120]  Now they're not.
[02:47:36.120 --> 02:47:38.360]  It's kind of like the dam breaking.
[02:47:38.360 --> 02:47:44.440]  But I know so many engineers, scientists, oil company people that I've run into, family,
[02:47:44.440 --> 02:47:48.120]  people I know, doctors.
[02:47:48.120 --> 02:47:53.520]  One guy puts in silicon factories and I've talked to him and they'll say, man, you know
[02:47:53.520 --> 02:47:56.520]  what wakes me up about GMO?
[02:47:56.520 --> 02:47:59.880]  I probably talk no exaggeration more than 20 people told me this over the years, just
[02:47:59.880 --> 02:48:01.280]  anecdotally, separately.
[02:48:01.280 --> 02:48:10.600]  They go, you know, I went to Ukraine to help build an oil refinery or I went to Czech Republic
[02:48:10.600 --> 02:48:11.600]  to do this.
[02:48:11.600 --> 02:48:17.720]  That was in two cases or I went to Japan to put this in and they go, I lost 40 pounds
[02:48:17.720 --> 02:48:18.720]  in three months.
[02:48:18.720 --> 02:48:20.440]  Man, I drank like a fish.
[02:48:20.440 --> 02:48:22.040]  I ate like a pig.
[02:48:22.040 --> 02:48:23.640]  Those people stay up all night partying.
[02:48:23.640 --> 02:48:27.200]  I was saying about the Czech Republic, but they're all skinny and healthy.
[02:48:27.200 --> 02:48:29.600]  They live longer than us smoking cigarettes.
[02:48:29.600 --> 02:48:30.600]  What is the French?
[02:48:30.600 --> 02:48:33.440]  I talked to one guy who was doing stuff and he goes, man, they smoke cigarettes.
[02:48:33.440 --> 02:48:34.800]  They get drunk every night.
[02:48:34.800 --> 02:48:35.800]  They party constantly.
[02:48:35.800 --> 02:48:37.160]  They sleep four hours a night.
[02:48:37.160 --> 02:48:39.040]  They look great.
[02:48:39.040 --> 02:48:43.280]  Everybody I talk to, men, women, they go to Europe and places that don't have GMO and
[02:48:43.280 --> 02:48:44.280]  they get healthy.
[02:48:44.280 --> 02:48:45.280]  What's going on?
[02:48:45.280 --> 02:48:49.600]  We've heard that same thing for many years and sometimes it's even more specific, Alex.
[02:48:49.600 --> 02:48:54.520]  Sometimes people say I can't have soy in the US, but when I have soy in Europe, it doesn't
[02:48:54.520 --> 02:48:55.920]  cause a reaction.
[02:48:55.920 --> 02:48:57.080]  Same with corn.
[02:48:57.080 --> 02:49:02.400]  That's because the tipping point of consumer rejection did kick GMOs out of direct derivatives
[02:49:02.400 --> 02:49:05.160]  in Europe in the 27 countries there.
[02:49:05.160 --> 02:49:09.220]  They do have animal feed that's genetically engineered, but they don't have soy lecithin
[02:49:09.220 --> 02:49:12.600]  or high fructose corn syrup, etc that we have here.
[02:49:12.600 --> 02:49:18.180]  Likewise, when people say that they can eat the organic varieties, but not the GM varieties,
[02:49:18.180 --> 02:49:22.960]  this gives us an indication that it is in fact the GMO that's causing the problem.
[02:49:22.960 --> 02:49:27.600]  Now the study that came out that you mentioned earlier in September of last year, this was
[02:49:27.600 --> 02:49:30.960]  trying to define what's causing the problem.
[02:49:30.960 --> 02:49:35.680]  Is it the genetic engineering or is it the Roundup that gets poured onto these Roundup
[02:49:35.680 --> 02:49:36.960]  ready crops?
[02:49:36.960 --> 02:49:42.200]  So they took rats that were eating either genetically engineered corn that was Roundup
[02:49:42.200 --> 02:49:48.040]  ready, so it was sprayed with Roundup, or they were just eating Roundup in their water
[02:49:48.040 --> 02:49:52.520]  supply or they were just eating the corn that wasn't treated with Roundup.
[02:49:52.520 --> 02:49:57.640]  But in all three cases, Alex, the animals got early death, organ damage, and massive
[02:49:57.640 --> 02:49:59.000]  multiple tumors.
[02:49:59.000 --> 02:50:04.600]  Up to 80% of the female rats had tumors mostly in the mammary glands.
[02:50:04.600 --> 02:50:11.080]  So in this case, we think it's both the Roundup herbicide that's sprayed on the crops, as
[02:50:11.080 --> 02:50:16.680]  well as the massive collateral damage that occurs in the DNA as a result of the process
[02:50:16.680 --> 02:50:18.120]  of genetic engineering.
[02:50:18.120 --> 02:50:19.820]  So it's a double whammy.
[02:50:19.820 --> 02:50:25.020]  When you have this sweet corn that they're selling in Walmart that's Monsanto sweet corn,
[02:50:25.020 --> 02:50:31.240]  it's not only Roundup ready, but it also produces the BT toxin that we know breaks holes with
[02:50:31.240 --> 02:50:33.840]  the holes in human cells causing leakage.
[02:50:33.840 --> 02:50:40.440]  If it causes leaky gut, many scientists link that with autoimmune disease, with allergies,
[02:50:40.440 --> 02:50:43.680]  asthma, cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's-
[02:50:43.680 --> 02:50:46.760]  And that's why it affects behavior.
[02:50:46.760 --> 02:50:48.280]  You drink, it affects your brain.
[02:50:48.280 --> 02:50:50.840]  Well, you eat a bunch of pesticide garbage.
[02:50:50.840 --> 02:50:52.080]  You're going to get irritable.
[02:50:52.080 --> 02:50:53.080]  You're going to get aggressive.
[02:50:53.080 --> 02:50:55.920]  We'll be right back with our amazing guest, Jeffrey Smith.
[02:50:55.920 --> 02:50:59.080]  Get the books and videos at infowarsstore.com.
[02:50:59.080 --> 02:51:01.080]  Battle them with your dollars.
[02:51:01.080 --> 02:51:05.520]  Gardeners, here comes another growing season, but don't use last year's soil.
[02:51:05.520 --> 02:51:08.920]  Maximize yields in your survival garden with EM1 from Terreganics.
[02:51:08.920 --> 02:51:13.340]  EM1 is an organic soil conditioner, fertilizer amendment, and compost accelerant that provides
[02:51:13.340 --> 02:51:17.860]  a broad spectrum of beneficial microorganisms, enzymes, trace minerals, vitamins, and various
[02:51:17.860 --> 02:51:19.080]  organic acids.
[02:51:19.080 --> 02:51:23.360]  EM1 helps regulate the soil's pH level and its soil microbes, improving moisture retention
[02:51:23.360 --> 02:51:24.360]  and drought tolerance.
[02:51:24.360 --> 02:51:26.360]  Remember, last year's dry conditions?
[02:51:26.360 --> 02:51:31.320]  EM1 from Terreganics is safe, chemical-free, and certified for use on all organic farms.
[02:51:31.320 --> 02:51:35.960]  It improves plant quality, size, color, flavor, and gives up to 20% more nutrient value in
[02:51:35.960 --> 02:51:38.680]  fruits and vegetables, and greatly increases shelf life.
[02:51:38.680 --> 02:51:42.120]  And EM1 is so simple to use, just mix with water and apply.
[02:51:42.120 --> 02:51:46.720]  This year, prepare your crisis garden for maximum yields with EM1 from Terreganics.com.

[02:52:08.480 --> 02:52:13.680]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:52:13.680 --> 02:52:22.240]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:52:22.240 --> 02:52:29.200]  They sew pride in every stitch, guarantee you love the way they fit.
[02:52:29.200 --> 02:52:35.360]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch where you need it most.
[02:52:35.360 --> 02:52:40.400]  Blue diamond gusset's got it, others don't.
[02:52:40.400 --> 02:52:47.160]  White turned jeans inside out, diamond gusset jeans, made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[02:52:56.840 --> 02:52:59.720]  Diamond gusset jeans got it, others don't.
[02:52:59.720 --> 02:53:04.680]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the bestselling book, Cancer Step Outside the
[02:53:04.680 --> 02:53:05.680]  Box.
[02:53:05.680 --> 02:53:08.620]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:53:08.620 --> 02:53:13.440]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that Carnivora be sent directly to the White
[02:53:13.440 --> 02:53:17.760]  House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:53:17.760 --> 02:53:23.320]  Now, 27 years later, Carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:53:23.320 --> 02:53:28.380]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally
[02:53:28.380 --> 02:53:33.520]  occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single
[02:53:33.520 --> 02:53:34.680]  normal cell.
[02:53:34.680 --> 02:53:38.440]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune
[02:53:38.440 --> 02:53:42.400]  cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:53:42.400 --> 02:53:50.320]  Call 1-866-VenusFly or order from Carnivora.com, that's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[02:53:50.320 --> 02:53:57.700]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VenusFly or visit Carnivora.com.
[02:53:57.700 --> 02:54:11.600]  That's your immune system, it's the only one you've got.
[02:54:11.600 --> 02:54:24.800]  Yeah, folks, the film Genetic Roulette was 2012 movie of the year, Solari Report, transformational
[02:54:24.800 --> 02:54:30.920]  film of the year, Aware Guide, and again, it's available at Infowarsstore.com, and yeah,
[02:54:30.920 --> 02:54:36.280]  you support us getting the word out, you support what he's doing, what we're doing, but really
[02:54:36.280 --> 02:54:40.840]  it's about waking up, because you need to take this personal, myself included.
[02:54:40.840 --> 02:54:45.460]  Every time I do one of these interviews, I think, you know all this, but you still go
[02:54:45.460 --> 02:54:48.300]  in a restaurant and don't even ask, is this organic?
[02:54:48.300 --> 02:54:52.600]  And by demanding that, it will then create the market and then it will displace it, just
[02:54:52.600 --> 02:54:57.840]  like you can't even find non-GMO milk now, or hormone milk, it's all organic everywhere
[02:54:57.840 --> 02:55:04.280]  I go around the country, because people, unless it's a low income area at a gas station, and
[02:55:04.280 --> 02:55:10.100]  that's really the exciting thing, we demand quality, we demand service, we demand transparency,
[02:55:10.100 --> 02:55:16.280]  it doesn't matter how many lawyers in government Monsanto has, it doesn't matter how many people
[02:55:16.280 --> 02:55:20.720]  they own, and this is just basic self-preservation, and by the way, I've researched it, these
[02:55:20.720 --> 02:55:27.080]  are eugenicist folks, they know exactly what they're doing, it's not just Monsanto, and
[02:55:27.080 --> 02:55:31.800]  I look at the rat photos, type in GMO rat photos, if you dare, and look at the studies,
[02:55:31.800 --> 02:55:35.560]  and I've had top scientists on, countless times, you've heard them, that were like making
[02:55:35.560 --> 02:55:41.160]  millions of years, GMO scientists, had patents, were working with these really big companies,
[02:55:41.160 --> 02:55:45.480]  and then found out it was sterilizing lab animals and things, and so they would just
[02:55:45.480 --> 02:55:49.560]  refuse to be part of it anymore, and then be demonized and attacked, but they've been
[02:55:49.560 --> 02:55:50.560]  vindicated.
[02:55:50.560 --> 02:55:55.600]  I mean, what's the point spending all this money of your grandkids, you know, get cancer?
[02:55:55.600 --> 02:55:58.840]  And by the way, Jeffrey Smith, you haven't even gotten into what happens by the second
[02:55:58.840 --> 02:56:05.520]  and third generation in guinea pigs and rats, when they're fed different GMO diets, tell
[02:56:05.520 --> 02:56:12.920]  people about that briefly, and what the studies show the worst linked GMO things are, I mean,
[02:56:12.920 --> 02:56:16.120]  is it the pesticide based BT things?
[02:56:16.120 --> 02:56:21.960]  Well, as far as the multiple generations go, there was a study not yet published, but we
[02:56:21.960 --> 02:56:28.840]  did announce the results when the Moscow scientists did report them, and that is when they fed
[02:56:28.840 --> 02:56:36.080]  hamsters genetically modified soybeans, by the third generation, most were sterile.
[02:56:36.080 --> 02:56:40.800]  They also died at four or five times the rate compared to controls that were eating the
[02:56:40.800 --> 02:56:46.400]  non-GM soybeans, and many of the hamsters had hair growing in their mouths.
[02:56:46.400 --> 02:56:52.440]  Now, hair growing in the mouths is not something that's common at all, it's extremely rare,
[02:56:52.440 --> 02:56:53.440]  but they had never-
[02:56:53.440 --> 02:56:56.160]  Well, his Skype broke up.
[02:56:56.160 --> 02:56:58.840]  As they had with the GMO fed groups.
[02:56:58.840 --> 02:57:02.080]  Sorry, your Skype broke up for a moment.
[02:57:02.080 --> 02:57:04.200]  Why are you discriminating against people with hair in their mouths?
[02:57:04.200 --> 02:57:06.640]  I mean, maybe that's a gift the government's gonna give us.
[02:57:06.640 --> 02:57:09.700]  Well, it's true, you never know.
[02:57:09.700 --> 02:57:13.620]  One thing, though, about this time, I'm thinking some of your listeners may wanna know how
[02:57:13.620 --> 02:57:15.320]  to avoid GMOs.
[02:57:15.320 --> 02:57:17.400]  Shall we give them a little primer on that?
[02:57:17.400 --> 02:57:18.400]  Yes.
[02:57:18.400 --> 02:57:21.840]  Okay, there are nine genetically modified food crops.
[02:57:21.840 --> 02:57:29.120]  They are soy, corn, cottonseed oil, canola oil, sugar from sugar beets, alfalfa, which
[02:57:29.120 --> 02:57:31.640]  is used as hay for animals.
[02:57:31.640 --> 02:57:36.380]  There's zucchini and yellow crookneck squash, not all of it, but some of it, as well as
[02:57:36.380 --> 02:57:38.880]  papaya from either Hawaii or China.
[02:57:38.880 --> 02:57:45.520]  Now, all of these are found at non-GMOshoppingguide.com or in the free download iPhone application
[02:57:45.520 --> 02:57:47.360]  ShopNoGMO.
[02:57:47.360 --> 02:57:53.020]  We also have about 10,000 products listed in the guide that are third-party verified
[02:57:53.020 --> 02:57:54.660]  as non-GMO.
[02:57:54.660 --> 02:57:57.120]  Here are the four ways to avoid GMOs.
[02:57:57.120 --> 02:58:00.960]  One, buy organic, not allowed to intentionally use GMOs.
[02:58:00.960 --> 02:58:04.600]  Two, buy products that say non-GMO on the package.
[02:58:04.600 --> 02:58:10.720]  Three, buy products listed in our shopping guide, or four, avoid the at-risk ingredients.
[02:58:10.720 --> 02:58:15.920]  Now, we mentioned nine GM food crops, but some of these have derivatives like dextrose
[02:58:15.920 --> 02:58:17.960]  and maltodextrin, etc.
[02:58:17.960 --> 02:58:22.720]  Those derivatives are also listed on the guide, and you can find, even in the processed food
[02:58:22.720 --> 02:58:28.960]  sections in major supermarkets, products that don't have these derivatives from GMOs either.
[02:58:28.960 --> 02:58:29.960]  All right, we're out of time.
[02:58:29.960 --> 02:58:30.960]  We gotta talk to you again soon.
[02:58:30.960 --> 02:58:32.680]  I'm gonna do some overdrive to take calls.
[02:58:32.680 --> 02:58:33.920]  Thank you so much, Mr. Smith.
[02:58:33.920 --> 02:58:34.920]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:58:34.920 --> 02:58:40.280]  By the way, big breaking news at Infowars.com right now on IRSgate and more.
[02:58:40.280 --> 02:58:44.720]  Thank you for listening to GCN.

[02:59:52.760 --> 03:00:06.000]  Public Coast, direct from Austin, you're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:06.000 --> 03:00:10.840]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:10.840 --> 03:00:11.840]  You want answers?
[03:00:11.840 --> 03:00:13.960]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.960 --> 03:00:23.000]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network, and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:23.000 --> 03:00:27.080]  Mitch McConnell, Republican leader in the Senate, saying this is only the beginning.
[03:00:27.080 --> 03:00:35.560]  A lot more is about to come out on IRS gate, spying gate, Benghazi gate, everything else.
[03:00:35.560 --> 03:00:38.280]  Report IRS targeted news anchor after Obama interview.
[03:00:38.280 --> 03:00:42.680]  The guy asked mild questions of Obama, and his family said that IRS is going to come
[03:00:42.680 --> 03:00:45.600]  after you, that's how well-known it is, and they did.
[03:00:45.600 --> 03:00:51.440]  Special unit went after pro-Israel Jewish groups, that's bizarre.
[03:00:51.440 --> 03:00:57.000]  Agency won't say if it will comply with the congressional demand for all the documents.
[03:00:57.000 --> 03:01:01.000]  People were aware of conservatives being targeted but didn't do anything, that's the White House.
[03:01:01.000 --> 03:01:04.320]  Yeah, the media is all a bunch of crooks, man, they love it.
[03:01:04.320 --> 03:01:10.120]  Top IRS official, mistakes were made, guilty of lack of sensitivity.
[03:01:10.120 --> 03:01:16.800]  Knew of Tea Party targeting for years, but for a year, but didn't reveal, and AP is angry
[03:01:16.800 --> 03:01:17.800]  and disbelief.
[03:01:17.800 --> 03:01:21.240]  I mean, you guys play ball with the New World Order, you know who you work for, and there's
[03:01:21.240 --> 03:01:26.880]  our article right there on DrudgeReport.com, Rand Paul, Obama drunk on power.
[03:01:26.880 --> 03:01:30.120]  Maybe they'll attack him for saying that.
[03:01:30.120 --> 03:01:37.320]  That's just some of what's up on DrudgeReport.com, and then we've got all the stuff up on InfoWars.com.
[03:01:37.320 --> 03:01:42.240]  It's all just out of control, but let's get to some of your phone calls, as promised.
[03:01:42.240 --> 03:01:47.280]  Let's talk to Joshua, because he's 19 years old, concerned with the youth of America.
[03:01:47.280 --> 03:01:49.400]  I'm concerned with everybody, my friend, we're all in trouble.
[03:01:49.400 --> 03:01:50.400]  Go ahead.
[03:01:50.400 --> 03:01:55.840]  Yes, I'm talking about the youth, some of us were actually gamers, and it's actually
[03:01:55.840 --> 03:01:57.720]  one of my hobbies.
[03:01:57.720 --> 03:02:04.240]  I'm disabled, 19, not able to work, actually, and a lot of the people that are plugged in
[03:02:04.240 --> 03:02:08.840]  that just play Call of Duty all day, they're actually a joke to some of the more serious
[03:02:08.840 --> 03:02:16.240]  gamers, because they don't really expand their horizons with other games and whatnot, but
[03:02:16.240 --> 03:02:19.240]  I want to thank you.
[03:02:19.240 --> 03:02:21.760]  You're the one reason why I'm awake.
[03:02:21.760 --> 03:02:24.480]  Five years ago, I started listening to your show.
[03:02:24.480 --> 03:02:25.480]  You woke me up.
[03:02:25.480 --> 03:02:32.600]  When I tell people about your show and stuff you talk about, GMOs, for instance, they think
[03:02:32.600 --> 03:02:33.600]  that I'm crazy.
[03:02:33.600 --> 03:02:39.280]  They look at me with this glazed-over look in their eyes, and it really makes me sad.
[03:02:39.280 --> 03:02:46.640]  But the people of my generation, they are asleep, they're on their phones all the time,
[03:02:46.640 --> 03:02:50.120]  they don't really want to pay attention to what's going on around them.
[03:02:50.120 --> 03:02:56.780]  They're not living, they're not living, they're sleeping, plugged into the fake world of mainstream
[03:02:56.780 --> 03:02:57.780]  media.
[03:02:57.780 --> 03:03:02.760]  And it's time for all of us to pull back more and more, and at least one day a week, so
[03:03:02.760 --> 03:03:05.040]  biblical, unplugged from everything.
[03:03:05.040 --> 03:03:09.920]  And our children, it's rewiring their brains early in a bad way.
[03:03:09.920 --> 03:03:14.640]  We need to keep kids off the computers as much as possible.
[03:03:14.640 --> 03:03:19.960]  And when people are on the computers, they have the information at their fingertips.
[03:03:19.960 --> 03:03:25.080]  They have an entire world of information at their fingertips, but do they use it?
[03:03:25.080 --> 03:03:26.080]  No, they don't.
[03:03:26.080 --> 03:03:27.080]  That's another thing.
[03:03:27.080 --> 03:03:28.080]  Exactly.
[03:03:28.080 --> 03:03:29.080]  The internet could be used for good.
[03:03:29.080 --> 03:03:30.160]  I think we're one of the good influences there.
[03:03:30.160 --> 03:03:32.160]  There's many others.
[03:03:32.160 --> 03:03:37.040]  But yeah, I use it to try to learn things, check things, find things out, share things.
[03:03:37.040 --> 03:03:42.040]  The mainstream culture is designed to dumb us down and make us weak so we can be conquered.
[03:03:42.040 --> 03:03:43.840]  I mean, that's on record.
[03:03:43.840 --> 03:03:49.760]  And so all I can say is, children don't know how to discern and discriminate, so we need
[03:03:49.760 --> 03:03:52.040]  to basically keep them off the internet as much as possible.
[03:03:52.040 --> 03:03:55.440]  I mean, parents, you can't just turn your kids over to the government and the globalist
[03:03:55.440 --> 03:03:56.440]  media.
[03:03:56.440 --> 03:04:00.960]  God bless you, Joshua, I appreciate your call and joining us today.
[03:04:00.960 --> 03:04:01.960]  I'm out of time.
[03:04:01.960 --> 03:04:06.760]  Ernest, Anthony, Shelley, if you want to give us your numbers, we'll call you back tomorrow
[03:04:06.760 --> 03:04:07.760]  and get you on.
[03:04:07.760 --> 03:04:08.880]  I'll actually do that.
[03:04:08.880 --> 03:04:11.800]  Most hosts don't do that, but I apologize.
[03:04:11.800 --> 03:04:15.840]  I feel terrible every day when I sit there and say, I'll take calls and don't get to
[03:04:15.840 --> 03:04:16.840]  as many as I'd like.
[03:04:16.840 --> 03:04:17.840]  I did an okay job today.
[03:04:17.840 --> 03:04:18.840]  We probably took 15 calls.
[03:04:18.840 --> 03:04:23.720]  I mean, not at first on talk radio, in fact, I could take 60 calls in an hour because I
[03:04:23.720 --> 03:04:24.720]  was into taking the calls.
[03:04:24.720 --> 03:04:29.000]  I would just take them and take them and take them, and now it's the opposite.
[03:04:29.000 --> 03:04:30.000]  I don't know why I do that.
[03:04:30.000 --> 03:04:32.080]  I think it's almost a subconscious thing.
[03:04:32.080 --> 03:04:33.080]  It's like being interrogated.
[03:04:33.080 --> 03:04:35.880]  I don't know what you're going to come up with and I'll have to think about it.
[03:04:35.880 --> 03:04:38.560]  And so it's almost like I don't cover these big stacks of news I've already looked at
[03:04:38.560 --> 03:04:41.920]  because it's like, new world order.
[03:04:41.920 --> 03:04:44.360]  It's almost like I don't want to face all this stuff.
[03:04:44.360 --> 03:04:45.360]  You know what I mean?
[03:04:45.360 --> 03:04:50.800]  That's why I don't blame you out there for wanting to stick your head in the sand sometime.
[03:04:50.800 --> 03:04:52.240]  But that won't save us.
[03:04:52.240 --> 03:04:56.240]  We've got to stand up against these globalists and we'll cover it all tonight.
[03:04:56.240 --> 03:05:00.040]  7 o'clock Central in Fall Wars Nightly News, get a membership at prisonplanet.tv.
