[00:00:05.092 --> 00:00:06.393]  Big Brother.
[00:00:06.393 --> 00:00:08.174]  Mainstream media.
[00:00:08.174 --> 00:00:09.935]  Government cover-ups.
[00:00:09.935 --> 00:00:11.516]  You want answers?
[00:00:11.516 --> 00:00:13.057]  Well, so does he.
[00:00:13.057 --> 00:00:17.260]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.363]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:53.705]  Ladies and gentlemen, the son of Watergate, chillin' like a villain, Barack Hussein Obama is melting down, as I said we were seeing last week.
[00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:59.348]  And yes, he's a globalist puppet, but all the hopes and dreams to sell tyranny
[00:01:00.308 --> 00:01:11.151]  And to sell war and torture and secret spying and political persecution as trendy is now falling on its face.
[00:01:11.151 --> 00:01:22.053]  When you see the establishment turn against somebody, it's because they realize he can't sell their agenda anymore and they're losing massive credibility because of him.
[00:01:22.053 --> 00:01:25.314]  But all I can say is, too late!
[00:01:25.314 --> 00:01:28.875]  You're not going to put a Republican puppet in there either and have us go back to sleep.
[00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:45.938]  That's why, despite the mainstream media demonizing him, Rand Paul, Ted Cruz, people like that are so incredibly popular now across the political spectrum, is because people want constitutionalists.
[00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:50.600]  They want people that support the Bill of Rights, the Constitution, due process.
[00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.042]  People hunger for checks and balances.
[00:01:55.826 --> 00:02:04.037]  And the fact that now it's come out in AP, Reuters, Washington Post, what we told you years ago, it came out years ago.
[00:02:05.302 --> 00:02:09.165]  That they were targeting and auditing and harassing Tea Party people.
[00:02:09.165 --> 00:02:14.330]  We have an article up on Infowars.com dealing with that, how it was a conspiracy.
[00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.711]  Leaked documents.
[00:02:15.711 --> 00:02:19.434]  IRS targeting conservatives in what media called conspiracy.
[00:02:19.434 --> 00:02:27.081]  And we have links to our articles and other articles from three years ago and two years ago saying exactly what is now being reported.
[00:02:29.437 --> 00:02:33.821]  In fact, they're now linking in the media to older articles where it's actually been mentioned.
[00:02:33.821 --> 00:02:49.017]  It's kind of like Fast and Furious, where Big Sis and Holder and all these people at the criminal and justice department, they, if you remember,
[00:02:50.956 --> 00:02:54.739]  Came out like six months in office and said, we need to get the guns, because there's a crowd in Mexico.
[00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:57.401]  And we've got an Operation Gun Runner tracking the guns.
[00:02:57.401 --> 00:02:59.403]  And then later they're like, we've never heard of Gun Runner.
[00:02:59.403 --> 00:03:01.184]  We've never heard of Fast and Furious.
[00:03:01.184 --> 00:03:01.845]  Why?
[00:03:01.845 --> 00:03:02.526]  It's not true.
[00:03:02.526 --> 00:03:03.747]  We didn't know.
[00:03:03.747 --> 00:03:04.807]  We didn't mean.
[00:03:04.807 --> 00:03:08.330]  And then, of course, the memos came out that were planning to use it to blame the Second Amendment.
[00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.992]  This stuff is all hiding in plain view.
[00:03:10.992 --> 00:03:15.096]  So why now is everybody from Jon Stewart,
[00:03:16.536 --> 00:03:27.078]  To John McCain, all these establishment people, why are they now turning on the precious and darling little Obama?
[00:03:27.078 --> 00:03:30.919]  Because they want to blame the failure in Syria on him.
[00:03:30.919 --> 00:03:36.060]  They want to blame the failure to get Obamacare properly implemented on him.
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.701]  It's never designed to be implemented.
[00:03:37.701 --> 00:03:43.162]  It's designed to rob people and make Berkshire Hathaway's stock increase in value because it makes you buy insurance from him.
[00:03:45.812 --> 00:03:58.599]  Their whole system is really waking people up, so they hope that they can just destroy Obama now, if not actually indict him in the House, convict him in the Senate impeachment.
[00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:14.907]  They're hoping that if they destroy him politically, that will satisfy people, like throwing someone into the mob to be torn apart, or throwing someone to the wolves that are tracking you through the woods, giving the dog a bone.
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.981]  Now, let's be clear here.
[00:04:17.981 --> 00:04:20.804]  I am very excited about Obama being brought to justice.
[00:04:20.804 --> 00:04:21.704]  I'm very excited.
[00:04:21.704 --> 00:04:23.005]  I'd like to see them all go to jail.
[00:04:23.005 --> 00:04:27.169]  And I think it's important to punish corrupt politicians.
[00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:35.655]  But I don't want to settle the Republicans who are scared of too deep an investigation.
[00:04:35.655 --> 00:04:39.158]  Breaking through compartments into their corruption.
[00:04:39.158 --> 00:04:44.663]  I'm concerned they'll try to just make Hillary step down and some type of public censure of Obama.
[00:04:45.888 --> 00:04:47.909]  We need more than that.
[00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:53.151]  And we can crowbar into this space and bust the New World Order wide open.
[00:04:53.151 --> 00:04:56.893]  If we seize on something like this, it could be their Waterloo.
[00:05:00.825 --> 00:05:01.205]  Hello.
[00:05:01.205 --> 00:05:03.146]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[00:05:03.146 --> 00:05:05.546]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[00:05:05.546 --> 00:05:11.008]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[00:05:11.008 --> 00:05:15.069]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[00:05:15.069 --> 00:05:18.990]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:20.390]  The fact is, you are.
[00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.390]  We all are.
[00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:23.731]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[00:05:24.051 --> 00:05:32.617]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.
[00:05:32.617 --> 00:05:33.998]  Be prepared before you need it.
[00:05:33.998 --> 00:05:37.460]  With nutrient-dense food you can store for up to 25 years.
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.862]  You can hope for the best, but hope won't feed you.
[00:05:39.862 --> 00:05:44.425]  Do what I've done and get your own supply of the best storable foods out there from eFoodsDirect.

[00:06:01.874 --> 00:06:07.717]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[00:06:08.624 --> 00:06:15.368]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.

[00:06:30.475 --> 00:06:36.659]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[00:06:37.379 --> 00:06:48.645]  But rather we have formulated our silver gel using the natural skin nourishing chemistry of aloe vera to quickly penetrate and nourish the skin while delivering the silver more effectively.

[00:07:01.482 --> 00:07:13.107]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support your immune system.
[00:07:13.107 --> 00:07:26.333]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary new silver solution that is clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver, and is powerful enough to help protect you and your family.
[00:07:26.333 --> 00:07:30.335]  Supernatural Silver is scientifically supported, highly effective,
[00:07:30.555 --> 00:07:34.057]  And perfect for everyday use inside the body as well as out.
[00:07:34.057 --> 00:07:35.678]  The Science Digest Journal says,
[00:08:16.580 --> 00:08:17.761]  Big Brother.
[00:08:17.761 --> 00:08:19.621]  Mainstream Media.
[00:08:19.621 --> 00:08:21.222]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:21.222 --> 00:08:22.802]  You want answers?
[00:08:22.802 --> 00:08:24.443]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:24.443 --> 00:08:28.124]  It's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:32.552 --> 00:08:41.274]  Coming to you live from the Infowars News Center in Austin, Texas, radiating out across the entire globe.
[00:08:41.274 --> 00:08:55.498]  It is Tuesday, the 14th day of May 2013, and we're going to be live here, Lord willing, for the next three hours.
[00:08:55.498 --> 00:08:57.199]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, here's what I want to do.
[00:08:58.442 --> 00:09:00.884]  I'm going to really try to control myself, which you know I won't.
[00:09:00.884 --> 00:09:11.130]  I'm going to try to hit the unraveling of the Obama administration, the Bozo administration, drunk on power, as Senator Rand Paul has said.
[00:09:11.130 --> 00:09:13.871]  You can watch that video up at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:09:13.871 --> 00:09:16.553]  They have a link to it right there in the middle column.
[00:09:16.553 --> 00:09:21.556]  We're going to be playing some of that audio for radio listeners here in the next segment.
[00:09:21.556 --> 00:09:26.519]  But I want to give the phone number out today specifically
[00:09:27.808 --> 00:09:44.438]  Again, for first-time callers, that means real first-time callers that have never had a chance to get through, to give us your take on why you think the bottom is falling out on Obama, why you think the establishment is turning against him, and how far you think this will go.
[00:09:44.438 --> 00:09:51.102]  I think most of it, in fact I know most of that, depends on what we politically do.
[00:09:51.102 --> 00:09:54.544]  And it is very healthy.
[00:09:54.544 --> 00:09:56.646]  It shows that these people are not above the law.
[00:09:58.218 --> 00:10:06.387]  It is what is constitutional that Obama be indicted in the House and convicted in the Senate.
[00:10:06.387 --> 00:10:15.198]  And quite frankly, he shouldn't sail off at the sunset like Nixon, who said, I'm not a crook, I don't know anything about Watergate, the hotel, the break-in.
[00:10:16.150 --> 00:10:19.693]  And, well now we're seeing the same thing out of Obama.
[00:10:19.693 --> 00:10:21.154]  I didn't know about Benghazi.
[00:10:21.154 --> 00:10:24.377]  I didn't know about the IRS spying on people and harassing them.
[00:10:24.377 --> 00:10:27.159]  I didn't know about the AP and other media being spied on.
[00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:29.041]  You didn't know?
[00:10:29.041 --> 00:10:42.572]  It's on record that Obama has had, I've seen numbers of 15 times, 20 times, no one knows, the prosecution of whistleblowers at the federal level for reporting on corruption to the media.
[00:10:43.564 --> 00:10:47.068]  There are scores of people serving prison sentences.
[00:10:47.068 --> 00:10:55.758]  We've had corrupt presidents before, we've had a corrupt establishment, but we've never had a persecution of the lapdog media like we're now seeing.
[00:10:57.688 --> 00:11:18.817]  And so there's a lot of things happening, but I think the over-the-topness of the corruption, of the reporters having to submit their questions before press conferences, not just for presidential press conferences, but for federal press conferences across the board, the scripting of everything, the fraud, the arrogance,
[00:11:19.798 --> 00:11:28.476]  The White House saying we may just stop having press conferences and we'll maybe have a hologram president literally come out and make announcements.
[00:11:32.196 --> 00:11:39.682]  They have been caught across the board lying and they've lost the people's confidence.
[00:11:39.682 --> 00:11:46.388]  Now, if Obama just gets a political spanking and this becomes a political diversion, it's a big loss for liberty.
[00:11:46.388 --> 00:11:58.558]  But you can smell that kind of visceral, electric, ozone stench of fear and running.
[00:12:00.876 --> 00:12:03.960]  Trampling from the establishment.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:09.807]  They are scared across the board because globally the currencies are melting down.
[00:12:09.807 --> 00:12:15.014]  We've been in a depression for five years in most sectors of the economy.
[00:12:15.014 --> 00:12:19.319]  By every old-fashioned benchmark, they're cooking the modern numbers.
[00:12:21.192 --> 00:12:25.474]  Government is giving itself red carpet treatment.
[00:12:25.474 --> 00:12:29.016]  A million dollars a day for Obama to go on vacation.
[00:12:29.016 --> 00:12:31.557]  Half a million a day for Biden.
[00:12:31.557 --> 00:12:32.857]  But it's not just here in the US.
[00:12:32.857 --> 00:12:34.838]  People are angry about this in England.
[00:12:34.838 --> 00:12:36.319]  They're angry about it all over the UK.
[00:12:36.319 --> 00:12:37.340]  They're angry about it in Israel.
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.041]  They're angry about it in Europe.
[00:12:40.041 --> 00:12:41.662]  They're angry about it in Russia.
[00:12:41.662 --> 00:12:55.209]  People are sick of it and they now see through the fancy ties and the sports jackets and the Air Force Ones and the Hollywoodization of everything.
[00:12:55.209 --> 00:13:07.115]  People are really getting nauseous from the intoxication of lies and they're ready to hug the toilet and get the poison out of them.
[00:13:08.123 --> 00:13:11.649]  Now, the question is, will we be able to get to that point?
[00:13:11.649 --> 00:13:13.492]  I certainly hope so.
[00:13:13.492 --> 00:13:14.194]  So let me do this.
[00:13:14.194 --> 00:13:16.037]  Let me go over the headlines here.
[00:13:17.085 --> 00:13:33.778]  I'm going to give the phone number out, and I really do want to take calls this hour and the next hour, and then we're going to have top researcher on Monsanto and GMO to cover that big fight, Jeffrey Smith, covering some of the Supreme Court rulings and things that have been coming down the last few days, and the March on Monsanto nationwide coming up.
[00:13:33.778 --> 00:13:38.362]  We're going to have him pop in for about 30-40 minutes at the start of the third hour.
[00:13:39.824 --> 00:13:45.550]  We've also got Dr. Kermit Gosnell found guilty of murdering infants in late-term abortions.
[00:13:45.550 --> 00:13:48.933]  We're going to be giving you the details on those counts.
[00:13:48.933 --> 00:13:54.959]  And they said what pushed the jury over the edge was the filthiness of the grimy clinic.
[00:13:56.527 --> 00:13:57.348]  That's a quote.
[00:13:57.348 --> 00:13:59.211]  The filthy, grimy clinic.
[00:13:59.211 --> 00:14:11.086]  So it would have been okay if it was all glistening white and clean, and if he hadn't made jokes about babies and killing them and how much he enjoyed it, there wouldn't have been all the witnesses about them, you know, babies swimming in toilets.
[00:14:12.427 --> 00:14:19.073]  If he would have done it in a professional manner, it's like, oh, we torture, but it's professional.
[00:14:19.073 --> 00:14:22.597]  Oh, we spy on you, but it's done by professionals.
[00:14:22.597 --> 00:14:28.142]  I always notice they go, it's very professional at Abu Ghraib raping the children in front of their parents.
[00:14:28.142 --> 00:14:30.684]  It's very professional.
[00:14:30.684 --> 00:14:37.271]  I've said if Hitler wore a pink uniform, we probably never would have, even when he declared war on us, fought back.
[00:14:39.366 --> 00:15:02.804]  As long as you act non-threatening like Google and Berkshire Hathaway and Warren Buffett and all these crooks, they are crooks, you know, getting $44 billion of bailout money after you give political money to people that make the decision at the Treasury to then give $44 billion to you, it's hundreds of billions now, that's criminal.
[00:15:02.804 --> 00:15:06.607]  Google breaking into everybody's computers, hacking past with government
[00:15:07.466 --> 00:15:11.848]  Backdoors they were given to steal your passcodes and everything and spying on you.
[00:15:11.848 --> 00:15:15.991]  They've been convicted of that, but were given a slap on the wrist.
[00:15:15.991 --> 00:15:18.392]  That's criminal.
[00:15:18.392 --> 00:15:23.795]  But see, they don't dress... In the old days, people liked somebody dressed up in a black uniform acting tough.
[00:15:24.807 --> 00:15:39.178]  You know, that was seen as a strong leader, so people like Hitler and Mao and Stalin would stomp around and say, I'm coming to kill you, and that would kind of scare and awe their minions, because they would see projected power through the leader.
[00:15:39.178 --> 00:15:40.939]  But nowadays, they're more sophisticated.
[00:15:40.939 --> 00:15:45.742]  They walk around with a metrosexual lisp and all of this.
[00:15:45.742 --> 00:15:47.644]  That's a complete cover, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:15:49.377 --> 00:15:53.260]  Because they can get everything as long as they go, I'm liberal!
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:55.421]  I'm a peace prize winner!
[00:15:55.421 --> 00:16:06.128]  We have video up on Infowars.com of a Syrian rebel group cutting a guy's heart out and eating it.
[00:16:08.246 --> 00:16:20.776]  And these are the groups, but even in the British news, the public is now outraged, the BBC reports, over the fact that, quote, the West is funding Al-Qaeda.
[00:16:20.776 --> 00:16:22.938]  See, that's another reason Obama's in so much trouble.
[00:16:22.938 --> 00:16:24.979]  They've got to burn somebody for this.
[00:16:24.979 --> 00:16:37.109]  This is a larger global policy to create radical jihadis, to fund radical Muslims, and then to allow them to attack or to provocateur them into attacks.
[00:16:39.048 --> 00:16:40.128]  This is all on record.
[00:16:40.128 --> 00:16:47.151]  So see, that realization, that realization is now coming to the forefront of people's minds.
[00:16:47.151 --> 00:16:49.632]  And there's a total loss of credibility.
[00:16:49.632 --> 00:17:03.558]  Last night, I don't go out late very often, but I went out and heard some amazing rockabilly music at a dive bar in East Austin with Hank Hill and Beavis and Butthead.
[00:17:03.558 --> 00:17:05.499]  I was hanging out with all of them.
[00:17:05.499 --> 00:17:06.799]  Literally, Mike Judge.
[00:17:06.799 --> 00:17:07.740]  What a cool guy, man.
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:08.400]  He is something else.
[00:17:09.196 --> 00:17:11.703]  And it went on for about five hours.
[00:17:11.703 --> 00:17:16.355]  And I talked to countless people who were listeners.
[00:17:17.948 --> 00:17:20.709]  Uh, who said, man, it's all coming out.
[00:17:20.709 --> 00:17:24.110]  And everybody I talked to says they're now waking up.
[00:17:24.110 --> 00:17:27.330]  And wow, your show's almost passe now.
[00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:30.771]  Just a few years ago, you were saying they're spying on you without warrants.
[00:17:30.771 --> 00:17:31.831]  And oh, they'd never do that.
[00:17:31.831 --> 00:17:33.552]  You know, that's a police state.
[00:17:33.552 --> 00:17:38.893]  And again, I'm not bragging that I'm out in Austin and people are coming up saying, hey, you know, people are waking up.
[00:17:38.893 --> 00:17:40.613]  I'm bragging that they're waking up.
[00:17:40.613 --> 00:17:42.934]  I'm giving you a good report.
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:56.127]  Because people now really get that they're sinister forces and that we better get back to what made America great, keeping government on a very, very short leash.
[00:17:56.127 --> 00:18:04.153]  Very, very, very, very short leash.
[00:18:04.153 --> 00:18:06.555]  I tell you, I needed it to blow some steam off.
[00:18:06.555 --> 00:18:09.297]  I really love good rockabilly music.
[00:18:09.297 --> 00:18:10.277]  It was great stuff.
[00:18:10.277 --> 00:18:12.479]  I was listening to it last night.
[00:18:14.130 --> 00:18:14.830]  Really enjoyable.
[00:18:14.830 --> 00:18:15.911]  Man, that's great live music.
[00:18:15.911 --> 00:18:20.614]  I think I'm going to go out and see Weldon Henson Wednesday night.
[00:18:20.614 --> 00:18:22.596]  It's his drummer that was in this other band.
[00:18:22.596 --> 00:18:24.557]  He's also in the Derailers.
[00:18:24.557 --> 00:18:26.858]  Man, it was good.
[00:18:26.858 --> 00:18:29.980]  You know what I'm going to do?
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.842]  I'm going to go to break.
[00:18:31.842 --> 00:18:35.284]  I'm going to reset and untangle my mind.
[00:18:35.284 --> 00:18:38.406]  And then we are going to
[00:18:41.752 --> 00:18:48.833]  Get into all the different gates, the son of Watergate as it's being called by Drudge, up at DrudgeReport.com.
[00:18:48.833 --> 00:18:53.274]  It's also all up at Infowars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[00:18:53.274 --> 00:18:58.075]  Paul Joseph Watson has an article, Liberals Defend Obama for Spying on Media.
[00:18:58.075 --> 00:19:06.577]  At first it wasn't happening and now the White House connected and run groups, I mean it's literally White House groups, are coming out saying it's no big deal.
[00:19:07.674 --> 00:19:09.935]  No big deal, you know.
[00:19:09.935 --> 00:19:11.155]  Nothing to worry about, Mr. Goffer.
[00:19:11.155 --> 00:19:13.136]  Not a plastic explosive or anything.
[00:19:13.136 --> 00:19:14.977]  Nothing to worry about.
[00:19:14.977 --> 00:19:19.339]  And then we've got CIA cannibal eats dead Syrian soldiers heart.
[00:19:19.339 --> 00:19:23.521]  Rand Paul AP phone spying proves Obama is drunk on power.
[00:19:23.521 --> 00:19:24.801]  That clip's coming up.
[00:19:24.801 --> 00:19:28.143]  Judge says assume all communications are being monitored.
[00:19:28.143 --> 00:19:33.165]  The White House says it had no idea the DOJ sees the AP's phone records.
[00:19:34.418 --> 00:19:40.183]  Same IRS that targeted conservatives will demand your private health insurance records.
[00:19:40.183 --> 00:19:45.507]  Leaked docs, IRS targeting conservatives in what media called conspiracy.
[00:19:45.507 --> 00:19:49.531]  And I haven't even gotten into the... I'm gonna cover it all when we come back, but here's the toll-free number.
[00:19:50.111 --> 00:19:52.132]  I want to hear what you think about all this.
[00:19:52.132 --> 00:19:52.612]  800-259-9231.
[00:19:52.612 --> 00:19:53.792]  That's 800-259-9231.
[00:19:53.792 --> 00:19:58.014]  Strap yourselves in.
[00:19:58.014 --> 00:20:02.975]  It's time for a home security quiz.
[00:20:02.975 --> 00:20:15.980]  What effective home security device is smaller than a coffee cup, fakes out burglars into thinking someone is home at your house while you're away, plugs into any wall outlet, is recommended by many police departments, and sells for less than $30?
[00:20:17.040 --> 00:20:18.960]  Yes, it's fake TV.
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:21.161]  This year, about one in every 50 U.S.
[00:20:21.161 --> 00:20:27.583]  homes will have a break-in with burglars usually picking the easy target, a dark house that looks like no one is home.
[00:20:27.583 --> 00:20:36.165]  Fake TV is a small electronic security device that makes it look like someone is home watching TV by simulating the light from a real TV.
[00:20:36.165 --> 00:20:41.626]  Fake TV could be the difference between coming home to a secure house or one that's been ransacked.
[00:20:41.866 --> 00:20:48.834]  To get your FAKE TV for only $29.95 with free shipping, go to FAKETV.com or call 1-877-5-FAKE-TV.

[00:20:49.815 --> 00:20:51.958]  FAKE TV, the burglar deterrent.
[00:21:00.407 --> 00:21:03.628]  If you're going to have a bunker, why not have an Ultimate Bunker?
[00:21:03.628 --> 00:21:11.030]  In case of pandemic outbreak, civil unrest, biological or nuclear fallout, or EMP attacks, stay safe in your own Ultimate Bunker.

[00:21:30.217 --> 00:21:31.437]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[00:21:31.437 --> 00:21:35.919]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[00:21:35.919 --> 00:21:41.641]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[00:21:41.641 --> 00:21:45.222]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.
[00:21:45.222 --> 00:21:47.903]  If you would like to have gold for your retirement, call 800-686-2237.

[00:22:06.828 --> 00:22:09.089]  Threats that trample the American dream.

[00:22:10.990 --> 00:22:14.853]  A crashing economy that's forcing millions out of work and from their homes.
[00:22:14.853 --> 00:22:17.875]  Half of Americans need help just to feed themselves.
[00:22:17.875 --> 00:22:21.617]  Legalized pollution of our food is sickening us with cancer and disease.
[00:22:21.617 --> 00:22:25.880]  The food you can trust in facing any of these threats comes from eFoods Direct.

[00:23:05.197 --> 00:23:06.658]  We need assistance.

[00:23:07.479 --> 00:23:11.062]  Those we should be able to depend on let us down.
[00:23:11.062 --> 00:23:17.466]  Federal and state and local officials saying help is on the way, while the folks here in Bell Harbor say show me.
[00:23:17.466 --> 00:23:19.988]  Don't depend on the government to save you.
[00:23:19.988 --> 00:23:20.969]  Take action now.

[00:23:47.129 --> 00:23:51.911]  Before it's time to survive, it's time to prepare.
[00:23:51.911 --> 00:24:05.098]  MyPatriotSupply.com MyPatriotSupply.com Day after day, alone on a hill
[00:24:09.850 --> 00:24:11.351]  A man with a foolish grin.
[00:24:30.939 --> 00:24:42.087]  That's right, who's the real fool out there?
[00:24:42.087 --> 00:24:49.413]  They tell you it's wise to follow the mainstream corporate media that absolutely has bad will towards you.
[00:24:51.218 --> 00:24:51.718]  You know that.
[00:24:51.718 --> 00:24:53.220]  You don't need Alex Jones to tell you that.
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:54.861]  I don't have all the answers.
[00:24:54.861 --> 00:24:55.942]  I'm trying to figure it all out.
[00:24:55.942 --> 00:25:02.387]  I just know these people are a pack of crooks and a pack of liars and fellow travelers with corruption.
[00:25:02.387 --> 00:25:04.349]  And I am not part of them.
[00:25:04.349 --> 00:25:06.330]  And I'm saying clearly, I'm not with you.
[00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:07.831]  I don't want to be with you.
[00:25:07.831 --> 00:25:09.052]  I want away from you.
[00:25:09.052 --> 00:25:11.795]  And I want you out of my life.
[00:25:12.856 --> 00:25:14.276]  I want free association.
[00:25:14.276 --> 00:25:15.617]  I want to keep my money.
[00:25:15.617 --> 00:25:22.379]  I want to keep the fruit of my own labor so I can work with people I want to work with and build a civilization.
[00:25:22.379 --> 00:25:27.581]  You control freaks telling us how all day how we didn't build this or we didn't do that.
[00:25:27.581 --> 00:25:32.982]  And lecturing us that parents aren't really parents of their kids and the state is.
[00:25:32.982 --> 00:25:35.083]  Listen you freaks!
[00:25:35.083 --> 00:25:37.083]  Keep drinking your own Kool-Aid.
[00:25:37.083 --> 00:25:39.724]  Keep smoking your own dope.
[00:25:39.724 --> 00:25:41.785]  Because the only people buying your bull
[00:25:43.550 --> 00:25:47.933]  Are you and your minions?
[00:25:47.933 --> 00:25:57.080]  Tyrants always fall, ladies and gentlemen, but it's a tectonic battle that goes on and on, on and on and on.
[00:25:57.080 --> 00:26:01.943]  It isn't a zero-sum game where either one side totally wins, the other side totally loses.
[00:26:01.943 --> 00:26:06.046]  You only totally lose if you give in to pure evil.
[00:26:06.046 --> 00:26:07.927]  And I don't want to get into the philosophic anymore.
[00:26:07.927 --> 00:26:08.448]  The point is,
[00:26:11.064 --> 00:26:12.785]  Is that there is a war going on.
[00:26:12.785 --> 00:26:15.286]  There's always a war going on.
[00:26:15.286 --> 00:26:17.426]  Between freedom and tyranny.
[00:26:17.426 --> 00:26:19.027]  Now you better decide what side you're on.
[00:26:19.027 --> 00:26:21.728]  It's very simple.
[00:26:21.728 --> 00:26:22.948]  Let's go to these headlines here.
[00:26:22.948 --> 00:26:24.869]  We'll come back with your calls in the next segment at 800-259-9231.
[00:26:28.168 --> 00:26:29.429]  Document Cam, please.
[00:26:29.429 --> 00:26:29.890]  Look at this.
[00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:37.757]  White House says it had no idea the DOJ seized the AP's phone records.
[00:26:37.757 --> 00:26:49.689]  Oh, I'm sure, and they didn't know about Benghazi, and they didn't know about the IRS, and Eric Holder, he didn't know about Fast and Furious either, and they didn't know anything about anything.
[00:26:51.149 --> 00:26:59.975]  Other than press reports, we had no knowledge of any attempt by the Justice Department to seek phone records from the AP to try to go after leakers.
[00:26:59.975 --> 00:27:02.516]  Leakers exposing their criminal activities.
[00:27:02.516 --> 00:27:10.321]  And by the way, ladies and gentlemen, they have the FBI Deputy Head of Counterterrorism on CNN a week and a half ago.
[00:27:10.321 --> 00:27:11.662]  We played the clip several times.
[00:27:11.662 --> 00:27:15.525]  It was in the New York Times, you name it.
[00:27:15.525 --> 00:27:17.066]  And the media's like, well, that's reasonable.
[00:27:17.066 --> 00:27:18.226]  They're trying to keep us safe.
[00:27:18.226 --> 00:27:20.188]  Oh, every phone call, every email's recorded?
[00:27:21.147 --> 00:27:27.649]  And so once you're a person of interest, oh, that doesn't violate the Fourth Amendment, then they go back to the recording.
[00:27:27.649 --> 00:27:45.174]  It'd be like your neighbor saying, I'm going to plant a camera in your bedroom to watch you and your wife have sex, just in case down the road, if you ever do something bad to her, let's just say you kill her, because you're guilty until proven innocent, then I can go back and see, you know, the video feed we're going to be capturing live.
[00:27:45.174 --> 00:27:48.835]  That's the equivalent of the absurdist nature of this.
[00:27:50.911 --> 00:27:59.354]  And so, in the news, the New York Times going, oh, and by the way, Obama wants to fix the wiretapping system.
[00:27:59.354 --> 00:28:01.935]  He wants to just be able to do it without warrants.
[00:28:01.935 --> 00:28:05.656]  And, you know, just go ahead and have everything wired through the NSA.
[00:28:05.656 --> 00:28:06.897]  It's already been done.
[00:28:06.897 --> 00:28:12.319]  And that's what the FBI deputy director said on CNN.
[00:28:12.319 --> 00:28:17.701]  He said, well, we can't really use this in a trial, but everything's been recorded.
[00:28:17.701 --> 00:28:18.881]  Everything's been saved.
[00:28:19.926 --> 00:28:25.050]  Well we already know that from the Telecommunications Act they put in place back in 96.
[00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:43.463]  It paid the nine billion dollars and by law the telecommunications companies by October 1st 2001, they had five years to do it, they had to have it in place to where they could go back and find the recordings of everything.
[00:28:44.656 --> 00:28:46.917]  And it's all there in the law.
[00:28:46.917 --> 00:28:49.118]  Doesn't mean it's constitutional.
[00:28:49.118 --> 00:28:51.239]  It's a law on infrastructure.
[00:28:51.239 --> 00:28:57.003]  Just like cyber security just basically legalizes the warrantless wiretapping.
[00:28:57.003 --> 00:28:59.604]  But you can't legalize something that's unconstitutional.
[00:29:02.375 --> 00:29:03.556]  So, this is what's going on.
[00:29:03.556 --> 00:29:08.479]  The White House says it had no idea the DOJ seized the AP's phone records.
[00:29:08.479 --> 00:29:09.700]  I know nothing.
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:11.241]  Remember Hogan's Heroes?
[00:29:11.241 --> 00:29:12.262]  Sergeant Schultz?
[00:29:12.262 --> 00:29:15.544]  I know nothing.
[00:29:15.544 --> 00:29:16.224]  Nothing.
[00:29:16.224 --> 00:29:19.626]  Is that a pretty good Sergeant Schultz?
[00:29:19.626 --> 00:29:20.947]  Dammit, Bobby.
[00:29:20.947 --> 00:29:29.293]  A continuing government probe obtains wide swath of AP phone records.
[00:29:29.293 --> 00:29:30.874]  Butane is a bastard gas.
[00:29:31.972 --> 00:29:35.793]  I better stop the Hank Hill imitations.
[00:29:35.793 --> 00:29:39.774]  Government probe obtains wide swath of AP phone records.
[00:29:39.774 --> 00:29:44.435]  Under sweeping subpoenas, Justice Department obtained AP phone records in leak investigation.
[00:29:44.435 --> 00:29:46.335]  And look, they were already spying.
[00:29:46.335 --> 00:29:49.776]  They went to get the subpoena to make legal what they already had.
[00:29:49.776 --> 00:29:51.156]  We're on the march.
[00:29:51.156 --> 00:29:53.676]  The Empire's on the run.
[00:29:53.676 --> 00:29:56.357]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.973 --> 00:30:04.375]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[00:30:04.375 --> 00:30:10.439]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[00:30:10.439 --> 00:30:14.321]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?

[00:31:01.394 --> 00:31:07.518]  For nearly 20 years, Alex has been the voice of warning on threatening issues that the big media won't dare talk about.
[00:31:07.518 --> 00:31:09.640]  Threats that trample the American dream.
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:11.561]  You know what we all face.
[00:31:11.561 --> 00:31:15.463]  A crashing economy that's forcing millions out of work and from their homes.
[00:31:15.463 --> 00:31:18.565]  Half of Americans need help just to feed themselves.
[00:31:18.565 --> 00:31:22.328]  Legalized pollution of our food is sickening us with cancer and disease.
[00:31:22.328 --> 00:31:26.631]  The food you can trust in facing any of these threats comes from eFoods Direct.

[00:31:31.374 --> 00:31:31.754]  I think so.

[00:33:10.894 --> 00:33:20.417]  I have sworn upon the altar of God eternal hostility against every form of tyranny over the mind of man.
[00:33:20.417 --> 00:33:26.378]  Thomas Jefferson.
[00:33:26.378 --> 00:33:31.980]  Okay, so let's run through the headlines and then to your phone calls here today.
[00:33:33.982 --> 00:33:35.982]  Yes, this is Watergate.
[00:33:35.982 --> 00:33:37.583]  This is much bigger than Watergate.
[00:33:37.583 --> 00:33:43.644]  Benghazi is much more hardcore and serious in a loss of life than Watergate.
[00:33:43.644 --> 00:33:45.704]  I'm not saying Richard Nixon was a good guy.
[00:33:45.704 --> 00:33:50.645]  I certainly would have supported his impeachment and stepping down.
[00:33:50.645 --> 00:34:01.247]  But Benghazi standing down while people got killed, being caught lying about it, ordering the stand downs, using Al-Qaeda security forces they'd hired to run Benghazi to do it.
[00:34:03.277 --> 00:34:10.682]  It's just their policies are so Machiavelli, so evil, and they're in plain view.
[00:34:10.682 --> 00:34:12.464]  So you've got that going on.
[00:34:12.464 --> 00:34:23.812]  And I think the power structure, I think, I don't think, I know, they're scared that the public has finally understood that the global crime syndicate runs Al Qaeda, and so the rats are now leaving the sinking ship.
[00:34:24.608 --> 00:34:31.457]  Because they're afraid the sinking ship may blow up, and they don't want to be taken down with it.
[00:34:31.457 --> 00:34:32.939]  It's really that simple.
[00:34:32.939 --> 00:34:39.306]  You're seeing a stampede of fear away from Obama, but more than that, his own minions don't like him.
[00:34:39.306 --> 00:34:42.731]  His own minions don't like the dishonourableness of it.
[00:34:42.731 --> 00:34:43.291]  It's creepy.
[00:34:44.372 --> 00:34:53.737]  And so the completely amoral behavior of Obama and his controllers is really setting him up for a giant fall.
[00:34:53.737 --> 00:34:55.558]  Now, I'll say this again.
[00:34:55.558 --> 00:34:59.200]  You've got the IRS scandal going after groups.
[00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:13.268]  I was reading the quotes yesterday where the inspector general was breaking down the directives and it said people that promote the Constitution, that's a quote, people that
[00:35:15.509 --> 00:35:17.230]  People are fearful of big government.
[00:35:17.230 --> 00:35:19.912]  People that don't trust the government.
[00:35:19.912 --> 00:35:23.174]  I mean, America is founded on don't trust the government.
[00:35:23.174 --> 00:35:26.176]  If you don't like that, get out of America.
[00:35:26.176 --> 00:35:29.879]  Because everywhere else, governments are like North Korea in history.
[00:35:29.879 --> 00:35:34.542]  Thank God our forebears tried to tie down government.
[00:35:34.542 --> 00:35:40.566]  It's certainly been corrupt and out of control, but nothing compared to other countries, because we had some basic checks and balances.
[00:35:40.566 --> 00:35:41.387]  And I know I'm preaching.
[00:35:42.885 --> 00:35:44.586]  But they ordered the spying.
[00:35:44.586 --> 00:35:47.987]  They've been spying on whistleblowers and persecuting them.
[00:35:47.987 --> 00:35:52.748]  Folks, I've had so many sources in the last 18 years.
[00:35:52.748 --> 00:35:55.709]  And I've developed some really good ones the last 10 or so.
[00:35:55.709 --> 00:35:59.850]  Because people have learned that I won't ever give up sources.
[00:35:59.850 --> 00:36:05.192]  In the last 4 or 5 years, I mean, my sources have dried up to almost nothing because they're all scared.
[00:36:05.192 --> 00:36:09.473]  I mean, I don't want to do the globalist job for them and scare people from whistleblowing.
[00:36:09.473 --> 00:36:11.434]  But whistleblowers already know this and they've been told.
[00:36:12.432 --> 00:36:15.634]  You know, the memos have come out where they threaten people in the federal government.
[00:36:15.634 --> 00:36:21.877]  Even if they know crimes are being committed, they're not to report it to even another agency, or they can be prosecuted.
[00:36:21.877 --> 00:36:24.418]  Prosecuted by kangaroo courts?
[00:36:24.418 --> 00:36:36.204]  I mean, reporting on crime outside of your agency is totally protected under common law, Bill of Rights, Constitution, jurisprudence, precedence, and it's being overthrown.
[00:36:36.204 --> 00:36:38.865]  That's how you know these are really bad people.
[00:36:38.865 --> 00:36:40.906]  And, I mean, I'll have a FEMA person on.
[00:36:42.871 --> 00:36:46.213]  They will mail me info.
[00:36:46.213 --> 00:36:53.058]  They will say, please call me at this number from another line, you know, not part of your phone system.
[00:36:53.058 --> 00:36:55.760]  I'll call them.
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:36:58.982]  And this happened a few years ago.
[00:36:58.982 --> 00:37:02.384]  And then they, you know, give me more info.
[00:37:02.384 --> 00:37:02.945]  I call.
[00:37:02.945 --> 00:37:04.085]  I check the information.
[00:37:04.085 --> 00:37:04.586]  It breaks.
[00:37:05.848 --> 00:37:12.534]  And then they call them a week later and say, oh my god, they called me in, they know it's me, and they've been listening to my phone.
[00:37:12.534 --> 00:37:16.297]  They're listening to everybody, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:37:16.297 --> 00:37:18.098]  But something's happening.
[00:37:18.098 --> 00:37:20.701]  People in government are getting to the point of going, you know what, I don't care.
[00:37:21.857 --> 00:37:25.539]  And I think if you're going to go public, do it like Seibel Edmonds.
[00:37:25.539 --> 00:37:27.441]  Go have a press conference.
[00:37:27.441 --> 00:37:30.102]  Ahmad Salam was given the bomb.
[00:37:30.102 --> 00:37:31.023]  Real detonators.
[00:37:31.023 --> 00:37:34.185]  He said, are you going to blow up the World Trade Center for real in 1993?
[00:37:34.185 --> 00:37:35.265]  I didn't sign on for this.
[00:37:35.265 --> 00:37:36.726]  And he knew they were setting him up.
[00:37:36.726 --> 00:37:38.828]  So he recorded them.
[00:37:38.828 --> 00:37:44.171]  And then he went and gave a press conference with his lawyer with the recordings and the transcripts for the media.
[00:37:44.171 --> 00:37:47.193]  And so they paid him off 1.4 mil.
[00:37:47.193 --> 00:37:50.175]  And instead of going to prison, he got paid and got to leave the country.
[00:37:51.564 --> 00:37:53.545]  Now, what's the moral of that story?
[00:37:53.545 --> 00:38:06.573]  If you're gonna whistleblow, go put it on YouTube, shoot your own video, hold up your documents, say what you're doing, send it out to a hundred media outlets, and some of them will have the courage.
[00:38:06.573 --> 00:38:12.177]  You know, you saw the FBI in the Boston bombing going, don't look at drills, and don't look at any photos this guy's got.
[00:38:12.177 --> 00:38:15.199]  Only look at what we give you.
[00:38:15.199 --> 00:38:18.681]  And Badandi said there were several hundred press in that huge briefing room.
[00:38:18.681 --> 00:38:20.342]  Boston bombing, worldwide press conference.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.302]  We have the videos, hundreds.
[00:38:24.302 --> 00:38:26.384]  Over 200, estimating.
[00:38:26.384 --> 00:38:30.067]  And none of them would dare go look at his info or ask questions.
[00:38:30.067 --> 00:38:41.817]  They nodded their heads, and a few of them, including some mainstream media people that are very well-recognized, they wanted to be off-record, they came over to Dan and the other guys, our camera guys, after and said, we want to say you've got incredible courage.
[00:38:41.817 --> 00:38:42.577]  They said something else.
[00:38:42.577 --> 00:38:44.459]  They said, you've got giant you-know-whats.
[00:38:44.459 --> 00:38:45.399]  We admire you.
[00:38:45.399 --> 00:38:47.061]  We admire what InfoWars is doing.
[00:38:47.061 --> 00:38:48.342]  We're scared.
[00:38:48.342 --> 00:38:49.323]  And we know this is a
[00:38:50.583 --> 00:38:52.964]  Stage deal.
[00:38:52.964 --> 00:38:54.965]  Or, we know something's fishy, was the quote.
[00:38:54.965 --> 00:38:59.626]  And then I talked to another big national reporter, and he's like, oh, I think something's fishy.
[00:38:59.626 --> 00:39:00.367]  No, I agree with you.
[00:39:00.367 --> 00:39:01.767]  They're covering up.
[00:39:01.767 --> 00:39:03.128]  Well, come on!
[00:39:03.128 --> 00:39:03.748]  Come on!
[00:39:03.748 --> 00:39:07.869]  I mean, we can't just sit here forever and just put up with anything.
[00:39:07.869 --> 00:39:09.890]  That doesn't protect society.
[00:39:09.890 --> 00:39:10.990]  It destroys society.
[00:39:10.990 --> 00:39:13.971]  Are we mice or men?
[00:39:13.971 --> 00:39:15.012]  I mean, who are we?
[00:39:15.012 --> 00:39:17.273]  I mean, are we going to put up with anything out of these people?
[00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:24.331]  You know, I had a state police officer.
[00:39:24.331 --> 00:39:25.752]  He wasn't out of Kansas.
[00:39:25.752 --> 00:39:29.893]  I mean, out of Missouri.
[00:39:29.893 --> 00:39:37.035]  It was... See, I don't lie on air.
[00:39:37.035 --> 00:39:42.937]  Except I will involuntarily, to cover for sources, I will scramble where the stuff came from sometimes.
[00:39:42.937 --> 00:39:46.258]  It was state police.
[00:39:46.258 --> 00:39:48.099]  But it was not state police in Kansas City.
[00:39:50.605 --> 00:39:54.286]  In Missouri that gave us the info.
[00:39:54.286 --> 00:40:02.368]  It was a California senior member of the state police who was at a federal meeting in Missouri.
[00:40:02.368 --> 00:40:17.492]  So technically, technically it was Missouri, but they still found out who he was and went after him and demoted him.
[00:40:17.492 --> 00:40:19.533]  I was given information by a federal marshal.
[00:40:23.732 --> 00:40:24.752]  They found out about that.
[00:40:24.752 --> 00:40:26.613]  I mean, they're listening to the phones.
[00:40:26.613 --> 00:40:28.754]  You know, I sit there with members of the press.
[00:40:28.754 --> 00:40:32.235]  I was sitting there with Esquire.
[00:40:32.235 --> 00:40:36.777]  And I'm going, listen, they've called up my wife and said what she was just talking about.
[00:40:36.777 --> 00:40:40.798]  And they've done it to me before to let you know they're tapping your phones.
[00:40:40.798 --> 00:40:43.019]  Believe me, we're not in Kansas anymore.
[00:40:43.019 --> 00:40:47.161]  And the guy looked at me and did not believe me.
[00:40:47.161 --> 00:40:50.422]  Because these people are naive, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:40:52.113 --> 00:40:57.057]  And what's happening is America is losing its naivete.
[00:40:57.057 --> 00:40:58.238]  I'll go to calls, as I promised.
[00:40:58.238 --> 00:40:59.939]  I'm gonna go to your calls right now or I never will.
[00:40:59.939 --> 00:41:09.507]  Then I'll get into all the details of the IRS, the Benghazi gate, the spying on the AP.
[00:41:09.507 --> 00:41:15.912]  And again, it's just like the Deputy Director of Counterterrorism said on CNN.
[00:41:17.236 --> 00:41:19.038]  You guys pull that article up, I forget his name.
[00:41:19.038 --> 00:41:20.198]  We played it twice last week.
[00:41:20.198 --> 00:41:21.880]  It was all over the news, you saw it.
[00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:30.947]  He said, well, we can't really use this in court, but then once something happens, we can go back, we have it recorded, and then we can get a subpoena and stuff and use it in court.
[00:41:30.947 --> 00:41:31.868]  See, that's what they're doing.
[00:41:31.868 --> 00:41:39.094]  They're illegally spying on everything, and then when they want to use it in court, they go get a subpoena.
[00:41:39.094 --> 00:41:40.515]  And it's kind of like shopping.
[00:41:40.515 --> 00:41:43.337]  It's kind of like they go and dig through your drawers,
[00:41:44.443 --> 00:41:45.523]  Without a warrant.
[00:41:45.523 --> 00:41:47.124]  It's not kind of like that's exactly what they do.
[00:41:47.124 --> 00:41:50.924]  They kind of go and dig through all your dresser drawers, dig through all your stuff, your bank accounts.
[00:41:50.924 --> 00:41:54.585]  And then if they find something or plant something, that's the bigger issue.
[00:41:54.585 --> 00:41:57.626]  Then they go and get the warrant to make it all on the up and up.
[00:41:57.626 --> 00:41:59.326]  And now they're too lazy to do that.
[00:41:59.326 --> 00:42:00.827]  We don't even want to do that!
[00:42:00.827 --> 00:42:06.568]  I was talking to some Texas Rangers.
[00:42:07.776 --> 00:42:15.518]  Who came in here threatening a subpoena if I didn't give them a source on some Marines that were in the same unit.
[00:42:15.518 --> 00:42:21.500]  Gave us photos of the supposed shooter of Chris Kyle, the Most Deadly Sniper author.
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:27.081]  And they came over here and they said, well, we'll come back with a subpoena.
[00:42:27.081 --> 00:42:29.262]  Then I called them back later and I made some other phone calls.
[00:42:29.262 --> 00:42:30.262]  I got the guy's card in there.
[00:42:30.262 --> 00:42:31.542]  Hey, will you bring me that card in there?
[00:42:31.542 --> 00:42:32.903]  It's hanging on Chris's computer.
[00:42:32.903 --> 00:42:33.843]  At least it was last week.
[00:42:34.758 --> 00:42:37.599]  And I call them up, and they're like, oh, Alex, don't worry about it.
[00:42:37.599 --> 00:42:39.619]  We got it another way.
[00:42:39.619 --> 00:42:42.039]  And then I ran into one of these Texas Rangers later.
[00:42:42.039 --> 00:42:44.280]  They're like, oh, you know, we got ways of getting stuff.
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:45.420]  And I went, what?
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:47.620]  Data mining snooping from third-party companies?
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:49.401]  He goes, you said it, not me.
[00:42:49.401 --> 00:42:51.581]  I mean, here it is.
[00:42:51.581 --> 00:42:53.782]  Gary Phillips, Texas Ranger.
[00:42:53.782 --> 00:42:59.162]  You know, I talk about stuff like this, and the trolls go, there's no Texas Rangers at your office.
[00:42:59.162 --> 00:43:01.243]  There's no Secret Service at your office.
[00:43:02.042 --> 00:43:18.787]  When they come up here with subpoenas and gag orders and stuff, and later it's, you know, in the Associated Press, a year later, when some idiot listener puts threats on Infowars.com, it's just, this is the real world, is what I'm telling you.
[00:43:18.787 --> 00:43:20.228]  This is the real world.
[00:43:20.228 --> 00:43:24.389]  And instead of it intimidating us, we need to be like the state police in Colorado,
[00:43:25.256 --> 00:43:30.857]  When they go to these meetings and the FEMA tells them, this is restricted, not classified, but restricted.
[00:43:30.857 --> 00:43:34.538]  What are state police doing in meetings where it's quasi-classified?
[00:43:34.538 --> 00:43:37.298]  That just means they don't want this info out to the public.
[00:43:37.298 --> 00:43:39.539]  They use that to protect the criminality.
[00:43:39.539 --> 00:43:43.259]  We want to know if you're ready to confiscate guns from Christians.
[00:43:43.259 --> 00:43:51.481]  And then they're sitting there with three FEMA guys in the room, monitoring the room full of a hundred state police senior officers to see
[00:43:52.978 --> 00:43:56.000]  Senior troopers to see who is a patriot and who isn't.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:58.242]  They're running PSYOPs.
[00:43:58.242 --> 00:44:02.945]  They're running clandestine operations against America.
[00:44:02.945 --> 00:44:05.107]  They're there finding out who's a criminal.
[00:44:05.107 --> 00:44:10.170]  I mean, they're getting on MSNBC and saying your kids don't belong to you in ads.
[00:44:10.170 --> 00:44:14.273]  They're just trying to normalize all this.
[00:44:14.273 --> 00:44:16.435]  And we don't need it to be normalized.
[00:44:16.435 --> 00:44:18.516]  We need to throw this up.
[00:44:18.516 --> 00:44:19.157]  This is poison.
[00:44:20.984 --> 00:44:28.430]  I hate to use the analogy, but have you ever had bad food and it's not sitting right?
[00:44:28.430 --> 00:44:34.315]  And one time I'm college went to a restaurant and all you could eat.
[00:44:34.315 --> 00:44:39.059]  And my two buddies got real sick the next day with that night with food poisoning.
[00:44:39.059 --> 00:44:43.523]  And I, I'm not somebody that gets nauseous very often, but it didn't sit right.
[00:44:43.523 --> 00:44:44.204]  It tasted weird.
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:48.961]  And I just had a gut feeling and went in the bathroom and threw up.
[00:44:48.961 --> 00:44:50.382]  And got it out.
[00:44:50.382 --> 00:44:53.063]  And I didn't get very sick.
[00:44:53.063 --> 00:44:54.883]  They did.
[00:44:54.883 --> 00:44:57.924]  The point is, is that you've got to recognize poison.
[00:44:57.924 --> 00:44:59.245]  And I know I'm preaching.
[00:44:59.245 --> 00:45:00.865]  It's just these people are poison.
[00:45:00.865 --> 00:45:04.427]  And the answer is do not be afraid of all the fact that they're spying on us.
[00:45:04.427 --> 00:45:05.087]  Good.
[00:45:05.087 --> 00:45:07.168]  I hope you're listening criminals.
[00:45:07.168 --> 00:45:09.388]  Because you're the people that have something to hide.
[00:45:09.388 --> 00:45:10.689]  And we're going to expose you.
[00:45:12.008 --> 00:45:13.489]  And we're going to route you out.
[00:45:13.489 --> 00:45:15.309]  And we're not intimidated.
[00:45:15.309 --> 00:45:17.610]  We're not intimidated that you're listening to us crooks.
[00:45:17.610 --> 00:45:20.871]  That indicts you.
[00:45:20.871 --> 00:45:23.052]  The answer is all of us getting active.
[00:45:23.052 --> 00:45:23.773]  Good!
[00:45:23.773 --> 00:45:25.353]  You know what they'll see on their radar screen?
[00:45:25.353 --> 00:45:27.514]  A million blips coming at them.
[00:45:27.514 --> 00:45:28.514]  You're not going to knock that down.
[00:45:28.514 --> 00:45:30.715]  You're not going to stop that.
[00:45:30.715 --> 00:45:32.436]  It's the mass effect.
[00:45:32.436 --> 00:45:34.677]  They cannot stop a mass awakening effect.
[00:45:34.677 --> 00:45:36.077]  And that's what's happening right now.
[00:45:36.077 --> 00:45:39.739]  So they're desperately trying to normalize it with a normalcy bias.
[00:45:41.004 --> 00:45:47.047]  Well, honestly, Alex, I've really just got to admit with everything you're saying, I try to find fault with what you're saying, I really do.
[00:45:47.047 --> 00:45:48.668]  But I've got to admit, I mean, these
[00:46:10.956 --> 00:46:14.718]  This type of stuff goes all the way back to J. Edgar Hoover.
[00:46:14.718 --> 00:46:17.940]  They collect information, get the subpoenas later.
[00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:20.921]  I mean, we've got to seize on what we've got now.
[00:46:20.921 --> 00:46:22.622]  We've got the AP scandal.
[00:46:22.622 --> 00:46:25.524]  We've got the IRS Tea Party, the Benghazi.
[00:46:25.524 --> 00:46:27.585]  People forgotten about that.
[00:46:27.585 --> 00:46:29.205]  We've got to remind them.
[00:46:29.205 --> 00:46:30.766]  We've got to call our senators.
[00:46:30.766 --> 00:46:32.027]  We've got to contact them.
[00:46:32.027 --> 00:46:34.528]  We've got to demand that they investigate this.
[00:46:34.528 --> 00:46:37.710]  We've got to seize on what we have now.
[00:46:37.710 --> 00:46:39.251]  And we've got to move forward with that.
[00:46:39.251 --> 00:46:39.871]  We can't just
[00:46:40.419 --> 00:46:46.505]  Allow this to be, you know, another business as usual type of situation.
[00:46:46.505 --> 00:46:47.506]  I agree with you.
[00:46:47.506 --> 00:46:58.396]  And if we ask the question, will Obama politically with his gang of miscreants, gang of arrogant, arrogant
[00:47:00.339 --> 00:47:01.639]  Twits.
[00:47:01.639 --> 00:47:03.120]  Will they succeed?
[00:47:03.120 --> 00:47:04.560]  That's up to us.
[00:47:04.560 --> 00:47:08.302]  I don't think they're going to get away with this if we use this against them.
[00:47:08.302 --> 00:47:10.422]  And now is the time to hammer down.
[00:47:10.422 --> 00:47:11.903]  And this is going to get everybody else covered.
[00:47:11.903 --> 00:47:14.964]  That's why Mitch McConnell and others are saying a lot more is coming.
[00:47:14.964 --> 00:47:16.164]  They've known all this stuff.
[00:47:16.164 --> 00:47:17.525]  They've been scared to use it.
[00:47:17.525 --> 00:47:20.886]  It's all going to start coming out and it's going to get very, very nasty.
[00:47:22.609 --> 00:47:25.652]  Since 2010, 2011, we know who the criminals are.
[00:47:25.652 --> 00:47:27.033]  They're Eric Holder.
[00:47:27.033 --> 00:47:28.495]  They're Hillary Clinton.
[00:47:28.495 --> 00:47:29.696]  They're Barack Obama.
[00:47:29.696 --> 00:47:31.498]  We've got to seize now.
[00:47:31.498 --> 00:47:38.145]  We've got to just make sure that our Congressmen and our Senate, you know, go after this aggressively.
[00:47:38.145 --> 00:47:39.987]  I mean, it's just now or never.
[00:47:41.610 --> 00:47:42.750]  Absolutely.
[00:47:42.750 --> 00:47:45.671]  And again, not let all their creepy police state stuff scare us.
[00:47:45.671 --> 00:47:47.892]  So when I say police state, I don't mean the average cop.
[00:47:47.892 --> 00:47:49.972]  I mean police state North Korea.
[00:47:49.972 --> 00:47:54.153]  I mean the political control of the police is going into a very dangerous area.
[00:47:54.153 --> 00:47:55.634]  It needs to be reversed.
[00:47:55.634 --> 00:47:56.594]  I appreciate your call.
[00:47:56.594 --> 00:47:57.894]  Great points, Jason.
[00:47:57.894 --> 00:48:01.755]  Let's talk to another Jason in Alabama.
[00:48:01.755 --> 00:48:04.176]  You're on the air, Jason.
[00:48:04.176 --> 00:48:04.756]  Hi, Alex.
[00:48:04.756 --> 00:48:06.537]  Long-time listener.
[00:48:06.537 --> 00:48:07.257]  First-time caller.
[00:48:08.706 --> 00:48:11.548]  I want to agree that I don't think Hillary can get out of this.
[00:48:11.548 --> 00:48:13.869]  You know, all of this happened on her watch.
[00:48:13.869 --> 00:48:14.649]  It's not enough, though.
[00:48:14.649 --> 00:48:15.850]  Hillary, Hillary's not enough.
[00:48:15.850 --> 00:48:18.071]  They all need to go to jail.
[00:48:18.071 --> 00:48:19.892]  But I definitely agree with you on that one.
[00:48:19.892 --> 00:48:28.597]  Honestly, I don't see how Obama can get out of this, considering, you know, he came out, I think it was two weeks after after the attack happened in front of the U.N.
[00:48:28.597 --> 00:48:31.239]  and three separate times he blamed the YouTube video.
[00:48:31.806 --> 00:48:38.711]  And then he came out just a couple days ago and said that two days after the attack happened, they knew it was terrorist, they knew everything about it.
[00:48:38.711 --> 00:48:42.514]  I mean, he's been caught in a major lie in just the past few days.
[00:48:44.983 --> 00:48:54.847]  Yes, and now he's saying, I know nothing about Benghazi, I know neither does Hillary, I know nothing about IRS-Gate, and it's intimidation, it's spying, it's harassment.
[00:48:54.847 --> 00:48:57.028]  I know nothing about spying on the media.
[00:48:57.028 --> 00:48:58.249]  Eric Holder did it.
[00:48:58.249 --> 00:49:04.752]  Okay, well Eric Holder then, there needs to be hearings, he needs to be indicted, but he's the Justice Department.
[00:49:04.752 --> 00:49:07.493]  How do you indict the guy that's over that?
[00:49:07.493 --> 00:49:09.674]  You can't have Hitler over the Nuremberg trials.
[00:49:13.172 --> 00:49:15.292]  I'm not sure exactly how we get Obama.
[00:49:15.292 --> 00:49:16.593]  Special prosecutor.
[00:49:16.593 --> 00:49:17.933]  You have a special prosecutor.
[00:49:17.933 --> 00:49:21.033]  But then they'll be political and drag it out over several years.
[00:49:21.033 --> 00:49:22.534]  We don't need that.
[00:49:22.534 --> 00:49:23.674]  We need grand juries.
[00:49:23.674 --> 00:49:24.954]  We need state movements.
[00:49:24.954 --> 00:49:31.135]  We need the media to call for Obama to resign now, along with Biden.
[00:49:31.135 --> 00:49:32.876]  I mean, we need to get rid of these criminals.
[00:49:32.876 --> 00:49:33.896]  They're dangerous.
[00:49:33.896 --> 00:49:35.096]  And here's the other question.
[00:49:35.096 --> 00:49:37.616]  You think they might stage something to try to get out of this?
[00:49:37.616 --> 00:49:40.837]  Could staging something get them out of this?
[00:49:42.591 --> 00:49:52.620]  Well, I think a couple of these different things that have shown up in the news the last couple of days have been, might have been, been trying to release new information to get our attention off of things.
[00:49:53.612 --> 00:49:54.252]  Well, I agree.
[00:49:54.252 --> 00:50:09.441]  Benghazi is the ordered stand-down and it's murder and they've been caught red-handed and the whole military knows it because there were so many witnesses in those situation rooms of NATO, the Army, the Navy, the Marines, CENTCOM, all of it.
[00:50:09.441 --> 00:50:18.846]  There were probably, let's be conservative, a thousand people or more, they estimate, I've seen different estimates, that were watching different live feeds of that going on and know it was a stand-down.
[00:50:18.846 --> 00:50:22.628]  And so as bad as IRS gate and phone hacking gate
[00:50:23.308 --> 00:50:26.811]  All this is, it is nothing compared to that.
[00:50:26.811 --> 00:50:30.434]  But they know the media wants to go with all these stories.
[00:50:30.434 --> 00:50:37.219]  And so now allowing some of that... See, the average media is kept on a very short leash.
[00:50:37.219 --> 00:50:42.623]  And I think it's more than them distracting, but I think that's kind of the hope.
[00:50:42.623 --> 00:50:43.724]  But I don't think that's going to work.
[00:50:43.724 --> 00:50:45.545]  I think it just piles on to Benghazi.
[00:50:48.407 --> 00:50:50.009]  Wow, that is Machiavellian.
[00:50:50.009 --> 00:50:52.891]  Burning themself is a distraction from the big one.
[00:50:52.891 --> 00:50:56.375]  Because, yeah, you're talking treason stuff with Benghazi.
[00:50:56.375 --> 00:50:58.056]  Not just your run-of-the-mill corruption.
[00:50:58.056 --> 00:50:58.777]  We'll be right back.
[00:50:58.777 --> 00:50:59.137]  Stay with us.
[00:50:59.137 --> 00:50:59.498]  More calls.
[00:51:01.121 --> 00:51:02.682]  Don't throw away leftovers.
[00:51:02.682 --> 00:51:08.764]  Instead, throw all your leftovers, vegetable peels, eggshells, coffee grounds, pizza crusts, and more into the Bokashi!
[00:51:08.764 --> 00:51:16.968]  If you love to garden and compost but don't like the hassle of turning a compost bin or the smell, then check out the E-M Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System from Terragonics.
[00:51:16.968 --> 00:51:22.610]  Finally, a way to recycle all your food and plant waste safely and effectively and stop using fertilizers.
[00:51:22.610 --> 00:51:24.831]  The E-M Bokashi Food Waste Recycling System.

[00:52:41.207 --> 00:52:41.587]  I think so.
[00:53:00.578 --> 00:53:12.203]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile Virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support your immune system.
[00:53:12.203 --> 00:53:25.429]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary new silver solution that is clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver, and is powerful enough to help protect you and your family.

[00:53:29.591 --> 00:53:30.292]  We're good to go.
[00:54:09.855 --> 00:54:20.444]  Alright, we'll continue with calls into the next hour, and we're going to get an update on all the different activities of Monsanto and their bio-warfare system.
[00:54:20.444 --> 00:54:22.445]  I'll also get into Russia to expel a U.S.
[00:54:22.445 --> 00:54:26.569]  diplomat who they caught with wigs and all these fake glasses and stuff.
[00:54:26.569 --> 00:54:34.795]  Our media's like, he's not CIA, and of course it's some yuppie surfer dude, you know, one of the
[00:54:35.956 --> 00:54:49.042]  Underling diplomats there running around with, you know, wigs and glasses, probably had fake noses, playing the part of a spy with a bag of money and instructions for the Russian.
[00:54:49.042 --> 00:54:51.543]  Oh yeah, I mean, let's run around with written instructions.
[00:54:51.543 --> 00:55:02.108]  It's just these people are... See, the average yuppie thinks if they join the CIA, it like, suddenly they get like wings like Icarus and they can fly around and they're all powerful and cool and...
[00:55:04.471 --> 00:55:14.158]  It's the new class system, where if you're in government and you talk into your earpiece and you, you know, you strut around and... I mean, I've been in D.C.
[00:55:14.158 --> 00:55:19.863]  and had Secret Service run over to me just anywhere in the city trying to videotape anything and go, I'm Secret Service!
[00:55:19.863 --> 00:55:22.205]  I'm... I'm... I'm Diplomatic Security!
[00:55:22.205 --> 00:55:23.686]  You little filth!
[00:55:23.686 --> 00:55:26.768]  They're all just puffed up and they've arrived!
[00:55:26.768 --> 00:55:28.529]  There's somebody!
[00:55:28.529 --> 00:55:30.071]  Why, they're with the government!
[00:55:30.071 --> 00:55:31.552]  I mean, move to North Korea!
[00:55:34.258 --> 00:55:47.568]  It's just a bunch of idiots running around acting tough, hiring Al-Qaeda to commit mass murder all over Syria, and they put out propaganda videos eating people's hearts, leaders of the
[00:55:48.976 --> 00:55:53.558]  Pre-Syria Army, the Al-Qaeda group, and now even mainstream news admits they're Al-Qaeda.
[00:55:53.558 --> 00:56:02.062]  And then they've got this guy with a guy's heart with all the aorta arteries hanging off the top of it, and he's chewing on it like a rat or something.
[00:56:02.062 --> 00:56:05.604]  Outrage at Syrian rebels shown eating soldiers' heart.
[00:56:05.604 --> 00:56:08.986]  And all that's going to do is make the Syrians fight harder.
[00:56:08.986 --> 00:56:13.448]  I mean, what, you think some punk chewing on somebody's heart's going to scare everyone?
[00:56:13.448 --> 00:56:16.189]  And, oh, you're chewing on someone's heart.
[00:56:16.189 --> 00:56:17.450]  We'll give in to you now.
[00:56:19.141 --> 00:56:20.802]  But that's what criminals always do.
[00:56:20.802 --> 00:56:27.245]  They dominate, they intimidate, and then they think, if I just intimidate more, it'll make everyone bow down to me.
[00:56:27.245 --> 00:56:28.666]  No, no, no, no, you don't get it.
[00:56:28.666 --> 00:56:32.228]  People were just trying to be nice and stay out of your way.
[00:56:32.228 --> 00:56:36.430]  Until you pushed it, and you pushed it, and you pushed it.
[00:56:36.430 --> 00:56:40.872]  We're gonna go to break here in a moment, come back with the next hour, and I promise, go right to your calls.
[00:56:40.872 --> 00:56:44.534]  I wanna hear what you think about Obamagate and where all this is going.
[00:56:44.534 --> 00:56:48.056]  Think about how they've denied their spying on us, and now it's all admitted.
[00:56:49.096 --> 00:56:57.860]  And then I've got articles here where the so-called left is defending Obama.
[00:56:57.860 --> 00:56:58.920]  And they're in the news.
[00:56:58.920 --> 00:57:00.821]  I've got the articles I'm going to cover in the next hour.
[00:57:00.821 --> 00:57:12.685]  Defending, spying on Tea Parties, and harassing Tea Parties, and using the IRS to demand records of who came to Tea Party meetings, like it's the Soviet Union.
[00:57:12.685 --> 00:57:16.707]  That's why they're going to use the IRS to get your medical records now.
[00:57:16.707 --> 00:57:18.628]  That's why they're going to use it to enforce everything.
[00:57:19.485 --> 00:57:25.859]  Because it's the unconstitutional criminal group that will do whatever they're told.
[00:57:25.859 --> 00:57:26.801]  It is outrageous.
[00:57:29.349 --> 00:57:36.111]  Now, before I go any further, just briefly at the end of this hour, there is a revolution happening of awakening against tyranny.
[00:57:36.111 --> 00:57:44.393]  And the biggest and best thing you can do is spread the word about this broadcast and InfoWars.com and the free iPhone app and the free audio and video streams.
[00:57:44.393 --> 00:57:51.254]  Everything that's at InfoWars.com forward slash show or InfoWars forward slash listen.
[00:57:51.254 --> 00:57:58.556]  It all takes you to the same place because that's what I'm after is waking America and the world up and having a future for my family.
[00:57:59.136 --> 00:58:07.759]  And I know that you want the same thing, so we are aligned when it comes to wanting a good, prosperous, justice-filled future.
[00:58:07.759 --> 00:58:09.460]  Also, support us financially.
[00:58:09.460 --> 00:58:24.226]  I have found the best videos, books, bumper stickers, t-shirts, water filters, non-GMO seeds, all of it at the huge online shopping center there at infowarestore.com.

[00:58:43.302 --> 00:58:47.266]  This is GCN, the Genesis Communications Radio Network.
[00:58:51.243 --> 00:59:02.869]  With health threats on the rise such as West Nile virus, MRSA, CRE, and now the new bird flu recently discovered in China, there has never been a more crucial time to support your immune system.
[00:59:02.869 --> 00:59:16.097]  Supernatural Silver is a revolutionary new silver solution that is clinically shown to be several hundred times more effective than colloidal or ionic silver, and is powerful enough to help protect you and your family.

[00:59:53.668 --> 00:59:56.054]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:59:56.054 --> 00:59:58.862]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[01:00:05.424 --> 01:00:10.246]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[01:00:10.246 --> 01:00:11.827]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.827 --> 01:00:13.387]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.387 --> 01:00:17.569]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.569 --> 01:00:27.973]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:27.973 --> 01:00:29.774]  Alright, we're into the second hour.
[01:00:29.774 --> 01:00:32.255]  Thank you so much for joining us today.
[01:00:33.973 --> 01:00:36.534]  We are here Monday through Friday, 11 a.m.
[01:00:36.534 --> 01:00:37.655]  to 2 p.m.
[01:00:37.655 --> 01:00:43.638]  Central, obviously, Obama is preparing, if this continues to go this direction, for his water loop.
[01:00:44.728 --> 01:00:47.009]  Uh, his, uh, Trenton.
[01:00:47.009 --> 01:00:49.411]  Uh, his, uh, Battle of the Bulge.
[01:00:49.411 --> 01:00:52.592]  Uh, what does that say for the collectivists, though, and why is that happening?
[01:00:52.592 --> 01:00:53.693]  That's why I've opened the phones up.
[01:00:53.693 --> 01:00:56.314]  I'd like to get your take on it.
[01:00:56.314 --> 01:00:57.255]  800-259-9231.
[01:00:57.255 --> 01:01:00.636]  I do have the Russia, uh, to expel U.S.
[01:01:00.636 --> 01:01:02.117]  CIA operative, they're saying.
[01:01:02.117 --> 01:01:05.919]  Uh, we're gonna talk about police shootings up all over the country.
[01:01:05.919 --> 01:01:08.701]  Actual crime rates are way down, but police shootings are way up.
[01:01:09.321 --> 01:01:10.941]  So we're going to look at why is that?
[01:01:10.941 --> 01:01:15.942]  And I know the answer, at least the biggest portion of the answer, a lot of contributing factors.
[01:01:15.942 --> 01:01:23.124]  The latest on Syria, the latest on the abortion, Dr. Kermit found guilty, a real victory for liberty.
[01:01:23.124 --> 01:01:25.864]  These were babies outside the womb that were viable.
[01:01:25.864 --> 01:01:29.605]  They'd have to drown and now convicted or chop up.
[01:01:29.605 --> 01:01:32.405]  So that's coming up as well.
[01:01:32.405 --> 01:01:35.486]  Let's go to the next caller.
[01:01:35.486 --> 01:01:36.506]  Who's up next here, John?
[01:01:40.270 --> 01:01:44.893]  Gerald Dean in New York, you're on the air.
[01:01:44.893 --> 01:01:46.774]  Hi Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[01:01:46.774 --> 01:01:51.597]  A listener for almost two years and I subscribe to Infowars magazine.
[01:01:51.597 --> 01:01:52.418]  Thank you.
[01:01:52.418 --> 01:02:04.005]  And I've been awakened for 15 years now and I don't think that Barack Obama is going to take the fall because there are too many people on his side.
[01:02:04.005 --> 01:02:05.346]  How do you think he got re-elected?
[01:02:07.554 --> 01:02:17.200]  Well, that's the more cynical view, and I think there's some of that, at least like Hitler in the bunker, they think that, that, oh, let them know we're listening to them.
[01:02:17.200 --> 01:02:19.342]  Let them know we're going to persecute them.
[01:02:19.342 --> 01:02:20.743]  Maybe that'll intimidate everybody.
[01:02:20.743 --> 01:02:29.329]  We've got to normalize the fact that we're going to persecute everybody, because we're in control, nobody can stop us, just like they've persecuted the whistleblowers.
[01:02:29.329 --> 01:02:31.870]  You would think that would turn the whole press against Obama.
[01:02:31.870 --> 01:02:37.454]  I mean, if Nixon or Reagan or Bush tried something like this, or Clinton even, it would be the end of them.
[01:02:38.054 --> 01:02:43.897]  I mean, the hardcore persecution of whistleblowers in the press, some would say that it's a panoptagon effect.
[01:02:43.897 --> 01:02:52.201]  That's a French system that have a tower in the middle of a circular cell block, three stories, was the first French model of this.
[01:02:52.201 --> 01:02:57.483]  You guys pull up a panoptagon prison and click Google or startpage.com, it'll have the images.
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:04.223]  They had jail guards watching, so you felt like you were always being watched.
[01:03:04.223 --> 01:03:05.803]  You didn't have privacy.
[01:03:05.803 --> 01:03:13.227]  You had bars instead of a steel door to make you feel dehumanized and to make you feel like you were always being watched.
[01:03:13.227 --> 01:03:19.931]  So even when you weren't being watched, or even if they were watching, they couldn't enforce on everybody, but you would then self-censor yourself.
[01:03:19.931 --> 01:03:24.474]  So there could be a panopticonic effect.
[01:03:24.474 --> 01:03:28.856]  Well, I know you think I sound cynical, but I just
[01:03:29.488 --> 01:03:38.652]  I have seen it happen so many times since Clinton and all the things that he did and his wife, of course, and they never, nothing ever happened to them.
[01:03:38.652 --> 01:03:41.093]  Look how many people that they know are dead.
[01:03:41.093 --> 01:03:45.294]  I mean, how, how many people that you know... Arkansided, you mean?
[01:03:45.294 --> 01:03:49.816]  Arkansided that... Right?
[01:03:49.816 --> 01:03:50.516]  No, no, I hear you.
[01:03:50.516 --> 01:03:53.298]  I'm just distracted by listening to myself in the background.
[01:03:53.298 --> 01:03:56.679]  Um... And I, you know, I have been...
[01:03:57.392 --> 01:04:09.317]  Listening for a long time and about 15 years ago if I could tell you just quickly tell you this story how I became awakened I started taking red rice extract and for four years.
[01:04:09.317 --> 01:04:22.903]  I brought my cholesterol number way down and Of course that goes against the pharmaceutical company so of course the FDA pulled it from the market so as soon as they did that I was I was awakened to their scam and
[01:04:24.406 --> 01:04:26.527]  Well, they certainly don't want you to have choices.
[01:04:26.527 --> 01:04:28.368]  I mean, that's what it's all about.
[01:04:28.368 --> 01:04:31.250]  They tell you what to do, which is a form of slavery.
[01:04:31.250 --> 01:04:34.611]  They tell you, you know, how to think, where to live, who to be.
[01:04:34.611 --> 01:04:38.353]  They lay out four or five different versions of who you can be.
[01:04:38.353 --> 01:04:45.117]  You can be a neocon, you can be a liberal, you can be a progressive, you can be a couch potato.
[01:04:45.117 --> 01:04:46.978]  Hey, how about I don't want to be any of those?
[01:04:46.978 --> 01:04:51.520]  How about I want to be free, informed, involved, aggressive, loving life?
[01:04:53.641 --> 01:04:55.283]  What does Ted Nugent say?
[01:04:55.283 --> 01:04:57.905]  Workin' hard, playin' hard, America!
[01:04:57.905 --> 01:04:58.526]  Hold it right there.
[01:05:00.754 --> 01:05:07.978]  A little over a year ago, I began to do a lot of research into why, even though I had a pretty good-sized meal, that I was still starving.
[01:05:07.978 --> 01:05:25.869]  And my research led me to a well-known fact that most of the soils that we grow our crops on here in the United States and across the industrialized world are almost completely depleted of almost all of the key minerals and trace elements that our bodies need to rebuild themselves, fight off cancer, and be healthy.
[01:05:25.869 --> 01:05:29.991]  I then searched out the best vitamin and mineral company out there.
[01:05:30.251 --> 01:05:33.473]  I've lost 37 pounds in two months simply getting the vitamins and minerals I need.
[01:06:00.491 --> 01:06:02.372]  Introducing Pro-1.

[01:07:00.208 --> 01:07:03.231]  Alex Jones here with a message to fellow freedom lovers.
[01:07:03.231 --> 01:07:08.256]  The prognosis for the entire planetary economic system runs from bad to worse.
[01:07:08.256 --> 01:07:15.423]  The globalist model is to shut down societies and starve patriots out until they acquiesce to the global takeover.
[01:07:15.563 --> 01:07:21.188]  That's why we've assembled the most vital and important preparedness items at InfoWarsShop.com.
[01:07:21.188 --> 01:07:25.212]  These are items that I did research on, that I personally use.
[01:07:25.212 --> 01:07:29.937]  You've got the LifeStraw, so you can turn fetid water into safe water anywhere you go.
[01:07:29.937 --> 01:07:35.162]  The KTOR Hand Crank Generator, to charge up key equipment during power outages or out in the field.
[01:07:35.402 --> 01:07:38.644]  Strategic Relocation 3rd Edition by Joel Skousen.
[01:07:38.644 --> 01:07:41.146]  When Disaster Strikes by Matthew Stein.
[01:07:41.146 --> 01:07:45.908]  Therosafe used by Homeland Security to protect yourself during any radiological event.
[01:07:45.908 --> 01:07:48.790]  Hand-cranked shortwave AM FM radios.
[01:07:48.790 --> 01:07:55.995]  Everything that we've researched and found to be the best is available at Infowarshop.com and your purchase makes our Infowar possible.
[01:07:55.995 --> 01:07:57.275]  We're getting prepared.
[01:07:57.275 --> 01:07:57.936]  Are you?
[01:07:57.936 --> 01:07:58.716]  Infowarshop.com
[01:08:07.358 --> 01:08:18.222]  In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military-industrial complex.
[01:08:18.222 --> 01:08:24.125]  In Dallas, Texas, three shots were fired at President Kennedy's motorcade in downtown Dallas.
[01:08:24.125 --> 01:08:30.187]  The first reports say that President Kennedy has been seriously wounded by this shooting.
[01:08:30.187 --> 01:08:32.728]  It is a big idea.
[01:08:32.728 --> 01:08:33.689]  A new world order.
[01:08:37.381 --> 01:08:40.403]  It was almost as if it were a planned implosion.
[01:08:40.403 --> 01:08:41.763]  It's just pancakes.
[01:08:41.763 --> 01:08:48.127]  Either you were with us, or you were with the terrorists.
[01:09:01.308 --> 01:09:07.303]  But I also believe that a lot of gun owners would agree that AK-47s belong in the hands of soldiers, not in the hands of criminals.
[01:09:11.497 --> 01:09:12.358]  Guns will be taken.
[01:09:12.358 --> 01:09:13.358]  No one will be able to be armed.
[01:09:13.358 --> 01:09:15.119]  We're going to take all the guns.
[01:09:15.119 --> 01:09:19.982]  For many of the police and guard troops, it is an uncomfortable job to do this in an American city.
[01:09:19.982 --> 01:09:21.503]  Global governance at last.
[01:09:21.503 --> 01:09:22.503]  Is it one world?
[01:09:22.503 --> 01:09:24.184]  The central bank is in charge.
[01:09:24.184 --> 01:09:27.767]  But aren't we all just living and dying for what the central banks do?
[01:09:27.767 --> 01:09:30.848]  As for me, give me liberty or give me death!
[01:09:30.848 --> 01:09:38.773]  Live from the InfoWars.com studios, it's Alex Jones.
[01:09:42.759 --> 01:09:45.140]  We are well into our number two today.
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:46.801]  Thank you so much for joining us.
[01:09:46.801 --> 01:09:52.364]  We're going to continue with open phones throughout this hour, looking at Watergate 2.0.
[01:09:52.364 --> 01:10:09.654]  I mean, Benghazi, the IRS persecuting and spying and unconstitutionally demanding records of people that had attended Tea Party meetings as a secret police stomping around, getting in everybody's face.
[01:10:09.654 --> 01:10:10.835]  This is just some
[01:10:12.864 --> 01:10:15.166]  Of what's going on right now and unfolding.
[01:10:15.166 --> 01:10:19.449]  This is just a small, a small sampling.
[01:10:19.449 --> 01:10:22.791]  And I want to run through some of these headlines now and then go directly to your calls.
[01:10:22.791 --> 01:10:30.276]  800-259-9231 is the toll free number to join us.
[01:10:30.276 --> 01:10:32.278]  Let's look at some of these headlines right here.
[01:10:32.278 --> 01:10:39.703]  The White House says it had no idea the DOJ had seized AP phone records.
[01:10:41.793 --> 01:10:42.994]  Unbelievable.
[01:10:42.994 --> 01:10:48.256]  Mitch McConnell, Senate leader, says that a lot more is coming.
[01:10:48.256 --> 01:10:50.297]  This is only the beginning.
[01:10:50.297 --> 01:11:01.663]  Government probe obtains wide swath of AP phone records, AP reporting on that, to track journalists talking to whistleblowers who are exposing criminal wrongdoing.
[01:11:01.663 --> 01:11:06.066]  Criminals at the Justice Department running defense for the White House
[01:11:07.093 --> 01:11:10.994]  And the White House says they know nothing.
[01:11:10.994 --> 01:11:14.175]  I know nothing.
[01:11:14.175 --> 01:11:16.136]  You don't know that's from Hogan's Heroes, folks.
[01:11:16.136 --> 01:11:23.018]  Under sweeping subpoenas, Justice Department obtained AP phone records in leak investigation.
[01:11:23.018 --> 01:11:23.978]  Drudge comes out.
[01:11:26.038 --> 01:11:31.060]  Matt Drudgen says, warning to reporters and sources, assume all your communications are being monitored.
[01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:33.701]  Time to move back to the parking garage.
[01:11:33.701 --> 01:11:38.003]  I posted this on InfoWars.com and people were like, what does he mean the parking garage?
[01:11:38.003 --> 01:11:41.904]  That's where Deep Throat would meet with Woodward and Bernstein.
[01:11:41.904 --> 01:11:46.386]  The parking garage, because it's noisy and it doesn't tend to be bugged.
[01:11:46.386 --> 01:11:50.048]  In the old days, the FBI had the NSA dialing into your phone.
[01:11:52.210 --> 01:11:58.099]  You ever pick up your phone and it's like off the hook, but you put it on the hook and it's just sitting there like somebody's on the line?
[01:11:58.099 --> 01:11:59.662]  That's the old way to tap your phone.
[01:11:59.662 --> 01:12:02.606]  Now that can happen naturally too, but uh...
[01:12:04.076 --> 01:12:05.037]  Rarely.
[01:12:05.037 --> 01:12:07.600]  So there you have that tweet.
[01:12:07.600 --> 01:12:11.143]  You can follow us, by the way, at RealAlexJones.
[01:12:11.143 --> 01:12:16.628]  And you can follow Drudge at Drudge, that's his personal Drudge, and he's got his Drudge Report, one that's bigger.
[01:12:16.628 --> 01:12:17.850]  Okay, continuing.
[01:12:17.850 --> 01:12:21.733]  White House Responds to Justice Department Secretly Attaining Phone Records.
[01:12:21.733 --> 01:12:24.136]  Again, we are not involved.
[01:12:24.136 --> 01:12:28.240]  As I just mentioned, liberals defend Obama for spying on the media.
[01:12:29.833 --> 01:12:36.477]  After years of attacking Bush for it, which was wrong, which we attacked him for, he got caught with some warrantless wiretapping.
[01:12:36.477 --> 01:12:39.278]  It was almost curtains.
[01:12:39.278 --> 01:12:52.566]  Now they're doing it to the media on a much wider scale and the usual suspects of ThinkProgress, I mean, you know, Soros, Obama, par excellence group, are saying, hey, we need to do this.
[01:12:52.566 --> 01:12:53.846]  It's no big deal.
[01:12:53.846 --> 01:12:54.647]  It's no big deal.
[01:12:55.879 --> 01:13:02.561]  So continuing here, Rand Paul says AP phone spying proves Obama is drunk on power.
[01:13:02.561 --> 01:13:06.802]  I will play that at the bottom of the hour after we take some calls.
[01:13:06.802 --> 01:13:09.823]  And leaked documents shifting into IRS.
[01:13:09.823 --> 01:13:14.024]  IRS targeting conservatives in what media called conspiracy.
[01:13:14.024 --> 01:13:22.626]  And then we link back in this InfoWars.com article by Anthony Giuriardi to where this was reported by the alternative media years ago.
[01:13:24.122 --> 01:13:33.427]  Continuing, IRS scrutiny went beyond Tea Party, targeting of conservative groups broader than thought, Fox News is reporting.
[01:13:33.427 --> 01:13:37.188]  And that's all in the Inspector General's own report.
[01:13:37.188 --> 01:13:38.489]  This is confirmed.
[01:13:38.489 --> 01:13:42.551]  Obama says he didn't know, they need to look into it at the Justice Department.
[01:13:42.551 --> 01:13:46.293]  They're the people doing this at the Justice Department.
[01:13:48.003 --> 01:13:54.108]  Continuing, Benghazi, IRS the son of Watergate, asks the Chicago Tribune.
[01:13:54.108 --> 01:14:01.133]  I know I'd say it's Watergate squared to the next power.
[01:14:01.133 --> 01:14:04.795]  George Will says, IRS scandal echoes of Watergate.
[01:14:04.795 --> 01:14:07.217]  It's a lot more than that.
[01:14:07.217 --> 01:14:13.982]  Same IRS that targeted conservatives will now demand your private health insurance records and your entire database.
[01:14:15.614 --> 01:14:17.896]  of your prescriptions.
[01:14:17.896 --> 01:14:22.158]  The good old IRS of enemies list running that.
[01:14:22.158 --> 01:14:24.880]  IRS head Stephen Miller, mistakes were made.
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:34.326]  Hey, maybe I can go out and drive my Dodge Charger.
[01:14:34.326 --> 01:14:35.506]  The speedometer goes to 200.
[01:14:35.506 --> 01:14:38.068]  I haven't had it up to that.
[01:14:38.068 --> 01:14:41.410]  I won't say what I've had it up to, but it's pretty shameful that I would do something like that.
[01:14:42.213 --> 01:14:46.794]  Let's say the cops pull me over going 170 miles an hour.
[01:14:46.794 --> 01:14:48.414]  170 miles an hour.
[01:14:48.414 --> 01:14:49.255]  Only once.
[01:14:49.255 --> 01:14:49.775]  I'm joking.
[01:14:49.775 --> 01:14:51.155]  I'm trying to act tough, folks.
[01:14:51.155 --> 01:14:52.195]  I didn't do that.
[01:14:52.195 --> 01:14:54.676]  Anyway, I had brand new tires on when I did it, okay?
[01:14:54.676 --> 01:14:55.916]  Anyway, it's awesome.
[01:14:55.916 --> 01:14:59.697]  The light bulbs are going... Kickstart my heart, man!
[01:14:59.697 --> 01:15:03.318]  I get high, I get high on speed!
[01:15:03.318 --> 01:15:03.578]  Top!
[01:15:04.366 --> 01:15:06.368]  You'll find a cause a drug for me.
[01:15:06.368 --> 01:15:07.609]  My heart, my heart!
[01:15:07.609 --> 01:15:08.990]  Kickstart my heart!
[01:15:08.990 --> 01:15:14.434]  Anyways, and when the cops pull me over, I'll just say, Officer, I don't want to be arrested for reckless driving.
[01:15:14.434 --> 01:15:16.016]  I was in control of the vehicle.
[01:15:16.016 --> 01:15:18.017]  You know, this is an Autobahn-style road here.
[01:15:18.017 --> 01:15:19.759]  They go 200 on the Autobahn.
[01:15:19.759 --> 01:15:22.141]  Officer, I made a mistake!
[01:15:22.141 --> 01:15:25.564]  Well, then, Alex, you can go free.
[01:15:25.564 --> 01:15:26.385]  It's not a mistake.
[01:15:26.385 --> 01:15:28.066]  It's all premeditated.
[01:15:28.066 --> 01:15:29.968]  IRS head Stephen Miller.
[01:15:29.968 --> 01:15:31.329]  Mistakes were made.
[01:15:32.834 --> 01:15:42.877]  IRS officials in Washington were involved in targeting of conservative groups.
[01:15:42.877 --> 01:15:43.957]  Really?
[01:15:43.957 --> 01:15:45.038]  Again, this is from yesterday.
[01:15:45.038 --> 01:15:47.338]  That's the Washington Post, so now it's real.
[01:15:47.338 --> 01:15:52.960]  When we were saying it, it was a conspiracy theory, but senior tax officials knew of extra Tea Party scrutiny.
[01:15:54.755 --> 01:15:56.695]  Well, yeah, they got Democrats out defending it now.
[01:15:56.695 --> 01:15:59.036]  Well, of course we're targeting you bad people!
[01:15:59.036 --> 01:16:03.757]  Top IRS official didn't reveal Tea Party targeting and knew years ago.
[01:16:03.757 --> 01:16:05.417]  Oh, you've now been caught lying.
[01:16:05.417 --> 01:16:05.837]  You knew.
[01:16:05.837 --> 01:16:06.558]  Of course you knew.
[01:16:06.558 --> 01:16:07.518]  Of course you knew.
[01:16:07.518 --> 01:16:08.638]  You ordered it.
[01:16:08.638 --> 01:16:14.059]  IRS employees donated over twice as much to Obama in 2012.
[01:16:14.059 --> 01:16:16.180]  Well, yeah, so did Goldman Sachs.
[01:16:16.180 --> 01:16:18.920]  You guys are big idiots, aren't you?
[01:16:18.920 --> 01:16:21.521]  All you people that work for the government think you're winners.
[01:16:21.521 --> 01:16:22.161]  You're losers.
[01:16:24.129 --> 01:16:26.190]  I mean, if you work for the government, that's one issue.
[01:16:26.190 --> 01:16:31.554]  But if you actually think you're on some winning team because you do, and that you're against us, you're morons.
[01:16:31.554 --> 01:16:33.956]  Exclusive McConnell, the IRS revelations just at the beginning.
[01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:43.303]  I already mentioned that, but there's the Breitbart article on that with his quotes by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.
[01:16:43.303 --> 01:16:51.690]  Reveal the 55 questions the IRS asked one Tea Party group after more than two years of waiting, including demands for names of all its donors and volunteers.
[01:16:52.853 --> 01:17:00.537]  Secret Police University to bestow face of IRS scandal with I with honorary tribute.
[01:17:00.537 --> 01:17:04.720]  The woman in charge of all this illegal activity is to be given an award.
[01:17:04.720 --> 01:17:08.802]  An award for American activities.
[01:17:08.802 --> 01:17:20.349]  Yes, the woman in charge of the IRS division responsible for reviewing tax exempt status applications to harass and who's the heart of the ongoing scandal over revelations of agency targeting conservatives just like the head of
[01:17:22.159 --> 01:17:25.300]  The Environmental Protection Agency and all these other people getting in trouble.
[01:17:25.300 --> 01:17:30.942]  Targeted conservative groups is set to receive an honorary tribute from Western New England University School of Law.
[01:17:30.942 --> 01:17:40.825]  Lois Lerner, director of the IRS Exempt Organization Division, was slated to deliver the school's commencement address and be given the university's President's Medallion.
[01:17:40.825 --> 01:17:43.366]  Oh, the President's Medallion.
[01:17:43.366 --> 01:17:47.687]  Why don't we give Obama a hundred more peace prizes while we're at it?
[01:17:49.434 --> 01:17:51.517]  Sure, put them in Cracker Jack boxes.
[01:17:51.517 --> 01:17:55.481]  That would give it actually more value than this.
[01:17:55.481 --> 01:18:00.407]  Let me get some other news and we're going to come back with Joanne Ismood.
[01:18:01.883 --> 01:18:02.863]  It's a mood.
[01:18:02.863 --> 01:18:07.625]  Tony and Lynn and others and our phone system's got some phone lines down for some reason.
[01:18:07.625 --> 01:18:10.707]  I think they're going to reboot the phone system after I take these calls.
[01:18:10.707 --> 01:18:12.247]  So we'll reopen the phones after that.
[01:18:12.247 --> 01:18:14.648]  I'm gonna go to your calls after the break.
[01:18:14.648 --> 01:18:16.429]  Here is some news we already knew.
[01:18:16.429 --> 01:18:19.130]  This actually came out under Tony Blair, but it's in the Daily Mail today.
[01:18:19.130 --> 01:18:20.110]  Immigrants.
[01:18:20.110 --> 01:18:25.853]  We sent out search parties to get them to come and made it hard for Britons to get work, says Mandelson.
[01:18:27.814 --> 01:18:33.397]  Labour sent out, that's the communist in England, search parties for immigrants to get them to come to the UK.
[01:18:33.397 --> 01:18:39.480]  Lord Mandelson has admitted as part of a Labour plan under Blair and continuing under Gordon Brown.
[01:18:39.480 --> 01:18:41.161]  What do you think our government does?
[01:18:41.161 --> 01:18:43.983]  They give welfare to illegals that citizens can't give.
[01:18:43.983 --> 01:18:50.726]  They give tuition to illegals, free tuition or in-state tuition, citizens can't get.
[01:18:50.726 --> 01:18:54.048]  And they're above the law because they want to drive down the wages.
[01:18:54.048 --> 01:18:55.269]  They don't want to help the immigrants.
[01:18:57.113 --> 01:19:01.354]  They want to make us as poor as Ukraine or as poor as Mexico.
[01:19:01.354 --> 01:19:02.775]  Listen, I know how the universe works.
[01:19:02.775 --> 01:19:11.477]  I want Mexicans to be rich and prosperous with firearms and their kids healthy and not being used as a toxic waste dump ground.
[01:19:11.477 --> 01:19:15.098]  I want people in Nigeria to be successful and healthy.
[01:19:15.098 --> 01:19:17.039]  I want prosperity.
[01:19:17.039 --> 01:19:21.600]  They try to sell it that, oh, you're not having hospitality if you don't want open borders.
[01:19:21.600 --> 01:19:23.041]  Mexico has collapsed.
[01:19:23.746 --> 01:19:30.351]  I'm talking about Mexico, because it's 80% or more of the illegals, and now they're coming out.
[01:19:30.351 --> 01:19:33.313]  In the DREAM Act, he's already frozen most of the deportations.
[01:19:33.313 --> 01:19:36.876]  They're all ready, and it's like, oh, isn't that sweet?
[01:19:36.876 --> 01:19:40.078]  Mexico dumps its criminals on the United States.
[01:19:40.078 --> 01:19:41.919]  Oh, you're fleeing from a murder down there?
[01:19:41.919 --> 01:19:44.041]  Just come here and kill people.
[01:19:44.041 --> 01:19:44.902]  And who do they mainly kill?
[01:19:44.902 --> 01:19:47.263]  Their own community.
[01:19:47.263 --> 01:19:49.245]  I was talking to an insider last night.
[01:19:50.520 --> 01:19:57.393]  They were telling me about how the Bandidos, and I'd already read this, have a statewide or left alone by the police.
[01:19:57.393 --> 01:19:58.676]  And I was told why as well.
[01:19:58.676 --> 01:19:59.357]  It's just amazing.

[01:20:30.595 --> 01:20:39.921]  We the people grow cotton, weave fabric, engrave ink, embed strips and fibers to protect from counterfeit, then carting to a private bank, having it led back at interest, forcing taxes to service debt.
[01:20:39.921 --> 01:20:40.722]  This capitalism?
[01:20:40.722 --> 01:20:46.986]  Or was Jefferson correct when stating a central bank issuing the public currency is a greater menace to the liberties of the people than a standing army?
[01:20:46.986 --> 01:20:47.807]  Hi, Ted Anderson.
[01:20:47.807 --> 01:20:50.949]  I'm placing a free silver dollar in a book that explains our monetary system.

[01:22:00.973 --> 01:22:04.336]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food, and firearms.
[01:22:04.336 --> 01:22:10.361]  But if you don't have a home security system, then you're missing a critical weapon in your arsenal for home protection.
[01:22:10.361 --> 01:22:14.224]  When you're sleeping or away from home, who's watching out for intruders?
[01:22:14.224 --> 01:22:15.805]  Check out SimpliSafe.

[01:23:00.109 --> 01:23:02.511]  Hey there, my name is Frank Bates.
[01:23:02.511 --> 01:23:05.794]  Do you know the number one most valuable item in a crisis?
[01:23:05.794 --> 01:23:11.380]  Some people think the answer is gold, others think it's a gun, but the correct answer will shock you.
[01:23:11.940 --> 01:23:21.546]  I just created a free video at Crisis123.com that reveals a surprising item that is more valuable than gold in a crisis.
[01:23:21.546 --> 01:23:24.168]  97% of Americans don't have this one critical item.
[01:23:24.168 --> 01:23:26.309]  In fact, they haven't even given it a thought.
[01:23:26.309 --> 01:23:33.814]  And the sad truth is that you may not survive without it when a real crisis hits and a starving mob is right outside your door.
[01:23:33.814 --> 01:23:38.297]  But I have to tell you, it could literally make the difference between life and death for you and your family.
[01:23:38.777 --> 01:23:45.018]  Watch my video at Crisis123.com to discover the number one most valuable item in a crisis.
[01:23:45.018 --> 01:23:46.358]  You'll be shocked.
[01:23:46.358 --> 01:23:51.559]  See the controversial video that thousands of other smart patrons have already seen in the last three months.
[01:23:51.559 --> 01:23:57.040]  Go watch my video now at Crisis123.com before they force me to shut it down.
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:58.401]  Again, that's Crisis123.com.
[01:24:06.471 --> 01:24:11.455]  In 1814, we took a little trip along with Colonel Jackson down to mighty Mississippi.
[01:24:11.455 --> 01:24:15.818]  Alright, I'm going to go to your phone calls, finishing up the motorcycle gang story.
[01:24:29.090 --> 01:24:43.233]  Basically, real motorcycle clubs like Hells Angels, Banditos, things like that, are really used as the go-between for groups like, say, the Vikings in Los Angeles, or the police gang, to go out and carry out criminal activity for them.
[01:24:44.397 --> 01:24:51.600]  And then they'll choose who they think is the nastiest, toughest motorcycle gang to then carry out their operations for them.
[01:24:51.600 --> 01:24:54.822]  That's what the CIA and others, you know, go back to World War II.
[01:24:54.822 --> 01:25:00.164]  They used the Sicilian Mafia and the invasion of, uh, the first invasion for intelligence of Italy.
[01:25:00.164 --> 01:25:01.745]  And that's how it's always worked.
[01:25:02.947 --> 01:25:12.678]  But my example of that is a group like that then gets chosen to work with this power structure because it was particularly violent and aggressive to begin with.
[01:25:12.678 --> 01:25:17.062]  So then your family gets pulled over and you get given tickets and your car searched.
[01:25:17.062 --> 01:25:21.788]  But then if you're in the Bandidos or another outlaw motorcycle gang, then the police all leave you alone.
[01:25:22.762 --> 01:25:29.047]  But you and your family, the housewife gets pulled over, all her stuff thrown all over the place, taken to jail if she's had two beers.
[01:25:29.047 --> 01:25:31.329]  Now what does that tell you about how to be free?
[01:25:31.329 --> 01:25:34.532]  I'm not saying go off and be like the banditos.
[01:25:34.532 --> 01:25:37.975]  You decriminalize the drugs to dry up that entire culture.
[01:25:37.975 --> 01:25:41.878]  But while that's going on, how are you going to be treated laying down to government?
[01:25:41.878 --> 01:25:44.461]  How are you going to be treated acting like a coward?
[01:25:44.461 --> 01:25:47.163]  How are you going to be treated laying down to everybody?
[01:25:48.405 --> 01:25:54.729]  America became great because we didn't lie down and people were scared of us.
[01:25:54.729 --> 01:26:00.193]  Now we think the American flag is a man bent over with a government goblin behind him.
[01:26:00.193 --> 01:26:10.681]  And let me tell you, or an ostrich with its head stuck in the sand, or the TSA with its hand down your wife's pants, that is an act of gang domination of you and your family.
[01:26:10.681 --> 01:26:16.625]  And we will become like Mexico very shortly, a dominated gang-run culture if that continues.
[01:26:18.160 --> 01:26:27.289]  If good people don't get together and assert our rights over the corrupting government and everywhere else, we will all become slaves.
[01:26:27.289 --> 01:26:31.293]  And that's why when the cops pull me over and want to search my car for drugs, I laugh at them.
[01:26:32.093 --> 01:26:33.394]  Number one, you're violating my Fourth Amendment.
[01:26:33.394 --> 01:26:35.035]  Number two, you're fishing for stuff.
[01:26:35.035 --> 01:26:37.777]  Number three, the government ships in and controls the drug trade.
[01:26:37.777 --> 01:26:40.218]  And don't say you don't know that, cop.
[01:26:40.218 --> 01:26:41.399]  What are you giving me a problem for?
[01:26:41.399 --> 01:26:42.560]  I'm just doing my job.
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:43.961]  Doing your job?
[01:26:43.961 --> 01:26:47.523]  You work for a government that doesn't exist and is illegitimate.
[01:26:47.523 --> 01:26:48.124]  Is that clear?
[01:26:50.768 --> 01:26:57.373]  If they ever restore the Republic, abolish the Federal Reserve, get due process back in, it'll be a legitimate government.
[01:26:57.373 --> 01:26:59.896]  Until that point, man, this thing is far gone.
[01:26:59.896 --> 01:27:06.121]  And the only way to restore the Republic is to withdraw your consent from this and to stop recognizing it.
[01:27:06.121 --> 01:27:08.923]  The illegal aliens don't recognize the government.
[01:27:08.923 --> 01:27:10.484]  They're above the law.
[01:27:10.484 --> 01:27:12.306]  Because we have a criminal government.
[01:27:12.306 --> 01:27:18.291]  The only way now to be free is to just... More and more, I realize, this is just... None of it's real.
[01:27:18.291 --> 01:27:19.372]  It's all garbage!
[01:27:20.427 --> 01:27:22.789]  It's all garbage!
[01:27:22.789 --> 01:27:24.570]  And I'm sick of it!
[01:27:24.570 --> 01:27:27.833]  Let's go ahead and talk to Joanne in Arkansas.
[01:27:27.833 --> 01:27:28.894]  Joanne, you're on the air.
[01:27:28.894 --> 01:27:30.135]  Welcome.
[01:27:30.135 --> 01:27:30.936]  Hi, Alex.
[01:27:30.936 --> 01:27:31.496]  Finally.
[01:27:31.496 --> 01:27:33.057]  Nice to get through to you, finally.
[01:27:33.057 --> 01:27:35.079]  Welcome.
[01:27:35.079 --> 01:27:41.504]  Um... They should change the name of this from Watergate 2.0 to Murdergate.
[01:27:41.504 --> 01:27:41.744]  Ooh.
[01:27:41.744 --> 01:27:44.827]  I mean, that's essentially... Ken Cosby, Murdergate.
[01:27:44.827 --> 01:27:45.748]  Oh my God, that's a good idea.
[01:27:47.305 --> 01:27:51.889]  I'm sorry, nobody died during Watergate.
[01:27:51.889 --> 01:27:57.634]  So they're making it seem like, oh, it's just this little bit of Watergate going on.
[01:27:57.634 --> 01:28:01.297]  No, it's a murder.
[01:28:01.297 --> 01:28:03.960]  You're absolutely right.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:06.102]  And the puppets are gonna be...
[01:28:07.458 --> 01:28:11.359]  Taken out, but I'm sure they're not going to go behind the curtain yet.
[01:28:11.359 --> 01:28:21.222]  Well, the only reason the system's upset is because made men, that's what they are in the State Department, that's over the whole thing, over the CIA, you name it, made men were killed.
[01:28:21.222 --> 01:28:23.062]  And that's why the system is so upset, too.
[01:28:23.062 --> 01:28:25.683]  It's like, why did you kill our own people?
[01:28:25.683 --> 01:28:27.984]  Just cover up the missiles you gave Al Qaeda.
[01:28:27.984 --> 01:28:36.526]  I mean, it's so lawless now that our government publicly runs Al Qaeda while weird potbellies grope our wives and children looking for bombs.
[01:28:38.171 --> 01:28:39.831]  Do you see what I'm saying?
[01:28:39.831 --> 01:28:42.232]  Oh, absolutely.
[01:28:42.232 --> 01:28:51.235]  And they will look over this and then say, oh, OK, they killed those people, but they didn't kill the people in Boston.
[01:28:51.235 --> 01:28:52.955]  They didn't kill people on 9-11.
[01:28:52.955 --> 01:28:54.015]  They would never do that.
[01:28:54.015 --> 01:28:56.356]  I mean, why would they?
[01:28:57.662 --> 01:29:00.383]  If they would kill these people, why wouldn't they kill these people?
[01:29:00.383 --> 01:29:06.347]  They estimate the numbers of dead Syrians to be astronomical, over 50,000.
[01:29:06.347 --> 01:29:11.970]  When you look up the number of dead in two and a half years of Syria conflict, no one knows the exact numbers.
[01:29:11.970 --> 01:29:15.051]  Our government is funding that against civilians.
[01:29:15.051 --> 01:29:17.253]  I mean, they're blowing up houses.
[01:29:17.253 --> 01:29:26.678]  They've got a guy, one of the rebel commanders, eating a heart, saying, I'm going to kill all the yellow-white Muslims, which is a minority Muslim group that's peaceful.
[01:29:27.674 --> 01:29:34.996]  You've got an Al-Qaeda guy from Saudi Arabia eating a heart on TV saying, I'm coming to kill you.
[01:29:34.996 --> 01:29:36.416]  But it doesn't work on the Syrians.
[01:29:36.416 --> 01:29:38.156]  They don't get in a fetal position.
[01:29:38.156 --> 01:29:40.697]  They are fighting back and taking their cities back.
[01:29:40.697 --> 01:29:45.478]  Al-Qaeda thinks it's intimidating Americans or something that roll over and urinate all over themselves.
[01:29:45.478 --> 01:29:46.438]  It's not what's happening.
[01:29:46.438 --> 01:29:47.559]  They're fighting Hezbollah.
[01:29:47.559 --> 01:29:50.239]  Hezbollah is defeating them.
[01:29:50.239 --> 01:29:51.640]  We're on the march.
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:54.160]  The empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.160 --> 01:29:56.841]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[01:32:00.632 --> 01:32:02.573]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:32:02.573 --> 01:32:04.734]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:32:04.734 --> 01:32:10.456]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:32:10.456 --> 01:32:14.498]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:32:14.498 --> 01:32:18.440]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:19.820]  The fact is, you are.
[01:32:19.820 --> 01:32:20.841]  We all are.
[01:32:20.841 --> 01:32:23.182]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.

[01:33:08.201 --> 01:33:12.563]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:33:12.563 --> 01:33:18.185]  It's Alex Jones coming to you live from the front lines of the InfoWar.
[01:33:35.671 --> 01:33:39.336]  Okay, let's try to run through a bunch of your calls right now.
[01:33:39.336 --> 01:33:42.400]  Then I'm gonna get into the Russia to expel U.S.
[01:33:42.400 --> 01:33:43.562]  diplomat.
[01:33:43.562 --> 01:33:50.451]  I'm gonna get into Dr. Kermit Gosnell found guilty of murdering infants in late-term abortions.
[01:33:51.550 --> 01:33:53.872]  We're going to get into the latest from Syria.
[01:33:53.872 --> 01:34:00.577]  Syria conflict, US and UK pledge to bolster opposition so it would intensify.
[01:34:00.577 --> 01:34:03.199]  Al-Qaeda murdering and eating people's hearts on TV.
[01:34:03.199 --> 01:34:05.580]  Literally, there's video of this on Infowars.com.
[01:34:05.580 --> 01:34:06.741]  BBC's covering it.
[01:34:06.741 --> 01:34:07.942]  It's real.
[01:34:07.942 --> 01:34:12.205]  One of the opposition leaders eating hearts saying, I'm going to kill everybody when I take over.
[01:34:12.205 --> 01:34:14.247]  It's totally out of their minds.
[01:34:14.247 --> 01:34:15.528]  And getting defeated, by the way.
[01:34:16.578 --> 01:34:22.041]  Getting defeated by Iranian Hezbollah that's been brought into the country.
[01:34:22.041 --> 01:34:25.403]  Our government's saying they're going to intensify the support of them.
[01:34:25.403 --> 01:34:30.146]  Of course, the ambassador's not going to tell you about the missiles because, well, you know what happened to him in Libya.
[01:34:30.146 --> 01:34:33.508]  So, we're not going to show the video of them eating the heart.
[01:34:33.508 --> 01:34:35.710]  If you want to see it, it's up on InfoWars.com.
[01:34:35.710 --> 01:34:41.233]  I've got some breaking gun news that we'll cover at the start of the next segment.
[01:34:42.808 --> 01:34:52.794]  I have some breaking news where legislators have been caught on a hot mic that they didn't turn off about after they register, they're going to confiscate.
[01:34:52.794 --> 01:34:59.918]  The mayor pro-team here in Austin, Mike Martinez, just says, we're going to register and then take all your guns, and then laughs at people.
[01:34:59.918 --> 01:35:02.520]  I mean, it's, it's, yeah, we're going to register and take your guns.
[01:35:02.520 --> 01:35:04.461]  Of course, I'm not giving mine up, slave!
[01:35:07.622 --> 01:35:19.536]  By the way, the Austin police chief was in here, and we've been too busy to get around to showing this, and he said, oh, your guy at the gun rally, who wasn't our guy, you know, he cussed at Mike Martinez to get him to say that.
[01:35:20.447 --> 01:35:24.371]  It was their guy cussing, and we have it in high def with the audio showing it.
[01:35:24.371 --> 01:35:34.322]  I'm going to show the police chief saying that, and then I'm going to cut to the anti-gun saying it, and the police chief then telling me I was wrong on air, and smiling, playing little tricks.
[01:35:34.322 --> 01:35:40.849]  I mean, maybe he's wrong, maybe Slick Arte Cerveda is wrong, but...
[01:35:41.690 --> 01:35:44.331]  Next time he's in, I'll have that piece for him.
[01:35:44.331 --> 01:35:48.292]  I'm just reminding the reporters back there to go back to the last interview and then show that.
[01:35:48.292 --> 01:35:50.212]  Because that's the type of games they play.
[01:35:50.212 --> 01:36:03.976]  Speaking of games, Obama is running around persecuting people and spying on people and spying without warrants and going after Tea Party gribs and lying about Benghazi.
[01:36:03.976 --> 01:36:07.717]  And it's really waking people up that, wow, he did lie to us.
[01:36:07.717 --> 01:36:11.198]  I thought he was a really sweet liberal doing the best job he could do.
[01:36:13.629 --> 01:36:14.729]  Because of the Republicans.
[01:36:14.729 --> 01:36:18.171]  You know, the Republicans are so bad, Obama has to do this.
[01:36:18.171 --> 01:36:24.313]  And then when Republicans get in, it'll be, the Democrats are so bad, we've got to let the Republicans violate our rights.
[01:36:24.313 --> 01:36:27.935]  Because, you know, if we don't, then the Democrats will get in.
[01:36:27.935 --> 01:36:30.136]  How about we get Constitutionalists in?
[01:36:30.136 --> 01:36:35.058]  How about we get rid of Republicans that don't act like Ted Cruz and Rand Paul?
[01:36:35.058 --> 01:36:35.598]  How's that sound?
[01:36:36.318 --> 01:36:47.139]  Speaking of Rand Paul, here's an excerpt of the full article up on Infowars.com where Rand Paul says that Obama is becoming drunk on power.
[01:36:48.651 --> 01:36:57.899]  Lincoln said, he says, you know, nearly any man can be tested and maybe meet up to adversity, but if you really want to test a man, give him power.
[01:36:57.899 --> 01:37:06.265]  I think in that sense, the president's failing that test of power, because he has extraordinary power and he's supposed to be able to be wise enough to restrain himself.
[01:37:06.265 --> 01:37:11.610]  But he's using the power of government to investigate his enemies, he's tapping the phones of the press,
[01:37:12.370 --> 01:37:20.419]  And it turns out last year he signed legislation that allows him to detain an American without a trial and send them to Guantanamo Bay.
[01:37:20.419 --> 01:37:25.123]  This sounds like a president somewhat drunk on power, not cautious about how he uses power.
[01:37:25.123 --> 01:37:27.005]  Alright.
[01:37:27.005 --> 01:37:28.267]  Drunk on power.
[01:37:28.267 --> 01:37:30.949]  And good job Rand bringing up NDAA.
[01:37:31.943 --> 01:37:33.544]  And again, I've learned Obama's tactics.
[01:37:33.544 --> 01:37:34.425]  They're not hard.
[01:37:34.425 --> 01:37:41.309]  His White House lawyers, Justice Department, the criminal department, they write the NDAA to secretly disappear at the end of the night.
[01:37:41.309 --> 01:37:43.591]  The media then lies and says it doesn't say that.
[01:37:43.591 --> 01:37:46.473]  The constitutional lawyers look at it and know it does.
[01:37:46.473 --> 01:37:49.375]  Then Obama comes out and criticizes it and says it does.
[01:37:49.375 --> 01:37:50.936]  I will veto it.
[01:37:50.936 --> 01:37:52.036]  Then it comes out he wrote it.
[01:37:52.036 --> 01:37:55.599]  Then I say, folks, the veto threat is to kill opposition.
[01:37:55.599 --> 01:37:56.319]  This is elementary.
[01:37:56.319 --> 01:37:59.481]  Everybody's like, Alex, he's going to veto it.
[01:37:59.481 --> 01:38:01.643]  And then he signs it on New Year's Eve two years ago.
[01:38:03.578 --> 01:38:07.641]  At like six o'clock at night, when nobody's paying attention.
[01:38:07.641 --> 01:38:09.883]  Was it like a Saturday night?
[01:38:09.883 --> 01:38:12.085]  And then I still have debates with people.
[01:38:12.085 --> 01:38:14.527]  Obama's not persecuting whistleblowers.
[01:38:14.527 --> 01:38:16.829]  Obama's not going after the guns.
[01:38:16.829 --> 01:38:18.450]  Nobody wants your guns, Alex.
[01:38:18.450 --> 01:38:20.792]  Piers Morgan, no one wants to take your guns.
[01:38:20.792 --> 01:38:21.273]  Really?
[01:38:21.273 --> 01:38:23.354]  I'm in a city where you took all the guns.
[01:38:23.354 --> 01:38:25.776]  Everywhere you crooks are in control, you take the guns.
[01:38:25.776 --> 01:38:29.480]  You usurper over here trying to take my Bill of Rights and Constitution.
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:31.942]  By the way, Piers Morgan's a crook.
[01:38:31.942 --> 01:38:43.471]  He was over multiple newspapers planning fake news stories and is clearly, they've had courts rule, was deceptive and his underlings have all gone to jail for illegal phone hacking.
[01:38:43.471 --> 01:38:52.179]  But when I say he's a crook, I say he's a crook because he's over here in my country trying to overthrow my Bill of Rights and make me a slave.
[01:38:52.179 --> 01:38:53.320]  That's beyond being a crook.
[01:38:53.320 --> 01:38:55.221]  He's an enemy operative.
[01:38:55.221 --> 01:38:57.223]  But hey, he's already dying politically.
[01:38:58.442 --> 01:38:59.363]  Have you seen the graph?
[01:38:59.363 --> 01:39:00.985]  We showed it yesterday.
[01:39:00.985 --> 01:39:02.607]  He was a million viewers a year ago.
[01:39:02.607 --> 01:39:05.250]  600,000 six months ago.
[01:39:05.250 --> 01:39:06.371]  500,000 a month ago.
[01:39:06.371 --> 01:39:07.913]  400,000 now.
[01:39:07.913 --> 01:39:10.295]  At current rates, he will have 200,000, maybe 300,000 viewers in six months a year.
[01:39:10.295 --> 01:39:10.796]  I mean, what a joke!
[01:39:19.372 --> 01:39:23.094]  What a legend in his own mind.
[01:39:23.094 --> 01:39:29.736]  And again, I harp on this because these people, look at who the establishment thought we would want.
[01:39:29.736 --> 01:39:33.958]  Some hatchet man, insider trading manipulator.
[01:39:37.186 --> 01:39:41.488]  Full of fake elitism and snobbery.
[01:39:41.488 --> 01:39:45.389]  That's what CNN execs, that's what they think is going to win.
[01:39:45.389 --> 01:39:52.611]  That's what they think America wants, is some redcoat lecturing down to us when the Brits hate his guts.
[01:39:52.611 --> 01:39:54.492]  By the way, nothing against Brits when I say redcoat.
[01:39:54.492 --> 01:39:58.773]  A redcoat is an imperial soldier in the service of tyranny.
[01:39:58.773 --> 01:40:00.934]  I call our own corrupt government redcoats.
[01:40:02.844 --> 01:40:05.906]  People always try to make it an anti-America, anti-England deal.
[01:40:05.906 --> 01:40:25.257]  The ideas in our revolution came out of Magna Carta, and the Parliament first voted to recognize the colonies, and then the King of England came in and threatened a bunch of stuff and gave a speech to Parliament, and they still narrowly got the votes for the war.
[01:40:25.257 --> 01:40:29.760]  And so my whole issue is, everyone needs to reject red coatism everywhere.
[01:40:31.033 --> 01:40:36.517]  And I mean, if Piers Morgan isn't a red coat scumbag, nobody is.
[01:40:36.517 --> 01:40:37.917]  Let's talk to Lynn in Georgia.
[01:40:37.917 --> 01:40:40.859]  Thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:40:40.859 --> 01:40:41.500]  Hello.
[01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:42.781]  Hey, Lynn.
[01:40:42.781 --> 01:40:45.222]  Hey.
[01:40:45.222 --> 01:40:59.451]  You may have already covered this, but ever since the Associated Press information came out, I had to ask the question... Hold on a sec.
[01:40:59.451 --> 01:41:00.432]  I don't know how to turn that off.
[01:41:02.031 --> 01:41:03.971]  It's alright ma'am, it adds a nice ambiance.
[01:41:03.971 --> 01:41:05.412]  Go ahead and make your point.
[01:41:05.412 --> 01:41:06.112]  Okay.
[01:41:06.112 --> 01:41:24.556]  Ever since I came out, I remember that thing about the earlier secret press conference right before the real press conference where the president selected certain Associated Press reporters to have this little closed door session.
[01:41:24.556 --> 01:41:29.197]  I'm thinking that's where he gave them the heads up that they were getting ready to come out with this.
[01:41:30.285 --> 01:41:31.467]  It's nothing new.
[01:41:31.467 --> 01:41:38.498]  I mean, they'd already told everybody that they've been recording everybody's phone calls and emails.
[01:41:38.498 --> 01:41:39.619]  That's totally illegal.
[01:41:39.619 --> 01:41:43.786]  And again, they just hide the criminality in plain view, like TSA groping your family.
[01:41:43.786 --> 01:41:44.407]  Totally illegal.
[01:41:48.735 --> 01:41:55.399]  Well, ma'am, here's the critical juncture we've come to.
[01:41:55.399 --> 01:42:06.686]  If we just accept they're doing this now that everybody seems to be upset about it, just because something's been going on for a long time, and then people finally get upset, we can't be like, well, you idiots, you know, why didn't you listen to us?
[01:42:06.686 --> 01:42:08.087]  We've got to say, good job!
[01:42:08.087 --> 01:42:12.349]  Now here's the other stuff, because people have to have that awakening moment.
[01:42:12.349 --> 01:42:14.311]  Just because we were awake before others,
[01:42:15.111 --> 01:42:17.852]  Doesn't mean now that we can't ever turn this around.
[01:42:17.852 --> 01:42:20.953]  And I'm not even saying they'll end up being destroyed because of this.
[01:42:20.953 --> 01:42:22.433]  It's a process.
[01:42:22.433 --> 01:42:26.254]  But they're trying to discredit the Liberty Movement.
[01:42:26.254 --> 01:42:30.836]  They're trying to get the public behind their gun control program because they need people power.
[01:42:30.836 --> 01:42:32.396]  We need people power.
[01:42:32.396 --> 01:42:33.576]  And we are for the people.
[01:42:33.576 --> 01:42:37.878]  We are for a new enlightenment, a new renaissance, a
[01:42:39.418 --> 01:42:42.120]  A rediscovery of individualism.
[01:42:42.120 --> 01:42:44.962]  And so we are in a continued war.
[01:42:44.962 --> 01:42:51.146]  And yes, I understand being upset or cynical and going, this has always been going on the last 20, 30 years.
[01:42:51.146 --> 01:42:52.928]  They would just deny it before.
[01:42:52.928 --> 01:42:55.650]  Now they've been throwing it in our face, but they're failing.
[01:42:55.650 --> 01:42:59.412]  The throwing it in the face has caused a backlash.
[01:42:59.412 --> 01:43:03.835]  And so we need to now push that backlash over the edge into a tipping point.
[01:43:03.835 --> 01:43:04.456]  Let me tell you something.
[01:43:05.131 --> 01:43:14.437]  The reason they're getting armored vehicles and billions of bullets and training to do lockdown stuff and take over the communications and internet kill switches is because they're weak.
[01:43:14.437 --> 01:43:21.722]  They have engaged in all this bravado to put on a show of strength because they're really afraid.
[01:43:22.907 --> 01:43:34.523]  Okay, and so I'm telling you, this is real, they're in trouble, and more is going to come, and we need, the Republican leadership will try to contain this, because they don't want to break through the firewalls into them.
[01:43:34.523 --> 01:43:39.751]  I say let the whole thing run its course, I say abolish the Federal Reserve, that's the real people behind all this.
[01:43:40.967 --> 01:43:42.627]  Bring back the Republic.
[01:43:42.627 --> 01:43:48.109]  And again, if we believe it and just persevere, we don't have to win individual battles.
[01:43:48.109 --> 01:43:51.849]  We can lose every battle and win the war, like George Washington.
[01:43:51.849 --> 01:43:54.230]  He lost every battle for like three years.
[01:43:54.230 --> 01:43:54.810]  Okay?
[01:43:54.810 --> 01:43:57.771]  And then only had a few symbolic victories.
[01:43:57.771 --> 01:44:00.371]  We're actually having victories all the time.
[01:44:00.371 --> 01:44:05.792]  And... I mean, you've got me getting off into strategy and things.
[01:44:05.792 --> 01:44:07.933]  What exactly are you getting at here?
[01:44:07.933 --> 01:44:08.753]  I'm getting at...
[01:44:09.545 --> 01:44:30.190]  Talking about winning hearts and minds for the resistance, yesterday I went back and looked at some old movies and I had not seen Brainwashing 101 and I just want to say that my problem with communicating with another generation has been, you know, they've been raised on Marxism and they don't understand what we're saying.
[01:44:30.190 --> 01:44:36.372]  So, college-age students in that video were so
[01:44:38.195 --> 01:44:44.181]  Civil and level-headed and clear-thinking and straightforward.
[01:44:44.181 --> 01:44:49.606]  I was so impressed I was encouraged, number one, but I just want to put a plug in for that video.
[01:44:49.606 --> 01:44:54.871]  If anybody's having trouble communicating with the younger generation, that one will do it.
[01:44:54.871 --> 01:44:55.812]  It's called Brainwashing 101.
[01:44:57.046 --> 01:45:11.461]  Uh-huh, and it talks about these students who were prosecuted, persecuted by the administration of their colleges because they're putting up flyers for a conservative club meeting event on the college campus.
[01:45:11.461 --> 01:45:13.143]  Yeah, that's from 2011.
[01:45:13.143 --> 01:45:14.364]  I've seen that video.
[01:45:14.364 --> 01:45:15.826]  Listen, ma'am, I appreciate your points.
[01:45:17.085 --> 01:45:19.568]  Let me tell you why it's hard to wake up some of the young people.
[01:45:19.568 --> 01:45:28.679]  They've been brought up on television, video games, and now iPads, and iPods, and all this stuff, and the language is shrinking.
[01:45:28.679 --> 01:45:30.502]  They're not communicating with people.
[01:45:33.351 --> 01:45:35.272]  And they don't feel empowered.
[01:45:35.272 --> 01:45:36.593]  They feel scared.
[01:45:36.593 --> 01:45:39.694]  They feel like acting trendy will make them successful.
[01:45:39.694 --> 01:45:42.736]  Then they wonder why there's no jobs and why they're not successful.
[01:45:42.736 --> 01:45:44.757]  So the system says, be a slacker.
[01:45:44.757 --> 01:45:47.738]  You know, just get into your, you know, the fact that you're a failure.
[01:45:47.738 --> 01:45:51.020]  The way you reach out to them is saying, look, you're part of history.
[01:45:51.020 --> 01:45:52.160]  You have a destiny.
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:53.441]  There's a war going on.
[01:45:53.441 --> 01:45:54.782]  You've been lied to.
[01:45:54.782 --> 01:45:56.883]  And you've got to grab them by the shoulders and say,
[01:45:57.583 --> 01:46:10.009]  You've got to realize that there's a future and that you're part of it and that there's a historical war going on and things are actually incredibly interesting.
[01:46:10.009 --> 01:46:16.692]  We've got to give them a idea of the power that they have.
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:25.182]  They just put Carney up on screen from the Communist News Network.
[01:46:25.182 --> 01:46:29.144]  White House says that they need balance on probes.
[01:46:29.144 --> 01:46:33.085]  Says we must weigh freedom versus national security.
[01:46:33.085 --> 01:46:34.726]  You've got to be kidding.
[01:46:34.726 --> 01:46:36.327]  So, so, exactly.
[01:46:36.327 --> 01:46:41.649]  Okay, we're spying on you, but freedom versus national security.
[01:46:41.649 --> 01:46:43.890]  I thought our national security is our freedom.
[01:46:43.890 --> 01:46:46.051]  Oh, you saw the bombing in Boston?
[01:46:46.051 --> 01:46:47.652]  Now we gotta have TSA on the streets.
[01:46:50.532 --> 01:46:56.094]  See how they're just doubling down like con artists?
[01:46:56.094 --> 01:46:59.034]  I mean, unbelievable.
[01:46:59.034 --> 01:47:00.595]  Unbelievable.
[01:47:00.595 --> 01:47:02.175]  Let's go to Tony in Pennsylvania.
[01:47:02.175 --> 01:47:02.755]  Go ahead, Tony.
[01:47:02.755 --> 01:47:05.076]  Alex, how you doing today?
[01:47:05.076 --> 01:47:06.736]  Good, brother.
[01:47:06.736 --> 01:47:11.438]  Hey, I just wanted to make two points quick and then ask you a quick question.
[01:47:11.438 --> 01:47:15.339]  First off, have you ever seen the TV show Burn Notice?
[01:47:15.339 --> 01:47:15.479]  No.
[01:47:16.716 --> 01:47:18.997]  Okay, it's based on a spy who gets burned.
[01:47:18.997 --> 01:47:23.338]  I think basically since, uh, I'm not sure if you said Obama was CIA.
[01:47:23.338 --> 01:47:28.280]  Maybe they're gonna burn him and try and give him an act of redemption.
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:33.882]  Where he's gonna have to try and pull off something big to, uh, basically recover his name within the upper echelons.
[01:47:34.144 --> 01:47:42.730]  Yeah, no, Obama was CIA, he came from a double-sided CIA active duty family on record, but he's above CIA.
[01:47:42.730 --> 01:47:52.296]  He is a foundation, Carnegie, Ford, Rockefeller Foundation, the whole family is above government, criminal network group.
[01:47:52.296 --> 01:47:54.938]  Right, and I agree with you 100%.
[01:47:54.938 --> 01:47:58.080]  My next question would be, I'll just skip my second point.
[01:47:58.080 --> 01:48:00.041]  No, go ahead, go ahead, do them all, brother.
[01:48:00.041 --> 01:48:01.442]  My second question was,
[01:48:03.425 --> 01:48:10.612]  I sent you a thing about a game called Homefront a little while back and basically it's where Korea was unified and invaded the U.S.
[01:48:10.612 --> 01:48:25.968]  Now you couple that with Call of Duty Modern Warfare 1, 2, and 3, basically the United States gets invaded and basically I think they're trying to condition people to that through martial law and also when they bring in the blue helmets for the civil unrest.
[01:48:27.768 --> 01:48:32.551]  Well, it's officially in the Washington Post that they've got deals to bring in foreign U.N.
[01:48:32.551 --> 01:48:34.192]  troops during civil emergency.
[01:48:34.192 --> 01:48:36.013]  It won't be a foreign occupation.
[01:48:36.013 --> 01:48:39.295]  It'll be our friends here helping us.
[01:48:39.295 --> 01:48:44.137]  And there's no doubt they're training for a war with real Americans.
[01:48:44.137 --> 01:48:45.678]  And they're committed to their program.
[01:48:45.678 --> 01:48:49.040]  And there is a war back against them within the system.
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:56.304]  Believe me, I have talked to high-level active-duty Secret Service via somebody else's telephone.
[01:48:56.304 --> 01:48:57.145]  I'll just leave it at that.
[01:48:58.451 --> 01:49:00.053]  Okay, I mean, this is confirmed.
[01:49:00.053 --> 01:49:07.582]  And they said over 90% of the Secret Service absolutely hate Obama.
[01:49:07.582 --> 01:49:10.005]  And the stuff they see going on is why they hate him.
[01:49:10.005 --> 01:49:13.589]  I mean, they say, you know, it is, there's a reason they're scared of leaks.
[01:49:13.589 --> 01:49:14.711]  And I wasn't told anything.
[01:49:15.754 --> 01:49:20.277]  I was just told almost everybody hates them, they know the New World Order is real, and they're all listening.
[01:49:20.277 --> 01:49:22.058]  So I shouldn't make fun of the Secret Service so much.
[01:49:22.058 --> 01:49:23.839]  I mean, look at Bongino who quit.
[01:49:23.839 --> 01:49:25.040]  He was a good guy.
[01:49:25.040 --> 01:49:26.341]  We've had him on.
[01:49:26.341 --> 01:49:27.962]  I tend to bash the system so much.
[01:49:27.962 --> 01:49:29.483]  Look, it's compartmentalized.
[01:49:29.483 --> 01:49:32.405]  It's a bunch of crooks running roughshod.
[01:49:32.405 --> 01:49:37.088]  I mean, you saw the ATF emails and the video where they go, do as you're told.
[01:49:37.088 --> 01:49:42.992]  If you see what you believe is corruption, you can only report it to your superior, no one else, no other agency.
[01:49:42.992 --> 01:49:45.294]  Do what you're told and be obedient.
[01:49:46.595 --> 01:49:53.743]  So, imagine being people in the government, just having to sit there and watch all this crime go on.
[01:49:53.743 --> 01:49:57.768]  I mean, does that answer your question, or what is your question exactly getting at?
[01:49:57.768 --> 01:49:59.930]  Well, basically you brought up that with the Secret Service.
[01:49:59.930 --> 01:50:03.955]  If they know that he's committing these crimes, why don't they just arrest him?
[01:50:05.051 --> 01:50:06.992]  Because that's not how it works.
[01:50:06.992 --> 01:50:22.784]  I mean, as a cop or a federal officer, you've got to have a grand jury and indictment, or you've got to have clear and present danger where the guys, you know, if Obama, you know, they came in and Obama was, you know, killing children, they could arrest him, but then no one would believe them.
[01:50:22.784 --> 01:50:26.967]  The president would say, I'm the president, he was killing the children, and people would believe it.
[01:50:26.967 --> 01:50:29.829]  That's why you've got to discredit them to bring them down.
[01:50:29.829 --> 01:50:31.710]  That's why attacking them is important.
[01:50:34.346 --> 01:50:37.208]  These wars aren't like flip-flip one way or the other.
[01:50:37.208 --> 01:50:39.089]  It's a war.
[01:50:39.089 --> 01:50:41.630]  It goes on and on, on and on and on.
[01:50:41.630 --> 01:50:44.372]  We push back this evil this time, it's like fencing.
[01:50:44.372 --> 01:50:46.553]  It's gonna then regroup and come back at us.
[01:50:46.553 --> 01:50:48.475]  And on and on, on and on and on.
[01:50:48.475 --> 01:50:49.915]  It's heaven and hell.
[01:50:49.915 --> 01:50:52.637]  We'll be right back, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:50:52.637 --> 01:50:56.339]  The devil is never a maker, unless you give.
[01:50:56.339 --> 01:50:57.060]  You're a taker.
[01:51:01.246 --> 01:51:03.188]  In the last two years alone, the U.S.
[01:51:03.188 --> 01:51:06.010]  has seen huge losses to our food supply.
[01:51:06.010 --> 01:51:11.595]  In 2011, storms and floods raged across the U.S., costing us $20 billion in lost crops alone.
[01:51:11.595 --> 01:51:15.038]  In 2012, we saw the largest drought in the country in more than 50 years.
[01:51:15.038 --> 01:51:18.942]  You may think out of sight, out of mind, and so you don't think you will be affected.
[01:51:18.942 --> 01:51:20.323]  The fact is, you are.
[01:51:20.323 --> 01:51:21.344]  We all are.
[01:51:21.344 --> 01:51:23.666]  Food shortages drive prices up for everyone.
[01:51:23.966 --> 01:51:32.448]  You might not be able to control Mother Nature, but you can control your food prices by freezing the cost and availability of your food supply with eFoodsDirect.

[01:51:53.415 --> 01:51:55.457]  I want you to know some very important information.
[01:51:55.457 --> 01:52:02.042]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.

[01:54:22.363 --> 01:54:32.351]  Alright, here's what I'm going to do so that we don't run out of time covering this story.
[01:54:32.351 --> 01:54:36.554]  I'm going to cover it when we start the next hour and then we'll go to our guest.
[01:54:36.554 --> 01:54:39.536]  I want to get to more of your calls right now.
[01:54:39.536 --> 01:54:44.139]  This article has just gone up on Infowars.com with the audio.
[01:54:44.139 --> 01:54:44.520]  Oops!
[01:54:44.520 --> 01:54:47.282]  Hot mic reveals lawmakers' intent to confiscate guns.
[01:54:48.991 --> 01:54:50.232]  And this is in New Jersey.
[01:54:50.232 --> 01:54:55.736]  Every gun owner, regardless of the state in which you live, is presently or will be the target of gun confiscation.
[01:54:55.736 --> 01:55:01.081]  A state-by-state framework of confiscation is being erected in front of us, and it strips us of our rights.
[01:55:02.667 --> 01:55:26.683]  At the conclusion of the New Jersey Senate Budget Appropriations Committee meeting last Thursday, an open microphone caught three state senators identified by voice as Senate Majority Leader Weinberg, Assistant Majority Leader Sandra Cunningham, Majority Whip Leader Greenstein, and at least one staff member talking candidly about their intent to confiscate all guns from the people they serve.
[01:55:26.683 --> 01:55:29.745]  And they're like, so when we come back, that's when we'll reopen it.
[01:55:29.745 --> 01:55:31.607]  And then we'll confiscate their guns.
[01:55:32.527 --> 01:55:35.850]  I'm going to play that coming up the next hour.
[01:55:35.850 --> 01:55:47.499]  That audio and video just went up at InfoWars.com via CanadianFreePress.com and the Northeast Intelligence Network, Doug Hagman.
[01:55:47.499 --> 01:55:54.364]  So, and I mean we've got Dianne Feinstein saying Mr. and Mrs. America, turn them all in.
[01:55:54.364 --> 01:55:56.246]  That's the game plan.
[01:55:56.246 --> 01:55:58.488]  Now before I go to Isamud and
[01:55:59.798 --> 01:56:05.520]  Joshua and Ernest and Nathan and everybody ahead of our guests joining us, and that audio we're going to play for radio listeners.
[01:56:05.520 --> 01:56:10.002]  At the end of this hour, I just want to remind you, I'm building a news operation against the Globalist.
[01:56:10.002 --> 01:56:15.765]  A nightly news, syndicated radio broadcast, films, special reports.
[01:56:15.765 --> 01:56:18.826]  I'm trying to hire more journalists, more camera people, more editors.
[01:56:18.826 --> 01:56:21.087]  Obviously, it costs money.
[01:56:21.087 --> 01:56:23.108]  My goal is liberty and our time.
[01:56:23.108 --> 01:56:23.968]  I'm all in.
[01:56:23.968 --> 01:56:26.029]  I'm committing everything, trying to expand.
[01:56:26.029 --> 01:56:27.770]  I'm, you know, committing
[01:56:28.729 --> 01:56:36.832]  Money I got separately in the last few years, you know, from other family things to this.
[01:56:36.832 --> 01:56:40.354]  I am putting everything I can into the fight against the globalists.
[01:56:41.112 --> 01:56:42.173]  And I need your support.
[01:56:42.173 --> 01:56:48.177]  So go to InfoWarsStore.com or link through via InfoWars.com and buy the books, the t-shirts, the videos.
[01:56:48.177 --> 01:56:50.018]  It all wakes people up too.

[01:57:31.690 --> 01:57:32.251]  Thanks for holding.
[01:57:33.302 --> 01:57:35.863]  Hello, fellow info warrior Alex Jones.
[01:57:35.863 --> 01:57:38.164]  Reporting for duty, sir.
[01:57:38.164 --> 01:57:39.985]  So what's on your mind, buddy?
[01:57:39.985 --> 01:57:47.989]  Well, I have lived in the system for 22 years, and I have seen Benghazigate happen on small scales.
[01:57:47.989 --> 01:57:59.334]  And let me tell you right now, the Goblin King's power blood alcohol level is exceeding .08, and people are finally starting to see it.
[01:57:59.334 --> 01:58:02.476]  I am an info warrior who specializes in stealth, by the way.
[01:58:03.936 --> 01:58:05.357]  Who is the Goblin King?
[01:58:05.357 --> 01:58:06.117]  Janet Reno?
[01:58:06.117 --> 01:58:07.858]  I mean, Rachel Maddow?
[01:58:07.858 --> 01:58:09.720]  What's the name of that guy?
[01:58:09.720 --> 01:58:12.781]  Big Sis, Janet Napolitano?
[01:58:12.781 --> 01:58:17.384]  Yeah, actually she's the Goblin Queen.
[01:58:17.384 --> 01:58:23.208]  Imagine if you crossed Obama and Mr. Napolitano.
[01:58:23.208 --> 01:58:24.429]  Yeah, tell me about it.
[01:58:24.429 --> 01:58:26.170]  Like Eddie Munster.
[01:58:26.170 --> 01:58:28.331]  Yeah, well, worse than that.
[01:58:28.331 --> 01:58:29.292]  Come on, worse than that.
[01:58:30.356 --> 01:58:32.398]  Uh, those are ad hominem attacks, actually.
[01:58:32.398 --> 01:58:41.567]  I think... I think... I mean, I'm not into guys, but I think he's pretty handsome.
[01:58:41.567 --> 01:58:44.029]  You are listening to GCN.
[01:58:44.029 --> 01:58:45.951]  That's Big Sis, he's very handsome.
[01:58:45.951 --> 01:58:47.973]  I like that white spot in his hair.
[01:58:51.514 --> 01:58:52.574]  I had tried everything.
[01:58:52.574 --> 01:58:58.056]  I'd cut back the amount of food I was eating, I was lifting weights and jogging, but nothing was working.
[01:58:58.056 --> 01:59:02.897]  My body was literally starving for minerals and trace elements as well as key vitamins.
[01:59:02.897 --> 01:59:09.259]  And as soon as I had that, I immediately could eat half of what I was eating previously and be satisfied.
[01:59:09.759 --> 01:59:20.973]  Now there are hundreds of great products at Infowarsteam.com, but I want to point out the three that have helped me lose 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:59:20.973 --> 01:59:25.459]  Products like Beyond Tangy Tangerine, Pollen Burst, and Rebound.
[01:59:25.459 --> 01:59:28.463]  When I started taking the Tangy Tangerine and other products every day,
[01:59:28.803 --> 01:59:31.684]  I lost more than 37 pounds in just two months.
[01:59:31.684 --> 01:59:33.264]  Now that's results.
[01:59:33.264 --> 01:59:45.789]  I want to challenge my listeners to go to Infowarsteam.com and to order just three of their products and you will see the changes in the way you look, feel and in your appetite almost immediately.

[01:59:53.962 --> 01:59:56.364]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:56.364 --> 02:00:05.651]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:05.651 --> 02:00:06.952]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.952 --> 02:00:08.733]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.733 --> 02:00:10.474]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.474 --> 02:00:12.055]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.055 --> 02:00:13.997]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.997 --> 02:00:17.800]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.800 --> 02:00:21.883]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:24.833 --> 02:00:30.434]  All right, we're going to get an update on Monsanto and the Supreme Court ruling, continuing with your phone calls.
[02:00:30.434 --> 02:00:33.495]  And I'm going to get into some big gun news at the start of the next segment.
[02:00:33.495 --> 02:00:38.335]  But right now, let's go back to Issa Mood in Minnesota.
[02:00:38.335 --> 02:00:46.957]  OK, you're talking about the incredibly handsome, you say, Goblin King, Big Fish, Cousin It, or what?
[02:00:46.957 --> 02:00:48.197]  I'm going to stop the joke.
[02:00:48.197 --> 02:00:50.038]  I apologize.
[02:00:50.038 --> 02:00:52.118]  Are you referring to Obama as the Goblin King, sir?
[02:00:53.140 --> 02:00:54.860]  Yeah, he is the Goblin King.
[02:00:54.860 --> 02:00:58.081]  If you've ever watched the movie The Hobbit, oh my God!
[02:00:58.081 --> 02:01:01.962]  Yeah, I don't know.
[02:01:01.962 --> 02:01:02.462]  I don't know.
[02:01:02.462 --> 02:01:05.483]  I mean, Goblin King.
[02:01:05.483 --> 02:01:08.703]  So what is your issue on BenghaziGate, all this?
[02:01:08.703 --> 02:01:10.004]  Will it bring Obama down?
[02:01:10.004 --> 02:01:12.024]  What do you think is behind all this?
[02:01:12.024 --> 02:01:16.725]  Okay, his house of cards is going to fall because he's being exposed by his own minions.
[02:01:19.378 --> 02:01:22.564]  I've actually done some work in attempting to expose it myself.
[02:01:22.564 --> 02:01:32.161]  Because right when this story aired and I was sitting in one of Metro Mobility's cars going to work, I thought something was funny about it.
[02:01:32.887 --> 02:01:43.274]  Being that I've lived in the system myself and I've seen people, I've seen people with disabilities get provocateured into doing stuff, and I've seen that kind of stuff go on on a small scale.
[02:01:43.274 --> 02:01:46.816]  I mean, it goes on on a large scale, you just go up the Fibonacci sequence.
[02:01:46.816 --> 02:01:52.280]  So right when I heard about this supposed YouTube video setting off the Muslims, I'm like, that can't be it.
[02:01:53.410 --> 02:01:57.815]  Well, they've been caught lying about it all, and I just think their lies have gotten too big.
[02:01:57.815 --> 02:02:04.163]  And he's outlived his usefulness to the globalists, so probably, um, at least politically damaging to a certain degree.
[02:02:04.163 --> 02:02:07.567]  I mean, not even staging another shooting, that's not even going to save the, uh...
[02:02:08.697 --> 02:02:09.698]  The Goblin Queen.
[02:02:09.698 --> 02:02:13.861]  Actually, I think he's the Goblin Queen and Big Sis is the Goblin King.
[02:02:13.861 --> 02:02:14.661]  Now I figured it out.
[02:02:14.661 --> 02:02:15.842]  Thank you, sir.
[02:02:15.842 --> 02:02:19.004]  Let's talk to Nathan in Kansas.
[02:02:19.004 --> 02:02:20.565]  Yes, we are in Kansas.
[02:02:20.565 --> 02:02:23.347]  Let's talk about the Obama meltdown gate.
[02:02:23.347 --> 02:02:25.069]  Go ahead.
[02:02:25.069 --> 02:02:28.171]  Yeah, hey, thanks for having me on and it's great talking to you.
[02:02:28.171 --> 02:02:29.232]  It's great talking to you, brother.
[02:02:29.232 --> 02:02:30.973]  Listen, we don't have call screeners.
[02:02:30.973 --> 02:02:32.154]  You don't have to thank me for getting you on.
[02:02:32.154 --> 02:02:32.994]  I appreciate you calling.
[02:02:32.994 --> 02:02:34.395]  Go ahead.
[02:02:34.395 --> 02:02:34.836]  Absolutely.
[02:02:38.455 --> 02:02:48.137]  A week ago I went to the DMV to register my truck, a truck that I bought back in 2005 that I'm still paying property tax on.
[02:02:48.137 --> 02:03:02.600]  I spoke with the guard about the gun debate, and being from Kansas, you know, Brownback and the state legislatures actually did a really cool thing, and they actually are trying to protect our gun rights.
[02:03:02.600 --> 02:03:07.441]  Yeah, and the crook in chief over at the Justice Department says he's going to come against the state, yes.
[02:03:08.854 --> 02:03:14.080]  Well, so I asked him, you know, I mean, here he is, he's a law enforcement officer, pretty cool guy.
[02:03:14.080 --> 02:03:17.223]  I asked him, you know, what do you think about that?
[02:03:17.956 --> 02:03:21.798]  And he basically said that he thought it was mostly grandstanding.
[02:03:21.798 --> 02:03:22.478]  You know?
[02:03:22.478 --> 02:03:26.441]  He said not so much from Brownback, but possibly from Kobach or Kobach.
[02:03:26.441 --> 02:03:28.902]  Yeah, but at least they are grandstanding.
[02:03:28.902 --> 02:03:34.405]  By saying we're going to nullify your stuff, they've nullified and let the illegal aliens run around.
[02:03:34.405 --> 02:03:35.585]  That's illegal.
[02:03:35.585 --> 02:03:41.949]  Well, this is constitutional to have the states say we're not enforcing stuff that violates the Bill of Rights.
[02:03:42.509 --> 02:03:46.880]  Let me tell you, what gives orders in this world is the will to say no.
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:47.862]  What does Tony Montana say?
[02:03:49.065 --> 02:03:54.488]  Okay, I got two things in this world, my word and my huevos, and I don't break them for no one.
[02:03:54.488 --> 02:03:56.929]  And look, it just comes down to that.
[02:03:56.929 --> 02:03:59.770]  People think groveling gets them ahead.
[02:03:59.770 --> 02:04:01.271]  That is a lie.
[02:04:01.271 --> 02:04:03.632]  And so I salute what your state's doing.
[02:04:03.632 --> 02:04:10.015]  I don't think it's just ceremonial, because the whole world is a stage and each of us players upon it.
[02:04:10.015 --> 02:04:12.456]  I mean, as Bill Hicks, I know that better than most.
[02:04:15.982 --> 02:04:22.884]  I agree, but today I actually called and I've called many times to my state representative Kevin Yoder.
[02:04:22.884 --> 02:04:28.026]  And now his, the guy who answers the phone, told me, I said, hey, what are we going to do?
[02:04:28.026 --> 02:04:32.468]  You know, obviously we're kind of leading the United States on gun rights at least.
[02:04:32.908 --> 02:04:33.428]  I don't think so.
[02:04:48.012 --> 02:04:48.813]  Come on, man.
[02:04:48.813 --> 02:04:50.394]  You know, I said, there has to be something.
[02:04:50.394 --> 02:04:54.757]  And he goes, well, you know, we'll just keep hitting them hard and da-da-da-da-da.
[02:04:54.757 --> 02:04:58.520]  And I told him, I said, you know, I'm neither Republican nor Democrat, you know.
[02:04:58.520 --> 02:04:59.041]  I hear you.
[02:04:59.041 --> 02:04:59.521]  I hear you.
[02:04:59.521 --> 02:05:00.522]  Wake more people up.
[02:05:00.522 --> 02:05:01.042]  Great job.

[02:08:19.397 --> 02:08:20.458]  All right, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:08:22.110 --> 02:08:30.733]  We'll continue the broadcast the rest of the hour, probably into overdrive, into the fourth hour today, InfoWars Nightly News, coming up seven o'clock central tonight.
[02:08:30.733 --> 02:08:49.579]  At the bottom of the hour, I will get to some of the economic and world news briefly, but Jeffrey Smith, ResponsibleTechnology.org, one of the leading researchers and voices out there, a nexus point, exposing the dangers of GMO and the war worldwide to force-feed us this garbage.
[02:08:49.579 --> 02:08:51.500]  He's going to be joining us here in just a moment.
[02:08:53.027 --> 02:08:56.411]  Obviously, you've got the spectacle of Russia to expel U.S.
[02:08:56.411 --> 02:08:58.654]  diplomat, as the Wall Street Journal calls him.
[02:08:58.654 --> 02:09:05.863]  The guy was reportedly caught with wigs and a bunch of other, you know, garbage.
[02:09:05.863 --> 02:09:10.288]  Reportedly trying to pay off a member of the Federal Security Bureau or FSB.
[02:09:11.149 --> 02:09:11.309]  I think?
[02:09:31.707 --> 02:09:42.151]  In an abortion clinic, Fox News confirms he was acquitted in the fourth baby's death, and they found guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the overdose death of an adult patient.
[02:09:42.151 --> 02:09:44.112]  That's what triggered this whole thing.
[02:09:44.112 --> 02:09:50.454]  And they go into what a grisly house of horrors it was, and how filthy it was, and that's what convinced the jury that it was really bad.
[02:09:50.454 --> 02:09:52.935]  I guess if it had been clean, it would have been okay.
[02:09:52.935 --> 02:09:54.376]  Like Dr. Mingala's lab.
[02:09:55.356 --> 02:10:11.363]  Dr. Kermit Goslin, 72, was convicted of first-degree murder and could face execution in the deaths of three babies who authorities say were delivered alive and then killed with scissors at a grimy clinic in a case that has become a flashpoint in the nation's debate over abortion.
[02:10:11.363 --> 02:10:18.206]  Regardless of what you think of abortion, folks, in the first trimester or whatever, come on, man, these are like eight- and nine-month-old babies that could be adopted.
[02:10:18.826 --> 02:10:22.068]  And then Planned Parenthood always goes, nobody wants the brown babies.
[02:10:22.068 --> 02:10:23.489]  That's like the catch-all.
[02:10:23.489 --> 02:10:28.533]  Really, there's more people wanting to adopt each year, look it up, than there are abortions.
[02:10:28.533 --> 02:10:38.099]  That's why the United States gets Korean and Chinese and African babies, and Russian babies, and now those countries are clamping down on exporting.
[02:10:38.099 --> 02:10:39.380]  People are infertile.
[02:10:39.380 --> 02:10:40.501]  They want kids.
[02:10:40.501 --> 02:10:41.481]  People love children.
[02:10:41.481 --> 02:10:42.302]  They want to raise them up.
[02:10:44.535 --> 02:10:51.756]  And they've got groups trying to keep black babies from being adopted by Hispanics or whites or vice versa, or blacks can't adopt whites.
[02:10:51.756 --> 02:10:55.597]  And it's the globalists trying to make sure those babies die.
[02:10:55.597 --> 02:10:56.877]  And pretty amazing.
[02:10:56.877 --> 02:11:02.178]  Now, one more piece of breaking news, then we're gonna go to our guest.
[02:11:02.178 --> 02:11:04.519]  This is up at InfoWars.com.
[02:11:04.519 --> 02:11:11.220]  Oops, hot mic reveals lawmakers' intent to confiscate guns.
[02:11:12.721 --> 02:11:15.208]  And this is in New Jersey.
[02:11:17.233 --> 02:11:20.675]  And I can clearly hear it with headphones on out there in the control room.
[02:11:20.675 --> 02:11:23.798]  I don't know if in radio land, if you're listening on AM or shortwave.
[02:11:23.798 --> 02:11:25.419]  On satellite, you'll probably be able to hear it.
[02:11:25.419 --> 02:11:30.762]  But you can clearly... And by tonight's news, I want to soup up the audio.
[02:11:30.762 --> 02:11:33.284]  We can put this on any other part where it's low.
[02:11:33.284 --> 02:11:34.285]  Turn it up.
[02:11:34.285 --> 02:11:35.546]  They'll say, alter the video.
[02:11:35.546 --> 02:11:36.727]  No, just turn it up.
[02:11:36.727 --> 02:11:40.609]  But this is not being augmented or souped up.
[02:11:40.609 --> 02:11:41.310]  It needs to be.
[02:11:41.310 --> 02:11:44.292]  You can hear them ending, as they classically do on C-SPAM.
[02:11:44.292 --> 02:11:45.613]  Well, this was recorded in New Jersey.
[02:11:47.188 --> 02:11:56.251]  And then, you know, the leader of the Senate and then his two adjuncts say, yeah, okay, we're going to come back and then we'll get the bill passed to confiscate their guns.
[02:11:56.251 --> 02:11:59.712]  And then you hear someone cackle.
[02:11:59.712 --> 02:12:03.513]  It's like Mike Martinez, Mayor Pro Tem at the gun grabber march.
[02:12:03.513 --> 02:12:07.594]  And he's like, we're going to first register your guns and then we're going to ban them.
[02:12:07.594 --> 02:12:08.394]  Everybody laughs.
[02:12:08.394 --> 02:12:14.616]  It's like, I mean, you know, bad guys want your guns.
[02:12:14.616 --> 02:12:16.397]  Hadn't a jack crap, Martinez.
[02:12:17.648 --> 02:12:23.532]  Okay, you're the one all, all, all, you know, mobbed up in the city government, and you know what I mean.
[02:12:23.532 --> 02:12:26.574]  And then you want my guns, punk?
[02:12:26.574 --> 02:12:28.715]  Ain't gonna happen.
[02:12:28.715 --> 02:12:31.317]  And that's what they hate is us saying it's 1776.
[02:12:31.317 --> 02:12:32.398]  We're not doing it.
[02:12:32.398 --> 02:12:34.979]  Don't cross this line.
[02:12:34.979 --> 02:12:38.362]  Do you wanna take a life?
[02:12:38.362 --> 02:12:41.744]  Do you wanna cross that line?
[02:12:41.744 --> 02:12:45.726]  Because it's a long way back from hell.
[02:12:48.430 --> 02:12:51.332]  And by taking a life, do you want to take the life of our republic?
[02:12:51.332 --> 02:12:53.333]  Do you want to kill the spirit of our country?
[02:12:53.333 --> 02:13:03.540]  Because that's what we're trying to do is kill liberty right now.
[02:13:03.540 --> 02:13:06.782]  Let's go ahead and go to the audio of this.
[02:13:09.755 --> 02:13:11.236]  We made some bills better.
[02:13:11.236 --> 02:13:16.057]  I know we couldn't make everybody happy, but we did what we could to at least improve the process.
[02:13:16.057 --> 02:13:16.798]  Thank you.
[02:13:16.798 --> 02:13:20.659]  We will see everybody back on the budget cycle next week.
[02:13:34.505 --> 02:13:37.467]  That's the line we have to go on.
[02:13:55.774 --> 02:13:58.235]  All they want to do is keep their little guns.
[02:13:58.235 --> 02:14:01.116]  Well, we're going to confiscate.
[02:14:01.116 --> 02:14:02.156]  That's right.
[02:14:02.156 --> 02:14:04.957]  We're going to get your gun yet, Mac.
[02:14:04.957 --> 02:14:09.858]  And, uh, you know, uh, by the way, uh, I got armed guards protecting me.
[02:14:09.858 --> 02:14:11.419]  And you better know I own guns.
[02:14:12.319 --> 02:14:19.403]  It's come out that Chuckie Shuma, Feinstein, Michael Moore, all of them, they got the guns!
[02:14:19.403 --> 02:14:26.346]  But you the little people, you ain't gonna need those no more, cause you know, all once we got the guns, political power grows out of the barrel.
[02:14:26.346 --> 02:14:32.229]  You know how much we like Mao Zedong, and that's what he said, we learned a lot from Chairman Mao.
[02:14:32.229 --> 02:14:33.829]  Alright.
[02:14:33.829 --> 02:14:36.651]  Oh boy, I can hear it really clear actually in my earpiece.
[02:14:37.967 --> 02:14:39.048]  And there's a transcript of it.
[02:14:39.048 --> 02:14:41.910]  It's up on Infowars.com with a nice little graphic.
[02:14:41.910 --> 02:14:43.091]  Can we punch this up?
[02:14:43.091 --> 02:14:53.078]  We took an actual Soviet poster of citizens hand over your weapons and translated it into English and added Obama's head to it.
[02:14:53.078 --> 02:14:54.019]  You gotta love it.
[02:14:54.019 --> 02:14:55.160]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:14:56.764 --> 02:15:03.766]  Let us now go to Jeffrey Smith, a best-selling author, got a lot of scientists on that he's recommended, really just a great researcher.
[02:15:03.766 --> 02:15:06.526]  He is the director of the Institute for Responsible Technology.
[02:15:06.526 --> 02:15:07.687]  That sounds extremist.
[02:15:07.687 --> 02:15:10.867]  And he's one of the world's leading advocates against GM foods.
[02:15:10.867 --> 02:15:22.470]  His book, Seeds of Deception, all of it sold at InfoWareStore.com, I would add, as an evil capitalist, is rated the number one book on the subject and has been a substantial influence on public perception and even legislation worldwide.
[02:15:22.990 --> 02:15:26.777]  Smith has reached tens of millions of people through hundreds of media interviews.
[02:15:26.777 --> 02:15:28.239]  That'll be more than that.
[02:15:28.239 --> 02:15:33.027]  He produced the video, Hidden Dangers in Kids Meals, and also writes a popular monthly Seneca column.
[02:15:33.027 --> 02:15:34.690]  He is the genetic engineering committee.
[02:15:35.749 --> 02:15:36.409]  The Sierra Club.
[02:15:36.409 --> 02:15:38.831]  I don't like a lot of what they do, but I like that part.
[02:15:38.831 --> 02:15:45.375]  He is the former Vice President of Marketing for GMO Detection Laboratory and ran for the U.S.
[02:15:45.375 --> 02:15:46.476]  Congress.
[02:15:46.476 --> 02:15:47.876]  And he's from his home state in Iowa.
[02:15:47.876 --> 02:15:48.737]  We've gone and interviewed him there.
[02:15:48.737 --> 02:15:50.358]  Beautiful corn country.
[02:15:50.358 --> 02:15:52.619]  Responsibletechnology.org is the site.
[02:15:52.619 --> 02:15:54.460]  And folks, we've got the science.
[02:15:54.460 --> 02:15:55.381]  We've got the studies.
[02:15:55.381 --> 02:15:56.982]  Rats get fed this stuff.
[02:15:56.982 --> 02:15:58.343]  They grow big, fat tumors.
[02:15:58.343 --> 02:15:59.303]  Honeybees eat it.
[02:15:59.303 --> 02:16:00.224]  They die.
[02:16:00.224 --> 02:16:02.045]  It runs from bad to worse.
[02:16:02.045 --> 02:16:03.666]  And I remember that Washington Post article last year.
[02:16:03.666 --> 02:16:04.827]  We covered a bunch where it said,
[02:16:05.727 --> 02:16:10.051]  Farmers caught not following GM regulations.
[02:16:10.051 --> 02:16:14.254]  In the article, maybe pull that up, there needs to be more enforcement on farmers.
[02:16:14.254 --> 02:16:24.121]  It said they're not planting the refuges for the bees of the non-GMO corn, so the bees are going and getting the pollen from the Bt corn that has its own pesticide and dying.
[02:16:24.121 --> 02:16:27.263]  So see, the poor bees are having to eat what we're fed!
[02:16:27.263 --> 02:16:28.564]  They're dying!
[02:16:28.564 --> 02:16:30.826]  So joining us is Debra Smith.
[02:16:30.826 --> 02:16:32.748]  There's big move, big Supreme Court ruling.
[02:16:33.568 --> 02:16:35.849]  Big defeat, of course, but they own the courts.
[02:16:35.849 --> 02:16:37.490]  Globally, a lot of victories.
[02:16:37.490 --> 02:16:39.151]  What is the latest?
[02:16:39.151 --> 02:16:42.953]  We take you now to, I guess, are you in Iowa right now, Jeffrey?
[02:16:42.953 --> 02:16:46.955]  Today I'm in California, tomorrow in Connecticut, next week in Iowa.
[02:16:46.955 --> 02:16:47.696]  All right, my friend.
[02:16:47.696 --> 02:16:49.957]  Well, your Skype looks like you're in the room with us.
[02:16:49.957 --> 02:16:54.079]  Tell us what's happening in the war, the war for being able to label.
[02:16:54.079 --> 02:16:57.441]  I mean, even if somebody thinks GMO is a great thing, hey, go eat it!
[02:16:58.381 --> 02:17:05.106]  Well, the Vermont House overwhelmingly voted in favor of labeling as a state bill.
[02:17:05.106 --> 02:17:09.709]  Now, it hasn't gone to the Senate there yet, but that was the first time in U.S.
[02:17:09.709 --> 02:17:13.792]  history that a House voted in favor of labeling.
[02:17:13.792 --> 02:17:22.118]  And last year, an explicit threat by Monsanto's attorney to the state of Vermont, saying that they would sue the state
[02:17:22.802 --> 02:17:27.707]  Cause the governor to essentially deep six the legislation at that time.
[02:17:27.707 --> 02:17:45.767]  So we're hoping that the governor finds his power and his energy and is willing to stand up to Monsanto and do what 90% of his constituents and 90% of Americans want and what 64 countries already offer and that's mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods.
[02:17:46.267 --> 02:17:52.232]  Now there's also live bills in many other states including a ballot initiative in Washington State.
[02:17:52.232 --> 02:18:02.940]  You may recall that last year a ballot initiative narrowly failed in California when the biotech industry spent more than a million dollars a day lying about the impacts of labeling.
[02:18:03.504 --> 02:18:16.850]  But we think that Washington has a better chance, whereas California, 48.6% voted in favor of labeling, we think we'll have the majority there, and we may in fact win in Connecticut, Vermont, Maine, and many other states.
[02:18:19.182 --> 02:18:22.604]  No one can argue with the right to have something labeled.
[02:18:22.604 --> 02:18:26.066]  And again, they always lie and say, we've always crossed plants.
[02:18:26.066 --> 02:18:30.948]  They're not crossing the same subspecies or families.
[02:18:30.948 --> 02:18:33.149]  They're not even involved in hybridization.
[02:18:33.149 --> 02:18:37.051]  Explain to people, we're going to break in a moment, but what's going on here?
[02:18:37.051 --> 02:18:43.555]  I mean, these are pharmacological crops, a lot of them, and rats don't end up having a very good time eating this.
[02:18:44.395 --> 02:18:55.403]  Well, they take genes from one species like bacteria, soil bacteria for example, that produces its own toxic insecticide and force it into the DNA of plants like corn.
[02:18:55.403 --> 02:19:06.771]  A study that came out this week showed that when albino mice were fed this Bt toxin, it caused damage to their red blood cells and possible advancement of leukemia.
[02:19:07.418 --> 02:19:16.921]  Other studies have shown that this BT toxin can poke holes in human cells, can end up in human blood and in the blood of unborn fetuses, and it pokes holes in the cells.
[02:19:16.921 --> 02:19:23.563]  And so when it gets in the brain, because there's no blood-brain barrier developed in the fetuses, it might be causing brain damage as well.
[02:19:23.563 --> 02:19:33.346]  So this is an example of something that they've concocted and put on the market, claiming that this BT toxin, which is known to break open the stomach of insects to kill them,
[02:19:34.987 --> 02:19:40.550]  But what's wrong with a little leukemia?
[02:19:40.550 --> 02:19:44.072]  I mean, cancer rates are up.
[02:19:44.072 --> 02:19:48.234]  I mean, we are getting rid of the excess population.
[02:19:48.234 --> 02:19:50.836]  That'll save the Earth, I mean, maybe.
[02:19:50.836 --> 02:19:53.817]  Maybe the answer is feed our children extra GMO.
[02:19:53.817 --> 02:19:57.299]  They'll be free once they're in little coffins six feet under.
[02:19:57.299 --> 02:19:58.500]  Mr. Smith, please stay with us.
[02:20:01.260 --> 02:20:03.482]  Have you ever consumed protein powder supplements?
[02:20:03.482 --> 02:20:08.785]  I have, and all of them don't taste that good, have artificial flavors, sweeteners, or unhealthy sugars.
[02:20:08.785 --> 02:20:13.108]  About a year ago, I was introduced to a new protein powder that changed my experience.
[02:20:13.108 --> 02:20:18.953]  This protein powder made me feel noticeably better, and it tasted more delicious than any drink I've ever had.
[02:20:18.953 --> 02:20:22.055]  Here's the experience of one satisfied user named Rich.
[02:20:22.055 --> 02:20:29.220]  The term best of all worlds has been belabored to death, and yet I've just discovered a whey protein powder that truly deserves to be called
[02:20:31.966 --> 02:20:32.846]  Thank you, Stephen.
[02:21:02.250 --> 02:21:08.275]  For nearly 20 years, Alex has been the voice of warning on threatening issues that the big media won't dare talk about.
[02:21:08.275 --> 02:21:10.377]  Threats that trample the American dream.
[02:21:10.377 --> 02:21:12.278]  You know what we all face.
[02:21:12.278 --> 02:21:16.121]  A crashing economy that's forcing millions out of work and from their homes.
[02:21:16.121 --> 02:21:19.164]  Half of Americans need help just to feed themselves.
[02:21:19.164 --> 02:21:22.887]  Legalized pollution of our food is sickening us with cancer and disease.
[02:21:22.887 --> 02:21:27.150]  The food you can trust in facing any of these threats comes from eFoods Direct.
[02:21:27.150 --> 02:21:29.812]  It tastes great and stores up to 25 years.

[02:22:31.461 --> 02:22:36.023]  Have you ever wondered why banks, stockbrokers, investment advisors won't talk about gold IRAs?
[02:22:36.023 --> 02:22:41.825]  They've been available since 1986, yet the financial industry won't recognize the value of gold for your retirement.
[02:22:41.825 --> 02:22:45.207]  Gold has outperformed paper investments, yet no word about IRAs.

[02:23:30.060 --> 02:23:34.322]  Bills in front of Congress right now could take away your right to keep and bear arms.
[02:23:34.322 --> 02:23:40.525]  If Obama has his way, all guns will be either banned, restricted, or confiscated, possibly by executive order.
[02:23:40.525 --> 02:23:42.886]  The best way to keep your guns is to hide them.
[02:23:42.886 --> 02:23:45.527]  What Obama can't find, Obama can't take away.
[02:23:45.527 --> 02:23:47.928]  You can protect your guns from any threat.

[02:24:06.963 --> 02:24:10.926]  By the way, major studies come out on a weekly basis.
[02:24:10.926 --> 02:24:11.926]  More than a weekly.
[02:24:11.926 --> 02:24:12.727]  Every few days.
[02:24:12.727 --> 02:24:14.188]  Big, prestigious ones.
[02:24:14.188 --> 02:24:15.489]  Smith can always go over them.
[02:24:15.489 --> 02:24:16.750]  That's why his books are so important.
[02:24:16.750 --> 02:24:18.070]  They're like textbooks.
[02:24:18.070 --> 02:24:19.091]  Everything's documented.
[02:24:19.091 --> 02:24:20.772]  Everything's very conservative.
[02:24:20.772 --> 02:24:22.173]  And he says, maybe linked.
[02:24:22.173 --> 02:24:24.455]  I mean, it's overwhelming.
[02:24:24.455 --> 02:24:32.300]  Like, Harvard's come out and admitted that they looked at 20-plus studies and, oh yeah, sodium hydrofluorosilicic acid is causing brain damage and cancer.
[02:24:32.300 --> 02:24:33.761]  Why are they putting it in the water?
[02:24:33.761 --> 02:24:36.423]  It's a toxic waste they have to pay to store, so put it in the water.
[02:24:37.243 --> 02:24:37.923]  They call it fluoride.
[02:24:37.923 --> 02:24:39.343]  It's really even worse.
[02:24:39.343 --> 02:24:42.044]  It's had some of its electrons manipulated.
[02:24:42.044 --> 02:24:46.565]  And so what Smith's getting into here is just the tip of the iceberg.
[02:24:46.565 --> 02:24:48.105]  And he is conservative about it all.
[02:24:48.105 --> 02:24:50.746]  But even being conservative, it's pretty bad.
[02:24:50.746 --> 02:24:55.046]  I saw a big study out last week where, you know, pesticides are linked to autism.
[02:24:55.046 --> 02:24:55.627]  No kidding.
[02:24:55.627 --> 02:24:59.827]  And GM, BT is linked to brain damage.
[02:24:59.827 --> 02:25:00.347]  Of course.
[02:25:00.347 --> 02:25:02.308]  I mean, it kills bugs.
[02:25:03.248 --> 02:25:05.750]  They go, well, it's naturally occurring fungus.
[02:25:05.750 --> 02:25:06.770]  What, a hundred?
[02:25:06.770 --> 02:25:07.270]  Two hundred?
[02:25:07.270 --> 02:25:08.571]  A thousand times?
[02:25:08.571 --> 02:25:10.532]  Depending on the variety, stronger?
[02:25:10.532 --> 02:25:11.793]  And then you eat it?
[02:25:11.793 --> 02:25:14.615]  I mean, bugs can't eat it, but you're supposed to.
[02:25:14.615 --> 02:25:18.297]  Jeffrey, what else is going on in the fight right now with this Supreme Court ruling?
[02:25:18.297 --> 02:25:20.298]  What are some of the new studies out there?
[02:25:20.298 --> 02:25:26.402]  It looks like we're winning the fight for hearts and minds, but Monsanto and others are in power, and so...
[02:25:28.388 --> 02:25:34.338]  If the immovable object comes up against an unstoppable force, what's going to happen?
[02:25:34.338 --> 02:25:40.929]  Well, I do think that we're winning the overall war, but not on the level of the federal government and not on the level of the courts.
[02:25:41.576 --> 02:26:02.949]  The Supreme Court yesterday just announced that Monsanto won its court case against a farmer who purchased some seeds, actually some feed from a mill, and planted it, and tried to say that the patent didn't apply because it was basically the second generation of Monsanto's soybeans.
[02:26:02.949 --> 02:26:04.350]  Well, the court didn't go for that.
[02:26:04.830 --> 02:26:12.044]  It was interesting that Clarence Thomas did not recuse himself even though he was a former Monsanto lawyer.
[02:26:12.044 --> 02:26:16.933]  This is the third time that he didn't recuse himself on a GMO decision.
[02:26:17.637 --> 02:26:21.199]  So we've lost that recent one in the Supreme Court.
[02:26:21.199 --> 02:26:39.086]  A study came out today examining five years of the diplomatic cables and there was about a thousand cables looked at over five years showing that the State Department is basically deployed as Monsanto's enforcement wing around the world trying to push biotechnology on other countries.
[02:26:39.865 --> 02:26:46.346]  We see that the USDA is basically marching lockstep with Monsanto, with one exception.
[02:26:46.346 --> 02:26:55.748]  This week they did announce, actually last Friday afternoon, they did announce that they weren't going to give a rubber stamp approval of the Agent Orange crops.
[02:26:55.748 --> 02:27:05.710]  Those are crops genetically engineered not to die when sprayed with 2,4-D, one of the components of Agent Orange, and those that are genetically engineered to resist dicamba.
[02:27:06.210 --> 02:27:17.701]  Both very, very serious toxins could cause serious health issues and they said they wanted an environmental impact statement done before they looked at the approval process.
[02:27:17.701 --> 02:27:20.083]  Not to mention all this stuff now filling the water table.
[02:27:20.965 --> 02:27:21.566]  Absolutely.
[02:27:21.566 --> 02:27:26.492]  We have now glyphosate, which is the active ingredient of Roundup.
[02:27:26.492 --> 02:27:32.320]  It was a subject of a 49-page study, and I just interviewed one of the co-authors.
[02:27:32.320 --> 02:27:37.226]  It's going to be available on our website probably tomorrow, ResponsibleTechnology.org.
[02:27:38.047 --> 02:27:53.352]  Where glyphosate and Roundup are linked to autism, obesity, diabetes, heart disease, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, virtually, as they say, every single disease related to a Western diet.
[02:27:53.352 --> 02:27:57.813]  Anorexia nervosa, anxiety, aggression.
[02:27:57.813 --> 02:28:01.494]  It turns out that Roundup, or its active ingredient glyphosate,
[02:28:02.114 --> 02:28:09.599]  It disables a couple of very important metabolic pathways, and it disables them in our gut bacteria.
[02:28:09.599 --> 02:28:15.764]  So it causes, for example, a problem in producing tryptophan, which is the precursor to serotonin.
[02:28:15.764 --> 02:28:19.266]  Serotonin will tell the body, you're full now, stop eating.
[02:28:19.266 --> 02:28:21.808]  So if there's not enough serotonin, you may just keep eating.
[02:28:22.168 --> 02:28:23.590]  Let me just stop you for a minute here.
[02:28:23.590 --> 02:28:24.911]  Think about this, folks.
[02:28:40.629 --> 02:28:43.271]  We've got the highest level of diabetes in the world.
[02:28:43.271 --> 02:28:44.932]  Highest level of cancer.
[02:28:44.932 --> 02:28:47.093]  Most obese.
[02:28:47.093 --> 02:28:48.394]  IQs are lowering.
[02:28:48.394 --> 02:28:50.656]  I mean, that's not just education.
[02:28:50.656 --> 02:28:51.997]  We're being poisoned.
[02:28:51.997 --> 02:28:54.958]  I mean, it's a cocktail of things.
[02:28:54.958 --> 02:28:57.020]  And the power structure knows this.
[02:28:57.020 --> 02:28:59.121]  I mean, what do you think they're up to?
[02:28:59.121 --> 02:28:59.802]  They just don't care?
[02:29:00.683 --> 02:29:03.807]  Well, they continue to ignore the research.
[02:29:03.807 --> 02:29:15.242]  I remember talking to a FDA official who was very high up in GMO evaluations, and I told her two different studies that we were aware of and have been talking about for years.
[02:29:15.903 --> 02:29:22.867]  One that showed that genes can transfer into the DNA of gut bacteria and potentially continue to function.
[02:29:22.867 --> 02:29:30.071]  Which means long after we stop eating GMOs, we may be producing this toxic insecticide or the Roundup Ready gene.
[02:29:30.071 --> 02:29:33.753]  And that also, that genes may be unstable.
[02:29:33.753 --> 02:29:41.137]  Because there was evidence showing that the genetic sequence of the same event, but analyzed in two different laboratories, were different.
[02:29:41.137 --> 02:29:43.799]  Which means it might produce something completely unexpected.
[02:29:44.119 --> 02:29:46.121]  Mutations, stay there, we gotta come right back.
[02:29:46.121 --> 02:29:50.205]  Long segment coming up with the GMO expert.
[02:29:50.205 --> 02:29:54.129]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[02:29:54.129 --> 02:29:56.812]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:30:01.536 --> 02:30:04.938]  You prepare by purchasing gold, food and firearms.

[02:31:02.233 --> 02:31:08.357]  For nearly 20 years, Alex has been the voice of warning on threatening issues that the big media won't dare talk about.
[02:31:08.357 --> 02:31:10.479]  Threats that trample the American dream.
[02:31:10.479 --> 02:31:12.380]  You know what we all face.
[02:31:12.380 --> 02:31:16.302]  A crashing economy that's forcing millions out of work and from their homes.
[02:31:16.302 --> 02:31:19.384]  Half of Americans need help just to feed themselves.
[02:31:19.384 --> 02:31:23.167]  Legalized pollution of our food is sickening us with cancer and disease.
[02:31:23.167 --> 02:31:27.470]  The food you can trust in facing any of these threats comes from eFoods Direct.
[02:31:27.470 --> 02:31:31.533]  It tastes great and stores up to 25 years, ready for when you need it most.
[02:31:32.193 --> 02:31:32.613]  I think so.
[02:32:01.815 --> 02:32:07.662]  Now that we have moved into the winter season, there is an increased need to support our immunity and health.
[02:32:08.556 --> 02:32:15.319]  At Silver Lungs, we are committed to meeting your needs by providing a full selection of silver-based products.

[02:32:26.265 --> 02:32:30.407]  Just released is our 100% natural silver gel.
[02:32:30.407 --> 02:32:36.590]  Our new silver gel is not based on synthetic gelling agents, which quickly evaporate and leave the silver at the surface.
[02:32:37.330 --> 02:32:37.990]  We're good to go!
[02:33:08.365 --> 02:33:23.471]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the resistance, rallying patriots worldwide.
[02:33:23.471 --> 02:33:31.594]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:33:31.594 --> 02:33:33.315]  Every time I go to a restaurant,
[02:33:34.668 --> 02:33:47.416]  Every time I sit there and I look at my darling little children, and I realize that I'm on the road, and I'm being lazy, and I just go into some place and just feed them, even if it's a healthy food, I know it's got GMO in it.
[02:33:47.416 --> 02:33:49.357]  I know it's got hormones.
[02:33:49.357 --> 02:33:57.202]  It is hard to try to keep my children off GMO, but they're probably off of it 90% of the time.
[02:33:57.202 --> 02:34:04.006]  And they know as mammals that if they just put something out in the environment, we will just take it and accept it, and we'll muddle through it.
[02:34:05.148 --> 02:34:11.493]  They'll use our capacity to adapt and improvise in hard situations to put up with this.
[02:34:11.493 --> 02:34:21.901]  I was once on a first-class airplane flight, going up to be on the view, and there was the president of a major bank.
[02:34:21.901 --> 02:34:25.403]  I'll just leave it at that, because he figured out who I was at the end.
[02:34:25.403 --> 02:34:26.825]  I got pretty upset that he'd been talking to me.
[02:34:30.031 --> 02:34:33.453]  He just said, it doesn't matter what you do, they'll put up with anything.
[02:34:33.453 --> 02:34:36.155]  It's their adaptiveness.
[02:34:36.155 --> 02:34:43.279]  And the fact that we know they're adaptive, talking about us like we're not even human, and I already knew this, but having this guy, you know, tell me this.
[02:34:43.279 --> 02:34:47.942]  I've seen on TV, you know his name.
[02:34:47.942 --> 02:34:55.947]  To have him sit there, he was flying down here to see his retired general father who lives in San Antonio.
[02:34:55.947 --> 02:34:59.669]  I sat there for three hours on the New York flight while this guy, and we talked.
[02:35:01.261 --> 02:35:03.082]  And, uh, off and on.
[02:35:03.082 --> 02:35:15.331]  You know, he had the perfect gray hair, the perfect black trench coat, uh, cashmere, you know, when he got up and put it on, you know, his suit, you know, even on a flight looked perfect.
[02:35:15.331 --> 02:35:17.833]  And he was like a James Bond type guy.
[02:35:17.833 --> 02:35:21.756]  And I told him, I said, doesn't matter how slick you are, you're going to be defeated in the end.
[02:35:21.756 --> 02:35:28.901]  He just, he was just like, but what he said repeatedly is the people will, will muddle through anything.
[02:35:30.532 --> 02:35:31.572]  And they use that.
[02:35:31.572 --> 02:35:38.195]  They use our own adaptiveness and the fact that we'll put up with so much to not notice the ambient background of all this that's being turned up.
[02:35:38.195 --> 02:35:40.676]  And they know full well what they're doing.
[02:35:40.676 --> 02:35:48.019]  It's come out that Monsanto, 15 years ago it came out in the news, and then again 10 years ago, and then again last year, at their own facilities, doesn't eat their own GMO.
[02:35:49.355 --> 02:35:51.916]  ...and demands organic.
[02:35:51.916 --> 02:35:54.737]  The communist Chinese elite demand their own secret farms.
[02:35:54.737 --> 02:35:56.998]  That's come out and it's been a big scandal.
[02:35:56.998 --> 02:35:58.679]  It's the same thing in Europe.
[02:35:58.679 --> 02:36:02.600]  The quote, clean vaccines the German government and British government got.
[02:36:02.600 --> 02:36:05.522]  See, I'm not even so much against vaccine technology, folks.
[02:36:05.522 --> 02:36:07.602]  I know you can get some immunity from that.
[02:36:07.602 --> 02:36:15.165]  It's that you can't trust these companies who have these histories of testing and all this and all the autism and all this.
[02:36:15.165 --> 02:36:16.526]  My point is, is that
[02:36:18.550 --> 02:36:20.371]  We have to get conscious of what's happening.
[02:36:20.371 --> 02:36:25.632]  It's like if you put a slow kill poison in a pond to kill feral hogs.
[02:36:25.632 --> 02:36:28.493]  It's illegal, but people do it because they're out of control in Texas.
[02:36:28.493 --> 02:36:30.533]  Invasive species.
[02:36:30.533 --> 02:36:37.496]  And because they've already eaten all the baby deer, run off the deer, taken the deer's forage, there's no deer they're going to get poisoned, maybe some coyotes.
[02:36:37.496 --> 02:36:43.617]  You poison that pond and the deer will come and they will, and the pigs will come and they will drink from it.
[02:36:43.617 --> 02:36:45.838]  And they don't know why everybody starts dying a week later.
[02:36:47.199 --> 02:36:48.420]  And it's the same thing.
[02:36:48.420 --> 02:36:53.904]  This is ambient, it builds up, and this is what they talk about in eco-science by the White House.
[02:36:53.904 --> 02:36:55.965]  Science czar is putting stuff in our food and water.
[02:36:55.965 --> 02:36:57.866]  The UN's been caught doing it.
[02:36:57.866 --> 02:36:59.747]  Now, I get into why they're doing it.
[02:36:59.747 --> 02:37:04.470]  A lot of its companies don't care, so the globalists just let other companies that just don't care do whatever they want.
[02:37:04.470 --> 02:37:15.718]  I mean, it's a lot of neglect, not caring, Bayer with the Factor VIII, millions of ampules filled with HIV and hepatitis, knowing it was a death sentence for a decade, selling it out in the public.
[02:37:16.078 --> 02:37:28.807]  And then when it came out in court in Australia and France, the executives are like, well, they're hemophiliacs anyways, they're a drain on society, let them die.
[02:37:28.807 --> 02:37:30.328]  Those are a lot of people people love.
[02:37:30.328 --> 02:37:33.810]  These people have lives and we're treating their hemophilia and living a good life.
[02:37:33.810 --> 02:37:35.091]  And you killed them.
[02:37:35.091 --> 02:37:38.114]  And then you're like, let them, you know what I say, you're not human.
[02:37:38.114 --> 02:37:42.657]  How about, how would you like being lined up and shot up full of hepatitis, you punks?
[02:37:44.431 --> 02:37:46.492]  How would you like that?
[02:37:46.492 --> 02:37:48.133]  Stop treating us like we're animals!
[02:37:48.133 --> 02:37:52.415]  Excuse me, I'm going back to our guest, Jeffrey Smith.
[02:37:52.415 --> 02:37:59.819]  Folks, I have empathy because my instincts are aligned with life, not because I'm some wimp.
[02:37:59.819 --> 02:38:05.462]  Real men have empathy, ladies and gentlemen, because what happens to other people is going to happen to us, and I have to go through hell
[02:38:06.960 --> 02:38:12.763]  I have to go through hell to try to keep my kids off this stuff, then I see other people's kids who look like they're death.
[02:38:12.763 --> 02:38:23.909]  You go look how unhealthy people are, how dumb people are, and all the weird diseases and isms and things that are happening, and it's all linked to the chemical diet, the bio crap, all of it.
[02:38:23.909 --> 02:38:34.074]  I'm sorry Jeffrey, I'm ranting, this stuff gets to me, because I know I'm right, I know you're right, I know the history, and it just doesn't stop, and the arrogance of these people, and there's no way
[02:38:35.216 --> 02:38:39.259]  These elitists that are doing this, even though they try to avoid it, there's no way they can avoid it.
[02:38:39.259 --> 02:38:44.043]  Isn't the proof of them trying to avoid it, through the entire power structure, proof that they know?
[02:38:45.171 --> 02:38:54.361]  Well, I talked to a former Monsanto scientist and he said three of his colleagues were testing the milk from cows treated with Monsanto's bovine growth hormone.
[02:38:54.361 --> 02:39:04.072]  And they found so much cancer-promoting IGF-1 hormone in the milk that the three Monsanto scientists refused to drink milk thereafter unless it was organic.
[02:39:04.072 --> 02:39:04.993]  One bought his own cow.
[02:39:05.629 --> 02:39:25.464]  Now, it was clear, obvious, that these three Monsanto scientists believed that the milk might be creating cancer, refused to feed it to their families, and yet they somehow felt either okay or at least powerless to stop the company that they worked for from marketing it to the rest of the public.
[02:39:25.464 --> 02:39:27.745]  Now, you talked about your kids and bringing them out to eat.
[02:39:27.745 --> 02:39:30.948]  I want to share a story that happened three weeks ago at MIT.
[02:39:31.883 --> 02:39:46.596]  I was giving a talk at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology along with Stephanie, Dr. Stephanie Seneff, who I interview, and her interview is going to come out tomorrow at ResponsibleTechnology.org, a fascinating interview about the dangers of glyphosate.
[02:39:46.596 --> 02:39:47.857]  We're roundup.
[02:39:47.857 --> 02:39:54.783]  And I asked the audience, as I typically do these days, how many of you have avoided GMOs and noticed a change in your health?
[02:39:55.367 --> 02:40:01.231]  And a woman shot up her head and said, I saw your film recently, Genetic Roulette, The Gamble of Our Lives.
[02:40:01.231 --> 02:40:02.853]  Now you have that on your site.
[02:40:02.853 --> 02:40:06.636]  It's the most powerful game changing video.
[02:40:06.636 --> 02:40:09.037]  It changes people's diet on the spot.
[02:40:09.037 --> 02:40:12.700]  She saw the film and a light bulb went off.
[02:40:12.700 --> 02:40:17.163]  Her six and a half year old boy was desperately aggressive, out of control.
[02:40:17.163 --> 02:40:18.945]  They tried to call him retarded.
[02:40:18.945 --> 02:40:20.386]  They wanted to take him out of school.
[02:40:21.053 --> 02:40:26.075]  She saw other parents in the video describing the improvements of their autistic kids.
[02:40:26.075 --> 02:40:33.077]  They saw farmers talking about the improvements in their animals, doctors talking about the improvements in their patients.
[02:40:33.077 --> 02:40:40.300]  So she immediately took her child off of all genetically modified foods and said she has a new child now.
[02:40:40.300 --> 02:40:44.521]  He's no longer aggressive, no longer being threatened with the term retarded.
[02:40:44.521 --> 02:40:46.322]  No one wants to take him out of school.
[02:40:46.322 --> 02:40:50.263]  He's completely calm and well organized in his brain.
[02:40:50.831 --> 02:40:53.333]  Now this is one of numerous stories.
[02:40:53.333 --> 02:41:08.903]  I've heard thousands of stories of people talking about allergies and asthma and brain fog and lethargy and skin problems and kidney disease, infertility, gastrointestinal disorders, a whole host of problems getting better
[02:41:09.543 --> 02:41:11.284]  When they stop eating GMOs.
[02:41:11.284 --> 02:41:16.166]  And I've been to the doctor's offices with cameras interviewing the doctors and the patients.
[02:41:16.166 --> 02:41:22.729]  Some patients say they got rid of Crohn's disease in three days or irritable bowel in six weeks or incredible.
[02:41:22.729 --> 02:41:30.352]  And when you look at them, when you look at the individuals removing GMOs from their diet, they may have to buy organic or reduce processed foods.
[02:41:30.352 --> 02:41:31.832]  So there's potential cofactors.
[02:41:31.832 --> 02:41:34.113]  And I understand you know what I mean by cofactors.
[02:41:34.113 --> 02:41:36.454]  Maybe it's the additives that are being taken out.
[02:41:36.454 --> 02:41:37.775]  But when the livestock
[02:41:38.297 --> 02:41:38.837]  I've talked
[02:41:57.603 --> 02:42:13.801]  So many farmers, more than a decade ago, a lot of family that are farmers, I live around farmers, they say, look, we go on GMO, we start having most our calves born dead, the baby pigs die, everything starts dying, because it has pesticides in it, it has all sorts of other things engineered into it.
[02:42:13.801 --> 02:42:15.763]  I want you to get into some of the science here.
[02:42:17.365 --> 02:42:23.352]  Again, this is something that the power structure that you just mentioned knows and is aware of.
[02:42:23.352 --> 02:42:34.023]  So my question to you is, what do you expect to happen with this as the diabetes, the cancer, everything goes up, as more and more studies come out linking it to this?
[02:42:35.304 --> 02:42:38.706]  I mean, will we have Nuremberg trials for these GMO companies?
[02:42:38.706 --> 02:42:49.533]  Well, I'm actually doing some deep research into linking GMOs with autism, with allergies, with asthma, with gluten sensitivity, infertility, and gut problems.
[02:42:49.533 --> 02:42:54.916]  And I'm working with some of the top professionals and practitioners in these areas to show the link.
[02:42:55.436 --> 02:43:09.373]  Now, what's happening, however, is good news, Alex, and that is that as people watch the movie Genetic Roulette, or they go to our website, non-gmo-shopping-guide.com, or download our free app, ShopNoGMO, and learn to avoid GMOs,
[02:43:10.149 --> 02:43:14.212]  Then it's applying economic pressure to the food companies.
[02:43:14.212 --> 02:43:23.659]  So last year in 2012, products that were labeled non-GMO grew in sales by 26%, outpacing all other categories.
[02:43:23.659 --> 02:43:33.666]  In fact, when Whole Foods announced it was going to require labeling in five years, they told USA Today that when a product becomes third-party verified as non-GMO, sales increase 15 to 30%.
[02:43:35.587 --> 02:43:38.469]  No, we know that the rest of the food companies are listening.
[02:43:38.469 --> 02:43:42.752]  So is free market voting with our dollars is the only main weapon we've got?
[02:43:42.752 --> 02:43:53.040]  It's the main weapon we've got, plus the possibility of passing some of these labeling laws in states, which again allows for voting with our dollars by choosing the non-GMO.
[02:43:53.040 --> 02:43:55.321]  So yes, we have the power here.
[02:43:55.321 --> 02:43:59.945]  We don't want to give up the power and say the FDA will bail us out or the USDA will bail us out.
[02:44:00.305 --> 02:44:02.066]  And you know that as well as I do.
[02:44:02.066 --> 02:44:06.708]  In the case of GMOs, the biotech industry has been calling the shots.
[02:44:06.708 --> 02:44:17.012]  It was Monsanto's former attorney at the FDA who was in charge of GMO policy, ignored the warnings of the scientists working at the agency, and said no testing was necessary.
[02:44:17.012 --> 02:44:18.332]  They own the Supreme Court, everything.
[02:44:18.332 --> 02:44:19.153]  It's a total joke.
[02:44:20.093 --> 02:44:34.061]  But what they don't own is the ability for you and I to get the information out to those who are health conscious, to parents who want to protect their kids, to those who are sick, to health care professionals, to religious people that think GMO means God move over.
[02:44:34.061 --> 02:44:40.284]  We're targeting these receptive peoples, receptive low-hanging non-GMO fruit as I call them.
[02:44:40.284 --> 02:44:46.768]  So when we start to get about 5% of US shoppers avoiding GM ingredients, that should be a tipping point.
[02:44:47.188 --> 02:44:47.368]  Thank you.
[02:45:03.175 --> 02:45:09.617]  When we have doctors speak about GMOs, they speak with far more conviction about the problems than I do.
[02:45:09.617 --> 02:45:12.777]  Because they get to experiment on their patients.
[02:45:12.777 --> 02:45:16.618]  They get to tell their patients, remove GMOs, let's see what happens.
[02:45:16.618 --> 02:45:18.839]  And they do it 10 times, 100 times.
[02:45:18.839 --> 02:45:22.880]  One woman did it 5,000 times and she said, it never doesn't work.
[02:45:23.420 --> 02:45:32.270]  Everyone gets better, which leads us to believe that GMOs are a major contributor to these wide variety of diseases that are on the rise in the U.S.
[02:45:32.270 --> 02:45:41.199]  population since GMOs were introduced, and the same diseases and disorders on the rise are those that individuals are reporting go away when they eliminate GMOs.
[02:45:41.599 --> 02:45:44.601]  Wow, and they know the fluoride is deadly in our water.
[02:45:44.601 --> 02:45:50.084]  They know the aspartame is making people go blind and have early onset of neurological disorders.
[02:45:50.084 --> 02:45:52.425]  They know the GMO is just devastating.
[02:45:52.425 --> 02:45:56.407]  I mean, the studies that are in your books and videos, let's put them up on screen for TV viewers.
[02:45:56.807 --> 02:46:02.392]  Folks, you can support the work of Mr. Smith and Infowars, but more importantly, wake your friends and family up.
[02:46:02.392 --> 02:46:11.821]  If you can organize a showing in your neighborhood of Genetic Roulette, the film, and have the book there that's like a textbook that shows all the documents, that will save lives.
[02:46:11.821 --> 02:46:12.101]  And look,
[02:46:12.902 --> 02:46:16.645]  The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step.
[02:46:16.645 --> 02:46:18.686]  I mean, look at McDonald's.
[02:46:18.686 --> 02:46:23.889]  When I first heard, like, seven years ago on the news report that they had silicone in their McNuggets, I didn't believe it.
[02:46:23.889 --> 02:46:27.532]  And then I went and looked it up and they have loopholes called an additive and a bunch of other chains do it.
[02:46:27.532 --> 02:46:28.533]  I mean, it's not just GMO.
[02:46:28.533 --> 02:46:30.174]  It's like plastic in the food.
[02:46:30.174 --> 02:46:32.715]  I mean, no wonder there's kidney failure all over the place.
[02:46:32.715 --> 02:46:35.737]  It is so insane what they've gotten away with.
[02:46:35.737 --> 02:46:42.302]  So go to Infowarsstore.com, get Genetic Roulette DVD book special, get a discount, get both of them together.
[02:46:43.042 --> 02:46:48.305]  Uh, you know, that's why they don't want, under No Child Left Behind, teachers being able to teach where they just hand out packets now.
[02:46:48.305 --> 02:46:50.607]  They don't want a teacher sneaking in and showing this.
[02:46:50.607 --> 02:46:51.127]  Well, you know what?
[02:46:51.127 --> 02:46:52.448]  Break the rules!
[02:46:52.448 --> 02:46:57.351]  Go to your principal and say, I need to teach him how to love to learn, you know, not how to be robots.
[02:46:57.351 --> 02:46:58.672]  We've got your churches.
[02:46:59.850 --> 02:47:11.097]  Should be showing a genetic roulette and also the World According to Monsanto, Seeds of Deception, the Case Against Fluoride, all of it available at infowarestore.com.
[02:47:11.097 --> 02:47:21.383]  Now I've got to say this, we've got all the studies, the science, I want to get into that, other areas, because I don't want to just ask the questions, you're the expert here, but I research this every day so I can verify what you're saying and then a lot more.
[02:47:21.383 --> 02:47:26.427]  I know you're holding back because you're a big target here of these people, but you can see the worm turning.
[02:47:26.427 --> 02:47:26.747]  It's like
[02:47:27.856 --> 02:47:30.938]  Almost like Monsanto was like, you know, Scientologists.
[02:47:30.938 --> 02:47:33.180]  People were scared to talk about them and suddenly they're not.
[02:47:33.180 --> 02:47:35.382]  And people were scared to talk about Obama, now they're not.
[02:47:35.382 --> 02:47:38.244]  It's kind of like the dam breaking.
[02:47:38.244 --> 02:47:48.091]  But I know so many engineers, scientists, oil company people that I've run into, family, people I know, doctors.
[02:47:48.091 --> 02:47:51.774]  One guy puts in silicon factories.
[02:47:51.774 --> 02:47:54.696]  And I've talked to him and he'll say, man, you know what wakes me up about GMO?
[02:47:56.747 --> 02:48:03.013]  I probably talk no exaggeration more than 20 people told me this over the years, just anecdotally, separately.
[02:48:03.013 --> 02:48:18.408]  They go, you know, I went to Ukraine to help build an oil refinery, or I went to Czech Republic to do this, that was in two cases, or I went to Japan to put this in, and they go, I lost 40 pounds in three months.
[02:48:19.449 --> 02:48:20.530]  I drank like a fish.
[02:48:20.530 --> 02:48:21.951]  I ate like a pig.
[02:48:21.951 --> 02:48:23.652]  Those people stay up all night partying.
[02:48:23.652 --> 02:48:24.953]  Same thing about the Czech Republic.
[02:48:24.953 --> 02:48:26.695]  But they're all skinny and healthy.
[02:48:26.695 --> 02:48:29.477]  They live longer than us smoking cigarettes.
[02:48:29.477 --> 02:48:30.498]  What is the French?
[02:48:30.498 --> 02:48:32.299]  I talked to one guy who was doing something.
[02:48:32.299 --> 02:48:33.420]  He goes, man, they smoke cigarettes.
[02:48:33.420 --> 02:48:34.801]  They get drunk every night.
[02:48:34.801 --> 02:48:35.802]  They party constantly.
[02:48:35.802 --> 02:48:37.123]  They sleep four hours a night.
[02:48:37.123 --> 02:48:38.744]  They look great.
[02:48:38.744 --> 02:48:43.928]  Everybody I talk to, men, women, they go to Europe and places that don't have GMO and they get healthy.
[02:48:43.928 --> 02:48:44.589]  What's going on?
[02:48:45.229 --> 02:48:49.210]  We've heard that same thing for many years, and sometimes it's even more specific, Alex.
[02:48:49.210 --> 02:48:55.753]  Sometimes people say, I can't have soy in the U.S., but when I have soy in Europe, it doesn't cause a reaction.
[02:48:55.753 --> 02:48:56.933]  Same with corn.
[02:48:56.933 --> 02:49:05.116]  That's because the tipping point of consumer rejection did kick GMOs out of direct derivatives in Europe, in the 27 countries there.
[02:49:05.116 --> 02:49:12.098]  They do have animal feed that's genetically engineered, but they don't have soy, lecithin, or high fructose corn syrup, etc., that we have here.
[02:49:12.658 --> 02:49:22.908]  Likewise, when people say that they can eat the organic varieties but not the GM varieties, this gives us an indication that it is, in fact, the GMO that's causing the problem.
[02:49:22.908 --> 02:49:30.916]  Now, the study that came out, you mentioned earlier, in September of last year, this was trying to define what's causing the problem.
[02:49:30.916 --> 02:49:36.381]  Is it the genetic engineering or is it the roundup that gets poured onto these roundup ready crops?
[02:49:36.881 --> 02:49:51.950]  So they took rats that were eating either genetically engineered corn that was Roundup ready, so it was sprayed with Roundup, or they were just eating Roundup in their water supply, or they were just eating the corn that wasn't treated with Roundup.
[02:49:52.410 --> 02:49:58.955]  But in all three cases, Alex, the animals got early death, organ damage, and massive multiple tumors.
[02:49:58.955 --> 02:50:04.540]  Up to 80% of the female rats had tumors mostly in the mammary glands.
[02:50:04.540 --> 02:50:18.070]  So in this case, we think it's both the Roundup herbicide that's sprayed on the crops, as well as the massive collateral damage that occurs in the DNA as a result of the process of genetic engineering.
[02:50:18.070 --> 02:50:19.191]  So it's a double whammy.
[02:50:19.651 --> 02:50:23.295]  Then you have this sweet corn that they're selling in Walmart.
[02:50:23.295 --> 02:50:24.917]  It's Monsanto sweet corn.
[02:50:24.917 --> 02:50:33.807]  It's not only Roundup ready, but it also produces the BT toxin that we know breaks little holes in human cells, causing leakage.
[02:50:33.807 --> 02:50:38.733]  If it causes leaky gut, many scientists link that with autoimmune disease.
[02:50:39.553 --> 02:50:44.135]  With allergies, asthma, cancer, Parkinson's, Alzheimer's.
[02:50:44.135 --> 02:50:46.675]  And that's why it affects behavior.
[02:50:46.675 --> 02:50:48.376]  You drink, it affects your brain.
[02:50:48.376 --> 02:50:53.197]  Well, you eat a bunch of pesticide garbage, you're going to get irritable, you're going to get aggressive.
[02:50:53.197 --> 02:50:55.818]  We'll be right back with our amazing guest, Jeffrey Smith.
[02:50:55.818 --> 02:50:59.119]  Get the books and videos at Infowarsstore.com.
[02:50:59.119 --> 02:51:00.580]  Battle them with your dollars.

[02:51:09.013 --> 02:51:19.136]  EM-1 is an organic soil conditioner, fertilizer amendment, and compost accelerant that provides a broad spectrum of beneficial microorganisms, enzymes, trace minerals, vitamins, and various organic acids.
[02:51:19.136 --> 02:51:24.197]  EM-1 helps regulate the soil's pH level and its soil microbes, improving moisture retention and drought tolerance.
[02:51:24.457 --> 02:51:26.418]  Remember last year's dry conditions?
[02:51:26.418 --> 02:51:31.299]  EM-1 from Terragonics is safe, chemical free, and certified for use on all organic farms.
[02:51:31.299 --> 02:51:38.602]  It improves plant quality, size, color, flavor, and gives up to 20% more nutrient value in fruits and vegetables, and greatly increases shelf life.
[02:51:38.602 --> 02:51:41.543]  And EM-1 is so simple to use, just mix with water and apply.

[02:52:01.715 --> 02:52:08.278]  When you're out on the road, the last place you want to be is on the road.
[02:52:08.278 --> 02:52:13.421]  But if the unfortunate happens, you'll be glad you were wearing diamond gussets.
[02:52:13.421 --> 02:52:22.145]  There's a place down in Tennessee where they make blue diamond gusset jeans.
[02:52:22.145 --> 02:52:26.227]  They sew pride in every stitch.
[02:52:26.227 --> 02:52:28.348]  Guarantee you'll love the way they fit.
[02:52:30.520 --> 02:52:35.244]  They put a diamond gusset in the crotch, where you need it most.
[02:52:35.244 --> 02:52:39.086]  Blue diamond gussets, got it.
[02:52:39.086 --> 02:52:40.307]  Others don't.
[02:52:40.307 --> 02:52:42.449]  We turn jeans inside out.
[02:52:42.449 --> 02:52:44.250]  Diamond gusset jeans.
[02:52:44.250 --> 02:52:47.132]  Made in the USA with unparalleled quality.

[02:52:56.459 --> 02:52:58.841]  Diamond gusset jeans, got it.
[02:52:58.841 --> 02:52:59.702]  Others don't.
[02:53:00.953 --> 02:53:05.715]  Hello, this is Ty Bollinger, author of the best-selling book, Cancer Step Outside the Box.
[02:53:05.715 --> 02:53:08.737]  I want you to know some very important information.
[02:53:08.737 --> 02:53:17.721]  In 1985, President Ronald Reagan requested that carnivora be sent directly to the White House at a time when only the President could obtain this world-class healer.
[02:53:17.721 --> 02:53:22.624]  Now, 27 years later, carnivora capsules are used around the world to keep people healthy.
[02:53:23.257 --> 02:53:34.629]  Now you can protect yourself and your loved ones in this age of superbugs with 17 naturally occurring compounds that instinctively respond to abnormal cells only without harming a single normal cell.
[02:53:34.629 --> 02:53:41.636]  If you want to stay healthy, now's your chance to literally wake up your critical immune cells to attack harmful invaders that don't belong in your body.
[02:53:42.316 --> 02:53:46.618]  Call 1-866-VENUSFLY or order from carnivora.com.
[02:53:46.618 --> 02:53:50.219]  That's C-A-R-N-I-V-O-R-A dot com.
[02:53:50.219 --> 02:53:57.482]  That's 1-866-836-8735, 1-866-VENUSFLY or visit carnivora.com.
[02:53:57.482 --> 02:53:58.742]  Protect your immune system.
[02:53:58.742 --> 02:53:59.783]  It's the only one you've got.
[02:54:17.984 --> 02:54:30.574]  Yeah, folks, the film Genetic Roulette was 2012 Movie of the Year, Solari Report, Transformational Film of the Year, Aware Guide, and again, it's available at infowarestore.com.
[02:54:30.574 --> 02:54:39.661]  And yeah, you support us getting the word out, you support what he's doing, what we're doing, but I mean, really, it's about waking up, because you need to take this personal.
[02:54:39.661 --> 02:54:43.563]  Myself included, every time I do one of these interviews, I think, you know all this,
[02:54:44.639 --> 02:54:48.180]  But you still go in a restaurant and don't even ask, is this organic?
[02:54:48.180 --> 02:54:52.422]  And by demanding that, it will then create the market and then it will displace it.
[02:54:52.422 --> 02:54:56.684]  Just like you can't even find non-GMO milk now, or hormone milk.
[02:54:56.684 --> 02:55:03.226]  It's all organic everywhere I go around the country, unless it's a low-income area at a gas station.
[02:55:03.226 --> 02:55:05.467]  And that's really the exciting thing.
[02:55:05.467 --> 02:55:10.069]  We demand quality, we demand service, we demand transparency.
[02:55:10.069 --> 02:55:13.791]  It doesn't matter how many lawyers in government Monsanto has.
[02:55:14.707 --> 02:55:17.593]  It doesn't matter how many people they own.
[02:55:17.593 --> 02:55:19.617]  And this is just basic cell preservation.
[02:55:19.617 --> 02:55:20.639]  And by the way, I've researched it.
[02:55:20.639 --> 02:55:22.703]  These are eugenicists, folks.
[02:55:22.703 --> 02:55:24.287]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[02:55:24.287 --> 02:55:25.569]  It's not just Monsanto.
[02:55:26.994 --> 02:55:31.736]  And I look at the rat photos, type in GMO rat photos if you dare, and look at the studies.
[02:55:31.736 --> 02:55:50.282]  And I've had top scientists on countless times, you've heard them, that were like making millions a year as GMO scientists, had patents, were working with these really big companies, and then found out it was sterilizing lab animals and things, and so they would just refuse to be part of it anymore, and then be demonized and attacked, but they've been vindicated.
[02:55:50.282 --> 02:55:54.263]  Well, what's the point spending all this money if your grandkids, you know, get cancer?
[02:55:55.334 --> 02:56:05.457]  And by the way, Jeffrey Smith, you haven't even gotten into what happens by the second and third generation in guinea pigs and rats when they're fed different GMO diets.
[02:56:05.457 --> 02:56:12.640]  Tell people about that briefly and what the studies show the worst linked GMO things are.
[02:56:12.640 --> 02:56:15.541]  I mean, is it the pesticide based BT things?
[02:56:16.465 --> 02:56:27.896]  Well, as far as the multiple generations go, there was a study, not yet published, but we did announce the results when the Moscow scientists did report them.
[02:56:27.896 --> 02:56:36.043]  And that is when they fed hamsters genetically modified soybeans, by the third generation, most were sterile.
[02:56:36.043 --> 02:56:42.129]  They also died at four or five times the rate compared to controls that were eating the non-GM soybeans.
[02:56:42.874 --> 02:56:46.557]  And many of the hamsters had hair growing in their mouths.
[02:56:46.557 --> 02:56:50.661]  Now, hair growing in the mouths is not something that's common at all.
[02:56:50.661 --> 02:56:55.725]  It's extremely rare, but they had never... Well, his Skype broke up.
[02:56:55.725 --> 02:56:59.548]  As they had with the GMO fed groups.
[02:56:59.548 --> 02:57:02.010]  Sorry, your Skype broke up for a moment.
[02:57:02.010 --> 02:57:04.232]  Why are you discriminating against people with hair in their mouths?
[02:57:04.232 --> 02:57:06.034]  I mean, maybe that's a gift the government's going to give us.
[02:57:07.105 --> 02:57:07.906]  Well, it's true.
[02:57:07.906 --> 02:57:09.627]  You know, you never know.
[02:57:09.627 --> 02:57:15.213]  One thing, though, about this time, I'm thinking some of your listeners may want to know how to avoid GMOs.
[02:57:15.213 --> 02:57:16.974]  Shall we give them a little primer on that?
[02:57:16.974 --> 02:57:18.395]  Yes.
[02:57:18.395 --> 02:57:21.799]  Okay, there are nine genetically modified food crops.
[02:57:21.799 --> 02:57:30.707]  They are soy, corn, cottonseed oil, canola oil, sugar from sugar beets, alfalfa, which is used as hay for animals,
[02:57:31.391 --> 02:57:39.174]  There's zucchini and yellow crookneck squash, not all of it, but some of it, as well as papaya from either Hawaii or China.
[02:57:39.174 --> 02:57:46.696]  Now all of these are found at non-gmo-shopping-guide.com or in the free download iPhone application ShopNoGMO.
[02:57:47.316 --> 02:57:54.560]  We also have about 10,000 products listed in the guide that are third-party verified as non-GMO.
[02:57:54.560 --> 02:57:57.061]  Here are the four ways to avoid GMOs.
[02:57:57.061 --> 02:58:01.103]  One, buy organic, not allowed to intentionally use GMOs.
[02:58:01.103 --> 02:58:04.825]  Two, buy products that say non-GMO on the package.
[02:58:04.825 --> 02:58:07.887]  Three, buy products listed in our shopping guide.
[02:58:07.887 --> 02:58:10.628]  Or four, avoid the at-risk ingredients.
[02:58:11.068 --> 02:58:17.790]  Now, we mentioned 9 GM food crops, but some of these have derivatives, like dextrose and maltodextrin, etc.
[02:58:17.790 --> 02:58:29.073]  Those derivatives are also listed on the guide, and you can find, even in the processed food sections in major supermarkets, products that don't have these derivatives from GMOs.
[02:58:29.073 --> 02:58:29.893]  All right, we're out of time.
[02:58:29.893 --> 02:58:30.933]  We've got to talk to you again soon.
[02:58:30.933 --> 02:58:32.694]  I'm going to do some overdrive to take calls.
[02:58:32.694 --> 02:58:33.854]  Thank you so much, Mr. Smith.
[02:58:33.854 --> 02:58:34.775]  We'll talk to you soon.
[02:58:34.775 --> 02:58:39.876]  By the way, big breaking news at InfoWars.com, right now on IRSgate and more.
[02:58:42.862 --> 02:58:44.587]  Thank you for listening to GCN.
[02:58:44.587 --> 02:58:47.855]  Back tonight, seven central, with InfoWars and Nightly News.
[02:58:51.280 --> 02:58:53.181]  Introducing Pro-1.
[02:58:53.181 --> 02:58:56.823]  All of your filtration in one system, portable, on-the-go.
[02:58:56.823 --> 02:59:01.366]  No more do you have two or three filters to just reduce sodium fluoride.
[02:59:01.366 --> 02:59:07.490]  You have a system that cuts out the sodium fluoride and up to 95% of hydrofluorosilicic acid.
[02:59:07.490 --> 02:59:18.296]  Advanced manufacturing technology combines silver impregnated white ceramic with new Aquamedics advanced media for removal of fluoride and other heavy metals, all in one filter element.
[02:59:18.476 --> 02:59:24.958]  It is the only one that does it, and out of the gates, we have it discounted at 10% off with promo code WATER.
[02:59:24.958 --> 02:59:39.681]  This is the only system that in one unit helps reduce or remove pesticides, herbicides, chloramines, ammonia and chlorine, hydrofluorosilicic acid, the most common form of fluoride not covered by other fluoride filter brands,
[02:59:39.861 --> 02:59:42.263]  Coast-to-coast, direct from Austin.
[02:59:42.263 --> 02:59:44.745]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[03:00:05.990 --> 03:00:10.813]  Big Brother, Mainstream Media, Government Cover-Ups.
[03:00:10.813 --> 03:00:12.394]  You want answers?
[03:00:12.394 --> 03:00:13.935]  Well, so does he.
[03:00:13.935 --> 03:00:18.137]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:00:18.137 --> 03:00:22.980]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[03:00:22.980 --> 03:00:27.163]  Mitch McConnell, Republican leader in the Senate, saying this is only the beginning.
[03:00:27.163 --> 03:00:31.926]  A lot more is about to come out on IRSgate, Spyinggate, Benghazigate.
[03:00:34.013 --> 03:00:38.277]  Everything else, report IRS targeted news anchor after Obama interview.
[03:00:38.277 --> 03:00:43.081]  The guy asked mild questions of Obama, and his family said the IRS is going to come after you.
[03:00:43.081 --> 03:00:45.604]  That's how well known it is, and they did.
[03:00:45.604 --> 03:00:50.488]  Special unit went after pro-Israel Jewish groups.
[03:00:50.488 --> 03:00:51.589]  That's bizarre.
[03:00:51.589 --> 03:00:55.493]  Agency won't say if it will comply with congressional demand for all the documents.
[03:00:56.823 --> 03:01:00.246]  People were aware of conservatives being targeted, but didn't do anything.
[03:01:00.246 --> 03:01:01.067]  That's the White House.
[03:01:01.067 --> 03:01:03.049]  Yeah, the media is all a bunch of crooks, man.
[03:01:03.049 --> 03:01:04.170]  They love it.
[03:01:04.170 --> 03:01:07.393]  Top IRS official, mistakes were made.
[03:01:07.393 --> 03:01:10.075]  Guilty of lack of sensitivity.
[03:01:10.075 --> 03:01:13.499]  Knew of Tea Party targeting for years, but for a year, but didn't reveal.
[03:01:15.549 --> 03:01:18.112]  And AP is angry and disbelief.
[03:01:18.112 --> 03:01:19.714]  I mean, you guys play ball with the New World Order.
[03:01:19.714 --> 03:01:20.996]  You know who you work for.
[03:01:20.996 --> 03:01:23.499]  And there's our article right there on DrudgeReport.com.
[03:01:23.499 --> 03:01:26.563]  Rand Paul, Obama drunk on power.
[03:01:26.563 --> 03:01:30.007]  Maybe they'll attack him for saying that.
[03:01:30.007 --> 03:01:32.110]  That's just some of what's up on DrudgeReport.com.
[03:01:34.431 --> 03:01:37.293]  And then we've got all the stuff up on Infowars.com.
[03:01:37.293 --> 03:01:38.535]  It's all just out of control.
[03:01:38.535 --> 03:01:42.138]  But let's get to some of your phone calls, as promised.
[03:01:42.138 --> 03:01:47.362]  Let's talk to Joshua, because he's 19 years old, concerned with the youth of America.
[03:01:47.362 --> 03:01:48.643]  I'm concerned with everybody, my friend.
[03:01:48.643 --> 03:01:49.404]  We're all in trouble.
[03:01:49.404 --> 03:01:50.885]  Go ahead.
[03:01:50.885 --> 03:01:53.527]  Yes, I'm talking about the youth.
[03:01:53.527 --> 03:01:57.831]  Some of us, we're actually gamers, and it's actually one of my hobbies.
[03:01:57.831 --> 03:02:00.934]  I'm disabled, 19, not able to work, actually.
[03:02:02.839 --> 03:02:15.306]  A lot of the people that are plugged in that just play Call of Duty all day, they're actually a joke to some of the more serious gamers because, you know, they don't really expand their horizons with other games and whatnot.
[03:02:15.306 --> 03:02:21.750]  But I want to thank you for, you know, you're the one reason why I'm awake.
[03:02:21.750 --> 03:02:24.452]  Five years ago, I started listening to your show.
[03:02:24.452 --> 03:02:26.513]  You woke me up.
[03:02:26.513 --> 03:02:27.954]  When I tell people about
[03:02:28.604 --> 03:02:33.311]  Your show and stuff you talk about, you know, GMOs, for instance, they think that I'm crazy.
[03:02:33.311 --> 03:02:37.436]  They look at me with this glazed over look in their eyes.
[03:02:37.436 --> 03:02:39.239]  And it really, it really makes me sad.
[03:02:39.239 --> 03:02:42.103]  But people of my generation, they are
[03:02:43.970 --> 03:02:49.974]  They're asleep, they're on their phones all the time, they don't really want to pay attention to what's going on around them.
[03:02:49.974 --> 03:02:51.355]  They're not living!
[03:02:51.355 --> 03:02:57.779]  They're not living, they're sleeping, plugged into the fake world of mainstream media.
[03:02:57.779 --> 03:03:05.063]  And it's time for all of us to pull back more and more, and at least one day a week, so biblical, unplug from everything.
[03:03:05.063 --> 03:03:08.586]  And our children, it's rewiring their brains early, in a bad way.
[03:03:09.677 --> 03:03:14.602]  Uh, we need to keep kids off the computers as much as possible.
[03:03:14.602 --> 03:03:19.988]  And when people are on the computers, they have, um, the information at their fingertips.
[03:03:19.988 --> 03:03:24.233]  They have an entire, you know, world of information at their fingertips.
[03:03:24.233 --> 03:03:25.013]  But do they use it?
[03:03:25.013 --> 03:03:26.094]  Well, that's the other thing.
[03:03:26.094 --> 03:03:26.475]  Exactly.
[03:03:26.475 --> 03:03:28.517]  The internet could be used for good.
[03:03:28.517 --> 03:03:30.159]  I think we're one of the good influences there.
[03:03:30.159 --> 03:03:30.839]  There's many others.
[03:03:31.846 --> 03:03:37.136]  But yeah, I use it to try to learn things, check things, find things out, share things.
[03:03:37.136 --> 03:03:42.166]  The mainstream culture is designed to dumb us down and make us weak so we can be conquered.
[03:03:42.166 --> 03:03:43.028]  I mean, that's on record.
[03:03:43.857 --> 03:03:52.301]  And so all I can say is, children don't know how to discern and discriminate, so we need to basically keep them off the internet as much as possible.
[03:03:52.301 --> 03:03:56.843]  I mean, parents, you can't just turn your kids over to the government and the globalist media.
[03:03:56.843 --> 03:03:57.823]  God bless you, Joshua.
[03:03:57.823 --> 03:04:01.105]  I appreciate your call and joining us today.
[03:04:01.105 --> 03:04:01.905]  I'm out of time.
[03:04:01.905 --> 03:04:07.247]  Ernest, Anthony, Shelley, if you want to give us your numbers, we'll call you back tomorrow and get you on.
[03:04:07.247 --> 03:04:08.688]  I'll actually do that.
[03:04:08.688 --> 03:04:11.809]  Most hosts don't do that, but I apologize.
[03:04:11.809 --> 03:04:12.870]  I feel terrible every day.
[03:04:13.790 --> 03:04:16.553]  Uh, when I sit there and say, I'll take calls and don't get to as many as I like.
[03:04:16.553 --> 03:04:19.176]  I did an okay job of that, but we probably took 15 calls.
[03:04:19.176 --> 03:04:21.459]  I should, I mean, I, I first don't talk radio.
[03:04:21.459 --> 03:04:23.521]  In fact, I can take 60 calls in an hour.
[03:04:23.521 --> 03:04:24.742]  Cause I was like into taking the calls.
[03:04:24.742 --> 03:04:26.024]  I would just take them and take them and take them.
[03:04:26.024 --> 03:04:27.746]  And now it's the opposite.
[03:04:27.746 --> 03:04:27.846]  Um,
[03:04:29.036 --> 03:04:29.977]  I don't know why I do that.
[03:04:29.977 --> 03:04:31.779]  I think it's almost a subconscious thing.
[03:04:31.779 --> 03:04:32.820]  It's like being interrogated.
[03:04:32.820 --> 03:04:35.803]  I don't know what you're going to come up with and I'll have to think about it.
[03:04:35.803 --> 03:04:40.868]  And so it's almost like I don't cover these big stacks of news I've already looked at because it's like a new world order.
[03:04:40.868 --> 03:04:41.569]  I've got to cut.
[03:04:41.569 --> 03:04:44.271]  You know, it's almost like I don't want to face all this stuff.
[03:04:44.271 --> 03:04:44.912]  You know what I mean?
[03:04:44.912 --> 03:04:46.594]  That's why I don't blame you out there.
[03:04:48.186 --> 03:04:50.551]  You know, for wanting to stick your head in the sand sometimes.
[03:04:50.551 --> 03:04:52.114]  But that won't save us.
[03:04:52.114 --> 03:04:54.599]  We've got to stand up against these globalists.
[03:04:54.599 --> 03:04:58.046]  And we'll cover it all tonight, 7 o'clock Central, InfoWars Nightly News.
