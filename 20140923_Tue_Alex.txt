[00:00.000 --> 00:14.680]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he he's Alex Jones
[00:14.680 --> 00:40.960]  on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones well I'm taking the plunge into a
[00:40.960 --> 00:48.960]  giant cauldron of the good the bad and the ugly there is just so much to cover here today
[00:48.960 --> 00:58.680]  sitting here in my sheet minutes before I was about to go live I couldn't decide what to go
[00:58.680 --> 01:04.200]  to first and then I was looking at one of the TV screens in the control room that was re-airing
[01:04.200 --> 01:12.280]  and re-streaming some of info wars nightly news last night and it showed actual Marine Corps and
[01:12.280 --> 01:23.280]  Army training films where they simulate mowing down Ebola infected crowds of people dressed as
[01:23.280 --> 01:31.520]  zombies I was just sitting here in the control room was CNN and Fox News and info wars nightly
[01:31.520 --> 01:39.520]  news and the refeed of the radio just looking at all these television sets and it was surreal
[01:39.520 --> 01:48.480]  Marine Corps training videos where they practice mowing down zombies and we knew about that a
[01:48.480 --> 01:52.880]  couple years ago that this training was going on all over the country with the Army Marines but
[01:52.880 --> 02:00.480]  now we have the footage that I guess nobody else has got directly from the military hiding in plain
[02:00.480 --> 02:09.000]  view and it was just so strange I was pinching myself as I walked in here about a minute before
[02:09.000 --> 02:14.080]  I went live and I thought what am I going to go on air and talk about because there's too much
[02:14.080 --> 02:21.160]  it's not there's not enough if you give me a wider document cam shot for TV viewers I can
[02:21.160 --> 02:33.480]  describe this for radio listeners I've got 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 stacks of news
[02:33.480 --> 02:45.120]  page after page of video and audio clips and my head is spinning right now it really is spinning
[02:45.120 --> 02:52.440]  because when you study what's going on you get a clear image of it you know that they've pulled
[02:52.440 --> 03:02.000]  the trigger on global mount down again ladies and gentlemen it is Tuesday the 23rd day of September
[03:02.000 --> 03:10.600]  2014 and we have one guest coming on the last 30 minutes TV radio host Lionel political commentator
[03:10.600 --> 03:16.080]  and of course former prosecutor to give us his take on a host of issues but other than that
[03:16.080 --> 03:21.280]  we're gonna have open phones again first-time callers for the first few rounds of calls today
[03:21.280 --> 03:26.560]  to give me your take on any of the stories I mentioned and then I bring up here all I ask
[03:26.560 --> 03:33.000]  is that they pertain to something that is in the news currently happening billionaires are hoarding
[03:33.000 --> 03:40.480]  piles of cash CNBC and then it goes on to break down as the Financial Times reported over the
[03:40.480 --> 03:46.920]  weekend as long as well as the telegraph elites are hoarding gold at a record level while using
[03:46.920 --> 03:54.840]  paper put options and paper naked shorts to try to artificially drive down the price of
[03:54.840 --> 04:01.000]  gold and that's all come out now that's admitted but we're gonna get into why they're doing it
[04:01.000 --> 04:10.920]  so billionaires are hoarding piles of cash that's just one article of about 200 dealing with that
[04:10.920 --> 04:17.560]  we're gonna be breaking it down here's another stack 130,000 Syrian refugees Christians fleeing

[04:33.200 --> 04:39.040]  and Syria have said no this is a pretext to move forces in and take down Assad which is what it is

[09:38.240 --> 09:41.840]  phones up again today will you have a guess the last 30 minutes of the transmission
[09:44.960 --> 09:51.680]  where to start here with all of this over the top news here is the new york times
[09:51.680 --> 10:02.400]  a bowl of cases could reach 1.4 million within four months cdc computers estimate
[10:04.640 --> 10:09.680]  now we were talking about a hundred thousand by december being called fair monitors a week ago
[10:11.200 --> 10:18.320]  but now they're saying 1.4 million in four months the computer models show between
[10:18.320 --> 10:28.560]  half a million on the low end of 1.4 million on the high end with upwards of 90 of those that
[10:28.560 --> 10:33.440]  get it dying now you gotta know when they claim there's only like 3 000 dead so far that that's
[10:33.440 --> 10:40.880]  a whitewash number even though that's the biggest outbreak ever so on the low end to be technical
[10:40.880 --> 10:48.320]  it's 550 000 to the high end 1.4 million ap is also reporting that
[10:54.960 --> 10:58.240]  that's some of the news we're going to be getting to uh here today
[11:00.640 --> 11:07.920]  obviously airstrikes by the us and quote allies hit ices targets in syria these are approved
[11:07.920 --> 11:13.600]  targets by the president but it appears to just be dummy targets they're not actually striking
[11:13.600 --> 11:20.320]  anybody or they may be striking other errant islamicist groups that aren't under their control
[11:20.320 --> 11:29.520]  out of the whole smorgasbord hodgepodge scramble of different wahhabis jihadis from different
[11:29.520 --> 11:38.880]  parts of the world as far away as chechnya and as close to home as from iraq and syria joining in
[11:38.880 --> 11:44.160]  on the head chopping and the blowing up of the churches and the non-radical islamic centers
[11:45.440 --> 11:55.280]  very disgusting to see all of this unfolding and as we expected the u.s ambassador to the
[11:55.280 --> 12:01.600]  united nations yesterday came out and reiterated again that this is about bringing down Assad
[12:01.600 --> 12:06.160]  once they've kicked al qaeda out of the country who is their main fighting force now it's a
[12:06.160 --> 12:11.600]  smokescreen to attack Assad Assad has said that the syrian army has said that now the major
[12:11.600 --> 12:19.600]  shia militias in iraq and syria are in the news today saying that indeed this is nothing but a
[12:19.600 --> 12:27.520]  smokescreen to move u.s forces including boots on the ground and nato forces into syria to topple
[12:27.520 --> 12:34.800]  the regime airstrikes by us and allies hit isis targets in syria the united states and
[12:34.800 --> 12:41.600]  allies launched airstrikes against suny militants in syria early today unleashing a torrent of
[12:41.600 --> 12:47.760]  cruise missiles and precision guided bombs from the air and sea on the militants de facto capital
[12:47.760 --> 12:58.080]  of how do you pronounce that r a qqa and along the porous iraq border american fighter jets and
[12:58.080 --> 13:04.560]  arm predator and reaper drones flying alongside warplanes from several arab allies struck a
[13:04.560 --> 13:09.200]  broad array of targets in the territory control by the militants known as the islamic state american
[13:09.200 --> 13:14.560]  defense officials to the targets including weapons supplies depots barracks and buildings
[13:14.560 --> 13:18.560]  the militants used for command and control tomahawk cruise missiles were fired from
[13:18.560 --> 13:23.040]  united states and navy ships in the region the strikes are a major turning point and
[13:23.040 --> 13:27.360]  president obama's war against the islamic state who he started arming four years ago
[13:27.920 --> 13:33.520]  and opened up a risky new stage of american military campaign until now the administration
[13:33.520 --> 13:38.640]  had bombed islamic state targets only in iraq and it suggested it would be weeks if not months before
[13:38.640 --> 13:47.600]  start of the bombing campaign against islamic state targets in syria of course we can half ago
[13:47.600 --> 13:51.920]  the so-called moderates were all meeting in the building in syria and it got blown up
[13:54.400 --> 14:04.800]  raka is the name of the city raka so we can't believe any of this there's lots of videos of
[14:04.800 --> 14:12.960]  the familiar cruise missiles being launched off the decks of destroyers islamic state attack on
[14:12.960 --> 14:20.880]  iraq base leaves hundreds missing shows army's weakness the army base in iraq's western
[14:20.880 --> 14:26.240]  onbar province has been under siege by islamic state militants for a week so in a convoy of
[14:26.240 --> 14:32.240]  armored humvees rolled to the gate the iraq soldiers that camp believed saviors had arrived but this
[14:32.240 --> 14:37.920]  was no rescue attempt the vehicles were driven by militants on suicide missions and within seconds
[14:37.920 --> 14:45.920]  on sunday the base had become a bloody scene of multiple bombings that's the kind of stuff going
[14:45.920 --> 14:51.760]  on over there with islamic state allowed to have a base in syria and now turning it against iraq
[14:51.760 --> 15:00.640]  islamic state has now put out a taunting speech calling for the killing of civilians
[15:03.040 --> 15:09.600]  and calling for attacks in the united states and europe
[15:11.840 --> 15:15.600]  and of course this will be used as we predicted it wasn't hard to predict
[15:15.600 --> 15:21.040]  we predicted years ago that the radical islamists has been given libya and syria and areas of iraq
[15:21.040 --> 15:27.040]  and areas of africa would then be allowed to attack the west and then they would take more of our
[15:27.040 --> 15:33.440]  freedoms and legitimize the nsa spying and the microphones and sculptures in chicago and austin
[15:33.440 --> 15:39.120]  texas and the stingray system stealing our cell phone data and listening to us without warrants
[15:39.120 --> 15:45.200]  and lifetime it'll all be used as why we had to give our freedoms up even though in plain view
[15:45.200 --> 15:50.800]  criminal elements of our government armed them that's why this is so important and here's a
[15:50.800 --> 15:58.000]  clip from the communist news network where isis calls for attacks in the u.s and europe
[16:00.320 --> 16:05.600]  these are the fighters isis is preparing to be stone cold killers featured in a new training camp
[16:05.600 --> 16:11.600]  video and tonight a new audio tape threatening attacks on the u.s homeland is drawing a strong
[16:11.600 --> 16:17.520]  response from washington the u.s official tells cnn law enforcement and counterterrorism officials
[16:17.520 --> 16:23.280]  are working with foreign partners to thwart this threat a threat made by a senior isis leader
[16:23.280 --> 16:28.240]  who for the first time specifically calls for lone wolf attacks inside western countries
[16:30.720 --> 16:36.640]  reach the roads with explosives for them attack their bases raid their homes cut off their heads
[16:36.640 --> 16:42.400]  do not let them feel secure remove their families from their homes and thereafter blow up their homes
[16:42.400 --> 16:48.160]  could this audio tape activate someone who's in isis or even a sympathizer inside the u.s
[16:48.160 --> 16:52.160]  to conduct a lone wolf attack yeah and then they'll get out and go take my guns because you let them
[16:52.160 --> 16:58.240]  do it keeps pushing that message for individuals within the united states within european countries
[16:58.240 --> 17:04.160]  to simply act out the islamic state could be trying to do the same thing the isis leader also
[17:04.160 --> 17:10.320]  specifically calls for attacks on us allies france and australia just days ago australian authorities
[17:10.320 --> 17:16.880]  say they disrupted just such an attack in sydney in the new training video isis is refining its
[17:16.880 --> 17:24.000]  military tactics and shows it's able to attract more westerners they see this as a serious organization
[17:24.000 --> 17:31.920]  that really wants to fight not just talk about it to be a warrior and this is part and parcel of
[17:31.920 --> 17:37.120]  making that transition from being a civilian to being a warrior in the minds of these recruits
[17:37.120 --> 17:42.560]  this is one man who could be drawing them in the flames of war are only beginning to intensify
[17:42.560 --> 17:48.320]  u.s intelligence officials now say this man seen in a recent video apparently executing syrians
[17:48.320 --> 17:53.600]  could be an american oh he thinks voice analysis is underway and officials tell us they're concerned
[17:53.600 --> 17:57.920]  this could be the first time they're seeing an american in a position of apparent authority
[17:57.920 --> 18:03.280]  inside isis further evidence of westerners getting recruited to join jihad and syria
[18:03.280 --> 18:10.240]  this video showing isis fighters from britain now tonight just hours after that isis spokesman
[18:10.240 --> 18:15.120]  called on foreign fighters to carry out attacks inside the u.s a senior obama administration
[18:15.120 --> 18:19.840]  official warned that the international community is not prepared to respond to such calls the
[18:19.840 --> 18:25.680]  official saying okay there you go not structured that way there you go ladies and gentlemen if
[18:25.680 --> 18:29.840]  you look at who headed up al qaeda this is just al qaeda rebranded with a whole new generation
[18:29.840 --> 18:40.320]  that's been trained guaranteed those western so-called leaders of isis you saw are working
[18:40.320 --> 18:52.000]  for western intelligence agencies mi6 cia massad it's on record that adam gadon was a western
[18:52.000 --> 18:57.040]  operative heading up al qaeda do you really believe these people are following westerners
[18:57.040 --> 19:01.520]  and not knowing who gives them weapons who gives them stinger missiles who gives them intel
[19:02.320 --> 19:09.280]  and it's their job produce scary videos and to go around to all this bad stuff so then the west
[19:09.280 --> 19:15.280]  can wind up useful idiot jihadis who are being commanded by isis who will really think they're
[19:15.280 --> 19:21.360]  attacking america to blow up schools shoot up schools attack shopping malls and then they're
[19:21.360 --> 19:25.520]  going to say we got to have checkpoints inside shopping malls and that's it everybody's going
[19:25.520 --> 19:30.960]  to turn their guns in if no guns are allowed then there's no way that akmed habib
[19:31.920 --> 19:37.120]  rajaga made up name could have gone into the gun shop and bought the weapons i mean you

[24:31.600 --> 24:37.520]  western ally that is not basically trying to bring down Syria right now
[24:38.720 --> 24:48.960]  in that whole region Turkey Israel Saudi Arabia Qatar the NATO countries the United States are all
[24:48.960 --> 24:57.040]  all aiding the jihadis the al-qaeda is to bring down Syria that's 95% of the fighting force
[24:57.040 --> 25:05.600]  mainstream news says 65 70% no it's 95% and they just go oh you're the non-radical islamists
[25:05.600 --> 25:10.480]  here's the weapons 600 tons of them last year and then they hand them right to al-qaeda but
[25:10.480 --> 25:14.480]  because the public woke up to that the military woke up they now call them ISIL and all the rest
[25:14.480 --> 25:19.760]  of it well the public didn't buy that so now they're doing some bombing of them let me tell
[25:19.760 --> 25:25.760]  you it was really bombing is yesterday syrian aircraft in the golan heights near the israeli
[25:25.760 --> 25:33.520]  border fighter bomber coming in low in fierce battles with al-qaeda ap reports that in fierce
[25:33.520 --> 25:42.800]  battles with is and israel shot down the syrian aircraft first time that's happened in 30 years
[25:42.800 --> 25:55.360]  ap reports 30 years since that happened and now israel if saying they did it on purpose they
[25:55.360 --> 26:00.960]  say it came a little bit in their airspace the people out there that support israel just mindlessly
[26:01.600 --> 26:06.080]  israel's diverse israel has a lot of different political views and five or six political parties
[26:06.080 --> 26:13.840]  even if you aren't against israel or pro-israel you need to be able to criticize israel when
[26:13.840 --> 26:19.280]  it's doing bad things just like i don't like our government arming isis i don't like israel
[26:19.280 --> 26:25.360]  giving field support to isis and the jihadis and medical support that's been in the israeli papers
[26:25.360 --> 26:31.280]  for a year that israel is supporting the jihadis to bring down syria and the arguments well we
[26:31.280 --> 26:37.680]  don't like syria this will what to then turn it over to the jihadis that's how you completely lose
[26:37.680 --> 26:42.480]  the moral high ground and people know i've not been in a critic of israel but i tell you this makes
[26:42.480 --> 26:48.000]  me want to throw up just like it makes me want to throw up about saudi arabia but what do you
[26:48.000 --> 26:53.280]  expect or our corrupt government look at this article out of your own is syrian fighter jet
[26:53.280 --> 26:58.880]  shot down by israel over the golan heights first such incident in almost 30 years israel shot down
[26:58.880 --> 27:04.320]  a syrian fighter jet over the golan heights syria has described the shooting as an act of aggression
[27:04.320 --> 27:10.400]  think so earlier the israeli military said it appeared the syrian plane had crossed by accident
[27:10.400 --> 27:14.880]  into israeli controlled airspace over the golan heights the area has been the scene of fierce
[27:14.880 --> 27:22.320]  battles in recent weeks between the al qaeda linked al nazar affront and the forces of the syrian
[27:22.320 --> 27:30.240]  government and the and president basher Assad so that's what's really going on when you try to
[27:30.240 --> 27:35.920]  bomb isis not when you go out and bomb a couple of Toyota trucks parked on a hilltop looks completely
[27:35.920 --> 27:45.440]  rigged here's another one us allies hit melligan targets in syria kill 11 civilians press tv i mean
[27:45.440 --> 27:52.480]  who knows if any of that's even true pentagon sites new terror threat as isis war gets underway
[27:52.480 --> 27:59.200]  shadowy terror group use a justify illegal and unconstitutional attack in syria isis turkeys
[27:59.200 --> 28:04.720]  tool for reestablishing the caliphate and i i i got a hand at tom i remember when glenn beck and
[28:04.720 --> 28:10.080]  others were having drum coursey and other people on talking about a caliphate and the plan to launch
[28:10.080 --> 28:15.120]  one with turkey behind it and i'm like give me a break a new caliphate or ottoman empire and now
[28:15.120 --> 28:21.760]  it's happening so i'm not always first to say something and i'm not always right i i mean i
[28:21.760 --> 28:26.800]  just can't believe how bold the west is to openly fund these groups turn them loose in six different
[28:26.800 --> 28:33.200]  countries at least and then turn around like we're stupid and say we're gonna arm them to fight them
[28:35.200 --> 28:42.000]  i want to talk first time callers military police people in israel people in syria people in lebanon

[29:10.240 --> 29:15.760]  that's a more loving death than turning it over to al-qaeda to every christian non radical muslim
[29:15.760 --> 29:23.040]  and jew have their head chopped off i mean is it anti israel or anti nato or anti america
[29:23.600 --> 29:27.760]  if we don't nuke syria right now and and raise the al-qaeda flag over the white house
[29:27.760 --> 29:30.960]  maybe i've been radical maybe i've been an extremist maybe these policies are good

[34:15.920 --> 34:21.920]  that this is all being done to topple Assad of course it is who is basically the arch enemy

[34:47.680 --> 34:54.880]  happening behind that moron abola cases could reach 1.4 million in four months cdc estimates
[34:54.880 --> 35:00.400]  that's non info wars dot com that told you that a long time ago that's the precious new york times
[35:02.080 --> 35:08.880]  so now it officially happened because they said so uh continuing fbi gags state and local police
[35:09.440 --> 35:16.240]  on capabilities of cell phone spy gear and the uh doppelganger cell towers they're putting up
[35:16.960 --> 35:20.160]  all over the country that's why you see police chiefs going we don't know
[35:20.160 --> 35:24.960]  what these towers are but we're sure it's not law enforcement because that would be illegal
[35:28.320 --> 35:34.400]  like the fbi's god just 30 years ago in this country local police wouldn't do anything the
[35:34.400 --> 35:38.640]  fbi said unless they had a court order because it was called jurisdiction
[35:41.120 --> 35:46.880]  now they've been so federalized and been made deputies in so many cases that when they say
[35:46.880 --> 35:52.080]  they jump they ask how high when they are about to literally go in a bathroom stall at the local
[35:52.080 --> 35:57.520]  police departments in this country now and close the door they call the fbi up to ask you know when
[35:57.520 --> 36:03.120]  they can go and i'm not even being sarcastic it has gotten to that point where they ask the fbi
[36:03.680 --> 36:10.720]  if they can put ketchup on their french fries it's beyond federalization it is sick of fanatic
[36:10.720 --> 36:17.120]  and over the top well let me just give everybody a news flash um i know the fbi is very upset about
[36:17.120 --> 36:20.080]  the fact that i talk about this we're going to continue talking about it until the very end it
[36:20.080 --> 36:24.160]  doesn't matter we win we're committed we chose to do the right thing it doesn't matter what you do to
[36:24.160 --> 36:29.920]  us we're going to tell the truth this is illegal it's part of parallel construction everything's
[36:29.920 --> 36:36.160]  being spied on without warrants it's part of social control and they can't ever let the public know
[36:36.160 --> 36:43.360]  about it because it was premeditated it is racketeering it is organized crime you fbi guys
[36:43.360 --> 36:48.720]  went to school to learn what those terms mean so you can look in the mirror now the average
[36:48.720 --> 36:53.840]  low-level fbi agents involved in bank robberies and missing persons but mid-level high-level
[36:53.840 --> 36:59.600]  they are in on the game and the black cats sitting their offices laughing at the goody tissues
[36:59.600 --> 37:06.240]  basically the fbi is lakosa nostra in this country that's why they took down lakosa
[37:06.240 --> 37:10.880]  nostra in the 50s is that lakosa nostra had been blackmailing the fbi and they said you know what
[37:10.880 --> 37:15.360]  it's time for you to learn who the boss is around here and that's what happened
[37:16.640 --> 37:21.920]  and he got rivalries when the fbi and the cia and i got to be honest i don't know who's worse fbi
[37:21.920 --> 37:30.800]  or cia i see the cia doing absolutely horrible stuff all over the place but then the cia people
[37:30.800 --> 37:34.320]  i've known throughout my life and run into and i've seen the congressional testimonies they all
[37:34.320 --> 37:39.840]  sound just like me and absolutely hate what's going on a lot of fbi agents don't like what's
[37:39.840 --> 37:44.560]  going on either but they're so compartmentalized and i've seen over a hundred this was even on
[37:44.560 --> 37:50.080]  new york times you can pull it up fbi created almost all terror plots is the headline and they
[37:50.080 --> 37:54.400]  just go find mentally ill people and try to get them to carry out a terror attack and then put
[37:54.400 --> 38:01.280]  them in prison for life i mean it's not good to find a 72 iq person that can hardly talk and try
[38:01.280 --> 38:10.400]  to get them to blow up the christmas event in uh in portland it's not cool there it is new york
[38:10.400 --> 38:17.280]  times sunday review terrorist plot half by the fbi that's hatched the united states has been
[38:17.280 --> 38:23.280]  narrowly saved from lethal terrorist plots in recent years or so it seemed a would-be suicide
[38:23.280 --> 38:27.680]  bomber was intercepted on his way to the capital a scheme to bomb synagogues and shoot stinger
[38:27.680 --> 38:32.480]  missiles military aircraft was developed by men in new burrow new york and a fanciful idea to fly
[38:32.480 --> 38:37.040]  explosive latent model planes and the pentagon and the capital was hatched in massachusetts
[38:38.240 --> 38:44.880]  but all of these dramas were facilitated by the fbi whose undercover agents and informers
[38:44.880 --> 38:51.440]  pose as terrorists offering a dummy missile fake c4 explosives a disarmed suicide vest
[38:51.440 --> 38:57.840]  and rudimentary training the suspects naively played their parts until they were arrested
[38:58.560 --> 39:01.840]  yeah and i mean it's one thing if you go out and ask somebody you think's planning an attack
[39:01.840 --> 39:05.200]  hey you want to do an attack and they say yeah and you bust them great you stopped a real attack
[39:05.200 --> 39:11.120]  but when you're just justifying budget there's the guardian government agents directly involved
[39:11.120 --> 39:18.320]  in most high-level us terror plots and we've seen these cases you remember at the rnc where there's
[39:18.320 --> 39:25.760]  this video back four or five years ago of these young dumb kids like i don't want to blow the
[39:25.760 --> 39:30.720]  mall off cocktails i want to go home to mommy i booked an airline flight tomorrow i'm leaving
[39:31.680 --> 39:37.040]  it sent to prison i'm not gonna bomb anything no i want mommy
[39:37.040 --> 39:44.880]  i mean all you do is totally discredit yourselves and so now see i said i'd get to this i'm gonna
[39:44.880 --> 39:51.600]  go to your calls fbi gag state and local police on capabilities of cell phone spy gear
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.960]  it says it requires state local police to keep quiet about the capabilities of the
[39:58.960 --> 40:02.720]  controversial type of surveillance gear that allows law enforcement to e-drop on cell phone calls
[40:02.720 --> 40:07.040]  and track individual people based on signals emitted by their cell phone devices according to
[40:07.040 --> 40:13.200]  bureau document released recently under freedom information act request and it just goes on
[40:14.160 --> 40:18.960]  folks when people in chicago or austin go look at this new cell tower they go that's just fake
[40:18.960 --> 40:25.360]  never mind it uh it's not fake it's a separate cell tower we have the documents from insiders
[40:25.360 --> 40:33.120]  in chicago in washington in seattle in austin texas years ago we know what they're doing
[40:33.680 --> 40:40.480]  so that's an example what's coming up gok gop obama care bending over backwards for
[40:40.480 --> 40:47.760]  illegals illegal illegal immigration a new wave of central american kids will reach the u.s soon
[40:47.760 --> 40:55.120]  according to experts and just like they lie about the nsa surveillance or the stingray cell towers
[40:56.240 --> 41:01.360]  they'll say we don't know where the kids are coming from we get a tip from ice go to the border
[41:02.400 --> 41:07.840]  and there are the buses pulling in loading the kids with vouchers with their parents on buses
[41:07.840 --> 41:13.840]  to be sent anywhere they want without ids just like we told you and it's now been confirmed
[41:13.840 --> 41:20.960]  that they let the illegals fly with no ids the point is none of it has to do with security
[41:20.960 --> 41:27.440]  it has to do with us being pinned farm animals on the government slaughterhouse reservation
[41:27.440 --> 41:32.960]  literally lied to about everything preyed upon and the government's just sitting back
[41:33.520 --> 41:40.080]  in a giant criminal conspiracy doing whatever they want whenever they want bringing in drugs

[42:36.880 --> 42:41.600]  to be more libertarian of the whole constellation of globalists so i'm not lionizing him i'm just
[42:41.600 --> 42:48.080]  saying i've seen some good science still if if i was a billionaire and i was peter thiel i would
[42:48.080 --> 42:53.520]  be wanting life extension for myself and my family the elite have made the decision that the public's
[42:53.520 --> 43:01.520]  not to get this now when in game came out the new york times of all places did a review of it did a

[43:15.200 --> 43:19.120]  he believes that world government's being formed so the elite can merge with machines and basically
[43:19.120 --> 43:27.840]  live forever well i didn't say that i'm gonna explain something again here if i quote hitler it doesn't
[43:27.840 --> 43:37.520]  mean i'm hitler if i quote christ it doesn't mean i'm christ if i quote uh muhammad ghandi it doesn't
[43:37.520 --> 43:45.040]  mean i'm muhammad ghandi this the film has their quotes and where they said it and how they would
[43:45.040 --> 43:52.960]  release airborne abola and stuff like that this film came out seven years ago
[43:55.680 --> 44:02.080]  so we're going to play a clip of the three-hour film coming up after phone calls mike mick ryan
[44:02.080 --> 44:08.880]  erin rambo and others if you just joined us the west is openly arming al-qaeda rebranding
[44:08.880 --> 44:15.840]  and isle isis is to confuse the public and to confound them israel is shot down a fighter bomber
[44:15.840 --> 44:22.240]  that came into its airspace was trying to fight al-qaeda forces that's ap you've got the west
[44:22.240 --> 44:28.720]  and and turkey aiding them they allowed to travel back and forth between turkey and england so what
[44:28.720 --> 44:34.000]  is your take on obama without congressional approval he came out and said congress is trying to give
[44:34.000 --> 44:41.280]  me an authorization i don't need an authorization obama ignores congress again to launch syrian
[44:41.280 --> 44:48.000]  attack with no legal basis president commits impeachable offense paul joseph watson info wars
[44:48.000 --> 44:53.280]  dot com i want to get your take specifically on this mike in canada you're on the air
[44:55.040 --> 44:59.840]  hey alex so basically i just i had a question for you and usually you're pretty good at breaking
[44:59.840 --> 45:06.880]  down uh socially what it means and my question is is how can you take something so fake in
[45:06.880 --> 45:12.400]  such a facade like this jihad and have so many people willing to fight and put their lives on
[45:12.400 --> 45:18.800]  the line yet when you look at your country united states this beautiful country hardly anybody is
[45:18.800 --> 45:27.600]  willing to put up a fight your own military isn't even taking back the country you're right uh
[45:27.600 --> 45:32.000]  because it's primitive here's the bad guys crawling through burning cinder here's the
[45:32.000 --> 45:36.320]  guys in black uniforms they say they're gonna kill you and people could say okay go kill them
[45:36.320 --> 45:43.520]  protect me it's like a remote control mentality or an instant drive-through mentality where we're
[45:43.520 --> 45:51.280]  a nation by and large not of trailblazers not of innovators but of sickly uh phony tough
[45:51.280 --> 46:01.120]  uh sycophants and that is for the average private citizen is for the average government person
[46:01.120 --> 46:09.200]  we are a corrupt nation now that has killed 54 million babies and rationalize that so they're
[46:09.200 --> 46:13.360]  going to rationalize death panels for old people they're going to rationalize secret death panels
[46:13.360 --> 46:18.720]  and death lists for veterans they're going to rationalize ronam annuals brother wrote a op-ed
[46:18.720 --> 46:24.240]  piece i've got it here in the stack i'm gonna get to by the time it ties into in-game it ties into
[46:24.240 --> 46:31.280]  peter thiel saying why it's good to die at 75 that's the name or i think it's why i hope to die
[46:31.280 --> 46:36.640]  it's trying to pull it up guys i can't find it here in the stack i saw it this morning the stories
[46:36.640 --> 46:42.320]  up on info wars dot com saying it's time to kill people basically at 75 and then it'll be time at
[46:42.320 --> 46:48.400]  70 and then 65 that somehow if we lower the quality of the civilization if somebody else
[46:48.400 --> 46:55.600]  loses i win there it is why i hope to die at 75 i bet you a lot of money that he doesn't want to
[46:55.600 --> 47:01.200]  die at 75 an argument that society and families and you will be better off if nature takes its
[47:01.200 --> 47:07.360]  course swiftly and promptly so see they've gone from there are no death panels to him saying yes
[47:07.360 --> 47:16.720]  there are death panels and uh we need to force people into them ladies and gentlemen we had
[47:16.720 --> 47:21.920]  whistleblowers on the show they have tens of thousands of people young military old you name
[47:21.920 --> 47:26.560]  it who they go in and you're not going to be given care just not going to happen they're going to be
[47:26.560 --> 47:31.840]  given pills to go home and die because we don't want to take care of you and they sold the idea
[47:32.400 --> 47:37.920]  that that we save money by killing you instead of just more fiat money build the infrastructure
[47:37.920 --> 47:44.400]  they created fiat money to tie our wealth to it to bankrupt us instead of using fiat to build the
[47:44.400 --> 47:54.000]  civilizations we could and this is leering evil out in the open and i bet you money a zikule manual
[47:54.000 --> 48:01.440]  who is just again this is about evil leering in our face and just accustoming us because they
[48:01.440 --> 48:07.520]  believe we have no soul now they believe we have no compass no rudder no moral connection the churches
[48:07.520 --> 48:13.760]  won't fight it the churches won't criticize it their government run in most cases and so we're
[48:13.760 --> 48:19.440]  helpless to them so now they're leaning down going there are death panels and we are going to reduce
[48:19.440 --> 48:24.480]  world population and we do need to kill babies up to age three and you know what we really are
[48:24.480 --> 48:31.520]  going to kill you and so that's why america is like this europe's the same way now uh wealth turned
[48:31.520 --> 48:35.280]  us into demons and now we're going to lose everything does that answer your question mike
[48:36.000 --> 48:42.400]  well you know just just think about it back in 2009 the american people had something like uh
[48:42.400 --> 48:48.960]  400 billion dollars stolen from them uh we fast forward to clinton saying we came we conquered
[48:49.680 --> 48:55.360]  with uh gaddafi and then you have pictures with john mccain sitting with these people
[48:55.360 --> 49:00.880]  that you're supposed to be fighting i mean like like max keiser said do they need to come into
[49:00.880 --> 49:06.160]  your house and rape your wife in front of you before you do anything oh well then they would
[49:06.160 --> 49:11.680]  just say it was for law enforcement purposes that's it we are a morally bankrupt country
[49:11.680 --> 49:19.840]  there is nothing there so mccain can meet with the heads of isis and that's just the way it is
[49:21.680 --> 49:27.280]  and just like carl row famously said they control reality they will change what history supposedly
[49:27.280 --> 49:32.880]  is tomorrow and we'll go along with it and if we do well that's what we deserve i appreciate your

[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:14.000]  walking down the street waving a gun for no reason naked they're on psychotropic g that person
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:19.200]  just sliced their kids arms off with a hatchet they're on psychotropic g that person just went
[01:01:19.200 --> 01:01:26.560]  to school and shot a bunch of people i bet they're gonna be on psychotropic why 99 plus percent
[01:01:26.560 --> 01:01:30.320]  of the time because i can hardly find any cases out of hundreds and hundreds where it wasn't the case
[01:01:31.120 --> 01:01:37.920]  where they weren't on them because the inserts of the drugs say it can put you into a complete
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:49.040]  fantasy land and you make psychotropics with uh stuff like xanax oh you're really in cuckoo land now
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:53.040]  i mean are there crazy people that are so nuts you can give them drugs and it makes them better
[01:01:53.040 --> 01:02:00.240]  yeah i have no doubt those drugs don't help some people but statistically they are time bombs
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:08.720]  and they're very bad for your liver very bad for your body have you read those side effects
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:13.440]  i got a friend who's been on paxil for 15 years and they admit he's got all these health problems
[01:02:13.440 --> 01:02:19.520]  in valigo you know the thing where you look like your vampire michael jackson had it and they the
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:26.240]  doctor said no your the paxil did it and guess what he can't go off of it it's totally depressed
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:30.400]  he goes off of it uh ryan and alabama you go ahead and finish up this short segment with
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:36.160]  your question or comment uh yes thanks it's uh funny that you bring that up out it's like
[01:02:36.160 --> 01:02:41.520]  you read my mind because the first thing they pulled out that guy's car that killed all those
[01:02:41.520 --> 01:02:46.960]  people this morning was half a bottle of xanax and half a bottle of prozac i didn't even see it
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:52.720]  guys look up shooting in alabama today so so they admitted that well thank god usually the cops are
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:03:00.080]  told to shut up the cops openly said he we found we found drugs no no you were not here about this
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:05.840]  i have being a former drug addict of course i have friends in the police department down there and
[01:03:05.840 --> 01:03:10.560]  that was what he told me they pulled half a bottle of prozac and half a bottle of xanax so this guy's
[01:03:10.560 --> 01:03:18.160]  car you're kidding people and then himself you know that's crazy you called in about the shooting i
[01:03:18.160 --> 01:03:23.120]  didn't know you were about to talk about drugs and you're saying i i wish your police source off
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:28.640]  record would call me so i could confirm that so that we could then say police sources uh because
[01:03:28.640 --> 01:03:36.800]  that is so important i'll try to that happens wow so your friend who is in the police department
[01:03:36.800 --> 01:03:44.240]  what did they tell you they said they found his car parked down the parking lot of ways
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:49.600]  first thing they opened it up pack a cigarette second thing half a bottle of prozac third thing
[01:03:49.600 --> 01:03:56.720]  half a bottle of xanax and no doubt it was some major contributor i mean
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:03.120]  oh yeah happens every day but i'll tell you xanax is even worse than the prozac family
[01:04:03.120 --> 01:04:08.240]  because i just i read the news every day so i see it that xanax will literally put people
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:13.280]  in a complete trench where they don't even know who they are and then they'll just pick their gun up
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:21.200]  and just you know just go shoot somebody really sad yep it cost four people their lives this morning

[01:10:21.760 --> 01:10:26.000]  they approached us about doing a cart years ago the obama deception they suspended it and they
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:33.040]  said it's racist you can't criticize a black man that's right if it's our lord and savior obama
[01:10:33.040 --> 01:10:37.360]  uh to quote jamie fox because i'm not calling more than say that would be blasphemous i'm quoting
[01:10:37.360 --> 01:10:42.560]  jamie fox but peter field the billionaire tech entrepreneur is on a mission to cheat death that's
[01:10:42.560 --> 01:10:48.080]  coming up at the bottom of the hour but now let's go to your calls erin in missouri you're on the
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:55.840]  year go ahead hey alex can you hear me yes sir how you doing alex uh good i've been listening
[01:10:55.840 --> 01:11:03.200]  since 2006 uh you you know were the first to wake me up uh this is the first time i've ever been
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:12.000]  able to call so but uh going back to that last call at first second you know in 2006 i didn't
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:18.080]  see anybody wearing any sort of you know revolutionary libertarian shirts at all
[01:11:18.080 --> 01:11:21.680]  i actually had one made on the front that said turn off the tv and read down the back
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:26.960]  instead welcome to the new world order but uh i was wondering i'm i'm actually wearing a uh
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:34.320]  moa laba shirt right now i was wondering if liam akadu would uh approach me that's a good one
[01:11:34.320 --> 01:11:40.560]  what i'm saying is is that when you wear liberty based attire you will meet like-minded people
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:49.680]  and that will let you form a community in your area right um i just the main reason i call this
[01:11:49.680 --> 01:11:57.520]  is about this uh plane being shot down over over israel and they i haven't really heard much about
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:12:03.920]  it at all on the tv that you know this morning there well it was shot down in the edge of israeli
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:11.360]  airspace uh they claim and israel has been giving support people that run israel to isis
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:16.400]  they're over the golan heights that's been in the jerusalem post and just like i'm angry
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:20.880]  that our government's doing it or anybody else is doing it i'm upset that israel's doing that and
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:29.280]  now uh even ap reports that the jet was uh bombing al qaeda forces uh and israel's response was to
[01:12:29.280 --> 01:12:34.560]  shoot it down and israel's been supplying ambulance and medical field support they're in the golan
[01:12:34.560 --> 01:12:39.920]  heights to the jihadis uh just like turkey's been doing that bordering uh i mean it's it's like israel
[01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:46.480]  turkey the united states france england germany shawty arabia qatar they're all ganged up on syria
[01:12:46.480 --> 01:12:52.160]  who didn't do anything and in my book you don't gang up on a country hadn't done anything to bring
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:57.920]  them down and then say well al qaeda is evil but we're gonna let them take over because you know
[01:12:57.920 --> 01:13:03.760]  they're better than a sod no they're not it's immoral to start fights it's immoral to do this
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:08.480]  and it shows what we've turned into erin thank you for the call rambo in florida thanks for holding
[01:13:08.480 --> 01:13:14.400]  you're on the air thanks alex uh great show so far um i'm originally from iraq but live here in
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:18.880]  the states but been back and forth between uh here in north africa for the past few years
[01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:24.480]  and um i think it's obvious for people if they want to know how this plays out in syria i believe
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:29.760]  it's libya 2.0 i mean we've openly seen what happened to libya when you murder remove a sovereign
[01:13:29.760 --> 01:13:35.200]  dictator um the goal is destabilization it's now a failed state they now get to loot all the
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:40.160]  infrastructure there's now no electricity tens of thousands die every six months and they admit
[01:13:40.160 --> 01:13:45.200]  it's quote ten times worse was the washington post article a few months ago there than it was
[01:13:45.200 --> 01:13:51.360]  and that and that obama screwed up no they didn't screw up the plan is bring these continents down
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:57.440]  i'm sorry i'm ranting go ahead no uh you're exactly right and uh just two more quick points um
[01:13:57.440 --> 01:14:03.040]  basically i mean not it's not publicized but it's it's pretty well known that fifth group uh since
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:07.840]  prior to 2001 actually but especially after 2001 fifth group has you know establishing african
[01:14:07.840 --> 01:14:12.640]  and the rest of it in the southern in the southern part of these countries morocco ajaria tunis libya
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:17.600]  egypt and the southern less densely populated areas they've been setting up these groups
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:22.240]  four years four four years you never hear about moroccan train groups but they're down there in
[01:14:22.240 --> 01:14:27.280]  the western state are doing what they got to do and uh just one more quick point um actually last
[01:14:28.320 --> 01:14:33.440]  august in the 16 and 17th i was up in chicago i just want to get your uh your point on this i
[01:14:33.440 --> 01:14:38.240]  actually got a chance to speak to lewis ferrican for about five six minutes in heat i actually
[01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:42.720]  we're talking about libya and i actually you know just brought up your your breakdown of libya
[01:14:42.720 --> 01:14:48.240]  which i i echo i agree completely with your breakdown and his uh response was extremely
[01:14:48.240 --> 01:14:52.480]  positive and actually mentioned that they break down a number of your clips and their little
[01:14:52.480 --> 01:14:56.880]  meetings that they have in the morning that uh have you ever thought about getting lewis ferrican
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:03.840]  on the show and i'll uh i'll get off down here i've we've contacted lewis ferrican and his people
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:08.480]  and they said that they're aware of our work and agree with a lot of it uh and that they might think
[01:15:08.480 --> 01:15:14.000]  about someday coming on the show i know he's a very polarizing figure a lot of people have demonizing
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:21.440]  i don't agree with some of his statements um but a lot of it is meant to be brash to get people's
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:27.200]  attention he he agreed with me on pierce morgan and is against having our guns taken so ferrican has
[01:15:27.200 --> 01:15:34.000]  made statements about the show before um the nation of islam exposes vaccines they say black
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:38.480]  should spend their money in their neighborhoods and build their own society i i agree with that
[01:15:38.480 --> 01:15:43.120]  i don't think you should add the statement you know that the arab's and the asians are in their
[01:15:43.120 --> 01:15:46.560]  you know blood sucking off of them i mean if somebody doesn't build a business people don't
[01:15:46.560 --> 01:15:54.800]  shop at black businesses and then uh you know that's their fault uh but um i do know that but
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:15:59.040]  listen it's not just the nation of islam that watches this show and listens it's the japanese
[01:15:59.040 --> 01:16:07.680]  government it's the russian government it's our government i'm not bragging it's true that we're
[01:16:07.680 --> 01:16:13.680]  the number one show in the u.s military hands down and it's not just the content because the
[01:16:13.680 --> 01:16:17.840]  military listens and goes man this guy knows what he's talking about other shows dumb down their
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:23.680]  content it's not that i'm even that smart or good it's that i raise our content to the level
[01:16:23.680 --> 01:16:29.440]  level partway towards the military level people go oh yeah military intelligence ha ha ha they're
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:33.600]  a bunch of idiots no they're not the military the non-commissioned officers the officers
[01:16:34.160 --> 01:16:38.800]  did anybody have any idea how complex sophisticated how hard working those people are
[01:16:41.360 --> 01:16:46.480]  it's just unbelievable that's why the system is so scared of them because they know they can hear
[01:16:46.480 --> 01:16:53.840]  a show like this and understand it that's why police despite all their problems with the system trying
[01:16:53.840 --> 01:16:59.120]  to twist them are natural allies of liberty movement because they're uncompartimentalized
[01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:03.680]  because there were the rubber meets the road they're seeing it all so they hear a show like this
[01:17:04.400 --> 01:17:08.800]  it clicks just like that because they may disagree on this point at that point but at the end of the
[01:17:08.800 --> 01:17:13.680]  day they know they're getting something more sophisticated and closer to reality than you're
[01:17:13.680 --> 01:17:18.960]  getting anywhere else because we really study we really try to know what's happening anybody could
[01:17:18.960 --> 01:17:29.760]  do this okay but you got to do it for 20 years it's the long-term knowledge base that matters and so
[01:17:32.800 --> 01:17:40.080]  i mean i know that the police secret society out in LA listens to the show uh i know um
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:45.120]  um i know that the mason's listen to the show i know
[01:17:48.000 --> 01:17:53.520]  because we know what we're talking about and that's why people want to take us down
[01:17:54.080 --> 01:18:00.720]  it's why so many people don't like us is because we do have the ear of people in major corporations
[01:18:00.720 --> 01:18:04.080]  and people in the government i was at an event
[01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:11.760]  giving a speech saturday kc research and there were i was going i know that guy from tv i know

[01:25:00.960 --> 01:25:09.920]  and preparing for civil war while the communists and the socialist run by a very small select group
[01:25:09.920 --> 01:25:16.720]  of mega capital that's tax exempt are trying to start civil wars in the west especially in the united
[01:25:16.720 --> 01:25:25.040]  states between the police and the public and then they'll use the crisis of the civil war
[01:25:25.040 --> 01:25:32.240]  to bring in total draconian control al qaeda menacing the west is just the pretext to get
[01:25:32.240 --> 01:25:37.200]  the stuff in place for the civil war and we continue to tell you exactly what's going to
[01:25:37.200 --> 01:25:42.720]  transpire just like we said a few years ago then the al qaeda forces will have their name changed
[01:25:43.440 --> 01:25:47.200]  i don't know how we even knew they would do that it just made sense to confuse everybody
[01:25:47.200 --> 01:25:52.400]  and then they would start attacking the west and then that would be used to take our freedoms this
[01:25:52.400 --> 01:25:59.680]  is not rocket science it's just the public's never thought like a macchiaballion manipulator
[01:26:01.600 --> 01:26:04.400]  people that are awake though but it doesn't make sense it's so obvious
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:10.560]  yes that's because you're awake it's like saying to a person who's awake well i couldn't walk right
[01:26:10.560 --> 01:26:17.280]  up and slap you in the face but if somebody's asleep you can if someone's asleep they're asleep
[01:26:18.080 --> 01:26:23.280]  they don't see a brown recluse can line them up on the bed and come over and bite them if i'm awake
[01:26:23.280 --> 01:26:27.520]  and a brown recluse comes walking right over to my hand this is happening before in my house
[01:26:28.320 --> 01:26:32.480]  out in the woods that's a brown recluse that sucker's got a fiddle on its back
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:39.120]  well i'm going to smash it you get a piece of paper hmm look at that kids that's a brown recluse
[01:26:39.120 --> 01:26:42.160]  because i'm awake i'm looking around
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:48.240]  i don't go out to some old farmhouse or something that i hadn't been out in six months
[01:26:48.880 --> 01:26:53.120]  and just climb into a bed that's in there i check in there to see if there's spiders in there
[01:26:53.120 --> 01:26:57.760]  and guess what a lot of times there is so they call that being a conspiracy terrorist
[01:26:57.760 --> 01:27:03.040]  not trusting big government not trusting black uniforms not trusting open surveillance not
[01:27:03.920 --> 01:27:08.480]  that's that that's like going in a farmhouse and not trusting a bed that nobody's been in six months
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:12.000]  or shoes you hadn't put on in a year
[01:27:14.880 --> 01:27:19.600]  i can't tell you how many times there's been a millipede or a spider or a scorpion in my boots
[01:27:21.040 --> 01:27:22.160]  growing up in texas
[01:27:22.160 --> 01:27:27.920]  we tell you i was about four years old and watch one of my buddy's dads
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:35.680]  tim baxter stick his foot in the boot when we got out of the rv in the morning hunting
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:43.280]  and there was a spider and a scorpion in the shoe
[01:27:44.960 --> 01:27:49.840]  and they both bit him he got bit got one out oh my this is terrible put stuff on it stuck his foot
[01:27:49.840 --> 01:27:52.160]  back in and got hit by the wolf spider
[01:27:55.120 --> 01:27:57.280]  i said i'd take calls and i'm digressing into stories
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:03.920]  not trusting a big tyrannical government is like not sticking your hand down rattlesnake holes in
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:11.760]  arizona that's all we're saying here is whoa historically we know what this means we know
[01:28:11.760 --> 01:28:22.560]  where this goes and then billionaires but a hundred millionaires in a leech have been fleeing the west
[01:28:22.560 --> 01:28:32.720]  for about six years and they're just sitting back waiting for it to blow i told the story about
[01:28:32.720 --> 01:28:42.640]  running into john wane's family who were moving out of wemberley about four years ago moving
[01:28:42.640 --> 01:28:50.080]  to costa rica because the new tax laws coming in but more than that the elite have all given the
[01:28:50.080 --> 01:28:56.880]  word that they are going to screw this country over royal and that's some valuable information
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:29:04.480]  i think for all you to have out there remember about two years ago they asked ashton kusher
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:09.360]  or however you say his name what he was doing and he said i'm exercising and training and
[01:29:09.360 --> 01:29:14.800]  preparing for collapse now i don't know if collapse is imminent or whether it's even
[01:29:14.800 --> 01:29:21.280]  inevitable but the preponderance of everything is leaning towards that and the derivatives
[01:29:21.280 --> 01:29:27.920]  and other things are untenable so i don't know where it's all going exactly but it's not good
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:36.560]  but we're not being negative we're admitting the problems that we've got so we can have a soft landing
[01:29:36.560 --> 01:29:44.240]  i'm gonna go right to damien and to steve and to john and mick mick is back from australia

[01:34:31.600 --> 01:34:36.560]  attack america that wasn't hard to predict and no politician will get in trouble i guess when they
[01:34:36.560 --> 01:34:40.800]  come right across the border and do it or fly in no we'll just lose more freedoms and they'll
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:46.560]  they'll call the politicians heroes that funded us isis that's what a zombie population gets i
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:52.800]  guess obama ignores constitution again to launch syria attack with no legal basis paul joseph watson's
[01:34:52.800 --> 01:35:01.680]  article a detailed rt report with video of what happened with the bombing in syria and we're also
[01:35:01.680 --> 01:35:07.840]  going to get into a whole bunch of other stories that have been breaking up there on the site as
[01:35:07.840 --> 01:35:16.400]  well that remind me guys to cover the peter feel a piece from in game that is absolutely
[01:35:17.200 --> 01:35:24.080]  essential to get that done now before i go any further to your phone calls
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:32.400]  i believe in symbiotic relationships i believe in win-win
[01:35:32.400 --> 01:35:42.000]  what's that a rhythmic song some of them want to use you some of them want to be used by you
[01:35:42.640 --> 01:35:52.560]  well no not me i like to give pleasure and to receive pleasure i like to give hospitality
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:59.200]  and receive hospitality i like to give knowledge i like to receive knowledge that's how the universe
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:05.440]  is supposed to work and i always thought everybody else was like me no a lot of people not a majority
[01:36:05.440 --> 01:36:12.480]  but a large minority think it's cool to cheat people and cool to get ahead running scamps
[01:36:12.480 --> 01:36:18.400]  long term that doesn't ever work plus it's not fulfilling my dad would always tell me son
[01:36:18.400 --> 01:36:22.400]  there are people that would rather kill you for a dollar than make a million dollars with you
[01:36:22.400 --> 01:36:25.760]  there are people that would rather steal a dollar from you than make a thousand dollars with you
[01:36:25.760 --> 01:36:32.800]  and i'd say really now a lot of it is because they never had success doing things the honorable way
[01:36:32.800 --> 01:36:39.120]  so they don't believe it exists they believe dishonor and treachery uh is the ether in which
[01:36:39.120 --> 01:36:46.320]  they have success is the atmosphere in which they live is the sustenance of their very being
[01:36:48.000 --> 01:36:54.160]  but when i promote something it's not just because it brings money in here and funds my operation
[01:36:54.160 --> 01:37:00.880]  which is the key to what i want to do i want to wake people up i want to expose tyranny i want
[01:37:00.880 --> 01:37:04.800]  people to know that the vaccines don't protect them most of the time and are filled with all
[01:37:04.800 --> 01:37:09.280]  sorts of horrible stuff and have horrible side effects and in many cases things are added on
[01:37:09.280 --> 01:37:14.000]  purpose to reduce your fertility or give you cancer down the road and that's all been declassified
[01:37:14.000 --> 01:37:22.320]  so for heaven's sakes please look it up but in a win win i want to but see a win win
[01:37:22.320 --> 01:37:29.520]  doesn't just do the right thing morally it also ends up making you more money because people then
[01:37:29.520 --> 01:37:36.080]  come back and buy more products from you because they're the best it's like the ford raptor came
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:42.400]  out six years ago won all these big desert sahara races and so then everybody wanted them they
[01:37:42.400 --> 01:37:47.600]  started becoming commercially available five years ago i got one almost three years ago and now
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:55.600]  they're everywhere because they were the best truck now chevy's coming out with one the recon
[01:37:55.600 --> 01:38:03.200]  their single be even better for off-road and stuff see produce quality produce the best
[01:38:03.200 --> 01:38:09.600]  then everyone will want it if it's affordable especially like a souped up ford f-150 that's
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:17.360]  all it is it's great they'll pull a boat up a mountain it's great people drive up incredible
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:22.320]  inclines and believe me i mean i wrote my dab and land cruisers and stuff it's a map and jeeps
[01:38:22.320 --> 01:38:27.440]  you name it raptor is amazing but i'm not doing a ford plug here that they're not a sponsor
[01:38:27.440 --> 01:38:34.240]  though they should be the products so good they don't need to even advertise and see
[01:38:38.160 --> 01:38:43.040]  that's the same thing i went to experts top formulators and i said i want the
[01:38:43.040 --> 01:38:49.920]  the best system to flush out the guts i want the best iodine i can't take this other stuff
[01:38:50.480 --> 01:38:57.040]  i want the best male and female vitality cold press concentrated the strongest thing out there
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:39:01.120]  that's the safest that doesn't mimic testosterone but it gets the body to release it
[01:39:03.760 --> 01:39:10.480]  i want the best and we go to these major even respected big you know formulators
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:14.960]  and companies that are out there and we say to them yeah we're going to put this much
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:18.880]  ingredients in these eye pills and they go really that's about three times what anybody else has
[01:39:18.880 --> 01:39:24.960]  ever done you know it's an expensive formula that costs you six dollars a bottle and you
[01:39:24.960 --> 01:39:29.520]  sell it for 30 you know you're going to spend 14 dollars a bottle and sell it for 30 okay
[01:39:30.320 --> 01:39:35.920]  that's new in the industry oh you're going to spend 17 18 dollars on a bottle of something
[01:39:35.920 --> 01:39:40.480]  and sell it for 40 that's new you're going to spend 60 something dollars on something and sell
[01:39:40.480 --> 01:39:48.160]  it for 130 that's new see that's shaking up the entire nutraceutical system i can't even believe
[01:39:48.160 --> 01:39:53.360]  just from a just from a business standpoint you'd want to sell lower the highest quality to dominate
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:58.720]  the market but just my instinct to want to give people a good deal while also funding our operation
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:04.480]  it has a decent markup in there we're free market it's just amazing how the average person has no
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:09.920]  business sense nothing even business people it's amazing and so this isn't even a plug for products
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:16.960]  here so much as it is about my philosophy i love telling people the truth i love trying to figure
[01:40:16.960 --> 01:40:24.880]  out what's really going on i love being accurate i love having freedom and that's what i want back

[01:41:42.560 --> 01:41:53.280]  the answer to 1984 is 1776 it means the 1984 dystopia the answer to it is 1776 what's hard to
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:42:02.640]  understand about that we got little minute men card decals little happy smiley face patriot with a
[01:42:02.640 --> 01:42:07.040]  with a rifle you know i saw this morning driving into work not one not two but three and i haven't
[01:42:07.040 --> 01:42:13.840]  seen this in a while pick up trucks with with rifles one was a shotgun one was an ar-15 one was
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:22.880]  a deer rifle like remington 700 synthetic black stock driving down mopec and i thought that was
[01:42:22.880 --> 01:42:28.160]  just beautiful because just 20 30 years ago you saw that everywhere but people would call the cops
[01:42:28.160 --> 01:42:32.240]  so so the cops would come and pull you over and harass you so you wouldn't but now because of open
[01:42:32.240 --> 01:42:36.800]  carry they're trying to act like guns are illegal create that perception so they can then ban them
[01:42:36.800 --> 01:42:42.720]  no we're openly marching to the alamo when the police say they'll arrest us when their laws
[01:42:42.720 --> 01:42:46.880]  and violations state law and they back down because they knew what they were doing was wrong
[01:42:46.880 --> 01:42:51.840]  that was a civil rights march for everybody not to hate the police they're implementing a criminal
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:56.240]  city council's operation in the deep in the heart of texas and we're not putting up with it
[01:42:57.760 --> 01:42:59.600]  and they had women all over the state of texas
[01:42:59.600 --> 01:43:05.040]  i saw it in the paper march yesterday
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:16.480]  i saw that all over the state of texas houston san tony and amen women marched with their guns
[01:43:16.480 --> 01:43:21.520]  i'm telling you it's beautiful all right let's go to your phone calls damien in arizona thanks for
[01:43:21.520 --> 01:43:30.000]  holding now anyone else i'd like to address the whole isis and uh caliphate gang in terms of uh
[01:43:30.000 --> 01:43:35.520]  jill farrah of world met daily um you know how they always said uh terrorism is a tactic and you
[01:43:35.520 --> 01:43:42.000]  can't beat a a verb or no matter whatever so now i mean conveniently they named it a state so it's
[01:43:42.000 --> 01:43:47.360]  a terrorist state so now they actually have a geopolitical reason to specifically attack it
[01:43:47.360 --> 01:43:54.880]  as a physical entity i think it's a little bit of a coup in their pr department and then they can
[01:43:56.080 --> 01:43:58.640]  say that the islamic state has gone to any country they want to attack
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:05.280]  exactly so now it's an actual it's a literal boogeyman before you know terrorist terrorism is
[01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:10.480]  like you know some nebulous arbitrary thing now it's a physical thing but i'd like to address
[01:44:10.480 --> 01:44:16.320]  jill farrah i i love the site on a lot of this stuff but your initial instinct i believe is right
[01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:22.480]  there's a reason why i always end up coming back to your site because there are people who specialize
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:28.480]  in you know munisha of like domestic or foreign issues but you do a very good meta and partly as
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:32.560]  much as i love is uh geopolitically i can get the guy when he comes back and i'm he's you know
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:37.040]  frankly economy i mean west phaser he's a hamilton you know american school specifically but he's a
[01:44:37.040 --> 01:44:41.280]  you know he still likes to say but when he comes to joe farrah i love all this stuff in terms of
[01:44:41.280 --> 01:44:46.560]  domestic stuff but this whole caliphate thing is really overblown because you know the new world
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:53.040]  order uses this as a tool so just because oh absolutely they have wound up the caliphate
[01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:58.960]  i'm just saying it was world net daily that i saw first talking about it but the thing is i think
[01:44:58.960 --> 01:45:04.400]  we're on that daily date joseph farrah i love the guy but he's he's a he's a lebanese syrian
[01:45:05.040 --> 01:45:09.920]  christian um i i live and i work in lebanon for a little bit so i'm kind of familiar with the
[01:45:09.920 --> 01:45:16.080]  uh the marina christian traditions and i am also aware with american lebanese christian
[01:45:16.080 --> 01:45:21.920]  communities view of that entire world the whole caliphate thing this is a problem i mean and a
[01:45:21.920 --> 01:45:26.080]  lot of the guys on the world net daily side they're always about oh they're using it it's all about
[01:45:26.080 --> 01:45:30.880]  communisms all about socialism and you who study all this stuff with the whole new world you
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:36.640]  understand the meta that they only use that as a tool so just because ices as cia you know or new
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:42.080]  world order you know intel creation paint the entire you know mat with their photo i mean with
[01:45:42.080 --> 01:45:46.240]  their flag on it doesn't make it so you know i mean just because they say oh yeah we're going to
[01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:52.560]  take hold the entire world ooh buga buga you know i mean i agree with you the narrative here and what's
[01:45:52.560 --> 01:45:59.600]  important to understand is the the truth narrative versus their fraud narrative their deception narrative
[01:45:59.600 --> 01:46:04.560]  is that now their narrative is wearing thin and people are going wait a minute we're going to
[01:46:04.560 --> 01:46:12.320]  arm ices to then bomb ices and more and more prominent people are speaking out against that i
[01:46:12.320 --> 01:46:20.560]  appreciate your call i'm going to make an australia here in just a moment but if you look at what
[01:46:20.560 --> 01:46:27.440]  they're doing in the middle east notice that egypt has been quietly for the last few months
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:37.600]  been bombing al-qaeda ices strongholds in libya and our government has been trying to overthrow
[01:46:37.600 --> 01:46:44.000]  that government because it's secular they got rid of the dictator but it's still the military and
[01:46:44.000 --> 01:46:48.480]  i'm not defending a military coup but strongmen is all that tend to work in the middle east these
[01:46:48.480 --> 01:46:54.400]  days and the military doesn't let them chop the christians heads off and you can go be a tourist
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:59.360]  there and you can have a job there and have some decent freedom there compared to being under
[01:46:59.360 --> 01:47:06.160]  islamic state light which is the muslim brotherhood and so i've just learned the players and what's
[01:47:06.160 --> 01:47:11.280]  happening here show you've got egypt bombing al-qaeda and you've got syria bombing al-qaeda and
[01:47:11.280 --> 01:47:18.400]  then israel shoots down today the syrian fighter bomber that was bombing al-qaeda
[01:47:18.400 --> 01:47:28.240]  and then there are folks out there that literally worship israel and whatever the politician running
[01:47:28.240 --> 01:47:33.280]  israel says they would you know decry some jew in israel that didn't totally agree with the prime
[01:47:33.280 --> 01:47:38.640]  minister over there or their leaders and it just becomes really one dimensional and mindless
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:43.520]  when i'm like hey israel shouldn't be supporting isis neither should turkey neither
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:48.480]  should england either should be the us it's like why don't you like israel uh i i'm allowed to have
[01:47:48.480 --> 01:47:52.400]  my opinion and and and say that i don't think funding al-qaeda is good
[01:47:57.920 --> 01:48:03.040]  you've got egypt and the united arab emirants that are bombing and and and then you've got
[01:48:03.680 --> 01:48:08.320]  other countries that aren't liking it in the area i mean i think egypt's doing the right thing
[01:48:08.320 --> 01:48:12.240]  bombing these people and they're not starting to fight they know this group's already been attacking
[01:48:12.240 --> 01:48:17.520]  them inside egypt uh let's go to uh mick mick i forgot you were there again from australia i
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:22.160]  appreciate you trying to get back in and get on air uh so from australia you're on the air go ahead
[01:48:23.520 --> 01:48:32.400]  get a alex hey buddy um i i want to talk about um well the effect of isis um being such a
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:41.200]  uh a pawn used by governments uh in australia we've had um our prime minister make some rather um
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:51.920]  provocative and uh yeah very scary remarks in the last couple of days yes to the effect of
[01:48:51.920 --> 01:48:57.440]  regrettably for some time the delicate balance between freedom and security may have to shift
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:06.720]  i mean that sounds to me uh a la um nodule for range is which has come up just recently as well so
[01:49:08.160 --> 01:49:16.640]  but they're they're looking at um changing our laws basically to these new anti-terror laws or
[01:49:16.640 --> 01:49:22.960]  legislations as if they haven't already taken up your liberties in australia and and i too am
[01:49:22.960 --> 01:49:30.160]  deeply concerned about the the liberty leader of europe nizal farage coming out and saying i'm sad to
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:34.800]  say we're going to give up liberty for security the opposite of benjamin franklin and then now
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:40.960]  your leaders are saying that uh they've been told get in line and go along with this win our own
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:47.920]  governments literally help create these groups it's it's just sickening exactly alex it's just
[01:49:47.920 --> 01:49:58.880]  ridiculous you know who's not saying it ran paul no ran paul no ran paul's um i think he's an
[01:49:58.880 --> 01:50:04.880]  excellent statement well you can you can score political points like farage is done and like
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:08.640]  your leader's done and you know i like some of the stuff your new leader's doing you know getting
[01:50:08.640 --> 01:50:14.320]  rid of carbon taxes and stuff but it's easy political points to score to say yeah we're

[01:55:08.400 --> 01:55:15.760]  guest joins us to joe big special report africa smoke screen so this and more today right now
[01:55:15.760 --> 01:55:22.560]  uh let's go to steve in virginia steve thanks for holding you're on the air thank you alex i've
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:29.120]  been listening to you via shortwave radio for many many years and i thought today i would comment on
[01:55:29.120 --> 01:55:40.720]  the syrian situation when president obama ordered air strikes on syrian soil unilaterally declared
[01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:47.840]  war against syria which is a direct violation of the war powers act and this is a high crime
[01:55:48.400 --> 01:55:53.760]  in which congress should vote to impeach him and so should the senate and further i think they
[01:55:53.760 --> 01:56:00.960]  should censor him so that the american people will no longer hear a chicago use salesman oral
[01:56:00.960 --> 01:56:08.320]  masturbator it's time stuff has got a goal it's he's doing anything he wants and he can do it
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:13.360]  with fiat right he's already legalized the illegals by fiat and then said oh but he hasn't
[01:56:13.360 --> 01:56:18.960]  he's already bringing in the carbon taxes without congressional approval uh and paul watson wrote the
[01:56:18.960 --> 01:56:23.760]  article this morning it's clear in the constitution and we quoted obama ignores congress again to
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:29.920]  launch syria attack with no legal basis president commits impeachable offense and he's attacking a
[01:56:29.920 --> 01:56:36.240]  sovereign country claiming he's attacking a group that's attacking that country and saying that if
[01:56:36.240 --> 01:56:43.600]  syria shoots back he'll bomb them i mean it is just so wild and if he gets away with it
[01:56:44.560 --> 01:56:50.480]  he'll do more in fact congressman uh justin amash is quoted in there saying it's irresponsible
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:57.120]  and immoral that instead of debating and voting on war congressional leaders chose to recess congress
[01:56:57.120 --> 01:57:02.320]  for nearly two months uh yeah they advocated their responsibility but that that's a great point
[01:57:02.320 --> 01:57:08.400]  we just sit here watching the imperial presidency even jonathan turley who's a big liberal says
[01:57:08.400 --> 01:57:13.840]  obama has done about three times what bush did unconstitutional and bush broke records because
[01:57:13.840 --> 01:57:19.680]  the power structure is sick of the constitution it wants to do whatever it wants to go ahead
[01:57:20.880 --> 01:57:27.200]  yeah like i say it's government out of control and you know this ish's situation is very much
[01:57:27.200 --> 01:57:34.000]  similar to uh what fabius did against Hannibal they used this asymmetrical warfare and the
[01:57:34.000 --> 01:57:39.360]  griller tactics and they eventually wore down a Hannibal and it's the same thing that the
[01:57:39.360 --> 01:57:46.720]  fabian socialists do here in this country too it's uh and the only way you can defeat asymmetrical
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:54.240]  warfare is with asymmetrical warfare and the thing of it is i just wonder how many arab americans are
[01:57:54.240 --> 01:58:00.400]  in our armed forces i think they should be used for this gorilla asymmetrical warfare
[01:58:00.400 --> 01:58:06.080]  to defeat pices well obviously but they're not going to let them do that because it's all a
[01:58:06.080 --> 01:58:11.200]  fake war on isis a smokescreen to give them weapons to take out a sod they're gonna blow up a few
[01:58:11.200 --> 01:58:17.280]  tanks here a few armored vehicles there a few toilet trucks here it's just total mind war against us
[01:58:17.840 --> 01:58:23.520]  and it's so sophisticated because it's so over the top sometimes the simplest lie is the best
[01:58:23.520 --> 01:58:27.440]  you just repeat it long enough as hitler said or those of gerbils actually said at the big lie
[01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:32.000]  speech that was his minister of propaganda all right third hour ladies and gentlemen straight

[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:39.200]  start uh i i was uncertain about the situation in syria uh until i've heard from a uh core war
[02:01:39.200 --> 02:01:44.960]  correspondent who said that the christians were actively backing the syrian government and i said
[02:01:44.960 --> 02:01:50.720]  wow you know these these people only could find some kind of uh protection and justice under a
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:56.240]  secular government which uh unfortunately our president is trying to destroy all the secular
[02:01:56.240 --> 02:02:03.440]  governments in in the middle east starting with with libya and then the um egypt egypt and now
[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:11.280]  and now syria and and replace those with the the fundamentalist radical uh murdering type
[02:02:12.640 --> 02:02:18.960]  people that are running this they really are crazed eyed head shoppers yeah i i just don't
[02:02:18.960 --> 02:02:23.760]  understand and now we're going to watch continue to give arms to the to the rebels in this in the
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:29.200]  syria conflict you know what we should be doing is back out of way and start arming the christians
[02:02:29.200 --> 02:02:36.080]  in the middle east and let them agree we should arm whoever is being attacked and whoever the underdog
[02:02:36.080 --> 02:02:42.000]  is then that's what america used to do i mean it is so immoral to be in there trying to overthrow
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:48.400]  Assad when he had been trying to democratize and work with us and i'm not saying he's an angel he
[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:54.480]  was a good guy compared to qaddafi and then qaddafi was a good guy compared to al qaeda i mean why would
[02:02:54.480 --> 02:03:00.560]  our government try to overthrow egypt too why why do they want to put these people in charge yeah
[02:03:00.560 --> 02:03:04.880]  well you know life is cheap in the middle east you can have somebody kill for two hundred dollars
[02:03:04.880 --> 02:03:11.040]  you can buy somebody's uh teenage daughter for five hundred so uh these people live on a whole
[02:03:11.040 --> 02:03:16.640]  different uh a paradigm than we do you know they just don't respect life in the middle east for
[02:03:16.640 --> 02:03:24.800]  the most part uh also uh i'm reading a book currently by uh um oh shoot what's his name
[02:03:25.360 --> 02:03:33.920]  the the um minnesota x governor you know yeah ventura what ventura yeah jesse ventura uh american
[02:03:33.920 --> 02:03:41.200]  uh conspiracies and it's absolutely got my hair standing on in in my back back in my head because
[02:03:41.200 --> 02:03:49.920]  uh the cia ever since its creation has been involved within this country in numerous conspiracies
[02:03:50.560 --> 02:03:56.480]  the jfk assassination the martin luther king assassination the marcon act a malcolm x fascination
[02:03:57.040 --> 02:04:04.800]  any number of other activities that are nesperius that are against the law the the cia's got got
[02:04:04.800 --> 02:04:09.600]  blood on their hands all the way up to the elbows on no that's right and then they tried to assassinate
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:15.920]  ventura's character with the made up chris kyle thing that he said that uh ventura was glad seals
[02:04:15.920 --> 02:04:20.240]  died and knocked him out so ventura soon even said where's your witnesses and he didn't have any
[02:04:20.240 --> 02:04:26.480]  and he lost the jury trial and then people said oh how dare you sue a uh you know a widow because
[02:04:26.480 --> 02:04:33.520]  kyle got killed it was an insurance policy with news corps i mean what was ventura supposed to do
[02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:41.360]  he didn't do that that was a lie and so by the way jesse was on about a month ago and
[02:04:41.360 --> 02:04:44.480]  he said he wanted to come back on in september i forgot to get him back on we'll see we can still

[02:08:46.560 --> 02:08:51.360]  shenner that's like a locked up apartment complex with a bunch of drug addicts and other people
[02:08:52.000 --> 02:08:56.960]  that sounds worse than prison in some ways man i've gone and done volunteer work at some of
[02:08:56.960 --> 02:09:04.160]  those places and it's it's bad as in the criminals can come and go uh 30 000 fine and therapeutic
[02:09:04.800 --> 02:09:11.520]  counseling brainwashing about how evil it was that he got four of his friends together to give
[02:09:11.520 --> 02:09:20.240]  money to a senate candidate that he'd been friends with in college that's like you take one sip of
[02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:26.320]  beer and they pull you over and find you a hundred thousand dollars or lock you up in prison and then
[02:09:27.280 --> 02:09:33.840]  the democrats get caught with a blood alcohol 15 times the legal limit that'll kill most people
[02:09:33.840 --> 02:09:39.280]  with 18 bottles of jack daniel spilt all over the vehicle just rolling around vomiting everywhere
[02:09:39.280 --> 02:09:47.360]  or and they don't get in trouble like rosemary lemburg the da here in travis county
[02:09:51.440 --> 02:09:58.400]  it's just unbelievable how this happened and if they did this to michael more who i don't even
[02:09:58.400 --> 02:10:06.400]  politically like i would be against it and worried i mean they are politically looking for any petty
[02:10:06.400 --> 02:10:12.640]  thing with this justice department to go after people and to choose a one had pled guilty and
[02:10:12.640 --> 02:10:18.560]  said yeah i guess i should have done this better i should have formed a political pack and got my
[02:10:18.560 --> 02:10:27.040]  friends to give but it was like 30 000 dollars look at the irs going after the tea party all of it
[02:10:27.760 --> 02:10:33.040]  and then i said me see cheerleys it says yeah they're racist shut them down it's so creepy
[02:10:33.040 --> 02:10:39.200]  therapeutic counseling that's like whenever they tried to put
[02:10:41.680 --> 02:10:47.680]  tom delay in jail in texas for a legal pack took him five years to beat it but
[02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:54.000]  he beat it it was all fake i'm not even defending tom delay a mainline republican warmonger
[02:10:54.000 --> 02:11:05.520]  globalist but he's not anti-gun he wasn't pro-abortion so he was seen as an enemy by these people
[02:11:07.360 --> 02:11:15.200]  and so that is all about a chilling effect tom delay's conviction overturned by texas court
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:20.160]  you know what it sure kicked him out of congress see they don't want you to make a libertarian
[02:11:20.160 --> 02:11:24.400]  film or write a book they don't want you to have a conservative pack to get people elected to congress
[02:11:24.400 --> 02:11:29.600]  they're going to come after you and they're going to get a grand jury that would indict a ham sandwich
[02:11:29.600 --> 02:11:35.280]  to do it they'll do whatever dirty trick they need to they are a clear and present danger look at this
[02:11:35.280 --> 02:11:41.520]  article morocco obama on isis combat this is not america's fight alone they got the french
[02:11:41.520 --> 02:11:46.160]  and others involved just randomly by bombing a few pieces of equipment it's fake and then quote
[02:11:46.160 --> 02:11:53.120]  giving 500 million to the good rebels that is al qaeda and john bainer the guy that's for open
[02:11:53.120 --> 02:12:02.480]  borders and obama care he funded that last week says that isis or isle is a direct threat to the
[02:12:02.480 --> 02:12:07.040]  safety of the united states and our allies republican house speaker john boner said
[02:12:07.040 --> 02:12:11.760]  in a statement after obama's tuesday morning remarks on the situation quote i support the
[02:12:11.760 --> 02:12:16.400]  airstrikes launched by president understanding this is just one part one step in what must be
[02:12:16.400 --> 02:12:21.680]  a larger effort destroy and defeat this terrorist organization i wish our men and women in uniform
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:27.600]  godspeed as they carry out this fight you mean piloting the drones and of course the white house
[02:12:27.600 --> 02:12:33.280]  picks the targets did you hear that last week we will work with you obama we will attack you
[02:12:33.280 --> 02:12:38.240]  when you need it so you can take your liberties but you will never strike any of our real people
[02:12:38.240 --> 02:12:43.600]  if we may put some units of idiots out from the desert pop and let you know where they be
[02:12:44.160 --> 02:12:48.480]  but to this preference you not even kill them and i watched all these videos there'll be no one
[02:12:48.480 --> 02:12:53.040]  around the vehicles no heat signatures it looked like some old toyota truck and they're like yeah
[02:12:53.040 --> 02:13:02.000]  we're bombing them fake fake fake fake fake on record that's what's crazy we're going to give them
[02:13:02.000 --> 02:13:07.360]  500 million dollars on top of the billions because there's a good rebels there are no good
[02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:12.640]  rebels the pentagon as he said that the pentagon doesn't like this general dimsy was hopping mad
[02:13:12.640 --> 02:13:18.560]  in there last week and they're like nobody there's nowhere about none of our allies giving weapons
[02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:26.480]  right general he goes no our allies do give them weapons our weapons we give weapons of
[02:13:26.480 --> 02:13:35.200]  Saudi Arabia they give it to him totally staged and are we sophisticated enough to get it i don't
[02:13:35.200 --> 02:13:41.760]  know i don't know the answer to this intimidation the answer to this chilling effect the answer
[02:13:43.200 --> 02:13:48.400]  to the nsa with a fine-tooth comb going over everything anybody who's got an american flag
[02:13:48.400 --> 02:13:53.520]  in their yards doing literally that's what they say the enemy veterans being harassed conservatives
[02:13:54.320 --> 02:14:01.200]  gun owners pro-life earth christians the answer to their conquest of our free speech is to double
[02:14:01.200 --> 02:14:05.360]  down and become even more aggressive and to speak out and not with the chilling effect work because
[02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:13.360]  of the chilling effect they're trying to push works it's all over it's that simple and the good
[02:14:13.360 --> 02:14:19.120]  news is the chilling effect has not been working every metric shows that the democrats have about
[02:14:19.120 --> 02:14:25.200]  a 25 approval rating congress has a seven percent overall obama's got like a 30 they're all just a
[02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:32.160]  big giant joke and people see through it and it's not working besides we don't need the cowards that
[02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:36.960]  get scared of this and think climbing under a rock's gonna keep them safe the real men start
[02:14:36.960 --> 02:14:42.480]  standing up the real women start standing up when the real tyranny manifests itself people aren't
[02:14:42.480 --> 02:14:47.440]  really scared they've been lazy they haven't been sure now that it's gotten so obvious
[02:14:48.640 --> 02:14:54.240]  how about a clear and present danger our government banner boner this is real name why not just
[02:14:54.240 --> 02:15:00.880]  pronounce it be like if i said my name is not jones it is jonan's or something i was literally
[02:15:01.680 --> 02:15:05.520]  he had a whole campaign when he first ran for congress where they would stay on tv out of
[02:15:05.520 --> 02:15:13.760]  find the clips when he goes it's not it's not boner it's bainer they would have this these radio
[02:15:13.760 --> 02:15:18.640]  ads too that's what i saw was a radio ad put to youtube years ago but i mean be be proud of your
[02:15:18.640 --> 02:15:31.360]  german name bro it just means like boner but it's boner now continuing here
[02:15:33.120 --> 02:15:38.800]  the real elite are just people like us on average most of them aren't total criminals but they're
[02:15:38.800 --> 02:15:43.760]  part of the criminal combine because they've got to work with it just to get along and one of those
[02:15:43.760 --> 02:15:48.640]  is peter thiel who helped create a lot of the revolutionary things we see out there today
[02:15:48.640 --> 02:15:55.680]  in online commerce paypal the billionaire tech entrepreneur is on a mission to cheat death and
[02:15:55.680 --> 02:16:00.080]  democrats attack him a lot and say he's the only example of a conspiracy so they can throw it back
[02:16:00.080 --> 02:16:04.240]  on libertarians but he does give money to pro-gun groups and he does give money to libertarian groups
[02:16:04.240 --> 02:16:11.120]  and people like rand paul he also goes to bill deberg but the co-founder of paypal and likely
[02:16:11.120 --> 02:16:15.920]  the most successful venture capitalist in silicon valley is on a mission to change the world through
[02:16:15.920 --> 02:16:22.080]  technology and find a cure for death and then the telegraph describes their hour-long interview
[02:16:22.080 --> 02:16:26.160]  with him where he talks about transcendence and humans merging with machines you ought to go read
[02:16:26.160 --> 02:16:33.680]  the article now i quoted people like feel curves well and others but went deep into the documents
[02:16:33.680 --> 02:16:39.840]  in my seminal film endgame blueprint for global enslavement available free online by the dvd as
[02:16:39.840 --> 02:16:44.560]  well and then for store.com we won't have it hard copied and this is just a small part of the film
[02:16:44.560 --> 02:16:49.440]  where we get into this but when you understand this you understand how the entire game plan
[02:16:49.440 --> 02:16:55.200]  operates and how it really works that's why they want world government that's why they want to shut
[02:16:55.200 --> 02:17:00.560]  down individual liberty is so the elite has access to all this without you sharing it because if the
[02:17:00.560 --> 02:17:05.280]  general public ever gets all this it'll blast all their monopolies so they want to keep their
[02:17:05.280 --> 02:17:12.080]  monopolies in place while being able to have a breakaway civilization i'm gonna skip this
[02:17:12.080 --> 02:17:17.200]  network break while they have a breakaway civilization that we're not even aware of
[02:17:17.200 --> 02:17:23.200]  that hides behind corporate slash national slash global security and that's their words not mine
[02:17:23.200 --> 02:17:30.800]  well here's the deal i'm not going to go join them and work with them hoping that i get entree
[02:17:30.800 --> 02:17:38.480]  into this system that's bad mojo bad karma i'm not a buddhist but you know the term or hindu
[02:17:39.120 --> 02:17:47.040]  we call it report you so we're christians my god fearing antennae go bang they don't like it
[02:17:47.040 --> 02:17:52.640]  when i think about joining with the sauron so that i supposedly get some power and i can live
[02:17:52.640 --> 02:17:59.120]  longer my kids can't know the answer is expose the rabbit trick expose the whole paradigm just
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:04.800]  as be done may the heavens fall and let people know the real inequity is in technology and
[02:18:04.800 --> 02:18:12.320]  information and that a superclass is formed and is preparing to literally escape to an elysium
[02:18:12.320 --> 02:18:20.000]  type system what they have helped create so i want to force them to be culpable i want to force
[02:18:20.000 --> 02:18:25.200]  them to be in the crosshairs politically i want to force them to understand the public knows the
[02:18:25.200 --> 02:18:31.040]  secret the public knows the trick the public knows the game so they can't get away with it so they
[02:18:31.040 --> 02:18:37.760]  reverse this plan of global depopulation and exterminism let the clean technologies come out
[02:18:37.760 --> 02:18:42.880]  let the real education systems come out that can empower humanity and stop trying to dumb humanity
[02:18:42.880 --> 02:18:51.200]  down so that they can continue to be the elite if they will just share the technology and the
[02:18:51.200 --> 02:18:56.240]  information and not try to exterminate everybody and there are enough good members of the elite
[02:18:56.240 --> 02:19:00.160]  that are already guilty about what they've done and already know it's immoral and already don't trust
[02:19:00.160 --> 02:19:04.400]  the technocrats above them and no they're going to end up getting cheated as well who want the same
[02:19:04.400 --> 02:19:12.720]  thing so we'll only corner them if we say no quarter if we say no quarter we're going to come
[02:19:12.720 --> 02:19:16.240]  for you you're going to be tried you're going to go to prison they'll fight to the end might blow
[02:19:16.240 --> 02:19:21.520]  the earth up doing it if we have a velvet revolution of understanding and i don't want to use the word
[02:19:21.520 --> 02:19:26.960]  seduce because that has wicked connotations but talk to the elite and talk to their subordinates
[02:19:26.960 --> 02:19:31.520]  and really have a serious discussion with them we've got a chance to have a lot of them defect back
[02:19:31.520 --> 02:19:36.960]  to sanity and have a real debate about all this and try to fix it but i got to get the public
[02:19:36.960 --> 02:19:41.280]  first to want to have a real debate about all this i mean you got to decide that fantasy football
[02:19:41.280 --> 02:19:47.360]  is not the only thing in the universe you've got to decide that you know what alex jones knows what
[02:19:47.360 --> 02:19:52.720]  he's talking about because when i came out and put this film out the system got really upset
[02:19:55.280 --> 02:19:59.040]  because it really told their whole game plan and now other people could know their game plan
[02:20:01.840 --> 02:20:05.200]  we have a whole online bibliography what is the end game dot com i haven't looked at that site
[02:20:05.200 --> 02:20:10.240]  in years i even still up what is the end game dot com every every second of that film has an online
[02:20:10.240 --> 02:20:16.400]  bibliography showing the proof showing the news clipping showing the documentation and they said
[02:20:16.400 --> 02:20:23.040]  jones is crazy he believes they want to create a world government for life extension uh-huh merge
[02:20:23.040 --> 02:20:29.280]  with machines and exterminate the the the vast majority of the population well that's what
[02:20:30.480 --> 02:20:38.320]  the plan is and bill joy wrote about it and warned people 14 years ago in his uh in wired magazine
[02:20:38.320 --> 02:20:43.920]  he said i want you on a meeting with 200 top tech owners and the whole discussion was that we
[02:20:43.920 --> 02:20:49.040]  just kill everybody now or let them play video games and the answer was it's immoral to let them
[02:20:49.040 --> 02:20:55.200]  just play video games we're going to drop the hammer you see the robots getting ready to replace
[02:20:55.200 --> 02:20:59.920]  you you see the paramilitary police getting ready that's in the first phase to make sure you don't
[02:20:59.920 --> 02:21:05.520]  try to squirm then they'll be dealt with later a lot of folks say hey we know this is coming you
[02:21:05.520 --> 02:21:10.160]  can't stop it i'm gonna try to have a good time while this all happens well i'd go buy prison
[02:21:10.160 --> 02:21:15.920]  stock and i'd go buy robot stock and i'd go i would endorse lucifer on air about was you out
[02:21:15.920 --> 02:21:21.200]  there folks if you want to sell out and just accept all this and throw yourself at the feet of the
[02:21:21.200 --> 02:21:27.120]  world system you will be destroyed you'll lose your soul in the process but hey does that really
[02:21:27.120 --> 02:21:32.800]  matter if there's a free iphone implant or something in it maybe that's the way to go okay but don't
[02:21:32.800 --> 02:21:37.840]  cop out and be a coward and point your finger at me and say that's the nut that's the coop that's
[02:21:37.840 --> 02:21:44.000]  the crazy guy you bet i've yelled and screamed to get your attention it's frustration three four
[02:21:44.000 --> 02:21:52.640]  hours a day on air i'm sick of it i know it's real believe me it ain't fun dealing with these people
[02:21:52.640 --> 02:21:57.760]  and their mind games and their dirty tricks and all the rest of it and and look i don't even hate
[02:21:57.760 --> 02:22:04.320]  their minions they're just mindless little programmed dummies who who are like children
[02:22:04.320 --> 02:22:07.280]  forgive them father they know not what they do to quote christ
[02:22:09.280 --> 02:22:12.320]  let me tell you something you sell out to this you sold yourself out
[02:22:15.120 --> 02:22:20.080]  and people better make a decision which side they're on now because notice it's getting clear
[02:22:20.080 --> 02:22:25.680]  everything's getting very clear that's what god always does historically before a world is judged
[02:22:25.680 --> 02:22:31.920]  before a nation before a region before a people before a culture before a city before a family
[02:22:31.920 --> 02:22:40.400]  before a man before a woman before a child is judged it all is manifest and shown to be clear
[02:22:40.400 --> 02:22:47.760]  so you don't have any denial and god will show you again and again and again and then finally the
[02:22:47.760 --> 02:22:53.040]  hammer will drop and all the begging and all the pleading and all the screaming and all the crying
[02:22:53.040 --> 02:22:58.320]  because you have no memory of it the germans have a memory they don't like these wars 20 million dead
[02:22:58.320 --> 02:23:05.520]  germans 20 million same number dead russians think they like war we only lost 400 000 people
[02:23:05.520 --> 02:23:11.760]  in world war two we don't have a real memory of it putin talked about his speech he said we
[02:23:11.760 --> 02:23:17.040]  have nuclear weapons a month ago he said russians have a memory he said a racial memory of being
[02:23:17.040 --> 02:23:23.920]  invaded and attacked over and over again over and over again i just bought a polline and hitler
[02:23:26.080 --> 02:23:32.000]  and see americans don't really have that racial memory we've been given the false racial memory
[02:23:32.000 --> 02:23:42.640]  with sages like mr madow and that other guy uh the reverend sharpton up there with fifth grade
[02:23:42.640 --> 02:23:48.240]  level race baiting divide and conquer i mean those people all know what they're doing get that straight
[02:23:48.880 --> 02:23:55.040]  they're up there soullessly reading off teleprompters trying to screw america up i mean can you imagine
[02:23:56.080 --> 02:24:00.640]  you could put a gun to my head and say be like rachel madow you're dead well go ahead pull the trigger
[02:24:04.560 --> 02:24:05.680]  i'm not selling out
[02:24:05.680 --> 02:24:11.840]  no and it's not a hard decision
[02:24:15.840 --> 02:24:20.000]  there's no coming back from this ladies and gentlemen let's go to this clip from endgame here it is
[02:24:21.840 --> 02:24:28.960]  eugenics dominated the 20th century its ruthless spirit has now metastasized into the fields of
[02:24:28.960 --> 02:24:36.400]  genetics nanotech and robotics but that's not surprising from their inception all three disciplines
[02:24:36.400 --> 02:24:44.080]  have been dominated by eugenicist the billionaire founder of sun microsystems bill joy
[02:24:44.080 --> 02:24:50.720]  courageously went public in 2000 to warn of a cancerous consensus among the technocratic elite
[02:24:50.720 --> 02:24:57.520]  that at best humanity would be completely enslaved by the year 2030 and at worst mass extermination
[02:24:57.520 --> 02:25:05.600]  of everyone but the elite would take place a who's who of the techno elite are members of what is
[02:25:05.600 --> 02:25:13.360]  known as the transhumanist or post-humanist movement many of its adherents see only the
[02:25:13.360 --> 02:25:20.880]  beneficial aspects of technology's exponential rise like bringing sight to the blind sound of the
[02:25:20.880 --> 02:25:30.960]  death and longer life for all but what many of them don't know is that master eugenicist julian
[02:25:30.960 --> 02:25:37.440]  huxley founded transhumanism and that society's controllers openly admit that the new system
[02:25:37.440 --> 02:25:48.240]  is designed to progress into absolute tyranny leading transhumanist ray Kurzweil boasts that
[02:25:48.240 --> 02:25:54.400]  technological advancements will allow those that can afford it to live forever but admits that most
[02:25:54.400 --> 02:26:03.680]  won't be able to keep up with the new master race the drive for world government is now all about
[02:26:03.680 --> 02:26:13.840]  who will control and have access to radical life extension systems biological evolution is too slow
[02:26:13.840 --> 02:26:21.920]  for the human species over the next few decades it's going to be left in the dust transhumanists
[02:26:21.920 --> 02:26:28.640]  believe that they will attain the fountain of youth by merging with technology now it may be within
[02:26:28.640 --> 02:26:38.080]  their reach decades ago transhumanists said that if you do not accept augmentation or enhancements
[02:26:38.080 --> 02:26:44.800]  you would no longer be able to get jobs and now it's happening today
[02:26:46.960 --> 02:26:52.400]  the elite who occupy the commanding heights of digital reality are suicidal nihilists
[02:26:52.400 --> 02:26:57.680]  suicidal nihilists know that there is no longer any substantive purpose to their willing but they
[02:26:57.680 --> 02:27:03.120]  would always prefer to go on willing than not to act at all they can very happily ally themselves
[02:27:03.120 --> 02:27:10.240]  with a notion of nuclear holocaust or perfect extermination technology has become so powerful
[02:27:10.240 --> 02:27:15.600]  in its capacity for destruction that free humanity cannot afford to let psychopathic
[02:27:15.600 --> 02:27:21.760]  technocrats with delusions of grandeur repeat the mistakes of their forebears because it is highly
[02:27:21.760 --> 02:27:34.000]  probable that this time they may destroy everything including themselves in their mad rush for godhood
[02:27:34.000 --> 02:27:39.520]  in this film we have chronicled the overlords bloody orgy of experimentation which already
[02:27:39.520 --> 02:27:43.760]  claimed the lives of more than 150 million people in the 20th century
[02:27:43.760 --> 02:27:53.440]  and now they are promising to deliver an invincible tyranny that will dwarf their past exploits
[02:27:56.240 --> 02:28:00.320]  in the days of world war two there were sovereign nations and armies
[02:28:00.320 --> 02:28:02.960]  to stand against Hitler's final solution
[02:28:06.960 --> 02:28:12.640]  once world government is in place no one will be able to stop the new world order's plans
[02:28:12.640 --> 02:28:19.520]  for global population reduction for those immune to psychological program hundreds of fema camps
[02:28:19.520 --> 02:28:25.040]  have already been built throughout the united states in their quest for population reduction
[02:28:25.040 --> 02:28:31.520]  no method is off the table these dark builders intend to release a string of man-made bio weapons
[02:28:31.520 --> 02:28:38.640]  flags each one worse than the last while at the same time expanding the police state to enforce
[02:28:38.640 --> 02:28:44.240]  an orderly extermination of the population all in the name of fighting invisible terrorists
[02:28:47.120 --> 02:28:53.040]  and the georgia guide stones stand today as a cold testament to the elite's sacred mission
[02:28:58.000 --> 02:29:03.680]  to have a two-class system where the underclass are forced to live as slaves in tiny enclosed cities
[02:29:03.680 --> 02:29:11.280]  while the elite enjoy the land of the earth evolve into superhumans with the aid of advanced
[02:29:11.280 --> 02:29:18.560]  implantable technologies live eternal lives and travel throughout the cosmos this is the promise
[02:29:19.200 --> 02:29:24.560]  given to the inner members of the new world order and the agenda of the bilterberg group
[02:29:26.480 --> 02:29:31.040]  now we get into more proof in the film and show dr peonka talking about airborne Ebola and things
[02:29:31.040 --> 02:29:35.520]  like that that's a three-hour film that gives you an idea right there and here's peter thiel
[02:29:35.520 --> 02:29:40.240]  on telegraph saying their plan is to bring in a system for eternal life for the elite
[02:29:41.520 --> 02:29:45.840]  so there you go we've got a special guest joining us some other special reports coming

[02:34:06.960 --> 02:34:17.440]  and he joins us here to break down a whole host of issues today but but first off obama's
[02:34:17.440 --> 02:34:22.320]  supposed to get authorization from congress for military strikes obviously if nuclear missiles
[02:34:22.320 --> 02:34:26.480]  get launched or something he's allowed to respond there's an imminent threat well they're saying
[02:34:26.480 --> 02:34:32.720]  that isis is an imminent threat but the west funded it created it and now says they're going to give
[02:34:32.720 --> 02:34:39.920]  the non-radical armor but more money while bombing inside syria without their authorization the very
[02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:44.160]  rebel group they helped fund so as a former prosecutor i thought i'd get his take on that
[02:34:44.880 --> 02:34:50.560]  on obama's other executive actions and i know that when we talk about getting a line along a week ago
[02:34:50.560 --> 02:34:56.480]  he wanted to talk about ssri serotonin reuptake inhibitors other psychotropic turns out that

[02:37:26.000 --> 02:37:33.760]  we becoming some type of weird Byzantine empire are we becoming no we have become let me go right
[02:37:33.760 --> 02:37:39.760]  back to the first part of the show alex when you were overwhelmed by the stack of information that
[02:37:39.760 --> 02:37:44.080]  you had i could hear it in your voice and i hear it every day because i never missed a show where
[02:37:44.080 --> 02:37:52.960]  do i start where do i begin to delve in where do i start here's a question for you name one story
[02:37:52.960 --> 02:38:01.040]  one issue one story one piece of fact or data that absolutely was reported perfectly by the
[02:38:01.040 --> 02:38:06.080]  mainstream media go ahead take all the time you want other than fantasy football the Kardashians
[02:38:06.080 --> 02:38:13.920]  great rise adrian peterson nfl aside from that name one story in your stack that the mainstream
[02:38:13.920 --> 02:38:20.560]  media covered even addressed take all the time in the world you want answered none why is that
[02:38:20.560 --> 02:38:27.120]  that why because the public's so dumbed down the media is now so dumbed down and the world's so
[02:38:27.120 --> 02:38:33.440]  complex they have articles in the stack like we don't know what obama care does and we don't know
[02:38:33.440 --> 02:38:37.680]  if it's working and we don't know what's happened and we don't know what's happening on the border
[02:38:37.680 --> 02:38:42.240]  and we don't know who we're fighting or who we're funding it does seem like the disintegration of
[02:38:42.240 --> 02:38:49.520]  society and i can hear it in your voice you're saying why aren't there people banging on your door
[02:38:49.520 --> 02:38:54.960]  saying wait a minute where's that source why aren't people slamming their brakes on their cars
[02:38:54.960 --> 02:38:58.800]  saying i want to know this let me talk about something if you could and i think you've talked
[02:38:58.800 --> 02:39:07.440]  about it before this notion called hydro imperialism now one of the the greatest i think gifts that we
[02:39:07.440 --> 02:39:11.600]  as sentient human beings and adults can give the world is to let them know something that
[02:39:11.600 --> 02:39:16.160]  perhaps maybe they didn't know and you've got to know this and i'm sure you do that whenever the
[02:39:16.160 --> 02:39:20.240]  government says something like pilgers law says never believe anything until it's officially
[02:39:20.240 --> 02:39:27.280]  denied yes when they say that we're going someplace for a particular reason that's the cover so i
[02:39:27.280 --> 02:39:36.160]  ask people why do you think isis or isle or is or fsa or al-nusra fund or uh uh a qi or iqa
[02:39:37.040 --> 02:39:42.320]  why are we changing the name what do you think this is about it's not about terrorism in the first
[02:39:42.320 --> 02:39:50.240]  wave of imperialism it was gold let's get this gold to them our hills africa the british second way
[02:39:50.240 --> 02:39:57.920]  post-industrial oil made sense then the military began began to be the the luke brazil if you will
[02:39:57.920 --> 02:40:04.800]  of the american oil and petroleum industries and the world third way rare earth metals lithium
[02:40:04.800 --> 02:40:11.920]  which by the way saudi arabia or afghanistan is the saudi arabia of lithium and then now here we go
[02:40:12.640 --> 02:40:21.280]  water water finite absolute everybody knows the kids know that the world is covered by two
[02:40:21.280 --> 02:40:26.880]  thirds of it is covered by water well that's salt water okay if you're a fish two percent is an
[02:40:26.880 --> 02:40:34.480]  ice and glaciers one percent is available to us that's potable drinkable accessible water it will
[02:40:34.480 --> 02:40:42.800]  be the future currency ab so lovely and alex it's so ingenious when you think about it let's go back
[02:40:42.800 --> 02:40:48.560]  to more market off me and you said something because i listen alex i listen i listen maybe i
[02:40:48.560 --> 02:40:55.440]  listen too much i doubt that but i listen you said isn't it funny how we change the names of things
[02:40:55.440 --> 02:41:00.720]  remember it was al-qaeda not demore then isis not anymore now isle then they go back and forth with
[02:41:00.720 --> 02:41:06.800]  isle isle it sounds like characters from yentl yentl looks like a jacky mason routine now
[02:41:07.520 --> 02:41:14.720]  qaddafi how many ways can you spell qaddafi they even did that to us mausetoon mausetoon
[02:41:14.720 --> 02:41:23.440]  baking baking beijing cutter qatar when qaddafi was overthrown right when he was all of a
[02:41:23.440 --> 02:41:31.600]  sudden crazy when he's wearing the sergeant pepper outfits there is the the nubian sandstone aquifer
[02:41:32.160 --> 02:41:41.120]  underneath right there in libya maybe alex maybe just so happens to be the largest freshwater aquifer
[02:41:41.120 --> 02:41:49.280]  in the world in the world he had spent 25 billion dollars to take libya which is 95 96
[02:41:49.280 --> 02:41:57.360]  percent basically desert and make it airable make it usable iraq go back to biblical times
[02:41:57.360 --> 02:42:05.760]  the fertile crescent tigers and euphrates the the garden of eden this was water this this is the
[02:42:05.760 --> 02:42:13.040]  currency now in addition to the aforementioned so when we go to a country and we decide to either
[02:42:13.040 --> 02:42:18.240]  invade or liberate or whatever particular parlance you want to use i'm a lawyer by profession and you
[02:42:18.240 --> 02:42:24.320]  have studied the law as well you know that when you buy property you have air rights
[02:42:24.320 --> 02:42:30.240]  there's the old adcelem doctor and you've got surface and mineral correct but when you go to
[02:42:30.240 --> 02:42:37.040]  a country and you seize a country either by invitation or by liberation or whatever particular
[02:42:37.600 --> 02:42:45.680]  of fiction you use who owns the water below second question who does the water i guess
[02:42:45.680 --> 02:42:53.520]  who does the water belong to can you take water and put it on tankers like we use to use oil you
[02:42:53.520 --> 02:42:57.120]  know it gets into interesting issues alex sometimes when we go to different countries
[02:42:57.120 --> 02:43:02.240]  and we will invade or liberate or whatever you want to call it we find antiquities sometimes you
[02:43:02.240 --> 02:43:10.000]  can't return to the babeloneans that which was the babelonean waters a different story so if we
[02:43:10.000 --> 02:43:18.000]  go to iraq or iran or syria or wherever and by the way let me remind you that why israel in its
[02:43:18.000 --> 02:43:25.120]  existential fight existential something we have not really realized yet if the golan heights
[02:43:25.120 --> 02:43:30.480]  were to be either re assumed or taken back or whatever particular parlance you want to use
[02:43:30.480 --> 02:43:38.320]  by syria that's 40 percent of israel's drinking water water is the currency of life you can't get
[02:43:38.320 --> 02:43:43.360]  off of the water standard like we did the gold standard there's no stopgap measures it's not
[02:43:43.360 --> 02:43:52.560]  subject to speculation you don't hold back on water it is who we are and alex hydro imperialism
[02:43:52.560 --> 02:44:00.560]  is yet another subtext another stratum another layer to this labyrinth this calculus that we
[02:44:00.560 --> 02:44:06.160]  in the world are involved in so add that to your stat and add that to your worries well obviously
[02:44:06.160 --> 02:44:10.400]  you were alluding to the great lakes where i was reading years ago and i was in a documentary with
[02:44:10.400 --> 02:44:16.560]  jesse ventura about it dealing with the fact that every month hundreds of super tankers coming from
[02:44:16.560 --> 02:44:21.920]  china and japan and load up in the great lakes and just leave and they basically have a un treaty
[02:44:21.920 --> 02:44:26.880]  to just take our water and now the great lakes are going down the globalists have set the precedent
[02:44:26.880 --> 02:44:33.200]  where they just take the water if they want it and what's also interesting alex is when you tell
[02:44:33.200 --> 02:44:39.280]  somebody this when you tell somebody and you freak them out let me tell you the group of people
[02:44:39.280 --> 02:44:44.720]  that you're going to meet first of all there's a group who say adds a conspiracy a conspiracy
[02:44:44.720 --> 02:44:49.920]  theory conspiracy theories we've talked about a million times means something i don't want to hear
[02:44:49.920 --> 02:44:58.480]  something the fairest something backward something back room something illegal conspiracy theory to
[02:44:58.480 --> 02:45:02.400]  me means two guilty people conspiring what we're doing sometimes we're saying no this isn't a
[02:45:02.400 --> 02:45:08.160]  conspiracy this is a fact there there's no conspiracy that guy that's going into your
[02:45:08.160 --> 02:45:12.400]  neighbor's house stealing his furniture that's not a conspiracy that's called burglary or robbery
[02:45:12.400 --> 02:45:20.080]  depending upon it what so that that word is the blanket for distraction second people hate to
[02:45:20.080 --> 02:45:24.960]  be told something they should know they hate to be told something they should know and third
[02:45:24.960 --> 02:45:29.440]  they hate when you shatter a myth let me give you my new favorite how many times have you heard that
[02:45:29.440 --> 02:45:34.080]  olive extra virgin olive it was great because of the stink on the Mediterranean diet wrong
[02:45:34.720 --> 02:45:41.760]  it's fat it's a car yet so this is just olive oil we're not even talking about things that really
[02:45:41.760 --> 02:45:47.760]  bother i brought this up the other day at a restaurant people are running bread through
[02:45:47.760 --> 02:45:55.840]  pools of olive oil versus butter music well it's the Mediterranean diet i said it's fat no i read
[02:45:55.840 --> 02:46:04.400]  you didn't read it's a it's a myth that you misunderstood it's a jingoism precisely it's
[02:46:04.400 --> 02:46:13.440]  this thing that we are led to believe i was watching a study the other day on new efforts to go out
[02:46:13.440 --> 02:46:20.160]  into the world alexand look for life elsewhere and i made the statement why do we look at the life
[02:46:20.160 --> 02:46:28.400]  from other dimensions of planets that's landing here daily ask edgar mitchell ask gordon cooper
[02:46:28.400 --> 02:46:37.840]  ask astronaut what are you talking about that's crazy it's not crazy what is sane anymore i'm
[02:46:37.840 --> 02:46:46.720]  asking a very logical question i don't believe in myth i don't believe in folklore i believe in fat
[02:46:46.720 --> 02:46:54.640]  and it must infuriate you every day just tell us the truth tell the american people and the world
[02:46:54.640 --> 02:47:01.040]  that the reason why we in saudi arabia and british and english and american intel have concocted this
[02:47:01.040 --> 02:47:07.520]  boogie man the power of nightmares is a great bbc documentary said the reason why we're giving you
[02:47:07.520 --> 02:47:16.880]  isle and isis is in order for you to look at this be so horrified using the hegelian dialectic to turn
[02:47:16.880 --> 02:47:27.200]  to us beg us please do something while we go in and we bomb a country and and by the way why not ask
[02:47:27.200 --> 02:47:36.320]  aside to basically because i i think he has a bigger beef against isis than we do so i'm every
[02:47:36.320 --> 02:47:44.000]  day fighting this battle as to you say i'm looking for the truth i'm not the enemy i'm not a truther
[02:47:44.000 --> 02:47:50.560]  a conspiracy person i'm an american citizen who loves this country who loves the rule of law
[02:47:50.560 --> 02:47:56.560]  and i just want the truth and i don't want any more of our brave men and women sent to be the
[02:47:56.560 --> 02:48:03.760]  lucabrazi the enforcer for some asset stripping globalist financier jackal or whatever particular
[02:48:03.760 --> 02:48:08.720]  phrase you want to call it and expanding on that liners our guests from lineland media
[02:48:08.720 --> 02:48:13.680]  dot com syndicated radio host tv host in new york city and a lawyer prosecutor in his own right
[02:48:15.600 --> 02:48:21.280]  i saw articles in the new york times the london guardian just everywhere newt genridge was saying
[02:48:22.000 --> 02:48:25.520]  all these elites were saying the people are mad they don't buy what we're doing anymore
[02:48:25.520 --> 02:48:31.520]  there's a secession of stuff going on it's a crisis of the world order and that and that things
[02:48:31.520 --> 02:48:36.080]  are breaking down this weekend i was at a meeting that had a lot of big executives at it they were
[02:48:36.080 --> 02:48:40.240]  all concerned about their families they were looking to get out of the country and these things
[02:48:40.240 --> 02:48:45.840]  were high level so the elite even realizes not one monolith obviously that things are really
[02:48:45.840 --> 02:48:51.760]  screwed up i don't think the general public though realizes it yet and when the bottom falls
[02:48:51.760 --> 02:48:57.360]  out of this untenable carrying capacity whatever you want to call it that we've reached it is a time
[02:48:57.360 --> 02:49:04.480]  bomb i mean in your gut what do you think's gonna happen to civilization well it's it's well
[02:49:05.280 --> 02:49:09.280]  i think what's going to happen is that you will see a complete first a devolution and then an
[02:49:09.280 --> 02:49:15.840]  ultimate destruction how long that takes you know as anybody's guess the thing that i am amazed by
[02:49:15.840 --> 02:49:21.200]  alex's i'm in new york city right now and downtown we had a group of people who i think deep down
[02:49:21.200 --> 02:49:27.520]  inside deep down inside really truly wanted to do something if you know alex anytime somebody
[02:49:27.520 --> 02:49:33.280]  gets off their duff and goes out in the street whether it's a party and whether they trash the
[02:49:33.280 --> 02:49:40.080]  place that don't clean up another story but whenever somebody stops tweeting or or liking or
[02:49:40.080 --> 02:49:48.160]  posting or whatever i'm i'm heartened by that and i wanted to go and ask these people do you
[02:49:48.160 --> 02:49:55.680]  realize the kind that you are being a part of just like people who believe and nobody's suggesting
[02:49:55.680 --> 02:50:00.400]  that ices or isosas worry about you're talking about the big global warming march that just happened

[02:50:08.000 --> 02:50:13.760]  iceberg if i see that one more time and i try to explain to somebody do you understand that what

[02:54:08.880 --> 02:54:13.200]  i was sitting in traffic listening to the radio
[02:54:13.200 --> 02:54:24.640]  um
[02:54:27.520 --> 02:54:33.920]  here in my stack um like i found the article here it is this is out of chicago tribune
[02:54:33.920 --> 02:54:41.280]  google severs ties with conservative group over climate stance and it just basically said they
[02:54:41.280 --> 02:54:47.440]  won't do business with them or operate with them or do do web platforms with them because quote no
[02:54:47.440 --> 02:54:52.560]  one questions that global warming and climate change is real google is breaking ties with
[02:54:52.560 --> 02:54:58.880]  american legislative exchange council a prominent network of a conservative state legislators among
[02:54:58.880 --> 02:55:05.120]  other projects works to rollback laws that promote uh solar and wind power the company's chairman said
[02:55:05.120 --> 02:55:13.840]  monday the decision marks a major victory for the campaign for environmentalists and it just goes on
[02:55:15.600 --> 02:55:22.080]  censoring not letting gun shops have bank accounts or things like this is real draconian
[02:55:22.080 --> 02:55:27.920]  authoritarianism you can say well google's a private company says microsoft let them do what they want
[02:55:28.960 --> 02:55:33.680]  okay well then if somebody doesn't like someone's sexual persuasion are you not going to sell them
[02:55:33.680 --> 02:55:40.480]  a house and say well it's your free market right the so-called left tried to pioneer they claim
[02:55:40.480 --> 02:55:45.360]  it was really republicans and i'm nonpartisan that's just a fact the civil rights acts and other things
[02:55:45.360 --> 02:55:52.000]  so many issues where they're claiming they're trying to stop discrimination but now there's
[02:55:52.000 --> 02:55:58.320]  a whole another level of it and they say on the article climate change denial will not be tolerated
[02:55:58.320 --> 02:56:03.680]  like like they're saying it's holocaust denial or something that's pretty scary because why
[02:56:03.680 --> 02:56:07.200]  well i don't think anybody's denying there are a lot of serious environmental issues i'd rather
[02:56:07.200 --> 02:56:13.520]  have those dealt with and covered but paying a carbon tax to a few hundred rich guys and moving
[02:56:13.520 --> 02:56:20.560]  our jobs to india where they have you know dirty plants or to mexico that's all this is a scam no
[02:56:20.560 --> 02:56:25.760]  one can debate that see but you know alex nobody is suggesting and i'm not suggesting that there
[02:56:25.760 --> 02:56:36.240]  is not some cyclical sun solar related warming or climate change that's not the issue yeah we're not
[02:56:36.240 --> 02:56:42.560]  even denying it but if we wanted to that's all right right well there was a guy named galileo
[02:56:42.560 --> 02:56:48.320]  who wanted to deny the notion of a geocentric universe as well and what happened to him look
[02:56:48.320 --> 02:56:56.160]  here's my challenge to the carbon tax if algor sign something that said i hereby
[02:56:56.160 --> 02:57:02.640]  believe so much in the notion of change of this anthropogenic man made i'm gonna sell my 10
[02:57:02.640 --> 02:57:10.240]  mansions that are 20 000 square feet but i i believe in this so much i'm gonna sign something
[02:57:10.240 --> 02:57:16.880]  disavowing any profit that i ever made from any kind of carbon exchange or or carbon uh uh uh
[02:57:16.880 --> 02:57:24.880]  taxing i am so then i'll listen to him if you do that if you tell me that this is truly a belief
[02:57:24.880 --> 02:57:32.560]  that you have then we've got to you know reel in and and and tamp down this bouncing of carbon
[02:57:32.560 --> 02:57:40.480]  fine i'm with you but until he does that what this is is to get people into a religion that this is
[02:57:40.480 --> 02:57:46.640]  something that everybody believes in to make even those who question it to seem bloodite and stupid
[02:57:46.640 --> 02:57:54.560]  by the way this is a the vehicle of the professional left you know this is a country out that used to
[02:57:54.560 --> 02:58:00.080]  believe in this thing called 1984 i gotta mention this to you the other day again in new york and
[02:58:00.080 --> 02:58:07.840]  around the country people are standing in lines waiting so they can now take a gps forget the
[02:58:07.840 --> 02:58:13.520]  carcinogenic aspect of it but this thing that they would just carry in their pocket now they're going

[03:01:09.760 --> 03:01:14.560]  of all the facts that you presented were really struck me the most was at the end you know you
[03:01:14.560 --> 03:01:18.800]  point in the camera and you say you are the resistance and you say you are important
[03:01:20.560 --> 03:01:25.760]  and i really uh that really hit my soul and i just wanted to say you know as much as it is
[03:01:25.760 --> 03:01:32.400]  important to spread the information that you're spreading and show people the truth there are
[03:01:32.400 --> 03:01:37.200]  certain people who are not ready to see it right now and i think that what we have to do to get
[03:01:37.200 --> 03:01:43.520]  them to that point is be able to uplift them and encourage them you know spreading a positive
[03:01:43.520 --> 03:01:52.400]  message as well as the exposing the the nastiness of what's going on right um and i say that to say
[03:01:52.400 --> 03:01:56.800]  you know i'm planning to start my own community organization you know inspired a lot by some of
[03:01:56.800 --> 03:02:00.720]  the things that i found out through you and also just some of the general truth that i've come to
[03:02:00.720 --> 03:02:08.000]  speak um and just wanted to you know just just keep you keep you encouraged man keep fighting the
[03:02:08.000 --> 03:02:13.840]  good fight and uh you know stay up because i know it's it's stressful i can i can hear it when i

[03:02:20.480 --> 03:02:26.720]  battle we just have to claim our victory right now thank you eric god bless you i i absolutely
[03:02:26.720 --> 03:02:33.520]  agree with what you're saying tarence in canada you're on the air go ahead you know good that's
[03:02:33.520 --> 03:02:38.720]  good it's good um so yeah about what's going on in the middle east right now that i think it's
[03:02:38.720 --> 03:02:50.080]  absolutely disgusting i agree with you it's like so first they they arm these rebels to take down
[03:02:50.080 --> 03:02:58.160]  a sod and then they use that as a pretext to they use now that they're they're now that they form
[03:02:58.160 --> 03:03:05.680]  ISIS now and from Turkey Saudi Arabia and they're willing to put our troops on the line and the way
[03:03:05.680 --> 03:03:11.520]  i see it is that there can really know there can be no true peace unless people really understand
[03:03:11.520 --> 03:03:16.160]  each other and that they only understand each other's pain and that's when you i think we can have
[03:03:16.160 --> 03:03:26.480]  peace but they don't want peace it's all about it's all about gaining money and and and destabilizing
[03:03:26.480 --> 03:03:32.480]  the middle east what's your take that's it screw the place up so it's weak people are unorganized
[03:03:32.480 --> 03:03:36.640]  with a bunch of cavemen running around murdering people so the big corporations can roll in after
[03:03:36.640 --> 03:03:40.960]  the locusts have passed and then the public found out our government was funding al-qaeda so they're
[03:03:40.960 --> 03:03:45.920]  doing some fake bombing raids on them and changing the name every five minutes it's disgusting one
[03:03:45.920 --> 03:03:51.360]  more caller eric in florida go ahead you got about a minute and a half awesome i'm glad to finally be
[03:03:51.360 --> 03:03:57.920]  able to talk to you uh you remember the story 500 million dollars uh out of the mosul central bank
[03:03:58.480 --> 03:04:08.720]  yes okay it was actually 500 billion iraqi denars and that 62.5 tons of money and it would be
[03:04:09.440 --> 03:04:16.000]  over a mile and a half wide so it it's it's being funded by the banks just like world war one and
[03:04:16.000 --> 03:04:22.160]  world war two and it's it's all a setup and this is a setup we hit syria and it's gonna
[03:04:22.880 --> 03:04:29.120]  we have russia better russia's backing syria and iran and it's it's it's it's playing it's all over
[03:04:29.120 --> 03:04:36.320]  again it's starting in the middle east and uh yeah 62.5 tons of cash is what they would have had a
[03:04:36.320 --> 03:04:45.120]  steal and and it just to me it sounds unlogical so and your thoughts no i totally agree with you
[03:04:45.120 --> 03:04:49.280]  and that's what we're here exposing and the good news is there's now a national debate about this
[03:04:50.000 --> 03:04:53.760]  people are going wait a minute this is the same group we help create what's going on here
[03:04:53.760 --> 03:05:17.680]  all right big broadcast tomorrow lined up nightly news tonight seven o'clock great job group
