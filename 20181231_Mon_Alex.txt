[00:00.000 --> 00:16.000]  There is a lot of controversy around this network about Alex Jones, for example.
[00:16.000 --> 00:27.000]  Alex Jones, the far-right conspiracy theorist who was a parent.
[00:27.000 --> 00:36.000]  Alex Jones, Russian scum.
[00:36.000 --> 00:42.000]  If a war comes to mind.
[00:42.000 --> 00:53.000]  I will not let you down. You will be very, very impressed, I hope.
[01:12.000 --> 01:36.000]  It is the final Alex Jones show of 2018. What a year.
[01:36.000 --> 01:43.000]  And I got to say, sitting back and thinking, it's been a good year.
[01:43.000 --> 01:48.000]  It's been a rough year. It's been hard fought.
[01:48.000 --> 01:51.000]  And a lot of good things happened and a lot of bad things happened.
[01:51.000 --> 02:01.000]  But in the final summation, if you read establishment publications like The Wall Street Journal,
[02:01.000 --> 02:09.000]  Financial Times of London and Atlantic Monthly, where the globalists communicate with each other,
[02:09.000 --> 02:20.000]  they are licking grievous wounds and openly talking about how they're losing their world government
[02:20.000 --> 02:25.000]  and how nationalism and Christianity and populism is exploding,
[02:25.000 --> 02:30.000]  and they talk about how they're going to counter it, and that's by creating global race war.
[02:30.000 --> 02:36.000]  If you study how the British would control India with only a few thousand troops for over 200 years,
[02:36.000 --> 02:40.000]  they called it the Great Game.
[02:40.000 --> 02:49.000]  And they wrote about it in British newspapers until the 1900s and Indians started moving to England some
[02:49.000 --> 02:54.000]  and started sending newspapers back where the British government was talking about how they would play
[02:54.000 --> 03:01.000]  different tribes off against each other and how they sent sociologists in to learn how to manipulate them.
[03:01.000 --> 03:04.000]  They didn't Afghanistan, Pakistan, you name it.
[03:04.000 --> 03:09.000]  But here's a Wall Street Journal article out today.
[03:09.000 --> 03:14.000]  2018 biggest loser was the liberal international order.
[03:14.000 --> 03:21.000]  When they mean liberal, they've been big megamanks above the law that pay no taxes spying on you with big tech
[03:21.000 --> 03:29.000]  and creating cultural division and destroying the first world in a reverse colonial operation,
[03:29.000 --> 03:32.000]  which also hurts the third world as well.
[03:32.000 --> 03:40.000]  So humanity started to get its footing in 2016 and you saw a lot of prosperity come back
[03:40.000 --> 03:46.000]  because Trump could just rest the wheel of the economy away from the private Federal Reserve a little bit.
[03:46.000 --> 03:55.000]  He had a little bit of a course correction, but it was like a man coming up from deep water and finally getting a breath.
[03:55.000 --> 04:01.000]  But they've shoved our face right back in the water as fast as they can and are now blaming Trump.
[04:01.000 --> 04:09.000]  So as we accelerate into 2019, all I can say is start your engines.
[04:09.000 --> 04:16.000]  Strap yourselves in and get ready because it's going to be the year of the globalist counter offensive.
[04:16.000 --> 04:30.000]  84 new investigations that these different committees are going to fire up in T minus three days.
[04:30.000 --> 04:39.000]  Three days, ladies and gentlemen, until all of this kicks in.
[04:39.000 --> 04:41.000]  And so brace yourselves.
[04:41.000 --> 04:49.000]  But the good news is humanity's coming out of the trance and is realizing we're at a fight.
[04:49.000 --> 04:54.000]  And we've got a good shot at this if we get on our knees and pray to God and then take action.
[04:54.000 --> 04:56.000]  Big broadcast today, a lot of big guests.
[04:56.000 --> 05:00.000]  You don't want a message. Stay with us.
[05:00.000 --> 05:06.000]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember this life is a test.
[05:06.000 --> 05:15.000]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity coming back from the dead and recognizing it's being persecuted.
[05:15.000 --> 05:27.000]  That's all because you are the core listening to them for wars around the world, the eyes and ears of Liberty that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist program.
[05:27.000 --> 05:37.000]  Everybody knows who studies this that it's Christians, real Christians who tend to be immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it.
[05:37.000 --> 05:39.000]  And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[05:39.000 --> 05:45.000]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying 2018 has been insane.
[05:45.000 --> 05:51.000]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[05:51.000 --> 05:55.000]  Not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists.
[05:55.000 --> 06:23.000]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute you.
[06:23.000 --> 06:30.000]  Well, I began to really say it more than 10 years ago on air and in speeches.
[06:30.000 --> 06:32.000]  My speeches aren't prepared.
[06:32.000 --> 06:34.000]  I don't write them down.
[06:34.000 --> 06:37.000]  They're not done by speech writers.
[06:37.000 --> 06:40.000]  They just come from my gut and from history.
[06:40.000 --> 06:46.000]  But I began to have a little saying that I don't know how all of this is going to end.
[06:46.000 --> 06:50.000]  But if you want to fight, you better believe you've got one.
[06:50.000 --> 06:59.000]  And you see humanity all over the globe, awakening to the globalist paradigm and the fact that it is authoritarian cancer.
[06:59.000 --> 07:14.000]  And even the Wall Street Journal, even the Financial Times of London and others today have articles out admitting that the liberal world government, global governance, has been shot to pieces.
[07:14.000 --> 07:16.000]  It's like Humpty Dumpty.
[07:16.000 --> 07:27.000]  But you've got Merkel in a speech she gave this weekend, repeating what she said last week, that the enemy of nation-states, we must get rid of nation-states just like Macron said, the greatest form of patriotism is not having a country.
[07:27.000 --> 07:29.000]  These are quotes.
[07:29.000 --> 07:37.000]  Can't make this up, that they need 200 million Africans just in France alone and that Africa is the heart of France and the birthplace of France.
[07:37.000 --> 07:39.000]  And you say, that doesn't make sense.
[07:39.000 --> 07:41.000]  That's upside down world.
[07:41.000 --> 07:45.000]  It's meant to break your will.
[07:45.000 --> 07:46.000]  They're testing.
[07:46.000 --> 07:48.000]  That's why what did Merkel say?
[07:48.000 --> 07:53.000]  She said, we shouldn't care what our nation's people think.
[07:53.000 --> 07:57.000]  We need to totally open the borders and merge with the Middle East and Africa.
[07:57.000 --> 08:00.000]  And we need an orderly governance to do this.
[08:00.000 --> 08:09.000]  And she's back in the news today saying, we need a government to oversee it.
[08:09.000 --> 08:10.000]  And of course, who is that?
[08:10.000 --> 08:13.000]  Oh, it's the European Union and the UN.
[08:13.000 --> 08:16.000]  Oh, I see. They build the refugee camps.
[08:16.000 --> 08:18.000]  They suck off the third world.
[08:18.000 --> 08:20.000]  They organize the giant hordes.
[08:20.000 --> 08:21.000]  They then collapse the borders.
[08:21.000 --> 08:24.000]  They bring in the first wave of 15 million.
[08:24.000 --> 08:27.000]  Tourism goes down 80 plus percent.
[08:27.000 --> 08:29.000]  No go zones all over Europe.
[08:29.000 --> 08:38.000]  Top French police, top Danish police, top German police, top Swedish police all say, we are failed societies in the last month.
[08:38.000 --> 08:42.000]  They said, we are in a war.
[08:42.000 --> 08:44.000]  Why are you collapsing everything?
[08:44.000 --> 08:46.000]  No one's coming for tourism.
[08:46.000 --> 08:48.000]  There's murder all over the place.
[08:48.000 --> 08:49.000]  Mass rape.
[08:49.000 --> 08:51.000]  The leftist judges are releasing the Muslims when they do it.
[08:51.000 --> 08:53.000]  Hang grenade attack.
[08:53.000 --> 08:54.000]  Machine gun attacks every day.
[08:54.000 --> 08:56.000]  Mass plowing attacks every day.
[08:56.000 --> 08:59.000]  Until Siddiq Khan's proven right.
[08:59.000 --> 09:01.000]  The Islamic mayor of London.
[09:01.000 --> 09:02.000]  The jihadi mayor.
[09:02.000 --> 09:05.000]  He said, just get used to it two years ago.
[09:05.000 --> 09:07.000]  And then he said it again this year.
[09:07.000 --> 09:09.000]  Just get used to it.
[09:09.000 --> 09:12.000]  I've actually gotten used to it.
[09:12.000 --> 09:25.000]  There's so many articles on infowars.com and newswars.com and europewars.com that link to more mass rapes, more mass killings, more machine gun attacks.
[09:25.000 --> 09:28.000]  Now they just admit that whole sections of major cities.
[09:28.000 --> 09:35.000]  I was looking at maps in Germany and Sweden of where they won't deliver mail, where plumbers won't come.
[09:35.000 --> 09:44.000]  And so there's now feces everywhere and broken sewage and the Islamists are almost all on welfare, walking around in nightgowns.
[09:44.000 --> 09:45.000]  The men.
[09:45.000 --> 09:48.000]  Just lazy stupid jackasses.
[09:48.000 --> 09:50.000]  Arrogant.
[09:50.000 --> 09:52.000]  Brought in as the Trojan horse.
[09:52.000 --> 10:04.000]  And then Merkel says and Macron says the answer is having the EU army and navy orderly bring in more.
[10:04.000 --> 10:06.000]  Which was always the plan.
[10:06.000 --> 10:09.000]  Oh, and the second bigger caravan.
[10:09.000 --> 10:12.000]  They're not saying it's 200 and then it was 50,000 for that.
[10:12.000 --> 10:20.000]  Now they're admitting it's 50,000 are mashing in Honduras and Guatemala for the next invasion force.
[10:20.000 --> 10:26.000]  And Bito O'Rourke tweeted out over the weekend that he was so pleased.
[10:26.000 --> 10:36.000]  That thousands a day of the illegal aliens are just being released because they don't have jails, they don't have ice facilities and the judges are just saying release them.
[10:36.000 --> 10:38.000]  Release them.
[10:38.000 --> 10:39.000]  You can get here.
[10:39.000 --> 10:40.000]  You make it across.
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.000]  You're in gratis.
[10:44.000 --> 10:49.000]  And if they collapse us, it's done.
[10:49.000 --> 10:58.000]  So the president understands the world's awakening to globalism and how big mega corporations that their own armored fortresses from the Vatican.
[10:58.000 --> 11:01.000]  It's a mega corporation to Google.
[11:01.000 --> 11:06.000]  It's a big mega corporation to the Democratic Party and the multiple 10 foot walls.
[11:06.000 --> 11:09.000]  They've gotten 20 foot walls around their houses like Obama.
[11:09.000 --> 11:16.000]  We've sent cameras to Obama's second White House a mile from the real White House.
[11:16.000 --> 11:21.000]  It's got two walls around it, just like Zuckerberg's got big walls.
[11:21.000 --> 11:29.000]  Everybody else has got big walls, but you can't have walls.
[11:29.000 --> 11:33.000]  And so Trump's desperately trying to have a big wall.
[11:33.000 --> 11:36.000]  And then they start going, oh, now you want big metal slats?
[11:36.000 --> 11:38.000]  Well, that's a wall.
[11:38.000 --> 11:40.000]  And the military says it's the best design.
[11:40.000 --> 11:41.000]  Oh, you lied to us.
[11:41.000 --> 11:52.000]  So he's the bad one because he can't get him to act and he stood up to him and shut down the government and is asking for enough to repair what's there and fill up all the other critical sectors.
[11:52.000 --> 11:58.000]  And because he's trying, he's the bad guy.
[11:58.000 --> 12:06.000]  Meanwhile, Pocahontas has announced she's running for president.
[12:06.000 --> 12:13.000]  It's an amazing time to be alive.
[12:13.000 --> 12:15.000]  And of course, the censorship is heating up.
[12:15.000 --> 12:19.000]  So they want to plunge economies of nationalist countries.
[12:19.000 --> 12:30.000]  That's what the globalists are doing to teach Italy a lesson and the US a lesson and the UK a lesson that they're on the news saying we're going to shut your stock markets down and plunge your pensions.
[12:30.000 --> 12:35.000]  If you don't sign on to the EU and if you don't sign on to open borders and if you don't sign on to globalism.
[12:35.000 --> 12:41.000]  And the average person doesn't take that as the ultimatum and as the terrorism.
[12:41.000 --> 12:46.000]  The financial terrorism is it's just kind of like, oh, yeah, see the economy's plunging better get in line.
[12:46.000 --> 12:53.000]  Trump and top neocons have joined all these Democrats on TV saying, yeah, the economy's going down.
[12:53.000 --> 12:58.000]  Now we can impeach Trump cheerleading our own collapse.
[12:58.000 --> 12:59.000]  And this is a good thing.
[12:59.000 --> 13:03.000]  These are the good guys.
[13:03.000 --> 13:07.000]  No, these are not the good guys.
[13:07.000 --> 13:08.000]  They're open.
[13:08.000 --> 13:10.000]  They're coming after our children.
[13:10.000 --> 13:12.000]  There isn't one taboo.
[13:12.000 --> 13:16.000]  They don't want to break because they want our will broken.
[13:16.000 --> 13:25.000]  This is called when you occupy a nation, the only way to make them give up to a foreign occupier is called one word demoralization.
[13:25.000 --> 13:33.000]  There is one way unless you kill everybody and that is to demoralize them.
[13:33.000 --> 13:36.000]  And you read the WikiLeaks and you read the Financial Times of London.
[13:36.000 --> 13:37.000]  This stuff's public.
[13:37.000 --> 13:38.000]  And what do they say?
[13:38.000 --> 13:49.000]  The answer is culture war, racial and division between the sexes, a modern great game of divide and conquer.
[13:49.000 --> 13:54.000]  And they sit there in people's faces saying they're doing it like we're not even human.
[13:54.000 --> 13:58.000]  They're up there above us going, oh, just escalate race war.
[13:58.000 --> 14:02.000]  Every major movie's about whites being mean to blacks or women being oppressed.
[14:02.000 --> 14:11.000]  And it's being done by the ruling, horrible, evil globalist that are backing radical Islam, literally mass murdering and enslaving women all over the planet.
[14:11.000 --> 14:15.000]  And not a damn word out of the filthy feminists because they're not feminists.
[14:15.000 --> 14:20.000]  They're whores of the pimp state.
[14:20.000 --> 14:26.000]  And they deliver their sons to be chemically castrated and to be put on Ritalin and Prozac because the government said so.
[14:26.000 --> 14:31.000]  And they feminized their sons as an act of attacking any form of resistance.
[14:31.000 --> 14:33.000]  They are agents of evil.
[14:33.000 --> 14:38.000]  They are collaborators.
[14:38.000 --> 14:45.000]  Oh, and where was Franklin Graham and where was the Christian coalition and all these groups when I got taken off the Internet?
[14:45.000 --> 14:47.000]  Not a word.
[14:47.000 --> 14:50.000]  Oh, and then all the other libertarians and conservatives.
[14:50.000 --> 14:54.000]  And now Michael Savage is having a show taken away and it's being, but he can't talk about it because the contract I can.
[14:54.000 --> 14:58.000]  And it's being given to Shapiro.
[14:58.000 --> 15:04.000]  I warned everyone and now Franklin Graham AP reports.
[15:04.000 --> 15:13.000]  Well, one of the 15,000 fact checkers that Facebook employs trained by the Southern Poverty Law Center and media matters.
[15:13.000 --> 15:14.000]  That's on record.
[15:14.000 --> 15:23.000]  He actually says it was mistaken for a post from 2016 where Franklin Graham said that there was, you know, two genders and some other things.
[15:23.000 --> 15:27.000]  And they said, this is dehumanization.
[15:27.000 --> 15:32.000]  But when they went, wait, you just went after a guy with at least 50 million members.
[15:32.000 --> 15:34.000]  They might actually get Congress to do something.
[15:34.000 --> 15:36.000]  Oh, wait, you can stay.
[15:36.000 --> 15:38.000]  You can stay.
[15:38.000 --> 15:40.000]  See how that works.
[15:40.000 --> 15:42.000]  What's the real dehumanization?
[15:42.000 --> 15:49.000]  You can't stand in teaching a five-year-old girl or boy that they're another sex and totally molesting their mind and screwing them up.
[15:49.000 --> 15:56.000]  Because you're running a larger global government project of depopulation and destruction of the family, which is on record.
[15:56.000 --> 15:58.000]  That's been dehumanization.
[15:58.000 --> 16:23.000]  That's been dehumanization.
[16:23.000 --> 16:52.000]  That's been dehumanization.
[16:52.000 --> 17:20.000]  That's been dehumanization.
[17:20.000 --> 17:46.000]  That's been dehumanization.
[17:46.000 --> 18:02.000]  That's been dehumanization.
[18:02.000 --> 18:30.000]  That's been dehumanization.
[18:30.000 --> 18:58.000]  That's been dehumanization.
[19:00.000 --> 19:26.000]  That's been dehumanization.
[19:26.000 --> 19:52.000]  That's been dehumanization.
[19:52.000 --> 20:18.000]  That's been dehumanization.
[20:18.000 --> 20:44.000]  That's been dehumanization.
[20:44.000 --> 21:10.000]  That's been dehumanization.
[21:10.000 --> 21:38.000]  That's been dehumanization.
[21:38.000 --> 21:52.000]  Isn't it illustrative that Mattis and Kelly, the outgoing generals that Trump brought in, both have made jabs at the president?
[21:52.000 --> 22:08.000]  And I was told by really informed sources that they basically deceived the president and told him everything that he wanted to hear about how they would back him and how they would make America great again, people.
[22:08.000 --> 22:17.000]  Back when someone who he really was listening at the time was his, quote, chief advisor.
[22:17.000 --> 22:26.000]  And that, of course, was Stephen Bannon, now diminished, but still very dangerous.
[22:26.000 --> 22:30.000]  And he tries to put his fingers in everything, his hands on everything.
[22:30.000 --> 22:34.000]  He tries to claim credit for what's happening in the World Wide Revolution.
[22:34.000 --> 22:42.000]  He tries to go around the wars that are already going on and put himself on a horse at the head of it and act like once a war is already going that, you know, he's the commander.
[22:42.000 --> 22:48.000]  That's when he's done hanging around with the disgraced pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
[22:48.000 --> 22:55.000]  You know, the liberal press, there's no pedophilia going on at this Catholic church, all these big groups, universities, governmental order.
[22:55.000 --> 22:58.000]  I mean, you can't swing a stick and any power structure.
[22:58.000 --> 23:03.000]  I had a pedophile or people hanging out with pedophiles, but I digress.
[23:03.000 --> 23:13.000]  And I remember not going after Bannon a year and a half ago, just because he was in the White House when I was hearing all this, and not going after Kelly and not going after Mattis.
[23:13.000 --> 23:15.000]  Mad dog Mattis.
[23:15.000 --> 23:18.000]  And he always tries to act real scary and tough.
[23:18.000 --> 23:25.000]  I mean, the guy led an attack on Fallujah and said, kill all the men.
[23:25.000 --> 23:26.000]  I mean, that's routine.
[23:26.000 --> 23:27.000]  Okay.
[23:27.000 --> 23:30.000]  I mean, compared to other generals in US history, he's a joke.
[23:30.000 --> 23:35.000]  But see, oh, I mean, I knew he was bad because the media is always mad dog Mattis.
[23:35.000 --> 23:36.000]  He's good.
[23:36.000 --> 23:40.000]  Oh, John Kelly, they're the adults in the room with Trump.
[23:40.000 --> 23:45.000]  And I was like, man, this, this, this doesn't look good.
[23:45.000 --> 23:50.000]  And now they're involved in their jabs as they go.
[23:50.000 --> 23:56.000]  I mean, if they had a new person to play Emperor Palpatine, Mattis has got that look going.
[23:56.000 --> 24:00.000]  I mean, I got some bags under my eyes, but boy, you could milk those.
[24:00.000 --> 24:02.000]  They could run like a dairy.
[24:02.000 --> 24:05.000]  I was like, cow udders hanging below his eyes.
[24:05.000 --> 24:07.000]  And I've gone and looked at his record.
[24:07.000 --> 24:14.000]  I mean, the left of CNN is like, maybe the greatest general in US history.
[24:14.000 --> 24:15.000]  Wow.
[24:15.000 --> 24:23.000]  I mean, he's not even in the league with George Washington or Andrew Jackson or Patton or
[24:23.000 --> 24:27.000]  the list goes on and on.
[24:27.000 --> 24:29.000]  I mean, it's joke level.
[24:29.000 --> 24:33.000]  Oh, and then John Kelly.
[24:33.000 --> 24:39.000]  I mean, he at least did try to stop Al Qaeda and Grimfully was the head of Southcom coming in and did do some good things on the border.
[24:39.000 --> 24:47.000]  But these guys all got where they are because they're social climbers and they're yes men.
[24:47.000 --> 24:52.000]  And so when you get up to kernels and above, they belong to the deep state.
[24:52.000 --> 25:02.000]  Even if they aren't out to get the country, they are part of that structure and they all try to cover their butts.
[25:02.000 --> 25:06.000]  And so they'll say one thing to one person and another thing to another person.
[25:06.000 --> 25:09.000]  And I think that's real Machiavelli and real smart.
[25:09.000 --> 25:14.000]  And it's so sycophantic in DC.
[25:14.000 --> 25:20.000]  It's a bunch of un-American garbage.
[25:20.000 --> 25:23.000]  All kissing each other's butts.
[25:23.000 --> 25:33.000]  All shelling out America's power and America's industry and America's largesse and telling themselves what geniuses they are with this global government they've set up.
[25:33.000 --> 25:44.000]  When all they've done is set up the chai comms to be in a superior position to us and let our technology, all of it, big tech, everything move there.
[25:44.000 --> 25:52.000]  And totally betray us and then along comes somebody that says, why are we doing this? Even if you were Machiavelli, you parlay American power into dominance.
[25:52.000 --> 25:56.000]  You wouldn't get rid of it, you idiots.
[25:56.000 --> 26:11.000]  But you see it's spiritual and they come from a bunch of sellouts and yes men positioned by globalists show their pedigree is they claim, oh, they're patriotic and they love the country, but they don't.
[26:11.000 --> 26:14.000]  They don't.
[26:14.000 --> 26:19.000]  They are waging war against any power structure that is virtuous and independent and strong.
[26:19.000 --> 26:26.000]  It's why they seek and are always seeking to destroy Christendom, to destroy the family and to destroy the West.
[26:26.000 --> 26:38.000]  Because once they've got that, they have no problem managing the third world, no problem managing slave factories in China, no problem managing the sweat shops in India,
[26:38.000 --> 26:49.000]  no problem managing the slaves in Mexico that the Mexican government calls cockroaches and peons, poor people.
[26:49.000 --> 26:53.000]  That's the elite there. They keep them poor on purpose.
[26:53.000 --> 27:01.000]  The American system is the tail end of the Renaissance where we believe we were going to make everybody successful and get rid of the slums and get rid of it.
[27:01.000 --> 27:08.000]  Malthus and others said set up the slums 350 years ago to keep them poor and keep them dumb.
[27:08.000 --> 27:16.000]  It's called policy and how dare Trump want to get rid of that.
[27:16.000 --> 27:23.000]  But you know, once people are trained to only care about lottery tickets and only care about their vape or only care about whatever,
[27:23.000 --> 27:32.000]  once they're on the gravy train of watching the sitcoms and all the rest of the anti-family garbage where every male role model is an idiot,
[27:32.000 --> 27:40.000]  once that happens, once you've sabotaged the society and once you've shipped the jobs overseas and once you've not made it cool to work,
[27:40.000 --> 27:45.000]  you've broken the will and you've demoralized the people.
[27:45.000 --> 27:54.000]  And so yes, we're beating their current world government system right now and this phase, but it's a period victory.
[27:54.000 --> 28:01.000]  If we don't, means you know, we won this war but we end up really losing the culture.
[28:01.000 --> 28:05.000]  It's a war you win but you end up kind of losing.
[28:05.000 --> 28:14.000]  If we don't get our moral house in order and if we don't start honoring real feminine virtue and real male virtue,
[28:14.000 --> 28:21.000]  and if we don't start uplifting the idea of male resistance to tyranny,
[28:21.000 --> 28:27.000]  there will always be corrupt males that come in and enslave and that's why they're removing the male.
[28:27.000 --> 28:34.000]  The super alpha males, whether it's a grizzly bear or whether it's a lion or whether it's a tiger,
[28:34.000 --> 28:40.000]  they go find the next alpha male coming up and kill them before they ever grow.
[28:40.000 --> 28:46.000]  They kill them while they're little. They kill them before they can ever get knee-high to a grasshopper.
[28:46.000 --> 28:50.000]  And it's exactly why they're targeting your boys.
[28:50.000 --> 28:55.000]  These people are maximum evil. They make Hitler look like a lightweight.
[28:55.000 --> 29:21.000]  They'll be right back.
[29:25.000 --> 29:29.000]  We'll fill ammo.com.
[29:56.000 --> 30:04.000]  We all know that the outside toxins in the water is a serious health issue.
[30:04.000 --> 30:11.000]  Info Wars is proud to sell incredible filters but it's almost impossible to keep up with every faucet, shower and sink in your home.

[31:00.000 --> 31:05.000]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[31:05.000 --> 31:12.000]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no close,
[31:12.000 --> 31:15.000]  that can call BS, it's game over.
[31:15.000 --> 31:20.000]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity,
[31:20.000 --> 31:24.000]  they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[31:24.000 --> 31:32.000]  There's only two groups in the U.S. Infowars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com that are truly independent,
[31:32.000 --> 31:35.000]  and of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[31:35.000 --> 31:37.000]  It really is amazing.
[31:37.000 --> 31:44.000]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[31:44.000 --> 31:49.000]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of Infowars.
[31:49.000 --> 31:54.000]  So please spread the links, infowarstore.com, newswarstore.com, christenpudda.com,
[31:54.000 --> 31:57.000]  because if you don't spread the articles in the videos, no one else will.
[31:57.000 --> 32:03.000]  We're all in each other's hands. God bless you all and thank you.
[32:28.000 --> 32:35.000]  Everybody knows who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians who tend to be immune to the globalist brainwashing
[32:35.000 --> 32:39.000]  and who tend to see it, and that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[32:39.000 --> 32:42.000]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying.
[32:42.000 --> 32:44.000]  2018 has been insane.
[32:44.000 --> 32:51.000]  2019 is going to be the big decision-maker, and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[32:51.000 --> 32:55.000]  Not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists.
[32:55.000 --> 33:00.000]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute you.
[33:26.000 --> 33:29.000]  Rallying Patriots worldwide.
[33:33.000 --> 33:36.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:39.000 --> 33:45.000]  So we've seen some incredible developments in 2018.
[33:45.000 --> 33:49.000]  2018 will fade into legend and into history.
[33:49.000 --> 33:55.000]  Coming up in about 12 hours on the East Coast.
[33:55.000 --> 34:03.000]  And we'll obviously be covering all the developments as things unfold this evening here at ImpleWars.com and NewsWars.com.
[34:03.000 --> 34:12.000]  But just finishing up what I was saying before I hit more news and take your calls.
[34:12.000 --> 34:20.000]  Any conquering army or culture kills the men down to about age 10 or 11, 12.
[34:20.000 --> 34:25.000]  And in some cultures, they would kill all the men, including baby boys.
[34:25.000 --> 34:33.000]  And any authoritarian regime always targets males in general and puts them into special cast to control them.
[34:33.000 --> 34:44.000]  Everybody knows that women in the sugarcane fields going back 500 years ago in the Caribbean and then starting about 300 years ago in the United States.
[34:44.000 --> 34:46.000]  What is the United States today?
[34:46.000 --> 35:00.000]  That black women were brought in the house and allowed to learn and read in some cases and put in charge of the black men who were kept like animals in straw.
[35:00.000 --> 35:11.000]  So when you see the attack on men and 65% of the college graduates being women and the corporations all saying they're going to put women in charge.
[35:11.000 --> 35:16.000]  And all the video games and all the movies, the men are idiots and the women are experts.
[35:16.000 --> 35:19.000]  That has nothing to do with empowering women.
[35:19.000 --> 35:21.000]  It's in the WikiLeaks.
[35:21.000 --> 35:26.000]  It's in the public documents that it is to destroy this culture.
[35:26.000 --> 35:30.000]  You give men sports, you get them to be arrested development.
[35:30.000 --> 35:33.000]  They act like a bunch of juvenile delinquents.
[35:33.000 --> 35:36.000]  They grovel to the women.
[35:36.000 --> 35:39.000]  The women are not happy with that.
[35:39.000 --> 35:50.000]  And then they become bitter and basically join with the state because the state's promising them that if you just can be at war with men, you're going to have great success.
[35:50.000 --> 36:02.000]  Now, that's the model in the West that's been operative by the leftist that controlled the CIA since 1945 at the end of World War II.
[36:02.000 --> 36:10.000]  Of course, they wanted to have the state raise the children and this is all declassified and they wanted to have women working in the factories and paying taxes.
[36:10.000 --> 36:16.000]  And that's how they sold the general government on it was it's full mobilization for the Cold War.
[36:16.000 --> 36:21.000]  Well, okay, I guess we got to do it and again, I'm not against women that want to be doctors or scientists or astronauts.
[36:21.000 --> 36:22.000]  That's great.
[36:22.000 --> 36:23.000]  I got $3.
[36:23.000 --> 36:40.000]  There's always been women in prominent positions, but the roles were then demonized and Miss Magazine was given $20 million in early 1960s money to be run by Gloria Steinem.
[36:40.000 --> 36:41.000]  This is declassified.
[36:41.000 --> 36:43.000]  She works for the Central Intelligence Agency.
[36:43.000 --> 36:46.000]  Now, she went off and got married and had a bunch of kids.
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  She just taught other women don't do it.
[36:48.000 --> 36:56.000]  Oh, the elites have all got like, you know, the men are total alpha males, the women behind closed doors and wearing dresses totally in those roles.
[36:56.000 --> 36:58.000]  But when they march out to you, they're not.
[36:58.000 --> 37:05.000]  You have to understand they relish hurting you, making sure you die alone women and men.
[37:05.000 --> 37:10.000]  These are hyper aggressive, hyper evil people.
[37:10.000 --> 37:14.000]  And Gloria Steinem, how good it was to get an abortion and how it's, it's fun.
[37:14.000 --> 37:15.000]  And then they have liberals on TV.
[37:15.000 --> 37:16.000]  I got it.
[37:16.000 --> 37:17.000]  I love it.
[37:17.000 --> 37:18.000]  It's fun to kill your babies.
[37:18.000 --> 37:19.000]  Those are actual quotes.
[37:19.000 --> 37:24.000]  That woman get the abortion, you know, on an actress on TV and say, oh, it felt so good.
[37:24.000 --> 37:26.000]  She goes, oh, yeah, it's like sexual pleasure.
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  Remember that few years ago?
[37:28.000 --> 37:32.000]  And then women are taught pouring Drano in their eyes and being blind is wonderful.
[37:32.000 --> 37:36.000]  And the psychologist dumps the Drano in their eyes and they go, it's so beautiful.
[37:36.000 --> 37:40.000]  And the news goes, look, look, she identified as blind.
[37:40.000 --> 37:42.000]  She burned her eyeballs.
[37:42.000 --> 37:48.000]  Oh, by the way, if you're a new viewer, I'm not joking.
[37:48.000 --> 37:50.000]  I'm not joking.
[37:50.000 --> 37:53.000]  It's trans abled.
[37:53.000 --> 37:57.000]  Now used to, you wanted to, you know, gouge your eyeballs out or pour Drano on them.
[37:57.000 --> 38:03.000]  They stuck you in a called a rubber room.
[38:03.000 --> 38:13.000]  Now, oh, the national TV in the UK and the US all just go, oh my God, it's so beautiful.
[38:13.000 --> 38:17.000]  It's so beautiful how you dump Drano in your eyeballs.
[38:17.000 --> 38:20.000]  Oh my God, this is so, so wonderful.
[38:20.000 --> 38:23.000]  You've got so much courage.
[38:23.000 --> 38:24.000]  You're a radio listener.
[38:24.000 --> 38:28.000]  We're actually showing the video to people.
[38:28.000 --> 38:33.000]  Just how much she loved to have it losing her sight. It was so good.
[38:33.000 --> 38:36.000]  I was talking to one of the producers that we probably need to get the audio.
[38:36.000 --> 38:44.000]  Guess what they've been playing on local public radio in Austin for Christmas music.
[38:44.000 --> 38:53.000]  It's crying babies and satanic murder sounds of demons going.
[38:53.000 --> 38:55.000]  Oh, you think I'm joking?
[38:55.000 --> 38:58.000]  You have the recording right here.
[38:58.000 --> 39:03.000]  But to give us the folks for the show, pull this up for you.
[39:03.000 --> 39:29.000]  This is this is Christmas music holiday music here on so called public radio.
[39:29.000 --> 39:45.000]  That's the music they play with their kids.
[39:45.000 --> 39:47.000]  Corrupt the child.
[39:47.000 --> 39:53.000]  Kill them all.
[39:53.000 --> 40:00.000]  This is their revolution time. They're coming for you and your family.
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.000]  Oh, but see China didn't do that model.
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  They said no.
[40:04.000 --> 40:05.000]  They worked with the West to do it.
[40:05.000 --> 40:06.000]  It was all in big agreements.
[40:06.000 --> 40:14.000]  They got Western funding to kill vast majority of little girls when they're born.
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  So you get 50 million.
[40:16.000 --> 40:17.000]  That's the latest number.
[40:17.000 --> 40:19.000]  50 million girls that were killed.
[40:19.000 --> 40:22.000]  Oh, but see how feminist that is.
[40:22.000 --> 40:28.000]  Like all the woman empowerment now women, you know, out there debasing themselves everywhere.
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  Studies show women have never been more unhappy.
[40:30.000 --> 40:33.000]  But see, it's okay because the globalists are doing it for you and your family.
[40:33.000 --> 40:36.000]  But they're trying to get rid of.
[40:36.000 --> 40:39.000]  But see, there's a group not doing that.
[40:39.000 --> 40:42.000]  And who are they?
[40:42.000 --> 40:46.000]  It's the largest country in the world.
[40:46.000 --> 40:50.000]  And it's only 200 million people.
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.000]  And it's got its problems.
[40:52.000 --> 40:55.000]  But they're into men being men and women being women.
[40:55.000 --> 41:07.000]  And they teach in mainline college and mainline high school and on the national news that the western globalist are trying to destroy the family and trying to overrun Europe with with with Islamist and breaking down the borders.
[41:07.000 --> 41:13.000]  They're trying to do it to Russia and Russia said, we're not going to chemically lobotomize five year olds.
[41:13.000 --> 41:18.000]  And if anyone tries to teach a boy that he's really a girl, that's that's that's child endangerment.
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  You're going to arrest your ass.
[41:20.000 --> 41:29.000]  Just like used to, I guess in a park of an adult walked over to somebody's kid and said to little boy, you know, let's talk about your genitals and how we could cut them off.
[41:29.000 --> 41:31.000]  You'd say, oh my God, that's a pervert.
[41:31.000 --> 41:32.000]  Oh, not today.
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  Oh, thank you.
[41:34.000 --> 41:39.000]  Well, the Russians have said over our dead body.
[41:39.000 --> 41:47.000]  And the globalists said, if you let one country stand up, they might all stand up and suddenly from Brazil to the UK to the US, it's happening.
[41:47.000 --> 41:49.000]  And people are saying, we're done.
[41:49.000 --> 41:50.000]  They're reading the textbooks.
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  They're reading what the globalists say.
[41:52.000 --> 41:59.000]  And man, when you go out and protest globalist, demonic, shatanic methods show up that are professors.
[41:59.000 --> 42:04.000]  And they literally on video say, and they're not joking just to freak you out because they know you're a Christian.
[42:04.000 --> 42:09.000]  They go, I love Satan and I have killed over 20 of my own children.
[42:09.000 --> 42:12.000]  We wait till the ninth prime minister and dedicated to Satan.
[42:12.000 --> 42:16.000]  I killed my children and I'm going to tell you.
[42:16.000 --> 42:19.000]  And then there's just be like 20 of the women online.
[42:19.000 --> 42:21.000]  And that's who they are.
[42:21.000 --> 42:29.000]  And your children, they believe belong to them.
[42:29.000 --> 42:31.000]  Now, that's the that's the anti-povangar.
[42:31.000 --> 42:38.000]  Then you've got the poor little boy that they have dancing, you know, at the gay bars who talks about how he uses ketamine.
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  And nobody gets in trouble for that.
[42:40.000 --> 42:48.000]  And then public school events where men come and shake their butts in front of little children and they stick $5 bills in their G-Streams.
[42:48.000 --> 42:54.000]  It's just the whole Nambla train running America over.
[42:54.000 --> 42:58.000]  Your phone calls are coming up the Dan Lyman from the EU.
[42:58.000 --> 43:06.000]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it,
[43:06.000 --> 43:11.000]  that it lowers IQ, it literally dumps the population down.
[43:11.000 --> 43:17.000]  And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers, the best iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations.
[43:17.000 --> 43:24.000]  First, seaweed-based iodine that was pretty good but hard to source and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[43:24.000 --> 43:29.000]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought you X2.
[43:29.000 --> 43:30.000]  That's been incredible.
[43:30.000 --> 43:37.000]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the deep earth crystals of nascent iodine.
[43:37.000 --> 43:46.000]  But chemists, scientists and others showed us the research that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C,
[43:46.000 --> 43:51.000]  it supercharges it and makes it even more bioavailable.
[43:51.000 --> 43:55.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it, you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery.
[43:55.000 --> 44:00.000]  X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[44:25.000 --> 44:28.000]  And I want you to have storeable food so it's a total win-win.
[44:28.000 --> 44:32.000]  We have those incredible sell prices back at m4store.com.
[44:32.000 --> 44:34.000]  On m4, select storeable foods.
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  They've got special diet foods.
[44:36.000 --> 44:40.000]  They've got three month supplies, year supplies, week emergency supplies.
[44:40.000 --> 44:42.000]  They've got so many great products there.
[44:42.000 --> 44:43.000]  Maybe you got a three year supply.
[44:43.000 --> 44:45.000]  If stuff happens, you can feed your whole block.
[44:45.000 --> 44:48.000]  It's up to us to be self-sufficient.
[44:48.000 --> 44:51.000]  You're buying war bonds, bringing great products together.
[44:51.000 --> 44:53.000]  With God's help, we are unstoppable.
[44:53.000 --> 45:00.000]  At m4store.com, at m4 select, high-quality storeable foods powered by my Patreon supply.
[45:00.000 --> 45:05.000]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[45:05.000 --> 45:12.000]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact that the emperor has no close,
[45:12.000 --> 45:15.000]  they can call BS, it's game over.
[45:15.000 --> 45:20.000]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity,
[45:20.000 --> 45:24.000]  they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[45:24.000 --> 45:27.000]  There's only two groups in the U.S.
[45:27.000 --> 45:32.000]  Infowars and Matt Rudge of rudgereport.com that are truly independent.
[45:32.000 --> 45:35.000]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[45:35.000 --> 45:37.000]  It really is amazing.
[45:37.000 --> 45:42.000]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in
[45:42.000 --> 45:44.000]  and how far we've come together.
[45:44.000 --> 45:49.000]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of Infowars.
[45:49.000 --> 45:54.000]  So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswars.com, prismpana.com,
[45:54.000 --> 45:57.000]  because if you don't spread the articles and the videos, no one else will.
[45:57.000 --> 46:00.000]  We're all in each other's hands. God bless you all and thank you.
[46:00.000 --> 46:05.000]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[46:05.000 --> 46:07.000]  That's the globalist only hope.
[46:07.000 --> 46:10.000]  So when you support Infowars, when you spread our articles and videos,
[46:10.000 --> 46:15.000]  when you buy products at infowarsstore.com, you are literally not just supporting Infowars in free speech
[46:15.000 --> 46:19.000]  and standing in defiance against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people,
[46:19.000 --> 46:25.000]  but you are standing for your own future and your own best shot of having an early warning system in America
[46:25.000 --> 46:27.000]  to stand against these individuals.
[46:27.000 --> 46:31.000]  When you order products at infowarsstore.com, you fund not just an American revolution,
[46:31.000 --> 46:33.000]  but a global revolution against tyranny.
[46:33.000 --> 46:36.000]  And we have the biggest specials ever running throughout to the end of the year
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.000]  as part of a total store clearance.
[46:38.000 --> 46:41.000]  Every order gets a free t-shirt.
[46:41.000 --> 46:42.000]  Every order gets free shipping.
[46:42.000 --> 46:45.000]  Every order gets 50% to 75% off in total clearance.
[46:45.000 --> 46:49.000]  And that funding allows us to go into the new year on sure footing
[46:49.000 --> 46:54.000]  to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year to not just fight, but to expand.
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[46:56.000 --> 46:57.000]  I salute you all.
[46:57.000 --> 47:13.000]  Now please take action at infowarsstore.com.
[47:27.000 --> 47:28.000]  So does he.
[47:28.000 --> 47:31.000]  Live from Austin, Texas.
[47:31.000 --> 47:33.000]  Broadcasting Worldwide.
[47:33.000 --> 47:36.000]  It's Alex Jones.
[47:36.000 --> 47:40.000]  By the way, remember the amazing Desmond that they teach school kids about all over the country?
[47:40.000 --> 47:43.000]  He was from New York.
[47:43.000 --> 47:47.000]  Since he was like eight years old, he's been on national TV as a trans kid.
[47:47.000 --> 47:50.000]  He dances at gay strip bars.
[47:50.000 --> 47:54.000]  And the police don't come because it's liberal, so it's okay.
[47:54.000 --> 48:02.000]  He talked about LGBT, the pedophilia, and about taking ketamine in a video we played two weeks ago.
[48:02.000 --> 48:10.000]  Coming up next hour, another video that we just found of him with adult gay men looking completely drugged out of his mind
[48:10.000 --> 48:14.000]  with signs behind him talking about taking roofies.
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  That's the date rape drug.
[48:16.000 --> 48:19.000]  I mean, this poor child.
[48:19.000 --> 48:23.000]  This needs to be investigated immediately.
[48:23.000 --> 48:25.000]  So we'll get to that next hour.
[48:25.000 --> 48:27.000]  I want to start going to your calls.
[48:27.000 --> 48:31.000]  Then about 20 after Dan Lyman is going to join us for a couple of segments.
[48:31.000 --> 48:39.000]  Our EuropeWars.com reporter doing a great job over there on how they're fighting back against the globalists.
[48:39.000 --> 48:42.000]  They're taking down EU flags all over Europe.
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  They're storming parliaments.
[48:44.000 --> 48:45.000]  They're storming capitals.
[48:45.000 --> 48:50.000]  They're storming elite vacation islands that Macron's on.
[48:50.000 --> 48:53.000]  Top generals are saying he should be arrested for treason.
[48:53.000 --> 48:59.000]  It's on, like Donkey Kong, as they say.
[48:59.000 --> 49:00.000]  So we're on the march.
[49:00.000 --> 49:09.000]  The globalists are on the run, and they admit that 2018's biggest losers was the New World Order, the global liberal order.
[49:09.000 --> 49:14.000]  That's going to teach your kids how to have sex when they're three years old.
[49:14.000 --> 49:19.000]  These people are going for broke, but they're striking back with total censorship and intimidation against those of us
[49:19.000 --> 49:24.000]  that are in the anti-globalist leadership.
[49:24.000 --> 49:29.000]  That's why I cannot stress enough how we need your prayers first and foremost, and we need your support.
[49:29.000 --> 49:36.000]  And by the way, I got this news right before the broadcast started, but I wanted to get more details, and I do have more details now.
[49:36.000 --> 49:45.000]  David Knight suffered Saturday night a pretty serious heart attack,
[49:45.000 --> 49:55.000]  and he had several procedures done today at 5 a.m., and he got out of surgery and then came out and was stabilized by about 10.30.
[49:55.000 --> 49:57.000]  And we had a chance to talk to the family right before I went on air.
[49:57.000 --> 49:58.000]  I've talked to him more now.
[49:58.000 --> 50:01.000]  And the host of the David Knight Show, weekday mornings, 8 a.m.
[50:01.000 --> 50:03.000]  He's worked with him for almost eight years.
[50:03.000 --> 50:05.000]  He's a treasure.
[50:05.000 --> 50:09.000]  Super smart engineer, patriot.
[50:09.000 --> 50:15.000]  And we hope he gets back in the saddle as soon as possible.
[50:15.000 --> 50:19.000]  But that is certainly prayers are answered there.
[50:19.000 --> 50:22.000]  He's not completely out of the woods, but he's part way out of the woods.
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  So that is certainly great news to everybody.
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  Thank you for your prayers for David Knight.
[50:26.000 --> 50:31.000]  Really, really appreciate that.
[50:31.000 --> 50:36.000]  I know Owen hosted his show this morning, and I think we're going to have a round table of host until David's back.
[50:36.000 --> 50:39.000]  I know David's going to want to come back.
[50:39.000 --> 50:51.000]  Obviously, I'm going to make him take off some serious, serious time because it's just something that's got to be done.
[50:51.000 --> 50:58.000]  Now, I want to hit the border a little bit and then go to break.
[50:58.000 --> 51:05.000]  Come back with your calls.
[51:05.000 --> 51:10.000]  The global crime cartel is using culture war to break down society,
[51:10.000 --> 51:13.000]  deindustrialization to destroy independence,
[51:13.000 --> 51:17.000]  computerization and automation with robots,
[51:17.000 --> 51:22.000]  not to empower humanity, but to remove us from the decision making process
[51:22.000 --> 51:28.000]  so the globalists have full technocratic, technotronic, technocracy power
[51:28.000 --> 51:30.000]  and their own admissions.
[51:30.000 --> 51:36.000]  So they're building a world where we're obsolete and where they can dictate total control over us.
[51:36.000 --> 51:39.000]  It's a breakaway civilization move.
[51:39.000 --> 51:49.000]  The other spear on the fork of deindustrialization and of Balkanization,
[51:49.000 --> 52:00.000]  divide and conquer, is flooding the nation states with the lowest IQ, most criminal, stupidest people from the third world,
[52:00.000 --> 52:05.000]  not the good people from the third world, and then weaponizing them politically once they get here,
[52:05.000 --> 52:08.000]  and everyone knows that.
[52:08.000 --> 52:12.000]  Mexico has the highest crime rate in the world,
[52:12.000 --> 52:16.000]  200,000 people killed the last decade, hundreds of thousands missing,
[52:16.000 --> 52:24.000]  and so we have serious Mexican mafia, MS-13, people that don't care about getting killed,
[52:24.000 --> 52:29.000]  pouring in, human smuggling children, even the Washington Post had to admit that.
[52:29.000 --> 52:36.000]  And so now you have this illegal alien who shoots this police officer who happened to be Hispanic,
[52:36.000 --> 52:39.000]  and so the left's having a problem because when a white cop gets killed,
[52:39.000 --> 52:41.000]  they literally in the news say he deserves it,
[52:41.000 --> 52:49.000]  or a white woman gets shot in the back by the illegal aliens, the media says it's okay and the jury lets the guy go.
[52:49.000 --> 52:53.000]  But because this is a good-looking Hispanic cop with a good record that got killed,
[52:53.000 --> 52:58.000]  it's a poster child for how half the country is going to be Hispanic in just a decade,
[52:58.000 --> 53:00.000]  and most areas it already is, it's your country.
[53:00.000 --> 53:04.000]  So trying to make it a race war or bring in the worst criminals in Mexico,
[53:04.000 --> 53:07.000]  that's mainly going to kill Hispanic people, and Hispanic folks know that.
[53:07.000 --> 53:10.000]  But the controlled media tries to say it's all racial.
[53:10.000 --> 53:14.000]  No, we don't want the worst people out of Mexico.
[53:14.000 --> 53:17.000]  And almost every time I hear about a cop getting shot at or killed,
[53:17.000 --> 53:20.000]  a week later they released the dash cam footage,
[53:20.000 --> 53:26.000]  and it's some crazy MS-13 dude just, cop pulls you over, try to kill him.
[53:26.000 --> 53:32.000]  And so you watch the sheriff there in California in this county breaking down and crying from Friday,
[53:32.000 --> 53:35.000]  and we aired it over the weekend, but I want to go ahead and play this,
[53:35.000 --> 53:39.000]  because remember Nancy Pelosi said MS-13 are good people.
[53:39.000 --> 53:41.000]  We're all God's children.
[53:41.000 --> 53:46.000]  And that's because in many areas the Democrats are using them as hit men.
[53:46.000 --> 53:52.000]  Now I've been told this by the FBI, by the CIA, by the Department of Defense five years ago,
[53:52.000 --> 53:54.000]  that Obama was using them.
[53:54.000 --> 53:58.000]  Now it's come out in the news that Democrats locally are using them as their muscle,
[53:58.000 --> 54:02.000]  because you can just say to a lawyer, an immigration lawyer,
[54:02.000 --> 54:08.000]  oh, this person is we dealt with, and then MS-13 gets a message from one of their leaders,
[54:08.000 --> 54:13.000]  or one of the other mafia groups, and they kill you, just like Mexico,
[54:13.000 --> 54:18.000]  or Nicaragua, or El Salvador, or Guatemala.
[54:18.000 --> 54:24.000]  So MS-13 and these different Latin gangs are the muscle of the Democratic Party,
[54:24.000 --> 54:29.000]  and now they're using Chinese gangs as the muscle against Asians.
[54:29.000 --> 54:32.000]  The Democrats are a criminal group, man.
[54:32.000 --> 54:37.000]  James O'Keeffe can't walk in any Democrat office.
[54:37.000 --> 54:41.000]  They can't walk in any Democrat office and say, I'm running sex slaves.
[54:41.000 --> 54:42.000]  Good, we'll help you.
[54:42.000 --> 54:43.000]  I'm going to steal votes.
[54:43.000 --> 54:44.000]  Good, we're going to help you.
[54:44.000 --> 54:49.000]  Go and beat an O'Rourke's campaign, how they're bringing in smuggled caravan people.
[54:49.000 --> 54:51.000]  This is what they do.
[54:51.000 --> 54:52.000]  That's who they are.
[54:52.000 --> 54:56.000]  They're the mafia.
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  And they want to break this country completely.
[54:58.000 --> 55:03.000]  So here's a piece from Fox earlier with the sheriff talking about what really happened.
[55:03.000 --> 55:09.000]  He's sharing any information with federal immigration authorities that is not available to the general public.
[55:09.000 --> 55:13.000]  Here's Stanislaus County Sheriff Adam Christensen.
[55:13.000 --> 55:15.000]  Of course it's being politicized.
[55:15.000 --> 55:19.000]  The last thing in the world I want to do is politicize the death of Officer Singh.
[55:19.000 --> 55:24.000]  But let's go back to Ron, an immigrant.
[55:24.000 --> 55:29.000]  Immigrated here lawfully and legally to pursue his American dream.
[55:29.000 --> 55:32.000]  He achieved that goal.
[55:32.000 --> 55:35.000]  And his dream was taken from him.
[55:35.000 --> 55:37.000]  No, we shouldn't politicize it.
[55:37.000 --> 55:46.000]  But we have to have a conversation about restrictive legislation that puts our communities at risk.
[55:46.000 --> 55:50.000]  California Governor Jerry Brown spokesman issuing a statement saying, quote,
[55:50.000 --> 55:56.000]  California law fully permits the sharing of information on dangerous gang members.
[55:56.000 --> 55:57.000]  Stop right there.
[55:57.000 --> 56:02.000]  No, they don't. And neither do the mayors of places like Oakland and San Francisco.
[56:02.000 --> 56:08.000]  They tell the MS 13 dens when ice is coming.
[56:08.000 --> 56:17.000]  To the point where federal law enforcement can't even tell these cities and counties that are sanctuary cities over 900 of them that they're coming or they'll be people waiting to shoot them.
[56:17.000 --> 56:23.000]  The answer is cutting all federal funds off from sanctuary cities period.
[56:23.000 --> 56:30.000]  The answer is cutting USA ID funding completely for refugee programs because these are not refugee programs.
[56:30.000 --> 56:36.000]  These have been weaponized against our nations and admitted globalist plan.
[56:36.000 --> 56:40.000]  They are a pack of criminals and I'm not talking about the illegal aliens.
[56:40.000 --> 56:45.000]  Most of the people trying to get here illegally are just desperately poor fleeing the hell they were in.
[56:45.000 --> 56:51.000]  But they're bringing it with them folks and diseases and everything else.
[56:51.000 --> 56:53.000]  By the way, this is the last day.
[56:53.000 --> 56:54.000]  It makes it until tomorrow.
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  But we're almost sold out of everything.
[56:56.000 --> 56:57.000]  X two.
[56:57.000 --> 56:59.000]  We're almost sold out of the original X two.
[56:59.000 --> 57:01.000]  We're almost sold out a brain force plus.
[57:01.000 --> 57:04.000]  We're almost sold out a body's ultimate turmeric formula.
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  We're almost sold out a super blue fluoride free toothpaste.
[57:06.000 --> 57:10.000]  We're almost sold out of more than 30 best selling items.
[57:10.000 --> 57:14.000]  All the t shirts and extra large and larger sold out to stop the free t shirt deal.
[57:14.000 --> 57:20.000]  Now it's a free gift store wide free shipping 50 to 75% off double patriot points on your next order.
[57:20.000 --> 57:23.000]  And a free gift with every order.
[57:23.000 --> 57:28.000]  Total clearance by the end of the year is we don't pay inventory tax.
[57:28.000 --> 57:29.000]  It's been a success.
[57:29.000 --> 57:30.000]  Thanks to all of you.

[57:31.000 --> 57:36.000]  You helped fund the info war and battle the globalist and you helped info wars.
[57:36.000 --> 57:37.000]  What a great job.
[57:37.000 --> 57:39.000]  You got great products at the same time.

[57:47.000 --> 57:49.000]  Your calls coming up.
[57:49.000 --> 57:54.000]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  That's the globalist only hope.
[57:56.000 --> 58:01.000]  So when you support info wars, when you spread our articles and videos, when you buy products at infowarstore.com,

[58:34.000 --> 58:43.000]  And that funding allows us to go into the new year on sure footing to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year to not just fight, but to expand.
[58:43.000 --> 58:45.000]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[58:45.000 --> 58:46.000]  I salute you all.

[59:52.000 --> 01:00:17.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:24.000]  Okay, thank you so much for joining us on the final global transmission of the Alex Jones show for 2018.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:27.000]  I'm going to go to your calls for the next three segments.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.000]  And then Dan Lyman's going to be joining me, our EuropeWars.com main correspondent.
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000]  He's had a few other guys he works with over there.
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:40.000]  Covers Davos, covers the Yellow Vests, just a big developments on that front coming up.
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:43.000]  And a lot of other news obviously haven't gotten into yet.
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:48.000]  Accelerating their censorship now against Franklin Graham, Pocahontas.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000]  The fraud has announced what she's going to be doing.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:54.000]  This is all scripted by the Democrats. I'll break that down.
[01:00:54.000 --> 01:00:59.000]  There is so much more we're going to be getting to, but a lot of positive things happen this year as well.
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:05.000]  I'm going to be talking about obviously two good Supreme Court justices compared to what Hillary would do.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:07.000]  Excellent compared to what she would have done.
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:12.000]  Now they're freaking out over Ruth Bader Ginsburg and confirmation in the Senate.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000]  Because Trump has even stronger hand there now.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:19.000]  But they're warming up with 84 investigations that Democrats have announced.
[01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:23.000]  When they go back into Congress in three days, they're going to be launching.
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:27.000]  It is going to be crazy town.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  And I've got Michael Moore coming up saying you can't wait to see the Trumps in orange jumpsuits.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.000]  Oh, but of course, not for any Russiagate.
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  But for claiming that they knew Michael Cohen was doing something wrong.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  I mean, there's nothing there, but they're busting every lawyer that Trump uses in different cities for things those lawyers have done.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  So the lawyers then turn state's evidence against Trump and make something up.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  It's very elementary.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:01.000]  The old fashioned process of we're going to bust you unless you're an informant on this person.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  And by the way, you better find something.
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  The San Quentin's not a good place to be.
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  And then you've got Mueller destroying evidence.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  All these people are criminals.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.000]  And everyone just shakes in their boots out of all these sick events.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  They've basically destroyed our culture and our society.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000]  And somebody's got to stand up to these people.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  I know as a death to find life I lead, I take my chances.
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:31.000]  But I don't do it to, you know, make my money and be on TV like the fall guy, Lee Majors.
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  Like that show when I was a kid.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:37.000]  I do it so my children will have a future.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:43.000]  Though we should probably come in with the fall guy next segment.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  If we can do that.
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  But right now let's go ahead and go to the first call here.
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  Let's go to Wild Man in Illinois.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  Thanks for holding and about to say Happy New Year.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:59.000]  Go ahead.
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  Alex, welcome.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  Yeah, going into 2019.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:07.000]  What Trump's got to do to save America.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:09.000]  He's got a D class 5 visa.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.000]  Expose the corruption.
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  Arrest the traders and arrest the pedophiles.
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  That's how he saves America.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:19.000]  My opinion and over the road trucker hardworking honest man.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  That's what I believe.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:21.000]  I agree.
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  Victory or death.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  He's now looks like he's cleaning house.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  He's getting rid of all the double agents and the word is Trump is going to go into battle now.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000]  We're talking he's going to strike back against the censorship.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:33.000]  He's going to strike back against the pedophile rings.
[01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  It's already begun.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  He's going to strike back against the deep state.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:41.000]  He's going to strike back against all the criminal activity of Comey and Mueller being Russian operatives.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:45.000]  So just get ready.
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000]  I'd say another note.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  I've spent over $3,000 in your store this year.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  I'm a loyal supporter and thanks for great products.
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:54.000]  Brother, let me tell you something.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:57.000]  I want to thank you if you if folks like you didn't stand with us.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:03:59.000]  They're taking Michael Savage off the air.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:01.000]  They're taking everybody.
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:03.000]  They took Franklin Graham off Facebook.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:04.000]  They're there.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:07.000]  They need to get us all off the air before they make their move on Trump.
[01:04:07.000 --> 01:04:09.000]  That's why this is a war.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:11.000]  And you supporting us is incredible.
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:13.000]  Which products do you like the best?
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]  Man, I use the bodies.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:17.000]  I got so many t-shirts.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:18.000]  It ain't even funny.
[01:04:18.000 --> 01:04:21.000]  I got your stickers posted on my hard hat on my gps.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:23.000]  I got my t-shirts on my t-shirts.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]  I got my t-shirts on my t-shirts.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:28.000]  I posted on my hard hat on my gps, my truck.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.000]  I tell truckers about you over the CB Airways all across the country.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:34.000]  I spread the word about you.
[01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:37.000]  I wear your clothes, your hats, your shirts, you name it.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:40.000]  I've a multitude of products.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:45.000]  How much love do you get versus how much love versus hate do you get?
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:48.000]  You know, it's a people's skeptical.
[01:04:48.000 --> 01:04:54.000]  But like it's probably about 50-50 or 60-40 year way.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:57.000]  It's just so many people got their head in the sand out here.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000]  God bless you.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:03.000]  As the years go by, it gets harder and harder to keep up with your body's nutritional needs.
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:06.000]  With changes in diet, unnatural ingredients, and stress,
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:12.000]  you may not be able to get all the necessary nutrients, amino acids, vitamins, and minerals needed daily.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:17.000]  That's why Infowars Life created the powerful vitamin mineral fusion formula.

[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:26.000]  So we're taking phone calls on what you think of 2018 and what you think has come up in 2019.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:29.000]  The first call we took made a great point.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:35.000]  Trump has to get on the offense and go after the whole criminal deep state,
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.000]  the illegal FISA warrant, the illegal investigation of him,
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:42.000]  the perjury to Congress by Mueller and by Comey, caught red-handed,
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000]  the destruction of evidence by Mueller.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000]  They have to go on the offense.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:51.000]  Here Giuliani's saying that now, that means they're getting ready to do it,
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:54.000]  which means the deep state's going to be very, very dangerous right now.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.000]  China says they're getting ready to make a deal with Trump so the stock market's up.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000]  Democrats have 84 investigations.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  They're getting ready to launch in three days when they take control of the house.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:11.000]  Pocahontas with, wow,.0007% Native American.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:19.000]  They say one of the widest people in the world, she is running.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:23.000]  And it's all how she's going to fight them big bankers in the New World Order,
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:27.000]  the globalist, when every one of her policies is what they want.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  So that's amazing.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000]  But Bernie will play the part of the Communist.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  She'll play the part of the moderate and pull the Democrats even further to the left.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  So that's all coming up as well.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:41.000]  But right now, let's go back to your phone calls.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:46.000]  Let's go back to your phone calls and let's talk to Kyle in Arizona.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000]  Kyle, welcome and thanks for calling.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000]  Hey, how you doing, brother?
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:51.000]  Good, my friend.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:55.000]  Hey, yeah, just a new, new listener, my wife's an Advent Lister,
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000]  and it's amazing here in 2018, the censorship.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:01.000]  I'm a Christian trying to spread the word of God,
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:03.000]  and I can just see how they're trying to get rid of Christians,
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:05.000]  and it's really scary.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:10.000]  Well, sir, I mean, anyone with American flags, anyone promoting even mainline churches
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:12.000]  has been getting banned on Twitter and Facebook.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000]  I've talked about it.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:21.000]  Now, Franklin Graham was removed by one of the quote fact checkers for dehumanization,
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:25.000]  for defending the family from a two-year-old post,
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:29.000]  and Franklin Graham has said that it was a personal attack towards him.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:35.000]  Now, Facebook's backed off because he leads 50 million people listening to him,
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  but that's why we need to get all of the Christian churches involved here
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:49.000]  to defend free speech, because the First Amendment has the freedom of religion in it as well.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  Wow, I know.
[01:08:50.000 --> 01:08:53.000]  It's incredible, and it's scary at the same time.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:57.000]  You know, like just hearing it and seeing the censorship,
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:01.000]  instead of with Graham and everything, and it's really scary as I start to watch and listen
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:05.000]  and look into everything on your uninfluores, and how true it is,
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000]  and trying to block you out and everything, and just definitely praying for you
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]  and praying for everyone, including David Knight,
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  because it's scary how they're trying to shut everything down.
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  Well, Michael Savage is in a contract, so he can't talk about it,
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:21.000]  but he has the number one show in the country in his slot,
[01:09:21.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  and they're taking a show from three hours to one hour,
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  giving it to a guy that's never been in talk radio and has no ratings,
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  Mr. Shapiro, and it's all because he's pro-Trump,
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  and everyone's getting told you become anti-Trump or you're going to be off the air.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  And the only people that are not going along with this are myself,
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  Matt Drudge, Sean Hannity, Tucker Carlson,
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  but I can tell you from behind the scenes things I know about people at Fox,
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000]  and I wasn't given this by Tucker or by anybody else,
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000]  people that were in the room though, they've all been threatened with being fired and stuff
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:58.000]  if they don't start becoming anti-Trump.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:03.000]  And so, when Fox News is doing that, you know we're two minutes to midnight,
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  and that's why they want to remove everybody off of social media
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:11.000]  so that things can't spread virally before they make their move on Trump.
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000]  God bless you, Kyle, I appreciate your call.
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:19.000]  Trump must take action, we must all take action against the censors.
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000]  It's outrageous. And again, first they demonized me for two years,
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  lying about who I was, so that when they banned me, it would sound legitimate
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000]  and people wouldn't say it was wrong.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  When the majority didn't say it was wrong, first they came for Alex Jones,
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  then they came for Franklin Graham. They're coming for everyone.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:44.000]  And almost no one works for themselves.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:51.000]  Almost no one except Matt Rudge and myself have their own platform, their own syndication, their own system.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  No one else is truly independent.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:11:01.000]  They're good people, Sean Hannity and others, but they can be taken off by their syndicator or by Fox.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  That's why Michael Savage is being taken off because he is in a syndicator.
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:10.000]  So, it's on.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:15.000]  And they have brigades of corporate fake media CNN working behind the scenes
[01:11:15.000 --> 01:11:19.000]  with the Democratic Party and the government and corporations to take people off the air.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  This is a concerted takeover in the U.S.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  We're in a war and they do two things to me and then I'll go to your calls.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:29.000]  They just keep saying, Jones admits he's an actor.
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:31.000]  Jones admits he's fake. Did you hear?
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  Jones said he didn't believe any of it.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:37.000]  There's never a tape. There's never a video.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  They just say it on every channel every day.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  I mean, it's everywhere.
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:47.000]  People walk up and they go, oh, so you admit you're a fake, you piece of crap.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.000]  Oh, yeah, I'm real fake being demonized and attacked everywhere and telling you Trump would win
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  and we'd fight back against world government and, you know, there's giant pedophile rings running everything and it's all.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:12:01.000]  No, I'm over the target and I'm not like even happy about that.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  I'm like, oh, I'm over the target. I'm the tough guys will do this.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:13.000]  I'm freaked out that most men I know only care about their Porsche or playing golf and how much sex they can have.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  And a lot of them are stronger than I am, better looking than I am, but they don't have any spirit.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  And it's like, what is the point? Why are you even having children?
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:27.000]  But they love to go to Gala's and stand out and everyone admire them.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:35.000]  They're not real people. They're not real people.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:39.000]  And they're going to lose everything.
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:43.000]  All the trendies, all the yuppies, all of you.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  No, not Joe Rogan. He's, you know, Joe's an entertainer and Joe, you know, blue collar guy from Boston, you know,
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:57.000]  wants to be successful is successful.
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  And Joe's a good guy. He's chosen his, his, his road. I've chosen mine.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  I'm proud to be on my road, not compromised and not backing down.
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:09.000]  The only the crew put Joe on screen since you bring up Joe.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  Here's the only thing I'm going to say about it. I ought to make a statement to him at some point.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:19.000]  I've talked to him and I've left him messages and we've talked back and forth on text and I've talked to him on the phone.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:27.000]  And I just said, just stop saying the, the Soros line that I won't stop harassing Sandy Hook parents or going to their houses
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:33.000]  or that I say nobody died because for years I haven't said that and I never sent anybody to their houses.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:39.000]  And it's the thing the media puts out there out of everything I've done to make me sound like I'm a bad guy.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:45.000]  So if you're not going to have me on, that's fine. Just stop saying the talking points, but he won't.
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:57.000]  It's George Soros is a hero. We're a war to fought the Nazis. Barely survived. He's a war hero. Alex Jones won't stop being mean to Sandy Hook parents.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000]  You know, and it's just like, wow, so you're not just not going to have me on.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:12.000]  You're so I could defend myself to a larger platform of liberals, but you're going to then keep putting out the line because it's the same line over and over again.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  He sent a guy with a gun to a pizza place to kill people because pedophilia doesn't exist. That's the cover story for all that.
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:27.000]  And he blah, blah, blah is being mean to the Sandy Hook parents and sending people to their houses. None of that's true.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  I mean, Megan Kelly before she left Fox aired audio of video where I said Hillary's responsible for killing hundreds of thousands of people, tens of thousands of women and children in the Arab Spring.
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:43.000]  She funded. They edited it and said that I said Hillary was doing that in the pizza place.
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  Now, I should have sued Fox and Megan Kelly at that time.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:53.000]  And the statute of limitations is up, but I think we can transfer it forward and we're looking at doing it, but I just get so busy.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  I haven't yet, but I can't even get on any big platform other than mine to show that.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  In fact, they took my YouTube down with billions of years where I showed the original video of what I said versus what she did.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:14.000]  So, see, that's the thing. That's what sucks is being partially tied up and like, hey, Joe, I've known you for 18, 19 years.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  You know, we buddies, we partied together. Can you help me? Just at least say I didn't say this.
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  Joe's like, no, man, I ain't saying it. In fact, I'm going to say their talking point. I'm going to shoot another arrow in your gut.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  So that's fine. I say, I like it because I'm an American and I'm not backing down and I'm not scared.
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:42.000]  And I'm not selling out for not 30 pieces or 300 pieces or 33 trillion pieces of silver.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:50.000]  I'm not afraid of losing everything, including my life for the truth. I'm double down. I'm the real deal.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  I'm not a fake tough guy. I'm just a man standing up for my family.
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and Lung Delivery System at SilverLungs.com. That's SilverLungs.com.

[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:29.000]  and understand how real this fight is and why we've been made the main target
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:35.000]  and if you financially support us and if you spread the word about our articles and videos at m4s.com
[01:18:35.000 --> 01:18:40.000]  we won't just continue to stand up against these brutal scumbags. We'll win.
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000]  We have huge sales at m4s.com right now.

[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:54.000]  But if you don't stand up and support us financially, Sorrelstead Global is going to win.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:58.000]  This is m4s.com. We're your support. I'm counting on you.
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:19:03.000]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember this life is a test.
[01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:09.000]  And those of you that have been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and Christianity
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:15.000]  coming back from the dead and recognizing it's being persecuted, that's all because you are the core.
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:25.000]  Listening to m4s around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:33.000]  Everybody knows who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians who tend to be immune to the globalist brainwashing
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:37.000]  and who tend to see it. And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:42.000]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying. 2018 has been insane.
[01:19:42.000 --> 01:19:49.000]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:53.000]  Not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists.
[01:19:53.000 --> 01:20:08.000]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute you.
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:36.000]  Dan Lyman, head of EuropeWars.com with incredible breaking news, joins us in the next two segments.
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:41.000]  I'm going to keep going to your phone calls now and then calls into the next hour.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:49.000]  You know, I was not talking about Joe Rogan earlier when the guys flashed him up on screen, but they do that as a joke to see if I'd go off on him.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:52.000]  And I'm not even mad at Joe.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:21:00.000]  I am mad at Michael Savage being taken off the air with top ratings and being replaced with a neocon.
[01:21:00.000 --> 01:21:10.000]  I am mad at the total takeover and firing of Gavin McGinnis who was number one on CRTV and every day and now Franklin Graham off Facebook.
[01:21:10.000 --> 01:21:15.000]  They're coming for everyone's speech. It's criminal.
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:24.000]  And then to see Joe and others to protect themselves, go with the talking points against me.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:30.000]  Once they've gotten everybody else off the air, they're going to make Joe sing to whatever sheet of music they want as well.
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:33.000]  They already basically do.
[01:21:33.000 --> 01:21:37.000]  And so it's not like I'm even mad. It's like losing somebody.
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:40.000]  It's like somebody died.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:46.000]  I mean, Howard Stern, the king of free speech.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:51.000]  And then he says the talking points and says, yeah, Alex Jones has got to be taken off the air.
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:55.000]  He says, you know, nobody died at Sandy Hook. He's harassing the parents, which isn't true.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:59.000]  I'm not harassing the parents. None of that's true. The Internet didn't buy some of it.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:08.000]  We have a right to question things with babies and incubators that didn't die to launch the Iraq war and wag the dog scenarios and all the rest of it.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:12.000]  I mean, you see stuff in the news all the time where you catch groups from organizations staging things.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:15.000]  You can't trust the media. People have a right to question.
[01:22:15.000 --> 01:22:23.000]  But just take that thing and then use it to ban me on the Internet and then start banning everybody else.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:29.000]  And everybody's proud because, well, we're still on the Internet because we played ball. It's disgraceful.
[01:22:29.000 --> 01:22:35.000]  It's Benedict Arnold crap.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:45.000]  And I told people at the time, I said, listen, you're just getting rid of your own damn free speech if you don't stand up for me.
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:56.000]  And the lies they would tell, you know, my daughter, one of my daughters said, and I'm going to your calls, said to me this weekend,
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:23:03.000]  dad, I was told that you beat up a 10 year old. That's why you were taken off of YouTube.
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:07.000]  Now, that's the reason they give child endangerment. I played an ABC News clip.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:18.000]  It was all over the news. Everybody else could play it of a big 10 year old hitting an adult like six, seven times.
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:22.000]  And the adult pushes him down and the kid cries and all the stuff.
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:29.000]  And the news, some of them said that I did that. They said that was me.
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:43.000]  And I got Forbes and a few others do retractions. But to this day, people believe that that's that's the power of fake news.
[01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:50.000]  And, you know, I'm not going to say who told my daughter that, but I'm sure anyone can have a wild guess.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:58.000]  But the left doesn't care what's true or not. They know this stuff isn't true.
[01:23:58.000 --> 01:24:04.000]  But they don't care. And then the last time I got banned on YouTube, like six, seven years ago,
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:08.000]  we showed the WikiLeaks video of the minivan getting shot up.
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:14.000]  And we were like late to that story a couple days. It was on every new channel in the world.
[01:24:14.000 --> 01:24:19.000]  And then we showed it and we got taken down and then we appealed and stuff and they put us back up.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.000]  But that's what I deal with. And I'm not complaining.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:32.000]  I'm just saying once they're able to misrepresent who we are and get us off the air, then they can take everybody off the air.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:39.000]  Oh, and Joe's argument is, well, Alex, I'll have you back on, you know, once all your litigation's over.
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:45.000]  Well, by that string of thought, anybody ever being litigated against could not ever be interviewed anywhere.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:50.000]  CNN's probably got 200 lawsuits against them. Fox News has probably 200 at any one time.
[01:24:50.000 --> 01:24:53.000]  It's part of a big media company that just comes from the territory.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:57.000]  What city doesn't have 100 lawsuits against it at any one time or county?
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:25:01.000]  Hell, big cities have thousands of lawsuits, tens of thousands.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:04.000]  Oh, the city's closed. We have lawsuits.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:08.000]  The federal government probably has a million ongoing lawsuits against it.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:10.000]  Seriously, about a million. You look it up.
[01:25:10.000 --> 01:25:14.000]  Well, just shut the federal government down.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:17.000]  But see, it's that guilty until proven innocent.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:22.000]  Oh, we can't let you defend yourself anywhere on the Internet and we can't have you on
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:28.000]  because we'll get taken off.
[01:25:28.000 --> 01:25:32.000]  That's really what it is, is that the orders have come down.
[01:25:32.000 --> 01:25:34.000]  You don't let Jones on to defend himself.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:38.000]  He has to be silenced so we can then lie about him.
[01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:43.000]  And then men don't take that as a threat to their own rights.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  Women don't take that as a threat to their own rights and they don't circle the wagons.
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:52.000]  And so they pick us off every day.
[01:25:52.000 --> 01:25:56.000]  Another personality taking down, another person bullied, another person removed,
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  another person shut up until it's everybody.
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  And then Howard Stern, I finally went and listened to the tape
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000]  because so many people told me about it, repeatedly attacked me
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:10.000]  and said that I needed to be taken off the air and it was a good thing.
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  I mean, the only claim he had was that he was free speech.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:16.000]  This guy has Nambla on it, makes jokes about child molestation.
[01:26:16.000 --> 01:26:22.000]  This guy has Nazis on for hours saying the most horrible crap you could ever imagine
[01:26:22.000 --> 01:26:24.000]  and turning it into entertainment.
[01:26:24.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  He has a right to do that.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:32.000]  But oh, they run a giant PR campaign that I'm doing things I haven't done
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:34.000]  and then you just get the PR slip.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  Corporate wants you to say this on air and you get the slip.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  Or you get invited to a university to talk to a group of faculty
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  and really they're spooks.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:52.000]  And so you go down to the university and you sit and you talk to the people
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:56.000]  and they explain, oh, Joe, you've got a very important position.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  It's kind of the modern Jimmy Carson of our world.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:02.000]  And you're going to need to help society move forward
[01:27:02.000 --> 01:27:06.000]  and we've got a larger plan and this whole nationalist movement's out of control
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  and it's a crisis and we need to really help you and have you help us contain what's happening
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000]  because if we don't, Joe, there's going to be a civil war.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  But really they're the ones, yeah, Joe, I know the speech you got.
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:24.000]  I don't just know about the speech, I know the speech.
[01:27:24.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  So this is how they operate.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  And then people go, oh my God, I just got visited by the CIA.
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:36.000]  I better go along with them because that's scary.
[01:27:36.000 --> 01:27:38.000]  No, that's not the CIA.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  That's a bunch of criminal, academic scum that have infested our damn government
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.000]  and that worked with radical Islam and every other evil thing on the planet.
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:50.000]  And nobody's children are safe while these people are in charge.
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:52.000]  Nobody.
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:54.000]  Now, bear with me, callers, I apologize.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:58.000]  But if the hair lifts the admiral and water doesn't rise over Bear Creek,
[01:27:58.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  I'm going to go to John and Eric and Jacob and Justin and Bob and Caleb and D Ray and Craig and all of you
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  and we'll take the calls with Dan Lyman.
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:10.000]  I shouldn't have as many guests and have calls because I want the guests and I want the calls,
[01:28:10.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  but we're going to do it.
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.000]  And then they trigger me putting up Joe's face on the screen
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:18.000]  because I don't care about being lied about by all the other big shows
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  because I don't know Lester Holt.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  I know Hillary Clinton's a liar.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:28.000]  I know the walking poster boy for who I would cast as a pedophile in a movie,
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:32.000]  I'm not saying as a pedophile, Ryan Skelter is a liar.
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  But when you know the inside baseball of people going along with the system out of fear,
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  it really makes you lose faith.
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  But you know what? Our audience is awesome and you stood with us
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  and we're stronger than ever in many ways.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  So you do give me faith going into 2019.
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:52.000]  I salute and thank all the listeners, everybody else.
[01:28:52.000 --> 01:28:54.000]  By the way, everybody holding already get their number.
[01:28:54.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  We're going to give them a free gift and we're going to go to their calls.
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:29:00.000]  Silver has always been nature's very own antibiotic
[01:29:00.000 --> 01:29:04.000]  and only one system allows you to produce an endless apply of nano size silver solutions
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:06.000]  right from the convenience of your home.
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  Silver Lungs.
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000]  With the addition of our unique lung delivery system,
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000]  respiratory infections are targeted directly
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:14.000]  where traditional oral administration simply cannot reach.
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  This pioneering method also preserves the original particle sizes
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000]  and delivers your silver solution directly into the bloodstream.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:24.000]  See the Silver Lungs Generator and Long Delivery System at SilverLungs.com.
[01:29:24.000 --> 01:29:53.000]  That's SilverLungs.com.
[01:29:55.000 --> 01:30:01.000]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear,
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:03.000]  we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[01:30:03.000 --> 01:30:05.000]  That's the globalist only hope.
[01:30:05.000 --> 01:30:08.000]  So when you support InfoWars, when you spread our articles and videos,
[01:30:08.000 --> 01:30:10.000]  when you buy products at InfoWarsTour.com,
[01:30:10.000 --> 01:30:13.000]  you are literally not just supporting InfoWars in free speech
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:17.000]  and standing in defiance against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people,
[01:30:17.000 --> 01:30:19.000]  but you are standing for your own future
[01:30:19.000 --> 01:30:23.000]  and your own best shot of having an early warning system in America
[01:30:23.000 --> 01:30:25.000]  to stand against these individuals.
[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000]  When you order products at InfoWarsTour.com,
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000]  you fund not just an American Revolution,
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.000]  but a global revolution against tyranny.
[01:30:31.000 --> 01:30:34.000]  And we have the biggest specials ever running throughout to the end of the year
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:36.000]  as part of a total store clearance.
[01:30:36.000 --> 01:30:39.000]  Every order gets a free t-shirt.
[01:30:39.000 --> 01:30:40.000]  Every order gets free shipping.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:43.000]  Every order gets 50 to 75% off in total clearance,
[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:47.000]  and that funding allows us to go into the new year on sure footing
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:50.000]  to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year
[01:30:50.000 --> 01:30:52.000]  to not just fight, but to expand.
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:54.000]  We're on the march. The Empire is on the run.
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.000]  I salute you all.
[01:30:55.000 --> 01:31:24.000]  Now please take action at InfoWarsTour.com.
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000]  Because of their intensifying censorship,
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000]  it's more important than ever
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:32.000]  that everyone go to InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter
[01:31:32.000 --> 01:31:36.000]  and sign up via email so there's no way the censors can get between us
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:40.000]  with critical videos, articles, breaking news, intel, you name it.
[01:31:40.000 --> 01:31:44.000]  And so now I ask you more than ever to share the InfoWars.com articles,
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:48.000]  to share the videos, to tell people about the local stations you're listening to.
[01:31:48.000 --> 01:31:55.000]  The bare minimum you can do is sign up for the free newsletter at InfoWars.com forward slash newsletter.
[01:31:55.000 --> 01:31:58.000]  We are the Renaissance, and we are winning.
[01:31:58.000 --> 01:32:03.000]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[01:32:03.000 --> 01:32:07.000]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media
[01:32:07.000 --> 01:32:10.000]  that can call the fact that the Emperor has no clothes,
[01:32:10.000 --> 01:32:13.000]  they can call BS if game over.
[01:32:13.000 --> 01:32:17.000]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000]  and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:23.000]  that can be targeted.
[01:32:23.000 --> 01:32:29.000]  There's only two groups in the U.S., InfoWars and Matt Drudge of DrudgeReport.com
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000]  that are truly independent.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:34.000]  And of course there are two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[01:32:34.000 --> 01:32:35.000]  It really is amazing.
[01:32:35.000 --> 01:32:38.000]  That's why as we close out 2018,
[01:32:38.000 --> 01:32:41.000]  I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in
[01:32:41.000 --> 01:32:42.000]  and how far we've come together.
[01:32:42.000 --> 01:32:44.000]  Just remind you that you are the power,
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:47.000]  the link through the will of InfoWars.
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:52.000]  So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswars.com, christenpudda.com
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000]  because if you don't spread the articles in the videos, no one else will.
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:57.000]  We're all in each other's hands.
[01:32:57.000 --> 01:33:26.000]  Bless you all and thank you.
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:30.000]  Most systems that have been set up by the mega corporations
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.000]  are designed to get followers into their process
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:39.000]  and then advance followers because they're conformist.
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  But conformity isn't popular in the human species,
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:46.000]  especially in who people want to follow.
[01:33:46.000 --> 01:33:51.000]  So you want followers who pose as leaders who are really conformists.
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:56.000]  But when you come down to a revolutionary period like we're in globally,
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:34:00.000]  you really begin to see just how conformist most people are.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:04.000]  But it makes me admire Michael Savage that he wouldn't sell out
[01:34:04.000 --> 01:34:09.000]  and wouldn't try to take down Trump so they're canceling a show
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:12.000]  and replacing him with Ben Shapiro.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:16.000]  It makes me admire Matt Drudge that he hasn't backed down in support of Trump.
[01:34:16.000 --> 01:34:18.000]  It makes me admire all of you.
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.000]  It doesn't mean Trump's perfect, but boy, he's been fighting hard
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.000]  and they sure hate his guts because he's taken power away from the globalists
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  and putting it back in America.
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:31.000]  And the good news is, it's happening all over the world.
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  And Dan Lyman, who heads up europewars.com, our European division,
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  who does an amazing job, has been there for many of the yellow vest demonstrations.
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  He's been covering it all.
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  He lives in Switzerland.
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:46.000]  It was just a hop, skip, and a jump from Paris, France.
[01:34:46.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  And he has been there covering it in detail.
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:50.000]  Chronicle for us.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  So much has happened.
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:52.000]  Then we'll go to calls.
[01:34:52.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  What's been happening, Dan, because of me so much pulling down EU flags,
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:35:00.000]  armored EU vehicles showing up, top French general saying,
[01:35:00.000 --> 01:35:02.000]  Macron's a traitor.
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.000]  Then storming government buildings.
[01:35:04.000 --> 01:35:06.000]  I mean, wow.
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  The media seven weeks ago tried to brand this.
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:12.000]  It's just a gasoline price, you know, protest.
[01:35:12.000 --> 01:35:16.000]  But no, as you've been saying for seven weeks, as you've interviewed the people,
[01:35:16.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  they are nationalists.
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  They are patriots.
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:22.000]  So Dan, break this down for us.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000]  And thanks for joining us.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000]  Great to be back with the Alex and Mary Christmas.
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  Yeah, it's just, it's amazing that they continue.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000]  I think that everyone thought that this would just be a kind of a thing
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  that would fizzle out.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  I know the media has been doing working very hard to present this as a
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:38.000]  movement that is waning.
[01:35:38.000 --> 01:35:42.000]  But if you look kind of through the mainstream media deception,
[01:35:42.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  it does seem to be continuing.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:46.000]  I'm sure there are some people who can't get out every weekend.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.000]  So maybe it's more the diehards that are still out there keeping the flame lit.
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  But they do seem to be continuing on.
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:56.000]  They're just had their seventh week of protests.
[01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:58.000]  And they're trying some new tactics now.
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:00.000]  Of course, that was a great video you just showed there,
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:02.000]  them taking down the EU flag.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  And also they've actually been targeting Macron's holiday home,
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:08.000]  break on stone. They've been trying to like,
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:10.000]  I don't know if to do anything really violent,
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  but making their presence known and it's been covered as them basically
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:16.000]  trying to storm the holiday home.
[01:36:16.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  So they're really going after Macron at all angles.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  And you can tell that they're quite wary of these people because a couple
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:28.000]  of weeks ago it was rumored that Macron had a helicopter on standby in Paris
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000]  in case things got too hot.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:31.000]  He was ready to get out of there.
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:34.000]  So I think they are prepared for anything to go down at this point.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000]  And let's be clear.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:40.000]  He stays a lot of the time at an armored fortress off the coast
[01:36:40.000 --> 01:36:42.000]  with 50-foot walls.
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:44.000]  We put that back on screen for TV viewers.
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:46.000]  He says Europe shouldn't have walls.
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  Citizens shouldn't have walls.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  They're forcing French, German, Swedish, Italian citizens
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  to take up to a dozen per family, illegal aliens into their houses.
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  But oh, look, he's got big old 30, 40, 50-foot walls
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  all around an armored fortress on an island,
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  just like all the rest of these elates do.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:10.000]  Yeah, absolutely.
[01:37:10.000 --> 01:37:12.000]  Just like Obama, just like the Vatican.
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:16.000]  So safety for me, but not for thee.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  And you can tell these people, I mean, they're still going.
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:20.000]  It's incredible.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:22.000]  And this movement is spreading across the world.
[01:37:22.000 --> 01:37:26.000]  I've seen videos in Lebanon, in Iraq, of course, in Belgium,
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  and surrounding countries in UK, even a little bit in Canada,
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:34.000]  has become a very symbolic movement of people who are tired
[01:37:34.000 --> 01:37:36.000]  of the way the elites are reigning over them.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  And now we've seen Syrian women and others say,
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  please send our men back.
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  They've almost sent everybody out of these countries.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:46.000]  This is a literal globalist colonization operation.
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  Not only are they not sending them back, they're bringing in more.
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:52.000]  I just did a story last week that Sweden announced
[01:37:52.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  they were going to be setting a new quota for the coming year
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:58.000]  where they would be flying in 5,000 more migrants
[01:37:58.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  from the Middle East and Africa.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000]  So they're actively seeking migrants.
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  By the way, she did this going back over six years.
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  They always give 1,000, a 10,000, a 5,000 number as the cover.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  So people go, oh, that's just those flights, and then it's a million.
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:12.000]  Right.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  And can you imagine, I mean, the amount of manpower and resources
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  it takes to fly people from the Middle East and from Africa
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  and then from some of these camps in Greece and whatnot
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:24.000]  and actually bring them in on airplanes to these airports
[01:38:24.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  and the security risks as well.
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  I mean, the things that we all go through,
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  I happen to be in the States right now just visiting family
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:34.000]  for the holidays and just the flying experience in the States.
[01:38:34.000 --> 01:38:36.000]  It just gets worse and worse every time.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  We're all treated like criminals, and yet they'll bring in, you know,
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  5,000 Somalis and Afghans into these airports
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000]  and let them just, you know, kind of pass through
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:48.000]  without very little identification
[01:38:48.000 --> 01:38:50.000]  or any knowledge of who these people really are.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:54.000]  I was in Catalonia a few years ago in Spain
[01:38:54.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  and then I was also in Italy for a week
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:02.000]  and all the Italians did was complain
[01:39:02.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  and every tree in Rome, there's hardly any,
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  little bitty park areas, would have a couple hundred people under it
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.000]  and people crapping everywhere
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:16.000]  and the Italians complaining, yes, last week,
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  ISIS stabbed three police here
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:22.000]  and now they keep them away from the monuments
[01:39:22.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  but they're down every, and you go down side streets
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:28.000]  and it's literally Italians everywhere
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:30.000]  cussing and yelling and screaming at them.
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:32.000]  I mean, people are pissed and it's just,
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.000]  and now I'm told, that was three years ago,
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  Dan, I'm told it's just incredibly insane now.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.000]  It is, as you might recall,
[01:39:40.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  I was down in Turin covering Bilderberg earlier this year
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:48.000]  and I knew to expect to see some pretty shocking scenes,
[01:39:48.000 --> 01:39:50.000]  you know, in the parks there and whatnot,
[01:39:50.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  but it still exceeded my expectations.
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:56.000]  They're allowed to just congregate wherever they like.
[01:39:56.000 --> 01:40:00.000]  I've done a couple of stories recently about a park
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.000]  and a train station, a very busy one.
[01:40:02.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  Some say it's the busiest in Brussels
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:08.000]  where basically the migrants that live in the park
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  during the warmer weather, hundreds of them, if not thousands,
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  and you can watch the videos of them online,
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  the weather gets bad so now they've basically
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:18.000]  commandeered this entire metro station where they're all living
[01:40:18.000 --> 01:40:20.000]  in there and they just made it their home,
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  a de facto migrant camp, they play soccer down there,
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  they use it as their garbage disposal
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:28.000]  and they just basically have taken the whole thing over
[01:40:28.000 --> 01:40:30.000]  and to put that into perspective,
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:34.000]  that would be like in Penn Station, let's say,
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:36.000]  in terms of the importance of the train station,
[01:40:36.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  if that was just being basically overrun by migrants.
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:42.000]  So you can imagine the situation there
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  and it's the same story playing out across much of Western European cities.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  Now we have Merkel last week.
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  Tell folks what she said in a speech last week
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:56.000]  and again this weekend about nationalism.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  Yeah, I mean, she's coming out hard against nationalism
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  even on her way out the door.
[01:41:01.000 --> 01:41:04.000]  I did catch a little bit of that speech earlier
[01:41:04.000 --> 01:41:10.000]  that she was just constantly advancing the globalist agenda
[01:41:10.000 --> 01:41:14.000]  with her power wanes and someone's swooping in to succeed her soon
[01:41:14.000 --> 01:41:18.000]  and she's just relegated the chairmanship of her party.
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  I mean, this lady is going to fight down to the bitter end.
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  Do you have to wonder where she's going to go from here?
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:26.000]  Is she going to just basically slide into EU government
[01:41:26.000 --> 01:41:30.000]  perhaps at the non-elected level that remains to be seen
[01:41:30.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  but Germany is in a critical situation as well
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  and she's basically been the architect of that
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:38.000]  or the facilitator and it's sad to see these scenes,
[01:41:38.000 --> 01:41:40.000]  these kinds of scenes that you're showing on screen
[01:41:40.000 --> 01:41:42.000]  are not uncommon around Europe.
[01:41:42.000 --> 01:41:44.000]  And now they're running the same play against the US
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:46.000]  and a bigger migrant hordes coming
[01:41:46.000 --> 01:41:48.000]  and then there'll be more children that die
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.000]  and then when they die, it's our fault that their parents brought them
[01:41:50.000 --> 01:41:52.000]  over two, three, four thousand miles
[01:41:52.000 --> 01:41:54.000]  and smuggled them and did all this.
[01:41:54.000 --> 01:41:56.000]  It's our fault.
[01:41:56.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  Right, and there's another migrant situation developing
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:02.000]  a new one here that is starting to get coverage.
[01:42:02.000 --> 01:42:04.000]  It's getting a lot of UK press coverage
[01:42:04.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  but basically migrants are now setting sail across the channel
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:10.000]  from France and they've had a serious spike
[01:42:10.000 --> 01:42:12.000]  in the last six to eight weeks.
[01:42:12.000 --> 01:42:14.000]  They intercepted five boats alone
[01:42:14.000 --> 01:42:16.000]  on Christmas Day with 40 migrants
[01:42:16.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  trying to make their way from France to the UK
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:22.000]  and so we have just like, when one fire gets put out
[01:42:22.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  another one, you know, flames up hotter than ever
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:28.000]  so that's another situation that everyone should be keeping an eye on
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  because the migrants are finding a way one way or another
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:34.000]  with the aid of the NGOs and the human traffickers.
[01:42:34.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  And these stories are so big, we have whole websites
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  just dedicated to what's happening
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  to the takeover of Europe and the fight for Europe.

[01:45:16.000 --> 01:45:18.000]  listening to Infowars around the world.
[01:45:18.000 --> 01:45:22.000]  The eyes and ears of liberty that were immune
[01:45:22.000 --> 01:45:26.000]  or at least resistant to the globalist programming.
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:30.000]  Everybody knows who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians
[01:45:30.000 --> 01:45:35.000]  who tend to be immune to the globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it
[01:45:35.000 --> 01:45:38.000]  and that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:41.000]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying.
[01:45:41.000 --> 01:45:43.000]  2018 has been insane.
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:46.000]  2019 is going to be the big decision maker
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:49.000]  and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me.
[01:45:49.000 --> 01:45:52.000]  Not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart of everything
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:54.000]  resisting these globalists.
[01:45:54.000 --> 01:45:57.000]  So whatever you do, take action and realize we're changing history together
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:46:17.000]  and we're going to salute you.

[01:46:54.000 --> 01:47:01.000]  High quality swirple foods powered by my Patreon supply.
[01:47:01.000 --> 01:47:30.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[01:47:31.000 --> 01:47:57.000]  Ladies and gentlemen, there's an article up on Infowars.com
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:47:59.000]  that's absolutely critical.
[01:47:59.000 --> 01:48:01.000]  I hope you get it out to everyone you know.
[01:48:01.000 --> 01:48:03.000]  It's by Mindy Robinson.
[01:48:03.000 --> 01:48:07.000]  Twitter censors conservatives but won't ban pedophiles.
[01:48:07.000 --> 01:48:12.000]  And I read the article earlier today and it is just astounding
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:16.000]  how far this is going and how there are giant Twitter accounts
[01:48:16.000 --> 01:48:18.000]  dedicated to recruiting children for sex
[01:48:18.000 --> 01:48:21.000]  and getting sex with children legalized.
[01:48:21.000 --> 01:48:24.000]  And then through school, child education programs,
[01:48:24.000 --> 01:48:27.000]  they're openly pushing it on children as well.
[01:48:27.000 --> 01:48:29.000]  They're making their move.
[01:48:29.000 --> 01:48:32.000]  Instead of a Tet offensive, it's a pedophile offensive
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:36.000]  where they just hit you on every front
[01:48:36.000 --> 01:48:39.000]  until you just get overwhelmed and accept it.
[01:48:39.000 --> 01:48:42.000]  So the article is very important to all parents you know,
[01:48:42.000 --> 01:48:45.000]  all educators you know, we've got to stand against this.
[01:48:45.000 --> 01:48:47.000]  All right, I want to take some calls from all over the map here.
[01:48:47.000 --> 01:48:50.000]  Dan, you're a smart guy, you can respond to them.
[01:48:50.000 --> 01:48:53.000]  But I wanted to ask you, why do you think Merkel,
[01:48:53.000 --> 01:48:56.000]  why do you think Macron, why do you think the EU,
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.000]  the globalist are just coming out and saying
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:49:01.000]  no borders, no walls, no Europe, no USA at all
[01:49:01.000 --> 01:49:04.000]  and openly saying we're going to ignore voters.
[01:49:04.000 --> 01:49:07.000]  We're going to have an EU army that forces you to do it.
[01:49:07.000 --> 01:49:11.000]  We're just going to, I mean, it's so clear they're conquering everyone
[01:49:11.000 --> 01:49:14.000]  and saying they're going to have the UN run the world
[01:49:14.000 --> 01:49:16.000]  for the migrant crisis they created.
[01:49:16.000 --> 01:49:17.000]  It's so simple.
[01:49:17.000 --> 01:49:20.000]  This is the vehicle of global domination
[01:49:20.000 --> 01:49:22.000]  and how they get the average leftist
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.000]  when this is designed to bankrupt our countries
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:27.000]  and our pension funds, how they get the average leftist
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:28.000]  to go along with it.
[01:49:28.000 --> 01:49:31.000]  A, why do you think they are being so bold?
[01:49:31.000 --> 01:49:34.000]  And then B, I look at the elections,
[01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:36.000]  the socialists are now joining nationalists
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:38.000]  because they don't want to go bankrupt.
[01:49:38.000 --> 01:49:40.000]  It isn't working, Dan.
[01:49:40.000 --> 01:49:42.000]  Right, you do have some, even some left wing groups
[01:49:42.000 --> 01:49:44.000]  that are starting to come out against mass immigration
[01:49:44.000 --> 01:49:47.000]  for different reasons, but hey, we'll take it.
[01:49:47.000 --> 01:49:49.000]  I mean, anyone who wants to come out against this situation,
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.000]  I think it is the front and center issue of our time
[01:49:52.000 --> 01:49:55.000]  and poll after poll reflects that across Europe
[01:49:55.000 --> 01:49:58.000]  and of course across the West in general.
[01:49:58.000 --> 01:50:01.000]  To your other question, these people are evil.
[01:50:01.000 --> 01:50:03.000]  They are pure evil and they are compromised.
[01:50:03.000 --> 01:50:06.000]  Many of them, people like Macron are compromised.
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:08.000]  As we know, many of them are childless.
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.000]  They don't, they're living in the now.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.000]  They don't care about the future
[01:50:11.000 --> 01:50:13.000]  because they will always live the good life,
[01:50:13.000 --> 01:50:17.000]  assuming they escape these revolutions unscathed.
[01:50:17.000 --> 01:50:19.000]  They'll always be under protection.
[01:50:19.000 --> 01:50:20.000]  They'll live in their mansions.
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:21.000]  They'll live in their palaces.
[01:50:21.000 --> 01:50:24.000]  So, I think they're living for the here and the now
[01:50:24.000 --> 01:50:27.000]  and there are probably much darker things going on
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:30.000]  behind the scenes that relate perhaps to your previous story
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:33.000]  with the Minnie Robinson and pedophilia
[01:50:33.000 --> 01:50:35.000]  and just the way that these people are compromised
[01:50:35.000 --> 01:50:38.000]  and the people that they answer to as well.
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:41.000]  And recently I did a story of Franz Timmermans
[01:50:41.000 --> 01:50:44.000]  who is now running to replace Junker as the head of the EU.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:48.000]  He's currently the vice president of the European Commission.
[01:50:48.000 --> 01:50:52.000]  He gave a speech and said that Africa and Europe's destinies
[01:50:52.000 --> 01:50:55.000]  are linked and we are in this together.
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:58.000]  And he called for massive resources to be set aside
[01:50:58.000 --> 01:51:01.000]  to welcome many more people from the third world.
[01:51:01.000 --> 01:51:03.000]  And I quote him here saying,
[01:51:03.000 --> 01:51:05.000]  whose fate is going to be dealt with by whom?
[01:51:05.000 --> 01:51:08.000]  Europe's fate by Africans, Africa's fate by Europeans.
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:11.000]  We're in this together, our destinies are linked.
[01:51:11.000 --> 01:51:15.000]  So, that's the same mantra that Macron has paroled
[01:51:15.000 --> 01:51:19.000]  and Junker and Merkel, they believe that they're going to merge
[01:51:19.000 --> 01:51:23.000]  basically these two continents and civilizations together
[01:51:23.000 --> 01:51:27.000]  and probably create a more manageable populace
[01:51:27.000 --> 01:51:29.000]  but it will just be in this constant state of turmoil
[01:51:29.000 --> 01:51:32.000]  which does not bode well for Europeans at all.
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:35.000]  Which they admit is the management of bringing in groups
[01:51:35.000 --> 01:51:37.000]  that won't integrate, who don't get in the melting pot,
[01:51:37.000 --> 01:51:41.000]  who on average five years later, 90 plus percent don't have a job
[01:51:41.000 --> 01:51:43.000]  because they don't even let them get jobs.
[01:51:43.000 --> 01:51:45.000]  You bring them into these social welfare states,
[01:51:45.000 --> 01:51:48.000]  they don't contribute to have a totally divided population,
[01:51:48.000 --> 01:51:50.000]  divide and conquer.
[01:51:50.000 --> 01:51:52.000]  It's just astounding.
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:56.000]  This is 21st century warfare directed by the globalist.
[01:51:56.000 --> 01:51:59.000]  It is simply astounding.
[01:51:59.000 --> 01:52:01.000]  It should be so clear cut for everyone to stand against this,
[01:52:01.000 --> 01:52:04.000]  Dan Lyman of EuropeWars.com.
[01:52:04.000 --> 01:52:06.000]  Absolutely.
[01:52:06.000 --> 01:52:08.000]  You had mentioned that in Italy,
[01:52:08.000 --> 01:52:10.000]  you catch these stories,
[01:52:10.000 --> 01:52:13.000]  how to stab a policeman.
[01:52:13.000 --> 01:52:15.000]  That is something that I've noticed more and more
[01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:18.000]  with the coverage that we've been doing for EuropeWars
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:21.000]  is that there are so many things that happen on a daily basis
[01:52:21.000 --> 01:52:24.000]  that get glossed over, they get passing coverage
[01:52:24.000 --> 01:52:27.000]  and the mainstream media obfuscates really key details.
[01:52:27.000 --> 01:52:30.000]  I'm noticing that a quickening essentially,
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.000]  more and more every day.
[01:52:32.000 --> 01:52:37.000]  Just today alone, they hide the really key details.
[01:52:37.000 --> 01:52:41.000]  You'll hear a German man raped a woman. No, it's not a German man.
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:47.000]  Exactly. Today, they just uncovered 2,000 pounds of fireworks
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:49.000]  in a Hamburg home.
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:51.000]  All they say was a 23-year-old man.
[01:52:51.000 --> 01:52:53.000]  At Hanover Airport in Germany,
[01:52:53.000 --> 01:52:55.000]  somebody managed to penetrate through security
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:58.000]  and drive a vehicle onto the tarmac.
[01:52:58.000 --> 01:53:01.000]  You have cars being set on fire all the time
[01:53:01.000 --> 01:53:03.000]  across Sweden and across France.
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:06.000]  By the way, thousands a day sometimes, usually hundreds a day.
[01:53:06.000 --> 01:53:09.000]  I mean, we're talking hundreds per city, per night,
[01:53:09.000 --> 01:53:12.000]  sometimes in countries, over a thousand a night.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:16.000]  We've shown the video. It's like something out of an apocalypse.
[01:53:16.000 --> 01:53:19.000]  It is, and we see that of course during the mass protest,
[01:53:19.000 --> 01:53:21.000]  but it could just be any old given night
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:24.000]  and they'll blame it on back-to-school unrest or poverty.
[01:53:24.000 --> 01:53:27.000]  It's like a lot of people are seeing,
[01:53:27.000 --> 01:53:30.000]  one of their most important possessions just turned into ashes
[01:53:30.000 --> 01:53:32.000]  and I don't know how people put up with it.
[01:53:32.000 --> 01:53:36.000]  And why are the Islamists from Africa and the Middle East doing this?
[01:53:36.000 --> 01:53:38.000]  Because they admit they're doing it.
[01:53:38.000 --> 01:53:40.000]  They even admit now in Germany.
[01:53:40.000 --> 01:53:42.000]  Well, there's a new group preying on migrants, Muslims.
[01:53:42.000 --> 01:53:44.000]  Well, yeah, they're recruiting them into their gangs
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:48.000]  and then now you finally see generals and national police saying,
[01:53:48.000 --> 01:53:50.000]  our civilization basically has collapsed.
[01:53:50.000 --> 01:53:52.000]  We need to stop this.
[01:53:52.000 --> 01:53:54.000]  So there does seem to be a moment in Europe
[01:53:54.000 --> 01:53:56.000]  where they're saying we need to either
[01:53:56.000 --> 01:53:59.000]  evacuate or do something.
[01:53:59.000 --> 01:54:03.000]  Absolutely. And there are grumblings under the surface.
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:05.000]  If you recall a few weeks ago,
[01:54:05.000 --> 01:54:09.000]  there was a group of about 200 special forces and veterans
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:12.000]  from the military in Germany who they arrested
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:15.000]  that they were planning a plot to basically overthrow Merkel.
[01:54:15.000 --> 01:54:17.000]  Of course, they branded these guys as neo-Nazis.
[01:54:17.000 --> 01:54:19.000]  Maybe they were. I couldn't speak to that.
[01:54:19.000 --> 01:54:22.000]  But you have people start coalition starting to form
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:25.000]  under the surface. You saw the French police in many cases.
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:28.000]  The French serving top general said the same thing.
[01:54:28.000 --> 01:54:30.000]  And of course, they're not white supremacists come out.
[01:54:30.000 --> 01:54:33.000]  They're saying there's a plot to end the country.
[01:54:33.000 --> 01:54:35.000]  We have to take action.
[01:54:35.000 --> 01:54:37.000]  Right. There's only so much that they can take.
[01:54:37.000 --> 01:54:40.000]  Just last week, you had a top Swedish police officer
[01:54:40.000 --> 01:54:43.000]  who was in charge of gang-related warfare, basically,
[01:54:43.000 --> 01:54:45.000]  investigating that in Stockholm.
[01:54:45.000 --> 01:54:47.000]  He's a security expert.
[01:54:47.000 --> 01:54:50.000]  And he said that because Sweden just reached their highest
[01:54:50.000 --> 01:54:53.000]  number of shooting deaths ever in the country's history,
[01:54:53.000 --> 01:54:57.000]  he thinks that the country is entering a state of war.
[01:54:57.000 --> 01:55:00.000]  That's what he compared it to. Those were hurt. His words, not ours.
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:02.000]  It is a state of war.
[01:55:02.000 --> 01:55:04.000]  These people have been brought here to conquer their imams.
[01:55:04.000 --> 01:55:07.000]  Say it. Christmas is worse than murder.
[01:55:07.000 --> 01:55:10.000]  Take their weapon. They are weak. We will kill them all.
[01:55:10.000 --> 01:55:15.000]  Those are quotes of top imams broadcast on British and German television.
[01:55:15.000 --> 01:55:19.000]  And they have national state-run TV telling young preteen girls
[01:55:19.000 --> 01:55:23.000]  to get a Muslim husband by 14 that they are the best.
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:27.000]  So that's the left cucking your daughters, folks.
[01:55:27.000 --> 01:55:30.000]  And it's that pedophile radical Islamic connection.
[01:55:30.000 --> 01:55:34.000]  That's why they're for it because pedophilia is legal under Islam.
[01:55:34.000 --> 01:55:37.000]  Let's go ahead and go ahead and take a call from John in Wisconsin.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.000]  John, thanks for holding your trooper.
[01:55:39.000 --> 01:55:41.000]  Happy New Year coming up.
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:43.000]  What do you think about world government?
[01:55:43.000 --> 01:55:46.000]  Well, there's two points I'd like to make.
[01:55:46.000 --> 01:55:50.000]  First of all, I think that my idea of walking down
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:56.000]  Congress and the Senate in full session
[01:55:56.000 --> 01:56:00.000]  and have the Surgeon in Arms call the U.S. Marshals out
[01:56:00.000 --> 01:56:09.000]  to go down on a list, free, prepared of people openly operating under sedition.
[01:56:09.000 --> 01:56:11.000]  I guess this country.
[01:56:11.000 --> 01:56:13.000]  Well, I mean, sir, we have reached that point.
[01:56:13.000 --> 01:56:16.000]  That's what Germany, France, all the military leaders are saying.
[01:56:16.000 --> 01:56:19.000]  That's what this is. We are seeing our countries destroyed right now.
[01:56:19.000 --> 01:56:23.000]  Well, you know, somebody on your show a couple of years ago
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:27.000]  when Trump first started running for president and had an idea
[01:56:27.000 --> 01:56:33.000]  where Trump should just go in there and take out all the bad news
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:38.000]  out of Congress and have a special general election,
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:43.000]  repopulate the seats and then put everybody on notice
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:47.000]  that if they don't work together, there could be a rest of the first sedition.
[01:56:47.000 --> 01:56:49.000]  Well, here's the problem.
[01:56:49.000 --> 01:56:52.000]  I would say that's authoritarianism if you're the one that does it first.
[01:56:52.000 --> 01:56:55.000]  But the globalists are lawlessly plunging our economy,
[01:56:55.000 --> 01:56:57.000]  lawlessly opening our borders for child trafficking,
[01:56:57.000 --> 01:56:59.000]  lawlessly allowing daily cop killing,
[01:56:59.000 --> 01:57:01.000]  lawlessly trying to bankrupt.
[01:57:01.000 --> 01:57:04.000]  All the top generals are saying we're in a state of war.
[01:57:04.000 --> 01:57:05.000]  The countries are collapsing.
[01:57:05.000 --> 01:57:07.000]  Europe's only five years ahead of us.
[01:57:07.000 --> 01:57:11.000]  So the left has put us into the civil emergency.
[01:57:11.000 --> 01:57:15.000]  So Trump should declare a new emergency to kill Obama's emergency
[01:57:15.000 --> 01:57:17.000]  that he put us under two and a half years ago.
[01:57:17.000 --> 01:57:19.000]  See, that's the little secret.
[01:57:19.000 --> 01:57:21.000]  Is Obama put us under a civil emergency
[01:57:21.000 --> 01:57:23.000]  and Trump doesn't understand how to get rid of it
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:25.000]  because he's surrounded by a bunch of traitors,
[01:57:25.000 --> 01:57:27.000]  like the ones he just kicked out.
[01:57:27.000 --> 01:57:29.000]  Thank you, John. We'll get Dan Lyman to take on that
[01:57:29.000 --> 01:57:31.000]  and more calls straight ahead.
[01:57:31.000 --> 01:57:33.000]  Then, saw the story, Top Story on dredgerport.com
[01:57:33.000 --> 01:57:35.000]  over the weekend at infowars.com.
[01:57:35.000 --> 01:57:38.000]  The fellow that went into the vape shop
[01:57:38.000 --> 01:57:40.000]  and the libtard went crazy on him.
[01:57:40.000 --> 01:57:42.000]  He said, do my bidding.
[01:57:42.000 --> 01:57:44.000]  He's going to be joining us.
[01:57:44.000 --> 01:57:47.000]  He signed his last night, too. He's pretty funny.
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:49.000]  The globalists are trying to set up
[01:57:49.000 --> 01:57:51.000]  a private corporate world government
[01:57:51.000 --> 01:57:53.000]  that's above the law.
[01:57:53.000 --> 01:57:56.000]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media
[01:57:56.000 --> 01:57:59.000]  that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes,
[01:57:59.000 --> 01:58:02.000]  they can call BS if game over.
[01:58:02.000 --> 01:58:04.000]  But if you look at everybody else,
[01:58:04.000 --> 01:58:06.000]  like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh
[01:58:06.000 --> 01:58:08.000]  and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity,
[01:58:08.000 --> 01:58:10.000]  they are all beholden to the networks they're on
[01:58:10.000 --> 01:58:12.000]  that can be targeted.
[01:58:12.000 --> 01:58:14.000]  There are only two groups in the U.S.,
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:17.000]  Infowars and Matt Drudge of dredgerport.com
[01:58:17.000 --> 01:58:19.000]  that are truly independent.
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:22.000]  And, of course, they're two of the dominant media forces
[01:58:22.000 --> 01:58:24.000]  in the world. It really is amazing.
[01:58:24.000 --> 01:58:26.000]  That's why as we close out 2018,
[01:58:26.000 --> 01:58:28.000]  I want to just remind the listeners
[01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.000]  of the amazing fight we're all in
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:32.000]  and how far we've come together.
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:34.000]  Just remind you that you are the power,
[01:58:34.000 --> 01:58:36.000]  you're the strength, you're the will of Infowars.
[01:58:36.000 --> 01:58:38.000]  So please spread the links, infowars.com,
[01:58:38.000 --> 01:58:40.000]  newswars.com, christenpana.com,
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:42.000]  because if you don't spread the articles in the videos,
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:44.000]  no one else will.
[01:58:44.000 --> 01:58:46.000]  We're all in each other's hands.
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:48.000]  God bless you all and thank you.
[01:58:52.000 --> 01:58:54.000]  Years ago, Infowars Life created
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:56.000]  the powerful MycoZX formula
[01:58:56.000 --> 01:58:58.000]  to help you combat internal yeast.
[01:58:58.000 --> 01:59:00.000]  As the years went on and more toxins were pumped
[01:59:00.000 --> 01:59:02.000]  into the environment, our team knew
[01:59:02.000 --> 01:59:04.000]  we had to create a bigger and better formula
[01:59:04.000 --> 01:59:06.000]  to help support your gut health.
[01:59:06.000 --> 01:59:08.000]  MycoZX Plus is the result of the search
[01:59:08.000 --> 01:59:10.000]  for that formula, a unique natural formula
[01:59:10.000 --> 01:59:12.000]  designed to support the body's natural
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:14.000]  cleansing of yeast and fungal organisms.
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:16.000]  There's no better product to help your body
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:18.000]  fight back. MycoZX Plus
[01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:20.000]  helps support a healthy microbial balance
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:22.000]  in the body, supports your digestive tract
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:24.000]  and addresses the intestinal yeast
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:26.000]  that can cause you problems if it goes unchecked.
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:28.000]  Powered by an impressive list of ingredients
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:30.000]  including grapefruit seed extract,
[01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:32.000]  poudarco bark and grape seed extract,
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:34.000]  our formula is fueled by ingredients
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:36.000]  that stood the test of time
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:38.000]  as powerful microbalancing properties.
[01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:40.000]  Pick up a bottle of the new
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:42.000]  and improved MycoZX Plus today
[01:59:42.000 --> 01:59:44.000]  at InfowarsLife.com.
[01:59:44.000 --> 01:59:46.000]  That's InfowarsLife.com.
[01:59:46.000 --> 01:59:48.000]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Show.
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:18.000]  I'll tell you, Dan Lyman,
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:20.000]  we got to get him on more.
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.000]  He is a smart cookie.
[02:00:22.000 --> 02:00:24.000]  Of course, he works with Infowars.
[02:00:24.000 --> 02:00:26.000]  That's a great job.
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:28.000]  EuropeWars.com.
[02:00:28.000 --> 02:00:30.000]  Got any tips for him?
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:32.000]  Go there and email him,
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:34.000]  or you want to host him in your country.
[02:00:34.000 --> 02:00:36.000]  You want to get this man on the road more
[02:00:36.000 --> 02:00:38.000]  because he always knocks shit out of the park.
[02:00:38.000 --> 02:00:40.000]  Trying to form a team for him over there in Europe.
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:42.000]  I'll tell you, Dan Lyman, we got to get him on more.
[02:00:42.000 --> 02:00:44.000]  He is a smart cookie.
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:46.000]  Trying to form a team for him over there in Europe.
[02:00:46.000 --> 02:00:48.000]  Didn't even plug last hour.
[02:00:48.000 --> 02:00:50.000]  But that's how you fund the operation.
[02:00:50.000 --> 02:00:52.000]  Biggest sales in our history.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:54.000]  We're going to have to end it there tomorrow.
[02:00:54.000 --> 02:00:56.000]  They're year-end sales.
[02:00:56.000 --> 02:00:58.000]  They don't have to pay the franchise tax.
[02:00:58.000 --> 02:01:00.000]  Texas has an inventory tax.
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:02.000]  There's also a federal one as well.
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:04.000]  We're trying to sell everything.
[02:01:04.000 --> 02:01:06.000]  We've got a lot of great products.
[02:01:06.000 --> 02:01:08.000]  Biggest sales ever.
[02:01:08.000 --> 02:01:10.000]  InfowarsLife.com.
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.000]  Let's take a few more calls here.
[02:01:12.000 --> 02:01:14.000]  Hello, Alex.
[02:01:14.000 --> 02:01:16.000]  Just a comment.
[02:01:16.000 --> 02:01:18.000]  New Year's Eve wish and
[02:01:18.000 --> 02:01:20.000]  say something about one of your shirts.
[02:01:20.000 --> 02:01:22.000]  Okay, thank you.
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:24.000]  I'm very happy that
[02:01:24.000 --> 02:01:26.000]  you found your calling because
[02:01:26.000 --> 02:01:28.000]  America needs you.
[02:01:28.000 --> 02:01:30.000]  You're the right man at the right time.
[02:01:30.000 --> 02:01:32.000]  Thank you very much.
[02:01:32.000 --> 02:01:34.000]  Thank you, man.
[02:01:34.000 --> 02:01:36.000]  My New Year's Eve wishes
[02:01:36.000 --> 02:01:38.000]  that Democrats
[02:01:38.000 --> 02:01:40.000]  keep coming after President Trump
[02:01:40.000 --> 02:01:42.000]  and that he
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:44.000]  releases all those documents
[02:01:44.000 --> 02:01:46.000]  you said that are being
[02:01:46.000 --> 02:01:48.000]  printed in the Pentagon
[02:01:48.000 --> 02:01:50.000]  now. Yes.
[02:01:50.000 --> 02:01:52.000]  And that he puts these people in jail
[02:01:52.000 --> 02:01:54.000]  because otherwise it's just
[02:01:54.000 --> 02:01:56.000]  political gossip to Joe Blow on the street.
[02:01:56.000 --> 02:01:58.000]  Well, that's right.
[02:01:58.000 --> 02:02:00.000]  If the president doesn't know
[02:02:00.000 --> 02:02:02.000]  they've got the knives out for him
[02:02:02.000 --> 02:02:04.000]  and they're going to lie to him and say
[02:02:04.000 --> 02:02:06.000]  they're going to compromise, they're not going to.
[02:02:06.000 --> 02:02:08.000]  The last time I talked to him, I said,
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.000]  I'm going to drop the hammer. They're not going to stop.
[02:02:10.000 --> 02:02:12.000]  And so
[02:02:12.000 --> 02:02:14.000]  in his answer as well, Alex, you just
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:16.000]  don't stop. Keep fighting, fight as hard as you can.
[02:02:16.000 --> 02:02:18.000]  But that's the
[02:02:18.000 --> 02:02:20.000]  just imagine Kelly and Mattis
[02:02:20.000 --> 02:02:22.000]  would lie to him and tell him whatever he wanted
[02:02:22.000 --> 02:02:24.000]  to hear and then not go implement it.
[02:02:24.000 --> 02:02:26.000]  And then Kelly is on TV bragging
[02:02:26.000 --> 02:02:28.000]  that he would basically sabotage
[02:02:28.000 --> 02:02:30.000]  what the president wanted to do. It's just these guys
[02:02:30.000 --> 02:02:32.000]  are just jerks, but see
[02:02:32.000 --> 02:02:34.000]  they're cowards. They want
[02:02:34.000 --> 02:02:36.000]  their pension, they want their money
[02:02:36.000 --> 02:02:38.000]  and they sit there and laugh.
[02:02:38.000 --> 02:02:40.000]  But let me tell you something.
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:42.000]  The bylaw in D.C. is talk crap about
[02:02:42.000 --> 02:02:44.000]  Trump. Now he's an idiot.
[02:02:44.000 --> 02:02:46.000]  Even his supporters do it and it's pathetic.
[02:02:46.000 --> 02:02:48.000]  Anything else, Bob?
[02:02:48.000 --> 02:02:50.000]  I don't know where this is going to turn out,
[02:02:50.000 --> 02:02:52.000]  but I say bring it on.
[02:02:52.000 --> 02:02:54.000]  But the last
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:56.000]  t-shirt that I received from you was
[02:02:56.000 --> 02:02:58.000]  the
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.000]  Everybody's Alex Jones Don't Thread on Me.
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:02.000]  Yes. That is phenomenal.
[02:03:02.000 --> 02:03:04.000]  The only thing that could make it
[02:03:04.000 --> 02:03:06.000]  better is that if it was
[02:03:06.000 --> 02:03:08.000]  on the front and the back of the shirt
[02:03:08.000 --> 02:03:10.000]  because I want people to see it when I'm
[02:03:10.000 --> 02:03:12.000]  looking in their eyes
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:14.000]  and when I'm looking the other way, I wanted to
[02:03:14.000 --> 02:03:16.000]  see it. So that's just one
[02:03:16.000 --> 02:03:18.000]  No, I agree. In fact, I love that
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:20.000]  shirt. And I said, why isn't it put on the back? And they said
[02:03:20.000 --> 02:03:22.000]  boss, you're going to give these away free.
[02:03:22.000 --> 02:03:24.000]  They already cost like five
[02:03:24.000 --> 02:03:26.000]  bucks. So everything you print
[02:03:26.000 --> 02:03:28.000]  extras a few more dollars. But yes,
[02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:30.000]  it's funny you say that the next version
[02:03:30.000 --> 02:03:32.000]  because that was limited edition is coming
[02:03:32.000 --> 02:03:34.000]  out with info wars.com
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:36.000]  on the shoulder and American flag
[02:03:36.000 --> 02:03:38.000]  and info wars.com on the back. What do you
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:40.000]  want to say on the back?
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.000]  The same thing. Don't tread on me.
[02:03:42.000 --> 02:03:44.000]  We're all Alex Jones.
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:46.000]  All right, you are the designer. We're
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:48.000]  going to have that in the back. Don't
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:50.000]  we're all Alex Jones. Don't tread on me on the back. In fact,
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:52.000]  we'll put the same symbol on the back.
[02:03:52.000 --> 02:03:54.000]  Run in back. You got it.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:56.000]  You got it.
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:03:58.000]  All right, Dan Lyman, please
[02:03:58.000 --> 02:04:00.000]  come back on every week. I just want you
[02:04:00.000 --> 02:04:02.000]  on every week and you're on fire
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:04.000]  and you're a one man wrecking crew.
[02:04:04.000 --> 02:04:06.000]  I know you're trying to hire some more folks, but
[02:04:06.000 --> 02:04:08.000]  we're really blessed to have you in the
[02:04:08.000 --> 02:04:10.000]  last 60 seconds we have in this segment. What do
[02:04:10.000 --> 02:04:12.000]  you see coming in the new year?
[02:04:12.000 --> 02:04:14.000]  I do see an eventful year.
[02:04:14.000 --> 02:04:16.000]  Of course, things are only
[02:04:16.000 --> 02:04:18.000]  building momentum right now.
[02:04:18.000 --> 02:04:20.000]  And even tonight could be, of course, eventful
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:22.000]  in Paris. They have
[02:04:22.000 --> 02:04:24.000]  France in general, they're deploying almost
[02:04:24.000 --> 02:04:26.000]  150,000 security forces
[02:04:26.000 --> 02:04:28.000]  because they do anticipate continued
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:30.000]  protests and perhaps
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:32.000]  some, you know, just an escalation.
[02:04:32.000 --> 02:04:34.000]  So it's going to be an exciting year.
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:36.000]  We have the European Parliamentary
[02:04:36.000 --> 02:04:38.000]  elections coming this year. So the
[02:04:38.000 --> 02:04:40.000]  propaganda will be heavy and also
[02:04:40.000 --> 02:04:42.000]  the populist answer to that
[02:04:42.000 --> 02:04:44.000]  will be stiff as well, I'm sure.
[02:04:44.000 --> 02:04:46.000]  So it's going to be an eventful year in Europe
[02:04:46.000 --> 02:04:48.000]  and in the U.S., of course.
[02:04:48.000 --> 02:04:50.000]  Very well said. And again, all those security
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.000]  forces should be defending France's border.
[02:04:52.000 --> 02:04:54.000]  Instead, they're suppressing the people.
[02:04:54.000 --> 02:04:56.000]  So
[02:04:56.000 --> 02:04:58.000]  as we prepare to close out
[02:04:58.000 --> 02:05:00.000]  2018, just remember
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:02.000]  this life is a test.
[02:05:02.000 --> 02:05:04.000]  And those of you that have been listening
[02:05:04.000 --> 02:05:06.000]  and watching and taking action, the victories
[02:05:06.000 --> 02:05:08.000]  of populism and nationalism and Christianity
[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:10.000]  coming back from the dead and
[02:05:10.000 --> 02:05:12.000]  recognizing it's being persecuted, that's
[02:05:12.000 --> 02:05:14.000]  all because you are the core
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:16.000]  listening to M4 Wars around the world.
[02:05:16.000 --> 02:05:18.000]  The eyes and ears of liberty
[02:05:18.000 --> 02:05:20.000]  that were immune
[02:05:20.000 --> 02:05:22.000]  or at least resistant
[02:05:22.000 --> 02:05:24.000]  to globalist programming.
[02:05:24.000 --> 02:05:26.000]  Everybody knows
[02:05:26.000 --> 02:05:28.000]  who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:30.000]  who tend to be
[02:05:30.000 --> 02:05:32.000]  immune to the globalist brainwashing
[02:05:32.000 --> 02:05:34.000]  and who tend to see it. And that's why
[02:05:34.000 --> 02:05:36.000]  they're trying to eradicate you.
[02:05:36.000 --> 02:05:38.000]  But regardless, this fight is
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:40.000]  intensifying. 2018 has been
[02:05:40.000 --> 02:05:42.000]  insane. 2019 is
[02:05:42.000 --> 02:05:44.000]  going to be the big decision maker
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:46.000]  and I am so honored to be here
[02:05:46.000 --> 02:05:48.000]  with you right beside me.
[02:05:48.000 --> 02:05:50.000]  Not behind us, but right beside us and at the heart
[02:05:50.000 --> 02:05:52.000]  and resisting these globalists. So whatever you do
[02:05:52.000 --> 02:05:54.000]  take action and realize
[02:05:54.000 --> 02:06:22.000]  that this is a big history together and I salute you.
[02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:26.000]  We're about to be talking to
[02:06:26.000 --> 02:06:28.000]  Ian Ferguson
[02:06:28.000 --> 02:06:30.000]  of Georgia.
[02:06:30.000 --> 02:06:32.000]  He walked into
[02:06:32.000 --> 02:06:34.000]  a big vape chain
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:36.000]  and
[02:06:36.000 --> 02:06:38.000]  instantly began videotaping
[02:06:38.000 --> 02:06:40.000]  because he's wearing a
[02:06:40.000 --> 02:06:42.000]  make America great again hat.
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:44.000]  I like the black coat.
[02:06:44.000 --> 02:06:46.000]  I like the black coat.
[02:06:46.000 --> 02:06:48.000]  I like the black coat.
[02:06:48.000 --> 02:06:50.000]  I like the black coat.
[02:06:50.000 --> 02:06:52.000]  I like the black coat.
[02:06:52.000 --> 02:06:54.000]  I like the black coat.
[02:06:54.000 --> 02:06:56.000]  I want to wear them.
[02:06:56.000 --> 02:06:58.000]  I like the black coat.
[02:06:58.000 --> 02:07:00.000]  I want to wear them.
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:02.000]  And here's the beat version.
[02:07:02.000 --> 02:07:04.000]  We have the unbeat version on
[02:07:04.000 --> 02:07:06.000]  infowars.com.
[02:07:06.000 --> 02:07:08.000]  The Top Story.
[02:07:08.000 --> 02:07:10.000]  The Top Story.

[02:07:36.840 --> 02:07:41.000]  crazy and we can make some great memes out of this guy I'm thinking maybe we should
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:46.600]  do a meme contest with this guy because he squawks like some kind of weird ostrich or
[02:07:46.600 --> 02:07:55.040]  something I don't know what bird does this kind of a parrot he's like after a while he's
[02:07:55.040 --> 02:08:03.960]  just I mean it's like a duck crossed with a crazy ostrich or something crossed with

[02:14:27.520 --> 02:14:34.520]  why do you think he flipped out on you so bad just seeing a trumpet how about mainstream
[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:41.520]  media programming if you take a look at what is it the four majors five majors every one
[02:14:41.520 --> 02:14:48.440]  of them it was two owners amongst the news agencies along with paper and internet as
[02:14:48.440 --> 02:14:55.200]  well the message that is put out to the populace in general is tailor made they control the
[02:14:55.200 --> 02:15:02.040]  feelings and thoughts of the masses through fake news it is what it is you watch one news
[02:15:02.040 --> 02:15:09.520]  agency over the others and you can see that the draft just drastic difference between
[02:15:09.520 --> 02:15:13.720]  the two then you go take a look online you check out the conservative website check out
[02:15:13.720 --> 02:15:18.840]  some of the little stuff and the story that's put across is just completely different things
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:23.880]  that aren't even reported on you know I hear all of this about the wall and you know illegal
[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:30.520]  immigration and detention camps and I was talking to my extended family just the other
[02:15:30.520 --> 02:15:34.720]  night Christmas Eve as a matter of fact and blew their mind letting them know that the
[02:15:34.720 --> 02:15:40.040]  migrant caravan has over 50,000 people in it and a small portion of that is women and
[02:15:40.040 --> 02:15:44.200]  children she had no idea because the mainstream media doesn't know this is what I wanted to

[02:16:56.200 --> 02:17:00.120]  I started fighting the IRS over 40 years ago when they tried to seize my mother's house.
[02:17:00.120 --> 02:17:01.640]  I sued the IRS in one.
[02:17:01.640 --> 02:17:04.640]  I beat the IRS then and I've been beating them ever since.

[02:18:56.240 --> 02:19:00.320]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[02:19:00.320 --> 02:19:01.320]  law.
[02:19:01.320 --> 02:19:06.600]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact
[02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:10.480]  that the emperor has no clothes that can call BS, it's game over.
[02:19:10.480 --> 02:19:15.760]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[02:19:15.760 --> 02:19:20.000]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:19:20.000 --> 02:19:26.800]  There's only two groups in the U.S. Infowars and Matt Rudge of Rudge Report.com that are
[02:19:26.800 --> 02:19:27.800]  truly independent.
[02:19:27.800 --> 02:19:31.320]  And, of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[02:19:31.320 --> 02:19:33.240]  It really is amazing.
[02:19:33.240 --> 02:19:37.520]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing
[02:19:37.520 --> 02:19:39.920]  fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[02:19:39.920 --> 02:19:45.400]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of Infowars.
[02:19:45.400 --> 02:19:50.120]  So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswars.com, prisonplot.com.
[02:19:50.120 --> 02:19:53.400]  Because if you don't spread the articles in the videos, no one else will.
[02:19:53.400 --> 02:19:54.400]  We're all in each other's hands.
[02:19:54.400 --> 02:20:20.600]  God bless you all and thank you.
[02:20:20.600 --> 02:20:22.120]  Our guest is with us for one more segment.
[02:20:22.120 --> 02:20:24.800]  Then it's wall-to-wall calls and news after that.
[02:20:24.800 --> 02:20:32.400]  And then hosting the fourth hour, going to have one of the top censored comedians in
[02:20:32.400 --> 02:20:33.400]  the country joining us.
[02:20:33.400 --> 02:20:34.920]  I guess that's on Wednesday.
[02:20:34.920 --> 02:20:39.360]  Mike Adams is hosting the fourth hour today, always informative, always powerful.
[02:20:39.360 --> 02:20:44.000]  He was on fire last Friday's show.
[02:20:44.000 --> 02:20:45.360]  But you were on a roll.
[02:20:45.360 --> 02:20:50.040]  You were laying out your political views, talking to family that people aren't aware.
[02:20:50.040 --> 02:20:53.720]  They see the news cropping photos showing a few women and a few children.
[02:20:53.720 --> 02:20:55.280]  And we say, why aren't they allowed in?
[02:20:55.280 --> 02:21:01.880]  And every network won't show you tens of thousands breaking across barriers, child trafficking,
[02:21:01.880 --> 02:21:02.880]  drug dealing.
[02:21:02.880 --> 02:21:09.280]  So start over where you were at, sir.
[02:21:09.280 --> 02:21:10.680]  The migrant caravan specifically?
[02:21:10.680 --> 02:21:15.120]  You were talking to extended family over the holidays, over Christmas, and they were just
[02:21:15.120 --> 02:21:16.120]  blown away.
[02:21:16.120 --> 02:21:23.960]  Yeah, look, come to find out the things that they don't know, and it led me to realize
[02:21:23.960 --> 02:21:28.080]  that that's the vast majority of the populace that they get.
[02:21:28.080 --> 02:21:32.200]  The media's blanket is it covers everything.
[02:21:32.200 --> 02:21:38.000]  They get everybody, and they're controlling what is and isn't seen.
[02:21:38.000 --> 02:21:41.360]  So I realize that so many people just don't even know.
[02:21:41.360 --> 02:21:42.560]  They don't take the time to look.
[02:21:42.560 --> 02:21:47.320]  They're over it, the divide and the over-reporting of fake bullshit.
[02:21:47.320 --> 02:21:48.920]  Sorry, I'm part of my language.
[02:21:48.920 --> 02:21:49.920]  I won't try not to do that.
[02:21:49.920 --> 02:21:54.920]  Yeah, we have to delay it when you cuss, but hey, Lindsey Graham cusses, beat O'Rourke.
[02:21:54.920 --> 02:21:56.640]  Everybody gets to cuss on TV but me.
[02:21:56.640 --> 02:21:59.720]  So just, we're info wars, so we're not allowed to.
[02:21:59.720 --> 02:22:02.200]  Everybody else is allowed to now, but conservatives aren't.
[02:22:02.200 --> 02:22:05.240]  But I guess Lindsey Graham is, so, sorry, go ahead.
[02:22:05.240 --> 02:22:08.720]  Well, yeah, so I'm going to try and tone down the language.
[02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:09.720]  I'm sorry.
[02:22:09.720 --> 02:22:10.720]  We just talk however.
[02:22:10.720 --> 02:22:11.720]  No, no, it's okay.
[02:22:11.720 --> 02:22:12.720]  Good job.
[02:22:12.720 --> 02:22:13.720]  Go ahead.
[02:22:13.720 --> 02:22:14.720]  I don't know.
[02:22:14.720 --> 02:22:15.720]  Where are we at?
[02:22:15.720 --> 02:22:16.720]  The under-reporting.
[02:22:16.720 --> 02:22:17.720]  Yes.
[02:22:17.720 --> 02:22:19.000]  Okay, so here's where we're at in the world, right?
[02:22:19.000 --> 02:22:24.360]  We've got, just a couple years ago now, we had the sitting president pick his successor
[02:22:24.360 --> 02:22:31.120]  and then weaponize the DOJ, the IRS, Homeland Security, and weaponize the government against
[02:22:31.120 --> 02:22:32.120]  the opponent.
[02:22:32.120 --> 02:22:35.160]  That's where we're at as a nation right now.
[02:22:35.160 --> 02:22:39.960]  We're coming out of that culture slowly, and I know you like to go on and on and on
[02:22:39.960 --> 02:22:44.040]  about the deep state and, you know, that stuff at Christmas where I was realizing that they
[02:22:44.040 --> 02:22:48.000]  just don't hear, they don't know they're not interested.
[02:22:48.000 --> 02:22:50.720]  Even further than that, once you start talking about the deep state and how there's a whole
[02:22:50.720 --> 02:22:54.120]  mother shadow government trying to pull strings, they close their ears.
[02:22:54.120 --> 02:22:55.120]  It's not happening.
[02:22:55.120 --> 02:22:56.120]  They don't want to hear it.
[02:22:56.120 --> 02:23:01.200]  They want to believe that we're all racist, that we're all closet child molesters, pedophiles,
[02:23:01.200 --> 02:23:07.360]  that we're just monsters, that because we have conservative views, that we're more
[02:23:07.360 --> 02:23:14.200]  moderate in tone, less guided by our feelings than that we have no feelings at all, and
[02:23:14.200 --> 02:23:16.400]  that is so far from the truth.
[02:23:16.400 --> 02:23:20.600]  Well, that's well said, we're not as easy to manipulate.
[02:23:20.600 --> 02:23:25.840]  We know the game that's being played, and as you said about COG and all this, Obama,
[02:23:25.840 --> 02:23:31.200]  I remember when I knew the Democrats were beyond evil, it was like six years ago, Rachel
[02:23:31.200 --> 02:23:35.720]  Maddow goes, Republicans are filing lawsuits about the Tea Party, having its tax exemption
[02:23:35.720 --> 02:23:38.280]  taken away and churches being audited.
[02:23:38.280 --> 02:23:40.920]  She goes, of course they are, you're a racist.
[02:23:40.920 --> 02:23:46.040]  So they have the IRS persecuting people because they're Christian, or because they're conservative,
[02:23:46.040 --> 02:23:53.440]  they're now trying to ban Franklin Graham off Facebook, and it's crazy that they're doing
[02:23:53.440 --> 02:23:57.840]  this, and like you said, they've totally weaponized it, so just like they did that to conservatives
[02:23:57.840 --> 02:24:02.200]  for eight years under Obama, when Trump got in, they just said, keep it going, keep it
[02:24:02.200 --> 02:24:07.760]  going, and then that's the crime, and then there's so many cowards in D.C., Trump's getting
[02:24:07.760 --> 02:24:11.480]  the orders to arrest all these people, he's getting, you know what, no one will follow
[02:24:11.480 --> 02:24:13.520]  them because they're all cowards.
[02:24:13.520 --> 02:24:17.720]  I can't believe that if Trump had, and I'm not just bragging, it's true, a thousand people
[02:24:17.720 --> 02:24:23.920]  like you or me or Tucker Carlson or whatever, or Sean Hannity, it'd be over, because we,
[02:24:23.920 --> 02:24:26.640]  it's constitutional, it's true, we follow the order.
[02:24:26.640 --> 02:24:30.600]  He is surrounded by a bunch of damn double dealing cowards.
[02:24:30.600 --> 02:24:33.280]  What does he do then, Ian Ferguson?
[02:24:33.280 --> 02:24:37.200]  I couldn't even speak to the mind of Trump.
[02:24:37.200 --> 02:24:42.400]  They guys got a business hack him in that goes way beyond where I'm at.
[02:24:42.400 --> 02:24:44.840]  He constantly surprises me with his next move.
[02:24:44.840 --> 02:24:49.920]  No, I know, let's say he's a builder, he can't build steel building without steel, and these
[02:24:49.920 --> 02:24:55.120]  people tell them they're steel, they're a bunch of aluminum or plastic, they're all
[02:24:55.120 --> 02:25:01.800]  a bunch of, the reservoir of DC is a bunch of yes men and cowards, so he's surrounded,
[02:25:01.800 --> 02:25:05.440]  it's been, it's been proven by a bunch of liars that tell him to his face, yes sir,
[02:25:05.440 --> 02:25:08.360]  we'll do that, and they don't do a damn thing he says.
[02:25:08.360 --> 02:25:13.280]  Well, welcome to politics, I mean, it is what it is, you can't trust a politician, never
[02:25:13.280 --> 02:25:18.400]  could, and maybe that's why I like him so much, because he wasn't a politician, he still
[02:25:18.400 --> 02:25:25.080]  isn't, and I watch him fumble at times where a politician, somebody who's slick, slick mouth,
[02:25:25.080 --> 02:25:28.640]  would have slid right through there, you know, slick will he could have said it right, Obama
[02:25:28.640 --> 02:25:31.960]  could have orated his way through it, but Trump's just going to come through like a
[02:25:31.960 --> 02:25:37.960]  bowl in a china shop, because like you said, you've got to be strong, got to, and he's
[02:25:37.960 --> 02:25:41.080]  doing that for us, he puts on a strong front.
[02:25:41.080 --> 02:25:46.040]  You want somebody that's going to count how to other foreign leaders, let them dictate
[02:25:46.040 --> 02:25:50.360]  our policy, how we spend our money, or how we take care of our people?
[02:25:50.360 --> 02:25:57.360]  No, I want somebody that's going to stand up there, and run right through them, I wanted
[02:25:57.360 --> 02:26:01.880]  to say a phrase, but I don't know if I'm going to get edited over that either, you've
[02:26:01.880 --> 02:26:07.800]  got to stand up, we need a leader that's going to stand up, and we finally got one, and this
[02:26:07.800 --> 02:26:12.440]  uh, I don't know, this blanket they've cast over the media, they have done a great job
[02:26:12.440 --> 02:26:13.440]  of brainwashing.
[02:26:13.440 --> 02:26:18.400]  Oh, everything he does, they say the opposite, we can delay this for TV and radio, but since
[02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:22.520]  Lindsey Graham gets to shake us words on CNN, why can't you and everybody else does, but
[02:26:22.520 --> 02:26:25.000]  we're going to delay it for stations, but I don't want to censor you, so go ahead and
[02:26:25.000 --> 02:26:27.000]  say your phrase.
[02:26:27.000 --> 02:26:31.840]  Right, Trump said it best, grab them by the pussy, I want a leader that's going to stand
[02:26:31.840 --> 02:26:37.760]  up and do what needs to be done, take the hard hits, say the wrong thing, make them cry
[02:26:37.760 --> 02:26:43.200]  a little bit, shake them down to their core, and then get what you need out of the deal.
[02:26:43.200 --> 02:26:45.400]  This feelings, it's not a problem.
[02:26:45.400 --> 02:26:48.760]  No, it's true, they've gotten America to be a bunch of wimps, we can be run over by the
[02:26:48.760 --> 02:26:52.640]  chai comms, everybody else, and Trump's just saying, listen, the gang raping of America
[02:26:52.640 --> 02:26:57.040]  is over, and that's why I can't believe more people don't get behind him when it's so obvious
[02:26:57.040 --> 02:27:01.320]  that he had control for two years, barely the economy turned around, now they're killing
[02:27:01.320 --> 02:27:05.200]  it, they admit to hurt him, people should be angry.
[02:27:05.200 --> 02:27:10.400]  It should be, well they are, no, no, no, they are, but you're talking about the wrong group,
[02:27:10.400 --> 02:27:15.000]  well both groups are angry, all right, be legitimate about it, red, blue, everybody's
[02:27:15.000 --> 02:27:21.320]  pissed off for separate reasons, you know, the red group, they're pissed because, we're
[02:27:21.320 --> 02:27:27.680]  getting painted as racists, monsters, child molesters, racists, we hate everybody, we
[02:27:27.680 --> 02:27:31.680]  don't have any feelings, the blue groups pissed because they were raised where everybody gets
[02:27:31.680 --> 02:27:33.840]  a trophy and their candidate lost.
[02:27:33.840 --> 02:27:39.320]  No, I agree, and listen, I'm not for violence at the leftist, but I'm also not for rolling
[02:27:39.320 --> 02:27:44.080]  over, and so it's time to get back in their face, and I do it every day when they get
[02:27:44.080 --> 02:27:49.280]  in my face, and you're doing it, and I'm doing it, and we're done.
[02:27:49.280 --> 02:27:54.480]  These little brats that would wreck this country in a minute, that literally hate it, need
[02:27:54.480 --> 02:27:57.560]  to learn, we're not going anywhere, and I think they figured that out, I think we're
[02:27:57.560 --> 02:28:01.680]  going to outlast them long term, what do you think Ian Ferguson?
[02:28:01.680 --> 02:28:05.240]  More than anything, I think people need to sit down and have a conversation about it,
[02:28:05.240 --> 02:28:10.600]  you know, I spent a lot of my life getting in people's faces, and it led me to no good
[02:28:10.600 --> 02:28:16.400]  place, and sometimes the thing that's necessary is to sit down and see eye to eye, and I'll
[02:28:16.400 --> 02:28:17.680]  hash it out and speak about it.
[02:28:17.680 --> 02:28:20.800]  No, I would love to be able to hash it out with them, but they get in my face.
[02:28:20.800 --> 02:28:25.960]  Absolutely, and look, when somebody gets in your face, you put them on their ass, within
[02:28:25.960 --> 02:28:29.960]  arms reach is a threat, stay outside of it, we can talk about it.
[02:28:29.960 --> 02:28:34.040]  Well, I got to tell you, pop back in with us, I want to talk about you doing some reports
[02:28:34.040 --> 02:28:38.480]  for us, you should something with some ideas, and do that more, and we'll be talking soon,
[02:28:38.480 --> 02:28:46.720]  but good job keeping your cool, like you said, with that ginger snap, libtard, the vape head,
[02:28:46.720 --> 02:28:50.400]  and so we'll be following what you do, my friend, Ian Ferguson, have a good week and
[02:28:50.400 --> 02:28:55.120]  a new year, my friend.
[02:28:55.120 --> 02:29:00.520]  The United States of Empire is a book that claims the United States is the empire of
[02:29:00.520 --> 02:29:01.520]  the world.
[02:29:01.520 --> 02:29:06.920]  George Washington had warned us against foreign wars, the United States of Empire shows that
[02:29:06.920 --> 02:29:10.480]  World Wars One and Two left England broken.
[02:29:10.480 --> 02:29:14.320]  Its former colony, the US, had to save the empire.
[02:29:14.320 --> 02:29:15.320]  Was there ever a vote?
[02:29:15.320 --> 02:29:16.840]  Who do we fight for?
[02:29:16.840 --> 02:29:23.400]  The deep state began with World War One, the United States of Empire by James Dunne, available
[02:29:23.400 --> 02:29:25.200]  at Amazon Books.
[02:29:25.200 --> 02:29:28.160]  At wolfhillamo.com, we love shotguns.

[02:29:53.280 --> 02:29:56.280]  Wolfhillamo.com
[02:29:56.280 --> 02:30:00.400]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the
[02:30:00.400 --> 02:30:06.720]  law if there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact
[02:30:06.720 --> 02:30:10.720]  that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS if game over.
[02:30:10.720 --> 02:30:15.880]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[02:30:15.880 --> 02:30:20.160]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:30:20.160 --> 02:30:26.920]  There's only two groups in the US, Info Wars and Matt Rudge of Rudge Report.com that are
[02:30:26.920 --> 02:30:27.920]  truly independent.
[02:30:27.920 --> 02:30:31.400]  And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[02:30:31.400 --> 02:30:33.320]  It really is amazing.
[02:30:33.320 --> 02:30:37.600]  That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing
[02:30:37.600 --> 02:30:40.000]  fight we're all in and how far we've come together.
[02:30:40.000 --> 02:30:45.480]  Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will of Info Wars.
[02:30:45.480 --> 02:30:50.200]  So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswars.com, christenpudda.com.
[02:30:50.200 --> 02:30:53.480]  Because if you don't spread the articles in the videos, no one else will.
[02:30:53.480 --> 02:30:54.480]  We're all in each other's hands.
[02:30:54.480 --> 02:30:56.480]  God bless you all and thank you.
[02:30:56.480 --> 02:30:58.880]  We all know the importance of fish oils.
[02:30:58.880 --> 02:31:02.960]  While we are sure to provide them for ourselves, it's just as important to make sure your kids
[02:31:02.960 --> 02:31:05.360]  get their EPA and DHA too.
[02:31:05.360 --> 02:31:09.480]  Honor Roll is a powerful DHA fish oil formula for your child.
[02:31:09.480 --> 02:31:13.280]  Built from the ground up to support your child's development.
[02:31:13.280 --> 02:31:19.720]  This formula uses wild anchovy fish oil, ultra purified krill oil and wild salmon fish oil
[02:31:19.720 --> 02:31:22.920]  with vitamins to boost your child's mind and body.
[02:31:22.920 --> 02:31:28.480]  This fish oil formula, you can support your child's optimal heart, joint, cognitive and
[02:31:28.480 --> 02:31:33.200]  brain health while providing DHA, which has been shown to be essential for your child's
[02:31:33.200 --> 02:31:34.920]  brain growth spurts.
[02:31:34.920 --> 02:31:41.320]  Built on powerful ingredients with 580 milligrams of high DHA omega-3s, this formula is highly
[02:31:41.320 --> 02:31:44.640]  refined to eliminate nearly all heavy metals.
[02:31:44.640 --> 02:31:49.040]  If you're looking for a formula to help your child grow, look no further.
[02:31:49.040 --> 02:31:56.120]  Try Honor Roll from InfoWarsLife at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:31:56.120 --> 02:32:01.360]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[02:32:01.360 --> 02:32:03.240]  That's the globalist only hope.
[02:32:03.240 --> 02:32:07.120]  So when you support InfoWars, when you spread our articles and videos, when you buy products
[02:32:07.120 --> 02:32:11.400]  at InfoWarsStore.com, you are literally not just supporting InfoWars in free speech and
[02:32:11.400 --> 02:32:15.360]  standing in defiance against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people, but you are
[02:32:15.360 --> 02:32:20.480]  standing for your own future and your own best shot of having an early warning system in
[02:32:20.480 --> 02:32:22.720]  America to stand against these individuals.
[02:32:22.720 --> 02:32:26.880]  When you order products at InfoWarsStore.com, you fund not just an American revolution,
[02:32:26.880 --> 02:32:28.960]  but a global revolution against tyranny.
[02:32:28.960 --> 02:32:32.560]  And we have the biggest specials ever running throughout to the end of the year as part
[02:32:32.560 --> 02:32:34.680]  of a total store clearance.
[02:32:34.680 --> 02:32:37.160]  Every order gets a free t-shirt.
[02:32:37.160 --> 02:32:38.280]  Every order gets free shipping.
[02:32:38.280 --> 02:32:43.760]  Every order gets 50 to 75% off in total clearance, and that funding allows us to go into the
[02:32:43.760 --> 02:32:48.640]  new year on sure footing to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year to not
[02:32:48.640 --> 02:32:50.360]  just fight, but to expand.
[02:32:50.360 --> 02:32:51.360]  We're on the march.
[02:32:51.360 --> 02:32:52.360]  The empire's on the run.
[02:32:52.360 --> 02:32:53.360]  I salute you all.
[02:32:53.360 --> 02:33:19.360]  Please take action at InfoWarsStore.com.
[02:33:23.360 --> 02:33:50.320]  All right, now you guys have been really great.
[02:33:50.320 --> 02:33:54.200]  We have over 20 phone lines, so I got to like 10 calls earlier, but then we let all the
[02:33:54.200 --> 02:33:56.240]  lines be open, then people got to hold for an hour.
[02:33:56.240 --> 02:33:57.240]  So I apologize.
[02:33:57.240 --> 02:34:02.920]  We're going to get to Caleb who's been home the longest, and Jacob, and then Justin, and
[02:34:02.920 --> 02:34:06.480]  then Eric, and then right down the line to Craig and everybody else.
[02:34:06.480 --> 02:34:08.240]  I'm going to everybody right now.
[02:34:08.240 --> 02:34:13.520]  There's a story up on InfoWars.com that's crazy.
[02:34:13.520 --> 02:34:15.480]  We don't just have NPR here in Austin.
[02:34:15.480 --> 02:34:17.600]  We don't just have UT Student Radio.
[02:34:17.600 --> 02:34:24.160]  They have another one that's basically government run, and it's not student.
[02:34:24.160 --> 02:34:25.160]  It's a co-op.
[02:34:25.160 --> 02:34:31.080]  And over the holidays, it's been airing demonic baby sacrifice music.
[02:34:31.080 --> 02:34:32.160]  I'm not kidding.
[02:34:32.160 --> 02:34:33.640]  We recorded it.
[02:34:33.640 --> 02:34:35.160]  This is what's been going on.
[02:34:35.160 --> 02:34:36.280]  Is this Christmas music?
[02:34:36.280 --> 02:34:39.920]  Austin radio station airs demonic sounds for hours.
[02:34:39.920 --> 02:34:40.920]  And we checked the schedule.
[02:34:40.920 --> 02:34:44.920]  This has been going on as just a blasphemy thing for Christmas.
[02:34:44.920 --> 02:34:51.920]  Remember, the left operating system is hating Christ, hating America.
[02:34:51.920 --> 02:34:52.920]  You name it.
[02:34:52.920 --> 02:34:56.000]  So that's going to be coming up right now.
[02:34:56.000 --> 02:34:58.360]  Let's go ahead and go back to your calls here.
[02:34:58.360 --> 02:35:01.800]  Actually, Jacob's been on the longest in Caleb.
[02:35:01.800 --> 02:35:04.040]  Jacob in Georgia, thanks for holding it on the air.
[02:35:04.040 --> 02:35:07.760]  Hey, Alex, appreciate you taking my call.
[02:35:07.760 --> 02:35:08.760]  First-time caller.
[02:35:08.760 --> 02:35:11.000]  I just want to get right to it.
[02:35:11.000 --> 02:35:14.680]  And the part, there's two dimensions to the InfoWars.
[02:35:14.680 --> 02:35:18.240]  One is informed and the other is inspired.
[02:35:18.240 --> 02:35:20.960]  And you are obviously the master of information.
[02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:22.360]  You're the general in the war.
[02:35:22.360 --> 02:35:24.200]  You've done the most work.
[02:35:24.200 --> 02:35:31.000]  I really think what we need to do in 2019, and this is the secret, is more inspiration.
[02:35:31.000 --> 02:35:34.320]  People are tired of both sides arguing and pointing out things.
[02:35:34.320 --> 02:35:36.000]  Oh, look, he said this.
[02:35:36.000 --> 02:35:37.320]  Oh, look, he said that.
[02:35:37.320 --> 02:35:38.320]  Jacob, let me stop you.
[02:35:38.320 --> 02:35:40.280]  I'm going to go right back to you.
[02:35:40.280 --> 02:35:45.680]  I was in the shower at 5.30 this morning and I said, Alex, you read the news, you get
[02:35:45.680 --> 02:35:46.680]  obsessed with it.
[02:35:46.680 --> 02:35:48.720]  You never cover your inspiration.
[02:35:48.720 --> 02:35:57.000]  You must go on air and say your 2019 New Year's resolution is to be positive and inspirational.
[02:35:57.000 --> 02:36:02.360]  They even said this some last week about what is good so we know what we're fighting for
[02:36:02.360 --> 02:36:03.520]  and I didn't do it.
[02:36:03.520 --> 02:36:07.440]  But you called in, which shows that that's the zeitgeist.
[02:36:07.440 --> 02:36:13.280]  You have my commitment, Jacob, that we are going to focus on the amazing and the positive
[02:36:13.280 --> 02:36:15.080]  at least half the time.
[02:36:15.080 --> 02:36:18.440]  For every negative thing we cover, we're going to cover something positive.
[02:36:18.440 --> 02:36:19.440]  Go ahead.
[02:36:19.440 --> 02:36:20.440]  Exactly.
[02:36:20.440 --> 02:36:23.960]  And that's the key, is now we have to create our own narrative.
[02:36:23.960 --> 02:36:27.000]  We have to brainwash and, like, chant it like a mantra.
[02:36:27.000 --> 02:36:31.480]  And the mantra is the future of each other, the future.
[02:36:31.480 --> 02:36:35.760]  Keep chanting it like a mantra until it programs the people.
[02:36:35.760 --> 02:36:40.920]  Actually that is what we need and it's like we have the technology right now to 3D print
[02:36:40.920 --> 02:36:45.960]  houses out of hemp concrete using robots to do it all autonomously.
[02:36:45.960 --> 02:36:50.480]  Why are we not building this future of this better future together as friends?
[02:36:50.480 --> 02:36:51.480]  We're all connected.
[02:36:51.480 --> 02:36:55.480]  We all have a cell phone in our hand that connects us around the world.
[02:36:55.480 --> 02:36:59.840]  Why isn't our government just an iPhone app that we just pull up and say, okay, I want
[02:36:59.840 --> 02:37:01.400]  to vote for him?
[02:37:01.400 --> 02:37:02.400]  Here's where my...
[02:37:02.400 --> 02:37:07.440]  Because it's a bunch of control freaks, even top scientists, geopolitical scientists have
[02:37:07.440 --> 02:37:12.320]  admitted that we have a ruling global elite that stir up problems so they're needed.
[02:37:12.320 --> 02:37:16.340]  Instead of just get out of the way, then there'll be unlimited resources, which is true.
[02:37:16.340 --> 02:37:20.640]  We are at the point of unlimited resources and the globalists are working around the
[02:37:20.640 --> 02:37:25.240]  clock to suppress all the real technologies that would bring us that.
[02:37:25.240 --> 02:37:26.240]  Exactly.
[02:37:26.240 --> 02:37:28.240]  So quit talking about their narrative.
[02:37:28.240 --> 02:37:31.720]  You and George keep pulling up what they're saying.
[02:37:31.720 --> 02:37:35.520]  For them, the easiest way to make a bully quit bullying you is ignore him.
[02:37:35.520 --> 02:37:36.520]  Don't fight back.
[02:37:36.520 --> 02:37:38.080]  Just be like, you don't exist.
[02:37:38.080 --> 02:37:39.080]  Your ideas...
[02:37:39.080 --> 02:37:41.280]  But I think there's a balance to both of it because you've got to have intel on what
[02:37:41.280 --> 02:37:42.280]  they're doing.
[02:37:42.280 --> 02:37:44.440]  But I've been seeing that all over the comments on InfoWars.
[02:37:44.440 --> 02:37:50.200]  People are like, Alex, don't spend a segment and a half on young Turks lying about you
[02:37:50.200 --> 02:37:51.200]  saying you're...
[02:37:51.200 --> 02:37:56.320]  Because the young Turks go on here and go, Jones admits he's fake, Jones admits everything
[02:37:56.320 --> 02:37:59.040]  he says is a lie, and then they don't show where I said it.
[02:37:59.040 --> 02:38:03.240]  So I get mad to say they're liars, but people go, Alex, we know they're liars.
[02:38:03.240 --> 02:38:04.800]  You don't need to defend yourself.
[02:38:04.800 --> 02:38:09.280]  And I guess that's why they attack me and lie about me constantly is so that I'll be
[02:38:09.280 --> 02:38:11.920]  defending myself instead of just getting the news out.
[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:12.920]  Yeah.
[02:38:12.920 --> 02:38:14.960]  And trust me, we all love you.
[02:38:14.960 --> 02:38:18.600]  And the reason you're so successful is because the whole world just needs a daddy.
[02:38:18.600 --> 02:38:19.600]  They need a coach.
[02:38:19.600 --> 02:38:25.200]  They need a strong male voice to tell them quit being a bitch, suck it up, get up, and
[02:38:25.200 --> 02:38:27.320]  let's work together and let's do a good job.
[02:38:27.320 --> 02:38:28.320]  And you're good.
[02:38:28.320 --> 02:38:33.120]  You have the voice for it, but yes, you do get wrapped up in negativity, which is you're
[02:38:33.120 --> 02:38:37.600]  basically playing the same game, screw their game, make up your new game, the new game.
[02:38:37.600 --> 02:38:41.360]  Well, I agree we got to fight them and we got to resist them, but we do have to understand
[02:38:41.360 --> 02:38:45.680]  while we're doing that, like that there's a beautiful world and so much good and not
[02:38:45.680 --> 02:38:46.680]  give them so much power.
[02:38:46.680 --> 02:38:47.680]  You know what?
[02:38:47.680 --> 02:38:48.680]  God bless you.
[02:38:48.680 --> 02:38:49.680]  I appreciate your call.
[02:38:49.680 --> 02:38:50.680]  Please call back again, Jacob.
[02:38:50.680 --> 02:38:55.160]  I told the crew this, I got show up shut during the midterms that it was my job to come up
[02:38:55.160 --> 02:38:59.120]  with the information which we had to get it out there.
[02:38:59.120 --> 02:39:00.800]  I wasn't worried about being censored ourselves.
[02:39:00.800 --> 02:39:03.880]  I knew that I'd been taken out of the game partially because they knew that we had the
[02:39:03.880 --> 02:39:04.880]  answer.
[02:39:04.880 --> 02:39:06.000]  So I was thinking, what is it?
[02:39:06.000 --> 02:39:07.000]  What is it?
[02:39:07.000 --> 02:39:08.000]  What is it?
[02:39:08.000 --> 02:39:09.480]  You know, what do I do with what they're doing?
[02:39:09.480 --> 02:39:11.640]  I'm, you know, what do I expose?
[02:39:11.640 --> 02:39:13.080]  How do I expose it to beat them?
[02:39:13.080 --> 02:39:15.840]  Like I had to beat it and I got totally upset.
[02:39:15.840 --> 02:39:17.160]  I never get demoralized and depressed.
[02:39:17.160 --> 02:39:22.560]  I got depressed and I was being a jerk to the crew and then when we lost the midterms
[02:39:22.560 --> 02:39:26.480]  because of fraud, I realized it's all a process, we're winning all over the world.
[02:39:26.480 --> 02:39:28.400]  And so I've been in a lot better mood since then.
[02:39:28.400 --> 02:39:29.400]  It's true.
[02:39:29.400 --> 02:39:30.920]  They win if we have a heart attack.
[02:39:30.920 --> 02:39:32.360]  They got David Knight really down, man.
[02:39:32.360 --> 02:39:34.600]  He's been really upset about the country.
[02:39:34.600 --> 02:39:35.600]  He really cares.
[02:39:35.600 --> 02:39:38.720]  And I was giving him a pep talk last week for we had that big heart attack and I was
[02:39:38.720 --> 02:39:39.720]  like, dude, take some time off.
[02:39:39.720 --> 02:39:42.800]  But he was just, he wasn't worried about himself being censored.
[02:39:42.800 --> 02:39:43.800]  He's a smart guy.
[02:39:43.800 --> 02:39:46.320]  He, you know, he's been around the world, done a lot of stuff.
[02:39:46.320 --> 02:39:48.520]  He was really, it's normal.
[02:39:48.520 --> 02:39:50.000]  You get upset by this.
[02:39:50.000 --> 02:39:54.840]  But it's like Nietzsche said, you can't stare into the abyss and become it.
[02:39:54.840 --> 02:39:58.640]  You got to like, look at it, know what it is and then fight it, but be of good cheer.
[02:39:58.640 --> 02:40:02.280]  And you're absolutely right because there's no doubt I'm going to end up having a heart
[02:40:02.280 --> 02:40:06.400]  attack and die by the time I'm 55 or something if I keep this up because I genuinely get
[02:40:06.400 --> 02:40:07.400]  pissed.
[02:40:07.400 --> 02:40:12.080]  I mean, I, you know, it's not an act and it's embarrassing, you know, to get this mad.
[02:40:12.080 --> 02:40:15.320]  So I had Lib Tards confront me this weekend and I just basically said, well, God bless
[02:40:15.320 --> 02:40:16.320]  you.
[02:40:16.320 --> 02:40:17.320]  Thank you.
[02:40:17.320 --> 02:40:21.460]  I just saw them as the dumb victims they are, instead of blowing up at them and you're
[02:40:21.460 --> 02:40:23.960]  absolutely right and your advice is well taken.
[02:40:23.960 --> 02:40:26.980]  Now let's cover some Hollywood pedophile rings.
[02:40:26.980 --> 02:40:30.000]  I mean, at the same time, we've got to cover these people.
[02:40:30.000 --> 02:40:31.000]  What?
[02:40:31.000 --> 02:40:34.800]  You think I'm not sick of talking about them if there was some free country that wasn't
[02:40:34.800 --> 02:40:38.640]  run by a bunch of damn devil worshippers, I'd be leaving right now.
[02:40:38.640 --> 02:40:40.160]  There's nowhere to go.
[02:40:40.160 --> 02:40:42.060]  So see, I say you're right.
[02:40:42.060 --> 02:40:42.960]  Then I start getting angry.
[02:40:42.960 --> 02:40:44.280]  I, it's a balance.
[02:40:44.280 --> 02:40:49.960]  And that's why we got to ask God into our lives every day and just the calming.
[02:40:51.160 --> 02:40:55.240]  Sometimes I can't sleep at night. I get so angry about this and just I have to pray
[02:40:55.240 --> 02:40:58.680]  and ask God to make me calm. And then that's why I can go to sleep. And I just hear kind
[02:40:58.680 --> 02:41:02.040]  like waves hitting the beach. It's like, it's all right. It's all part of the plan.
[02:41:02.680 --> 02:41:07.880]  So they can be okay. But I think about people that don't care. I don't want to be them though.
[02:41:08.600 --> 02:41:12.680]  Like people that just don't care or they enjoy being evil. Can you imagine being them?
[02:41:12.680 --> 02:41:19.240]  I mean, it's all food for thought. That's a whole other subject for a long debate on the
[02:41:19.240 --> 02:41:24.040]  show with callers about, isn't it positive to cover bad things that are happening because
[02:41:24.040 --> 02:41:28.760]  you believe people will change it? The establishment always goes, no, you're just demoralizing people
[02:41:28.760 --> 02:41:34.600]  with the bad news. Well, is that true? Because I always thought if something bad's happening,
[02:41:34.600 --> 02:41:39.000]  like if my neighbor's house is getting broken into, I'm going to go over and, you know,
[02:41:39.000 --> 02:41:43.880]  call the police and I'm going to put a deer rifle beat on them in case they, you know,
[02:41:45.000 --> 02:41:49.080]  try to hurt anybody. And that's a positive thing that I'm going to take action.
[02:41:49.720 --> 02:41:53.880]  It's not a negative thing, but I'm pontificating. Let's go back to your calls.
[02:41:53.880 --> 02:41:57.160]  So I took one call in that segment. This is a call. It was a good caller,
[02:41:58.600 --> 02:42:02.200]  but I just didn't do it again. Mike Adams is coming up, but he's cool to be pushed back
[02:42:02.760 --> 02:42:07.080]  one way or the other. I'm going to Caleb. I'm going to Justin. I'm going to Eric.
[02:42:07.080 --> 02:42:12.520]  I'm going to Craig. I'm going to D Ray Janice Lee James and Parker.
[02:42:13.640 --> 02:42:15.800]  Probably take me 15 minutes to the next hour, but I'm going to do it.
[02:42:16.520 --> 02:42:20.600]  So when I overbook guests, overbook calls, I don't even do one thing that's very critical.
[02:42:20.600 --> 02:42:25.800]  And that's plug folks. You've really come through in the last year, despite all the attacks you have
[02:42:25.800 --> 02:42:29.320]  provided for us. You have bought the products and gotten great products at the same time.
[02:42:29.320 --> 02:42:34.440]  You've done it. And this is the last chance because we were about to sell out and have sold
[02:42:34.440 --> 02:42:38.840]  out a lot of great products, but we have store-wide free shipping, 50, 75% off double
[02:42:38.840 --> 02:42:42.840]  Patriot points to your next order and a free gets in every order. And it's a year in special. So
[02:42:43.480 --> 02:42:48.280]  it should end tomorrow. It should end today, but I haven't done the special yet, but it's
[02:42:48.280 --> 02:42:51.560]  going to end the next few days. So thanks for your support, but get in there and get some more
[02:42:51.560 --> 02:42:58.120]  products. Thank you. We'll be right back. The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate
[02:42:58.120 --> 02:43:03.480]  world government that's above the law. If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media
[02:43:03.480 --> 02:43:09.320]  that can call the fact that the emperor has no close, they can call BS if game over.
[02:43:10.360 --> 02:43:14.840]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[02:43:14.840 --> 02:43:18.680]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[02:43:19.560 --> 02:43:24.840]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Info Wars and Matt Rudge of rudgereport.com
[02:43:25.480 --> 02:43:29.960]  that are truly independent. And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[02:43:29.960 --> 02:43:36.200]  It really is amazing. That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the
[02:43:36.200 --> 02:43:40.280]  amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together. Just remind you that you are the power,
[02:43:40.280 --> 02:43:46.600]  you're the strength, you're the will of Info Wars. So please spread the links. InfoWars.com,
[02:43:46.600 --> 02:43:51.160]  NewsWars.com, PrisonPlanet.com, because if you don't spread the articles, the video is no one
[02:43:51.160 --> 02:43:55.640]  else will. We're all in each other's hands. God bless you all and thank you. Whether you're
[02:43:55.640 --> 02:44:00.600]  looking to boost the benefits of our fish oil formula or just want an alternative, InfoWars

[02:44:46.360 --> 02:44:51.960]  what krill oil can do for you with Ultimate Krill Oil, now available at infowarsstore.com.
[02:44:56.120 --> 02:45:01.240]  For those of us that are the tip of the spear, we're being targeted to take out the leadership.
[02:45:01.240 --> 02:45:05.800]  That's the globalist only hope. So when you support InfoWars, when you spread our articles and
[02:45:05.800 --> 02:45:10.440]  videos, when you buy products at infowarsstore.com, you are literally not just supporting InfoWars
[02:45:10.440 --> 02:45:14.920]  in free speech and standing in defiance against Soros and Hillary and the rest of these people,
[02:45:14.920 --> 02:45:20.520]  but you are standing for your own future and your own best shot of having an early warning system
[02:45:20.520 --> 02:45:24.680]  in America to stand against these individuals. When you order products at infowarsstore.com,
[02:45:24.680 --> 02:45:28.840]  you fund not just an American revolution, but a global revolution against tyranny.
[02:45:28.840 --> 02:45:32.840]  And we have the biggest specials ever running throughout to the end of the year as part of a
[02:45:32.840 --> 02:45:38.360]  total store clearance. Every order gets a free t-shirt, every order gets free shipping, every
[02:45:38.360 --> 02:45:44.360]  order gets 50 to 75% off in total clearance, and that funding allows us to go into the new year
[02:45:44.360 --> 02:45:49.320]  on sure footing to fund ourselves throughout the first part of the year to not just fight,
[02:45:49.320 --> 02:45:53.880]  but to expand. We're on the march, the empire's on the run. I salute you all. Now please take
[02:45:53.880 --> 02:45:59.720]  action at infowarsstore.com. Please, whatever you do, realize that we're all getting punch drunk
[02:45:59.720 --> 02:46:04.600]  to the censorship and you saw 18 Twitter accounts, they say affiliated with InfoWars. Yes, some of
[02:46:04.600 --> 02:46:08.440]  them are like little side accounts. They even know we had like InfoWars stores that just showed
[02:46:08.440 --> 02:46:13.640]  our products, but they just banned them all yesterday in punishment that I be at a Trump rally
[02:46:13.640 --> 02:46:17.960]  and be mobbed by all these folks that loved us. Your excitement about America, your excitement
[02:46:17.960 --> 02:46:22.120]  about this broadcast is what brought the country and the world back from the brink. But the globalists
[02:46:22.120 --> 02:46:27.400]  now want to target where the resistance came from so that we're not pesky in the future.
[02:46:27.400 --> 02:46:33.880]  I want to be troublesome and pesky. I want to keep going. I want to make them do the ultimate,
[02:46:33.880 --> 02:46:39.240]  not just destroy us financially. I want to push all the way. I've committed to do that. I've prayed
[02:46:39.240 --> 02:46:44.280]  for that and I've been told that's going to happen, but you've got to back us and I promise you this.
[02:46:44.280 --> 02:46:48.920]  I will never falter. I will never waver at the spiritual level. I physically will,
[02:46:48.920 --> 02:46:54.200]  but I give you my commitment if you financially support us at infowarsstore.com to give you my
[02:46:54.200 --> 02:47:23.960]  absolute total commitment. It's amazing. It's amazing how you can speak
[02:47:23.960 --> 02:47:31.080]  right. You know, I was thinking a month ago, I talked about this, how Sundar Pachari is a total
[02:47:31.080 --> 02:47:39.000]  scapegoat for Larry Page. And now the Wolf Street Journal is reporting on that. Oh, Larry Page has
[02:47:39.000 --> 02:47:44.680]  been making deals with the chatcoms and selling the country out. And he doesn't want to go to
[02:47:44.680 --> 02:47:52.200]  prison if it doesn't go the way he thinks it's going to go. All right, let's go right back to
[02:47:52.200 --> 02:47:58.520]  your phone calls here. Who's been holding longer? Let's go ahead and talk to Justin and George.
[02:47:58.520 --> 02:48:03.960]  Justin, thanks for holding it on the air. Go ahead. Yes, sir. God bless you and God bless
[02:48:03.960 --> 02:48:08.520]  everybody. It's part of the info war. If it wasn't for that, we'd be in a real big mess.
[02:48:08.520 --> 02:48:12.040]  Well, that's what's scary. I mean, we're not bragging. You're not bragging. The listeners,
[02:48:12.040 --> 02:48:16.920]  the audience are info wars. If it wasn't for us, if it wasn't for you, imagine how bad it'd be
[02:48:16.920 --> 02:48:22.360]  right now. Seriously. And that's not like a power trip. That's scary as hell. That's right. And
[02:48:22.360 --> 02:48:28.520]  here's one of my my ideas about why it is so bad and maybe overlooked. I believe part of the
[02:48:28.520 --> 02:48:33.160]  reason the liberal brain is the way it is is due to all the pharmaceutical poisons being pushed by
[02:48:33.160 --> 02:48:39.800]  the FDA and all those agencies like that, that just pump poisons into people and it takes your
[02:48:39.800 --> 02:48:45.560]  morals and your soul away from you. And you're just a zombie. Well, the Bible says it that those
[02:48:45.560 --> 02:48:50.360]  that take pharmacia become possessed. And I've been around enough people that take prescription
[02:48:50.360 --> 02:48:57.160]  drugs that are crazier than anybody I ever knew that was on illegal drugs. And it's true. We all
[02:48:57.160 --> 02:49:01.800]  know what nice guys can do when they're drunk. Well, take that 10 times worse. And you're right.
[02:49:01.800 --> 02:49:07.560]  The average leftist is something like four times more likely to be on a psychotropic. And the
[02:49:07.560 --> 02:49:14.920]  psychotropic insert says delusions of grandeur, mania, depression, suicidal tendencies, violent
[02:49:14.920 --> 02:49:22.840]  outbursts, psychosis, psychotic activity. I mean, these damn pills will make you crazier than a,
[02:49:22.840 --> 02:49:29.000]  you know what? Yes, sir, sure will. And then when you see them going after things that are natural
[02:49:29.000 --> 02:49:35.560]  like Kratom and CBD and marijuana that actually help and there can be obtained very cheaply
[02:49:35.560 --> 02:49:40.840]  without all the BS involved. And they're fighting just there. They're damned us to take that away
[02:49:40.840 --> 02:49:46.840]  from people that is really helping. And that's a real shame. No, absolutely right, sir. The FDA,
[02:49:46.840 --> 02:49:50.760]  because now that he has as unleashed hemp, thank goodness and thank God,
[02:49:51.800 --> 02:49:57.800]  if that is going to open an entire industry, I mean, so many jobs are going to be going to
[02:49:57.800 --> 02:50:03.480]  be opened up because of this, but the FDA is going to be in his way and he better get a hold of them.
[02:50:03.480 --> 02:50:07.480]  Well, you notice what you're saying is totally true. He's against deadly stuff like OPM
[02:50:07.480 --> 02:50:12.040]  and synthetic things because he knows it's done a lot of bad. But then he looks at industrial
[02:50:12.040 --> 02:50:16.600]  hemp that everybody else has is better than cotton and he signed that bill and signed an order
[02:50:16.600 --> 02:50:20.440]  and he's given it back to the states. Something Obama said he would do but didn't do
[02:50:20.440 --> 02:50:27.320]  to decriminalize marijuana. And he's trying to fix the criminal justice system for nonviolent
[02:50:27.320 --> 02:50:32.440]  offenders. He's trying to pull out of these wars. Everything the Democrats said they'd kill for,
[02:50:32.440 --> 02:50:38.760]  but now they're against it. No appreciation of legalizing hemp. No appreciation of decriminalizing
[02:50:38.760 --> 02:50:45.000]  marijuana. No appreciation of trying to end these wars. No appreciation of the lowest black
[02:50:45.000 --> 02:50:49.560]  unemployment ever. No appreciation of getting factories built in all these poor areas, black,
[02:50:49.560 --> 02:50:54.360]  white, you name it. No appreciation. And that's why they're so scared of Trump because Trump is for
[02:50:54.360 --> 02:51:00.680]  real. Yes, sir. And some other things that I would, I would suggest is he audit and end the
[02:51:00.680 --> 02:51:06.040]  federal reserve, the private banking cartel, the creature from Jekyll Island that was created a
[02:51:06.040 --> 02:51:10.920]  year after the Titanic sank with most of the people that were the richest people opposed to it. Oh,
[02:51:10.920 --> 02:51:17.320]  there's no doubt they blew that boat to kill those people. That's a fact. Yes, sir. That's right.
[02:51:17.320 --> 02:51:21.800]  They report it wasn't just hitting that iceberg. The whole thing was a setup. All right, God bless
[02:51:21.800 --> 02:51:27.560]  you. Great points, my friend. Here's the bottom line for the new year. Trump better go into full
[02:51:27.560 --> 02:51:31.880]  war mode or he's done and so are we. And he's doing it. He's getting rid of all these traders.
[02:51:31.880 --> 02:51:36.440]  He's not listening to them. The media is like, oh my gosh, he's going over this gut. We're in
[02:51:36.440 --> 02:51:40.680]  danger. Colbert is like, good, go with your gut. It'll destroy you. Colbert, the guy that's saying
[02:51:40.680 --> 02:51:47.560]  never be president. So, you know, Trump gets it though. Doing the right thing is what God wants
[02:51:47.560 --> 02:51:54.840]  to see no matter what the outcome is. It's about decisions we make, not even outcomes. And the
[02:51:54.840 --> 02:51:58.280]  more dialed in you get, the more you realize that. And then when you make the right decision,
[02:51:58.840 --> 02:52:03.480]  then things almost always seem to go your way, but you got to do it for the right reason.
[02:52:04.280 --> 02:52:09.000]  And the media spends this that I'm fatalistic or I have this death wish. When I say I'm ready to die,
[02:52:09.640 --> 02:52:16.840]  I feel closer to God than ever. I added that I don't want to die, but that I'm confident.
[02:52:17.720 --> 02:52:21.640]  And I'm ready to die if I need to. And I don't just say that. I mean, I'm really ready.
[02:52:21.640 --> 02:52:27.880]  But they can put a gun to my head and say, renounce what you say. And I'm just, no, I'm just,
[02:52:28.520 --> 02:52:34.360]  it's a really good feeling. And you really start living at that point. And I look at all these
[02:52:34.360 --> 02:52:42.520]  other so-called men out there who go along with the system, but it's because they're not school
[02:52:42.520 --> 02:52:47.960]  teachers. They're not auto mechanics. They're not firefighters. They're not truck drivers. They're
[02:52:47.960 --> 02:52:56.120]  not machinists. They're not whoever they are doing their own independent life in their own system.
[02:52:56.120 --> 02:53:00.440]  They went through systems where if you don't do what you're told, you don't go up the chain of
[02:53:00.440 --> 02:53:06.120]  command. And so we wonder why we're in so much trouble. It's this centralized top down thing.
[02:53:06.120 --> 02:53:12.680]  Trump came from his own place. His dad was an anti-globalist insider in the Liberty Movement,
[02:53:12.680 --> 02:53:16.600]  but not an insider in the establishment. And so I know why they're so scared of Trump.
[02:53:16.600 --> 02:53:26.120]  His lawyer and his confidant for 25 years was Roy Cohn. The brains behind trying to stop the
[02:53:26.120 --> 02:53:31.160]  communist takeover of the U.S., who they demonize and call the worst man ever. And once he was dying
[02:53:31.160 --> 02:53:36.520]  of cancer, they disbarred him. Roy Cohn was a great guy. That's why they say he was the dirtiest
[02:53:36.520 --> 02:53:46.280]  guy I ever lived. Total crap. Absolute bull. The architect of McCarthyism that was been proven that
[02:53:46.280 --> 02:53:50.680]  the Russians declassified it all. It was totally real. So when they say Trump's a Russian agent,
[02:53:50.680 --> 02:53:59.080]  it's a sick joke, folks. He sat at the knee of McCarthy's boss. It was Roy Cohn, folks.
[02:54:00.520 --> 02:54:05.720]  That's why there's more than 20 movies putting down Roy Cohn. He advised Barry Goldwater.
[02:54:05.720 --> 02:54:11.960]  He advised Larry McDonald who they killed. He advised Ronald Reagan.
[02:54:11.960 --> 02:54:19.080]  And he had the top Pentagon people that weren't communists telling him these big Carnegie
[02:54:19.080 --> 02:54:23.960]  foundations and Rockefellers are going to set up Russia and China against us and they're going to
[02:54:23.960 --> 02:54:26.920]  turn all the kids against their families and they're going to break up everything and we're
[02:54:26.920 --> 02:54:35.320]  not going to put up with it. And the minute McCarthy figured out the minute and said the U.S.
[02:54:35.320 --> 02:54:42.360]  Army's been ordered to prop up the Soviet Union, they came after him, destroyed him in the media.
[02:54:43.160 --> 02:54:47.640]  So there's Donald Trump's lawyer of your TV viewer with Joseph McCarthy, an incredibly
[02:54:47.640 --> 02:54:52.920]  honorable patriotic man. But you read the history books. He's the worst person ever. Well, you know
[02:54:52.920 --> 02:54:56.760]  what? When I'm dead, if we don't beat these people, it's going to be that I'm the worst guy ever. It's
[02:54:56.760 --> 02:55:05.960]  not true. So you know when somebody's good because he's liars talk about him. Donald Trump's dad was
[02:55:05.960 --> 02:55:11.160]  one of the secret funders of the John Burt society from the start. Donald Trump's dad
[02:55:12.360 --> 02:55:18.760]  got arrested and the records got expunged. He beat up. He got attacked by 10 communists
[02:55:20.200 --> 02:55:25.800]  in the 1950s who were actually beating up a police officer and he kicked all their asses
[02:55:25.800 --> 02:55:30.200]  and then the leftist police came and arrested him. That's where Donald Trump comes from.
[02:55:31.000 --> 02:55:36.920]  And I know all the inside baseball folks. I know all the people. I had family involved
[02:55:36.920 --> 02:55:45.160]  with the whole deal, back with McDonald and all of it. Okay. I grew up. I already knew the,
[02:55:45.160 --> 02:55:48.200]  I didn't even know I was getting the reality when I was a little kid. And by the way,
[02:55:48.200 --> 02:55:54.360]  they weren't even telling me. I was sitting there listening. Little did I know I was literally
[02:55:54.360 --> 02:55:59.640]  getting a crash course in how the whole inch a lot of operates. And the reason I know how the
[02:55:59.640 --> 02:56:07.000]  whole inch a lot of operates is because the people in our government who weren't traders in 1949
[02:56:08.600 --> 02:56:16.040]  saw them kill US spies and operatives by the thousands inside China to put Mao in
[02:56:16.040 --> 02:56:23.400]  and they got pissed and they said, our government's been partially taken over.
[02:56:25.080 --> 02:56:29.720]  We've got to create shadow networks to counter their shadow networks and the shadow networks
[02:56:29.720 --> 02:56:32.840]  against the globalists have never been as strong. They've never been financed,
[02:56:33.400 --> 02:56:38.120]  but they're competent people who understood what's happening and got the word out.
[02:56:38.120 --> 02:56:51.240]  And so here we are 70 years later, 70 years later. And all over the world, people know
[02:56:51.240 --> 02:56:55.320]  about the corporate new world order. They know about the plan to destroy the family.
[02:56:55.320 --> 02:56:59.480]  And now the globalist admit in the Wall Street Journal, the financial times today,
[02:57:00.040 --> 02:57:04.200]  that their world government is gone. They stole their wealth, they've got their power,
[02:57:04.200 --> 02:57:08.440]  but they're playing to really screw everybody and really keep pressing and really
[02:57:08.440 --> 02:57:14.680]  dictate our surrender. It's all falling apart in their hands. And now they're all laying low
[02:57:15.880 --> 02:57:22.920]  on Kauai, Hawaii, and they're laying low out there in Tasmania, Australia, and they're laying low
[02:57:22.920 --> 02:57:34.280]  in the Cook Islands. They're laying low in Lichtenstein. They're laying low in all those other places.
[02:57:34.280 --> 02:57:38.040]  They're not going to get their world government. And when they're done, we're not going to have
[02:57:38.040 --> 02:57:42.760]  some fake Nazi roundup thing like that at the World War II. We're going to dig you all out of your holes.
[02:57:45.160 --> 02:57:49.720]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[02:57:49.720 --> 02:57:55.640]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media that can call the fact
[02:57:55.640 --> 02:58:01.320]  that the emperor has no close, that can call BS, it's game over. But if you look at everybody
[02:58:01.320 --> 02:58:05.880]  else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all
[02:58:05.880 --> 02:58:12.200]  beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted. There's only two groups in the U.S.
[02:58:12.200 --> 02:58:17.880]  Infowars and Matt Drudge of drudgereport.com that are truly independent. And of course,
[02:58:17.880 --> 02:58:23.000]  there are two of the dominant media forces in the world. It really is amazing. That's why as we
[02:58:23.000 --> 02:58:27.720]  close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far

[03:00:13.720 --> 03:00:43.560]  Hey, doing Alex. I just want to start out by saying,
[03:00:43.560 --> 03:00:49.800]  I really admire what you do and keep you guys in our prayers all the time.
[03:00:50.760 --> 03:00:54.680]  By the way, I don't just thank you for that. I beg you for that. The prayers are the only reason
[03:00:54.680 --> 03:01:01.400]  we're here, sir. Well, you don't have to beg me for anything. Narrow is the way I just want to
[03:01:01.400 --> 03:01:08.120]  remind everybody, and this truly is a spiritual battle. I run a group called the U.S. Yellow
[03:01:08.120 --> 03:01:18.200]  Jackets. Lots of 3% has merged with some patriots. Everybody's called a truce. Unfortunately,
[03:01:19.400 --> 03:01:25.800]  I know evil all too well. God saved me. I was shot 13 times, saving a woman and her two children.
[03:01:27.960 --> 03:01:37.080]  And now, I'm on to some other things. Vegas got me really into this and got a lot of friends that
[03:01:37.080 --> 03:01:44.120]  were in Vegas. And I just have a total realization, feel a total evil in the world.
[03:01:48.360 --> 03:01:52.680]  Well, you're right. And we know Vegas was an Islamic terror attack
[03:01:52.680 --> 03:01:56.760]  meant to embarrass Trump part of the Saudi civil war. And I was told that
[03:01:57.800 --> 03:02:00.680]  by the FBI hostage rescue team, it turned out to be completely accurate.
[03:02:01.320 --> 03:02:03.560]  Then all hell broke loose once I got that information.
[03:02:03.560 --> 03:02:09.240]  And then I know that off record, now on record, I got investigated because of it.
[03:02:09.240 --> 03:02:14.200]  For Vegas, I think, actually, an FBI investigation because they wanted to know how I knew all that
[03:02:14.200 --> 03:02:21.880]  while I was told by the FBI that morning. But, yeah, now they've had senior police go public
[03:02:21.880 --> 03:02:28.280]  and say there were multiple shooters. Well, of course there were. And that was a threat to Trump
[03:02:28.280 --> 03:02:32.120]  that if he didn't roll over, they were going to keep pulling that crap. But the good news is,
[03:02:32.120 --> 03:02:34.840]  as Trump has now basically rolled all those groups up. What do you think?
[03:02:36.760 --> 03:02:44.680]  Definitely think that they're brazen. They're standing right out there and hey, I'm evil.
[03:02:44.680 --> 03:02:49.080]  I worship Satan. Hey, look at me. I'm attacking your children. What are you going to do about it?
[03:02:49.080 --> 03:02:53.960]  Well, I can tell you that I lead a group of people that have about had enough just
[03:02:54.680 --> 03:02:58.440]  good Christian people that realize that the Bible had warriors too.
[03:02:58.440 --> 03:03:04.360]  Well, exactly. And all I'm going to tell you is I'm a defensive guy. I'm a counterpuncher
[03:03:04.360 --> 03:03:07.960]  like Trump is, but they're already punching his pretty hard. So I'm not calling for anything.
[03:03:08.680 --> 03:03:13.400]  But I know for a fact that real antifa around the country that's attacked women and children
[03:03:14.760 --> 03:03:19.720]  have been falling down and hitting their heads a lot. And that's why you don't see so many
[03:03:19.720 --> 03:03:23.640]  amount except in a few cities. That's why you saw a lot of the censorship come out.
[03:03:23.640 --> 03:03:28.760]  I guess anybody exposing antifa was the establishment flipping out that let's just say it.
[03:03:28.760 --> 03:03:38.600]  Trump's wiped out MS-13 that works for Democrats. And I just, I just heard that antifa has been,
[03:03:39.480 --> 03:03:42.760]  you know, you want to go out the public and aim guns at people and stop their free speech? Well,
[03:03:43.640 --> 03:03:48.040]  men are going to show up when you don't expect it and you're going to fall down and hit your head.
[03:03:48.760 --> 03:03:51.400]  And so that's why you don't see so many of these guys on the street anymore, do you?
[03:03:51.400 --> 03:03:58.440]  Um, you know, I, I know that they're out and about. It seems like they like to catch people
[03:03:58.440 --> 03:04:03.720]  off guard. You know, they're never just say, I'm going to be here. Um, what? Oh, but you know,
[03:04:03.720 --> 03:04:06.760]  that's what I said, Caleb. They're getting caught off guard. It's very sad.
[03:04:08.600 --> 03:04:14.040]  So it is. It's very sad. You know, there might be somebody, somebody out me running counter
[03:04:14.040 --> 03:04:17.720]  intelligence against all this stuff. You never know. No, I get it, brother. They're getting
[03:04:17.720 --> 03:04:23.000]  their asses handed to them everywhere. So that's the best type of war is a cold and silent one
[03:04:23.000 --> 03:04:27.400]  that runs silent and runs deep. God bless you. I appreciate your call. All right. One more segment
[03:04:27.400 --> 03:04:33.000]  that Mike Adams takes over. So I'm going to go bam, bam, bam to Craig and D Ray and Janice and
[03:04:33.000 --> 03:04:38.600]  Lee and James and Parker and Eric straight ahead info wars.com news wars.com. But listen,
[03:04:38.600 --> 03:04:43.720]  you don't want to deal with it. You want to infiltrate democratic congressmen and
[03:04:43.720 --> 03:04:49.080]  get them committed crimes. We need good looking women to just do it.
[03:04:53.880 --> 03:05:00.760]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember this life is a test and those of you that have
[03:05:00.760 --> 03:05:05.080]  been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and
[03:05:05.080 --> 03:05:09.880]  Christianity coming back from the dead and recognizing it's being persecuted. That's all
[03:05:09.880 --> 03:05:15.000]  because you are the core listening info wars around the world. The eyes and ears of Liberty
[03:05:15.960 --> 03:05:22.600]  that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming. Everybody knows
[03:05:23.400 --> 03:05:28.680]  who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians who tend to be immune to the globalist
[03:05:28.680 --> 03:05:34.040]  brainwashing and who tend to see it. And that's why they're trying to eradicate you. But regardless,
[03:05:34.040 --> 03:05:41.720]  this fight is intensifying. 2018 has been insane. 2019 is going to be the big decision maker and
[03:05:41.720 --> 03:05:47.080]  I am so honored to be here with you right beside me. Not behind us, but right beside us and at the
[03:05:47.080 --> 03:05:51.320]  heart of everything, resisting these globalists. So whatever you do, take action and realize
[03:05:51.320 --> 03:06:06.120]  we're changing history together and I salute you.
[03:06:06.120 --> 03:06:22.920]  Resistance to tyrants is obedience to God. It's Alex Jones.
[03:06:29.400 --> 03:06:32.360]  Have you just joined us? You know, a lot of folks are talking about
[03:06:32.360 --> 03:06:41.960]  covert action against the left. And you don't even need covert action. In fact,
[03:06:41.960 --> 03:06:44.760]  next segment I'll cohost with Mike Adams because I have these clips I want to play.
[03:06:45.560 --> 03:06:49.960]  They have little kids, eight, nine, 10, 11 years old, being sent into
[03:06:53.080 --> 03:06:58.120]  strip bars and dancing in front of men who throw money at them. That's illegal.
[03:06:58.120 --> 03:07:03.160]  But these jurisdictions are so evil that they're getting away with it. Well,
[03:07:03.160 --> 03:07:07.640]  then you file federal stuff on them. You know, we don't need to do a bunch of covert
[03:07:09.080 --> 03:07:14.040]  stuff that gets you locked up in prison. But you look at Project Veritas,
[03:07:15.320 --> 03:07:20.760]  all they do send out good-looking women to intern at these places and Democrats are
[03:07:20.760 --> 03:07:25.320]  such criminals. Anything they say is illegal. And I've talked to folks behind the scenes
[03:07:25.320 --> 03:07:33.480]  they're involved. We've done some stuff ourselves. Democrats play satanic music
[03:07:33.480 --> 03:07:37.400]  on Christmas on NPR in Austin. They're into being bad.
[03:07:39.800 --> 03:07:44.280]  Their mind is turned over to it. Let me explain something. It's like shooting fish in a barrel.
[03:07:45.800 --> 03:07:49.400]  And I'm not asking women to go be sex operatives and I'm not going to run them. I'm not running
[03:07:49.400 --> 03:07:53.240]  an intelligence agency. The best type of system is where it's leaderless. But maybe I should put
[03:07:53.240 --> 03:07:59.000]  out a video explaining how to do this. I've sent Democrats to prison. I've done all sorts of stuff
[03:07:59.000 --> 03:08:03.160]  by myself, just going into a meeting and bluffing them and saying, I've got recordings of you
[03:08:03.160 --> 03:08:07.240]  admitting you stole the $300,000. And they go, he did it. He did it. And the guy's in jail
[03:08:07.960 --> 03:08:14.600]  a week later and spent five years in Brownsville, East Texas.
[03:08:19.080 --> 03:08:23.000]  All Project Veritas does is walk into Akron and say, we're running child sex life. They go, damn
[03:08:23.000 --> 03:08:26.920]  right, that's our business. We'll help you run the slaves. Here's how you fill out the paperwork.
[03:08:30.120 --> 03:08:35.560]  They're so evil that, but they think they're untouchable because they always run in their own
[03:08:35.560 --> 03:08:41.480]  little cities where they control the police department. But even in those cities, most of
[03:08:41.480 --> 03:08:45.640]  police are disgusted and will leak you information. I'll never forget they were taking this veterans
[03:08:45.640 --> 03:08:50.920]  house in the nice area of Austin. It was gentrifying for three inch grass, Roland Ellingston. The
[03:08:50.920 --> 03:08:56.280]  story went viral, went nationwide. They were giving him $2,000 a day fines. The cops were so pissed
[03:08:57.400 --> 03:09:01.720]  they were ordered by Democrats to go arrest him and stuff for not paying the fines that they said,
[03:09:01.720 --> 03:09:06.200]  Mr. Jones, I had a comment line and this guy goes, yeah, I'm a sergeant of the police department.
[03:09:06.200 --> 03:09:09.480]  But you don't use my name, but just here's who I am, blah, blah. Here's my number, you need
[03:09:09.480 --> 03:09:15.560]  any information. He said, the city council woman involved in all this has a couple different houses,
[03:09:15.560 --> 03:09:20.120]  rent houses, but a bunch of them are overgrown, have tarps on the roof and they're violating code.
[03:09:20.120 --> 03:09:23.160]  So here's their house. I bought their house. Guess what? They dropped the charges against
[03:09:23.160 --> 03:09:32.120]  that old guy that day and it's little stuff like that. And so it's time to take the gloves off,
[03:09:32.120 --> 03:09:43.400]  ladies and gentlemen. I mean, I'm not going to tell women what to do, but if you're a sexy woman
[03:09:43.400 --> 03:09:49.320]  and you live in a Democrat city, I guarantee you, or maybe you're a man, a lot of these guys are gay,
[03:09:49.320 --> 03:09:53.480]  you could, I'm not saying do this, but you could get them to take, you just meet them like, you
[03:09:53.480 --> 03:10:00.040]  know, find out where they go, go to the bank, find out where they go to the shopping mall,
[03:10:00.040 --> 03:10:05.400]  find out where they go to a bar, pick them up, record them bragging about all their criminal
[03:10:05.400 --> 03:10:11.000]  activity. And while they're taking a shower, getting ready to have sex with you in that hotel room,
[03:10:11.000 --> 03:10:21.240]  you just leave and you dump it all on the internet. I mean, the Democrats are child molesters. Most
[03:10:21.240 --> 03:10:27.960]  of them know of that. So, I mean, I don't want to have a shooting war revolution. The easiest way is
[03:10:27.960 --> 03:10:36.120]  to run operations against them and anybody can research how you do this. And let me tell you
[03:10:36.120 --> 03:10:41.960]  something. I stumbled my way into Bohemian Grove and blew it wide open. I stumbled my way in and
[03:10:41.960 --> 03:10:47.560]  exposed all the pedophile operations. I stumbled my way in and exposed when they were doing gun
[03:10:47.560 --> 03:10:53.240]  confiscation drills under Bill Clinton. I'm not even that smart or good. I just did it. And sure,
[03:10:53.240 --> 03:10:57.960]  you can get in trouble doing it. You can get killed doing it, but you're going to get killed anyways
[03:10:57.960 --> 03:11:03.160]  by these people. Why don't you do it on your own time? Don't get tricked by some leftist controlled
[03:11:03.160 --> 03:11:09.240]  thing like QAnon and try to block the highway at the Hugh Hoover Dam. That's, that's, that's, that
[03:11:09.240 --> 03:11:22.040]  don't do things that are illegal. Do what Veritas does. Do what Veritas does. You know, send the
[03:11:22.040 --> 03:11:27.560]  recording of the mayor trying to have sex with you and bragging about all the stuff he's involved
[03:11:27.560 --> 03:11:35.000]  in. Send it to his wife. And you're like, well, how do I do that? We'll just go find out where,
[03:11:35.000 --> 03:11:38.760]  what his wife does and what boards she's on and what she's doing and send it to her. See,
[03:11:39.480 --> 03:11:44.520]  there's more ways to hurt these people than you can imagine. And it's time to start hurting them.
[03:11:44.520 --> 03:11:47.480]  And here's the thing, because they're getting ready to kill the president and shut the internet
[03:11:47.480 --> 03:11:53.560]  down. Right now, I'm going to start on air telling you things you can do once we go dark.
[03:11:53.560 --> 03:11:58.280]  If we go to that point, we're going to start, this is just a small lesson, just a little,
[03:11:58.280 --> 03:12:03.720]  little dibblin. If they make us go dark, what do you start doing?
[03:12:06.600 --> 03:12:10.520]  And then there's other stories. They start killing people and rounding people up. Well,
[03:12:11.320 --> 03:12:14.920]  then it's not offensive. It's defensive. And then
[03:12:14.920 --> 03:12:27.880]  then you obviously know who's who in your area. See, the globalists are smart. They
[03:12:27.880 --> 03:12:31.800]  hype up revolution is shooting cops, pumping gas in the back of the head. No, if there's
[03:12:31.800 --> 03:12:37.240]  a violent revolution in America, you don't kill the police. Even if they're leftist, you just go
[03:12:37.240 --> 03:12:48.680]  around them because they can replace police all day long. They can't replace kingpins and capos.
[03:12:52.600 --> 03:12:58.680]  And these people are cowards. So I don't want anybody to offensively do anything.
[03:12:58.680 --> 03:13:05.160]  But if they think they're going to start killing people,
[03:13:07.480 --> 03:13:09.080]  I mean, you don't think I'm the,
[03:13:12.440 --> 03:13:17.400]  listen, a lot of people think this is a setup to like get the left to pull something. It's
[03:13:17.400 --> 03:13:20.760]  actually not. This is just satanic. These people are crazy. But
[03:13:20.760 --> 03:13:29.400]  the globalists will dissolve in a shooting war in minutes. These are bullies that want to rape
[03:13:29.400 --> 03:13:33.240]  kids and abort babies because spiritually that's what they think they could muster up to an
[03:13:33.240 --> 03:13:38.040]  unborn baby. They're such cowards. They want to kill an unborn baby. Man, when the fish start
[03:13:38.040 --> 03:13:42.840]  flying and the bullets start zipping around, these people do one thing and that's get another set
[03:13:42.840 --> 03:13:51.960]  of diapers. Those of us that love God, it's like breathing air. In fact, it's a lot of fun.
[03:14:01.160 --> 03:14:03.480]  Craig in Canada, thanks for holding your own here. Go ahead.
[03:14:04.760 --> 03:14:10.200]  There's perhaps an association Peter Schiff should be accountable for. In 2017, Peter Schiff's
[03:14:10.200 --> 03:14:14.440]  company Schiff Gold launched a joint venture with a company called Gold Money and Gold Money had a
[03:14:14.440 --> 03:14:18.920]  good reputation with the founder, James Turk, and got a good endorsement from G. Edward Griffith
[03:14:18.920 --> 03:14:27.000]  in 2011. But 2014, a company called Big Gold was founded with Alexander Soros, Soros Brothers
[03:14:27.000 --> 03:14:33.800]  Investment Money, bought up Gold Money in 2015. Big Gold then switched their parent company
[03:14:33.800 --> 03:14:39.320]  named to Gold Money for the goodwill. So in effect, Schiff company that has merged with
[03:14:39.320 --> 03:14:46.360]  a Soros company in 2015, he's on Joe Rogan a lot pumping a lot of money into Bit Gold.
[03:14:46.360 --> 03:14:53.480]  Who is? Who is? Peter Schiff. Well, I didn't screen your call, but I have Peter Schiff on
[03:14:53.480 --> 03:14:59.400]  as a guest and... No, I know. I mean... Well, no, but I'd like to look into that. I'm not really
[03:14:59.400 --> 03:15:05.480]  familiar. I saw him put some article on while you were talking. But I mean, Soros is bought into
[03:15:05.480 --> 03:15:11.160]  everything. I'm not trying to defend Schiff. I don't know about this yet. But I mean, are you
[03:15:11.160 --> 03:15:18.360]  saying he sold his company to Soros? He merged joint venture with Bit Gold, which Soros back.
[03:15:18.360 --> 03:15:22.600]  It's just a Wikipedia. He's called Wikipedia and figured out. Well, next time he's on, I'll bring
[03:15:22.600 --> 03:15:27.400]  that up to him. I appreciate it because, you know, he's bought Harvard. I know he ran for Senate.
[03:15:27.400 --> 03:15:36.360]  He talked to you, ignored him when he ran for Senate in 2008. But I'm sure he's a great guy,
[03:15:36.360 --> 03:15:38.920]  but he's probably trying to cover his own butt now. I have no idea.
[03:15:39.960 --> 03:15:43.080]  Yeah, well, I'll ask him about it next time it comes up. I mean, Soros just got his fingers and
[03:15:43.080 --> 03:15:47.000]  everything. You know, that's kind of like... We used to be syndicated by ABC. That's just a
[03:15:47.000 --> 03:15:52.360]  satellite you rented. I wasn't with ABC. They had a satellite. ABC did. People thought I worked for ABC.

[03:17:53.960 --> 03:18:00.840]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember this life is a test. And those of you that have
[03:18:00.840 --> 03:18:05.160]  been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and
[03:18:05.160 --> 03:18:09.960]  Christianity coming back from the dead and recognizing it's being persecuted, that's all
[03:18:09.960 --> 03:18:15.080]  because you are the core. Listening to info wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty
[03:18:16.040 --> 03:18:22.680]  that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming. Everybody knows
[03:18:23.480 --> 03:18:28.760]  who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians who tend to be immune to the globalist
[03:18:28.760 --> 03:18:34.120]  brainwashing and who tend to see it. And that's why they're trying to eradicate you. But regardless,
[03:18:34.120 --> 03:18:41.960]  this fight is intensifying. 2018 has been insane. 2019 is going to be the big decision maker and I
[03:18:41.960 --> 03:18:47.080]  am so honored to be here with you right beside me. Not behind us, but right beside us and at the
[03:18:47.080 --> 03:18:51.320]  heart of everything, resisting these globalists. So whatever you do, take action and realize
[03:18:51.320 --> 03:18:56.760]  we're changing history together and I salute you. The globalists are trying to set up a private
[03:18:56.760 --> 03:19:02.200]  corporate world government that's above the law. If there's any opposition, if there's any independent
[03:19:02.200 --> 03:19:08.440]  media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes that can call BS, it's game over.
[03:19:09.480 --> 03:19:13.960]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[03:19:13.960 --> 03:19:17.800]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[03:19:18.600 --> 03:19:25.400]  There's only two groups in the U.S. Info Wars and Matt Rudge of rudgereport.com that are truly
[03:19:25.400 --> 03:19:30.200]  independent. And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world. It really is
[03:19:30.200 --> 03:19:35.880]  amazing. That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight
[03:19:35.880 --> 03:19:39.720]  we're all in and how far we've come together. Just remind you that you are the power, you're the
[03:19:39.720 --> 03:19:46.840]  strength, you're the will of Info Wars. So please spread the links, infowars.com, newswars.com,
[03:19:46.840 --> 03:19:50.760]  prisonpudda.com, because if you don't spread the articles, the videos, no one else will.
[03:19:51.320 --> 03:19:53.880]  We're all in each other's hands. God bless you all and thank you.
[03:19:53.880 --> 03:19:59.800]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:20:24.280 --> 03:20:29.000]  And then of course I'm running into his time, naturalnews.com. He did a great job last week,
[03:20:29.000 --> 03:20:33.320]  that amazing breakdown of the depopulation plan. The New York Times has announced everything we've
[03:20:33.320 --> 03:20:38.280]  talked about is now being mainstream. But I promise to get to all the calls and that's the problem.
[03:20:38.280 --> 03:20:42.280]  We may have to start limiting the phone system like 10 lines. We have like 20 something lines,
[03:20:42.280 --> 03:20:46.520]  they fill up, and then I promise to get to all your calls. It becomes an unwinnable game,
[03:20:46.520 --> 03:20:50.760]  unless I spend 30 seconds with each one. But since one of the callers brings this up,
[03:20:50.760 --> 03:20:55.000]  we'll go to Mike Adams, David Knight. Parker and Georgia brings up David Knight. David had
[03:20:55.000 --> 03:21:00.920]  multiple heart surgeries this morning, procedures. They're doing so well, they're going to send him
[03:21:00.920 --> 03:21:06.440]  home tomorrow. So praise God for that. Really good news. And Mike is usually hard to get to
[03:21:06.440 --> 03:21:11.720]  even host my shows, even volunteer to host some for David, weekday mornings, 8am. So Parker,
[03:21:11.720 --> 03:21:17.320]  what's your take on David Knight? Go ahead. Oh man, the best. Hi Alex, nice to meet you.
[03:21:17.320 --> 03:21:25.400]  Nice to meet you. I have watched your show for about three years now. I got turned on on YouTube
[03:21:26.040 --> 03:21:32.520]  and I watch you every chance I get along with Hannity Carlson Ingram. So you're right up my
[03:21:32.520 --> 03:21:40.680]  alley. Well, thank you, sir. David Knight is a class act. And I don't always have a chance to
[03:21:40.680 --> 03:21:46.680]  catch up with you every day. But when I heard this man had a massive heart attack, I'm like,
[03:21:46.680 --> 03:21:54.360]  oh no, not this one. So my thoughts and my prayers are with him. A couple of other things. I want to
[03:21:54.360 --> 03:22:01.000]  touch, I wanted to talk to you for a long time and I've hesitated. So again, thank you for taking
[03:22:01.000 --> 03:22:08.120]  my call. Oh sir, we appreciate you holding my goodness. No, not a problem. Owen Schreuer, great guy,
[03:22:09.000 --> 03:22:15.640]  lot of fortitude there. So if I could just, you know, look back on 2018 with you and some of your
[03:22:15.640 --> 03:22:23.240]  great stories of the year. Love the young man's portitude in front of the Austin City Council
[03:22:23.800 --> 03:22:30.040]  and taking the task, those pieces of shit on the council with regard to Planned Parenthood.
[03:22:30.600 --> 03:22:37.320]  Now you're right. Owen in front of city council in three minutes does does that 100% a plus.
[03:22:37.320 --> 03:22:42.680]  He knocks out of the park a powerful Jedi. He's already become and he's going to do so much more.
[03:22:42.680 --> 03:22:47.880]  So yes, I'm very rejoiceful for not just the informers, but people like Mike Adams and all the
[03:22:47.880 --> 03:22:52.520]  guests we have. You know, this is such a brain trust of really good people and our listeners
[03:22:52.520 --> 03:22:56.680]  who are the blood of the operation. I don't just say that like patting on the head.
[03:22:56.680 --> 03:23:03.000]  What you stood against and what you've done has, has, has absolutely changed all the, you know,
[03:23:03.000 --> 03:23:07.240]  tables around because you got drugs, you got info wars, you've got natural news and the 300 sites
[03:23:07.240 --> 03:23:12.200]  that Mike Adams has, he's probably as big as info wars together. But he had to do that because
[03:23:12.200 --> 03:23:17.880]  of censorship. He's been censored like we have. There's not many independent groups out there.
[03:23:18.600 --> 03:23:23.320]  Everybody else is like Mike Savage. You can be taken down because he's number one. You're like,
[03:23:23.320 --> 03:23:27.800]  well, I thought you stay on your number one. No, he's being taken off. So God bless you Parker.
[03:23:27.800 --> 03:23:31.240]  And yeah, we're going to give David as much time as he needs to convalesce
[03:23:32.040 --> 03:23:37.000]  and get himself together. I have a feeling he'd been going a while with it fully blocked
[03:23:37.000 --> 03:23:43.880]  because he'd lost a lot of weight. He was really very white, very, very, very upset. You know,
[03:23:43.880 --> 03:23:49.560]  he was very sad the last few months. And we now know he had a blocked part of his heart was blocked.
[03:23:49.560 --> 03:23:53.320]  So a lot of times after surgery, people get better. So we were all excited about that.
[03:23:53.320 --> 03:23:57.080]  Mike Adams, thanks for co-hosting today. And sorry, I ran over getting these calls, but
[03:23:57.800 --> 03:24:01.000]  obviously we'll talk about Mike Adams, but also just the state of the world, what you see,
[03:24:01.000 --> 03:24:06.280]  Conan Plain, I think the consensus says Trump is showing signs he's going on the offense. We need
[03:24:06.280 --> 03:24:13.880]  total offense because the left is on the offense. We are watching the unfolding of massive human
[03:24:13.880 --> 03:24:19.000]  awakening. And of course, Alex, you and Infowars, all of us have been a big part of that. And you
[03:24:19.000 --> 03:24:24.680]  know, you had you had callers before talking about needing to be more positive. Obviously,
[03:24:24.680 --> 03:24:29.000]  it is important to give action items and to give solutions. But I need to remind people,
[03:24:29.000 --> 03:24:34.920]  this awakening wouldn't be happening unless people like you, Alex, were exposing the evil
[03:24:34.920 --> 03:24:40.440]  of our world. So covering the negative is an absolutely essential, an essential ingredient
[03:24:40.440 --> 03:24:45.080]  to the mass awakening that's taking place right now. We cannot forget that. If you just run around
[03:24:45.080 --> 03:24:49.720]  being positive all the time, then we never expose the evil. I mean, that's what the Democrats say.
[03:24:49.720 --> 03:24:53.640]  You have to be positive all the time. If you're critical of anything, then that's hate speech.
[03:24:53.640 --> 03:24:58.120]  And then they ban you. Well, that doesn't make any sense. We have to tell both sides of what's
[03:24:58.120 --> 03:25:01.880]  happening. We have to tell the truth. We have to expose the evil that's happening in the world.
[03:25:01.880 --> 03:25:07.000]  So that's that's some of what I'm going to cover in the upcoming segments. Alex, did you want me
[03:25:07.000 --> 03:25:12.120]  to just go into that right now? I wanted to get your take to on just how precious few because we
[03:25:12.120 --> 03:25:18.040]  don't want to be the main like others. David Knight and there's few other people like you and
[03:25:18.040 --> 03:25:22.360]  folks. We need more people to be leaders because they're coming after everybody. The fact that
[03:25:22.360 --> 03:25:26.200]  they're taking Michael Savage off the air, the fact that they're getting no fanfare because
[03:25:26.200 --> 03:25:29.960]  of his contract. He can't talk about it. They're doing all this ahead of a big event, which is
[03:25:29.960 --> 03:25:35.320]  removing Trump. Well, you're absolutely right. And I know that you have called for this. I have
[03:25:35.320 --> 03:25:41.320]  as well. We want thousands of people to launch their own platforms to be their own broadcasters.
[03:25:43.640 --> 03:25:48.040]  Well, exactly. I mean, everywhere we want massive decentralization. That's really what we want
[03:25:48.040 --> 03:25:53.640]  because that's how we win. It's the centralized control and corruption that destroys the ability
[03:25:53.640 --> 03:25:59.000]  of people to act independently and to think for themselves. So I know even you, Alex, you don't
[03:25:59.000 --> 03:26:04.040]  want everything to go through info wars. You want info wars to just be an example, an example of
[03:26:04.040 --> 03:26:09.000]  liberty and freedom so that other people can be inspired to do their own version of liberty and
[03:26:09.000 --> 03:26:14.040]  freedom. And that's what this is really about. It's no longer, it's not even about ego. It's
[03:26:14.040 --> 03:26:19.880]  just about fighting for humanity. We are on team humanity. And I feel the same way. I'm here today
[03:26:19.880 --> 03:26:24.120]  because I'm fighting for team humanity. I do what I do every day because I'm fighting for team
[03:26:24.120 --> 03:26:29.720]  humanity. You know, we're so far past this being a job or a career. This is about survival of the
[03:26:29.720 --> 03:26:34.040]  human race at this point. That's what we're fighting for every day. And we invite everyone who wants
[03:26:34.040 --> 03:26:38.760]  to be on that team. And you don't have to be huge. You don't have to, you don't have to have a big
[03:26:38.760 --> 03:26:43.720]  multimillion dollar operation. You can just tweet out the right hashtags. You can have so many
[03:26:43.720 --> 03:26:47.960]  people with a Twitter or Facebook on their own website. They'll have little things, big things,
[03:26:47.960 --> 03:26:52.280]  moderate things, but they're there when the big event happens. And then they change the world,
[03:26:52.280 --> 03:26:57.480]  just existing as an early warning system and being here. I told the crew, I said,
[03:26:57.480 --> 03:27:01.800]  our core audience is bigger than ever. They've cut off a lot of our big reach, but it doesn't
[03:27:01.800 --> 03:27:06.120]  matter because our listeners are the early warning system. Now we just have to hold on
[03:27:06.760 --> 03:27:12.680]  as the broadcasting system for early warning and Intel and critical truthful narratives
[03:27:12.680 --> 03:27:18.680]  into the future. That's our real job. Exactly right. And along with that is this mass
[03:27:18.680 --> 03:27:25.240]  decentralization. I think 2019 is the year of accelerating decentralization because the
[03:27:25.240 --> 03:27:30.600]  governments are in essence losing trust. The people don't trust governments anymore. The people
[03:27:30.600 --> 03:27:34.840]  don't trust the centralized media. The people don't trust the EU anymore. And that's why they've
[03:27:34.840 --> 03:27:38.920]  done this desperate thing to censor. This isn't a sign of strength. It's a sign of weakness. And
[03:27:38.920 --> 03:27:42.840]  people that sit on the sidelines like Joe Rogan, they're just missing out on history and I feel
[03:27:42.840 --> 03:27:46.040]  sorry for them. But the crew keeps putting this on screen. They've wanted me to cover it since
[03:27:46.040 --> 03:27:52.200]  last week. Dozens of prominent conservative and Democrat Twitter sites have either been locked
[03:27:52.200 --> 03:27:56.840]  down or removed their tweets like the former president George Herbert Walker Bush, George W.
[03:27:56.840 --> 03:28:01.720]  Bush. Why do you think they're all making their, I mean, it's pure speculation. Why do you think
[03:28:01.720 --> 03:28:06.520]  they're having all their Twitter accounts go dark? Well, it's clear that this is going to accelerate
[03:28:06.520 --> 03:28:12.440]  until something dramatic changes. Apple just told us last night that they're going to ban
[03:28:12.440 --> 03:28:17.400]  the natural news app, by the way. So we're being censored off of Apple. I've been censored off
[03:28:17.400 --> 03:28:24.120]  YouTube for almost a year now. This is accelerating because they plan to unleash big action. I'll just
[03:28:24.120 --> 03:28:29.480]  put it that way. Major action against Trump and for the 2020 election. And you notice that Warren
[03:28:29.480 --> 03:28:34.040]  of course just announced that she's running for president. That was a strategy after she announced
[03:28:34.040 --> 03:28:38.760]  that she's no longer going to claim to be a woman of color. So they're cleaning up her history so
[03:28:38.760 --> 03:28:42.600]  she could try to run for president. By the way, let me just throw this in briefly. One of the biggest
[03:28:42.600 --> 03:28:48.040]  Christian leaders in the world, 50 million subscribers, Franklin Graham got banned on Facebook
[03:28:48.040 --> 03:28:51.240]  and then they backed off and they're going to get everybody fucked. This is the big move.
[03:28:53.080 --> 03:28:58.840]  Pain in my neck, back and shoulders has really gotten worse. Relief for body pain is here with
[03:28:58.840 --> 03:29:02.920]  Sunny Bay heating pads. Well, the last thing I want is to take another pill. So what's so good

[03:30:50.840 --> 03:30:56.440]  storeable foods powered by my patriot supply. The globalists are trying to set up a private
[03:30:56.440 --> 03:31:01.800]  corporate world government that's above the law. If there's any opposition, if there's any independent
[03:31:01.800 --> 03:31:08.040]  media that can call the fact that the emperor has no clothes, that can call BS, it's game over.
[03:31:09.080 --> 03:31:13.560]  But if you look at everybody else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson
[03:31:13.560 --> 03:31:17.400]  and Sean Hannity, they are all beholden to the networks they're on that can be targeted.
[03:31:17.400 --> 03:31:23.560]  There's only two groups in the U.S., Info Wars and Matt Drudge of Drudge Report.com
[03:31:24.280 --> 03:31:28.680]  that are truly independent. And of course, they're two of the dominant media forces in the world.
[03:31:29.400 --> 03:31:34.680]  It really is amazing. That's why as we close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners
[03:31:34.680 --> 03:31:38.520]  of the amazing fight we're all in and how far we've come together. Just remind you that you are
[03:31:38.520 --> 03:31:44.280]  the power, you're the strength, you're the will of Info Wars. So please spread the links,
[03:31:44.280 --> 03:31:49.000]  infowars.com, newswars.com, christenpana.com, because if you don't spread the articles and
[03:31:49.000 --> 03:31:53.800]  videos, no one else will. We're all in each other's hands. God bless you all and thank you.
[03:31:53.800 --> 03:31:58.200]  The globalists know that if they suppress the good halogen and pump the environment full of
[03:31:58.200 --> 03:32:03.640]  the bad halogens, fluoride, chlorine, bromide, you name it, that it lowers IQ, it literally
[03:32:04.200 --> 03:32:08.840]  dumbs the population down. And on our quest to bring our listeners and viewers the best
[03:32:08.840 --> 03:32:14.920]  iodine in the world, we've gone through two permutations. First, seaweed-based iodine that was
[03:32:14.920 --> 03:32:18.920]  pretty good but hard to source, and the globalists tried to block us getting a supply of it.
[03:32:18.920 --> 03:32:24.680]  So we discovered deep earth crystals of pure nascent iodine and brought UX2 that's been incredible.
[03:32:25.240 --> 03:32:30.440]  Now, due to the establishment trying to block that, we did more research and secured more of the
[03:32:30.440 --> 03:32:35.880]  deep earth crystals of nascent iodine. But chemists, scientists, and others showed us the research
[03:32:35.880 --> 03:32:42.360]  that by combining it with three other compounds, two forms of iodine and vitamin C, it supercharges
[03:32:42.360 --> 03:32:48.120]  it and makes it even more bioavailable. Ladies and gentlemen, you want to research it,
[03:32:48.120 --> 03:32:53.400]  you want to see it, it's an incredible discovery. X3, now available at m4slife.com.
[03:32:53.400 --> 03:33:03.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:10.600 --> 03:33:17.160]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[03:33:17.160 --> 03:33:22.440]  It's Mike Adams. You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[03:33:25.720 --> 03:33:29.960]  This is Mike Adams filling in for the rest of the hour here on the Alex Jones show. Thank you
[03:33:29.960 --> 03:33:35.160]  for joining me. This has been a very interesting show already I've been listening. And a lot of
[03:33:35.160 --> 03:33:42.120]  talk about positivity for 2019 and beyond. And let me just say on the record that one of the most
[03:33:42.120 --> 03:33:48.760]  positive truths that we should all embrace right now is recognizing that humanity has a choice.
[03:33:49.400 --> 03:33:54.920]  Humanity has a choice about where we take the future of our world. Are we going to live as
[03:33:54.920 --> 03:34:00.600]  slaves under a techno tyranny, run by fake news, media organizations,
[03:34:01.640 --> 03:34:07.080]  cry bullies in the education system, language police everywhere? Are we going to submit to that?
[03:34:07.080 --> 03:34:16.440]  Or are we going to rise up with reason and passion and love for liberty and love for humanity,
[03:34:16.440 --> 03:34:22.920]  love for our children, love for our nation, love for safety and the rule of law?
[03:34:23.560 --> 03:34:28.600]  You know, that's a choice that we have as human beings right now, being that we're conscious,
[03:34:29.160 --> 03:34:34.920]  but making that choice, and this is what's critical, and this is why info wars is so important,
[03:34:34.920 --> 03:34:42.280]  making that choice requires us to be informed. And so the primary focus of the corporate controlled
[03:34:42.280 --> 03:34:50.040]  media is to control that information and also isolate you from the truth. That's their point,
[03:34:50.040 --> 03:34:55.960]  because they want you to be enslaved, obviously you know that, but they do that by isolating you
[03:34:55.960 --> 03:35:01.720]  from truthful information, which is why the censorship has to target info wars or natural
[03:35:01.720 --> 03:35:08.840]  news or, you know, Tucker Carlson, Sean Hannity, whoever. That's why, because the truth is now
[03:35:08.840 --> 03:35:13.560]  defined as hate speech. The truth is hate speech. And as another great example of that,
[03:35:14.360 --> 03:35:22.520]  Facebook is now banning the sharing of our articles to talk about the dangers of 5G networks.
[03:35:22.520 --> 03:35:28.840]  Think about that. When we talk about brain cancer being caused by exposure to 5G cell signals
[03:35:28.840 --> 03:35:35.880]  and the weaponization of the cell tower network, Facebook bans that and says it's a violation
[03:35:35.880 --> 03:35:40.680]  of their community guidelines. So wait a minute. Does that mean that if we say
[03:35:42.040 --> 03:35:46.360]  cell towers are awesome, everybody hold a phone to your head so you get cancer,
[03:35:46.360 --> 03:35:51.240]  that Facebook would say, yeah, that's good. That's okay. You can share that good information,
[03:35:51.240 --> 03:35:57.720]  good on you, mate. Is that what they would do? But when you warn people about 5G and you try to
[03:35:57.720 --> 03:36:03.640]  protect humanity and you try to help people be safe, maybe limiting their time on a 5G device or
[03:36:03.640 --> 03:36:09.720]  moving out of the city and not even being exposed to it at all, that's considered offensive. That's
[03:36:09.720 --> 03:36:16.120]  considered a violation. Same thing with vaccines. If you try to teach people, hey, why are you
[03:36:16.120 --> 03:36:21.560]  vaccinating these young infants with so many vaccines at such a young age before their immune
[03:36:21.560 --> 03:36:26.440]  system is developed? Why don't you, even if you're, if you're going to do vaccines, why don't you
[03:36:26.440 --> 03:36:33.320]  spread them out? Why don't you delay them? Why are you given a 16-month-old baby, an HPV vaccine
[03:36:33.320 --> 03:36:38.440]  that protects them against the sexually transmitted disease? Are there 16-month-old
[03:36:38.440 --> 03:36:43.800]  infants that are sexually active? God, I hope not. That vaccine makes no sense at that age.
[03:36:43.800 --> 03:36:48.040]  Why are you doing it so early? Why are you hitting that baby with so many vaccines at once? But if
[03:36:48.040 --> 03:36:54.440]  you say that, oh, you're banned because, oh, now that might be offensive to somebody. That might be
[03:36:54.440 --> 03:37:01.480]  objectionable content. Pinterest has banned all such content now that talks about the dangers of
[03:37:01.480 --> 03:37:07.320]  vaccines. If you even talk about vaccine ingredients, just the scientific facts. What's in the vaccine?
[03:37:07.320 --> 03:37:12.280]  Here are the ingredients according to the FDA and the CDC. That will get you banned on Pinterest.
[03:37:12.280 --> 03:37:19.000]  So you see, what this all has in common is making sure that people don't get good information. And
[03:37:19.000 --> 03:37:25.960]  that's why what we do here at InfoWars is so crucial. We're bringing you the information that helps
[03:37:25.960 --> 03:37:32.040]  empower humanity so that human beings can make a conscious informed choice to choose freedom.
[03:37:32.600 --> 03:37:37.400]  And that's why spreading the information about this broadcast and these videos and the articles on
[03:37:37.400 --> 03:37:42.760]  newswars.com and the videos from Paul Joseph Watson and everybody else, that's why it's so crucial.
[03:37:42.760 --> 03:37:47.400]  And that's why we are, in essence, really winning, as Alex said earlier in the show today,
[03:37:47.400 --> 03:37:52.120]  we are winning the war for the minds of the free thinking citizens of the world.
[03:37:52.840 --> 03:37:58.200]  The globalist centralization effort is really starting to accelerate its collapse.
[03:37:58.840 --> 03:38:03.080]  And I'm going to make a prediction here right now about something big that I think is going to
[03:38:03.080 --> 03:38:06.680]  happen globally. I'll get to that in just a second. But first, I want to share with you
[03:38:07.640 --> 03:38:13.640]  on this issue of making a choice. I was telling a member of the crew there during the break,
[03:38:13.640 --> 03:38:20.600]  over the holidays, like what I did, I did hardcore combat training with former marines
[03:38:20.600 --> 03:38:26.760]  who are experts in combatives. And so, you know, they had me in arm bars and they were,
[03:38:26.760 --> 03:38:31.880]  we were doing weapon takeaways and it was a lot of mat work and I got beat up and I'm sore as heck
[03:38:31.880 --> 03:38:37.400]  and my elbow hurts. And I got my head bashed in a couple of times as well. It was not fun,
[03:38:37.400 --> 03:38:42.360]  but I made the choice to do that instead of just going out drinking, going out partying,
[03:38:42.360 --> 03:38:49.160]  going out and socializing. I made a choice to focus on skills that I think might be useful for
[03:38:49.160 --> 03:38:53.960]  survival, preparedness, self-defense as our world becomes more chaotic. The point is,
[03:38:53.960 --> 03:38:59.400]  you have that choice too. And your form of preparedness might be completely different
[03:38:59.400 --> 03:39:05.080]  from mine. And that's okay. But what are you doing with your day? What are you doing with every
[03:39:05.080 --> 03:39:11.960]  precious hour that you have? What are you doing with your actions right now, beyond just listening
[03:39:11.960 --> 03:39:17.960]  to this program? Which is, which is a great starting point, but what actions are you taking
[03:39:17.960 --> 03:39:22.440]  to share this information and impact your own personal life? Are you prepared? Do you have
[03:39:22.440 --> 03:39:27.320]  a bug out bag? Do you have a plan to get out of the city if you live in a city? You know,
[03:39:27.320 --> 03:39:31.800]  the last time I hosted this show, I talked about the government report that warned 99
[03:39:31.800 --> 03:39:37.320]  nuclear power plants across America could go into a meltdown. This was a government report
[03:39:37.320 --> 03:39:43.960]  because of a grid down power failure. How close are you to a nuclear power plant?
[03:39:43.960 --> 03:39:50.120]  Do you have a plan to get away on foot or bicycle if there's an EMP attack? Do you have a plan?
[03:39:50.920 --> 03:39:55.480]  Because you should take, in my opinion, you should take this time, some of this time at least,
[03:39:55.480 --> 03:39:59.160]  I mean, time with family is important and time off is important, but take some of this time
[03:40:00.040 --> 03:40:04.520]  and invest it in your future, invest it in your survival. Are you prepared? Do you have
[03:40:04.520 --> 03:40:11.000]  the skills? Do you have the fitness level to walk 20 miles in a day with a 50 pound bag on your,
[03:40:11.000 --> 03:40:15.800]  on your back? If you don't have that fitness level, get out and start walking. Just start walking.
[03:40:16.680 --> 03:40:21.480]  Just walk around the street, walk around the mall, walk around a farm field, whatever, just,
[03:40:21.480 --> 03:40:26.280]  just get out, get that fitness going because that will serve you for the rest of your life.
[03:40:26.280 --> 03:40:30.040]  And these are actions that you can take. Don't let it just be a theoretical thing in your head
[03:40:30.040 --> 03:40:34.840]  like, oh yeah, Mike Adams sounds, sounds correct. Yeah, that's a good thing. And I'm going to go
[03:40:34.840 --> 03:40:41.640]  back to playing video games. No, take action. Do what you need to do now because time is running
[03:40:41.640 --> 03:40:48.600]  short. Now, to my, to my prediction, big prediction, I believe that there is a,
[03:40:49.800 --> 03:40:55.320]  we're seeing the opening stages of the economic and environmental collapse of communist China.
[03:40:55.320 --> 03:41:03.240]  I believe that communist China will collapse in the next few years. It might be two, it might be 10,
[03:41:03.960 --> 03:41:10.760]  but it has begun. And this is because the citizens of China, enough of them want to be free.
[03:41:11.320 --> 03:41:16.200]  And China, even with all of the censorship efforts, has not been able to absolutely
[03:41:16.200 --> 03:41:21.640]  control everything that its own citizens do and think and say or speak or share.
[03:41:21.640 --> 03:41:27.080]  The end of communist China, I believe is coming and much the way the end of the Soviet Union
[03:41:27.080 --> 03:41:34.200]  happened. It will be all of a sudden overnight. It will be like Tiananmen Square, but it will
[03:41:34.200 --> 03:41:40.600]  succeed. It might be the students as what happened in 1989, or it might be another demographic in
[03:41:40.600 --> 03:41:45.800]  that society. But what's going to accelerate this, believe it or not, is the globalist
[03:41:45.800 --> 03:41:51.720]  banker attack on President Trump. The globalists are trying to crash the global debt system.
[03:41:52.600 --> 03:41:58.920]  And they're going to cause the economic collapse of China as a result. So in other words,
[03:41:58.920 --> 03:42:03.640]  it's going to be collateral damage from the globalist point of view that has communist China
[03:42:03.640 --> 03:42:08.760]  suffering a massive debt collapse, also an environmental collapse, because there's so
[03:42:08.760 --> 03:42:13.640]  much mass poisoning, industrial waste going into the food supply in China, going into the
[03:42:13.640 --> 03:42:19.240]  rivers and the air and the soil and so on. They're going to suffer a simultaneous ecological
[03:42:19.240 --> 03:42:26.440]  collapse as well as a financial collapse. You won't know for sure that that's happening until
[03:42:26.440 --> 03:42:33.480]  the day that it comes, just like the former Soviet Union. It will feel like it's all of a
[03:42:33.480 --> 03:42:39.160]  sudden, but it's building to it now and it will accelerate in 2019. I'll have much more straight
[03:42:39.160 --> 03:42:43.960]  ahead. This is Mike Adams filling in for Alex Jones here on the fourth hour of the broadcast.
[03:42:43.960 --> 03:42:47.800]  Today, I've got more news and analysis for you straight ahead. So stay right where you are.
[03:42:47.800 --> 03:42:48.760]  We'll be right back.
[03:42:52.760 --> 03:42:59.240]  So as we prepare to close out 2018, just remember this life is a test. And those of you that have
[03:42:59.240 --> 03:43:03.720]  been listening and watching and taking action, the victories of populism and nationalism and
[03:43:03.720 --> 03:43:08.360]  Christianity coming back from the dead and recognizing it's being persecuted, that's all
[03:43:08.360 --> 03:43:13.640]  because you are the core, listening to M4 Wars around the world, the eyes and ears of liberty,
[03:43:14.520 --> 03:43:21.080]  that were immune or at least resistant to the globalist programming. Everybody knows
[03:43:21.960 --> 03:43:26.920]  who studies this, that it's Christians, real Christians who tend to be immune to the
[03:43:26.920 --> 03:43:31.320]  globalist brainwashing and who tend to see it. And that's why they're trying to eradicate you.
[03:43:31.320 --> 03:43:38.440]  But regardless, this fight is intensifying. 2018 has been insane. 2019 is going to be the big
[03:43:38.440 --> 03:43:44.040]  decision maker and I am so honored to be here with you right beside me. Not behind us, but right
[03:43:44.040 --> 03:43:47.800]  beside us and at the heart of everything, resisting these globalists. So whatever you do,
[03:43:47.800 --> 03:44:02.280]  take action and realize we're changing history together and I salute you.
[03:44:47.960 --> 03:44:58.600]  The globalists are trying to set up a private corporate world government that's above the law.
[03:44:59.560 --> 03:45:04.520]  If there's any opposition, if there's any independent media, they can call the fact
[03:45:04.520 --> 03:45:10.280]  that the emperor has no clothes, they can call BS, it's game over. But if you look at everybody
[03:45:10.280 --> 03:45:14.760]  else like Michael Savage and Rush Limbaugh and Tucker Carlson and Sean Hannity, they are all
[03:45:14.760 --> 03:45:21.080]  beholded to the networks they're on that can be targeted. There's only two groups in the U.S.,
[03:45:21.080 --> 03:45:26.760]  Infowars and Matt Drudge of drudgereport.com that are truly independent. And of course,
[03:45:26.760 --> 03:45:31.880]  they're two of the dominant media forces in the world. It really is amazing. That's why as we
[03:45:31.880 --> 03:45:36.600]  close out 2018, I want to just remind the listeners of the amazing fight we're all in and how far
[03:45:36.600 --> 03:45:40.440]  we've come together. Just remind you that you are the power, you're the strength, you're the will

[03:46:52.360 --> 03:47:00.280]  You're listening to The Alex Jones Show.
[03:47:00.280 --> 03:47:21.560]  You've found it, the tip of the spear. It is The Alex Jones Show with Mike Adams.
[03:47:21.560 --> 03:47:31.800]  I want to bring in a reminder of how evil the tech giants really are. It was five years ago
[03:47:32.520 --> 03:47:39.800]  that Whole Foods promised they would label all GMOs by the end of 2018. And no, we haven't forgotten.
[03:47:40.360 --> 03:47:45.400]  We've been waiting for this day to find out if Whole Foods would keep its promise or betray
[03:47:45.400 --> 03:47:51.720]  its customers. Now, five years ago in 2013, they posted a statement on their website that said,
[03:47:51.720 --> 03:47:58.120]  quote, we have set a deadline that by 2018, all products in our US and Canadian stores
[03:47:58.120 --> 03:48:03.800]  must be labeled to indicate whether they contain genetically modified organisms. Whole Foods market
[03:48:03.800 --> 03:48:10.600]  is the first national grocery chain to set a deadline for full GMO transparency. That's what
[03:48:10.600 --> 03:48:17.160]  they said five years ago. Today, they have modified that statement and they have failed
[03:48:17.800 --> 03:48:23.080]  to meet their deadline. They say today, quote, as always, our goal is to provide our customer
[03:48:23.080 --> 03:48:31.400]  with information to help make informed choices, period. That's it. So of course, Bezos, well,
[03:48:31.400 --> 03:48:37.000]  Amazon purchased Whole Foods and that's the time I believe that that statement was modified.
[03:48:37.000 --> 03:48:42.600]  And that's the time I believe they abandoned their commitment to label GMOs. But they're counting
[03:48:42.600 --> 03:48:47.480]  on you not remembering anything. I mean, five years ago, seems like an eternity in today's
[03:48:47.480 --> 03:48:52.360]  news cycle. Who's going to remember that Whole Foods promised to label GMOs five years ago?
[03:48:53.000 --> 03:48:59.640]  Apparently not very many people. And so they betrayed their customers. They lied. Whole Foods,
[03:48:59.640 --> 03:49:07.160]  they are liars. And Jeff Bezos is a liar and a deceiver. And if I told you all the products
[03:49:07.160 --> 03:49:13.960]  that we have tested in our lab from amazon.com that are full of heavy metals and glyphosate
[03:49:13.960 --> 03:49:19.400]  and pesticides, you would be astonished. But that's the truth. That's the simple truth. So
[03:49:20.200 --> 03:49:24.200]  remember that I'm going to do a story on that. In fact, I might suggest to the Info Wars crew
[03:49:24.200 --> 03:49:29.480]  that you might send somebody out there and go shopping at Whole Foods on camera and see if
[03:49:29.480 --> 03:49:35.000]  anything's labeled GMO and call them out on that because they need to be, of course, held accountable
[03:49:35.000 --> 03:49:41.320]  for their lies to the public. This is just a great example of how food has been weaponized
[03:49:41.320 --> 03:49:49.000]  against the people. And that's one of the themes really from 2016 to today is the mass weaponization
[03:49:49.000 --> 03:49:54.760]  of every sector of society, of every institution where science has become weaponized against the
[03:49:54.760 --> 03:50:00.440]  people. Food, as I mentioned, but also medicine, the massive psychiatric drugging of children,
[03:50:00.440 --> 03:50:05.720]  the massive antidepressant drugging of adults, the statin drugs that harm and kill people,
[03:50:05.720 --> 03:50:11.720]  but are just prescribed like candy. Even history has been weaponized. The liberals are altering
[03:50:11.720 --> 03:50:16.200]  history to try to make you think something different about what actually happened, to try to get you
[03:50:16.200 --> 03:50:23.240]  to hate your own country and hate the founding fathers. News has been weaponized. Of course,
[03:50:23.240 --> 03:50:30.600]  news is all fake news now from the corporate-run media. Look at the Jim Acosta video where he
[03:50:30.600 --> 03:50:37.800]  shoved that woman's hand down her arm, that White House intern, and then the media said
[03:50:37.800 --> 03:50:42.280]  that when Paul Joseph Watson covered it, said, oh, it was doctored. Now, you want to talk about
[03:50:42.280 --> 03:50:47.480]  doctored. You can't get more doctored than CNN. They doctor almost everything. They twist everything.
[03:50:48.120 --> 03:50:55.640]  And so this is a time of the incredible weaponization of every institution against humanity.
[03:50:56.280 --> 03:51:00.920]  And yet, at the same time, and here I'm going to bring in the positive side of this a little bit,
[03:51:00.920 --> 03:51:08.360]  at the same time, we have access now to the most incredible brain-enhancing nutrition
[03:51:08.360 --> 03:51:15.720]  and supplements and superfoods that have ever been known in the history of humanity. And this
[03:51:15.720 --> 03:51:21.160]  isn't even a store plug or anything. It's just acknowledging that you look at these superfoods
[03:51:21.160 --> 03:51:27.400]  and these spices like turmeric. We cover turmeric almost every day, it seems. I've got a website,
[03:51:27.400 --> 03:51:32.760]  turmeric.news. You could just look at the headlines there. And InfoWars store sells
[03:51:32.760 --> 03:51:39.160]  various turmeric products, I believe. Bodies is one of them. But just look at turmeric. It is a
[03:51:39.160 --> 03:51:46.680]  miracle superfood. And it's available to us today in a way that wasn't available to just
[03:51:46.680 --> 03:51:53.160]  three or four generations ago, or not even that. People in the early 1900s, it was hard to get
[03:51:53.160 --> 03:52:00.440]  turmeric. It was hard to get many of these spices, like star anise spice, which is in Chinese medicine.
[03:52:00.440 --> 03:52:06.920]  And it is one of the Chinese medicine cures for bird flu, for example, and pandemics.
[03:52:08.040 --> 03:52:14.600]  There's so many incredible superfoods that we now have access to. And you see that in people who
[03:52:15.800 --> 03:52:20.520]  take advantage of good nutrition, they keep getting smarter and smarter and more informed
[03:52:20.520 --> 03:52:25.800]  and more aware. But people that live on junk food, processed food, GMO food sold by Whole Foods,
[03:52:25.800 --> 03:52:31.560]  they keep getting dumber. They keep getting just less aware, their worldview becomes more and more
[03:52:31.560 --> 03:52:38.680]  narrow. They act like parrots or sheeple all the time. And there's almost no more what I call
[03:52:38.680 --> 03:52:45.960]  nutritional middle class. There's either people who are taking in good nutrition, or there's people
[03:52:45.960 --> 03:52:49.960]  who are just living on junk foods and processed foods. And that includes a lot of vegans too.
[03:52:49.960 --> 03:52:55.160]  A lot of vegan junk food people, they're eating Cheetos are like, ah, it's vegan. Yeah, but it's
[03:52:55.160 --> 03:53:00.920]  junk food. You know, veganism is supposed to be healthy. Why are you eating junk food vegan food?
[03:53:00.920 --> 03:53:06.280]  Makes no sense. But you see, it comes down to your choice. And that's why I said previously,
[03:53:06.280 --> 03:53:12.920]  humanity has this powerful choice. You can choose to protect your neurology. I'm telling you,
[03:53:12.920 --> 03:53:18.040]  we publish stories every day that talk about foods that protect against Alzheimer's and dementia,
[03:53:18.040 --> 03:53:23.880]  neuroprotective foods. You can consume those now and you can protect your brain and your
[03:53:23.880 --> 03:53:28.200]  consciousness and your awareness for the rest of your life. There are foods that protect your
[03:53:28.200 --> 03:53:34.440]  heart foods that protect your your pancreas and blood sugar and metabolism. You can choose to do
[03:53:34.440 --> 03:53:40.200]  that. Or you can live a life on junk food and GMOs and pesticides and eat glyphosate until you die.
[03:53:40.200 --> 03:53:44.040]  But of course, the medical establishment will make a lot of money off of you during your suffering
[03:53:44.040 --> 03:53:48.760]  and death because that's the model. That's the racket food is a weapon system to make you a
[03:53:48.760 --> 03:53:55.560]  patient of the pharmaceutical medical system. And the way to opt out of that, the way to free
[03:53:55.560 --> 03:54:03.080]  yourself from that is to stop eating their damn poison. Stop eating their poison and start nourishing
[03:54:03.080 --> 03:54:07.800]  yourself. Start eating real food or even growing some of your own food. It doesn't all have to be
[03:54:07.800 --> 03:54:12.840]  supplements or superfoods. You can grow your own medicine. It's incredible. You can grow oregano.
[03:54:12.840 --> 03:54:20.360]  You can you can grow, you know, cilantro even has detoxification properties. You can grow your own
[03:54:20.360 --> 03:54:26.120]  food or you can do a combination of growing it and buying it from somebody else. This is how,
[03:54:26.120 --> 03:54:32.360]  believe it or not, this is how you defeat the globalists is look, you can't beat the globalists
[03:54:32.360 --> 03:54:37.640]  if your brain doesn't work. And half of the attacks on humanity today are attacks on your
[03:54:37.640 --> 03:54:44.680]  neurology. It is the aluminum and the mercury in the vaccines. It is the psychiatric drugs that
[03:54:44.680 --> 03:54:49.480]  the psychotropic effects that they generate. It is the heavy metals in the food supply. It is the
[03:54:49.480 --> 03:54:55.240]  pesticides. They are especially dangerous to cognitive function. This is all a weapon system.
[03:54:56.120 --> 03:55:00.760]  You can avoid it by choosing clean food and by choosing supplements that protect you
[03:55:00.760 --> 03:55:05.720]  from those things. Like I've said this before, I call it defensive eating. If you go eat a barbecue
[03:55:05.720 --> 03:55:11.960]  meal, which I enjoy from time to time too, let's say you eat brisket. Well, brisket is slightly
[03:55:11.960 --> 03:55:15.960]  burned. The fat is burned. That's part of what gives it a good flavor. But those are
[03:55:15.960 --> 03:55:20.760]  cancer causing chemicals in that burning of the fat. But how can you enjoy it and keep yourself
[03:55:20.760 --> 03:55:26.600]  safe at the same time? It's very simple. Take vitamin C and then eat your brisket because
[03:55:26.600 --> 03:55:33.560]  vitamin C counteracts most of the effects of the oxidation of that burned barbecue or you could
[03:55:33.560 --> 03:55:40.680]  eat raw cabbage. Raw cabbage, guess what? Number one ingredient in coleslaw, serve with barbecue.
[03:55:40.680 --> 03:55:46.120]  So if you eat coleslaw or a salad or take some vitamin C or eat some strawberries, which are
[03:55:46.120 --> 03:55:52.760]  naturally rich in vitamin C, then you can enjoy some brisket. You can enjoy a hamburger. You don't
[03:55:52.760 --> 03:55:57.720]  have to be a food Nazi. In other words, if you know how to defend yourself. And I think that
[03:55:57.720 --> 03:56:03.320]  for 2019, I think what I'm going to really work to contribute to info wars is unique information
[03:56:03.320 --> 03:56:08.520]  that probably no one else can bring to the table here, which is how can you defend yourself
[03:56:09.080 --> 03:56:15.320]  when you go out to eat, eat at a restaurant or you eat sweets at a wedding party or a celebration
[03:56:15.320 --> 03:56:19.240]  or something? How do you protect yourself against that? Because there are things that you can take.
[03:56:19.240 --> 03:56:25.400]  There are things that you can do beforehand so that you can still enjoy society or eating out
[03:56:25.400 --> 03:56:29.480]  with friends or so on, but you're protecting your brain at the same time. And I'll tell you right
[03:56:29.480 --> 03:56:34.680]  now that turmeric is absolutely one of those solutions. Turmeric is just incredible. It is
[03:56:34.680 --> 03:56:39.320]  probably the number one most important food that you need to take in. So you can get it in curry.
[03:56:39.320 --> 03:56:44.120]  You can go buy turmeric spice. You can just dump it into your smoothie. I do that every day.
[03:56:44.680 --> 03:56:49.320]  I've done that for years and or you can get turmeric supplements, you know, like like at
[03:56:49.320 --> 03:56:57.640]  infowarstore.com. They've got some. But when you have this knowledge, your brain becomes bulletproof
[03:56:57.640 --> 03:57:02.920]  in essence, you know, against the toxins. I don't mean physically bulletproof, but you'll be able
[03:57:02.920 --> 03:57:06.840]  to protect yourself. And that's how we defeat the globalists. We've got to have that nutritional
[03:57:06.840 --> 03:57:12.440]  basis. And that's the good news for 2019 and beyond. So I'm Mike Adams, the health ranger. I'm a
[03:57:12.440 --> 03:57:16.840]  food scientist. That's what I'm going to really work to bring you in 2019. Thank you for joining
