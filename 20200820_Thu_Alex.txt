[00:00.000 --> 00:13.800]  Theory is this belief that you are secretly saving the world from this
[00:13.800 --> 00:20.680]  cytanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals. Does that sound like something you are
[00:20.680 --> 00:27.640]  behind? Well I haven't heard that but is that supposed to be a bad thing or a
[00:27.640 --> 00:33.720]  good thing? If I can help save the world from problems I'm willing to do it.
[00:33.720 --> 00:37.800]  I'm willing to put myself out there and we are actually we're saving the world
[00:37.800 --> 00:44.440]  from a radical left philosophy that will destroy this country and when this
[00:44.440 --> 00:50.520]  country is gone the rest of the world would follow the rest of the world would
[00:50.520 --> 00:55.960]  follow. The media the controlled corporate globalist enemy of the people
[00:55.960 --> 01:03.320]  the Chai Kong mouthpieces are trying to gaslight us that there isn't a open
[01:03.320 --> 01:09.200]  push like there was in the 60s to normal what is homosexuality there is now a
[01:09.200 --> 01:15.000]  push to normalize pedophilia and the left has now added the word P to the
[01:15.000 --> 01:25.920]  LGBTQ SQRC WXYP situation and so I was sitting back today when I saw that
[01:25.920 --> 01:31.200]  clip last night thinking about it this morning and I was thinking about all the
[01:31.200 --> 01:36.760]  open pedophilia all the open satanic cults all the companies using baby parts
[01:36.760 --> 01:40.840]  and vaccines and baby parts to heat hospitals and keeping babies alive to
[01:40.840 --> 01:48.240]  harvest their organs in China wrapping baby fetuses in gold foil so the elites
[01:48.240 --> 01:53.120]  can eat them this is all mainstream news and all the giant pedophilia bust and
[01:53.120 --> 02:01.400]  all the Netflix shows sexualizing little kids and salon and vice and HBO and the
[02:01.400 --> 02:07.760]  New York Times legitimizing pedophilia shows showing four-year-old girls
[02:07.760 --> 02:11.120]  dancing scantily clad with a pedo talking about how much you want to have
[02:11.120 --> 02:19.400]  sex with them I mean this is sick sick sick stuff and if we don't value our
[02:19.400 --> 02:25.640]  young we don't value anybody so now they have shows with nine ten eleven year
[02:25.640 --> 02:30.920]  olds we're becoming these little sluts and twerking for everybody and all of
[02:30.920 --> 02:38.680]  this is designed to screw children up and to destroy their innocence and the
[02:38.680 --> 02:45.800]  currency that Hollywood operates off of is pedophilia that's its frequency look
[02:45.800 --> 02:48.800]  at the Catholic Church taken over by it look at all these big institutions all
[02:48.800 --> 02:54.720]  these big universities it's a plague they always say Jones put out the
[02:54.720 --> 03:00.360]  discredited pizza game theory none of it was true the only pedophilia supposedly
[03:00.360 --> 03:03.920]  in the world was in a pizza place I never said that the media made it the
[03:03.920 --> 03:07.720]  issue they set everybody up to cover something because it wasn't happening
[03:07.720 --> 03:12.480]  there to divert from all the places it was happening and the media said Jones
[03:12.480 --> 03:15.040]  admitted wasn't happening there and I said yeah you're the ones that first
[03:15.040 --> 03:19.680]  said it but yeah it's happening right over here not there and they turn that
[03:19.680 --> 03:25.560]  into their defense of it but everyone sees right through it but the influences
[03:25.560 --> 03:30.400]  of it are absolutely massive and its tentacles reach into every level you
[03:30.400 --> 03:36.680]  know I've recently had to disassociate myself from certain people and I had to
[03:36.680 --> 03:40.120]  the very heavy heart that I'm gonna have to expose the situation I'm not gonna do
[03:40.120 --> 03:47.760]  it today I got too much going on but this this this whole evil is right under
[03:47.760 --> 03:57.040]  the surface and it's coming out on to the open ground now and we're going to
[03:57.040 --> 04:02.640]  have to deal with it we're going to have to face all of this ladies and gentlemen
[04:02.640 --> 04:07.520]  or we don't have any future any hope we have a serious evil problem in this
[04:07.520 --> 04:11.200]  country and on this world and Trump isn't perfect but you know what he's a
[04:11.200 --> 04:15.240]  good guy and the evil hates him and the evil hates me and the evil hates you now
[04:15.240 --> 04:19.600]  obviously Stephen Bannon was arrested Southern District of New York they're
[04:19.600 --> 04:23.360]  the ones trying to get all the Trump supporters I don't like Stephen Bannon
[04:23.360 --> 04:29.680]  he's done some nasty stuff he bear false witness against Roger Stone but now you
[04:29.680 --> 04:35.120]  see him with a private border wall that raised tens of millions of dollars and
[04:35.120 --> 04:39.360]  then they kept a hunk of $100,000 apiece for their expenses and things
[04:39.360 --> 04:43.000]  since when can you not start something like that and have it set up and you get
[04:43.000 --> 04:47.120]  money I mean look at the left they got billions of the Clinton Foundation for
[04:47.120 --> 04:52.120]  treason so I don't like this one bit I think it's a serious situation but you
[04:52.120 --> 04:56.600]  see what they did to Steve Bannon after he worked for him though
[04:58.320 --> 05:02.880]  constantly whether it's the New York Times the Washington Post or Howard
[05:02.880 --> 05:06.200]  Stern of a blue name and they come out and they attack him full-war saying
[05:06.200 --> 05:10.840]  Jones claims civil wars coming and financial collapse and planetary
[05:10.840 --> 05:15.240]  lockdowns using viruses and he tells people they should get off the grid and
[05:15.240 --> 05:20.040]  get prepared and have horrible food if they can and now everything I've warned
[05:20.040 --> 05:24.080]  people about is coming true because it was all in the Rockefeller Foundation
[05:24.080 --> 05:29.520]  documents like lockstep this is the corporate planetary takeover so yes I
[05:29.520 --> 05:34.040]  stand by what I said ten years ago what I said a year ago and what I said last

[06:44.560 --> 06:49.080]  so much of it now breaks in the evening because the establishment is burying
[06:49.080 --> 06:53.160]  information in the evening hoping in the news cycle that used to last weeks now
[06:53.160 --> 06:58.080]  last days or even hours that we forget about things that's why starting next

[07:37.000 --> 07:41.120]  holidays and Christmas and things we will do things like take compilations of
[07:41.120 --> 07:46.760]  the daytime shows and have someone that tapes some clips and then tape to air for
[07:46.760 --> 07:51.360]  the three-hour show every night but that will be that'll be announced the time
[07:51.360 --> 07:55.280]  but right through the election and the turmoil and the rioting and the
[07:55.280 --> 07:59.280]  globalist attempt to take down America this is the fight for the Republic this
[07:59.280 --> 08:06.560]  is historic time and we're gonna be here live not just from 8 a.m. until 10 o'clock

[08:43.520 --> 08:48.160]  for your full commitment when we go live to share the links from Bandai video
[08:48.160 --> 08:52.040]  and info wars.com and news wars.com and to call people and to tell them to tune
[08:52.040 --> 08:57.200]  in because that's what causes the chain reaction when you get excited millions
[08:57.200 --> 09:01.960]  of new people tune in when you don't get excited we lose so you're just as
[09:01.960 --> 09:06.040]  important in this revolutionary war against the new world order to save our
[09:06.040 --> 09:10.280]  Republic from this globalist revolution then George Washington was to found the
[09:10.280 --> 09:16.360]  country we are at that magic game time moment so I asked you for your support
[09:16.360 --> 09:20.080]  your word of mouth your prayers your financial support and I asked you to
[09:20.080 --> 09:23.640]  pray for the operation and to really support the crew and I'll ask the crew
[09:23.640 --> 09:27.840]  to realize you're in historic position and to step up to the plate and I know
[09:27.840 --> 09:33.280]  they will all right let me talk about the point we are in history then I'll
[09:33.280 --> 09:37.600]  come back in at all the news tell you the guest are today Steve Bannon arrested
[09:37.600 --> 09:42.680]  this morning right after Obama's speech right before Biden's speech to discredit
[09:42.680 --> 09:47.360]  the wall to make it look like Trump did something bad the same company got some
[09:47.360 --> 09:51.000]  of the contracts to build the wall this is to embroil Trump in a new wall
[09:51.000 --> 10:01.000]  scandal Bannon is so slippery and so nasty from what I've seen that he might
[10:01.000 --> 10:05.440]  be in on this meeting with Epstein before he died meeting with the Clintons
[10:05.440 --> 10:10.080]  and others reportedly that they could have put him into the indictment so that
[10:10.080 --> 10:13.400]  he can now try to implicate Trump or something which is totally asinine
[10:13.400 --> 10:18.280]  Trump distance himself what four or five months ago from that wall saying you
[10:18.280 --> 10:22.600]  know that they're trying to embarrass him we've already built 600 miles of wall
[10:22.600 --> 10:26.200]  Trump's really tried done his best job with all the environmental issues and
[10:26.200 --> 10:29.920]  people blocking I don't trust Bannon as far as you can throw him he told the
[10:29.920 --> 10:36.520]  House intelligence at the Senate intelligence committee that this is
[10:36.520 --> 10:40.680]  important that he never talked to WikiLeaks that Roger Stone never talked
[10:40.680 --> 10:47.080]  to WikiLeaks then a few years later he tells the kangaroo court at Judge Amy
[10:47.080 --> 10:57.360]  Merman Jackson's operation in DC that stone was their direct line to WikiLeaks
[10:57.360 --> 11:01.600]  and was the WikiLeaks expert and then he told Trump that I was there at the time
[11:01.600 --> 11:05.960]  when the conversations were happening I know what was going on it's not true
[11:05.960 --> 11:09.400]  it's not about defending Roger Stone that's a side issue it's about
[11:09.400 --> 11:14.400]  defending reality so he bore false witnessing as Roger Stone on record he
[11:14.400 --> 11:18.240]  perjured himself so when I got a text message a few hours ago Bannon arrested
[11:18.240 --> 11:21.840]  before I went and checked it and found what it was I thought oh for perjury to
[11:21.840 --> 11:31.720]  Congress no so I don't trust this as far as I could throw Steve Bannon's dandruff
[11:31.720 --> 11:38.280]  covered body because he is like a disgusting person and he's a Hollywood
[11:38.280 --> 11:43.440]  you know operative that just longed on to our information and opportunistically
[11:43.440 --> 11:46.400]  then poses a patriot then brought in all the globalists in the administration I
[11:46.400 --> 11:54.200]  don't like Steve Bannon that said this is important I don't like seeing this
[11:54.200 --> 11:58.120]  happen to him because they raised 20 something million dollars for that and
[11:58.120 --> 12:02.480]  they're charging the three-head dudes they only got a couple hundred thousand
[12:02.480 --> 12:06.240]  dollars a piece to be out at the border every week and to fly around and do all
[12:06.240 --> 12:11.000]  that after you pay taxes after you pay expenses that's nothing and if we're
[12:11.000 --> 12:14.960]  gonna have the NRA taken down by the Attorney General in New York
[12:14.960 --> 12:21.520]  excuse me out of Freud and slip we're gonna have the NRA taken down by the
[12:21.520 --> 12:26.440]  corrupt Attorney General Leticia James and we're gonna have Bannon by the
[12:26.440 --> 12:31.320]  Southern District of New York the FBI that's going after everybody but Bill
[12:31.320 --> 12:35.000]  Clinton could get four billion dollars in their foundation for paper play and
[12:35.000 --> 12:38.960]  destroy all the emails and get caught shipping little kids kidnapped out of
[12:38.960 --> 12:45.480]  Haiti and the missile secrets to China and on and on and on and Joe Biden and
[12:45.480 --> 12:50.360]  Burisma and Joe Biden and China and Joe Biden endorsing China to run America and
[12:50.360 --> 12:56.000]  all the real tyranny it'd be one thing of all the globalists were indicted then
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.800]  they got Steve Bannon for something but reading the indictment what I could find
[13:00.800 --> 13:05.640]  up this morning it's nothing they said that they misled the public about where
[13:05.640 --> 13:11.480]  the money was going if you're the executives managing building the last
[13:11.480 --> 13:16.400]  time I heard like 25 million they raised or something that sounds about right
[13:16.400 --> 13:22.800]  people running projects that big couple hundred I mean that's not a crime
[13:22.800 --> 13:28.160]  ladies and gentlemen but what do you expect to happen to a little liar not
[13:28.160 --> 13:33.400]  worse than a stool pigeon like Bannon who went and bore false witness against
[13:33.400 --> 13:37.920]  Roger Stone because let me tell you Roger Stone was trying to get a job here at
[13:37.920 --> 13:44.080]  the time he was already on the show and I said yeah get me WikiLeaks get me
[13:44.080 --> 13:49.240]  Manafort get me Bannon all those establishment guys wouldn't come on
[13:49.240 --> 13:54.320]  even WikiLeaks was on you know ABC News all the time and CNN they wouldn't give
[13:54.320 --> 13:56.640]  us the time of day I didn't need them to give us the time of day I just wanted
[13:56.640 --> 14:01.640]  Roger to get us some big guests and I said if you could be like a booker that
[14:01.640 --> 14:06.320]  got big guest for a political show that you do cover the election and then and
[14:06.320 --> 14:11.680]  the aftermath of the election then I will hire you for what he wanted which was
[14:11.680 --> 14:14.760]  a big sum of money he'd been a consultant for Fox who's paid by Fox he
[14:14.760 --> 14:17.880]  didn't want that you know said at the time because Fox doesn't want you to
[14:17.880 --> 14:21.240]  know that most of their contributors are paid and that's kind of how they
[14:21.240 --> 14:25.840]  control what you say and what you do so I was there and I know he didn't do that
[14:25.840 --> 14:29.760]  and I know they investigated me in the WikiLeaks thing and I know they had
[14:29.760 --> 14:33.480]  grand juries out on me and I tell you they've had grand juries I'm like oh
[14:33.480 --> 14:40.480]  yeah Jones they got grand juries out on you yeah the very same people do and so
[14:40.480 --> 14:45.800]  I know what it's like to have done nothing nothing and you're under
[14:45.800 --> 14:50.440]  investigation for being a Russian spy and you tune into the House Armed
[14:50.440 --> 14:53.520]  Services Committee and they're calling you a Russian agent with no proof and
[14:53.520 --> 14:56.640]  you don't get to face your accuser at least in the McCarthy hearings you got
[14:56.640 --> 15:01.320]  to go face your accusers and then the Senate Intelligence Committee said to
[15:01.320 --> 15:08.200]  save America we must destroy Alex Jones these are quotes and then I'm a Russian
[15:08.200 --> 15:12.960]  no I'm a loyal American stopping your chai-com takeover there was a Russian
[15:12.960 --> 15:19.760]  takeover I'd be a Russaphobe on their butt so fast like a bird dog on a quail
[15:19.760 --> 15:25.440]  it just got blasted out of the grass but that's not what's happening here I'm a
[15:25.440 --> 15:28.680]  loyal American and they know the grassroots listen to us so they want
[15:28.680 --> 15:31.520]  to just credit it in silence so I wouldn't be surprised they can guide me in
[15:31.520 --> 15:35.720]  the next month that's what this is all about so they can strut around and say
[15:35.720 --> 15:39.840]  they're the good guys and we're all the criminals you know where is the killing
[15:39.840 --> 15:43.960]  on indictments of the criminals where's all that magic stuff you got one of them
[15:43.960 --> 15:48.080]  finally indicted and that's Durham and that's what's happening there so when we
[15:48.080 --> 15:52.760]  come back ladies and gentlemen we're gonna get into Trump Bannon and all this

[18:27.560 --> 18:33.600]  president trump gets asked yesterday by one of these mask-wearing cult members
[18:33.600 --> 18:39.320]  in the white house press corps the disinformation corps fighting our country
[18:39.320 --> 18:48.680]  if he is aware of he disavows this whole quote you know QAnon movement or
[18:48.680 --> 18:55.840]  whatever that thinks that there are devil worshipers with children and that
[18:55.840 --> 19:01.080]  there's also cannibalism going on and that he's saving the world from it and
[19:01.080 --> 19:05.480]  then trump goes well that'd be a good thing if I was what the media does is
[19:05.480 --> 19:11.280]  they create a cartoon image of you know millions of children underground and
[19:11.280 --> 19:16.680]  and but are their children literally an underground basements are their children
[19:16.680 --> 19:20.400]  that have been found in basements absolutely but they create a cartoon
[19:20.400 --> 19:28.200]  image of that hoping that discredits the 10-plus fold increase in child
[19:28.200 --> 19:32.640]  molesters child rapist being busted and the fact there's a whole underground
[19:32.640 --> 19:38.200]  that's now coming out in the media saying pedophilia is a good thing and how
[19:38.200 --> 19:43.640]  these pedophile networks have taken over major institutions like Penn State and
[19:43.640 --> 19:50.400]  the Vatican the list goes on and on this is how this group got us to compromise
[19:50.400 --> 19:54.320]  our souls as a nation as a species as a world and now they're trying to
[19:54.320 --> 19:59.360]  externalize it and make it normal and that's why they have pedophile drag
[19:59.360 --> 20:03.560]  queen story time with convicted pedophiles in many cases coming in not
[20:03.560 --> 20:08.400]  even telling you on career day your third graders gonna be bouncing on their
[20:08.400 --> 20:13.160]  knee trump has signed executive orders to expand introduction of human
[20:13.160 --> 20:17.760]  trafficking it's exploded he's got the navy and the army involved stopping it
[20:17.760 --> 20:22.920]  and they're having huge bust of small children kidnapped and Laura Sillsby got
[20:22.920 --> 20:26.640]  caught running Clinton's Foundation shipping thousands of Haitian kids out
[20:26.640 --> 20:31.200]  she got a slap on the wrist somewhere found dead AP did a whole investigation on
[20:31.200 --> 20:39.240]  it she changed her name and she runs the database for amber alert today people
[20:39.240 --> 20:43.560]  hear that they go look it up they're blown away it's true so this is their
[20:43.560 --> 20:48.200]  currency this is how they corrupt people it's how they make money and it is a
[20:48.200 --> 20:56.440]  giant underground are they putting kids in wayfarer cabinets and shipping them
[20:56.440 --> 21:03.840]  around no are they advertising expensive things online that you buy to
[21:03.840 --> 21:13.960]  launder the money and then you get a child delivered ab so frickin lootly and
[21:13.960 --> 21:18.160]  so as this all comes out Trump handles it perfectly saying well it's a good
[21:18.160 --> 21:23.560]  thing because we're trying to save the soul of humanity but the way they do
[21:23.560 --> 21:26.960]  most the child killing is they keep babies alive get the mother to say they
[21:26.960 --> 21:32.760]  don't want them they put on the bioethics form not resuscitated they're
[21:32.760 --> 21:36.520]  kept alive but they're not counters living according to the bioethics board
[21:36.520 --> 21:43.160]  the daughter Peter Singer developed 40 years ago that if they decide that you're
[21:43.160 --> 21:48.360]  not a human you're not and you have no value so it's it's an alchemy it's a
[21:48.360 --> 21:52.080]  lawyer scam that's why you have the governor Northam saying we keep the
[21:52.080 --> 21:56.640]  baby comfortable mother decides not to resuscitate she makes the decision
[21:56.640 --> 22:00.240]  resuscitate we keep the baby comfortable but why do you keep it
[22:00.240 --> 22:02.920]  comfortable because they're waiting to get all the orders in and the blood
[22:02.920 --> 22:07.000]  typing in for the harvesting because you kill them around the spot it's hard to
[22:07.000 --> 22:11.960]  get the quote fresh organs out we'll play that coming up but Trump asked you if
[22:11.960 --> 22:17.760]  he supports conspiracy theory that he's saving world from satanic pedophiles
[22:17.760 --> 22:21.680]  well he's fighting ISIS that was kidnapping tens of thousands of women
[22:21.680 --> 22:26.360]  and children as sex slaves torturing him having a hundred men rape a five-year-old
[22:26.360 --> 22:30.720]  girl to death Hillary Clinton's first cases were representing pedophiles that
[22:30.720 --> 22:35.680]  kidnapped and brutally raped little girls the whole Clinton system is just
[22:35.680 --> 22:41.120]  littered with pedophiles and Tony Podesta and and and running you know full
[22:41.120 --> 22:45.240]  page articles about how he loves art of naked children they're throwing it in
[22:45.240 --> 22:50.120]  our face and as I'm speaking you're thinking of thousands of examples you
[22:50.120 --> 22:55.640]  remember of how sick these people are and how they're flaunting it all right
[22:55.640 --> 22:59.160]  there here's the president being asked about yesterday
[22:59.160 --> 23:04.640]  theory it is this belief that you are secretly saving the world from this
[23:04.640 --> 23:11.480]  satanic cult of pedophiles and cannibals does that sound like something you are
[23:11.480 --> 23:18.200]  behind I haven't I haven't heard that but is that supposed to be a bad thing
[23:18.200 --> 23:24.400]  or a good thing if I can help save the world from problems I'm willing to do
[23:24.400 --> 23:28.440]  it I'm willing to put myself out there and we are actually we're saving the
[23:28.440 --> 23:35.120]  world from a radical left philosophy that will destroy this country and when
[23:35.120 --> 23:40.920]  this country is gone the rest of the world would follow the rest of the
[23:40.920 --> 23:45.440]  world would follow there is sex slavery and sex bondage of women and
[23:45.440 --> 23:48.560]  children all over the world right now the UN's been caught
[23:48.560 --> 23:54.120]  typing United Nations in giant child trafficking scandal snuff films UN caught
[23:54.120 --> 23:58.800]  filming snuff films UN caught they'd I mean I've made films about it America
[23:58.800 --> 24:03.200]  destroyed by design a third of the movie is about the UN kidnapping raping
[24:03.200 --> 24:09.320]  transporting children and then killing them it used to be mainstream news now
[24:09.320 --> 24:14.000]  they don't even report it and Trump is fighting that Trump said five years ago
[24:14.000 --> 24:19.840]  we need to find and execute pedophiles now here's the latest Daily Mail article
[24:19.840 --> 24:22.520]  came out two days ago was the top of Twitter they tried to suppress it
[24:22.520 --> 24:27.720]  hashtag Bill Clinton Epstein and there he is with the underage girl that for
[24:27.720 --> 24:34.600]  years was her sex slave massaging him and pass that part go and scroll down show

[24:45.320 --> 24:49.280]  after she'd already been in their clutches four years when she was 18 we
[24:49.280 --> 24:55.600]  exposed this last December in a video at Bandot video that only has 600,000 views
[24:55.600 --> 25:01.120]  it needs 10 million where they're up and running the same network recruiting

[25:06.840 --> 25:12.200]  got planes where you go up in the planes and have sex with women that look
[25:12.200 --> 25:17.120]  like they're 14 15 16 and some are we know the woman that runs it for Epstein
[25:17.120 --> 25:24.320]  was bought when she was 11 as a sex slave out of the Balkans and now we have
[25:24.320 --> 25:32.800]  women in the same outfits with Bill Clinton again can we show the Bandot
[25:32.800 --> 25:38.520]  video article headlined right there Epstein Travelling Network up and

[26:10.720 --> 26:14.560]  witnesses all saw and they saw him on the island of course he did Bill Gates did
[26:14.560 --> 26:21.280]  too we built this network to expose all of this but somebody posted this on
[26:21.280 --> 26:25.240]  YouTube it got a hundred thousand views back in December because we shot this on

[28:10.840 --> 28:16.040]  operation with the forced inoculations and the permanent lockdown of
[28:16.040 --> 28:19.360]  civilization and society they're outlawing people being able to get
[28:19.360 --> 28:23.680]  colds or the flu they're creating artificial phobias for normal death
[28:23.680 --> 28:26.640]  that takes place they're not even promising to have a cure to it all
[28:26.640 --> 28:31.640]  they're just inflicting new phobias on everyone to bring in their planetary
[28:31.640 --> 28:38.360]  regime directed by the WHO with vaccines that actually change your DNA and make
[28:38.360 --> 28:46.680]  you owned by Microsoft it's a final frontier it's the year 2020 it's not
[28:46.680 --> 28:54.720]  coming it's here and submission is blood in the water I'm gonna say
[28:54.720 --> 28:58.320]  something right now it is one of the most important things I've ever said so
[28:58.320 --> 29:04.000]  please listen very very carefully Donald Trump is not the reason they
[29:04.000 --> 29:08.040]  released COVID or had the lockdown they already had this plan the Rockefeller
[29:08.040 --> 29:14.400]  Foundation and Bill and Melinda Gates it is beyond critical it is life and death
[29:14.400 --> 29:17.400]  for you and your family to understand about a real little planet but this is
[29:17.400 --> 29:24.560]  a worldwide world government takeover on record that it's never going to end the
[29:24.560 --> 29:28.360]  United Nations has admitted that first it's a month then it's six months then
[29:28.360 --> 29:33.040]  they say okay it's two years they're now saying two years they're now saying
[29:33.040 --> 29:38.000]  you'll never go back to normal no more gatherings no more anything constant
[29:38.000 --> 29:42.280]  forced inoculations that they admit don't even work and the way they say
[29:42.280 --> 29:48.120]  they work they change your DNA this is the culling of the planet this is the
[29:48.120 --> 29:51.720]  beginning of the straitjacket being put on you before you're slowly tortured to
[29:51.720 --> 29:55.480]  death and kill do you understand
[29:55.480 --> 30:12.840]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[30:25.480 --> 30:41.520]  you'll see your problems multiplied
[30:41.520 --> 30:55.360]  because the policy of truth did I continually decide to faithfully pursue a
[30:55.360 --> 31:04.800]  policy of truth yeah well not pursuing a policy of truth may have worked the last
[31:04.800 --> 31:12.560]  50 years we were living off the gas our ancestors put in the tank but now the
[31:12.560 --> 31:17.840]  gas is gone the collapse is here the wolves think humanity is done they're
[31:17.840 --> 31:26.200]  making their move and I do see my problems multiply with the policy of
[31:26.200 --> 31:33.120]  truth but you know what people that try to stay out of trouble they're the ones
[31:33.120 --> 31:36.040]  that get destroyed in the end the worst they're the people that never really
[31:36.040 --> 31:42.800]  live we have gotten in this situation because we've been avoiding conflict we've
[31:42.800 --> 31:47.680]  been avoiding hard work we've been avoiding the truth we've been sweeping
[31:47.680 --> 31:55.560]  everything under the rug well I've not been doing that and I'm not gonna be part
[31:55.560 --> 32:02.720]  of the lie I'm going to expose it we're gonna get back into Steve Bannon being
[32:02.720 --> 32:07.920]  arrested what all that means how that ties in the deep state the latest on
[32:07.920 --> 32:12.400]  COVID-19 the latest on the Democrat horrible convention Trump asked if he
[32:12.400 --> 32:15.800]  supports conspiracy theory conspiracy theory that he's saving the world from
[32:15.800 --> 32:21.440]  satanic pedophiles there are a lot of Satanists are all the pedophiles
[32:21.440 --> 32:28.720]  Trump's fighting them imagine ridiculing that imagine trying to say that that
[32:28.720 --> 32:33.560]  doesn't exist when that's really the benchmark of the New World Order and
[32:33.560 --> 32:39.520]  that's what they're promoting out of every one of their filthy mouthpieces
[32:39.520 --> 32:44.320]  something credible I'm gonna break more of this down in a moment but first off
[32:44.320 --> 32:48.880]  I'm glad to see people are ordering a lot of storable food because it's a good
[32:48.880 --> 32:53.000]  investment it's an insurance you can eat I believe the world's only gonna get
[32:53.000 --> 32:58.000]  crazy in the next decade this is product that's high quality it's a nutrient
[32:58.000 --> 33:02.360]  dense that last 25 years if you just buy food now and eat it in five years you
[33:02.360 --> 33:06.400]  know inflation is gonna be intense you'll save the money that you put into
[33:06.400 --> 33:11.480]  the food just an inflation and I've always said it's good to have some
[33:11.480 --> 33:16.080]  storable food that's what all our ancestors did but where's the canning
[33:16.080 --> 33:21.160]  where's the deep freeze where's the root cellar it's all gone so I've always
[33:21.160 --> 33:27.760]  promoted storable food but when the COVID-19 hit we saw them welding people
[33:27.760 --> 33:30.760]  of their homes and locking things down and shooting women at checkpoints and
[33:30.760 --> 33:36.320]  just all this dystopic crazy stuff I said either it's really deadly or it's a
[33:36.320 --> 33:39.480]  hoax they're gonna use to lock down when they lock down the world it's gonna
[33:39.480 --> 33:44.000]  cause major depression major collapse supply chain problems that's not hard
[33:44.000 --> 33:48.640]  to predict that's all unfolded and now with the lockdown still going on in most
[33:48.640 --> 33:53.040]  the world it's getting more intense so with the globalists in the communist
[33:53.040 --> 33:56.120]  launch of the revolution with them saying they want a civil war with them
[33:56.120 --> 34:01.640]  saying they're gonna contest the election have all these states to seed and
[34:01.640 --> 34:07.760]  have their own inauguration I mean that is crazy town and so I would have a
[34:07.760 --> 34:11.840]  bug out plan of your city's burning I would have firearms and know how to use
[34:11.840 --> 34:15.160]  them we don't sell those I'd have high quality water filtration we got the best
[34:15.160 --> 34:18.880]  for the price you're gonna find gravity fed to go to a river a swamp have the
[34:18.880 --> 34:24.400]  water go through it it's clean and good to drink and we've got great shortwave
[34:24.400 --> 34:27.560]  radios at the best price you're gonna find so you can always get around the
[34:27.560 --> 34:30.840]  internet and pick up worldwide transmissions including this show that's
[34:30.840 --> 34:35.560]  six hours a day on WWCR you're in the day and at night those are great little
[34:35.560 --> 34:43.640]  fun things to have anyways pick up all sorts of crazy stuff not just a MNFM but
[34:43.640 --> 34:48.040]  I do believe you need swarble food and I can tell you talking to our supplier
[34:48.040 --> 34:55.480]  that's the best out there they got caught up being eight weeks behind they
[34:55.480 --> 34:59.680]  told her by they were that you know when they got up to eight weeks they told
[34:59.680 --> 35:02.480]  me we're eight weeks for delivery but we have the food unlike others that
[35:02.480 --> 35:06.360]  were lying and said they did everybody got their food most people before the
[35:06.360 --> 35:12.000]  time they were told now they're one to two weeks depending on what you order
[35:12.000 --> 35:14.600]  some of the specialty stuff takes two weeks to ship out they've got the food
[35:14.600 --> 35:18.600]  on hand but they asked me my opinion they respect it they said what do you
[35:18.600 --> 35:23.080]  think and I said things are gonna go crazy whether Trump wins or loses the
[35:23.080 --> 35:26.200]  world's just gonna get more insane they want a worldwide depression to bring us
[35:26.200 --> 35:31.840]  to our knees I believe that whether it's this year or next year or the year after
[35:31.840 --> 35:38.240]  that that you're gonna be at a point where if the Democrats win they're just
[35:38.240 --> 35:40.720]  gonna come come and do your factories they go yeah we agree with that that's
[35:40.720 --> 35:46.120]  already in the FEMA orders and I just said I would ramp up and just expect
[35:46.120 --> 35:49.560]  more insanity and they said don't we we absolutely agree with that they were
[35:49.560 --> 35:52.560]  asked me a couple years ago what I thought and I told him ramp up so I
[35:52.560 --> 35:55.320]  mean I talked to the owner I talked to the board that they listen to me I
[35:55.320 --> 36:01.440]  listen to them they're smart guys and I mean I just I never bought a piece of
[36:01.440 --> 36:05.160]  property in the country and started digging wells and put in a trailer and
[36:05.160 --> 36:09.280]  solar panels and stuff and you know hiding food and stuff I mean I used to be a
[36:09.280 --> 36:14.160]  hundred percent offense knowing that was the best defense to try to beat these
[36:14.160 --> 36:17.960]  people and I still think we will but regardless the damage is so bad now it's

[37:37.240 --> 37:40.680]  got like seven bottles of antibiotics the last couple years sugar

[37:43.480 --> 37:46.760]  just doing basic stuff like that and you should too ladies and gentlemen because
[37:46.760 --> 37:51.800]  our biggest weakness is that we are domesticated now and we're soft and by
[37:51.800 --> 37:55.280]  the way I'm not when I'm pointing a finger at you three more pointing back at
[37:55.280 --> 38:05.920]  me I am soft I'm soft I mean growing up we had an electrical problem my dad would
[38:05.920 --> 38:09.000]  fix it just as he liked to now and we have an electrical problem I got call
[38:09.000 --> 38:13.440]  electrician I don't know what I'm doing and again and I love my children but I've
[38:13.440 --> 38:19.880]  dropped them all my children my son's great he doesn't know all that stuff I
[38:19.880 --> 38:25.240]  knew and I know like 20% of what my dad did it's scary folks so I'm getting back
[38:25.240 --> 38:32.360]  to things like I used to just shoot guns I didn't shoot them enough to really get
[38:32.360 --> 38:36.920]  them clean properly so I'd wipe them off but I'd take them to a gunsmith say hey
[38:36.920 --> 38:41.840]  check these clean them for me I got my guns out I'm cleaning them all I got my
[38:41.840 --> 38:45.960]  cowboy boots out I'm cleaning those I got my gear I'm checking it all and it's
[38:45.960 --> 38:48.960]  just basic stuff because you know I'll buy guns and stuff it have a big gun safe
[38:48.960 --> 38:53.200]  but I don't ever time to mess with them I got them out I'm out shooting them I'm
[38:53.200 --> 38:58.040]  out getting ready I got I carry a gun now and I'm just telling listeners I
[38:58.040 --> 39:02.880]  know I'm stating common sense stuff here but we're not in a good position right
[39:02.880 --> 39:07.480]  now and we've been all been caught flat-footed and I'm just telling you get
[39:07.480 --> 39:11.600]  ready and then politically get active as much as you can and wake people up and
[39:11.600 --> 39:15.880]  let them know the COVID virus is not causing the shutdown the lie and the

[41:04.600 --> 41:09.320]  course different types of civilizations and countries and political systems of
[41:09.320 --> 41:15.400]  history and the present are mixes of the two but with globalism it is a post
[41:15.400 --> 41:23.520]  human ideology so it's scientifically geared to be oppressive and the rationale
[41:23.520 --> 41:27.960]  is social Darwinism that the ruling class are elites and because they're in
[41:27.960 --> 41:33.440]  power they have a right to rule over you poison you dumb you down sterilize you
[41:33.440 --> 41:38.280]  and kill you so all the people wearing masks like outside at the parking stuff
[41:38.280 --> 41:43.240]  are living in a total hoax and think their act of submission is an act of
[41:43.240 --> 41:47.160]  working for the common good in a collective no it's a sign that you're
[41:47.160 --> 41:50.600]  a slave who will take the force inoculations federal government

[43:56.200 --> 44:19.560]  you're listening to the Alex Jones show
[44:19.560 --> 44:25.720]  we think of stylized devil worshipers the child kidnapped out of the backyard
[44:25.720 --> 44:32.520]  tied up in a basement taken out on all hallows eve beneath the stars and moon
[44:32.520 --> 44:38.840]  to have their skin and body lanced for hours while supplicants of the cult
[44:38.840 --> 44:43.360]  drink their blood before slitting their throats and cutting out their heart and
[44:43.360 --> 44:51.880]  offering to bath a man we think of that as the evil and that's done as
[44:51.880 --> 45:00.080]  stylized satanism in the archetype by this cult oh believe it the Duponts the
[45:00.080 --> 45:04.640]  Rockefellers the Rothschilds they do it and they're on record and they've been
[45:04.640 --> 45:09.720]  caught it's come out and it gets shoveled under the rug but it's still
[45:09.720 --> 45:19.040]  there because it's about selfishness and if you'll hurt a child and steal their
[45:19.040 --> 45:24.440]  future and horrify them and and and and wallow in the evil and do that to
[45:24.440 --> 45:29.280]  yourself then the cult knows you're beyond the point of no return and that
[45:29.280 --> 45:36.000]  you can be trusted to carry out incredibly parasitic predatory garbage
[45:36.000 --> 45:41.600]  you're cut off from God that's why any real evil criminal organization wants
[45:41.600 --> 45:47.120]  you to commit unspeakable crimes against innocence to know that you are now
[45:47.120 --> 45:53.200]  outside of God's control and God's defense because lightness and darkness
[45:53.200 --> 46:01.760]  cannot mix and that's why MS-13 and other Latin American drug cartels make
[46:01.760 --> 46:06.640]  members kidnap 10 11-year-old girls is their favorite and they torture them to
[46:06.640 --> 46:11.200]  death with electricity and with fire and then finally kill them after they rape
[46:11.200 --> 46:14.800]  them I remember reading even in Texas monthly back when it was a good
[46:14.800 --> 46:19.920]  publication when I was in high school about one drug dealer the other drug
[46:19.920 --> 46:26.240]  dealers grabbed in Matamoros and how the guy tortured him for a day in a
[46:26.240 --> 46:32.480]  satanic ritual and he couldn't make the guy cry so the devil worshipper killed
[46:32.480 --> 46:36.960]  him but then committed suicide because Satan was angry at him because he hadn't
[46:36.960 --> 46:42.480]  broken the person's will and gotten the energy of horror and pain
[46:42.480 --> 46:51.960]  so so this is all well known ISIS does the same stuff it's the same thing in
[46:51.960 --> 46:57.240]  history that it's happened throughout history in every archaeological dig in
[46:57.240 --> 47:03.440]  Africa in Europe in Asia in the Americas every culture built pyramid alters they
[47:03.440 --> 47:09.960]  might be 10 feet tall they might be 500 feet tall but they always sacrifice
[47:09.960 --> 47:14.000]  humans to snake guides
[47:15.800 --> 47:25.560]  you think we just cooked this up ourselves no now these type of MS-13
[47:25.560 --> 47:28.800]  tortures young girl to death in ritual it's everywhere and they usually the
[47:28.800 --> 47:31.880]  media covers it up because you're not supposed to know about those type of
[47:31.880 --> 47:35.880]  crimes oh one cop does something wrong kills a black guy it's the biggest news
[47:35.880 --> 47:41.400]  ever because they want to make it about that they abort 30 million black babies
[47:41.400 --> 47:47.720]  nobody cares but think about China with three million Muslims in death camps
[47:47.720 --> 47:51.080]  over a million Christians a million Buddhists in death camps their organs
[47:51.080 --> 47:55.560]  are taken they're sold China's on record shipping baby parts out as an
[47:55.560 --> 48:02.040]  aphrodisiac and as a collagen injection to French companies that then sell it to
[48:02.040 --> 48:07.200]  the West for women's lip injection so you're not killing a baby in a satanic
[48:07.200 --> 48:14.160]  ritual openly trying to be evil you're just so narcissistic and so empty you're
[48:14.160 --> 48:21.400]  doing it out of pure selfishness and don't even care you you're involved in
[48:21.400 --> 48:27.560]  murdering a child it's like Pepsi a court ruled seven eight years ago that in a
[48:27.560 --> 48:31.680]  lawsuit by shareholders they couldn't say what the baby flavoring was for but
[48:31.680 --> 48:38.520]  later it still came out that they test the flavor testing in a chemical test
[48:38.520 --> 48:44.520]  made out of baby parts people say oh the baby parts aren't actually in it so it's
[48:44.520 --> 48:48.800]  okay oh no they just developed the flavor from baby parts and then
[48:48.800 --> 48:56.520]  synthesize it see how that works so when you read about confirmed Chinese
[48:56.520 --> 49:02.460]  communist newspaper endorses Joe Biden Joe Biden is smoother to deal with the
[49:02.460 --> 49:07.680]  Donald Trump you mean he lays down that's the official communist Chinese
[49:07.680 --> 49:12.840]  endorsing him well Trump put out a two-minute ad attacking Biden for
[49:12.840 --> 49:16.400]  openly endorsing China against America and I was thinking of a lot of clips
[49:16.400 --> 49:19.560]  that are worse than what Trump's people are gonna put in this I thought of one
[49:19.560 --> 49:23.320]  from Biden three years ago saying the communist Chinese should be involved in
[49:23.320 --> 49:27.440]  every aspect of her lives telling us how to live in what to do so the
[49:27.440 --> 49:31.320]  communist Chinese take babies organs they take adults organs they kill people
[49:31.320 --> 49:37.800]  they torture people death camps that the bigger than Hitler but the media makes
[49:37.800 --> 49:43.160]  a joke out of it like oh you know Alex Jones or QAnon or these groups said
[49:43.160 --> 49:46.720]  there's also devil worship going on you know to make it sound cartoonish to
[49:46.720 --> 49:49.480]  distract from what they know good and well is going on and they've got a
[49:49.480 --> 49:52.880]  talking point to cover that up so now even though these reporters aren't in
[49:52.880 --> 49:56.560]  there having blood stew or whatever you know they're not actually torturing a
[49:56.560 --> 50:00.760]  baby begging for mommy to get the dark energy that they get off that horror
[50:00.760 --> 50:06.800]  these entities feed off of they still just cover up for the group that's doing
[50:06.800 --> 50:11.920]  it because that's what all this is about the war is the death the killing so
[50:11.920 --> 50:18.040]  here is Trump's new ad Joe Biden won't stand up for the US we doesn't just not
[50:18.040 --> 50:21.440]  stand up for it he attacks it and then we added the other clip at the end here
[50:21.440 --> 50:30.360]  is after the steel mills fell it just all crumbled I'm third generation I've
[50:30.360 --> 50:35.000]  worked the steel mill for a year and a half and now the steel mill ain't even
[50:35.000 --> 50:40.160]  there this is just the way of the world China is an economic rival to the United
[50:40.160 --> 50:46.120]  States does export it does manufacture yes it takes American jobs we want to
[50:46.120 --> 50:53.240]  see China rise China is going to eat our lunch come on man I mean I you know
[50:53.240 --> 50:57.320]  they're not bad folks folks I believe that and I'm even more convinced now
[50:57.320 --> 51:02.200]  that arising China is an incredibly positive development China has made
[51:02.200 --> 51:07.480]  remarkable remarkable strides ABC News investigation this morning into Joe
[51:07.480 --> 51:10.960]  Biden the Sun Hunter in questions about money he made from foreign business
[51:10.960 --> 51:14.680]  dealings while his father was vice president and did Joe Biden allow it
[51:14.680 --> 51:18.080]  we're talking about millions of dollars in at least two countries did you talk
[51:18.080 --> 51:23.120]  about China or your deal with China a 12-hour flight over that never came
[51:23.120 --> 51:27.920]  less than two weeks after that trip BHR partners was launched a private
[51:27.920 --> 51:32.520]  equity fund funded in part by Chinese banks he has come forward and said it
[51:32.520 --> 51:36.960]  was a mistake on his part to be in the board my son's business dealings were
[51:36.960 --> 51:40.360]  not anything word everybody that he's talking about what's your understanding
[51:40.360 --> 51:44.080]  of what your son was doing for an extraordinary amount of money I don't
[51:44.080 --> 51:47.560]  know what he was doing I know he was on the board Hunter Biden holds an equity
[51:47.560 --> 51:50.880]  stake in a company that's taken over a billion and a half dollars and loans from
[51:50.880 --> 51:55.400]  the Chinese government this is obviously an issue what they said is China would
[51:55.400 --> 52:01.280]  prefer Joe Biden China and Iran China and Iran China and Iran want to see Donald
[52:01.280 --> 52:06.120]  Trump's defeat and they're looking for ways to make that happen China is a
[52:06.120 --> 52:10.280]  great nation and we should hope for the continued expansion growth of China is
[52:10.280 --> 52:16.640]  overwhelmingly in our interest and there's much more to come and now the
[52:16.640 --> 52:23.120]  steel mill ain't even there I'm also proud that more than 160 Fortune 500
[52:23.120 --> 52:28.840]  companies are operating in Chengdu high-tech zone including pioneer American
[52:28.840 --> 52:34.160]  businesses like Intel Dell and Oracle the US-China relationship has also
[52:34.160 --> 52:39.960]  improved dramatically in the past 30 years in order to cement this robust
[52:39.960 --> 52:45.840]  partnership we have to go beyond close ties between Washington and Beijing which
[52:45.840 --> 52:51.920]  we're working on every day go beyond it to include all levels of government go
[52:51.920 --> 52:56.200]  beyond it to include classrooms and laboratories athletic fields and board
[52:56.200 --> 53:02.360]  rooms that's why we launched our hundred thousand strong initiative to boost the
[53:02.360 --> 53:09.480]  number of American students studying in China each year has a name ladies and
[53:09.480 --> 53:13.120]  gentlemen it's called treason they took the incredible wealth and power of this
[53:13.120 --> 53:18.480]  country set up bureaucracies and regulations so you and I everyone else
[53:18.480 --> 53:24.200]  couldn't do business and said that's just the way it is they said don't worry
[53:24.200 --> 53:31.960]  though you'll be a service economy and now they told us the movie theaters and
[53:31.960 --> 53:41.480]  the dance studios and the restaurants and the gyms and the nurseries for
[53:41.480 --> 53:46.800]  children and for plants they're not essential unless your Walmart or target
[53:46.800 --> 53:53.320]  or unless your governor Newsom's dozen plus wineries and restaurants they they
[53:53.320 --> 53:57.120]  didn't used to be by the way sold out their profits are way up now you got to
[53:57.120 --> 54:02.800]  them everybody else is closed and that's a microcosm of where Newsom closes all
[54:02.800 --> 54:07.520]  the other wineries but yes just like they closed America but they got to manage
[54:07.520 --> 54:10.880]  the middleman sell out of the country that's why Trump said a few weeks ago
[54:10.880 --> 54:14.720]  they're gonna try to take me out because I'm cutting this off we'll do deals that
[54:14.720 --> 54:18.000]  are fair all day long you want to move to China do it but you're not getting an
[54:18.000 --> 54:23.520]  unfair advantage level playing field that's the way it is and that's why these
[54:23.520 --> 54:27.000]  scumbags look at look at Biden three years ago he could talk he's had another
[54:27.000 --> 54:30.360]  stroke folks and they're so arrogant they just put him up there and don't care
[54:30.360 --> 54:35.040]  and tell you he's fine and his wife has got to go around saying he's
[54:35.040 --> 54:39.400]  cognitively there cuz he's gone cuz they're like the Communist Party it's
[54:39.400 --> 54:46.440]  rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic how do you contest an election in the
[54:46.440 --> 54:53.160]  year 2020 well you trigger race riots and you tell the blue states and blue
[54:53.160 --> 54:56.600]  cities when you're the speaker of the house that you are legitimately now the
[54:56.600 --> 55:01.120]  president that's what she's been said on CBS News and that you're going to have
[55:01.120 --> 55:06.280]  those blue states succeed yes that's officially called a civil war ladies and
[55:06.280 --> 55:10.080]  gentlemen the Democrats are backed by the EU Hollywood the chai comms and the
[55:10.080 --> 55:14.240]  whole globalist system this is treason with a capital T and our federal

[56:56.120 --> 57:01.480]  there's a headline of a band-aid video that's not really accurate that's okay
[57:01.480 --> 57:06.080]  what would you say alex jones predicts globalist calling to the elderly I
[57:06.080 --> 57:09.320]  didn't predict it they said they were already doing it and we're going to
[57:09.320 --> 57:15.560]  expand it so alex jones warned of the covert operation to kill the old people
[57:15.560 --> 57:20.680]  it's now operational and we're going to come back with huge news on the band in
[57:20.680 --> 57:24.000]  front and so much more but here's part of that report full reports at band-aid
[57:24.000 --> 57:34.080]  video now let's move to the main body of news I covered this a lot on the radio
[57:34.080 --> 57:38.200]  today Mike Adams has a big report out on it it actually talks about giving
[57:38.200 --> 57:45.280]  bonuses to hospital workers and doctors to not resuscitate and not save people
[57:45.280 --> 57:50.160]  big hospitals have also been caught taking people's organs this guy Joe
[57:50.160 --> 57:54.320]  Klein talks about how troublesome his parents were and all the things they did
[57:54.320 --> 57:59.000]  when they were old and well then his dad had broken a rib and they said if he ever
[57:59.000 --> 58:05.160]  gets resuscitated he may break another rib and he says well my dad's tough it's
[58:05.160 --> 58:12.040]  a pretty amazing quote he said so I approve do not resuscitate order for
[58:12.040 --> 58:16.320]  dad now that's the double thing you know dad but here's the quote right here
[58:16.320 --> 58:21.480]  dad might have gotten a rib broken which if defibrillator doesn't do if you ever
[58:21.480 --> 58:27.240]  got resuscitated so to be nice to him case he broke a rib we said don't save
[58:27.240 --> 58:32.920]  him killing to saving that's new world order logic and again they do overdo it
[58:32.920 --> 58:37.000]  sometimes hospitals do but that's up to the individual it's their money but once
[58:37.000 --> 58:41.880]  they socialize things they can say well you're paying for it too so now none of
[58:41.880 --> 58:47.320]  you get any care and again you pay more for water get less pay more for power get
[58:47.320 --> 58:51.520]  less pay more for your house get less pay more for your car get less that's the
[58:51.520 --> 58:56.120]  globalist post-industrial model they don't want you being wealthy the
[58:56.120 --> 58:59.120]  globalist talk endlessly in their financial papers that are even published
[58:59.120 --> 59:04.480]  that their trouble is keeping the economy shut down saying the middle class that
[59:04.480 --> 59:09.960]  buy cars or houses are bad no no that's what keeps the entire economy going yeah
[59:09.960 --> 59:14.200]  kill granny get a cash bonus that's not just time magazine coming out with us
[59:14.200 --> 59:18.840]  we actually have a graphic here that shows the case for killing granny how
[59:18.840 --> 59:23.800]  great it is to unplug them and again they want the death panels that's what
[59:23.800 --> 59:30.280]  bill gates talks about in fact we have a video clip of bill gates talking about
[59:30.280 --> 59:35.320]  this but in time magazine they talk about again unplugging grandma but they
[59:35.320 --> 59:41.120]  also in this article they get newsweek is the case for killing granny we're
[59:41.120 --> 59:45.480]  teleprompter freeze up to keep all this in my mind time magazine is you know how
[59:45.480 --> 59:52.440]  to die and in this report he says my parents died serenely with dignity when
[59:52.440 --> 59:58.360]  you are a death panel that is the very best you can hope for so again they
[59:58.360 --> 1:00:01.560]  said the death panels didn't exist but now they're saying they're super trendy
[1:00:01.560 --> 1:00:05.960]  and super cool and the doctors will get bonuses for dispatching you unless you're
[1:00:05.960 --> 1:00:10.400]  an elitist globalist just like over in England where the elitist all get
[1:00:10.400 --> 1:00:14.400]  private doctors everybody else oh we've got a brain surgery that's a hundred
[1:00:14.400 --> 1:00:17.480]  percent operable if it's done within a month you're gonna wait 18 months and
[1:00:17.480 --> 1:00:22.200]  die you understand that's how this works and they don't want you to be able to
[1:00:22.200 --> 1:00:25.880]  medically travel somewhere else and get the health care they're moving to block
[1:00:25.880 --> 1:00:29.720]  that this is the medical tyranny this is how it always starts let's go ahead and
[1:00:29.720 --> 1:00:33.400]  go to this bill gates clip here it is that's a trade-off societies making
[1:00:33.400 --> 1:00:39.680]  because of very very high medical costs and a lack of willingness to say you
[1:00:39.680 --> 1:00:43.000]  know is spending a million dollars on that last three months of life for that
[1:00:43.000 --> 1:00:50.080]  patient would it be better not to lay off the those 10 teachers and to make that
[1:00:50.080 --> 1:00:53.960]  trade-off in medical costs but that's called the death panel and you're not
[1:00:53.960 --> 1:00:58.760]  supposed to have that discussion so you of course that's an interesting thing you
[1:00:58.760 --> 1:01:03.120]  just said which is just the last three months in life for one person something
[1:01:03.120 --> 1:01:07.920]  because we haven't had a discussion of how to allocate that money it means we
[1:01:07.920 --> 1:01:12.840]  lay off three teachers to do so I mean in other words we haven't had this
[1:01:12.840 --> 1:01:17.960]  type of allocation we're making that trade-off because of huge medical costs
[1:01:17.960 --> 1:01:22.520]  that are not examined to see which ones actually have no that's enough so ever
[1:01:22.520 --> 1:01:26.960]  way and because of full reports up to a man dot video and of course that's all
[1:01:26.960 --> 1:01:32.400]  I he wants control of who gets what in a technocracy and they decide who lives
[1:01:32.400 --> 1:01:36.560]  and who dies and it's all just made up crap and he applies numbers to all of
[1:01:36.560 --> 1:01:40.840]  it and then sets himself up as God over you and your family it's it's absolutely
[1:01:40.840 --> 1:01:43.960]  chilling it's the Renaissance and Christianity that produced all this
[1:01:43.960 --> 1:01:49.920]  wealth because we wanted to be nice and kind barbarism gets rid of all the wealth
[1:01:51.640 --> 1:01:58.240]  the New World Order is a planetary corporate plan for world government but
[1:01:58.240 --> 1:02:04.120]  world government is only the control grid now intermembers of the cult are
[1:02:04.120 --> 1:02:09.040]  told that they are going to transcend and become gods and attain immortality but
[1:02:09.040 --> 1:02:14.440]  the price for that is to carry out the orderly extermination of all carbon-based
[1:02:14.440 --> 1:02:19.560]  line forms that's why they say carbon is bad they are rewriting the entire
[1:02:19.560 --> 1:02:25.120]  genetic code of the planet they are playing God they believe they have been
[1:02:25.120 --> 1:02:30.360]  inspired by interdimensional entities that are giving them advanced technology
[1:02:30.360 --> 1:02:36.000]  to carry out this transformation I know this sounds insane but if you read the
[1:02:36.000 --> 1:02:41.880]  writings of the globalist it's all on record you have been warned you have
[1:02:41.880 --> 1:02:47.680]  been given the information to say no to this plan this is the end of all life on
[1:02:47.680 --> 1:03:07.040]  earth as we know it this is the alien takeover of earth
[1:03:17.680 --> 1:03:24.280]  welcome back I'm your host Alex Jones broadcasting from deep in the heart of
[1:03:24.280 --> 1:03:36.560]  Texas worldwide you know info wars is kind of a Frankenstein operation we
[1:03:36.560 --> 1:03:40.900]  were through a lot of fights and we've been through a lot of wars and we go
[1:03:40.900 --> 1:03:45.760]  with what the truth is and what gets the message out and so our scars are our
[1:03:45.760 --> 1:03:52.320]  strengths we are teenage Frankenstein to quote our good buddy that just brought
[1:03:52.320 --> 1:03:57.160]  us in all right and we can say we're no more mr. nice guy to the globalist we're
[1:03:57.160 --> 1:04:00.400]  not bowing down to them we know that they're not in our best interest they're
[1:04:00.400 --> 1:04:05.640]  coming after all of us to try to enslave us and our families
[1:04:05.640 --> 1:04:09.400]  dr. Steve Pachett it's gonna be joining us at the bottom of the hour to talk
[1:04:09.400 --> 1:04:17.020]  about Steve Bannon and his arrest in New York by the southern district of New
[1:04:17.020 --> 1:04:22.980]  York the long arm of the Democratic Party and the deep state that after Steve
[1:04:22.980 --> 1:04:29.680]  Bannon through Roger Stone under the perjury bus and said that he was their
[1:04:29.680 --> 1:04:34.120]  main pipeline to WikiLeaks and the stone told them they were talking to
[1:04:34.120 --> 1:04:40.560]  WikiLeaks we never did any such thing and Bannon had previously testified to
[1:04:40.560 --> 1:04:44.960]  Congress that Stone had not talked to WikiLeaks or not told him that so he
[1:04:44.960 --> 1:04:49.200]  thought he would grovel to the deep state and be passed over but that has
[1:04:49.200 --> 1:04:56.920]  not happened that is coming up bottom of the hour but right now let's get into
[1:04:56.920 --> 1:05:02.800]  the latest COVID-19 news information that's coming out look at this we can
[1:05:02.800 --> 1:05:07.600]  put it up on screen for folks governor of Maine orders restaurant staff to
[1:05:07.600 --> 1:05:16.760]  work COVID visors like dog cones yes yes I love it they already have the kids
[1:05:16.760 --> 1:05:20.560]  wearing the noodles on their heads there are people in bubbles and in cages to go
[1:05:20.560 --> 1:05:24.240]  to concerts it's all another act of mindlessness and of the authoritarian
[1:05:24.240 --> 1:05:30.240]  communist Chinese that are more deadly than Hitler in history are our
[1:05:30.240 --> 1:05:33.840]  precedent according to Fauci we follow their orders well we should follow
[1:05:33.840 --> 1:05:41.680]  Maine's order we should all wear the cone of shame look at that no amount of
[1:05:41.680 --> 1:05:48.080]  idiocy is enough no amount of moronicness in Wisconsin Democrats are
[1:05:48.080 --> 1:05:51.920]  ordering state employees and others and so is the DNC that when you're in a
[1:05:51.920 --> 1:05:57.600]  conversation over zoom from your home you must wear a mask because you can't
[1:05:57.600 --> 1:06:01.720]  ever see anybody's face and not wearing a mask it might make people think that
[1:06:01.720 --> 1:06:05.520]  the peer pressure isn't working so you're wearing a cone around your head
[1:06:05.520 --> 1:06:10.920]  with a mask of course it's lucky if you just have to wear the mask at home
[1:06:10.920 --> 1:06:18.800]  always more more more meanwhile LA mayor crown COVID-19 dictator making good on
[1:06:18.800 --> 1:06:23.920]  cutting off power to homes and businesses that have people in them but
[1:06:23.920 --> 1:06:29.800]  Governor Newsome and others they can keep operating that's just some of the
[1:06:29.800 --> 1:06:33.840]  news on that front domestic violence cases nearly double in Massachusetts
[1:06:33.840 --> 1:06:40.880]  amid COVID lockdown that's the lockdowns causing it not COVID and it goes on from
[1:06:40.880 --> 1:06:43.120]  there
[1:06:44.360 --> 1:06:50.480]  Sweden's coronavirus expert warns that wearing masks is very dangerous and
[1:06:50.480 --> 1:06:54.520]  doesn't protect you and says that they have the lowest numbers in Europe because
[1:06:54.520 --> 1:06:57.640]  basically it's a hoax
[1:06:58.160 --> 1:07:05.800]  meanwhile we need numbers overwhelmingly so Trump can't steal his way to victory
[1:07:05.800 --> 1:07:09.520]  crooked Hillary still warning about Trump saying he wants to steal the
[1:07:09.520 --> 1:07:14.160]  election when she's the one that's been trying to steal all along but look at
[1:07:14.160 --> 1:07:20.120]  that soulless look on her face she's not home there's only the entity behind the
[1:07:20.120 --> 1:07:23.080]  scenes running it and then coming up next segment I'm gonna get to this
[1:07:23.080 --> 1:07:30.640]  footage passengers revolt as airline removes family who had trouble masking
[1:07:30.640 --> 1:07:38.680]  their two-year-old yes because they say two and up you gotta put a suffocating
[1:07:38.680 --> 1:07:43.680]  mask on them and any mammal will fight to get a mask off its face I mean this is
[1:07:43.680 --> 1:07:50.280]  total child abuse total dehumanization but the cult members love it and they
[1:07:50.280 --> 1:07:54.760]  get off on it and they enjoy it
[1:07:56.240 --> 1:08:04.560]  imagine when Bill Gates releases the real bio weapon now let's go ahead and go
[1:08:04.560 --> 1:08:13.920]  to this little piece this is from MSNBC Donald Trump is far more well-suited be
[1:08:13.920 --> 1:08:18.040]  an info wars host than POTUS here it is
[1:08:18.320 --> 1:08:23.120]  Elise it is an understatement to say Trump's on the low road Trump is like
[1:08:23.120 --> 1:08:27.920]  subterranean way down under where all the pipes are laid underground and to
[1:08:27.920 --> 1:08:34.360]  that point he's wrapping himself around what do you say it who would not queue
[1:08:34.360 --> 1:08:39.920]  and on queue and on loons and he has congratulated a right-wing candidate for
[1:08:39.920 --> 1:08:48.120]  I mean he is so committed now to the dark underbelly the fringes aspects that I
[1:08:48.120 --> 1:08:52.240]  don't see how they think they're enough of those people that they're willing to
[1:08:52.240 --> 1:08:57.160]  roll the dice and repel the kind of independent back at a five five minutes
[1:08:57.160 --> 1:09:05.400]  or five seconds look at this information it's just crazy you can see in that
[1:09:05.400 --> 1:09:14.400]  ladies bookstore there that they're on her it's a little distracting with the
[1:09:14.400 --> 1:09:20.120]  music playing the background guys rolling stones
[1:09:20.120 --> 1:09:27.440]  all right whatever let's just start the whole clip over then I'm I'm sitting
[1:09:27.440 --> 1:09:32.520]  there I'm watching the clip and she's got all these communist books behind her
[1:09:32.520 --> 1:09:38.280]  on top of it it's just absolutely insane let's go back from the start here it
[1:09:38.280 --> 1:09:44.400]  is Elise it is an understatement to say Trump's on the low road Trump is like
[1:09:44.400 --> 1:09:49.240]  subterranean way down under where all the pipes are laid underground and to
[1:09:49.240 --> 1:09:55.640]  that point he's wrapping himself around what do you say it who would not queue
[1:09:55.640 --> 1:10:01.200]  and on queue and on loons and he has congratulated a right-wing candidate for
[1:10:01.200 --> 1:10:09.400]  I mean he is so committed now to the dark underbelly the fringes aspects that I
[1:10:09.400 --> 1:10:13.520]  don't see how they think they're enough of those people that they're willing to
[1:10:13.520 --> 1:10:19.880]  roll the dice and repel the kinds of independent or sort of center-right
[1:10:19.880 --> 1:10:27.560]  voters that they assembled four years ago Donald Trump is far more well-suited
[1:10:27.560 --> 1:10:32.520]  to be an info wars host with Alex Jones than to sit in the office and we see
[1:10:32.520 --> 1:10:39.120]  this constantly and it is so maddening that he has absolutely no respect for
[1:10:39.120 --> 1:10:45.520]  facts and truth and instead would rather embrace conspiratorial loons that
[1:10:45.520 --> 1:10:51.600]  reinforce whatever quack idea goes best with his personal inner narrative and
[1:10:51.600 --> 1:10:57.920]  political advantage at a given time it is distressing to see the GOP embrace
[1:10:57.920 --> 1:11:04.320]  candidates who are QAnon followers and let's just hope that they're in
[1:11:04.320 --> 1:11:08.760]  districts that are so red that there won't be any risk of them actually
[1:11:08.760 --> 1:11:14.080]  gaining political power but it's petrifying that the megaphone of the
[1:11:14.080 --> 1:11:20.160]  Oval Office the president where Harry S. Truman like Eisenhower and Harry S.
[1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:27.720]  Truman and Abraham Lincoln said is being used to propagate these at this
[1:11:27.720 --> 1:11:34.920]  absolute nonsense that is harmful and dangerous to society propagate it's
[1:11:34.920 --> 1:11:39.520]  propagates sweetheart so they said if they're trying to act normal when they
[1:11:39.520 --> 1:11:43.520]  support communist China the end of the country defying the police collapsing
[1:11:43.520 --> 1:11:47.760]  everything and they try to make Alex Jones and Laura Loomer look bad because
[1:11:47.760 --> 1:11:52.000]  they fear us if the public becomes populist if the public recognizes the
[1:11:52.000 --> 1:11:56.200]  UN takeover if the public recognizes it's wrong to censor doctors that talk
[1:11:56.200 --> 1:11:59.720]  about treatments that are working against COVID-19 if we recognize what
[1:11:59.720 --> 1:12:04.880]  authoritarian monsters these individuals are their reign of control over us in
[1:12:04.880 --> 1:12:11.440]  is over but it's going to come down to that point where we stop being afraid
[1:12:11.440 --> 1:12:16.440]  of them calling us a kook or a loon when that show has like a hundred thousand
[1:12:16.440 --> 1:12:21.280]  viewers when that shows a bunch of nobodies and the woman's got all this
[1:12:21.280 --> 1:12:26.040]  authoritarian and communist garbage behind her because she wants you to know
[1:12:26.040 --> 1:12:30.520]  that's who she is let me tell you who's dangerous and on the fringes is a
[1:12:30.520 --> 1:12:35.280]  Shea Guevara that was against black people in Hispanics he thought Mexicans
[1:12:35.280 --> 1:12:42.760]  were horrible he hated black people he sound like a KKK leader Carl Marx all
[1:12:42.760 --> 1:12:48.840]  those guys they're scum you're scum lady not us get out of America go to
[1:12:48.840 --> 1:12:52.240]  North Korea you filthy monster
[1:12:53.840 --> 1:12:58.840]  attention attention attention to anyone that still wants to live in a free
[1:12:58.840 --> 1:13:03.600]  country the New World Order Chai Kham globalist syndicate is making its move
[1:13:03.600 --> 1:13:07.920]  to implode the dollar and thrust the United States into a civil war by
[1:13:07.920 --> 1:13:12.120]  contesting the election they are openly wargaming this at the highest levels of
[1:13:12.120 --> 1:13:16.240]  Democratic Party Nancy Pelosi and others have gone on television and said they
[1:13:16.240 --> 1:13:20.080]  will contest the election Trump is going they will hold a separate
[1:13:20.080 --> 1:13:24.440]  inauguration for Biden and Kamala Harris and that anyone challenging that
[1:13:24.440 --> 1:13:28.360]  will be called a racist they will then trigger race riots and violence they've
[1:13:28.360 --> 1:13:34.120]  already beta tested around the country we are not living in normal times when
[1:13:34.120 --> 1:13:37.320]  these type of things happen in history people are usually caught flat footed
[1:13:37.320 --> 1:13:42.680]  because they can't believe they're living in such a criminal era we are we are
[1:13:42.680 --> 1:13:45.480]  living in the period where this criminal globalist syndicate has been
[1:13:45.480 --> 1:13:49.800]  feeding on America is being exposed and removed now is the time for all good

[1:15:07.960 --> 1:15:14.800]  there's a man coming around taking man's going round taking names everybody
[1:15:14.800 --> 1:15:23.320]  and he decides who to free and who to blame everybody won't be treated all
[1:15:23.320 --> 1:15:31.160]  the same there'll be a golden letter reaching down when the man comes around
[1:15:31.160 --> 1:15:36.040]  when the man comes around and we're not talking about Durham you know I'm not
[1:15:36.040 --> 1:15:41.720]  gonna hold my breath for Durham but they haven't died it of course this FBI
[1:15:41.720 --> 1:15:49.760]  lawyer Klein Smith had falsified an FBI report and sandwiched him with another
[1:15:49.760 --> 1:15:56.440]  report and cut out that of course Carter Page was working for the CIA and
[1:15:56.440 --> 1:16:01.760]  that's why he was talking to Russians and then now after Carter Page testified
[1:16:01.760 --> 1:16:07.520]  to Congress they have new articles outgoing Carter Page wouldn't say what
[1:16:07.520 --> 1:16:13.080]  he was doing in Moscow and beat around the bush because it's classified so you
[1:16:13.080 --> 1:16:17.200]  think about how cheap Obama was he couldn't find one American selling us
[1:16:17.200 --> 1:16:20.920]  out to the Russians they admit thousands of people contacted by the FBI
[1:16:20.920 --> 1:16:27.200]  investigation no one sold anybody up so they had to go out for a CIA agent who
[1:16:27.200 --> 1:16:32.920]  was over there doing his job in Russia and say oh look he talked to Russians
[1:16:32.920 --> 1:16:39.040]  he's guilty meanwhile the Democratic Party is literally on its knees before
[1:16:39.040 --> 1:16:42.920]  the Communist Chinese and being endorsed by the Communist Chinese and say the
[1:16:42.920 --> 1:16:49.520]  Communist Chinese should run America that's why they always say I'm a Russian
[1:16:49.520 --> 1:16:54.120]  agent Trump's a Russian agent his voters are Russian doves because they're
[1:16:54.120 --> 1:16:57.080]  enemies of America folks and what do you do when you're an enemy bringing the
[1:16:57.080 --> 1:17:03.400]  country down you accuse the loyal Americans of being the enemy but you
[1:17:03.400 --> 1:17:10.400]  don't want to point when your spiritual road killed like Pelosi and a real
[1:17:10.400 --> 1:17:16.240]  enemy like China so you point at Russia it's at the very same satanic globalist
[1:17:16.240 --> 1:17:20.520]  hunched over it for 100 years trying to rape the daylights out of it and just
[1:17:20.520 --> 1:17:27.200]  pissed that Russia crawled away halfway and got the New World Order proboscis out
[1:17:27.200 --> 1:17:29.680]  of their back
[1:17:33.200 --> 1:17:37.480]  so now they got us wearing masks and saying oh you can't go to college you
[1:17:37.480 --> 1:17:40.800]  can't leave the college for the semester you got to have a tracking app on your
[1:17:40.800 --> 1:17:44.920]  phone and we're gonna take your kids away it's just never gonna end and first
[1:17:44.920 --> 1:17:49.400]  was oh kids under six don't have to wear a mask oh kids two and up so people are
[1:17:49.400 --> 1:17:53.000]  trying to muzzle two-year-olds when any natural mammal trying to put some words
[1:17:53.000 --> 1:17:58.240]  face it can't breathe don't pull it off so let's start from the beginning here's
[1:17:58.240 --> 1:18:02.800]  this good little stewardess throwing the woman off for her two-year-old and the
[1:18:02.800 --> 1:18:07.400]  baby that's jet blue that's the airlines that's our submission that's who we are
[1:18:07.400 --> 1:18:11.240]  that's the virtue signaling as if wearing masks on airplanes does
[1:18:11.240 --> 1:18:27.480]  anything start the video
[1:18:27.480 --> 1:18:30.800]  and she's trying to make the mother show her baby
[1:18:30.800 --> 1:18:41.940]  right
[1:18:42.360 --> 1:18:46.800]  why are you saying on your website
[1:18:50.600 --> 1:18:56.560]  law
[1:18:56.560 --> 1:18:59.560]  Let's get out of there and let's get this to the room.
[1:18:59.560 --> 1:19:01.560]  At least this crowded chair when she chose what went on.
[1:19:01.560 --> 1:19:02.560]  Leave her alone.
[1:19:02.560 --> 1:19:03.560]  Leave her alone.
[1:19:03.560 --> 1:19:04.560]  Leave her alone.
[1:19:04.560 --> 1:19:05.560]  Leave her alone.
[1:19:05.560 --> 1:19:07.560]  Because he was fucking with me when I got on a plane with Roman.
[1:19:07.560 --> 1:19:08.560]  Him too.
[1:19:08.560 --> 1:19:11.560]  Talking about Roman guy.
[1:19:11.560 --> 1:19:13.560]  Passengers revolt.
[1:19:13.560 --> 1:19:16.560]  This airline removes family who had trouble masking.
[1:19:16.560 --> 1:19:17.560]  What a cult.
[1:19:17.560 --> 1:19:18.560]  Two year old.
[1:19:18.560 --> 1:19:21.560]  That little girl's learning how to live on a sherry edge.
[1:19:21.560 --> 1:19:25.560]  I think everybody in this plane took a plane about this.
[1:19:25.560 --> 1:19:27.560]  I should have put up with it, folks.
[1:19:27.560 --> 1:19:29.560]  Because nexus come in the contact tracing.
[1:19:29.560 --> 1:19:30.560]  Inplanable chips.
[1:19:30.560 --> 1:19:31.560]  The force inoculations.
[1:19:31.560 --> 1:19:33.560]  In fact, it's already here in Australia.
[1:19:33.560 --> 1:19:35.560]  Under the United Nations.
[1:19:35.560 --> 1:19:38.560]  Let's look at some more globalist insanity.
[1:19:38.560 --> 1:19:41.560]  Saw this article on CNN today.
[1:19:41.560 --> 1:19:50.560]  HaShim Abdadi, brother of Adrian Grande, concert bomber,
[1:19:50.560 --> 1:19:53.560]  says a 55 years in prison.
[1:19:53.560 --> 1:19:57.560]  If you read this article, none of it's how they did it for Islam.
[1:19:57.560 --> 1:20:02.560]  Can you imagine if a white Christian bombed a concert
[1:20:02.560 --> 1:20:08.560]  blowing up a bunch of prepubescent teenage girls.
[1:20:08.560 --> 1:20:10.560]  It would be the end of the world.
[1:20:10.560 --> 1:20:12.560]  Every Christian would be at fault.
[1:20:12.560 --> 1:20:14.560]  The Pope would apologize.
[1:20:14.560 --> 1:20:16.560]  Churches might be pulled down.
[1:20:16.560 --> 1:20:18.560]  Crosses might be removed.
[1:20:18.560 --> 1:20:21.560]  But man, when there's the truck of peace running people over,
[1:20:21.560 --> 1:20:23.560]  or there's Islamic mass bombings or shootings,
[1:20:23.560 --> 1:20:27.560]  or attacks on Christmas,
[1:20:27.560 --> 1:20:29.560]  outdoor displays,
[1:20:29.560 --> 1:20:33.560]  you never hear it's an Allah Akbar.
[1:20:33.560 --> 1:20:35.560]  Of course, there's not many churches in the Middle East.
[1:20:35.560 --> 1:20:37.560]  They've all been bombed out of existence.
[1:20:37.560 --> 1:20:39.560]  So you take this guy in.
[1:20:39.560 --> 1:20:44.560]  His family were migrants, invaders.
[1:20:44.560 --> 1:20:47.560]  And he comes in with the lazy eyes.
[1:20:47.560 --> 1:20:50.560]  And he comes in and gets on welfare with his brother.
[1:20:50.560 --> 1:20:54.560]  And then he blows you up.
[1:20:54.560 --> 1:20:59.560]  And it's okay.
[1:20:59.560 --> 1:21:04.560]  It's okay because, you know, they're white kids.
[1:21:04.560 --> 1:21:07.560]  And they're Christian.
[1:21:07.560 --> 1:21:09.560]  So you blow them up.
[1:21:09.560 --> 1:21:12.560]  And when we would try to point out he and his brother were Islamists
[1:21:12.560 --> 1:21:14.560]  and took credit for it in Islamist's ways.
[1:21:14.560 --> 1:21:16.560]  We got censored.
[1:21:16.560 --> 1:21:20.560]  What was that, like four years ago when that happened?
[1:21:20.560 --> 1:21:23.560]  Yeah, 2017, almost four years ago.
[1:21:23.560 --> 1:21:25.560]  May 2017.
[1:21:25.560 --> 1:21:28.560]  I said this, 17, 18, 19, 20, huh?
[1:21:28.560 --> 1:21:31.560]  Four years ago.
[1:21:31.560 --> 1:21:33.560]  And I remember getting censored.
[1:21:33.560 --> 1:21:35.560]  They said, you don't say that's Islamic.
[1:21:35.560 --> 1:21:38.560]  No.
[1:21:38.560 --> 1:21:42.560]  Look at this, dude.
[1:21:42.560 --> 1:21:45.560]  I mean, what's up with that, dude?
[1:21:45.560 --> 1:21:47.560]  It's called imbreding, folks.
[1:21:47.560 --> 1:21:49.560]  And it causes psychotic behavior.
[1:21:49.560 --> 1:21:51.560]  You can be white, you can be brown and imbred,
[1:21:51.560 --> 1:21:54.560]  and you're going to have a problem in a lot of Muslim countries.
[1:21:54.560 --> 1:21:56.560]  Like Pakistan, a lot of great people from Pakistan,
[1:21:56.560 --> 1:22:00.560]  but a lot where, you know, you've got,
[1:22:00.560 --> 1:22:03.560]  Pakistanis aren't even 1% of the population in the UK,
[1:22:03.560 --> 1:22:06.560]  and almost 40% of Burk defects are Pakistanis.
[1:22:06.560 --> 1:22:11.560]  Very, very sad.
[1:22:11.560 --> 1:22:16.560]  But, you know, they don't feel welcomed into the culture,
[1:22:16.560 --> 1:22:20.560]  and so they blow up the culture.
[1:22:20.560 --> 1:22:22.560]  You know, they don't, the left doesn't leave California
[1:22:22.560 --> 1:22:24.560]  and come to your state and stop it.
[1:22:24.560 --> 1:22:27.560]  They come and they bring California.
[1:22:27.560 --> 1:22:31.560]  And Islam doesn't leave Islam and then come here
[1:22:31.560 --> 1:22:32.560]  and want to be us.
[1:22:32.560 --> 1:22:33.560]  No, no, no.
[1:22:33.560 --> 1:22:37.560]  On average, they're disgusted with who we are.
[1:22:37.560 --> 1:22:39.560]  And I mean, I'm disgusted with who we are,
[1:22:39.560 --> 1:22:42.560]  and I don't want to blow people up.
[1:22:42.560 --> 1:22:45.560]  And they do not embrace us.
[1:22:45.560 --> 1:22:48.560]  So another big taboo, but it's okay though,
[1:22:48.560 --> 1:22:51.560]  because the governor of Maine says you got to wear
[1:22:51.560 --> 1:22:53.560]  literal cones of shame.
[1:22:53.560 --> 1:22:55.560]  And you know, he got paid by Think Tech to do this
[1:22:55.560 --> 1:22:59.560]  just to see how much stupid stuff they can make you do.
[1:22:59.560 --> 1:23:02.560]  That's all this is.
[1:23:02.560 --> 1:23:04.560]  And now, what was a couple weeks ago,
[1:23:04.560 --> 1:23:08.560]  a major Indian Hindu group
[1:23:08.560 --> 1:23:12.560]  in the yearly celebration they've had for hundreds of years
[1:23:12.560 --> 1:23:15.560]  to remember a Hindu shrine taken by Muslims.
[1:23:15.560 --> 1:23:18.560]  Because you know, Indian Hindus used to be all the way
[1:23:18.560 --> 1:23:20.560]  into Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan.
[1:23:20.560 --> 1:23:21.560]  That was all Hindu.
[1:23:21.560 --> 1:23:22.560]  It's all Buddhist.
[1:23:22.560 --> 1:23:24.560]  And then all the way into China.
[1:23:24.560 --> 1:23:26.560]  Now they're just Indian.
[1:23:26.560 --> 1:23:27.560]  And that's being overthrown.
[1:23:27.560 --> 1:23:31.560]  So the Indians Facebook a bunch of them banned them
[1:23:31.560 --> 1:23:33.560]  and said, you're not allowed to have your worship
[1:23:33.560 --> 1:23:35.560]  of your Hindu God and your shrine
[1:23:35.560 --> 1:23:37.560]  because that hurts the Muslims' feelings.
[1:23:37.560 --> 1:23:44.560]  So Hindus aren't even allowed to worship their saint.
[1:23:44.560 --> 1:23:46.560]  They're not even allowed to do that
[1:23:46.560 --> 1:23:48.560]  because the Muslims say, we took your land,
[1:23:48.560 --> 1:23:50.560]  we have that shrine.
[1:23:50.560 --> 1:23:52.560]  So because we captured it, you can't talk about it.
[1:23:52.560 --> 1:23:55.560]  The social engineers bet on you not having a memory
[1:23:55.560 --> 1:23:56.560]  more than anything.
[1:23:56.560 --> 1:23:57.560]  And they also bet,
[1:23:57.560 --> 1:23:59.560]  because they constantly talk about it in their own words,
[1:23:59.560 --> 1:24:01.560]  that you will adapt to being a slave,
[1:24:01.560 --> 1:24:04.560]  that you will learn incrementally to submit.
[1:24:04.560 --> 1:24:08.560]  So think about and remember the phases of the Fauci fraud.
[1:24:08.560 --> 1:24:11.560]  Remember that everything he said has been a premeditated lie.
[1:24:11.560 --> 1:24:13.560]  They lied about where it came from.
[1:24:13.560 --> 1:24:15.560]  They lied about person to person.
[1:24:15.560 --> 1:24:17.560]  The UN covered it all up.
[1:24:17.560 --> 1:24:19.560]  Then exaggerated the death rate at 4%.
[1:24:19.560 --> 1:24:24.560]  But it's actually 0.032 now and dropping.
[1:24:24.560 --> 1:24:28.560]  Then they set the test up to count almost all false positives.
[1:24:28.560 --> 1:24:30.560]  They put the names of people that died of other diseases
[1:24:30.560 --> 1:24:32.560]  in the COVID column.
[1:24:32.560 --> 1:24:34.560]  They only said there'd be a 15-day lockdown.
[1:24:34.560 --> 1:24:35.560]  Now we're six months later.
[1:24:35.560 --> 1:24:37.560]  Now they say it's permanent.
[1:24:37.560 --> 1:24:38.560]  You've got to wear a mask forever.
[1:24:38.560 --> 1:24:40.560]  And forced inoculations are coming.
[1:24:40.560 --> 1:24:41.560]  And they're going to track everywhere you go
[1:24:41.560 --> 1:24:43.560]  with what you do, the global social credit score.
[1:24:43.560 --> 1:24:44.560]  And the UN is the boss.
[1:24:44.560 --> 1:24:48.560]  Anybody questioning it is censored off the internet loses their job.
[1:24:48.560 --> 1:24:50.560]  That's called 21st century tyranny.
[1:24:50.560 --> 1:24:52.560]  That's called world government takeover.
[1:24:52.560 --> 1:24:54.560]  Constantly, whether it's the New York Times,
[1:24:54.560 --> 1:24:56.560]  the Washington Post, or Howard Stern,
[1:24:56.560 --> 1:24:57.560]  of a blue name,
[1:24:57.560 --> 1:24:59.560]  and they come out and they attack him full war saying,
[1:24:59.560 --> 1:25:02.560]  Jones claims civil war is coming.
[1:25:02.560 --> 1:25:06.560]  And financial collapse and planetary lockdowns using viruses.
[1:25:06.560 --> 1:25:08.560]  And he tells people they should get off the grid
[1:25:08.560 --> 1:25:12.560]  and get prepared and have storeable food if they can.
[1:25:12.560 --> 1:25:15.560]  And now everything I've warned people about is coming true
[1:25:15.560 --> 1:25:18.560]  because it was all in the Rockefeller Foundation documents
[1:25:18.560 --> 1:25:19.560]  like lockstep.
[1:25:19.560 --> 1:25:22.560]  This is the corporate planetary takeover.
[1:25:22.560 --> 1:25:25.560]  So yes, I stand by what I said 10 years ago,
[1:25:25.560 --> 1:25:26.560]  what I said a year ago,
[1:25:26.560 --> 1:25:28.560]  and what I said last week more than ever.

[1:26:55.560 --> 1:27:12.560]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:27:12.560 --> 1:27:13.560]  Big brother.
[1:27:13.560 --> 1:27:15.560]  Mainstream media.
[1:27:15.560 --> 1:27:17.560]  Government cover-ups.
[1:27:17.560 --> 1:27:19.560]  You want to stop tyranny?
[1:27:19.560 --> 1:27:20.560]  Well so does he.
[1:27:20.560 --> 1:27:25.560]  Live from Austin, Texas, broadcasting worldwide.
[1:27:25.560 --> 1:27:31.560]  It's Alex Jones.
[1:27:31.560 --> 1:27:35.560]  This morning at about 8.30 I was thinking I need to call two people,
[1:27:35.560 --> 1:27:38.560]  Roger Stone and Dr. Steve Pacinic.
[1:27:38.560 --> 1:27:40.560]  Roger Stone is so exhausted he's taking most of the day off
[1:27:40.560 --> 1:27:43.560]  he said it'll come on tomorrow.
[1:27:43.560 --> 1:27:45.560]  And I was about to call a producer, Gary,
[1:27:45.560 --> 1:27:47.560]  and say get Steve Pacinic on and here comes the message.
[1:27:47.560 --> 1:27:49.560]  Hey, Steve Pacinic wants to come on
[1:27:49.560 --> 1:27:52.560]  because I know he's got a lot of inside baseball on Steve Bannon.
[1:27:52.560 --> 1:27:54.560]  I don't know his take yet, but I'm going to give you a mine.
[1:27:54.560 --> 1:27:55.560]  We'll see how they match up.
[1:27:55.560 --> 1:27:57.560]  It's kind of a fun game.
[1:27:57.560 --> 1:27:59.560]  I don't like Steve Bannon.
[1:27:59.560 --> 1:28:02.560]  Steve Bannon brought in a bunch of the deep state globalists.
[1:28:02.560 --> 1:28:04.560]  He basically is a Hollywood screenwriter
[1:28:04.560 --> 1:28:08.560]  and he took a lot of the populist movement that was already out there
[1:28:08.560 --> 1:28:10.560]  that this audience supported
[1:28:10.560 --> 1:28:12.560]  and kind of cobbled together as an operating system.
[1:28:12.560 --> 1:28:15.560]  Trump resonated with it along with Stephen Miller.
[1:28:15.560 --> 1:28:17.560]  I think he's a good guy and Trump really believes it,
[1:28:17.560 --> 1:28:21.560]  but then Bannon lied in the Senate Committee,
[1:28:21.560 --> 1:28:23.560]  Intelligence Committee, and said that,
[1:28:23.560 --> 1:28:25.560]  well, Stone had no connections with WikiLeaks.
[1:28:25.560 --> 1:28:26.560]  Well, that was the truth.
[1:28:26.560 --> 1:28:32.560]  But then he went and lied with the perjury to the show trial
[1:28:32.560 --> 1:28:37.560]  in D.C. against Roger Stone with Judge Amy Berman Jackson
[1:28:37.560 --> 1:28:39.560]  and said that he was the main conduit.
[1:28:39.560 --> 1:28:41.560]  Well, I was there. There was no conduit.
[1:28:41.560 --> 1:28:44.560]  And so I see him indicted in Southern District of New York
[1:28:44.560 --> 1:28:49.560]  for supposedly skimming money off of the private wall.
[1:28:49.560 --> 1:28:51.560]  And I see them doing the same tactic against the NRA.
[1:28:51.560 --> 1:28:54.560]  And it looks like the Democrats just trying to make
[1:28:54.560 --> 1:28:56.560]  Republican or conservative fundraising
[1:28:56.560 --> 1:28:58.560]  and grassroots organizations illegal.
[1:28:58.560 --> 1:29:00.560]  So I don't like the fact he's been indicted.
[1:29:00.560 --> 1:29:02.560]  I want to see Bill Clinton indicted.
[1:29:02.560 --> 1:29:04.560]  I want to see the deep state in trouble
[1:29:04.560 --> 1:29:06.560]  for all the things they've done.
[1:29:06.560 --> 1:29:09.560]  But at the same time, he went and perjured himself
[1:29:09.560 --> 1:29:10.560]  against Roger Stone.
[1:29:10.560 --> 1:29:11.560]  He worked with Epstein.
[1:29:11.560 --> 1:29:13.560]  He did all these crooked, dirty things.
[1:29:13.560 --> 1:29:14.560]  So I'm not crying about it.
[1:29:14.560 --> 1:29:17.560]  But at the same time, I rarely have mixed feelings about something.
[1:29:17.560 --> 1:29:18.560]  It's a complex issue.
[1:29:18.560 --> 1:29:20.560]  But I bet Dr. Steve Pachennick,
[1:29:20.560 --> 1:29:22.560]  former head of psychological warfare operations
[1:29:22.560 --> 1:29:23.560]  in the State Department,
[1:29:23.560 --> 1:29:25.560]  works for a lot of big agencies in the Pentagon,
[1:29:25.560 --> 1:29:27.560]  you name it, helped do regime change, bestselling author,
[1:29:27.560 --> 1:29:29.560]  co-author of many books with Tom Clancy,
[1:29:29.560 --> 1:29:31.560]  and a psychiatrist and so much more.
[1:29:31.560 --> 1:29:33.560]  What is your take on this?
[1:29:33.560 --> 1:29:35.560]  It's very simple.
[1:29:35.560 --> 1:29:37.560]  I was on your show a couple of months ago,
[1:29:37.560 --> 1:29:42.560]  and I said that Steve Danon was a complete sociopath.
[1:29:42.560 --> 1:29:46.560]  And eventually, he would trap himself in his lies
[1:29:46.560 --> 1:29:50.560]  and his collusions with his colleagues.
[1:29:50.560 --> 1:29:54.560]  I am for the indictment, conviction, and prison
[1:29:54.560 --> 1:29:56.560]  for Steve Danon.
[1:29:56.560 --> 1:29:58.560]  The reason is very simple.
[1:29:58.560 --> 1:30:01.560]  Danon is what we call a self-promoter.
[1:30:01.560 --> 1:30:06.560]  A nicer term or a different term would be a BS artist.
[1:30:06.560 --> 1:30:09.560]  The technical term is he is a complete sociopath.
[1:30:09.560 --> 1:30:12.560]  From the day he created his own background
[1:30:12.560 --> 1:30:16.560]  to the day he pretended he was an intelligence operative
[1:30:16.560 --> 1:30:19.560]  or he was a man who understood national security,
[1:30:19.560 --> 1:30:23.560]  there wasn't one iota of truth in his statements
[1:30:23.560 --> 1:30:25.560]  or in his being.
[1:30:25.560 --> 1:30:29.560]  The truth of the matter is he was highly self-destructive.
[1:30:29.560 --> 1:30:31.560]  Like all narcissists,
[1:30:31.560 --> 1:30:34.560]  he eventually ingratiated himself with Trump,
[1:30:34.560 --> 1:30:36.560]  got into the inner circle,
[1:30:36.560 --> 1:30:40.560]  and what does he do? He then goes out and talks to Wolf,
[1:30:40.560 --> 1:30:43.560]  who writes fast and furious,
[1:30:43.560 --> 1:30:47.560]  and explains how Ivanka Trump is dumb as a brick.
[1:30:47.560 --> 1:30:51.560]  Jared Kushner is as crooked as a day as long,
[1:30:51.560 --> 1:30:54.560]  and that Trump himself is not a billionaire,
[1:30:54.560 --> 1:30:57.560]  but a millionaire who is going to be eventually indicted.
[1:30:57.560 --> 1:31:00.560]  Welcome to the world of Trump.
[1:31:00.560 --> 1:31:02.560]  I warned Trump about Bolton.
[1:31:02.560 --> 1:31:04.560]  I warned Trump about Fauci.
[1:31:04.560 --> 1:31:07.560]  I had warned Trump about Bannon.
[1:31:07.560 --> 1:31:11.560]  This is an exercise in kind of futility
[1:31:11.560 --> 1:31:16.560]  and basically a trapment of self-aggrandizement.
[1:31:16.560 --> 1:31:18.560]  Roger Stone is a different issue.
[1:31:18.560 --> 1:31:22.560]  He has nothing to do with Bannon in terms of what I believe.
[1:31:22.560 --> 1:31:24.560]  Roger is innocent.
[1:31:24.560 --> 1:31:26.560]  You don't put him in jail.
[1:31:26.560 --> 1:31:28.560]  Roger has been around 30, 40 years
[1:31:28.560 --> 1:31:30.560]  since the Nixon administration,
[1:31:30.560 --> 1:31:35.560]  but Roger never doubled doubt Nixon or Trump.
[1:31:35.560 --> 1:31:39.560]  He never spoke badly about either one.
[1:31:39.560 --> 1:31:42.560]  He never revealed anything in a book
[1:31:42.560 --> 1:31:44.560]  concerning the life of Trump.
[1:31:44.560 --> 1:31:46.560]  Oh, you're right. He is completely neurotic
[1:31:46.560 --> 1:31:48.560]  about never using his knowledge
[1:31:48.560 --> 1:31:50.560]  against anybody that he's been in league with.
[1:31:50.560 --> 1:31:51.560]  Very loyal.
[1:31:51.560 --> 1:31:53.560]  Roger was extremely loyal.
[1:31:53.560 --> 1:31:57.560]  You don't paint a picture of Nixon on your back,
[1:31:57.560 --> 1:31:58.560]  and he was silent.
[1:31:58.560 --> 1:32:02.560]  There was basically no penalty or an issue.
[1:32:02.560 --> 1:32:05.560]  This is a totally different consideration, my friend.
[1:32:05.560 --> 1:32:09.560]  This consideration is about people like Sean Hannity
[1:32:09.560 --> 1:32:12.560]  who just came out and said that Trump is nuts.
[1:32:12.560 --> 1:32:15.560]  He's basically a child. He's crazy.
[1:32:15.560 --> 1:32:17.560]  And what I'm getting at,
[1:32:17.560 --> 1:32:19.560]  unlike the Roger Stones and unlike others
[1:32:19.560 --> 1:32:23.560]  who really believed in Trump as a viable candidate,
[1:32:23.560 --> 1:32:25.560]  what you have are the individuals
[1:32:25.560 --> 1:32:28.560]  who ingratiate themselves,
[1:32:28.560 --> 1:32:30.560]  either because they want the top news story
[1:32:30.560 --> 1:32:32.560]  like Sean Hannity, who's going to go next,
[1:32:32.560 --> 1:32:34.560]  he's going to get fired,
[1:32:34.560 --> 1:32:37.560]  or the Steve Bannon's who create their own persona,
[1:32:37.560 --> 1:32:39.560]  make believe they love the middle class,
[1:32:39.560 --> 1:32:43.560]  and then they basically rob the middle class.
[1:32:43.560 --> 1:32:45.560]  This whole thing is a felony,
[1:32:45.560 --> 1:32:48.560]  and I hope Steve Bannon goes to prison for it.
[1:32:48.560 --> 1:32:52.560]  He created a whole background scenario which wasn't valid.
[1:32:52.560 --> 1:32:57.560]  It was filled with all kinds of lies, distortion, and corruption.
[1:32:57.560 --> 1:33:00.560]  When he made the movies in Hollywood, they were horrendous.
[1:33:00.560 --> 1:33:03.560]  He skimmed off a lot of other areas.
[1:33:03.560 --> 1:33:05.560]  I don't want to go into the specifics.
[1:33:05.560 --> 1:33:06.560]  Well, that's what I've been told.
[1:33:06.560 --> 1:33:08.560]  He's known in L.A. everywhere as a con man,
[1:33:08.560 --> 1:33:10.560]  and I just didn't want to attack him early on,
[1:33:10.560 --> 1:33:13.560]  but then I learned that he was the guy that brought in.
[1:33:13.560 --> 1:33:16.560]  That's what Roger said, all these bad globalists.
[1:33:16.560 --> 1:33:18.560]  Well, it's not only he brought in the globalists.
[1:33:18.560 --> 1:33:21.560]  He is a con man. Forget anything else.
[1:33:21.560 --> 1:33:23.560]  He is a man who goes in there,
[1:33:23.560 --> 1:33:25.560]  praises the president,
[1:33:25.560 --> 1:33:29.560]  basically tries to make himself more important than he is,
[1:33:29.560 --> 1:33:32.560]  turns around, and at the same time
[1:33:32.560 --> 1:33:35.560]  will ingratiate himself with the Washington press
[1:33:35.560 --> 1:33:38.560]  and say, look, I've got a crazy guy here.
[1:33:38.560 --> 1:33:40.560]  I know how to manipulate him. I know what to do.
[1:33:40.560 --> 1:33:44.560]  Oh, by the way, Jared Kushner is my competitor,
[1:33:44.560 --> 1:33:46.560]  and the only one I've got a problem with.
[1:33:46.560 --> 1:33:48.560]  But you know those Jews, they're crooked,
[1:33:48.560 --> 1:33:51.560]  and you know damn well that he's going to go to prison.
[1:33:51.560 --> 1:33:54.560]  Oh, by the way, Ivanka, who married that Jew,
[1:33:54.560 --> 1:33:56.560]  is as dumb as a brick.
[1:33:56.560 --> 1:33:58.560]  So you're saying the whole original narrative
[1:33:58.560 --> 1:34:00.560]  of getting rid of Trump's wives credibility-wise
[1:34:00.560 --> 1:34:01.560]  and everybody?
[1:34:01.560 --> 1:34:03.560]  Because I always heard that was actually Bannon.
[1:34:03.560 --> 1:34:05.560]  That's why the media built Bannon up,
[1:34:05.560 --> 1:34:06.560]  that he was bigger than Trump,
[1:34:06.560 --> 1:34:09.560]  was because they wanted his credibility to be so high.
[1:34:09.560 --> 1:34:11.560]  Well, it's not only the media built it up,
[1:34:11.560 --> 1:34:14.560]  Bannon built it for himself as...
[1:34:14.560 --> 1:34:17.560]  This is the classical sociopath.
[1:34:17.560 --> 1:34:20.560]  They self-aggrandized, and then they self-destruct.
[1:34:20.560 --> 1:34:23.560]  Mao Tse-tung had a term for this.
[1:34:23.560 --> 1:34:26.560]  The higher the monkey goes, the further he falls.
[1:34:26.560 --> 1:34:30.560]  This monkey was Steve Bannon, and he's going to prison.
[1:34:30.560 --> 1:34:32.560]  Because I'll tell you one thing.
[1:34:32.560 --> 1:34:36.560]  You can play with Trump. You can think you manipulate Trump.
[1:34:36.560 --> 1:34:39.560]  You can say all you want about Elon Musk being an idiot
[1:34:39.560 --> 1:34:43.560]  or stupid or a man-child, which is what Bannon did.
[1:34:43.560 --> 1:34:47.560]  But the truth of the matter is Musk has created rockets
[1:34:47.560 --> 1:34:50.560]  that went into space. He created Tesla.
[1:34:50.560 --> 1:34:53.560]  And guess what? Trump built buildings.
[1:34:53.560 --> 1:34:56.560]  Well, let's be clear, too. They kept saying his rockets would fail.
[1:34:56.560 --> 1:34:58.560]  They're performing better than the Russian rockets
[1:34:58.560 --> 1:35:01.560]  and better than Vernevon-Bronze for much lower prices
[1:35:01.560 --> 1:35:02.560]  compared to their time.
[1:35:02.560 --> 1:35:05.560]  So he's really as proven in Spain as he's the real deal.
[1:35:05.560 --> 1:35:09.560]  Exactly. For the first time over, since for 11 years,
[1:35:09.560 --> 1:35:12.560]  we're going into space on an American rocket
[1:35:12.560 --> 1:35:16.560]  with American pilots going out of an American base.
[1:35:16.560 --> 1:35:18.560]  That's 11 years we haven't done that.
[1:35:18.560 --> 1:35:20.560]  Obama couldn't do that.
[1:35:20.560 --> 1:35:24.560]  Then we have people like Colin Powell, another sociopath,
[1:35:24.560 --> 1:35:27.560]  a pervericator who says that Biden, again,
[1:35:27.560 --> 1:35:31.560]  a senile, demented liar and corrupt individual,
[1:35:31.560 --> 1:35:34.560]  it can bring the whole country together.
[1:35:34.560 --> 1:35:35.560]  So what you see...
[1:35:35.560 --> 1:35:36.560]  I'll go back to this American thing.
[1:35:36.560 --> 1:35:38.560]  Even though he's from South Africa, he's becoming American.
[1:35:38.560 --> 1:35:40.560]  He bet everything, his fortunes, everything,
[1:35:40.560 --> 1:35:42.560]  and then succeeded.
[1:35:42.560 --> 1:35:44.560]  Even if he failed, that would be an American trait.
[1:35:44.560 --> 1:35:45.560]  But you're right.
[1:35:45.560 --> 1:35:48.560]  I mean, I admire Elon Musk for all the things he's doing.
[1:35:48.560 --> 1:35:51.560]  I had property in South Africa.
[1:35:51.560 --> 1:35:53.560]  I worked with the South Africans.
[1:35:53.560 --> 1:35:56.560]  I had property in Stelenbosch, which is a great area.
[1:35:56.560 --> 1:36:00.560]  The Afrikaans, the whites who built out South Africa,
[1:36:00.560 --> 1:36:03.560]  have left South Africa and come to the United States
[1:36:03.560 --> 1:36:06.560]  exactly 650,000 of them.
[1:36:06.560 --> 1:36:08.560]  They're around my region.
[1:36:08.560 --> 1:36:11.560]  They build businesses. They are entrepreneurs.
[1:36:11.560 --> 1:36:13.560]  They know exactly what they're doing.
[1:36:13.560 --> 1:36:17.560]  The Steve Danins were spoiled and come out of the middle class
[1:36:17.560 --> 1:36:20.560]  and makes believe he cares about the middle class.
[1:36:20.560 --> 1:36:23.560]  South the Grand goes to Goldman Sachs,
[1:36:23.560 --> 1:36:25.560]  does some illegal trading there,
[1:36:25.560 --> 1:36:27.560]  creates his own investment company,
[1:36:27.560 --> 1:36:29.560]  creates his own movie company,
[1:36:29.560 --> 1:36:32.560]  and makes believe he created Ray Park.
[1:36:32.560 --> 1:36:34.560]  The truth is, he's done nothing.
[1:36:34.560 --> 1:36:37.560]  He's done nothing but push himself into the circle.
[1:36:37.560 --> 1:36:39.560]  Let's talk about what this means
[1:36:39.560 --> 1:36:42.560]  with the ex-FBI lawyer Klein Smith being indicted
[1:36:42.560 --> 1:36:44.560]  and what you hear with your ear to the ground

[1:39:51.560 --> 1:39:53.560]  When the corrupt establishment
[1:39:53.560 --> 1:39:56.560]  began pushing Joe Biden two years ago,
[1:39:56.560 --> 1:39:59.560]  they knew he had serious cognitive problems.
[1:39:59.560 --> 1:40:01.560]  He has always been an empty suit
[1:40:01.560 --> 1:40:03.560]  that does what he's told by the globalist
[1:40:03.560 --> 1:40:05.560]  and their allied crime syndicates.
[1:40:05.560 --> 1:40:07.560]  Kamala Harris is even worse
[1:40:07.560 --> 1:40:08.560]  than does whatever she's told.
[1:40:08.560 --> 1:40:11.560]  She's bought and paid for by Silicon Valley,
[1:40:11.560 --> 1:40:13.560]  the Chai Combs and others.
[1:40:13.560 --> 1:40:15.560]  So, she has been chosen
[1:40:15.560 --> 1:40:17.560]  because she's part African
[1:40:17.560 --> 1:40:19.560]  and now anyone that criticizes her
[1:40:19.560 --> 1:40:22.560]  will be called a racist and evil
[1:40:22.560 --> 1:40:24.560]  and she is now above reproach.
[1:40:24.560 --> 1:40:26.560]  Ladies and gentlemen, we must expose
[1:40:26.560 --> 1:40:29.560]  this monster for who she is.
[1:40:29.560 --> 1:40:31.560]  We must expose the fact that she wanted
[1:40:31.560 --> 1:40:33.560]  minimum sentences for black people
[1:40:33.560 --> 1:40:35.560]  three times longer than white people
[1:40:35.560 --> 1:40:37.560]  and that the woman is a monster.
[1:40:37.560 --> 1:40:39.560]  Kamala Harris will end up
[1:40:39.560 --> 1:40:41.560]  being our president if they're able
[1:40:41.560 --> 1:40:43.560]  to steal the election
[1:40:43.560 --> 1:40:45.560]  and she is a 110%
[1:40:45.560 --> 1:40:47.560]  new world order puppet.
[1:40:47.560 --> 1:40:49.560]  Now more than ever, we must expose this monster.
[1:40:49.560 --> 1:41:13.560]  We must expose the globalist.
[1:41:13.560 --> 1:41:21.560]  And thank you.
[1:41:21.560 --> 1:41:24.060]  All right, Dr. Steve McShenix here with us.
[1:41:24.060 --> 1:41:25.560]  I don't wanna spend too much time on banning
[1:41:25.560 --> 1:41:27.560]  though it is important
[1:41:27.560 --> 1:41:30.560]  because it ties into Durham
[1:41:30.560 --> 1:41:32.560]  and there's also a prosecutor in Texas
[1:41:32.560 --> 1:41:35.560]  and I've been told by sources that have never lied to me
[1:41:35.560 --> 1:41:37.560]  that Trump has said many more coming
[1:41:37.560 --> 1:41:39.560]  and he's not running the investigations
[1:41:39.560 --> 1:41:41.560]  but that Trump has been told
[1:41:41.560 --> 1:41:44.620]  No, no, we're going to indict at least a dozen people.
[1:41:44.620 --> 1:41:48.240]  Will they all be mid-level, like this particular individual
[1:41:48.240 --> 1:41:49.840]  that just got indicted?
[1:41:49.840 --> 1:41:53.320]  And why is Strock and Page and so many others upset?
[1:41:53.320 --> 1:41:55.360]  Will it end with Klein Smith?
[1:41:55.360 --> 1:41:59.080]  And is this connected in any way to what's happened to Bannon?
[1:42:01.480 --> 1:42:02.720]  The truth here that matters
[1:42:02.720 --> 1:42:06.280]  was Bannon and Klein Smith all had in common.
[1:42:06.280 --> 1:42:08.600]  You have to remember the Bannon came out of the Navy.
[1:42:08.600 --> 1:42:11.000]  He was part of Navy Intelligence.
[1:42:11.000 --> 1:42:12.880]  Although he didn't talk about it very much,
[1:42:12.880 --> 1:42:14.960]  he did imply he was very deep
[1:42:14.960 --> 1:42:16.960]  into the intelligence community.
[1:42:16.960 --> 1:42:19.320]  That's why he and Flynn had a problem.
[1:42:19.320 --> 1:42:23.360]  And Flynn really didn't like Bannon and wanted him out.
[1:42:23.360 --> 1:42:25.480]  Instead, it was Flynn who got into trouble
[1:42:25.480 --> 1:42:27.280]  because of his son.
[1:42:27.280 --> 1:42:29.080]  The indictment of this individual
[1:42:29.080 --> 1:42:31.840]  is far more reaching than anybody realizes.
[1:42:31.840 --> 1:42:34.600]  Actually, William Barr is surprising me
[1:42:34.600 --> 1:42:39.160]  because I've known that he was a DEI, DDO, and the CIA,
[1:42:39.160 --> 1:42:43.120]  but as an attorney general, he is going after the deep state.
[1:42:43.120 --> 1:42:46.320]  This is the beginning of going after Brennan,
[1:42:46.320 --> 1:42:50.000]  going after Mueller, going after Hayden,
[1:42:50.000 --> 1:42:51.840]  and a whole bunch of others
[1:42:51.840 --> 1:42:56.240]  who have been attempting to try a coup against Trump.
[1:42:56.240 --> 1:42:57.400]  It's not working.
[1:42:57.400 --> 1:42:59.520]  The indictments are massive.
[1:42:59.520 --> 1:43:01.960]  As I understand, they range probably
[1:43:01.960 --> 1:43:04.880]  several hundred indictments ready to go.
[1:43:04.880 --> 1:43:08.200]  And Trump has done an excellent job of keeping it quiet
[1:43:08.200 --> 1:43:10.960]  and just titrating out little by little
[1:43:10.960 --> 1:43:13.160]  as we get closer to the reelection.
[1:43:13.160 --> 1:43:18.760]  So basically, he denigrates the legitimacy of Biden.
[1:43:18.760 --> 1:43:21.920]  He's not going into the fact that I do
[1:43:21.920 --> 1:43:24.880]  and where I say Biden is senile-demented.
[1:43:24.880 --> 1:43:29.840]  Trump has enough elegance and sense of importance
[1:43:29.840 --> 1:43:31.560]  that he doesn't have to say that.
[1:43:31.560 --> 1:43:35.400]  I can say that because I was examiner in psychiatry,
[1:43:35.400 --> 1:43:36.760]  but it was obvious to me,
[1:43:36.760 --> 1:43:38.600]  and it's obvious to many others,
[1:43:38.600 --> 1:43:42.080]  and particularly with this last interview with Tom Hanks,
[1:43:42.080 --> 1:43:45.520]  Biden could not remember the day and the years
[1:43:45.520 --> 1:43:48.240]  that he was appointed as vice president.
[1:43:48.240 --> 1:43:50.480]  So we have a serious problem.
[1:43:50.480 --> 1:43:54.160]  Instead of Trump hitting it at the medical source,
[1:43:54.160 --> 1:43:57.800]  what he's doing is taking out the supporting branches
[1:43:57.800 --> 1:44:01.720]  that have kept the lying and collusions
[1:44:01.720 --> 1:44:04.800]  and the colon pals who are pathological liars,
[1:44:04.800 --> 1:44:07.640]  the Obamas who are pathological liars,
[1:44:07.640 --> 1:44:11.040]  the CIA operatives who have been pathological liars,
[1:44:11.040 --> 1:44:14.040]  he's taking them apart little by little.
[1:44:14.040 --> 1:44:18.240]  And if I were Gina Haspel and I was part of the CIA
[1:44:18.240 --> 1:44:22.160]  and I was part of the 16 units in the intelligence community,
[1:44:22.160 --> 1:44:24.520]  I would be very much concerned.
[1:44:24.520 --> 1:44:25.960]  Now, remember, months ago,
[1:44:25.960 --> 1:44:29.240]  I had told you Danin was gonna be arrested.
[1:44:29.240 --> 1:44:30.920]  And a year ago, I saw you out of...
[1:44:30.920 --> 1:44:31.760]  Well, you did say that.
[1:44:31.760 --> 1:44:32.640]  I should have started the broadcast.
[1:44:32.640 --> 1:44:35.120]  I remember, I mean, had you gotten rumblings of this
[1:44:35.120 --> 1:44:37.400]  or you said, Danin's gonna pay.
[1:44:37.400 --> 1:44:39.600]  No, no, I had no rumblings.
[1:44:39.600 --> 1:44:42.960]  One of the things that you and I do intuitively
[1:44:42.960 --> 1:44:47.960]  is it's obvious when a man like Danin gets ahead of himself.
[1:44:48.360 --> 1:44:50.920]  It's obvious when he's a self-aggrandizer,
[1:44:50.920 --> 1:44:52.840]  when he needs to be in every show
[1:44:52.840 --> 1:44:55.720]  and every particular radio station
[1:44:55.720 --> 1:44:58.080]  and he has to make himself so important
[1:44:59.040 --> 1:45:01.360]  to the White House and to the United States
[1:45:01.360 --> 1:45:03.960]  that in fact, there's nothing there.
[1:45:03.960 --> 1:45:08.960]  He has no, he has no gravitas either intellectually
[1:45:09.720 --> 1:45:10.560]  or emotionally.
[1:45:10.560 --> 1:45:11.960]  So you don't think they've gone after Danin
[1:45:11.960 --> 1:45:14.000]  to embarrass Trump and confuse the wall?
[1:45:14.000 --> 1:45:16.600]  You think it was known that he was doing some wrong things
[1:45:16.600 --> 1:45:18.880]  so the light got lit to get him?
[1:45:18.880 --> 1:45:21.560]  Well, look, Trump was reading the book
[1:45:21.560 --> 1:45:24.680]  when he saw what Danin wrote about Ivanka.
[1:45:24.680 --> 1:45:31.680]  Dumb is a stone and Kushner is a total corrupt individual
[1:45:31.680 --> 1:45:34.480]  and that Trump is neither worth,
[1:45:34.480 --> 1:45:37.800]  he's not worth billions of dollars, but only a few million
[1:45:37.800 --> 1:45:39.280]  and he's going to go down.
[1:45:39.280 --> 1:45:42.200]  Danin has talked on both sides of his mouth.
[1:45:42.200 --> 1:45:45.680]  What eventually happened, and I think Trump allowed this
[1:45:45.680 --> 1:45:47.600]  to happen was to let the other guys
[1:45:47.600 --> 1:45:50.520]  handle the prosecution and the indictment
[1:45:50.520 --> 1:45:54.280]  while at the same time he maintained Danin close to him.
[1:45:54.280 --> 1:45:55.800]  That's a brilliant maneuver.
[1:45:55.800 --> 1:45:57.560]  Machiavellian would have liked that.
[1:45:57.560 --> 1:46:00.360]  He kept all of these people close to them
[1:46:00.360 --> 1:46:04.000]  giving them the sense that he was still involved with them
[1:46:04.000 --> 1:46:08.320]  while in turn he had ordered the people around him
[1:46:08.320 --> 1:46:10.760]  who were in the deep state, his deep state
[1:46:10.760 --> 1:46:13.720]  to take down that deep state one after another
[1:46:13.720 --> 1:46:17.000]  and Danin was the key to a lot of the corruption.
[1:46:17.000 --> 1:46:17.920]  Well, I totally agree with you.
[1:46:17.920 --> 1:46:20.200]  So let's do a 35,000 foot view
[1:46:20.200 --> 1:46:21.560]  because you're a smart guy.
[1:46:21.560 --> 1:46:24.560]  You said on my show 15 years ago,
[1:46:24.560 --> 1:46:27.280]  hey, both East and West Coast are going to collapse.
[1:46:27.280 --> 1:46:29.760]  It'll be the Midwest, the South, America will rebuild.
[1:46:29.760 --> 1:46:31.120]  The Democrats are going to be a failed party.
[1:46:31.120 --> 1:46:32.320]  The EU is going to collapse.
[1:46:32.320 --> 1:46:34.600]  I remember thinking, man, you're being way too optimistic.
[1:46:34.600 --> 1:46:35.880]  We're basically there.
[1:46:35.880 --> 1:46:37.640]  It's all happening as you saw.
[1:46:37.640 --> 1:46:39.840]  And then you talked about all this with Danin
[1:46:39.840 --> 1:46:40.680]  and the rest of it.
[1:46:40.680 --> 1:46:41.520]  You talked about don't worry,
[1:46:41.520 --> 1:46:42.880]  the Democrats are going to self-destruct
[1:46:42.880 --> 1:46:45.400]  whether destroying their own cities, their own states
[1:46:45.400 --> 1:46:47.320]  of the way that they knew two years ago
[1:46:47.320 --> 1:46:48.960]  he'd had another stroke and could barely talk.
[1:46:48.960 --> 1:46:52.400]  Now they're having to actually hide him 74 days out.
[1:46:52.400 --> 1:46:54.040]  He can't even say a sentence.
[1:46:54.040 --> 1:46:56.480]  So the cognitive degeneration has accelerated.
[1:46:56.480 --> 1:46:58.200]  I'm not a doctor like you,
[1:46:58.200 --> 1:47:00.200]  but looking at the doctor of the brain,
[1:47:00.200 --> 1:47:02.680]  but looking at this, it really does just say
[1:47:02.680 --> 1:47:04.280]  that they're also disconnected,
[1:47:04.280 --> 1:47:07.360]  that they are self-destructing out of pure incompetence.
[1:47:07.360 --> 1:47:09.600]  And then I just wonder why it isn't even easier
[1:47:09.600 --> 1:47:10.760]  to defeat them then.
[1:47:12.240 --> 1:47:16.760]  Because the moment of defeat hasn't come yet.
[1:47:16.760 --> 1:47:20.720]  It's what Trump is doing is doing it by attrition,
[1:47:20.720 --> 1:47:22.520]  which is the correct way to do it.
[1:47:22.520 --> 1:47:25.640]  In other words, he's not allowing the Democrats
[1:47:25.640 --> 1:47:28.080]  to recoup any of their strength.
[1:47:28.080 --> 1:47:30.400]  And basically he's confusing them
[1:47:30.400 --> 1:47:33.240]  as to where the strategic focus is.
[1:47:33.240 --> 1:47:34.560]  Is it against Biden?
[1:47:34.560 --> 1:47:35.840]  Well, not quite.
[1:47:35.840 --> 1:47:37.960]  He hit Kamala Harris.
[1:47:37.960 --> 1:47:38.800]  Was he happy?
[1:47:38.800 --> 1:47:40.680]  Was Trump happy we had Kamala Harris?
[1:47:40.680 --> 1:47:42.120]  You better believe it.
[1:47:42.120 --> 1:47:45.560]  You have an Indian from Jamaican roots
[1:47:45.560 --> 1:47:49.280]  whose father was the professor emeritus
[1:47:49.280 --> 1:47:51.120]  of Stanford University.
[1:47:51.120 --> 1:47:54.120]  And you're saying to me on the storyline
[1:47:54.120 --> 1:47:57.440]  that Kamala had to be bussed into Berkeley
[1:47:57.440 --> 1:47:59.080]  for integration.
[1:47:59.080 --> 1:48:00.360]  That's nonsense.
[1:48:00.360 --> 1:48:02.480]  The whole story was nonsense.
[1:48:02.480 --> 1:48:04.840]  The notion that she in any way deserved
[1:48:04.840 --> 1:48:06.920]  any political accruement-
[1:48:06.920 --> 1:48:09.480]  She's a bigger dud than Pocahontas.
[1:48:09.480 --> 1:48:10.480]  And again, why would they-
[1:48:10.480 --> 1:48:11.840]  Well, she is corrupt.
[1:48:11.840 --> 1:48:14.840]  She's deceptive, but he wants that to come to the-
[1:48:14.840 --> 1:48:16.440]  You know, I agree that she's the worst choice.
[1:48:16.440 --> 1:48:17.640]  Why would they pick?
[1:48:17.640 --> 1:48:19.600]  We all agree that she's the worst choice.
[1:48:19.600 --> 1:48:21.520]  She was a corrupt prosecutor.
[1:48:21.520 --> 1:48:22.680]  Everybody knows it.
[1:48:22.680 --> 1:48:24.240]  Why the hell would they pick her then?
[1:48:24.240 --> 1:48:25.920]  Just delusion?
[1:48:25.920 --> 1:48:27.520]  No.
[1:48:27.520 --> 1:48:30.840]  What it is is when you are so angry
[1:48:30.840 --> 1:48:34.320]  and you think you are so smart as the Democrats do.
[1:48:34.320 --> 1:48:37.000]  Remember, the Democrats and the liberals
[1:48:37.000 --> 1:48:40.280]  think of themselves as basically smart,
[1:48:40.280 --> 1:48:42.600]  educated, entitled.
[1:48:42.600 --> 1:48:46.840]  They feel that you and I and a bunch of wackos on the right
[1:48:46.840 --> 1:48:49.320]  are really not relevant to the whole course
[1:48:49.320 --> 1:48:50.800]  of American history.
[1:48:50.800 --> 1:48:52.400]  We're conspirators.
[1:48:52.400 --> 1:48:54.840]  Every time you read about conspiracy,
[1:48:54.840 --> 1:48:57.280]  it's Alex Jones.
[1:48:57.280 --> 1:48:59.080]  Of course, you can put down Steve Picciani,
[1:48:59.080 --> 1:49:03.080]  but they won't dare because I would sue them for libel.
[1:49:03.080 --> 1:49:05.360]  And that's triple damages for me.
[1:49:05.360 --> 1:49:09.440]  But my point to you is that this is the course of action
[1:49:09.440 --> 1:49:12.240]  that occurs when you feel entitled,
[1:49:12.240 --> 1:49:15.600]  when you are arrogant, and when you're incompetent,
[1:49:15.600 --> 1:49:18.600]  the three elements of self-destruction.
[1:49:18.600 --> 1:49:19.440]  The Democrats are-
[1:49:19.440 --> 1:49:20.600]  Look at this video of them last night.
[1:49:20.600 --> 1:49:22.280]  They look like clowns.
[1:49:22.280 --> 1:49:23.200]  No one's even there.
[1:49:23.200 --> 1:49:24.040]  They're balling.
[1:49:24.040 --> 1:49:27.840]  I mean, if I was producing a comedy movie,
[1:49:27.840 --> 1:49:29.560]  like Spinal Tap, it's a masterpiece,
[1:49:29.560 --> 1:49:31.200]  watched again last week,
[1:49:31.200 --> 1:49:34.080]  top actors could not come off this wooden,
[1:49:34.080 --> 1:49:36.680]  this fake, this most disingenuous.
[1:49:36.680 --> 1:49:39.600]  I mean, they are so bad, they're good.
[1:49:39.600 --> 1:49:43.400]  I mean, they are so pathetic, it's a masterpiece.
[1:49:43.400 --> 1:49:45.160]  But while you hit it on the head,
[1:49:45.160 --> 1:49:46.560]  it's the three stooges,
[1:49:46.560 --> 1:49:49.200]  but now you've got the Democratic stooges.
[1:49:49.200 --> 1:49:51.640]  Each one is dumber than the other.
[1:49:51.640 --> 1:49:55.480]  Each one is a greater pathological liar than the other.
[1:49:55.480 --> 1:50:00.320]  Remember, Trump was accused of being the master
[1:50:00.320 --> 1:50:01.440]  of a reality show,
[1:50:01.440 --> 1:50:03.200]  and that this president looks like
[1:50:03.200 --> 1:50:05.240]  he's running a reality show.
[1:50:05.240 --> 1:50:06.680]  That came from the great words
[1:50:06.680 --> 1:50:08.400]  of one of our Secretary of State,
[1:50:08.400 --> 1:50:11.120]  another pathological liar from Yale.
[1:50:11.120 --> 1:50:11.960]  And Trump is.
[1:50:11.960 --> 1:50:14.720]  He's running a thousand times better than they are.
[1:50:14.720 --> 1:50:18.240]  Well, you know, act in a certain way,
[1:50:18.240 --> 1:50:22.040]  you can act incompetent or act as if you're disarray,
[1:50:22.040 --> 1:50:24.880]  but when you start arresting people,
[1:50:24.880 --> 1:50:26.560]  that's your opposition.
[1:50:26.560 --> 1:50:28.480]  If I were in the opposition, I'd say,
[1:50:28.480 --> 1:50:31.240]  wait a minute, we got a problem here.
[1:50:31.240 --> 1:50:32.480]  They don't do that,
[1:50:32.480 --> 1:50:35.200]  because basically every one of their operatives
[1:50:35.200 --> 1:50:36.640]  are highly paid.
[1:50:36.640 --> 1:50:38.680]  There was never accountability.
[1:50:38.680 --> 1:50:41.240]  None of them have ever put in a president.
[1:50:41.240 --> 1:50:44.320]  Obama was a freak of the CIA,
[1:50:44.320 --> 1:50:48.800]  black, lying, homosexual, complete farce,
[1:50:48.800 --> 1:50:51.720]  who then calls our president in a farce
[1:50:51.720 --> 1:50:55.040]  and then delivers Michelle Obama,
[1:50:55.040 --> 1:50:59.520]  a total nobody who was already threatening Harvard
[1:50:59.520 --> 1:51:00.360]  and Princeton.
[1:51:00.360 --> 1:51:01.200]  What do you think of Big Mike?
[1:51:01.200 --> 1:51:02.440]  That's her nickname now.
[1:51:02.440 --> 1:51:06.720]  What do you think of Big Mike?
[1:51:06.720 --> 1:51:10.240]  I think she is exactly what she is.
[1:51:10.240 --> 1:51:14.560]  She is a asexual individual.
[1:51:14.560 --> 1:51:15.520]  I gotta be careful.
[1:51:15.520 --> 1:51:19.040]  Hold on, we're gonna come back with her threat to America,
[1:51:19.040 --> 1:51:21.320]  that things are gonna get really bad if we reelect Trump
[1:51:21.320 --> 1:51:23.720]  and the Atlantic monthly saying
[1:51:23.720 --> 1:51:25.160]  they're gonna burn the country down.
[1:51:25.160 --> 1:51:26.160]  What do we do?
[1:51:26.160 --> 1:51:27.760]  I wonder about this seriously,
[1:51:27.760 --> 1:51:29.280]  because I don't wanna underestimate the enemy.
[1:51:29.280 --> 1:51:30.200]  Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[1:51:30.200 --> 1:51:31.040]  We gotta go to break.
[1:51:31.040 --> 1:51:32.640]  I don't understand, because they said
[1:51:32.640 --> 1:51:34.960]  they're gonna secede in Trump wins.
[1:51:34.960 --> 1:51:36.400]  So what does that look like?
[1:51:36.400 --> 1:51:38.440]  We'll talk about Big Mike when we come back.
[1:51:42.440 --> 1:51:44.040]  It was a sleeper product.
[1:51:44.040 --> 1:51:46.920]  It wasn't popular at first, but as people tried it,
[1:51:46.920 --> 1:51:49.240]  it's become one of our top five best sellers.
[1:51:49.240 --> 1:51:51.720]  I'm talking about the eight pack power stack,
[1:51:51.720 --> 1:51:54.840]  13 different pills filled with super nutrients,
[1:51:54.840 --> 1:51:56.840]  vitamins, minerals, and more
[1:51:56.840 --> 1:51:59.160]  that you take in the morning and one pack and at night.
[1:51:59.160 --> 1:52:02.440]  It's available right now at 60% off
[1:52:02.440 --> 1:52:06.000]  for a limited time when you get it with survival shield X2
[1:52:06.000 --> 1:52:07.480]  that's now back in stock.

[1:53:45.080 --> 1:53:48.160]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:53:48.160 --> 1:53:52.160]  And now the heavyweight champion of the world.
[1:53:52.160 --> 1:53:55.160]  Weighing in an astounding 240 pounds
[1:53:55.160 --> 1:53:57.160]  of pure linebacker muscle.
[1:53:57.160 --> 1:54:02.160]  Big Michelle Mike.
[1:54:02.160 --> 1:54:04.160]  Ha ha ha.
[1:54:04.160 --> 1:54:07.160]  Now seriously, Joan Revers came out.
[1:54:07.160 --> 1:54:10.160]  And now the heavyweight champion of the world.
[1:54:10.160 --> 1:54:13.160]  Weighing in an astounding 240 pounds
[1:54:13.160 --> 1:54:15.160]  of pure linebacker muscle.
[1:54:15.160 --> 1:54:18.160]  Now seriously, Joan Revers came out
[1:54:18.160 --> 1:54:20.160]  and just officiated over a gay wedding
[1:54:20.160 --> 1:54:21.160]  right before she died.
[1:54:21.160 --> 1:54:24.160]  And she said, listen, we don't need a first gay president.
[1:54:24.160 --> 1:54:27.160]  Obama's gay and Michelle's a training.
[1:54:27.160 --> 1:54:29.160]  Now that's Joan Revers, the big liberal.
[1:54:29.160 --> 1:54:31.160]  She was dead a few months later.
[1:54:31.160 --> 1:54:36.160]  But we do have all this footage of clearly Michelle Obama
[1:54:36.160 --> 1:54:38.160]  likes to have like a big rubber snake.
[1:54:38.160 --> 1:54:39.160]  You can buy the store in her pants.
[1:54:39.160 --> 1:54:40.160]  That's all I'm saying.
[1:54:40.160 --> 1:54:41.160]  I'm not saying.
[1:54:41.160 --> 1:54:42.160]  There it is right there.
[1:54:42.160 --> 1:54:43.160]  A roll of quarters adjusting it.
[1:54:43.160 --> 1:54:44.160]  I'm not saying that she's a training.
[1:54:44.160 --> 1:54:46.160]  I'm not attacking her for that.
[1:54:46.160 --> 1:54:48.160]  I'm just saying she's got bigger shoulders than Obama.
[1:54:48.160 --> 1:54:52.160]  And you know, the word is, I mean, Barry's dad was a famous
[1:54:52.160 --> 1:54:54.160]  communist pornographer and all the rest of it.
[1:54:54.160 --> 1:54:55.160]  Frank Marshall Davis.
[1:54:55.160 --> 1:54:58.160]  This is a short segment, but Dr. Steve Pacinac bestselling
[1:54:58.160 --> 1:54:59.160]  author, researcher, psychiatrist.
[1:54:59.160 --> 1:55:02.160]  What do you make of the phenomenon of it being the
[1:55:02.160 --> 1:55:04.160]  number one thing on Twitter the other day, Big Mike,
[1:55:04.160 --> 1:55:07.160]  people thinking that she's a man.
[1:55:07.160 --> 1:55:10.160]  I just see this as the public not trusting anything we see
[1:55:10.160 --> 1:55:13.160]  from this group.
[1:55:13.160 --> 1:55:14.160]  I agree with you.
[1:55:14.160 --> 1:55:17.160]  First of all, in order to understand Big Mike or Obama,
[1:55:17.160 --> 1:55:21.160]  you've got to go back to a woman by the name of Valerie Jaret,
[1:55:21.160 --> 1:55:24.160]  an African American, but not completely.
[1:55:24.160 --> 1:55:28.160]  This was a woman whose father was in the CIA and a physician
[1:55:28.160 --> 1:55:32.160]  in Iran, and Valerie Jaret was born in Iran.
[1:55:32.160 --> 1:55:37.160]  So you get a CIA operative coming into Chicago and picks
[1:55:37.160 --> 1:55:41.160]  another CIA operative or covers for that CIA operative,
[1:55:41.160 --> 1:55:45.160]  Obama or Barry Sorrell, whose mother was CIA in Indonesia
[1:55:45.160 --> 1:55:49.160]  and maternal grandparents worked under me at the East
[1:55:49.160 --> 1:55:51.160]  West Center, which was CIA.
[1:55:51.160 --> 1:55:55.160]  So what you have here is the old CIA coming to the
[1:55:55.160 --> 1:55:56.160]  fourth ground.
[1:55:56.160 --> 1:55:58.160]  That's why Brennan becomes an important element.
[1:55:58.160 --> 1:56:00.160]  I was about to say, why are they obsessed with that?
[1:56:00.160 --> 1:56:01.160]  Because I've researched it.
[1:56:01.160 --> 1:56:02.160]  I can't figure it out.
[1:56:02.160 --> 1:56:07.160]  In Indonesia, he wrote that he had a transsexual nanny.
[1:56:07.160 --> 1:56:11.160]  Well, let's, for a minute, forget the transsexual part
[1:56:11.160 --> 1:56:14.160]  and focus on the part where they really want to take down
[1:56:14.160 --> 1:56:15.160]  the government.
[1:56:15.160 --> 1:56:19.160]  And where the beginnings of this went on, let's say,
[1:56:19.160 --> 1:56:20.160]  from 9-11.
[1:56:20.160 --> 1:56:24.160]  What you're seeing is the aftermath again of 9-11,
[1:56:24.160 --> 1:56:27.160]  the agency trying to combat, trying to make a coup.
[1:56:27.160 --> 1:56:30.160]  We have not cleaned out any of the CIA.
[1:56:30.160 --> 1:56:31.160]  We've not.
[1:56:31.160 --> 1:56:33.160]  So you're saying it's corrupt, crazy, deep state elements
[1:56:33.160 --> 1:56:35.160]  trying to use their leverage inside government
[1:56:35.160 --> 1:56:37.160]  to overthrow the Republic.
[1:56:37.160 --> 1:56:38.160]  Correct.
[1:56:38.160 --> 1:56:41.160]  And we've been saying it for over 20 years.
[1:56:41.160 --> 1:56:45.160]  And unfortunately, as I said in your last show,
[1:56:45.160 --> 1:56:48.160]  I would have hoped Trump could clear it out faster
[1:56:48.160 --> 1:56:49.160]  than he is now.
[1:56:49.160 --> 1:56:53.160]  But he is starting to clear it out piece by piece using
[1:56:53.160 --> 1:56:56.160]  the law, which is another very effective way.
[1:56:56.160 --> 1:56:58.160]  I would not have used the law.
[1:56:58.160 --> 1:57:00.160]  I would have used executive power.
[1:57:00.160 --> 1:57:04.160]  Now, in terms of Big Mike or Obama,
[1:57:04.160 --> 1:57:07.160]  that show and that charade will never continue,
[1:57:07.160 --> 1:57:10.160]  because clearly it's already been exposed,
[1:57:10.160 --> 1:57:13.160]  but they don't care in the sense that...
[1:57:13.160 --> 1:57:15.160]  I was going to say Obama was on a radio show
[1:57:15.160 --> 1:57:17.160]  and made a joke about Big Mike.
[1:57:17.160 --> 1:57:19.160]  Well, he can make...
[1:57:19.160 --> 1:57:20.160]  Listen, he's a joke.
[1:57:20.160 --> 1:57:22.160]  He's a joke himself.
[1:57:22.160 --> 1:57:24.160]  He never went to Columbia.
[1:57:24.160 --> 1:57:28.160]  He went to a school that he doesn't want to admit in L.A.
[1:57:28.160 --> 1:57:32.160]  He went to maybe Harvard where he basically
[1:57:32.160 --> 1:57:34.160]  couldn't get into Harvard.
[1:57:34.160 --> 1:57:37.160]  He came out of a private school in Hawaii.
[1:57:37.160 --> 1:57:40.160]  His mother was a CIA white woman operative,
[1:57:40.160 --> 1:57:45.160]  and his maternal grandparents were CIA.
[1:57:45.160 --> 1:57:49.160]  So there's nothing about him that's really sui generis real.
[1:57:49.160 --> 1:57:51.160]  He's phony, and he knows it.
[1:57:51.160 --> 1:57:53.160]  But he plays that part.
[1:57:53.160 --> 1:57:55.160]  He's become part of his own reality.
[1:57:55.160 --> 1:57:58.160]  It's like being an actor in a show.
[1:57:58.160 --> 1:58:01.160]  So he's got Big Mike or whatever you want to call it.
[1:58:01.160 --> 1:58:04.160]  You got Valerie Jered, who's your producer.
[1:58:04.160 --> 1:58:08.160]  And ironically, Rami Emanuel, the one Jewish guy
[1:58:08.160 --> 1:58:11.160]  who had been the mayor, was keeping it quiet
[1:58:11.160 --> 1:58:14.160]  to the extent that he could keep it quiet.
[1:58:14.160 --> 1:58:16.160]  Once he left, he and his brother,
[1:58:16.160 --> 1:58:18.160]  Ari Emanuel, who's head of the William Morris
[1:58:18.160 --> 1:58:21.160]  Endeavor Agency, a talent group,
[1:58:21.160 --> 1:58:23.160]  they just went off to the side
[1:58:23.160 --> 1:58:26.160]  and spent their own life the way they wanted to.
[1:58:26.160 --> 1:58:29.160]  They made their own millions without having to worry about
[1:58:29.160 --> 1:58:31.160]  where the money was coming in.
[1:58:31.160 --> 1:58:34.160]  For Obama, he wanted to leave a legacy,
[1:58:34.160 --> 1:58:36.160]  which will be kind of a joke,
[1:58:36.160 --> 1:58:39.160]  but the reality of the moment is so serious.
[1:58:39.160 --> 1:58:41.160]  Let's talk about the reality of the moment.
[1:58:41.160 --> 1:58:43.160]  I'll stop joking in 60 seconds under Steve Pachinik,
[1:58:43.160 --> 1:58:45.160]  StevePachinik.com is our guest. Stay with us.
[1:58:45.160 --> 1:59:00.160]  But mark that site, StevePachinik.com.
[1:59:16.160 --> 1:59:18.160]  Then comes the apps on your phones
[1:59:18.160 --> 1:59:20.160]  and the global social credit score.
[1:59:20.160 --> 1:59:23.160]  Now being rolled out by Virginia, California,
[1:59:23.160 --> 1:59:25.160]  and others, it's not coming, it's here.
[1:59:25.160 --> 1:59:28.160]  And then the inoculations, if you ever want to leave your house,
[1:59:28.160 --> 1:59:30.160]  which amounts to forced inoculations.
[1:59:30.160 --> 1:59:33.160]  This is the medical tyranny takeover.
[1:59:33.160 --> 1:59:36.160]  These are not classic vaccines that have their own problems.
[1:59:36.160 --> 1:59:39.160]  These are DNA vaccines that change your DNA
[1:59:39.160 --> 1:59:42.160]  and are having massive, serious side effects.
[1:59:42.160 --> 1:59:44.160]  Guaranteed this is about depopulation,
[1:59:44.160 --> 1:59:46.160]  Bill Gates admits that.
[1:59:46.160 --> 1:59:48.160]  This is an emergency. Resist or die.
[1:59:48.160 --> 1:59:50.160]  The New World Order is here.
[2:00:00.160 --> 2:00:01.160]  All right, under Steve.
[2:00:05.160 --> 2:00:07.160]  Right under Steve Pachinik is our guest here,
[2:00:07.160 --> 2:00:11.160]  and we can joke around about Obama and Pelosi
[2:00:11.160 --> 2:00:13.160]  and Biden not being able to talk.
[2:00:13.160 --> 2:00:17.160]  But there's a frighteningness to the incompetency
[2:00:17.160 --> 2:00:19.160]  and the delusion and the disconnect
[2:00:19.160 --> 2:00:21.160]  and all the weird little sycophants
[2:00:21.160 --> 2:00:25.160]  that carry around these relics.
[2:00:25.160 --> 2:00:27.160]  I don't even say relics because they're age.
[2:00:27.160 --> 2:00:30.160]  Whether they're young or old, these operatives are so,
[2:00:30.160 --> 2:00:34.160]  not just in the past, they're in their own delusional
[2:00:34.160 --> 2:00:37.160]  phantom zone, not connected to reality.
[2:00:37.160 --> 2:00:40.160]  And then I see the talking point start about a year ago,
[2:00:40.160 --> 2:00:41.160]  get intense six months ago,
[2:00:41.160 --> 2:00:43.160]  and now Crescendo the last month,
[2:00:43.160 --> 2:00:46.160]  Trump's gonna contest the election,
[2:00:46.160 --> 2:00:47.160]  we gotta have 25th Amendment,
[2:00:47.160 --> 2:00:49.160]  or we gotta have riots to removing,
[2:00:49.160 --> 2:00:52.160]  and then if he doesn't step down,
[2:00:52.160 --> 2:00:55.160]  we're gonna have the states to see that are blue
[2:00:55.160 --> 2:00:57.160]  or have popular vote,
[2:00:57.160 --> 2:00:59.160]  and we're gonna have our own inauguration.
[2:00:59.160 --> 2:01:01.160]  And I'm reading this in the New York Times,
[2:01:01.160 --> 2:01:03.160]  in Atlantic Monthly, in the CFR,
[2:01:03.160 --> 2:01:05.160]  meaning that's what they want.
[2:01:05.160 --> 2:01:07.160]  And then Pelosi comes out on TV a month ago
[2:01:07.160 --> 2:01:09.160]  and externalizes it, and then when that happens,
[2:01:09.160 --> 2:01:12.160]  every one of the pundits, from Van Jones,
[2:01:12.160 --> 2:01:15.160]  to Senator Schumer, to Hillary,
[2:01:15.160 --> 2:01:17.160]  they all come out to Eric Holder
[2:01:17.160 --> 2:01:20.160]  and regurgitate this and say,
[2:01:20.160 --> 2:01:23.160]  we're normalizing it, we're gonna secede,
[2:01:23.160 --> 2:01:24.160]  and take the country with them,
[2:01:24.160 --> 2:01:27.160]  and we're back to the early 1860s, Dr. Pachett.
[2:01:27.160 --> 2:01:28.160]  So this is serious.
[2:01:28.160 --> 2:01:30.160]  If they even attempt this,
[2:01:30.160 --> 2:01:31.160]  it could really hurt the stock market,
[2:01:31.160 --> 2:01:33.160]  hurt the country, break it up.
[2:01:33.160 --> 2:01:36.160]  I mean, we can't just let them criminally claim
[2:01:36.160 --> 2:01:38.160]  that they're gonna take states that Democrats win
[2:01:38.160 --> 2:01:40.160]  and break away from the nation.
[2:01:41.160 --> 2:01:42.160]  Let me say the following.
[2:01:42.160 --> 2:01:44.160]  Number one, that's never gonna happen,
[2:01:44.160 --> 2:01:48.160]  because they're not capable of doing it.
[2:01:48.160 --> 2:01:50.160]  A governor cannot secede.
[2:01:50.160 --> 2:01:54.160]  We have about 75,000 troops already deployed
[2:01:54.160 --> 2:01:57.160]  all over the United States to make certain
[2:01:57.160 --> 2:02:01.160]  that no military coup or civilian coup is attempted.
[2:02:01.160 --> 2:02:04.160]  So from that point of view, I'm not concerned.
[2:02:04.160 --> 2:02:07.160]  From the point of view that they're making a lot of noise
[2:02:07.160 --> 2:02:10.160]  and they're more desperate than they have been before,
[2:02:10.160 --> 2:02:11.160]  I do agree.
[2:02:11.160 --> 2:02:15.160]  That noise in some ways is affecting the market,
[2:02:15.160 --> 2:02:18.160]  but believe it or not, not that much of the market,
[2:02:18.160 --> 2:02:21.160]  because our market and the specific companies
[2:02:21.160 --> 2:02:23.160]  have been fully valued.
[2:02:23.160 --> 2:02:25.160]  Think of this for a moment.
[2:02:25.160 --> 2:02:27.160]  I'm a day trader, and I'm saying to you
[2:02:27.160 --> 2:02:30.160]  that in the middle of a pandemic,
[2:02:30.160 --> 2:02:32.160]  in the middle of economic problems,
[2:02:32.160 --> 2:02:35.160]  we have stocks that are fully valued
[2:02:35.160 --> 2:02:38.160]  to a couple of hundred points,
[2:02:38.160 --> 2:02:40.160]  and they're not going up or down
[2:02:40.160 --> 2:02:43.160]  because their value went up as a result of Trump.
[2:02:43.160 --> 2:02:46.160]  If Biden gets in, I will summarily tell you
[2:02:46.160 --> 2:02:48.160]  we will have a crash,
[2:02:48.160 --> 2:02:50.160]  but there's no way Biden's coming in.
[2:02:50.160 --> 2:02:53.160]  The reason for that is very simple.
[2:02:53.160 --> 2:02:56.160]  The factor of the matter is the number of people
[2:02:56.160 --> 2:02:59.160]  who've supported Trump has never really been
[2:02:59.160 --> 2:03:01.160]  calculated very accurately.
[2:03:01.160 --> 2:03:03.160]  Many of them are really what we had
[2:03:03.160 --> 2:03:05.160]  in the Nixon administration,
[2:03:05.160 --> 2:03:08.160]  what we call the silent majority.
[2:03:08.160 --> 2:03:10.160]  But when you drive around in the South,
[2:03:10.160 --> 2:03:13.160]  when I drive around in the north-central part
[2:03:13.160 --> 2:03:15.160]  of Florida and elsewhere,
[2:03:15.160 --> 2:03:17.160]  you will see more Trump signs
[2:03:17.160 --> 2:03:19.160]  than you've ever seen in your life,
[2:03:19.160 --> 2:03:22.160]  plus you have very serious contenders
[2:03:22.160 --> 2:03:24.160]  who are saying quiet.
[2:03:24.160 --> 2:03:26.160]  Are they going to attempt anything
[2:03:26.160 --> 2:03:28.160]  that will overthrow the government?
[2:03:28.160 --> 2:03:31.160]  No. The reason for that? Very simple.
[2:03:31.160 --> 2:03:34.160]  They are basically the welfare victims
[2:03:34.160 --> 2:03:36.160]  of their own salaries.
[2:03:36.160 --> 2:03:38.160]  What do I mean?
[2:03:38.160 --> 2:03:40.160]  Dianne Feinstein, 85 years old,
[2:03:40.160 --> 2:03:42.160]  30 years in the Senate,
[2:03:42.160 --> 2:03:44.160]  became a multimillionaire
[2:03:44.160 --> 2:03:47.160]  out of corruption and obedience.
[2:03:47.160 --> 2:03:50.160]  Nancy Pelosi, as dumb as the day is long,
[2:03:50.160 --> 2:03:53.160]  former Italian Mathioso,
[2:03:53.160 --> 2:03:56.160]  the mafia family, multimillionaire,
[2:03:56.160 --> 2:03:58.160]  and wants to remain there
[2:03:58.160 --> 2:04:00.160]  for the last dying breath.
[2:04:00.160 --> 2:04:02.160]  And I can go on with Schumer.
[2:04:02.160 --> 2:04:04.160]  And as I said to you,
[2:04:04.160 --> 2:04:06.160]  the old Jewish Italian alliance
[2:04:06.160 --> 2:04:09.160]  that really arose from the mob days
[2:04:09.160 --> 2:04:11.160]  in the 1940s and 50s,
[2:04:11.160 --> 2:04:14.160]  when the Jews, Maya Lansky, Luciano,
[2:04:14.160 --> 2:04:17.160]  and eventually they took it over in politics,
[2:04:17.160 --> 2:04:19.160]  those days are gone.
[2:04:19.160 --> 2:04:21.160]  And what we're getting instead now
[2:04:21.160 --> 2:04:23.160]  is we're getting surprised.
[2:04:23.160 --> 2:04:26.160]  Trump, a non-politician.
[2:04:26.160 --> 2:04:28.160]  Guess what? We're going to probably
[2:04:28.160 --> 2:04:30.160]  one day get Jared Kushner
[2:04:30.160 --> 2:04:32.160]  or an Ivanka.
[2:04:32.160 --> 2:04:34.160]  And the reason for that is
[2:04:34.160 --> 2:04:36.160]  he's opened the pathway
[2:04:36.160 --> 2:04:38.160]  for business people to understand
[2:04:38.160 --> 2:04:40.160]  that the Republic is based on
[2:04:40.160 --> 2:04:42.160]  one simple principle
[2:04:42.160 --> 2:04:44.160]  and one simple religion.
[2:04:44.160 --> 2:04:47.160]  Serial capitalism.
[2:04:47.160 --> 2:04:49.160]  What I used to do is
[2:04:49.160 --> 2:04:51.160]  serial angel-investor
[2:04:51.160 --> 2:04:53.160]  creating...
[2:04:53.160 --> 2:04:55.160]  Sure, it's reinvention.
[2:04:55.160 --> 2:04:57.160]  It's always been on the cutting edge
[2:04:57.160 --> 2:04:59.160]  and that's what we don't have
[2:04:59.160 --> 2:05:01.160]  in the Democratic Party.
[2:05:01.160 --> 2:05:03.160]  Never once have they taught
[2:05:03.160 --> 2:05:05.160]  about serial capitalism.
[2:05:05.160 --> 2:05:07.160]  Not once have they talked about
[2:05:07.160 --> 2:05:09.160]  building companies that at the level
[2:05:09.160 --> 2:05:11.160]  that they should exist,
[2:05:11.160 --> 2:05:13.160]  not the transnational corporations,
[2:05:13.160 --> 2:05:15.160]  but the small mob.
[2:05:15.160 --> 2:05:17.160]  They're definitely waging war on this.
[2:05:17.160 --> 2:05:19.160]  What do you see happening to the Democrats
[2:05:19.160 --> 2:05:21.160]  even when, I agree,
[2:05:21.160 --> 2:05:23.160]  lose a selection?
[2:05:23.160 --> 2:05:25.160]  What do they do?
[2:05:25.160 --> 2:05:27.160]  They tell them out and then they blame
[2:05:27.160 --> 2:05:29.160]  the COVID hoax they've created
[2:05:29.160 --> 2:05:31.160]  on what created the collapse.
[2:05:31.160 --> 2:05:33.160]  Really, it was them.
[2:05:33.160 --> 2:05:35.160]  What happens to them?
[2:05:35.160 --> 2:05:37.160]  What happens to the Chinese communists?
[2:05:37.160 --> 2:05:39.160]  What happens to anybody
[2:05:39.160 --> 2:05:41.160]  when they arouse the crowd
[2:05:41.160 --> 2:05:43.160]  is the crowd eventually devours them.
[2:05:43.160 --> 2:05:45.160]  In the tale of two cities,
[2:05:45.160 --> 2:05:47.160]  what you'll have is the tale of
[2:05:47.160 --> 2:05:49.160]  the rise of this Democratic entity
[2:05:49.160 --> 2:05:51.160]  and then you will see it devour itself.
[2:05:51.160 --> 2:05:53.160]  Because
[2:05:53.160 --> 2:05:55.160]  they can no longer externalize
[2:05:55.160 --> 2:05:57.160]  the responsibility. We're here.
[2:05:57.160 --> 2:05:59.160]  That's the French Revolution.
[2:05:59.160 --> 2:06:01.160]  When you conjure the mob, it's going to eat you.
[2:06:01.160 --> 2:06:03.160]  Exactly correct.
[2:06:03.160 --> 2:06:05.160]  And that's why
[2:06:05.160 --> 2:06:07.160]  the leaders of the Democratic Party,
[2:06:07.160 --> 2:06:09.160]  for example, the head of the Democratic
[2:06:09.160 --> 2:06:11.160]  Congressional Committee,
[2:06:11.160 --> 2:06:13.160]  Sherry, a Democrat from Illinois,
[2:06:13.160 --> 2:06:15.160]  said that we are the longest standing
[2:06:15.160 --> 2:06:17.160]  democracy in the world
[2:06:17.160 --> 2:06:19.160]  and we stand by our democracy.
[2:06:19.160 --> 2:06:21.160]  And I said, lady,
[2:06:21.160 --> 2:06:23.160]  what are you talking about?
[2:06:23.160 --> 2:06:25.160]  We have never been a democracy.
[2:06:25.160 --> 2:06:27.160]  We are a republic.
[2:06:27.160 --> 2:06:29.160]  How many times do you have to learn that?
[2:06:29.160 --> 2:06:31.160]  How many times is a Democratic
[2:06:31.160 --> 2:06:33.160]  idiot like Nancy Pelosi
[2:06:33.160 --> 2:06:35.160]  have to understand we are a republic?
[2:06:35.160 --> 2:06:37.160]  That's why they have a job.
[2:06:37.160 --> 2:06:39.160]  They represent us.
[2:06:39.160 --> 2:06:41.160]  If we had a democracy,
[2:06:41.160 --> 2:06:43.160]  each one of us would have an internet
[2:06:43.160 --> 2:06:45.160]  and say, you're out.
[2:06:45.160 --> 2:06:47.160]  And that was exactly what Hamilton
[2:06:47.160 --> 2:06:49.160]  and Benjamin Franklin
[2:06:49.160 --> 2:06:51.160]  would do.
[2:06:51.160 --> 2:06:53.160]  They would rule everyone into mob rule
[2:06:53.160 --> 2:06:55.160]  and again, we would get the French Revolution
[2:06:55.160 --> 2:06:57.160]  2.0.
[2:06:57.160 --> 2:06:59.160]  Correct.
[2:06:59.160 --> 2:07:01.160]  And what they don't understand is that
[2:07:01.160 --> 2:07:03.160]  it's going to devour them very quickly.
[2:07:03.160 --> 2:07:05.160]  The extreme elements,
[2:07:05.160 --> 2:07:07.160]  the Muslim elements.
[2:07:07.160 --> 2:07:09.160]  That's my next question.
[2:07:09.160 --> 2:07:11.160]  As a socio-economic researcher,
[2:07:11.160 --> 2:07:13.160]  as a psychiatrist,
[2:07:13.160 --> 2:07:15.160]  as a long person
[2:07:15.160 --> 2:07:17.160]  of the state of the world,
[2:07:17.160 --> 2:07:19.160]  when they don't get delivered power,
[2:07:19.160 --> 2:07:21.160]  how do they then eat the Democrats?
[2:07:21.160 --> 2:07:23.160]  What does that look like?
[2:07:23.160 --> 2:07:25.160]  What it looks like is they take out
[2:07:25.160 --> 2:07:27.160]  their own leaders, number one.
[2:07:27.160 --> 2:07:29.160]  In this case, they're not going to kill their theaters
[2:07:29.160 --> 2:07:31.160]  because they're not that ruthless.
[2:07:31.160 --> 2:07:33.160]  Basically, the Nancy Pelosi's,
[2:07:33.160 --> 2:07:35.160]  the others, the Feinstein,
[2:07:35.160 --> 2:07:37.160]  the Schumer's and all of them
[2:07:37.160 --> 2:07:39.160]  will be replaced by the AOC's
[2:07:39.160 --> 2:07:41.160]  and by a whole bunch of new people
[2:07:41.160 --> 2:07:43.160]  with new representation
[2:07:43.160 --> 2:07:45.160]  which has no relevance
[2:07:45.160 --> 2:07:47.160]  to the growth of the merits.
[2:07:47.160 --> 2:07:49.160]  That to me would really kill the Democratic Party
[2:07:49.160 --> 2:07:51.160]  or push it into only a few cities.
[2:07:51.160 --> 2:07:53.160]  What comes out of that? The Republican Party
[2:07:53.160 --> 2:07:55.160]  splitting or a new populist party?
[2:07:55.160 --> 2:07:57.160]  Because we need two parties.
[2:07:57.160 --> 2:07:59.160]  We're going to have more than two parties
[2:07:59.160 --> 2:08:01.160]  because in effect right now,
[2:08:01.160 --> 2:08:03.160]  when the Constitution was created,
[2:08:03.160 --> 2:08:05.160]  we had two parties.
[2:08:05.160 --> 2:08:07.160]  But the founding fathers understood very clearly
[2:08:07.160 --> 2:08:09.160]  we would have a republic
[2:08:09.160 --> 2:08:11.160]  where we might have more than two parties.
[2:08:11.160 --> 2:08:13.160]  So as things get more complex,
[2:08:13.160 --> 2:08:15.160]  like five parties.
[2:08:15.160 --> 2:08:17.160]  Right, but it becomes more efficient.
[2:08:17.160 --> 2:08:19.160]  What happens now is that
[2:08:19.160 --> 2:08:21.160]  we're beginning to understand
[2:08:21.160 --> 2:08:23.160]  what we need and don't need.
[2:08:23.160 --> 2:08:25.160]  Ironically here, I trained at Cornell,
[2:08:25.160 --> 2:08:27.160]  Harvard, MIT.
[2:08:27.160 --> 2:08:29.160]  What's missing?
[2:08:29.160 --> 2:08:31.160]  Cornell can't bring in
[2:08:31.160 --> 2:08:33.160]  students to the class.
[2:08:33.160 --> 2:08:35.160]  So they're going to have financial problems.
[2:08:35.160 --> 2:08:37.160]  Did you see where Stanford and others
[2:08:37.160 --> 2:08:39.160]  are going to stop even doing entrance exams?
[2:08:39.160 --> 2:08:41.160]  Correct. I saw that.
[2:08:41.160 --> 2:08:43.160]  The tenured professors were getting rid
[2:08:43.160 --> 2:08:45.160]  of the nonsense that came out of
[2:08:45.160 --> 2:08:47.160]  all these so-called elite colleges.
[2:08:47.160 --> 2:08:49.160]  And guess what's happening?
[2:08:49.160 --> 2:08:51.160]  I've talked to all these young people
[2:08:51.160 --> 2:08:53.160]  in the South and they're interested
[2:08:53.160 --> 2:08:55.160]  in getting trades going to
[2:08:55.160 --> 2:08:57.160]  community college.
[2:08:57.160 --> 2:08:59.160]  They're not even interested in going to the University of Florida.
[2:08:59.160 --> 2:09:01.160]  And there's one university in Florida
[2:09:01.160 --> 2:09:03.160]  that charges 65,000 a year
[2:09:03.160 --> 2:09:05.160]  in Jacksonville. Can you believe that?
[2:09:05.160 --> 2:09:07.160]  Those days... I will do one more segment
[2:09:07.160 --> 2:09:09.160]  and give us your view before
[2:09:09.160 --> 2:09:11.160]  the rain comes in here about how the
[2:09:11.160 --> 2:09:13.160]  Renaissance is coming and what people
[2:09:13.160 --> 2:09:15.160]  can invest in in your humble view
[2:09:15.160 --> 2:09:17.160]  and what the future is. But I agree.
[2:09:17.160 --> 2:09:19.160]  I know people that have trades that
[2:09:19.160 --> 2:09:21.160]  more money than people that have two or three mainline degrees.
[2:09:21.160 --> 2:09:23.160]  So what happens to the old mainline degrees
[2:09:23.160 --> 2:09:25.160]  in this system? And where do you see this
[2:09:25.160 --> 2:09:27.160]  global COVID lockdown going,
[2:09:27.160 --> 2:09:29.160]  which people are resisting, but they're trying to still keep
[2:09:29.160 --> 2:09:31.160]  in place, pushed by the Chai comms
[2:09:31.160 --> 2:09:33.160]  with Fauci saying the Chai comms
[2:09:33.160 --> 2:09:35.160]  are who we get our orders from. Absolutely incredible.
[2:09:35.160 --> 2:09:37.160]  Stay with us. Final

[2:12:05.160 --> 2:12:07.160]  from
[2:12:07.160 --> 2:12:09.160]  the front lines of the
[2:12:09.160 --> 2:12:11.160]  information war
[2:12:11.160 --> 2:12:13.160]  it's Alex Jones.
[2:12:13.160 --> 2:12:15.160]  All right, Dr. Steve
[2:12:15.160 --> 2:12:17.160]  for this one more segment
[2:12:17.160 --> 2:12:19.160]  he's a psychiatrist he ran psychological operations
[2:12:19.160 --> 2:12:21.160]  he
[2:12:21.160 --> 2:12:23.160]  said regime changes you name it but I don't
[2:12:23.160 --> 2:12:25.160]  need to have a psychiatry degree to see
[2:12:25.160 --> 2:12:27.160]  mind control. The
[2:12:27.160 --> 2:12:29.160]  U.N. comes out they say China is the model
[2:12:29.160 --> 2:12:31.160]  Australia is choking women that leave
[2:12:31.160 --> 2:12:33.160]  their houses wearing masks they're saying 8
[2:12:33.160 --> 2:12:35.160]  weeks you can't leave your house
[2:12:35.160 --> 2:12:37.160]  universities all over
[2:12:37.160 --> 2:12:39.160]  the world are saying you have apps on your
[2:12:39.160 --> 2:12:41.160]  phone you can't leave the university
[2:12:41.160 --> 2:12:43.160]  for the entire semester if you do you'll
[2:12:43.160 --> 2:12:45.160]  be expelled or suspended
[2:12:45.160 --> 2:12:47.160]  now the governor has become a doctor I guess
[2:12:47.160 --> 2:12:49.160]  in Maine
[2:12:49.160 --> 2:12:51.160]  Dr. Sherry Timpani tweeted this out
[2:12:51.160 --> 2:12:53.160]  Governor Janet Mills says servers must now
[2:12:53.160 --> 2:12:55.160]  wear face shields upside down
[2:12:55.160 --> 2:12:57.160]  so their brother's directed up not down
[2:12:57.160 --> 2:12:59.160]  yes he wants you to wear
[2:12:59.160 --> 2:13:01.160]  dogcone peak insanity
[2:13:01.160 --> 2:13:03.160]  I wish this was a joke it's real
[2:13:03.160 --> 2:13:05.160]  clearly when cults start to
[2:13:05.160 --> 2:13:07.160]  implode
[2:13:07.160 --> 2:13:09.160]  they try to keep people on the reservation so as
[2:13:09.160 --> 2:13:11.160]  the authoritarian universities implode
[2:13:11.160 --> 2:13:13.160]  the big prestigious ones
[2:13:13.160 --> 2:13:15.160]  and as the blue states and blue cities do
[2:13:15.160 --> 2:13:17.160]  they're just recreating
[2:13:17.160 --> 2:13:19.160]  number one rule only talk to who we say
[2:13:19.160 --> 2:13:21.160]  we're tracking you don't leave the farm
[2:13:21.160 --> 2:13:23.160]  but I mean this is just outrageous
[2:13:23.160 --> 2:13:25.160]  what the hell is going on
[2:13:25.160 --> 2:13:27.160]  because I read where
[2:13:27.160 --> 2:13:29.160]  under the NIH in Fauci they've got
[2:13:29.160 --> 2:13:31.160]  Yale and a bunch of things
[2:13:31.160 --> 2:13:33.160]  psychiatry and psychology departments
[2:13:33.160 --> 2:13:35.160]  studying how
[2:13:35.160 --> 2:13:37.160]  to make the public submit and they're not
[2:13:37.160 --> 2:13:39.160]  even denying it and they admit
[2:13:39.160 --> 2:13:41.160]  it's all about us submitting
[2:13:41.160 --> 2:13:43.160]  and the Fauci admits that wearing
[2:13:43.160 --> 2:13:45.160]  the mask is about us submitting to them
[2:13:45.160 --> 2:13:47.160]  they're not even hiding it
[2:13:47.160 --> 2:13:49.160]  this is what is going on here
[2:13:49.160 --> 2:13:51.160]  what's going on here
[2:13:51.160 --> 2:13:53.160]  is pretty much the last
[2:13:53.160 --> 2:13:55.160]  phases of
[2:13:55.160 --> 2:13:57.160]  the democrat's
[2:13:57.160 --> 2:13:59.160]  the federal government
[2:13:59.160 --> 2:14:01.160]  as we know the left wing
[2:14:01.160 --> 2:14:03.160]  and what do I mean by that
[2:14:03.160 --> 2:14:05.160]  I don't see this as disastrous
[2:14:05.160 --> 2:14:07.160]  as a matter of fact I see this as pretty optimist
[2:14:07.160 --> 2:14:09.160]  number one
[2:14:09.160 --> 2:14:11.160]  Christian leaders have come out to the forefront
[2:14:11.160 --> 2:14:13.160]  and basically said
[2:14:13.160 --> 2:14:15.160]  to the state governors, Newsome
[2:14:15.160 --> 2:14:17.160]  we're going to pray on the beaches
[2:14:17.160 --> 2:14:19.160]  same thing in New Orleans
[2:14:19.160 --> 2:14:21.160]  same thing in the south
[2:14:21.160 --> 2:14:23.160]  so the leaders of this country
[2:14:23.160 --> 2:14:25.160]  are going back to what we originally were
[2:14:25.160 --> 2:14:27.160]  Judeo-Christian leaders
[2:14:27.160 --> 2:14:29.160]  in reaffirming the integrity
[2:14:29.160 --> 2:14:31.160]  of their citizenship
[2:14:31.160 --> 2:14:33.160]  number two is the pressure they're putting on
[2:14:33.160 --> 2:14:35.160]  is going to make it stronger if we resist
[2:14:35.160 --> 2:14:37.160]  correct
[2:14:37.160 --> 2:14:39.160]  and each time I want them to put more pressure
[2:14:39.160 --> 2:14:41.160]  because it allows them
[2:14:41.160 --> 2:14:43.160]  to self destruct and us to become stronger
[2:14:43.160 --> 2:14:45.160]  for example
[2:14:45.160 --> 2:14:47.160]  you and I have lasted 20 years
[2:14:47.160 --> 2:14:49.160]  we haven't gone down
[2:14:49.160 --> 2:14:51.160]  in the population
[2:14:51.160 --> 2:14:53.160]  that we address as a matter of fact
[2:14:53.160 --> 2:14:55.160]  we've gone up since 9-11
[2:14:55.160 --> 2:14:57.160]  so the more they attack us the better it is
[2:14:57.160 --> 2:14:59.160]  number three
[2:14:59.160 --> 2:15:01.160]  the notion that we have these elite
[2:15:01.160 --> 2:15:03.160]  universities with tenured
[2:15:03.160 --> 2:15:05.160]  professors who also
[2:15:05.160 --> 2:15:07.160]  have unions
[2:15:07.160 --> 2:15:09.160]  that's finished
[2:15:09.160 --> 2:15:11.160]  these are desperate unions
[2:15:11.160 --> 2:15:13.160]  trying to make the lowest level
[2:15:13.160 --> 2:15:15.160]  cult slaves
[2:15:15.160 --> 2:15:17.160]  that'll work a while but backfire so predict what's coming
[2:15:17.160 --> 2:15:19.160]  and how people position themselves
[2:15:19.160 --> 2:15:21.160]  for a successful good happy life
[2:15:21.160 --> 2:15:23.160]  I was involved with
[2:15:23.160 --> 2:15:25.160]  Jonestown and when I had
[2:15:25.160 --> 2:15:27.160]  to be flown there I couldn't believe it
[2:15:27.160 --> 2:15:29.160]  I didn't even have to leave the United States
[2:15:29.160 --> 2:15:31.160]  they self destructed and that's where the
[2:15:31.160 --> 2:15:33.160]  democratic cult
[2:15:33.160 --> 2:15:35.160]  party is going
[2:15:35.160 --> 2:15:37.160]  they're in the process of self destruction
[2:15:37.160 --> 2:15:39.160]  they do not understand what the republic is
[2:15:39.160 --> 2:15:41.160]  they do not understand what small
[2:15:41.160 --> 2:15:43.160]  businesses are
[2:15:43.160 --> 2:15:45.160]  they do not understand what serial
[2:15:45.160 --> 2:15:47.160]  entrepreneurs are
[2:15:47.160 --> 2:15:49.160]  they do not understand how to build the country
[2:15:49.160 --> 2:15:51.160]  we are based on business
[2:15:51.160 --> 2:15:53.160]  so we're reifying the notion
[2:15:53.160 --> 2:15:55.160]  of a man of business
[2:15:55.160 --> 2:15:57.160]  I don't care if he talks for
[2:15:57.160 --> 2:15:59.160]  15 hours
[2:15:59.160 --> 2:16:01.160]  because he has done more than any of the other
[2:16:01.160 --> 2:16:03.160]  Trump gets stuff done that's what matters
[2:16:03.160 --> 2:16:05.160]  exactly I don't care
[2:16:05.160 --> 2:16:07.160]  if he blows out Sean
[2:16:07.160 --> 2:16:09.160]  Hannity or he blows out
[2:16:09.160 --> 2:16:11.160]  any other person they're not relevant
[2:16:11.160 --> 2:16:13.160]  to us the TV stations
[2:16:13.160 --> 2:16:15.160]  are not relevant Hollywood is gone
[2:16:15.160 --> 2:16:17.160]  you've got a new entity called
[2:16:17.160 --> 2:16:19.160]  Netflix yes we're monitored
[2:16:19.160 --> 2:16:21.160]  but with all due respect Alex
[2:16:21.160 --> 2:16:23.160]  we have been monitored since
[2:16:23.160 --> 2:16:25.160]  FDR was in power
[2:16:25.160 --> 2:16:27.160]  and nobody said a word
[2:16:27.160 --> 2:16:29.160]  we've been monitored at the NSA
[2:16:29.160 --> 2:16:31.160]  from the 50's
[2:16:31.160 --> 2:16:33.160]  60's and 70's I knew telephone
[2:16:33.160 --> 2:16:35.160]  wires were going through the NSA
[2:16:35.160 --> 2:16:37.160]  the problem with all of that is not
[2:16:37.160 --> 2:16:39.160]  our problem it's the problem of the listener
[2:16:39.160 --> 2:16:41.160]  if you have a billion bits
[2:16:41.160 --> 2:16:43.160]  of information there's nothing you
[2:16:43.160 --> 2:16:45.160]  can do with it you're overloaded
[2:16:45.160 --> 2:16:47.160]  they've had thousands of articles that
[2:16:47.160 --> 2:16:49.160]  the big tech spies
[2:16:49.160 --> 2:16:51.160]  because that's bigger spying than the NSA
[2:16:51.160 --> 2:16:53.160]  they end up joining us by spying
[2:16:53.160 --> 2:16:55.160]  on us they hear how real we are
[2:16:55.160 --> 2:16:57.160]  and they go my god these are real people
[2:16:57.160 --> 2:16:59.160]  I'm going to join them and that's why they're having to
[2:16:59.160 --> 2:17:01.160]  like bring in new people do psychological
[2:17:01.160 --> 2:17:03.160]  programming but it's not working they just
[2:17:03.160 --> 2:17:05.160]  keep joining us exactly
[2:17:05.160 --> 2:17:07.160]  and what happens within their own
[2:17:07.160 --> 2:17:09.160]  Google the workers
[2:17:09.160 --> 2:17:11.160]  are saying look we don't agree with
[2:17:11.160 --> 2:17:13.160]  your position and this is what
[2:17:13.160 --> 2:17:15.160]  we want so what happening is
[2:17:15.160 --> 2:17:17.160]  a recapitulation of the
[2:17:17.160 --> 2:17:19.160]  revolt within big tech
[2:17:19.160 --> 2:17:21.160]  in other words big tech is the same
[2:17:21.160 --> 2:17:23.160]  dynamic as the Republic
[2:17:23.160 --> 2:17:25.160]  it just gets bigger
[2:17:25.160 --> 2:17:27.160]  it has internal conflicts
[2:17:27.160 --> 2:17:29.160]  so we had it easy too long
[2:17:29.160 --> 2:17:31.160]  this communist globalist assault
[2:17:31.160 --> 2:17:33.160]  is only going to make it stronger if we recognize the attack
[2:17:33.160 --> 2:17:35.160]  then don't give up and decide to fight
[2:17:35.160 --> 2:17:37.160]  correct but honestly
[2:17:37.160 --> 2:17:39.160]  communism is dead
[2:17:39.160 --> 2:17:41.160]  China is basically
[2:17:41.160 --> 2:17:43.160]  what would you call this thing then
[2:17:43.160 --> 2:17:45.160]  dysfunctional insanity
[2:17:45.160 --> 2:17:47.160]  what is it
[2:17:47.160 --> 2:17:49.160]  what I would call it is the end
[2:17:49.160 --> 2:17:51.160]  of an era it's the era
[2:17:51.160 --> 2:17:53.160]  of self-destruction
[2:17:53.160 --> 2:17:55.160]  where the universities went out of control
[2:17:55.160 --> 2:17:57.160]  the democratic party went out of control
[2:17:57.160 --> 2:17:59.160]  where our war machinery
[2:17:59.160 --> 2:18:01.160]  is no longer viable
[2:18:01.160 --> 2:18:03.160]  you've got to remember one other thing
[2:18:03.160 --> 2:18:05.160]  we have 2.2 million men
[2:18:05.160 --> 2:18:07.160]  who absolutely will do nothing
[2:18:07.160 --> 2:18:09.160]  we're no longer in kinetic warfare
[2:18:09.160 --> 2:18:11.160]  who stopped that
[2:18:11.160 --> 2:18:13.160]  Trump
[2:18:13.160 --> 2:18:15.160]  who said we're no longer going to be in Iraq
[2:18:15.160 --> 2:18:17.160]  and Afghanistan
[2:18:17.160 --> 2:18:19.160]  and Syria
[2:18:19.160 --> 2:18:21.160]  who wanted to have cyber communication
[2:18:21.160 --> 2:18:23.160]  and has an effective
[2:18:23.160 --> 2:18:25.160]  cyber attack system
[2:18:25.160 --> 2:18:27.160]  that nobody's even talked about
[2:18:27.160 --> 2:18:29.160]  because I have to know that
[2:18:29.160 --> 2:18:31.160]  General Nakasone is running
[2:18:31.160 --> 2:18:33.160]  a very effective
[2:18:33.160 --> 2:18:35.160]  cyber attack against China
[2:18:35.160 --> 2:18:37.160]  and other countries
[2:18:37.160 --> 2:18:39.160]  exactly so Trump got the globalist
[2:18:39.160 --> 2:18:41.160]  repenting us down in these wars to debilitate us
[2:18:41.160 --> 2:18:43.160]  and to secure Chinese rare earth minerals
[2:18:43.160 --> 2:18:45.160]  so Trump's obviously listening to some smart people
[2:18:45.160 --> 2:18:47.160]  I don't want to get those folks in trouble
[2:18:47.160 --> 2:18:49.160]  but who are those smart people
[2:18:49.160 --> 2:18:51.160]  what type of folks are they?
[2:18:51.160 --> 2:18:53.160]  they're people who are committed
[2:18:53.160 --> 2:18:55.160]  like you and I to the Republic
[2:18:55.160 --> 2:18:57.160]  they are the people who are willing
[2:18:57.160 --> 2:18:59.160]  to take all kinds of defenses
[2:18:59.160 --> 2:19:01.160]  and insults
[2:19:01.160 --> 2:19:03.160]  it doesn't matter to us
[2:19:03.160 --> 2:19:05.160]  but what he's looking at
[2:19:05.160 --> 2:19:07.160]  is the viability of entities
[2:19:07.160 --> 2:19:09.160]  in and onto themselves
[2:19:09.160 --> 2:19:11.160]  i.e. a business
[2:19:11.160 --> 2:19:13.160]  and putting government to that model
[2:19:13.160 --> 2:19:15.160]  what works, what's good, what's effective
[2:19:15.160 --> 2:19:17.160]  what's what helps
[2:19:17.160 --> 2:19:19.160]  correct well the model
[2:19:19.160 --> 2:19:21.160]  let me be very frank
[2:19:21.160 --> 2:19:23.160]  I have never been an aficionado of the constitution
[2:19:23.160 --> 2:19:25.160]  the reason for it
[2:19:25.160 --> 2:19:27.160]  it's outdated
[2:19:27.160 --> 2:19:29.160]  and what's happening now is we're coming
[2:19:29.160 --> 2:19:31.160]  into a new realism
[2:19:31.160 --> 2:19:33.160]  a hyper realism
[2:19:33.160 --> 2:19:35.160]  where the states become more important
[2:19:35.160 --> 2:19:37.160]  the devolution of power
[2:19:37.160 --> 2:19:39.160]  from the federal government I told you
[2:19:39.160 --> 2:19:41.160]  it's happening very quickly
[2:19:41.160 --> 2:19:43.160]  except for one thing
[2:19:43.160 --> 2:19:45.160]  that Trump is very strong as a president
[2:19:45.160 --> 2:19:47.160]  the subsequent president
[2:19:47.160 --> 2:19:49.160]  will never be as strong as Trump
[2:19:49.160 --> 2:19:51.160]  because now he will make sure
[2:19:51.160 --> 2:19:53.160]  we're independent
[2:19:53.160 --> 2:19:55.160]  we broke away from China
[2:19:55.160 --> 2:19:57.160]  our medicines are made in the United States
[2:19:57.160 --> 2:19:59.160]  our products are made in the United States
[2:19:59.160 --> 2:20:01.160]  so he's a strong leader to create the devolution of power
[2:20:01.160 --> 2:20:03.160]  back to the people but then like Washington
[2:20:03.160 --> 2:20:05.160]  George Washington
[2:20:05.160 --> 2:20:07.160]  the leader blows it up when he leaves
[2:20:07.160 --> 2:20:09.160]  no because he
[2:20:09.160 --> 2:20:11.160]  I'm saying he blows up
[2:20:11.160 --> 2:20:13.160]  the strong man arc time
[2:20:13.160 --> 2:20:15.160]  I'm just saying
[2:20:15.160 --> 2:20:17.160]  it will go on to Pence
[2:20:17.160 --> 2:20:19.160]  from Tamsa it will go on to Ivanka
[2:20:19.160 --> 2:20:21.160]  or Jared Kushner
[2:20:21.160 --> 2:20:23.160]  and we will remain a viable country
[2:20:23.160 --> 2:20:25.160]  and a great country
[2:20:25.160 --> 2:20:27.160]  I have no fear
[2:20:27.160 --> 2:20:29.160]  so we're almost out of time
[2:20:29.160 --> 2:20:31.160]  thanks for joining us let's come back next time
[2:20:31.160 --> 2:20:33.160]  and talk about the future as well
[2:20:33.160 --> 2:20:35.160]  www.StevenChinic.com amazing hour
[2:20:35.160 --> 2:20:37.160]  thank you so much we're gonna come right back
[2:20:37.160 --> 2:20:39.160]  with Deanna Lorraine who's a great reporter
[2:20:39.160 --> 2:20:41.160]  journalist and activist
[2:20:41.160 --> 2:20:43.160]  and we're looking to get her doing some reporting for us
[2:20:43.160 --> 2:20:45.160]  we want to expand a lot of our operations here
[2:20:45.160 --> 2:20:47.160]  especially through the election we're gonna have her in studio
[2:20:47.160 --> 2:20:49.160]  the answer to 1984
[2:20:51.160 --> 2:20:53.160]  is 1776
[2:21:01.160 --> 2:21:03.160]  info wars has been banned
[2:21:03.160 --> 2:21:07.160]  arrested
[2:21:09.160 --> 2:21:11.160]  attacked and threatened
[2:21:11.160 --> 2:21:13.160]  because we are effective
[2:21:15.160 --> 2:21:17.160]  the great awakening is here
[2:21:17.160 --> 2:21:19.160]  go to banned.video

[2:21:33.160 --> 2:21:47.160]  infowar.com
[2:22:03.160 --> 2:22:07.400]  the grid and get prepared and have storeable food if they can.
[2:22:07.400 --> 2:22:12.000]  And now everything I've warned people about is coming true because it was all in the Rockefeller
[2:22:12.000 --> 2:22:14.680]  Foundation documents like lockstep.
[2:22:14.680 --> 2:22:17.720]  This is the corporate planetary takeover.
[2:22:17.720 --> 2:22:22.640]  So yes, I stand by what I said 10 years ago, what I said a year ago, and what I said last
[2:22:22.640 --> 2:22:24.080]  week more than ever.
[2:22:24.080 --> 2:22:28.080]  Get your high quality storeable foods at infowarsstore.com, that's one of the key check
[2:22:28.080 --> 2:22:33.400]  marks of the checkboxes, you've got to have checked off, infowarsstore.com and their delivery
[2:22:33.400 --> 2:22:35.760]  is now one to two weeks.
[2:22:35.760 --> 2:22:38.400]  Get it before the next big rush comes.
[2:22:38.400 --> 2:22:43.400]  Take action, get the best storeable food at the best price now at infowarsstore.com and
[2:22:43.400 --> 2:22:46.640]  it supports the infowar.
[2:22:46.640 --> 2:22:50.040]  I'm going to say something right now, but it's one of the most important things I've
[2:22:50.040 --> 2:22:53.120]  ever said, so please listen very, very carefully.
[2:22:53.120 --> 2:22:59.160]  Donald Trump is not the reason they released COVID or had the lockdown.
[2:22:59.160 --> 2:23:03.760]  They already had this plan, the Rockefeller Foundation and Bill of Melinda Gates.
[2:23:03.760 --> 2:23:06.120]  It is beyond critical.
[2:23:06.120 --> 2:23:08.440]  It is life and death for you and your family to understand, no matter where you live on
[2:23:08.440 --> 2:23:15.200]  the planet, that this is a worldwide world government takeover on record that it's never
[2:23:15.200 --> 2:23:16.880]  going to end.
[2:23:16.880 --> 2:23:18.400]  The United Nations has admitted that.
[2:23:18.400 --> 2:23:22.520]  First it's a month, then it's six months, then they say, okay, it's two years.
[2:23:22.520 --> 2:23:24.160]  They're now saying two years.
[2:23:24.160 --> 2:23:27.720]  They're now saying you'll never go back to normal.
[2:23:27.720 --> 2:23:32.600]  No more gatherings, no more anything, constant force inoculations that they admit don't
[2:23:32.600 --> 2:23:33.600]  even work.
[2:23:33.600 --> 2:23:37.120]  And the way they say they work, they change your DNA.
[2:23:37.120 --> 2:23:40.200]  This is the culling of the planet.
[2:23:40.200 --> 2:23:43.960]  This is the beginning of a straight jacket being put on you before you're slowly tortured
[2:23:43.960 --> 2:23:50.320]  to death and killed, do you understand?
[2:23:50.320 --> 2:23:53.600]  We're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:23:53.600 --> 2:24:02.880]  There are, of course, those who do not want us to speak.
[2:24:02.880 --> 2:24:03.880]  You think?
[2:24:03.880 --> 2:24:04.880]  Just let me think.
[2:24:04.880 --> 2:24:09.480]  Even now, orders are being shouted into telephones and men with guns supposed to be on their
[2:24:09.480 --> 2:24:10.480]  way.
[2:24:10.480 --> 2:24:11.480]  It's Chancellor Settler.
[2:24:11.480 --> 2:24:12.480]  Damn it.
[2:24:12.480 --> 2:24:13.480]  Why?
[2:24:13.480 --> 2:24:17.880]  Because while the truncheon may be used at lieu of conversation, words will always retain
[2:24:17.880 --> 2:24:18.880]  their power.
[2:24:18.880 --> 2:24:23.920]  Words offer the means to meaning, and for those who will listen, the enunciation of
[2:24:23.920 --> 2:24:24.920]  the truth.
[2:24:24.920 --> 2:24:30.120]  The truth is, there is something terribly wrong with this country, isn't there?
[2:24:30.120 --> 2:24:31.120]  You decided, sir.
[2:24:31.120 --> 2:24:32.120]  You wanted it foolproof.
[2:24:32.120 --> 2:24:33.760]  You told me every television in London.
[2:24:33.760 --> 2:24:37.640]  Cruelty and injustice, intolerance and oppression.
[2:24:37.640 --> 2:24:41.920]  And where once you had the freedom to object and don't think and speak as you saw fit,
[2:24:41.920 --> 2:24:46.480]  you now have senses and systems of surveillance, coercing your conformity and submissibility.
[2:24:46.480 --> 2:24:49.480]  In your submachine, how did this happen?
[2:24:49.480 --> 2:24:50.480]  Who's to blame?
[2:24:50.480 --> 2:24:54.680]  Well, certainly there are those who are more responsible than others.
[2:24:54.680 --> 2:24:59.040]  They will be held accountable, but again, truth be told, if you're looking for the
[2:24:59.040 --> 2:25:03.200]  guilty, you need only look into a mirror.
[2:25:03.200 --> 2:25:05.200]  I know why you did it.
[2:25:05.200 --> 2:25:06.200]  I know you were afraid.
[2:25:06.200 --> 2:25:07.200]  Who would it be?
[2:25:07.200 --> 2:25:08.200]  War, terror and disease?
[2:25:08.200 --> 2:25:15.600]  There were a myriad of problems which conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your
[2:25:15.600 --> 2:25:16.600]  common sense.
[2:25:16.600 --> 2:25:22.080]  Fear got the best of you, and in your panic, you turned to the now high chancellor, Adam
[2:25:22.080 --> 2:25:23.080]  Sutler.
[2:25:23.080 --> 2:25:26.160]  He promised you order, he promised you peace.
[2:25:26.160 --> 2:25:36.560]  And all he demanded in return was your silent, obedient consent.
[2:25:36.560 --> 2:25:38.200]  There is a war.
[2:25:38.200 --> 2:25:40.000]  It's happening now.
[2:25:40.000 --> 2:25:42.360]  It will decide the fate of humanity.
[2:25:42.360 --> 2:25:44.440]  The time to choose sides has come.
[2:25:44.440 --> 2:25:45.440]  We are the resistance.
[2:25:45.440 --> 2:25:46.440]  We are the Info-War.
[2:25:46.440 --> 2:25:47.440]  Taking back America.
[2:25:47.440 --> 2:25:48.440]  That can be the end of a show.
[2:25:48.440 --> 2:25:49.440]  But that's the end of our book.
[2:25:49.440 --> 2:25:52.440]  Daniel Lorraine, the top show host, author, ran for Congress up against Pelosi, did a
[2:25:52.440 --> 2:25:53.440]  great job.
[2:25:53.440 --> 2:26:05.440]  And he's here with us in studio for the next few days to get to have her.
[2:26:05.440 --> 2:26:07.440]  Thanks, Alex.
[2:26:07.440 --> 2:26:11.980]  So for the next few days, good to have her.
[2:26:11.980 --> 2:26:13.240]  Thanks, Alex.
[2:26:13.240 --> 2:26:15.280]  Well, you're going to be hosting part of the next hour,
[2:26:15.280 --> 2:26:16.880]  because I mean, you can host the whole hour if you want,
[2:26:16.880 --> 2:26:18.080]  but I'll be happy to do it if you want.
[2:26:18.080 --> 2:26:19.640]  OK, stick with me for a little bit.
[2:26:19.640 --> 2:26:20.480]  No, we're going to do it.
[2:26:20.480 --> 2:26:22.760]  You wanted to get into the train wreck that was last night.
[2:26:22.760 --> 2:26:23.240]  Yeah.
[2:26:23.240 --> 2:26:24.840]  So we'll start doing that next segment.
[2:26:24.840 --> 2:26:27.480]  But first off, what do you make of Steve Bannon
[2:26:27.480 --> 2:26:28.800]  getting indicted?
[2:26:28.800 --> 2:26:30.040]  That's pretty crazy.
[2:26:30.040 --> 2:26:31.960]  I mean, again, there's so many people
[2:26:31.960 --> 2:26:34.120]  that need to actually be indicted.
[2:26:34.120 --> 2:26:34.440]  Right?
[2:26:34.440 --> 2:26:35.920]  There's Hillary Clinton.
[2:26:35.920 --> 2:26:37.320]  There's James Comey.
[2:26:37.320 --> 2:26:39.200]  There are so many people that are walking freely
[2:26:39.200 --> 2:26:40.840]  that should not be walking freely,
[2:26:40.840 --> 2:26:44.440]  and yet Steve Bannon gets indicted
[2:26:44.440 --> 2:26:48.600]  for potentially misusing funds or money laundering.
[2:26:48.600 --> 2:26:49.600]  So I don't really know.
[2:26:49.600 --> 2:26:51.160]  I haven't looked into it too much,
[2:26:51.160 --> 2:26:54.120]  but I hope that there's nothing there.
[2:26:54.120 --> 2:26:57.040]  But I mean, I guess we're going to find out.
[2:26:57.040 --> 2:26:59.560]  Yeah, I don't like Steve Bannon, but I totally agree with you.
[2:26:59.560 --> 2:27:01.960]  I had Dr. Steve Pachinico, who's been actually a spy master,
[2:27:01.960 --> 2:27:05.000]  spy chief, overthrew at least five governments on record.
[2:27:05.000 --> 2:27:06.800]  I mean, you did Camp David Accords.
[2:27:06.800 --> 2:27:08.760]  I mean, co-founded Delta Force.
[2:27:08.760 --> 2:27:10.480]  That's a real master spy.
[2:27:10.480 --> 2:27:14.000]  And he's just disgusted by Bannon being such a phony.
[2:27:14.000 --> 2:27:15.760]  Nothing's people in the Navy, but he never even
[2:27:15.760 --> 2:27:17.160]  did anything really in the Navy.
[2:27:17.160 --> 2:27:19.040]  And then he's this con man.
[2:27:19.040 --> 2:27:21.760]  And Pachinico has really been gunning for him for a while,
[2:27:21.760 --> 2:27:23.080]  saying he should be indicted.
[2:27:23.080 --> 2:27:24.400]  So it looks like that's happened.
[2:27:24.400 --> 2:27:26.120]  I just don't like the NRA.
[2:27:26.120 --> 2:27:27.720]  New York going after the NRA.
[2:27:27.720 --> 2:27:29.760]  Like, oh, they flew on private jets.
[2:27:29.760 --> 2:27:31.760]  It's the oldest civil rights movement in the country.
[2:27:31.760 --> 2:27:33.120]  They fly around to major events.
[2:27:33.120 --> 2:27:34.440]  How do you think they do it?
[2:27:34.440 --> 2:27:36.800]  You put 15 NRA executives on a private jet.
[2:27:36.800 --> 2:27:38.240]  It's cheaper than flying commercial.
[2:27:38.240 --> 2:27:40.520]  You know, this idea that, oh, the Democrats
[2:27:40.520 --> 2:27:42.320]  are going to make sure the money's distributed.
[2:27:42.320 --> 2:27:45.920]  Oh, and a three-year program raised $25 million.
[2:27:45.920 --> 2:27:47.280]  That was the last time I checked.
[2:27:47.280 --> 2:27:48.240]  See what that group raised.
[2:27:48.240 --> 2:27:49.560]  I think it's over $25 million.
[2:27:49.560 --> 2:27:54.360]  The three executives got paid $200,000 over three years.
[2:27:54.360 --> 2:27:57.560]  I mean, again, they act like private groups
[2:27:57.560 --> 2:27:59.320]  collecting money and doing stuff that we're not
[2:27:59.320 --> 2:28:00.360]  supposed to get paid.
[2:28:00.360 --> 2:28:01.520]  It's a load of crap.
[2:28:01.520 --> 2:28:02.840]  I don't want to defend Bannon because I
[2:28:02.840 --> 2:28:04.000]  know he's a piece of garbage.
[2:28:04.000 --> 2:28:04.840]  Right, and he is.
[2:28:04.840 --> 2:28:06.400]  And he's a phony, and we know that.
[2:28:06.400 --> 2:28:07.240]  But the same time.
[2:28:07.240 --> 2:28:08.160]  But it's a dangerous president.
[2:28:08.160 --> 2:28:09.520]  Yeah, it's a dangerous president.
[2:28:09.520 --> 2:28:13.360]  And again, it shows the justice for one side only.
[2:28:13.360 --> 2:28:16.160]  Honestly, over and over again, why are these people
[2:28:16.160 --> 2:28:17.000]  walking freely?
[2:28:17.000 --> 2:28:19.440]  And why does it take such a short amount of time
[2:28:19.440 --> 2:28:22.360]  to indict these individuals on the conservative side,
[2:28:22.360 --> 2:28:25.080]  but yet on the liberal side, on the left, the Marxists,
[2:28:25.080 --> 2:28:26.400]  the Deep State, nothing?
[2:28:26.400 --> 2:28:28.280]  We've known about Hillary's emails for 10 years.
[2:28:28.280 --> 2:28:29.720]  Yes, yes, exactly.
[2:28:29.720 --> 2:28:30.880]  And the Wiener laptop.
[2:28:30.880 --> 2:28:32.280]  Why is there just nothing doing?
[2:28:32.280 --> 2:28:34.400]  And I don't know if President Trump is waiting
[2:28:34.400 --> 2:28:35.400]  till after the election.
[2:28:35.400 --> 2:28:36.480]  I heard some stuff about that.
[2:28:36.480 --> 2:28:38.280]  But I think before the election is when
[2:28:38.280 --> 2:28:39.440]  he needs to drop the hammer on this.
[2:28:39.440 --> 2:28:41.400]  Well, we've been here two weeks for three years.
[2:28:41.400 --> 2:28:43.480]  But at least they've gone after this Klein
[2:28:43.480 --> 2:28:49.680]  Smith, who falsified a document with a known CIA agent
[2:28:49.680 --> 2:28:51.760]  to then say, oh, this guy met with the Russians.
[2:28:51.760 --> 2:28:52.600]  He works for Trump.
[2:28:52.600 --> 2:28:55.880]  When he was sent by the CIA to infiltrate Trump,
[2:28:55.880 --> 2:28:57.240]  and I said it at the time, I thought
[2:28:57.240 --> 2:28:58.080]  he was infiltrating him.
[2:28:58.080 --> 2:28:58.960]  Maybe I was wrong.
[2:28:58.960 --> 2:29:01.240]  And to infiltrate the Russians.
[2:29:01.240 --> 2:29:02.600]  So I mean, this is dirty.
[2:29:02.600 --> 2:29:03.280]  This is dirty.
[2:29:03.280 --> 2:29:04.400]  It's super dirty.
[2:29:04.400 --> 2:29:05.920]  But that's what's going to happen.
[2:29:05.920 --> 2:29:07.920]  It's only going to be one side only.
[2:29:07.920 --> 2:29:10.280]  And I think more is coming out.
[2:29:10.280 --> 2:29:12.360]  Honestly, Trump keeps on tweeting,
[2:29:12.360 --> 2:29:15.760]  Obamagate, Obamagate, Obamagate, law and order.
[2:29:15.760 --> 2:29:17.520]  But I think a lot of his base are
[2:29:17.520 --> 2:29:19.080]  tired of seeing the tweets and the talk.
[2:29:19.080 --> 2:29:21.520]  We just want to see action and we want to see justice.
[2:29:21.520 --> 2:29:24.320]  And we're tired of seeing like it's a hopeless situation.
[2:29:24.320 --> 2:29:25.440]  Well, you said it perfectly.
[2:29:25.440 --> 2:29:28.200]  If they've indicted 100 Clinton conspirators and Hillary
[2:29:28.200 --> 2:29:30.360]  was indicted, I'm like, oh, go ahead.
[2:29:30.360 --> 2:29:31.320]  You have credibility now.
[2:29:31.320 --> 2:29:33.840]  You indicted Steve Bannon, who I know is a liar.
[2:29:33.840 --> 2:29:34.360]  Right.
[2:29:34.360 --> 2:29:36.400]  I mean, the way he went to the Senate Intelligence Committee
[2:29:36.400 --> 2:29:39.440]  and said, Roger Stone has no connection to WikiLeaks.
[2:29:39.440 --> 2:29:41.560]  He has no connection to him.
[2:29:41.560 --> 2:29:44.160]  And then he goes and tells a few years later, oh, yeah,
[2:29:44.160 --> 2:29:44.640]  I was there.
[2:29:44.640 --> 2:29:47.240]  He basically was our conduit to WikiLeaks
[2:29:47.240 --> 2:29:49.040]  and helped get him convicted.
[2:29:49.040 --> 2:29:51.440]  People say, why do you keep defending Roger Stone?
[2:29:51.440 --> 2:29:53.160]  Because Roger didn't do anything wrong.
[2:29:53.160 --> 2:29:54.520]  He did nothing wrong.
[2:29:54.520 --> 2:29:55.800]  And why would Bannon do that?
[2:29:55.800 --> 2:29:57.240]  Why would he throw him under the bus
[2:29:57.240 --> 2:29:58.440]  like that at the last hour?
[2:29:58.440 --> 2:30:01.240]  Because he has a lot of skeletons in his closet
[2:30:01.240 --> 2:30:02.040]  for a lot of corrupt.
[2:30:02.040 --> 2:30:03.840]  I mean, he was hanging out with Epstein
[2:30:03.840 --> 2:30:06.320]  after Epstein just before Epstein got arrested again
[2:30:06.320 --> 2:30:07.760]  right before.
[2:30:07.760 --> 2:30:09.840]  So I mean, he's just involved with a bunch of dirt.
[2:30:09.840 --> 2:30:10.320]  Yeah.
[2:30:10.320 --> 2:30:10.840]  Yeah.
[2:30:10.840 --> 2:30:12.680]  And that's what happens when these people flip
[2:30:12.680 --> 2:30:13.960]  at the last minute, right?
[2:30:13.960 --> 2:30:16.640]  We realize, OK, they've got skeletons in their closet.
[2:30:16.640 --> 2:30:19.160]  They're getting bought and paid for.
[2:30:19.160 --> 2:30:22.320]  And really, President Trump and just a few other people
[2:30:22.320 --> 2:30:24.280]  are seeming like the only ones that have not
[2:30:24.280 --> 2:30:25.600]  been bought and paid for.
[2:30:25.600 --> 2:30:28.080]  They're not compromised.
[2:30:28.080 --> 2:30:30.600]  Deanna Lorraine is here with us in studio.
[2:30:30.600 --> 2:30:32.040]  What got you politically involved?
[2:30:32.040 --> 2:30:33.440]  What got you activated?
[2:30:33.440 --> 2:30:34.760]  Honestly, it was.
[2:30:34.760 --> 2:30:36.480]  I was never a political person before.
[2:30:36.480 --> 2:30:38.560]  I came from a Republican family,
[2:30:38.560 --> 2:30:41.200]  hardworking business owners, Catholic.
[2:30:41.200 --> 2:30:43.640]  But it wasn't until the last couple years of Obama's
[2:30:43.640 --> 2:30:45.920]  presidency that I thought, man, there's
[2:30:45.920 --> 2:30:47.880]  something really wrong with this country.
[2:30:47.880 --> 2:30:50.720]  And there's something really wrong with this president, right?
[2:30:50.720 --> 2:30:53.760]  He's either intentionally destructive.
[2:30:53.760 --> 2:30:55.800]  He's either really, really stupid because I
[2:30:55.800 --> 2:30:58.240]  saw him making just the most stupid decisions ever.
[2:30:58.240 --> 2:31:00.880]  Or he is intentionally destroying this country.
[2:31:00.880 --> 2:31:01.960]  Which one is it?
[2:31:01.960 --> 2:31:04.480]  And from there, I went on and started researching.
[2:31:04.480 --> 2:31:05.400]  I got involved.
[2:31:05.400 --> 2:31:07.960]  I started researching Dinesh D'Souza's books.
[2:31:07.960 --> 2:31:09.400]  You, I started watching you.
[2:31:09.400 --> 2:31:10.680]  You woke me up a lot.
[2:31:10.680 --> 2:31:12.440]  And then I was going down different rabbit holes
[2:31:12.440 --> 2:31:15.880]  and realized, wow, there is a whole deep state situation
[2:31:15.880 --> 2:31:16.360]  going on.
[2:31:16.360 --> 2:31:18.400]  There's a whole shadow government going on.
[2:31:18.400 --> 2:31:20.040]  There's this thing called Marxism
[2:31:20.040 --> 2:31:22.400]  that's destroying our country and our family unit,
[2:31:22.400 --> 2:31:24.440]  removing God from our culture.
[2:31:24.440 --> 2:31:26.280]  So it was a fact that you were under threat
[2:31:26.280 --> 2:31:28.040]  and could see it as a smart person.
[2:31:28.040 --> 2:31:29.360]  You had to get mobilized.
[2:31:29.360 --> 2:31:29.840]  Absolutely.
[2:31:29.840 --> 2:31:31.120]  Whereas you got involved in media
[2:31:31.120 --> 2:31:31.800]  because you really cared.
[2:31:31.800 --> 2:31:32.800]  It's like I did.
[2:31:32.800 --> 2:31:34.720]  Almost all the Democrats literally get involved
[2:31:34.720 --> 2:31:36.120]  because they want to run things.
[2:31:36.120 --> 2:31:38.880]  But the last thing I want to do is tell people what to do
[2:31:38.880 --> 2:31:39.960]  and run stuff.
[2:31:39.960 --> 2:31:41.520]  I can barely run my own life.
[2:31:41.520 --> 2:31:44.800]  But why do you think they have this craving to run people?
[2:31:44.800 --> 2:31:47.520]  Well, because it's an agenda, right?
[2:31:47.520 --> 2:31:49.120]  Not only do they want to run people
[2:31:49.120 --> 2:31:50.960]  and they want to run the system, but they
[2:31:50.960 --> 2:31:53.640]  know that we're easily controllable
[2:31:53.640 --> 2:31:55.800]  if they can break down the family unit
[2:31:55.800 --> 2:31:58.520]  and they could install this globalist one world
[2:31:58.520 --> 2:31:59.600]  government, right?
[2:31:59.600 --> 2:32:01.160]  We're easily controllable.
[2:32:01.160 --> 2:32:02.520]  It's about power.
[2:32:02.520 --> 2:32:05.240]  When we're sectioned off in a different sovereign nations,
[2:32:05.240 --> 2:32:06.760]  we're not easy to control, right?
[2:32:06.760 --> 2:32:07.760]  And there's really nothing.
[2:32:07.760 --> 2:32:09.280]  There's no power for them.
[2:32:09.280 --> 2:32:11.920]  What do you think of Big Mike?
[2:32:11.920 --> 2:32:15.120]  I think Big Mike, if they were smart,
[2:32:15.120 --> 2:32:16.840]  they would put her up because I actually
[2:32:16.840 --> 2:32:19.360]  think she would be a formidable opponent to President Trump
[2:32:19.360 --> 2:32:23.040]  knowing how crazy and gullible her constituents are.
[2:32:23.040 --> 2:32:26.160]  We're going to play a clip of Big Mike here in a moment.
[2:32:26.160 --> 2:32:28.360]  But seriously, I don't know what's really going on with her.
[2:32:28.360 --> 2:32:29.760]  Do I think she has a swinging?
[2:32:29.760 --> 2:32:30.480]  You know what?
[2:32:30.480 --> 2:32:31.200]  Maybe.
[2:32:31.200 --> 2:32:32.440]  I think she might.
[2:32:32.440 --> 2:32:33.720]  I think she might.
[2:32:33.720 --> 2:32:35.440]  But it does look suspicious.
[2:32:35.440 --> 2:32:37.240]  I mean, let's just be honest.
[2:32:37.240 --> 2:32:39.680]  I'd say this with a family audience and a woman in here,
[2:32:39.680 --> 2:32:40.760]  but this is true.
[2:32:40.760 --> 2:32:43.600]  There's videos of her where she looks like she's got a flaccid
[2:32:43.600 --> 2:32:45.200]  8-inch rubber snake in her face.
[2:32:45.200 --> 2:32:46.640]  Yeah, a flaccid one, too.
[2:32:46.640 --> 2:32:49.920]  So we're talking like a foot and a half long thing here.
[2:32:49.920 --> 2:32:51.880]  I mean, seriously, she's adjusting it.
[2:32:51.880 --> 2:32:53.040]  It's flopping around.
[2:32:53.040 --> 2:32:54.600]  It's halfway to the knee.
[2:32:54.600 --> 2:32:55.400]  It's flopping.
[2:32:55.400 --> 2:32:56.880]  And the word is, she's pitching.
[2:32:56.880 --> 2:32:57.840]  He's catching.
[2:32:57.840 --> 2:33:00.040]  And I'm not trying to be gross here.
[2:33:00.040 --> 2:33:01.320]  Everything about Obama's fake.
[2:33:01.320 --> 2:33:05.120]  He was the editor of the Harvard Law Review for three years.
[2:33:05.120 --> 2:33:06.240]  We have copies of it.
[2:33:06.240 --> 2:33:07.920]  He said, I'm born in Kenya.
[2:33:07.920 --> 2:33:08.400]  Well, he was.
[2:33:08.400 --> 2:33:11.360]  He was born in Hawaii to a famous communist
[2:33:11.360 --> 2:33:13.400]  pornographer his mother shot videos with.
[2:33:13.400 --> 2:33:14.400]  It's all confirmed.
[2:33:14.400 --> 2:33:15.960]  So they got wheels with the wheels.
[2:33:15.960 --> 2:33:18.400]  She might have put a rubber snake in her pants
[2:33:18.400 --> 2:33:20.200]  and all these things to mess with us.
[2:33:20.200 --> 2:33:22.480]  That makes sense, because they run PsyOps.
[2:33:22.480 --> 2:33:24.920]  Yeah, that would not be the biggest PsyOps ever
[2:33:24.920 --> 2:33:28.520]  perpetuated to have a woman as the first lady, but who
[2:33:28.520 --> 2:33:30.640]  is actually a man who is a transgender.
[2:33:30.640 --> 2:33:32.360]  I mean, wouldn't that be the biggest PsyOps?
[2:33:32.360 --> 2:33:33.640]  And everyone just believes it.
[2:33:33.640 --> 2:33:35.600]  Because they do stuff like that all the time,
[2:33:35.600 --> 2:33:36.880]  so I wouldn't put it past them.
[2:33:36.880 --> 2:33:37.360]  I agree.
[2:33:37.360 --> 2:33:40.280]  Joan, I'm going to admit that I'm actually a woman, folks.
[2:33:40.280 --> 2:33:42.200]  It's the opposite.
[2:33:42.200 --> 2:33:44.080]  I look like a man, but I look like a woman.
[2:33:44.080 --> 2:33:47.000]  We figure here, I'm actually a girl.
[2:33:47.000 --> 2:33:50.080]  How do you contest an election in the year 2020?
[2:33:50.080 --> 2:33:54.120]  Well, you trigger race riots, and you
[2:33:54.120 --> 2:33:55.920]  tell the blue states and blue cities
[2:33:55.920 --> 2:33:57.400]  when you're the speaker of the house
[2:33:57.400 --> 2:33:59.720]  that you are legitimately now the president.
[2:33:59.720 --> 2:34:02.240]  That's what she said on CBS News.
[2:34:02.240 --> 2:34:05.440]  And then you're going to have those blue states secede.
[2:34:05.440 --> 2:34:08.280]  Yes, that's officially called a civil war,
[2:34:08.280 --> 2:34:09.280]  ladies and gentlemen.
[2:34:09.280 --> 2:34:11.720]  And the Democrats are backed by the EU, Hollywood, the Chai
[2:34:11.720 --> 2:34:13.680]  comms, and the whole globalist system.
[2:34:13.680 --> 2:34:16.960]  This is treason with a capital T. And our federal government
[2:34:16.960 --> 2:34:19.080]  is so paralyzed with cowards, they
[2:34:19.080 --> 2:34:21.680]  won't even stand up against it and do anything,
[2:34:21.680 --> 2:34:23.880]  even though our president has been exposing it.
[2:34:23.880 --> 2:34:25.160]  But here's the bottom line.

[2:34:38.120 --> 2:34:40.080]  It will make a road warrior look like a cake walk.

[2:34:56.120 --> 2:34:57.920]  your lungs, your sleep.

[2:35:52.120 --> 2:35:53.960]  You hear that?
[2:35:53.960 --> 2:35:57.200]  That's the march of the United Nations
[2:35:57.200 --> 2:35:59.760]  and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation
[2:35:59.760 --> 2:36:03.240]  coming with their battle plan, psychological warfare
[2:36:03.240 --> 2:36:06.240]  operation with the forced inoculations
[2:36:06.240 --> 2:36:10.120]  and the permanent lockdown of civilization and society.
[2:36:10.120 --> 2:36:13.760]  They're outlawing people being able to get colds or the flu.
[2:36:13.760 --> 2:36:15.440]  They're creating artificial phobias
[2:36:15.440 --> 2:36:17.280]  for normal death that takes place.
[2:36:17.280 --> 2:36:19.560]  They're not even promising to have a cure to it all.
[2:36:19.560 --> 2:36:23.040]  They're just inflicting new phobias on everyone
[2:36:23.040 --> 2:36:24.560]  to bring in their planetary regime
[2:36:24.560 --> 2:36:27.280]  directed by the WHO.
[2:36:27.280 --> 2:36:30.440]  With vaccines that actually change your DNA
[2:36:30.440 --> 2:36:33.440]  and make you owned by Microsoft.
[2:36:33.440 --> 2:36:35.720]  It's a final frontier.
[2:36:35.720 --> 2:36:38.400]  It's the year 2020.
[2:36:38.400 --> 2:36:40.520]  It's not coming.
[2:36:40.520 --> 2:36:41.560]  It's here.
[2:36:41.560 --> 2:36:43.560]  And submission is blood in the water.

[2:37:49.920 --> 2:37:52.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:38:00.880 --> 2:38:04.040]  You found it, the tip of the spear.
[2:38:04.040 --> 2:38:07.600]  It is the Alex Jones show.
[2:38:07.600 --> 2:38:13.720]  There must be some kind of way out of here.
[2:38:21.720 --> 2:38:23.960]  There's too much confusion.
[2:38:23.960 --> 2:38:26.280]  The Inal Arrange here with us, you'll be hosting.
[2:38:26.280 --> 2:38:28.400]  Much of the fourth hour.
[2:38:28.400 --> 2:38:30.760]  Should look at the DNC convention last night.
[2:38:30.760 --> 2:38:31.960]  The clown show, you mean?
[2:38:31.960 --> 2:38:32.760]  The clown show.
[2:38:32.760 --> 2:38:33.800]  The clown show.
[2:38:33.800 --> 2:38:35.480]  But I said, hey, what do you want to cover next?
[2:38:35.480 --> 2:38:37.480]  You said, well, you checked in your hotel yesterday
[2:38:37.480 --> 2:38:40.320]  when you got here, and the lady will tell the story,
[2:38:40.320 --> 2:38:42.040]  and then we'll show that people are actually
[2:38:42.040 --> 2:38:46.120]  wearing cones of shame now under a governor's order.
[2:38:46.120 --> 2:38:47.040]  This is real, folks.
[2:38:47.040 --> 2:38:49.680]  This is not a joke, as they just try to get us to,
[2:38:49.680 --> 2:38:50.960]  what is the point of this?
[2:38:50.960 --> 2:38:56.600]  OK, I think that it's mockery and dehumanization.
[2:38:56.600 --> 2:38:59.360]  I think they're just trying to shove as much dehumanizing
[2:38:59.360 --> 2:39:03.280]  stuff down our throats to see how much will these idiots take.
[2:39:03.280 --> 2:39:05.400]  I think they're just seeing, well, these idiots just
[2:39:05.400 --> 2:39:07.600]  keep on accepting this and accepting this.
[2:39:07.600 --> 2:39:11.440]  They're going to literally walk around with a dog cone, OK,
[2:39:11.440 --> 2:39:13.120]  in public, and they're just going to take it.
[2:39:13.120 --> 2:39:15.480]  I think that's what they're doing and pushing it and seeing
[2:39:15.480 --> 2:39:17.800]  that the more that we take, the more ridiculous things
[2:39:17.800 --> 2:39:20.600]  that we take, the more they can push on us,
[2:39:20.600 --> 2:39:24.040]  because they know that the Psyop, the mental Psyop,
[2:39:24.040 --> 2:39:25.720]  is totally complete, right?
[2:39:25.720 --> 2:39:27.480]  Our brain cells are totally vanished.
[2:39:27.480 --> 2:39:28.920]  And by the way, that's not your opinion.
[2:39:28.920 --> 2:39:30.560]  It turns out they've got Stanford.
[2:39:30.560 --> 2:39:31.600]  They've got Yale.
[2:39:31.600 --> 2:39:34.200]  They've got them all doing psychological tests,
[2:39:34.200 --> 2:39:35.760]  testing to see what we'll do.
[2:39:35.760 --> 2:39:36.400]  Yep.
[2:39:36.400 --> 2:39:38.840]  Because once we'll do that, if you'll wear a cone of shame,
[2:39:38.840 --> 2:39:40.480]  you'll take a deadly inoculation.
[2:39:40.480 --> 2:39:41.120]  Oh, yeah.
[2:39:41.120 --> 2:39:41.760]  Yeah.
[2:39:41.760 --> 2:39:42.960]  And it started with the mask.
[2:39:42.960 --> 2:39:44.800]  Remember, it started with the mask,
[2:39:44.800 --> 2:39:48.240]  and it started with just an optional mask.
[2:39:48.240 --> 2:39:50.040]  Then they make the mask mandatory.
[2:39:50.040 --> 2:39:51.680]  Then they make the mask mandatory,
[2:39:51.680 --> 2:39:54.640]  and it has to cover your full face and nose.
[2:39:54.640 --> 2:39:58.000]  And now the eyes are bad, so a space suit.
[2:39:58.000 --> 2:39:59.480]  So tell people what happened yesterday.
[2:39:59.480 --> 2:40:02.360]  So yesterday, I'm at a nice hotel.
[2:40:02.360 --> 2:40:03.480]  This isn't like a cheap hotel.
[2:40:03.480 --> 2:40:05.280]  This is a nice hotel.
[2:40:05.280 --> 2:40:07.280]  I told them, don't get you one downtown, though.
[2:40:07.280 --> 2:40:08.920]  It's like another world down there, man.
[2:40:08.920 --> 2:40:11.200]  But it's a good one, but it's a nice hotel, right?
[2:40:11.200 --> 2:40:14.680]  And I'm going in round, and I just went to the restaurant.
[2:40:14.680 --> 2:40:17.080]  I went to ask the host as a question.
[2:40:17.080 --> 2:40:20.520]  I said, is the restaurant, what time does the restaurant close?
[2:40:20.520 --> 2:40:22.640]  And naturally, as I'm talking to her,
[2:40:22.640 --> 2:40:24.880]  I just pulled my mask down a little bit to talk to her,
[2:40:24.880 --> 2:40:27.240]  because otherwise it's so muffled, right?
[2:40:27.240 --> 2:40:28.360]  And she just yells at me.
[2:40:28.360 --> 2:40:29.840]  She said, put your mask on over your nose.
[2:40:29.840 --> 2:40:31.600]  Put your mask on over your nose.
[2:40:31.600 --> 2:40:34.360]  I said, you could just say, hi, how are you?
[2:40:34.360 --> 2:40:36.080]  Or you could be nice about it, but you
[2:40:36.080 --> 2:40:37.920]  don't have to scream at me about it.
[2:40:37.920 --> 2:40:39.480]  And again, as I'm saying, you don't
[2:40:39.480 --> 2:40:41.760]  have to scream at me about it in a nice way.
[2:40:41.760 --> 2:40:44.080]  She screams at me again, put your mask over your nose,
[2:40:44.080 --> 2:40:45.520]  put your mask over her nose.
[2:40:45.520 --> 2:40:46.480]  And I said, you know what?
[2:40:46.480 --> 2:40:47.840]  I can't do this anymore.
[2:40:47.840 --> 2:40:50.080]  I think that at least during this pandemic,
[2:40:50.080 --> 2:40:51.600]  I'm already wearing my mask.
[2:40:51.600 --> 2:40:52.960]  It's already dehumanizing.
[2:40:52.960 --> 2:40:54.600]  You can at least be nice.
[2:40:54.600 --> 2:40:57.520]  What happened to customer service during this pandemic?
[2:40:57.520 --> 2:40:59.040]  It's gone completely out the window.
[2:40:59.040 --> 2:41:00.440]  So how'd this end?
[2:41:00.440 --> 2:41:01.040]  All right.
[2:41:01.040 --> 2:41:04.480]  So I told her off, and then I couldn't really help myself.
[2:41:04.480 --> 2:41:07.400]  I did flip her off as I'm walking away.
[2:41:07.400 --> 2:41:09.800]  And I said, I'm going to file a complaint about you.
[2:41:09.800 --> 2:41:12.360]  Well, you should, because they said 2.5 million
[2:41:12.360 --> 2:41:14.720]  would die, then 2.2, then 1.7.
[2:41:14.720 --> 2:41:17.240]  And they used all the dead numbers of other people.
[2:41:17.240 --> 2:41:18.920]  And there's a lot of weird demonias out there.
[2:41:18.920 --> 2:41:20.680]  People always die, but it's a hoax.
[2:41:20.680 --> 2:41:21.440]  It's a hoax.
[2:41:21.440 --> 2:41:24.200]  And then they just sit there, but the left gets into it.
[2:41:24.200 --> 2:41:25.600]  Like, their submission is cool.
[2:41:25.600 --> 2:41:26.800]  No, it's not cool.
[2:41:26.800 --> 2:41:29.320]  People are dying from a motorcycle accident,
[2:41:29.320 --> 2:41:31.560]  and they're marking it as death from COVID.
[2:41:31.560 --> 2:41:33.440]  I've talked to paramedics before.
[2:41:33.440 --> 2:41:35.200]  I've talked to people who are on the front line,
[2:41:35.200 --> 2:41:37.200]  and they've actually seen this, right?
[2:41:37.200 --> 2:41:38.200]  Even on the plane yesterday.
[2:41:38.200 --> 2:41:39.400]  No, no, it's in the statistics.
[2:41:39.400 --> 2:41:41.000]  Most of the deaths are not from COVID.
[2:41:41.000 --> 2:41:44.880]  And see, that's the thing is, well, sorry, keep going.
[2:41:44.880 --> 2:41:48.840]  No, I mean, look, I was on the Australian news, right?
[2:41:48.840 --> 2:41:51.880]  A couple of weeks ago, the Australian Today Show.
[2:41:51.880 --> 2:41:54.560]  And as soon as I started getting into the real death
[2:41:54.560 --> 2:41:56.040]  numbers and the presumed death.
[2:41:56.040 --> 2:41:56.880]  They cut you off.
[2:41:56.880 --> 2:41:57.800]  And oh, yeah, they cut me off.
[2:41:57.800 --> 2:42:00.040]  And they said it was a bad feed, right?
[2:42:00.040 --> 2:42:02.040]  And I talked about the president of Tanzania,
[2:42:02.040 --> 2:42:03.840]  how he's actually a scientist,
[2:42:03.840 --> 2:42:07.400]  and he sent in non-human samples, testing a goat,
[2:42:07.400 --> 2:42:08.800]  testing a pop-up.
[2:42:08.800 --> 2:42:09.920]  And it comes back positive.
[2:42:09.920 --> 2:42:11.240]  You can't make this stuff up,
[2:42:11.240 --> 2:42:12.080]  but you can.
[2:42:12.080 --> 2:42:14.600]  They're making it up, and yet the PSYOP continues.
[2:42:15.560 --> 2:42:18.640]  I have a friend actually that tested for COVID,
[2:42:18.640 --> 2:42:20.520]  which I told her not to, but she's a liberal.
[2:42:20.520 --> 2:42:22.840]  So, you know, she tested for COVID.
[2:42:22.840 --> 2:42:25.400]  And after two weeks, they finally gave her her result
[2:42:25.400 --> 2:42:27.120]  after she chased them down.
[2:42:27.120 --> 2:42:28.040]  And you know what they said?
[2:42:28.040 --> 2:42:29.400]  She said, well, is there, like,
[2:42:29.400 --> 2:42:31.280]  what should I do with COVID now?
[2:42:31.280 --> 2:42:33.520]  Of course, she tested positive, they said.
[2:42:33.520 --> 2:42:34.680]  They said, oh, just, you know,
[2:42:34.680 --> 2:42:36.320]  take some ibuprofen and some water,
[2:42:36.320 --> 2:42:37.600]  and you'll know it out in a week.
[2:42:37.600 --> 2:42:39.760]  So ibuprofen and some water.
[2:42:39.760 --> 2:42:42.600]  And they admit most of the tests are false positive,
[2:42:42.600 --> 2:42:45.520]  are non-conclusive, because they geared the test,
[2:42:45.520 --> 2:42:48.360]  they're scientists, and then the more they test them,
[2:42:48.360 --> 2:42:50.440]  it's not about death now, it's about level.
[2:42:50.440 --> 2:42:51.280]  Right.
[2:42:51.280 --> 2:42:54.080]  So you're talking about a deadly pandemic, supposedly,
[2:42:54.080 --> 2:42:56.120]  that's going to shut down the whole world,
[2:42:56.120 --> 2:42:58.400]  and that's going to shut down our schools,
[2:42:58.400 --> 2:43:02.680]  and mandate vaccines, all for an ibuprofen and water,
[2:43:02.680 --> 2:43:03.680]  and you'll knock it off.
[2:43:03.680 --> 2:43:04.680]  That's what they're actually trying to do.
[2:43:04.680 --> 2:43:07.480]  You know, imagine if you had a virus so dangerous,
[2:43:07.480 --> 2:43:08.880]  so deadly, you have to be testing on the other.
[2:43:08.880 --> 2:43:10.200]  Right, and then what else?
[2:43:10.200 --> 2:43:12.840]  Imagine you got hit by a car, it's so bad,
[2:43:12.840 --> 2:43:15.480]  you had to be testing, oh, you were hit by a car.
[2:43:15.480 --> 2:43:17.640]  Like, when you get the flu or the cold, man, you know it.
[2:43:17.640 --> 2:43:18.480]  Yeah, exactly, you know it.
[2:43:18.480 --> 2:43:19.840]  And by the way, I don't make jokes about this.
[2:43:19.840 --> 2:43:22.640]  Like I said, six years ago,
[2:43:22.640 --> 2:43:24.360]  I devastated my mother to this day.
[2:43:24.360 --> 2:43:27.800]  Her brother, his son, they lived in the same ranch,
[2:43:27.800 --> 2:43:29.440]  across the street, my dad's uncle,
[2:43:29.440 --> 2:43:31.600]  they all died the month from the same pneumonia,
[2:43:31.600 --> 2:43:33.640]  and the hospital was full of dead people.
[2:43:33.640 --> 2:43:35.160]  They were like, we've never seen numbers like this,
[2:43:35.160 --> 2:43:37.720]  it was in local news, around the south, the Midwest,
[2:43:37.720 --> 2:43:38.880]  there's a mystery on this.
[2:43:38.880 --> 2:43:40.440]  That was a real pandemic.
[2:43:40.440 --> 2:43:44.040]  It was, you didn't see it on the national news,
[2:43:44.040 --> 2:43:46.560]  but this thing was planned to create the fear.
[2:43:46.560 --> 2:43:48.920]  Of course it was, and then my friend also,
[2:43:48.920 --> 2:43:51.320]  the same person said when they did the big Q-tip thing
[2:43:51.320 --> 2:43:54.680]  up her nose, the guy actually dropped it on the concrete,
[2:43:54.680 --> 2:43:56.520]  you know, it was in a parking lot when they did it,
[2:43:56.520 --> 2:43:58.360]  dropped it on the concrete, and she said,
[2:43:58.360 --> 2:44:00.240]  you know, shouldn't you do it again?
[2:44:00.240 --> 2:44:02.080]  And he said, oh no, no, it's nothing to worry about it.
[2:44:02.080 --> 2:44:03.400]  And she said, sure, did you love how they wear
[2:44:03.400 --> 2:44:04.840]  space suits in the parking lot?
[2:44:04.840 --> 2:44:05.680]  Yeah, exactly.
[2:44:05.680 --> 2:44:07.360]  It's like those drive-through haunted houses.
[2:44:07.360 --> 2:44:08.200]  Yes.
[2:44:08.200 --> 2:44:09.760]  They run up with chainsaws and everything, I mean.
[2:44:09.760 --> 2:44:11.680]  So you're gonna wear a space suit in the parking lot,
[2:44:11.680 --> 2:44:14.120]  but you dropped the Q-tip on the dirty parking lot
[2:44:14.120 --> 2:44:15.280]  with car oil and everything,
[2:44:15.280 --> 2:44:16.760]  and you're telling me that's gonna be after.
[2:44:16.760 --> 2:44:18.640]  Well, that's the thing is, most of the tests,
[2:44:18.640 --> 2:44:21.880]  the only test for if you've had an infection
[2:44:21.880 --> 2:44:23.960]  and then the chemicals you have from it.
[2:44:23.960 --> 2:44:26.040]  So if you've had the last few years bacterial
[2:44:26.040 --> 2:44:28.680]  or the last 10 years of viral, you get false positive.
[2:44:28.680 --> 2:44:31.960]  Again, they admit that Gates admits the test is a fraud.
[2:44:31.960 --> 2:44:32.800]  It does.
[2:44:32.800 --> 2:44:34.760]  And so, and now they're saying, he's trying to deny
[2:44:34.760 --> 2:44:37.840]  that he's interested in the micro-chip situation,
[2:44:37.840 --> 2:44:40.240]  but an article just came out even in May saying,
[2:44:40.240 --> 2:44:43.240]  it connected him saying that he has done this micro-chip.
[2:44:43.240 --> 2:44:47.120]  You know, MIT and Rice said, he's funding us at once it,
[2:44:47.120 --> 2:44:48.640]  and then he's got the patents for it.
[2:44:48.640 --> 2:44:49.480]  Absolutely.
[2:44:49.480 --> 2:44:52.240]  And the patent just happens to be 060606.
[2:44:52.240 --> 2:44:53.080]  Which you can't make up.
[2:44:53.080 --> 2:44:54.240]  No, you just can't make it up.
[2:44:54.240 --> 2:44:55.520]  Why do you, but it's not just that
[2:44:55.520 --> 2:44:57.240]  when a bunch of the patents are 666.
[2:44:57.240 --> 2:44:59.120]  Right, there's three of them that are 666.
[2:44:59.120 --> 2:45:00.200]  Why do they do that?
[2:45:00.200 --> 2:45:01.040]  Well.
[2:45:01.040 --> 2:45:02.440]  It's like some weird thing.
[2:45:02.440 --> 2:45:04.320]  Obviously, there's no coincidences, right?
[2:45:04.320 --> 2:45:05.760]  It's biblical.
[2:45:05.760 --> 2:45:07.200]  Well, any group, whether they're good or bad,
[2:45:07.200 --> 2:45:08.880]  like the Pentagon, the military, the army,
[2:45:08.880 --> 2:45:10.320]  when they killed you in Vietnam,
[2:45:10.320 --> 2:45:12.560]  and Operation Phoenix, they left an ace of spades,
[2:45:12.560 --> 2:45:14.760]  they just can't help but leave their calling card.
[2:45:14.760 --> 2:45:15.600]  Right, exactly.
[2:45:15.600 --> 2:45:17.240]  They can't help it because symbolism,
[2:45:17.240 --> 2:45:18.440]  they're all about symbolism.
[2:45:18.440 --> 2:45:20.120]  That's how they communicate with each other.
[2:45:20.120 --> 2:45:21.440]  They can't help it.
[2:45:21.440 --> 2:45:23.160]  And, you know, the other thing that's creepy
[2:45:23.160 --> 2:45:25.240]  is that he wants to connect that micro-chip
[2:45:25.240 --> 2:45:27.200]  with birth control because it's Bill Gates' plan
[2:45:27.200 --> 2:45:31.880]  to have 120 million women on birth control by 2020.
[2:45:31.880 --> 2:45:33.320]  So he's pushing that in with this.
[2:45:33.320 --> 2:45:34.360]  That's in the U.S. alone.
[2:45:34.360 --> 2:45:36.000]  In the U.S. alone, exactly.
[2:45:36.000 --> 2:45:37.200]  And the birth control pill,
[2:45:37.200 --> 2:45:38.480]  or the birth control micro-chip,
[2:45:38.480 --> 2:45:41.000]  is also used within a remote control.
[2:45:41.000 --> 2:45:43.280]  You don't think he's gonna get that remote control
[2:45:43.280 --> 2:45:44.680]  and shut it on and shut it off
[2:45:44.680 --> 2:45:46.360]  when the family planning is gonna be?
[2:45:46.360 --> 2:45:47.200]  I don't want someone else
[2:45:47.200 --> 2:45:48.360]  to have remote control to my body.
[2:45:48.360 --> 2:45:49.400]  No, thank you.
[2:45:49.400 --> 2:45:51.560]  I know, and you read this stuff,
[2:45:51.560 --> 2:45:52.880]  it doesn't even sound real.
[2:45:52.880 --> 2:45:55.280]  No, it's in a sci-fi movie, but it's real.
[2:45:55.280 --> 2:45:56.840]  And these gullible feminist women
[2:45:56.840 --> 2:45:59.040]  are so dumb, the ones wearing the pussy hats,
[2:45:59.040 --> 2:45:59.880]  that they're gonna be like,
[2:45:59.880 --> 2:46:00.720]  oh yeah, that sounds great.
[2:46:00.720 --> 2:46:02.320]  Let's be honest, when you go to one
[2:46:02.320 --> 2:46:04.000]  of these feminist rallies,
[2:46:04.000 --> 2:46:05.160]  I'm not trying to be mean to these women,
[2:46:05.160 --> 2:46:07.560]  but what did they do to these women?
[2:46:07.560 --> 2:46:08.400]  It's feminism.
[2:46:08.400 --> 2:46:11.040]  It destroys the soul from the inside out.
[2:46:11.040 --> 2:46:12.680]  And you see them and you're like, wow.
[2:46:12.680 --> 2:46:14.720]  You know, no wonder no one's really mean.
[2:46:14.720 --> 2:46:15.880]  And he's trying to do all these things
[2:46:15.880 --> 2:46:16.720]  where he's cool.
[2:46:16.720 --> 2:46:17.560]  I know.
[2:46:17.560 --> 2:46:18.400]  You know, it's not working.
[2:46:18.400 --> 2:46:19.720]  He's the most hated person on earth right now.
[2:46:19.720 --> 2:46:22.160]  No, I don't care if he wears pink sweaters.
[2:46:22.160 --> 2:46:24.480]  I don't care if Fauci wears a white lab coats
[2:46:24.480 --> 2:46:26.040]  in his parade around TV.
[2:46:26.040 --> 2:46:27.960]  These people do not care about us.
[2:46:27.960 --> 2:46:29.800]  These people do not care about us.
[2:46:29.800 --> 2:46:31.440]  And by the way, doesn't his wife
[2:46:31.440 --> 2:46:34.280]  look kind of similar to Big Mike too?
[2:46:34.280 --> 2:46:36.000]  There's something that they have in common.
[2:46:36.000 --> 2:46:37.320]  A lot of these elites seem like
[2:46:37.320 --> 2:46:40.400]  they have very manly looking wives, don't they?
[2:46:40.400 --> 2:46:41.720]  It's the inversion of reality.
[2:46:41.720 --> 2:46:42.600]  I don't know what it is.
[2:46:42.600 --> 2:46:44.360]  Yeah, they certainly,
[2:46:44.360 --> 2:46:47.960]  Hollywood doesn't promote feminine style women.
[2:46:47.960 --> 2:46:49.200]  They don't like curvy women either.
[2:46:49.200 --> 2:46:50.280]  They're scared of it.
[2:46:50.280 --> 2:46:51.560]  Yeah, not curvy.
[2:46:51.560 --> 2:46:52.720]  They don't want femininity.
[2:46:52.720 --> 2:46:54.960]  They want all about body positivity.
[2:46:54.960 --> 2:46:57.520]  So they're exchanging a healthiness.
[2:46:57.520 --> 2:46:58.360]  But it's true.
[2:46:58.360 --> 2:47:00.280]  Look, she has a male look to her eyes.
[2:47:00.280 --> 2:47:01.120]  She does.
[2:47:01.120 --> 2:47:02.520]  He has a very womanly.
[2:47:02.520 --> 2:47:03.360]  Right.
[2:47:03.360 --> 2:47:04.520]  That's why Gage is very off-putting
[2:47:04.520 --> 2:47:05.360]  because you look at him.
[2:47:05.360 --> 2:47:06.760]  It's like, that's a woman looking at me.
[2:47:06.760 --> 2:47:07.800]  An ugly woman.
[2:47:07.800 --> 2:47:09.040]  And then the way he walks to
[2:47:09.040 --> 2:47:10.720]  and carries himself with the pink sweaters.
[2:47:10.720 --> 2:47:11.680]  Which is these aliens?
[2:47:11.680 --> 2:47:12.520]  And I think that's what they are.
[2:47:12.520 --> 2:47:14.600]  I don't get into like flying saucers, actually.
[2:47:14.600 --> 2:47:15.640]  But let's get a level.
[2:47:15.640 --> 2:47:18.120]  As a human, my first thing is that's not a human.
[2:47:18.120 --> 2:47:18.960]  No.
[2:47:18.960 --> 2:47:19.920]  It's not just that he's a woman.
[2:47:19.920 --> 2:47:20.880]  Looks like a man.
[2:47:20.880 --> 2:47:23.000]  No, there's something wrong with these people.
[2:47:23.000 --> 2:47:25.280]  No, there's something very, very wrong with these people.
[2:47:25.280 --> 2:47:27.360]  And it's from the, again, it's from the inside out.
[2:47:27.360 --> 2:47:30.320]  I think when they trade, they make a deal with Satan, right?
[2:47:30.320 --> 2:47:32.720]  That we're gonna do some satanic work here on earth.
[2:47:32.720 --> 2:47:35.000]  They're exchanging their soul for it.
[2:47:35.000 --> 2:47:35.960]  Well, let's do that again.
[2:47:35.960 --> 2:47:36.800]  Show that shot.
[2:47:36.800 --> 2:47:41.160]  His gates is very feminine in his gaze.
[2:47:41.160 --> 2:47:43.760]  But then his wife is very male.
[2:47:43.760 --> 2:47:45.080]  Same thing with Obama.
[2:47:45.080 --> 2:47:47.600]  With Obama, you kind of, not even feminists,
[2:47:47.600 --> 2:47:49.000]  we're like space aliens.
[2:47:49.000 --> 2:47:52.400]  But then with Obama's wife, Big Mike, it's very male.
[2:47:52.400 --> 2:47:54.520]  You feel like, man, I'm just kind of a tough dude.
[2:47:54.520 --> 2:47:56.360]  I'm about to get ready to fight here.
[2:47:56.360 --> 2:47:57.920]  Oh yeah, yeah, you look at it and you think,
[2:47:57.920 --> 2:48:01.160]  what kind of a man would choose that as a wife?
[2:48:01.160 --> 2:48:04.080]  You know, a woman who looks more manly
[2:48:04.080 --> 2:48:05.880]  and is taller and bigger than him.
[2:48:05.880 --> 2:48:09.720]  I mean, Big Mike is taller and bigger than Barack.
[2:48:09.720 --> 2:48:10.640]  You know?
[2:48:10.640 --> 2:48:11.480]  I mean, would you,
[2:48:11.480 --> 2:48:13.320]  I don't think anyone would marry someone like that.
[2:48:13.320 --> 2:48:14.720]  I'm not being mean to really tall women.
[2:48:14.720 --> 2:48:16.360]  They should get a really tall man.
[2:48:16.360 --> 2:48:18.920]  Women, even they're very anatomically, very pretty.
[2:48:18.920 --> 2:48:19.840]  It's bigger than you.
[2:48:19.840 --> 2:48:20.680]  It's kind of weird.
[2:48:20.680 --> 2:48:21.520]  It is weird.
[2:48:21.520 --> 2:48:23.480]  I think it's kind of like dude-like, you know?
[2:48:23.480 --> 2:48:26.440]  I mean, I'm a petite woman, so I can't really complain.
[2:48:26.440 --> 2:48:27.280]  Stay there.
[2:48:27.280 --> 2:48:29.640]  We're gonna talk about all of it straight ahead.
[2:48:29.640 --> 2:48:34.640]  And hour number four, spread those links, Big Mike hates it.
[2:48:36.960 --> 2:48:38.560]  It was a sleeper product.
[2:48:38.560 --> 2:48:41.440]  It wasn't popular at first, but as people tried it,
[2:48:41.440 --> 2:48:43.760]  it's become one of our top five best sellers.
[2:48:43.760 --> 2:48:46.240]  I'm talking about the eight pack power stack.
[2:48:46.240 --> 2:48:49.360]  13 different pills filled with super nutrients,
[2:48:49.360 --> 2:48:51.320]  vitamins, minerals, and more
[2:48:51.320 --> 2:48:53.680]  that you take in the morning and one pack and at night.
[2:48:53.680 --> 2:48:57.960]  It's available right now at 60% off for a limited time
[2:48:57.960 --> 2:49:00.480]  and you get it with survival shield X2
[2:49:00.480 --> 2:49:01.960]  that's now back in stock.
[2:49:01.960 --> 2:49:04.520]  This has changed my life and so many other people's lives.
[2:49:04.520 --> 2:49:05.360]  Now here's the problem.
[2:49:05.360 --> 2:49:07.520]  Some of the patented ingredients
[2:49:07.520 --> 2:49:09.000]  that are in eight pack power stack
[2:49:09.000 --> 2:49:11.160]  because of the shutdown and the lockdown
[2:49:11.160 --> 2:49:13.440]  are not available for us to even reorder it.
[2:49:13.440 --> 2:49:17.040]  So this could be the last shipment that we ever have.
[2:49:17.040 --> 2:49:18.400]  It's in stock now.
[2:49:18.400 --> 2:49:20.880]  Take advantage of this new combo special,
[2:49:20.880 --> 2:49:23.560]  part of a larger cell we have and free shipping
[2:49:23.560 --> 2:49:26.200]  on these cell items like eight pack power stack
[2:49:26.200 --> 2:49:28.720]  and X2 at infowarstore.com.
[2:49:28.720 --> 2:49:32.200]  Take advantage and get eight pack power stack with X2.
[2:49:32.200 --> 2:49:35.120]  60% off and free shipping biggest deal on this ever.
[2:49:37.680 --> 2:49:41.520]  You can really break civilizations down to two types,
[2:49:41.520 --> 2:49:46.520]  predatory and non-predatory or oppressive conquest based
[2:49:46.600 --> 2:49:47.960]  or Renaissance based.
[2:49:47.960 --> 2:49:50.160]  And of course, different types of civilizations
[2:49:50.160 --> 2:49:53.720]  and countries and political systems of history
[2:49:53.720 --> 2:49:56.520]  and of the present are mixes of the two.
[2:49:56.520 --> 2:50:01.520]  But with globalism, it is a post human ideology.
[2:50:01.960 --> 2:50:06.160]  So it's scientifically geared to be oppressive
[2:50:06.160 --> 2:50:08.920]  and the rationale is social Darwinism
[2:50:08.920 --> 2:50:10.760]  that the ruling class are elites
[2:50:10.760 --> 2:50:13.600]  and because they're in power, they have a right to rule over
[2:50:13.600 --> 2:50:18.360]  you, poison you, dumb you down, sterilize you and kill you.
[2:50:18.360 --> 2:50:20.120]  So all the people wearing masks
[2:50:20.120 --> 2:50:22.560]  like outside at the park and stuff
[2:50:22.560 --> 2:50:26.200]  are living in a total hoax and think their act of submission
[2:50:26.200 --> 2:50:29.240]  is an act of working for the common good in a collective.
[2:50:29.240 --> 2:50:31.520]  No, it's a sign that you're a slave
[2:50:31.520 --> 2:50:33.480]  who will take the force inoculations.
[2:50:33.480 --> 2:50:35.280]  Federal government and Yale are studying
[2:50:35.280 --> 2:50:37.000]  the force inoculations right now.
[2:50:40.000 --> 2:50:43.080]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[2:50:43.080 --> 2:50:50.080]  I don't want to go down this rabbit hole of Big Mike,
[2:50:57.320 --> 2:50:59.960]  but it was the top thing a few days ago on Twitter.
[2:50:59.960 --> 2:51:02.080]  Deanna Lorraine's taking over at 15 minutes.
[2:51:02.080 --> 2:51:03.160]  She's here.
[2:51:03.160 --> 2:51:06.400]  And then the war room, I'll destroy your 3 p.m. central.
[2:51:06.400 --> 2:51:07.840]  But what's your gut level
[2:51:07.840 --> 2:51:10.080]  on what's going to happen with this election?
[2:51:10.080 --> 2:51:13.440]  I think that, you know, President Trump,
[2:51:13.440 --> 2:51:15.360]  I think, is going to clinch it,
[2:51:15.360 --> 2:51:18.920]  but it's not going to be easy, nor is it going to be pretty.
[2:51:18.920 --> 2:51:20.240]  If we think it's ugly now,
[2:51:20.240 --> 2:51:22.160]  it's going to get 10 times uglier.
[2:51:22.160 --> 2:51:24.000]  They're so desperate right now.
[2:51:24.000 --> 2:51:26.240]  And either way, whether he, if he wins,
[2:51:26.240 --> 2:51:28.200]  if he loses, it's going to be bad.
[2:51:28.200 --> 2:51:30.920]  I mean, this new normal, this dystopian new normal
[2:51:30.920 --> 2:51:34.280]  that we're seeing now, that's going to be our future 100%.
[2:51:34.280 --> 2:51:36.640]  And it's going to be ushered in really aggressively.
[2:51:36.640 --> 2:51:38.360]  And if he wins, though,
[2:51:38.360 --> 2:51:40.480]  it's going to be also massive civil unrest.
[2:51:40.480 --> 2:51:42.160]  Cause they're not just going to lay down quietly.
[2:51:42.160 --> 2:51:43.000]  You know, the deep state,
[2:51:43.000 --> 2:51:45.000]  they're not going to lay down quietly whatsoever.
[2:51:45.000 --> 2:51:46.080]  They're going to keep on going
[2:51:46.080 --> 2:51:48.240]  and it's going to create such a huge, you know,
[2:51:48.240 --> 2:51:50.160]  they're going to try to overthrow the results.
[2:51:50.160 --> 2:51:51.520]  They're going to try to contest it.
[2:51:51.520 --> 2:51:53.240]  They said they're going to have states to see.
[2:51:53.240 --> 2:51:54.520]  Oh yeah, exactly.
[2:51:54.520 --> 2:51:56.280]  Right. And try to sort of get the military
[2:51:56.280 --> 2:51:57.520]  to get Trump out of office.
[2:51:57.520 --> 2:52:00.960]  I mean, I mean, it's really scary either way.
[2:52:00.960 --> 2:52:02.560]  But I still think he's going to clinch it,
[2:52:02.560 --> 2:52:03.400]  but here's the thing.
[2:52:03.400 --> 2:52:04.240]  I think he needs to,
[2:52:04.240 --> 2:52:06.960]  he needs to not take his base for granted.
[2:52:06.960 --> 2:52:08.480]  He needs to energize his base.
[2:52:08.480 --> 2:52:10.440]  He needs to be that Trump that we know.
[2:52:10.440 --> 2:52:12.320]  I think he started doing that the last few weeks.
[2:52:12.320 --> 2:52:13.840]  Yeah, finally, finally, yes.
[2:52:13.840 --> 2:52:15.120]  But for a little while,
[2:52:15.120 --> 2:52:16.160]  I was getting a little nervous.
[2:52:16.160 --> 2:52:17.520]  I love President Trump,
[2:52:17.520 --> 2:52:20.760]  but, you know, I felt like his energy was kind of lower.
[2:52:20.760 --> 2:52:22.480]  And he was going along, you know,
[2:52:22.480 --> 2:52:23.720]  kind of with the COVID stuff.
[2:52:23.720 --> 2:52:26.280]  And I just want him so badly to just,
[2:52:26.280 --> 2:52:29.000]  to just blow the lid off the COVID hoax.
[2:52:29.000 --> 2:52:29.840]  Don't you?
[2:52:29.840 --> 2:52:30.680]  I just want it,
[2:52:30.680 --> 2:52:33.120]  I just want it totally blown off with evidence,
[2:52:33.120 --> 2:52:34.120]  with a parade of,
[2:52:34.120 --> 2:52:36.400]  I like with the Republican party chairman of Texas,
[2:52:36.400 --> 2:52:37.880]  a great former congressman,
[2:52:37.880 --> 2:52:39.760]  Allen West has come out and said,
[2:52:39.760 --> 2:52:42.600]  COVID is an overreaction and a bunch of hoax.
[2:52:42.600 --> 2:52:44.440]  Yeah, I mean, absolutely.
[2:52:44.440 --> 2:52:46.960]  And, you know, why is he still a Fauci in there too?
[2:52:46.960 --> 2:52:47.800]  That's the thing, you know,
[2:52:47.800 --> 2:52:50.000]  why doesn't he replace Fauci with some of the doctors
[2:52:50.000 --> 2:52:51.600]  from like the frontline doctors
[2:52:51.600 --> 2:52:53.440]  who actually know what they're talking about,
[2:52:53.440 --> 2:52:55.800]  who have actually treated COVID patients,
[2:52:55.800 --> 2:52:56.640]  hundreds of them,
[2:52:56.640 --> 2:52:58.000]  and with HCQ and everything.
[2:52:58.000 --> 2:52:59.920]  Trump is starting to do that.
[2:52:59.920 --> 2:53:02.040]  The media will give them no attention.
[2:53:02.040 --> 2:53:03.360]  They're not, yeah, they're not going to give them.
[2:53:03.360 --> 2:53:06.080]  Fauci went under the knife for a throat polyp.
[2:53:06.080 --> 2:53:09.360]  Yeah, I'm really happy with God that he came out of it.
[2:53:09.360 --> 2:53:12.400]  The actual photo of Fauci right there.
[2:53:12.400 --> 2:53:15.040]  There's a good one.
[2:53:15.040 --> 2:53:16.560]  I love that doctor though,
[2:53:16.560 --> 2:53:18.960]  that Stella Emmanuel, she's pretty cool.
[2:53:18.960 --> 2:53:19.800]  Oh yeah.
[2:53:19.800 --> 2:53:21.520]  But no, I mean, like, how could he,
[2:53:21.520 --> 2:53:25.800]  if he did like a two week long of COVID press conferences
[2:53:25.800 --> 2:53:28.000]  where he's forcing the public to watch him
[2:53:28.000 --> 2:53:29.440]  while he's blowing the lid up
[2:53:29.440 --> 2:53:32.160]  of the mass situation of the vaccines,
[2:53:32.160 --> 2:53:33.560]  over and over everything,
[2:53:33.560 --> 2:53:35.520]  every part of this hoax,
[2:53:35.520 --> 2:53:36.360]  wouldn't that be great?
[2:53:36.360 --> 2:53:37.600]  I mean, what's better than the president
[2:53:37.600 --> 2:53:39.200]  of the United States blowing the lid off of this
[2:53:39.200 --> 2:53:41.200]  because then other countries could follow
[2:53:41.200 --> 2:53:42.400]  that also want freedom.
[2:53:42.400 --> 2:53:44.760]  And one of the things I pinched myself on
[2:53:44.760 --> 2:53:45.600]  when I go in there and go,
[2:53:45.600 --> 2:53:48.040]  all these doctors have been banned off YouTube and Twitter
[2:53:48.040 --> 2:53:49.760]  for saying treatments they've done are successful.
[2:53:49.760 --> 2:53:51.920]  I can't even believe what's happening.
[2:53:51.920 --> 2:53:53.080]  They've got to be a banned off video,
[2:53:53.080 --> 2:53:54.400]  but they've really done it
[2:53:54.400 --> 2:53:56.080]  to hundreds of prominent people.
[2:53:56.080 --> 2:53:57.920]  How dangerous is that?
[2:53:57.920 --> 2:54:00.040]  It's really, really dangerous.
[2:54:00.040 --> 2:54:01.160]  And this is what's happening though.
[2:54:01.160 --> 2:54:03.160]  You know, this hoax continues.
[2:54:03.160 --> 2:54:04.080]  And as it continues,
[2:54:04.080 --> 2:54:05.360]  we live in more of a nightmare
[2:54:05.360 --> 2:54:06.560]  because they are, meanwhile,
[2:54:06.560 --> 2:54:08.440]  restricting our freedoms more and more.
[2:54:08.440 --> 2:54:10.440]  They're tightening the ratchet on us.
[2:54:10.440 --> 2:54:12.040]  The schools are reimagined.
[2:54:12.040 --> 2:54:13.920]  I mean, you've looked at the schools now, right?
[2:54:13.920 --> 2:54:17.080]  Like six kids to a class, a mask all day.
[2:54:17.080 --> 2:54:19.000]  They have to play alone with a ball.
[2:54:19.000 --> 2:54:20.160]  They can't even go to lunch.
[2:54:20.160 --> 2:54:21.520]  That's child abuse.
[2:54:21.520 --> 2:54:22.640]  They've been put into prison.
[2:54:22.640 --> 2:54:23.480]  Yeah, yeah.
[2:54:23.480 --> 2:54:25.680]  You've got the clip coming up where they,
[2:54:25.680 --> 2:54:27.320]  the two-year-old won't wear the mask
[2:54:27.320 --> 2:54:28.440]  when they're thrown off the plane.
[2:54:28.440 --> 2:54:29.280]  Right, exactly.
[2:54:29.280 --> 2:54:31.120]  The two-year-old is getting thrown off the plane.
[2:54:31.120 --> 2:54:31.960]  Look at this.
[2:54:31.960 --> 2:54:33.440]  The kids are being taught to be total prisoners.
[2:54:33.440 --> 2:54:34.680]  Right, this is so scary.
[2:54:34.680 --> 2:54:35.680]  This is such child abuse.
[2:54:35.680 --> 2:54:38.040]  You may have to imagine the psychological trauma
[2:54:38.040 --> 2:54:39.200]  these kids are experiencing.
[2:54:39.200 --> 2:54:40.040]  When they grow up,
[2:54:40.040 --> 2:54:41.520]  they're going to learn not to touch anyone,
[2:54:41.520 --> 2:54:43.480]  not to hug anyone.
[2:54:43.480 --> 2:54:44.800]  They're going to have to basically feel like
[2:54:44.800 --> 2:54:45.640]  they're wearing a scarf.
[2:54:45.640 --> 2:54:47.840]  Which statistically makes you incredibly unhealthy
[2:54:47.840 --> 2:54:48.680]  and suicidal.
[2:54:48.680 --> 2:54:49.520]  Oh, yeah.
[2:54:49.520 --> 2:54:50.800]  So they're going to be taught how to commit suicide?
[2:54:50.800 --> 2:54:52.200]  Yeah, they're going to be washing their hands
[2:54:52.200 --> 2:54:54.160]  every two seconds with hand sanitizer,
[2:54:54.160 --> 2:54:55.440]  walking around in a bubble.
[2:54:55.440 --> 2:54:58.160]  The other day I saw someone was carrying a child,
[2:54:58.160 --> 2:54:59.160]  like a one-year-old,
[2:54:59.160 --> 2:55:01.560]  and he had one of those big plastic bubbles around him.
[2:55:01.560 --> 2:55:04.360]  And I thought, wow, imagine going through your life
[2:55:04.360 --> 2:55:06.480]  with your eyes looking out at the world in a bubble.
[2:55:06.480 --> 2:55:08.400]  All because you follow the Democrat cult
[2:55:08.400 --> 2:55:09.440]  that's run by the Chycoms.
[2:55:09.440 --> 2:55:10.280]  Exactly.
[2:55:10.280 --> 2:55:11.120]  And look, notice it's Asia.
[2:55:11.120 --> 2:55:11.960]  What's up with Asia?
[2:55:11.960 --> 2:55:13.840]  They seem to be the spear tip of this.
[2:55:13.840 --> 2:55:16.600]  But meanwhile, they're like partying in Wuhan, right?
[2:55:16.600 --> 2:55:18.960]  A couple days ago at this big dance party
[2:55:18.960 --> 2:55:20.920]  and floatables in the pool and everything.
[2:55:20.920 --> 2:55:22.200]  Why aren't we partying like that?
[2:55:22.200 --> 2:55:23.720]  We can't even go to church now.
[2:55:23.720 --> 2:55:25.120]  We can't even sing in church in California.
[2:55:25.120 --> 2:55:26.600]  It was education and enclosure.
[2:55:26.600 --> 2:55:29.120]  It's all just to see what we will accept.
[2:55:29.120 --> 2:55:31.240]  What we will put up with, exactly.
[2:55:31.240 --> 2:55:34.200]  Like the kids in cages, these are kids in cages.
[2:55:34.200 --> 2:55:36.360]  Why aren't we talking about these kids in cages?
[2:55:36.360 --> 2:55:37.080]  How is that?
[2:55:37.080 --> 2:55:38.400]  You get me any such, huh?
[2:55:38.400 --> 2:55:40.880]  The Illinois Rains, stay right there.
[2:55:40.880 --> 2:55:41.380]  Ha-ha.
[2:55:45.440 --> 2:55:48.640]  Constantly, whether it's the New York Times, The Washington
[2:55:48.640 --> 2:55:50.560]  Post, or Howard Stern, of a blue name,
[2:55:50.560 --> 2:55:53.120]  and they come out and they attack him full-war saying,
[2:55:53.120 --> 2:55:56.720]  Jones claims civil wars coming, and financial collapse,
[2:55:56.720 --> 2:55:59.600]  and planetary lockdowns using viruses.
[2:55:59.600 --> 2:56:01.880]  And he tells people they should get off the grid
[2:56:01.880 --> 2:56:04.120]  and get prepared and have horrible food.
[2:56:04.120 --> 2:56:05.280]  If they can.
[2:56:05.280 --> 2:56:08.200]  And now everything I've warned people about is coming true,
[2:56:08.200 --> 2:56:10.640]  because it was all in the Rockefeller Foundation
[2:56:10.640 --> 2:56:12.480]  documents, like lockstep.
[2:56:12.480 --> 2:56:15.600]  This is the corporate planetary takeover.
[2:56:15.600 --> 2:56:18.520]  So yes, I stand by what I said 10 years ago,
[2:56:18.520 --> 2:56:21.200]  what I said a year ago, and what I said last week more
[2:56:21.200 --> 2:56:21.880]  than ever.

[2:56:36.240 --> 2:56:39.120]  Take action, get the best horrible food at the best price
[2:56:39.120 --> 2:56:41.280]  now at infowarstore.com.
[2:56:41.280 --> 2:57:06.120]  And it supports the infowar.
[2:57:06.120 --> 2:57:07.200]  Show up on time.
[2:57:07.200 --> 2:57:08.400]  That's right, you do.
[2:57:08.400 --> 2:57:09.280]  Yeah, baby.
[2:57:09.280 --> 2:57:10.760]  Back in black.
[2:57:10.760 --> 2:57:14.680]  I show up, suit up and show up.
[2:57:14.680 --> 2:57:16.120]  That's a life showing up.
[2:57:16.120 --> 2:57:20.520]  Exactly, the other half is doing it with a smile.
[2:57:20.520 --> 2:57:22.760]  Or the crowbar.
[2:57:22.760 --> 2:57:24.560]  You bring a crowbar, I'll bring the smile.
[2:57:24.560 --> 2:57:26.640]  That's good, I bring the smile too.
[2:57:26.640 --> 2:57:28.440]  Sometimes you've got to use a baseball bat.
[2:57:28.440 --> 2:57:31.040]  You do, especially with these marxists.
[2:57:31.040 --> 2:57:32.440]  Daniel and Randy, you're taking over.
[2:57:32.440 --> 2:57:34.360]  You're going to host the show the last three segments.
[2:57:34.360 --> 2:57:35.480]  I really look forward to that.
[2:57:35.480 --> 2:57:37.640]  We're going to have the war room coming up after that
[2:57:37.640 --> 2:57:39.400]  and a lot going on today.
[2:57:39.400 --> 2:57:40.960]  How do I follow in your footsteps?
[2:57:40.960 --> 2:57:45.200]  Oh, yeah, much easier than you think, I tell you.
[2:57:45.200 --> 2:57:47.040]  No, seriously, what are the other topics
[2:57:47.040 --> 2:57:48.440]  you're going to cover in the next segment?
[2:57:48.440 --> 2:57:51.240]  We're going to be talking about the absolute clown
[2:57:51.240 --> 2:57:53.480]  show that was the DNC last night.
[2:57:53.480 --> 2:57:56.320]  We had night one, night two, and night three.
[2:57:56.320 --> 2:57:59.720]  I don't think they could get any cringier than each night.
[2:57:59.720 --> 2:58:01.920]  But yet each night somehow proves me wrong.
[2:58:01.920 --> 2:58:03.880]  I don't know about you guys if you watched it or not.
[2:58:03.880 --> 2:58:04.600]  I watched it.
[2:58:04.600 --> 2:58:05.560]  It's so surreal.
[2:58:05.560 --> 2:58:08.840]  It's so bad that it's like it's so.
[2:58:08.840 --> 2:58:10.240]  It's so fake.
[2:58:10.240 --> 2:58:11.120]  It's beautiful.
[2:58:11.120 --> 2:58:11.640]  Right.
[2:58:11.640 --> 2:58:15.600]  Like they are masters at being disingenuous and creepy.
[2:58:15.600 --> 2:58:17.240]  I think if anybody's like, look at this.
[2:58:17.240 --> 2:58:18.280]  This is, what is this?
[2:58:18.280 --> 2:58:19.440]  Arsenio Hall?
[2:58:19.440 --> 2:58:19.880]  I mean, this is.
[2:58:19.880 --> 2:58:21.080]  Now, this is the weird rap video.
[2:58:21.080 --> 2:58:22.200]  They'll play this if you want.
[2:58:22.200 --> 2:58:23.840]  Was so bad.
[2:58:23.840 --> 2:58:25.440]  Yeah, we got to play this next segment.
[2:58:25.440 --> 2:58:28.160]  See, my thing is, though, maybe this is a blessing
[2:58:28.160 --> 2:58:30.120]  in disguise because I don't think, you know,
[2:58:30.120 --> 2:58:32.880]  with all the laughter in the background and the applause
[2:58:32.880 --> 2:58:37.280]  and you have huge stadiums filled with people normally.
[2:58:37.280 --> 2:58:38.920]  So we normally get to disguise.
[2:58:38.920 --> 2:58:40.160]  Look at these two.
[2:58:40.160 --> 2:58:40.640]  Right?
[2:58:40.640 --> 2:58:41.640]  Oh, these are just clowns.
[2:58:41.640 --> 2:58:42.920]  It's like space aliens' land.
[2:58:42.920 --> 2:58:43.720]  Like, look at this.
[2:58:43.720 --> 2:58:45.840]  They even act like they all turn.
[2:58:45.840 --> 2:58:48.080]  You know he wants to get closer to her than that.
[2:58:48.080 --> 2:58:49.320]  You know, he, if anyone.
[2:58:49.320 --> 2:58:51.040]  Oh yeah, they got to do the weird social distance.
[2:58:51.040 --> 2:58:51.520]  Yeah.
[2:58:51.520 --> 2:58:53.760]  It's like, I mean, what the hell?
[2:58:53.760 --> 2:58:56.600]  You know, if anyone hates social distancing is Joe Biden.
[2:58:56.600 --> 2:58:58.400]  He can't smell their hair.
[2:58:58.400 --> 2:58:59.280]  Well, she's not young enough.
[2:58:59.280 --> 2:59:00.320]  She is not three years old.
[2:59:00.320 --> 2:59:00.800]  That's true.
[2:59:00.800 --> 2:59:03.080]  He needs to get the real young ones.
[2:59:03.080 --> 2:59:03.520]  No, but really.
[2:59:03.520 --> 2:59:05.040]  Imagine somebody walks up over and over
[2:59:05.040 --> 2:59:06.120]  and like your five-year-old daughter,
[2:59:06.120 --> 2:59:09.000]  I'm meeting you after this event, baby.
[2:59:09.000 --> 2:59:09.440]  Right.
[2:59:09.440 --> 2:59:11.680]  And he, like he talks to the grandchildren and everything.
[2:59:11.680 --> 2:59:13.840]  Like, well, you know, wait till you're 13 years old.
[2:59:13.840 --> 2:59:14.440]  What does that mean?
[2:59:14.440 --> 2:59:15.960]  How would you feel if he said that to your granddaughter?
[2:59:15.960 --> 2:59:17.680]  You know what he reportedly whispers these little girls?
[2:59:17.680 --> 2:59:19.280]  Here's this well-known.
[2:59:19.280 --> 2:59:21.200]  Wait, he says like, you know, you're turning me on.
[2:59:21.200 --> 2:59:23.040]  I'm really horny right now.
[2:59:23.040 --> 2:59:23.680]  Sick.
[2:59:23.680 --> 2:59:24.360]  I swear to God.
[2:59:24.360 --> 2:59:25.440]  It's so disgusting.
[2:59:25.440 --> 2:59:27.760]  Can you imagine if he said that to your daughter?
[2:59:27.760 --> 2:59:28.720]  What would you, I mean, I can't.
[2:59:28.720 --> 2:59:30.520]  Well, he got cigarette service protection,
[2:59:30.520 --> 2:59:32.200]  something I'm going to say.
[2:59:32.200 --> 2:59:33.880]  And then he got Kamala.
[2:59:33.880 --> 2:59:34.800]  Kamala.
[2:59:34.800 --> 2:59:35.400]  Yeah.
[2:59:35.400 --> 2:59:36.920]  Well, that'd be supposed to say Kamala.
[2:59:36.920 --> 2:59:37.560]  I know.
[2:59:37.560 --> 2:59:38.520]  I know we're supposed to say it.
[2:59:38.520 --> 2:59:39.520]  But, you know, no matter how many...
[2:59:39.520 --> 2:59:40.480]  I'm being sarcastic.
[2:59:40.480 --> 2:59:42.160]  How did Biden said it wrong?
[2:59:42.160 --> 2:59:42.800]  He said...
[2:59:42.800 --> 2:59:46.280]  It was Biden and it was Tucker.
[2:59:46.280 --> 2:59:47.440]  Tucker said it wrong the other night.
[2:59:47.440 --> 2:59:48.720]  He always calls her Kamala.
[2:59:48.720 --> 2:59:49.680]  And then he got scolded.
[2:59:49.680 --> 2:59:51.120]  So I said Kamala, I'm right.
[2:59:51.120 --> 2:59:51.560]  Yeah.
[2:59:51.560 --> 2:59:52.320]  I think so.
[2:59:52.320 --> 2:59:52.560]  I think it's Kamala.
[2:59:52.560 --> 2:59:53.840]  We should call her Kamal.
[2:59:53.840 --> 2:59:56.720]  Well, I like calling her Kamal Toe, actually,
[2:59:56.720 --> 2:59:58.080]  because that's more appropriate.
[2:59:58.080 --> 3:00:00.240]  But no matter how many facelifts she has,
[3:00:00.240 --> 3:00:03.640]  she'll never be a fresh face for the Democrat Party.
[3:00:03.640 --> 3:00:05.040]  And they keep on lifting her up.
[3:00:05.040 --> 3:00:06.720]  Like, she's some sort of fresh face.
[3:00:06.720 --> 3:00:07.880]  Same with Joe Biden.
[3:00:07.880 --> 3:00:08.360]  How?
[3:00:08.360 --> 3:00:10.480]  You know, I feel kind of bad for the younger generation,
[3:00:10.480 --> 3:00:12.560]  because they were expecting someone new, someone vital.
[3:00:12.560 --> 3:00:15.560]  Well, that's a real photo they got of them.
[3:00:15.560 --> 3:00:16.360]  Things are casting.
[3:00:16.360 --> 3:00:17.120]  I know, right?
[3:00:17.120 --> 3:00:18.320]  Look at that.
[3:00:18.320 --> 3:00:19.600]  That's amazing.
[3:00:19.600 --> 3:00:21.160]  That is amazing.
[3:00:21.160 --> 3:00:24.800]  But look, without the laugh track and without the crowds,
[3:00:24.800 --> 3:00:28.080]  we can actually see these clowns for what they really are.
[3:00:28.080 --> 3:00:31.600]  And it's in their naked and all their creepy exposure.
[3:00:31.600 --> 3:00:33.120]  And that has been the last three nights.
[3:00:33.120 --> 3:00:36.440]  It's been a huge gift to the Republican Party.
[3:00:36.440 --> 3:00:39.360]  I just hope that the RNC has learned from this,
[3:00:39.360 --> 3:00:41.040]  and they're not going to make the same mistakes.
[3:00:41.040 --> 3:00:41.640]  What do you think?
[3:00:41.640 --> 3:00:42.520]  Do you think that they're learning?
[3:00:42.520 --> 3:00:43.520]  They're taking cues, and they're
[3:00:43.520 --> 3:00:44.640]  going to do something different?
[3:00:44.640 --> 3:00:46.760]  They should do classic, big convention.
[3:00:46.760 --> 3:00:47.080]  Right.
[3:00:47.080 --> 3:00:47.800]  Not be wimps.
[3:00:47.800 --> 3:00:50.240]  Have everybody in disregard all the BS.
[3:00:50.240 --> 3:00:50.680]  I think so.
[3:00:50.680 --> 3:00:54.480]  And just give them Helen Fire and Brimstone America
[3:00:54.480 --> 3:00:55.680]  and the death of globalism.
[3:00:55.680 --> 3:00:58.520]  He should repeat what he said in his inaugural speech,
[3:00:58.520 --> 3:01:00.040]  but add the fact that he delivered.
[3:01:00.040 --> 3:01:00.600]  I think so, too.
[3:01:00.600 --> 3:01:03.720]  I delivered, and the enemy was summoned to destroy us.
[3:01:03.720 --> 3:01:05.440]  And this is the great battle now.
[3:01:05.440 --> 3:01:07.320]  And you decide whether you'll be enslaved
[3:01:07.320 --> 3:01:08.880]  by these devils or not.
[3:01:08.880 --> 3:01:10.280]  Can you imagine if he did that, he
[3:01:10.280 --> 3:01:12.080]  would get everyone uniting against it,
[3:01:12.080 --> 3:01:12.840]  uniting towards him.
[3:01:12.840 --> 3:01:13.360]  Everyone.
[3:01:13.360 --> 3:01:13.840]  I'm ready.
[3:01:13.840 --> 3:01:14.960]  You need to be president.
[3:01:14.960 --> 3:01:15.760]  No.
[3:01:15.760 --> 3:01:16.640]  No, Trump's doing good.
[3:01:16.640 --> 3:01:16.920]  I know.
[3:01:16.920 --> 3:01:17.760]  No, he's going to be doing great job.
[3:01:17.760 --> 3:01:18.840]  I have a sneaky suspicion.
[3:01:18.840 --> 3:01:20.360]  Some of what we say here will be in his speech.
[3:01:20.360 --> 3:01:22.600]  People will, you know, from, I think
[3:01:22.600 --> 3:01:24.920]  that people even in the middle are longing for that.
[3:01:24.920 --> 3:01:25.880]  They're hungry for that.
[3:01:25.880 --> 3:01:27.840]  They want the man whose law and order,
[3:01:27.840 --> 3:01:29.720]  they're sick of the weak sauce.
[3:01:29.720 --> 3:01:31.040]  And if he did that, I really think
[3:01:31.040 --> 3:01:32.120]  that that would actually bring the better.
[3:01:32.120 --> 3:01:33.320]  Well, metaphysically, it's how it works.
[3:01:33.320 --> 3:01:35.920]  It's kind of like Trump is like the emperor Palpatine,
[3:01:35.920 --> 3:01:36.600]  but in a good way.
[3:01:36.600 --> 3:01:37.080]  Yeah.
[3:01:37.080 --> 3:01:37.720]  On the Darth Vader.
[3:01:37.720 --> 3:01:39.200]  So we both kind of, you know, wasn't really.
[3:01:39.200 --> 3:01:40.520]  Yeah, you play off each other, I guess.
[3:01:40.520 --> 3:01:41.720]  Yeah, yeah, yeah, that's good stuff.
[3:01:41.720 --> 3:01:43.400]  I just, I think the guys in the middle,
[3:01:43.400 --> 3:01:44.360]  I think they want that.
[3:01:44.360 --> 3:01:46.960]  They want the big balls that we elected Trump for.
[3:01:46.960 --> 3:01:47.840]  And he's got that.
[3:01:47.840 --> 3:01:49.040]  He's just got to show it.
[3:01:49.040 --> 3:01:51.040]  And I think he's getting back into that big ball Trump
[3:01:51.040 --> 3:01:52.280]  that we love.
[3:01:52.280 --> 3:01:54.760]  We have to play the ACDC intro song here coming in.
[3:01:54.760 --> 3:01:57.240]  No, no, seriously, let's get serious here.
[3:01:57.240 --> 3:01:59.960]  What are the pitfalls though, election fraud, these mail-in
[3:01:59.960 --> 3:02:00.440]  ballots?
[3:02:00.440 --> 3:02:03.080]  Yeah, the ballot harvesting.
[3:02:03.080 --> 3:02:05.440]  Were there just, were there just floating around?
[3:02:05.440 --> 3:02:07.760]  Trump's right, cats are getting the ballots in the mail.
[3:02:07.760 --> 3:02:08.600]  Oh yeah, yeah.
[3:02:08.600 --> 3:02:11.520]  People who have, you know, my grandfather passed away
[3:02:11.520 --> 3:02:13.440]  a couple of years ago, sadly, but I'm pretty sure
[3:02:13.440 --> 3:02:15.640]  that they're going to have him vote Democrat, you know,
[3:02:15.640 --> 3:02:16.200]  for Biden.
[3:02:16.200 --> 3:02:16.960]  This is what they're doing.
[3:02:16.960 --> 3:02:18.400]  They're resurrecting people from the dead.
[3:02:18.400 --> 3:02:18.880]  What do you do?
[3:02:18.880 --> 3:02:21.400]  I can't bring myself to be engaged in fraud.
[3:02:21.400 --> 3:02:23.640]  You just have to make sure your grandparents
[3:02:23.640 --> 3:02:25.240]  or great-grandparents are off the rolls.
[3:02:25.240 --> 3:02:25.880]  Yeah, yeah.
[3:02:25.880 --> 3:02:27.640]  Just make sure no one's voting in their name.
[3:02:27.640 --> 3:02:30.200]  Like, don't engage in fraud, just make sure they don't.
[3:02:30.200 --> 3:02:30.760]  Right.
[3:02:30.760 --> 3:02:33.280]  But if we, if they're going to be doing ballot harvesting,
[3:02:33.280 --> 3:02:34.920]  you know, two can play at that game, right?
[3:02:34.920 --> 3:02:36.560]  Shouldn't we, we should be doing that too
[3:02:36.560 --> 3:02:37.920]  and beat them at the game?
[3:02:37.920 --> 3:02:39.600]  Explain ballot harvesting to the viewers.
[3:02:39.600 --> 3:02:42.120]  Ballot harvesting is like where they get like thousands
[3:02:42.120 --> 3:02:45.360]  of ballots and then they, they, they collect them all,
[3:02:45.360 --> 3:02:48.120]  have everyone sign the ballots and then, you know,
[3:02:48.120 --> 3:02:50.960]  collect them all and then they deliver it all at one time.
[3:02:50.960 --> 3:02:51.520]  Yeah, exactly.
[3:02:51.520 --> 3:02:53.400]  We don't want the Democrats delivering it.
[3:02:53.400 --> 3:02:54.360]  Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[3:02:54.360 --> 3:02:56.080]  We don't want the Democrats delivering it.
[3:02:56.080 --> 3:02:56.720]  But now they're trying to.
[3:02:56.720 --> 3:02:58.360]  So when everybody to volunteer,
[3:02:58.360 --> 3:03:00.240]  if you have to put a Hillary sticker on,
[3:03:00.240 --> 3:03:01.520]  so you can expose the fraud.
[3:03:01.520 --> 3:03:02.080]  Exactly.
[3:03:02.080 --> 3:03:04.320]  And go to, you know, go to the polls
[3:03:04.320 --> 3:03:06.000]  and make sure there's no crazy business going on
[3:03:06.000 --> 3:03:09.000]  because they're going to try every single attempt to divide us,
[3:03:09.000 --> 3:03:10.200]  every try to attempt to.
[3:03:10.200 --> 3:03:12.080]  What about them claiming he's removing?
[3:03:12.080 --> 3:03:12.960]  Yeah, removing the post.
[3:03:12.960 --> 3:03:14.440]  When it was Obama five years ago,
[3:03:14.440 --> 3:03:17.080]  sign the order that removes them over the next decade.
[3:03:17.080 --> 3:03:20.200]  It's Obama's removing the post boxes.
[3:03:20.200 --> 3:03:20.880]  Mm-hmm.
[3:03:20.880 --> 3:03:23.880]  Well, I think they're going to do something in the last month.
[3:03:23.880 --> 3:03:24.720]  You know, we're at what?
[3:03:24.720 --> 3:03:26.920]  Seventy-five days till the election now.
[3:03:26.920 --> 3:03:29.640]  And again, I think we're at about 20%
[3:03:29.640 --> 3:03:32.280]  of the desperate tactics that they're going to deploy.
[3:03:32.280 --> 3:03:33.640]  I think it's going to get scarier.
[3:03:33.640 --> 3:03:35.280]  I think they're going to do something nuts
[3:03:35.280 --> 3:03:38.600]  that we're not even sure of yet at this point.
[3:03:38.600 --> 3:03:41.080]  They're going to kneecap us every way possible.
[3:03:41.080 --> 3:03:43.040]  But what can we do about it?
[3:03:43.040 --> 3:03:44.360]  Don't you think, don't you just have this feeling
[3:03:44.360 --> 3:03:47.080]  it's going to get super crazy in the next few months?
[3:03:47.080 --> 3:03:49.160]  Oh, I could see it politically and also feel it.
[3:03:49.160 --> 3:03:49.600]  Mm-hmm.
[3:03:49.600 --> 3:03:50.200]  That's why.
[3:03:50.200 --> 3:03:52.080]  Another Joy Floyd, perhaps, incident.
[3:03:52.080 --> 3:03:53.040]  Oh, my God, exactly.
[3:03:53.040 --> 3:03:53.960]  They're going to try everything.
[3:03:53.960 --> 3:03:54.480]  Oh, yeah.
[3:03:54.480 --> 3:03:56.800]  Well, right now, they're doing a hologram, a George Floyd
[3:03:56.800 --> 3:04:00.200]  hologram that's floating all over the US, right?
[3:04:00.200 --> 3:04:04.480]  And it's floating over statues like the Confederate statues.
[3:04:04.480 --> 3:04:07.720]  It's floating over Abraham Lincoln statues and everything.
[3:04:07.720 --> 3:04:08.680]  It's just floating over.
[3:04:08.680 --> 3:04:09.480]  And it's so creepy.
[3:04:09.480 --> 3:04:12.240]  It's like this life-size, huge George Floyd
[3:04:12.240 --> 3:04:13.640]  hologram that's pixelated.
[3:04:13.640 --> 3:04:15.360]  The spirit searching for fentanyl.
[3:04:15.360 --> 3:04:16.160]  The spirit searching.
[3:04:16.160 --> 3:04:17.600]  You know, it's the patron saint.
[3:04:17.600 --> 3:04:19.280]  Give me the fentanyl.
[3:04:19.280 --> 3:04:19.760]  Right.
[3:04:19.760 --> 3:04:21.280]  And it looks like it's made of it, too.
[3:04:21.280 --> 3:04:22.080]  It's all pixelated.
[3:04:22.080 --> 3:04:24.120]  Doesn't that look like it looks like it's
[3:04:24.120 --> 3:04:27.160]  very real life with the meth and everything?
[3:04:27.160 --> 3:04:28.160]  But that's what.
[3:04:28.160 --> 3:04:30.160]  That's how it was feeling when he was having that heart attack.
[3:04:30.160 --> 3:04:30.960]  I'm sorry he's dead.
[3:04:30.960 --> 3:04:31.800]  I'm sorry, too.
[3:04:31.800 --> 3:04:32.400]  But look at this.
[3:04:32.400 --> 3:04:35.880]  And we have our fentanyl gods.
[3:04:35.880 --> 3:04:36.880]  These are the heroes.
[3:04:36.880 --> 3:04:39.120]  These are the gods that they're lifting up and trying
[3:04:39.120 --> 3:04:41.400]  to get people to worship as false idols.
[3:04:41.400 --> 3:04:43.480]  And it's floating around, trying to cancel out
[3:04:43.480 --> 3:04:45.640]  every American statue.
[3:04:45.640 --> 3:04:48.080]  So I predict there's going to be more of these kinds of incidents
[3:04:48.080 --> 3:04:49.080]  over the next couple months.
[3:04:49.080 --> 3:04:51.000]  And I think that it's going to get rougher.
[3:04:51.000 --> 3:04:52.720]  But patriots need to stand up.
[3:04:52.720 --> 3:04:55.000]  I don't think we're doing enough to make
[3:04:55.000 --> 3:04:56.800]  a dent in what the left is doing.
[3:04:56.800 --> 3:04:58.160]  They're ripping down statues.
[3:04:58.160 --> 3:04:59.920]  They're seizing police stations.
[3:04:59.920 --> 3:05:02.480]  I think we need to do a lot more, get more mobilized.
[3:05:02.480 --> 3:05:07.600]  The end of the rain is on fire, like a federal courthouse.
[3:05:07.600 --> 3:05:08.840]  And I didn't plug the last two hours.
[3:05:08.840 --> 3:05:10.120]  I'm going to do it now.
[3:05:10.120 --> 3:05:11.960]  We have the best, highest quality, swarable food.
[3:05:11.960 --> 3:05:13.600]  Everybody needs it in times like these
[3:05:13.600 --> 3:05:16.000]  to have that emergency box checked off.
[3:05:16.000 --> 3:05:17.520]  It's one to two weeks for delivery,
[3:05:17.520 --> 3:05:18.960]  depending on what you order.
[3:05:18.960 --> 3:05:21.880]  At infowarstore.com, we have the food with our big partner.
[3:05:21.880 --> 3:05:23.760]  But they have to get it packaged and out to you.
[3:05:23.760 --> 3:05:26.160]  So they say one to two weeks, infowarstore.com.
[3:05:26.160 --> 3:05:28.400]  And we have this big special going
[3:05:28.400 --> 3:05:31.320]  that is free shipping on all the best-selling supplements
[3:05:31.320 --> 3:05:32.520]  and 50% to 60% off.
[3:05:32.520 --> 3:05:34.440]  And it's your purchase that makes it all possible.
[3:05:34.440 --> 3:05:38.360]  Or try out the new activated charcoal toothpaste
[3:05:38.360 --> 3:05:42.240]  that we have that is enamel safe as well from Dr. Jones
[3:05:42.240 --> 3:05:44.440]  Essentials also at infowarstore.com.
[3:05:44.440 --> 3:05:46.760]  This takes a lot of money to pay for this operation,
[3:05:46.760 --> 3:05:49.680]  the satellites, the servers, the crew, the legal,
[3:05:49.680 --> 3:05:51.320]  the Democrats trying to shut us down.
[3:05:51.320 --> 3:05:54.480]  But thanks to you supporting us through all of this,
[3:05:54.480 --> 3:05:56.640]  we're still here and in way stronger than ever.
[3:05:56.640 --> 3:05:58.320]  And as the new world order unfolds,
[3:05:58.320 --> 3:06:00.400]  as globalism is crazier and crazier,
[3:06:00.400 --> 3:06:02.280]  as all of this becomes apparent,
[3:06:02.280 --> 3:06:05.120]  we have to be on air at those critical points
[3:06:05.120 --> 3:06:07.320]  because we're getting stronger, not weaker.
[3:06:07.320 --> 3:06:09.280]  People understand we told the truth.
[3:06:09.280 --> 3:06:13.640]  They understand the cost, but are they supporting us?
[3:06:13.640 --> 3:06:16.480]  Get supplements, get t-shirts, get books, get films,
[3:06:16.480 --> 3:06:19.000]  get air filtration, get high-quality storeable food.
[3:06:19.000 --> 3:06:21.680]  You and your family need at infowarstore.com

[3:06:23.960 --> 3:06:25.960]  Worldwide, I want to thank you all for your support.
[3:06:25.960 --> 3:06:28.240]  Dan LaRaine is about to take over.
[3:06:28.240 --> 3:06:30.120]  We're gonna right here in the main seat,
[3:06:30.120 --> 3:06:32.240]  right now on the other side.
[3:06:32.240 --> 3:06:33.320]  Tell folks to tune in.
[3:06:33.320 --> 3:06:34.160]  Dan!
[3:06:34.160 --> 3:06:35.000]  Stick around, stick around.
[3:06:35.000 --> 3:06:36.200]  We're gonna go over some craziness.
[3:06:36.200 --> 3:06:37.520]  You're gonna want to stick around.
[3:06:37.520 --> 3:06:38.760]  I'm gonna follow up the big guy.
[3:06:38.760 --> 3:06:40.680]  No, the big guy, the big guy's a fat.
[3:06:40.680 --> 3:06:42.160]  And the war room's coming up.
[3:06:43.840 --> 3:06:45.480]  We've launched our new big special
[3:06:45.480 --> 3:06:46.920]  that's only running for a week,

[3:07:38.720 --> 3:07:39.560]  Ah!
[3:07:39.560 --> 3:07:42.000]  I've talked to the EMS and I've talked to the medical doctors,
[3:07:42.000 --> 3:07:44.480]  and what makes you nauseated is it's not just the smell of piss,
[3:07:44.480 --> 3:07:46.240]  but we call the smell of bum piss,
[3:07:46.240 --> 3:07:48.240]  that has that sweet, nauseating smell.
[3:07:48.240 --> 3:07:51.520]  I wouldn't say sweet, it does, it's a sweet stance,
[3:07:51.520 --> 3:07:53.160]  makes me wanna throw up like Rodney.
[3:07:53.160 --> 3:07:55.480]  It is the crap of dust mites.
[3:07:55.480 --> 3:07:57.760]  Have you noticed the stench of bum piss
[3:07:57.760 --> 3:07:59.920]  in your leftist-run neighborhoods?
[3:07:59.920 --> 3:08:03.600]  The crap of dust mites in bum piss is a real thing,
[3:08:03.600 --> 3:08:06.760]  and infowarstore has the solution.
[3:08:06.760 --> 3:08:10.440]  Infowars has created the most powerful herbal lung cleanse
[3:08:10.440 --> 3:08:13.120]  and respiratory support product on the market,

[3:08:32.920 --> 3:08:34.760]  Order the infowarstore.com.
[3:08:34.760 --> 3:08:37.760]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:10:04.760 --> 3:10:11.760]  Welcome back to Infowars.
[3:10:23.520 --> 3:10:25.640]  I'm Deanna Lorraine, your host for today,
[3:10:25.640 --> 3:10:28.680]  hovering for Alex Jones, the great.
[3:10:28.680 --> 3:10:30.480]  I don't know how I'm gonna follow in his footsteps,
[3:10:30.480 --> 3:10:32.240]  but I'll definitely give it a try.
[3:10:32.240 --> 3:10:33.880]  How's everyone doing today?
[3:10:33.880 --> 3:10:38.880]  Now, last night was day three of the insane clown show,
[3:10:39.080 --> 3:10:41.640]  otherwise known as the DNC,
[3:10:41.640 --> 3:10:43.800]  and I'm pretty sure most of you watched it.
[3:10:43.800 --> 3:10:46.720]  It was abysmal, but luckily,
[3:10:46.720 --> 3:10:50.280]  it has just displayed a full blown
[3:10:50.280 --> 3:10:52.040]  who the Democrats really are.
[3:10:52.040 --> 3:10:54.400]  So we're gonna play a couple clips from it
[3:10:54.400 --> 3:10:57.080]  just to recap this insanity.
[3:10:57.080 --> 3:10:58.920]  But the first was Kamala's speech.
[3:10:58.920 --> 3:11:03.440]  Now, Kamala, she actually said with a straight face
[3:11:03.440 --> 3:11:07.120]  that the coronavirus promotes racism.
[3:11:07.120 --> 3:11:11.280]  That the coronavirus is tied into George Floyd
[3:11:11.280 --> 3:11:14.040]  and police brutality
[3:11:14.040 --> 3:11:16.160]  and the racial division in our country.
[3:11:16.160 --> 3:11:17.000]  So we know that,
[3:11:17.000 --> 3:11:18.480]  we know that they're trying to connect the dots.
[3:11:18.480 --> 3:11:19.880]  They've been trying to connect it from day one
[3:11:19.880 --> 3:11:22.200]  because that's all part of the Psyop.
[3:11:22.200 --> 3:11:24.560]  But the fact that she actually with a straight face
[3:11:24.560 --> 3:11:26.280]  tied it in is something else.
[3:11:26.280 --> 3:11:27.440]  So let's roll the clip here
[3:11:27.440 --> 3:11:30.440]  and see how the hell she, Kamala Harris,
[3:11:30.440 --> 3:11:33.880]  is tying it in with a straight face during her speech.
[3:11:33.880 --> 3:11:34.880]  Do we have the clip?
[3:11:36.280 --> 3:11:41.280]  Loss of normalcy and yes, the loss of certainty.
[3:11:44.080 --> 3:11:48.440]  And while this virus touches us all,
[3:11:48.440 --> 3:11:50.200]  we gotta be honest,
[3:11:50.200 --> 3:11:53.140]  it is not an equal opportunity offender.
[3:11:54.200 --> 3:11:56.920]  Black, Latino and indigenous people
[3:11:56.920 --> 3:12:00.560]  are suffering and dying disproportionately.
[3:12:00.560 --> 3:12:02.520]  And this is not a coincidence.
[3:12:02.520 --> 3:12:06.280]  It is the effect of structural racism,
[3:12:06.280 --> 3:12:09.160]  of inequities in education and technology,
[3:12:09.160 --> 3:12:13.440]  healthcare and housing, job security and transportation,
[3:12:14.360 --> 3:12:18.920]  the injustice in reproductive and maternal healthcare,
[3:12:18.920 --> 3:12:22.400]  in the excessive use of force by police
[3:12:22.400 --> 3:12:27.180]  and in our broader criminal justice system.
[3:12:27.180 --> 3:12:31.080]  This virus, it has no eyes
[3:12:31.080 --> 3:12:36.080]  and yet it knows exactly how we see each other
[3:12:37.120 --> 3:12:39.440]  and how we treat each other.
[3:12:41.080 --> 3:12:43.040]  And let's be clear,
[3:12:43.040 --> 3:12:46.920]  there is no vaccine for racism.
[3:12:46.920 --> 3:12:51.920]  We've gotta do the work for George Floyd,
[3:12:54.440 --> 3:12:56.840]  for Breonna Taylor,
[3:12:56.840 --> 3:12:59.600]  for the lives of too many others to name,
[3:13:00.520 --> 3:13:05.600]  for our children and for all of us.
[3:13:05.600 --> 3:13:10.180]  We've gotta do the work to fulfill that promise
[3:13:10.180 --> 3:13:12.760]  of equal justice under law.
[3:13:12.760 --> 3:13:16.680]  Because here's the thing, none of us are free
[3:13:16.680 --> 3:13:19.200]  until all of us.
[3:13:19.200 --> 3:13:22.920]  So that was Kamala Harris and the DNC last night.
[3:13:22.920 --> 3:13:25.920]  And honestly, that was even worse than I remembered it.
[3:13:25.920 --> 3:13:29.960]  She's basically admitting that the coronavirus is a weapon.
[3:13:29.960 --> 3:13:32.100]  It's whatever the hell they want it to be.
[3:13:32.100 --> 3:13:36.160]  And it somehow sees people and sees and hears
[3:13:36.160 --> 3:13:39.360]  how we treat people, it feels people.
[3:13:39.360 --> 3:13:43.280]  It somehow knows racism and promotes racial division.
[3:13:43.280 --> 3:13:46.480]  She also tied it into police brutality.
[3:13:46.480 --> 3:13:49.480]  She tied it into women's reproductive rights.
[3:13:49.480 --> 3:13:51.600]  I mean, how many different ways
[3:13:51.600 --> 3:13:54.440]  can the coronavirus have a mind of its own?
[3:13:54.440 --> 3:13:56.240]  But that's been the problem since day one
[3:13:56.240 --> 3:13:57.080]  and we all know this.
[3:13:57.080 --> 3:13:58.760]  This is why it's such a sham.
[3:13:58.760 --> 3:14:01.280]  This is why when they install curfews
[3:14:01.280 --> 3:14:02.880]  like in Miami-Dade County,
[3:14:02.880 --> 3:14:06.800]  if there's an 8 p.m. curfew for the coronavirus.
[3:14:06.800 --> 3:14:10.120]  Now please tell me what kind of a coronavirus,
[3:14:10.120 --> 3:14:12.400]  what kind of any virus is smart enough
[3:14:12.400 --> 3:14:16.800]  that when you are sitting at a bar at 7.59 p.m.,
[3:14:16.800 --> 3:14:19.720]  you're totally safe from the coronavirus.
[3:14:19.720 --> 3:14:23.840]  All of a sudden at 8 p.m., the clock switches and boom.
[3:14:23.840 --> 3:14:26.200]  Here comes the coronavirus coming to get ya.
[3:14:26.200 --> 3:14:27.900]  All of a sudden, you're super contagious
[3:14:27.900 --> 3:14:28.920]  for the coronavirus.
[3:14:28.920 --> 3:14:31.260]  Have you ever heard of a virus like that?
[3:14:31.260 --> 3:14:34.180]  No, you haven't because it's not real.
[3:14:34.180 --> 3:14:37.160]  Just like we've never heard of any kind of a virus
[3:14:37.160 --> 3:14:40.200]  that goes around and goes to churches,
[3:14:40.200 --> 3:14:45.040]  but skips Walmarts, that goes to people's family barbecues,
[3:14:45.040 --> 3:14:47.400]  but skips Black Lives Matter rallies.
[3:14:47.400 --> 3:14:49.520]  We've never heard of any kind of a virus like that
[3:14:49.520 --> 3:14:52.440]  that's so sophisticated, so intelligent,
[3:14:52.440 --> 3:14:56.440]  and so discriminatory because it doesn't exist.
[3:14:56.440 --> 3:14:58.240]  But I think that it's funny last night
[3:14:58.240 --> 3:15:00.440]  that, you know, and I actually got some comments last night
[3:15:00.440 --> 3:15:02.680]  from people who were liberals saying,
[3:15:02.680 --> 3:15:05.360]  you know what, this is a little bit of a stretch.
[3:15:05.360 --> 3:15:07.000]  You know, this is a bit of a stretch,
[3:15:07.000 --> 3:15:08.240]  and they're starting to realize,
[3:15:08.240 --> 3:15:10.800]  especially with all the constant blaming
[3:15:10.800 --> 3:15:15.000]  of the coronavirus and the job loss from President Trump,
[3:15:15.000 --> 3:15:17.040]  people are finally, I think, starting to wake up
[3:15:17.040 --> 3:15:19.000]  to the reality that this coronavirus
[3:15:19.000 --> 3:15:21.960]  is a political weapon used by the deep state,
[3:15:21.960 --> 3:15:25.240]  and people don't, people are realizing it.
[3:15:25.240 --> 3:15:28.840]  It's all for the purpose of destroying our country.
[3:15:28.840 --> 3:15:30.840]  I even had some liberals the other day.
[3:15:30.840 --> 3:15:34.360]  One, I have a couple liberal friends
[3:15:34.360 --> 3:15:36.560]  who were friends from college, okay,
[3:15:36.560 --> 3:15:39.000]  and they're slowly starting to wake up.
[3:15:39.000 --> 3:15:41.480]  One of my friends was walking down the street
[3:15:41.480 --> 3:15:43.120]  right along the beach,
[3:15:43.120 --> 3:15:46.600]  and a woman screamed at her for not wearing a mask,
[3:15:46.600 --> 3:15:49.800]  and she called her a pig for not wearing a mask.
[3:15:49.800 --> 3:15:50.880]  And of course, you can't say this
[3:15:50.880 --> 3:15:52.320]  to any of her other liberal friends,
[3:15:52.320 --> 3:15:53.720]  so she complained to me about it,
[3:15:53.720 --> 3:15:55.360]  and she said, you know what, Deanna,
[3:15:55.360 --> 3:15:58.160]  I finally am starting to see what's going on here.
[3:15:58.160 --> 3:16:00.160]  I'm finally starting to see a little bit
[3:16:00.160 --> 3:16:01.880]  what the conservatives have been complaining
[3:16:01.880 --> 3:16:03.480]  about this whole time.
[3:16:03.480 --> 3:16:05.480]  So I do think they're, as usual,
[3:16:05.480 --> 3:16:07.640]  they're overplaying their hand here,
[3:16:07.640 --> 3:16:09.920]  but let's go back to Kamala again.
[3:16:09.920 --> 3:16:12.960]  We got one more awesome comment from her
[3:16:12.960 --> 3:16:16.280]  where she somehow says, with a straight face,
[3:16:16.280 --> 3:16:19.000]  I know a predator when I see one.
[3:16:19.000 --> 3:16:21.280]  Yes, with a straight face, she says,
[3:16:21.280 --> 3:16:23.960]  I know a predator when I see one.
[3:16:23.960 --> 3:16:25.200]  Can we roll that clip?
[3:16:25.200 --> 3:16:30.200]  I have fought for children and survivors of sexual assault.
[3:16:30.520 --> 3:16:34.000]  I fought against transnational criminal organizations.
[3:16:34.000 --> 3:16:37.000]  I took on the biggest banks and helped take down
[3:16:37.000 --> 3:16:39.600]  one of the biggest for-profit colleges.
[3:16:41.080 --> 3:16:43.360]  I know a predator when I see one.
[3:16:45.360 --> 3:16:47.600]  I mean, you can't make this stuff up, folks.
[3:16:47.600 --> 3:16:49.720]  I know a predator when I see one,
[3:16:49.720 --> 3:16:52.840]  yet she surrounds herself with predators like Joe Biden,
[3:16:52.840 --> 3:16:54.520]  who she actually said last year
[3:16:54.520 --> 3:16:56.720]  that she believed Tara Reid.
[3:16:56.720 --> 3:16:59.080]  She believed the people who are accusing him
[3:16:59.080 --> 3:17:02.040]  of sexual harassment and assault and sniffing women's hair
[3:17:02.040 --> 3:17:05.080]  and whatever the hell else creepy things that he's into.
[3:17:05.080 --> 3:17:07.200]  And she surrounds herself with Bill Clinton,
[3:17:07.200 --> 3:17:09.480]  who we know is a known rapist and pedophile.
[3:17:09.480 --> 3:17:12.000]  Okay, all right, sounds good, Kamala.
[3:17:12.000 --> 3:17:13.440]  You know a predator when I see one.
[3:17:13.440 --> 3:17:14.640]  What kind of an investigator,
[3:17:14.640 --> 3:17:18.160]  what kind of a prosecutor are you who understands predators?
[3:17:18.160 --> 3:17:21.440]  And this is, again, I think this just on full display,
[3:17:21.440 --> 3:17:23.640]  we see the monstrosity.
[3:17:23.640 --> 3:17:25.480]  We see the hypocrisy.
[3:17:25.480 --> 3:17:30.480]  We see the creep factor of the Democrats on display,
[3:17:30.720 --> 3:17:32.280]  because we don't have a laugh track.
[3:17:32.280 --> 3:17:34.760]  We don't have fans in the background cheering.
[3:17:34.760 --> 3:17:36.920]  We got them on full display in the flesh.
[3:17:36.920 --> 3:17:38.920]  And we will be right back with a quick break
[3:17:38.920 --> 3:17:41.200]  and we're gonna go into more of this crazy.
[3:17:42.920 --> 3:17:45.400]  I don't have to tell you that fish oil
[3:17:45.400 --> 3:17:47.400]  is known to be so good for your brain,
[3:17:47.400 --> 3:17:50.080]  so good for your heart, so good for your cells,
[3:17:50.080 --> 3:17:53.120]  your cardiovascular system, your lungs, your sleep.
[3:17:53.120 --> 3:17:54.480]  It's amazing.
[3:17:54.480 --> 3:17:56.560]  Well, we set out a few years ago
[3:17:56.560 --> 3:18:00.280]  to go out and develop with top manufacturers
[3:18:00.280 --> 3:18:03.880]  the strongest, highest quality, purest fish oil out there.

[3:18:40.920 --> 3:18:44.320]  The New World Order is a planetary corporate plan
[3:18:44.320 --> 3:18:46.560]  for world government.
[3:18:46.560 --> 3:18:49.800]  But world government is only the control grid.
[3:18:49.800 --> 3:18:53.400]  Now, inner members of the cult are told
[3:18:53.400 --> 3:18:55.920]  that they are gonna transcend and become gods
[3:18:55.920 --> 3:18:57.400]  and attain immortality.
[3:18:57.400 --> 3:18:59.400]  But the price for that is to carry out
[3:18:59.400 --> 3:19:04.400]  the orderly extermination of all carbon-based line forms.
[3:19:04.400 --> 3:19:06.640]  That's why they say carbon is bad.
[3:19:06.640 --> 3:19:10.360]  They are rewriting the entire genetic code of the planet.
[3:19:10.360 --> 3:19:12.240]  They are playing God.
[3:19:12.240 --> 3:19:14.600]  They believe they have been inspired
[3:19:14.600 --> 3:19:16.680]  by interdimensional entities
[3:19:16.680 --> 3:19:19.080]  that are giving them advanced technology
[3:19:19.080 --> 3:19:22.080]  to carry out this transformation.
[3:19:22.080 --> 3:19:23.760]  I know this sounds insane,
[3:19:23.760 --> 3:19:25.520]  but if you read the writings of the globalists,
[3:19:25.520 --> 3:19:27.400]  it's all on record.
[3:19:27.400 --> 3:19:29.840]  You have been warned.
[3:19:29.840 --> 3:19:32.640]  You have been given the information
[3:19:32.640 --> 3:19:34.320]  to say no to this plan.
[3:19:34.320 --> 3:19:37.880]  This is the end of all life on Earth as we know it.
[3:19:37.880 --> 3:19:40.880]  This is the alien takeover of Earth.
[3:19:40.880 --> 3:19:43.080]  I'm gonna say something right now.
[3:19:43.080 --> 3:19:44.840]  It is one of the most important things I've ever said,
[3:19:44.840 --> 3:19:47.400]  so please listen very, very carefully.
[3:19:47.400 --> 3:19:50.520]  Donald Trump is not the reason
[3:19:50.520 --> 3:19:53.320]  they released COVID or had the lockdown.
[3:19:53.320 --> 3:19:54.280]  They already had this plan,
[3:19:54.280 --> 3:19:57.880]  the Rockefeller Foundation and Bill of Melinda Gates.
[3:19:57.880 --> 3:20:00.240]  It is beyond critical.
[3:20:00.240 --> 3:20:01.760]  It is life and death for you and your family
[3:20:01.760 --> 3:20:03.680]  to understand, I'm not a real living planet,
[3:20:03.680 --> 3:20:07.360]  but this is a worldwide world government takeover
[3:20:07.360 --> 3:20:11.080]  on record that it's never going to end.
[3:20:11.080 --> 3:20:13.120]  The United Nations has admitted that.
[3:20:13.120 --> 3:20:14.840]  First it's a month, then it's six months,
[3:20:14.840 --> 3:20:16.640]  then they say, okay, it's two years.
[3:20:16.640 --> 3:20:19.080]  They're now saying two years.
[3:20:19.080 --> 3:20:21.800]  They're now saying you'll never go back to normal.
[3:20:21.800 --> 3:20:24.120]  No more gatherings, no more anything.
[3:20:24.120 --> 3:20:28.320]  Constant force inoculations that they admit don't even work.
[3:20:28.320 --> 3:20:31.120]  And the way they say they work, they change your DNA.
[3:20:31.120 --> 3:20:34.280]  This is the culling of the planet.
[3:20:34.280 --> 3:20:37.080]  This is the beginning of a straight jacket being put on you
[3:20:37.080 --> 3:20:39.560]  before you're slowly tortured to death and killed.
[3:20:39.560 --> 3:20:40.400]  Do you understand?
[3:20:40.400 --> 3:20:44.120]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:20:51.120 --> 3:20:52.360]  Welcome back to Info Wars.
[3:20:52.360 --> 3:20:56.560]  This is Deanna Lorraine, guest hosting for the great Alex Jones.
[3:20:56.560 --> 3:20:58.760]  And we're just doing a little bit of a recap
[3:20:58.760 --> 3:21:01.160]  of the show that we're going to be talking about.
[3:21:01.160 --> 3:21:02.640]  We're going to be doing a little bit of a recap
[3:21:02.640 --> 3:21:04.480]  of the show that we're going to be talking about.
[3:21:04.480 --> 3:21:05.640]  And we're going to be talking about
[3:21:05.640 --> 3:21:08.080]  the great Alex Jones show that we're going to be talking about.
[3:21:08.080 --> 3:21:11.520]  And we're just doing a little bit of a recap of the absolute
[3:21:11.520 --> 3:21:14.600]  freak show that has been the DNC all week long,
[3:21:14.600 --> 3:21:19.720]  the DNC over Zoom with no people, no fans in the audience.
[3:21:19.720 --> 3:21:21.800]  And what is so fantastic about this
[3:21:21.800 --> 3:21:24.920]  is not only it's a gift, obviously, to the RNC,
[3:21:24.920 --> 3:21:28.600]  it's a gift to conservatives, but in many ways it is.
[3:21:28.600 --> 3:21:31.560]  But it's also, it's skins, literally.
[3:21:31.560 --> 3:21:36.120]  It's like leaving these liberals, these leftist naked
[3:21:36.120 --> 3:21:38.640]  because there's no laugh track in the background.
[3:21:38.640 --> 3:21:42.120]  There's no audience in the background to mute their creepiness.
[3:21:42.120 --> 3:21:45.520]  We could just see them in all their creepy glory
[3:21:45.520 --> 3:21:48.240]  and all their weird flaws, warts and all.
[3:21:48.240 --> 3:21:50.720]  So we're going to go with this clip in a second.
[3:21:50.720 --> 3:21:54.440]  We're going to play this clip of a guy who literally,
[3:21:54.440 --> 3:21:57.920]  his only job was to announce President
[3:21:57.920 --> 3:22:00.480]  or Vice President Joe Biden.
[3:22:00.480 --> 3:22:02.520]  And he couldn't even say his name right.
[3:22:02.520 --> 3:22:04.000]  He didn't even know his name.
[3:22:04.000 --> 3:22:06.280]  And then we get into what I think
[3:22:06.280 --> 3:22:09.800]  is the cringiest moment of maybe the DNC so far,
[3:22:09.800 --> 3:22:12.920]  where they announced his presidency,
[3:22:12.920 --> 3:22:15.960]  Joe Biden's presidency, their endorsement,
[3:22:15.960 --> 3:22:18.240]  and it got into some weird stuff.
[3:22:18.240 --> 3:22:20.360]  So let's play this clip right now that cringe,
[3:22:20.360 --> 3:22:23.640]  what I think is the cringiest moment of the DNC so far.
[3:22:24.640 --> 3:22:27.080]  In the pursuit of a more just future,
[3:22:27.080 --> 3:22:29.360]  one that recognizes healthcare as a human right,
[3:22:29.360 --> 3:22:31.080]  one that tackles the climate crisis
[3:22:31.080 --> 3:22:34.880]  and takes on racial and economic justice.
[3:22:34.880 --> 3:22:37.640]  Wisconsin cast 30 votes for Bernie Sanders
[3:22:37.640 --> 3:22:39.680]  and 67 for the next president
[3:22:39.680 --> 3:22:41.520]  of the United States of America,
[3:22:41.520 --> 3:22:43.960]  Joseph Bidens, Joseph R. Biden.
[3:22:47.800 --> 3:22:48.640]  What?
[3:22:53.320 --> 3:22:55.440]  Well, we don't have a balloon drop.
[3:22:55.440 --> 3:22:56.520]  Instead, you see that?
[3:22:56.520 --> 3:23:01.360]  This is a map of America celebrating Joe Biden
[3:23:01.360 --> 3:23:03.640]  as the 2020 Democratic presidential nominee.
[3:23:03.640 --> 3:23:06.080]  These are live streams coming in from all across the country.
[3:23:06.080 --> 3:23:08.400]  Oh my God, Joe didn't even know where he is.
[3:23:08.400 --> 3:23:09.840]  He doesn't know where he is.
[3:23:11.120 --> 3:23:12.840]  The people popping out of a library,
[3:23:12.840 --> 3:23:15.520]  like with streamers and everything, this is so creepy.
[3:23:19.520 --> 3:23:22.240]  These are obviously train seals, clapping.
[3:23:22.240 --> 3:23:25.760]  Oh my God, how much have these people paid?
[3:23:25.760 --> 3:23:28.360]  It's so weird.
[3:23:35.360 --> 3:23:37.000]  Oh my gosh.
[3:23:38.360 --> 3:23:40.000]  What, are they dancing right now?
[3:23:40.000 --> 3:23:50.000]  Oh my God, this is so weird, this is hard to watch.
[3:23:59.520 --> 3:24:02.520]  Oh my God, he does not know where he is.
[3:24:02.520 --> 3:24:05.240]  Very, very much, from the bottom of my heart,
[3:24:05.240 --> 3:24:08.520]  thank you all, it means the world to me and my family.
[3:24:08.520 --> 3:24:10.040]  Looks like Antifa in the background.
[3:24:10.040 --> 3:24:11.800]  Thank you all on Thursday.
[3:24:11.800 --> 3:24:13.640]  Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[3:24:20.160 --> 3:24:26.360]  Joe Biden and his family, his nomination for Democratic,
[3:24:28.840 --> 3:24:30.640]  he's putting on that mask.
[3:24:30.640 --> 3:24:33.600]  He's putting on that mask, did you hear them in the background?
[3:24:33.600 --> 3:24:36.880]  He's putting on that mask, it's such a pandering fool,
[3:24:36.880 --> 3:24:38.840]  putting on the mask at the end.
[3:24:38.840 --> 3:24:41.880]  And the mask is symbolic too, what he's really telling you
[3:24:41.880 --> 3:24:44.880]  is if you vote for me, this is your future.
[3:24:44.880 --> 3:24:47.640]  Your future is comprised of,
[3:24:47.640 --> 3:24:50.320]  it's gonna be comprised of obedience,
[3:24:50.320 --> 3:24:52.640]  it's gonna be a good thing, it's gonna be a good thing.
[3:24:52.640 --> 3:24:54.640]  It's gonna be a good thing.
[3:24:54.640 --> 3:24:56.640]  It's gonna be a good thing.
[3:24:56.640 --> 3:24:58.640]  It's gonna be a good thing.
[3:24:58.640 --> 3:25:00.920]  It's gonna be comprised of obedience,
[3:25:00.920 --> 3:25:02.560]  and silence, and control.
[3:25:02.560 --> 3:25:04.200]  That's the future you can vote for.
[3:25:04.200 --> 3:25:06.120]  Now, the other creepy thing about this
[3:25:06.120 --> 3:25:08.960]  is we realize this later, some people called this out,
[3:25:08.960 --> 3:25:11.640]  but in those Zoom shots, right,
[3:25:11.640 --> 3:25:13.320]  where all of these people's clapping,
[3:25:13.320 --> 3:25:15.080]  and there's like a cluster of all these peoples,
[3:25:15.080 --> 3:25:16.800]  about 30 people in windows,
[3:25:16.800 --> 3:25:20.200]  what they found is that they are so fraudulent
[3:25:20.200 --> 3:25:22.320]  that they duplicated people.
[3:25:22.320 --> 3:25:24.520]  Oh my God, they duplicated people
[3:25:24.520 --> 3:25:26.560]  over and over in these Zoom shots.
[3:25:26.560 --> 3:25:30.200]  So they couldn't even find 30 original people
[3:25:30.200 --> 3:25:34.000]  to support and clap for Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.
[3:25:34.000 --> 3:25:36.280]  That's how bad it is, folks, that's how bad it is.
[3:25:36.280 --> 3:25:41.280]  Now, when you look at these trained actors, right,
[3:25:41.840 --> 3:25:43.560]  who are clapping and who just,
[3:25:43.560 --> 3:25:45.760]  you know, they're zooming up and they're clapping, right,
[3:25:45.760 --> 3:25:48.040]  you look at that and you compare that
[3:25:48.040 --> 3:25:51.360]  with Trump's real supporters and his rallies,
[3:25:51.360 --> 3:25:54.240]  which are just roaring and screaming and shouting.
[3:25:54.240 --> 3:25:55.200]  You know, women are practically
[3:25:55.200 --> 3:25:57.040]  throwing their bras at President Trump
[3:25:57.040 --> 3:25:58.600]  because he's such a rock star.
[3:25:58.600 --> 3:26:00.480]  It is literally night and day, guys.
[3:26:00.480 --> 3:26:04.480]  It is night and day, it is fake versus real,
[3:26:04.480 --> 3:26:05.560]  and that's all they have.
[3:26:05.560 --> 3:26:07.640]  I can't believe their Psyop goes to these lengths
[3:26:07.640 --> 3:26:11.080]  where they have to literally superimpose fans in there
[3:26:11.080 --> 3:26:14.120]  just to generate some sort of excitement.
[3:26:14.120 --> 3:26:16.480]  Now we're gonna talk a little bit about Pelosi,
[3:26:16.480 --> 3:26:19.400]  nasty Pelosi, who I obviously ran against
[3:26:19.400 --> 3:26:21.120]  and I know a lot about her,
[3:26:21.120 --> 3:26:23.360]  I know this woman very intimately,
[3:26:23.360 --> 3:26:26.000]  but Pelosi's speech was also pretty cringe.
[3:26:26.000 --> 3:26:27.040]  Do we have that clip?
[3:26:28.600 --> 3:26:29.440]  Okay.
[3:26:33.720 --> 3:26:35.200]  And now, please welcome,
[3:26:35.200 --> 3:26:36.040]  oh my God,
[3:26:36.040 --> 3:26:38.040]  the United States House of Representatives,
[3:26:38.040 --> 3:26:38.880]  Nancy Pelosi.
[3:26:38.880 --> 3:26:41.040]  My honor to bring you the greetings of House Democrats,
[3:26:41.040 --> 3:26:43.440]  the most diverse majority in history,
[3:26:43.440 --> 3:26:48.320]  more than 60% women, people of color, and LGBTQ.
[3:26:48.320 --> 3:26:52.640]  Our diversity is our strength, our unity is our power.
[3:26:52.640 --> 3:26:55.960]  This month, as America marks the centennial of women,
[3:26:55.960 --> 3:26:57.960]  finally women winning the right to vote,
[3:26:57.960 --> 3:27:01.960]  we do so with 105 women in the House.
[3:27:01.960 --> 3:27:05.360]  Proudly, 90 are Democrats.
[3:27:05.360 --> 3:27:06.200]  Oh, that's scary.
[3:27:06.200 --> 3:27:07.680]  To win the vote when they marched and fought
[3:27:07.680 --> 3:27:11.120]  and never gave in, we stand on their shoulders,
[3:27:11.120 --> 3:27:12.520]  charged with carrying forward
[3:27:12.520 --> 3:27:14.080]  the unfinished work of our nation,
[3:27:14.080 --> 3:27:15.560]  advanced by heroes,
[3:27:15.560 --> 3:27:19.360]  from Seneca Falls to Selma to Stonewall.
[3:27:19.360 --> 3:27:20.800]  Four years ago,
[3:27:20.800 --> 3:27:22.840]  when President Obama and Vice President Biden
[3:27:22.840 --> 3:27:25.280]  were in the White House, they made us proud.
[3:27:25.280 --> 3:27:26.600]  I like the birds flying in the background.
[3:27:26.600 --> 3:27:28.760]  And they made our country great.
[3:27:28.760 --> 3:27:31.320]  In that spirit, we come together now,
[3:27:31.320 --> 3:27:33.280]  not to decry the darkness,
[3:27:33.280 --> 3:27:36.560]  but to light a way forward for our country.
[3:27:36.560 --> 3:27:39.400]  That is the guiding purpose of House Democrats,
[3:27:39.400 --> 3:27:41.560]  fighting for the people.
[3:27:41.560 --> 3:27:42.400]  Really?
[3:27:42.400 --> 3:27:44.480]  We have sent the Senate bills for lower healthcare costs,
[3:27:44.480 --> 3:27:46.920]  for bigger paychecks, for cleaner government,
[3:27:46.920 --> 3:27:49.160]  protecting John Lewis' voting rights,
[3:27:49.160 --> 3:27:52.400]  and enacting George Floyd Justice and Policing Act.
[3:27:52.400 --> 3:27:55.920]  Always, always calling in George Floyd and John Lewis.
[3:27:55.920 --> 3:27:58.320]  To seek you equality, to prevent gun violence,
[3:27:58.320 --> 3:28:01.600]  and to preserve our planet for future generations.
[3:28:01.600 --> 3:28:02.560]  I can't even watch this anymore.
[3:28:02.560 --> 3:28:03.880]  And even more.
[3:28:03.880 --> 3:28:06.600]  All of this is possible for America,
[3:28:06.600 --> 3:28:08.560]  who was standing in the way,
[3:28:08.560 --> 3:28:11.000]  Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump.
[3:28:12.600 --> 3:28:13.960]  Our nation's best is the world.
[3:28:13.960 --> 3:28:15.880]  She noticed she had to basically look at her script
[3:28:15.880 --> 3:28:17.640]  to say, what's standing in the way?
[3:28:17.640 --> 3:28:19.440]  Mitch McConnell and Donald Trump.
[3:28:19.440 --> 3:28:20.880]  You also wonder too,
[3:28:20.880 --> 3:28:23.920]  I mean, notice how she was dressed in all white,
[3:28:23.920 --> 3:28:25.640]  and she had, she was clutching her hands,
[3:28:25.640 --> 3:28:26.800]  like she was praying.
[3:28:26.800 --> 3:28:28.440]  She's talking about guiding light.
[3:28:28.440 --> 3:28:31.400]  These are all just part of the Psyop, right?
[3:28:31.400 --> 3:28:35.240]  She's trying to look all angelic, and pristine, and white.
[3:28:35.240 --> 3:28:36.080]  Who is she fooling?
[3:28:36.080 --> 3:28:37.200]  She's not fooling anyone.
[3:28:37.200 --> 3:28:38.960]  She's as demonic as they come,
[3:28:38.960 --> 3:28:42.160]  and I know that firsthand from battling her.
[3:28:42.160 --> 3:28:44.480]  So, you know, notice too,
[3:28:44.480 --> 3:28:46.680]  how, and I've been calling it from the beginning,
[3:28:46.680 --> 3:28:49.000]  Alex has been calling it from the beginning, obviously.
[3:28:49.000 --> 3:28:51.160]  But this is all, this is,
[3:28:51.160 --> 3:28:55.920]  part of this is connecting COVID with police brutality,
[3:28:55.920 --> 3:29:00.000]  and climate change, and sustainable development, right?
[3:29:00.000 --> 3:29:01.040]  And people in the beginning say,
[3:29:01.040 --> 3:29:02.400]  no, you're crazy, you're crazy.
[3:29:02.400 --> 3:29:03.520]  They're not gonna connect it.
[3:29:03.520 --> 3:29:05.240]  And look what, they're already doing it.
[3:29:05.240 --> 3:29:07.200]  They're connecting climate change,
[3:29:07.200 --> 3:29:08.520]  and sustainable development,
[3:29:08.520 --> 3:29:11.760]  and all the goals of Agenda 2030 or Agenda 21,
[3:29:11.760 --> 3:29:13.600]  they're connecting it all, folks.
[3:29:13.600 --> 3:29:14.920]  And we see even, you know,
[3:29:14.920 --> 3:29:18.400]  coronavirus is, because of coronavirus,
[3:29:18.400 --> 3:29:19.840]  we shouldn't eat meat anymore.
[3:29:19.840 --> 3:29:21.320]  We should restrict our meat.
[3:29:21.320 --> 3:29:22.640]  We should become vegans.
[3:29:22.640 --> 3:29:23.760]  Okay.
[3:29:23.760 --> 3:29:26.040]  All of a sudden, it's because of coronavirus,
[3:29:26.040 --> 3:29:28.800]  we should start moving into smaller homes.
[3:29:28.800 --> 3:29:30.000]  Yeah, okay.
[3:29:30.000 --> 3:29:32.400]  Because of coronavirus, we should stop going to churches.
[3:29:32.400 --> 3:29:34.440]  It's all because of coronavirus.
[3:29:34.440 --> 3:29:37.320]  You know, we should be wearing masks during sex.
[3:29:37.320 --> 3:29:40.520]  We should be not kissing anymore or procreating.
[3:29:40.520 --> 3:29:42.640]  All of this is just a cover, right?
[3:29:42.640 --> 3:29:44.400]  Coronavirus is just a cover.
[3:29:44.400 --> 3:29:46.920]  But it's ridiculous for those of us who are awake
[3:29:46.920 --> 3:29:48.280]  and who know what's up,
[3:29:48.280 --> 3:29:50.400]  and who connected the dots already,
[3:29:50.400 --> 3:29:52.080]  and you can see Agenda 2030.
[3:29:52.080 --> 3:29:55.200]  We can see the Fourth Industrial Revolution,
[3:29:55.200 --> 3:29:57.800]  which was, of course, created by the World Economic Forum
[3:29:57.800 --> 3:29:59.880]  and all these globalist actors.
[3:29:59.880 --> 3:30:02.840]  You just go on it, and they tell you the plans,
[3:30:02.840 --> 3:30:05.600]  right there in black and white, they tell you it.
[3:30:05.600 --> 3:30:06.920]  They're not hiding it, folks.
[3:30:06.920 --> 3:30:08.400]  They're not hiding it.
[3:30:08.400 --> 3:30:11.640]  It's our damn fault if we're not gonna do anything about it
[3:30:11.640 --> 3:30:13.240]  when they're putting those plans
[3:30:13.240 --> 3:30:15.440]  right there in black and white, you know?
[3:30:15.440 --> 3:30:19.120]  And then, yeah, we got Soros' granddaughter,
[3:30:19.120 --> 3:30:22.720]  Greta Thunberg, who is thumbing her nose at all of us
[3:30:22.720 --> 3:30:25.880]  and telling us exactly what to do and what to be.
[3:30:25.880 --> 3:30:27.680]  She's telling all of these adults.
[3:30:27.680 --> 3:30:28.680]  We're gonna go forward.
[3:30:28.680 --> 3:30:30.640]  We're gonna talk a little bit more about this
[3:30:30.640 --> 3:30:33.400]  when we come back in just a minute.
[3:30:33.400 --> 3:30:35.040]  Stick with us in Infowars.
[3:30:35.040 --> 3:30:35.960]  I'm Deanna Lorraine.
[3:30:35.960 --> 3:30:37.240]  We'll be right back.
[3:30:41.240 --> 3:30:42.840]  It was a sleeper product.
[3:30:42.840 --> 3:30:45.720]  It wasn't popular at first, but as people tried it,
[3:30:45.720 --> 3:30:48.040]  it's become one of our top five best sellers.
[3:30:48.040 --> 3:30:50.520]  I'm talking about the eight-pack power stack.
[3:30:50.520 --> 3:30:53.640]  13 different pills filled with super nutrients,
[3:30:53.640 --> 3:30:55.600]  vitamins, minerals, and more
[3:30:55.600 --> 3:30:57.920]  that you take in the morning and one pack and at night.
[3:30:57.920 --> 3:31:01.200]  It's available right now at 60% off
[3:31:01.200 --> 3:31:02.720]  for a limited time when you get it
[3:31:02.720 --> 3:31:06.240]  with Survival Shield X2 that's now back in stock.
[3:31:06.240 --> 3:31:08.800]  This has changed my life and so many other people's lives.
[3:31:08.800 --> 3:31:09.640]  Now, here's the problem.
[3:31:09.640 --> 3:31:11.800]  Some of the patented ingredients
[3:31:11.800 --> 3:31:13.240]  that are in eight-pack power stack
[3:31:13.240 --> 3:31:15.400]  because of the shutdown and the lockdown
[3:31:15.400 --> 3:31:17.680]  are not available for us to even reorder it.
[3:31:17.680 --> 3:31:21.280]  So this could be the last shipment that we ever have.
[3:31:21.280 --> 3:31:22.640]  It's in stock now.

[3:31:36.440 --> 3:31:38.080]  60% off and free shipping.
[3:31:38.080 --> 3:31:40.240]  Biggest deal on this ever.
[3:31:40.240 --> 3:31:43.440]  The social engineers bet on you not having a memory,
[3:31:43.440 --> 3:31:44.360]  more than anything.
[3:31:44.360 --> 3:31:46.800]  They also bet, as they constantly talk about it
[3:31:46.800 --> 3:31:49.920]  in their own words, that you will adapt to being a slave,
[3:31:49.920 --> 3:31:52.880]  that you will learn incrementally to submit.
[3:31:52.880 --> 3:31:56.520]  So think about and remember the phases of the Fauci fraud.
[3:31:56.520 --> 3:31:58.360]  Remember that everything he said
[3:31:58.360 --> 3:32:00.120]  has been a premeditated lie.
[3:32:00.120 --> 3:32:01.960]  They lied about where it came from.
[3:32:01.960 --> 3:32:05.360]  They lied about person to person, the UN covered it all up,
[3:32:05.360 --> 3:32:07.960]  then exaggerated the death rate at 4%.
[3:32:07.960 --> 3:32:12.960]  Well, it's actually 0.032 now and dropping.
[3:32:13.320 --> 3:32:14.720]  Then they set the test up to count
[3:32:14.720 --> 3:32:16.480]  almost all false positives.
[3:32:16.480 --> 3:32:18.920]  They put the names of people that died of other diseases
[3:32:18.920 --> 3:32:20.360]  in the COVID column.
[3:32:20.360 --> 3:32:22.320]  They only said there'd be a 15-day lockdown.
[3:32:22.320 --> 3:32:23.760]  Now we're six months later.
[3:32:23.760 --> 3:32:25.320]  Now they say it's permanent.
[3:32:25.320 --> 3:32:27.760]  You got to wear masks forever and forced inoculations
[3:32:27.760 --> 3:32:29.520]  are coming and they're gonna track everywhere you go
[3:32:29.520 --> 3:32:31.760]  and what you do, the global social credit score
[3:32:31.760 --> 3:32:34.120]  and the UN is the boss and anybody questioning it
[3:32:34.120 --> 3:32:36.400]  is censored off the internet loses their job.
[3:32:36.400 --> 3:32:38.040]  That's called 21st century tyranny.
[3:32:38.040 --> 3:32:39.880]  That's called world government takeover.
[3:32:41.440 --> 3:32:44.040]  Constantly, whether it's the New York Times,
[3:32:44.040 --> 3:32:45.760]  the Washington Post or Howard Stern,
[3:32:45.760 --> 3:32:47.280]  of a group you name it, they come out
[3:32:47.280 --> 3:32:49.040]  and they attack him full war saying,
[3:32:49.040 --> 3:32:51.280]  Jones claims civil war is coming
[3:32:51.280 --> 3:32:55.560]  and financial collapse and planetary lockdowns using viruses
[3:32:55.560 --> 3:32:57.840]  and he tells people they should get off the grid
[3:32:57.840 --> 3:33:01.240]  and get prepared and have horrible food if they can.
[3:33:01.240 --> 3:33:04.160]  And now everything I've warned people about is coming true
[3:33:04.160 --> 3:33:07.240]  because it was all in the Rockefeller Foundation documents
[3:33:07.240 --> 3:33:08.400]  like lockstep.
[3:33:08.400 --> 3:33:11.560]  This is the corporate planetary takeover.
[3:33:11.560 --> 3:33:14.480]  So yes, I stand by what I said 10 years ago,
[3:33:14.480 --> 3:33:16.920]  what I said a year ago and what I said last week

[3:34:36.400 --> 3:34:37.240]  Ah!
[3:34:44.240 --> 3:34:47.240]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[3:34:47.240 --> 3:35:01.400]  I've been waiting so long.
[3:35:01.400 --> 3:35:03.160]  Welcome back to Alex Jones.
[3:35:03.160 --> 3:35:07.200]  This is Deanna Lorraine hosting for the Alex Jones show.
[3:35:07.200 --> 3:35:10.040]  And we are just going over the craziness of this week.
[3:35:10.040 --> 3:35:11.320]  It is the Twilight Zone.
[3:35:11.320 --> 3:35:14.240]  And every day I feel like I'm stuck in a horrible
[3:35:14.240 --> 3:35:16.680]  Arnold Schwarzenegger movie that just doesn't end.
[3:35:16.680 --> 3:35:19.280]  And then it's like combined with Groundhog Day.
[3:35:19.280 --> 3:35:22.160]  And we just can't seem to get out of this nightmare.
[3:35:22.160 --> 3:35:23.360]  But we're doing the best we can.
[3:35:23.360 --> 3:35:25.960]  We're at least having some fun while we're doing it.
[3:35:25.960 --> 3:35:29.160]  So last night, another funny thing happened.
[3:35:29.160 --> 3:35:31.160]  You know, you always have to look at symbolism, right?
[3:35:31.160 --> 3:35:34.160]  We have to look at symbolism and because the, you know,
[3:35:34.160 --> 3:35:36.880]  the deep state, the left, they're all about it.
[3:35:36.880 --> 3:35:41.320]  Last night I noticed something interesting with Pocahontas
[3:35:41.320 --> 3:35:44.120]  with Elizabeth Warren when she was giving her extremely
[3:35:44.120 --> 3:35:45.920]  prepared and rehearsed speech.
[3:35:45.920 --> 3:35:50.000]  She was doing it first of all in a creepy kids kindergarten
[3:35:50.000 --> 3:35:53.560]  daycare slash situation with kids painting in the background
[3:35:53.560 --> 3:35:54.480]  and everything.
[3:35:54.480 --> 3:35:59.160]  But then she also had in block letters BLM spelled out
[3:35:59.160 --> 3:36:02.600]  in the background over her red, over her right shoulder.
[3:36:02.600 --> 3:36:04.480]  I mean, come on, it was so weird.
[3:36:04.480 --> 3:36:08.200]  So if you zoom up there, it spells out BLM.
[3:36:08.200 --> 3:36:11.080]  Oh my God, you're so clever, Pocahontas.
[3:36:11.080 --> 3:36:12.680]  You're so cool.
[3:36:12.680 --> 3:36:14.400]  What is that signaling?
[3:36:14.400 --> 3:36:19.000]  Are they trying to signal an uprising?
[3:36:19.000 --> 3:36:23.280]  I don't know, but how much more of this BLM pandering
[3:36:23.280 --> 3:36:24.480]  can we do, folks?
[3:36:24.480 --> 3:36:27.200]  It's just nonstop.
[3:36:27.200 --> 3:36:30.400]  Now, I was yesterday, I was in a parking lot
[3:36:30.400 --> 3:36:33.840]  and I was videotaping this baby.
[3:36:33.840 --> 3:36:36.080]  You know, there was a couple that was carrying a baby
[3:36:36.080 --> 3:36:38.400]  and the baby had like this shield that was wearing
[3:36:38.400 --> 3:36:40.800]  like this little shield and a hazmat suit.
[3:36:40.800 --> 3:36:42.000]  And I was just videotaping.
[3:36:42.000 --> 3:36:44.120]  I was thinking, wow, what a sad life.
[3:36:44.120 --> 3:36:46.600]  You know, this kid's gonna grow up totally traumatized.
[3:36:46.600 --> 3:36:49.160]  And then all of a sudden, boom, this big black woman
[3:36:49.160 --> 3:36:51.880]  comes up next to me and says, what are you videotaping?
[3:36:51.880 --> 3:36:54.160]  Are you visiting videotaping my car?
[3:36:54.160 --> 3:36:55.640]  What are you videotaping?
[3:36:55.640 --> 3:36:58.520]  And she starts threatening me, getting up in my face,
[3:36:58.520 --> 3:36:59.640]  yelling at me.
[3:36:59.640 --> 3:37:01.960]  And I had to fully convince her for five minutes
[3:37:01.960 --> 3:37:04.880]  that I was not, in fact, videotaping her car.
[3:37:04.880 --> 3:37:08.200]  And so she sat there while she made me go through my phone
[3:37:08.200 --> 3:37:11.280]  and show me her, show her my videos.
[3:37:11.280 --> 3:37:13.120]  And she had little kids with her, a little boy
[3:37:13.120 --> 3:37:15.400]  and a little girl that she was holding their hands with
[3:37:15.400 --> 3:37:16.920]  and screaming at me.
[3:37:16.920 --> 3:37:19.160]  And it just goes to show you how effective
[3:37:19.160 --> 3:37:21.320]  this race war really is.
[3:37:21.320 --> 3:37:22.920]  You know, they're training people,
[3:37:22.920 --> 3:37:24.440]  they're training the whole black community
[3:37:24.440 --> 3:37:27.960]  to literally hate whites, to tell their little boys,
[3:37:27.960 --> 3:37:30.440]  their little girls that white people are bad
[3:37:30.440 --> 3:37:31.760]  and white people are racist
[3:37:31.760 --> 3:37:33.760]  and everything that we do is wrong.
[3:37:33.760 --> 3:37:36.440]  And it's just a sad world because boys and girls,
[3:37:36.440 --> 3:37:38.680]  they're supposed to grow up colorblind.
[3:37:38.680 --> 3:37:40.520]  You know, and they're supposed to think
[3:37:40.520 --> 3:37:42.280]  that everyone loves them, which is true.
[3:37:42.280 --> 3:37:44.800]  But they are fueling these racial tensions.
[3:37:44.800 --> 3:37:49.800]  And notice how BLM, again, is a Marxist organization.
[3:37:50.000 --> 3:37:51.720]  You know it, I know it.
[3:37:51.720 --> 3:37:53.640]  And even in their website, they say,
[3:37:53.640 --> 3:37:57.800]  we are here to disrupt the Western Family Unit, right?
[3:37:57.800 --> 3:38:00.560]  It says they're right there in their website, boom.
[3:38:00.560 --> 3:38:02.640]  And I had a fight with Cardi B about it, too,
[3:38:02.640 --> 3:38:05.280]  the other day, who talked about WAP, you know,
[3:38:05.280 --> 3:38:07.520]  her new single WAP out there.
[3:38:07.520 --> 3:38:09.800]  Of course, Joe Biden had to go and interview her,
[3:38:09.800 --> 3:38:11.040]  not doing any other interviews,
[3:38:11.040 --> 3:38:13.200]  except he's doing it with Cardi B,
[3:38:13.200 --> 3:38:14.360]  which was a big crap show.
[3:38:14.360 --> 3:38:15.800]  If you actually saw this interview,
[3:38:15.800 --> 3:38:17.720]  I didn't even know if she was speaking English.
[3:38:17.720 --> 3:38:18.840]  But this is what's going on.
[3:38:18.840 --> 3:38:23.240]  This is the level of pandering and disunity
[3:38:23.240 --> 3:38:25.960]  they're creating between blacks and whites right now.
[3:38:25.960 --> 3:38:27.040]  It's sick.
[3:38:27.040 --> 3:38:29.080]  Thankfully, a lot of the black community,
[3:38:29.080 --> 3:38:32.480]  they're waking up, they're seeing right through this BS,
[3:38:32.480 --> 3:38:35.360]  but it's pretty bad right now.
[3:38:35.360 --> 3:38:36.840]  And they're gonna continue this,
[3:38:36.840 --> 3:38:40.200]  no matter what, I think it's gonna get a lot worse.
[3:38:40.200 --> 3:38:42.840]  We see, obviously, with the national anthem,
[3:38:42.840 --> 3:38:45.600]  nobody's even standing up for it anymore.
[3:38:45.600 --> 3:38:48.000]  And they will do it, they will keep going for it.
[3:38:48.000 --> 3:38:50.400]  And I think almost the more that President Trump
[3:38:50.400 --> 3:38:52.440]  says stand up for the national anthem,
[3:38:52.440 --> 3:38:53.840]  we're not, you know, I think that people
[3:38:53.840 --> 3:38:55.560]  are doing it out of rebellion.
[3:38:55.560 --> 3:38:58.480]  And by the way, we're gonna talk about in a second, too,
[3:38:58.480 --> 3:39:00.760]  the additional, you know,
[3:39:00.760 --> 3:39:03.520]  scythe of trying to divide the family unit up.
[3:39:03.520 --> 3:39:05.960]  It's all population control.
[3:39:05.960 --> 3:39:07.720]  Oh, there we go, right now.
[3:39:07.720 --> 3:39:11.560]  And just out of curiosity, who here actually likes
[3:39:11.560 --> 3:39:14.720]  looking at sports games and watching sports games
[3:39:14.720 --> 3:39:16.200]  with no fans in there?
[3:39:16.200 --> 3:39:19.040]  They got paper cutouts, they got blowup dolls,
[3:39:19.040 --> 3:39:22.360]  they got digital zoom, superimposed fans out there.
[3:39:22.360 --> 3:39:23.920]  I don't wanna watch that.
[3:39:23.920 --> 3:39:24.760]  I don't wanna see that.
[3:39:24.760 --> 3:39:26.240]  I don't wanna have that be my new normal.
[3:39:26.240 --> 3:39:28.200]  I wanna watch a real baseball games
[3:39:28.200 --> 3:39:30.560]  with fans cheering in the background.
[3:39:30.560 --> 3:39:32.920]  So it's all just a part of this disunity.
[3:39:32.920 --> 3:39:35.120]  You know, they're trying to dehumanize us,
[3:39:35.120 --> 3:39:37.160]  they're trying to take us away from humanity
[3:39:37.160 --> 3:39:39.520]  and have this virtual touchless society.
[3:39:39.520 --> 3:39:41.720]  It's super dystopian, it's super creepy,
[3:39:41.720 --> 3:39:43.960]  but they've laid these plans out for us.
[3:39:43.960 --> 3:39:46.280]  And we're the dumb ones for not actually doing anything
[3:39:46.280 --> 3:39:49.080]  about it when we see these plans in black and white.
[3:39:49.080 --> 3:39:50.440]  They've also just in the last week,
[3:39:50.440 --> 3:39:53.320]  I was joking about this for months on my podcast,
[3:39:53.320 --> 3:39:54.520]  saying that, you know, sooner or later,
[3:39:54.520 --> 3:39:57.560]  they're gonna talk about making a mandatory mass
[3:39:57.560 --> 3:39:59.480]  during sexual relations.
[3:39:59.480 --> 3:40:00.920]  And guess what?
[3:40:00.920 --> 3:40:02.480]  This is not a joke anymore.
[3:40:02.480 --> 3:40:06.840]  They're actually promoting us, kissing, wearing masks,
[3:40:06.840 --> 3:40:10.480]  and having sexual relations wearing a mask.
[3:40:10.480 --> 3:40:12.840]  I'm not exactly sure who's gonna monitor that
[3:40:12.840 --> 3:40:16.480]  or what kind of fine they're gonna enforce on us.
[3:40:16.480 --> 3:40:20.280]  But yeah, they're saying sexual social distancing,
[3:40:20.280 --> 3:40:21.400]  they're actually promoting,
[3:40:21.400 --> 3:40:24.760]  especially on the Canadian government website.
[3:40:24.760 --> 3:40:27.040]  They're saying that we should start having barriers
[3:40:27.040 --> 3:40:29.520]  and walls up during sex.
[3:40:29.520 --> 3:40:31.160]  They're saying, I hope I can say this,
[3:40:31.160 --> 3:40:35.120]  it's a family show, but glory holes during sex.
[3:40:35.120 --> 3:40:38.280]  You know, I mean, how are they promoting this kind of stuff
[3:40:38.280 --> 3:40:40.000]  on a government website?
[3:40:40.000 --> 3:40:41.440]  You know, you can't make this stuff up.
[3:40:41.440 --> 3:40:44.520]  And at the same time, they're saying no kissing
[3:40:44.520 --> 3:40:47.520]  because kissing spreads COVID faster.
[3:40:47.520 --> 3:40:51.960]  So this is just about ushering in virtual reality, right?
[3:40:51.960 --> 3:40:53.880]  Virtual reality sex, porn.
[3:40:53.880 --> 3:40:55.480]  And we know the side effects of this.
[3:40:55.480 --> 3:40:59.480]  We know the long-term repercussions of a society
[3:40:59.480 --> 3:41:03.080]  that's addicted to virtual reality and porn and everything.
[3:41:03.080 --> 3:41:05.200]  You know, people think, oh, this is just,
[3:41:05.200 --> 3:41:06.360]  this is just in the meantime.
[3:41:06.360 --> 3:41:08.240]  This is just to get us through this pandemic.
[3:41:08.240 --> 3:41:09.240]  And they're gonna go with it
[3:41:09.240 --> 3:41:11.160]  because they're just such sheep.
[3:41:11.160 --> 3:41:13.600]  But this is not just a temporary situation.
[3:41:13.600 --> 3:41:16.320]  What they're trying to do is get us used to this.
[3:41:16.320 --> 3:41:18.720]  They're trying to get us used to this virtual world,
[3:41:18.720 --> 3:41:22.520]  this touchless society where we're lacking humanity.
[3:41:22.520 --> 3:41:23.360]  I don't know about you,
[3:41:23.360 --> 3:41:27.040]  but I can't even watch another Zoom conference
[3:41:27.040 --> 3:41:28.280]  to save my life.
[3:41:28.280 --> 3:41:30.080]  A friend of mine had a bachelorette party
[3:41:30.080 --> 3:41:31.480]  a couple of weeks ago on Zoom.
[3:41:31.480 --> 3:41:32.400]  I'm like, are you kidding me?
[3:41:32.400 --> 3:41:33.760]  I can't do this anymore.
[3:41:33.760 --> 3:41:36.040]  I don't wanna watch people on Zoom anymore.
[3:41:36.040 --> 3:41:37.160]  I wanna see you guys.
[3:41:37.160 --> 3:41:38.240]  I wanna touch you guys.
[3:41:38.240 --> 3:41:40.600]  I mean, this is the society that we were raised.
[3:41:40.600 --> 3:41:42.640]  We're raised to be social creatures
[3:41:42.640 --> 3:41:45.680]  and they wanna strip us all of that kind of humanity.
[3:41:45.680 --> 3:41:47.880]  So that's why we can't get used to it.
[3:41:47.880 --> 3:41:49.400]  We have to fight.
[3:41:49.400 --> 3:41:52.120]  You know, President Trump, he's just one man.
[3:41:52.120 --> 3:41:53.840]  Everyone says they're waiting for this plan.
[3:41:53.840 --> 3:41:55.360]  They're waiting for President Trump.
[3:41:55.360 --> 3:41:56.360]  That's great.
[3:41:56.360 --> 3:41:58.080]  President Trump's a powerful man.
[3:41:58.080 --> 3:42:01.120]  But at the end of the day, he is just one man, okay?
[3:42:01.120 --> 3:42:05.960]  We are the people and we are supposed to be having the power
[3:42:05.960 --> 3:42:09.040]  and the government is supposed to be afraid of its people.
[3:42:09.040 --> 3:42:11.160]  We're not supposed to be afraid of the government.
[3:42:11.160 --> 3:42:13.480]  Just like what V for Vendetta says,
[3:42:13.480 --> 3:42:16.000]  we're supposed to be having the power
[3:42:16.000 --> 3:42:17.800]  and people have forgotten that.
[3:42:17.800 --> 3:42:19.760]  People have forgotten how to rise up.
[3:42:19.760 --> 3:42:22.440]  The deep state, the left, they're so well mobilized.
[3:42:22.440 --> 3:42:24.040]  They're so well funded.
[3:42:24.040 --> 3:42:27.120]  And while we're having some nice rallies on the weekends
[3:42:27.120 --> 3:42:29.560]  and honking horns, waving American flags,
[3:42:29.560 --> 3:42:32.160]  they are literally seizing police stations,
[3:42:32.160 --> 3:42:35.560]  ripping down monuments and erasing our culture.
[3:42:35.560 --> 3:42:38.800]  And by the way, we're gonna go to Chris Cuomo,
[3:42:38.800 --> 3:42:42.040]  or sorry, his brother, Andrew Cuomo's speech in a second.
[3:42:42.040 --> 3:42:46.160]  We're gonna see what he really thinks about his job
[3:42:46.160 --> 3:42:49.360]  as New York governor handling the coronavirus.
[3:42:49.360 --> 3:42:51.040]  So let's look at that little speech last night,
[3:42:51.040 --> 3:42:52.480]  just a little clip of it.
[3:42:52.480 --> 3:42:56.480]  Hello, today's Monday, day 170.
[3:42:56.480 --> 3:42:59.200]  New Yorkers were ground zero for the COVID virus.
[3:42:59.200 --> 3:43:01.680]  And have gone from one of the highest infection rates
[3:43:01.680 --> 3:43:04.040]  on the globe to one of the lowest.
[3:43:04.040 --> 3:43:06.160]  We climbed the impossible mountain,
[3:43:06.160 --> 3:43:08.600]  and right now we are on the other side.
[3:43:08.600 --> 3:43:11.480]  We did it with the kindness and assistance of so many.
[3:43:11.480 --> 3:43:13.360]  New Yorkers want to thank everyone
[3:43:13.360 --> 3:43:16.560]  who came to our aid, 30,000 Americans
[3:43:16.560 --> 3:43:20.560]  who volunteered to come here to help in our hour of need.
[3:43:20.560 --> 3:43:23.880]  Your love gave us the strength to carry on.
[3:43:23.880 --> 3:43:27.160]  We went through hell, but we've learned much.
[3:43:27.160 --> 3:43:29.720]  We know that our problems go beyond the COVID virus.
[3:43:29.720 --> 3:43:32.880]  COVID is the symptom, not the illness.
[3:43:32.880 --> 3:43:33.720]  What?
[3:43:33.720 --> 3:43:35.120]  Our nation is in crisis.
[3:43:35.120 --> 3:43:38.520]  And in many ways, COVID is just a metaphor.
[3:43:38.520 --> 3:43:41.440]  A virus attacks when the body is weak,
[3:43:41.440 --> 3:43:43.400]  and when it cannot defend itself.
[3:43:44.240 --> 3:43:45.520]  Over these past few years,
[3:43:45.520 --> 3:43:48.200]  America's body politic has been weakened.
[3:43:48.200 --> 3:43:49.880]  The divisions have been growing deeper.
[3:43:49.880 --> 3:43:52.000]  The anti-Semitism, the anti-Latino,
[3:43:52.000 --> 3:43:55.320]  the anti-immigrant fervor, the racism in Charlottesville,
[3:43:55.320 --> 3:43:59.520]  where the KKK didn't even bother to wear their hoods,
[3:43:59.520 --> 3:44:03.760]  and in Minnesota, where the life was squeezed from Mr. Floyd.
[3:44:04.600 --> 3:44:08.040]  Only a strong body can fight off the virus,
[3:44:08.040 --> 3:44:10.240]  and America's divisions weakened it.
[3:44:11.120 --> 3:44:15.320]  Donald Trump didn't create the initial division.
[3:44:15.320 --> 3:44:18.520]  The division created Trump.
[3:44:18.520 --> 3:44:20.240]  He only made it worse.
[3:44:20.240 --> 3:44:21.080]  I can't even.
[3:44:21.080 --> 3:44:23.480]  Our collective strength is exercised through government.
[3:44:23.480 --> 3:44:25.560]  It is, in effect, our immune system.
[3:44:25.560 --> 3:44:26.400]  Get this guy away from me.
[3:44:26.400 --> 3:44:28.800]  And our current federal government is dysfunctional.
[3:44:28.800 --> 3:44:30.120]  It's so bad.
[3:44:30.120 --> 3:44:33.080]  It's like, we should play a drinking game.
[3:44:33.080 --> 3:44:36.560]  How many times can they say, soul of this nation?
[3:44:36.560 --> 3:44:40.520]  How many times can they tie KKK into coronavirus
[3:44:40.520 --> 3:44:42.080]  and talk about white hoods?
[3:44:42.080 --> 3:44:45.360]  But they're saying it right there, guys.
[3:44:45.360 --> 3:44:48.600]  They're saying coronavirus is a metaphor.
[3:44:48.600 --> 3:44:50.800]  The coronavirus is the symptom.
[3:44:50.800 --> 3:44:52.800]  It's not the illness, it's not the problem.
[3:44:52.800 --> 3:44:55.200]  They're telling you right there, it's not real.
[3:44:55.200 --> 3:44:58.600]  How many more signs do we have to know, guys?
[3:44:58.600 --> 3:45:00.360]  Anyone who's still believing
[3:45:00.360 --> 3:45:03.640]  this is a real serious deadly virus,
[3:45:03.640 --> 3:45:05.040]  I got some problems for you.
[3:45:05.040 --> 3:45:07.440]  Okay, guys, thank you so much for watching.
[3:45:07.440 --> 3:45:08.480]  I'm Deanna Lorraine.
[3:45:08.480 --> 3:45:12.440]  You can pick up my book, Taking Back America, on Amazon,
[3:45:12.440 --> 3:45:14.840]  but maybe better than to sporting Jeff Bezos.
[3:45:14.840 --> 3:45:17.640]  We can connect it with InfoWare sometime in the near future.
[3:45:17.640 --> 3:45:19.120]  So thanks so much for watching.
[3:45:19.120 --> 3:45:20.960]  This is the Alex Jones Show.
[3:45:20.960 --> 3:45:23.400]  This is Deanna Lorraine hosting for him,
[3:45:23.400 --> 3:45:25.720]  and we'll be back in just a few minutes.
[3:45:25.720 --> 3:45:51.720]  Thank you so much for watching.
