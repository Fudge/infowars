[00:00.000 --> 00:12.000]  Big Brother mainstream media government cover-ups you want answers well so does he
[00:12.000 --> 00:22.000]  he's Alex Jones on the GCN radio network and now live from Austin Texas Alex Jones
[00:22.000 --> 00:31.000]  it is Friday July 16th 2010 Bob Chapman joins us for about 40 minutes coming up
[00:31.000 --> 00:35.000]  in the next hour to break down what's happening with the economy as he does
[00:35.000 --> 00:41.000]  every Friday and I have all the vital stacks of news and information here in
[00:41.000 --> 00:45.000]  front of me that we're going to be covering BP claims for the first time
[00:45.000 --> 00:51.000]  in 80 plus days that they have stopped the leak and I pray that they're not lying
[00:51.000 --> 00:56.000]  because they've said this at least three times that I can remember in the last
[00:56.000 --> 01:04.000]  87 plus days so we'll be breaking that down I was here in the office last night
[01:04.000 --> 01:10.000]  when Aaron Dykes and I were doing research for the full spectrum dominance eugenics
[01:10.000 --> 01:16.000]  film that we are working on that deals with chemtrails and other issues and we
[01:16.000 --> 01:22.000]  have come across so much more information that our awareness of the globalist
[01:22.000 --> 01:28.000]  master plan is is growing exponentially don't think that you ever know
[01:28.000 --> 01:33.000]  everything the more we learn the more horrified we get to discover that things
[01:33.000 --> 01:38.000]  are far worse than we originally thought so I sent the Rockefeller Foundation
[01:38.000 --> 01:44.000]  document over to Paul Watson he wrote a story about it this morning and just
[01:44.000 --> 01:48.000]  everything we talk about here the magnitude is off the chart I mean I'm
[01:48.000 --> 01:52.000]  not even worthy to be bringing you information this powerful and I hope
[01:52.000 --> 01:58.000]  that you pay attention to what we cover here minute by minute because I've had
[01:58.000 --> 02:03.000]  chills since last night this just confirms everything else we've already
[02:03.000 --> 02:10.000]  researched but Rockefeller study envisions future dictatorship controlled by
[02:10.000 --> 02:15.000]  state millions being killed mandatory quarantines checkpoints the end of the
[02:15.000 --> 02:21.000]  family everything that's in the other documents but this dovetails with all
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.000]  the other Rockefeller Foundation documents about the GMO food to sterilize
[02:24.000 --> 02:28.000]  you in the force vaccines and the hell we're already living in that's just
[02:28.000 --> 02:32.000]  going to continue to intensify until we take our governments back from these
[02:32.000 --> 02:38.000]  eugenics madmen but that story is up on prisonplanet.com we sent this to
[02:38.000 --> 02:41.000]  Watson and let it to report on it today Rockefeller study envisions future
[02:41.000 --> 02:45.000]  dictatorship controlled by the elite and I want to go through a bunch of other
[02:45.000 --> 02:51.000]  news I mean here's Mark Moreno one of the top advisors to the Republican caucus
[02:51.000 --> 02:56.000]  so that a lot of powerful people now paying attention finally population
[02:56.000 --> 03:00.000]  control advocate wanted to sterilize population through food and water
[03:00.000 --> 03:05.000]  that's climate depot so of course we've been covering this for well well over
[03:05.000 --> 03:10.000]  14 15 years but now it's finally starting to become mainstream news the
[03:10.000 --> 03:14.000]  question is will you have the courage to really do the research yourself
[03:14.000 --> 03:20.000]  because I don't want you to just sit here and hear me make these claims when I
[03:20.000 --> 03:24.000]  tell you that they're saturating almost all the major food crops with sodium
[03:24.000 --> 03:30.000]  fluoride it it concentrates in the food to levels thousands of times in many
[03:30.000 --> 03:35.000]  cases above what's in the water I mean one part per million is devastating
[03:35.000 --> 03:41.000]  900 parts per million and powdered eggs is just off the charts total brain
[03:41.000 --> 03:45.000]  damage and the hundreds of parts per million and many of the food crops now
[03:45.000 --> 03:49.000]  and that's not just to mention the fact that these crops can also absorb
[03:49.000 --> 03:53.000]  pesticides and are designed to live in pesticides and that concentrates in them
[03:53.000 --> 03:58.000]  or that the DNA has been altered to also a cost sterilization I mean they're
[03:58.000 --> 04:02.000]  hitting us on so many fronts and I've got all the government reports admitting
[04:02.000 --> 04:06.000]  that the births year by year they're studying that human DNA is being damaged
[04:06.000 --> 04:11.000]  at a level never before seen we are being mutated and many of us that are
[04:11.000 --> 04:16.000]  able to even think and operate today our children their children and the
[04:16.000 --> 04:20.000]  children after them are going to be deformed monsters who are literally
[04:20.000 --> 04:24.000]  drooling basket cases but of course that will never even get to that point
[04:24.000 --> 04:28.000]  they plan to exterminate all of us long before then it's just an absolute fact
[04:28.000 --> 04:33.000]  and why do we have to sit here and fight with each other government bureaucrats
[04:33.000 --> 04:39.000]  police military everybody I mean we're all in this together it's a tiny elite
[04:39.000 --> 04:48.000]  less than 6,000 globalist in their own analysis that rule the planet and look
[04:48.000 --> 04:53.000]  I'm gonna get it all the news coming up in your phone calls today it's just
[04:53.000 --> 04:57.000]  this is so horrible they're collapsing the economy so they can take control
[04:57.000 --> 05:01.000]  of us to the government health care system and soft kill us hello this is
[05:01.000 --> 05:05.000]  Alex Jones with some important questions if you're going into a battle and they

[07:02.000 --> 07:06.000]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily
[07:06.000 --> 07:10.000]  double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants
[07:10.000 --> 07:14.000]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[07:14.000 --> 07:18.000]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[07:18.000 --> 07:22.000]  is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[07:22.000 --> 07:26.000]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[07:26.000 --> 07:30.000]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[07:30.000 --> 07:34.000]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[07:34.000 --> 07:38.000]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup
[07:38.000 --> 07:42.000]  insurance and peace of mind folks I really believe in the solar power generators
[07:42.000 --> 07:46.000]  offered by solutions from science one of my oldest sponsors you can get more

[08:04.000 --> 08:08.000]  we now take you live to the central texas command center
[08:08.000 --> 08:12.000]  and the heart of the resistance you're listening to the alex
[08:12.000 --> 08:16.000]  jones show
[08:16.000 --> 08:20.000]  it is friday we cover the real issues here on this broadcast
[08:20.000 --> 08:24.000]  I'll be back of course this sunday four to six p.m. with the abbreviated sunday
[08:24.000 --> 08:28.000]  transmission
[08:28.000 --> 08:32.000]  again I want to thank you for joining us
[08:32.000 --> 08:36.000]  I want you to know that I do have a great weight on me
[08:36.000 --> 08:40.000]  with knowledge comes great sorrow the bible says
[08:40.000 --> 08:44.000]  and but with knowledge also comes
[08:44.000 --> 08:48.000]  the power to be able to protect yourself and your family
[08:48.000 --> 08:52.000]  and to have a healthier society when we don't struggle for
[08:52.000 --> 08:56.000]  a more just and pure society
[08:56.000 --> 09:00.000]  and when we stop recognizing good from evil
[09:00.000 --> 09:04.000]  we always see the decline of civilization and the most wicked the most abusive
[09:04.000 --> 09:08.000]  the most sadistic the most psychopathic take control
[09:08.000 --> 09:12.000]  I want to get into eugenics today
[09:12.000 --> 09:16.000]  coming up later in the hour and throughout
[09:16.000 --> 09:20.000]  the broadcast because there's been a lot of information coming out even the mainstream
[09:20.000 --> 09:24.000]  media just further documenting everything that we discussed here and I
[09:24.000 --> 09:28.000]  I want you today to really meditate
[09:28.000 --> 09:32.000]  focus to to cogitate
[09:32.000 --> 09:36.000]  to think about the issues we're laying out here we are living in the middle of
[09:36.000 --> 09:40.000]  an orchestrated collapse the united states has been
[09:40.000 --> 09:44.000]  in a major depression many more economists
[09:44.000 --> 09:48.000]  every day come out and admit that that is the case
[09:48.000 --> 09:52.000]  even yahoo finance today is admitting that all the numbers show that the middle class is being
[09:52.000 --> 09:56.000]  eradicated and that globalization is the cause
[09:56.000 --> 10:00.000]  and they call it a nasty side effect
[10:00.000 --> 10:04.000]  no it is not a side effect
[10:04.000 --> 10:08.000]  if an executioner walks you up onto a platform and puts your neck in a noose and pulls the lever
[10:08.000 --> 10:12.000]  and the floor falls out from beneath you and you fall six feet
[10:12.000 --> 10:16.000]  and the acceleration snaps your neck
[10:16.000 --> 10:20.000]  death is not a side effect death
[10:20.000 --> 10:24.000]  was the goal
[10:24.000 --> 10:28.000]  orchestrated financial collapse is so important is it ties into the government
[10:28.000 --> 10:32.000]  healthcare which in the globalist own documents and statements is meant to set up
[10:32.000 --> 10:36.000]  a genetic dictatorship a
[10:36.000 --> 10:40.000]  dictatorship over life and death a government sponsored and
[10:40.000 --> 10:44.000]  pushed euthanasia one child policies
[10:44.000 --> 10:48.000]  being dependent on these psychopaths
[10:48.000 --> 10:52.000]  these people who like to play god
[10:52.000 --> 10:56.000]  being dependent on them
[10:56.000 --> 11:00.000]  is death and it is slow creeping
[11:00.000 --> 11:04.000]  incremental orchestrated death
[11:08.000 --> 11:12.000]  if you put poison
[11:12.000 --> 11:16.000]  there are many poisons that are undetectable
[11:16.000 --> 11:20.000]  to the taste buds or to the nostrils to the olfactory nerve
[11:20.000 --> 11:24.000]  if you put poison say in a
[11:24.000 --> 11:28.000]  African
[11:28.000 --> 11:32.000]  savanna water hole the elephants the lions
[11:32.000 --> 11:36.000]  the zebras the giraffes the baboons
[11:36.000 --> 11:40.000]  the wild African dogs they will all come to the
[11:40.000 --> 11:44.000]  water hole the hippopotamus they will drink from it
[11:44.000 --> 11:48.000]  and they will die and even as they see their fellow lions
[11:48.000 --> 11:52.000]  and elephants and baboons dying
[11:52.000 --> 11:56.000]  they will continue to drink because they are
[11:56.000 --> 12:00.000]  not conscious
[12:00.000 --> 12:04.000]  creatures who are able to scientifically
[12:04.000 --> 12:08.000]  analyze what's happening to them and the globalists see you
[12:08.000 --> 12:12.000]  as animals they believe that you are incapable of
[12:12.000 --> 12:16.000]  looking around you and seeing the design even
[12:16.000 --> 12:20.000]  when it is in hundreds
[12:20.000 --> 12:24.000]  and hundreds of government funded
[12:24.000 --> 12:28.000]  policy reports
[12:28.000 --> 12:32.000]  policy directives policy plans
[12:32.000 --> 12:36.000]  there are so many
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.000]  of these reports that Aaron digs
[12:40.000 --> 12:44.000]  only aided by coffee
[12:44.000 --> 12:48.000]  many days will not
[12:48.000 --> 12:52.000]  sleep and I have to make him go home after two days of being up here
[12:52.000 --> 12:56.000]  this is somebody I hired right out of the University of Texas five years ago
[12:56.000 --> 13:00.000]  who didn't really believe in what I was doing
[13:00.000 --> 13:04.000]  who didn't really buy what I was saying and kind of laughed when I hired him
[13:04.000 --> 13:08.000]  that's exactly who I wanted to hire
[13:08.000 --> 13:12.000]  I wanted him to see it and he'd gone to
[13:12.000 --> 13:16.000]  the public relations school
[13:16.000 --> 13:20.000]  he had very good grades when he graduated he was very intelligent and I said
[13:20.000 --> 13:24.000]  you are going to see the dark side
[13:24.000 --> 13:28.000]  now he is so obsessed with reading hundreds of reports on how they are
[13:28.000 --> 13:32.000]  poisoning the water, the food, how they are spraying us via aircraft
[13:32.000 --> 13:36.000]  the Rockefeller studies, the books on eugenics
[13:36.000 --> 13:40.000]  written by the globalist that he is probably the only other person
[13:40.000 --> 13:44.000]  in this office who has reached the level of my understanding
[13:44.000 --> 13:48.000]  and perhaps dealing with eugenics even surpassed it
[13:48.000 --> 13:52.000]  and every day he says look at this
[13:52.000 --> 13:56.000]  this is another Rockefeller foundation report and I said send it to Watson
[13:56.000 --> 14:00.000]  you are going home it's midnight you are going home
[14:00.000 --> 14:04.000]  you are not writing an article on this send it to Watson he'll do it
[14:04.000 --> 14:08.000]  and you know what that's a normal response
[14:08.000 --> 14:12.000]  Aaron he's normal he's got his head screwed on straight
[14:12.000 --> 14:16.000]  you can't read government documents where they brag going back 60 years
[14:16.000 --> 14:20.000]  how they are poisoning the water and the food over 60 years ago how they would genetically engineer
[14:20.000 --> 14:24.000]  crops when they discovered the double helix and discovered DNA
[14:24.000 --> 14:28.000]  and how they would create binary weapons and other degenerative weapons
[14:28.000 --> 14:32.000]  that take time and that mix with other poisons
[14:32.000 --> 14:36.000]  and bioagents that have been introduced
[14:36.000 --> 14:40.000]  which compartmentalize doctor or even specialist can't recognize it
[14:40.000 --> 14:44.000]  though there are now thousands of doctors and chemists and scientists that have reverse engineered
[14:44.000 --> 14:48.000]  what's going on and have gone public but you don't have to reverse engineer it
[14:48.000 --> 14:52.000]  these people are so arrogant that they write policy papers so many of them
[14:52.000 --> 14:56.000]  that they are producing these policy papers and reports and white papers
[14:56.000 --> 15:00.000]  so fast
[15:00.000 --> 15:04.000]  so fast
[15:04.000 --> 15:08.000]  and you could never read them all
[15:08.000 --> 15:12.000]  a group of just two or three people here in my office that research this
[15:12.000 --> 15:16.000]  we could never read them all it is warehouses full of it
[15:16.000 --> 15:20.000]  it is an open conspiracy against you and your family
[15:20.000 --> 15:24.000]  I pray to God
[15:24.000 --> 15:28.000]  I pray to my heavenly Father Jesus Christ every night to give me the strength
[15:28.000 --> 15:32.000]  and the will to be able to face this horror
[15:32.000 --> 15:36.000]  and the strength to carry on because I know why a lot of you
[15:36.000 --> 15:40.000]  don't want to look at this information and just want to comment on the YouTube videos
[15:40.000 --> 15:44.000]  or on message boards and I'm a liar
[15:44.000 --> 15:48.000]  I know why because it's scary and if you admit this to yourself
[15:48.000 --> 15:52.000]  you're not going to be able to go to the ball games anymore
[15:52.000 --> 15:56.000]  you're not going to be able to just go out and get drunk with your friends
[15:56.000 --> 16:00.000]  you're not going to be able to just go out and enjoy yourself all the time
[16:00.000 --> 16:04.000]  you're wasting this and once you face this information
[16:04.000 --> 16:08.000]  once you've consciously admitted it to yourself it will take over your life
[16:08.000 --> 16:12.000]  it should take over your life
[16:12.000 --> 16:16.000]  what else could it do
[16:16.000 --> 16:20.000]  the only chance we've got of beating this scientific
[16:20.000 --> 16:24.000]  dictatorship, this creeping death
[16:24.000 --> 16:28.000]  that takes its time to incrementally enslave you
[16:28.000 --> 16:32.000]  psychologically, physically, spiritually
[16:32.000 --> 16:36.000]  the only way to defeat it is for the
[16:36.000 --> 16:40.000]  rank and file of this planet to realize that
[16:40.000 --> 16:44.000]  you have a choice to make on what your destiny is going to be
[16:44.000 --> 16:48.000]  when loser draw you need to choose a side
[16:48.000 --> 16:52.000]  you need to spend some time this afternoon
[16:52.000 --> 16:56.000]  this evening over the weekend
[16:56.000 --> 17:00.000]  to close the shutters, to sit there in your easy chair
[17:00.000 --> 17:04.000]  and to just sit back
[17:04.000 --> 17:08.000]  and think about the claims I've made here and decide
[17:08.000 --> 17:12.000]  on whether or not you're going to research the information we've laid out
[17:12.000 --> 17:16.000]  because this information is too important, I do not want you to simply sit here
[17:16.000 --> 17:20.000]  and listen to what I've said and then go out on message boards and say
[17:20.000 --> 17:24.000]  Alex Jones says they want to reduce our population
[17:24.000 --> 17:28.000]  and that they're incrementally increasing the amount of
[17:28.000 --> 17:32.000]  poisons and genetic manipulation that's going on
[17:32.000 --> 17:36.000]  oh
[17:36.000 --> 17:40.000]  oh
[17:40.000 --> 17:44.000]  oh
[17:44.000 --> 17:48.000]  oh
[17:48.000 --> 17:52.000]  oh
[17:52.000 --> 17:56.000]  we've got to get past the artificial stigma that the control corporate
[17:56.000 --> 18:00.000]  media has been putting out for decades ahead of their open
[18:00.000 --> 18:04.000]  opening of planetary dictatorship
[18:04.000 --> 18:08.000]  whether it's the Rockefeller report we were reading last night that we're linked to
[18:08.000 --> 18:12.000]  on PrismPlanet.com or whether it's
[18:12.000 --> 18:16.000]  Ecoscience or whether it's Time Magazine saying only
[18:16.000 --> 18:20.000]  have one child, it's good for the environment
[18:24.000 --> 18:28.000]  they all talk about how we need a police state to carry this
[18:28.000 --> 18:32.000]  out, they're now in hundreds of publications the last six months
[18:32.000 --> 18:36.000]  in the British and US and European newspapers and Australian as well saying you know what
[18:36.000 --> 18:40.000]  the public's too stupid to agree to one child policies and euthanasia and all
[18:40.000 --> 18:44.000]  this, we need a planetary police state that's their quote over and over
[18:44.000 --> 18:48.000]  again to carry out this great work
[18:48.000 --> 18:52.000]  they're being public about it, in fact I'm going to
[18:52.000 --> 18:56.000]  come back from break here in a minute and I'm going to go ahead and get into this
[18:56.000 --> 19:00.000]  first the whole eugenics and just what's on my plate
[19:00.000 --> 19:04.000]  today, just what's in the mainstream news today
[19:04.000 --> 19:08.000]  and when I make the point that without even looking
[19:08.000 --> 19:12.000]  we're not even looking for this stuff, it's just everywhere, this is their religion
[19:12.000 --> 19:16.000]  this is their system, this is their methodology
[19:16.000 --> 19:20.000]  their way of life, what they believe in
[19:20.000 --> 19:24.000]  and even your average yuppie who's under this scientific
[19:24.000 --> 19:28.000]  attack knows that the received knowledge and wisdom
[19:28.000 --> 19:32.000]  that their false common sense is yeah there's too many people and you tell a yuppie
[19:32.000 --> 19:36.000]  about other foods being poisoned, well there are too many people, you fool, they're hitting you too
[19:36.000 --> 19:40.000]  they like automatically think because they buy into it at a lower
[19:40.000 --> 19:44.000]  level, kind of an outer cult
[19:44.000 --> 19:48.000]  member that it makes it okay, it's not okay
[19:48.000 --> 19:52.000]  and the globalists are not doing this for the environment
[19:52.000 --> 19:56.000]  they are destroying the environment, they are rewriting the entire
[19:56.000 --> 20:00.000]  genetic code of the planet right now, you don't understand that
[20:00.000 --> 20:04.000]  hounded by debt collectors with phone calls and letters
[20:04.000 --> 20:08.000]  thinking of calling a debt relief company, don't greedy lawyers
[20:08.000 --> 20:12.000]  and debt companies charge thousands, why pay

[20:56.000 --> 21:00.000]  800-405-7850
[21:00.000 --> 21:04.000]  the economy is crumbling
[21:04.000 --> 21:08.000]  debt soaring and the possibility of World War 3 is increasing
[21:08.000 --> 21:12.000]  I started survivalistseeds.com from my dining room table
[21:12.000 --> 21:16.000]  with a small bucket of seed and a single rotating

[22:08.000 --> 22:12.000]  I get it, you wouldn't buy gold if you believed that the government is doing a great job
[22:12.000 --> 22:16.000]  and that the Fed will stop handing out trillions of dollars like bailout candy
[22:16.000 --> 22:20.000]  that social security would be there for you, that's not what's happening
[22:20.000 --> 22:24.000]  you might even pass on gold if the stimulus package wouldn't fuel inflation
[22:24.000 --> 22:28.000]  or that the dollar wouldn't lose value or that your retirement would be secure
[22:28.000 --> 22:32.000]  if all looks rosy to you then now is not the time to buy gold
[22:32.000 --> 22:36.000]  for the realists there have never been more sobering reasons to diversify with gold
[22:36.000 --> 22:40.000]  since 2001 the US dollar index has tanked 30% while gold
[22:40.000 --> 22:44.000]  hasn't 300% right now savvy investors are adding gold to their portfolios

[24:10.000 --> 24:13.000]  but I've been seen with Farrah
[24:13.000 --> 24:16.000]  I've never been with anything less than an eye
[24:16.000 --> 24:18.000]  so fine
[24:18.000 --> 24:24.000]  what I'm going to do is I'm going to get into eugenics at the bottom of the next hour
[24:24.000 --> 24:27.000]  so I've got so many articles from just today
[24:27.000 --> 24:30.000]  I'm going to go over them some more before I even cover them
[24:30.000 --> 24:33.000]  and really lay out the facts for people
[24:33.000 --> 24:36.000]  but the bottom line is this
[24:36.000 --> 24:38.000]  you have a decision to make
[24:38.000 --> 24:41.000]  are you going to let all the distractions and the diversions
[24:41.000 --> 24:44.000]  and the things that don't matter that are purposefully
[24:44.000 --> 24:47.000]  set out in front of you to distract you
[24:47.000 --> 24:49.000]  and to disempower you
[24:49.000 --> 24:51.000]  and to blind you from what's really happening
[24:51.000 --> 24:57.000]  are you going to let this scientific dictatorship succeed
[24:57.000 --> 25:00.000]  are you going to feed your children
[25:00.000 --> 25:04.000]  adulterated poisoned food and water by design
[25:04.000 --> 25:08.000]  are you going to give them poisoned drugs by design
[25:08.000 --> 25:11.000]  are you going to give them vaccines made in China
[25:11.000 --> 25:14.000]  that are designed to destroy their immune systems
[25:14.000 --> 25:17.000]  and give them cancer and reduce their fertility
[25:17.000 --> 25:19.000]  by design
[25:19.000 --> 25:21.000]  are you going to do the research and find out
[25:21.000 --> 25:24.000]  that aspartame is causing lower birth weights
[25:24.000 --> 25:29.000]  anywhere the artificial sweetener is consumed
[25:29.000 --> 25:31.000]  and causing miscarriages
[25:31.000 --> 25:37.000]  in the studies in the 70s and in new studies out by major governments
[25:37.000 --> 25:40.000]  I mean how do these women out there
[25:40.000 --> 25:42.000]  when everybody's heard aspartame is bad for you
[25:42.000 --> 25:44.000]  at least you've heard that
[25:44.000 --> 25:48.000]  how do these women and these husbands not go research it
[25:48.000 --> 25:50.000]  well I'll tell you why it's addictive
[25:50.000 --> 25:52.000]  you tell somebody who drinks aspartame soft drinks
[25:52.000 --> 25:54.000]  or choose aspartame gum
[25:54.000 --> 25:57.000]  almost every brand of even sugar gum has it added
[25:57.000 --> 25:59.000]  they're highly addicted
[25:59.000 --> 26:01.000]  that's why they'll say no not my drink
[26:01.000 --> 26:04.000]  no not my chips with MSG
[26:04.000 --> 26:07.000]  not only are the poisons they put in the food deadly
[26:07.000 --> 26:09.000]  but they're also addictive
[26:09.000 --> 26:14.000]  many poisons in the metabolic system of humans and animals
[26:14.000 --> 26:18.000]  become addictive
[26:18.000 --> 26:20.000]  of course in the 18th and 19th
[26:20.000 --> 26:22.000]  and even in the 20th century
[26:22.000 --> 26:27.000]  one of the most popular forms of speed
[26:27.000 --> 26:34.000]  was just old-fashioned poisons
[26:34.000 --> 26:37.000]  and it becomes very very addictive arsenic
[26:37.000 --> 26:40.000]  in fact people won't believe that search engine
[26:40.000 --> 26:43.000]  arsenic as a drug or arsenic addiction
[26:43.000 --> 26:46.000]  and just throw up the first mainstream article
[26:46.000 --> 26:48.000]  or government document for them watching at
[26:48.000 --> 26:49.000]  prisonplanet.tv
[26:49.000 --> 26:52.000]  you're a radio listener you can just search engine that term
[26:52.000 --> 26:55.000]  these excitotoxins and we've had brain surgeons
[26:55.000 --> 26:58.000]  and neurologist and toxicologist and biologist
[26:58.000 --> 27:00.000]  on to explain and they knew this
[27:00.000 --> 27:02.000]  they tested all of these food additives
[27:02.000 --> 27:05.000]  in the last 80 plus years this was going on since the 20s
[27:05.000 --> 27:08.000]  so really 90 years from the studies we've seen
[27:08.000 --> 27:10.000]  and they found out that rats
[27:10.000 --> 27:13.000]  which their metabolic system is the most closely akin to humans
[27:13.000 --> 27:17.000]  pigs are almost
[27:17.000 --> 27:22.000]  as similar in the reactions that rats and pigs have
[27:22.000 --> 27:26.000]  to drugs and to chemicals and to poisons
[27:26.000 --> 27:31.000]  that's why they use pig hearts in heart transplants
[27:31.000 --> 27:33.000]  that's better than baboon
[27:33.000 --> 27:35.000]  that's why they use pig ventricles
[27:35.000 --> 27:39.000]  because they found that in many cases they don't
[27:39.000 --> 27:44.000]  reject them as often as they would even
[27:44.000 --> 27:47.000]  reject a human heart in a heart transplant
[27:47.000 --> 27:50.000]  but the issue is they've tested all of this
[27:50.000 --> 27:52.000]  and the scientists in these studies
[27:52.000 --> 27:54.000]  in some cases you read in their papers
[27:54.000 --> 27:57.000]  we've done some interviews with these people in the upcoming film
[27:57.000 --> 27:59.000]  and they're told look don't worry about it
[27:59.000 --> 28:03.000]  if this study shows that this GMO rat feed
[28:03.000 --> 28:07.000]  is sterilizing more than half the first generation
[28:07.000 --> 28:11.000]  over 80% the second almost all of them are sterile
[28:11.000 --> 28:13.000]  by the third and the fourth deformities
[28:13.000 --> 28:15.000]  don't worry there's too many people
[28:15.000 --> 28:18.000]  just keep your mouth shut
[28:22.000 --> 28:25.000]  and of course we've had scientists on and named names
[28:25.000 --> 28:28.000]  on that particular story before but the issue here
[28:28.000 --> 28:31.000]  we did with Jeffrey Smith about a month ago
[28:31.000 --> 28:36.000]  the issue here is that they have tested all of this out
[28:36.000 --> 28:40.000]  new arsenic nanoparticle blocks aggressive breast cancer
[28:40.000 --> 28:45.000]  no that's an article about them saying arsenic is good
[28:45.000 --> 28:48.000]  in some ways of course poisons do
[28:48.000 --> 28:51.000]  in small amounts knock out cancers that are delivered right
[28:51.000 --> 28:55.000]  they also kill the other tissues and attack DNA and cells
[28:55.000 --> 28:59.000]  the point is is that if you research history
[28:59.000 --> 29:01.000]  um
[29:04.000 --> 29:06.000]  search engine this term
[29:06.000 --> 29:08.000]  this should pull it up
[29:08.000 --> 29:12.000]  arsenic addiction in Elizabethan England
[29:12.000 --> 29:16.000]  that should bring it up for you
[29:16.000 --> 29:20.000]  or arsenic addiction in 18th and 19th century England
[29:20.000 --> 29:22.000]  it was epidemic
[29:22.000 --> 29:26.000]  they didn't have a cup of tea they had a pinch of arsenic
[29:26.000 --> 29:29.000]  okay we're going to come back into other issues
[29:29.000 --> 29:33.000]  and take your phone calls 1-800-259-9231
[29:33.000 --> 29:37.000]  1-800-259-9231
[29:37.000 --> 29:40.000]  is the toll free number to join us on this Friday
[29:40.000 --> 29:42.000]  we're going to cover the economy
[29:42.000 --> 29:44.000]  the oil cap which we praise the truth
[29:44.000 --> 29:46.000]  they claim they fixed it
[29:46.000 --> 29:49.000]  what's happening on the financial end it's all coming up
[29:50.000 --> 29:52.000]  we're on the march
[29:52.000 --> 29:54.000]  the empire's on the run
[29:54.000 --> 29:57.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN radio network

[33:14.000 --> 33:20.000]  front porch sitting in an old rockin' chair
[33:20.000 --> 33:26.000]  the sun is hot in the Texas sky
[33:26.000 --> 33:32.000]  garden growing, clothes out on a line
[33:32.000 --> 33:35.000]  a dusty road when a car goes by
[33:35.000 --> 33:37.000]  let's get into the economic news
[33:37.000 --> 33:39.000]  we'll cover it more when Bob joins us coming up
[33:39.000 --> 33:41.000]  at the one o'clock hour
[33:41.000 --> 33:43.000]  and we'll go to your phone calls
[33:43.000 --> 33:46.000]  a slap on the wrist for Goldman Sachs
[33:46.000 --> 33:49.000]  Goldman Sachs, of course the federal government
[33:49.000 --> 33:53.000]  literally run by former Goldman Sachs alumni
[33:53.000 --> 33:57.000]  who hold masses of Goldman Sachs stock
[33:57.000 --> 33:59.000]  as much of Congress does
[33:59.000 --> 34:02.000]  they basically did nothing to them
[34:02.000 --> 34:05.000]  and from the beginning they focused in on their investigation
[34:05.000 --> 34:07.000]  on Timberwolf
[34:07.000 --> 34:11.000]  just one little area of the scores of crimes
[34:11.000 --> 34:13.000]  committed by Goldman Sachs
[34:13.000 --> 34:17.000]  and of course those emails admitted that they were selling
[34:17.000 --> 34:21.000]  people mortgage derivatives
[34:21.000 --> 34:23.000]  when they knew they were pure crud
[34:23.000 --> 34:25.000]  and when they were basically betting against them
[34:25.000 --> 34:26.000]  and put options
[34:26.000 --> 34:28.000]  it may have been a record-defined
[34:28.000 --> 34:29.000]  for a financial institution
[34:29.000 --> 34:32.000]  but it appears investment bank Goldman Sachs got off lightly
[34:32.000 --> 34:34.000]  the whole affair brings into question
[34:34.000 --> 34:37.000]  the strength of the securities and exchange commission case
[34:37.000 --> 34:40.000]  the great vampire squad
[34:40.000 --> 34:42.000]  wrapped about the face of humanity
[34:42.000 --> 34:46.000]  agreed to pay $550 million
[34:46.000 --> 34:48.000]  hundreds and hundreds of billions
[34:48.000 --> 34:52.000]  to settle fraud charges
[34:52.000 --> 34:54.000]  but crucially it did not admit guilt
[34:54.000 --> 34:58.000]  for misleading clients over subprime mortgage products
[34:58.000 --> 35:01.000]  so nothing done to them
[35:01.000 --> 35:04.000]  even the FCC appears to have decided no fraud was committed
[35:04.000 --> 35:06.000]  and accepts that Goldman made a mistake
[35:06.000 --> 35:07.000]  in its marketing material
[35:07.000 --> 35:11.000]  even though they said this is pure bleeping
[35:11.000 --> 35:14.000]  remember the cuss word that the senator was using in the hearings
[35:14.000 --> 35:17.000]  pure bleeping that they sold the public
[35:17.000 --> 35:20.000]  it failed to hold Goldman's feet to the fire
[35:20.000 --> 35:23.000]  even if no one can question the size of the fine
[35:23.000 --> 35:26.000]  and in the new financial re-regulation package
[35:26.000 --> 35:28.000]  that literally gives the fellow reserve
[35:28.000 --> 35:31.000]  total control over the economy with no congressional oversight
[35:31.000 --> 35:33.000]  that's in the bill that the House and Senate have passed
[35:33.000 --> 35:35.000]  that Obama will now sign
[35:35.000 --> 35:40.000]  they've done it
[35:40.000 --> 35:42.000]  they don't even look at derivatives
[35:42.000 --> 35:45.000]  and restricting them until 2022
[35:45.000 --> 35:49.000]  or 12 years from now
[35:49.000 --> 35:52.000]  and when you read the Wall Street Journal and other reports
[35:52.000 --> 35:55.000]  they'll admit well it is a private fellow reserve board
[35:55.000 --> 35:58.000]  made up of banking heads of the elite banks
[35:58.000 --> 36:00.000]  and different banking associations at the state level
[36:00.000 --> 36:02.000]  like the Texas Banking Association
[36:02.000 --> 36:03.000]  says it's a total takeover
[36:03.000 --> 36:06.000]  and will be used to shut down local healthy banks
[36:06.000 --> 36:07.000]  that weren't involved in derivatives
[36:07.000 --> 36:09.000]  the public is being sold this is reform
[36:09.000 --> 36:11.000]  and I've seen emails and comments saying
[36:11.000 --> 36:14.000]  Alex why are you against reform?
[36:14.000 --> 36:16.000]  reform would be abolishing the fellow reserve
[36:16.000 --> 36:18.000]  or at least auditing it
[36:18.000 --> 36:20.000]  reform would be banning derivatives
[36:20.000 --> 36:22.000]  that are counterfeit fraudulent instruments
[36:22.000 --> 36:24.000]  that have bankrupted our society by design
[36:24.000 --> 36:27.000]  reform would not be bailing out
[36:27.000 --> 36:29.000]  these criminal institutions
[36:29.000 --> 36:32.000]  and it's not just my analysis of the bill
[36:32.000 --> 36:34.000]  Judge Andrew Napolitano has agreed
[36:34.000 --> 36:35.000]  Ron Paul has agreed
[36:35.000 --> 36:36.000]  but Ron Paul was on two weeks ago
[36:36.000 --> 36:38.000]  and he said you are exactly right in your analysis
[36:38.000 --> 36:40.000]  when I said what I just said
[36:40.000 --> 36:43.000]  that it's a coup d'etat by the bankers
[36:43.000 --> 36:46.000]  they took over the issuance of currency and credit in 1913
[36:46.000 --> 36:48.000]  97 years ago
[36:48.000 --> 36:50.000]  and now they're setting up a total dictatorship
[36:50.000 --> 36:51.000]  over the entire economy
[36:51.000 --> 36:53.000]  anything that affects the economy
[36:53.000 --> 36:55.000]  they have the power outside the Congress
[36:55.000 --> 36:57.000]  this is much worse than in 1995
[36:57.000 --> 37:00.000]  when the Congress handed over almost all of its trade authority
[37:00.000 --> 37:03.000]  via fast track to the World Trade Organization
[37:03.000 --> 37:05.000]  itself a private board
[37:05.000 --> 37:08.000]  and when you read the security and prosperity partnership documents
[37:08.000 --> 37:10.000]  and the North Atlantic Alliance Agreement
[37:10.000 --> 37:16.000]  signed by Bush, Merkel, and Barroso in 2007
[37:16.000 --> 37:19.000]  it all states that private corporate boards
[37:19.000 --> 37:21.000]  file reports and the government implements it
[37:21.000 --> 37:26.000]  through the bureaucracy
[37:26.000 --> 37:28.000]  but when you read the headline
[37:28.000 --> 37:29.000]  in the Wall Street Journal
[37:29.000 --> 37:32.000]  lawmakers are very pleased
[37:32.000 --> 37:35.000]  law remakes U.S. financial landscape
[37:35.000 --> 37:37.000]  Senate passes overhaul
[37:37.000 --> 37:39.000]  that will touch most Americans
[37:39.000 --> 37:41.000]  bankers
[37:41.000 --> 37:43.000]  gird for a fight over fine print
[37:46.000 --> 37:49.000]  well it's written so the big mega six banks
[37:49.000 --> 37:51.000]  have run the regulatory arm
[37:51.000 --> 37:53.000]  the private federal reserve has been given
[37:53.000 --> 37:55.000]  dictatorial power it's totally illegitimate
[37:55.000 --> 37:57.000]  and we have to fight it and expose it
[37:57.000 --> 37:59.000]  and the good news is
[37:59.000 --> 38:01.000]  that ABC News is reporting Senator Shelby
[38:01.000 --> 38:02.000]  on financial reform
[38:02.000 --> 38:04.000]  he's saying repeal the whole thing
[38:04.000 --> 38:06.000]  but I've seen the Republican leadership
[38:06.000 --> 38:08.000]  they've not been attacking it
[38:08.000 --> 38:10.000]  from the popper perspective
[38:10.000 --> 38:12.000]  they're saying it's wrong to have
[38:12.000 --> 38:14.000]  government regulation over Wall Street
[38:14.000 --> 38:16.000]  this is selective government regulation
[38:16.000 --> 38:18.000]  by Wall Street over the government
[38:18.000 --> 38:20.000]  and the population
[38:20.000 --> 38:22.000]  remember that Washington Post article
[38:22.000 --> 38:24.000]  two weeks ago I kept reading the quotes from it
[38:24.000 --> 38:26.000]  because it was so honest in the information
[38:26.000 --> 38:28.000]  but not in their conclusion
[38:28.000 --> 38:30.000]  their conclusion was we need this
[38:32.000 --> 38:34.000]  and it's a good thing but it said it gives
[38:34.000 --> 38:36.000]  near total autonomy
[38:36.000 --> 38:38.000]  and power to a private
[38:38.000 --> 38:40.000]  secretive non-reviewable
[38:40.000 --> 38:42.000]  board run by the Federal Reserve
[38:42.000 --> 38:44.000]  made up by the heads of the top banks
[38:44.000 --> 38:46.000]  and brokerage firms
[38:46.000 --> 38:48.000]  and it will quote deal with winding down
[38:48.000 --> 38:50.000]  the 600 trillion
[38:50.000 --> 38:52.000]  dollars in derivatives
[38:52.000 --> 38:54.000]  that's a conservative number
[38:56.000 --> 38:58.000]  the entire GDP is 14 trillion
[38:58.000 --> 39:00.000]  dollars a year
[39:00.000 --> 39:02.000]  the average American already
[39:02.000 --> 39:04.000]  owes over 200,000
[39:04.000 --> 39:06.000]  dollars for the bailout
[39:06.000 --> 39:08.000]  and government expenditures and commitments
[39:08.000 --> 39:10.000]  and that's a conservative number as well
[39:12.000 --> 39:14.000]  President Obama took on House
[39:14.000 --> 39:16.000]  GOP leader John Bainer's
[39:16.000 --> 39:18.000]  call for repealing the financial reform
[39:18.000 --> 39:20.000]  bill before it signed yesterday
[39:23.000 --> 39:25.000]  but Bonner's call was backed by the
[39:25.000 --> 39:27.000]  GMA and Richard Shelby the ranking Republican
[39:27.000 --> 39:29.000]  on the Senate Banking Committee
[39:29.000 --> 39:32.000]  we would like to repeal it
[39:32.000 --> 39:34.000]  we have empowered a lot of regulatory bodies
[39:34.000 --> 39:36.000]  that failed us before and the question is
[39:36.000 --> 39:38.000]  what have we learned?
[39:38.000 --> 39:40.000]  he said it's going
[39:40.000 --> 39:42.000]  and it's not going to create jobs
[39:42.000 --> 39:44.000]  which we desperately need, it's going to cut jobs
[39:44.000 --> 39:46.000]  it's going to hurt the economy
[39:46.000 --> 39:48.000]  in there every debit card
[39:48.000 --> 39:50.000]  transaction, every sale you make
[39:50.000 --> 39:52.000]  everything you do
[39:52.000 --> 39:54.000]  what was in the last stimulus package?
[39:54.000 --> 39:56.000]  50-something billion dollars
[39:56.000 --> 39:58.000]  to pay GM to move to Brazil
[39:58.000 --> 40:00.000]  Eastern Europe and China
[40:00.000 --> 40:02.000]  billions of the money
[40:02.000 --> 40:04.000]  and that's mainstream headlines
[40:04.000 --> 40:06.000]  GM bailout money
[40:06.000 --> 40:08.000]  used to move plant to Brazil
[40:08.000 --> 40:10.000]  search that headline
[40:12.000 --> 40:14.000]  here's just one of the things
[40:14.000 --> 40:16.000]  that was in the stimulus and this new one
[40:16.000 --> 40:18.000]  is just riddled with this stuff as well
[40:18.000 --> 40:20.000]  obesity rating for every American
[40:20.000 --> 40:22.000]  must be included in stimulus
[40:22.000 --> 40:24.000]  mandated electronic health records
[40:24.000 --> 40:26.000]  says health and human services
[40:26.000 --> 40:28.000]  cyber news service
[40:28.000 --> 40:30.000]  tracking how much you weigh
[40:30.000 --> 40:32.000]  they're already doing that through the schools
[40:32.000 --> 40:34.000]  to then tax you if you're overweight
[40:34.000 --> 40:36.000]  they admit they're now going to do that
[40:36.000 --> 40:38.000]  and say what you can put in a child's happy meal
[40:38.000 --> 40:40.000]  oh it's okay for McDonald's to put
[40:40.000 --> 40:42.000]  silicone in the food
[40:42.000 --> 40:44.000]  that's CNN
[40:44.000 --> 40:46.000]  a petrochemical, extremely poisonous
[40:48.000 --> 40:50.000]  illegal in England
[40:50.000 --> 40:52.000]  in other countries
[40:52.000 --> 40:54.000]  but you can't put a toy in there
[40:54.000 --> 40:56.000]  see it's all about control
[41:00.000 --> 41:02.000]  congress acts but
[41:02.000 --> 41:04.000]  bank bill has work ahead
[41:04.000 --> 41:06.000]  is what AP says oh yes
[41:06.000 --> 41:08.000]  don't expect things to get better now that they've done this
[41:08.000 --> 41:10.000]  no it's going to get worse
[41:10.000 --> 41:12.000]  China reduces US
[41:12.000 --> 41:14.000]  treasury debt
[41:14.000 --> 41:16.000]  holdings in the month of May
[41:16.000 --> 41:18.000]  we always find out
[41:18.000 --> 41:20.000]  later what they've done
[41:20.000 --> 41:22.000]  China reduces holdings in US treasury debt in May
[41:22.000 --> 41:24.000]  as a total foreign holdings
[41:24.000 --> 41:26.000]  of government debt posted a slight increase
[41:26.000 --> 41:28.000]  and
[41:28.000 --> 41:30.000]  they've openly announced that they're downgrading
[41:30.000 --> 41:32.000]  US treasury bonds
[41:32.000 --> 41:34.000]  debt that they're buying
[41:34.000 --> 41:36.000]  from the bankers and that they're moving
[41:36.000 --> 41:38.000]  to the SDRs
[41:40.000 --> 41:42.000]  see now that we've had globalism and did naturalization
[41:42.000 --> 41:44.000]  we still have the dollars
[41:44.000 --> 41:46.000]  we could buy all the precious Chinese slave goods
[41:46.000 --> 41:48.000]  made by people
[41:48.000 --> 41:50.000]  living in lockdown concentration camps
[41:50.000 --> 41:52.000]  that was in the AP yesterday
[41:52.000 --> 41:54.000]  like it was no big deal
[41:54.000 --> 41:56.000]  yes everybody's locked up at night in these worker neighborhoods
[41:56.000 --> 41:58.000]  and not allowed to come out
[41:58.000 --> 42:00.000]  but if they come out
[42:00.000 --> 42:02.000]  they're sent to a reeducation center
[42:02.000 --> 42:04.000]  but that's how you have law and order
[42:04.000 --> 42:06.000]  that's right out of the running man
[42:06.000 --> 42:08.000]  when they're running around to the city
[42:08.000 --> 42:10.000]  and you see the big billboard telescreen saying
[42:10.000 --> 42:16.000]  $1.00 caught out after dark will be permanently detained
[42:16.000 --> 42:18.000]  $1.00 extends losses on
[42:18.000 --> 42:20.000]  US economy concerns
[42:20.000 --> 42:22.000]  this is out of the French news agency
[42:22.000 --> 42:24.000]  the $1.00 fell further Friday
[42:24.000 --> 42:26.000]  touching the lowest level so far for the year against the yen
[42:26.000 --> 42:28.000]  as weak US data fuel concerns
[42:28.000 --> 42:30.000]  about the world's biggest economy analysts said
[42:30.000 --> 42:32.000]  they're now announcing that we're going to implode
[42:32.000 --> 42:34.000]  now we know the global's
[42:34.000 --> 42:36.000]  we're engineering an implosion
[42:36.000 --> 42:38.000]  and people are now saying wow the media's being honest
[42:38.000 --> 42:40.000]  yes but they're telling you the solution
[42:40.000 --> 42:42.000]  is more power for these people
[42:42.000 --> 42:44.000]  and they're now announcing it
[42:44.000 --> 42:46.000]  to run the market down themselves
[42:46.000 --> 42:48.000]  here's another great article
[42:48.000 --> 42:50.000]  by the economic collapse upon prisonplanet.com
[42:50.000 --> 42:52.000]  will thousands of police layoffs
[42:52.000 --> 42:54.000]  unleash chaos and anarchy across America
[42:54.000 --> 42:56.000]  gee in Ohio
[42:56.000 --> 42:58.000]  in California
[42:58.000 --> 43:00.000]  in Michigan and Florida and New York
[43:00.000 --> 43:02.000]  Illinois I'm seeing the reports
[43:02.000 --> 43:04.000]  the government coming out and saying
[43:04.000 --> 43:06.000]  we won't respond to normal crime
[43:06.000 --> 43:08.000]  robberies people being poisoned
[43:08.000 --> 43:10.000]  by design
[43:10.000 --> 43:12.000]  people sabotaging power poles
[43:12.000 --> 43:14.000]  robbing cars
[43:14.000 --> 43:16.000]  we're not going to respond to identity theft
[43:16.000 --> 43:18.000]  embezzlement extortion
[43:18.000 --> 43:20.000]  gee what do you think criminals are going to do
[43:20.000 --> 43:22.000]  here's a CNBC report
[43:22.000 --> 43:24.000]  consumer sentiment
[43:24.000 --> 43:26.000]  sinks to lowest level in 11 months
[43:30.000 --> 43:32.000]  here's another one from before it's news
[43:32.000 --> 43:34.000]  upcoming false flag
[43:34.000 --> 43:36.000]  politicians placed on energy companies
[43:36.000 --> 43:38.000]  just as three days before 9-11
[43:38.000 --> 43:40.000]  there was an unusual amount of trading going on
[43:40.000 --> 43:42.000]  with American Airlines
[43:42.000 --> 43:44.000]  we are seeing the same type
[43:44.000 --> 43:46.000]  of action this time with power companies
[43:46.000 --> 43:48.000]  this is Obama supporters
[43:48.000 --> 43:50.000]  saying act of terrorism is the only thing
[43:50.000 --> 43:52.000]  that will save them
[43:52.000 --> 43:54.000]  and then the market watch report
[43:54.000 --> 43:56.000]  which is a division
[43:56.000 --> 43:58.000]  of news corps
[43:58.000 --> 44:00.000]  says unusual volume of
[44:00.000 --> 44:02.000]  put contracts was traded today
[44:02.000 --> 44:04.000]  there were 713 put contracts
[44:04.000 --> 44:06.000]  versus the 10 day average
[44:06.000 --> 44:08.000]  of 55 on the call side
[44:08.000 --> 44:10.000]  27 call contracts were traded
[44:10.000 --> 44:12.000]  today's trade put call ratio
[44:12.000 --> 44:14.000]  at 26.41
[44:14.000 --> 44:16.000]  there were 26.41
[44:16.000 --> 44:18.000]  puts traded for each
[44:18.000 --> 44:20.000]  call contract on power companies
[44:20.000 --> 44:22.000]  so we'll continue to watch
[44:22.000 --> 44:24.000]  that
[44:28.000 --> 44:30.000]  so that is just
[44:30.000 --> 44:32.000]  some
[44:32.000 --> 44:34.000]  of the economic news
[44:34.000 --> 44:36.000]  there's another report
[44:36.000 --> 44:38.000]  from the dollar vigilante that says
[44:38.000 --> 44:40.000]  how and why the world financial
[44:40.000 --> 44:42.000]  system has to collapse
[44:46.000 --> 44:48.000]  well it
[44:48.000 --> 44:50.000]  has to collapse because it's designed
[44:50.000 --> 44:52.000]  to collapse they've created
[44:52.000 --> 44:54.000]  thousands of times
[44:54.000 --> 44:56.000]  more counterfeit derivatives
[44:56.000 --> 44:58.000]  and financial fraud
[44:58.000 --> 45:00.000]  instruments than there is
[45:00.000 --> 45:02.000]  real assets in the world
[45:02.000 --> 45:04.000]  even if you inflated assets
[45:04.000 --> 45:06.000]  thousands of times
[45:08.000 --> 45:10.000]  in their value artificially
[45:10.000 --> 45:12.000]  it wouldn't meet the derivatives
[45:12.000 --> 45:14.000]  this is a financial weapon
[45:14.000 --> 45:16.000]  this is a black hole
[45:16.000 --> 45:18.000]  it's designed to
[45:18.000 --> 45:20.000]  render you down to a
[45:20.000 --> 45:22.000]  bankrupt surf
[45:24.000 --> 45:26.000]  and Webster Tarpley has an excellent report
[45:26.000 --> 45:28.000]  on this up at infowars.com
[45:28.000 --> 45:30.000]  Obama Dodd Frank
[45:36.000 --> 45:38.000]  are now
[45:38.000 --> 45:40.000]  protecting the derivatives curb
[45:40.000 --> 45:42.000]  out until
[45:42.000 --> 45:44.000]  2022
[45:44.000 --> 45:46.000]  and that's in the financial
[45:46.000 --> 45:48.000]  reform bill
[45:48.000 --> 45:50.000]  and see they've changed semantics
[45:50.000 --> 45:52.000]  to where the average person thinks
[45:52.000 --> 45:54.000]  when they hear the term overhaul
[45:54.000 --> 45:56.000]  or reform
[45:56.000 --> 45:58.000]  that it means it's something good
[45:58.000 --> 46:00.000]  but if Titus
[46:00.000 --> 46:02.000]  in 70
[46:02.000 --> 46:04.000]  AD
[46:04.000 --> 46:06.000]  sacked Jerusalem
[46:06.000 --> 46:08.000]  and overturned
[46:08.000 --> 46:10.000]  every structure
[46:10.000 --> 46:12.000]  and didn't leave one stone standing on another
[46:12.000 --> 46:14.000]  not one brick sitting on another
[46:16.000 --> 46:18.000]  just as Christ pointed to the Pharisees
[46:18.000 --> 46:20.000]  and said within your lifetime
[46:20.000 --> 46:22.000]  not a single one of these stones
[46:22.000 --> 46:24.000]  will be standing on top of another
[46:24.000 --> 46:26.000]  and that temple will be destroyed
[46:26.000 --> 46:28.000]  the point is
[46:28.000 --> 46:30.000]  should Titus
[46:30.000 --> 46:32.000]  have called the destruction of Jerusalem
[46:32.000 --> 46:34.000]  an overhaul
[46:36.000 --> 46:38.000]  a reform
[46:38.000 --> 46:40.000]  and I've said it before if you run out into
[46:40.000 --> 46:42.000]  I-35 traffic
[46:42.000 --> 46:44.000]  at say high noon when traffic's flowing
[46:44.000 --> 46:46.000]  at 80 miles an hour
[46:46.000 --> 46:48.000]  and you see an 18-wheeler coming down the road
[46:48.000 --> 46:50.000]  it's 30 yards away and you jump out in front of the 18-wheeler
[46:50.000 --> 46:52.000]  and at 80 miles an hour it hits you
[46:52.000 --> 46:54.000]  there's almost 100% chance you're going to die
[46:54.000 --> 46:56.000]  and your body is going to be smashed
[46:56.000 --> 46:58.000]  and run over
[46:58.000 --> 47:00.000]  and look like sloppy joes
[47:00.000 --> 47:02.000]  for 100 yards down the road as it drags your body
[47:02.000 --> 47:04.000]  your body is going to be in parts
[47:04.000 --> 47:06.000]  your guts are going to be smeared all over the road
[47:06.000 --> 47:08.000]  now that is a reform
[47:10.000 --> 47:12.000]  if I take a sculpture
[47:12.000 --> 47:14.000]  of clay a beautiful sculpture
[47:14.000 --> 47:16.000]  of say a falcon
[47:16.000 --> 47:18.000]  and I take a rubber
[47:18.000 --> 47:20.000]  mallet hammer to it
[47:20.000 --> 47:22.000]  and bash it into a flat pancake
[47:22.000 --> 47:24.000]  that is a reform
[47:24.000 --> 47:26.000]  if you take your arm
[47:26.000 --> 47:28.000]  and stick it in a blender an industrial blender on high
[47:28.000 --> 47:30.000]  and chop it off to your wrist
[47:30.000 --> 47:32.000]  and hold your arm up with red blood
[47:32.000 --> 47:34.000]  gouting and founting
[47:34.000 --> 47:36.000]  and spraying out
[47:36.000 --> 47:38.000]  that is a reform your hand has been reformed
[47:38.000 --> 47:40.000]  it is in the blender
[47:40.000 --> 47:42.000]  in pieces
[47:42.000 --> 47:44.000]  when I took that iPad
[47:44.000 --> 47:46.000]  to illustrate that people only care about machines
[47:46.000 --> 47:48.000]  and not fellow humans
[47:48.000 --> 47:50.000]  because we've been dehumanized and desensitized
[47:50.000 --> 47:52.000]  and I took a power drill to it and then a hammer
[47:52.000 --> 47:54.000]  I reformed it
[47:54.000 --> 47:56.000]  so yes they're reforming the international
[47:56.000 --> 47:58.000]  system they're reforming
[47:58.000 --> 48:00.000]  the dollar they're reforming the family
[48:00.000 --> 48:02.000]  they're reforming our trade
[48:02.000 --> 48:04.000]  and our industry and our society
[48:04.000 --> 48:06.000]  and yes green jobs
[48:06.000 --> 48:08.000]  and carbon taxes in its own
[48:08.000 --> 48:10.000]  statements from the UN club of Rome
[48:10.000 --> 48:12.000]  council on foreign relations
[48:12.000 --> 48:14.000]  royal commission all state
[48:14.000 --> 48:16.000]  states are trying to
[48:16.000 --> 48:18.000]  bring you down to the level of
[48:18.000 --> 48:20.000]  bankrupt slaves
[48:20.000 --> 48:22.000]  110%
[48:22.000 --> 48:24.000]  these people
[48:24.000 --> 48:26.000]  want to wreck things they want to make you dependent
[48:26.000 --> 48:28.000]  they want to conquer you
[48:28.000 --> 48:30.000]  your genetic code
[48:30.000 --> 48:32.000]  is being reformed by all the poisons
[48:32.000 --> 48:34.000]  and toxins
[48:34.000 --> 48:36.000]  just search the term
[48:38.000 --> 48:40.000]  gene damage
[48:40.000 --> 48:42.000]  or human DNA damage
[48:42.000 --> 48:44.000]  exponentially because they can study the births
[48:44.000 --> 48:46.000]  in real time
[48:46.000 --> 48:48.000]  and these western nations
[48:48.000 --> 48:50.000]  everywhere where you eat GMO food
[48:50.000 --> 48:52.000]  everywhere where you eat food with all these preservatives
[48:52.000 --> 48:54.000]  they aren't just bad for you
[48:54.000 --> 48:56.000]  what is bad for you mean it means deadly
[48:56.000 --> 48:58.000]  it means harmful
[49:02.000 --> 49:04.000]  you know what mercury does to your DNA
[49:04.000 --> 49:06.000]  Rob Dude brought me a mainstream news article today
[49:06.000 --> 49:08.000]  I mean I knew that
[49:08.000 --> 49:10.000]  Washington Post
[49:10.000 --> 49:12.000]  reported years ago
[49:12.000 --> 49:14.000]  that half of soft drinks have high levels of
[49:14.000 --> 49:16.000]  mercury in them
[49:16.000 --> 49:18.000]  I knew that most of the
[49:18.000 --> 49:20.000]  crops we eat are full of mercury
[49:20.000 --> 49:22.000]  but he brought one in about how
[49:22.000 --> 49:24.000]  children's fruit bowls
[49:24.000 --> 49:26.000]  those pre-prepared fruit bowls
[49:26.000 --> 49:28.000]  and fruit juices are filled
[49:28.000 --> 49:30.000]  with levels of mercury that are off the charts
[49:30.000 --> 49:32.000]  I mean you might as well go eat
[49:32.000 --> 49:38.000]  stored fish every day it'd be better for you
[49:38.000 --> 49:40.000]  there's mercury
[49:40.000 --> 49:42.000]  there's lead
[49:42.000 --> 49:44.000]  it's in the crops it's in the food
[49:44.000 --> 49:46.000]  it's in everything
[49:46.000 --> 49:48.000]  you can search lead in children's foods
[49:48.000 --> 49:50.000]  mercury in children's foods
[49:50.000 --> 49:52.000]  but if there's a much lower level
[49:52.000 --> 49:54.000]  in a children's toy they'll have a big
[49:54.000 --> 49:56.000]  recall everyone will gather
[49:56.000 --> 49:58.000]  around and get scared and the government
[49:58.000 --> 50:00.000]  will have billboards up warning you
[50:00.000 --> 50:02.000]  about how they care about you
[50:02.000 --> 50:04.000]  they'll always focus on some little bitty thing
[50:04.000 --> 50:06.000]  that isn't really a problem
[50:06.000 --> 50:08.000]  comparatively
[50:08.000 --> 50:10.000]  and then ignore the giant
[50:10.000 --> 50:12.000]  problems
[50:12.000 --> 50:14.000]  but there's lead, mercury, arsenic
[50:14.000 --> 50:16.000]  it's all in there because do you know
[50:16.000 --> 50:18.000]  what they do with the distillates
[50:18.000 --> 50:20.000]  from oil production
[50:20.000 --> 50:22.000]  all the things they can't use
[50:22.000 --> 50:24.000]  they mix it with fertilizer
[50:24.000 --> 50:26.000]  hundreds of chemicals
[50:26.000 --> 50:28.000]  and they
[50:28.000 --> 50:30.000]  then spray it as fertilizer
[50:30.000 --> 50:32.000]  onto the crops
[50:32.000 --> 50:34.000]  and plants
[50:34.000 --> 50:36.000]  are very good in fact they use
[50:36.000 --> 50:38.000]  corn to detoxify land
[50:38.000 --> 50:40.000]  that had problems
[50:40.000 --> 50:42.000]  they will suck it up
[50:42.000 --> 50:44.000]  and then you eat it
[50:46.000 --> 50:48.000]  they will suck it up
[50:48.000 --> 50:50.000]  and you eat it
[50:50.000 --> 50:52.000]  now does LeBron James
[50:52.000 --> 50:54.000]  and Lindsay Lohan

[53:00.000 --> 53:02.000]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons
[53:02.000 --> 53:04.000]  you should consider buying a solar power generator
[53:04.000 --> 53:06.000]  number one
[53:06.000 --> 53:08.000]  new climate legislation could easily double or triple
[53:08.000 --> 53:10.000]  your electric bill
[53:10.000 --> 53:12.000]  number two, our new energies are
[53:12.000 --> 53:14.000]  wants to control how much power your electric company
[53:14.000 --> 53:16.000]  allows you to have
[53:16.000 --> 53:18.000]  it's true, total government control of electricity
[53:18.000 --> 53:20.000]  in the name of smart grid technology
[53:20.000 --> 53:22.000]  is coming
[53:22.000 --> 53:24.000]  number three, in some areas of the country
[53:24.000 --> 53:26.000]  the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[53:26.000 --> 53:28.000]  and now a new socialist legislation
[53:28.000 --> 53:30.000]  is only compounding the problem
[53:30.000 --> 53:32.000]  number four, dangerous weather is always a threat
[53:32.000 --> 53:34.000]  to local grids
[53:34.000 --> 53:36.000]  every year thousands of families lose their power
[53:36.000 --> 53:38.000]  from weather related onages
[53:38.000 --> 53:40.000]  number five, a solar power generator provides
[53:40.000 --> 53:42.000]  powerful backup insurance and peace of mind
[53:42.000 --> 53:44.000]  folks I really believe in the solar power generators
[53:44.000 --> 53:46.000]  offered by solutions from science
[53:46.000 --> 53:48.000]  one of my old sponsors
[53:48.000 --> 53:50.000]  www.mysolarbackup.com
[53:50.000 --> 53:52.000]  that's mysolarbackup.com

[53:54.000 --> 53:56.000]  so go to mysolarbackup.com
[53:56.000 --> 54:00.000]  or call 1-877-327-0365
[54:00.000 --> 54:02.000]  music
[54:02.000 --> 54:04.000]  music
[54:04.000 --> 54:06.000]  music
[54:26.000 --> 54:28.000]  and the sun is going to burn into a cinder
[54:28.000 --> 54:30.000]  the sun is going to burn into a cinder
[54:32.000 --> 54:34.000]  before we ever pass this way again
[54:38.000 --> 54:40.000]  and we're going to rise
[54:40.000 --> 54:42.000]  music
[54:56.000 --> 54:58.000]  okay, we're going to start the second hour
[55:00.000 --> 55:02.000]  and I'm going to go to Tim, TJ, Eddie
[55:02.000 --> 55:04.000]  Tim, Ronnie and others
[55:04.000 --> 55:10.000]  the toll-tree number to join us is 1-800-259-9231
[55:10.000 --> 55:12.000]  Bob Chapman's coming up
[55:12.000 --> 55:14.000]  in the third hour today to talk about the economy
[55:14.000 --> 55:16.000]  coming up
[55:16.000 --> 55:18.000]  also BP says they've stopped the oil leak
[55:18.000 --> 55:20.000]  in the Gulf of Mexico
[55:20.000 --> 55:22.000]  but we've got screenshots
[55:22.000 --> 55:24.000]  of their cameras down there
[55:24.000 --> 55:26.000]  and it
[55:26.000 --> 55:28.000]  looks like there may be some
[55:28.000 --> 55:30.000]  hanky-panky going on
[55:30.000 --> 55:32.000]  but we are looking into it right now
[55:32.000 --> 55:34.000]  and we're working on that
[55:34.000 --> 55:36.000]  but if this is true, praise God
[55:36.000 --> 55:38.000]  this is certainly wonderful news
[55:38.000 --> 55:40.000]  but we'll be talking about that
[55:40.000 --> 55:42.000]  and discussing it
[55:42.000 --> 55:44.000]  coming up after we go through a bunch of your phone calls
[55:44.000 --> 55:46.000]  also the
[55:46.000 --> 55:48.000]  head of the United Arab Emirates
[55:48.000 --> 55:50.000]  their ambassador says
[55:50.000 --> 55:52.000]  country, Maybach, a US-Israeli attack
[55:52.000 --> 55:54.000]  on Iran
[55:54.000 --> 55:56.000]  this is very serious news
[55:56.000 --> 55:58.000]  out of Der Spiegel
[55:58.000 --> 56:00.000]  and also the Saudi Arabian newspapers
[56:00.000 --> 56:02.000]  and Business Insider
[56:02.000 --> 56:04.000]  so we're going to be breaking that down
[56:04.000 --> 56:06.000]  coming up
[56:06.000 --> 56:08.000]  another economic report here from Yahoo Finance
[56:08.000 --> 56:10.000]  the US middle class is being wiped out
[56:10.000 --> 56:12.000]  here's the stats to prove it
[56:12.000 --> 56:14.000]  and
[56:14.000 --> 56:16.000]  we'll also then get into
[56:16.000 --> 56:18.000]  Kagan, there may be a filibuster of her
[56:18.000 --> 56:20.000]  if Senator Jeff Sessions decides
[56:20.000 --> 56:22.000]  to take action
[56:22.000 --> 56:24.000]  we need to put pressure on Senator Sessions
[56:24.000 --> 56:26.000]  who's done some pretty good work in the past
[56:26.000 --> 56:28.000]  one of the better senators up there
[56:28.000 --> 56:30.000]  look, you have a duty to filibuster this monster
[56:30.000 --> 56:32.000]  who's anti free speech
[56:32.000 --> 56:34.000]  and Second Amendment and private property
[56:34.000 --> 56:36.000]  and anti-family
[56:36.000 --> 56:38.000]  it doesn't matter if she still gets confirmed
[56:38.000 --> 56:40.000]  you have a responsibility to expose her
[56:40.000 --> 56:42.000]  as the monster she is
[56:42.000 --> 56:44.000]  so there's more pressure on her once she's a Supreme Court Justice
[56:44.000 --> 56:46.000]  to not double back
[56:46.000 --> 56:48.000]  and she did engage
[56:48.000 --> 56:50.000]  in
[56:50.000 --> 56:52.000]  perjury before
[56:52.000 --> 56:54.000]  another congressional hearing
[56:54.000 --> 56:56.000]  when she was confirmed as Solicitor General
[56:56.000 --> 56:58.000]  and she got in
[56:58.000 --> 57:00.000]  was double back on what she promised
[57:00.000 --> 57:02.000]  so this woman is unfit to be a toilet attendant
[57:02.000 --> 57:04.000]  but
[57:04.000 --> 57:06.000]  that's coming up, your phone calls
[57:06.000 --> 57:08.000]  when we start the next hour
[57:08.000 --> 57:10.000]  don't forget, all of this is possible because of your support
[57:10.000 --> 57:12.000]  when you buy the books, the videos
[57:12.000 --> 57:14.000]  the t-shirts
[57:14.000 --> 57:16.000]  all the ball caps, the materials
[57:16.000 --> 57:18.000]  and the videos, the books, the ball caps and all of it
[57:18.000 --> 57:20.000]  gets the word out
[57:20.000 --> 57:22.000]  and educates you to a higher level
[57:22.000 --> 57:24.000]  so you can wake others up
[57:24.000 --> 57:26.000]  with copies of all my films
[57:26.000 --> 57:28.000]  we carry a lot of other great books and videos
[57:28.000 --> 57:30.000]  and they're all posted of course at prisonplanet.tv
[57:30.000 --> 57:32.000]  for members there as well
[57:32.000 --> 57:34.000]  but don't forget the online video bookstore shopping cart
[57:34.000 --> 57:36.000]  we couldn't do any of this without umfullwars.com
[57:36.000 --> 57:38.000]  and lastly I want to tell you
[57:38.000 --> 57:40.000]  about
[57:40.000 --> 57:42.000]  inner food, botanicals
[57:42.000 --> 57:44.000]  we live in a toxic environment
[57:44.000 --> 57:46.000]  daily we are bombarded with chemtrails
[57:46.000 --> 57:48.000]  fluorides, pesticides and other
[57:48.000 --> 57:50.000]  equally toxic chemicals
[57:50.000 --> 57:52.000]  the folks on the Gulf Coast now
[57:52.000 --> 57:54.000]  it's important to get a super food
[57:54.000 --> 57:56.000]  20 super foods
[57:56.000 --> 57:58.000]  where your body absorbs it
[57:58.000 --> 58:00.000]  I use it, my wife uses it
[58:00.000 --> 58:02.000]  inner food helps build your body's defenses
[58:02.000 --> 58:04.000]  and helps it rid toxins
[58:04.000 --> 58:06.000]  you can try the Alex Jones combo
[58:06.000 --> 58:08.000]  with the coconut milk powder
[58:08.000 --> 58:10.000]  it's all organic
[58:10.000 --> 58:12.000]  I love the neuter cafe coffee
[58:12.000 --> 58:14.000]  but the inner food is the key
[58:14.000 --> 58:16.000]  they're super green food

[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:26.000]  was about how

[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:30.000]  and the truth
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:32.000]  basically
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000]  how much it does
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:36.000]  change your outlook on
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:38.000]  how you value your life
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:40.000]  and then
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]  i can honestly say it
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]  my life hasn't been the same
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000]  and sometimes
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]  i might even be asking for some advice
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]  here buddy but sometimes
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.000]  it's really hard
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:54.000]  to find some balance
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.000]  and to try to even maintain
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000]  a reasonable amount of
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.000]  what i got given right
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:02.000]  by the constitution
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:04.000]  that just
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:06.000]  well listen listen listen tim
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.000]  we got out of balance
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:10.000]  thomas jefferson
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:12.000]  george washington
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:14.000]  thomas pain patrick henry they all said
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:16.000]  you must guard the jewel of liberty
[01:02:16.000 --> 01:02:18.000]  you must do everything you can in its defense
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.000]  it is you know the
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:22.000]  of the prime importance even if you struggle
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:24.000]  to keep freedom you're probably going to lose it
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:26.000]  and and and you will
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:28.000]  go into bondage and the worst elements
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:30.000]  of society will take over
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000]  and so we've gotten out of balance as a society
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000]  becoming decadent fat and happy
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:36.000]  so the evil crept in
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:38.000]  now we're going back into bondage
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:40.000]  the blessings of liberty
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:42.000]  we're now losing and so
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:44.000]  what did barry goldwater say
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:46.000]  extremism and defense of liberty is no vice
[01:02:46.000 --> 01:02:48.000]  there
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:50.000]  there is no such thing as being out of balance
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:52.000]  we need the 100
[01:02:52.000 --> 01:02:54.000]  percent effort
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.000]  in waking people up in reaching out
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:58.000]  to people that doesn't mean you don't spend
[01:02:58.000 --> 01:03:00.000]  time with your family but when i'm spending
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:02.000]  time with my family out at the lake fishing
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000]  or at a local park
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000]  or on a hike and bike trail or water
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]  coloring sitting on the floor
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:10.000]  i just get closer to god
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000]  i see their innocence their beauty their goodness
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:14.000]  their wholesomeness and it just
[01:03:14.000 --> 01:03:16.000]  while and so my mind's really split
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:18.000]  while i'm thinking about them and loving them
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:20.000]  and nurturing them and loving my wife
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000]  i'm also
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:24.000]  thinking about how i've got to oppose evil
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000]  and having brainstorms
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000]  of different ways
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000]  i can warn people and
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:32.000]  what's interesting is ten years
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:34.000]  ago you know i've been married for almost
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]  nine but but you know ten years ago even six
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]  seven years ago i would still see a beautiful woman
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000]  in a grocery store and lust

[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000]  and i'm attracted to my wife but it is still
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:52.000]  my drive states

[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000]  you should consider buying a solar powered generator
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:06.000]  number one new climate legislation
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.000]  could easily double or triple your electric
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:10.000]  bill number two our new
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:12.000]  energies are wants to control how much
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000]  power your electric company allows you to have
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000]  it's true total government
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000]  control of electricity in the name
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000]  of smart grid technology is coming

[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000]  and now new socialist legislation
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000]  is only compounding the problem

[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000]  is always a threat to local grids
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:34.000]  every year thousands of families lose their
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:36.000]  power from weather related onages
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000]  number five a solar powered generator
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:40.000]  provides powerful backup insurance

[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:16.000]  from the front lines of the info war
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000]  it is Friday
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:26.000]  16th day of July
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:28.000]  2010
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:32.000]  humanity is under attack by scientific
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000]  technocracy
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000]  hell bent
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000]  on exterminating at least 80% of the world population
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000]  they're building the kill grid right now
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:42.000]  all of the mass poisoning
[01:08:42.000 --> 01:08:44.000]  and genetic engineering has only been a test
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:46.000]  the real war
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000]  is about to begin
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:50.000]  prepare yourselves

[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000]  and that doesn't mean I'm on some high horse here
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:56.000]  the reason I don't like to drink
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000]  and I like to drink as much as anybody
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000]  is because that's when I find myself
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:06.000]  lusting after other women
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:08.000]  that's when I find myself not thinking about fighting
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:10.000]  the new world order
[01:09:10.000 --> 01:09:12.000]  that's when I find myself cussing
[01:09:12.000 --> 01:09:14.000]  and allowing corrupt thoughts into my mind
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]  and not being focused
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.000]  it's the same thing when I immerse myself
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000]  in Hollywood movies
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000]  and distractions that the world puts out there
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:24.000]  none of us are perfect
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.000]  but we have to realize the better traits
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:28.000]  in humanity and reach for those
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:30.000]  instead of just giving in
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.000]  to corruption
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:34.000]  now Tim brought up something that
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000]  has really been on my heart heavily
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:38.000]  a key tool in the info war
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000]  that we have not used
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]  now in the last
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000]  decade
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000]  many times Paul Watson
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000]  and in the last
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000]  four or five years Kurt working with us
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:52.000]  and others have written blurbs
[01:09:52.000 --> 01:09:54.000]  at info wars dot com
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:56.000]  and prisonplanet dot com
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000]  when films like
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000]  in game blueprint for global enslavement
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:04.000]  or the Obama deception or the name Alex Jones
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:06.000]  gets into the top ten
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]  of google trends
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000]  or yahoo trends
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000]  and you'll see how it's a news item normally
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000]  they kind of feedback loop it and feed into it
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000]  when it's Lindsay Lohan
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000]  or when it's something like
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:20.000]  the scandal with Mel Gibson
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000]  the media hypes that oh look
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:24.000]  you know the number one trend
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000]  is
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:28.000]  Facebook
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:30.000]  or Chubacabra
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:32.000]  or Mel Gibson
[01:10:32.000 --> 01:10:34.000]  or Kelly Osborne
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:36.000]  and the BP oil spill
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000]  is way down the line
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:46.000]  unemployment extension
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.000]  in 2010
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:50.000]  is number 15
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000]  on yahoo trends
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000]  that should be number one
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000]  lead in mercury in our children's
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:11:00.000]  juice drinks
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:02.000]  and chips and food and soft drinks
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:04.000]  that's all admitted your children are drinking this
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:06.000]  in mass that should be
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000]  the top trend
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000]  now what if we
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:16.000]  gamed their corrupt system
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:18.000]  what if every listener of this show
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:20.000]  today
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000]  and tomorrow
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:24.000]  and on Sunday and Monday
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000]  typed the Obama deception
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000]  into yahoo and into google search engines
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000]  what if you did it
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:32.000]  over and over and over and over
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:34.000]  and over and over and over again
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000]  that would put the Obama deception
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:40.000]  links to the video
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:42.000]  for people to watch it for free
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000]  that would put links
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000]  to that at the top of google
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000]  and at the top of yahoo
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:50.000]  and tens of millions more
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:52.000]  would see it on top of the 25 to 30 million
[01:11:52.000 --> 01:11:54.000]  that have conservatively seen it
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000]  for free online
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000]  you can go to yahoo
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:00.000]  and see it on their video
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:02.000]  watch 5 million times, go to youtube
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000]  see it watch 6 million here
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:06.000]  2 million there, a million there
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:08.000]  500,000 here, the bit torrents listed
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.000]  it's been seen millions of times
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:12.000]  what if you all
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:14.000]  right now
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000]  went to a search engine box
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.000]  let's show people live on tv
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.000]  radio listeners can just go to google
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000]  go to yahoo, go to the biggest search engines
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000]  and type in the Obama deception
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.000]  the Obama deception
[01:12:26.000 --> 01:12:28.000]  type in the Obama deception
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000]  and this will probably work
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000]  it will probably push it into the top trends
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:34.000]  maybe even number one
[01:12:34.000 --> 01:12:36.000]  and then next week
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:38.000]  I can put out a viral video
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000]  say on genetic engineering
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:42.000]  causing DNA damage
[01:12:42.000 --> 01:12:44.000]  we can create a simple term
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:46.000]  for people to search
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:50.000]  and then millions of new people
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.000]  because of that information warfare tool
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:54.000]  we'll see it
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:56.000]  now going back 3 years ago
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:58.000]  google even admitted this
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:00.000]  that on any given day
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000]  the number one video
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000]  on google video
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:06.000]  would be one of my films
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:08.000]  a change or another patriot film
[01:13:08.000 --> 01:13:10.000]  like America freedom to fascism
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  by Aaron Russo
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  most of the time
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.000]  our videos were number one
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000]  and so because they were number one
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:20.000]  it would exponentially grow
[01:13:20.000 --> 01:13:22.000]  to some cases millions of views a day
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000]  then google made the hit counter
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.000]  secret for the public
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000]  if you had an account you could still see it
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:30.000]  we go my gosh 25 million views on endgame
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000]  but the public couldn't see it
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000]  and they just started putting up what was popular
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000]  that they made up
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:38.000]  not what was number one
[01:13:38.000 --> 01:13:40.000]  in the top slot
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:42.000]  they found out that we basically
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000]  had dominated that we had dominated the new media
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:46.000]  and we've done this we've won
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:48.000]  on the level playing field so they cheat
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000]  so before they start
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:52.000]  cheating this system
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000]  we need to game their system right now
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000]  so everyone
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000]  everyone in fact I'll do it right now
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000]  on my studio computer then I'm going back to your calls
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:02.000]  but the caller
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:04.000]  Tim in Michigan brought this up
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000]  so I'm going to
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:08.000]  go to google here
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:14.000]  google.com
[01:14:14.000 --> 01:14:16.000]  and I'm going to type
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:18.000]  the Obama deception
[01:14:18.000 --> 01:14:20.000]  the Obama
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:22.000]  deception
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.000]  in
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:26.000]  and then I'm going to click on a link
[01:14:26.000 --> 01:14:28.000]  and the first link that comes up
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:33.000]  is 6,468,347 views
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:35.000]  on the change the channel version of it
[01:14:35.000 --> 01:14:37.000]  now I'm going to back out of this channel
[01:14:37.000 --> 01:14:39.000]  I'm going to click on the second link
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:44.000]  this is a link with 830,000 views
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000]  another youtube channel
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:48.000]  and there's literally hundreds of channels that have it
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.000]  I'm going to click on a google video link
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:55.000]  I'm going to let that load
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000]  so it's important to click on the links to drive them up
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000]  but it's also important
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:05.000]  to search the term the Obama deception
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:07.000]  now why is that so important
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.000]  to search the Obama deception
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:11.000]  I made the film
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.000]  starting in
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:16.000]  November of 2009
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.000]  2008 excuse me when Obama was elected
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:21.000]  I had it basically done
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:23.000]  by the time he was inaugurated
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:25.000]  and I laid out everything he would do
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000]  how Bush works for the same people
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000]  how the banks would take over society
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000]  how the bailout was a robbery
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:33.000]  and what the globalists are doing
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:35.000]  and how the Bilderberg group selected Obama
[01:15:35.000 --> 01:15:37.000]  people need to see this to know the economic collapse
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:39.000]  is orchestrated
[01:15:39.000 --> 01:15:41.000]  and the film is evergreen
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:43.000]  because people see something made
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:45.000]  over a year and a half ago
[01:15:45.000 --> 01:15:47.000]  it freaks them out
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:49.000]  and I'm making all these predictions
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000]  and it's all happened
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000]  and I'm laying out the real political paradigm
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000]  of the globalist
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:57.000]  so I'm asking all of you right now
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:15:59.000]  go to google and then go to yahoo
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:01.000]  separately on their search systems
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:03.000]  and type the Obama deception in
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:05.000]  and close your browser or retype it in
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000]  and do it over and over again
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000]  if all of you will do it
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:11.000]  at least 10, 15 times a piece
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:13.000]  that will probably take you 3 or 4 minutes to do
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:15.000]  if you'll give 3 or 4 minutes
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:17.000]  number 1 or at least in the top
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:19.000]  2 or 3 links
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:21.000]  we can go above the Mel Gibson distraction
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:23.000]  above the Lindsay Lohan distraction
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:25.000]  I mean
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000]  in many of these lists we were looking at during the break
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:29.000]  the BP oil spill isn't even in the top 10
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000]  that's how these distractions work
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:35.000]  you know I culture jammed last week
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:37.000]  I knew full well that that was going to get
[01:16:37.000 --> 01:16:39.000]  conservatively I said
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:41.000]  that will get a half a million views the next week
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:43.000]  just on one version the video we upload
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000]  I talk about LeBron James being a distraction
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000]  and how people worshiped him
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000]  and how as the society
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:51.000]  implodes and as the foreign banks are taking over
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000]  that people are distracted by this
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:55.000]  and the media pushes it
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:57.000]  as a distraction telling you
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:59.000]  as a social creature
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:01.000]  that this is what is most important
[01:17:01.000 --> 01:17:03.000]  using social engineering programming
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:05.000]  and the video
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:07.000]  conservatively with the different versions

[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.000]  the suggestion is
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000]  that you
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:23.000]  in compliance with all your
[01:25:23.000 --> 01:25:25.000]  listeners realize that
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:27.000]  the world is grossly
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:29.000]  underpopulated
[01:25:29.000 --> 01:25:31.000]  because these best
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:33.000]  startles have been killing people
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:35.000]  and you don't have to use rocket science
[01:25:35.000 --> 01:25:37.000]  or Twitter or Google or anything
[01:25:37.000 --> 01:25:39.000]  if you slide an airplane
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.000]  in any direction you see almost no towns
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:43.000]  roads or civilization
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:45.000]  humans have this distortion
[01:25:45.000 --> 01:25:47.000]  because we're in mega cities
[01:25:47.000 --> 01:25:49.000]  right at 90% in the western world
[01:25:49.000 --> 01:25:51.000]  in Asia live in the cities
[01:25:51.000 --> 01:25:53.000]  so we're all congregated together
[01:25:53.000 --> 01:25:55.000]  and so we have this illusion
[01:25:55.000 --> 01:25:57.000]  that the world is overpopulated
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:25:59.000]  the globalists don't care about the environment
[01:25:59.000 --> 01:26:01.000]  they're genetic engineering and cross species
[01:26:01.000 --> 01:26:03.000]  chimeras that is the number one threat
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000]  according to all the scientists I've interviewed
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000]  in the literature I've read
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.000]  the globalist could care less about the environment
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:11.000]  but go ahead make your point
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:13.000]  well my point is
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000]  you and I are in total complete
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:17.000]  190%
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:19.000]  agreement with that
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:21.000]  and we need a guest on your show
[01:26:21.000 --> 01:26:23.000]  that's a real scientist
[01:26:23.000 --> 01:26:25.000]  or a real statistician
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:27.000]  that can tell you about the population
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:29.000]  of the United States
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:31.000]  Albert Lee Minnesota
[01:26:31.000 --> 01:26:33.000]  which is a Mexican
[01:26:33.000 --> 01:26:35.000]  city long before
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:37.000]  illegal immigration
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:39.000]  they cannot hold their population
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:41.000]  because of
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:43.000]  depopulation
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:45.000]  because of roundup ready corn
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:47.000]  soybeans
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:49.000]  and a myriad of other
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:51.000]  diabolical things that the enemy
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.000]  uses against us
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:55.000]  and
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:57.000]  also I was waiting for you to hit
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:59.000]  a talk point that I could really
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:01.000]  relate to and you mentioned
[01:27:01.000 --> 01:27:03.000]  the United Arab Emirates
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.000]  and I'll tell you
[01:27:05.000 --> 01:27:07.000]  about them I knew
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:09.000]  Sheikh Zayed Al-Nayan
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:11.000]  and I knew his wife
[01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.000]  and his court
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.000]  and I was part of his entourage
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:17.000]  at one point in time
[01:27:17.000 --> 01:27:19.000]  in my military history
[01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:21.000]  and my civilian history
[01:27:21.000 --> 01:27:23.000]  and those people are not
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.000]  warfare-ing their pro-life
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:27.000]  and I don't believe
[01:27:27.000 --> 01:27:29.000]  that any progeny
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:31.000]  of the United Arab Emirates
[01:27:31.000 --> 01:27:33.000]  wants to make war with
[01:27:33.000 --> 01:27:35.000]  enemy
[01:27:35.000 --> 01:27:37.000]  anybody
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:39.000]  they are one branch of Islam
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:41.000]  and they historically don't like the
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000]  Shiite Iran
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:45.000]  and so the Saudi Arabian Government
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:47.000]  has been making pro-war noises
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:49.000]  I know that's a separate country
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000]  but it borders the UAE
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000]  my geography is correct
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000]  that's correct isn't it
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:57.000]  UAE is different
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000]  than Saudi
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:01.000]  but I'm saying it borders it
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:03.000]  I know that
[01:28:03.000 --> 01:28:05.000]  well no I know you know that
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:07.000]  I'm just going from memory here
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:09.000]  it's there south of it
[01:28:09.000 --> 01:28:11.000]  it's one of the Emirates
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:13.000]  that's like Iowa to Minnesota
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:15.000]  and they're two different cultures
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:17.000]  I don't claim to be an expert
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000]  on the United Arab Emirates
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000]  I was reading Der Spiegel
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000]  UAE ambassador says
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:25.000]  country made back a US-Israeli attack
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000]  on Iran
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:29.000]  I prefer to your knowledge
[01:28:29.000 --> 01:28:31.000]  but it's not by their own volition entirely
[01:28:31.000 --> 01:28:33.000]  it's due to
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:35.000]  this empire
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:37.000]  this
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000]  this political empire
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:41.000]  that was not
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:43.000]  one back in
[01:28:43.000 --> 01:28:45.000]  I don't know 1400
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:47.000]  or whatever
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:49.000]  in England
[01:28:49.000 --> 01:28:51.000]  but anyhow
[01:28:51.000 --> 01:28:53.000]  well the UAE
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:55.000]  is what on the
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:57.000]  eastern shore
[01:28:57.000 --> 01:28:59.000]  of Saudi Arabia
[01:28:59.000 --> 01:29:01.000]  north of Oman
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000]  it is right there on the Persian Gulf
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000]  and so that's why they are
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:07.000]  a little paranoid about Iran having a nuke
[01:29:07.000 --> 01:29:09.000]  well they're also
[01:29:09.000 --> 01:29:11.000]  for many
[01:29:11.000 --> 01:29:13.000]  sovereign generations
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:15.000]  they were the
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000]  citadel of wisdom
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:19.000]  and peace
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:21.000]  and getting along with everybody
[01:29:21.000 --> 01:29:23.000]  no I know it's a big trading post
[01:29:23.000 --> 01:29:25.000]  very wealthy
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000]  and developed a lot of science there
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:29.000]  I'm just reading what the ambassador said
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:31.000]  but let's pray that's the case
[01:29:31.000 --> 01:29:33.000]  because I don't want World War 3 to start
[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000]  I appreciate your call
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:37.000]  and everybody knows my French Bulldogs name
[01:29:37.000 --> 01:29:39.000]  but good to hear from you TJ

[01:29:49.000 --> 01:29:51.000]  we're on the march
[01:29:51.000 --> 01:29:53.000]  the empire's on the run
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:30:21.000]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network

[01:30:25.000 --> 01:30:27.000]  with pancakes, biscuits
[01:30:27.000 --> 01:30:29.000]  and cornbread muffins

[01:30:43.000 --> 01:30:45.000]  summer fun with food just doesn't get any better

[01:30:59.000 --> 01:31:01.000]  the question is
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:03.000]  where should the American people
[01:31:03.000 --> 01:31:05.000]  draw their line in the sand
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000]  what have we got? a republic
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.000]  or a monarchy?
[01:31:09.000 --> 01:31:11.000]  a republic is based on a constitution
[01:31:11.000 --> 01:31:13.000]  which protects minority rights
[01:31:13.000 --> 01:31:15.000]  not democracy, not mob rule
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:17.000]  two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:19.000]  so they think they own our land
[01:31:19.000 --> 01:31:21.000]  our water, children, our education
[01:31:21.000 --> 01:31:23.000]  our money
[01:31:23.000 --> 01:31:25.000]  we have to define who we are
[01:31:25.000 --> 01:31:27.000]  and what we will tolerate
[01:31:27.000 --> 01:31:29.000]  somebody's gonna ask you what you did
[01:31:29.000 --> 01:31:31.000]  during the patriot uprising

[01:31:35.000 --> 01:31:37.000]  we have common law, knowledge is power

[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.000]  history challenge today
[01:33:33.000 --> 01:33:35.000]  and it was a totally brainwashing
[01:33:35.000 --> 01:33:37.000]  propaganda
[01:33:37.000 --> 01:33:39.000]  they didn't mention anything about Timothy McVeigh
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:41.000]  working for the FBI
[01:33:41.000 --> 01:33:43.000]  they made it look like you know that the
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000]  patriot movement is just another
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000]  we're a bunch of
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:49.000]  according to them we're just a bunch of neo-nazis
[01:33:49.000 --> 01:33:51.000]  which it's not true it's not true at all
[01:33:51.000 --> 01:33:53.000]  I mean what do you expect
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:55.000]  that's why cable television
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:57.000]  and broadcast TV are literally
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:59.000]  dying because people understand
[01:33:59.000 --> 01:34:01.000]  it's a bunch of propaganda and brainwashing
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:03.000]  I mean that
[01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:05.000]  yeah I mean that's what
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000]  I mean believe it or not Nazi Germany
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:09.000]  I mean they did that kind of propaganda
[01:34:09.000 --> 01:34:11.000]  I was like well these Jews are going to commit
[01:34:11.000 --> 01:34:13.000]  acts of terrorism we better shut them down
[01:34:13.000 --> 01:34:15.000]  they are threatening
[01:34:15.000 --> 01:34:17.000]  the fear
[01:34:17.000 --> 01:34:19.000]  that's exactly what the Soviets
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:21.000]  and everybody else did
[01:34:21.000 --> 01:34:23.000]  we know what we're seeing historically
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:25.000]  we know this is tyranny
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000]  yep and also
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:29.000]  now you covered how the
[01:34:29.000 --> 01:34:31.000]  elite funded Adolf Hitler and the Nazi
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:33.000]  war machine but
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:35.000]  could you also talk about how
[01:34:35.000 --> 01:34:37.000]  how the Rockefellers also funded
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:39.000]  the imperial Japanese because
[01:34:39.000 --> 01:34:41.000]  they were as sadistic as the Nazis
[01:34:41.000 --> 01:34:43.000]  especially in the rape of Nanking
[01:34:43.000 --> 01:34:45.000]  have you ever heard of that?
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:47.000]  yes I have well that's actually true
[01:34:47.000 --> 01:34:49.000]  there's one of the most wealthy families
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:51.000]  on the earth 110 years ago
[01:34:51.000 --> 01:34:53.000]  and they did
[01:34:53.000 --> 01:34:55.000]  fund the war machine of the Japanese
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:57.000]  and we did send the US military over there
[01:34:57.000 --> 01:34:59.000]  to train the Japanese
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:01.000]  and then Green lighted them to have a war
[01:35:01.000 --> 01:35:03.000]  with Russia
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:05.000]  they of course were our ally in World War 1
[01:35:05.000 --> 01:35:07.000]  then they got double crossed
[01:35:07.000 --> 01:35:09.000]  in the
[01:35:09.000 --> 01:35:11.000]  late 1930s and then into 41
[01:35:11.000 --> 01:35:13.000]  and I'm not saying the imperial Japanese were good
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:15.000]  they were bad
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:17.000]  they were very moral so were the Japanese
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:19.000]  but our rulers were evil
[01:35:19.000 --> 01:35:21.000]  and
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:23.000]  thousands of US troops
[01:35:23.000 --> 01:35:25.000]  went into quote private military arms
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.000]  funded by the US government
[01:35:27.000 --> 01:35:29.000]  hundreds of aircraft the best known flying
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:31.000]  Tigers and were attacking the Japanese
[01:35:31.000 --> 01:35:33.000]  all over Asia
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:35.000]  but predominantly in China
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:37.000]  and the Japanese did public protest
[01:35:37.000 --> 01:35:39.000]  their embassy protested for several years
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.000]  then there was an oil embargo
[01:35:41.000 --> 01:35:43.000]  against Japan
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:45.000]  the US was making noises about attacking
[01:35:45.000 --> 01:35:47.000]  Japanese controlled
[01:35:47.000 --> 01:35:49.000]  countries
[01:35:49.000 --> 01:35:51.000]  and so Japan decided to do a sneak attack
[01:35:51.000 --> 01:35:53.000]  to knock out our pacific fleet
[01:35:53.000 --> 01:35:55.000]  their midget submarines four of them
[01:35:55.000 --> 01:35:57.000]  attacked that morning two hours before
[01:35:57.000 --> 01:35:59.000]  they launched the attack two hours before
[01:35:59.000 --> 01:36:01.000]  several one got into the harbor
[01:36:01.000 --> 01:36:03.000]  another ran into reefs
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.000]  about a mile away from the harbor
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:07.000]  another got off course and came up on land
[01:36:07.000 --> 01:36:09.000]  and another was sunk and that's
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:11.000]  seeing it in
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000]  I said do this a few days I don't know if you saw it
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:15.000]  CNN.com
[01:36:15.000 --> 01:36:17.000]  did the United States start
[01:36:17.000 --> 01:36:19.000]  Pearl Harbor
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:21.000]  or did the United States attack Japan first
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:23.000]  and then they show an image of the submarine
[01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:25.000]  on the bottom and say the US sunk
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:27.000]  this midget submarine I think they said an hour
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:29.000]  and a half before I mean the point is the Japanese
[01:36:29.000 --> 01:36:31.000]  were coming to attack but when subs
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:33.000]  were attacking the navy was ordered
[01:36:33.000 --> 01:36:35.000]  to stand down still because they wanted
[01:36:35.000 --> 01:36:37.000]  that full image of dead
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:39.000]  sailors and airmen and
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:41.000]  Marines but I appreciate your call
[01:36:41.000 --> 01:36:43.000]  I cover that
[01:36:43.000 --> 01:36:45.000]  in my film Terror Storm in Terror Storm
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:47.000]  we have the CNN article but see I already
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:49.000]  knew this as a child
[01:36:49.000 --> 01:36:51.000]  we would come and visit
[01:36:51.000 --> 01:36:53.000]  my grandparents here in Austin
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000]  my mother's from Austin
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:57.000]  and we would
[01:36:57.000 --> 01:36:59.000]  I remember when I was probably ten years old because I loved war museums
[01:36:59.000 --> 01:37:01.000]  they took me to the pacific war museum
[01:37:01.000 --> 01:37:03.000]  it's the official war museum
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:05.000]  it's gotten a lot bigger than it was then
[01:37:05.000 --> 01:37:07.000]  it was the old home of Admiral Nimitz
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000]  landlocked in Fredericksburg, Texas
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.000]  200 miles from the coast
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:13.000]  and it was a hotel
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:15.000]  and the
[01:37:15.000 --> 01:37:17.000]  building
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:19.000]  it's a big building it shaped like the bow
[01:37:19.000 --> 01:37:21.000]  of a ship sticking out on
[01:37:21.000 --> 01:37:23.000]  Main Street there
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:25.000]  and now it's the George Herbert Walker
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000]  Bush
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000]  Pacific US Museum
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:31.000]  that is the museum for the pacific war in the US
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.000]  and they've got one of the midget subs
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:35.000]  and it was there when I was a kid
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:37.000]  and
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.000]  hidden in plain view
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:41.000]  they didn't point out that we attacked the Japanese
[01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:43.000]  it just said that morning they sunk
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:45.000]  this Japanese sub and three others
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:47.000]  and
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:49.000]  you can go there
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:51.000]  and see one of the subs
[01:37:51.000 --> 01:37:53.000]  that was attacking or coming into attack
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.000]  and got sunk but still Pearl Harbor
[01:37:55.000 --> 01:37:57.000]  was ordered to stand down
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000]  they just hide the trees in plain view
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:01.000]  does that take away from the heroism of the people
[01:38:01.000 --> 01:38:03.000]  that fought off the Japanese attack
[01:38:03.000 --> 01:38:05.000]  or those that died
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:07.000]  on the battleships
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.000]  no the point is the truth is the truth
[01:38:09.000 --> 01:38:11.000]  is the truth is the truth is the truth
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000]  and it's now declassified the US had broken the Japanese
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:15.000]  purple and blue coat and knew exactly what they were going to do
[01:38:15.000 --> 01:38:17.000]  weeks before they took weeks for that
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:19.000]  task force to steam from Japan
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000]  into that area of the pacific
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000]  that's way across the pacific if you look at the map
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000]  here's Japan
[01:38:25.000 --> 01:38:27.000]  here's Hawaii here's the west coast of the United States
[01:38:27.000 --> 01:38:29.000]  they had to come all the way
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000]  and the aircraft and the US submarines
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:33.000]  and all the islands we controlled
[01:38:33.000 --> 01:38:35.000]  they all knew they were coming
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:37.000]  and they were ordered to stand down and die
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:39.000]  okay and that's how compartmentalization works
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000]  the average guys out there playing volleyball
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000]  in the deck of the battleships
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:45.000]  they had no idea but the navy was ordered
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:47.000]  you stand down
[01:38:47.000 --> 01:38:49.000]  radar installations picked up
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000]  the planes coming in an hour before
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000]  ordered to stand down
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:55.000]  let's go ahead and talk to Tim
[01:38:55.000 --> 01:38:57.000]  in Washington you're on the air Tim
[01:38:57.000 --> 01:38:59.000]  yeah Alex how you doing today
[01:38:59.000 --> 01:39:01.000]  I'm doing alright sir welcome
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:03.000]  hey I've got a couple points for you and maybe
[01:39:03.000 --> 01:39:05.000]  a question and an idea as well
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:07.000]  have you considered calling
[01:39:07.000 --> 01:39:09.000]  for info warriors to meet and organize
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:11.000]  in mass and if you have
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:13.000]  and you haven't considered it
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:15.000]  how dangerous or viable would that be
[01:39:15.000 --> 01:39:17.000]  it'd be very viable sir
[01:39:17.000 --> 01:39:19.000]  but
[01:39:19.000 --> 01:39:21.000]  I have always decided to
[01:39:21.000 --> 01:39:23.000]  I've done some rally
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:25.000]  some events I've gone
[01:39:25.000 --> 01:39:27.000]  to events I've been invited to speak with Ron
[01:39:27.000 --> 01:39:29.000]  Paul and in Houston
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000]  and haven't gone because I go
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:33.000]  I say to myself is it better to get in a car
[01:39:33.000 --> 01:39:35.000]  and drive four hours and stay in a hotel
[01:39:35.000 --> 01:39:37.000]  or is it better to stay here
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:39.000]  and go on international television
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:41.000]  and do radio interviews
[01:39:41.000 --> 01:39:43.000]  and make my own videos that reach
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:45.000]  hundreds of millions
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:47.000]  and so it just bang for the buck
[01:39:47.000 --> 01:39:49.000]  bang for the energy buck
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:51.000]  for my time and energy it's better
[01:39:51.000 --> 01:39:53.000]  to sit here and just inform people about what's happening
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000]  point out solution states rights
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:57.000]  abolishing the Fed
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000]  things like that and in supporting groups
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000]  like we are change and the Liberty
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:03.000]  you know meetups that go
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.000]  on with the campaign
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:07.000]  for liberty I mean
[01:40:07.000 --> 01:40:09.000]  I've never wanted to be the big leader
[01:40:09.000 --> 01:40:11.000]  not just because that's even more
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:13.000]  dangerous to do that is part of it in the back of my mind
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:15.000]  but
[01:40:15.000 --> 01:40:17.000]  because the time the energy
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:19.000]  this radio
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:21.000]  show has power because we do
[01:40:21.000 --> 01:40:23.000]  it every day and we put out
[01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:25.000]  media every day for 15 years
[01:40:25.000 --> 01:40:27.000]  and it's
[01:40:27.000 --> 01:40:29.000]  powerful info
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:31.000]  but my mission is to wake people up
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:33.000]  and to empower them
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:35.000]  not
[01:40:35.000 --> 01:40:37.000]  not to just go out and say we're going to have events
[01:40:37.000 --> 01:40:39.000]  everywhere or we're going to I mean I promote
[01:40:39.000 --> 01:40:41.000]  other activists who say
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:43.000]  tax free 15
[01:40:43.000 --> 01:40:45.000]  or protest the IRS
[01:40:45.000 --> 01:40:47.000]  or
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:49.000]  go out and confront Al Gore everywhere he goes
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.000]  where he won't go out in public now
[01:40:51.000 --> 01:40:53.000]  people go and confront him and ends up being in the media
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:55.000]  that he's a liar I mean
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:57.000]  I just have a different strategic
[01:40:57.000 --> 01:40:59.000]  view
[01:40:59.000 --> 01:41:01.000]  we are building
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:05.000]  something that really is well designed
[01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:07.000]  and it's behind schedule and
[01:41:07.000 --> 01:41:09.000]  you know it costs more money than it was supposed to
[01:41:09.000 --> 01:41:11.000]  and a lot of other issues
[01:41:11.000 --> 01:41:13.000]  a first rate
[01:41:15.000 --> 01:41:17.000]  thing that's like meetup and
[01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:19.000]  social network and Facebook all rolled into one
[01:41:19.000 --> 01:41:21.000]  and it's being developed
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:23.000]  and it should be done in a few months Lord willing
[01:41:23.000 --> 01:41:25.000]  I mean if I quit making the film
[01:41:25.000 --> 01:41:27.000]  I'm doing it quit everything else I could haunt you
[01:41:27.000 --> 01:41:29.000]  make sure it got done we're trying
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.000]  people are doing a great job
[01:41:31.000 --> 01:41:33.000]  but
[01:41:33.000 --> 01:41:35.000]  what I want to do is just
[01:41:35.000 --> 01:41:37.000]  get people together I believe
[01:41:37.000 --> 01:41:39.000]  it's not so much can even be
[01:41:39.000 --> 01:41:41.000]  a dating site it's going to have something similar to that
[01:41:41.000 --> 01:41:43.000]  just where get your communities together create
[01:41:43.000 --> 01:41:45.000]  communities of family
[01:41:45.000 --> 01:41:47.000]  meet like minded people that's
[01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:49.000]  the true value that's more valuable than all the
[01:41:49.000 --> 01:41:51.000]  golden the hills is good friends
[01:41:51.000 --> 01:41:53.000]  and people who are of like minds
[01:41:53.000 --> 01:41:55.000]  coming together but does that answer
[01:41:55.000 --> 01:41:57.000]  your question it kind of does yes
[01:41:57.000 --> 01:41:59.000]  I also had a
[01:41:59.000 --> 01:42:01.000]  suggestion or maybe an idea for anybody else
[01:42:01.000 --> 01:42:03.000]  up there that maybe organizing
[01:42:03.000 --> 01:42:05.000]  a kind of an MLK
[01:42:05.000 --> 01:42:07.000]  March to Washington
[01:42:07.000 --> 01:42:09.000]  a civil disobedience of non
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.000]  participation where we just
[01:42:11.000 --> 01:42:13.000]  travel and march and just see how many
[01:42:13.000 --> 01:42:15.000]  people actually show up well that's a good
[01:42:15.000 --> 01:42:17.000]  idea but there have been hundreds of marches
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:19.000]  just in the last year and the media tries to
[01:42:19.000 --> 01:42:21.000]  ignore it but the alternative media covers it
[01:42:21.000 --> 01:42:23.000]  and so it is having an effect there isn't
[01:42:23.000 --> 01:42:25.000]  going to be one silver bullet but
[01:42:25.000 --> 01:42:27.000]  everybody just putting one foot in front of the other
[01:42:27.000 --> 01:42:29.000]  the and I appreciate your call great
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:31.000]  points just the power
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:33.000]  of you
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:35.000]  creating a one-line slogan in a website
[01:42:35.000 --> 01:42:37.000]  and putting it on power polls in your town
[01:42:37.000 --> 01:42:39.000]  chances are
[01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:41.000]  the Orwellian state will try to block
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:43.000]  you and then that censorship will get it
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:45.000]  all over the news
[01:42:45.000 --> 01:42:47.000]  how dare someone the media always takes the bait
[01:42:47.000 --> 01:42:49.000]  how dare someone put up signs of Obama
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:51.000]  as a joker with the word fascism
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:53.000]  or info wars dot com under it
[01:42:53.000 --> 01:42:55.000]  we need to arrest whoever did this
[01:42:55.000 --> 01:42:57.000]  and then they send a cop to the guy's house
[01:42:57.000 --> 01:42:59.000]  it happened in texas florida
[01:42:59.000 --> 01:43:01.000]  england then it becomes news why are
[01:43:01.000 --> 01:43:03.000]  you censoring then more people go out
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:05.000]  and do it that became an international phenomenon
[01:43:05.000 --> 01:43:07.000]  where each hundreds of millions of people
[01:43:07.000 --> 01:43:09.000]  conservatively was in hundreds of newscast
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:11.000]  hundreds of newspapers

[01:43:17.000 --> 01:43:19.000]  and had it on its front cover and made more people go out
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:21.000]  and do it
[01:43:21.000 --> 01:43:23.000]  it's unlimited

[01:43:29.000 --> 01:43:31.000]  it is a movement, a renaissance
[01:43:31.000 --> 01:43:33.000]  an enlightenment, an awakening
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:35.000]  a journey back to freedom
[01:43:35.000 --> 01:43:37.000]  a rediscover of the spirit of 1776
[01:43:37.000 --> 01:43:39.000]  a rediscovery of the spirit of liberty

[01:48:34.920 --> 01:48:38.440]  point blank they said it right there how will have been detected
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:41.560]  but the local folks around here have three four at tablets all over the
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:43.000]  shelves for kids children

[01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:59.320]  and now that we're exposing it it's just fluoride fluoride fluoride billboards
[01:48:59.320 --> 01:49:01.400]  fluoride fluoride fluoride
[01:49:01.400 --> 01:49:04.920]  it's the same thing with asper team as we were winning the battle a decade ago
[01:49:04.920 --> 01:49:09.400]  when it was just in a few uh... uh... gums and drinks
[01:49:09.400 --> 01:49:13.400]  and so the now it's in over 10 000 plus

[01:56:17.480 --> 01:56:20.840]  and of course we mentioned at the start of the show but bp stops
[01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:25.480]  oil leak into the gulf of mexico bp is
[01:56:25.480 --> 01:56:29.400]  seceded in stopping its gulf of mexico leak for the first time
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:34.680]  since an accident on april 20th killed 11 men and triggered a giant oil spill
[01:56:34.680 --> 01:56:38.200]  boosting its shares it's now boosted its shares
[01:56:38.200 --> 01:56:41.400]  and they're claiming that they have fixed it but next hour i'm going to cover
[01:56:41.400 --> 01:56:45.800]  this more rob do pointed this out i have a cnn transcript
[01:56:45.800 --> 01:56:51.320]  from today where they're interviewing different experts
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:56.280]  and they're saying that we have a considerable amount of pressure down on
[01:56:56.280 --> 01:57:00.040]  the reservoir forcing the hydrocarbons up to the
[01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:03.800]  wellbore we are looking for somewhere between eight thousand and nine thousand
[01:57:03.800 --> 01:57:07.160]  psi inside the capping stack which would indicate
[01:57:07.160 --> 01:57:10.360]  to us that the hydrocarbons are being forced up
[01:57:10.360 --> 01:57:14.200]  and the wellbores are being able to withstand the pressure
[01:57:14.200 --> 01:57:18.440]  and that is good news if they were down at four thousand to five thousand
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:22.840]  to six thousand range that could potentially tell us that the hydrocarbons
[01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:27.080]  are being diverted someplace else well so if four thousand shows that they're
[01:57:27.080 --> 01:57:34.920]  really diverting it somewhere else why then do we have
[01:57:36.280 --> 01:57:39.880]  video feeds that have been captured and we're trying to pull up these live but
[01:57:39.880 --> 01:57:43.160]  have had trouble we're going to work on this through the next hour
[01:57:43.160 --> 01:57:47.560]  headline bp oil gusher stopped what about the psi and it's at
[01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:55.960]  two thousand nine hundred in fact give me a document camp shot on this if you can
[01:57:56.680 --> 01:58:00.760]  so we're going to try to find out exactly what's going on with this
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:05.000]  now i pray they've kept it but how many times did they say they'd kept it it
[01:58:05.000 --> 01:58:07.320]  was stopped i mean they said that a month in
[01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:10.760]  they said it two months in i mean we're now what is it 87 88 days i don't know
[01:58:10.760 --> 01:58:14.120]  how many days in are we
[01:58:14.120 --> 01:58:18.520]  i mean this is ridiculous uh that they've lied in the past i mean i hope
[01:58:18.520 --> 01:58:21.880]  that this is the case and we'll all pray that that is the case
[01:58:21.880 --> 01:58:25.320]  they've now got hundreds and hundreds of millions of gallons of oil in the gulf
[01:58:25.320 --> 01:58:28.520]  most of it out at sea as the hurricanes come in
[01:58:28.520 --> 01:58:32.680]  that's the real crisis we're facing now i think a lot of this
[01:58:32.680 --> 01:58:37.480]  end of civilization stuff's being hyped uh but we've got to continue to look
[01:58:37.480 --> 01:58:42.600]  at it we'll be right back

[02:01:57.400 --> 02:02:01.160]  president that because he would follow the constitution he couldn't change
[02:02:01.160 --> 02:02:04.280]  everything and reverse what's happened he could be a focal point
[02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:07.800]  and a bully pulpit to do a lot and he's gonna run for president again folks he'll
[02:02:07.800 --> 02:02:11.000]  announce it in the next year or even sooner i mean he hasn't told me that but
[02:02:11.000 --> 02:02:14.520]  he says he thinks about it every day and he understands his responsibility and
[02:02:14.520 --> 02:02:19.000]  he is a statesman in a gaggle of criminal politicians
[02:02:19.000 --> 02:02:24.680]  and so uh you know i he couldn't fix it all himself i can't
[02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:29.800]  i get a lot more done being on the radio and tv and the film sir we are
[02:02:29.800 --> 02:02:34.520]  having an effect with what we're doing and politics is such a dirty business
[02:02:34.520 --> 02:02:38.840]  one time i got talked into filing for state rep and i dropped out in a week
[02:02:38.840 --> 02:02:41.720]  because i was getting so much support and freaked me out and i was reading the
[02:02:41.720 --> 02:02:45.480]  rules they've written the rules where you can't follow the law and get elected
[02:02:45.480 --> 02:02:49.480]  legally in the in the campaign rules that way they can selectively enforce
[02:02:49.480 --> 02:02:56.680]  against you um so at this point and i don't really ever
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:03:01.080]  intend to run for political office um
[02:03:01.080 --> 02:03:05.240]  at this point i don't intend to do that i'm just here covering the news and the
[02:03:05.240 --> 02:03:09.000]  information i mean we're reaching millions of people a day
[02:03:09.000 --> 02:03:12.520]  millions of new people every week it's growing exponentially
[02:03:12.520 --> 02:03:17.400]  why should we stop what's working i mean if it ain't broke don't fix it
[02:03:17.400 --> 02:03:20.440]  well i don't think you'd have to stop you could just do what you're doing and
[02:03:20.440 --> 02:03:24.840]  then have people come in and vote for you i mean it's not that you're wrong i
[02:03:24.840 --> 02:03:29.400]  completely agree with everything you say well it is incredibly corrupt because
[02:03:29.400 --> 02:03:32.840]  we do have a hundred percent election fraud i've proven it it's been even in
[02:03:32.840 --> 02:03:37.160]  the paper when i've caught them back in 98 and again in 2000 i mean it's just
[02:03:37.160 --> 02:03:40.280]  total fraud that's why you can't vote them out and they're stealing everything
[02:03:40.280 --> 02:03:44.040]  this is probably one of the most corrupt cities in the country
[02:03:44.040 --> 02:03:47.480]  it's also the most wealthy per capita and that's why the bloodsuckers are here
[02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:52.280]  they are they are looting the public uh so i mean i can't even run for office

[02:08:25.400 --> 02:08:29.400]  as a financial advisor and researchers had a great
[02:08:29.400 --> 02:08:34.920]  track record of protecting key trends with what's unfolded the dollar is
[02:08:34.920 --> 02:08:38.520]  dropping again the chinese have gotten rid of the united

[02:08:50.280 --> 02:08:54.120]  dictatorship takeover in the senate and the house

[02:09:09.560 --> 02:09:12.840]  it's uh... the only country in the world that i know of
[02:09:12.840 --> 02:09:18.040]  we can steal five billion dollars pay a fine of five hundred and fifty million
[02:09:18.040 --> 02:09:22.200]  so that means you take about four point five billion dollars in profit
[02:09:22.200 --> 02:09:29.880]  and that just proves crime pays in america it's a terrible example
[02:09:29.880 --> 02:09:34.520]  for people in college uh... especially
[02:09:34.520 --> 02:09:39.560]  and in business uh... to witness such a thing you know four months ago
[02:09:39.560 --> 02:09:44.360]  uh... the firm uh... that uh... is run by uh...
[02:09:44.360 --> 02:09:48.360]  mister buffett uh...
[02:09:48.360 --> 02:09:54.120]  berkshire hathaway they admitted that they had cheated the united states
[02:09:54.120 --> 02:09:56.840]  government to fraud at them out of three hundred million dollars
[02:09:56.840 --> 02:10:01.000]  and they paid a hundred million dollar fine and kept the rest
[02:10:01.000 --> 02:10:05.320]  and we can heart back to the late nineteen eighties
[02:10:05.320 --> 02:10:11.160]  uh... when we had that uh... scandal uh... uh... the milken scandal
[02:10:11.160 --> 02:10:15.160]  and uh... he stole three billion dollars gave a billion to act of the
[02:10:15.160 --> 02:10:19.640]  government and uh... spent a maybe eighteen months in jail
[02:10:19.640 --> 02:10:23.480]  and lived happily ever after and uh... you know
[02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:28.200]  there's two sets of rules and there's one for us
[02:10:28.200 --> 02:10:31.880]  and the other set of rules of uh... the alumnus and
[02:10:31.880 --> 02:10:36.840]  they get away with everything and it's really disgraceful and disgusting
[02:10:36.840 --> 02:10:41.640]  that they get charged chump change
[02:10:41.640 --> 02:10:46.520]  well they do and of course hundreds and hundreds of billions were given to
[02:10:46.520 --> 02:10:50.040]  uh... the larger consortiums that they then uh... you
[02:10:50.040 --> 02:10:54.760]  paid the money out via a i g when we see numbers in bloomberg we haven't got new
[02:10:54.760 --> 02:10:58.280]  numbers in seven months of twenty eight trillion
[02:10:58.280 --> 02:11:01.240]  uh... meet it out to the federal reserve and others
[02:11:01.240 --> 02:11:05.400]  in layman's terms break down the different ways they're looting us and how
[02:11:05.400 --> 02:11:07.880]  bloomberg arrived at the twenty eight
[02:11:07.880 --> 02:11:13.480]  uh... trillion number well i know exactly how they came to that number but i do
[02:11:13.480 --> 02:11:17.880]  know what they do and uh... number one uh... which
[02:11:17.880 --> 02:11:22.600]  is one of the worst things that they do is they'll do placements and underwritings
[02:11:22.600 --> 02:11:26.600]  and secondaries and as they place the stock
[02:11:26.600 --> 02:11:31.800]  all the bonds they shorted i mean here they are convincing people that they
[02:11:31.800 --> 02:11:36.440]  should go along uh... bonds in a y a b c company
[02:11:36.440 --> 02:11:42.200]  or stock in x y z company uh... or a private secondary
[02:11:42.200 --> 02:11:46.440]  uh... in omp company
[02:11:46.440 --> 02:11:49.240]  and the minute the thing is sold
[02:11:49.240 --> 02:11:53.720]  they're shorting the stock of the bond i mean they make a lot of money doing
[02:11:53.720 --> 02:11:57.800]  that and this latest fiasco with the dollar where
[02:11:57.800 --> 02:12:03.240]  on the usdx which is an index of six major currencies versus a dollar
[02:12:03.240 --> 02:12:06.840]  it went from having gone down to seventy four
[02:12:06.840 --> 02:12:11.080]  it went back up to eighty nine now what did that happen
[02:12:11.080 --> 02:12:14.520]  well what they did was they were instrumental
[02:12:14.520 --> 02:12:19.800]  in exposing greece now everybody knew who was in europe
[02:12:19.800 --> 02:12:24.680]  and in new york and they knew greece should have never been accepted into
[02:12:24.680 --> 02:12:28.840]  uh... the eurozone in the first place and they had two sets of books
[02:12:28.840 --> 02:12:33.000]  and how did they know that they set the two sets of books up for them
[02:12:33.000 --> 02:12:36.440]  and they lied about what they had and that they qualified
[02:12:36.440 --> 02:12:40.120]  and so what they and jp morgan chase did
[02:12:40.120 --> 02:12:45.480]  was that they shorted better that the euro was going to go down
[02:12:45.480 --> 02:12:49.400]  and they bought the dollar long starting last october
[02:12:49.400 --> 02:12:52.840]  well over the last month or six weeks what they've done
[02:12:52.840 --> 02:12:56.760]  is covered their short in the euro and uh...
[02:12:56.760 --> 02:13:02.360]  sold a long position in the dollar and re billions of dollars in profit
[02:13:02.360 --> 02:13:09.480]  and almost single-handedly destroyed the eurozone
[02:13:09.480 --> 02:13:13.800]  now the dollar is falling again because they're out of the market the
[02:13:13.800 --> 02:13:18.120]  manipulation is over and with the next stop
[02:13:18.120 --> 02:13:21.160]  well i think it's selling around eighty two right now so
[02:13:21.160 --> 02:13:24.920]  uh... we're probably going to get out at seventy four and it might even break and
[02:13:24.920 --> 02:13:31.000]  get out at seventy one eighteen which was the lowest low of all time
[02:13:31.000 --> 02:13:37.480]  what is that going to mean for gold well i think uh... it's my feeling
[02:13:37.480 --> 02:13:40.840]  that about fourteen fifteen months ago gold
[02:13:40.840 --> 02:13:46.040]  finally decoupled from the dollar and that happened because
[02:13:46.040 --> 02:13:50.360]  there's a choice there do you want to be long gold along the dollar
[02:13:50.360 --> 02:13:53.960]  the only real currency in the world is gold because it doesn't owe anybody
[02:13:53.960 --> 02:13:57.640]  anything and i think the realization is out
[02:13:57.640 --> 02:14:01.720]  there now that the gold is better than the dollar
[02:14:01.720 --> 02:14:05.080]  and so i think the reflection of what
[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:08.840]  the dollar does is only twenty percent
[02:14:08.840 --> 02:14:14.840]  into what gold does and when the big players like goldman and
[02:14:14.840 --> 02:14:19.080]  and morgan see and know that the dollar's going to get out
[02:14:19.080 --> 02:14:22.760]  they deliberately hit gold the other ones who are shorting gold today
[02:14:22.760 --> 02:14:27.480]  the two of them and i'm sure every time they push it down it just pops back up
[02:14:27.480 --> 02:14:31.320]  and now what was this one in telegraph report of this secret
[02:14:31.320 --> 02:14:35.000]  three hundred eighty ton are very close to the entire gold supply for one year
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:38.840]  what's mined and refined in one year uh... what was going on with that
[02:14:38.840 --> 02:14:42.680]  manipulation well first of all
[02:14:42.680 --> 02:14:48.360]  uh... i think it's fraudulent i don't think the event ever happened
[02:14:48.360 --> 02:14:52.920]  uh... i think they're lying uh... well you've always talked about that you've
[02:14:52.920 --> 02:14:56.520]  always talked about that uh... you say that
[02:14:56.520 --> 02:15:01.240]  uh... what happens uh... there is that they just say it on paper
[02:15:01.240 --> 02:15:08.040]  to drive down the price exactly and it is possible that they've done that but
[02:15:08.040 --> 02:15:13.160]  there's no reason to do it and first they said a commercial bank was involved
[02:15:13.160 --> 02:15:16.040]  and they don't do business with commercial banks only
[02:15:16.040 --> 02:15:22.440]  central banks now uh... of course the question arises
[02:15:22.440 --> 02:15:29.080]  the swapper uh... was it a central bank or a consortium of central banks
[02:15:29.080 --> 02:15:34.920]  or did a consortium exist at all you see they won't tell you these things
[02:15:34.920 --> 02:15:39.000]  and because they won't tell you these things you have to assume that they're
[02:15:39.000 --> 02:15:41.720]  lying there's no other way to go on it
[02:15:41.720 --> 02:15:46.040]  it's just like the cpi and the ppi and the employment figures
[02:15:46.040 --> 02:15:49.800]  they're lies and so you gotta assume that everything else is
[02:15:49.800 --> 02:15:53.720]  and let's expand yes it's no better bob i want you to continue on that line but
[02:15:53.720 --> 02:15:57.960]  i want to expand on that in layman terms for people
[02:15:57.960 --> 02:16:02.520]  if banks can sell each other 380 tons of gold secretly
[02:16:02.520 --> 02:16:05.640]  but but the higher level areas of the market
[02:16:05.640 --> 02:16:09.320]  know what's going on and it's reflected by selling it at a lower price and it's
[02:16:09.320 --> 02:16:13.000]  only on paper the gold never moves that's what gata
[02:16:13.000 --> 02:16:16.760]  and the congressional hearings have all reported on that's how they manipulated
[02:16:16.760 --> 02:16:20.520]  because it's a paper transaction uh... that they'll just
[02:16:20.520 --> 02:16:25.160]  quietly swap back later but specifically dealing with secrecy
[02:16:25.160 --> 02:16:28.360]  we have all these congressmen and senate members
[02:16:28.360 --> 02:16:31.640]  saying we want to know where these trillions went and the goldman sacks
[02:16:31.640 --> 02:16:36.040]  people and the uh... head of the federal reserve
[02:16:36.040 --> 02:16:39.880]  the the treasury head they'll never say where it goes that's an example
[02:16:39.880 --> 02:16:44.600]  of this out in the open incredibly insane secrecy
[02:16:44.600 --> 02:16:49.000]  and now uh... ron paul concurs with me so does napolitano reading the bill i
[02:16:49.000 --> 02:16:52.440]  want to get your take on it but even the washington post admits this new bill
[02:16:52.440 --> 02:16:56.040]  they've passed the financial reform gives a fellow reserve
[02:16:56.040 --> 02:17:00.360]  massive control over the economy and even less oversight
[02:17:00.360 --> 02:17:03.560]  uh... by congress the words the washington post almost total
[02:17:03.560 --> 02:17:07.160]  autonomy uh... so speak to that
[02:17:07.160 --> 02:17:12.280]  well they're absolutely right and uh... we've discussed this a long time ago and
[02:17:12.280 --> 02:17:16.520]  multiple times of the program and they're going to take over the sdc
[02:17:16.520 --> 02:17:20.280]  uh... the cftc which is commodity futures trading
[02:17:20.280 --> 02:17:23.880]  trading corporation uh... the fdic
[02:17:23.880 --> 02:17:28.920]  and a new agency uh... which is for consumer protection
[02:17:28.920 --> 02:17:32.200]  and they're going to have an oversight board which they approve
[02:17:32.200 --> 02:17:36.280]  appoint the people it's just like me saying well
[02:17:36.280 --> 02:17:40.120]  we're going to have a board to uh... oversee
[02:17:40.120 --> 02:17:44.440]  uh... talk radio programs and and alex is going to read it
[02:17:44.440 --> 02:17:48.280]  and lead the panel it's it's it's just silly
[02:17:48.280 --> 02:17:52.280]  and uh... it's obfuscation uh... it's
[02:17:52.280 --> 02:17:56.360]  the lack of transparency they don't want you to know what they're doing
[02:17:56.360 --> 02:17:59.480]  because if the public finds out what they're doing they'll say well how can
[02:17:59.480 --> 02:18:02.040]  we allow that and they'll try to stop it
[02:18:02.040 --> 02:18:05.320]  uh... we should be going the other way with the privately owned federal reserve
[02:18:05.320 --> 02:18:08.520]  we should be getting rid of it and of course that's what run call exactly
[02:18:08.520 --> 02:18:11.800]  instead of auditing it instead of abolishing it they're like
[02:18:11.800 --> 02:18:14.760]  here total control over everything in the economy
[02:18:14.760 --> 02:18:18.200]  including individuals debit cards that's in the bill
[02:18:18.200 --> 02:18:25.320]  and they don't agree not even look at curbing derivatives until 2022
[02:18:25.320 --> 02:18:28.920]  that's right which leaves them a long time
[02:18:28.920 --> 02:18:32.360]  to do their mischief and they'll they'll come up with something different at that
[02:18:32.360 --> 02:18:35.560]  time if in fact we've got a government at that time
[02:18:35.560 --> 02:18:40.360]  and these kind of things are what is driving people out of the country
[02:18:40.360 --> 02:18:44.920]  uh... the u.s government uh... day before yesterday
[02:18:44.920 --> 02:18:49.880]  imposed a full 450 dollar charge on people
[02:18:49.880 --> 02:18:53.880]  who want to give up their citizenship now
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:58.280]  they hadn't had a fee before but obviously they have a lot of people who
[02:18:58.280 --> 02:19:02.440]  are requesting that and i don't recommend people do that
[02:19:02.440 --> 02:19:06.120]  out of hand and if one were to want to do that
[02:19:06.120 --> 02:19:11.000]  you'd have to have a citizenship in another country
[02:19:11.000 --> 02:19:13.720]  before you do that because you'd never be able to go anywhere
[02:19:13.720 --> 02:19:17.960]  because you wouldn't have a passport so it's something to think about
[02:19:17.960 --> 02:19:22.520]  but this is a reflection of that and you know i get letters all the time
[02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:26.440]  what state do i go to what country do i go to how do i how do i get away from
[02:19:26.440 --> 02:19:29.960]  this monstrosity and quite frankly you don't you
[02:19:29.960 --> 02:19:32.920]  gotta fight them well that's right we're here today that's right

[02:24:11.800 --> 02:24:15.320]  of exactly what the globalists are doing and i've come to the realization this
[02:24:15.320 --> 02:24:18.360]  week that it is very clear that they're
[02:24:18.360 --> 02:24:21.880]  going to go for a full collapse total depression to try to
[02:24:21.880 --> 02:24:26.200]  bankrupt everyone and make people depend on government and consolidate
[02:24:26.200 --> 02:24:30.840]  the economy but at the same time as brazinski
[02:24:30.840 --> 02:24:33.480]  and others said people are now going past the
[02:24:33.480 --> 02:24:38.040]  puppet politicians and identifying the banking cartel as the source of
[02:24:38.040 --> 02:24:41.720]  corruption and oppression and so time is running out for them how do you see
[02:24:41.720 --> 02:24:46.520]  this unfolding well first of all you segue into
[02:24:46.520 --> 02:24:51.080]  exactly what i want i wanted to say and i was talking with jim corbett this
[02:24:51.080 --> 02:24:54.760]  morning and i had said uh why hasn't danie
[02:24:54.760 --> 02:24:59.240]  esslen come out with more information uh and jim tecker as well
[02:24:59.240 --> 02:25:03.560]  uh regarding the bill de berger meeting and jim says
[02:25:03.560 --> 02:25:07.160]  well because everybody knows about it now it's all out in the open
[02:25:07.160 --> 02:25:10.360]  and i said well that's because of talk radio and the internet and i said i
[02:25:10.360 --> 02:25:15.080]  guess you're right so uh they're going for it exactly
[02:25:15.080 --> 02:25:18.680]  as you say they are and they're going for the whole thing
[02:25:18.680 --> 02:25:22.360]  they want to take everything down so they can force us
[02:25:22.360 --> 02:25:26.040]  to accept their world government and we gotta stop them we have to inform the
[02:25:26.040 --> 02:25:29.160]  people we have to do the best we can in november
[02:25:29.160 --> 02:25:32.920]  uh to get rid of the charlatans and quirks out of congress and i think we
[02:25:32.920 --> 02:25:37.160]  might have some success at that but uh it's the truth
[02:25:37.160 --> 02:25:40.200]  we got to get more and more people the truth all over the world and that's what
[02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:44.360]  we're doing well before bill de berg even started this
[02:25:44.360 --> 02:25:49.080]  year a month and a half ago or so i wrote articles with paul
[02:25:49.080 --> 02:25:52.200]  watson saying you know bill de berg the open conspiracy
[02:25:52.200 --> 02:25:55.320]  and pointed out that now they say things at davos
[02:25:55.320 --> 02:25:59.000]  that we got in bill de berg documents from 50 years ago that they've released
[02:25:59.000 --> 02:26:02.120]  now they say things in the financial times of london that was secret
[02:26:02.120 --> 02:26:05.960]  they admit world government they admit they want an authoritarian system
[02:26:05.960 --> 02:26:09.560]  they admit all of this because they tried to deny it deny it as long as they
[02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:14.040]  could calling us conspiracy theorists now they just discredit themselves
[02:26:14.040 --> 02:26:18.360]  when they stonewall so they're admitting it but trying to put a spin on it
[02:26:18.360 --> 02:26:23.720]  and so they are definitely now naked in what they're doing
[02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:28.600]  that's right and that gives them exposure only one way
[02:26:28.600 --> 02:26:35.240]  and that's what leads me to believe that they're going to turn the episode in
[02:26:35.240 --> 02:26:39.800]  europe the five-week countries which can't pay their bills and
[02:26:39.800 --> 02:26:45.000]  can't pay the debt back i think they're going to allow
[02:26:45.000 --> 02:26:50.200]  again decentralization in europe and the reason i say that
[02:26:50.200 --> 02:26:55.000]  is that germany the german people who never wanted to be in the eu
[02:26:55.000 --> 02:26:58.680]  did not want to be in the euro and they still don't
[02:26:58.680 --> 02:27:05.400]  uh... are are discussing of the possibility of writing off two-thirds
[02:27:05.400 --> 02:27:09.880]  to one-half of all the debt of the five nations that are in trouble
[02:27:09.880 --> 02:27:14.600]  uh... euphemistically called pigs and i despise that i don't think they should
[02:27:14.600 --> 02:27:18.360]  use such a term no matter what you think of the countries
[02:27:18.360 --> 02:27:21.960]  and there's a lot of people who live in those countries that don't deserve that
[02:27:21.960 --> 02:27:27.240]  but um that's the way germany is pointing in this direction at that time
[02:27:27.240 --> 02:27:30.760]  and that will lead to a breakup of the euro
[02:27:30.760 --> 02:27:34.680]  uh... in force the uh... the elitist to go to
[02:27:34.680 --> 02:27:40.520]  the sdr uh special drawing right and it is a good chance it could break up the
[02:27:40.520 --> 02:27:44.600]  european union in that form of decentralization
[02:27:44.600 --> 02:27:48.520]  and that would be ultimately good for them if they could caught and can't get
[02:27:48.520 --> 02:27:50.840]  out of it the other way they can do it
[02:27:50.840 --> 02:27:54.600]  is by having a war and say hey we didn't do this the war did it
[02:27:54.600 --> 02:27:58.920]  i mean that wasn't our attention and so i i think that's what's coming down the
[02:27:58.920 --> 02:28:02.840]  pike uh... and i think the first one
[02:28:02.840 --> 02:28:07.160]  uh... after the euro collapses which i think it will
[02:28:07.160 --> 02:28:11.080]  uh... i think the the next event will be
[02:28:11.080 --> 02:28:17.320]  pressure in the u u by the u k which i think will withdraw
[02:28:17.320 --> 02:28:22.040]  and put on tariffs and goods and services and the u s will follow
[02:28:22.040 --> 02:28:26.840]  and that should break up the u and a lot of the treaty agreements
[02:28:26.840 --> 02:28:31.160]  between nations regarding free trade and globalization
[02:28:31.160 --> 02:28:36.040]  you're absolutely right bob uh... how do you
[02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:39.960]  see them trying to actually implement this federal reserve takeover because
[02:28:39.960 --> 02:28:43.960]  i've got reports here from abc news senator shelby and others say
[02:28:43.960 --> 02:28:50.120]  financial reform will be repealed well i hope they're right but in order to do
[02:28:50.120 --> 02:28:54.200]  that we have to help them and how do we help them
[02:28:54.200 --> 02:28:57.560]  we make sure that we get rid of
[02:28:57.560 --> 02:29:01.080]  lots of incumbents who are on the payroll
[02:29:01.080 --> 02:29:06.520]  of wall street banking insurance pharmaceutical companies and transnational
[02:29:06.520 --> 02:29:10.440]  conglomerates and if we can do that we get a shot at it
[02:29:10.440 --> 02:29:14.520]  now bob to throw this out as we go to break i i get emails calls and and and
[02:29:14.520 --> 02:29:18.440]  see comments on our site saying alex why are you against financial reform let's
[02:29:18.440 --> 02:29:21.240]  get the bankers the bankers run the congress
[02:29:21.240 --> 02:29:24.680]  this is giving them more power that this financial reform
[02:29:24.680 --> 02:29:28.040]  is like saying oh a demon possessed somebody so let's possess them with
[02:29:28.040 --> 02:29:32.360]  satan i mean it it it's so elementary
[02:29:32.360 --> 02:29:35.720]  and you're right and people just don't understand even people

[02:34:19.720 --> 02:34:22.600]  sites they look at what the top stories are
[02:34:22.600 --> 02:34:25.960]  you're able to drive it to the top if you put the term

[02:38:01.240 --> 02:38:04.200]  highlights uh things that are in the news the things

[02:38:08.040 --> 02:38:11.800]  they're our bread and butter all right kyle in missouri you're on the air go
[02:38:11.800 --> 02:38:16.040]  ahead hey alex how you doing good sir
[02:38:16.040 --> 02:38:19.640]  um i just listened to your show this afternoon and i noticed that you're
[02:38:19.640 --> 02:38:23.560]  asking everybody to do some circus on search engines and facebook
[02:38:23.560 --> 02:38:28.680]  twitter stuff like that um for those people who sit down at the computer
[02:38:28.680 --> 02:38:31.400]  five or six times a day just to check their stuff and
[02:38:31.400 --> 02:38:34.840]  then they get up and leave they're probably not going to think about
[02:38:34.840 --> 02:38:40.680]  doing the search for you um there are however really really simple to use
[02:38:40.680 --> 02:38:44.040]  add-ons for just about any browser out there
[02:38:44.040 --> 02:38:48.120]  that can automatically do searches for them or refresh current searches that
[02:38:48.120 --> 02:38:52.440]  they have um yeah like google will ask you
[02:38:52.440 --> 02:38:55.480]  hey do you want us to give you updates on this term
[02:38:55.480 --> 02:39:01.160]  yeah that and like uh extensions like just for example google has one and i
[02:39:01.160 --> 02:39:05.400]  use it for this exact purpose um called the
[02:39:05.400 --> 02:39:09.560]  see reload every no that's firefox firefox has one called reload
[02:39:09.560 --> 02:39:13.880]  every and it can set up a refresh for you
[02:39:13.880 --> 02:39:19.400]  uh randomly or every one second or 10 seconds or 10 minutes or
[02:39:19.400 --> 02:39:23.560]  however often you want to search for you and i'm not about this is that the
[02:39:23.560 --> 02:39:26.920]  mainstream media has these to push lindsay lohan and stuff
[02:39:26.920 --> 02:39:31.240]  the media is already doing this themselves right so this this is a tool
[02:39:31.240 --> 02:39:35.240]  that info warriors and patriots who just leave their computers on
[02:39:35.240 --> 02:39:38.440]  uh that they can install on their their browsers that will help
[02:39:38.440 --> 02:39:41.720]  do me a favor send me a list of those and i'm going to send it to watson and
[02:39:41.720 --> 02:39:43.960]  ask him to do a blurb or i'll have matt ryan do it
[02:39:43.960 --> 02:39:47.720]  erin's busy with filmmaking with me today uh but we need to get that done and
[02:39:47.720 --> 02:39:51.560]  have an article about this and have the add-ons there so people
[02:39:51.560 --> 02:39:55.000]  uh know what's going on bob what's your take on this
[02:39:55.000 --> 02:40:00.040]  i think it's a great idea uh and as you say uh others are doing that so why
[02:40:00.040 --> 02:40:03.400]  shouldn't we do it so let's do it and let's put
[02:40:03.400 --> 02:40:08.120]  that particular dvd right in the front of people so they can see what's really
[02:40:08.120 --> 02:40:12.360]  going on the obama deception kyle god bless you tom in texas you're on the
[02:40:12.360 --> 02:40:15.880]  year hi bob and alex
[02:40:15.880 --> 02:40:22.520]  hello hey listen now real quick bob do you do you see uh in the next six to nine
[02:40:22.520 --> 02:40:28.200]  months a breakdown a bankrupting of the local municipalities where the police
[02:40:28.200 --> 02:40:32.440]  departments and stuff can't run that was a question i meant to ask bob stay
[02:40:32.440 --> 02:40:35.480]  there because i want to throw that out i mean it's already happening in ohio
[02:40:35.480 --> 02:40:38.680]  in michigan and florida and california where they say we're not going to pave
[02:40:38.680 --> 02:40:42.840]  the streets in la the sidewalks uh we're going to lay off a bunch of cops they
[02:40:42.840 --> 02:40:46.760]  won't respond to burglary and robbery i mean this is really happening so i
[02:40:46.760 --> 02:40:50.600]  don't see it happening it's already happening in gerald salente's prediction
[02:40:50.600 --> 02:40:53.960]  of total collapse by december unfortunately looks like it may happen
[02:40:53.960 --> 02:40:58.840]  bob Chapman possible i don't think it's probable
[02:40:58.840 --> 02:41:02.840]  and one of the reasons why is people are going to have to be pushed to the very
[02:41:02.840 --> 02:41:05.880]  edge because people are not lawbreakers in america
[02:41:05.880 --> 02:41:09.640]  yes we have criminals but every society has crime it's almost like these
[02:41:09.640 --> 02:41:13.480]  police chiefs saying we're not going to stop crime they're trying to encourage
[02:41:13.480 --> 02:41:17.560]  a collapse no i just think they want to keep their
[02:41:17.560 --> 02:41:21.240]  jobs and and they want to do a good job generally speaking
[02:41:21.240 --> 02:41:25.320]  and it's great disappointment and i can understand that
[02:41:25.320 --> 02:41:28.680]  uh you know and i think they should think in terms of
[02:41:28.680 --> 02:41:33.240]  well it's not going to be forever either i mean if they if the states are the
[02:41:33.240 --> 02:41:36.040]  city of the county can raise enough money they can
[02:41:36.040 --> 02:41:39.720]  hire policemen back again well then bob give us your timeline i mean how bad's
[02:41:39.720 --> 02:41:43.160]  this depression going to get we are in a depression do you agree
[02:41:43.160 --> 02:41:49.400]  yes and we started a year ago february uh i think that the fed is going to go to
[02:41:49.400 --> 02:41:52.520]  uh creating money and credit hollow will at last
[02:41:52.520 --> 02:41:58.360]  probably two years uh what will that do it'll lift the economy exactly as you
[02:41:58.360 --> 02:42:03.960]  saw in the last five quarters where we gained about three and a half percent
[02:42:03.960 --> 02:42:08.520]  plus on gdp because two and a half trillion dollars was injected we know
[02:42:08.520 --> 02:42:11.880]  that's good numbers they claim unemployment's 9.4 and
[02:42:11.880 --> 02:42:16.280]  all the experts say it's over 22 well that's true
[02:42:16.280 --> 02:42:19.880]  the only thing is they're going to try to
[02:42:19.880 --> 02:42:23.480]  skate this thing through until after the next election
[02:42:23.480 --> 02:42:27.080]  not this one but the following one and that's what i think they're going to do
[02:42:27.080 --> 02:42:30.120]  to do it and what that'll be accompanied by
[02:42:30.120 --> 02:42:36.040]  higher inflation and it'll probably not uh unemployment back a point or two uh
[02:42:36.040 --> 02:42:41.800]  from 22.2 to perhaps 20.2 but it's not going to be
[02:42:41.800 --> 02:42:45.640]  substantial and that's what they'll get out of it we should get 14 percent
[02:42:45.640 --> 02:42:49.560]  inflation easy it might be much higher than that you're saying inflation
[02:42:49.560 --> 02:42:54.200]  okay tom anything else uh yes alex i just wanted to let you know here in
[02:42:54.200 --> 02:42:58.200]  san antonio yesterday we had a uh older much older
[02:42:58.200 --> 02:43:02.200]  plainclothes police officer from the city san antonio in here with two
[02:43:02.200 --> 02:43:06.120]  cosovo nationals and some one of our employees asked them so they were you
[02:43:06.120 --> 02:43:10.760]  guys from they said we're from cosovo and of course that alarmed me and i
[02:43:10.760 --> 02:43:14.600]  you know look at uh there's uh the police international
[02:43:14.600 --> 02:43:18.360]  you take a look at that company and then this guy looked like a storm trooper
[02:43:18.360 --> 02:43:22.200]  they were in a plainclothes car he let her out of the back door and it was
[02:43:22.200 --> 02:43:25.960]  very suspicious i mean so what do we have to see you know
[02:43:25.960 --> 02:43:29.480]  of san antonio police to and run around with cosovo nationals and police
[02:43:29.480 --> 02:43:32.680]  cars well i mean they're training with foreign troops everywhere we've shot
[02:43:32.680 --> 02:43:35.640]  the video we have the military admitting it i mean they they admit they want to
[02:43:35.640 --> 02:43:39.640]  use foreign assets domestically thank you tom joe from chicago
[02:43:39.640 --> 02:43:44.200]  you're on the air with bob chappan go ahead uh yes i'm really shocked that
[02:43:44.200 --> 02:43:49.800]  bob's a prognostication um i read that the europeans were
[02:43:49.800 --> 02:43:54.680]  predicting that the uh the euro would be up to a buck fifty by the uh by december
[02:43:54.680 --> 02:44:01.080]  uh basis uh that china uh has a uh was striving for a basket of currencies
[02:44:01.080 --> 02:44:04.200]  and number two china is very enraged about the
[02:44:04.200 --> 02:44:08.280]  these these these english american rating agencies that wanted to form their
[02:44:08.280 --> 02:44:11.640]  own what's your opinion bob yeah how does that tie into the triple a
[02:44:11.640 --> 02:44:15.240]  rating being lost for europe in the u.s
[02:44:15.240 --> 02:44:20.840]  well china is doing uh what's proper uh they're right in their assessment
[02:44:20.840 --> 02:44:27.880]  and uh you talk about another currency it's the sdr the chinese have been
[02:44:27.880 --> 02:44:32.840]  given the imf dollars and getting sdr's in return
[02:44:32.840 --> 02:44:36.040]  so they're behind that movement they're not against it
[02:44:36.040 --> 02:44:38.840]  and if you look at today's figures that just came out
[02:44:38.840 --> 02:44:41.960]  you'll see that uh in during the month of may
[02:44:41.960 --> 02:44:45.960]  uh china was a large seller of dollar denominated assets
[02:44:45.960 --> 02:44:50.040]  and so they're exiting the dollar as other countries are
[02:44:50.040 --> 02:44:53.480]  that was actually a cnbc today that they're for the first time moving on to
[02:44:53.480 --> 02:44:57.880]  the dollar uh they're uh not purchasing a lot of t-bills
[02:44:57.880 --> 02:45:01.480]  yeah that's visible uh and they've done some of that before
[02:45:01.480 --> 02:45:07.560]  which wasn't as visible and and so normally a year and a half ago
[02:45:07.560 --> 02:45:12.280]  uh 64 and a half percent of the foreign exchange of
[02:45:12.280 --> 02:45:15.960]  foreign nations was in u.s dollars that figure is around
[02:45:15.960 --> 02:45:20.120]  59 and a half right now so there's nothing going on
[02:45:20.120 --> 02:45:23.880]  and of course it's going to be expedited uh by the fall in the dollar
[02:45:23.880 --> 02:45:27.720]  and incidentally uh in that fall of the dollar
[02:45:27.720 --> 02:45:31.400]  which were we just experienced in in its in motion
[02:45:31.400 --> 02:45:35.960]  uh not only the chinese were sellers but other central banks as well were
[02:45:35.960 --> 02:45:40.440]  sellers and so uh all he did was get a second chance well our
[02:45:40.440 --> 02:45:44.360]  industrial base has collapsed our industrial base has collapsed
[02:45:44.360 --> 02:45:47.880]  our credit is collapsing our dollar is collapsing i mean
[02:45:47.880 --> 02:45:50.840]  we're already in a collapse collapse isn't imminent the question is how
[02:45:50.840 --> 02:45:55.400]  deep will it go thanks for the calls yo real fast bob how deep will it go
[02:45:55.400 --> 02:46:00.280]  extremely deep over a period of time and you know i don't like to pick dates it's
[02:46:00.280 --> 02:46:05.000]  very very very hard i mean i i i picked recently the
[02:46:05.000 --> 02:46:11.960]  circumstances of uh default and um a new currency the sdr
[02:46:11.960 --> 02:46:17.640]  and uh revaluation and devaluation but trying to put a time frame on it's
[02:46:17.640 --> 02:46:22.040]  extremely difficult because things change so fast so the same thing is true
[02:46:22.040 --> 02:46:25.320]  about insurrection in america or any other country
[02:46:25.320 --> 02:46:29.720]  it's there it's a latent we don't have the
[02:46:29.720 --> 02:46:33.640]  uh we may not have uh the local police forces
[02:46:33.640 --> 02:46:38.040]  to to keep order and that will expedite
[02:46:38.040 --> 02:46:42.120]  craziness so the volcano is active real bad but i don't know when but
[02:46:42.120 --> 02:46:47.960]  i think it's coming so the volcano is active and trending towards eruption
[02:46:47.960 --> 02:46:53.160]  right and you know gerald and can pick by december and he may well be right i just
[02:46:53.160 --> 02:46:56.120]  don't know i hope he's wrong bad we're gonna get there
[02:46:56.120 --> 02:47:01.000]  i hope he's wrong uh but he's a smart guy uh that's why we have him on uh let's
[02:47:01.000 --> 02:47:05.960]  go ahead and talk let's talk to duff in kansas you're on the air duff
[02:47:05.960 --> 02:47:10.920]  hi alec hi bob hey uh just a couple of things real quick you know um
[02:47:10.920 --> 02:47:14.360]  listening to you guys i i listen to your program
[02:47:14.360 --> 02:47:18.040]  daily i'm a i'm a prison planet tv subscriber but
[02:47:18.040 --> 02:47:22.040]  thank you and listening to you guys i've done a lot of things different
[02:47:22.040 --> 02:47:26.200]  uh and one one real good example that goes out to your listeners are
[02:47:26.200 --> 02:47:30.760]  our company which is a real small company changed our ira's
[02:47:30.760 --> 02:47:34.360]  and uh we got the pamphlets last night i went on uh
[02:47:34.360 --> 02:47:38.520]  went on the internet and uh was looking at their pamphlet comparing it to the
[02:47:38.520 --> 02:47:43.400]  s and p 500 which are retired new retirements connected to
[02:47:43.400 --> 02:47:47.160]  and uh started doing my research their graphs didn't match what the stock
[02:47:47.160 --> 02:47:51.400]  markets graphs showed their graphs were completely
[02:47:51.400 --> 02:47:57.800]  oh i don't know uh wrong but uh the first story i came across
[02:47:57.800 --> 02:48:02.360]  on my iphone connected to the s and p 500 was the collapse of
[02:48:02.360 --> 02:48:08.200]  middle-class society you know so i i do things completely different today as a
[02:48:08.200 --> 02:48:13.400]  result of listening to your program and uh the other point that i wanted to
[02:48:13.400 --> 02:48:17.080]  make is is uh the way i watch the news is also different
[02:48:17.080 --> 02:48:21.320]  you know i i uh i don't watch mainstream but one of my favorite news
[02:48:21.320 --> 02:48:26.280]  channels i do watch is rt and one of the most amazing things that they reported
[02:48:26.280 --> 02:48:30.680]  on last night was that uh russia and germany
[02:48:30.680 --> 02:48:36.680]  were having talks together about using food as a weapon
[02:48:36.680 --> 02:48:39.800]  wow i'm gonna have to look into that i'm on rt today
[02:48:39.800 --> 02:48:42.840]  uh coming up in about an hour and 15 minutes from now
[02:48:42.840 --> 02:48:46.840]  i'm scheduled to be on there live i i i appreciate your call but that was another
[02:48:46.840 --> 02:48:49.640]  question i had for bob and the the callers are reminding me of questions i
[02:48:49.640 --> 02:48:53.000]  had we have companies creating subsidiaries
[02:48:53.000 --> 02:48:56.440]  bankrupting the old one to steal pensions we have companies reducing pensions
[02:48:56.440 --> 02:48:59.640]  we have an acceleration of the government quote ordering
[02:48:59.640 --> 02:49:02.600]  private pension funds to invest in failed banks that's bloomberg
[02:49:02.600 --> 02:49:06.600]  anroiders uh and so we are seeing an acceleration
[02:49:06.600 --> 02:49:11.160]  of the system going after the pension funds bob your take on that
[02:49:11.160 --> 02:49:16.440]  well it's coming and i don't know when uh i know they're not going to tackle it
[02:49:16.440 --> 02:49:20.680]  before the next election uh if they do it it'll
[02:49:20.680 --> 02:49:24.520]  be after that time and if there's major changes
[02:49:24.520 --> 02:49:29.160]  uh i think they might have to put it off uh for some time
[02:49:29.160 --> 02:49:32.600]  although i see in the president administration
[02:49:32.600 --> 02:49:36.600]  things being brought forward which is suicidal and that would be suicidal as
[02:49:36.600 --> 02:49:39.960]  well under the terrible unemployment and
[02:49:39.960 --> 02:49:45.240]  debt circumstances uh and you just look at this immigration situation
[02:49:45.240 --> 02:49:49.640]  with arizona 90 percent 94 percent to survey say
[02:49:49.640 --> 02:49:53.400]  the people agree with arizona and yet the president's pushing it why is he
[02:49:53.400 --> 02:49:56.920]  pushing it because his hand was telling him that's what you're going to do
[02:49:56.920 --> 02:49:59.800]  well he has a mission people keep saying why is obama doing this it's
[02:49:59.800 --> 02:50:03.320]  destroying him he's a puppet he's birdcage liner he's
[02:50:03.320 --> 02:50:06.360]  a trash bag they'll they'll throw him out whenever they want
[02:50:06.360 --> 02:50:10.360]  god forbid they assassinate him but many are saying impeachment or embalment
[02:50:10.360 --> 02:50:14.600]  and uh you know he's got a job to do bob it's always great having you on god

[02:54:41.400 --> 02:54:45.320]  planning for you and it's the same thing in hundreds
[02:54:45.320 --> 02:54:49.720]  of globalist documents like eco science and others continuing it's now
[02:54:49.720 --> 02:54:53.160]  hitting what i call the mainstream mark morano the chief environmental
[02:54:53.160 --> 02:54:57.320]  advisor to the republicans population control advocate wanted to sterilize
[02:54:57.320 --> 02:55:01.720]  food and water and of course the previous chief aide to senator inhoff
[02:55:01.720 --> 02:55:06.120]  the point is he's pretty mainstream and he's now just quoting what's in
[02:55:06.120 --> 02:55:09.400]  the writings of paul urlick who also co-wrote this with the white house
[02:55:09.400 --> 02:55:13.320]  science are with john p holdren eco science
[02:55:13.320 --> 02:55:16.760]  so again that's starting to hit the news of course we covered all these news
[02:55:16.760 --> 02:55:21.480]  headlines constantly sterilize the poor and bring back the workhouse
[02:55:21.480 --> 02:55:24.200]  here's the wall street journal would recession be good for the environment
[02:55:24.200 --> 02:55:29.640]  lowering your carbon footprint all these propaganda pieces about how we've
[02:55:29.640 --> 02:55:34.440]  got a lower population time magazine saying the only child myth
[02:55:34.440 --> 02:55:38.360]  how it's good for the environment and the economy to not have children
[02:55:38.360 --> 02:55:41.880]  which is totally ridiculous who's going to pay for social security
[02:55:41.880 --> 02:55:45.000]  and the west is dying here and who do you think reads this the west
[02:55:45.000 --> 02:55:47.640]  it's the it's the middle class people not having kids
[02:55:47.640 --> 02:55:51.400]  i mean of course that's the globalist competition though they don't want
[02:55:51.400 --> 02:55:55.240]  any competition they want anybody who can even read to be dead like paul
[02:55:55.240 --> 02:55:58.440]  pot there's another one you in tax us taxpayers
[02:55:58.440 --> 02:56:03.080]  to subsidize a new un agency promoting abortion cns news
[02:56:03.080 --> 02:56:06.680]  and i want to go over some fluoride dangers environmental group
[02:56:06.680 --> 02:56:11.320]  slams food fluoride levels 900 parts per million
[02:56:11.320 --> 02:56:15.640]  in powdered eggs i mean one part per million
[02:56:15.640 --> 02:56:20.280]  doubles bone cancer brain damage imagine 900 parts per million
[02:56:20.280 --> 02:56:26.360]  and they just go through what the fda allows to be put in hundreds of foods
[02:56:26.360 --> 02:56:29.480]  that you're not being told about and they spray it on the crops
[02:56:29.480 --> 02:56:33.080]  as a pesticide as it kills bugs and then it leeches in and
[02:56:33.080 --> 02:56:37.720]  precipitates and concentrates within the food crops
[02:56:37.720 --> 02:56:41.960]  here's another one environmental group petitions epa to restrict fluoride
[02:56:41.960 --> 02:56:46.280]  pesticides uh just just it just goes on and on i just
[02:56:46.280 --> 02:56:50.840]  want to warn people about this excess fluoride paints water at anchorage
[02:56:50.840 --> 02:56:54.200]  military base high levels can lead to stomach
[02:56:54.200 --> 02:56:57.320]  ailments and even death that's the anchorage daily news i mean this is
[02:56:57.320 --> 02:57:01.000]  what's going on they put this in your water folks this is so sick
[02:57:01.000 --> 02:57:04.760]  they're doing it on purpose it's in the earlick books
[02:57:04.760 --> 02:57:07.800]  it's in the holdren books it's that they're doing it
[02:57:07.800 --> 02:57:12.600]  here's another one time magazine death by fluoride goes back to a guy
[02:57:12.600 --> 02:57:15.640]  who killed a bunch of mental patients by putting
[02:57:15.640 --> 02:57:21.960]  extra fluoride in their milk and in their eggs i mean that's time magazine
[02:57:21.960 --> 02:57:27.480]  death by fluoride 85 of kids drink snacks contain
[02:57:27.480 --> 02:57:32.280]  could contain high levels of lead that's mainstream news i mean this is the type
[02:57:32.280 --> 02:57:36.840]  of stuff that i'm looking at each and every day
[02:57:36.840 --> 02:57:40.040]  they bankrupt you to drive you into submission they bankrupt you to make you
[02:57:40.040 --> 02:57:43.240]  be under the control of the government they socialize health care so they can
[02:57:43.240 --> 02:57:46.360]  literally have panels that decide what health care you get this is on record
[02:57:46.360 --> 02:57:50.840]  this is what the white house is now saying here's cns news obesity rating for
[02:57:50.840 --> 02:57:55.160]  every american must be included in stimulus mandated electronic health
[02:57:55.160 --> 02:57:59.320]  records tracking how much you weigh that's in the stimulus bill
[02:57:59.320 --> 02:58:04.440]  that's passed we have got to warn everyone i mean
[02:58:04.440 --> 02:58:08.200]  it's ridiculous we should take over our cities peacefully and say no fluoride
[02:58:08.200 --> 02:58:10.920]  and when they say they're putting fluoride in that's
[02:58:10.920 --> 02:58:14.920]  a catch term for hundreds of other deadly chemicals we should tell them don't
[02:58:14.920 --> 02:58:17.960]  genetically modify our crops don't genetically modify the salmon with
[02:58:17.960 --> 02:58:21.320]  insect genes when the studies show it will
[02:58:21.320 --> 02:58:24.840]  cause the regular salmon's population to go extinct within 40
[02:58:24.840 --> 02:58:27.720]  generations that's 40 years one generation a year
[02:58:27.720 --> 02:58:31.560]  i mean that's mainstream news mclatchy newspapers they admit the aspartame's
[02:58:31.560 --> 02:58:34.600]  causing miscarriages and death mainstream news
[02:58:34.600 --> 02:58:38.920]  we got to warn people this is more important than lindsay low hand
[02:58:38.920 --> 02:58:58.280]  it's incredible
