[04:09.520 --> 04:13.320]  we pointed that out and we posted it that we don't know if this really happened
[04:13.320 --> 04:18.160]  but this is coming out in the hacker circles it appears to be accurate from

[07:33.320 --> 07:38.320]  real American or anybody else for that matter worldwide that loves truth and
[07:38.320 --> 07:43.880]  loves freedom would respond what am I talking about no I'm not talking about
[07:43.880 --> 07:48.920]  that the health care bill that's past the house now it's passed out a committee
[07:48.920 --> 07:52.600]  gonna go to full debate in the next few weeks they're probably gonna pass it

[08:12.320 --> 08:18.800]  security on that is now on BBC and boing boing and other places finally it was
[08:18.800 --> 08:24.200]  leaked by hackers yet again doing a great job it's been leaked and the White
[08:24.200 --> 08:27.640]  House confirms it's a national security violation they're trying to hunt down who
[08:27.640 --> 08:33.200]  leaked it a total takeover of the internet tax taxes on the internet
[08:33.200 --> 08:38.600]  shutting down the web as we know if you ever file share no judge no jury your

[09:50.160 --> 09:56.360]  almost don't even want to cover it here in the first segment I mean not because
[09:56.360 --> 10:02.040]  of hype but because it necessarily needs to be the finale we need to build up
[10:02.040 --> 10:07.560]  towards this we need to explain to people how important this is and give you
[10:07.560 --> 10:15.200]  the backstory the history of it but because time is of the essence I'm

[11:21.920 --> 11:30.320]  from several major hacking services white hat hackers good guys and most
[11:30.320 --> 11:35.560]  hackers are white hat either that other teenage kids screwing around who haven't
[11:35.560 --> 11:41.400]  grown up yet Paul Watson curtain MO posted it and it was
[11:41.400 --> 11:46.360]  unconfirmed and we said this is unconfirmed we can't get a response from
[11:46.360 --> 11:54.760]  these universities but we're trying to find out if this is true or not thousands
[11:54.760 --> 12:00.960]  and thousands and thousands of internal correspondence between the United
[12:00.960 --> 12:07.520]  Nations and the main universities that they use to certify their IPC global
[12:07.520 --> 12:13.000]  warming information where they say the earth is going to flood all the major

[12:17.000 --> 12:22.360]  the earth is heating it's unnatural carbon dioxide is a poison it's not the
[12:22.360 --> 12:28.080]  sun causing it and the head professor for the UN he is the main individual they
[12:28.080 --> 12:32.440]  use for all their data of all these universities they have on their payroll
[12:32.440 --> 12:37.520]  for five years he's refused to give Dr. Tim Ball who's in my film fall the

[12:42.840 --> 12:49.920]  has refused to give them his data saying it's proprietary though it's being used

[12:57.560 --> 13:02.440]  TVs above 40 inches taxing all the others I mean total government control
[13:02.440 --> 13:07.040]  thousands of new taxes one child policies worldwide being called for

[13:13.040 --> 13:17.440]  size of your cardiovascular system of carbon dioxide is what plants breathe
[13:17.440 --> 13:27.600]  then they release oxygen that animals mammals insects breathe now over 30,000
[13:27.600 --> 13:31.920]  top scientists countered the 300 scientists that the UN had in the last
[13:31.920 --> 13:37.320]  two years published papers saying it was a fraud said this is a complete fraud a
[13:37.320 --> 13:42.920]  takeover of the carbon cycle listing life and respiration as criminal this is
[13:42.920 --> 13:48.800]  a fraud they got fired they lost their jobs over 90% of college and
[13:48.800 --> 13:52.920]  institutional private research is government funded there has been a
[13:52.920 --> 13:59.200]  purge they have said it's like Holocaust denial to talk about it or to discuss it
[13:59.200 --> 14:05.280]  and Al Gore's major university sources have been caught faking buoy data on
[14:05.280 --> 14:10.080]  Arctic and Atlantic and Pacific temperatures saying it was hotter than
[14:10.080 --> 14:14.280]  it really was and they always say it's an accident when they get caught they've
[14:14.280 --> 14:19.920]  been caught hundreds of times putting out fake data ladies and gentlemen the
[14:19.920 --> 14:23.920]  universities that were hacked now admit they've been hacked it is confirmed
[14:23.920 --> 14:27.960]  there are criminal investigations of the hackers which is wonderful because it
[14:27.960 --> 14:33.600]  only certifies this is real they admit it's real and the hackers got all the
[14:33.600 --> 14:39.240]  secret documents how they how the big fake environmentalists admit it's all a
[14:39.240 --> 14:45.400]  lie the earth is cooling carbon dioxide is good for you and these people knew it
[14:45.400 --> 14:50.600]  the whole time now we already knew they knew we already knew they were grabbing
[14:50.600 --> 14:55.560]  a hold of industrial society we already have the UN population reports 1996
[14:55.560 --> 14:59.160]  biological diversity assessment saying it's a way to make humans the enemy and
[14:59.160 --> 15:03.120]  the club of Rome and the Council on Foreign Relations reports we already have

[15:08.200 --> 15:12.360]  program saying this is a way to shut down human industrial capacity so we can
[15:12.360 --> 15:20.720]  control everybody but the hackers got all the secret documents it's an AP it's
[15:20.720 --> 15:26.240]  in Washington Post but they're reporting it like it's no big deal oh well they got
[15:26.240 --> 15:31.480]  caught saying hide data they got caught and and they kind of whitewashing but
[15:31.480 --> 15:37.120]  the whitewash is completely devastating this is absolute nails in their coffin
[15:37.120 --> 15:42.280]  if we get this out because the AP and Reuters and all this is bad but it's a
[15:42.280 --> 15:47.360]  whitewash we have the actual emails and documents and WikiLeaks has them up on

[20:05.840 --> 20:11.520]  Alex Jones Broadcasting Network let me add them
[20:16.680 --> 20:23.240]  okay for radio listeners we have caught the chief climatologist the main
[20:23.240 --> 20:29.560]  research group at a British University talking to all these other
[20:29.560 --> 20:35.800]  universities about how to demonize climate skeptics other scientists going
[20:35.800 --> 20:39.000]  we'll wait your data is fake but that's not even important compared to the other
[20:39.000 --> 20:45.920]  news how to put out fake info and how to cover up the real data showing the
[20:45.920 --> 20:49.960]  earth has actually been cooling the last four years and that the Sun is the
[20:49.960 --> 20:54.960]  major driver now the reason hackers hit this guy and this particular
[20:54.960 --> 20:59.320]  university is that he's the main one cited by the United Nations saying the
[20:59.320 --> 21:03.560]  earth is heating at the oceans are gonna rise and we're all basically dead if we
[21:03.560 --> 21:09.960]  don't pay a tax to Al Gore and the UN separately I have the new EU president
[21:09.960 --> 21:15.600]  announcing 2009 is the first year of global governance and global management
[21:15.600 --> 21:20.280]  saying they're gonna use the carbon tax to control the world what did ban Chi moon
[21:20.280 --> 21:24.600]  three Sundays ago saying the New York Times he's the UN Secretary General in
[21:24.600 --> 21:29.880]  an article titled we can do it he said global government global governance
[21:29.880 --> 21:34.680]  will be financed and controlled through carbon taxes that will allow us to
[21:34.680 --> 21:39.240]  regulate and control all facets of world life and all resource management
[21:39.240 --> 21:42.560]  will go through these unelected corporations that control the UN
[21:42.560 --> 21:48.560]  this is the UN head saying this who's the other UN head head of the Security
[21:48.560 --> 21:53.640]  Council Barack Obama no presidents ever served is that the average American
[21:53.640 --> 21:57.040]  doesn't even know that's happening that's what we cover in my film fall of
[21:57.040 --> 22:02.280]  the Republic available on DVD at info wars.com that's why that film so
[22:02.280 --> 22:06.760]  important because if they get this carbon tax legislation through at
[22:06.760 --> 22:11.440]  Copenhagen in Europe and in the US it's over folks total control they're now
[22:11.440 --> 22:16.320]  trying to pass this in the next month and it is a godsend that these
[22:16.320 --> 22:23.520]  conscientious white hat hackers who I bow to I prostrate myself I thank you I
[22:23.520 --> 22:29.320]  I hail you I I oh you are wonderful oh my god oh my god this is so beautiful
[22:29.320 --> 22:32.760]  what you've done now we started reporting on this Tuesday Wednesday and
[22:32.760 --> 22:39.680]  Thursday when it was only on the big hacking sites now AP Reuters BBC they're
[22:39.680 --> 22:45.120]  all confirming yes the Washington Post admits it but says nothing about the
[22:45.120 --> 22:49.360]  lying nothing about how these head universities with the UN were all
[22:49.360 --> 22:54.760]  colluding and racketeering how to lie and how to persecute scientists and fire
[22:54.760 --> 22:59.560]  them and remove them who were criticizing him he wouldn't release his
[22:59.560 --> 23:05.720]  data for five years he refused to release it when the UN was using it as an
[23:05.720 --> 23:10.520]  excuse to say carbon dioxide's deadly and is making the temperature rise now I'm
[23:10.520 --> 23:14.880]  going to read to you the AP article for prisonplanet.tv viewers give them a
[23:14.880 --> 23:19.320]  screenshot right now for radio listeners just google the term or go to
[23:19.320 --> 23:24.760]  smartpage.com and google the term search the term hackers leak emails stoke
[23:24.760 --> 23:29.680]  climate debate now even though the AP had to report on this we need to push and
[23:29.680 --> 23:33.120]  make sure this becomes big nightly news everywhere right in the middle of this
[23:33.120 --> 23:38.520]  big man-made climate change global tax push this headline should be hackers
[23:38.520 --> 23:43.200]  release emails proving global warming of fraud because their emails which we have
[23:43.200 --> 23:48.080]  up at info wars.com and prisonplanet.com they were posted earlier in the week
[23:48.080 --> 23:52.200]  Paul Watson is reposting them but even though I saw these and even though they
[23:52.200 --> 23:56.360]  looked authentic and had seals and letterhead we said well this is being
[23:56.360 --> 24:00.240]  reported we don't know if it's true it's now confirmed the universities
[24:00.240 --> 24:04.080]  investigating the british government's investigating the US government the UN
[24:04.080 --> 24:08.680]  are saying how dare these hackers this is illegal how dare them rob us they are
[24:08.680 --> 24:16.560]  not denying this this is admitted let me say that again they are not denying
[24:16.560 --> 24:22.400]  this now Al Gore got caught this week by climatologists in Florida got no
[24:22.400 --> 24:29.080]  attention on Monday Friday morning Paul Watson wrote an article at prisonplanet
[24:29.080 --> 24:34.200]  our site so big it made national news got picked up by scores of newspapers
[24:34.200 --> 24:38.440]  Rush Limbaugh had it as his top headline all day he sourced prisonplanet
[24:38.440 --> 24:43.200]  where Al Gore photoshopped a NASA photo and we got the NASA photo right next to
[24:43.200 --> 24:48.080]  it and put hurricanes spinning the wrong direction the US flooded and he said
[24:48.080 --> 24:51.800]  oh this is what NASA says is going to happen no Al Gore has been caught
[24:51.800 --> 24:58.200]  fraudulently photoshopping that made national news Friday okay we are
[24:58.200 --> 25:02.680]  breaking through everything we cover now becomes national news ladies and
[25:02.680 --> 25:07.240]  gentlemen there hasn't been nothing we've ever done on the climate issue as
[25:07.240 --> 25:13.080]  is important as what I'm about to read I'm gonna read the AP whitewash and this
[25:13.080 --> 25:18.840]  is devastating this is red-handed now listen and listen carefully give me a
[25:18.840 --> 25:23.880]  close shot of this for prisonplanet.tv viewers hackers leak emails stoke
[25:23.880 --> 25:31.980]  climate debate associated press David Stranger computer hackers have broken
[25:31.980 --> 25:35.720]  into a server at a well respected climate change research center in Britain
[25:35.720 --> 25:39.840]  and posted hundreds of private emails and documents online stoking debate
[25:39.840 --> 25:44.120]  over whether some scientists have overstated the case for man-made climate
[25:44.120 --> 25:48.360]  change now that should say the devastating emails admit a systematic
[25:48.360 --> 25:53.280]  form of persecution and racketeering against scientists in groups disagreeing
[25:53.280 --> 25:57.120]  with the UN's agenda in their own internal documents they admit the earth is
[25:57.120 --> 26:00.440]  actually cooling and that carbon dioxide isn't causing it but they don't say
[26:00.440 --> 26:04.120]  that go read the actual emails in fact later if I have time we're going to read
[26:04.120 --> 26:06.960]  some of those and we're going to be covering this all next week in a
[26:06.960 --> 26:13.880]  Thanksgiving Paul Watson Kurt Nemo doing huge stories right now now listen the
[26:13.880 --> 26:17.600]  University of East Anglia and what's important that's the main university the
[26:17.600 --> 26:22.600]  UN sites in eastern England said in a statement Saturday that the hackers had
[26:22.600 --> 26:26.240]  entered the server and stolen data at its climate research unit a leading
[26:26.240 --> 26:30.240]  global research center on climate change see they're admitting this is their
[26:30.240 --> 26:34.640]  emails they all need to go to prison I mean they're in here going we got to get
[26:34.640 --> 26:38.120]  this guy fired we got to go after this person we got to get their papers banned
[26:38.120 --> 26:41.680]  we got to run this guy out of business they're talking about ruining
[26:41.680 --> 26:46.120]  scientists lives and I've met a lot of these scientists interviewed their
[26:46.120 --> 26:49.600]  communists their socialists their their conservatives they're just scientists
[26:49.600 --> 26:54.320]  they don't have a political axe they go the earth's cooling it's the sun why are
[26:54.320 --> 26:59.440]  you saying carbon dioxide is bad Al Gore got caught two years ago showing that
[26:59.440 --> 27:04.880]  carbon dioxide goes up on that famous graph and then the temperatures go up
[27:04.880 --> 27:08.320]  but the real graph released by NASA and all these universities from ice core
[27:08.320 --> 27:14.240]  studies show that the temperature goes up and then carbon dioxide goes up in the
[27:14.240 --> 27:18.320]  next hundred years because it releases carbon dioxide from the water from the
[27:18.320 --> 27:22.640]  ice and there's more plant life more animal life and it boosts the total
[27:22.640 --> 27:28.160]  amount the scientists that expose Gore lost their jobs it doesn't matter if
[27:28.160 --> 27:33.200]  Gore is now retracted they persecute people they get people fired that's in
[27:33.200 --> 27:37.640]  these emails okay okay I'm gonna cover it it's just there's so many facets to
[27:37.640 --> 27:43.160]  this evil the University of East Anglia and Eastern England said in a statement
[27:43.160 --> 27:47.240]  Saturday that the hackers had entered the server and stolen data at its climate
[27:47.240 --> 27:52.200]  research unit a leading it is the leading global research center on climate
[27:52.200 --> 27:58.040]  change the universe is AP AP AP the university said police are investigating
[27:58.040 --> 28:02.440]  the theft of information but could not confirm and it goes on more than a
[28:02.440 --> 28:07.640]  decade of correspondence between leading British and US scientists is
[28:07.640 --> 28:12.960]  included in about 1,000 emails in 3,000 documents posted on the websites
[28:12.960 --> 28:18.000]  following the security breach last week some climate change skeptics and
[28:18.000 --> 28:21.400]  bloggers claim the information shows scientists have overstated the case of
[28:21.400 --> 28:24.920]  global warming and alleged the documents contain proof that some researchers
[28:24.920 --> 28:28.920]  have attempted to manipulate data yeah and and the police should be seizing all
[28:28.920 --> 28:34.480]  of these servers now before they erase it and then claim that it was never there
[28:34.480 --> 28:38.160]  and claim it's fake but they're but they messed up they're admitting it's real
[28:38.160 --> 28:41.560]  and throwing a fit just like the White House memo and the Downing Street memo
[28:41.560 --> 28:46.360]  where Bush and Blair are talking about staging events that is now confirmed to
[28:46.360 --> 28:48.640]  be real because of the criminal investigation in the White House
[28:48.640 --> 28:53.600]  admitted it we're gonna come back and read the bombshell developments where
[28:53.600 --> 29:00.880]  they fake the data they know it's a fraud we'll be right back this is Alex

[34:38.440 --> 34:45.040]  the Associated Press Reuters BBC Washington Post they're all having to
[34:45.040 --> 34:53.840]  report that the internal emails between the UN and the University of East
[34:53.840 --> 34:59.400]  Anglia their main research body the climate research unit the leading
[34:59.400 --> 35:03.760]  global research center on climate change who've been accused of creating fake
[35:03.760 --> 35:07.880]  data and over and over again it's been found that what they claim from global
[35:07.880 --> 35:12.440]  weather stations that they're saying it's hotter than what scientists in any
[35:12.440 --> 35:16.680]  and other universities and research firms go to those other universities and
[35:16.680 --> 35:20.040]  actually get their their their temperature records and it's not what
[35:20.040 --> 35:24.280]  these universities not just East Anglia but others are saying see they've been
[35:24.280 --> 35:30.160]  caught over and over again but now they could say oh we made a mistake no now
[35:30.160 --> 35:35.240]  we have them where they're openly colluding where they're openly
[35:35.240 --> 35:41.280]  manufacturing it in one leaked email the research center director Phil Jones
[35:41.280 --> 35:44.600]  writes to colleagues about graph showing climate statistics of the last
[35:44.600 --> 35:49.560]  millennium he alludes to a technique used by fellow scientists to hide the
[35:49.560 --> 35:54.840]  decline that's a quote hide the decline in recent global temperatures see this
[35:54.840 --> 36:02.300]  is like all of those remember a hundred years ago piltdown man and all those
[36:02.300 --> 36:07.200]  other cases where they would find a pig jaw and put fake teeth in it and claim
[36:07.200 --> 36:10.680]  they'd found the missing link and they'd always get caught this is scientific
[36:10.680 --> 36:17.760]  fraud even if it I mean if it ever was we have these people their entire new
[36:17.760 --> 36:22.680]  old-order plan rest on the global carbon tax and they are bleeding to death in

[38:36.400 --> 38:41.640]  wanting to come in with a forced management system over the planet let me
[38:41.640 --> 38:45.120]  read you again out of the associated press and you read the emails they're
[38:45.120 --> 38:54.200]  even worse this is a whitewash and it's devastating this is coffin nails Phil
[38:54.200 --> 38:58.760]  Jones writes to colleagues about graph showing climate statistics over the
[38:58.760 --> 39:01.600]  millennium he eludes the technique used by a fellow scientist to hide the decline
[39:01.600 --> 39:05.080]  that's a quote hide the decline in recent global temperatures some evidence
[39:05.080 --> 39:11.520]  appears to show a halt in the rise of global temperatures at about 1960 we
[39:11.520 --> 39:15.320]  better be glad we were in a warming trend because normally it's freezing cold
[39:15.320 --> 39:21.200]  Jones wrote that in compelling data he had just completed Mike's nature trick
[39:21.200 --> 39:25.520]  of adding in the real temps to each series the 20 years from 1981 onwards
[39:25.520 --> 39:31.760]  and from 61 for Keith to hide the decline more emails I mean this guy needs to be
[39:31.760 --> 39:37.160]  immediately rated but that won't happen because the government wants this
[39:37.160 --> 39:40.960]  doesn't matter we're gonna carry the ball you're gonna carry the ball we're
[39:40.960 --> 39:43.760]  gonna get and Paul Watson's doing an article right now he's doing a blurb
[39:43.760 --> 39:47.160]  tonight more throughout the next week we reported this three days ago but now
[39:47.160 --> 39:52.400]  it's confirmed they are now admitting it it's kind of like when I got the Mayak
[39:52.400 --> 39:55.160]  and Homeland Security documents earlier this year saying the Homeland
[39:55.160 --> 39:58.560]  Security is really for the American people to take our private property to
[39:58.560 --> 40:03.480]  arrest patriots gun owners veterans conservatives libertarians and even
[40:03.480 --> 40:09.040]  though I got it from two state police officers and a federal marshal they were
[40:09.040 --> 40:12.120]  so freaked out I got it from multiple sources and even though I called the FBI
[40:12.120 --> 40:15.640]  off the secret phone number on it and they said where did you get this who
[40:15.640 --> 40:18.960]  gave it to you you're gonna be investigated I mean I knew it was real
[40:18.960 --> 40:23.600]  and they flipped out on the phone it was like watch commander yes Alex Jones
[40:23.600 --> 40:28.120]  Alex Jones even who I was when I called Homeland Security baby they know who I
[40:28.120 --> 40:32.080]  am because they know I defend the Republic and they do the opposite that
[40:32.080 --> 40:37.200]  didn't mean all of them are criminals but the the leaders of it are but I
[40:37.200 --> 40:41.120]  didn't come out and say it was real till a week after we broke it when it was AP
[40:41.120 --> 40:48.320]  Reuters Fox News nationwide international news we weren't sure this was real five
[40:48.320 --> 40:56.720]  days ago it is now confirmed the use of the word trick by Jones has been seized
[40:56.720 --> 40:59.080]  on by skeptics what do you mean we have his email saying we're going to trick
[40:59.080 --> 41:04.040]  people and fake the data hide the decline these are quotes who say his
[41:04.040 --> 41:07.160]  email offers proof of collusion between scientists and distort evidence to
[41:07.160 --> 41:10.800]  support the assertion that human activity is influencing climate change now
[41:10.800 --> 41:17.040]  it's even worse not only are they in there faking the data which they've been
[41:17.040 --> 41:21.920]  caught over and over again but they always say it's an accident they're in
[41:21.920 --> 41:25.960]  these emails I have separate mainstream articles quoting the emails we have the
[41:25.960 --> 41:30.120]  emails up on info wars dot com and prison planet dot com not only do we have
[41:30.120 --> 41:36.680]  that but we have them talking about how to persecute and get fired and remove
[41:36.680 --> 41:42.840]  and destroy scientists and scientific institutions that were proving their
[41:42.840 --> 41:47.840]  research of fraud see hackers began to follow this guy white hat hackers and
[41:47.840 --> 41:52.920]  they and they noticed for five years he wouldn't release his source data and
[41:52.920 --> 41:59.280]  they've now hacked him this is just like just like hackers got the White House
[41:59.280 --> 42:04.280]  memo and the Downing Street memos four years ago remember those where Bush is
[42:04.280 --> 42:07.320]  meeting in England and then at the White House with Tony Blair two separate
[42:07.320 --> 42:11.040]  meetings saying we can fly jets shoot them down blame it on Saddam this is
[42:11.040 --> 42:18.320]  from 2002 2003 the two meetings one 2002 one 2003 the Downing Street memos 2002
[42:18.320 --> 42:25.280]  2003 right before the March invasion and Bush is talking about how they can stage
[42:25.280 --> 42:29.000]  a shoot down and Tony Blair is not agreeing and how the stage terror attacks
[42:29.000 --> 42:39.840]  and and that was then confirmed to be real oh oh this is this bigger bigger this
[42:39.840 --> 42:44.800]  is so beautiful so wonderful I'm gonna come back finish up with this get into
[42:44.800 --> 42:49.640]  the other global government news as the new head of the EU openly announces

[51:09.200 --> 51:12.440]  years of fighting these people as hard as I can I see everybody starting to
[51:12.440 --> 51:18.840]  wake up it's so good it's so exciting as the people learn that their destiny is
[51:18.840 --> 51:21.800]  to beat the new world order you know they told the founding fathers it was
[51:21.800 --> 51:24.920]  revelations and at the end of the world lay down to King George the third they
[51:24.920 --> 51:28.720]  didn't listen they told Europeans lay down to Hitler it was the end of the
[51:28.720 --> 51:32.080]  world people didn't listen and we beat them and we're gonna beat the Stalin's
[51:32.080 --> 51:36.200]  and the Hitler's in the mouths of the 21st century we're going to beat them
[51:36.200 --> 51:41.880]  together or we're gonna die trying okay I gotta get settled down here what am I
[51:41.880 --> 51:47.320]  so excited about five days ago we posted major hacking sites reporting that
[51:47.320 --> 51:52.200]  have always been credible in the past a lot of these are you know top computer
[51:52.200 --> 51:54.840]  people making a half million bucks a year that are doing this I don't know
[51:54.840 --> 51:58.160]  who did it but I know some of the groups and let me tell you these are hardcore
[51:58.160 --> 52:02.880]  people and and and and let me tell you something exposed and fraud the cops
[52:02.880 --> 52:12.520]  won't do it the FBI MI5 won't do it the people are forced to do it and it is so
[52:12.520 --> 52:16.360]  beautiful they hacked them it's an AP Reuters you name it all the internal
[52:16.360 --> 52:20.440]  emails with the UN and their major universities pushing the line that
[52:20.440 --> 52:23.920]  carbon dioxide is a deadly poison and the earth's gonna flood and that polar
[52:23.920 --> 52:28.720]  bears can't swim and all this stuff and it all came out that was internally they
[52:28.720 --> 52:33.560]  knew it was a fraud and we're lying and faking the data and everybody kept
[52:33.560 --> 52:37.760]  going well this data shows it's getting colder it was getting hotter we go in a
[52:37.760 --> 52:42.040]  natural cycle and you know look at Mars its ice caps were getting smaller the
[52:42.040 --> 52:46.000]  last 40 years and suddenly they're getting bigger again and the whole solar
[52:46.000 --> 52:50.320]  system is getting cold again because the sun cooled off and is not putting off
[52:50.320 --> 52:56.800]  any major coronal ejections the sun flares you know I'm a sunspots it look
[52:56.800 --> 53:02.280]  like a spot through the telescope anybody's taking astronomy knows about
[53:02.280 --> 53:05.320]  this and and I have all these climatologists on who lose their jobs
[53:05.320 --> 53:09.760]  get fired lose their research funding and they're just telling the truth it's
[53:09.760 --> 53:13.640]  in here how to get people fired how to make them lose their funding how to get
[53:13.640 --> 53:17.480]  there's institutions shut down how to stop their papers from getting published
[53:17.480 --> 53:22.640]  it's all in here caught red-handed you little bastards excuse me I'm not gonna
[53:22.640 --> 53:26.040]  talk like that anymore it's because that's mean to women nothing wrong with
[53:26.040 --> 53:29.600]  people that didn't have a daddy I mean there's nothing wrong with that they're
[53:29.600 --> 53:33.600]  far worse than that I mean there's nothing no I'm serious cockroaches
[53:33.600 --> 53:37.120]  cockroaches serve a purpose that's not fair to call these people cockroaches
[53:37.120 --> 53:43.120]  lying larceness manipulative control freaks that want to seize our entire
[53:43.120 --> 53:48.160]  society through scientific fraud that's what they are that's what you are a
[53:48.160 --> 53:53.720]  bunch of lion vipers and I'm calling you out and the people the world are calling
[53:53.720 --> 54:00.680]  you out and we are exposing you so there's the AP and there's a lot of other
[54:00.680 --> 54:04.720]  exciting news the bad news is they passed it out a committee and it's going to
[54:04.720 --> 54:08.400]  the full floor for debate of the Senate and it looks like they're going to pass
[54:08.400 --> 54:12.440]  the government grabbing of health care but we can reverse that later and still
[54:12.440 --> 54:17.800]  try to beat it in the next month as bad as that is it's nothing compared to a
[54:17.800 --> 54:23.480]  world government taxing mechanism now you read the Club of Rome you read the
[54:23.480 --> 54:26.120]  UN documents you read the State Department documents that I've made
[54:26.120 --> 54:30.320]  films about written books about that we post on my websites but that isn't as

[1:07:08.400 --> 1:07:14.000]  planet and then I'm gonna play Gordon Brown and Al Gore saying the same thing
[1:07:14.000 --> 1:07:17.760]  the UN secretary-general three weeks ago in an editorial for the New York Times
[1:07:17.760 --> 1:07:23.440]  they told you none of this existed told you it was a social taboo to talk about
[1:07:23.440 --> 1:07:27.840]  it don't talk about politics and religion new
[1:07:27.840 --> 1:07:34.280]  older doesn't exist because all these old-timers 50 30 20 10 a year ago were
[1:07:34.280 --> 1:07:37.920]  telling you all this you were told doesn't exist doesn't exist doesn't exist
[1:07:37.920 --> 1:07:42.920]  now openly they're saying the carbon tax is to fund their world government and
[1:07:42.920 --> 1:07:49.680]  then we have AP reporting five days after we reported it hackers leak
[1:07:49.680 --> 1:07:55.160]  email stoke climate debate AP how they knowingly manufactured and lied about the
[1:07:55.160 --> 1:08:00.240]  data the carbon dioxide isn't bad that the earth is actually cooling not
[1:08:00.240 --> 1:08:05.880]  heating that it peaked in 1960 that it's a natural cycle and how to destroy other
[1:08:05.880 --> 1:08:10.240]  scientists that's what's criminal how to destroy other scientists that did their
[1:08:10.240 --> 1:08:15.320]  own research and said this was a fraud this is so huge this is the taxing
[1:08:15.320 --> 1:08:18.120]  mechanism for the world government let's play these clips and we're going to
[1:08:18.120 --> 1:08:24.840]  your calls here is von rompy Herman von rompy the new head of the EU
[1:08:24.840 --> 1:08:30.040]  dictatorship the countries can't even get out of it here he is be overcome by a
[1:08:30.040 --> 1:08:36.480]  joint effort in our and between our countries 2009 is also the first year
[1:08:36.480 --> 1:08:40.320]  of global governance with the establishment of the G20 in the middle
[1:08:40.320 --> 1:08:46.800]  of the financial crisis the climate conference in Copenhagen is another step
[1:08:46.800 --> 1:08:54.000]  towards the global management of our planet our mission our presidency is
[1:08:54.000 --> 1:09:04.880]  one of hope supported by acts and by deeds all right now that's a BBC
[1:09:04.880 --> 1:09:10.000]  translation it's up on info wars.com and prison planet.com now
[1:09:10.000 --> 1:09:14.640]  McClatchy's released the documents that the banks engineered the crisis to create
[1:09:14.640 --> 1:09:18.200]  a depression then they gave themselves tens of trillions of dollars of tax
[1:09:18.200 --> 1:09:22.000]  money to get the government further in debt they take our money and buy up real
[1:09:22.000 --> 1:09:27.400]  assets the G20 is running the global government they say the IMF will be the
[1:09:27.400 --> 1:09:31.720]  bank of the world you pay your carbon taxes to this is just made offer Ken
[1:09:31.720 --> 1:09:35.320]  lay Ken lay by the way it's come out in Congress he came up with a carbon tax
[1:09:35.320 --> 1:09:39.720]  plan in the mid 90s with Al Gore Al Gore sure didn't invent the internet but he
[1:09:39.720 --> 1:09:44.840]  did invent this carbon scam with Ken lay so here we are exposing them as complete
[1:09:44.840 --> 1:09:50.920]  frauds that's why I'm so excited here's Gordon Brown we are engaging in a deep
[1:09:50.920 --> 1:09:55.840]  process of reform and restructuring of our international financial system for
[1:09:55.840 --> 1:10:00.840]  now and for the future and we have maintained our commitment to help the
[1:10:00.840 --> 1:10:06.520]  world's poorest and we have put more money aside for that and also for a green
[1:10:06.520 --> 1:10:13.120]  recovery these are not just a single collection of actions this is collective
[1:10:13.120 --> 1:10:18.400]  action people working together at their best I think a new world order is
[1:10:18.400 --> 1:10:22.480]  emerging and with it the foundations of a new and progressive era of
[1:10:22.480 --> 1:10:26.920]  international cooperation and he goes on and on describing a new world order just
[1:10:26.920 --> 1:10:30.960]  Google Gordon Brown new order there's literally 30 40 50 speeches I'm seeing
[1:10:30.960 --> 1:10:35.880]  new ones every few days now the third world people know the IMF and World Bank
[1:10:35.880 --> 1:10:40.160]  have been caught that got leaked in 2002 BBC their internal documents where
[1:10:40.160 --> 1:10:44.680]  they're bankrupting economies by design so he's just helping the poor yeah the
[1:10:44.680 --> 1:10:48.960]  green recovery means shutting down all your industry that's left so only big
[1:10:48.960 --> 1:10:52.760]  banks can operate and control the governance system so they decide who
[1:10:52.760 --> 1:10:58.000]  can have a business here is Al Gore talking about global governance while in
[1:10:58.000 --> 1:11:05.640]  England the awareness itself that will drive the change and one of the ways it
[1:11:05.640 --> 1:11:11.160]  will drive the change is through global governance and global agreements but the
[1:11:11.160 --> 1:11:16.560]  many business leaders who have been present here are among those taking
[1:11:16.560 --> 1:11:22.680]  leadership in other ways we talked for example about we heard it this morning
[1:11:22.680 --> 1:11:30.440]  about efficiency and Jerry made that point of very well we waste so much
[1:11:30.440 --> 1:11:38.800]  energy that if we really put our minds to the implementation of a determined
[1:11:38.800 --> 1:11:45.800]  focused persistent sustained effort to eliminate these wasteful practices then
[1:11:45.800 --> 1:11:50.960]  we would not need the new power generation at anything like the levels
[1:11:50.960 --> 1:12:00.120]  that are now being discussed today take the average coal-fired electricity
[1:12:00.120 --> 1:12:08.400]  generating plant in the United States today 30 percent okay so there's Al
[1:12:08.400 --> 1:12:14.680]  Gore talking about global governance now now let's be clear here they're gonna
[1:12:14.680 --> 1:12:17.760]  decide who can have energy they're going to decide who's wasteful they're going
[1:12:17.760 --> 1:12:20.920]  to decide what kind of TV you can have and how much meat you can eat it's now
[1:12:20.920 --> 1:12:25.760]  mainstream news AP Reuters BBC you name it we can pull these up that will all
[1:12:25.760 --> 1:12:31.560]  have global ID cards that our carbon credits are on I mean this is total
[1:12:31.560 --> 1:12:34.800]  feudalism in fact pull up the definition of feudalism and surf them for me
[1:12:34.800 --> 1:12:38.840]  printed off definition of feudalism and surfed them and I know the definitions
[1:12:38.840 --> 1:12:43.480]  but I want to give the exact definition because in their own UN documents they
[1:12:43.480 --> 1:12:48.800]  say neo feudalism neo surfdom in the United Nations biological diversity
[1:12:48.800 --> 1:12:53.400]  assessment 1996 they say that and they say they're going to use carbon taxes
[1:12:53.400 --> 1:12:57.960]  to destroy industrial society
[1:12:57.960 --> 1:13:06.320]  lords vassals and slaves lords vassals and serfs then it gives all the
[1:13:06.320 --> 1:13:10.240]  definitions give me that's a Wikipedia definition I want to marry in Webster's
[1:13:10.240 --> 1:13:13.240]  just actual definition not a full encyclopedia only give them just the
[1:13:13.240 --> 1:13:19.240]  basic it's a political system ruled by hegemonic lords with the people or
[1:13:19.240 --> 1:13:25.560]  serfs or slaves all right I said I'm going to your calls here and I
[1:13:25.560 --> 1:13:29.280]  apologize to listeners we got a new phone system in it and we got to fix this it
[1:13:29.280 --> 1:13:33.200]  keeps dropping the college we'll have 20 callers on it just drops them so we get
[1:13:33.200 --> 1:13:37.680]  hung up on callback 8882012244 but the live of me I can't figure it out around
[1:13:37.680 --> 1:13:43.800]  here let's go to Mario in California Mario you're on the air sir it takes
[1:13:43.800 --> 1:13:50.760]  to take my car Alex what do you think about the news go ahead man you got me
[1:13:50.760 --> 1:13:56.520]  pumped up for real the news is great and you know every day it seems to always
[1:13:56.520 --> 1:14:00.360]  get a little bit weirder but a little bit cooler at the same time that's all right
[1:14:00.360 --> 1:14:03.920]  you know I have to give it up to Ron Paul man he's been in this fight for so
[1:14:03.920 --> 1:14:10.040]  long and to see the the fruits of his labor coming to you know coming to to
[1:14:10.040 --> 1:14:15.680]  blossom the way that it is so cool man because of you know I got to just kind
[1:14:15.680 --> 1:14:20.160]  of when I will watch old clippings of Ron Paul I mean back in the day this guy
[1:14:20.160 --> 1:14:27.240]  is talking about odd it's in the fed 1971 1972 and here's the deal almost 30
[1:14:27.240 --> 1:14:31.760]  years Ron Paul didn't win the presidency but he created a whole movement we
[1:14:31.760 --> 1:14:35.320]  created a movement together and it's like a 12 round or 10 round or three
[1:14:35.320 --> 1:14:39.480]  round boxing match we complain when in the first or second or third or fourth
[1:14:39.480 --> 1:14:45.080]  round he doesn't win but get some licks in and then even when he almost wins in
[1:14:45.080 --> 1:14:50.120]  around people gripe at him no he's in there as a competitor for the truth
[1:14:50.120 --> 1:14:54.920]  kicking butt and so we've got to have the long view of history we've got to
[1:14:54.920 --> 1:14:57.880]  know it's not going to be instant how many how many times have I preached
[1:14:57.880 --> 1:15:04.280]  about that a lot hey but I as just a kind of a person just coming in and seeing
[1:15:04.280 --> 1:15:10.360]  you know me being only seeing him run the first time I was impressed if that was
[1:15:10.360 --> 1:15:13.880]  the first round baby I'm feeling good about the fight you know they'd seen
[1:15:13.880 --> 1:15:19.080]  Ron Paul go through the the the assault that he had to end the election and
[1:15:19.080 --> 1:15:23.600]  still come out shining like he is right now is beautiful and by the way he
[1:15:23.600 --> 1:15:28.320]  served one one term in the mid-70s and got beaten and came back a decade plus
[1:15:28.320 --> 1:15:42.560]  later Mario God bless you good to have you on board

[1:20:57.120 --> 1:21:03.160]  the carbon dioxide's good that the earth's actually been cooling because of
[1:21:03.160 --> 1:21:07.360]  the sun going partially dormant compared to what it had been and that it's all a
[1:21:07.360 --> 1:21:10.680]  fraud and how they persecuted all these scientists and got them fired I mean

[1:24:17.440 --> 1:24:21.520]  bill but the media says they're against it it's always it's like the banks said
[1:24:21.520 --> 1:24:26.520]  they were against the income tax when they financed it in 1913 to pay debt to
[1:24:26.520 --> 1:24:32.480]  the Federal Reserve they financed absolutely I gotta jump I gotta jump

[1:25:24.360 --> 1:25:29.520]  told that there's a possibility that governors may be able to request fire
[1:25:29.520 --> 1:25:34.280]  arms from the federal government to give to the citizens to arm themselves have
[1:25:34.280 --> 1:25:40.680]  you heard anything about this say that again the governors have the can are
[1:25:40.680 --> 1:25:45.320]  able to request from the federal government firearms in order to in order
[1:25:45.320 --> 1:25:49.680]  to arm the citizens yeah yeah that's under the second amendment and it's the
[1:25:49.680 --> 1:25:53.080]  state's supposed to control the National Guard that wasn't fully
[1:25:53.080 --> 1:25:57.960]  federalized till 19 till 2007 with the John Warner Defense Authorization Act
[1:25:57.960 --> 1:26:02.520]  the states until 1913 when we got the income tax the private fellow reserve
[1:26:02.520 --> 1:26:08.160]  and the 17th amendment the legislatures that we elect they would vote and appoint
[1:26:08.160 --> 1:26:13.320]  senators the states completely run the feds and the Congress runs the
[1:26:13.320 --> 1:26:19.400]  executive but everything's backwards the executive runs the legislative and the
[1:26:19.400 --> 1:26:24.360]  feds run the states that is well they got a term for it's you know what
[1:26:24.360 --> 1:26:30.480]  backwards I need your permission for something else can I have permission to

[1:33:39.760 --> 1:33:43.880]  immediately and in the war for all the moron Obama supporters just like the
[1:33:43.880 --> 1:33:47.640]  moron George Bush supporters these guys are all slick lawyers they work for the
[1:33:47.640 --> 1:33:52.840]  very same banks and they lie but they have the fake right wing come out to
[1:33:52.840 --> 1:33:56.560]  tackle Obama I'm going he's not sending enough troops to Afghanistan he's only
[1:33:56.560 --> 1:34:02.080]  increased him by 80,000 oh yeah 40,000 the last six months and then now another
[1:34:02.080 --> 1:34:07.760]  40,000 he's expanded torture expanded secret arrest they're like how dare Obama
[1:34:07.760 --> 1:34:11.000]  allow there be a trial of these terrorists Khalid Sheikh Mohammed Khalid
[1:34:11.000 --> 1:34:15.680]  Sheikh Mohammed they admittedly tortured his children he confessed to bombing

[1:35:08.200 --> 1:35:12.960]  bring an end to this war you can take that to the bank that was October 27th
[1:35:12.960 --> 1:35:16.760]  2007 when he first launched his campaign he gave hundreds of speeches saying that
[1:35:16.760 --> 1:35:21.120]  we cover that in my film fall the Republic the presidency Barack H. Obama
[1:35:21.120 --> 1:35:27.040]  and explain how their tricks operate how their tricks work but but notice notice
[1:35:27.040 --> 1:35:32.000]  that you're thinking well wait he said 16 months that he said 22 now that's how
[1:35:32.000 --> 1:35:38.920]  a liar works for about seven eight months into the from late 2007 in the
[1:35:38.920 --> 1:35:45.040]  mid 2008 he said immediately we could play those clips they're in fall the
[1:35:45.040 --> 1:35:50.320]  Republic you can go pull them up you saw him say it then it was 10 months 16

[1:42:06.000 --> 1:42:10.960]  different genres different strata of culture and what I think you should do
[1:42:10.960 --> 1:42:15.640]  is I think you should have a music video contest across four genres it'd be hip
[1:42:15.640 --> 1:42:22.120]  pop rock and country and techno make each person who does the video on some
[1:42:22.120 --> 1:42:26.720]  subject of the info war nothing about green goblins or alien conspiracies but
[1:42:26.720 --> 1:42:34.200]  straight info war for four genres it'll cross a cultural strata and I'm a music
[1:42:34.200 --> 1:42:38.600]  video producer myself and I'm confident you have hundreds of entries and people
[1:42:38.600 --> 1:42:43.240]  okay Ted that's a great idea Charlie I talked to Charlie sheen multiple times

[1:50:12.280 --> 1:50:15.640]  administration because of the brazen foreign and domestic policies but now
[1:50:15.640 --> 1:50:19.600]  they're all like well if we don't have global government how would be safe from
[1:50:19.600 --> 1:50:22.440]  global war yeah they've gone from denying global government what do you
[1:50:22.440 --> 1:50:24.840]  think about the new head of the EU announcing world government we're gonna
[1:50:24.840 --> 1:50:28.600]  tax you and he says right here global government tax mainstream that's

[1:56:19.160 --> 1:56:22.480]  purposefully hire people that aren't fans because we wanted to see for
[1:56:22.480 --> 1:56:26.320]  themselves sure and I mean I never even you know who we were it was a it was a
[1:56:26.320 --> 1:56:30.360]  credit you put a Craigslist add up when when you were looking didn't say who we

[1:56:34.960 --> 1:56:38.360]  they could put infiltrators in sure but you know hopefully you check my
[1:56:38.360 --> 1:56:42.360]  background no we know you're not infiltrator but but it feels really
[1:56:42.360 --> 1:56:46.360]  good to see this stuff really coming forward you know back in the 90s people
[1:56:46.360 --> 1:56:49.960]  really weren't talking about this it was all it was all about you know Newt
[1:56:49.960 --> 1:56:53.800]  Gingrich and Bill Clinton fighting each other you know all these fake battles and
[1:56:53.800 --> 1:56:56.760]  nobody was looking at the real issues about following the money and where it
[1:56:56.760 --> 1:57:00.360]  goes there were a few people out there but now it's the awakening is really
[1:57:00.360 --> 1:57:04.840]  happening you know just it's it's incremental the world government's here
[1:57:04.840 --> 1:57:08.160]  there's no longer any denial see if we just shut up and then intimidated in a
[1:57:08.160 --> 1:57:10.920]  decade or 20 years ago oh don't talk about the New World Order you're a
[1:57:10.920 --> 1:57:14.480]  kook they would have won but we said no don't call you call me a cook if you

[1:57:25.040 --> 1:57:28.720]  being listened to and just like Hitler and Stalin and Mao these guys are going
