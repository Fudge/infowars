[00:00.000 --> 00:01.400]  You've got it, you've got it.
[00:01.400 --> 00:03.400]  Thank you, space, for coming to you.
[00:07.000 --> 00:09.800]  Waging war on corruption.
[00:09.800 --> 00:11.300]  All right, you guys, go.
[00:11.300 --> 00:14.800]  It's Alex Jones, coming to you live
[00:14.800 --> 00:17.700]  from the front lines of the Info War.
[00:19.700 --> 00:21.400]  Now we see the Earth.
[00:22.300 --> 00:23.300]  You've got it.
[00:25.200 --> 00:27.800]  Now we see the Earth now.
[00:27.800 --> 00:28.800]  You've got it.
[00:30.800 --> 00:31.900]  Now we see the Earth.
[00:31.900 --> 00:33.800]  We are live, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:33.800 --> 00:35.000]  Thank you for joining us.
[00:35.000 --> 00:41.100]  It is Sunday, the 15th day of May, 2011.
[00:41.100 --> 00:43.600]  We're going to be here for the next two hours live
[00:43.600 --> 00:46.700]  as we are every Sunday, 4 to 6 p.m. central.
[00:46.700 --> 00:48.900]  Of course, back weekdays, 11 a.m.
[00:48.900 --> 00:51.500]  to 2 p.m. central standard time.
[00:51.500 --> 00:53.000]  That's 12 noon to 3 p.m.
[00:53.000 --> 00:54.400]  Eastern, obviously.
[00:54.400 --> 00:59.200]  Okay, let me just give you a brief rundown
[00:59.200 --> 01:02.200]  of the important news we have here in front of us today.
[01:02.200 --> 01:05.100]  Obviously, Dominic Strauss-Kahn,
[01:05.100 --> 01:08.500]  big one world government globalist promoter,
[01:08.500 --> 01:10.700]  has been arrested in New York City.
[01:12.700 --> 01:15.300]  And I have no doubt that Khan is the type of guy.
[01:15.300 --> 01:20.300]  He's had some other sex scandal type stuff before.
[01:20.300 --> 01:22.600]  I have no doubt that this is the type of thing
[01:22.600 --> 01:24.900]  that somebody like him would be up to.
[01:24.900 --> 01:27.200]  But Al Gore didn't get in trouble.
[01:27.200 --> 01:31.200]  And the woman says she has the dress like Monica Lewinsky.
[01:31.200 --> 01:32.700]  So why has he been arrested?
[01:32.700 --> 01:35.700]  I mean, in New York City, you can blow up Building 7
[01:35.700 --> 01:36.600]  in the front of everybody.
[01:36.600 --> 01:40.100]  And if the mayor is for it, you don't get in trouble.
[01:40.100 --> 01:43.600]  I mean, in New York City, you can, if you're mafia
[01:43.600 --> 01:45.700]  or globalist mafia, you can do whatever you want.
[01:45.700 --> 01:48.200]  So I find the whole thing very suspicious.
[01:48.200 --> 01:52.900]  We'll be going over some of that today.
[01:52.900 --> 01:54.500]  The head of the IMF has been charged
[01:54.500 --> 01:57.500]  with a criminal sexual act, attempting to rape
[01:57.500 --> 02:00.500]  an unlawful imprisonment following allegations made
[02:00.500 --> 02:02.600]  by a hotel maid in New York City.
[02:05.600 --> 02:07.900]  It'd also be easy to set these guys up.
[02:07.900 --> 02:10.900]  They can, he can be told he's ordering something
[02:10.900 --> 02:15.700]  up to his room and then they send in a regular, regular maid.
[02:15.700 --> 02:17.000]  That's how the globalists operate.
[02:17.000 --> 02:21.000]  You see, Khan was getting ready to run for president
[02:21.000 --> 02:24.600]  against Nicholas Sarkozy, who is a favorite little
[02:24.600 --> 02:26.400]  New World Order minion.
[02:26.400 --> 02:28.400]  And the IMF and World Bank at certain levels
[02:28.400 --> 02:30.600]  do fight with each other.
[02:30.600 --> 02:32.800]  And it was the IMF really pushing for the dollar
[02:32.800 --> 02:35.800]  to implode and die rather than the euro.
[02:35.800 --> 02:40.100]  IMF is generally more associated with the EU
[02:40.100 --> 02:44.200]  and funded mainly by the EU and people by EU minions
[02:44.200 --> 02:48.400]  and the World Bank by US and British minions.
[02:48.400 --> 02:51.100]  But six, one way, half a dozen, another.
[02:51.100 --> 02:55.800]  That's why he should get a trial, a trial.
[02:55.800 --> 02:57.600]  You see, that's why we have trials.
[02:57.600 --> 02:59.800]  That's, we hear the media going, let's get tough
[02:59.800 --> 03:02.200]  and get rid of trials and start torturing people.
[03:02.200 --> 03:05.400]  And that's the way to handle things in America.
[03:05.400 --> 03:08.800]  And that, that, that bin Laden, he doesn't deserve a trial.
[03:08.800 --> 03:11.000]  Really, didn't need to be interrogated either.
[03:11.000 --> 03:12.600]  If he's the terror mastermind, you don't want him
[03:12.600 --> 03:14.900]  to have a trial and have all that information.
[03:14.900 --> 03:17.300]  Who else was involved with him coming out?
[03:17.300 --> 03:22.900]  No, he sleeps with the fishes with his whole CIA history.
[03:22.900 --> 03:23.600]  That's what they tell us.
[03:23.600 --> 03:24.400]  He sleeps with the fishes.
[03:24.400 --> 03:26.400]  He slept with the fishes a long time ago.
[03:26.400 --> 03:29.700]  But there's another example of why you're supposed
[03:29.700 --> 03:32.900]  in a free system should be getting a trial.
[03:32.900 --> 03:35.200]  But trials are out of style.
[03:35.200 --> 03:37.300]  And keeping your public and private pension funds
[03:37.300 --> 03:38.400]  are out of style.
[03:38.400 --> 03:41.500]  There's moves in multiple US states I want to get to later
[03:41.500 --> 03:44.800]  to start looting not just public but private pension funds.
[03:44.800 --> 03:47.600]  The same IMF World Bank system that runs Ireland
[03:47.600 --> 03:51.500]  and our nation is now moving for the private pension funds.
[03:51.500 --> 03:53.500]  Your money, 100%.
[03:53.500 --> 03:55.600]  But I guess that's welfare now.
[03:55.600 --> 03:58.200]  Your own investments, your own bank account,
[03:58.200 --> 04:02.100]  your own pension, if it's private, that's welfare as well.
[04:02.100 --> 04:03.500]  You don't deserve that.
[04:03.500 --> 04:05.500]  Pay your fair share to the bankers
[04:05.500 --> 04:08.900]  because they're busy waging war against the real economy.
[04:08.900 --> 04:11.100]  And I've been lacking in the last week
[04:11.100 --> 04:13.500]  getting into the big developments at Fukushima.
[04:13.500 --> 04:14.900]  So in the spirit of that,
[04:14.900 --> 04:17.300]  I'm going to cover that first when we get back.
[04:17.300 --> 04:21.300]  Then Ron Paul, obviously Friday announcing for president.
[04:21.300 --> 04:25.100]  We told you a year ago that was going to happen and did happen.
[04:25.100 --> 04:27.500]  I'm not going to say what little bird told me,
[04:27.500 --> 04:33.200]  but I knew it was a shoe in as long as he was in good health.
[04:33.200 --> 04:34.600]  And we win either way.
[04:34.600 --> 04:37.200]  He'll be injecting real issues into the campaign,
[04:37.200 --> 04:39.200]  whether he wins, loses or draws.
[04:39.200 --> 04:43.300]  It'll be positioning Ron Paul for runs in the future.
[04:43.300 --> 04:47.800]  My gut tells me Ron Paul is going to be a president someday,
[04:47.800 --> 04:50.100]  perhaps when we've got the Republic back.
[04:50.100 --> 04:52.700]  I'm Alex Jones, Big Sunday Transmission,
[04:52.700 --> 04:54.700]  lined up for you.
[04:54.700 --> 04:58.700]  The revolution will be transmitted via Infowars.com.
[04:58.700 --> 05:02.800]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011,
[05:02.800 --> 05:05.400]  we will witness the most important day in America
[05:05.400 --> 05:06.800]  in more than 50 years.
[05:06.800 --> 05:09.400]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[05:09.400 --> 05:12.100]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children,
[05:12.100 --> 05:14.700]  and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[05:14.700 --> 05:17.800]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[05:17.800 --> 05:20.100]  The crazy part is he's usually right.
[05:20.100 --> 05:22.400]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM,
[05:22.400 --> 05:25.000]  Panny May, Freddie Mac and America's biggest mall owner,
[05:25.000 --> 05:26.300]  General Growth Properties.
[05:26.300 --> 05:29.700]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[05:29.700 --> 05:32.900]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free,
[05:32.900 --> 05:35.500]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet,
[05:35.500 --> 05:37.000]  and it's a real eye-opener.
[05:37.000 --> 05:38.400]  I can't stress this enough.
[05:38.400 --> 05:41.100]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[05:41.100 --> 05:42.700]  He explains everything you need to know,
[05:42.700 --> 05:45.300]  including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[05:45.300 --> 05:49.900]  You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[05:49.900 --> 05:52.500]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.
[05:52.500 --> 05:56.400]  Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[05:56.400 --> 05:58.400]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[05:59.700 --> 06:01.900]  The Genesis Communications Radio Network
[06:01.900 --> 06:07.800]  proudly presents The Alex Jones Show, because there's a war on for your mind.
[06:07.800 --> 06:28.300]  Music
[06:28.300 --> 06:33.800]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. until 2 p.m. Central Standard Time.
[06:33.800 --> 06:38.000]  I'm here live. The websites are infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[06:38.000 --> 06:42.200]  Then, of course, we come back in live Sundays, 4 to 6 p.m. Central.
[06:42.200 --> 06:49.400]  That's 5 to 7 Eastern, 2 to 4 Pacific, 3 to 5 Mountain, and join you live.
[06:49.400 --> 06:54.000]  Appreciate my great crew coming in every Sunday to bring you this transmission.
[06:54.000 --> 06:58.800]  Appreciate all the wonderful AM and FM affiliates out there across the land.
[06:58.800 --> 07:02.700]  We're gaining, on average, about 3 new affiliates a week.
[07:02.700 --> 07:06.600]  Many of them, the number one big talkstations in major cities.
[07:06.600 --> 07:11.000]  And that really illustrates the fact that the information we cover here
[07:11.000 --> 07:14.200]  has been borne out by time.
[07:14.200 --> 07:18.400]  And so much of what we've discussed has unfortunately come true.
[07:18.400 --> 07:23.300]  And so the credibility of this radio broadcast and what we do here is only rising.
[07:23.300 --> 07:26.600]  And we would have had no success if it wasn't for you, the listeners,
[07:26.600 --> 07:31.900]  in the last 16-plus years of transmission continuing to spread the word about this broadcast
[07:31.900 --> 07:37.000]  because you understood how important the information covered here is.
[07:37.000 --> 07:38.800]  Again, I'm Alex Jones, your host.
[07:38.800 --> 07:46.400]  And we're going to be live here now for the next hour and 53 minutes or so.
[07:46.400 --> 07:47.600]  Let me just do this.
[07:47.600 --> 07:50.200]  And I always say I'm going to do this and I almost always fail
[07:50.200 --> 07:54.600]  because I get two or three articles into the stack and then catch on one article
[07:54.600 --> 07:59.600]  and pretty much launch, but I do want to just give you a smattering of what's posted
[07:59.600 --> 08:05.400]  or linked up on our news websites.
[08:05.400 --> 08:10.400]  At Reactor, damage worse than fear, Wall Street Journal,
[08:10.400 --> 08:17.900]  no, the controlled corporate media financed by the nuclear industry to a great extent
[08:17.900 --> 08:23.400]  did not want the public to know how bad this was in the last two months.
[08:23.400 --> 08:26.000]  And so they whitewashed it from the beginning.
[08:26.000 --> 08:29.000]  And we're on record laying that out.
[08:29.000 --> 08:34.600]  All of the six reactors have had fires and explosions.
[08:34.600 --> 08:38.900]  Going back over a month ago, it was clear and we had nuclear physicists and experts
[08:38.900 --> 08:47.600]  and reporters on from Japan that at least three of the six had had almost complete meltdowns.
[08:47.600 --> 08:49.200]  That's now admitted.
[08:49.200 --> 08:55.300]  Five of the six big explosions and fires and even the sixth that was shut down before
[08:55.300 --> 09:01.100]  the tsunami and earthquake that triggered all of this, it's had fires and has been smoking.
[09:01.100 --> 09:08.000]  And the issue is there's continual clouds of radioactive isotopes drifting over the
[09:08.000 --> 09:14.640]  Pacific Ocean directly into North America from California up into Canada and wave after
[09:14.640 --> 09:20.600]  wave comes in and one wave wouldn't be so bad.
[09:20.600 --> 09:25.960]  All the first wave hit, oh, it's only 20 times normal level of this isotope and 30 something
[09:25.960 --> 09:26.960]  of that.
[09:26.960 --> 09:30.480]  And then it's another wave and another wave, months of this stuff drifting over.
[09:30.480 --> 09:34.240]  And the last time I checked, it's not even been on our radar screen myself because the
[09:34.240 --> 09:40.280]  mainstream media started ignoring it and we almost get pulled in a title or gravitational
[09:40.280 --> 09:43.200]  way towards what the mainstream's focusing on.
[09:43.200 --> 09:47.520]  Sometimes we shouldn't because I like to normally when they're covering something to
[09:47.520 --> 09:52.760]  cipher their propaganda and lies, but when they just go silent on it, I tend to at least
[09:52.760 --> 09:55.440]  go partially silent myself.
[09:55.440 --> 09:59.920]  But going back a month ago and when we posted these articles and links to the different
[09:59.920 --> 10:07.000]  state agencies, the feds aren't even looking at radiation levels of 500 plus times in several
[10:07.000 --> 10:12.120]  different key isotopes in the milk, in the produce, all over the US.
[10:12.120 --> 10:16.280]  And now the Japanese government as of two weeks ago was reporting, oh, this might go
[10:16.280 --> 10:20.360]  for nine months, a year, and then it was two years and maybe three years.
[10:20.360 --> 10:27.480]  And now they're saying it may just go forever, I mean, for the foreseeable future decades.
[10:27.480 --> 10:31.040]  And they're saying they're going to cover it with circus tents.
[10:31.040 --> 10:35.840]  And so maybe a PT Barnum can tell us a sucker's born every minute, and I guess this is some
[10:35.840 --> 10:40.360]  attempt to keep the particulate and the gases that are carrying radioactive isotopes from
[10:40.360 --> 10:46.080]  rising up out of giant circus tents and they're contracting with circus tent manufacturers.
[10:46.080 --> 10:49.400]  They make the biggest tents in the world.
[10:49.400 --> 10:53.240]  I guess in the 21st century, they can't build a glass dome over it.
[10:53.240 --> 10:58.480]  And over a mile and a half away, the Japanese were forced to admit about a month ago again,
[10:58.480 --> 11:04.920]  a month into it, that fuel rods had been ejected over a mile and a half.
[11:04.920 --> 11:11.440]  We reported that on the Monday that the reactor three, the Mark I blew up, it's a uranium
[11:11.440 --> 11:12.440]  plutonium reactor.
[11:12.440 --> 11:17.760]  If we could see the rods ejected at least 3,000 feet in the air, I went and looked up
[11:17.760 --> 11:18.760]  the tower height.
[11:18.760 --> 11:22.560]  It was a 1,000-foot tower surrounding it to keep airplanes back.
[11:22.560 --> 11:25.920]  That's Japanese regulations, similar here in the U.S.
[11:25.920 --> 11:30.280]  And then I noticed the explosion was about three times as tall, so I said 3,000 feet.
[11:30.280 --> 11:34.640]  And now, of course, the New York Times reported almost a month ago on the Japanese government
[11:34.640 --> 11:39.040]  reported admitting 4,000-foot plumes, so it was worse than I said, ejecting fuel rods
[11:39.040 --> 11:48.600]  a mile and a half, because they had 644,000 spent fuel rods stored on top of the reactors.
[11:48.600 --> 11:50.680]  That was a very good idea.
[11:50.680 --> 11:57.600]  And so you have what they say is almost complete meltdown at three of the reactors.
[11:57.600 --> 12:00.320]  And so this is now officially dwarf Chernobyl.
[12:00.320 --> 12:02.880]  And I've got all those reports up on infowars.com.
[12:02.880 --> 12:07.720]  I've got My Fox, New York, Wall Street Journal, and a bunch of other reports.
[12:07.720 --> 12:12.600]  Small Joseph Watson's report, media shrugs at Fukushima Nuclear Meltdown and exposed
[12:12.600 --> 12:14.080]  fuel rods.
[12:14.080 --> 12:20.600]  And we noticed on Monday the Japanese TV station, one of the big national stations, had a webcam
[12:20.600 --> 12:25.640]  from a mile away, and we saw smoke and explosions and said, oh, looks like an explosion.
[12:25.640 --> 12:29.640]  But it took four days for our media and the Japanese media to admit there had been more
[12:29.640 --> 12:31.140]  explosions and smoke.
[12:31.140 --> 12:36.000]  So now when the reactors blow up again and again, it's not even news.
[12:36.000 --> 12:40.520]  And we've had reactor leaks in the US, reactor leaks in Canada.
[12:40.520 --> 12:43.440]  Normally would be three-mile island-level events.
[12:43.440 --> 12:45.120]  They're just minor footnotes.
[12:45.120 --> 12:49.720]  And so the effect of this is to condition us to just accept it and think it's no big
[12:49.720 --> 12:51.320]  deal.
[12:51.320 --> 12:52.720]  It's bizarre.
[12:52.720 --> 12:53.720]  And I've heard announcements.
[12:53.720 --> 12:56.600]  They're going to build more reactors in the US now.
[12:56.600 --> 12:59.080]  And Tokyo Electric's going to build them.
[12:59.080 --> 13:03.960]  And this is just the way it is, and that we all just accept it.
[13:03.960 --> 13:04.960]  Oh, oh, oh.
[13:04.960 --> 13:09.840]  But in fact, guys, print me the actual article, because I want to give folks the footnotes.
[13:09.840 --> 13:14.120]  EPA raises safe levels of radiation.
[13:14.120 --> 13:15.840]  And you'll see it out of California newspapers.
[13:15.840 --> 13:18.520]  The San Francisco Chronicle did cover it.
[13:18.520 --> 13:25.640]  But you've got to love this new magic way of handling things, where the establishment
[13:25.640 --> 13:32.840]  just says, oh, we've got 500-plus times safe levels of radioactive nickel, or we've got
[13:32.840 --> 13:39.000]  300-something times radioactive iodine in the Oakland water, and the state admits it,
[13:39.000 --> 13:43.640]  or we've got hundreds and hundreds of times in places like Vermont and the milk.
[13:43.640 --> 13:47.040]  What we're going to do is just raise the isotope level.
[13:47.040 --> 13:49.960]  So in one isotope, they said it could be 1,000 times.
[13:49.960 --> 13:52.720]  In another isotope, they said 150,000 times.
[13:52.720 --> 13:58.280]  And we wrote articles about all this and linked to the state websites and to the public comment
[13:58.280 --> 14:02.320]  period of the Environmental Protection Agency a month ago.
[14:02.320 --> 14:07.120]  And they said, we've changed tentatively the levels that we say are safe, but you can publicly
[14:07.120 --> 14:08.280]  comment if you want.
[14:08.280 --> 14:13.160]  But of course, we could care less what you actually comment on.
[14:13.160 --> 14:14.720]  And that's basically what's happened.
[14:14.720 --> 14:17.280]  So they've now officially raised all those levels.
[14:17.280 --> 14:19.640]  So it's kind of like cyanide.
[14:19.640 --> 14:24.880]  If you get one gram of it, it will kill an average person.
[14:24.880 --> 14:26.840]  Somebody went 150 pounds.
[14:26.840 --> 14:31.640]  Well, if you eat a gram of cyanide, just have the government say, you know what?
[14:31.640 --> 14:34.400]  At least say you can have 1,000 grams.
[14:34.400 --> 14:38.400]  And you put 1,000 grams on your cereal, eat it, you're going to be fine because the government
[14:38.400 --> 14:39.400]  said so.
[14:39.400 --> 14:44.320]  If, you know, Decon Rat poison says, if you eat this, it'll kill you.
[14:44.320 --> 14:48.480]  Well, the government can just wave a magic pixie wand and little pixie dust falls down
[14:48.480 --> 14:51.320]  on it and you can eat 1,000 boxes.
[14:51.320 --> 14:53.920]  Of course, you can't really eat 1,000 boxes.
[14:53.920 --> 14:55.120]  Don't eat one pellet of it.
[14:55.120 --> 14:56.120]  You'll get violently ill.
[14:56.120 --> 14:59.920]  And of course, you can't eat 100 grams of cyanide.
[14:59.920 --> 15:01.160]  It will kill you.
[15:01.160 --> 15:05.440]  But, but see, radiation is invisible.
[15:05.440 --> 15:12.040]  Well, that's not true when it, it was 7.5 million times safe levels.
[15:12.040 --> 15:18.080]  ABC News was finally forced to report a few weeks ago, normal levels at Fukushima show
[15:18.080 --> 15:19.080]  at nighttime.
[15:19.080 --> 15:22.640]  There's big blue beams shooting out of the top.
[15:22.640 --> 15:23.640]  I'm sorry.
[15:23.640 --> 15:26.240]  When it's that powerful, you can see it.
[15:26.240 --> 15:29.560]  But the stuff we're getting hit by, you can't see it.
[15:29.560 --> 15:34.000]  You don't see big glowing beams of radiation shooting through you.
[15:34.000 --> 15:39.240]  Oh, and they are reporting on the death ratcheting up in Japan of people from radiation poisoning.
[15:39.240 --> 15:41.120]  But that's a little footnote now.
[15:41.120 --> 15:42.720]  After all, there's a basketball game on.
[15:42.720 --> 15:45.800]  See, I said I'd just read through the headlines that I didn't.
[15:45.800 --> 15:51.360]  I'm going to come back, get into Dominic Strauss-Kahn of the IMF, reportedly running around like
[15:51.360 --> 15:57.520]  Al Gore, trying to bushwhack women that come into cleanest hotel room and a lot more stay
[15:57.520 --> 16:01.840]  with us.
[16:01.840 --> 16:05.840]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[16:05.840 --> 16:10.680]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into
[16:10.680 --> 16:14.680]  the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[16:14.680 --> 16:19.320]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[16:19.320 --> 16:24.560]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver
[16:24.560 --> 16:30.840]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[16:30.840 --> 16:35.160]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano-silver products, you can now
[16:35.160 --> 16:40.480]  produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[16:40.480 --> 16:45.720]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[16:45.720 --> 16:52.000]  Go to www.silverlungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver
[16:52.000 --> 17:01.520]  Lungs Generator, that's www.silverlungs.com.
[17:01.520 --> 17:05.280]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[17:05.280 --> 17:08.400]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[17:08.400 --> 17:12.760]  As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug from underneath the Americans
[17:12.760 --> 17:13.760]  at home.
[17:13.760 --> 17:18.920]  We have a tremendous influence on our president and Congress and they really are calling the
[17:18.920 --> 17:19.920]  shots.
[17:19.920 --> 17:24.720]  It's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[17:24.720 --> 17:30.200]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation, the criminal offshore cartel
[17:30.200 --> 17:34.800]  held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its ashes constructing world government.
[17:34.800 --> 17:39.360]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, and Arsonists, they're asking for more matches and the Congress is
[17:39.360 --> 17:41.400]  saying, who do we make the checkout to?
[17:41.400 --> 17:46.800]  Today, it seems like nobody does care and right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen
[17:46.800 --> 17:48.640]  a fall of the Republic.
[17:48.640 --> 17:55.200]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com or watch it online right now
[17:55.200 --> 17:59.800]  in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[17:59.800 --> 18:04.440]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[18:04.440 --> 18:08.760]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[18:08.760 --> 18:13.080]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[18:13.080 --> 18:14.400]  allows you to have.
[18:14.400 --> 18:20.120]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[18:20.120 --> 18:24.440]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded and
[18:24.440 --> 18:28.440]  now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[18:28.440 --> 18:31.920]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[18:31.920 --> 18:35.640]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[18:35.640 --> 18:40.400]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[18:40.400 --> 18:44.160]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[18:44.160 --> 18:45.560]  one of my oldest sponsors.
[18:45.560 --> 18:49.800]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[18:49.800 --> 18:51.440]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[18:51.440 --> 18:59.480]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[18:59.480 --> 19:05.040]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will witness the most important
[19:05.040 --> 19:07.760]  day in America in more than 50 years.
[19:07.760 --> 19:10.320]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[19:10.320 --> 19:14.120]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and even how you take care of
[19:14.120 --> 19:15.520]  your health and your own family.
[19:15.520 --> 19:18.720]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[19:18.720 --> 19:21.040]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[19:21.040 --> 19:25.240]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest
[19:25.240 --> 19:27.280]  mall owner, General Growth Properties.
[19:27.280 --> 19:30.600]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[19:30.600 --> 19:34.720]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest
[19:34.720 --> 19:37.920]  and most important prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener.
[19:37.920 --> 19:39.400]  I can't stress this enough.
[19:39.400 --> 19:42.040]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[19:42.040 --> 19:46.280]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[19:46.280 --> 19:50.960]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[19:50.960 --> 19:53.560]  That's End of America, the number three dot com.
[19:53.560 --> 19:57.360]  Watch the free video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[19:57.360 --> 20:00.920]  That's endofamerica3.com.
[20:00.920 --> 20:04.640]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[20:04.640 --> 20:08.040]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[20:08.040 --> 20:11.600]  Network.
[20:11.600 --> 20:17.760]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center and the heart of the Resistance.
[20:17.760 --> 20:25.360]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[20:25.360 --> 20:28.200]  Here's the kind of news I have in front of me.
[20:28.200 --> 20:34.280]  This is out of the Northwest Indiana Times.
[20:34.280 --> 20:40.600]  Court, no right to resist illegal cop entry into home.
[20:40.600 --> 20:45.440]  When I saw this Friday, I went and pulled it up in mainstream newspapers in Indiana.
[20:45.440 --> 20:52.280]  I pulled up the ruling, and it is true, and they have the ruling by the Supreme Court of
[20:52.280 --> 20:54.920]  Indiana saying there is no Fourth Amendment.
[20:54.920 --> 20:58.840]  The police can quote, come in your house even if they don't have a reason.
[20:58.840 --> 21:03.360]  There is no Fourth Amendment in America.
[21:03.360 --> 21:07.000]  Justice Stephen David, writing for the court, said if a police officer wants to enter a
[21:07.000 --> 21:13.520]  home for any reason or no reason at all, they can without warrants known.
[21:13.520 --> 21:18.280]  They went on to attack in the ruling, the Magna Carta and common law is bad.
[21:18.280 --> 21:19.920]  This is not an onion story.
[21:19.920 --> 21:22.360]  This is not a joke.
[21:22.360 --> 21:24.440]  Torture being promoted is not a joke.
[21:24.440 --> 21:30.280]  When the North Koreans tortured our people in the Korean War or when the North Vietnamese
[21:30.280 --> 21:33.800]  did in the Vietnam War, boy, they were the worst.
[21:33.800 --> 21:35.320]  Hitler tortured people after all.
[21:35.320 --> 21:39.560]  The Soviets did, but now our media tells us torture is great.
[21:39.560 --> 21:41.200]  It's the moral thing to do.
[21:41.200 --> 21:47.520]  And my dad went to church today at the Big Methodist Church here in Austin, and they
[21:47.520 --> 21:54.360]  had a little part where at the end of the service, they were reading areas out of the
[21:54.360 --> 21:57.160]  Psalms about the rod and the staff.
[21:57.160 --> 22:01.960]  They comforted me, and they were talking about Christ as the shepherd and the curved staff
[22:01.960 --> 22:07.080]  to help guide the little sheep and help them not go over the cliff, and they called up
[22:07.080 --> 22:15.360]  all the little kids to the front and asked them, you know, what does this mean to you
[22:15.360 --> 22:17.680]  and what does the staff symbolize?
[22:17.680 --> 22:21.720]  And of course, the children were guiding us, protecting us, directing us, and this one
[22:21.720 --> 22:28.960]  little six-year-old said, we can torture the sheep, torture the sheep to keep us safe.
[22:28.960 --> 22:39.160]  And of course, there was a gasp there, but this is how America has changed.
[22:39.160 --> 22:46.000]  And this is what we've become, and we are a captured nation by foreign offshore banks.
[22:46.000 --> 22:50.120]  You know, I get emails all the time saying, well, who are the foreign offshore banks?
[22:50.120 --> 22:56.160]  Well, I've made films breaking it down, the Obama deception, fall the republic in game.
[22:56.160 --> 22:57.600]  It's the six megabanks.
[22:57.600 --> 23:08.960]  If you look at the shareholders of Bank of America, JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo,
[23:08.960 --> 23:14.000]  Citibank, they are predominantly owned by foreign European shareholders.
[23:14.000 --> 23:15.360]  And you can just go review that.
[23:15.360 --> 23:17.080]  That information is public.
[23:17.080 --> 23:24.800]  What was not public for the last three years since the banker takeover of October 3, 2008
[23:24.800 --> 23:30.040]  known as the banker bailout, was not a bailout, it was a robbery, $27 trillion in counting
[23:30.040 --> 23:31.600]  of taxpayer money.
[23:31.600 --> 23:37.320]  What Congress couldn't get, private lawsuits got, because a lot of private people's money
[23:37.320 --> 23:38.320]  was stolen.
[23:38.320 --> 23:42.960]  And of course, AP and Bloomberg in the last year have gotten some of those documents.
[23:42.960 --> 23:48.320]  It's a fraction, only around a trillion of the $27 trillion, and almost all of it was
[23:48.320 --> 23:54.080]  to foreign banks and foreign subsidiaries of those banks.
[23:54.080 --> 23:58.840]  And so that's who runs America, that's who our military works for, that's the states
[23:58.840 --> 24:03.240]  have been pretty much federalized, and these are ruthless people.
[24:03.240 --> 24:07.320]  And that leads me to the next article, a group of articles here.
[24:07.320 --> 24:13.360]  This is out of Sky Television, that's Fox in England, IMF head charged over alleged sex
[24:13.360 --> 24:15.760]  attack.
[24:15.760 --> 24:19.280]  And remember Al Gore, the woman even says she has the dress, where he ran around with
[24:19.280 --> 24:24.800]  an open robe on, I can imagine nothing more disgusting than Al Gore running around with
[24:24.800 --> 24:33.680]  a robe open, with no underwear on, and cornered her, and then basically, well, you've seen
[24:33.680 --> 24:36.720]  what dogs do when they start jumping on each other.
[24:36.720 --> 24:39.880]  And the police just said, well, we don't care if you have the DNA, we're not testing,
[24:39.880 --> 24:42.360]  and he's Al Gore.
[24:42.360 --> 24:48.760]  And Khan, we have some articles linked, you know, and of course Al Gore says he hasn't
[24:48.760 --> 24:49.760]  done it.
[24:49.760 --> 24:53.000]  And I'm sure he did, and Al Gore is a great, great American, very truthful person.
[24:53.000 --> 24:58.960]  After all, he invented the Internet in 1996, he said decades after it was publicly invented
[24:58.960 --> 25:05.800]  and the inventors are known in the U.S. and England, but he said it, so it's true.
[25:05.800 --> 25:12.520]  Continuing IMF head charged over alleged sex attack.
[25:12.520 --> 25:19.120]  And this does fit into the MO of Dominique Strauss-Khan, he's had marital problems and
[25:19.120 --> 25:23.960]  problems reportedly with his employees and almost lost his job a few years ago.
[25:23.960 --> 25:26.360]  We have that linked up on infowars.com.
[25:26.360 --> 25:29.840]  In fact, let me just take you to it.
[25:29.840 --> 25:36.040]  As a reminder, back in 2008, the IMF hired a law firm to investigate whether its chief
[25:36.040 --> 25:40.400]  had improper relationship with a female employee, and it's got the name of her and a link to
[25:40.400 --> 25:41.400]  it.
[25:41.400 --> 25:47.360]  We've got Tyler Durgan at Zero Hedge, we've got that posted up at infowars.com.
[25:47.360 --> 25:50.000]  But here's the Sky television report.
[25:50.000 --> 25:54.040]  IMF had charged over alleged sex attack.
[25:54.040 --> 25:59.240]  The head of the IMF has been charged with a criminal sexual act, attempted rape, an
[25:59.240 --> 26:04.520]  unlawful imprisonment, following allegations made by a hotel made in New York.
[26:04.520 --> 26:10.720]  But Bill Clinton said, how dare you, how dare you say I had sex with that woman Monica
[26:10.720 --> 26:17.080]  Lewinsky, I did not have sex, look at me in my eyes, I did not have sex with her.
[26:17.080 --> 26:21.720]  Of course, it came out later, he did and lied and perjured himself, but he's still innocent,
[26:21.720 --> 26:22.720]  he's a good American.
[26:22.720 --> 26:27.000]  IMF had charged over alleged sex attack.
[26:27.000 --> 26:32.880]  Dominique Strauss-Khan, who was a horrible, swollen, globalist who openly waged war against
[26:32.880 --> 26:38.600]  Greece and Ireland, and it's turned out in both those countries that over 90% of the
[26:38.600 --> 26:44.800]  debt is owed by the private banks that use the IMF as a consortium, less than 10% in
[26:44.800 --> 26:49.320]  Iceland as well, it's the same in every country, it's owed by the people, but they buy off
[26:49.320 --> 26:54.600]  the prime ministers, the presidents, the heads of the private central banks, and I remember
[26:54.600 --> 26:58.840]  seeing the head of the Irish central bank a few months ago in the BBC saying, we believe
[26:58.840 --> 27:01.840]  it's good to be owned by foreign banks, we're glad to be taken over.
[27:01.840 --> 27:06.400]  See, they just throw it in your face and say it with a straight face as if you'll just
[27:06.400 --> 27:07.400]  accept it.
[27:07.400 --> 27:11.000]  Yeah, the TSAs just stick their hands down your pants, yeah, we're going to take the
[27:11.000 --> 27:15.320]  veterans' death benefits from World War II onward and start making vets pay for their
[27:15.320 --> 27:21.760]  own health care, yeah, we're going to take their life insurance, remember that came out
[27:21.760 --> 27:25.960]  a year ago, nobody got in trouble, secret deals with the Pentagon, with insurance companies
[27:25.960 --> 27:35.240]  to steal all their money, I mean, yeah, we're going to give thousands of waivers to Al Gore
[27:35.240 --> 27:42.320]  and Bill Clinton and George Soros' buddies through President Obama with these waivers
[27:42.320 --> 27:45.840]  for health care, where your company, if you're an insider, doesn't have to buy health care,
[27:45.840 --> 27:49.800]  but your competition does, but I digress, it's all in your face.
[27:49.800 --> 27:55.800]  IMF head charged over alleged sex attack.
[27:55.800 --> 27:59.400]  Dominique Strauss-Kahn was taken into custody at JFK airport after being pulled from the
[27:59.400 --> 28:04.800]  first class cabin of a flight to Paris just minutes before takeoff, a 62-year-old married
[28:04.800 --> 28:09.720]  father of four is due to appear before a judge later today, the lawyer representing Mr. Strauss-Kahn,
[28:09.720 --> 28:15.120]  Benjamin Rothman, has indicated he will plead not guilty to the charges, the incident is
[28:15.120 --> 28:22.680]  alleged to have happened in Mr. Strauss-Kahn's luxury suite at the Sofitel Hotel not far
[28:22.680 --> 28:27.640]  from Manhattan's Times Square, a 32-year-old maid told authorities she was attacked when
[28:27.640 --> 28:35.640]  she went to the room to clean it, Kahn's lawyer is now denying it, but I want to tell you
[28:35.640 --> 28:42.920]  what Ron Paul says about this when we come back from this quick break, and then I'm
[28:42.920 --> 28:49.280]  going to shift gears into Geithner, our little Strauss-Kahn, head of the Treasury, Geithner

[31:59.600 --> 32:04.240]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[32:04.240 --> 32:09.200]  1. New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[32:09.200 --> 32:13.360]  2. Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you
[32:13.360 --> 32:18.840]  to have. It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology
[32:18.840 --> 32:19.840]  is coming.
[32:19.840 --> 32:24.800]  3. In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded. And now, new
[32:24.800 --> 32:28.320]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[32:28.320 --> 32:33.120]  4. Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids. Every year, thousands of families
[32:33.120 --> 32:35.120]  lose their power from weather-related onages.
[32:35.120 --> 32:40.480]  5. A solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind. Folks,
[32:40.480 --> 32:44.080]  I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of
[32:44.080 --> 32:51.320]  my oldest sponsors. You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com. That's mysolarbackup.com.

[33:01.400 --> 33:08.400]  On the coast, direct from Austin. You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[33:31.400 --> 33:39.280]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, here's the toll-free number. If you want to get involved on air
[33:39.280 --> 33:44.320]  on any of the news items or issues that have already covered or any questions or points
[33:44.320 --> 33:48.400]  or issues you want to raise, I'd love to hear from you. The Sunday number is different
[33:48.400 --> 34:03.800]  than the weekday number. It's 877-789-ALEX or 877-789-2539. And we will get you up and
[34:03.800 --> 34:06.320]  on the air. Okay, let me just get back into this whole
[34:06.320 --> 34:12.120]  Strauss con thing. Then I want to get into Israel, reportedly shooting and killing eight
[34:12.120 --> 34:19.120]  people in riots and uprisings going on in Israel and on Israel's borders. Obviously,
[34:19.120 --> 34:25.440]  I'm going to ask the question, when does the NATO invasion of Israel begin? Because we've
[34:25.440 --> 34:31.680]  been told that if a government shoots rioters, they must be invaded. Even if the rioters are
[34:31.680 --> 34:40.120]  admitted al-Qaeda as they are in Libya. Now, come on, let's be consistent here. Are we
[34:40.120 --> 34:45.560]  going to have a NATO bombardment of Bahrain? Are we going to have a NATO bombardment of
[34:45.560 --> 34:50.200]  Saudi Arabia? We've had some riots there. And some deaths? Are we going to have – no,
[34:50.200 --> 34:55.280]  no, there's not going to be any of that there. It's not humanitarian what's happening
[34:55.280 --> 34:59.800]  in Libya. I'm no fan of Muammar Qaddafi. But you notice he's tried to play nice for
[34:59.800 --> 35:05.560]  six years, paid reparations, gave up his WMDs, and now he's been double-crossed, and they
[35:05.560 --> 35:11.720]  admit the group trying to overthrow him is al-Qaeda-based. That is amazing. In fact,
[35:11.720 --> 35:16.680]  there's more mainstream news this week even admitting that, well, this is good al-Qaeda,
[35:16.680 --> 35:20.880]  even though the leader of the rebels is a guy who fought U.S. troops in Iraq. That's
[35:20.880 --> 35:28.680]  on record. And we're told we have to because Qaddafi might have killed some protesters.
[35:28.680 --> 35:33.220]  It turned out most of that wasn't true. And he didn't flee, like they said, to Venezuela.
[35:33.220 --> 35:39.840]  My point is we're being lied to. Just like our media says, it's illegal to try to assassinate
[35:39.840 --> 35:45.840]  ahead of state. And so we are not trying to assassinate Qaddafi. Every time he gives a
[35:45.840 --> 35:51.360]  TV interview, the facility he's at gets bombed within 20 minutes. The minute he goes on
[35:51.360 --> 35:56.680]  TV live, jets are launched to go bomb whatever compound he's in. They're killing a whole
[35:56.680 --> 36:03.480]  bunch of his family, and folks are like, whoo-hoo, USA, USA. It has nothing to do with USA.
[36:03.480 --> 36:08.080]  Its oil companies want the trillions in oil, period. And they'll use whoever they need
[36:08.080 --> 36:11.800]  to to get control of it. And they're like, well, I locked Donald Trump. Give us their
[36:11.800 --> 36:18.040]  oil. You pay for the war. You don't get the oil, dum-dum. You've figured that out yet?
[36:18.040 --> 36:23.120]  The globalists don't care about Libyans or Iraqis or Germans or Americans or Israelis
[36:23.120 --> 36:29.560]  or anybody. They don't care about Japanese glowing from radiation. They care about dominating
[36:29.560 --> 36:35.600]  society. They care about control. Okay, I'm ranting. I'm ranting. Now, on this whole
[36:35.600 --> 36:43.040]  Dominic Strauss con, I don't like him. He's got a history of reportedly liking the ladies.
[36:43.040 --> 36:48.200]  This is a classic trait of people like Bill Clinton and where there's smoke, there's fire
[36:48.200 --> 36:52.840]  with Bill Clinton. I mean, how many women went to court, swore affidavits that he raped
[36:52.840 --> 36:58.680]  them, that he would hold them down and bite their face to hold them down? I mean, vicious
[36:58.680 --> 37:06.600]  stuff. How many reports of Al Gore? How many reports of these politicians and people acting
[37:06.600 --> 37:12.560]  like thugs? Is it true? The cops won't test the woman's dress in Al Gore's case, so we
[37:12.560 --> 37:17.920]  won't find out. But she's saying, here's the dress I swear under penalty of perjury.
[37:17.920 --> 37:24.520]  Test the dress, test the dress. And they're like, no, no, no. So why then did Conn reportedly
[37:24.520 --> 37:31.560]  force oral sex is what the police are saying is the report on this woman in the suite,
[37:31.560 --> 37:36.800]  then run off and jump on the jet to France. And before it could take off, he got pulled
[37:36.800 --> 37:43.520]  off. Why whenever some other elitist like Al Gore or Bill Clinton is reportedly doing
[37:43.520 --> 37:50.120]  similar things, does nothing happen? What's happening with Conn? I mean, ladies and gentlemen,
[37:50.120 --> 37:55.600]  if you haven't studied the UN in New York City, they've been caught many, many times.
[37:55.600 --> 38:00.360]  But only when it's so egregious and a local cop has probable cause because they hear the
[38:00.360 --> 38:04.680]  person screaming from a balcony and the cops don't need a warrant and they bust in because
[38:04.680 --> 38:10.200]  if the cops have to get a warrant and they go to the corrupt New York establishment,
[38:10.200 --> 38:16.240]  the judges won't issue them on the UN. How many times you see the headline, UN diplomats
[38:16.240 --> 38:21.320]  caught running slaves, white slaves. People send me emails going, well, are black slaves
[38:21.320 --> 38:25.400]  worth as much as white slaves? Folks, I'm not talking about black people and white people.
[38:25.400 --> 38:31.680]  If you're a new listener, white slavery is a sex slave. They could be green, black, white,
[38:31.680 --> 38:39.680]  okay, sex slaves, white slavery. They catch him just constantly from China, Mexico, Sudan,
[38:39.680 --> 38:45.640]  Saudi Arabia. In fact, folks won't believe it. Well, most people probably heard it in
[38:45.640 --> 38:53.960]  the news, but just search UN diplomat caught trafficking drugs or UN diplomats or diplomats
[38:53.960 --> 39:00.880]  caught with slaves. Just type in diplomats, slaves, diplomats, sex slaves. I mean, I see
[39:00.880 --> 39:07.200]  it every week without looking. And guess what an IMF or World Bank executive or even mid-level
[39:07.200 --> 39:14.560]  minion has. They have diplomatic immunity under the UN and under the EU. And they, they don't,
[39:14.560 --> 39:20.840]  they cannot be pulled over by the Texas state police or the New York state police. I mean,
[39:20.840 --> 39:26.680]  there have been cases of them running stop signs, running over bikes, running into people.
[39:26.680 --> 39:31.960]  Houston police gets sick of it, pull them over, arrest them. Oh, that cop was so fired,
[39:31.960 --> 39:42.160]  he'll make your head spin. But little old Alex Jones. Oh yeah. We're all held to the
[39:42.160 --> 39:47.520]  law. They are not held to the law. And that's what globalism is. These globalists, these
[39:47.520 --> 39:52.760]  private megabanks created the UN, created all these organizations. They go lobby our
[39:52.760 --> 39:56.920]  Congress, lobby our parliaments in Canada and England and other areas and get those
[39:56.920 --> 40:03.520]  governments to sign treaties with the private IMF World Bank World Trade Organization, UN
[40:03.520 --> 40:09.280]  to waive our rights to them and to pay our tax money to them. That's what the new world
[40:09.280 --> 40:13.200]  order is. That's why they've now announced, oh, there's a global banking problem, a global
[40:13.200 --> 40:18.920]  currency crash. We'll set up a new global bank owned by the private IMF and World Bank
[40:18.920 --> 40:25.880]  and its shareholders. They're just a consortium for the big private banks, a holding company.
[40:25.880 --> 40:31.520]  And we will now have total control over all currency, all taxes worldwide, all interest
[40:31.520 --> 40:36.720]  rates. That's the new world order. Not so much the governing class or the government
[40:36.720 --> 40:43.280]  class. That's the corrupt minions, but this private corporate class that again, most corporations,
[40:43.280 --> 40:47.440]  big corporations are bigger than the average nation. They have their own intelligence agencies,
[40:47.440 --> 40:53.080]  their own systems. Most U.S. intelligence is run by multinational private companies now.
[40:53.080 --> 40:57.680]  That's how they get away with this stuff. It isn't even our government that stage 9-11.
[40:57.680 --> 41:03.280]  It was these private contractor networks that control our government that staged it. That's
[41:03.280 --> 41:10.160]  what the evidence and deep research shows. Now continuing, this is how these diplomats
[41:10.160 --> 41:14.800]  act. This is the type of stuff they constantly engage in. And by the way, do we find any
[41:14.800 --> 41:19.960]  articles about UN diplomats, sex slaves? Because I want to put those on screen. We did. Okay,
[41:19.960 --> 41:23.160]  good. We're going to, during the breaks, I'll dig some of those up. We'll dig some
[41:23.160 --> 41:29.840]  of those up and I will read those headlines to you. But it is an ongoing situation. So
[41:29.840 --> 41:36.480]  when I see this happening with Dominique Strauss-Kahn, I tend to give it credibility, but he deserves
[41:36.480 --> 41:42.520]  a trial. That's why we have trials in this country. You just can't kill somebody, throw
[41:42.520 --> 41:47.560]  them in the ocean and then say they did what you said they'd done because you said so.
[41:47.560 --> 41:55.000]  And that's the larger issue here. Why do we, in the U.S. especially, just take whatever
[41:55.000 --> 41:59.360]  the corporate media puts out as the truth? And why does the big corporate media take
[41:59.360 --> 42:04.920]  what the politicians say in press conferences as true and then just repeat it to everyone?
[42:04.920 --> 42:08.200]  That's why we've gotten in so much trouble. Now that said, I don't know if Kahn did this
[42:08.200 --> 42:17.320]  or not. It fits the psychological type, if you have to profile these people. But at
[42:17.320 --> 42:24.560]  the same time, his lawyer says IMF chief denies New York City sexual assault charges. Now
[42:24.560 --> 42:28.920]  continuing, there's a lot of intelligence operations, a lot of governments working against
[42:28.920 --> 42:34.000]  each other. He may have thought he was ordering up a prostitute and this happened, or he may
[42:34.000 --> 42:40.920]  have been set up. That's why he gets a trial. But here's another issue. IMF chief's arrest
[42:40.920 --> 42:47.600]  rose French. Politics in a disarray, New York Times, he was set in favor to beat Nicholas
[42:47.600 --> 42:56.680]  Sarkozy and he's not seen as pro U.S. or Anglo-American establishment as Sarkozy. That's why there
[42:56.680 --> 42:58.680]  could be a motive here to set him up.

[44:01.480 --> 44:06.000]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone. This is our last
[44:06.000 --> 44:11.520]  chance to not relive history. As we're finishing off this agenda, they'll be pulling the rug
[44:11.520 --> 44:16.320]  from underneath the Americans at home. I've turned a tremendous influence on our president
[44:16.320 --> 44:21.560]  in Congress and they really are calling the shots. I think it's incumbent upon all of
[44:21.560 --> 44:27.200]  us as American citizens to pay attention. For the Republic identifies the enemies of
[44:27.200 --> 44:32.800]  our nation, the criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty and on its
[44:32.800 --> 44:37.280]  ashes constructing world government. Tim Geithner, Bernanke, the arsonists, they're
[44:37.280 --> 44:41.400]  asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[44:41.400 --> 44:47.280]  Today seems like nobody does care. And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall
[44:47.280 --> 44:53.520]  of the Republic. Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com. We're

[45:00.160 --> 45:04.440]  After the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies
[45:04.440 --> 45:09.560]  and disasters in unprecedented numbers. People have had to literally run for their lives.
[45:09.560 --> 45:14.080]  Folks, this is Steve Shank with E-Foods Direct. I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster
[45:14.080 --> 45:18.880]  strikes, you won't have time to think. You must act automatically. What does the pilot
[45:18.880 --> 45:23.960]  do when the helicopter engine fails in flight? No time to think. Just act automatically.
[45:23.960 --> 45:28.920]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds or the knock comes on your door, you'll need
[45:28.920 --> 45:33.800]  to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need. You need a five day
[45:33.800 --> 45:39.040]  extreme emergency kit. With serious supplies and real food to secure to adults for five
[45:39.040 --> 45:46.520]  days, this powerful $300 extreme emergency kit is free with an order of at least $995
[45:46.520 --> 46:02.360]  from E-Foods Direct. Go to E-FoodsDirect.com slash Alex or call 800-409-5633. That's E-FoodsDirect.com
[46:02.360 --> 46:03.880]  slash Alex 800-409-5633. A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011, we will
[46:03.880 --> 46:08.760]  witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years. He says it will change
[46:08.760 --> 46:13.160]  everything about our lives. The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children and
[46:13.160 --> 46:16.760]  even how you take care of your health and your own family. Now, this man has made some
[46:16.760 --> 46:21.560]  outrageous predictions over the years. The crazy part is, he's usually right. You see,
[46:21.560 --> 46:25.800]  he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac, and America's biggest mall owner
[46:25.800 --> 46:31.240]  General Growth Properties. In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy. Recently,
[46:31.240 --> 46:35.440]  he created a video which you can watch online for free, detailing his biggest and most important
[46:35.440 --> 46:39.720]  prediction yet, and it's a real eye-opener. I can't stress this enough. You should at
[46:39.720 --> 46:44.000]  least watch this free video online today. He explains everything you need to know, including
[46:44.000 --> 46:51.000]  simple steps you can take to protect yourself. You can find the video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[46:51.000 --> 46:57.320]  That's End of America, the number 3.com. Watch the free video at www.EndOfAmerica3.com.
[46:57.320 --> 47:10.320]  That's EndOfAmerica3.com.
[47:10.320 --> 47:29.880]  We've found literally hundreds and hundreds of articles dealing with U.N. sex crimes all
[47:29.880 --> 47:36.760]  over the world, using a diplomatic immunity to traffic and children, women, you name it,
[47:36.760 --> 47:41.560]  police, here in the United States, caught routinely using their diplomatic pouches to
[47:41.560 --> 47:48.480]  bring in narcotics, running slaves, you can just type in U.N. diplomats, drug trafficking,
[47:48.480 --> 47:53.640]  you can type in U.N. peacekeepers, abusing children into Google and find it. Here's one,
[47:53.640 --> 48:01.920]  peacekeepers abusing children, BBC, here's another one, U.N. child sex slave scandals continue,
[48:01.920 --> 48:07.560]  here's a CNN charity, aid workers raping abusing children, then you read the article, it's
[48:07.560 --> 48:15.040]  U.N. people. So that's my point, is that these globalists have diplomatic immunity,
[48:15.040 --> 48:19.800]  and these IMF and World Bank heads have diplomatic immunity, and high level State Department
[48:19.800 --> 48:27.320]  officials have it, when they're in other countries, and they can basically get away with murder,
[48:27.320 --> 48:34.080]  and that's wrong, and so it's setting up a new imperial global system for these bureaucrats,
[48:34.080 --> 48:39.240]  and these corporate bureaucrats are above the law, and so that was my point with Dominic
[48:39.240 --> 48:44.480]  Strauss-Kahn, they're normally above the law, and I know that he had diplomatic immunity
[48:44.480 --> 48:53.000]  in his IMF position, so it's very unusual that the New York police would arrest him,
[48:53.000 --> 48:59.440]  and he may well have done it too, this does not follow the normal pattern, but hey, that's
[48:59.440 --> 49:03.840]  good news for Nicholas Arcozzi, because the polls were showing that he was probably going
[49:03.840 --> 49:10.360]  to lose the Dominic Strauss-Kahn, not anymore, whatever happens with this case, now this
[49:10.360 --> 49:16.600]  is out of the national journal, Geithner predicts double dip if Congress fails to lift debt
[49:16.600 --> 49:24.000]  ceiling, well you know, the White House told us last year that we left the recession in
[49:24.000 --> 49:34.920]  June of 2009, almost two years ago, so we, is that longer than two years ago, so we left
[49:34.920 --> 49:41.680]  the recession, everything's wonderful, and they tell us unemployment's 9.0%, so it's
[49:41.680 --> 49:46.600]  less than 10%, but even 60 minutes did a study in November of last year, and said it was
[49:46.600 --> 49:53.640]  over 22, and all these prestigious financial institutions that study it say, it's between
[49:53.640 --> 50:01.560]  22 and 24, California's above 33, but Geithner tells us that inflation's low, everybody knows
[50:01.560 --> 50:05.480]  inflation's up, look at the price of everything going up, look at the price of fuel going
[50:05.480 --> 50:10.200]  up, only thing going down is housing, because of that bubble popping, so they're using
[50:10.200 --> 50:16.200]  that number to try to hold the inflation numbers down, and if the price of beef goes up, then
[50:16.200 --> 50:20.280]  they'll substitute it with pork or whatever's lower and say, well that's what you're going
[50:20.280 --> 50:27.960]  to be eating, they've got a lot of different ways to manipulate the different indexes,
[50:27.960 --> 50:35.760]  but it's just so asinine that everything that comes out of their mouth is an easily verifiable
[50:35.760 --> 50:43.800]  rock of bologna, and Geithner is saying that if we don't raise the debt ceiling, it will
[50:43.800 --> 50:48.160]  cause a double debt recession, and of course he said three weeks ago that if we didn't
[50:48.160 --> 50:53.200]  raise the debt ceiling, it would cause a depression and a default on the debt, well the private
[50:53.200 --> 51:03.160]  Federal Reserve is already technically defaulting on the debt, because they're already buying
[51:03.160 --> 51:09.480]  over 70% of the T-bills that go to auction, the Federal Reserve is buying those, and then
[51:09.480 --> 51:14.040]  American taxpayers then have to pay the Federal Reserve for it, so we the American people
[51:14.040 --> 51:18.640]  are going into debt, and then the private Federal Reserve group of banks, they make
[51:18.640 --> 51:24.600]  profits off of servicing the interest rate on that debt, and they get to loan it out
[51:24.600 --> 51:31.960]  at 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, some annual credit card rates are at 79.9, don't believe me,
[51:31.960 --> 51:37.920]  just put credit card rates now as high as 79.9, you'll get CNN Associated Press, in fact
[51:37.920 --> 51:43.760]  let's just show them again, let's just hit them with it right now, let's just show the
[51:43.760 --> 51:48.840]  radio listeners send me emails and say, show us, are you crazy, it's radio, I forget, we're
[51:48.840 --> 52:00.360]  simulcasting and streaming video with a multi-cam shoot at prisonplanet.tv, prisonplanet.tv,
[52:00.360 --> 52:04.960]  15 cents a day, $5.95 a month, that pays for the bandwidth, a whole other dimension to
[52:04.960 --> 52:10.880]  the radio show, all my films, my book, Paul Watson's book is eBooks, expanded extras,
[52:10.880 --> 52:16.360]  like the Hour Plus interview with Stuart Rhodes and others in our new studio, it's called
[52:16.360 --> 52:22.080]  the State Stripe Back, newest video up there, prisonplanet.tv, and your support makes this
[52:22.080 --> 52:30.120]  transmission possible, but to have Geithner, to have Geithner running around after the private
[52:30.120 --> 52:35.320]  central banks have put us in this position by design, that's in the IMF World Bank documents
[52:35.320 --> 52:41.160]  that got leaked in 2002, BBC reported on it, they want us in debt, they get the interest
[52:41.160 --> 52:46.080]  on the debt that they positioned us into, the vast majority of the debt was money they
[52:46.080 --> 52:53.240]  created that they used, but we've got to pay them for the money that we gave them, and
[52:53.240 --> 52:58.680]  he's saying, oh my gosh, another recession may come if you don't do what we say, but
[52:58.680 --> 53:03.320]  Standard and Poor's a month ago said that the outlook for the US keeping its triple
[53:03.320 --> 53:09.840]  A rating is poor, and many institutions have come out of that rate and say we really should
[53:09.840 --> 53:15.520]  be more like a C, they want to position us to lose our credit rating like a third world
[53:15.520 --> 53:20.360]  country, so instead of the government getting credit from these bankers out of nothing,
[53:20.360 --> 53:25.800]  at 1% or 2%, which is still a lot when you're talking about tens of trillions of dollars,
[53:25.800 --> 53:31.080]  now it can be 10, 20, 30% like Nigeria or Argentina, there's a reason those third world
[53:31.080 --> 53:35.800]  countries can never get up on their feet, the endemic corruption but also the debt system
[53:35.800 --> 53:41.720]  to the IMF and World Bank run by people like Dominique Strauss-Kahn now in a jail cell in
[53:41.720 --> 53:50.680]  New York, so if we don't go into more debt, we're going to lose our rating, but we're
[53:50.680 --> 53:56.800]  losing our rating because, Standard and Poor said, our debt is unserviceable and too big,
[53:56.800 --> 54:02.280]  so instead of fixing the debt, they say more debt is the answer, now the crew was just
[54:02.280 --> 54:08.120]  showing me an article and I'm glad that they reminded me by putting it up on screen, against
[54:08.120 --> 54:12.760]  raising the debt ceiling, then you're with Al Qaeda, remember this a month ago or three
[54:12.760 --> 54:21.760]  weeks ago, Bush, former Treasury Secretary, Paul O'Neill, in a cryptic statement says,
[54:21.760 --> 54:26.720]  this is going to cause our economy to implode, if we don't raise the debt ceiling, we don't
[54:26.720 --> 54:30.400]  have to raise the debt ceiling if you cut government and if you make Wall Street take
[54:30.400 --> 54:35.760]  a haircut and not pay them these trillions in bonuses based on derivative fraud they
[54:35.760 --> 54:42.040]  created that they then bought off Congress and threatened Congress with imploding economy
[54:42.040 --> 54:48.040]  back in October 2008 if they didn't put unlimited money into the kitty with too big to fail,
[54:48.040 --> 54:52.320]  see how they create the Ponzi scheme, hold us hostage and say put unlimited money into
[54:52.320 --> 54:57.440]  it or we're going to take the ship down with us, well they're already taking the ship down
[54:57.440 --> 55:04.560]  with them and they are becoming trillionaires in the process, these major corporations,
[55:04.560 --> 55:08.040]  look at who's making record profits, look at who's making record bonuses, it's the
[55:08.040 --> 55:12.320]  big mega banks, it's the big shareholders in the private cell reserve, well everything
[55:12.320 --> 55:16.840]  else is destroyed, well our futures destroyed, they're not free market, these are crony
[55:16.840 --> 55:21.360]  capitalists, they're insider manipulators, they're monopoly men and in case you don't
[55:21.360 --> 55:25.240]  believe that clip here it is from Bloomberg, he went on to say we need to round up members
[55:25.240 --> 55:30.520]  of Congress who are the crazy Al Qaeda people that don't want to give him the bankers and
[55:30.520 --> 55:37.120]  his crew unlimited money, here he is throwing a tantrum saying that if you are against increasing
[55:37.120 --> 55:42.160]  the debt and going more into debt to them, these parasites that you are Al Qaeda and
[55:42.160 --> 55:44.920]  need to be rounded up, here it is.
[55:44.920 --> 55:52.480]  In this sense there is now a set of practices that are employed that are effectively accounting
[55:52.480 --> 55:58.560]  engineering to extend reaching the debt ceiling, so Tim Geithner has said we're going to reach
[55:58.560 --> 56:05.440]  the debt ceiling on May the 18th and he hopes that the Congress will act by July, how do
[56:05.440 --> 56:15.200]  we get from May to July by doing financial accounting tricks, I think it helps the Congress
[56:15.200 --> 56:18.560]  to avoid being responsible, I think that's a really bad idea.
[56:18.560 --> 56:20.360]  It's a poor political judgment.
[56:20.360 --> 56:24.800]  Absolutely, I wish Tim Geithner would say when we reach the debt ceiling, we're not
[56:24.800 --> 56:29.360]  going to do tricks down here at our end of Pennsylvania Avenue, the Congress needs to
[56:29.360 --> 56:34.520]  be responsible and adult and take action on the debt ceiling and I think the people
[56:34.520 --> 56:40.800]  who are threatening not to pass the debt ceiling are our version of Al Qaeda terrorists, they're
[56:40.800 --> 56:47.760]  really putting our whole society at risk by threatening to round up 50% of the members
[56:47.760 --> 56:51.360]  of the Congress who are loony who would put our credit at risk.
[56:51.360 --> 56:54.920]  So Bain are not ruling out that any kind of debate.
[56:54.920 --> 56:58.560]  Now I played that like three or four times in a row a few weeks ago to really get the
[56:58.560 --> 57:03.800]  gist of it but he's saying they're threatening to make us round up half of Congress who are
[57:03.800 --> 57:09.200]  the loony Al Qaeda, what a bizarre statement but remember what the guy that followed him
[57:09.200 --> 57:14.840]  Henry Paulson said in early October he went to Congress and he said we're going to have
[57:14.840 --> 57:18.040]  martial law if you don't do this, then he went out on TV and said we're going to have
[57:18.040 --> 57:23.280]  a depression, you've got to give us unlimited money in a blank check.
[57:23.280 --> 57:27.720]  The market dropped almost a thousand points the next day and Congress that wouldn't give
[57:27.720 --> 57:32.200]  them the $27 trillion they've now stolen gave them the blank check and then they wouldn't
[57:32.200 --> 57:37.040]  tell Congress where the money went and later we found out it went to buy off MSNBC, put
[57:37.040 --> 57:42.640]  on anti-American propaganda, it went to almost exclusively foreign banks that have hijacked
[57:42.640 --> 57:44.360]  this country, okay?
[57:44.360 --> 57:51.320]  People like Dominique Strauss-Kahn, stay with us.
[57:51.320 --> 57:56.160]  Hi folks this is Alex Jones, I'm looking for people that have the wisdom to spot savings,
[57:56.160 --> 57:58.640]  opportunity and recognized risk.

[58:22.560 --> 58:24.960]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.

[58:50.800 --> 58:54.960]  You've heard Alex explain how the Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[58:54.960 --> 58:59.680]  with your self produced colloidal silver solutions, yet many are unaware of the entire function
[58:59.680 --> 59:03.520]  of the Silver Lungs System and how it has been designed to deliver your silver solutions
[59:03.520 --> 59:06.200]  anywhere in or on the body.
[59:06.200 --> 59:10.960]  My name is Mario Safaldi and I'm the developer of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[59:10.960 --> 59:15.560]  Not only does the Silver Lungs System produce endless colloidal and ionic silver solutions,
[59:15.560 --> 59:20.760]  it also comes equipped with the proper applicators and devices needed to deliver your silver solutions
[59:20.760 --> 59:23.720]  directly to key target areas.
[59:23.720 --> 59:31.600]  This includes the eyes, ears, nose, lungs, topically to the skin and orally for the digestive system.
[59:31.600 --> 59:38.840]  Be sure to watch our new 7 minute video tour of the Silver Lungs System at www.silverlungs.com
[59:38.840 --> 59:41.960]  to learn more about how the Silver Lungs System works.
[59:41.960 --> 01:00:11.480]  As well, we are always ready to answer any questions you may have.
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:19.840]  Okay, Don, DC, Phillip, Brad, Michael, Jim, David, Steele, Peter, Timber, Ty, I'm going
[01:00:19.840 --> 01:00:20.840]  to get to all of you.
[01:00:20.840 --> 01:00:28.320]  Then I need to get more into Fukushima, more on the federal government issuing more waivers
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:32.360]  to insiders that don't have to buy insurance, but everybody else does, for their employees.
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:38.720]  That will just be taken out of the employee's paycheck and done through layoffs.
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:45.240]  We're also going to get into some of the latest TSA harassment that's going on.
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:54.840]  The big one, after I take a big round of calls, is the serious deterioration of the borders
[01:00:54.840 --> 01:00:58.960]  of Israel and the overall destabilization of the Middle East.
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:05.920]  Eight killed, Israeli troops up on fire on Nakba Day border protests, so that's coming
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:06.920]  up.
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:08.840]  Let's go to Don in Michigan.
[01:01:08.840 --> 01:01:11.040]  Don, thanks for holding her on the ear.
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:12.040]  Hello.
[01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:13.040]  Yes, sir.
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.040]  Go ahead.
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.040]  Good to talk to you, Alex.
[01:01:16.040 --> 01:01:17.040]  Yeah, I did.
[01:01:17.040 --> 01:01:26.320]  I'm with you on the mainstream media that's killing me, absolutely killing me.
[01:01:26.320 --> 01:01:32.320]  And I kind of put my job in line, and I'll find out tomorrow what the outcome is.
[01:01:32.320 --> 01:01:44.080]  And I sent, on work time, I sent out a newscast to our local radio station, and it was through
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:45.080]  work media.
[01:01:45.080 --> 01:01:47.920]  So I don't know if I could read that to you real quick.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.680]  Sure, what is it?
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:50.680]  Okay.
[01:01:50.680 --> 01:01:57.320]  I screwed up, I mean, it's their computer, it's their time, it's, you know, whatever.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:02.080]  But anyway, the gist of my story was you refused to evolve with the awakened people when it
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:06.920]  comes to real news, and continued to feed everyone the lies and propaganda that is fed
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:14.880]  into your station with no desire or self-thinking ability to look deeper into issues that gravely
[01:02:14.880 --> 01:02:19.240]  affect all of us, including my children as well as yours.
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:25.680]  You continued to believe all the crap that mainstream media draws on like a baby to milk,
[01:02:25.680 --> 01:02:30.320]  not even aware that it's orchestrated to keep you oblivious to reality when reality is what
[01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:33.920]  you should be, what should concern you the most.
[01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:37.840]  Only suckers bite on every piece of bait in front of them, especially when pertaining
[01:02:37.840 --> 01:02:44.560]  to wars, politicians, major disasters, et cetera.
[01:02:44.560 --> 01:02:50.920]  Osama's been dead for years, 9-11 was an inside job, and all wars are created for profit by
[01:02:50.920 --> 01:02:55.280]  people that view you and I as weeds and have no worth in our disposal.
[01:02:55.280 --> 01:02:58.160]  Well, let me stop you for a minute here.
[01:02:58.160 --> 01:03:05.680]  Don, because you sent an email at lunch or on a break or whatever you did at work, and
[01:03:05.680 --> 01:03:10.880]  correct me if I'm wrong, to a radio station or TV station, some type of media, and did
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:15.760]  the station send an email back and tattle on you, or is somebody reading your email and
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:18.560]  freaking out over this because of the political context?
[01:03:18.560 --> 01:03:24.200]  I mean, I bet people at work sometimes are sending emails out that aren't work-related.
[01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:27.240]  Are they going to fire everybody, or have you gotten in trouble yet?
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:30.520]  Or why did you preface all of this with that statement?
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:35.560]  I'm very threatened with this right now, I work for a good company, I'm absolutely not
[01:03:35.560 --> 01:03:36.560]  going to say the name.
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:39.680]  No, I don't want you to say the name, I want you to answer my question.
[01:03:39.680 --> 01:03:47.120]  Have they, I mean, did the media outfit you sent this email to, did they tattle on you,
[01:03:47.120 --> 01:03:48.120]  or?
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:54.560]  Yes, yes, they devolved my name because my name was linked to the company name.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:59.880]  Well, that just shows you how America has turned into a bunch of tattletales.
[01:03:59.880 --> 01:04:03.560]  And they're all told, see something, say something, so here you are sending an email
[01:04:03.560 --> 01:04:08.360]  from work saying, I don't agree with what your radio or TV station's doing.
[01:04:08.360 --> 01:04:10.520]  Was it radio, TV, or newspaper?
[01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:14.360]  It was radio, and it's a major radio station, and it's how you do it.
[01:04:14.360 --> 01:04:18.760]  Okay, so you as an American dared send your political opinion, so they sat there and giggled
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:27.920]  and said, we'll get Don, ha ha ha, and this horrible creature then sent this to your boss
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:29.760]  hoping to get you in trouble.
[01:04:29.760 --> 01:04:35.840]  Absolutely, and I knew, I said it a week ago, Friday Alex.
[01:04:35.840 --> 01:04:41.480]  Well Don, I'll tell you what, as soon as you know what happened with us, with this story,
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:42.600]  let us know, okay?
[01:04:42.600 --> 01:04:47.000]  I'm sorry to hear that happen to you, but we've got to think smart here, when we're
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:51.480]  going to engage in political activism, it's best to not do it from the workplace.
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:55.880]  If your workplace doesn't, you know, authorize that or do it from your own private email
[01:04:55.880 --> 01:04:59.120]  during your lunch hour, show these little dirty rats.
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:03.760]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:05:03.760 --> 01:05:08.080]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:12.400]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:13.720]  allows you to have.
[01:05:13.720 --> 01:05:14.720]  It's true.
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:19.480]  There's no government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:05:19.480 --> 01:05:23.800]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:27.800]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:05:27.800 --> 01:05:31.320]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:05:31.320 --> 01:05:35.000]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:39.720]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:05:39.720 --> 01:05:43.560]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:44.920]  to my oldest sponsors.
[01:05:44.920 --> 01:05:49.160]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:50.760]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:05:50.760 --> 01:06:17.600]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:25.240]  All right, folks.
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:26.240]  Here's the deal.
[01:06:26.240 --> 01:06:28.840]  We're now live into hour number two.
[01:06:28.840 --> 01:06:38.920]  I've got great political activist, national TV host now on RT, Luke Radowski, popping
[01:06:38.920 --> 01:06:42.280]  in coming up at the bottom of the hour for one segment, then we'll continue with calls
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:45.280]  right through the end of the transmission today.
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:50.440]  We've got about 54 minutes left here in broadcast time today.
[01:06:50.440 --> 01:06:57.880]  I do want to get into the ongoing destabilization of the Middle East, now making its way to
[01:06:57.880 --> 01:06:58.880]  Israel.
[01:06:58.880 --> 01:06:59.880]  We knew that was coming.
[01:06:59.880 --> 01:07:06.000]  Eight killed, at least, the numbers it appears may grow because these numbers always come
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:08.080]  out lower than they are later.
[01:07:08.080 --> 01:07:14.160]  Eight killed as Israeli troops opened fire on Nakba Day protest, many more wounded in
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:22.720]  clashes at Israel's borders with Syria, Gaza, and Lebanon as UN appeals for maximum restraint.
[01:07:22.720 --> 01:07:27.400]  Continuing Palestinian Nakba protests turned deadly.
[01:07:27.400 --> 01:07:31.200]  Israel sees Iran's fingertips.
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:33.360]  Continuing here's Heretz.
[01:07:33.360 --> 01:07:39.040]  Eight killed as IDF fires on infiltrators from Syria and Lebanon.
[01:07:39.040 --> 01:07:40.480]  Here's another one.
[01:07:40.480 --> 01:07:45.360]  Several Palestinian violence erupts on three borders, Reuters.
[01:07:45.360 --> 01:07:47.760]  Here's my point.
[01:07:47.760 --> 01:07:57.080]  If you go to Arutz Sheva, big Israeli national news, they've got footage of people that don't
[01:07:57.080 --> 01:08:04.880]  look like armed terrorists to me rioting and then being attacked, and this is not what
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:08.120]  I'd call Iranian-backed terrorist, I'll just tell you.
[01:08:08.120 --> 01:08:11.480]  And before I go to your calls, I'm going to get more into this later, here's my point
[01:08:11.480 --> 01:08:15.480]  on this front.
[01:08:15.480 --> 01:08:20.840]  Libya is fighting against al-Qaeda-backed rebels, that is admitted even by the Wall Street Journal
[01:08:20.840 --> 01:08:22.800]  New York Times.
[01:08:22.800 --> 01:08:26.960]  Libya is being bombed by NATO for fighting back against them.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:32.400]  Now here's Israel saying they're fighting Iranian-backed rioters and they're shooting
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:35.320]  them and our media is like, atta boy, get them.
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:37.160]  This is all just hypocritical.
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:42.120]  I'm saying let's not bomb Libya and let's not bomb Israel either.
[01:08:42.120 --> 01:08:44.080]  And let's not bomb Syria.
[01:08:44.080 --> 01:08:49.280]  The State Department admits they've been financing the Muslim Brotherhood in southern
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:55.600]  Syria for a month-long military-style attacks on Assad.
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:00.920]  And the Russians came out last week and said, if you try to bombard them, we may intervene.
[01:09:00.920 --> 01:09:04.720]  And the Russians tell you they're going to intervene, folks, and historically they're
[01:09:04.720 --> 01:09:06.160]  going to do it.
[01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:08.920]  Russia normally will sit back if it's not going to do anything.
[01:09:08.920 --> 01:09:13.520]  But if Russia says we think we're probably going to do something, look out.
[01:09:13.520 --> 01:09:19.520]  You already saw that Bluff Cheney ran on 888 when they kicked off the Olympics in Beijing
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:25.160]  and over in Georgia NATO launched those attacks through Georgia into South Ossetia and Abkhazia.
[01:09:25.160 --> 01:09:29.160]  The Russian held enclaves and Russia rolled in and just blew the daylights out of them
[01:09:29.160 --> 01:09:32.760]  and then rolled mobile nukes in and said we're prepared to launch nukes.
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:36.720]  I mean, it's just, see, I love my children.
[01:09:36.720 --> 01:09:38.880]  I don't want to have World War III.
[01:09:38.880 --> 01:09:44.520]  These globalists like Strauss-Kahn and Obama and stuff may think it's cute and fun.
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:45.520]  I don't think it's funny.
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:46.520]  All right, all right.
[01:09:46.520 --> 01:09:49.160]  I said I'd go to your calls because there's a loaded phone line here.
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:50.480]  I want to get to everybody.
[01:09:50.480 --> 01:09:54.080]  Brad, Michael, Jim, David, Steven, Peter, Timber, Ty, others.
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.080]  Number to join us.
[01:09:55.080 --> 01:09:56.080]  H77789 Alex.
[01:09:56.080 --> 01:09:59.600]  When I go to your calls, short and sweet, because I want to get to everybody.
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:01.440]  Brad and Pennsylvania, you're on the air.
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:02.440]  Go ahead.
[01:10:02.440 --> 01:10:05.040]  Hey, Alex, happy Sunday to you.
[01:10:05.040 --> 01:10:06.040]  Thank you, sir.
[01:10:06.040 --> 01:10:07.040]  What's on your mind?
[01:10:07.040 --> 01:10:08.880]  I just want to mention a couple of things.
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:10.800]  I think it's the total thing.
[01:10:10.800 --> 01:10:14.280]  The big picture is dehumanization and depopulation.
[01:10:14.280 --> 01:10:18.240]  That's what the globalists are all about, and that's what they're trying to do.
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:20.280]  Well, I agree with you.
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:25.720]  At the end of the day, they believe in survival of the fittest, social Darwinism, and that
[01:10:25.720 --> 01:10:31.320]  it's their right to dominate the planet and then to basically forcibly reduce the population
[01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:35.960]  so that the elite in their progeny can enjoy the fruits of the earth.
[01:10:35.960 --> 01:10:37.320]  And that's their own statements.
[01:10:37.320 --> 01:10:41.640]  I cover it at Nauseum in my film, Endgame, blueprint for global enslavement.
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:43.720]  And that's their ballgame.
[01:10:43.720 --> 01:10:47.840]  What do you think about Israel shooting and killing at least eight people that were rioting
[01:10:47.840 --> 01:10:49.480]  and throwing rocks?
[01:10:49.480 --> 01:10:53.600]  Should NATO now bombard Israel and invade Israel?
[01:10:53.600 --> 01:10:59.840]  Should NATO bomb the Knesset with 2,000-pound bombs and try to kill Benjamin Netanyahu?
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:05.040]  I don't think they should, but under what they're doing in Libya, that's what they should
[01:11:05.040 --> 01:11:06.040]  do.
[01:11:06.040 --> 01:11:12.520]  In Syria, like you said, but it's who they want to mess with and what they probably want
[01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:16.520]  to start in these other countries, Israel ain't one of them.
[01:11:16.520 --> 01:11:17.520]  Absolutely.
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.520]  So it's openly hypocritical.
[01:11:18.520 --> 01:11:22.240]  It has nothing to do with humanitarian actions.
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:25.520]  But how do you think a good old boy out there, reading the Wall Street Journal, where they
[01:11:25.520 --> 01:11:30.360]  admit the core of the anti-Qaddafi group is al-Qaeda, meeting with Obama officials, being
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:32.640]  funded by him?
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:36.040]  And I guess al-Qaeda are now the good guys?
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:38.480]  It's so much disinformation.
[01:11:38.480 --> 01:11:39.480]  It's ridiculous.
[01:11:39.480 --> 01:11:44.440]  And thank you very much for doing your part and telling the truth, because God knows we
[01:11:44.440 --> 01:11:48.680]  need somebody to help us discern the information in the disinformation.
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:50.800]  Hey, Brad, are you a radio guy?
[01:11:50.800 --> 01:11:53.080]  No, but I always get that deer.
[01:11:53.080 --> 01:11:54.240]  I wish I was.
[01:11:54.240 --> 01:11:57.600]  Well, usually people have phones nowadays, you can't even understand them with all these
[01:11:57.600 --> 01:12:01.800]  Skype phones and stuff and cell phones that cut out of you, you know, stand behind a bush.
[01:12:01.800 --> 01:12:06.320]  But any other points you want to add, Brad?
[01:12:06.320 --> 01:12:10.400]  Just like you're talking about maybe with that French guy, maybe it is some kind of
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.600]  thing, so he'll lose the election.
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:17.680]  And also on Ron Paul, you don't talk enough about the fact that they, when he was one
[01:12:17.680 --> 01:12:22.280]  of the primaries in New Hampshire, when he was running last time, they definitely tampered
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:23.280]  with the results.
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:26.080]  I think he may have won that thing, but they totally screwed it.
[01:12:26.080 --> 01:12:27.080]  That's right.
[01:12:27.080 --> 01:12:31.360]  Exit polls showed he should have gotten three times more than he should have.
[01:12:31.360 --> 01:12:36.320]  And he's been number one or number two in all these polls for six months.
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:37.320]  Absolutely.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:39.560]  But Brad, I appreciate your call.
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:45.560]  Look on the Ron Paul front, he's going to be the only Republican injecting true Americana,
[01:12:45.560 --> 01:12:49.440]  true libertarian constitutional ideas in the debates.
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:52.560]  And it's going to build the Liberty movement like nothing before.
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:57.100]  I mean, look what happened three years ago, and it's going to position Rand in the future
[01:12:57.100 --> 01:13:00.880]  with name identification to end up being president.
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:03.760]  There's a chance Ron Paul could end up being president.
[01:13:03.760 --> 01:13:07.640]  But there's an even better chance, Rand Paul or somebody else like him down the road.
[01:13:07.640 --> 01:13:09.160]  Very exciting.
[01:13:09.160 --> 01:13:11.000]  Michelle in Virginia, you're on the air.
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:12.000]  Go ahead.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000]  Hello.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:14.000]  Michael.
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:16.760]  You know, I just can't get my name straight today.
[01:13:16.760 --> 01:13:18.560]  Michael, but we'll call you Michelle.
[01:13:18.560 --> 01:13:19.560]  We'll call me Michelle.
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:20.560]  Go ahead.
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:25.320]  Yeah, it's Michael, and I want to quote you from about five minutes ago.
[01:13:25.320 --> 01:13:28.960]  You said, I don't want to have World War III.
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:31.640]  I've been listening to you for several years.
[01:13:31.640 --> 01:13:38.240]  I've never heard you come up with a plan for avoiding World War III.
[01:13:38.240 --> 01:13:43.720]  My good friend, David Rockefeller, at least makes an attempt at it.
[01:13:43.720 --> 01:13:48.520]  My good friend, Baron de Rothschild, at least makes an attempt at it.
[01:13:48.520 --> 01:13:56.120]  My good friends at the INF have at least made an attempt at it, but I can't even get Alex
[01:13:56.120 --> 01:14:03.520]  Jones to debate me on this issue so that we can bring Christians, evangelical Christians
[01:14:03.520 --> 01:14:11.640]  in particular, into the 21st century and back to what the Bible actually says our responsibility
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:12.640]  is.
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:21.160]  Brad, Brad, Brad, I mean, look, number one, I don't know who you are, so are Michael.
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:24.040]  You know what we've got to do, guys?
[01:14:24.040 --> 01:14:29.400]  They've got a TV set in here about eight feet away, and the names are so little that I guess
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:33.680]  my eyesight isn't as good as it used to be, so that's why I keep getting the names wrong.
[01:14:33.680 --> 01:14:35.920]  And I think we need to maybe bring a monitor.
[01:14:35.920 --> 01:14:39.640]  Can we cut a hole in the desk right here and maybe have a monitor in it so I can see the
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:43.520]  calls here because I think that's what's causing me to bumble around here.
[01:14:43.520 --> 01:14:48.520]  Michael, in Virginia, number one, I don't know who you are.
[01:14:48.520 --> 01:14:51.960]  Number two, you say I won't debate you.
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:55.920]  Number three, you say all these people are your good friends, and you have this appeal
[01:14:55.920 --> 01:15:05.360]  to authority that you have answered all the ways to stop World War III, and you're implying
[01:15:05.360 --> 01:15:10.040]  that all these globalists are trying to stop World War III when it's the IMF and the World
[01:15:10.040 --> 01:15:13.040]  Bank and the globalists that are launching all these new wars.
[01:15:13.040 --> 01:15:17.360]  So I don't know who you are from the man on the moon, Michael.
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:25.080]  Well, look, everybody is doing it according to their own individual twisted or enlightened
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:26.080]  ideas.
[01:15:26.080 --> 01:15:27.760]  Well, what do you mean I won't debate you?
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:28.920]  I don't know who you are.
[01:15:28.920 --> 01:15:30.920]  You're making false statements.
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:32.960]  Well, well...
[01:15:32.960 --> 01:15:36.240]  Is that caller still there?
[01:15:36.240 --> 01:15:37.240]  Is he gone?
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.240]  Yeah, I'm still here.
[01:15:38.240 --> 01:15:39.240]  I'm still here.
[01:15:39.240 --> 01:15:40.240]  I'm asking you who you are.
[01:15:40.240 --> 01:15:42.240]  You're calling up saying I'm afraid to debate you.
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:43.240]  I mean, it's like...
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:45.240]  I'll tell you what, you're W-T-A-R-a-pilliott.
[01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:52.360]  Look, I'm just going to come back to you after a break, but just short and sweet, explain
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:57.440]  to me how David Rockefeller is trying to save us and how I've refused to debate you,
[01:15:57.440 --> 01:15:58.440]  okay?
[01:15:58.440 --> 01:16:00.440]  We'll come right back.
[01:16:00.440 --> 01:16:21.520]  I'm looking for a factory where a man can feed his family, not worried about them moving
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:34.400]  to the south, closing the doors and shutting her down tomorrow.
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:35.400]  I'm looking for America.
[01:16:35.400 --> 01:16:36.400]  Where American and B-Proud go to gusset.com forward slash America.
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:37.400]  Land on a free in the home of the brave.
[01:16:37.400 --> 01:16:38.400]  Seems like I just woke up one day and it was gone.
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:39.400]  Long gone.
[01:16:39.400 --> 01:17:00.640]  Again, go to gusset.com forward slash America today.
[01:17:00.640 --> 01:17:04.920]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced emergencies
[01:17:04.920 --> 01:17:07.720]  and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[01:17:07.720 --> 01:17:10.080]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[01:17:10.080 --> 01:17:12.480]  Folks, this is Steve Shank with E-Foods Direct.
[01:17:12.480 --> 01:17:17.000]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes, you won't have time to think.
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.760]  You must act automatically.
[01:17:18.760 --> 01:17:22.200]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[01:17:22.200 --> 01:17:23.400]  No time to think.
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:24.400]  Just act automatically.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:29.440]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door, you'll need
[01:17:29.440 --> 01:17:33.360]  to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[01:17:33.360 --> 01:17:38.480]  You need a five-day extreme emergency kit with serious supplies and real food to secure
[01:17:38.480 --> 01:17:40.280]  to adults for five days.
[01:17:40.280 --> 01:17:47.120]  This powerful $300 extreme emergency kit is free with an order of at least $995 from
[01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.120]  E-Foods Direct.
[01:17:48.120 --> 01:17:54.360]  Go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex, or call 800-409-5633.
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:59.840]  That's efoodsdirect.com slash Alex, 800-409-5633.
[01:17:59.840 --> 01:18:04.280]  You may be arrested and or subject to other police action.
[01:18:04.280 --> 01:18:05.520]  Tyranny is here.
[01:18:05.520 --> 01:18:09.120]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:11.840]  It really says that the state is God.
[01:18:11.840 --> 01:18:16.400]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:17.640]  on Earth.
[01:18:17.640 --> 01:18:22.440]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being
[01:18:22.440 --> 01:18:24.280]  expanded nationwide.
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:28.280]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an
[01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:30.320]  old powerful shadow state.
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:34.480]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:38.840]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:43.920]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, staged terror and cameras on every street
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:44.920]  corner.
[01:18:44.920 --> 01:18:48.160]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[01:18:48.160 --> 01:18:50.200]  The police state isn't coming.
[01:18:50.200 --> 01:18:51.200]  It's here.

[01:19:26.760 --> 01:19:32.280]  Your risk is the hundreds of hazardous toxic detergents that give you rashes, itching sores
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:34.680]  and deteriorating clothing called lint.
[01:19:34.680 --> 01:19:38.000]  If you want something better, if you want something you've never had before, you have
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.040]  to do something you've never done before.

[01:20:00.840 --> 01:20:03.840]  Coast to coast, direct from Austin.
[01:20:03.840 --> 01:20:08.840]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[01:20:08.840 --> 01:20:19.840]  Okay, I watched the IMF, the World Bank, the Council on Foreign Relations,
[01:20:19.840 --> 01:20:24.840]  putting in place eugenics, putting in place population reduction,
[01:20:24.840 --> 01:20:27.840]  putting in place tax on the family.
[01:20:27.840 --> 01:20:32.840]  I see our own State Department financing Muslim extremists all over the Middle East
[01:20:32.840 --> 01:20:34.840]  to destabilize that region.
[01:20:34.840 --> 01:20:38.840]  I see our own government trying to encircle China and Russia while at the same time
[01:20:38.840 --> 01:20:40.840]  building up China.
[01:20:40.840 --> 01:20:47.840]  And Michael calls in all high and mighty and lists a group of evil people
[01:20:47.840 --> 01:20:52.840]  who've been involved in all sorts of anti-freedom movements on record
[01:20:52.840 --> 01:20:57.840]  and calls them his friends and then says, I won't debate him
[01:20:57.840 --> 01:21:01.840]  and I don't know who he is from Brad or anybody else that called before him.
[01:21:01.840 --> 01:21:03.840]  And it's just a bizarre thing.
[01:21:03.840 --> 01:21:07.840]  You've got 60 seconds to tell us how to stop World War III
[01:21:07.840 --> 01:21:12.840]  and how for Christians to come into the 21st century and join BLZBob.
[01:21:12.840 --> 01:21:16.840]  Okay, I can do it in less than 60 minutes.
[01:21:16.840 --> 01:21:23.840]  You debate me on Coast to Coast AM and we will solve the problem.
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:26.840]  Okay, Michael, you're a crackpot.
[01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.840]  You won't even tell me who you are.
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:31.840]  You're saying that I'm afraid to debate you.
[01:21:31.840 --> 01:21:34.840]  I've never talked to you before.
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:37.840]  Let him go, let him go, let him go.
[01:21:37.840 --> 01:21:39.840]  Just more idiocy.
[01:21:39.840 --> 01:21:41.840]  Jim in Texas, you're on the air.
[01:21:41.840 --> 01:21:42.840]  Go ahead.
[01:21:42.840 --> 01:21:44.840]  That guy was funny, Alex.
[01:21:44.840 --> 01:21:48.840]  I'm calling down on what seems like a local issue,
[01:21:48.840 --> 01:21:51.840]  but it's really got a lot of globalist underpinning.
[01:21:51.840 --> 01:21:54.840]  It's the Formula One race track that they're bringing to office.
[01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:58.840]  Oh, yeah, we're supposed to pay hundreds of millions of taxpayer money.
[01:21:58.840 --> 01:22:02.840]  Just like in Dallas, a billion bucks of taxpayer money or more,
[01:22:02.840 --> 01:22:04.840]  but it came out to over a billion, didn't it?
[01:22:04.840 --> 01:22:06.840]  For that stupid cowboy stadium.
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:09.840]  You know what, if you want a cowboy stadium, you pay for it.
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:11.840]  You want a Formula One, you pay for it.
[01:22:11.840 --> 01:22:13.840]  That's what the New World Order is.
[01:22:13.840 --> 01:22:18.840]  It's always about big fat cats and select insiders that I've got a bankroll.
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:19.840]  Look at this.
[01:22:19.840 --> 01:22:21.840]  If this stuff goes through and they don't repeal it,
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:23.840]  I've got to get insurance for every one of my employees,
[01:22:23.840 --> 01:22:24.840]  whether they like it or not.
[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:28.840]  So all I'm going to do is fire every one of them and hire them back as part-time contractors
[01:22:28.840 --> 01:22:32.840]  so they can buy their own insurance because they don't want me to get them insurance
[01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:33.840]  and take their money.
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:34.840]  They want it.
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:38.840]  But then meanwhile, Obama just handed out hundreds more,
[01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:41.840]  200 more to his little crony bullies.
[01:22:41.840 --> 01:22:44.840]  They don't have to get insurance, but I do.
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:45.840]  It's discrimination.
[01:22:45.840 --> 01:22:47.840]  It's an unfair trade advantage.
[01:22:47.840 --> 01:22:52.840]  I don't want to pay for the stupid bike program for insiders.
[01:22:52.840 --> 01:22:55.840]  I don't want to pay for the stupid Formula One track.
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:22:58.840]  If some European insider wants to come build that stinking thing,
[01:22:58.840 --> 01:23:00.840]  then they need to buy the land and bill it.
[01:23:00.840 --> 01:23:02.840]  Stop taking my money.
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:05.840]  You know what happens if I don't pay the property taxes to this stinking city.
[01:23:05.840 --> 01:23:11.840]  If I don't sit there and give that scumbag corrupt mobster city council all my money,
[01:23:11.840 --> 01:23:15.840]  they will come to take my house and sell it on the courthouse steps.
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:18.840]  And if I don't leave my house and I barricade myself in it,
[01:23:18.840 --> 01:23:21.840]  they will send the Austin SWAT team to murder me.
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:23.840]  They will shoot bullets into me.
[01:23:23.840 --> 01:23:25.840]  They will kill me.
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:28.840]  And they will kill you in Detroit or Los Angeles or anywhere else
[01:23:28.840 --> 01:23:33.840]  so they can take my money and give it to the Formula One scum.
[01:23:33.840 --> 01:23:35.840]  I'm sorry. It's theft.
[01:23:35.840 --> 01:23:36.840]  I'm sorry. Go ahead, sir.
[01:23:36.840 --> 01:23:38.840]  This is the essence of tyranny.
[01:23:38.840 --> 01:23:41.840]  It's the essence of why this country is going down the rattle.
[01:23:41.840 --> 01:23:42.840]  I'm sorry.
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:43.840]  You're absolutely right.
[01:23:43.840 --> 01:23:46.840]  Alex, in line by line, 20 countries with Formula One,
[01:23:46.840 --> 01:23:49.840]  every one of them is government funded.
[01:23:49.840 --> 01:23:52.840]  They're the poster boys for globalism.
[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:54.840]  So is soccer. So is all of it.
[01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:57.840]  They've built hundreds of these mega stadiums worldwide.
[01:23:57.840 --> 01:23:59.840]  Pay for it yourself.
[01:23:59.840 --> 01:24:02.840]  And what's the guy with the IMF problem right now?
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:03.840]  What's his name?
[01:24:03.840 --> 01:24:06.840]  Mr. Talley, something?
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:12.840]  All of these globalists, you've always said, they're just so out there.
[01:24:12.840 --> 01:24:16.840]  This guy in charge of Formula One, Bernie Eccleston, on record,
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:20.840]  look it up online, Prave Hitler said he hates democracy
[01:24:20.840 --> 01:24:23.840]  because it gets in the way of everything.
[01:24:23.840 --> 01:24:25.840]  And it fits the bill.
[01:24:25.840 --> 01:24:31.840]  And now, Rupert Mordoch's news corp is trying to take over the sport,
[01:24:31.840 --> 01:24:34.840]  called City Hall in Austin, Texas, and tell him,
[01:24:34.840 --> 01:24:36.840]  you don't want the Formula One racetrack.
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:37.840]  We're not going to pay for it.
[01:24:37.840 --> 01:24:40.840]  Call the Texas Senators and your house reps,
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:42.840]  tell them we're not going to pay for it.
[01:24:42.840 --> 01:24:45.840]  And by the way, Jim, if people don't think we have power,
[01:24:45.840 --> 01:24:48.840]  I just have the state rep on Friday, Simons,
[01:24:48.840 --> 01:24:50.840]  they have now passed it in the house.
[01:24:50.840 --> 01:24:52.840]  It's going to pass in the Senate.
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:53.840]  They've got the votes.
[01:24:53.840 --> 01:24:55.840]  People need to keep putting pressure on them
[01:24:55.840 --> 01:24:58.840]  so that the feds can't stick their hands down our kids' pants
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:01.840]  and grab our wives' breasts at the airports.
[01:25:01.840 --> 01:25:03.840]  And at the federal level, they're cutting the funding
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:08.840]  for the naked body microwave scanners that are for Benjamin Cherdoff,
[01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:11.840]  Michael Cherdoff, all these people to make money,
[01:25:11.840 --> 01:25:15.840]  Dominique Strauss, Conn, all of them, and you're absolutely right.
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:17.840]  But listen, that's why I got angry.
[01:25:17.840 --> 01:25:21.840]  My house's values gone way down, okay?
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:24.840]  I'm upside down, but they keep raising my property taxes.
[01:25:24.840 --> 01:25:27.840]  They keep passing the franchise tax on businesses in Texas.
[01:25:27.840 --> 01:25:30.840]  They keep doing all of this where it makes it hard
[01:25:30.840 --> 01:25:32.840]  to operate and exist.
[01:25:32.840 --> 01:25:34.840]  I'm being stolen from.
[01:25:34.840 --> 01:25:37.840]  And then meanwhile, Obama's buddies can have cold-powered plants,
[01:25:37.840 --> 01:25:39.840]  but all their other people get them shut down
[01:25:39.840 --> 01:25:41.840]  and my energy prices go up.
[01:25:41.840 --> 01:25:44.840]  Meanwhile, he's handed out several thousand now.
[01:25:44.840 --> 01:25:48.840]  200 plus were added this week to big insider corporations,
[01:25:48.840 --> 01:25:51.840]  all his contributors, where they don't have to follow the law
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:52.840]  everybody else does.
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:54.840]  We got U.N. bureaucrats running around,
[01:25:54.840 --> 01:25:57.840]  raping people left and right, getting away with it.
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:25:58.840]  I'm sick of it.
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:01.840]  The New World Order is a corporate government coming in
[01:26:01.840 --> 01:26:03.840]  and using government to rob us.
[01:26:03.840 --> 01:26:06.840]  And I'm tired of it, Jim. Good to hear from you.
[01:26:06.840 --> 01:26:08.840]  He got me mad right there.
[01:26:08.840 --> 01:26:11.840]  See, folks, I don't talk about local issues where I live
[01:26:11.840 --> 01:26:14.840]  because this is an international national show.
[01:26:14.840 --> 01:26:16.840]  And I occasionally cover something local
[01:26:16.840 --> 01:26:17.840]  if it has national import,
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:19.840]  but I don't talk about what goes on in this town.
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:22.840]  Believe me, I could do it.
[01:26:22.840 --> 01:26:23.840]  Ah!
[01:26:23.840 --> 01:26:25.840]  Let's go ahead and talk to David in California.
[01:26:25.840 --> 01:26:27.840]  Go ahead, you're on the air.
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:30.840]  Sounds like I picked a good day to call in.
[01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:31.840]  What's up, pal?
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:33.840]  I'm just sick of it.
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:34.840]  Hey, hey, I'm with you, man.
[01:26:34.840 --> 01:26:36.840]  And look, you got what the world needs.
[01:26:36.840 --> 01:26:39.840]  There's a lot of people calling you a net and craving all this.
[01:26:39.840 --> 01:26:40.840]  You know what?
[01:26:40.840 --> 01:26:43.840]  I'd be crazy if I didn't want to pay my tax money
[01:26:43.840 --> 01:26:47.840]  for some guy in Europe to have his race car track.
[01:26:47.840 --> 01:26:48.840]  And then they...
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:50.840]  Oh, I can't handle it. Go ahead.
[01:26:50.840 --> 01:26:52.840]  Sure, you're crazy.
[01:26:52.840 --> 01:26:55.840]  And you don't want your kids fondled and molested
[01:26:55.840 --> 01:26:56.840]  every time you want to take a trip.
[01:26:56.840 --> 01:26:57.840]  No, you're crazy.
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:26:58.840]  You're an extremist.
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:26:59.840]  No, I know how it goes, buddy.
[01:26:59.840 --> 01:27:00.840]  I'm on to you.
[01:27:00.840 --> 01:27:02.840]  Anyway, thanks for listening to you.
[01:27:02.840 --> 01:27:04.840]  I've only been to and then through the internet here
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:06.840]  and I'll keep it short.
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:08.840]  You know, I started looking around and seeing...
[01:27:08.840 --> 01:27:11.840]  We've got a lot of these internet-based attacks now,
[01:27:11.840 --> 01:27:13.840]  the PlayStation Network just came back up.
[01:27:13.840 --> 01:27:14.840]  People aren't really paying attention to it.
[01:27:14.840 --> 01:27:16.840]  I think it's false flagged.
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:18.840]  Not too long ago before the government shut down,
[01:27:18.840 --> 01:27:19.840]  I think it was a couple...
[01:27:19.840 --> 01:27:21.840]  No, I've been predicting that they're going to have false flags
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:24.840]  against the web as a pretext to take it over.
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:26.840]  And there's even Pentagon reports
[01:27:26.840 --> 01:27:27.840]  where they admit they're doing it.
[01:27:27.840 --> 01:27:28.840]  Go ahead.
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:29.840]  Yeah.
[01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:30.840]  Oh, it's well-known now, yeah.
[01:27:30.840 --> 01:27:31.840]  You know, and...
[01:27:31.840 --> 01:27:34.840]  It's like the antivirus companies are well-known to be out there
[01:27:34.840 --> 01:27:35.840]  making the viruses.
[01:27:35.840 --> 01:27:36.840]  Sorry.
[01:27:36.840 --> 01:27:38.840]  Well, yeah, I mean, but you can...
[01:27:38.840 --> 01:27:39.840]  You can...
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:42.840]  You can say that about, you know, computer software companies,
[01:27:42.840 --> 01:27:44.840]  antivirus, you can say that about your medical companies,
[01:27:44.840 --> 01:27:47.840]  you know, the money is in the medicine, you know,
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:50.840]  so if they can make you believe they've got the answer
[01:27:50.840 --> 01:27:52.840]  and you've got to pay for it, hey, you know,
[01:27:52.840 --> 01:27:53.840]  they got the game locked up.
[01:27:53.840 --> 01:27:56.840]  But yeah, you know, my biggest conundrum now
[01:27:56.840 --> 01:28:00.840]  is I've never called in really, really pleased
[01:28:00.840 --> 01:28:02.840]  at what you do and I think we need more people like you.
[01:28:02.840 --> 01:28:06.840]  But, you know, this whole thing has really gotten me jaded
[01:28:06.840 --> 01:28:10.840]  since getting on to, you know, the path of enlightenment.
[01:28:10.840 --> 01:28:11.840]  I'll call it.
[01:28:11.840 --> 01:28:13.840]  You know, it's a really looking at what the hired help is doing.
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.840]  You know, they...
[01:28:15.840 --> 01:28:17.840]  We gave them the job.
[01:28:17.840 --> 01:28:18.840]  We put them in office.
[01:28:18.840 --> 01:28:19.840]  It's we the people, man.
[01:28:19.840 --> 01:28:21.840]  The bill of rights is written in cursive
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:23.840]  and you're not even teaching cursive in schools anymore.
[01:28:23.840 --> 01:28:25.840]  No, it's like having a dog.
[01:28:25.840 --> 01:28:28.840]  You try to sit on your couch and it growls at you.
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:31.840]  It's like having employees and you come in
[01:28:31.840 --> 01:28:34.840]  and the employees tell you to, you know, to lick their boots.
[01:28:34.840 --> 01:28:38.840]  It's completely backwards and great point today,
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:39.840]  but good to hear from you.
[01:28:39.840 --> 01:28:42.840]  Steve, Peter, Timber, Ty, others, your calls are coming up.
[01:28:42.840 --> 01:28:44.840]  But I think about Austin, Texas.
[01:28:44.840 --> 01:28:46.840]  These are not liberals that run this town.
[01:28:46.840 --> 01:28:51.840]  This is a corrupt inner core of people who take private property
[01:28:51.840 --> 01:28:54.840]  for environmental reasons and then hand it over to themselves.
[01:28:54.840 --> 01:28:58.840]  That $2 million for 300 bicycles.
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:28.840]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:29:28.840 --> 01:29:31.840]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:29:31.840 --> 01:29:35.840]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:40.840]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:44.840]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science,
[01:29:44.840 --> 01:29:45.840]  one of my old sponsors.
[01:29:45.840 --> 01:29:49.840]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:29:49.840 --> 01:29:51.840]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:29:51.840 --> 01:29:55.840]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com
[01:29:55.840 --> 01:29:59.840]  or call 1-877-327-0365.
[01:29:59.840 --> 01:30:03.840]  Over the last year, Alex has told you about and many of you have experienced
[01:30:03.840 --> 01:30:06.840]  emergencies and disasters in unprecedented numbers.
[01:30:06.840 --> 01:30:09.840]  People have had to literally run for their lives.
[01:30:09.840 --> 01:30:11.840]  Folks, this is Steve Schenck with EFU's Direct.
[01:30:11.840 --> 01:30:14.840]  I'm not here to scare you, but when disaster strikes,
[01:30:14.840 --> 01:30:16.840]  you won't have time to think.
[01:30:16.840 --> 01:30:17.840]  You must act automatically.
[01:30:17.840 --> 01:30:21.840]  What does a pilot do when the helicopter engine fails in flight?
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:24.840]  No time to think, just act automatically.
[01:30:24.840 --> 01:30:28.840]  When the alert is broadcast, the alarm sounds, or the knock comes on your door,
[01:30:28.840 --> 01:30:32.840]  you'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:35.840]  You need a five-day extreme emergency kit.
[01:30:35.840 --> 01:30:39.840]  With serious supplies and real food to secure two adults for five days,
[01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:43.840]  this powerful $300 extreme emergency kit is free
[01:30:43.840 --> 01:30:47.840]  with an order of at least $995 from EFU's Direct.
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:53.840]  Go to efoodsdirect.com slash Alex, or call 800-409-5633.
[01:30:53.840 --> 01:30:59.840]  That's efoodsdirect.com slash Alex, 800-409-5633.
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:03.840]  A very wealthy US citizen is predicting that in 2011
[01:31:03.840 --> 01:31:07.840]  we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:31:07.840 --> 01:31:10.840]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:31:10.840 --> 01:31:13.840]  May you shop, travel, invest, educate your children,
[01:31:13.840 --> 01:31:15.840]  and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:31:15.840 --> 01:31:18.840]  Now, this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:20.840]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:24.840]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac,
[01:31:24.840 --> 01:31:27.840]  and America's biggest mall owner, general growth properties.
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:30.840]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:33.840]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free,
[01:31:33.840 --> 01:31:36.840]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet,
[01:31:36.840 --> 01:31:37.840]  and it's a real eye-opener.
[01:31:37.840 --> 01:31:39.840]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:31:39.840 --> 01:31:41.840]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:44.840]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:46.840]  you can take to protect yourself.
[01:31:46.840 --> 01:31:50.840]  You can find the video at www.EndofAmerica3.com.
[01:31:50.840 --> 01:31:53.840]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:32:00.840 --> 01:32:02.840]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones,
[01:32:02.840 --> 01:32:04.840]  and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:08.840]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[01:32:08.840 --> 01:32:11.840]  to deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[01:32:11.840 --> 01:32:14.840]  by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:14.840 --> 01:32:16.840]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:18.840]  for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:18.840 --> 01:32:22.840]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system
[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:25.840]  with your self-produced nano-silver solutions
[01:32:25.840 --> 01:32:28.840]  and also delivers the silver nanoparticles
[01:32:28.840 --> 01:32:30.840]  instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:32.840]  With continued legislation threatening the sale
[01:32:32.840 --> 01:32:34.840]  of nano-silver products,
[01:32:34.840 --> 01:32:37.840]  you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver
[01:32:37.840 --> 01:32:39.840]  with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:39.840 --> 01:32:42.840]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided,
[01:32:42.840 --> 01:32:44.840]  making production fast and simple.
[01:32:44.840 --> 01:32:48.840]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today
[01:32:48.840 --> 01:32:50.840]  and learn more about the breakthrough technology
[01:32:50.840 --> 01:32:52.840]  of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:52.840 --> 01:33:08.840]  That's www.SilverLungs.com
[01:33:22.840 --> 01:33:26.840]  Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed
[01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:28.840]  Everybody knows
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:31.840]  Alright, we'll get to David, Steve, Peter, Timber, Tide,
[01:33:31.840 --> 01:33:34.840]  but that'll be it for calls in the time we've got.
[01:33:34.840 --> 01:33:36.840]  We've just got two segments left
[01:33:36.840 --> 01:33:38.840]  and Luke Redaus is going to be joining us in just a moment.
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:40.840]  But I'm going to be honest with you.
[01:33:40.840 --> 01:33:43.840]  I love spending time with my three small children.
[01:33:43.840 --> 01:33:46.840]  My littlest one had some time with stomach bug today.
[01:33:46.840 --> 01:33:48.840]  I almost didn't come in.
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:51.840]  It's such a beautiful day. It's like Valhalla.
[01:33:51.840 --> 01:33:55.840]  And because I'm sick of focusing on the evil.
[01:33:55.840 --> 01:33:59.840]  But I came in because my children have no future.
[01:33:59.840 --> 01:34:01.840]  Your children have no future.
[01:34:01.840 --> 01:34:04.840]  If we don't just face up to how bad things have gotten.
[01:34:04.840 --> 01:34:07.840]  And it's like the last caller said.
[01:34:07.840 --> 01:34:11.840]  The help has gotten out of control.
[01:34:11.840 --> 01:34:13.840]  And I think about the $700 toilet seats
[01:34:13.840 --> 01:34:16.840]  and $800 hammers at the Pentagon decades ago.
[01:34:16.840 --> 01:34:19.840]  I think about the $15 million Haliburton tarps
[01:34:19.840 --> 01:34:21.840]  that cost $500.
[01:34:21.840 --> 01:34:23.840]  I think about the Austin bike program.
[01:34:23.840 --> 01:34:25.840]  They're going to go ahead and try to ram down us.
[01:34:25.840 --> 01:34:29.840]  They've shut down areas like 6th Street.
[01:34:29.840 --> 01:34:31.840]  Part of 6th Street has a bike lane.
[01:34:31.840 --> 01:34:33.840]  Never. I drive it all the time.
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:35.840]  Never do you see a bike.
[01:34:35.840 --> 01:34:38.840]  They make you park backwards now on the street for those shops
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:40.840]  as a way to worship the bikes.
[01:34:40.840 --> 01:34:43.840]  It's all about the government being able, like a mafia,
[01:34:43.840 --> 01:34:45.840]  to control when and how you can use something.
[01:34:45.840 --> 01:34:47.840]  It's been done over and over again.
[01:34:47.840 --> 01:34:49.840]  It's all about smart growth.
[01:34:49.840 --> 01:34:51.840]  Gen. 21, I've read the U.N. documents.
[01:34:51.840 --> 01:34:53.840]  I've made films.
[01:34:53.840 --> 01:34:55.840]  And I see it coming to the town where I live.
[01:34:55.840 --> 01:34:58.840]  And I see them training the police all over the country
[01:34:58.840 --> 01:35:03.840]  for no-knock warrants where they just kick your door down.
[01:35:03.840 --> 01:35:06.840]  Now, many states are saying for any warrant service,
[01:35:06.840 --> 01:35:09.840]  including parking tickets, they're going to kick the door down.
[01:35:09.840 --> 01:35:11.840]  It's all about scaring you.
[01:35:11.840 --> 01:35:13.840]  There was a police chief in Maryland a few years ago
[01:35:13.840 --> 01:35:16.840]  that said, yeah, we wear black mask and helmets to scare you.
[01:35:16.840 --> 01:35:19.840]  I'm scared of evil totally taken over
[01:35:19.840 --> 01:35:22.840]  and America being gone with the wind.
[01:35:22.840 --> 01:35:25.840]  America hadn't been perfect, but the amount of liberty we had here
[01:35:25.840 --> 01:35:27.840]  was greater than any other country.
[01:35:27.840 --> 01:35:29.840]  And it's been wonderful.
[01:35:29.840 --> 01:35:32.840]  And I think about the inside deal.
[01:35:32.840 --> 01:35:34.840]  This is just one little example.
[01:35:34.840 --> 01:35:37.840]  Two million bucks for 300 bikes.
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:40.840]  And a quarter million a year to service them.
[01:35:40.840 --> 01:35:43.840]  And it turns out the San Antonio program is bigger and costs less.
[01:35:43.840 --> 01:35:46.840]  It's just all about flaunting in our face.
[01:35:46.840 --> 01:35:48.840]  And I think about the hundreds of millions.
[01:35:48.840 --> 01:35:50.840]  In fact, I forget the exact number.
[01:35:50.840 --> 01:35:51.840]  Will you look up?
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:52.840]  It's always more later.
[01:35:52.840 --> 01:35:55.840]  Like the Dallas Cowboy Stadium was going to be a half billion.
[01:35:55.840 --> 01:35:57.840]  It was over a billion when it was done.
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:02.840]  Look up real fast the Austin Formula One, the East Austin Formula One,
[01:36:02.840 --> 01:36:05.840]  what they want taxpayers to pay.
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:07.840]  I'm done.
[01:36:07.840 --> 01:36:12.840]  And if I don't pay more taxes, pay more fees, more fines,
[01:36:12.840 --> 01:36:15.840]  more fines to this system, it will come and take my house.
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:17.840]  I don't even own my house.
[01:36:17.840 --> 01:36:20.840]  We didn't have property taxes until 50 years ago in this country.
[01:36:20.840 --> 01:36:22.840]  Property taxes is feudalism.
[01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:25.840]  I don't own my land.
[01:36:25.840 --> 01:36:29.840]  If I don't come up with that money, I lose my house.
[01:36:29.840 --> 01:36:30.840]  And what's it pay for?
[01:36:30.840 --> 01:36:33.840]  Government education, brainwashing.
[01:36:33.840 --> 01:36:34.840]  I'm done.
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:36.840]  I'm done with it, okay?
[01:36:36.840 --> 01:36:37.840]  I want to go to Luke.
[01:36:37.840 --> 01:36:39.840]  We'll hold him in the next segment and cram in these calls.
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:40.840]  I'm going to overdrive if I have to.
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:44.840]  I'm going to get to these calls, but Luke Radowski, 19 years old,
[01:36:44.840 --> 01:36:46.840]  listener of mine, become politically active.
[01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:50.840]  Four or five years later, has a national TV show on RT,
[01:36:50.840 --> 01:36:52.840]  contributor, his own radio show.
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:55.840]  Hundreds and hundreds of We Are Changed chapters around the country,
[01:36:55.840 --> 01:36:59.840]  around the world, fighting the fake global warming, fraud,
[01:36:59.840 --> 01:37:01.840]  false flag terror, all of it.
[01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:02.840]  They're not liberal.
[01:37:02.840 --> 01:37:03.840]  They're not conservative.
[01:37:03.840 --> 01:37:04.840]  They're about justice.
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:07.840]  They're about studying issues and fighting the globalist agenda.
[01:37:07.840 --> 01:37:09.840]  And he went in and confronted Bernanke.
[01:37:09.840 --> 01:37:11.840]  He's confronted hundreds of globalists.
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:13.840]  I mean, you name it, he's done it.
[01:37:13.840 --> 01:37:15.840]  But now he does it as a reporter.
[01:37:15.840 --> 01:37:19.840]  And we're going to play a short clip of him talking to Ben Bernanke,
[01:37:19.840 --> 01:37:24.840]  this mobster in chief, the real president of America illegitimately.
[01:37:24.840 --> 01:37:27.840]  Then we're going to go to Luke and talk about some of the other work he's doing.
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:31.840]  It's a shining testament and example to what you can do when you take action.
[01:37:31.840 --> 01:37:35.840]  I'm very proud of the fact that so many trailblazers have grown from this show.
[01:37:35.840 --> 01:37:39.840]  In my example, though it's my example, certainly, it wasn't perfect.
[01:37:39.840 --> 01:37:42.840]  And those that were examples for me.
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:45.840]  Because you can kill Alex Jones.
[01:37:45.840 --> 01:37:46.840]  You can kill Luke Radowski.
[01:37:46.840 --> 01:37:48.840]  You can't kill ideas.
[01:37:48.840 --> 01:37:50.840]  You can't kill information.
[01:37:50.840 --> 01:37:53.840]  No army can stop an idea whose time has come.
[01:37:53.840 --> 01:37:57.840]  And the restoration of liberty and truth and justice is back.
[01:37:57.840 --> 01:37:59.840]  It's back in style.
[01:37:59.840 --> 01:38:02.840]  There's hundreds of mainstream news articles the last two weeks,
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:07.840]  more than hundreds attacking myself and saying, why are conspiracy theories so popular?
[01:38:07.840 --> 01:38:09.840]  Why does he have now?
[01:38:09.840 --> 01:38:10.840]  I don't even want to tell folks.
[01:38:10.840 --> 01:38:12.840]  It's like five million a day now listeners.
[01:38:12.840 --> 01:38:14.840]  I'm getting so successful.
[01:38:14.840 --> 01:38:18.840]  The globalist don't want to crush me because if they do,
[01:38:18.840 --> 01:38:21.840]  it'll highlight everything I've said and done.
[01:38:21.840 --> 01:38:23.840]  But if they don't, I'm just going to keep growing.
[01:38:23.840 --> 01:38:24.840]  You know what?
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:25.840]  Full speed ahead.
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:27.840]  You can't stop the idea.
[01:38:27.840 --> 01:38:28.840]  But here's that short clip.
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:29.840]  And we're going to Luke.
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:30.840]  Here it is.
[01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:37.840]  Finally, finally, I've been able to get Ben Lucifer Bernacke himself today.
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:40.840]  Very fitting when everybody's struggling in this economy,
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:46.840]  struggling to survive, struggling to pay their mortgage, to even have food.
[01:38:46.840 --> 01:38:52.840]  Ben Bernacke's out celebrating at this huge gala event where all these rich, elite, powerful people
[01:38:52.840 --> 01:38:57.840]  drinking all this expensive alcohol and eating all this expensive food.
[01:38:57.840 --> 01:38:59.840]  Meanwhile, there's children starving.
[01:38:59.840 --> 01:39:01.840]  And I decided to play it smart.
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:06.840]  And that's why I came up to him many times, pretending to take pictures for about 30 minutes.
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:08.840]  And then I just couldn't take it anymore.
[01:39:08.840 --> 01:39:11.840]  And I just had to get it.
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:12.840]  Hey, Ben, just really quick.
[01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:14.840]  What did you do at the 2008 Bilderberg meeting?
[01:39:14.840 --> 01:39:16.840]  I'm not doing any press today.
[01:39:16.840 --> 01:39:17.840]  It was discussed.
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:22.840]  That's where they plan to destroy the economic American economy due to a mole.
[01:39:22.840 --> 01:39:24.840]  I mean, what did you do at the Bilderberg group?
[01:39:24.840 --> 01:39:25.840]  I'm not doing any press today.
[01:39:25.840 --> 01:39:26.840]  No questions?
[01:39:26.840 --> 01:39:27.840]  No.
[01:39:27.840 --> 01:39:28.840]  What did you do there?
[01:39:28.840 --> 01:39:29.840]  You want to know?
[01:39:29.840 --> 01:39:32.840]  When are you going to apologize for destroying this economy, Mr. Bernacke?
[01:39:32.840 --> 01:39:34.840]  That's a very simple question.
[01:39:34.840 --> 01:39:36.840]  What did you do at the Bilderberg meeting?
[01:39:36.840 --> 01:39:41.840]  Of course, you don't want to answer that question because in 2008 and until Virginia,
[01:39:41.840 --> 01:39:45.840]  at the latest Bilderberg meeting, a mole came out right afterwards and said,
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:48.840]  you guys were planning to destroy the U.S. economy, the U.S. dollar,
[01:39:48.840 --> 01:39:50.840]  to bring in a one-world government currency.
[01:39:50.840 --> 01:39:54.840]  And that's exactly what happened after your meeting in June of 2008.
[01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:55.840]  All right, that's enough.
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:59.840]  You can see the whole video at wearchange.org or infowars.com.
[01:39:59.840 --> 01:40:04.840]  But the issue here is 2006, 2007, 2009, right through,
[01:40:04.840 --> 01:40:07.840]  we're able to predict exactly what they're going to do via our moles.
[01:40:07.840 --> 01:40:08.840]  And I was there.
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:11.840]  And we just, if you're a prison planet.tv viewer,
[01:40:11.840 --> 01:40:14.840]  we just showed the video of Bernacke driving in and out.
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:18.840]  And we had U.S. Army in plain clothes harassing us, threatening us.
[01:40:18.840 --> 01:40:23.840]  It was hellish to just be there and show Obama and Hillary in there secretly at the meeting.
[01:40:23.840 --> 01:40:26.840]  The rest of the U.S. media not knowing where they disappeared for that day.
[01:40:26.840 --> 01:40:32.840]  We're calling ABC, NBC going, hey, you want to know where Hillary and them are?
[01:40:32.840 --> 01:40:33.840]  They're right here.
[01:40:33.840 --> 01:40:36.840]  Japanese media did show up.
[01:40:36.840 --> 01:40:38.840]  That's how controlled the press is.
[01:40:38.840 --> 01:40:41.840]  I mean, you got 125 global leaders.
[01:40:41.840 --> 01:40:45.840]  You got the Queen of the Netherlands, Henry Kissinger in there,
[01:40:45.840 --> 01:40:47.840]  Secretary of State in there.
[01:40:47.840 --> 01:40:49.840]  And they didn't want to know.
[01:40:49.840 --> 01:40:52.840]  And we came out and said, okay, they're about to implode the economy.
[01:40:52.840 --> 01:40:53.840]  Here's how they're going to do it.
[01:40:53.840 --> 01:40:54.840]  They're going to want to bank or bail out.
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:57.840]  Then they'll announce a world government, which they've now done.
[01:40:57.840 --> 01:40:59.840]  But the yuppies were told world government doesn't exist.
[01:40:59.840 --> 01:41:04.840]  So they're going to at least try to help Bernacke bring us down because they hate their children.
[01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:05.840]  They hate freedom.
[01:41:05.840 --> 01:41:07.840]  They like feeling like they're part of the establishment.
[01:41:07.840 --> 01:41:10.840]  Luke, great job.
[01:41:10.840 --> 01:41:17.840]  Obviously you shot great high death video of him walking around with the other globalist in there,
[01:41:17.840 --> 01:41:20.840]  the other parasite globalist.
[01:41:20.840 --> 01:41:23.840]  But what else happened behind the scenes?
[01:41:23.840 --> 01:41:27.840]  I mean, as soon as I started asking the question, I had one dude put his hands on me.
[01:41:27.840 --> 01:41:29.840]  Then he put his second hand in the middle.
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:31.840]  He tried to push me out of there.
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:35.840]  I just remember standing in my ground until the second dude came around.
[01:41:35.840 --> 01:41:38.840]  They both grabbed my arm and they literally had to drag me out of there.
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:43.840]  I really didn't want to leave because I just wanted to have a conversation and ask these people questions.
[01:41:43.840 --> 01:41:47.840]  If these people had nothing to hide, if these people weren't doing something wrong,
[01:41:47.840 --> 01:41:49.840]  they would just simply answer the question.
[01:41:49.840 --> 01:41:50.840]  I don't.
[01:41:50.840 --> 01:41:51.840]  That's when it's skeptical.
[01:41:51.840 --> 01:41:54.840]  That's when we have to see that there's something wrong with this puzzle
[01:41:54.840 --> 01:41:56.840]  and that's when we have to get the answers.
[01:41:56.840 --> 01:41:58.840]  Real reporters ask serious questions.
[01:41:58.840 --> 01:42:00.840]  What'd you do at the secret meeting?
[01:42:00.840 --> 01:42:02.840]  We shot video of you there.
[01:42:02.840 --> 01:42:03.840]  You bullhorned them.
[01:42:03.840 --> 01:42:04.840]  I bullhorned them.
[01:42:04.840 --> 01:42:06.840]  Here we are years later in the aftermath.
[01:42:06.840 --> 01:42:07.840]  You're asking a real question.
[01:42:07.840 --> 01:42:12.840]  You're supposed to just go to press conferences and take whatever he vomits on you
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:14.840]  and then repeat it to everyone.
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:16.840]  How dare you ask him a real question?
[01:42:16.840 --> 01:42:18.840]  That is so evil.
[01:42:18.840 --> 01:42:20.840]  I'm here in Washington, D.C. and it's been amazing.
[01:42:20.840 --> 01:42:24.840]  I mean, just this week, I'm going to be releasing a video of me confronting General Hayden,
[01:42:24.840 --> 01:42:27.840]  the former CIA, and then if they had about privacy rights.
[01:42:27.840 --> 01:42:31.840]  I talked to Senator Lieberman about Alawaki having dinner at the Pentagon.
[01:42:31.840 --> 01:42:33.840]  He himself said he would look into it.
[01:42:33.840 --> 01:42:35.840]  I'm going to be releasing a video.
[01:42:35.840 --> 01:42:38.840]  Well, courtesy of my people and interview I did with this morning.
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:39.840]  Stay there.
[01:42:39.840 --> 01:42:43.840]  Let's talk about briefly some of the folks you've confronted.
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:49.840]  You got Gary Hart to admit our government does stage terror attacks
[01:42:49.840 --> 01:42:51.840]  and he basically threatened Iran with that.
[01:42:51.840 --> 01:42:54.840]  Then let's talk about some of the new confrontations and what you're doing.
[01:42:54.840 --> 01:42:58.840]  This is what the media should be doing, but they're too busy lying.
[01:43:00.840 --> 01:43:04.840]  Hundreds of nations have fallen to tyranny in the last century alone.
[01:43:04.840 --> 01:43:08.840]  This is our last chance to not relive history.
[01:43:08.840 --> 01:43:13.840]  As we're finishing off this agenda, we're pulling the rug from underneath the Americans at home.
[01:43:13.840 --> 01:43:17.840]  I have tremendous influence on our president in Congress
[01:43:17.840 --> 01:43:19.840]  and they really are calling the shots.
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:24.840]  I think it's incumbent upon all of us as American citizens to pay attention.
[01:43:24.840 --> 01:43:28.840]  Fall of the Republic identifies the enemies of our nation.
[01:43:28.840 --> 01:43:32.840]  The criminal offshore cartel held bent on destroying sovereignty
[01:43:32.840 --> 01:43:34.840]  and on its ashes constructing world government.
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:37.840]  Tim Geithner, Bernanke, they're arsonists.
[01:43:37.840 --> 01:43:41.840]  They're asking for more matches and the Congress is saying, who do we make the check out to?
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:43.840]  Today seems like nobody does care.
[01:43:43.840 --> 01:43:48.840]  And right now in Washington, D.C., we have seen a fall of the Republic.
[01:43:48.840 --> 01:43:53.840]  Get your copy of Fall of the Republic on DVD at infowars.com
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:59.840]  or watch it online right now in super high quality at prisonplanet.tv.
[01:43:59.840 --> 01:44:04.840]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:08.840]  Number one, new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:44:08.840 --> 01:44:14.840]  Number two, our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:44:14.840 --> 01:44:19.840]  It's true, total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:44:19.840 --> 01:44:24.840]  Number three, in some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded
[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:28.840]  and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:44:28.840 --> 01:44:31.840]  Number four, dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:44:31.840 --> 01:44:35.840]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related onages.
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:40.840]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind.
[01:44:40.840 --> 01:44:45.840]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:03.840]  A very wealthy U.S. citizen is predicting that in 2011,
[01:45:03.840 --> 01:45:07.840]  we will witness the most important day in America in more than 50 years.
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:10.840]  He says it will change everything about our lives.
[01:45:10.840 --> 01:45:12.840]  The way you shop, travel, invest, educate your children,
[01:45:12.840 --> 01:45:15.840]  and even how you take care of your health and your own family.
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:18.840]  Now this man has made some outrageous predictions over the years.
[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:20.840]  The crazy part is, he's usually right.
[01:45:20.840 --> 01:45:24.840]  You see, he predicted the collapse of GM, Panny May, Freddie Mac,
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:27.840]  and America's biggest small owner, General Growth Properties.
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:30.840]  In fact, Barron's called his work a dire prophecy.
[01:45:30.840 --> 01:45:33.840]  Recently, he created a video which you can watch online for free,
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:36.840]  detailing his biggest and most important prediction yet,
[01:45:36.840 --> 01:45:38.840]  and it's a real eye-opener.
[01:45:38.840 --> 01:45:39.840]  I can't stress this enough.
[01:45:39.840 --> 01:45:42.840]  You should at least watch this free video online today.
[01:45:42.840 --> 01:45:46.840]  He explains everything you need to know, including simple steps you can take to protect yourself.
[01:45:46.840 --> 01:45:50.840]  You can find the video at www.endofamerica3.com.
[01:45:50.840 --> 01:45:53.840]  That's End of America, the number 3.com.

[01:46:27.840 --> 01:46:31.840]  You'll need to be ready to act without thinking of what to do or what you need.
[01:46:31.840 --> 01:46:34.840]  You need a 5-day extreme emergency kit.
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:38.840]  With serious supplies and real food to secure to adults for 5 days,
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:46.840]  this powerful $300 extreme emergency kit is free with an order of at least $995 from eFoodsDirect.

[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:30.840]  By the way, here's the kind of news that's in my stack that I haven't gotten to.
[01:48:30.840 --> 01:48:35.840]  Headlines, schools arrange secret abortions, parents outraged,
[01:48:35.840 --> 01:48:39.840]  and they're having a straight-faced national debate in New Zealand about
[01:48:39.840 --> 01:48:44.840]  is it okay that they take 12, 13, 14, 15, 16-year-old girls
[01:48:44.840 --> 01:48:49.840]  and the school helps them get an abortion and teaches them how to not tell mommy and daddy.
[01:48:49.840 --> 01:48:54.840]  See, that's about the state running your children and carrying out the population reduction on them.
[01:48:54.840 --> 01:48:56.840]  Well, Americans don't even get mad.
[01:48:56.840 --> 01:48:58.840]  Schools all over the U.S. take kids to get abortions.
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:01.840]  And Americans say, hey, you own my kid.
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:04.840]  I'm here to produce babies for the state.
[01:49:04.840 --> 01:49:06.840]  Land of the free home of the brave.
[01:49:06.840 --> 01:49:08.840]  The TSA is like, that's right.
[01:49:08.840 --> 01:49:10.840]  We're sticking our hands on your one-year-old's pants.
[01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:11.840]  We own your family.
[01:49:11.840 --> 01:49:14.840]  Now get your wife over here, teach her to submit.
[01:49:14.840 --> 01:49:16.840]  And if you don't like her, swat team standing by.
[01:49:16.840 --> 01:49:19.840]  You better learn to submit to us.
[01:49:19.840 --> 01:49:21.840]  All right, I want to jam in some final calls.
[01:49:21.840 --> 01:49:22.840]  Finishing up with Luke.
[01:49:22.840 --> 01:49:24.840]  You're going to be traveling to Europe.
[01:49:24.840 --> 01:49:28.840]  Going to be reporting for us from Bilderberg in Switzerland.
[01:49:28.840 --> 01:49:30.840]  Doing a great job.
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:33.840]  That was big news you mentioned before the break.
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:38.840]  You say you talked to a top globalist and said you want an investigation of
[01:49:38.840 --> 01:49:41.840]  Anwar al-Awaki, the admitted number two guy,
[01:49:41.840 --> 01:49:46.840]  head of al-Qaeda, secretly hanging out at the Pentagon, getting orders,
[01:49:46.840 --> 01:49:47.840]  source Fox News.
[01:49:47.840 --> 01:49:49.840]  And did I hear you right?
[01:49:49.840 --> 01:49:51.840]  You said Herr Lieberman.
[01:49:51.840 --> 01:49:54.840]  Yeah, Senator Lieberman said he's going to look into the al-Awaki thing.
[01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:55.840]  I talked to him twice.
[01:49:55.840 --> 01:49:56.840]  Oh, yes.
[01:49:56.840 --> 01:49:59.840]  I'm going to be releasing the video later this week.
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:02.840]  Tomorrow I'm releasing an interview with prodigy of mob deep.
[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:04.840]  Alex, you've got to have this guy on your show.
[01:50:04.840 --> 01:50:05.840]  He's amazing.
[01:50:05.840 --> 01:50:08.840]  He's a Grammy award-winning hip-hop artist, a hip-hop legend.
[01:50:08.840 --> 01:50:11.840]  I'm going to also be releasing videos with Larry Flint.
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:12.840]  Right now I'm in Atlanta.
[01:50:12.840 --> 01:50:16.840]  I'm going to be speaking with Cynthia McKinney, Richard Gage, and April Gallup.
[01:50:16.840 --> 01:50:18.840]  You got an interview with Larry Flint?
[01:50:18.840 --> 01:50:21.840]  Yeah, Larry Flint actually gave me an interview down here in Washington, D.C.
[01:50:21.840 --> 01:50:24.840]  So that's going to be releasing later on this week on our YouTube channel.
[01:50:24.840 --> 01:50:27.840]  You know, I got called by his people and said you ought to put the request in.
[01:50:27.840 --> 01:50:28.840]  He might do it.
[01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:29.840]  And I never did it.
[01:50:29.840 --> 01:50:32.840]  I mean, I don't really approve of overall what's going on in the magazine,
[01:50:32.840 --> 01:50:34.840]  but it's a place to get our articles published.
[01:50:34.840 --> 01:50:39.840]  They've published a lot of a few of our infowars.com articles, but Larry Flint,
[01:50:39.840 --> 01:50:40.840]  I'd like to get him on.
[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:41.840]  I'm sorry, go ahead.
[01:50:41.840 --> 01:50:45.840]  Yeah, he's a very interesting freedom fighter as well, fighting for the First Amendment.
[01:50:45.840 --> 01:50:46.840]  But right now I'm in Atlanta.
[01:50:46.840 --> 01:50:49.840]  I'm going to be speaking at We Are Chains Atlanta's event with April Gallup,
[01:50:49.840 --> 01:50:51.840]  Cynthia McKinney, and Richard Gage.
[01:50:51.840 --> 01:50:53.840]  Next week I'm starting my Euro tour.
[01:50:53.840 --> 01:50:55.840]  I'm going to be at the G8 in France.
[01:50:55.840 --> 01:50:57.840]  I'm going to be at the Bilderberg in Switzerland.
[01:50:57.840 --> 01:51:00.840]  I'm going to be speaking for the sovereign independence in Ireland,
[01:51:00.840 --> 01:51:03.840]  Scotland, and England, and I'm going to be going all over Europe.
[01:51:03.840 --> 01:51:07.840]  People could contact me, get on my Facebook and Twitter to see exactly what I'm up to,
[01:51:07.840 --> 01:51:10.840]  but a lot of developments are breaking as they happen.
[01:51:10.840 --> 01:51:14.840]  I'm going to be there live on the scene reporting for you, for everybody else,
[01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:16.840]  and I hope people pay attention to it.
[01:51:16.840 --> 01:51:17.840]  And you gave me some bad news.
[01:51:17.840 --> 01:51:22.840]  The WeAreChange.org is being hacked where you came and keep the site up.
[01:51:22.840 --> 01:51:25.840]  I'll have to get you on the phone with my IT guys,
[01:51:25.840 --> 01:51:32.840]  but it was you who got me in contact with a well-known IT expert that found stuff that we hadn't even found.
[01:51:32.840 --> 01:51:35.840]  He hit one button and was shutting our site off just to show it.
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:39.840]  So I think we need to give you the number of the guy that you gave us,
[01:51:39.840 --> 01:51:43.840]  and he'll be able to find the holes in your system.
[01:51:43.840 --> 01:51:45.840]  Yeah, that's my friend from Federal, Jack.
[01:51:45.840 --> 01:51:47.840]  He tried to help us out.
[01:51:47.840 --> 01:51:50.840]  He even couldn't find out exactly what's happening with our website.
[01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:52.840]  So if he doesn't know, I'm kind of worried myself.
[01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:54.840]  Well, have you moved to different servers?
[01:51:54.840 --> 01:51:56.840]  Yeah, we changed servers.
[01:51:56.840 --> 01:51:59.840]  We got to find, I don't know, I got to find somebody to do this.
[01:51:59.840 --> 01:52:05.840]  Well, you're going to have to just launch on a whole other URL and a whole other platform.
[01:52:05.840 --> 01:52:08.840]  Yeah, I'm most likely going to do that, but right now people could find me on my Facebook,
[01:52:08.840 --> 01:52:10.840]  which is, you know, Luke at WeAreChange.
[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:11.840]  Hey, you know the good news?
[01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:15.840]  What, are there over 200 other chapters globally with their own websites?
[01:52:15.840 --> 01:52:18.840]  Sorry, sorry, it's already gone viral.
[01:52:18.840 --> 01:52:21.840]  You're not going to stop any of us.
[01:52:21.840 --> 01:52:25.840]  240 chapters worldwide, Alex Jones, it's insane.
[01:52:25.840 --> 01:52:29.840]  Well, I can't believe so many other people are fighting for truth and justice.
[01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:33.840]  And this is really the turning point right now, where we all take action, take steps,
[01:52:33.840 --> 01:52:37.840]  and there's going to be so many of us at the Silverbird meeting in Switzerland.
[01:52:37.840 --> 01:52:40.840]  I just can't wait to be there to bullhorn these evil criminals
[01:52:40.840 --> 01:52:42.840]  and let them know that we're not going down without a fight.
[01:52:42.840 --> 01:52:44.840]  We're not going to go down finally.
[01:52:44.840 --> 01:52:46.840]  We deserve better.
[01:52:46.840 --> 01:52:50.840]  We as humanity will prevail and they have nothing, nothing going for them.
[01:52:50.840 --> 01:52:54.840]  We have everything going for us and it's only a matter of time until we start winning.
[01:52:54.840 --> 01:52:59.840]  Well, you're just doing an incredible job, Luke, and you're inspiring countless others
[01:52:59.840 --> 01:53:01.840]  after you and they can't stop the signal.
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:02.840]  They can't stop the truth.
[01:53:02.840 --> 01:53:04.840]  They can't stop the idea.
[01:53:04.840 --> 01:53:06.840]  And Luke, God bless you.
[01:53:06.840 --> 01:53:07.840]  Great job.
[01:53:07.840 --> 01:53:09.840]  And I can't wait to have you reporting for us.
[01:53:09.840 --> 01:53:12.840]  We're going to have Jim Tucker on as well, who's got real moles inside.
[01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:16.840]  Incredible Intel coming up in June for Bilderberg.
[01:53:16.840 --> 01:53:19.840]  And we'll obviously talk to you before then.
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:23.840]  Be safe there in that den of iniquity DC.
[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:25.840]  No problem.
[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:28.840]  I'm in Atlanta right now, so I hope everybody comes out to all these events
[01:53:28.840 --> 01:53:30.840]  and checks us out and participate.
[01:53:30.840 --> 01:53:34.840]  So just get involved, get active, and become the change you want to see as well.
[01:53:34.840 --> 01:53:36.840]  Luke, you're awesome.
[01:53:36.840 --> 01:53:37.840]  We'll talk to you again soon.
[01:53:37.840 --> 01:53:40.840]  In fact, let's just put him on hold and get the IT guys to talk to him.
[01:53:40.840 --> 01:53:43.840]  But if that awesome hacker you got us in touch with can't help you.
[01:53:43.840 --> 01:53:44.840]  I don't know if we can.
[01:53:44.840 --> 01:53:47.840]  Boy, Lance in North Carolina.
[01:53:47.840 --> 01:53:48.840]  You're on the air.
[01:53:48.840 --> 01:53:54.840]  Lance, okay.
[01:53:54.840 --> 01:53:57.840]  I must have gotten a different phone system.
[01:53:57.840 --> 01:53:58.840]  Oh, that's what it is.
[01:53:58.840 --> 01:53:59.840]  It loaded.
[01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:01.840]  It loaded old phone numbers.
[01:54:01.840 --> 01:54:04.840]  Stephen, Ohio, then Peter, Timber.
[01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:05.840]  I'm going to try to get everybody.
[01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:06.840]  Steve, go ahead.
[01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:07.840]  You're on the air.
[01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:08.840]  Alex.
[01:54:08.840 --> 01:54:09.840]  Hi.
[01:54:09.840 --> 01:54:10.840]  Wanted to get with you.
[01:54:10.840 --> 01:54:12.840]  I really have a issue here.
[01:54:12.840 --> 01:54:14.840]  I wanted to ask you for some help on.
[01:54:14.840 --> 01:54:21.840]  I was really pushing information on my high school classmates Facebook.
[01:54:21.840 --> 01:54:26.840]  There's about 350 people there back in 1967, graduates.
[01:54:26.840 --> 01:54:29.840]  But more or less conservative people.
[01:54:29.840 --> 01:54:35.840]  And I was talking about Dr. Steve Pacinic and all that's been going on with the Ben
[01:54:35.840 --> 01:54:37.840]  Lawden hoax and all that.
[01:54:37.840 --> 01:54:43.840]  And what I'm confused about is I was basically posting what Dr. Pacinic said concerning the
[01:54:43.840 --> 01:54:49.840]  Marfan syndrome and made statements just mirroring what he was saying that you can't
[01:54:49.840 --> 01:54:51.840]  live more than six years with it.
[01:54:51.840 --> 01:54:54.840]  And I got kind of embarrassed because one of them.
[01:54:54.840 --> 01:54:56.840]  There's some people that have another.
[01:54:56.840 --> 01:54:58.840]  Some people can live decades.
[01:54:58.840 --> 01:55:00.840]  And I asked Pacinic about that.
[01:55:00.840 --> 01:55:01.840]  We were all talking fast.
[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:06.840]  It's the type of kidney failure he had and the Marfans on top of it.
[01:55:06.840 --> 01:55:09.840]  He was saying that he didn't think he could live very long with it.
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:10.840]  Okay.
[01:55:10.840 --> 01:55:14.840]  Well, because of people posted back, Steve, here's the Mayo Clinic websites that people
[01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:16.840]  can live normal lives with it.
[01:55:16.840 --> 01:55:17.840]  And all that sort of thing.
[01:55:17.840 --> 01:55:20.840]  I want to make one more point of it in a hurry.
[01:55:20.840 --> 01:55:27.840]  Is Alex, I know that you're expanding, but from what I see, I'm from Texas, Louisiana
[01:55:27.840 --> 01:55:28.840]  area originally.
[01:55:28.840 --> 01:55:34.840]  But from what I see up here in Ohio, I'm discouraged because the more people I talk to and I'm
[01:55:34.840 --> 01:55:39.840]  talking good people, you know, they believe everything hook, line and sinker.
[01:55:39.840 --> 01:55:45.840]  It's hard to find somebody that doesn't fall for it totally.
[01:55:45.840 --> 01:55:48.840]  Well, they're going to get hurt bad by the system.
[01:55:48.840 --> 01:55:53.840]  Almost everybody I know doesn't believe that bin Laden was just recently killed.
[01:55:53.840 --> 01:55:57.840]  I mean, the government's been caught running these hoaxes so many times in the past, Steve.
[01:55:57.840 --> 01:56:03.840]  And by the way, the whole Marfans total kidney failure, which is a separate disease, the
[01:56:03.840 --> 01:56:05.840]  Marfans is a growth disease.
[01:56:05.840 --> 01:56:10.840]  So that's probably how this is getting confused.
[01:56:10.840 --> 01:56:11.840]  Hold on.
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:13.840]  Hold on caller, because I can hear him still turned up out there.
[01:56:13.840 --> 01:56:15.840]  I'm just trying to answer your question specifically.
[01:56:15.840 --> 01:56:19.840]  But Chenek has sources in the government saying he was already dead.
[01:56:19.840 --> 01:56:21.840]  And he said this in 2002.
[01:56:21.840 --> 01:56:22.840]  Okay.
[01:56:22.840 --> 01:56:29.840]  And CBS News reported he was pretty much on his deathbed in 2001 at the American hospital
[01:56:29.840 --> 01:56:31.840]  in Dubai and also at one in Pakistan.
[01:56:31.840 --> 01:56:32.840]  Go ahead.
[01:56:32.840 --> 01:56:36.840]  Right. Well, in Bhutto that the lady in Pakistan said he was dead too.
[01:56:36.840 --> 01:56:39.840]  But the point is like these people will listen.
[01:56:39.840 --> 01:56:40.840]  They laugh at me.
[01:56:40.840 --> 01:56:42.840]  Steve, Steve, I appreciate your call.
[01:56:42.840 --> 01:56:43.840]  You're going to have to move on.
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:45.840]  They want to be hurt bad.
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:46.840]  Okay.
[01:56:46.840 --> 01:56:48.840]  They like the Federal Reserve stealing $27 trillion.
[01:56:48.840 --> 01:56:50.840]  They like Ben Bernanke laughing at him.
[01:56:50.840 --> 01:56:54.840]  They like paying for rich sports team owner stadiums.
[01:56:54.840 --> 01:56:57.840]  They like having their property taxes raised.
[01:56:57.840 --> 01:56:59.840]  They like the country being deindustrialized.
[01:56:59.840 --> 01:57:04.840]  They think it's normal to have schools inject kids with flu shots without asking.
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:05.840]  That happened two years ago.
[01:57:05.840 --> 01:57:10.840]  They think schools taking their 12-year-old daughters and cutting babies out of them is good.
[01:57:10.840 --> 01:57:15.840]  Their religion is worshiping corrupt authority.
[01:57:15.840 --> 01:57:16.840]  And so they have no future.
[01:57:16.840 --> 01:57:19.840]  And I said I'd get to Peter and Timber and Ty and everybody else.
[01:57:19.840 --> 01:57:21.840]  But I'm just out of time here.
[01:57:21.840 --> 01:57:22.840]  I apologize.
[01:57:22.840 --> 01:57:24.840]  I'll be back tomorrow at 11 a.m. Central.
[01:57:24.840 --> 01:57:27.840]  And Peter, Timber and Ty will write those names down.
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:32.840]  If you can get in tomorrow, we'll go to you first, if not next Sunday.
[01:57:32.840 --> 01:57:34.840]  It is just so frustrating, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:57:34.840 --> 01:57:35.840]  Okay.
[01:57:35.840 --> 01:57:37.840]  The gulf of talking really happened.
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:40.840]  The WMDs are in Iraq.
[01:57:40.840 --> 01:57:42.840]  Bill Clinton didn't have sex with that woman.
[01:57:42.840 --> 01:57:45.840]  And the government loves you and cares about you.
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:46.840]  And we're not even in a recession.
[01:57:46.840 --> 01:57:58.840]  The economy is great.
