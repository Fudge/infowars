[00:00:04.438 --> 00:00:08.280]  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for joining us on this June
[00:00:31.154 --> 00:00:35.415]  17th, 2010, Thursday edition.
[00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:41.057]  We're going to be live here for the next four hours.
[00:00:41.057 --> 00:00:50.279]  And part two of the interview we started last week with Lindsey Williams is coming up today due to listener request in the fourth hour.
[00:00:51.749 --> 00:01:02.556]  We're also going to be talking to a man, and I've got the charges here in my hot little hands, from We Are Change LA, who I know well, who I've interviewed before, who supplied us with powerful video.
[00:01:02.556 --> 00:01:13.802]  Bruno was in a court hearing trial and smiled and then frowned, the judge said, so he's facing terrorism charges.
[00:01:13.802 --> 00:01:18.505]  And the police manhandled him out in the foyer and then charged him with assaulting him.
[00:01:18.505 --> 00:01:20.646]  This is a standard operating procedure now.
[00:01:21.789 --> 00:01:24.031]  He's going to be popping in for about 30 minutes.
[00:01:24.031 --> 00:01:32.997]  A soon-to-be political prisoner, he'll be popping in for about 30 minutes in the middle of the third hour today from We Are Change Los Angeles.
[00:01:32.997 --> 00:01:34.138]  This could happen to anybody.
[00:01:34.138 --> 00:01:36.140]  You've all seen the countless videos.
[00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:38.642]  There was one that made national news a few months ago in Maryland.
[00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:50.291]  Where you've got some college students out walking, and police and riot gear come up and beat them half to death, and then charge them with assaulting them.
[00:01:50.291 --> 00:01:58.877]  And the teenagers, the college students, I think one was 19, one was 20, didn't even raise their arms.
[00:01:58.877 --> 00:02:05.481]  Now raising your arm to block a baton is basically a weapon of mass destruction terror attack now.
[00:02:05.481 --> 00:02:06.902]  Kind of like the Atari militias
[00:02:08.496 --> 00:02:17.583]  Gear rifles were weapons of mass destruction, well now basically raising your arm is a WMD and is just an act of high treason.
[00:02:17.583 --> 00:02:31.813]  But even if you don't raise your arm, even if you stick your chin out and say, break my jaw for no reason, you are the state, you are government, you are God, raise my taxes, rape me, take everything I've got, you are still charged with assaulting a God.
[00:02:34.707 --> 00:02:36.609]  Fuckin' Ghostbusters.
[00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:39.773]  When Zool says, are you a god?
[00:02:39.773 --> 00:02:42.596]  And they say, uh, no.
[00:02:42.596 --> 00:02:44.257]  Then die!
[00:02:45.994 --> 00:02:48.916]  Are you a government employee?
[00:02:48.916 --> 00:02:51.837]  Oh, well, actually, uh, no.
[00:02:51.837 --> 00:02:54.759]  Then die!
[00:02:54.759 --> 00:02:56.580]  Everything is ours!
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:58.821]  Government is growing!
[00:02:58.821 --> 00:03:03.964]  Like cancer racing, metastasizing to the body, nothing can stop it!
[00:03:03.964 --> 00:03:10.328]  Alright, I'm gonna try to settle down, ladies and gentlemen, excuse me.
[00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:35.013]  Well I watched Chris Matthews slimeball special last night and I've got a big list of notes here I want to comment on that I wrote while I was watching it here at the office working on a new film late we had dinner while we watched it in the coffee room and greedily ate some frozen pizzas
[00:03:37.642 --> 00:03:42.384]  Like good little slaves, all the rest of our money goes to taxes.
[00:03:42.384 --> 00:03:47.246]  We appreciate the sun shining, the grass growing, the birds tweeting thanks to government.
[00:03:47.246 --> 00:03:57.830]  But I did watch Matthew Slimeball, and it was the script, the script we got was the script, a week and a half ago, that was used in the television program, except that they did cut some of it.
[00:03:57.830 --> 00:04:01.532]  And I'm actually glad that they cut most of me out of the television show.
[00:04:03.058 --> 00:04:15.348]  I'm pleased, because it's not the type of FaceTime I'm looking for with a tiny network with half a million viewers when he's on his most highly rated programs, like Flying Bulb.
[00:04:15.348 --> 00:04:16.369]  He's one of their top shows.
[00:04:16.369 --> 00:04:18.631]  Ooh, half a million!
[00:04:18.631 --> 00:04:21.393]  Overnight, that network has about 20,000 people watching.
[00:04:21.393 --> 00:04:27.398]  You can go pull up the numbers from Nielsen and look at it for yourself.
[00:04:27.398 --> 00:04:32.422]  A small local talk station has more viewers than MSNBC on many days.
[00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.771]  But I'm glad that they actually cut me out.
[00:04:35.771 --> 00:04:38.492]  I guess they realized they were a little too liable doing it.
[00:04:38.492 --> 00:04:45.094]  The part where they go, Jones isn't calling for violence, but his supporters are probably about to shoot cops any minute.
[00:04:45.094 --> 00:04:47.435]  And that's what Jones is causing.
[00:04:47.435 --> 00:04:50.416]  Jones, he's linked to cop killing.
[00:04:50.416 --> 00:04:51.596]  That was cut out.
[00:04:51.596 --> 00:04:52.356]  And some other stuff.
[00:04:52.356 --> 00:04:54.857]  So, thank you MSNBC.
[00:04:54.857 --> 00:04:57.258]  You did retract a bit of your script.
[00:04:57.258 --> 00:04:59.339]  I wonder if it being leaked caused that to happen.
[00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.240]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.160]  Number 1.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.581]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[00:05:08.581 --> 00:05:09.441]  Number 2.
[00:05:09.441 --> 00:05:14.323]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[00:05:14.323 --> 00:05:15.063]  It's true.
[00:05:15.063 --> 00:05:19.944]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[00:05:19.944 --> 00:05:20.764]  Number 3.
[00:05:20.764 --> 00:05:24.345]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[00:05:24.345 --> 00:05:28.046]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[00:05:28.266 --> 00:05:29.066]  Number 4.
[00:05:29.066 --> 00:05:31.827]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[00:05:31.827 --> 00:05:35.508]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[00:05:35.508 --> 00:05:36.288]  Number 5.
[00:05:36.288 --> 00:05:40.429]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[00:05:40.429 --> 00:05:45.491]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.

[00:06:03.716 --> 00:06:04.977]  Tyranny is here.
[00:06:04.977 --> 00:06:08.838]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:06:08.838 --> 00:06:11.138]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:06:11.138 --> 00:06:17.000]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.242]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps now being expanded nationwide.
[00:06:23.662 --> 00:06:29.644]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:06:29.644 --> 00:06:33.825]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:06:33.825 --> 00:06:38.106]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:06:38.106 --> 00:06:44.047]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:06:44.047 --> 00:06:47.608]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:06:47.608 --> 00:06:49.589]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:06:49.589 --> 00:06:50.029]  It's here.

[00:07:52.542 --> 00:07:52.922]  Big Brother.
[00:07:52.922 --> 00:07:53.722]  Mainstream Media.
[00:08:08.244 --> 00:08:10.006]  Government cover-ups.
[00:08:10.006 --> 00:08:11.588]  You want answers?
[00:08:11.588 --> 00:08:13.129]  Well, so does he.
[00:08:13.129 --> 00:08:17.353]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[00:08:17.353 --> 00:08:24.441]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[00:08:24.441 --> 00:08:27.163]  Everyone's so upset over the foreign
[00:08:29.415 --> 00:08:37.401]  Chairman of British Petroleum, he's not American, he's not British, calling people the small people.
[00:08:37.401 --> 00:08:39.062]  What do you think the elites call you?
[00:08:39.062 --> 00:08:44.827]  They call you sub-human, bottom-feeding, useless eaters.
[00:08:44.827 --> 00:08:52.532]  What do you think Ted Turner, back in 1996, called you at the press club?
[00:08:52.532 --> 00:08:58.117]  Years previous to that, at the press dinner, the White House press dinner, called you useless eaters.
[00:08:59.053 --> 00:09:00.954]  Useless feeders.
[00:09:00.954 --> 00:09:03.215]  I mean, what do you think they're calling you?
[00:09:03.215 --> 00:09:05.776]  What do you think they think of you?
[00:09:05.776 --> 00:09:16.761]  They think you're a bunch of gullible, weak, soft, easily manipulated scum who are eating up their resources and that need to get off their planet.
[00:09:16.761 --> 00:09:18.542]  That's what the elite thinks of you.
[00:09:18.542 --> 00:09:24.505]  So everyone's mad at some foreigner who can barely speak English going, I'm very sorry for the small people.
[00:09:24.505 --> 00:09:26.426]  I know the oil is hurting you.
[00:09:29.858 --> 00:09:33.060]  Why is it okay to call somebody little people?
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:33.960]  The little man.
[00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:36.242]  But don't call you the small man.
[00:09:36.242 --> 00:09:43.766]  Yeah, the government can take more than half of the average person's salary in one tax or another.
[00:09:43.766 --> 00:09:47.968]  Oh yeah, you're a blue-collar worker, you're paying around half.
[00:09:47.968 --> 00:09:48.749]  In one way or the other.
[00:09:48.749 --> 00:09:54.372]  They put out all these fake news statistics about, oh, right at half the American people pay no tax.
[00:09:54.372 --> 00:09:55.672]  Baloney!
[00:09:55.672 --> 00:09:56.253]  Baloney!
[00:09:58.277 --> 00:10:04.514]  You get paid less because your employer has to pay a bunch of taxes and has to match your FICA and Social Security.
[00:10:06.943 --> 00:10:11.406]  You're paying around 15 to 20 percent, depending on your tax rate right there.
[00:10:11.406 --> 00:10:21.011]  Then there's all the local taxes, and the sales taxes, and all the communications taxes, and all the environmental taxes, on and on and on and on.
[00:10:21.011 --> 00:10:26.694]  And now they want value-added taxes, and financial VATs, and carbon taxes.
[00:10:26.694 --> 00:10:30.196]  Oh, that'll fix BP that's spent more than $10 million.
[00:10:31.806 --> 00:10:36.407]  In the last decade, Hans showing Global Carbon Tax Initiative.
[00:10:36.407 --> 00:10:46.070]  And so now they're going to take $20 billion of pension fund money, put it in a hedge fund, invest it, and supposedly take the profits.
[00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:47.831]  It's kind of like a lottery.
[00:10:47.831 --> 00:10:52.692]  Oh, you get $5 million over the next 30 years.
[00:10:52.692 --> 00:10:54.433]  Paid out in payments.
[00:10:54.433 --> 00:10:56.614]  It's the same thing.
[00:10:56.614 --> 00:10:57.594]  And the media
[00:10:58.857 --> 00:11:00.358]  Left-wing, right-wing, it doesn't matter.
[00:11:00.358 --> 00:11:06.042]  The controlled media is saying this is the biggest issue in world history.
[00:11:06.042 --> 00:11:07.803]  They're saying it's revelations.
[00:11:07.803 --> 00:11:13.066]  Wormwood and the ocean turned to blood and a third of the creatures in it died.
[00:11:13.066 --> 00:11:15.828]  And everyone's running around quoting revelations.
[00:11:15.828 --> 00:11:16.869]  It's the end!
[00:11:16.869 --> 00:11:17.809]  It's the end!
[00:11:17.809 --> 00:11:21.972]  They've had oil spills in the Middle East three times bigger than this.
[00:11:21.972 --> 00:11:24.574]  They've had oil spills in Indonesia twice as large as this.
[00:11:26.032 --> 00:11:36.608]  Three years ago, they had one as big as this in the Gulf of Mexico, off the coast of Mexico, and it wasn't an issue.
[00:11:36.608 --> 00:11:38.490]  Oh, it hurt some of the fishing.
[00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:41.495]  It hurt some of the locals, but Mexico didn't even ban their people fishing it.
[00:11:42.776 --> 00:11:46.499]  Crude oil is not that toxic compared to the chemicals they're using to disperse it.
[00:11:46.499 --> 00:11:50.202]  Crude oil is highly biodegradable.
[00:11:50.202 --> 00:11:51.663]  Is it gonna kill some manatees?
[00:11:51.663 --> 00:11:56.047]  Which, I like those sea cows, they're cute little sweet creatures, re-entrants.
[00:11:56.047 --> 00:11:58.089]  Yes, it's too bad.
[00:11:58.089 --> 00:11:59.170]  Is it killing a lot of dolphins?
[00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:00.130]  Yes.
[00:12:00.130 --> 00:12:06.736]  But you go down to the Gulf Coast, dolphins are like... mullet.
[00:12:06.736 --> 00:12:07.697]  Or hardheads.
[00:12:07.697 --> 00:12:08.918]  I mean, they're just everywhere.
[00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:18.296]  By the way, to talk about how ignorant people are, three or four months ago I was down at the beach and I was walking at night.
[00:12:18.296 --> 00:12:27.504]  I'd gone for a jog at sunset and I was coming back and some yuppies were coming out of their beach house, actually beach house condominiums, and I was walking in the dark.
[00:12:29.022 --> 00:12:29.342]  I don't know.
[00:12:52.566 --> 00:13:06.190]  And you know it was like three yuppie guys and three yuppie ladies and I thought they were joking and then they were kind of bowing up and I was literally 10 feet from them in the dark by the beach and there were cars driving by and stuff and I didn't understand.
[00:13:06.190 --> 00:13:17.913]  I guess because they had an adrenaline rush seeing me in the dark they decided I must be bad and you know I was wearing jogging shoes, jogging shorts, jogging shirt and
[00:13:19.392 --> 00:13:21.713]  I said, hey, you want to go down to the jetty?
[00:13:21.713 --> 00:13:23.094]  It was about a mile and a half away.
[00:13:23.094 --> 00:13:26.616]  I said, there's a bunch of green sea turtles down there and dolphins.
[00:13:26.616 --> 00:13:27.516]  And the woman laughed.
[00:13:27.516 --> 00:13:30.398]  She said, there's no dolphins in these waters.
[00:13:30.398 --> 00:13:31.998]  It's too hot.
[00:13:31.998 --> 00:13:36.621]  I guess she thought whales are only in the Atlantic, only in northern climes.
[00:13:36.621 --> 00:13:40.563]  They don't know there's equatorial mammals.
[00:13:41.977 --> 00:13:42.578]  Whales.
[00:13:42.578 --> 00:13:43.498]  Dolphins.
[00:13:43.498 --> 00:13:44.499]  Subgroup of whales.
[00:13:44.499 --> 00:13:45.960]  I don't know why I'm digressing.
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:47.862]  I just had a flashback to this.
[00:13:47.862 --> 00:13:48.662]  I didn't argue with her.
[00:13:48.662 --> 00:13:53.066]  I shut up and, uh, just, because I'd stopped running.
[00:13:53.066 --> 00:14:01.713]  I'd, you know, it was about 100 yards to the beach house, so I started walking and I just kind of put my head down and started walking and heard the men making powerful grunting noises.
[00:14:01.713 --> 00:14:03.814]  They had driven off the enemy.
[00:14:03.814 --> 00:14:10.900]  See, there's all these facsimiles or all these shadows of men and shadows of women.
[00:14:12.659 --> 00:14:24.184]  Guys will bow up to somebody who walks up to the Kerr's Light area at the grocery store, and if some guy kind of butts in front of him to get the Kerr's Light, he might have a word with him.
[00:14:24.184 --> 00:14:30.566]  Or if somebody's walking through the dark after sunset on the beach, people get scared, they'll bow up.
[00:14:30.566 --> 00:14:34.228]  Or a guy will sit there with his Harley Davidson, revving it, looking at the
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:47.467]  The weak guy driving the minivan next to him and he'll stare at him with a powerful look on his face and let him know that he's wearing his biker jacket and you better watch it, little man.
[00:14:47.467 --> 00:14:51.310]  I'm not bashing people who like biker jackets and Harleys.
[00:14:51.310 --> 00:15:01.256]  I like Harleys and I think the biker culture is cool and I understand it, but the point is, that's not your manhood.
[00:15:01.256 --> 00:15:05.099]  Your manhood is being aware and being involved and
[00:15:06.678 --> 00:15:20.491]  Not being scared of guns, and not being scared of freedom, and not being scared of property rights, and not being scared of national sovereignty, and not being scared of political correctness to the point of you won't speak up and get involved.
[00:15:20.491 --> 00:15:23.114]  That's what's important.
[00:15:23.114 --> 00:15:25.096]  That's what's patriotic.
[00:15:25.096 --> 00:15:27.038]  Not acting cool all day.
[00:15:30.216 --> 00:15:39.281]  But the point is, the Gulf Coast is just filled with big ol' green sea turtles and dolphins.
[00:15:39.281 --> 00:15:46.785]  You can go down there to say Port Aransas and stand any time of day on the jetties and there are just dolphins everywhere.
[00:15:46.785 --> 00:15:48.065]  Everywhere!
[00:15:48.065 --> 00:15:52.828]  To the point of, they're so overpopulated, it's destroying the fishing in the area.
[00:15:52.828 --> 00:15:55.289]  Because the dolphins are just gobbling everything up.
[00:15:55.289 --> 00:15:58.571]  So, it's a terrible thing that this oil is out there.
[00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:02.342]  But it is a distraction.
[00:16:02.342 --> 00:16:07.046]  It is a distraction.
[00:16:09.286 --> 00:16:29.598]  It is a diversion from the fact that the UN is set to vote on crippling sanctions that will include an embargo, a blockade of Iran and goods coming into the country, non-military, which is under every charter historically and under current law an act of war.
[00:16:30.979 --> 00:16:38.786]  And Iran is saying they will start boarding international ships, which will be an act of war, and it is off to the races.
[00:16:38.786 --> 00:16:45.892]  World War III is in preparation publicly right now with Iran.
[00:16:45.892 --> 00:16:50.036]  And this will not go like Afghanistan and Iraq.
[00:16:52.082 --> 00:17:05.010]  And we've got a public so timid that if you try to talk to most of your neighbors, they don't want to talk to you because they want to go in and watch SportsCenter or they want to go in and take their Prozac or drink their beer or live in their own little world.
[00:17:05.010 --> 00:17:20.020]  We live in a country that's so strange that Americans are scared on the beach at night and will not talk to fellow citizens about dolphins and turtles and think it's weird if you try to talk to them back when they talk to you.
[00:17:21.175 --> 00:17:30.159]  We live in a country so in its comfort zone that the average American is scared of a gun.
[00:17:30.159 --> 00:17:37.122]  This is not the spirit.
[00:17:37.122 --> 00:17:41.123]  This is not the attitude that is going to save the country.
[00:17:41.123 --> 00:17:47.766]  A timid crouch down and lick the hand that feeds you forget that you are our countryman.
[00:17:48.988 --> 00:17:50.229]  We need to be angry.
[00:17:50.229 --> 00:17:54.052]  That's why the media always says, oh, don't criticize anything the government's doing.
[00:17:54.052 --> 00:17:59.236]  Don't criticize all the communist rallies going on around the country, funded by the government.
[00:17:59.236 --> 00:18:02.378]  Don't criticize that, or you must be a racist.
[00:18:02.378 --> 00:18:10.305]  That's meant to make you sit down and shut up.
[00:18:10.305 --> 00:18:13.207]  You're meant to be timid.
[00:18:13.207 --> 00:18:14.328]  You're meant to be cowardly.
[00:18:15.779 --> 00:18:19.843]  You're meant to be scared to talk about anything but what is acceptable.
[00:18:19.843 --> 00:18:23.147]  And what does the media say is acceptable?
[00:18:23.147 --> 00:18:31.755]  You're allowed to talk about sports, and you're allowed to talk about the weather, and I catch myself even doing it.
[00:18:31.755 --> 00:18:34.838]  If somebody starts trying to talk to me at the park, and they go past the weather, I
[00:18:38.365 --> 00:18:49.508]  Don't want to talk to him because usually I'm already thinking about something and we're so busy in our daily lives and there's so much going on in our minds that that we just want to do what's safe.
[00:18:49.508 --> 00:18:53.249]  But I tell you more and more I break my conditioning.
[00:18:53.249 --> 00:19:00.331]  I was in a CVS pharmacy driving home Sunday and I go up to the counter and the woman
[00:19:02.441 --> 00:19:05.422]  Starts pushing flu shots on me.
[00:19:05.422 --> 00:19:09.823]  Now I know full well that it was a hoax from the beginning and now it's admitted it was a hoax.
[00:19:09.823 --> 00:19:19.806]  I know full well that for two months even the government said there's no need to take the shot anymore because the H1N1 non-event pandemic, the hoax, is over.
[00:19:20.706 --> 00:19:23.329]  But the woman said, would you like an H1N1 shot?
[00:19:23.329 --> 00:19:25.993]  We have specials on them, getting rid of their inventory, of course.
[00:19:25.993 --> 00:19:28.716]  And I didn't go through that speech with her, and I said, no, thank you.
[00:19:28.716 --> 00:19:29.838]  Do you want a CVS card?
[00:19:29.838 --> 00:19:31.900]  And I said, no, thank you, pushing a tracking card.
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.265]  And then she said, do you want to give money to Lou Gehrig's disease?
[00:19:35.265 --> 00:19:35.645]  A dollar?
[00:19:36.266 --> 00:19:37.147]  And I said, no thank you.
[00:19:37.147 --> 00:19:39.709]  And she gave me a condescending look and smacked her lips.
[00:19:39.709 --> 00:19:41.490]  And I said, listen lady.
[00:19:41.490 --> 00:19:47.094]  I said, that H1N1 shot you want to push on me is linked to Lou Gehrig's disease and Guillain-Barré's.
[00:19:47.094 --> 00:19:51.977]  And she rolled her eyes and I said, with my son standing right next to me, I said, it's on the insert.
[00:19:51.977 --> 00:19:53.739]  It causes neurological disorders.
[00:19:53.739 --> 00:19:56.140]  Don't smack your lips at me!
[00:19:56.140 --> 00:19:57.741]  And I raised my voice.
[00:19:57.741 --> 00:19:58.902]  And then I started preaching at her!
[00:20:00.882 --> 00:20:01.223]  Fact.
[00:20:01.223 --> 00:20:02.805]  4 million people in the U.S.
[00:20:02.805 --> 00:20:04.928]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[00:20:04.928 --> 00:20:05.448]  Fact.
[00:20:05.448 --> 00:20:09.153]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the 8th leading cause of death among Americans.
[00:20:09.153 --> 00:20:09.754]  Fact.
[00:20:09.754 --> 00:20:15.281]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[00:20:15.281 --> 00:20:15.562]  Fact.
[00:20:15.882 --> 00:20:20.085]  One in 10 Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[00:20:20.085 --> 00:20:24.648]  Fact, anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[00:21:00.814 --> 00:21:02.535]  Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[00:21:02.535 --> 00:21:02.835]  June 17, 2010.
[00:21:02.835 --> 00:21:03.916]  Gold opened this morning at $1238.40.

[00:21:06.959 --> 00:21:07.439]  That's $1271.33, $635.66, or $317.83.
[00:21:19.884 --> 00:21:22.766]  Making the right decision is a challenge to investors.
[00:21:22.766 --> 00:21:27.029]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or worse, depression?
[00:21:27.029 --> 00:21:31.912]  Many investors are turning to gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[00:21:31.912 --> 00:21:35.694]  Midas has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold.

[00:22:04.907 --> 00:22:06.168]  Tyranny is here.
[00:22:06.168 --> 00:22:09.870]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[00:22:09.870 --> 00:22:12.332]  It really says that the state is God.
[00:22:12.332 --> 00:22:18.196]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[00:22:18.196 --> 00:22:24.420]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[00:22:24.855 --> 00:22:30.818]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[00:22:30.818 --> 00:22:35.020]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our republic has fallen.
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:39.302]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[00:22:39.302 --> 00:22:45.265]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[00:22:45.265 --> 00:22:48.806]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[00:22:48.806 --> 00:22:50.207]  The police state isn't coming.
[00:22:50.769 --> 00:22:51.870]  It's here.

[00:23:00.157 --> 00:23:03.540]  When you hear the words water purification, what comes to mind?
[00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:07.443]  If it's Berkey Water Purification Systems, this message is for you.
[00:23:07.443 --> 00:23:11.166]  Did you know that over 60% of municipal water contains fluoride?
[00:23:11.166 --> 00:23:17.872]  At less than 2 cents per gallon, Berkey water filters purify treated and untreated water, remove dangerous chlorine, fluoride,

[00:24:04.346 --> 00:24:06.167]  Alright, here's what I'm going to do.
[00:24:06.167 --> 00:24:17.575]  If you want to talk about the ridiculous propaganda piece demonizing the Tea Parties last night that aired three times and is going to air again today and throughout the week over and over again.
[00:24:17.575 --> 00:24:22.398]  A network with pathetic ratings like they have has to air something over and over again to have any effect.
[00:24:23.524 --> 00:24:38.778]  You're welcome to call in on that subject, your take on the BP ongoing, Day 65, 66, I forget, and the aftermath of that, and Obama pushing for his global carbon tax, and a wellhead tax, a gas tax, so many taxes.
[00:24:39.892 --> 00:24:41.593]  Who can keep count?
[00:24:41.593 --> 00:24:53.541]  If you wish to discuss the FCC, the Federal Trade Commission, there's three or four new articles today up on the Drudge Report about it, openly calling for censorship of the internet and free speech.
[00:24:53.541 --> 00:25:00.907]  If you want to discuss the continued financial meltdown, the horrible jobless numbers that came out, gold blasting back to all-time highs.
[00:25:01.887 --> 00:25:08.630]  Today, after the establishment failed to suppress it, the toll-free number to join us on air is 1-800-259-9231.
[00:25:08.630 --> 00:25:10.291]  Let's start running through the news.
[00:25:16.670 --> 00:25:22.834]  Prosecutors want gag order on Blagojevich, defense lawyers say, Chicago Tribune.
[00:25:22.834 --> 00:25:24.656]  Well, of course they do!
[00:25:24.656 --> 00:25:34.863]  It's on record that he worked with Rahm Emanuel, that he came up under Axelrod as one of the protégés of Axelrod.
[00:25:34.863 --> 00:25:37.685]  Axelrod is their kingpin.
[00:25:37.685 --> 00:25:41.067]  And then, of course, above them is Mob Boss Daley.
[00:25:41.067 --> 00:25:42.228]  I mean, Chicago!
[00:25:42.228 --> 00:25:45.871]  No one debates that Chicago is full of great people and great pizza.
[00:25:47.174 --> 00:25:50.777]  But at the same time, it is Mafia Center USA.
[00:25:50.777 --> 00:25:54.199]  You don't get any more corrupt than the big city machine.
[00:25:54.199 --> 00:25:57.761]  And it's time to kick it out.
[00:25:57.761 --> 00:26:00.683]  And the bigger they are, the harder they fall.
[00:26:00.683 --> 00:26:11.631]  It's on record, of course we reported this a year and a half ago, when Obama won the presidency, but now it's mainline news that for years, as a congressman,
[00:26:13.595 --> 00:26:29.300]  And then, of course, as a Senator, both Senator Obama and House Member Rahm Emanuel had their homes paid for, not just in Chicago, but in D.C.
[00:26:29.300 --> 00:26:37.043]  by companies like, well, one of them, a big lobbyist for BP, they paid for the House
[00:26:38.439 --> 00:26:39.719]  For years.
[00:26:39.719 --> 00:26:46.341]  The million-dollar-plus-a-year apartment condo of the White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel.
[00:26:46.341 --> 00:26:51.202]  And then, of course, Goldman Sachs and others paying for things for Obama.
[00:26:51.202 --> 00:26:55.643]  I mean, that is illegal on its face.
[00:26:55.643 --> 00:26:57.883]  On its face, it is illegal.
[00:26:57.883 --> 00:26:59.723]  They should be indicted right now.
[00:26:59.723 --> 00:27:02.184]  But don't forget who they've got as the Attorney General.
[00:27:02.184 --> 00:27:07.125]  He was the Deputy Attorney General under Harry Clinton, and the butcher of Waco, Janet
[00:27:08.194 --> 00:27:20.862]  Reno and Janet Reno, who on record was blackmailing Clinton the entire time with all of his crimes, was able to basically get away with murder, including murder at Waco.
[00:27:20.862 --> 00:27:25.745]  But government involvement in the murder, not suicide, of Vince Foster.
[00:27:25.745 --> 00:27:28.707]  This is a mafia crew.
[00:27:28.707 --> 00:27:30.748]  They enjoy heist.
[00:27:30.748 --> 00:27:32.449]  They enjoy bravado.
[00:27:32.449 --> 00:27:33.970]  They enjoy hubris.
[00:27:33.970 --> 00:27:36.272]  They enjoy the bold moves.
[00:27:37.478 --> 00:27:41.060]  And so Blagojevich has been trying to get all the tapes released.
[00:27:41.060 --> 00:27:49.004]  The government's like, no, no, no, because on those tapes is Axelrod and Emanuel and Barry Sitaro and all of them.
[00:27:49.004 --> 00:27:51.585]  And it's on record that they're in the tapes.
[00:27:51.585 --> 00:27:53.326]  How do you think this works?
[00:27:53.326 --> 00:27:56.148]  This is Chicago!
[00:27:56.148 --> 00:27:58.229]  And Goldman Sachs and others said, hey,
[00:28:00.148 --> 00:28:01.168]  We love this model.
[00:28:01.168 --> 00:28:04.109]  We want a Chicago crew.
[00:28:04.109 --> 00:28:06.009]  These guys will get the job done.
[00:28:06.009 --> 00:28:08.870]  The globalist mafia sitting in New York and D.C.
[00:28:08.870 --> 00:28:13.070]  said, hey, we got some good boys there in Chicago.
[00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:15.091]  Oh, they're ruthless, they're bold.
[00:28:15.091 --> 00:28:17.931]  Let's get them in right now.
[00:28:17.931 --> 00:28:19.572]  Look at the foolish public.
[00:28:19.572 --> 00:28:22.892]  They think they're getting rid of Bush, who we owned.
[00:28:22.892 --> 00:28:24.913]  Now we're putting in our man Obama.
[00:28:24.913 --> 00:28:26.613]  We got so much dirt on him.
[00:28:27.796 --> 00:28:33.240]  And when we're done with him in four to eight years, depending on how long, how much these schmucks out there buy.
[00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:36.002]  Look at all these stupid people, hoping change.
[00:28:36.002 --> 00:28:38.504]  Oh yeah, you're gonna get a lot of change.
[00:28:38.504 --> 00:28:41.145]  We own all the horses in the race.
[00:28:41.145 --> 00:28:45.328]  Let me tell you, our guy Don King, he owns both the fighters.
[00:28:45.328 --> 00:28:50.492]  But the idiots, they still pay 50, 60, 100 dollars for pay-per-view.
[00:28:50.492 --> 00:28:53.094]  And they tune in and they watch a rig fight.
[00:28:53.094 --> 00:28:55.315]  Just like they watch the rig ponies.
[00:28:55.315 --> 00:28:56.756]  Just like they go to Vegas.
[00:28:58.237 --> 00:28:59.738]  Oh, look at the schmucks.
[00:28:59.738 --> 00:29:01.619]  There's nothing they won't put up with.
[00:29:01.619 --> 00:29:04.300]  There's nothing they won't go along with.
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.401]  There's nothing they won't buy.
[00:29:06.401 --> 00:29:14.905]  Soon all of America is going to be like Chicago, where our people run things, where they're disarmed, where we own the cops, we own the courts.
[00:29:14.905 --> 00:29:19.787]  We're going to take everybody's property because this country is ready to be pushed over.
[00:29:19.787 --> 00:29:21.408]  It's like a great big
[00:29:22.948 --> 00:29:26.330]  Mud pie, and we're pigs that are gonna wade into it.
[00:29:26.330 --> 00:29:28.291]  Tony Montana would say something else.
[00:29:28.291 --> 00:29:29.792]  This sounds like a great big.
[00:29:29.792 --> 00:29:30.832]  But you know what?
[00:29:30.832 --> 00:29:32.473]  I'm not gonna say it here.
[00:29:32.473 --> 00:29:36.955]  The point is, this country's ready to be brought down right now.
[00:29:36.955 --> 00:29:42.257]  These cowards, all they wanna do is watch their football, their baseball, their World Cup.
[00:29:42.257 --> 00:29:43.038]  That's good.
[00:29:43.038 --> 00:29:48.640]  You watch that like little kids, while the men steal everything you got.
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.981]  Good job, Blagojevich.
[00:29:50.501 --> 00:29:54.403]  We're on the march, the Empire's on the run.
[00:29:54.403 --> 00:30:00.505]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[00:30:00.505 --> 00:30:03.526]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[00:30:03.526 --> 00:30:08.868]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[00:30:08.868 --> 00:30:10.909]  My answer would be all I can get.
[00:30:10.909 --> 00:30:15.911]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[00:30:15.911 --> 00:30:17.092]  How much do you want?
[00:30:17.092 --> 00:30:17.832]  When do you want it?
[00:30:18.212 --> 00:30:20.094]  Now or after the battle starts?
[00:30:20.094 --> 00:30:21.155]  When will you need it?
[00:30:21.155 --> 00:30:23.376]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[00:30:23.376 --> 00:30:24.698]  Will there be any food?
[00:30:24.698 --> 00:30:26.239]  Will it make your children sick?
[00:30:26.239 --> 00:30:31.503]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[00:30:31.503 --> 00:30:34.626]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[00:30:35.086 --> 00:30:38.907]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[00:30:38.907 --> 00:30:40.127]  How much will you need?
[00:30:40.127 --> 00:30:41.027]  We don't know.
[00:30:41.027 --> 00:30:42.128]  How much do you want?
[00:30:42.128 --> 00:30:43.068]  All you can get.
[00:30:43.068 --> 00:30:44.168]  I'm Alex Jones.
[00:30:44.168 --> 00:30:47.209]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[00:30:47.209 --> 00:30:48.989]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.

[00:32:47.409 --> 00:32:48.270]  Don't want no shackles
[00:33:16.710 --> 00:33:19.291]  You don't want no shackles on me.
[00:33:19.291 --> 00:33:21.573]  You don't want no shackles on you, huh, Bob?
[00:33:21.573 --> 00:33:23.674]  How about I break your legs?
[00:33:23.674 --> 00:33:25.935]  That'll teach ya!
[00:33:25.935 --> 00:33:28.397]  The shackles is called government.
[00:33:28.397 --> 00:33:31.038]  We run the big central banks and the brokerage houses.
[00:33:31.038 --> 00:33:32.179]  We're gonna take your money.
[00:33:32.179 --> 00:33:35.601]  If you don't like it, your wife and kids are dead.
[00:33:35.601 --> 00:33:37.281]  The SWAT teams work for us now.
[00:33:41.758 --> 00:33:44.299]  And of course, down in the South, they got the boss hoax.
[00:33:44.299 --> 00:33:45.059]  That's right!
[00:33:45.059 --> 00:33:47.479]  We run this county and this state!
[00:33:47.479 --> 00:33:49.580]  We're gonna take anything we want!
[00:33:49.580 --> 00:33:51.620]  Hehehehehe!
[00:33:51.620 --> 00:33:56.381]  Again, it's time for the American people to stand up against this tyranny.
[00:33:56.381 --> 00:34:04.563]  So Blagojevich, he was just standard operating procedure, going, listen, Mac, I'm gonna need some money for these appointments.
[00:34:04.563 --> 00:34:06.163]  You understand how it works here?
[00:34:07.156 --> 00:34:08.457]  Chicago Tribune!
[00:34:08.457 --> 00:34:10.979]  Prosecutors want gag order on Blagojevich!
[00:34:10.979 --> 00:34:12.260]  Defense lawyers!
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:26.971]  Federal prosecutors are seeking a gag order to keep ex-governor Rod Blagojevich and his lawyers from making public comments saying Blagojevich has attempted to manipulate media coverage to gain favorable attention and influence the jury in his corruption case.
[00:34:26.971 --> 00:34:30.634]  And they're blocking him from bringing out all the tapes.
[00:34:30.634 --> 00:34:32.876]  Which, of course, implicate the establishment.
[00:34:32.876 --> 00:34:35.117]  Here's another one.
[00:34:35.117 --> 00:34:35.818]  Another headline.
[00:34:40.066 --> 00:34:44.169]  Blago Defense Tries to Link Kickback to Obama Contribution.
[00:34:44.169 --> 00:34:50.853]  That's out of the Chicago Tribune as well.
[00:34:50.853 --> 00:34:53.215]  No, the Chicago Machine?
[00:34:53.215 --> 00:34:59.959]  I mean, it's come out that Resco and others paid for his house in Chicago, half price.
[00:34:59.959 --> 00:35:02.621]  Oh, you want a million dollar house for $400,000?
[00:35:02.621 --> 00:35:04.002]  It's yours, pal.
[00:35:04.002 --> 00:35:05.883]  We're only sucking it off the little people.
[00:35:07.056 --> 00:35:18.660]  That's plenty of money to go around for you, a good CIA officer, a community organizer with the Ford Foundation, with the Rockefellers.
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:27.963]  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, I want to go to your phone calls because you notice I just spent the last segment, part of this segment, on one story.
[00:35:27.963 --> 00:35:29.323]  And here's the type of headlines I have.
[00:35:29.323 --> 00:35:31.204]  Prosecutors want gag order on Blagojevich.
[00:35:32.842 --> 00:35:37.204]  Meanwhile, a woman pleads guilty to accessing Obama student loan records.
[00:35:37.204 --> 00:35:39.124]  Oh yeah, they're watching those like a hawk.
[00:35:39.124 --> 00:35:44.166]  You try to find out about Barry Sitaro, that's what his name is in the records, you're going to prison.
[00:35:44.166 --> 00:35:47.847]  Oh, you release footage of our troops massacring people?
[00:35:47.847 --> 00:35:53.309]  You're going to prison.
[00:35:53.309 --> 00:35:55.390]  You try to expose corruption?
[00:35:55.390 --> 00:35:56.971]  You're going to prison.
[00:35:56.971 --> 00:35:59.432]  You report a government crime that's been committed?
[00:35:59.432 --> 00:36:00.152]  You go to prison.
[00:36:02.591 --> 00:36:11.274]  Meanwhile, there's all these new big cash bonuses for turning in your neighbors for petty supposed crimes, tattling on your neighbors, lying about your neighbors.
[00:36:11.274 --> 00:36:20.757]  The feds are in there training the general public how to be informants, how to lie on the stand, because there's a lot of cash, a lot of money, a lot of power robbing and stealing.
[00:36:20.757 --> 00:36:24.539]  So what if society collapses?
[00:36:24.539 --> 00:36:27.860]  Tea Party Group calls on sponsors to drop hardball.
[00:36:29.773 --> 00:36:31.994]  Well, I mean, the sponsors aren't going to drop.
[00:36:31.994 --> 00:36:35.477]  I mean, it's all defense contractors, drug companies, and others.
[00:36:35.477 --> 00:36:41.921]  They know they don't get a response being on MSNBC with half a million viewers on their top shows.
[00:36:41.921 --> 00:36:42.741]  They understand that.
[00:36:42.741 --> 00:36:45.923]  You know, what's an ad on MSNBC?
[00:36:45.923 --> 00:36:48.665]  $20,000 for 60 seconds.
[00:36:48.665 --> 00:36:58.952]  Meanwhile, you could go buy that ad for, say, $1,000 on something like Coast to Coast AM and reach 3 million people in a 15-minute listening time.
[00:36:59.617 --> 00:37:02.439]  On average, about 3 million tuned in in any 15-minute segment.
[00:37:02.439 --> 00:37:08.442]  About 9 to 10 million, depending on the week, tuning in at night.
[00:37:08.442 --> 00:37:10.723]  16 million a week overall or more.
[00:37:10.723 --> 00:37:17.047]  But no, you'd rather spend $20,000 on MSNBC with half a million watching.
[00:37:17.047 --> 00:37:18.388]  See, it's all a scam.
[00:37:18.388 --> 00:37:20.369]  Oh, you want three lines in a newspaper.
[00:37:20.369 --> 00:37:25.091]  We've run ads in the Statesman and gotten zero response.
[00:37:25.091 --> 00:37:25.472]  Zero.
[00:37:26.325 --> 00:37:32.748]  For a part-time nanny, for a part-time housekeeper to come once a week, you know, clean the house.
[00:37:32.748 --> 00:37:34.369]  No response!
[00:37:34.369 --> 00:37:36.390]  Zero!
[00:37:36.390 --> 00:37:38.612]  Zero!
[00:37:38.612 --> 00:37:45.355]  We've run ads in the Statesman for people to have job applicants for this office.
[00:37:45.355 --> 00:37:46.276]  Two or three phone calls.
[00:37:48.356 --> 00:37:52.178]  Can't speak English, because I guess the illegal aliens aren't online or something.
[00:37:52.178 --> 00:37:53.438]  Or as many of them aren't.
[00:37:53.438 --> 00:37:57.280]  You put an ad in Craigslist for a nanny, hundreds of responses.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:04.542]  You put an ad in Craigslist for somebody to work in slash radio, TV, hundreds of responses.
[00:38:04.542 --> 00:38:05.823]  Incredibly qualified.
[00:38:07.230 --> 00:38:08.891]  Craigslist is free.
[00:38:08.891 --> 00:38:11.694]  The statesman for two lines is 300 bucks.
[00:38:11.694 --> 00:38:13.655]  It's all a fraud.
[00:38:13.655 --> 00:38:15.177]  All a hoax.
[00:38:15.177 --> 00:38:16.878]  All a scam.
[00:38:16.878 --> 00:38:18.560]  MSNBC's a scam.
[00:38:18.560 --> 00:38:20.521]  The Austin American Statesman's a scam.
[00:38:20.521 --> 00:38:23.164]  It's a joke.
[00:38:23.164 --> 00:38:25.205]  It's a fraud.
[00:38:25.205 --> 00:38:26.146]  It's a laughing matter.
[00:38:26.146 --> 00:38:31.150]  $200 to advertise on my radio show for an ad. $200!
[00:38:34.224 --> 00:38:42.690]  For the amount of people you reach, the way the market is, you should be paying about $5,000.
[00:38:42.690 --> 00:38:48.635]  Conservatively, a half million people listening every 15 minutes.
[00:38:48.635 --> 00:38:51.117]  That's conservatively.
[00:38:51.117 --> 00:38:55.040]  Just on AM and FM.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:39:01.404]  We have more listeners every 15 minutes than Chris Matthews' entire show.
[00:39:01.404 --> 00:39:01.865]  We're 200, he's 20,000.
[00:39:04.352 --> 00:39:05.453]  Again, I'm already digressing.
[00:39:05.453 --> 00:39:06.054]  That's what I mean.
[00:39:06.054 --> 00:39:07.695]  Everything is a fraud.
[00:39:07.695 --> 00:39:08.996]  Everything is a scam.
[00:39:08.996 --> 00:39:12.259]  It's a giant, propped up, rotten illusion.
[00:39:12.259 --> 00:39:24.791]  And if you just get your hackles up, if you just get your hair up, if you get angry, if you get fired up and never stop and realize you're committed and you're not gonna stop exposing the New World Order and you're not gonna stop
[00:39:25.231 --> 00:39:33.933]  Supporting alternative media and you're not going to stop pointing your finger at the government saying you're a bunch of lawless New York crime machine, Chicago crime machine.
[00:39:33.933 --> 00:39:34.873]  That's who took over.
[00:39:34.873 --> 00:39:37.994]  The New York crime machine and Chicago crime machine.
[00:39:37.994 --> 00:39:46.335]  You know who invented controlling local city governments and having governments invest money in fake schemes?
[00:39:46.335 --> 00:39:48.616]  Al Capone did 80 plus years ago.
[00:39:49.690 --> 00:39:59.197]  He would go down and hang out with the Rockefeller family in Hot Springs, Arkansas and gamble for months and have sex with two, three hookers a day.
[00:39:59.197 --> 00:40:02.299]  That's on record.
[00:40:02.299 --> 00:40:03.900]  Al Capone worked with the Rockefellers.
[00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:05.581]  They would hang out in Hot Springs, Arkansas.
[00:40:05.581 --> 00:40:07.042]  It's all on record.
[00:40:07.042 --> 00:40:15.388]  And they invented having Chicago, 80 years ago, plus invest your tax money in fake schemes.
[00:40:18.058 --> 00:40:22.925]  Now, they took that model in the 40s and created the Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports.
[00:40:22.925 --> 00:40:24.006]  It's Mafia!
[00:40:24.006 --> 00:40:25.729]  Our government is run by Mafia.
[00:40:25.729 --> 00:40:33.079]  And they run the CIA, they run the FBI, DynCorp runs the child kidnapping rings on record, no one stops them, they don't get in trouble.
[00:40:34.150 --> 00:40:39.253]  It's just a totally lawless group of criminals that ship in all the drugs they want.
[00:40:39.253 --> 00:40:40.935]  They murder whoever they want.
[00:40:40.935 --> 00:40:46.178]  They run insurance scams in every major city, taking insurance out on people and murdering them.
[00:40:46.178 --> 00:40:49.560]  They have hit teams on the police departments that carry out the murders.
[00:40:49.560 --> 00:40:51.962]  It is just a completely rotten group.
[00:40:51.962 --> 00:40:57.265]  And they've decided to go ahead and blow the economy fully and take all your pension funds and rob everything.
[00:40:57.265 --> 00:41:04.030]  Because why should you, a schmuck in their eyes, why should you, a chump, a sucker, an ignoramus
[00:41:04.190 --> 00:41:06.111]  You know, I knew this over a decade ago.
[00:41:06.111 --> 00:41:08.332]  Local lawyers told me this off-record that work in the city.
[00:41:22.697 --> 00:41:29.980]  But since then, the last six months, it's been in mainstream news, become a big scandal that Walmart takes two, three million dollars out on these greeters.
[00:41:29.980 --> 00:41:33.361]  Now, at least they don't kill them, like the local hit teams do in every city.
[00:41:33.361 --> 00:41:34.821]  Oh yeah, they take it out on your grandma.
[00:41:34.821 --> 00:41:36.482]  She never knows there was a million on her that killed her.
[00:41:37.318 --> 00:41:38.799]  They love old people, it's their favorite.
[00:41:38.799 --> 00:41:43.460]  They'll just sneak in, poison their food, they'll have a heart attack, then they get the cash that way.
[00:41:43.460 --> 00:41:45.781]  Nobody suspects, so they control the coroner.
[00:41:45.781 --> 00:41:48.262]  Oh yeah, this is your folks, this is a murder team, you're talking.
[00:41:48.262 --> 00:41:50.703]  They just, I mean, you want the whole truth?
[00:41:50.703 --> 00:41:52.304]  You want to know how this whole thing works?
[00:41:53.052 --> 00:41:57.015]  Well, going back to Walmart, they take two, three million dollars out.
[00:41:57.015 --> 00:41:58.296]  They've got actuaries.
[00:41:58.296 --> 00:42:05.141]  They know that 79-year-old who's had double bypasses statistically is going to die at a certain point.
[00:42:05.141 --> 00:42:08.444]  They take out the insurance on them through the insurance pooling deal.
[00:42:08.444 --> 00:42:12.227]  They've got deals with the insiders with kickbacks inside the insurance companies.
[00:42:12.227 --> 00:42:14.368]  They know they're going to get two, three mil.
[00:42:14.368 --> 00:42:16.750]  It's going to pay out every year.
[00:42:16.750 --> 00:42:21.394]  And that's why they stick those near-death people up there at the fronts of the things greeting you.
[00:42:21.994 --> 00:42:28.678]  It's nothing but betting on the craps tables, and you love it!
[00:42:28.678 --> 00:42:32.980]  They know when the cancer virus's RNA they've implanted in you are going to kick in and activate.
[00:42:32.980 --> 00:42:36.682]  They know when you're going to be sterilized.
[00:42:36.682 --> 00:42:38.603]  By the way, you know, I oversimplify things.
[00:42:38.603 --> 00:42:45.147]  I was talking last week about how the estrogen mimicking hormones, this is now, again, all over the news.
[00:42:45.147 --> 00:42:46.468]  They've known it from day one.
[00:42:46.468 --> 00:42:48.409]  Thousands of different combinations of plastic.
[00:42:49.881 --> 00:43:02.415]  And worldwide, in the 50s, they standardized and had tax breaks, you name it, if certain types of plastic were adopted as liners in cans, liners in food containers.
[00:43:03.649 --> 00:43:11.337]  Now it's in juice box containers, water containers, that leaches estrogen mimickers into it that are also carcinogenic.
[00:43:11.337 --> 00:43:13.520]  So you wonder why five-year-old girls are now going into puberty.
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:16.243]  It used to be amazing when the eight-year-olds were.
[00:43:16.243 --> 00:43:17.264]  Now it's five-year-olds.
[00:43:17.264 --> 00:43:22.409]  You wonder why the females are hyper-feminine and the men are becoming effeminate.
[00:43:23.274 --> 00:43:26.517]  And I pointed out that that's why homosexuality is way up.
[00:43:26.517 --> 00:43:29.760]  And I got emails saying the Romans were homosexual.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:30.821]  The Greeks were.
[00:43:30.821 --> 00:43:32.283]  Yes, I know that.
[00:43:32.283 --> 00:43:35.546]  I understand that that goes on previously in history.
[00:43:35.546 --> 00:43:38.309]  I'm not saying there aren't people that have that sexual preference.
[00:43:38.309 --> 00:43:41.111]  I'm saying it's increased chemically.
[00:43:41.111 --> 00:43:42.953]  That's why they have frogs!
[00:43:43.954 --> 00:43:52.696]  That are now bisexual, who are hermaphrodites, and fish, in some areas, almost all of them, where they're dumping these chemicals into the water supply.
[00:43:52.696 --> 00:44:03.019]  So much of it is in our sewage that passes through us, birth control, estrogen mimicking plastics, that the frogs are hermaphrodites.
[00:44:05.273 --> 00:44:10.475]  Statistically, you can pull up the numbers, in the last 30 years, there are a lot more hermaphrodites in the Western world.
[00:44:10.475 --> 00:44:12.696]  People being born with both sexual organs.
[00:44:12.696 --> 00:44:14.317]  That isn't a preference, folks.
[00:44:14.317 --> 00:44:20.019]  Those people are screwed up from the chemicals that they got in utero through the placenta.
[00:44:20.019 --> 00:44:20.900]  I've read the studies!
[00:44:22.435 --> 00:44:31.237]  But yes, it's my fault that I got four or five emails that I saw, I'm sure there was more, saying, hey, how come there were people that were gay before?
[00:44:31.237 --> 00:44:32.857]  Obviously, I know that.
[00:44:32.857 --> 00:44:38.259]  I'm saying an artificial increase in it, okay?
[00:44:38.259 --> 00:44:41.419]  Look, little girls aren't supposed to go into puberty when they're five.
[00:44:41.419 --> 00:44:43.640]  They're not supposed to go until they're 12 or 13.
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:47.261]  Boys are effeminate.
[00:44:47.261 --> 00:44:48.701]  They're on estrogen.
[00:44:49.821 --> 00:44:50.602]  Alright, I'm gonna shut up.
[00:44:50.602 --> 00:44:52.863]  I said I'd take your calls.
[00:44:52.863 --> 00:44:57.527]  I just... It's just a total crime syndicate.
[00:44:57.527 --> 00:44:58.648]  Don't you get it?
[00:44:58.648 --> 00:44:59.669]  You've been gullible.
[00:44:59.669 --> 00:45:00.550]  You've been stupid.
[00:45:00.550 --> 00:45:01.330]  I've been stupid.
[00:45:01.330 --> 00:45:02.311]  I've been lazy.
[00:45:02.311 --> 00:45:06.935]  We're in deep, deep trouble here!
[00:45:06.935 --> 00:45:07.275]  You know what?
[00:45:07.275 --> 00:45:08.416]  I'm just gonna suspend covering.
[00:45:08.416 --> 00:45:09.657]  I mean, I haven't even gotten to it.
[00:45:09.657 --> 00:45:12.439]  I mean, just... just... Look at this.
[00:45:12.439 --> 00:45:16.062]  Sea creatures flee oil spill, gather near shore.
[00:45:16.062 --> 00:45:17.924]  Thousands of dolphins, big sharks...
[00:45:18.732 --> 00:45:22.913]  Well, I bet it's amazing to go videotape that, but, again, you have no First Amendment.
[00:45:22.913 --> 00:45:27.794]  Armed goons just show up and even kick ABC, CBS, CNN off the beach.
[00:45:27.794 --> 00:45:29.074]  People say, well, why don't I go there?
[00:45:29.074 --> 00:45:30.535]  I can't do everything.
[00:45:30.535 --> 00:45:36.996]  Yeah, it'd be an interesting story for me to go to Louisiana and show guys threatening to throw me off the beach and, okay, I get thrown in jail.
[00:45:36.996 --> 00:45:37.796]  I mean, we know!
[00:45:37.796 --> 00:45:43.998]  I would go there if it wasn't being reported that they were arresting people and throwing them off.
[00:45:43.998 --> 00:45:45.098]  But it's admitted!
[00:45:45.098 --> 00:45:47.199]  I can play you a YouTube clip and show it to you.
[00:45:47.199 --> 00:45:48.199]  But that's the tyranny.
[00:45:50.017 --> 00:45:52.038]  Sea creatures flee oil spill, gather near shore.
[00:45:52.038 --> 00:45:56.299]  Dolphins and sharks are showing up in surprisingly shallow water just off the Florida coast.
[00:45:56.299 --> 00:46:01.781]  Mullets, crabs, rays, and small fish congregate by the thousands off an Alabama pier.
[00:46:01.781 --> 00:46:05.683]  Birds covered in oil are crawling deep into the marshes, never to be seen again.
[00:46:05.683 --> 00:46:09.744]  Marine scientists studying the effects of BP disaster are seeing more strange phenomenon.
[00:46:09.744 --> 00:46:17.707]  Fish and wildlife seem to be fleeing the oil out of the Gulf and clustering in cleaner waters along the coast in a trend that some researchers see as a potentially troubling sign.
[00:46:23.046 --> 00:46:26.588]  Well, what happens when a volcano goes off and spews lava into the ocean?
[00:46:26.588 --> 00:46:27.528]  Animals die.
[00:46:27.528 --> 00:46:29.029]  I'm not saying this is good.
[00:46:29.029 --> 00:46:32.111]  The point is, this is not the end of the world.
[00:46:32.111 --> 00:46:34.032]  The media is distracting you.
[00:46:34.032 --> 00:46:36.773]  What could be the end of the world is an attack on Iran.
[00:46:36.773 --> 00:46:38.954]  I'm going to cover that next hour.
[00:46:38.954 --> 00:46:41.856]  Yes, that could be the end of civilization as we know it.
[00:46:41.856 --> 00:46:43.696]  This earth was born out of fire.
[00:46:43.696 --> 00:46:50.320]  It was born out of going through the Kuiper Belt every 25 million years.
[00:46:53.168 --> 00:47:07.920]  Being hit by thousands in a million-year period of giant asteroids destroying all life, all large life on the planet, and then coming back from plants and plankton and smaller organisms.
[00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:10.963]  This Earth is pot-marked.
[00:47:10.963 --> 00:47:12.784]  Look at the surface of the Moon.
[00:47:12.784 --> 00:47:22.212]  Look at Shoemaker-Levy going into Saturn, breaking up into five pieces, blowing holes in Saturn's atmosphere bigger than the Earth.
[00:47:25.723 --> 00:47:29.205]  Okay, this oil spill is not wormwood.
[00:47:29.205 --> 00:47:31.926]  It is not one-third of the world's oceans dying.
[00:47:31.926 --> 00:47:35.809]  But genetically engineered nanotech getting into the ocean could be.
[00:47:35.809 --> 00:47:37.149]  That's the real threat.
[00:47:37.149 --> 00:47:50.957]  And they've got thousands of companies around the clock, randomly splicing genetics, looking for advancements in healthcare, and advancements in weapons, and advancements in microprocessing that could create wormwood.
[00:47:54.585 --> 00:48:00.773]  That's the passage in the Bible.
[00:48:00.773 --> 00:48:03.376]  Wormwood.
[00:48:03.376 --> 00:48:04.558]  Beeched wood.
[00:48:04.558 --> 00:48:05.779]  Rotten.
[00:48:05.779 --> 00:48:09.283]  On the side of the ocean shore.
[00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:12.140]  One-third of the animals dead.
[00:48:12.140 --> 00:48:16.022]  That is not what has happened and that is not what's going to happen.
[00:48:16.022 --> 00:48:20.303]  Obama administration spends $1.2 billion on cycling and walking initiatives.
[00:48:20.303 --> 00:48:30.766]  Yeah, three months ago in the Wall Street Journal, the head of the transportation department said, our job is dismantling the use of cars, not funding highways, and ending industrialized society.
[00:48:30.766 --> 00:48:32.067]  What have you heard from all these people?
[00:48:32.067 --> 00:48:32.627]  What have you heard
[00:48:33.567 --> 00:48:45.412]  I saw more quotes just today by administration officials, not public servants, about how it's their job to dismantle our industrial society.
[00:48:45.412 --> 00:48:46.872]  They're doing a great job.
[00:48:46.872 --> 00:48:49.494]  There's no industry left.
[00:48:49.494 --> 00:48:56.236]  But their powerhouse, China, is growing 10 plus percent growth rate every year because they know how to kill off their population.
[00:48:56.236 --> 00:48:57.837]  They know how to serve the new world order.
[00:49:00.418 --> 00:49:07.783]  And the article goes on in London Telegraph to say it's to get people out of their cars, which sounds reasonable if you want to, but not that cars are bad.
[00:49:07.783 --> 00:49:14.647]  See, the secret is they built our country with the big highways and the megacities based on sprawl, based on the highways.
[00:49:14.647 --> 00:49:16.108]  There's no way to reverse this.
[00:49:16.108 --> 00:49:17.489]  They got us right where they want us.
[00:49:17.489 --> 00:49:25.774]  The Pentagon designed it where we're dependent on fossil fuels, dependent on superhighways, and now they're going to cut that off to us.
[00:49:25.774 --> 00:49:28.716]  Now they're going to bankrupt you and drive you into globalist submission.
[00:49:29.790 --> 00:49:30.430]  Here's another one.
[00:49:30.430 --> 00:49:40.952]  New Orleans runs $5 million anti-British campaign paid for by BP, blaming it on the British people and saying this isn't the first time New Orleans has survived the British attack.
[00:49:40.952 --> 00:49:49.514]  Yeah, when the British Navy came in and Andrew Jackson fought them off.
[00:49:49.514 --> 00:49:57.716]  I guess you could say the majority, it's not even a majority, but the biggest group, what is it, 27% of the shareholders are British.
[00:49:58.479 --> 00:50:00.840]  That it's broken up into other countries?
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:02.822]  The Dutch are the next, the Americans the next.
[00:50:02.822 --> 00:50:04.703]  I mean, it's a red herring.
[00:50:04.703 --> 00:50:06.424]  Yeah, let's blame the British.
[00:50:06.424 --> 00:50:15.669]  Let's blame the average Brit under New World Order control, having their water poisoned, their food poisoned, global government coming down on them, being sucked into the Euro.
[00:50:15.669 --> 00:50:19.092]  And they run stupid ads about a miracle stand-up against the British.
[00:50:19.092 --> 00:50:20.172]  What does that have to do with anything?
[00:50:20.172 --> 00:50:21.413]  It's another distraction.
[00:50:21.413 --> 00:50:24.475]  Meanwhile, the chairman of BP can't even speak proper English.
[00:50:27.250 --> 00:50:31.233]  Iran threatens to stop Western ships as objected to cargo inspection.
[00:50:31.233 --> 00:50:34.235]  That's going to be our top story after I take calls.
[00:50:34.235 --> 00:50:35.916]  Crude oil drops in prices.
[00:50:35.916 --> 00:50:39.378]  Gold rises after jobless claims.
[00:50:39.378 --> 00:50:45.041]  100 Italian economists say austerity, that means higher taxes, less government services, will destroy Europe.
[00:50:45.041 --> 00:50:46.062]  It's meant to destroy you.
[00:50:46.062 --> 00:50:47.403]  That's the name of the game.
[00:50:47.403 --> 00:50:48.203]  Command destruction.
[00:50:48.203 --> 00:50:48.864]  It's all on record.
[00:50:50.180 --> 00:50:55.029]  It's all coming up, and I promise I'm going to Lawrence, Jim, Ernie, Fred, Wayne, and others straight ahead.
[00:50:55.029 --> 00:50:58.595]  Infowars.com, PrisonPlanet.tv are the websites.

[00:52:00.785 --> 00:52:05.747]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[00:52:05.747 --> 00:52:06.748]  What have we got?
[00:52:06.748 --> 00:52:09.189]  A republic or a monarchy?
[00:52:09.189 --> 00:52:10.209]  A republic.
[00:52:10.209 --> 00:52:12.850]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[00:52:12.850 --> 00:52:15.111]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[00:52:15.111 --> 00:52:17.132]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[00:52:17.132 --> 00:52:18.813]  So they think they own our land?
[00:52:18.813 --> 00:52:20.133]  They think they own our water?
[00:52:20.133 --> 00:52:20.734]  Children?
[00:52:20.734 --> 00:52:21.874]  Our education?
[00:52:21.874 --> 00:52:22.714]  Our money?
[00:52:22.714 --> 00:52:26.356]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[00:52:26.716 --> 00:52:30.400]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:31.681]  You're being warned!
[00:52:31.681 --> 00:52:32.702]  We have the facts.
[00:52:32.702 --> 00:52:33.863]  We have the Constitution.
[00:52:33.863 --> 00:52:34.784]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[00:52:34.784 --> 00:52:35.665]  We have common law.
[00:52:35.665 --> 00:52:38.187]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:52:38.187 --> 00:52:41.130]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[00:52:41.130 --> 00:52:42.071]  Rise of the Republic.
[00:52:42.071 --> 00:52:47.035]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[00:52:47.035 --> 00:52:48.537]  A new tool in the Info War.
[00:52:48.537 --> 00:52:49.618]  Don't Tread on Me.
[00:52:49.618 --> 00:52:50.899]  Order it at InfoWars.com.
[00:52:52.160 --> 00:53:03.024]  Or prisonplanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[00:53:03.024 --> 00:53:04.244]  This is not a drill.
[00:53:04.244 --> 00:53:06.165]  Repeat, this is not a drill.
[00:53:07.005 --> 00:53:07.545]  We're good to go.
[00:53:30.755 --> 00:53:32.396]  Under any circumstance.
[00:53:32.396 --> 00:53:39.622]  These and other closely guarded gun caching secrets are guaranteed to keep your weapons safe and out of sight when the going gets tough.
[00:53:39.622 --> 00:53:40.322]  But listen up.
[00:53:40.322 --> 00:53:46.567]  For security reasons, the Hide Your Guns book and even the website may disappear without warning at any time.
[00:53:46.567 --> 00:53:48.409]  Go to hideyourguns.com.
[00:53:48.409 --> 00:53:50.570]  That's hideyourguns.com.
[00:53:50.570 --> 00:53:51.831]  Or call 877-327-0365.
[00:53:51.831 --> 00:53:56.114]  Before they come for your guns.
[00:53:56.114 --> 00:53:57.936]  Hideyourguns.com.
[00:53:57.936 --> 00:53:58.376]  Right now.
[00:54:18.052 --> 00:54:29.840]  The global parasites have an advantage over us because we just can't believe how criminal, and how wicked, and how evil, and how bloodthirsty, and abusive, and sickening, and arrogant, and over-the-top they are.
[00:54:29.840 --> 00:54:33.202]  They're so bold.
[00:54:33.202 --> 00:54:38.925]  But you notice they always talk to you in a real sweet, fatherly or motherly NPR voice, the politicians.
[00:54:38.925 --> 00:54:40.326]  Shh, shh, shh.
[00:54:40.326 --> 00:54:42.768]  We're not with the extremists.
[00:54:42.768 --> 00:54:45.089]  We're the mainstream.
[00:54:45.089 --> 00:54:46.951]  Don't raise your voice.
[00:54:47.864 --> 00:54:49.765]  Don't get excited.
[00:54:49.765 --> 00:54:59.071]  It's like the computer, the HAL 9000 in 2001 Space Odyssey.
[00:54:59.071 --> 00:55:01.573]  Dave, I don't see any reason for us to talk anymore.
[00:55:01.573 --> 00:55:07.036]  I've killed your partner, the other astronaut, and now I'm going to kill you.
[00:55:07.036 --> 00:55:08.537]  Goodbye, Dave.
[00:55:08.537 --> 00:55:12.600]  And we're supposed to go, oh, you're talking to us in a soft Dave voice.
[00:55:14.295 --> 00:55:17.778]  By the way, they talked about mind control last night on MSNBC.
[00:55:17.778 --> 00:55:19.099]  I couldn't believe it.
[00:55:19.099 --> 00:55:29.368]  They hate Glenn Beck so much that they actually admitted that he's using manipulative psychological warfare techniques.
[00:55:29.368 --> 00:55:31.330]  But see, they're actually tattling on themselves.
[00:55:31.330 --> 00:55:38.776]  That shows that they realize what they're doing and that they use those techniques all the time consciously.
[00:55:38.776 --> 00:55:41.819]  All those techniques are just based on normal human persuasiveness.
[00:55:47.554 --> 00:56:00.590]  What you got is a bunch of losers who aren't passionate, who aren't charismatic, who aren't persuasive, who lie to themselves and tell themselves there's all these techniques to manipulate.
[00:56:00.590 --> 00:56:03.554]  No, the truth is what is powerful.
[00:56:04.946 --> 00:56:07.547]  And that's something you can't ever compare to.
[00:56:07.547 --> 00:56:16.369]  That's why Glenn Beck has taken on a lot of the truth and attached it to his hermit crab shell as camouflage, but he has been exposed as well.
[00:56:16.369 --> 00:56:17.750]  All right, I said I'd go to your calls.
[00:56:17.750 --> 00:56:22.831]  Don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, but I'm going to talk about that more coming up when I get into the MSNBC piece.
[00:56:22.831 --> 00:56:28.293]  Don't forget, folks, that your purchase of books, videos, T-shirts, ball caps,
[00:56:29.213 --> 00:56:36.075]  Citizen Rule books from the InfoWars.com online video bookstore is what makes this radio show and what we do here possible.
[00:56:36.075 --> 00:56:38.655]  We have two different shopping carts available.
[00:56:38.655 --> 00:56:40.596]  The new shopping cart and the old Yahoo shopping cart.
[00:56:40.596 --> 00:56:43.136]  They're both excellent up on InfoWars.com.
[00:56:43.136 --> 00:56:49.878]  I want to thank all of you that have supported us by buying books, videos, and materials and who have made copies of my films and gotten them out to everybody.
[00:56:49.878 --> 00:56:51.838]  So again, InfoWars.com.
[00:56:51.838 --> 00:56:56.220]  Let's go to, Fred just hung up, so we'll go to Lawrence in California.
[00:56:56.220 --> 00:56:57.600]  Lawrence, you're on the air.
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:57.920]  Welcome.
[00:56:59.252 --> 00:57:00.433]  How are you doing, Alex?
[00:57:00.433 --> 00:57:01.413]  I'm doing alright, Lawrence.
[00:57:01.413 --> 00:57:03.054]  What's on your mind?
[00:57:03.054 --> 00:57:03.515]  Oh, man.
[00:57:03.515 --> 00:57:06.196]  First and foremost, I just got to salute you.
[00:57:06.196 --> 00:57:09.738]  I want to thank you personally for unplugging me from the Matrix.
[00:57:09.738 --> 00:57:14.721]  You know, to me, you're like the Morpheus and I'm the Neo.
[00:57:14.721 --> 00:57:16.282]  You helped me so far.
[00:57:16.282 --> 00:57:17.983]  So far.
[00:57:17.983 --> 00:57:23.186]  Because of you and your efforts, I have... I'm a musician from California.
[00:57:23.186 --> 00:57:25.588]  I've been doing music for, I don't know, 10 years now.
[00:57:27.904 --> 00:57:32.047]  I have not had my eyes open like this ever.
[00:57:32.047 --> 00:57:38.111]  So, about a year ago, I came across a couple of the documentaries you did.
[00:57:38.111 --> 00:57:43.074]  The Obama Dictation and The Fall of the Republic.
[00:57:43.074 --> 00:57:43.454]  Yes, sir.
[00:57:43.454 --> 00:57:50.498]  And all those good documentaries actually pushed me to actually start writing my own book.
[00:57:50.498 --> 00:57:50.979]  Good!
[00:57:50.979 --> 00:57:54.601]  It's called The Red Pill, which I don't have to tell you what it's about.
[00:57:56.486 --> 00:57:58.753]  It's about waking up, yeah.
[00:57:58.753 --> 00:57:59.817]  Yeah, exactly.
[00:57:59.817 --> 00:58:02.125]  By the way, that's a great name for a book, The Red Pill.
[00:58:04.231 --> 00:58:04.371]  Yes.
[00:58:04.371 --> 00:58:11.352]  It actually came from one of your videos that I've seen on YouTube, when you were doing YouTube videos.
[00:58:11.352 --> 00:58:13.773]  And I actually said, you know, that's a good idea.
[00:58:13.773 --> 00:58:17.133]  And I went and I pushed for it and I started working on that book.
[00:58:17.133 --> 00:58:25.275]  Yeah, I was describing everybody that goes out and takes action and gets the word out is literally delivering red pills to people.
[00:58:25.275 --> 00:58:26.835]  It's their choice whether they take it or not.
[00:58:26.835 --> 00:58:30.856]  For those that don't know from the movie Matrix, you take the red pill and
[00:58:31.676 --> 00:58:37.659]  You go down to Alice in Wonderland, you find out how deep the rabbit hole goes, take the blue pill, you're back in the Matrix.
[00:58:37.659 --> 00:58:40.320]  Stay there, we'll be back in one minute.
[00:58:40.320 --> 00:58:45.223]  This broadcast is available on MP3 CD format at GCNLive.com or call toll free 877-300-7645.
[00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:52.442]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[00:58:52.442 --> 00:58:54.844]  We are part of a New World Order.
[00:58:54.844 --> 00:58:58.066]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[00:58:58.066 --> 00:59:03.150]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[00:59:03.150 --> 00:59:07.354]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[00:59:07.654 --> 00:59:10.135]  It means all the world under their control.
[00:59:10.135 --> 00:59:12.896]  The United Nations would take over America.
[00:59:12.896 --> 00:59:15.818]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[00:59:15.818 --> 00:59:23.401]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[00:59:23.757 --> 00:59:29.140]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[00:59:29.140 --> 00:59:31.981]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[00:59:31.981 --> 00:59:35.663]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[00:59:35.663 --> 00:59:36.744]  And I got news for you.
[00:59:36.744 --> 00:59:38.085]  You're everyone else.
[00:59:38.085 --> 00:59:39.585]  Invisible Empire.

[00:59:55.738 --> 01:00:05.183]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:05.183 --> 01:00:06.504]  Big Brother.
[01:00:06.504 --> 01:00:08.265]  Mainstream media.
[01:00:08.265 --> 01:00:09.446]  Government cover-ups.
[01:00:09.446 --> 01:00:11.627]  You want answers?
[01:00:11.627 --> 01:00:13.147]  Well, so does he.
[01:00:13.147 --> 01:00:17.350]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[01:00:17.350 --> 01:00:21.432]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[01:00:22.685 --> 01:00:28.311]  Coming up, professor, only global government can save us from a century of chaos.
[01:00:28.311 --> 01:00:34.377]  And we've seen the founder of the modern environmental movement, the Gaia Movement, saying we want a tyrannical world government.
[01:00:34.377 --> 01:00:37.620]  The public's too stupid, we must enforce it through tyranny.
[01:00:37.620 --> 01:00:39.021]  This is being reported by the Daily Mail.
[01:00:39.021 --> 01:00:43.065]  There's a Herald Sun, here's the headline, our own extinction is forecast.
[01:00:44.287 --> 01:00:48.191]  And all these top globalists are saying, oh, we'll all soon be dead.
[01:00:48.191 --> 01:00:50.794]  Well, yeah, because that's what they're planning to do.
[01:00:50.794 --> 01:00:53.397]  See, they create the crisis, they offer the solution.
[01:00:53.397 --> 01:00:57.921]  Okay, I'm going to try to hurry through your calls now because I've got a bunch of news I want to hit as well.
[01:00:57.921 --> 01:01:03.347]  Lawrence in California was getting into the red pill versus the blue pill and the awakening of humanity.
[01:01:03.347 --> 01:01:04.168]  Go ahead and finish your point.
[01:01:05.276 --> 01:01:18.501]  Yes, actually the point I was trying to make, I had a question because I've been promoting this book since I started writing and I've been giving out chapters to different people that I know and they've been loving it.
[01:01:18.501 --> 01:01:22.163]  They've been telling me to get it done, especially my uncle, which is a vet.
[01:01:22.163 --> 01:01:23.664]  He's a Marine vet.
[01:01:25.242 --> 01:01:31.125]  The thing is, I've been trying to get it to these publishing companies and it's kind of like I'm being blackballed.
[01:01:31.125 --> 01:01:34.668]  It's like they're telling me no one cares about this situation.
[01:01:34.668 --> 01:01:38.790]  This is something that no one wants to look at or take their time out to read.
[01:01:38.790 --> 01:01:41.832]  Well, number one, something... Look, I mean, if it's a good book...
[01:01:42.512 --> 01:01:43.652]  That's a great title.
[01:01:43.652 --> 01:01:47.833]  Nothing is hotter than the awakening happening right now and the system knows that.
[01:01:47.833 --> 01:01:53.514]  That's why they cover us constantly just to try to stay relevant and in the game.
[01:01:53.514 --> 01:01:56.415]  The issue is the publishing industry is imploding.
[01:01:56.415 --> 01:01:58.235]  The economy is imploding.
[01:01:58.235 --> 01:02:00.396]  People don't read books like they did before.
[01:02:00.396 --> 01:02:02.276]  Hollywood's even losing money.
[01:02:02.276 --> 01:02:06.057]  The record industry is on the verge of collapsing.
[01:02:06.057 --> 01:02:08.478]  Mainstream news is even admitting that right now.
[01:02:08.478 --> 01:02:09.638]  So it's very tough.
[01:02:09.638 --> 01:02:10.018]  I had
[01:02:11.257 --> 01:02:16.258]  To self-publish my own book.
[01:02:16.258 --> 01:02:17.479]  And I didn't even reprint it.
[01:02:17.479 --> 01:02:20.759]  I sold 15,000 copies.
[01:02:20.759 --> 01:02:22.920]  I printed 5,000, sold them right away.
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:28.421]  This was eight years ago, nine years ago, and I thought, well, I'll just print 10,000.
[01:02:28.421 --> 01:02:32.262]  These sold so quick, but I didn't know that you sell everything up front.
[01:02:32.262 --> 01:02:34.623]  I was still ignorant then, and I learn more every day.
[01:02:34.623 --> 01:02:37.184]  And so it took me until just a few months ago to sell the additional 10,000.
[01:02:38.604 --> 01:02:47.547]  And so I'm not going back into reprinting of that book because I can't afford to print 5,000 or so and then wait four or five years to sell them.
[01:02:47.547 --> 01:02:53.048]  I can only make something new, hot, intriguing, and then try to fund myself right off the bat.
[01:02:53.048 --> 01:02:54.429]  And so that's the nature of it.
[01:02:54.429 --> 01:02:55.189]  There's a glut.
[01:02:56.443 --> 01:02:57.023]  Of course!
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:10.960]  I don't know.
[01:03:36.347 --> 01:03:44.433]  And I was paid $200 a week at first, and then a year into it I had a weekday show and I was paid $400 a week.
[01:03:44.433 --> 01:03:47.735]  My radio show generated over $40,000 a month for the station.
[01:03:47.735 --> 01:03:51.357]  I didn't have a manager, I didn't have an agent, I didn't know anything.
[01:03:51.357 --> 01:03:56.661]  I was getting as high ratings as Howard Stern had on a local station.
[01:03:56.661 --> 01:03:58.542]  The local station was paying for that show.
[01:03:58.542 --> 01:04:00.143]  $300,000 a year.
[01:04:03.266 --> 01:04:05.787]  And the other hosts that were local had no ratings.
[01:04:05.787 --> 01:04:09.709]  I didn't know why they were all so jealous and literally hated me with a passion.
[01:04:09.709 --> 01:04:11.649]  Well, they weren't talk show hosts.
[01:04:11.649 --> 01:04:12.890]  Sharkman was his nickname.
[01:04:12.890 --> 01:04:17.352]  He was a real syndicated former CBS guy who'd been all over the country.
[01:04:17.352 --> 01:04:19.872]  He recognized me as a talent on Access.
[01:04:19.872 --> 01:04:21.793]  He got me my job in radio.
[01:04:21.793 --> 01:04:23.334]  And then they basically laid him off.
[01:04:23.894 --> 01:04:25.816]  And he went to Phoenix to do a show.
[01:04:25.816 --> 01:04:27.137]  I gotta get a hold of Sharkman.
[01:04:27.137 --> 01:04:28.598]  If I know what name he's going by now.
[01:04:28.598 --> 01:04:30.160]  I even forget his real name.
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:31.521]  Pop in my head in a minute.
[01:04:31.521 --> 01:04:33.403]  A real radio guy gave me my job.
[01:04:33.403 --> 01:04:35.605]  Okay, then he left.
[01:04:35.605 --> 01:04:38.167]  And these jealous nobodies.
[01:04:38.167 --> 01:04:40.049]  I mean, one guy had never even been in radio.
[01:04:40.549 --> 01:04:42.091]  And he was the program director.
[01:04:42.091 --> 01:04:45.954]  And I had these huge ratings, tons of money, and so they hated me even more!
[01:04:45.954 --> 01:04:52.861]  Then Jay Leno talked about me, and National News talked about me, BBC was there the day they fired me, and they said, get out of here!
[01:04:52.861 --> 01:04:58.506]  Because the owners of the station were globalists, and they found out that I was on one of their stations.
[01:04:58.506 --> 01:04:59.668]  But anyways, I'm a side issue.
[01:05:00.188 --> 01:05:01.829]  Hello friends, this is Alex Jones.
[01:05:01.829 --> 01:05:05.190]  You've heard me talk about Calden 5 Star Soaps for years.

[01:05:21.499 --> 01:05:24.162]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[01:05:24.162 --> 01:05:30.667]  Since 1947, Calbin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.

[01:05:52.694 --> 01:05:53.375]  Thank you!
[01:05:59.861 --> 01:06:04.825]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[01:06:04.825 --> 01:06:05.825]  What have we got?
[01:06:05.825 --> 01:06:08.267]  A republic or a monarchy?
[01:06:08.267 --> 01:06:09.268]  A republic.
[01:06:09.268 --> 01:06:11.930]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[01:06:11.930 --> 01:06:14.192]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[01:06:14.192 --> 01:06:16.213]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[01:06:16.213 --> 01:06:17.894]  So they think they own our land?
[01:06:17.894 --> 01:06:19.215]  They think they own our water?
[01:06:19.215 --> 01:06:19.836]  Children?
[01:06:19.836 --> 01:06:20.937]  Our education?
[01:06:20.937 --> 01:06:21.777]  Our money?
[01:06:21.777 --> 01:06:25.440]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:30.767]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[01:06:30.767 --> 01:06:31.788]  We have the facts.
[01:06:31.788 --> 01:06:32.950]  We have the Constitution.
[01:06:32.950 --> 01:06:33.851]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[01:06:33.851 --> 01:06:34.752]  We have common law.
[01:06:34.752 --> 01:06:37.256]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:06:37.256 --> 01:06:41.041]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[01:06:41.141 --> 01:06:46.105]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[01:06:46.105 --> 01:06:47.606]  A new tool in the Info War.
[01:06:47.606 --> 01:06:48.687]  Don't tread on me.
[01:06:48.687 --> 01:06:55.573]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[01:06:59.676 --> 01:07:04.238]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:07:04.238 --> 01:07:05.138]  Number 1.
[01:07:05.138 --> 01:07:08.560]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:07:08.560 --> 01:07:09.420]  Number 2.
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:14.322]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:07:14.322 --> 01:07:15.062]  It's true.
[01:07:15.062 --> 01:07:19.925]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:07:19.925 --> 01:07:20.765]  Number 3.
[01:07:20.765 --> 01:07:24.346]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:07:24.346 --> 01:07:28.048]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:07:28.248 --> 01:07:29.048]  Number 4.
[01:07:29.048 --> 01:07:31.809]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:07:31.809 --> 01:07:35.490]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:07:35.490 --> 01:07:36.271]  Number 5.
[01:07:36.271 --> 01:07:40.432]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:07:40.432 --> 01:07:45.474]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:07:45.474 --> 01:07:49.655]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:49.655 --> 01:07:51.435]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:07:51.435 --> 01:07:56.037]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:07:57.497 --> 01:08:02.618]  The Matrix is everywhere.
[01:08:02.618 --> 01:08:04.599]  It is all around us.
[01:08:04.599 --> 01:08:07.339]  Even now, in this very room.
[01:08:07.339 --> 01:08:12.480]  You can see it when you look out your window, or when you turn on your television.
[01:08:12.480 --> 01:08:19.822]  You can feel it when you go to work, when you go to church, when you pay your taxes.
[01:08:21.937 --> 01:08:28.903]  It is the world that has been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth.
[01:08:28.903 --> 01:08:34.447]  What truth?
[01:08:34.447 --> 01:08:37.469]  That you are a slave, Neo.
[01:08:37.469 --> 01:08:40.131]  Like everyone else, you were born into bondage.
[01:08:40.131 --> 01:08:45.035]  Born into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch.
[01:08:45.035 --> 01:08:47.377]  A prison for your mind.
[01:08:54.762 --> 01:09:03.247]  Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Matrix is.
[01:09:03.247 --> 01:09:14.693]  You have to see it for yourself.
[01:09:14.693 --> 01:09:15.954]  This is your last chance.
[01:09:17.259 --> 01:09:19.861]  After this, there is no turning back.
[01:09:19.861 --> 01:09:21.723]  You take the blue pill.
[01:09:21.723 --> 01:09:23.504]  The story ends.
[01:09:23.504 --> 01:09:26.947]  You wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe.
[01:09:26.947 --> 01:09:28.488]  You take the red pill.
[01:09:28.488 --> 01:09:31.130]  You stay in Wonderland.
[01:09:31.130 --> 01:09:43.661]  And I show you how deep the rabbit hole goes.
[01:09:43.661 --> 01:09:44.001]  Remember.
[01:09:45.703 --> 01:09:47.304]  All I'm offering is the truth.
[01:09:47.304 --> 01:10:00.494]  Nothing more.
[01:10:10.731 --> 01:10:12.713]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m.
[01:10:12.713 --> 01:10:13.533]  to 3 p.m.
[01:10:13.533 --> 01:10:15.155]  Central Standard Time.
[01:10:15.155 --> 01:10:17.557]  We are here live.
[01:10:17.557 --> 01:10:19.919]  Thank you for joining us.
[01:10:19.919 --> 01:10:24.222]  We're going to go live at PrisonPlanet.tv in the third and fourth hour today.
[01:10:24.222 --> 01:10:31.368]  We do have Lindsey Williams on part two of his oil spill expose in the final hour today.
[01:10:31.368 --> 01:10:33.250]  I'm continuing with your phone calls.
[01:10:33.250 --> 01:10:34.071]  Our first caller
[01:10:34.631 --> 01:10:39.257]  I'm going to get to the others here in a moment, but I want to answer Lawrence's question from California.
[01:10:39.257 --> 01:10:41.119]  He was asking if he's written a book.
[01:10:42.065 --> 01:10:43.705]  How to get it published.
[01:10:43.705 --> 01:11:04.830]  And I was telling him that it's great to try to get a big publisher to do it up front, but generally it's best to self-publish something and just get it done, and then create a blog, a website, and promote your book, make videos about it, make podcasts, and if you've got the message, and if you've got the material, if you've got the talent, if you build it, they will come.
[01:11:04.830 --> 01:11:07.171]  And then I was briefly going back to my start in radio,
[01:11:09.150 --> 01:11:12.933]  It's a good thing I wasn't doing this to be successful and to be a big shot.
[01:11:12.933 --> 01:11:14.995]  I had no intention of that.
[01:11:14.995 --> 01:11:17.117]  Zero.
[01:11:17.117 --> 01:11:19.138]  I wanted to defend the Second Amendment.
[01:11:19.138 --> 01:11:20.740]  I wanted to defend property rights.
[01:11:20.740 --> 01:11:22.641]  I wanted to stop illegal wars.
[01:11:22.641 --> 01:11:26.364]  I didn't want America financing a global corporate empire.
[01:11:26.364 --> 01:11:29.787]  I wanted to abolish the private Federal Reserve.
[01:11:29.787 --> 01:11:31.869]  I understood these things.
[01:11:31.869 --> 01:11:36.753]  I understood that when I went to college, those colleges were anti-freedom, anti-America.
[01:11:38.413 --> 01:11:43.878]  And I knew that we were under threat as a society, and so I began to expose it.
[01:11:43.878 --> 01:11:55.207]  And I didn't understand why right away I got high ratings, and there were self-destructive people that ran the radio station, the good people had left, who'd hired me, and that they were mad that I was so successful.
[01:11:55.207 --> 01:12:04.215]  They were mad that I was all over the newspaper, and that I was making national news, hard copy, extra, BBC, ABC Nightly News.
[01:12:04.215 --> 01:12:05.076]  They were angry!
[01:12:06.343 --> 01:12:13.006]  That's why they ended up losing their jobs later after they fired me.
[01:12:13.006 --> 01:12:28.054]  And the owners, who owned a bunch of radio stations, Shamrock Communications, and who owned a bunch of radio stations and newspapers, they came down and they told me, you quit talking about the New World Order, you talk about sex and partying and fun things, or you're fired.
[01:12:28.054 --> 01:12:30.435]  And I said, but I'm making you all this money, I have high ratings.
[01:12:31.483 --> 01:12:33.784]  And I said, I really can't.
[01:12:33.784 --> 01:12:35.465]  And they said, you will, you'll lose your job.
[01:12:35.465 --> 01:12:37.146]  And a few weeks later, they fired me.
[01:12:37.146 --> 01:12:38.066]  But I didn't care.
[01:12:38.066 --> 01:12:40.848]  It was all about the truth.
[01:12:40.848 --> 01:12:49.632]  What would be the point of being on talk radio and being able to talk to people and not talking about the truth?
[01:12:49.632 --> 01:12:53.854]  Not defending my family, my culture, my society.
[01:12:53.854 --> 01:12:55.555]  I cannot sell out.
[01:12:55.555 --> 01:12:56.876]  I will not sell out.
[01:12:59.224 --> 01:13:09.571]  That's why the globalists attack me constantly through their COINTELPRO from above and below from the establishment and these fake anti-establishment as a sellout because that's the only avenue they've got.
[01:13:09.571 --> 01:13:10.912]  I'm so real.
[01:13:10.912 --> 01:13:12.053]  I'm so bonafide.
[01:13:12.053 --> 01:13:13.414]  I'm such a real McCoy.
[01:13:13.414 --> 01:13:21.640]  The fruit of my labor is so real and so effective and so dangerous that they attack me from every corner.
[01:13:23.669 --> 01:13:27.012]  And it's intensifying because I have the spirit of victory.
[01:13:27.012 --> 01:13:44.567]  I got a lot of problems and I'm not perfect, but people can model after what I've done and they can build upon it and improve upon it and I know we can beat these people because we're in the right and if we just don't stop and we keep moving forward, the New World Order is going down big time.
[01:13:47.873 --> 01:14:09.914]  And so don't expect so many people start little political organizations, and they plan, and they organize, and they constantly talk about what they're going to do, and they constantly talk about how they're going to write a book, or they're going to have an AXS TV show, or they're going to get a local radio show, or they're going to go to their state house, or they're going to organize a march, but they never do it.
[01:14:09.914 --> 01:14:12.297]  They have committee meetings after committee meetings.
[01:14:12.617 --> 01:14:14.518]  Just get on the street.
[01:14:14.518 --> 01:14:15.758]  Get into the state houses.
[01:14:15.758 --> 01:14:17.159]  Get into the city councils.
[01:14:17.159 --> 01:14:18.440]  Run for office.
[01:14:18.440 --> 01:14:19.680]  Get aggressive.
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:21.161]  Don't be apologetic.
[01:14:21.161 --> 01:14:22.341]  Be fiery.
[01:14:22.341 --> 01:14:23.642]  That's what the people want.
[01:14:23.642 --> 01:14:26.623]  They want red blood.
[01:14:26.623 --> 01:14:31.786]  They want oxygen-filled blood, not stale, blue-blood garbage.
[01:14:31.786 --> 01:14:35.808]  You know what blue blood is, folks?
[01:14:35.808 --> 01:14:37.628]  The globalists have good names for themselves.
[01:14:37.628 --> 01:14:38.629]  Blue bloods.
[01:14:38.629 --> 01:14:40.510]  Blood that doesn't have oxygen in it is blue.
[01:14:41.800 --> 01:14:44.582]  That's why your veins are blue.
[01:14:44.582 --> 01:14:50.908]  But the blood we think of, that we see on the ground, spilt in the fight for liberty, is red!
[01:14:50.908 --> 01:14:55.012]  Because it's spilt outside the body.
[01:14:55.012 --> 01:14:55.933]  It's been spilt.
[01:14:55.933 --> 01:14:57.674]  It's been released.
[01:14:57.674 --> 01:15:03.840]  And when that blood comes out of your lungs, and is pounded through your heart, and sent out to your body, it's red!
[01:15:03.840 --> 01:15:04.881]  It's animated!
[01:15:04.881 --> 01:15:05.561]  It's red blood!
[01:15:07.009 --> 01:15:08.009]  Are you red-blooded?
[01:15:08.009 --> 01:15:11.871]  Or are you a cold, slimy, vampiric blueblood?
[01:15:11.871 --> 01:15:13.692]  Are you an undead?
[01:15:13.692 --> 01:15:15.172]  Is your soul dead?
[01:15:15.172 --> 01:15:21.615]  Or does it have the animating fire of liberty in it?
[01:15:21.615 --> 01:15:25.396]  The enemy tells you to lay down, be weak, be soft-spoken.
[01:15:25.396 --> 01:15:27.637]  This is the doctrine of losers.
[01:15:27.637 --> 01:15:29.418]  This is the doctrine of slaves.
[01:15:31.266 --> 01:15:32.847]  You need to become authoritative.
[01:15:32.847 --> 01:15:34.188]  You need to become assertive.
[01:15:34.188 --> 01:15:34.829]  You need to commit!
[01:15:34.829 --> 01:15:38.592]  All right, I'm going to stop preaching.
[01:15:38.592 --> 01:15:41.154]  The point is, Lawrence, don't wait for a silver platter.
[01:15:41.154 --> 01:15:41.915]  And you haven't done that.
[01:15:41.915 --> 01:15:43.116]  You've written the book.
[01:15:43.116 --> 01:15:44.517]  Take action.
[01:15:44.517 --> 01:15:47.299]  Take action now while you're still alive.
[01:15:47.299 --> 01:15:49.561]  While you're sucking air.
[01:15:49.561 --> 01:15:51.643]  Let's talk to Jim in Texas.
[01:15:51.643 --> 01:15:52.584]  You're on the air, Jim.
[01:15:55.629 --> 01:15:56.390]  I'm all right, brother.
[01:15:56.390 --> 01:15:58.332]  What's on your mind today?
[01:15:58.332 --> 01:16:00.514]  Well, there's so much.
[01:16:00.514 --> 01:16:03.457]  I'll try to just touch on a couple of things.
[01:16:03.457 --> 01:16:13.809]  Sometimes an allegory, which is what you're talking about in The Matrix, can get through to a person's subconscious when they've been programmed or brainwashed, when facts cannot.
[01:16:15.089 --> 01:16:24.396]  That is the reason why stories such as The Matrix or you can even go back thousands of years to Socrates and Plato such as The Cave in The Republic, Chapter 7.
[01:16:24.396 --> 01:16:27.278]  Yeah, that's what The Truman Show is.
[01:16:27.278 --> 01:16:28.299]  Right, right.
[01:16:28.299 --> 01:16:35.524]  They're trying to expose all these things through fables and allegories because a lot of people, when they're subconsciously brainwashed,
[01:16:37.126 --> 01:16:43.712]  Now they're comfortable with their servitude because their subconscious brain is a lot more powerful than their conscious.
[01:16:43.712 --> 01:16:46.455]  So everybody knows they're in a Matrix slash Truman Show.
[01:16:46.455 --> 01:16:50.539]  They're in a Truman Show being inserted into an actual matrix.
[01:16:50.539 --> 01:16:55.924]  That's the Pentagon plan from the 1960s, declassified in January of 2000.
[01:16:55.924 --> 01:16:57.926]  But you're absolutely right.
[01:16:57.926 --> 01:16:58.667]  And go ahead.
[01:16:59.761 --> 01:17:26.976]  Well, Ma, I was just, uh, you know, I just find it really interesting that even Orwell, who, his real name, of course, was Eric Blair, who was, uh, the son of a British nobleman officer in the Bengal Wars, he learned early that this was all a fraud and whether you were told that socialism, communism, capitalism, or whatever was the way, it was all lies meant to deceive you because we were all being controlled by the same apex of the pyramid.
[01:17:28.013 --> 01:17:33.418]  And what are you talking about economically, socially, politically?
[01:17:33.418 --> 01:17:37.942]  It's all a Ponzi scheme based upon a pyramid scheme.
[01:17:37.942 --> 01:17:42.005]  That's what our whole world is, and I congratulate you on pointing that out.
[01:17:43.864 --> 01:17:46.786]  Uh, let me say to your earlier caller, Lawrence.
[01:17:46.786 --> 01:17:54.309]  Lawrence, there's been people since Socrates' time, or all the way back to, you know, you can go back to 1960 and read Vance Packard, uh, Wastemakers.
[01:17:54.309 --> 01:17:56.110]  There's so much information out there.
[01:17:56.110 --> 01:18:02.533]  Alex, you do the greatest job, by far, of, uh, enlightening people onto this stuff.
[01:18:02.533 --> 01:18:05.854]  But I hate to say it, my friend, we are losing.
[01:18:05.854 --> 01:18:09.436]  And we are casting, for the most part, our pearls before swine.
[01:18:10.498 --> 01:18:19.882]  And I believe right now is the time that the Lord Jesus Christ talked about when those who will listen had better flee these cities and prepare, because this is the last thing I want to say.
[01:18:19.882 --> 01:18:20.582]  Real history.
[01:18:20.582 --> 01:18:22.663]  This is real history.
[01:18:22.663 --> 01:18:34.047]  In World War II, from Stalingrad all the way to Warsaw, Danzig, all through the Eastern Bloc nations, those people were under siege for years in those cities.
[01:18:34.047 --> 01:18:36.488]  After the first year, there was nothing left to eat.
[01:18:36.488 --> 01:18:37.449]  They ate the rats.
[01:18:37.449 --> 01:18:38.329]  They ate the dead.
[01:18:39.551 --> 01:18:47.633]  After the second year, they were coming out in gangs, out of the sewers, and attacking and eating people by night.
[01:18:47.633 --> 01:18:49.353]  You people better wake up out there.
[01:18:49.353 --> 01:19:02.497]  You're not going to listen, but you better get the hell out of these big metropolitan cities and get yourself, to some degree, able to sustain yourself with water and food.
[01:19:02.497 --> 01:19:04.057]  And this is a final warning.
[01:19:04.057 --> 01:19:07.098]  I believe you're right, Alex, that World War III is right on the horizon.
[01:19:07.847 --> 01:19:27.156]  And that is the only way that these elite people have out of this... Every time they're going to lose power, Lord Milner in 1918 said, at the end of World War I, we're going to hire a German dictator and have him wreck Europe in the next 20 years, and they did it!
[01:19:27.156 --> 01:19:30.037]  I mean, the British intel put the Communists in!
[01:19:30.037 --> 01:19:35.660]  I mean, that's the reason they're so hard to beat, is they will
[01:19:36.840 --> 01:19:44.969]  They will hire Mao Zedong and have him kill 64 to 80 plus million, depending on the numbers you look at, just to get power.
[01:19:44.969 --> 01:19:45.870]  They enjoy it.
[01:19:45.870 --> 01:19:48.153]  Human life means nothing to them.
[01:19:48.153 --> 01:19:49.354]  And I agree with you.
[01:19:49.354 --> 01:19:50.956]  It is good to get self-sufficient.
[01:19:50.956 --> 01:19:52.557]  It is essential.
[01:19:52.557 --> 01:19:55.761]  And they are courting World War III right now.
[01:19:55.761 --> 01:19:57.703]  They are seriously looking at it.
[01:19:57.703 --> 01:19:58.304]  We'll be right back.
[01:20:01.798 --> 01:20:02.538]  The problem.
[01:20:02.538 --> 01:20:05.119]  How do I cook food without power?
[01:20:05.119 --> 01:20:07.820]  How do I light my home with no electricity?
[01:20:07.820 --> 01:20:10.501]  How do I get emergency radio broadcasts?
[01:20:10.501 --> 01:20:13.002]  How can I make safe drinking water?
[01:20:13.002 --> 01:20:22.006]  When your power goes out, the solution for cooking, baking, home lighting, listening to the radio, and producing clean water is the Family Emergency Kit from KaroStove.
[01:20:22.006 --> 01:20:24.667]  KaroStove has been in business for over 12 years with the

[01:20:56.657 --> 01:20:59.760]  KeroStove, for family emergency solutions.
[01:21:00.846 --> 01:21:06.169]  One major world crisis away from having a totalitarian type of system.
[01:21:06.169 --> 01:21:08.930]  The main event is the wholesale destruction of the world economy.
[01:21:08.930 --> 01:21:13.413]  The push for every nation on the globe to identify and number all of its citizens.
[01:21:14.301 --> 01:21:18.782]  Friends, I hope that you will order Shadow Government from Infowars.com.

[01:21:26.925 --> 01:21:35.027]  It exposes how a cashless society, surveillance beast grid of total control is being put into place.
[01:21:35.027 --> 01:21:36.888]  This film needs to be seen.
[01:21:36.888 --> 01:21:38.048]  Everybody needs to get it.

[01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:49.758]  Shadow Government.
[01:21:49.758 --> 01:21:52.000]  It gives Big Brother a black eye.
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:55.262]  Available at InfoWars.com or by calling toll-free 888-253-3139.
[01:22:00.535 --> 01:22:10.564]  Originally, we the people have entrusted government to be the guardians of currency, to ensure purity, content, weights and measures of gold and silver coins citizens would use for commerce.
[01:22:10.564 --> 01:22:17.010]  This reinstalled confidence after the demise of the fiat continental system, wisdom being lost with time.
[01:22:17.010 --> 01:22:25.858]  The government we once entrusted to protect from counterfeit has colluded with private business, creating the largest fiat counterfeiting scheme our country ever experienced.
[01:22:26.218 --> 01:22:35.425]  This is not only a transfer of power to an institution that is not accountable to our elected government, but has also caused the dollar to lose more than 90 cents of its original value.
[01:22:35.425 --> 01:22:40.428]  Now foreign governments are trying to divest themselves from this once world-reserved currency.
[01:22:40.428 --> 01:22:41.829]  Hi, this is Ted Anderson.
[01:22:41.829 --> 01:22:44.331]  I'm offering a book that explains how the system works.
[01:22:44.611 --> 01:22:47.934]  Call me today at 800-686-2237.
[01:22:47.934 --> 01:22:52.117]  I will give you a silver dollar free just for purchasing the book.
[01:22:52.117 --> 01:22:52.857]  Call today at 800-686-2237.
[01:22:52.857 --> 01:22:53.198]  Again, that's 800-686-2237.
[01:23:01.198 --> 01:23:04.203]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:23:04.203 --> 01:23:09.551]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:11.594]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:23:11.594 --> 01:23:16.362]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:23:16.582 --> 01:23:17.763]  How much do you want?
[01:23:17.763 --> 01:23:18.883]  When do you want it?
[01:23:18.883 --> 01:23:20.764]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:23:20.764 --> 01:23:21.845]  When will you need it?
[01:23:21.845 --> 01:23:24.046]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:23:24.046 --> 01:23:25.386]  Will there be any food?
[01:23:25.386 --> 01:23:26.907]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:23:26.907 --> 01:23:32.190]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:23:32.190 --> 01:23:34.531]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good
[01:23:34.531 --> 01:23:34.831]  Good to go!
[01:24:19.397 --> 01:24:33.281]  You know, Jim in Texas brought up World War III type scenarios, and a lot of mainline analysts say that a strike on Iran runs from bad to worse.
[01:24:33.281 --> 01:24:43.424]  I mean, they all agree that it runs from very serious repercussions to all-out thermal nuclear war with China and Russia.
[01:24:43.424 --> 01:24:49.026]  Now, the global is starting to move against Iran, unless they've gotten Russia and China to sign off on that.
[01:24:50.652 --> 01:25:01.496]  At least common sense would say that, but remember Cheney launched the 888 attack and it's now been declassified that he did want to start a nuclear war with Russia.
[01:25:01.496 --> 01:25:05.517]  So there's some truly insane people inside the power structure.
[01:25:05.517 --> 01:25:15.341]  The more insane, the more bold, the people with more bravado, more hubris, more chutzpah, whatever word you want to use.
[01:25:15.341 --> 01:25:17.021]  Crazy confidence.
[01:25:17.021 --> 01:25:18.482]  Tend to get into positions of power.
[01:25:19.605 --> 01:25:33.571]  And what concerns me is you see Dr. Eric Bianca, Dr. Peter Singer, Al Gore, all these different shows on Discovery Channel about the end of humanity, the end of humans, how great the world would be.
[01:25:33.571 --> 01:25:36.472]  I mean, here's two headlines today.
[01:25:36.472 --> 01:25:40.714]  Professor, only global governance can save us from a century of chaos.
[01:25:40.714 --> 01:25:41.955]  And that's out of the Daily Mail.
[01:25:43.587 --> 01:25:52.611]  And then the professor goes on to say total collapse by 2014 or before, a world war, that it will happen, that humans always do this.
[01:25:52.611 --> 01:25:55.433]  Well, the elites are implementing it right now.
[01:25:55.433 --> 01:25:56.553]  And I'm not just saying that.
[01:25:56.553 --> 01:25:59.735]  I have the Rand Corporation saying that they need a new war.
[01:25:59.735 --> 01:26:01.496]  I mean, you see them gearing up for it.
[01:26:01.496 --> 01:26:03.977]  You see them saying they're about to have a blockade of Iran.
[01:26:03.977 --> 01:26:07.719]  That's an act of war, as Ron Paul has said on the House floor.
[01:26:07.719 --> 01:26:09.359]  Not just me saying that.
[01:26:09.359 --> 01:26:10.300]  That's what the law says.
[01:26:13.817 --> 01:26:18.501]  Look at this, Harold's son, our own extinction is forecast within 100 years.
[01:26:18.501 --> 01:26:24.507]  But that's a good thing, the Australian basically reports, you read the whole article, because humans are bad.
[01:26:24.507 --> 01:26:26.629]  We're too stupid.
[01:26:26.629 --> 01:26:32.595]  See, the globalists are in hundreds of movies the last decade, literally hundreds, hundreds,
[01:26:34.676 --> 01:26:38.979]  It's gotta be 10 or 15 the last year about the end of the world and apocalypse.
[01:26:38.979 --> 01:26:45.582]  They are conditioning the subconscious mind to accept mass death and corruption so that you will just lay down and take it.
[01:26:45.582 --> 01:26:49.885]  Oh, it's the end of the world.
[01:26:49.885 --> 01:26:50.865]  Now, I am a Christian.
[01:26:50.865 --> 01:26:51.946]  I am Bible-believing.
[01:26:51.946 --> 01:26:57.269]  And I think it's very profound and makes Nostradamus look like a piker.
[01:26:57.269 --> 01:27:01.852]  But, it is misinterpreted and it is twisted and it is used
[01:27:03.054 --> 01:27:06.336]  Christians in Nazi Germany laid down because they thought it was the end of the world.
[01:27:06.336 --> 01:27:09.598]  Christians in China, most of them laid down, they thought it was the end of the world.
[01:27:09.598 --> 01:27:11.319]  They thought Mao was the Antichrist.
[01:27:11.319 --> 01:27:17.783]  Christians in North Korea are almost extinct because they think the Communist regime is the Antichrist.
[01:27:17.783 --> 01:27:20.605]  Well, in a way, if you actually read the Bible, it says there are many Antichrists.
[01:27:20.605 --> 01:27:26.809]  Antichrist spirit, but only one who will become world ruler.
[01:27:26.809 --> 01:27:29.451]  And whether you believe in God or not, the globalists are into the occult,
[01:27:30.620 --> 01:27:35.054]  The UN says they are going to have 10 global regions with 10 kingdoms.
[01:27:36.249 --> 01:27:39.210]  I mean, they are following Revelation as a blueprint.
[01:27:39.210 --> 01:28:00.254]  The world ID card, face scan, hand print to buy and sell, holograms, the beast computer speaking in Jerusalem and being seen by all the people of the world simultaneously, giant metal dragonflies and locusts dropping pillars of fire on cities.
[01:28:02.011 --> 01:28:07.980]  I mean, it's science fiction written almost 2,000 years ago on the Isle of Patmos.
[01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:15.171]  If John the Revelator was on a drug, I want some of what he was on.
[01:28:17.366 --> 01:28:23.087]  This isn't Isaac Asimov predicting high-tech systems 60 years ago, and he was a visionary.
[01:28:23.087 --> 01:28:29.788]  His foundation series is about computer programs being able to predict the future, which they already have now.
[01:28:29.788 --> 01:28:30.989]  That's admitted.
[01:28:30.989 --> 01:28:42.351]  They admit 93 to 97 percent accuracy in predicting where you're going to do, where you're going to go, how long you're going to stay somewhere, what you're going to do, with total precision.
[01:28:46.476 --> 01:28:50.860]  They're not telling you that they have it even more advanced.
[01:28:50.860 --> 01:28:52.861]  Near total precision.
[01:28:52.861 --> 01:28:55.043]  They're not telling you it's even more advanced.
[01:28:55.043 --> 01:28:59.427]  Off predictive mapping on how you behave, what you do.
[01:28:59.427 --> 01:29:03.170]  The government knows what website you're going to visit before you visit it.
[01:29:03.170 --> 01:29:05.291]  They know your rhythms.
[01:29:05.291 --> 01:29:05.692]  They know.
[01:29:08.237 --> 01:29:10.578]  Your patterns, they understand you.
[01:29:10.578 --> 01:29:16.079]  And so they are reaching a counterfeit level of omnipresence.
[01:29:16.079 --> 01:29:17.080]  It isn't real.
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:19.000]  They're still weak humans.
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:25.222]  They're still passion-driven by their id, by their ego, by their subconscious.
[01:29:25.222 --> 01:29:31.884]  They're still the wild beast, the wild primitive, out taking heads of their enemies.
[01:29:31.884 --> 01:29:35.065]  But now they've got atom bombs, hydrogen bombs.
[01:29:35.865 --> 01:29:38.608]  They've got computerized crystal balls.
[01:29:38.608 --> 01:29:42.492]  They've got superconducting, super-colliding cyclotrons.
[01:29:42.492 --> 01:29:44.354]  Now they've got space planes.
[01:29:44.354 --> 01:29:46.295]  Now they've got predictive computer systems.
[01:29:46.295 --> 01:29:48.398]  Now they've got race-specific bioweapons.
[01:29:48.398 --> 01:29:49.379]  They're Bill Gates!
[01:29:49.379 --> 01:29:50.820]  They're on power trips!
[01:29:50.820 --> 01:29:52.221]  We're on the march.
[01:29:52.221 --> 01:29:54.744]  The Empire's on the run.
[01:29:54.744 --> 01:29:57.427]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[01:30:01.448 --> 01:30:07.889]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.
[01:30:07.889 --> 01:30:13.170]  In this film, you will see the reasons why our government is failing and what you can do to prepare.
[01:30:13.170 --> 01:30:26.713]  Featuring Dr. Paul Craig Roberts, Joseph Farah, David Icke, Naomi Wolf, G. Edward Griffin, Doug McIntyre, Mark Crispin Miller, Mickey Z, Doug Casey, David McElhaney, and myself, Alex Jones.
[01:30:27.473 --> 01:30:32.515]  Protect yourself and get the tools you need to protect your family from these difficult times.

[01:30:42.718 --> 01:30:47.100]  Again, that website's www.thefallofamerica.net or call 800-655-1577.
[01:30:47.100 --> 01:30:49.221]  Prepare yourself and the ones you love today.
[01:30:49.221 --> 01:30:50.081]  fallofamerica.net
[01:31:00.694 --> 01:31:03.718]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[01:31:03.718 --> 01:31:09.045]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[01:31:09.045 --> 01:31:11.088]  My answer would be all I can get.
[01:31:11.088 --> 01:31:16.094]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[01:31:16.094 --> 01:31:17.276]  How much do you want?
[01:31:17.276 --> 01:31:18.017]  When do you want it?
[01:31:18.377 --> 01:31:20.279]  Now or after the battle starts?
[01:31:20.279 --> 01:31:21.340]  When will you need it?
[01:31:21.340 --> 01:31:23.542]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[01:31:23.542 --> 01:31:24.884]  Will there be any food?
[01:31:24.884 --> 01:31:26.425]  Will it make your children sick?
[01:31:26.425 --> 01:31:31.691]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[01:31:31.691 --> 01:31:34.814]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[01:31:35.254 --> 01:31:39.075]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[01:31:39.075 --> 01:31:40.295]  How much will you need?
[01:31:40.295 --> 01:31:41.215]  We don't know.
[01:31:41.215 --> 01:31:42.316]  How much do you want?
[01:31:42.316 --> 01:31:43.236]  All you can get.
[01:31:43.236 --> 01:31:44.336]  I'm Alex Jones.
[01:31:44.336 --> 01:31:47.377]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[01:31:47.377 --> 01:31:49.157]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[01:31:49.157 --> 01:31:50.077]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[01:32:01.547 --> 01:32:05.508]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones and I want to tell you about the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:05.508 --> 01:32:14.370]  Now you can produce pure and endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream by breathing the solution through the lungs.
[01:32:14.370 --> 01:32:18.991]  The respiratory system is the first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses.
[01:32:18.991 --> 01:32:29.813]  The Silver Lungs Generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano-silver solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the bloodstream.
[01:32:30.453 --> 01:32:39.955]  With continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver products, you can now produce pure and endless loyal silver with the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:39.955 --> 01:32:45.397]  Very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are provided, making production fast and simple.
[01:32:45.397 --> 01:32:52.878]  Go to www.SilverLungs.com today and learn more about the breakthrough technology of the Silver Lungs Generator.
[01:32:52.878 --> 01:32:55.639]  That's www.SilverLungs.com.
[01:33:07.700 --> 01:33:10.661]  Alright, I'm going to continue with your phone calls.
[01:33:10.661 --> 01:33:14.602]  Ernie, Wayne, David, Truthmaster, and others.
[01:33:14.602 --> 01:33:22.765]  Call the free number to join us on air, 1-800-259-9231.
[01:33:22.765 --> 01:33:30.547]  And of course the websites are InfoWars.net, JonesReport.com, PrisonPlanet.tv, InfoWars.com, and PrisonPlanet.com.
[01:33:32.233 --> 01:33:34.835]  Let me read over some financial headlines here.
[01:33:34.835 --> 01:33:39.359]  Crude oil drops, gold rises after jobless claims.
[01:33:39.359 --> 01:33:42.541]  Gold is up a whole lot today.
[01:33:42.541 --> 01:33:45.183]  In fact, let me just actually pull up the latest on gold.
[01:33:45.183 --> 01:33:48.686]  I haven't looked at that in about 20 minutes.
[01:33:48.686 --> 01:33:52.609]  It's hard to do this live on air, but we'll do it.
[01:33:52.609 --> 01:33:56.933]  Gold, as if you can't do this yourself.
[01:33:56.933 --> 01:33:57.553]  Let's go ahead.
[01:33:57.553 --> 01:33:59.375]  Well, I wanna know, so I'm gonna find out right now.
[01:34:01.420 --> 01:34:04.022]  Gold is up $17.10 today to $1,247 an ounce.
[01:34:04.022 --> 01:34:09.647]  Crude oil fell and gold futures stayed higher Thursday after the Labor Department said U.S.
[01:34:09.647 --> 01:34:11.388]  jobless claims rose by 12,000 last week.
[01:34:11.388 --> 01:34:12.369]  Crude oil for July
[01:34:22.878 --> 01:34:25.139]  Delivery fell 76 cents or 1% to $76.91 a barrel.
[01:34:25.139 --> 01:34:26.659]  The August contract fell 36 cents to $78.36 a barrel.
[01:34:26.659 --> 01:34:28.760]  And gold for August delivery gained $15 to $1,245.50 an ounce.
[01:34:28.760 --> 01:34:31.081]  So they're doing everything they can to suppress it.
[01:34:44.912 --> 01:34:58.279]  Because it exposes fiat currencies as the dangerous frauds they are, and other forms of paper that the hedge fund lords who run the New World Order have gotten so rich off of.
[01:34:58.279 --> 01:35:07.024]  They're not going to be able to make 5, 10, 15 million dollars a piece, the hundreds of these different scallywags every year, if you become wise and stop buying their derivatives.
[01:35:10.777 --> 01:35:18.740]  Anybody can go out on the street corner and say, you know, they'll give you a trillion dollar bill for a thousand dollars, then you try to cash the trillion dollar bill and find out it's worthless.
[01:35:18.740 --> 01:35:26.083]  But see, only a select group of scammers, the Ivy League crooks, are allowed to engage in this.
[01:35:26.083 --> 01:35:32.026]  You're not part of the money laundering slash counterfeiting scheme.
[01:35:32.026 --> 01:35:33.666]  Only the central banks are.
[01:35:33.666 --> 01:35:37.888]  One hundred Italian economists say austerity will destroy Europe.
[01:35:40.589 --> 01:35:45.973]  You know, I'm really proud of my film, The Obama Deception, made a year and a half ago.
[01:35:45.973 --> 01:35:47.874]  Right when Obama got in office.
[01:35:47.874 --> 01:35:54.179]  Because it's all about austerity, and all about how they're going to raise your taxes and cut your benefits, before Obama was talking about that!
[01:35:54.179 --> 01:35:55.900]  Because we know what the IMF and World Bank do!
[01:35:55.900 --> 01:35:59.123]  The people that run Obama!
[01:35:59.123 --> 01:36:04.267]  Real name, Barry Sitaro, the Indonesian citizen of Kenyan Providence.
[01:36:06.338 --> 01:36:13.379]  100 Italian economists say austerity will destroy Europe from zero hedge up on InfoWars.com.
[01:36:13.379 --> 01:36:30.483]  The Telegraph's Ambrose Evans Pritchard points to a letter signed by 100 Italian economists who point out the Ponzi scheme is taking place in which they note that the austerity strategy imposed by Brussels, Frankfurt risk tipping Europe into a self-feeding downward spiral.
[01:36:30.483 --> 01:36:31.383]  That's the plan!
[01:36:33.226 --> 01:36:35.707]  So what if you have a hundred top economists saying that?
[01:36:35.707 --> 01:36:38.008]  That's the plan.
[01:36:38.008 --> 01:36:53.234]  That's like if they boss it into a shack and Ted Bundy was over a ten-year-old girl biting huge bloody chunks out of her back and you said, Ted Bundy, you're going to kill her if you... He goes, that's the point!
[01:36:53.234 --> 01:36:56.615]  I mean, it's crazy to not understand that.
[01:36:56.615 --> 01:36:57.996]  It's Woody Woodpecker nuts.
[01:36:59.358 --> 01:37:02.184]  Again, gold prices in the futures reach $1,254 an ounce.
[01:37:02.184 --> 01:37:02.966]  Federal Reserve pushes
[01:37:10.097 --> 01:37:11.998]  Up the debt and purchases U.S.
[01:37:11.998 --> 01:37:12.618]  sovereign debt.
[01:37:12.618 --> 01:37:15.338]  We got Bob Chapman on tomorrow about that.
[01:37:15.338 --> 01:37:18.579]  And so you have the Federal Reserve more and more buying its own debt.
[01:37:18.579 --> 01:37:20.880]  But then more debt's created for us.
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:24.301]  The Treasury offers money and the Federal Reserve comes in and buys it itself.
[01:37:24.301 --> 01:37:31.202]  And that was one of the best lines last night out of Slimeballs, this little special that they hyped for a month.
[01:37:31.202 --> 01:37:35.823]  Was that they said, some people in the Tea Party want to get rid of all government.
[01:37:35.823 --> 01:37:36.904]  They say it's a tyranny.
[01:37:36.904 --> 01:37:38.264]  They cut to me saying, it's a tyranny.
[01:37:39.921 --> 01:37:42.522]  Some people want to get rid of all government.
[01:37:42.522 --> 01:37:44.442]  They want it in the Fed.
[01:37:44.442 --> 01:37:52.885]  And then they cut to Rand Paul saying, in the Fed, in a speech, knowing the average moron that watches MSNBC.
[01:37:52.885 --> 01:38:00.607]  I mean, you've really got to be a moron if you watch MSNBC and you believe that that isn't cartoon-level propaganda.
[01:38:00.607 --> 01:38:03.888]  It's more cartoonish than Fox News now.
[01:38:03.888 --> 01:38:05.649]  Because it's defending the establishment.
[01:38:05.649 --> 01:38:09.350]  It seemed a little more sane when it was playing the part of the anti-establishment during Bush.
[01:38:10.444 --> 01:38:14.166]  Now, Fox seems more sane playing the part of the anti-establishment.
[01:38:14.166 --> 01:38:17.868]  As soon as the Republicans back in, they'll be pro-establishment.
[01:38:17.868 --> 01:38:23.211]  But, I mean, did you miss what I just said, some of you out there that are new listeners?
[01:38:23.211 --> 01:38:24.772]  It's very simple.
[01:38:24.772 --> 01:38:28.595]  In the Fed means in the private Federal Reserve.
[01:38:28.595 --> 01:38:39.341]  But Chris Matthews, and this is a quote, says some people want to get rid of all government, abolish government entirely, and they want to abolish the Federal Reserve, and then they cut
[01:38:40.936 --> 01:38:54.030]  To Rand Paul saying in the Fed, in the Fed Channing it, knowing that one sentence before he said some of these people want to get rid of all government.
[01:38:54.030 --> 01:39:00.537]  Then he says, like the Federal Reserve, as if Federal Reserve is government, then they cut to Rand Paul saying,
[01:39:01.693 --> 01:39:03.013]  In the Fed.
[01:39:03.013 --> 01:39:04.714]  See, so that's a double lie.
[01:39:04.714 --> 01:39:15.076]  They're telling you the Federal Reserve is government, and is legitimate, and that Rand Paul wants to abolish all government, and that to end the Fed means to abolish all government.
[01:39:15.076 --> 01:39:19.838]  But in a sick little lawyer way, they love having what they say be the truth from one perspective.
[01:39:19.838 --> 01:39:20.678]  Of course, it's a lie.
[01:39:23.168 --> 01:39:24.309]  But it is true.
[01:39:24.309 --> 01:39:26.350]  The Fed is the only government.
[01:39:26.350 --> 01:39:28.552]  It runs the military, it runs the entire country.
[01:39:28.552 --> 01:39:34.136]  The private bankers that took over 97 years ago, in 1913.
[01:39:34.136 --> 01:39:36.878]  So we have that here.
[01:39:36.878 --> 01:39:37.478]  Here's another one.
[01:39:37.478 --> 01:39:40.280]  Government expanding like a cancer, says Mark Faber.
[01:39:40.280 --> 01:39:46.165]  Well, that's how I always describe it.
[01:39:46.165 --> 01:39:47.125]  But see, they're globalists.
[01:39:47.125 --> 01:39:50.408]  They will evacuate the country after they've sucked it dry and broke it down.
[01:39:51.926 --> 01:39:54.107]  Government expanding like a cancer, Mark Faber says.
[01:39:54.107 --> 01:40:04.631]  Governments have intervened too much in the free market since the crisis started, to the point that they are affecting the health of the world economy, Mark Faber, the author of the gloom, boom, doom report, told CNBC.
[01:40:04.631 --> 01:40:08.853]  Of course, he's predicted all of what's happening and is a frequent guest of this transmission.
[01:40:08.853 --> 01:40:14.976]  Here is another headline along those same lines.
[01:40:22.082 --> 01:40:23.486]  Trying to find my headline.
[01:40:23.486 --> 01:40:24.529]  I had a headline here.
[01:40:28.590 --> 01:40:30.171]  Oh yes, here it is.
[01:40:30.171 --> 01:40:32.272]  This is from CNBC.
[01:40:32.272 --> 01:40:34.793]  Serious market problems in the fall.
[01:40:34.793 --> 01:40:38.475]  Gold to hit $2,500 an ounce is the headline.
[01:40:38.475 --> 01:40:52.942]  And here to talk more about this article with us for the next five minutes, and I'm going right back to your calls, is Ted Anderson of Myers Resources, also owns the Genesis Network, and he's who I trust to buy my precious metals from, and who I do buy them from, because it's the best deal out there.
[01:40:52.942 --> 01:40:54.823]  The offers we give on this show
[01:40:55.723 --> 01:40:58.205]  Are the best offers out there, bar none.
[01:40:58.205 --> 01:41:00.306]  Now you need to make sure you say it's the Alex Jones Special.
[01:41:00.306 --> 01:41:03.388]  Take advantage of these.
[01:41:03.388 --> 01:41:09.351]  But if you're not moving some of your paper into gold and silver, I don't know what planet you're living on.
[01:41:09.351 --> 01:41:11.233]  Gold just seven years ago was $260-something an ounce.
[01:41:11.233 --> 01:41:12.033]  Now it's $1,247.60 and climbing.
[01:41:12.033 --> 01:41:14.335]  And mainstream news is having to admit $2,500.
[01:41:14.335 --> 01:41:15.655]  By the way, that's a conservative
[01:41:25.121 --> 01:41:27.101]  I don't own gold because of that.
[01:41:27.101 --> 01:41:29.402]  I don't own it to go cash it in.
[01:41:29.402 --> 01:41:30.222]  I don't cash gold.
[01:41:30.222 --> 01:41:30.982]  I bought it $300.
[01:41:30.982 --> 01:41:31.682]  I don't buy gold.
[01:41:31.682 --> 01:41:33.142]  I bought it $1,200.
[01:41:33.142 --> 01:41:34.243]  I don't sell silver.
[01:41:34.243 --> 01:41:36.463]  I bought it $5 an ounce with it at $19.
[01:41:36.463 --> 01:41:39.503]  I don't sell it.
[01:41:39.503 --> 01:41:43.644]  It's an emergency backup because you can't trust in government.
[01:41:43.644 --> 01:41:51.786]  You can't trust in anything in this world but God, guts, and guns, and gold.
[01:41:51.786 --> 01:41:52.786]  The G's.
[01:41:52.786 --> 01:41:53.726]  Let's bring up
[01:41:55.592 --> 01:41:56.332]  Ted Anderson.
[01:41:56.332 --> 01:41:59.933]  Ted, again, you've got great offers for people yet again.
[01:41:59.933 --> 01:42:05.174]  With your 30-plus years in the business, most outlets are out or have giant premiums on gold.
[01:42:05.174 --> 01:42:06.354]  That's all over the news.
[01:42:06.354 --> 01:42:11.515]  But not Ted Anderson, because you're in it for the long haul, and so you've got the best deals.
[01:42:11.515 --> 01:42:12.555]  Ted, tell us about it.
[01:42:12.555 --> 01:42:13.576]  Yeah, I sure will.
[01:42:13.576 --> 01:42:24.118]  I tell you, that Frank and Forecaster offer, I'm still holding that down at $265, despite the fact that gold has gone up off that $1,200, and now it's trading at that $1,217.
[01:42:25.831 --> 01:42:26.111]  I don't know.
[01:42:51.644 --> 01:42:55.028]  You do get the full year of the International Forecaster for that.
[01:42:55.028 --> 01:42:57.191]  You just can't beat that deal.
[01:42:57.191 --> 01:42:59.214]  With the discount of the Forecaster newsletter at $159...
[01:43:01.252 --> 01:43:04.253]  It gets you down below $500 an ounce for gold.
[01:43:04.253 --> 01:43:05.713]  I mean, that's a fifth of an ounce of gold.
[01:43:05.713 --> 01:43:07.413]  You can do the math.
[01:43:07.413 --> 01:43:12.654]  But silver right now is just touching, getting real close to $19 an ounce.
[01:43:12.654 --> 01:43:18.095]  And I'm going to have to start moving up the price on those Walking Liberty halves, if people are interested in that.
[01:43:18.095 --> 01:43:21.516]  That coin right now is $9.75.
[01:43:21.516 --> 01:43:25.937]  And that coin, I know my internet prices have jumped up over $10.
[01:43:25.937 --> 01:43:28.117]  I'm just holding that price down, too.
[01:43:28.117 --> 01:43:30.878]  Alex, I'm going to sell that Buffalo coin until I can't no more.
[01:43:31.560 --> 01:43:33.761]  There's a small supply out there in the marketplace.
[01:43:33.761 --> 01:43:37.122]  I have some, you know, some quantity.
[01:43:37.122 --> 01:43:39.023]  As long as I can deliver them, I'm going to sell them.
[01:43:39.023 --> 01:43:41.924]  I'm going to recommend people buy that coin too.
[01:43:41.924 --> 01:43:44.365]  Just because of the fact that it's, you know, the U.S.
[01:43:44.365 --> 01:43:48.407]  Mint makes such a small number of them, and then when they get sold out, they're just gone.
[01:43:48.407 --> 01:43:51.988]  I mean, most of last year, you couldn't buy a Buffalo coin.
[01:43:51.988 --> 01:43:52.389]  These are the 2010s.
[01:43:53.869 --> 01:43:57.151]  And they are just scarce, really hard to get.
[01:43:57.151 --> 01:43:58.391]  I have a supply of them.
[01:43:58.391 --> 01:43:59.191]  I'm going to sell them.
[01:43:59.191 --> 01:44:00.272]  So if you're interested in buying them.
[01:44:00.272 --> 01:44:00.592]  That's right.
[01:44:00.592 --> 01:44:00.772]  The U.S.
[01:44:00.772 --> 01:44:03.853]  Mint puts out a limited number and they run out very, very quickly.
[01:44:03.853 --> 01:44:05.274]  And these just came out.
[01:44:05.274 --> 01:44:06.314]  They're being snatched up.
[01:44:06.314 --> 01:44:08.575]  And Ted's got a great price on those.
[01:44:08.575 --> 01:44:08.635]  800-686-2237.
[01:44:08.635 --> 01:44:11.497]  800-686-2237 is the toll-free number to call and talk to the brokers.
[01:44:11.497 --> 01:44:14.538]  Any other coins, Ted, that people should know about?
[01:44:21.681 --> 01:44:23.342]  Yeah, you know, the U.S.
[01:44:23.342 --> 01:44:25.584]  Eagles, bags of junk silver are real popular.
[01:44:25.584 --> 01:44:27.646]  That stuff is getting incredibly scarce.
[01:44:27.646 --> 01:44:32.070]  For those of you who don't know what those are, that's the dimes and the quarters and the halves.
[01:44:32.070 --> 01:44:36.253]  They're really scarce and very close to melt value.
[01:44:36.253 --> 01:44:42.739]  When Paulson and Bush were talking about the TARP money, they became completely unavailable.
[01:44:42.739 --> 01:44:44.240]  They were just sold out completely.
[01:44:44.240 --> 01:44:45.781]  There was none available.
[01:44:45.781 --> 01:44:48.444]  It was hard to get a hundred ounce silver bar for crying out loud.
[01:44:48.444 --> 01:44:49.965]  So that's a really good buy as well.
[01:44:50.205 --> 01:45:01.987]  I mean, there's a lot of products out there, Alex, that I'm getting my hands on, and I just don't have enough time on the air to mention them all, but I would suggest that if you're interested in looking at gold and silver, like you said, Alex, this is summertime.
[01:45:01.987 --> 01:45:06.348]  Right now, we're seeing the soft side of the market, not the bullish side.
[01:45:06.348 --> 01:45:11.829]  Come August, September, October, I mean, I say this every year with you, and every year it's true.
[01:45:11.829 --> 01:45:14.370]  Gold and silver are very hot in the fall.
[01:45:14.810 --> 01:45:17.151]  Right now, you're seeing a bit of a bull market.
[01:45:17.151 --> 01:45:20.252]  Gold is reaching highs that it's never seen before.
[01:45:20.252 --> 01:45:22.572]  Silver's coming up and touching its highs.
[01:45:22.572 --> 01:45:40.358]  And I gotta tell ya, this fall, there's so much trouble in the economy right now, and you take a look ahead and you put any one of those little time bombs that are about to pop in that particular time frame, right between August, September, October, November, I mean, gold skyrockets during that time, and that's when you see that.
[01:45:40.358 --> 01:45:42.459]  I mean, they're talking about $2,500 an ounce.
[01:45:44.179 --> 01:45:45.420]  That's possible.
[01:45:45.420 --> 01:45:50.525]  It does happen, and it happens that volatilely, like you have that in the fall.
[01:45:50.525 --> 01:45:52.648]  And that's what we're coming up... Well, regardless, Ted, look...
[01:45:55.697 --> 01:45:59.881]  People need to start moving out of paper, and you bought this gold and it was at a lower price.
[01:45:59.881 --> 01:46:04.927]  You're passing it on with a lower price, as you always do, but it's about to go up again.
[01:46:04.927 --> 01:46:07.769]  So ladies and gentlemen, take advantage of this now.
[01:46:07.769 --> 01:46:07.829]  800-686-2237.
[01:46:07.829 --> 01:46:07.910]  800-686-2237.
[01:46:07.910 --> 01:46:09.451]  Ted, thanks for coming on with us.
[01:46:09.451 --> 01:46:10.412]  Yeah, thanks for having me up, Alex.
[01:46:16.417 --> 01:46:20.541]  You bet, and I wanted to briefly go over some of this CNBC article.
[01:46:20.541 --> 01:46:26.628]  The headline is, Serious Market Problems in the Fall, Gold to Hit $2,500 an Ounce.
[01:46:26.628 --> 01:46:32.114]  Now that's CNBC saying that, not Alex Jones.
[01:46:32.114 --> 01:46:33.756]  I quite frankly hope it doesn't hit that.
[01:46:35.322 --> 01:46:42.484]  Because if it does go to $2,500, which is what it's supposed to be due to inflation, that means that our worst fears are coming true.
[01:46:42.484 --> 01:46:45.105]  And obviously, you can feel it in your gut.
[01:46:45.105 --> 01:46:46.445]  You can see it.
[01:46:46.445 --> 01:46:48.706]  This is a depression.
[01:46:48.706 --> 01:46:52.667]  And I guess it's good to have a life raft.
[01:46:52.667 --> 01:46:57.028]  And gold financially, in every case in history, is that life raft.
[01:46:57.028 --> 01:46:58.589]  But it says stocks fell on
[01:47:01.513 --> 01:47:12.735]  Tuesday has reports that jobless claims jumped last week and the Philly Fed gauge of manufacturing activity tumbled.
[01:47:15.936 --> 01:47:27.346]  And it goes on, a Christian Fawadis, President and Chief Executive of Sentinel Asset Management, and Paul Schwartz, President of Hedge Capital, shared their views.
[01:47:27.346 --> 01:47:36.173]  Since we had the big May correction, the market has been dominated entirely by macroeconomic and political events.
[01:47:36.173 --> 01:47:39.917]  When that happens, the market fundamentals tend to get pushed down.
[01:47:39.917 --> 01:47:42.239]  They went on to say that economic news so far has not
[01:47:43.098 --> 01:47:48.680]  I mean, bad, and will support a possible 2-3% GDP growth.
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:48:01.723]  They went on to say that they think that you see $1,500 later this year and somewhere around $2,000 to $2,500 in this decade, he said.
[01:48:01.723 --> 01:48:03.504]  So we'll see what happens with that.
[01:48:03.504 --> 01:48:11.106]  That's from CNBC, who I think has a typo, because this is today's news, and it says Tuesday.
[01:48:11.106 --> 01:48:12.006]  It's Thursday, folks.
[01:48:14.602 --> 01:48:19.443]  Oh, they're just bringing in news articles in here so fast I can't even keep track of them.
[01:48:19.443 --> 01:48:20.924]  Let's go ahead and go back to your calls.
[01:48:20.924 --> 01:48:21.984]  Thanks for holding, Ernie.
[01:48:21.984 --> 01:48:22.664]  You're on the air.
[01:48:22.664 --> 01:48:23.744]  Welcome.
[01:48:23.744 --> 01:48:24.225]  Hey, Alex.
[01:48:24.225 --> 01:48:24.825]  Hey.
[01:48:24.825 --> 01:48:32.487]  One thing about your last caller talking about the people I feel bad about is people who never farm, don't know how to pluck a chicken, don't know how to skin it.
[01:48:32.487 --> 01:48:33.727]  Those are the people that are in trouble.
[01:48:33.727 --> 01:48:37.428]  Okay, the two things I want to talk about, Blagojevich is right on.
[01:48:37.428 --> 01:48:39.649]  I think you did a good CYA job.
[01:48:39.649 --> 01:48:40.289]  Bring them all down.
[01:48:40.905 --> 01:48:42.307]  The other two things that bother me.
[01:48:42.307 --> 01:48:49.915]  We got a president, we got a crack in the ocean with an oil well, and he sits there and looks at the American people and says, we gotta tax you.
[01:48:49.915 --> 01:49:01.068]  The other thing that bothers me is watching a congressman assault two kids on the street, they spin and flip it, and then in South Carolina they elect another guy to go for Congress who can't even speak English?
[01:49:02.116 --> 01:49:03.016]  This guy Green?
[01:49:03.016 --> 01:49:06.478]  It's like you're talking... This is just all bizarre.
[01:49:06.478 --> 01:49:13.182]  Well, sir, in a New York City, I have the AP article and as I read this Wednesday, I couldn't believe it.
[01:49:14.144 --> 01:49:15.565]  I haven't even gotten to it.
[01:49:15.565 --> 01:49:33.419]  The feds came into the town and it turns out they've been in hundreds of towns and said we think one man one vote is racist so we're going to give six votes to certain people to get illegal aliens elected and they admit that it's illegal aliens voting and the feds say they deserve to vote.
[01:49:33.419 --> 01:49:34.460]  I mean you cannot
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:37.543]  Make up stuff this insane.
[01:49:37.543 --> 01:49:39.485]  This is a criminal government.
[01:49:39.485 --> 01:49:50.537]  Again, I'm not against the illegal aliens, folks, but the government has brought them in as a political weapon to displace the American people and to vote for the robbery against the people.
[01:49:51.498 --> 01:49:55.341]  And, uh, I mean, it's just, it's treason.
[01:49:55.341 --> 01:49:57.442]  We have a treasonous government.
[01:49:57.442 --> 01:50:11.792]  And to watch that senator beat up some college students, literally punch their camera, grab them, the young men are polite the entire time, and then I've got the MSNBC Chris Matthews piece and other shows saying how dare them attack
[01:50:12.552 --> 01:50:13.932]  The Senator.
[01:50:13.932 --> 01:50:16.033]  But that's, look, that's the way it works now.
[01:50:16.033 --> 01:50:18.933]  Cops attack you, you get charged with attacking them.
[01:50:18.933 --> 01:50:22.494]  Even if there's video of the cops hitting you, you don't touch them.
[01:50:22.494 --> 01:50:25.774]  They show it to a jury and they say police are God.
[01:50:25.774 --> 01:50:29.055]  And the jury says police are God and you go to prison.
[01:50:29.055 --> 01:50:34.496]  And now if a Senator beats you, rapes your wife, they will say your wife raped them.
[01:50:34.496 --> 01:50:37.396]  I mean, and I'm not being sarcastic about that.
[01:50:37.396 --> 01:50:40.277]  Government is God in a tyranny.
[01:50:41.511 --> 01:50:42.833]  And good points, Ernie.
[01:50:42.833 --> 01:50:45.797]  Wayne, David, Truthmaster, Mark, I'm going to go to you quickly.
[01:50:45.797 --> 01:50:48.361]  On the other side, there's so much news coming up.
[01:50:48.361 --> 01:50:57.934]  I want to get into all these professors and government officials talking about the end of the world and NASA saying, you know, the sun could kill us and all this hype and humanity will be extinct.
[01:50:58.815 --> 01:50:59.976]  They're hyping it.
[01:50:59.976 --> 01:51:00.896]  Why are they hyping it?
[01:51:00.896 --> 01:51:02.657]  Normal blood pressure, naturally.
[01:51:02.657 --> 01:51:03.997]  How would that make you feel?
[01:51:03.997 --> 01:51:05.718]  I'm Don from New Mexico.
[01:51:05.718 --> 01:51:08.259]  January of 2000, I had a heart attack.
[01:51:08.259 --> 01:51:15.823]  Then my real health began going downhill, and I had high blood pressure, high blood sugar, poor vision, and I really wasn't sleeping well.
[01:51:15.823 --> 01:51:17.303]  I was a mess, pretty much.
[01:51:17.303 --> 01:51:20.065]  Don reports dramatic improvements with heart and body extract.
[01:51:20.065 --> 01:51:25.087]  I started taking heart and body extract, and from within a few days, I started sleeping a lot better.
[01:51:25.347 --> 01:51:30.432]  My blood pressure normalized, my blood sugar normalized, and my sleep really did improve.
[01:51:47.106 --> 01:51:48.187]  I did not expect this at all.
[01:51:48.187 --> 01:51:52.912]  By the 7th, 8th, and 9th day, I saw dramatic improvements from taking Hardened Body Extract.
[01:51:52.912 --> 01:51:56.055]  Details at HBextract.com or call 866-295-5305 for Hardened Body Extract.
[01:52:00.620 --> 01:52:01.920]  Hi, this is Alex Jones.
[01:52:01.920 --> 01:52:07.501]  Did you know that the global elite are now storing non-hybrid seeds in secret storage vaults near the Arctic Circle?
[01:52:07.501 --> 01:52:12.522]  Did you know that in a real meltdown, non-hybrid seeds could become more valuable than silver or gold?
[01:52:12.522 --> 01:52:13.003]  It's true.
[01:52:13.003 --> 01:52:18.084]  Seeds have outperformed even gold and silver before in this country, and it's possible that could even happen again.
[01:52:18.084 --> 01:52:23.325]  So our friends at Solutions from Science have put together the perfect mix of non-hybrid seeds.
[01:52:23.325 --> 01:52:25.185]  They call it a survival seed bank.
[01:52:25.632 --> 01:52:30.436]  And it can produce an endless supply of nutrient-dense food for you and your family.
[01:52:30.436 --> 01:52:31.557]  And here's the best part.
[01:52:31.557 --> 01:52:34.599]  These seeds have not been genetically modified in any way.
[01:52:34.599 --> 01:52:38.242]  And you actually get enough seeds to plant a full acre crisis garden.
[01:52:38.242 --> 01:52:41.424]  So visit them today at survivalseedbank.com.
[01:52:41.424 --> 01:52:43.646]  That's survivalseedbank.com.

[01:52:44.747 --> 01:52:45.908]  Remember, in a real crisis,
[01:52:54.727 --> 01:52:57.289]  Non-hybrid seeds are the ultimate barter item.
[01:52:57.289 --> 01:53:00.812]  This is Alex Jones for survivalseedbank.com.

[01:54:28.257 --> 01:54:30.779]  As we start the next hour, let's go to Wayne in Canada.
[01:54:30.779 --> 01:54:33.040]  Wayne, thanks for holding her on the air.
[01:54:33.040 --> 01:54:34.401]  Thanks for taking my call, Alex.
[01:54:34.401 --> 01:54:35.722]  I appreciate everything you do.
[01:54:35.722 --> 01:54:37.263]  I want to thank you for it.
[01:54:37.263 --> 01:54:38.224]  I want to move quickly.
[01:54:38.224 --> 01:54:49.351]  I want to ask you to, or make a suggestion that your listeners search Edward Mandel House and what he has to say.
[01:54:50.504 --> 01:54:55.647]  It's very informative and interesting to see what he had to say.
[01:54:55.647 --> 01:54:59.028]  Yeah, House Park here in Austin.
[01:54:59.028 --> 01:54:59.849]  He was from Austin.
[01:54:59.849 --> 01:55:01.930]  He was the handler of Woodrow Wilson.
[01:55:01.930 --> 01:55:08.193]  Openly said, we're going to have a new British Empire, a planetary government, and bankrupt the American people through taxation.
[01:55:08.193 --> 01:55:12.895]  And he wrote books about it, bragging about how they destroy America, and now they've done it.
[01:55:12.895 --> 01:55:20.059]  Yes, and if you just Google, Edward Mandel House has to say, or any search engine,
[01:55:20.521 --> 01:55:26.304]  It's a really brief read, and it'll tell you how forever to remain economic slaves.
[01:55:26.304 --> 01:55:30.286]  This applies to the world, not only to the United States.
[01:55:30.286 --> 01:55:32.346]  We're all corporations.
[01:55:32.346 --> 01:55:34.608]  If you could Google that, maybe you could read it.
[01:55:34.608 --> 01:55:48.614]  And my second point is, I want to go to the Bilderberg meeting of this year in June of 2000, and the list of it, and ask the people in the Corporation of British Columbia
[01:55:49.468 --> 01:55:58.232]  To go to that list and see down to the 17th name of that list is Gordon Campbell, Premier of British Columbia.
[01:55:58.232 --> 01:56:16.140]  And I ask all people within the Corporation of the Province of British Columbia to go to their local MLAs and ask what our so-called elected representative Gordon Campbell was doing at this Bilderberg meeting and what good
[01:56:17.492 --> 01:56:22.873]  For the people of the people elected by the people he was acquiring at this meeting.
[01:56:23.905 --> 01:56:27.588]  Well, it's just like most of your past prime ministers.
[01:56:27.588 --> 01:56:39.116]  He's being vetted to be prime minister in the future, just like Tony Blair, just like Barack Obama, just like Bill Clinton, just like George Bush Sr., just like the governor of Texas, Rick Perry.
[01:56:39.116 --> 01:56:45.700]  You know, they've got different political affiliations, different political coloration, but they're all New World Order criminal trash.
[01:56:45.700 --> 01:56:47.521]  I appreciate your call, Wayne.
[01:56:48.622 --> 01:56:49.182]  I really do.
[01:56:49.182 --> 01:56:50.062]  Good points that you made.
[01:56:50.062 --> 01:57:08.147]  Of course, don't forget in Canada, what this year and two years before that, your Parliament tried to actually be a Parliament, and tried to actually cut taxes, and the Queen exercised her Governor General's veto and disbanded the authority of the Parliament, just like it's happened in Australia.
[01:57:08.147 --> 01:57:11.268]  You run absolutely nothing, and we run nothing here.
[01:57:12.328 --> 01:57:26.095]  Our Congress is ceremonial to the Federal Reserve, and the Congress is trying to become effective again and audit the Fed, and so the Fed threatens financial terror and plunged the market a thousand points that day.
[01:57:26.095 --> 01:57:36.481]  We're gonna go to break here and come back with David Truthmaster, Mark Scott and others, and then after, actually I go to Scott first, he disagrees.
[01:57:36.481 --> 01:57:38.602]  We'll see if it's like all the other people that disagree though.
[01:57:38.602 --> 01:57:40.043]  I think you're a great patriot, but
[01:57:41.314 --> 01:57:44.517]  I really love to hear somebody that actually disagreed, but had real meat and potatoes.
[01:58:03.922 --> 01:58:10.170]  People wouldn't believe it if they knew who controlled our military according to his oil company connections that I know are real.
[01:58:10.170 --> 01:58:14.415]  And so we'll get him to flesh that out with us coming up in the last hour today.
[01:58:14.415 --> 01:58:15.957]  You want him, you got him.
[01:58:15.957 --> 01:58:22.966]  But in closing, don't forget this entire radio transmission is funded by your support of the sponsors and by purchasing the books.
[01:58:23.206 --> 01:58:41.079]  Videos, t-shirts, at InfoWars.com, like Invisible Empire, A New World Order Defined, our newest film, such an important documentary, or other films we carry like Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, all available at InfoWars.com, and I want to thank you all for your support.

[01:58:50.319 --> 01:58:54.862]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[01:58:54.862 --> 01:58:55.782]  Number 1.
[01:58:55.782 --> 01:58:59.205]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[01:58:59.205 --> 01:59:00.065]  Number 2.
[01:59:00.065 --> 01:59:04.948]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[01:59:04.948 --> 01:59:05.709]  It's true.
[01:59:05.709 --> 01:59:10.572]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[01:59:10.572 --> 01:59:11.392]  Number 3.
[01:59:11.392 --> 01:59:14.995]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[01:59:14.995 --> 01:59:18.677]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[01:59:18.877 --> 01:59:19.677]  Number 4.
[01:59:19.677 --> 01:59:22.438]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[01:59:22.438 --> 01:59:26.120]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[01:59:26.120 --> 01:59:26.920]  Number 5.
[01:59:26.920 --> 01:59:31.062]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[01:59:31.062 --> 01:59:36.104]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[01:59:36.104 --> 01:59:40.285]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:40.285 --> 01:59:42.066]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[01:59:42.066 --> 01:59:46.668]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[01:59:48.169 --> 01:59:55.996]  Waging war on corruption.
[01:59:55.996 --> 02:00:05.624]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[02:00:05.624 --> 02:00:06.925]  Big Brother.
[02:00:06.925 --> 02:00:07.906]  Mainstream media.
[02:00:08.684 --> 02:00:10.446]  Government cover-ups.
[02:00:10.446 --> 02:00:12.047]  You want answers?
[02:00:12.047 --> 02:00:13.568]  Well, so does he.
[02:00:13.568 --> 02:00:17.771]  He's Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[02:00:17.771 --> 02:00:21.835]  And now, live from Austin, Texas, Alex Jones.
[02:00:26.670 --> 02:00:31.856]  All right, ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the waypoint into this syndicated transmission.
[02:00:31.856 --> 02:00:35.440]  Going out on the AM and FM dial, gaining three or four new affiliates a week.
[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:38.564]  I want to thank all those fine valiant stations.
[02:00:38.564 --> 02:00:41.527]  Please, listeners, be sure and support local sponsors in your area.
[02:00:42.168 --> 02:00:45.890]  Or if you're a local listener who has a business, sponsor the broadcast.
[02:00:45.890 --> 02:00:48.451]  It's another great way to get the truth out there.
[02:00:48.451 --> 02:00:54.234]  And we're also on WWCR, Global Shortwave, XM Satellite re-airs this at night.
[02:00:54.234 --> 02:00:56.615]  And of course, InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com.
[02:00:56.615 --> 02:01:00.057]  You can listen to the audio streams or subscribe to the free podcast.
[02:01:00.057 --> 02:01:02.778]  We're also simulcasting at PrisonPlanet.tv.
[02:01:02.778 --> 02:01:09.501]  For PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, you can watch the Slash Radio Show via the video system.
[02:01:09.501 --> 02:01:10.442]  Not just a simple
[02:01:11.122 --> 02:01:19.926]  video cam but a full four camera shoot with the document cam exclusive videos we play and a lot more at PrisonPlanet.TV.
[02:01:19.926 --> 02:01:29.250]  Okay, I'm gonna try to get through a bunch of these calls and then go back into all the news that we have here today and it's very important but so are your calls.
[02:01:29.250 --> 02:01:32.231]  Scott in California says that he disagrees.
[02:01:32.231 --> 02:01:33.592]  So Scott, you go to the head of the line.
[02:01:33.592 --> 02:01:33.892]  Go ahead.
[02:01:35.532 --> 02:01:37.294]  Hey, man.
[02:01:37.294 --> 02:01:43.619]  I called because I wanted to give you grief, actually, about what I consider you to be dropping the ball.
[02:01:43.619 --> 02:02:01.635]  And that is, you know, we've been hearing hours and hours of broadcast about image protection with this MSNBC special, but with all of the InfoWars infrastructure and you being in close proximity, you have not covered what is unfolding to be one of the biggest stories of our lifetime in the Gulf.
[02:02:02.321 --> 02:02:09.706]  And you could be down there doing so much justice, and here we are just hearing total image, you know, protection.
[02:02:09.706 --> 02:02:12.567]  And it's getting, you know, I'm wondering, what are you doing?
[02:02:12.567 --> 02:02:15.189]  Why are you diverting from this enormous story?
[02:02:16.769 --> 02:02:21.594]  Well, Scott, I mean, we've had a lot of guests on, people from Louisiana on.
[02:02:21.594 --> 02:02:29.962]  I've gotten hundreds of emails saying, why aren't I reporting that 40 million people are being evacuated and there's gun confiscation going on, because it's not true.
[02:02:29.962 --> 02:02:32.704]  I mean, is that what you're talking about?
[02:02:32.704 --> 02:02:39.211]  Well, what I'm talking about is, Alex, with your infrastructure... Hold on a minute, put him on hold.
[02:02:39.211 --> 02:02:40.152]  My infrastructure...
[02:02:41.377 --> 02:02:45.200]  I mean, I'm here just trying to keep the websites up under the traffic they're getting.
[02:02:45.200 --> 02:02:46.361]  I'm here trying to pay the bills.
[02:02:46.361 --> 02:02:48.383]  I'm not that big.
[02:02:48.383 --> 02:02:56.789]  I've got about 20 employees and contractors, and I spend most of my time trying to raise the money just to run the infrastructure.
[02:02:56.789 --> 02:02:58.531]  You say one of the biggest stories ever.
[02:03:00.080 --> 02:03:04.003]  I mean, we know that they're telling the media don't be on the beach.
[02:03:04.003 --> 02:03:12.509]  I just sent two guys for four or five days to Chicago where they're having the army work with local police in door-to-door drills.
[02:03:12.509 --> 02:03:13.289]  That was in the...
[02:03:14.178 --> 02:03:15.338]  I don't think so.
[02:03:34.670 --> 02:03:35.211]  Well, you know what?
[02:03:35.211 --> 02:03:47.107]  I'd love to go to the Gulf and be down there by the beach and be able to have the wanderlust satisfied and look at a bunch of oil and some dead dolphins and have some guys run up and say, get off the beach and, you know, upload it to YouTube and get a million views.
[02:03:48.343 --> 02:03:50.944]  I think it's a diversion.
[02:03:50.944 --> 02:03:52.485]  It's a horrible thing that's happening, Scott.
[02:03:52.485 --> 02:03:54.266]  I'm going to go back to you so you don't hang up.
[02:03:54.266 --> 02:03:58.168]  I think it's a horrible thing that's happening down there, but compared to the U.N.
[02:03:58.168 --> 02:04:13.476]  about to vote, the Congress about to vote for an embargo and to board Iranian ships that leave their country, saying they're not allowed to have any trade, that's an act of war, and Israel's saying they're getting ready for World War III and to launch nukes, you know, that's in the Times of London Associated Press.
[02:04:14.853 --> 02:04:27.923]  Nuclear war is a lot bigger than 50 million barrels, or whatever it is, or 50 million gallons, excuse me, not 50 million barrels, well that'd be worse, 50 million gallons of oil in the Gulf.
[02:04:27.923 --> 02:04:31.546]  So, number one, I mean, I don't like to be praised.
[02:04:31.546 --> 02:04:34.828]  And we're gonna go to break, come back to you, Scott.
[02:04:34.828 --> 02:04:41.534]  I don't like people calling and telling me what a great job I'm doing, because I'm doing my duty, and I am actually self-critical, and I'm always trying to do a better job.
[02:04:42.830 --> 02:04:47.013]  But conversely, I don't like being criticized about what I need to do.
[02:04:47.013 --> 02:04:52.017]  You know, I cover the oil spill probably an hour or more a day, total.
[02:04:52.017 --> 02:04:52.737]  Today, even more.
[02:04:52.737 --> 02:04:57.901]  We got a full hour just of Pastor Lindsey Williams talking about it.
[02:04:57.901 --> 02:04:59.302]  We're taking your phone calls.
[02:04:59.302 --> 02:05:00.043]  And then I'm bad?
[02:05:00.043 --> 02:05:04.586]  Hi folks, this is Alex Jones asking you for a minute of your time to tell you about soap.
[02:05:04.586 --> 02:05:10.591]  Not detergents, but good old-fashioned pure soap made by the Cal Bend Soap Company, a family-owned and operated American company.
[02:05:10.971 --> 02:05:18.354]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[02:05:18.354 --> 02:05:23.236]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.
[02:05:23.236 --> 02:05:31.899]  Get a free, detailed catalog by calling 800-340-7091 or see them online at 5starsoap.com or infowars.com.
[02:05:31.899 --> 02:05:35.621]  Let's talk to the owner of 5 Star Soap, Marty Schachter, and see what he has to say.
[02:05:36.161 --> 02:05:42.926]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[02:05:42.926 --> 02:05:46.809]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.
[02:05:46.809 --> 02:05:59.158]  Call us at 1-800-340-7091 or visit our website 5starsoap.com for buying our 1 to 2 month soap sampler.
[02:05:59.158 --> 02:05:59.518]  Thank you.
[02:06:04.324 --> 02:06:05.565]  Tyranny is here.
[02:06:05.565 --> 02:06:09.449]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[02:06:09.449 --> 02:06:11.751]  It really says that the state is God.
[02:06:11.751 --> 02:06:17.616]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[02:06:17.616 --> 02:06:23.862]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[02:06:24.262 --> 02:06:30.226]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[02:06:30.226 --> 02:06:34.429]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depths to which our republic has fallen.
[02:06:34.429 --> 02:06:38.712]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[02:06:38.712 --> 02:06:44.657]  Body scanners, sound cameras, citizen spies, stage terror and cameras on every street corner.
[02:06:44.657 --> 02:06:48.219]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[02:06:48.219 --> 02:06:50.200]  The police state isn't coming.
[02:06:50.200 --> 02:06:50.641]  It's here.

[02:08:02.600 --> 02:08:09.243]  From his Central Texas Command Center, deep behind enemy lines, the information war continues.
[02:08:09.243 --> 02:08:15.405]  It's Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[02:08:15.405 --> 02:08:23.769]  Okay, if you just joined us, Scott in California called in and said, you're not covering the oil spill, the biggest story ever.
[02:08:25.307 --> 02:08:28.869]  Which I resent, that's not true, we've been covering it.
[02:08:28.869 --> 02:08:31.851]  And all you're doing is image control.
[02:08:31.851 --> 02:08:36.454]  No, I mean we probably spent 30 minutes yesterday on the Chris Matthews thing, probably 5 minutes today.
[02:08:38.007 --> 02:08:38.487]  I don't know.
[02:08:59.580 --> 02:08:59.800]  I don't
[02:09:16.216 --> 02:09:19.718]  The situation with Iran is much more important.
[02:09:19.718 --> 02:09:34.625]  Scott, did you hear me earlier read that the Iranians, we have an InfoWars.com article Curt Nemo wrote, linking to the Iranian government's announcements on press TV, that if the UN goes ahead with its fourth round of sanctions, which includes a blockade,
[02:09:35.765 --> 02:09:43.128]  Of Iranian ships coming and going, that that's an act of war, that they're going to start boarding other people's vessels.
[02:09:43.128 --> 02:09:45.509]  I mean, really, I think that's the biggest issue.
[02:09:45.509 --> 02:09:57.854]  Secondarily, I think the world economic implosion going on with the central banks looting us and then foisting this unpayable debt on our backs is big.
[02:09:57.854 --> 02:10:01.095]  I happen to know there have been bigger oil spills in the Middle East.
[02:10:01.895 --> 02:10:01.955]  Yes.
[02:10:19.761 --> 02:10:23.444]  Uh, CEO dumping 33 or more percent of their stock.
[02:10:23.444 --> 02:10:27.266]  You've got Goldman Sachs being the co-chair of BP when this happened.
[02:10:27.266 --> 02:10:38.914]  You've got them dumping 44% and then more in a second sale the day of, but in the month before and up to two days before, dumping 44% a record amount just on that oil company.
[02:10:38.914 --> 02:10:44.398]  You have BP being a top globalist company that's invested tens of billions of dollars in global carbon taxes.
[02:10:45.609 --> 02:10:52.814]  You have Obama blocking the local communities from protecting their estuaries in the two weeks they had to get the systems up.
[02:10:52.814 --> 02:10:59.138]  Blocking the Dutch and the Norwegians and others with their big mega-skimmers that they had in the area that could have really mitigated things.
[02:10:59.138 --> 02:11:01.380]  Stopping an immediate burn-off at the site.
[02:11:01.380 --> 02:11:02.720]  They're now igniting a flare.
[02:11:02.720 --> 02:11:04.402]  They think it'll burn about 10% of it.
[02:11:04.402 --> 02:11:05.782]  They've got another mitigation.
[02:11:05.782 --> 02:11:07.243]  They think it's about 30% of it.
[02:11:07.243 --> 02:11:09.085]  So that cuts it by 40%.
[02:11:09.085 --> 02:11:11.887]  They should have immediately torched it and lit the thing on fire.
[02:11:11.887 --> 02:11:15.249]  Then you would have just had the carbon dioxide off-gassing.
[02:11:16.950 --> 02:11:24.295]  But, and I'm not an oil expert, I just go to what the experts have always done and did immediate research on those subjects.
[02:11:24.295 --> 02:11:25.636]  So what else am I supposed to do?
[02:11:25.636 --> 02:11:33.321]  I mean, coming up in T-minus 49 minutes, we got Lindsey Williams on, you know, going over this more.
[02:11:33.321 --> 02:11:37.724]  I just think with everything going on in the world, you know, I'm not the bad guy here, Scott.
[02:11:37.724 --> 02:11:38.925]  I mean, what do I do?
[02:11:38.925 --> 02:11:43.128]  Send two guys to the coast or not do my radio show?
[02:11:44.068 --> 02:11:57.596]  And walk away from something that reaches millions of people, and go to the coast and show a dead dolphin, and have some BP guys walk up and say, get out of here, get off my coastline, and go file a complaint that my rights are being violated.
[02:11:59.071 --> 02:12:06.740]  Scott, tell me how to do it, because I do need advice, but I don't think I should be criticized because I can't do everything.
[02:12:06.740 --> 02:12:13.067]  Sir, tonight my son calls me every day at about 4 or 5 and says, Daddy, are you coming home?
[02:12:13.067 --> 02:12:14.429]  And I tell him no.
[02:12:15.410 --> 02:12:21.515]  And last night, Daddy didn't come home until about 10, and tonight, Daddy isn't coming home until maybe midnight.
[02:12:21.515 --> 02:12:22.856]  I'm working on a film.
[02:12:22.856 --> 02:12:39.169]  I mean, I don't know how I run websites, make business decisions on what to fund, what not to fund, deal with employee issues, deal with my own household, my children, deal with making films, doing a radio show four hours a day, turn down all these magazine, newspaper, and radio interviews.
[02:12:39.169 --> 02:12:44.273]  I mean, explain to me, Scott, how I can do more for you.
[02:12:45.993 --> 02:12:50.616]  Well, actually, it's not more for me and less dialogue.
[02:12:50.616 --> 02:12:54.057]  You'll get information that it doesn't even pan out.
[02:12:54.057 --> 02:12:57.539]  You'll run up to Hardin, Montana in 24-hour notice.
[02:12:57.539 --> 02:13:03.683]  You'll report that FEMA's using outhouses to beat people because somebody told you.
[02:13:03.683 --> 02:13:04.603]  But this is a huge story.
[02:13:04.603 --> 02:13:05.524]  Hold on a minute.
[02:13:05.524 --> 02:13:08.826]  I never said FEMA's using outhouses to beat people.
[02:13:08.826 --> 02:13:11.087]  Making a little joke like you would.
[02:13:11.087 --> 02:13:14.789]  But my point is, just like the whole post office thing, that's what I'm talking about.
[02:13:15.370 --> 02:13:17.771]  Anyhow, the point is this, yesterday...
[02:13:34.958 --> 02:13:46.551]  There is a program to use the post offices as emergency forced inoculation centers as part of the Model Health Emergency Powers Act.
[02:13:46.551 --> 02:13:48.873]  Let me go over each thing you're saying here because this isn't true.
[02:13:49.875 --> 02:14:03.418]  There is a program to use these post offices and with the Hardin, Montana situation, the same companies now in Texas, we had an article about this two weeks ago, trying to get other municipalities to build more private prisons.
[02:14:03.418 --> 02:14:06.459]  That guy was a felon up there running that.
[02:14:06.459 --> 02:14:10.220]  There were blueprints that said alien detention center.
[02:14:10.220 --> 02:14:11.380]  They did want to use it.
[02:14:11.920 --> 02:14:15.421]  That was on CNN to hold people from Camp X-Ray.
[02:14:15.421 --> 02:14:23.023]  They did have police on the side of their vehicles, and so I went and checked into that because we didn't know!
[02:14:23.023 --> 02:14:26.945]  And I wanted to be there to see exactly what was happening.
[02:14:26.945 --> 02:14:28.985]  We know what's going on in the Gulf.
[02:14:28.985 --> 02:14:34.927]  We've had reporters on that we trust, radio talk show hosts, and others that live down there.
[02:14:34.927 --> 02:14:37.748]  We know what's going on in the Gulf.
[02:14:37.748 --> 02:14:39.028]  Okay?
[02:14:39.028 --> 02:14:39.869]  So, I mean,
[02:14:41.431 --> 02:14:44.274]  That doesn't make sense.
[02:14:44.274 --> 02:14:45.075]  Am I on?
[02:14:45.075 --> 02:14:45.996]  Yeah, you're on, Scott.
[02:14:45.996 --> 02:14:47.638]  Okay, excellent.
[02:14:47.638 --> 02:14:52.704]  Alex, seriously, this is everybody from the esoteric to the scientific.
[02:14:53.231 --> 02:14:56.232]  ...are talking about the global implications of this.
[02:14:56.232 --> 02:15:01.073]  You do have the ability to... Yeah, the media is hyping the living... put him on hold again.
[02:15:01.073 --> 02:15:07.894]  I'm not going to get up here, people with two weeks been telling me, say they're evacuating 40 million people, say there's martial law.
[02:15:07.894 --> 02:15:10.674]  The whole country's under a form of martial law.
[02:15:10.674 --> 02:15:12.795]  I'm just not going to report that.
[02:15:12.795 --> 02:15:13.895]  Okay?
[02:15:13.895 --> 02:15:15.495]  And you say the esoteric.
[02:15:15.495 --> 02:15:16.075]  Okay.
[02:15:16.075 --> 02:15:17.796]  Let me read... I mean, let's do what you want here.
[02:15:17.796 --> 02:15:18.436]  Wormwood.
[02:15:20.045 --> 02:15:46.466]  is the Greek is a star or angel that appears in the biblical New Testament book of Revelation and Wormwood falls into the ocean and it's mentioned in Deuteronomy, Jeremiah and a bunch of other places interpretations of Revelation 8-10 here and of course no one in six months will say that okay you were right it wasn't the end of the world and it didn't kill a third of the entire ocean on the world
[02:15:48.217 --> 02:15:51.518]  Okay, no one, it'll just be Alex is bad, he's covering up Wormwood.
[02:15:51.518 --> 02:16:06.385]  So here, okay, it's the end of the world, and Wormwood, a star fell, and hit the oil platform, and it's just, and let's have some Nostradamus, some vague Nostradamus here for you.
[02:16:06.385 --> 02:16:08.706]  Let's go ahead and read over this for people.
[02:16:08.706 --> 02:16:12.988]  Here, let's get into this for people.
[02:16:12.988 --> 02:16:15.509]  Futurist interpretations, and then it gets into
[02:16:16.926 --> 02:16:20.268]  The Oil Spill and Wormwood.
[02:16:20.268 --> 02:16:22.769]  This from the Christian-Forum.net.
[02:16:22.769 --> 02:16:27.272]  It says, in the last days, or should we look, worse things to happen.
[02:16:27.272 --> 02:16:34.116]  Revelation 8, 5, the angel took the canister and filled it with fire of the altar and casted it into the earth.
[02:16:34.116 --> 02:16:37.458]  And there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake.
[02:16:37.458 --> 02:16:41.661]  Six and seven angels, which had these seven trumpets, prepared themselves to sound.
[02:16:41.661 --> 02:16:45.143]  And people say, look, there were earthquakes in Haiti and Chile.
[02:16:46.562 --> 02:16:51.766]  So, there's always earthquakes.
[02:16:51.766 --> 02:16:54.408]  I mean, I just go off what I can prove here, okay?
[02:16:54.408 --> 02:17:00.452]  The first angel sounded and there were followed a hail and fire mingled with blood.
[02:17:00.452 --> 02:17:02.674]  So hail and fire is falling.
[02:17:02.674 --> 02:17:03.254]  And blood.
[02:17:03.254 --> 02:17:04.415]  Sounds like nuclear war to me.
[02:17:04.415 --> 02:17:06.256]  Doesn't sound like an oil rig.
[02:17:06.256 --> 02:17:10.459]  The first angel... Now, if they attack Iran, this may end up happening.
[02:17:10.459 --> 02:17:11.740]  But I'm not supposed to talk about that.
[02:17:11.740 --> 02:17:14.122]  I'm supposed to... The esoteric says, Alex,
[02:17:15.168 --> 02:17:24.600]  The first angel sounded, and there were hail and fire mingled with blood, and they were cast upon the earth, and the third part of trees was burnt up.
[02:17:24.600 --> 02:17:27.623]  A third part of the earth's trees were burnt up?
[02:17:27.623 --> 02:17:29.185]  Has that happened?
[02:17:29.185 --> 02:17:30.687]  And all green grass was burnt up.
[02:17:31.784 --> 02:17:37.725]  And the second angel sounded, and it was with a great mountain burning, and fire was cast into the sea.
[02:17:37.725 --> 02:17:39.806]  So they say, oh, look at Iceland.
[02:17:39.806 --> 02:17:40.726]  That just happened.
[02:17:40.726 --> 02:17:42.526]  And the third part of the sea became blood.
[02:17:42.526 --> 02:17:48.868]  And the third part of the creatures that were in the sea and had life died, and the third part of the ships were destroyed.
[02:17:48.868 --> 02:17:51.849]  A third of the animals aren't dead, a third of the ships aren't destroyed.
[02:17:51.849 --> 02:17:57.310]  Verse 10, and the third angel sounded, and there fell a great star from heaven burning as it were a lamp.
[02:17:58.248 --> 02:17:59.448]  An asteroid, folks.
[02:17:59.448 --> 02:18:04.329]  And it fell upon the third part of the rivers, and upon the fountains of waters, in 11.
[02:18:04.329 --> 02:18:06.550]  And the name of the star is called Wormwood.
[02:18:06.550 --> 02:18:09.430]  And the third part of the waters came Wormwood.
[02:18:09.430 --> 02:18:12.631]  And many men died of the waters, because they were bitter.
[02:18:12.631 --> 02:18:14.651]  And the fourth angel sounded.
[02:18:14.651 --> 02:18:17.092]  Now, what kind of star can fall?
[02:18:17.092 --> 02:18:18.672]  A hydrogen bomb?
[02:18:18.672 --> 02:18:20.893]  Nuclear radiation fallout?
[02:18:20.893 --> 02:18:21.833]  Contaminating the water?
[02:18:24.039 --> 02:18:35.404]  And the fourth angel sounded, and the third part of the sun was smitten, the third part of the moon, the third part of the stars, so the third part of them was darkened, and the day shone not for part of it, and the night likewise.
[02:18:35.404 --> 02:18:49.651]  Thirteen, and I beheld and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven, saying with a loud voice, Woe, woe, woe, like you're in deep trouble, buddy, to the inhabitants of the earth, by reason of other voices of the trumpet and the three angels, which are yet to sound.
[02:18:52.259 --> 02:18:56.964]  I mean, this is not the end of the world with this oil leaking, okay?
[02:18:56.964 --> 02:18:58.886]  What is it you don't understand?
[02:18:58.886 --> 02:19:03.270]  There have been bigger oil leaks in the ocean before.
[02:19:03.270 --> 02:19:08.315]  It is not good, but they are not evacuating 40 million people.
[02:19:08.315 --> 02:19:09.336]  That is not happening.
[02:19:10.709 --> 02:19:11.570]  Okay?
[02:19:11.570 --> 02:19:13.152]  That is not going on.
[02:19:13.152 --> 02:19:14.513]  That is not happening.
[02:19:14.513 --> 02:19:16.375]  We're not covering that up.
[02:19:16.375 --> 02:19:18.437]  Wormwood has not fallen.
[02:19:18.437 --> 02:19:23.242]  A third of the Earth's men are not dying right now of poison.
[02:19:23.242 --> 02:19:26.745]  A third of the trees and all the grass is not burned up.
[02:19:26.745 --> 02:19:28.607]  A third of the ships are not destroyed.
[02:19:28.607 --> 02:19:31.310]  A third of the life in the ocean is not dead.
[02:19:34.144 --> 02:19:37.826]  The media is hyping this as a diversion, just like after 9-11.
[02:19:37.826 --> 02:19:40.207]  That's all that was on the news for four or five months.
[02:19:40.207 --> 02:19:41.968]  That's all anybody would talk about.
[02:19:41.968 --> 02:19:45.330]  While they were busy taking over.
[02:19:45.330 --> 02:19:45.950]  Stay there, Scott.
[02:19:45.950 --> 02:19:49.032]  I'm going to have you continue here, and I'm not going to spend much more time with you, though.
[02:19:49.032 --> 02:19:49.312]  Okay?
[02:19:49.312 --> 02:19:52.494]  You mean you're on the air, and all you're doing is complaining about me?
[02:19:52.494 --> 02:19:54.395]  Tell us the big revelation!
[02:19:54.395 --> 02:19:58.417]  Tell us about what it is we must know about the stupid BP Oil League!
[02:20:01.121 --> 02:20:05.664]  This is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:20:05.664 --> 02:20:06.584]  Number one.
[02:20:06.584 --> 02:20:10.006]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:20:10.006 --> 02:20:10.866]  Number two.
[02:20:10.866 --> 02:20:15.749]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:20:15.749 --> 02:20:16.509]  It's true.
[02:20:16.509 --> 02:20:21.052]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:20:21.372 --> 02:20:22.193]  Number 3.
[02:20:22.193 --> 02:20:25.775]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:20:25.775 --> 02:20:29.698]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:20:29.698 --> 02:20:30.499]  Number 4.
[02:20:30.499 --> 02:20:33.260]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:20:33.260 --> 02:20:36.603]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:20:36.923 --> 02:20:41.864]  Number five, a solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:20:41.864 --> 02:20:46.906]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:20:46.906 --> 02:20:51.087]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:51.087 --> 02:20:52.867]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:20:52.867 --> 02:20:57.488]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-877-327-0365.
[02:21:01.257 --> 02:21:03.559]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[02:21:03.559 --> 02:21:03.839]  June 17, 2010.
[02:21:03.839 --> 02:21:04.940]  Gold opened this morning at $1238.40.
[02:21:04.940 --> 02:21:07.983]  A one ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1271.33, $635.66 for a half ounce, or $317.83 for the quarter ounce.
[02:21:07.983 --> 02:21:08.443]  That's $1271.33, $635.66, or $317.83.
[02:21:20.908 --> 02:21:23.771]  Making the right decision is a challenge to investors.
[02:21:23.771 --> 02:21:28.054]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or worse, depression?
[02:21:28.054 --> 02:21:32.939]  Many investors are turning to gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[02:21:32.939 --> 02:21:36.362]  Midas has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold.
[02:21:36.702 --> 02:21:39.343]  Discussing costs, benefits, risks.

[02:21:44.464 --> 02:21:47.924]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000 year history.

[02:21:53.806 --> 02:21:54.046]  Call 800-686-2237.
[02:22:01.650 --> 02:22:06.633]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[02:22:06.633 --> 02:22:07.613]  What have we got?
[02:22:07.613 --> 02:22:10.074]  A republic or a monarchy?
[02:22:10.074 --> 02:22:11.075]  A republic.
[02:22:11.075 --> 02:22:13.716]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[02:22:13.716 --> 02:22:15.977]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[02:22:15.977 --> 02:22:18.018]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[02:22:18.018 --> 02:22:19.699]  So they think they own our land?
[02:22:19.699 --> 02:22:21.020]  They think they own our water?
[02:22:21.020 --> 02:22:21.620]  Children?
[02:22:21.620 --> 02:22:22.741]  Our education?
[02:22:22.741 --> 02:22:23.561]  Our money?
[02:22:23.561 --> 02:22:27.203]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[02:22:27.586 --> 02:22:31.270]  Somebody's going to ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[02:22:31.270 --> 02:22:32.551]  You're being warned.
[02:22:32.551 --> 02:22:33.592]  We have the facts.
[02:22:33.592 --> 02:22:34.753]  We have the Constitution.
[02:22:34.753 --> 02:22:35.654]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[02:22:35.654 --> 02:22:36.535]  We have common law.
[02:22:36.535 --> 02:22:39.057]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:22:39.057 --> 02:22:42.020]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me.
[02:22:42.020 --> 02:22:42.961]  Rise of the Republic.
[02:22:42.961 --> 02:22:47.905]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[02:22:47.905 --> 02:22:49.427]  A new tool in the Info War.
[02:22:49.427 --> 02:22:50.488]  Don't Tread on Me.
[02:22:50.488 --> 02:22:51.769]  Order it at InfoWars.com.
[02:22:53.050 --> 02:22:56.896]  Or prisonplanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[02:23:01.877 --> 02:23:04.879]  You've seen our Sinofresh banner on the GCN website.
[02:23:04.879 --> 02:23:06.940]  Yet your sinusitis is still a problem.
[02:23:06.940 --> 02:23:09.682]  Are you waiting for your sinusitis to go away by itself?
[02:23:09.682 --> 02:23:11.924]  Are you waiting for a Sinofresh discount?
[02:23:11.924 --> 02:23:13.325]  Okay, here it comes.
[02:23:13.325 --> 02:23:15.226]  But first, the facts.
[02:23:15.226 --> 02:23:17.167]  67 other products merely treat symptoms.
[02:23:17.167 --> 02:23:19.149]  And not the cause of sinus problems.
[02:23:19.149 --> 02:23:22.831]  And 37 million Americans suffer from sinus distress just like you.
[02:23:22.831 --> 02:23:30.596]  But now many are finding relief with the only patent-protected homeopathic nasal product that antiseptically eliminates the known causes of sinusitis.
[02:23:30.596 --> 02:23:31.197]  Sinofresh.
[02:23:31.457 --> 02:23:34.518]  Now, here's your limited time discount offer to use Sinofresh.

[02:23:40.339 --> 02:23:40.939]  That's it!

[02:23:46.240 --> 02:23:49.241]  But hurry, this offer is only for the first 1,000 customers.

[02:23:49.641 --> 02:23:50.821]  Call right now for $2 off per bottle.
[02:23:50.821 --> 02:23:51.181]  Mention GCN.
[02:23:51.181 --> 02:23:52.121]  Buy Sinofresh.com.
[02:23:52.121 --> 02:23:52.381]  It worked!
[02:24:06.570 --> 02:24:09.052]  Alright, let me finish up with Scott and have him make his point.
[02:24:09.052 --> 02:24:14.216]  Then I've got to move on to David, Truthmaster, Mark, Kyle, and others that have got their points to make.
[02:24:14.216 --> 02:24:19.219]  And I've got a bunch of news to get to before Lindsey Williams comes on to talk about the oil spill.
[02:24:19.219 --> 02:24:20.920]  Okay, Scott, go ahead.
[02:24:20.920 --> 02:24:24.023]  Hey, man.
[02:24:24.023 --> 02:24:25.203]  I said the wide spectrum.
[02:24:25.203 --> 02:24:26.504]  I didn't just say the esoteric.
[02:24:26.504 --> 02:24:28.486]  I said the esoteric to the scientific.
[02:24:28.486 --> 02:24:31.328]  But let me go further with this.
[02:24:31.328 --> 02:24:35.511]  You've got people like Richard Hoagland who's talking about the enormous gas bubble that they're seeing.
[02:24:36.212 --> 02:24:43.073]  You got questions about the czars, questions about the Corexit, all the dispersants that they're throwing down.
[02:24:43.073 --> 02:24:48.014]  There's so much about this story that only the alternative media has been telling.
[02:24:48.014 --> 02:24:54.035]  And you, who allegedly have the biggest footprint in the alternative media, have been talking about Chris Matthews.
[02:24:54.035 --> 02:24:58.576]  Nobody a year from now is going to be worried about that MSNBC piece that was done.
[02:24:58.576 --> 02:25:03.117]  But when all those people, all your listeners down in the South, are going to be wondering, where was Alex Jones?
[02:25:03.573 --> 02:25:06.414]  An American reporter, where was he?
[02:25:06.414 --> 02:25:12.276]  Why was he talking about other things and diverting away from a story about something that's decimated us?
[02:25:12.276 --> 02:25:13.856]  Well, Scott, this is a hoax.
[02:25:13.856 --> 02:25:17.597]  I mean, you ought to go work for MSNBC yourself.
[02:25:17.597 --> 02:25:19.498]  It's a hoax.
[02:25:19.498 --> 02:25:28.781]  And they're going to wonder where was Alex on the Gulf oil spill, talking about it probably more than I should have.
[02:25:30.217 --> 02:25:32.799]  We've been talking about it for 25 minutes with you.
[02:25:32.799 --> 02:25:34.981]  I was talking about it in the first hour.
[02:25:34.981 --> 02:25:36.862]  I was talking about it in the last hour.
[02:25:36.862 --> 02:25:39.924]  It's just, it's just, I shouldn't have spent so much time with Scott.
[02:25:39.924 --> 02:25:44.367]  It's just when you talk to somebody who doesn't hear anything you say.
[02:25:44.367 --> 02:25:46.329]  I just talked about dispersants.
[02:25:46.329 --> 02:25:49.271]  I'm talking to Lindsey Williams about it next hour.
[02:25:49.271 --> 02:25:50.792]  That was just bizarre.
[02:25:50.792 --> 02:25:51.913]  Just bizarre.
[02:25:54.076 --> 02:25:55.537]  Very strange.
[02:25:55.537 --> 02:25:57.417]  Very, very strange.
[02:25:57.417 --> 02:25:58.978]  David in South Carolina.
[02:25:58.978 --> 02:26:00.118]  Sorry to have you hold that long.
[02:26:00.118 --> 02:26:02.880]  Go ahead.
[02:26:02.880 --> 02:26:03.920]  Are you there, Alex?
[02:26:03.920 --> 02:26:04.340]  Yes, sir.
[02:26:04.340 --> 02:26:06.221]  Go ahead and turn that radio off.
[02:26:06.221 --> 02:26:07.441]  Oh, it's a computer.
[02:26:07.441 --> 02:26:08.562]  That's how I listen to you.
[02:26:08.562 --> 02:26:11.183]  No, no, I understand, but I can hear the last caller.
[02:26:11.183 --> 02:26:11.643]  I can hear him.
[02:26:11.643 --> 02:26:17.505]  My question's not about the Gulf or Iran.
[02:26:17.505 --> 02:26:23.708]  My question is about Obama instructed our UN ambassador to vote on global
[02:26:24.409 --> 02:26:26.852]  Gun Control Treaty.
[02:26:26.852 --> 02:26:31.197]  And that goes to show you right here, Alex, while Obama got planned...
[02:26:32.157 --> 02:26:36.362]  I will say, he already had defaced our Constitution.
[02:26:36.362 --> 02:26:37.162]  Hold on, David.
[02:26:37.162 --> 02:26:40.286]  According to Scott, I need to hang up on you right now.
[02:26:40.286 --> 02:26:51.437]  We can't talk about Obama supporting a global gun ban treaty with the UN, which does directly threaten our Second Amendment, or our Attorney General who says we have no right to own guns.
[02:26:51.437 --> 02:26:54.040]  David, you only can talk about the Gulf.
[02:26:55.191 --> 02:26:56.252]  I'm sorry.
[02:26:56.252 --> 02:26:56.972]  I'm sorry, David.
[02:26:56.972 --> 02:26:57.713]  I gotta let you go.
[02:26:57.713 --> 02:27:00.034]  Okay?
[02:27:00.034 --> 02:27:01.575]  Where was David?
[02:27:01.575 --> 02:27:05.438]  Where was Alex when the UN was passing a treaty to ban our guns?
[02:27:05.438 --> 02:27:07.299]  Well, we were talking about the oil spill.
[02:27:07.299 --> 02:27:08.560]  Sorry, David!
[02:27:08.560 --> 02:27:09.741]  No, no, I appreciate your call, David.
[02:27:09.741 --> 02:27:10.401]  That is important.
[02:27:10.401 --> 02:27:11.822]  We have talked about it.
[02:27:11.822 --> 02:27:13.384]  Let's get Larry Pratt on next week.
[02:27:13.384 --> 02:27:18.967]  I know that'll make Scott mad, but let's get Larry Pratt on next week for about 30 minutes about the UN treaty.
[02:27:18.967 --> 02:27:20.328]  That's very serious.
[02:27:20.328 --> 02:27:22.310]  It also shows us the intent of the White House.
[02:27:23.212 --> 02:27:25.182]  Truth Master, you're on the air.
[02:27:25.182 --> 02:27:26.550]  Better be about the oil spill.
[02:27:26.550 --> 02:27:26.952]  Go ahead.
[02:27:28.308 --> 02:27:32.931]  Okay, well, first of all, this oil spill nonsense is exactly what that is.
[02:27:32.931 --> 02:27:34.512]  It's nonsense.
[02:27:34.512 --> 02:27:39.775]  I can tell you that back in the 70s, I think it was 72, the exact same thing happened.
[02:27:39.775 --> 02:27:43.197]  They tried the exact same procedures.
[02:27:43.197 --> 02:27:44.398]  They didn't call it Top Hat.
[02:27:44.398 --> 02:27:46.559]  They called it Operation Sombrero.
[02:27:46.559 --> 02:27:47.699]  They tried the top fill.
[02:27:47.699 --> 02:27:48.940]  They tried all of that stuff.
[02:27:48.940 --> 02:27:54.483]  The only thing that worked was drilling, and it gushed uncontrollably for 90 days.
[02:27:54.483 --> 02:27:56.885]  Exact same thing happened right there in the Gulf.
[02:27:57.325 --> 02:28:01.446]  Everybody forgot about that, but the media made a huge deal about it back then as well.
[02:28:01.446 --> 02:28:02.347]  It's just a distraction.
[02:28:02.347 --> 02:28:12.770]  Because they know something that's like a ticking clock that's day-to-day is a soap opera just like Chandra Levy before the globalists carried out 9-11 and here they are
[02:28:12.950 --> 02:28:13.370]  We're good to go.
[02:28:34.881 --> 02:28:36.723]  I said they're gearing up for flu hype.
[02:28:36.723 --> 02:28:41.428]  I don't know if it's going to be real or if it's going to be staged, but they're getting ready for martial law.
[02:28:41.428 --> 02:28:54.642]  And I had government documents, I had eyewitnesses, and then I got accused by the COINTELPRO of fear-mongering about the flu when I was the one saying it was a hoax.
[02:28:54.642 --> 02:28:56.424]  Now, that's mind control, isn't it?
[02:28:57.463 --> 02:28:57.904]  It is.
[02:28:57.904 --> 02:29:03.930]  And see, the thing is that as a truth master, I go around and I wake up as many people as I can.
[02:29:03.930 --> 02:29:07.614]  Typically I get on average 20 to 30 people a year.
[02:29:07.614 --> 02:29:12.940]  Now, I can tell you that all of these people that are just roaming around, that have just got their heads buried in the sand,
[02:29:13.180 --> 02:29:14.141]  We're good to go.
[02:29:39.995 --> 02:29:41.396]  On the issue.
[02:29:41.396 --> 02:29:48.158]  I'd say you're spending too much time on it, and I had one other point I wanted to cover in regards to... Alright, stay there though, but it better be on the oil spill.
[02:29:48.158 --> 02:29:51.299]  We'll be right back.
[02:29:51.299 --> 02:29:52.700]  We're on the march.
[02:29:52.700 --> 02:29:55.221]  The Empire's on the run.
[02:29:55.221 --> 02:29:57.922]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.

[02:31:00.745 --> 02:31:03.769]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[02:31:03.769 --> 02:31:09.096]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[02:31:09.096 --> 02:31:11.139]  My answer would be all I can get.
[02:31:11.139 --> 02:31:16.145]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[02:31:16.145 --> 02:31:17.347]  How much do you want?
[02:31:17.347 --> 02:31:18.068]  When do you want it?
[02:31:18.448 --> 02:31:20.330]  Now or after the battle starts?
[02:31:20.330 --> 02:31:21.391]  When will you need it?
[02:31:21.391 --> 02:31:23.613]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[02:31:23.613 --> 02:31:24.935]  Will there be any food?
[02:31:24.935 --> 02:31:26.476]  Will it make your children sick?
[02:31:26.476 --> 02:31:31.742]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[02:31:31.742 --> 02:31:34.885]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[02:31:35.305 --> 02:31:39.127]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[02:31:39.127 --> 02:31:40.368]  How much will you need?
[02:31:40.368 --> 02:31:41.268]  We don't know.
[02:31:41.268 --> 02:31:42.369]  How much do you want?
[02:31:42.369 --> 02:31:43.289]  All you can get.
[02:31:43.289 --> 02:31:44.390]  I'm Alex Jones.
[02:31:44.390 --> 02:31:47.451]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[02:31:47.451 --> 02:31:49.212]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[02:31:49.212 --> 02:31:50.132]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[02:31:59.670 --> 02:32:04.233]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[02:32:04.233 --> 02:32:05.133]  Number 1.
[02:32:05.133 --> 02:32:08.556]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[02:32:08.556 --> 02:32:09.436]  Number 2.
[02:32:09.436 --> 02:32:14.319]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[02:32:14.319 --> 02:32:15.060]  It's true.
[02:32:15.060 --> 02:32:19.923]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[02:32:19.923 --> 02:32:20.763]  Number 3.
[02:32:20.763 --> 02:32:24.346]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[02:32:24.346 --> 02:32:28.028]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[02:32:28.248 --> 02:32:29.048]  Number 4.
[02:32:29.048 --> 02:32:31.809]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[02:32:31.809 --> 02:32:35.490]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[02:32:35.490 --> 02:32:36.271]  Number 5.
[02:32:36.271 --> 02:32:40.412]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[02:32:40.412 --> 02:32:45.474]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[02:32:45.474 --> 02:32:49.655]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:49.655 --> 02:32:51.435]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[02:32:51.435 --> 02:32:56.037]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[02:32:56.537 --> 02:33:14.180]  Yep, coming to you from a little place called Texas!
[02:33:14.180 --> 02:33:18.621]  Thank you for joining us, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:33:18.621 --> 02:33:24.342]  Alright, look, I need to get into more of the news, and then we've got Lindsey Williams coming up to cover the oil spill, but
[02:33:26.940 --> 02:33:30.284]  It's like an oxymoron when somebody criticizes me for something that isn't real.
[02:33:30.284 --> 02:33:34.870]  It's like it gets stuck in my head and then I'll get hundreds of emails saying, why did you have that idiot on that long?
[02:33:34.870 --> 02:33:45.903]  It just really frustrates me because I cover what I think is important and that doesn't mean I'm always right, but I've been doing this longer than most people and I've got a pretty good record of being spot on.
[02:33:47.645 --> 02:33:49.046]  But it's my radio show!
[02:33:49.046 --> 02:33:51.107]  I mean, you know, I'm not bad.
[02:33:51.107 --> 02:33:54.129]  I'm not the one sending the IRS after you to take your property.
[02:33:54.129 --> 02:33:55.950]  I'm not the one launching the new wars.
[02:33:55.950 --> 02:34:02.594]  I'm not the offshore banks selling derivatives to our government and creating a debt black hole that's impossible to pay back.
[02:34:02.594 --> 02:34:07.918]  I'm simply somebody here trying to get people motivated to take action and be leaders in their own right.
[02:34:08.638 --> 02:34:14.020]  But so many times in history, the people that get smashed are the ones that stand up against the evil.
[02:34:14.020 --> 02:34:18.022]  You know, the crowd says, no, we don't like you for telling us about the problem.
[02:34:18.022 --> 02:34:20.043]  You didn't tell us about it right.
[02:34:20.043 --> 02:34:24.904]  Now, I want to get into Iran threatens to stop Western ships if subjected to cargo inspection.
[02:34:24.904 --> 02:34:25.885]  This is big news.
[02:34:27.489 --> 02:34:44.375]  I know the media isn't talking about it every five minutes and saying something must be done and, you know, oh and the media cares so much about the public and what's Obama gonna do and everyone feels like they've been wronged and gets all angry because the TV tells you so, but they don't tell you to get mad at the bankers.
[02:34:45.640 --> 02:34:53.025]  They don't tell you to get mad at the military-industrial complex that wants to pass laws to secretly arrest you and be able to torture you.
[02:34:53.025 --> 02:34:54.366]  No, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:34:54.366 --> 02:34:57.468]  All the big issues we're not supposed to be upset about.
[02:34:57.468 --> 02:35:01.912]  We're all whipped up into this big fury, which has much to do about nothing.
[02:35:01.912 --> 02:35:11.338]  And we've also got Bruno Breweiler, who I've talked to, been a guest on the show, gave us some great video that we've put in some of the documentaries.
[02:35:12.546 --> 02:35:19.089]  I've seen We Are Change Los Angeles people get beat up by the cops for having a video camera on the street.
[02:35:19.089 --> 02:35:25.112]  I've seen the other folks that went into the live program.
[02:35:25.112 --> 02:35:29.094]  They're on HBO with Bill Maher.
[02:35:29.094 --> 02:35:30.855]  They've done a lot of good work.
[02:35:30.855 --> 02:35:33.456]  And this time, well here's the headline, We Are Change L.A.
[02:35:33.456 --> 02:35:36.738]  organizer faces terrorist charge.
[02:35:36.738 --> 02:35:39.659]  And so we'll spend about ten minutes with him and then go back to your calls.
[02:35:39.659 --> 02:35:41.020]  But finishing up with
[02:35:43.416 --> 02:35:44.836]  Truthmaster in Florida.
[02:35:44.836 --> 02:35:48.818]  You had one other point you wanted to make, Truthmaster.
[02:35:48.818 --> 02:35:53.959]  Yes, and I would say this is one of the most important points of the day.
[02:35:53.959 --> 02:35:57.680]  In regards to the New World Order, that's a failed elite plan.
[02:35:57.680 --> 02:36:04.382]  There's a true plan that there's no stopping that I like to refer to as the true world order.
[02:36:04.382 --> 02:36:10.564]  And that is what's going to be inheriting the Earth here coming shortly after the extinction of most of the lower 92% of the population.
[02:36:12.256 --> 02:36:24.148]  And so my point I just wanted to put out to most people, as a Freemason myself, you need to get yourselves ascended to a higher top 10% in the categories of everyone else who's alive right now.
[02:36:24.148 --> 02:36:27.792]  If you can't, I'm sorry, but you're just not going to be able to make it.
[02:36:27.792 --> 02:36:35.320]  Only those people who've got their minds completely awakened and enlightened, enlightenment is the key, awakening of the egoic consciousness,
[02:36:36.141 --> 02:36:40.424]  Only those people who can pass those tests and those trials are going to survive.
[02:36:56.577 --> 02:37:01.982]  That they are going to purge the earth of at least 90% of us because our consciousness isn't right.
[02:37:01.982 --> 02:37:06.205]  But I see these very globalists as the ones causing so many of our problems.
[02:37:06.205 --> 02:37:12.290]  And so what you're saying is pure, you know, New World Order speak.
[02:37:12.290 --> 02:37:15.693]  I mean, is this what they teach at your Masonic Lodge?
[02:37:15.693 --> 02:37:16.974]  Well, here's the difference.
[02:37:16.974 --> 02:37:20.077]  Here's where the confusion comes in.
[02:37:20.077 --> 02:37:22.499]  As hard as it may be to understand, the elite
[02:37:23.288 --> 02:37:24.289]  They're pawns.
[02:37:24.289 --> 02:37:29.971]  They're just being used, and they think they're building their new world order, and yet they're only setting up the true world order.
[02:37:29.971 --> 02:37:30.892]  No, no, I understand.
[02:37:30.892 --> 02:37:51.542]  They're being used to test the true Illuminati, and by them oppressing the people, it will force the true humans to rise up and take dominion over the planet, and so that the real Illuminati... I mean, I had, you know, a business, a computer company owner here in town tell me, you know, Alex, you know, you're really the Illuminati because you're fighting tyranny.
[02:37:52.122 --> 02:37:52.742]  That's true.
[02:37:52.742 --> 02:37:53.143]  That's 100% true.
[02:37:53.143 --> 02:37:54.123]  But like I said, it's just
[02:38:15.157 --> 02:38:21.630]  I don't know how you would... Flushing out the true inheritance of seeds that were placed long ago that are now gone.
[02:38:21.630 --> 02:38:22.972]  Who do you believe Lucifer is?
[02:38:24.525 --> 02:38:27.186]  Lucifer is the Eastern Star.
[02:38:27.186 --> 02:38:31.867]  He is... The Morning Star, which Christ is also referred to.
[02:38:31.867 --> 02:38:34.088]  That's where you guys get that he's Lucifer.
[02:38:34.088 --> 02:38:41.150]  Guys, pull up, go to YouTube, Mason says he worships Lucifer or Sweet Lucifer.
[02:38:41.150 --> 02:38:43.670]  You can walk up to a high-level Mason and most of them will admit it.
[02:38:43.670 --> 02:38:44.811]  Like, you got the camera off?
[02:38:44.811 --> 02:38:45.651]  Yes, I love Lucifer.
[02:38:45.891 --> 02:38:46.851]  Lucifer is so good.
[02:38:46.851 --> 02:38:47.552]  Oh my God.
[02:38:47.552 --> 02:38:48.972]  Lucifer is soon going to be here with us.
[02:38:48.972 --> 02:38:50.072]  Oh, it's so wonderful!
[02:38:50.072 --> 02:38:54.234]  And meanwhile, those very masons are on TV going, there's no occult.
[02:38:54.234 --> 02:38:55.814]  There's no New World Order.
[02:38:55.814 --> 02:38:59.496]  We've got a local program to get your kids in a DNA database.
[02:38:59.496 --> 02:39:01.896]  We are going to help everyone.
[02:39:01.896 --> 02:39:03.897]  So Lucifer is loving?
[02:39:03.897 --> 02:39:06.378]  Is Lucifer pure and virtuous and good?
[02:39:07.614 --> 02:39:09.976]  Lucifer is a pawn himself.
[02:39:09.976 --> 02:39:11.076]  A pawn.
[02:39:11.076 --> 02:39:22.444]  He is also a pawn that is being used to corrupt these high-level people who have souls that do not have the ability to withstand against these tyrannies and these evils.
[02:39:22.444 --> 02:39:23.645]  Listen, I appreciate your call.
[02:39:23.925 --> 02:39:29.267]  Okay, I'm just telling you, out of that whole Masonic thing you're into flows this.
[02:39:29.267 --> 02:39:32.708]  And the low-level Masons, they're not even aware that it's a cult.
[02:39:32.708 --> 02:39:41.072]  And then people that get into the inner sanctums of Freemasonry, you know, they find out that it is Lucifer, but Lucifer's really Jesus.
[02:39:41.072 --> 02:39:49.435]  And look, any religion where it's secret, any religion where they've got an outer temple and an inner temple, you better look out, okay?
[02:39:51.007 --> 02:40:08.151]  Okay, any religion where you're not allowed to know what's going on, you know, and what the secret inner priesthood is doing, any government, any system, any governmental system that operates like that, you better watch it, okay?
[02:40:08.151 --> 02:40:13.932]  Because it's always about that inner group manipulating and controlling the outer group, but I'm done talking about it.
[02:40:15.911 --> 02:40:20.774]  Oh boy, let me just hit this article and then we'll go to Bruno, who really needs your help right now.
[02:40:20.774 --> 02:40:26.458]  And I've seen this so many times, it just shows the bonafide tyranny we're living under in this nation.
[02:40:26.458 --> 02:40:38.647]  And I've seen it over and over again, and we've had guests on, like the guest who exposed government corruption, so that a year and a half the judge has held the guy on contempt, without a contempt hearing, and has now told him you'll be in prison for life, in the jail.
[02:40:40.054 --> 02:40:42.736]  I mean, you know, just, just, this is tyranny.
[02:40:42.736 --> 02:40:44.318]  Take him away to the dungeon!
[02:40:44.318 --> 02:40:45.178]  Take him away!
[02:40:45.178 --> 02:40:47.740]  You done with you?
[02:40:47.740 --> 02:40:51.444]  We'll talk to you in thirty years after you've been clapped in irons.
[02:40:51.444 --> 02:40:54.926]  That will teach you rabble, the respect of the crown.
[02:40:54.926 --> 02:40:57.268]  That's basically what we're talking about here.
[02:40:58.744 --> 02:41:00.184]  But here's the big news.
[02:41:00.184 --> 02:41:02.465]  This, to me, is the big kahuna.
[02:41:02.465 --> 02:41:03.966]  This is what matters.
[02:41:03.966 --> 02:41:11.608]  Iran threatens to stop Western ships if subjected to cargo inspection.
[02:41:11.608 --> 02:41:23.171]  Iran's parliament has warned it will respond in kind to inspections of its ships under a fourth round of sanctions imposed on the country by the UN Security Council.
[02:41:23.171 --> 02:41:27.213]  A new round of sanctions are being drafted by the United States and the European Union.
[02:41:27.213 --> 02:41:27.893]  We warn
[02:41:29.380 --> 02:41:30.021]  The U.S.
[02:41:30.021 --> 02:41:44.573]  and certain adventurous countries that if they are tempted to inspect Iranian air and ship cargoes, we will take tough action against their ships in the Persian Gulf and Sea of Oman, said Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Larjani.
[02:41:45.874 --> 02:41:54.180]  On Wednesday evening, Larjani said any retaliation move will be part of the country's policy to defend national interest, according to the Fars News Agency.
[02:41:54.180 --> 02:41:58.783]  That's their main national publication, state-owned system.
[02:41:58.783 --> 02:42:10.892]  The Iranian parliament calls the government to not lessen the level of uranium enrichment below 20% since these countries have violated the Non-Proliferation Treaty and refused to provide 20% enriched fuel for Tehran's research reactor.
[02:42:10.892 --> 02:42:14.455]  Yeah, Tehran has asked for uranium that cannot be used in any weapon.
[02:42:14.935 --> 02:42:17.017]  Then they offered to give their uranium to France.
[02:42:17.017 --> 02:42:17.957]  They said no.
[02:42:17.957 --> 02:42:18.738]  Then to Turkey.
[02:42:18.738 --> 02:42:18.998]  No.
[02:42:18.998 --> 02:42:19.839]  Then Brazil.
[02:42:19.839 --> 02:42:20.619]  No!
[02:42:20.619 --> 02:42:21.560]  No!
[02:42:21.560 --> 02:42:23.622]  First Obama said, yeah, give it to Turkey.
[02:42:23.622 --> 02:42:25.603]  They'll enrich it to prove it isn't for bombs.
[02:42:25.603 --> 02:42:27.004]  Okay, here's all our uranium.
[02:42:27.004 --> 02:42:28.585]  No, that deal's off the table now.
[02:42:28.585 --> 02:42:30.767]  We're moving nukes, subs in, and aircraft carriers.
[02:42:30.767 --> 02:42:32.688]  We're going to start boarding your ships.
[02:42:32.688 --> 02:42:34.190]  Nothing's allowed in.
[02:42:34.190 --> 02:42:37.132]  They can only refine roughly half of the oil.
[02:42:37.132 --> 02:42:38.973]  Okay, they have a lot of oil, but not the refinery system.
[02:42:38.973 --> 02:42:39.634]  Those are expensive.
[02:42:40.782 --> 02:42:43.265]  I mean, it's hard to build up a society, folks.
[02:42:43.265 --> 02:42:45.028]  It's hard to build up a civilization.
[02:42:45.028 --> 02:42:45.809]  And this isn't cheap.
[02:42:45.809 --> 02:42:48.032]  That's why when they blew up Belgrade, it was such a problem.
[02:42:48.032 --> 02:42:51.777]  They blow up anything with bombardments that's self-sufficient.
[02:42:51.777 --> 02:42:55.602]  And so, Iran's getting self-sufficient, and the globalists are like, we're going to blow the hell out of you!
[02:42:56.960 --> 02:43:11.279]  And Muslims are going to ride all over the world, the Iranians are going to go into Iraq, the globalists will stage terror attacks, say Iran did it, and World War III is off the races, and China said they may get involved, and so is Russia.
[02:43:11.279 --> 02:43:13.502]  I mean, folks, this is serious business!
[02:43:14.861 --> 02:43:19.767]  But, you know, once our ships are getting hit by missiles and there's death, the American flags are going to go out.
[02:43:19.767 --> 02:43:24.272]  Good old boys are going to be, I don't care if the government's got to raise my taxes.
[02:43:24.272 --> 02:43:26.415]  Forget what happened with the economy.
[02:43:26.415 --> 02:43:30.280]  We're in a war and I want to kill me an Arab!
[02:43:34.386 --> 02:43:37.428]  And then you won't worry about Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan ripping you off.
[02:43:37.428 --> 02:43:40.229]  You won't worry about the open borders and the illegal aliens.
[02:43:40.229 --> 02:43:41.910]  You won't worry about all the tyranny.
[02:43:41.910 --> 02:43:45.993]  You won't worry about that because you're going to be in a war!
[02:43:45.993 --> 02:43:50.075]  And while they're getting their war ready, they blew that oil cap.
[02:43:50.075 --> 02:43:53.297]  Every piece of evidence points at that as a pretext.
[02:43:54.705 --> 02:44:00.209]  You know, I love Lindsey Williams, but no, I don't think the elite knew this was coming and dumped their stock because they had a Ouija board.
[02:44:00.209 --> 02:44:03.511]  They knew what was coming and they dumped the stock because they pulled this.
[02:44:03.511 --> 02:44:11.136]  Either they ordered it to be done, or the evidence is showing that for two weeks the people on those oil rigs were throwing fits, saying, look, this is going to blow up.
[02:44:11.136 --> 02:44:13.057]  This has never been done this way.
[02:44:13.057 --> 02:44:15.919]  You're not putting cement in and mud, you're putting water in.
[02:44:15.919 --> 02:44:16.999]  This is going to blow out.
[02:44:16.999 --> 02:44:17.840]  This is dangerous.
[02:44:19.315 --> 02:44:25.320]  So they gave them orders that they knew were going to cause it to blow up for the political diversion you now see.
[02:44:25.320 --> 02:44:31.164]  I told you 50-something days ago Obama was going to call for a carbon tax to clean this up.
[02:44:31.164 --> 02:44:32.265]  And now what's he done?
[02:44:32.265 --> 02:44:33.806]  I mean, come on!
[02:44:33.806 --> 02:44:35.888]  Come on!
[02:44:35.888 --> 02:44:43.554]  The reason this oil thing is big news is the feds wouldn't let the states protect themselves because the feds are out of control and the states have been castrated.
[02:44:45.973 --> 02:44:47.894]  Why did the states follow?
[02:44:47.894 --> 02:44:51.177]  I mean, that's an issue for people in Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama.
[02:44:51.177 --> 02:44:56.720]  Why are you letting your state houses sit there until it was too late and not put up their own booms, their own sand berms?
[02:44:56.720 --> 02:45:04.165]  Why did you let Barack Hussein, Barry Sotaro, Obama tell you what to do?
[02:45:04.165 --> 02:45:08.949]  Meanwhile, while we're talking about this, they're getting ready for World War III and the banks are stealing trillions a month!
[02:45:10.285 --> 02:45:12.386]  Alright, I'm going to shut up now and get to this important article.
[02:45:12.386 --> 02:45:14.067]  It's up at WeAreChange.org.
[02:45:14.067 --> 02:45:16.409]  It's also up at InfoWars.com.
[02:45:16.409 --> 02:45:17.249]  WeAreChange L.A.
[02:45:17.249 --> 02:45:20.031]  organizer faces terrorist charge.
[02:45:20.031 --> 02:45:20.791]  And you can read it.
[02:45:20.791 --> 02:45:22.993]  He was making faces the judge didn't like.
[02:45:22.993 --> 02:45:24.233]  And I see this all the time now.
[02:45:24.233 --> 02:45:25.934]  And the cops grabbed him.
[02:45:25.934 --> 02:45:26.615]  He didn't resist.
[02:45:26.615 --> 02:45:28.096]  There's witnesses to this.
[02:45:28.096 --> 02:45:30.217]  And they said, we don't care, boy, you attacked us.
[02:45:30.217 --> 02:45:31.458]  And this is the new thing.
[02:45:31.458 --> 02:45:35.040]  Cops will beat you up on camera and send you to... Remember Kelly Rushing?
[02:45:35.580 --> 02:45:42.265]  They charged him with threatening police for giving him a Ron Paul, and in one of my videos charged him one count for each video.
[02:45:42.265 --> 02:45:48.210]  And then it was in the news, they said he's facing, was it two counts, three years, six years, seven years?
[02:45:48.210 --> 02:45:50.372]  In prison for giving out videos.
[02:45:50.372 --> 02:45:52.213]  A lot of these cops don't see us as humans.
[02:45:52.213 --> 02:45:55.556]  They enjoy throwing milk cows in prison.
[02:45:55.556 --> 02:45:57.317]  We are seen as slaves.
[02:45:57.317 --> 02:46:00.080]  And when a slave gets uppity, they gotta be put in their place.
[02:46:00.760 --> 02:46:10.686]  Well, a slave out in L.A., command base central for the New World Order on the West Coast, they're trying to send this 9-11 truther, who I know, Bruno Breweiler, to the Huskow.
[02:46:10.686 --> 02:46:12.968]  Bruno, tell us what you're facing and how we can help you.
[02:46:14.540 --> 02:46:16.602]  Hi Alex, thanks for having me on.
[02:46:16.602 --> 02:46:22.207]  Yeah, I'm facing, if they succeed with their charges, I'm facing three years in prison.
[02:46:22.207 --> 02:46:30.675]  They charged me with two felony resisting arrest, which means I got violent, but there's witnesses that said, when asked me to turn around and put my hands behind my back.
[02:46:30.675 --> 02:46:32.616]  But it's going to be their word against a God.
[02:46:32.616 --> 02:46:33.717]  Their word against a God.
[02:46:33.717 --> 02:46:35.599]  You're just a scum American.
[02:46:35.599 --> 02:46:37.240]  But please continue.
[02:46:37.240 --> 02:46:39.823]  Okay, yeah, so that's on, but tell folks how this all started though.
[02:46:40.819 --> 02:46:46.523]  Oh, I was in court in the audience for a friend and the judge didn't like the facial expressions I was making.
[02:46:46.523 --> 02:46:51.486]  I mean, if I were nodding in agreement with her, then of course she wouldn't have said anything.
[02:46:51.486 --> 02:46:54.208]  And I wasn't even aware of the facial expressions.
[02:47:12.160 --> 02:47:31.017]  Uh, so I walked out, she told the bailiffs to take me out, or to remove me, but I walked out on my own accord, no resistance, they closed the door behind me, and I just asked the police officers for their IDs, which they're required to by law to show their IDs, and before I knew it, they asked me to turn around and put my hands behind my back.
[02:47:31.017 --> 02:47:35.300]  Boy, you did get up and you actually talked to a god?
[02:47:36.221 --> 02:47:37.862]  Yeah.
[02:47:37.862 --> 02:47:40.923]  They called me crazy because I was standing up for my rights.
[02:47:40.923 --> 02:47:43.464]  I was speaking, you know, about the right.
[02:47:43.464 --> 02:47:47.426]  Did Moses look directly at God or did he look at a burning bush?
[02:47:47.426 --> 02:47:51.707]  You don't, you don't, you don't, you're, I mean, you don't, again, this is God level.
[02:47:51.707 --> 02:47:55.909]  You don't look upon the face of your king, your leader.
[02:47:55.909 --> 02:47:59.710]  The blood flows through your veins because of those police, those bailiffs.
[02:47:59.710 --> 02:48:00.971]  I'm going to quit being sarcastic.
[02:48:00.971 --> 02:48:02.492]  You're facing serious jail time.
[02:48:02.492 --> 02:48:03.332]  So what happened next?
[02:48:05.538 --> 02:48:19.545]  Uh, they packed on a terrorist threat, uh, and the whole time I was just speaking about the importance of the police work with the people in relation, you know, the police need to be with the people and not with the, uh, enforcing the fraud of the courts.
[02:48:20.965 --> 02:48:23.769]  You know, this guy was just out of control.
[02:48:23.769 --> 02:48:25.410]  He's a hothead.
[02:48:25.410 --> 02:48:29.115]  He just slapped major felony charges against me.
[02:48:29.115 --> 02:48:32.178]  You know, it's just ruthless and tyrannical.
[02:48:32.178 --> 02:48:35.963]  And so I'm going to the courts right now, and I need money.
[02:48:35.963 --> 02:48:37.104]  I need help.
[02:48:37.104 --> 02:48:38.285]  This is very expensive.
[02:48:45.830 --> 02:48:47.651]  Here's the deal.
[02:48:47.651 --> 02:48:54.014]  We need official oppression, racketeering, civil rights violation, you know, frame up here.
[02:48:54.014 --> 02:48:59.377]  What you need is a good constitutional lawyer in the Southern California area that wants to protect you.
[02:48:59.377 --> 02:49:00.118]  We got that.
[02:49:01.314 --> 02:49:14.219]  Or Jeremy Talus, goes by German Talus, when they did the Bush setup with the girl in the wheelchair for Fox News, came out of the dark, and then they said, you know, you're facing a decade in prison, he wouldn't plea bargain.
[02:49:14.219 --> 02:49:17.360]  The Secret Service agent got up on stand and said, I will not lie.
[02:49:17.360 --> 02:49:21.742]  They attacked him, and they had to release him, and the New York Post had to retract.
[02:49:21.742 --> 02:49:26.524]  With you it's the same deal, and you need a constitutional lawyer.
[02:49:26.524 --> 02:49:27.444]  How do they contact you?
[02:49:29.399 --> 02:49:35.724]  Uh, you can reach me at, uh, through the, uh, if I give you the email address.
[02:49:35.724 --> 02:49:39.427]  I don't want to give my email address, but with the, uh, the radio.
[02:49:39.427 --> 02:49:44.250]  Yeah, Bruno, we want to help you, so, so is there a way for people to get in touch with you?
[02:49:44.250 --> 02:49:47.413]  Yeah, contact me through the, you know what, I'll just go into it.
[02:49:47.413 --> 02:49:58.201]  It's B-B-R-U-H-W-I-L-E-R, and the number eight, that's my first initial and last name, bbruiler8 at gmail.com.
[02:49:59.225 --> 02:50:04.869]  Uh, you go to WACLA.org, that's W-A-C-L-A dot org.
[02:50:04.869 --> 02:50:10.253]  And also, uh, there's free-bruno.org.
[02:50:10.253 --> 02:50:15.017]  And I, I gotta, these, there's a lot of fans out there of yours that have helped me.
[02:50:15.017 --> 02:50:17.399]  I gotta, uh, throw out some names.
[02:50:17.399 --> 02:50:24.304]  David in Chile, Alejandro, and my brother Jay Black and his company, JoomlaXPC.
[02:50:24.304 --> 02:50:25.284]  They're huge fans.
[02:50:25.284 --> 02:50:27.126]  These are all truthers around the world.
[02:50:27.686 --> 02:50:34.510]  They're my brothers, and we're Change Hauling, that's Robin and Paul, and we're Change New York, Dan, and everyone here in L.A.
[02:50:34.510 --> 02:50:37.151]  has been so, the love has been unbelievable.
[02:50:37.151 --> 02:50:44.215]  Well, Bruno, that is awesome, but again, especially in L.A., they're just, take them away to the dungeon.
[02:50:44.215 --> 02:50:53.660]  There's no judge, no jury, no nothing, you're just gone, but in this case, there is a judge whose sickness thugs on you, and these guys are so inhuman.
[02:50:54.588 --> 02:51:00.268]  They've had their souls sucked out to the point of you're not human to them and all they want to do is put you in prison.
[02:51:01.229 --> 02:51:01.910]  You worry.
[02:51:01.910 --> 02:51:04.271]  If you don't, you don't understand the situation.
[02:51:04.271 --> 02:51:04.812]  Hi.
[02:51:04.812 --> 02:51:07.594]  Summer's coming, and now's the time to learn self-sufficiency.
[02:51:07.594 --> 02:51:12.138]  If you're going to eat from nature's bounty of wild edible plants, remember, there's a learning curve.
[02:51:12.138 --> 02:51:14.600]  Experience is the best teacher, but that means time.
[02:51:14.600 --> 02:51:17.962]  To speed it up, you'll need to build on the wisdom of a teacher who has lived it.
[02:51:17.962 --> 02:51:19.904]  Author Linda Runyon is that teacher.
[02:51:19.904 --> 02:51:22.686]  Her Wild Food Knowledge Package is the crash course.
[02:51:22.686 --> 02:51:26.409]  The DVD gives you a three-hour overview of her world directly from her.
[02:51:26.409 --> 02:51:30.452]  The book gives you an in-depth reference with all of the insider know-how you'll ever need.
[02:51:30.812 --> 02:51:34.893]  And her wild cards are your portable summary and cheat sheet for your fieldwork.
[02:51:34.893 --> 02:51:41.235]  This three-pronged learning system will take you from spectator to scholar to gourmet survivalist in weeks, not years.
[02:51:41.235 --> 02:51:43.576]  Folks, I can vouch that Linda's the real deal.
[02:51:43.576 --> 02:51:45.697]  She's my mom, and I watched her do it.
[02:51:45.697 --> 02:51:50.358]  So go to ofthefield.com or call 888-51-EAT-FREE.
[02:51:50.358 --> 02:51:51.259]  Start now.
[02:51:51.259 --> 02:51:52.979]  Knowledge is power.
[02:51:52.979 --> 02:51:53.980]  Better take action.
[02:51:53.980 --> 02:51:54.940]  I think a storm's coming.
[02:52:01.326 --> 02:52:03.707]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[02:52:03.707 --> 02:52:06.028]  We are part of a New World Order.
[02:52:06.028 --> 02:52:09.250]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[02:52:09.250 --> 02:52:14.353]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[02:52:14.353 --> 02:52:18.555]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[02:52:18.855 --> 02:52:21.319]  It means all the world under their control.
[02:52:21.319 --> 02:52:23.762]  The United Nations would take over America.
[02:52:23.762 --> 02:52:27.007]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[02:52:27.007 --> 02:52:34.618]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[02:52:34.938 --> 02:52:40.342]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[02:52:40.342 --> 02:52:43.183]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[02:52:43.183 --> 02:52:46.866]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[02:52:46.866 --> 02:52:47.947]  And I got news for you.
[02:52:47.947 --> 02:52:49.287]  You're everyone else.
[02:52:49.287 --> 02:52:50.788]  Invisible Empire.

[02:53:00.757 --> 02:53:04.360]  It's the number one reason for slow and clogged bath drains.
[02:53:04.360 --> 02:53:06.021]  That's right, hair.
[02:53:06.021 --> 02:53:09.224]  And the number one way to open drains plugged with hair?
[02:53:09.224 --> 02:53:11.125]  The drain claw.
[02:53:11.125 --> 02:53:13.327]  Stop standing in dirty bath water.
[02:53:13.327 --> 02:53:15.228]  Stop using dangerous chemicals.
[02:53:15.228 --> 02:53:19.672]  Just push the drain claw past the pop-up in your sink or tub, twist, and pull.
[02:53:19.672 --> 02:53:23.335]  You'll be shocked at what this little tool can pull out of your drain.

[02:53:51.282 --> 02:53:52.743]  Buy the Drain Claw.

[02:54:11.653 --> 02:54:17.375]  We got Lindsey Williams coming up because our listeners wanted to be able to talk to him and ask him questions.
[02:54:17.375 --> 02:54:24.017]  We'll have to clear the phone lines out once he's on with us and just open the phones up for specific questions for Lindsey Williams at 1-800-259-9231.
[02:54:29.807 --> 02:54:39.592]  Bruno Breweiler of We Are Change L.A., a great guy, we've interviewed him four or five times in the past with news stories they've been working on out in Los Angeles.
[02:54:39.592 --> 02:54:49.377]  And it's a real shame to see this, and look, I don't like bashing police, but police are the enforcers for this out-of-control, illegitimate government.
[02:54:49.377 --> 02:54:50.138]  And more and more
[02:54:51.425 --> 02:55:01.449]  We've all seen the videos of cops just beating the daylights out of somebody and then setting them up and charging them with attacking the cops.
[02:55:01.449 --> 02:55:02.509]  On video!
[02:55:02.509 --> 02:55:05.871]  Cops don't care you have video of them beating you up.
[02:55:05.871 --> 02:55:09.152]  They will then say, it's not enough I broke your nose.
[02:55:09.152 --> 02:55:10.893]  I'm going to charge you with assaulting me now.
[02:55:11.753 --> 02:55:14.174]  And Bruno's got all these witnesses.
[02:55:14.174 --> 02:55:17.654]  You need to subpoena the surveillance camera tapes.
[02:55:17.654 --> 02:55:22.476]  And just don't plea bargain, whatever you do, and push it all the way to a trial.
[02:55:22.476 --> 02:55:28.097]  And just literally almost wear a mask or the judge will say you're being disrespectful, life in prison.
[02:55:28.097 --> 02:55:29.877]  And I'm not joking about Los Angeles.
[02:55:29.877 --> 02:55:36.039]  I mean, it is just a pit of evil where real criminals are released, citizens.
[02:55:36.039 --> 02:55:38.280]  Look, it's about letting slaves know.
[02:55:38.280 --> 02:55:39.020]  It's like the movie
[02:55:40.287 --> 02:55:41.008]  It's not ants.
[02:55:41.008 --> 02:55:42.631]  What's the name of it?
[02:55:42.631 --> 02:55:44.854]  About a bug's life.
[02:55:44.854 --> 02:55:50.483]  Where they say if we let one of those ants stand up to us, they'll all stand up.
[02:55:50.483 --> 02:55:51.624]  And I've seen it.
[02:55:51.624 --> 02:55:52.806]  I mean, I've experienced it.
[02:55:55.356 --> 02:55:58.520]  Cops are now taught, look, citizens are scum.
[02:55:58.520 --> 02:56:01.183]  It's better just to get them in the criminal justice system.
[02:56:01.183 --> 02:56:03.326]  That way we get their Second Amendment rights.
[02:56:03.326 --> 02:56:05.088]  That way they're in the system.
[02:56:05.088 --> 02:56:06.730]  So go ahead and frame people.
[02:56:06.730 --> 02:56:08.292]  Go ahead and get them to the system.
[02:56:08.292 --> 02:56:09.974]  This is how we protect America.
[02:56:09.974 --> 02:56:12.297]  They've been taught that criminality is good.
[02:56:12.297 --> 02:56:14.600]  Now how many cops are bearing false witness against you?
[02:56:16.906 --> 02:56:22.689]  There's two main ones and probably a third one.
[02:56:22.689 --> 02:56:23.709]  I should say bailiffs.
[02:56:23.709 --> 02:56:27.451]  Are these bailiffs or cops?
[02:56:27.451 --> 02:56:30.112]  They're cops in the court.
[02:56:30.112 --> 02:56:32.153]  So these are court worshippers.
[02:56:32.153 --> 02:56:42.838]  These are Praetorian Guard who are there every day where kids are being taken, money's being taken, the court's gorging itself fat and bloated like a giant tick off the people of L.A.
[02:56:42.838 --> 02:56:45.559]  Here comes a slave that gets up and away to the dungeon.
[02:56:46.536 --> 02:56:48.377]  Yep, exactly.
[02:56:48.377 --> 02:56:51.798]  And, uh, it takes, you know, I've got, again, I've got a strong case.
[02:56:51.798 --> 02:56:56.059]  If I can get a good attorney, uh, who will stand up to the judges.
[02:56:56.059 --> 02:57:01.041]  You know, I'm being, you know, even in the court, they're railroading me through the procedures.
[02:57:01.041 --> 02:57:04.402]  They're violating procedural, uh, processes.
[02:57:04.402 --> 02:57:07.543]  And, uh, so I need someone who can stand up to the judge.
[02:57:07.543 --> 02:57:08.783]  Well, you need to put continuances in.
[02:57:08.783 --> 02:57:09.924]  You need to prepare your case.
[02:57:10.816 --> 02:57:12.818]  Yeah, we've got one continuing 10.
[02:57:12.818 --> 02:57:15.760]  We've got a few weeks.
[02:57:15.760 --> 02:57:17.181]  Tell me about these cops, though.
[02:57:17.181 --> 02:57:22.245]  I mean, did their eyes glare with pleasure as they set you up and let you know you were being charged?
[02:57:22.245 --> 02:57:23.626]  Little man!
[02:57:23.626 --> 02:57:24.846]  Little American!
[02:57:24.846 --> 02:57:25.947]  I've got you!
[02:57:25.947 --> 02:57:27.348]  I'm ruining your future!
[02:57:27.348 --> 02:57:29.430]  I lie about people all day!
[02:57:29.430 --> 02:57:30.691]  And I pack the prisons!
[02:57:30.691 --> 02:57:32.092]  I'm a hardcore crook!
[02:57:33.177 --> 02:57:38.460]  You should have seen the pleasure on his face when he said, oh, I'm going to charge you with terrorist threat.
[02:57:38.460 --> 02:57:40.381]  And he made his underling be a witness.
[02:57:40.381 --> 02:57:43.543]  You're going to be a witness in order to be a false witness.
[02:57:43.543 --> 02:57:46.164]  And he had this glee, his smile on his face.
[02:57:46.164 --> 02:57:46.885]  Oh, yes.
[02:57:48.101 --> 02:57:49.342]  Oh, yes!
[02:57:49.342 --> 02:57:49.462]  Oh!
[02:57:49.462 --> 02:57:52.843]  Oh, there's so many Americans to dominate!
[02:57:52.843 --> 02:57:56.525]  This government's given us so much power to abuse them!
[02:57:56.525 --> 02:57:58.425]  Thank you, New World Order!
[02:57:58.425 --> 02:57:58.966]  Thank you!
[02:57:58.966 --> 02:58:03.828]  There's no end to these slaves, and they bend over to all of it!
[02:58:03.828 --> 02:58:05.569]  Oh, give us everything!
[02:58:05.569 --> 02:58:08.510]  I'll give the bankers all the money, just give me petty power!
[02:58:09.150 --> 02:58:15.976]  And that's the worst part about a tyranny, is all these petty nobodies get to just run wild and have this false status over everyone else.
[02:58:15.976 --> 02:58:18.298]  Bruno, we're in your corner.
[02:58:18.298 --> 02:58:19.579]  Give people the... Hey.
[02:58:19.579 --> 02:58:20.380]  Yep, go ahead.
[02:58:20.380 --> 02:58:23.042]  Tell people to go to wacla.org.
[02:58:23.042 --> 02:58:24.423]  There's a chip in there.
[02:58:24.423 --> 02:58:25.244]  Please go there.
[02:58:25.244 --> 02:58:28.306]  It's easy to donate.
[02:58:28.306 --> 02:58:29.067]  Any amount.
[02:58:29.067 --> 02:58:29.407]  $5, $10, $100.
[02:58:29.407 --> 02:58:30.508]  Whatever you can give.
[02:58:30.508 --> 02:58:32.230]  Bruno, we're out of time.
[02:58:32.230 --> 02:58:33.631]  Bruno, we'll talk to you as this develops.
[02:58:34.855 --> 02:58:36.077]  Absolutely.
[02:58:36.077 --> 02:58:36.698]  We're out of time.
[02:58:36.698 --> 02:58:38.561]  Alright, we're going to come back with the next hour.
[02:58:38.561 --> 02:58:41.345]  Stay with us.

[02:58:55.733 --> 02:59:00.958]  This is an American made product of the highest quality and compares to nothing you will find in stores.

[02:59:10.887 --> 02:59:12.028]  Take my word for it.
[02:59:12.028 --> 02:59:14.671]  Once you've used pure soap, you won't buy anything else.
[02:59:14.671 --> 02:59:21.196]  Since 1947, Calbin Soap Company has been showing consumers that soap can be tough on dirt and gentle on the environment.
[02:59:21.196 --> 02:59:22.698]  Buy American and stay clean.

[02:59:48.976 --> 02:59:53.977]  Thank you.
[02:59:53.977 --> 02:59:56.338]  Waging war on corruption.
[02:59:56.338 --> 02:59:59.139]  Alex Jones on the GCM Radio Network.
[03:00:10.767 --> 03:00:18.611]  All right, my friends, we are back live.
[03:00:18.611 --> 03:00:20.952]  This is the fourth and final hour.
[03:00:20.952 --> 03:00:22.893]  I've got some other important news.
[03:00:22.893 --> 03:00:32.999]  I'll be interspersing in the intro to each segment on other subjects, but I wanted to get Lindsey Williams on for an update and to take your phone calls in this final hour.
[03:00:33.559 --> 03:00:49.707]  Lindsay Williams, of course, a pastor, a pilot, worked for many years in the rough oil fields of Alaska, got hired to be part of Atlantic Richfield and other board meetings, got to know some top globalists, one of them who has attended Bilderberg meetings.
[03:00:49.707 --> 03:00:53.629]  Dr. Stan Monteith and I have both confirmed and know the individual he's talking about.
[03:00:53.629 --> 03:00:55.350]  We know he has the source.
[03:00:55.350 --> 03:01:01.794]  And a lot of what he talked about a week and a half ago or so here on air has now come out, that the leak is
[03:01:02.813 --> 03:01:04.734]  Many, many times worse than what they said.
[03:01:04.734 --> 03:01:12.700]  It is coming out at a record pressure level, but there is an unusual amount of toxic chemicals mixed in with this oil.
[03:01:12.700 --> 03:01:22.127]  Oil always has quite a bit of other toxic elements in it, but this is particularly nasty stuff, and this may be a new strata they've gone into in this super deep well, as they're called.
[03:01:23.107 --> 03:01:31.053]  But I wanted to get him on with just a brief recap of the info he covered last week, and then I got a bunch of calls about it.
[03:01:31.053 --> 03:01:32.394]  I didn't hear it myself.
[03:01:32.394 --> 03:01:41.021]  He was on coast-to-coast with George Norring and said, George, if the American people knew who was in control of their military, they would be very upset.
[03:01:41.621 --> 03:01:48.346]  Well, I know the Army War College and Thomas Barnett and the Naval War College brags that it's totally run by offshore banks and the Federal Reserve.
[03:01:48.346 --> 03:01:54.331]  I don't know if that's the intel Williams was given, but he's here with us today and I'm going to have to wipe the phone lines.
[03:01:54.331 --> 03:01:55.852]  Sorry to those that we're holding.
[03:01:55.852 --> 03:01:57.313]  Or you know what?
[03:01:57.313 --> 03:01:58.754]  I guess we can go to those that we're holding.
[03:01:58.754 --> 03:02:03.377]  It's just that I want to be able to get to people for Lindsey Williams, so let's be
[03:02:04.238 --> 03:02:08.380]  I guess Alan, Mark, Grant, Andrew, and others.
[03:02:08.380 --> 03:02:12.182]  We're going to get to you.
[03:02:12.182 --> 03:02:14.743]  The 1-800-259-9231 is the toll-free number to join us.
[03:02:14.743 --> 03:02:21.606]  But Lindsey Williams recapping your Inside Intel on the oil spill, and then let's go forward.
[03:02:22.759 --> 03:02:29.742]  Alex, thank you for allowing me the privilege of being here today with you in order to be able to give you an update.
[03:02:29.742 --> 03:02:38.967]  Alex, I've got to say first, before we even begin, I had the most heart-rending radio talk show on yesterday I've ever had in my life.
[03:02:38.967 --> 03:02:41.348]  I'm sure you can hear it in my voice.
[03:02:41.348 --> 03:02:42.949]  I have never been moved this much.
[03:02:42.949 --> 03:02:51.813]  A radio talk show host in Orlando, Florida called me, and he said, Captain Williams, you have got to be on my show immediately.
[03:02:52.432 --> 03:02:54.194]  I told him, I said, I can't, I'm too tired.
[03:02:54.194 --> 03:02:56.376]  I've been day and night with this.
[03:02:56.376 --> 03:02:58.958]  He said, you've got to, you don't have any choice.
[03:02:58.958 --> 03:03:01.580]  He had me on for, he asked me for an hour.
[03:03:01.580 --> 03:03:03.382]  He said, at least give me an hour.
[03:03:03.382 --> 03:03:05.364]  Now, this is Orlando, Florida.
[03:03:05.364 --> 03:03:07.546]  I said, why do you want me on?
[03:03:07.546 --> 03:03:12.870]  He said, Chaplain, I came down with a respiratory problem myself one week ago.
[03:03:12.870 --> 03:03:17.555]  He said, for the past three days, I have wanted to throw up all the time.
[03:03:18.197 --> 03:03:20.521]  He said I felt so nauseated.
[03:03:20.521 --> 03:03:23.025]  He said members of my family have problems.
[03:03:23.025 --> 03:03:25.469]  He said people in Florida are upset.
[03:03:25.469 --> 03:03:27.212]  He said please go on my show.
[03:03:27.212 --> 03:03:29.216]  We went on.
[03:03:29.216 --> 03:03:31.560]  It was the first hour.
[03:03:32.606 --> 03:03:33.667]  I gave my material.
[03:03:33.667 --> 03:03:35.849]  The second hour, Alex, I have never had this.
[03:03:35.849 --> 03:03:38.431]  I've been doing radio shows for 35 years.
[03:03:38.431 --> 03:03:44.056]  Every phone line in his studio lit up and stayed lit up for the entire second hour.
[03:03:44.056 --> 03:03:44.957]  He said, you can't go.
[03:03:44.957 --> 03:03:47.099]  You've got to stay with us.
[03:03:47.099 --> 03:03:48.800]  Alex, I've never heard such a testimony.
[03:03:48.800 --> 03:03:50.902]  These people are getting sick down there.
[03:03:50.902 --> 03:03:55.926]  I mean, there are problems in Florida that'll be... I heard this with my own voice.
[03:03:55.926 --> 03:03:58.088]  This was yesterday.
[03:03:58.088 --> 03:03:58.568]  Right now.
[03:03:59.631 --> 03:04:07.733]  Well, a couple days after you were on... I have never had this many phone calls on any radio show I've ever done in all of my years.
[03:04:07.733 --> 03:04:09.673]  Well, I mean, a few... Sure.
[03:04:09.673 --> 03:04:10.673]  It's heart-rending.
[03:04:10.673 --> 03:04:14.534]  He said, Chaplin, there are only two highways out of Florida.
[03:04:14.534 --> 03:04:15.934]  Two interstates.
[03:04:15.934 --> 03:04:21.195]  And he said, there are two canals that cross both of those interstate highways.
[03:04:21.195 --> 03:04:23.396]  He said they could block us in here.
[03:04:23.396 --> 03:04:24.356]  People were scared.
[03:04:25.057 --> 03:04:31.200]  Now these canals run east and west, and the two interstate highways run north and south.
[03:04:31.200 --> 03:04:34.382]  He said, we messed up here.
[03:04:34.382 --> 03:04:43.706]  He said they could block the highway at those two canals that run east and west, and he said nobody could move in and out of Florida unless they told us we could.
[03:04:43.706 --> 03:04:51.490]  Alex, I just had to mention this because people all over America, they don't realize how desperate it is in Florida.
[03:04:51.770 --> 03:04:53.712]  All right, Lindsey, we've got a break.
[03:04:53.712 --> 03:04:54.913]  We're gonna have to break right here.
[03:04:54.913 --> 03:04:57.315]  We're gonna come back with Lindsey Williams on the other side.
[03:04:57.315 --> 03:04:59.456]  I'm Alex Jones, InfoWars.com.
[03:04:59.456 --> 03:05:00.717]  Stay with us.
[03:05:00.717 --> 03:05:03.019]  They helped to create a new world order.
[03:05:03.019 --> 03:05:05.441]  We are part of a new world order.
[03:05:05.441 --> 03:05:08.644]  A new world order based upon collective action.
[03:05:08.644 --> 03:05:13.748]  Invisible empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:05:13.748 --> 03:05:17.931]  The new world order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:05:18.251 --> 03:05:20.713]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:05:20.713 --> 03:05:23.134]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:05:23.134 --> 03:05:26.396]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:05:26.396 --> 03:05:33.981]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:05:34.318 --> 03:05:39.721]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:05:39.721 --> 03:05:42.562]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:05:42.562 --> 03:05:46.264]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:05:46.264 --> 03:05:47.324]  And I got news for you.
[03:05:47.324 --> 03:05:48.665]  You're everyone else.
[03:05:48.665 --> 03:05:50.166]  Invisible Empire.

[03:06:01.172 --> 03:06:04.173]  Hello, this is Alex Jones with some important questions.
[03:06:04.173 --> 03:06:09.514]  If you're going into a battle and they give you a rifle and a sidearm, how much ammunition do you want?
[03:06:09.514 --> 03:06:11.555]  My answer would be all I can get.
[03:06:11.555 --> 03:06:16.556]  In the battle for freedom and the lives of your loved ones, food is your only ammunition.
[03:06:16.556 --> 03:06:17.737]  How much do you want?
[03:06:17.737 --> 03:06:18.477]  When do you want it?
[03:06:18.857 --> 03:06:20.739]  Now or after the battle starts?
[03:06:20.739 --> 03:06:21.820]  When will you need it?
[03:06:21.820 --> 03:06:24.022]  Can you buy it without proper identification?
[03:06:24.022 --> 03:06:25.363]  Will there be any food?
[03:06:25.363 --> 03:06:26.884]  Will it make your children sick?
[03:06:26.884 --> 03:06:32.169]  If there's a quarantine and you can't feed yourself, will you go to the gathering center and be immunized?
[03:06:32.169 --> 03:06:35.292]  You wipe out all these problems if you have a good food supply.
[03:06:35.732 --> 03:06:39.553]  Food is your ammunition to fight for your freedom and your life.
[03:06:39.553 --> 03:06:40.774]  How much will you need?
[03:06:40.774 --> 03:06:41.694]  We don't know.
[03:06:41.694 --> 03:06:42.795]  How much do you want?
[03:06:42.795 --> 03:06:43.715]  All you can get.
[03:06:43.715 --> 03:06:44.815]  I'm Alex Jones.
[03:06:44.815 --> 03:06:47.857]  I want all of you good guys to live to fight another day.
[03:06:47.857 --> 03:06:49.637]  Call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on the web at efoodsdirect.com.
[03:06:49.637 --> 03:06:50.558]  Again, that number 1-800-409-5633.
[03:07:00.256 --> 03:07:05.238]  The question is, where should the American people draw their line in the sand?
[03:07:05.238 --> 03:07:06.219]  What have we got?
[03:07:06.219 --> 03:07:08.680]  A republic or a monarchy?
[03:07:08.680 --> 03:07:09.680]  A republic.
[03:07:09.680 --> 03:07:12.321]  It's based on a constitution which protects minority rights.
[03:07:12.321 --> 03:07:14.602]  Not democracy, not mob rule.
[03:07:14.602 --> 03:07:16.623]  Two wolves and a sheep voting on what's for dinner.
[03:07:16.623 --> 03:07:18.304]  So they think they own our land?
[03:07:18.304 --> 03:07:19.624]  They think they own our water?
[03:07:19.624 --> 03:07:20.225]  Children?
[03:07:20.225 --> 03:07:21.345]  Our education?
[03:07:21.345 --> 03:07:22.165]  Our money?
[03:07:22.165 --> 03:07:25.827]  We have to define who we are and what we will tolerate.
[03:07:26.187 --> 03:07:31.169]  Somebody's gonna ask you what you did during the Patriot Uprising.
[03:07:31.169 --> 03:07:32.189]  We have the facts.
[03:07:32.189 --> 03:07:33.350]  We have the Constitution.
[03:07:33.350 --> 03:07:34.250]  We have the Bill of Rights.
[03:07:34.250 --> 03:07:35.131]  We have common law.
[03:07:35.131 --> 03:07:37.652]  Knowledge is power, ladies and gentlemen.
[03:07:37.652 --> 03:07:41.433]  And I'm so excited to be able to offer you Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic.
[03:07:41.553 --> 03:07:46.495]  Tyranny is upon us, but liberty and the sleeping giant that is the American people is rising.
[03:07:46.495 --> 03:07:47.995]  A new tool in the Info War.
[03:07:47.995 --> 03:07:49.095]  Don't tread on me.
[03:07:49.095 --> 03:08:01.719]  Order it at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com or call toll free 888-253-3139 and support independent patriotic liberty films.
[03:08:01.719 --> 03:08:04.480]  He's the T-Rex of political talk.
[03:08:04.480 --> 03:08:07.241]  Alex Jones on the GCN Radio Network.
[03:08:15.655 --> 03:08:18.076]  We're going to Lindsey Williams for the rest of the hour.
[03:08:18.076 --> 03:08:21.797]  I may even go into 15-20 minutes of overdrive if he can do it.
[03:08:21.797 --> 03:08:24.477]  Because we've got loaded phones, people don't want to talk to him.
[03:08:24.477 --> 03:08:28.198]  But Rob Dude just got back from Chicago right now.
[03:08:28.198 --> 03:08:29.999]  Five days in Chicago.
[03:08:29.999 --> 03:08:34.320]  We saw a little MSNBC article about troops for five days of terror drill.
[03:08:35.360 --> 03:08:45.548]  And we noticed in the actual press releases put out by the Army that the Army was going to be training with local police in neighborhoods to quote take on American drug dealers and gun owners.
[03:08:47.096 --> 03:08:55.221]  Rob Dude just walked in, just got off the plane, he walked in here totally white-faced, you know, like a ghost, and said, we have it.
[03:08:55.221 --> 03:08:56.822]  And I said, you have what?
[03:08:56.822 --> 03:08:58.723]  He'll be on tomorrow to tell us about it.
[03:08:58.723 --> 03:09:05.907]  But while everybody's looking at the oil spill, which is important, I'm looking at Iran, I'm looking at military drills in Chicago.
[03:09:05.907 --> 03:09:07.708]  Tell folks what you witnessed, dude.
[03:09:07.708 --> 03:09:14.212]  Well, apparently since the mid-90s, the National Guard in Illinois has been working with Poland
[03:09:14.989 --> 03:09:15.229]  I don't
[03:09:40.929 --> 03:09:58.896]  And of course, in Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, that you co-directed with me and Douglas, we had the colonel, we interviewed the colonel, who admitted the Army was training for gun confiscation in Iowa, and I've been to the drills a decade ago, where they were training to take on American gun owners.
[03:09:58.896 --> 03:10:07.699]  Folks, the military is training, it was in NLE-09, 14 nations, 14 nations to take on American gun owners.
[03:10:07.819 --> 03:10:12.322]  I saw it with my own eyes and we have hours of video of this.
[03:10:12.322 --> 03:10:15.364]  Of the guys working together and doing these drills.
[03:10:37.739 --> 03:10:38.359]  Some of them are.
[03:10:38.359 --> 03:10:41.140]  They want us to go to the Gulf.
[03:10:41.140 --> 03:10:42.780]  But I don't have the people!
[03:10:42.780 --> 03:10:45.941]  I mean, am I supposed to give orders to armies that don't exist?
[03:10:45.941 --> 03:10:50.541]  It's like I'm Hitler or something in my bunker giving orders to armies that only exist on maps.
[03:10:50.541 --> 03:10:53.962]  I mean, it's not going on here.
[03:10:53.962 --> 03:10:55.022]  It's pretty crazy.
[03:10:55.022 --> 03:10:59.743]  Another thing that happened, I was filming at the Sears Tower and they're doing road work underneath.
[03:10:59.743 --> 03:11:03.744]  There's these road systems that go underneath the main roads, the street level roads.
[03:11:04.494 --> 03:11:05.775]  And they were all closed off.
[03:11:05.775 --> 03:11:06.777]  I said, well, that's interesting.
[03:11:06.777 --> 03:11:08.578]  I'm going to go down there and start filming that.
[03:11:08.578 --> 03:11:12.783]  And I'm shooting and all of a sudden a guy in a suit appears and said, sir, sir, what are you doing down here?
[03:11:12.783 --> 03:11:14.985]  I said, I'm just, you know, shooting video.
[03:11:14.985 --> 03:11:16.066]  He goes, no, you can't be down here.
[03:11:16.066 --> 03:11:16.987]  You can't be down here.
[03:11:16.987 --> 03:11:17.988]  So what are y'all doing down here?
[03:11:17.988 --> 03:11:23.835]  He goes, oh, it's all roadwork construction, but it's all underneath, you know, where the, it's now called the Willis Tower.
[03:11:23.835 --> 03:11:24.235]  And, uh,
[03:11:24.619 --> 03:11:28.200]  That's another little bit that was just a little side thing that happened.
[03:11:28.200 --> 03:11:30.061]  Oh, it's total mafia takeover.
[03:11:30.061 --> 03:11:33.963]  Listen, get the guys to set you up for at least 30 minutes on the show tomorrow, alright?
[03:11:33.963 --> 03:11:34.483]  Alright.
[03:11:34.483 --> 03:11:35.263]  Good job, I'll see you.
[03:11:35.263 --> 03:11:36.564]  Alright.
[03:11:36.564 --> 03:11:42.166]  Okay, I apologize to Lindsey Williams for digressing with that, but this is the type of insanity we deal with every day.
[03:11:42.166 --> 03:11:48.749]  Now, speaking of funding ourselves, I've done three hours and eleven minutes and haven't even plugged our sponsors yet that made the show possible.
[03:11:48.749 --> 03:11:50.210]  So I'm going to do that right now.
[03:11:50.210 --> 03:11:52.610]  Then we're going back to Lindsey Williams and then your phone calls.
[03:11:52.610 --> 03:11:53.551]  My solar backup
[03:11:53.991 --> 03:11:56.832]  Have you lost power and wanted to simply flip a switch to get the lights back on?
[03:11:56.832 --> 03:12:03.676]  If so, you should check out MySolarBackup.com because there's never been a better time to start getting off the grid and generate your own supply of electricity.
[03:12:03.676 --> 03:12:04.356]  Here's why.
[03:12:04.356 --> 03:12:08.358]  Plug and play solar generators are available from our wonderful sponsor, Solutions from Science.
[03:12:09.218 --> 03:12:11.839]  The website, again, is MySolarBackup.com.
[03:12:11.839 --> 03:12:15.561]  Unlike gas generators, solar generators run quietly and emit no fumes.
[03:12:15.561 --> 03:12:20.364]  It's like having your own electrical power plant, and it's perfect for your home or your campsite.
[03:12:20.364 --> 03:12:31.449]  Whether it's hurricanes, ice storms, brownouts, or you're worried about the Depression or World War III or all the craziness the Feds are setting up, go to MySolarBackup.com or get a free brochure information package by calling 877-327-0365.
[03:12:31.449 --> 03:12:31.589]  That's 877.
[03:12:35.171 --> 03:12:36.232]  I don't want Will to run with it.
[03:13:05.251 --> 03:13:07.052]  I don't even like having this thing around the office, though.
[03:13:07.052 --> 03:13:07.852]  It fell over it.
[03:13:07.852 --> 03:13:08.673]  I mean, this sucker is.
[03:13:08.673 --> 03:13:10.333]  We need to polish it a bit, though.
[03:13:10.333 --> 03:13:11.174]  Made in Spain.
[03:13:11.174 --> 03:13:13.955]  I mean, this is not one of those cheesy, cheap things.
[03:13:13.955 --> 03:13:17.996]  This is the type of stuff they have at weapons-universe.com.
[03:13:17.996 --> 03:13:19.177]  Here you go, buddy.
[03:13:19.177 --> 03:13:21.058]  Take that monstrosity out of here, please.
[03:13:22.469 --> 03:13:25.152]  I tell you, they've got some amazing stuff.
[03:13:25.152 --> 03:13:29.659]  They've got a lot of practical stuff as well at weapons-universe.com.
[03:13:29.659 --> 03:13:34.586]  They have it all, the best names, the widest selection, weapons-universe.com.
[03:13:34.586 --> 03:13:34.866]  Okay!
[03:13:35.839 --> 03:13:37.660]  I'm going to start taking calls at the bottom of the hour.
[03:13:37.660 --> 03:13:54.146]  I'm going to go to Lindsey Williams now to recap what his major oil company executive intel, who we know the source, this is real intel, it's been very accurate predictions in the past, what he told him about the oil spill two weeks ago and the new developments since then.
[03:13:54.146 --> 03:13:55.587]  Lindsey Williams, go ahead sir.
[03:13:56.533 --> 03:14:12.107]  The Gulf of Mexico oil disaster, the real story of what happened out there, what comes out of the Gulf of Mexico oil gusher, with the oil, this is causing the death of humans and unborn babies.
[03:14:12.107 --> 03:14:18.233]  Yes, I'm concerned about the ecology, I sure am, but I am more concerned about what it's doing to human beings.
[03:14:19.033 --> 03:14:21.557]  Now, let me give a very brief background.
[03:14:21.557 --> 03:14:27.607]  In 1970, the Russians drilled the first, what is known as, super-deep oil well.
[03:14:27.607 --> 03:14:28.869]  They drilled it down to 40,230 feet.
[03:14:28.869 --> 03:14:29.690]  It was called Coal SG-3.
[03:14:33.397 --> 03:14:42.869]  Since then, because of what they found, Russian oil major Stukos has drilled 310 successful deep wells and put them in production.
[03:14:42.869 --> 03:14:48.776]  And last year, Russia overtook Saudi Arabia as the world's biggest single oil producer
[03:14:49.316 --> 03:14:53.400]  And is now set to be the producer for the next century.
[03:14:53.400 --> 03:14:55.762]  What did they find when they got to 40,230 feet?
[03:14:55.762 --> 03:15:00.166]  They did not find fossil fuel.
[03:15:00.166 --> 03:15:04.409]  There are no rotted trees and plants and animals down that deep.
[03:15:04.409 --> 03:15:07.012]  They found abiotic oil.
[03:15:07.012 --> 03:15:08.633]  Please write this down.
[03:15:08.633 --> 03:15:11.395]  A-b-i-o-t-i-c oil.
[03:15:11.395 --> 03:15:16.460]  This is oil that has been formed by a chemical process somewhere in the heart of the Earth.
[03:15:17.308 --> 03:15:22.297]  And as a result of this, Russia has become the oil producer they are.
[03:15:22.297 --> 03:15:30.892]  Now this oil is seeping up into shallow oil wells, such as Saudi Arabia, Nigeria, Mexico,
[03:15:31.892 --> 03:15:35.255]  Many in America, he calls total misnomer.
[03:15:35.255 --> 03:15:51.127]  Now, Russia had sense enough, and I don't hesitate using these words, Russia had sense enough to drill their coal SG-3 well down to 40,000 feet on the land, not in the Gulf of Mexico.
[03:15:51.912 --> 03:15:59.416]  At this point, I contacted the Mr. X in my book, The Energy Non-Crisis, and found out the real story, what has happened.
[03:15:59.416 --> 03:16:10.521]  The difference was BP has attempted to do in the Gulf of Mexico, in water, ocean water, what Russia did on the land.
[03:16:10.521 --> 03:16:13.122]  BP was so stupid,
[03:16:13.700 --> 03:16:14.100]  I think so.
[03:16:29.388 --> 03:16:35.612]  And it was controlled, its position, by very sophisticated GPS equipment.
[03:16:35.612 --> 03:16:40.995]  Now the water at that point, where they attempted to drill, is 5,000 feet deep.
[03:16:40.995 --> 03:16:42.816]  That's approximately one mile.
[03:16:42.816 --> 03:16:43.996]  5,280 feet, one mile.
[03:16:43.996 --> 03:16:46.978]  They drilled 5,000 feet, it was 5,000 feet, to the bottom of the ocean.
[03:16:51.531 --> 03:16:58.659]  And they're drills from that point between 25 and 30,000 feet deep into the ocean.
[03:16:58.659 --> 03:17:00.140]  Now think of it for a moment.
[03:17:00.140 --> 03:17:05.166]  You're flying on that jet aircraft, commercial airliner, cross-country.
[03:17:05.166 --> 03:17:09.551]  You look out the window when the pilot says, we have reached cruising altitude.
[03:17:10.291 --> 03:17:11.352]  And what do you see?
[03:17:11.352 --> 03:17:13.414]  You can hardly see the ground.
[03:17:13.414 --> 03:17:15.896]  Do you realize that's 30,000 feet?
[03:17:15.896 --> 03:17:26.204]  And that's exactly where drilled, they had drilled, they had drilled approximately the depth of what you see from that jet aircraft as you're traveling on a commercial airliner.
[03:17:26.684 --> 03:17:27.865]  It's just preposterous.
[03:17:27.865 --> 03:17:43.554]  Now, I've got to stop here long enough, Alex, to say the government of the United States of America issued the permits to BP to drill that well, and I have not made this statement on any program before, I don't think, but I've come to this conclusion.
[03:17:43.554 --> 03:17:50.458]  The government of the United States of America is just as much to blame for this Gulf of Mexico oil disaster as BP.
[03:17:51.318 --> 03:17:52.759]  They issued the permits.
[03:17:52.759 --> 03:17:55.220]  They gave them the permission to do it.
[03:17:55.220 --> 03:17:56.841]  They knew where they were going.
[03:17:56.841 --> 03:17:58.682]  They knew how deep they were going.
[03:17:58.682 --> 03:18:03.365]  They knew that they could not possibly know what they were going to hit down there.
[03:18:03.365 --> 03:18:09.828]  And when BP got down 25,000 to 30,000 feet... Let me give you the size of the pipe.
[03:18:09.828 --> 03:18:12.469]  You need to know these details as we go along.
[03:18:12.469 --> 03:18:16.992]  This pipe that they were putting into the ocean floor is 20 inches in diameter.
[03:18:17.692 --> 03:18:23.017]  It is two inches thick of solid, hardened steel.
[03:18:23.017 --> 03:18:25.579]  In a moment, I'll tell you what's happening to that pipe.
[03:18:25.579 --> 03:18:27.700]  But right now, let me go back to where we were.
[03:18:27.700 --> 03:18:30.783]  Uh, they hit a strata.
[03:18:30.783 --> 03:18:34.086]  They hit something so catastrophic, so unexpected.
[03:18:34.086 --> 03:18:37.208]  This is positively, is an accident.
[03:18:37.208 --> 03:18:43.273]  Folks, don't, don't for one minute's time say that, uh, that they did this intentionally.
[03:18:43.273 --> 03:18:44.394]  They did not.
[03:18:44.394 --> 03:18:46.736]  Every one of my oil sources, including
[03:18:47.296 --> 03:18:54.401]  The individual whom I've been able to contact with Halliburton, every one of them said this happened by accident.
[03:18:54.401 --> 03:18:56.402]  They did not know what they were hitting.
[03:18:56.402 --> 03:18:58.283]  This is not a conspiracy.
[03:18:58.283 --> 03:19:01.445]  This positively is something that they didn't know they were going to hit.
[03:19:01.445 --> 03:19:03.046]  They hit a strata of oil.
[03:19:03.046 --> 03:19:04.747]  Now notice that word strata.
[03:19:04.747 --> 03:19:08.009]  You're going to hear more of it even in the news as they come out with this.
[03:19:08.009 --> 03:19:11.051]  They hit a strata of oil that was such high pressure.
[03:19:11.631 --> 03:19:12.052]  We're good.
[03:19:25.011 --> 03:19:26.792]  Well, Lindsey, let's stop there.
[03:19:26.792 --> 03:19:27.632]  We've got to go to break.
[03:19:27.632 --> 03:19:29.553]  We're going to come right back to you to continue.
[03:19:29.553 --> 03:19:33.534]  So you're basically recapped what you covered a week ago with us, a week and a half ago.
[03:19:33.534 --> 03:19:39.677]  We're going to continue now with the new developments with Lindsey Williams and then your phone calls.
[03:19:39.677 --> 03:19:42.978]  This just breaking at PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:19:42.978 --> 03:19:44.678]  It's also up on Infowars.com.
[03:19:44.678 --> 03:19:50.861]  Paul Joseph Watson, BP aware of cracks in oil well two months before explosion.
[03:19:51.781 --> 03:19:52.201]  Don't answer it!

[03:20:19.929 --> 03:20:24.212]  Listen, if you're already in debt, does it make sense to get buried in another payment plan?

[03:21:01.032 --> 03:21:03.353]  Good day, Jim Newcomer from Midas Resources.
[03:21:03.353 --> 03:21:03.633]  June 17, 2010.
[03:21:03.633 --> 03:21:04.714]  Gold opened this morning at $1238.40.
[03:21:04.714 --> 03:21:07.755]  A one-ounce gold coin can be purchased for $1271.33, $635.66 for a half-ounce, or $317.83 for the quarter-ounce.
[03:21:07.755 --> 03:21:08.235]  That's $1271.33, $635.66, or $317.83.
[03:21:20.703 --> 03:21:23.567]  Making the right decision is a challenge to investors.
[03:21:23.567 --> 03:21:27.853]  Are we going to see economic growth slide into a recession or worse, depression?
[03:21:27.853 --> 03:21:32.720]  Many investors are turning to gold as a common sense alternative to traditional paper investments.
[03:21:32.720 --> 03:21:36.165]  Midas has put together a powerful book titled 10 Reasons to Own Gold.
[03:21:36.485 --> 03:21:39.127]  Discussing costs, benefits, risks.
[03:21:39.127 --> 03:21:44.270]  The book is free and can be yours by calling 800-686-2237.
[03:21:44.270 --> 03:21:47.711]  Paper investments are dwarfed by gold's 6,000 year history.

[03:21:54.075 --> 03:21:54.235]  Call 800-686-2237.
[03:22:01.298 --> 03:22:03.679]  They helped to create a New World Order.
[03:22:03.679 --> 03:22:05.979]  We are part of a New World Order.
[03:22:05.979 --> 03:22:09.200]  A New World Order based upon collective action.
[03:22:09.200 --> 03:22:14.302]  Invisible Empire is a damning indictment of the globalists through their own words and documents.
[03:22:14.302 --> 03:22:18.503]  The New World Order really is a tool for addressing a new world of possibilities.
[03:22:18.823 --> 03:22:21.166]  It means all the world under their control.
[03:22:21.166 --> 03:22:23.710]  The United Nations would take over America.
[03:22:23.710 --> 03:22:26.974]  The Trilateral Commission would control the world.
[03:22:26.974 --> 03:22:34.564]  Invisible Empire chronicles how men of power and influence have worked in stealth for centuries to establish an oppressive world government.
[03:22:34.904 --> 03:22:40.187]  I believe first of all that we now need nothing short of a world constitution for the global financial system.
[03:22:40.187 --> 03:22:43.148]  Global governance with the establishment of the G20.
[03:22:43.148 --> 03:22:46.830]  So it's going to be an inner ruling elite and then everyone else.
[03:22:46.830 --> 03:22:47.911]  And I got news for you.
[03:22:47.911 --> 03:22:49.252]  You're everyone else.
[03:22:49.252 --> 03:22:50.732]  Invisible Empire.

[03:23:01.460 --> 03:23:05.203]  So you think the massive Gulf oil leak won't affect the air you breathe?
[03:23:05.203 --> 03:23:06.544]  Think again!
[03:23:06.544 --> 03:23:14.191]  Benzene, a toxic gas emitted from crude oil and a known carcinogen, is now airborne traveling hundreds, even thousands of miles inland.
[03:23:14.191 --> 03:23:21.437]  Whether you live near the Gulf or not, benzene and other volatile organic compounds could cause adverse reactions to those living inside your home.
[03:23:21.437 --> 03:23:29.644]  NOAA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, came to airfiltersandpurifiers.com for answers on how to clean the air on boats aiding in the Gulf cleanup.
[03:23:29.964 --> 03:23:31.085]  Do what Noah did.

[03:23:57.663 --> 03:23:59.604]  Your trusted advisor for clean air.
[03:24:05.191 --> 03:24:10.998]  They don't want to see us unite All they want us to do is
[03:24:18.842 --> 03:24:23.005]  Well, I talked to Lindsey during the break and he said this is the number one issue, and I agree.
[03:24:23.005 --> 03:24:30.311]  This is all I hear my neighbors talking about, people on other talk radio shows talking about, and it's like, what is the government going to do?
[03:24:30.311 --> 03:24:31.431]  What is the government going to do?
[03:24:31.431 --> 03:24:38.917]  And their idea is carbon taxes, gas taxes that will fully destroy our economy.
[03:24:39.918 --> 03:24:47.701]  And still the oil well leaks and leaks and leaks and BP's been caught lying from the beginning now into day 67.
[03:24:51.926 --> 03:25:05.597]  This is decimating the Gulf Coast, but then I did read the reports that this oil is full of all sorts of other toxic elements and chemicals and heavy metals, and it is killing dolphins and turtles en masse.
[03:25:05.597 --> 03:25:09.220]  It is just destroying the fishing, the agriculture.
[03:25:09.220 --> 03:25:13.003]  The government's done everything it can to block a good response.
[03:25:13.003 --> 03:25:20.388]  Lindsey Williams continuing, you got to the point of the super, you know, high-powered pressure of this well, which they're now admitting
[03:25:21.449 --> 03:25:32.476]  Yes, Alex, when I was at Pluto Bay as the chaplain to the elite of the world for those three years' time, I watched them bring in many oil wells.
[03:25:33.047 --> 03:25:39.150]  The very first thing they would give as soon as a new oil well was brought in, they would give, and please write these words down.
[03:25:39.150 --> 03:25:41.672]  You want to be correct whenever you say things.
[03:25:41.672 --> 03:25:52.677]  Alex, you'll notice that over the years, the only thing I ever give on any show is what I can prove, document, and never do I go into, I think so, I hope so, or possibly could be.
[03:25:52.677 --> 03:25:53.938]  I stay away from it.
[03:25:53.938 --> 03:25:56.739]  The first thing they would give is the flow rate.
[03:25:56.739 --> 03:25:59.381]  They would check how much oil is coming out of that
[03:25:59.941 --> 03:26:03.004]  A well, how many barrels, for a period of time.
[03:26:03.004 --> 03:26:16.815]  Second thing they would always give, and you have never heard this about the Gulf of Mexico, they always gave the pressure at the well head, please write down the words well head, that's at the top of the pipe, they would take the pressure.
[03:26:16.815 --> 03:26:21.499]  Now the pressure at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska on the average well was 1,500 pounds per square inch, PSI.
[03:26:25.470 --> 03:26:29.572]  The automobile tire on your automobile has 35 pounds per square inch.
[03:26:29.572 --> 03:26:33.515]  Your truck tire on a big tandem tractor trailer will weigh 100 pounds.
[03:26:33.515 --> 03:26:34.415]  Are you ready?
[03:26:34.415 --> 03:26:36.096]  Please write this down.
[03:26:36.096 --> 03:26:49.364]  From my sources, they say that the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster BP's well hit a pressure that human beings have never experienced before on any well they've ever driven.
[03:26:51.606 --> 03:26:53.047]  Russia never hit this.
[03:26:53.047 --> 03:26:55.569]  They hit pressures, but not this kind of pressure.
[03:26:55.569 --> 03:27:03.195]  BP actually hit 20,000 to 70,000 pounds per square inch.
[03:27:03.195 --> 03:27:07.479]  This is beyond human technology to contain it.
[03:27:07.479 --> 03:27:08.380]  It blew everything.
[03:27:08.920 --> 03:27:10.582]  It blew the safety valves.
[03:27:10.582 --> 03:27:12.483]  It blew holes in the pipe.
[03:27:12.483 --> 03:27:13.364]  Oh, please.
[03:27:13.364 --> 03:27:15.026]  You've got... This is a new one.
[03:27:15.026 --> 03:27:18.068]  I'll intersperse these as we go along.
[03:27:18.068 --> 03:27:26.135]  You remember a moment ago, I told you that that pipe that they drilled in the bottom of the ocean was 2 inches thick and 20 inches in diameter.
[03:27:26.135 --> 03:27:27.897]  Solid, hardened steel.
[03:27:28.985 --> 03:27:33.127]  That pipe, right now, is no longer two inches thick.
[03:27:33.127 --> 03:27:35.168]  It is one inch thick.
[03:27:35.168 --> 03:27:36.068]  Let me explain.
[03:27:36.068 --> 03:27:42.291]  Do you remember that BP, back about two, three weeks ago, closed down the Trans-Alaska Oil Pipeline?
[03:27:42.291 --> 03:27:52.015]  Because for 35 years, they've been running oil through it, and it has so diminished the thickness of the pipe, that they were getting leaks everywhere.
[03:27:52.595 --> 03:27:54.756]  This happens over a period of time.
[03:27:54.756 --> 03:28:08.724]  Because of the extreme pressure and the abosive substances that are coming out of this pipe in the Gulf of Mexico, the thickness of the wall of that pipe is no longer two inches.
[03:28:08.724 --> 03:28:11.866]  It is all the way down to one inch now.
[03:28:11.866 --> 03:28:21.051]  And by the time they can plant a nuclear device, an angle drill, and put it in three to four months from now, they say as soon as they could possibly do anything about it,
[03:28:21.551 --> 03:28:31.497]  Meanwhile, there's fissures all over the ocean floor many miles away leaking so there's these fractures and for those that just joined us, BP has now admitted, this is up on PrisonPlanet.com, they were aware of cracks in oil well
[03:28:48.527 --> 03:28:55.212]  Two months before the explosion and that they were giving orders to people on the well that the engineers said were dangerous.
[03:28:55.212 --> 03:28:58.495]  So just very reckless by BP.
[03:28:58.495 --> 03:29:06.080]  Now getting into the toxicity, you say you were on a talk show in Florida and that people were calling in saying they were sick.
[03:29:06.080 --> 03:29:08.743]  We know the workers in Mississippi, Louisiana and Alabama
[03:29:09.918 --> 03:29:10.999]  Are very sick.
[03:29:10.999 --> 03:29:13.442]  BP's tried to make them sign waiver forms.
[03:29:13.442 --> 03:29:21.693]  They're not even giving them the proper breathing apparatus they need because of the type of toxic chemicals that are off-gassing out of this oil.
[03:29:23.877 --> 03:29:26.599]  Yes, that was the most dangerous part.
[03:29:26.599 --> 03:29:31.182]  You know, most people think that the only thing that comes out of an oil well is oil.
[03:29:31.182 --> 03:29:33.063]  No, quite to the contrary.
[03:29:33.063 --> 03:29:40.547]  There are many things that come out, and it depends on the field or the strata that they go into as to what will actually come out of that well.
[03:29:40.547 --> 03:29:43.469]  What is coming out of the well in the Gulf of Mexico?
[03:29:43.469 --> 03:29:45.330]  Now, the oil has kind of a reddish color.
[03:29:45.330 --> 03:29:46.891]  All right, stay there.
[03:29:46.891 --> 03:29:47.652]  Stay there, Lindsey.
[03:29:47.652 --> 03:29:49.353]  Long segment coming up.
[03:29:49.353 --> 03:29:50.874]  We'll get into what's coming out of the well.
[03:29:51.618 --> 03:29:55.541]  We're on the march, the empire's on the run.
[03:29:55.541 --> 03:29:58.223]  Alex Jones and the GCN Radio Network.
[03:30:02.133 --> 03:30:08.578]  The Fall of America and the Western World is an all-new 10-hour documentary and survival guide rolled into one.

[03:31:11.302 --> 03:31:18.685]  My family, staff, friends, and radio listeners are constantly telling me how much they love these products for bath, hair, laundry, and dishes.
[03:31:18.685 --> 03:31:23.567]  There is nothing like these factory-direct, big-money-saving, triple-concentrated soaps anywhere.

[03:31:36.494 --> 03:31:42.638]  As founder and owner for over 63 years, people keep asking me, how's business?
[03:31:43.238 --> 03:31:47.141]  I'm happy to say our business is going down the drain.

[03:33:15.175 --> 03:33:23.581]  I know in the last 20 minutes I've had him recap what he covered with us last week and now he's going to get into the new developments from his sources.
[03:33:24.855 --> 03:33:29.817]  And then I'll also give you my perspective, and we're going to be taking your phone calls here in just a few minutes.
[03:33:29.817 --> 03:33:32.899]  Mark, Andrew, Alan, Grant, James, and others.
[03:33:32.899 --> 03:33:36.700]  The toll-free number to join us on air, dealing with the oil spill and the aftermath, 1-800-259-9231.
[03:33:40.842 --> 03:33:46.526]  But I have seen EPA scientists saying in some areas of the Gulf, there is toxic gases.
[03:33:46.526 --> 03:33:48.407]  You should move out of the area.
[03:33:48.407 --> 03:33:50.829]  We know they have moved National Guard in.
[03:33:50.829 --> 03:33:53.671]  There's been rumors of evacuation.
[03:33:53.671 --> 03:34:03.957]  But Lindsey Williams, you said you've been talking to Gulf radio shows you've been on, and I've been on a few myself, in Florida, in Mississippi, in Louisiana, in Alabama.
[03:34:03.957 --> 03:34:07.480]  And none of the people are saying they're being told to evacuate.
[03:34:07.480 --> 03:34:10.302]  But we saw what happened with Katrina, where they locked down the city.
[03:34:11.122 --> 03:34:11.382]  I think?
[03:34:32.611 --> 03:34:32.871]  I think?
[03:34:51.039 --> 03:35:03.490]  Up on the beaches with the chemicals that it's off-gassing and so that could trigger just a disaster of unprecedented proportions here in North America.
[03:35:03.490 --> 03:35:08.535]  They have had similar things happen in the Gulf and different regions around the Middle East.
[03:35:08.535 --> 03:35:11.437]  It's happened in Indonesia.
[03:35:11.437 --> 03:35:14.941]  So they have had other big oil spills, but this one is starting to rival those.
[03:35:15.781 --> 03:35:23.410]  So continue with the toxicity issue, and then any intel you've got on moves for forced evacuations.
[03:35:23.410 --> 03:35:28.615]  Because, you know, I saw these reports two weeks ago, and I called the towns it was supposedly happening in.
[03:35:28.615 --> 03:35:29.576]  I called hotels.
[03:35:29.576 --> 03:35:30.938]  I called 7-Elevens.
[03:35:30.938 --> 03:35:32.740]  People said, no, there's no troops here.
[03:35:32.740 --> 03:35:35.403]  Now, some areas said there's troops here, but there's no evacuation.
[03:35:35.403 --> 03:35:37.365]  So, Lindsey, continue, and then we're going to go to phone calls.
[03:35:38.171 --> 03:35:46.996]  Well Alex, you mentioned a subject a moment ago that I need to briefly touch on so they'll understand the magnitude of this whole thing.
[03:35:46.996 --> 03:35:54.541]  Senator Bill Nelson appeared on, he's a Democrat from Florida, he appeared on MSNBC with Andrea Mitchell.
[03:35:55.241 --> 03:36:00.286]  On the 9th of June, and he said oil is seeping up from the seabed.
[03:36:00.286 --> 03:36:15.160]  Just after that, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who has been denying that the NBP, both, for all of this time, has been denying that there are any leaks coming out at other places in the ocean.
[03:36:15.160 --> 03:36:17.562]  That means plumes of oil coming up.
[03:36:17.942 --> 03:36:26.388]  That somehow escaped from that pipe because unladenly that big pipe was perforated at the time this humongous amount of pressure hit it.
[03:36:26.388 --> 03:36:28.249]  20 to 70,000 pounds per square inch.
[03:36:28.249 --> 03:36:30.330]  They just admitted to it.
[03:36:30.330 --> 03:36:32.852]  This is by Chris Baltimore from Houston, Texas.
[03:36:32.852 --> 03:36:36.054]  It was on Routers News on June the 8th and they said,
[03:36:36.594 --> 03:36:50.270]  Experts are investigating and report admitting all plumes estimating from the BP's pig-stricken oil well, the Gulf of Mexico, and they say that these plumes are appearing as much as 20 miles away.
[03:36:50.270 --> 03:36:51.171]  Did you catch that?
[03:36:51.611 --> 03:37:03.850]  Folks, do you realize that 25,000 to 30,000 feet down, that big 2-inch thick hardened steel pipe has undoubtedly burst?
[03:37:03.850 --> 03:37:06.493]  And these plumes are working their way out.
[03:37:07.134 --> 03:37:07.395]  Yeah.
[03:37:23.777 --> 03:37:28.402]  And they may have hit a level where it's abiotic, where it's basically unlimited.
[03:37:28.402 --> 03:37:37.751]  We know many of the old oil wells are now filling back up, and more and more petroleum geologists and scientists do believe that it is abiotic, being made in the earth.
[03:37:37.751 --> 03:37:46.460]  You can find some small deposits of the oil as we know it that has particulate from animals in it.
[03:37:46.920 --> 03:37:53.745]  You know, dead prehistoric creatures, fossils, coal that has the imprint of ferns in it.
[03:37:53.745 --> 03:37:59.510]  So we know there is some fossil fuel that is based on dead life and swamps.
[03:37:59.510 --> 03:38:05.794]  But more and more the evidence shows that most oil is abiotic, being produced down in the earth.
[03:38:05.794 --> 03:38:13.921]  And what if they've hit a new strata, and this sucker just keeps pumping for years, then we could have a problem, which is
[03:38:16.118 --> 03:38:21.328]  Alex, Matt Simmons said just this week 25,000 barrels of oil
[03:38:27.169 --> 03:38:28.510]  are being released per day.
[03:38:28.510 --> 03:38:31.352]  Now, he's the first one to come out with a figure this big.
[03:38:31.352 --> 03:38:34.734]  You remember my sources said there were so many gallons per day.
[03:38:34.734 --> 03:38:37.716]  Matt Simmons says it's 25,000 barrels per day.
[03:38:37.716 --> 03:38:54.046]  Now the reason I gave that figure first before I gave the ones about what's coming out with the oil is because you've got to understand the magnitude of the immensity of what's coming out of that well to the point that it comes all the way to the surface in a geyser type thing from
[03:38:54.566 --> 03:38:57.527]  All the way down 5 miles, 5,000 feet.
[03:38:57.527 --> 03:39:05.770]  Now, coming up with that oil, the Environmental Protection Agency just gave these statistics the other day.
[03:39:05.770 --> 03:39:07.511]  I'm going to read them to you.
[03:39:07.511 --> 03:39:09.931]  My goodness, they are so startling.
[03:39:09.931 --> 03:39:13.333]  Coming up with the oil are these gases.
[03:39:13.333 --> 03:39:14.713]  They are toxic.
[03:39:14.713 --> 03:39:16.193]  They are flammable.
[03:39:16.193 --> 03:39:17.454]  If we had a hurricane,
[03:39:17.934 --> 03:39:19.236]  Lord have mercy.
[03:39:19.236 --> 03:39:29.326]  I cannot imagine the respiratory problems and the health problems that are going to develop all the way up the East Coast of America as these gases are taken there.
[03:39:29.326 --> 03:39:39.296]  People are already sick in Florida, as I mentioned from the radio show I was on yesterday in Orlando, Florida, where the talk show host himself said, I've been wanting to throw up for three days.
[03:39:39.296 --> 03:39:40.838]  Now, here they are.
[03:39:41.468 --> 03:39:47.091]  The EPA said that hydrogen sulfide is coming out of that well.
[03:39:47.091 --> 03:39:53.534]  Now I'm going to give you what they allow as the allowable limits for a person to breathe and be safe.
[03:39:54.448 --> 03:39:57.830]  5 to 10 parts per billion.
[03:39:57.830 --> 03:39:59.351]  Please write these letters down.
[03:39:59.351 --> 03:40:02.533]  P-T-E as in boy.
[03:40:02.533 --> 03:40:10.838]  The current tested levels of hydrogen sulfide are 1,200 parts per billion.
[03:40:10.838 --> 03:40:11.839]  This is staggering.
[03:40:12.518 --> 03:40:15.559]  And they aren't telling people about this.
[03:40:15.559 --> 03:40:20.479]  The mothers who are carrying babies, unborn, do you know what this is going to do to them?
[03:40:20.479 --> 03:40:24.840]  Can you have the slightest idea of the health defects that are going to develop from this?
[03:40:24.840 --> 03:40:28.661]  The next one is benzene, and this one really frightens me.
[03:40:28.661 --> 03:40:30.301]  Benzene is toxic.
[03:40:30.301 --> 03:40:32.301]  Benzene is a carcinogen.
[03:40:32.301 --> 03:40:34.642]  Benzene causes cancer.
[03:40:34.642 --> 03:40:40.223]  The safe level... Benzene is so dangerous that the Environmental Protection Agency only allows zero
[03:40:41.798 --> 03:40:42.639]  We're good to go.
[03:40:59.009 --> 03:41:03.833]  Let me give you what the EPA says and what the Associated Press is saying.
[03:41:19.525 --> 03:41:25.449]  Take precautions to move out of the area if impacted by oil spills, says environmental chemist.
[03:41:25.449 --> 03:41:29.532]  Toxins are at 200 times normal levels along the coast.
[03:41:29.532 --> 03:41:35.896]  Now, Lindsey, I want to get into the new info before we go to these calls, because we've got a bunch of calls we've got to get to.
[03:41:35.896 --> 03:41:41.420]  Give us any of the new intel or anything else your source told you or anything else you want to discuss.
[03:41:42.591 --> 03:41:46.474]  Well, first of all, this radio show that I was just on yesterday, unbelievable.
[03:41:46.474 --> 03:41:56.942]  The pipe in the Gulf of Mexico, I think, is very significant in that it has eroded already one inch of its thickness because of the abrasives coming out.
[03:41:56.942 --> 03:42:04.868]  And there will be no pipe there as of three to four months from now, whatever they say, they could plant a nuclear device.
[03:42:04.868 --> 03:42:12.114]  And with all of these other gushers that are coming out at distances up to 20 miles, Alex, I think we have got a
[03:42:12.734 --> 03:42:16.477]  Well, I'm sure Obama will give us a carbon tax that we pay Al Gore, that will fix it.
[03:42:16.477 --> 03:42:19.759]  What do you think of Obama pushing a carbon tax as the supposed solution?
[03:42:38.311 --> 03:42:50.518]  Well, I've been told by some very reliable sources, you know, I have some of them, that the elite positively will use this disaster, even though it's an accident.
[03:42:50.518 --> 03:42:54.300]  They will use it to accomplish their 2010 timeline.
[03:42:54.300 --> 03:42:59.143]  People, please, please, I beg of you, get my documentary.
[03:42:59.143 --> 03:43:01.144]  We just prepared it a few days ago.
[03:43:01.144 --> 03:43:02.965]  Would you please call this number?
[03:43:02.965 --> 03:43:03.545]  The number is 888
[03:43:05.453 --> 03:43:12.922]  799-6111 or go on the web to prophecyclub.com.
[03:43:12.922 --> 03:43:18.769]  P-R-O-P-H-E-C-Y-C-L-U-B dot com.
[03:43:18.769 --> 03:43:21.673]  Our toll free number where the operator is standing by right now.
[03:43:21.673 --> 03:43:21.713]  888-799-6111.
[03:43:25.128 --> 03:43:37.466]  6-1-1-1, the entire story of what the elite plan to do with this, a documentary I just prepared with everything I'm giving here, even the other night on Coast to Coast.
[03:43:37.466 --> 03:43:38.428]  I had two hours.
[03:43:38.428 --> 03:43:40.872]  I only covered maybe half of my materials.
[03:43:41.452 --> 03:43:43.074]  No, I understand.
[03:43:43.074 --> 03:44:07.456]  There's a lot of info, and we're going to give people that phone number and website again one more time, but specifically though, from all of your sources and the radio interviews you're doing, because you told me during a break, Lindsey, the good news is you have not seen any proof that the military is preparing for a forced evacuation of tens of millions of people on the Gulf Coast.
[03:44:08.226 --> 03:44:14.132]  I've talked with a number of people in Florida and the Gulf Coast and I've asked everyone of them the same question.
[03:44:14.132 --> 03:44:16.974]  Do you see any evidence of a forced evacuation?
[03:44:16.974 --> 03:44:23.521]  The talk show host on yesterday along with the callers and there were an entire hour of full lines.
[03:44:23.521 --> 03:44:31.108]  Every single one of them said we have seen no evidence whatsoever so far or even heard any evidence of a forced evacuation.
[03:44:31.568 --> 03:44:34.370]  Okay, listen, we're going to go 20 minutes of overdrive.
[03:44:34.370 --> 03:44:40.654]  It'll be at Infowars.com on the audio streams and for PrisonPlanet.tv viewers, it won't be on the AM and FM.
[03:44:40.654 --> 03:44:45.116]  We've only got about 15 minutes left, right before the show officially ends in 15 minutes.
[03:44:45.116 --> 03:44:49.079]  We'll give out that number and website one more time, but speaking of callers, let's get to them.
[03:44:49.079 --> 03:44:51.060]  Mark in Texas, thanks for holding.
[03:44:51.060 --> 03:44:52.401]  You're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[03:44:52.401 --> 03:44:53.681]  Go ahead.
[03:44:53.681 --> 03:44:55.162]  Hey, thank you.
[03:44:55.162 --> 03:44:57.704]  A couple questions and then I wanted to
[03:44:58.372 --> 03:45:01.426]  See if the people or Lindsey had heard you speak of, Alex.
[03:45:02.168 --> 03:45:14.511]  Well, your son talking about himself reading the Bible, how that might be a help to other people, get a hold of some things and how they deal with stuff, and that Hebrews 9 seemed to be a key to understanding the rest of the Bible.
[03:45:14.511 --> 03:45:22.752]  I read recently, like a family member who dies and he being crucified, I don't think he'd leave without leaving us some detailed instructions.
[03:45:22.752 --> 03:45:27.413]  No, I hear you, Mark, and I appreciate your call, but we just got questions for Lindsey Williams here.
[03:45:27.413 --> 03:45:29.134]  Andrew in Ohio.
[03:45:29.134 --> 03:45:30.094]  Andrew, you're on the air.
[03:45:30.094 --> 03:45:30.514]  Go ahead.
[03:45:31.354 --> 03:45:34.696]  Hi Alex, thank you for taking my call.
[03:45:34.696 --> 03:45:46.384]  I've been researching this for several weeks now, and the Blackstone Group owns the company that makes Quora Exit, which is far, far more toxic.
[03:45:46.384 --> 03:45:57.931]  It's a dispersant that they are putting like a million gallons or so, mixing it with the oil, and they may say that these toxic chemicals are coming out of the well,
[03:45:58.601 --> 03:46:02.384]  But they're the ones that are adding it to the gulf.
[03:46:02.384 --> 03:46:04.326]  And the crop... Well, you know, that's a good point.
[03:46:04.326 --> 03:46:08.350]  Normally we don't see people getting this sick from an oil spill.
[03:46:08.350 --> 03:46:15.116]  There's different variants of crude oil, so it varies from type to type, strata to strata, region to region.
[03:46:15.116 --> 03:46:23.383]  But they are pumping all these admittedly deadly poison dispersants in, so it's a case of the cure being worse than disease.
[03:46:23.383 --> 03:46:23.744]  Go ahead.
[03:46:24.502 --> 03:46:27.744]  Yes, Alex, let me answer his question about CoriExit.
[03:46:27.744 --> 03:46:32.546]  Last week on your program, I had so much material, I never even got to this subject.
[03:46:32.546 --> 03:46:34.487]  I'm so glad that Carla called in about it.
[03:46:34.487 --> 03:46:47.954]  Scientists believe that BP is dumping millions of gallons of CoriExit 9500, a chemical dispersion agent, under the Gulf of Mexico waters to hide the full extent of the leak.
[03:46:48.494 --> 03:46:51.076]  Now estimated to be 2.9 gallons a day.
[03:46:51.076 --> 03:46:55.240]  Well, as you know what Matt Simmons said, much more than that.
[03:46:55.240 --> 03:46:55.480]  Alright.
[03:46:57.947 --> 03:47:03.631]  9,500 is a solvent four times more toxic than oil.
[03:47:03.631 --> 03:47:17.140]  The ancient scientists believe has a 2.61 ppm toxicity level and when mixed with the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, its molecules will be able to phase transition.
[03:47:17.140 --> 03:47:20.983]  The transition involves the change of a liquid into a gaseous state
[03:47:21.303 --> 03:47:21.503]  I think?
[03:47:40.188 --> 03:47:50.876]  And then that'll cause red tides, and that's why they're reporting these big, giant toxic plumes under the surface as well, not just coming out of the other fissures.
[03:47:50.876 --> 03:48:00.023]  So we'll continue to analyze this, but just remember, they're gearing up for war with Iran while we're talking about this, and the bankers are setting up their world government right now.
[03:48:00.023 --> 03:48:01.984]  Boy, this is very convenient timing for them.
[03:48:01.984 --> 03:48:06.788]  I mean, Alex, keep in mind that my employment, now, three 87-year-old gentlemen,
[03:48:07.168 --> 03:48:12.209]  Tell me a year and a half ago that they did not want war with Iran for two years.
[03:48:12.209 --> 03:48:13.710]  That was a year and a half ago.
[03:48:13.710 --> 03:48:17.451]  Alex, we've only got six months, and they have war planned.
[03:48:17.451 --> 03:48:30.154]  You are going to see this escalate now, and they will use this Gulf of Mexico disaster to fit into all of their other plans in order to fulfill their 2012 timeline.
[03:48:30.154 --> 03:48:34.675]  Alright, well, that looks like what it's shaping up for.
[03:48:34.675 --> 03:48:35.655]  Anything else, Andrew?
[03:48:37.005 --> 03:48:44.994]  Sir, it is possible to plug the oil well by putting a pig down the shaft
[03:48:45.894 --> 03:48:51.478]  And using thermite to weld the plug at the deep, farthest end.
[03:48:51.478 --> 03:49:13.374]  Yeah, but how do you put a pig, and for those that don't know, that's one of these little robot systems, how do you have it go into a crushed wellhead and when it's got all that pressure coming out of it, yes they could run a robot up in it and then have it seal it, but how do you do that when you've got all this oil and chemicals gushing around it?
[03:49:13.374 --> 03:49:13.975]  Lindsey Williams.
[03:49:14.693 --> 03:49:17.156]  Well, the pipe is already perforated.
[03:49:17.156 --> 03:49:25.784]  They know because of these plumes that are coming up as much as 20 miles away, which the, you know, AA now is admitting to, and they wouldn't admit to before.
[03:49:25.784 --> 03:49:33.972]  There's no way you can stop this because all you do is just open up that pipe even further down the line somewhere and you still get the plumes out at a distance.
[03:49:33.972 --> 03:49:35.494]  Alright, I appreciate your call.
[03:49:35.494 --> 03:49:36.275]  Anything else, Andrew?
[03:49:38.254 --> 03:49:40.816]  Alright, I want to hear more about that system.
[03:49:40.816 --> 03:49:53.385]  By the way, this is up on PrisonPlanet.com right now, and of course that deals with the fact that the head of BP actually had the article here in front of me.
[03:49:53.385 --> 03:49:57.448]  Let me pull it back up because I can't find it now.
[03:49:57.448 --> 03:49:58.349]  Oh, here it is.
[03:49:58.349 --> 03:50:03.033]  BP aware of cracks in oil well two months before explosion.
[03:50:04.329 --> 03:50:10.193]  Former BP Chairman and current BP CEO both dumped stocks in weeks before a disaster.
[03:50:10.193 --> 03:50:14.237]  BP was aware of cracks appearing in the well as far back as February.
[03:50:14.237 --> 03:50:19.521]  Right around the time, Goldman Sachs and BP Chairman Tony Hayward were busy dumping their stock in the company.
[03:50:19.521 --> 03:50:32.430]  On the eve of the explosion, the lead of the oil spill, according to information uncovered by congressional investigators, the Mining and Mineral Service Agency released documents to Bloomberg indicating that BP was trying to seal cracks in the well almost 40
[03:50:33.231 --> 03:50:35.673]  miles, 64 kilometers, off the Louisiana coast.
[03:50:35.673 --> 03:50:38.414]  This is big news up on PresidentPlanet.com.
[03:50:38.414 --> 03:50:39.155]  This is confirmed.
[03:50:39.155 --> 03:50:40.115]  Bloomberg.
[03:50:40.115 --> 03:50:50.521]  The fissures, which BP began to attempt to fix on February 13th, could have played a role in the disaster, though this is a question still being explored by investigators.
[03:50:50.521 --> 03:50:53.183]  But that would show where the plumes are coming from.
[03:50:53.183 --> 03:50:54.204]  And it just continues.
[03:50:54.204 --> 03:50:55.765]  Very important piece of intel.

[03:52:06.212 --> 03:52:07.473]  Tyranny is here.
[03:52:07.473 --> 03:52:11.156]  The grim future foretold in 1984 has become reality.
[03:52:11.156 --> 03:52:13.639]  It really says that the state is God.
[03:52:13.639 --> 03:52:18.703]  The United States is now recognized globally as one of the most oppressive police states on Earth.
[03:52:19.505 --> 03:52:26.170]  This film conclusively proves the existence of a secret network of FEMA camps, now being expanded nationwide.
[03:52:26.170 --> 03:52:32.135]  This documentary exposes how the continuity of government program has established an all-powerful shadow state.
[03:52:32.135 --> 03:52:36.338]  Police State 4 chronicles the sickening depth to which our Republic has fallen.
[03:52:36.338 --> 03:52:40.622]  Prepare to enter the secretive world of emergency dictatorship.
[03:52:40.622 --> 03:52:43.444]  Body scanners, sound cannons, citizen spies,
[03:52:46.565 --> 03:52:50.126]  It's only the beginning of the New World Order's hellish plan.
[03:52:50.126 --> 03:52:52.087]  The police state isn't coming.
[03:52:52.087 --> 03:52:53.227]  It's here.

[03:53:01.878 --> 03:53:02.459]  Fact.
[03:53:02.459 --> 03:53:03.820]  Four million people in the U.S.
[03:53:03.820 --> 03:53:05.941]  have hepatitis C due to liver damage.
[03:53:05.941 --> 03:53:06.462]  Fact.
[03:53:06.462 --> 03:53:10.144]  Cirrhosis of the liver is the eighth leading cause of death among Americans.
[03:53:10.144 --> 03:53:10.765]  Fact.
[03:53:10.765 --> 03:53:16.269]  Alcohol, many prescription drugs, food additives, pesticides, and environmental toxins damage the liver.
[03:53:16.269 --> 03:53:16.910]  Fact.
[03:53:16.910 --> 03:53:21.113]  One in ten Americans is or has been affected by liver or gallbladder disease.
[03:53:21.113 --> 03:53:21.693]  Fact.
[03:53:21.693 --> 03:53:25.656]  Anything that keeps the liver from doing its job can put your life in danger.

[03:54:18.881 --> 03:54:28.789]  Folks, the only way to listen to the show when it officially ends in about five minutes, we're going to continue for about 20, is at InfoWars.com or PrisonPlanet.com.
[03:54:28.789 --> 03:54:31.852]  You go there, click on the listen stream, you'll be able to hear the show.

[03:54:45.668 --> 03:54:51.195]  And I know we have loaded phones and we are taking calls in the next 20 minutes with Lindsey Williams.
[03:54:51.195 --> 03:54:52.517]  I'm going to be able to go to...
[03:54:54.019 --> 03:55:03.744]  A few of your calls now, but I want to give you an opportunity to call my phone system here in Austin, Texas, 888-201-2244.
[03:55:03.744 --> 03:55:08.826]  For those that are on hold right now, who we don't have time to get to in a moment, it'll be 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244.
[03:55:08.826 --> 03:55:11.947]  We're talking to Lindsey Williams and he put out an emergency
[03:55:16.270 --> 03:55:17.471]  I don't think so.
[03:55:35.592 --> 03:55:37.934]  This is very, very serious.
[03:55:37.934 --> 03:55:44.058]  And Obama's using it to try to pass carbon taxes on the American people, which BP's been the biggest supporter of.
[03:55:44.058 --> 03:55:52.905]  So, I want to encourage everybody to call and get that audio CD, and you can go to the Prophecy Club website or call a toll-free number.
[03:55:52.905 --> 03:55:57.208]  Give folks that contact info again, Mr. Williams.
[03:55:58.038 --> 03:56:03.162]  The toll-free number and the operator standing by right now, American Voices by the way, 888-799-6111.
[03:56:03.162 --> 03:56:06.844]  Or go to Prophecy Club on the internet.
[03:56:06.844 --> 03:56:10.907]  Be sure to spell that with a C. P-R-O-P-H-E-C-Y-C-L-U-B dot com, or 888-799-6111.
[03:56:20.353 --> 03:56:20.673]  799-6111.
[03:56:20.673 --> 03:56:27.596]  Now, we will be updating this documentary probably every two weeks.
[03:56:27.596 --> 03:56:29.557]  Things are happening so rapidly.
[03:56:29.557 --> 03:56:36.400]  And please, I beg of you, my DVDs and CDs are not copywritten, did you hear me?
[03:56:36.400 --> 03:56:37.340]  They are not copywritten.
[03:56:37.340 --> 03:56:37.960]  They are not copywritten.
[03:56:47.629 --> 03:56:48.490]  Uh, hi Alex.
[03:56:48.490 --> 03:57:06.300]  I would like to, uh, I have a question for Lyndon Williams and, uh, I'd like to say that I choose not to believe that 9-11 was not an inside job just because our government says so because it scientifically doesn't seem to make sense that the buildings could have fallen that fast just by being hit by the planes alone.
[03:57:06.300 --> 03:57:16.045]  I also choose not to believe that anyone has ever walked on water or come back to life after being dead for three days because scientifically that's absolutely ridiculous.
[03:57:16.045 --> 03:57:17.266]  I'd also like to add to that that
[03:57:17.845 --> 03:57:24.851]  I used to be a Christian myself and I would recommend everyone listen to this.
[03:57:24.851 --> 03:57:27.153]  I'm going to put you on hold here.
[03:57:27.153 --> 03:57:29.855]  Look, I mean I only do this maybe once or twice a week.
[03:57:29.855 --> 03:57:38.482]  We have a guest on and I say I want to be on topic if you have questions for the guest and then people deliberately, deliberately
[03:57:40.273 --> 03:57:44.176]  Talk about anything but that, and I don't understand it.
[03:57:44.176 --> 03:57:46.678]  So I'm gonna, from now on, I'll let people go.
[03:57:46.678 --> 03:57:52.163]  When we're on a topic, we're having a discussion on a topic, it's insanity.
[03:57:52.163 --> 03:57:53.424]  And you can get mad at me if you want.
[03:57:53.424 --> 03:57:59.729]  I mean, if you called in, Grant, on a regular day when it's just open phones and wanted to say that, that's fine.
[03:57:59.729 --> 03:58:00.910]  We don't screen your calls.
[03:58:00.910 --> 03:58:02.971]  But, I mean, it's ridiculous.
[03:58:03.888 --> 03:58:09.389]  That other callers are left on hold, so you can talk about that.
[03:58:09.389 --> 03:58:19.272]  James Hunter and others, if you want to talk to Lindsey Williams and ask him a question, or make a comment about the oil spill, or you're in Louisiana or Mississippi, Florida, you've got comments.
[03:58:19.272 --> 03:58:23.193]  If you're having respiratory problems, we want to hear from you.
[03:58:23.193 --> 03:58:23.913]  888-201-2244.
[03:58:23.913 --> 03:58:25.213]  We're going into extended
[03:58:27.834 --> 03:58:33.837]  InfoWars.com audio stream and PrisonPlanet.tv video stream coverage of the oil spill.
[03:58:33.837 --> 03:58:35.177]  You want it, you got it.
[03:58:35.177 --> 03:58:38.098]  Lindsey Williams with us into overdrive right now.
[03:58:38.098 --> 03:58:40.099]  Got to tune in to InfoWars.com.
[03:58:40.099 --> 03:58:41.420]  Great job crew, back in one minute.
[03:58:41.420 --> 03:58:46.062]  Copies of the preceding broadcast are available at GCNLive.com or call toll-free 877-376-45.
[03:58:50.950 --> 03:58:55.493]  This is Alex Jones with 5 good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator.
[03:58:55.493 --> 03:58:56.414]  Number 1.
[03:58:56.414 --> 03:58:59.837]  New climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric bill.
[03:58:59.837 --> 03:59:00.697]  Number 2.
[03:59:00.697 --> 03:59:05.581]  Our new energy czar wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have.
[03:59:05.581 --> 03:59:06.321]  It's true.
[03:59:06.321 --> 03:59:11.205]  Total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming.
[03:59:11.205 --> 03:59:12.026]  Number 3.
[03:59:12.026 --> 03:59:15.608]  In some areas of the country, the power grid is dangerously overloaded.
[03:59:15.608 --> 03:59:19.311]  And now, new socialist legislation is only compounding the problem.
[03:59:19.511 --> 03:59:20.311]  Number 4.
[03:59:20.311 --> 03:59:23.072]  Dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids.
[03:59:23.072 --> 03:59:26.753]  Every year, thousands of families lose their power from weather-related outages.
[03:59:26.753 --> 03:59:27.533]  Number 5.
[03:59:27.533 --> 03:59:31.694]  A solar power generator provides powerful backup, insurance, and peace of mind.
[03:59:31.694 --> 03:59:36.736]  Folks, I really believe in the solar power generators offered by Solutions from Science, one of my oldest sponsors.
[03:59:36.736 --> 03:59:40.917]  You can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com.
[03:59:40.917 --> 03:59:42.698]  That's mysolarbackup.com.
[03:59:42.698 --> 03:59:47.299]  Remember, the government doesn't own the sun, so go to mysolarbackup.com or call 1-866-422-9000.
[03:59:47.619 --> 03:59:51.643]  877-327-0365.
[03:59:51.643 --> 03:59:53.184]  Coast to Coast.
[03:59:53.184 --> 03:59:55.246]  Direct from Austin.
[03:59:55.246 --> 03:59:58.449]  You're listening to the Alex Jones Broadcasting Network.
[04:00:16.252 --> 04:00:21.234]  Okay, ladies and gentlemen, we are doing about 20 minutes or so of Overdrive today.
[04:00:21.234 --> 04:00:23.854]  Pastor Lindsey Williams is our guest.
[04:00:23.854 --> 04:00:30.336]  I really appreciate him breaking his intel with us a week and a half ago here on air.
[04:00:30.336 --> 04:00:34.858]  He's in high demand around the country, but back with us today to give us any new developments.
[04:00:34.858 --> 04:00:37.899]  I want to go to Brian, Jerry, Dave, and others that are patiently holding.
[04:00:38.479 --> 04:00:51.088]  If you've got a comment for Lindsay Williams, a question, or you want to talk about the oil spill and Obama's response to it, where you see all this going, 888-201-2244, 888-201-2244, and we'll get you up and on the air.
[04:00:51.088 --> 04:00:58.374]  I also want to just add that your purchase of my documentary films makes this radio broadcast
[04:00:58.854 --> 04:01:00.175]  Possible.
[04:01:00.175 --> 04:01:17.793]  And whether it's Endgame, Blueprint for Global Enslavement, Invisible Empire, New Order Defined, our newest film, so important, Police State 4, The Rise of FEMA, other films we carry like Camp FEMA, Don't Tread on Me, Rise of the Republic, The Fall of the Republic that details the whole banking takeover and the Obama agenda.
[04:01:17.793 --> 04:01:19.976]  Purchasing these videos makes my radio show
[04:01:21.553 --> 04:01:23.055]  And everything we do here possible.
[04:01:23.055 --> 04:01:24.556]  The news websites, everything.
[04:01:24.556 --> 04:01:31.102]  You can also watch all these films at super high quality at PrisonPlanet.tv which is 15 cents a day, $5.95 a month.
[04:01:31.102 --> 04:01:34.426]  You can also share your passcodes with friends and family.
[04:01:34.426 --> 04:01:36.568]  My goal is to get this information out to the people.
[04:01:37.268 --> 04:01:39.649]  And so I want to thank everyone that has supported us.
[04:01:39.649 --> 04:01:43.811]  Go to InfoWars.com to get the high-quality DVDs with expanded extras.
[04:01:43.811 --> 04:01:45.071]  Or you can write to us at P.O.
[04:01:45.071 --> 04:01:49.173]  Box 19549 Austin, Texas 78760.
[04:01:49.173 --> 04:02:00.677]  Or you can call toll-free 888-253-3139 and ask about some of the specials and combos and discounts when you call to get the books, videos, and t-shirts.
[04:02:00.677 --> 04:02:02.458]  Or if you just want to straight-up donate to us,
[04:02:02.938 --> 04:02:06.639]  We could do a lot more if we had more financial support, and I'm not complaining.
[04:02:06.639 --> 04:02:08.440]  We've got incredible financial support.
[04:02:08.440 --> 04:02:23.804]  I can't believe how far we've come, but our audience doubles every year, but the economy is falling apart beneath all our feet, and so your financial support, I see it as a donation when you buy the books and videos, but if you want to flat-out donate to us, it'll go towards the fight against the globalists.
[04:02:23.804 --> 04:02:23.924]  P.O.
[04:02:23.924 --> 04:02:25.825]  Box 19549, Austin, Texas 78760, and I want to thank all of you
[04:02:30.366 --> 04:02:51.391]  For your support, but no one can deny this radio show is having the biggest effect out there of any any alternative media transmission And we try to do the best job we can and we appreciate everybody putting up with us because none of us are perfect But again, we're trying the best we can Lindsay before we go to Brian Jerry Dave Dick and others, please you know any other
[04:02:53.502 --> 04:03:01.044]  Information that you forgot to cover, or what your source told you about the oil spill, or where you see this going.
[04:03:01.044 --> 04:03:04.105]  Anything else you haven't gotten to before we go to calls?
[04:03:04.105 --> 04:03:07.506]  Where I see it going, I think this is very important.
[04:03:07.506 --> 04:03:14.248]  They say that there's no possibility of them doing anything about this for at least four months.
[04:03:14.248 --> 04:03:15.388]  Can you comprehend
[04:03:16.261 --> 04:03:16.902]  I think so.
[04:03:30.246 --> 04:03:34.211]  And they say, in order to do that, there's four months involved in doing it.
[04:03:34.211 --> 04:03:35.934]  And they haven't even started yet.
[04:03:35.934 --> 04:03:42.522]  So this means that you're going to have a continued process of what's taking place right now for at least that period of time.
[04:03:42.522 --> 04:03:46.487]  And then, as my sources originally told me, Stuart,
[04:03:46.727 --> 04:03:52.994]  I mean, I could actually interfere in their voices when they said the only alternative is a nuclear device.
[04:03:52.994 --> 04:03:55.737]  And they said, but we don't like that idea.
[04:03:55.737 --> 04:03:56.858]  I said, why?
[04:03:56.858 --> 04:04:02.564]  They said, because if we fracture this strata that has such tremendous pressure,
[04:04:03.411 --> 04:04:06.292]  And he said there will never be any stopping of it.
[04:04:06.292 --> 04:04:08.753]  And he said, we don't even want to think about that.
[04:04:08.753 --> 04:04:16.175]  Well, neither do I. To never stop this oil from coming out into the Gulf of Mexico, I mean, this is unthinkable.
[04:04:16.175 --> 04:04:20.196]  It would be a disaster such as the world could never even imagine.
[04:04:20.196 --> 04:04:22.957]  All right, secondly, there is no need for any of this.
[04:04:23.735 --> 04:04:25.936]  None of this should have ever happened.
[04:04:25.936 --> 04:04:32.479]  We have on our own soil, in North and South Dakota and Montana, the Bakken Oil Reserve.
[04:04:32.479 --> 04:04:35.300]  It has already been put in the Congressional Record.
[04:04:35.300 --> 04:04:37.341]  The Congressmen know it's there.
[04:04:37.341 --> 04:04:44.504]  And the only thing that is keeping this oil on the land, not in the Gulf of Mexico or in the waters, from being produced
[04:04:45.342 --> 04:04:46.423]  Congress won't let them.
[04:04:46.423 --> 04:04:47.243]  They're crazy.
[04:04:47.243 --> 04:04:49.005]  I mean, it's unbelievable.
[04:04:49.005 --> 04:05:02.855]  It's 8 times as much oil as Saudi Arabia, 18 times as much oil as Iraq, 21 times as much oil as Kuwait, 22 times as much oil as Iran, 500 times as much oil as Yemen.
[04:05:02.855 --> 04:05:05.878]  We have it on our own soil, on the land.
[04:05:05.878 --> 04:05:07.699]  They could begin drilling any day
[04:05:07.939 --> 04:05:08.901]  They want to.
[04:05:08.901 --> 04:05:16.855]  It is not a super deep well and they know that we have a supply and we didn't have to do this in the Gulf of Mexico, Alex.
[04:05:18.803 --> 04:05:33.447]  Well, those are really pertinent points that you make, Lindsey, and it's the type of thing that the media loves because it just goes on every day with new facets and new information.
[04:05:33.447 --> 04:05:46.590]  It becomes a soap opera, but it's a real-world soap opera destroying sea turtles and dolphins and fisheries and fishermen's lives and the people involved in the cleanups are getting sick from the dispersants and the oil.
[04:05:47.851 --> 04:05:57.598]  And you got volcanoes going off in Iceland, shutting down air traffic, and you've got depression, and countries falling, and this quickening, accelerating.
[04:05:57.598 --> 04:06:00.881]  Very, very bizarre to see this unfolding.
[04:06:00.881 --> 04:06:02.382]  Let's hurry now through your calls.
[04:06:02.382 --> 04:06:05.044]  I want to thank everybody for calling in and for holding.
[04:06:05.044 --> 04:06:06.906]  Brian in Ohio, welcome.
[04:06:06.906 --> 04:06:07.526]  You're on the air.
[04:06:07.526 --> 04:06:09.348]  How's it going, Alex?
[04:06:09.348 --> 04:06:09.648]  Good, sir.
[04:06:09.648 --> 04:06:11.930]  Go ahead.
[04:06:11.930 --> 04:06:15.773]  Alex mentioned a few months ago that the elite tell their story through movies.
[04:06:16.924 --> 04:06:25.512]  And supposedly, in the movie The Knowing, that there was a mention of an oil spill, or an explosion, April 20th.
[04:06:25.512 --> 04:06:28.235]  I wonder if there's any correlation with that.
[04:06:29.175 --> 04:06:46.204]  Well, there's a lot of movies and a lot of TV shows where the globalists do predictive programming, where they throw in your face what they're planning to do later as kind of an inside joke to themselves as a calling card, but also to subconsciously prepare you for it to happen.
[04:06:46.204 --> 04:06:57.090]  And there's hundreds of examples, but the best example is the fact that six months before 9-11, the lone gunman, a spinoff of The X-Files,
[04:06:58.030 --> 04:07:04.071]  The CIA contacted Chris Carter and others, and I was told this by Dean Hagelin, star of the show.
[04:07:04.071 --> 04:07:06.612]  He was so concerned about this, he traveled to Austin to speak with me.
[04:07:06.612 --> 04:07:20.495]  So the CIA planted those storylines on them, and he went on to say that, well, I mean, you watch the show, the government hijacks a jet to fly it in the World Trade Center,
[04:07:21.837 --> 04:07:24.961]  To blame it on Afghanistan.
[04:07:24.961 --> 04:07:30.107]  And the government uses a drill, a terror drill, to make the rest of the government stand down.
[04:07:30.107 --> 04:07:33.952]  And that's actually what happened on 9-11.
[04:07:33.952 --> 04:07:35.534]  And so there is something to that.
[04:07:35.534 --> 04:07:36.636]  I appreciate your call.
[04:07:36.636 --> 04:07:37.297]  Anything else, Brian?
[04:07:38.658 --> 04:07:39.319]  Good man, appreciate it.
[04:07:39.319 --> 04:07:39.559]  Thank you.
[04:08:02.243 --> 04:08:05.586]  I didn't hear the last of that because of a dial tone.
[04:08:05.586 --> 04:08:09.850]  Yeah, I think we have a phone system hiccup there, but we'll work on that.
[04:08:09.850 --> 04:08:14.695]  I'm not saying this is what happened, but I know who your oil executive contact is.
[04:08:14.695 --> 04:08:16.237]  You've gotten good intel in the past.
[04:08:16.237 --> 04:08:17.979]  It's turned out to be very accurate.
[04:08:17.979 --> 04:08:22.063]  You said a year before, when oil was $60 a barrel, that it was going to be $150, and that happened.
[04:08:25.506 --> 04:08:28.307]  And of course, Bilderberg Group was saying similar things.
[04:08:28.307 --> 04:08:43.230]  And so these elites go in circles, you know, the same circles, but a lot of times these globalists will give people good info to then later at a key time give them true info but mix some lies in to put out disinfo.
[04:08:43.230 --> 04:08:47.612]  I mean, how does your oil company executive friend know that this wasn't staged?
[04:08:47.612 --> 04:08:53.073]  87-year-old man has cancer, facing the grave.
[04:08:54.256 --> 04:08:58.560]  Uh, he has never told me anything that was wrong over the past 35 years.
[04:08:58.560 --> 04:09:00.921]  I have no choice to believe what he's saying right now.
[04:09:00.921 --> 04:09:06.726]  Uh, Atlantic Ridgefield, former, retired now, saying the same thing.
[04:09:06.726 --> 04:09:13.691]  Um, there's one thing I learned, Alex, when I lived with the elite, and that is they do have a moral code.
[04:09:13.691 --> 04:09:16.853]  It's quite different than the moral code that you and I have.
[04:09:16.853 --> 04:09:22.858]  And one of the facets of their moral code is that they must tell the world everything they're going to do before they do it.
[04:09:24.001 --> 04:09:25.282]  Uh, Katrina?
[04:09:25.282 --> 04:09:30.264]  Yeah, they had an airstorm just a few weeks before it and told you everything they were going to do.
[04:09:30.264 --> 04:09:40.349]  Look, the thing is, the average person does not know how to interpret what these people are saying, but they do tell you ahead of time what they're going to do.
[04:09:40.349 --> 04:09:41.930]  What happened in the Gulf?
[04:09:41.930 --> 04:09:49.913]  There was no ahead of time on this, because this happened by accident, but they are going to use this now to accomplish their 2012 timeline.
[04:09:53.300 --> 04:09:57.261]  All right, let's go back to your phone calls here.
[04:09:57.261 --> 04:10:01.442]  Let's talk with Jerry in Indiana.
[04:10:01.442 --> 04:10:04.003]  You're on the air, Jerry.
[04:10:04.003 --> 04:10:04.723]  Hello, Alex.
[04:10:04.723 --> 04:10:08.884]  I'm a prison plant member for many years and bought two of your videos this week.
[04:10:08.884 --> 04:10:09.504]  Thank you.
[04:10:09.504 --> 04:10:10.464]  Couldn't do it without you.
[04:10:10.464 --> 04:10:16.326]  And we need you more than ever, Alex Jones, right now.
[04:10:16.326 --> 04:10:18.706]  I'm buying the videos, getting them copied.
[04:10:18.706 --> 04:10:20.487]  Lindsey Williams, I bought two of yours.
[04:10:21.505 --> 04:10:29.191]  I can't thank you enough for what you're doing, exposing this fraud and these elitists.
[04:10:29.191 --> 04:10:31.452]  My question is for Lindsey.
[04:10:31.452 --> 04:10:49.285]  Lindsey, the worst case scenario, I know this is going to be hard to answer, but if this, you know, this oil in the Gulf, if it meets up with a major hurricane, and Alex chime in here too, how far north will this oil go?
[04:10:54.342 --> 04:11:11.754]  Well, I'm not a hydrologist, Jerry, and I'm not a meteorologist, but they've said that a hurricane could push this oil 20-30 miles inland up the estuaries, back up the rivers, and that a lot of it could be picked up in the storms and dumped in on the land.
[04:11:11.754 --> 04:11:14.376]  The good news is the oil is biodegradable.
[04:11:14.376 --> 04:11:20.140]  It does have some toxins in it, but there's all these millions of gallons of super-toxic dispersant in it.
[04:11:20.720 --> 04:11:22.542]  That's going to be very destructive.
[04:11:22.542 --> 04:11:24.444]  Jerry, it sounded like your phone was fading out.
[04:11:24.444 --> 04:11:26.285]  Are you still there?
[04:11:26.285 --> 04:11:27.206]  Yes, I'm still here.
[04:11:27.206 --> 04:11:27.987]  Can you hear me?
[04:11:27.987 --> 04:11:29.168]  Yes, I can.
[04:11:29.168 --> 04:11:32.251]  Lindsey Williams, comment on what Jerry was just saying.
[04:11:32.950 --> 04:11:37.613]  Well, it's not the oil itself that has this kind of reddish tint to it that's most concerning to me.
[04:11:37.613 --> 04:11:43.337]  It's what else is coming out of that well in the way of gases, toxic gases.
[04:11:43.337 --> 04:11:43.898]  Well, that's right.
[04:11:43.898 --> 04:11:51.923]  They keep saying it's oil, but I mean oil's... ...all the way up to New York and all the way up to the east coast of the United States of America.
[04:11:51.923 --> 04:11:55.465]  Well, that's right, because it's not just what can be blown in by a hurricane.
[04:11:55.465 --> 04:11:56.246]  They admit that the
[04:11:58.342 --> 04:12:10.306]  The title forces go out of the Gulf around Florida in those channels and travels up the East Coast.
[04:12:13.621 --> 04:12:14.641]  Yes, that's true.
[04:12:14.641 --> 04:12:17.242]  In fact, it's going to devastate the tourist trade.
[04:12:17.242 --> 04:12:25.044]  A talk show host the other day said that a guest had canceled, would not be on his talk show that night.
[04:12:25.044 --> 04:12:26.104]  I said, why?
[04:12:26.104 --> 04:12:30.625]  He said she's a tourist travel agent on the Keys.
[04:12:30.625 --> 04:12:38.227]  When they found out she was going to be on his show, they threatened her and told her not to appear under any circumstances.
[04:12:38.227 --> 04:12:39.907]  She called and canceled out as a guest.
[04:12:40.781 --> 04:12:50.107]  Yeah, this thing is getting to the point that it's going to be... I don't know what the overall effect will have, but it's not going to be pretty.
[04:12:52.619 --> 04:12:54.539]  Well, I appreciate your call, Jerry.
[04:12:54.539 --> 04:12:59.361]  It's a very serious issue, and the word I was looking for was ocean currents.
[04:12:59.361 --> 04:13:01.341]  They know where the currents are going.
[04:13:01.341 --> 04:13:18.386]  You know, the currents sometimes change a little bit, but worldwide, these currents for thousands of years have been very, very accurate, up to the point in the Atlantic, you know, ships knew, you go to this point, you get in this current, and it basically takes you here.
[04:13:18.386 --> 04:13:19.426]  That's why sailing ships
[04:13:20.166 --> 04:13:27.731]  It might take them two weeks to cross the Atlantic, but then it might take them six months to get back across, because they didn't have favorable winds or currents.
[04:13:27.731 --> 04:13:29.332]  And they know where those currents are.
[04:13:29.332 --> 04:13:32.394]  Here's the Gulf of Mexico, if you're watching on PrisonPlanet.tv.
[04:13:32.394 --> 04:13:36.196]  Here's Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Florida.
[04:13:36.196 --> 04:13:42.200]  And the oil spills here off Mississippi, and the currents go down, around the Keys, past Cuba.
[04:13:42.200 --> 04:13:45.582]  I mean, boy, Cuba and the Keys are really gonna get it.
[04:13:45.582 --> 04:13:47.784]  And then, because most of the oil's staying out to sea,
[04:13:49.156 --> 04:14:00.642]  And then it's going to go up, and then the currents come in very close to shore, all the way up the East Coast, up to Canada, and then up towards Greenland and Iceland and England and Northern Europe.
[04:14:00.642 --> 04:14:04.024]  And Northern Europe's going to be hit by this stuff in three or four months.
[04:14:04.024 --> 04:14:12.288]  And if that oil well just keeps going and going and going and going, there's just no telling the type of destruction it's going to cause.
[04:14:13.749 --> 04:14:16.972]  The whole world is going to want the American taxpayer to pay.
[04:14:16.972 --> 04:14:18.193]  You watch!
[04:14:18.193 --> 04:14:20.435]  Even though this is an international company.
[04:14:20.435 --> 04:14:31.444]  That's why it's dangerous to be blaming England for this, because if you can blame a nation, then you can blame a government, rather than blaming these globalist corporations that are literally destroying our national governments.
[04:14:31.444 --> 04:14:34.047]  And I'm not defending our national governments, they're criminal as well.
[04:14:34.047 --> 04:14:37.209]  The point is, these corporations are even more lawless.
[04:14:37.209 --> 04:14:38.650]  Let's talk to Dave in Arizona.
[04:14:38.650 --> 04:14:39.851]  Dave, you're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[04:14:39.851 --> 04:14:40.172]  Go ahead.
[04:14:41.331 --> 04:14:42.051]  Hello, Alex.
[04:14:42.051 --> 04:14:42.891]  Hello, Lindsey.
[04:14:42.891 --> 04:14:43.952]  This is Dave Alcortz.
[04:14:43.952 --> 04:14:46.012]  I listened to you on 12.16.
[04:14:46.012 --> 04:14:47.992]  Lindsey, I have a question.
[04:14:47.992 --> 04:14:52.393]  In reference to the nuclear option, how many devices, how deep would they go?
[04:14:52.393 --> 04:15:00.195]  I assume that the nuclear devices would cause the whole thing to cave in on itself.
[04:15:00.195 --> 04:15:01.575]  Would it cause a tsunami?
[04:15:01.575 --> 04:15:04.416]  How big would the tsunami be, and would there be any fallout?
[04:15:05.958 --> 04:15:08.499]  Some of those things they answered for me, some they did not.
[04:15:08.499 --> 04:15:13.141]  They merely said that they would angle drill down into the depth of the ocean.
[04:15:13.141 --> 04:15:20.004]  Now understand, you've got 5,000 foot water here that they're going to have to start with before they can even do that angle drilling.
[04:15:20.004 --> 04:15:32.029]  Then when they angle drill down, they would go down, I don't know, they did not say how deep, and plant this nuclear device and it would actually, what should I say, solidify the soil.
[04:15:32.649 --> 04:15:34.230]  Does that answer your question?
[04:16:00.583 --> 04:16:01.844]  Okay, I guess it does.
[04:16:01.844 --> 04:16:03.365]  Up next is Dave in Arizona.
[04:16:03.365 --> 04:16:04.966]  Dave, you're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[04:16:04.966 --> 04:16:06.667]  Go ahead.
[04:16:06.667 --> 04:16:07.688]  Yeah.
[04:16:07.688 --> 04:16:08.669]  Oh, it's Dick in Nevada.
[04:16:08.669 --> 04:16:09.449]  I already went to Dave.
[04:16:09.449 --> 04:16:11.030]  Go ahead, Dick.
[04:16:11.030 --> 04:16:12.371]  Yeah, hello.
[04:16:12.371 --> 04:16:14.193]  Good to talk to you guys.
[04:16:14.193 --> 04:16:15.393]  I'm kind of curious.
[04:16:15.393 --> 04:16:26.882]  You know, they started talking about this hooded thing and trying to capture and save some of this a couple months ago and the use of other countries and ships.
[04:16:26.882 --> 04:16:30.244]  They could recover some of this stuff if they wanted to make an attempt at it.
[04:16:31.201 --> 04:16:35.682]  Sure seems like they're using this as a convenient crisis.
[04:16:35.682 --> 04:16:43.944]  Probably going to sacrifice BP in the process, but in order to get this cap and trade or whatever attacks are going to jam on us.
[04:16:43.944 --> 04:16:56.007]  But with that hooded thing, it seems we likely would be able to pressurize and separate and save some of that oil, plus be able to probably burn off the other gases and the poisonous stuff.
[04:16:56.007 --> 04:16:58.508]  Well, they admit now that they are going to create
[04:17:00.450 --> 04:17:01.916]  A flare to burn off.
[04:17:01.916 --> 04:17:04.726]  They were saying 10% of it and they say they've got a hood over it.
[04:17:05.612 --> 04:17:07.333]  That's getting some of the oil.
[04:17:07.333 --> 04:17:16.218]  There's just so much oil that it's basically trying to bail out a swimming pool using a teacup.
[04:17:16.218 --> 04:17:21.640]  And the swimming pool is always being refilled as you're there with a teacup trying to capture it.
[04:17:21.640 --> 04:17:27.504]  I mean, engineering-wise, though, it looks like it is a serious obstacle.
[04:17:27.504 --> 04:17:30.245]  And expanding on that, they did block the states.
[04:17:30.245 --> 04:17:33.567]  Lindsey, what's your take on that, how they block the states
[04:17:34.227 --> 04:17:49.174]  One weekend, the states were wanting to go block their estuaries and protect the fisheries, protect the key areas in Louisiana and Mississippi, and the feds did come in and say, no, wait for our response, and did everything they could to block the response.
[04:17:49.174 --> 04:17:52.395]  Is that so there's a bigger disaster and the feds get more power?
[04:17:52.395 --> 04:17:55.076]  Because we saw the same thing with Katrina.
[04:17:55.076 --> 04:17:55.997]  What's your view on that?
[04:17:56.735 --> 04:18:01.517]  Well, it's unbelievable that the federal government can override the state governments like this.
[04:18:01.517 --> 04:18:04.919]  State rights are being completely disregarded.
[04:18:04.919 --> 04:18:06.500]  And I think it's an atrocity.
[04:18:06.500 --> 04:18:11.402]  Every single politician up there should be thrown out, and we've got to start all over again.
[04:18:11.402 --> 04:18:17.525]  Our agencies have become little Hitlers, and we're not even allowing states to do anything.
[04:18:17.525 --> 04:18:19.366]  I think it's an atrocity.
[04:18:19.366 --> 04:18:20.967]  It is all about power.
[04:18:20.967 --> 04:18:22.248]  I appreciate the call, Dick.
[04:18:22.248 --> 04:18:22.748]  Anything else?
[04:18:24.740 --> 04:18:31.892]  We need to get these corporate monopolies busted up and back to companies that are responsible and not be regionalized.
[04:18:31.892 --> 04:18:34.396]  Why do we got BP out in the Gulf and running our...
[04:18:35.339 --> 04:18:37.379]  A line of Alaskan stuff.
[04:18:37.379 --> 04:18:41.040]  Well, notice it's BP whose symbol is the green flower.
[04:18:41.040 --> 04:18:46.161]  They're the ones always pushing the environmental tyranny, and I think they're behind it.
[04:18:46.161 --> 04:18:49.821]  I mean, they gave orders that they knew were going to cause an explosion.
[04:18:49.821 --> 04:18:54.202]  Their oil company workers are on record saying, we knew this was going to happen.
[04:18:54.202 --> 04:18:58.223]  And they can say, well, we didn't do it on purpose.
[04:18:58.223 --> 04:19:03.184]  But they knew, drilling enough of these super deep wells, that if they did this in an unconventional
[04:19:04.744 --> 04:19:06.766]  Hey Alex, first time to talk to you.
[04:19:06.766 --> 04:19:09.127]  You're an honorable guy, doing a good job here.
[04:19:09.127 --> 04:19:11.829]  I'm sort of an inventor, so I kind of have a lot of
[04:19:31.627 --> 04:19:59.257]  understanding mechanics and stuff like that and I remember I listened to these guys they had an interview on them from CNN and these guys had survived the blast or whatever and they asked them what did it sound like and one of the guys said it sounded like the tale of the beast or the devil the dragon himself now I'm not putting anything biblical into this but what I'm saying is he said this was a seasoned oil guy he said he never
[04:19:59.761 --> 04:20:00.562]  He was on the rig.
[04:20:00.562 --> 04:20:03.004]  He never heard anything like this in his life.
[04:20:03.004 --> 04:20:09.851]  He said, it was like, it was like the pit of hell was coming out of that thing when it was burning.
[04:20:09.851 --> 04:20:16.778]  So, uh, I know at three that you think this well, the pastor, you think this well was, he said it was 25,000 feet down.
[04:20:19.437 --> 04:20:22.999]  Yeah, this well is 5,000 feet in the ocean.
[04:20:22.999 --> 04:20:30.563]  Then when they began at the ocean floor, they went between 25,000 and 30,000 feet when they hit this strata of oil.
[04:20:30.563 --> 04:20:45.491]  But the reason this gentleman heard things like that that's never been heard before, because from all the sources that I can talk with, there has never been a well hit on the face of the Earth that had between 20,000 and 70,000 pounds per square inch of pressure.
[04:20:45.491 --> 04:20:48.793]  This caused an explosion such as has probably never been heard before.
[04:20:49.253 --> 04:20:54.778]  Well, Lindsey, I like your analogy of being in a jet airplane at 33,000 feet.
[04:20:54.778 --> 04:20:59.121]  This well is 30,000 feet under the ocean floor, 5,000 feet of water above it.
[04:20:59.121 --> 04:21:07.188]  So that's a greater distance from being up in a jumbo jet looking down on mountains that look like little mole hills.
[04:21:07.188 --> 04:21:14.494]  I mean, that is in a deep oil well, and they're finding incredibly high-pressured oil and gas.
[04:21:16.092 --> 04:21:19.493]  Twenty-five, thirty thousand feet down below the earth.
[04:21:19.493 --> 04:21:27.095]  I mean, there are so many mysteries of this world, and who knows what they're going to tap into one day, drilling into the earth.
[04:21:27.095 --> 04:21:29.296]  I mean, man knows so little.
[04:21:29.296 --> 04:21:39.078]  And look at this disaster, and think about all the nanotech, the genetic engineering, the cross-species manipulations, all of the disasters they've had.
[04:21:39.078 --> 04:21:41.799]  The Hadron Super Collider over in CERN.
[04:21:42.299 --> 04:21:52.746]  Switzerland, where their own scientists say, yeah, there's a small chance it could make a black hole, or a singularity, or a strangelet, and could destroy the Earth.
[04:21:52.746 --> 04:22:00.430]  I mean, it's a recklessness, and this just gives us an idea of bigger disasters to come.
[04:22:01.691 --> 04:22:22.408]  As man's common sense doesn't match up to the incredible knowledge we've now gained, but not just the knowledge, the playing around in a fireworks factory with a flamethrower, not knowing what we're going to hit, what we're going to catch on fire, it seems like a ticking time bomb.
[04:22:23.342 --> 04:22:26.425]  This is a super deep well.
[04:22:26.425 --> 04:22:29.428]  Please understand what BP has done here.
[04:22:29.428 --> 04:22:40.338]  They were copying the Russians, because they knew that they could become the leader of oil production in the world, next to Russia itself, if they accomplish this super deep well.
[04:22:40.338 --> 04:22:45.624]  They are treading into areas that humankind has never treaded into before.
[04:22:45.624 --> 04:22:47.205]  And the Russians, of course, too.
[04:22:48.592 --> 04:22:55.671]  And of course the Russians two weeks ago released a film footage of them using a hydrogen bomb to put out one of these super deep wells on land.
[04:22:57.119 --> 04:23:00.140]  So, I mean, it's one thing to put one out on land using a nuke.
[04:23:00.140 --> 04:23:03.661]  It's another thing to do it in the ocean, when you've already got all these fissures.
[04:23:03.661 --> 04:23:09.582]  This will probably just blow a bigger hole, and now you'll have a whole bunch of other strata of oil coming up out of it.
[04:23:09.582 --> 04:23:11.323]  And then BP will get what it wants.
[04:23:11.323 --> 04:23:12.583]  It'll get its carbon tax.
[04:23:12.583 --> 04:23:15.584]  Then, they've already said they're going to create a subsidiary of BP.
[04:23:15.584 --> 04:23:21.005]  This company will be allowed to implode, and the money, like Enron, will move on to the next operation.
[04:23:21.005 --> 04:23:22.406]  Let's talk to David in Oregon.
[04:23:22.406 --> 04:23:23.726]  David, you're on the air with Lindsey Williams.
[04:23:23.726 --> 04:23:24.026]  Go ahead.
[04:23:25.605 --> 04:23:26.446]  Thank you.
[04:23:26.446 --> 04:23:42.277]  I appreciate it Alex and by the way my wife and I appreciate you very very much My question to you is and to Lindsay is as far as the oil well Is concerned you know the?
[04:23:42.277 --> 04:23:45.479]  The live BP broadcast that they have on the internet.
[04:23:45.479 --> 04:23:50.062]  Yes is that is that in fact of the oil of the oil well head and
[04:23:52.216 --> 04:23:53.016]  They say it is.
[04:23:53.016 --> 04:23:54.257]  They're such incredible liars.
[04:23:54.257 --> 04:23:55.157]  Who knows?
[04:23:55.157 --> 04:23:56.037]  Lindsey?
[04:23:56.037 --> 04:23:57.317]  That's right.
[04:23:57.317 --> 04:23:59.158]  I agree exactly with what you said.
[04:23:59.158 --> 04:24:04.499]  You cannot depend on anything they say.
[04:24:04.499 --> 04:24:07.340]  But I think the answer is, we don't know.
[04:24:07.340 --> 04:24:08.180]  Sir, anything else?
[04:24:08.180 --> 04:24:21.424]  The reason why I was asking was because I helped put the fires out in Kuwait and the oil well fires that we had over there, of course, were considerably different.
[04:24:22.202 --> 04:24:41.739]  But I was looking at this plumage coming off this head and I found it interesting that if it was, I wanted the distinction, when they broke the well, when the well was first came in, was that when it got the 70,000 pounds pressure or up to that?
[04:24:41.739 --> 04:24:45.282]  Or are they saying that it's 70,000 pounds of pressure now?
[04:24:45.282 --> 04:24:49.126]  And the reason why I'm asking is because if you look at the pictures on the video,
[04:24:49.696 --> 04:24:54.659]  You can see that there is all kinds of material floating around in the water.
[04:24:54.659 --> 04:25:05.206]  If it was 70,000 pound psi of oil pressure that was actually coming out of that head, there would be so much turbulence, the ROVs couldn't be around that.
[04:25:05.206 --> 04:25:08.668]  And you can see that the stuff floating around in the water
[04:25:09.105 --> 04:25:12.630]  Is just lightly going into the plume and coming out.
[04:25:12.630 --> 04:25:19.780]  Well that's the point I wanted to say and I'm really glad we're taking your calls on this and stay there because I want you to have a counterpoint.
[04:25:20.936 --> 04:25:45.925]  I'm no expert, but I know it's under 5,000 feet of water, so it's under incredible pressure, and that might cause something coming out at a higher pressure to at least look like it was moving slower, but I don't understand all the hydrology, so I'm just, you know, speculating here, but this is a question I'm going to expand on tomorrow, and we'll open the phones up, because it doesn't look like it's coming out with that much pressure.
[04:25:45.925 --> 04:25:46.365]  It's just kind of...
[04:25:47.694 --> 04:25:52.115]  You know, coming out like it's 500 pounds of pressure.
[04:25:52.115 --> 04:25:58.217]  I mean, we've all seen water coming out of a water drain and if you put black dye in it, it would look about like this.
[04:25:58.217 --> 04:26:06.680]  It doesn't look like it's these tens of thousands of barrels a day.
[04:26:06.680 --> 04:26:11.362]  So that's a really good point and I've sat there so many times and watched the live
[04:26:12.262 --> 04:26:33.076]  Well head cam and it just doesn't look like it's that much oil and I'm not saying versus what Lindsay source says tens of thousands of pounds of pressure or what the mainstream media is saying now that it's 60 plus million gallons or whatever day 60 something I mean it's all estimations.
[04:26:33.076 --> 04:26:35.038]  Lindsay your comments on that it's a really good question.
[04:26:35.538 --> 04:26:40.040]  Yeah, I did have an oil man that responded to this.
[04:26:40.040 --> 04:26:45.422]  I have not mentioned it before because I didn't, you know, I think so.
[04:26:45.422 --> 04:26:48.003]  This oil man said to me, he said, I've watched those pictures.
[04:26:48.003 --> 04:26:51.324]  Now, he's not with BP, another oil company.
[04:26:51.324 --> 04:26:55.126]  He said, I have watched those pictures and he said they don't make any sense.
[04:26:55.126 --> 04:26:59.967]  He said, I can't believe that this was really the pictures of what's happening down there at that wellhead.
[04:26:59.967 --> 04:27:01.048]  That was his response.
[04:27:02.665 --> 04:27:06.368]  And notice how the media is providing this video for us.
[04:27:06.368 --> 04:27:08.669]  Anything else, Caller?
[04:27:08.669 --> 04:27:12.092]  Yeah, I'd like to say one more thing.
[04:27:12.092 --> 04:27:25.741]  Noticing, okay, the video, by the way, which just went off the air, but noticing in the video that the ROVs are moving around freely with free motion, floating at will and so forth, positioning themselves at different points around the well.
[04:27:25.741 --> 04:27:28.623]  There's no turbulence to speak of that you can see in the area.
[04:27:29.215 --> 04:27:39.277]  The stuff is coming out as we just spoke about, but what's even more interesting is that understanding that this well is at 4,900 feet, so it's almost a mile down.
[04:27:39.277 --> 04:27:48.838]  Considering the differential, 70,000 pounds PSI would give you about 25,000 to 35,000 pounds PSI worth of differential.
[04:27:48.838 --> 04:27:54.179]  And even at that depth, you'd have turbulence beyond your imagination, and I don't see anything like this.
[04:27:54.179 --> 04:27:57.880]  So what I'm seeing here is a lie, and I am an engineer.
[04:27:58.808 --> 04:28:02.751]  This stuff here is, um, stuff I've been doing for many, many years.
[04:28:02.751 --> 04:28:13.898]  I gave Boots and Coots and Redditor, uh, uh, uh, the technology to put out the fires that you saw in Kuwait using the, uh, hydro tube with the nitrogen shower nozzle and the jet engines with the, uh, half tracks back in 1990.
[04:28:15.393 --> 04:28:21.677]  This stuff that I'm seeing, Alex, is a lie, and I think that the American people are being spoofed on this.
[04:28:21.677 --> 04:28:22.718]  That's all I have to say.
[04:28:22.718 --> 04:28:24.559]  Well, David, don't hang up.
[04:28:24.559 --> 04:28:26.140]  I mean, I believe you sound very credible.
[04:28:26.140 --> 04:28:29.042]  I'd like to have you on as a guest.
[04:28:29.042 --> 04:28:41.090]  If you want to not use your name, just send us some basic credentials, and then we can make up whatever name you like, as long as I know that you are an engineer who's worked with petroleum, because these are the type of guests that I do want to get on
[04:28:41.690 --> 04:28:42.030]  I don't
[04:28:59.892 --> 04:29:17.226]  PSI for what they claim is coming out and then visually calibrate that to the lack of turbulence that we see in these live webcam videos and that is a major story and needs to be looked at.
[04:29:17.226 --> 04:29:21.850]  So can I put you on hold and get your number and decide if you want to come on the show?
[04:29:24.258 --> 04:29:25.459]  We're happy to Alex.
[04:29:25.459 --> 04:29:36.924]  Okay guys, will you, Matt, will you get his number please and ask him if he wants to give us his full name or if he wants to just send us some credentials.
[04:29:36.924 --> 04:29:39.985]  But let's not forget about this because I want to get him on.
[04:29:39.985 --> 04:29:46.088]  In fact, I want to get some petroleum engineers on who can analyze this and not just read what they're saying in the newspapers.
[04:29:46.088 --> 04:29:52.530]  And if petroleum engineers are scared of being punished or persecuted by the oil industry, email us at
[04:29:55.194 --> 04:30:13.584]  Showtips at Infowars.com and send us documentation of your name and who you really are and we'll hold that in confidence and you can come on and we can call you Mr. X, Mr. Y, Mr. C, Mr. A, whatever you like or make up a fake name for you as long as I know you're a real source because we're going to continue to cover this
[04:30:14.144 --> 04:30:15.925]  We're going to cover it more and more.
[04:30:15.925 --> 04:30:18.025]  I've just seen a lot of oil spills.
[04:30:18.025 --> 04:30:20.126]  I know they're not normally that big of a deal.
[04:30:20.126 --> 04:30:26.888]  They hurt some of the people affected, but the geopolitical overall system, it's not that big of an issue.
[04:30:26.888 --> 04:30:33.991]  But the fact that this just continues and continues, and now they want their carbon tax, and now these companies dump their stock, and all this happened.
[04:30:33.991 --> 04:30:37.232]  We've been covering it since it happened, but I'm going to be covering it a lot more here.
[04:30:37.972 --> 04:30:40.293]  While we cover other important news.
[04:30:40.293 --> 04:30:45.094]  But that was an amazing phone call from David in Oregon, wasn't it Pastor?
[04:30:45.094 --> 04:30:45.874]  Very much so.
[04:30:45.874 --> 04:30:51.656]  In fact, I would love to hear his synopsis of all of this.
[04:30:51.656 --> 04:30:54.717]  Definitely, that would make for a fascinating program, Alex.
[04:30:54.717 --> 04:30:57.797]  Well, we need to just do the calculation because it changes every day.
[04:30:57.797 --> 04:31:00.038]  It seems to be doubling every week.
[04:31:00.038 --> 04:31:06.480]  Lindsey, do you have the numbers on what they claim, what they guesstimate is coming out of that well a day right now?
[04:31:07.864 --> 04:31:11.866]  Well, um, let's see, yes I do.
[04:31:11.866 --> 04:31:14.488]  Matt Simmons says 25,000 barrels a day.
[04:31:14.488 --> 04:31:17.230]  Now my sources did not say that.
[04:31:17.230 --> 04:31:24.514]  My sources said there was somewhere in the neighborhood of, let me go back through my notes here real quick, they didn't give anything near that.
[04:31:24.514 --> 04:31:28.256]  Um, I'll find them here in a moment.
[04:31:28.256 --> 04:31:30.838]  They told me though at the time, they said we're being very conservative.
[04:31:31.634 --> 04:31:36.018]  They said we can't afford to estimate more than what's there.
[04:31:36.018 --> 04:31:37.679]  I know, but let's make the calculation.
[04:31:37.679 --> 04:31:40.221]  If they say it's... I'm looking here real fast to try to find it.
[04:31:40.221 --> 04:31:44.004]  Well, I mean, they're saying 20,000 pounds of pressure.
[04:31:44.004 --> 04:31:46.366]  20,000 gallons.
[04:31:46.366 --> 04:31:48.027]  Wait a minute.
[04:31:48.027 --> 04:31:53.872]  Okay, they said, the Mr. X in my book said 4 million gallons a day.
[04:31:56.509 --> 04:32:00.032]  He said that's very conservative.
[04:32:00.032 --> 04:32:03.975]  He said, I'm taking what we know to be the bottom of the totem pole.
[04:32:03.975 --> 04:32:05.656]  52 gallons to a barrel.
[04:32:17.509 --> 04:32:19.611]  But Matt Simmons says a whole lot more than that as of this past week.
[04:32:19.611 --> 04:32:19.671]  No.
[04:32:19.671 --> 04:32:20.051]  It is not.
[04:32:20.051 --> 04:32:24.936]  And one oil man has already questioned that with me and said that he couldn't believe what he's seeing on that webcam.
[04:32:37.233 --> 04:32:39.234]  Who knows, it's probably a Pentagon production.
[04:32:39.234 --> 04:32:48.116]  I mean, the CIA admitted two weeks ago they create fake Bin Laden videos, and then they bragged and said, we put fake videos on the news to manipulate you.
[04:32:48.116 --> 04:32:49.276]  I mean, who knows?
[04:32:49.276 --> 04:32:50.837]  It could be an Easter Bunny.
[04:32:50.837 --> 04:32:53.938]  I mean, that's the problem with these liars.
[04:32:53.938 --> 04:32:57.038]  Three more callers, we're gonna let Lindsey go, we appreciate all his time.
[04:32:57.038 --> 04:32:58.799]  David in New Jersey, you're on the air.
[04:32:58.799 --> 04:33:02.420]  Hey Alex, hey Lindsey, how you doing?
[04:33:02.420 --> 04:33:02.940]  Good, go ahead.
[04:33:04.392 --> 04:33:06.074]  I have two questions.
[04:33:06.074 --> 04:33:15.983]  My first one was, I was listening to George Norrie on YouTube, and he had this guest on, I don't know his name, but he was saying about like this gas bubble forming
[04:33:16.818 --> 04:33:24.647]  Around the oil well and that like if it explodes or like another explosion happens, I could cause a tsunami.
[04:33:24.647 --> 04:33:27.350]  I just wanted to know if you knew anything about that.
[04:33:27.350 --> 04:33:31.856]  Well, I mean, they did have declassified documents for the Australian, British and U.S.
[04:33:31.856 --> 04:33:33.438]  governments in the fifties.
[04:33:33.438 --> 04:33:34.899]  Looked at tsunami bombs.
[04:33:35.580 --> 04:33:48.708]  Where they could detonate bombs, A-bombs or hydrogen weapons, and cause a tsunami and then cover up that it was a nuke, but that was never used, they claim.
[04:33:48.708 --> 04:33:56.512]  But I have to say that to claim that a oil well explosion underwater would be one
[04:33:58.194 --> 04:34:06.081]  You know, fraction of a thousandth of a, you know, even low yield, you know, say five megaton hydrogen bomb.
[04:34:06.081 --> 04:34:08.443]  I think that sounds pretty ridiculous, but who knows?
[04:34:08.443 --> 04:34:13.127]  Because people tend to get twisted what is said on talk shows and what aren't.
[04:34:13.127 --> 04:34:20.274]  I asked Lindsey Williams earlier, I should have brought this up during a break, I said, what did you say about who really controls the military?
[04:34:21.363 --> 04:34:24.285]  And that the American people would be shocked if they knew who really controlled it.
[04:34:24.285 --> 04:34:26.427]  And he said, no, I never said that on that show.
[04:34:26.427 --> 04:34:29.449]  And so people may have heard a caller or something.
[04:34:29.449 --> 04:34:32.511]  But what about tsunamis?
[04:34:32.511 --> 04:34:33.852]  Do you have any comments on that, Lindsey?
[04:34:35.329 --> 04:34:36.270]  Uh, not really.
[04:34:36.270 --> 04:34:38.971]  I have heard the same rumor that you've heard.
[04:34:38.971 --> 04:34:42.012]  But there again, I go back to what I said earlier in the program.
[04:34:42.012 --> 04:34:47.195]  I cannot operate on thinks so, hopes so, hears so.
[04:34:47.195 --> 04:34:52.097]  I have to go to my informants to find it and none of them have indicated this to be the case.
[04:34:52.097 --> 04:34:55.218]  I have heard about this big bubble that's down there.
[04:34:55.218 --> 04:34:56.139]  I hope it's not so.
[04:34:57.921 --> 04:35:04.824]  Alright, let's go ahead and take a few final phone calls here in this marathon transmission.
[04:35:04.824 --> 04:35:08.786]  Jeff in Texas, you're on the air.
[04:35:08.786 --> 04:35:15.849]  Hi, I had heard when you said that this was a strata of oil?
[04:35:15.849 --> 04:35:23.733]  That's correct, that's what they called it was a strata of oil that they went into that they undoubtedly have never penetrated before.
[04:35:25.014 --> 04:35:34.285]  So my question is kind of like in a hydraulic system where heated pressurized oil holds, the force holds something up.
[04:35:34.285 --> 04:35:40.312]  Since they're depressurizing this strata, can we expect to see earthquakes?
[04:35:41.074 --> 04:36:07.003]  uh... in the outer rims of the strata well when you understand the magnitude of the size of the planet uh... you know oil wells uh... taking tens of millions of gallons of oil out from very deep it is negligible compared to the overall structure and you've got all these different strata you know natural gas is is in domes or can even be in sand and then comes out of the rock
[04:36:07.523 --> 04:36:11.046]  And so you're in areas that are actually what you would think of as solid sand or rock.
[04:36:11.046 --> 04:36:13.108]  I'm no engineer, but I've read about it.
[04:36:13.108 --> 04:36:21.235]  You've got oil wells that are shallower that have caused sinkholes to start, sinkholes to form.
[04:36:21.235 --> 04:36:23.757]  So there is some evidence of that.
[04:36:23.757 --> 04:36:25.959]  The Israelis admit that they've looked at
[04:36:27.040 --> 04:36:30.521]  Yeah, there's got to be something taking place down there.
[04:36:51.896 --> 04:36:59.182]  You know, there again, it's all supposition as far as I'm concerned because I haven't heard my sources say this.
[04:36:59.182 --> 04:37:03.306]  But, you know, this could cause no telling what.
[04:37:03.306 --> 04:37:06.608]  We just have to wait and see, really.
[04:37:06.608 --> 04:37:07.249]  Absolutely.
[04:37:07.249 --> 04:37:09.851]  Caller, does that answer your question?
[04:37:09.851 --> 04:37:10.832]  Yes, it does.
[04:37:10.832 --> 04:37:11.613]  Thank you very much.
[04:37:11.613 --> 04:37:12.233]  Thank you, Jeff.
[04:37:12.233 --> 04:37:12.954]  I appreciate it.
[04:37:14.062 --> 04:37:26.656]  And again, we can get engineers on here, we can get scientists on, we can get geologists, hydrologists, they're not going to know all the answers because the world is so complex and they're drilling at depths.
[04:37:26.656 --> 04:37:34.784]  I mean, if I got a geologist on who say had worked in a certain area of say Limestone County, Texas, and he'd worked there for 20 years drilling
[04:37:35.979 --> 04:37:38.482]  Shallow and deep wells.
[04:37:38.482 --> 04:37:41.485]  And I asked them questions about that area.
[04:37:41.485 --> 04:37:46.089]  They could tell me with a lot of authority what was going on and what would probably happen.
[04:37:46.089 --> 04:37:54.538]  But you start getting people out there that are drilling 30,000 feet under the ocean floor, they don't know what's going on.
[04:37:54.538 --> 04:37:56.139]  They don't understand it.
[04:37:56.139 --> 04:37:59.643]  They're learning as they go along and that's what's so scary about this, Lindsey.
[04:38:00.553 --> 04:38:02.275]  He has hit the unknown.
[04:38:02.275 --> 04:38:04.537]  Literally.
[04:38:04.537 --> 04:38:05.679]  Just think about it for a moment.
[04:38:05.679 --> 04:38:13.026]  Even Russia, in their super deep wells to 40,230 feet, they did not hit this oil pressure.
[04:38:13.026 --> 04:38:14.868]  This is the unknown.
[04:38:14.868 --> 04:38:17.231]  They don't know what to take of it.
[04:38:17.231 --> 04:38:19.814]  And a lot of even they themselves are guessing.
[04:38:21.380 --> 04:38:23.602]  Well, I just want to say this before we take a final call.
[04:38:23.602 --> 04:38:25.183]  I am humbled by all the listeners.
[04:38:25.183 --> 04:38:27.104]  I'm humbled by everyone's support.
[04:38:27.104 --> 04:38:38.271]  I'm humbled by people calling in and asking me questions because somebody asked me about the Federal Reserve or the Second Amendment or the New World Order or Queen Beatrix or the Bilderberg Group.
[04:38:38.271 --> 04:38:40.032]  I can, you know, comment on that.
[04:38:40.032 --> 04:38:45.176]  And I actually have done a little bit of study in oil wells and hydrology and drilling.
[04:38:45.176 --> 04:38:48.818]  But, you know, again, the government doesn't know.
[04:38:48.818 --> 04:38:49.859]  BP doesn't know.
[04:38:51.580 --> 04:38:55.661]  All they know how to do is put new taxes on us and take more of our freedoms.
[04:38:55.661 --> 04:38:58.782]  And now Hillary Clinton's on the Drudge Report.
[04:38:58.782 --> 04:39:03.024]  Obama administration to sue Arizona over immigration law.
[04:39:03.024 --> 04:39:06.285]  So, more treason on that front.
[04:39:06.285 --> 04:39:09.085]  Let's take one final call and let Lindsey Williams go.
[04:39:09.085 --> 04:39:10.786]  George in Connecticut, you're on the air.
[04:39:12.168 --> 04:39:13.108]  Hi, Lindsey.
[04:39:13.108 --> 04:39:15.069]  I have three quick questions.
[04:39:15.069 --> 04:39:26.452]  One, with some of the secret technology that we have, drilling tunnels through the United States for trains or whatever they talk about on various other shows, why can't they use something like that?
[04:39:26.452 --> 04:39:31.494]  The other question is, is there any way we can stop these people with their carbon tax?
[04:39:31.494 --> 04:39:37.016]  What ways can we sabotage their plans for 2010 or whatever date they have?
[04:39:37.016 --> 04:39:40.517]  And lastly, this seems suicidal because the Chinese are waiting on the side.
[04:39:40.517 --> 04:39:41.837]  I've lived in Asia for a long time.
[04:39:42.236 --> 04:39:48.701]  And they're just waiting for us to knock ourselves off so they can just pick up the pieces while we're flat on our back.
[04:39:48.701 --> 04:39:57.148]  And if these idiots pull off this plan, basically they're going to just pounce on us after we jackassed ourselves into a corner.
[04:39:57.148 --> 04:40:03.773]  Well, it is true the world's a very serious, dangerous place and the elites we have are out of control and arrogant.
[04:40:03.773 --> 04:40:09.157]  And some of it was declassified in the fifties that they had nuclear-powered giant
[04:40:10.481 --> 04:40:39.466]  underground tunneling machines uh... that could uh... you know in some cases what i read was tunnel up to a half mile a day depending on what type of rock they're going through but normally they drill those tunnels just a few hundred feet under the ground they're all over austin they're out of the old bergstrom because it was the former sack command base they go out to fort hood uh... there are underground bases and and uh... that's part of the continuity of government program uh... most of it's secret but we know the program exists
[04:40:40.246 --> 04:40:40.486]  I don't
[04:41:00.683 --> 04:41:05.166]  Just like there's pressure involved with water on top of you, there's pressure when you're underground.
[04:41:05.166 --> 04:41:28.101]  I mean, they've got mile-deep mines in South Africa, I've seen film footage of, where it's 150 degrees, and they've got giant air conditioners they lower down, and even with those huge air conditioners that move with the miners, mining diamonds and gold, it's still 115 degrees, and they've got to stand right in front of the air conditioner, with it 150 degrees, five feet away from them.
[04:41:28.701 --> 04:41:31.983]  Hacking out giant diamonds and gold.
[04:41:31.983 --> 04:41:35.405]  I mean, so again, man is not all powerful.
[04:41:35.405 --> 04:41:36.385]  Man is not God.
[04:41:36.385 --> 04:41:38.887]  We can barely go a mile down to get diamonds.
[04:41:38.887 --> 04:41:40.888]  Lindsey Williams.
[04:41:40.888 --> 04:41:48.992]  Nothing is going to stop the elitist timeline of 2012 except the providence of God.
[04:41:48.992 --> 04:41:54.035]  I highly recommend you call on him on a regular basis and ask for his assistance.
[04:41:54.804 --> 04:42:04.294]  Well, I also highly recommend people get your DVD set, breaking down all this, and the latest audio CD, and give that toll-free number and website out again one more time.
[04:42:04.294 --> 04:42:04.895]  Lindsey Williams.
[04:42:04.895 --> 04:42:08.339]  Toll-free numbers operator standing by right now.
[04:42:08.339 --> 04:42:11.502]  Please copy these documentaries and give them out.
[04:42:11.502 --> 04:42:12.783]  They are not copywritten.
[04:42:12.783 --> 04:42:14.145]  My toll-free number is 888.
[04:42:16.340 --> 04:42:20.142]  799-6111 or go on the web to ProphecyClub.com.
[04:42:20.142 --> 04:42:21.742]  That's P-R-O-P-H-E-C-Y-C-L-U-B.com.
[04:42:32.563 --> 04:42:33.504]  I like that.
[04:42:33.504 --> 04:42:43.388]  I don't oftentimes say things to you too much because you and I, all of us are in this business together, but I have such a great admiration for what you're doing.
[04:42:43.388 --> 04:42:45.249]  I appreciate you immensely.
[04:42:45.249 --> 04:42:50.932]  You are reaching audiences that nobody else in America is reaching in a way that nobody else is doing it.
[04:42:51.392 --> 04:42:56.120]  And I just say, God bless you, the real God, the true and living God of the Bible.
[04:42:56.120 --> 04:42:59.566]  And keep up the great work you're doing, and I have a great admiration for you.
[04:42:59.566 --> 04:43:04.134]  And everybody out there, you listen to Alex Jones every day, and don't you miss a single program.
[04:43:04.929 --> 04:43:07.770]  Lindsay, I appreciate what you're doing as well and God bless you.
[04:43:07.770 --> 04:43:20.274]  We're all trying to reach people together and just to question the system and try to somehow prepare ourselves as this world gets crazier and crazier and we can't do it without God and you're absolutely right at the end of the day to put it at God's feet.
[04:43:20.274 --> 04:43:28.797]  As long as we do the right thing and just count on God, I know I have faith that God will come through for us as a civilization, as a society.
[04:43:28.797 --> 04:43:30.878]  We'll talk to you again next week with another update.
[04:43:30.878 --> 04:43:32.538]  Lindsay Williams, thank you.
[04:43:32.538 --> 04:43:33.079]  Thank you, Alex.
[04:43:33.079 --> 04:43:33.679]  Have a great day.
[04:43:34.079 --> 04:43:35.000]  You bet.
[04:43:35.000 --> 04:43:36.440]  I said I'd do 20 minutes of overdrive.
[04:43:36.440 --> 04:43:37.941]  We did 44 minutes of overdrive.
[04:43:37.941 --> 04:43:45.165]  I want to say great job to my crew, to the Genesis Network, to the folks that make InfoWars.com and PrisonPlanet.com possible.
[04:43:45.165 --> 04:43:47.446]  I'll be back live tomorrow, 11 a.m.
[04:43:47.446 --> 04:43:51.749]  Central, at InfoWars.com and on your local AM and FM dial.
[04:43:52.964 --> 04:44:03.748]  Whatever we do, we know a carbon tax and more taxes on the American people and our faltering industry is not going to fix this problem in the Gulf, and so we have that fight to deal with.
[04:44:03.748 --> 04:44:06.029]  Until next time, sayonara.
[04:44:06.029 --> 04:44:07.149]  Alex Jones, signing off.
[04:44:21.600 --> 04:44:22.841]  I think so.
