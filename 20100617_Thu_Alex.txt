[00:41.520 --> 00:45.880]  two of the interview we started last week with Lindsay Williams is coming up
[00:45.880 --> 00:52.360]  today due to listener request in the fourth hour we're also going to be
[00:52.360 --> 00:56.200]  talking to a man and I've got the charges here in my little hands from
[00:56.200 --> 01:00.480]  we are change LA who I know well who I've interviewed before who supplied us
[01:00.480 --> 01:08.240]  with powerful video Bruno was in a court hearing trial and smiled and then
[01:08.240 --> 01:14.960]  frowned the judge said so he's facing terrorism charges and the police man
[01:14.960 --> 01:18.560]  handled him out in the a four year and then charging with assaulting him this
[01:18.560 --> 01:23.080]  is a standard operating procedure now he's gonna be popping in for about 30
[01:23.080 --> 01:27.200]  minutes as soon to be political prisoner he'll be popping in for about 30
[01:27.200 --> 01:33.040]  minutes in the middle of the third hour today we are change at Los Angeles this
[01:33.040 --> 01:36.740]  could happen anybody you've all seen the countless videos there was one that made
[01:36.740 --> 01:43.720]  national news a few months ago in Maryland where you've got some college
[01:43.720 --> 01:46.840]  students out walking and police and riot year come up and beat them have to
[01:46.840 --> 01:52.120]  death and then charge them with assaulting them and the the teenagers
[01:52.120 --> 01:58.800]  the college students I think one was 19 almost 20 didn't even raise their arms
[01:58.800 --> 02:03.720]  now raising your arm to block a baton is basically a weapon of mass destruction
[02:03.720 --> 02:09.680]  terror attack now kind of like the Atari militias dear rifles were weapons of
[02:09.680 --> 02:15.880]  mass destruction will now basically raising your arm is a WMD and is just
[02:15.880 --> 02:20.080]  an act of high treason but even if you don't raise your arm even if you stick
[02:20.080 --> 02:24.280]  your chin out and say break my jaw for no reason you are the state you are
[02:24.280 --> 02:29.560]  government you are God raise my taxes rape me take everything I've got you are
[02:29.560 --> 02:40.000]  still charged with assaulting a God fucking Ghostbusters when Zool says are you a
[02:40.000 --> 02:51.120]  God and they say no then die are you a government employee oh well actually no
[02:51.120 --> 03:00.240]  then die everything is ours government is growing like cancer racing
[03:00.240 --> 03:08.680]  metastasizing to the body nothing could stop it all right I'm gonna try to
[03:08.680 --> 03:14.000]  settle down ladies and gentlemen excuse me well I watched Chris Matthews slime
[03:14.000 --> 03:18.400]  ball special last night and I've got a big list of notes here I want to comment
[03:18.400 --> 03:22.760]  on that I wrote while I was watching and here at the office working on a new
[03:22.760 --> 03:31.120]  film late we had dinner while we watched it in the coffee room and greedily ate
[03:31.120 --> 03:40.240]  some frozen pizzas like good little slaves all the rest of our money goes
[03:40.240 --> 03:46.040]  to taxes we appreciate the sun shining the grass growing the birds tweeting
[03:46.040 --> 03:50.400]  thanks to government but I didn't watch Matthews slime ball and it was the script
[03:50.400 --> 03:54.640]  the script we got was the script a week and a half ago that was used in the
[03:54.640 --> 03:58.720]  television program except that they did cut some of it and I'm actually glad
[03:58.720 --> 04:04.880]  that they cut most of me out of the television show I'm pleased because it's
[04:04.880 --> 04:08.520]  not the type of face time I'm looking for with a tiny network with half a
[04:08.520 --> 04:14.000]  million viewers when he's a high almost highly rated programs like
[04:14.000 --> 04:19.160]  slime ball these one of their top shows who half a million overnight that
[04:19.160 --> 04:24.520]  network has about 20,000 people watching you can go pull up the numbers from
[04:24.520 --> 04:29.800]  Nielsen and look at it for yourself a small local talk station has more
[04:29.800 --> 04:35.840]  viewers than the MSNBC on many days but I'm glad that they actually cut me out I
[04:35.840 --> 04:39.080]  guess they realized they were a little too libel doing it the part where they
[04:39.080 --> 04:43.280]  go Jones isn't calling for violence but his supporters are probably about to
[04:43.280 --> 04:49.000]  shoot cops any minute and that's what Jones is causing Jones he's linked to
[04:49.000 --> 04:55.200]  cop killing that was cut out and some other stuff so thank you MSNBC you did
[04:55.200 --> 04:59.400]  retract a bit of your script I wonder if it being leaked cause that to happen
[04:59.400 --> 05:02.840]  this is Alex Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a
[05:02.840 --> 05:07.160]  solar power generator number one new climate legislation could easily double
[05:07.160 --> 05:11.320]  or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are wants to control
[05:11.320 --> 05:15.360]  how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true total
[05:15.360 --> 05:19.240]  government control of electricity in the name of smart grid technology is
[05:19.240 --> 05:23.520]  coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously
[05:23.520 --> 05:27.680]  overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only compounding the
[05:27.680 --> 05:31.960]  problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every
[05:31.960 --> 05:35.680]  year thousands of families lose their power from weather related onages number
[05:35.680 --> 05:39.880]  five a solar power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of

[09:48.200 --> 09:52.240]  way or the other they put all these fake news statistics about oh right at half
[09:52.240 --> 10:00.040]  the American people pay no tax baloney baloney you get paid less because your

[10:39.280 --> 10:45.440]  of pension fund money put it in a hedge fund invest it and supposedly take the
[10:45.440 --> 10:49.520]  profits it's kind of like a lottery oh you get five million dollars over the
[10:49.520 --> 10:59.280]  next 30 years paid out in payments it's the same thing and the media left-wing
[10:59.280 --> 11:01.840]  right-wing it doesn't matter the controlled media is saying this is the
[11:01.840 --> 11:09.160]  biggest issue in world history they're saying it's revelations warmwood and the
[11:09.160 --> 11:13.960]  ocean turned to blood and a third of the creatures in it died and everyone's
[11:13.960 --> 11:18.360]  running around quoting revelations it's the end it's the end they've had oil
[11:18.360 --> 11:22.680]  spills in the Middle East three times bigger than this they've had old spills
[11:22.680 --> 11:28.080]  in Indonesia twice as large as this three years ago they had one as big as
[11:28.080 --> 11:36.760]  this in the Gulf of Mexico off the coast of Mexico and it wasn't an issue oh it
[11:36.760 --> 11:40.560]  hurt some of the fishing it hurt some of the locals but Mexico didn't even ban
[11:40.560 --> 11:45.080]  their people fishing it crude oil is not that toxic compared to the chemicals
[11:45.080 --> 11:50.680]  they're using to disperse it crude oil is highly biodegradable is it gonna kill
[11:50.680 --> 11:54.840]  some manatees which I like those sea cows they're cute little sweet creatures
[11:54.840 --> 12:00.480]  re-entrance yes it's it's too bad is it killing a lot of dolphins yes but you go
[12:00.480 --> 12:08.080]  down to the Gulf Coast dolphins are like mullet or hard heads I mean they're
[12:08.080 --> 12:13.720]  just everywhere by the way to talk about how ignorant people are three or four
[12:13.720 --> 12:18.760]  months ago I was down at the beach and I was walking at night I'd gone for a
[12:18.760 --> 12:22.560]  jog at sunset and I was coming back and some yuppies were coming out of their
[12:22.560 --> 12:27.200]  beach house we're actually beach house condominiums and I was walking to the
[12:27.200 --> 12:32.200]  dark and I was walking to the dark about 10 feet from them being domesticated
[12:32.200 --> 12:36.400]  they were scared and they said oh they said oh my gosh you snuck up on us and
[12:36.400 --> 12:41.440]  trying to pick pocket us and I said and I laughed and they said no I'm serious
[12:41.440 --> 12:45.200]  see there's they're scared of everything but big tyrannical government and I
[12:45.200 --> 12:49.120]  try to make small talk I said no I was going for a jog I'm going over back over
[12:49.120 --> 12:53.360]  here to the beach house we've rented they went oh and you know it was like
[12:53.360 --> 12:57.560]  three yuppie guys and three yuppie ladies and I thought they were joking and
[12:57.560 --> 13:01.160]  then they were kind of bowing up and I was literally 10 feet from them in the
[13:01.160 --> 13:05.760]  dark by the beach and there were cars driving by and stuff and I didn't
[13:05.760 --> 13:09.160]  understand I guess because they had an adrenaline rush seeing me in the dark they
[13:09.160 --> 13:14.760]  decided I must be bad and you know I was wearing jogging shoes jogging shorts
[13:14.760 --> 13:22.120]  jogging shirt and I said hey you want to go down to the jetty it was about a
[13:22.120 --> 13:25.760]  mile and a half away I said to the bunch of green sea turtles down there in
[13:25.760 --> 13:30.480]  dolphins and the woman laughed she said there's no dolphins in these waters it's
[13:30.480 --> 13:35.800]  too hot I guess she thought whales and or only in the Atlantic or only in
[13:35.800 --> 13:43.040]  northern clines they'll know there's equatorial mammals whales dolphins
[13:43.040 --> 13:46.560]  subgroup of whales I say I don't know why I'm digressing I just had a flash
[13:46.560 --> 13:52.560]  back to this I didn't argue with her I shut up and just because I've stopped
[13:52.560 --> 13:55.400]  running I'd you know it was about a hundred yards to the beach house so I
[13:55.400 --> 13:58.840]  started walking and I just kind of put my head down I started walking and heard
[13:58.840 --> 14:03.920]  the men making powerful grunting noises they had driven off the enemy see
[14:03.920 --> 14:10.560]  there's all these facsimiles are all these shadows of men and shadows of
[14:10.560 --> 14:16.960]  women guys will bow up to somebody who walks up to the curse light area at the
[14:16.960 --> 14:20.640]  grocery store and if some guy kind of butts in front of him to get the curse
[14:20.640 --> 14:26.040]  light he might have a word with him or if somebody's walking through the dark
[14:26.040 --> 14:31.520]  after sunset on the beach people get scared they'll bow up or a gal sit there
[14:31.520 --> 14:38.120]  with his Harley Davidson revving at looking at the the weak guy driving the
[14:38.120 --> 14:42.040]  minivan next to him and he'll stare at him and with a powerful look on his face
[14:42.040 --> 14:46.840]  and let him know that he's wearing his biker jacket and you better watch it
[14:46.840 --> 14:51.560]  little man I'm not bashing people who like biker jackets and Harleys I like
[14:51.560 --> 14:57.160]  Harleys and and then I think the biker culture is cool and I understand it but
[14:57.160 --> 15:03.320]  the point is that's not your manhood your manhood is being aware and being
[15:03.320 --> 15:09.920]  involved and not being scared of guns and not being scared of freedom and not
[15:09.920 --> 15:13.840]  being scared of property rights and not being scared of national sovereignty
[15:13.840 --> 15:17.000]  and not being scared of political correctness to the point of you won't
[15:17.000 --> 15:25.160]  speak up and get involved that's what's important that's what's patriotic not
[15:25.160 --> 15:35.760]  acting cool all day but the point is the Gulf Coast is just filled with big old
[15:35.760 --> 15:41.120]  green sea turtles and dolphins you can go down there to say Port Aransas and
[15:41.120 --> 15:45.840]  stand any time of day on the jetties and there are just dolphins everywhere
[15:45.840 --> 15:51.360]  everywhere to the point of they're so overpopulated it's destroying the
[15:51.360 --> 15:55.920]  fishing in the area because the dolphins are just gobbling everything up so it's
[15:55.920 --> 16:06.000]  a terrible thing that this oil is out there but it is a distraction it is a
[16:06.000 --> 16:13.800]  distraction it is a diversion from the fact that the UN is set to vote on
[16:13.800 --> 16:22.040]  crippling sanctions that will include an embargo a blockade of Iran and goods
[16:22.040 --> 16:26.240]  coming into the country non-military which is under every charter
[16:26.240 --> 16:32.400]  historically and under current law an act of war and Iran is saying they will
[16:32.400 --> 16:37.560]  start boarding international ships which will be an act of war and it is off to
[16:37.560 --> 16:44.040]  the races World War three is in preparation publicly right now with
[16:44.040 --> 16:52.520]  Iran and this will not go like Afghanistan and Iraq and we've got a
[16:52.520 --> 16:57.040]  public so timid that if you try to talk to most of your neighbors they don't
[16:57.040 --> 17:00.160]  want to talk to you because they want to go in and watch Sports Center or they
[17:00.160 --> 17:03.480]  want to go in and take their Prozac or drink their beer or live in their own
[17:03.480 --> 17:08.320]  little world we live in a country that's so strange that Americans are
[17:08.320 --> 17:13.160]  scared on the beach at night and will not talk to fellow citizens about
[17:13.160 --> 17:18.680]  dolphins and turtles and think it's weird if you try to talk to them back
[17:18.680 --> 17:24.800]  when they talk to you we live in a country so in its comfort zone that the
[17:24.800 --> 17:38.080]  average American is scared of a gun this is not the spirit this is not the
[17:38.080 --> 17:44.960]  attitude that is going to save the country a timid crouch down and lick the
[17:44.960 --> 17:50.040]  hand that feeds you forget that you are our countrymen we need to be angry
[17:50.040 --> 17:53.360]  that's what the media always says oh don't criticize anything the government's
[17:53.360 --> 17:56.920]  doing don't criticize all the communist rallies going on around the country
[17:56.920 --> 18:02.000]  funded by the government don't criticize that or you must be a racist
[18:02.000 --> 18:13.280]  that's meant to make you sit down and shut up you're meant to be timid you're
[18:13.280 --> 18:18.760]  meant to be cowardly you're meant to be scared to talk about anything but what
[18:18.760 --> 18:23.760]  is acceptable and what does the media say is acceptable you're allowed to talk
[18:23.760 --> 18:30.920]  about sports and you're allowed to talk about the weather and I catch myself
[18:30.920 --> 18:34.080]  even doing it if somebody tries trying to talk to me at the park and they go
[18:34.080 --> 18:40.720]  past the weather I don't want to talk to them because usually I'm already
[18:40.720 --> 18:44.360]  thinking about something and we're so busy in our daily lives and there's so
[18:44.360 --> 18:49.960]  much going on in our minds that that we just want to do what's safe but I tell
[18:49.960 --> 18:56.680]  you more and more I break my conditioning I was in a CVS pharmacy
[18:56.680 --> 19:03.320]  driving home Sunday and I go up to the counter and the woman starts pushing
[19:03.320 --> 19:08.000]  flu shots on me now I know full well that it was a hoax from the beginning and
[19:08.000 --> 19:12.680]  now it's admitted it was a hoax I know full well that for two months even the
[19:12.680 --> 19:16.520]  government said there's no need to take the shot anymore because the H1N1
[19:16.520 --> 19:22.760]  non-event pandemic the hoax is over but the woman said would you like an H1N1
[19:22.760 --> 19:26.160]  shot we have specials on them getting rid of their inventory of course and I
[19:26.160 --> 19:29.800]  didn't go through that speech whether I said no thank you do you want a CVS card
[19:29.800 --> 19:33.040]  and I said no thank you you're pushing a tracking card and then she said do you
[19:33.040 --> 19:37.080]  want to give money to Lou Gehrig's disease a dollar and I said no thank you
[19:37.080 --> 19:40.640]  and she gave me a condescending look and smacked her lips and I said listen lady
[19:40.640 --> 19:45.880]  I said that H1N1 shot you want to push on me is linked to Lou Gehrig's disease
[19:45.880 --> 19:49.080]  and Guillain berets and she rolled her eyes and I said with my son standing
[19:49.080 --> 19:53.440]  right next to me I said it's on the insert it causes neurological disorders
[19:53.440 --> 20:00.000]  don't smack your lips at me and I raised my voice and then I started preaching at her

[25:16.040 --> 25:21.520]  prosecutors want gag order on blagojevich defense lawyers say Chicago
[25:21.520 --> 25:27.400]  Tribune well of course they do it's on record that he worked with Rahm Emanuel
[25:27.400 --> 25:35.520]  that he came up under Axelrod as one of the protege's of Axelrod Axelrod is
[25:35.520 --> 25:42.000]  their kingpin and then of course above them is mob boss daily I mean Chicago
[25:42.000 --> 25:47.600]  no one debates that Chicago's full of great people and great pizza but at the
[25:47.600 --> 25:52.960]  same time it is mafia center USA it you don't get any more corrupt than the big
[25:52.960 --> 25:58.880]  city machine and it's time to kick it out and the bigger they are the harder
[25:58.880 --> 26:04.120]  they fall it's on record of course we reported this year and a half ago when
[26:04.120 --> 26:10.800]  Obama won the presidency but now it's mainline news that for years as a
[26:10.800 --> 26:18.800]  congressman and then of course as a senator both senator Obama and house
[26:18.800 --> 26:29.840]  member Rahm Emanuel had their homes paid for not just in Chicago but in DC by
[26:29.840 --> 26:36.480]  companies like well one of them big lobbyists for BP they paid for the
[26:36.480 --> 26:43.520]  house for years the million dollar plus a year apartment condo of the White
[26:43.520 --> 26:48.680]  House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel and then of course Goldman Sachs and others
[26:48.680 --> 26:57.120]  paying for things for Obama I mean that is illegal on its face on its face it is
[26:57.120 --> 27:01.080]  illegal they should be indicted right now but don't forget who they've got as
[27:01.080 --> 27:04.400]  the attorney general he was the deputy attorney general under hair Clinton and
[27:04.400 --> 27:13.400]  the butcher of Waco Janet Reno and Janet Reno who on record was blackmailing
[27:13.400 --> 27:17.600]  Clinton the entire time with all of his crimes was able to basically get away
[27:17.600 --> 27:23.240]  with murder including murder at Waco but government involvement in the murder
[27:23.240 --> 27:31.280]  not suicide of Vince Foster this is a mafia crew they enjoy heist they enjoy
[27:31.280 --> 27:39.360]  bravada they enjoy hubris they enjoy the bold moves and so Blagojevic has been
[27:39.360 --> 27:43.160]  trying to get all the tapes released the government's like no no no because on
[27:43.160 --> 27:49.200]  those tapes is Axelrod and Emanuel and Barry Sitaro and all of them and it's
[27:49.200 --> 27:53.640]  on record that they're in the tapes how do you think this works this is
[27:53.640 --> 28:01.600]  Chicago and Goldman Sachs and others said hey we love this model we want a
[28:01.600 --> 28:07.560]  Chicago crew you know these guys will get the job done the globalist mafia

[39:40.320 --> 39:45.200]  local city governments and having governments invest money in fake
[39:45.200 --> 39:51.000]  schemes Al Capone did 80 plus years ago he would go down and hang out with the
[39:51.000 --> 39:55.560]  with the Rockefeller family in Hot Springs, Arkansas and gamble for months
[39:55.560 --> 40:01.560]  and have you know sex with two three hookers and a day that's on record

[40:10.960 --> 40:19.560]  plus invest your tax money in fake schemes now they took that model in the
[40:19.560 --> 40:23.840]  40s and created the comprehensive annual financial reports it's mafia our
[40:23.840 --> 40:29.120]  government is run by mafia and they run the CIA they run the FBI Dine Corps runs
[40:29.120 --> 40:32.720]  the child kidnapping rings on record no one stops them they don't get in
[40:32.720 --> 40:38.080]  trouble it's just a totally lawless group of criminals that ship in all the
[40:38.080 --> 40:42.800]  drugs they want they murder whoever they want they run insurance scams in every
[40:42.800 --> 40:46.720]  major city taking insurance out on people and murdering them they have hit
[40:46.720 --> 40:50.080]  teams on the police departments that carry out the murders it is just a
[40:50.080 --> 40:54.360]  completely rotten group and they decided to go ahead and blow the economy
[40:54.360 --> 40:58.280]  fully and take all your pension funds and rob everything because why should you
[40:58.280 --> 41:04.920]  a schmuck in their eyes why should you a chump a sucker an ignoramus fool be

[41:13.600 --> 41:19.480]  take everything you've got you know I knew this over a decade ago local
[41:19.480 --> 41:23.520]  lawyers told me this off record that work in the city but since then the last
[41:23.520 --> 41:27.320]  six months it's been in mainstream news become a big scandal that Walmart takes
[41:27.320 --> 41:30.960]  two three million dollars out on these greeters now at least they don't kill
[41:30.960 --> 41:34.160]  them like the local hit teams do in every city oh yeah they take it out on
[41:34.160 --> 41:37.560]  your grandma she never knows there was a million on her they kill her they love
[41:37.560 --> 41:41.200]  old people it's their favorite they'll just sneak in poison their food they'll
[41:41.200 --> 41:44.400]  have a heart attack then they get the cash that way nobody suspects they
[41:44.400 --> 41:47.880]  control the corner oh yeah this is your folks this is a murder team you're
[41:47.880 --> 41:51.400]  talking they just let me do you want the whole truth you want to know how this
[41:51.400 --> 41:55.960]  whole thing works well going back to Walmart they take two three million
[41:55.960 --> 42:01.560]  dollars out they've got actuaries they know that 79 year old who's had double
[42:01.560 --> 42:05.880]  bypasses statistically is going to die at a certain point they take out the
[42:05.880 --> 42:09.280]  insurance on them through the insurance pooling deal they've got deals with the
[42:09.280 --> 42:12.560]  insiders with kickbacks inside the insurance companies they know they're
[42:12.560 --> 42:17.320]  going to get two three mil it's going to pay out every year and that's why they
[42:17.320 --> 42:21.360]  stick those near-death people up there at the fronts of the things greeting you
[42:21.360 --> 42:29.120]  it's nothing but betting on the craps tables and you love it they know when
[42:29.120 --> 42:32.200]  the cancer viruses RNA they've implanted in you are going to kick in and
[42:32.200 --> 42:37.240]  activate they know when you're going to be sterilized by the way you know I
[42:37.240 --> 42:42.120]  oversimplified things I was talking last week about how the estrogen
[42:42.120 --> 42:45.840]  mimicking hormones this is now again all over the news they've known it from day
[42:45.840 --> 42:52.040]  one thousands of different combinations of plastic and worldwide in the 50s they
[42:52.040 --> 42:57.200]  standardized and had tax breaks you name it if certain types of plastic were
[42:57.200 --> 43:04.600]  adopted as liners and cans liners in food containers now it's in juice box
[43:04.600 --> 43:09.760]  containers water containers that leeches estrogen mimickers into it
[43:09.760 --> 43:13.160]  they're also carcinogenic so you wonder why five-year-old girls are now going into
[43:13.160 --> 43:16.680]  puberty used to be amazing and you know the eight-year-olds were now it's five
[43:16.680 --> 43:21.480]  year-olds you wonder why the females are are hyper feminine and the men are
[43:21.480 --> 43:26.200]  becoming effeminate and I pointed out that that's why homosexuality is way up
[43:26.200 --> 43:30.960]  and I got emails saying the little Romans were homosexual the Greeks were yes
[43:30.960 --> 43:36.080]  I know that I understand that that goes on previously in history I'm not saying
[43:36.080 --> 43:39.000]  there aren't people that have that sexual preference I'm saying it's
[43:39.000 --> 43:46.120]  increased chemically that's why they have frogs that are now bisexual who are
[43:46.120 --> 43:50.200]  hemaphrodites and fish in some areas almost all of them where they're
[43:50.200 --> 43:54.240]  dumping these chemicals into the water supply so much of it is in our sewage
[43:54.240 --> 43:59.000]  that passes through us birth control estrogen mimicking plastics that the
[43:59.000 --> 44:07.520]  frogs are hemaphrodites statistically you can pull up the numbers in the last 30
[44:07.520 --> 44:11.040]  years there are a lot more hemaphrodites in the Western world people being born
[44:11.040 --> 44:15.640]  with both sexual organs that isn't a preference folks those people are screwed
[44:15.640 --> 44:20.440]  up from the chemicals that they got in utero through the placenta I've read the
[44:20.440 --> 44:26.400]  studies but yes it's my fault that I got four or five emails that I saw I'm sure
[44:26.400 --> 44:30.080]  it was more you know saying hey you know they how come there were people that
[44:30.080 --> 44:35.280]  were gay before obviously I know that I'm saying an artificial increase in it
[44:35.280 --> 44:40.720]  okay look little girdles aren't supposed to go into puberty when they're five
[44:40.720 --> 44:47.560]  that's supposed to go into their 12 or 13 boys are effeminate they're on
[44:47.560 --> 44:55.760]  estrogen all right I'm gonna shut up I said I take your calls I just it's just
[44:55.760 --> 44:59.960]  a total crime syndicate don't you get it you've been gullible you've been
[44:59.960 --> 45:07.080]  stupid I've been stupid I've been lazy we're in deep deep trouble here you know
[45:07.080 --> 45:09.800]  what I'm just gonna suspend covering I mean I haven't even gotten to it I mean
[45:09.800 --> 45:15.480]  just just look at this sea creatures flee oil spill gather near shore
[45:15.480 --> 45:20.560]  thousands of dolphins big sharks well but it's amazing to go videotape that but
[45:20.560 --> 45:26.400]  again you have no first amendment armed goons just show up even kick ABC CBS CNN
[45:26.400 --> 45:30.760]  off the beach people say well why don't I go there I can't do everything yeah I'd
[45:30.760 --> 45:33.800]  be an interesting story for me to go to Louisiana and show guys threatening to
[45:33.800 --> 45:39.520]  throw me off the beach and okay I get thrown in jail I mean we know I would go
[45:39.520 --> 45:43.720]  there if it wasn't being reported that they were arresting people and throwing
[45:43.720 --> 45:47.320]  them off but it's admitted I can play you a YouTube clip and show it to you but
[45:47.320 --> 45:52.520]  that's the tyranny sea creatures flee oil spill gather near shore dolphins and
[45:52.520 --> 45:55.920]  sharks are showing up surprisingly shallow water just off the Florida coast
[45:55.920 --> 46:00.160]  mullets crabs raves and small fish congregate by the thousands often
[46:00.160 --> 46:04.640]  Alabama pier birds covered in oil are crawling deep into the marshes never to
[46:04.640 --> 46:08.040]  be seen again marine science studying the effects of B.P. disaster are seeing
[46:08.040 --> 46:12.160]  more strange phenomenon fish and wildlife seem to be fleeing the oil out of the
[46:12.160 --> 46:15.640]  gulf and clustering and cleaner waters along the coast in a trend that some
[46:15.640 --> 46:19.680]  researchers see as a potentially troubling sign
[46:19.680 --> 46:26.880]  well what happens when a volcano goes off and spews lava into the ocean animals
[46:26.880 --> 46:30.400]  dying I'm not saying this is good the point is this is not the end of the
[46:30.400 --> 46:35.600]  world the media is distracting you what could be the end of the world is an
[46:35.600 --> 46:40.120]  attack on Iran I'm gonna cover that next hour yes that could be the end of
[46:40.120 --> 46:44.480]  civilization as we know it this earth was born out of fire it was born out of
[46:44.480 --> 46:54.960]  going through the Kuiper belt every 25 million years being hit by thousands in
[46:54.960 --> 47:01.520]  a million-year period of giant asteroids destroying all life all large
[47:01.520 --> 47:05.720]  life on the planet and then coming back from plants and plankton and smaller
[47:05.720 --> 47:11.720]  organisms this earth is is is is is potmarked look at the surface of the
[47:11.720 --> 47:17.920]  moon look at Shoemaker Levy going into Saturn breaking up into five pieces
[47:17.920 --> 47:27.080]  blowing holes in Saturn's atmosphere bigger than the earth okay this oil spill
[47:27.080 --> 47:32.520]  is not wormwood it is not one-third of the world's oceans dying but genetically
[47:32.520 --> 47:36.840]  engineered nanotech getting into the ocean could be that's the real threat
[47:36.840 --> 47:40.320]  and they've got thousands of companies around the clock randomly splicing
[47:40.320 --> 47:45.800]  genetics looking for advancements in in health care and advancements in weapons
[47:45.800 --> 47:52.880]  and advancements in in in micro processing that could create wormwood
[47:53.680 --> 47:58.200]  that's the passage in the Bible
[47:58.200 --> 48:11.280]  wormwood beached wood rotten on the side of the ocean shore one-third of the
[48:11.280 --> 48:14.720]  animals dead that is not what has happened and that is not what's going to
[48:14.720 --> 48:19.560]  happen Obama administration spends 1.2 billion on cycling and walking
[48:19.560 --> 48:22.320]  initiatives yeah three months ago in the Wall Street Journal the head of the
[48:22.320 --> 48:27.000]  transportation department said our job is dismantling the use of cars not
[48:27.000 --> 48:31.200]  funding highways and ending industrialized society what have you heard
[48:31.200 --> 48:35.720]  from all these people what have you heard I saw more quotes just today by
[48:35.720 --> 48:40.640]  administration officials not public servants about how the it's their job
[48:40.640 --> 48:47.120]  to dismantle our industrial society they're doing a great job there's no
[48:47.120 --> 48:52.480]  industry left but their powerhouse China is growing 10 plus percent growth rate
[48:52.480 --> 48:56.720]  every year because they know how to kill off their population they know how to
[48:56.720 --> 49:02.600]  serve the new world order and the article goes on on a telegraph to say it's to
[49:02.600 --> 49:06.640]  get people out of their cars which sounds reasonable if you want to but not
[49:06.640 --> 49:10.480]  that cars are bad see the secret is they built our country with the big
[49:10.480 --> 49:14.840]  highways in the mega cities based on sprawl based on the highways there's no
[49:14.840 --> 49:18.320]  way to reverse this they got us right where they want us the Pentagon designed
[49:18.320 --> 49:23.440]  it where we're dependent on fossil fuels dependent on super highways and now
[49:23.440 --> 49:27.280]  they're going to cut that off to us now they're going to bankrupt you and drive
[49:27.280 --> 49:31.400]  you into globalist submission here's another one New Orleans runs five
[49:31.400 --> 49:36.200]  million dollar anti-british campaign paid for by BP blaming it on the
[49:36.200 --> 49:39.720]  British people and saying this isn't the first time New Orleans has survived the
[49:39.720 --> 49:46.320]  British attack yeah when the British Navy came in and Andrew Jackson fought
[49:46.320 --> 49:53.880]  them off I guess you could say the majority it's not even a majority but
[49:53.880 --> 49:58.680]  the biggest group was it 27% of the shareholders are British and it's
[49:58.680 --> 50:02.880]  broken up in other countries the Dutch are the next the Americans the next I
[50:02.880 --> 50:06.920]  mean it's a it's a red herring yeah let's blame the British let's blame the
[50:06.920 --> 50:11.360]  average Brett under new order control having their water poison their food
[50:11.360 --> 50:15.840]  poison global government coming down on them being sucked into the euro and they
[50:15.840 --> 50:19.520]  run stupid ads about a miracle stand up against the British what does it have to
[50:19.520 --> 50:23.280]  do with anything it's another distraction meanwhile the chairman of BP can't
[50:23.280 --> 50:29.360]  even speak proper English Iran threatens to stop Western ships is
[50:29.360 --> 50:33.560]  objected to cargo inspection that's gonna be our top story after I take calls
[50:33.560 --> 50:39.800]  crude oil drops and prices gold rises after jobless claims 100 Italian
[50:39.800 --> 50:43.560]  economists say austerity that means higher taxes less government services

[54:33.680 --> 54:38.160]  they always talk to you real sweet fatherly or motherly mpr voice the
[54:38.160 --> 54:46.200]  politicians we're not with the extremist we're the mainstream don't raise your
[54:46.200 --> 54:57.200]  voice don't get excited it's like the computer the howl 9000 in 2001 space

[55:08.680 --> 55:14.760]  supposed to go oh you're talking to us in a soft Dave voice by the way they
[55:14.760 --> 55:19.440]  talked about mind control last night on MSNBC I couldn't believe it they hate
[55:19.440 --> 55:23.920]  Glenn Beck so much that they actually admitted that he's using manipulative
[55:23.920 --> 55:30.720]  psychological warfare techniques but see they're actually tattling on
[55:30.720 --> 55:35.880]  themselves that shows that they realize what they're doing and that they use
[55:35.880 --> 55:39.720]  those techniques all the time consciously all those techniques are just
[55:39.720 --> 55:50.120]  based on normal human persuasiveness but you got as a bunch of losers who aren't
[55:50.120 --> 55:54.720]  passionate who aren't charismatic who aren't persuasive who lie to themselves
[55:54.720 --> 56:01.040]  and tell them themselves there's all these techniques to manipulate no the
[56:01.040 --> 56:06.920]  truth is what is powerful and that's something you can't ever compare to
[56:06.920 --> 56:11.480]  that's why Glenn Beck has taken on a lot of the truth and attached it to his
[56:11.480 --> 56:16.560]  hermit crab shell as camouflage but he has been exposed as well all right I
[56:16.560 --> 56:19.440]  said I'd go to your calls don't forget ladies and gentlemen but I'm gonna talk
[56:19.440 --> 56:23.600]  about that more coming up when I get into the MSNBC piece don't forget folks

[01:00:47.800 --> 01:00:52.040]  well yeah because that's what they're planning to do see they create the crisis
[01:00:52.040 --> 01:00:54.920]  they offer the solution okay I'm gonna try to hurry through your calls now is
[01:00:54.920 --> 01:00:59.400]  I got a bunch of news I want to hit as well Lawrence in California was getting
[01:00:59.400 --> 01:01:03.560]  into the red pill versus the blue pill and the awakening of humanity go ahead
[01:01:03.560 --> 01:01:08.720]  and finish your point yes I'm actually the point I was trying to make I was
[01:01:08.720 --> 01:01:14.680]  a question because I've been promoting this book since I started writing and
[01:01:14.680 --> 01:01:17.880]  I've been giving out chapters to different people that I know and they've
[01:01:17.880 --> 01:01:21.200]  been loving it they've been telling me to get it done especially my uncle which
[01:01:21.200 --> 01:01:27.320]  is of that he's a marine and the thing is I've been trying to get it to these
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:32.400]  publishing companies and it's kind of like I'm being blackballed they're
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:36.000]  telling me no one cared about this situation this is something that no one
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:40.280]  wants to look at our repake their time out the read well number one something
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:44.720]  look at me if it's a good book that's a great title nothing is hotter than the
[01:01:44.720 --> 01:01:48.760]  awakening happening right now and the system knows that that's why they cover
[01:01:48.760 --> 01:01:54.240]  us constantly just to try to stay relevant and in the game the issue is
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:58.840]  the publishing industry is imploding the economy is imploding people don't read
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:03.280]  books like they did before Hollywood's even losing money the record industry
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:07.600]  is on the verge of collapsing Main Street news is even admitting that right
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:16.760]  now so it's very tough I had to self-publish my own book and I didn't
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:22.200]  even reprint it you know I sold 15,000 copies you know I printed 5,000 sold
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.680]  them right away this was eight years ago nine years ago and I thought well I'll
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:31.000]  just print 10,000 these sold so quick but I didn't know that you sell
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:34.960]  everything up front I was still ignorant then I learned more every day and so it
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:39.400]  took me until just a few months ago to sell the additional 10,000 and so I'm
[01:02:39.400 --> 01:02:43.280]  not going back into reprinting of that book because I can't afford to print
[01:02:43.280 --> 01:02:47.880]  5,000 or so and then wait four or five years to sell them you know I can only
[01:02:47.880 --> 01:02:52.200]  make something new hot intriguing and then try to fund myself right off the
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:57.720]  bat and so that's the nature of it there's a glut of patriot info because
[01:02:57.720 --> 01:03:02.480]  it is hot the problem is a lot of it's not well written or there's so much of
[01:03:02.480 --> 01:03:06.480]  it and people don't have a distribution system to get their material out but if
[01:03:06.480 --> 01:03:12.240]  I was you I would go to some of the self-publishers out there or some of the
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:16.720]  people on demand and where you can retain your copyright but have them print
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:20.360]  it and then go out and advertise your book you know create a website write
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:23.800]  about your book blog about your book make YouTube videos about your book
[01:03:23.800 --> 01:03:27.440]  hammer hammer hammer and the journey of a thousand miles starts the single step
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:31.360]  I appreciate your call let me give you some advice I started out on Axos TV now
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:38.920]  almost 16 years ago talk radio 15 years ago and I was paid $200 a week at first
[01:03:38.920 --> 01:03:44.800]  and then a year into it I had a weekday show and I was paid $400 a week my radio
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:49.080]  show generated over $40,000 a month for the station I didn't have it I didn't
[01:03:49.080 --> 01:03:53.840]  have a manager I didn't have an agent I didn't know anything I was getting as
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:57.320]  high ratings as Howard Stern had on the local station the local station was
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:04:05.200]  paying for that show $300,000 a year and the other host that were local had no
[01:04:05.200 --> 01:04:09.040]  ratings I didn't know why they were all so jealous and literally hated me with a
[01:04:09.040 --> 01:04:13.400]  passion well they weren't talk show host shark man was his nickname he was a real
[01:04:13.400 --> 01:04:18.440]  syndicated former CBS guy who'd been all over the country he recognized me as a
[01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:23.000]  talent on access he got me my job in radio and then they basically laid him
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:27.560]  off and he went to Phoenix to do a show I gotta get a hold of shark man I know
[01:04:27.560 --> 01:04:30.720]  what name he's going by now I even forget his real name pop my head in a
[01:04:30.720 --> 01:04:36.160]  minute a real radio guy gave me my job okay then he left and these these
[01:04:36.160 --> 01:04:40.960]  jealous nobodies I mean one guy had never even been in radio and he was the
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:44.760]  program director and I had these huge ratings tons of money and so they hated
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:48.840]  me even more then Jay Leno's are talked about me and national news talked about
[01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:53.040]  me BBC was there the day they fired me and they said get out of here because
[01:04:53.040 --> 01:04:57.120]  the the owners of the station were globalist and they found out that I was

[01:07:10.800 --> 01:07:14.720]  to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's true
[01:07:14.720 --> 01:07:18.360]  total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:07:18.360 --> 01:07:22.920]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:26.960]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:30.760]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:07:30.760 --> 01:07:34.400]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather

[01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:08.680]  around us even now in this very room you can see it when you look out your
[01:08:08.680 --> 01:08:14.440]  window or when you turn on your television you can feel it when you go
[01:08:14.440 --> 01:08:23.680]  to work when you go to church when you pay your taxes it is the world that has
[01:08:23.680 --> 01:08:28.120]  been pulled over your eyes to blind you from the truth
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:31.400]  what truth
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:40.320]  that you are a slave neo like everyone else you were born into bondage born
[01:08:40.320 --> 01:08:54.040]  into a prison that you cannot smell or taste or touch a prison for your mind
[01:08:54.040 --> 01:09:04.200]  unfortunately no one can be told what the matrix is you have to see it for
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:20.120]  yourself this is your last chance after this there is no turning back you take
[01:09:20.120 --> 01:09:25.520]  the blue pill the story ends you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:32.000]  want to be you take the red pill you stay in wonderland and I show you how
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:35.280]  deep the rabbit hole goes
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:57.040]  remember all I'm offering is the truth nothing more
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:16.320]  Monday through Friday from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. central standard time we are here
[01:10:16.320 --> 01:10:21.840]  live thank you for joining us we're gonna go live at present planet dot TV in
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:27.720]  the third and fourth hour today we do have Lindsey Williams on part two of
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:32.400]  his oil spill expose in the final hour today I'm continuing your phone calls
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:36.360]  our first caller and I'm gonna get to the others here in a moment but I want to
[01:10:36.360 --> 01:10:40.800]  answer Lawrence's question from California he was asking if he's written a
[01:10:40.800 --> 01:10:45.560]  book how to get it published and I was telling him that it's great to try to get
[01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:49.800]  a big publisher to do it up front but generally it's best to self publish
[01:10:49.800 --> 01:10:54.680]  something and just get it done and then create a blog a website and promote your
[01:10:54.680 --> 01:11:00.200]  book make videos about it make podcast and if you've got the message and if
[01:11:00.200 --> 01:11:04.320]  you've got the material if you've got the talent if you build it they will come
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:09.880]  and then I was briefly going back to my starting radio it's a good thing I
[01:11:09.880 --> 01:11:14.160]  wasn't doing this to be successful and to be a big shot I had no intention of
[01:11:14.160 --> 01:11:20.240]  that zero I wanted to defend the Second Amendment I wanted to defend property
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:24.800]  rights I wanted to stop illegal wars I didn't want America financing a global
[01:11:24.800 --> 01:11:30.360]  corporate empire I wanted to abolish the private Federal Reserve I understood
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:34.880]  these things I understood that when I went to college those colleges were
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:40.760]  anti-freedom anti-America and I knew that we were under threat as a society
[01:11:40.760 --> 01:11:46.360]  and so I began to expose it and I didn't understand why right away I got high
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:50.280]  ratings and there were self-destructive people that ran the radio station the
[01:11:50.280 --> 01:11:54.600]  good people had left who'd hired me and that they were mad that I was so
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:58.760]  successful they were mad that I was all over the newspaper and that I was making
[01:11:58.760 --> 01:12:06.680]  national news hard copy extra BBC ABC nightly news they were angry that's why
[01:12:06.680 --> 01:12:13.960]  they ended up losing their jobs later after they fired me and the owners who
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:18.080]  owned a bunch of radio stations shamrock communications and who owned a bunch of
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:22.600]  radio stations and newspapers you know they came down and they told me you
[01:12:22.600 --> 01:12:26.360]  quit talking about the New World Order you talk about sex and partying and fun
[01:12:26.360 --> 01:12:29.920]  things or you're fired and I said but I'm making you all this money I have high
[01:12:29.920 --> 01:12:35.280]  ratings and I I said I really can't and they said you will you'll lose your job
[01:12:35.280 --> 01:12:40.280]  and a few weeks later they fired me but I didn't care it was all about the truth
[01:12:40.280 --> 01:12:44.920]  what would be the point of being on talk radio and being able to talk to
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:52.800]  people and not talking about the truth not defending my family my culture my
[01:12:52.800 --> 01:13:00.320]  society I cannot sell out I will not sell out that's why the globalist attacked
[01:13:00.320 --> 01:13:03.600]  me constantly through their Co and tell pro from above and below from the
[01:13:03.600 --> 01:13:07.800]  establishment and these fake anti-establishment as a sellout because
[01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:12.760]  that's the only avenue they've got I'm so real I'm so bonafide I'm such a real
[01:13:12.760 --> 01:13:19.880]  McCoy the fruit of my labor is so real and so effective and so dangerous that
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:25.840]  they attack me from every quarter and it's intensifying because I have the
[01:13:25.840 --> 01:13:30.100]  spirit of victory I got a lot of problems and I'm not perfect but people
[01:13:30.100 --> 01:13:35.040]  can model after what I've done and they can build upon it and improve upon it
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:39.160]  and I know we can beat these people because we're in the right and if we
[01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:43.480]  just don't stop and we keep moving forward the new world order is going
[01:13:43.480 --> 01:13:51.600]  down big time and so don't expect so many people start little political
[01:13:51.600 --> 01:13:55.640]  organizations and they plan and they organize and they constantly talk about
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:59.480]  what they're gonna do and they they constantly talk about how they're gonna
[01:13:59.480 --> 01:14:03.080]  write a book or they're gonna have an access TV show or they're gonna get a
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:07.080]  local radio show or they're gonna go to their state house or they're gonna
[01:14:07.080 --> 01:14:11.560]  organize a march but they never do it they have committee meetings after
[01:14:11.560 --> 01:14:15.880]  committee meetings just get on the street get into the state houses get
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:21.240]  into the city councils run for office get aggressive don't be apologetic be
[01:14:21.240 --> 01:14:27.880]  fiery that's what the people want they want red blood they want oxygen filled
[01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:35.880]  blood not stale blue blood garbage you know what blue blood is folks the
[01:14:35.880 --> 01:14:39.280]  loblists have good names for themselves blue bloods blood that doesn't have
[01:14:39.280 --> 01:14:45.720]  oxygen in it is blue that's why your veins are blue but the blood we think of
[01:14:45.720 --> 01:14:51.240]  that we see on the ground spilt in the fight for liberty is red because it's
[01:14:51.240 --> 01:14:58.120]  spilt outside the body it's it's been spilt it's been released and when that
[01:14:58.120 --> 01:15:01.800]  blood comes out of your lungs and is pounded through your heart and sent out
[01:15:01.800 --> 01:15:08.520]  to your body it's red it's animated it's red blood are you red blooded or are you
[01:15:08.520 --> 01:15:15.480]  a cold swimy vampiric blue blood are you an undead is your soul dead or does it
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:24.120]  have the animating fire of liberty in it the enemy tells you lay down be weak be
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:31.360]  soft-spoken this is the doctrine of losers this is the doctrine of slaves you
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:34.920]  need to become authoritative you need to become assertive you need to commit
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:40.360]  all right I'm gonna stop preaching ah the point is Lawrence don't wait for a
[01:15:40.360 --> 01:15:43.800]  silver platter and you haven't done that you've written the book take action
[01:15:43.800 --> 01:15:49.920]  take action now while you're still alive while you're sucking air let's talk
[01:15:49.920 --> 01:15:56.040]  to Jim in Texas you're on the air Jim hey Alex how you doing I'm all right
[01:15:56.040 --> 01:16:01.120]  brother what's on your mind today well there's so much I'm trying to just
[01:16:01.120 --> 01:16:05.680]  touch on a couple of things up sometimes an allegory which is what you're
[01:16:05.680 --> 01:16:10.360]  talking about in the matrix can get through to a person subconscious when
[01:16:10.360 --> 01:16:16.000]  they've been programmed or brainwashed when facts cannot that is the reason why
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:20.200]  stories such as the matrix or you can even go back thousands of years to
[01:16:20.200 --> 01:16:25.240]  Socrates and Plato such as the cave in the Republic chapter 7 yeah that's what
[01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:30.040]  the Truman show is right right they're trying to expose all these things
[01:16:30.040 --> 01:16:34.400]  through fables and allegories because a lot of people when they're subconsciously
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:40.440]  brainwashed now they're comfortable with their servitude because their
[01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:44.120]  subconscious brain is a lot more powerful than their conscious so everybody
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:47.960]  knows they're in a matrix slash Truman show they're in a Truman show being
[01:16:47.960 --> 01:16:52.840]  inserted into an actual matrix that's the Pentagon plan from the 1960s
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:58.960]  declassified in January of 2000 but you're absolutely right and go ahead
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:04.160]  well I was just you know I just find it really interesting that even Orwell who
[01:17:04.160 --> 01:17:10.600]  his real name of course was Eric Blair who was the son of a British nobleman
[01:17:10.600 --> 01:17:15.400]  officer in the Bengal Wars he learned early that this was all a fraud and
[01:17:15.400 --> 01:17:19.400]  whether you were told that socialism communism capitalism or whatever was
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:23.800]  the way it was all lies meant to deceive you because we were all being
[01:17:23.800 --> 01:17:29.560]  controlled by the same apex of the pyramid and what are you talking about
[01:17:29.560 --> 01:17:36.360]  economically socially politically it's all a Ponzi scheme based upon a pyramid
[01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:41.200]  scheme that's that's what our whole world is and then I congratulate you on
[01:17:41.200 --> 01:17:47.200]  pointing that out let me say it to your earlier color Lawrence Lawrence there's
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:50.480]  been people since Socrates time we're all the way back to you know you can go
[01:17:50.480 --> 01:17:55.640]  back to 1960 and read Vance Packard the waste makers there's so much information
[01:17:55.640 --> 01:18:01.080]  out there Alex you do the greatest job by far of enlightening people on to this
[01:18:01.080 --> 01:18:07.360]  stuff but I hate to say it my friend we are losing and we are casting for the
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:12.480]  most part our pearls before swine and I believe right now is the time that the
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:17.120]  Lord Jesus Christ talked about when those who will listen had better flee these
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:20.560]  cities and prepare because this is the last thing I want to say real history
[01:18:20.560 --> 01:18:26.600]  this is real history in World War two from Stalingrad all the way to Warsaw
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:31.800]  Danzig all through the Eastern Bloc nations those people were under siege
[01:18:31.800 --> 01:18:36.320]  for years in those cities after the first year there was nothing left to eat
[01:18:36.320 --> 01:18:41.240]  they ate the rats they ate the dead after the second year they were coming out
[01:18:41.240 --> 01:18:47.720]  of in gangs out of the sewers and attacking and eating people by night you
[01:18:47.720 --> 01:18:52.480]  people better wake up out there you're not going to listen but you better get
[01:18:52.480 --> 01:18:57.360]  the hell out of these big metropolitan metropolitan cities and get yourself to
[01:18:57.360 --> 01:19:03.200]  some degree able to sustain yourself with water and food and this this is a
[01:19:03.200 --> 01:19:06.440]  final warning I believe you're right Alex that World War three is right on
[01:19:06.440 --> 01:19:13.120]  horizon and that is the only way that these elite people have out every time
[01:19:13.120 --> 01:19:19.080]  they're gonna lose power Lord Milner in in 1918 said at the end of World War
[01:19:19.080 --> 01:19:24.760]  one we're gonna hire a German dictator and have him wreck Europe and in the
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:30.200]  next 20 years and they did it I mean the British Intel put the Communist in I
[01:19:30.200 --> 01:19:37.080]  mean the that's the reason they're so hard to beat is they will they will
[01:19:37.080 --> 01:19:42.320]  hire Mao Zedong and have him kill 64 to 80 plus million depending on the
[01:19:42.320 --> 01:19:47.160]  numbers you look at just to get power they enjoy it human life means nothing
[01:19:47.160 --> 01:19:51.920]  to them and I agree with you it is good to get self-sufficient it is essential
[01:19:51.920 --> 01:19:57.520]  and they are courting World War three right now they are seriously looking at
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:05.360]  it we'll be right back the problem how do I cook food without power how do I

[01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:45.560]  don't know how much do you want all you can get I'm Alex Jones I want all of you
[01:23:45.560 --> 01:23:52.760]  good guys to live to fight another day call 1-800-409-5633 or check it out on
[01:23:52.760 --> 01:24:18.960]  the web at eFoodsDirect.com again that number 1-800-409-5633
[01:24:18.960 --> 01:24:26.640]  you know Jim in Texas brought up World War III type scenarios and a lot of
[01:24:26.640 --> 01:24:33.600]  mainline analysts say that a strike on Iran runs from bad to worst I mean they
[01:24:33.600 --> 01:24:38.760]  all agree they had rid runs from very serious repercussions to all out
[01:24:38.760 --> 01:24:44.720]  thermal nuclear war with China and Russia now the global is starting to move
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:50.680]  against Iran unless they've gotten Russia and China to sign off on that at
[01:24:50.680 --> 01:24:54.800]  least common sense would say that but remember Cheney launched the 888 attack
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:24:59.800]  and it's now been declassified that he did want to start a nuclear war with
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:05.560]  Russia so there's some truly insane people inside the power structure the
[01:25:05.560 --> 01:25:12.560]  more insane the more bold people with more bravada more hubris more hoots bow
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:18.140]  whatever word you want to use crazy confidence tend to get into positions of
[01:25:18.140 --> 01:25:26.680]  power and what concerns me is you see Dr. Eric Bianca Dr. Peter Singer Al Gore
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:31.080]  all these different shows on Discovery Channel about the end of humanity the
[01:25:31.080 --> 01:25:36.200]  end of humans how great the world would be I mean here's two headlines today
[01:25:36.200 --> 01:25:40.120]  professor only global governance can save us from a century of chaos and
[01:25:40.120 --> 01:25:45.760]  that's out of the Daily Mail and then the professor goes on to say total
[01:25:45.760 --> 01:25:52.160]  collapse by 2014 or before a world war that it will happen that humans always
[01:25:52.160 --> 01:25:56.000]  do this well the elites are implementing it right now and I'm not just
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:25:59.920]  saying that I have the ram corporation saying that they need a new war I mean
[01:25:59.920 --> 01:26:02.560]  you see them gearing up for it you see them saying they're about to have a
[01:26:02.560 --> 01:26:07.000]  blockade of Iran that's an act of war as Ron Paul has said on the house floor
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:15.080]  not just me saying that that's what the law says look at this Harold son our
[01:26:15.080 --> 01:26:19.640]  own extinction is forecast within 100 years but that's a good thing the
[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:22.880]  Australian you know basically reports you read the whole article because humans
[01:26:22.880 --> 01:26:29.920]  are bad we're too stupid see the the globalist are in hundreds of movies the
[01:26:29.920 --> 01:26:37.160]  last decade literally hundreds hundreds it's got to be 10 or 15 last year about
[01:26:37.160 --> 01:26:40.720]  the end of the world and apocalypse they are conditioning the subconscious mind
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:45.280]  to accept mass death and corruption so that you will just lay down and take it
[01:26:45.280 --> 01:26:52.080]  oh it's the end of the world I am a Christian I am Bible believing and I
[01:26:52.080 --> 01:26:59.080]  think it's very profound and makes Nostradamus look like a piker but it is
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:04.400]  misinterpreted and it is twisted and it is used be Christians in Nazi Germany
[01:27:04.400 --> 01:27:07.200]  laid down because they thought it was the end of the world Christians in China
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:09.880]  most of them laid down they thought it was the end of the world they thought
[01:27:09.880 --> 01:27:14.240]  Mao was the anti-Christ Christians in North Korea are almost extinct because
[01:27:14.240 --> 01:27:18.760]  they think the communist regime is the anti-Christ well in a way of actually
[01:27:18.760 --> 01:27:22.480]  read the Bible it says there are many anti-Christ anti-Christ spirit but only
[01:27:22.480 --> 01:27:28.120]  one who will become world ruler and whether you believe in God or not the
[01:27:28.120 --> 01:27:32.840]  globalist aren't of the occult the UN says they are going to have 10 global
[01:27:32.840 --> 01:27:39.280]  regions with 10 kingdoms I mean they are following revelation as a blueprint the
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:46.320]  world ID card face scan handprint to buy and sell holograms the beast computer
[01:27:46.320 --> 01:27:50.520]  speaking in Jerusalem and being seen by all the people of the world
[01:27:50.520 --> 01:27:59.760]  simultaneously giant metal dragon flies and locust dropping pillars of fire on
[01:27:59.760 --> 01:28:05.960]  cities I mean it's science fiction written almost 2,000 years ago on the
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:14.840]  Isle of Patmos if John the Revelator was on a drug I want some of what he was
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:21.880]  on this is an Isaac Asimov predicting high-tech systems 60 years ago and he
[01:28:21.880 --> 01:28:26.480]  was a visionary his foundation series is about computer programs being able to
[01:28:26.480 --> 01:28:31.960]  predict the future which they already have now that's admitted they they admit
[01:28:31.960 --> 01:28:37.560]  93 to 97 percent accuracy in predicting where you're going to do where you're
[01:28:37.560 --> 01:28:40.280]  going to go how long you're going to stay somewhere what you're going to do
[01:28:40.280 --> 01:28:48.920]  with total precision they're not telling you that they have it even more
[01:28:48.920 --> 01:28:54.440]  advanced near total precision they're not telling you it's even more advanced
[01:28:54.440 --> 01:29:00.360]  of predictive mapping on how you behave what you do the government knows what
[01:29:00.360 --> 01:29:05.360]  website you're going to visit before you visit it they know your rhythms they
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:13.560]  know your patterns they understand you and so they are reaching a counterfeit
[01:29:13.560 --> 01:29:19.480]  level of omnipresence it isn't real they're still weak humans they're still
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:25.360]  passion driven by their by their id by their ego by their subconscious they're
[01:29:25.360 --> 01:29:32.000]  still the wild beast the wild primitive now taking heads of their enemies but
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:38.040]  now they've got atom bombs hydrogen bombs they've got computerized crystal
[01:29:38.040 --> 01:29:43.040]  balls they've got superconducting super colliding cyclotrons now they've got
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:47.000]  space planes now they've got predictive computer systems now they've got race
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:51.280]  specific bio weapons they're Bill Gates they're on power trips we're on the

[01:33:37.720 --> 01:33:44.640]  claims gold is up a whole lot today like let me just actually pull up the latest
[01:33:44.640 --> 01:33:50.800]  on gold I haven't looked at that in about 20 minutes it's hard to do this live
[01:33:50.800 --> 01:33:57.480]  on air but we'll do it gold as if you can't do this yourself let's go ahead
[01:33:57.480 --> 01:34:03.640]  well I want to know so I'm gonna find out right now gold is up $17.10
[01:34:03.640 --> 01:34:15.240]  since today to $1,247 an ounce crude oil fail and gold future state hire Thursday
[01:34:15.240 --> 01:34:19.000]  after the Labor Department said US jobless claims arose by 12,000 last
[01:34:19.000 --> 01:34:28.320]  week crude oil for July delivery fell 76 cents or 1% to $76.91 a barrel the
[01:34:28.320 --> 01:34:34.200]  August contract fell 36 cents to 78 36 cents a barrel and gold for August
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:42.560]  delivery gained $15 to $1,245.50 an ounce so they're doing everything they
[01:34:42.560 --> 01:34:48.120]  can to suppress it because it exposes fiat currencies as the dangerous
[01:34:48.120 --> 01:34:54.520]  frauds they are and other forms of paper that the hedge fund lords who run the
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:59.080]  New World Order have gotten so rich off of they're not gonna be able to make
[01:34:59.080 --> 01:35:02.640]  five ten fifteen million dollars a piece the hundreds of these different
[01:35:02.640 --> 01:35:08.360]  scallywags every year if you become wise and stop buying their derivatives I
[01:35:08.360 --> 01:35:13.240]  mean anybody can go out on the street corner and say you know they'll give
[01:35:13.240 --> 01:35:16.720]  you a trillion dollar bill for a thousand dollars then you try to cash the
[01:35:16.720 --> 01:35:20.760]  trillion dollar bill and find out it's worthless but see only a select group of
[01:35:20.760 --> 01:35:26.480]  scammers the Ivy League crooks are allowed to engage in this you're not
[01:35:26.480 --> 01:35:32.760]  part of the money laundering slash counterfeiting scheme only the central
[01:35:32.760 --> 01:35:40.760]  banks are 100 Italian economists say austerity will destroy Europe you know
[01:35:40.760 --> 01:35:46.120]  I'm really proud of my film the Obama deception made year and a half ago right
[01:35:46.120 --> 01:35:50.040]  when Obama got an office because it's all about austerity and all about how
[01:35:50.040 --> 01:35:53.320]  they're gonna raise your taxes and cut your benefits before Obama was talking
[01:35:53.320 --> 01:35:56.800]  about that because we know what the IMF and World Bank do people that run
[01:35:56.800 --> 01:36:03.480]  Obama real name Barry Sitaro the Indonesian citizen of Kenyan
[01:36:03.480 --> 01:36:11.280]  Providence 100 Italian economists say austerity will destroy Europe from zero
[01:36:11.280 --> 01:36:15.840]  hedge up on info wars.com the telegraphs Ambrose Evans Pritchard points to a
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:23.080]  letter signed by 100 Italian economists who point out the Ponzi scheme is
[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:26.440]  taking place in which they note that the austerity strategy imposed by
[01:36:26.440 --> 01:36:30.200]  Brussels Frankfurt risk tipping Europe into a self-feeding downward spiral
[01:36:30.200 --> 01:36:35.840]  that's the plan so what if you have a hundred top economists saying that that's
[01:36:35.840 --> 01:36:41.960]  the plan that's like if they busted into a shack and Ted Bundy was over a ten
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:46.600]  year old girl biting huge bloody chunks out of her back and you said Ted Bundy
[01:36:46.600 --> 01:36:55.160]  you're gonna kill her of you he goes that's the point I mean it's crazy to
[01:36:55.160 --> 01:37:01.160]  not understand that it's Woody Woodpecker nuts again gold prices in the
[01:37:01.160 --> 01:37:11.000]  futures reach $1,254 and ounce federal reserve pushes up the debt and
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:15.560]  purchases US sovereign debt we got Bob Chapman on tomorrow about that and so
[01:37:15.560 --> 01:37:19.120]  you have the Federal Reserve more and more buying its own debt but then more
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:23.480]  debts created for us the Treasury offers money and the Federal Reserve comes in
[01:37:23.480 --> 01:37:26.600]  and buys it itself and that was one of the best lines last night out of a
[01:37:26.600 --> 01:37:31.560]  slime balls this little special that they hyped for a month was that they
[01:37:31.560 --> 01:37:36.080]  said some people in the Tea Party want to get rid of all government they say
[01:37:36.080 --> 01:37:40.840]  it's a tyranny they cut to me saying it's a tyranny some people want to get
[01:37:40.840 --> 01:37:47.240]  rid of all government they want it in the Fed and they cut to Rand Paul saying
[01:37:47.240 --> 01:37:53.080]  in the Fed in a speech knowing the average moron that watches MSNBC I mean
[01:37:53.080 --> 01:37:57.920]  you've really got to be a moron if you watch MSNBC and you believe that that
[01:37:57.920 --> 01:38:04.040]  isn't cartoon level propaganda it's more cartoonish than Fox News now because
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:07.440]  it's defending the establishment it seemed a little more sane was playing
[01:38:07.440 --> 01:38:12.320]  the part of the anti-establishment during Bush now Fox seems more sane
[01:38:12.320 --> 01:38:14.920]  playing the part of the anti-establishment as soon as the Republicans
[01:38:14.920 --> 01:38:21.240]  back in they'll be pro-establishment but I mean did you miss what I just said
[01:38:21.240 --> 01:38:25.280]  some of you out there that are new listeners it's very simple in the Fed
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:31.520]  means in the private fellow reserve but Chris Matthews this is a quote says some
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:36.920]  people want to get rid of all government abolish government entirely and they
[01:38:36.920 --> 01:38:46.200]  want to abolish the Federal Reserve and then they cut to Rand Paul saying in the
[01:38:46.200 --> 01:38:51.600]  Fed in the Fed Channing and knowing that one sentence before he said some of
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:55.440]  these people want to get rid of all government then he says like the Federal
[01:38:55.440 --> 01:39:00.080]  Reserve as if Federal Reserve is government then they cut to Rand Paul
[01:39:00.080 --> 01:39:05.560]  saying in the Fed see so that's a double lie they're telling you the Federal
[01:39:05.560 --> 01:39:10.600]  Reserve is government and is legitimate and that Rand Paul wants to abolish all
[01:39:10.600 --> 01:39:15.720]  government and that to end the Fed means to abolish all government but in a sick
[01:39:15.720 --> 01:39:19.160]  little lawyer way they love having what they say be the truth from one
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:26.040]  perspective it of course it's a lie but it is true the Fed is the only government
[01:39:26.040 --> 01:39:29.600]  it runs the military it runs the entire country the private bankers that took
[01:39:29.600 --> 01:39:37.880]  over 97 years ago in 1913 so we have that here here's another one government
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:43.520]  expanding like a cancer says Mark Fobber well that's how I always describe it
[01:39:45.280 --> 01:39:49.160]  let's see they're globalists they will evacuate the country after they've sucked
[01:39:49.160 --> 01:39:54.040]  it dry and broke it down government expanding like a cancer Mark Fobber says
[01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:57.440]  governments have intervened too much in the free market since the crisis started
[01:39:57.440 --> 01:40:00.440]  to the point that they are affecting the health of the world economy Mark Fobber
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:05.480]  the author of the gloom boom doom report told CNBC and of course he's predicted
[01:40:05.480 --> 01:40:09.360]  all of what's happening and as a frequent guest of this transmission here is a
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:16.880]  another headline along those same lines
[01:40:16.880 --> 01:40:24.720]  trying to find my headline I had a headline here
[01:40:24.720 --> 01:40:34.440]  oh yes here it is this is from CNBC serious market problems in the fall
[01:40:34.440 --> 01:40:39.760]  gold a hit $2500 an ounce is the headline and here to talk more about this
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:42.240]  article with us for the next five minutes and I'm going right back to your
[01:40:42.240 --> 01:40:47.360]  calls is Ted Anderson of minus resources also owns the Genesis network and he's
[01:40:47.360 --> 01:40:51.680]  who I trust to buy my precious metals from and who I do buy them from because
[01:40:51.680 --> 01:40:56.480]  it's the best deal out there the offers we give on this show are the best offers
[01:40:56.480 --> 01:41:00.280]  out there bar none now you need to make sure you say it's the Alex Jones special
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:06.280]  take advantage of these but if you're not moving some of your paper into gold
[01:41:06.280 --> 01:41:10.400]  and silver I don't know what planet you're living on gold just seven years
[01:41:10.400 --> 01:41:19.360]  ago was $260 an ounce now it's 1247 and 60 and climbing and mainstream news is
[01:41:19.360 --> 01:41:26.480]  having to admit 2500 by the way that's a conservative estimate I don't own gold
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:30.560]  because of that I don't own it to go cash it in I don't cash gold I bought at
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:35.280]  300 I don't buy gold I bought at 1200 I don't sell silver I bought at $5 an
[01:41:35.280 --> 01:41:41.760]  ounce with it at 19 I don't sell it it's an emergency backup because you can't
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:47.960]  trust in government you can't trust in anything in this world but God guts and
[01:41:47.960 --> 01:41:58.040]  guns and gold the G's let's bring up Ted Anderson Ted again you've got great
[01:41:58.040 --> 01:42:02.120]  offers for people yet again with your 30 plus years in the business most
[01:42:02.120 --> 01:42:06.640]  outlets are out or have giant premiums on gold that's all over the news but not
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:11.120]  Ted Anderson because you're in it for the long haul and so you've got the best
[01:42:11.120 --> 01:42:16.160]  deals Ted tell us about it yeah sure will I tell you that that Frank and
[01:42:16.160 --> 01:42:20.520]  forecaster offer I'm still holding that down at 265 despite the fact that gold
[01:42:20.520 --> 01:42:26.640]  has gone up off that $1,200 an ounce now trading at that 1200 and 17 1200 and
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:32.800]  that starts up $17 $1,200 and what is it 1248 60 so you know right now the
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:37.440]  market is very bullish the support levels in gold right now are a 1217 50
[01:42:37.440 --> 01:42:44.360]  that came up off of 1187 here just a few weeks ago which means that the
[01:42:44.360 --> 01:42:48.760]  chances of gold dipping below that number is pretty tight anyways the the
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:53.320]  deals right now Frank said 265 you do get the full year of the international
[01:42:53.320 --> 01:42:57.400]  forecaster for that I you just can't beat that deal I mean it with the
[01:42:57.400 --> 01:43:03.080]  discount of the forecaster newsletter at $159 it gets you down below $500 an
[01:43:03.080 --> 01:43:07.520]  ounce for gold I mean that's a fifth of an ounce of gold you can do the math but
[01:43:07.520 --> 01:43:12.880]  sober right now is just touching getting real close to $19 an ounce and I'm
[01:43:12.880 --> 01:43:16.320]  gonna have to start moving up the price on those walking Liberty halves if
[01:43:16.320 --> 01:43:22.360]  people are interested in that that coin right now is $9.75 and that coin I
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:26.920]  know my internet prices have jumped up over 10 I'm just holding that price
[01:43:26.920 --> 01:43:30.880]  down too Alex I'm gonna sell that buffalo coin until I can't no more
[01:43:30.880 --> 01:43:36.360]  there's a small supply out there in the marketplace I have some you know some
[01:43:36.360 --> 01:43:39.760]  quantity as long as I can deliver them I'm gonna sell them I'm gonna recommend
[01:43:39.760 --> 01:43:44.240]  people buy that coin too just because of the fact that it's you know that the US
[01:43:44.240 --> 01:43:47.800]  Mint makes such a small number of them and then when they get sold out they're
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:52.240]  just gone I mean most of last year you couldn't buy a buffalo coin these are
[01:43:52.240 --> 01:43:58.120]  the 2010s and they are just scarce really hard to get I have a supply in them
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:44:01.680]  I'm gonna sell them so if you're interested the US Mint puts out a
[01:44:01.680 --> 01:44:05.200]  limited number and they run out very very quickly and they just came out
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:11.600]  they're being snatched up and Ted's got a great price on those 800 686 2237
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:19.960]  800 686 2237 is the toll-free number to call and talk to the brokers any other
[01:44:19.960 --> 01:44:24.080]  coins Ted that people should know about yeah I you know the US Eagles banks of
[01:44:24.080 --> 01:44:27.880]  junk silver are real popular that stuff is getting incredibly scarce for those
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:31.360]  of you don't know what those are that's the dimes in the quarters and the haves
[01:44:31.360 --> 01:44:37.120]  they're they're really scarce and very close to melt value when when Paulson
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:42.120]  and Bush were talking about the tarp money that they became completely
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:45.800]  unavailable they were just sold out completely there was none available it
[01:44:45.800 --> 01:44:49.160]  was hard to get a hundred ounce silver bar for crime alone so that's a really
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:52.400]  good buy as well I mean there's a lot of products out there Alex said I'm getting
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:56.480]  my hands on and I just don't have enough time on the air to mention them all but
[01:44:56.480 --> 01:44:59.800]  I would suggest that if you're interested in looking at gold and silver like
[01:44:59.800 --> 01:45:03.960]  you said Alex this is summertime right now we're seeing the soft side of the
[01:45:03.960 --> 01:45:09.000]  market not the bullish side come come August September October I mean I say
[01:45:09.000 --> 01:45:14.000]  this every year with him every year it's true gold and silver are very hot in the
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:18.560]  fall right now you're seeing a bit of a bull market gold is reaching highs that
[01:45:18.560 --> 01:45:23.360]  it's never seen before silver is coming up and touching its highs and I gotta
[01:45:23.360 --> 01:45:27.840]  tell you this fall there's so much trouble in the economy right now and you
[01:45:27.840 --> 01:45:31.560]  take a look ahead and you put any one of those little time bombs are about to
[01:45:31.560 --> 01:45:35.960]  pop in that particular time frame right between August September October
[01:45:35.960 --> 01:45:39.960]  November I mean gold skyrockets during that time and that's when you see that
[01:45:39.960 --> 01:45:45.400]  I mean we're you know they're talking about $2,500 an ounce that's possible it
[01:45:45.400 --> 01:45:50.240]  does happen and it happens that volatility like you have that in the fall
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:57.160]  and that's what we're going regardless Ted look people need to start moving out
[01:45:57.160 --> 01:46:00.520]  of paper and you bought this gold when was it a lower price you're passing it
[01:46:00.520 --> 01:46:05.840]  on with the lower price as you always do but but it's about to go up again so
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:12.880]  ladies and gentlemen take advantage of this now 800 686 2237 800 686 237
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:16.760]  Ted thanks for coming on with us yeah thanks for having me up Alex you bet and
[01:46:16.760 --> 01:46:22.040]  I wanted to briefly go over some of this CNBC article the headline is serious
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:28.520]  market problems in the fall gold to hit $2,500 an ounce so that CNBC saying that
[01:46:28.520 --> 01:46:36.160]  not Alex Jones I quite frankly hope it doesn't hit that because if it does go
[01:46:36.160 --> 01:46:41.040]  to 2,500 which is what it's supposed to be due to inflation that means that our
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:45.560]  worst fears are coming true and obviously you can feel it in your gut you can see
[01:46:45.560 --> 01:46:53.160]  it this is a depression and I guess it's good to have a life raft and and gold
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:58.320]  financially in every case in history is that life raft but it says stocks fell
[01:46:58.320 --> 01:47:08.560]  on Tuesday as reports that jobless claims jumped last week and the Philly
[01:47:08.560 --> 01:47:17.440]  Fed gauge of manufacturing activity tumbled and it goes on a Christian
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:23.080]  thawadies president and chief executive of Sentinel asset management and Paul
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:28.280]  Schwartz president of hedge capital shared their views since we had the big
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:32.800]  May correction the market has been dominated entirely by macroeconomic
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:38.480]  and political events when that happens the market fundamentals tend to get
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:44.920]  pushed down they went on to say that economic news so far has not been bad
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:49.120]  and will support a possible two to three percent GDP growth they went on to
[01:47:49.120 --> 01:47:55.720]  say that they think that you see 100 $1,500 later this year and somewhere
[01:47:55.720 --> 01:48:03.400]  around 2,000 to 2,500 in this decade he said so we'll see what happens with that
[01:48:03.400 --> 01:48:08.680]  that's from CNBC but I think as a typo because this is today's news and says it
[01:48:08.680 --> 01:48:16.120]  says Tuesday it's Thursday folks or they're just bringing in news articles in
[01:48:16.120 --> 01:48:20.560]  here so fast I can't even keep track of them let's go ahead and go back to your
[01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:25.120]  calls thanks for holding Ernie you're on the air welcome hey Alex say one thing
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:29.240]  about your last caller talking about the people I feel bad about is people who
[01:48:29.240 --> 01:48:32.640]  never farm don't know how to pluck a chicken don't know how to skin it those
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:35.920]  are the people that are in trouble okay the two things I want to talk about
[01:48:35.920 --> 01:48:40.960]  blogovitch is right on I think you did a good CYA job bring them all down the
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:44.360]  other two things that bother me we got a president we got a crack in the ocean
[01:48:44.360 --> 01:48:48.000]  with an oil well and he sits there and looks at the American people and says
[01:48:48.000 --> 01:48:52.120]  we got to tax you the other thing it bothered me was watching a congressman
[01:48:52.120 --> 01:48:56.400]  assault two kids on the street they spin and flip it and then in South
[01:48:56.400 --> 01:48:59.920]  Carolina South Carolina they elect another guy to go for Congress who
[01:48:59.920 --> 01:49:04.560]  can't even speak English this guy green and there is like you're talking as
[01:49:04.560 --> 01:49:10.000]  something this is just all bizarre sir in a New York City I have the AP article
[01:49:10.000 --> 01:49:15.240]  and as I read this Wednesday I couldn't believe it I haven't even gotten to it
[01:49:15.240 --> 01:49:18.760]  that they the feds came into the town and it turns out they've done it in
[01:49:18.760 --> 01:49:24.400]  hundreds of towns and said we think one man one vote is racist so we're going
[01:49:24.400 --> 01:49:28.960]  to give six votes to certain people to get illegal aliens elected and they
[01:49:28.960 --> 01:49:33.440]  admit that it's illegal aliens voting and the feds say they deserve to vote I
[01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:39.720]  mean you cannot make up stuff this insane this is a criminal government again
[01:49:39.720 --> 01:49:43.320]  I'm not against the illegal aliens folks but the government has brought them in
[01:49:43.320 --> 01:49:49.120]  as a political weapon to displace the American people and to vote for the
[01:49:49.120 --> 01:49:55.920]  robbery against the people and I mean it's just it's treason we have a
[01:49:55.920 --> 01:50:01.240]  treasonous government and to watch that senator beat up some college students
[01:50:01.240 --> 01:50:06.080]  literally punch their camera grab them the the young men are polite the entire
[01:50:06.080 --> 01:50:10.440]  time and then I've got the MSNBC Chris Matthews piece and other shows seeing how
[01:50:10.440 --> 01:50:16.240]  dare them attack the senator but that's look that's the way it works now cops
[01:50:16.240 --> 01:50:19.880]  attack you you get charged with attacking them even if there's video of the
[01:50:19.880 --> 01:50:23.920]  cops hitting you you don't touch them they show it to a jury and they say
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:29.680]  police are God and the jury says police are God and you go to prison and now of
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:34.520]  the senator beats you rapes your wife they will say your wife raped them I
[01:50:34.520 --> 01:50:40.840]  mean and I'm not being sarcastic about that government is God in a tyranny and
[01:50:40.840 --> 01:50:45.200]  good points Ernie Wayne David truth master mark I'm gonna go to you quickly
[01:50:45.200 --> 01:50:49.160]  on the other side there's so much news coming up I want to get into all these
[01:50:49.160 --> 01:50:52.600]  professors and government officials talking about the end of the world and
[01:50:52.600 --> 01:50:57.080]  NASA saying you know the Sun could kill us and and all this hype and humanity
[01:50:57.080 --> 01:51:01.760]  will be extinct they're hyping it why are they hyping it normal blood pressure

[01:54:36.000 --> 01:54:42.360]  thank you for it I want to move quickly I want to ask you to or make a suggestion
[01:54:42.360 --> 01:54:51.200]  that your listeners search Edward Mandel house and what he has to say it's very
[01:54:51.200 --> 01:54:56.600]  informative and and interesting to see what he had to say yeah house called
[01:54:56.600 --> 01:55:00.920]  a house park here in Austin he was from Austin he was the handler of Woodrow
[01:55:00.920 --> 01:55:04.760]  Wilson openly said we're gonna have a new British Empire planetary government
[01:55:04.760 --> 01:55:09.360]  and bankrupt the American people through taxation and he wrote books about it
[01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:13.640]  bragging about how they destroy America and now they've done it yes and if you
[01:55:13.640 --> 01:55:20.960]  just Google Edward Mandel house has to say or any search engine it's a really
[01:55:20.960 --> 01:55:26.400]  brief read and it'll tell you how forever to remain economic slaves this
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:32.360]  applies to the world not only to to the United States we're all corporations if
[01:55:32.360 --> 01:55:36.720]  you could Google that maybe you could read it and my second point is I want to
[01:55:36.720 --> 01:55:41.680]  I want to go to the Bilderberg Bilderberg meeting of this year in
[01:55:41.680 --> 01:55:47.320]  June of 2000 and the list of it and ask the people in the corporation of
[01:55:47.320 --> 01:55:54.240]  British Columbia to go to that list and see down to the 17th name of that list
[01:55:54.240 --> 01:56:00.840]  is Gordon Campbell Premier of British Columbia and I ask all people within the
[01:56:00.840 --> 01:56:05.960]  corporation of the province of British Columbia to go to their local MLA's and
[01:56:05.960 --> 01:56:13.120]  ask what our so-called elected representative Gordon Campbell was doing
[01:56:13.120 --> 01:56:20.080]  at this Bilderberg meeting and what good for the people of the people elected by
[01:56:20.080 --> 01:56:25.360]  the people he was acquiring at this meeting well it's just like most of your
[01:56:25.360 --> 01:56:30.080]  past prime ministers he's being vetted to be prime minister in the future just
[01:56:30.080 --> 01:56:34.000]  like Tony Blair just like Barack Obama just like Bill Clinton just like George
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:39.640]  Bush senior just like the governor of Texas Rick Perry you know they've got
[01:56:39.640 --> 01:56:43.320]  different political affiliations different political coloration but
[01:56:43.320 --> 01:56:47.800]  they're all New World Order criminal trash I appreciate your call Wayne I
[01:56:47.800 --> 01:56:52.960]  really do good points that you made of course don't forget in Canada what this
[01:56:52.960 --> 01:56:57.600]  year and two years before that your parliament trying to actually be a
[01:56:57.600 --> 01:57:02.840]  parliament and try to actually cut taxes and the queen exercised her governor
[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:06.720]  generals veto and disbanded the authority of the parliament just like
[01:57:06.720 --> 01:57:10.800]  this happened in Australia you run absolutely nothing and we run nothing
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:16.080]  here our Congress is ceremonial to the Federal Reserve and the Congress is
[01:57:16.080 --> 01:57:20.800]  trying to become effective again and audit the Fed and so the Fed threatens
[01:57:20.800 --> 01:57:26.440]  financial terror and plunged the market a thousand points that day we're gonna go
[01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:32.360]  to break here and come back with David truth master Mark Scott and others and
[01:57:32.360 --> 01:57:37.160]  then after I actually go to Scott first he disagrees we'll see if it's like all
[01:57:37.160 --> 01:57:40.400]  the other people that disagree though I think you're a great patriot but I
[01:57:40.400 --> 01:57:44.040]  really love to hear somebody that actually disagree but had real meat and
[01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:53.120]  potatoes in fact if you really do disagree 1-800-259-9231 and I'm gonna go
[01:57:53.120 --> 01:57:56.480]  through the news as well we do have two guests coming up Lindsay Williams the
[01:57:56.480 --> 01:57:59.640]  last hour today people want to hear a part two interview and they say he was on
[01:57:59.640 --> 01:58:04.840]  coast-to-coast after he was here and talked about people wouldn't believe it
[01:58:04.840 --> 01:58:07.760]  if they knew who controlled our military according to his well-company
[01:58:07.760 --> 01:58:12.560]  connections that I know are real and so we'll get him to flesh that out whether
[01:58:12.560 --> 01:58:16.880]  it's coming up the last hour today you want him you got him but in closing I

[01:58:52.640 --> 01:58:57.080]  consider buying a solar power generator number one new climate legislation could
[01:58:57.080 --> 01:59:01.080]  easily double or triple your electric bill number two our new energies are
[01:59:01.080 --> 01:59:05.040]  wants to control how much power your electric company allows you to have it's
[01:59:05.040 --> 01:59:09.040]  true total government control of electricity in the name of smart grid
[01:59:09.040 --> 01:59:13.600]  technology is coming number three in some areas of the country the power grid is
[01:59:13.600 --> 01:59:17.600]  dangerously overloaded and now new socialist legislation is only
[01:59:17.600 --> 01:59:21.400]  compounding the problem number four dangerous weather is always a threat to
[01:59:21.400 --> 01:59:25.040]  local grids every year thousands of families lose their power from weather
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:29.360]  related onages number five a solar power generator provides powerful backup

[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:30.600]  today and it's very important but so are your calls Scott in California says
[02:01:30.600 --> 02:01:34.800]  that he disagrees so Scott you go to the headline go ahead
[02:01:34.800 --> 02:01:40.600]  hey man I I called because I wanted to give you grief actually about what I
[02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:45.320]  consider you to be dropping the ball and that is you know we've been hearing
[02:01:45.320 --> 02:01:51.800]  hours and hours of broadcast about image protection with this MSNBC special but
[02:01:51.800 --> 02:01:55.800]  with all of the info wars infrastructure and you being in close
[02:01:55.800 --> 02:01:59.520]  proximity you have not covered what is unfolding to be one of the biggest
[02:01:59.520 --> 02:02:04.280]  stories of our lifetime in the Gulf and you could be down there doing so much
[02:02:04.280 --> 02:02:09.960]  justice and here we are just hearing total image you know protection and it's
[02:02:09.960 --> 02:02:13.840]  getting it you know I'm wondering what are you doing why are you diverting from
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:19.320]  this enormous story well Scott I mean we've had a lot of guests on the people
[02:02:19.320 --> 02:02:24.360]  from Louisiana on I've gotten hundreds of emails saying why aren't I reporting
[02:02:24.360 --> 02:02:28.160]  that 40 million people are being evacuated and there's gun confiscation
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:32.360]  going on because it's not true I mean I made it is that what you're talking about
[02:02:32.360 --> 02:02:37.160]  well what I'm talking about is with Alex with your infrastructure my you
[02:02:37.160 --> 02:02:42.560]  hold on a minute put him on hold my infrastructure I mean I'm here just
[02:02:42.560 --> 02:02:45.440]  trying to keep the websites up under the traffic they're getting I'm here
[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:49.880]  trying to pay the bills I'm not that big I've got about 20 employees and
[02:02:49.880 --> 02:02:54.960]  contractors and I spend most my time trying to raise the money just to run
[02:02:54.960 --> 02:03:00.640]  the infrastructure you say one of the biggest stories ever I mean we know
[02:03:00.640 --> 02:03:05.400]  that they're telling the media don't be on the beach I just sent two guys for
[02:03:05.400 --> 02:03:09.960]  four or five days to Chicago where they're having the army work with local
[02:03:09.960 --> 02:03:18.000]  police in door-to-door drills that was in the television and MSNBC articles so
[02:03:18.000 --> 02:03:23.200]  that to me was not getting attention it was a few articles about literal gun
[02:03:23.200 --> 02:03:29.080]  confiscation drills and I barely had the money to send the guys to Chicago for
[02:03:29.080 --> 02:03:34.000]  four days I mean it's not in our budget and you're saying get down to the gulf
[02:03:34.000 --> 02:03:37.680]  well you know what I'd love to go to the gulf and be down there by the beach and
[02:03:37.680 --> 02:03:41.120]  be able to have the wanderlust satisfied and look at a bunch of oil and some
[02:03:41.120 --> 02:03:44.800]  dead dolphins and have some guys run up and say get off the beach and you know
[02:03:44.800 --> 02:03:51.120]  upload it to YouTube and get a million views I think it's a diversion it's a
[02:03:51.120 --> 02:03:53.840]  horrible thing that's happening Scott I'm gonna go back to you so hang up I
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:57.720]  think it's a horrible thing that's happening down there but compared to the
[02:03:57.720 --> 02:04:01.520]  UN about to vote the Congress about to vote for an embargo and to board
[02:04:01.520 --> 02:04:05.920]  Iranian ships that leave their country saying they're not allowed to have any
[02:04:05.920 --> 02:04:09.600]  trade that's an act of war and Israel saying they're getting ready for World
[02:04:09.600 --> 02:04:12.560]  War three and to launch nukes you know that's in the times of London
[02:04:12.560 --> 02:04:19.280]  Associated Press nuclear war is a lot bigger than 50 million barrels or
[02:04:19.280 --> 02:04:23.200]  whatever it is 50 million gallons excuse me not 50 million barrels well that'd
[02:04:23.200 --> 02:04:30.160]  be worse 50 million gallons of oil in the gulf so number one I mean I don't
[02:04:30.160 --> 02:04:35.000]  like to be praised and we're gonna go to break come back to you Scott I don't
[02:04:35.000 --> 02:04:37.600]  like people calling them with a great job I'm doing because I'm doing my duty and
[02:04:37.600 --> 02:04:42.920]  I am actually self-critical and I'm always trying to do a better job but
[02:04:42.920 --> 02:04:48.440]  conversely I don't like being criticized about what I need to do you know I
[02:04:48.440 --> 02:04:52.920]  cover the oil spill probably an hour or more a day total today even more we got

[02:08:07.840 --> 02:08:16.760]  continues it's Alex Jones and the GCN radio network okay you just joined us
[02:08:16.760 --> 02:08:22.800]  Scott in California called in and said you're not covering the oil spill the
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:29.040]  biggest story ever which I resent that's not true we've been covering it and all
[02:08:29.040 --> 02:08:33.800]  you're doing is image control no I mean we probably spent 30 minutes yesterday
[02:08:33.800 --> 02:08:38.840]  on the chris matthews thing probably five minutes today mentioning that people
[02:08:38.840 --> 02:08:43.800]  are calling for a boycott of MSNBC MSNBC coming out and saying that if you call
[02:08:43.800 --> 02:08:49.520]  government takeover of health care bad you're a racist and implying that anybody
[02:08:49.520 --> 02:08:54.160]  who's against world government is going to carry out terror attacks that is the
[02:08:54.160 --> 02:09:00.520]  whole homeland security set up to frame the American people ahead of stage terror
[02:09:00.520 --> 02:09:06.280]  attacks but it really sounds like a red herring to me Scott that you're calling
[02:09:06.280 --> 02:09:10.760]  in telling me that I'm not covering the oil spill when I've covered it a lot
[02:09:10.760 --> 02:09:16.280]  more than been really anything else lately and I I think overall the
[02:09:16.280 --> 02:09:20.920]  situation with Iran is much more important Scott did you hear me earlier
[02:09:20.920 --> 02:09:24.160]  read that the Iranians we have an info wars.com article curtain Emma wrote
[02:09:24.160 --> 02:09:30.840]  linking to the Iranian government's announcements on press TV that if the UN
[02:09:30.840 --> 02:09:35.960]  goes ahead with its fourth round of sanctions which includes a blockade of
[02:09:35.960 --> 02:09:40.040]  Iranian ships coming and going that that's an act of war and they're gonna
[02:09:40.040 --> 02:09:44.840]  start boarding other people's vessels I mean really I think that's the biggest
[02:09:44.840 --> 02:09:50.200]  issue it's secondarily I think the world economic implosion going on with the
[02:09:50.200 --> 02:09:55.520]  central banks looting us and then foisting this this unpayable debt on
[02:09:55.520 --> 02:10:00.240]  our backs is big I happen to know there have been bigger oil spills in the
[02:10:00.240 --> 02:10:06.840]  Middle East in in their gulfs and bigger oil spills in Indonesia and one as big
[02:10:06.840 --> 02:10:12.920]  a few years ago in the gulf in Mexico the media is hyping this I I do think it's
[02:10:12.920 --> 02:10:16.400]  a false flag I think all the evidence I've gone over to here but to mention
[02:10:16.400 --> 02:10:22.560]  and I better repeat it you've got BP CEO dumping with 33 or more percent of
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:26.600]  their stock you've got Goldman Sachs being the co-chair of BP when this
[02:10:26.600 --> 02:10:32.200]  happened you've got them dumping 44% and then more in a in a second sale the day
[02:10:32.200 --> 02:10:37.160]  of but in the month before and up to two days before dumping 44% a record
[02:10:37.160 --> 02:10:41.240]  amount just on that oil company yeah BP being a top globalist company that's
[02:10:41.240 --> 02:10:46.160]  invested tens of billions of dollars in global carbon taxes you have Obama
[02:10:46.160 --> 02:10:50.240]  blocking the local communities from protecting their estuaries in the two
[02:10:50.240 --> 02:10:54.520]  weeks they had to get the systems up blocking the Dutch and the Norwegians
[02:10:54.520 --> 02:10:57.640]  and others with their big mega scammers that they had in the area that could have
[02:10:57.640 --> 02:11:01.480]  really mitigated things stopping an immediate burn-off at the site they're
[02:11:01.480 --> 02:11:05.160]  now igniting a flare they think will burn about 10% of it they've got another
[02:11:05.160 --> 02:11:09.400]  mitigation they think about 30% of it so that cuts it by 40% they should have
[02:11:09.400 --> 02:11:13.320]  immediately torched it and let the thing on fire then you would have just had you
[02:11:13.320 --> 02:11:19.760]  know the carbon dioxide off-gassing but and I'm not an oil expert I just go to
[02:11:19.760 --> 02:11:23.520]  what the experts have always done and did immediate research on those subjects
[02:11:23.520 --> 02:11:28.400]  so what else am I supposed to do I mean coming up in T-minus 49 minutes we got
[02:11:28.400 --> 02:11:34.080]  Lindsey Williams on you know going over this more I just think with everything
[02:11:34.080 --> 02:11:38.320]  going on in the world you know I'm not the bad guy here Scott I mean what do I
[02:11:38.320 --> 02:11:44.920]  do send two guys to the coast or or not do my radio show and walk away from
[02:11:44.920 --> 02:11:49.000]  something that reaches millions of people and and and and go to the coast and
[02:11:49.000 --> 02:11:53.280]  show a dead dolphin and have some BP guys walk up and say get out of here get
[02:11:53.280 --> 02:11:57.680]  off my coastline and go file a complaint that my rights are being violated I
[02:11:57.680 --> 02:12:02.960]  mean Scott I mean tell me how to do it because I do need advice but I don't
[02:12:02.960 --> 02:12:07.080]  think I should be criticized you know because I can't do everything sir I
[02:12:07.080 --> 02:12:11.240]  I'm you know tonight my son calls me every day at about four or five and says
[02:12:11.240 --> 02:12:16.800]  daddy are you coming home and and I tell him no and last night daddy didn't come
[02:12:16.800 --> 02:12:21.600]  home until about 10 and tonight daddy didn't come home to maybe midnight I'm
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:25.640]  working on a film I mean I don't know how I run websites make business decisions
[02:12:25.640 --> 02:12:30.360]  on what to fund what not to find deal with employee issues deal with my own
[02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:35.080]  household my children deal with making films doing a radio show four hours a
[02:12:35.080 --> 02:12:40.520]  day I turned out all these magazine newspaper and radio interviews I mean
[02:12:40.520 --> 02:12:46.480]  turned out I mean explain to me Scott how I can do more for you well it
[02:12:46.480 --> 02:12:50.960]  actually it's not more for me and let's dialogue you will you'll get
[02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:55.080]  information that it doesn't even pan out that right you'll run up to Hardin
[02:12:55.080 --> 02:13:01.200]  Montana in 24-hour notice you'll report that FEMA's using outhouses to beat
[02:13:01.200 --> 02:13:06.040]  people because somebody told you but this is a whole lot of money I never said
[02:13:06.040 --> 02:13:11.160]  FEMA's using outhouses to beat people making a little joke like you would but
[02:13:11.160 --> 02:13:14.600]  my point is just like the whole the post office thing that's what I'm talking
[02:13:14.600 --> 02:13:18.560]  about anyhow the point is is this yesterday wait a minute wait a minute the
[02:13:18.560 --> 02:13:24.600]  post office is expanding these little secret prisons I know it has dual use
[02:13:24.600 --> 02:13:30.880]  for postal inspector investigations with employees and to surveil the people
[02:13:30.880 --> 02:13:38.280]  down on the on the shipping floor but there is a program to use the post
[02:13:38.280 --> 02:13:43.760]  offices as emergency forced inoculation centers as part of the model health
[02:13:43.760 --> 02:13:48.000]  emergency powers act and because let me go over each thing you're saying here
[02:13:48.000 --> 02:13:53.680]  because this isn't true there is a program to use these post offices and
[02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:59.040]  with the Hardin Montana situation the same companies now in Texas we had an
[02:13:59.040 --> 02:14:02.080]  article about this two weeks ago trying to get other municipalities to build
[02:14:02.080 --> 02:14:06.800]  more private prisons that guy was a felon up there running that there were
[02:14:06.800 --> 02:14:12.120]  blueprints that said alien detention center they did want to use it that was
[02:14:12.120 --> 02:14:17.000]  on seeing in to hold people from Camp X-ray they did have police on the side
[02:14:17.000 --> 02:14:22.320]  of their vehicles and so I went and checked into that because we didn't know
[02:14:22.320 --> 02:14:27.920]  and I wanted to be there to see exactly what was happening we know what's going
[02:14:27.920 --> 02:14:32.880]  on in the Gulf we've we've had reporters on that we trust radio talk show host
[02:14:32.880 --> 02:14:39.600]  and others that live down there we know what's going on in the Gulf okay so I
[02:14:39.600 --> 02:14:46.240]  mean that's it that that doesn't make sense am I on yeah you're on Scott okay
[02:14:46.240 --> 02:14:52.720]  excellent Alex seriously this is everybody from the esoteric to the scientific
[02:14:52.720 --> 02:14:57.280]  are talking about the global implications of this you do have the
[02:14:57.280 --> 02:15:01.560]  media is hyping the little believing that I put him on hold again I'm not gonna
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:05.240]  get up here people with two weeks been telling me say they're evacuating 40
[02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:09.480]  million people say there's martial law the whole country's under a form of
[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:15.320]  martial law I'm just not gonna report that okay and and you say the esoteric
[02:15:15.320 --> 02:15:20.960]  okay let me read I mean let's do what you want here wormwood is the Greek is
[02:15:20.960 --> 02:15:24.320]  a star or angel that appears in the biblical New Testament book of
[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:29.160]  Revelation and wormwood falls into the ocean and it's mentioned in Deuteronomy
[02:15:29.160 --> 02:15:35.200]  Jeremiah and a bunch of other places interpretations of Revelation 810 here
[02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:41.160]  and of course no one in six months will say that okay you were right it wasn't
[02:15:41.160 --> 02:15:46.200]  the end of the world and it didn't kill a third of the entire ocean on the
[02:15:46.200 --> 02:15:51.880]  world okay no one it'll just be Alex is bad he's covering up wormwood so here
[02:15:51.880 --> 02:15:57.360]  okay it's the end of the world and and and when wormwood a star fell and and
[02:15:57.360 --> 02:16:01.960]  and hit the oil platform and it's just and let's have some Nostradamus some
[02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:08.320]  vague Nostradamus here for you you know let's go ahead and read over this for
[02:16:08.320 --> 02:16:12.200]  people here let's get into this for people
[02:16:12.200 --> 02:16:20.360]  futurist interpretations and then it gets into the oil spill and wormwood this
[02:16:20.360 --> 02:16:26.040]  from the christian-forum net it says in the last days or should we look worse
[02:16:26.040 --> 02:16:30.640]  things to happen Revelation 8 5 the angel took the canister and filled it
[02:16:30.640 --> 02:16:35.040]  with fire of the altar and cast it into the earth and there were voices and
[02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:38.820]  thunderings and lightnings in an earthquake six and seven angels which
[02:16:38.820 --> 02:16:42.320]  had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound and people say look
[02:16:42.320 --> 02:16:48.720]  there were earthquakes in Haiti and Chile so that means no there's always
[02:16:48.720 --> 02:16:55.120]  earthquakes I mean I just go off what I can prove here okay the first angel
[02:16:55.120 --> 02:17:01.160]  sounded and there were followed a hail and fire mingle with blood so hail and
[02:17:01.160 --> 02:17:04.960]  fire is falling and blood sounds like nuclear war to me doesn't sound like an
[02:17:04.960 --> 02:17:10.560]  oil rig the first angel no if they attack Iran this may end up happening but
[02:17:10.560 --> 02:17:15.240]  I'm not supposed to talk about that I'm supposed to the esoteric says Alex the
[02:17:15.240 --> 02:17:20.320]  first angel sounded and there were hail and fire mingle with blood and they were
[02:17:20.320 --> 02:17:25.240]  cast upon the earth and the third part of trees was burned up a third part of
[02:17:25.240 --> 02:17:29.800]  the earth's trees were burned up well that has that happened and all green
[02:17:29.800 --> 02:17:34.240]  grass was burned up and the second angel sounded and it was with a great
[02:17:34.240 --> 02:17:38.960]  mountain burning and fire was cast into the sea so they say oh look at Iceland
[02:17:38.960 --> 02:17:43.120]  now that that just happened and the third part of the sea became blood and the
[02:17:43.120 --> 02:17:46.560]  third part of the creatures that were in the sea and had life died and the third
[02:17:46.560 --> 02:17:50.320]  part of the ships were destroyed a third of the animals aren't dead a third of
[02:17:50.320 --> 02:17:54.320]  the ships aren't destroyed verse 10 and the third angel sounded and there fell
[02:17:54.320 --> 02:17:59.600]  a great star from heaven burning as it were a lamp an asteroid folks and it
[02:17:59.600 --> 02:18:03.240]  fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters and
[02:18:03.240 --> 02:18:07.400]  11 and the name of the stars called wormwood and the third part of the
[02:18:07.400 --> 02:18:11.640]  waters came at wormwood and many men died of the waters because they were
[02:18:11.640 --> 02:18:17.000]  bitter and the fourth angel sounded now now now what kind of star can fall
[02:18:17.000 --> 02:18:24.440]  hydrogen bomb nuclear radiation fallout contaminating the water and the fourth
[02:18:24.440 --> 02:18:28.480]  angel sounded and the third part of the sun was smitten the third part of the
[02:18:28.480 --> 02:18:32.400]  moon a third part of the stars so the third part of them was darkened and the
[02:18:32.400 --> 02:18:37.200]  day show not for part of it and the night likewise 13 I beheld and heard an
[02:18:37.200 --> 02:18:41.080]  angel flying through the mist of heaven saying with a loud voice whoa whoa whoa
[02:18:41.080 --> 02:18:45.240]  like you're in deep trouble buddy to the inhabitants of the earth by reason of
[02:18:45.240 --> 02:18:52.520]  other voices of the trumpet the three angels which are yet to sound I mean
[02:18:52.520 --> 02:18:57.680]  this is not the end of the world with this oil leaking okay what is it you
[02:18:57.680 --> 02:19:03.680]  don't understand there have been beggar oil leaks in the ocean before it is not
[02:19:03.680 --> 02:19:09.800]  good but they are not evacuating 40 million people that is not happening
[02:19:09.800 --> 02:19:15.880]  okay that is not going on that is not happening we're not covering that up
[02:19:15.880 --> 02:19:21.120]  wormwood is not falling a third of the earth's men are not dying right now a
[02:19:21.120 --> 02:19:27.160]  poison a third of the trees and all the grass is not burned up a third of the
[02:19:27.160 --> 02:19:34.720]  ships are not destroyed a third of the life in the ocean is not dead the media
[02:19:34.720 --> 02:19:39.200]  is hyping this as a diversion just like Edward 9-11 that's all it was on the
[02:19:39.200 --> 02:19:42.520]  news for four or five months that's all anybody would talk about while they were
[02:19:42.520 --> 02:19:47.080]  busy taking over stay there Scott I'm gonna have you continue here and I'm
[02:19:47.080 --> 02:19:50.280]  gonna spend much more time with you though okay you mean you're on the air

[02:19:54.560 --> 02:20:01.680]  us about what it is we must know about this stupid BP oil leak this is Alex
[02:20:01.680 --> 02:20:05.320]  Jones with five good reasons you should consider buying a solar power generator
[02:20:05.320 --> 02:20:09.520]  number one new climate legislation could easily double or triple your electric
[02:20:09.520 --> 02:20:13.800]  bill number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your
[02:20:13.800 --> 02:20:17.800]  electric company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[02:20:17.800 --> 02:20:22.120]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[02:20:22.120 --> 02:20:26.440]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[02:20:26.440 --> 02:20:30.200]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[02:20:30.200 --> 02:20:34.320]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[02:20:34.320 --> 02:20:38.280]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar power
[02:20:38.280 --> 02:20:42.120]  generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[02:20:42.120 --> 02:20:44.840]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from
[02:20:44.840 --> 02:20:50.840]  science one of my old sponsors you can get more information at www.mysolarbackup.com
[02:20:50.840 --> 02:20:55.480]  that's my solar backup.com remember the government doesn't own the sun so go to

[02:24:31.560 --> 02:24:34.880]  people like Richard Hogan is talking about the enormous gas bubble that
[02:24:34.880 --> 02:24:39.560]  they're seeing you got questions about the czar's questions about the
[02:24:39.560 --> 02:24:43.480]  correct set every all the dispersants that they're throwing down there's so
[02:24:43.480 --> 02:24:47.800]  much about this story that only the alternative media has been telling and
[02:24:47.800 --> 02:24:52.080]  you who allegedly has the biggest footprint in the alternative media has
[02:24:52.080 --> 02:24:55.880]  been talking about Chris Matthews nobody a year from now is going to be worried
[02:24:55.880 --> 02:24:59.920]  about that MSNBC piece that was done but when all those people all your
[02:24:59.920 --> 02:25:03.320]  listeners down in the South are going to be wondering where was Alex Jones an
[02:25:03.320 --> 02:25:08.240]  American reporter where was he why was he talking about other things and
[02:25:08.240 --> 02:25:13.800]  diverting away from a story about something well Scott this is a hoax I
[02:25:13.800 --> 02:25:22.960]  mean I mean you you ought to go work for MSNBC yourself it's a hoax and they're
[02:25:22.960 --> 02:25:26.800]  going to wonder where was Alex on the Gulf oil spill talking about it
[02:25:26.800 --> 02:25:32.000]  probably more than I should have that we've been talking about it for 25
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:35.440]  minutes with you I was talking about it in the first hour I was talking about
[02:25:35.440 --> 02:25:39.560]  it in the last hour it's just it's just I shouldn't have spent so much time with
[02:25:39.560 --> 02:25:44.000]  Scott it's just when you talk to somebody who doesn't hear anything you
[02:25:44.000 --> 02:25:47.640]  say I just talked about dispersants I'm talking to Lindsay Williams about it
[02:25:47.640 --> 02:25:56.600]  next hour that was just bizarre just bizarre very strange very very strange
[02:25:56.600 --> 02:26:03.280]  David in South Carolina sorry to have you hold that long go ahead are you there
[02:26:03.280 --> 02:26:07.720]  Alex yes sir go ahead and turn that radio off oh it's computer that's how I
[02:26:07.720 --> 02:26:10.160]  listen to you I understand but I can hear the
[02:26:10.160 --> 02:26:17.600]  controller yeah I can hear him my question not about the Gulf or Iran and my
[02:26:17.600 --> 02:26:23.720]  question is about well Obama instructed the UN ambassador to vote on global
[02:26:23.720 --> 02:26:30.600]  gun control treaty and that goes to show you right here Alex while Obama got
[02:26:30.600 --> 02:26:37.120]  playing you might well say he already had defaced our Constitution hold on David
[02:26:37.120 --> 02:26:41.520]  according to Scott I need to hang up on you right now we can't talk about Obama
[02:26:41.520 --> 02:26:46.600]  supporting a global gun ban treaty with the UN which does directly threaten our
[02:26:46.600 --> 02:26:50.560]  Second Amendment or our Attorney General who says we have no right to own guns
[02:26:50.560 --> 02:26:57.320]  David you only can talk about the Gulf I'm sorry I'm sorry David I got to let
[02:26:57.320 --> 02:27:04.200]  you go okay we're only where was David where was Alex when the UN was passing a
[02:27:04.200 --> 02:27:08.040]  treaty to ban our guns well we were talking about the oil spill sorry David
[02:27:08.040 --> 02:27:11.320]  no no I appreciate your call David that is important we have talked about it and
[02:27:11.320 --> 02:27:15.760]  let's get Larry Pratt on next week I know that'll make Scott mad but let's get
[02:27:15.760 --> 02:27:19.520]  Larry Pratt on next week for about 30 minutes about the UN treaty that's very
[02:27:19.520 --> 02:27:24.480]  serious it also shows us the intent of the White House truth master you're on
[02:27:24.480 --> 02:27:30.240]  the air better be about the oil spill go ahead okay well first of all this oil
[02:27:30.240 --> 02:27:35.440]  spills nonsense is exactly what that is it's nonsense I can tell you that back
[02:27:35.440 --> 02:27:40.680]  in the 70s I think it was 72 the exact same thing happened they tried the exact
[02:27:40.680 --> 02:27:45.840]  same procedures they didn't call it top hat they called it operation sombrero
[02:27:45.840 --> 02:27:49.920]  they tried the top fill they tried all of that stuff the only thing that worked
[02:27:49.920 --> 02:27:54.720]  was drilling in it and it's in it gushed uncontrollably for 90 days exact
[02:27:54.720 --> 02:27:58.680]  same thing happened right there in the Gulf everybody forgot about that but the
[02:27:58.680 --> 02:28:02.600]  media made a huge deal about it back then as well it's just a distraction because
[02:28:02.600 --> 02:28:07.920]  they know something that's like a ticking clock that's day-to-day is a soap opera
[02:28:07.920 --> 02:28:12.400]  just like Chandra Levy before the globalist carried out 9-11 and here
[02:28:12.400 --> 02:28:16.440]  they are lining the aircraft carriers the missiles up getting ready to board the
[02:28:16.440 --> 02:28:21.480]  Iranian ships Iran says this means war Israel's going on board ships you know
[02:28:21.480 --> 02:28:23.840]  the globalists are trying to do everything they can to start World War
[02:28:23.840 --> 02:28:29.360]  3 and when people say where was Alex when World War 3 was being set up I was
[02:28:29.360 --> 02:28:33.040]  here covering it you know it's kind of like two months three months before the
[02:28:33.040 --> 02:28:37.120]  flu thing started I said they're gearing up for flu hype I don't know if it's
[02:28:37.120 --> 02:28:40.680]  going to be real or if it's going to be staged but they're getting ready for
[02:28:40.680 --> 02:28:45.320]  martial law and I had government documents I had eyewitnesses and then I
[02:28:45.320 --> 02:28:51.920]  got accused by the Cointel Pro of fear mongering about the flu when I was the
[02:28:51.920 --> 02:28:59.040]  one saying it was a hoax now that's mind control isn't it it is and see the
[02:28:59.040 --> 02:29:03.400]  thing is that as a truth master I go around and I wake up as many people as
[02:29:03.400 --> 02:29:08.880]  I can typically I get on average 20 to 30 people a year now I can tell you that
[02:29:08.880 --> 02:29:11.920]  all of these people that are just roaming around that are just got their
[02:29:11.920 --> 02:29:15.320]  heads buried in the sand are talking about this Gulf oil spill it's I mean
[02:29:15.320 --> 02:29:18.920]  people at work everywhere and they're saying something's got to be done and
[02:29:18.920 --> 02:29:24.360]  the media is saying Obama's getting tough with a new tax they're gonna tax us
[02:29:24.360 --> 02:29:30.560]  instead of going after BP and I but the the other thing is truth master is I
[02:29:30.560 --> 02:29:34.680]  feel guilty I've been spending too much time on the stinking spill you give me
[02:29:34.680 --> 02:29:40.160]  your vote am I spending too much time not enough time or just right on the
[02:29:40.160 --> 02:29:44.440]  issue I say you've been in too much time on it and I had one other point I wanted
[02:29:44.440 --> 02:29:48.400]  to cover stay there though but it better be on the oil spill they're right

[02:32:55.880 --> 02:33:08.880]  1-877-327-0365 yep coming to you from a little place called Texas
[02:33:13.880 --> 02:33:20.000]  thank you for joining us ladies and gentlemen all right look I need to get
[02:33:20.000 --> 02:33:23.080]  into more of the news and then we've got Lindsay Williams coming up to cover the
[02:33:23.080 --> 02:33:29.560]  oil spill but it's like an oxymoron when somebody criticizes me for something
[02:33:29.560 --> 02:33:32.760]  that isn't real it's like it gets stuck in my head and then I'll get hundreds of
[02:33:32.760 --> 02:33:36.000]  emails saying why did you have that idiot on that long it just it just it
[02:33:36.000 --> 02:33:40.080]  just really frustrates me because I cover what I think is important and that
[02:33:40.080 --> 02:33:43.280]  doesn't mean I'm always right but I've been doing this longer than most people
[02:33:43.280 --> 02:33:49.000]  and I've got a pretty good record of being spot-on but it's my radio show I
[02:33:49.000 --> 02:33:53.240]  mean you know I'm not bad I'm not the one sitting the IRS after you to take
[02:33:53.240 --> 02:33:57.200]  your property I'm not the one launching the new wars I'm not the offshore banks
[02:33:57.200 --> 02:34:00.880]  selling derivatives to our government and creating a debt black hole it's
[02:34:00.880 --> 02:34:04.960]  impossible to pay back I'm simply somebody here trying to get people
[02:34:04.960 --> 02:34:09.640]  motivated to take action to be leaders in their own right but so many times in
[02:34:09.640 --> 02:34:13.600]  history the people that get smashed are the ones that stand up against the evil
[02:34:13.600 --> 02:34:17.720]  you know the crowd says no we don't like you for telling us about the problem
[02:34:17.720 --> 02:34:21.880]  you didn't tell us about it right now I want to get into Iran threatens to stop
[02:34:21.880 --> 02:34:27.760]  Western ships if subjected to cargo inspection this is big news I know the
[02:34:27.760 --> 02:34:31.160]  media isn't talking about it every five minutes and saying something must be done
[02:34:31.160 --> 02:34:36.200]  and you know oh and the media cares so much about the public and what's Obama
[02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:40.280]  gonna do and everyone feels like they've been wronged and gets all angry
[02:34:40.280 --> 02:34:44.600]  because the TV tells you so but they don't tell you to get mad at the bankers
[02:34:44.600 --> 02:34:48.800]  they don't tell you to get mad at the military industrial complex that wants
[02:34:48.800 --> 02:34:54.080]  to pass laws to secretly arrest you and be able to torture you no no no no no
[02:34:54.080 --> 02:34:58.480]  no all the big issues we're not supposed to be upset about we're all whipped up
[02:34:58.480 --> 02:35:04.400]  into this big fury which is much ado about nothing and we've also got Bruno
[02:35:04.400 --> 02:35:09.380]  Brewwiler who I've talked to been a guest on the show gave us some great
[02:35:09.380 --> 02:35:14.760]  video that we've put in some of the documentaries I've seen we are change
[02:35:14.760 --> 02:35:18.600]  Los Angeles people get beat up by the cops for having a video camera on the
[02:35:18.600 --> 02:35:25.400]  street I've seen they're the folks that went into the live program they're on
[02:35:25.400 --> 02:35:32.120]  HBO with Bill Maher they've been a lot of good work and this time well here's
[02:35:32.120 --> 02:35:37.000]  the headline we are change LA organizer faces terrorist charge and so we'll
[02:35:37.000 --> 02:35:40.480]  spend about 10 minutes with him and then go back to your calls but finishing up
[02:35:40.480 --> 02:35:47.200]  with truth master in Florida you had one other point you wanted to make truth
[02:35:47.200 --> 02:35:53.240]  master yes and I would say this is one of the most important points of the day
[02:35:53.240 --> 02:35:58.480]  in regards to the new world order that's a failed elite plan there's a true plan
[02:35:58.480 --> 02:36:04.320]  that there's no stopping that I like to refer to as the true world order and
[02:36:04.320 --> 02:36:07.400]  that is what's going to be inheriting your here coming shortly after the
[02:36:07.400 --> 02:36:13.200]  extinction of most of the lower 92% of the population and so my point I just
[02:36:13.200 --> 02:36:17.280]  wanted to put out to most people as a freemason myself you need to get
[02:36:17.280 --> 02:36:23.040]  yourselves ascended to a higher top 10% in the categories of everyone else who's
[02:36:23.040 --> 02:36:26.560]  alive right now if you can't I'm sorry but you're just not going to be able to
[02:36:26.560 --> 02:36:31.120]  make it only those people who've got their minds completely awakened and
[02:36:31.120 --> 02:36:35.280]  enlightened enlightenment is the key awakening of the egoic consciousness
[02:36:35.280 --> 02:36:40.000]  only those people who can pass those tests and those trials are going to
[02:36:40.000 --> 02:36:45.160]  survive well truth master let me let me say this the new world order system is
[02:36:45.160 --> 02:36:50.440]  that higher level freemasonic system and whether it's the earth first
[02:36:50.440 --> 02:36:56.840]  battalion at the Pentagon or any of these groups they say that that that they
[02:36:56.840 --> 02:37:01.000]  are going to purge the earth of at least 90% of us because our consciousness
[02:37:01.000 --> 02:37:04.760]  isn't right but I see these very globalists is the ones causing so many
[02:37:04.760 --> 02:37:10.280]  of our problems and so what you're saying is pure you know a new world order
[02:37:10.280 --> 02:37:16.240]  speak and I mean is this what they teach at your masonic lodge but here's the
[02:37:16.240 --> 02:37:20.560]  difference though here's where the confusion comes in the as hard as it
[02:37:20.560 --> 02:37:25.480]  may be to understand the elite of their car they're just being used and they
[02:37:25.480 --> 02:37:28.800]  think they're building their new world order and yet they're only setting up
[02:37:28.800 --> 02:37:32.640]  the true world order no I understand they're being used to test the true
[02:37:32.640 --> 02:37:36.960]  Illuminati and by them oppressing the people that will force the true humans
[02:37:36.960 --> 02:37:41.640]  to rise up and take dominion over the planet and so that the real the real
[02:37:41.640 --> 02:37:46.600]  Illuminati I mean I had you know a business a computer company owner here
[02:37:46.600 --> 02:37:50.360]  in town tell me you know Alex you know you're really the Illuminati because
[02:37:50.360 --> 02:37:56.160]  you're fighting tyranny and it's all just a hall of mirrors but I mean I
[02:37:56.160 --> 02:38:00.200]  understand that philosophy and Jesus is the brother of Lucifer and they're
[02:38:00.200 --> 02:38:05.360]  really just twins and it just goes on and on but I find the fruits of that use
[02:38:05.360 --> 02:38:10.200]  the degradation and tyranny we see today what do you say to that truth master
[02:38:10.200 --> 02:38:15.600]  that's true that's 100% true but like I said it's just I don't know how you
[02:38:15.600 --> 02:38:21.280]  would flushing out the true inheritance of seeds that were placed long ago that
[02:38:21.280 --> 02:38:28.920]  are now who do you believe Lucifer is Lucifer is the eastern star he is the
[02:38:28.920 --> 02:38:32.640]  morning star which Christ is also referred to that's where you guys get
[02:38:32.640 --> 02:38:38.640]  that that he's Lucifer guys pull up go to YouTube Mason says says he worships

[02:39:06.120 --> 02:39:13.360]  good Lucifer is a pawn himself a pawn he is also a pawn that is being used to
[02:39:13.360 --> 02:39:19.120]  corrupt these high-level people who have souls that do not have the ability to
[02:39:19.120 --> 02:39:23.320]  withstand against these tyrannies and these evils and listen I appreciate your
[02:39:23.320 --> 02:39:28.200]  call okay I'm just telling you out of that whole Masonic thing you're into
[02:39:28.200 --> 02:39:32.040]  flows this and the low-level masons they're not even aware that it's a cult
[02:39:32.040 --> 02:39:36.600]  and then people that get into the inner sanctums of Freemasonry you know they
[02:39:36.600 --> 02:39:42.760]  find out that it is Lucifer but Lucifer is really Jesus and look any religion
[02:39:42.760 --> 02:39:47.200]  where it's secret any religion where they've got an outer temple and an inner
[02:39:47.200 --> 02:39:53.920]  temple you better look out okay okay any religion where you're not allowed to know
[02:39:53.920 --> 02:39:58.600]  what's going on you know and what the secret inner priesthood is doing any
[02:39:58.600 --> 02:40:03.960]  government any system any really any governmental system that operates like
[02:40:03.960 --> 02:40:10.040]  that you better watch it okay because it's always about that inner group
[02:40:10.040 --> 02:40:15.280]  manipulating and controlling the outer group but I'm done talking about it oh
[02:40:15.280 --> 02:40:20.080]  boy let me just hit this article then we'll go to Bruno who really needs your
[02:40:20.080 --> 02:40:24.000]  help right now and I've seen this so many times it just shows the bona fide
[02:40:24.000 --> 02:40:27.360]  tyranny we're living under in this nation and I've seen it over and over again
[02:40:27.360 --> 02:40:31.360]  and we've had guests on like the guest who exposed government corruption so
[02:40:31.360 --> 02:40:35.000]  the year and a half the judge has held the gown contempt without a contempt
[02:40:35.000 --> 02:40:40.440]  hearing and has now told him you'll be in prison for life in the jail I mean you
[02:40:40.440 --> 02:40:45.760]  know just just this is tyranny take him away to the dungeon take him away you've
[02:40:45.760 --> 02:40:50.920]  done with you we'll talk to you in 30 years if you've been clapped in irons
[02:40:50.920 --> 02:40:56.600]  that will teach you rabble the respect of the crown that's basically what we're
[02:40:56.600 --> 02:41:02.360]  talking about here but but here's the big news now this to me is the big kahuna
[02:41:02.360 --> 02:41:08.360]  this is what matters Iran threatens to stop Western ships if subjected to
[02:41:08.360 --> 02:41:15.200]  cargo inspection Iran's parliament has warned it will respond in kind who
[02:41:15.200 --> 02:41:20.200]  inspections of its ships under a fourth round of sanctions imposed on the
[02:41:20.200 --> 02:41:25.320]  country by the UN Security Council a new round of sanctions are being drafted by
[02:41:25.320 --> 02:41:30.400]  the United States and the European Union we warn the US and certain
[02:41:30.400 --> 02:41:34.880]  adventurous countries that if they are tempted to inspect Iranian air and ship
[02:41:34.880 --> 02:41:38.640]  cargoes we will take tough action against their ships in the Persian Gulf
[02:41:38.640 --> 02:41:46.320]  and see of Oman said Iranian parliament speaker Ali Larjani on Wednesday
[02:41:46.320 --> 02:41:50.680]  evening Larjani said any retaliation move will be part of the country's policy
[02:41:50.680 --> 02:41:54.760]  to defend national interest according to the Fars news agency that's their main
[02:41:54.760 --> 02:42:00.120]  national publication state-owned system the Iranian parliament calls the
[02:42:00.120 --> 02:42:04.440]  government to not lessen the level of uranium enrichment below 20% since these
[02:42:04.440 --> 02:42:07.520]  countries have violated the nonproliferation treaty refused to provide
[02:42:07.520 --> 02:42:12.160]  20% enriched fuel for Tehran's research reactor got Tehran has asked for
[02:42:12.160 --> 02:42:15.960]  uranium that cannot be used in any weapon then they offered to give their
[02:42:15.960 --> 02:42:22.040]  uranium to France they said no then to Turkey no then Brazil no no first Obama
[02:42:22.040 --> 02:42:25.800]  said yeah give it to Turkey they'll enrich it to prove it in for bombs okay
[02:42:25.800 --> 02:42:29.640]  here's all our uranium no that deals off the table now we're moving nuke subs in
[02:42:29.640 --> 02:42:32.960]  an aircraft carriers we're we're gonna start boarding your ships nothing's
[02:42:32.960 --> 02:42:37.720]  allowed in they can only refine roughly half of the oil okay they have a lot of
[02:42:37.720 --> 02:42:41.600]  oil but other refinery system those are expensive I mean it's hard to build up
[02:42:41.600 --> 02:42:45.920]  in a society folks hard to build up a civilization and this isn't cheap that's
[02:42:45.920 --> 02:42:49.480]  when they blew up Belgrade it was such a problem they blow up anything with
[02:42:49.480 --> 02:42:53.760]  bombardments that's self-sufficient and so Iran's getting self-sufficient the
[02:42:53.760 --> 02:42:59.520]  globalist are like we're gonna blow the hell out of you and this will Muslims
[02:42:59.520 --> 02:43:02.720]  are gonna ride all over the world the Iranians are gonna go into Iraq
[02:43:02.720 --> 02:43:06.920]  the globalist will stage terror attacks say Iran did it and World War 3 is off
[02:43:06.920 --> 02:43:11.760]  the races and China said they may get involved and so is Russia I mean folks
[02:43:11.760 --> 02:43:16.960]  this is serious business but you know once our ships are getting hit by missiles
[02:43:16.960 --> 02:43:20.720]  and there's death the American flags are gonna go out good old boys are gonna be
[02:43:20.720 --> 02:43:25.440]  I don't care if the government's got to raise my taxes forget what happened with
[02:43:25.440 --> 02:43:34.920]  the economy we're in a war and I want to kill me an Arab oh and then you won't
[02:43:34.920 --> 02:43:38.880]  worry about Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan ripping you off you won't worry about the
[02:43:38.880 --> 02:43:42.000]  open borders the illegal aliens you won't worry about all the tyranny you
[02:43:42.000 --> 02:43:46.360]  won't worry about that because you're gonna be in a war and while they're
[02:43:46.360 --> 02:43:51.000]  getting their war ready they blew that oil cap there's every piece of evidence
[02:43:51.000 --> 02:43:56.560]  points at that as a pretext you know I love Lindsey Williams but no I don't
[02:43:56.560 --> 02:43:59.440]  think the elite knew this was coming and dump their stock as they had a Ouija
[02:43:59.440 --> 02:44:02.840]  board they knew what was coming and they dumped the stock as they pulled this
[02:44:02.840 --> 02:44:07.400]  either they ordered it to be done or the evidence is showing that for two weeks
[02:44:07.400 --> 02:44:10.560]  the people on those oil rigs were throwing fits saying look this is gonna
[02:44:10.560 --> 02:44:14.320]  blow up this has never been done this way you're not putting the semen in and
[02:44:14.320 --> 02:44:19.560]  mud you're putting them water in this is gonna blow out this is dangerous so they
[02:44:19.560 --> 02:44:23.160]  gave them orders that they knew we're gonna cause it to blow up for the
[02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:28.240]  political diversion you now see I told you 50-something days ago Obama was
[02:44:28.240 --> 02:44:32.480]  gonna call for a carbon tax to clean this up and now what's he done I mean
[02:44:32.480 --> 02:44:38.600]  come on come on the reason this oil thing is big news is the feds wouldn't
[02:44:38.600 --> 02:44:41.560]  let the states protect themselves because the feds are out of control and
[02:44:41.560 --> 02:44:48.600]  the states have been castrated why did the states follow I mean that's an issue
[02:44:48.600 --> 02:44:51.920]  for people in Louisiana, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama why are you letting your
[02:44:51.920 --> 02:44:55.760]  state houses sit there till it was too late and not put up their own booms their
[02:44:55.760 --> 02:45:01.320]  own sand berms why did you let Barack Hussein, Barry Sitaro, Obama tell you
[02:45:01.320 --> 02:45:06.240]  what to do meanwhile we're talking about this they're getting ready for
[02:45:06.240 --> 02:45:10.560]  World War three and the banks are stealing trillions a month all right I'm

[02:54:23.040 --> 02:54:32.800]  Williams at 1-800-259-9231 Bruno Brueweiler of We Are Change L.A. a great
[02:54:32.800 --> 02:54:37.040]  guy we've interviewed him four or five times in the past with news stories
[02:54:37.040 --> 02:54:40.760]  they've been working on out in Los Angeles and it's a real shame to see
[02:54:40.760 --> 02:54:45.360]  this and look I don't like bashing police but police are the enforcers for
[02:54:45.360 --> 02:54:51.720]  this out-of-control illegitimate government and more and more we've all
[02:54:51.720 --> 02:54:56.520]  seen the videos of cops just beating the daylights out of somebody and then
[02:54:56.520 --> 02:55:03.000]  setting them up and charging them with attacking the cops on video cops don't
[02:55:03.000 --> 02:55:07.400]  care you have video of them beating you up they will then say it's not enough I
[02:55:07.400 --> 02:55:12.560]  broke your nose I'm gonna charge you with assaulting me now and Bruno's got all
[02:55:12.560 --> 02:55:18.160]  these witnesses need a subpoena there's surveillance camera tapes and just don't
[02:55:18.160 --> 02:55:22.840]  plea bargain whatever you do and push it all the way to a trial and just
[02:55:22.840 --> 02:55:26.640]  literally almost wear a mask or the judge will say you're being disrespectful
[02:55:26.640 --> 02:55:31.960]  life in prison and I'm not joking about Los Angeles I mean it is just a pit of
[02:55:31.960 --> 02:55:37.840]  evil where real criminals are released citizens look it's about letting slaves
[02:55:37.840 --> 02:55:43.880]  know it's like the movie it's not ants what's the name of it about a bug's life
[02:55:43.880 --> 02:55:49.680]  where they say if we let one of those ants stand up to us they'll all stand up
[02:55:49.680 --> 02:55:56.560]  and I've seen it I mean I've experienced it and cops are now taught look
[02:55:56.560 --> 02:56:00.800]  citizens are scum it's better just to get them in the criminal justice system
[02:56:00.800 --> 02:56:05.120]  that way we get their second amendment rights that way they're in the system so
[02:56:05.120 --> 02:56:08.720]  go ahead and frame people go ahead and get them to the system this is how we
[02:56:08.720 --> 02:56:13.000]  protect America they've been taught that criminality is good now how many cops
[02:56:13.000 --> 02:56:20.600]  are bearing false witness against you there's two main ones and then probably
[02:56:20.600 --> 02:56:26.880]  a third one I should say bailiffs are these bailiffs or cops
[02:56:26.880 --> 02:56:32.400]  there cops in the court so these are these are court worshipers these are
[02:56:32.400 --> 02:56:36.400]  or Torian guard to keep you know who are there every day where kids are being

[03:00:45.440 --> 03:00:50.120]  top globalist one of them who has attended Bilderberg meetings Dr. Stan
[03:00:50.120 --> 03:00:53.400]  Monteef and I have both confirmed and and know the individual he's talking
[03:00:53.400 --> 03:00:57.680]  about we know he has the source and a lot of what he talked about a week and a
[03:00:57.680 --> 03:01:03.480]  half ago or so here on air has now come out that the leak is many many times
[03:01:03.480 --> 03:01:07.480]  worse than what they said that it is coming out of a record pressure level
[03:01:07.480 --> 03:01:12.720]  but there is an unusual amount of toxic chemicals mixed in with this oil oil
[03:01:12.720 --> 03:01:16.080]  always has quite a bit of other toxic elements in it but but this is a
[03:01:16.080 --> 03:01:20.680]  particularly nasty stuff and this may be a new strata they've gone into in this
[03:01:20.680 --> 03:01:24.680]  super deep well as they're called but I want to get him on what would just a
[03:01:24.680 --> 03:01:30.600]  brief recap of the info he covered last week and then I got a bunch of calls

[03:01:33.560 --> 03:01:37.920]  Norrie and said George if the American people knew who was in control of their
[03:01:37.920 --> 03:01:43.400]  military they would be very upset well I know the Army War College and Thomas
[03:01:43.400 --> 03:01:47.080]  Barnett and the Naval War College brags that it's totally run by offshore banks
[03:01:47.080 --> 03:01:51.560]  and the Federal Reserve I don't know if that's the intel Williams was given but

[03:08:31.960 --> 03:08:37.120]  about troops for five days of terror drill and we noticed in the actual press
[03:08:37.120 --> 03:08:40.480]  releases put out by the army that the army was going to be training with local
[03:08:40.480 --> 03:08:46.360]  police in neighborhoods to quote take on American drug dealers and gun owners

[03:08:59.760 --> 03:09:04.440]  oil spill which is important I'm looking at Iran I'm looking at military drills
[03:09:04.440 --> 03:09:10.720]  in Chicago tell folks what you witnessed it well apparently since the mid 90s the
[03:09:10.720 --> 03:09:15.920]  National Guard in Illinois has been working with Poland as like a sister
[03:09:15.920 --> 03:09:19.760]  type program so they had Polish troops they're training with the American
[03:09:19.760 --> 03:09:23.680]  troops and we actually witnessed and videotaped a terror drill where they
[03:09:23.680 --> 03:09:27.360]  had Boy Scouts as the victims and the Polish troops were dressed up as
[03:09:27.360 --> 03:09:31.080]  commandos they they said they're only to be observing but that they were actually
[03:09:31.080 --> 03:09:36.040]  participating in this event and and then we even have later on camera one of the
[03:09:36.040 --> 03:09:42.160]  city of Chicago terror officials are a emergency management official said
[03:09:42.160 --> 03:09:45.200]  they're just there observing they're just there to observe and of course in
[03:09:45.200 --> 03:09:48.800]  police state for the rise of FEMA that you did co-directed with me and Douglas
[03:09:48.800 --> 03:09:52.400]  we had the colonel we interviewed the colonel who admitted the army was
[03:09:52.400 --> 03:09:56.240]  training for gun confiscation in Iowa and I've been to the drills a decade
[03:09:56.240 --> 03:09:59.880]  ago where they were training to take on American gun owners folks the military
[03:09:59.880 --> 03:10:07.360]  is training it was an NLEO 9 14 nations 14 nations to take on American gun
[03:10:07.360 --> 03:10:11.600]  owners I saw it with my own eyes and we have and like we have hours of video of
[03:10:11.600 --> 03:10:16.480]  this of the guys working together and doing these drills and I need you and

[03:13:38.560 --> 03:13:44.040]  onesie Williams now to recap what his major oil company executive Intel who
[03:13:44.040 --> 03:13:48.200]  we know the source this is real Intel it's been very accurate predictions in
[03:13:48.200 --> 03:13:52.280]  the past what he told him about the oil spill two weeks ago and the new
[03:13:52.280 --> 03:13:57.960]  developments since then Lindsay Williams go ahead sir the Gulf of Mexico oil
[03:13:57.960 --> 03:14:04.400]  disaster the real story of what happened out there what comes out of the Gulf of
[03:14:04.400 --> 03:14:10.600]  Mexico oil pressure with the oil this is causing the death of humans and
[03:14:10.600 --> 03:14:16.040]  unborn babies yes I'm concerned about the ecology I sure am but I am more
[03:14:16.040 --> 03:14:20.280]  concerned about what it's doing to human beings now let me do a very brief
[03:14:20.280 --> 03:14:26.080]  background in 1970 the Russians drilled the first what is known as super deep
[03:14:26.080 --> 03:14:33.920]  oil well they drilled it down to 40,230 feet it was called Cora SC3 since then
[03:14:33.920 --> 03:14:40.240]  because of what they found Russian oil majors Q Coast has drilled 310 successful
[03:14:40.240 --> 03:14:45.880]  deep wells and put them in production and last year Russia overtook Saudi
[03:14:45.880 --> 03:14:51.760]  Arabia as the world's biggest single oil producer and is now set to be the
[03:14:51.760 --> 03:14:56.680]  producer for the next century what did they find when they got 40,230 feet
[03:14:56.680 --> 03:15:03.120]  they did not find fossil fuel there are no rotted trees and plants and animals
[03:15:03.120 --> 03:15:10.840]  down that deep they found a biotic oil please write this down a BIO TIC oil
[03:15:10.840 --> 03:15:15.920]  this is oil that has been formed by chemical process somewhere in the heart
[03:15:15.920 --> 03:15:22.000]  of the earth and as a result of this Russia has become the oil producer there
[03:15:22.000 --> 03:15:28.720]  are now this oil is sweeping up into sour oil wells such as Saudi Arabia
[03:15:28.720 --> 03:15:36.760]  Nigeria Mexico many in America people are total misnomer now Russia had since
[03:15:36.760 --> 03:15:42.840]  enough and I I don't hesitate using these words Russia had since enough to
[03:15:42.840 --> 03:15:50.360]  drill their coal SC3 well down to 40,000 feet earn the land not in the Gulf of
[03:15:50.360 --> 03:15:56.920]  Mexico at this point I contacted the mr. X in my book the energy nine crisis and
[03:15:56.920 --> 03:16:02.960]  found out the real story what has happened the difference was BT has
[03:16:02.960 --> 03:16:09.840]  attempted to do in the Gulf of Mexico in the water ocean water what Russia did on
[03:16:09.840 --> 03:16:17.080]  the land BT was so stupid as to attempt to drill a super deep well first time
[03:16:17.080 --> 03:16:22.040]  it's ever been done besides anybody but Russia and they attempted to drill a
[03:16:22.040 --> 03:16:28.160]  super deep well of a floating platform that was not anchored to the bottom of
[03:16:28.160 --> 03:16:34.480]  the ocean and it was controlled its position by very sophisticated GPS
[03:16:34.480 --> 03:16:40.440]  equipment now the water at that point where they attempted to drill is 5,000
[03:16:40.440 --> 03:16:47.240]  feet deep that's approximately one mile 5,280 feet one mile they drill five
[03:16:47.240 --> 03:16:52.640]  thousand feet it was 5,000 feet to the bottom of the ocean and they drill from
[03:16:52.640 --> 03:16:59.520]  that point between 25 and 30,000 feet deep into the ocean now think of for a
[03:16:59.520 --> 03:17:05.240]  moment you're flying on that jet aircraft commercial airliner cross country you
[03:17:05.240 --> 03:17:09.760]  look out the window when the pilot says we have reached cruising altitude and
[03:17:09.760 --> 03:17:15.320]  what do you see you can hardly see the ground do you realize that's 30,000 feet
[03:17:15.320 --> 03:17:20.840]  and that's exactly where drill they had drilled they have drilled the
[03:17:20.840 --> 03:17:25.080]  approximately the depth of what you see from that jet aircraft is you traveling
[03:17:25.080 --> 03:17:29.600]  with a commercial airliner it's just preposterous now I've got to stop here
[03:17:29.600 --> 03:17:34.840]  long enough Alex to say the government of the United States of America issued
[03:17:34.840 --> 03:17:39.920]  the permits to BT to drill that well and I have not made this statement on any
[03:17:39.920 --> 03:17:44.120]  program before I don't think but I've come to this conclusion the government
[03:17:44.120 --> 03:17:48.600]  of the United States of America is just as much to blame for this Gulf of
[03:17:48.600 --> 03:17:53.800]  Mexico or disaster as BP they issued the permits they gave them the the
[03:17:53.800 --> 03:17:57.960]  permission to do it they knew where they were going they knew how deep they were
[03:17:57.960 --> 03:18:01.960]  going they knew that they could not possibly know what they were going to
[03:18:01.960 --> 03:18:08.440]  hit down there and when BP got down 25 to 30,000 feet let me be the size of the
[03:18:08.440 --> 03:18:13.480]  pipe you need to know these details as we go along this pipe that they were
[03:18:13.480 --> 03:18:20.000]  putting into the ocean for is 20 inches in diameter it is two inches thick of
[03:18:20.000 --> 03:18:25.120]  solid hardened steel in a moment I'll tell you what's happening to that pipe
[03:18:25.120 --> 03:18:31.120]  but right now let me go back to where we were those are the strata they get
[03:18:31.120 --> 03:18:37.160]  something so catastrophic so unexpected this is positively ears on accident
[03:18:37.160 --> 03:18:43.360]  folks don't for one minute's time say that that they did this intentionally they
[03:18:43.360 --> 03:18:49.200]  did not every one of my oil sources including the individual who might be
[03:18:49.200 --> 03:18:54.080]  able to contact with Halliburton every one of them said this happened by accident
[03:18:54.080 --> 03:18:58.400]  they did not know what they were hitting this is not a conspiracy this
[03:18:58.400 --> 03:19:02.000]  positively is something that they didn't know they won't get there yet a
[03:19:02.000 --> 03:19:06.080]  strata over now notice that word strata you're going to hear more of it even in
[03:19:06.080 --> 03:19:10.200]  the news as they come out with this those are the strata oil that was such
[03:19:10.200 --> 03:19:16.680]  high pressure that it burst every safety they had the pressure behind that oil is
[03:19:16.680 --> 03:19:21.480]  so high but it destroyed the maximum effort of human science to contain it
[03:19:21.480 --> 03:19:27.200]  and let's compare it for instance well Lindsay let's stop there we've got to go

[03:24:21.160 --> 03:24:25.680]  the number one issue and I agree this is all I hear my neighbors talking about
[03:24:25.680 --> 03:24:29.520]  people on other talk radio shows talking about and it's like what is the
[03:24:29.520 --> 03:24:31.800]  government gonna do what is the government gonna do and their their
[03:24:31.800 --> 03:24:40.320]  idea is carbon taxes gas taxes that will fully destroy our economy and still
[03:24:40.320 --> 03:24:45.960]  the oil well leaks and leaks and leaks and BP's been caught lying from the
[03:24:45.960 --> 03:24:54.960]  beginning now into day 67 and this is decimating the Gulf Coast but then I did
[03:24:54.960 --> 03:25:00.800]  read the reports that this oil is full of all sorts of other toxic elements and
[03:25:00.800 --> 03:25:04.600]  chemicals and heavy metals and it is killing dolphins and turtles and mass
[03:25:04.600 --> 03:25:09.840]  it is just destroying the fishing the agriculture the government said
[03:25:09.840 --> 03:25:14.320]  everything it can to block a good response Lindsay Williams continuing you
[03:25:14.320 --> 03:25:19.200]  got to the point of these super you know high-powered pressure of this well
[03:25:19.200 --> 03:25:25.880]  which they're now admitting and then you had new developments yes Alex when I
[03:25:25.880 --> 03:25:29.880]  was at food obey as the chaplain to the elite of the world for those three years
[03:25:29.880 --> 03:25:34.320]  time I watched them bring in many oil wells the very first thing they would
[03:25:34.320 --> 03:25:37.760]  give as soon as a new oil well was brought in they would do it and please
[03:25:37.760 --> 03:25:41.920]  write these words down you want to be correct whenever you say things Alex
[03:25:41.920 --> 03:25:45.920]  you'll notice that over the years the only thing I ever give on any show is
[03:25:45.920 --> 03:25:51.160]  what I can prove document and never do I go into I think so I hope so or
[03:25:51.160 --> 03:25:55.400]  possibly could be I'm still away from it the first thing they would give is the
[03:25:55.400 --> 03:26:01.080]  full rate they would check how much oil is coming out of that well how many
[03:26:01.080 --> 03:26:04.880]  barrels for a period of time second thing they would always give and you
[03:26:04.880 --> 03:26:10.640]  have never heard this about the Gulf of Mexico they always gave the pressure at
[03:26:10.640 --> 03:26:14.720]  the wall hit please write down the words well hit that's at the top of the pipe
[03:26:14.720 --> 03:26:19.080]  they would take the pressure that the pressure at food obey Alaska on the
[03:26:19.080 --> 03:26:26.840]  average well was 1500 pounds per square inch psi the automobile tire on your
[03:26:26.840 --> 03:26:32.000]  automobile has 35 pounds per square inch your truck tire on a big tandem tractor
[03:26:32.000 --> 03:26:37.200]  trailer rig 100 pounds are you ready please write this down from my sources
[03:26:37.200 --> 03:26:44.440]  they say that the Gulf of Mexico oil disaster BP's well hit a pressure
[03:26:44.440 --> 03:26:48.880]  that human beings have never experienced before on any world they've ever
[03:26:48.880 --> 03:26:55.160]  driven Russia never get this they get pressures but not this kind of pressure
[03:26:55.160 --> 03:27:05.280]  BP actually hit 20,000 to 70,000 pounds per square inch this just be you beyond
[03:27:05.280 --> 03:27:10.560]  human technology to contain it it blew everything it blew the safety valves it
[03:27:10.560 --> 03:27:15.600]  blew holes in the pipe oh please you've got this is a new one I'll inch first
[03:27:15.600 --> 03:27:19.800]  hit his first these as we go along you remember a moment ago I told you that
[03:27:19.800 --> 03:27:23.720]  that pipe that they drilled in the bottom of the ocean was two inches thick and
[03:27:23.720 --> 03:27:31.400]  20 inches in diameter solid hardened steel that pipe right now is no longer
[03:27:31.400 --> 03:27:38.160]  two inches thick it is one inch thick let me explain you remember that BP back
[03:27:38.160 --> 03:27:42.780]  about two three weeks ago closed down the trans-oil pipeline because for
[03:27:42.780 --> 03:27:47.520]  35 years they've been running oil through it and it has so diminished the
[03:27:47.520 --> 03:27:53.240]  thickness of the pipe that they were getting leaks everywhere this happens
[03:27:53.240 --> 03:27:58.440]  over a period of time because of the extreme pressure and the abrasive
[03:27:58.440 --> 03:28:03.880]  substances that are coming out of this pipe in the Gulf of Mexico the thickness
[03:28:03.880 --> 03:28:10.360]  of the wear of that pipe is no longer two inches it is all the way down to one
[03:28:10.360 --> 03:28:16.280]  inch now and by the time they can plant a nuclear device an angle drill and put
[03:28:16.280 --> 03:28:20.240]  it in three to four months from now they say as soon as they could possibly do
[03:28:20.240 --> 03:28:25.360]  anything about it they'll bring their pipe I mean this is so drastic folks I
[03:28:25.360 --> 03:28:31.000]  have sit here started meanwhile there's fishers a thousand pounds per inch there
[03:28:31.000 --> 03:28:34.840]  you know pipe there meanwhile there's fishers all over the ocean floor many
[03:28:34.840 --> 03:28:40.000]  miles away leaking so there's these fractures and for those that just joined
[03:28:40.000 --> 03:28:45.800]  as BP has now admitted this is up on prisonplanet.com they were aware of
[03:28:45.800 --> 03:28:51.440]  cracks in oil well two months before the explosion and that they were giving
[03:28:51.440 --> 03:28:55.960]  orders to people on the well that the engineers said were dangerous so just
[03:28:55.960 --> 03:29:00.960]  very reckless by BP now now now getting into the toxicity you say you were on a
[03:29:00.960 --> 03:29:06.120]  talk show in Florida and that people were calling in saying they were sick we
[03:29:06.120 --> 03:29:11.280]  know the workers in Mississippi Louisiana and Alabama are very sick BP's
[03:29:11.280 --> 03:29:14.680]  tried to make them sign waiver forms they're not even giving them the proper
[03:29:14.680 --> 03:29:19.160]  breathing apparatus they need because the type of toxic chemicals that are
[03:29:19.160 --> 03:29:27.000]  off-gassing out of this oil yes that is the most dangerous part you know most
[03:29:27.000 --> 03:29:31.880]  people think that the only thing that comes out of an oil well is oil no quite
[03:29:31.880 --> 03:29:36.240]  to the contrary there are many things that come out and it depends on the field
[03:29:36.240 --> 03:29:39.840]  or the strata that they go into as to what will actually come out of that
[03:29:39.840 --> 03:29:44.520]  well what is coming out of the well in the Gulf of Mexico now the oil has kind
[03:29:44.520 --> 03:29:49.520]  of a ready call stay there stay there Lindsay long segment coming up we'll
[03:29:49.520 --> 03:29:54.120]  get into what's coming out of the well we're on the March the Empire's on the

[03:31:34.480 --> 03:32:04.120]  Schachter and see what he has to say. Hi folks this is Alex Jones and I want to
[03:32:04.120 --> 03:32:07.920]  tell you about the silver lungs generator now you can produce pure and
[03:32:07.920 --> 03:32:11.880]  endless colloidal silver and deliver the solution directly into the bloodstream
[03:32:11.880 --> 03:32:16.360]  by breathing the solution through the lungs the respiratory system is the
[03:32:16.360 --> 03:32:20.400]  first line of defense for airborne pathogens and viruses the silver lungs
[03:32:20.400 --> 03:32:25.160]  generator infuses the respiratory system with your self-produced nano silver
[03:32:25.160 --> 03:32:30.240]  solutions and also delivers the silver nanoparticles instantly into the blood
[03:32:30.240 --> 03:32:34.320]  stream with continued legislation threatening the sale of nano silver
[03:32:34.320 --> 03:32:39.040]  products you can now produce pure and endless colloidal silver with the
[03:32:39.040 --> 03:32:43.320]  silver lungs generator very easy to follow step-by-step instructions are

[03:33:00.320 --> 03:33:11.640]  All right I'll be going into overdrive today for at least 20 minutes with
[03:33:11.640 --> 03:33:16.240]  Lindsey Williams we can get into all his new info I know in the last 20 minutes
[03:33:16.240 --> 03:33:20.720]  I've had him recap what he covered with us last week and now he's going to get
[03:33:20.720 --> 03:33:25.720]  into the new developments from his sources and then also give you my
[03:33:25.720 --> 03:33:29.040]  perspective and we're going to be taking your phone calls here in just a few
[03:33:29.040 --> 03:33:33.840]  minutes Mark Andrew Allen Grant James and others the toll train number to join
[03:33:33.840 --> 03:33:41.360]  us on air dealing with the oil spill in the aftermath 1-800-259-9231 but I
[03:33:41.360 --> 03:33:46.440]  have seen EPA scientists saying in some areas of the Gulf there is toxic gases
[03:33:46.440 --> 03:33:51.000]  you should move out of the area we know they have moved National Guard in there's
[03:33:51.000 --> 03:33:55.800]  been rumors of evacuation but Lindsey Williams you said you've been talking
[03:33:55.800 --> 03:34:00.760]  to Gulf radio shows you've been on and I've been on a few myself in Florida in
[03:34:00.760 --> 03:34:05.280]  Mississippi in Louisiana in Alabama and none of the people are saying they're
[03:34:05.280 --> 03:34:09.560]  being told to evacuate but we saw what happened with Katrina where they locked
[03:34:09.560 --> 03:34:14.520]  down the city wouldn't let people get out and then came for the guns and so the
[03:34:14.520 --> 03:34:20.720]  government is capable of anything and my concern is if a hurricane does hit
[03:34:20.720 --> 03:34:25.160]  we're only about two months out from that unfortunately not only will you have
[03:34:25.160 --> 03:34:30.000]  the currents taking it out of the Gulf around Florida into the Atlantic and
[03:34:30.000 --> 03:34:34.280]  dispersing it into a wider area which is still a problem but at least it's a
[03:34:34.280 --> 03:34:38.800]  larger mass area that will be in more diluted more time to break down
[03:34:38.800 --> 03:34:45.320]  through regular you know bio degrade that oil is very susceptible to but that
[03:34:45.320 --> 03:34:51.200]  the hurricanes are gonna drive all that oil most of it out in the ocean up on
[03:34:51.200 --> 03:34:57.120]  the beaches with the chemicals that it's off gassing and so that could trigger
[03:34:57.120 --> 03:35:03.520]  just a disaster of unprecedented proportions here in North America they
[03:35:03.520 --> 03:35:07.720]  have had similar things happen in the Gulf and in different regions around the
[03:35:07.720 --> 03:35:13.000]  Middle East it's happening in Indonesia so they have had other big oil spills
[03:35:13.000 --> 03:35:18.280]  but this one is starting to rival those so continue with the toxicity issue and
[03:35:18.280 --> 03:35:24.280]  then any intel you've got on moves for forced evacuations because you know I
[03:35:24.280 --> 03:35:27.560]  saw these reports two weeks ago and I called the towns it was supposedly
[03:35:27.560 --> 03:35:31.720]  happening and I called hotels I called 7-elevens people said no there's no
[03:35:31.720 --> 03:35:35.440]  troops here now some areas that there's troops here but there's no evacuation so
[03:35:35.440 --> 03:35:39.920]  Lindsay continue and we're gonna go to phone calls well Alex you mentioned a
[03:35:39.920 --> 03:35:43.800]  subject a moment ago I need to briefly touch on so they'll understand the max
[03:35:43.800 --> 03:35:49.720]  the magnitude of this whole thing senator Bill Nelson appeared on he's a
[03:35:49.720 --> 03:35:56.200]  Democrat from Florida he appeared on MSNBC with Andrew Mitchell on the night
[03:35:56.200 --> 03:36:01.600]  the gym and he said oil is seeping up from the seabed just after that the
[03:36:01.600 --> 03:36:06.120]  National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration who has been denying
[03:36:06.120 --> 03:36:12.280]  that the NDP both for all of this time has been denying that there are any leaks
[03:36:12.280 --> 03:36:17.520]  coming out at other places in the ocean that means plumes of oil coming up
[03:36:17.520 --> 03:36:22.080]  that somehow escaped from that pipe because unladaily that big pipe was
[03:36:22.080 --> 03:36:26.000]  perforated at the time this humongous amount of pressure hit it twenty to
[03:36:26.000 --> 03:36:30.800]  seventy thousand pounds per square inch they just admitted to it this is by
[03:36:30.800 --> 03:36:35.040]  Chris Bartelmore from Houston Texas it was on Wilder's News on June the 8th and
[03:36:35.040 --> 03:36:40.640]  they said experts are investigating and report admitting all our plumes
[03:36:40.640 --> 03:36:45.200]  estimating for the BP's fixed-trick and oil well the Gulf of Mexico and they
[03:36:45.200 --> 03:36:51.120]  say that these plumes are appearing as much as 20 miles away did you catch that
[03:36:51.120 --> 03:36:58.480]  folks do you realize that 20 that 25 to 30 thousand feet down that big two inch
[03:36:58.480 --> 03:37:04.960]  thick hardened pipe steel pipe has undoubtedly burst and these plumes are
[03:37:04.960 --> 03:37:09.880]  working their way out but through the bottom of the ocean and they now are
[03:37:09.880 --> 03:37:13.920]  for the first time admitting that they're there even if they stop the pipe
[03:37:13.920 --> 03:37:17.920]  itself from pulling how many plumes do they have out there that they want to
[03:37:17.920 --> 03:37:22.920]  stop too now Matt Simmons is a very well-respected person in the oil
[03:37:22.920 --> 03:37:27.560]  industry and they may have hit a level where it's abiotic where it's basically
[03:37:27.560 --> 03:37:32.240]  unlimited we know many of the old oil wells are now filling back up and more
[03:37:32.240 --> 03:37:35.680]  and more petroleum geologists and scientists do believe that it is
[03:37:35.680 --> 03:37:41.600]  abiotic being made in the earth you can find some small deposits of the you know
[03:37:41.600 --> 03:37:47.400]  oil as we know it that has particulate from animals in it you know dead
[03:37:47.400 --> 03:37:53.440]  prehistoric creatures fossils you know coal that has the imprint of ferns in it
[03:37:53.440 --> 03:37:58.800]  so we know there is some fossil fuel that is based on dead life and swamps
[03:37:58.800 --> 03:38:03.960]  but more and more the evidence shows that most oil is abiotic being produced
[03:38:03.960 --> 03:38:08.760]  down in the earth and what if they've hit a new strata and this sucker just
[03:38:08.760 --> 03:38:16.680]  keeps pumping for years then we could have a problem which which is biblical
[03:38:16.680 --> 03:38:24.640]  and proportions Alex Matt Simmons said just this week twenty five thousand
[03:38:24.640 --> 03:38:30.000]  barrels of oil are being released per day now he's the first one to come out
[03:38:30.000 --> 03:38:34.040]  with a figure that's big you remember my sources said there were so many gallons
[03:38:34.040 --> 03:38:38.320]  per day Matt Simmons says it's twenty five thousand bags but now the reason I
[03:38:38.320 --> 03:38:41.600]  gave that figure first before I gave the ones about what's coming out with the
[03:38:41.600 --> 03:38:47.720]  oil is because you've got to understand the magnitude of the immense city of
[03:38:47.720 --> 03:38:51.440]  what's coming out of that where to the point that it comes all the way to the
[03:38:51.440 --> 03:38:56.920]  surface in a geyser type thing from all the way down five miles five thousand
[03:38:56.920 --> 03:39:03.760]  feet now coming up with that oil the the Environmental Protection Agency just
[03:39:03.760 --> 03:39:08.200]  gave these statistics the other day I'm going to read them to you my goodness
[03:39:08.200 --> 03:39:14.800]  they are so struggling coming up with the oil on these gases they are toxic they
[03:39:14.800 --> 03:39:21.480]  are flammable if we have a hurricane Lord have mercy I cannot imagine the
[03:39:21.480 --> 03:39:24.880]  respiratory problems and the health problems that are going to develop
[03:39:24.880 --> 03:39:29.200]  all the way up the east coast of America as these gases are taken there
[03:39:29.200 --> 03:39:33.080]  people are already sick in Florida as I mentioned from the radio show I was on
[03:39:33.080 --> 03:39:37.680]  yesterday in all and the Florida where the talk show host himself said I've been
[03:39:37.680 --> 03:39:43.920]  wanting to throw up for three days now here they are the EPA said that hydrogen
[03:39:43.920 --> 03:39:49.640]  sulfide is coming out of that well now I'm going to give you what they allow as
[03:39:49.640 --> 03:39:55.920]  the allowable limits for a person to breathe and be safe five to ten parts
[03:39:55.920 --> 03:40:03.360]  per billion please write these letters down T T B as in burry the current
[03:40:03.360 --> 03:40:10.560]  tested levels of hydrogen sulfide are one thousand two hundred parts per billion
[03:40:10.560 --> 03:40:16.000]  this is staggering and they aren't telling people about this the mothers
[03:40:16.000 --> 03:40:20.600]  who are carrying babies I'm born you know what this is going to do to them can
[03:40:20.600 --> 03:40:24.360]  you have the slightest idea the health defects that are going to develop from
[03:40:24.360 --> 03:40:29.840]  this the next one is benzene and this one really frightens me benzene is toxic
[03:40:29.840 --> 03:40:36.400]  benzene is a carcinogen benzene causes cancer the safe level benzene is so
[03:40:36.400 --> 03:40:41.920]  dangerous that the environmental protection agency only allows zero to
[03:40:41.920 --> 03:40:47.960]  fill parts per billion to be contacted by a human being otherwise they say it's
[03:40:47.960 --> 03:40:53.600]  dangerous they are presently testing the environmental protection agency just the
[03:40:53.600 --> 03:41:00.640]  other day went to the Gulf tested it three thousand parts per billion in the
[03:41:00.640 --> 03:41:06.320]  atmosphere now even if the atmosphere weakens the content of that by the time
[03:41:06.320 --> 03:41:12.040]  it reaches the land it's still far above anything that the environmental
[03:41:12.040 --> 03:41:15.920]  protection agency would ever allow me let me give you what the EPA let me give
[03:41:15.920 --> 03:41:19.720]  with the EPA says and what they and what the Associated Press is saying take
[03:41:19.720 --> 03:41:24.040]  precautions to move out of the area if impacted by oil spills says
[03:41:24.040 --> 03:41:29.640]  environmental chemists toxins are at 200 times normal levels along the coast now
[03:41:29.640 --> 03:41:33.560]  now Lindsay I want to get into the new info before we go to these calls because
[03:41:33.560 --> 03:41:38.920]  we got a bunch of calls we've got to get to give us any of the new intel or
[03:41:38.920 --> 03:41:42.720]  anything else your source told you or anything else you want to discuss well
[03:41:42.720 --> 03:41:46.800]  first of all this radio show that I was just on yesterday unbelievable the pipe
[03:41:46.800 --> 03:41:51.920]  in the Gulf of Mexico I think is very significant in that it has eroded already
[03:41:51.920 --> 03:41:57.720]  one inch of its thickness because of the abrasives coming out and there will be
[03:41:57.720 --> 03:42:02.720]  no pipe there as often three to four months from now whatever they say they
[03:42:02.720 --> 03:42:07.080]  could plant a nuclear device and with all of these other gestures that are
[03:42:07.080 --> 03:42:13.520]  coming out at distances up to 20 miles Alex I think we have got a a
[03:42:13.520 --> 03:42:19.760]  preposterous epic propulsion a disaster here such as the United States of
[03:42:19.760 --> 03:42:24.960]  America maybe the whole world has never experienced before and I'm sure Obama
[03:42:24.960 --> 03:42:34.160]  will give us a carbon tax that we pay Al Gore that will fix it what do you think
[03:42:34.160 --> 03:42:38.960]  of Obama pushing a carbon tax is the supposed solution well I have been
[03:42:38.960 --> 03:42:45.400]  told by some very other sources you know I have some of them that the gut that the
[03:42:45.400 --> 03:42:51.040]  elite positively will use this disaster even though it's an accident they will
[03:42:51.040 --> 03:42:57.880]  use it to accomplish their 2010 timeline people please please I beg of you get my
[03:42:57.880 --> 03:43:02.040]  documentary we just prepared it a few days ago would you please call this
[03:43:02.040 --> 03:43:13.480]  number the number is 888-799-6111 or go on the web to prophecyclub.com
[03:43:13.480 --> 03:43:20.160]  p-r-o-p-h-e-c-y c-l-u-b.com are a total free number where the
[03:43:20.160 --> 03:43:29.320]  operator standing by right now 888-799-6111 the entire story of what the
[03:43:29.320 --> 03:43:33.880]  elite plan to do with this a documentary I just prepared with everything I'm
[03:43:33.880 --> 03:43:38.920]  giving here even the other night on coast to coast I have two hours I only
[03:43:38.920 --> 03:43:43.200]  covered maybe half of my materials and I understand there's a there's a lot of
[03:43:43.200 --> 03:43:48.640]  there's a lot of info and and we're gonna give people that phone number and
[03:43:48.640 --> 03:43:52.800]  website again one more time but specifically though from all of your
[03:43:52.800 --> 03:43:57.040]  sources and the radio interviews you're doing you because you told me during a
[03:43:57.040 --> 03:44:02.520]  break Lindsay the good news is you have not seen any proof that the military is
[03:44:02.520 --> 03:44:07.000]  preparing for a forced evacuation of tens of millions of people on the Gulf
[03:44:07.000 --> 03:44:12.040]  Coast I've talked with a number of people in Florida and the Gulf Coast and I've
[03:44:12.040 --> 03:44:15.800]  asked everyone out in the same question do you see any evidence of a forced
[03:44:15.800 --> 03:44:20.120]  evacuation the talk show host on yesterday along with the cars and there
[03:44:20.120 --> 03:44:25.280]  were an entire hour of four lines every single one of them said we have seen
[03:44:25.280 --> 03:44:30.240]  no evidence whatsoever so far or even heard any evidence of a forced
[03:44:30.240 --> 03:44:34.800]  evacuation okay okay listen we're gonna go 20 minutes of overdrive that'll be at
[03:44:34.800 --> 03:44:39.280]  info wars.com on the audio streams and for prison planet TV viewers it won't be
[03:44:39.280 --> 03:44:43.000]  on the AM and FM we've only got about 15 minutes left right before the show
[03:44:43.000 --> 03:44:46.960]  officially ends in 15 minutes we'll give out that number website one more time
[03:44:46.960 --> 03:44:50.760]  but speaking of callers let's get to them mark in Texas thanks for holding
[03:44:50.760 --> 03:44:56.400]  you're on the air with Lindsay Williams go ahead hey thank you a couple questions
[03:44:56.400 --> 03:45:01.520]  and then I wanted to see if the people or Lindsay had heard you speak of Alex
[03:45:01.520 --> 03:45:06.160]  with your son talking about himself reading the Bible how that might be a
[03:45:06.160 --> 03:45:09.800]  help to other people get a hold of some things and how they deal with stuff and
[03:45:09.800 --> 03:45:14.320]  that Hebrews 9 seem to be a key to understand the rest of the Bible I
[03:45:14.320 --> 03:45:19.120]  read recently like a family member who dies and he being crucified I don't
[03:45:19.120 --> 03:45:23.320]  think he'd leave without leaving us some detailed instructions now I know you
[03:45:23.320 --> 03:45:26.480]  mark and I appreciate your call but we just got questions for Lindsay Williams
[03:45:26.480 --> 03:45:32.360]  here Andrew in Ohio Andrew you're on the air go ahead hi Alex thank you for
[03:45:32.360 --> 03:45:39.400]  taking my call I've been researching this for several weeks now and the black
[03:45:39.400 --> 03:45:45.720]  stone group owns the company that makes core exit which is far far more toxic
[03:45:45.720 --> 03:45:51.880]  it's a dispersion that they are putting like a million gallons or so mixing it
[03:45:51.880 --> 03:45:57.640]  with the oil and they may say that these toxic chemicals are coming out of the
[03:45:57.640 --> 03:46:03.200]  well but they're the ones that are adding it to the golf and the crap you
[03:46:03.200 --> 03:46:07.440]  know that's a good point normally we don't see people getting this sick from
[03:46:07.440 --> 03:46:13.120]  an oil spill it was different variants of crude oil so it varies from type to type
[03:46:13.120 --> 03:46:17.680]  strata to strata region to region but they are pumping all these admittedly
[03:46:17.680 --> 03:46:23.200]  deadly poison dispersants in so it's a case of the curbing worse than disease
[03:46:23.200 --> 03:46:28.920]  go ahead yes let me answer his question about core exit last week on your
[03:46:28.920 --> 03:46:33.240]  program I had so much material I never even got to this subject I'm so glad to
[03:46:33.240 --> 03:46:38.720]  call call in about it scientists believe that BP is dumping millions of gallons of
[03:46:38.720 --> 03:46:43.480]  core exit nine thousand five hundred a chemical dispersion patient under the
[03:46:43.480 --> 03:46:49.560]  Gulf of Mexico workers to hide the full extent of the leak now estimated to be
[03:46:49.560 --> 03:46:54.380]  two point nine gallons a day well as you know what Matt Simmons said 20th much
[03:46:54.380 --> 03:46:59.400]  more than that all right core exit nine thousand five hundred years or so but
[03:46:59.400 --> 03:47:09.320]  birds three times more toxic than oil the agent scientists believe has a two point six one PPM toxicity level and
[03:47:09.320 --> 03:47:14.280]  when mixed with the war murders of the Gulf of Mexico its molecules will be able
[03:47:14.280 --> 03:47:19.960]  to those transition the transition involves the change of a liquid into a
[03:47:19.960 --> 03:47:25.320]  gaseous state which can be absorbed by clouds the gas will then be released as
[03:47:25.320 --> 03:47:31.040]  toxic rain leading to unimaginable environmental catastrophe destroying
[03:47:31.040 --> 03:47:35.880]  our life terms in the bottom of the evolution shark in the Gulf of Mexico
[03:47:35.880 --> 03:47:40.400]  that this is drastic but I haven't even had time to give it because it and then
[03:47:40.400 --> 03:47:45.880]  that'll cause red tides and that's why they're reporting these big giant toxic
[03:47:45.880 --> 03:47:51.000]  plumes under the surface as well not just coming out of the other fissures so
[03:47:51.000 --> 03:47:54.360]  we'll continue to analyze this but just remember they're gearing up for war with
[03:47:54.360 --> 03:47:58.280]  Iran while we're talking about this and the bankers are setting up their world
[03:47:58.280 --> 03:48:02.720]  government right now boy this is very convenient timing for the hours keep in
[03:48:02.720 --> 03:48:07.760]  mind that my format now three eighty seven year old gentlemen told me a year
[03:48:07.760 --> 03:48:12.320]  and a half ago that that they did not want war with Iran for two years that
[03:48:12.320 --> 03:48:16.920]  was a year and a half ago Alex we've only got six months and they have planned
[03:48:16.920 --> 03:48:22.680]  you are going to see this escalate now and they will use this Gulf of Mexico
[03:48:22.680 --> 03:48:27.400]  disaster to fit into all of the other other plans in order to fulfill that
[03:48:27.400 --> 03:48:33.680]  20 to 12 timeline all right well that's what it looks like what it's shaping up
[03:48:33.680 --> 03:48:42.040]  for anything else Andrew sir it is possible to plug the oil well by putting
[03:48:42.040 --> 03:48:49.760]  a plate of pig down the shaft and using thermite to weld the plug at the deep
[03:48:49.760 --> 03:48:54.000]  farthest end yeah but how do you put a pig and for those that don't know that's
[03:48:54.000 --> 03:48:59.680]  one of these little robot systems how do you have it go into a crushed well head
[03:48:59.680 --> 03:49:05.040]  and when it's got all that pressure you know coming out of it yes they could
[03:49:05.040 --> 03:49:10.520]  run a robot up in it and then have it seal it but how do you do that when you
[03:49:10.520 --> 03:49:15.200]  got all this oil and chemicals gushing around it Lindsey Williams well the
[03:49:15.200 --> 03:49:19.800]  pipe is already perforated they know because of these plumes that are coming up as much
[03:49:19.800 --> 03:49:24.560]  as 20 miles away which the you know AA now is admitting to and they wouldn't
[03:49:24.560 --> 03:49:28.320]  admit to with oil there's no way you can stop this because all you do is just
[03:49:28.320 --> 03:49:31.720]  open up for that pipe even further down the line somewhere you still get the
[03:49:31.720 --> 03:49:35.880]  plumes out there's a distance all right I appreciate your call anything else
[03:49:35.880 --> 03:49:42.280]  Andrew all right I want to hear more about that system by the way this is up
[03:49:42.280 --> 03:49:49.000]  on prisonplanet.com right now and of course that deals with the fact that
[03:49:49.000 --> 03:49:53.920]  the head of BP actually had the article here in front of me let me pull it back
[03:49:53.920 --> 03:50:00.520]  up because I can't can't find it now oh here it is BP aware of cracks in oil well
[03:50:00.520 --> 03:50:08.480]  two months before explosion former VP chairman and current VP CEO both dump
[03:50:08.480 --> 03:50:13.200]  stocks in weeks before disaster BP was aware of cracks appearing in the well as
[03:50:13.200 --> 03:50:16.640]  far back as February right around the time Goldman Sachs and BP chairman Tony
[03:50:16.640 --> 03:50:20.560]  Hayward were busy dumping their stock in the company on the eve of the explosion
[03:50:20.560 --> 03:50:23.360]  the lead of the oil spill according to information and covered by congressional
[03:50:23.360 --> 03:50:27.840]  investigators the mining and mineral service agency released documents to
[03:50:27.840 --> 03:50:33.520]  Bloomberg indicating that BP was trying to seal cracks in the well almost 40 miles
[03:50:33.520 --> 03:50:38.520]  64 kilometers off of Louisiana coast this is big news up on prisonplanet.com this
[03:50:38.520 --> 03:50:42.760]  is confirmed Bloomberg the fissures which BP began to attempt to fix in
[03:50:42.760 --> 03:50:48.040]  February 13th could have played a role in the disaster though this is a
[03:50:48.040 --> 03:50:51.200]  question still being explored by investigators but that would show where
[03:50:51.200 --> 03:50:55.000]  the plumes are coming from and it just continues very important piece of

[03:55:14.200 --> 03:55:21.600]  emergency CD audio CD with all the information that his source inside the
[03:55:21.600 --> 03:55:26.360]  oil companies gave him but so much of what Lindsay's talked about has now been
[03:55:26.360 --> 03:55:31.240]  borne out in mainstream news and it clearly the oil companies you know BP
[03:55:31.240 --> 03:55:36.920]  and Halliburton involved are involved in a cover up this is very very serious
[03:55:36.920 --> 03:55:41.600]  and Obama's using it to try to pass carbon taxes on the American people which
[03:55:41.600 --> 03:55:47.000]  BP's been the biggest supporter of so I want to encourage everybody to call and

[03:56:39.400 --> 03:56:41.960]  time we're almost out of time here right at the end I want to jam in some more
[03:56:41.960 --> 03:56:48.320]  calls let's talk to Grant and PA you're on the air go ahead Grant hi Alex I
[03:56:48.320 --> 03:56:52.760]  would like to I have a question for Lindsay Williams and I'd like to say
[03:56:52.760 --> 03:56:58.000]  that I choose not to believe that 9-11 was not an inside job just because our
[03:56:58.000 --> 03:57:01.280]  government says so because it scientifically doesn't seem to make
[03:57:01.280 --> 03:57:04.960]  sense that the buildings could have fallen that fast just by being hit by the
[03:57:04.960 --> 03:57:09.400]  planes alone I also choose not to believe that anyone has ever walked on
[03:57:09.400 --> 03:57:13.320]  water or come back to life after being dead for three days because
[03:57:13.320 --> 03:57:16.960]  scientifically that's absolutely ridiculous I'd also like to add to that
[03:57:16.960 --> 03:57:24.160]  but I used to be a Christian myself and I would recommend everyone listen to
[03:57:24.160 --> 03:57:28.600]  this I'm gonna put you on hold here and we look I mean I only do this maybe once
[03:57:28.600 --> 03:57:33.560]  or twice a week we have a guest on and I say I want to be on topic if you have
[03:57:33.560 --> 03:57:40.960]  questions for the guest and then people deliberately deliberately talk about
[03:57:40.960 --> 03:57:45.760]  anything but that and I don't understand it so I'm gonna from now on I'll let
[03:57:45.760 --> 03:57:51.080]  people go when we're on a topic we're having a discussion on a topic it's
[03:57:51.080 --> 03:57:55.520]  insanity and you can get mad at me if you want I mean if you called in Grant on
[03:57:55.520 --> 03:57:59.800]  a regular day when it's just open phones and wanted to say that that's fine we
[03:57:59.800 --> 03:58:06.160]  don't screen your calls but I mean it's ridiculous that other callers are left
[03:58:06.160 --> 03:58:12.160]  on hold so you can talk about that James Hunter and others if you want to
[03:58:12.160 --> 03:58:15.120]  talk to Lindsay Williams and ask him a question or make a comment about the
[03:58:15.120 --> 03:58:19.160]  oil spill or you're in Louisiana Mississippi Florida you've got comments
[03:58:19.160 --> 03:58:25.440]  if you're having respiratory problems we want to hear from you 888-201-2244

[03:58:59.520 --> 03:59:04.040]  number two our new energies are wants to control how much power your electric
[03:59:04.040 --> 03:59:07.600]  company allows you to have it's true total government control of
[03:59:07.600 --> 03:59:12.000]  electricity in the name of smart grid technology is coming number three in
[03:59:12.000 --> 03:59:16.320]  some areas of the country the power grid is dangerously overloaded and now new
[03:59:16.320 --> 03:59:20.080]  socialist legislation is only compounding the problem number four
[03:59:20.080 --> 03:59:24.160]  dangerous weather is always a threat to local grids every year thousands of
[03:59:24.160 --> 03:59:27.880]  families lose their power from weather related onages number five a solar
[03:59:27.880 --> 03:59:31.960]  power generator provides powerful backup insurance and peace of mind folks I
[03:59:31.960 --> 03:59:34.680]  really believe in the solar power generators offered by solutions from

[04:02:07.720 --> 04:02:11.760]  support I can't believe how far we've come but our audience doubles every year

[04:02:44.200 --> 04:02:49.120]  best we can. Lindsey before we go to Brian, Jerry, Dave, Dick and others please
[04:02:49.120 --> 04:02:57.240]  you know any other information that you forgot to cover or what your source
[04:02:57.240 --> 04:03:01.720]  told you about the oil spill or where you see this going anything else you
[04:03:01.720 --> 04:03:06.160]  haven't gotten to before we go to calls? Where I see it going I think this is very
[04:03:06.160 --> 04:03:11.920]  important. They say that there's no possibility of them doing anything
[04:03:11.920 --> 04:03:17.960]  about this or at least bullmunch. Can you comprehend a doubling what's already
[04:03:17.960 --> 04:03:21.680]  been done in the web disaster taking place within the next four months time?
[04:03:21.680 --> 04:03:27.520]  They say in order to angle drill down to attempt to put a nuclear device if they
[04:03:27.520 --> 04:03:32.000]  even are willing to do it because and they say in order to do that there's
[04:03:32.000 --> 04:03:36.280]  four months involved in doing it and they haven't even started yet so this
[04:03:36.280 --> 04:03:39.840]  means that you're going to have a continued process of what's taking
[04:03:39.840 --> 04:03:44.960]  place right now for at least that period of time and then as my sources
[04:03:44.960 --> 04:03:49.600]  originally told me I could actually hear the fear in their voices when they
[04:03:49.600 --> 04:03:54.440]  said the only alternative is a nuclear device and they said but we don't
[04:03:54.440 --> 04:04:00.040]  like that idea I said why they said because if we fracture this strata
[04:04:00.040 --> 04:04:04.960]  that is has such tremendous pressure then he said there will never be any
[04:04:04.960 --> 04:04:09.320]  stopping of it and he said we don't even want to think about that we'll need to do
[04:04:09.320 --> 04:04:15.280]  I to never stop this world from coming out into the Gulf of Mexico I mean this
[04:04:15.280 --> 04:04:19.280]  is unthinkable it would be a disaster such as the world could never even
[04:04:19.280 --> 04:04:24.200]  imagine all right second like there is no need for any of this none of this
[04:04:24.200 --> 04:04:29.720]  should have ever happened we have on our own soil in North and South Dakota and
[04:04:29.720 --> 04:04:34.520]  Montana the back and oil reserve it has already been put in the congressional
[04:04:34.520 --> 04:04:39.120]  record the congressman know it's there and the only thing that is keeping this
[04:04:39.120 --> 04:04:44.800]  oil on the land not in the Gulf of Mexico and the waters from being produced
[04:04:44.800 --> 04:04:50.280]  Congress will have the crazy I mean it's unbelievable is eight times as much as
[04:04:50.280 --> 04:04:56.240]  much oil as Saudi Arabia 18 times as much oil as Iraq 21 times as much oil as
[04:04:56.240 --> 04:05:03.560]  Q8 22 times as much oil is Iran 500 times as much oil as Yemen we have it on
[04:05:03.560 --> 04:05:09.080]  our own soil on the land they could begin drilling any day they want to it is
[04:05:09.080 --> 04:05:14.880]  not a super deep well and they know that we have a supply and we didn't have to
[04:05:14.880 --> 04:05:21.760]  do this in the Gulf of Mexico Alex well those are really pertinent points that
[04:05:21.760 --> 04:05:29.080]  you make Lindsay and it's the type of thing that the media loves because it
[04:05:29.080 --> 04:05:34.280]  it just goes on every day with new facets and new information becomes a soap
[04:05:34.280 --> 04:05:39.160]  opera but it's a real-world soap opera destroying sea turtles and dolphins and
[04:05:39.160 --> 04:05:43.760]  fisheries and fishermen's lives and the people involved in the cleanups are
[04:05:43.760 --> 04:05:50.440]  getting sick from the dispersants and the oil and you got volcanoes going off in
[04:05:50.440 --> 04:05:54.480]  Iceland shutting down air traffic and you've got depression and countries
[04:05:54.480 --> 04:06:00.160]  falling and this quickening accelerating very very bizarre to see this
[04:06:00.160 --> 04:06:03.600]  unfolding let's hurry now through your calls I want to thank everybody for
[04:06:03.600 --> 04:06:08.840]  calling in and for holding Brian in Ohio welcome you're on the air I was going
[04:06:08.840 --> 04:06:14.720]  Alex good sir go ahead I was mentioned a few months ago that the elite teller
[04:06:14.720 --> 04:06:21.240]  story through movies and supposedly in the movie the knowing that there was a
[04:06:21.240 --> 04:06:27.360]  mention of the oil spill or an explosion April 20th well there's any
[04:06:27.360 --> 04:06:32.120]  correlation with that well there's a lot of movies and a lot of TV shows where
[04:06:32.120 --> 04:06:35.320]  the globalists do predictive programming where they throw in your face
[04:06:35.320 --> 04:06:40.440]  what they're planning to do later as kind of an inside joke to themselves as a
[04:06:40.440 --> 04:06:46.440]  calling card but also to subconsciously prepare you for it to happen and there's
[04:06:46.440 --> 04:06:53.000]  hundreds of examples with the best example is the fact that six months
[04:06:53.000 --> 04:06:59.680]  before 9-11 the lone gunman a spinoff of the X-files the CIA contacted Chris
[04:06:59.680 --> 04:07:04.280]  Carter and others and I was told this by Dean Hagel and star of the show he was
[04:07:04.280 --> 04:07:07.400]  so concerned about this he traveled to Austin to speak with me so the CIA
[04:07:07.400 --> 04:07:15.600]  planted those those those storylines on them and he went on to say that well I
[04:07:15.600 --> 04:07:19.880]  mean you watch the show the government hijacks a jet to fly it in the World
[04:07:19.880 --> 04:07:26.800]  Trade Center to blame it on I Afghanistan and the government uses a drill a
[04:07:26.800 --> 04:07:31.440]  terror drill to make the rest of the government stand down and that's
[04:07:31.440 --> 04:07:36.040]  actually what happened on 9-11 and so there is something to that I appreciate
[04:07:36.040 --> 04:07:41.360]  your call anything else Brian appreciate it thank you thank you any comments on
[04:07:41.360 --> 04:07:46.440]  that Lindsay because you say your source who's a former oil company executive
[04:07:46.440 --> 04:07:51.400]  told you it was an accident you know a globalist a lot of times will tell
[04:07:51.400 --> 04:07:57.720]  people the truth for a long time we lose Lindsay or we lose Brian okay Lindsay
[04:07:57.720 --> 04:08:05.080]  you there we have Lindsay I didn't hear the last of that because of a dial
[04:08:05.080 --> 04:08:09.920]  tone yeah I think we have a phone system hiccup there but we'll work on that I'm
[04:08:09.920 --> 04:08:13.640]  not saying this is what happened but but I mean I know who your oil executive
[04:08:13.640 --> 04:08:16.920]  contact is you've gotten good intel in the past it's turned out to be very
[04:08:16.920 --> 04:08:21.920]  accurate you know you said a year before when oil was $60 a barrel and it was
[04:08:21.920 --> 04:08:26.720]  gonna be 150 and that happened and of course Bilderberg group was saying
[04:08:26.720 --> 04:08:31.040]  similar things and so these these elites go in circles you know the same
[04:08:31.040 --> 04:08:36.120]  circles but a lot of times these globalists will give people good info
[04:08:36.120 --> 04:08:42.360]  to then later at a key time give them true info but mix some lies in to put
[04:08:42.360 --> 04:08:46.720]  out this info I mean how does your oil company executive friend know that this
[04:08:46.720 --> 04:08:55.480]  wasn't staged 87 year old man has cancer facing the grave he has never told me
[04:08:55.480 --> 04:08:59.960]  anything that was wrong over the past 35 years I have no choice to believe what
[04:08:59.960 --> 04:09:06.240]  he's saying right now Atlantic Ridgefield former retired now saying the same
[04:09:06.240 --> 04:09:11.840]  thing there's one thing I learned Alex when I live with the elite and that is
[04:09:11.840 --> 04:09:15.720]  they do have a moral code it's quite different than the moral code that you
[04:09:15.720 --> 04:09:20.080]  and I have and one of the facets of their moral code is that they must tell
[04:09:20.080 --> 04:09:25.880]  the world everything they're going to do before they do it Katrina yeah they
[04:09:25.880 --> 04:09:29.960]  have a storm just a few weeks before it and told you everything they were going
[04:09:29.960 --> 04:09:34.800]  to do the thing is the average person does not know how to interpret what
[04:09:34.800 --> 04:09:39.440]  these people are saying but they do tell you ahead of time what they're going to
[04:09:39.440 --> 04:09:44.720]  do what happened in the Gulf there was no ahead of time on this because this
[04:09:44.720 --> 04:09:49.760]  happened by accident but they are going to use this now to accomplish their
[04:09:49.760 --> 04:09:59.720]  2012 timeline all right let's go back to your phone calls here let's talk with
[04:09:59.720 --> 04:10:06.200]  Jerry and Indiana you're on the air Jerry oh Alex present planet member for
[04:10:06.200 --> 04:10:10.320]  many years involved to your videos this week thank you couldn't do it without you
[04:10:10.320 --> 04:10:17.280]  and we need you more than ever Alex Jones right now I'm buying the videos
[04:10:17.280 --> 04:10:22.720]  getting them copied Lindsay Williams I bought two years I can't thank you enough
[04:10:22.720 --> 04:10:30.040]  for what you're doing exposing this fraud and these elitists my question is
[04:10:30.040 --> 04:10:34.480]  for Lindsay Lindsay the worst-case scenario I know this is going to be hard
[04:10:34.480 --> 04:10:42.160]  to answer but if this you know this oil in the Gulf if it meets up with a major
[04:10:42.160 --> 04:10:50.880]  hurricane and Alex chime in here too how far north will this oil go I mean is
[04:10:50.880 --> 04:10:57.920]  there any well I'm not a hydrologist Jerry and I'm not a meteorologist but
[04:10:57.920 --> 04:11:04.680]  they've said that a hurricane could push this oil 20 30 miles inland up the
[04:11:04.680 --> 04:11:08.600]  estuaries back up the rivers and that a lot of it could be picked up in the
[04:11:08.600 --> 04:11:14.400]  storms and dumped in on the land the good news is the oil is biodegradable it
[04:11:14.400 --> 04:11:17.920]  does have some toxins in it but but there's all these millions of gallons
[04:11:17.920 --> 04:11:22.960]  of super toxic dispersant in it it's going to be very destructive Jerry it
[04:11:22.960 --> 04:11:27.120]  sounded like your phone was fading out are you still there yes I'm still here
[04:11:27.120 --> 04:11:31.920]  can you hear me yes I can Lindsay Williams comment on what Jerry was just
[04:11:31.920 --> 04:11:36.480]  saying well it's not the oil itself that has this kind of ready tent to it this
[04:11:36.480 --> 04:11:41.240]  most concerning to me is what the what else is coming out of that well in the
[04:11:41.240 --> 04:11:45.560]  way of gases toxic gases well that's right they keep saying it's oil but I mean
[04:11:45.560 --> 04:11:50.280]  oils can get all the way up to New York and all the way at these coasts to the
[04:11:50.280 --> 04:11:54.200]  United States of America well that's right because it's not just what can be
[04:11:54.200 --> 04:12:01.640]  blown in by hurricane they admit that that the the title forces you know go
[04:12:01.640 --> 04:12:13.760]  out of the Gulf around Florida in those channels and travels up these coast yes
[04:12:13.760 --> 04:12:19.040]  that's true in fact it is going to devastate the tourist trade I talked
[04:12:19.040 --> 04:12:24.260]  to a host the other day said that a guest had canceled would not be on his talk
[04:12:24.260 --> 04:12:30.720]  show that night I said why he says he's a tourist travel agent on the keys when
[04:12:30.720 --> 04:12:36.320]  they found out she was going to be on his show they threatened her and told her
[04:12:36.320 --> 04:12:40.920]  not to appear on any circumstances she called and canceled out as a guest yeah
[04:12:40.920 --> 04:12:47.040]  this thing is getting to the point that it's going to be I don't know what the
[04:12:47.040 --> 04:12:53.640]  effect will have which is not going to be pretty well I appreciate your call
[04:12:53.640 --> 04:12:58.080]  Jerry that's a very serious issue and the word I was looking for was ocean
[04:12:58.080 --> 04:13:03.000]  currents they know where the currents are going you know the current sometimes
[04:13:03.000 --> 04:13:09.720]  change a little bit but but but worldwide these currents for thousands of
[04:13:09.720 --> 04:13:13.480]  years have been very very accurate under the point in the Atlantic you know
[04:13:13.480 --> 04:13:17.280]  ships knew you go to this point you get in this current and it basically takes
[04:13:17.280 --> 04:13:21.880]  you here that's why sailing ships it might take them two weeks to cross the
[04:13:21.880 --> 04:13:25.360]  Atlantic but then it might take them six months to get back across because they
[04:13:25.360 --> 04:13:29.240]  didn't have favorable winds or currents and they know where those currents you
[04:13:29.240 --> 04:13:33.040]  here's the Gulf of Mexico you're watching on prison planet TV here's Texas
[04:13:33.040 --> 04:13:38.040]  Louisiana Mississippi Alabama Florida and the oil spills here off Mississippi and
[04:13:38.040 --> 04:13:44.360]  the currents go down around the keys past Cuba I mean boy Cuba and the keys are
[04:13:44.360 --> 04:13:47.480]  really going to get it and then it because most of the oil staying out to
[04:13:47.480 --> 04:13:52.600]  sea and then it's going to go up and then the currents come in very close to
[04:13:52.600 --> 04:13:57.760]  shore all the way up the east coast up to Canada and then up towards Greenland
[04:13:57.760 --> 04:14:01.760]  and Iceland and England and northern Europe and northern Europe is going to
[04:14:01.760 --> 04:14:05.320]  be hit by this stuff in three or four months and that oil well just keeps
[04:14:05.320 --> 04:14:10.400]  going and going and going and going there's just no telling the type of
[04:14:10.400 --> 04:14:15.520]  destruction it's going to cause and then the whole world is going to want the
[04:14:15.520 --> 04:14:19.960]  American taxpayer to pay you watch even though this is an international company
[04:14:19.960 --> 04:14:23.720]  that's why it's dangerous to be blaming England for this because if you can
[04:14:23.720 --> 04:14:27.080]  blame a nation then you can blame a government rather than blaming these
[04:14:27.080 --> 04:14:30.520]  globalist corporations that are literally destroying our national
[04:14:30.520 --> 04:14:33.700]  governments and I'm not defending our national governments they're criminal as
[04:14:33.700 --> 04:14:36.720]  well the point is these corporations are even more lawless
[04:14:36.720 --> 04:14:39.920]  let's talk to Dave in Arizona Dave you're on the air with Lindsay Williams go
[04:14:39.920 --> 04:14:40.480]  ahead
[04:14:40.480 --> 04:14:45.920]  hello Alex hello Lindsay this day about what I listen to you on 12.1 60
[04:14:45.920 --> 04:14:51.240]  Lindsay I have a question in reference to the nuclear option how many devices
[04:14:51.240 --> 04:14:57.880]  how deep would they go I assume that the nuclear devices would cause the the
[04:14:57.880 --> 04:15:02.200]  whole thing to cave in on itself would it cause a tsunami how big would the
[04:15:02.200 --> 04:15:07.200]  tsunami be and would there be any fallout some of those things they answered
[04:15:07.200 --> 04:15:11.400]  for me some they did not they merely said that they would angle drill down
[04:15:11.400 --> 04:15:15.200]  into the depth of the ocean now I'm standing you've got five thousand foot
[04:15:15.200 --> 04:15:18.700]  water here that they're gonna have to start with before they can even do that
[04:15:18.700 --> 04:15:23.200]  angle doing then when the angle drill down they would go down I don't know
[04:15:23.200 --> 04:15:27.520]  they did not say how deep and plant this nuclear device and if it would
[04:15:27.520 --> 04:15:35.040]  actually for should I say solidify the soil to the plant that hopefully it
[04:15:35.040 --> 04:15:42.560]  would close off all this tissue that has developed in this monstrous term that
[04:15:42.560 --> 04:15:47.000]  they have down that if they've hit that nobody's ever hit before so what the
[04:15:47.000 --> 04:15:50.640]  resource of this is going to be it's really an unknown world nobody has ever
[04:15:50.640 --> 04:16:02.160]  started this before does that answer your question okay I guess it does up next
[04:16:02.160 --> 04:16:07.040]  is Dave in Arizona Dave you're on the air with Lindsey Williams go ahead yeah
[04:16:07.040 --> 04:16:12.560]  oh it's dick in Nevada already went to Dave go ahead dick yeah hello good to
[04:16:12.560 --> 04:16:17.160]  talk to you guys I kind of curious that you know they started talking about this
[04:16:17.160 --> 04:16:22.960]  hooded thing and trying to capture and save some of this what a couple months
[04:16:22.960 --> 04:16:27.120]  ago and the use of other you know countries and ships so they could
[04:16:27.120 --> 04:16:31.320]  recover some of this stuff with the you know one to make an attempt at it sure
[04:16:31.320 --> 04:16:37.360]  seems like they're using this as a convenient crisis probably going to
[04:16:37.360 --> 04:16:41.520]  sacrifice BP in the process but in order to get this cap and trade or whatever
[04:16:41.520 --> 04:16:45.840]  tax are going to jam on us but with that hooded thing it seemed we likely would
[04:16:45.840 --> 04:16:51.640]  be able to pressurize and separate and save some of that oil plus be able to
[04:16:51.640 --> 04:16:56.280]  probably burn off the other gases and that and the poisonous stuff well they
[04:16:56.280 --> 04:17:02.120]  admit now that they aren't going to create a flare to burn off they were
[04:17:02.120 --> 04:17:06.480]  saying 10% of it and they say they've got a hood over it that's getting some of
[04:17:06.480 --> 04:17:12.600]  the oil there's just so much oil that it's basically trying to bail out a
[04:17:12.600 --> 04:17:18.120]  swimming pool using a teacup and the swimming pool is always being refilled
[04:17:18.120 --> 04:17:23.520]  as you're there with a teacup trying to capture it I mean engineering wise though
[04:17:23.520 --> 04:17:29.680]  it looks like it is a serious obstacle and expanding on that they did block the
[04:17:29.680 --> 04:17:34.800]  states Lindsey what's your take on that how they block the states one weekend
[04:17:34.800 --> 04:17:39.080]  the states were wanting to go block their estuaries and and protect the
[04:17:39.080 --> 04:17:43.820]  fisheries protect the key areas in Louisiana Mississippi and the feds did
[04:17:43.820 --> 04:17:47.840]  come in and say no wait for our response and did everything they could to block
[04:17:47.840 --> 04:17:51.880]  their response is that so there's a bigger disaster and the feds get more
[04:17:51.880 --> 04:17:56.840]  power as we saw the same thing with Katrina what's your view on that well
[04:17:56.840 --> 04:18:00.600]  it's unbelievable that the federal government can override the state
[04:18:00.600 --> 04:18:05.480]  governments like this so drives are being completely disregarded and I think
[04:18:05.480 --> 04:18:08.920]  it's an atrocity every single politician up there should be thrown out and
[04:18:08.920 --> 04:18:14.040]  we've got to start all over again yeah our agencies have become little hitlers
[04:18:14.040 --> 04:18:19.560]  and we're not even allowed states to do anything I think it's an atrocity it is
[04:18:19.560 --> 04:18:25.160]  all about power I appreciate the call dick anything else here's we need to get
[04:18:25.160 --> 04:18:29.440]  these corporate monopolies busted up and back to companies that are
[04:18:29.440 --> 04:18:33.640]  responsible and not be regionalized white one got BP out in the Gulf and
[04:18:33.640 --> 04:18:39.600]  running over a line of Alaska and stuff well notice it's BP who symbol is the
[04:18:39.600 --> 04:18:43.720]  green flower they're the ones always pushing the environmental tyranny and
[04:18:43.720 --> 04:18:48.560]  I I think they're behind it I mean they gave orders that they knew we're gonna
[04:18:48.560 --> 04:18:52.480]  cause an explosion their oil company workers are on record saying we knew
[04:18:52.480 --> 04:18:58.120]  this was gonna happen and you know they can say well we didn't do it on purpose
[04:18:58.120 --> 04:19:02.160]  but they knew drilling enough of these super deep wells that if they did this
[04:19:02.160 --> 04:19:10.200]  in an unconventional you know half you know what way a slip shot way that it
[04:19:10.200 --> 04:19:14.000]  was gonna result in this and now they're using it there's no doubt they're
[04:19:14.000 --> 04:19:18.040]  using it I appreciate your call good points dick Stuart in Virginia you're
[04:19:18.040 --> 04:19:22.480]  on the air with Lindsay Williams go ahead Stuart hey Alex the first time to
[04:19:22.480 --> 04:19:26.160]  talk to you you're an honorable guy doing a good job here thank you sir
[04:19:26.160 --> 04:19:32.160]  appreciated okay I'm sort of an inventor so I kind of have a lot of understanding
[04:19:32.160 --> 04:19:37.320]  mechanics and stuff like that and I remember I listened to these guys they
[04:19:37.320 --> 04:19:42.000]  had an interview on them from CNN and these guys that survived the blast or
[04:19:42.000 --> 04:19:46.400]  whatever and they asked that they asked them what did it sound like and one of
[04:19:46.400 --> 04:19:51.480]  the guys said it sounded like the tail of the beast or the devil the dragon
[04:19:51.480 --> 04:19:55.400]  himself now I'm not putting anything biblical into this but what I'm saying
[04:19:55.400 --> 04:20:00.680]  is he said this was a seasoned oil guy he said he never he was on the rig he
[04:20:00.680 --> 04:20:05.760]  never heard anything like this in his life he said it was like it was like
[04:20:05.760 --> 04:20:12.320]  the pit of hell was coming out of that thing when it was burning so I know at
[04:20:12.320 --> 04:20:16.280]  three that you think this well the pastor you think this well was he said
[04:20:16.280 --> 04:20:23.160]  it was 25,000 feet down yeah this well is five thousand feet in the ocean then
[04:20:23.160 --> 04:20:28.160]  when they began at the ocean floor they went between 25 and 30,000 feet when
[04:20:28.160 --> 04:20:33.000]  they hit this strata of oil but the reason this gentleman heard things like
[04:20:33.000 --> 04:20:36.600]  that there's never been heard before because from all the sources that I
[04:20:36.600 --> 04:20:41.080]  can talk with there has never been a well hit on the face of the earth it had
[04:20:41.080 --> 04:20:46.320]  between 20 and 70 thousand pounds per square inch of pressure this caused an
[04:20:46.320 --> 04:20:50.240]  explosion such as probably never been heard before well Lindsay I like your
[04:20:50.240 --> 04:20:56.240]  analogy of being in a jet airplane at 33,000 feet this well is 30,000 feet
[04:20:56.240 --> 04:20:59.880]  under the ocean floor 5,000 feet of water above it so that's a greater
[04:20:59.880 --> 04:21:05.040]  distance from being up in a jumbo jet looking down on mountains that look
[04:21:05.040 --> 04:21:11.320]  like little molehills I mean that is at a deep oil well and they're finding
[04:21:11.320 --> 04:21:19.120]  incredibly high-pressured oil and gas 25 30,000 feet down below the earth I
[04:21:19.120 --> 04:21:24.200]  mean there are so many mysteries of this world and who knows what they're
[04:21:24.200 --> 04:21:29.040]  going to tap into one day drilling into the earth I mean man knows so little and
[04:21:29.040 --> 04:21:33.400]  and look at this disaster and think about all the nanotech the genetic
[04:21:33.400 --> 04:21:38.400]  engineering the cross species manipulations all of the disasters
[04:21:38.400 --> 04:21:43.640]  they've had the Hadron supercollider over in CERN Switzerland where their own
[04:21:43.640 --> 04:21:46.880]  scientists say yeah there's a small chance it can make a black hole or a
[04:21:46.880 --> 04:21:54.320]  singularity or a strangelet and could destroy the earth I mean it's a
[04:21:54.320 --> 04:22:00.840]  recklessness and this just gives us an idea of bigger disasters to come as
[04:22:00.840 --> 04:22:08.680]  man's common sense doesn't match up to the incredible knowledge we've now gained
[04:22:08.680 --> 04:22:14.520]  but not just the knowledge the playing around in a fireworks factory with a
[04:22:14.520 --> 04:22:19.240]  flame thrower not not knowing what we're gonna hit what we're gonna catch
[04:22:19.240 --> 04:22:26.600]  on fire it seems like a ticking time bomb this is a super dude well please
[04:22:26.600 --> 04:22:31.480]  understand what BP has done here they were copying the Russians because they
[04:22:31.480 --> 04:22:36.320]  knew that they could become the leader of our production in the world next to
[04:22:36.320 --> 04:22:41.880]  Russia itself if they accomplish this super dude well they are treading into
[04:22:41.880 --> 04:22:46.680]  areas that humankind has never traded into before and the road and the Russians
[04:22:46.680 --> 04:22:50.760]  of course two weeks and of course the Russians two weeks ago released a film
[04:22:50.760 --> 04:22:55.200]  footage of them using a hydrogen bomb to put out one of these super deep wells
[04:22:55.200 --> 04:23:00.240]  on land so I mean it's one thing to put one out on land using a nuke it's
[04:23:00.240 --> 04:23:03.200]  another thing to do it in the ocean when you've already got all these fishers
[04:23:03.200 --> 04:23:06.920]  this will probably just blow a bigger hole and now you'll have a whole bunch
[04:23:06.920 --> 04:23:11.400]  of other strata of oil coming up out of it and then BP will get what it wants it
[04:23:11.400 --> 04:23:13.920]  will get its carbon tax then they've already said they're gonna create a
[04:23:13.920 --> 04:23:18.240]  subsidiary of BP this company will be allowed to implode and the money like
[04:23:18.240 --> 04:23:22.380]  Enron will move on to the next operation let's talk to David in Oregon
[04:23:22.380 --> 04:23:26.440]  David you're on the air with Lindsay Williams go ahead oh thank you I
[04:23:26.440 --> 04:23:32.040]  appreciated Alex and by the way my wife and I appreciate you very very much my
[04:23:32.040 --> 04:23:40.640]  question to you is and to Lindsay is as far as the oil well is concerned you
[04:23:40.640 --> 04:23:46.960]  know the the live BP broadcast that they have on the internet yes is that is
[04:23:46.960 --> 04:23:53.360]  that in fact of the oil of the oil wellhead they say it is they're such
[04:23:53.360 --> 04:23:58.520]  incredible liars who knows Lindsay that's right I agree exactly with what you
[04:23:58.520 --> 04:24:06.480]  said you cannot depend on anything they say but I think the answer is we don't
[04:24:06.480 --> 04:24:13.880]  know sir anything else I was asking was because I helped put the fires out in
[04:24:13.880 --> 04:24:20.440]  Kuwait and the the the oil well fires that we had over there of course were
[04:24:20.440 --> 04:24:25.440]  considerably different but I was looking at this the plumage coming off this
[04:24:25.440 --> 04:24:31.200]  head and I found it interesting that if it was I wanted it the distinction it
[04:24:31.200 --> 04:24:36.040]  when they broke the well when the well was was first that came in that it
[04:24:36.040 --> 04:24:42.280]  was that when it got the 70,000 pounds pressure or up to that or are they
[04:24:42.280 --> 04:24:45.960]  saying that it's 70,000 pounds of pressure now and the reason why I'm
[04:24:45.960 --> 04:24:50.680]  asking is because if you look at the pictures on the video you can see that
[04:24:50.680 --> 04:24:54.960]  there is there's all kinds of material floating around on the water if it was
[04:24:54.960 --> 04:25:00.440]  70,000 pound psi of oil pressure that was actually coming out of that head
[04:25:00.440 --> 04:25:05.440]  there would be so much turbulence the ROVs couldn't be around that and you
[04:25:05.440 --> 04:25:09.880]  can see that the stuff floating around in the water is just lightly
[04:25:09.880 --> 04:25:15.320]  going into the plume and coming out so I well that's a point I wanted to say and
[04:25:15.320 --> 04:25:18.560]  I'm really glad we're taking your calls on this and stay there because I want
[04:25:18.560 --> 04:25:23.720]  you to build up a counterpoint I'm no expert but I know it's under 5,000 feet
[04:25:23.720 --> 04:25:27.880]  of water so it's under incredible pressure and that might cause something
[04:25:27.880 --> 04:25:33.000]  coming out at a higher pressure to to at least look like it was moving slower but
[04:25:33.000 --> 04:25:37.520]  I don't understand all the hydrology so I'm just you know speculating here but
[04:25:37.520 --> 04:25:41.040]  this is a question I'm gonna expand on tomorrow and we'll open the phones up
[04:25:41.040 --> 04:25:46.120]  because it doesn't look like it's coming out with that much pressure it's just
[04:25:46.120 --> 04:25:52.320]  kind of you know coming out like it's you know 500 pounds of pressure I mean
[04:25:52.320 --> 04:25:56.240]  we've all seen water coming out of a water drain and if you put black dye in
[04:25:56.240 --> 04:26:04.240]  it would look about like this it doesn't look like it's these you know tens of
[04:26:04.240 --> 04:26:10.000]  thousands of barrels a day so that's a really good point and I've sat there so
[04:26:10.000 --> 04:26:17.000]  many times and watched the live wellhead cam and it just doesn't look like it's
[04:26:17.000 --> 04:26:21.600]  that much oil and I'm not saying versus what Lindsay source says tens of
[04:26:21.600 --> 04:26:25.440]  thousands of pounds of pressure or what the mainstream media is saying now that
[04:26:25.440 --> 04:26:32.240]  it's 60 plus million gallons or whatever day 60 something I mean it's all
[04:26:32.240 --> 04:26:35.840]  estimations Lindsay your comments on that it's a really good question yeah I
[04:26:35.840 --> 04:26:42.000]  did have an error plan that we responded to this I have not mentioned it
[04:26:42.000 --> 04:26:46.960]  before because I just noticed I think so this woman said to me he said I've
[04:26:46.960 --> 04:26:51.840]  watched those pictures now he's not with BP another oil company he said I have
[04:26:51.840 --> 04:26:55.920]  watched those pictures and he said they don't make any sense he said I can't
[04:26:55.920 --> 04:26:58.920]  believe that this is really the pictures of what's happening down that
[04:26:58.920 --> 04:27:04.720]  that wellhead that was his response and notice how the media is providing this
[04:27:04.720 --> 04:27:11.480]  video for us anything else caller yeah I'd like to say one more thing the
[04:27:11.480 --> 04:27:16.240]  noticing okay the video by the way which just went off the air but noticing in
[04:27:16.240 --> 04:27:21.760]  the video that the ROVs are moving around freely with free motion floating
[04:27:21.760 --> 04:27:24.840]  at will and so forth positioning themselves at different points around
[04:27:24.840 --> 04:27:29.280]  the well there's no turbulence to speak of that you can see in the area the
[04:27:29.280 --> 04:27:32.560]  stuff is coming out as we just spoke about but what's even more interesting
[04:27:32.560 --> 04:27:38.160]  is is that understanding that this well is at 4,900 feet there about almost a
[04:27:38.160 --> 04:27:43.840]  mile down considering the differential 70,000 pounds psi would give you about
[04:27:43.840 --> 04:27:50.000]  25 to 30 pound 35,000 pounds psi worth of differential and even at that depth
[04:27:50.000 --> 04:27:53.480]  you'd have turbulence beyond your imagination and I don't see anything
[04:27:53.480 --> 04:27:59.440]  like this so what I'm seeing here is a lie and I am an engineer this stuff here
[04:27:59.440 --> 04:28:03.800]  is stuff I've been doing for many many years I gave boosts and crutes and
[04:28:03.800 --> 04:28:09.520]  reded air the technology to put out the fires that you saw in Kuwait using the
[04:28:09.520 --> 04:28:12.920]  hydro tube with the nitrogen shower nozzle and the jet engines with the
[04:28:12.920 --> 04:28:18.520]  half-tracks back in 1990 this stuff that I'm seeing Alex is a lie and I think
[04:28:18.520 --> 04:28:22.680]  that the American people are being spoofed on this that's all I have to say
[04:28:22.680 --> 04:28:26.480]  well David don't hang up I mean I believe you sound very credible I like to
[04:28:26.480 --> 04:28:31.920]  have you on as a guest if you want to be not use your name just send us some
[04:28:31.920 --> 04:28:35.480]  basic credentials and then we can make up whatever name you like as long as I
[04:28:35.480 --> 04:28:39.280]  know that you are an engineer whose work with petroleum because these are the
[04:28:39.280 --> 04:28:44.560]  type of guests that I do want to get on the show and since you are an engineer
[04:28:44.560 --> 04:28:50.000]  perhaps you or others who do the calculation of okay you know they say
[04:28:50.000 --> 04:28:56.520]  X amount is coming out a day the wellhead is this diameter and so we
[04:28:56.520 --> 04:29:04.160]  should be able to calculate the rough PSI for what they claim is coming out and
[04:29:04.160 --> 04:29:10.240]  then visually calibrate that to the lack of turbulence that we see in these
[04:29:10.240 --> 04:29:17.480]  live webcam videos and that is a major story and needs to be looked at so can
[04:29:17.480 --> 04:29:21.400]  I put you on hold and and get your number and decide if you want to come
[04:29:21.400 --> 04:29:30.840]  on the show okay guys will you Matt will you get his number please and ask him if
[04:29:30.840 --> 04:29:35.640]  he wants to give us his full name or if he wants to just send us some
[04:29:35.640 --> 04:29:40.000]  credentials but let's not forget about this because I want to get him on in
[04:29:40.000 --> 04:29:43.920]  fact I want to get some petroleum engineers on who can analyze this and
[04:29:43.920 --> 04:29:47.120]  not just read what they're saying in the newspapers and a petroleum engineers
[04:29:47.120 --> 04:29:53.200]  are scared of being punished or persecuted by the oil industry email us
[04:29:53.200 --> 04:30:00.440]  at show tips at info wars.com and send us documentation of your name and who
[04:30:00.440 --> 04:30:03.960]  you really are and we'll hold that in confidence and you can come on and we
[04:30:03.960 --> 04:30:08.800]  can call you Mr. X Mr. Y Mr. C Mr. A whatever you like or make up a fake
[04:30:08.800 --> 04:30:12.640]  name for you as long as I know you're a real source because we're going to
[04:30:12.640 --> 04:30:16.400]  continue to cover this and we're gonna cover it more and more I've just seen a
[04:30:16.400 --> 04:30:20.400]  lot of oil spills I know they're not normally that big of a deal they hurt
[04:30:20.400 --> 04:30:25.120]  some of the people affected but the geopoliticals overall system it's not
[04:30:25.120 --> 04:30:29.440]  that big of an issue but the fact that this just continues and continues and
[04:30:29.440 --> 04:30:32.960]  now they want their carbon tax and now these companies dump their stock and
[04:30:32.960 --> 04:30:35.840]  all this happened we've been covering it since it happened but I'm gonna be
[04:30:35.840 --> 04:30:40.680]  covering it a lot more here while we cover other important news but that was
[04:30:40.680 --> 04:30:45.920]  an amazing phone call from David in Oregon wasn't it pastor? Very much so in
[04:30:45.920 --> 04:30:52.560]  fact I would love to hear his synopsis of all of this definitely that would make
[04:30:52.560 --> 04:30:56.560]  for a fascinating program Alex. Well we need to just do the calculation because
[04:30:56.560 --> 04:31:00.720]  it changes every day it seems to be doubling every week Lindsey do you have
[04:31:00.720 --> 04:31:04.960]  the numbers on what they claim what they estimate is coming out of that well
[04:31:04.960 --> 04:31:14.240]  a day right now? Well let's see yes I do Matt Simmons says 25,000 barrels a day
[04:31:14.240 --> 04:31:19.040]  now my sources did not say that my sources said there was somewhere in the
[04:31:19.040 --> 04:31:22.440]  neighborhood of let me go back to my note here real quick they didn't give
[04:31:22.440 --> 04:31:29.320]  anything near that I'll find them here in a moment they told me about the time
[04:31:29.320 --> 04:31:33.840]  they said we've been very conservative they said we can't afford to just to
[04:31:33.840 --> 04:31:37.880]  make more than what's there but I know but let's make the calculation and they
[04:31:37.880 --> 04:31:41.760]  say it's the year real fast to try to find it well I mean they're saying 20,000
[04:31:41.760 --> 04:31:50.920]  pounds of pressure. 20,000 gallons. Wait a minute okay they said the
[04:31:50.920 --> 04:31:58.280]  restricts my book said 3,000,000 gallons a day. Okay 4,000,000 gallons a day what is
[04:31:58.280 --> 04:32:02.760]  that? That's very conservative he said I'm taking the what we know to be the
[04:32:02.760 --> 04:32:08.320]  bottom of the turtle pole. But what does that calculate out to coming out of the
[04:32:08.320 --> 04:32:18.280]  wellhead a ruptured wellhead that size? 52 gallons to a barrel but Matt Simmons
[04:32:18.280 --> 04:32:21.800]  says a whole lot more than that as of this past week. Sure but I mean I think the
[04:32:21.800 --> 04:32:27.360]  larger issue is you look at that webcam that oil is not moving that fast it's
[04:32:27.360 --> 04:32:33.160]  kind of just. No it is not and one oil man has already questioned that with me and said
[04:32:33.160 --> 04:32:37.800]  that he couldn't believe what he's seeing on that webcam. Who knows it's
[04:32:37.800 --> 04:32:41.160]  probably a Pentagon production I mean the CIA admitted two weeks ago they
[04:32:41.160 --> 04:32:46.200]  create fake bin Laden videos and then they bragged and said we put fake videos
[04:32:46.200 --> 04:32:50.640]  on the news to manipulate you. I mean who knows it could be an Easter Bunny I
[04:32:50.640 --> 04:32:55.080]  mean that's the problem with these liars three more callers we're gonna let
[04:32:55.080 --> 04:32:59.600]  Lindsey go we appreciate all his time. David in New Jersey you're on the year.
[04:32:59.600 --> 04:33:06.440]  Hey Alex hey Lindsay how you doing? Good go ahead. I have two questions my first
[04:33:06.440 --> 04:33:11.640]  one was I was listening to George Norrie on YouTube and I just guessed on I don't
[04:33:11.640 --> 04:33:17.880]  know his name but he was saying about like this gas bubble forming around the
[04:33:17.880 --> 04:33:23.240]  oil well and that like if it explodes or like another explosion happens I could
[04:33:23.240 --> 04:33:28.000]  cause a tsunami I just wanted to know if you knew anything about that. Well I mean
[04:33:28.000 --> 04:33:31.760]  they did have declassified documents for the Australian British and US
[04:33:31.760 --> 04:33:38.000]  governments in the 50s looked at tsunami bombs where they could detonate bombs
[04:33:38.000 --> 04:33:44.360]  a bombs or hydrogen weapons and cause a tsunami and then cover up that it was a
[04:33:44.360 --> 04:33:52.360]  nuke but that was never used they claim but I have to say that to claim that a
[04:33:52.360 --> 04:33:59.400]  oil well explosion underwater would would would be one you know fraction of
[04:33:59.400 --> 04:34:05.080]  a thousandth of a you know even low yield you know say five megaton hydrogen
[04:34:05.080 --> 04:34:08.840]  bomb I think that sounds pretty ridiculous but who knows because people
[04:34:08.840 --> 04:34:14.120]  tend to get twisted what is said on talk shows and one aren't I asked Lindsey
[04:34:14.120 --> 04:34:17.400]  Williams earlier I should have brought this up during a break I said what did
[04:34:17.400 --> 04:34:22.120]  you say about who really controls the military and that the American people
[04:34:22.120 --> 04:34:25.120]  would be shocked if they knew who really controlled and he said no I never said
[04:34:25.120 --> 04:34:31.440]  that on that show and so people may have heard a caller or something but what
[04:34:31.440 --> 04:34:37.080]  about tsunamis you have any comments on that Lindsey not really I have heard the
[04:34:37.080 --> 04:34:40.920]  same room with that you've heard but they're again I go back to what I said
[04:34:40.920 --> 04:34:47.520]  earlier in the program I cannot operate on thanks for hope so here's so I have
[04:34:47.520 --> 04:34:51.320]  to go back to my informants to find it and none of them have indicated this to
[04:34:51.320 --> 04:34:55.880]  be the case I had heard about this big bubble it's down there I hope it's not
[04:34:55.880 --> 04:35:03.360]  so all right let's go ahead and take a few final phone calls here in this
[04:35:03.360 --> 04:35:11.560]  marathon transmission Jeff in Texas you're on the air hi I was I had heard
[04:35:11.560 --> 04:35:17.000]  when you said that this was a strata of oil that's correct that's what they
[04:35:17.000 --> 04:35:22.480]  call it was a strata of oil if they went into the fact that the undialed never
[04:35:22.480 --> 04:35:28.360]  penetrated before so my question is is kind of like in a hydraulic system where
[04:35:28.360 --> 04:35:34.600]  heated pressurized oil holds the force holds something up since they're
[04:35:34.600 --> 04:35:42.400]  depressurizing this strata can we expect to see earthquake in the outer rims of
[04:35:42.400 --> 04:35:46.960]  this strata well when you understand the magnitude of the size of the planet
[04:35:46.960 --> 04:35:53.400]  you know oil wells taking tens of millions of gallons of oil out from
[04:35:53.400 --> 04:35:58.840]  very deep it is negligible compared to the overall structure and you've got
[04:35:58.840 --> 04:36:03.880]  all these different strata you know natural gas is is in domes or it can
[04:36:03.880 --> 04:36:08.600]  even be in sand and then comes out of the rock and so you're in areas that are
[04:36:08.600 --> 04:36:11.680]  actually what you would think of as solid sand or rock I'm no engineer but
[04:36:11.680 --> 04:36:16.360]  I've read about it you've got oil wells that are shallower that have caused
[04:36:16.360 --> 04:36:23.800]  sinkholes to start sinkholes to to form so there is some evidence of that the
[04:36:23.800 --> 04:36:30.680]  Israelis admit that they've looked at detonating explosives in old oil wells
[04:36:30.680 --> 04:36:39.240]  to cause small earthquakes secretary of defense Cohen in April of 1997 admitted
[04:36:39.240 --> 04:36:43.600]  that our government and others do have tectonic earthquake weapons comments on
[04:36:43.600 --> 04:36:50.080]  that Lindsay Williams yeah there's got to be something taking place down there
[04:36:50.080 --> 04:36:55.400]  you know there again is hard supposition as far as I'm concerned because I
[04:36:55.400 --> 04:37:02.320]  haven't heard my my sources say this but you know that the disc group colors no
[04:37:02.320 --> 04:37:07.800]  telling what we just have to wait and see really absolutely caller does that
[04:37:07.800 --> 04:37:12.240]  answer your question yes it does thank you very much thank you Jeff I
[04:37:12.240 --> 04:37:17.640]  appreciate it and again we we can get engineers on here we can get scientists
[04:37:17.640 --> 04:37:21.840]  on we can get geologists hydrologists they're not gonna know all the answers
[04:37:21.840 --> 04:37:27.040]  because the world is so complex and they're drilling at depths I mean if I
[04:37:27.040 --> 04:37:31.440]  got a geologist on who say it worked in a certain area of say limestone County
[04:37:31.440 --> 04:37:38.760]  Texas and who'd worked there for 20 years drilling shallow and deep wells and I
[04:37:38.760 --> 04:37:42.680]  asked them questions about that area they could tell me with a lot of
[04:37:42.680 --> 04:37:46.680]  authority what was going on and what would probably happen but you start
[04:37:46.680 --> 04:37:51.000]  getting people out there that are drilling 30,000 feet under the ocean
[04:37:51.000 --> 04:37:56.240]  floor they don't know what's going on they don't understand it they're
[04:37:56.240 --> 04:38:00.200]  learning as they go along and that's what's so scary about this Lindsay
[04:38:00.200 --> 04:38:09.920]  is that the unknown literally just think about it for a moment even at Russia and
[04:38:09.920 --> 04:38:16.040]  they did not hit this oil pressure this is the unknown they don't know what to
[04:38:16.040 --> 04:38:21.840]  take of it and a lot of even though themselves are guessing well I just
[04:38:21.840 --> 04:38:25.240]  want to say this for take a final call I am humbled by all the listeners I'm
[04:38:25.240 --> 04:38:28.720]  humbled by everyone's support I'm humbled by people calling and asking me
[04:38:28.720 --> 04:38:31.800]  questions because somebody asked me about the Federal Reserve of the Second
[04:38:31.800 --> 04:38:38.000]  Amendment or the New World Order or Queen Beatrix of the Bilderberg group I
[04:38:38.000 --> 04:38:41.320]  can you know comment on that and I actually have done a little bit of
[04:38:41.320 --> 04:38:47.040]  study in oil wells and hydrology and drilling and but you know again the
[04:38:47.040 --> 04:38:52.800]  government doesn't know BP doesn't know and all they know how to do is put new
[04:38:52.800 --> 04:38:56.960]  taxes on us and take more of our freedoms and and now Hillary Clinton's on
[04:38:56.960 --> 04:39:03.120]  the drudge report Obama administration to sue Arizona over immigration law so
[04:39:03.120 --> 04:39:08.280]  more treason on that front let's take one final call and let Lindsay Williams
[04:39:08.280 --> 04:39:14.240]  go George in Connecticut you're on the year hi Lindsay I have three quick
[04:39:14.240 --> 04:39:18.920]  questions one with some of the secret technology that we have but drilling
[04:39:18.920 --> 04:39:22.720]  tunnels through the United States for trains or whatever they talk about on
[04:39:22.720 --> 04:39:27.200]  various other shows why can't they use something like that the other question is
[04:39:27.200 --> 04:39:31.600]  is there any way we can stop these people with their their carbon tax what
[04:39:31.600 --> 04:39:36.440]  ways can we sabotage their plans for 2010 or whatever whatever date they have
[04:39:36.440 --> 04:39:40.480]  and lastly this seems suicidal because the Chinese are waiting on the side I
[04:39:40.480 --> 04:39:44.440]  lived in Asia for a long time and they're just waiting for us to knock
[04:39:44.440 --> 04:39:48.560]  ourselves off so they can just pick up the pieces well we're flat on our back
[04:39:48.560 --> 04:39:53.600]  and if these idiots pull off this plan basically they're gonna just pound on
[04:39:53.600 --> 04:39:58.520]  us after we check asked ourselves into a corner well it is true the world's a
[04:39:58.520 --> 04:40:02.200]  very serious dangerous place and the elites we have are out of control in
[04:40:02.200 --> 04:40:07.280]  arrogant and some of it was declassified in the 50s that they had
[04:40:07.280 --> 04:40:15.000]  nuclear-powered giant underground tunneling machines that could you know
[04:40:15.000 --> 04:40:19.760]  in some cases what I read was tunnel up to a half mile a day depending on what
[04:40:19.760 --> 04:40:24.560]  type of rock they're going through but normally they drill those tunnels just a
[04:40:24.560 --> 04:40:28.160]  few hundred feet under the ground they're all over Austin they're out of the
[04:40:28.160 --> 04:40:31.640]  old Berkshram because it was the former sack command base they go out to Fort
[04:40:31.640 --> 04:40:35.760]  Hood there are underground bases and and that's part of the continuity of
[04:40:35.760 --> 04:40:40.440]  government program most of its secret but we know the program exists they do
[04:40:40.440 --> 04:40:47.160]  have a lot of you advanced technology but how do you get something like that
[04:40:47.160 --> 04:40:52.920]  to tunnel from whatever underground spur it's got all the way out to the Gulf
[04:40:52.920 --> 04:41:00.840]  of Mexico and then down to 25 30,000 feet you know the heats the pressures just
[04:41:00.840 --> 04:41:04.360]  like there's pressure involved with water on top of you there's pressure when
[04:41:04.360 --> 04:41:08.600]  you're underground I mean they've got mild deep mines in South Africa I've
[04:41:08.600 --> 04:41:12.880]  seen film footage of where it's 150 degrees and they've got giant air
[04:41:12.880 --> 04:41:16.800]  conditioners they lower down and even with those huge air conditioners that
[04:41:16.800 --> 04:41:23.400]  move with the miners mining diamonds and gold it's still 115 degrees and they've
[04:41:23.400 --> 04:41:27.200]  got to stand right in front of the air conditioner with it 150 degrees five
[04:41:27.200 --> 04:41:34.040]  feet away from them hacking out giant diamonds and gold I mean so again man
[04:41:34.040 --> 04:41:38.480]  is not all powerful man is not God we can barely go a mile down to get diamonds
[04:41:38.480 --> 04:41:47.000]  Lindsay Williams nothing is going to stop the elite timeline of 2012 except the
[04:41:47.000 --> 04:41:52.880]  providence of God I highly recommend you call on him on a regular basis and ask
[04:41:52.880 --> 04:41:57.280]  for his assistance well also highly recommend people get your DVD set
[04:41:57.280 --> 04:42:02.320]  breaking down all this and the latest audio CD and give that toll free number
[04:42:02.320 --> 04:42:04.960]  and website out again one more time Lindsay Williams
[04:42:04.960 --> 04:42:09.560]  toll free numbers operator standing by right now please copy these
[04:42:09.560 --> 04:42:13.760]  documentaries and give them out they are not copy written my toll free number
[04:42:13.760 --> 04:42:24.720]  is 8887996111 over on the web to prophecyclub.com
[04:42:24.720 --> 04:42:36.600]  I like why you know I don't oftentimes say things to you too much because you
[04:42:36.600 --> 04:42:41.000]  and I you know we are wrestling this business together but I have such a
[04:42:41.000 --> 04:42:45.600]  great admiration for what you're doing I appreciate you immensely you are
[04:42:45.600 --> 04:42:50.080]  reaching audiences that nobody else in America is reaching in a way that nobody
[04:42:50.080 --> 04:42:54.640]  else is doing it and I just say God bless you the real God the true and
[04:42:54.640 --> 04:42:58.240]  living God of the Bible and keep up the great work you're doing and I have a
[04:42:58.240 --> 04:43:02.600]  great admiration for you everybody out there you listen to Alex Jones every day
[04:43:02.600 --> 04:43:06.640]  and don't you miss a single program Lindsay I appreciate what you're doing as
[04:43:06.640 --> 04:43:10.160]  well and God bless you we're all trying to reach people together and just to
[04:43:10.160 --> 04:43:13.560]  question the system and try to somehow prepare ourselves as this world gets
[04:43:13.560 --> 04:43:18.080]  crazier and crazier and we can't do it without God and you're absolutely right
[04:43:18.080 --> 04:43:21.400]  at the end of the day to put it at God's feet as long as we do the right thing
[04:43:21.400 --> 04:43:26.160]  and just count on God I know I have faith that God will come through for us
[04:43:26.160 --> 04:43:30.320]  as a civilization as a society we'll talk to you again next week with another
[04:43:30.320 --> 04:43:35.200]  update Lindsay Williams thank you thank you Alex have a great day you bet I said
[04:43:35.200 --> 04:43:38.760]  I do 20 minutes overdrive we did 44 minutes of overdrive want to say great
[04:43:38.760 --> 04:43:43.400]  job to my crew to the Genesis Network to the folks that make info wars.com and
[04:43:43.400 --> 04:43:49.160]  prisonplanet.com possible I'll be back live tomorrow 11 a.m. central at info
[04:43:49.160 --> 04:43:54.760]  wars.com and on your local AM and FM dial whatever we do we know a carbon tax
[04:43:54.760 --> 04:43:59.280]  and more taxes on the American people in our faltering industry is not gonna
[04:43:59.280 --> 04:44:04.240]  fix this problem in the gulf and so we have that fight to deal with until next
[04:44:04.240 --> 04:44:20.280]  time Sianara Alex Jones signing off
