[00:00.000 --> 00:26.940]  the
[00:26.940 --> 00:33.020]  March 8th, 2020. I am your host Alex Jones. Thank you so much for joining us on this live
[00:34.300 --> 00:41.740]  unfiltered teleprompter free globalist talking point free transmission. I am your host Alex Jones.
[00:42.620 --> 00:50.860]  Okay. I intend to open the phones up coming up at the bottom of the hour today. And I obviously
[00:50.860 --> 01:01.580]  would be covering the waterfront with everyone here. We now see coronavirus shutting down
[01:01.580 --> 01:07.660]  entire countries, shutting down commerce out of China, creating a supply chain, mega massive
[01:10.540 --> 01:17.740]  nightmare. And we see the two camps, either people saying that this is
[01:17.740 --> 01:23.340]  no big deal in all hoax or people saying it's the end of the world. Well, we already know
[01:24.460 --> 01:28.620]  that with the supply chain and with what's happening to commerce and tourism, it's already
[01:28.620 --> 01:34.140]  really hurting the global economy. And we know that big leftist institutions like Big Tech and
[01:34.140 --> 01:39.740]  South by Southwest are canceling all these big events to create the precedent that Trump better
[01:39.740 --> 01:45.100]  cancel all these big events and cancel school coming up as the virus spreads the next two weeks
[01:45.100 --> 01:51.100]  to three months that really starts heating up in two weeks. If you look at all the growth models
[01:51.100 --> 01:56.940]  and spread models of the virus so that if Trump doesn't shut down the US economy,
[01:56.940 --> 02:02.860]  somehow it's his fault what happens to the economy. And we went back six weeks ago and said,
[02:02.860 --> 02:09.180]  this thing is synthetic. This thing is manmade. This thing is a big, big, big issue.
[02:09.180 --> 02:17.580]  And whether it's really a super deadly virus or not, it's being used for massive control.
[02:18.700 --> 02:22.860]  So there's no doubt that the response is a hoax. There's no doubt it's a media setup.
[02:22.860 --> 02:25.420]  It is no doubt it's manmade. That doesn't mean it doesn't kill people.
[02:25.980 --> 02:31.260]  But it is synthetic. So I've harped on that. I've spoken to that. And now we have all these big
[02:31.260 --> 02:39.980]  developments that we'll be getting to once we start the next segment.
[02:45.260 --> 02:55.420]  That said, we will then get into the ongoing spectacle of bizarreness that is the Democrat
[02:55.420 --> 03:02.780]  race now tightening down to Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. What a pair of miscreant criminals,
[03:03.420 --> 03:10.220]  one completely addled and in mid-stage dementia, got a bunch of those clips coming up,
[03:10.220 --> 03:14.460]  gaps every time he opens his mouth. And the other just a con man scammer,
[03:16.700 --> 03:19.980]  promising people things that are absolutely impossible to deliver.
[03:19.980 --> 03:25.660]  And the corporate media trying to wrap its mind around the fact that that's their two candidates,
[03:25.660 --> 03:33.340]  we've got that as well. Then we also have the news that Eric Prince has been behind a lot of
[03:33.340 --> 03:39.740]  funding and support and training for the folks over at Project Veritas. That's very interesting.
[03:39.740 --> 03:48.460]  I'm going to dig into that some. Stink, Uggur of the young turds has had a big flip out that's
[03:48.460 --> 03:53.260]  gone viral and it just illustrates how communist think everything supposedly works perfect
[03:54.300 --> 03:58.620]  in communist countries, but then they hate capitalist countries that actually work much,
[03:58.620 --> 04:03.660]  much better. He's had a complete public flip out. We're going to be getting to all that. Also,
[04:04.300 --> 04:13.580]  Greek border in flames as migrants keep trying to break through. So that's all coming up as the
[04:13.580 --> 04:22.220]  globalist launch their attack on the borders of Europe as well. 2020, just a few months into 2020.
[04:23.020 --> 04:27.980]  Just two months and eight days into 2020 is already shaping up to be spectacular in every way.
[04:28.940 --> 04:37.180]  None of it's going to be boring. It's going to be a wild year with only 239 days left until
[04:37.180 --> 04:44.060]  the historic election that has so much riding on it and make no mistake, it's now clear. Whatever's
[04:44.060 --> 04:49.580]  really behind this virus or how readily it really is, it is synthetic and it is designed to take
[04:49.580 --> 04:54.940]  down America and is the chai con response to them losing the trade war with the U.S. We'll be back
[04:54.940 --> 05:03.900]  in full wars.com. It's really smart to get high quality, storyable food and enforced toward

[06:22.060 --> 06:40.140]  studios. It's Alex Jones. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, welcome to this live Sunday,
[06:40.140 --> 06:45.900]  March 8 2020 worldwide transmission with 239 days out from the election.
[06:45.900 --> 06:55.660]  There is no longer any doubt coronavirus is going to be a massive seismic event. It already is.
[06:56.220 --> 07:01.900]  It's going to be extremely destructive and everybody better get buttoned down as they say.
[07:02.700 --> 07:09.660]  Italy restricts quarter of their population travel chaos CPAC virus nightmare CDC has only tested
[07:09.660 --> 07:18.860]  1,583 people read report.com has some of the best wide range reporting on what's going on.
[07:19.660 --> 07:24.620]  So does info wars.com and news wars.com. We're going to be covering all of that in detail and
[07:24.620 --> 07:28.940]  what I think is really going on and what's coming next in the next segment. Here's some of the
[07:28.940 --> 07:35.020]  headlines on that front. This is the one headline you really have as a takeaway. Americans divided
[07:35.020 --> 07:42.060]  on party lines over risk from coronavirus Reuters poll. So it's been made political
[07:42.060 --> 07:49.740]  from the beginning and I got to say it. Man, we called it like we had a crystal ball.
[07:52.220 --> 07:57.820]  So regardless of what's really going on with it, it's been made political. It was political
[07:57.820 --> 08:07.580]  from the beginning. It's pointed at America and knowing that we'll be half the battle. So that
[08:07.580 --> 08:14.460]  is coming up next segment of videos. It's like scenes from Mad Max movies. People clear shelves
[08:14.460 --> 08:21.260]  around the country. What did I tell you six weeks ago? I said you better buy storeable food because
[08:21.260 --> 08:25.820]  it's five times less expensive than store bought food. It's high quality. We have it in stock
[08:25.820 --> 08:30.940]  and it's only going to go up in value and a lot of folks ordered so they've already gotten their food.
[08:31.740 --> 08:35.980]  All the other major storeable food companies back then were sold out. We did some test orders
[08:35.980 --> 08:41.420]  with major names. Six weeks later, none of it came in. As our delivery time got longer,
[08:41.420 --> 08:44.620]  not because we don't have food, but because we have to package it and get it out at the big
[08:44.620 --> 08:49.180]  factories. I told you it was going to take six to eight weeks for delivery. It's really four to
[08:49.180 --> 08:56.860]  five weeks, but we say six to eight to under promise over deliver. The reason you have storeable food
[08:57.740 --> 09:04.300]  is because of the economy and wars or asteroids or earthquakes or tornadoes. It's just something
[09:04.300 --> 09:09.500]  good you have that last 25 years. It's sealed up in big plastic tote containers inside sealed bags
[09:09.500 --> 09:15.020]  inside. Just because of inflation, it's a good move to make. I have the biggest, most successful
[09:15.020 --> 09:19.020]  storeable food company in the world. It used to be like number two or number three and they explained
[09:19.020 --> 09:22.940]  to me, we're now number one and that's in the news they are because they have quality and they get
[09:22.940 --> 09:27.100]  it out to you and we're partnered with them. That's when you order at m4store.com off the full
[09:27.100 --> 09:33.100]  catalog. Get the best deal on my Patreon supply food. Like I told you, you're going to see what
[09:33.100 --> 09:40.540]  happened in China, duplicated and spread across the world because it's a globalist political
[09:40.540 --> 09:47.020]  attack on the nation state. This is a globalist temper tantrum because of patriots getting
[09:47.020 --> 09:51.660]  elected from Brazil to the US to the UK and the globalists being thrown out everywhere.
[09:51.660 --> 09:58.860]  This is their answer for a planetary corporate societal reset. Again, that's coming up next
[09:58.860 --> 10:03.660]  segment, but let me get to this right now. You know, I've talked a lot about the emblematic nature,
[10:03.660 --> 10:11.180]  the illustrative nature of Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. Two ages, 78 year old men,
[10:11.820 --> 10:23.180]  I guess Bernie's even older and 78, 79 and one of them has obvious dementia and cannot string
[10:23.180 --> 10:31.500]  a sentence together. The other is a con man, a flagrant liar and he just is saying the most
[10:31.500 --> 10:36.540]  insane things by the minute. There's like six or seven of them today. I can't even get to them all.
[10:36.540 --> 10:39.180]  He says there's no way they're going to win the election. I'll get to that in a moment.
[10:40.300 --> 10:44.780]  He doesn't know Obama's name. He doesn't call God, God. He says that thing.
[10:46.460 --> 10:52.220]  He doesn't. He thinks his wife's his daughter. I guess he does friends, kisses children. So
[10:53.740 --> 10:58.380]  but the fact that the establishment will be trying to run this guy and doesn't care what we
[10:58.380 --> 11:02.380]  think and it's so disconnected. Again, it's emblematic. It's like Bloomberg thought of
[11:02.380 --> 11:06.540]  he spent $500 million. People love him. Everybody hates Michael Bloomberg. The guy's a joke.
[11:08.860 --> 11:16.540]  So let's just play a few of these clips because again, this, this is a media and a corporate
[11:16.540 --> 11:22.300]  system and the chai comms and Democrat constituents. This is who the Democrats and the congressional
[11:22.300 --> 11:28.940]  black caucus and Kamala Harris are endorsing as if their endorsement means anything. When you give
[11:28.940 --> 11:34.220]  Nobel Peace Prizes to warmongers, it becomes a joke. When you endorse a gibbering idiot, it makes
[11:34.220 --> 11:41.580]  you a joke. Biden, we can only reelect Donald Trump. He goes on to say there's no way we can get
[11:41.580 --> 11:47.900]  elected. This is announcing. There's no way they can win. Here it is. Turn this primary from a
[11:47.900 --> 11:54.140]  campaign that's about negative attacks into one about what we're for, because we cannot get reelect.
[11:54.140 --> 11:59.100]  We cannot win this reelection. Excuse me. We can only reelect Donald Trump.
[12:00.700 --> 12:07.260]  I mean, it's sad. I remember my grandma when she was like 92 once a week going and having dinner
[12:07.260 --> 12:13.660]  with her sitting around the little table at her nursing home and watching her get to where
[12:13.660 --> 12:23.100]  she was half as adled as him. I mean, this is bad folks. But again, it's that the Democrats have
[12:23.100 --> 12:27.420]  endorsed it. They're supporting it. They believe this is going to be successful for them. It's
[12:27.420 --> 12:34.860]  beyond amazing. Here's another one. He also forgot Barack Obama's name. And then there's another
[12:34.860 --> 12:40.140]  clip again where he will get to all of them. Here he is not remembering Barack Obama's name.
[12:40.140 --> 12:47.340]  Because they invaded another country and annexed a significant portion of it called
[12:47.340 --> 12:54.700]  Crimean. He's saying that it was president. My boss. It was his fault.
[12:56.620 --> 13:01.500]  And again, it's not out of context. It's constant. Here it is. Biden calls himself an
[13:01.500 --> 13:10.860]  O Biden, Obama Democrat. Here it is. All of Amy's folks, all of Pete's folks, all of countless folks, all of the folks who have better folks.
[13:10.860 --> 13:17.100]  I tell you what, what a gigantic difference it's made. We're going to unite this party and unite this country.
[13:20.380 --> 13:27.180]  The folks who want to nominate a Democrat, a lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat,
[13:27.180 --> 13:37.020]  and a white Obama Democrat, join us. If you want to nominate, we'll bring the party together.
[13:37.580 --> 13:43.820]  We'll run a positive progressive vision for the future, not turn this Crimean into a
[13:43.820 --> 13:49.100]  campaign of negative attacks because that will only reelect Donald Trump if we go that route.
[13:49.740 --> 13:51.260]  If you want that, join us.
[13:51.260 --> 13:59.740]  So he's talking through another major stroke. He's had one that almost killed him before,
[13:59.740 --> 14:05.260]  but it's not just that the neurological control of his speech centers are out.
[14:05.260 --> 14:10.140]  The words are out too. So it's dementia. It's dementia on top of a stroke.
[14:10.860 --> 14:16.380]  And this is who they have walking into political machine gun fire of Donald Trump,
[14:16.380 --> 14:23.820]  who is going to massacre him politically in the election. But all I can say is,
[14:23.820 --> 14:30.620]  truth is my North Star. Trump about two years ago slurred his words, acted exhausted,
[14:30.620 --> 14:34.140]  stumbled around for a couple of weeks, and I thought they might have been drugging his food,
[14:34.140 --> 14:36.540]  remember? And then turned out they thought that might have been going on.
[14:37.740 --> 14:43.340]  That's how you get away with it, very small dosages. Well, he looks deflated and very tired
[14:43.340 --> 14:48.540]  and almost falling asleep at the podium. And my mom doesn't listen to my show.
[14:48.540 --> 14:51.420]  She can't handle it. So she didn't get this from me. She was over at the house
[14:53.500 --> 14:58.380]  Friday night and she said, man, he looks deflated. Like when people are giving speeches,
[14:58.380 --> 15:04.380]  he looks like he's falling asleep up there. So Trump is a million miles away from where Biden is.
[15:04.380 --> 15:09.740]  But at 73, my God, I'd be, I'm exhausted today. I've been up since 4 a.m. working.
[15:09.740 --> 15:14.620]  I couldn't imagine being 73 at Trump's job, but I always worry about him. And he is really
[15:14.620 --> 15:21.020]  puffed up, gained some weight and needs to take some time off to work out and needs to sleep
[15:21.020 --> 15:28.540]  more than four hours a night. Don't we all? But I'm worried about Trump. He is showing some signs
[15:28.540 --> 15:33.660]  of where and who would, but he's looking bad. I'll just, I mean, we're not in a cult here,
[15:33.660 --> 15:37.420]  man. I'll tell you, you know, eight months ago, I said, Biden's clearly had another stroke. He
[15:37.420 --> 15:42.460]  can't talk. He'll never finish the race. And in Facebook said, we're banning even using his name
[15:42.460 --> 15:47.740]  in a positive way, Alex Jones, because of that fake news. Give me a break. I called the emperors
[15:47.740 --> 15:56.220]  new clothes and I was right again info wars.com common sense today and tomorrow's news a year early.
[15:56.220 --> 16:05.900]  We'll be back. I always promote DNA Force Plus with PQQ and CoQ10 that cleans up the cells

[16:54.860 --> 17:00.620]  boosting you and your family's immune system infowarstore.com. Everybody needs food. I'm proud
[17:00.620 --> 17:05.340]  we're selling high quality food elections, globalism, the economy, the bubble. This is something you
[17:05.340 --> 17:11.180]  need on your checklist to have done. But for me, it just is a bummer to know that everybody needs
[17:11.180 --> 17:15.340]  food. And I had long discussions this morning over an hour long discussion with different
[17:15.340 --> 17:19.260]  individuals at different levels of this, right down to the folks run the plants to get the best
[17:19.260 --> 17:23.980]  idea we have. But they want me to say six to eight weeks just so people aren't getting pissed. But
[17:23.980 --> 17:29.020]  understand the last food company, the biggest food company is now at hundreds of times their
[17:29.020 --> 17:33.980]  regular order and they were having discussions with me about stopping the promotion of food sales
[17:33.980 --> 17:37.820]  next week. And at a certain point just saying we're done because people are going to take food
[17:37.820 --> 17:42.140]  orders out 10 weeks. We don't want to sit on your money 10 weeks and then just all the weirdness
[17:42.140 --> 17:46.140]  that comes with that because we're honest, under promise over deliver. But technically it's going
[17:46.140 --> 17:49.900]  to be six to eight weeks and we want you to get a great deal and feel like we took care of you.
[17:49.900 --> 17:54.140]  So you come back again. We want relationships with you. We're not Satanist. We're the opposite.
[17:54.140 --> 17:58.540]  We don't screw people over. We believe in Jesus Christ and we've been blessed by you. We're all
[17:58.540 --> 18:04.540]  in this together. If you understand why the globalist, why the servants of Satan hate info
[18:04.540 --> 18:12.220]  awards, it's because we're awake. We're alive. We're passionate and we're not giving up. That's
[18:12.220 --> 18:18.060]  why it's critical for those of us that are aware of the new orders plans to not get down when they
[18:18.060 --> 18:24.060]  attack us and they persecute us and they lie about us. That's what we should expect because we are
[18:24.060 --> 18:29.260]  hurting these scumbags. The globalists have literally sold their souls to the dark side
[18:29.260 --> 18:35.100]  and they do what they do because they're slaves because they are eternally driven to try to suppress
[18:35.100 --> 18:41.020]  and dominate and destroy the innocent. It is up to us who are awake, not the sheep and not the
[18:41.020 --> 18:48.940]  wolves, but the sheepdogs to stand firm and resist these wicked tyrants. They fear the fact that
[18:48.940 --> 18:55.980]  we are awake. They fear the fact that we are alive. They fear the fact that we love God and
[18:55.980 --> 19:05.500]  that's all we ever have to know is that God is in charge. Allergies, dander, asthma, germs, toxins.
[19:06.380 --> 19:10.060]  There are many reasons why we need to think about what is really in the air around us.
[19:10.620 --> 19:14.540]  We may not be able to stop breathing, but we can control what's in the air we breathe.
[19:14.540 --> 19:20.620]  The revolutionary Alexa Pure Breeze air filtration system is a powerful ally in the fight against

[20:24.780 --> 20:41.820]  Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen. You know, I'm going to get into the coronavirus and the
[20:41.820 --> 20:45.660]  second half of this segment and into the next segment and the last segment of this hour,
[20:45.660 --> 20:49.740]  and then I do intend to open the phones up for first-time callers on this Sunday
[20:49.740 --> 20:52.460]  to give you a chance to respond to what you really think is happening in the world,
[20:52.460 --> 20:58.300]  the Democratic Party and the economy and the attempts to blame America and Trump for the
[20:58.300 --> 21:02.620]  coronavirus and all the rest of it. But I want to get back to Joe Biden because
[21:04.220 --> 21:09.020]  you've got Joe Biden being endorsed by the Democratic Party and you've got them clearly
[21:09.020 --> 21:14.380]  trying to steal it from Bernie Sanders again, but Bernie Sanders really represents who the
[21:14.380 --> 21:24.540]  Democrats are and all the pre-goodies that are being offered. But it's all delusion. It's all
[21:24.540 --> 21:30.380]  lies and it only gets worse and worse from that point. But then you look at Brian Williams,
[21:30.380 --> 21:40.700]  a big Democrat. He was on TV just a few days ago on Thursday. We covered it on Friday on NBC
[21:40.700 --> 21:47.500]  where he anchors and he said, it's incredible. The math is amazing, but documented $500 million
[21:47.900 --> 21:54.380]  that was spent by Bloomberg would give every American $1 million. Well, there's not 500 Americans.
[21:54.380 --> 22:01.020]  There's 327 million and it turned out it was just a few dollars each person would get.
[22:01.820 --> 22:07.340]  But they defended it. The original article was in the Washington Post and said, who cares about
[22:07.340 --> 22:15.020]  math? Blah, blah, blah. That's done on purpose. That's psychological warfare. But if you're
[22:15.020 --> 22:22.940]  going to have a party of mentally handicapped people, a party of people of dementia and of people
[22:22.940 --> 22:29.740]  that have screen sickness and people that are in a mesmerized sleep-like state and run the
[22:29.740 --> 22:34.380]  gamut from mentally retarded from all the fluoride to just flat out out of their minds
[22:34.380 --> 22:40.780]  for mental illness, well, then you're going to have the leader of them being someone like them.
[22:41.820 --> 22:45.340]  You don't understand a word they say, but it doesn't matter if you can't understand what Joe
[22:45.340 --> 22:51.660]  Biden has to say because his followers are idiots. And so it just sounds like words to them.
[22:52.780 --> 23:00.220]  You know, take care of corn pop and the fly hairs and black kids roaches. And you can't
[23:00.220 --> 23:07.020]  beat Trump and I don't miss rep stop my wife. That's my daughter. I don't know who I am. I mean,
[23:07.020 --> 23:13.260]  those are real quotes, folks. And then you got Sanders going, white people don't know what it's
[23:13.260 --> 23:18.700]  like to be poor. We are going to take the rich people's money. You everything will be free.
[23:19.900 --> 23:23.900]  The rich people are offshore. You'll never get their money. They're funding socialism
[23:23.900 --> 23:30.380]  to control us. 9% of their wealth is made up stock market numbers leveraged.
[23:31.500 --> 23:37.260]  You take 2% out of any of these companies, they'll fold overnight. It's not real money.
[23:38.300 --> 23:46.060]  It's called Zimbabwean or Weimar Republic where wheelbarrows of cash can't buy you a cup of coffee.
[23:48.940 --> 23:53.660]  And so that's where all this is headed. And the left wants to destroy the confidence
[23:53.660 --> 23:57.420]  in the Ponzi scheme to bring it down. And they think there's going to be some giant red terror
[23:57.420 --> 24:01.820]  crisis they're going to manage. It's going to give them all this power and control when all their
[24:01.820 --> 24:07.980]  poop and needle and homeless ridden cities have been sucked by them already. They think they're
[24:07.980 --> 24:13.420]  going to manage the takeover of the biggest armed camp in the world of people that hate their guts.
[24:13.420 --> 24:19.580]  They are literally getting in a cave with a grizzly bear and slapping it upside the face over
[24:19.580 --> 24:26.460]  and over again. But again, they're a party led by a gibbering lying con man communist
[24:28.860 --> 24:33.980]  who said he dreams of raping 12-year-old girls and gang rapes. He writes news articles.
[24:33.980 --> 24:40.540]  I like to get what the male doesn't think about gang raping with 20 men, a 12-year-old girl.
[24:41.100 --> 24:48.780]  I want to see her bound. I'm going to rape her. And Sink Uggur or Sink Uggur has made
[24:48.780 --> 24:54.220]  similar comments online. And so have all these people. It's like, no, dude, the average man doesn't
[24:54.220 --> 25:00.700]  think about tying down 12-year-old girls and gang raping them, dude. That's you, bro. I like
[25:00.700 --> 25:08.540]  raping little kids. It's what I do. We understand, bro. So speaking of that,
[25:10.860 --> 25:15.420]  it's a long video. It's like 30 minutes long. It's on employers.com. Here's the short compilation.
[25:15.420 --> 25:20.700]  Sink Uggur, Sink Uggur, whatever his name is, freaks out at black airline employees over
[25:20.700 --> 25:25.900]  delayed flight. And look, I get getting mad over delayed flights. They're being told by the airline
[25:25.900 --> 25:30.300]  what's happening. They think they can fix a plane. Then it's another problem. A censor says something.
[25:30.300 --> 25:33.980]  We have some of the best airlines in the world. We have some of the best systems in the world.
[25:33.980 --> 25:37.980]  In communist countries, if a flight's delayed, you might be there two days. But they all want
[25:37.980 --> 25:42.940]  everything free. This guy's worth reported like $50 million. But he's a communist. So he's flipping
[25:42.940 --> 25:47.180]  out of American Airlines and screaming at them because they keep thinking they're going to
[25:47.180 --> 25:50.140]  have a plane and they don't. They're not just telling you they don't have a plane for no reason.
[25:50.700 --> 25:55.260]  So again, it's another spoiled rotten baby looking for it. The plane, the plane.
[25:59.740 --> 26:08.140]  We've been here three hours. And American Airlines sucks. They decided for whatever reason
[26:08.140 --> 26:12.940]  to screw everybody on this flight. It just frustrates me that some industries just get to
[26:12.940 --> 26:18.860]  screw you over and go, yeah, you got to fly at some point, right? And it's Gustavo. That's a
[26:18.860 --> 26:26.940]  TYG viewer. And I'm hungry and I'm tired. And so like, you know me, I get more agitated when I'm
[26:26.940 --> 26:33.820]  hungry and tired. So look, if you guys think this is bad, wait till if that plane doesn't
[26:33.820 --> 26:41.580]  actually come from the hangar in 20 minutes. Is the flight coming? Supervisors, the flight
[26:41.580 --> 26:48.220]  coming supervisor, you at least got to be honest. Is there a flight? Is there a plane? You got to
[26:48.220 --> 27:07.340]  be honest. Is there a plane? Is there a plane? Where is the plane? Where is the plane? Is there a
[27:07.340 --> 27:13.660]  plane? Where is it? Where is the plane? You know, but listen, if we just sit here and take it,
[27:13.660 --> 27:19.260]  they'd have us here until six in the morning, and then they'd fuck this even harder. Okay. So
[27:19.260 --> 27:24.380]  I need you're a supervisor, aren't you? Where's the plane? I'm not going to answer your question.
[27:24.380 --> 27:30.300]  No, I know because I've been here for four hours. Don't give me this. Where's the plane? Here, I got
[27:30.300 --> 27:35.180]  a question for you. When did you make the decision that we weren't going to have a plane? You know,
[27:35.180 --> 27:40.220]  when did you make that decision? Who made the decision? Who made the decision that we weren't
[27:40.220 --> 27:44.460]  going to have a plane? It's funny to you, right? It's not funny to us. Who made the decision? Who
[27:44.460 --> 27:49.260]  made the decision? That's right. Who made it? Well, who is it? That's what I'm asking. Who's fault
[27:49.260 --> 27:53.020]  is it? Who's fault is it? This goes on for too long. Now he tells you what he's really thinking
[27:53.020 --> 27:57.580]  about. So he wants to hurt innocent people that aren't running things. He's a communist. He does
[27:57.580 --> 28:01.580]  understand they're not in command. It's the engineers. They don't know why the planes broke
[28:01.580 --> 28:06.300]  and they're trying to fix this as quickly as possible. But now, back it up 10 seconds, he's
[28:06.300 --> 28:10.860]  about to tell you what he really wants to take care of. And that's animals. He wants to pleasure
[28:10.860 --> 28:18.380]  sexually, reportedly donkeys. Here it is. Is there a plane or a crew? Like 204, your plane is
[28:18.380 --> 28:24.060]  already on its way from the hangar. No, no, no, but they told us that four hours ago. Is it actually
[28:24.060 --> 28:29.980]  coming? Is it actually coming because I literally heard it was coming from the hangar three hours
[28:29.980 --> 28:39.020]  ago? I literally heard that. If I were the rule, the benevolent dictator of the world, I would
[28:39.020 --> 28:49.420]  legalize bestiality where you are giving. You are your pleasuring animal. You see what I'm saying?
[28:51.980 --> 28:56.460]  But he doesn't want to pleasure and just be nice to the poor people at the ticket counter
[28:56.460 --> 29:01.980]  who have not done anything wrong. Stay with us. Everybody's calling me. I'm getting constant
[29:01.980 --> 29:07.260]  streams of text messages and phone calls and family visiting the house saying, is coronavirus really
[29:07.260 --> 29:11.900]  deadly? How bad is it really? So I would encourage listeners, yes, go get high quality, swirable
[29:11.900 --> 29:15.580]  foods. We have the only company, the biggest in the nation that actually still has food. It does
[29:15.580 --> 29:18.780]  take five to eight weeks to get it to you because they got a package and they got the food. But I
[29:18.780 --> 29:23.260]  would encourage listeners to do the most important thing and that's drink purified water. That's a
[29:23.260 --> 29:27.260]  prey. That's get focused. That's not be stressed out because you're prepared and that's get DNA
[29:27.260 --> 29:32.140]  Force Plus, the PQQ and CoQ10 that cleans up the mitochondria and the cells and is the biggest
[29:32.140 --> 29:37.420]  immune booster you can engage in the X2, the X3, the foundation, everything. The Ultra 12 back in

[30:03.340 --> 30:07.980]  Owl killer in New Jersey. You're on the air. Go ahead. Alex. Hey, I just want to say it's great
[30:07.980 --> 30:11.660]  to be back once again and I've never gotten to do this, but I'm going to give you a shout out for
[30:11.660 --> 30:15.820]  your product. So that's super blue Florida free toothpaste and that's super blue whitening
[30:15.820 --> 30:19.900]  toothpaste is on another level. I use the one I use the super blue in the morning and then the
[30:19.900 --> 30:24.860]  whitening at night and it absorbs into your gum. It is by far the best product that I've ever used
[30:24.860 --> 30:29.260]  in my life. I literally just took turbo force on my way to the gym right now. I've had four shoulder
[30:29.260 --> 30:34.300]  surgeries and the back surgery and that body has made me feel better than any type of physical
[30:34.300 --> 30:37.660]  therapy or anything that I've ever done in my life. So I just want to get that out of the way.
[30:37.660 --> 30:42.060]  Support this man. Everything that he exposed. Nobody knew about the hemean grove. Nobody knew
[30:42.060 --> 30:47.820]  about fd. Nobody knew about build a bird. Nobody called 911 before it happened in July 2001. Go look
[30:47.820 --> 30:51.260]  it up yourself. Well, we try our best, sir. They definitely want us off the air without you
[30:51.260 --> 30:53.820]  or not here, but yeah, these are all great products. So thank you, sir.
[31:00.860 --> 31:03.980]  Hannah meant about pronouncing that right. What do you think is really going on and thanks for
[31:03.980 --> 31:07.820]  calling. So yes, I was in Costco a couple of weeks ago. I was getting ready. I went to buy a bunch
[31:07.820 --> 31:13.020]  of part of the paper and some things before crowds really hit and I had my phone, I had
[31:13.020 --> 31:17.260]  your show going on and sticking on my pocket so I could hear it. I wasn't using headphones. This lady
[31:17.260 --> 31:21.580]  starts says, who are you listening to? Who is that talking? I said, this is Alex Jones and she
[31:21.580 --> 31:27.180]  just got her eyes got wide open and she says, really? I thought he was off the air and I said,
[31:27.180 --> 31:31.420]  no. And I told her, I explained, you know, the whole situation and told her where to go. She
[31:31.420 --> 31:37.180]  wrote down, you know, band.video and also infowords.com and just said she's still on. I run into people
[31:37.180 --> 31:41.500]  at the grocery store at the mall on the hiking bike trail and they go, oh, Alex, I used to love
[31:41.500 --> 31:44.540]  you. I wish you were still on air. Are you ever going to go back on air? And I'm like, we're on
[31:44.540 --> 31:48.060]  hundreds of radio stations, over 100 TV stations and cable stations. We have our own streams at
[31:48.060 --> 31:52.460]  infowords.com and band.video and they go, really? They said you were off the air because they took
[31:52.460 --> 32:22.220]  the platforming as off the air. No, we have our own platform info wars, info wars, info wars, info wars, info wars, life.com info wars, life.com info wars, life.com info wars, life.com. You go to that URL. It takes you to the subsection of info wars store.com where you find the 60 plus products where we've gone out and researched what is the best, what gives people the best results. We either private label it or we develop our own with top developers.
[32:22.460 --> 32:50.460]  And folks, I'm telling you, you can see the difference in me, my energy, my focus. I've lost almost 40 pounds in less than four months. It's incredible. So do yourself a favor. Try out the products. If you've been on the fence, you can't lose, except if you don't take action. Because when you buy the products, you're funding the operation that is always delivering. Thanks to your support and God's grace and our action. But you need these products. That's the real reason you want to get them is because they're amazing. And then when you get great results, please tell other people that you need them.
[32:52.460 --> 33:00.300]  There's about a word of mouth. That's how we expand in the face of the NWO instead of imploding. We're fighting to win. And we are winning. Thanks to you.
[33:03.300 --> 33:06.140]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[33:06.140 --> 33:16.940]  When I grow up, I want to be a rock star.
[33:36.140 --> 33:46.140]  We now take you live to the Central Texas Command Center in the heart of the resistance.
[33:46.140 --> 34:04.140]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[34:04.140 --> 34:10.140]  We are live ladies and gentlemen on this Sunday, March 8, 2020 transmission and we're here because of you,
[34:10.140 --> 34:16.140]  and your word of mouth and your support and the great affiliates across the country and people telling folks
[34:16.140 --> 34:23.140]  about Bandot Video and newswars.com forward slash show.
[34:23.140 --> 34:29.140]  We're an American band. We're coming to your town.
[34:29.140 --> 34:33.140]  We're going to go after the globalists in a big way together.
[34:33.140 --> 34:41.140]  We'll win it, but the enemy is striking back.
[34:41.140 --> 34:46.140]  What we need is for young Chiquitas from Omaha.
[34:46.140 --> 34:51.140]  I'll just start saying the song.
[34:51.140 --> 34:54.140]  Feeling good, feeling right?
[34:54.140 --> 34:57.140]  Saturday night.
[34:57.140 --> 35:01.140]  Don't let the Gillette commercials see this or hear about it.
[35:01.140 --> 35:06.140]  They're going to tell us that we're not allowed to ask girls out.
[35:06.140 --> 35:11.140]  That's a bad thing, but if you're a convicted pedophile dressed in a clown suit and calling yourself a drag queen
[35:11.140 --> 35:17.140]  and you're unannounced brought to the school by other fellow pedophiles and small children bounce on your crotch
[35:17.140 --> 35:21.140]  and call it horsey, well, then it's okay.
[35:21.140 --> 35:24.140]  Yes, you cannot make this up.
[35:24.140 --> 35:32.140]  Let me get to the big, the big enchilada, the coronavirus.
[35:32.140 --> 35:36.140]  You know, one reason I've been successful in hindsight, I look back on because none of it was on purpose.
[35:36.140 --> 35:41.140]  It was just being truthful is that I cover a lot of diverse new news,
[35:41.140 --> 35:44.140]  but on things that I think are really important, I just am like a parrot.
[35:44.140 --> 35:49.140]  I'll just kind of add, by the way, they want your guns.
[35:49.140 --> 35:54.140]  By the way, they want your kids. By the way, they're lying to you.
[35:54.140 --> 35:58.140]  By the way, the vaccines are tainted. They have a secret vaccine damage fund.
[35:58.140 --> 36:02.140]  They pay out billions of dollars secretly. Its existence is admitted.
[36:02.140 --> 36:05.140]  Just the cases are secret. And I just chirp that out.
[36:05.140 --> 36:09.140]  Chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp, chirp.
[36:09.140 --> 36:14.140]  Little important bombshell factoids that I think are most important.
[36:14.140 --> 36:19.140]  Another big secret is, before there was the internet, there was talk radio.
[36:19.140 --> 36:24.140]  And that was the old fashioned internet where you just didn't call in.
[36:24.140 --> 36:28.140]  And that's the real secret ingredient is the callers.
[36:28.140 --> 36:32.140]  Because you bring in the wildcards, the knowledge of the crowd, and the great guests.
[36:32.140 --> 36:36.140]  So I want to open the phones up here for first time callers.
[36:36.140 --> 36:38.140]  I do that half the time. It's first time callers.
[36:38.140 --> 36:43.140]  So new people get a chance because we can have like 20 something thousand calls during a show
[36:43.140 --> 36:45.140]  because we have a computerized phone system. It shows 20,000.
[36:45.140 --> 36:48.140]  So that's crazy. There's a lot of folks that are regular who we love.
[36:48.140 --> 36:50.140]  But they're on speed dial.
[36:50.140 --> 36:52.140]  And there's a lot of people. We get it.
[36:52.140 --> 36:55.140]  You know, on a Sunday evening, they're sitting back knocking back a few brews.
[36:55.140 --> 36:58.140]  And they're on speed dial.
[36:58.140 --> 37:01.140]  You had more than six beers and I don't want to call in.
[37:01.140 --> 37:04.140]  Six beers today. That's the limit.
[37:04.140 --> 37:07.140]  Believe me, I get Sunday evenings back when I was a drinking man.
[37:07.140 --> 37:09.140]  You're not quit drinking totally for four months.
[37:09.140 --> 37:11.140]  Kind of started back a little bit, but now I'm phasing off of it.
[37:11.140 --> 37:15.140]  So I'm not judging anybody. I'm just saying here, ladies and gentlemen,
[37:15.140 --> 37:19.140]  that this is not the drinking hour.
[37:19.140 --> 37:22.140]  This is serious business. I'm not being patronizing.
[37:22.140 --> 37:27.140]  I'm telling myself that nobody wants to sail off into the sunset like I do.
[37:27.140 --> 37:29.140]  Believe me, but you know what?
[37:29.140 --> 37:32.140]  I'm going to hit coronavirus and we're very professional perspective
[37:32.140 --> 37:35.140]  and I'm going to get my guns loaded and I've got them loaded,
[37:35.140 --> 37:37.140]  but I kind of already started going off on other tanges.
[37:37.140 --> 37:42.140]  So let me, let me hit this important point, very important point
[37:42.140 --> 37:45.140]  beyond central, beyond paramount, beyond critical.
[37:45.140 --> 37:47.140]  If we don't have this, we have nothing.
[37:47.140 --> 37:51.140]  And then I'll come back and hit all of this and then take your calls in the entire second hour.
[37:51.140 --> 38:00.140]  The toll free number to join us on this live Sunday edition is 877789 Alex 8777892539
[38:00.140 --> 38:11.140]  international line dial the country code and 512-646-1776 that numbers 512-646-1776
[38:11.140 --> 38:15.140]  wherever you like it in Darth Vader voice, we can do that too.
[38:15.140 --> 38:19.140]  8777892539.
[38:19.140 --> 38:21.140]  We'll get you up and on the air.
[38:21.140 --> 38:26.140]  Perhaps Optimus Prime is how you'd like to hear it.
[38:26.140 --> 38:30.140]  East of the Rockies, that guy, that guy's got a cool voice.
[38:30.140 --> 38:34.140]  East of the Rockies 8777892539.
[38:34.140 --> 38:37.140]  Now we're imitating George Norian coast to coast to him.
[38:37.140 --> 38:45.140]  Autobots transform and call 8777892539 to destroy Megatron.
[38:45.140 --> 38:46.140]  All right.
[38:46.140 --> 38:48.140]  See, I want to have fun too.
[38:48.140 --> 38:50.140]  I get it.
[38:50.140 --> 38:53.140]  He deepened my cups on the beach fishing.
[38:53.140 --> 38:56.140]  Building sandcastles.
[38:56.140 --> 38:58.140]  My babies, that sounds good, doesn't it?
[38:58.140 --> 39:02.140]  But let me give you some good news here before I come back and hit the really bad news.
[39:02.140 --> 39:06.140]  But the good news that we know what the bad news is and we've got the jump on it and we're ahead of the curve
[39:06.140 --> 39:10.140]  because we've got the collars and the scientists and the researchers and our head in the game.
[39:10.140 --> 39:14.140]  And it's this.
[39:14.140 --> 39:20.140]  I never really want to talk about the successes of Info Wars because it sounds like we're just up here on a high horse
[39:20.140 --> 39:24.140]  saying, look how great we are. Look at all the wonderful things we've done.
[39:24.140 --> 39:27.140]  And that's not what's happening.
[39:27.140 --> 39:35.140]  I need to report to you the successes we've had in freedom against tyranny so that you know not how powerful I am,
[39:35.140 --> 39:43.140]  but so you know how weak and pathetic and undefendable and indefensible the globalist are.
[39:43.140 --> 39:52.140]  And finally, this is Raffecta, not how powerful Alex Jones is, but how unpowerful the globalist are
[39:52.140 --> 39:57.140]  when you have the facts and how powerful we are.
[39:57.140 --> 40:04.140]  Now I'm powerful with you. Now I'm powerful with God's help and justice and ideas and the truth and freedom together.
[40:04.140 --> 40:08.140]  Now we're powerful. Alex Jones isn't powerful.
[40:08.140 --> 40:12.140]  I've got a will and I don't want to be a slave and I'm willing to fight.
[40:12.140 --> 40:20.140]  I'm way more strong than the globalists, but they have got everybody hoodwinked and bamboozled, but not anymore.
[40:20.140 --> 40:27.140]  But we talk about the power, it's you and you need to start thinking about how truly important you are
[40:27.140 --> 40:34.140]  because garbage in, garbage out, but the spark of God and energy and truth and justice and the knowledge of good
[40:34.140 --> 40:39.140]  will elevate your psyche, your soul, your IQ, everything.
[40:39.140 --> 40:45.140]  And that's the big secret, but the globalists can activate a group residence to bring down our harmonics,
[40:45.140 --> 40:51.140]  which is a scientific thing, not some type of mojo or magic.
[40:51.140 --> 40:59.140]  There's an internet of minds connected, the group collective, they know how to jack into that and lower its frequency to control us,
[40:59.140 --> 41:03.140]  but God knows how and if we type into that to boost it.
[41:03.140 --> 41:07.140]  And so there's a battle right now between those two things, but I'm going to tell you.
[41:07.140 --> 41:14.140]  We are the zeitgeist, Info Wars is the flaming white hot tip of the spear.
[41:14.140 --> 41:22.140]  We together launched the entire anti-globalist nationalist movement worldwide and accredited by Nigel Farage,
[41:22.140 --> 41:30.140]  Donald Trump, Balasaro, everybody as being the detonator, the initiator and the enemy knows that too,
[41:30.140 --> 41:37.140]  but they come after us, us, the audience, myself together, us, the guest, the crew, all of us.
[41:37.140 --> 41:43.140]  And then we exposed the whole globalist operation, the pedophile rings and the New World Order,
[41:43.140 --> 41:50.140]  and now we're at the tip of the spear again, exposing this whole fake virus.
[41:50.140 --> 41:55.140]  It's a real virus, it's man-made, and the response is synthetic.
[41:55.140 --> 41:59.140]  And we're doing it again because God gave us the tools to fight evil.
[41:59.140 --> 42:03.140]  We just have to be directed towards God like the North Star, have the will, have the action,
[42:03.140 --> 42:08.140]  build and be steadfast and everything happens when you've done that.
[42:08.140 --> 42:11.140]  When you have the intellect, when you have the patience, when you have the spirit,
[42:11.140 --> 42:16.140]  when you have the community, the fertile soil, to do what we've done, it's incredible.
[42:16.140 --> 42:22.140]  And that's why the enemy wants to change the narrative and say we're racist or say we're this or say we're that
[42:22.140 --> 42:25.140]  or we're Russian agents because they know it's not true.
[42:25.140 --> 42:31.140]  We're the populist Americans unifying everyone around liberty and justice and God and family
[42:31.140 --> 42:34.140]  and we're the ones that have the power. You can look at us.
[42:34.140 --> 42:38.140]  We speak, we have strength, we have honor, we have will.
[42:38.140 --> 42:40.140]  We're not stumbling around like zombies.
[42:40.140 --> 42:44.140]  Liberty lovers, regardless of what color they are, have fire in their eyes.
[42:44.140 --> 42:50.140]  They're beautiful in what they say and do because we have God like we're a stained glass window
[42:50.140 --> 42:54.140]  shining through us, through that rose-colored darkly.
[42:54.140 --> 42:58.140]  It's incredible. We are the winners. We are the future.
[43:00.140 --> 43:04.140]  You want to break some globalist ribs. You want to crush some skulls politically.
[43:04.140 --> 43:07.140]  You want to drive ice picks through their eyeballs spiritually.
[43:07.140 --> 43:09.140]  There's nowhere you can spend money.
[43:09.140 --> 43:16.140]  There's nowhere you can place your bet in a fight where it's going to have more power per dollar.
[43:16.140 --> 43:24.140]  Your bang for your buck, beer, gets you great products at great prices that literally fund the system
[43:24.140 --> 43:27.140]  where the spirit of resistance lives to drive it home to the enemy.
[43:27.140 --> 43:32.140]  And so it's very simple. If you don't want to be slaves and you want to see the fight taken to the enemy,
[43:32.140 --> 43:35.140]  which God wants to see, you see, we have to make the effort.
[43:35.140 --> 43:38.140]  110% God will finish the move.
[43:38.140 --> 43:42.140]  And I know I need to stay in the fight in the attack, attack, attack.
[43:42.140 --> 43:44.140]  I want to attack. I want to go after the globalists.
[43:44.140 --> 43:48.140]  And just believe me, ladies and gentlemen, that if you want somebody to commit to you and your family to fight
[43:48.140 --> 43:51.140]  for all of our futures together, you've got to guarantee you keep me in the game.
[43:51.140 --> 43:56.140]  I'm going to bust my ass with everything I've got for us, for myself and my family, for your family,
[43:56.140 --> 44:25.140]  because we're in this together, infowarstore.com.

[46:00.140 --> 46:06.140]  We always promote being prepared, having firearms, knowing how to use them and being self-sufficient
[46:06.140 --> 46:10.140]  and learn how to hunt and learn how to garden. It's what we're meant to do.
[46:10.140 --> 46:13.140]  It feels good when we do it, but we do sell high-quality, swarble food.
[46:13.140 --> 46:16.140]  I told my patriot a month ago, I said, what can you handle?
[46:16.140 --> 46:19.140]  I said, I think it's going to be really big, and they said, well, we can handle probably this.
[46:19.140 --> 46:22.140]  We're not sure we're investing everything we've got to even pay it forward to be able to fund.
[46:22.140 --> 46:25.140]  I said, no, I think this is going to be huge, so that you should spend everything you have coming in
[46:25.140 --> 46:27.140]  to secure more food, even though the prices are going up for you.
[46:27.140 --> 46:29.140]  So those are the type of discussions we have.
[46:29.140 --> 46:31.140]  And I'm just giving the inside base of all of all of this.
[46:31.140 --> 46:35.140]  This is 100 times regular volume plus. It was 100 times a few days ago.
[46:35.140 --> 46:37.140]  That's about 200 times. Okay?
[46:37.140 --> 46:40.140]  At infowarstore.com, you go right in the queue, first come, first served.
[46:40.140 --> 46:44.140]  But the fact that the orders are so ultramassive, it's dizzying.
[46:44.140 --> 46:48.140]  I mean, this is just insane. We're expecting to have to put six to eight weeks to be safe.
[46:48.140 --> 46:53.140]  And then if it continues like this, we're looking at having to suspend food sales.
[46:53.140 --> 46:56.140]  But everybody gets their order in, we'll get your food, but that's how big this is.
[46:56.140 --> 47:06.140]  So what you're getting is 100% the straight deal of what's going on infowarstore.com.
[47:26.140 --> 47:39.140]  But if you're aware of the mind control, then you are able to be aware of its manipulations
[47:39.140 --> 47:41.140]  and you can train your mind to override it.
[47:41.140 --> 47:48.140]  And then just like mountain climbing or mountain biking or hiking or jogging or swimming or fighting,
[47:48.140 --> 47:51.140]  you get better and better and better and better and better at it.
[47:51.140 --> 47:55.140]  Instead of being oppressed by all of it, you learn to navigate it and make it a game.
[47:55.140 --> 47:57.140]  You're making a joke.
[47:57.140 --> 48:08.140]  And your brain learns to then not enjoy bad things happening, but really enjoy it.
[48:08.140 --> 48:12.140]  Like, you don't look for it and you don't like it, but then you do that alchemy where,
[48:12.140 --> 48:14.140]  oh, really, I enjoy this.
[48:14.140 --> 48:16.140]  And then that's when you really start overcoming.
[48:16.140 --> 48:21.140]  And that's when your brain starts going and really weaponizing, weaponizing.
[48:21.140 --> 48:25.140]  I mean, I can't even now after 25 years, 26 years of war with these people.
[48:25.140 --> 48:27.140]  It was longer than that, but I've been on there 26 years now.
[48:27.140 --> 48:33.140]  It's just like, my problem is, is that I can project into any problem or any operation
[48:33.140 --> 48:37.140]  and then have so many facts to draw on that it becomes exhausting
[48:37.140 --> 48:39.140]  because we're not omnipresent like God.
[48:39.140 --> 48:42.140]  We're able to look into any problem and do incredible things.
[48:42.140 --> 48:47.140]  We're supercomputers, electrochemical supercomputers, but still it's limited
[48:47.140 --> 48:49.140]  because you can look into any avenue.
[48:49.140 --> 48:53.140]  But you can't look into all avenues at the same time.
[48:53.140 --> 48:54.140]  Can you?
[48:54.140 --> 48:56.140]  You can probably do anything you want in life.
[48:56.140 --> 48:58.140]  You just can't do everything as they say.
[48:58.140 --> 49:00.140]  Okay.
[49:00.140 --> 49:10.140]  Let me do my best here to try to sum this up in a very calm way.
[49:10.140 --> 49:16.140]  9-11 was real.
[49:16.140 --> 49:25.140]  Planes flew into the Pentagon and flew into the World Trade Center's Tower 1 and 2.
[49:25.140 --> 49:29.140]  A large project, I'll hit the Pentagon and two planes at the towers.
[49:29.140 --> 49:30.140]  And I studied it and made five films.
[49:30.140 --> 49:34.140]  I written a book about it and interviewed NSA top people and CIA
[49:34.140 --> 49:40.140]  and firefighters and police that were there and it happened.
[49:40.140 --> 49:46.140]  When we exposed the fact that there were anomalies and cover-ups at stand-down,
[49:46.140 --> 49:53.140]  the media said, Alex Jones says nobody died of 9-11 and that no planes hit it.
[49:53.140 --> 49:57.140]  That was a minority of people seeing holograms that were put out there.
[49:57.140 --> 49:59.140]  We later learned most of them by the CIA.
[49:59.140 --> 50:03.140]  It came out to discredit the whole movement.
[50:03.140 --> 50:06.140]  And later there were even articles in the National Post in Canada where they admitted
[50:06.140 --> 50:09.140]  that leftist professors had gone out and done that because they thought it would damage
[50:09.140 --> 50:10.140]  the view of government.
[50:10.140 --> 50:13.140]  And so they thought it was the best thing to do was cover it up.
[50:13.140 --> 50:18.140]  So what do you do when I'm pointing out, hey, the head of the labor or transportation department
[50:18.140 --> 50:27.140]  said they were in the bunker and saw Dick Cheney order the stand-down, told Congress that.
[50:27.140 --> 50:34.140]  Well, you just say, well, Alex Jones says space beams blew it up.
[50:34.140 --> 50:39.140]  So why am I talking about coronavirus in 9-11?
[50:39.140 --> 50:41.140]  9-11 was real.
[50:41.140 --> 50:42.140]  It killed 3,000 people.
[50:42.140 --> 50:44.140]  It was a new Pearl Harbor.
[50:44.140 --> 50:46.140]  Radical Islam is real.
[50:46.140 --> 50:47.140]  They do attack people.
[50:47.140 --> 50:51.140]  They were involved.
[50:51.140 --> 50:57.140]  But piggybacked on the Islamists planning it were a bunch of shadowy agencies and globalist
[50:57.140 --> 51:02.140]  operations that ordered a stand-down and put bombs in the buildings and put bombs in building
[51:02.140 --> 51:12.140]  7 that was the second largest CIA headquarters in the world after Lainley, Virginia.
[51:12.140 --> 51:17.140]  And I interviewed the deputy head of emergency management and a week later he was dead.
[51:17.140 --> 51:18.140]  He said, yeah, there were bombs.
[51:18.140 --> 51:23.140]  They told us they were on the news saying we're going to blow up building 7 and then interviewed
[51:23.140 --> 51:26.140]  cops that said, yeah, it was over the Red Cross radios.
[51:26.140 --> 51:27.140]  Get back.
[51:27.140 --> 51:28.140]  They're going to blow up building 7.
[51:28.140 --> 51:31.140]  And then the media spun it that I said cops blew it up.
[51:31.140 --> 51:33.140]  The Red Cross didn't blow it up.
[51:33.140 --> 51:36.140]  Red Cross is the most secretive intelligence agency in the world.
[51:36.140 --> 51:37.140]  It's the oldest Western agency.
[51:37.140 --> 51:40.140]  It's about 700 years old at least.
[51:40.140 --> 51:42.140]  Well, the hospitalers are even older.
[51:42.140 --> 51:43.140]  That's where the hospital comes from.
[51:43.140 --> 51:45.140]  But that gets into a bunch of history.
[51:45.140 --> 51:47.140]  That's a Vatican secret society, the hospitalers.
[51:47.140 --> 51:50.140]  But who can go behind enemy lines?
[51:50.140 --> 51:52.140]  Doctors, emergency people, the Red Cross.
[51:52.140 --> 51:53.140]  You know, you don't attack them.
[51:53.140 --> 51:54.140]  But what is really the Red Cross?
[51:54.140 --> 51:55.140]  That was the Crusader Cross.
[51:55.140 --> 51:57.140]  I'm not saying the Crusaders did it.
[51:57.140 --> 52:00.140]  My point is I have the news clips.
[52:00.140 --> 52:02.140]  I've played them a hundred times.
[52:02.140 --> 52:04.140]  Anybody can pull them up.
[52:04.140 --> 52:06.140]  CNN on two channels.
[52:06.140 --> 52:10.140]  BBC on two channels saying we're going to blow up building 7
[52:10.140 --> 52:12.140]  so it doesn't fall.
[52:12.140 --> 52:15.140]  47-story building and hurt other buildings.
[52:15.140 --> 52:16.140]  I was driving that day.
[52:16.140 --> 52:18.140]  I've been on there all day long.
[52:18.140 --> 52:20.140]  I drove two miles to get a pizza.
[52:20.140 --> 52:23.140]  I'm listening to CBS radio back when we still had it 20 years ago.
[52:23.140 --> 52:26.140]  And they announced on CBS they're going to have a control demolition
[52:26.140 --> 52:28.140]  in five minutes.
[52:28.140 --> 52:31.140]  When I'm listening on the radio, they had a countdown.
[52:31.140 --> 52:35.140]  And they blew it up while I was eating pizza driving back.
[52:35.140 --> 52:37.140]  I run in on the microphone at my house.
[52:37.140 --> 52:40.140]  I was broadcasting on GCN like 20 hours live that day.
[52:40.140 --> 52:43.140]  And I run and I say, I just heard CBS say they blew up building 7.
[52:43.140 --> 52:44.140]  Solomon Brothers building.
[52:44.140 --> 52:45.140]  Everybody starts calling in.
[52:45.140 --> 52:46.140]  Yeah, we heard it too.
[52:46.140 --> 52:50.140]  But see, in 2001, nobody Internet archived live shows.
[52:50.140 --> 52:54.140]  And then it became a conspiracy theory that I had said that.
[52:54.140 --> 52:58.140]  And I had Mother Jones and Time Magazine attacking me and go,
[52:58.140 --> 53:01.140]  Jones claims a building was blown up.
[53:01.140 --> 53:03.140]  That's not true.
[53:03.140 --> 53:07.140]  Then about six years later, the globalists don't even think,
[53:07.140 --> 53:13.140]  BBC and all of them start releasing on 9-11, the archives of the full day.
[53:13.140 --> 53:15.140]  And guess what?
[53:15.140 --> 53:21.140]  CBS, CNN, BBC, ABC, MPR.
[53:21.140 --> 53:22.140]  I made a film about it.
[53:22.140 --> 53:23.140]  I have it all in there.
[53:23.140 --> 53:24.140]  It's a 30-month film.
[53:24.140 --> 53:29.140]  All announced that the government's going to blow up building 7.
[53:29.140 --> 53:32.140]  Now, I don't know what really went on with 9-11.
[53:32.140 --> 53:37.140]  I just know I was shoving pizza in my face driving home 60 miles an hour on streets
[53:37.140 --> 53:38.140]  that were 20 miles an hour.
[53:38.140 --> 53:42.140]  I mean, I shouldn't have been trying to get home to say, hey,
[53:42.140 --> 53:44.140]  they just blew up a building.
[53:44.140 --> 53:48.140]  You can't wire a building in a couple hours.
[53:48.140 --> 53:50.140]  So you're tuning in.
[53:50.140 --> 53:52.140]  You're saying, Alex, what's the deal with the coronavirus?
[53:52.140 --> 53:55.140]  And I'll get to all the technicals and go to your calls next hour.
[53:55.140 --> 53:59.140]  But this is what it has to do with it.
[53:59.140 --> 54:04.140]  I don't know exactly what happened with 9-11.
[54:04.140 --> 54:11.140]  I just know they blew up a 47-story building that day and then told us they never said it.
[54:11.140 --> 54:17.140]  And I've got all the newscasts saying it.
[54:17.140 --> 54:18.140]  And I've got newscasts.
[54:18.140 --> 54:25.140]  We jumped the gun an hour, 57 minutes, and said it had fallen before it did.
[54:25.140 --> 54:29.140]  Jane Graham here, the building has fallen to its exact footprint, pan-caking.
[54:29.140 --> 54:34.140]  The Solomon Brothers' 47 stories, that would be the tallest building anywhere on the West Coast,
[54:34.140 --> 54:37.140]  has fallen due to fires.
[54:37.140 --> 54:39.140]  Before that, they said, we're going to blow it up.
[54:39.140 --> 54:41.140]  She goes, no, actually, Dave, we're not blaming it up.
[54:41.140 --> 54:43.140]  It fell down.
[54:43.140 --> 54:45.140]  It's still standing.
[54:45.140 --> 54:49.140]  No building of that type had never fallen from fire.
[54:49.140 --> 54:53.140]  Under writer laboratories, all of them said it was impossible.
[54:53.140 --> 54:55.140]  You want me to play the news clips?
[54:55.140 --> 54:58.140]  I could play it where it's behind her and she says it's fallen down.
[54:58.140 --> 55:00.140]  Yeah, here it is.
[55:00.140 --> 55:05.140]  So this is the key to the riddle of the virus.
[55:05.140 --> 55:14.140]  I don't know exactly what's going on, but I know it's man-made with the HIV delivery system cut into it.
[55:14.140 --> 55:16.140]  And major universities have come out.
[55:16.140 --> 55:19.140]  And the Senate Intelligence Committee has come out and said that.
[55:19.140 --> 55:21.140]  And when we were reporting it six weeks ago, the news would go,
[55:21.140 --> 55:23.140]  Joe's needs to be shut down.
[55:23.140 --> 55:24.140]  No one's saying it.
[55:24.140 --> 55:26.140]  I have all the reports you've seen.
[55:26.140 --> 55:32.140]  Everybody knows this, but you're not supposed to go there.
[55:32.140 --> 55:36.140]  Yeah, there's the Indian University scan, but other universities found the same thing.
[55:36.140 --> 55:40.140]  Other universities found, they had even better scanners, electron microscopes,
[55:40.140 --> 55:43.140]  with the CRISPR to analyze what they scanned.
[55:43.140 --> 55:47.140]  And they said, it's got the protein injection points.
[55:47.140 --> 55:53.140]  The slices of when you plug it in, it leaves the resident.
[55:53.140 --> 55:57.140]  And it's exactly what the Indian University said.
[55:57.140 --> 55:59.140]  They got some of the top scientists as everybody knows.
[55:59.140 --> 56:02.140]  They said, this is like Frankenstein.
[56:02.140 --> 56:03.140]  It's cut in.
[56:03.140 --> 56:05.140]  It'd be like, I'm a white dude.
[56:05.140 --> 56:07.140]  If someone like grafted another head on, it was a black dude.
[56:07.140 --> 56:10.140]  You'd go, not only are you not supposed to have two heads, that's a black dude's head.
[56:10.140 --> 56:12.140]  That's not even the same thing.
[56:12.140 --> 56:13.140]  It's not even the same.
[56:13.140 --> 56:16.140]  I mean, folks, this is ridiculous.
[56:16.140 --> 56:19.140]  And then the hype and the unified propaganda.
[56:19.140 --> 56:23.140]  And I said, watch him say, Trump didn't do anything and use it against him and the economy.
[56:23.140 --> 56:26.140]  And now they're doing that.
[56:26.140 --> 56:27.140]  It's fake.
[56:27.140 --> 56:28.140]  It's staged.
[56:28.140 --> 56:29.140]  It's synthetic.
[56:29.140 --> 56:31.140]  Doesn't mean the virus doesn't kill.
[56:31.140 --> 56:32.140]  I'm saying it's manmade.
[56:32.140 --> 56:33.140]  It was released.
[56:33.140 --> 56:34.140]  It's all plotted.
[56:34.140 --> 56:35.140]  It's all planned.
[56:35.140 --> 56:37.140]  Italy and South by Southwest at Big Tech.
[56:37.140 --> 56:39.140]  They're all globalists, all leftists.
[56:39.140 --> 56:41.140]  Leftists now run Italy.
[56:41.140 --> 56:47.140]  They're all using this as a cover for globalist martial law worldwide to turn the public against each other
[56:47.140 --> 56:53.140]  and to create hysteria and fights as the cover for driving Trump from office and other nationalists.
[56:53.140 --> 56:54.140]  And that's what this is.
[56:54.140 --> 56:55.140]  It's conclusive.
[56:55.140 --> 56:58.140]  And you can set your watch and warrant by it.
[56:58.140 --> 57:00.140]  You can bet your bottom dollar on it.
[57:00.140 --> 57:04.140]  This is big, bigger than 9-11.
[57:04.140 --> 57:05.140]  Real people die.
[57:05.140 --> 57:07.140]  But it was all a big spectacle.
[57:07.140 --> 57:09.140]  One plane hits you, all tune in.
[57:09.140 --> 57:10.140]  Another plane hits when everybody's watching.
[57:10.140 --> 57:11.140]  Then they collapse.
[57:11.140 --> 57:16.140]  Then you're so stunned, you don't notice these other buildings blown up around it.
[57:16.140 --> 57:18.140]  And countdowns to blow them up.
[57:18.140 --> 57:21.140]  And then all the wars and the police stayed out of it.
[57:21.140 --> 57:24.140]  And now the Islamic invasion of Europe was supposed to stop all that.
[57:24.140 --> 57:26.140]  And you sit there and you watch it.
[57:26.140 --> 57:30.140]  You go, oh, well, this has been to change our way of life.
[57:30.140 --> 57:32.140]  It's been to totally take down the West.
[57:32.140 --> 57:36.140]  They were criticizing Trump just a month ago for trying to stop flights here.
[57:36.140 --> 57:42.140]  But the U.N. was praising China for killing people at checkpoints and praising Russia for closing their border.
[57:42.140 --> 57:44.140]  This was meant to hit us.
[57:44.140 --> 57:45.140]  We'll be right back.
[57:45.140 --> 57:46.140]  Hour number two.
[57:46.140 --> 57:49.140]  Stay with us and spread the word.
[57:49.140 --> 57:50.140]  Everybody's calling me.
[57:50.140 --> 57:55.140]  I'm getting constant streams of text messages and phone calls and family visiting the House
[57:55.140 --> 57:57.140]  saying, is coronavirus really deadly?
[57:57.140 --> 57:59.140]  How bad is it really?
[57:59.140 --> 58:02.140]  So I would encourage listeners, yes, go get high-quality, horrible foods.
[58:02.140 --> 58:05.140]  We have the only company, the biggest in the nation that actually still has food.
[58:05.140 --> 58:08.140]  It does take five to eight weeks to get it to you because they got a package.
[58:08.140 --> 58:09.140]  They got the food.
[58:09.140 --> 58:11.140]  But I would encourage listeners to do the most important thing.
[58:11.140 --> 58:13.140]  And that's drink purified water.
[58:13.140 --> 58:14.140]  That's prey.
[58:14.140 --> 58:15.140]  That's get focused.
[58:15.140 --> 58:16.140]  That's not be stressed out because you're prepared.
[58:16.140 --> 58:21.140]  And that's get DNA Force Plus, the PQQ and CoQ10 that cleans out the mitochondria and the cells
[58:21.140 --> 58:24.140]  and is the biggest immune booster you can engage in.
[58:24.140 --> 58:26.140]  The X2, the X3, the foundation, everything.

[58:30.140 --> 58:32.140]  It's still 50% off.
[58:32.140 --> 58:37.140]  Tumoric is known for doing a super job when it comes to cleaning out your cells.
[58:37.140 --> 58:39.140]  We have the strongest tumor you're going to find out there.
[58:39.140 --> 58:42.140]  95% humanoid from bodies, open tumor formula, that's back in stock.
[58:42.140 --> 58:46.140]  And purchases at m4store.com are the highest quality supplements, horrible food,

[58:56.140 --> 58:59.140]  and empowers the telomeres and the mitochondria.
[58:59.140 --> 59:05.140]  It's the most powerful formula out there sold over the counter that is known to energize the body.
[59:05.140 --> 59:08.140]  I'm not going to jack up prices during crisis, but I am going to end up running out.

[59:50.140 --> 59:55.140]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:00:20.140 --> 1:00:26.140]  You're listening to the voice of human resistance against the technotronic technocracy takeover.
[1:00:26.140 --> 1:00:27.140]  That's right.
[1:00:28.140 --> 1:00:30.140]  You're listening to Alex Jones.
[1:00:30.140 --> 1:00:35.140]  Burning inside, burning inside, burning inside.
[1:00:35.140 --> 1:00:47.140]  You're either alive and burning with liberty, or you're burning up with evil.
[1:00:47.140 --> 1:00:50.140]  Will these dreams still follow me?
[1:00:50.140 --> 1:00:53.140]  I'm a part of this trinity.
[1:00:54.140 --> 1:00:56.140]  Can't you see it off in the sky?
[1:00:56.140 --> 1:01:00.140]  I'm seeking you in the face at such a time.
[1:01:00.140 --> 1:01:02.140]  You never had the answer.
[1:01:02.140 --> 1:01:07.140]  You know, it's great we did inspire ministry in those last good albums they did,
[1:01:07.140 --> 1:01:10.140]  and we had a ministry on a few times.
[1:01:10.140 --> 1:01:14.140]  They say two people will survive a nuclear war, two things, that's cockroaches,
[1:01:14.140 --> 1:01:18.140]  the elite singer of ministry.
[1:01:18.140 --> 1:01:20.140]  Burning inside.
[1:01:20.140 --> 1:01:22.140]  Oh, here it is. Who's the best part?
[1:01:22.140 --> 1:01:24.140]  You have another line that comes in with this.
[1:01:24.140 --> 1:01:27.140]  It goes from the front lines of the information war.
[1:01:27.140 --> 1:01:29.140]  And then it goes in.
[1:01:29.140 --> 1:01:31.140]  Love it. We'll play that next time when we can.
[1:01:33.140 --> 1:01:36.140]  I'm going to keep listening to it so we have to turn it off.
[1:01:36.140 --> 1:01:40.140]  I've had some fun since junior high listening to ministry.
[1:01:40.140 --> 1:01:43.140]  I was a very good choir boy.
[1:01:44.140 --> 1:01:46.140]  I said all my prayers.
[1:01:46.140 --> 1:01:48.140]  It was always very good.
[1:01:48.140 --> 1:01:51.140]  I never had any fun listening to ministry.
[1:01:51.140 --> 1:01:55.140]  Grabbing through cornfields at 100 miles an hour in a Jeep when I was 12.
[1:01:55.140 --> 1:01:57.140]  All right, let's stop right there.
[1:01:57.140 --> 1:02:00.140]  And who knows what we were doing?
[1:02:00.140 --> 1:02:02.140]  We're not cool like Timothy Larry.
[1:02:02.140 --> 1:02:05.140]  Who knows what we were up to?
[1:02:05.140 --> 1:02:07.140]  I'm going to stop.
[1:02:07.140 --> 1:02:10.140]  Your calls are lined up and we really look forward to taking them.
[1:02:10.140 --> 1:02:13.140]  And I'll get to Craig and Brandon and Johnny.
[1:02:13.140 --> 1:02:15.140]  Great cousin named Johnny.
[1:02:15.140 --> 1:02:17.140]  Maybe that's Johnny from Texas.
[1:02:17.140 --> 1:02:23.140]  And Jim and Ron and Andy and Matt and Wesley and Paul and Taylor and Lisa.
[1:02:23.140 --> 1:02:28.140]  We're going to get to every single one of you here today.
[1:02:28.140 --> 1:02:32.140]  And then John bounce shot a first rate report that really needs to be seen.
[1:02:32.140 --> 1:02:36.140]  It's a band on video dealing with the fact that it could cripple our medical system.
[1:02:36.140 --> 1:02:39.140]  Coronavirus could implode the health care system.
[1:02:39.140 --> 1:02:43.140]  And that's really what it's designed to do, especially with what people demand here.
[1:02:43.140 --> 1:02:44.140]  They want so much in China.
[1:02:44.140 --> 1:02:50.140]  They just say, by the way, do we ever get the footage of the major apartment building collapsed in China?
[1:02:50.140 --> 1:02:57.140]  Were they were making coronavirus people quarantine?
[1:02:57.140 --> 1:02:59.140]  Like they probably blew that up.
[1:02:59.140 --> 1:03:05.140]  I mean, you don't just think a building just collapses because there's people inside and they're not letting them take the garbage out.
[1:03:05.140 --> 1:03:07.140]  How's garbage gets in?
[1:03:07.140 --> 1:03:08.140]  Garbage doesn't get out.
[1:03:08.140 --> 1:03:10.140]  Maybe there's so much garbage and they're the whole building collapsed.
[1:03:10.140 --> 1:03:11.140]  I don't know, man.
[1:03:11.140 --> 1:03:12.140]  All I know is all hell's breaking loose.
[1:03:12.140 --> 1:03:13.140]  There's another report.
[1:03:13.140 --> 1:03:14.140]  Gregory's did.
[1:03:14.140 --> 1:03:15.140]  They already aired during the week.
[1:03:15.140 --> 1:03:21.140]  But man, it is so good looking at how coronavirus is the death of globalism, not the death of the nation state.
[1:03:21.140 --> 1:03:27.140]  But they're trying to spin the whole thing like globalism is the answer.
[1:03:27.140 --> 1:03:28.140]  This is the big takeaway.
[1:03:28.140 --> 1:03:31.140]  This is a major world war event.
[1:03:31.140 --> 1:03:32.140]  This is 21st century warfare.
[1:03:32.140 --> 1:03:35.140]  This is how new wars are fought in the 21st century.
[1:03:35.140 --> 1:03:36.140]  It is manmade.
[1:03:36.140 --> 1:03:39.140]  And we need a major debate about that in the news.
[1:03:39.140 --> 1:03:52.140]  And we need that issue forced out into the open.
[1:03:52.140 --> 1:03:55.140]  We need that because they don't want us on air.
[1:03:55.140 --> 1:03:57.140]  They don't want you able to call in on air.
[1:03:57.140 --> 1:04:02.140]  And they're not being patronizing like they don't want you to be able to call in.
[1:04:02.140 --> 1:04:06.140]  The show's important because you guys bring up stuff that I never even would have thought of.
[1:04:06.140 --> 1:04:10.140]  Or I meant to cover and you bring it up right at the perfect time.
[1:04:10.140 --> 1:04:15.140]  That's why I'm trying to get the show more caller based because it's just amazing.
[1:04:15.140 --> 1:04:17.140]  Those are the shows I like to listen to and rebroadcast.
[1:04:17.140 --> 1:04:21.140]  All the frustration is I've got to add comments and you've got to add comments or add pleasantries.
[1:04:21.140 --> 1:04:23.140]  And then we don't get to everybody.
[1:04:23.140 --> 1:04:28.140]  So when we come back, I'll hit a few new items with the coronavirus.
[1:04:28.140 --> 1:04:29.140]  Give you my statements then.
[1:04:29.140 --> 1:04:30.140]  We're going to go to your phone calls.
[1:04:30.140 --> 1:04:33.140]  Bam, bam, bam, wham, slam.
[1:04:33.140 --> 1:04:34.140]  Thank you, ma'am.
[1:04:34.140 --> 1:04:36.140]  We're going to get to it.
[1:04:36.140 --> 1:04:41.140]  We have a lot of cable to fix here, as they say in the Big Lebowski.
[1:04:41.140 --> 1:04:42.140]  You know what?
[1:04:42.140 --> 1:04:43.140]  You can guess what happens next.
[1:04:43.140 --> 1:04:45.140]  Yeah, he fixes the cable.
[1:04:45.140 --> 1:04:48.140]  And I got to get out of here and go fix cable myself.
[1:04:48.140 --> 1:04:50.140]  I've done a lot of cable repair jobs today.
[1:04:50.140 --> 1:04:53.140]  Like a boxer, I probably should, but I admit it.
[1:04:53.140 --> 1:04:56.140]  The good Lord has given us a lot of good things in this world.
[1:04:56.140 --> 1:04:59.140]  And I am a cable man.
[1:04:59.140 --> 1:05:00.140]  Rich in Alabama.
[1:05:00.140 --> 1:05:01.140]  Rich, thanks for calling.
[1:05:01.140 --> 1:05:02.140]  Hi, Mr. Jones.
[1:05:02.140 --> 1:05:03.140]  Appreciate it.
[1:05:03.140 --> 1:05:05.140]  First thing, I love the turbo force.
[1:05:05.140 --> 1:05:09.140]  I drive truck for a living and it's amazing.
[1:05:09.140 --> 1:05:14.140]  Coffee kind of gives you a little crash there at the end, but that turbo force is amazing.
[1:05:14.140 --> 1:05:16.140]  How is turbo force different than coffee?
[1:05:16.140 --> 1:05:21.140]  I'll tell you what, it's sustainable anywhere from 18 hours.
[1:05:21.140 --> 1:05:24.140]  I don't feel the jitters like I do drinking coffee.
[1:05:24.140 --> 1:05:28.140]  And it's just, you know, at the end of the day, I don't need anything to go to bed.
[1:05:28.140 --> 1:05:32.140]  I'll, you know, I'll pop a knockout and I'm out cold.
[1:05:32.140 --> 1:05:35.140]  Well, that's what we went out to a top developer who did want his name on it.
[1:05:35.140 --> 1:05:39.140]  And I said, what would the ultimate long, say, 10-hour energy be?
[1:05:39.140 --> 1:05:44.140]  Is that possible that's good and clean and strong and has a bunch of different forms of energy
[1:05:44.140 --> 1:05:46.140]  that are healthy and natural that are time released.
[1:05:46.140 --> 1:05:50.140]  And there's more money in it than anybody else puts in their product.
[1:05:50.140 --> 1:05:53.140]  So that's why turbo force has such a great effect.
[1:05:53.140 --> 1:05:56.140]  And so I really appreciate you and I'm glad that you like turbo force.
[1:05:56.140 --> 1:05:59.140]  The Alex Jones Show
[1:05:59.140 --> 1:06:06.140]  A war on for your mind.
[1:06:06.140 --> 1:06:09.140]  The Alex Jones Show
[1:06:09.140 --> 1:06:12.140]  Because there is a war on for your mind.
[1:06:12.140 --> 1:06:19.140]  I am 100.
[1:06:19.140 --> 1:06:33.140]  2020 clear that the coronavirus has been made.
[1:06:33.140 --> 1:06:38.140]  The Communist China working with globalist clients and different factions launched it
[1:06:38.140 --> 1:06:43.140]  to cover up their defeat in the trade war, try to shut down Taiwan and try to embarrass
[1:06:43.140 --> 1:06:49.140]  President Trump and bring down the US economy.
[1:06:49.140 --> 1:06:53.140]  Because in the trade war with China, we brought down the errors because it was so one-sided
[1:06:53.140 --> 1:06:57.140]  because they were engaged in military operations financially against us.
[1:06:57.140 --> 1:07:01.140]  America is at war with Communist China with Hollywood in the left.
[1:07:01.140 --> 1:07:03.140]  They openly say America was never great.
[1:07:03.140 --> 1:07:05.140]  It will never be great.
[1:07:05.140 --> 1:07:11.140]  And anyone that sides with the chai cons or Hollywood blaming President Trump or blaming America with this virus
[1:07:11.140 --> 1:07:17.140]  is engaged in acts of aiding and abiding the enemy in a time of war.
[1:07:17.140 --> 1:07:19.140]  That's fact.
[1:07:19.140 --> 1:07:24.140]  You know, you've got your free speech all day and I back it 100%
[1:07:24.140 --> 1:07:32.140]  until you work for the Chinese, the Russians, the EU, some globalist operation.
[1:07:32.140 --> 1:07:36.140]  And if I found any evidence of Russians being involved in our business,
[1:07:36.140 --> 1:07:39.140]  I'd come after them so fast it'd make your head spin.
[1:07:39.140 --> 1:07:43.140]  Faster than that twinkle in your mother's eye when she met your father.
[1:07:43.140 --> 1:07:46.140]  I'm about as Russian as I am an Easter Bunny.
[1:07:46.140 --> 1:07:50.140]  They're not involved in anything but trying to stabilize their country
[1:07:50.140 --> 1:07:53.140]  and kick out the same globalist we're under attack by.
[1:07:53.140 --> 1:07:57.140]  So in that, Putin has been a trailblazer and I salute him for his fight for his nation
[1:07:57.140 --> 1:08:00.140]  and his people in fighting the sexualization of their children.
[1:08:00.140 --> 1:08:02.140]  And I wish Russia well.
[1:08:02.140 --> 1:08:04.140]  I wish the Chinese people well.
[1:08:04.140 --> 1:08:06.140]  They are under incredible communist control.
[1:08:06.140 --> 1:08:10.140]  Their governments killed more of their people than Hitler and Stalin and Mao.
[1:08:10.140 --> 1:08:14.140]  Well, Hitler and Stalin could ever imagine Mao killed 80 million of those or so,
[1:08:14.140 --> 1:08:16.140]  another 20 million or so.
[1:08:16.140 --> 1:08:19.140]  The Chinese government admits were killed by other Chinese communist leaders.
[1:08:19.140 --> 1:08:25.140]  But the chai comms have killed more than Hitler, Stalin, and Lenin combined.
[1:08:25.140 --> 1:08:27.140]  It's incredible.
[1:08:27.140 --> 1:08:30.140]  And it's just accepted now and of course it comes out in the news.
[1:08:30.140 --> 1:08:33.140]  That's Trump pushing back now.
[1:08:33.140 --> 1:08:43.140]  Nike and Apple have slave factories where 2 million Muslims are in slave camps in Mongolia.
[1:08:43.140 --> 1:08:47.140]  And again, I don't want to be under Islam, but I don't want to exterminate Muslims.
[1:08:47.140 --> 1:08:51.140]  And the Mongolian Muslims are like nice.
[1:08:51.140 --> 1:08:53.140]  And it's not their fault.
[1:08:53.140 --> 1:08:59.140]  800 years ago, Muslims came into Mongolia, took it over like Pakistan or other areas.
[1:08:59.140 --> 1:09:04.140]  They're not expansionists. They were doing crap to the chai comms.
[1:09:04.140 --> 1:09:09.140]  And the chai comms have 2 million of them in death camps with public executions on video.
[1:09:09.140 --> 1:09:13.140]  And they're making Apple accessories and Google accessories.
[1:09:13.140 --> 1:09:18.140]  And it's all just, oh well, it's okay because the head of Google is Indian.
[1:09:18.140 --> 1:09:22.140]  And you know, the head of Apple's gay is like, well, if you run death camps,
[1:09:22.140 --> 1:09:26.140]  as long as you hop around and go, ooh.
[1:09:26.140 --> 1:09:30.140]  Imagine you just run, you run giant death camps.
[1:09:30.140 --> 1:09:34.140]  If Hitler wore a pink outfit and like sashayed around like, ooh, I like weenies.
[1:09:34.140 --> 1:09:37.140]  Sorry, I'm ranting here, folks. I mean, I'm sorry.
[1:09:37.140 --> 1:09:42.140]  Seriously, if Hitler did gay porn, they'd say just murder everybody.
[1:09:42.140 --> 1:09:44.140]  Hell, son, go ahead.
[1:09:44.140 --> 1:09:49.140]  I mean, this is ridiculous.
[1:09:49.140 --> 1:09:55.140]  This is out of control.
[1:09:55.140 --> 1:10:00.140]  And it's not based in reality, but that shows how the left was successful approximation.
[1:10:00.140 --> 1:10:03.140]  The Bible talks about giving over to grand illusion.
[1:10:03.140 --> 1:10:09.140]  And once you accept that 2 plus 2 equals 10, well, you'll accept anything.
[1:10:09.140 --> 1:10:12.140]  And once you accept that a man can have a baby like CNN says,
[1:10:12.140 --> 1:10:16.140]  and once you accept that biological men can win the Olympic running
[1:10:16.140 --> 1:10:20.140]  and the high school and the college and the wrestling and the, and the,
[1:10:20.140 --> 1:10:26.140]  I mean, I've watched these videos of a huge like 270 pound dude that I'd be worried about
[1:10:26.140 --> 1:10:32.140]  just ramming down small women in rugby.
[1:10:32.140 --> 1:10:35.140]  And it's hailed as the most brave thing ever.
[1:10:35.140 --> 1:10:42.140]  Or in the UFC, a biological man gets in the ring and beats the snot out of women.
[1:10:42.140 --> 1:10:45.140]  I mean, breaks their jaws, their noses.
[1:10:45.140 --> 1:10:50.140]  It's just a man just like both fists together hammering women.
[1:10:50.140 --> 1:10:53.140]  And they go, oh, and I see the headlines.
[1:10:53.140 --> 1:10:58.140]  It's the most brave thing ever.
[1:10:58.140 --> 1:11:04.140]  If they can get you to accept that.
[1:11:04.140 --> 1:11:07.140]  Well, of course you're going to accept Joe Biden.
[1:11:07.140 --> 1:11:12.140]  And when Joe Biden goes live now on purpose, I tune in because it's,
[1:11:12.140 --> 1:11:16.140]  it's a gaffe every 10th, I mean, he can't talk.
[1:11:16.140 --> 1:11:23.140]  He's gone.
[1:11:23.140 --> 1:11:24.140]  And in what society?
[1:11:24.140 --> 1:11:26.140]  Yeah, roll some more of that footage.
[1:11:26.140 --> 1:11:32.140]  You have like six foot five dudes against five foot five women running them over,
[1:11:32.140 --> 1:11:36.140]  pushing them down to the ground and everyone calls them brave.
[1:11:36.140 --> 1:11:44.140]  And then there's men beating up on women tough only with the left.
[1:11:44.140 --> 1:11:46.140]  So we'll go to break in four minutes.
[1:11:46.140 --> 1:11:51.140]  I'll come back and go right to your calls to balance the transmission.
[1:11:51.140 --> 1:11:56.140]  Man, again, yes, it's hype.
[1:11:56.140 --> 1:12:01.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, that we should shut everything down,
[1:12:01.140 --> 1:12:03.140]  even if it's a 2% kill rate.
[1:12:03.140 --> 1:12:08.140]  That's probably exaggerating because it's only looking at people that were already sick in the hospital, whatever.
[1:12:08.140 --> 1:12:09.140]  You know why people are scared of it?
[1:12:09.140 --> 1:12:10.140]  It's manmade.
[1:12:10.140 --> 1:12:13.140]  It has the HIV delivery system on record.
[1:12:13.140 --> 1:12:14.140]  That's not debated.
[1:12:14.140 --> 1:12:21.140]  Like they go, oh, don't listen to Jones and the Senate Intelligence Committee and the Indian universities and the German universities and all these other ones.
[1:12:21.140 --> 1:12:24.140]  And the US universities that say, yeah, it's clearly manufactured.
[1:12:24.140 --> 1:12:32.140]  You can see, you know, the protein insertion points and the P shuttle and all of it.
[1:12:32.140 --> 1:12:33.140]  It gives a mark.
[1:12:33.140 --> 1:12:39.140]  It's got the trajectory, the rifling on it.
[1:12:39.140 --> 1:12:52.140]  But what is the response going to be and the supply chain and the breakdown of society?
[1:12:52.140 --> 1:12:59.140]  So yes, the enemy is hyping it to make it as worse as possible because they launched it.
[1:12:59.140 --> 1:13:02.140]  That's the most important thing I've said this month.
[1:13:02.140 --> 1:13:03.140]  I've tried to quantify this.
[1:13:03.140 --> 1:13:08.140]  Finally, I've just been literally racking my brain for days, trying to quantify this as simply as possible.
[1:13:08.140 --> 1:13:10.140]  I'm going to say it this way.
[1:13:10.140 --> 1:13:14.140]  The virus is real.
[1:13:14.140 --> 1:13:15.140]  It's the projectile.
[1:13:15.140 --> 1:13:21.140]  It's the weapon, both culturally, economically, spiritually and physically.
[1:13:21.140 --> 1:13:29.140]  But what's synthetic is the hype pushing the fear of the virus because that's the whole point of the virus.
[1:13:29.140 --> 1:13:35.140]  And so people think that you counter the virus by saying it's no big deal.
[1:13:35.140 --> 1:13:39.140]  But then you get set up with.
[1:13:39.140 --> 1:13:42.140]  You're the ones that covered it up and let it get out of control.
[1:13:42.140 --> 1:13:45.140]  You see the setup.
[1:13:45.140 --> 1:13:47.140]  So yeah, Trump sees it as it's manmade.
[1:13:47.140 --> 1:13:48.140]  It's hyped up.
[1:13:48.140 --> 1:13:49.140]  It's meant to create fear and panic.
[1:13:49.140 --> 1:13:52.140]  Well, you just counter that with no fear of panic.
[1:13:52.140 --> 1:13:58.140]  Except then when it turns out to be lethal and cause big problems and all these private corporations shut down all these events to create more panic,
[1:13:58.140 --> 1:14:02.140]  then they can blame you for not having a big enough response.
[1:14:02.140 --> 1:14:07.140]  And that's why the left soul lining up to have big giant responses so they can say they had the big giant response and Trump didn't.
[1:14:07.140 --> 1:14:09.140]  And that's in the Reuters poll.
[1:14:09.140 --> 1:14:10.140]  They're already phrasing it.
[1:14:10.140 --> 1:14:12.140]  Well, Democrats think it's the end of the world.
[1:14:12.140 --> 1:14:19.140]  Trump says it's fine.
[1:14:19.140 --> 1:14:23.140]  And so how do you simply quantify that?
[1:14:23.140 --> 1:14:25.140]  They're hyping the deadly virus.
[1:14:25.140 --> 1:14:26.140]  The global is the chikoms.
[1:14:26.140 --> 1:14:36.140]  The deep state are hyping the deadly virus that they engineered that they released that they let the chikoms incubate to then launch against us.
[1:14:36.140 --> 1:14:41.140]  The UN called for our borders and airplanes to stay open our airports while everybody else shut down that right.
[1:14:41.140 --> 1:14:42.140]  That was a big tell.
[1:14:42.140 --> 1:14:49.140]  And now sure enough, they're hoping it destroys the economy on every major so-called news program and on Bill Maher.
[1:14:49.140 --> 1:14:56.140]  And so Trump can't come out and say, oh, let me count of their hype of the virus by saying it's no big deal.
[1:14:56.140 --> 1:15:06.140]  It's a problem because when it becomes a real problem by the hype itself, he'll then be left holding the bag and look like he was behind the curveball instead of coming out and saying it's manmade.
[1:15:06.140 --> 1:15:08.140]  Obama sold it to him in 2015.
[1:15:08.140 --> 1:15:14.140]  Here's the Journal of Science freaking out about it.
[1:15:14.140 --> 1:15:19.140]  And China lied to us and didn't tell us it was this bad.
[1:15:19.140 --> 1:15:20.140]  It's all their fault.
[1:15:20.140 --> 1:15:21.140]  And you know what?
[1:15:21.140 --> 1:15:22.140]  Trump's listing.
[1:15:22.140 --> 1:15:23.140]  He started doing that Friday.
[1:15:23.140 --> 1:15:24.140]  So, you know, we're going to be okay.
[1:15:24.140 --> 1:15:28.140]  But let me tell you, that's why they want us off the air because I'm not trying to make myself important.
[1:15:28.140 --> 1:15:31.140]  I don't know why we're always the ones that are right.
[1:15:31.140 --> 1:15:36.140]  But I guess we're the ones that aren't controlled because all he's got is that swamp advising him.
[1:15:36.140 --> 1:15:45.140]  We will destroy the globalists together.
[1:15:45.140 --> 1:15:47.140]  God has sent us.
[1:15:47.140 --> 1:15:49.140]  God has sent you.
[1:15:49.140 --> 1:15:59.140]  So now tell the world you are the prophets.
[1:15:59.140 --> 1:16:02.140]  We know that the globalists are in trouble.
[1:16:02.140 --> 1:16:07.140]  We know they're going to strike back.
[1:16:07.140 --> 1:16:25.140]  And the U.N. has said that they're going to absolutely implode third world countries and then use those giant populations as weaponized hordes to come in and overwhelm the west and collapse our social services in a giant cloud and pivot program.
[1:16:25.140 --> 1:16:33.140]  The U.N. also has said they'll use mass plagues to make us capitulate to world government inner coronavirus.
[1:16:33.140 --> 1:16:42.140]  This is a critical year and it's a critical time to stay informed and to be spreading the word because people are waking up like never before.
[1:16:42.140 --> 1:16:57.140]  But this fight against tyranny is neck and neck so spread the word about band.video and info wars.com forward slash show. That is so important. You are at the center of the resistance. You are our only hope.
[1:16:57.140 --> 1:17:03.140]  I don't sell firearms, but I promote them constantly.
[1:17:03.140 --> 1:17:07.140]  Now could somebody listen to me and go out and buy a gun and use it wrong? Yeah.
[1:17:07.140 --> 1:17:15.140]  Just like I'm telling people, hey, I'm a man. I love women. You ought to go out and get a girlfriend. You may have problems with her. You may get a divorce. You may whatever.
[1:17:15.140 --> 1:17:20.140]  The point is, I'm just steering you in the direction I went that was successful and I loved.

[1:18:04.140 --> 1:18:10.140]  We run during the breaks a lot of news reports because I'm sick of hearing the ads.
[1:18:10.140 --> 1:18:15.140]  So you think you don't want to hear an ad? I don't want to hear an ad. But here's the bottom line.

[1:19:24.140 --> 1:19:30.140]  My friends, I harp and harp and harp about iodine because it's the good halogen, fluoride's the bad halogen.
[1:19:30.140 --> 1:19:42.140]  And people told me about it for years and I didn't listen and I'm so thankful that finally I listened to Dr. Grip like eight years ago and started taking true iodine, atomic iodine.

[1:20:22.140 --> 1:20:35.140]  From the front lines, oh yes, I've always wanted that and God gave it to me. Thank you God. Thank you!
[1:20:35.140 --> 1:21:01.140]  From the front lines of the information war, it's Alex Jones. What we are looking at is good and evil. Right and wrong. M4WareLife.
[1:21:01.140 --> 1:21:16.140]  But the Southern Barbie Law Center in ADL says there is no new world order. There is no replacement migration. There is no fluoride nor water. There is no secret vaccine damage fund.
[1:21:16.140 --> 1:21:44.140]  All right. I was brainstorming last segment. I'm going to say this to go to your calls. The hype, the propaganda, the unification, the choreography, the synchronization, the scripting of these globalist governments.
[1:21:44.140 --> 1:21:59.140]  Hollywood, the Chycoms, Big Tech, South by Southwest that I've, I mean, I know the people that run that anti-American scum of the earth. I mean, you talk about trash.
[1:21:59.140 --> 1:22:10.140]  And every group cancelling big events, every group hyping up into the world, Italy now run by socialist, is socialist and globalist and communist.
[1:22:10.140 --> 1:22:20.140]  To create the precedent that if you don't lock cities down, if you don't do all this, it's your fault you caused it to spread so that when Trump doesn't do it because he thinks it's hyped up,
[1:22:20.140 --> 1:22:30.140]  they can activate the left of sleeper cells to engage in violence and arson and all the things they admit they've been gearing up for all the Project Veritas undercover video and all the things we've seen.
[1:22:30.140 --> 1:22:31.140]  It's crazy.
[1:22:31.140 --> 1:22:41.140]  I went to a Bernie rally a few weeks ago, they attacked myself, Owen Troyer, bloody one of the security guys, which is like psychotic demons. They're all geared up and they've made their runs at Trump in America.
[1:22:41.140 --> 1:22:50.140]  And they're admitting they're going to use this against Trump as we predicted they would. How incredible is how transparent it is. I believe it's going to fail.
[1:22:50.140 --> 1:23:02.140]  But the president can't say we've had a perfect response to coronavirus with only a couple thousand people tested and everything's fine. And, you know, this is like the flu. No, the flu kills 110 to 1% maybe.
[1:23:02.140 --> 1:23:10.140]  The number is 2% with this right now. Probably that's probably hyped up because again, it's who comes to the hospital and who's already sick. That's still a high number, man.
[1:23:10.140 --> 1:23:20.140]  2% show up with this and they're dying. That's not good. You don't want this. Okay. So this thing's got some real punch behind it. Is it into the world? No.
[1:23:20.140 --> 1:23:30.140]  The real threat is the hype of it. And so it's out of that attack that we know this is the globalist move. It's completely obvious there's no debating it and it's man-made.
[1:23:30.140 --> 1:23:41.140]  Now, I've said that probably 20 times today and I'm going to stop. But if Trump doesn't get out ahead of this, I don't know. I'm not going to tell the president how he should do it. I know the president's smart and I lost more folks.
[1:23:41.140 --> 1:23:51.140]  I've been saying for over a month he better come out and point out that China lied about how bad it was up front. So that's why our response was sluggish. Pompeo did it Friday.
[1:23:51.140 --> 1:24:04.140]  And I know the White House listens. That's good. But this is not like me up here saying I'm the grand Karnak like on Johnny Garson where he'd hold up the envelope and say, here, let me see what it says. You know, no.
[1:24:04.140 --> 1:24:13.140]  The Democrats are foaming at the mouth wanting a recession foaming at the mouth to blame this. So it's our salutes.
[1:24:13.140 --> 1:24:23.140]  Trump gets out ahead of it and says, well, we don't want quarantines. We don't want mass shutdowns, but we may have to. FEMA's already preparing for that. So he's out ahead of it.
[1:24:23.140 --> 1:24:33.140]  All right. I'm going to leave it at this. I already sell the very best supplements and products out there that have been documented and proven to abuse immunity.
[1:24:33.140 --> 1:24:43.140]  The PQQ CoQ 10 are on record. You can make claims on those because they're seen basically as drugs, but they're over the counter. They clean out your cells. They regrow mitochondria.
[1:24:43.140 --> 1:24:51.140]  They make telomeres last longer. We have the highest quality you're going to find a PQQ and CoQ 10 with other known compounds that boost it in DNA force plus.
[1:24:51.140 --> 1:24:58.140]  And it's an info or store.com 40% off and sold out for months is back in. We're going to probably solve it very quick. I'm going to keep it at 40% off.
[1:24:58.140 --> 1:25:07.140]  Our super silver wound gel is patented American nanotech organization sold over the counter approved for over the counter. We're the only folks a lot of private label it. We have it.
[1:25:07.140 --> 1:25:17.140]  And it's an info or store.com. We have the nano silver in the super silver toothpaste, the white toothpaste and in the super blue toothpaste that's tea tree and iodine as well.
[1:25:17.140 --> 1:25:30.140]  All of that strengthens the body's main barrier to disease. And that's the mouth into the esophageal and into the lungs as well and the breathing canal there. So it's all there.
[1:25:30.140 --> 1:25:39.140]  Ladies and gentlemen, info or store.com. Even though I'm close to selling out of the super silver, we've still got super blue. I'm keeping it at 50% off till they sell out.
[1:25:39.140 --> 1:25:56.140]  More is coming in. It looks like in the middle of April, the immune gargle sold out. And Walmart went and ordered 2 million things of it. I was told last week from our supplier that private label for them and Walmart's going to have it in a month or so.
[1:25:56.140 --> 1:26:04.140]  We have it back in next week. But see how we're trailblazing. What we sell gets picked up and put out by Walmart. I mean, because if this is a real deal folks is nano silver.
[1:26:04.140 --> 1:26:16.140]  So that's the the 18 wheelers roll out from Denver on Tuesday. We'll have it back in stock on Friday. But we're cutting edge. Everything we do. I mean, it's just it's true because we're not control folks.
[1:26:16.140 --> 1:26:24.140]  There's no teleprompter up here. I'm not getting orders from headquarters. I'm researching and having guests on and taking calls and just just living my life. I'm I'm in command.
[1:26:24.140 --> 1:26:34.140]  Just like you're in command when you don't follow what the globalists just say is the edict. Now the world works. That's how you change the world. And that is so incredibly beautiful.
[1:26:34.140 --> 1:26:44.140]  So enforce where I come. Okay, let's take a call right now. Who's up first guys who we're saying go to first.
[1:26:44.140 --> 1:26:52.140]  Okay, let's go ahead and go to Joe Anna in Texas. You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[1:26:52.140 --> 1:27:04.140]  So I just want to say the local news is saying that there are no cases of coronavirus in North Texas. But we went to medical city Dallas yesterday and first thing we notice is the quarantine area.
[1:27:04.140 --> 1:27:14.140]  And then later my dad was speaking to a lady who later told him that her daughter is there with the coronavirus, which you know he about had a heart attack when you heard that.
[1:27:14.140 --> 1:27:25.140]  Oh, yeah, well, look, I mean, look, I don't like cover ups because I think they always backfire. But but there's a giant cover up. They're not putting out the testing. They're covering up. Absolutely.
[1:27:25.140 --> 1:27:27.140]  Coronavirus is all over the place.
[1:27:27.140 --> 1:27:37.140]  Right. And we were going to go back so you're up in Dallas. He said medical city and and then your and your dad's told Oh, yeah, people are in there with coronavirus.
[1:27:37.140 --> 1:27:49.140]  Yeah, we were later told that they already have 20 people there with different strains of coronavirus. So was that a janitor saying that or was that a nurse your dad talked to was that an authoritative source.
[1:27:49.140 --> 1:27:53.140]  Well, he they've been in the ICU for about three weeks already.
[1:27:53.140 --> 1:28:06.140]  Oh, well, so your dad's in the ICU and they're telling him that Wow, that's that's authoritative. Yeah, what do they tell her specifically. Let me stop interrupting hold music, please. What what do they tell your dad.
[1:28:06.140 --> 1:28:18.140]  I mean, he was basically told by a lady that, you know, her daughter is there sick with the coronavirus. And then I'm assuming she's the same one who told him they already have 20 people there.
[1:28:18.140 --> 1:28:29.140]  Well, let me tell you, five weeks ago, I was told by a White House source that they already had FEMA in place and Seattle's the epicenter and they were already ready and that it already broke containment.
[1:28:29.140 --> 1:28:37.140]  What Trump would do would try to stop panic. And it was, what is he supposed to do? I mean, it's already out. We just don't need to panic because there's nothing you can do at this point.
[1:28:37.140 --> 1:28:48.140]  We're just going to roll the dice and find out how bad it is. I mean, I think Trump's right. Actually, while people are criticizing Trump, I just think he needs to be honest about the fact that it probably is really bad.
[1:28:48.140 --> 1:28:51.140]  And then everybody's ready for what's coming instead of panicking and losing confidence.
[1:28:51.140 --> 1:28:59.140]  If you don't need God bless you, hope your dad gets better. All right, I'm coming right back and I promise I'm going bam, bam, bam to your calls. Everybody's calling me.
[1:28:59.140 --> 1:29:07.140]  I'm getting constant streams of text messages and phone calls and family visiting the house saying, is coronavirus really deadly? How bad is it really?
[1:29:07.140 --> 1:29:13.140]  So I would encourage listeners, yes, go get high quality, swirable foods. We have the only company, the biggest in the nation that actually still has food.
[1:29:13.140 --> 1:29:16.140]  It does take five to eight weeks to get it to you because they got a package that they got the food.
[1:29:16.140 --> 1:29:24.140]  But I would encourage listeners to do the most important thing and that's drink purified water, that's pray, that's get focused, that's not be stressed out because you're prepared.
[1:29:24.140 --> 1:29:31.140]  And that's get DNA Force Plus, the PQQ and CoQ10 that cleans out the mitochondria and the cells and is the biggest immune booster you can engage in.
[1:29:31.140 --> 1:29:39.140]  The X2, the X3, the foundation, everything, the Ultra 12 back in stock, our nano silver, super silver and super blue toothpaste, it's still 50% off.
[1:29:39.140 --> 1:29:46.140]  Turmeric is known for doing a super job when it comes to cleaning out your cells. We have the strongest turmeric you're going to find out there.
[1:29:46.140 --> 1:29:56.140]  95% of humanoid from bodies, ultimate turmeric formula, that's back in stock and purchases at m4store.com, the highest quality supplement, swirable food and you actually get them delivered in stock at m4store.com.

[1:30:08.140 --> 1:30:19.140]  Vitamin mineral fusion is high quality vitamins, minerals, amino acids and other key co factors that are so good for you and your family, especially your children's bodies and your immune systems.
[1:30:19.140 --> 1:30:35.140]  Ultra 12 is the highest quality vitamin B12 taken sublingually under the tongue. It is back in stock. You can get them both individually for 40% off right now and get them together as a combo for 50% off.
[1:30:35.140 --> 1:30:43.140]  This makes your life so much better when you have a good multivitamin mineral that you actually absorb and as a tasty fruit punch.
[1:30:43.140 --> 1:30:51.140]  And of course, vitamin B12 is the bedrock foundation of energy, stamina, libido, just everything.
[1:30:51.140 --> 1:31:17.140]  And they're both back in stock 40% off individually or 50% off when you get them together at m4store.com.
[1:31:21.140 --> 1:31:41.140]  Thank you so much for watching this video.
[1:31:41.140 --> 1:31:58.140]  It's brilliant. You've taken the very element that they try to repress you with that silence and made it into a weapon. You have the loudest sound of all, silence. And you know what's most disturbing to people? Silence.
[1:31:58.140 --> 1:32:17.140]  I spend a lot of time reminding the M4s, the family of listeners and viewers that without you, we won't be on the air. And I spend a lot of time thanking you. But I really think you should thank yourself for keeping us on the air and really changing the world for the better and raising the alarm as modern ball reviewers.
[1:32:17.140 --> 1:32:29.140]  Something I should spend more time on is just reminding you that these products are really amazing. You've got that pledge from me, but you've seen the third-party test out there, the air filtration, the water filtration.
[1:32:29.140 --> 1:32:53.140]  The supplements are all the very best you're going to find out there. And you can't fund an operation anywhere else that's fighting the globalist this hard. So it's not a burden to support InfoWars. It really is something that is good for everybody that stands for justice and freedom and makes your life and your family's life and your children's life so much better.
[1:32:53.140 --> 1:33:01.140]  So visit InfoWarsStore.com today.
[1:33:01.140 --> 1:33:15.140]  You're listening to the Alex Jones show.
[1:33:15.140 --> 1:33:25.140]  We've got police and firefighters and military and everybody calling in. So I'm going to shut up now and go to your calls. Alex Jones here back live on this live Sunday show.
[1:33:25.140 --> 1:33:33.140]  Don't forget the weekly shows come up tomorrow. 11 a.m. Central. David Knight comes home before me. The David Knight show. It's excellent, very informative. 8 a.m. Central. InfoWars.com.
[1:33:33.140 --> 1:33:49.140]  Thanks for calling. Go ahead, sir.
[1:33:49.140 --> 1:34:05.140]  This is going to really mess up the economy.
[1:34:05.140 --> 1:34:21.140]  You know, I've had a saying right now is the interest payments don't stop because of a virus. There's no vaccine for that. So when people aren't showing up at restaurants and people aren't going to work, interest is still going ahead.
[1:34:21.140 --> 1:34:27.140]  And as you know, this is the world record in the history of man for debt.
[1:34:27.140 --> 1:34:39.140]  No, you're right. A lot of smart folks are saying this is a globalist reset. So they say face on imploding the economy and then re monetizing everything. What do you think?
[1:34:39.140 --> 1:34:49.140]  I think exactly that. I think that we are as humanity is not up for another war. So they did something that's a little more palatable of a virus.
[1:34:49.140 --> 1:34:59.140]  I was going to say that at the start of the show today and you just said it while the college is so great. Instead of having a big war like we normally have, they're just giving us this virus. What else do you think is coming, Craig?
[1:34:59.140 --> 1:35:13.140]  You know, so we've got the reset, which is going to cause fear and fear is there. That's their club that they use to beat us down. And I'd like to give you Zeus's thunderbolt on the other side.
[1:35:13.140 --> 1:35:19.140]  Cause right now, and I've thought about this even before the virus, just that, uh, so they're going to, they're going to hit.
[1:35:19.140 --> 1:35:23.140]  Oh, I said two months ago, I bet when they don't get him in peace, they launch a bio up and I'm on record.
[1:35:23.140 --> 1:35:27.140]  Yeah. Yeah. No, no, no. Yeah. But I just mean, uh, in terms of this economic.
[1:35:27.140 --> 1:35:39.140]  No, no, no, you're right too. The colors are smarter than I am. It's incredible. How just the people know the people understand that the philosophers all knew that when I say, Oh, you're right. I'm just agreeing with you.
[1:35:39.140 --> 1:35:46.140]  Yeah. I mean, this reset has to happen. Uh, virus or no virus. This is just speeded it up and probably made it worse.
[1:35:46.140 --> 1:35:54.140]  It's 100% a cover for China losing the trade war. It's their reset. The globalist made behind the scenes deals that they then intend to blame on Trump.
[1:35:54.140 --> 1:35:56.140]  Do you agree with that?
[1:35:56.140 --> 1:35:57.140]  I totally agree with that.
[1:35:57.140 --> 1:36:00.140]  And then how does Trump counter that? How does Trump counter that, Craig?
[1:36:00.140 --> 1:36:10.140]  So when that happens and people's pensions are getting whacked and people are out of jobs and their fear, the one thing is you haven't had Catherine Austin fits on for a long time.
[1:36:10.140 --> 1:36:13.140]  Please get around this week and tell the producers get it, get fits on immediately.
[1:36:13.140 --> 1:36:20.140]  Because have you heard about the 21 trillion dollars that's been verified?
[1:36:20.140 --> 1:36:27.140]  So, so she, she is working with a professor at Michigan state. They went through the books and I think it's just the DOD.
[1:36:27.140 --> 1:36:30.140]  Yeah, the Pentagon missing money. Yeah.
[1:36:30.140 --> 1:36:37.140]  Yeah. No, no, but she, she has taken a Michigan state professor, took a hold that the whole economic department went through this.
[1:36:37.140 --> 1:36:42.140]  Just that one department, 21 trillion missing dollars.
[1:36:42.140 --> 1:36:48.140]  No, I know it's been, it's been incredible. Thank you so much. So you talked to that caller for 10 hours. Thank you, Craig.
[1:36:48.140 --> 1:36:53.140]  Okay. Who's up next? Wesley, Wesley in Georgia. Thanks for holding. Go ahead.
[1:36:53.140 --> 1:36:55.140]  Hey, Alex has a good one.
[1:36:55.140 --> 1:36:59.140]  I've been rocking my brain because I just gut level. I really feel concerned.
[1:36:59.140 --> 1:37:05.140]  Well, listen, Alex, I'm a firefighter in Georgia in the heart of a community of about 60,000.
[1:37:05.140 --> 1:37:08.140]  God bless you, brother. Thank you for your service to America.
[1:37:08.140 --> 1:37:15.140]  Well, thank you, Alex. And the other day, the chief comes to me, we've been friends for years and he says, I just found out something.
[1:37:15.140 --> 1:37:22.140]  And here's the, here's the city's credit card and told me to order $2,000 worth of medical supplies.
[1:37:22.140 --> 1:37:28.140]  And him and I, we don't hold secrets and he would not tell me what he found out, Alex. So something's going on.
[1:37:28.140 --> 1:37:30.140]  Well, that's because he was ordered to not tell you.
[1:37:30.140 --> 1:37:34.140]  That's right. The second point, Alex, I'll be real quick. I know you got to change.
[1:37:34.140 --> 1:37:41.140]  No, no, we want to hear from you. Let me tell you where the rubber meets the row with firefighters and police officers and medics.
[1:37:41.140 --> 1:37:44.140]  That's where you really find out what's going on. So tell us what you know.
[1:37:44.140 --> 1:37:48.140]  Well, you know, Alex, you've been wanting to know, you know, who really started this.
[1:37:48.140 --> 1:37:53.140]  And I think the answer to that question is you have to find out who stands to gain something.
[1:37:53.140 --> 1:37:54.140]  Exactly.
[1:37:54.140 --> 1:38:01.140]  So when, so when the FEMA quarantine camps are going on, who stands to gain something, it's Amazon that delivers all the food with a drone.
[1:38:01.140 --> 1:38:03.140]  Okay. When Congress.
[1:38:03.140 --> 1:38:07.140]  Oh, just like China. Oh, you just, oh my God, that's why I love the colors.
[1:38:07.140 --> 1:38:09.140]  I'm telling you, Alex.
[1:38:09.140 --> 1:38:12.140]  They were doing massive drone tests the last six months at night.
[1:38:12.140 --> 1:38:18.140]  It was Amazon doing it. Oh, they've been just like drones are controlling everything in China.
[1:38:18.140 --> 1:38:19.140]  Oh my gosh.
[1:38:19.140 --> 1:38:21.140]  It's going to get better, Alex.
[1:38:21.140 --> 1:38:24.140]  Start over. No, you've got the floor. I'm going to shut up. Go ahead.
[1:38:24.140 --> 1:38:29.140]  So when Congress and the government is operating off a telecom, who stands to gain?
[1:38:29.140 --> 1:38:31.140]  Okay. Now that's Facebook and Microsoft.
[1:38:31.140 --> 1:38:35.140]  Whenever things on the one drive cloud.
[1:38:35.140 --> 1:38:37.140]  No, you said it. The Pentagon's going over to their control.
[1:38:37.140 --> 1:38:40.140]  This is and it's big tech ordering the panic.
[1:38:40.140 --> 1:38:42.140]  This is their takeover right now.
[1:38:42.140 --> 1:38:44.140]  So they already took our speech and they surveil us.
[1:38:44.140 --> 1:38:45.140]  Now they're teaching us.
[1:38:45.140 --> 1:38:48.140]  They tell us to stay in our houses and now they watch us.
[1:38:48.140 --> 1:38:54.140]  And see, this is just all part of a series of plan because, you know, people for, you know,
[1:38:54.140 --> 1:38:57.140]  what a 12 gauge shotgun would do with like number six, number six.
[1:38:57.140 --> 1:38:58.140]  You don't hurt buildings behind it.
[1:38:58.140 --> 1:39:00.140]  Well, don't use double.
[1:39:00.140 --> 1:39:02.140]  She's like number six or seven.
[1:39:02.140 --> 1:39:05.140]  Those drones, I'm not, those drones are going down.
[1:39:05.140 --> 1:39:08.140]  He talked about some bird hunting, boy.
[1:39:08.140 --> 1:39:12.140]  And people, you know, I don't know if you remember two years ago, the black guys,
[1:39:12.140 --> 1:39:14.140]  they got kicked out of face out of Starbucks.
[1:39:14.140 --> 1:39:16.140]  That was just a ruse, Alex.
[1:39:16.140 --> 1:39:18.140]  And so it's little subtle things.
[1:39:18.140 --> 1:39:19.140]  Oh, no, it came out.
[1:39:19.140 --> 1:39:23.140]  They did that before the owner that would ask every white person why they were a racist.
[1:39:23.140 --> 1:39:28.140]  It's just, you're exactly, man, you're, what's coming next?
[1:39:28.140 --> 1:39:32.140]  Well, you know, I mean, there's, there's all kinds of things out that you can think of.
[1:39:32.140 --> 1:39:35.140]  And it starts with little subtle things like this.
[1:39:35.140 --> 1:39:40.140]  And David Knight said at best, you know, Hey, whoa, whoa, what are you doing trying to get on this airplane?
[1:39:40.140 --> 1:39:42.140]  You don't have a vaccination certificate.
[1:39:42.140 --> 1:39:48.140]  And so it's, it's those little subtle things that they try to make Americans itself.
[1:39:48.140 --> 1:39:51.140]  And just, you know, we say, okay, you know, whatever.
[1:39:51.140 --> 1:39:54.140]  And before long, it's just like China.
[1:39:54.140 --> 1:39:59.140]  And we're not accepting the social China brags that they've got the cell phones tracking where you go, what you do.
[1:39:59.140 --> 1:40:02.140]  And if you haven't done what they say, they turn it off during the emergency.
[1:40:02.140 --> 1:40:05.140]  This is a global government. Now they've got an Air Force where you go.
[1:40:05.140 --> 1:40:08.140]  You scan your face instead of showing your passport in Americans.
[1:40:08.140 --> 1:40:09.140]  They just line up.
[1:40:09.140 --> 1:40:14.140]  They actually pay for the service.
[1:40:14.140 --> 1:40:18.140]  And the kids are all trained on their iPhones to get on the phone via that.
[1:40:18.140 --> 1:40:19.140]  No, it's all training.
[1:40:19.140 --> 1:40:21.140]  It's all synthetic Wesley.
[1:40:21.140 --> 1:40:22.140]  Get Wesley's name and numbers.
[1:40:22.140 --> 1:40:23.140]  We're starting that show soon.
[1:40:23.140 --> 1:40:27.140]  It's going to happen where the callers of the host get his name and number, put it in the hopper.
[1:40:27.140 --> 1:40:30.140]  Please guys, don't, don't forget.
[1:40:30.140 --> 1:40:31.140]  Wow.
[1:40:31.140 --> 1:40:32.140]  Yeah.
[1:40:32.140 --> 1:40:36.140]  How facial recognition is taken over airports, but we got to let the jotties in.
[1:40:36.140 --> 1:40:37.140]  Wow.
[1:40:37.140 --> 1:40:38.140]  All right, Wesley.
[1:40:38.140 --> 1:40:39.140]  Thank you.
[1:40:39.140 --> 1:40:41.140]  Let's go ahead and take another call.
[1:40:41.140 --> 1:40:43.140]  Lisa in California.
[1:40:43.140 --> 1:40:45.140]  Lisa, that was a scary caller.
[1:40:45.140 --> 1:40:46.140]  He was dead on.
[1:40:46.140 --> 1:40:47.140]  What do you have to say?
[1:40:47.140 --> 1:40:48.140]  Hi, Alex.
[1:40:48.140 --> 1:40:49.140]  Okay.
[1:40:49.140 --> 1:40:53.140]  So I totally, I mean, the hype is crazy.
[1:40:53.140 --> 1:40:55.140]  It's everywhere.
[1:40:55.140 --> 1:41:05.140]  But, you know, you have been promoting like preparedness and get your, you know, storeable
[1:41:05.140 --> 1:41:06.140]  foods and that's great.
[1:41:06.140 --> 1:41:15.140]  But you have not been, you haven't been promoting your supplements.
[1:41:15.140 --> 1:41:20.140]  And I think I have just about everything except for turbo force for, you know, for our family.
[1:41:20.140 --> 1:41:21.140]  And it works.
[1:41:21.140 --> 1:41:24.140]  You have to have, you have to build your immune system.
[1:41:24.140 --> 1:41:27.140]  Otherwise, you're going to end up in the hospital.
[1:41:27.140 --> 1:41:30.140]  And what good is your food going to, your storeable food going to do you?
[1:41:30.140 --> 1:41:34.140]  Well, that's the thing is, you know, I get calls from people go, man, I thought this
[1:41:34.140 --> 1:41:35.140]  was hype.
[1:41:35.140 --> 1:41:36.140]  I use it.
[1:41:36.140 --> 1:41:37.140]  It's great.
[1:41:37.140 --> 1:41:39.940]  These are the very best supplements, whether it's DNA force plus X2X3 turbo force is not
[1:41:39.940 --> 1:41:40.940]  for your immunity.
[1:41:40.940 --> 1:41:44.340]  It's for energy, 10 hour energy, probably lowers your immunity, even though it's five of
[1:41:44.340 --> 1:41:45.340]  its minerals.
[1:41:45.340 --> 1:41:46.340]  And let's not lie.
[1:41:46.340 --> 1:41:49.140]  That stuff jacking yourself up overall is probably not good, but people use it.
[1:41:49.140 --> 1:41:50.140]  I use it.
[1:41:50.140 --> 1:41:51.140]  That's not bad for you.
[1:41:51.140 --> 1:41:52.140]  I'm just being honest.
[1:41:52.140 --> 1:41:58.140]  It's not bad for your immunity, but absolutely the fish oil, the D3, the, the, the old, the
[1:41:58.140 --> 1:42:00.140]  ultra 12, it's all back in stock.
[1:42:00.140 --> 1:42:01.140]  You're absolutely right.
[1:42:01.140 --> 1:42:04.140]  It's what funds the operation and they are great products.
[1:42:04.140 --> 1:42:05.140]  Right.
[1:42:05.140 --> 1:42:11.140]  And, you know, I just want to say, um, you should have, um, Sheva Ira DeRay on your program
[1:42:11.140 --> 1:42:16.140]  because he talks about building the system, your, your immune system.
[1:42:16.140 --> 1:42:20.140]  Because you need to, but you need to build that and you're every single one of your products
[1:42:20.140 --> 1:42:24.140]  will build your immune system and then working together all, you know, in synergy.
[1:42:24.140 --> 1:42:26.140]  I'm out of time, Lisa, but God bless you.
[1:42:26.140 --> 1:42:31.140]  Let me just say this because Mike Adams told me two weeks ago, he goes, Hey, you keep saying
[1:42:31.140 --> 1:42:34.140]  food is six to eight weeks now.
[1:42:34.140 --> 1:42:36.140]  People think that's your supplements.
[1:42:36.140 --> 1:42:38.140]  I drop ship the food.
[1:42:38.140 --> 1:42:39.140]  Nobody else has the food.
[1:42:39.140 --> 1:42:40.140]  We have the best company.
[1:42:40.140 --> 1:42:41.140]  You actually get it.
[1:42:41.140 --> 1:42:42.140]  We're not going to lie.
[1:42:42.140 --> 1:42:44.140]  Six to eight weeks, more like four to five weeks, 68.
[1:42:44.140 --> 1:42:47.140]  We have the, we have the, we have the technology.
[1:42:47.140 --> 1:42:48.140]  We have the supplements.
[1:42:48.140 --> 1:42:50.140]  You order them.
[1:42:50.140 --> 1:42:52.140]  Unless it's on a Friday, they ship the next day.
[1:42:52.140 --> 1:42:57.140]  Our warehouse is next day shipping in former store.
[1:42:57.140 --> 1:42:59.140]  The evidence is overwhelming.
[1:42:59.140 --> 1:43:06.140]  Coronavirus is a man made by a weapon designed to destroy nation states, economies and free
[1:43:06.140 --> 1:43:09.140]  peoples and usher in a planetary government.
[1:43:09.140 --> 1:43:12.140]  This is how the globalists are striking back.
[1:43:12.140 --> 1:43:14.140]  Here's a fortune headline today.
[1:43:14.140 --> 1:43:21.140]  Fears of global coronavirus contagion rage as 3000 cruise ship passengers return home.
[1:43:21.140 --> 1:43:23.140]  And that's just in one nation.
[1:43:23.140 --> 1:43:28.140]  Coronavirus deals major blow to German car factories in China.
[1:43:28.140 --> 1:43:33.140]  The reporting it could cut their sales in half this year.
[1:43:33.140 --> 1:43:36.140]  That's how major this is.
[1:43:36.140 --> 1:43:38.140]  Everyone needs to be prepared.
[1:43:38.140 --> 1:43:42.140]  2020 is not a year to play games.
[1:43:42.140 --> 1:43:47.140]  The info wars will continue to report the latest information as it comes out.
[1:43:47.140 --> 1:43:51.140]  Regardless of the fact of the establishment, we'll try to punish us for telling the truth.

[1:45:01.140 --> 1:45:03.140]  A lot of people that never deliver.
