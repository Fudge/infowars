[00:00.000 --> 00:04.080]  Mortgage Giants Freddie May and Freddie Mac. The Bush administration took the
[00:04.080 --> 00:08.440]  action to avoid the possibility of major financial turmoil. Treasury Secretary
[00:08.440 --> 00:13.200]  Henry Paulson. I attribute the need for today's action primarily to the inherent
[00:13.200 --> 00:18.440]  conflict and flawed business model embedded in the GSE structure and to the
[00:18.440 --> 00:22.480]  ongoing housing correction. The top executives of both institutions got
[00:22.480 --> 00:26.400]  the acts. They've been replaced by Herb Allison, the former vice chairman of
[00:26.400 --> 00:30.920]  Merrill Lynch. He will head Freddie May and David Moffat, former vice chairman of
[00:30.920 --> 00:35.720]  U.S. Bank Corp, was chosen to head Freddie Mac. Powerful and deadly hurricane
[00:35.720 --> 00:39.280]  Ike is barreling toward the Gulf of Mexico. Forecasters say the category
[00:39.280 --> 00:43.680]  four storm could intensify before it moves into Cuba late today. The United
[00:43.680 --> 00:47.200]  States oil companies with installations in the Gulf of Mexico are keeping a
[00:47.200 --> 00:51.720]  wary eye out for Ike. This is the information radio network.
[00:51.720 --> 00:56.640]  Suriasis, the itching, flaking and irritation is painful but the emotional
[00:56.640 --> 01:00.720]  suffering can be even more devastating. My body was so sore my mind was so worn
[01:00.720 --> 01:04.160]  out I could not sleep at night. I felt self-conscious nobody knows what that
[01:04.160 --> 01:07.760]  flaking is. And people say ew it just made me feel like you're dirty. A lot of people
[01:07.760 --> 01:10.640]  know when I have this to bear a thing. Of course I felt self-conscious not very
[01:10.640 --> 01:14.840]  attractive to look at. The solution is new and improves Kinzink advanced the

[01:55.640 --> 01:59.600]  McCain's pick for a running mate, Governor Sarah Palin, is a skilled
[01:59.600 --> 02:03.760]  politician. However he told ABC's this week he thinks McCain chose a vice
[02:03.760 --> 02:07.800]  presidential nominee who's even more closely aligned to President Bush than
[02:07.800 --> 02:11.960]  McCain himself. Obama also challenged claims about the McCain campaign that
[02:11.960 --> 02:15.680]  Palin has more national security experience than he does due to Alaska's
[02:15.680 --> 02:20.320]  proximity to Russia and her command of the Alaska National Guard. The United
[02:20.320 --> 02:23.960]  States forces in Iraq will be getting a new leader. General David Petraeus will
[02:23.960 --> 02:27.560]  hand over command of those forces to Lieutenant General Raymond Odenaro
[02:27.560 --> 02:32.760]  later this month. There are approximately 146,000 US troops in Iraq. Petraeus has
[02:32.760 --> 02:37.120]  commanded them for just over a year and a half. Odenaro will be promoted to full
[02:37.120 --> 02:42.080]  general as he takes over command. Petraeus is one of the military's most highly
[02:42.080 --> 02:47.120]  regarded figures. The transfer is to take place September 16th for the latest

[03:22.000 --> 03:26.960]  Vice President Cheney is continuing his diplomacy over the crisis in Georgia.
[03:26.960 --> 03:31.040]  He's been visiting Italy, but a foreign minister says Cheney renewed his call for
[03:31.040 --> 03:34.840]  cooperation between Europe and the United States on Georgia. Cheney wants
[03:34.840 --> 03:38.280]  Western nations to keep Russia from using his position as an energy supplier
[03:38.280 --> 03:42.480]  to intimidate its neighbors. In Islamabad, tests are being conducted on a powder
[03:42.480 --> 03:46.880]  that was sent in envelopes to two American diplomatic outposts in Pakistan.
[03:46.880 --> 03:51.480]  A U.S. embassy spokesman says a very small number of people had contact with
[03:51.480 --> 03:54.920]  the envelopes and that nobody is showing any signs of illness. From Kandahar,
[03:54.920 --> 03:58.680]  Afghan police say two blasts have gone off at a police headquarters in Kandahar
[03:58.680 --> 04:02.960]  and casualties are feared. One officer says a suicide bomber targeted a police
[04:02.960 --> 04:06.600]  commander in the former Taliban stronghold. For the first time, Israel's
[04:06.600 --> 04:10.920]  government is talking about paying Jewish settlers to leave their homes in the
[04:10.920 --> 04:14.400]  West Bank, even before a peace deal is signed with the Palestinians.
[04:14.400 --> 04:19.200]  Prime Minister Ehud Omert says a peace agreement would require evacuating
[04:19.200 --> 04:22.720]  settlers and the country needs to be thinking about these issues. Having a
[04:22.720 --> 04:27.000]  machinery still hasn't become the task of lifting huge slabs of rock from atop
[04:27.000 --> 04:31.000]  the homes of an Egyptian shanty town where at least 31 people are dead and
[04:31.000 --> 04:35.160]  many more may be buried. Residents and journalists have been moved away from
[04:35.160 --> 04:39.080]  the site and it fears that more rocks could break off the cliffs nearby.
[04:39.080 --> 04:43.440]  And Canada's Prime Minister is hoping to strengthen the governing position of his
[04:43.440 --> 04:47.680]  conservative minority government. Stephen Harper has dissolved Canada's
[04:47.680 --> 04:52.400]  Parliament. I'm Pete LaValle, IRNUSA Radio News.

[06:30.160 --> 06:37.160]  Now live from Austin, Texas. Here's Alex Jones.
[06:37.160 --> 06:41.160]  Welcome and thank you for joining us on this Sunday evening across the country
[06:41.160 --> 06:49.160]  and around the planet. It is the 7th day of September 2008 on this Sunday edition.
[06:49.160 --> 06:57.160]  I have a lot of important news and information to cover. Also going to be opening the phones up throughout the broadcast today to take your calls.
[06:57.160 --> 07:04.160]  Toll-free, 877-590-5525. 877-590-5525.
[07:04.160 --> 07:09.160]  You're listening to us in central Texas from the station that this syndicated program originates from.
[07:09.160 --> 07:16.160]  News radio, 590-KLBJ. You can call us at 836-0590 on the local number.
[07:16.160 --> 07:21.160]  I didn't take a lot of calls last week because we had several important guests on.
[07:21.160 --> 07:28.160]  This week we'll have more time to take your calls on a whole plethora of important issues.
[07:28.160 --> 07:32.160]  Before I get started, let me just put it to you this way.
[07:32.160 --> 07:44.160]  95% of what I discuss on this show is un-debated. It is incontrovertible facts.
[07:44.160 --> 07:55.160]  Council on Foreign Relations is trying to overthrow the United States and set up a global corporate government out of its ashes.
[07:55.160 --> 08:08.160]  Henry Kissinger is a big New Brzezinski. All these top globalist planners, David Rockefeller, all write books admitting their engineering all of this.
[08:08.160 --> 08:18.160]  But then they conversely on the news talk to the public like their children and say none of that exists, go back to sleep.
[08:18.160 --> 08:28.160]  The federal government along with some other governments and international government admits that since the mid-90s they have been sprang by adding chemicals to jet fuel.
[08:28.160 --> 08:32.160]  So the pilots and airline companies aren't even involved.
[08:32.160 --> 08:36.160]  They're just told, you know, here's the fuel.
[08:36.160 --> 08:41.160]  They're just sprang poisonous particulates into the sky called chemtrails.
[08:41.160 --> 08:47.160]  And this is all admitted in government documents. It's going on.
[08:47.160 --> 08:52.160]  But before they launched that program, they preconditioned people in the media that crazy folks talked about it.
[08:52.160 --> 09:00.160]  So I thought people were crazy talking about it until I saw the government documents.
[09:00.160 --> 09:19.160]  And what I'm trying to make here is that we have the national security state absorbing our country and absorbing other nations like a boa constrictor gobbling up a piglet or a baboon or a baby alligator.
[09:19.160 --> 09:26.160]  Whatever boa constrictors eat, the point is you've got the image of baby hippo. Ever seen that video on YouTube?
[09:26.160 --> 09:33.160]  The panic 400 pound baby hippo and the huge snake is eating it? Amazing.
[09:33.160 --> 09:38.160]  The point is that we don't have a new world order.
[09:38.160 --> 09:45.160]  We don't have a global government. We don't have a national security state, but we almost do.
[09:45.160 --> 09:50.160]  And they say that in David Rockefeller's autobiography four years ago.
[09:50.160 --> 09:57.160]  And you can go watch on Charlie Rose YouTube channel hundreds of globalists.
[09:57.160 --> 10:02.160]  Henry Kissinger, you name it, Rothschild's Rockefellers come on and say we've got our global government.
[10:02.160 --> 10:07.160]  It's almost in place. So it's kind of like a house. They built the foundation.
[10:07.160 --> 10:13.160]  They put in the skeleton of the building. They put sheet rock on it. They put in plumbing.
[10:13.160 --> 10:20.160]  They're putting in the carpet now, the paint, the chandeliers. They're putting in the electrical outlets.
[10:20.160 --> 10:26.160]  I mean, it's almost done. They're open in the doors next week, folks. They're going to have an open house,
[10:26.160 --> 10:28.160]  but they're not going to be offering brownies and cookies.
[10:28.160 --> 10:36.160]  But no, they're going to be offering forced inoculations with cancer viruses, and they say they are.
[10:36.160 --> 10:43.160]  And to know this, and to know this is being constructed, and to know this is being built,
[10:43.160 --> 10:49.160]  and to know the United States and England are the furthest along, and to see what they're doing.
[10:49.160 --> 10:54.160]  I mean, doubling and then tripling the police in the last 10 years.
[10:54.160 --> 11:02.160]  The CIA recruiting in high schools, colleges, everywhere, doubling and quadrupling again for domestic operations.
[11:02.160 --> 11:06.160]  I mean, it isn't enough to ship in all the heroin and cocaine.
[11:06.160 --> 11:10.160]  I mean, your war on drugs is going after your competition.
[11:10.160 --> 11:20.160]  All the hundreds of flights that have crashed or local cops will bust a whole 18-wheeler and full of cocaine.
[11:20.160 --> 11:24.160]  They'll be told, hey, national security.
[11:24.160 --> 11:29.160]  And then these good old boys, these old senators and bankers that run our country,
[11:29.160 --> 11:32.160]  it isn't enough to sell heroin and cocaine to our kids.
[11:32.160 --> 11:37.160]  But no, you've got to put them in prison for using your products.
[11:37.160 --> 11:43.160]  And you've got to kick down the wrong doors every day looking for your products, and you're like, well, Alex,
[11:43.160 --> 11:46.160]  we've got to have it be illegal because that's what keeps the price up.
[11:46.160 --> 11:48.160]  That's what makes there be a black market.
[11:48.160 --> 11:58.160]  It'd be like 100 years ago, 80 years ago, when heroin and cocaine were stole on store shelves at every drug store.
[11:58.160 --> 12:02.160]  When it was in Coca-Cola, soda pop.
[12:02.160 --> 12:05.160]  And Alex, we own the prisons.
[12:05.160 --> 12:12.160]  That's right, the drug dealers own the prisons, the private prisons that they put you in when you're caught using their product.
[12:12.160 --> 12:16.160]  It's an economic model that's really hard to believe.
[12:16.160 --> 12:22.160]  These guys are masters of building total slave grids.
[12:22.160 --> 12:27.160]  You know, I wasn't even looking for the news of government drug dealing today.
[12:27.160 --> 12:34.160]  But I ran across two different stories, just mainstream stories about government drug dealing.
[12:34.160 --> 12:39.160]  One was out of Reuters.
[12:39.160 --> 12:46.160]  It's just been confirmed by the U.S. government that it was a CIA rendition aircraft for grabbing people they kidnapped
[12:46.160 --> 12:52.160]  and flying them to Gitmo and other black sites in Europe, not just in the Caribbean coast sites.
[12:52.160 --> 12:59.160]  But that it crashed with 3.3 tons of pure cocaine. It was coming from the source out of Columbia
[12:59.160 --> 13:05.160]  when the CIA aircraft went into a storm and had some type of problems landing and crashed.
[13:05.160 --> 13:07.160]  And there have been hundreds of those.
[13:07.160 --> 13:12.160]  There have been CIA aircraft crashing Miami and cocaine and heroin just all over the field.
[13:12.160 --> 13:15.160]  And the guys in black, the men in black show up.
[13:15.160 --> 13:22.160]  So I want to tell young people, the only way to beat these bastards is to keep your mouth shut in school, keep your head down.
[13:22.160 --> 13:25.160]  The public schools are induction centers to induct you into prison.
[13:25.160 --> 13:31.160]  The state code in Texas says that three truancies is not a truancy.
[13:31.160 --> 13:36.160]  It's more than 10, but they'll still criminally charge you for truancies that don't exist.
[13:36.160 --> 13:40.160]  They count being late to classes truancies and charge you.
[13:40.160 --> 13:45.160]  The courts are frauds, the systems fraud. It's all criminal. And the government has heard you.
[13:45.160 --> 13:49.160]  The government knows you're mad, knows that you understand their illegitimate
[13:49.160 --> 13:56.160]  and is gearing up a police state because they're aware of the fact that we are waking up to their criminality.
[13:56.160 --> 13:58.160]  People always say, why doesn't the government hear us?
[13:58.160 --> 14:00.160]  Why does the government ignore the Constitution?
[14:00.160 --> 14:04.160]  And, you know, on every issue, what the people want is popular and constitutional.
[14:04.160 --> 14:11.160]  You know, all the polls, 80, 90 percent, the people that are against open borders, against the war, against the big brother,
[14:11.160 --> 14:17.160]  against the cameras, against the biometrics, against more cops, and they just say, hey, you don't run anything.
[14:17.160 --> 14:24.160]  The national security state does, based in Cheyenne Mountain, Colorado,
[14:24.160 --> 14:29.160]  in Colorado Springs, and we work for the big private banks, and we are going to push Ritalin and Prozac,
[14:29.160 --> 14:33.160]  whose molecules are more dangerous than the illegal drugs we push on you.
[14:33.160 --> 14:36.160]  And we're going to build more camps, and we're going to build more prisons,
[14:36.160 --> 14:40.160]  and we're going to train your children to tattle and spy on the parents inside the schools.
[14:40.160 --> 14:44.160]  And we're going to fully destroy the Bill of Rights and Constitution,
[14:44.160 --> 14:49.160]  and we're going to have global carbon tax and the new environmental footprint garbage,
[14:49.160 --> 14:56.160]  with this terra pass baloney, where every facet of your life is going to be regulated, tracked, and controlled.
[14:56.160 --> 15:00.160]  And if you don't like it, we'll soon buy some hardcore killers in black uniforms
[15:00.160 --> 15:05.160]  that will shove a gun down your throat and blow your brains all over the wall.
[15:05.160 --> 15:11.160]  Because they like steroids, they like power, they like being macho, and they're too cowardly to go fight real enemies.
[15:11.160 --> 15:13.160]  You understand? They're coming for you.
[15:13.160 --> 15:19.160]  And a lot of them aren't cowardly. They've been running Abu Ghraib torture camps, and they're coming here now.
[15:19.160 --> 15:23.160]  Now, that's America. That's what America is.
[15:23.160 --> 15:28.160]  Now, you can wake up now, we can turn it around, maybe, or you can still keep living in denial.
[15:28.160 --> 15:36.160]  You can still keep believing in Sarah Palin or all these other idiots like Barack Obama
[15:36.160 --> 15:38.160]  that are total puppets and run nothing.
[15:38.160 --> 15:44.160]  Or you can grow up and stop being little children and admit bad people took over and weren't a lot of trouble.
[15:44.160 --> 16:09.160]  And we're going to have to fight for our lives just to survive.
[16:09.160 --> 16:17.160]  On June 4, 1963, an unknown presidential decree, Executive Order 11110 was signed with the authority to strip
[16:17.160 --> 16:21.160]  the Federal Reserve Bank of its power to lend money to the United States government in interest.
[16:21.160 --> 16:25.160]  With the stroke of a pen, Kennedy would have put the Fed out of business.
[16:25.160 --> 16:28.160]  The November assassination quieted the production of the new currency.
[16:28.160 --> 16:31.160]  However, the executive order still stands unrepealed.
[16:31.160 --> 16:39.160]  Minus has the Kennedy v. Fed document. Call 800-686-2237. Unlike your liberty, the paper is free.
[16:39.160 --> 16:48.160]  Call 800-686-2237. If you're interested in breaking the bondage of taxation and debt, call 800-686-2237.

[17:09.160 --> 17:14.160]  In fact, clinically-detected parasites account for only 1% of all cases.
[17:14.160 --> 17:17.160]  Don't continue to suffer from pain due to misdiagnosis.

[20:05.160 --> 20:09.160]  Let me just give you one microscopic zoom in.
[20:09.160 --> 20:17.160]  Imagine you're staring at a whole world of government covert operations, corruption, evil.
[20:17.160 --> 20:20.160]  And then zoom in on one little area.
[20:20.160 --> 20:23.160]  What's the CIA doing in America?
[20:23.160 --> 20:26.160]  Of course, that's totally illegal, but they now admit they're everywhere.
[20:26.160 --> 20:30.160]  What have they been doing since the mid-80s that we can confirm?
[20:30.160 --> 20:39.160]  And I mean, this is with Marine Corps captains, police chiefs, governors, that I personally have interviewed.
[20:39.160 --> 20:41.160]  You want their names?
[20:41.160 --> 20:43.160]  Well, I can't tell you the Marine Corps captain's name.
[20:43.160 --> 20:46.160]  We blur his face out, but I can tell you Governor Jesse Ventura.
[20:46.160 --> 20:51.160]  I can tell you former San Antonio police chief, Allie Philippus.
[20:51.160 --> 20:56.160]  I can tell you Jack D. Compton, police chief of Alice, Texas.
[20:56.160 --> 20:58.160]  You want more names?
[20:58.160 --> 21:07.160]  The CIA comes to them with giant bags of $100 bills and says,
[21:07.160 --> 21:12.160]  we just want you to be friends with the government.
[21:12.160 --> 21:15.160]  Now, these are interviews I have conducted that have been on air.
[21:15.160 --> 21:18.160]  You know, years later you hear about it on NPR, the Washington Post.
[21:18.160 --> 21:21.160]  That's all been mainstream news in the case of Ventura.
[21:21.160 --> 21:25.160]  He shows up his first day at work and there's 23 CIA people there and they go,
[21:25.160 --> 21:29.160]  explain something, we basically run things trying to kind of intimidate him and threaten him.
[21:29.160 --> 21:31.160]  He just said, who are you?
[21:31.160 --> 21:32.160]  We're not going to tell you.
[21:32.160 --> 21:33.160]  We talk to you, you don't talk to us.
[21:33.160 --> 21:36.160]  He said, get the hell out of my office.
[21:36.160 --> 21:39.160]  So we told him, get the hell out of here.
[21:39.160 --> 21:40.160]  This is America.
[21:40.160 --> 21:41.160]  I'm a governor.
[21:41.160 --> 21:43.160]  And they said, oh, that's how you want it.
[21:43.160 --> 21:46.160]  And they ran black ops in the news on him from there and on out.
[21:46.160 --> 21:48.160]  They went after his kids in the media, everything else.
[21:48.160 --> 21:50.160]  And they were little old ladies.
[21:50.160 --> 21:52.160]  They were young black guys.
[21:52.160 --> 21:53.160]  They were trendies.
[21:53.160 --> 21:55.160]  They were the guy next door.
[21:55.160 --> 21:58.160]  23 of them in his office telling a governor.
[21:58.160 --> 22:06.160]  Now, Ali Philippus, former army intelligence, Vietnam veteran, patriotic, police chief of San Antonio.
[22:06.160 --> 22:19.160]  Delta Force approaches him and basically that's militarized CIA commandos attached to the National Security Council.
[22:19.160 --> 22:23.160]  And they just were running all over San Antonio, all over Miami, all over Houston, all over East St. Louis.
[22:23.160 --> 22:25.160]  And I would interview the mayors, everybody.
[22:25.160 --> 22:27.160]  Of course, most of them ended up taking the cash.
[22:27.160 --> 22:31.160]  They'd show up and they'd say, here's $500,000 just to be our friend.
[22:31.160 --> 22:34.160]  Now, see, that's covert takeover of your governments.
[22:34.160 --> 22:36.160]  They do that in Georgia.
[22:36.160 --> 22:40.160]  And I mean Georgia over in the Caucasus, South Caucasus.
[22:40.160 --> 22:43.160]  They do that in Belarus.
[22:43.160 --> 22:45.160]  They do that in Pakistan.
[22:45.160 --> 22:46.160]  They do that in India.
[22:46.160 --> 22:48.160]  It's all completely illegal.
[22:48.160 --> 22:55.160]  See, they've been running that black off since at least 1984 under Rex 84.
[22:55.160 --> 23:00.160]  And so PDD 51 and others may be secret.
[23:00.160 --> 23:01.160]  We have the cover sheet.
[23:01.160 --> 23:03.160]  It says the government's a dictatorship.
[23:03.160 --> 23:08.160]  They have public declarations of emergency each year, meaning it's a dictatorship of the Pentagon.
[23:08.160 --> 23:14.160]  But this isn't where they've got troops marching up and down, smoking cigars like it's Guatemala.
[23:14.160 --> 23:20.160]  This is all covert, but it's all right there, ladies and gentlemen.
[23:20.160 --> 23:27.160]  And it is the shadow government that implements the snatching of 1.4 million American children each year.
[23:27.160 --> 23:35.160]  It is the shadow government that ships in the heroin and cocaine and pushes the school programs to put your children on Ritalin and Prozac and hundreds of other deadly drugs.
[23:35.160 --> 23:39.160]  They run it all, ladies and gentlemen, and you're all a business.
[23:39.160 --> 23:46.160]  And it's all about making you wards of the state, psychiatric wards, drug addict wards, prisoner wards, welfare wards.
[23:46.160 --> 23:50.160]  We have all the government handbooks, documents I've had, former head of the Treasury,
[23:50.160 --> 23:55.160]  former head of policy number two, Department of Education, where they go into meetings and be told all this.
[23:55.160 --> 23:58.160]  And so don't tell me if something like this was happening, it wouldn't be public.
[23:58.160 --> 23:59.160]  It is public.
[23:59.160 --> 24:03.160]  It's just you and your childlike little world don't know it.
[24:03.160 --> 24:09.160]  Do not tell me that they didn't bring hundreds of thousands of dollars to the police chief of San Antonio.
[24:09.160 --> 24:10.160]  And he said no.
[24:10.160 --> 24:16.160]  Then he called his colleagues, the fire chief, the mayor, and they said, what, you didn't take it?
[24:16.160 --> 24:19.160]  It's called a corruption.
[24:19.160 --> 24:28.160]  Anybody watch that series, Rome, which is based, it's about 95%, 96% historical, where Julius Caesar would do corruptions.
[24:28.160 --> 24:29.160]  He called it a corruption.
[24:29.160 --> 24:35.160]  He would get locals, even in Rome, on his payroll to take payoffs, to go get others to take payoffs.
[24:35.160 --> 24:37.160]  And then they were corrupted.
[24:37.160 --> 24:39.160]  It was called a corruption.
[24:39.160 --> 24:52.160]  The CIA is in the smallest towns, the biggest cities, and they run it all with 16 other public government agencies and over 100 private defense contractors.
[24:52.160 --> 24:57.160]  The private defense contractors like Lockheed and Marietta don't just run the red light cameras in most of your towns.
[24:57.160 --> 24:59.160]  They got their private spook groups.
[24:59.160 --> 25:03.160]  They've got defense budgets and intelligence budgets bigger than the CIA.
[25:03.160 --> 25:08.160]  They're everywhere.
[25:08.160 --> 25:09.160]  All of them.
[25:09.160 --> 25:14.160]  It doesn't matter if it's some rocket propulsion unit like JPL, it doesn't matter who it is.
[25:14.160 --> 25:16.160]  They're all over spooks and it's funny.
[25:16.160 --> 25:20.160]  It's basically mafia.
[25:20.160 --> 25:23.160]  Lockheed Martin.
[25:23.160 --> 25:27.160]  CSIC, the list goes on and on.
[25:27.160 --> 25:28.160]  Warrantless spying.
[25:28.160 --> 25:29.160]  All of them.
[25:29.160 --> 25:31.160]  It's admitted.
[25:31.160 --> 25:33.160]  It's all admitted and that's who they are.
[25:33.160 --> 25:35.160]  Every city has garrisoned.
[25:35.160 --> 25:41.160]  City of Austin has over 100 hit men who just sit there with their cell phones to kill people in Austin if they're needed.
[25:41.160 --> 25:43.160]  Do you understand that?
[25:43.160 --> 25:47.160]  In New York, they've got over a thousand soldiers, ladies and gentlemen.
[25:47.160 --> 25:52.160]  They've got thousands of soldiers in every major city, hundreds in your medium-sized cities.
[25:52.160 --> 25:54.160]  They've got hit men in the smallest towns.
[25:54.160 --> 25:57.160]  They've got federal intelligence officers in the smallest towns.
[25:57.160 --> 26:01.160]  They haven't killed me because I'm so spot on.
[26:01.160 --> 26:06.160]  They don't want to kill me and draw attention to everything I said because I've reverse engineered what they've done
[26:06.160 --> 26:11.160]  and I've gone out and done the interviews and gotten the documents and gotten it all together and put it all together.
[26:11.160 --> 26:14.160]  And let me tell you, it isn't pretty, ladies and gentlemen.
[26:14.160 --> 26:21.160]  And these people don't play games.
[26:21.160 --> 26:24.160]  We're not playing games here going up against them.
[26:24.160 --> 26:25.160]  They don't control all the media.
[26:25.160 --> 26:26.160]  They don't control all the press.
[26:26.160 --> 26:28.160]  In fact, they don't control a lot of things.
[26:28.160 --> 26:33.160]  They just sit up there and claim, oh, you know, the people they try to corrupt, it's for national security.
[26:33.160 --> 26:36.160]  And let me tell you why they're in trouble right now.
[26:36.160 --> 26:44.160]  Because hundreds of prominent former CIA section chiefs and top analysts and field commanders have gone public and have said,
[26:44.160 --> 26:53.160]  this is a national security police state control grid, high tech enslavement system being set up.
[26:53.160 --> 26:55.160]  And they don't like it.
[26:55.160 --> 27:00.160]  This is full spectrum dominance of the American people and the people of the world.
[27:00.160 --> 27:02.160]  This is not for the red, white and blue.
[27:02.160 --> 27:04.160]  So they're all saying no to all this.
[27:04.160 --> 27:06.160]  So what's the CIA doing?
[27:06.160 --> 27:14.160]  They are running radio and TV and print ads everywhere and they are planning to triple their size and basically fire everyone.
[27:14.160 --> 27:16.160]  And now they're looking for felons.
[27:16.160 --> 27:18.160]  Let me give you a little tip here.
[27:18.160 --> 27:19.160]  They want aggravated felons.
[27:19.160 --> 27:21.160]  They're hiring child molesters.
[27:21.160 --> 27:23.160]  They're hiring crooks.
[27:23.160 --> 27:26.160]  Now, they've always done that as operatives.
[27:26.160 --> 27:34.160]  They've always done that for people they handle, for assets, that the handlers control.
[27:34.160 --> 27:42.160]  But now they are making up the course of army intelligence, defense intelligence with sickos.
[27:42.160 --> 27:47.160]  Who do you think they peopled Abu Ghraib and hundreds of other camps around the world with?
[27:47.160 --> 27:48.160]  It's admitted.
[27:48.160 --> 27:54.160]  They would go find former federal prison guards and state prison guards who'd lost jobs for raping prisoners and beating them.
[27:54.160 --> 27:58.160]  And then they go look at their Google account and see what they're visiting online to a psychological profile.
[27:58.160 --> 28:00.160]  Oh yeah, everybody's got one.
[28:00.160 --> 28:03.160]  And then they go hire them.
[28:03.160 --> 28:05.160]  But that is enough.
[28:05.160 --> 28:08.160]  I told you this 10 years ago, now it's mainstream news.
[28:08.160 --> 28:20.160]  They're hiring not just foreigners to fill up the military and intelligence, but they're hiring former death squad brigades out of Venezuela, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Brazil.
[28:20.160 --> 28:22.160]  And guess who else they're hiring?
[28:22.160 --> 28:23.160]  Aggravated felons.
[28:23.160 --> 28:24.160]  I mean rapists.
[28:24.160 --> 28:26.160]  That's mainstream news.
[28:26.160 --> 28:32.160]  The mainstream news says though, oh, they're hiring rapists and arsonists because they're good and they'll get the job done.
[28:32.160 --> 28:36.160]  You're an illegitimate bankrupt group of drug dealing sickos.
[28:36.160 --> 28:38.160]  And I'm done with you.
[28:38.160 --> 28:42.160]  And the United States of America declares war on you, black ops.
[28:42.160 --> 28:44.160]  You will be defeated!
[28:54.160 --> 28:58.160]  Imagine walking down the street and hearing footsteps behind you.
[28:58.160 --> 29:03.160]  They get closer and closer and suddenly you have a sense something bad is going to happen.
[29:03.160 --> 29:05.160]  What are you going to do to defend yourself?

[29:50.160 --> 29:57.160]  Drank and Mate proudly presents another mind-boggling episode of America's toughest quiz show.
[29:57.160 --> 29:59.160]  That's too complicated.
[29:59.160 --> 30:05.160]  Let's see if we can figure out which contestant got the intellectual edge after an evening of partying by using Drank and Mate.
[30:05.160 --> 30:13.160]  For 20 points in the win, Milt, Glurr5 and Blank, Kynate receptor subunits and hippocampal neurons co-assembled to form functional receptors.
[30:13.160 --> 30:15.160]  Uh, uh, Pony?
[30:15.160 --> 30:18.160]  Oh, too bad. Yes, Chip.
[30:18.160 --> 30:22.160]  The logical companion of Glurr5, Glurr6.
[30:22.160 --> 30:23.160]  You've won the game!
[30:23.160 --> 30:28.160]  Hey, life is like a game, and if you want to win, you've got to give it your best every day,
[30:28.160 --> 30:31.160]  which doesn't always happen after an evening of celebrating with friends and family.
[30:31.160 --> 30:37.160]  That's why there's Drank and Mate, a patented formula of Guavali-fextract proven to reduce the effects of hangover.
[30:37.160 --> 30:42.160]  It restores balance to your body, keeping headaches and nausea at bay, and it really works.
[30:42.160 --> 30:43.160]  Tell them, Don,
[30:43.160 --> 30:49.160]  Drank and Mate, I wouldn't be able to read this without it. Available at Quality Retailers nationwide.
[30:49.160 --> 30:52.160]  Drank and Mate urges you to please drink responsibly.
[30:52.160 --> 30:59.160]  Since the year 2000, earthquakes, heat waves, droughts, tsunamis, floods, fires and hurricanes have killed over one million people worldwide
[30:59.160 --> 31:02.160]  and forced tens of millions to go without food and water.
[31:02.160 --> 31:06.160]  After Katrina, the media was eager to show victims in New Orleans begging for food.
[31:06.160 --> 31:11.160]  If a disaster strikes you and your loved ones and you have no stored food, you'll be begging as well.
[31:11.160 --> 31:17.160]  Now our economy is slipping into an abyss that even Donald Trump says will make the Great Depression look like a Sunday picnic.
[31:17.160 --> 31:20.160]  The US dollar is worth less today than it was even last week.
[31:20.160 --> 31:24.160]  Before food prices skyrocket, trucks stop running and stores close their doors.
[31:24.160 --> 31:27.160]  Survival enterprises can help you prepare.
[31:27.160 --> 31:31.160]  They're master distributors of Mountain House freeze-dried food with up to a 50-year shelf life.
[31:31.160 --> 31:38.160]  Survival enterprises has real butter, cheese and bread, real beef, chicken and turkey, all canned for long-term storage.

[33:01.160 --> 33:13.160]  Hey, you know, Motley Crue has been playing my videos at their concerts for the last years.
[33:13.160 --> 33:16.160]  I guess it's the only fair we play some of their music.
[33:16.160 --> 33:19.160]  Now listen up, New World Order.
[33:19.160 --> 33:23.160]  You're a bunch of degenerate scum.
[33:23.160 --> 33:33.160]  You're going to get cut down to size.
[33:33.160 --> 33:37.160]  Cool, cool blonde. She moves like a cat.
[33:37.160 --> 33:53.160]  And if she gets your name, well, you might not.
[33:53.160 --> 33:56.160]  Well, I'm looking it up.
[33:56.160 --> 34:01.160]  Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson, that guy's got the looks to kill.
[34:01.160 --> 34:05.160]  He is the biggest bank robber in U.S. history.
[34:05.160 --> 34:09.160]  Him and his boys have looted about 60 trillion out of the economy.
[34:09.160 --> 34:11.160]  Right into those Swiss accounts.
[34:11.160 --> 34:13.160]  Yeah, you heard me right.
[34:13.160 --> 34:16.160]  60 plus trillion conservatively if you leverage it.
[34:16.160 --> 34:18.160]  It's in the thousands of trillions.
[34:18.160 --> 34:19.160]  Oh, you want sources.
[34:19.160 --> 34:24.160]  AP headlines September 10th, 2001.
[34:24.160 --> 34:28.160]  1.9 trillion missing from Pentagon funds.
[34:28.160 --> 34:31.160]  And some of the geniuses out there will say,
[34:31.160 --> 34:35.160]  hey, wait a minute.
[34:35.160 --> 34:39.160]  Alex, the whole defense budget is only 80 billion a year.
[34:39.160 --> 34:43.160]  Well, see, a large portion of that is put in comprehensive annual financial reports
[34:43.160 --> 34:48.160]  or in investments and in pension funds.
[34:48.160 --> 34:53.160]  All of that and more has been taken and then the Pentagon borrowed money
[34:53.160 --> 34:56.160]  and then it was handed directly to offshore corporations.
[34:56.160 --> 34:59.160]  I mean, generals would get billions of peace.
[34:59.160 --> 35:02.160]  But, you know, the head guys were talking trillions.
[35:02.160 --> 35:04.160]  But what do the privates get in Iraq?
[35:04.160 --> 35:07.160]  They get 35,000 secret cash.
[35:07.160 --> 35:09.160]  Now, admitted, we told you years before it was in the news,
[35:09.160 --> 35:12.160]  those big pallets of billions of cash are flowing every day.
[35:12.160 --> 35:14.160]  And then that's a corruption.
[35:14.160 --> 35:16.160]  And then the troops are offered more.
[35:16.160 --> 35:18.160]  They say, here's 100 grand to kill your captain.
[35:18.160 --> 35:21.160]  He's been blowing the whistle about what we're doing here.
[35:21.160 --> 35:24.160]  You know, old dying course flying some kids out.
[35:24.160 --> 35:25.160]  Oh, yeah.
[35:25.160 --> 35:27.160]  And so they just, there's been record numbers of,
[35:27.160 --> 35:32.160]  they're killing in the military all the investigation arms that were not corrupted.
[35:32.160 --> 35:36.160]  See, the cancer is racing through everything right now.
[35:36.160 --> 35:38.160]  They're killing the investigators.
[35:38.160 --> 35:40.160]  They're killing the good FBI agents.
[35:40.160 --> 35:44.160]  They're killing the good CIA people or they're demonizing them or setting them up.
[35:44.160 --> 35:48.160]  And then they're just hiring the felons and the criminals and the murderers
[35:48.160 --> 35:52.160]  and just grabbing the gang members and doing the psychological assessments
[35:52.160 --> 36:02.160]  for psychopaths that don't have records and just building their army of Mordor.
[36:02.160 --> 36:04.160]  It's so much fun for them.
[36:04.160 --> 36:08.160]  And then they tell you, oh, oh, yeah, that was eight years ago, seven and a half years ago.
[36:08.160 --> 36:12.160]  Guess how much is missing from the Pentagon now?
[36:12.160 --> 36:15.160]  Last time I saw a congressional hearing on it and the Pentagon says
[36:15.160 --> 36:17.160]  they will not discuss it national security.
[36:17.160 --> 36:24.160]  And then they mentioned PDD 51. That means Congress no longer has authority.
[36:24.160 --> 36:26.160]  And Congress says, that's right.
[36:26.160 --> 36:29.160]  Now, of course, Congress is co-equal to the president.
[36:29.160 --> 36:34.160]  So how could the presidency say you have no authority and cannot even see what we're doing?
[36:34.160 --> 36:38.160]  Well, they don't have the paramilitary forces or the nukes or the neutron bombs.
[36:38.160 --> 36:43.160]  You see an official U.S. government and British government documents like last year's
[36:43.160 --> 36:48.160]  100-something page British Ministry of Defense 10-year perspective
[36:48.160 --> 36:50.160]  where they look forward and predict.
[36:50.160 --> 36:53.160]  They say that if anyone tries to take over the British government,
[36:53.160 --> 36:55.160]  i.e. the people or even the parliament,
[36:55.160 --> 36:59.160]  or if the people in the U.S. were to say try to march on Washington and take it over,
[36:59.160 --> 37:03.160]  a neutron bomb will be dropped on you.
[37:03.160 --> 37:06.160]  Oh, you don't believe me there. That's official policy.
[37:06.160 --> 37:11.160]  Because they own the banks, they own the neutron bombs, they own the death squads,
[37:11.160 --> 37:14.160]  they own the FEMA camps, they own the coca fields,
[37:14.160 --> 37:18.160]  they own the heroin plantations where they're growing the poppies,
[37:18.160 --> 37:22.160]  and they've got the power and they say, hey, we're the smart people, you're the dumb people,
[37:22.160 --> 37:24.160]  shut up, we're going to take the dollar,
[37:24.160 --> 37:27.160]  we're going to buy up all the real assets in the world in the name of the dollar,
[37:27.160 --> 37:32.160]  and then we're going to deflate it overnight by inflating it and let you hold the bill for it,
[37:32.160 --> 37:39.160]  then leave a vanguard police state behind as we all move to Switzerland and Paraguay and Spain.
[37:39.160 --> 37:45.160]  And if you don't like it, if you don't like it, we'll just release a bio-weapon and say al-Qaeda did it
[37:45.160 --> 37:49.160]  and kill a couple million of you, and then you'll learn how to beg and plead to your government real fast.
[37:49.160 --> 37:53.160]  Won't you?
[37:53.160 --> 37:58.160]  I'm told from high-level sources that actually a lot of globalists listen to this show because they enjoy it.
[37:58.160 --> 38:01.160]  They like it if there's somebody out there telling them what's being done to you
[38:01.160 --> 38:07.160]  because they say you're so cowardly and stupid and pathetic that you won't even do anything about it.
[38:07.160 --> 38:12.160]  You'll go cling to Barack Obama's skirt or to Joe Biden's, oh save me,
[38:12.160 --> 38:17.160]  or you'll go to Sarah or you'll go to John McCain and hang on their skirt.
[38:17.160 --> 38:21.160]  Oh, mommy, mommy, mommy, help me.
[38:21.160 --> 38:23.160]  And they'll go, oh, I'm going to help you real good.
[38:23.160 --> 38:26.160]  I'm going to take everything you've got, slave,
[38:26.160 --> 38:29.160]  and then I'm going to draft your kids claiming it's to fight terrorists
[38:29.160 --> 38:32.160]  and you're going to go back our empire up, aren't you?
[38:32.160 --> 38:34.160]  You're going to say yes, I'll give you my kids.
[38:34.160 --> 38:36.160]  I love being a schmuck and an idiot.
[38:36.160 --> 38:38.160]  I love being conned over and over again.
[38:38.160 --> 38:42.160]  I love being the dumbest people on earth.
[38:42.160 --> 38:44.160]  Let me explain something.
[38:44.160 --> 38:47.160]  The boys that run our country have completely looted it.
[38:47.160 --> 38:49.160]  The last act of a corrupt system is to loot the treasury.
[38:49.160 --> 38:53.160]  They have taken our credit and our name and they bought real assets.
[38:53.160 --> 38:59.160]  They bought themselves villas and oil companies and whole lakes and whole sectors of countries
[38:59.160 --> 39:02.160]  and the Nigerian oil fields.
[39:02.160 --> 39:07.160]  That's come out that Halliburton and Cheney directly hundreds of millions in bribes.
[39:07.160 --> 39:12.160]  Nothing will happen to them. It doesn't matter because they've got men in black uniforms
[39:12.160 --> 39:18.160]  with devil tattoos that can't wait to kill you and your family if they snap their fingers.
[39:18.160 --> 39:23.160]  And all they're waiting for is to sell you on their whole police state apparatus.
[39:23.160 --> 39:26.160]  Play that CIA ad that's airing all over the country.
[39:26.160 --> 39:30.160]  This is them recruiting. This is the type of bull.
[39:30.160 --> 39:34.160]  But hey, if you're not a felon or if you don't have a psychopathic web surfing,
[39:34.160 --> 39:38.160]  which they're tracking and watching your psychological profile, do not go apply.
[39:38.160 --> 40:01.160]  Here it is.
[40:08.160 --> 40:10.160]  Oh, yeah.
[40:38.160 --> 40:41.160]  All right, let me tell you how this really works.
[40:41.160 --> 40:44.160]  Okay, let's say you go fill out the paperwork.
[40:44.160 --> 40:48.160]  You're the captain of the football team. You're a college football guy.
[40:48.160 --> 40:53.160]  You believe in America. You don't know Al Qaeda was the name of a computer program in 79.
[40:53.160 --> 40:57.160]  For Muslim extremists working for the CIA, you think you're smart.
[40:57.160 --> 41:00.160]  You think you're intellectual because you watch Frontline.
[41:00.160 --> 41:03.160]  And you want to go join like Pat Tillman did.
[41:03.160 --> 41:06.160]  You want to go join Special Forces. You want to go join the Army.
[41:06.160 --> 41:09.160]  You want to go join the CIA. You want to go join Defense Intelligence.
[41:09.160 --> 41:13.160]  They'll have questionnaires. They'll have your whole web surfing history.
[41:13.160 --> 41:15.160]  You'll never be told that you're compartmentalized.
[41:15.160 --> 41:21.160]  And if you're a good guy, they're going to have you out BSing the local villagers living with them
[41:21.160 --> 41:24.160]  for three years in your Peace Corps front to take vaccines.
[41:24.160 --> 41:29.160]  And because you believe it's really helping him, you'll be the perfect salesman to sterilize those people
[41:29.160 --> 41:34.160]  and you'll be rotated out before you ever notice that you killed that whole village.
[41:34.160 --> 41:38.160]  Or by the time you notice and learn about how you help kill the whole village,
[41:38.160 --> 41:43.160]  oh, it'll be too far down the road. You'll be too deep in now.
[41:43.160 --> 41:45.160]  You'll know your phones are being listened to.
[41:45.160 --> 41:49.160]  You'll know your spook wife they stuck you with is really your handler.
[41:49.160 --> 41:51.160]  See, again, it goes on and on and on.
[41:51.160 --> 41:56.160]  You want to work with a bunch of backstabbing, lying, drug dealing, child kidnapping filth.
[41:56.160 --> 42:00.160]  Oh, I mean, they've got all these compartmentalized nice guys.
[42:00.160 --> 42:07.160]  You are nice fellas who work after the football team to give congressman tours around the CIA building.
[42:07.160 --> 42:09.160]  Maybe you can get a job doing that.
[42:09.160 --> 42:15.160]  Or you might just be an analyst who goes out and collects field data, you know, in some third world nation.
[42:15.160 --> 42:20.160]  Or you may be the good front of the CIA that goes and gives water purifiers to kids,
[42:20.160 --> 42:27.160]  but that's only so in that area of Africa that you'll be trusted so they can then bring in more people behind you.
[42:27.160 --> 42:30.160]  You understand how that works?
[42:30.160 --> 42:35.160]  And I don't want to, and let's say they teach you the Machiavellian view that justifies the means.
[42:35.160 --> 42:39.160]  So the world's so evil, the world's so tough. Alex, you just can't handle the truth.
[42:39.160 --> 42:45.160]  You know, we've got to bring the narcotics into the country because if we don't, some other nation will get control of that.
[42:45.160 --> 42:48.160]  People are always going to want drugs.
[42:48.160 --> 42:51.160]  People are always going to want drugs.
[42:51.160 --> 42:57.160]  And you know, I know exactly what you're thinking when it comes to this economy.
[42:57.160 --> 43:00.160]  The banks are crashing, the stock market's a mess.
[43:00.160 --> 43:03.160]  There's the mortgage crisis. There's the lending crisis.
[43:03.160 --> 43:08.160]  There is the food and gasoline prices through the ceiling crisis.
[43:08.160 --> 43:11.160]  And we are paralyzed a little bit. We don't know exactly how to respond to it.
[43:11.160 --> 43:14.160]  I don't know what to say. What can you do? Do what you can do.
[43:14.160 --> 43:16.160]  That's what you do. You do what you can do.
[43:16.160 --> 43:18.160]  What I can do is I can put some food away.

[47:00.160 --> 47:22.160]  We are back live. Huge stack of news. Loaded phone lines. Gary, Steve, Jason, Robert, George, Gage, Randall. We're going to get to all of you here in just a few minutes.
[47:22.160 --> 47:37.160]  I've been ranting the last 45 minutes or so, mainly just about how black ops, which are just private corporate mafia muscle with a membrane of U.S. government front, is taking over society.
[47:37.160 --> 47:45.160]  Now they're handing most of the military, most of intelligence gathering, city streets, government ownership to private corporations.
[47:45.160 --> 47:58.160]  So again, they took our money. They took our dollar. The private banks issued unlimited liquidity to themselves, but backed up by the U.S. population to then come back and buy our governments up.
[47:58.160 --> 48:05.160]  It's in the IMF World Bank documents. They got leaked in 2002. They were already well into doing it. Now here we are six years later under the yoke.
[48:05.160 --> 48:11.160]  You better find out real soon. We're being criminally looted like a bank robbery.
[48:11.160 --> 48:22.160]  We got Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. What is it? 50-something trillion dollars we're talking about? Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of billions that were in default but leveraged.
[48:22.160 --> 48:30.160]  Just trillions and trillions and trillions. It's all a big mistake. It was all a big accident. Oh, we don't know what happened.
[48:30.160 --> 48:37.160]  And now it's being federalized. That means you're going to back it up. You're going to pay for it.
[48:37.160 --> 48:44.160]  You understand? And if you look at what these executives and what these stockholders and what these companies did, a lot of it's not even stockholding.
[48:44.160 --> 48:52.160]  It'll just be the executives or intelligence operatives or private intelligence operatives, and they'll just steal hundreds of billions a day sometimes.
[48:52.160 --> 49:03.160]  I mean, it's just unlimited. These guys, this makes the Russian looting under the oligarchs look like a kid stealing a stick of bubblegum next to robbing Fort Knox.
[49:03.160 --> 49:09.160]  And for all of you that are getting into intelligence, the local police are being co-opted to these threat management centers.
[49:09.160 --> 49:13.160]  And, you know, oh, these were originally for hurricanes, originally for fires.
[49:13.160 --> 49:17.160]  But now the CIA and the military are in the same office with your local police.
[49:17.160 --> 49:24.160]  And, you know, when we track everybody off their cell phones and have all this new federal gadgetry in here, the feds are taking over.
[49:24.160 --> 49:30.160]  Period. And they are owned by private corporations. They are owned and completely whored out and run.
[49:30.160 --> 49:35.160]  And so a lot of you who are going to get into intelligence, you're going to be the goofballs they laugh at in black ops.
[49:35.160 --> 49:41.160]  You're just the front and the paper pushers, those of you that are in intelligence that aren't evil.
[49:41.160 --> 49:49.160]  And you've all been profiled, the Dudley Dew ride, who's on a power trip with his pocket protector and his computer, feeling good about himself,
[49:49.160 --> 49:55.160]  while you're part of a whole false reality of what goes on in the whole Cloak and Dagger world.
[49:55.160 --> 50:03.160]  Oh, man. You know, reading some of the Foreign Service magazines, I was in a doctor's office the other day.
[50:03.160 --> 50:11.160]  And I was reading the one, and it was just all this bull and all, and again, it would hold up troops who were real heroes.
[50:11.160 --> 50:17.160]  You know, some Marine Corps captain who had his eyes blown out, who runs marathons.
[50:17.160 --> 50:25.160]  I think it was Captain Castro. And you can't help but admire him and his courage to go to Iraq and his courage to be in harm's way
[50:25.160 --> 50:30.160]  and his courage to run these marathons now when he was in a coma for six weeks and couldn't walk when he woke up.
[50:30.160 --> 50:34.160]  But see, they sandwiched that in there with all the propaganda and evil.
[50:34.160 --> 50:37.160]  And see, that's only one little tactic of thousands they're using.
[50:37.160 --> 50:42.160]  And my brain just burns with understanding of the enemy operations because I study it.
[50:42.160 --> 50:45.160]  They say what they're doing. It's public. They laugh at you.
[50:45.160 --> 50:51.160]  It's like chemtrails. It's like chemtrails.
[50:51.160 --> 50:56.160]  Well, somebody come in here and unlock this computer system. It just locked up, and I can't do it while I'm on here. Thanks.
[50:56.160 --> 51:01.160]  I want to go to calls, but I can't. The computer system locks up every five minutes once a passcode, and I just can't do it while I'm here on here.
[51:01.160 --> 51:03.160]  You got to enter like three of them or something.
[51:03.160 --> 51:07.160]  Just come on around here and enter the code into this so I can use it. Thank you.
[51:07.160 --> 51:09.160]  Unbelievable.
[51:09.160 --> 51:11.160]  They ought to have this disabled in here for the talk show host.
[51:11.160 --> 51:21.160]  Anyways, just to know this is going on makes me angry.
[51:21.160 --> 51:29.160]  But all these major newspapers come out and say, okay, the government's got a huge secret program going on since the mid-nineties when we told you it was,
[51:29.160 --> 51:33.160]  spraying deadly poison on the people.
[51:33.160 --> 51:37.160]  I'm going to cover this later after I take some phone calls. Thank you.
[51:37.160 --> 51:43.160]  U.S. government mad scientist, geoengineer atmosphere. That's Paul Watson's headline on infowars.com and prisonplanet.com.
[51:43.160 --> 51:50.160]  But when you read it, we've got links to all the mainstream news universities where they admit that they're spraying all these poisons to, quote,
[51:50.160 --> 51:55.160]  save us from global warming, which is bold to begin with.
[51:55.160 --> 52:01.160]  So we're going to break all that down for you. And yes, that's a perfect example of how they've got compartmentalization.
[52:01.160 --> 52:08.160]  There's six major kerosene jet fuel suppliers. That's what jet fuel is, is a type of kerosene.
[52:08.160 --> 52:12.160]  Six major companies that have got over 90%. There's a few other little stragglers.
[52:12.160 --> 52:15.160]  And they supply the fuel, and then it's just mixed in there.
[52:15.160 --> 52:21.160]  And some planes actually have sprayers on them, and then it's designed to go through the jet engines and be sprayed out,
[52:21.160 --> 52:29.160]  then create nuclei that then cause particulate to start forming and to form raindroplets.
[52:29.160 --> 52:35.160]  Remember, trails, condensation trails before 96 only lasted a few minutes. Now they're there for hours.
[52:35.160 --> 52:38.160]  That's how dumb they think you are that you wouldn't notice that.
[52:38.160 --> 52:41.160]  Well, now they just admit what they're doing. We'll tell you about that later.
[52:41.160 --> 52:43.160]  After I take every call that's on this board.
[52:43.160 --> 52:48.160]  Jason in Las Vegas, which is also Mafia New World Order Run.
[52:48.160 --> 52:51.160]  You're on the air. Thanks for holding.
[52:51.160 --> 52:54.160]  Go ahead, Jason.
[52:54.160 --> 52:59.160]  Okay, Jason's gone. Let's go ahead and talk to Steve in Texas. Steve, you're on the air.
[52:59.160 --> 53:05.160]  Yeah, good afternoon, Alex. You know, I've been listening to you for quite a while now.
[53:05.160 --> 53:12.160]  And of course, you're talking about the divide and conquer mentality that these people are promoting.
[53:12.160 --> 53:17.160]  And I really see a polarization happening in this country.
[53:17.160 --> 53:26.160]  And, you know, in the new movie you've got out that Jason has out, you know, it has this quarrel right at the end from Giuliani.
[53:26.160 --> 53:29.160]  You know, if you're not with us, you're with the terrorists.
[53:29.160 --> 53:38.160]  And I'm saying this more and more because in talking to, you know, the average person about this stuff, you get one of two reactions now.
[53:38.160 --> 53:44.160]  It's either, oh, you're one of those crazy conspiracy theories. It's like a knee jerk during the headlight.
[53:44.160 --> 53:50.160]  No, it's a cover story. It's a, I don't have to think. I'll just throw this term out.
[53:50.160 --> 53:56.160]  Right. Or you get the people who are starting to do what they were designed to do by their creator.
[53:56.160 --> 54:03.160]  And that's use that brain God gave you and think critically because you see all these cameras going up everywhere.
[54:03.160 --> 54:05.160]  You see more and more.
[54:05.160 --> 54:09.160]  And by the way, the Pentagon admits that's Pentagon designed as a slave grid.
[54:09.160 --> 54:14.160]  We are an enemy force. The American people have been listed as an enemy force by North com.
[54:14.160 --> 54:17.160]  This is official. The military openly is against us.
[54:17.160 --> 54:20.160]  And that doesn't mean your kid who's in the Marines, folks.
[54:20.160 --> 54:23.160]  Go look at a North com, look into PDD 51.
[54:23.160 --> 54:27.160]  Yeah. And, you know, Dallas, I'm thinking about all these things that you talk about.
[54:27.160 --> 54:30.160]  I mean, you know, you talk about so much on your show.
[54:30.160 --> 54:38.160]  And, you know, the picture is here, they're incrementally poisoning the population through the vaccine, the drugs, the food supply and the wire.
[54:38.160 --> 54:40.160]  And they admit they are.
[54:40.160 --> 54:46.160]  They're militarizing the police. They're programming and dumbing down the population through the media, Hollywood, the schools.
[54:46.160 --> 54:49.160]  They're passing legislation and executive orders.
[54:49.160 --> 54:53.160]  They're engineering terror attacks and they're tracking and monitoring everybody.
[54:53.160 --> 54:57.160]  And then they're systematically dismantling the family through the promotion of...
[54:57.160 --> 55:01.160]  And they're hiring felons and criminals for the CIA and military.
[55:01.160 --> 55:03.160]  We are in red level emergency.
[55:03.160 --> 55:06.160]  Right. And yet you talk to people and it's like,
[55:06.160 --> 55:11.160]  don't you do anything besides wonder who's the latest winner of American Idolatry?
[55:11.160 --> 55:13.160]  No, no, listen, listen, I hear you.
[55:13.160 --> 55:19.160]  But you can't worry about those who men in black uniforms could be butchering babies on street corners.
[55:19.160 --> 55:21.160]  They would say they didn't see it.
[55:21.160 --> 55:28.160]  You got to just...it was 5% on the Revolutionary War against the Redcoats in 1776, 1775 when it all kicked off.
[55:28.160 --> 55:32.160]  It went through 1783, 1884.
[55:32.160 --> 55:39.160]  Again, we can obsess all day on the losers, the cowards, the idiots, the moron liberals, the moron conservatives,
[55:39.160 --> 55:42.160]  who don't know that both parties are bought and paid for.
[55:42.160 --> 55:47.160]  I mean, the Democrats send the Democrats there to end the war and the war expands.
[55:47.160 --> 55:51.160]  It doesn't matter what we want. It doesn't matter what's constitutional.
[55:51.160 --> 55:56.160]  The government does the opposite in every case of what the people want or say.
[55:56.160 --> 56:00.160]  Unless it's, quote, give us money, give us welfare.
[56:00.160 --> 56:05.160]  All they do is create debt that the private bankers, then while the money's still worth something,
[56:05.160 --> 56:08.160]  they go buy real assets and they leave us holding the bag.
[56:12.160 --> 56:16.160]  It's unbelievable. Folks, you're going to get hurt so bad by this new world order.
[56:16.160 --> 56:21.160]  There is no doubt that every major vaccine causes diabetes and attacks the pancreas.
[56:21.160 --> 56:26.160]  Just type diabetes vaccines into Google, British Medical Journal, every major journal.
[56:26.160 --> 56:29.160]  They've known it for 30 years. It was designed that way.
[56:29.160 --> 56:35.160]  There's no doubt we went from 1 in 25,000 having autism to 1 in 86 in the last 20 years with the mercury.
[56:35.160 --> 56:39.160]  The feds now admit it. Still in there, by the way. Hadn't been taken out.
[56:39.160 --> 56:43.160]  They've made a few types and subgroups of vaccines available in small lots.
[56:43.160 --> 56:45.160]  They want to be technical. They don't have it.
[56:45.160 --> 56:47.160]  They play lawyer semantic games.
[56:47.160 --> 56:53.160]  There is no doubt that Bayer Pharmaceuticals shipped out over a million dosages of factor 8
[56:53.160 --> 56:58.160]  knowing each shot had HIV and hepatitis A, B, and C in it.
[56:58.160 --> 57:02.160]  Just type in to Google. You'll be seeing mainstream TV, mainstream news.
[57:04.160 --> 57:10.160]  Bayer Pharmaceutical knowingly for more than a decade shipped this out, killing hundreds of thousands.
[57:12.160 --> 57:16.160]  And the media, the only spin in the media is that they did it for profit.
[57:16.160 --> 57:19.160]  No, they knew. They're a eugenics organization.
[57:19.160 --> 57:25.160]  You understand this isn't a game. People are still talking about Tylenol accidentally having cyanide in it
[57:25.160 --> 57:29.160]  20 years ago and a few people dying. This was hundreds of thousands dead,
[57:29.160 --> 57:33.160]  hundreds of thousands more to die, and they knew it had AIDS in it.
[57:33.160 --> 57:38.160]  And they shipped it out on purpose. Why? My film in-game covers it.
[57:38.160 --> 57:42.160]  Folks, you better wake up to the horror of reality. We'll be right back with a-
[57:42.160 --> 57:46.160]  It's no secret that Genesis Communications Network depends on listeners like you.

[58:13.160 --> 58:16.160]  Are your Federal Reserve notes looking for a safe haven?
[58:16.160 --> 58:18.160]  Mine found it in precious metals.
[58:18.160 --> 58:22.160]  Not paper promises, but actual gold in my possession.
[58:22.160 --> 58:25.160]  It is liquid. It is private. It owes no one.
[58:25.160 --> 58:29.160]  It cannot go bankrupt, and it maintains its purchasing power.
[58:29.160 --> 58:36.160]  Find your answer at Midas Resources. That's 1-800-686-2237.
[58:36.160 --> 58:40.160]  The answer is at 1-800-686-2237.
[58:42.160 --> 58:45.160]  It's a fact. Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913,
[58:45.160 --> 58:50.160]  all banks in these United States create money out of thin air for every single loan they issue,
[58:50.160 --> 58:54.160]  with never ending late fees over the limit fees and higher and higher interest rates,
[58:54.160 --> 58:59.160]  it has become mathematically impossible to repay all debt, making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[58:59.160 --> 59:03.160]  The Federal Debt Relief System has created a successful attorney backed program
[59:03.160 --> 59:07.160]  to legally eliminate credit card debt, personal loans, lines of credit,
[59:07.160 --> 59:10.160]  and other unsecured debts which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[59:10.160 --> 59:14.160]  We can terminate your unsecured debt within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment,
[59:14.160 --> 59:16.160]  ending with nothing on your credit report.
[59:16.160 --> 59:21.160]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe with a sigh of relief because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[59:21.160 --> 59:26.160]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration, it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[59:26.160 --> 59:30.160]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System at 877-943-8600.
[59:30.160 --> 59:35.160]  That's 877-943-8600, or visit FDRS.org.
[59:35.160 --> 59:38.160]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[59:38.160 --> 59:49.160]  Visit FDRS.org today.
[1:00:18.160 --> 1:00:21.160]  The top executives of both institutions got the axe.
[1:00:21.160 --> 1:00:25.160]  They've been replaced by Herb Allison, the former vice chairman of Merrill Lynch.
[1:00:25.160 --> 1:00:27.160]  He will head Freddie May.
[1:00:27.160 --> 1:00:32.160]  And David Moffat, former vice chairman of U.S. Bank Corp. was chosen to head Freddie Mac.
[1:00:32.160 --> 1:00:36.160]  Powerful and deadly hurricane ikes barreling toward the Gulf of Mexico.
[1:00:36.160 --> 1:00:41.160]  Forecasters say the Category 4 storm could intensify before it moves into Cuba late today.
[1:00:41.160 --> 1:00:47.160]  The United States oil companies with installations in the Gulf of Mexico are keeping a wary eye out for ikes.
[1:00:47.160 --> 1:00:50.160]  This is the Information Radio Network.
[1:00:50.160 --> 1:00:57.160]  psoriasis, the itching, flaking and irritation is painful, but the emotional suffering can be even more devastating.
[1:00:57.160 --> 1:01:00.160]  My body was so sore, my mind was so worn out, I could not sleep at night.
[1:01:00.160 --> 1:01:03.160]  I felt self-conscious, nobody knows what that flaking is.
[1:01:03.160 --> 1:01:06.160]  It just made me feel like you're dirty.
[1:01:06.160 --> 1:01:09.160]  Of course I felt self-conscious, not very attractive to look at.
[1:01:09.160 --> 1:01:15.160]  The solution is new and improved skin zinc advanced, the number one OTC treatment for psoriasis.
[1:01:15.160 --> 1:01:17.160]  Skin zinc turned out to be the perfect answer.
[1:01:17.160 --> 1:01:19.160]  Skin zinc has changed my life.
[1:01:19.160 --> 1:01:22.160]  The third day I saw that my psoriasis was disappearing.
[1:01:22.160 --> 1:01:25.160]  One week I noticed that the rashes on my arms were going away.
[1:01:25.160 --> 1:01:27.160]  My elbows are completely cleared up.
[1:01:27.160 --> 1:01:28.160]  You have to try it.
[1:01:28.160 --> 1:01:30.160]  Skin zinc will make your psoriasis go away.
[1:01:30.160 --> 1:01:32.160]  I think we're a skin zinc family for life.

[1:01:50.160 --> 1:01:55.160]  Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama believes John McCain's pick for a running mate,
[1:01:55.160 --> 1:01:58.160]  Governor Sarah Palin, is a skilled politician.
[1:01:58.160 --> 1:02:02.160]  However, he told ABC's this week he thinks McCain chose a vice presidential nominee
[1:02:02.160 --> 1:02:06.160]  who's even more closely aligned with President Bush than McCain himself.
[1:02:06.160 --> 1:02:09.160]  Obama also challenged claims about the McCain campaign
[1:02:09.160 --> 1:02:12.160]  that Palin has more national security experience than he does
[1:02:12.160 --> 1:02:17.160]  due to Alaska's proximity to Russia and her command of the Alaska National Guard.
[1:02:17.160 --> 1:02:20.160]  The United States forces in Iraq will be getting a new leader.
[1:02:20.160 --> 1:02:23.160]  General David Petraeus will hand over command of those forces
[1:02:23.160 --> 1:02:26.160]  to Lieutenant General Raymond Odenero later this month.
[1:02:26.160 --> 1:02:30.160]  There are approximately 146,000 U.S. troops in Iraq.
[1:02:30.160 --> 1:02:33.160]  Petraeus has commanded them for just over a year and a half.
[1:02:33.160 --> 1:02:37.160]  Odenero will be promoted to full general as he takes over command.

[1:03:19.160 --> 1:03:24.160]  Vice President Cheney is continuing his diplomacy over the crisis in Georgia.
[1:03:24.160 --> 1:03:28.160]  He's been visiting Italy, but a foreign minister says Cheney renewed his call
[1:03:28.160 --> 1:03:31.160]  for cooperation between Europe and the United States on Georgia.
[1:03:31.160 --> 1:03:35.160]  Cheney wants Western nations to keep Russia from using his position as an energy supplier
[1:03:35.160 --> 1:03:37.160]  to intimidate its neighbors.
[1:03:37.160 --> 1:03:41.160]  In Islamabad, tests are being conducted on a powder that was sent in envelopes
[1:03:41.160 --> 1:03:44.160]  to two American diplomatic outposts in Pakistan.
[1:03:44.160 --> 1:03:47.160]  A U.S. embassy spokesman says a very small number of people
[1:03:47.160 --> 1:03:51.160]  had contact with the envelopes and that nobody is showing any signs of illness.
[1:03:51.160 --> 1:03:56.160]  From Kandahar, Afghan police say two blasts have gone off at a police headquarters in Kandahar,
[1:03:56.160 --> 1:03:58.160]  and casualties are feared.
[1:03:58.160 --> 1:04:03.160]  One officer says a suicide bomber targeted a police commander in the former Taliban stronghold.
[1:04:03.160 --> 1:04:07.160]  For the first time, Israel's government is talking about paying Jewish settlers
[1:04:07.160 --> 1:04:12.160]  to leave their homes in the West Bank even before a peace deal is signed with the Palestinians
[1:04:12.160 --> 1:04:18.160]  by Minister Ehud Omert, who says a peace agreement would require evacuating settlers.
[1:04:18.160 --> 1:04:20.160]  And the country needs to be thinking about these issues.
[1:04:20.160 --> 1:04:24.160]  Having a machinery still hasn't become the task of lifting huge slabs of rock
[1:04:24.160 --> 1:04:29.160]  from atop the homes of an Egyptian shantytown where at least 31 people are dead
[1:04:29.160 --> 1:04:31.160]  and many more may be buried.
[1:04:31.160 --> 1:04:34.160]  Residents and journalists have been moved away from the site
[1:04:34.160 --> 1:04:37.160]  and it fears that more rocks could break off the cliffs nearby.
[1:04:37.160 --> 1:04:43.160]  And Canada's prime minister is hoping to strengthen the governing position of his conservative minority government.
[1:04:43.160 --> 1:04:46.160]  Stephen Harper has dissolved Canada's parliament.
[1:04:46.160 --> 1:04:49.160]  I'm Pete LaValle, IRN-USA Radio News.

[1:06:19.160 --> 1:06:22.160]  Now live from Austin, Texas.
[1:06:22.160 --> 1:06:25.160]  Here's Alex Jones.
[1:06:25.160 --> 1:06:29.160]  It's really very simple.
[1:06:29.160 --> 1:06:35.160]  Hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of times in the last century,
[1:06:35.160 --> 1:06:41.160]  governments have been looted in Mexico and in South Africa and in Japan.
[1:06:41.160 --> 1:06:44.160]  But nowhere ever.
[1:06:44.160 --> 1:06:52.160]  Russia's probably second bastard 110 years ago and China was being looted by the U.S. and Britain, mainly.
[1:06:52.160 --> 1:06:56.160]  Everybody had a piece of the pie they broke at what, nine, ten pieces.
[1:06:56.160 --> 1:06:58.160]  China.
[1:06:58.160 --> 1:07:00.160]  But that's what empires do.
[1:07:00.160 --> 1:07:02.160]  They go in and they loot the raw resources.
[1:07:02.160 --> 1:07:03.160]  They dumb the public down.
[1:07:03.160 --> 1:07:05.160]  They hire governments to kick people off their property.
[1:07:05.160 --> 1:07:07.160]  They enslave.
[1:07:07.160 --> 1:07:10.160]  And now they've got high-tech propaganda to do it.
[1:07:10.160 --> 1:07:15.160]  And four-plus trillion missing from the Pentagon, completely stolen.
[1:07:15.160 --> 1:07:16.160]  They will not discuss it.
[1:07:16.160 --> 1:07:20.160]  Anybody that talks about it gets murdered or kicked out of Congress.
[1:07:20.160 --> 1:07:22.160]  I mean, that's trillions.
[1:07:22.160 --> 1:07:24.160]  You see, they stole and they stole and they stole.
[1:07:24.160 --> 1:07:27.160]  Imagine 1947, National Security Act.
[1:07:27.160 --> 1:07:28.160]  We already had the robber barons.
[1:07:28.160 --> 1:07:32.160]  They already owned and controlled most of the newspapers, owned most of the land,
[1:07:32.160 --> 1:07:35.160]  owned the railroads, owned most of the mayors.
[1:07:35.160 --> 1:07:40.160]  I mean, they'd have Pinkerton security just come up to people striking 100 years ago,
[1:07:40.160 --> 1:07:43.160]  even 90 years ago, and they would just machine gun whole crowds.
[1:07:43.160 --> 1:07:47.160]  The Rockefellers would hire Pinkerton out in Colorado to go into camps of people,
[1:07:47.160 --> 1:07:50.160]  gold miners, who own their own property and just kill everybody.
[1:07:50.160 --> 1:07:51.160]  Look it up.
[1:07:51.160 --> 1:07:52.160]  Look up Pinkerton massacre.
[1:07:52.160 --> 1:07:54.160]  Stipe that in.
[1:07:54.160 --> 1:07:57.160]  Thousands of times, I mean, they had private contractors.
[1:07:57.160 --> 1:08:01.160]  They would, I mean, you think these Clint Eastwood movies invented this?
[1:08:01.160 --> 1:08:04.160]  No, that's art imitating life.
[1:08:04.160 --> 1:08:06.160]  But it wasn't six guys getting off a train.
[1:08:06.160 --> 1:08:11.160]  It'd be a thousand guys getting off a train and killing an entire town.
[1:08:11.160 --> 1:08:16.160]  I mean, riding down three-year-olds, running in the mud.
[1:08:16.160 --> 1:08:20.160]  Burning them up, killing every man, woman, and child.
[1:08:20.160 --> 1:08:24.160]  That's who these robber barons were 100 years ago.
[1:08:24.160 --> 1:08:26.160]  And they hired sociologists, psychologists.
[1:08:26.160 --> 1:08:27.160]  They hired the best minds.
[1:08:27.160 --> 1:08:29.160]  And they said, we want a dictatorship.
[1:08:29.160 --> 1:08:32.160]  And to use the U.S. and England to set up a world empire, how do we do it?
[1:08:32.160 --> 1:08:35.160]  And they said, OK, you need to hire a young dictator in Germany.
[1:08:35.160 --> 1:08:38.160]  Tell him you're backing him to take over.
[1:08:38.160 --> 1:08:40.160]  This is in the 20s.
[1:08:40.160 --> 1:08:42.160]  British think tanks, these are declassified.
[1:08:42.160 --> 1:08:45.160]  And they went and found Hitler, and they set him up and they turned him loose.
[1:08:45.160 --> 1:08:46.160]  That's just one program.
[1:08:46.160 --> 1:08:51.160]  These people are incredible.
[1:08:51.160 --> 1:08:56.160]  And then they corrupted our own military and our own CIA in 47.
[1:08:56.160 --> 1:09:00.160]  At first, they couldn't find Americans in the intelligence who would deal drugs and kidnap kids.
[1:09:00.160 --> 1:09:02.160]  So they hired Klaus Barbie.
[1:09:02.160 --> 1:09:04.160]  They hired Joseph Mengele.
[1:09:04.160 --> 1:09:07.160]  That was in the AP last week I told you years ago.
[1:09:07.160 --> 1:09:09.160]  To run the child kidnapping.
[1:09:09.160 --> 1:09:10.160]  For the elites want kids.
[1:09:10.160 --> 1:09:11.160]  A lot of money to be made off that.
[1:09:11.160 --> 1:09:18.160]  To run the drugs and Klaus Barbie went in and trained our CIA how to ship heroin and cocaine in.
[1:09:18.160 --> 1:09:20.160]  There were already a bunch of Nazis.
[1:09:20.160 --> 1:09:22.160]  Tens of thousands of them were sent to Central and South America.
[1:09:22.160 --> 1:09:26.160]  They used them as the mercenaries to control the cocaine.
[1:09:26.160 --> 1:09:30.160]  And to start bringing it in here and making it a market.
[1:09:30.160 --> 1:09:34.160]  There's even been information declassified where the CIA at first said,
[1:09:34.160 --> 1:09:36.160]  we don't want police busting people for this.
[1:09:36.160 --> 1:09:38.160]  We want to build a market first.
[1:09:38.160 --> 1:09:41.160]  Then we're going to get these bastards and put them in prison.
[1:09:41.160 --> 1:09:43.160]  You understand the diabolic.
[1:09:43.160 --> 1:09:44.160]  And of course I freak out.
[1:09:44.160 --> 1:09:46.160]  You think I like going head up against these people?
[1:09:46.160 --> 1:09:48.160]  You think I like coming on air and telling you this?
[1:09:48.160 --> 1:09:50.160]  These are some diabolical people.
[1:09:50.160 --> 1:09:51.160]  And I know we got loaded phones.
[1:09:51.160 --> 1:09:53.160]  I said I'd go to them.
[1:09:53.160 --> 1:09:55.160]  It's just we're being looted.
[1:09:55.160 --> 1:09:56.160]  I mean now it isn't enough.
[1:09:56.160 --> 1:09:58.160]  They're killing the goose that lays the golden eggs.
[1:09:58.160 --> 1:10:01.160]  Their evil is bad enough.
[1:10:01.160 --> 1:10:05.160]  But now, and I've had top former White House historians, economists on,
[1:10:05.160 --> 1:10:09.160]  former CIA high level analysts, they're all saying the same thing.
[1:10:09.160 --> 1:10:14.160]  They say it appears that the Western elite is preparing to do a Stalin or Mao
[1:10:14.160 --> 1:10:18.160]  or Hitler mass call and kill millions and totally take everything.
[1:10:18.160 --> 1:10:20.160]  So that's why they're going for broke folks.
[1:10:20.160 --> 1:10:21.160]  They don't care about the pension funds.
[1:10:21.160 --> 1:10:23.160]  They don't care about your future.
[1:10:23.160 --> 1:10:26.160]  That's why 10% of the college grads are homeland security.
[1:10:26.160 --> 1:10:29.160]  I mean, we are going to be the most evil nation ever seen.
[1:10:29.160 --> 1:10:31.160]  And they're going to take everything we've got.
[1:10:31.160 --> 1:10:34.160]  Your restaurants, your car dealerships, all you schmucks
[1:10:34.160 --> 1:10:37.160]  that back up this evil system and go along with it.
[1:10:37.160 --> 1:10:39.160]  They're planning to go with a red level,
[1:10:39.160 --> 1:10:43.160]  the most vicious type of predatory dictatorship ever seen.
[1:10:43.160 --> 1:10:45.160]  And they say they're doing it.
[1:10:45.160 --> 1:10:48.160]  And they're not just going to do it here, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:10:48.160 --> 1:10:51.160]  They are going to do it worldwide.
[1:10:51.160 --> 1:10:57.160]  The most vicious attack pattern ever seen.
[1:10:57.160 --> 1:11:00.160]  And out of that, they're going to take the remnants of what's left
[1:11:00.160 --> 1:11:02.160]  and use us as a Hessian.
[1:11:02.160 --> 1:11:04.160]  The name of a particular county in Germany
[1:11:04.160 --> 1:11:06.160]  that delivered mercenaries out of Prussia.
[1:11:06.160 --> 1:11:09.160]  They are going to use us as a mercenary arm.
[1:11:09.160 --> 1:11:12.160]  You see, if they're going to loot trillions and destroy the economy
[1:11:12.160 --> 1:11:17.160]  and transfer it overseas into their new global corporate structure
[1:11:17.160 --> 1:11:20.160]  backed up by NATO as their military force,
[1:11:20.160 --> 1:11:22.160]  they have to leave a vanguard.
[1:11:22.160 --> 1:11:25.160]  They have to make sure they bring the country down totally.
[1:11:25.160 --> 1:11:28.160]  They have to make sure we never get control of the government again
[1:11:28.160 --> 1:11:30.160]  so they can be punished.
[1:11:30.160 --> 1:11:32.160]  This is all thought out scientifically.
[1:11:32.160 --> 1:11:35.160]  And so that's why we have continuity of government.
[1:11:35.160 --> 1:11:37.160]  That's what the blackout government's about.
[1:11:37.160 --> 1:11:39.160]  That's what all this is about.
[1:11:39.160 --> 1:11:42.160]  It's about committing the crime of history.
[1:11:42.160 --> 1:11:45.160]  Nothing will dwarf it.
[1:11:45.160 --> 1:11:49.160]  And it's about getting away with it, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:11:49.160 --> 1:11:51.160]  God help us.
[1:11:51.160 --> 1:11:53.160]  Because then when you get to the next level,
[1:11:53.160 --> 1:11:55.160]  there are minions just like drugs and money and power
[1:11:55.160 --> 1:11:57.160]  and evil and corruption.
[1:11:57.160 --> 1:12:00.160]  These psychopaths admire the psycho above them and they all feed on each other.
[1:12:00.160 --> 1:12:02.160]  If you look at their criminology.
[1:12:02.160 --> 1:12:04.160]  But up top, it's these bankers and these families
[1:12:04.160 --> 1:12:06.160]  and these people with hyper-200 IQs.
[1:12:06.160 --> 1:12:08.160]  They literally do. That's why they're in control.
[1:12:08.160 --> 1:12:10.160]  But it's not just people with high IQs.
[1:12:10.160 --> 1:12:12.160]  It's psychopathic geniuses.
[1:12:12.160 --> 1:12:14.160]  That's kind of the survival of the fittest.
[1:12:14.160 --> 1:12:17.160]  I mean, if that's real, then that's what the ultimate, penultimate thing is,
[1:12:17.160 --> 1:12:19.160]  is the super predator.
[1:12:19.160 --> 1:12:21.160]  And they're up top going, I will save the earth.
[1:12:21.160 --> 1:12:23.160]  I love my butterfly collection.
[1:12:23.160 --> 1:12:25.160]  I love my sparrow collection.
[1:12:25.160 --> 1:12:27.160]  They have bugs in the bees. They're all dying.
[1:12:27.160 --> 1:12:29.160]  We must kill 90 plus percent.
[1:12:29.160 --> 1:12:32.160]  And it's an official UN documents in Rockefeller and all of it.
[1:12:32.160 --> 1:12:35.160]  And so then you understand why they don't care about killing us
[1:12:35.160 --> 1:12:38.160]  or imprisoning us or selling us heroin and cocaine
[1:12:38.160 --> 1:12:41.160]  or CPSing our kids or putting poison in the water.
[1:12:41.160 --> 1:12:43.160]  Because we are scum and trash
[1:12:43.160 --> 1:12:45.160]  and they have nothing but disdain for us
[1:12:45.160 --> 1:12:49.160]  and they write books about it saying it.
[1:12:49.160 --> 1:12:52.160]  They brag. We tell you what you're doing.
[1:12:52.160 --> 1:12:56.160]  You know, we tell you profane scum.
[1:12:56.160 --> 1:12:58.160]  That's what they call us. What you are.
[1:12:58.160 --> 1:13:00.160]  We tell you profane trash.
[1:13:00.160 --> 1:13:02.160]  What we're going to do to you.
[1:13:02.160 --> 1:13:08.160]  And then we do it to you and you do nothing.
[1:13:08.160 --> 1:13:11.160]  And they are just wiping us out.
[1:13:11.160 --> 1:13:14.160]  Just destroying families, destroying IQs,
[1:13:14.160 --> 1:13:16.160]  cancers exploding, sperm counts are dropping,
[1:13:16.160 --> 1:13:18.160]  women are going infertile.
[1:13:18.160 --> 1:13:20.160]  They're running eugenics on us.
[1:13:20.160 --> 1:13:22.160]  They've taken them thousands of times, sterilizing,
[1:13:22.160 --> 1:13:24.160]  poison, everything else.
[1:13:24.160 --> 1:13:27.160]  Drugs in the water supply in higher levels
[1:13:27.160 --> 1:13:30.160]  and they could be from the secretions through the sewer systems
[1:13:30.160 --> 1:13:32.160]  in areas that aren't connected to sewer systems.
[1:13:32.160 --> 1:13:34.160]  They're drugging the water. They're drugging the air.
[1:13:34.160 --> 1:13:36.160]  They're attacking you.
[1:13:36.160 --> 1:13:38.160]  And they tell you what they're doing.
[1:13:38.160 --> 1:13:40.160]  They throw it in your face.
[1:13:40.160 --> 1:13:42.160]  I was watching the first Batman the other day.
[1:13:42.160 --> 1:13:45.160]  And then they go, you know, we need to stage some terror attacks
[1:13:45.160 --> 1:13:47.160]  to make you mayor and blame it on Batman.
[1:13:47.160 --> 1:13:51.160]  How about something like the Reichstag or the Gulf of Tonkin?
[1:13:51.160 --> 1:13:54.160]  And then they go and put together different cosmetics
[1:13:54.160 --> 1:13:56.160]  that when you put them together make you sick
[1:13:56.160 --> 1:13:59.160]  and then they sell you the drug.
[1:13:59.160 --> 1:14:02.160]  And they made more than five or six,
[1:14:02.160 --> 1:14:05.160]  count them up, movies where the government hijacks a plane
[1:14:05.160 --> 1:14:07.160]  to fly it in the World Trade Center
[1:14:07.160 --> 1:14:09.160]  to blame it on enemies in Afghanistan.
[1:14:09.160 --> 1:14:12.160]  I mean, just throw it in your face over and over
[1:14:12.160 --> 1:14:14.160]  and over and over and over and over again.
[1:14:14.160 --> 1:14:17.160]  It's such a joke. Tom Clancy writes a book,
[1:14:17.160 --> 1:14:19.160]  puts out a video game to accompany it
[1:14:19.160 --> 1:14:22.160]  about the U.S. sneak attacking Russia
[1:14:22.160 --> 1:14:25.160]  in the summer of 2008 and 2001.
[1:14:25.160 --> 1:14:27.160]  And where does the U.S. sneak attack?
[1:14:27.160 --> 1:14:31.160]  But in Georgia, he writes a book about a hijacked plane
[1:14:31.160 --> 1:14:34.160]  being flown to the World Trade Center.
[1:14:34.160 --> 1:14:36.160]  They love flaunting it.
[1:14:36.160 --> 1:14:38.160]  All right, I'm not going to say any more.
[1:14:38.160 --> 1:14:40.160]  I promise calls for the rest of the show,
[1:14:40.160 --> 1:14:42.160]  other than some tidbits of news I'm going to hit.
[1:14:42.160 --> 1:14:47.160]  Gary, George, Randall, Gage, Jimmy, Tom.
[1:14:47.160 --> 1:14:49.160]  Everybody else, we're just going to get to you.
[1:14:49.160 --> 1:14:53.160]  I promise when we come back from this call.
[1:14:53.160 --> 1:14:56.160]  So stay with us, ladies and gentlemen.
[1:14:56.160 --> 1:14:58.160]  We'll come back from this break.
[1:14:58.160 --> 1:15:01.160]  It's just, I'm just an average man.
[1:15:01.160 --> 1:15:03.160]  And to discover all of this and to find out
[1:15:03.160 --> 1:15:05.160]  that a lot of intelligentsia, a lot of money,
[1:15:05.160 --> 1:15:07.160]  a lot of smart people, I talked to them,
[1:15:07.160 --> 1:15:09.160]  yeah, go Alex, we know we're joining it.
[1:15:09.160 --> 1:15:11.160]  It's the only way to survive.
[1:15:11.160 --> 1:15:13.160]  We're going to join killing the population.
[1:15:13.160 --> 1:15:15.160]  We're going to join the police state.
[1:15:15.160 --> 1:15:18.160]  And I'm like, my God, these people put fluoride in the water.
[1:15:18.160 --> 1:15:20.160]  Sodium fluoride filled with lead and mercury,
[1:15:20.160 --> 1:15:24.160]  knowing it's, yeah, that's what sodium fluoride is.
[1:15:24.160 --> 1:15:27.160]  And they know, and they know.
[1:15:27.160 --> 1:15:29.160]  They even from the water districts pump it
[1:15:29.160 --> 1:15:31.160]  at five times the level of the black neighborhoods
[1:15:31.160 --> 1:15:32.160]  in the whites.
[1:15:32.160 --> 1:15:34.160]  That's mainstream congressional reports.
[1:15:34.160 --> 1:15:36.160]  They pump lead into the black neighborhoods
[1:15:36.160 --> 1:15:38.160]  and it's in congressional reports.
[1:15:38.160 --> 1:15:40.160]  I mean, I'm living in a hellhole of insanity
[1:15:40.160 --> 1:15:42.160]  and morons running around gobbling cheeseburgers
[1:15:42.160 --> 1:15:44.160]  laughing at it.
[1:15:44.160 --> 1:15:45.160]  It's incredible.
[1:15:45.160 --> 1:15:46.160]  Face the horror.
[1:15:46.160 --> 1:15:49.160]  You want to say what's good.
[1:15:49.160 --> 1:15:50.160]  Gold.
[1:15:50.160 --> 1:15:52.160]  It's like nothing else on earth.
[1:15:52.160 --> 1:15:54.160]  From the Romans through the Renaissance,
[1:15:54.160 --> 1:15:56.160]  from the industrial age to the space age,
[1:15:56.160 --> 1:15:58.160]  gold has weathered the test of time.
[1:15:58.160 --> 1:16:02.160]  For 6,000 years, gold has remained the ultimate store of wealth.
[1:16:02.160 --> 1:16:04.160]  According to the World Gold Council in the U.S. Mint,
[1:16:04.160 --> 1:16:06.160]  demand is at an all-time high.
[1:16:06.160 --> 1:16:09.160]  The stage is being set for the reemergence of gold
[1:16:09.160 --> 1:16:12.160]  as the common sense alternative to a fiat paper currency
[1:16:12.160 --> 1:16:14.160]  that gets weaker every day.

[1:16:48.160 --> 1:16:50.160]  Honey, have you seen the remote?
[1:16:50.160 --> 1:16:52.160]  Sweetie, have you seen my car keys?
[1:16:52.160 --> 1:16:54.160]  I can't find my wallet.
[1:16:54.160 --> 1:16:55.160]  Sound familiar?
[1:16:55.160 --> 1:16:57.160]  Why not save time looking for lost things
[1:16:57.160 --> 1:16:58.160]  and lose the stress instead?
[1:16:58.160 --> 1:17:02.160]  Introducing our Patented Find One Find All Keyfinders,
[1:17:02.160 --> 1:17:04.160]  or FOFA XD for short.
[1:17:04.160 --> 1:17:06.160]  Once a FOFA keyfinder is attached to each of those

[1:17:13.160 --> 1:17:16.160]  or any of them to find an uncharged or muted cell phone.

[1:17:18.160 --> 1:17:20.160]  FOFA goes through walls, cushions, and laundry baskets
[1:17:20.160 --> 1:17:24.160]  up to 30 feet and projects a clear 90-plus decibel beep.

[1:17:25.160 --> 1:17:27.160]  Oh, my keys.

[1:17:50.160 --> 1:17:56.160]  It is now time to reign in evil and bring them to justice.
[1:17:56.160 --> 1:17:58.160]  Through the authority that has been delegated to us,
[1:17:58.160 --> 1:18:01.160]  it is time to destroy the destroyers.
[1:18:01.160 --> 1:18:04.160]  The number of the mounted troops was 200 million,
[1:18:04.160 --> 1:18:06.160]  the vast majority of the population of the U.S.
[1:18:06.160 --> 1:18:08.160]  Though the people of the U.S.
[1:18:08.160 --> 1:18:10.160]  where their numbers and influence are strongest
[1:18:10.160 --> 1:18:12.160]  have primary responsibility for reigning the men
[1:18:12.160 --> 1:18:14.160]  and bringing them to justice.
[1:18:14.160 --> 1:18:17.160]  All nations will participate since they reside the world over.
[1:18:17.160 --> 1:18:19.160]  They are called Illuminati.
[1:18:19.160 --> 1:18:22.160]  Elite, proponents of the New World Order.
[1:18:22.160 --> 1:18:25.160]  They oppose everything that is God and truth.
[1:18:25.160 --> 1:18:28.160]  They are of the line that was disinherited 2,000 years ago.
[1:18:28.160 --> 1:18:30.160]  Everything they have built over the centuries,
[1:18:30.160 --> 1:18:32.160]  the wealth they have accumulated,
[1:18:32.160 --> 1:18:33.160]  the power they have established,
[1:18:33.160 --> 1:18:35.160]  the poisoning of the masses,
[1:18:35.160 --> 1:18:37.160]  the destruction of the earth and mankind,
[1:18:37.160 --> 1:18:39.160]  we will undo through the authority
[1:18:39.160 --> 1:18:41.160]  that has now been delegated to us.
[1:18:41.160 --> 1:18:45.160]  Visit our website at UnveilingThem.com.
[1:18:45.160 --> 1:18:49.160]  That's U-N-V-E-I-L-I-N-G them.com.
[1:18:49.160 --> 1:18:51.160]  The message of His Kingdom.
[1:18:51.160 --> 1:18:52.160]  It's a fact.
[1:18:52.160 --> 1:18:54.160]  Since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913,
[1:18:54.160 --> 1:18:56.160]  all banks in these United States
[1:18:56.160 --> 1:18:58.160]  create money out of thin air
[1:18:58.160 --> 1:19:00.160]  for every single loan they issue.
[1:19:00.160 --> 1:19:02.160]  With never-ending late fees over the limit fees
[1:19:02.160 --> 1:19:04.160]  and higher and higher interest rates,
[1:19:04.160 --> 1:19:06.160]  it has become mathematically impossible
[1:19:06.160 --> 1:19:07.160]  to repay all debt,
[1:19:07.160 --> 1:19:09.160]  making all of us slaves to our creditors.
[1:19:09.160 --> 1:19:11.160]  The Federal Debt Relief System
[1:19:11.160 --> 1:19:13.160]  has created a successful attorney-backed program
[1:19:13.160 --> 1:19:15.160]  to legally eliminate credit card debt,
[1:19:15.160 --> 1:19:16.160]  personal loans,
[1:19:16.160 --> 1:19:18.160]  lines of credit and other unsecured debts
[1:19:18.160 --> 1:19:20.160]  which have been fraudulently created by the banks.
[1:19:20.160 --> 1:19:22.160]  We can terminate your unsecured debt
[1:19:22.160 --> 1:19:24.160]  within 18 months with a much lower monthly payment,
[1:19:24.160 --> 1:19:26.160]  ending with nothing on your credit report.
[1:19:26.160 --> 1:19:28.160]  Join the thousands of Americans who now breathe
[1:19:28.160 --> 1:19:29.160]  with a sigh of relief
[1:19:29.160 --> 1:19:31.160]  because they have legally eliminated their debt.
[1:19:31.160 --> 1:19:33.160]  Instead of living each day in fear and frustration,
[1:19:33.160 --> 1:19:35.160]  it's time to take action and turn your life around.
[1:19:35.160 --> 1:19:37.160]  Call the Federal Debt Relief System
[1:19:37.160 --> 1:19:40.160]  at 877-943-8600.
[1:19:40.160 --> 1:19:43.160]  That's 877-943-8600.
[1:19:43.160 --> 1:19:45.160]  Or visit FDRS.org.
[1:19:45.160 --> 1:19:47.160]  Find out how you can break the cycle of debt slavery.
[1:19:47.160 --> 1:19:57.160]  Visit FDRS.org.
[1:20:28.160 --> 1:20:30.160]  Well, I know McCain and Obama
[1:20:30.160 --> 1:20:32.160]  are both going to go sit on top of the corpse
[1:20:32.160 --> 1:20:33.160]  of the black op,
[1:20:33.160 --> 1:20:34.160]  Reichstag attack
[1:20:34.160 --> 1:20:36.160]  and coming up in a few days in New York.
[1:20:36.160 --> 1:20:38.160]  And I know they've had some other 9-11 tributes
[1:20:38.160 --> 1:20:40.160]  that both Republicans and Democrats
[1:20:40.160 --> 1:20:41.160]  leaching off of it,
[1:20:41.160 --> 1:20:42.160]  training the slaves
[1:20:42.160 --> 1:20:44.160]  how to worship their abusers.
[1:20:44.160 --> 1:20:45.160]  Right, right.
[1:20:45.160 --> 1:20:47.160]  I wonder if you had caught that.
[1:20:47.160 --> 1:20:50.160]  You had brought up the whole 9-11 thing
[1:20:50.160 --> 1:20:51.160]  with Obama and McCain.
[1:20:51.160 --> 1:20:52.160]  Yes.
[1:20:52.160 --> 1:20:53.160]  The best way to undercut it
[1:20:53.160 --> 1:20:55.160]  is to use evidence.
[1:20:55.160 --> 1:20:56.160]  The reason I'm bringing it up
[1:20:56.160 --> 1:20:58.160]  is I'm wondering if you're still interested
[1:20:58.160 --> 1:21:00.160]  in the terror storm bibliography.
[1:21:00.160 --> 1:21:03.160]  Yes, if folks want to build us a terror storm bibliography
[1:21:03.160 --> 1:21:05.160]  and the bibliography checks out and is accurate,
[1:21:05.160 --> 1:21:06.160]  we'll do it.
[1:21:06.160 --> 1:21:07.160]  We had a big volunteer.
[1:21:07.160 --> 1:21:09.160]  I guess that's you who did
[1:21:09.160 --> 1:21:11.160]  WhatIsTheEndgame.com.
[1:21:11.160 --> 1:21:12.160]  Yeah, we had some wires crossed.
[1:21:12.160 --> 1:21:14.160]  I was trying to send it to you a couple of times
[1:21:14.160 --> 1:21:15.160]  in the past, but...
[1:21:15.160 --> 1:21:16.160]  Okay, great.
[1:21:16.160 --> 1:21:17.160]  Well, we had another fellow
[1:21:17.160 --> 1:21:19.160]  who did the Marshall Law Bibliography.
[1:21:19.160 --> 1:21:20.160]  You'd put a lot of work into
[1:21:20.160 --> 1:21:22.160]  WhatIsTheEndgame.com,
[1:21:22.160 --> 1:21:24.160]  the bibliography on that page.
[1:21:24.160 --> 1:21:26.160]  So why don't you get...
[1:21:26.160 --> 1:21:28.160]  Kurt is about to relaunch Prison Planet
[1:21:28.160 --> 1:21:30.160]  with a new design in the next week.
[1:21:30.160 --> 1:21:32.160]  But why don't you email Kurt,
[1:21:32.160 --> 1:21:34.160]  and I need to make him his own
[1:21:34.160 --> 1:21:35.160]  InfoWars email.
[1:21:35.160 --> 1:21:37.160]  Email Aaron at infowars.com
[1:21:37.160 --> 1:21:40.160]  and then we can give you
[1:21:40.160 --> 1:21:42.160]  the data page link or something
[1:21:42.160 --> 1:21:44.160]  so you can make a bibliography
[1:21:44.160 --> 1:21:47.160]  for any of the films you want to.
[1:21:47.160 --> 1:21:48.160]  Okay.
[1:21:48.160 --> 1:21:50.160]  Well, that was the last one I was going to do.
[1:21:50.160 --> 1:21:52.160]  I'm expecting other people to get off there.
[1:21:52.160 --> 1:21:53.160]  Well, they need to.
[1:21:53.160 --> 1:21:56.160]  What was it like doing the bibliography for...
[1:21:56.160 --> 1:21:57.160]  because obviously we have all the documents
[1:21:57.160 --> 1:21:58.160]  we made the film with,
[1:21:58.160 --> 1:22:00.160]  but this guy went out and reverse engineered it
[1:22:00.160 --> 1:22:02.160]  and even did bibliography
[1:22:02.160 --> 1:22:04.160]  for the video clips themselves.
[1:22:04.160 --> 1:22:06.160]  What was it like doing the research?
[1:22:06.160 --> 1:22:08.160]  Because you did the same research we did
[1:22:08.160 --> 1:22:10.160]  doing the bibliography into Endgame.
[1:22:10.160 --> 1:22:12.160]  Well, it...
[1:22:12.160 --> 1:22:14.160]  Well, I already knew the stuff, so...
[1:22:14.160 --> 1:22:15.160]  it wasn't really a big deal.
[1:22:15.160 --> 1:22:16.160]  Anybody hits a library,
[1:22:16.160 --> 1:22:17.160]  you'll find the stuff out.
[1:22:17.160 --> 1:22:18.160]  You know what?
[1:22:18.160 --> 1:22:19.160]  Give me your full name and number.
[1:22:19.160 --> 1:22:20.160]  Guys, get it from this great fellow.
[1:22:20.160 --> 1:22:22.160]  Gary, you know what?
[1:22:22.160 --> 1:22:23.160]  Pearls before swine.
[1:22:23.160 --> 1:22:25.160]  You've been throwing these pearls before us.
[1:22:25.160 --> 1:22:26.160]  You're the best.
[1:22:26.160 --> 1:22:28.160]  We're trying to hire more web people,
[1:22:28.160 --> 1:22:29.160]  gear up so we can, you know,
[1:22:29.160 --> 1:22:31.160]  use the great material people give us.
[1:22:31.160 --> 1:22:33.160]  But yes, I do want a new bibliography.
[1:22:33.160 --> 1:22:35.160]  What film was it you were saying
[1:22:35.160 --> 1:22:36.160]  you want to do one for?
[1:22:36.160 --> 1:22:37.160]  Territorial Special Edition,
[1:22:37.160 --> 1:22:39.160]  what I consider to be your second best film.
[1:22:39.160 --> 1:22:40.160]  Thank you.
[1:22:40.160 --> 1:22:41.160]  What do you think the best film is?
[1:22:41.160 --> 1:22:42.160]  Endgame.
[1:22:42.160 --> 1:22:44.160]  Yeah, Territorium Final Cut Special Edition,
[1:22:44.160 --> 1:22:46.160]  whatever you want to call it,
[1:22:46.160 --> 1:22:48.160]  is a really powerful film.
[1:22:48.160 --> 1:22:49.160]  And I will...
[1:22:49.160 --> 1:22:52.160]  I will get you in touch with my guys.
[1:22:52.160 --> 1:22:54.160]  And so I'm sorry we haven't been as responsive
[1:22:54.160 --> 1:22:55.160]  as we should be, my friend.
[1:22:55.160 --> 1:22:56.160]  No, that's what I understand.
[1:22:56.160 --> 1:22:57.160]  You're doing a great job.
[1:22:57.160 --> 1:22:59.160]  Hey, actually, are you going to be on the air
[1:22:59.160 --> 1:23:01.160]  Sunday, the week from today?
[1:23:01.160 --> 1:23:02.160]  Yes.
[1:23:02.160 --> 1:23:03.160]  Hey, can I come on the air with you
[1:23:03.160 --> 1:23:04.160]  and go over some stuff?
[1:23:04.160 --> 1:23:06.160]  I think it'll be an interesting conversation.
[1:23:06.160 --> 1:23:09.160]  Well, my producer is sitting in there right now
[1:23:09.160 --> 1:23:11.160]  and so let me just get your name and number
[1:23:11.160 --> 1:23:13.160]  and I recognize talking to you in the past
[1:23:13.160 --> 1:23:14.160]  but your last name and stuff
[1:23:14.160 --> 1:23:16.160]  and let's just set that up through...
[1:23:16.160 --> 1:23:17.160]  set that up through Trey.
[1:23:17.160 --> 1:23:19.160]  But give us a prelude.
[1:23:19.160 --> 1:23:22.160]  I mean, what is it particularly you wanted to talk about?
[1:23:22.160 --> 1:23:24.160]  Well, solutions.
[1:23:24.160 --> 1:23:27.160]  Ways to actually use what we know
[1:23:27.160 --> 1:23:30.160]  to actually move people.
[1:23:30.160 --> 1:23:32.160]  Take, for instance, the bibliography
[1:23:32.160 --> 1:23:34.160]  for Endgame or Terrorstorm.
[1:23:34.160 --> 1:23:36.160]  You have plenty of young people listening.
[1:23:36.160 --> 1:23:38.160]  All they need to do, say, you know,
[1:23:38.160 --> 1:23:40.160]  for any book, not book report,
[1:23:40.160 --> 1:23:43.160]  but any report they have to do to a class,
[1:23:43.160 --> 1:23:46.160]  say, to college, you got all your sources right there.
[1:23:46.160 --> 1:23:48.160]  Yeah, do one on Endgame and then educate
[1:23:48.160 --> 1:23:50.160]  the 30 kids in the government.
[1:23:50.160 --> 1:23:51.160]  Death Camp.
[1:23:51.160 --> 1:23:52.160]  Yeah, but don't do it on one where
[1:23:52.160 --> 1:23:54.160]  it's a paper that only a professor is going to see
[1:23:54.160 --> 1:23:56.160]  because they can try to shut you down
[1:23:56.160 --> 1:23:59.160]  and edit you and just mess over you with your grades.
[1:23:59.160 --> 1:24:01.160]  Yeah, do it for like a book report where you read it.
[1:24:01.160 --> 1:24:02.160]  Right, as an audience.
[1:24:02.160 --> 1:24:04.160]  Absolutely beautiful plan.
[1:24:04.160 --> 1:24:05.160]  What else, another solution?
[1:24:05.160 --> 1:24:07.160]  Well, confront people.
[1:24:07.160 --> 1:24:11.160]  As far as you need to make it essentially cool.
[1:24:11.160 --> 1:24:14.160]  That's what is used for us, Madison Avenue, right?
[1:24:14.160 --> 1:24:17.160]  Oh, people isn't cool to be a conspiracy theorist
[1:24:17.160 --> 1:24:18.160]  and all that nonsense.
[1:24:18.160 --> 1:24:20.160]  Well, it actually is the coolest thing you can be.
[1:24:20.160 --> 1:24:22.160]  You know, I mean, that's what all Hollywood,
[1:24:22.160 --> 1:24:24.160]  the government heads are into.
[1:24:24.160 --> 1:24:25.160]  Are you kidding?
[1:24:25.160 --> 1:24:27.160]  The main line, dying old media,
[1:24:27.160 --> 1:24:30.160]  dinosaur media is falling apart right now.
[1:24:30.160 --> 1:24:32.160]  So 9-Eleven, truth is dead when it's bigger
[1:24:32.160 --> 1:24:34.160]  than ever exploding everywhere.
[1:24:34.160 --> 1:24:36.160]  People don't listen to the alternative media anymore,
[1:24:36.160 --> 1:24:38.160]  but all the statistics show the opposite.
[1:24:38.160 --> 1:24:40.160]  The mainstream media is falling because they lie too much.
[1:24:40.160 --> 1:24:41.160]  That's it, my friend.
[1:24:41.160 --> 1:24:42.160]  Well, Trey's got the microphone over there.
[1:24:42.160 --> 1:24:43.160]  What's going on, Trey?
[1:24:43.160 --> 1:24:45.160]  I just want to say I've been stealing it,
[1:24:45.160 --> 1:24:47.160]  seeing everyone steal your MO.
[1:24:47.160 --> 1:24:50.160]  Every time I watch an investigative news show
[1:24:50.160 --> 1:24:51.160]  like on MSNBC or something,
[1:24:51.160 --> 1:24:53.160]  they've always got a camera in the street
[1:24:53.160 --> 1:24:57.160]  or they were going into looking at like a lobbyist,
[1:24:57.160 --> 1:24:59.160]  you know, being whined and dined and stuff
[1:24:59.160 --> 1:25:01.160]  and took secret cams and then confronted them
[1:25:01.160 --> 1:25:02.160]  when they found them on the street.
[1:25:02.160 --> 1:25:03.160]  So everyone's doing what you're doing.
[1:25:03.160 --> 1:25:05.160]  You've opened up a whole new realm.
[1:25:05.160 --> 1:25:07.160]  Well, I don't want to say that I invented all of that.
[1:25:07.160 --> 1:25:09.160]  I mean, I would say Michael Moore
[1:25:09.160 --> 1:25:11.160]  or some of the investigative journalists before him did.
[1:25:11.160 --> 1:25:13.160]  Now, this confronting politicians,
[1:25:13.160 --> 1:25:15.160]  not as media, but as activists,
[1:25:15.160 --> 1:25:16.160]  and then following them around
[1:25:16.160 --> 1:25:17.160]  and having other citizens do it.
[1:25:17.160 --> 1:25:20.160]  And the first viral videos really were mine.
[1:25:20.160 --> 1:25:22.160]  The first political viral videos,
[1:25:22.160 --> 1:25:25.160]  anti-neural order stuff, were my films.
[1:25:25.160 --> 1:25:26.160]  And so that's my claim to fame.
[1:25:26.160 --> 1:25:28.160]  Well, listen, we're going to get your full info there.
[1:25:28.160 --> 1:25:29.160]  Okay.
[1:25:29.160 --> 1:25:30.160]  Gary, I got a whole butter.
[1:25:30.160 --> 1:25:31.160]  I'll never get to anybody.
[1:25:31.160 --> 1:25:32.160]  Yeah, you got a whole show.
[1:25:32.160 --> 1:25:33.160]  Get back.
[1:25:33.160 --> 1:25:34.160]  All right.
[1:25:34.160 --> 1:25:35.160]  Thank you.
[1:25:35.160 --> 1:25:36.160]  You're awesome.
[1:25:36.160 --> 1:25:37.160]  Okay.
[1:25:37.160 --> 1:25:38.160]  Get him on hold.
[1:25:38.160 --> 1:25:39.160]  Get his info.
[1:25:39.160 --> 1:25:40.160]  Okay.
[1:25:40.160 --> 1:25:41.160]  Let's talk to Randall in Washington.
[1:25:41.160 --> 1:25:42.160]  Thanks for holding Randall.
[1:25:42.160 --> 1:25:43.160]  Hey, Alex.
[1:25:43.160 --> 1:25:44.160]  Thanks for taking my call.
[1:25:44.160 --> 1:25:45.160]  Thanks for calling.
[1:25:45.160 --> 1:25:46.160]  What's on your mind?
[1:25:46.160 --> 1:25:47.160]  Okay.
[1:25:47.160 --> 1:25:48.160]  Chemtrails.
[1:25:48.160 --> 1:25:50.160]  That has been my focus of what I'm going to do
[1:25:50.160 --> 1:25:52.160]  to take action against all the stuff that you're bringing up.
[1:25:52.160 --> 1:25:53.160]  Well, here's the problem.
[1:25:53.160 --> 1:25:55.160]  The Chemtrail researchers never talked about the fact
[1:25:55.160 --> 1:25:56.160]  of the government.
[1:25:56.160 --> 1:25:57.160]  He classified it all.
[1:25:57.160 --> 1:25:59.160]  It's kind of like everybody talks about secret FEMA camps,
[1:25:59.160 --> 1:26:01.160]  but never holds up the Houston Chronicle or Newsmax
[1:26:01.160 --> 1:26:03.160]  or White House.gov.
[1:26:03.160 --> 1:26:05.160]  They have built camps for the American people.
[1:26:05.160 --> 1:26:07.160]  And there's congressional hearings.
[1:26:07.160 --> 1:26:08.160]  I have it all right here.
[1:26:08.160 --> 1:26:10.160]  They're spraying sulfur dioxide.
[1:26:10.160 --> 1:26:13.160]  They're spraying barium salts over every U.S. city.
[1:26:13.160 --> 1:26:16.160]  And they admit it causes...
[1:26:16.160 --> 1:26:17.160]  Hold on.
[1:26:17.160 --> 1:26:19.160]  It causes neurological effects and behavioral changes.
[1:26:19.160 --> 1:26:20.160]  This is the federal government.
[1:26:20.160 --> 1:26:22.160]  The disturbance of blood circulation, heart damage,
[1:26:22.160 --> 1:26:25.160]  effects on eyesight and eyes, reproductive failure,
[1:26:25.160 --> 1:26:28.160]  damage to immune systems, stomach and gastrointestinal disorder.
[1:26:28.160 --> 1:26:29.160]  They go...
[1:26:29.160 --> 1:26:30.160]  I'm sorry.
[1:26:30.160 --> 1:26:32.160]  Liver damage, kidney function, hearing defects,
[1:26:32.160 --> 1:26:35.160]  disturbances in the hormonal metabolic system,
[1:26:35.160 --> 1:26:37.160]  dermatological effects, suffocation and lung embolism.
[1:26:37.160 --> 1:26:38.160]  Sorry.
[1:26:38.160 --> 1:26:39.160]  Go ahead.
[1:26:39.160 --> 1:26:41.160]  Well, you know, and along that line,
[1:26:41.160 --> 1:26:43.160]  I can lay a map of Texas.
[1:26:43.160 --> 1:26:44.160]  And I have this.
[1:26:44.160 --> 1:26:45.160]  I have a map of Texas.
[1:26:45.160 --> 1:26:47.160]  You can show live satellite video that they've got
[1:26:47.160 --> 1:26:48.160]  links to on the web.
[1:26:48.160 --> 1:26:49.160]  And it's just spray trails everywhere.
[1:26:49.160 --> 1:26:50.160]  Go ahead.
[1:26:50.160 --> 1:26:52.160]  But I've got a prevalence of autism.
[1:26:52.160 --> 1:26:56.160]  And then you lay over that where they spray the heaviest,
[1:26:56.160 --> 1:26:58.160]  and it's almost the same identical map.
[1:26:58.160 --> 1:27:00.160]  Well, it is the metals that cause the neuron damage
[1:27:00.160 --> 1:27:01.160]  in the babies.
[1:27:01.160 --> 1:27:04.160]  And so it screws up the connection between the cerebral cortex
[1:27:04.160 --> 1:27:07.160]  and the main areas of the brain.
[1:27:07.160 --> 1:27:08.160]  And you're absolutely right.
[1:27:08.160 --> 1:27:10.160]  And then taking the inoculations boosts that.
[1:27:10.160 --> 1:27:13.160]  But yes, aluminum, barium, sulfur dioxide,
[1:27:13.160 --> 1:27:15.160]  all of this is toxic to the brain.
[1:27:15.160 --> 1:27:18.160]  So let me tell you how I'm doing it, how I'm battling this.
[1:27:18.160 --> 1:27:22.160]  First of all, every state has a law on weather modification.
[1:27:22.160 --> 1:27:27.160]  Just type in your state law and then weather modification.
[1:27:27.160 --> 1:27:30.160]  Sometimes they're, they call it weather mitigation.
[1:27:30.160 --> 1:27:31.160]  Okay.
[1:27:31.160 --> 1:27:34.160]  Second thing I've done is I've taken samples out of my yard.
[1:27:34.160 --> 1:27:35.160]  I found a local lab.
[1:27:35.160 --> 1:27:38.160]  I'm having them analyzed for barium and aluminum.
[1:27:38.160 --> 1:27:41.160]  And also what we've done is, is now all over the country,
[1:27:41.160 --> 1:27:43.160]  mainline newscast see it sprayed.
[1:27:43.160 --> 1:27:44.160]  They tested it.
[1:27:44.160 --> 1:27:46.160]  It is aluminum, barium, sulfur dioxide.
[1:27:46.160 --> 1:27:50.160]  And the local news is filming the planes fly spraying them.
[1:27:50.160 --> 1:27:51.160]  Right.
[1:27:51.160 --> 1:27:53.160]  According to our state law in the state of Washington,
[1:27:53.160 --> 1:27:56.160]  I have a right to know, and I'm going to go to the governor with this.
[1:27:56.160 --> 1:27:57.160]  This is the third thing.
[1:27:57.160 --> 1:28:00.160]  On the 15th, I'm attending a legislative reception.
[1:28:00.160 --> 1:28:02.160]  I'm going to go to the governor with my results,
[1:28:02.160 --> 1:28:04.160]  with the pictures of the spraying up above,
[1:28:04.160 --> 1:28:08.160]  with the statistics on what barium does,
[1:28:08.160 --> 1:28:11.160]  and the legislative bills that are currently in the house,
[1:28:11.160 --> 1:28:15.160]  and ask her if she will support me in cleaning up our skies.
[1:28:15.160 --> 1:28:17.160]  And by the way, this is all admitted in Congress.
[1:28:17.160 --> 1:28:18.160]  There's funding.
[1:28:18.160 --> 1:28:20.160]  It's in the London Guardian everywhere.
[1:28:20.160 --> 1:28:23.160]  And thousands of universities admit they're part of it.
[1:28:23.160 --> 1:28:25.160]  But then you tell the cattle, and they go,
[1:28:25.160 --> 1:28:28.160]  moo, like a dumb cow, and say it doesn't exist.
[1:28:28.160 --> 1:28:32.160]  Alex, I have a plan to get to the cattle, too.
[1:28:32.160 --> 1:28:33.160]  Do you want to hear it?
[1:28:33.160 --> 1:28:35.160]  Well, I mean, if they tell the cattle, there's not a sky.
[1:28:35.160 --> 1:28:36.160]  They'll start saying there's no sky.
[1:28:36.160 --> 1:28:38.160]  But yeah, I'll put you on hold.
[1:28:38.160 --> 1:28:39.160]  Come back to you real quick after the news.
